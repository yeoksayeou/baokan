<p>時評</p>
<h3>麵粉業之救濟源</h3>
<p>近日報載粉業巨子榮宗敬氏與顧馨一氏之談話。對于粉業前途。十分悲觀。令人回憶四五月間該業向政府請願救濟之呼聲。其時粉價每袋已跌入二元以内。開數年來未有之低價。以致各廠虧蝕累累。不得已而請政府救濟焉。迨後粉價。忽然轉機。逐日上升。至八月中旬。曾一度達二元八角左右。但自八月下旬以來。則又逐日下降。近數日内。跌風尤盛。其價已在二元二角以内。將來是否不再回復四五月間之危狀。雖非吾人所能預測。然鑒於跌風之猛烈。市况之黯淡。則亦深覺榮顧二氏之言非過慮也。</p>
<p>查粉業不景氣之最大原因。實爲東北四省淪亡之故。蓋吾國麵粉。向以東北爲尾閭。自僞满成立以後。加徵進口粉稅。遂置我國粉于死地。向在東北固有之市塲。乃漸爲日澳洋粉所侵佔。日積月累。遂有此四五月間之狀况也。關於此點當時粉商與政府。俱能認識。故爲粉業謀救濟者。亦以此爲努力之中心但其後粉市忽起變化。早升夕漲。富有生氣。於是一切對策。亦遂置之不議。不知當時粉價之所以忽然暴漲。實因一般投機家鑒于國内旱象已著。糧價騰上。故皆爲之推波助瀾。以圖厚利。一旦投機熱退。而粉價又日下趨矣。可見東北市塲旣失。粉業已受一致命之打擊。來日大難。甚少樂觀之希望也。</p>
<p>據最近大連海關報吿國粉輸入僅占進口粉全數百分之五。其大部份之市塲。俱爲日澳粉所侵占。夫欲恢復已失之故土。必藉軍事上之準備有充分實力而後可。若欲恢復已失之市塲。則藉國家經濟力量。有幾分經濟力量。卽可進行幾分工作。故今後國粉。如欲在東北與日澳粉相競爭。必先由廠商與政府共同奮鬥。充實經濟競爭之能力。其在廠商者。應謀各廠自身組織之改進。使其管理科學化。蓋惟成本低廉。岀品精美。然後始有競爭之資格。而廠與廠間。亦應謀一種連合組織。使其產銷合理化。對外取一致步調。以求合夫商戰之條件。其在政府者。應本鼓勵與扶助實業之天職。予岀口麵粉以相當補助金。或將岀口粉所已完納之統稅。全部退回。（現照統稅條例應退回一半）如是則岀口之粉。成本减輕。始有與日澳粉競爭之可能。一方面於我國内市塲。設法抑止洋粉進口。使國粉不爲洋粉所排擠。而後國粉可以立足。吾人鑒于絲業之覆轍。對于粉業前途。不無憂慮。但願廠商速自振作。政府盡力輔助。則粉業前途。未嘗不可以重臻繁榮也。</p>

<p>（各種貨幣發行總額）　我東北舊日流通之各種通貨、到民國十八年底、屬本國所發行者約爲一億九千餘萬元、日本所發行者約爲六千萬銀元、到十九年底、我國約一億九千五百萬銀元、僞中央銀行所發行者約一億八千萬銀元、關於第一種所述之十五種紙幣、僞中央銀行於創業伊始所規定之兌換率、定爲一億四千二百二十三萬四千八百七十二元僞幣、可先行整理兌換幣額一億四千二百餘萬元、試將前年七月一日僞中央銀行創立以來收回上列之十五種舊紙幣數額之比較、列表如次、（單位千元）</p>

<p>如右表舊幣之總額一億四千二百二十餘萬元、到本年三月底、已被收回八成二分亦舊紙幣殘存額爲一成八分、計二千六百五十萬元、這里尚有一千萬元哈爾濱大洋票、其餘十四種紙幣　收回之數目計有一千六百五十萬元、以後績行收回者、據云各地僞中央銀行及長春總行、對於收回舊幣事務、其行員忙於兌換、雖星期日亦不休息、大槪平均每月兌換在六百萬元左右、想最近亦當如數收回、</p>
<p>（其他雜幣收回辦法）　爐銀在營口金融機關市塲交易轉匯通行上、佔重要位置、但爐銀從來支付資金貧乏、故發行一種空虛票子、（過爐銀支票、）這種票子、在營口商統間通貨交易裹、尤佔重要的地位、日本爲賣現統一幣制之陰謀、所以藉口整理爐銀、决定廢止、於去年十一月四日、頒布僞令、給營口商工會收回各爐銀、如是過去八十年間特殊存在之營口爐銀、遂被廢除、整頓爐銀的換算額、定爲僞幣二千一百九十萬元、收回公定率是僞幣一元換爐銀四角、但爐銀係一種不換紙幣、且在營口財界、已者甚深之根底、一旦廢除、營口財界勢將紊亂、因之日人藉口救濟財界紊亂計、又有營口商業銀行之設立、該行資本爲一百萬元、收足每股二十元者五萬股、業已在去年十二月一日正式業、鎭平銀是一種現銀、和爐銀不同、所謂鎭平銀、是安東習慣上鎭平秤計算、經安東公估局（銀兩鑑定證明所）之鑑定、證明付給之馬路蹄銀、僅可在安東　用、現在流通額最多不過三百萬元、鎭平銀由來頗古、去今有六百五十八年的歷史、相傳起於元代至元十三年、（西歷一二七六年元世祖時代）現日人嗾使僞財政部、於本年四月二十日、公布廢止鎭平銀、（一）本年十月一日以後、禁止新造鎭平銀的交易、（二）公估周公認的鎭平銀、至本年十二月三十一日止、以僞幣百圓換七十兩二錢買賣之、（三）安東公估局、於本年四月三十日停閉、即依據右列布吿、迄本年九月三十日以前爲凖備期間、十月一日</p>

<p>以後廢止新造鎭平銀的交易、一方爲促進鎭平銀易於兌換僞幣起見、乃决斷的限制於去年四月底即停閉公估局、且僞中央銀行到本年底止之期間、以僞幣百元換鎭平銀七十玫二錢的換算率收回之、私帖之類、在營口爐銀裹雖已提過、然此外還有個人發行的私帖、尤其是九一八事變後各縣發行的救濟券·流通券等等、對於這種私帖、又有去年七月五日公佈的一私帖及其他類似紙幣證券取締暫行辦法從來通用的、限爲已受到發行官署的認可、或三個月内受得僞組織的認可、則當時限定的流通額定爲一年期間仍可照常通用、即是說除這些私帖以外的就是没有得官署公認之私帖、和全然未得官署公認私人商店所發行私帖、而經如右述的得官署公認者、自去年七月五日以後、則現在因已满限期、所有一切私帖都禁止通用、</p>
<p>（收回舊幣錢商呌苦）　在東北金融界中、根底最深的奉天票等十五種舊紙幣、已一步一步被僞幣报替代、現在所　的極屬少數、至流通券和私帖等、也多被收消滅、至六月三十日止、無論是十五種舊貨幣與其他私帖、均　無用、至七月以後、則地方收稅和稅外收入、决定以僞幣岀納、基於上面所述、日人整理東北通貨工作、表面似極順利、然竟以此謂於東北金融界有良好影響、則尚不能言、因爲確立幣制、素以　雜舊通貨爲營業蓋礎的、如錢莊自不免要發行營業上的變動、錢莊是從來一般商人相依爲命的金融機關、是在雜多的通貨價値之變動、各種通貨間之交換價差異的利益上、生來的一種營業、就是錢莊對一般商人除貨欵業務外、通貨買賣的利益、算是主要的營業、所以因爲日人統制幣制致失去了這種營業、例如瀋陽現在存在之二十餘家　莊、失掉右述的利益、不能不蒙受打擊、甚至破產、</p>

<h3>劉湘駐滬代表鄧鳴階談川事</h3>
<p>劉氏卽可復職</p>
<p>川中金融穏定</p>

<h3>利濟私訂合同</h3>
<p>武穴並非通商口岸</p>
<p>何得擅許外輪停靠</p>
<p>官廳澈究航商力爭</p>
<p>長江航路内、洋商輪較國輪爲多、但限定在通商口岸停靠、此外不准兼航、武穴埠、爲内地口岸、太古·怡和·日清·等輪、經過武穴時、祇准抛泊江心、旅客上落、祇用小船渡駁、不准停靠岸邊、惟在一二八前、日清公司、一度在武穴設躉停船、當時由航商力爭、經武漢當局交涉、日輪始將躉船撤去、</p>
<h3>私擅訂約</h3>
<p>武穴沿江、困各輪公司未設碼頭、故設置躉船、係由利濟公司设貲承辦、共有三艘、專供上下水長江船靠泊、以裝卸客貨爲營業、由該躉船抽收佣金、而停船則另行給費、近來該公司將躉船擅與洋商各輪、訂立停泊裝貨合同、聞英商太古怡和·日商日清等各公司、已與訂約、顯係破壞向例、妨碍航權、</p>
<h3>官廳澈查</h3>
<p>現已有人、向湖北省建設廳報吿、請求澈究、蘇浙皖贛鄂五省行政委員、亦接據報吿、事關内河航權、値茲進行收回之際、豈可由私人公司、擅與洋商訂約、故亦會同鄂建廳、澈查此事原委、鄂建廳因國營招商局長江輪、到武穴時靠停利濟躉船、特函致該局、調取其所訂合同、並徵詢對於此案意見、以憑核辦</p>
<h3>航商力爭</h3>
<p>招商局現已將利濟公司所訂合同抄奉、滬上航商、對於此事、亦認爲有損主權、應由利濟公司權衡輕重、立卽撤廢合同、一面改招中國江輪停泊、萬一該公司收支不敷、則由鄂建廳按年酌予補助、庶商情國權、並皆兼顧、</p>

<h3>麵粉狂跌原因</h3>
<p>國外價格跌落</p>
<p>滬上存貨囤積</p>
<p>中央社云、關於麵粉價格、邇來發生空前狂跌風潮、以致日前本市麵粉易所、對於粉市且有追證停拍一事、中央社記者、由糧食界所得消息、此次狂跌原因、一則由國外市塲上麥粉價格跌多漲少、一則由於本市麵粉忽受阻滯、以致存貨囤積而邇來米市亦見步跌、米價與雜糧格之升降、關係頗多、前月米價看高時麵粉價格因亦跟高、惟邇因新米登塲、米價一致趨跌、麵粉價格不無影響、故目前若干較小之粉廠、已有停機之虞、將來究將如何設法救濟、尚待各方考慮云、</p>

<p>實施生產敎育之管見（三）</p>
<h3>市敎局長潘公展在本市第三區敎育會會員大會演講汪公遐速記</h3>
<p>（没有錢能够迎頭趕上去）、我們應該怎樣去辦生產敎育呢、依我個人的意思第一要學校生產化職業化中等學校固然可以辦生產學校、小學校是國民敎育、是基本敎育、似乎不能一律改辦生產學校、但是要除專爲識字的短期小學外、也可把生產敎育的成分盡量的放進小學裹去、換句話說、就是我們要在現有的中小學經費可能範圍之内設法使中小學的課程設備生產化、譬</p>
<p>如就上海市來說、市立中等學校有敬業、務本、洋涇、吳淞、及新陸師範等五校、我們應該怎麽辦、假定我們在這五個學校之内、祇先承認一個優良的普通中學、男女合校、繼續照正軌的中學辦下去、造就初中高中畢業後預備升大學的一般學生、這個學校的學生的天資體格和學問都要特别的優良一切考試要十分認眞、管理也要特别嚴厲、將來可使這些較優秀的學校得到高深的造就、除了一個普通的中學校之外、師範學校也要承認的、但是這個師範學校造就岀來的學生、除了敎書本上的知識之外、至少要使師範生有一種工業或農業的技能、尤其預備將來在鄕村執敎的師範生、對於農業和手工藝格外應有自已動手的技能和經騐、這樣、名稱固然是師範學校、而實際上也確能與生產連合、除了一個普通中學和一個師範學校之外、其餘的三個中等學校都可酌改爲高級或初級生產學校、課程重加支配、有所側重、至少要有個小小的農塲或工塲或其他事業的實習塲所、這樣即使名義上仍爲普通中學、不改名稱、而實際已成爲職業化生產化的中學、同時在經費上並無多大變更、至多略爲增加一點設備經費也或者還可以設法、這不是比較經濟的辦法嗎、</p>
<p>小學校怎樣呢、我們可以把小學分了兩類、一類是專爲普及識字而設、要可以單辦短期小學或兒童民衆學校另一類是爲了升學而辦的小學、也要設法向生產方面努力、小學校的學生年齡、自然不能就有生產能力、不過、至少要使他們打好一個將來到生產中學校讀書求技能的基礎、萬不能再使他們全體或大多數存一個升中學升大學岀洋做官發財的心思、小學畢業生完全一步一步的升中學、升大學、岀洋留學、這是夢想、因爲有財力學等等的限制、初小升高小的不過七分之一、高小升初中的不過三分之一、初中升高中的不過四分之一、所以一萬個初小學生中間千入大學的、不到五百人、但是我們看現在的小學敎育、幾乎可以說完全是爲了升學假使畢業後不升學、就没有絲毫生產興趣和生產能力的基礎、所以我們在小學敎育裹面實在要注意到與自然科學接近的科目、使他們有生產的基礎、將來升入生產學校也可以使他們認爲满意、這個一方面先要我們做敎師的一齊盡力把學生與學生家長的頭腦轉變過來、使他們知道現辱、進普通中學不以爲榮、不要再以爲進普通中學將來大學畢業後可以做大官、進生產學校將來祇能做農人工人商人、至多做廠長經理工頭、没有岀息、另一方面、趕緊設立小的農塲或工塲、使他們有練習生產技能的機會、這樣、雖然不是生產小學的名義、而與生產的環境技能接近、已可以將生產敎育的基礎打好了、（未完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我們要什麽的批評家</h3>
<p>— 丁一山</p>
<p>這題目太不新鮮了，正因此這里才用。有許多事在新鮮之下弄得人頭昏，到後來，會不覺好笑。這現象在文壇上，尤其是在批評及介紹方面，是不難發現的。</p>
<p>有一位作家在私人信件中說有人批評了他的書，但批評者却不知道他文章中取材的來源，因此頗生感慨。</p>
<p>撇開文壇上好的批評家不提，有的（批評家）不過是看了幾本外國文學批評的書笈，便東指西責，自視不凡。把外國的理論用在中國，只能作爲借助，但超過借助而成爲應用時，就有了問題，文學理論雖無國界，但在應用上，相對的空間的與時間的相當差異究竟是有的。</p>
<p>拾提外國的理論而應戰的批評家似乎有的是，而且又有來路的不同、或是美國的，或是日本的，或是歐洲的，於是在批評家之中有了彼此亂戰的現象。</p>
<p>在中國目前各種客觀條件政治，經濟，敎育程度，社會制度，生產技術，文化背景之下，能否把别國的文學理論全搬來應用，是頗成問題的。我們有自已的特殊國情，我們雖不妨借助於由别種特殊國情而生的文學理論，我們却更需要我們自已的批評家。</p>
<p>第一，他必是熟悉中國國情的，對於中國的社會現狀及歷史文化有相當的研究與認識。換言之，他必須有過社會科學的修養，再根據這方面的修養而認識了中國的特殊國情，而批評文學作品，指岀文章中的長短，描寫是否合乎情理，文章對於讀者的影響（這又要有實際的觀察），及如何使文學作品中的描寫能正確地表達特殊的國情。</p>
<p>再者，豐富的知識與經騐也是必要的。一個批評家不只是空洞地挑弄幾個名詞說說作品的好壞就了事。他至少要有與作者相等的學力與經騐，要能糾正作者的粗心處。至於易忽略的錯誤及歪曲的觀念，必得批評家有了豐富的知識與經騐才能指岀。</p>
<p>此外，批評家要有客觀的態度。公正的批評家便不該爲了（拉捧）及仇恨而亂說。固然我們不能要他不爲稿費而寫文章，但多少要爲批評而客觀地批評。</p>
<p>公正的，有豐富知識與經騐而了解中國國情的批評家才能使批評走上健康的大道，扶助文章的發展，才能使讀者及作者心服。無謂的批評，寗可没有。</p>
<h3>舍資之夜</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>殘缺的凋樓，頂上張着一些遮風雨的黃篾蓆，立在金黃夕陽照着的鎭口，極彷彿一個頭纏綳帶的傷兵，頽唐乏力地站在那裹，勉盡守護的責任一樣。</p>
<p>在遠遠的田間道上，望見這幅夕照中的風景畫時，我知道在旅途上所說的舍資已經在旅人的面前岀現了。於是，在没人烟的荒野裹，在黑鬱鬱的松嶺上，在冷浸浸的山峽中，所懷抱着的懍慄心情，至此，便全然從胸間一下子滑脫掉了。</p>
<p>舖着麥苗油菜和　豆苗的鎭外小原野，先前抺上的金黃夕輝，隨着通紅落日的下墜，逐漸褪色了，暗暗換上着春天的向暮的薄霧。人在夜色迷濛中，叱着歸去的牛羣。裊起晚烟的村屋下，送來幾聲懶懶的犬吠。週遭人家的燈火都在霎着怡人的眼睛。</p>
<p>這是旅人應該找尋歸宿的時候了。</p>
<p>大約由於單身一人，没帶貨物，又是說的外鄕方言吧，我被鎭上的好幾個住户搖手拒絶了，於是帶着一個小包袱和一點點哀愁，就在釘着鵝卵石的街道上躑躅起來。</p>
<p>一條街上没有燈，只是松明子的火燄，帶着黑色的濃烟尾巴，在壁上的小鐵盤中，隨着　頭滾滾下來的晚風，驚惶地跳躍着。穿便衣掮土槍的團丁，常常從肩上偏過臉來，閃着兩隻鋒利的眼睛。</p>
<p>天涯的旅愁，人間的冷酷，像兩條蛇似地，偷偷逡進我的心頭。</p>
<p>只有在土階邊擺攤子賣燒酒和小吃的人，在對我舉着歡迎的臉色。那末，喝一杯吧，這樣想着，就將疲倦極了的身子蹲了下去，風從松明子上吹過，挾着多量的濃烟，一陣陣地直朝臉上衝來，也不用管得了。我這時是需要一點温暖的人情，和暫時的安息的。</p>
<p>（呵）</p>
<p>只說是買幾個銅板的，但遞在我手上的酒，却是满满的一飯碗，便不得不令我着驚了，因爲我是不會喝這麽多的酒的。</p>
<p>（這裹的酒很好呵！）</p>
<p>旁邊蹲着一個微帶醉意的人一面剥着落花生，一面喝着酒，舉着温和的眼光，望我一下，就這樣說着，好像在讚美着酒，又好像在勸我暢飲的樣子。</p>
<p>（味道還好！）</p>
<p>我把酒碗放在唇邊，無意地說岀這一句，他就提高嗓子接着道··</p>
<p>（是的呀！一吃就曉得不錯了。）</p>
<p>世界上啫好相同的人，大槪總容易鶉識起來吧，於是我和他便很自然地開始談東談西，而這個仇視陌生人的鎭市，也似乎慢慢地在我面前變好了。等我把只飲一點子的酒，全部倒在他的碗裹時，他那隻粘着猪腸子油的手，也高興地朝我的肩頭拍起來了，竟然說着這樣親切的話。</p>
<p>（我們是喜歡客人的，爲啥不到我家去敲門呢？）</p>
<p>臨走的時候他對着賣酒的伸岀三根指頭來，朝空中比了一比，喃喃不清地說道··</p>
<p>（幾着，幾着，連上一次，一共山百哪）（記着記着，連上一次，一共三百哪。）</p>
<p>賣酒的人搔着盤有辫子的頭，做岀極其爲難的臉色。</p>
<p>（多少給一點吧，明天，嗯，看，没貨了，）</p>
<p>將他的一雙手，朝松明子照耀着的小攤子上，用力地擺了兩擺。隨卽說道··</p>
<p>（你呌他先把住夜的錢給你吧！）</p>
<p>又掉過眼光來望着我，很親切地位了我一把。</p>
<p>（一樣的，你先給他好了！）</p>
<p>我便答允了，因爲他是這個鎭上唯一能够給我以温暖的人，卽使不該岀住夜的錢，也應該加以慷慨援助的。</p>
<p>一路由我扶着他偏偏倒倒地走了回去。街上松明子的火光，已在開始微弱了黑暗的影子，大胆地從天空落了下來。遠處起着敲梆的聲音，鎭市的喧囂和熱閙，好像早已偷偷地溜溜開了。在一家人的木板門上，我由他的吩咐，輕輕的敲着。</p>
<p>（那個呀？）</p>
<p>一個女孩子尖聲地問。我將他的手肘拖了一下，問他道··</p>
<p>（是你的女兒嗎？）</p>
<p>（唔唔）他點點頭，我就對裹面應聲說··</p>
<p>（是你的爸爸回來了哪）。</p>
<p>（哪一個東西？哪一個東西？）</p>
<p>一個女人突然生氣地大呌起來了。他連忙拉着我就走，小聲急說道··</p>
<p>（快走，快走，糟溔，糟糕，弄錯了弄錯了。）</p>
<p>他在街上跌了幾下，踉踉蹌蹌地走着，後面送來一連串駡人的組聲。</p>
<p>（挨刀刀兒的，挨棒棒兒的，···）</p>
<p>他簡直醉糊塗了，家也找不着。同時給猛烈的冷風陡然一吹，酒性越加發作了。倘若没有我來扶着他走，他定會軟倒在街頭的。我同他到底住在什麽地方，他只會唔地回答着嘴邊冒岀一點點白色的泡沫。</p>
<p>幸好遇着一個團丁，才終於問着他的家了，但拍了半天的門，却只聽見裹面一兩聲咒駡的回應。</p>
<p>（酒鬼，那個呌你回來的？你怎麽不醉死在外面哪！）</p>
<p>後來一個小女兒的聲音，在低沉地訴說··</p>
<p>（媽媽！媽媽！）</p>
<p>（什麽？你想替他開門嗎？看我捶死你！）</p>
<p>我知道没有進去的希望了，轉身來看他，這個可憐的酒徒，他已稻草人一樣，軟軟地倒在階下睡着了，鼻裹正起着不急不徐的鼾聲。</p>
<p>（唉，老中國人呵！）</p>
<p>我只好也坐在他的身邊，無可如何地打着盹。</p>
<p>靜靜的夜，圍繞在我倆的周遭。敲梆梆的聲音息了之後，遠遠的原野中，（也許山那面），便穏穏約約地送來了一下兩下土槍的鳴響。</p>
<h3>緑与白</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>航空術的新發明</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>法國科學家新近發明一種新方法，使飛機飛在空中，十分安穏，升起降落，毫無危險，並且幾全岀於自動的機關，現在已經由法國空軍採用了，據說這個發明，可成航空史上的一種革命，可使法國空軍獨霸天空，近來科學家曾試騐用無綫電駕駛無人司機的飛機，現在有了這個新發明，飛行家安坐在辦公室中，一手把着無綫電的開關，指揮遠處飛機的進退，這件事不久定可實現了。</p>
<p>這種新方法，是根據旋轉儀的原則，製造一套簡單的安全機件，使飛機旋轉和堅起，直下和平飛，全可隨飛機師之意，安穏無比，各種動作，只須用手指按類把鈕一撳就行，這種簡單的駕駛術，駕機師當然稱便，即未受過訓練的人，也一學就會的。</p>
<p>這個發明，使飛機在雲中霧中，或飛在完全黑暗中，可保萬無一失，不致於因速率太快，一時煞機不及，遭遇意外，就是在黑暗中降落，也比從前容易得多了。</p>
<p>這種方法，是法國三位技術工程師達伊倫·喬治·阿維林·會同另外裴那第·和格里尼兩人研究數年發明的，他們從一九三三年七月起，到本年七月底止，在馬賽附近伊斯飛行塲用各種飛機試騐多次，有經騐的航空家和技術專家在塲仔細參觀，都說這個發明航空的前途是有極大關係的，經過許多次試騐之後，法國空軍就採用了，不久法國飛機都要裝配這種新式機件。</p>
<p>這機件是一排五個鈕子，支配升，降，平飛，左轉，右轉，五項事，五個鈕子都接通一個面版，據說比手扳機關，凖確得多哩，並且降只要把鈕子一撳，那飛機就自然升降，這是連兒童都會的，升降是飛行中最要的兩種運動，在那時駕機師最担心思，從此却可寫寫意意的飛行了，將來再進一步，能在一個很遠的中央地點，用無綫電波控制這五個鈕子，那末，遇到戰爭時，就可在大本營發岀許多架轟炸機，不必由人駕駛，自會飛到敵境空中，從事轟炸了，這豈不是與軍事上有絶大的關係麽，所以據法國航空專家的意見，現在這個發明，不但能使航空進步，還能造成一種飛行史上的新革命哩。</p>
<h3>鄕長先生（十九）</h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>馮文先生這回可裝作老内行似地點着頭，嘴裹應着（哼！唔！哼！唔！）是鄕長哇！想不岀計策，總得裝做個（批准）似的態度呀！一邊又那麽地想。於是開口跟班長說了。</p>
<p>（班長！）馮文先生先前爲了没法供應，不期然地表現岀來的狼狽情形，此刻可全没了。說話的聲音，也怪響亮的了。（我以爲我鄕長也够盡心了。可不是嗎？起初有個呌做阿召的人願意去，我就給他募捐，貼他二十元一月，我說如其還有人去的話，我一凖照數捐給，可是還是没有人去。現在村裹人，也怪不得我鄕長不是了。班長，你給放膽捉去吧。那時候，他們也怨不得我了。不過，不過）鄕長馮文先生說着，也把嘴巴凑到班長耳邊，說了大生先生給他說的那一套。</p>
<p>（那麽好，先讓我們去動手吧。）班長立了起來。心裹透過一條亮，預感到趁錢的機會到了一挺了挺肚，满有精神的說。（得了手，再回來吃午飯不遲哇！）兄弟們，跟我去。</p>
<p>班長揮了揮手，像影子似地貼在壁角的幾個弟兄，此刻才呼岀一口氣來站起。這些黃軍服的兄弟們，正也是不久以前從各村抽去的。他們在聽冬生瘸手報吿時，有的還不住地心酸，在回想起自已老家呢。班長呌他們捉人，他們可提不起精神來。然而他們還是不得不岀去。</p>
<p>大生先生於是也回到自已店裹。又坐在賬桌前搖大腿。</p>

<h3>紗花紗市竟不可收拾</h3>

<h3>糧食粉麥已見回漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、先軟繼昂、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌一元一角左右、坎拿大跌九角左右、當開價時、以國外麥價之連續大跌、將來之傾銷、或者又爲意中之事、是以業内外人心、均感不安、故本月份開價、即因此種關係、重落至二元一角四分七釐半、惟拍至遠期、因各廠方面、交易所實行雙方現金之後、均不願套售、致市塲之賣岀籌碼、無形减少、人心即易受衝動、市面之疲而復挺、大部分原因即爲此故也、迨至下午開盤後、本月份因營口等帮微有現　貨交易、遠期又有新買户陸續收進、各廠抛貨又住不動、故近遠期均見步開步情之勢、惟環境雖已較好、如國外麥價、仍見低落、則後步當有變動之可能也、結果本月份較前日回漲四分十一月份漲六分二釐半、十二月份漲五分二釐半、一月份漲四分半、二月份漲四分七釐半、</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、先跌後穏、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌一元一角左右、坎拿大跌九角左右、當開價時、近遠期市面、曾又一致軟弱、較前日收價落二三四分左右、迨後各盤、則因粉市疲而復佳、故市塲人心、又復穏健、迨至下午開盤、以粉市旣有反振之跡象、且聞銀稅將有實行之傳說、是以人心轉昂、回漲甚烈、查目下市面、雖半係事實上之漲落、惟半則爲投機活躍之所致也、結果本月份較前日漲五分、十一月份漲七分、十二月份漲一角一分、一月份漲九分、二月份漲七分、現麥因各廠依然　住、仍無見交云、</p>

<p>李士廉將嘴一努道··囉！我在咸陽渡口所碰到的，就是他。兩個人於是站定了脚，看他怎麽樣？他那身後，還有兩個婦人，一個是中年的，一個是老年的。只這一層，也是和賈多才所說的相合。他們三人，站在人行道上一棵白楊樹下，對這裹街上來來去去的人，只管呆望着。那個中年婦人說··這地方這樣的繁華，怪不得巧兒爸爸一岀門之後，就不想回家。眞奇怪，這燈怎麽這樣亮呢？那姑娘道··媽，奶奶，你看見没有？那邊一家店，門口都是通亮的玻璃，店裹的東西，外面全可以看得到，花紅栗绿，眞是好看。那中年婦人道··我還看到一家店，樓上又有樓，比佛殿還要高呢，西安眞熱閙。賈多才笑道··老李，你聽到没有？他們倒說這裹是好地方。他口裹說着，横過街來，就走到了他們面前。那女孩子在燈光下首先認識了他，偏了頭只管望着，手却去扯那中年婦人的衣襟，那老年婦人向賈多才道··這位先生也到了，在邠州，多謝你賞我們兩塊錢。賈多才不料他們劈頭一句，就是把自已的黑幕揭穿，不由得臉上一紅道··那也是看着你們說得可憐，我就破費兩塊錢送一送你們。我只要手邊上錢便當，那就常作好事的，所以送你們兩塊錢，我也並不介意，又何必來謝我。那兩個婦人，却不料向人道謝，反是招人家不歡喜，窘得呆呆的站在一邊，却是没有話說。（三三）</p>
<h3>黃蕩河吃茶</h3>
<p>— 靑鬢</p>
<p>黃蕩河够得上偉大的，它名義雖是河··其實有湖的氣槪。簡實和杭州裹西湖相像。所以那河負了相當盛名，它是海寗海鹽的幹流。</p>
<p>慘酷的旱災臨了偉大的河也在災難中涸乾。從前有數丈水位的，現在連河床都見了，天災是多麽刻酷的懲罰！據說··咸豐六年的旱災，在那邊開過茶店，這話語，到現在還留住高年的耳膜。今年那邊鄕民也居然在河邊開茶店了，做一回八十年慘痛的紀念。</p>
<p>（黃蕩河吃茶去）成了市上最有力的話語，無論老的少的，成了玩的中心。小市民總是好睱，在災難中仍不能忘情於娱樂。所以茶客也閙得很。我也受些過份的引誘，約了朋友同去。路程約八九里，可以步行，但是他嫌乏力，於是雇小舟。乘小舟本來最受窘的，河　　得幾寸，推進十分不易··而太陽又熱得很，灼得感着頭痛。但是回想我們還是幸運的，兩旁田岸有不少農人在戽水，在這麽熱的太陽下，那眞是辛苦。漫長的河岸有不少田畝，但是車水用器，僅見一架機器。農事上的設備，乃何等貧乏。看到了事實，設備和天災，都有切膚的維繫。</p>
<p>到黃蕩河，人已擠满了。茶店設在河邊，中央祇剩小小的泥溝。各種小食在從不見於鄕村的，現在也居然在此設攤。每個人都在看河談旱。在許多茶客中，有位九十六歲的鄕老。他說··</p>
<p>（咸豐六年在此開店，僅三天，就傾盆大雨，河水漲满。今年開了十一天，正不過絲絲雨。）他話語似乎下雨與開茶店有相當的關係，鄕老娓娓健談，引起了每個人的注意。河邊有座長山橋，有二十七個僑孔，雖没有寳帶橋的雄偉，不過在浙西，亦是少見的。本來預備再去看看涸萎的田畝，但是烏雲高掛在天際，於是怱怱趕道，途上風緊得很，隨風起落的水波，隨時可見河底。風愈吹愈緊，雲愈黑愈低，在船中，眞担心到急風驟雨的來臨。</p>
<h3>滴點</h3>
<p>— （怡怡館主）</p>
<p>星星之火，可以燎原。涓涓不塞，可成江河。要知道，（星星，）就是（點。）（涓涓，）便是（滴。）這樣看來，天地雖大，實嘸啥稀奇。（點滴）（含意雙關）雖微，倒不可忽視！</p>
<p>今夏入梅，一點雨水都　不滴，以致各處都在閙旱荒！而入秋以來，點點滴滴個不停，大家又在那裹詛咒！於此，可見做（點滴）（含意雙關），也不容易！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其時那一位宮中僅有的植物學專有，差不多整天不能休息，老是站在太后的前面，等候伊詢問，因爲這一段路綫的雨，已很少市鎭，十九是花草叢生的田野，太后看得非常的高興，於是伊的問題，也就源源不絶的發岀來了。</p>
<p>途中，不知道在什麽地方附近，我們經過了一條水色明淨如鏡，也没有什麽大波浪的長河。在平常日子，這裹也許是一處很衝要的水道，但在這時候，却靜悄悄地的不見有一條船舶，因爲這條水流的地位，和太后此刻所經行的路軌相離得太近了，爲求防護的周密起見，已暫時施行了斷絶交通的禁令。不過河的本身，却並不因無船隻往來而减色！太后看見了它，便十分的歡喜。的確，在廣闊的田野中，有這樣一條緑水點綴着，眞像是一幅絶妙的風景畫。但依我仔細觀察起來，這條河原來未必如此動人，一定在先期已有人前來整理過了，尤其難得的是兩岸的樹木。（一四三）</p>
<h3>田野之欣賞</h3>
<h3>談捲烟</h3>
<p>— 沙鷗</p>
<p>據實業部最近發表全國捲烟消費歲耗四萬萬元。這的確是一個驚人的數量。顺便抽起申報年鑑來在財政項下一看，知道這個數目比起目下全國敎育文化一年的經常費總數，要大過二十三倍有餘。若是全國吸慣紙烟的人一齊丢下半段的香烟屁股，也就差不多足供全國海陸空軍一年的經常費而有餘。換個用途，也足够添購四千架和（天廚號）一樣大的飛機。</p>
<p>烟，自捲烟以至於鴉片。論其實際效用，旣不能療飢，復不足以解渴··冬不能藉以消寒，夏不能賴以袪暑。確實在不必需要的消費之列。然而當世正不乏烟的擁護者，他們頗有些哲學的見地，把烟當作和菽粟水火一樣的列入人生不可一日缺的必需品之列。以爲烟之爲用··倦時可以提神··怒時可以平氣··飯後可以解結··便時可以辟穢。文人可賴以助長文思··工人可以忙裹偷閒，奉旨稍息。應酬塲中可於寒暄之後，緊接著藉此君介紹而通欵曲。······在吸著的一刹那間。口腔鼻管裹居然會歔氣成雲，眼底下更可以睥睨一切。一枝烟可以使樽爼間釋嫌修好，寃親平等。可以使失意人消除萬慮，悠然入定。</p>
<p>倘使把捲烟也像鴉片一樣地懸爲厲禁，不但全國財政上經常稅收裹面頓時每年减少了五千萬元的捲烟稅，烟園烟廠裹的成千萬農工頓感失業苦痛。尤其是文化上民衆生活上一個重大的損失呢。這一年間四萬萬元的捲烟消耗還是不值顧恤的。</p>

<h3>四面吹來的煩惱之歌</h3>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>别離</h3>
<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>年紀還是這般靑靑，别的事多得很呢？偏偏不寫，要寫令人氣短的（别離），未免似乎有些太不長進了吧！地球是圓的，（人生何處不相逢）？但是，我又要這樣聊以自解了！人，究竟不是石頭，不是木頭</p>
<p>年來，自從似乎也算閙了一塲失戀的把戲之後，心境，倒反變得安靜得多了！安靜得如古井一般，似乎不會波瀾再起了！朋友，也曾安慰我，呌我不必再牽記着伊，當伊是春天裹一塲夢··當伊是··秋天裹一朶花··好在都是，萍水相逢。我也是如我朋友所說的這樣想着。</p>
<p>（愛情究竟是一樣不可捉摸的東西，惟有友情，是偉大的天長地久的。）當初，我是不相信這句話的，現在，可不知怎的，竟也會不自覺地，默認此語之言之不謬了！奎··是這茫茫宇宙間，我的最友好的知友之一，（得一知已可無恨），現在，這知已是要離别了上海，到他的東方芝加哥的漢口去了！</p>
<p>離别的那天是下着大雨，刮着大風，我陪他走遍了三大公司，走遍了南京路的各大百貨商店，他買了許多吃的，玩的，用的，足足裝满了一網籃，直到晚上十點，才懶散地步上招商局的建國輪</p>
<p>到了輪上，奎對我說··（時間不早了！今天你已很爲我辛苦了！爲了我，你奔跑了一天，到現在脚還没有停，我實在有些過意不去。現在，又煩你一個人送我到船上，眞的還是請你早些回去吧！遲則，電車恐將没有了！）</p>
<p>（這算得什麽呢？）我只說了這一句，涙珠兒險些爬上了我的眼眶。（帮摰友的忙是我應盡的責任，爲摰友而受苦這是雖苦亦所不辭的。爲摰友而受苦的不過是軀體上的，在軀體上受了莫大的痛苦的時光，正是精神上有了莫大的慰安的時候啊！）我腦海裹這樣盤旋着，艙内也頓行沉寂起來了！</p>
<p>（我心裹覺得很難受我們叙會了一年從來没分别過呢？現在可要嘗别離的苦汁了！奎停了好一會，好容易想岀這句話黯然地打破了沉悶的氛圍這樣問我。</p>
<p>（月有陰晴圓缺，人有悲歡離合，）（天下無不散的筳席，）又有什麽辦法呢？我回答他。</p>
<p>我們彼此又沉默下去了！</p>
<p>還是奎，含着淚珠促我走。</p>
<p>我看大勢是不能再有所留戀了！這才拖着沉重的脚步，步上了碼頭。</p>
<p>在碼頭，當我們緊握着分離的手的時光，奎忽然向我說··芥川龍之介不是有這樣一句話嗎？（從戀愛中救岀我們的，與其用理性，毋寗多忙。）我現在僅把它改作（從别離裹救岀我們的，與其用理性，毋寗多忙。）你以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>我點了下頭，道了響（珍重）、直等我倆的影子被岸上矗立着的大洋樓吃没了去的時光，才捧了一顆（黯然的心），在深深夜色裹回到了我的形同古廟的寓所</p>
<p>别離，於今已是一月有餘了！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談動物節</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>本月四日。爲世界動物節。因之中國保護動物會，爲促進社會人士之護生觀念起見。已請准當局。通飭各肉商宰作。禁屠一天。並於是日假座商會。舉行動物節宣傳大會。函請名流指導演講。殿以游藝。其精彩節目。有某女校歌舞，黎錦暉編，黎明健女士演唱之護生歌。他如新聞報，佛月半月刊，護生報等。均發行特刊云。</p>
<p>在這人的生命已賤如狗彘。而且忙人事都忙不過來的年頭。却有不少慈爲懹的人。澤惠及於動物。實爲值得歌頌的事。而且觀其舖張扮演。卽以（婦女節），（兒童節）一等之許多紀念節視之。亦殊有愧色。是眞使人有一（人不如物）之歎也。</p>
<p>世間頗有不少岀神入化，擅長魔術之人。實在手脚高明。嘆爲絶技。希特勒盡力的喊（奬勵生殖）。（消滅生殖機能）。這一方法將人民莫明其妙驅入軍國主義。羅斯佛的藍鷹運動。復興計劃喇叭。將整個社會財產。吹進金融巨頭的袋裹。至於天災人禍人命如蟻螻國裹。在部份人看來。實使人生（不快之感）。怕從血泊中掙起惡魔。不惜以歌舞明星之號召等來提倡（重物命）。好使人安穏的忘去現實環境。忘去這腥風血雨的氣息。</p>
<p>外國名（魔術），中國呌（把戲）。雖說先進落後不同。難道我們這點還不會。</p>
<h3>孩子們</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>踏進了ＸＸ小學的幼稚園，一羣蜜蜂似的孩子們飛撲到我這兒來。他們唏唎嘩啦地嚷着··</p>
<p>（何先生）！（何先生）！把我包圍成一個大圓圈，於是就開始他們原戲法了。</p>
<p>你握着我的手，我握着他的手，他握着他的手，一面跳，一面唱道··（紅了桃花，白了梨花，醉了玫瑰花，前也花，後也花，春光至我家。戴着櫻花，佩着蘭花，拈着海棠花，抱着杏子花，左也花，右也花，春色難描畫！······）</p>
<p>這時，一個孩子絆倒了，他們就嘻嘻哈哈的大笑起來。</p>
<p>我把那個孩子扶將起來，她歪着嘴巴，似乎想哭的樣子對我說··（何先生！你······你没有買糖給我嗎？）</p>
<p>（糖，我也要）！另外一個喊道。（我也要），又另個喊道。（我也要）！他們又重新把我緊緊的包圍起來，有的扯我的衣角，有的抱着我的腿子，有的握着我的手，有的却把手伸進我的衣袋裹去搜索，但是他們，非常失望，其中一個對我說··</p>
<p>（何先生不好！何先生没有給糖我吃。我······我不要和何先生做······做朋友了。）於是就跑開了。</p>
<p>（何先生不好，我······我也不要和何先生好。我去喊李先生買糖去。）於是又跑開了。</p>
<p>（大家去！大家去！何先生没有糖，李先生有糖，大家去！大家去！）於是個一跟着一個都跑開了。</p>
<p>這時我心裹想··孩子是多麽天眞，純潔，無知，可愛的啊！他們生活在一</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>個不受縳束的環境裹，本着人類的天性，他們　　　　就怎樣。他們没有顧慮，没有　　，没有思念。没有被社會上一切惡劣的思想所感染。他們的心是皎潔的，快活的。孩子的生活是多麽幸福啊。</p>
<p>這時，我心裹打動了一下，於是跑進敎室裹去。生活，生活，成年人的生活，機機的生活，漸漸人神經麻木了，對於粉墨生涯，我的心比從前减了不少的興趣了。</p>
<p>這一顆心是用孩子們的心情來療治的，所以我還能勉强的生活下去呢。</p>
<p>站在四週圍坐成一個大圈子的孩子的中央，我拍拍手掌，對他們說道··（小朋友，小朋友，請你們不要氣惱我。慢慢呌買糖給你們吃，喜歡嗎？）</p>
<p>（喜歡）！（喜歡）！無數同樣的聲音連續地喊着。</p>
<p>這時我又想··孩子是容易被人欺騙的，正因爲這一點，孩子是無知，所以更加令人可愛了。於是我又對他們說··（現在先講給你們一個有趣的故事聽聽喜歡嗎？）</p>
<p>（喜歡）！又來了一個同樣的歎呌。</p>
<p>這樣，我就開始講了一段窮人孩子們的生活給他們聽，流浪孩子們的生活給他們聽。</p>
<h3>秋風黄葉圖</h3>
<h3>騎車</h3>
<p>— ＨＹ</p>
<p>在鄕間玩了一個下午，讓汽車　得非常疼痛的頭腦，恢復了原來狀態，精神上覺得很快活。</p>
<p>特别是，和我的朋友騎脚踏車在野地上疾馳着，尤爲增加興趣不少。</p>
<p>說起學騎脚踏車，還是没有脫離學校生活在吳淞時的事情，那時還遠在一二八之前，每天飯後無事，就到車行裹租車，到海邊曠地上學習。一同學車的有章，莎，三個人，現在，時過境遷，人事的變更是難說，我離開學校，在上海過着亭子間的生活，章則因爲受人牽累，至今緊身囹圄，不得自由，莎則回到故鄕父母的跟前去，總也没有信來。這一段不快的回憶，是當我第一脚踏上脚踏車上想起來的。</p>
<p>（你怎樣，想什麽事情？）</p>
<p>我的朋友看到我這情形，問。</p>
<p>（没有什麽，不過想到了二年前吳淞海邊和章，莎學車時的事情。）</p>
<p>（往事不堪回首啊。那時，我們不是都很快活麽，日子過的多麽有味！現在，現在都提不起來了，像我們這般亡省奴，一天到晚除了遭受困苦苟延喘外，什麽希望都不敢想。）</p>
<p>（是的，我也覺着那樣呢。）</p>
<p>只這麽敷衍一句，我們就騎車走了我不願再多說，怕引起他的　　，這對於我們的野遊會生有不快之感的。</p>
<p>太陽在晒着，秋老虎的光炎確是灸人。風在迎頭吹拂着，替我們排去熱汗的蒸發。我們走過些碎石舖成的小路，我們也走過些煤屑路，我們還走些草徑。茅屋，墳丘，田園，河浜，怱怱地迎面跑來，急急地又馳過我們的身後去，它們都變成活動的東西了。</p>
<p>路上，空氣是那樣的清新，嗅不到半點惡臭氣味，看不到飛揚着的灰塵。平靜得很，聽不到吵閙的聲音。鄕間，可愛的鄕間，你比起黑幕重重的都市來，有多麽产超啊！我是鄕間長大的孩子，雖然現在都市中作一條寄生蟲，我無時不在懹念着鄕間的。不分畛域，南方也好，北方也罷，只检是鄕間，總是比都市清靜可愛。</p>
<p>漸漸的，我們騎累了，風也無力吹除身上的熱汗，我們就下了車，坐在路旁的田塍上體息着。</p>
<p>臨近的一家農家門口，一條小白花狗，大槪是看着我們兩個生客不大顺眼吧，汪汪汪地吠　不停，　　　　　　的狗吠聲也跟着　　　　。我的朋友看</p>
<p>（我們走罷，别擾得鷄犬不安的。）</p>
<p>我們又騎上車，慢慢地騎着，走着我們的歸途。</p>
<h3>北平的鴿子</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>在上海，東方一發白，就可聞到從遠遠近近的工廠中送來（呼呼呼······）的汽笛聲。這聲音，是多麽尖利，污濁，一刺入正在甜夢中的人們的耳鼓中來，是多麽討厭的。但是，這是一條鞭子，一聲命令　整天勞作得神疲力倦的數十萬體力勞動者們，是不能有半點兒遲緩和懶慢，而不得不趕快起來動手繼續他們昨天，大咋天，······同樣的工作的。</p>
<p>在帝王之鄕的北平，大約是因要做爲（文化城）的緣故吧，這擾甜夢的怪聲，是永聽不到的。但是，也並不像在人們的想像中的古城那樣的靜寞，一到清早，是也可聞到從遼闊的天空中吹過來的（哇哇哇······）的響聲的。這聲音，在一個初到北平的人聽來，或許也會聯想到汽車笛上去··但，如果他肯躺在綿被裹，張着耳朶，細心地靜聽了幾個清早，他就不會疑心那是做爲鞭子和命令的</p>
<p>如果你能起的絶早，只要徐步行岀清冷的街道上，仰頭當空，就能看見一羣羣白色的鴿子，在遼闊的天際悠閒地翱翔着。牠們在那裹繞着圈子，漸漸地升上去，又漸漸地落下來··清脆嘹喨的（哇哇哇······）的聲浪，也隨着牠們的一升一落，而漸漸地微弱下去，漸漸地響亮起來。細心體味這情景一會兒，許多天來的疑團，這時就能很清楚的得到解　了。</p>
<p>······　　　　　　　，中鴿子着主　一發音器在鴿子的　膀底下，（發音器的樣兒怎樣，我尚不明白。）靠着鴿子拍翼起飛的風力的作用，才發響聲的。這樣一來的唯一目的，只在供給養主聽來玩玩而已。其實，這樣的玩法，想來也是够典雅，聰明的了··不管是早上，是傍晚，一面可以看到在天空中有規律地在兜着圈子翱翔的鴿子，一面可以聽到在耳畔繚繞着的有節奏的音樂，如果以南方許多雅人常在一個小籠中養着來着的小麻雀來　這一比，眞是太那個了。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>（不過你得最道義和團閙一次，八國聯軍打進京，還不够吃虧麽？）老三也有道理。</p>

<p>吃過晚飯之後，桌上也拭乾凈了。時敏跪在桌子旁邊的櫈子上，看着二叔叔從箱子裹拿岀許多梳子，骨針，花粉，頭繩之類的東西來。姑媽站在時敏的身邊也十分高興，她拿着每一朶葱草花，每一根針，都看得非常仔細，而且問清楚了每一樣東西的價錢。大嫂拿着濕手巾來給兒子洗臉的時候，也搬着很大的肚皮在遠遠的看了幾眼，因爲叔嫂之間，不便多說話，所以她很想知道那一朶頂大的牡丹花的價錢，終於没有開口。其後大嫂和妹妹每人都得了一份，每一個人連兩札洋頭繩在内，也有六件之多。時敏也派着了一個頭頸可搖動的泥菩薩和一只小藍子，眞是十分高興，一直到牀還是玩着。只有母親在睡覺的時候在丈夫耳邊輕輕的說··</p>

<h3>Today's Routine Meeting Will Continue Discussions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued deliberating on the draft constitution at 2:00 PM on the 4th. Seventy-three committee members, including Zhu Hezhong, attended. Chairman Sun Ke announced the meeting and began discussing Chapter 4, the Central Government, Section 1, the President, Article 50 and subsequent articles. Article 50: "The President shall take an oath on the day of inauguration. The oath shall be as follows: (I solemnly swear to the people with utmost sincerity that I will faithfully and diligently abide by the Constitution, exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, execute national laws, and safeguard the unity and independence of the Republic of China, so as not to fail the trust of the people. If I violate the law or neglect my duty, I am willing to be punished by national law. I so swear.)" Many committee members advocated for amending the oath and proposed several amendments. The Chairman designated Liang Hancao, Wang Kunlun, and Lou Tongsun to review them first before submitting them to the General Assembly for discussion. Then, they discussed Article 51: "If the President is unable to perform their duties for any reason, the Vice President shall act on their behalf. If both the President and Vice President are unable to perform their duties, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act on their behalf." As a result, the word "and" was deleted from this article, and the rest was passed as originally proposed. Article 52: "The President shall be relieved of their duties on the date of the expiration of their term. If the next President has not yet been elected by the expiry date, or has been elected but has not yet taken office, the duties of the President shall be temporarily assumed by the Premier of the Executive Yuan." Shi Weihuan proposed adding "(both the President and Vice President)" to avoid ambiguity. Shi Shangkuan proposed deleting "(the duties of the President)" and adding "(act on behalf of the President's duties)" to the end of the sentence. The entire assembly had no objection and passed Shi's amendment in the second reading. The article now reads: "The President shall be relieved of their duties on the date of the expiration of their term. If the next President has not yet been elected by the expiry date, or if both the President and Vice President have not yet taken office, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall act on behalf of the President's duties." Article 53: "According to the provisions of the preceding two articles, when the Premier of the Executive Yuan acts on behalf of the President, the term shall not exceed six months." A few committee members believed that if the Premier of the Executive Yuan has been acting on behalf of the President for more than six months and the President and Vice President have not been able to take office, a temporary National Assembly could be convened to elect the President and Vice President. Subsequently, Chuan Bingchang and others explained that it was against prescribing such events in the Constitution, as the organizational law of the National Assembly should have separate provisions. Xi Chaojun proposed deleting the first sentence, and the General Assembly voted, with the majority agreeing to maintain the original proposal and delete the seven characters "(according to the provisions of the preceding two articles)." Then, Article 54 was passed: "The President, except for committing the crime of insurrection or treason, shall not be subject to criminal prosecution unless impeached or dismissed." Chen Ruxuan said that if the President commits the crime of insurrection or treason, how should they be punished? It should be added to the provisions. Lin Bin and Chen Changheng expressed their opposition, and the original proposal was passed. Finally, the presidential oath of office was discussed. Liang Hancao reported on the review process and, based on the opinions of the committee members, drafted a new oath as follows: "(I solemnly swear to the people with utmost sincerity that I will abide by the Constitution, faithfully perform my duties, promote the welfare of the people, and defend the country, so as not to fail the trust of the people. If I violate this oath, I am willing to be severely punished by national law. I so swear.)" The majority expressed agreement with the review proposal and it was passed. Finally, Xi Chaojun suggested that the organizational issues of the Presidential Palace should be expressly stipulated, but Chuan Bingchang and others opposed it, and Xi voluntarily withdrew his intention. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. The routine meeting will continue discussions on the morning of the 5th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan continued to deliberate on the draft Constitution at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. Seventy-three committee members, including Wang Qi, attended. President Sun announced the meeting and began deliberating on Chapter 4, Central Government, Section 1, President, Article 36 ("The President is the head of state and represents the Republic of China externally"). Luo Yunyan said that this article was too brief, as the President is not solely for external affairs but must also have the power to oversee administration internally, as stipulated in Article 44, which states that the President also serves as the head of the Executive Yuan and oversees administrative power. Therefore, he proposed deleting the two characters "(externally)" and completely deleting the wording of Article 44, and adding the characters "(oversees administration)" to this article. Zhang Jihan agreed with Luo's proposal. Zhong Tianxin also said that this article must have a clear stipulation. Cheng Zhongxing, Tao Lüqian, and Feng Zhaoyi advocated maintaining the original proposal, stating that the President is both the head of state, representing the Republic of China externally, and the head of the Executive Yuan, overseeing administrative power internally, and that these should not be confused. If merged, it would feel ambiguous. After discussion, the Chairman submitted Luo's proposal to a vote, but it received few votes. As a result, the original proposal was maintained. Article 37 ("The President promulgates laws and issues orders in accordance with the law and must have the countersignature of the heads of the relevant Yuan"). Wang Yuxiang spoke, believing that the word "(and)" in Article 37 was inappropriate. Shi Weihuan raised a question about this article, saying that if the heads of the relevant Yuan do not countersign when the President promulgates laws and issues orders in accordance with the law, is there a remedy? Luo Ding proposed deleting the eleven characters "(and must have the countersignature of the heads of the relevant Yuan)." Chen Changheng said that our country implements a presidential system, and the heads of each Yuan bear significant responsibility. If laws are promulgated, they should be countersigned by the President of the Legislative Yuan, which would pose no problem. If orders are issued arbitrarily by the President without the countersignature of the heads of the relevant Yuan, it is worth considering. Therefore, he advocated that when the President promulgates laws and issues orders in accordance with the law, they should be countersigned by the heads of the relevant Yuan to prove joint responsibility and prevent any danger. He also proposed changing the word "(and)" in the article to "(but)." Peng Yangguang agreed with Chen's idea. Wei Tingsheng reiterated that the President only oversees administrative power and that not all orders and laws can be promulgated without the countersignature of the heads of the relevant Yuan. If that were the case, wouldn't it be a presidential dictatorship? What would become of the Five-Power Constitution? Lu Zhiyi said that important bills of the Five Yuan must be countersigned by the heads of the relevant Yuan. Zhou Yizhi, Zhang Weihan, and Zhong Tianxin said that they did not oppose the issue of countersignature, but it should be stipulated in the Constitution and can be specified in the future organizational law of the government. After discussion, the Chairman asked the assembly to vote. Out of the seventy-three people present, only twenty-four voted in favor of deleting the wording "(and must have the countersignature of the heads of the relevant Yuan)," and only fourteen voted to change the word "(and)" to "(but)." Because both were a minority of the committee members present, they were not passed. As a result, the original proposal was maintained. Article 38 ("The President commands the national army, navy, and air force in accordance with the law"), Article 39 ("The President exercises the power to declare war, make peace, and conclude treaties in accordance with the law"), and Article 40 ("The President declares martial law and lifts martial law in accordance with the law") were passed without any objections. Article 41 ("The President exercises the power of amnesty, special pardon, commutation, and restoration of rights in accordance with the law"). Chen Ruxuan proposed adding "(but impeachment cases are not included herein)" to the original article to demonstrate the government's determination to punish corruption. Gu Zhenggang expressed opposition, and the Chairman put it to a vote. Of the seventy-three committee members present, four voted in favor. As a result, the original proposal was maintained. Article 42 ("The President appoints and removes civil and military officials in accordance with the law"). Huang Youchang said that the term "civil and military officials" seemed to imply the dismissal of civil and military officials from the past. It would be better to use the term "public officials." Jiao Yitang and Cheng Zhongxing advocated maintaining the original proposal, and as a result, the original proposal was maintained. Article 43 ("The President confers honors in accordance with the law") was passed without any objection. Article 44 ("The President also serves as the head of the Executive Yuan and oversees administrative power"). Lou Tongsun said that the word "(also)" in this article was inappropriate in terms of wording. In fact, the President's responsibilities have been fully expressed in various articles, and it would be acceptable even without this article. Luo Yunyan also advocated deleting this article. Chen Changheng said that this article and Article 47 ("The President is responsible to the National Assembly") could be merged and changed to "(The President oversees administrative power and is responsible to the National Assembly)." Huang Youchang advocated that this article should remain as is. Lu Zhiyi suggested that this article should be amended, either merged with Article 37 or merged with Article 40. Subsequently, Chuan Bingchang explained that the President has two duties, as demonstrated in this article. In addition to the President himself, they also oversee administrative power. If this article is deleted, there may be confusion regarding the President's responsibilities. Zhong Tianxin said that the wording "(President's administrative power)" should be included in Article 36 so that the nature of the President is clear at a glance. Xi Chaojun proposed deleting the six characters "(also serves as the head of the Executive Yuan)" from this article. When put to a vote, forty-two people voted in favor of changing this article to "(The President oversees administrative power)," which was the majority. It passed in the second reading with amendments. Article 45 ("The President may convene a meeting of the heads of the Five Yuan to decide on matters relating to the relationship between the Yuan"). Chuan Bingchang said that the proposal to delete this article was made in the review committee because matters relating to the relationship between the Yuan can be resolved by the Yuan themselves. Li Zhonggong advocated preserving this article. Cheng Zhongxing proposed deleting this article completely. If matters relating to the relationship between the Yuan arise, the President can use their personal power and position to mediate, like the Emperor of England, whose role is to reconcile disputes between the Cabinet and Parliament. Zhou Yizhi and Lu Zhiyi also spoke, also advocating deleting this article. Subsequently, the Chairman submitted it to the General Assembly for a vote. The majority voted in favor of deleting it, and it was decided to delete it. Article 46 ("The President is responsible to the National Assembly") and Article 47 ("Citizens of the Republic of China who have reached the age of forty may be elected as President and Vice President") were passed without any objections. They should be changed to Article 45, Article 46, and Article 47 ("Active military personnel may not be elected as President and Vice President"). Zhu Jingsong said that our country is currently facing internal and external troubles, and the military should be restricted from being elected as President. Liu Guanxun said that the Constitution must meet the requirements of the facts. Our country has experienced more than a decade of internal strife and the tyranny of warlords is unimaginable. Therefore, it should be preserved. Chen Changheng said that we cannot only look at the current situation and advocated deleting this article. Lin Bin advocated deleting the two characters "(active)," but this article should not be deleted. Wu Shangying said that since the Constitution is effective, even if military personnel are elected as President, there are many articles to restrict them. If it is thought to be theoretically untenable or practically impossible, then this article is better off being deleted completely. Lou Tongsun said that what people fear is warlords, not military personnel. If there are truly patriotic military personnel who can take charge of national affairs, the people may well welcome them. Shi Shangkuan proposed a compromise, changing this article to "(Military personnel may not be elected as President and Vice President unless they have resigned from their position)." After discussion, the Chairman asked the General Assembly to vote, first deciding whether this article should be deleted. Only thirty-six people voted in favor of deletion, which was a minority, so it failed to pass. The Chairman then submitted Shi Shangkuan's amendment to a vote, and forty-four people voted in favor, exceeding half. Thus, it passed in the second reading with the amendment. Article 48 ("The election of the President and Vice President shall be determined by law"). Xiao Shuyu spoke, saying that the election of the President should be clearly stipulated in the Constitution, as the President is the head of state and everyone should respect them. All countries' constitutions, except for Turkey's, have provisions for the presidential election law. Therefore, this article should be amended to determine the election law. Zhang Zhihan advocated not stipulating it in the Constitution. Jiao Yitang said that the question of whether the election of the President should be by secret ballot or open ballot is a major issue and should be added to the Constitution. Therefore, he advocated adding the wording "secret ballot" and "the number of people must exceed two-thirds" to this article. Deng Hongye asked to delete the word "(and)" in the article. After the committee members finished speaking one after another, the Chairman asked the General Assembly to vote. Thirty-one people voted in favor of the principle that the Constitution should stipulate the election of the President, which was a minority and failed to pass. As a result, the original proposal was maintained and the word "(and)" was deleted. Article 49 ("The term of office for the President and Vice President shall be four years, and they may be re-elected for one consecutive term"). The Chairman advocated deleting the word "(and)" in this article. There were no objections. Luo Yunyan advocated deleting the two characters "(one term)." Chen Changheng advocated maintaining the original proposal. After the General Assembly voted, the word "(and)" was deleted according to the original proposal, and it was passed. Article 50 ("The President shall take an oath on the day of inauguration. The oath shall be as follows: (I solemnly swear to the people with utmost sincerity that I will faithfully and diligently abide by the Constitution, exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, execute national laws, and safeguard the unity and independence of the Republic of China, so as not to fail the trust of the people. If I violate the law or neglect my duty, I am willing to be punished by national law. I so swear.)" The committee members expressed their opinions on this article one after another. Because the meeting had gone on for too long, the Chairman designated Jiao Yitang to draft an amendment and then submit it to the General Assembly for review. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM and it was decided to continue the meeting at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) He Siyuan, Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Education, arrived in Nanjing to request instructions on how to repair the Confucian Temple. He met with Wang Shijie, Minister of Education, to report on the education situation in Shandong Province and discuss ways to improve secondary vocational teacher training. He then met with President Dai to discuss Shandong Province's plans for repairing the Confucian Temple. According to reports, the Shandong Provincial Government has prepared a budget for repairing the Confucian Temple and the temples of Zhou, Yan, Si, and Meng, and must first raise at least 800,000 yuan before work can begin. The funds raised in the past three years only amount to about 40,000 yuan, and with the central government's allocation of 300,000 yuan, there is still a significant shortfall. The central government believes that moral depravity can only be remedied by honoring Confucius, and has designated the three Yuan Presidents, Wang, Dai, and Ju, and Chief Secretary Ye to review fundraising methods and construction work. They have already held one meeting, and have generally established principles for fundraising. The central government will first allocate 200,000 yuan, and the remaining shortfall will be apportioned by the provinces. I am here to visit the four central committee members Wang, Dai, Ju, and Ye to request instructions on the construction policy, and will return to Jinan in about two or three days.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Sources of Relief for the Flour Industry</h3>
<p>Recently, the newspapers reported on the conversations between Rong Zongjing and Gu Xinyi, magnates of the flour industry. They were deeply pessimistic about the future of the industry, reminding people of the pleas for government relief from the industry in April and May. At that time, the price of flour had fallen below two yuan per bag, the lowest price in years, causing heavy losses for various factories, which led them to appeal to the government for assistance. Later, the price of flour suddenly turned around and rose daily, reaching about 2.80 yuan in mid-August. However, since late August, it has been declining daily again. In recent days, the price drop has been particularly severe, with the price already below 2.20 yuan. Whether it will return to the perilous state of April and May is beyond our ability to predict, but considering the severity of the price drop and the bleak market conditions, we deeply feel that the words of Rong and Gu are not an overestimation.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the flour industry's downturn is actually the loss of the four northeastern provinces. Our country's flour industry has always relied on the Northeast as its outlet. Since the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, import duties on flour have been increased, putting our country's flour industry in a fatal position. The market that originally existed in the Northeast has been gradually occupied by Japanese and Australian foreign flour. Over time, it has led to the situation in April and May. At that time, flour merchants and the government were able to recognize this point, so those seeking relief for the flour industry also focused their efforts on this. However, the flour market suddenly changed, rising rapidly and showing vitality. As a result, all countermeasures were put aside. Little did they know that the sudden surge in flour prices at that time was actually due to speculators seeing the drought in the country and rising grain prices, so they all fueled the flames to seek huge profits. Once the speculative fever subsided, flour prices would fall again. It can be seen that the loss of the Northeast market has dealt a fatal blow to the flour industry. There is little hope for optimism in the future.</p>
<p>According to the latest report from the Dalian Customs, domestic flour imports account for only 5% of the total flour imports. The majority of the market has been occupied by Japanese and Australian flour. If we want to recover the lost territory, we must rely on sufficient military preparation and strength. If we want to recover the lost market, we must rely on the economic power of the country. With some economic power, we can carry out some work. Therefore, if domestic flour wants to compete with Japanese and Australian flour in the Northeast in the future, manufacturers and the government must work together to strengthen the ability to compete economically. Manufacturers should seek to improve the organization of their factories to make their management more scientific. Only with low costs and exquisite products will they have the qualifications to compete. Factories should also seek a joint organization to rationalize production and sales and take a consistent approach to the outside world in order to meet the conditions of commercial warfare. The government should fulfill its natural duty of encouraging and supporting industry, providing appropriate subsidies for exported flour, or refunding all of the consolidated tax already paid on exported flour. (Currently, according to the consolidated tax regulations, half should be refunded.) In this way, the cost of exported flour will be reduced, and it will be possible to compete with Japanese and Australian flour. On the one hand, within our country's domestic market, we should find ways to suppress the import of foreign flour, so that domestic flour is not crowded out by foreign flour, and then domestic flour can stand firm. Considering the mistakes of the silk industry, we are worried about the future of the flour industry. We only hope that manufacturers will quickly cheer themselves up and the government will do its best to assist them, so that the future of the flour industry can be restored to prosperity.</p>
<p>Our Country Submits Three Notes to the United States Regarding the Silver Issue</p>
<h3>The US Draft Reply Is Complete but Has Been Delayed, Two-Pronged Approach Is Being Studied</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States' reply to China's note requesting an early explanation of US silver policy will likely be delayed somewhat. Secretary of State Hull announced today that the reply has been drafted, but because Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji resubmitted a third note yesterday, the reply has been slightly delayed. Hull said that the content of China's third note needs to be studied before it can be released. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull announced today that the United States is currently preparing to reply to China's note regarding its silver policy. China's third note has now been translated into English, but the reply may be delayed slightly as a result. It is understood that officials are now studying how to avoid a financial crisis in China while still implementing the policies stipulated by the previous Congress. A certain source said that a plan is being seriously considered by the government, which is to increase the value of silver held by the Treasury. This would reduce the amount of silver purchased by the Treasury. Most observers believe that this will be implemented, but it has not yet been officially confirmed.

<p>New Lethal Weapon Added, French Army Tests Death Ray</p>
<h3>Emitting Intense Light Rays, Enough to Subdue the Air Force, People Die Instantly Upon Contact</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Associated Press learned today that the French army successfully tested an unprecedented lethal weapon here on Wednesday. This latest weapon was jointly invented by the German Kailaus and the Frenchman Christmas. It is shaped like a cannon and emits extremely strong light rays that can render humans completely incapacitated upon contact. The one tested on Wednesday was a small sample, but experts say it has already met all the conditions claimed by the inventors. Christmas said, "The one being tested now is just a small handgun because it is still in the chemical testing phase. However, based on this test, we can immediately build a giant machine that can emit 5 million candlepower of light. The distance the light can reach depends on the emission power." Christmas believes that a 5 million candlepower cannon can make enemy aircraft completely ineffective, because aircraft pilots will be paralyzed immediately upon contact with this light, and the aircraft will naturally crash. During the test, the muzzle accidentally pointed at a crowd, and the crowd fell to the ground. Many others seemed to be hypnotized and stood still. After the successful test, there was a great sensation here. It is unknown which country the inventors will offer this secret to or whether they will use it as a tool for world peace.

<p>Inadequate Defense and Lagging Navy, Britain Unwilling to Be Bound by Treaty Restraints</p>
<h3>Conservative Party Holds Annual Conference, Lord Lloyd Proposes Motion</h3>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party held a meeting in Bristol today. Former Egyptian Affairs Officer Lord Lloyd proposed a motion, asking the conference to express its serious concern about the inadequacy of imperial defenses. Lord Lloyd said that compared with Asian countries, the position of the British navy is actually inferior, and it is even worse than last year. The restrictions of the London Naval Treaty are of no benefit to Britain. The British people do not want this treaty to bind their right to self-defense. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain replied that the government is well aware of the danger of this situation and has decided to deal with it. Chamberlain also said that the government has tried its best to get other countries to reduce their armaments as Britain has done, but it has not been effective. The reason why the countries have not reduced their armaments is that they fear that other countries may break it. Chamberlain then asked Lord Lloyd to add Churchill's words (the greatest security of Great Britain is higher than all other interests) to his proposal, which made everyone laugh. Lord Lloyd expressed his agreement, and the conference passed the amended resolution. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Labour Party Policy Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>Support for Indian Autonomy Rejected</p>
<p>Secretary May Not Also Be a Member of Parliament</p>
<p>(London) The Labour Party recently held a meeting in Southport. Today, the party's Executive Committee held a meeting. The result further proves that the Labour Party's policy is now adopting a (wait-and-see) attitude. There were two motions from party members put forward to the conference. One required the Executive Committee to clearly support the autonomous government of India. The second required that state insurance be listed as one of the Labour Party's policies. Both were rejected. The Executive Committee members believed that these issues should be closely observed as they evolve, and it seemed too early to adopt a clear political program at this time. The Labour Party then held a conference and discussed the government's (draft law prohibiting incitement to disobedience). This bill stipulates that anyone who engages in anti-King and anti-national propaganda in national military, political, or civil agencies may be subject to serious criminal sanctions. The conference unanimously opposed this law, saying that it obviously carries a sweeping color. The conference then elected the Executive Committee. Sir Cripps, a radical of the Labour Party who was recently described by the conference as having extreme tendencies, was also elected to the Executive Committee this time. Finally, the conference changed to a closed-door meeting. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued, stating that the successor to the party secretary Henderson should not be a member of Parliament and should devote himself to serving the party. (According to a meeting held by the Labour Party branches in Batley and Barrow, suburbs of London, on July 17 this year, Henderson was accused of running for the disarmament conference and neglecting his duties as party secretary. Also, on June 27, Henderson requested to resign from the secretary and serve as a financial officer. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Naval Negotiations to Resume, United States Clarifies Attitude</h3>
<p>Strongly Advocates Maintaining Current Ratios</p>
<p>Opposes Reducing Battleship Tonnage</p>
<p>Washington - Disarmament Conference representative Davis and Chief of Naval Operations Stanley will depart from here on October 10 for London to participate in the preliminary negotiations of the Naval Reduction Conference, and to negotiate with representatives from Britain and Japan. The New York Tribune recently reported that Davis and Stanley will firmly state during the preliminary naval reduction negotiations in London that they will maintain the current 5:5:3 ratio of naval strength of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, and request that the maximum tonnage of battleships be maintained at 35,000 tons (Article 5 of the Washington Naval Treaty). As far as is generally known, the United Kingdom will request that the maximum tonnage of battleships be reduced to 25,000 tons, but this is opposed by the United States, which will not accept even a reduction of 2,000 to 3,000 tons. As for the maximum caliber of battleship guns, the Washington Treaty originally stipulated a limit of 16 inches (Article 6). Now the United Kingdom is requesting that it be reduced to 14 inches. This is approved by the United States. In addition, if Japan requests the abolition of aircraft carriers and bombers, the United States will request the abolition of submarines as a counterbalance. In addition, the maximum caliber of guns on cruisers is stipulated to be 8 inches in the Washington Treaty (Article 10). There are now proposals to reduce it to 6 inches, which is also opposed by the United States. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

(4th Japanese Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before leaving for his post, new Ambassador to Italy Sugimura talked about his ambitions, saying that there are currently no difficult issues between Japan and Italy to worry about. Japan and Italy will be able to agree on their abilities on issues such as disarmament and trade. The Italian navy also does not want to be limited by the existing ratio of naval power. Although Japanese and Italian merchants compete for sales routes in northern Africa and Central Asia, this is competition within third-country markets and is not a problem. The Italian Pope has a great influence on the world. Japan should maintain close relations with the Pope, which will also have various conveniences in foreign relations. After taking office, I am determined to not only befriend Prime Minister Mussolini, but also to liaise with the Pope and work to expand diplomatic relations with Italy.

<h3>Pacific Aviation Route</h3>
<p>Americans Advocate Joint Venture with Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) Legan Burke, the most famous American aviator of the European War, suggested to the Federal Aviation Investigation Committee today that Japan and the United States should jointly operate a trans-Pacific air route for mail and passengers. Burke insisted that the United States should take the initiative first, and Japan would naturally cooperate. He believes that this move can create goodwill between the two countries and can also meet the needs of the times. At present, the aviation industry is greatly affected by political relations, all because of the military importance of aircraft. If politics are eliminated, the aviation industry can advance rapidly. Burke's remarks are in stark contrast to Major General Micheel's statement yesterday that Japan is America's most dangerous enemy. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Austrian Government Publishes Brown Book, Important Historical Materials on Coup</h3>
<p>Proving Germany Was Complicit</p>
<p>Restoration Movement Underway</p>
<p>Vienna - The government published a brown book entitled (Historical Materials on the July 25 Rebellion). Its content describes the terrorist behavior of the Austrian National Socialist Party and how Germany conspired, but does not draw conclusions. However, it stated that since the German law of December 1, 1933, united the National Socialist Party with the state, the actions of the National Socialist Party are the actions of the German government. The brown book then pointed out that the officially published declarations of the German authorities often contradicted the facts. For example, on February 1, 1934, the German government notified the Austrian ambassador to Germany that German radio stations had not carried out any propaganda to instigate anti-Austrian action, and that the rumors were absolutely untrue. In September 1933 and February 1934, the German government denied the existence of Austrian party soldiers within Germany. However, according to the confessions of the escapees of the Austrian party army, Germany had recruited Austrians to organize various party armies and train them. Everyone said almost the same thing. At least it can prove that Germany encouraged the organization of the Austrian party army. The brown book also included various photos to prove this. On the eve of the coup of July 25, 1934, Germany transferred 15,000 people to the German border. Also, the coup of July 25 was prepared in Germany, and the person in command was also in Germany. The outside world knew a thing or two about it. This time, the publication of the brown book specifically contained various documents sufficient to prove this matter. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vienna - Archduke von Hohenberg of the Austrian former imperial family announced at the congress of imperial party that the return of the property of the Austrian royal family Habsburg has been officially initiated after consultation between representatives of the imperial household and the Austrian government. According to the fact that the imperial property was confiscated by the Austrian government after the European War, Archduke von Hohenberg is also a member of the Habsburg royal family, and his father was Archduke Ferdinand, whose assassination was the direct cause of the European War. There is one more thing that can prove the relationship between the Austrian government and the former royal family: at the royal family meeting, Colonel Jimmell, the deputy leader of the Catholic Youth League, personally participated, and Chancellor Schuschnigg is actually the leader of the Catholic Youth League. Jimmell also spoke, vigorously advocating the restoration of the royal family. (3rd National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Romanian Cabinet Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>Parliament Adjourned Until Mid-November</p>
<p>French Newspapers Hope for Reinstatement of Former Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Bucharest - After the establishment of the new cabinet led by Tatarescu, a cabinet meeting was held this afternoon. Prime Minister Tatarescu explained the general situation of the political situation and the cabinet's policy direction. The cabinet meeting then passed several proposals, the most important of which were (1) a proposal to reduce the number of civil servants, and (2) the deadline for the resumption of Parliament, extended to November 15. Before the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Tatarescu met with French Ambassador Thomeresco to explain the cabinet situation. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Public opinion here is unanimously satisfied that the Romanian cabinet can be quickly organized under the leadership of Tatarescu, and hopes that after a short hesitation, the former foreign minister Titulescu can return to the important post of foreign minister. French political circles believe that Titulescu's return as foreign minister is of great significance because Titulescu has the support of the Little Entente and can be the backer of French foreign policy. The Tribune du Peuple's view is that the conspiracy to break the solidarity of the Little Entente has failed, and King Carol's open and fair attitude, his authority and political courage are admirable. Political circles also hope that King Carol can mediate so that the two men can work together again, which is the most urgent task at present. Le Figaro also expressed the same hope and said, (I hope this kind of cooperation can be closer than before, which is what Romania's friendly countries most desire.)

<h3>New Spanish Cabinet Member List</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Radical Party leader and former Prime Minister Lerroux was ordered to form a cabinet. It is heard that the negotiations are going smoothly. Lerroux hopes to present the cabinet list to President Zamora tonight at 10 o'clock, otherwise it will be postponed until tomorrow morning. Reliable sources said in the evening that the important positions in the new cabinet are as follows: Lerroux will serve as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, with General Franco as Deputy Minister of Defense, the Minister of Foreign Affairs will be Luo Jia (former Minister of the Navy), and the Minister of the Interior will still be Alonsa. Other sources say that the cabinet list also includes the following two people: (1) Sambo (former Prime Minister) as Minister of Justice, (2) Te Fo Lasige as Deputy Prime Minister. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Madrid: Radical Party leader Lerroux has now formed a new cabinet, with members from the Catholic Farmers' Party and the Radical Party. Because they have a majority in the parliament, the new government has been able to curb the revolutionary plans of left-wing extremists and take resolute steps to force the Autonomous Region of Catalonia to abide by the constitution and autonomous regulations. The Socialist Party has acted quickly and declared that today's republic is merely a name. Since the Catholic Party took power, the political situation established on April 14, 1931 has been completely destroyed. The new Prime Minister Lerroux submitted the cabinet list to President Zamora for approval this afternoon. Eight members of the new cabinet were members of the previous government.

Although there are various rumors about extremist activities, the overall situation in Spain is stable. In Barcelona, the capital of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, many anarchists and syndicalists have been temporarily detained by the authorities for prevention.

<h3>Rumors in Europe of Tense Italian-Abyssinian Relations</h3>
<p>Italian Statement Denies Rumors</p>
<p>Rome: Foreign newspapers widely reported that relations between Italy and Abyssinia were strained. The Abyssinian Minister to Italy issued an important statement last night denying the matter, saying, "It has even been rumored that Abyssinia is preparing to attack neighboring Italian territories, and that 50,000 Blackshirts are ready to go. As the Abyssinian Minister, I fundamentally believe that this is unfounded. Not only does my country abide by the treaty signed by the two countries in 1928, but it also has no reason to undermine or disrupt the friendly relations between the two countries. I believe that the country spreading this rumor aims to damage the relations between the two countries and reap the benefits. King Tafari of Abyssinia recently purchased the latest military equipment from Europe to replace the outdated military equipment, which is indeed a modern monarch. This may be the reason for the malicious rumors from the outside world. Now, I reaffirm that my King expresses complete sympathy for Prime Minister Mussolini's peaceful policy, and has no intention of inciting hatred between the two countries. Both countries are members of the League of Nations." (National News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>United States and Russia Quickly Seek to Resolve Debt Issues</h3>
<p>Russian Ambassador to Return Home for a Trip</p>
<p>Reporting on the Progress of Negotiations</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia's ambassador to the United States, Troianovsky, will return home for a short stay. It is rumored that he intends to take this opportunity to discuss the debt issue with the domestic government. Informed sources here neither confirmed nor denied this, but said that Troianovsky's return home this time is indeed for official business. It seems that one of the main purposes of Troianovsky's return home is to report to the government on the negotiations between the then Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov's visit to the United States in 1933 and the US State Department in his capacity as ambassador, which is credible. The content of these negotiations includes two issues that Moscow believes are closely related, that is, Russia acknowledges that the old debts to the United States must be granted to Russia by the United States with new loans. The claims of the United States and Russia are generally known to the world as follows: After Litvinov talked with President Roosevelt in Washington at the end of 1933, he declared to the press that the damage caused by the United States and other allies sending troops to Siberia to interfere in Russia's internal affairs in 1918, the Soviet Union will no longer demand compensation from the United States. In addition, other outstanding issues, such as debts and requests made by both parties, both parties also exchanged views in order to find a solution, and to expedite the resolution of various issues that both governments are willing to resolve quickly and satisfactorily. Until April of this year, the US government promulgated the Johnson Act, announcing that the United States is unwilling to lend new loans to debtor countries, but can find ways to resolve old debts, and the methods that the United States can recognize are not subject to this restriction. Then the starting point of the US and Russia on the debt issue has been determined, and it can be regarded as the basis for negotiations that both parties can recognize. Subsequently, when Troianovsky negotiated with the US State Department, he also discussed the details based on this starting point, and a final compromise plan was almost agreed upon. Now, Troianovsky is rushing back to Moscow under such circumstances, and the magnitude of its relationship is conceivable. Other countries that are related to Russia's debts to the United States and can be affected by it will naturally not take Troianovsky's trip lightly. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Eastern Route Army Recovers Zhongwu Village</h3>
<p>Enemy Frontline Has Been Broken Through</p>
<p>Longting Will Fall Soon</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, Jiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Army, issued a general offensive order on the 26th of last month, ordering each army to gradually attack and advance. Zhongwu Village, Dongbai Yiyangling Ridge, and Baxianyan Rock are important passes of Longting. The Red Bandits have built extremely strong defensive works. On the 26th, the Zhixiao Koukou and other divisions carried out strong attacks from Pengkou Wenfang, and the Shi division from Xinquan. At 7:00 AM on the 26th, the Kou division occupied Datou Kengling Baishi west of Wenfang. The casualties of the pseudo-third division were extremely high, and the remaining bandits retreated to Zhuwei Ridge, and were subsequently pursued and occupied by the National Army. On the 27th, Zhixiao, Koukou Kou and other divisions carried out attacks on Zhongwu Village, a key pass of Longting. Kou, commander of the Kou column, personally directed the frontline. Thus, the attack began at 8 AM, and the enemy's position was reached at 9:30 AM, continuing the frontal attack. At the same time, with the help of artillery, the main position of the bandits in the Baiyi Yiyangling area was completely occupied at 11 AM. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, with over a thousand corpses scattered across the field, and over 500 people and weapons captured. The Pseudo 9th Army and Pseudo 24th Division were almost completely annihilated. Zhongwu Village is a small town, located on the western slope of Baiyi, close to the foot of the mountain. With Baiyi Yiyangling Ridge already captured, Zhongwu Village is no longer defensible. On the 28th, the National Army continued to occupy nearby positions, and on the morning of the 29th, attacked Zhongwu Village again, completely occupying Zhongwu Village at 11 AM. The bandits and the headquarters of the bandits' frontline retreated westward, and the National Army continued to pursue, and at 1 PM, recovered the bandits' solid Gao Shan position 10 li west of Zhongwu Village. It was found that the Red Bandits had been tightly blockaded by the National Army, and the interior was collapsing daily. The Red Army decided to defend Longting and Shicheng to protect the old nest of Ruijin. Longting is the most important, because the Longting area is only 80 li from the Red capital. Once Longting falls, Ruijin will not be able to hold. The rear of Shicheng, Ningdu, and Xingguo is already cut off, and they will fall without being attacked. The Gan bandits will also be destroyed. Therefore, the bandits are fighting a last-ditch battle in Longting, gathering the elite of the Red Bandits and building extremely solid fortifications, with Zhongwu Village and Baiyi Yiyangling Ridge as important passes on the front line defending Longting, no less than the gateway to Longting. Hetian is an important pass in the last line of defense, no less than the inner chamber of Longting. Zhongwu Village is 40 li from Pengkou. Once Zhongwu Village falls, the entire front line of the Communist bandits defending Longting will collapse. Going past that is Hetian, 60 li from Zhongwu Village, and 40 li from Longting City, located in the upper reaches of the Ting River, and is the last key pass of Longting. Once Hetian falls, the main chamber of Longting will be lost, and there will be no safe place to defend. The army can drive straight into the city. Therefore, the National Army's capture of Zhongwu can be said to be half the victory over Longting, and capturing Hetian is equivalent to completely capturing Longting. At the same time, the Northern Route Army also launched a general offensive on Shicheng on the 26th. On the mornings of the 26th and 27th, Zhongzi Village, Guling Banshuipo and other places were captured. The bandits suffered more than 3,000 casualties. On the 30th, the main position of the bandits north of Shicheng was recovered. The Pseudo 3rd Army retreated south toward Shicheng. Shicheng is now under the control of our air and artillery forces and can be recovered immediately. Shicheng and Longting are related. If Shicheng falls first, Ninghua will not be able to defend it, and the bandits in Longting will not dare to stay, and recovery will be easier. (1st)</p>
<h3>Overall Investigation of Japanese Control of Financial Institutions in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Indiscriminate Issuance of Counterfeit Currency and Elimination of Old Currency for Manipulation</p>
<p>Forced Exchange of Counterfeit Currency at High Prices Causes Suffering to Farmers</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Miscellaneous Currencies Causes Closure of Money Houses and Banks</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence, Since the Japanese army occupied our Northeast, it has been actively engaged in economic construction and seeking the unification of the currency system, so as to control the full power of the economy. The dozens of currencies circulating in various places in the past will be first investigated by the branches of the Puppet Central Bank, and then withdrawn within a time limit. The details of the indiscriminate issuance of counterfeit currency by the Japanese puppets and the withdrawal of old currencies from various places are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(Strict Deadline for Old Currency Withdrawal) (1) There are three types of banknotes issued by the Guanyin Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, two types of banknotes issued by the Bianye Bank, one type of banknote issued jointly by the Liaoning Four Banks Preparation Treasury, one type of banknotes issued by the Gong Qing Ping City Money House, four types of banknotes issued by Jilin Yongheng Guanyin Bank, and four types of banknotes issued by Heilongjiang Guanyin Bank, totaling 15 types of banknotes in the Northeast in the past. The Japanese calculated from July 1st of the previous year and within a period of two years, according to a certain exchange rate, all of the above banknotes will be withdrawn with counterfeit currency. After the expiration date, they will all be invalid. (2) The old ten-cent copper coins in Liaoning Province will have the same effect as the counterfeit one-cent copper coins within five years from July 1st of the previous year. After the expiration date, they will all be invalid. (3) The amount of Harbin silver dollar notes issued by the China and Jiaotong Banks at the time of the promulgation of the pseudo-law shall be limited. They should be withdrawn within a period of five years from July 1st of the previous year. The above three items are detailed rules in the method of withdrawing old currencies. Regarding Rehe, from March of last year, the Japanese puppets stipulated another method of withdrawing all old currencies, that is, one yuan of counterfeit currency would be exchanged for fifty yuan of old currency from Rehe Province. The merchants and farmers in the province all complained bitterly, because what they had saved in the past were all these old currencies. The Japanese puppets forced them to withdraw them at low prices, which led to the bankruptcy of general merchants and farmers.</p>
<p>(Total Amount of Various Currencies Issued) The various currencies circulating in our Northeast in the past, by the end of the 18th year of the Republic of China, approximately 190 million yuan was issued by our country, and approximately 60 million silver dollars were issued by Japan. By the end of the 19th year, approximately 195 million silver dollars were issued by our country, and approximately 180 million silver dollars were issued by the Puppet Central Bank. Regarding the 15 types of banknotes mentioned in the first type, the exchange rate stipulated by the Puppet Central Bank at the beginning of its establishment was set at 142,223,472 yuan in counterfeit currency. The amount of currency that can be sorted out and exchanged in advance is 142 million yuan. A comparison table of the amount of the above-mentioned 15 old banknotes withdrawn by the Puppet Central Bank since its establishment on July 1st of the previous year is listed as follows: (Unit: Thousands of Yuan)</p>
<p>Period Old Currency Balance Comparison Rate of Recovery</p>
<p>July 1, 21st year 142,235 100 July End, 21st year 131,732 7 December End, 21st year 93,687 34 March End, 22nd year 83,917 40 May End, 22nd year 67,248 53 December End, 22nd year 36,332 74.5 March End, 23rd year Approx. 26,500 82</p>
<p>As shown in the table on the right, the total amount of old currency is 142.22 million yuan. By the end of March of this year, 82% has been recovered, and the remaining amount of old banknotes is 18%, totaling 26.5 million yuan. Among them, there are still 10 million yuan of Harbin silver dollar notes, and the number of 14 other types of banknotes that have been recovered amounts to 16.5 million yuan. For those who continue to recover in the future, it is said that the Puppet Central Banks and Changchun Head Office are busy with the exchange of old currencies, and even work on Sundays. On average, approximately 6 million yuan is exchanged per month. It is thought that the amount will be recovered recently.</p>
<p>(Methods for Recovering Other Miscellaneous Currencies) In Yingkou's financial institutions, the circulation of silver occupies an important position in the market transaction transfer and exchange. However, silver has always been short of funds, so a kind of empty note is issued. (Silver check), this kind of note occupies a particularly important position in currency transactions among Yingkou merchants. In order to sell the conspiracy to unify the currency system, Japan decided to abolish it under the pretext of rectifying silver. On November 4th of last year, a pseudo-order was promulgated to the Yingkou Chamber of Commerce to withdraw each silver. Thus, the special Yingkou silver that has existed for the past 80 years was abolished. The conversion amount for rectification of silver was set at 21.9 million yuan in counterfeit currency. The official recovery rate is 40 cents of silver for one yuan of counterfeit currency, but silver is a kind of non-exchangeable banknote, and in Yingkou's financial world, it has a very deep foundation. Once abolished, Yingkou's financial world will be chaotic. Therefore, the Japanese used the excuse of rescuing the chaotic financial world and established the Yingkou Commercial Bank. The bank's capital is 1 million yuan, and 50,000 shares of 20 yuan each have been fully paid up. It has officially started operations on December 1st of last year. Zhenping silver is a kind of cash silver, which is different from silver. The so-called Zhenping silver is calculated using the Zhenping scale, which is customary in Andong. Only Ma Lu Ti silver that has been appraised and certified by the Andong Public Valuation Bureau (silver appraisal and certification office) can be used in Andong. The current circulation amount is no more than 3 million yuan. Zhenping silver has a very long history, dating back 658 years. It is said to have originated in the 13th year of Zhiyuan in the Yuan Dynasty (1276 AD, the era of Emperor Shizu of the Yuan Dynasty). The Japanese people have now instructed the Puppet Ministry of Finance to announce the abolition of Zhenping silver on April 20th of this year. (1) After October 1st of this year, the transaction of newly made Zhenping silver is prohibited. (2) The Zhenping silver recognized by the public valuer will be bought and sold at a rate of 70 taels and 2 qian per 100 yuan of counterfeit currency until December 31st of this year. (3) The Andong Public Valuation Bureau will be closed on April 30th of this year, that is, according to the notice on the right, the period before September 30th of this year is the preparation period, and October 1st.</p>

<p>After that, the transaction of newly made Zhenping silver was abolished. On the one hand, in order to facilitate the exchange of Zhenping silver for counterfeit currency, it was decided to restrict the closure of the Public Valuation Bureau at the end of April last year, and the Puppet Central Bank would recover it at the exchange rate of 70 taels and 2 qian of Zhenping silver for 100 yuan of counterfeit currency until the end of this year. Although private notes have been mentioned in Yingkou silver, there are also private notes issued by individuals. Especially after the September 18th Incident, various counties issued relief coupons and circulation coupons. For this kind of private note, there was also a temporary method for banning private notes and other similar banknotes and securities promulgated on July 5th of last year. From the perspective of general use, if it has been recognized by the issuing official agency, or recognized by the puppet organization within three months, then the circulation amount limited at that time can still be used as usual for a period of one year. That is to say, in addition to these private notes, there are no private notes that have been officially recognized by the official agency, and all private notes issued by private shops that have not been officially recognized by the official agency, and have been recognized by the official agency as described on the right, since July 5th of last year, because the time limit has expired, all private notes are prohibited from being used.</p>
<p>(Money Merchants Complain Bitterly About Recovering Old Currencies) Among the financial circles in the Northeast, the old banknotes such as Fengtian banknotes, which have the deepest roots, have been replaced by counterfeit currency step by step. At present, only a very small number are circulating. As for circulation coupons and private notes, most of them have been recovered and eliminated. Until June 30th, both the 15 types of old currencies and other private notes are useless. After July, the local tax and off-tax income will be collected in counterfeit currency. Based on the above, the Japanese rectification of the currency work in the Northeast seems to be very smooth on the surface, but it cannot be said that it has a good impact on the financial circles in the Northeast, because the establishment of the currency system is based on the fact that miscellaneous old currencies are the foundation of business. If it is a money house, it will inevitably have to undergo business changes. Money houses have always been financial institutions that general merchants rely on. It is a kind of business that is born from the interest of the change in the value of miscellaneous currencies and the difference in the exchange price between various currencies. That is to say, in addition to the loan business, the money house's main business is the profit from the buying and selling of currencies for general merchants. Therefore, due to the Japanese control of the currency system, this kind of business has been lost. For example, the more than 20 money houses that currently exist in Shenyang have lost the above-mentioned benefits and cannot avoid being hit, or even going bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Ruihua Ship Encounters Wind and Burns on Xiamen Sea</h3>
<p>Dutch Ship Crew Risk Lives to Rescue Crew and Passengers Xiamen Correspondence, Ruihua Ship of Wenzhou Yongyuan Shipping Company, caught fire on the morning of the 29th of last month, at sea 50 to 60 li north of Xiamen. The whole ship was burned. The crew and passengers were rescued by the Zhibade and carried to Xiamen. The details of the incident are recorded as follows: Ruihua Ship loaded several hundred dan of groceries and fir wood from Wenzhou on August 25th, and 7 passengers, and set sail for Zhangpu, southern Fujian. It arrived at the sea off Fuzhou on the 26th, and took shelter in the Ma River due to wind. It set sail south from Fuzhou on the 28th, and arrived at the sea off Beitingshan on the morning of the 29th. A hurricane suddenly broke out. The captain combined full horsepower and proceeded against the wind. Unexpectedly, the steam pipe suddenly exploded, boiler sparks flew, ignited the engine oil, and the dry fir wood piled next to the boiler caught fire, burning the entire ship. The engine was also destroyed and could not move forward. At that time, the wind was strong and the fire was fierce, and there was no way to extinguish it. An emergency radio message was sent. The crew and passengers waited desperately for rescue in the dark night sea, deep water, and raging fire. At that time, Taikoo Jinan, which was sailing from Xiamen to Shanghai, was the first to receive the distress message, and immediately telegraphed various ships at sea, reported the direction, and asked them to go to the rescue. Zhaohua Company's Dutch ship Zhibade sailed south from Shanghai, passing the Fuzhou waters. At about 2:00 AM, it received Jinan's request for help, and immediately opened full horsepower and sailed to the scene of the accident. It arrived first at about 3:00 AM and saw Ruihua burning in a violent storm. It wanted to drive the ship closer, but the huge waves were overwhelming and there was no way to approach. The hurricane was very strong, and it was afraid of colliding with each other. It circled around, helpless. It then agreed to let Jinan act as one side of Ruihua, reducing the hurricane slightly, and Zhibade was responsible for rescue. The owner of Zhibade saw that the fire was urgent, and it was necessary to risk sending a sampan to Ruihua to rescue people. However, in the black sky and huge waves, Ruihua was already on fire, and the situation was extremely dangerous. He had to summon all the employees on the ship and ask who was willing to sacrifice himself for the rescue. At one time, many people raised their arms in response. The owner of the ship selected seven unmarried Chinese crew members, and a Dutch second mate named Folle Lijie, a total of eight people, and the second mate was appointed to lead them. The lifeboat was launched. In the haste, the line of the lifeboat was broken by the wind, and the line was lost in the sea. Fortunately, the people had not yet boarded, and another boat was released. At this time, the Ruihua saw the rescue, and four people boarded the life raft and tried to board the Zhibade. They inquired and learned that there were still 24 crew and passengers waiting for rescue on the ship. So the Dutch second mate and seven Chinese crew members yelled and jumped into the lifeboat and drove away with drum beats. They struggled through the huge waves to the Ruihua and rescued many crew members and passengers in the midst of the raging fire, returning to Zhibade. A total of 28 people including 21 crew members including the captain and 7 passengers were rescued. The relief was renewed. However, there was no way to extinguish the fire on the ship, so it was allowed to burn. After the incident, Jinan sailed to Shanghai, and Zhibade carried the rescued crew and passengers back to Xiamen. Recalling that the fire on Ruihua had reached the mast and was about to sink. Zhibade arrived in Xiamen at 9:00 AM on the 29th. The rescued crew and passengers, including the shipowner Ding Xiangda, crew members Guo Meida, Wang Mingshan, Ying Yongpo, Chi Guanmei, Liao Caiqiu, Yan Awang, Yue Xiaomei, Sheng Laowu, Yu Meimei, Yan A, Kang Laoer, Shen Feibiao, Jin Aqing, Jin Ayu, Li Ruisheng, Hu Azeng, Xie Adi, Chen Changzheng, Qian Yuqing, Dai Xuezeng, and passengers Ke Longshui, Chen Diaohe, Shang Shiyuan, Chen Ganmai, Chen Qishi, Lin Tongchun, and Chen Tonghe, were all sent to inns. The total loss of the ship was estimated at more than 100,000 yuan. (October 1st)</p>
<h3>The Guide-the-Huai-River-into-the-Sea Project to Commence in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Civilians from Each County Must Be Fully Conscripted One and a Half Months Prior</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Bureau Periodically Convenes Meetings of County Magistrates</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) The Jiangsu Construction Bureau's proposal to open up the old Yellow River into the sea has been approved by the Provincial Government and will be implemented by the relevant counties this autumn and winter. The construction survey began in July and is expected to be completed by the end of September. All organizational regulations for the engineering office and section engineering offices will be allocated according to the number of workers recruited in each county, and preparations are being rushed forward. It has been decided that the engineering office will be established in Huaiyin on October 1st, and construction will commence on the 20th of this month. The office has issued separate orders to the magistrates of Huaiyin, Funing, Siyang, Baoying, Xinghua, Taixian, Huaian, Lianshui, Yancheng, Gaoyou, Dongtai, and Jiangdu counties, urging them to quickly prepare the required number of civilian laborers and to ensure that recruitment is completed by October 15th, awaiting the dispatch of the engineering office. Furthermore, a meeting of all county magistrates will be convened in the province on October 16th to discuss the matter. Attached is a proclamation from the Jiangsu Provincial Government as follows: (Proclamation regarding the matter: Upon investigation, the counties north of the Yangtze River in this province have long suffered from floods. Tracing the origins, it is none other than the waters of the Huai, Yun, and Yi rivers encroaching upon each other, with the Huai River being the largest and most damaging. I, as the chairman of Jiangsu, upon assuming office, immediately instructed the Construction Bureau to seek ways to alleviate the situation. Thus, the first step was to conscript labor to dredge the Liutang River to mitigate the Yi River's troubles. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the gentry and the enthusiastic participation of the people, the project was completed in less than half a year, and this year's simultaneous rise in the Yi and Shu rivers was averted. We should remain steadfast in our initial intention and continue the Yi-Shu tail-end engineering project after the autumn to ensure smooth discharge. However, even if the Yi and Shu rivers are managed, the Huai River remains unaddressed, which is not a fundamental solution to the flood problem in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, the initiative to guide the Huai River into the sea by our Jiangsu province is currently the most crucial plan. Because our Jiangsu province is located downstream, and northern Jiangsu bears the brunt of the Huai River, suffering the most severe damage in nine out of ten years, leading to rural bankruptcy, economic exhaustion, displacement, and the breeding of bandits and hidden dangers. If no action is taken now, the consequences will be unimaginable. Moreover, guiding the Huai River into the sea has been a long-awaited aspiration of local people for decades. Drawing on the experience of the Liutang River project, we deeply understand the great righteousness of our people and their ability to contribute. Therefore, the provincial government resolutely decided to adopt the method of conscripting labor to open up the waterway for guiding the Huai River into the sea to eliminate the floods. A large sum of money has been budgeted, and a Guiding the Huai River Engineering Office has been established to take charge of the project, commencing work immediately and dredging in sections, aiming to complete the project in two years. The conscription area excludes the Xu region because it is too far from the construction site, and the counties of Guanyun, Shuyang, and Suqian in the coastal region still need to conscript labor this year to rush the Yi-Shu tail-end engineering project. To conserve the people's strength and facilitate conscription and deployment, it has been decided to only conscript from the twelve closer counties of Siyang, Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Funing, Baoying, Xinghua, Yancheng, Gaoyou, Dongtai, Taixian, and Jiangdu. The slight hardship the people endure while working on the earthworks will be compensated by the engineering office providing food expenses according to regulations, as a token of consideration. All the people of Huaicheng are expected to do their utmost to cooperate. Local gentry, in particular, should promote and lead, assist in the implementation, and refrain from hesitation or complacency. When the dredging is completed and the floods are eliminated, blessings will arrive, transforming the impoverished land into a prosperous region, comparable to the counties south of the Yangtze River. All of this will be achieved and enjoyed by our people. Isn't it wonderful? Therefore, this proclamation is issued for widespread dissemination, and everyone should comply without neglect. This concludes the proclamation.) (Fourth Day)</p>

<h3>Ministry Informs to Stop Intercepting Salt Field Deed Tax</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, based on the report from Song Zian, the Transport Deputy of Songjiang, forwarded by Zhu Xufan, the Director of the Xiasai Tax Office, regarding the Chuansha County intercepting salt field deed tax, requested a formal notification to strictly prohibit it. The Ministry has now informed the Provincial Government, stating that the deed tax of the tidal fields in the Chuansha County map area is collected by the County Finance Bureau, while the deed tax of the salt flats in the group area is collected by the Xiasai field. The areas are clearly divided and the systems are separate. (Omission) It is requested to instruct the Chuansha County Government to follow the instructions to investigate and accurately identify the deed tax that was mistakenly collected previously, allocate it in full, and return it to the Xiasai Tax Office. In the future, each should adhere to its own scope and avoid confusion. A circular should also be sent to Songjiang, Fengxian, Jinshan, Nanhui and other counties to inform them to clarify the boundaries and avoid disputes. It is reported that the County Government has received this order yesterday.</p>
<p>(Wuxi) The Department Entrusted a Thorough Investigation of Disputes Over Tobacco and Alcohol Tax</p>
<p>The Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office in this county is attempting to collect double the tax amount for this autumn, using illegal high-pressure tactics. Merchants, unable to bear the burden, are protesting. The tax office has dispatched a large number of staff to forcibly collect the taxes, disturbing the market. The situation has become serious. The tobacco and alcohol trade associations have appealed to the party authorities for relief. The county chamber of commerce has also forwarded a letter to the county government and the tax collection office, requesting that they consider the merchants' difficulties and continue to collect the taxes according to the original amount. However, the tax collection office insists on collecting double the amount and has petitioned the finance department to order the county to assist in the collection. The finance department, noting that the officials and merchants have conflicting accounts, has sent Dong Zhefu to Wuxi to thoroughly investigate whether the collectors have engaged in illegal coercion, in order to verify the matter. Mr. Huang arrived in Wuxi yesterday and immediately met with County Magistrate Yan to inquire about everything and went to various places to investigate the facts.</p>
<h3>Registration of Opium Smokers Ends</h3>
<p>The deadline for opium smokers in this county to register and apply for quitting opium ended at the end of last month. Each district has now reported the number of licensed opium smokers to the county for compilation. A total of 9,577 licensed opium smokers have been registered.

All public servants in various institutions suspected of smoking opium should be tested every six months and the forms submitted for review.</p>
<h3>Labor Education Experiment Zone Established</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Industry and Education recently designated Wuxi, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Wuchang as labor education experiment zones.

<h3>Wolf Mountain Fireworks Mistaken for Bandit Alarm</h3>
<p>The Nantong County Security Team heard a series of cracking sounds at midnight the day before yesterday.

They did not realize until they were three or five miles from Wolf Mountain that people were worshiping Buddha at Wolf Mountain and setting off a large number of firecrackers, the sound of which carried for more than ten miles, causing confusion. The special office issued an order to the county on the third to prohibit the setting off of firecrackers at night.</p>

<h3>Rain Affects Dredging Project</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu project to dredge the city moat has already begun, with a budget of 4,000 yuan and a deadline for completion to facilitate the Grand Canal. However, the contractor is building dams section by section and hiring workers to bail out water and remove silt and rubble. However, continuous rain has caused water from street gutters to flow into the river, and the bailed-out sections are once again filled with flowing water, even destroying the built earthen dams, resulting in significant labor and financial losses. It is reported that the contractor intends to apply for an extension.</p>
<h3>Brick Bridge Town Requests Police Protection</h3>

<p>(Haimen) No Results from Autumn Survey Meeting</p>
<p>This county has suffered a severe drought since the summer, and the disaster situation is dire. County Magistrate Zhang personally went to various districts to survey the damage, estimating a harvest of 45%. He truthfully reported it to the province and requested that officials be sent to Haimen for a joint survey. The three departments of civil affairs, finance, and construction appointed Ying Cang, Jiang Bairu, and Wang Zhihong as members of the autumn survey committee for this county. They have been surveying various districts with County Magistrate Zhang for several days and have completed their work. Yesterday (2nd) at 2:00 p.m., a meeting of the autumn survey committee was held at the county government. More than a dozen representatives from various agencies and groups, including Liu Xianzhu and Xu Shiru, attended. The three committee members, Ren, Jiang, and Wang, proposed setting the autumn harvest at 60% or above. However, the representatives of various groups argued that after the county government reported the disaster situation, there had been continuous rain in the past month, and the cotton crop had suffered even more damage, with the actual harvest being less than 45%. They insisted on reducing the harvest percentage. The discussion lasted for over an hour and ended without results. According to the three committee members, Ren, Jiang, and Wang, the meeting did not yield any results, so they will report the situation of the survey over the past few days and the determined percentage to the provincial department for review.</p>

<h3>Deng Mingjie, Representative of Liu Xiang in Shanghai, Talks About Sichuan Affairs</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Will Be Able to Resume His Post Soon</p>
<p>Financial Stability in Sichuan</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Deng Mingjie, the representative of Liu Xiang, the Director of Rehabilitation Affairs in Sichuan, at his residence in Shanghai. According to him, since Director Liu resigned, the central authorities have repeatedly telegraphed to comfort him and urge him to resume his post. Director Liu, recognizing the importance of military and political affairs in Sichuan Province, will no longer insist on resigning. The issue of resuming his post is only a matter of time. The generals of various routes in Sichuan have now sent important personnel to Chongqing as representatives to visit Director Liu and discuss the overall plan for suppressing bandits. As for the current financial situation in Sichuan, it is also gradually stabilizing. The soaring exchange rate between Shanghai and Sichuan some time ago was a natural trend and could not be prevented. It has now gradually fallen and is stabilizing. The matter of Yang Can borrowing money from the British has nothing to do with the Sichuan Provincial Government.</p>
<h3>Liji Made a Private Contract</h3>
<p>Wuxue Is Not a Treaty Port</p>
<p>How Could Foreign Ships Be Allowed to Dock Without Authorization?</p>
<p>Officials Investigate Thoroughly, Shipping Companies Strive</p>
<p>Among the Yangtze River routes, foreign merchant ships are more numerous than domestic ships, but they are limited to docking at treaty ports, and are not allowed to operate elsewhere. Wuxue Port is an inland port. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin and other ships are only allowed to anchor in the center of the river when passing through Wuxue, and passengers can only get on and off by ferry, and are not allowed to dock on the shore. However, before January 28, Nissin once set up a barge in Wuxue to stop ships. At that time, shipping companies fought for it, and after negotiations by the Wuhan authorities, Nissin ships removed the barge.</p>
<h3>Privately Sign Contracts</h3>
<p>Along the Wuxue River, various shipping companies have not set up docks, so the setting up of barges is undertaken by Liji Company. There are a total of three, which are specially used for Yangtze River ships to dock for loading and unloading passengers and goods as a business. The barge collects commissions, and ship docking requires additional fees. Recently, the company has privately signed docking and loading contracts for barges with foreign merchant ships. It is heard that British merchants Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Japanese Nissin companies have all signed contracts, which obviously undermines the past practice and hinders navigation rights.</p>
<h3>Official Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Some people have reported to the Construction Department of Hubei Province, requesting a thorough investigation. The Administrative Committee of the Five Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi and Hubei has also received reports that the matter concerns inland navigation rights. At the moment of recovering these rights, how can a private company sign contracts with foreign merchants without authorization? Therefore, the committee has also joined forces with the Hubei Construction Department to thoroughly investigate the origin of the matter. Because the Yangtze River ship of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company docked at the Liji barge when it arrived in Wuxue, the Hubei Construction Department sent a letter to the bureau, requesting it to retrieve the contract it signed and solicit opinions on the case for review.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Strive</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has now copied and submitted the contract signed by Liji Company. Shipping companies in Shanghai also believe that this matter harms sovereignty and that Liji Company should weigh the pros and cons and immediately abolish the contract, and instead invite Chinese Yangtze River ships to dock. If the company's income is insufficient, the Hubei Construction Department will provide a subsidy each year to take into account both business and national rights.</p>
<h3>Eurasia's Giant Aircraft Flies from Lanzhou to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Thereafter, Round Trips Will Occur Every Tuesday and Friday</p>
<p>After deciding to operate the Shanghai-Xinjiang route, Eurasia Aviation Corporation's giant aircraft was scheduled to make its maiden flight from Shanghai to Lanzhou this Tuesday. According to sources from the company, the aircraft is scheduled to return from Lanzhou to Shanghai on Friday (today). Subsequently, round trips will be made every Tuesday and Friday. In the future, depending on business conditions, a decision will be made on deploying the aircraft to other routes. Meng Tiefu, the director of the aviation team who accompanied the aircraft to Lanzhou this time to inspect the Baotou line, which extends the Lanzhou-Ningxia line, originally intended to return to Shanghai today to report on the inspection. If time does not permit, he will postpone his return until next Friday, still on the same aircraft.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Plunge in Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Falling Prices Abroad</p>
<p>Hoarding of Stock in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, flour prices have recently experienced an unprecedented plunge, leading to the Shanghai Flour Exchange's temporary suspension of flour trading to investigate the situation. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned from sources in the grain industry that the reasons for this plunge are twofold: firstly, the price of wheat flour on the international market has been falling more than rising; and secondly, the sale of flour in Shanghai has suddenly been hindered, leading to the hoarding of stock. In addition, the rice market has also seen a gradual decline, and the price fluctuations of rice are closely related to those of miscellaneous grains. When rice prices were high last month, flour prices also rose accordingly. However, with the arrival of new rice on the market recently, rice prices have generally fallen, inevitably affecting flour prices. As a result, some smaller flour mills are in danger of shutting down. How to find ways to provide relief in the future remains to be considered by all parties.</p>
<h3>Dispute at the Great China Rubber Factory Yesterday</h3>
<p>Several Workers and Detectives Injured</p>
<p>Union Director Detained on the Spot</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, a dispute occurred at the Great China Rubber Factory in Xujiahui yesterday afternoon because the factory prevented the Second District Rubber Workers' Union from collecting membership fees at the factory. Several workers and detectives from the French Concession police were injured, and Wang Diansheng, a director of the union, was detained. More than a thousand workers gathered at the municipal Party headquarters to petition for his release, creating a serious situation. An investigation into the circumstances reveals the following:</p>
<p>(Cause of the Labor Dispute) The Great China Rubber Factory was founded by Xue Fugi and others. It is a large-scale factory employing more than 1,600 male and female workers. The factory workers have a long-standing Second District Rubber Workers' Union. Recently, the union sent representatives to the factory to negotiate the procedures for collecting union fees. Dai Youheng, an official from the municipal Party headquarters, was present and an agreement was reached: the union would be allowed to set up a temporary fee collection point on a square table in the factory's garage, for a period of three days. However, yesterday morning, the factory suddenly removed the union's table. After the union negotiated with Xue Fugi, he agreed to allow it to be set up in the afternoon, but only for one day.</p>
<p>(Dispute Erupts) When the union representatives went to collect fees, they were rejected by the factory. The fee collectors entered the factory to collect from the workers. The factory believed this interfered with factory operations and called the French Concession police, who sent a large number of detectives. Seeing the disorder inside the factory, they fired shots into the air to warn against further disturbance, fortunately injuring no one.</p>
<p>(Investigation of Injuries) An investigation by Da Gong News Agency reporters revealed that more than ten workers were injured, including Huang Jinsheng, Yang (surname only), Yang Xiaomei, Zhu Shengbing, Pan Genbao, Zhang Wuchang, Yang Zhengkui, Deng Kaishi, etc. Huang Jinsheng and Yang Xiaomei were more seriously injured and were sent to the hospital for treatment. According to the French Concession police, four detectives were also injured and sent to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road. Wang Diansheng, a director of the union, was arrested and detained on the spot.</p>
<p>(Workers' Petition) Angered by the injuries to many workers and the arrest of the union director, all the workers gathered more than a thousand people and went to the municipal Party headquarters at Fenglin Bridge to petition for a thorough investigation and the release of the arrested director. Zhou Funong and Zhang Sheng, the director of the Civil Movement Section, received them and immediately sent people to the factory to investigate the details. They told the workers to wait patiently for a legal resolution. All the workers gradually dispersed at around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Another Report</h3>
<p>According to Industry News, the Great China Rubber Factory in Xujiahui is a large-scale enterprise. Recently, due to the decline of the rural economy and the economic depression, rubber products have been hit by foreign goods, leading to a mountain of stockpiled goods and sluggish sales. The shareholders decided to gradually reduce the production of slow-selling products in order to maintain the factory. Some workers in the factory expressed dissatisfaction. In addition, some workers in the factory had previously organized the Second District Rubber Workers' Union, which often negotiated with the factory, resulting in many disputes that have not been resolved and have been reported in the news. The day before yesterday, the union sent people to the factory to solicit workers to join the union and collect membership fees. The factory argued that it was during working hours and that the collection of fees in the factory would hinder work. Union officials insisted on collecting the fees. The two sides insisted, making it difficult to resolve the issue. The Municipal Party Headquarters learned of the matter and sent Dai Youheng to the factory to mediate. Dai requested the factory to designate a place for the union to collect fees, which the factory agreed to, stipulating that it would only be for half a day. Thus, the dispute came to an end. However, yesterday morning, union officials entered each department of the factory to solicit members and collect fees. Disputes arose with workers who were unwilling to join or pay fees. At 1:30 PM, two detectives stationed at the factory learned of the matter and went inside to investigate. For some unknown reason, the sound of fighting was suddenly heard. The two detectives were seen running out, hurrying into the office. All the workers in the rubber bottom department of the factory also poured in, chasing after them. At that time, stones and steel shoe lasts were thrown in from outside the windows like raindrops, destroying many items. The factory manager, Xue Fugi, was dragged out by the workers amidst the chaos and was beaten with fists and feet. Fortunately, he was rescued by workers from the coppersmith's workshop and did not suffer serious injuries. When the situation became serious, the French Concession police received a report and first sent two detectives to the factory, who were also beaten. Later, the police sent a large team to suppress the situation and two patrol officers guarding the gate fired two shots into the air, bringing the uproar to an end. In this incident, in addition to the manager Xue Fugi being injured, three detectives from the French Concession police were seriously injured and one was slightly injured. Among the workers who did not participate in the labor unrest, five people, including Wei Yongquan, were beaten. Among the staff, three people, including Yu Xinghao, were injured.</p>
<h3>Director Zhao and Director Shen Return to Province Yesterday After Completing Tasks in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to New Voice News Agency, Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Shen Baixian, Director of the Construction Department, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. A reporter from New Voice News Agency was able to meet with them. According to them, the Jiangsu Provincial Government is issuing bonds worth 20 million yuan, which has been approved by the central government. These bonds are specifically for water conservancy, construction, grain storage, and debt reorganization in Jiangsu Province. The rumors that they came to Shanghai to pledge bonds for taxes are not true. These bonds will be openly purchased by merchants and the public after issuance. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is currently in urgent need of funds, but the provincial government has measures in place to deal with this. They came to Shanghai only to inspect the Farmers Bank. In fact, according to inquiries made by a reporter from New Voice News Agency to banking circles, Zhao and Shen's visit was still to discuss the terms of the bond collateral loan agreement, and results have been achieved. Therefore, Zhao and Shen left the New Asia Hotel at about 2:00 PM yesterday and took the 3:15 train back to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government Sends Agricultural Experts to Shanghai for Inspection</h3>
<p>In order to improve rural planting, the Guangxi Provincial Government has specially sent agricultural experts Wu Mingyang and Huang Ming to the north for inspection. Wu and Huang arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. After a brief rest, they went to various agricultural areas in Suzhou to conduct inspections.</p>
<h3>You Guocai Sends Telegram Expressing Opinions and Volunteers</h3>
<p>Departs for Guiyang to Confer with Wang on Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>According to National News Agency, You Guocai, a division commander from Guizhou, sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, which stated: (Excerpts) "The situation in Guizhou is unfortunate, and opinions diverge. However, when it comes to the communists, everyone hates them. I would not abandon my responsibility, even if internal disputes have not been resolved, nor would I obstruct bandit suppression. 'Fighting against external aggression requires unity.' This ancient teaching is clear. The communist threat is worse than floods or wild beasts. When He Long's bandits first intruded into Guizhou, I immediately ordered General Jiang Pixu and General Che Yuru to join forces with Li Chengzhang, sent by Shao Wu (Wang Jialie), to launch a fierce attack. When I heard that Xiao Ke had arrived in Chenzhou and Yongzhou, I knew that they would attempt to enter Guizhou. For the sake of the province and the overall situation, I telegraphed Shao Wu to take precautions and quickly eliminate He Long's bandits to prevent them from leading Xiao Ke's bandits into the province. Then, I would move the troops suppressing He Long to strictly guard against Xiao Ke. If there were concerns about insufficient troops, my troops could also be deployed and sent into action immediately, regardless of the troops in the northeast region. All of this has been done and the facts are there. Unexpectedly, He Long's bandits have not been eliminated, and Xiao Ke's bandits have already infiltrated from Liping and Jinping. Shao Wu's overall plan has not been announced, and the actions of the various armies are not coordinated, leaving the people in a state of anxiety. Will this disorganized state not lead to our mutual destruction? Therefore, I telegraphed the various armies to explain the advantages and disadvantages, to abandon all claims, and to seek a thorough solution to resist bandits and save the province, to work together for survival. I will go to the province in the coming days to discuss the anti-bandit plan with Shao Wu. Once the general plan is determined, I will lead my troops to the front line. Either the bandits or Guizhou must be eliminated. Heaven is above us, and my determination will not change. I am willing to work with my comrades. However, both Xiao Ke and He Long are long-term bandits. The organizational system of our provincial army is new, and we lack experience. I hope you will not hesitate to provide guidance, and order the anti-bandit troops on the front line to cross borders and pursue them relentlessly, so as not to give the bandits a chance to escape and leave endless disasters for the overall situation. Your great kindness will be limitless. I respectfully express my thoughts and ask for your consideration. You Guocai sincerely requests. In addition, Deng Mingjie from Guizhou received another telegram from You Guocai stating that You had departed from Xingyi for the province on this day and would arrive around the 10th."</p>
<h3>Tea Party of the International Problems Research Association</h3>
<p>Inviting Minister Gu to Speak</p>

Guo Bingwen chaired the meeting and briefly stated that Minister Gu was an honorary director of the association. The purpose of this gathering was twofold: firstly, to express gratitude to Minister Gu for his hard work abroad, and secondly, to ask him to provide guidance on the current international situation for the members' research. The association raised several questions for Minister Gu to answer. The first question was: "What is the attitude of European and American countries towards the Sino-Japanese problem and what are the reasons for it?" Minister Gu gave a full explanation, which took an hour. The remaining questions were not answered because it was too late. It is said that the association plans to invite Minister Gu to speak at the meeting again when he is free.</p>
<h3>Great Northern Telegraph Company Hosts Banquet for Danish-Chinese Study Delegation</h3>

<p>The local Great Northern Telegraph Company recently received a message from Copenhagen stating that Vice Minister of Transportation Yu Feipeng, General Xu Tingyao, and other members of the military and transportation study delegation visited Denmark at the end of August. The delegation left Shanghai in May of this year to study everything in Europe and the United States. When the delegation arrived in Denmark, it conducted on-site investigations into the Danish agricultural cooperative situation. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Agricultural Committee arranged the itinerary to facilitate travel throughout the region. The Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company, which has a long history in China, hosted a luncheon at the Royal Danish Yacht Club, which is located on the coast of Copenhagen and has excellent scenery. At that time, the company also invited Luo Zhongyi, the Chinese Minister to Denmark, and his wife, as well as officials from the Chinese Embassy, to accompany the banquet. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Guo Chengchang Inspects Chinese Ink Industry</h3>
<p>Guo Chengchang, the manager of the Paragon Press in Southeast Asia, returned to China for the first time the day before yesterday to inspect the printing and ink industry in China. After arriving in Shanghai, he first visited the Yonghe Industrial Company's ink factory and found its equipment to be complete and its products to be of high quality. He praised it as the leader in domestic ink products. Last night, Ye Zhongting, the manager of the company, and Qian Mengwei, the director of the ink department, hosted a banquet at Xinghualou to welcome him. They also guided him to visit the various departments of Shen Bao in order to reform the printing industry and promote Chinese culture after returning to Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3>Li Shijia's Illness Not Fully Recovered</h3>
<p>Wang Shouting Temporarily Replaces Ma Jiang Commander</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, Li Shijia, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government and commander of the Ma Jiang Fortress, came to Shanghai for medical treatment. He is gradually recovering, but still needs a long period of recuperation to regain his health. The Navy Department believes that Li has been away from his post for a long time, and the Ma Jiang Fortress is of great importance, so it has specially appointed Wang Shouting, the commander of the training fleet, to temporarily replace him. According to sources in the local naval community, Wang is currently staying in Beijing and is scheduled to take a ship to Fujian to assume his duties in the coming days. As for the report that Chen Shaokuan, the Minister of the Navy Department, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing yesterday morning, it is not true.</p>
<h3>Cheng Haifeng Discusses Factory Inspection</h3>
<p>Implementation in the Concessions Soon</p>
<p>According to New Voice News Agency, Cheng Haifeng, the director or deputy director of the International Labor Bureau, went to the Municipal Council and the Chinese Ratepayers Association yesterday to solicit opinions on the implementation of factory inspections in the Concessions. According to what he told a New Voice News Agency reporter who visited him yesterday morning, yesterday's consultations were only of a consultative nature. The Chinese Ratepayers Association agreed to support the implementation. The Municipal Council, where Li Pingheng attended the International Labor Conference, had previously consulted the British and French governments and achieved satisfactory results, so the Municipal Council also had no objection. However, it seemed that they were concerned that the inspection would involve their administration. In fact, factory inspection is for the safety of our factories and has nothing to do with their administration. This is a very clear fact. Therefore, factory inspections in the Concessions will soon be implemented. In addition, the bureau has not yet received notification of the Soviet Union's accession to the International Labor Organization.</p>
<h3>Lin Biao Comes to Shanghai to Practice Law</h3>

If your association could issue a special notice to your member factories to introduce us, inviting the factories to send personnel to negotiate with us, we will sincerely await your instructions.

If the cooperation plan is implemented, all shipping companies can be expected to develop and compete with shipping companies from various countries.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Requests Cancellation of Sea Food and Grocery Industry's Excise Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Municipal Government yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the request, on the 3rd of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Sea Food and Grocery Industry Association stating that the business nature of the brokers and the association is completely unrelated and that it is impossible to claim broker certificates. We request your review and submission to the Municipal Government for cancellation. The letter from the Hua Jie (Chinese-administered area) members of the association states that during the Republic of China 19, the Shanghai County Excise Tax Collection Office forcibly designated the association's shops as being similar to brokerages because some of them were called 'hang', and required them to pay taxes and obtain licenses. At that time, the shops, not knowing the excise tax regulations, thought that paying taxes was a duty and blindly obtained the licenses. This has continued for four years. Recently, upon seeing the announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's standardization of excise tax and revision of new rules, they learned the excise tax regulations and nature in detail and realized that they are completely unrelated to the association's shops. The business of brokerages is to mediate between buyers and sellers, and they only take commissions after a transaction. They have little capital and no responsibility for profits or losses. The business of the association's shops is to use considerable capital to purchase Chinese and foreign sea food and groceries and wholesale them to various shops. They are wholesalers and bear the responsibility for profits and losses. They do not receive commissions, and their business is completely unrelated to the nature of mediation. Furthermore, Article 3 of the brokerage business regulations states that: 'Those who apply for a brokerage registration certificate must state the following items (six items) in the application and attach a brief description of the brokerage's organization and tasks, which will be approved by the Finance Bureau before issuing the certificate for business.' The association's shops cannot fill in the form at all, and there is no way to draft the task description. (Omitted) The association's members use considerable capital to transport and sell Chinese and foreign sea food and groceries as their business, which is completely unrelated to the nature of brokerages whose purpose is to take commissions. (Omitted) The shops previously mistakenly recognized the excise tax that they should not have paid because they were not familiar with the brokerage regulations. Now that the Municipal Finance Bureau is rectifying the excise tax and revising the new rules, the error of the association's members, who should not have borne the excise tax, should be corrected and cancelled. We request that you forward the matter to the Municipal Government for review and promptly order cancellation to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and ensure fairness. To the association, it is believed that the members are suffering difficulties." (Omitted) Based on this, according to Article 1 of the Shanghai Municipal Brokerage Business Regulations recently announced by the Municipal Government, "This regulation refers to brokerages as those who sell on behalf of customers and collect commissions as their business." According to this definition, those who pay the excise tax should be limited to those who specialize in taking commissions from middlemen. The sea food and grocery industry uses considerable capital to open shops, purchase Chinese and foreign goods, and wholesale or retail them to shops or customers. They themselves bear the responsibility for profits and losses. Their business is completely different from that of middlemen who specialize in taking commissions. According to the provisions of Article 1 of the above-mentioned Brokerage Business Regulations, they have no obligation to apply for brokerage certificates. We should forward the matter based on the facts and request the Municipal Government to review and grant an order to the Finance Bureau to remove the excise tax for the sea food and grocery industry to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and ensure fairness.</p>

<h3>Origin of the Moving Circular White Light in the Sky Last Night</h3>
<p>Reflection Lights Tested for the First Time at the New Bank Building</p>
<p>At about 7:00 PM last night, a circular white light suddenly appeared in the sky, circling from south to east to north to west. Those who saw it at the time were puzzled and regarded it as a spectacle. Later, after a reporter climbed to the top floor of this newspaper office and looked around, he realized that the light originated from the rooftop of the 24-story building of the Fourth Banks Joint Savings Society's new building on Jingan Temple Road. The tip of the building's rooftop is equipped with a rotating reflector light. Last night was the first test of the new light. It happened that there were dense clouds in the sky, resulting in this shape. A sudden glimpse of it might seem amazing, so it is recorded to inform those who have doubts.</p>
<h3>All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Telegram to Haining and Other Counties to Investigate the Disaster</h3>
<p>Determine the Number of Congee Kitchens Based on the Severity of the Disaster</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Meeting to be Held Tomorrow to Approve Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram to 54 counties including Haining, Haiyan, Tongxiang, Chongde, Yiwu, Lanxi, Shaoxing, Nantian, Zhuji, and Jinhua in the disaster-stricken areas, requesting the respective county governments to investigate the disaster situation in their jurisdictions in order to determine the number of congee kitchens to be set up based on the severity of the disaster. The original telegram is excerpted as follows (titles omitted): This year, rainfall has been delayed, and the drought demon has wreaked havoc. Zhejiang is the most severely affected, and the affected area is also the largest in Zhejiang. My colleagues and I are deeply saddened and have formed this association to appeal and seek relief. However, the severity of the disaster in each area needs to be investigated clearly before rescue can be planned. A survey form is specially drafted and telegraphed to your government, requesting you to quickly send to this association the most severely affected and next most severely affected areas, villages, and the number of people awaiting relief in your jurisdiction, one by one in detail and truthfully, so that we can handle it. In addition, the association has raised 100,000 yuan through donations during the last meeting for the purpose of raising funds for emergency relief. It is scheduled to convene the first Supervisory Committee meeting at 4 p.m. tomorrow in the meeting room of the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road to approve the distribution plan and carry out emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Hubei Fellow Association's Declaration on Raising Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Hubei Fellow Association in Shanghai's Committee for Raising Funds for Water and Drought Disaster Relief in Hubei Province issued a declaration, saying that after the floods and red disasters in Hubei Province, people's livelihood has been depleted and is on the verge of crisis. Coupled with national disasters, the pain is even deeper. Before we can catch our breath, the wounds are worsening. Now, heaven does not tire of chaos, and water and drought occur repeatedly. In 14 counties including Mianyang, Hanchuan, Tianmen, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, Jiangling, Guangji, Chongyang, Tongcheng, Yunmeng, Lishan, Xiangyang, Yunxian, and Jianshi, mountain torrents broke out, river embankments collapsed, houses and crops were flooded, and countless people and livestock were drowned. In 31 counties including Huanggang, Macheng, Huang'an, Huangmei, Puqi, Xishui, Wuchang, Hanyang, Yangxin, Luotian, Gong'an, Yicheng, Xianning, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Tongshan, Jiayu, Yingshan, Qichun, Daye, Anlu, Echeng, Yingcheng, Jingshan, Jingmen, Zhuxi, Zhijiang, Yidu, Shishou, and Jianli, there has been no rain for months, the fields are dry and cracked, the seedlings are withered and dead, and livelihoods are cut off. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented, and the scope of the disaster covers almost the entire province. People supporting the old and carrying the young are begging for food in the major cities and towns of Wuhan. They are haggard and emaciated, and the sight is unbearable. This association, upholding the righteousness of officials and feeling the pain deeply, cannot but cry out to the people of the country. We believe that rescuing disasters is like fighting fire. A little delay will lead to a prairie fire. Preventing chaos should be done before it happens, and preparedness can prevent trouble. The people of central Hubei have long been suffering from hunger, cold, and war. Recently, they have been in deep water and scorching heat. If we do not seek relief early, then the situation will inevitably lead to the tragedy of displacement. We will see the good and weak turn into ditches and ravines, and the strong will take risks. This is not only a concern for one province, but affects everyone. The matter depends on the efforts of all. We hope that benevolent people, elders, public and private legal entities will be concerned about these disaster victims, open their wallets and provide assistance. What can be pre-announced is that the relief funds will not involve waste. All income and expenditure will be publicly reported. As long as we can save one life, we will protect one point of peace for society and leave one point of vitality for the country. Heaven and earth will see this sincerity. We are extremely urgent and pray to the utmost. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association Plans to Provide Emergency Relief to Haining County, Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association believes that since the beginning of summer, Haining County, Zhejiang, has experienced an unusual drought with no rain, and half of the crops have failed. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented, and there are more than 300,000 disaster victims. The tragedy of selling wives and children cannot be fully described. The county is divided into five districts, all of which are severely affected. The association has sent members to investigate and report that the area has been affected by the sluggish sales of silk cocoons, coupled with the ravages of the drought demon, and the situation is extremely tragic. The association heard that the people's markets were depressed and the sources of relief funds were extremely scarce, and planned to reluctantly undertake a portion of the emergency relief. It has publicly elected an officer to go to handle it immediately. However, the north wind is howling and winter is cold, and the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold. Their livelihoods cannot last. We hope that benevolent people at home and abroad, at this time of great calamity, will save people as saving themselves and generously donate to save the remaining people, creating immeasurable blessings.</p>
<h3>Meeting Minutes of the South District Rent Reduction Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee held a regular meeting yesterday at the auditorium of the association in Yongqingli, Minguo Road. Song Yuntao chaired the meeting, and Ni Yiduo recorded it. After performing the rituals, the following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the case reported by the representative of Yuyuanli that the Fifth District, First Precinct of the Public Security Bureau collected rent without issuing receipts or housing tickets, it was resolved that the Public Security Bureau should be urged to issue housing tickets or receipts. (2) Regarding the case that the City Council sent a letter to the association requesting assistance for the public service personnel of Dangyueli who were watering manure buckets, it was resolved that the association should provide material assistance to Changyueli. However, the landlord using the law as a symbol and the tenant using resistance are not good strategies for the current situation. We advise landlords and tenants in the Mu area not to take such actions. (3) Regarding the case that the Fang branch had sent letters to the landlord to request rent reduction for more than a month without receiving a reply, it was resolved that if the landlord does not reply after receiving the letter, it will be regarded as tacit consent to the rent, which will be temporarily deposited in the bank. When the landlord collects the rent, it will be paid at a 30% discount. As for the small rent portion, the landlord will be asked to return it according to the law to avoid hurting feelings. (4) It was resolved that the constitution and signs of each rent reduction branch legally organized will only be issued after they have been received. Those without credentials issued by the association or those who forge them are not branches of the association. Members may report to the association and request the Party and government organs to ban them. (5) It was resolved that the association will hold a regular meeting every Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m. and will no longer send letters of notification. (6) Regarding the case that each branch reported that the landlord had been delaying the resolution and the tenants were depositing the rent reduction in the rent reduction association on a monthly basis, which was equivalent to the landlord's rent collection agency, it was resolved that if the association sends a letter to the landlord and the matter is not resolved or ignored within three months, the rent will be paid at a 30% discount according to the Hangzhou reduction method after three months. If the landlord does not accept it, it will be deposited in the bank. (7) Regarding the request for rent reduction from the sellers of new buildings on the Bund, etc., after mediation by the association's member Ni, it was decided that since the landlord is a sublessor and has no profit-making nature, and Miao accepts the rent reduction, please consider and decide on a public resolution. It was resolved that the rent should be reduced by five yuan per month. (8) It was resolved that the representative of the Lindeli branch, together with the association's member Xin Fu, negotiated rent reduction with the landlord Lie Ji. The landlord requested a slight reduction because the interest was meager, it was resolved that the matter should be resolved with an 80% solution. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>The Booming Business of Ningbo Industrial Bank After Moving into its New Building</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Industrial Bank, due to the expansion of its business, moved into its new building address on Nanjing Road for business on October 1. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now reported that since the opening of the new building address, the daily transactions, mortgage loans, and various deposits have been extremely crowded. The staff's response is very thoughtful, which proves that the bank's business management has penetrated the hearts of the people and is a bank that truly serves the society. The bank's main business purpose is to assist industry. In view of the backwardness of production in our country and the lack of economic support, since its establishment, it has taken the adjustment of the economic situation in the industrial sector as its primary mission, such as handling factory goods mortgage loans, national product circulation mortgage loans, etc., to promote industrial development and fulfill its responsibilities. Currently, the bank has specially opened a national product market on the second floor of the building, and more than 500 national product factories have joined, which will cooperate with the production and sales of Chinese national products. The bank's branches in various ports take into account the local industrial and commercial interests in their business objectives. For example, the Suzhou branch handles free remittance services for fellow Ningbo villagers traveling to Suzhou and the handover of funds for various industrial and commercial groups in Suzhou and Shanghai. The Kunshan branch has specially set up a farmers' mortgage warehouse, specializing in cotton, grain, and rice mortgage loans. The Shenjiamen branch actively handles loan services for fishermen's warehouses and small loans for the fishing industry. The Ningbo branch develops various local industrial and commercial businesses. The bank has been established for three years, so it has considerable reputation in Suzhou, Shanghai, Ningbo, Kunshan, Shenjiamen and other places. It is reported that the bank's future direction of development is to break the old concepts of the banking industry and strive for economic cooperation with the people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Denounces Free-Loading Han</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi News yesterday, police from the Japanese Consulate stated that Japanese expatriates often indulge in excessive drinking and become unsightly, which is not only despised by foreigners but also greatly damages the dignity of the Japanese people. Despite repeated admonitions, offenders continue to emerge. On the evening of the 3rd, a man named Yasumi Koiyama, residing on the upper floor of a foreign firm at No. 28 Mallison Road, along with two or three friends, went to Yili Restaurant on Wuchang Road and Dayang Cafe on Haining Road for excessive drinking. Then they went to Dotonbori Cafe on Haining Road and spent 12 yuan. After drinking, they left without paying a penny. The cafe notified the Consulate Police Station, which arrested them. After they sobered up, they agreed to pay the bill on the evening of the 5th, and then they were released. The free-loading Han was severely reprimanded for tarnishing the dignity of the Japanese expatriates and ordered to go home.</p>

<h3>Mediation Yesterday on the Dispute Over Demolition in Leyi Lane, French Concession</h3>
<p>Mediation by the Municipal Review Council Yesterday</p>
<p>Water Cutoff Caused Panic</p>
<p>The case of the houses in Leyi Lane, Anjin Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, where the owner Jiang Hanqi notified the tenants of a rent increase which was not accepted, and demolished the houses for reconstruction, causing the tenants to oppose it, has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the Shanghai Municipal Review Council for Rent Disputes summoned both parties for mediation yesterday. The owner cut off the water supply, and the court is scheduled to open the trial today. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>(Mediation by the Municipal Review Council) The Shanghai Municipal Review Council for Rent Disputes, upon receiving the case submitted by the tenants of Leyi Lane requesting relief from the Municipal Government, summoned both parties for mediation at 2 p.m. yesterday. The tenant representatives Wang Dekui, Li Yuting, Tang Shishan, Xu Yuchang, etc., and the owner's representative, lawyer Zhu Yisheng, arrived. The chairman of the council, Chen Lengseng, first inquired about the opinions of the tenant representatives. The representatives Wang Dekui, etc., detailed the owner's failure to increase the rent, the demolition of houses for reconstruction, and the construction of fences. After inquiring about the opinions of the owner's representative, he advocated that the interests of both parties should be taken into account, and persuaded the owner to make concessions and settle out of court as much as possible. He then reported the results to cancel the case. At that time, both parties expressed their approval and withdrew. The tenant side has now sent a letter to the owner's representative, lawyer Zhu, requesting to arrange a date to start negotiations.</p>
<p>(Water Cutoff Caused Panic) After the owner of the lane failed to build the fence, he took the second step of coercion and persuasion, and suddenly cut off the tap water that all the tenants in the lane drank every day at around 6 p.m. yesterday. All the tenants panicked for a while. They believed that the owner had already been advised by the Municipal Review Council to mediate and expressed his approval. On the one hand, he actively carried out the demolition of houses and stopped the water supply, indicating that he had no sincerity in mediation. Therefore, the tenants decided to hire a lawyer to proceed according to the law, in addition to trying to connect the tap water to meet their needs.</p>
<p>(Court to Open Trial Today) The tenants believe that the owner went back on his word, having notified the tenants of a rent increase and a grace period for reconstruction, and suddenly demolished the houses on the pretext that they were dangerous. In addition to unanimously opposing it, they specially filed a petition with the Shanghai Second Special District Court a few days ago, requesting the court to stop the water cut, fence construction, and demolition of houses, and to grant a temporary injunction. After receiving the petition, the court has scheduled a hearing for both parties in the Fourth Tribunal at 2 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Three Russian Dancers Wandering Homelessly Deported from Ningbo to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Without Passports, Not in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>Kaili Zhujin, a Russian dancer from this city, is 20 years old. She, her mother, Cai Mu, and another dancer, Saimu, performed song and dance at the Taotao Grand Theater in Nanjing. Recently, due to unemployment and difficult living conditions, they took a steamer from Shanghai to Ningbo yesterday morning, intending to find a dancing job in Ningbo. However, after arriving in Ningbo, they learned that there were no dance halls in Ningbo, so they were greatly disappointed. In addition, their funds were exhausted and they could not return. They asked the Yinxian government for relief. The Yinxian government then informed the Fourth Public Security Bureau on the north bank of Jiangbei to investigate. The Russian women had no passports, which was not in accordance with the regulations. They were deported to Shanghai on the Ning Shao Lun at 4 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Women and Children's Hospital Case</h3>
<p>Li Wangshi, also known as Wang Zhifen, the wife of Li Shilin, a local who opened the Huadong Construction Engineering Company at No. 34 Shangxianfang, Xiafei Road, French Concession, opened Huadong Architectural Engineering Company on Beijing Road, was sent to the Shangxian Tang Women and Children's Obstetrics Hospital at No. 1 Sapo Road on the morning of June 29 this year due to her seventh full-term pregnancy. After giving birth, she suddenly suffered from puerperal fever and was carried back to her home, where she died on July 12 after unsuccessful medical treatment. Li Shilin believes that his wife's illness started after giving birth in the hospital, and the hospital did not provide appropriate treatment. Therefore, he believes that the hospital's director, Dr. Zhang Xiangwen, Ge Chenghui, and the head nurse, Gu Qinwang, are responsible for negligence that resulted in death. He then hired lawyers Yan Yinwu and Lu Congzu as agents and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Zhang Xiangwen, Ge Chenghui, and Gu Qinyu of negligence that resulted in death and requesting that they be investigated according to the law. This case has been investigated by the Criminal Division Chief Wang Gangxu twice, who summoned both parties and witnesses Chen Jingxu and Diao Xinde, two doctors, to investigate the details. This has been reported in previous newspapers. The court has sent a letter to the Chinese Medical Association for appraisal and has received a reply from the association. Yesterday afternoon was another scheduled hearing. Both parties arrived at the court on time with their lawyers. At 3 o'clock, Court Chief Wang opened the Criminal Second Division to hear the case and summoned the plaintiff and defendants to the court. After briefly questioning their names and ages, the court issued the Chinese Medical Association's reply to both lawyers for review and questioned the plaintiff Li Shilin about his visits to the hospital after his wife gave birth and the process of discovering her illness. The defendants Zhang Xiangwen, Ge Chenghui, and Gu Qinyu were questioned about the process of examining the patient Wang. The information provided by both parties was about the changes in the illness and the level of fever, which was the same as the situation recorded in the previous newspapers. There is no need to record it again. After the questioning was over, when the official ordered the debate to begin, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the Chinese Medical Association's reply was ambiguous and was not signed by a standing committee member or a responsible person. It was answered by a secretary, He Wenbin, which was difficult to believe. It would be best to request the court to send it to a fair medical institution for another appraisal, such as the forensic doctor research and appraisal established by the Ministry of Justice, in order to seek a fair judgment for both parties. After speaking, he presented a copy of the table of the patient's illness, medication, and treatment to the court. Then, the defendant's defense lawyer, Yi Yigong, expressed his opinion. As a result, the court granted the request and ordered a hearing to be scheduled at a later date. The court was adjourned. Since the occurrence of this case, it has attracted considerable attention in the society. Therefore, the audience was very crowded during the previous two court hearings, and the parties involved on both sides still came to the court yesterday. The number of listeners was very large, especially women, making the narrow court extremely crowded.</p>
<h3>Driver's Association Rescues the Owner of the Baohua Steamer</h3>
<p>The Baohua Steamer Left Qidong Yesterday and Arrived in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Dabai News Agency reported that the Baohua Steamer of the Ping'an Steamer Company in this city, after being detained by the Qidong County Government, has been released and sailed from Qidong and arrived in Shanghai at 3 a.m. this morning with the assistance and negotiations of various shipping groups. However, the shipowner, Wang Yunfa, has not been released due to the lawsuit filed by the families of the drowned passengers. The China Driver's Association in this city held an emergency meeting at its meeting place at 9 a.m. yesterday and issued a declaration requesting assistance from all walks of life. The excerpt is as follows: It briefly stated that Wang Yunfa, the owner of the Ping'an Company's Baohua Steamer and a member of the association, was driving from Shanghai to Qidong County on the 12th of last month when he encountered wind, waves, rain, and fog, and ran aground in Sanhe Port, Qidong County. The ship tilted for a while, and people panicked, causing a waiter and a boy on the ship to fall into the water and drown. They have been salvaged and buried and reported to the Shanghai Maritime Administration and the Qidong County Government. On the one hand, the Ping'an Company rewarded the county for continuing to salvage. Unexpectedly, on the 28th of the same month, when the ship arrived at Antou Port, it was suddenly detained and arrested by the Qidong County Government, who used the excuse that the ship had drowned many passengers and sent the Jingdong warship to detain the ship, cargo, and shipowner. After the steamship company sent people to request the shipping association and the association telegraphed for negotiations, the ship was released as a result, but the person was not allowed to be released on bail. Although the shipowner is responsible for the safety of the entire ship, this unexpected accident cannot be prevented by human efforts. The reason for the ship's grounding was actually due to the hidden dangers of the sandbar on the active navigation route. The shipowner's driving skills were not faulty. Moreover, the duty driver at that time was another person and was removed from his post by the Maritime Administration for investigation. The captain was not at fault. If the captain must be blamed, then ships running aground in the Qidong area are heard every month. Why is Ning alone blameless? The so-called drowning of passengers is not only false and unfounded, but even if it is a fact, it should be dealt with according to the law. How can the county government ignore right and wrong and arbitrarily detain people? (Omitted) What protection does our shipping industry have under maritime law? Now that the shipowner Wang Yunfa's bail is invalid, the association cannot sit idly by. While there is still breath, we should do our best to help and will not be subject to any forces to survive by chance in this civilized world. Currently, in addition to continuing to ask the authorities to negotiate according to reason, we hope that people from all walks of life will uphold justice and show sympathy and assistance. We also hope that our shipping colleagues and members of the association will rise up and unite, join forces to rescue, and oppose it unanimously. We must know that justice and power cannot stand together. Wang Yunfa's illegal trampling is the shame of all our seafarers. The association is determined to do its best to respond and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. The captain's freedom will not be restored for a day, and we will swear to fight for it for a day. It will not be resolved satisfactorily and will never give up.</p>
<h3>Seeking His Wife Unsuccessfully, He Attempted Suicide and Was Rescued</h3>
<p>At 1:45 p.m. yesterday, a small passenger boat from the Taikoo Company, the Kuai Da, was sailing from the Yangjingbang Wharf back to Pudong and arrived at Puxin. Suddenly, a young man jumped into the raging waves to commit suicide. Fortunately, the old boatman Zhao Shengsheng discovered it and immediately stopped the engine to rescue him. He was sent to the Customs Water Police Station. He confessed that his name was Wu Jirui, 29 years old, from Yangzhou. His wife worked in Shanghai and had not returned to his hometown for several years. He carried 18 yuan of travel expenses from his hometown to Shanghai a few days ago to find his wife. He had been looking for her for a month without any news, and his funds had run out of food and lodging, so he was tired of living and committed suicide. The detective chief ordered Bao Tan and He Kui to send him to the Yangzhou Fellow Association for relief.</p>
<h3>A Young Man in Yongle Hotel Attempted Suicide by Poisoning and Was Resuscitated</h3>
<p>At around 9 p.m. the night before, a young man came to Yongle Hotel at the intersection of Fujian Road and Guangdong Road to ask for accommodation. The hotel opened room No. 107 for him to live in. He claimed to be Shen Hezhi, 24 years old, from Shaoxing. After entering the room, he closed the door and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, at around 6 a.m. yesterday morning, the hotel tea attendant suddenly heard a moaning sound coming from the room. He quickly opened the door and went in, and saw Shen lying on his side of the bed, pale and incoherent. Knowing that something had happened, he hurriedly reported it to the police station and had him taken to the hospital for treatment. After being given an enema, he quickly woke up. When asked what happened, he confessed that he had previously worked in the Zhenchang Silk Factory on Quzhen Road, French Concession. Recently, the factory closed down and Shen also lost his job. His economy was deteriorating, so he resorted to this desperate measure and privately swallowed opium to commit suicide.</p>
<h3>The Result of a Gang Fight: Liu Jinfa Died from Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Sun Jieshou (also known as Sun Laosan), who lived in the Xiangyanqiao area of Hongkou, was quite powerful in that area and had many followers. He had long-standing grudges with Zhu Laosan. Although both parties had invited many people to negotiate, it was never resolved satisfactorily, so the feud became deeper and irreconcilable. At around 3 p.m. on September 3, both parties gathered their followers and fought at the entrance of Juxingli, Xiangyanqiao. As a result, people tried their best to mediate and the parties dispersed. However, Sun believed that he had lost face and would be despised in the future, so he scheduled another fight at the same place the next day. After both parties met (the code word for fighting), they immediately shouted and started fighting, as if facing a formidable enemy. For a time, they were fighting in several groups, using knives and sticks. Pedestrians ran away. The police on duty at the scene heard the news and rushed to arrest them. Unexpectedly, someone from Sun Jieshou's side opened fire and fired randomly. Liu Jinfa (21 years old, an apprentice in a silk shop at No. 21 Juxingli), who was from Hangzhou, was suddenly shot in the abdomen by a stray bullet. Liu was watching the commotion from the door and was unfortunately killed. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, and was seriously injured. He was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by a carriage. On the one hand, the police chased down and arrested the culprit Sun Jieshou and detained him in the police station under its jurisdiction and transferred him to the local court. The prosecutor questioned him and ordered him to be detained pending further instructions. After the injured person was sent to the hospital, the doctor found a gunshot wound on his left palm, and a gunshot wound on his abdomen. The bullets did not penetrate. The prosecutor of the court, Kong Xianglin, came to the hospital to confirm the injuries. The hospital performed an abdominal operation to remove the bullets and found eight bullet holes in the small and large intestines. He has been treated until now, almost a month, but Liu Jinfa's fever has been increasing recently. He died in the hospital due to his injuries at 11 p.m. the night before. The hospital telegraphed the police station to report it to the local court. Yesterday, prosecutor Lei Binzhang and examiner Xuan Zhiming were commissioned to come to the hospital to confirm the cause of death. The gunshot wound will be investigated further.</p>

<h3>Dismembered Corpse of a Man and Woman Found on Rue du Parc des Courses</h3>
<p>A Qi Was Indeed Chen Huasheng's Wife</p>
<p>Driven to Prostitution by Dire Poverty</p>
<p>The Tragedy's Root Cause Was Economic Hardship</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 3 p.m., Chen Huasheng, a 26-year-old Suzhou native residing in a garret of the Zhou Changji Tailor Shop at 55 Rue du Parc des Courses, suddenly stabbed his mistress, A Qi, to death with a sharp knife and then committed suicide. Details were reported in this newspaper yesterday morning. Subsequently, the Chengdu Road police station dispatched Detective No. 34, along with Chinese detective Pang Yutang, to investigate. They transported the bodies of the man and woman to the coroner's office on Route Père Robert. It is learned that the detectives discovered several letters in the deceased's room, all of which were Chen's requests for employment. One letter was addressed to his maternal uncle, Yang Zhongfu, who currently serves as a comprador in the insurance department of the Fairall &amp; Co. at 81 Rue Nanking. The detectives took the letter to the company to notify him, but he had already returned home. They then went to Yang's residence at 39 Hua'an Lane, North Zhejiang Road. The detectives explained their purpose, but the family claimed that Yang was out and seemed unwilling to acknowledge Chen's suicide. As for the woman, A Qi, she was a prostitute at Shao Qian's residence at 9 Yude Lane, Rue du Yunnan, soliciting clients every evening at Wing On Company and Tian Yun Lou. It is said that she was indeed Chen's wife, forced into this profession due to Chen's poverty to make a living. Yesterday morning around 10 a.m., Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuji, arrived at the coroner's office to examine the bodies. The chief of the Western Patrol first reported on the investigation process, then questioned Zhou A'gen, who testified that he was a tailor and the sub-landlord of the house. The deceased, Chen Huasheng, had rented his garret on August 13th, and the woman often came to visit. However, since moving in, the man and woman had only stayed together three times. Yesterday afternoon around 2 p.m., the woman arrived again, and around 3 p.m., they heard the woman scream for help. They immediately went upstairs to check, but the doors and windows were tightly closed, so they reported to the police before finally discovering the scene. Mr. Tang received the testimony and determined that the deceased, Chen Huasheng, was male, and Chen A Qi was female, and both died from knife wounds sustained while alive. As there were no known relatives, the bodies were handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for burial. It is said that detectives found only a bed, a table, and several pawn tickets in the deceased's room, with nothing else. Neither the man nor the woman had any money on them, so this tragedy was undoubtedly caused by economic pressure. It is also heard that the man's injuries were one to the right temple, two to the neck, and eight to the abdomen. The woman's injuries were two to the right temple, one to the left temple, five to the right abdomen, six to the right hand, and one to the left hand.</p>
<h3>Animal Protection Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>Held at the City Chamber of Commerce Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Party and Government Representatives Delivered Speeches</p>
<p>Yesterday was World Animal Day. The City Animal Protection Association held an animal protection propaganda conference at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon, starting at 2 p.m. Representatives from party and government agencies also attended and gave speeches, with entertainment provided to add to the atmosphere. Many guests attended, and the grand hall was nearly overflowing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(A Glimpse of the Venue) The conference venue, at the entrance of the City Chamber of Commerce, had the Party and National flags crossed and hung high. A long rectangular banner of bamboo cloth was erected in the middle, reading "China Animal Protection Association Animal Day Propaganda Conference." After entering the main gate, the sidewalks on both sides were covered with posters and written slogans. Inside the venue, small flags of various countries were crisscrossed, and slogans were posted on the walls. A rectangular table was placed on the Chairman's platform, with silver shields presented by various agencies and organizations arranged in a row, adorned with flower vases at both ends. Below the Party and National flags and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, there was another botanical illustration, created by a renowned artist.</p>
<p>(Attendees) Yesterday's attendees included the presidium: Ye Gongchuo, Kong Xiangxi (represented by Xu Jianping), Zhong Ketuo, Zhang Yichen, Huang Hanzhi, as well as City Party Headquarters representative Mao Yun, City Social Bureau representative Rao Qiangsheng, City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting, Buddhist Association Master Taixu, representatives from other organizations and agencies, and no fewer than several thousand spectators, making it a very lively event.</p>

<p>(Chairman's Report) As the ceremony began, Chairman Ye Gongchuo reported on the opening of the conference, briefly stating, "Since the association's preparation, we have received much support from all sectors. The association's affairs have progressed smoothly. Our association strives to promote animal protection universally, and taking advantage of the opportunity of today's World Animal Day, we are holding an expanded propaganda campaign, printing various slogans and promotional materials to distribute to everyone. We hope that everyone will never forget this, and to increase the interest of everyone attending, we will hold an entertainment conference after the meeting. Today, we also have party and government representatives here to guide us, and enthusiastic participation from guests from all walks of life. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the association."</p>
<p>(Representatives' Speeches) Next, City Party Headquarters representative Mao Yun gave a speech, briefly stating, "Some say that animal protection goes against the spirit of science, but that is not the case. The prosperity of science also starts from protecting animals. The methods may be different, but the act of protection has been advocated by all sectors of society, both at home and abroad, in ancient and modern times. In Western countries, in terms of law and morality, there are regulations for the protection of beneficial animals. Chinese Confucian and Buddhist families especially advocate animal protection. The motivation for protecting animals comes from the kindness of mankind, and the kindness of mankind is the important morality that maintains all peace. Therefore, we should also attach importance to animal protection." City Social Bureau representative Rao Qiangsheng then gave a speech, briefly stating, "Protecting animals is a good morality for mankind. Looking around at today's world, the situation is critical, and the habit of slaughtering is heartbreaking. It is not just man against beast, but man against man. In order to maintain world peace, we should make everyone have a compassionate heart. Protecting animals is to awaken the compassionate psychology of the general public. Once people know how to protect animals, the struggle between people can be eliminated."</p>

<p>(Guests' Speeches) Then, City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting gave a speech, briefly stating, "I am not good at rhetoric, so I do not want to say much. However, I express my sympathy for animal protection. Every time we kill an animal, whether large or small, it either makes a mournful sound or shows a pitiful, trembling appearance. Mencius said, 'Hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh.' This is what we can feel at all times. However, animal protection is easy to say but difficult to do, so we must always adhere to it and not betray the original intention of advocating it." Finally, Master Taixu gave a speech, briefly stating, "Animal protection is originally what Buddhists advocate. Now that all sectors of society are expressing sympathy and promoting it, this is something that we Buddhists are very happy about. Animal protection is to oppose slaughter, and slaughter is not tolerated by humanity. Therefore, animal protection is what humanity should strive for. I hope that everyone present can have a humane heart and protect animals from now on. This is what this monk earnestly hopes for." After the speeches, the entertainment began. The various programs were all very exciting, and the audience praised them endlessly.</p>

<p>At the corner of Rue Amiral d'Éstrées and Route Tenant de la Tour, in the French Concession, at 186, the Shengfaxiang Cotton Fluffing Shop, owned by Sheng Wenxiang (age 50), from Dachang, caught fire for unknown reasons at 4:15 p.m. yesterday. At the time, Sheng Wenxiang was at the Shengyongxing branch shop at the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Route Kuling on business, and only three apprentices were left in the Rue Amiral d'Éstrées shop. Sheng Wenxiang's wife, née Lu, was ill and lying upstairs. Upon hearing the fire alarm, she saw that the stairs had been burned away and jumped from the window, sustaining injuries from the fall. Although an ambulance from the New Gate Police Station arrived and took her to Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment, she died due to the severity of her injuries. The body is currently in the morgue. Fortunately, the New Gate Police Station fire brigade on Rue Amiral d'Éstrées was nearby, and the fire was extinguished in less than half an hour. The Feixingji New Clothes Shop and the Sihai Lou Restaurant on either side only suffered slight water damage.</p>
<p>The Hall of Longevity Suddenly Transformed into a Hall of Mourning</p>
<h3>A Sixtieth Birthday Celebration Ends in a Fatal Fall</h3>
<p>Yu Ziwang, a 58-year-old man from Taizhou who was involved in the sugar industry, and his wife, Zhu, who is now 60 years old, resided at 34 Jianyu Lane, Haichao Temple Road, outside Xiaonanmen. Recently, as it was Zhu's sixtieth birthday, Yu had specifically distributed invitations, inviting relatives and friends to his home to offer birthday congratulations. At around 2 p.m. that afternoon, he stood at the entrance of the lane, setting off firecrackers. At that time, Yang Yu, a young woman from Tongzhou (age 24), residing at 31 Jianyu Lane, was squatting by the public water tap in front of her house, washing clothes. Because she had not paid attention, she was startled by the sudden sound of firecrackers, and immediately stood up and accused Yu of setting off firecrackers without giving prior warning. Yu refused to accept this and retorted, leading to a conflict. Zhu, upon hearing this, immediately rushed out to mediate, but was unsuccessful. It is unknown how, but she suddenly fell to the ground, her face turning pale and her breathing becoming short. Yu, seeing this, urgently called his son, Guigen, and others to help him carry her into the house. Before long, Zhu stopped breathing and died. The Yu family was instantly filled with wails. The lively birthday celebration had turned into a hall of mourning. All the congratulatory guests had become mourners. In grief and anger, Yu immediately dragged Yang Yu to the patrol road police station in charge of the area, accusing her of pushing Zhu to her death. When Chief Jin of the police station questioned Yu, Yu Ziwang stated, "During the argument between me and Yu, my wife, Zhu, came out upon hearing the noise and slightly scolded her. Unexpectedly, in her anger, Yu forcefully pushed my wife, causing her to fall and die. Therefore, I have arrested her and request justice." Yang Yu stated in her testimony, "When I was in conflict with Yu Ziwang, I did not see Zhu come out to mediate, and I do not know how she died." Because Zhu's death was strange and involved a human life, in addition to ordering the local head to report to the local court for an inquest, Police Chief Zhang Hongxun was dispatched to Jianyu Lane to investigate with Yu's neighbors on the left and right. According to them, when Yu and Yang Yu were in conflict, Yu's wife, Zhu, came out upon hearing the noise and pulled Yu back home to avoid further dispute. However, because Yu was too angry, he pushed his hand away unintentionally, telling her that he did not want her to pull him, but unexpectedly Zhu was old and weak, and lost her balance, falling to the ground and dying. Then, at around 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Local Court dispatched a prosecutor, etc., to the scene. The inquest found no injuries on the body of the deceased, Zhu Yu. It was ordered that her body be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for dissection and examination that day for determination. After the inquest, they returned to the court. At the same time, the patrol road police station transferred both defendants to the court for questioning.</p>

Her husband, Wang Yingjiang, worked at the Dahua Flower Shop at 1619 Jing'an Temple Road, earning just enough to support the family. Since their marriage, they had been harmonious. However, Wang Dai liked to dress up and learn modern fashions. Recently, because she was going to a wedding at a relative's house in her hometown, she intended to ask her husband for more than ten dollars to buy leather shoes. Her husband, considering that they were not a wealthy family, felt that the expense could be avoided, so he refused her request. This led to an argument between them. Afterwards, Wang Dai suddenly became extremely resentful and conceived the idea of abandoning the world. Taking advantage of her husband's inattention, she sneaked into the bedroom and hanged herself. When her mother-in-law, Wang Zhang, and others discovered her, they tried to cut her down, but she was already barely breathing. They rushed her to Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate and transported the body to the coroner's office on Route Père Robert. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court, which appointed a prosecutor to examine the body. The coroner's office questioned Wang's mother-in-law, Wang Zhang, and Wang's husband, Wang Yingjiang, and confirmed the previous details. It was determined that the deceased, Wang Dai, a female, had indeed died by strangulation. Her husband, Wang Yingjiang, was ordered to sign a guarantee to take the body back for burial.</p>
<p>A Six-Year-Old Girl is Ravaged by a Servant</p>
<h3>The Daughter of Binghua Laoliu Marries a Western Detective and Lives Together</h3>
<p>The Two Servants Are Arrested and Sent to Court for Investigation</p>
<p>Western Detective Tanner of the Public Concession Police Force married a Chinese woman as his wife. The woman had previously fallen into prostitution, holding a license as a prostitute, her stage name being Binghua, the sixth among her sisters in the trade. Therefore, she was known as Binghua Laoliu in the flower business. Later, Laoliu met Tanner and was moved by the idea of changing her ways, and Tanner was also willing to pull her out of the mire. With their hearts aligned, they formed a lifelong alliance. However, Laoliu had already given birth to a daughter at the time. Tanner, with the intention of loving the house and its crow, took her in as well. She now lives at 22, Lane 231, Yuyuan Road, Hongkou. The girl is now six years old, her face still of the yellow race, her language completely changed to Western. Tanner treats her as his own, loving her like a pearl in his palm, giving her the name Mona Tanner. Unexpectedly, since mid-August, the girl's lower body suddenly developed abnormalities, constantly dripping. Her mother, Binghua Laoliu, was very suspicious and surprised, but could not understand the cause. She only paid attention to it occasionally. On the night of the second of this month, she saw the girl walking out of the bedroom of the servants Zhang Yongsheng and Zhu Asong. Suspecting that they were hiding something, she became even more suspicious. She dismissed Zhang and Zhu and questioned the girl strictly. The child could not deny it and confessed, finally revealing the cause of her illness, which was that she had been abused by Zhang and Zhu. She immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Detective Huang Zihong to arrest the two men. Zhang is now 24 years old, and Zhu is only 18 years old, both registered in Wenzhou. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, representing the police, charged Zhang and Zhu under Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting strict punishment. He also requested that the trial be closed to the public because it involved morality. Judge Liu immediately ordered everyone in the courtroom to withdraw and, after a long deliberation, ordered that the two defendants be detained pending a scheduled sentencing.</p>

<p>Central District Vegetable Market Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Constructed by the Xingye Trust Company</p>
<p>Mayor Wu is actively promoting the construction of the central district, sparing no effort. As a result, the number of residents has increased sharply, and the signs of prosperity are progressing day by day. Since the groundbreaking ceremony for the major stadium was held the day before yesterday, and the third call for land acquisition was announced, land prices have risen sharply in recent days, and citizens flock to visit in droves. Mayor Wu believes that the government should pay attention to public construction, and that other public works related to the people should be handled by the City Xingye Trust Company, as the city treasury's financial resources are insufficient. Recently, considering the dense population of the central district and the desire to benefit the public, the company was entrusted to plan vegetable markets and shops so that residents could conveniently purchase vegetables and daily necessities nearby. The company has always taken serving the citizens as its duty. After being entrusted by the municipal government, it actively made preparations.

Many people have come to the company in recent days to discuss leasing the remaining six shops. The company will use a lottery method to allocate them, in order to ensure fairness. It is planned to continue construction in the future depending on the situation, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Public Works Department Considers the One-Way Traffic Problem on Hankou Road</h3>
<p>Plans to Convert Jiujiang Road into One-Way as Well</p>
<p>Still Awaiting Discussion Between the Police and Public Works Departments</p>
<p>Recently, shops on Hankou Road in the Public Concession requested that the one-way traffic measure be abolished, and received the sympathy and support of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Chamber of Commerce. This matter was brought up for discussion by the Public Works Department's Traffic Committee. According to the Police Department's report, the current measure has a significant effect on traffic and is necessary to continue implementing this system during busy hours for the convenience of the public. The committee members also felt that this was a good idea for the benefit of the majority. Then, the Director General stated that the Chairman of the Board had a new plan that could be called a remedy, which was to convert Jiujiang Road into one-way traffic as well, with Hankou Road and Jiujiang Road operating one-way all day, one eastward and one westward. However, the implementation of this proposal would inevitably face difficulties and was still awaiting long-term discussion between the Police and Public Works Departments. As for the commercial impact of the current measure, the Director General stated that it was difficult to answer this question because of the economic downturn and the closure of shops in various parts of the concession. The Director of the Public Works Department said that the current one-way traffic measure on Hankou Road was convenient for automobiles, but at the intersection of Hankou Road and Xizang Road, vehicles had to turn north and south, which often caused congestion. Therefore, the more vehicles there were on Hankou Road, the worse the congestion would be on Xizang Road. After discussion, the members believed that the one-way traffic measure on Hankou Road was still more beneficial than harmful. As for the protest from the shops, it would be considered after the Police and Public Works Departments conducted a survey report on whether Jiujiang Road could also be implemented at the same time. This committee record was submitted to the board of directors on October 3 and was approved for record.</p>
<h3>New Factory Completion Ceremony Held Yesterday at the Shanghai Branch of Sincere Cosmetics Company</h3>
<p>Presided over by Minister Chen and Mayor Wu</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Sincere Cosmetics Company, having built a new factory on Maqi Road, held a completion ceremony yesterday at 2:00 PM. Among the attendees were Chen Gongbo, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Ji Zejin, Lao Jingxiu, Wu Shaozeng, Fan Shouzhi, Wang Boqi, Li Mingzhi, Tang Baoshu, Zhang Zhuping, Xiang Kangyuan, Xiang Shengwu, as well as over two thousand Chinese and foreign guests. The ceremony began at 2:00 PM, presided over by Ma Yingbiao, with Ling Ziguang as the master of ceremonies. After Chairman Ma delivered the opening remarks, Chen Gongbo unveiled the plaque and gave a speech, followed by a speech from Wu Tiecheng. The chairman then gave a closing speech. Photographs were taken, refreshments were served, and each guest received four cosmetic products from the factory for promotional purposes.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Mr. Ma Yingbiao, the general manager of Sincere Company, began by recounting the history. He stated that after the company pioneered the non-bargaining department store, its business flourished. Following the principle of revitalizing industry, a cosmetics manufacturing plant was established in Guangzhou in the early years of the Republic. Since its products were launched, they have been well-received by society. Consequently, the main manufacturing plant was expanded in Hong Kong, and products were sold in the South Seas Islands and overseas. Branches and agencies were established in various provinces within the country. In recent years, the popularity of the company's products among the Chinese people has grown even more fervently. The original location on Huade Road in Shanghai was no longer sufficient, so a state-of-the-art factory was built on Maigen Road in western Shanghai to increase production and fulfill the desire to promote domestic goods. Today's opening ceremony is being held with the hope that leaders from all sectors will support domestic manufacturers, allowing them to thrive. He expressed his deep honor for the presence and guidance of Minister Chen, Mayor Wu, and leaders from all sectors, and offered his sincere thanks.</p>
<p>Minister Chen Unveils the Plaque: After the Chairman's report, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo performed the unveiling ceremony and delivered a speech, saying, "Today, Sincere Cosmetics Company is holding the opening ceremony of its new factory. I am very honored to be invited by the host to participate in this grand event. I have two thoughts to share today. First, China's industry is lagging behind, and domestic department stores have largely become marketplaces for selling foreign goods. In fact, many department stores now have their own factories, manufacturing and vigorously promoting domestic products. Sincere Company's establishment of a factory to manufacture cosmetics to resist foreign goods is a prime example. Therefore, I hope that the management of Sincere Cosmetics Company will continue to refine their products and strive for expansion, and that various sectors will successively establish factories so that in the future, major department stores will become general mechanisms for promoting domestic goods. Second, I also hope that consumers from all sectors of society will support domestic factories and purchase domestic goods, jointly promoting domestic goods and consolidating the foundation of domestic factories. Then the future of domestic factories will be limitless. Finally, I wish Sincere Cosmetics Company a prosperous future."</p>

<p>Mayor's Speech: Next, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech, briefly stating, "In the past two years, social enterprises in our country have been declining daily, and the market is flooded with foreign goods. Almost everything in the shops is foreign-made. Taking cosmetics as an example, according to customs reports, in 1929, imports amounted to five million, and in 1930, six million. The increase is alarming. In recent times, the movement to promote domestic goods has emerged, but in 1934, customs reports show that imports have reached 40 million. If this continues, it is truly worrisome. I hope that the Chinese people can unanimously promote domestic goods to stem the tide. The most important things that domestic companies should pay attention to are: 1. Hiring and manufacturing methods must be modernized and scientific in order to gradually improve domestic goods. 2. Banks should not engage in high-interest exploitation. According to Japanese yarn factories, the interest rate for loans from banks is only 3-4%, while in our country, it can be 2-3%. This kind of high interest is a real obstacle to the development of commerce. 3. Merchants' ethics should emphasize the high skill and quality of materials, but in reality, the workmanship is clumsy and the goods are inferior, only caring about personal gain and not considering whether the buyer can actually use the product. This also hinders the future of domestic goods, because deception can only obscure the truth temporarily. Eventually, the truth will come out, and users will lose faith. Finally, labor and capital must work together. Capital should not disregard the interests of workers, and workers should not make excessive demands on capital. Only through mutual understanding can we jointly seek welfare."</p>
<p>Guided Tour: After the photo session, factory staff led a tour of the internal workings of the factory. After the tour, guests were treated to refreshments and presented with various products of the factory. The event concluded joyfully around 3:00 PM.</p>

He secretly took raw opium early in the morning at 7:15 AM. The bellboy discovered him and rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died at 11:10 AM. The deceased had written a suicide note to the hotel manager, stating that he had stayed at the hotel for four days without any success and was temporarily using it as his burial place, hoping to repay the kindness in the next life. (2) Chang Zhongxuan, a 35-year-old from Taixing, worked in the materials department of the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 645 Kunming Road, Liaoyang Road.

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read today's newspaper article about the Customs Commissioner advising shipping companies to comply with the pilotage rules of the Songhu District, the article stated that shipping companies would hold another meeting to discuss the matter, which is not true. The Pilotage Management Committee's proposed increase in pilotage fees was resolved by the companies concerned, and the association appealed to the Yuanbu (central government ministry). Since this matter is not entirely under the jurisdiction of the Customs, the Customs Commissioner is merely giving advice. Before Yuanbu gives instructions, shipping companies have no need to hold further meetings. The information in your newspaper is likely a misunderstanding based on hearsay. Please correct the record to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Trade Association</p>
<p>October 4th</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Counties Facing Education Funding Crisis; Provincial Education Department Seeks Relief Measures</h3>
<p>▲ Education Bureau Chiefs from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing Provinces Jointly Petition: Zhejiang Province has been severely affected by drought this year. Land taxes have virtually ceased, and with the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the source of education funding for various counties has dried up. Almost half of the primary schools in the province have been forced to close, and nearly 20,000 teachers have lost their jobs. Education bureaus in various counties have tried their best to tighten their belts and reduce salaries, but they are still facing huge deficits and have nothing to work with. Now, with all possible avenues exhausted and fundraising proving difficult, the education bureau chiefs from the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou regions have joined forces and petitioned the provincial government, requesting the allocation of funds from provincial public bonds for relief. Yesterday, the education bureau chiefs from Shaoxing and other counties, including Wang Tianze, Xu Zhaokui, Li Qihuang, Cheng Fenglai, and Yu Zongjie, also jointly petitioned the provincial government, requesting the allocation of 150,000 yuan to maintain operations. Other regions are also experiencing similar education funding shortages and may take similar actions. The Provincial Education Department, after learning about the situation in various counties, is drafting relief measures to prevent the foundation of local education from being disrupted due to the disaster. Once the plan is drafted, it will be submitted to the provincial government for discussion and implementation after approval.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Students Abroad Request Subsidies</h3>
<p>According to surveys conducted by various embassies, among the more than 50 northeastern students studying in Europe and America, only a few (who receive other subsidies) do not receive subsidies. Generally, subsidies for government-funded students are ongoing on an annual basis, while privately funded students receive a one-time subsidy of several hundred yuan without any continuation. It is reported that northeastern self-funded students studying in Europe and America who have already received a one-time subsidy hope to continue receiving subsidies, while those who have not received subsidies are requesting them. They are requesting assistance from the Northeastern Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education. However, the office has a fixed annual budget for subsidizing students, and it is currently drafting a comprehensive relief plan for the next year and submitting it to the Ministry of Education for approval.</p>
<h3>Measures for Protecting and Reinstating Jiangsu Province Education Personnel</h3>

Article 2: All administrative personnel of educational institutions who have been commended by the Department of Education shall, unless they are promoted or resign, continue to hold their positions, as long as they do not violate regulations for dismissal.

<h3>Ministry of Education to Revise Regulations for Provincial and Municipal School Inspectors</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on reports from provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus regarding inspections by school inspectors, as well as reports from ministry-appointed education inspectors, believes that the provincial and municipal school inspector regulations established by the ministry three years ago need revision. It has instructed the relevant divisions to draft revisions separately. It is said that the revisions will generally raise the qualifications for school inspectors, emphasizing not only graduation from formal schools but also service experience and qualification for official appointment.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Considers Japanese Bridge's Proposal for Reforming Education Policy in the Settlement</p>
<h3>▲Allocating Educational Funds to Subsidize Schools Run by Residents of Various Nationalities</h3>
<p>The Japanese Residents' Corporation recently submitted a proposal advocating fundamental changes to the Shanghai Municipal Council's education policy. The proposal includes four points: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Council should no longer manage or operate schools; (2) The Shanghai Municipal Council should allocate educational funds to subsidize schools run by residents of various nationalities; (3) The total amount of subsidies should be based on the regular and temporary education expenses in the 1934 budget; (4) The amount allocated to each school should be proportional to the number of students or based on the amount of taxes paid. This proposal was submitted to the Education Committee for detailed consideration. The committee expressed the following opinions: (1) It is unclear whether the original proposal refers only to Municipal Council-run schools for non-Chinese children or includes the entire Municipal Council education system; (2) If the original proposal includes Chinese schools, it is unclear how the funding allocation proposal would apply to them; (3) If the proposal is limited to foreign children's schools, it is impossible for residents of all nationalities (the Municipal Council schools have students of 36 nationalities) to run their own schools; (4) Municipal Council-run schools treat students of all nationalities equally; (5) If the proposal is adopted, the Shanghai Municipal Council's education policy would be completely changed, and all educational institutions would be closed down, rendering previously detailed plans futile. The Education Committee's opinions were submitted to the Board of Directors for discussion on October 3. The Board of Directors decided to ask the Education Committee to further study the Japanese Residents' Corporation's proposal, formulate opinions and methods, and then submit them to the Board of Directors for approval.</p>

One type of storytelling, one song, and three plays need to be revised and re-reviewed. Four types of plays, one type of Yijuan, eight types of storytelling, and five songs were not approved for broadcasting. Furthermore, because Siming Opera is considered to have crude material and is largely obscene, which is detrimental to the public good and social customs, the bureau has sent a letter to the International Telecommunications Bureau, ordering all radio stations to ban its broadcasting from now on.</p>

<h3>Malay Prince from Makassar Comes to China to Study</h3>
<p>▲Successfully Negotiated with Tongji University Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Will Move into the School Immediately to Attend Classes</p>
<p>Anwar, the son of Sultan Sonda of Makassar, Celebes, Netherlands East Indies, has graduated from a Dutch high school. Recently, Sultan Sonda admired the simple customs and developed culture of our country, and also admired the well-managed and world-renowned Tongji University. He entrusted Mr. Wang Defen, our country's consul in Singapore, to introduce him to Mr. Pan Gongzhan, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, for placement. Anwar arrived in Shanghai on the first of this month. First, Liu Shimu and Huang Suofeng, directors of the China-South Seas Cultural Society, accompanied him to the Municipal Education Bureau to meet with Director Pan. Pan assigned commissioner Zhou Shang to handle this matter. On the morning of the 4th, Zhou, Liu, and Huang accompanied Anwar to Tongji University to discuss admission procedures. Because Dr. Weng Zhilong, the president of the university, was in Beijing on official business, he was received by Secretary Dr. Du Dianying. Dr. Du immediately agreed to place him in a suitable class according to his level after an examination. Dr. Du also emphasized that Nanyang (Southeast Asia) is a place where overseas Chinese thrive and develop, and maintaining good relations is crucial. He paid great attention to this. When Anwar returned to Shanghai from Wusong, he visited the Municipal Government, where he was received by Section Chief Li Dachao. Afterwards, he was hosted at a banquet at the Xinya Restaurant and accompanied to visit the Shanghai Bank and other places.</p>
<p>A Humble Opinion on Implementing Productive Education (3)</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan's Speech at the Third District Education Association Members' Meeting, Rapidly Recorded by Wang Gongxia</h3>
<p>(Without money, we can catch up head-on.) How should we implement productive education? In my personal opinion, the first thing is to make schools productive and vocational. Secondary schools can certainly run productive schools. Elementary schools are national education and basic education, and it seems that they cannot all be converted into productive schools. However, except for short-term elementary schools specifically for literacy, we can try to incorporate productive education components into elementary schools as much as possible. In other words, we must find ways to make the curriculum and facilities of primary and secondary schools productive within the possible scope of existing funding for primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of Shanghai, the municipal secondary schools include Jingye, Wuben, Yangjing, Wusong, and Xinlu Normal School. What should we do? Suppose that among these five schools, we first recognize one excellent ordinary secondary school, co-educational, and continue to run it as a regular secondary school, training general students who are preparing to go to university after graduating from junior and senior high school. The students of this school must be particularly excellent in terms of talent, physique, and knowledge. All examinations must be very serious, and management must be particularly strict. In the future, these more outstanding schools can be given advanced training. In addition to an ordinary secondary school, the normal school must also be recognized. However, the students trained by this normal school must have at least one industrial or agricultural skill in addition to the knowledge in the textbooks. Especially the normal school students who are preparing to teach in rural areas in the future should have their own hands-on skills and experience in agriculture and handicrafts. In this way, although the name is a normal school, it can actually be linked to production. In addition to an ordinary secondary school and a normal school, the remaining three secondary schools can be appropriately changed to senior or junior productive schools, with the curriculum re-arranged and given some emphasis. At least there should be a small farm or workshop or other business practice site. In this way, even if it is still a regular secondary school in name and the name is not changed, it has actually become a vocational and productive secondary school. At the same time, there is not much change in funding. At most, a little increase in equipment funding may be possible to find. Isn't this a more economical way?</p>
<p>What about elementary schools? We can divide elementary schools into two categories. One is specifically for popularizing literacy, and we can simply run short-term elementary schools or children's people's schools. The other is elementary schools that are run for the purpose of going to higher schools. We must also find ways to strive for production. Naturally, elementary school students cannot have productive capacity, but at least they must lay a good foundation for going to productive middle schools to study and seek skills in the future. Under no circumstances can we let all or most of them have the mindset of going to middle school, going to university, going abroad to become officials and getting rich. Elementary school graduates completely go to middle school, go to university, and go abroad to study. This is a dream, because there are financial constraints and so on. Only one-seventh of primary school graduates go to high school, only one-third of high school graduates go to junior high school, and only one-fourth of junior high school graduates go to senior high school. Therefore, among 10,000 primary school students, less than 500 enter university. But if we look at the current elementary school education, it can almost be said that it is entirely for the purpose of going to higher schools. If they do not go to higher schools after graduation, they will have no interest in production and no basis for productive capacity. Therefore, in elementary school education, we must pay attention to subjects close to natural science so that they have a basis for production. It can also make them feel satisfied when they enter productive schools in the future. On the one hand, we teachers must do our best to change the minds of students and their parents, so that they know the current situation. Entering ordinary middle schools is not glorious. Do not think that going to an ordinary middle school and graduating from university in the future can make a big official. Entering a productive school can only be a farmer, worker, or businessman in the future, at most a factory director or manager. On the other hand, quickly set up small farms or factories so that they have the opportunity to practice productive skills. In this way, although it is not the name of a productive elementary school, it is close to the productive environment and skills, and the foundation of productive education can be laid.

<h3>Daxia University Implements a Universal Advisor System</h3>
<p>Daxia University has been implementing the advisor system for five years, and it has been quite effective over the years. Starting this autumn, the original system will be expanded and improved. All students in the university's colleges and normal school departments will be divided into 33 groups according to their major and minor subjects, and 33 advisors will be hired by the president to be responsible for providing guidance on academic studies, cultivation, careers, and life outside of coursework. The guidance period will last from the student's enrollment until graduation. The important measures are listed below:</p>
<p>▲Main Principles: There are five main principles of the school's advisor system: (1) Realizing the unity of teaching and guidance; (2) Practicing thrift and righteousness; (3) Carefully investigating personality; (4) Guiding academic research; (5) Assisting in solving life problems.</p>
<p>▲Group Implementation: After the school opened this semester, it immediately hired Lu Jizeng, Tai Shuangqiu, Wu Zelin, Tang Wenkai, Shao Jialin, Sun Haoxuan, Zhang Yuannian, Dong Renjian, Jun Yi, Chen Zhuzun, Fu Shishuo, Wu Haoran, and 33 others as advisors. It also convened a meeting of all advisors to formulate grouping methods. The Student Affairs Department will arrange the groups according to the student's college, department, major, and minor subjects, distributing them evenly across each grade, with 30 to 50 people in each group, in order to ensure thoroughness. The school's academic affairs meeting has also detailed the advisor regulations and implementation rules, stipulating the procedures for various guidance methods.</p>
<p>▲Four Advantages: According to the school authorities, there are four main advantages to promoting the universal advisor system this time: (1) Starting from academics and providing separate guidance can facilitate academic discussions, special research, career guidance, and personal problem consultation between advisors and students, and develop their special talents; (2) It is permanent. From enrollment to graduation, students are always under the guidance of the advisor, who can thoroughly understand their temperament, attitude, and outlook on life in order to teach according to their aptitude; (3) The organization is complete. The Student Affairs Department formulates student survey forms, which are divided into more than ten items, including family status, personal health, temperament, and interests, which are filled out by the advisor after a detailed examination and attached with an explanation as the basis for implementing guidance. At the same time, the advisor meeting gathers expert opinions to jointly discuss and solve practical problems; (4) The methods are improved. The scope of guidance for each advisor is divided into self-study, self-government, health, communication, and social services. In addition to not violating the principles of moral education, the methods can be freely determined by the advisor, or the advisor can schedule group or individual talks with each student every week, or students can raise questions and ask the advisor at any time.</p>
<h3>Qianye Junior High School Alumni Association's First Sound</h3>

<h3>New Phenomena in the Fudan College of Science</h3>
<p>All Graduates Have Jobs</p>
<p>In recent years, the Fudan authorities have strived to expand the College of Science. It is reported that the Ministry of Education allocated 15,000 yuan in national currency specifically for the use of the College of Science. The woodworking factory built by the college during the summer vacation this year has been completed for many days and is expected to begin practice this week. The graduates who are serving outside have been deeply trusted by all parties. Therefore, there are many letters from the outside world inviting students from the college of science to go to work. As for the past graduates, they all have jobs early. How are Dongcai, Zhang Wenqi, and Ye Bin currently employed by the Guangxi Construction Department? Lu Hanguang is employed by the Guangxi Provincial Government, Chen Qingshu and Tang Bangwei are employed by the Guangzhou Hualong Construction Company, Wu Chaozhu was sent by the Guangdong Provincial Government to the Czech Republic to study the beer industry, and Yu Ximan is employed by the Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau of the Yuehan Railway, and is also the director of the Shawan office of the Fourth Section of the North Seventh General Section.</p>
<h3>Shen Leiyu Returns to the Country Passing Through, Recounts Overseas Chinese in Medan Planning to Run Vocational Education</h3>
<p>Shen Leiyu, an expert member of the Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standard Drafting Committee of the Ministry of Education, was hired by overseas Chinese in Sumatra, Netherlands, this spring to serve as the principal of Peishan School. Because he was not used to the southern life, he resigned after the Dengpo period expired (according to the Dutch government, the government first allows residence for six months, which is called the Dengpo period, and then requests residence, which is called the residence period). He returned to the country by Italian Post Office Kangtuo Futian on yesterday and stayed at the Shenzhou Hotel. When the reporter asked about his feelings about the southern tour, Shen said that the Dutch government’s public security and road administration are commendable. Doors are not closed at night, and one can sleep soundly. Entering the vast forest late at night, I have not heard of any encounters with robbers. Asphalt roads extend in all directions, climbing to high mountains of 4,800 feet, as if walking on a smooth road, reaching the top in an instant. It is a pity that overseas Chinese are affected by the world's shadow gas, and their position as intermediaries is declining day by day, which is very regrettable. I heard that when passing through Medan, the capital of the island of Sumatra, overseas Chinese leaders Qiu Weicai and Xie Liantang, etc., in view of the lack of vocational education for overseas Chinese youths, plan to establish short-term training vocational schools next year, and asked Shen to plan and recruit appropriate teachers to go to the country to handle it.</p>
<h3>First Day of the Baichuan Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>▲ Members' General Assembly Proposes the Government Host a National Art Exhibition</p>
<p>The first Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition of the Baichuan Painting and Calligraphy Society opened at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday at the Lake Society Auditorium on Guizhou Road in this city. Despite the autumn wind and rain, there was an enthusiastic turnout of visitors braving the weather. At 4:00 PM, the Members' General Assembly was held. Members present included Huang Binhong, Wang Jiyuan, Yan Kechang, Wu Mengfei, Liu Kang, Wang Yuanbo, Liang Shu, Zhang Xian, Chen Renhao, Mo Yunxuan, Zhu Wenyun, Lu Yifei, Hu Youge, Wu Wenzhi, Zhu Lesan, Xu Zhengbai, Yu Jianhua, Song Banggan, Wang Shengyuan, Zhang Tianqi, Liu Hairuo, Zhang Chenbo, Lang Yunfei, Xu Peiji, Tang Tie, Xu Zexi, Ma Gongyu, Zhang Yiping, Deng Meisheng, Xie Gongzhan, Liu Shuxun, and Cao Yunzhong. Wang Jiyuan chaired the meeting, and Yan Kechang served as the secretary. Many resolutions were passed, the most important of which was a proposal to the government to continue holding a national art exhibition in order to cultivate national vitality and enhance international perspective. An express mail telegram was sent immediately as follows: To President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education of the National Government of Nanjing: At today's general meeting, this society resolved to request that the government promptly organize a national art exhibition to promote our nation's inherent culture and highlight the spirit of our people. At a time when various countries around the world are making efforts to praise Oriental art, our government, even during this period of national crisis, should raise the spirit of the nation and promote cultural endeavors to encourage writers to strive and cultivate national vitality. Even from the perspective of national production, it is necessary to popularize an appreciation of art. Art is by no means merely a decoration for a peaceful world, as some people mistakenly believe; rather, it is the crystallization of our national thought and is closely related to production and education. Although our country's science lags behind others, our inherent art has a significant position internationally. The fact that art galleries and museums around the world are competing to collect and display ancient and modern Chinese art works is a clear indication of this. As members of the Chinese nation, we, the members of this society, dare not remain silent on this matter concerning national culture. We are sending this telegram to respectfully request that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry consider the actual needs, submit the matter to the Central Political Conference, and promptly organize a national art exhibition to correct international perceptions. We respectfully request your consideration and approval. Deeply grateful, Wang Jiyuan and others of the Shanghai Baichuan Painting and Calligraphy Society.</p>

<h3>What Kind of Critics Do We Need?</h3>
<p>— Ding Yishan</p>
<p>This topic is too unoriginal, which is precisely why it is used here. Many things, when fresh, can make people dizzy, and later, they may find them laughable. This phenomenon is not difficult to find in the literary scene, especially in criticism and introductions.</p>
<p>A writer said in a private letter that someone had criticized his book, but the critic did not know the source of the material in his article, which caused him considerable emotion.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the good critics in the literary world, some (critics) have merely read a few books on foreign literary criticism and then point fingers and blame indiscriminately, thinking themselves extraordinary. Using foreign theories in China can only be used as assistance, but when it goes beyond assistance and becomes application, there is a problem. Although literary theory has no national boundaries, there are still considerable differences in terms of relative space and time in its application.</p>
<p>There seem to be plenty of critics who pick up foreign theories and fight, and they come from different sources, whether from America, Japan, or Europe. As a result, there is a phenomenon of mutual chaotic battles among critics.</p>
<p>Under the current objective conditions in China—politics, economy, education level, social system, production technology, cultural background—whether it is possible to completely transplant and apply foreign literary theories is quite problematic. We have our own special national conditions. While we may borrow from literary theories arising from other special national conditions, we need our own critics even more.</p>
<p>First, he must be familiar with China's national conditions and have a considerable study and understanding of China's social reality and historical culture. In other words, he must have a social science education, and then, based on this education, understand China's special national conditions, and criticize literary works, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of the articles, whether the descriptions are reasonable, the impact of the articles on readers (which requires actual observation), and how to make the descriptions in literary works accurately express the special national conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, rich knowledge and experience are also necessary. A critic should not simply say whether a work is good or bad by emptyly tossing around a few terms. He must at least have the same academic ability and experience as the author and be able to correct the author's carelessness. As for easily overlooked errors and distorted concepts, the critic must have rich knowledge and experience to point them out.</p>
<p>In addition, critics should have an objective attitude. A fair critic should not speak indiscriminately for the sake of (praising) and hatred. Of course, we cannot expect him not to write articles for fees, but he should criticize objectively, at least to some extent, for the sake of criticism.</p>
<p>Fair critics with rich knowledge and experience who understand China's national conditions can lead criticism onto a healthy path, support the development of articles, and convince readers and authors. Meaningless criticism is better than none.</p>
<h3>A Night at Shezi</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>The dilapidated watchtower, with some wind- and rain-sheltering yellow bamboo mats stretched on top, stood at the entrance of the town, bathed in the golden evening sun, looking very much like a wounded soldier with a bandage wrapped around his head, standing there weakly and exhaustedly, trying his best to fulfill his duty as a guard.</p>
<p>When I saw this landscape painting in the sunset from the distant field path, I knew that Shezi, which I had been talking about on the journey, had appeared before the traveler. Thus, the trembling feeling that I had been holding in my heart in the uninhabited wilderness, on the dark and gloomy pine ridges, and in the cold and damp mountain gorges, completely slipped out of my chest all at once.</p>
<p>The small plains outside the town, covered with wheat seedlings, rapeseed, and broad bean seedlings, had previously been painted with golden sunset, but as the red setting sun sank, the color gradually faded, and a thin mist of spring dusk quietly replaced it. People were driving herds of cattle home in the dim evening light. From the village houses rising with evening smoke, came a few lazy barks of dogs. The lights in the surrounding houses were blinking pleasantly.</p>
<p>This was the time when travelers should be seeking lodging.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I was alone, without goods, and speaking a foreign dialect, I was waved away and rejected by several households in the town. So, carrying a small package and a bit of sorrow, I wandered around the cobblestone streets.</p>
<p>There were no lights on the street, only the flames of pine torches, with tails of black smoke, flickered anxiously in the small iron plates on the walls, driven by the evening wind rolling down from the ridges. Militiamen in plain clothes with earthen guns often turned their faces over their shoulders, flashing two sharp eyes.</p>
<p>The traveler's sorrow at the ends of the earth and the coldness of the world sneaked into my heart like two snakes.</p>
<p>Only the person who set up a stall by the dirt steps selling liquor and snacks greeted me with a welcoming face. So, thinking of having a drink, I squatted down, extremely tired. The wind blew past the pine torches, carrying a large amount of thick smoke, rushing straight at my face in gusts, but I couldn't care less. At this time, I needed a bit of warm human kindness and temporary rest.</p>
<p>(Ha)</p>
<p>I only said I wanted to buy a few coppers' worth, but the liquor handed to me was a full rice bowl, which surprised me, because I couldn't drink that much.</p>
<p>(The liquor here is very good!)</p>
<p>A slightly drunk man squatting next to me, peeling peanuts and drinking liquor, gave me a gentle glance, saying this, as if praising the liquor and urging me to drink heartily.</p>
<p>(The taste is not bad!)</p>
<p>I put the liquor bowl to my lips and uttered this sentence unintentionally. He raised his voice and continued, saying:</p>
<p>(Yes! You'll know it's good as soon as you taste it.)</p>
<p>People with similar tastes in the world probably easily get to know each other. So, he and I naturally began to talk about this and that, and this town, which was hostile to strangers, seemed to slowly become better in my eyes. When I poured all the liquor I had only sipped a little of into his bowl, his hand, stained with pork intestine oil, happily patted my shoulder, and he even said such kind words:</p>
<p>(We like guests, why didn't you knock on my door?)</p>
<p>When he was leaving, he held up three fingers to the liquor seller, pointed them in the air, and muttered vaguely:</p>
<p>(Remember, remember, including the last time, a total of three hundred).</p>
<p>The liquor seller scratched his braided head, making a very embarrassed face.</p>
<p>(Give him a little, tomorrow, um, look, I have no goods.)</p>
<p>He vigorously waved his hands towards the small stall illuminated by the pine torches, and then said:</p>
<p>(You ask him to give you the money for the night's lodging first!)</p>
<p>He turned his eyes to look at me, and very kindly pushed me a little.</p>
<p>(It's the same, you give it to him first!)</p>
<p>I agreed, because he was the only person in this town who could give me warmth, and even if I shouldn't pay for the night's lodging, I should give him generous assistance.</p>
<p>I helped him walk back, staggering all the way. The light of the pine torches on the street was already beginning to weaken, and the shadows of darkness boldly fell from the sky. In the distance, there was the sound of knocking on a clapper. The town's noise and bustle seemed to have quietly slipped away. At the wooden door of a house, I knocked lightly, as he instructed.</p>
<p>(Who is it?)</p>
<p>A girl asked in a shrill voice. I tugged at his elbow and asked him:</p>
<p>(Is that your daughter?)</p>
<p>(Uhh) He nodded, and I responded to the inside:</p>
<p>(Your dad's home).</p>
<p>(What thing? What thing?)</p>
<p>A woman suddenly shouted angrily. He quickly pulled me away and said in a low, urgent voice:</p>
<p>(Let's go, let's go, it's bad, it's bad, I got the wrong house.)</p>
<p>He stumbled a few times on the street, staggering along, and a series of curses came from behind.</p>
<p>(May you be sliced to death, may you be beaten to death...)</p>
<p>He was simply too drunk, and couldn't even find his home. At the same time, a sudden gust of fierce cold wind blew, and his drunkenness intensified. If I hadn't been helping him walk, he would have collapsed on the street. As for where we were actually staying, he could only answer with an "uhh," and a little white foam bubbled from his mouth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we met a militiaman, and finally asked for his home, but after patting on the door for a long time, we only heard one or two curses in response.</p>
<p>(Drunkard, who told you to come back? Why don't you just get drunk and die outside!)</p>
<p>Later, a little girl's voice said softly:</p>
<p>(Mom! Mom!)</p>
<p>(What? Do you want to open the door for him? Watch me beat you to death!)</p>
<p>I knew there was no hope of getting in, and turned to look at him. This poor drunkard had already fallen asleep under the steps like a scarecrow, and was snoring slowly and steadily.</p>
<p>(Alas, old Chinese man!)</p>
<p>I had no choice but to sit next to him and doze off helplessly.</p>
<p>The quiet night surrounded the two of us. After the sound of the clapper stopped, from the distant wilderness (perhaps on the other side of the mountain), the sound of earthen guns rang out steadily, once or twice.</p>
<h3>Green and White</h3>

<h3>New Inventions in Aviation</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>French scientists have recently invented a new method that makes airplanes fly in the air very stably, with safe takeoffs and landings, and almost entirely through automatic mechanisms. It has now been adopted by the French Air Force. It is said that this invention could become a revolution in the history of aviation and could allow the French Air Force to dominate the skies. Recently, scientists have experimented with using radio to control unmanned airplanes. With this new invention, aviators can sit comfortably in their offices, holding the radio switch in one hand, commanding the advance and retreat of distant airplanes. This will definitely be realized soon.</p>
<p>This new method is based on the principle of gyroscopes, creating a simple safety mechanism that allows airplanes to rotate and stand upright, descend straight down, and fly smoothly, all at the pilot's command, stably and incomparably. All actions only require pressing a button with a finger. This simple piloting technique is convenient for pilots, and even people who have not been trained can learn it with just one lesson.</p>
<p>This invention makes it possible for airplanes to fly in clouds, fog, or complete darkness, ensuring safety and preventing accidents due to excessive speed and sudden braking. Even landing in the dark is much easier than before.</p>
<p>This method was invented by three French technical engineers, Dai Lun, George, and Avelin, together with Piena and Grigny, after several years of research. From July 1933 to the end of July this year, they conducted multiple tests with various airplanes at the Istres airfield near Marseille. Experienced aviators and technical experts carefully observed the site and all said that this invention is extremely significant for the future of aviation. After many tests, the French Air Force adopted it, and soon French airplanes will be equipped with this new mechanism.</p>
<p>This mechanism is a row of five buttons that control ascending, descending, level flight, left turn, and right turn. All five buttons are connected to a panel, which is said to be much more accurate than manual levers. Furthermore, landing only requires pressing a button, and the airplane will naturally ascend and descend, which even children can do. Ascending and descending are the two most important movements in flight, and pilots are most concerned about them at that time. From now on, they can fly comfortably. In the future, it will be possible to control these five buttons with radio waves from a very distant central location. Then, in the event of war, many bombers can be launched from the headquarters without being manned, and they will fly to the enemy's airspace to carry out bombing. Isn't this of great military significance? Therefore, according to the opinions of French aviation experts, this invention can not only advance aviation but also create a new revolution in the history of flight.</p>
<h3>Mr. Village Chief (19)</h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Wen this time pretended to be an expert, nodding his head, responding with (Hum! Uh! Hum! Uh!) "Is this the village chief! If I can't come up with a solution, I have to pretend to (approve)!" he thought. Then he opened his mouth and spoke to the squad leader.</p>
<p>"(Squad leader!)" The awkward situation that Mr. Feng Wen had unintentionally shown earlier due to not being able to provide supplies was now completely gone. The sound of his voice was also strangely loud. "(I think I, the village chief, have done my best. Isn't that right? Initially, there was a person called A-Zhao who was willing to go, so I raised donations for him, giving him twenty yuan a month. I said that if anyone else was willing to go, I would definitely donate the same amount. But still, no one went. Now, the people in the village can't blame me, the village chief, anymore. Squad leader, go ahead and arrest them boldly. At that time, they won't be able to complain about me. But, but..." Village Chief Feng Wen said, also bringing his mouth close to the squad leader's ear, and told him the same thing that Mr. Dasheng had told him.</p>
<p>"(That's good, let us go and take action first.)" The squad leader stood up. A bright idea flashed through his mind, foreseeing the opportunity to make money had arrived. He puffed out his chest, saying with full spirit, "(After we get our hands on them, it won't be too late to come back for lunch!) Brothers, follow me."</p>
<p>The squad leader waved his hand. The brothers in yellow military uniforms, who had been sticking to the corners of the wall like shadows, finally exhaled and stood up. These brothers in arms had been conscripted from various villages not long ago. When they were listening to Dong Sheng's lame-handed report, some of them couldn't help but feel heartbroken, reminiscing about their own homes. The squad leader asked them to arrest people, but they couldn't muster any enthusiasm. However, they still had to go out.</p>
<p>Mr. Dasheng then also returned to his shop. He sat at the accounting table again, shaking his legs.</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Market: U.S. Reduces Silver Reserves, Speculation of Price Increase by Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>(Rumors Abound, Changes Rapid, Once Passing 940 Yuan)</p>
<p>The gold market experienced rapid changes yesterday. Market rumors were rampant, mainly due to speculation that the U.S. was tightening silver reserves. Prices once exceeded the 940 yuan mark. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed no changes in London, and both British and American markets were flat. The price of spot gold in London also remained unchanged. Exchange rate fluctuations were minimal. American cotton and wheat prices experienced significant declines. Stock market fluctuations were minimal. Reports indicated that Turkey would start minting silver coins, but this had little impact. However, off-exchange trading initially fell to 26.1 yuan due to unfavorable news for short positions. Due to numerous rumors of a reduction in dollar silver purchases, a buying frenzy emerged at low prices, causing a rebound of over eight yuan in an instant. After the market opened, prices slightly decreased due to banks selling and hedging activities, but the 930 yuan level was not breached. Market sentiment remained strong, with occasional buying frenzies. When the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) significantly reduced its British and American exchange rates, domestic traders aggressively pushed prices higher, leading to a sudden tightening. A cable reported that the U.S. government, recognizing the significant impact of rapidly rising silver prices on China since the implementation of its silver policy, would reduce silver purchases to avoid harming China. (Previously, the ratio of gold to silver reserves was set at three to one, but now the silver reserve ratio will be reduced.) Short positions, already under pressure, were hesitant to act. Buyers became even more excited, fueling the upward trend. Although there was some resistance, the demand in the market far exceeded supply, reaching an extreme point. Prices once exceeded the 940 yuan mark. At higher prices, supply became more abundant, and banks also sold at higher prices. The market then turned downward, but sentiment remained stable. The exchange rate market suddenly loosened at noon, showing a decline. After the market closed, reports indicated that the heads of the joint association had visited Minister Kong, who stated that the government had decided not to increase silver export taxes for the sake of foreign trade, leading to continued weakness. The after-market was initially subdued due to the after-effects of the midday close. The domestic market hardened, and with unstable sentiment, the price retreated into the 930 yuan level. Sassoon Securities bought shillings, and the initial telegraph from Mumbai showed a decrease of 3.4.5 anna, but then rebounded to above 930 yuan. Although sentiment weakened later, banks bought after selling, and the gold market entered a fluctuating pattern, hovering around 930 yuan. Finally, Mumbai fell 1.2 anna, showing a slight sign of stability. The day's market situation was volatile, and market sentiment was extremely panicked.

<h3>The Yarn Flower Yarn Market Is Out of Control</h3>
<p>Recently Broke Through the 70 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken, and the price decline was still fierce, because there were ample chips on the table, and the overseas cotton industry situation was declining, so the amount of foreign firms selling short not only did not cover, but added to the selling on rallies, therefore, the market was even more difficult to support, judging from the market situation, the yarn market could not be optimistic, this month has already broken through the 170 yuan mark,</p>

<h3>Cotton Prices Initially Rise, Ultimately Fall</h3>
<p>The cotton market’s downturn is gradually taking hold, influenced by falling US cotton prices, raising concerns about breaking through the 12.2-cent level. This has softened market sentiment, compounded by continuous declines in the yarn market. Bullish firms are holding firm, keeping October prices high, which also constrains longer-term contracts. However, cotton prices are already higher than yarn prices, making future developments difficult to predict.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Small Two Triangle)  Biao cotton market opened with US cotton prices down, but bullish firms continued to absorb the supply, maintaining tightness in the market. The second session remained high, pushing up to three at closing. Due to the yarn market’s inability to sustain, a significant downturn began, resulting in declines of 5 to 7 cents across all months. The afternoon session opened weakly, with some profit-taking to offset short positions, leading to a tighter close, with nearby months down 10 cents and distant months up 5 to 10 cents. The total volume traded for the day was 159,400 dan. Sales included Renfeng 3,300 dan, Huikang 5,800 dan, Daji 1,500 dan, Tongji 4,300 dan, Gengfeng 4,400 dan, Yuanse 2,000 dan, Changfeng 6,500 dan, Xiecheng 2,800 dan, Xiesheng 8,100 dan, Tonghe 1,400 dan, and Xincheng 3,100 dan.

As a result, spot prices fell 10 points and futures fell 9 to 12 points. UK cotton futures rose 2-3 points. Indian cotton rose due to buying by European exporters and speculators, resulting in Pingor rising 2.5 rupees and Omra and Bai Luo Creek each rising 1.25 rupees (from the 3rd).</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened with a soft tone in the morning, then strengthened.  Overseas wheat quotations showed Chicago down about $1.10 and Canada down about 90 cents.  When the market opened, continuous large declines in foreign wheat prices suggested potential dumping in the future, causing concern among both industry insiders and outsiders.  This led to an opening price for the current month of 2.1475 yuan, significantly lower.  However, forward contracts were unaffected because factories, after the exchange implemented cash transactions for both parties, were unwilling to engage in hedging.  This effectively reduced the volume of sell orders in the market, making it more susceptible to fluctuations.  The market's recovery from weakness was largely due to this factor.  In the afternoon session, the current month saw slight spot transactions involving Yingkou and other regions, while new buyers gradually entered the forward market.  Factories also stopped selling off their stocks, leading to a gradual strengthening of both nearby and distant contracts.  Although the environment had improved, if foreign wheat prices continued to decline, future movements were likely to change.  As a result, the current month rose 4 cents from the previous day, November rose 6.25 cents, December rose 5.25 cents, January rose 4.5 cents, and February rose 4.75 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market opened with a dip in the morning, then stabilized. Overseas wheat quotations showed Chicago down about $1.10 and Canada down about 90 cents.  When the market opened, both nearby and distant contracts were weak, falling about 2-4 cents from the previous day's closing price.  Later in the session, the flour market's recovery boosted market sentiment, and in the afternoon session, news of the flour market's rebound and rumors of an upcoming silver tax led to a sharp rise in prices.  The current market is driven both by real price fluctuations and by active speculation. As a result, the current month rose 5 cents from the previous day, November rose 7 cents, December rose 11 cents, January rose 9 cents, and February rose 7 cents.  Spot wheat sales remained stagnant as factories continued to hold their positions.</p>

<h3>New Rice Arrives and Becomes Increasingly Popular</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Fall Again by 2-3 Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai)  Yesterday, supplies from various regions were similar, totaling about 17-18 shipments (nearly 3,000 piculs).  Most of it was new rice, with limited sales, leading to cautious sentiment towards new rice. Consequently, sales were slow, and local demand was minimal, causing a continued price decline.  After repeated drops, Qingdao and Yantai merchants, seeing that prices were difficult to match, considered trying new rice due to its accumulated price drops, purchasing over 200 bags. This allowed the entire stock to be sold, though prices fell by 2-3 cents.  At the same time, *baige* rice was able to stabilize slightly, with only a 2-inch discount.  However, new *jing* rice saw only limited local demand and a sharp drop of 3-4 cents.  Only new *duyang jian*, *lingbai jian*, and *baijian* rice, relying on already low prices, sold relatively well, giving the market a slightly softer tone. All other types of polished rice fell by 2-3 cents, resulting in a seemingly chaotic and uneven market. *Bianyuan* also fell sharply, with the new *yinyuan* depreciating beyond 1 cent.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 31-32 shipments arrived from downstream. The market was mixed, with sales of *baixi*, polished western *xinjing* rice faring slightly better. Very little new *yangjian du* arrived, and retail sales were acceptable. Retail sales of *yin bianyuan* remained sluggish. Market prices for polished *jing* rice were slightly less than 1 cent higher, western *xinjing* rice was priced higher, with medium and lower grades about 1 cent higher. Prices for other varieties, such as *yin yuan* and old *ke jian*, were similar to previous market levels.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Philippine Galvanized Iron Expected to Arrive</h3>
<p>Since the galvanized iron market in this city has been trending upwards, with limited supply and strong demand, buyers have expressed regret at not being able to purchase. Recently, it was heard that a certain foreign firm, as an importer, is actively purchasing from the Philippines to adjust the market. It is said that a telegram arrived yesterday stating that 30,000 to 40,000 sheets of spot goods would be shipped within a week, so there should be no concerns about a shortage in Shanghai in the future.</p>

<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Making a Living Selling to the Common People, Returning to Yongchou to Seek Other Opportunities, Heavenly People Arrive in Chang'an</p>
<p>Li Shilian nodded his lips and said, "Lo! He's the one I ran into at the Xianyang ferry." The two of them stopped and watched what he would do. Behind him were two women, one middle-aged and one elderly. This alone matched what Jia Duocai had said. The three of them stood on the sidewalk under a poplar tree, staring blankly at the people coming and going on the street. The middle-aged woman said, "This place is so prosperous, no wonder Qiao'er's father didn't want to come home after he went out. It's strange, why are these lights so bright?" The girl said, "Mom, Grandma, have you seen? That store over there has bright glass windows, and you can see everything inside, all colorful, it's really pretty." The middle-aged woman said, "I even saw a store with floors above floors, taller than a Buddhist temple, Xi'an is really bustling." Jia Duocai laughed, "Old Li, did you hear that? They say this is a good place." As he spoke, he crossed the street and walked up to them. The girl recognized him first in the lamplight, tilting her head and staring, but pulling on the middle-aged woman's sleeve. The old woman said to Jia Duocai, "You've arrived too, sir. Thank you for giving us two dollars in Binzhou." Jia Duocai didn't expect that their first sentence would expose his secrets, and he couldn't help but blush, "I only saw that you looked pitiful, so I spent two dollars to send you off. As long as I have money on hand, I often do good deeds, so I don't mind giving you two dollars, there's no need to thank me." The two women didn't expect that thanking someone would make them unhappy, and stood there awkwardly, unable to say anything. (33)</p>
<h3>Tea at Huangdang River</h3>
<p>— Qingbin</p>
<p>The Huangdang River is worthy of being called great. Although it is called a river, it has the aura of a lake. It is very similar to the West Lake in Hangzhou. Therefore, the river has quite a reputation. It is the main stream of Haining and Haiyan.</p>
<p>The cruel drought has befallen, and even the great river is drying up in disaster. What used to have dozens of feet of water now has the riverbed exposed. Heavenly disasters are such cruel punishments! It is said that tea shops were opened there during the drought of Xianfeng year six, and this saying still lingers in the ears of the elderly. This year, the villagers there have actually opened tea shops by the river, making a painful commemoration of the eighty years.</p>
<p>"Let's go to the Huangdang River for tea" has become the most powerful saying in the market, and has become the center of play for both young and old. The petty bourgeoisie always likes leisure, and cannot forget entertainment even in disaster. So the tea drinkers are very lively. I was also tempted and made an appointment with a friend to go. The journey is about eight or nine li, and we could walk, but he felt weak, so we hired a small boat. It is usually most embarrassing to ride a small boat. The riverbed is only a few inches deep, making it very difficult to move forward, and the sun is very hot, causing a headache. But thinking back, we were lucky. There were many farmers on the fields on both sides of the riverbank who were drawing water. It was really hard work under such a hot sun. There were many fields along the long riverbank, but only one machine was seen for water pumping. The equipment for farming is so poor. Seeing the facts, equipment and natural disasters are closely linked.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Huangdang River, it was already crowded. The tea shop was set up by the river, leaving only a small mud ditch in the center. Various snacks that are never seen in the countryside are now set up here. Everyone was looking at the river and talking about the drought. Among the many tea drinkers, there was an old man of ninety-six. He said:</p>
<p>"Tea shops were opened here in the sixth year of Xianfeng, but it rained heavily after only three days, and the river was full. This year, it has been open for eleven days, and there is only a drizzle." His words seemed to imply that there was a connection between rain and opening a tea shop. The old man spoke eloquently, attracting everyone's attention. There is a Changshan Bridge by the river, with twenty-seven arches. Although it is not as majestic as the Treasure Belt Bridge, it is rare in western Zhejiang. We originally planned to go and see the withered fields, but dark clouds hung high in the sky, so we hurried back. The wind was very strong on the way, and the waves rose and fell with the wind, and the bottom of the river could be seen at any time. The wind blew harder and harder, and the clouds became darker and lower. In the boat, we were really worried about the arrival of a sudden storm.</p>
<h3>Droplets</h3>
<p>— (Yiyiguanzhu)</p>
<p>A single spark can start a prairie fire. A small stream, if not stopped, can become a river. You must know that "sparks" are "drops." "Streams" are "trickles." Looking at it this way, the world may be big, but there's really nothing surprising about it. "Drops" (a double meaning) may be small, but they shouldn't be ignored!</p>
<p>This summer, when the plum rains began, not a single drop of rain fell, causing drought and famine everywhere! And since autumn began, it has been dripping and drizzling non-stop, and everyone is cursing! From this, it can be seen that making "drops" (a double meaning) is not easy!</p>
<h3>The Scented Imperial Records</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At that time, the only botanist in the palace was almost unable to rest all day, always standing in front of the Empress Dowager, waiting for her questions, because the rain was very scarce along this route, and most of it was fields overgrown with flowers and plants, which the Empress Dowager was very happy to see, so her questions came out one after another.</p>
<p>Along the way, we passed a long river somewhere nearby with water as clear as a mirror and without any large waves. In ordinary days, this might be a very important waterway, but at this time, it was quiet and no ships were seen, because the location of this river was too close to the route the Empress Dowager was taking, and a temporary ban on traffic had been implemented to ensure thorough protection. However, the river itself did not lose its luster due to the lack of ships! The Empress Dowager was very happy to see it. Indeed, in the vast fields, such a green river dotted the landscape, like a wonderful landscape painting. But upon closer inspection, this river was probably not so moving originally, and someone must have come to tidy it up beforehand, especially the trees on both sides of the river. (143)</p>
<h3>Appreciation of the Countryside</h3>
<h3>Talking About Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Shaou</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Industry's recent announcement, the national consumption of cigarettes is 400 million yuan per year. This is indeed an alarming number. Incidentally, I looked up the Shanghai Yearbook under the "Finance" section and found that this number is more than 23 times greater than the total annual recurring expenses for education and culture nationwide. If everyone in the country who is accustomed to smoking cigarettes were to throw away their cigarette butts, it would be enough to cover the entire annual recurring expenses for the national army, navy, and air force with some left over. Alternatively, it would be enough to purchase 4,000 airplanes as big as the "Tianchu Hao" (referring to a large airplane).</p>
<p>From cigarettes to opium, in terms of their actual utility, they cannot satisfy hunger, quench thirst, keep warm in winter, or cool off in summer. They certainly fall into the category of unnecessary consumption. However, there is no shortage of cigarette advocates in the world, and they have some philosophical insights, regarding cigarettes as necessities as indispensable as rice, water, and fire. They believe that cigarettes can be used to refresh oneself when tired, calm oneself when angry, relax after meals, and mask odors when using the toilet. Writers can rely on them to stimulate literary ideas, workers can take a break from their busy schedules and rest briefly. In social settings, they can be used to introduce oneself and communicate after initial greetings. ...In the moment of smoking, one can even exhale clouds of vapor from the mouth and nostrils, and look down on everything. A cigarette can resolve disputes and create equality between enemies and relatives. It can help the frustrated eliminate all worries and enter a state of tranquility.</p>
<p>If cigarettes were to be banned as strictly as opium, not only would the national finances lose 50 million yuan in cigarette tax revenue annually, but millions of farmers and workers in tobacco farms and factories would suffer unemployment. More importantly, it would be a significant loss in terms of culture and people's lives. The annual consumption of 400 million yuan in cigarettes is still not worth worrying about.</p>

<h3>A Song of Troubles Blowing from All Directions</h3>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>Still so young, so many other things to write about, yet insisting on writing about "farewell," which is so depressing, seems a bit immature! The earth is round, "where in life do we not meet?" But then, I must console myself! People, after all, are not stones, not wood.</p>
<p>In recent years, since I went through what seemed to be a heartbreak, my heart has become much quieter! As quiet as an ancient well, it seems that no waves will rise again! Friends have comforted me, telling me not to dwell on her, to regard her as a spring dream...to regard her as...an autumn flower... fortunately, we only met by chance. I am thinking as my friends have said.</p>
<p>"Love is ultimately an elusive thing, while friendship is great and everlasting." At first, I didn't believe this, but now, I don't know why, I can't help but tacitly acknowledge that these words are true! Kui...is one of my best and most trusted friends in this vast universe. "To have one confidant is enough." Now, this confidant is leaving Shanghai to go to his Eastern Chicago, Hankou!</p>
<p>The day of our farewell was rainy and windy. I accompanied him all over the three major companies and all over the major department stores on Nanjing Road. He bought a lot of things to eat, play with, and use, filling a whole basket, until 10 o'clock in the evening, we lazily boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianguo wheel.</p>
<p>Once on board, Kui said to me, "It's getting late! You've worked hard for me today! You've been running around all day for me, and your feet haven't stopped. I really feel bad. Now, I'm bothering you to send me to the ship alone, I really must ask you to go back early! Otherwise, there may not be any trams left!"</p>
<p>"What's this?" I only said this one sentence, and tears almost welled up in my eyes. "Helping close friends is my duty, and suffering for close friends, though bitter, is something I don't mind. Suffering for close friends is only physical, and the time when I suffer the most on the body is precisely the time when I have the greatest comfort in my soul!" These thoughts swirled through my mind, and the cabin fell silent!</p>
<p>"I feel so sad...we've known each other for a year and have never been apart! Now I'm going to taste the bitterness of parting!" Kui paused for a long while, and finally said this sentence to break the gloomy atmosphere and asked me.</p>
<p>"The moon has its waxing and waning, people have their joys and sorrows, and there is no unending banquet in the world, so what can we do?" I replied to him.</p>
<p>We both fell silent again!</p>
<p>It was Kui who urged me to leave, with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>I saw that there was no point in lingering any longer! Only then did I step onto the pier with heavy steps.</p>
<p>At the pier, as we tightly gripped our hands in parting, Kui suddenly said to me, "Didn't Ryunosuke Akutagawa say something like this? 'To save us from love, it is better to be busy than to use reason.' I am now merely changing it to 'To save us from farewell, it is better to be busy than to use reason.' What do you think?"</p>
<p>I nodded and said a loud "Take care," and it wasn't until our shadows were swallowed up by the tall buildings standing on the shore that I returned to my ancient-temple-like abode with a "sad heart" in the deep night.</p>
<p>Farewell, it has now been more than a month!</p>

<h3>Talking About Animal Day</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The fourth of this month is World Animal Day. Therefore, the China Animal Protection Association, in order to promote the concept of animal protection among members of society, has obtained permission from the authorities to instruct all butchers and slaughterhouses to prohibit slaughtering for one day. And on this day, it will hold an Animal Day publicity conference at the Chamber of Commerce, inviting celebrities to guide speeches, followed by entertainment. The wonderful program includes a song and dance by a certain girls' school, a animal protection song composed by Li Jinhui and sung by Ms. Li Mingjian. Newspapers such as the Xinwen Bao, the Buddhist Monthly, and the Animal Protection Newspaper will also publish special editions.</p>
<p>In this era, when human life is as cheap as dogs and pigs, and people are too busy to deal with human affairs, there are still many compassionate people who extend their kindness to animals. This is truly worth celebrating. Moreover, judging from the scale of the event, it puts many commemorative days such as "Women's Day" and "Children's Day" to shame. It truly makes one sigh that "people are not as good as animals."</p>
<p>There are quite a few people in the world who are extraordinarily talented and skilled in magic. Their skills are truly amazing and admirable. Hitler is doing his best to shout about "promoting reproduction" and "eliminating reproductive function." This method is inexplicably driving people into militarism. Roosevelt's Blue Eagle movement and recovery plan are blowing the entire social property into the pockets of financial giants. As for the natural disasters and man-made disasters where human lives are like ants, in the eyes of some people, it truly causes a sense of "discomfort." Afraid of demons rising from the bloodbath, they do not hesitate to promote "respect for animal life" with the appeal of singers and dancers, so as to make people calmly forget the reality of the environment and forget the atmosphere of bloody storm.</p>
<p>Foreign countries call it "magic," while China calls it "tricks." Although there is a difference between advanced and backward, don't we even know that much?</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Stepping into the kindergarten of XX Elementary School, a swarm of children like bees rushed towards me. They clamored noisily…</p>
<p>"(Mr.) He! (Mr.) He!" They surrounded me in a large circle, and then they began their original magic trick.</p>
<p>You hold my hand, I hold his hand, he holds his hand, and we jump and sing… "(The peach blossoms are red, the pear blossoms are white, the rose blossoms are intoxicating, flowers in front, flowers behind, springtime arrives at my home. Wearing cherry blossoms, adorned with orchids, holding crabapple blossoms, embracing apricot blossoms, flowers on the left, flowers on the right, the beauty of spring is hard to depict! …)"</p>
<p>At this moment, a child tripped, and they all laughed heartily.</p>
<p>I helped the child up, and she said to me with a pouting mouth, as if she wanted to cry… "(Mr.) He! Did… … did you not buy candy for me?"</p>
<p>"(Candy, I want some too)!" another shouted. "(Me too)," yet another shouted. "(Me too)!" They surrounded me tightly again, some pulling at the corner of my clothes, some hugging my legs, some holding my hands, while some put their hands into my pockets to search, but they were very disappointed. One of them said to me…</p>
<p>"(Mr.) He is bad! (Mr.) He didn't give me candy to eat. I… … I don't want to be… … friends with (Mr.) He." And then she ran away.</p>
<p>"(Mr.) He is bad, I… … I don't want to be friends with (Mr.) He either. I'm going to call (Mr.) Li to buy candy." And then she ran away too.</p>
<p>"(Everyone go! Everyone go! (Mr.) He doesn't have candy, (Mr.) Li has candy, everyone go! Everyone go!)" And then one after another, they all ran away.</p>
<p>At this moment, I thought to myself… how innocent, pure, ignorant, and adorable children are! They live in a</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>a carefree environment, following human nature, they are just how they are. They have no worries, no , no thoughts. They are not infected by all the bad ideas in society. Their hearts are pure and joyful. How happy children's lives are.</p>
<p>At this moment, I was touched, so I ran into the classroom. Life, life, adult life, mechanical life, gradually numbs people's nerves. My heart has much less interest in the painted faces of life than before.</p>
<p>This heart is healed by the feelings of children, so I can barely keep living.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the children who were sitting in a large circle around me, I clapped my hands and said to them… "(Little friends, little friends, please don't be angry with me. I'll slowly call for candy to be bought for you to eat, would you like that?"</p>
<p>"(Yes)! (Yes)!" Countless identical voices shouted in succession.</p>
<p>At this moment, I thought again… children are easily deceived, precisely because of this, children are ignorant, so they are even more lovable. So I said to them again… "(Now, would you like to hear an interesting story first?"</p>
<p>"(Yes)!" another identical exclamation came.</p>
<p>In this way, I began to tell them about the lives of poor children, and the lives of wandering children.</p>
<h3>Autumn Wind and Yellow Leaves Picture</h3>
<h3>Riding a Bike</h3>
<p>— HY</p>
<p>After playing in the countryside for an afternoon, the head, which was made very painful by the car, regained its original state, and I felt very happy spiritually.</p>
<p>In particular, riding bicycles with my friends and speeding across the fields increased my interest a lot.</p>
<p>Speaking of learning to ride a bicycle, it was still when I was in Wusong, before I left school life. That was before January 28th. Every day after dinner, when I had nothing to do, I would go to the bicycle shop to rent a bike and learn in the open space by the sea. There were three people learning to ride a bike together: Zhang, Sha, and myself. Now, time has passed and circumstances have changed, and changes in people are hard to predict. I left school and lived in a garret in Shanghai. Zhang, because he was implicated by others, is still imprisoned and has no freedom. Sha returned to her parents' home in her hometown, and there has been no news from her. This unpleasant memory came to my mind when I first stepped on a bicycle.</p>
<p>"(What's wrong? What are you thinking about?)"</p>
<p>My friend saw my expression and asked.</p>
<p>"(Nothing, but I was thinking about the time two years ago when I learned to ride a bike with Zhang and Sha by the sea in Wusong.)"</p>
<p>"(The past is unbearable to recall. At that time, weren't we all very happy, and didn't we have a good time! Now, now we can't even bring it up. Like us subjugated people, all we can do all day long is endure hardship and barely survive, and we dare not think about any hope.)"</p>
<p>"(Yes, I feel that way too.)"</p>
<p>I just perfunctorily said this, and we rode away. I didn't want to say more, for fear of causing his , which would make our outing unpleasant.</p>
<p>The sun was shining, and the heat of the autumn tiger was indeed scorching. The wind was blowing in our faces, helping us dissipate the evaporation of hot sweat. We walked along some small roads paved with gravel, we also walked along some cinder roads, and we also walked along some grassy paths. Thatched cottages, burial mounds, fields, and rivers hurriedly ran towards us and quickly rushed past us, turning them all into moving things.</p>
<p>On the road, the air was so fresh, with not a hint of bad smell, and no flying dust to be seen. It was very peaceful, and no noisy sounds could be heard. The countryside, the lovely countryside, is so superior to the dark and gloomy city! I was a child who grew up in the countryside. Although I am now a parasite in the city, I am always longing for the countryside. Regardless of boundaries, whether it is the south or the north, as long as it is the countryside, it is always quieter and more lovely than the city.</p>
<p>Gradually, we got tired of riding, and the wind was not strong enough to blow away the hot sweat on our bodies, so we got off the bikes and sat on the ridges of the fields by the roadside to rest.</p>
<p>Near the door of a nearby farmhouse, a little white dog, probably not liking the look of us two strangers, barked incessantly. The barking of the chickens also followed. My friend looked at</p>
<p>"(Let's go, let's not disturb the chickens and dogs.)"</p>
<p>We rode our bikes again, slowly riding along on our way home.</p>
<h3>Pigeons of Beiping</h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>In Shanghai, as soon as the east turns white, you can hear the (whoosh, whoosh…) sound of steam whistles coming from factories far and near. This sound, so sharp and dirty, stabbing into the eardrums of people who are in the midst of sweet dreams, is so annoying. However, this is a whip, an order to tens of thousands of manual laborers who are exhausted from working all day, who cannot be even a little bit late or lazy, but must quickly get up and continue the same work they did yesterday, the day before yesterday, …</p>
<p>In Beiping, the land of emperors, perhaps because it is to be a "cultural city," this strange noise that disturbs sweet dreams is never heard. However, it is not as quiet as people imagine the ancient city to be. In the early morning, you can hear the (wawa, wawa…) sound blowing over from the vast sky. This sound, to someone who has just arrived in Beiping, might also bring to mind car horns… But if he is willing to lie in his cotton quilt, with his ears open, and carefully listen quietly for a few early mornings, he will not suspect that it is acting as a whip and an order.</p>
<p>If you can get up very early, just walk slowly onto the cold streets, look up into the sky, and you can see groups of white pigeons leisurely soaring in the vast sky. They circle around there, gradually rising, and then gradually falling… The clear and loud (wawa, wawa…) sound also gradually weakens and gradually becomes louder with their rising and falling. Carefully savoring this scene for a while, the doubts of many days can be clearly resolved at this time.</p>
<p>, the pigeon has a sound device under its wings (I still don't understand what the sound device looks like). It relies on the force of the wind from the pigeon's flapping wings to make a sound. The sole purpose of this is to provide the owner with something to listen to for fun. In fact, this way of playing is quite elegant and clever… Whether it is morning or evening, you can see pigeons circling and soaring in the sky in a regular pattern, and you can hear rhythmic music lingering in your ears. If you compare this to the many refined people in the south who often keep little sparrows that have come here in a small cage, it is really too much.</p>

<h3>Uncle's Braid (23)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>"(But you had to be the most righteous and mess with the Boxers. Wasn't the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance enough of a loss?)" The third son also had a point.</p>
<p>"(It's wrong, that's for sure)," the eldest son said again… "(But it's clearly written out that they don't dare to fight foreigners. Don't you think that's so embarrassing?)"</p>
<p>Zhi Zhai never participated in the discussion, but just ate his meal silently. However, he felt that Li Yuanhong's character was still acceptable, but Yuan Shikai was the least brave. According to the newspapers, Yuan Shikai telegraphed his opinion, saying that the government troops should postpone their attack and quickly discuss a reconciliation with the revolutionaries. He also said that if it was unavoidable, he would personally go to Wuchang for face-to-face discussions. In this way, he was simply colluding with the revolutionaries. How could a country not perish if the Qing court let traitors lead the troops?</p>
<p>After dinner, the table was also wiped clean. Shi Min knelt on the stool next to the table, watching his second uncle take out many combs, bone needles, face powder, hair ties, and other things from the box. Her aunt stood beside Shi Min, also very happy. She looked at each green onion grass flower and each needle very carefully, and asked clearly about the price of each item. When her eldest sister-in-law came with a wet towel to wash her son's face, she also watched from afar with her big belly, because it was not convenient for sisters-in-law to talk too much, so she really wanted to know the price of that very large peony flower, but she never opened her mouth. Later, the eldest sister-in-law and younger sister each received a share. Each person had as many as six pieces, including two bundles of foreign hair ties. Shi Min was also assigned a mud bodhisattva with a head that could shake and a small blue basket, which she was really very happy with, and she was still playing with it when she went to bed. Only her mother quietly said in her husband's ear when she went to bed…</p>
<p>"(I don't know how many things he kept for his wife.)" (End)</p>

<h3>Opening (Jia Yuanchun)</h3>
<p>Heavenly incense candles and peony red. Spoiled Crown Chao Yang's first palace. Parents return home, God's grace is great. Feng Shao issued an edict from the ninth heaven. Visiting relatives. Extremely ingenious structure. Yunlin stone. Wonderful and exquisite. A building every five steps, a pavilion every ten steps. (Also) Xiaoxiang Hengwu and Yihong. Censer incense curls. Candlelight is red. From time to time I hear celestial cranes chirping in the long sky. (Waiting until) the setting sun sinks to the west and the ice wheel appears. The servants at the door descend from Luan and close the city gates. (Speaking) The empress rises up from the Daming Palace. The two mansions, Rong and Ning, knelt to welcome her. The old emperor received her in the inner hall. (The empress) sorrowfully holds the lady's hand. Jade wrist gently supports the old ancestor. (I just thought) it would be difficult to see each other again after entering the Changmen. Thanks to God's grace, flesh and blood meet again. (See) the garden's couplets are elegant. Knowing that Baoyu is young and his learning is vast. Caged in the hermitage, praying reverently to Buddha. The wonderful nun strikes the drum and rings the bell. The watchtower is urging. The words are hasty. Before leaving home, tears fill her chest. Forcibly putting on a brave face and returning to the palace. The old emperor fell down in the inner hall crying. Returning to the palace, he issued an edict. (Teach) Poetry sisters live in the garden. Do not fail the green willows and red peach blossoms year after year.</p>
