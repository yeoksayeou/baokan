<p>時評</p>
<h3>法俄軍事同盟説　恒</h3>
<p>昨日倫敦電稱。法俄軍事恊定。已於上月二十二日正式成立。其要點（一）</p>
<p>爲兩國在軍事技術及製造上互相合作。（二）爲以德日爲假想敵而謀共同</p>
<p>應付。廻憶上月二十四日巴黎電。急進社會黨議員阿香波曾聲稱。法俄間已成立防守同盟。德法間一旦有事。蘇俄必爲法國聲援。一時國際空氣。極爱動盪。法國政府方面。對此旋卽加以否認。内幕究竟如何。當時實不得而知。不謂事將一月。而英報又言之鑿鑿。可見多數人已信其中必有相當之眞實性也。　　今法人乃又有否認之表示。然我人但就事實加以推敲。則似覺法國實有與俄締結此種同盟之可能。（一）爲法國對德。具有歷史的恐怖心理。故不</p>
<p>論已方軍備之如何優越。同情之如何衆多。總覺其自身之尙未安全。法人心理上對於已方實力。旣缺乏自信。則自以多結實力雄厚之與國爲得計。（二）則自法俄發起東歐公約以來。波蘭以不欲俄軍之假道。始終無贊助之表示。德國欲以軍備平等爲交換。不願爲無條件之接受。英國則僅以從旁勸導各方爲止境。至於成與不成。亦不負任何責任。是以東歐公約醖釀半年有餘。迄無所成。形勢如此。則捨法俄雙方作更進一步之行動。自無法以促成東歐公約之實現。（三）則法意之携手。近雖積極進行。然雙方之難題甚多。究竟能否底於全然妥恊之境。實尙在未定之天。（四）則法俄軍事恊定成則卽使東歐公約不能實現。而在事實上則已獲有該約多少之效用再觀此一軍事恊定之内容。僅着重軍事人才之交換。軍火之互相接濟而於蘇俄出兵恊攻德國</p>
<p>一點。則並未提及。此點似爲法國重謀聯絡波蘭之地步蓋如此則波蘭可免俄軍過境之虞。故此一恊定成後。波蘭或能改變其對法態度亦未可知有此</p>
<p>數因。可知法俄間有訂立此項恊定之傳説。或非出諸偶然也</p>
<p>假使此項恊定。而果有成。則其影響所及。必不僅限於歐洲蓋據該恊定第四條規定。如蘇俄遭日本之攻擊。則法國立卽供給軍火與俄云云於此可知日俄果一旦有事。勢必牽涉法國。蓋法旣不守局外中立而以軍火供給蘇俄則日本自有充分理由以在法之安南啟釁也。前此外電曾謂法國唯恐開罪</p>
<p>日本。故不願與俄締結牽涉遠東戰端之恊定。則今次法國對與俄軍事同盟之説仍加否認。其意義或卽在是歟。</p>
<h3>美參議院反對開鑿尼加拉圭運河</h3>
<p>以其利沿海各州而害内地</p>
<p>參院兩洋運河委員會委員克拉克今日表示反對開鑿尼加拉圭運河、克氏宣稱、此種計劃將使美國沿海各州之發展大得助力、而有害於内地各州云、按開浚尼加拉圭運河之議係本星期衆議院海軍委員會主席文生氏所主張、謂將在國會提出云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本樞府會議</h3>
<p>决定廢棄海軍約</p>
<p>打破太平洋上均勢</p>
<p>稱霸遠東野心若揭</p>
<p>美暫不願表示意見</p>
<p>（東京）　今晨樞密院舉行御前全會、一致贊助日政府廢止華盛頓海軍公約之决議、聞廢止該約之正式照會、須俟耶誕節休假期後送交美國務院、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　廢棄華府條約之諮詢案、今日通過樞府本會、故政府卽日請求發下該案、附議明日閣議、决定後、岡田首相卽奏請裁准、於二十二日上午由廣田外相電命齊藤駐美大使、囑向美國政府通告、故齊藤大使將觀察情形後、將該通告面交美國政府、如能順利進行、可於二十二日内</p>
<p>實行、至遲在聖誕節後之二十七日、當可完畢一切手續（十九日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　政府將廢棄華府條約之通告、遞寄齊藤駐美大使、一面並擬簡單闡明廢約之主旨、惟須觀倫敦談話休會後之變化情形、再變更預定、但决將廢棄通告之理由向内外闡明、原文已由外務海軍兩省商榷、文長一千二百餘字、（十九日電通電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院官員對於日本樞密院正式核准廢棄一九二三年之華盛頓海軍條約、不願發表意見、茲悉在未於此間外交途徑接得正式廢約照會之前、不致發表何種宣言、但接近政府之發言人非正式宣稱、日本之行動將視爲擾亂維持太平洋安全之政治及海軍條約制度、而廢棄條約亦可視爲太平洋有關各國競造戰艦之先聲、據此間視察者之意見、如日本於廢棄華盛頓條約後獲得與英美平等之海軍、則日本將足以獨覇遠東、是曥大部份西方人現有之勢力將歸消滅、而歐美各國在亞洲獲得之歷史的權利、如中國之開放門户政策等亦將感受危害矣、（十九國民電）</p>
<h3>海軍談判將休會</h3>
<p>日方最後努力</p>
<p>要求規定重開日期</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美代表雖已接奉華盛頓回訓、允照英國方案暫停三國海軍談話、但日代表現猶作最後之努力、擬决定復開討論之日期、按照英國方案、關於此問題之手續將由英國酌定之、美代表台維斯今日告日代表松平、美國態度未變、以爲日本之廢止華盛頓條約使談判中止、須俟有新事件討論時、方可要求談話復開、松平答稱、日本主張插入談話復開之切實日期云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國變更中立原則</h3>
<p>用意在制服日本</p>
<p>一方足以增强國聯力量</p>
<p>一方取悦於英俾獲聲援</p>
<p>與主要外交策絶不背馳</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　國務院準備向羅斯福總統提出建議案、主張將美國中立原則完全加以修改、而定一新原則、此事已見前日電、頃國務卿赫爾加以證實、但又謂外間有美國將放棄其傳統海上自由原則之説、實則「全爲臆斷」云云、據若干方面意見、以後如遇其他國家發生戰爭時、美國大總統或可宣布美國船舶如冒險航行於交戰區域、以及美國軍火商人如與交戰國家交易、其所能遭遇之危險、由該船舶及商人自負其責、美國政府不復予以援助、此種政策、一方可使美國與國聯會合作、一方可使英法滿意、蓋國聯會如對某一國家實行封鎖時、卽無須顧慮美國、至於英法方面、素謂美國完全保守中立、足以阻礙國聯會之努力、今美國改變原則、則形勢爲之一變矣、華盛頓政府之改變原則、與海會談話不能無關、緣日本對海軍之要求、不屈不撓、美國以爲如欲折服日本、非得英國或者蘇俄之援助不爲功、中立原則之變更、卽在取悦英國、使之爲美聲援也、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　凡屬世界最强大之國家、苟欲規避責任、始終孤立、則欲本國及全世界均能避免最嚴重之後果、在勢實不可能、羅斯福總統最近主張修改中立原則、其所以曉諭美國人民者、卽在乎此、羅斯福總統現正準備、使美國解决各項國際關係能有一貫之理論、其所根據之原則、有如下述、</p>
<p>（一）美國對於武裝衝突、置身事外、</p>
<p>（二）一方面避不與外國訂結同盟、一方面則與一列强及國際聯合會合作、而在美國憲法所許可之限度内、共謀維持和平、</p>
<p>（三）防止美國軍火製造商因戰爭獲取過分之利潤、藉以禁阻美國製造商與外國工業相勾結、</p>
<p>（四）美國遭遇他國攻擊時、務必立於不敗之地、從目前起、卽準備全國人物力力動員計畫、俾美國海軍得建造華盛頓條約所許可之最大艦隊、建設最新式之罕軍、並開鑿尼加拉圭運河、以溝</p>
<p>通大西洋太平洋而與巴拿馬運河相辅而行、</p>
<p>羅斯福總統就職以還、卽宣佈不干涉拉丁美洲各國内政、而與拉丁美洲各國敦睦善鄰、並恢復美俄國交、均已大獲成功、美國與日本現在倫敦談話中、雖有海軍問題之爭執、然兩國關係仍屬圓滿、因此對於戰債問題、羅斯福總統雖始終維持美國應有之權利、但仍竭力避免加重糾</p>
<p>紛、至此次羅斯福宣佈之新外交理論、與曩昔美國各項主要外交原則、如汎美主義·門羅主義·中國門户開放原則等均可兼收併蓄、並不背道而馳、不寗唯是、美國政府與人民最近益復堅信英美諒解爲世界和平之主要條件、今若將海上自由原則加以修改、改則必使英美諒解愈益密切、此外國務院向總統提出修改中立原則之計畫、規定准許大總統下令禁止運輸軍火出口、禁止貸欵於各交戰國、並禁止運輸貨物及軍火於交戰國之各項船隻、停泊美國口岸云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　查爾斯（名）華倫（姓）·曾於一</p>
<p>九一四年至一九一七年在故總統威爾遜政府、擔任司法部長、頃在外交雜誌、對於國務院所考慮之中立新原則一問題、發表文字、并提出一種原則、謂在未來戰爭中、尤其是在英日等海軍國戰事中、美國若欲維持海上自由原則、必致牽入　渦、爰乃主張凡關於中立國一切權利、漩美國總統有權予以放棄、或予以維持、至此項中立權利是否受侵犯以及侵犯情形、是否可作爲宣戰理由、而提交國會審議、亦當由總統加以酌奪、迨至戰事發生後、亦惟總統可享有下開各項權利、</p>
<p>（一）監察全國無線電台、禁止外國外交人員、拍發密碼電訊、（二）禁止以軍器售予交戰國、（三）交戰國船舶載有軍器或裝置砲位者、禁其進口、（四）交戰國所有船舶、得令其離開美國、（五）禁止美國船舶接濟交戰國船舶、（六）禁止美國人民、認購交戰國公債、（七）禁止外國代表在美國境内募集各該國僑民、組織志願隊、</p>
<p>美國海軍首席代表諾曼台維斯之顧問杜里斯、對於上項主張、表示贊同、謂美國政策務求勇敢、卽有相當柔性、俾成爲一種眞正力量、足以維持和平、而在戰端未啟之前、卽可發生效力云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄法否認軍事締盟</h3>
<p>兩國僅外交獲諒解</p>
<p>英報所載完全子虚</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦晚刊星報揭載法俄軍事恊定及商約内容後、駐英法大使署卽聲明此説毫無根據、星報所載、無一字可信此間蘇俄大使署亦稱此説完全子虚、巴黎負責方面亦宣布此説之無據、據巴黎路透電訊、法國當遭聲稱、法俄兩國間除作外交上之諒解、對所議之東洛迦諾公約相互合作、及在東洛迦諾公約談判進行之際、不與第三國締結雙方恊定外、並無其他動作、不知星報何所據而揭載此項消息云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此間報載對於英國星報所載之法俄秘密軍事同盟消息、均不相信、據天主敎之德意志報載稱、此種傳説應愼重視之、柏林日報則謂法俄秘密軍事同盟之消息、所傳已十餘次、每次均告不確、各報對法外長賴伐爾近項在國會中之親善演説、則大載特載、而於法外長所稱邀請德國加入東羅迦諾公約一語、特别指出云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>共黨利用女色敗壤美國軍紀</h3>
<p>美海陸軍情報處之警告</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　海軍情報處處長季爾克曼今日向衆院國家社會主義運動調查委員會陳述時宣稱、水兵之傳統弱點在於好色、共產黨卽利用婦女敗壤軍紀、並煽動叛亂、彼未聞國家社會黨採取類似方法引起海軍之不穏、但共產黨之有此種活動、已獲證據甚多、文學及美貌女子爲共產黨用以麻醉海軍官兵之主要利器、但至今效力甚微云、陸軍情報處處長史密斯亦向委員會稱、共產黨積極進行破壤海陸軍人之紀律、其目的在二次大戰之際引起内戰、史氏復稱、一九三二年情報處在某軍戍地、發覺共產黨總部、其宣傳組織甚爲嚴密、在陸軍及警備軍中引起不穏狀態云、查委員會調查迄今、已搜集共產黨在美國宣傳及採取直接行動之證據甚多、惟國家社會黨之活動、則至今限於大西洋海岸各大都市、此次調查至少尚需二星期始能結束、届時委員會將公佈詳細之調查報告、並草擬議案、以求遏制外人在美國密謀此類之活動云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國預算虧短</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　本年度預算虧絀、日益加重、截至目下爲止、支出經費較之原定額、計已超出三·○四三·四七一鎊之多、同時期内則僅超出九六·七二五·三八二鎊、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>法德民族親善</h3>
<p>歐洲和平有力人障</p>
<p>賴伐爾陳述最近外交</p>
<p>勸德參加東歐互助約</p>
<p>法衆院通過特别軍費八萬萬佛郎</p>
<p>本日參議院討論外交預算案時、外長賴伐爾發表重要宣言、首先謂薩爾問題及南匈兩國糾紛經國聯會解决、關係至爲重大、南匈兩國各能平心靜氣、而其他各國亦自動幹旋、以求息事寗人、兩者皆可欽佩、述及法意關係、謂兩國正在進行談判、除與兩國特别有關係之間題以外、並欲就一般政策、方求兩國意見之恊和、賴氏稱贊意相墨索里尼之調和精神、謂法意兩國所擬成立之妥恊、絶不致妨害小恊商各國利益、外長嗣言及東歐互助公約之談判、謂法國係與蘇俄完全同意之後、始有此項提議、「法俄兩國之携手、係公開行之、其目的乃在爲大衆謀利益」、賴氏言及德國、謂法國絶不作何行動、使德人疑法國實行何種政策、致德匣陷於孤立、「法國不久戕從新與德國談判、敦勸德國與法國及他國進行談判、其條件與地位一律相同、並勸其參加東歐互助公約、凡該約許予其他簽字國之保障、德國亦能享有之」、賴氏結論、謂「法德兩國在國際範圍内之接近、實爲和平之有效保障」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>賴氏並披露促進東歐羅迦諾條約之法俄草約全文、賴氏發言之前、海軍部長庇特利曾在參院聲稱、海軍建造必須加速進行、並堅持一九三五年之海軍建造費、必須有十二萬萬法郎、而一九三四年爲九萬萬法郎、庇氏並謂、法國向視華盛頓軍縮條約爲「暫時的必須品」故法國拒絶與日本共同廢約、以免拂英國之意、而使歐洲失和也云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　衆院今日以四六零對一三零票通過追加豫算八萬萬佛郎、以充革新法國戰品經費議案、社會黨曾提出修正文、主張軍火由國家製造、並自明年一月一日起、軍火貿易由國家統制、總理佛蘭亭以此修正文爲信任問題、衆院卒以三八八對一九九票打銷社會黨之修正文、急進社會黨請於明年一月間辯論該問題、卽經政府接受、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　按陸軍部預算案所列國防特别費八萬萬法郎、其分配如下、（一）大砲及其他軍器六一五·五○○·○○○法郎、（二）工程隊四八·○○○·○○○法郎、（三）軍需三五·○○○·○○○法郎、（四）衛生事務一五·○○○·○○○法郎、（五）火藥八○·○○○·○○○法郎、（六）鐵道六·五○○·○○○·法郎、</p>
<p>該案今晨由衆院討論時佛蘭亭總理迭次發言、説明國防上之需要、結果此案卒以四六○對一三○票通過、内除正統派社會黨依照慣例投票反對而外、其位於極左派之共產黨竟願投票贊成、此在世界議會史上、實開一空前局面、至堪注意午前討論之際、前航空部長谷脱要求軍備製造業收歸國營、謂吾人誠願效疆塲、但有一條件、卽當使吾人　知戰事非少數人致富之源是也、（意謂軍火商人在戰事中坐獲巨利）」佛蘭亭總理答稱、渠甚願軍備製造收歸國營、但法國在歐戰中獲得經騐、足以證明歐戰期内法國若僅賴本國兵工廠接濟、則早已缺乏防禦軍器、而被敵人聲潰矣、法國要求由愛護和平之國家、對於軍火販賣訂立國際公約、加以監督、「至於法國、則業已努力縮减軍備至於最低限度假若仍不獲已、而當從新努力籌劃國防、則其咎固不在法國也、現有大國焉、增加軍器製造廠之數額、每月製造費用在三萬五千萬至六萬萬法郎之間、此豈吾人所能爲力者乎、總之爲法國安全着想、吾人不得不先求諸已而後求人、」迨午後繼續討論時、新任社會黨議員貝蘭發表意見、對於德國重整軍備之危險、予以承認、謂新社會黨將投票贊成國防特别經費案、並將以此案爲理由、反對增加軍役期限、（係指軍役期限由十八個月加至二年而言）、陸軍部長摩冷將軍起立致辭、要求衆院秉犠牲精神、通過特别經費案、謂法國軍事設備已趨陳舊、當予更新、又謂「法國邊防工事、不能如中國之長城數千里連互不斷、自必有不設防衛之處、勢當加以堵塞、摩冷將軍又允諾創辦技師隊、從事邊防技術上之工作（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英航空部整理航空組織</h3>
<p>用與軍用分立</p>
<p>（　　　）　航空部頃將民用航空組織整理就緒、其要點有二、（一）民用航空與軍用航空完全分立（二）關於民用航空各問題、不再提交航空高級委員會審核、按航空部所設民用航空監察委員會、前於七月間發表報告書、主張關於民用航空之一切機關、對於政府所直轄之各空軍機關、應較現在更爲獨立、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>軍縮會議入於睡眠狀態</h3>
<p>委員會工作仍進行</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　軍縮會議自十一月二十日主席團開會一次以後、旋卽入於睡眠狀態、但其所屬各機關仍在繼續工作、此由該會之國防經費委員會可以證之、該委員會現已將關於國防經費之公約起草完竣、並造具報告書、主張（一）簽約國對於有關國防之一切經費、須負相互通知之義務、（二）規定國防預算之公開及監察辦法、公開及監察之時間有三、（甲）預算案通過時、（乙）如有追加或减少經費之情形時、則於事後九個月或十五個月行之、（丙）經國内高級機關審核之後（按此指支付命令及决算案經審計機關審核而言、）各專家以爲此種國防經費之公約如能實行、則軍事經費旣能公開、而軍額及軍器卽亦隨之公開、兩者之間將發生密切聯帶關係矣、此項報告書、擬於明年一月以内提交軍縮會議云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>又有人恫嚇羅斯福</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　衆議員福克斯今日聲稱、渠接到來函四通、内稱、如再擁護行政元首、則將遭遇意外事件云、聞羅總統亦接有威嚇函件、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>調解大厦谷爭端</h3>
<p>國聯又遭失敗</p>
<p>巴拉圭接受建議</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯解决玻璃維亞與巴拉圭兩國間大厦谷爭端之最近努务、已遭失敗、玻璃維亞雖於十二月十日致文國聯、無條件接受建議、但巴拉圭今日通告國聯、謂此項建議、碍難實施、故特提出新建議、謂可爲繼續談判之基礎云、國聯將於日内考慮之、按國聯所提之建議爲兩交戰國應在阿眞廷京城召集休戰會議、由阿眞廷巴西智利秘魯美國五國爲會議中之仲裁人、如在兩個月内不能宣布休戰、則應訴諸海牙永久法庭、如果停止戰爭、則應由美國與南美各國之代表組織軍事委員團、恊同勘劃廣一百公里之不設軍備區城、（十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>巴拉圭軍八萬大舉進攻玻軍</h3>
<p>砲聲晝夜不息</p>
<p>拉巴斯　巴拉圭軍今日以八萬之衆大舉進攻玻璃維亞防綫、擬佔領大厦谷煤油區之門户維拉蒙脱、巴軍並不希望唾手而得、因此將使二年餘來大厦谷戰爭揭開最猛烈之一幕、目下重砲之聲晝夜不息、數十里外隠約可聞、玻政府亦曾發表公報、稱巴軍已在維拉蒙脱大道向玻軍陣綫舉行總攻、最猛烈之戰爭係以道别尼要塞爲中心、玻國公報謂玻軍已集中全力於最險要之地點、萬難搖動、如巴軍佔領維拉蒙脱、則可長驅直入、攻及玻國本部矣、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國對付太平洋風雲的態度</h3>
<p>實行兩大洋間艦隊移動</p>
<p>倫敦海縮預備會、若斷若續、英國一再提出試案、都爲與事實不符、英·美·日·三國主張各異、因而擱淺了、美國近來忙於改選、忙於「新政策」、忙於救濟失業等國内問題、對太平洋海上風潮丨丨將來的海軍競爭丨丨好像並不十分積極、且也没有具體的主張、可是他知道、日本廢除海軍條約是會實現的、口頭的調和恐怕不會發生效力、所以他也從事於軍事的實際工作、想以他的實際力量來支持他的主張、</p>
<p>實力所包含的有他天然的各種礦藏、有現在的各產業部門的生產能力、有他一切的交通工具、有海·陸·空軍隊、一一加以檢討、是很不容易的、從根本上講、美國的力量、當然是現世界各國中、最有實力的國家、但自一九二九年以來、受經濟恐慌的襲擊、永久繁榮的招牌、就不可靠了、現在也許可以説他的實力、略有虧耗、遠大的企圖、恐一時難以實現、先要緊解决國内的問題、然而我們知道美國、已充分發逹成近代的產業國家、卽其農業、也都進到機械經營、所以單靠國内市塲、是不能維持現狀的、並且維持現狀、也不是根本辦法、那末他必須要像英國那樣努务開拓海外市塲、從國外去找經濟的出路、歐戰而後、美國本已成爲巨大的金融資本國家、對海外是以金融投痪爲重、而貨品消塲爲輕、可是最近（自德國一九三一年停付賠欵起）、歐洲諸國、相繼賴債、南美也如此、今年底到期債務、英國也許會不付、則對外投資就不很可靠了、於是他理不能不設法使消售市塲、重新穩定、以促進產業界的生機、</p>
<p>太平洋沿岸各國都是優美的消塲、無論棉花·鋼鐵·機械·等等、將來都是有希望的、不過在那邊關係、相當複雜、競爭也很激烈、而且美國在遠東、没有商業上的特殊勢力範圍、現時國家統制經濟發展的時代、競爭是不大便利的、軍事上縱有一個菲利濱和關島、但是地方隔得太遠十年後菲島又要獨立、關島彈丸之地、那有支持的能力、因此美國就必需重依海軍、使他有充分保障海上航行的能力、美國的海軍、的確是次於英國、而巡洋艦和潛水艇亦不及日本、祇有主力艦能勉强應付、而又分隔於美洲、介在兩大洋之間、一朝事變發生、要集中兵力、是很費事的啊、</p>
<p>所幸巴拿馬運河已經開通了、兩大洋之間的啣接、可以不費大事、今年春天太平洋艦隊東渡運河、費了四十八點鐘、這次一百三十餘艘戰艦、十萬將兵西來、却祇用了四十一點又四十分鐘渡河、其迅速敏捷、眞是越見進步了、從此以後、大西洋艦隊和太平洋艦隊更容易揉成一個集體、不再受地理上的制限東來西去、十分自如、今後他要將大西洋與太平洋艦隊合住在一起、今年在這邊、明年在那邊、不斷的移動、以訓練他自己的軍兵、同時也稍微挹注附近居民、艦隊的給養採辦和將士家族的費用、也是一筆很大的消耗、</p>
<p>美政府何以竟不惜多耗費軍艦的移動費、令兩洋艦隊、每年都要遠航一次、這就是美國海軍近來的應付方策、因爲他的補助各艦、還有曾造好、把兩個艦隊、分開來駐、萬一有事變時、將難於處斷、如落於被動地位、就很吃虧了、所以他必須打破這一類天然的限制、充分善用其兵力、使他的假想敵人、有所顧忌、同時也照應着遠東的菲利濱及其以外的市塲、要他的海上航路、有充分保障、並暗示其實力的雄厚、至於借此補助駐兵地帶的經濟週轉、那是一件比較的小事、（十一月二十五日於華盛頓）</p>
<h3>日鮮浪人奉令退出戰區</h3>
<p>浪人以賣毒設睹爲業</p>
<p>經我方要求日始取締</p>
<p>北平通信、「戰區」内日鮮浪人、平時專以賣毒設賭爲業、經我方迭向日方要求取締、頃日方已令該浪人等、限期退出、據唐山來人談、該市日鮮浪人、於十四日奉到日憲兵部命令時、卽召開全體大會、討論辦法、决定遵令退出、故近三數日來、日鮮人均準備一切、並拍賣傢俱、充作川資、以便離去、明年元旦日起、唐山街上日鮮僑民數目當可减少、另據遵化縣政府今（十八）晨向此間關係方面報稱、該縣日鮮浪人之非法商店、亦由日本憲兵於日昨分别傳知、限卽歇業、整裝返日、逾期不遵、卽予强迫驅逐、該縣日鮮浪人、業亦作離去該地之準備等語、記者頃特向關係方面探詢眞相、據稱、「戰區」内日鮮浪人之滋事、中日雙方、均認爲有取締必要、疊經商榷、日方允分别處理、最近唐山·遵化等地日鮮浪人奉令退出、卽係實施取締之開端、戰區内各縣日鮮浪人、如逐步取締不輟、則「戰區」内治安、可望漸臻鞏固、而於中日兩國國民盛情、裨益亦非淺鮮云云、（十八日）</p>

<h3>從排華的見解想到他們的友敵（續）　周啟剛</h3>
<p>海氏之言論、當然是抑華丨丨最低限度亦是不滿於華僑之一</p>
<p>種代表聲調，這種不滿於華僑的聲調或排華的言論，却是由於忽略與娛解而引起的。説到亭裏，我們記憶到一句話「英國與中國合作，是一條牛路···」後一句話，我們不必寫下，但從這樣來想像，又可引述中國兩句成語··「國以民爲本，民以食爲天」來表解。原來有了領土，尙不能成事，總要有人，而這種有用的人又須得食，這個道理，實在是人類演進生存的要素，無論在政府亦好，經濟亦好，確不能離此要素的，大家都知到「英國國旗無日落」，是形容英國領土的廣闊，「海波到處有華僑」是表現中國僑民發佈之深遠，海氏如不否認上面的事實，就可以公广討論，假如英屬不要華僑而代以英人來經營呢？抑以日本人來代呢？或完全交回土人（馬來人）自作呢？我恐海君祇有本着「要則招之使來，棄則揮之使去」的危險方針以外，不易找出答案吧！但我們以客觀條件去研究一下、在要則招之。棄則揮之的方法，我們的僑胞或許在某一時期，尙可忍受，若是别一國的僑民呢，其手段的高妙，恐怕比華人聰明得多，這有是我們的客氣，亦不是我們的挑撥，老實的説句，華僑如果退出來，馬來亞恐非英國所屬有；英人不願與華人爲友、當然是一問題，但是華僑不帮助英屬，是否又成問題呢？祇有讓大家去研究，因爲我們華僑所作的事業，自有歷史上的事業可以證明，如果徒自邀功誇耀，倒反减低他的價値，不過我們敢確定，英屬的敵人，决不是華僑，如果英屬確有敵人，恐怕另外一個，所以我們對於排華抑華這種言論，總願以友誼的態度帮助他們對華僑得到正確的認識。</p>
<p>從上面的分析，可知排華之發生，不外是一種客觀的環境及主觀的誤解所形成的。</p>
<p>就客觀環境説，則是因爲現今世界經濟恐慌，無也不入，所以开成各國一種「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」的張皇失措樣子。甚至不惜「飮酖止渴」以圖一時興奮的滿足。正如現在列强在世界的勾鬥縱横椑闔，你來我應，什麽增加關税，限制入口貨，大家都忽略了世界經濟之共通性統一性及向上性的，而走向了這種自埋自掘的途程。甚到得魚忘筌，把當地繁榮根源的華僑，也加以抑壓和排斥，結果，環境愈閙愈糟。</p>
<p>主觀的誤解，也是排華發生的一大原因。不從縱的方面，認識華僑在當地所貢獻的功績，以理解華僑在當地之經濟的發展；或横的方面，分析華僑經濟與當地繁榮之關係，以明瞭華僑對於土人及當地政府的帮助，都是會走向於抑華排華的迷途。</p>
<p>如果根據事實的分析，可知華僑在當地經濟上的活動，還有幾個大的特色··（一）有堅忍耐勞的特性而且生活程度的又非常之低微，（二）有一種博愛和平的天然美德，謹守賓主之份以服從當地之秩序及法律，（三）華僑本已所不欲勿施於人之敎，愛居留地有如愛母國一樣，只知繼續發展地方財富以增進繁榮，（四）華僑在體力上，智力上，事實上，不特不是歐人統治者的代替人（Ｓｕｐｐｌｃｎｔ）倒反來是他們的補助者（Ｓｕｐｐｌａｎｔｅｍｔｎｅ）丨丨這是歐洲人自己説過的話，就是借作本文的殿軍。　　　　　（完）</p>

<p>洋拆高漲年關常態</p>
<p>華東社云、日來本市謠傳政府將實行通貨膨張説、致交易市塲、變動極烈、茲經孔財長於前晚向華東社記者、鄭重聲明不確後、昨日、各交易已漸趨平定、茲經記者探得昨日各情如次、</p>
<h3>平復經過</h3>
<p>連日因謠言突起後、各種交易變動劇烈、人心大起恐慌、尤以標金公債等變動爲烈、茲經華東社記者向孔財長探悉不確後、昨日、標金證券等已漸趨平定、昨日中央掛牌、上涨標金標準爲一○○五·八○、金業市塲最高價格不出一○○○元、最低祇九九三·七元、相差祇五元三、市面交易、利於少數小户多頭、空頭較少、公債市塲亦尙穏定、相差不滿一元額、紗布麵粉等、亦已漸入正軌、花相差二三角、紗布僅七八角、下午雖略有變動、亦極少數而已、</p>
<h3>謠言起因</h3>
<p>據華東社記者連日向市塲·銀行界·實業界·及半官方面、探得此次謠言起因、乃係投機者故意散佈流言所致、謂五中全會時、某中委提議、實行通貧膨脹、幸因時機未熟、未經提出、造謠者卽見機造利於多方或空方之謠言、致市塲人心大亂、市面時陷風雨飄搖之局、據金融界各鉅頭聲稱、美國係世界黄金之國、尙且實行通貨膨脹、無多大成效、我國在此時期、絶有可能、政府决不實行、市塲上正不必庸人自擾、而貽外人以操縱之機也云、</p>
<h3>洋拆復漲</h3>
<p>昨日上下午洋拆爲三角五分、較前日復高五分、劃頭亦高、爲三角八分、表面上似乎又已漸趨緊漲、但實際上在年關節近之十餘日中、此種情形、係極变通之現象、據錢業界中人向華東社記者稱、今年銀根雖較去年爲稍緊、但並不能謂爲奇緊、在民國十三年齊魯之戰、及民國十六年國府奠都南京時之二個年節、曾一度逹七角限價之最高峯云云、</p>

<p>未敢駛往石浦　該輪嗣復經水警隊、會同船上獲航警、在各艙向旅客及行李等件、嚴密搜檢、始於是是下午五時、由水警隊派警隨輪護送、照常啟駛海門·黄岩等碼頭、惟於石浦碼頭、因上次新海門輪失事、海盜即在該處登輪、咸有戒心、故未駛往、接卸旅客、至搭載赴石浦旅客及貨物、均換搭新海門輪送卸、因新海門是日適</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任敎平視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>若是我説的辦法，你們覺得是不能稱心，那麽，他依然姓他的朱，我依然姓我的賈，還有什麽話可談？月英聽到這裏，才知道讓人家看了這樣久，還摸了手，人家還不一定的要，窮人家姑娘，竟是這樣的没有身分，心裏一疫，兩行眼淚，就差不多要搶着流出來。胡嫂子倒没有什麽感觸，覺得若是照生意買賣來説，這是應該的。便問道··若是照賈老爺的説法，應當怎樣的辦呢？賈多才搖撼着身體，正想把那話説了出來，却聽到門外邊有人呌了一聲賈兄在爱嗎？賈多才聽得出那聲音來，正是李士廉，於是答道，在家在家，口裏説着，人已是搶出了門去，這就攔着李士廉，低聲笑道··那個小傢伙，在我屋裏。李士廉眯了眼笑道··你眞了不得，居然把他先就弄到手了。賈多才笑道··不要瞎説，屋子裏還有個小脚女人在那裏陪着呢，我們還是剛剛的磋商條件。李士廉昂了頭躇躊着，沉吟着道··這事就太不凑巧了。賈多才笑道··什麽？你説的是昨天那個女人嗎？謹受敎，謹受敎。李士廉正色道··是正經的事，不是玩笑的事。這小西天裏，不是新到有兩個德國人嗎？那是和我同車來的。賈多才道··提到外國人作什麽？李士廉道··他手下有個中國帮手趙國富，對我説··那兩個德國人想同你談談。賈多才道··是麽？他想和我談什麽呢？李士廉道··這個我可不曉得，旣是他特意託我來和你通知，想必總有什麽事情要商量，你何妨就和他談談呢？不過你屋子裏正有女客，這時候似乎不便要他來。（九四）</p>
<h3>大霧中</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>雖然日子已是在望前的二日了，但是霧瀰漫着整個的海面。莫説月光是給霧完全阻隔了，就是强烈的探海燈光，也射不到一丈以外。大海輪上的回聲，雖是不住地拉着，可是在重霧中聽着，倒像小孩子在吹着玩具喇叭。</p>
<p>徐長興的大沙船，滿載着貨品，從天津開向上海。雖然那一晚是已到逹了離淞口只有二十海里，整備着辛苦一夜，便可趕着早潮進口了，但大霧是阻住了去路。</p>
<p>海，是白茫茫的，已失了靜穆的精神，雄偉的姿態，雖然水依然是那麽的激盪着船底。全船上的三十餘人，都全神灌注的防備着不測事件的發生，因爲據老於航海者的經騐，在這種重霧的籠罩之下，不幸的降臨，是很容易的。</p>
<p>果然，在半個太陽才爬出水面的一刹那中，一條大海輪上的探照燈，突然的衝破了一丈多些厚的霧壁，直射上徐長與的船上來，雖然那海輪是速率很低，但是不到十秒鐘，𥒐的一聲響，和着一片哭喊聲，呼救聲，在大海裏航行了十餘年的徐長興的大沙船，是給海輪撞成了二截，而在半分鐘之間，完全沉下了海底。漂浮在水面上的，只是些船板，雜物，以及幾個瞧不清面目的船伙而已。</p>
<p>到了下一天的午後。除了十幾個船伙兒，被海輪拯救而帶着進口之外，其餘的，都給海神吞噬了，雖然他們的妻子，還是候在海岸上，希望着被别條船救回來。</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （金泱）</p>
<p>一個人不承認自己的錯，就是無改過的决心。</p>
<p>在你未跳躍的一刹那前，先向上下四週環顧一下。</p>
<p>投稿的人不見稿子登出來，與編輯先生收不到好稿子，同樣的痛苦。</p>
<h3>掃葉人的微笑</h3>
<p>— 心仁</p>
<p>春花秋月的良辰美景中，從没有瞧見這林蔭路上有這樣一個老態龍鍾的掃葉人。直到了十月裏的下半個月。窓前的絲蘿變成了龍蛇似的枯骨，從我的住房裏可以直視對面園子外邊的建築，我才從冬天的季候風上得到年歲已經遲暮了的感覺，似乎是依戀那枝頭上僅存的幾片綠葉，我披衣走到鄰屋的空地上，正在對着天空的碧色凝視，我便聽得從林裏響着遲重的步履聲，隨着我便看見那掃葉的老人，他的手裏握着一把很大的竹帚，竪立起來幾乎比他那彎曲的身子還要長，在他那掛到胸口的銀灰色長鬚上，我可以看見他的年紀已經很老，他戴着一頂别人遺棄了的法蘭西絨帽，一件脱了扣子的毛綫衣包住了裏邊的棉襖，脚上已經穿着棉鞋了，老年人是比年輕的容易感冷些，但是他的手指還在戰顫着，好像身上的衣服還不够禦寒似的。我和他立在一起不多久便説起話來了。</p>
<p>「老老頭，你什麽時候才做著這個職業？」我問着，他並没有回答，祇向我微笑着，好像他的知道我在問話是用眼睛而非是耳朶聽見的，我接着又問丨</p>
<p>「你呌什麽名字哪？」</p>
<p>「你的家呢？」他全衹報以一笑，我接着再問他的家裏有什麽人？他却搖着頭，表示着没有。</p>
<p>「那麽你每天可以掃多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>他聽得這句問話却似乎興奮了一點，銀灰色的鬍子動了動，做出要説話的樣子，但終於没有説出一個字來。我心裏不覺感到一陣子同情，説··</p>
<p>「你來，到我那裏息一息不是好嗎？」</p>
<p>於是這話聲又激起他一陣微笑，慘淡的一陣微笑，他俯下頭去，移動遲重的脚步，把竹帚揮動地上的黄葉兒，彎曲的身子被太陽照下一個彎曲的身影，落在黄葉上。···他終於没有應承我的邀請。</p>
<p>年歲的確遲暮了，我微微地發了一聲嘆息。</p>
<p>走回了家，天黑了，我黑暗裏還看見掃葉人的笑痕。</p>
<h3>不同的世界</h3>

<p>沿着電車站等處，亦必有烟紙店。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>當它最初投生爲一頭狐狸的時候，它一起有九條尾巴，都是很豐潤美麗的··此外它還會使一種隠身的法術。待到末了，伊竟喪失了八條尾巴，幸而它的寳貴的隠身術還依舊保留着，使它不致一無所長。原來它那九條尾巴實在是九種惡習慣，他因爲有了這九種惡習慣，便日漸陷溺，一天一天的墮落下來，成爲天地間的一個不良份子。</p>
<p>那九種惡習慣是什麽呢？第一種是歡喜喝酒，常常喝醉；第二種是鹵莽疏忽；第三種是没有誠意，動不動就要説謊作假；第四種是貪財，見了寳貴的東西便眼紅；第五種是性格暴躁；第六種是貪吃，時常要偷食人家的食物；第七種是貪得無饜，有了一，還想兩；第八種是貪色，見了美麗的女人總難免顚倒起來；第九種是貪淫，往往縱慾無度。這九種惡習慣竟把它整個的心靈矇蔽住了，它差不多是天天在作惡；後來終於給玉帝知道了，大怒之下，便立卽把它提去，很嚴厲地申斥了一番。最後就説：「從今以後，你必須改過自新，做一頭善良的狐狸丨現在唯一辦法，就是把你的尾巴割下一條？」它聽了非常的焦急，因爲它對於自己的九條尾巴可説是没有不愛的，他不知道在這九條尾巴之中，去掉了那一條可以使它感受到最低限度的痛苦。然而玉帝却不許他有選擇的機會，便立卽發下令來，斬掉了那使它歡喜喝酒的尾巴。又再三誥誡道：「現在我再給你一千年的工夫，讓你自己去好好地修養，務必把你的行爲改變過來。（二○四）</p>
<p>游踪所至</p>
<h3>錫宜道中</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>凄微秋雨，蔭濕了暗淡的晨街。從第二旅社輕手輕脚地溜出來，似乎不怕風雨的車夫，全蜂擁過來，在呌：「先生，竈頭渚？哦，小箕山？…梅園？」那聲音有一點抖，也有一點輕薄。</p>
<p>照例搖了搖頭，拉起自己的衣領，向這無限恬靜凉爽的石馬路上走。雖然心裏憧憬着宜興的雙洞，因而叱起了堅强的勇氣。但萬一雨越下越猛，倒底不是旅行家的幸福。</p>
<p>「可是，停留在無錫城裏，看雨，有什麽意思呢？雨再大一點，也得上宜興去呢。」最後，這樣堅定了徬徨的意志。</p>
<p>就在通運橋下江南汽車公司對面的一家茶舖子裏吃了一碗湯麵，向站上買得了一元一角的來回票，坐上第四次車，在正七點鐘離開了這城市。當經過西北部的黄埠墩，那樣嫵媚地鎭坐在運河的中流，垂楊隙處，漏出紅牆，兼有漁帆在水風裏飛駛，倒本能地想起了南湖烟雨樓的丯姿。現在不正漫天揚着散絲？</p>
<p>我們底汽車竄進了榮巷，喇叭不斷地吼着。車頂幾乎齊了兩遊的屋檐，車身也正適可地掠過兩邊的階沿；如果轉彎時太快，或者對面的行人退讓得較慢一點的話，我想這裏非常容易發生輾斃的危險。根本在小市集上不適宜有交通車的來往，而這市集的街道又是那樣狹；我眞想不出榮巷地方的人士，爲什麽不替自己的生命珍惜而加以反對！</p>
<p>三十分鐘到梅園，停了一刻。那再待百多天將以香雪海著名的園林，此刻還招不到雅人來踏雪尋詩，而且蓊鬱的木葉叢中，一聲山鳥都聽不着。再從楊灣到雪堰橋，車子靠着右面的山巒，蜿蜒西行；左面那個太湖的銀波光影，便像流汞似的閃亭幽鬱的病眼亮　水掛在天邊，天銜在水上，一片蒼茫，連一絲淺藍的界痕都辨不出來。湖中的山，眠在白緞子上，擁了幾個媚人的螺　，那些游艇和烏篷船，只蒼蠅那麽一點黑，遲綏地爬着。</p>
<p>這車不僅是左湖右山，而且轉曲高下得厲害，往往車子靠近湖邊，前面好像無路可走了，但峯回徑轉，馬上駛進山腹去，湖面就遠了小了；不上幾時、山徑又向外展開，仍把湖波送還來。正像一條蜷曲的長龍，伸展着肢體，盤盤囷囷地從山頂掛下來，又從湖面飛上去。如果你乘過富杭路車，從梵村到六和塔一段；你一辷會説和這兒的風景絶相類似。但我以爲二龍頭的山色湖光，因了之江不及太湖，偉大還是屬於這兒的。</p>
<p>潘家橋以西，太湖離開了我們，不復可見。</p>
<p>山色也缺少了掩映，不像先前的靈秀飛動了。倒是天雨已止，睛雲放碧，太陽也慢慢地開朗，照得密綴着珍珠的松林岩石，特别鮮麗遠峯近峯，依次從銀灰的烟霧裏探出頭來。在和橋站邊，瀕河有漁人披着棕簑，在晒濕網，有的搦着釣竿，凝眸在窺探我們的車子飛過，眞是一首曼妙的詩篇！</p>
<p>同車的鄉人，衣冠非常樸素。他們會客氣地告訴你以獨山的陶器，茗嶺的茶葉那一家的最妈；常州通和橋的交通車，什麽時候可以開駛；然而一問庚桑和善卷，就都瞠目不能置答了。越是近城的人，爲了勞作的累贅，越不曾拜訪他們本地的風光，這或者也由於意趣不同。所以城裏人偏羡山中人的生活，不辭老遠去登峯探洞；而樵夫桑婦，一見了城裏人的羅綾車馬，又是那樣的羡慕着了！</p>
<p>不知不覺，把看山的時間，消費在間談中了。突地車箱裏的乘客起了騷動，都在整理行裝；抬頭一瞧又發現了一片城河，摟抱紅色屋頂的車站，站屋上穎然標明着大字，指示以宜興果然到了！</p>

<h3>美國銀股突然低落</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告昨（十八日）紐約股市參差、其特點爲銀股之低落、查銀股並未有特殊之壓力、其下降全係受紐約蒙脱里及倫敦銀價低落之影響、至銀價之跌、則因傳美國因十機者大量塞出、中止購買之所致、同時謠傳中國或將减低銀元之成色、雖經半官式方面之否認、亦爲促成銀價跌落之原因、而上海與「滿洲國」之通貨咸受其影響焉、又華盛頓來訊、謂財部人員對美國在倫敦中止購銀之報告、不願討論、重申政府購銀活動有保守極端秘密之必要、以免市塲揪起巨大之風浪、據私从估計、美國銀準備離法定額尙缺十萬萬翁斯、倫敦白銀界人士對以上報告、認爲不確、謂彼等知美國在本日購銀云、債市參差互見、全日成交八十二萬股、茲將　瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>美棉近跌遠漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市價漲跌二磅音、十二月期多頭、因交割通知已逹九百包、紛紛了結、然因成交不多、市况較昂、同業略有買進、南方套賣甚鮮、囤棉未見出售、買户恐市價一高、重行出售、仍有戒心、最後本地帮從事補空、各月漲起四至七磅音、獨十二月期二磅音、現棉需要不振、紗布市况靜而堅、利物浦據報有小交易、多方轉賣之額、均爲孟買帮及同業所吸收、計現貨漲五磅音、期貨漲跌二至九磅音、英棉現貨跌三點、期貨跌一二點、印棉因歐洲出口商及投機家賣出而疲、計平果爾跌二角半、奥姆辣跌一羅比、白羅溪跌七角半、原電錄左、（十八日電）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>浮多略吐遠期粉</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈近穏遠疲之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好四分至一角零、坎拿大好一角半不等、當開價時、本月份以客帮微有抽裝現粉去胃、頗形活絡、故市氣見穏、遠期各月份、以大户多頭未動、浮多微有了結、人心曾一度軟弱、較前日收價、回落一二分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因帮抽動、依然站住、遠期則廠抛不繼、致市塲形勢、亦稍稍帶振、較上午回好分外、觀前途市情、如洋麥合劃、當看小勢、否則須擯住也、結果本月份較好半分、一二月份小二厘半、三月份小七厘半、四月份小半分、五月份小二厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥靜中帶疲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致清寂平弱之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好四分至一角零、坎拿大好一角半左右、當開價時、各月份交易、依然清淡、本月份因交割已近、籌碼亦未甚巨、套貨方面、無意收回、故形勢靜中帶疲、遠期以買户甚少、上落無幾、此種情形、實係國曆年關已近、本埠與客户交易抣無形停頓、是以前途殊少大變化也、結果本月份較前日小三分、一月份小一分、二月份好一分、餘無出入、現麥因廠胃不動、擯住不動云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、市塲吸收大量之脱售、設國外需要未有進步、雖有新買進、目下恐不足進價格之高漲耳、</p>

<h3>國貨商標</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨與非國貨，辨别甚難，最足以使人一覽了然者，無過於商標。大凡一種商品，其能取得社會之信任者，固在製造之精良，與售價之低廉，而使人永誌不忘者，厥在所定之商標。商標之要點：（一）在簡單易别，令人一望而知。（二）在通俗明白，務令婦孺皆知。（三）在富有趣味，令人不致忘記。苟能表明出品之優點，與發揚國貨之特長，尤覺富有價値。昔時國貨廠商，爲迎合顧客喜用外貨心理起見，明明爲中國國貨，反多採用外國文字，非但失却國貨之尊嚴，轉使欲用國貨者易於混淆，有莫知適從之弊病。在此國民愛國心理極爲發皇，人人樂用國貨之時代，似有必再用外國文字，以混淆國人之心目，尤應以商品特點，隨時藉商標以公布於社會，使販賣者知所取舍，服用者有所問津。歐美日本各國之工廠，時時賽會，月月陳列，以故國人採用貨品，成竹在胸，無詢問之勞，有指定之便，國貨發逹，有由來也。吾國廠商惑於近利，尤惜小費，於此種商標之宣傳，有屑措意，於商品之陳列，亦不講求，甚至專以副牌次貨，自墮信用。國貨前途，此爲極大暗礁。最近婦女國貨年運動委員會，舉行國貨商標展覽會，集各廠之商標，爲公開之展覽，使喜用某種商品者，益堅其信仰，意義深長，饒有價値。深望各國貨廠商此後更能注意於商標之運用，以保持其商品之尊嚴，益事改進出品，减低成本，爲社會所歡迎，此則記者所切望者也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>希望於學生國貨年者</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今年的婦女國貨年，轉瞬之間，要</p>
<p>和我們分别了！明年將定爲「學生國貨年，」好一個「學生國貨年，」記者雖已脱離學生生活已久，但也絶對的贊同，我想：各位正在求學的靑年同胞，聽到了這個消息，一定也是非常喜悦，表示十二萬分的同意的。</p>
<p>在學生國貨年將來未來的時候，記者敢以靑年的地位，對一般可敬可愛的學生同志們，作一個懇切的懇求，懇求些什麽？請聽我道來：</p>
<p>（一）希望學生們卽日起立下一個服用國貨的决心：學生是國家的棟樑，社會的中心，民族的救星，救國，救民族，固然希望學生們負其責任，就是提倡國貨，也是希望學生們努力宣傳的，假如全國的學生們，能有十分之八，能忠心的服用國貨，宣傳國貨，同時，更認服用外貨，爲人生莫大的恥辱，那末，中國的國貨運動，一定能得到不少的帮助，無限量的推進，以及偉大的成績的。所以，我很希望全中國的靑年學生們，從卽日起，卽宣誓服用國貨，宣傳國貨，使國貨運動在學生們努力之下，能有超人的成績，表示出來，一方面使社會人士，認識學生們的精神，是了不得的，同時也可以糾正一般人認學生是外貨推銷員的觀念。</p>
<p>（二）希望學生們能組織服用國貨的小團體，以收互相監督之效：我很希望在學生國貨年開始的時候，各校學生，都開始成立服用國貨的小團體，五個人一組也好，十個人一組也好，請敎師做指導員，團體中應訂定服用國貨的辦法，宣傳國貨的方針，互相監督，互相勉勵努力，在現在，大可以馬上籌備起來，到元旦日開始成立，我想：這也是一件很有意義的工作。</p>
<p>（三）希望敎師們，時常鼓勵學生：學生一切成績的好壤，做敎師的人，實在有密切的關係，同樣，要希望學生國貨年有效果，做敎師的人，也要負起鼓勵的責任來，我雖不研究敎育，但很知道學生們是最喜歡受先生的獎勵的，敎師們應該利用此種心理，來鼓勵學生服用國貨，校中也不妨組織一個「奬勵學生服用國貨委員會」，來主持這項工作，這倒是一件很有價値，很有意義的工作，全國各學校，大可以試騐一下，與國家民族，實有很大的密切的關係。</p>
<p>上述三者，是我所希望於卽將到來的學生國貨年者，未識能引起諸位靑年學生同志以及敎師們的同情否？</p>
<h3>談談商業竸爭</h3>
<p>— 楊崇臯</p>
<p>外貨的急湧輸入，外商的日見增多</p>
<p>，中國的商人們應當猛然的省悟了。在這「競爭爲商業之生命」的現時代，那麽狀况下的商界，是必須有競爭的智能，諳競爭的心理，和會使競爭的手腕。纔能使業務蒸蒸日上，不致遭受衰落和淘汰。</p>
<p>我們要爲競爭下一個公式是不可能的，我們要藉「競爭爲商業之生命」來解决商業上的一切問題是更不可能的。我們必須明瞭競爭能使商業的生命滋長，也能使商業的生命死亡。這完全要看競爭的施用在商業發展的正當與否而定的。</p>
<p>近年來，社會經濟的恐慌，凡有事業的不景氣，我國商界所走的路是更往下落了，簡直可以説完全走上了岐途，大家不把正當的方法去謀救濟，以解目前的危機。竟都在苟安一時玩弄着欺騙的手段，但西洋鏡總是容易拆穿的，到了那時是山窮水盡了。</p>
<p>商界須知道競爭者在制度的原則下，要就能力範圍内互相競爭才是合理的，能求優勝的。更須具有誠實的精神丨丨「劃定價格」「貨眞價値」丨丨科學的頭腦和藝術的選擇是也决不能少的。</p>
<p>如果想憑了滑頭的「大賤賣」，「足尺加三」「甘虧血本大拍賣」···的使着欺騙虚僞的手段藉以競爭，那可以毫不遲疑的説，「死路就在眼前」。</p>
<p>希望商界從此走上正直的競爭之途，把眼光放得遠大，先充實了自己的陣容丨丨儘量的推銷國貨，督促廠家的出品丨丨在大的市塲裏合理的，利益的競爭，發抒本分的競爭。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>開拓國外市場的檢討</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>這也許是我的奢望，在這樣風雨飄搖的國貨前途，一般生產界，正在嚷銷路薄弱，存貨屯積，抵制舶來和振興國產不易的當兒，而我却竟要進一步地提出「開拓國外市塲探討」的問題，「痴人説夢」，好像是做不到的事，但仔細想來，却不盡然，這正是我們很好的機會，假定我們能本着「多銷一分國產，就是增加國家一分元氣」的精神，去努力邁進，並規定一個嚴密，確切的計劃，那末，它於我們的希望，理想，總是漸漸會接近的。</p>
<p>我們知道，在過去及現在，國外是有着不少的僑胞，他們都在很熱烈地切望祖國，需求國貨，而這次荷印巴逹維亞的宋總領事，和新加坡商會代表黄曼士兩君的到滬上來，他倆殷望於我國貨界者，尤有這種懇切的表示，所以，我們對於菲列賓嘉年華會的參加，大規模新加坡國展會的籌備，也確是成了最近國貨推銷海外的先聲，不過，我們除努力於這開拓先導的任務外，我覺得，還有幾個根本的問題，要急需獲得解决和實行，現在，我就提出最値得大家討論的三個來：</p>
<p>（一）出口貨的改良與提倡新出口貨　在這世界工業競爭劇烈的時候，我們謀發展國際貿易的第一要素，當然是改良舊的出品，和廣察各國需要，提倡種類繁多的新出口貨，務使技術改進，出品精美，而製造成本减輕，售價低廉，可易於推銷。</p>
<p>（二）免税出口及統制出口貿易，以現下各國的高築關税壁壘，實是國產出口的一大難題，所以，目下我人第一步所需求的，應爲政府的免税出口，然後可再與政府聯絡合辦，創設一大規模的出口貿易公司，綜攬我全國出口貨物，而加以合理化的統制，將具體的計劃，隨時確定業務方針，謀整個開拓國外市塲。</p>
<p>（三）出口時的種種技術問題　像出口貨品的如何包裝，航運與銀行押匯的手續，匯兑上弊制的預算，貨品樣本的編製，廣告宣傳和銷售方法，這許多出口時的技術問題，我們因過去很少研究，於目下自必先加考慮，然後可易着手進行。</p>
<p>其他，尙有我們應曉得的，就是現下政府也很有這種新的傾向，國際貿易局並召集各國貨廠商，討論恊助推銷辦法，而又適値日貨在到處碰壁的時候，所以，這正是天賦與我們的好機會，必須要趁時去努力幹一下，千萬不可坐失呢！</p>

<h3>國貨商標樣品展覽</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本市婦女國貨年運動委員會，以婦女國貨年行將結束，特假南市文廟路民衆敎育館大成殿舉行國貨商標樣品展覽會，蓋提倡國發，須先使一般民衆認識國貨，則購買貨品時不致受奸商之欺騙，而誤購外貨。以前各種國貨展覽會，均注重貨品方面，對於商標不甚重視，致愛用國貨之同胞，一次購用後，二次再欲採辦是項貨品，因忘却商標，而無從再購者，已數見不鮮，故此次主商標與樣品同時並列，則參觀者易容記憶，法良意美，足資取法。次日各報限於篇幅，僅登大槪情形，爰不憚煩瑣，將各報未詳之處，補錄如下：會期自十二月十四日起，至十六日止，計三天，籌成於第一日上午十時前往，見「祀孔彝器陳列所」匾額之下，黨國旗成交义形，靣加懸「國貨商標樣品展覽會陳列所」白布横額，遇該會辦事員倪拜言君，導往參觀，語頗謙遜，略謂此次决定商標與樣品同時陳列於一處者，使參觀者便於辨識，易於記憶耳。先期規定陳列物件之種類，由各廠自行設計，携帶本商標之出品，標明價格牌號及原料配合用法説明等，赴會登記，依次編排，指定地位，由其自行派員到塲佈置，以昭公允，柱上遍貼「先生你看他家不是全家用國貨麽，」及「若非國貨越是華麗越是羞恥」等標語，孔子神龕前，以木板搭成長桌，鋪以台毯，將商標樣品，各按指定之一位而陳列，爭奇鬥勝，僉用藝術化方法，以引人入勝，如中國國貨公司，將其商標綉於尺半闊三尺長之淡黄素緞上，下垂排鬚，高懸彝器玻璃橱之上，入門卽見，最爲觸目，所出之桌上小鋼琴，僅一尺見方，按之鏗然有聲，抑揚宛轉，竟與披阿那相仿：亞浦耳電器廠，於電風扇之旁，　方盤一，上插各種燈泡，可以試騐電力之高下，燈光之大小，忽明忽暗，人皆注意：五和織造廠，除繪綠水白鵝之布景，高懸於「聖神天縱」硃漆匾額之下外，並將所出之鵝牌棉毛衫與衛生衫，穿於木架之上，按其大小，依次排列，遠視之，不啻小學生在體操時所成之横隊然：冠生園除陳列各種糖果外，並將生字商標，供於橱頂，而將愛國女學任秀羣女士嗜食奶油太妃糖之照放大，植立桌旁，手持糖袋，笑容可掬，天眞爛漫，奕奕如生。女學生經過其地，咸駐足詳視而不忍遠離，致觀者如堵，其他如美亞織綢廠之各種綢樣，五光十色，亞光製造公司之電木電玉器具，光滑清潔，美不勝收，不及細舉，一言蔽之，各種貨品，較之同樣之舶來品，有過之無不及，望參觀諸君牢記商標，購辦試用，方不負該會舉行是會之用意。</p>

<h3>聖誕老人的禮物</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>轉輪般的歲月，又把那冬令轉到了。冷風是呼呼的吹着，吹得那些人們縮着頸，袖着手：吹得那些樹木秃着頂，光着頭；吹得那太陽黯淡無光，發不出平時的威嚴；吹得那天空彤雲密佈，似是釀雪天氣。再吹着，吹着，吹來了一個舶來令節耶穌聖誕，丨外國冬至丨。</p>
<p>黄大方那小孩子，年祇十一歲，已讀畢初小功課，今年已是高小一年級了。他的爹娘是基督徒，所以所逢聖誕的前一夜，買些貴重的禮物送給他。事前不給大方知道，趁他在這晚睡熟，把那些東西裝在一隻大的襪袋裏，吃的像巧格立糖，咖啡糖，牛奶糖：玩的像洋囝囝，小汽車，小飛機，應有盡有，把這襪袋掛在大方的床頂上。等到大方醒來，睡眼惺忪，便瞧見這袋禮物。他快樂得直跳起來，捧着這袋的禮物，故意的問道：「這可愛的禮物，是誰送給我的？」他媽回答道：「聖誕老人。」大方又問：「聖誕老人是怎樣的一位人呢？」他媽又道：「是一位穿着大袍，戴着尖帽，鬚髮雪白的老人。」大方又説道：「媽呀！這位老人來時，爲甚不呌醒我，讓我瞧瞧他面貎；而且親自道謝一聲呢！」媽媽噗哧的笑起來道：「用不着你道謝的，我們已經給你致謝了！」年復一年，大方也知道這是爹媽弄的玄虚，可是不戳穿他，以傅爹娘的歡心。在這幾天，大方知道他爹娘又在預備他聖誕節的禮物了，便向他爹娘説道，「這兩年是國貨年，我們吃的，穿的，用的，都應當買國貨。便是我們小孩子玩的器具，也應當用國貨。校中的先生也同我們説過：今年因爲有許多不愛國的兒童，不用國貨，單就玩具一項，已有幾十萬元進口了。這樣説來，中國的貧窮，我們做小孩子的，也有一分責任咧！並且明年是定爲學生國貨年了，我是小學生中的一分子，倘仍玩那舶來的玩具，吃那舶來的糖果，不但是喪失我堂堂大中華國民的人格；而且是害羣之馬，人人可得而誅咧丨所以令年聖誕老人要是送給我國貨的禮物，我是非但感謝他的隆情；而且還要把他做誠意服用國貨的紀念品。倘仍把以前的舶來品送給我，我要把這東西丢在垃圾桶内咧！他爹娘聽了這番話，不住的點頭，贊他眞有志氣。</p>
<p>一霎眼聖誕夜到了，大方仍照去年的樣子，安穏的睡在他的床上。明天醒來，一包禮物，在他旁邊。他拆開一看，見是一套學生裝，是三友實業社出品；還有許多糖果，都是冠生園和泰豐公司的出品，他看了快活得了不得。在許多東西的下邊，還附着一張卡片，上寫着幾行字道：「這些國貨禮物，是送給我愛國的</p>
<p>學生黄大方，愛國的聖誕老人具。」</p>
<p>一週間國貨界新訊</p>
<p>▲國際貿易局，昨日召集對南洋有關係之出口商，討論發展南洋貿易問題。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「作品與生活的關係」的我見</h3>
<p>— 先河</p>
<p>作品與生活的關係，是很密切的，這幾乎是大家都承認的事實。但前幾天有位周毓英先生却提出三點意見，表示反對，立論很有些值得高榷的地方，因此我也簡單地寫出幾點來就正於周先生。</p>
<p>第一點，周先生提出「想像」的重要。他説「由想像構成文學的實體，而發揮出熱烈的感情丨通過某種思想的感情」。又説「想像只有深刻圓滑和浮淺惡劣的分别，决没有生活充實不充實的分别」。可見周先生是反對生活須要充實，和生活充實對於想像的影響。如果照這個説法，那末一個作家只要有强烈的想像力，就儘可坐在「亭子間或大洋樓里」寫作了，因爲想像會發揮出熱烈的感情，而文學又是「終究是以感情爲中心的一種學科」，這豈不是方便得很嗎？可是事實上是不是這樣簡單？不論是想像力怎樣豐富的作家吧，如果没有一點實生活的體騐，那末他那空空洞洞的腦袋里，能够憑空地想像出什麽花樣？周先生一面説「不過想像也不能離開了眞實的一般的生活」，一面却又否認生活充實不充實與想像深刻不深刻的密切關係，眞敎人不解。荷馬的詩，托爾斯泰的小説，只是他們想像的結晶，還是他們那時代的社會生活的反映，是可以徴諸史實的。至於周先生以爲「到了近代的進步的文學出現，才在文學中加入了思想的要素」，彷彿以前所有的作品，都只是一團混沌的感情，抽象而不着邊際的東西，這究竟是不是事實？所謂「近代」以前的作家，是不是只是一些毫無所爲的，簡簡單單的，只知喜怒哀樂，只知揩鼻涕流眼淚的小娃娃？</p>
<p>在第二段中，周先生舉出中外的很多作家，他説茅盾葉紹鈞諸家的作品，並不全是私生活的記錄，這是很對的。可是周先生有時把「實際生活」只解爲狹義的「私生活」，有時却又機械地分開，是不正確的看法。因爲人是社會的動物，他的社會關係是很複雜的，除了他本身直接所受的經騐，還有更廣泛的，範圍更大的「一般生活」。所謂「體騐生活」，並不一定就是「親自生活過來的私生活」，所謂「充實生活」，却正是要求一個作家要有各方面的生活智識，澈底完備的生活智識。一個作家必定要從侷促的私生活的圈子里解放出來，放大眼光。他得善於觀察（Ｏｂｓｅｒｖｅ）各色各樣的生活，而且對於他所選擇的題材，要有一點不含糊的了解。機械的去了解「直接生活的經騐」，是容易使人誤會的，其實什麽事情都要直接的親身經過，是不可能的事。但曾經親身經騐過的生活，更能够寫得親切動人，却始終是眞理。就是我所説的「觀察」，也决不是抽象的方法。周先生不從這些地方去理解，却抛開了作家所處的社會環境，所有的社會關係，而且不根據歷史的觀點，而要求不是「近代」的巴爾札克和不是美術能力去描寫别種故事，好像辛克萊的描寫一個煤油大王的毁滅，描寫炭坑和屠塲的慘苦」，這誠如周先生自己所説的一樣：「恐怕是不合理的要求吧」？</p>
<p>至於第三點，周先生着重指出的還是「想像」。不過他自己也説：「···逼得在亭子間裏大洋樓裏去想像社會的事情，想像力强的人本可寫出一點若有其事的作品來，想像力幼稚的便只能愚笨地説狂，作口完全失去眞實性了」，可見「想像」的不可靠，一個作家如要加强他的「想像」，不使他的「想像」變成虚無縹渺的「幻想」，使作品只能逹到「若有其事」的境地，或竟至完全失去眞實性，那必得丨又是借用周先生自己的話丨不能離開眞實的一般的生活，換名話説，就是他要勇敢地積極地「參加生活」，「體騐生活」，「充實生活」。所以周先生這段「異議」並没有能够取消「充實生活」對於「思想深刻」的重要，却反而加强了意義。但在下結論的時候，周先生却又很奇怪地一轉，抽象地提出「作家的能力問題」，説是作品的成功與否，完全要看作家的能力如何。我並不反對作家的「能力」，但能力並不是什麽神秘的法寳，决不能這樣憑空的提出來講，更不能倒果爲因，加它以絶對的决定的意義。周先生似乎也反對地些專寫身邊瑣事的，近視的作家，説他們的寫作方法是「取巧」，這也是不錯的，但我早已説過，我們决不能以爲零碎抓一點斷片經騐丨個人的私生活，就算是什麽「充實」和「體騐」，我們不能看漏了「體騐」和「經騐」的區别。</p>
<p>總之，我認爲「作家能力論」是不成立的，如果脱離了實際生活而談什麽抽象的玄秘的「能力」，那不免是空談。</p>
<h3>「世俗之病」</h3>
<p>— 楊世驥</p>
<p>劉融齊贊美王摩詰詩，謂無「世俗之病」，他所指出的世俗之病是：「恃才騁學，做身份，好攀引。」這三項我以爲拿來指摘今日文藝界的一般的情形，也是很受用很適宜的，雖然世俗之病的病態决不止此。</p>
<p>恃才騁學原是許多人希望膺獲的名目，因爲有才可恃，有學可騁，該何等值得驕傲！流風所及，凡有一點小聰明的，無不擺出他那一副才人學士的臉孔來，今日文藝界我們如果發現了一兩篇較好的出產，或一兩句較爲精透和一新耳目的議論的話，接着我們便可看見那作者發揚出他的什麽Ｉｓｔ什麽Ｉｓｍ一類的大道理來，於是垂目睥睨，儼然自己已登了檀木之龕，那神態的佯狂是有走遍三山五獄的江湖客之尊大的。然而其下意識追求這個頭衡的技術却不甚簡單，譬如我要出人頭地，我可以故作乖僻之見，以駭當世；也可以持一事一物或一人爲對敵，力毁其事實上的成績；也可以無中生有，替自己製造一些大膽稱心的軼聞韵事也可以甜言惑衆，曰此處「包羅萬象，應有盡有。」這些都是能够直接或間接顯示自己的才赡學博的。</p>
<p>寫到這里，「才」之爲物的有無，在今日我倒以爲是値得考慮的了；但是我們可説，也許生理上資質的高下，就是所謂才罷，而那些薄才難恃而欲騁學的英雄，其醜態自然不免小足大履之譏了。</p>
<p>如果才與學的裝璜是可誇耀而作爲某種人之目的的話，「做身份」就是逹到這目的的手段之一了。身份影響於我的做人的範式之大，是隨處都有例子可以摭拾的。士紳階級的壯嚴道岸，是他們所自矜的身份；庶民們的委瑣齷齪，是他們被在上者所點派的身份，這樣的身份永久奠定！他們之間貴賤的隔閡；而才人學士的身份又是怎樣的呢！才人學士的類别殊多，故其身份亦各别，在林林總總的狀態之下，大抵依每個人的欲求而去努力打扮，正和演戲一樣，飾淨必塗朱抺漆，飾旦必撲粉施脂，飾楚霸王必豹頷虎鬚，飾漢丞相必綸巾羽扇，否則便要與所裝扮的脚色不相符合的。准於此，夫「風流」，夫「高雅」，夫「狂」，夫「病」，遂爲用至大，而作爲我們才子學士，飛黄騰逹的最上工具了。</p>
<p>「好攀引」是與做身份相辅爲用的，「我的朋友××」雖有人道破，「我們的前身袁宏道」却尙是無人聽見的，要有身份，少不了攀引，以鞏固自己的基礎，以增加自己的冠冕，其理至明，何用喋喋，但所可詫者乃在言行上相逆的忸怩耳。</p>
<p>本文　　齊的唾餘，作無謂的註釋，　也是終於攀引的心理所　罷。</p>
<h3>牛痘與麻藥（續）</h3>
<p>— 喬峯</p>
<p>在科學史上和醫學史上同樣有名，在人生的利益上和牛痘相似的更有麻藥的發見。凡是神經系統愈發逹的動物也愈怕痛，雖然因了個人的體格不同，及風俗習慣和想頭的不同，怕痛和忍痛的力量會有差别，但是人類畢竟是最怕痛的生物是没有疑義的。是麻藥還没有發見的時候，較大的手術便不能施，便是瘡疽開刀，病者也要感到很大苦痛，現在有了麻藥，很重大的割症也能够醫治了。</p>
<p>麻藥的發見，普通都歸功於美國波士頓的牙科醫生摩爾登（Ｗ·Ｔ·Ｇ·Ｍｏｒｔｏｎ），時間是在一八四六年。但是追溯它的歷史，是很古老的。歐洲在古代的時候，偶然已經用麻藥：有時用大麻（Ｈｅｍｐ），有時用蔓陀羅（Ｍａｎｄｒａｋｅ）。十三世紀時候的意大利，曾用一種蔓陀羅Ｍａｎｄｒａｇｏｒａ）作麻藥。一七八二年波蘭王奥古斯吐司（Ａｕｇｕｓｔｕｓ施割症時也曾用過麻藥但在古時候，有時候用，有時候又不用，像現在的廣用，是在摩爾登的發見以後了。</p>
<p>這先前，在一七八七年的時候，兑飛爵士，自己試騐，吸入稱爲「笑氣」的　的氣化物，他雖然没有吸到失却知覺的程度，但他相信笑氣可以用作麻藥的，可供外科施手術時的應用。</p>
<p>到了一八一八年，别一個名人，即法拉兑，説以脱的氣可以麻醉人，稍後，美國的幾個醫生，也這樣説過，只是不曾廣被採用。</p>
<p>又隔了若干年，到了一八四四年，美國康内的吉省的牙醫生威爾士（Ｈ·Ｗｅｌｌｓ）用笑氣給人拔牙齒，但是結果不很成功，他的勇氣消失了，不再試下去。他想改用以脱，自己試了一下，覺得不舒服，又放棄了。</p>
<p>威爾士的試騐雖然是失敗的，但他把這事情去告訴波士頓的牙醫摩爾登。摩爾登對於此事很熱心，並且覺得以脱比笑氣好，遂拿以脱來試騐。他不徨試騐動物，並且試騐拔牙齒。他的試騐的結果使他相信以脱是可以用作良好的麻藥的。一八四六年的時候，他把這事去告訴波士頓的外科醫生華倫，要求有機會時試騐他的發見，於是在馬賽居塞的病院裏，用以脱作麻藥，割去一個病人的項頸上的瘤，結果很良好。自此以後，以脱的用作麻藥，遂漸次流行起來了。</p>
<p>以脱可做麻藥的發見，實際上並不只有摩爾登一人。在差不多的時候，波士頓的化學家捷克遜也發見以脱可作麻藥的。並且喬治亞的一個小鎭上的醫生郎博士（Ｄｒ·Ｃ·Ｌｏｎｇ），在一八四二年春季，用以脱作麻藥，也割去個病人的頭上的瘤，以後還繼續的應用。只因爲摩爾登的試騐知道的最多，傳播的較廣，因此説起麻藥的發見，往往連帶的説起他的名字來了。</p>
<p>到了以脱用作麻藥的發見發表以後，蘇格蘭有一個外科醫生，荀卜遜爵士（Ｓｉｒ　ＪａｍｅｓＳｉｍｐｓｏｎ），知道法國有人試騐動物時，曾用𠹭囉仿作麻藥，他遂拿去試騐，發見𠹭囉仿用於外科手術上結果的良好。於是以脱以外，又增添了𠹭囉仿這一種麻藥了。</p>
<p>於人生有益的發見，此外還很多，這裏只説了一點點，將來的人進步上去，不再在鴉片，打牌及各種賭博上去消磨功夫，也不再把能力費在「爭田奪地」和搜括金錢上，並且不再眼睛血血紅的在想殺人的方法；把用在無用的，及有害方面的力量移過來用在各項探究和發明上必定還能够發見許多和發明許多於人生極有利益的東西和方法，這是當然的事情。（完）</p>
<h3>蹴生活一脚</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>在看過了孤西先生的「打生活一下耳光」一文之後，使我非常同感，而且，還感覺應該狠狠地蹴它一脚。</p>
<p>是的，對於生活，我們「應該拗起硬朗的態度，」丨「彷彿不啻將它打一下耳光那麽的地去做人！」因爲丨</p>
<p>這個時代，是個苦難的時代，鬥爭的時代。活在這時代裏，我們就應該有崛强的精神去對付我們的生活。</p>
<p>我們不但需要有燎火般灼燃底鬥爭的情緒，而且，在我們的生活中去體騐，去磨難，去訓練，去建設。</p>
<p>民族的危機已經一步一步臨近我們的眼前了。誰甘願匍匐於桎梏之下，誰永遠便是奴隷？</p>
<p>然而，有誰甘願爲奴隷呢？</p>
<p>時代的狂潮在怒吼着。我們要隨着這洶湧的浪波突進。</p>
<p>也許這一塲巨潮會把我們淹没的。</p>
<p>也許這一塲巨潮會把我們粉碎的。</p>
<p>也許這一塲巨潮會把我們冲上山的高峯，地的絶角。</p>
<p>也許這一塲巨潮會把我們湧到自由榮華的大地啊！</p>
<p>然而，不論怎的，我們在這時代裏，從個人方面説，在狂流的巨潮中不過是股渺小的泡沫，宇宙中的一點微塵而已。然而從大體上説，我們集合起來，這就是一個雄偉的巨人啊！</p>
<p>此刻圍繞在我們週圍的一切，不是充滿着醜惡，殘暴，災難，苦惱，黑暗，窮窘，饑饉…？</p>
<p>我們還能够留戀什麽？</p>
<p>我們應該負起責任。</p>
<p>路雖然是崎嶇的，險峻的，遙遠的，艱難的。</p>
<p>但終有到逹的時候啊！</p>
<h3>化裝品的奴棣</h3>
<h3>明天（二）（十）（一）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Cornad）著吳向隅譯</p>
<p>「停下，」她大聲喊。「不要走開。」</p>
<p>頭放平了用心傾聽，她不能辨别倒究是大風的猛襲，還是他的是以左右命運的脚步刺傷她的心。不久各種聲音都變爲聽不見了。她也像變爲石人似的。這深重的沉寂的恐懼到她的心上來丨丨比死的恐懼還可怕。她提起了她的逐漸消失的力量作最後的呼喊：</p>
<p>「哈利！」</p>
<p>即是在消减的脚步的回聲也没有了　。一切都没有了。波濤的澎湃，永遠流動的海自己的聲音也似乎停止了。没有一些聲音丨丨－－没有生命的響動，像煞她是孤單的，孤單的迷失於她所聽到的那個多石的地方一樣，那兒那些瘋人去尋找金子與棄掉他們的金礦。</p>
<p>海格波特船長，在他的黑暗的屋裏，一直留心着。一扇窗又揭開了；在這宛如多石的地方的沉寂空氣中，有一個聲音在她的頭上響了，高高在那黑暗的空氣中丨丨瘋狂謊騙絶望的聲音－－同時也是永久充滿希望的聲音「他去了没有丨那個報信的傢伙？你聽他講及些什麽，我的親愛的？」</p>
<p>她忽然流淚。「不！不！不！我不再聽他了，」她啜泣着説。</p>
<p>他開始勝利地呵呵大笑。「你嚇走他麽。好的女孩子。現在我們將一復如前。不要心急，我的親愛的。再等一天。」</p>
<p>在别座小屋裏，老嘉維爾坐在一張放在近桌子的球形的燈的旁邊的圈椅中很神氣地轉動一下，用一種兇惡的聲音，大聲呼喊她：「貝珊！貝珊！你，貝珊！」</p>
<p>最後，她聽到了，像被命運宰制了一樣，她開始沉；默地走向她的鬱悶的那間小地獄般的屋中去。這地獄没不高大的門闌，没有可怕的被剝奪掉希望的碑文－她也不知道她所犯何罪。</p>
<p>海格波特船長逐漸在上面陷於瘋狂的快樂狀態。</p>
<p>「滚進去！不要閙！」她從下面的門　上流淚滿面地斥責他。</p>
<p>他因爲認爲以前「有些事不對」到了最後已經解除因而十分快樂的原故，並不聽她的命令。這樣一來，那老頭子的永遠相信「明天」的呼聲，像煞一切世界上所有的有希望的狂想都爆發出來帶了恐怖到她的心上一樣。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>養大胖兒子</h3>
<p>— 無聊</p>
<p>十六日，美國聖太蒙尼加電：「銀幕熱女郎古萊拉寳，今日在此間醫院中，產生一孩，重八磅，其夫勒克斯貝爾，亦爲銀幕明星云」。旣是有夫之婦，必能生育，故生育原是很平凡的一件事，現在美國的女明星克萊拉寳，產生了一個大胖兒子，竟値得新聞記者如此注意，發電宣傳，「是亦不可以已乎」。</p>
<p>「男女媾精，萬物化生」，原是造化自然之理，卽如美國而論，每日小國民的產生數量，不知凡幾，多是毫無所聞，而獨於小明星的產生，極爲重視，幾等於大總統之產生小總統，王太子之產生小王子，則美人之崇拜明星，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>我國的江北婆，一手拿了一只籃，一手拿了一根棒，沿門求乞，口中還大唱其「蓮花落」，忽然肚子裏覺得一陣疼痛，一陣難過。便在人家墻角邊，產生了一個小乞兒。自己包包紥紥，懹在身邊，一點無人注意，少頃，還是沿門求乞而去，這也是產生的一個大胖兒子呢。</p>
<p>還有「大亨」「小亨」之流，不曉得第幾位如夫人，忽然「弄璋有慶」，「一索得男」，於是大發其帖，大請其客，什麽湯餅之讌呀，什麽晬盤之宴呀，高朋滿座，珠履盈門，恭喜恭喜之聲，洋溢乎屋宇，在親朋們不免也大破其鈔，禮劵呀，金器呀，綢緞呀，各稱其情之厚薄，力所能爲，前去報效，眞是寃哉枉也。</p>
<p>語曰「不要看小兒產生，祇要看老來收成」因爲修短之數，原是莫測，而死生天壽，更無定期，并且所生的大胖兒子，他日爲要人呢？爲盜賊呢？爲英勇的戰士呢？爲出風頭的明星呢？爲沿門托鉢的乞丐呢？又難預料，這樣説來，一大胖兒子的代價，究値若干？方生幼時，怎可推測其將來的結果，則慶祝誕生，原是絶對没有意義。</p>
<p>方當現在的我國，經濟没落，農村破產，商業凋零，生計日拙，個人生活，尙難維持，子女担負，更不易給，如此多增一個子女，卽多加一重担負，因此有養而不舉的，有養而抱入育婴堂中去的，比比皆是，則生兒果然可慶呢？還是可吊呢？亦尙在不可知之數。</p>
<p>旣生兒女，須授敎育，倘若不受敎育，不是他日爲乞兒，便爲社會不良份子，而在我國能受高等敎育的，旣屬不多，不但能受高等敎育，卽尋常一個初高中畢業生，其敎育之費，已須若干，如此貴族化的敎育，若當局不加注意，一任「學店老闆高抬價格，我恐以後非但能受高等敎育的，絶無其人，卽受低級敎育的，也頗不易，如此國民份子，更是不齊，國家文化，日益没落，而生男育女，最爲人生的一件担心事呢，可歎。</p>

<h3>流亡</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>是一個初冬的晚上，車站上的電燈已放了光明，嘈雜的人聲充塞着整個車站，各式各樣的人都不住地在那兒流動。脚夫們却忙着向旅客搶行李搬取，許多小販都拉長了聲調在呌賣東西幾個路警和憲兵都執着了一根鞭子，在站内外來回逡巡。四等車的售票窗前，擠着一大堆不十分漂亮的人；衹看見一堆人頭在强烈的電燈光下波動，這情形正彷彿施粥廠前的鐖餓羣衆。</p>
<p>女友也擠了上去，好容易才買到了二張半到上海的四等票；他揑着票子，駝着一個包袱，掮着一個舖蓋，他的老婆也提着一籃零星物件，抱了兒子阿狗，走向軋票處去。但那軋票員偏偏要和他們爲難，説這末大的舖蓋不能帶上車，後來經他再三的哀求，總算放了他們過去。穿過一層地道，到對面月臺上，四等乘客是那麽多，然而都是同他們一樣，扶老携幼的，從被災的故鄉裏流亡出來的。</p>
<p>這是一班八點零七分的三四等慢車，可是現在將近九點鐘了，車子還没有來，人都噪了起來，阿狗也嚷着要吃夜飯，雖他媽和爸的肚子也着實餓了，還是早上出門時各人喝了一碗薄粥，和幾隻山芋，到如今冷水還没喝過，肚子裏自然要咕嚕咕嚕的不舒服了；可是現在到那兒去找夜飯來吃呢？聽聽别個孩子也同樣地在哭嚷。</p>
<p>「阿狗，乖乖不要吵，我們到了上海去吃麵去，不要哭！」阿狗媽痛苦地哄着他。他聽了吃麵，便把一隻骯髒的手伸進了小嘴裏去呧吮着，瘦臉上露出了一絲希望的微笑。但是停了不久他又似乎感到了失望，並且没有一個破茅蓬的家，從他小心靈中浮出來。</p>
<p>「媽！我們怎不回去呢？回到家裏去睡呀！」他向媽吵。</p>
<p>才友正在想那個被天災人禍所襲擊的家，不覺眼眶子裏有些潤濕，看看他老婆，看看那個無知的不幸孩子，他想要是家鄉能够生活，何至於要逃荒到那人地生疎的上海去？到了上海又是舉目無親的，將怎樣安排呢？餓死在上海，還不是餓死在家裏一樣嗎？動身的時候祇帶了四塊八角錢，現在除去了盤費，只剩三塊錢也不到了，怎麽辦？他心裏這樣想着，便覺得眼前已給一面恐怖的屏障遮住了，望不到前面是一個怎麽樣的世界。他不敢往下想了；到了上海假使找不到工做，還不是一樣的去餓死！好吧！就餓死在上海也總比餓死在家裏有出息的多，反正這個年頭兒，到處就没有我們窮人的生路！</p>
<p>他把眼光無力地在他老婆憂鬰的臉上暼了一下，孩子却已睡熟在她懹中；身上雖穿了一件破絮襖，然而究竟太破了，寒感還是像針一般的剌着肌膚。</p>
<p>火車轟隆轟隆的跑來了，「嘎！」的一聲停在月台傍，經過一陣子嚷閙和擠軋，他父子三個也給裝了上去，可把她懹中的阿狗閙醒了。</p>
<p>「媽！爸！我要回家去吃飯呀！」阿狗又不知趣的哭嚷了起來。</p>

<h3>一幅寫眞</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>街上，冷清清地有三個人走着。没有黄包車，也没有一個紐頭縮頸的巡警。</p>
<p>「爸爸！我可不能再走了。」</p>
<p>小孩兒冰冷的手，去拖住爸爸的衣服。</p>
<p>「孩子！一會兒就到舅舅的家了。不要去跟你爸爸閙。過來，我來抱你！」</p>
<p>她抱起了八歲的小孩兒。</p>
<p>爸爸的臉上出着熱氣。死勁地挑了二只箱子，在街上走。</p>
<p>「媽！城裏怎麽也是冷靜的呵？」</p>
<p>孩子伏在媽的肩上問。</p>
<p>「冷天的晚上，城裏跟我們鄉下一個樣的。」</p>
<p>「那末，爸爸説謊了！他説，城裏無論早上，晚上，總是花花綠綠的。」</p>
<p>「不要多開口！嘴裏吹進了冷風，是要咳嗽的！」</p>
<p>「唔。」</p>
<p>他抿了嘴，答應了。於是，更靜寂啦。</p>

<p>二雙脚，在街上走着。没有喊賣夜報的，也没有那賣糖粥的。</p>
<p>「唉。轉一個彎，就是了！」</p>
<p>男的嘆着氣，説。</p>
<p>轉一個彎，轉二個彎，他們已經走了一天了！早晨，在家裏打掃好後，一家人就開始出發的。中飯没有吃，夜飯也没有錢買，只得餓着肚子走路。</p>
<p>他們都想着舅舅！</p>
<p>舅舅是一個活財神。他會帮着他們找職業。假如没有舅舅，一直住在家裏，是會餓死的！最後的一條末路，就是找住在城裏的舅舅去！</p>
<p>丨天爺雖不作福，使我們苦到這步田地。可是，還有他一點兒良心。使我有一個哥哥丨</p>

<p>「誰？」</p>
<p>打了一會兒，才有人來問。</p>
<p>「我們來找趙阿福的！」</p>
<p>「趙阿福嗎？他已經不住在這裏了。」</p>
<p>「唔？怎麽會不住在這裏的？」</p>
<p>「搶了人家的東西，給關進牢裏去了！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>二個人在門外，相對望了望。没開口。裏面的人也没有聲音。</p>
<p>停了一刻，女的打着那扇門，説：</p>
<p>「怎麽？怎麽…他什麽時候會出來？」</p>
<p>裏面的鼾聲，隠約的在傳出來了！</p>
<p>「喂！不要再去打門了！」</p>
<p>丈夫失望的坐在階沿上，説。</p>
<p>×</p>
<p>又是一個晚上。</p>
<p>妻，穿得很漂亮的，臉上塗滿着脂粉，她同許多女人都站在街的角邊。一個老太婆跟着她。她裝着笑臉，對那些男的行人。有時，她會這樣的開口。</p>
<p>「喂！到我家裏去玩玩吧？」</p>
<p>這聲音，充滿了恥羞，悲痛！</p>
<p>在一條黑衖子裏，丈夫伴着孩子在吃餑子。</p>
<p>「爸爸！媽到那兒去了？」</p>
<p>「回到鄉下去替你拿棉衣了。」</p>
<p>爸，哄騙着一個天眞的孩子。</p>
<p>「這餑子，媽也是喜歡吃的哪！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「爸，爲什麽你哭了？」</p>
<p>「孩子！我不哭！我覺得眼睛痛罷了！咦，爲什麽你不吃了？」</p>
<p>「我不吃了！這二個我要留給媽吃！」</p>
<p>他乖巧的藏進袋子裏去。</p>
<p>爸望着他，不禁又掛下了一串淚珠！</p>

<h3>欺侮弱者最可恥</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我在去年春天，進了一家連家店的洋貨號做學徒。進店不久，卽大受老闆的兩個兒子的欺侮。他們有時打我一下，有時拍我一下，或向我吐一痰，種種無理的舉動，實在是受够了，告訴老闆（他們的父親）吧，又恐怕引起不好的結果，所以我很難過。昨天下午我坐在椅子上，他們又跑過來，無緣無故的拿了一根很長的碼尺，照凖我的身體就打，一個在旁喊打。我被他們打了五六下，實在忍不住了，便把碼尺奪下，不給他們打了。不料他們隨卽都哭起來了，於是老闆就跑出來，將我大駡一頓，説我欺侮他們，實在呌我有寃無處伸。當時我受了這個剌激，眞要去自殺，後來一想，爲了這點小事去自殺是不値得的，所以没有實行。不過遭遇這樣的環境，呌這怎樣辦呢？先生，請你給我一個答覆吧！敬祝　　撰安　　鮑珊上</p>
<p>編者按：欺侮弱者是社會上普有的現象，在一切不同的社會層裏，都有這種事情發生，像鮑君現在的遭遇，不過是其中最輕微的一種吧了。</p>
<p>我們要勸鮑君對於此事不必過於掛懹。假使你認爲是莫大的恥辱，而想去自殺，那更是最不智的行爲。因爲小孩是無知的，你何必去和這種小孩計較？就是你向他們反抗，得到了勝利，又有什麽意思？所以對於此事，你只有暫時忍耐，或設法避免和他們見面，他们也就無從欺侮你了。</p>
<p>當然，你對於現在的痛苦的環境如認爲是不能再生活下去了，那末你可以托人另謀職業，設法掉換一個環境。不過在没有找到相當的位置以前，爲了求職業技能的關係，暫時是以忍耐爲上策。</p>
<p>在另一方面，我們是得欺侮弱者實在是一種最可恥的事情，有這種壤的習慣的人，都應積極糾正自己的鎖誤。像小孩時代更不能養成這種不好的心理。這一點希望一般人加以注意。最後我們並希望鮑君及其他。受别人欺侮的人，不要把現在所受到的痛苦，在將來自己勢的時候，發洩到别人的身上去。這種無意思的報復主義也是不應該有的。</p>
<p>梁崇玉·蓮心·受創者·謝仁·曹·秋霞·陸影·方陳氏·碧雲·劉人鏡·萍影·施·章燕帆·柳劍英·諸君鑒：請示通訊處，以便奉覆。</p>

<h3>好萊塢掛召租牌子的明星們的别墅山莊</h3>
<p>— 蜜薺</p>
<p>從大房子搬到小房子，小房子分租，一家變爲兩家，兩家變爲三家，這是上海一二八之戰後，由於經濟没落，所造成的居住狀况。但是現在的經濟没落，是普遍於全世界的，好萊塢當然也不能獨居例外。因此好萊塢的明星們，有紛紛將住宅，别墅，山莊出租的事發生。非但過去的明星，因爲經濟拮据，節省開支起見，不得不將他們的大厦讓給人家住，就是現住的明星們，他們束一所住宅，西一所别墅的，亦勢必割愛，留着好萊塢的房子自己住，而在地點較遠些的房屋出租給别人。這不是和平常人，破敗之後，將餘屋分租給人一樣嗎？要是在經濟没有衰落之前，他們平日住在好萊塢鎭上，星期末住在海濱，休假時住在山莊，每個地方都有碩大無朋的汽車間，馬廐，游泳池，網球塲，花圃，練身房，戲塲等，應有盡有，享盡人間的清福，金錢豈所計及，那有割愛出租之理。到了現在，自從前年銀行紛紛倒閉之後，餓狼已在他們的門口，勢將登堂入室。就是幾個不愁經濟的，看了人家紛紛縮小範圍，撙節日用，亦不敢自誇豪華起來了。現在我們且講幾所大房子明星們的產業，現在都掛着召租的牌子的。</p>
<p>曼琳黛維絲（Ｍａｒｉｏｎ　Ｄａｖｉｓ）在聖他蒙尼卡海濱，有一所别墅，面臨太平洋。那所别墅，不過是她的「客舍」，當然在形式富麗等等，不能和她在聖他蒙尼卡的住宅相比擬的，但是已經有十二間臥室，六間浴室，以至僕役室等。裏面裝置外國來的古董，頗爲幽靜可喜。從前别莉勃克住過，每月租金二千五百美金。現在瑪琳黛德麗許住在裏面，每月月租不過一千五百美金。蓓蓓黛妮兒絲（Ｂｅｂｅ　Ｄａｎｉｅｌｓ）已經成了好萊塢有名的心東太太了。她在海邊上，有三所房子出租。最貴的是月租一千美金，從前波拉尼格里曾經住過。那裏面布置極爲富麗，前面是一片私人的海濱。曼麗璧克馥（ｍａｒｙｐｉｃｋｆｒｄ）大家都知道她的璧克范大夏，是她和范朋克合造的府邸，是一個世界聞名的地方，但是她在海邊上的一所别墅，現在亦掛上了召租牌子了。你要是願意要這位美國的甜心，做你的房東太太的話，你每月付房金六百美金，亦可算是低廉的了。那亦是建築在一個私人沙灘上的。</p>
<p>瑙瑪塔美琪（Ｎｏｒｍａ　Ｔａｌｍａｓｄｇｅ）在十年前，是好萊塢最美麗的紅星了。她現在亦有一所海濱别墅出租。除掉有一碧無際的太平洋，可資浮沉之外，還有一個淡水的游泳池，租金每月不過八百五十美金。薛爾維亞雪妮，現在住的房子，是從李却巴塞爾姆斯（Ｒｉｈａｒｄ　Ｂａｒｔｂｅｍｅｓｓ）手裏租來的。那亦在海邊上，最宜於夏天避暑之居。現在冬令已交，她自己住在好萊塢鎭上，還要將那所大房子，騰出一半分租給人家哩。麗琳哈蕙（Ｌｉｌｉａｎ　Ｈａｒｖｅｙ）自從山上搬下來之後，那所房子，就由曼麗納喜租了下來。但是曼麗納喜現在又要搬了。你如果願意，祇要付月租七百五十美金。那是很便宜的，因爲那所房子是西班牙式的建築，花園圍繞了房子的四週，布置極具匠心。裏面的傢俱，統通是法國運來的，可云精巧絶倫。特别還有一間游戲室，裏面玩具從六袋檯球到乒乓，無不具備。珂琳穆亞（Ｃｏｌｌｅｅｎ　Ｎｏｏｒｅ）在貝爾愛建築的優美住宅，現在亦以一千二百五十元的月租，租給瑪琳黛德麗許了。以上所説的，不過略舉其一二。其餘的亦就無庸一一列舉了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「百花洲」我評</h3>
<p>— 費念祖</p>
<p>無疑的，本片又是類似「紅樓春深」，「春宵曲」這一般的作品，仍舊是一個戀愛糾紛的老調。</p>
<p>本片導演者文逸民，對於處理的技術，和表演的手法，都覺得不够，尤其是對於人物個性的描寫，顯出了重大的缺點；如寫陳玉梅的從事兒童敎育，祇寫她是爲了戀愛的糾紛和誤會。葉秋心的突然轉變，也寫得牛頭不對馬嘴。其餘如余光的前後不符，和葉秋心那種兇暴的態度等，都是顯出導演技術的幼稚。</p>
<p>演員，陳玉梅尙能稱職，可是較前仍没有多大的進步。葉秋心也不能給我們較好的印象。陳綺霞尙可。余光李英平平。</p>
<p>最後我認爲値得一提的，乃是劇作者總算較「紅樓春深」中有了一點進步，因爲「百花洲」中，他除了戀愛的糾紛以外，還加入了些微服務社會的意義。</p>
<h3>「上海廿四小時」觀感</h3>
<p>— 武生</p>
<p>當我在新光大戲院看了沈西苓繼「女性的呐喊」後的這一部「上海廿四小時」，我的心靈上是受到了極度的感動，眞的，當時我的血管幾乎要爆烈了開來。</p>
<p>很顯明的，本片的題材是極現實的，畫面是剌激的，感人的，它是描寫出一般在農村生活的人們，因着農村的破產，没法生存，而憧憬着都市的表面繁華。不錯，都市的正面是美麗的，燦爛的，然而都市的背面却是黑暗的，慘酷的。本片的劇作者就是想在二十四小時内把都市背面的黑暗；被壓在奢侈淫佚生活下的血肉糢糊的慘狀表現出來，給憧憬着都市的人君知道，可是因爲全劇受了環境的影響，改變了它本來的面目，因之，在内容上，在劇力上，都很鬆弛而有支離破碎之感了！</p>
<p>導演運用的手法是値得讚美的。演員的表演，我個人覺得以趙丹的老趙做得最佳，陳凝秋的陳大，周伯勳的買辦亦頗稱職。</p>
<p>佈景頗逼眞，光綫似略暗淡。</p>
<p>明星公司新片「重婚」吳邨導演，高占非嚴月閒高傅蘋主演，本片已定本月二十一日起在新光戲院公映。</p>

<p>作者在這裏告訴我們一個非常悲傷悽慘的故事，在這故事裏。包含着一個重大的社會問題。一個能刻苦耐勞的靑年，竟爲了「公理」和「人道」，而使他失業，使他受到了這樣殘酷的結局。無疑的，這是一部富有社會意義的影片。</p>
<p>導演的技巧的確不差，小聰明處亦很多。對於社會眞實現象却能盡情的暴露，如招考雇員一人，應考者竟有數百人之多。飯店裏有着種種卑鄙齷齪的事情。建平的撕毁文憑，説明了文憑是不能換飯吃的騙人的廢物。演員表情都很深刻，尤以袁牧之和陳波兒爲最。以素來從事舞台劇的導演和演員，初踏上銀幕就有這樣的成績，確是令人驚異，而認爲相當的滿意。</p>
<p>但也有幾個小的缺陷：發音有些地方不十分清楚。建平在獄中，爲什麽没有鐐銬鎖鍊在他的手脚上？最後的字幕是多餘的，而且與劇義並不符合，這大概不是編劇者的本意吧！</p>
<h3>華雷斯皮萊賈克柯柏重度合作「金銀島」</h3>
<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>十九世紀浪漫派文學，專以描寫武俠，探險，愛情等爲宗。大文豪洛勃魯意史帝文遜（Ｒ·Ｌ·Ｓｔｅｖｅｎｓｏｎ），爲此類作風的最後一位作家，是十九和二十世紀文藝思潮分野的標塔。至於她的詩才早經世界認識，而他生平最著名普遍的代表作小説，就是現由南京公映的「金銀島」（Ｔｒｅａｓｕｒｅ　Ｉｒｌａｎｄ）。該書曾經以十數國文字翻譯，而作爲文學愛好者入門的必讀物。即吾國林紓琴南先生，除却爾斯迭更司小説外亦以此書譯成「金銀島」，爲最膾炙人口之作。</p>
<p>米高梅公司攝製此片，耗資逹百萬美金以上。片中人物的選擇，也煞費經營。現在得由「自由萬歲」主角華雪斯皮萊飾郎約翰，神童賈克柯柏飾傑姆霍金斯，里昂巴里摩亞飾瘋船長魯意史東飾史穆勒船長，紇賽爾飾怪人朋根。無疑地，他們的天才，决不會令人失望的。至於背景對白，情調等，以米高梅的信譽，亦足以保證。耶誕令節到了，這兒有最妙最富的第八藝術所貢獻的禮物。</p>

<h3>謹將「重婚」奉獻於都市靑年</h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>「重婚」是吳村加入明星後第一部聚精會神的力作。亦是高占非和高倩蘋夫婦倆初次合作的結晶。當然，這是每個影迷不可不加注意的一部空前的佳片。</p>
<p>該片的内容是描寫一個喝着人生的苦酒，一生辛苦耕耘的老農人，將兒子送到都市裏來讀書，希望能得一官半職，那知這靑年染上了都市的不良的行爲，終歲地悠閒游樂，痛飮着戀愛的甘杯。父子間一貧一富的生活，宛如天壤之隔。這是一部家庭的悲劇的素描畫，也是一部社會的悲劇的剪影。對於都市的浮華的靑年，有着忠實的諷諫，和熱情的勸導，謹將該片奉獻給您們－－都市靑年之前。現該片决定於今日晚上九時一刻，在新光大戲院獻映。</p>
<h3>「重婚」中的一幕</h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>在吳村導演的「重婚」中，有一條大意如此的字幕：「上海有許多許多有名無實的野鷄學校，而這些學校有知葬送了許多有爲的靑年。」</p>
<p>高占非在「重婚」中，便是一個忠實有爲地靑年，而他到上海進了大學後，便染上了都市的不良的行爲，變成一個浮華的靑年了。</p>
<p>每天，當燦爛的夜市開幕時，他穿上了漂亮的西服，與兩三個同學偷偷地爬出學校的牆垣跳舞去了。某夜，當他們跳罷了舞歸來時，適逢大雨，霎時，大家都要成了落湯雞，而狼狽地又從牆垣爬進學校裏來時，其中的一位同學，一不小心失足跌進牆脚底下一個水缸裏面去了，大家都哄然地大笑起來，這時，那些只拿乾薪水的敎員們，正在温柔鄉中。而這些靑年就被他們如此地葬送了。（却）</p>

<h3>百言集</h3>
<p>— 林擒</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>許多人連世界大文豪的國籍都分不清，還要在那高談其世界文學，這是騙活人呢？還是欺死鬼呢？</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council appointed Wang Yongbin as Minister of Judicial Administration on the 19th. Wang will assume his post after the National Government issues a formal decree. According to Wang, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, he is very interested in promoting the examination system. The examination administration is now on the right track, and in another three years, great achievements can be expected. The Central Government's order for him to head the Ministry of Justice is contrary to his long-held wishes. He needs to give considerable thought to whether or not to accept the new appointment.

Furthermore, the appointments of the political and permanent vice ministers of the Ministry of Law are said to have been internally decided and may be announced soon.

Hangzhou has already prepared Jiangzhuang as Huang's residence. Regarding disaster relief, emphasis will be placed on work relief. Emergency relief is also planned. Because there are still remnants of bandits in the border areas, winter defense should be strengthened. Regarding finance, Zhejiang Province has an annual deficit of six million. It is currently planned to gradually reorganize the finances after three months. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Huang Huabiao met with reporters at his lodging on the evening of the 19th and said that Chairman Huang has already drafted an outline of administrative policies for Zhejiang. As far as he knows, the general approach will be to first have a three-month preparation period, after which the entire administrative policy will be determined. The work planned for the preparation period includes: (1) Solving the disaster relief problem. Winter relief will be held, but it will focus on work relief. (2) Paying attention to winter defense in the border counties to ensure social stability. (3) Actively reorganizing the fundamental methods of finance, starting with reorganizing the rural economy. The short-term solution will be to reorganize the tax system, eliminate unnecessary agencies and personnel to avoid wasting manpower and financial resources, and make efforts to reduce expenditures. In terms of administration, efforts will be made to reduce expenditures. In terms of society, frugality must be practiced in matters such as weddings and funerals. (4) Drafting administrative policies. Social surveys will first be conducted by region to fully understand the social realities of the entire province. At the same time, small group meetings of county magistrates will be held to hear each county magistrate's detailed report on each county. These factors will serve as the basis for determining administrative policies after three months. He also said that Chairman Huang will arrive in Hangzhou at noon on the 20th, and the various departments of the provincial government are scheduled to take over the provincial government on the 21st. The wrap-up meeting will be held on the 19th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Drug Trafficking Korean</h3>
<p>Violently Assaults Beiping City Police</p>
<p>Police Chief Bai Changhui Injured</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the promulgation of the Beiping City Anti-Drug Regulations, the Public Security Bureau has ordered its subordinates to vigorously search for drug offenders. Koreans in Beiping City have recently felt that they cannot sell drugs, so they are venting their anger on the local authorities. Last night, at No. 10 Daxihu Tong, Nanshuncheng Street, Fuchengmen Inner City, a Korean named Zhang Shizhe, who has always been in charge of selling white powder in the Xicheng area and earning a very good income, summoned more than 20 Korean colleagues after hearing that the police have been strictly arresting drug offenders recently and that addicts are hesitant to come forward. They bound two people who were going to buy white powder. A Korean went to the fourth section of the fourth district to report a robbery. Bai Changhui, the police chief of the section, led police officers such as Cheng Yongli to the courtyard. Zhang ordered the Koreans holding poles to beat Bai and others. Police Chief Bai and others dodged while blowing whistles to call for help. Soon, police officers stationed at Fuchengmen came to their aid. Director Deng Zhenzhong also rushed to the scene after hearing the report. Bai Changhui and Cheng Yongli had been hit in the head, back, flanks, arms, and other places, and their clothing had also been torn. They were taken to the station to recover.

<h3>Building a Dam on the Yongding River</h3>
<p>Causes a Conflict Among Villagers</p>
<p>(Beiping) The upper section of the fourth section of the south bank of the Yongding River is under the jurisdiction of Liangxiang County, and the north bank is under the jurisdiction of the third district of Wanping County. The villagers on the south bank, because the dam had been in disrepair for many years, obtained permission from the Yongding River Affairs Bureau to build a dam. The villagers gathered more than 50 people on the 12th of this month and began the work of building the embankment. At 2:00 PM on the 13th, while they were working on the riverbank, many people on the north bank suddenly shot at the south bank with rifles. Many people were injured and the rest hid on the ground. The gunshots were dense, about 300 rounds, and the situation was serious. Zhang Zhongyi, the section chief in charge, sent many river soldiers to protect the work. The villagers tried to escape to the section office to hide and sent people to nearby villages on the north bank to inquire about the truth. According to reports, the shooters had fled.

<h3>Salt Monopoly Issue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of salt monopoly, the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance originally planned to hold a salt affairs reform conference before the end of the year to discuss specific measures. However, while the monopoly plan is theoretically beneficial to the reform of salt administration, the various factual problems of salt transport, sales management, and anti-smuggling have been deeply rooted for a long time, making the implementation of the monopoly extremely difficult. At the same time, the Fifth Plenary Session has decided to establish a Salt Administration Reform Committee within a month, with the Minister of Finance as the ex officio chairman. In the future, the committee will have concrete discussions on salt administration reform matters. Therefore, regarding the plan to convene a salt administration conference within the year, it was decided to wait for the Reform Committee to conduct careful discussions, and the opinions of the salt affairs agencies of the ministry will be sent to the committee for research. No further discussions will be held separately. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>

As for the accumulated arrears, they have been newly determined and will be paid off in 30 years, with each payment being 258,904.46 Swiss francs, equivalent to over 258,900 national currency. Therefore, starting next year, our country will pay a total of approximately 1,450,000 national currency per year for dues and repayment of arrears. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>London Pays Attention to China's Silver Problem</h3>
<p>(London) According to the London Financial News, the suggestion made by Sir Sassoon in Shanghai yesterday to solve the silver problem was welcomed by the local market. However, it is felt that the United States may not change its silver policy and act accordingly. The Financial News believes that if the United States does not change its policy to accommodate Chinese interests, China will eventually be forced to devalue its currency in order to protect its trade and avoid the contractionary effects of expensive silver. However, according to Reuters' inquiries, the British in financial circles generally expect that China will not devalue its currency. However, the Americans' opinions on this are not so absolute. Some people also say that China will eventually adopt the pound sterling standard, because China cannot control silver, so using silver as a monetary basis is very unreliable.

<h3>Minami Jiro Goes to Changchun</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Commander of the Kwantung Army and Ambassador to Manchukuo, Minami Jiro, left Tokyo for his post at 9 a.m. this morning. Before his departure, General Minami stated that the Manchurian Incident occurred during his tenure as Minister of the Army. He is deeply grateful to be going to Manchuria as the Commander of the Army and Ambassador to Manchukuo. Japan's policy towards Manchuria respects its independence and promotes its sound development. The fundamental policy is the complete integration of Japan and Manchukuo. The first method is to always respect the independence of "Manchukuo." If the Japanese people regard "Manchukuo" as a protectorate or colony, the prestige of "Manchukuo" will be undermined, which may lead to the division of Japan and Manchukuo. The second method is economic integration. Cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo in economic industries is essential. The development of products in "Manchukuo" requires huge capital. The combination of Japan and Manchukuo requires capital, and developing its industries, increasing revenue, and improving the economic level will strengthen the foundations of both countries.

<h3>Resignation of Yugoslav Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Leads to Cabinet Collapse</p>
<p>Disagreement over League of Nations Compromise Plan</p>
<p>Military Faction Seizes Opportunity to Seize Power</p>
<p>Belgrade: Disagreements among cabinet members regarding the League of Nations' compromise plan for resolving the Yugoslavia-Hungary dispute have led to the collapse of the Yugoslav cabinet today. This crisis is the most important turning point in Yugoslav history, as the cultural, military, and political issues of Yugoslavia will be resolved at this time.</p>
<p>The crisis began when some cabinet members refused to approve the League of Nations' resolution, resolving the Marseilles case, causing great anger to Foreign Minister Yevtich. According to some cabinet members, the League of Nations' resolution was not enough to compensate for the assassination of the Yugoslav monarch and did not guarantee the cessation of future terrorist acts. They questioned Foreign Minister Yevtich about the purpose of accepting this compromise. During the cabinet meeting on Monday, Foreign Minister Yevtich briefly outlined his views, and some cabinet members severely criticized him, making him feel embarrassed. His attempt to appease them only led to even more criticism. By the time the cabinet reconvened today, a stalemate had been reached, and the entire cabinet resigned. The resignation declaration was issued at 8 p.m. tonight, after a day of acrimonious debate. Army generals, who have been waiting for a long time, have now stepped forward, seeing that the government has finally given them an opportunity, and demanded to seize power in this time of national crisis. It remains doubtful whether the military is willing to accept the League of Nations' compromise plan. If they are unwilling, the turbulent situation in the Balkans is just beginning. (18th National Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Before submitting his resignation, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yevtich had a heated dispute with Prime Minister Uzunovic in the cabinet meeting. At the height of the dispute, Yevtich stormed out. Agricultural Minister Korosec, who agreed with Yevtich's attitude in the cabinet, also submitted his resignation. As a result, the cabinet crisis became unstoppable and had to submit a general resignation. It is understood that the dispute arose from internal problems. It is understood that Prime Minister Uzunovic has other political enemies in the cabinet besides Yevtich and Korosec. Therefore, Uzunovic is unlikely to be appointed to the new cabinet. Furthermore, the Regent has already summoned the leaders of the Croatian and Slovenian parties, which were previously dissolved, to negotiate the formation of a new cabinet. This is indeed a surprising move. According to sources from Yun Tong, the Regent intends to form a cabinet of national unity, with the current Chief of the Army, Zivkovic, as the Prime Minister. Zivkovic has already begun seeking the opinions of opposition party leaders. (18th National Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yevtich Ordered to Form a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: This morning, Prince Regent Paul continued to seek the opinions of various political parties in an attempt to resolve the cabinet crisis. It is generally believed that former Foreign Minister Yevtich was ordered to form a new cabinet after meeting with the Regent this morning. Some even said that the Regent gave Yevtich "unlimited delegation" to form a broad-based coalition cabinet, inviting leaders of some opposition parties who were banned after January 6, 1929 (when the late King Alexander I implemented a dictatorial system) to participate in the new cabinet. Judging from the Regent's meetings with the leaders of these parties yesterday and this morning, there is generally a reason for this. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Great Construction</h3>
<p>Reclaims Marshland into Province</p>
<p>Arduous Work Still Requires Ten Years to Complete</p>
<p>Emperors and Popes of Past Dynasties Failed to Achieve</p>
<p>Rome: Italy now has a new province called Littoria, which was originally marshland. People began to dredge it in 312 BC. After repeated efforts by emperors and popes of past dynasties, it was never completed. This marshland often emitted poisonous gases, posing a hazard to travelers. Italian Premier Mussolini decided to complete what his predecessors had failed to achieve through his efforts. However, the work has been going on for a long time, and the canal project has not yet been completed. Today, the Italian Premier held a ceremony to establish the new province, saying that this work will require another ten years to be completed. In order to maintain this great work and prevent it from being interrupted, Italy must have a larger military force. Those who heard this applauded continuously. The Italian Premier's speech was broadcast throughout the country, and anyone with a radio at home could hear it. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>On the French-Russian Military Alliance Heng</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a London dispatch stated: The French-Russian military agreement was formally established on the 22nd of last month. Its main points are (1)</p>
<p>that the two countries will cooperate in military technology and manufacturing, and (2) that they will plan for joint</p>
<p>response with Germany and Japan as hypothetical enemies. Recalling a Paris dispatch on the 24th of last month, Radical Socialist Party member Ah Xiangbo claimed that a defensive alliance had been established between France and Russia. In the event of any trouble between Germany and France, Soviet Russia would definitely support France. For a time, the international atmosphere was extremely turbulent. The French government</p>
<p>immediately denied this. The inside story was really unknown at the time. It was unexpected that after a month, the British newspaper spoke with certainty, indicating that most people already believed that there must be considerable truth to it. Now the French again have an indication of denial. However, we, from the facts to ponder, then it seems that France really has the possibility of concluding such an alliance with Russia. (1) Because France has a historical fear of Germany. Therefore, no matter how superior its own military preparedness is, or how numerous its sympathizers are, it always feels that its own security is still not complete. Since the French lack confidence in their own strength psychologically, they naturally consider it wise to form alliances with powerful countries. (2) Since the French and Russians initiated the Eastern European Pact, Poland has never expressed support because it does not want Russian troops to pass through. Germany wants to exchange for military equality and is unwilling to accept unconditionally. Britain is only guiding all parties from the sidelines and does not take any responsibility for whether it succeeds or not. Therefore, the Eastern European Pact has been brewing for more than half a year, but has not achieved anything. Given this situation, it is impossible to promote the realization of the Eastern European Pact without further action by France and Russia. (3) The cooperation between France and Italy has been actively progressing recently, but there are many difficulties between the two sides. It is still uncertain whether they will be able to reach a completely harmonious state. (4) If the French-Russian military agreement is successful, even if the Eastern European Pact cannot be realized, it will in fact have the effect of the pact to a certain extent. Looking at the content of this military agreement, it only emphasizes the exchange of military personnel and the mutual supply of munitions, and does not mention that Soviet Russia will send troops to jointly attack Germany. This point seems to be a step for France to plan to contact Poland, because in this way, Poland can avoid the danger of Russian troops passing through. Therefore, after this agreement is concluded, Poland may be able to change its attitude towards France. With these</p>
<p>factors, it can be seen that the rumors of the conclusion of this agreement between France and Russia may not be accidental.</p>
<p>If this agreement is indeed concluded, its impact will certainly not be limited to Europe. According to Article 4 of the agreement, if Soviet Russia is attacked by Japan, France will immediately supply munitions to Russia, etc. From this, it can be seen that if something happens to Japan and Russia, France will inevitably be involved. Since France does not maintain neutrality but supplies munitions to Soviet Russia, Japan has sufficient reason to provoke conflicts in French Annam. In the past, foreign telegrams stated that France was afraid of offending</p>
<p>Japan, so it was unwilling to conclude an agreement with Russia that would involve the Far East war. The meaning of France's continued denial of the French-Russian military alliance may lie in this.</p>
<h3>US Senate Opposes the Opening of the Nicaragua Canal</h3>
<p>Because it benefits coastal states and harms inland states</p>
<p>Senator Clark, a member of the Senate Interoceanic Canal Committee, expressed his opposition to opening the Nicaragua Canal today. Clark declared that this plan would greatly help the development of US coastal states and harm inland states. It is reported that the proposal to open the Nicaragua Canal was advocated by Mr. Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee this week, who said that it would be submitted to Congress. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Privy Council Meeting</h3>
<p>Decision to Abandon the Naval Treaty</p>
<p>Breaking the Balance of Power in the Pacific</p>
<p>Ambition to Dominate the Far East is Clearly Exposed</p>
<p>The US is Temporarily Unwilling to Express its Opinion</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the Privy Council held a full meeting in the presence of the Emperor and unanimously supported the Japanese government's decision to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty. It is reported that the formal note of abolition of the treaty will be sent to the US State Department after the Christmas holiday. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The advisory proposal to abolish the Washington Treaty was passed by the Privy Council today. Therefore, the government immediately requested the issuance of the proposal and attached it to tomorrow's cabinet meeting. After the decision, Prime Minister Okada immediately requested approval. On the morning of the 22nd, Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed Ambassador Saito in the United States, instructing him to notify the US government. Therefore, Ambassador Saito will observe the situation and then personally deliver the notice to the US government. If it can proceed smoothly, it can be implemented on the 22nd. At the latest, all procedures can be completed on the 27th after Christmas. (Telecommunications, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government will send the notice of abolition of the Washington Treaty to Ambassador Saito in the United States, and also intends to briefly explain the main purpose of the abolition. However, it is necessary to observe the changes after the adjournment of the London talks before changing the plan. However, it is decided to explain the reasons for the abolition notice to the public. The original text has been discussed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy, and the text is more than 1,200 words long. (Telecommunications, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials are unwilling to comment on the Japanese Privy Council's formal approval of the abolition of the 1923 Washington Naval Treaty. It is understood that no statement will be issued until a formal notice of abolition is received through diplomatic channels here. However, spokespersons close to the government unofficially declared that Japan's actions would be regarded as disrupting the political and naval treaty system that maintains security in the Pacific. The abolition of the treaty can also be regarded as the prelude to the arms race among the countries concerned in the Pacific. According to the opinions of observers here, if Japan obtains naval equality with Britain and the United States after abolishing the Washington Treaty, Japan will be sufficient to dominate the Far East. The power of most Westerners now will be eliminated, and the historical rights obtained by European and American countries in Asia, such as the open door policy of China, will also be harmed.

<h3>Naval Negotiations to Adjourn</h3>
<p>Japan's Last Efforts</p>
<p>Requesting a Provision for the Date of Reopening</p>
<p>(London) Although the US representative has received instructions from Washington to temporarily suspend the tripartite naval talks according to the British plan, the Japanese representative is still making final efforts to decide on the date of resumption of discussions. According to the British plan, the procedures for this issue will be determined by Britain. US representative Davis told Japanese representative Matsudaira today that the US attitude has not changed, believing that Japan's abolition of the Washington Treaty has suspended the negotiations. A request to resume talks can only be made when new events are discussed. Matsudaira replied that Japan insists on inserting a specific date for the resumption of talks. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>The United States Changes its Neutrality Principles</h3>
<p>The Intention is to Subdue Japan</p>
<p>One Party is Sufficient to Strengthen the League of Nations</p>
<p>One Party Pleases Britain to Obtain Support</p>
<p>Not Contrary to Major Diplomatic Strategies</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department is preparing to submit a proposal to President Roosevelt, advocating a complete revision of the US neutrality principle and the establishment of a new principle. This matter was seen in yesterday's telegram. Secretary of State Hull confirmed it, but also said that the outside world's statement that the United States will abandon its traditional principle of freedom of the seas is "completely speculative." According to some sources, if other countries go to war in the future, the US President may announce that US ships that venture to sail in war zones, and US arms merchants who trade with warring countries, will be responsible for the dangers they may encounter, and the US government will no longer provide assistance. This policy can enable the United States to cooperate with the League of Nations on the one hand, and satisfy Britain and France on the other. If the League of Nations imposes a blockade on a certain country, it does not need to worry about the United States. As for Britain and France, they have always said that the United States' complete conservatism and neutrality is sufficient to hinder the efforts of the League of Nations. Now that the United States has changed its principles, the situation has changed. The Washington government's change of principles is related to the naval talks. Because Japan's demands on the navy are unyielding, the United States believes that if it wants to subdue Japan, it will not succeed without the assistance of Britain or Soviet Russia. The change of neutrality principles is to please Britain and make it support the United States. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) If the most powerful country in the world tries to evade responsibility and remains isolated, it will be impossible for the country and the world to avoid the most serious consequences. President Roosevelt recently advocated amending the neutrality principle, and what he told the American people is this. President Roosevelt is now preparing to make the United States have a consistent theory in resolving various international relations. The principles on which it is based are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The United States will remain neutral in armed conflicts.</p>
<p>(2) On the one hand, it will avoid forming alliances with foreign countries, and on the other hand, it will cooperate with a series of powers and international leagues, and within the limits permitted by the US Constitution, jointly seek to maintain peace.</p>
<p>(3) Prevent US arms manufacturers from obtaining excessive profits from war, so as to prohibit US manufacturers from colluding with foreign industries.</p>
<p>(4) When the United States encounters attacks from other countries, it must stand undefeated. From now on, prepare a national mobilization plan to enable the US Navy to build the largest fleet permitted by the Washington Treaty, build the most modern navy, and open the Nicaragua Canal to connect</p>
<p>the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and complement the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Since taking office, President Roosevelt has declared that he will not interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, but will strengthen good neighborliness with Latin American countries, and has restored US-Russian diplomatic relations, all of which have been successful. Although there are disputes over naval issues between the United States and Japan in the current London talks, the relations between the two countries are still satisfactory. Therefore, regarding the war debt issue, although President Roosevelt has always maintained the rights that the United States should have, he has still tried his best to avoid aggravating the disputes. The new diplomatic theory announced by Roosevelt this time is compatible with the major diplomatic principles of the United States in the past, such as Pan-Americanism, the Monroe Doctrine, and the Open Door Policy in China, and does not run counter to them. Not only that, but the US government and people have recently become more convinced that Anglo-American understanding is the main condition for world peace. If the principle of freedom of the seas is modified, it will inevitably make Anglo-American understanding closer. In addition, the State Department's plan to President Roosevelt to modify the neutrality principle stipulates that the President is allowed to issue orders to prohibit the export of munitions, prohibit loans to warring countries, and prohibit the passage of ships carrying goods and munitions to warring countries from berthing in US ports. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Charles Warren, who served as Attorney General in the government of the late President Wilson from</p>
<p>1914 to 1917, recently published an article in a diplomatic magazine on the issue of the new neutrality principle being considered by the State Department, and proposed a principle that in future wars, especially in naval wars between countries such as Britain and Japan, if the United States wants to maintain the principle of freedom of the seas, it will inevitably be dragged into the vortex. Therefore, he advocated that the US President has the right to abandon or maintain all rights concerning neutral countries. Whether these neutrality rights are violated and whether the violation can be used as a reason for declaring war, and submitting it to Congress for deliberation, should also be at the discretion of the President. Until after the outbreak of the war, only the President can enjoy the following rights:</p>
<p>(1) Monitor all radio stations in the country and prohibit foreign diplomats from sending coded messages. (2) Prohibit the sale of weapons to warring countries. (3) Prohibit warships of warring countries carrying weapons or gun emplacements from entering the country. (4) Order all ships of warring countries to leave the United States. (5) Prohibit US ships from supplying ships of warring countries. (6) Prohibit US citizens from subscribing to public bonds of warring countries. (7) Prohibit foreign representatives from recruiting their own nationals in the United States to form volunteer teams.</p>
<p>Duris, an advisor to Norman Davis, the chief US naval representative, expressed his approval of the above claims, saying that US policy must be brave and have considerable flexibility, so as to become a real force to maintain peace, and can take effect before the war starts. (Havas Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Russia and France Deny Military Alliance</h3>
<p>The Two Countries Only Reached a Diplomatic Understanding</p>
<p>What British Newspapers Published is Completely False</p>
<p>(London) After the London Evening Star published the content of the French-Russian military agreement and commercial agreement, the French Embassy in Britain issued a statement saying that this statement was completely unfounded and that no word in the Star report was credible. The Soviet Embassy here also said that this statement was completely false. Responsible parties in Paris also announced that this statement was unfounded. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, the French side stated that there was no other action between France and Russia except for reaching a diplomatic understanding, cooperating with each other on the proposed Eastern Locarno Pact, and not concluding bilateral agreements with third countries during the Eastern Locarno Pact negotiations. I don’t know where the Star got the news from. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers here do not believe the news of the secret French-Russian military alliance published by the British Star. According to the Catholic German newspaper, this kind of rumor should be taken seriously. The Berlin Daily News stated that the news of the secret French-Russian military alliance has been reported more than a dozen times, and each time it has been inaccurate. The newspapers gave great coverage to French Foreign Minister Laval's recent friendly speech in Congress, and especially pointed out what the French Foreign Minister said about inviting Germany to join the Eastern Locarno Pact. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Communists Use Female Sex to Corrupt US Military Discipline</h3>
<p>Warnings from US Army and Navy Intelligence Agencies</p>
<p>(Washington) Navy Intelligence Director Kilkman stated to the House National Socialist Movement Investigation Committee today that the traditional weakness of sailors lies in lust. Communists use women to corrupt military discipline and incite rebellion. He has not heard of the National Socialist Party taking similar measures to cause instability in the Navy, but there is a lot of evidence that the Communist Party has such activities. Literature and beautiful women are the main weapons used by the Communist Party to paralyze naval officers and soldiers, but so far the effect is very small. Army Intelligence Director Smith also told the committee that the Communist Party is actively disrupting the discipline of army and navy personnel, with the aim of causing civil war during World War II. Smith also said that in 1932, the Intelligence Agency discovered a Communist Party headquarters in a certain military garrison, and its propaganda organization was very strict, causing instability in the army and security forces. It is reported that the committee has collected a lot of evidence of the Communist Party's propaganda and direct action in the United States so far, but the activities of the National Socialist Party have so far been limited to major cities on the Atlantic coast. This investigation will take at least two more weeks to complete. At that time, the committee will publish a detailed investigation report and draft a bill to curb such activities of foreigners plotting in the United States. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Franco-German Rapprochement</h3>
<p>A Powerful Guarantee for European Peace</p>
<p>Laval's Recent Diplomatic Statements</p>
<p>Urging Germany to Join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact</p>
<p>French Chamber of Deputies Passes Special Military Expenditure of 800 Million Francs</p>
<p>Today, during the Senate's discussion of the foreign affairs budget, Foreign Minister Laval delivered an important declaration. He began by stating that the resolution of the Saar issue and the South Hungarian disputes by the League of Nations was of utmost importance. The calmness of both South Hungary and the proactive mediation of other countries to quell the unrest were both commendable. Regarding Franco-Italian relations, he stated that negotiations were underway, aiming to harmonize the opinions of both countries not only on matters of particular concern to them but also on general policies. Mr. Laval praised Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's spirit of conciliation, stating that the compromise that France and Italy intended to reach would absolutely not harm the interests of the Little Entente countries. The Foreign Minister then spoke of the negotiations for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, saying that France made this proposal only after reaching complete agreement with Soviet Russia. "The collaboration between France and Russia is being conducted openly, and its purpose is to benefit the public." Mr. Laval mentioned Germany, stating that France would never take any action that would make Germans suspect France of pursuing any policy that would trap Germany in isolation. "France will soon negotiate with Germany again, urging Germany to conduct negotiations with France and other countries on equal terms, and urging it to join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, with all the guarantees granted to other signatory countries also being available to Germany." Mr. Laval concluded by saying, "The rapprochement between France and Germany within the international arena is indeed an effective guarantee of peace." (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Mr. Laval also disclosed the full text of the Franco-Russian draft of the treaty promoting the Eastern European Locarno Pact. Before Mr. Laval spoke, Navy Minister Pietri stated in the Senate that naval construction must be accelerated and insisted that the naval construction budget for 1935 must be 1.2 billion francs, compared to 900 million francs in 1934. Mr. Pietri also said that France had always regarded the Washington Naval Treaty as a "temporary necessity," so France refused to jointly abolish the treaty with Japan to avoid offending Britain and disrupting peace in Europe. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Chamber of Deputies passed a supplementary budget of 800 million francs with a vote of 460 to 130 to fund the bill to reform France's war supplies. The Socialist Party had proposed an amendment advocating that armaments be manufactured by the state and that the arms trade be controlled by the state starting from January 1st next year. Prime Minister Flandin treated this amendment as a matter of confidence, and the Chamber of Deputies ultimately struck down the Socialist Party's amendment with a vote of 388 to 199. The Radical Socialist Party requested that the issue be debated in January next year, which the government accepted. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Army Ministry's budget proposal, the special national defense expenditure of 800 million francs is allocated as follows: (1) Artillery and other military equipment: 615,500,000 francs; (2) Engineering Corps: 48,000,000 francs; (3) Military Supplies: 35,000,000 francs; (4) Health Affairs: 15,000,000 francs; (5) Ammunition: 80,000,000 francs; (6) Railways: 6,500,000 francs.</p>
<p>When the proposal was discussed by the Chamber of Deputies this morning, Prime Minister Flandin spoke repeatedly, explaining the needs of national defense. As a result, the proposal was passed with a vote of 460 to 130. Besides the orthodox socialists voting against it as usual, the communists on the far left actually voted in favor, which is an unprecedented situation in the history of world parliaments and is worthy of attention. During the discussion in the morning, former Aviation Minister Cot demanded that the arms manufacturing industry be nationalized, saying, "We are sincerely willing to serve on the battlefield, but on one condition, that we know that war is not a source of wealth for a few." Prime Minister Flandin replied that he very much wished for the nationalization of arms manufacturing, but France's experience in the European War was enough to prove that if France had relied solely on its own arsenals during the European War, it would have long lacked defensive weapons and been defeated by the enemy. France demanded that countries that love peace establish an international convention on the sale of arms and supervise it. "As for France, it has already strived to reduce its armaments to the lowest limit. If it is still unavoidable to strive to plan national defense anew, then the blame does not lie with France. There is now a great power that is increasing the number of arms manufacturing plants, with monthly manufacturing expenses between 350 million and 600 million francs. Is this something we can do? In short, for the sake of France's security, we must first seek it from ourselves and then seek it from others." When the discussion continued in the afternoon, the newly elected Socialist Party member Berane expressed his views, acknowledging the danger of Germany's rearmament. He said that the new Socialist Party would vote in favor of the special national defense expenditure bill and would use this bill as a reason to oppose increasing the term of military service (referring to increasing the term of military service from eighteen months to two years). Army Minister General Maurin rose to speak, requesting the Chamber of Deputies to pass the special expenditure bill with a spirit of sacrifice, saying that France's military equipment had become obsolete and should be renewed. He also said, "France's border defenses cannot be like China's Great Wall, thousands of miles of continuous interconnection. There must be places where defenses are not set up, which must be plugged." General Maurin also promised to establish a team of technicians to engage in technical work on border defenses.

<h3>British Air Ministry Reorganizes Aviation Organization</h3>
<p>Separation of Civil and Military Use</p>
<p>( ) The Air Ministry has recently completed the reorganization of the civil aviation organization. There are two main points: (1) Complete separation of civil and military aviation; (2) Issues related to civil aviation will no longer be submitted to the Air High Commission for review. According to the report published by the Civil Aviation Supervision Committee established by the Air Ministry in July, all agencies related to civil aviation should be more independent of the government-administered air force agencies than they are now. (Havas Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Enters a State of Sleep</h3>
<p>Committee Work Still in Progress</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference has entered a state of sleep since the Presidium met once on November 20th, but its affiliated agencies are still continuing to work. This can be proved by the conference's National Defense Expenditure Committee. The committee has now completed drafting the convention on national defense expenditure and has prepared a report advocating that (1) signatory countries must have the obligation to mutually notify all expenditures related to national defense; (2) stipulating the methods of publicizing and supervising the national defense budget, with three times for publicizing and supervising: (A) when the budget is passed; (B) if there is an increase or decrease in expenditure, it will be carried out nine or fifteen months after the event; (C) after being reviewed by the domestic high-level agency (this refers to the payment order and final account being reviewed by the audit agency). Experts believe that if this kind of national defense expenditure convention can be implemented, then military expenditure can be publicized, and the number of troops and weapons will also be publicized accordingly. There will be a close link between the two. The report is planned to be submitted to the Disarmament Conference within January next year. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Someone Threatens Roosevelt Again</h3>

<h3>Mediation of the Chaco Dispute</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Fails Again</p>
<p>Paraguay Accepts the Suggestion</p>
<p>(Geneva) The recent efforts of the League of Nations to resolve the Chaco dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay have failed. Although Bolivia sent a document to the League of Nations on December 10th, unconditionally accepting the suggestion, Paraguay notified the League of Nations today that the suggestion was difficult to implement, so it proposed a new suggestion, saying that it could serve as the basis for continued negotiations. The League of Nations will consider it in the coming days. According to the suggestion put forward by the League of Nations, the two warring countries should convene a ceasefire conference in the capital of Argentina, with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and the United States acting as arbitrators in the conference. If a ceasefire cannot be announced within two months, then it should be appealed to the Permanent Court of The Hague. If the war is stopped, then a military commission should be organized by representatives of the United States and South American countries to assist in demarcating a demilitarized zone of one hundred kilometers wide.

<p>La Paz The Paraguayan army launched a large-scale offensive against the Bolivian defense line today with a force of 80,000 soldiers, intending to occupy Villa Montes, the gateway to the Chaco oil region. The Paraguayan army does not expect to obtain it easily, so it will open the most intense scene of the Chaco War in more than two years. At present, the sound of heavy artillery never ceases day and night, and it can be vaguely heard dozens of miles away. The Bolivian government has also issued a communique stating that the Paraguayan army has launched a general attack on the Bolivian front line on the Villa Montes Avenue. The most intense war is centered on the Fort Boquerón. The Bolivian communique stated that the Bolivian army has concentrated all its strength in the most dangerous location, which is extremely difficult to shake. If the Paraguayan army occupies Villa Montes, it can drive straight in and attack the Bolivian mainland. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>America's Attitude Towards the Situation in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Implementing the Movement of Fleets Between the Two Oceans</p>
<p>The London Naval Reduction Preparatory Conference is intermittent. Britain has repeatedly put forward trial plans, but they do not conform to the facts. The claims of Britain, the United States, and Japan differ, so it has been shelved. The United States has recently been busy with elections, busy with the "New Deal," and busy with domestic issues such as unemployment relief. It seems that it is not very active in the maritime situation in the Pacific 丨丨future naval competition丨丨 and has no specific claims. However, it knows that Japan's abolition of the naval treaty will be realized. Verbal reconciliation may not be effective, so it is also engaged in practical military work, wanting to support its claims with its actual strength.</p>
<p>The strength includes its natural various mineral deposits, the production capacity of the current industrial sectors, and all its means of transportation, including the sea, land, and air forces. It is not easy to review them one by one. Fundamentally speaking, the strength of the United States is of course the most powerful country in the world. However, since 1929, it has been hit by the economic panic, and the signboard of permanent prosperity is unreliable. Now, it may be said that its strength has been slightly depleted, and far-reaching ambitions may be difficult to achieve for a while. It is important to solve domestic problems first. However, we know that the United States has fully developed into a modern industrial country. Even its agriculture has progressed to mechanized management, so it cannot maintain the status quo by relying solely on the domestic market. Moreover, maintaining the status quo is not a fundamental solution. Then, it must work hard to develop overseas markets like Britain and find economic outlets from abroad. After the European War, the United States has already become a huge financial capital country, emphasizing financial investment overseas and de-emphasizing the consumption of goods. However, recently (since Germany stopped paying reparations in 1931), European countries have successively defaulted on debts, and so has South America. Britain may not pay the debts due at the end of this year, so foreign investment is not very reliable. Therefore, it cannot help but try to stabilize the sales market again to promote the vitality of the industry.</p>
<p>The countries along the Pacific coast are all excellent consumption markets. Whether it is cotton, steel, machinery, etc., they are all promising in the future. However, the relationship there is quite complicated, and the competition is also very fierce. Moreover, the United States does not have a special sphere of commercial influence in the Far East. In the current era of state-controlled economic development, competition is not very convenient. Militarily, even if there are the Philippines and Guam, the locations are too far apart. The Philippines will be independent in ten years, and Guam is a small place, so how can it have the ability to support it? Therefore, the United States must rely heavily on the navy to give it full ability to protect maritime navigation. The US Navy is indeed second only to Britain, and cruisers and submarines are also inferior to Japan. Only battleships can barely cope, and they are separated in the Americas, between the two oceans. Once an incident occurs, it is very troublesome to concentrate troops.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Panama Canal has been opened, and the connection between the two oceans can be done without much effort. This spring, the Pacific Fleet crossed the canal eastward, taking 48 hours. This time, more than 130 warships and 100,000 soldiers came westward, but it only took 41 hours and 40 minutes to cross the canal. Its speed and agility are truly increasingly improving. From now on, the Atlantic Fleet and the Pacific Fleet can be more easily integrated into a group, no longer subject to geographical restrictions, going east and west freely. In the future, it will combine the Atlantic and Pacific fleets together, this year on this side, next year on that side, constantly moving to train its own soldiers. At the same time, it also slightly injects into the nearby residents. The fleet's supplies and the expenses of the soldiers' families are also a large consumption.</p>
<p>Why does the US government not hesitate to spend more on the movement of warships, ordering the two-ocean fleets to sail once a year? This is the US Navy's recent response. Because of its auxiliary ships, there were those built well. Separating and stationing the two fleets will make it difficult to handle in the event of an incident. It will be very disadvantageous if it falls into a passive position. Therefore, it must break through this type of natural restriction, making full use of its military strength, so that its imaginary enemies have scruples, and at the same time, it also takes care of the Philippines and its overseas markets in the Far East, wanting its maritime routes to have full protection, and hinting at its strong strength. As for using this to subsidize the economic turnover of the garrison area, that is a relatively small matter. (November 25th in Washington)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Korean Ruffians Ordered to Withdraw from the War Zone</h3>
<p>Ruffians Engage in Selling Drugs and Gambling</p>
<p>Our Side's Requests Lead to Japanese Crackdown</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Japanese and Korean ruffians in the "war zone" usually specialize in selling drugs and setting up gambling dens. After our side repeatedly requested the Japanese side to crack down on them, the Japanese side recently ordered the ruffians to withdraw within a time limit. According to people from Tangshan, when the Japanese and Korean ruffians in the city received the order from the Japanese Military Police Department on the 14th, they immediately convened a general meeting to discuss measures and decided to comply with the order to withdraw. Therefore, in the past few days, the Japanese and Koreans have been preparing everything and auctioning off furniture to serve as travel expenses in order to leave. The number of Japanese and Korean residents on the streets of Tangshan should be reduced starting from New Year's Day next year. According to the Zunhua County Government's report to the relevant parties here this morning (18th), the illegal shops of the Japanese and Korean ruffians in the county were also notified by the Japanese military police yesterday to close immediately and pack up to return to Japan. Those who fail to comply within the time limit will be forcibly expelled. The Japanese and Korean ruffians in the county are also preparing to leave the area. The reporter specifically inquired with the relevant parties about the truth, and it was said that both China and Japan believe that it is necessary to crack down on the trouble caused by the Japanese and Korean ruffians in the "war zone." After repeated discussions, the Japanese side agreed to deal with them separately. The recent order for the Japanese and Korean ruffians in Tangshan, Zunhua, and other places to withdraw is the beginning of the implementation of the crackdown. If the crackdown on the Japanese and Korean ruffians in the counties in the war zone continues step by step, then the security in the "war zone" can be expected to gradually become consolidated, and the benefits to the friendly feelings between the people of China and Japan will also be not small.

A draft agreement was signed by the three parties and notarized by lawyer Lin Xinggui on the 12th of this month, and the formalities for the contract were completed. The moving began yesterday (14th), and the ticketed exhibition will begin after New Year's Day next year.

<p>Draft Agreement for Donation and Entrustment The original text of the draft agreement for donation and entrustment: Ferguson, an American citizen, currently residing in Beijing (hereinafter referred to as Party A, which refers to the donor to Party B, the recipient, and the entruster to Party C, the entrusted party), as one party.</p>
<p>Chen Yuguang, President of Capital Jinling University (hereinafter referred to as Party B, which includes the successors of the university), as the other party, and Qian Tong, Chairman of the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter referred to as Party C, which includes its successors under public law), as the third party.</p>
<p>Party A came to China in his early years and participated in the founding of Nanjing Huiwen College, which has now been expanded into Capital Jinling University. Afterwards, he continued to engage in education and cultural undertakings in China for more than 40 years. Because of his deep love for Chinese cultural relics, he successively invested in the collection of bronzes, jades, porcelain, pottery, inkstones, inks, calligraphy, paintings, steles, gold stones, and other rubbings, accumulating to more than 1,000 pieces. Now that he is old, based on his friendly feelings towards China, he intends to make public to China what he has obtained from China, and because he served Party B the earliest, he is willing to donate them to Party B for preservation. Moreover, because Party B is willing to accept the aforementioned donation, but because there is no building for storage, it is not easy to break, and it has not yet been received, and at the same time, Party C is willing to first accept the entrustment and allocate the Wenhua Hall for display for public exhibition. Once the buildings of Jinling University are completed, they will be transferred again. After submitting to the Ministry of Interior the instructions for the first two numbers, etc., based on the above-mentioned reasons, the three parties negotiated the draft agreement as follows. Article 1: Party A hereby donates the aforementioned bronzes, etc., the types and details of which are detailed in the list of items attached to this agreement, to Party B for permanent preservation, but does not assume any defects in the donated items, and hopes that Party B will bear the following burdens and conditions when receiving compensation: (1) To complete a strong building in the Chinese style within a considerable period of time to store and display the donated items. The cost of this building shall not be less than silver dollars 40,000; (2) The donated items shall be allowed to be exhibited to people outside the school on time, and shall not be transferred or disposed of without the approval of the antiquities preservation and supervision authority; (3) In the event that Party B is dissolved, the donated items shall belong to nearby academic organizations engaged in the same purpose. Party B hereby accepts Party A's donation in accordance with the burdens and conditions attached to the preceding paragraph. Article 2: Party C promises to Party A to allocate the Wenhua Hall as the place for displaying the items before Party B actually receives the donated items. After this draft agreement is submitted to the Ministry of Interior for approval, it will immediately go to Party A's residence to check and collect the entrusted items according to the attached list of items, without charging Party A for transportation and storage expenses or remuneration. Party C shall be responsible for the entrusted items, except for force majeure such as natural disasters, for good safekeeping. All income from admission tickets will be used for the needs of layout and routine safekeeping. Once Party B sends a letter informing that the buildings have been completed, Party C shall jointly with Party B negotiate the transfer deadline, submit it to the Ministry for approval, and then send personnel to properly install the items for transportation to Beijing. All expenses shall be borne by Party B. The transfer shall also be supervised by the Ministry to show solemnity. Article 3: The procedures for terminating the entrustment, transferring possession, etc., shall be negotiated separately by Parties B and C at that time. This draft agreement and the list of items are written in four copies. When Party C submits it to the Ministry of Interior for approval, the Ministry seal shall be affixed to the agreement and sent to Party C for distribution to the parties for signature. When the signature is completed, it shall become a formal contract and take effect. Of the above four formal agreements, one copy shall be submitted by Party C to the Ministry of Interior for record, and Parties B and C shall each hold one copy. The remaining copy shall be delivered to Party A for Party A to copy and keep for future reference by his heirs. The original shall be sent by Party A to the Embassy of the United States for record, so as to be trustworthy. Attached List of Items. December 12th, 23rd year of the Republic of China. Party A, Donor and Entruster, American citizen Ferguson, Party B, Recipient, President of Jinling University Chen Yuguang, Party C, Entrusted Party, Director of the Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior Qian Tong, Drafter of the Agreement, Lin Xinggui, a student of Party A.</p>
<p>Representative's Remarks According to the representative of Dr. Ferguson's remarks to the reporter, Dr. Ferguson has lived in China for 47 years, came to China in 1887, and founded Jinling University in Nanjing in 1888. Later, he served as the President of Nanyang University in Shanghai and as an advisor to the President's Office. Afterwards, he moved north to reside. The doctor highly respects Chinese culture and is interested in historical relics. For decades, he has spent money collecting them, totaling thousands of items. Recently, due to his advanced age, based on his enthusiasm for returning to China what he obtained from China, he decided to donate all the antiques to Jinling University for preservation and as a permanent memorial to the founding of the school. Currently, because the school does not have suitable buildings, they are temporarily displayed in the Antiquities Exhibition Hall. A draft agreement has been established by the three parties to ensure compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>Display Plan The Antiquities Exhibition Hall received an order from the Ministry of Interior to follow the instructions for the registration and display of Ferguson's antiquities. Yesterday (14th), people were sent to Ferguson's residence to move the items. According to Fu Yiwen, Section Chief of the Second Section of the Hall, "The Hall originally designated the Wenhua Hall as the exhibition room for Ferguson's antiquities, but the hall has not been completely cleaned up due to the short period of time. It must be cleaned up before the display can begin. However, it has been scheduled to open after New Year's Day next year. At that time, the ticket price will be determined after it is submitted to the Ministry." (15th)</p>

<h3>Following Finance Minister Kong's Solemn Denial of Rumors</h3>
<p>Market Turmoil Subsides</p>
<p>Gold Standard Bonds Return to Normal</p>
<p>High Foreign Exchange Rates Are a Common Year-End Phenomenon</p>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, recent rumors in Shanghai about the government implementing inflation led to extreme volatility in the trading market. After Finance Minister Kong solemnly declared these rumors untrue to Huadong News Agency reporters the night before last, yesterday, all trading gradually stabilized. The reporter has learned the following details about yesterday's situation:</p>
<h3>Recovery Process</h3>
<p>Following the sudden rise of rumors in recent days, various transactions experienced drastic fluctuations, causing widespread panic. This was especially true for gold standard bonds. After Huadong News Agency reporters learned from Finance Minister Kong that the rumors were untrue, yesterday, gold standard bonds and securities gradually stabilized. Yesterday, the central government's listed standard for rising gold standard bonds was 1005.80. The highest price in the gold market did not exceed 1000 yuan, and the lowest was only 993.7 yuan, a difference of only 5 yuan and 3 jiao. Market transactions favored a small number of small long positions, with fewer short positions. The government bond market was also relatively stable, with a difference of less than one yuan. Yarn, cloth, flour, and other commodities have also gradually returned to normal, with a difference of only two or three jiao for flowers and only seven or eight jiao for yarn and cloth. Although there were slight fluctuations in the afternoon, they were very few.</p>
<h3>Cause of the Rumors</h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency reporters, who have been investigating the cause of these rumors in the market, banking circles, industrial circles, and semi-official circles for several days, the rumors were deliberately spread by speculators. It was said that during the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, a certain committee member proposed implementing inflation. Fortunately, the timing was not ripe, and the proposal was not brought up. The rumor-mongers seized the opportunity to create rumors benefiting either long or short positions, causing widespread panic in the market and plunging the market into a precarious situation. According to financial giants, the United States is the world's gold superpower, and even their implementation of inflation has not been very effective. It is absolutely impossible for our country to do so at this time, and the government will definitely not implement it. There is no need for people in the market to worry needlessly and give outsiders a chance to manipulate the market, they said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate was 3 jiao and 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon, 5 fen higher than the day before. The "劃頭" rate was also higher, at 3 jiao and 8 fen. On the surface, it seems to be gradually tightening again, but in reality, this kind of situation is an extremely common phenomenon in the ten-odd days leading up to the Chinese New Year. According to people in the money industry, speaking to Huadong News Agency reporters, although money is slightly tighter this year than last year, it cannot be said to be unusually tight. During the two New Year festivals of the Zhilu War in 1924 and the founding of the National Government in Nanjing in 1927, the highest peak of 7 jiao per tael was once reached, they said.</p>
<h3>Salt Revenue Audit Office Repays</h3>
<p>Crisp Loan Principal</p>
<p>Totaling £96,049 British Pounds</p>
<p>According to a Guofa News Agency report from Shanghai on the 19th, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi announced today that the Director of the Salt Revenue Audit Office has remitted £96,049 to London for the repayment of the principal and interest of the 1928 term of the 1912 Crisp Loan. According to the 1929 Salt Revenue Debt Reorganization Plan, all overdue interest on the Crisp Loan was cleared in 1930, and the Anglo-French Loan of 1908 was also cleared in mid-October of this year. The overdue principal of the Crisp Loan can now be repaid. The payment made this time for the 1928 term is the initial step in clearing the arrears.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>No Definite Date to Assume Office in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Secretary-General Huang Huabiao to Depart First Yesterday</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, the newly appointed Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, took a train to Nanjing from Shanghai on the evening of the 9th to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and to request policy instructions from the central government. Having completed his public duties, he returned to Shanghai by train from Nanjing the day before yesterday. According to Huang's aides, speaking to Xin Xin News Agency reporters yesterday, Huang has appointed the newly appointed Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Huabiao, to handle the takeover matters of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, departing for Hangzhou on the 19th. As of yesterday, the date of Huang's own departure to Zhejiang to take office had not been decided, but it is expected to be within the next few days, they said.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company General Manager Liu Hongsheng Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>"Haiheng" Imported from Qingdao Yesterday</p>
<p>"Haizhen" Expected to Arrive on the 26th</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haiheng" ship, which recently made its maiden voyage to Haizhou and Qingdao, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and is scheduled to sail to Shantou, Guangzhou, and other ports at noon on the 21st. The "Haili" ship is currently being painted and will be received soon, with a maiden voyage scheduled. The "Haizhen" ship, currently sailing to China, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>"Haiheng" Returns to Shanghai The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haiheng" ship, which was shipped to Shanghai at the end of last month and officially received, sailed to Haizhou and Qingdao the day before yesterday for its maiden voyage. General Manager Liu Hongsheng, Business Section Chief He Molin, and others from the company traveled with the ship, inviting local gentry and merchants to visit the new ship and taking the opportunity to inspect the newly completed Lianyungang Port in Haizhou. They completed their tasks the day before yesterday and returned south. The ship entered the Songkou port at about 8:00 yesterday morning and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 9:30, carrying a large amount of intermodal cargo from both locations.</p>
<p>He's Remarks According to Section Chief He, who returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, the "Haiheng" ship made a very good impression on the local people in Haizhou and Qingdao. The newly completed Lianyungang Port is currently only large enough to berth one ship. However, with the implementation of water-land intermodal transport in the area, the cargo volume is very high, so the dock is still insufficient. The staff of the local bureau are working day and night and are very busy. He also said that the company's new ships are entirely for use on the South China shipping routes. "Haili" is being painted As for the "Haili" ship, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, it is currently being painted by the Jiangnan Shipyard. It will be completed and received soon, with a scheduled departure. The "Haizhen" ship, which is currently en route, is expected to arrive around the 26th of this month, according to the Shanghai representative office of the British shipbuilding company, Malcolm &amp; Co. At that time, all four sister ships ordered and built in England will be completely taken over by the company and will operate between the two major ports of Shanghai and Guangzhou, they said.</p>
<h3>Dr. Gao De Summoned to Ningbo Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Treat Chairman Chiang's Dental Ailment</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission passed through Shanghai last Saturday and returned to his ancestral home in Fenghua for a short rest and to pay respects at his late mother's grave. According to Finance Minister Kong, speaking to reporters yesterday, Chairman Chiang's dental ailment has not yet healed after the extraction. He has now telegraphed for dentist Gao De to go to Fenghua for treatment. Mr. Gao set off this morning (i.e., yesterday). Chairman Chiang will stay in Fenghua for a few days and then return to Nanjing, he said.</p>

<h3>International Trade Bureau</h3>
<p>Convenes Exporters' Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>To Coordinate the Promotion of Trade in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of the global economic panic, the continuous decline of export trade, and the increasing trade deficit, convened a meeting of Southeast Asian export traders at the bureau's conference room at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to seek opinions in order to find a way to save foreign trade. Those in attendance included Guo Zhenjia (Da Xing Hang), Xie Yian (Nanqiao Hang), Zhao Guide, Qian Zhongfu (Zha Hua Company), Kong Zuan (Jun Chang Hua Hang), Zhao Zibin, Zheng Houdong (Jinhai Trading Company), Wu Hankang (Baolai Hang), Chen Zizhang, Shi Defang (Yihua), Shi Yulin (Cheng Chang Silk Store), and Liu Shimu, who is familiar with Southeast Asian market conditions, totaling more than a dozen people.

The topics discussed at the time included freight, export tariffs, export bills of exchange, bank export standards, and commercial ethics. Experts Liu Shimu and Qian Zhongfu contributed their opinions.

<h3>China Factory Federation</h3>
<p>Planning to Hold a Shanghai South National Exhibition</p>
<p>Filed with the City Party Department and Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Federation, in order to complete the national product promotion for the Women's National Products Year and in accordance with the provisions of its charter, has launched the Shanghai South District National Products Exhibition to give the residents of the Shanghai South District a deep impression and to seek effective promotion of national products.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan</h3>
<p>The Twenty-First Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Zhilan and Three Others</p>
<p>Returned Home Aboard the "Shanghai Maru"</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Japan have been unreasonably expelled by the Japanese authorities. More than two hundred people have returned to China one after another. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, another twenty-first group of expelled overseas Chinese, including Chen Zhilan, Xu Baohan, Guo Zuoqing, and Ye Hongmin, arrived in Shanghai aboard the "Shanghai Maru." After landing, they stayed at the Lao Gongxin Inn in the Nanshi district. Hearing the news, reporters from the Shiye News Agency immediately went to inquire. According to Xu Baohan, "Chen Zhilan and I were in business in Kobe. Guo Zuoqing and Ye Hongmin were working in Nagoya. We were all law-abiding and did not break the law. Unexpectedly, we were expelled by the Japanese authorities and forced to return home, which is extremely hateful. When we were escorted onto the ship, the Chinese Consulate made representations, but the Japanese authorities turned a deaf ear and acted arbitrarily," he said.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Japanese Training Fleet</h3>
<p>And Three Princes Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Fleet Docked at the Huishan Wharf Yesterday Afternoon. Japanese Residents Held a Grand Welcome.</p>

<p>Arriving in Shanghai Yesterday Rear Admiral Nakamura, Commander of the Japanese Training Fleet, led 300 naval academy graduates aboard the "Asama" and "Yakumo" ships from Sasebo at the beginning of the month to conduct practical training at sea. After arriving in Qingdao, they stayed for several months, visited scenic spots, and paid visits to Mayor Shen and naval authorities of various countries. They left Qingdao for Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. on the 17th and arrived at the port at around 12:00 p.m. yesterday, docking at the Huishan Wharf.

<p>The Princes on Duty On this visit to Shanghai by the two ships, three princes are on duty in the navy: Prince Asaka Yasuhiko, a gunnery officer on the "Yakumo" ship, and Prince Fushimi Hiroyoshi, an ensign candidate on the "Asama" ship.

<h3>All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Requests Tax-Exempt Passports for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Meeting Yesterday Decides to Purchase Grain for Distribution</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Drought Relief Association of the Jiaxu Year (1934) held a standing committee meeting yesterday. Those present included Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Shenzhi, Wang Rutang (representing Wu Tianfang), Qian Junren, Xu Xinliu, Chu Huiseng, Hu Fengxiang, Zhuang Yuqing, Yu Zhongxian, Xu Jilun, Lu Zhinan, Xu Qianlin, Fan Zhenchu, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Weiru, Zhou Shouliang, He Dekui, Wang Yiting, and more than twenty others. Chu Huiseng presided over the meeting. Reports were made on telegrams from various places requesting relief. The following were then discussed: (1) Qian Junren, the director of the relief in the third district, reported on the situation in Shangyu, Xinchang, and Shengxian counties. The disaster situation in the Kunlian districts of the three counties is very serious, but due to the county boundaries, they are not within the scope of the investigation and relief. It was decided to allocate 2,000 yuan each to Lihai in Shaoxing and Liangnong in Yuyao, and to ask Director Qian to separately solicit donations from charity groups and fellow villagers, to be combined for relief. (2) A motion to add Ju Nianqu as a standing committee member of the association was passed. (3) The Jiaxing County Government requested an additional allocation of relief grain. It was decided to reply by letter, stating that it would be discussed further when donations were sufficient. (4) A letter was sent to the Zhejiang Relief Association inquiring about which of the remaining three counties under its responsibility for relief would be given priority and requesting a prompt reply. It was decided to proceed accordingly. (5) The drought relief associations of various provinces allocated theater tickets as cash to the association. The association has registered the receipts. When selling the tickets, many were returned due to expiration. It was decided that those returned before the expiration date would be compensated by the members of the association, and those returned after the expiration date could not be accepted. The ticket sellers were asked to forgive the payment. (6) It was resolved to transfer Wukang, Deqing, and Yuhang to the drought relief associations of various provinces for investigation and relief.</p>
<p>The association believes that Wenling, Huangyan, and Pingyang in Zhejiang have had abundant rice harvests this year. Therefore, it plans to send personnel to purchase 40,000 dan of rice and 20,000 bags of flour in the near future, specifically for the victims in Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and Fengde counties. It also plans to purchase 100,000 dan of foreign rice from Siam and Saigon. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the National Government Relief Committee requesting the issuance of passports, stating: "To whom it may concern, the drought in Zhejiang Province this year is widespread and affects a large population, requiring a huge amount of relief grain. The rice produced in Zhejiang Province has always relied on commercial transportation from other provinces such as Xichang, Xiang, and Gan to make up for the shortfall. Now, all regions have been hit by drought, and the sources have been exhausted. The prospect of people's food is a matter of great concern. After repeated discussions, this association has decided to send personnel to purchase 100,000 dan of relief grain from Siam, Saigon, and other places, to be shipped to Shanghai in batches and then transported to the counties most severely affected by the disaster in the interior, for winter and spring relief. However, in order to save relief funds, we earnestly request that you forward this to the Ministry of Finance to check the regulations on tax exemption for disaster relief items, and approve the Jianghai Customs to exempt the import tax on this relief grain, in order to benefit the poor and heavy the government with disaster relief. We have prepared two copies of the application form for tax-exempt passports, a total of ten sheets, and respectfully send them to your committee for review and forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for issuance of tax-exempt passports for the procurement of large quantities of relief rice. We earnestly request your review and approval for implementation, which is a truly kind act."</p>
<h3>Reply from the Jiangxi Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Welcoming the Red Swastika Society Relief Team</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society relief team departed for the disaster area in Jiangxi by the Jiangxin ship some days ago to carry out relief work, as previously reported. It is now reported that Chairman Xiong Shihui of the Jiangxi Provincial Government sent a telegram to the society to welcome the relief team. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the Jiangxi Relief Supervision Committee of the Red Swastika Society, I have received and read the telegram with respect. I deeply appreciate your society's presidents Zhou and Han leading a team to Jiangxi to provide relief and benefit the disaster victims. I have instructed the Relief Affairs Committee to receive them properly. I am sending this telegram in reply. Please note, Xiong Shihui."</p>
<p>It is also reported that the society believes that epidemics are prevalent in the Jiangxi disaster area, and that it is not sufficient to provide relief without hiring more doctors. Therefore, Mr. Zhou Zongliang, a supervisor of the society, sent letters to invite five doctors, Wen Chi, Wei Zuxian, Tang Xianzhou, Li Yongbin, and Zhao Renjun, as well as assistants Fang Fang, Zhuge Qiwen, Fang Qizhong, and Wang Bihua, to accompany the team to the disaster area for relief.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Use of Domestic Fir Timber</h3>
<p>Telegraph from the Fir Timber Industry Association of the Upper Min River: "To the Executive Committee of the Central Party Department in Nanjing, Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, National Government Chairman Lin, Executive Yuan President Wang, Finance Minister Kong, and Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner Chen, We humbly report that Fujian Province has always been a major producer of fir timber, which is not only related to the livelihood of the entire province but also a source of national wealth. Five years ago, the annual output reached more than 40,000, with a value of more than 10 million. In recent years, the Communist bandits have been wreaking havoc in northern Fujian, coupled with the apportionment of military supplies and the imposition of exorbitant taxes, and local ruffians extorting money, the costs along the way exceed more than twice the cost. As a result, the timber industry has suffered a disastrous defeat, and timber workers have gone bankrupt. The annual output has decreased year by year, to less than 10,000. More than 20 counties in the upper reaches of the Min River, and millions of workers, all depend on the timber industry for their livelihood. Now, they are facing starvation, and they are bound to take risks. The main reason is the illegal collection of fees. It is understood that the 19th Route Army in Fujian, in order to provide sufficient supplies for the Liu and Lu units, created a temporary defense subsidy fee at Shuikou, collecting 45 yuan per large timber raft. The original plan was to abolish it after six months, but it has been two years now and there is still no clear order for exemption. In addition, He Gonggan, the former Director of Finance of the pseudo-People's Government, established a bureau in Zhuqi and collected a timber raft business tax on the way, which is no different from a transit tax, levying it at more than 60 per thousand. This practice is still followed today, coupled with the extortion of local ruffians everywhere, causing great pain and suffering. Timber workers have repeatedly complained to the association, with tears in their eyes. Although the organizing office of this association has repeatedly sent telegrams to the Nanchang headquarters, appealing to order the Fujian Provincial Government to abolish the temporary defense subsidy fee and rectify the timber raft business tax, we have been informed that the Fujian Provincial Government has been instructed to investigate and handle the matter. At the same time, we have appealed to the Fujian Provincial Government, presenting the same situation, and strictly prohibiting the extortion of local ruffians along the way, all of which have been filed for several months, but have not been implemented. If this continues, the future of the timber industry will be ruined. Considering that the government's policy is to first alleviate the suffering of the people, and that the central government has issued a clear order to exempt exorbitant taxes, and the provinces have successively implemented it, Fujian Province, which has suffered from the Red disaster for a long time, should be given extra care and treated equally. We dare to telegraphically appeal for your sympathy, to reduce the burden of merchants, and request that you submit this to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and immediately order the Fujian Provincial Government to abolish the temporary defense subsidy fee at Shuikou, rectify the timber raft business tax, and order the garrison along the way to strictly protect the timber industry, and issue a ban on illegal collection along the way, in order to relieve the suffering and maintain the timber industry. In addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to petition, we respectfully submit this to you. We are filled with apprehension and await your orders. The Fir Timber Industry Association of the Upper Min River kowtows."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce's</h3>
<p>Method for Exchanging Old Stamps</p>
<p>To Wait for Each Provincial Bureau to Submit and Verify the Total Number Before Devising a Proper Plan</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Your telegram has been received and acknowledged. The stamp tax revenue has been stipulated to be used for offsetting the abolition of land tax surcharges and exorbitant taxes in each province, city, and county, in accordance with the resolutions of the National Finance Conference, which is of utmost importance to alleviate the suffering of the people. Therefore, the exchange of old stamps for new stamps must be based on the principle of not causing a major impact on future tax revenue. After the chambers of commerce in each province and city complete the registration, how should they be exchanged in stages will depend on the number of registrations in each province and city. Since it is impossible to predict in advance, the method of exchange must be determined separately after the stamp and alcohol tax bureaus in each province submit the total number of registrations for review by the ministry. Previously, the Taicang County Chamber of Commerce directly telegraphed the ministry, and a reply was sent informing them to proceed with registration within the prescribed time limit and not to harbor doubts and wait and see. It is commendable that the chamber of commerce has been actively handling the registration matters. After completion, they should promptly compile a list together with the original application and send it to the Jiangsu Stamp and Alcohol Tax Bureau for verification and forwarding. This is the approval."</p>

<h3>Norwegian Consul Talks</h3>
<p>Investigation into the Harvard Incident</p>
<p>Yesterday, Only Over a Hundred Bags of Sunken Rice Were Salvaged</p>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, after the Tung Tak steamer, represented by the Ta Fa Shipping Company, collided with the Norwegian Harvard steamer, represented by the Mei Shun Company, both parties are currently investigating the matter of responsibility, while the insurance companies are carrying out salvage work. The news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Tak Enters Dock The Tung Tak steamer, yesterday morning at ten o'clock, was towed from the 43rd pontoon in Pudong into the old dock of the Yih Sung Shipbuilding Plant in Pudong, opposite Dongjiadu, and the accumulated water was drained in the afternoon. It is scheduled for nine o'clock this morning to invite the Shanghai Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the China United Marine Insurance Company, to jointly send marine surveyors to inspect the vessel at the old British dock in Pudong.</p>
<p>Continued Salvage of Sunken Rice The Harvard steamer was loaded with over ten thousand bags of Siamese rice. Apart from the four hundred-odd bags salvaged the day before yesterday, yesterday, the three insurance companies, Yangtze, Jardine, and New Zealand, hired laborers, wearing rubber suits, to continue diving and salvaging. However, because many of the rice bags were broken due to the expansion of the rice grains, and they were difficult to carry out, only over a hundred bags were salvaged yesterday. There are still ten thousand bags of rice in the ship. If salvage work is not stepped up, there is no hope for the Harvard steamer to resurface.</p>
<p>Consul's Talk Yesterday, according to Mr. Gilder, Vice Consul of the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai, who was interviewed by a reporter from the Kwok Man News Agency, this Consulate summoned the parties involved to the Consulate at three o'clock in the afternoon yesterday (the 18th) and held a hearing. In Norwegian legal terminology, its nature can be translated as a maritime investigation tribunal. Apart from the ship owner, pilot, chief mate, second mate, and chief engineer of the Harvard steamer, who were all present at the hearing, the personnel of the Tung Tak steamer did not comply with the summons and were not present. At the hearing, the speaker served as the presiding judge, and the two ship owners, Nuvan and Persson, served as jurors. The purpose of this investigation is to make a detailed and factual legal record of the details of the incident, for use as a basis for future negotiations, arbitration, or compensation. As for how to arbitrate in the future, this Consulate has neither received any request from any party nor has any preconceived notions as to who is responsible. As for the purpose of holding this investigation tribunal yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday), it was to submit the hearing records to the Norwegian government.</p>
<p>Customs Notice Mr. Guthe, Acting Harbour Master of the Jianghai Customs, issued a notice yesterday stating that the Norwegian Harvard steamer is currently sunk near Lujiazui in Section 4 of this port, its position is about two hundred feet downstream from the Lujiazui port police stationed ship, and the stern extends into the navigable waterway for about two hundred feet. The masts, chimneys, and upper parts of the ship can be seen regardless of the tide. All navigating vessels should navigate on the Puxi side of the sunken ship and should reduce their speed so that they can stop at any time. Furthermore, salvage operations are currently underway. All vessels should also pay attention to the fact that the sunken ship's signal will be hung on the foremast and stern flagpoles. During the day, it will be a green flag, and at night, it will be one green light and one white light, strung vertically. All shipping merchants are hereby notified. Acting Harbour Master Guthe.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Compensation for the Deceased Crew of the Mount Tai Steamer Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>Senior Employees Receive One Year's Salary According to Maritime Law</p>
<p>Lower-Level Crew Members Receive a One-Time Compensation of Five Hundred Yuan Each</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Mount Tai steamer of the Hua Merchants San Pei Steamboat Company, which sailed from Qingdao to Shanghai on the 26th of last month, had an accident en route. The families of all the deceased crew members repeatedly requested the company to resolve the aftermath. In addition to the unpaid wages, which had accumulated to more than three months for all crew members, which the company's manager, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, paid in advance, the compensation funds were delayed for more than ten days and had not been resolved. Yesterday, representatives from the Chinese Marine Engineers Association and various groups in this port personally negotiated with Mr. Yu, the manager of the company. It was agreed on the spot that the chief engineers and first and second assistant engineers of the engine department would each receive one year's salary in accordance with the provisions of maritime law. As for the lower-level crew members, because their full-year salary was not much, they would each receive five hundred yuan. The families all accepted. In addition, there was the issue of cultivating the crew members' children. Manager Yu also agreed to find suitable schools on their behalf and bear the costs, so that they could find employment and resolve their livelihood, in order to comfort the deceased.</p>
<h3>Memorial for Mr. Yao Zirang's Passing</h3>
<p>People from All Walks of Life Initiate a Public Memorial Service</p>
<p>Two O'Clock in the Afternoon on the 26th</p>
<p>Since Mr. Yao Zirang passed away last winter, people from all walks of life have deeply mourned him. The 26th of this month is the anniversary of Mr. Yao's death. Therefore, elders and celebrities such as Tang Wenzhi, Wang Qingmu, Wang Zhen, Liu Yazi, Huang Qinglan, Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Taoyi, Shen Weixian, Qin Xitian, Huang Yanpei, and Shen Enfu have initiated a public memorial service at the Guandi Temple inside the West Gate of Shanghai at two o'clock in the afternoon on that day. All memorial items will be collected by the temple on their behalf. Those who wish to participate in the memorial service can go there at that time.</p>
<h3>A Plea for Relief</h3>
<p>The Ren Ji Road Sino-Foreign Relief Association received reports from various drought-stricken counties in Jiangsu Province yesterday, recorded as follows: (1) A letter from Father Chen of the Catholic Church in Lishui County states that Lishui County is surrounded by Huangshan mountains, which stretch across the entire county. The residents cultivate the land at the foot of the mountains, and the land is barren, resulting in very poor harvests. This summer, there was a three-month drought, with no rain at all. The fields cracked. Initially, the farmers pawned their belongings and hired laborers to irrigate the land, but then the ponds and reservoirs dried up, and they had to watch the crops wither. The autumn harvest was only one-tenth or one-twentieth of normal. There was no harvest to speak of. It is not uncommon to see parents carrying their children into the city seeking food. There are also those who cultivate over a hundred acres of land but have no grain to cook and are waiting to die. In short, the entire Lishui County, except for a few embanked fields in the Shijiu Lake area in the south, which yielded seventy to eighty percent of the normal harvest, is in extreme distress. Now that it is deep winter, there is no rice to eat and no clothes to keep warm. The various tragic scenes are unbearable to witness. If relief is not provided urgently, the number of poor people who will die of starvation, freeze to death, or become displaced will be countless. (2) A letter from Father Li of the Catholic Church in Jurong County states that Jurong is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the area is vast and the terrain is very high. The harvests have been poor for many years, and the people have long been unable to make a living. This summer, the drought was devastating, lasting for three months. The high and low-lying fields were dry and cracked, and there was no autumn harvest. Even the by-products were poor. People's livelihoods were on the verge of collapse. As a result, there was eating from door to door, fleeing from famine, robbery, begging, and selling daughters. Such tragic and cruel acts are unprecedented in decades. Currently, farmers are filling their stomachs with Guanyin powder, chaff powder, and sweet potatoes. In addition, it is winter, and the weather is cold with no clothes to keep warm. If no measures are taken to provide relief, they will inevitably die in ditches. Please send personnel to investigate and provide relief. (3) A letter from the Drought Relief Committee of Jintan County states that our county is a poor area in Jiangsu Province. Even in years of good harvest, the people can hardly make ends meet. This summer, the rainfall was exhausted, and the farmland was turned into red soil. The farmers have no surplus savings and no seeds to harvest, so they eat grass roots and sell their children to barely survive. The severity of the disaster is the worst among the disaster-stricken counties in Jiangsu Province. Now that it is deep winter, there are no fewer than tens of thousands of people waiting to be fed. If relief is not provided in time, it will inevitably harm society and is of great concern. Therefore, we earnestly request the allocation of funds for relief. It is heard that the association is facing difficulties in raising funds due to the widespread drought and the difficulty in donations, and the cotton power is limited. It is hoped that all sectors will lend a helping hand to alleviate this crisis.</p>
<h3>Yong An Banking and Investment Company</h3>
<p>Inventory of Accounts Continued Suspension of Business</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Claims That Creditors Will Not Suffer Losses</p>
<p>No Hope of Resuming Business After This Storm</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Yong An Banking and Investment Company, after suspending business for seven days starting on the 12th of this month, the Board of Directors announced yesterday morning that they would conduct an inventory due to the general manager, Ou Jiancheng, absconding with funds, and that creditors would not suffer losses. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inventory of Accounts Lawyer Jiang Yiping and others, representing the Board of Directors, announced that according to the Board of Directors of the Yong An Banking and Investment Company, the company was originally scheduled to resume business as usual on the 19th of this month. However, due to the general manager's departure, all matters must be sorted out before they can be addressed. The company has now engaged Lawyers Shen, Jiang, Wu, and Luo, and Accountant Jiang, to quickly inventory the accounts. The company has not much debt and will definitely not cause any losses to creditors, no matter the outcome of the inventory. Once the inventory is completed, the company will announce and be responsible for handling the matter. This is a special request to publish a notice in the newspaper to inform all interested parties.</p>
<p>Continued Suspension of Business The company owes approximately 120,000 yuan in deposits, and people owe the company approximately 90,000 yuan in loans. In addition to inventorying the accounts, the Board of Directors has warned General Manager Ou Jiancheng to come forward and take responsibility, or they will investigate according to the law. They originally intended to resume business, but now, due to the uncleared accounts and the general manager's departure, they are continuing to suspend business. The lawyer's notice mentioned above is displayed at the entrances of the company's head office on North Sichuan Road and its branch office on Avenue Joffre. It is decided that after the accounts are cleared, the deposits will be returned to the depositors in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>The Supreme Court Will Summon Li Guojie for Trial Tomorrow</h3>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was accused last year of embezzlement and misappropriation of huge sums of money. He was sentenced to imprisonment by the court. Li refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, but still refused to accept the verdict. He then appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. During this period, Li was treated at the Shanghai Hospital at the San Tai Wharf in Nantao due to illness. For the sake of caution, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent two inspectors and two detectives, together with four policemen from the Fourth Squadron, to take turns to monitor him day and night. It has been over a year. It is now learned that the Supreme Court has scheduled a court hearing at the Shanghai Local Court at 1:00 PM tomorrow (the 21st). The court has already notified Shen Xiqing, the president of the Shanghai Local Court, yesterday, ordering him to summon Li Guojie, who resides in the Shanghai Hospital, to attend the trial.</p>
<h3>The Zhabei Charity Group's Congee Kitchen Will Open on Schedule</h3>
<p>Congee Will Be Distributed for Two Months Starting on the 25th of This Month</p>
<p>Due to the unusually severe drought this year, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the Zhabei Charity Group to hold a congee distribution event earlier in order to provide relief. Wang Binyan, the chairman of the charity group, has been requesting donations of funds and rice from all parties. They have received over one thousand yuan in relief funds. Du Yuesheng and Jin Tingsun each donated one hundred dan of rice. However, after the opening, approximately 10,000 people will receive congee each day, requiring 30 dan of rice per day. For two months, 2,000 dan will be required in order to be held, so as to avoid temporary difficulties. Therefore, Mr. Wang intends to request funds from various charity groups again. It has been decided that the opening will be held at the original site on Liuying Road on the 25th of this month. The congee distribution time will be from 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM every day. Each adult will receive three ladles, and each child will receive two ladles. It is decided that it will last for two months.</p>
<h3>Jiading Fellow-Villagers Association Provides Assistance</h3>
<p>An Helpless Woman is Threatened</p>
<p>A Letter is Sent to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association to Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>According to Li Guisu, a female fellow-villager of the Jiading Sojourners Association in Shanghai, she has been subjected to grievances and threats and is seeking assistance. A letter was sent to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association to inquire about the truth. The letter reads: "We are writing to inform you that yesterday, Li Zhangshi and her daughter Li Guisu, fellow villagers, came to the association and claimed that Guisu lost her parents at an early age. Zhangshi worked as a domestic helper in Shanghai. When Guisu was seventeen years old, she also came to Shanghai and worked as a female worker in the Japanese-owned Neiwai Spinning Mill on Robison Road in October of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Later, someone arranged for her to marry Wang Yaoqing, a Ningbo native who worked as a foreman in the same factory. Guisu's mother, because she only had one daughter and hoped to be together in life and death and burial in the future, instructed the matchmaker to explain to Wang Yaoqing, Wang readily agreed, so the marriage was arranged in November of that year, receiving a betrothal gift of one hundred yuan. Then, the January 28th incident of Japanese aggression in Zhabei occurred, and Shanghai went on strike. Guisu had no work to do. In this chaotic situation, the mother and daughter were helpless, so the matchmaker came and Wang Yaoqing lived together, so that there could be discussions if anything happened. At that time, Guisu's mother thought that since the marriage had been arranged, although the wedding ceremony had not been held, they would always be husband and wife in the future, so she agreed. During the intense warfare, Wang Yaoqing had no work to do and stayed at home all day. Without any suspicion, Guisu was seduced. Although they were not married, they had already shared a dream. At that time, they lived in Lane 2, Shankang Lane, Robison Road. Then, Guisu became pregnant, and Wang Yaoqing moved his family to No. 277, Yaozu Lane, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. In the first half of the 21st year, although the war had ended, the pregnant woman could not work. Wang Yaoqing was also unemployed, so Wang did not seek a way to make a living, but stayed at home drinking and gambling all day. Since the family had no savings, they had no choice but to pawn their belongings to survive. There are pawn tickets to prove it. Then, Guisu gave birth to a son, who died after five months. Wang Yaoqing then asked Guisu to be a wet nurse, receiving a child to raise, and using the wet nursing fee to cover the family's expenses. In reason, Wang Yaoqing relied on Guisu for his livelihood, and they should have been able to live in peace. However, Wang did not seek a living outside, but instead looked for trouble at home, scolding her when he had no wine, and even beating and abusing her. The situation was unbearable. When Wang Yaoqing was engaged, his betrothal money of one hundred yuan was originally borrowed. When he was unemployed, it had not been paid off. Guisu helped to repay it. There is a debt collector named Xiangfu Niang who can testify. Living like this, there was no joy in life. In desperation, Guisu went out to work as a wet nurse. Unexpectedly, Wang Yaoqing falsely accused Guisu of running away. Guisu avoided his fierce flames and sneaked back to her mother's home. Wang actually fabricated words to accuse her, falsely accusing Guisu of being familiar with someone, and falsely reported to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, and together they arrested Guisu and took her to the Xizang Hotel on Xizang Road, forcing her to pay ninety yuan to break off the relationship. Guisu's mother and daughter were originally lonely and helpless. Such a large sum of money was impossible to obtain. Li's mother reported to the police station, stating Guisu's suffering from threats and abuse. The police station inquired about the situation and released her, and ordered Wang Yaoqing not to engage in such private detention in the future. Who knows that the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association does not ask right from wrong, but listens to one side of the story, and even Yu Qiaqing comes forward to negotiate with the Public Works Department, which is so powerful. For this reason, they came to request assistance. They also brought a copy of the Ningbo Daily on December 12 and a copy of the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office's decision not to prosecute the defendants Wang Zhangshi, Wang Yaoqing, etc. The Standing Committee of our association decided that fellow villagers who have been wronged should be helped. If what Li Guisu said is true, then Wang Yaoqing's actions are inhumane. However, our association deeply feels that the content of this matter must be very complicated, and we cannot fully believe Li Guisu's mother and daughter's words. Your association has been handling this matter for a long time, and you must have a detailed investigation. Therefore, we have appointed Standing Committee Member Weng Guoxun to contact you and ask for details in person: (1) What is the relationship between Li Guisu and Wang Yaoqing? What was the previous dispute? (2) What is the truth about Li Guisu's claim that your association sent personnel to accompany Shi Yaoqing to arrest Li Guisu and take her to the Xizang Hotel on Xizang Road, forcing her to pay ninety yuan to break off the relationship? We hope that you can tell us. Sincerely, the Jiading Sojourners Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Large-Scale Muslim Delegation</h3>
<p>Going to Mecca to Pray</p>
<p>The Entire Delegation Consists of 126 People</p>
<p>Departing Today on a British Steamer</p>
<p>In recent years, Muslim believers in our country have gone to Mecca to perform the prayer ceremony. There have been seven previous delegations, and this year is the eighth. Its scale is larger than previous delegations, and the number of believers going to Mecca reaches more than 120. The China Travel Service has been preparing for days and has been very busy. The details will be described below, departing at 3:00 PM today:</p>
<p>Crowded Delegation This year, the Muslim believers participating in the prayer ceremony at the holy land of Mecca include a total of 110 male members such as Hei Ji, Ma Wenhui, Ma Tingxiang, Na Yanjin, Ye Weixin, Bai Chengyu, Fa Zhi, Hai Changqing, Zhan Deshan, Jin Sanli, Yang Shengchun, Mao Lantian, and Wang Jinde, 14 female believers including Ma Hongda's sister-in-law and two sisters, and two children, who are the sons of Mr. Ma Xiaodeng. Therefore, the total is 126 people. Ninety percent of the delegation members are from Gansu, and the rest are from Suiyuan, Chang'an, and Henan, with only about a dozen people. All of them arrived yesterday and gathered at the mosque, where Mr. Jin Ziyun took care of everything.</p>
<p>Completed Procedures The large number of believers this time is rare in previous delegations. Each believer going to Mecca must apply for a passport and undergo a medical examination. The procedures are very complicated. This matter was fully entrusted to Mr. Deng of the China Travel Service by Mr. Jin Ziyun of the local mosque to handle. Until yesterday, all passports had been obtained, and the medical examination of each believer was also conducted by four male and female doctors sent by the seaport inspection office, who examined each believer and issued a doctor's examination certificate, which was issued by the travel agency to each person for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Agreed on a Special Steamer Previously, Mr. Deng of the travel agency negotiated with the British Blue Funnel Line for the use of the Pyrrhus, a large ship of over 7,000 tons. All passenger seats were provided for the Muslim prayer delegation, and a direct voyage from Shanghai to Jeddah was requested. As a result of the negotiation, the Blue Funnel Line agreed to a direct voyage from the Pyrrhus to Jeddah, taking the route through Singapore. The Nanyang branch of the travel agency will take care of them when the ship arrives in Singapore. A telegram has been sent from Shanghai. After the believers disembark in Jeddah, they will travel by land to the holy land of Mecca. During this section, each person must ride a camel. It takes about five weeks from Shanghai to Mecca.</p>
<p>Travel Arrangements Of the entire delegation of 126 people, none of them know English, and most of the crew members of the Pyrrhus are British, and very few know Chinese. In order to facilitate the daily life of the delegation members and contact en route, the travel agency specially negotiated with the Blue Funnel Line to temporarily hire translator Mr. Ma Cunliang to serve as the interpreter for each believer and travel with the ship. The ship is specially equipped with Muslim food, mainly lamb. Each person will receive five taels of lamb every four days, and other foods will be provided intermittently, such as rice and noodles. A halal chef is specially hired in the kitchen to prepare dishes for each person. This time, the total cost of the round-trip travel expenses, including camel fees, etc., for all the believers going to Mecca for the pilgrimage is approximately 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Departing Today Yesterday afternoon, the China Travel Service notified each believer to send their luggage to the ship first. The Pyrrhus is docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. All the believers will gather at the New Customs Wharf at 10:30 AM today and take a small steam boat specially sent by the Blue Funnel Line to the big ship.

<h3>The Cai Yangqi Case Opens for the Eleventh Time</h3>
<p>Lang Zuyin Continues to Defy Summons</p>
<p>Yesterday's Hearing Endorsed with "Await Scheduled Hearing"</p>
<p>Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective from the Old Zhabei Police Station, arrested Cai Yangqi, a Chongming worker at the Longshun Gongdi freight company on Fujian Road Bridge South, during the spring in connection with a theft case at the company. Subsequently, the First Special District Court, after reviewing the case, found no evidence of Cai's involvement in banditry and ordered his release. After Cai returned home, his wife, Fan, seeing her husband injured and vomiting blood, filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Lang Zuyin and Bao Defu, the owner of the freight company, for assaulting her husband. This case has been ongoing for half a year, with the court holding eleven hearings. However, Lang Zuyin has consistently refused to accept the court's summons, citing orders from his superiors, and has failed to appear in court, making it impossible to begin the trial. Although the First Special Court petitioned the Ministry of Justice to forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the foreign legations concerned, requesting the Municipal Council to order Lang to surrender to allow the court to proceed according to law, these negotiations have yielded little result. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, when the case was scheduled for another hearing, Lang Zuyin still defied the summons and failed to appear. The presiding judge, Liu Yugui, endorsed the case with "Await Scheduled Hearing," indicating that there is no set date for the trial to begin.</p>
<h3>Details of the Lianxing Customs Patrol Ship Capturing Pirates</h3>
<p>Eleven Pirates and Twenty-Six Hostages</p>
<p>Sent to the Bureau for Interrogation Together at 2 PM Yesterday</p>
<p>Pirate activity has been erratic in the waters outside the Songkou port in recent years. Although customs patrol ships have been patrolling the area, there are many pirate gangs, and as one is suppressed, another rises. Incidents of looting ships and extorting ransoms continue to occur. On the afternoon of the 17th, the customs patrol ship Lianxing discovered a large sand barge that had been looted in the waters off Sheshan. After opening fire, they captured eleven pirates and rescued twenty-six hostages. Details of the pirate gang's origins and the capture are recorded below:</p>
<p>Pirate Life: The pirate gang consisted of twenty-eight members, equipped with handguns and Mauser pistols. They have no fixed address and have been roaming the seas for several years. They started by seizing a ship as their base, sharing food and lodging. They then continued to rob or kidnap people to make a living. They frequently switch ships, making it extremely difficult for patrol ships to track them down. Recently, they have expanded from one ship to two (both Ningbo-style sand barges). Except when they encounter patrol ships, which they quickly try to evade, they frequently roam the sea, causing much harm to merchant ships.</p>
<p>Kidnapping for Ransom: On the 11th of this month (Lunar November 5th), the pirates kidnapped Tong Zhubao and Zhou Pinsheng, two Ningbo natives who were catching crabs near Shenjiamen, and forced them to do hard labor, demanding a ransom of 200 yuan for each. On the 11th, they kidnapped Gong Bie, a shuangdang fisherman, in the same area. A "shuangdang" fisherman refers to two fishermen who jointly pull a net. The profit from each catch is managed by the trading company. The pirates only kidnapped one fisherman from each pair, instructing the other to report to the trading company and arrange for a ransom. They kidnapped eleven Ningbo people in total, including Liu Chuxing, Shi Shengxia, Tang Shunfa, Xin Linsheng, Xin Ali, Dong Linsheng, Yu Dingsong, Cai Zhongxing, Yu Zhengjin, Liu Jinsheng, and Qian Afa, demanding a ransom of 200 yuan per person.</p>
<p>Looting Sand Barge: Xu Bingyuan, the owner of the Jin Hongtai five-masted sand barge, sailed between Shanghai and other ports, transporting goods. The Shanghai end was managed by the Yuelai Company's Yifeng Yong on Hankou Road. On the 9th of this month, the Jin Hongtai loaded a large quantity of soybean cakes and Chinese cabbage in Qingdao and set sail for Shanghai. On the morning of the 16th, it reached the waters off Sheshan and encountered two pirate ships that were returning from kidnapping people in Ningbo. At around 10:00 AM, they met the Jin Hongtai sand barge. Seeing that the sand barge was large, with five sails, the pirates decided to seize it. They sped up their two ships to catch up and then opened fire with Mauser pistols, ordering the Jin Hongtai to stop. The two pirate ships surrounded the sand barge from both sides. The twenty-eight pirates transferred the thirteen hostages they had kidnapped to the sand barge, along with their weapons and equipment. They then forced the captain of the sand barge, Liu Yuwen, and the old helmsman, Zhan Mei, to steer the ship north. They said that there was not much food on board, only enough for the pirates, and that the hostages would have to starve. They planned to wait for someone to come and ransom the ship for 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Encountering the Lianxing: On the afternoon of the 17th, at 2:00 PM, the hostages had been starving for three meals and were exhausted. The sand barge had reached the Chenjiasha waters. At that time, the hostages were all driven onto the deck, while the pirates hid inside the cabin, with one or two on deck as lookouts. Suddenly, the Lianxing customs patrol ship arrived. Fearing exposure, the pirates threatened the captain, crew of fourteen, and the thirteen kidnapped people not to reveal their situation. If the patrol ship sent someone to investigate, they were to say that they were carrying goods north. If anyone revealed anything, they would be shot. The hostages all complied. When the Lianxing approached the sand barge, it sent four sailors, each carrying a rifle, and one Westerner, carrying a machine gun, on a motorboat. They boarded the sand barge to search for bandits or smuggled goods. The pirates remained hidden in the rear cabin and allowed the patrol ship's personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>Opening Fire to Resist Arrest: The patrol ship's sailors, noting that cargo ships traveling from point A to point B should have permits from each port, noticed that the permit stated the ship was traveling from Qingdao to Shanghai, but the ship was heading north, became suspicious and questioned them. The old helmsman, Zhan Mei, quietly reported that there were bandits on board. However, the pirates in the rear cabin overheard this and opened fire, firing about three or four shots. Seeing the situation, the sailors returned fire with four shots. The old helmsman was killed by the pirates. The sailors ordered the hostages on deck to retreat to the bow of the ship and raise their hands. Another Westerner brought the machine gun onto the sand barge and aimed it at the pirates in the rear cabin, preparing to fire. The pirates did not dare to resist. The sailors arrested three pirates on the spot and took them and the ten crew members onto the motorboat. The sailors and the Westerner also boarded the motorboat and left the sand barge, raising a flag to alert the patrol ship.</p>
<p>Patrol Ship Opens Fire: The crew on the patrol ship saw the signal and, after the motorboat had moved a safe distance away, opened fire with machine guns and cannons, bombarding the sand barge. They also fired sulfur bombs to set it on fire. The sand barge caught fire, and the pirates and the unrescued hostages had nowhere to escape, so they jumped into the sea to escape. The motorboat returned to rescue them, pulling three crew members from the sand barge, thirteen previously kidnapped hostages, and eight pirates from the water. Seventeen pirates were either killed or drowned, and the sand barge was destroyed. The body of the old helmsman, Zhan Mei, who was killed by the pirates, drifted away with the wreckage of the ship.</p>
<p>Captured Pirates Brought to Shanghai: The Lianxing patrol ship captured eleven pirates and rescued twenty-six kidnapped people. They sailed back to Wusongkou on the previous morning and telegraphed the customs water police, ordering all detectives to take a launch to Song to pick up the prisoners. After the pirates gave their names, including Chen Xingfu, Jiang Yulai, Zhang Cenqiu, Weng Banghuan, Xu Daofu, Wang Gongbai, Chen Xuechun, Jin Liangsa, Jiang Zhongbiao, Xu Yunbiao, and Xu Guibao, they were divided into two groups of hostages. The first group consisted of thirteen crab catchers and fishermen, and the eleven fishermen including Liu Chuxing (selling goods at Tuo Daxing Zhan), Shi Shengxia (Li Ayu selling goods), Tang Shunfa (Chen Amao selling goods), Xin Linsheng (Zhu Laizhou selling goods), Xin Ali (Ma Mingfu selling goods), Dong Linsheng (Lin Zhenghe selling goods), Yu Dingsong (Daxing Zhan selling goods), Cai Zhongxing (Xianglong Zhan selling goods), Yu Zhengjin (Wang Shengmao selling goods), Liu Jinsheng (Longxin Zhan selling goods), Qian Afa (Ma Axing selling goods). The second group consisted of the sand barge captain Liu Yuwen, Shi Jingui, Fang Zhaofu, and crew members Zhou Liansheng, Cui Bufa, Zhong Jintai, Chen Changzhi, Zhu Changqing, Wei Zhengshan, Zhou Hongyin, Wu Fumu, Chen Dianru, and Huang Qiaosheng, totaling thirteen people. One of the pirates, Jin Liangyu, had been shot in the right leg. After interrogation by the detectives, the eleven pirates were transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for disposal that evening. The twenty-six hostages, along with Jin Liangmao, a wounded pirate previously captured by the Wenxing patrol ship, who had recovered from his injuries, were sent to the bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon at 2 PM.</p>
<h3>Yongxing Warship on Patrol</h3>
<p>Pursues and Captures Qingbin Pirates</p>
<p>Over Ten Killed and Captured Alive</p>
<p>Rescues Squad Leader and Weapons</p>
<p>China News Agency reports that the Ningbo Association in Shanghai received reliable information yesterday that a freezer ship docked at Qingbin Island in Dinghai County the day before yesterday. The first independent squad of the local basic cadre team went to inspect it. They found three quick-firing guns, but the licenses were complete, and local people confirmed that it was a freezer ship, so they did not conduct a strict investigation. However, at 1:00 PM, more than ten people suddenly rushed out of the ship with various firearms, attacking the squad, killing one guard and one militiaman, and abducting squad leader Zhou Zhicheng, seizing all the weapons of the squad. They then sailed away on the freezer ship. The militiamen went to Puzi Lake to call for help. The Yongping warship happened to be patrolling nearby, so they requested the ship to pursue and rescue them. Five pirates were killed on the spot, six were captured alive, and four jumped into the sea. Squad leader Zhou Zhicheng was rescued, and all the weapons were recovered. The brigade headquarters received a telegram from the captain of the Yongping warship reporting the incident yesterday.</p>
<h3>Judgment in French Concession Gambling Scam Case</h3>
<p>Yang Yingchu Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Cai Baoshan Detained for Over Three Months and Fined</p>
<p>Yang Yingchu, a 58-year-old Cantonese residing at No. 13 Dakang Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession, fabricated rumors due to extreme poverty. He claimed that the current French Consul-General, Meili Ai, was on leave to return to France, and the new Consul would revitalize the market by allowing the establishment of gambling dens in the concession, and that he could arrange to obtain the licenses. He colluded with fellow villagers Yang Dingguo, Pan Shucan, Wang Baiqing, Cai Baoshan from Pudong, and Zhu Zhenhua from Changzhou to spread the word and seek investors. The French police discovered the scheme and sent two translators from the anti-gambling squad, Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang, disguised as investors Hong Bingan and his accountant Zhang Zhongan, to the Dadongxin Hotel on Xixin Bridge Street and the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street on the 30th of last month and the 1st of this month. They gathered Yang and others to discuss investment plans. Yang and others claimed that a capital of one million yuan was required to organize the venture, and that there were only five licenses available, two of which had already been taken by a Mr. Sun, and that each license would cost 45,000 yuan in official fees. The two parties actually entered into a contract. When the contract was completed, police detectives lurking at the Dafang Hotel, including Hang Bingquan, Cai Zongyi, He Zongyu, and Zhu Junpei, arrested Yang Yingchu and six others, as well as suspects Fu Fengshan (from Guangdong) and Pi Xichun (from Henan), in Room 301 of the Dafang Hotel at around 8:00 PM on the 1st. They searched Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan's residence, finding documents related to the establishment of a lottery house, including articles of association and contracts. The police concluded the investigation and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Yang Yingchu and Cai Baoshan were charged with fraud as a habitual offense under Article 364 of the Criminal Code, while the other six defendants were charged with fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Judge Sun Pengya ruled that the charges against Yang and Cai were not under his jurisdiction and ordered them to be transferred to the local court for trial. On the morning of the 17th, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the local court convened a hearing in the First Tribunal, where the defendants hired lawyers to defend themselves. The proceedings were concluded, and a verdict was awaited. The details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the verdict was announced. At noon, Judge Zhang went to the First Criminal Tribunal and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. Yang Yingchu was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for participating in an organization aimed at committing crimes. Cai Baoshan (same charge) was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Wang Baiqing, Pan Shucan, Yang Dingguo, and Zhu Zhenhua (same charge) were each fined 200 yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment will be credited at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If the fine is converted, each day will be calculated at three yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment will be credited at a rate of one day for three yuan of fine. The articles of association and regulations for the lottery house and the contract for the organization of the lottery house were confiscated. Fu Fengshan and Pi Xichun were found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Maoli Steamer Arrives Safely in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Details of Foiled Pirate Attempt</p>
<p>Yili Also Arrives After Great Scare</p>
<p>The Maoli steamer of the Maoli Steamship Company, located at No. 4 Hengxin Lane, Outer Bund, Nanshi, left Shanghai on the 13th of this month (last Thursday). Pirates disguised as passengers hid in the cabins, attempting to hijack the ship mid-route. The ship arrived in Dinghai the next day at noon, where the water police discovered the pirates' weapons. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Further details are reported below:</p>
<p>First Mate Details the Incident: The Maoli steamer returned to Shanghai at 8:20 AM yesterday morning and docked at Pier No. 10 in Nanshi. A reporter from this newspaper visited the company and spoke with manager Miao Shuizhang. The Maoli's first mate was also present and was asked about the incident. According to him, the ship left Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 13th, carrying over a hundred passengers. Around 9:00 AM the next morning, the ship arrived in Dinghai but did not dock, anchoring in the sea. The water police boarded the ship and discovered one male pirate, one female pirate, a 13-year-old girl, and a baby in the female pirate's arms. The female inspector found a wooden-cased pistol with fourteen bullets hidden in the female pirate's crotch. More than ten bullets were found in the male pirate's luggage. The water police questioned the pirate about whether there were any accomplices on board. The female pirate only stated that she was from Haimen Bei and that there were four others in Shanghai, but the Maoli steamer left an hour early that day, and they might not have been able to catch up and might have taken the Yili steamer to Wenzhou. The rest of her statement was evasive. She was taken to the police station by the water police for questioning.</p>
<p>Did Not Dare to Sail to Shipu: After the water police, together with the ship's police, conducted a thorough search of the passengers and luggage in the cabins, they allowed the ship to continue to Haimen and Huangyan at 5:00 PM that afternoon, escorted by police officers. However, they did not sail to Shipu Pier because of the previous accident involving the Xinhai Men steamer, where pirates boarded the ship. As they were wary, passengers and goods destined for Shipu were transferred to the Xinhai Men steamer. The Xinhai Men happened to be in Dinghai on the same day and met the Maoli steamer.</p>
<p>Today's Scheduled Sailing: The reporter from Datong News Agency requested to interview the ship owner, Xu Baosheng, but he had already disembarked. The reporter then visited manager Miao Shuizhang at the company. According to Mr. Miao, the ship had six escort police officers led by Captain Yang Baolian. Although the incident was unexpected, they were fortunate to escape danger. In the future, they will pay special attention to passengers with suspicious behavior to ensure safety. The scheduled sailing tomorrow (today) will proceed as usual, loading passengers and cargo and leaving at 5:00 PM for a certain port.</p>
<p>Yili Greatly Alarmed: The reporter from Datong News Agency then went to the Lianan Steamship Company at No. 16 Pu Guanqiao to inquire about the situation on the Yili steamer. The pirates captured in Dinghai revealed that there were four other accomplices on the Yili steamer bound for Wenzhou on the same day. The company received a telegram from Dinghai on the afternoon of the 14th, and the company sent a wireless telegram to the Yili steamer, warning them to be careful. They also sent a telegram to the Wenzhou branch, ordering them to quickly report to the local police and inspect the Yili in the Jiangxin area as soon as it arrived in Wenzhou without waiting for it to dock.</p>
<p>Thorough Search in Jiangxin, Wenzhou: When the Yili steamer arrived in Wenzhou at 2:00 PM on the 15th, the water police conducted a thorough search in the Jiangxin area, but found nothing. It is feared that the pirates may have disembarked mid-route, or secretly discarded their weapons. The Yili steamer also returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday and will load passengers and cargo as usual today, sailing to the ports of Dinghai, Kanmen, Yueqing, and Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>Railways Bureau Advises Fourth-Class Passengers</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to Safety and Hygiene</p>
<p>Printed Popular Leaflets Distributed on Trains</p>
<p>Do Not Jump Off the Train Before It Comes to a Complete Stop</p>
<p>The Railways Bureau, in light of the numerous accidents that have occurred on trains, resulting in injuries and deaths, mostly due to passengers' carelessness, especially among fourth-class passengers, and the difficulty in maintaining cleanliness on fourth-class carriages, has assigned Liu Junming from the General Affairs Department and Hu Shisan from the Transportation Department to explain the dangers of jumping off trains and walking on the tracks to fourth-class passengers, as well as the importance of maintaining public hygiene on trains. The officers have prepared a "Notice to Fourth-Class Passengers" leaflet, printing 40,000 copies, to be distributed during lectures to promote awareness. The text of the leaflet is published below: (1) Do not get on or off the train before it has come to a complete stop. Jumping off the train can lead to serious injury or death. (2) Do not fall asleep on the train, as you may miss your stop. If you have already passed your stop, you can report to the ticket inspector. Do not jump off the train while it is in motion, as this can lead to serious accidents. (3) Passengers must purchase tickets according to regulations. Do not try to be clever, as taking shortcuts, such as jumping off the train or standing on the footboard outside the door, is very dangerous and not worth the risk. (4) Do not stand in the doorway or between carriages, as you may fall and be injured. (5) Do not stick your head out of the window, as you may be injured. (6) When walking along the railway tracks, be sure to move out of the way when you see a train approaching. Do not cross the tracks or walk near the tracks to avoid injury. People living near the railway tracks must strictly prohibit children from playing near the tracks to avoid accidents. (7) People with infectious or serious illnesses should not travel by train to avoid spreading the illness to others and worsening their own condition. (8) Everyone should help maintain the cleanliness of the toilets. Do not litter paper, fruit peels, or other waste. Gather them in one place for cleaning. (9) Do not spit, litter cigarette butts, or put your feet on the seats. (10) If you find anything unclean on the train, you can ask the attendant to clean it. If they refuse, you can report it to the railway officer on board for resolution.</p>
<h3>Xinhai Men Steamer Crew and Passengers</h3>
<p>Tragically Killed by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>Shipu Pirates Surrounded by Soldiers and Police</p>
<p>The Xinhai Men steamer of the Xinhai Men Steamship Company was hijacked by pirates en route from Yong to Wen. After the soldiers and police encircled and suppressed them, the pirates released all the kidnapped crew and passengers when they realized the situation was critical. As a result, some were killed by stray bullets, while others were rescued by the soldiers and police. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>First Mate and Passengers Tragically Killed: After the incident, the Sixth Regiment of the Zhejiang Security Corps and the Second Water Police Team, along with the local military and police, launched an attack on the pirate's den near Yanshan, Niushenmen, Taizhou. The pirates resisted, but were overpowered by the soldiers and police. They released the kidnapped passengers and crew. The Xinhai Men steamer's first mate, Zhang Shixuan, son-in-law of ship owner He Shengzhang, and a passenger surnamed Jia, a graduate of Jinling University, were killed by stray bullets. Their bodies are being held in Haimen. The other crew and passengers were rescued safely.</p>
<p>Soldiers and Police Encircle: The soldiers and police have now implemented a large-scale encirclement, dispatching armed troops and land and water police to seal off the pirate-infested area near Shipu, aiming to eliminate the root of the problem. Therefore, the pirates, except for those who have already been killed, cannot escape.</p>
<h3>Haixing Fishing Boat Captain</h3>
<p>Beaten for Not Joining the Union</p>
<p>Chen Youtu and Others Accused of Assault</p>
<p>The Verdict Will Be Announced at Five O'Clock Today After Yesterday's Hearing</p>
<p>Xin Shanzhong, a Ningbo native and captain of the Haixing fishing boat, lived in the Guanqiao area of the Nanshi district. Because Xin had not joined the Fishing Boat Industry Workers' Improvement Association, Chen Youtu, the standing director of the association, along with several others, went to Xin Shanzhong's home around 6 or 7 PM on the 23rd of last month. They beat Xin and his wife, Zheng, and destroyed their belongings. Still not satisfied, they dragged Xin to the Fishing Boat Industry Workers' Improvement Association hall near Dongtingshan Alley. Upon hearing the news, the local police station quickly dispatched a large number of officers to the scene and arrested Chen Youtu, Le Junxie, Dai Shansheng, Yu Ruilian, Dong Afa, Le Huixiang, Yang Maogen, Zhu Bisheng, Zhou Pingying, Wang Yuesheng, and others who had committed the assault. Together with the injured Xin Shanzhong and Xin Zheng, they were taken to the police station and then transferred to the local court. Prosecutor Wu Deying proposed the case and interrogated them. After further summoning Shi Youxiao (also known as Youqiao) and others for questioning, it was determined that Chen Youtu, Le Junxie, Dai Shansheng, Le Huixiang, Yu Ruilian, Dong Afa, and Shi Youxiao should be detained on charges of assault, property damage, and restriction of freedom. The remaining individuals were released on bail pending further investigation. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Guan Liting presided over the hearing in the tenth courtroom. The defendants, Chen Youtu and others, hired lawyers such as Yu Hualong to represent them in court. According to Xin Shanzhong's testimony, he was 37 years old and from Ningbo. He had just become the captain of the Haixing fishing boat on October 19th. Chen Youtu from the workers' union ordered me to join, but I refused. Chen Youtu gathered more than 40 people and rushed to my home, beating my wife and me and destroying all the items in my house. They also dragged my wife and me, along with my 12-year-old child Guangming, to the workers' union hall a good distance from my house. The injuries I sustained have not yet healed, and so on. Next, Xin Zheng testified that she was 30 years old, and the rest of her testimony was the same as her husband's. The judge ordered Chen Youtu to be brought to court for questioning. He was 42 years old, from Ningbo, and worked as a standing director in the fishing boat industry union, earning a monthly salary of 60 yuan. My union's duty is to mediate, so how could I instigate a crowd to commit violence? This lawsuit occurred because Xin Shanzhong was instructed by others. That day, dozens of people suddenly rushed to the union hall and destroyed the belongings, causing the glass on the premier's frame to fall and injure Xin's forehead. He denied the assault. Yu Ruilian testified that he was 32 years old, from Ningbo. That day, I was eating in the kitchen. When I heard the noise and went outside, I was arrested. I don't know anything else. Zhou Chuanhua was also mistakenly arrested and died of illness two days after being released on bail by the court. Dong Afa testified that he was 28 years old, from Ningbo, and made a living by fishing. That day, I went to the union hall to ask if there was any mail from home. They started arguing, and I got scared and hid, but I was caught by the police. Le Junxie testified that he was 34 years old, from Ningbo, and lived near Xiangyan Bridge. He worked as an inspector in the union, earning a monthly salary of ten yuan, and also denied the assault. Dai Shansheng testified that he was 27 years old, from Dinghai, and made a living by fishing. That day, I went to the union hall to find a friend and was mistakenly arrested. Le Huixiang testified that he was 28 years old, from Ningbo, and worked on a fishing boat. That day, after the fishing boat docked, I went to the union hall to visit friends and chat, and I was also arrested. Shi Youxiao testified that he was 28 years old, from Ningbo, and was a director in the union, responsible for collecting donations. There are seven directors in the union. I was not at the scene at the time. Later, I was summoned by the court. After hearing the testimony, the judge ordered Xin Shanzhong and Xin Zheng to identify Chen Youtu and others as the perpetrators in court. Xin Shanzhong also said that Shi Youxiao knocked out his teeth and that he was the main culprit. At this point, Prosecutor Wu Deying arrived in court and made his arguments. Then, the defense began. Lawyers Yu Hualong and Ma Yizhong rose to defend the defendants Chen Youtu and others for a long time. Finally, Dai Ningrui, the lawyer representing the plaintiff in the private prosecution, requested an additional 30 yuan and seven jiao for medical and funeral expenses, as well as compensation for other losses, and would file another lawsuit separately. The judge asked Chen Youtu how he would respond to the private prosecution. Chen replied that he was willing to pay compensation. The judge, considering the case to be clear, concluded the hearing and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 10 AM on the 15th. The seven defendants, including Chen Youtu, were returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<h3>Further Interrogation of Accomplices in the Tang Jiapeng Case</h3>
<p>The Police Are Still Investigating</p>
<p>Request for a Seven-Day Extension</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, a Ningbo native and former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, also known as Shi Ayu, was suddenly assassinated by gunmen instigated by his enemies in front of the Great World gate at 1 AM on June 18th of last year. At the same time, a pedestrian named Wu Xiancai from Yangzhou was killed by stray bullets. Afterwards, Jin Jiulin, the director of the special agency of the French Concession Police, and detectives successively arrested the murderers, Zhang Xiaosizi from Funing and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, and confiscated a handgun used in the killing. They were handed over to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for murder. Zhang was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment. The two convicts were dissatisfied and are currently appealing to the Supreme Court in the third instance. Recently, based on the confession of Zhao Guangfu, Lang Bole, the Western Inspector of the Second Detective Group of the French Concession Police, found that Wang Xinggao, a Funing native residing on Menggu Road in Zhabei, was involved in the case. On the evening of the 13th of this month, at 11 PM, it was learned that Wang was in Room 537 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. He immediately led detectives Wang Rusong and Guo Shaorong, together with the Laozha Police Station, and dispatched detectives to the Central Hotel, arrested Wang, and brought him back to the police station. The next day, he was handed over to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. These details have already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Xiong Huicui, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, ascended to the first court and ordered the defendant to be brought in for trial. According to Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer for the police station, the police investigation in this case has not yet been completed, and he requested a further seven-day extension for a detailed investigation, and so on. The defendant's lawyer presented four letters of appointment of defendant Wang Xinggao serving in the political circles for years. The judge briefly questioned the defendant a few words, and then approved the change of date to the 26th for further trial. The defendant remained in custody. When the case was being heard, many relatives and friends of the defendant were present in court, and they dispersed in a rush after the adjournment.</p>
<h3>Dai Awu Makes a Living by Specializing in Robbery</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Armed Detectives Went to Arrest Him</p>
<p>Dai's Wife Lost Her Footing and Pleaded for Help</p>
<p>Dai Awu, a resident of No. 7 Zhizhong Li, Baliaoqiao Road (also known as West Xinqiao Street) in the French Concession, is about 30 years old. His wife, surnamed Mou, is in her twenties, with permed hair and fashionable clothes. They have a four-year-old son named Bao Bao and employ a nanny. The furniture in the house is all made of rosewood and sandalwood. Those who do not know them suspect that he is a wealthy merchant. When neighbors asked his wife what her husband did for a living, she falsely claimed that he was a comprador on a foreign ship. In fact, Dai has no occupation and specializes in robbery as a business, living lavishly and having disciples. Because the secret was not well kept, it was discovered by the French Concession Police. Yesterday (the 19th), at dawn, a large number of armed detectives were specially dispatched to arrest him at his address. The detectives were quiet and inconspicuous, driving a truck to the location and managing to enter No. 7. The detectives rushed upstairs to Dai's bedroom, where Dai Awu was fast asleep, and he was captured. His wife took the opportunity to escape to the drying platform and fled from the roof into the skylight of No. 6. Because the woman was anxious and panicked, she lost her footing and fell, suffering minor injuries and pleading for help. As a result, she was still arrested by the detectives. After a brief interrogation, they were both taken to the Lujiawan French Concession Police Station in a truck, awaiting transfer to the court for trial. It was also heard that the detectives found a handgun and dozens of bullets under the washbasin in Dai's bedroom, which were also taken back to the police station.</p>
<h3>Cruel and Brutal Abuse of a Maidservant</h3>
<p>Wooden Sticks, Rattan Canes, and Branding Irons All Prepared</p>
<p>Chen Wu's Behavior Is Truly Inhumane</p>
<p>Xu Xingbao, a 12-year-old girl from Changshu, was sold by her parents to a Cantonese woman named Chen Wu at No. 723 Tianqing Road as an adopted daughter last summer for 50 yuan. Unexpectedly, recently, if the girl made a slight mistake in her work, Wu would beat her with wooden sticks and rattan canes, leaving her body covered in injuries, and would also brand her back with a branding iron and strike her fingers with a small hammer. The girl, around 9 PM the day before yesterday, took a hot water bottle outside to get hot water from a nearby stove. She broke the bottle and cried on the way, not daring to return home. A patrolling Chinese constable investigated and learned the truth. He took her to the Hongkou Police Station. After a while, Wu came to the police station to look for Xu. She was detained, and a search of her bed resulted in the discovery of wooden sticks, rattan canes, and a branding iron and small hammer in the drawer. The police chief ordered her to send the girl to the orphanage and be held in custody. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special Court's Third Criminal Tribunal. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the facts and said that Xu was examined at the Tongren Hospital and found to have branding iron marks on her back and waist, as well as countless scars on her arms and legs. The defendant was truly inhumane and should be severely punished. All the evidence was presented to the court. Xu testified that she called the defendant "aunt," but she was beaten with wooden sticks and rattan canes for not doing her work well. Sometimes she was beaten two or three times a day, or once every few days. If the laundry was not clean, her fingers, back, and waist would be struck with a hammer. About a week ago, she was branded with a branding iron. All of this was true. When questioned, Wu's testimony was evasive, admitting only that she had slightly hit her with a wooden stick because she had stolen money. Lawyer Li rose and said that Xu did not want to return to her hometown because her parents ate opium and were poor and had sold her. If she returned home, she would be treated the same way. He requested that she be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. The court approved this. Judge Wu Zehan ordered Chen Wu to be returned to custody and scheduled a later date to review the case. Xu was to be re-examined by a forensic doctor to verify the injuries.</p>
<h3>Abduction and Rape Case</h3>
<p>Zeng Yang's Motives Are Unsavory</p>
<p>Xu Yinxun's Behavior Is Despicable</p>
<p>Wei Hanchen, a native of Anhui residing at No. 14, Alley 87, Jing'an Temple Road, has been unemployed for a long time, resulting in poverty for his family. He entrusted his 16-year-old daughter, Liandi, to be a nanny at the home of Mrs. Dai Yin at No. 146, Alley 1238, Fuxu Road. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, around 2 PM, Wei Liandi was out shopping when she met a fellow villager, Mrs. Zeng Yang, at the entrance of the alley. Seeing that the girl was young and easily deceived, she took the opportunity to coax her and was eventually lured away. Mrs. Zeng led her to the home of her lover, Xu Yinxun, at No. 18, Alley 990, Jia'zhi Road in the Nanshi district, intending to sell her. That night, Mrs. Zeng, Xu, and Wei Liandi slept in the same bed. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, Xu was suddenly overcome with lust and used violent means to rape Wei repeatedly. The girl was unable to resist and was violated. The next day, she secretly asked someone to send a letter to Chen Zhihuan, a neighbor of her employer, begging for rescue and recounting what had happened. Chen reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Liu Ronggen and patrolman Ni Jiafeng. At 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, together with police detectives from the Public Security Bureau, they arrested Zeng Yang, Xu Yinxun, and Wei Liandi at No. 18, Jia'zhi Road, and took them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, filed a public prosecution against Mrs. Zeng and Xu, charging them with violating family integrity under Article 257 of the Criminal Code and rape and aiding and abetting rape under Article 240 of the Criminal Code. As this case involved public morals, the court ordered that no one be allowed to observe the trial. As a result of the trial, the court ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody separately, pending the announcement of the verdict this Saturday. Wei Liandi was taken back by her father, Wei Hanchen.</p>
<h3>Li Shilin Appeals Against Zhang Xiangwen and Others</h3>
<p>Ma Xiangbo Is Engaged in Mediation</p>
<p>There Is Still Hope for a Settlement</p>
<p>Li Shilin, a local resident who resides at No. 24, Shangxianfang, Xiafei Road in the French Concession and operates the Donghua Construction Engineering Company on Beijing Road, is 40 years old this year. His wife, Li Wang (also known as Wang Zhifen), is about 35 or 36 years old and has given birth to six children. On June 29th of this year, she was at full term for her seventh pregnancy and was sent to the Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Obstetrics Hospital behind their residence to await delivery. After being admitted to the hospital, she gave birth to a son that morning. Unexpectedly, after giving birth, Wang's fever suddenly increased. Li went to visit her, but no doctor examined her. He then hired doctors Chen and Diao to examine her at the hospital, who diagnosed her with puerperal fever. He then had Wang transported home, but medical treatment was ineffective, and she died on July 12th. Afterwards, Li Shilin, grieving the death of his wife Wang due to the negligence of the Shangxian Hall Women and Children's Hospital in failing to provide early diagnosis and treatment, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing the hospital director Zhang Xiangwen, doctor Ge Chenghui, and head nurse Gu Qinyan of negligence in their duties, resulting in death, and requested that they be investigated and punished according to the law. The court, based on the complaint, repeatedly held hearings presided over by Judge Wang Gangxu, summoned witnesses from both sides for questioning, and sent letters to medical organizations for expert appraisal. As a result of the trial, the three defendants were found not guilty. These details have already been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the plaintiff Li Shilin was not satisfied with the original trial verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court, based on the complaint, opened an investigation hearing yesterday morning presided over by Judge Sun Honglin. Both sides, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The judge first questioned both parties about their age, origin, address, and occupation. Then, the appellant Li Shilin stated the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the original trial verdict and the points of his appeal, and said that Mr. Ma Xiangbo had been engaged in mediation, but it suddenly failed last night, so he had to appear in court today. The lawyer representing the appellant, Yan Yinwu, said that there was still hope for a settlement in this case and requested the court to postpone the hearing. According to the defense lawyer for the appellee, Mr. Ma Xiangbo came forward to mediate and issued a statement in the newspaper to clarify the misunderstanding between the two parties, but both parties were unwilling to bear the cost of the advertisement, which led to the suspension of the mediation. The judge said that the medical issues in the case needed to be investigated in detail, so he adjourned the hearing and ordered that it be rescheduled for further questioning. Then, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Forging Collateral Receipts</h3>
<p>Using Them to Deceive Creditors</p>
<p>Wu Xinglong Sentenced to Six Months' Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wu Xinglong, a native of Zhenjiang, has been working as a bookkeeper in hotels. Previously, he borrowed 100 yuan from his relative Gan Zhongchu. Recently, Gan was pressing him urgently for repayment, so he had a wild idea and forged a collateral receipt for 150 yuan from the Baohua Hotel, which is under the jurisdiction of the Wufu Travel Company, and mortgaged it to Gan. Recently, Gan was in urgent need of money, so he took the collateral receipt to Baohua Hotel to redeem the cash the day before yesterday morning. Xu Wenzhao, the manager of the hotel, examined it and realized that it was forged, so he asked where it came from and learned that it was given by Wu. He then went to find Wu. Xu Wenzhao thought that the amount of this receipt might not be the only one and that if he did not investigate it strictly, there would be more complications in the future, so he reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered detective Chen Shanji to arrest Wu and take him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court's First Criminal Tribunal. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer for the police station, stated the facts of the case and filed a public prosecution based on the crime of forging documents under Article 224 of the Criminal Code. Then, Xu Wenzhao testified, proving that the receipt was forged and requesting that he be punished according to the law. When questioned, Wu Xinglong said that he was in financial difficulty and that Gan was urgently demanding repayment, so he had no choice but to resort to this tactic, but the receipt was forged by a Mr. Huang. Judge Feng Shide, after reviewing the testimony, sentenced Wu Xinglong to six months' imprisonment for forging documents as a warning.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Representatives Petitioned the City Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Detained Publicly Owned Licenses</p>
<p>Requesting Their Return to Maintain the Livelihoods of Rickshaw Pullers</p>
<p>In the rickshaw industry in this city, there is a type of license that is publicly owned. These licenses were handed over to the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association by the Public Utilities Bureau of the municipal government in 1928 for management, leased to poor tenants, and the license fees obtained were used for the public welfare expenses of rickshaw pullers. This year, in August, Ju Ganxin, a member of the rickshaw industry association, reported to the Public Utilities Bureau that the 64 publicly owned licenses were now in the hands of general large rickshaw businesses and that the license fees obtained were not being used for public welfare purposes. The Public Utilities Bureau, based on the report, detained the licenses and stopped issuing them. Subsequently, after mediation by the rickshaw industry association and with Ju's understanding, the Public Utilities Bureau withdrew the complaint. However, the Public Utilities Bureau stated that the vehicles using these licenses were mostly old and damaged and would only be issued after the vehicles were replaced. However, the license holders and the rickshaw industry association believe that the licenses have been suspended for three months, and those who rely on these licenses for a living include the rickshaw pullers and their families, totaling several hundred people. Prolonging the detention would cause extreme hardship to their lives. Therefore, at 11 AM yesterday morning, Zhang Huaiyang and Wang Rongqing, representatives of the rickshaw industry association, Zhang Wenhua and Lu Jinyu, representatives of the license holders, and Yuan Hongjun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, jointly petitioned the municipal government. Zhu Weiyao was dispatched by the municipal government to receive them and promised to forward their request to the municipal government's rickshaw research committee for proper handling. The representatives then left one after another. Zhang Huaiyu, a standing committee member of the rickshaw industry association, also said that since the 64 licenses were detained by the Public Utilities Bureau, those who relied on these licenses for a living had lost their means of support, which has been the case for three months. In fact, these licenses are not manipulated by large rickshaw businesses, but are leased out through large rickshaw businesses. Currently, to maintain the livelihoods of the rickshaw pullers, they have decided to continue to request the rickshaw research committee to return the licenses.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrests of Robbers in the Dalin Road Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Following the robbery of a large sum of money and gold jewelry from the home of Jiang Heshang (also known as Jiang Changfu) at No. 1, Alley 18, Dalin Road in the Nanshi district the day before yesterday, the Sangguantang Police Station reported it to the Ximen Branch. Patrol Captain He and others were immediately dispatched to cooperate with the Sangguantang police to pursue the robbers separately. They exchanged fire with the bandits along the way and arrested the robbers Han Huaicheng and You Changfu on the spot, seizing two handguns, one six-inch and one four-inch, as well as ammunition. This has already been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that yesterday, the director of the Ximen Branch sent the two arrested robbers to the stationed detective team for investigation. According to the robbers' confessions, their accomplices, Li Asi, Wang Dehuai, and Wang Ruiqing, were hiding in the concession. Therefore, Detective Leader Shen Wenda led detectives Fang Lingeng, Yu Ruhai, and Liu Wenhui, along with Police Officer Lin of the branch, to the French Concession late at night. In cooperation with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police, they arrested a suspect named Zhang Zhiliang at the Baliaoqiao intersection on Xiafei Road. At the same time, they went to No. 54, Siming Hotel, Xizilaihuo Street, to arrest Li Asi, but he was at large. Li's lover, Zhang Yin, a native of Pudong, was taken back to the bureau for questioning. They also went to the former building of Zhizhongli on Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession and continued to arrest a suspect named Dai Junqing (who had worked as an employee in the water patrol team) and Dai's wife, Wang. A six-inch Browning handgun, No. 302174, twelve bullets, and two magazines were seized from the drawer of the dressing table and taken to the bureau. After Director Li of the branch briefly questioned them one by one, except for the arrest of the fugitive Li Asi and others for investigation, the six arrested robbers and suspects, both male and female, were all sent to the General Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Two Route Party Headquarters Sent Personnel to Reorganize the Two Route Trade Unions</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Trade Unions have been established since September 1931, more than three years ago. The organizations have not been sound, so the work cannot be promoted. Last December, they also planned to end on their own and requested the superior to send personnel to reorganize. The special party headquarters of the road at that time considered the situation to be tense and the labor movement could not be interrupted, and reported to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee for approval, ordering the trade union to continue to be responsible, and must prepare for re-election in the shortest period of time, but it has not been implemented to this day. The two special party headquarters of the road deliberated again and again, and deeply thought that the organization of the association cannot be expected as before. Prolonging it like this, not only will guidance be difficult, but it will also hinder the future of the labor movement. Therefore, on the 18th of the day before yesterday, the 96th executive committee meeting was convened, and it was decided to reorganize the organization and implement the reorganization in accordance with the central regulations on the reorganization of people's organizations. It is now learned that Zhang Yunhe, Zhang Ji, and Chen Junpei were appointed as instructors, and Pan Qin, Hong Desheng, Luo Lairong, Xue Jie, and Yuan Qiaofu and other five people were appointed as reorganizers. Yesterday, they were ordered to stop activities immediately. The reorganization period is limited to two months to complete the official re-election and the establishment of the trade union. They immediately reported to the Central Executive Committee's People's Movement Committee and Organization Committee for record, and sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways and the Two Route Administration Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor, I am writing to you regarding the news article "Major Fraud Case of Opening a Gambling Den in the French Concession" published in your newspaper yesterday (18th). I was surprised to read that one of the defendants, Zhu Zhenhua, stated that he was engaged in construction. Upon investigation, I found that the defendant not only shares the same surname and name as myself, but also has a similar occupation. In fact, it must be another person. However, my relatives and friends have been asking me about it, causing a lot of misunderstanding. Therefore, in addition to entrusting lawyer Zhang Guangheng to publish a statement in the newspaper, I am writing to request that a correction be included in the corrections column to clarify the truth. I pray that you will do so. Sincerely, Zhu Zhenhua, Architect.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: A Poor Girl Should Not Be Ashamed to Become a Teacher, and a Western Guest Is Not Worth Respecting, Only Humiliating a Humble Heart</p>
<p>If you don't think the method I've described is satisfactory, then he will still be named Zhu and I will still be named Jia. What else is there to talk about? When Yueying heard this, she realized that after being looked at for so long and having her hand touched, the other party wasn't necessarily going to take her. A poor girl has so little status. She felt a pain in her heart, and tears were about to stream down her face. However, Hu's wife didn't feel anything. She felt that this was how business should be done. She asked, "According to Master Jia, how should it be done?" Jia Duocai swayed his body, ready to say what he wanted to say, but he heard someone calling out, "Brother Jia, are you home?" Jia Duocai recognized the voice as Li Shilian's. So, he replied, "At home, at home." As he said this, he rushed out the door and stopped Li Shilian. He said in a low voice, "That little thing is in my room." Li Shilian narrowed his eyes and said with a smile, "You are really something. You actually got him first." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "Don't talk nonsense. There's still a woman with bound feet accompanying me in the room. We were just discussing the conditions." Li Shilian raised his head, hesitated, and pondered, "This is very inconvenient." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "What? Are you talking about the woman from yesterday? I stand corrected, I stand corrected." Li Shilian said seriously, "This is a serious matter, not a joke. Haven't two Germans just arrived in this Little Western Paradise? They came on the same train as me." Jia Duocai said, "What are you bringing up foreigners for?" Li Shilian said, "His Chinese assistant, Zhao Guofu, told me that the two Germans want to talk to you." Jia Duocai said, "Really? What do they want to talk to me about?" Li Shilian said, "I don't know. Since he specially asked me to inform you, there must be something they want to discuss. Why don't you talk to him? But you have a female guest in your room, so it seems inconvenient to have him come over now." (94)</p>
<h3>In the Thick Fog</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Although it was only two days before the full moon, the fog covered the entire sea. Not only was the moonlight completely blocked by the fog, but even the strong searchlights could not reach beyond ten feet. The foghorn on the ocean liner kept sounding, but in the thick fog, it sounded like a child blowing a toy trumpet.</p>
<p>Xu Changxing's large sand boat was fully loaded with goods, heading from Tianjin to Shanghai. Although that night it had reached only twenty nautical miles from the Songkou, and they were preparing to work hard all night to catch the early tide to enter the port, the thick fog blocked the way.</p>
<p>The sea was a vast expanse of white, and had lost its spirit of serenity and majestic posture, although the water was still surging against the bottom of the boat. All thirty-odd people on the boat were focused on preventing accidents from happening, because according to the experience of veteran sailors, under such a heavy fog, misfortune could easily befall.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at the moment when half of the sun had just emerged from the water, the searchlight on an ocean liner suddenly broke through a fog wall that was a little more than ten feet thick and shone directly on Xu Changxing's boat. Although the ocean liner was traveling at a very low speed, in less than ten seconds, there was a loud crash, followed by cries and shouts for help. Xu Changxing's large sand boat, which had been sailing in the sea for more than ten years, was rammed into two sections by the ocean liner and completely sank to the bottom of the sea in half a minute. Floating on the surface of the water were only some planks, debris, and a few crew members whose faces could not be seen clearly.</p>
<p>By the afternoon of the next day, except for a dozen or so crew members who were rescued by the ocean liner and taken into port, the rest had been swallowed by the sea god, although their wives were still waiting on the shore, hoping to be rescued by another boat.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Jin Yang)</p>
<p>A person who does not admit their mistakes has no determination to change.</p>
<p>Before you jump, look around you in all directions.</p>
<p>A person who submits a manuscript but doesn't see it published suffers the same pain as an editor who doesn't receive good manuscripts.</p>
<h3>The Smiling Leaf Sweeper</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>In the beautiful scenery of spring flowers and autumn moons, I have never seen such an old and hunched leaf sweeper on this tree-lined path. It wasn't until the second half of October, when the wisteria in front of the window turned into dragon-snake-like skeletons, and I could see the buildings outside the park directly from my room, that I felt that the years were already late in the winter monsoon. As if reluctant to part with the few remaining green leaves on the branches, I put on my clothes and walked to the open space next door. As I was gazing at the blue of the sky, I heard heavy footsteps echoing from the forest. Soon, I saw the old leaf sweeper. In his hand, he held a very large bamboo broom, standing upright almost longer than his bent body. On his long, silver-gray beard that hung down to his chest, I could see that he was already very old. He wore a French velvet hat that someone else had discarded, and a cotton-padded coat was wrapped in a woolen sweater that had lost its buttons. He was already wearing cotton shoes. Old people are more susceptible to cold than young people, but his fingers were still trembling, as if his clothes were not warm enough. I stood with him for a short time and began to talk.</p>
<p>"Old man, when did you start doing this job?" I asked. He didn't answer, but only smiled at me, as if he knew that I was asking with my eyes rather than with my ears. I continued to ask, "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Where is your home?" He only responded with a smile. I went on to ask who was in his home, but he shook his head, indicating that there was no one.</p>
<p>"Then how much money can you earn each day?"</p>
<p>When he heard this question, he seemed a little excited. His silver-gray beard moved, as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he didn't say a word. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy in my heart and said, "Come, wouldn't it be good to rest at my place?"</p>
<p>So, this sentence aroused another smile from him, a bleak smile. He lowered his head, moved his heavy steps, swung the bamboo broom on the yellow leaves on the ground, and his bent body was illuminated by the sun, casting a bent shadow on the yellow leaves. ... He finally did not accept my invitation.</p>
<p>The years are indeed late. I sighed softly.</p>
<p>I went back home. It was dark. In the darkness, I still saw the leaf sweeper's smile.</p>
<h3>Different Worlds</h3>
<h3>Scattered Strings</h3>
<p>— (Ye Qibai)</p>
<p>Along the banks of the Huangpu River, there must be countless workers.</p>
<p>Along the bustling roads, there must be many bums.</p>
<p>Around every tram station, train station, grand hotel, restaurant, and company, there must be many rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>Around every school, there must be many candy stalls.</p>
<p>Along both sides of every alley entrance, there must be tiger stoves and cigarette paper shops, and other shops.</p>
<p>Along the tram stops and other places, there must also be cigarette paper shops.</p>
<h3>Imperial Fragrance Misty Records</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When it was first reincarnated as a fox, it had nine tails, all of them very plump and beautiful... In addition, it could also use a magic of invisibility. In the end, it lost eight tails, but fortunately its precious invisibility magic was still preserved, so it was not completely useless. Originally, its nine tails were actually nine bad habits. Because it had these nine bad habits, it gradually became addicted, day by day falling, becoming a bad element between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>What were the nine bad habits? The first was liking to drink alcohol, often getting drunk; the second was recklessness and carelessness; the third was dishonesty, often lying and cheating; the fourth was greed for money, becoming envious when seeing precious things; the fifth was a quick temper; the sixth was gluttony, often stealing other people's food; the seventh was insatiable greed, wanting two when having one; the eighth was lust, always losing control when seeing beautiful women; the ninth was licentiousness, often indulging in excessive desire. These nine bad habits completely blinded its heart, and it was doing evil almost every day. Later, the Jade Emperor finally found out and was furious. He immediately took it away and severely rebuked it. Finally, he said, "From now on, you must reform and become a good fox! The only way now is to cut off one of your tails?" It was very anxious when it heard this, because it loved all nine of its tails. It didn't know which tail to remove to cause it the least amount of pain. However, the Jade Emperor did not allow it to have a choice and immediately issued an order to cut off the tail that made it like to drink alcohol. He repeatedly warned, "Now I will give you another thousand years to cultivate yourself and change your behavior." (204)</p>
<p>Places Visited</p>
<h3>On the Road in Wuxi and Yixing</h3>
<p>— Huoxue Ming</p>
<p>A desolate autumn rain, dampening the gloomy morning streets. I slipped out quietly from the Second Inn. The rickshaw pullers, seemingly unafraid of the wind and rain, swarmed over, calling out, "Sir, Zhaotouzhu? Oh, Xiaojishan?... Plum Garden?" Their voices had a hint of trembling and a touch of flippancy.</p>
<p>As usual, I shook my head, pulled up my collar, and walked onto the infinitely tranquil and cool Shima Road. Although I yearned for the Shuangdong Caves of Yixing, and thus summoned strong courage, it would not be the traveler's fortune if the rain grew heavier.</p>
<p>"But what's the point of staying in Wuxi city, watching the rain? Even if the rain gets heavier, I still have to go to Yixing." Finally, this is how I strengthened my wavering will.</p>
<p>I ate a bowl of soup noodles at a teahouse opposite the Jiangnan Automobile Company under Tongyun Bridge, bought a round-trip ticket for one yuan and ten cents to the station, boarded the fourth bus, and left the city at exactly seven o'clock. Passing Huangbu Pier in the northwest, so charmingly situated in the middle of the canal, with red walls peeking through the gaps in the weeping willows, and fishing sails flying in the water breeze, I instinctively thought of the Fengzi of the Nanhu Misty Rain Tower. Wasn't there a drizzle in the sky?</p>
<p>Our car darted into Rong Lane, the horn blaring continuously. The roof was almost level with the eaves of the houses on both sides, and the body of the car just barely cleared the steps on both sides. If it turned too fast, or if the pedestrians on the opposite side retreated a little slowly, I think it would be very easy to have a fatal accident here. It's fundamentally unsuitable to have traffic vehicles going back and forth on a small market street, and the street of this market is so narrow; I really can't figure out why the people of Rong Lane don't cherish their lives and oppose it!</p>
<p>In thirty minutes, we arrived at Plum Garden and stopped for a moment. That garden, which would be famous for its "fragrant snow sea" in a hundred more days, could not attract elegant people to tread the snow and seek poetry at this moment, and not even a single mountain bird could be heard in the dense foliage. From Yangwan to Xueyan Bridge, the car leaned against the mountains on the right, winding westward; the silvery light and shadow of Taihu Lake on the left, like flowing mercury, slightly brightened my melancholy eyes. The water hung in the sky, and the sky connected to the water, a vast expanse, without even a trace of light blue boundary that could be distinguished. The mountains in the lake, lying on white satin, embraced several charming snails, those yachts and awning boats, only as black as flies, crawling slowly.</p>
<p>This car is not only left lake and right mountain, but also the twists and turns up and down are severe. Often the car is close to the lake, and it seems that there is no way to go in front, but the peak turns and the path changes, and it immediately drives into the mountains, and the lake surface becomes far and small; not long after, the mountain path unfolds again, still sending the lake waves back. It's like a coiled long dragon, stretching its limbs, coiling down from the top of the mountain, and flying up from the lake. If you have taken the Fuyang Road car, from Fancun to the Liuhe Pagoda section; you will definitely say that the scenery here is very similar. But I think that the mountain colors and lake scenery of Erlongtou, because the Qiantang River is not as good as Taihu Lake, the greatness still belongs here.</p>
<p>West of Panjia Bridge, Taihu Lake left us and was no longer visible.</p>
<p>The mountain colors also lacked the shadows, not as lively and agile as before. But the rain had stopped, the clear clouds released blue, and the sun slowly brightened, shining on the pine forests and rocks densely covered with pearls, especially bright. Distant peaks and near peaks, in turn, poked their heads out from the silvery-gray mist. At the edge of the Heshui station, fishermen on the riverbank were wearing palm cloaks, drying wet nets, and some were holding fishing rods, staring intently as they spied on our car speeding by. It was truly a wonderful poem!</p>
<p>The villagers in the same car were very simple in their clothes. They would politely tell you which family's pottery from Dushan and tea from Mingling were the best; when the Tonghe Bridge traffic car to Changzhou could depart; but if you asked about Gengsang and Shanshan, they would all stare blankly and be unable to answer. The closer people are to the city, the less they have visited the scenery of their local area because of the burden of labor. This may also be due to different interests. Therefore, city people are particularly envious of the life of mountain people, and do not hesitate to travel far to climb peaks and explore caves; while the woodcutters and silkworm farmers, upon seeing the silk carriages and horses of city people, are also so envious!</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I spent the time of viewing the mountains in idle conversation. Suddenly, the passengers in the car became commotioned, all tidying up their luggage; looking up, I found another city moat, embracing the red-roofed station, with large characters clearly marked on the station building, indicating that Yixing had indeed arrived!</p>

<h3>Innes Right Winger Suffers Leg Fracture</h3>
<p>Unfortunate Incident During Friendly Football Match</p>
<p>Youyou Team Wins 5-2</p>
<p>The Youyou football team played a friendly match against Innes yesterday at Shen Garden. Although Youyou won 5-2, an unfortunate incident occurred.

He was taken to the British Army Hospital by emergency ambulance.</p>
<p>Tragic Incident Wu Shouheng was the referee. In the first ten minutes of the game, Innes' offense was strong, pressing repeatedly. Youyou suffered due to the lack of strict midfield defense. However, Innes' forwards lacked accuracy and shot the ball wide of the goal. Otherwise, Youyou would have been in trouble. At about the tenth minute, Innes' right winger Maskersky dribbled the ball from the right. Lu Zhiming rushed to defend. In that instant, the two collided with a crisp sound that could be heard throughout the field. Maskersky fell to the ground. It was clear that his leg bone was broken. An ambulance was called urgently to treat him. Innes was replaced by Xun Jinno. The game was paused for over ten minutes.</p>
<p>Youyou Wins Play continued, and Youyou's defense avoided danger, conceding slightly. In the siege, Innes' Cullen first headed in a goal to open the scoring. Zhong Yongshen retaliated, making it 1-1. Cullen headed in again, giving Innes a 2-1 lead in the first half. In the second half, Youyou's two main defenders, Jiang Wang, entered the game. With a solid defense, they were able to attack at will. The second half was dominated by Youyou. Xi Qiaosheng crossed the ball, and Wang Caigao flicked it in, tying the score. Zhong Yongshen scored again, giving Youyou a 3-2 lead. Sun Jinshun scored, making it 4-2. Finally, Hu Youcheng scored, ending the game 5-2.

<h3>Financial Matters</h3>
<p>Silver Price Falls, Pure Gold Rises</p>
<p>Spot Gold Recovers Two Yuan and Eight Jiao</p>
<p>Many Speculators Closing Positions, Prices Rise Then Fall</p>
<p>Although the gold market recovered yesterday, the overall trend in the first half of the day was not very strong. This was mainly because Finance Minister Kong dispelled rumors of inflation, and many speculators rushed to close their positions. As a result, prices initially rose but then fell. Although there were several rebounds midway, these were due to the efforts of Chinese banks to support foreign exchange, leading to tight domestic markets. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both England and America fell, and forward silver prices also decreased by 0.5 to 0.65 cents. Exchange rates slightly recovered, and London raw gold rose by 2 pence. This naturally boosted confidence, and pre-market trading opened, briefly rising to 0.045. However, due to reports of Finance Minister Kong's refutation of the rumors, speculators took profits and closed positions, and large investors also took the opportunity to sell. This led to an oversupply and a sharp decline, falling below the 1,000 yuan mark. Selling pressure increased, and the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the British pound unchanged and the US dollar rising by 0.0625. Customs gold unit rose by 0.3 cents, and the standard gold price was listed as 1,005 yuan and 8 jiao. Prices stabilized slightly after the initial drop. After a high opening in the morning, prices were immediately pulled up, but suppliers were still active, and the market situation was quite volatile. Nevertheless, the overall trend continued to be positive, with demand exceeding supply. It was anticipated that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would announce exchange rates, with the British pound decreasing by 0.125 and the US dollar decreasing by 0.25. Subsequently, prices rose to the 1,000 yuan mark twice, but were obstructed due to eager supply. The struggle was intense. Then, the Central Bank and other banks vigorously supported the market, leading to a tight domestic market and rising prices. However, breaking through the 1,000 yuan mark proved difficult. Unexpectedly, after the rise was thwarted, a decline ensued. Dealers sold foreign exchange, and the market again showed an oversupply. Large investors supplied slightly, and speculators, already fatigued, suddenly started selling, leading to an immediate decline. However, Chinese banks again supported the market by purchasing exchange bills, and prices stabilized after the drop. Large investors bought at lower prices, while the silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 0.5 cents, levying only 6%. The exchange rate for the British pound, calculated at 1 shilling and 5 pence and 128125, initially rose but then fell back. Soon after, Chinese banks showed strong appetite, and the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and others continued to buy, tightening the exchange market again. Buyers flocked in. Foreign wire reports indicated that the US was not entirely in agreement with granting loans to China. In addition, the Guangdong group continued to purchase aggressively, pushing prices up to the 1,000 yuan mark again. Supply at higher prices has not dissipated and prices are falling back again. The struggle was particularly strong in the middle. Later, when the exchange market stabilized, large investors and buyers waited and watched, and speculators panicked again. Selling activity ensued, so although buyers tried to purchase at lower prices, they could not temporarily raise prices. Due to the disparity between buyers and sellers, the market continued to fall at noon closing, and the swap rate had retreated to a premium of 12.5 yuan for short positions. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 996 yuan and 8 jiao, a recovery of 5 yuan and 9 jiao from the previous closing. Shunmao and others made deliveries, rising to 8 yuan. Dafa Yong and Fuxing Yong sold, falling to 6 yuan. Hengchang Yong, Changda, Yongli, Shunmao, Fuchang, and Hengxingyuan made deliveries, rising to 1,000 yuan. Shenkang and Yuanmaoyong sold, falling back to 997 yuan and 5 jiao. It was anticipated that HSBC would announce exchange rates, with the British pound decreasing by 0.125 and the US dollar decreasing by 0.1875. Wanxing, Yuqingyong, Wanxing, Wanchangyong, and Fuxing joined forces to purchase, and prices rose to 1,000 yuan. As sentiment was not strong, some took profits at higher prices, and Yongli and Yongfeng sold, retreating to 998 yuan and 3 jiao. The overall trend remained relatively stable. As the</p>
<p>Central Bank and the Bank of China supported spot shillings at 4.375 pence, Fuyu, Fuchang, Wanxing and others purchased, and prices rose to 1,000 yuan. However, sentiment was still difficult to boost. Dealers sold exchange bills, and although banks supported the market, it hardened once. Large investors such as Fuxingyong, Qingyu, Dingkang, Hanheng, Yicheng, Tianfengyong, Hengyu, and Yifeng</p>
<p>Yong and others sold, gradually falling to 994 yuan. Hengxingyuan and Qingyu made deliveries at lower prices, rising to 6 yuan. Fuxingyong and Wanxing sold, falling to 4 yuan and 3 jiao. Shanghai supported February US dollars at 25. Hanheng, Yongfeng, Dadecheng and others joined forces to purchase, and Shenkang also came out and bought again, rising to 7 yuan and 5 jiao. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 0.5 cents, and Tianfeng and Renfayong sold, retreating to 5 yuan and 2 jiao. Dalian Duzhaofengchang, Futaiting, Dadecheng, Fuxingyong and others bought, rising to 8 yuan and 4 jiao. Hengxingyuan, Fuyu, and Dingtai sold, falling to 7 yuan. However, Chinese banks</p>
<p>were vigorously supporting foreign exchange, and Guangdu was also supporting shillings. The exchange market remained tight, and the Central Bank and Bank of Communications were also making significant purchases. Shanghai even wanted March shillings at 4 pence but did not get them. Foreign wire reports rumored that the US had not yet approved international loans. Shengshengda and Hengyu competed to purchase, returning to 1,000 yuan. Fuyu, Dingtai, Changda, Xianghe, Yuanheng, and Yuanmaoyong and others continued to supply, making it difficult to rise further, gradually falling to 7 yuan and 4 jiao. At this time, Dadecheng purchased aggressively, once rising to 8 yuan and 7 jiao. Fuxingyong and others continued to sell, and then fell to 6 yuan again. At this time, Dingtai, Xiangfeng, Hanheng, and Dadecheng still had buying interest, while Fuxingyong and Yicheng supplied, hovering around 7 yuan for a long time. After the afternoon, Citibank came out with January US dollars at 0.5 yuan. Sentiment was already weak. Dalian group Yicheng, Zhaofengchang and others came to support, and retail investors sold, falling to 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengyu, Renfayong, and Tongchun made deliveries, but because Yuqingyong was still selling, few transactions were made, struggling around 5 yuan. Then, because Qianchangxiang vigorously bought, it rose to 6 yuan and 2 jiao. Speculators continued to close positions, and the market was difficult to support. Zhaofengchang, Shenkang, Yuli, Tongfu and others sold, and buyers waited and watched, and prices fell to 3 yuan and 4 jiao. By the afternoon closing, it was 993 yuan and 7 jiao. After the close, Qianchangxiang, Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, Fuxingyong and others came to buy, once rising to above 4 yuan. Tongtaichang, Hanheng, and Hengyu supplied again, and retail investors sold again, retreating to within 3 yuan. Shunmao and others made deliveries at lower prices, still able to pull prices up. Finally, because Shengshengda and Dafeng sold, prices finally succumbed to within 3 yuan. The highest price during the first half of the day was 1,000 yuan, and the lowest price was 993 yuan and 4 jiao, a fluctuation of 6 yuan and 6 jiao. As a result, it recovered 2 yuan and 8 jiao from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the Central Bank's standard gold price of 1,005 yuan and 8 jiao. According to the closing price, it was about 12 yuan lower, which was about 1 yuan less lower than the previous closing. The January account was 978 yuan, and the February account was 994 yuan. The morning water supplement was 973 yuan. The price of pure gold was still 12 yuan lower than the futures market, with a listed price of 984 yuan and 8 jiao. There was still a lack of proper matching for spot transactions, and the market situation was stable. The swap premium had become cheap, so the buying price for Tianjin goods had retreated to 8 yuan less than the futures market, and the selling price was 3 yuan less than the futures market. Initially, Qianchangxiang and others were willing to pay a premium, but there was a lack of long positions, leading to a weakening trend. Later, Yicheng paid Futaiheng 266 contracts, only 12.5 yuan. Foreign short-term financing saw an increase again, and the premium became cheaper. The future of swap trading is feared difficult to develop.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was peaceful. In total, Shengshengda, Qianchangxiang, Dachangxiang, Qingfayong, Fuchang, Bingxing, Juchang, Fuyu, Dingtai, Dafa Yong, Hengyu and others were on the buying side. Dadecheng, Tianfengyong, Tongfengheng, Zhaofengchang, Hengchangyong, Fuxingyong, Tongtaichang, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Yongli, Futaiheng, Jingfu and others were on the selling side. Shenkang, Fuxingyong, Futaiheng, Dingtai, and Hanheng initially sold and then bought. Dadecheng, Hengxingyuan, Shunmao, and Zhaofengchang initially bought and then sold. The Dalian group Wanxing traded around 800 contracts in total, netting out more than 100 contracts. Shunli traded more than 500 contracts in total, netting out a slight profit. Guangdu Shengshengda bought more than 300 contracts and sold a few. Hengxing bought and sold very little. The total number of transactions on the day was 41,581 contracts in the morning. The afternoon was a holiday due to Wednesday.</p>
<p>For January contracts, the buyers were Fuchang and Hengyu, each with over 1,000 contracts.</p>
<p>Yongfeng had more than 700 contracts, Qianchangxiang had more than 400, Ruixing and Shunmao had more than 300 each, Yifengyong, Bingxing, Wanxing, Yicheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Hengchangyong had more than 200 each, and Chunyuanyong, Dachangxiang, Tianfeng, Runchangyu, Changshengyong, Daxingyong, and Lifeng had more than 100 each.

There were still 7,420 contracts remaining in total, with 42 long positions and 19 short positions.</p>
<p>The new lineup for the February period is gradually becoming lively. In total, the long positions include Zhengchang with just under 3,300 contracts, Fuyu with just over 1,900, Senchangyong with just over 1,800, Shenkang and Shengshengda with more than 1,600 each, Dachangxiang with just over 1,400, Yuanmaoyong with just under 1,300, Hengxingyi with less than 1,200 each, Fuxingyong with just over 1,000, Bingxing and Changshengyong with more than 800 each, Tongfu, Qingfayong, and Yuandayong with more than 600 each, Zhaofengchang, Juchang, Wanxing, and Yuxinxiang with more than 500 each, Chunyuanyong, Fuchang, and Jiatai with more than 400 each, Yifeng, Yongheng, and Fuxing with more than 300 each, Tianfeng, Hengxingyuan, Dingtai Shunmao, and Jiarun with more than 200 each.

<h3>Fierce Buying by Chinese Banks</h3>
<p>Extremely Tight Exchange Market</p>
<p>According to foreign wire reports, London discounts have decreased sharply recently and in the distance by 0.3125, and the US silver discount has decreased by 0.5 cents.

After the opening, the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the British pound unchanged and the US dollar rising by 0.0625, and the customs gold unit rising by 0.3 cents. Sentiment was flat, and there were few transactions. The trend was stable. HSBC announced its exchange rates, with the British pound decreasing by 0.125 and the US dollar decreasing by 0.1875. Although bank sentiment was good, Chinese banks did not show strength. As a result, the market situation fluctuated, but transactions gradually became lively. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and others successively settled, and the potential was very tight. However, because Chinese banks' appetite was full, there was still a relaxation. The reduction in the silver balance tax by 0.5 cents had little impact, because Chinese banks were very active in settling, and the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and others also purchased. Guangdu in Chinese banks continued to support shillings slightly, and the process tightened again. After that, the gold market was still weak, and bank appetite was slightly stagnant, gradually relaxing. The overall trend was still good. By the time of the year-end near-term selling price, the British pound was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 46875, and the US dollar was 34 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, the British pound was tight by 0.15625 and the US dollar was tight by 0.1875. Chinese banks shorted more than 200,000 US dollars, and a small number of shillings. Foreign banks also shorted. Chinese banks were unanimously shorting, and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Jin City Bank, and others were also shorting foreign exchange very eagerly. The overall trend in the first half of the day was quite tight. The transaction prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Silver Market Increasingly Tight</h3>
<p>Foreign Short-Term Financing Opens at 0.35</p>
<p>"Hua Tou" Opens at 0.38</p>
<p>In recent days, the silver market has become increasingly tight. If this trend continues, the financial sector will inevitably face danger. Yesterday, the market for foreign short-term financing was 0.35, the same in both the morning and afternoon, which was 0.05 higher than the previous day. "Hua Tou" with added water opened at 0.34 in the early trading, and then rose to 0.38, which was also 0.08 higher than the previous day. The trade in discounted bills was instead declining, with a sense of no way to handle it. It is estimated that the morning market had 2.5 million in transfers and 200,000 in new transactions. The afternoon market had 500,000 in transactions, and the small general association had 1.1 million in transactions. The foreign mortgage loan transaction took 700,000 in redemptions and 900,000 in new loans. The Bund bank made 1.4 million in loans. Banks' collections of foreign banks' bill payments were 2.7 million, collections of various goods and foreign exchange mortgages were 4.6 million, telegraphic transfers were 600,000, special foreign exchange transfers were 400,000, foreign exchange settlements were 1.1 million, year-end settlements were 3 million, and warehouse entries were 800,000. Chinese banks' collections of bill payments were 3.0 million, telegraphic transfers were 400,000, year-end settlements were 2.5 million, foreign exchange settlements were 1.4 million, special foreign exchange transfers were 700,000, customs duty payments were 700,000, collections of various foreign exchange goods and mortgages were 3.5 million, and warehouse exits were 400,000. Japanese banks' collections of bill payments were 1.7 million, foreign exchange settlements were 700,000, collections of various foreign exchange goods and mortgages were 3.9 million, year-end settlements were 2.2 million, and warehouse entries were 900,000. Money houses' foreign public orders collected 34 million, "Hua Tou" funds collected 7.6 million, various route remittances collected 700,000, banknotes recovered 1.1 million and issued 600,000, unmarked bills collected 1.3 million and paid out 1.3 million, customer revenue was 300,000, and net revenue was 150,000.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges on the 19th by the Shanghai Clearing House was 8,200,000 yuan, 3,588 yuan, 1 jiao and 7 fen, which included 4,439,664 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen in silver dollars, and 3,763,923 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 fen in remittances.</p>
<h3>Single and Double Coins Perform Differently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins experienced sluggish trading in both the morning and afternoon markets, each falling by 2 yuan and 2 jiao, both at 840 yuan. The trade volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver coins have been rising strongly for several days. The morning market rose by 1 yuan to 762 yuan, and the afternoon market continued to rise by 1 yuan and 5 jiao to 763 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, it rose by 2 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The trade volume was 105,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 300,000 "wen", which was 4,000 "wen" less than the previous day. The transaction amount was 29,400 "chuan wen", equivalent to 9,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Tight Monetary Conditions Make It Difficult for Public Bonds to Rally</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchantile Securities Exchange market once again turned bearish. The so-called rumors of currency devaluation and paper money policies had been swept away. This is because China's financial situation is completely different from that of other countries. In fact, it is absolutely impossible at present. The securities market is overly sensitive, and rumors rise and fall easily. The high price of foreign short-term financing at 0.35 and "Hua Tou" at 0.40 shows that there has been no turnaround in monetary conditions. The financial sector is shorting shillings but not public bonds, causing the market to struggle. The huge amount of short positions previously released was only slightly offset the day before yesterday. Judging by the situation, most of them are preparing to be delivered. However, because the difference between near-term and long-term is too large, speculative trading is still active, so market prices fluctuate erratically. Yesterday, at the opening of the morning session, prices fell across the board due to the high price of foreign short-term financing. Issues 4 and 11, etc., were sold off, and the retail long positions were also poorly managed. Market prices fell sharply by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 1.1 yuan. The second session slightly offset the losses, rising by about 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that "Hua Tou" was trading at 0.40, and sentiment remained weak. Issues 17 and 53 continued to be sold off, and prices fell again by 0.3-0.5 yuan. At the close, issue 16 slightly offset the losses, and there were also temporary transactions to close positions on the trading floor, slightly rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Due to the approaching settlement date, market prices are expected to fluctuate. Yesterday's market prices fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan to 1.1-1.5 yuan. The total trading volume was 21.37 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Sudden Decline in US Silver Stocks</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (18th) the New York stock market was mixed, with the feature being the decline in silver stocks. It was found that silver stocks did not have any special pressure, and the decline was entirely affected by the decline in silver prices in New York, Montreux, and London. The drop in silver prices was due to the rumor that the United States had stopped purchasing due to a large number of sales. At the same time, rumors that China may reduce the fineness of silver dollars, although denied by semi-official sources, also contributed to the decline in silver prices, and the currencies of Shanghai and "Manchukuo" were affected. Also, news from Washington said that Treasury officials were unwilling to discuss reports of the United States stopping silver purchases in London, and reiterated that government silver purchasing activities must be kept extremely secret to avoid a huge storm in the market. According to private estimates, the US silver reserve is still 100 million ounces short of the legal amount. London silver circles believe that the above report is inaccurate, saying that they know that the United States purchased silver today. The bond market was mixed, with a total of 820,000 shares traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Inflation is Active Again</p>
<p>Many Yarn Merchants' Courage Strengthened</p>
<p>Yarn Market's Rising Trend Starts Slightly, Although news agencies and authorities have firmly denied the matter of inflation, anxiety has resurfaced in the market, and rumors are spreading, including talk of Japanese merchants shorting the market. Consequently, buying interest has increased slightly, and yarn sales are still manageable. Under these chaotic circumstances, the yarn market's future lacks certainty.</p>
<p>"Golden Rooster" Recovers to Rise Six, Seven, Eight Jiao. The "Standard Yarn" market opened higher due to various rumors favoring bullish sentiment, leading to a decrease in sellers. On the 17th, Da Feng Company purchased aggressively to cover short positions, buying over two thousand bales, allegedly to cover a certain merchant's short squeeze. The market trended upward, and sentiment tightened. Consequently, prices for all months rose by seven or eight jiao. The afternoon opening was slightly weak, but prices rebounded strongly at the three o'clock closing. Current yarn sales are reportedly still good, with prices for all months only falling by one jiao. Sales included 2,100 bales from Jin Chang, 400 from Jun Chang, 1,250 from Tai Chang, 950 from Chang Feng, 550 from Sheng Yuan, 550 from Geng Feng, 1,250 from Run Kang, 600 from Yong Da, and 600 from Xin Cheng. Purchases included 800 bales from Sui Long, 2,500 from Da Feng, 700 from Geng Feng, 1,700 from Shen Chang, 1,300 from Heng Yi, 500 from Ren Feng, 900 from De Ji, and 1,350 from Tong Feng. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 299,450</p>
<p>Actual Sales Exceed 1,100 Bales. Current yarn sales are still favorable. A total of 1,160 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with prices rising by two and a half jiao. Purchase amounts by group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 320 Zhenjiang 10 Luchuan 10</p>
<p>Xunqing 15 Yunnan 340 Henan 10</p>

<p>Nanjing 5</p>
<p>Cotton Market Recovers and the Situation Turns Bullish. Due to stable U.S. cotton prices, the yarn market has rebounded. Inflation rumors are rife, leading to active buying, and large bullish players are holding onto their acquisitions. Current cotton consumption remains sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Recovers by Three Jiao. The "Standard Cotton" market opened higher, as U.S. cotton prices rose by five points, while Indian cotton fell by 0.25 to 1 rupee. Yarn prices also rose, and buying interest was strong, with many short positions being covered. Prices for all months rose by two to two and a half jiao. The afternoon opening saw a slight dip of five fen due to a slight drop in gold prices at the morning closing. Prices rebounded strongly at the three o'clock closing, with prices for all months rising by five fen to one jiao. Sales included 1,800 dan from Ji Feng, 2,000 dan from Jin Chang, 3,000 dan from Yuan Yi, 1,100 dan from Hong Chang, 2,300 dan from Rui Yuan, 1,800 dan from Tong Xing, 1,400 dan from Sheng Yuan, and 1,400 dan from Yuan Xing Chang.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Drops in Near Term, Rises in Far Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with prices fluctuating by two points. Bullish players in the December contract, having received delivery notices for 900 bales, closed their positions. However, due to limited trading, the market was firm. Traders made slight purchases, while Southern sellers were scarce, and cotton hoarders did not sell. Buyers feared that higher prices would trigger renewed selling and remained cautious. Eventually, local traders covered short positions, pushing prices up by four to seven points for all months, except for December, which rose by two points. Current cotton demand is weak, and the yarn and fabric market is stable and firm. Liverpool reported small trades, with most of the resales being absorbed by Bombay traders and traders. Spot prices rose by five points, while futures prices fluctuated from a decrease of two points to an increase of nine points. English cotton spot prices fell by three points, and futures prices fell by one to two points. Indian cotton prices were weak due to selling by European exporters and speculators. Pingle fell by 0.25 rupee, Omra fell by 1 rupee, and White Raw Creek fell by 0.75 rupee. Original telegram on the left (dated 18th).</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Spot Flour Slightly Drops, Distant Months Weaker</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month generally showed a trend of stable near-term and weak distant-term contracts. As for imported wheat quotes, Chicago was up four fen to one jiao, and Canada was up one and a half jiao. At the opening, the spot month was quite active due to some buying by traders, so the market was stable. For distant months, large bullish players were inactive, and some were closing positions, so sentiment was weak for a time, falling one to two fen compared to the previous day's closing. By the afternoon opening, the spot month remained stable due to trader activity, while the factories continued selling distant months, causing the market situation to rebound slightly, rising more than a fen from the morning. Looking at the future market situation, it depends on the alignment of imported wheat prices; otherwise, it must be held steady. In the end, the spot month was up half a fen, January and February were up two and a half li, March was up seven and a half li, April was up half a fen, and May was up two and a half li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Quiet with a Hint of Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally quiet and weak in the morning and afternoon openings. As for imported wheat quotes, Chicago was up four fen to one jiao, and Canada was up around one and a half jiao. At the opening, trading in each month was still quiet. The spot month, due to the approaching delivery date and limited outstanding contracts, showed no intention of buying back by hedgers, so the situation was quiet with a hint of weakness. Distant months saw little buying, so fluctuations were minimal. This situation is due to the approaching Lunar New Year, and trading between Shanghai and customers has been virtually halted, so there are few major changes expected in the future. In the end, the spot month was down three fen from the previous day, January was down one fen, February was up one fen, and there were no changes in the rest. Spot wheat prices are holding steady due to inactivity from factories.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat market absorbed a large amount of selling, but unless there is an improvement in foreign demand, new purchases may not be sufficient to raise prices.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 16th 17th Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>December 98.75 98.875 Increase 0.125</p>
<p>May 99.00 99.50 Increase 0.50</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Spot Shortage of Coarse Sand White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a shortage of spot coarse sand white sugar, and the customs gold suddenly rose. Therefore, the guild's quotation for spot ordinary 24 coarse sand white sugar was 18.60 yuan, which was not transacted. 18.65 yuan was the price for goods from local merchants with slight transaction and rising by one and half jiao. Re-export goods remained at 5.20 yuan. Ordinary Dutch red eight and nine sugar remained at 14 yuan, and re-export goods remained at 4.90 yuan. Taikoo sugar's "B" mark was 19.40 yuan. Mianbai sugar from the local Zhen Ji and Zhen Yu factories, both numbered one, was 17.70 yuan. Jian Banghao's first batch of newly arrived Zhangdiao Qing sugar had dozens of packages, of which 30 packages were opened, priced at 12.20 yuan. New Chaoqing is expected to arrive today in larger quantities, and the market trend is soft and may need to loosen slightly.</p>
<h3>National Product Trademark</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>It is very difficult to distinguish between national products and non-national products. The most effective way to make it clear at a glance is the trademark. In general, a product that can gain the trust of society depends on the excellence of its manufacture and the low price. However, what makes people remember it forever is the established trademark. The key points of a trademark are: (1) It should be simple and easy to distinguish, so that people can understand it at a glance. (2) It should be popular and easy to understand, so that even women and children can understand it. (3) It should be interesting, so that people do not forget it. It is even more valuable if it can show the advantages of the product and promote the characteristics of national products. In the past, national product manufacturers, in order to cater to customers' preference for foreign goods, often used foreign languages ​​for Chinese national products. This not only lost the dignity of national products, but also made it easier for those who wanted to use national products to be confused, causing a problem of not knowing what to do. At this time when the national patriotic psychology is extremely developed and everyone is happy to use national products, it seems that there is no need to use foreign languages ​​to confuse the people. The characteristics of the product should be announced to the society through trademarks at any time, so that sellers know what to choose and users know what to ask. Factories in Europe, America and Japan hold competitions and exhibitions every month. Therefore, when people in their countries adopt goods, they have a clear idea in their minds and do not have to ask questions. There is the convenience of designation, and the development of national products has a long history. Manufacturers in our country are confused by short-term benefits and spare small expenses. They do not pay attention to the promotion of such trademarks, nor do they pay attention to the display of goods. They even use sub-brands and inferior goods to lower their credibility. This is a huge hidden reef for the future of national products. Recently, the Women's National Product Year Movement Committee held a national product trademark exhibition, collecting trademarks from various factories for public display, so that those who like to use certain products can strengthen their beliefs. The meaning is profound and valuable. It is deeply hoped that all national product manufacturers will pay more attention to the use of trademarks in the future, in order to maintain the dignity of their products, and to improve their products and reduce costs to be welcomed by the society. This is what the reporter sincerely hopes.</p>
<p>National Product Talk</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Student National Product Year</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>This year's Women's National Product Year is about to</p>
<p>separate from us! Next year will be designated as the "Student National Product Year." What a "Student National Product Year!" Although I have been away from student life for a long time, I absolutely agree with it. I think: all the young compatriots who are studying must be very happy and express 120,000 points of agreement when they hear this news.</p>
<p>As the Student National Product Year is coming, I dare to, as a youth, make an earnest request to the generally respectable and lovable student comrades, what kind of request? Please listen to me:</p>
<p>(1) It is hoped that students will make a decision to use national products from now on: Students are the pillars of the country, the center of society, and the saviors of the nation. Of course, it is hoped that students will bear the responsibility of saving the country and the nation. It is also hoped that students will work hard to promote national products. If 80% of the students in the country can faithfully use national products and promote national products, and at the same time, recognize the use of foreign products as the greatest shame in life, then China's national product movement will definitely get a lot of help, unlimited promotion, and great achievements. Therefore, I very much hope that all young students in China will swear to use national products and promote national products from now on, so that the national product movement can achieve extraordinary results under the efforts of students, show that the spirit of the students is extraordinary, and at the same time, it can also correct the general perception that students are foreign product promoters.</p>
<p>(2) It is hoped that students can organize small groups for using national products, so as to achieve mutual supervision: I very much hope that when the Student National Product Year begins, students in each school will start to form small groups for using national products, whether it is a group of five people or a group of ten people, ask teachers to be instructors, and the group should formulate methods for using national products, publicizing the principles of national products, and supervising each other and encouraging efforts. Now, we can start preparing immediately and start forming the groups on New Year's Day. I think: This is also a very meaningful job.</p>
<p>(3) It is hoped that teachers will often encourage students: The quality of all students' achievements is closely related to teachers. Similarly, if we want the Student National Product Year to be effective, teachers must also take the responsibility of encouraging students. Although I do not study education, I know very well that students like to be rewarded by their teachers. Teachers should use this psychology to encourage students to use national products. The school may also organize a "Committee for Rewarding Students for Using National Products" to preside over this work. This is a very valuable and meaningful work. All schools in the country can try it out, which is closely related to the country and the nation.</p>
<p>The above three are what I hope for the upcoming Student National Product Year. I don't know if it can arouse the sympathy of all the young student comrades and teachers?</p>
<h3>Talk About Commercial Competition</h3>
<p>— Yang Chonggao</p>
<p>The rapid influx of foreign goods and the increasing number of foreign merchants</p>
<p>, Chinese merchants should wake up suddenly. In this era of "competition is the life of commerce," merchants in this situation must have the intelligence of competition, understand the psychology of competition, and know how to use the skills of competition. Only in this way can business prosper and avoid decline and elimination.</p>
<p>It is impossible for us to give a formula for competition, and it is even more impossible for us to use "competition is the life of commerce" to solve all commercial problems. We must understand that competition can make commercial life grow and also make commercial life die. This depends entirely on whether the application of competition is proper in the development of commerce.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the panic of social economy and the recession of all businesses, the path taken by the Chinese business community has gone downhill, and it can be said that it has completely gone astray. Everyone does not seek salvation through proper methods to solve the current crisis, but is only seeking temporary peace by playing with deceptive means. However, magic lanterns are always easy to see through, and at that time, we will be at the end of our rope.</p>
<p>The business community must know that competitors should compete with each other within their capabilities under the principle of the system to be reasonable and to seek excellence. We must also have the spirit of honesty丨丨"designated prices" and "genuine goods at fair prices"丨丨scientific minds and artistic selection are also indispensable.</p>
<p>If you want to rely on cunning "big sales," "full size plus three," "willing to lose money big sale" ... to use deceptive and false means to compete, then you can say without hesitation, "the dead end is right in front of you."</p>
<p>It is hoped that the business community will embark on the path of honest competition from now on, broaden their horizons, and first enrich their lineup丨丨do their best to promote national products and supervise the manufacturers' products丨丨compete rationally and profitably in the big market, and express their proper competition.</p>
<p>National Product Discussion</p>
<h3>A Review of Opening Up Foreign Markets</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>This may be my extravagant hope. In such a precarious future for national products, when the general production industry is clamoring about weak sales, stockpiling of inventory, and the difficulty of resisting imported goods and revitalizing national products, I actually want to go a step further and raise the issue of "exploring foreign market research." "Fool's dream" seems to be an impossible thing, but on closer inspection, it is not entirely so. This is precisely our good opportunity. Assuming that we can strive to move forward in the spirit of "selling one more point of national products is to increase the country's vitality by one point" and formulate a strict and precise plan, then it will always gradually approach our hopes and ideals.</p>
<p>We know that in the past and present, there are many overseas compatriots who are very eager for the motherland and demand national products. Song, the Consul General in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, and Mr. Huang Manshi, the representative of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, both came to Shanghai this time, and both of them sincerely expressed their hope for the national product industry in our country. Therefore, our participation in the Philippine Carnival and the preparation for the large-scale Singapore National Exhibition have indeed become the first steps in promoting national products overseas recently. However, in addition to striving to fulfill this pioneering task, I feel that there are several fundamental problems that need to be urgently resolved and implemented. Now, I will put forward the three most worthy of discussion:</p>
<p>(1) Improvement of export goods and promotion of new export goods. In this era of fierce global industrial competition, the first element for us to develop international trade is, of course, to improve old products, and to widely observe the needs of various countries, and to promote a wide variety of new export goods, so as to improve technology, refine products, reduce manufacturing costs, and reduce prices, making them easy to promote.</p>
<p>(2) Tax-free exports and controlled export trade. The high tariff barriers built by various countries at present are indeed a major problem for the export of national products. Therefore, the first step we need at present should be tax-free exports from the government, and then we can contact the government to jointly establish a large-scale export trading company to comprehensively manage the export goods of our country and add reasonable control. We will determine the business principles at any time with specific plans and seek to open up foreign markets as a whole.</p>
<p>(3) Various technical issues during export. Like how to package export goods, the procedures for shipping and bank mortgage, the budget for exchange rate abuses, the preparation of product samples, advertising and sales methods, we have rarely studied these many technical issues during export in the past, so we must first consider them now before we can easily start.</p>
<p>In addition, we should also know that the current government also has this new tendency. The International Trade Bureau is also convening manufacturers of national products from various countries to discuss ways to help promote sales, and it is also the time when Japanese goods are encountering obstacles everywhere. Therefore, this is a good opportunity given to us by nature, and we must take the opportunity to work hard and never miss it!</p>

<h3>National Product Trademark Sample Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Women's National Product Year Movement Committee of this city, in view of the imminent end of the Women's National Product Year, specially held a National Product Trademark Sample Exhibition at the Dacheng Hall of the People's Education Hall on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. To promote national development, we must first enable the general public to recognize national products, so that they will not be deceived by unscrupulous merchants and mistakenly purchase foreign goods when purchasing goods. In the past, various national product exhibitions have focused on the product aspect and did not pay much attention to trademarks. As a result, there have been many cases where compatriots who love to use national products, after purchasing and using them once, want to purchase the product a second time, but cannot repurchase it because they forget the trademark. Therefore, this time, the trademark and the sample are listed at the same time, so that visitors can easily remember them. The method is good and the meaning is beautiful and worthy of learning. The next day, the newspapers were limited in space and only published a general situation. Therefore, I will not hesitate to record the details that were not detailed in the newspapers as follows: The exhibition period is from December 14th to 16th, a total of three days. Choucheng went there at 10:00 am on the first morning and saw the Party and National flags intersecting in the shape of a transaction under the plaque of the "Sacrificial Confucius Instrument Display Office", and a white cloth banner with the words "National Product Trademark Sample Exhibition Display Office" was hung on the facade. He met Mr. Ni Baiyan, an officer of the association, who led him to visit the exhibition. He spoke very modestly, saying that the decision to display the trademark and the sample in the same place this time was to make it easier for visitors to identify and remember. The types of exhibits were stipulated in advance, and each factory designed its own products and brought products with its own trademark, marking the price, brand name, raw material composition and usage instructions, etc., to the meeting for registration, and then arranged them in order, designated the location, and sent personnel to the venue to arrange them by themselves to show fairness. The pillars were covered with slogans such as "Sir, look at their family. Aren't they all using national products?" and "If it's not a national product, the more gorgeous it is, the more shameful it is." In front of the Confucius shrine, long tables were built with wooden boards, covered with tablecloths, and the trademark samples were displayed in a designated position, competing for beauty, all using artistic methods to attract people. For example, the China National Products Company embroidered its trademark on a light yellow plain satin that was a foot and a half wide and three feet long, with tassels hanging down, and hung it high above the glass cabinet of the ritual instrument. It was the most eye-catching thing when you entered the door. The small steel piano it produced on the table was only a foot square. When pressed, it made a clang sound, with ups and downs, and it was just like a piano. Next to the electric fan of the Yabuer Electric Appliance Factory, there was a square plate with various light bulbs inserted on it, which could be used to test the height of the power and the size of the light. It was sometimes bright and sometimes dark, and everyone paid attention to it. In addition to drawing a green water and white goose backdrop and hanging it high under the vermilion plaque of "Sacred God Tianzong," the Wuhe Weaving Factory also put the goose brand cotton wool shirts and health shirts it produced on wooden racks, arranged in order according to their size. From a distance, it was like a horizontal team formed by elementary school students during gymnastics. In addition to displaying various candies, the Guanshengyuan also placed the "Life" trademark on the top of the cabinet, and enlarged the photo of Ms. Ren Xiuqun, a patriotic female student who likes to eat butter toffee, and placed it next to the table, holding a bag of candy with a sweet and innocent smile, which was very lifelike. Female students stopped and looked at it carefully and were reluctant to leave, causing the viewers to be like walls. Other examples include the various silk samples of the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, which were colorful, and the electric wood and electric jade appliances of the Ya Guang Manufacturing Company, which were smooth, clean and beautiful. I can't list them all in detail. In short, various goods are no less than the same imported goods. I hope that all of you who visit the exhibition will remember the trademarks and purchase them for trial use, so as not to fail the intention of the association in holding this exhibition.</p>

<h3>Santa Claus's Gift</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The revolving years have once again turned to winter. The cold wind is blowing fiercely, causing people to shrink their necks and put their hands in their sleeves; causing the trees to be bald and bare; causing the sun to be dim and unable to emit its usual majesty; causing the sky to be covered with dark clouds, as if brewing for snow. Blowing and blowing, bringing a foreign festival, Christmas, 丨a foreign winter solstice丨.</p>
<p>Huang Dafang, that little child, is only eleven years old, has already finished primary school, and is now in the first grade of senior primary school. His parents are Christians, so on the night before Christmas, they buy some expensive gifts for him. They don't let Dafang know beforehand. While he is fast asleep that night, they put the things in a large stocking. Edibles like chocolate candies, coffee candies, milk candies; toys like foreign dolls, small cars, small airplanes, everything is available. They hang this stocking on top of Dafang's bed. When Dafang wakes up, his eyes still drowsy, he sees this bag of gifts. He jumps up with joy, holding the bag of gifts, deliberately asking, "Who gave me this lovely gift?" His mother replies, "Santa Claus." Dafang asks again, "What kind of person is Santa Claus?" His mother says again, "He is an old man wearing a large robe, a pointed hat, and snow-white hair." Dafang says again, "Mom! When this old man came, why didn't he wake me up and let me see his face; and personally thank him!" His mother chuckles and says, "There's no need for you to thank him. We have already thanked him for you!" Year after year, Dafang also knows that this is a trick of his parents, but he doesn't expose it, in order to please his parents. These few days, Dafang knows that his parents are preparing his Christmas gifts again, so he says to his parents, "These two years are the years of national products. What we eat, wear, and use should all be national products. Even the toys we children play with should also be national products. The teacher at school also told us: This year, because there are many unpatriotic children who do not use national products, just the import of toys alone has already amounted to several hundred thousand yuan. In this way, we children also have a share of the responsibility for China's poverty! Moreover, next year is designated as the Student National Products Year. I am a member of the primary school students. If I still play with imported toys and eat imported candies, it will not only be a loss of the personality of a dignified Chinese citizen; but also a black sheep, punishable by everyone丨So this year, if Santa Claus sends me national product gifts, I will not only thank him for his kindness; but also treat it as a souvenir of sincere use of national products. If he still sends me the previous imported goods, I will throw this thing in the trash can!" His parents nodded repeatedly upon hearing these words, praising him for his true ambition.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Christmas Eve arrived, and Dafang still slept peacefully in his bed, just like last year. Tomorrow he will wake up, and a bag of gifts will be next to him. He opens it and sees a set of student attire, produced by the Sanyou Industrial Company; and many candies, all produced by Guanshengyuan and Taifeng Companies. He is extremely happy to see them. Below many things, there is also a card attached, with a few lines written on it: "These national product gifts are for my patriotic</p>
<p>student Huang Dafang, from a patriotic Santa Claus."</p>

<h3>My Views on "The Relationship Between Work and Life"</h3>
<p>— Xian He</p>
<p>The relationship between work and life is very close, which is almost a universally acknowledged fact. However, a few days ago, Mr. Zhou Yuying put forward three points of view to express his opposition, and his arguments are worthy of high discussion. Therefore, I also briefly write down a few points to ask Mr. Zhou for correction.</p>
<p>The first point is that Mr. Zhou puts forward the importance of "imagination." He said, "Imagination constitutes the substance of literature, and develops passionate emotions丨through certain thoughts and feelings." He also said, "Imagination only has the distinction between profound, smooth, and superficial, bad, and there is absolutely no distinction between substantial or insubstantial life." It can be seen that Mr. Zhou opposes the need for a substantial life, and the impact of a substantial life on imagination. If according to this statement, then a writer only needs to have a strong imagination, and he can sit in the "pavilion or mansion" to write, because imagination will develop passionate emotions, and literature is "after all a discipline centered on emotion," isn't this very convenient? But is it really that simple in reality? No matter how rich the imagination of a writer is, if there is no experience of real life, then what kind of tricks can he imagine out of thin air in his empty head? Mr. Zhou said on the one hand, "However, imagination cannot be separated from the general reality of life," but on the other hand, he denied the close relationship between substantial or insubstantial life and profound or insubstantial imagination, which is really incomprehensible. The poems of Homer and the novels of Tolstoy are only the crystallization of their imagination, or are they reflections of the social life of their time, which can be verified by historical facts. As for Mr. Zhou's belief that "the element of thought was added to literature only with the emergence of modern progressive literature," as if all previous works were just a chaotic mass of emotions, abstract and irrelevant, is this really the case? Are the writers before the so-called "modern times" just some simple little kids who have nothing to do, only know joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, only know how to wipe their noses and shed tears?</p>
<p>In the second paragraph, Mr. Zhou cited many writers from China and abroad. He said that the works of Mao Dun and Ye Shaojun are not entirely records of private life, which is very correct. However, Mr. Zhou sometimes interprets "actual life" only as narrow "private life," and sometimes separates them mechanically, which is an incorrect view. Because man is a social animal, his social relations are very complex. In addition to his own direct experience, there is also a broader, larger-scale "general life." The so-called "experiencing life" does not necessarily mean "private life experienced personally," but the so-called "substantial life" precisely requires a writer to have life knowledge in all aspects, thorough and complete life knowledge. A writer must liberate himself from the narrow circle of private life and broaden his horizons. He must be good at observing all kinds of life, and he must have a clear understanding of the themes he chooses. To mechanically understand "direct life experience" is easy to mislead people. In fact, it is impossible to directly experience everything personally. However, the life that has been personally experienced can be written more intimately and movingly, which is always the truth. Even the "observation" I am talking about is by no means an abstract method. Mr. Zhou does not understand from these aspects, but abandons the social environment in which the writer is located, all social relations, and does not base on a historical point of view, and asks Balzac, who is not "modern," and not an artistic ability to describe other kinds of stories, "like Sinclair's depiction of the destruction of an oil tycoon, the misery of coal mines and slaughterhouses," which is indeed as Mr. Zhou himself said: "I'm afraid it's an unreasonable request"?</p>
<p>As for the third point, Mr. Zhou's emphasis is still on "imagination." However, he himself also said: "...forced to imagine social affairs in the pavilion or mansion, people with strong imagination can write a little bit of something that seems to be true, and people with naive imagination can only foolishly say crazy things, and completely lose authenticity," which shows the unreliability of "imagination." If a writer wants to strengthen his "imagination," so that his "imagination" does not become a vague "fantasy," so that his works can only reach the realm of "seeming to be true," or even completely lose authenticity, then he must 丨again borrowing Mr. Zhou's own words丨 not be separated from the general reality of life. In other words, he must bravely and actively "participate in life," "experience life," and "enrich life." Therefore, Mr. Zhou's "dissent" did not cancel the importance of "substantial life" for "profound thinking," but instead strengthened the meaning. However, when drawing conclusions, Mr. Zhou made a strange turn, abstractly putting forward the "question of the writer's ability," saying that the success or failure of a work depends entirely on the writer's ability. I do not oppose the writer's "ability," but ability is not some mysterious magic weapon, and it can never be put forward in this way out of thin air, let alone reverse cause and effect, and give it an absolute and decisive meaning. Mr. Zhou also seems to oppose those myopic writers who only write about trivial matters around them, saying that their writing method is "opportunistic," which is also true, but I have already said that we must never think that grasping a little bit of fragmentary experience 丨 personal private life, is considered "substantial" and "experiencing." We cannot overlook the difference between "experiencing" and "experience."</p>
<p>In short, I think the "theory of writer's ability" is untenable. If we talk about abstract and mysterious "ability" divorced from real life, then it is inevitable to be empty talk.</p>
<h3>"The Disease of Worldliness"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shiji</p>
<p>Liu Rongqi praised Wang Mojie's poems, saying that they had no "disease of worldliness." The disease of worldliness he pointed out is: "Relying on talent and learning, making an identity, and being good at climbing." I think these three items can also be used to criticize the general situation of today's literary and artistic circles, although the morbid state of the disease of worldliness is definitely not limited to this.</p>
<p>Relying on talent and learning was originally a title that many people hoped to win, because having talent to rely on and having learning to display, how proud it should be! As the trend spreads, all those with a little cleverness show off their faces of talented scholars. In today's literary and artistic circles, if we find one or two better productions, or one or two more insightful and refreshing arguments, then we can see the author promote his great principles of what Ism, and then look down with haughty eyes, as if he has ascended the sandalwood niche. The affected madness of that state is as尊大的 as the wandering knights who have traveled all over the Three Mountains and Five Mountains. However, the technique of subconsciously pursuing this head weighing is not very simple. For example, if I want to stand out, I can deliberately make eccentric views to shock the world; I can also hold one thing, one object, or one person as an enemy and vigorously destroy its actual achievements; I can also create something out of nothing and create some bold and satisfying anecdotes for myself. I can also use sweet words to confuse the public, saying that this place "encompasses everything and has everything." These are all able to directly or indirectly show one's talent and erudition.</p>
<p>Writing here, I think it is worthwhile to consider whether "talent" exists in today's world; but we can say that perhaps the level of physiological aptitude is what is called talent, and the ugly state of those heroes who have meager talent and want to display their learning naturally cannot avoid the criticism of small feet and large shoes.</p>
<p>If the decoration of talent and learning can be exaggerated and used as the purpose of some people, then "making an identity" is one of the means to achieve this purpose. The impact of identity on my way of being a person is so great that there are examples everywhere that can be picked up. The solemn and moral appearance of the gentry class is the identity they pride themselves on; the petty and vulgar appearance of the common people is the identity assigned to them by those above. Such identities are permanently established! The gap between them in terms of nobility and inferiority; and what is the identity of talented scholars! There are many categories of talented scholars, so their identities are also different. Under the myriad of states, they generally strive to dress up according to each person's desires, just like acting. Those who play pure roles must paint Zhu Moqi, those who play dan roles must apply powder and grease, those who play the King of Chu must have a leopard jaw and tiger whiskers, and those who play the Prime Minister of Han must wear a lun towel and feather fan, otherwise they will not be consistent with the role they play. Accordingly, "romantic," "elegant," "crazy," and "sick" are used to the greatest extent and become the best tools for our talented scholars to soar.</p>
<p>"Being good at climbing" is complementary to making an identity. Although someone has broken through "my friend ××," "our predecessor Yuan Hongdao" has still not been heard. To have an identity, you must climb to consolidate your foundation and increase your crown. The reason is obvious, why bother, but what is surprising is the awkwardness of the reverse in words and deeds.</p>
<p>This article is just the leftovers of Qi, making unnecessary annotations, which is also ultimately caused by the psychology of climbing.</p>
<h3>Cowpox and Anesthesia (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Feng</p>
<p>Equally famous in the history of science and medicine, and even more similar to cowpox in terms of the benefits of life, is the discovery of anesthesia. The more developed the nervous system of an animal, the more afraid it is of pain. Although the power to fear and endure pain will vary due to individual physique, customs, and ideas, there is no doubt that humans are the most afraid of pain. Before anesthesia was discovered, major surgery could not be performed, and even opening a boil would cause the patient great pain. Now with anesthesia, very serious surgeries can be treated.</p>
<p>The discovery of anesthesia is commonly attributed to Morton, a dentist in Boston, USA, in 1846. However, tracing its history is very ancient. Europe had occasionally used anesthesia in ancient times: sometimes hemp and sometimes mandrake. Italy in the thirteenth century used a kind of mandragora as an anesthetic. The Polish King Augustus also used anesthesia when performing surgery in 1782, but in ancient times, it was sometimes used and sometimes not. Its widespread use like today was after Morton's discovery.</p>
<p>Before this, in 1787, Sir Humphry Davy, experimented on himself, inhaling the gaseous compound called "laughing gas." Although he did not inhale it to the point of losing consciousness, he believed that laughing gas could be used as an anesthetic and could be used for surgical operations.</p>
<p>In 1818, another celebrity, Faraday, said that the gas of ether could anesthetize people. Later, several doctors in the United States also said so, but it was not widely adopted.</p>
<p>After several years, in 1844, Wells, a dentist from Connecticut, USA, used laughing gas to extract teeth, but the result was not very successful. His courage disappeared and he did not try again. He wanted to use ether instead and tried it himself, but he felt uncomfortable and gave up.</p>
<p>Although Wells' experiment failed, he told the dentist Morton in Boston about this. Morton was very enthusiastic about this matter and felt that ether was better than laughing gas, so he used ether to experiment. He not only experimented with animals, but also experimented with tooth extraction. The results of his experiment convinced him that ether could be used as a good anesthetic. In 1846, he told the surgeon Warren in Boston about this and asked for the opportunity to test his discovery when the opportunity arose. So, in the Massachusetts General Hospital, ether was used as an anesthetic to remove a tumor on a patient's neck, and the result was very good. Since then, the use of ether as an anesthetic has gradually become popular.</p>
<p>The discovery that ether can be used as an anesthetic was actually not only Morton. At about the same time, the chemist Jackson in Boston also discovered that ether could be used as an anesthetic. And Dr. C. Long, a doctor in a small town in Georgia, used ether as an anesthetic in the spring of 1842 and also removed a tumor on a patient's head, and continued to apply it afterwards. Only because Morton's experiment was known the most and spread more widely, therefore, when it comes to the discovery of anesthesia, his name is often mentioned.</p>
<p>After the discovery that ether could be used as an anesthetic was published, Sir James Simpson, a surgeon in Scotland, knew that someone in France had used chloroform as an anesthetic when experimenting with animals, so he took it to experiment and found that the results of chloroform used in surgical operations were good. So, in addition to ether, chloroform was added as another anesthetic.</p>
<p>There are many other discoveries that are beneficial to life. I have only said a little bit here. Future people will progress and no longer waste their efforts on opium, playing cards, and various gambling games, nor will they waste their energy on "fighting for land" and plundering money, and no longer think about ways to kill people with blood-red eyes; transferring the power used in useless and harmful aspects to various explorations and inventions will definitely be able to discover many things and methods that are extremely beneficial to life. This is a matter of course. (The End)</p>
<h3>Give Life a Kick</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Gu Xi's article "Give Life a Slap in the Face," I felt very sympathetic, and I also felt that it should be given a good kick.</p>
<p>Yes, to life, we "should take a tough attitude," 丨"as if we are not just slapping it in the face!" Because丨</p>
<p>This era is an era of suffering, an era of struggle. Living in this era, we should have a rising spirit to deal with our lives.</p>
<p>We not only need to have the burning emotions of a prairie fire, but also to experience, suffer, train, and build in our lives.</p>
<p>The national crisis is approaching us step by step. Who is willing to crawl under shackles, who will always be a slave?</p>
<p>However, who is willing to be a slave?</p>
<p>The raging tide of the times is roaring. We must advance with this turbulent wave.</p>
<p>Perhaps this huge tide will engulf us.</p>
<p>Perhaps this huge tide will crush us.</p>
<p>Perhaps this huge tide will wash us up to the high peaks of the mountains and the distant corners of the earth.</p>
<p>Perhaps this huge tide will surge us to a land of freedom and glory!</p>
<p>However, no matter what, in this era, from a personal point of view, we are just a tiny bubble in the huge tide, a speck of dust in the universe. However, from a general point of view, we gather together, and this is a majestic giant!</p>
<p>At this moment, everything around us is not full of ugliness, cruelty, disasters, troubles, darkness, poverty, hunger...?</p>
<p>What else can we miss?</p>
<p>We should take responsibility.</p>
<p>Although the road is rugged, steep, distant, and difficult.</p>
<p>But there will always be a time to reach it!</p>
<h3>The Slave of Cosmetics</h3>
<h3>Tomorrow (2) (10) (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by (Joseph Conrad), translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>"Stop," she cried loudly. "Don't go away."</p>
<p>Her head was lowered, and she listened attentively. She could not distinguish whether it was the fierce attack of the wind, or whether it was his fateful footsteps that were hurting her heart. Soon all sounds became inaudible. She also seemed to turn into a stone person. This deep, heavy, silent fear came to her heart丨丨more terrible than the fear of death. She raised her gradually disappearing strength for the final cry:</p>
<p>"Harry!"</p>
<p>Even the echo of the diminishing footsteps was gone. Everything was gone. The surging of the waves, the sound of the ever-flowing sea itself also seemed to stop. There was no sound丨丨-no sign of life, as if she were alone, lost alone in that stony place she had heard of, where those madmen went to seek gold and abandon their gold mines.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd, in his dark room, had been paying attention. A window was opened again; in the silent air of this seemingly stony place, a voice echoed above her, high in the dark air丨丨the voice of crazy lies and despair-but also the voice of perpetual hope: "Is he gone丨that informer? Did you hear him say anything, my dear?"</p>
<p>She suddenly burst into tears. "No! No! No! I won't listen to him anymore," she sobbed.</p>
<p>He began to laugh triumphantly. "Did you scare him away? Good girl. Now we will be as before. Don't be impatient, my dear. Wait one more day."</p>
<p>In another cottage, old Carvil sat in a circle chair placed next to a spherical lamp on a near table, turning it very proudly, and shouted loudly to her in a fierce voice: "Bethan! Bethan! You, Bethan!"</p>
<p>Finally, she heard it, and as if controlled by fate, she began to silently walk towards her gloomy little hell-like room. This hell had no high doorposts, no terrible inscriptions deprived of hope - and she did not know what crime she had committed.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd gradually fell into a state of mad joy above.</p>
<p>"Roll in! Don't make noise!" She rebuked him from the door below with tears on her face.</p>
<p>Because he thought that "something was wrong" before, and finally he was relieved, he was very happy, so he did not listen to her command. In this way, the old man's cry of forever believing in "tomorrow" seemed as if all the hopeful fantasies in the world had erupted and brought terror to her heart. (The End)</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Raising a Fat Son</h3>
<p>— BORED</p>
<p>On the 16th, a telegram from Santa Monica, USA: "Screen goddess Clara Bow gave birth to a child in a local hospital today, weighing eight pounds. Her husband, Rex Bell, is also a screen star." Since she is a married woman, it is natural for her to give birth. Therefore, giving birth is originally a very ordinary thing. Now, the American female star Clara Bow has given birth to a big, fat son, which is worth such attention from newspaper reporters, sending telegrams to publicize it. "Isn't this going too far?"</p>
<p>"When men and women unite, all things are created." This is the natural principle of creation. Even in the United States, the number of small citizens born every day is countless, most of which are unheard of. However, special attention is paid to the birth of a small star, almost equivalent to the president giving birth to a small president, or the crown prince giving birth to a small prince. From this, we can see the worship of celebrities by beauties.</p>
<p>In our country, a Jiangbei woman, carrying a basket in one hand and a stick in the other, begs from door to door, singing her "Lotus Fall." Suddenly, she feels a burst of pain and discomfort in her stomach. She gives birth to a small beggar by the corner of someone's wall. She wraps him up herself, holding him by her side, unnoticed by anyone. Soon after, she continues to beg from door to door. This is also the birth of a big, fat son.</p>
<p>There are also the "big bosses" and "small bosses" who, no one knows which concubine number, suddenly "have the joy of a son" or "get a son on the first try." Therefore, they send out invitations widely, treat their guests lavishly, holding what kind of Tangbing feasts or Zuipan banquets. Distinguished guests fill the seats, and the sounds of congratulations overflow the house. The relatives and friends inevitably spend a lot of money, offering gifts, goldware, silk, each according to the thickness of their affection and what they can afford. It is truly a grievance and a waste.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Don't look at a child's birth, only look at the harvest in old age." Because the length of life is unpredictable, and death and longevity are even more uncertain. Moreover, the big, fat son born, will he be an important person in the future? A thief? A heroic soldier? A headline-grabbing star? Or a beggar begging from door to door? It is difficult to predict. In this way, what is the value of a big, fat son after all? When he is first born, how can we predict his future results? Then, celebrating his birth is absolutely meaningless.</p>
<p>Currently, in our country, the economy is declining, the rural areas are bankrupt, commerce is withering, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. It is difficult to maintain one's own life, and it is even more difficult to bear the burden of children. Therefore, there are many who raise children but do not keep them, or who raise them and send them to orphanages. In this case, is giving birth to a child really something to celebrate? Or something to mourn? It is still unknowable.</p>
<p>Once children are born, they must be educated. If they are not educated, they will either become beggars or bad elements of society. In our country, the number of people who can receive higher education is already small. Not only higher education, but even the cost of education for an ordinary junior or senior high school graduate is considerable. If the authorities do not pay attention to such aristocratic education and let "school bosses" raise prices, I am afraid that in the future, not only will there be no one who can receive higher education, but it will also be quite difficult to receive lower education. In this way, the quality of citizens will be even more uneven, and the national culture will decline day by day. Giving birth to sons and raising daughters is the most worrying thing in life. Alas!</p>

<h3>Exile</h3>
<p>— YEFI</p>
<p>It was an early winter evening. The electric lights in the station were brightly lit, and the noisy voices filled the entire station. All kinds of people were constantly moving around. Porters were busy grabbing luggage from passengers, and many vendors were stretching their voices to sell things. Several patrolmen and soldiers, each holding a whip, were patrolling back and forth inside and outside the station. In front of the fourth-class ticket window, a large group of not-so-pretty people were crowding; only a bunch of heads could be seen fluctuating under the intense electric light, a scene reminiscent of the starving masses in front of a soup kitchen.</p>
<p>The girlfriend also squeezed up, and with great difficulty, bought two and a half fourth-class tickets to Shanghai. He clutched the tickets, carrying a bag, shouldering a bedding roll. His wife also carried a basket of miscellaneous items, holding their son, Agou, and walked towards the ticket inspection point. But the ticket inspector insisted on making things difficult for them, saying that such a large bedding roll could not be brought onto the train. After his repeated pleas, they were finally allowed to pass. Passing through an underpass to the opposite platform, there were so many fourth-class passengers, but they were all like them, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing from their disaster-stricken hometown.</p>
<p>This was an 8:07 slow train for third and fourth class, but now it was almost 9 o'clock, and the train had not yet arrived. People were getting noisy, and Agou was clamoring for dinner. Although his mother and father were also really hungry, they had only drunk a bowl of thin porridge and eaten a few sweet potatoes when they left home in the morning. They hadn't even had cold water since then, so their stomachs were naturally rumbling uncomfortably. But where could they find dinner now? Listening to other children crying and clamoring in the same way.</p>
<p>"Agou, be good, don't make noise. We'll go to Shanghai to eat noodles, don't cry!" Agou's mother coaxed him painfully. When he heard about eating noodles, he put a dirty hand into his little mouth and sucked on it, a glimmer of hopeful smile on his thin face. But after a while, he seemed to feel disappointed again, and the thought of not having a broken thatched home emerged from his small heart.</p>
<p>"Mom! Why don't we go back? Go home to sleep!" he cried to his mother.</p>
<p>Caiyou was thinking about the home that had been attacked by natural and man-made disasters, and he couldn't help but feel some moisture in his eyes. Looking at his wife, looking at the ignorant and unfortunate child, he thought, if they could make a living in their hometown, why would they have to flee to the unfamiliar Shanghai? When they got to Shanghai, they would be without relatives or friends. How would they arrange things? Wouldn't starving to death in Shanghai be the same as starving to death at home? They only brought four dollars and eighty cents when they set off, and now, after deducting the travel expenses, they had less than three dollars left. What to do? As he thought this, he felt that a terrifying barrier had blocked his view, and he couldn't see what kind of world lay ahead. He didn't dare to think any further. If he couldn't find work in Shanghai, wouldn't he starve to death just the same! Well, starving to death in Shanghai would be better than starving to death at home. Anyway, in this day and age, there's no way for us poor people to survive!</p>
<p>He glanced weakly at his wife's worried face. The child had already fallen asleep in her arms. Although he was wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket, it was ultimately too tattered, and the coldness still pricked his skin like needles.</p>
<p>The train rumbled and ran over, stopping with a "嘎!" sound beside the platform. After a while of shouting and squeezing, he and his two sons were also packed on board, which woke up Agou in her arms.</p>
<p>"Mom! Dad! I want to go home and eat!" Agou cried out again, oblivious to the situation.</p>

<h3>A Snapshot</h3>
<p>— CUNYIN</p>
<p>On the street, three people walked in desolation. There were no rickshaws, nor a police officer with his head tucked in.</p>
<p>"Dad! I can't walk anymore."</p>
<p>The child's cold hand tugged at his father's clothes.</p>
<p>"Child! We'll be at Uncle's house soon. Don't bother your dad. Come here, let me carry you!"</p>
<p>She picked up the eight-year-old child.</p>
<p>The father's face was flushed with heat. He carried two boxes with all his might, walking on the street.</p>
<p>"Mom! Why is the city so deserted?"</p>
<p>The child, nestled on his mother's shoulder, asked.</p>
<p>"On cold nights, the city is just like our countryside."</p>
<p>"Then, Dad lied! He said that the city is always colorful, morning and night."</p>
<p>"Don't talk so much! Cold wind will blow into your mouth, and you'll cough!"</p>
<p>"Mmm."</p>
<p>He pursed his lips and agreed. And then, even more silence.</p>
<p>After a while, he fell soundly asleep.</p>
<p>Two pairs of feet walked on the street. There were no shouts of selling evening newspapers, nor those selling sweet rice porridge.</p>
<p>"Ah, just one more turn, and we're there!"</p>
<p>The man sighed and said.</p>
<p>One turn, two turns, they had already been walking for a day! In the morning, after cleaning up at home, the family started out. They didn't have lunch, and they didn't have money to buy dinner, so they had to walk on empty stomachs.</p>
<p>They were all thinking of their uncle!</p>
<p>Their uncle was a living god of wealth. He would help them find a job. If it weren't for their uncle, they would starve to death if they stayed at home! The last resort was to go to their uncle who lived in the city!</p>
<p>"Heaven may not bless us, making us suffer to this point. But, it still has a bit of conscience, giving me an elder brother."</p>
<p>She thought. Her heart felt relieved.</p>
<p>"I remember! The first house, the second house, yes, this one!"</p>
<p>He put down the burden. He hurried to knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Who's there?"</p>
<p>After knocking for a while, someone finally came to ask.</p>
<p>"We're here to see Zhao Afu!"</p>
<p>"Zhao Afu? He doesn't live here anymore."</p>
<p>"Hmm? How can he not live here?"</p>
<p>"He robbed someone's things and was locked up in prison!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The two people stood outside the door, looking at each other. They didn't say anything. The person inside didn't make a sound either.</p>
<p>After a moment, the woman knocked on the door and said:</p>
<p>"What? What... when will he be released?"</p>
<p>The sound of snoring inside was faintly transmitted!</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't knock on the door anymore!"</p>
<p>The husband said, sitting on the steps in disappointment.</p>
<p>×</p>
<p>It was another night.</p>
<p>The wife, dressed very prettily, her face covered with powder, stood on the street corner with many other women. An old woman followed her. She put on a smiling face, facing the male pedestrians. Sometimes, she would open her mouth like this.</p>
<p>"Hey! Want to come to my place and have some fun?"</p>
<p>This voice was filled with shame and pain!</p>
<p>In a dark alley, the husband and child were eating buns.</p>
<p>"Dad! Where did Mom go?"</p>
<p>"She went back to the countryside to get you some cotton clothes."</p>
<p>The dad, deceiving an innocent child.</p>
<p>"Mom also likes to eat these buns!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Dad, why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"Child! I'm not crying! My eyes just hurt! Hey, why aren't you eating?"</p>
<p>"I won't eat! I'll save these two for Mom!"</p>
<p>He obediently hid them in his pocket.</p>
<p>The dad looked at him, and couldn't help but shed another string of tears!</p>

<h3>Bullying the Weak is Most Shameful</h3>
<p>— EDITOR</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Last spring, I entered a foreign goods store of the Lianjia chain as an apprentice. Soon after entering the store, I was greatly bullied by the owner's two sons. Sometimes they would hit me, sometimes they would pat me, or spit phlegm on me. Their various unreasonable actions were really unbearable. If I told the owner (their father), I was afraid of causing bad results, so I was very sad. Yesterday afternoon, I was sitting in a chair, and they ran over again, for no reason took a very long yardstick, and hit me in the body. One of them shouted to hit me. I was hit five or six times, and I couldn't bear it, so I snatched the yardstick and didn't let them hit me. Unexpectedly, they immediately started crying, so the owner ran out and scolded me, saying that I was bullying them, which really made me feel wronged and had nowhere to go. At that time, I was stimulated by this and really wanted to commit suicide, but then I thought that it was not worth committing suicide for such a small matter, so I did not do it. However, how can I deal with such an environment? Sir, please give me an answer! Respectfully wishing you peace. Sincerely, Bao Shan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Bullying the weak is a common phenomenon in society. In all different social strata, such things happen. Bao Jun's current experience is just one of the most minor ones.</p>
<p>We want to advise Bao Jun not to worry too much about this matter. If you think it is a great shame and want to commit suicide, that is even more unwise. Because children are ignorant, why bother arguing with such children? Even if you resist them and win, what is the point? So for this matter, you can only be patient temporarily, or find a way to avoid meeting them, and they will have no way to bully you.</p>
<p>Of course, if you think that the current painful environment is unbearable, then you can ask someone to find another job and try to change the environment. However, before finding a suitable position, it is best to be patient for the sake of job skills.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must say that bullying the weak is really a most shameful thing, and people with this bad habit should actively correct their mistakes. Especially in childhood, this bad psychology cannot be developed. We hope that people will pay attention to this point. Finally, we also hope that Bao Jun and others who are bullied by others will not vent the pain they are suffering now on others when they have power in the future. This meaningless revenge is also unacceptable.</p>
<p>To Liang Chongyu, Lianxin, The Injured, Xie Ren, Cao, Qiuxia, Lu Ying, Mrs. Fang Chen, Biyun, Liu Renjing, Pingying, Shi, Zhang Yanfan, Liu Jianying, gentlemen: Please indicate the mailing address so that we can reply.</p>

<p>Opening: "Idle Talk of the Examination Hall" (Part 3)</p>
<p>Examination candidates are particularly arrogant, consulting diviners to relieve their worries.</p>
<p>Fortune-tellers blindly flatter them, predicting certain success this year with incessant chatter.</p>
<p>Leaving the hall after grading papers during the Mid-Autumn Festival, each examiner praises the high quality of the essays presented.</p>
<p>They enjoy the moon and raise their cups, celebrating with unrestrained drinking all night long.</p>
<p>Internal and external corruption are strictly separated, carefully preventing any potential scandals.</p>
<p>Attention must be paid to the chief examiner's words, as the supervisors frequently arrive to obstruct.</p>
<p>Only when the Double Ninth Festival arrives do they wait for the list of successful candidates, and the announcement of literary fame involves much deliberation.</p>
<p>Once they unexpectedly achieve their soaring ambition, they can proudly wear their embroidered robes.</p>
<p>Loud gongs and drums announce the good news, and their names are marked on gilded red paper.</p>
<p>Wearing down an iron inkstone is no easy feat, but they enjoy the pleasure of their sons receiving official appointments and their wives being granted noble titles.</p>
<p>Those who fail the exam bitterly complain in vain, as ten years of studying vanish like smoke.</p>
<p>They must wait three years to retake the exam, hoping to be noticed in the current dynasty.</p>
<p>(Endless are) the countless idle talks of the examination hall, which I describe with my pen as fleeting clouds.</p>
<p>Wealth and fame are ultimately illusory, and life is like a dream, a sigh of drifting.</p>
<p>(It's better to) retire to the Eastern Mountain with a leisurely spirit, abandoning all worldly pursuits in the field of power and profit, enjoying peaceful years with wine in hand.</p>

<p>Opening: "Urging Donations for Disaster Relief" Author: Willow</p>
<p>Alas, the suffering of the rural villages is unbearable, as disaster strikes again this year after last year's calamity.</p>
<p>The merciless sun shines across the land, turning the earth into a scorched, drought-stricken wasteland.</p>
<p>Causing the farmers to cry out in distress from every household, with no harvest of grain in the fields.</p>
<p>Some have not lit their stoves for a long time, while others support the old and carry the young, their faces covered in tears.</p>
<p>Some compete to strip bark from trees to fill their bellies, while others lie starving in bed, unable to speak.</p>
<p>Their voices are tragic, and their tears flow freely; when will this suffering end?</p>
<p>On this side are the fortunate ones who have not suffered disasters, able to rest peacefully without worry.</p>
<p>On that side are corpses scattered on roads and streets, filling the eyes with grief and chilling the heart.</p>
<p>On this side, they go to dance halls and theaters seeking pleasure, spending thousands of gold coins without hesitation.</p>
<p>On that side, cries shake the earth with broken hearts, and they are helplessly unable to reverse their fate.</p>
<p>I urge you all to show compassion and quickly donate from your wealth to help the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Within the four seas, we are all brothers and sisters; how can we sit idly by and watch them die?</p>
<p>If only we save what we waste in a single day, the lives of millions can be preserved.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Stars' Villas and Estates with "For Rent" Signs</h3>
<p>— Mi Qi</p>
<p>Moving from a large house to a small house, subdividing small houses for rent, turning one family into two, and two into three. This was the housing situation after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai due to economic decline. However, the current economic decline is widespread throughout the world, and Hollywood is no exception. As a result, Hollywood stars are putting their residences, villas, and estates up for rent. Not only are past stars, due to economic hardship and to save expenses, forced to let people live in their mansions, but even current stars, who own one residence in the east and one villa in the west, are compelled to part with some, keeping their Hollywood houses for themselves and renting out the houses in more remote locations to others. Isn't this the same as ordinary people, after suffering financial setbacks, renting out the remaining rooms to others? Before the economic decline, they used to live in Hollywood town on weekdays, at the seaside on weekends, and in estates during holidays. Each location had enormous garages, stables, swimming pools, tennis courts, flower gardens, exercise rooms, theaters, and everything else imaginable, enjoying the blessings of life to the fullest. Money was of no concern, so how could there be any reason to part with and rent them out? Now, since the wave of bank collapses the year before last, hungry wolves are at their doors, poised to enter their homes. Even those who aren't worried about their finances, seeing others downsizing and economizing on daily expenses, dare not flaunt their luxury. Now, let's talk about a few large houses and estates of stars that are now displaying "For Rent" signs.</p>
<p>Marion Davies has a villa on the Santa Monica beach, facing the Pacific Ocean. That villa is merely her "guest house," so of course, in terms of formality and luxury, it cannot compare to her residence in Santa Monica, but it already has twelve bedrooms, six bathrooms, and servants' quarters. The interior is decorated with foreign antiques, making it quite serene and pleasant. Previously, Beryl Burke lived there, paying a monthly rent of $2,500 USD. Now, Marlene Dietrich lives there, paying a monthly rent of only $1,500 USD. Bebe Daniels has become a well-known landlady in Hollywood. She has three houses for rent by the sea. The most expensive is $1,000 USD per month, which Pola Negri used to live in. The interior is extremely luxurious, with a private beach in front. Mary Pickford, everyone knows her Pickfair Mansion, which she and Douglas Fairbanks built together, is a world-famous place, but her villa by the sea is now also displaying a "For Rent" sign. If you are willing to have this American sweetheart as your landlady, paying a monthly rent of $600 USD can be considered inexpensive. It is also built on a private beach.</p>
<p>Norma Talmadge was the most beautiful red star in Hollywood ten years ago. She now also has a seaside villa for rent. In addition to the endless Pacific Ocean for swimming, there is also a freshwater swimming pool, and the rent is only $850 USD per month. Sylvia Sidney is currently living in a house rented from Richard Barthelmess. It is also by the sea, making it ideal for summer retreats. Now that winter has arrived, she is living in Hollywood town and is even considering renting out half of that large house. Lilian Harvey, after moving down from the hills, had her house rented by Myrna Loy. But Myrna Loy is now moving out. If you are willing, just pay a monthly rent of $750 USD. That is very cheap, because that house is built in the Spanish style, with a garden surrounding the house, and the design is extremely ingenious. The furniture inside is all imported from France, which can be said to be exquisitely crafted. In particular, there is a game room with everything from billiards to ping-pong. Colleen Moore's beautiful residence built in Bel Air is now also rented to Marlene Dietrich for a monthly rent of $1,250 USD. The above are just a few examples. The rest need not be listed one by one.</p>
<p>Reader Opinions</p>
<h3>My Review of "Bai Hua Zhou"</h3>
<p>— Fei Nianzu</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this film is another work similar to "Hong Lou Chun Shen" and "Chun Xiao Qu," still an old tune of love entanglement.</p>
<p>The director of this film, Wen Yimin, seems to lack skill in handling the technical aspects and acting, especially in the portrayal of the characters' personalities, which reveals a major shortcoming. For example, Chen Yumei's engagement in children's education is only written as being due to love entanglements and misunderstandings. The sudden transformation of Ye Qiuxin is also written illogically. Other aspects, such as Yu Guang's inconsistency and Ye Qiuxin's violent attitude, all demonstrate the director's immature skills.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Chen Yumei is still competent, but there has not been much progress compared to before. Ye Qiuxin also fails to give us a better impression. Chen Qixia is passable. Yu Guang and Li Ying are mediocre.</p>
<p>Finally, I think it is worth mentioning that the playwright has at least made some progress compared to "Hong Lou Chun Shen," because in "Bai Hua Zhou," in addition to love entanglements, he has also added some significance of serving society.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Shanghai 24 Hours"</h3>
<p>— Wu Sheng</p>
<p>When I saw Shen Xiling's "Shanghai 24 Hours," following "Women's Cry," at the New Light Grand Theater, my soul was deeply moved. Really, at that time, my blood vessels almost burst open.</p>
<p>Clearly, the subject matter of this film is extremely realistic, and the images are stimulating and touching. It depicts the general population living in rural areas who, due to rural bankruptcy, cannot survive and yearn for the superficial prosperity of the city. True, the front of the city is beautiful and splendid, but the back of the city is dark and cruel. The playwright of this film wanted to show the darkness behind the city within 24 hours, the bloody and blurred misery suppressed under the luxurious and licentious life, to let those who yearn for the city know. However, because the whole play was affected by the environment, it changed its original appearance. Therefore, in terms of content and dramatic power, it is loose and has a sense of fragmentation!</p>
<p>The director's use of techniques is commendable. As for the actors' performances, I personally think that Zhao Dan's Old Zhao is the best, and Chen Ningqiu's Chen Da and Zhou Boxun's compradore are also quite competent.</p>
<p>The scenery is very realistic, and the lighting seems a little dim.</p>
<p>The Star Film Company's new film "Bigamy," directed by Wu Cun, starring Gao Zhanfei, Yan Yuexian, and Gao Fuping, is scheduled to premiere at the New Light Theater on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Review of "Peach and Plum Calamity"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Dahui</p>
<p>The author tells us here a very sad and tragic story. In this story, there is a major social problem. A young man who can endure hardship is made unemployed and suffers such a cruel ending for the sake of "justice" and "humanity." Undoubtedly, this is a film with social significance.</p>
<p>The director's technique is indeed not bad, and there are many clever touches. He can fully expose the real phenomena of society, such as the fact that there are hundreds of applicants for a single employee position. There are all kinds of despicable and filthy things in the hotel. Jianping's tearing up of his diploma shows that diplomas are deceptive waste that cannot be exchanged for food. The actors' expressions are very profound, especially Yuan Muzhi and Chen Boer. For directors and actors who have always been engaged in stage plays to have such achievements when they first set foot on the screen is indeed surprising and considered quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>But there are also a few minor flaws: the pronunciation is not very clear in some places. Why did Jianping not have shackles on his hands and feet in prison? The final subtitles are superfluous and do not conform to the meaning of the play. This is probably not the original intention of the playwright!</p>
<h3>Wallace Beery, Jackie Cooper, and Robert Young in a Joint Production of "Treasure Island"</h3>
<p>— Yun Men</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century romantic literature specializes in depicting martial arts, adventure, love, etc. The great writer Robert Louis Stevenson was the last writer of this style and a landmark separating the artistic trends of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As for her poetic talent, it has long been recognized by the world, and her most famous and popular representative novel is "Treasure Island," which is currently being screened in Nanjing. This book has been translated into dozens of languages and is a must-read for those who love literature. Even Mr. Lin Shu Qinnan of our country, in addition to Charles Dickens' novels, also translated this book into "Treasure Island," making it a most popular work.</p>
<p>MGM produced this film at a cost of over a million US dollars. The selection of characters in the film was also painstakingly managed. Wallace Beery, the protagonist of "Viva Villa!", will play Long John Silver, child prodigy Jackie Cooper will play Jim Hawkins, Lionel Barrymore will play the mad Captain, Lewis Stone will play Captain Smollett, and Hessel will play the weird Ben Gunn. Undoubtedly, their talents will not disappoint. As for the background, dialogue, mood, etc., MGM's reputation is sufficient to guarantee it. The Christmas holiday is here, and here is the most wonderful and richest gift contributed by the eighth art.</p>
<h3>Movie Chatter</h3>
<p>Jean Harlow will co-star in a new film with Charles Laughton and Charles Boyer, titled "Peacock Feathers."</p>
<p>"Divorce" will be remade into a talkie, starring George Arliss and Janet Gaynor.</p>
<p>Wang Ying returned to Shanghai from Japan the day before yesterday, but it is said that he has not yet joined Yihua Film Company.</p>
<p>Recently, several foreigners of American and French nationality in Shanghai plan to cooperate with Chinese film companies to raise funds to produce a "standard" Chinese sound film to promote the international market. They have specially invited the world-renowned musician Freeman, who is currently in Shanghai, to compose the music. They claim that they are absolutely certain that the business will be profitable, but this is another means for foreign capital to control the Chinese film production industry. However, it is not known whether the Chinese film company authorities will be lured by them.</p>
<p>The first work of Diantong Film Company, "Peach and Plum Calamity," was sent to Nanjing for inspection the other day. It is said that five sections will be deleted.</p>
<h3>Respectfully Dedicating "Bigamy" to Urban Youths</h3>
<p>— Fire</p>
<p>"Bigamy" is Wu Cun's first concentrated effort since joining Star Film Company. It is also the first collaborative crystallization of the couple Gao Zhanfei and Gao Qianping. Of course, this is an unprecedented masterpiece that every movie fan must pay attention to.</p>
<p>The content of the film depicts an old farmer who drinks the bitter wine of life and works hard all his life, sending his son to the city to study, hoping that he can get an official position. Who knew that this youth was infected with the bad habits of the city, leisurely enjoying himself all day long, drinking deeply from the sweet cup of love. The life of poverty and wealth between father and son is like a world of difference. This is a sketch of a family tragedy and a silhouette of a social tragedy. It has faithful satire and warm exhortations for the frivolous youth of the city. I respectfully dedicate this film to you - the urban youth. The film is scheduled to be shown at the New Light Grand Theater tonight at 9:15.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Bigamy"</h3>
<p>— Fire</p>
<p>In Wu Cun's directed film "Bigamy," there is a subtitle that reads: "There are many sham schools in Shanghai, and these schools have unknowingly buried many promising youths."</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei in "Bigamy" is a truly promising youth, but after he went to university in Shanghai, he was infected with the bad habits of the city and became a frivolous youth.</p>
<p>Every day, when the brilliant night market opened, he put on a handsome suit and secretly climbed out of the school walls with two or three classmates to go dancing. One night, when they returned from dancing, it happened to be raining heavily. In an instant, everyone was drenched, and they climbed back into the school from the walls in a panic. One of the classmates accidentally lost his footing and fell into a water tank at the foot of the wall, and everyone burst into laughter. At this time, those teachers who only took dry salaries were in their gentle homes. And these youths were buried by them in this way. (Editor's Note)</p>
<h3>Silver Screen News</h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>▲......Shao Zuiweng's legal wife died of illness on the evening of the sixth at Tianyi Village in the Tianyi Film Company. The eldest son, Weihe, followed Shao Zuiweng and Chen Yumei to Hong Kong and has not returned.</p>
<p>▲......The filming of "Escape" has been intense these days. The scene at the refugee shelter reported the other day continued until 10:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>▲......Chen Juanjuan, who performed well in "Flying Flower Village," also plays a child role in "Escape," starring Yue Feng and others.</p>
<p>▲......"Immortal Maiden" is now showing at the Capital Theater in Nanjing and is a huge box office success.</p>
<p>▲......Ye Yifang, Guo Bolin, Pan Peizhi, Gu Longgeng, and others have recently founded a film publication called "Silver World," which will be published once a week and is currently in active preparation. It will be published soon.</p>
<p>▲......Yuan Meiyun also plays a very important role in Shi Dongshan's "The Beginning of Man."</p>
<p>▲......Tianyi's Guan Pangzi Hongda has left Tianyi and joined Yihua. (Editor's Note)</p>
<h3>Collection of Short Comments</h3>
<p>— Lin Qin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Many people can't even distinguish the nationality of the world's great writers, yet they still talk about world literature. Are they deceiving the living or cheating the dead?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>To scold someone is considered the most glorious thing in some people's hearts. In fact, the words they use to scold others fit them perfectly.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>I think the duty of a publicist is to promote their own company, but no one told you to specifically sabotage other companies. It seems that the current publicists are specialized in sabotage work.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>What Clara Bow said... what Greta Garbo did, these are all facts idealized by great writers. They didn't personally hear Clara Bow say anything, and they wouldn't translate it from old foreign magazines because they don't understand foreign languages!</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Take a paragraph from a foreign article, write your own name on it, and consider it your own work. Great film theorist!</p>
