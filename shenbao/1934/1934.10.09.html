<h3 id="c13">關於司法院各條文 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>將最高法院名稱取消</p>
<p>今晨繼續審議考試院</p>
<p>（南京）　立法院八日下午二時半、繼續討論憲草、出席委員傳秉常等六十四人、</p>
<p>主席孫科、宣告開會、審議第四章第四節第八十四條、改爲第七十七條、「司法院爲中央政府行使司法權之最高機關」、戴修駿主此條對司法院職權、應加規定、主席亦頗爲然、并參合各委意見、提出修正案、於原條文末、『掌理民事刑事行政之訴訟公務員懲戒及司法行政』、衆無異議、照修正案二讀通過、第八十五條改爲第七十八條、『司法院設院長一人、任期四年、連選得連任、第二項、『司法院長對國民大會負其責任』、審查委員林彬等對本條前項提修正案、當經宣讀、『司法院設院長一人、任期八年、由總統經立法院同意任命之』、並由林彬報告修正經過、</p>
<p>張志韓附議林案、但對八年主仍改四年、</p>
<p>并於『經』字上加『提』字、黄右昌亦主任期四年、因法官保障另有專條規定、程中行謂、司法院長地位、如係政務官、卽應與立法·考試·監察各院長同、任期仍爲四年、如係法官則應終身制、八年終不妥、衞挺生謂、延長司法院長任期、係保障法官、然司法行政部現改隸司法院、則司法院兼有行政官意味、亦予以八年任期、弊端甚大、主席以各方意見付表决、</p>
<p>結果本條前項修正爲『司法院設院長一人、任期四年、由總統經立法院同意任命之』、第二項、仍照原案二讀通過、第八十六條、『在國民大會閉會期間、司法院院長因故去職時、由國民大會委員選舉代理院長』删去、第八十七條改爲第七十九條、『司法院設最高法院公務員懲戒委員會及司法行政部』、審查委員林彬等對本條亦提修正案、經宣讀、『司法院設審判庭檢查署公務員懲戒委員會及司法行政部』、並由林彬解釋、謂將最高法院取消、</p>
<p>與司法院合而爲一、係遵總理遺敎、最高法院内設審判庭與檢查署、故在修正案内亦仍舊照設、以免將來頒布憲法後、牽動司法機關之組織、史尙寛謂、最高法院改爲審判庭檢查署不妥審判庭名稱尤不倫不類、主維原案、黄右昌謂、兵審判庭係開倒車、附史議、謝壽康亦主維原案、</p>
<p>主席説明、謂司法院制度有三種方式、（一）</p>
<p>司法院設院長、另設最高法院長、司法行政部長、此制國府現在試行甚久、惟司法院長似有閒散之嫌、（二）司法院長卽最高法院長、兼管司法行政、此制總理曾在粤試行、徐謙以大理院長兼長司法部卽此例、（三）司法院長兼任最高法院院長、另設一司法行政部長、林等修正案、卽採取此方式、依總理遺敎、司法院卽最高法院旣爲最高法院、又有司法院來管轄、豈非矛盾、且司法院長不兼任司法行政長官、謹處於監督地位、可收審判與行政整齊劃一之效、又無審判與行政權限不清之弊、林案精神大概如此、彭養光主在本條加設行政評判委員會、管理行政訴訟、鍾</p>
<p>天心不贊成林案、主於原案删「最高法法院」四字、另加「兼」字、主席以各委意見付表决、修正爲「司法院設公務員懲戒委員會及司法行政部、三讀通過、第八十八條、改爲第八十條、「最高法院院長公務員懲戒委員會委員長及司法行政部部長、均由司法院長依法律提請總統任免之、」審查委員林彬等主將「最高法院院長」删改爲「司法院審判庭各庭長檢查署檢查長、」史維煥反對新案、主删原案「最高法院院長」數字、另于「公務員懲戒委員會委員長」之下加「委員三字、遂照史案修正二讀通過、第八十九條改爲第八十一條、「關於特赦减刑復權事項、由司法院院長依法律提請總統行之、」陳茹玄主加、「但關於彈効案之判决、不得爲前項之提請、」趙琛·戴修駿·樓桐孫反對之、謂陳舊事重提、按陳曾于討論第四十一條時提加、但旋遭否决、故于討論此條文時、又提出、焦易堂呂志伊附陳議、謂治官應嚴、治民以寛、故主加但書、主席以陳案付表决、贊成者少數、仍照原案二讀通過、第九十條、「法院依法律受理民事刑事行政及其他一切訴訟與非訴訟事件、」此條在第七十七條未修正以前、林彬·呂志伊·周一志·主移至第七十七條後、改爲第七十八條、以鮮明司法院之職權、旋因第七十七條修正通過、故將此條删去、第九十一條改第八十二條、「最高法院有統一解釋法律命令之權、」僅將「</p>
<p>最高法院」數字改爲「司法院、」餘照原案</p>
<p>二讀通過、第九二條、改第八十三條、「法官依法律獨立審判、」原案二讀通過、第九十三條改第八十四條、「法官非受刑罰或懲戒處分、或禁治産之宣告、不得免職、非依法律不得停職轉任或减薪、」史維煥主於法官之下、加「公務員懲戒委員會、」經反對、仍原案二讀通過、第九十四條改第八十五條、「司法院之組織及法院之組織、以法律定之、」主席提議「及法院</p>

<h3 id="c14">西班牙内亂平定　　　恒· <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>我人日前曾謂西班牙議會中之左翼各黨。以勢力式微之故。不能更以合法手段。牽掣右方。以是時謀暴動。藉以威脅右方。不謂今次勒樂組閣以有天主敎黨（亦稱民衆行動黨）三名之故。又行激起左翼之暴動而加太隆省政府。竟至宣布獨立。形勢之嚴重。羣情之洶湧。人心之不安。殆與一九三一年四月間西王遜位之時同。而世人之注意西班身局勢者。亦多難言其前途之何若。孰意曾無幾時。加太隆之獨立政府卽粉碎於政府軍之砲擊重要領袖亦多束手投降。同時各地之零星暴動。亦次第敉平。其情其境。有同演劇革命行動摧毁之易。應無過於此次矣。</p>
<p>然此次左翼革命之失敗。亦意中事。特其失敗至於如是之速。乃爲我人始料所为及耳。蓋西班牙之左翼。黨派紛歧。主張行動。不僅各不相謀。抑且互相矛盾。如阿土那本爲共和行動派之領袖。至去年冬下野之後始與社會黨合作。組織共和左翼。此爲感受右派壓迫一時權宜之計。其勢當難長外設今次加太隆之獨立運動。而稍告成功。則此二派之能否始終和衷共濟亦爲一大疑問此爲左翼革命難獲勝利之一點。再則西班牙之工團主義運動其勢力不在社會黨之下。如加太隆唯一之大都市巴塞洛那。幾爲工團主義者之大本營。此　之主張行動。其性質與無政府黨同。故在西班牙。對此二名稱幾於無甚區别。彼輩所厭惡者爲國家之權力。唯其厭惡權力。故其行動。常無重心無紀律。散漫而不相歸屬。同時對於社會黨共産黨之集産國家亦復深懷疑𢣷。故雖以一時之需要。互相凑合。相與呼應。然其敗事有餘成事不足之勢則早已定之於事前。最後社會黨與共産黨。亦復同床異夢。各懷異志以如是紛雜之黨派。縱令暴動成功於一時。亦何益於西班牙政局之安定故今次行動之必歸於失敗。殆爲遲早間事。</p>
<p>據前日歐電所傳。西班牙左翼今茲之發動。以天主敎黨有復辟之傾向云云。左翼此種宣傳。不始於今日。自去冬右傾國會選出而後。左翼卽以此罪名加諸天主敎黨之身。然揆之事實。殊未盡然。蓋西班牙於未革命前天。主敎會固常爲王室之右臂。唯自革命而後。天主敎徒之放棄復辟。另行組織政黨參預政治。實出羅馬敎皇之敕令。且彼黨亦曾屢次聲言擁護共和以至喪失保皇黨之歡心。於此而觀。復辟一點。似乎過甚其辭。唯天主敎黨爲西班牙今日最右傾之政黨。則爲無可諱言之事實。其所主張者。爲權力政治與統一國家。</p>
<p>所反對者爲分治運動與馬克司主義與工會運動。今爲切實貫澈此類主張計對於左方之壓迫。自將日益嚴厲也。</p>

<p>山本宣稱决撕條約</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美聯社得悉、美國政府官員認意法兩國之新恊調、爲最近穩定時局之最大勢力、意相墨索里尼星期六在米蘭之演説、以爲此種新諒解之效果、不但對於歐洲政局有關、卽對於遠東亦大有影響、至於華盛頓所注意者、爲此項恊調是否能使意法兩國在地中海之海軍競爭得一解决辦法、蓋兩國之海軍建造使英國之海軍地位大爲不穩、據非官塲方面消息、此間盛傳地中海之海軍問題或可解决、故英國目前亦可暫且不必添造軍艦、消息靈通者以爲由此英美或可在明年海軍會議中聯合對日、</p>

<p>（紐約）　安抵美國之日本代表山本氏、</p>
<p>對新聞記者團發表談話如左、</p>
<p>日本政府對於英美兩國政府近將通告廢除華府條約、但其通告之時期尙未决定耳、又日本政府將在倫敦預備會商提出新軍縮方式、該項新方式卽爲一切統治國家須以公正普遍而保障其國防之安全、同時實現實質上之軍備縮减、而制爲具體方案、現在雖未便將該項新方式詳細説明、但對於預備會商之前途、旣未樂觀亦未悲觀、當竭全力而期其成功耳、萬一在此次預備會商未能舉其任何實積、而日本政府仍當不惜努力於軍縮、尙須在海軍軍縮正式會議盡力以求貫徹目的、</p>
<p>倘擁有大海軍之各國盡量維持其公正嚴明之立塲、傾注全力以圖軍縮目的之實現、則無論其爲任何障礙均能克服、吾信其必能得到優秀之成果也云云、（八日日聯電）</p>

<p>稱爲歐洲政治有希望之朕兆、其他報紙意見亦然相仿、惟潘蒂納克氏在巴黎迴聲報之批評、較爲顯豁、稱意相在巴爾都外長啟程往羅馬以前之論調、並未披露意政府之意向、墨氏旣以維護和平爲懷、</p>
<p>而同時又以軍縮失敗爲藉口、將全意八歲至五十五歲之男子全體動員、其所稱之歐洲會議顯然指五强而言、而德國則决不能摒除者也、苟墨氏再謂非正義不能獲得正眞之和平者、則吾人又重蹈修訂主義復轍矣、故意相之演説、殊不能卽視爲巴爾都赴意會晤有成功希望也云云、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>匈牙利無一語道及、深以爲異、且感不安、十月六日因係節令、各報未曾出版、</p>

<p>滿洲里表面平靜</p>
<p>大黑河壁壘森嚴</p>
<p>哈爾濱所聽見的消息、雖不免是片面的、但日軍的緊張、却可以從他們行動看出、準備着隨時應会付萬一事變、是毫無疑義的、可是這裹有一件奇事、就是東三省西北邊境關門滿洲里、日軍方面却非常平靜、駐紥的部隊也很少、好像並不曾積極設防、據此一點以觀、表面上是没有戰意的、而且在那裹的日人都表示平安、從事開發附近的山上、河下所埋藏的森林鑛産、以及水産資源等、隱隱中表示他們要</p>
<p>和蘇聯開發西比利亞相比賽似的、</p>
<p>最初我們覺得這很奇怪、爲什麽蘇聯將薩貝加爾軍都集結起來、在大烏里·在阿巴海圖等地帶、駐得有九個以上的步兵團、七個騎兵團、分配得有一百二十門大砲、六十多架飛機、三個坦克車中隊、三列鐵甲車、十五架裝甲汽車、一個化學大隊、並Ｇ·Ｐ·Ｕ·（政治保安隊）若干、這些部隊的後方、有伊爾庫次克·下烏丁斯克兩大空軍根據地、托姆斯克·俄姆斯克·諾佛西比爾斯克等處、都駐得有重兵、算是對遠東的預備隊、一朝有事之際、頃刻間卽可以在赤塔集中、我們試上滿洲里附近的小山去看看、就可以望見對面俄境排列着整肅的兵營、到處張佈着鋼骨混凝土的堡壘、</p>
<p>性急而喜歡戰爭的日本人目覩着這樣情况、又聽聞西比利亞鐵道敷設雙軌、晝夜兼工、何以竟能如此從容應付、還是　孜於經濟的基本工作、經記者再三考察、　知道日軍以爲滿洲里背枕呼倫池、於額爾古納河恰是個背水陣、如果要守這塊地方、或是作進攻的根據地、都於軍略上不利、所以他在滿洲里、在海拉爾都不設防衛、旣裝出了和平模樣、又作成軍事的企圖、她把一切的軍事要塞都建築到大興安嶺山脈一帶去、這些山邊林際非但有堅固的砲壘、隱蔽的戰壕、並且還佈置得有高射砲位、</p>
<p>最主要的工作是在海拉爾河·根河·得爾布爾河·三支流、都廣殖着白俄人民、他們對蘇聯深懷仇恨、對赤黨幾不共戴天、</p>
<p>日人對他們則多方撫慰、要他們將來爲日本所用、現在受日方的驅遣、這般人亡命異國、也很想翻身、所以不惜聽用、</p>
<p>其實軍事上的重點、無論是蘇聯方面、日本方面、一旦用兵、其戰爭的中心、陸上戰鬥、不在西部的滿洲里、也不在東部的綏芬河、而會在黑龍江省旁黑龍江岸的大黑河、黑河下游約八十里是有名的愛琿城、隔着一條約一里寛的對江、就是蘇聯的領地海蘭泡、假如日本採取攻勢、那就必然運用洮昂路·呼海路·及正在建築中的二站黑河鐵道、渡江而東、突破海蘭泡的防綫、剪斷烏蘇里鐵道與西比利亞鐵道的聯絡、使沿海省、與貝加爾不能互相呼應、伯力的遠東軍司令不能指揮全軍、日軍就可以海陸夾擊海參崴、相機占領東西比利亞地域、在蘇聯恐怕也會以海蘭泡爲重點、速渡黑龍江、突破黑河、越小興安嶺、南下克山可以進窺哈爾濱、西攻龍江可以襲擊洮南、這是她們所必爭之地、所以日本在黑河、在愛琿都駐紥着重兵、並修築交通網、小興安嶺的設防</p>
<p>雖不甚週密、但也很注意籌劃嚴密防範、深怕黑河有失、東三省全綫震動、</p>
<p>松花江與黑龍江交流的三角地帶、糾紛特多、更容易惹起問題、在三义河口、雙方都張佈着鐵絲網、陸上則另有警備、日本在水上還藉用傀儡之名、備有兩艘九百噸的大型砲艦、載八生的砲四門的砲艦四艘、百噸小砲艦八艘、裝載飛機的小航空母艦二艘、水上飛機八十架、專門監視蘇方偷渡、爭取軍事上的便宜、可是蘇方也連營相望、戒備森嚴、輕易不肯讓日軍飛越、他們二者間互相對峙、各人都要掌握著軍事的優勢、建立鞏固的軍事根據是顯然的、（十月一日）</p>

<p>將於今日在本市試飛、其另一架、亦正由海司氏裝配、大約一星期許、卽可裝竣、俟兩新機試飛成續良好、卽行恢復滬粵航綫、其復航日期、至　約　月初旬、又前次因尋覔失踪之第十七號塞可斯機、而在西沙島爲風浪擊壞之第十九號塞可斯機、現已完全修復、惟因與道格拉斯機之</p>

<p>航業公會爲引水費事</p>
<h3 id="c124">函復總税務司 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>詳述事實理由代商請命</p>
<p>俾免迫成停航影響大局</p>
<p>航業同業公會爲引水管理委員會、增加長江短期引水費率事、業經根據議决案、分向院部呼籲、並聲明如果强迫、則卽停航候命、一面分函海關總税務司·江海關税務司及引水管理委員會、在未奉院部批示以前、對於新章請暫緩實行、旋接羅代總税務司覆函、囑爲轉勸航商、經該會轉致各公司後、復據詳述事實理由、囑爲轉覆羅代總税務司、請代航商請命、俾免迫成停航、影響大局云云、茲將覆函原文、探錄如下、</p>
<h3 id="c125">引水管理海關中堅 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>逕復者、案准貴署第一零一零號公函、囑向各會員勸導、對於新訂引水費率、勿加反對、俾中國收回引水權事項、得以進行順利等由、節經分轉有關係各會員公司去後、茲據復稱、引水管理委員會之非全屬於海關管轄之下、原爲航商听知悉、是以對於引水費率、分呈院部、請勿加增、</p>
<p>惟該會主席、旣係海關之海務巡工司、增費理由、有主席之説明、强制執行、爲海關所担任、是該會縱非全屬海關所管轄、而海關已爲該會之中堅也明矣、况羅代總税務司所述各點、又均以引水人爲主觀、益足證海關之側重引水人也、今更就來函中不符事實者、分别聲述於下、</p>
<h3 id="c126">商會代表屢持異議 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>（一）原函所稱「該會各委員中、本有上海市商會所推代表一人在内、當會議時、並未聞其對於新費率有何異議」一節、查本年五月二十二日、</p>
<p>上海市商會曾接該會委員陳天駿君（即上海市商會代表）來函、對於修改引水費率、認爲太巨、</p>
<p>於會議時屢加陳述、並曾於四月四日、致函該會主席奚理滿君、聲請仍暫照原有費率收取、六月二十二日、市商會復據陳君函送擬訂費率表、</p>
<p>並聲明曾於六月十五日會議時、以事關航商經濟、須先向航商徵求意見、請將增加費率、暫緩討論、公會亦經擬具意見、函請市商會請陳君重行提出、是不但早有異議、而且　有異議、均有案𦢌可資按證、今謂並未聞有何異議、殊屬抹煞一切、萬難承認、</p>
<h3 id="c127">引水俸厚人材甚多 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>（二）「從前引水費率、規定過低、以致引水人月薪所入、爲數極少、有時僅能支給國幣五元或十五元、値茲生活程度日形增高之際、似此徵薪給安足以資維持、且僱用合格引水人、必須使其生活安定、方能維致專材、故引水人薪給、自有酌予提高之必要、而對於引水費率、勞不得不重行改訂、以裕取入二節、查各輪船公司所僱長期引水人之月薪、固至少各有一二百元以内、至臨時僱用者、每趟薪給、更各有二三百元以内、</p>
<p>其收入旣如斯豐裕、生活何至不能安定、查淞漢引水專材衆多、本無須以重幣羅致、平時一有輪船開入長江之訊、持海軍部執照之引水人、至公司攬接引水者、户限爲穿、此固可證人材之多、</p>
<p>又可證薪給之豐、故均樂於担任也、羅代總税務司復函所述引水人月薪有時僅能支國幣五元或十五元云云、與事實大相逕庭、益使人莫明眞相矣、</p>
<h3 id="c128">外籍引水向未雇用 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>（三）「新訂費率、對於吃水較深之船隻、雖較前增出稍多、但亦不及半數、以視淞漢外籍引水人所收費用、幾超過該委員會者三倍、殊不得謂爲過鉅」一節、查新訂費率、吃水較深之船、所加確在一倍以上、如華戊船引水舊價、淞漢來回一次、計洋四百五十元、今照新章來回作兩單程計算須實收洋九百九十一元一角四分、可以證明、至我國行駛滬漢綫各輪船、近十餘年來、向未僱用外籍引水人、根本已不存在、何從引爲比例、耶退一步言、倘任何公私事業、僱用國人之薪給、而必以外人爲比例、又决非公帑未甚充裕之國家、營業日見衰頽之工商所能担負、斯説而果堅持實行也、是將使國家之經濟、與企業之消費、</p>
<p>立陷於絕境、固不僅航商之不勝負荷已也、</p>
<h3 id="c129">收回主權應减費用 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>（四）「中央政府對於引水權正圖積極收回」一節、查引水權之應收回、計分兩項、（甲）上海領港公司之外人領港、是項領港、專領各國郵船貨船、由大戢至上海、及由上海至大戢、其數十人中、華人僅有其一、不但取費太昂、爲各外輪所反對、而且國防之藩籬盡撤、關係實爲巨大、政府對於是項領港權、圖謀恢復、原屬正當辦法、而亦即政府設立引水管理委員會之主旨也、該會旣以此爲主旨、自當本此主旨、積極進行、方不負國家之委任、辜人民之希望、（乙）淞漢領港、即掦子江引水、我國輪船、不雇用外人引水者、固屬歴年已久、即外商如太古怡和等洋行、</p>
<p>所行駛掦子江各班輪之長期引水人、亦均僱用華人、惟外商輪船、駛達中國國境、轉入掦于江者、則尙有雇用日本人所設立之掦子水先恊會之日人、及其他英人德人爲引水之事利、就此點而收回之、原屬必要、但其辦法、似應减輕國人引水費率、以期舍彼就此、若爲收回引水起見、而增加費率、是直南　而北撤矣、</p>

<h3 id="c130">强令雇用責任誰屬 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>又有説者、引水人關係全船安危、極爲重大、故在僱用時、（一）必須船東絕對信任、（二）必須船長、</p>
<p>肯代對外負責、（三）必須水保船値之保險行許可倘必越俎代謀、强令航商僱用不願用之人、則因引水人之過失、而發生之一切責任及損失、在船東船長與保險行、當然不能担任、試問是否越俎代謀、强令僱用者代負刑罰及賠償之責、此尤各公司所亟欲明瞭者也、羅代總税務司旣以引水人薪給極少、爲增率之原因、具見顧全技衛人員生活之美德、但其結果、僅顧全少數、而遺棄多數、造成畸形、使原有人員、欲求低微生活而不可得、不但失情理之平、竊恐與共和國家人民平等之主旨、背道而馳矣、此又各公司所莫測高深者也、</p>
<h3 id="c131">不達目的恐難轉圜 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>其餘各項理由、業已詳述於分陳院部一電中、</p>
<p>應請公會將電稿抄送羅代總税務司察洽、以免　述、並請見覆等語前來、敝會覆按所稱、事實允符、理由充分、奉函以後、雖經敝會分别商勸、</p>
<p>勿走極端、但各公司以事關切身痛苦、且行動又經公决、不達目的、恐無轉　之餘地、准函前由爲再抄附分陳院部電稿、據情轉達、敬希察洽、</p>
<p>代爲航商請命、俾免迫成停航、影響大局、無任盼切、並候賜覆、此致海關總税務司、</p>

<p>我國絲紗兩業、受外貨傾銷影響、絲廠殆盡停業、紗廠雖勉强維持、亦莫不虧耗、</p>
<p>實業部最近特派工業司科長李崇典、由京抵滬、調查兩業情形、並商救濟辦法、</p>
<p>茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>衰落狀况　（一）絲業受日絲傾銷歐美影響、以致華絲市價步跌、每担標準絲、已跌至四百元左右、絲廠繅成之絲、虧耗甚鉅、不得已惟有停業已待時機、今江浙絲廠殆盡停業、以上海市而言、開工者不及十分之二、（二）紗業我國紗廠、近受農村衰落、及外貨傾銷影響、銷路大减、</p>
<p>各廠均减工維持、今年各地新花、均已上市、又値豐收、最近各地銷路、雖見起色、</p>

<p>但是我們在這個應當努力的時候、凡是施救被燒夷彈起火所用的砂土與消火器具、及防火所用的水桶等類的物品、我們都要在平時去充分的準備、在可能範圍内、並且要購置防毒面具、以便戰時敵機的燃燒彈與毒氣彈同時投下的時候、可以從事救火工作、</p>
<p>但是、在戰時如遇燃燒彈落下的候、務須立即使用砂土掩壓撲滅之、阻止其延燒、若已延燒而及於他物時、就應即用消火器具、或水桶灌水撲滅之、雖隣居巷内的居民、亦須立時聚集、互相恊力施救、此外如官署·學校·工廠·及各大公司、應須常備消防器具、將職員·職工·學生·編成消防隊、預爲訓練、那末、有了戰時的準備、如遇平時的災害發生、也就更可收得消防的效益了、</p>
<p>以上專就消防一項來説、市民所負的責任、是這樣的緊要、而在空襲時、所有防毒·救護·工務·警備·交通整理、警報傅達、等等的勤務、也是須要以市民担任爲主、因爲遣是與市民關係最切的事務、如果市民不自動的來担任、雖有政府來領導、也是不容易收到週密而廣遍的效果、所以市民與防空的關係、確是至爲密切、防空的任務、也確是全在於市民、</p>
<p>最近、我們的政府當局、感着國難頻仍、危機四迫、强鄰的野心、方興未艾、一朝有事、我們的重要城市、必將頃刻間遭其空襲、而化爲灰燼、因此、用于去年十一月間、在首都舉行初次的防空大演習、這在全國的防空設施上、可説是有了一個創導、因爲這次的防空演習、不僅是給予南京市民對於防空有了極深刻的認識、同時全國的民衆、亦因此對於防空的需要、也有相當的感覺、不遇、我們旣然對於防空有了相當的認識知道是一個迫切嚴重的問題、我們就應當要積極的去研究、努力的去設施、雖然我國是財力缺乏、事事落後、應有的國防建設、都不是一時可能辦到的、但只要我們全體的同砲、能够抱定苦硬幹的决心、也就不難迎頭趕上去、以與列强併駕的、（完）</p>

<p>近手工業衰落的情形，雖還幸未失業，也祇好混口飯吃，生活是困苦極了，短衫褲穿成醬油色。剪頭洗浴的錢都没有，現在約略寫幾個人的説話在下面，亦是嚴重的社會問題吧。</p>
<p>一個做裁縫的説：「人家都以爲衣服總省不了的，話雖不錯，可是這年頭兒市面不好，錢不容易掙，普通人家日常開支，那一椿不在打着緊縮的算盤、譬如。式樣舊的翻一翻，大的改小，皮的換個面子亦就算了，新衣服能省便省，這一來，我們做裁縫的就没有了出息，作檯板上冷清清地，裁縫司務　着眉頭在打五關，你想，還弄得好嗎！」</p>
<p>一個做書套的説：「唸書朋友都知道的吧，眼前甚麽書本兒統改了精裝洋裝本了，前些時，還有一部份線裝書用書套，現在可也受了書店競爭傾銷的影響，把許多古書舊小説翻版成爲單本，貼了洋紙封面，認書套是落伍多餘的東西了。做書套的人，亦因之而被剝奪了飯碗。」</p>

<p>這又是一節極難得到的專門學識，我們聽了，都覺得很有趣味無數的視綫，齊集中在那匹久積塵垢，今天才草草地打掃過的森馬的身上，而太后是格外的揚揚自得了。</p>
<p>把從前人這種艱苦勇武的生活，和現在的皇宮中的生活來互相比較、眞不知道要有多少的差别！幾乎使我們不能相信從前的滿洲的統治者眞能這樣的耐苦奮鬥！其實倒是一些不假的！不但領袖的人如此，凡宮内所有的一切皇親國戚，大臣近侍，可説是没一個不天天在這種生活中鍜鍊磨勵着的：到此刻，幾百年的奢侈的中土生活，已完全把我們軟化了。</p>
<p>其時，我們已把這三間不小小的宮殿全參觀到了。便仍由太后領導着，走到了外面的廣塲上去，這一片廣塲上，在從前差不多是天天有人在這裏憑着他的胆氣和勇力、跟那些爪犀利的野獸們性命相搏，現在呢，已變爲一片全無用處的荒地了，可是塲的西邊的一帶森林，却是鬱鬱蒼蒼的更茂盛了，高大的樹影，在地上晃動着，險些使我們懷疑裏面將有什麽野獸衝出來了，太后抬着頭，往四面隨意眺望了一回，彷彿很感慨地嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>當我們决定要上這裏來之前，太后曾在盛京的宮院中説過一段關於這一日的紀念史的大略，而且還允許我們在見到了這裏的一座森林以後，再把詳細的情形告訴我們：現在。我們是已經到了這座森林前面來了，于是伊的預約也實踐了！（二二六）</p>
<p>一個做紅木的説：「我們是靠手勁兒吃飯的，只要拉得動一天鋸，就不愁肚子餓，可是，眼前的一輩子都講求洋派了，用西式木器，闊綽一些的更不用説從拉水馬桶到克羅蜜牀牀，而且，小件又不通洋莊了，如今有了氣力没活兒幹，活該是我們的絕路嗎！」</p>
<p>還有磨溙的，做銅匠的········也寫不了許多，總之，都市裏一部份有購買能力的，崇歐化，日常所需，均爲舶來品，連如厠用的草紙，亦不是國產了。至於内地，本來所有的衣着用具，尙要送到當舖裏去押錢，還有什麽購買能力可以説呢？以上所造成的結果，是，中國民族工業日趨没落，而手工業便隨在機製工業後面崩潰了。</p>

<p>食物有各種不同的滋味，辨别這滋味就全靠着口。</p>
<p>口能嘗出甚麽是甜，甚麽是鹹，甚麽是酸，甚麽是苦，甚麽是辣。</p>
<p>人們的口味也各有不同。大部分算起來：歡喜吃甜的要佔最多數，其次，則是歡喜吃的鹹：再次則是歡喜吃的和吃辣的，至於歡喜吃苦的，那説是絕無僅有的了。</p>
<p>我的二哥很愛吃酸，每次吃麵的時候他總是嚷着湯味太鹹，有一次家裏人故意給他的麵湯裏只放些醋，等他吃完了，問他湯味怎樣？他説：「今天的湯味很好，只是鹽少了些。」其實他不知道湯裏根本就没有放鹽呢！這也是關於口味的笑話喲。</p>
<p>一個廚子要想得到主人的歡心。似乎先要知道主人的口味，但這樣却不能算是良好的廚手，眞正良好的廚子，是要能燒出美味的菜肴，使得吃的人都能遷就他和口味。</p>

<h3 id="c211">夜訪天寗寺（火雪明） <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>中國佛敎之盛，由來甚久，各地故多叢林古刹，早已著名於世，單就天寗寺而論，已有四處，北平藃寗間外是、處，江都天寗門外是一處、廣東海康縣西關外又是一處、而我所説的却在常州城東門外唐朝啓建的那一所。</p>
<p>旅行到常州，正是初冬無雪的陰天，走進火車站、看遠處城心，已滿綴着明潔的燈火、夜風吹得非常之勁，喚一輛人力車，獨個兒進城，打算去痛喝一次蘭陸名酒、狠呑一次薄皮鮮潔的花猪肉，因爲自家還初次拜訪、讓車夫拖到那裏便是那鄽、對於經過的市街名稱、可以説完全茫然；但依據這商業在晚上不甚發皇的市容看來、也還與宜興的歸城相似。</p>
<p>車子在小浮橋被停下來。好在燈火正燒旺了夜市；踅向橋西、在縣直街瞥見了德順菜館、肚子正餓得慌，便上樓去修理五臟廟」。不用説酒味是及不到紹興的東浦興阮社，當初李太白的「蘭陵美酒鬱金香」、只是偶然的狂語；倒是東坡肥肉、比湖北黄州的不輸若干、我尤其愛吃那色香味俱美的糖浸芹菜！</p>
<p>醉飽下樓，一想天寗寺裏正住着餐病的朋友，與其花錢向騷閙逆旅中度這悠寂的寒宵，不如去古寺裏找他談的好，而况順便也得探聽探聽他最近的健康，所以用電話通知寺裏，請他們不要把山門早早的關上。</p>
<p>依舊坐上街車、在夜凉如水的月明裏、看看冷静下來的大街小巷，看看變幻的幾點星辰，有着一些征途孤寂的悲感。託福車夫的腕力，給我拉向東直街去。聽城上打更的鑼聲，慢慢兒輕了遠了。</p>
<p>轉轉戀戀，不知奔了多少路。爲了疲勞，只閉着眼抽長自已的思緒。雖然冷風容易吹醒淺醉。但自已浸沈在更深的夢幻裏。竟糢糊得忘記了看那夜色中的建築物。</p>
<p>倒是車出城東門，在油燈的黄暗光氛裏，約略辨出有三五個逃荒的乞兒。枯坐在稻草上打盹，於是我就完成了一首五律：「窮醉尋歸宿，孤跡偶訪禪。霜衣披午月，風絮逼丁年！客路聞饑鳥，豪門沸管絃。傷時吾輩事，無計問聾天」。打算停一回誦給抱病的好友。看他怎麽批評。</p>
<p>幾乎走盡東直街，東夫突然發問，聲音帶着急喘；</p>
<p>「先生，是不是一直拉進天寗寺呢？」</p>
<p>這一來、把我正在玩味詩句的沉思剪斷了。</p>
<p>睜開眼一瞧，左面便是一座灰色的女牆，中央開了一個彎圓形的門洞，月光正滿流在洞内的廣塲上，有着高大的緣樹，散植凉蔭，一簇一簇的眠着。當我對車夫把乎指向山門一揮的瞬間，車輛就急遽地滾進去了。</p>
<p>不知是車上鈴聲的緣故呢，還是宿鳥偶然的夜啼：倒警動了一匹酣睡的黄狗，它就跳起來狂暴地亂吠。在静寂之夜，眞是容易騷擾那候門的山僧的。</p>
<p>這時，天上正有一片凍雲飛過，暫把月兒掩没；空院裏惟有沉沉的暗黑，樹葉在風中歌嘯，趁着犬吠，情景眞是動人。眼看劈面山門裏。隱約地透出一點小小的紅燈，似乎在移動，移得很快，好像　夜海中的塔燈；但燈光越移越近。也越近越大，漸漸瞧出提燈人的面貎，那還不是個戴着高　　的和尙？我馬上跳上車，付了車錢，慌忙奔向紅燈就樹邊。感激地説：</p>
<p>「師父，勞神了！要你久等。」</p>
<p>「不要緊！先生不是從城裏來？」和尙站定了反問我。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c240">濾波電容器的耐壓問題（李元慶） <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>新近和朋友修了幾只式樣不同的交流收音機丨丨丨有的是購置現成的，有的是自行裝配的，可是發現的弊病，却完全一樣丨丨丨都是濾波電空器（FilrerCon</p>
<p>denser(因過載而短路，這不是一件很奇怪的事情麽？</p>
<p>商品化的收音機，因爲要力求地位嬌小和售價低廉的緣故，不得不儘量减少各零件的體積和數量，因此，其濾波電容器之不能耐用，事屬當然。但是自製的收音機，却又爲什麽也犯着同樣的弊病呢？那便令人有些不解了！</p>
<p>據我猜想，大概還有許多人對於濾波電容器的耐壓問題，還没有相當的認識吧！</p>
<p>我們知道，凡是電容器，都有一定的耐壓度，（VoItagerating）且如果超過了這規定的電壓，便足以影響牠的壽命，這是確切不移的事實。</p>
<p>通常電容器上所標明耐壓的數目，是代表直流電壓而不是交流電壓。不信，你試將一個標明能耐壓五百弗打的電容器接在五百弗打的交流電路内、保險不久便有短路之虞！</p>
<p>要解釋上述特殊的現象，便不能不先從交流電壓的本身談起。</p>
<p>所谓交流電壓，並不像直流電壓那樣簡單。嚴格的説起來如果我們單説「交流電壓」四個字，那是毫無意義的，必須要説明何種交流電壓纔行。</p>
<p>原來交流電壓的本身，是一種正弦波動式(SinewaveForm)的。（見附圖）牠的數値。隨時隨刻變動着，並不一定。人們爲使用便利起見，便把牠分成下述三種數値：</p>
<p>（一）有效交流電壓交流電壓，隨時變動，已如上述，這樣，我們不是很難得到一個確定的數値麽，科學家爲解决此項困難起見、第一步便指定：交流電壓能產生與直流電壓同樣功用的數値，便呌做有效流電壓，（ＥffectiveＶalue</p>
<p>ofA.CVojtage)通常所謂交流電壓或是交流電壓表内所測到的數値，都是屬於這一種。其數値約爲最大交流電壓的，七０七倍。</p>
<p>（二）最大交流電壓所謂最大交流電壓，（MaximumVaiueofA,CVolta</p>
<p>ge)便是交流電壓在最高峯的數値，所以又呌做峯壓，（PeadVoltage）其數値約爲有效値之一·四一倍。</p>
<p>（三）平均交流電壓這裏所説的平均交流電壓，（AverageValueofA.C.</p>
<p>Voltage)並不是交流電壓在一循環（CYc</p>
<p>le)内的平均値，（一循環之平均値恰爲零）乃是指半循環而説的，（如圖C至D及F至G卽是）其數値約爲有效値之·九倍。</p>
<p>交流電壓表内所測到的數値，是有效値，而不是最大値，已見上述。實際上在每一循環内，仍能碰見最大値二次。所以我們在交流電路内，使用電容器或其他任何零件，必須要能够耐住最大値纔行。換句話説：至少須要能够耐得住有效値的一·四一倍，纔能適用。　　這樣看來。可知以五百弗打的電容器，接在交流電路内。實際上牠受到的電壓。最大時有500*1.41=705弗打之多丨丨丨超越牠規定的耐壓度，幾有半倍之勢，又怎能没有危險呢？</p>
<p>例如某收音機的輸出管爲丨丨45,當屏壓爲275弗打時，丙電壓約爲五十六弗打，再假定低週率阻流綫圈内的電壓降爲四十弗打，那麽，濾波電容器所受到的有效電壓，已達三百七十一弗打，其最大値爲375X1.41=523.11弗打。在此種狀態之下，如果再貿然接上五百弗打的電容器、其不能耐用，自在意料之中。</p>
<p>有時外來電壓過高，或變壓器因發熱而使波形失眞（ＷaveＤislortiun）時。其最大値往往會超出有效値之一·四一倍。所以在交流電路内。應用的各種絕緣物，通常爲求安全起見，總以能耐有效値之一·五倍爲標準。因此，上述的電容器，應採用能耐371X1.5=55615</p>
<p>弗打的纔好，可選擇與此數最近，能耐壓七百弗打者用之，（注意：通常電容器上所標明的耐壓度，係商品之廣告語，事實上至少也須打個八九折纔行，所以選用七百弗打的電容器，並不算多，　　還有電空器遇到熱度，也會影響到牠的耐壓數目，所以電容器在收音機内所安放的地位，以能遠離電源變壓器以及眞空管等發熱部份爲妙。這一點也得附帶説明的。</p>
<h3 id="c241">强力交流機改接聽筒（明襄） <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>自强力交流收音機盛行以來、聽筒似已成爲過去時代的遺物、先之置備者，今都棄之如廢物，其實在許多情形之下，我們時常覺得聽筒的需要，例如深夜收聽音樂時，用揚聲器放音，勢必擾人清夢，自不若改接聽筒爲聒静，喜玩短波的同志，若以揚聲器接收遠距離電台音樂，往往因訊號徵弱，一無所獲，如能改接聽筒，不難得意外的收獲，家中設有年老或聽學有缺憾者，他人認爲調節至適度音量時，彼尙不能辦别。自最好分接一聽筒，使其亦能享樂。</p>
<p>本篇所述二種最簡單的方法。可使聽筒適用於任何收音機，第一法，在收音機末級輸出管的屏極上，添一接綫、Ａ一接壳圖　經斷路電容器Ｃ接至一單路聽筒插口一之端，</p>
<p>其另一端接收音機壳，如圖一Ａ，插口可裝置在收音機木箱側面，設或輸出級係用兩個眞空管，接成推挽式者。插口之二端，須各經一斷路電容器，連接於兩眞空管的屏極，如圖一Ｂ。</p>
<p>使用時，祇須將聽筒插頭插入插口内。卽可收聽，至於收音機的調整手續，仍與平時一樣，如爲接收遠地電台，僅需聽筒内發音，可在揚聲器的音圈接綫内。添接一開關關斷之，如專爲聽覺不便者而添接聽筒，可將開關關開啟，揚聲器同時放音·</p>
<p>第一法音量之調節。須在收音機原二固　有的音量控制器上調節之，聽筒内之音量，不能單獨調節，殊爲不便，故有第二法之補救，卽聽筒不直接插入收音機之插口内，而另以一音量控制器代之，如固二，ab兩端可接收音機上的插口，以聽筒插入J2内調節Ｒ，使聽筒内音量適合其個人的需要。</p>
<h3 id="c242">放大週率區别ＫＭＫ <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>不論是一架收音機抑是一架放大機，欲使牠有充分音量的輸出，則勢必有相當放大的裝置，普通放大計分高週率放大(RadioFrepuencyAmplifier)中間週率放大（intermediateFrequency）</p>
<p>Ampjilier)及低週率放大大）ＡudioＦrepu</p>
<p>encyAmelifier）等三種高週率放大係放大由播音台射出的高週率電浪，經該眞管放大後而輸出的，依舊爲高週率電浪，其原理則不過是加强外來電訊使檢波级易於接收罷了。</p>
<p>中間週率放大者多數皆使用外差式或超等外差式收音機中，所謂中間週率者是已經過一番相當檢波而成的。該項檢波謂之第一級檢波，雖然高週率電浪已經檢波了，可是牠所檢收的訊號人耳依舊不能聽聞的，故在此間加以放大日中間週率放大。並加以調正在兩綫圈互感間，再經第二級檢波方始成爲成音低週率，因該項方式調正部份多、故選擇性極爲優良。</p>
<p>低週率放大者是放大已經檢波的成音低週率電浪，該項放大成效較前兩法爲大，只不過不能加以調節部份，選擇性當然較前法爲遜。倘加以多級低週率放大，則音調勢必失眞，故在舶來品收音機中低週率放大至多是只採用一級的。</p>
<h3 id="c243">最新音調控制法（李元慶） <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>通常控制音調的方法，大概是在低週率放大綫路内，（初級或次級）並接上一個固定電容器，和一個變量電阻器。使用時。减低電阻便能將週率較高的音調割脱，（Ｃut）結果，揚聲器内發内的聲音。便能十分沉悶。（請參閲本刊第十六期拙作（「音調控制法」）</p>
<p>「音調控制」（ＴoneＣontrol）顧名思義。便應當能够隨意控制音調的高抵纔行，可是上述的音調控制器。却祇能將高音删掉，充分放出低音。而不能將低音减少，儘量發出高音。這是牠的缺點！</p>
<p>西樂音調高亢，樂器衆多，每當二三十人合奏時，其聲隆隆，噪音極多。所以必須要删除高音節的聲浪後。纔能悦耳動聽，中樂便不這樣，譬如：一個旦角隨着京胡唱戲，平時已嫌單調，如果再加上上述的音調控制器，那麽，聽的人便要以爲拉的是把破胡琴，喝的是個嗡鼻子呢，這是中西音樂組織和中西人士聽覺不同的地方。不可使之强合的。</p>
<p>最近在英國業餘無綫電)AmateurWireiess）雜誌内看到一篇新式的音調控制器。却能補救上述的缺點特爲扼要迻譯於左。以供同好。</p>
<p>如圖，Ｌ爲》３至。４bv之阻流綫圈。Ｃ爲o.imf之固定電容器。Ｒ爲１００００歐姆之電位表，（均並接於低週率變壓器初級綫圈内，如附圖虚綫内所示。）當電位表Ｒ停止在中心點時，本器無甚作用，此時揚聲器内放出之音調。高低適中。Ｒ旋向右方時，週率較高之音節，均從Ｃ處溜去，發出之聲調，便非常沉悶。Ｒ旋向左方時，週率較低之音節，均從Ｌ處脱逃，發出之聲調，便能極有生</p>

<p>在電台林立的上海，選擇性這個問題，確實是難以解决的，除有多級高週率調正以及超等外差式收音機選擇性較好外，普通綫路收音機選擇性，尤爲惡劣甚至有四五家混在一起的，上項弊病除减短天綫，减少初級綫圈，以及調節天綫回路，外似乎已别無他法，現在作者來介紹增加選擇性的極好方法，想爲讀者所歡迎的吧！　　綫路見圖Ｌ爲初級回路綫圈，Ｌ爲再生式再生綫圈，Ｌ２爲局外調正綫圈，Ｌ３爲柵回路綫圈（卽次級回路綫圈，）照該圖設計選擇性極爲優良，綫圈可用念六號絲包繞在蛛綱板上，Ｌ須較普通者多繞些，Ｌ１則須視眞空管特性爲定，Ｌ２，Ｌ３各繞六十五圈，照圖次序排例，其間距離可試騐適當後而固定之，Ｃ，Ｃ，皆係０·０００三五ＭＦ變量電容器。</p>

<p>本月交貨不足　標花前市開盤、因疲弱數目之美棉、今則突然轉漲、而遠月漲風益熾、印棉粗貨跌、細貨漲、同時本月份收貨雖不多、然空方交貨太少、成交數尙剩八萬餘担、散空鑒於交貨籌碼不充足、祇得活動抵補、因之市盤愈昂、但大户空頭仍安然不補、各月均漲一二角、午後開盤、聞印棉暗盤又飛漲五羅比二五、市情尙好、但拍至三收盤、有一部份獲利者了結、本月未動、遠跌五分、查賣出源大一千担、通記一千五百担、大孚二千三百担、賡豐一千五百担、生源一千二百担、益康一千担、愼記一千三百担、元一一千二百担、長豐一千担、買進大豐二千五百担、長豐二千六百担、新亨二千八百担、源興昌一千七百担、一日間最高代價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈先定繼則瀉跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、回漲一二角左右、當開價時、以洋麥報好、市氣平穩、惟至二盤以後、因紛市步落、且市塲仍有洋麥套貨、故市氣即逆轉、人心頓虚也、迨至下午開盤、本月份因結賬伊邇、有現貨預備交割者、頗不乏人、故市氣更形鬆濫、遠期以賣氣亦盛、亦見跟落、觀目下情形、因此洋麥鬆廉之比例、前途恐常不利多方也、結果本月份跌九分、二月份跌五分、三月份跌六分、四月份跌八分、現麥因標準大跌、廠胃平平、各檔開價又落四五分、開山東歸德明光麥三元八角四分、由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日來源共到四十餘號、貨共七八千石、而銷塲因昨市一番猛跌、各貨似頗跌透、稍有動動、本街有銷、客路亦有青島帮續辦六七百包、故大勢轉呈定中帶緊之局、如晚稻及各厚粳價除高料者平定、其中市貨已有提起數分矣、杜尖及變陰元等各花色、亦並見轉定也、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地到貨三十餘艘、市上各貨去胃白粳短價略交、薄稻變元平淡、各尖呆滯、市價白粳高貨價跌一角、中次小一二角、薄稻變元羊杜尖亦小角許、埠客尖疲象、</p>

<p>昨日黄豆市頗緊張、因油餅　　提、且値各路來源不湧、底積日鬆、貨户　意堅緊、故賣買雙方心思一致看漲、統市廠家及内地辦去大連四平街豆三十餘車、大連西城豆二千餘包、牛莊白眉豆一車、歸德豆六百餘包、沙市豆五百包、蚌埠豆及新安鎭豆一車外、又本街及内地採去漢口乍豆二千四百餘包、</p>
<p>芝蔴洋莊去路續暢、昨沙遜洋行有一千噸口胃、祇辦進六百噸、行情復出十元大關、計十元零二角、怡和辦二百噸、即裝價亦十元零二角、錄江帮午後辦進一百噸、價祇十元、現貨東洋帮銷路不淡、故市仍堅穩、</p>

<p>青鉛交易、向以黄丹廠油漆公司以及錫紙廠鉛字房等爲最暢達、茶棧帮自改用鋅皮之後、對於青鉛所作之鉛箱、亦頻見减少、是以其出路殊不及先前熱閙、近幾月來、市上因供過於求、趨勢極覺萎靡、雖迭經同業竭力設法及推銷、但終以環境惡劣、故其實交依然難見起色、茲將各市商况分錢於下、</p>
<p>（洋鉛）近來到頻見裝來、故堆積在外棧者、十分充斥、惟本埠客帮生意不見動静、而本街廠家點綴亦十分鮮少、是以市情之清静、極有難於形容之概、雖邇來同業竭力推廣招徠、無如年盡歲底、銀根緊急、終無大批交易、行情每担估十五元二角、半比前殊少變遷、聞少許買賣、行開十五元四五角不等、</p>
<p>（土鉛）雖到貨不多、但出路有限、是以市勢亦十分萎呆、行情每担估十四元七八角、倘另售及門莊生意、行開十五元光景、連日交易祇有零星、殊少躉批、聞月内漢口方面、尙有大批現貨、可以裝來、是以近來本埠人心、極覺衰弱、預料行情方面、將來恐有趨軟傾向、</p>

<h3 id="c268">愛護異類應從愛護同類做起　　行安· <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>人類的行爲，總是矛盾的。醫如現在，一方面有人在拚命地製造飛機大砲毒瓦斯，聲嘶力竭地喊着殺！殺！殺！另一方面却有人在熱心地提倡動物保護，仁愛地對着動物表示同情。</p>
<p>然而矛盾雖則矛盾，今日的世界，儘管有人手中抱着一顆大炸彈，對準着和平之神的腦袋抛去：有心的人們，却不妨把自已的慈悲的本性發揮出來。難道别人殘酷，我們也得跟他殘酷起來不成？隔壁的王二好行壞事，這邊的張五，正該行點善事去感化他。不然，這個人世間眞要變成地獄了！</p>
<p>不過，自稱爲萬物之靈的人類，現在要對那些久被我們視若蒭狗的動物，</p>
<p>加以憐惜，加以保護，這未始不是人類的一種覺悟：然而這種覺悟，發動在目前這弱肉强食的世界，實嫌過早。蓋現在的人類，對同類旦不能互愛，遑論愛及異類？故我以爲保護動物，在今日，只不過是我們人類的一種想，離實現期還很遠。我們若要使這種理想實現，先决的條件，應從同類相愛這一點做起。</p>
<p>這是一件不可否認的事實，人類界自相殘殺的現象，比任何動物界來得厲害。國與國，族與族，其仇視之心，固顯而易見：卽同一國人，同一族人，也常對立而不相容。説小些，甲家與乙家，因小故而肇大禍者，並非罕見之事。</p>
<p>卽親如父子兄弟夫婦，其骨肉之情，該是如何深厚；然一旦反目，亦每不惜出以最後的手叚相應付。這是人類的一種惡劣的天性。</p>
<p>人類因爲有這一種惡劣的天性，故對於同類，便不能相愛，以一個對同類尙不知相愛的人類，要他們來施恩及於異類的動物，對動物加以保護，實不可能。故我們以爲人類果有仁慈之懷，願對動物加以愛護，第一步，宜由改造人類的本性着手：</p>

<p>剛跨進大學敎授某先生的家，便看見他和他的妻兩口兒對坐在一隻長方形的書桌旁邊，忙着在編寫某先生授課的講義。一種悲愁的神情，表現在大學敎授的臉龐上。縐着眉，愁着臉，似乎有什麽心事似的。某先生一看見我，便把手裏的筆兒擱在書桌上，堆着滿臉的笑容來招待我，他的妻也忙着取出糖果來給我吃。『剛纔從什麽地方來的？學校有什麽特别的事發生麽？』某先生開始這樣的問我。因爲先生没有請假也没有上課堂、我疑心先生是病了！故此特來探望。』我無聊地這樣回答了，惹得大家都不禁笑了起來。某先生和我從學校的事談到個人的生活狀况。他用着一種很老腔的語調告訴我：</p>
<p>『大學敎授是一種名義動聽而實窮苦的招牌。費了無限大的精神，祇換得來了微薄的生活之資。你想想：日間要上課堂，晚上又得編講義，看學生的課卷：每天晚上總是到半夜三更才得睡覺，簡直連屁股都坐痛了。爲要把地位弄隱當，還得週旋學校當局，聯絡學生；</p>
<p>那種精神上的痛苦，簡直是難以言宣！</p>
<p>何况現在的生活，是毫無保障地，時時刻刻在起恐慌呢！因爲學校的薪水不發，弄得這兩天來連車錢都没有，所以，</p>
<p>今天你們的功課，只好缺席了！你看現在的所謂大學敎授！」</p>
<p>某先生一口氣講到了這裏，他的臉上彷彿是給一重愁雲遮着，顯得特别的黯然！他的妻也不勝唏噓似的。</p>
<p>突如地一陣狂風，從外間吹進室内，把兩扇門給吹開了。這時，陽光已經隱藏了，不在剛纔的石階上。已經是將近傍晚的時分了。於是我辭别某某先生和他的妻。</p>
<p>在歸途上慢步着，還懷着無限惆悵似的心情。某先生今天之所以缺課，原來如此！呵！大學敎授的悲哀呀！</p>

<p>明月在天，人影在地，靜悄悄地獨自從馬路上歸來，走過小小的院子，似乎還不捨這樣的月夜，石化了似的依着牆角，呆望着萬里無雲的靑雲，心中的萬般愁思彷彿一時也消滌殆盡，慢慢地看着自已的影子從脚跟升展開去，好像感到一陣寒意，才乏力地上樓。</p>
<p>黑暗中從角道摸到房門口，意外地門開直着，猛的扭動電燈關鍵，床上睡</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>着老友微。床側小几上放着一杯茶，那烟盤裏的半襲烟蒂還嬝嬝地升着一絲絲的靑烟，閙鐘上恰正指着兩點鐘，我猛然憶起今晚我邀他來的，想下星期日偷一天的空閒，作短距離的旅行。自已近來對於生活眞是感到非常的厭倦，每天都像失眠症患者似的精神恍惚，但是絕對没有病的象徵、自家兒當然知道自家兒的心病的，然而知道僅僅是知道罷了，可没有能力將自已的精神奮作起來，一星期前，曾消極地每夜把自已沉浸在跳舞裏，起初對於那些熱情的音樂，似乎很愜意，每一個曲子奏起的時候，我抱了蛇一樣的女人把懊惱消失在内的氣氛中。然而以後就没有那樣的效力了，坐了兩整夜没有跳一個曲子，這自然引起了許多驚訝和卑鄙的目光投射到我身來了，於是更進一層的厭惡。無聊耐的想約微來離開這腥臭的大都市，雖僅僅是廿四小時的一個禮拜六。</p>
<p>可是昨晚睡得遲一點，開了房中的前窗，覺得我踏到了上海以來没有見過這般月夜，就獨自披了秋大衣無目的踏月夜遊，走過了許多幽僻的小路，月光被路旁楓樹的葉子篩成一個個圓圈，就那樣數着前進，歸來也在午夜已後了，一上床郤得了個甜密的夢。自家兒又知道得明白的，我在追求新的刺激，最好把我的生活送　萬花簡中，這樣我可以每天快活的過着日子。今晚看見月光從窗檽中漏進來，又獨自個兒出門了，郤忘了約着微來徵求他出遊同意的。</p>
<p>慢慢的走進床邊，微驚醒了，翻起身來握住我的手，我知道他將責問我的失約，但是被我冰冷的手，變了他的問句：</p>
<p>「從什麽地方回來啊？丨」</p>
<p>「看月亮。」</p>
<p>微是最明白我的，這樣的回答已足够他滿意了，他就不再詢問這些，直談到我約他的原因。</p>
<p>「我想禮拜六到那裏去旅行一次。」</p>
<p>「好啊！」</p>
<p>微往往這樣鼓助我的，友情的偉大就在此，他滔滔不絕的把附近上海的名</p>
<p>勝説丁許多好處，雖然我明知道他没有曉得這末詳細。</p>
<p>「好罷，我們到無錫去。」</p>
<p>「好！星期六乘夜車去，足足有一天的時間。而且·····」他笑着説：「你近來太消沉了，應該找新的刺激，這星期我們旅行，下星期我還有新的花樣···</p>
<p>·····」</p>
<p>「跳舞塲罷了！」我搶着回答。</p>
<p>「哼：那些女人太使人討厭，總之，我有好地方去，保君滿意，要知道這是年靑人的煩悶啊！」</p>
<p>最後一句我附在耳畔輕微地説着，</p>
<p>我不由地笑了出來。</p>
<h3 id="c271">焚燬毒物　夢若· <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>前日淞滬警備司令部，把歷次破獲烟案所没收的毒物，一齊當衆焚燬，這未始不是一件痛决人心的舉動。中國的不振原因殊多：但人民身體的病弱，實是個最大的致命傷。今後要是這個致命傷不能除去，中國恐怕永遠也不會抬頭。而使人民身體陷於病弱的根源，首推毒物。政府當局，有見及此，故近來對於查禁毒物一事，雷厲風行，不稍寛鬆。我們只要一看幾月來，上海接二連三地破獲製造毒物機關，須知道當局者所下决心的一斑。行見不久毒物絕跡；人民身體，漸趨康健：整個國家，亦隨之走上强盛之路。</p>
<p>可是事情却不容你過於樂觀。我國民受毒物的禍害，由來已久，非一朝一夕所能禁絕。蓋吸食者旣已成癮，没有堅强的意志，斷難戒除；而製造者又每因貪圖厚利，不惜以身家生命作冒險的嘗試。事實是排在我們眼前的，本市在焚燬毒物後一兩天，當局者不是又破獲了幾椿毒物的案件嗎？這正是毒物不易禁絕的一個很好的説明。</p>
<p>還有一點，也是禁止毒物前途的大阻礙。那便是少數外國人，常籍其國籍爲護符，以其租界爲安全地，秘密組織毒物製造機關，大批出産毒物，以禍害我國民。他們的背景旣大，組織又密，</p>
<p>規模又廣，製造販運亦甚靈巧，破獲自非易事。卽偶而給我們發　了，他們也不受我國法律的裁制：欲儆效尤，亦不可得。</p>
<p>然而我們對於禁絕毒物之舉，就灰心了嗎？那又不然。我們對於禁絕毒物，困難雖多；我們還得想法子，把所有的困難克服，以達到我們的目的。這就有待於當局者的一番努力了！</p>

<p>丨丨流浪人是没有家的。</p>
<p>我不愛在旁人面前提起了家，同時也更不願意獨個自想起了家，這並不是我要忘去自　「飲水思源」的家，因爲實際上在過着流浪生活的人，卽使懷念着熱戀着它也是徒然的事。</p>
<p>所以，我唯有這麽地説。</p>
<p>流浪底生活是最够人厭倦的，人間世哀傷苦痛的體騐是尤其使得每一個游子的心感覺到流浪底不幸回憶到温柔安適的家，在那花草爭妍的春光之下，「故鄉無限好」丨誰個流浪者不想起了家的可愛？在那野綠正濃的夏日，那種「綠蔭垂釣」「迎風弄笛」的清興又誰能抹得去？到了秋天，那又是高爽的天氣，</p>
<p>輕薄的白雲　落葉閃莎的哀音，更强有力地波動了流浪人的鄉思喲！白雲深處的故鄕之家呵！</p>
<p>然而，正因了自已對於家的懷念太深，家的生活太安逸因此怕想起了家，年耆的父親，親愛的兄弟，骨肉的恩愛是深深地劃上了心之深處，再一面，小資産家庭的破落，家中入不敷出難以維持的境况，一切使我憂鬰，悒悶，爲了太牽掛了家私不能脱離了現實生活的羈絆而歸家，因此便索性不願想起家，</p>
<p>不願談起家了！卽使懷念着想戀着它也是徒然的事。</p>
<p>自家旣然不能設法解除家裏困難的生活，又不能離回了流浪的生活回到家裏過着天倫之樂的親愛温柔的生活。永遠地過着那麽悲痛的流浪的生活，荏苒的四年了，水樣底流年。自從那年脱離了家起。</p>

<h3 id="c274">中國歷史上標準偉人　　愚公· <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>以前有某刊物呌人選舉女偉人，現在又有某香烟公司呌人選舉歷史上標準偉人，前一次是連活着的人都在候選之列，這一次是只有死人有份兒；前一次是娘兒們出主張，而且是娘兒們自已投票，這一次是商人求利在推銷他的香烟，動機旣然不同，性質自然各異。前一次女偉人的選舉，在鼓勵女同胞上進這一點上是有相當的價値，這一次目的却是使學生在得到獎學金，已經失去了選舉的意義了。</p>
<p>選舉本身旣然没有意義，横豎是近於「借題發揮」的事，這且不去論牠，只是在候選人名單上，却未免令人看來眞是怪有趣的玩意兒。</p>
<p>决定這歷史上標準偉人候選人名單的先生，我眞偑服他的高見，你看他對於中國人的一般弱點是如何的觀察得清清楚楚？作推背圖燒餅歌的劉伯温，這在破除迷信的現代眼光看來，一文不値，可是他是中國人在這動亂的時代最崇拜的一個所以他是標準的偉人。求外援哭秦庭的申包胥，有什麽了不得的偉大，可是自從九一八以來，中國人是在希望金元帝國主義的「路見不平　刀相助」</p>
<p>，和乞援於自救不暇的國際聯盟理事會，申包胥正是歷史上這一種典型人物，</p>
<p>所以他亦是標準的偉人。</p>
<p>然而，在候選人名單裏頭，却又有令人莫名其土地堂的編派，如周瑜明明是東吳大都　，却在「文臣」之列，諸葛亮與曾國藩竟編入「聖哲」之門。周郎大槪是會聽琴顧曲的綠故害了他，所以不配作武將，這可還有道理。諸葛亮與曾國藩怎麽變成了「聖哲」的標準偉人了呢！還有張作霖與簡照南竟成了「近代英　」這又不知何所根據？簡照南是中國香烟大王，這與香烟公司本身有關係還有話説；張作霖成了「近代英豪」是認他軍閥做得有功於民國的嗎？大槪只有這點理由了。假使北洋軍閥ＸＸＸ已經「作古」，我想他一定也是「現代英豪」的偉人無疑。</p>

<p>（甲）建築工程上應用木材須儘先參用杉木　按照建築上設計製圖慣例，</p>
<p>以洋松有整齊之尺寸，有標準之强度，普通木材，除椿木必須用圓杉木外，什九均用洋松，以其便於計算耳，第洋松究係洋貨，多用一塊，卽多流一塊洋松價値之金錢於國外，吾國國産杉木，祇要能承受同一載重之力者，均可代替而參用之，卽較大尺寸之料，如亦能改用杉木最好，設遇特種情形，勢有不得不引用洋松時，則仍用洋松，較之全用舶來品，所勝多矣。</p>
<p>（乙）實地試騐杉木之强度　歐西各國，對於材料之强度，莫不有精密試騐之標準，以供設計上之引用，吾國工業幼稚，雖有材料試騐之設備，國産杉木，未經實地試騐，對於彈性强度，破碎强度，彈性係數等，尙乏確當之標準，當此推行國産杉木之際，亟應試騐，以便設計配料上之引用也。</p>
<p>（丙）組織改用圓杉木設計研究會　杉木强度，旣實地試騐矣，尤須將向例用方柱體製圖設計方法，改用圓柱體方法，明定標準，以便利於實行，</p>
<p>惟此種標準，非集思廣益，公同研究，未可貿然改革，故先須組織洋松改用杉木設計研究會以討論之。</p>
<p>（四）今後杉木商應改良之點</p>
<p>（甲）改喡碼爲量徑定價　第二條所述，杉木估價，對於計算上，有太複雜之缺點、易令用户捨此就彼，若能改用量徑定價，俾與設計家以簡捷之估價，自必樂而用之矣。</p>
<p>（乙）購置鋸木機鋸售各式裝修應用木料　用洋松鋸截裝修，每多翹裂之弊，用户頗有知之者，用杉木以製裝修，可免此病，然苦於費工損料，殊非經濟之道，如杉木商能購機鋸售現成木料，以備各界之選購，一則躉批鋸截，可省工資，二則損料之尺寸，鋸各别之花色，母須損料，對已對人，兩有裨益也。</p>
<p>（五）對於産木區域當局方面應負責剿匪以通暢來源</p>
<p>嘗聞諸業木者云，建廣西木産地，均在山路崎嶇，匪徒出没之區、交通曲折，非老練之山客，頗難深入其地，每有購成之排，運在中途，被匪刦之而去。勒索巨欵，職此之故，山客常居奇其貨，不肯賤售，此點亦屬推行國産木之障碍，亟望産木區域之當局者，設法殱滅匪徒，負責護運，一面更望免除雜税，庶幾來源無阻，成本减輕，可暢銷全國矣。</p>
<p>以上五條，實爲推行國産杉木各界所當注意之點，此外洋松每年漏巵之大，諒愛國人土，稍具血性者，讀之定能有動乎中，知所取捨，鄙人不學無文，</p>
<p>以一時之感於心而行於筆，固不暇顧及於修詞也，惟望海内同胞，切實推行國産杉木，並請政府，實施提倡，頒令全國工程界，應用木材，儘先改用國貨，</p>
<p>是鄙人所馨香祝禱者也，行見杉木需用浩繁，木行林立，如春筍之怒放，雖不能收還已往之利權，而每年進口入超之大减，可期而待矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang's Admonition Speech <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Hopes for All Military and Political Leaders to Pay Attention to Rural Construction</p>
<p>Inspects the Hubei Provincial Government and Receives Wang Shuchang and Others</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang attended the expanded weekly memorial service at the headquarters at 9 a.m. on the 8th, attended by Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, Yang Yongtai, Xia Douyin, and senior military and political figures, senior officials from various agencies, heads of various party committees, heads of public security bureaus, and presidents of major and secondary schools, etc. In a solemn atmosphere, Chiang, in military uniform, arrived and, after leading the ceremony, gave an admonition speech, the general gist of which was that in Hankou in the 21st year, eighteen administrative guidelines were promulgated, some of which have been implemented, and some have not. This inspection of Hankou revealed that the municipal administration and police were quite good, and the roads were clean and passable, but there were some neglected areas, such as the Liu family temple in Qiaokou, where poor people lived in unsanitary conditions and lacked education, urgently requiring measures to improve their living conditions. The Chinese people have always emphasized appearances and neglected reality. In the future, attention should be paid to areas that are not noticed. Now that everything is in place, it is hoped that continued efforts will be made. It is also hoped that all military and political leaders will pay attention to rural construction. To strengthen the people, teach them to work hard, and to enrich them, teach them to work hard. With the accumulation of extensive labor, what cannot be accomplished? If money is always needed, it only shows that one is incapable of doing things. The meeting adjourned at 10 a.m., and Chiang immediately went to visit Luojia Mountain.</p>
<p>(8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang crossed the river from Hankou to Wuchang headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 8th to attend the expanded memorial week.

All were dressed in prescribed khaki uniforms with command swords, appearing full of spirit. After Ma Zhao, the chairman of the ceremony, led the salute, the entire audience recited the general's will in unison, followed by an admonition speech by Chiang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, chairman of the Military Affairs Commission's Beiping Branch,</p>
<p>came south this time because of the death of his mother-in-law to offer condolences. Also, having been away from the department for a long time, he needed to personally inspect the department's affairs.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the trip south, he met with Chairman Chiang. Since Chiang was in Hankou, he went to Hankou first to report on important military and political affairs in North China. He will arrive in Beijing on the 12th of this month. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang sternly ordered all provinces that due to the collapse of rural areas,</p>
<p>no further burdens should be added to land taxes. If undertakings are to be established, methods must be found elsewhere. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian reported at the memorial week on the 8th that Chairman Chiang's arrival in Hankou was to plan the suppression of bandits, and everyone should not listen to rumors.

<p>Chiang's Telegram Orders Provinces to Implement</p>
<h3 id="e2">Mandatory Labor Service for the People <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang telegraphed the chairmen of ten provinces, namely Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shaanxi, and Gansu, on the 8th, stating that as winter is approaching and it is the slack season for agriculture, it is imperative to make the people utilize their abilities in a timely manner and implement the mandatory labor service system for the people to complete all urgent local work in various provinces. (1) The construction of roads that need to be repaired in various parts of the province,</p>
<p>the dredging of rivers, the digging of ponds, and the repair of dikes, etc.,</p>
<p>should be promptly determined for the first phase of construction plans from this winter to next spring, and the nature of the tasks should be distinguished, determining which tasks should adopt the method of universal mandatory labor service for the people, and which tasks should adopt the method of assigning labor levies, comprehensively considering and formulating concrete plans for implementation within a time limit. (2) Each province should actively encourage people to plant trees and forests, and prohibit burning mountains, as previously instructed by telegram. Starting from next spring, all provinces that have established nurseries should immediately cultivate as many seedlings of various trees suitable for the soil of each province as possible, and distribute them to various counties for planting. Provinces that have not established nurseries should establish them before next spring. All roadsides of highways opened up by various provinces must be planted with trees, and the planting must be completed within two years. From this winter, various provinces should also dispatch personnel to various places to investigate. If there is any mountain burning in any county,</p>
<p>the county magistrate and district chiefs should be punished, as those who do not enforce</p>
<p>and supervise strictly will be warned. The above two items must be strictly followed by all provinces, especially the mandatory labor service of the people, which is the initial work of training and organizing the people. Guanzi said, "If you want to be rich, teach the people to work hard." Now our country is in extreme difficulty and the people are impoverished. All administrative officials of the provinces must make the people endure hardship and learn to work hard, correcting their laziness, and also make the people aware that being brave in public</p>
<p>service is where their private interests lie, so that they are all happy to serve, and then the foundation of the lower levels of society can be strengthened, and the future of national revival can be hoped for. This should not be taken lightly, and especially not merely</p>
<p>with a paper order or a single event to perfunctorily fulfill one's duty. There must be thorough methods, implemented year by year, established as a precedent, and developed into a habit. When it has been done for a long time, and the people have benefited from it, they will automatically follow it without the need for supervision, which is in line with the original intention of establishing a fixed service system. This committee chairman will use the effectiveness of the provinces in handling these matters as a basis for assessing political achievements. It is still expected that all will follow the instructions and report the situation. Zhong Zhengqi's Seal, (Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>Legislative Yuan Passes</p>
<h3 id="e13">Various Articles Concerning the Judicial Yuan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Name of the Supreme Court to Be Abolished</p>
<p>Continued Review of the Examination Yuan This Morning</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 2:30 PM on the 8th, the Legislative Yuan continued to discuss the draft constitution, with 64 members in attendance, including Chuan Bingchang.</p>
<p>Chairman Sun Ke announced the opening of the meeting and reviewed Article 84 of Chapter Four, Section Four, changed to Article 77: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest organ of the central government exercising judicial power." Dai Xiujun argued that the powers of the Judicial Yuan should be specified in this article. The chairman also agreed and, incorporating the opinions of the various committees, proposed an amendment, adding at the end of the original article, "Handling civil, criminal, and administrative litigation, disciplinary actions against public officials, and judicial administration." There was no objection, and the amendment was passed on the second reading. Article 85, changed to Article 78: "The Judicial Yuan shall have one president, with a term of four years, who may be re-elected." The second paragraph, "The President of the Judicial Yuan is responsible to the National Assembly." The review committee member Lin Bin and others proposed an amendment to the former item of this article, which was read: "The Judicial Yuan shall have one president, with a term of eight years, appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan." Lin Bin also reported on the amendment process.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhihan seconded Lin's proposal, but still changed the eight years to four years,</p>
<p>and added the word "proposed" above the word "consent." Huang Youchang also advocated a term of four years, because there is a special article providing for the protection of judges. Cheng Zhongxing said that the position of President of the Judicial Yuan, if it is a political appointment, should be the same as the presidents of the Legislative, Examination, and Control Yuans, with a term of four years. If it is a judge, it should be a lifetime appointment, and eight years is not appropriate. Wei Tingsheng said that extending the term of the President of the Judicial Yuan is to protect judges, but since the Department of Judicial Administration is now under the Judicial Yuan, the Judicial Yuan also has the meaning of an administrative official, and giving it an eight-year term would be a great drawback. The chairman submitted the opinions of all parties to a vote.</p>
<p>As a result, the former item of this article was amended to "The Judicial Yuan shall have one president, with a term of four years, appointed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan." The second item was still passed on the second reading according to the original proposal. Article 86, "During the adjournment of the National Assembly, when the President of the Judicial Yuan leaves office due to unforeseen circumstances, the members of the National Assembly shall elect an acting president," was deleted. Article 87, changed to Article 79: "The Judicial Yuan shall have a Supreme Court, a Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, and a Department of Judicial Administration." The review committee member Lin Bin and others also proposed an amendment to this article, which was read: "The Judicial Yuan shall have a Trial Division, an Inspection Office, a Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, and a Department of Judicial Administration," and Lin Bin explained that the Supreme Court was abolished</p>
<p>and merged with the Judicial Yuan, in accordance with the teachings of the Premier. The Trial Division and Inspection Office are established within the Supreme Court, so they are still established in the amendment to avoid affecting the organization of the judicial organs after the constitution is promulgated in the future. Shi Shangkuan said that it is inappropriate to change the Supreme Court to a Trial Division and Inspection Office, and the name of the Trial Division is especially absurd. He advocated maintaining the original proposal. Huang Youchang said that the military Trial Division is a step backward, and supported Shi's motion. Xie Shoukang also advocated maintaining the original proposal.</p>
<p>The chairman explained that there are three types of Judicial Yuan systems: (1)</p>
<p>The Judicial Yuan has a president, and there is also a president of the Supreme Court and a Minister of Judicial Administration. This system has been tested by the National Government for a long time, but the President of the Judicial Yuan seems to be idle. (2) The President of the Judicial Yuan is also the President of the Supreme Court, and also manages judicial administration. The Premier tested this system in Guangdong. Xu Qian, as the President of the Dali Court, also served as the head of the Ministry of Justice. (3) The President of the Judicial Yuan concurrently serves as the President of the Supreme Court, and another Minister of Judicial Administration is established. Lin's amendment adopts this method. According to the teachings of the Premier, the Judicial Yuan is the Supreme Court. Since it is the Supreme Court, and there is also the Judicial Yuan to govern it, is this not a contradiction? Moreover, the President of the Judicial Yuan does not concurrently serve as the head of judicial administration, and is only in a supervisory position, which can achieve a unified and consistent judicial and administrative effect, and there is no drawback of unclear judicial and administrative powers. The spirit of Lin's proposal is roughly like this. Peng Yangguang advocated adding an Administrative Review Committee to this article to manage administrative litigation. Zhong</p>
<p>Tianxin did not agree with Lin's proposal, and advocated deleting the four characters "Supreme Court" in the original proposal and adding the word "concurrently." The chairman submitted the opinions of the various committee members to a vote, and it was amended to "The Judicial Yuan shall have a Public Officials Disciplinary Committee and a Department of Judicial Administration, and passed on the third reading. Article 88, changed to Article 80: "The President of the Supreme Court, the Chairman of the Public Officials Disciplinary Committee, and the Minister of Judicial Administration shall all be nominated by the President of the Judicial Yuan in accordance with the law and appointed and dismissed by the President." The review committee member Lin Bin and others advocated deleting "President of the Supreme Court" and changing it to "Presidents of the Trial Divisions and Chief Prosecutors of the Inspection Office of the Judicial Yuan." Shi Weihuan opposed the new proposal and advocated deleting the number "President of the Supreme Court" in the original proposal and adding the word "member" after "Chairman of the Public Officials Disciplinary Committee," so it was amended on the second reading according to Shi's proposal. Article 89, changed to Article 81: "Matters concerning amnesty, commutation of sentences, and restoration of rights shall be submitted by the President of the Judicial Yuan to the President for implementation in accordance with the law." Chen Ruxuan advocated adding, "However, the above submission shall not be made regarding the judgments of impeachment cases." Zhao Chen, Dai Xiujun, and Lou Tongsun opposed it, saying that Chen's old affairs were being brought up again, as Chen had proposed adding it when discussing Article 41, but was immediately rejected, so he proposed it again when discussing this article. Jiao Yitang and Lu Zhiyi supported Chen's proposal, saying that officials should be strictly governed, and the people should be treated with leniency, so they advocated adding a proviso. The chairman submitted Chen's proposal to a vote, and few people supported it, so it was still passed on the second reading according to the original proposal. Article 90, "The court shall accept civil, criminal, administrative, and all other litigation and non-litigation matters in accordance with the law." Before this article was amended in Article 77, Lin Bin, Lu Zhiyi, and Zhou Yizhi advocated moving it to after Article 77 and changing it to Article 78 to clearly define the functions of the Judicial Yuan. However, because Article 77 was amended and passed, this article was deleted. Article 91, changed to Article 82: "The Supreme Court has the power to uniformly interpret laws and orders." Only the</p>
<p>number "Supreme Court" was changed to "Judicial Yuan," and the rest was passed on the second reading according to the original proposal. Article 92, changed to Article 83: "Judges shall independently adjudicate in accordance with the law." The original proposal was passed on the second reading. Article 93, changed to Article 84: "Judges shall not be dismissed unless they are subject to criminal or disciplinary punishment, or a declaration of interdiction of property, and shall not be suspended, transferred, or have their salaries reduced without legal basis." Shi Weihuan advocated adding "Public Officials Disciplinary Committee" after the word "judge," but it was opposed, so the original proposal was still passed on the second reading. Article 94, changed to Article 85: "The organization of the Judicial Yuan and the organization of the court shall be determined by law." The chairman proposed that "and the court</p>
<p>" be changed to "and the courts at all levels." There was no objection, and the amendment was passed on the second reading. All articles in the fourth section have been passed, and it is already 5:30. The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the meeting will continue at 9 AM on the 9th.</p>
<p>Attached is the fourth section of the articles that were passed on the second reading after the amendment:</p>
<p>Section Four, the Judicial Yuan, Article 77: The Judicial Yuan is the highest organ of the central government exercising judicial power, handling the adjudication of civil, criminal, and administrative litigation, disciplinary actions against public officials, and judicial administration. Article 78: The Judicial Yuan shall have one president, with a term of four years, who shall be appointed and dismissed by the President with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The President of the Judicial Yuan shall be responsible to the National Assembly. Article 79: The Judicial Yuan shall have a Public Officials Disciplinary Committee and a Department of Judicial Administration. Article 80: The Chairman and members of the Public Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Minister of Judicial Administration shall all be nominated by the President of the Judicial Yuan in accordance with the law and appointed and dismissed by the President. Article 81: Matters concerning amnesty, commutation of sentences, and restoration of rights shall be</p>
<p>submitted by the President of the Judicial Yuan to the President for implementation in accordance with the law. Article 82: The Judicial Yuan has the power to uniformly interpret laws and orders. Article 83: Judges shall independently adjudicate in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Article 84: Judges shall not be dismissed unless they are subject to criminal or disciplinary punishment or a declaration of interdiction of property, and shall not be suspended, transferred, or have their salaries reduced without legal basis. Article 85: The organization of the Judicial Yuan and the organization of the courts at all levels shall be determined by law.</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Spanish Civil Unrest is Settled恒· <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>I mentioned a few days ago that the left-wing parties in the Spanish Parliament, due to their declining influence, could no longer legally restrain the right-wing. Therefore, they were plotting a riot to intimidate the right-wing. Unexpectedly, because of the inclusion of three members of the Catholic Party (also known as the Popular Action Party) in Lerroux's cabinet, it incited the left-wing to riot again, and the Catalan provincial government even declared independence. The severity of the situation, the surging public sentiment, and the anxiety of the people were almost the same as when the Spanish king abdicated in April 1931. Those who paid attention to the situation in Spain were also hard-pressed to predict what the future would hold. Who would have thought that in just a short time, the independent government of Catalonia would be crushed by the government army's artillery fire, and many important leaders would also surrender. At the same time, sporadic riots in various places were also gradually suppressed. The situation and the environment were like a theatrical performance, and the ease with which revolutionary actions were destroyed could not have been greater than this time.</p>
<p>However, the failure of this left-wing revolution was also expected. What was particularly unexpected was the speed of its failure. This was something I had not anticipated. The left-wing in Spain is divided into many parties, and their proposals and actions are not only mutually inconsistent but also contradictory. For example, Azaña was originally the leader of the Republican Action Party, but after stepping down last winter, he began to cooperate with the Socialist Party to form the Republican Left. This was a temporary expedient measure to cope with the oppression of the right-wing, and its momentum would not last long. Moreover, if the independence movement in Catalonia had been slightly successful, whether these two factions could always cooperate harmoniously would also be a big question. This is one of the reasons why the left-wing revolution was difficult to win. Furthermore, the syndicalist movement in Spain is no less powerful than the Socialist Party. For example, Barcelona, the only large city in Catalonia, is almost the stronghold of syndicalists. Their proposed actions are the same in nature as those of the anarchist party. Therefore, in Spain, there is little distinction between these two names. What they hate is the power of the state. Because they hate power, their actions are often without focus or discipline, scattered and uncoordinated. At the same time, they are also deeply suspicious and wary of the collectivist states of the Socialist and Communist parties. Therefore, although they may temporarily come together and echo each other out of need, their tendency to spoil things more than accomplish them has long been predetermined. Finally, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party also have different dreams in the same bed and harbor different ambitions. With such a complicated collection of parties, even if the riot succeeds for a time, it will not benefit the stability of the Spanish political situation. Therefore, the inevitable failure of this action was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>According to the European telegrams received the day before yesterday, the left-wing in Spain launched this uprising because the Catholic Party had a tendency to restore the monarchy. This kind of propaganda by the left-wing did not start today. Since the election of the right-leaning parliament last winter, the left-wing has been accusing the Catholic Party of this crime. However, judging from the facts, this is not entirely true. Before the revolution in Spain, the Catholic Church was indeed often the right arm of the royal family. However, since the revolution, the abandonment of restoration by Catholics and the formation of political parties to participate in politics were actually mandated by the Pope. Moreover, the party has repeatedly stated its support for the republic, even to the point of losing the favor of the monarchists. From this perspective, the restoration argument seems to be an exaggeration. However, it is undeniable that the Catholic Party is the most right-leaning political party in Spain today. What it advocates is power politics and a unified nation.</p>
<p>What it opposes is the separatist movement, Marxism, and the trade union movement. Now, in order to effectively implement these kinds of proposals, the oppression of the left-wing will inevitably become increasingly severe.</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy Readies Its Formation</p>

<p>Admiral Nagano Succeeds as Commander of the Combined Fleet</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval flag officer meeting to review regular naval promotions is scheduled to begin on the 24th, after the completion of the grand maneuvers on the 23rd. In addition to the promotion of 11 rear admirals and 31 commodores, the scope of changes will be quite extensive as the nation reorganizes its lineup during this extraordinary time. These changes are currently under investigation by Naval Minister Osumi, and although the details of the proposed changes are still unclear, the general expectations are as follows: Admiral Suetsugu Nobumasa, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the First Fleet, will be appointed Military Councillor; Admiral Nagano Osami, Commander-in-Chief of the Yokosuka Naval District, will be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the First Fleet. As for the replacement of the Yokosuka Naval District Commander-in-Chief, it is expected that Vice Admiral Takahashi Sankichi, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Fleet, or Vice Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, Commander-in-Chief of the Sasebo Naval District, will be transferred. If Vice Admiral Takahashi takes this position, then Vice Admiral Imamura Nobujiro, Commander-in-Chief of the Third Fleet, will succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the Second Fleet. His successor will be Vice Admiral Hyakutake Gengo, Commander of the Maizuru Naval Station. Vice Admiral Hyakutake's successor will be Vice Admiral Matsuyama Shigeru, from the Military Regulations Inspection Division. Rear Admiral Kobayashi Seizaburo, Commander of the Naval Forces in Manchuria, will be promoted to Vice Admiral and transferred to another post. His successor will be Rear Admiral Tsuda Shizue, Director of the Third Department of the Naval General Staff. (Telegram dated the 8th)</p>
<p>Italy and France Seek Naval Coordination</p>
<h3 id="e16">Impact on the Far East Situation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Promotes Anglo-American Cooperation Against Japan</p>
<p>Yamamoto Declares Intention to Tear Up Treaty</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press has learned that U.S. government officials consider the new coordination between Italy and France to be the greatest force for stabilizing the situation in recent times. Premier Mussolini's speech in Milan on Saturday stated that the effects of this new understanding are not only related to the European political situation but also have a significant impact on the Far East. What Washington is paying attention to is whether this coordination can find a solution to the naval competition between Italy and France in the Mediterranean. The naval construction of both countries is causing great instability to Britain's naval position. According to non-official sources, there are rumors here that the naval issue in the Mediterranean may be resolved, so Britain may not need to add warships for the time being. Well-informed sources believe that this may allow Britain and the United States to cooperate against Japan in next year's naval conference,</p>
<p>maintaining the original ratio, or else Britain may combine with Japan, and at the same time demand an increase in battleships. (National Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Rear Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese representative for the preliminary naval talks in London, passed through New York today,</p>
<p>heading to London, expressing that Japan will soon abolish the Washington Treaty. Yamamoto declared, "The decision to abolish the Washington Treaty must be made by the Japanese government. However, from the standpoint of a naval officer, I believe that the notification of abolition will be issued soon. I believe that if naval powers can cooperate sincerely and without prejudice, any difficulties that all parties agree upon can be resolved." Yamamoto added that if the London talks do not reach an agreement, he believes that discussions should be held again next year. He opposes the cessation of progress after the breakdown of the London talks. (National Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Mr. Yamamoto, the Japanese representative who arrived safely in the United States,</p>
<p>made the following statement to a group of journalists:</p>
<p>The Japanese government will soon notify the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of the abolition of the Washington Treaty, but the timing of the notification has not yet been decided. The Japanese government will also propose a new disarmament method at the preliminary consultations in London. This new method requires all ruling countries to ensure the security of their national defense in a fair and universal manner, and at the same time achieve substantial reductions in armaments by formulating concrete plans. Although it is not convenient to explain this new method in detail now, I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future of the preliminary consultations and will do my best to ensure their success. Even if this preliminary consultation fails to produce any practical results, the Japanese government will still spare no effort in disarmament and will do its best to achieve its goals at the formal naval disarmament conference.</p>
<p>If countries with large navies do their best to maintain their fair and just position and devote all their efforts to achieving the goal of disarmament, then any obstacles can be overcome. I believe that excellent results will be achieved. (United Press Telegram dated the 8th)</p>
<p>Mussolini's Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e17">French Newspapers Express Goodwill <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Not a Single Word About Treaty Revision</p>
<p>People in Hungary Deeply Surprised</p>
<p>Speech Delivered as King Departed for France</p>
<p>Southern Political Circles Consider Significance of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>(Paris) The French newspapers generally expressed goodwill towards Premier Mussolini's speech in Milan. Victory Daily News said that Mussolini's wording was two-sided, neither giving people cause for criticism nor closing the door to future consultations with France, Yugoslavia, the Little Entente, and even Germany. Morning Post referred to the Italian Premier's speech as</p>
<p>"a promising sign for European politics." Other newspapers expressed similar opinions. However, Mr. Pantignac's criticism in the Paris Echo was more explicit, stating that Premier Minister's remarks before Foreign Minister Bardoux's departure for Rome did not reveal the intentions of the Italian government. While Mussolini claimed to be concerned with maintaining peace,</p>
<p>he also used the failure of disarmament as an excuse to mobilize all Italian men aged eight to fifty-five. The European conference he mentioned clearly referred to the five great powers, and Germany could certainly not be excluded. If Mussolini further stated that injustice cannot achieve true peace, then we are repeating the revisionist path. Therefore, the Italian Premier's speech should not be immediately regarded as a sign of hope for the success of Bardoux's visit to Italy. (National Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungarian capital. Premier Mussolini's speech delivered yesterday afternoon in Milan greatly disappointed Hungary. When the official radio station broadcasted the speech and translated it from Italian into Hungarian, the listeners all found it strange that the Italian Premier did not mention Hungary at all, and felt uneasy. Because October 6th was a holiday, the newspapers were not published,</p>
<p>and public opinion's dissatisfaction with the Italian Premier's speech had not yet been expressed in the newspapers. However, in the evening, the government published the telegram exchanged between Premier Mussolini and Prime Minister Gömbös. Mussolini's telegram stated, "The final section of my speech, referring to peace and justice,</p>
<p>was said on behalf of Hungary." Gömbös replied, "Your telegram is respectfully noted and deeply appreciated." By the way, Gömbös had indicated a few days earlier that he planned to visit Warsaw on October 14th this year before proceeding to Rome. We should mention this here in passing. (Havas Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Premier Mussolini's speech in Milan the day before yesterday also did not mention the issue of revising treaties. According to the "Daily" here, this is not to be criticized,</p>
<p>but if the Hungarian demand for treaty revision is very strong, it would have been even better if the Italian Premier's speech had served as a warning.</p>
<p>(Havas Telegram dated the 8th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav capital. Premier Mussolini's speech delivered yesterday in Milan was listened to here with calm and attention. People in political circles all believed that the Prime Minister's speech,</p>
<p>delivered just as the King of Yugoslavia arrived in France, was of great significance. In his speech, when discussing the Austrian issue,</p>
<p>the Italian Premier stated that some people suspected that Italy intended to make Austria its protectorate, and that those who made this statement were either intentionally spreading rumors or making erroneous observations.</p>
<p>People in political circles here speculated that the Italian Premier's remarks</p>
<p>indicated whether Italy would no longer engage in anti-Yugoslav activities in Central Europe in the future. (Havas Telegram dated the 7th)</p>

<p>Austrian Issue Becomes a Dark Side Issue Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Rome. The Italian Daily, known as the mouthpiece of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the following comments on Premier Mussolini's expression of Germany in his Milan speech: "Apart from some unpleasant events and newspaper comments, Italy's attitude towards Germany has not changed substantially, and this attitude is clearly expressed in Premier Mussolini's speech, that is, the development of Europe without Germany's cooperation is almost hopeless. Italy's entire policy towards Germany is based on the principle of achieving a new reconciliation and justice with equal rights and existing treaties, and enabling Germany to return to the conference of great powers." The newspaper concluded by saying that Austria is currently becoming a dark side issue in German-Italian relations, but if Berlin's recent expression of goodwill in maintaining Austria's independence and internal peace</p>
<p>can be fully realized and other minor points can be satisfactorily eliminated, then this unexpected issue will soon disappear."</p>

<p>French Warship Enters Military Zone</p>
<h3 id="e23">Attacked by Turkish Coastal Battery <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Notification Delivery Delayed, Leading to Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Amicable Relations Between the Two Countries Will Not Be Affected</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey. A few days ago, two French destroyers, one named "Casabianca" and the other "Guepard," were fired upon by Turkish coastal batteries when entering the Bay of Smyrna. Afterwards, rumors spread that the French destroyers had canceled their original visit to Istanbul. Upon inquiring with the responsible parties, the details of the incident were learned as follows: The two French destroyers are currently cruising the waters of the Near East. Previously, the French government had requested the Turkish government's permission for the two warships to anchor in the ports of Istanbul and Smyrna. The Turkish government had granted permission to anchor in Istanbul, but the port of Smyrna was a military zone and forbidden to warships of all countries, so permission was not granted. The Turkish government's notification of refusal to anchor in the port of Smyrna arrived in Paris on October 1st. After receiving the notification forwarded from Paris on October 3rd, the French ambassador to Turkey attempted to forward it to the commanders of the two destroyers. Unfortunately, due to purely material circumstances, this notification was delayed until the day after the incident. Until October 4th, the Casabianca and Guepard had not yet received this ban and sailed into the port of Smyrna, resulting in them being fired upon by the Karaburun battery. The battery fired a total of three shots, indicating that the ships should not enter the port in violation of the prohibition. Afterwards, after the two ships exchanged signals with the battery, the two ships withdrew from the port of Smyrna. This incident did not involve any other complications and did not affect the plan for the two destroyers to cruise the waters of the Near East. The two destroyers will still anchor in the port of Istanbul as originally planned, and the Turkish authorities in Istanbul have prepared to provide them with a sincere welcome. This matter will also have no impact on the relations between France and Turkey. The friendly relations between France and Turkey have always been cordial, and the unanimous actions of the representatives of the two countries at the recent League of Nations meeting in Geneva are sufficient to show the close friendship between the two countries, which will not be damaged by this minor incident.</p>

<p>Important Leaders Either Flee or Are Arrested</p>
<p>Revolutionary Ideas in the Country Still High</p>
<p>Madrid. The declaration of the Catalan Republic lasted only a few hours before it failed. Therefore, the unrest in Spain can now be regarded as over. The government is now trying to restore the country to its normal life tomorrow. There is only sporadic fighting in Barcelona, where the militia and the army are still surrounding the rebels and collecting the weapons and ammunition abandoned by the defeated. In addition, all riots throughout the country have been suppressed. At the same time, troops in various places are still on alert to prevent the recurrence of riots, and residents are asked not to go out at night. Those who must go out should raise both hands while walking on the road to show that they have no other intentions.</p>
<p>It is reported that former Socialist Prime Minister Azaña, who was elected as the president of the Catalan Republic, was arrested near Barcelona today while trying to board a ship to escape to France.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Barcelona, several important leaders of the rebels have fled to avoid arrest. Azaña's whereabouts are unknown. It is said that he has been arrested, or that the militia is now actively searching for him. In addition, several leaders, such as Interior Minister Deng Kaitu, escaped through an underground passage in the government office, with several machine guns covering the exit of the passage. (Reuters Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid. Political circles believe that the revolution and general strike will soon be suppressed. The government also believes that after the central army responded quickly to the incident and a large number of rebels were arrested, the main force of the revolution has been broken. However, revolutionary ideas are still high, especially in the northern provinces. Even in the capital, security has not been fully restored. Fierce fighting broke out again at the East Station last night. Regular troops and the National Guard were heavily attacked by armed rebels for a night until this morning. Premier Lerroux's private residence was also shot at by rebels entrenched in neighboring houses. The province of Asturias is the center of the revolutionary movement. Thousands of rebels are said to have attacked the central army, which, due to its small numbers, blew up the bridges to stop the rebels from advancing. (National Telegram dated the 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid. At a special cabinet meeting this afternoon, it was decided to send six additional infantry regiments to the northern provinces. The situation in the province of Asturias is still worrying. According to the latest information, several northern provinces are still occupied by the rebels. It is reported that Premier Lerroux will ask the parliament, which will meet next Tuesday, to restore the emergency decree abolishing the death penalty under the republican system. Due to unrest in various places, the government has issued an order to seal off border traffic. Foreign travelers, even those with passports, cannot pass through and must have a special permit to be released. However, the government's broadcast tonight was very optimistic. The municipal government of the capital, which was composed of Marxists,</p>
<p>was dissolved by the government today and replaced by ten reliable citizens. Plainclothes officers are firing guns from the rooftops from time to time, especially in the workers' districts. Traffic in several places has been restored to its original state under the protection of the police and the army. This evening, the civil administrator of Madrid called on government officials and workers to resume work tomorrow,</p>
<p>or they would be dismissed. (National Telegram dated the 8th)</p>

<p>The Government's Position is Becoming More Stable</p>
<p>Local Autonomy Ultimately Fails</p>
<p>Madrid. The national army is loyal to the government. According to news from Paris, a regiment of Spanish soldiers stationed in Girona, northern Catalonia, has rebelled, killing one general, two majors, and two captains. However, this claim has not been verified. (Reuters Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>Madrid. In order to avoid the spread of rumors, the government has instructed the Ministry of Interior to report the situation every hour by radio, which will be relayed to various places by radio stations in Seville, Valencia, and Barcelona. Interior Minister Valero denied the rumors that two army regiments in the Lerida region had joined the rebels in a radio broadcast. (Havas Telegram dated the 7th)</p>
<p>Premier Lerroux announced in the corridors of the Ministry of Interior that the unrest in Catalonia and Asturias was completely under the control of the government army and thanked the people for their compliance. However, a few minutes later, the sound of artillery resumed, and the public fled in panic. Fighting broke out in five more places in the capital. The rebels arrived at the central station by train and killed three people with rifle fire in the central market. After the army and the militia received reinforcements, they restored order. There were public demonstrations in the streets, cheering to celebrate the unity of Spain. (</p>

<p>Madrid. The failure of the uprising in the autonomous province of Catalonia, with Chairman Companys and others surrendering one after another, has dealt a fatal blow to the revolutionary movement in Spain. The leaders of the general strike movement throughout the country must also be demoralized. At present, traffic is obstructed in various places, and it is not easy to transmit information, but the power of the central government should soon restore the situation to normal. In short, the government's position is now becoming more stable, and the Popular Action Party, which participated in the Lerroux cabinet, (that is, the Catholic Party led by Robles) will undoubtedly take the opportunity to develop. The current Spanish government and the majority party in parliament do not approve of the system of local autonomy. The political future will tend towards authoritarianism. Therefore, the failure of Catalonia this time has a great impact on the province's own position and the general politics of the country. This is what we can predict.

<p>Central Government Appoints New Chairman</p>
<p>The situation in Madrid and Barcelona seems to have improved. The government has appointed Aleyna as the chairman of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia. The whole province is returning to normal, with only a few places experiencing shootings. (Havas News Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>Government troops bombarded the Catalan government building, leaving bullet holes all over the walls, and the central balcony was also blown away, demonstrating the fierceness of the attack by the troops under General Batet. Catalan government Chairman Companys requested 3,000 soldiers stationed in Sabadell for assistance, but they were slow to arrive. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, he requested surrender. When Mr. Companys emerged from the devastated government building with his head held high, soldiers were lined up on both sides. Previous reports of his injury were inaccurate. It is now believed that Mr. Companys and other arrested leaders are being held in a ship in the port of Barcelona.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Barcelona, it is now very dangerous to walk in the city because rebels are still hiding and engaging in sniping. Residents are lying on the ground floor all night to prevent stray bullets from hitting people from above. General Batet broadcast an order on the radio today, ordering residents to open all windows, otherwise they will be shot at. This is to prevent rebels from hiding by the windows and sniping. Rumors say that the government's bombing of the Catalan government building resulted in between five hundred and one thousand deaths, but the actual number of casualties cannot be determined at this time. (Reuters News Agency, August 7th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: After fierce fighting between the central government troops and the provincial troops, the provincial troops were defeated and have now surrendered. As of now, 34 people have died and many have been injured in the incident. 32 people are seriously injured. General Batet, the commander-in-chief of the central troops, has issued an order, ordering all workers and civil servants in the province to return to work tomorrow morning, and those who violate the order will be severely punished. Important officials of the autonomous province who have been arrested include Chairman Companys, Education Director Gasol, Finance Director Esteve, Provincial Assembly Speaker Mestre, and Guard Captain Farras. They are now all detained on the "Uruguay" ship. Gao Er, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Lieutenant Colonel Ricardo, the police captain, are both missing. Former central government Prime Minister and left-wing leader Azaña is also missing. Mr. Azaña was not in the provincial government or the old governor's office last night. It is reported that before the central government announced martial law nationwide, Mr. Azaña had a long conversation with Chairman Companys of the autonomous government, expressed his disapproval of the incident, and predicted that the outcome would be a failure. Mr. Azaña then quietly withdrew because no one listened to him and sought a place to hide. The city has not yet returned to peace. A large store caught fire, and it is generally believed that anarchists took advantage of the chaos to commit arson and sabotage. Casualties in the turmoil:</p>

<p>Regarding the failure in Catalonia, there is one small thing to record. Previously, when the radio station finished broadcasting, it always played the Spanish national anthem and the Catalan autonomous province anthem. Last night, after the incident occurred, each radio station only played the provincial anthem, but today only the national anthem is played. (Havas News Agency, August 7th)</p>

Today, the police suddenly ambushed and arrested many people, including a Socialist Party member. The fighting in Vila Puebla today was quite fierce because the rebels there planned to establish a Soviet system. Six people were killed and 25 injured in the battle. The rebels burned down classrooms and the Farmers' Party office. The village of Carolina in Andalusia Province was occupied by rioters, and the home of the Radical Party leader was burned down. Four members of the militia training team were injured. The police heard the alarm and called for help, throwing grenades to drive out the rioters.

<p>Settlers Petition Okada to Reconsider</p>
<p>Military Headquarter Is Hardline, Prime Minister Finds It Difficult To Please Both Sides</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The top leaders of the Colonial Affairs Ministry held a meeting at 6:00 PM yesterday. Mori Shige, the clerical official who returned to Tokyo on the 6th, and Hatta, the section chief who returned on the 7th, reported that local police officials were fiercely opposed to the commander of the Kwantung Army Military Police concurrently serving as the police chief of the Kwantung Government, and the situation was serious. The meeting did not end until 12:10 AM today. As a result, it was decided to hold another plenary meeting today, and it was also decided to have Vice Minister Tsubouchi visit Okada, who concurrently serves as the Minister of Colonial Affairs, and Land Minister Hayashi to request a modification of the reform plan. Vice Minister Tsubouchi then visited Okada Colonial Minister at 9:00 AM this morning, and Bureau Director Ikomo and clerical official Mori Shige at 10:00 AM, to submit petitions and reports. (Hualian News Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of reforming the agencies in Manchuria, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs listened to the results of the inspection of the actual situation in the Kwantung Government. As a result, the Vice Ministers Tsubouchi and Tanaka, along with section chiefs and lower officials of each bureau, discussed and decided to submit a written opinion to Okada, who concurrently serves as the Minister of Colonial Affairs. A letter of application signed by all high-ranking officials was delivered to Okada Colonial Minister on the 7th, as follows:</p>
<p>The local police officials' opinion on the reform issue is that they absolutely oppose the government's system of having the commander of the military police concurrently serve as the police chief, and the reform plan for the deployment. If the government forcibly implements it, it is unknown what will happen in the future, and even a bloody tragedy may occur. It is hoped that the government will take this into account, understand the actual situation on the ground, change its understanding, and reconsider the reform plan. (Dentsu News Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The police officials of the Kwantung Government are vehemently opposed to the military police system. Although the attitude of the Ministry of the Army is also very tough, it is unwilling to show weakness in this regard and is still seeking to implement its claims. However, the reform plan for anti-counterfeiting is a decision of the Cabinet, and if it is modified, it will lead to political responsibility. Prime Minister Okada is in a difficult position to satisfy both sides, and it is attracting much attention from political parties as to how he will act. (Hualian News Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) At the end of last week, Japanese police officers from 25 locations in Manchuria held a secret meeting in Lushun, deciding to form a united front to oppose Tokyo's plan to merge the police department into the Military Police Headquarters.

The Japanese police in Manchuria are currently working as usual, but they are determined to implement their protest, at any cost. (Reuters News Agency, August 8th)</p>

<p>Covering Up Aggression with Talk of Peace</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Nagai, recently gave a speech to representatives of the Berlin evening newspapers, explaining the situation in the Far East and the relationship between Japan and the League of Nations in Europe. He said, "Asia for Asians" is a slogan that is often misunderstood by the world. Asians do not want to completely break away from the "shackles" of Europe, but want to maintain and develop Asia's inherent culture so that all nations in the East and West can contribute greatly to world peace. Regarding the League of Nations, Japan has always been prepared to cooperate with Geneva in cultural undertakings, but in the political sphere, Japan refuses to cooperate with the League of Nations. Japan has nothing to do with the Gran Chaco incident, and whether it exports arms to Bolivia or Paraguay is irrelevant to Japan. This is why Japan ignores the League of Nations' resolution to ban the export of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay. When asked whether Japan supports using meetings or direct negotiations with foreign governments, he cannot generalize, but must consider the specific circumstances of each issue. In short, Japan is always prepared to cooperate in anything that is conducive to peace and culture, regardless of the means chosen. Finally, he said that the relationship between Japan and Germany is based on mutual respect. (Havas News Agency, August 8th)</p>

<p>(London) Britain has never produced soybeans, and all domestic needs have been met by Manchuria. Now, soybeans are being planted on the farm of the American automobile tycoon Ford Company near Chelmsford, and there has been an excellent harvest. This is unprecedented in Britain. According to the Daily Express, the soybean harvest has already been completed on the farm's ten hectares. This experiment is very interesting and will be further developed in the future, and the scale will be expanded. The soil and climate of Britain are both suitable. The Ministry of Agriculture has received letters from the majority of farmers, believing that soybean imports amount to hundreds of thousands of tons each year. Now that they can be grown domestically, they should request the government to vigorously promote this crop. According to soybean experts, the beans planted by the Ford Company farm are of better quality than those produced in Manchuria. (Havas News Agency, August 8th)</p>

<p>Cairo: Two doctors have entered the palace, and official circles are silent about the Egyptian King's daily life, so rumors are rampant.

He is recognized by the public as being able to endure hardship. He is good at French and English, and usually speaks Turkish, although the 14 million people under his rule all speak Arabic. King Fuad does not have a deep understanding of Arabic writing. The King's great-grandfather was Muhammad Ali, an Albanian who was known for defeating the British army. If it were not for the intervention of the European powers at the time, Muhammad Ali would have overthrown the Ottoman Empire long ago. Fuad has been in power for more than fourteen years.

<p>Ma Chaojun... Chinese Rural Economy</p>
<p>Sun Ke... Discussion of Draft Constitution</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the 151st Memorial Week held by the Central Government at 9:00 AM on the 8th, Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ma Chaojun, Li Ciwen, Chen Ce, and all staff members, totaling approximately 500 people, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang presided. Ma Chaojun reported on "The Reasons for the Collapse of the Chinese Rural Economy and the Principles of Relief," stating that the reason for the collapse of the Chinese rural economy is that the relationship between the supply and demand of agricultural labor in various provinces is not adapted. Many places lack agricultural labor, while many places have a surplus of agricultural labor. This type of maladaptation may be due to population, natural disasters, military service, low grain prices, or the loss of the Northeast on September 18th. However, the root cause of the rural collapse is not here, but because (1) there are too many farmers, (2) there is too little arable land, (3) the agricultural labor productivity is too small, (4) the productivity is too weak, and (5) the transportation costs are too expensive. The fundamental principle of relief is to develop agriculture and industries other than agriculture at the same time. The two must not be neglected in order to eliminate all the causes of the rural collapse. As for the capital for developing industries, the country must first be stabilized so that foreigners will be willing to invest, and then all industries can be built. The meeting adjourned after the speech. (Central News Agency, August 8th)</p>

The remaining chapters will continue to be discussed, and the discussion will be completed in about a week.

They were then pursued southward via Shatan by two battalions of troops. On the 27th, they were engaged near Taoshu Shop, resulting in four hours of intense fighting, after which they were routed and fled. The pursuing battalions continued their pursuit along different routes, causing the bandits to become even more disorganized, fleeing into the deep mountains and forests. The search and suppression are still underway. It is estimated that over a hundred bandits were killed on the spot and along the route. That evening, another two hours of intense fighting took place at Sucun Slope, resulting in the death of over thirty bandits, the seizure of eleven rifles, several mules and horses, and the capture of six male and female bandits, etc. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>

The pseudo-3rd Division has three infantry regiments, one special service, one guard, one communications, and one engineering company each. Each company has approximately fifty rifles, with each rifle carrying ten rows of ammunition. (2) Soldiers are given a daily allowance of 14 cents. Rice is forcibly requisitioned from residents, and salt is looted from Zhanghuban. They are only barely fed three meals a day, causing great suffering. They are only held in check by heavy constraints, making it impossible to escape. (3) In the Battle of Kuzhu, the 3rd Battalion of the pseudo-7th Army Corps suffered heavy casualties, with only one company remaining. The pseudo-Military Commission strictly ordered them to defend the fortifications west of Wenfang to the death, with Luo Binghui personally supervising the battle.

<p>(Nanchang) When our army killed Zhang Sheng, the battalion commander of the pseudo-3rd Division, they found a pseudo-instruction from bandit leader Peng Dehuai. It described the impact of pseudo-officers and soldiers surrendering and providing information, and the lack of fighting spirit due to the disintegration of the bandit army. This proves that their total collapse is not far off. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Zhou Hunyuan to the Executive Headquarters, many bandit soldiers are currently unwilling to fight, but they are being monitored by ten-man squads everywhere, making it impossible to surrender. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Wuhu)徽 Bandit Luo Binghui was severely attacked by the 7th Army, with two pseudo-division commanders killed and even more captured. He has fled into the mountains on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Key points such as Hetian Guanqian Nanshan Ba have been recovered. The pseudo-9th Army Corps and 24th Division initially resisted stubbornly based on the terrain, but were ultimately defeated. The National Army is now advancing towards Tingzhou to attack. As the various bandit areas are being successively recovered, the Provincial Government has specifically formulated ten measures to urge wealthy people to return to their hometowns, requiring wealthy people who have left their hometowns to move back within three months. If they are unable to move back due to circumstances, they must appoint a representative to manage their property and business, and report to the district public office, which will then forward the information to the county for record-keeping. Otherwise, the county government may, at the request of the district chief, seal and manage their property or business. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhou Hunyuan telegraphed on the 30th, stating that his troops attacked the bandit's strong fortifications on the high ground around Gaoxingxu Shixingshan and its vicinity on the morning of the 30th. The bandits stubbornly resisted from the fortifications. After our officers and soldiers bravely and fiercely attacked, a fierce battle ensued, and the bandits were finally defeated. More than 30 bandit fortifications were occupied one after another. The bandits could not withstand the attack and fled to the area south of Gaoxingxu. After our troops fiercely pursued, they were in a miserable state, suffering extremely heavy casualties. By noon, all the attacked areas were completely occupied. In this battle, a total of over 1,000 bandits were killed, and over 400 people, including the regimental political commissar, were captured, along with four light and heavy machine guns and over 400 rifles. The bandits engaged in this battle were identified as the 12th and 2nd divisions, the strongest combat forces of the bandits, and they were not even worth a single blow. This shows that the bandit army is in disarray and its total collapse is not far off. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The military operations to suppress bandits in Fujian are progressing smoothly. According to combined military intelligence, the bandits have built several lines of defense in Pengkou Liancheng Xidi. The first line, along Chengxi Datoukeng Jingbaishi Naolong Naoling, serves as their forward defense line. The second line, along Taipingling Zhishuling Qiaoxia Dong Jinhuashan Zhu Zailing Baiyi Yangling Baxian , stretches for fifty miles and is their main fortified defense line. Furthermore, west of Zhongwu Village, across the north and south high mountains of Hengyi , stretches dozens of miles, forming their third line of defense. Nanshan Ba Daluowu's north and south high grounds form their fourth line of defense. Our Second Route Army began its attack on the 26th of last month, occupying the bandit's forward defense line on the same day. On the 27th, they continued to attack the bandit's main defense line, first capturing Baiyi Yangling, then capturing Qili Hengpai Shanggulouling, attacking the left flank of the bandits. More than 700 bandit corpses were found in their trenches. On the 28th, they continued to attack Songmaoling, Zhu Zailing, Jinlongshan Qiaoxia and other places, all of which were successively recovered. On the 29th, the battlefields were cleared, and fortifications and pillboxes were constructed at the same time. On the 30th, the bandits in the Huangyi Nan area were attacked, and the newly recovered areas were occupied on the 1st and 2nd to construct fortifications. On the 3rd, a fierce attack was launched on the bandit's fourth line of defense at Nanshan Ba, which was finally recovered by noon on the 4th. The remaining bandits fled backwards, and our army has occupied the key points of various villages east of Changting. They are now advancing to Hetian, and the recovery of Changting is no longer a problem. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Luo's bandits, holed up in Changting, have four lines of defense, with Zhongxing Village as the first line, Nanshan Ba as the second line, Hetian as the third line, and the Widow's Bridge area outside Changting City as the fourth line. The Eastern Route Army occupied Zhongwu Village on the 29th and attacked Nanshan Ba on the 4th, which can be captured soon. Although the third line of Shatian has no high mountains, and there is the danger of the Tingjiang River, it is not difficult to attack and directly strike Changting. It is only a matter of time. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After Zhou Hunyuan defeated the pseudo-12th and 2nd divisions in Xingguo Shixing, the bandits who retreated south from Gaoxingxu were almost all bombed to death by aircraft. Many bandit soldiers are unwilling to fight because they are being monitored by ten-man squads, making it impossible to surrender. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Eastern Route telegram on the 4th stated that Nanshan and surrounding highlands were captured on the 4th. The pseudo-9th Army and 24th Division retreated, and Hetian is within sight and can be captured immediately. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Disaster Relief Measures for Various Provinces <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The water and drought disasters in various provinces in the north and south this year are severe. The government has ordered them to report separately so that land taxes can be reduced or exempted. The Relief Commission, together with the Ministries of Interior and Finance, has discussed and drafted measures. According to a responsible official of the Ministry of Finance, the Relief Commission of the Ministry of Interior has investigated and found that the drought damage in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is over 50%. The flood damage in provinces such as Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong is less than 50%. Because the Relief Commission has received many requests for relief from various parties, it has consulted with the Ministry several times. However, the disaster situation is too severe, and relief measures have not yet been agreed upon. As for disaster relief measures, in 1930, the National Government ordered the central government to allocate 1% of its annual income and the provincial and county governments to allocate 2% annually as disaster relief funds. It was also stipulated that disasters with damage below 50% would be relieved with local funds, and disasters with damage above 50% would be relieved with funds allocated by the central government if local funds were insufficient. The Ministry, based on these regulations, has ordered the affected provinces to first raise funds locally for relief. If that is insufficient, the central government will raise funds or purchase seeds. As for the reduction or exemption of land taxes, the reports from various provinces are complete, and orders for implementation will be issued separately after review. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e92">Unease on the Border of the Puppet State (Harbin Correspondence) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Manzhouli is Calm on the Surface</p>
<p>Dakerh is Heavily Fortified</p>
<p>The news heard in Harbin is inevitably one-sided, but the tension of the Japanese army can be seen from their actions. There is no doubt that they are preparing to deal with any unexpected events at any time. However, there is a strange thing here, that is, Manzhouli, the northwest border pass of the three eastern provinces, is very calm on the Japanese side. There are very few troops stationed there, as if they have not actively set up defenses. Judging from this point, there is no intention of war on the surface, and the Japanese there have expressed their safety, engaging in the development of the forests and minerals buried in the nearby mountains and rivers, as well as aquatic resources, implicitly showing that they want to</p>
<p>compete with the Soviet Union in developing Siberia.</p>
<p>At first, we felt this was very strange. Why did the Soviet Union gather the Transbaikal Military District, stationing more than nine infantry regiments, seven cavalry regiments, distributing 120 artillery pieces, more than 60 aircraft, three tank squadrons, three armored trains, fifteen armored vehicles, and one chemical warfare battalion, as well as several G.P.U. (Political Security Team) units in areas such as Da Uli and Aba Heights? Behind these troops are two major air force bases, Irkutsk and Nizhneudinsk. Tomsk, Omsk, Novosibirsk, and other places are all heavily garrisoned, serving as a reserve team for the Far East. If something happens, they can be concentrated in Chita in an instant. We tried to climb the small mountains near Manzhouli to see, and we could see neatly arranged barracks on the opposite Russian territory, with steel-reinforced concrete fortresses everywhere.</p>
<p>The impetuous and war-loving Japanese, witnessing this situation and hearing that the Siberian Railway is laying double tracks and working day and night, how can they be so calm to deal with it, or be dedicated to the basic work of the economy? After repeated investigations by reporters, they learned that the Japanese army believes that Manzhouli is backed by Hulun Lake, and the Ergun River is a position with its back to the water. If they want to defend this place or use it as a base for attack, it is strategically disadvantageous. Therefore, they do not set up defenses in Manzhouli or Hailar, acting out a peaceful appearance and creating a military intention. They have built all the military fortresses in the Greater Khingan Mountains. These mountain borders and forest edges not only have solid fortresses and hidden trenches, but also have anti-aircraft gun positions.</p>
<p>The most important work is that the Hailar River, Gen River, and Derbul River all widely cultivate White Russian people. They have a deep hatred for the Soviet Union and almost cannot coexist with the Red Party.</p>
<p>The Japanese comforted them in every way, wanting them to be used by Japan in the future. Now they are being driven by the Japanese side. These people who have fled to foreign countries also want to turn over, so they are willing to listen.</p>
<p>In fact, the military focus, whether on the Soviet or Japanese side, once war is used, the center of the war, land battle, is not in Manzhouli in the west, nor in Suifenhe in the east, but in Daheihe on the Heilongjiang bank near Heilongjiang Province. About eighty miles downstream of Heihe is the famous Aihui City. Across a river about one mile wide is the Soviet territory of Hailanpao. If Japan adopts an offensive, it will inevitably use the Tao'ang Road, Huhai Road, and the under-construction Erzhan-Heihe Railway, cross the river to the east, break through the Hailanpao defense line, and cut off the connection between the Ussuri Railway and the Siberian Railway, so that the coastal province and the Transbaikal region cannot echo each other. The commander of the Far East Army in Boli cannot command the entire army, and the Japanese army can attack Vladivostok by sea and land, seizing the East and West Siberian regions as appropriate. The Soviet Union is probably also focusing on Hailanpao, quickly crossing the Heilongjiang River, breaking through Heihe, crossing the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and going south to Keshan to spy on Harbin, and attacking Longjiang to the west to attack Taonan. This is a place they must fight for. Therefore, Japan is heavily garrisoned in Heihe and Aihui, and builds a transportation network. The defenses of the Lesser Khingan Mountains</p>
<p>Although not very thorough, it is also paying attention to planning strict precautions, fearing that Heihe will be lost and the entire line of the three eastern provinces will be shaken.</p>
<p>The triangular area where the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River meet has many disputes and is more likely to cause problems. At the Sanhekou, both sides have wire fences, and there is also police on land. The Japanese also use the name of the puppet on the water, equipped with two large 900-ton gunboats, four gunboats carrying eight guns, eight small 100-ton gunboats, and two small aircraft carriers carrying aircraft, carrying 80 seaplanes, specializing in monitoring Soviet smuggling and striving for military advantages. However, the Soviet side is also heavily guarded and will not easily let the Japanese army fly over. The two sides confront each other, and everyone wants to grasp the military advantage and establish a solid military base is obvious. (October 1)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Three Route Army Recaptures Shicheng <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>丨Changting and Xingguo Will Also Be Taken Soon丨</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The headquarters has just received a phone call from the Three Route Army from the front line stating that Shicheng County was completely recaptured at approximately 5:00 AM on the 6th.</p>
<p>The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Previously, the Red Bandits used Shicheng to connect Jiangxi and Fujian, with Guangchang to the north, Ruijin to the south, Changting and Ninghua to the east,</p>
<p>and Ningdu to the west, serving as a connected area for the bandit areas in eastern Jiangxi, southern Jiangxi, western Fujian, and northern Jiangxi after the loss of Guangchang. Zhu De and Mao Zedong specially deployed the pseudo-Third Army Corps as the main force in the mountainous area along the border between Guangchang and Shicheng, Zhihua front, building a network of fortifications extending twenty miles in length and width.</p>
<p>Blockhouses and trenches were intertwined, and the defense was extremely tight. The Three Route Army successively fought multiple bloody battles with the pseudo-4th, 5th, 15th, and other divisions. The fortifications near Zhihua front were violently bombed by the Nationalist army's artillery and aircraft, and were completely destroyed. Starting on the 26th of last month, our various divisions launched an attack on the bandit positions in Zhonghua Mountain, Zhongzi Village, and other areas north of Shicheng, capturing two or thirty bandit blockhouses in succession. On the 30th, they arrived at Xiaosongshi. Peng Dehuai's forces were repeatedly defeated under the control of the Nationalist army's infantry, artillery, and air force, and their spirit was completely lost. The Nationalist army took advantage of the victory to advance and directly attacked Shicheng County. At that time, the pseudo-13th Army Corps and the pseudo-25th Division, which were defending the city, still attempted to fight with their backs to the city. On the 5th of this month, the Nationalist army launched an attack on the city, and completely occupied the county seat at dawn on the 6th. The remnants of the bandits retreated from the Xincun area west of Shicheng to the border of Ningdu. It has been seven years since Shicheng fell into the hands of bandits in 1928, and it has finally seen the light of day. The newly appointed Shicheng County magistrate, someone, had previously been stationed in Yiqian to work, and has now entered the city with the army to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Xingguo, Changting, and Gulonggang in Xingguo were recaptured in the same period as Shicheng. The East Route Army has advanced to a certain place west of Hetian, and Tingcheng is in sight. Recapturing should occur within a few days.</p>
<p>The main force of the pseudo-22nd, 3rd, and other divisions of Xingguo has long been defeated by the Nationalist army. Approaching the county seat, capturing it is only a matter of time. Gulonggang is a key area for entering Ningdu City. The Nationalist army has completely conquered the bandit positions and fortifications west of Gulonggang, and the Yonglong Road is also largely completed. (October 6)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Summoned Zhang Xueliang and He Chengjun</p>
<h3 id="e94">To Discuss the Aftermath of the Bandit Areas in Detail <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The generals were given strategies and returned to their defenses immediately.</p>
<p>It is expected that the remnants of the bandits in the border areas will be completely eliminated within three months.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters decided to attend and instruct the expanded memorial week.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou from Xunyang a few days ago, he immediately convened a meeting of generals in Hankou to instruct on the details of clearing the remnant bandits in the border areas, and the general arrangements have been made. On the morning of the 7th, Chiang Kai-shek read important documents at the headquarters and individually summoned the generals of the various armies, Xu Yuanquan, Shangguan Yunxiang, Liu Maoen, Hao Mengling, Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, Liang Guanying, etc., and once again gave them strategies, ordering them to eliminate the remnant bandits in the shortest possible time. He also ordered that the construction of highways and blockhouses in the defense areas of the various armies should be completed quickly in accordance with the prescribed period, so that local security could be permanently consolidated. That noon,</p>
<p>He also summoned Zhang Xueliang and He Chengjun to discuss the implementation steps of the aftermath in detail, which lasted a long time. At 1:00 PM, Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, departed from the headquarters, went to the Jianghan Customs, patrolled the Jianghan Road, crossed the Xunlimen Railway to the Zhongzheng Road area, and then turned to Zhongshan Road through Qiaokou, passed the French Concession, and returned to the headquarters. At that time, the British Consul General in Hankou, Hilder, and the German Consul General, Timm, had a long friendship with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and were going to the headquarters to pay their respects. Chiang Kai-shek immediately prepared dishes and refreshments to entertain them, and summoned the mayor of Hankou, Wu Guozhen, to host them.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM, Hilder and Timm departed. Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, went to Zhongshan Park for sightseeing, lingering among the forests, springs, pavilions, and terraces. When they had had their fill of pleasure, they returned to the headquarters, which was already illuminated by thousands of lights. The Wuhan General Headquarters decided to hold an expanded memorial week for Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the 8th, and earnestly requested Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to attend and instruct. It has been approved. The General Affairs Department of the General Headquarters specially notified the party, government, military, and academic institutions in Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou on the 7th, saying, "It has been found that next Monday, that is, at 9:00 AM on the 8th, this headquarters will hold an expanded memorial week. It has been ordered that all party, government, military, police, and academic institutions in Wuchang, Hanyang, and Hankou should come to participate, and so on. In addition to sending separate letters, this letter is hereby sent for reference. Please check the separately opened regulations for each level and arrive at the headquarters auditorium on time to participate. The participating institutions are as follows: members of the provincial party headquarters and above, members of the municipal party headquarters and above, officials with senior appointments and above in the Hubei Provincial Government, branch chiefs of the Hubei Provincial Public Security Bureau and above, branch chiefs of the Hankou Municipal Public Security Bureau and above, directors of all public security bureaus in Hubei Province, director of the Xiang'e-Ping-Han Railway Bureau, and members of the special party headquarters of the two railway bureaus, directors and deputy directors of the Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office, and head of the patrol regiment, colonels and above in the Pacification Headquarters, colonels and above in the Wuhan Garrison Command, principals of middle schools and above in Wuyang and Xia, please have the Hubei Provincial Government notify the captain and deputy captain of the Fourth Air Force Team, the stationmaster of the Hankou Air Station, captains and above of the naval fleet office, and directors of the offices of the military division stationed in Hankou and above, please have the Pacification Headquarters notify the director of the Third Recruitment Office, the director of the Hanyang Arsenal, and officers of this headquarters with the rank of major and above." The senior generals will also return to their defenses separately after participating in the memorial week. Because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has to rush to Luoyang before the Double Ten Festival to attend the opening ceremony of the Central Military Academy branch school, he cannot stay in Hankou for long. He has decided to take a special train on the Pinghan Railway to Zhengzhou and transfer to Luoyang on the evening of the 8th. Zhang Xueliang will accompany him. He will still return to Hankou in about a few days. The plan for clearing the remnant bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang have agreed upon this time is extremely detailed. If it is earnestly implemented, it is expected that the effect of clearing the area can be achieved within three months. (7th)</p>

<p>Zhang Danhua Did Indeed Commit Suicide Due to Illness</p>
<p>Zhang Danhua, a resident of West Street, died from a gunshot wound due to illness. Various newspapers have reported this. At the time, the local news spread that Zhang had committed suicide. Relatives and friends in the city believed that Zhang was usually open-minded and would never commit suicide, and they did not believe it. Yesterday (the 6th), his sister went to the countryside and obtained two suicide notes, both addressed to his sister, instructing her to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>The reason for the suicide was that the long-term illness was difficult to cure and unbearable pain. He also asked the Jingshen Society Daoyuan to conduct a requiem for the deceased and not report it to the authorities for an autopsy. Both were addressed to his relative Xue Qiao, entrusting him to manage all rent matters and requesting him to continue to collect them on his behalf. Moreover, the state of death was extremely tragic. He used a self-defense pistol to hold the gun with his right hand and aimed it at his temple. The bullet entered from the right temple and exited from behind his left ear. The entrance wound was very small, and the exit wound was about half an inch. His hands were crossed, the pistol fell on his right arm, and the pillow and bedding were stained with blood. He was coffined by his sister and transported out on the 7th,</p>
<p>And placed in the funeral home outside the south gate. Those who knew Zhang in the past all sighed that Zhang's ending was so unexpected.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Robberies by Land and Water Occur Continuously <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, bandits have been uneasy and rampant. Four cases have occurred in just two days. (1) There were two sailing boats each between Wuxi and Panjiaqiao and Zhouqiao, which belong to Wujin County.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, the two sailing boats simultaneously departed from Wu and headed to Wuxi. At about 2:00 AM that night, when they sailed to the Maopeng Lane area near Zhangshe in Wuxi, they suddenly encountered a bandit boat, and more than a dozen bandits rushed out, holding two pistols.</p>
<p>They robbed the boats, losing seven or eighty yuan. (2) The sailing boats in Dangkou Town, District 8, travel between Suzhou and Dangkou without interruption. The night before last, they opened to Suzhou as usual. When they traveled to Feijiawei, they also encountered two bandit boats, and more than a dozen bandits robbed the native boats, losing more than one hundred yuan. (3) At 12:00 AM on the 6th, eight or nine bandits suddenly came to the house of the late resident Xia Jinwan in Laoxizhuang, North Extension City, District 8. They wrapped their heads in blue cloth, spoke in a strong northern accent, and broke open the gate to enter, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, and arbitrarily searching. They robbed about seven or eight hundred yuan in cash, foreign currency, and jewelry. (4) About three miles away from Laoxizhuang, the Yuantong Nunnery was also robbed by five or six bandits, losing seventy or eighty yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Disputes Arise Again in the Automobile Industry <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The local business automobiles had previously had disputes with the Xicheng Long-Distance Automobile Company's illegal collection of tolls, resulting in repeated disputes, unanimous strikes, and filing petitions with the provincial and county authorities. Later, Shen Qi, the director of the Provincial Highway Administration, personally came to Wuxi to handle the matter, and an compromise solution was agreed upon, and the disputes were resolved. However, since the resumption of business automobiles, the long-distance company still does not calculate the collection of tolls according to kilometers, but according to station names. For example, five jiao is charged to Tangtou Station, and five jiao is also charged to stations such as Xizhang Wangzhuang and Hujia Ferry, which has once again aroused the opposition of the automobiles. They convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures, advocating that the toll be calculated at 1.5 fen per kilometer, and decided to appeal to the authorities for relief again, and vowed not to stop until the goal is achieved.</p>

<p>Zhang Hanlin, the former president of the local Farmers Bank, was thoroughly investigated by Luo Meizhong and others who were sent by the provincial government and the Agricultural Bank headquarters to Danyang, and it was learned that Zhang had committed private malpractice before taking office. Chairman Chen of the provincial government telegraphed Chairman Liu of Anhui Province to detain him, welcome him to the province, and bring him back to the county for investigation in accordance with the law. Now, County Magistrate Bi has notified the local cooperative societies to report whether there are any funds involved and corruption. There are several companies such as Miaoduan Credit Cooperative that have submitted reports to the authorities. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Xu Cheng, the trial judge, held a hearing and questioned them. As a result, he instructed each to provide witnesses and to bring the accounts to the court for review. Zhang Hanlin was sent into custody, and another hearing was scheduled.</p>

They robbed more than 300 silver yuan. The local water police learned of this and went to arrest them, but the bandits had already fled without a trace.</p>

<p>Appealed to the City Party Headquarters Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, another group of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship Asama Maru on the 3rd of this month. The total is Wu Wentian, Xu Baonian, Xu Zijin, Sun Dianzhong, Ma Zuofa, Ji Yulai, Xia Zhongxing, Chen Anhai, Zhou Chengzhai, etc. Three people from Taizhou have already returned to their hometown. Among the above-mentioned people, there are five from Huzhou and four from Qingtian. They are now staying at the Daxin Inn in this city. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency went to inquire about the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Expelled from Japan and Returned to China <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Those who were forced to return to China after being expelled from Japan this time</p>
<p>are mostly workers, with sugar and coal workers being the majority. Most of them were engaged in small businesses in Tokyo, Nagoya, and other places, with a population of over a thousand households. They were usually envied by the Japanese, who often extorted money from them or searched their homes in the middle of the night. If they found silver dollars, they would take them away. If there were none, they would whip and scold them. This time, after being driven back to China, they were beaten and imprisoned in a dark room. Two days later, Japanese police were sent to escort them onto the ship. Their clothes, if of some value, were stripped off. Food and accommodation on the ship were mostly provided by Chinese sailors. The overseas Chinese had no freedom to organize or assemble in Japan, so the embassy had no knowledge of the expulsion of the overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Petitioned the City Party Headquarters <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Wu Wentian, Xu Baonian, Xu Zijin, and others led all the overseas Chinese to petition the City Party Headquarters. Yu Yaoqiu of the Party Headquarters received them and promised to introduce them to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for reception. The text of their petition is recorded as follows: "Submitting this petition because of bankruptcy and destitution, we humbly request that you grant us relief to save our lives. We, Wentian, etc., have been running stores and working as sugar and coal workers in Tokyo City, Minami-Senju Town, Nagoya, and other places in Japan for more than ten years. We have followed the rules and regulations and have not committed any illegal acts. Unexpectedly, the Japanese coveted our rights and interests and suddenly, in September, many police officers came and forced us to return to China. We repeatedly requested that they return our accounts and sell our equipment,</p>
<p>so that we could use it as travel expenses. The police turned a deaf ear. If we delayed for a moment,</p>
<p>they would use their fists and feet, or even wooden sticks and gun handles, to beat us arbitrarily. Such rampant and unreasonable behavior is beyond description. We had no choice but to follow them to the police station for more than ten days, where we were not treated as human beings. All the silver dollars in our pockets were confiscated. Those who had married Japanese women were not allowed to bring them back to China. As a result, our clothes were taken off and sold to buy boat tickets. Although we have now arrived in Shanghai, we are unfamiliar with the place, have no clothes to keep us warm, no food to eat, and no place to live. We are wandering on the streets, and our lives are in danger. Fortunately, the owner of an old public inn,</p>
<p>out of sympathy for his fellow countrymen, has temporarily taken us in. Therefore, we are forced to request your assistance, to issue us travel expenses and boat tickets,</p>
<p>so that we, difficult overseas Chinese drifting overseas, can return to our homeland and save our lives. This would be truly virtuous."</p>
<p>China Aviation's Newly Purchased Douglas Aircraft</p>
<h3 id="e117">Trial Flight in the City Today <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, China Aviation's two large Douglas aircraft, newly purchased from the United States and transported to Shanghai, were assembled at the Longhua Airport by Mr. Hayes, a mechanic specially sent from the United States after arriving in Shanghai on the 28th of last month. One aircraft has already been</p>
<h3 id="e118">Assembled <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>and will be test-flown in the city today. The other aircraft is also being assembled by Mr. Hayes and should be completed in about a week. After the test flights of the two new aircraft are successful, the Shanghai-Guangdong air route will be restored immediately. The date of resumption is approximately the beginning of</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Month <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>. In addition, the No. 19 Sikorsky aircraft, which was wrecked by wind and waves in the Xisha Islands while searching for the missing No. 17 Sikorsky aircraft, has now been completely repaired. However, because of the</p>
<h3 id="e120">Difference in Speed <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>is too far, so it cannot keep pace. Therefore, the aircraft is now stored in the Longhua hangar as a backup for occasional needs.</p>
<p>As for the new aircraft required for the Yangtze River route, i.e., the Shanghai-Chengdu route, the delivery has been delayed due to the labor strike in the United States. It will probably not be until the beginning of next year that the new aircraft can be transported here. It has been found that the climate along the Shanghai-Guangdong air route, especially in the Hangzhou Bay area, is</p>
<h3 id="e121">Changing Rapidly <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>and along the way, such as Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Shantou,</p>
<p>Xiamen, and other stations, there are radio meteorological stations. The Hangzhou Bay area, on the other hand, is lacking. Now a radio station has been added in Xiangshan to report the weather every two hours, so that the flight crew can consider it calmly to ensure safety. In addition, for the cause of civil aviation, the company is</p>

<p>the company has specially sent Mr. Liang Jingzhao, an employee of the company, to the United States to investigate the aviation industry, and then to various European countries to conduct investigations, which is expected to last about six to nine months, and then return to China to report on the development of the civil aviation industry in various countries, so as to learn from it.</p>

<p>Replied to the Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai branch of Juxingcheng received a letter of advice from the Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association yesterday, saying that at a time when the Red disaster is serious and people are uneasy, it is not necessary for your bank to jointly establish the Lianyi Company with the British Shandeh Company, and please stop the process immediately. According to the manager of the bank, the Fellow Association received a telegram from the bank's general manager before discussing and deciding, stating that it had formally declared to the British side that it would stop the process. The original letter of reply to the Fellow Association is copied as follows: "Greetings, regarding your association's letter advising our bank to stop using foreign capital, it is because the Red disaster in Sichuan Province is serious, and the suppression of bandits is tense. Most of the funds in Sichuan Province are remitted abroad. How can we talk about investment at this moment? Your association's love for our homeland is extremely admirable, and it coincides with our bank's intention, so we should accept the cessation of the process and notify the Shandeh Company in London to cancel the draft agreement. We are concerned about your attention. This is a special reply. To the Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association."</p>
<p>The Shipping Association is Concerned About Pilotage Fees</p>
<h3 id="e124">Replied to the Inspector General of Customs <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>

At the same time, it sent letters to the Inspector General of Customs, the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, and the Pilotage Management Committee, requesting that the new regulations be temporarily suspended until the Yuan Ministry's approval is received. It then received a reply from Acting Inspector General Luo, instructing it to persuade the shipping companies. After the association forwarded it to the companies, it again detailed the facts and reasons and instructed it to forward it to Acting Inspector General Luo, requesting that it ask for instructions on behalf of the shipping companies to avoid forcing a shutdown and affecting the overall situation.

<p>Greeting in reply, your office's letter No. 1010 was approved, instructing us to persuade all members not to oppose the newly revised pilotage fee rate, so that the matter of China's regaining pilotage rights can proceed smoothly. After forwarding it to all relevant member companies, it has been replied that the pilotage management committee is not entirely under the jurisdiction of the Customs. The shipping companies are aware of this, so they have submitted to the Yuan Ministry and requested that the fees not be increased.</p>
<p>However, the chairman of the committee is the Customs' maritime patrol officer. The reasons for increasing the fees are explained by the chairman, and the Customs is responsible for compulsory enforcement. It is clear that the Customs is the backbone of the committee, even if the committee is not entirely under the jurisdiction of the Customs. Moreover, the points stated by Acting Inspector General Luo are all subjective from the perspective of the pilots, which further proves that the Customs is emphasizing the pilots. Now, the statements that do not conform to the facts in the letter are stated separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chamber of Commerce Representatives Repeatedly Dissented <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>(1) Regarding the statement in the original letter that "Among the committee members, there is a representative recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. During the meeting, it was not heard that he had any objection to the new fee rate," it was found that on May 22 this year,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from Mr. Chen Tianjun (the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce), a member of the committee, stating that the revision of the pilotage fee rate was too large.</p>
<p>He repeatedly stated his opinion at the meeting and also sent a letter to Mr. Xi Liman, the chairman of the committee, on April 4, requesting that the original fee rate be temporarily charged. On June 22, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again sent a proposed fee rate table based on Mr. Chen's letter,</p>
<p>and stated that at the meeting on June 15, the matter concerned the economy of the shipping companies, so it was necessary to solicit the opinions of the shipping companies first, and requested that the increase in the fee rate be temporarily delayed for discussion. The association also prepared opinions and sent them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that Mr. Chen submit them again. Therefore, not only were there early objections, but there were objections, all of which have records that can be verified. It is difficult to acknowledge that there were no objections.</p>
<h3 id="e127">High Pilot Salaries, Many Talents <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>(2) "The previous pilotage fee rate was set too low, so the monthly salary of the pilots was extremely low, sometimes only enough to pay 5 or 15 national currency units. At a time when the standard of living is increasing day by day, it seems that such a salary is not enough to maintain them, and it is necessary to make their lives stable in order to maintain specialized talents, so it is necessary to appropriately increase the salary of the pilots, and the pilotage fee rate has to be revised in order to increase revenue." The monthly salary of long-term pilots hired by various shipping companies is at least one or two hundred yuan or more, and the salary for temporary hires is even more than two or three hundred yuan per trip.</p>
<p>Their income is already so abundant, how can their lives not be stable? There are many pilot specialists in Songhu, so there is no need to recruit them with heavy money. At ordinary times, as soon as there is news that a ship is entering the Yangtze River, pilots with naval department licenses rush to the company to solicit pilotage work. This can prove the abundance of talents,</p>
<p>and also prove the abundance of salaries, so they are happy to take on the job. The statement in Acting Inspector General Luo's reply that the pilots' monthly salary is sometimes only 5 or 15 national currency units is far from the truth and makes it even more difficult for people to understand the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Foreign Pilots Have Never Been Hired <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>(3) "The newly revised fee rate is slightly higher for ships with deeper drafts, but it is still less than half of the fees charged by foreign pilots in Songhu, which are almost three times higher than those of the committee, so it cannot be said to be too high." The newly revised fee rate is indeed more than doubled for ships with deeper drafts. For example, the old price for pilotage of a Chinese ship to and from Songhu once was 450 yuan in foreign currency. Now, according to the new regulations, it must be actually charged 991 yuan and 14 cents in foreign currency to and from two one-way trips, which can prove this. In the past ten years or so, Chinese ships sailing on the Shanghai-Hankou line have never hired foreign pilots, so it does not exist at all. How can it be used as a ratio? Taking a step back, if any public or private enterprise hires Chinese people and must use foreigners as a ratio, it is definitely not something that a country with insufficient public funds and a declining industry and commerce can afford. If this statement is insisted on, it will put the country's economy and the enterprise's consumption</p>
<p>into a desperate situation, and it is not only the shipping companies that cannot bear it.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Regaining Sovereignty Should Reduce Costs <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>(4) "The central government is actively working to regain pilotage rights." The regaining of pilotage rights is divided into two categories: (A) Foreign pilots of the Shanghai Harbor Pilotage Company. These pilots specialize in piloting postal and cargo ships of various countries from the Daji to Shanghai, and from Shanghai to the Daji. Among the dozens of them, there is only one Chinese. Not only is the fee too high, which is opposed by various foreign ships, but also the national defense is completely dismantled, which is a huge concern. The government's plan to restore this pilotage right is originally a legitimate measure, and it is also the purpose of the government to establish the pilotage management committee. Since the committee takes this as its purpose, it should actively proceed with this purpose so as not to fail the state's commission and disappoint the people's hopes. (B) Songhu Pilotage, i.e., the Yangtze River pilotage. Chinese ships do not hire foreign pilots, which has been a long-standing practice. Even foreign firms such as Taikoo and Jardine,</p>
<p>The long-term pilots of various liners sailing on the Yangtze River also employ Chinese people. However, when foreign ships sail to the Chinese border and enter the Yangtze River, there are still Japanese, British, and German people who are employed by the Japanese-established Yangtze River Pilotage Association and other British and German people to act as pilots. It is necessary to regain this point. However, the method should be to reduce the pilotage fee rate for Chinese people in order to abandon the other and take this. If the fee rate is increased in order to regain pilotage, it is simply going south to draw north.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Who is Responsible for Forcing Employment? <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Some say that the pilot is extremely important to the safety of the entire ship. Therefore, when hiring, (1) the shipowner must have absolute trust, (2) the captain</p>
<p>is willing to be responsible to the outside world, and (3) the insurance company that insures the ship's value must approve. If you must overstep your authority and force the shipping company to hire someone they do not want to use, then the shipowner, captain, and insurance company will naturally not be responsible for all the responsibilities and losses that occur due to the pilot's negligence. May I ask if the person who oversteps his authority and forces the employment will be held criminally liable and liable for compensation? This is especially what the companies want to understand. Acting Inspector General Luo sees that the pilots' salaries are very low and takes it as a reason for increasing the rates, which shows the virtue of taking care of the lives of technical and sanitation personnel. However, the result is that it only takes care of a few and abandons the majority, creating a deformity, making it impossible for the original personnel to seek a meager life. Not only does it lose the balance of reason, I am afraid that it runs counter to the principle of equality of the people in the republican country. This is also something that the companies cannot fathom.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Difficult to Revert if the Goal is Not Achieved <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The rest of the reasons have been described in detail in a telegram to the Yuan Ministry.</p>
<p>You should ask the association to copy the draft telegram to Acting Inspector General Luo for investigation to avoid repetition. Please reply to the above and other details. The association replied that the facts stated were consistent and the reasons were sufficient. After receiving the letter, although the association has repeatedly persuaded them not to go to extremes, the companies are concerned about their own pain and the action has been decided by the public. If the goal is not achieved, I am afraid that there is no room for reversion. We are hereby attaching a copy of the telegram to the Yuan Ministry and truthfully forwarding the information. I respectfully hope that you will investigate and consult and</p>
<p>ask for instructions on behalf of the shipping companies to avoid forcing a shutdown and affecting the overall situation. Please reply and wait for a reply. To the Inspector General of Customs.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Methods for Saving the Silk and Yarn Industries <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>And Investigating the Current State of the Silk and Yarn Industries</p>
<p>A Meeting of Yarn Industry Groups Will Be Convened First</p>
<p>Our country's silk and yarn industries are affected by the dumping of foreign goods. Silk factories have almost all ceased operations, and although yarn factories are struggling to maintain operations, they are all suffering losses.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently specially dispatched Section Chief Li Chongdian of the Department of Industry from Beijing to Shanghai to investigate the situation of the two industries and discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>State of Decline (1) The silk industry is affected by the dumping of Japanese silk in Europe and the United States, resulting in a steady decline in the market price of Chinese silk. The price of each dan (unit of weight) of standard silk has fallen to around 400 yuan. The silk produced by silk factories is incurring heavy losses, and they have no choice but to suspend operations and wait for the opportunity. Now, almost all silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have suspended operations. In Shanghai, less than two-tenths of them are still operating. (2) The yarn industry in our country has recently been affected by the decline of the rural economy and the dumping of foreign goods, resulting in a sharp decrease in sales.</p>
<p>All factories have reduced their working hours to maintain operations. This year, new cotton from various places has been put on the market and it is a harvest year. Recently, sales in various places have shown improvement.</p>
<p>Factories that had reduced working hours have resumed one after another, but this is temporary in nature, and the spun yarn is still not profitable.</p>
<p>Undertaking Relief The Ministry, considering the yarn and silk industries to be the most important in our country's industry, has repeatedly convened meetings to discuss relief, but all have been suspended due to limited financial resources. This time, Section Chief Li Chongdian of the Department of Industry was specially dispatched and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. In addition to investigating the current situation of the silk and yarn industries, he is also discussing relief measures with the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau. This has been ongoing for days. It is reported that the Social Bureau will first invite yarn industry groups to hold a joint meeting to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>Municipal Government Ordered</p>
<h3 id="e135">Cooperate in Abolishing Private Postal Bureaus <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Must Be Abolished Uniformly by the End of This Year</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday received an order from the Executive Yuan, which stated that the Ministry of Transportation had reported that private postal bureaus in various provinces and cities were hindering the business of the postal service. Orders to abolish them had been repeatedly issued, and out of consideration, the deadline had been extended to the end of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), and they must be abolished uniformly. This has been ordered again and again. Now that the deadline is approaching, it is feared that the private postal bureaus will use the excuse of needing time to close down and disobey orders again. In addition to ordering the Directorate General of Posts to investigate the current situation of private postal bureaus in various places and report in detail for verification, it is also appropriate to request the Executive Yuan to issue an order to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct military and political organs to effectively cooperate in the abolition, etc.</p>
<p>Based on this, in addition to ordering compliance and separate orders, the Municipal Government is urgently ordered to comply and instruct its subordinates to cooperate in the handling, etc. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Municipal Government yesterday issued instructions to various bureaus to cooperate in the abolition uniformly.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Petition to Grant Amnesty to Liu Chongwu and Others <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Treacherous Merchants Selling Japanese Goods Are No Different from Hastening Their Own Destruction</p>
<p>Patriots Warn Treacherous Merchants Out of Pure Patriotic Zeal</p>
<p>Should Be Forwarded to the National Government for Amnesty</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, for the sake of patriotic men Liu Chongwu and others, who committed crimes out of patriotism and have no way to be helped, yesterday submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, requesting amnesty. The original text is copied below: The petition is submitted for Liu Chongwu and others who committed crimes out of patriotism, have no way to be helped, and request amnesty to maintain human sentiment. According to the proposal of member Ma Junshuo, patriotic men Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, etc., in view of the fact that the scars of the Shanghai War have not yet dried and the Japanese aggression has not ceased, and yet there are treacherous merchants selling Japanese goods, which is no different from hastening their own destruction, then out of righteous indignation, regardless of their own interests, engaged in the work of warning treacherous merchants, believing that this was an act of saving the country from imminent danger, out of necessity, resulting in violating the law.</p>
<p>Network, in tight confinement, the circumstances of which have been successively published in Shanghai newspapers, needless to say. (Omission) However, foreign insults are imminent, and the country is in dire straits. Patriotic actions, if there is no corresponding relief,</p>
<p>It is bound to violate national consciousness and national stance. In European and American countries, in cases involving national affairs crimes, due to the adoption of a jury system, jurors determine the facts, and many can be acquitted. Although this association previously suggested to the judicial authorities, it was approved, but it has not yet been implemented. During this period, the only remedy for patriotic criminals is to request amnesty. It is found that Liu and others are sincere patriotic youths with professional jobs. During the January 28th Incident, they joined the Volunteer Army, risked their lives, and put their personal interests out of consideration long ago. This time, warning treacherous merchants, regardless of the means used, is nothing more than to implement their purpose of saving the country. In the past, Zheng Jicheng in Shandong killed Zhang Zongchang to avenge his father.</p>
<p>Although it was a private feud, he was still granted amnesty. Now, Liu Chongwu and others have forgotten themselves for the sake of the public and stood up to save the country. Their criminal circumstances are even more pitiful than the former. For the sake of the country, for the sake of national consciousness,</p>
<p>For the sake of encouraging patriotism and promoting justice, the government has the necessity of amnesty. This association is in a leading position in society and is responsible for protecting human rights. It has to express its views on patriotic cases that have caused a national sensation. Is it appropriate? It should be voted on, etc. After being submitted to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion, everyone believed that the motive for the crimes of Liu Chongwu and others was purely based on patriotic enthusiasm and had no other personal intentions. Our country has no forgiving legal documents for such crimes in the first place. However, at this time when the country is in dire straits, if patriotic criminals are subjected to such punishment, it will have a great impact on national consciousness and the nation's stance. We should petition the Executive Yuan to forward the petition to the National Government for amnesty of the crimes of Liu Chongwu and others to maintain human</p>
<p>Sentiment is truly for the public good, etc.</p>
<p>In order to study the latest medical science in Europe and the West, he sailed to Germany on an Italian mail ship yesterday (9th). When he returns to China in the future, he will definitely make more contributions to the new medical world.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Autopsy of an Old Man Killed by a Tram <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhongdao, a native of Ningbo, 79 years old, lived at No. 16, Buck Road. At about 2:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, he went out alone for something. Unexpectedly, when he passed Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, he was about to cross the road from north to south. At that time, Sun Zhilan, the driver of tram No. 83 on Route 2, was speeding from the east. He could not brake in time and knocked the old man down. Later, Chinese constable No. 2452 on duty found him and immediately copied the tram number and reported to the Xinzha Police Station by telephone, summoning an ambulance to fly the injured to Renji Hospital.</p>
<p>Medical treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. After an investigation, the body was taken to the Fei Lun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei, appointed by the First Special District Local Court, accompanied forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuji, etc., came to the mortuary to examine the body. According to Sun Zhilan, he had been driving a tram for six years. That day, Yu drove to Chengdu Road, from east to west.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the deceased suddenly came from the opposite side of the tram and crossed the road from north to south. At that time, I was driving at a figure-eight speed, and when I saw him, he was only eight or nine yards away, so Yu could not brake and knocked him down, etc. According to the witness Zhang Ting, 29 years old, from Nanxiang, living at No. 222, Rehe Road, he did not know the driver or the deceased. At that time, Yu was sitting in the car and heard the sound of braking very urgently, knowing that something had happened. Yu immediately poked his head out to see.</p>
<p>I saw that the deceased had been knocked to the ground by the car.

<p>Yu Jicheng, a Hunan native at No. 5, Renshou Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, introduced Fu Liu (over forty years old), an Anhui native, as a female servant on August 17 this year. The night before last, she received a salary of six yuan and went to Huayuan Lane, Jiangwan Road, to visit her cousin. She did not leave until 9:30 p.m. When she was walking on the Songhu Railway track, she was hit and crushed to death by a train from Wusong to Shanghai. Her flesh and blood were blurred, and her death was terrible. A passerby discovered it and reported the crushing situation to the Beizhan Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Director Liang Fuchu immediately sent patrol officer Wang Zhizhang to investigate and reported to the General Bureau, and ordered the local security to report to the court for an autopsy. Gu Wanyun, a fellow villager of the teahouse of the Lawyers Association on Beile Road, donated 60 yuan to pay for the coffin and temporarily placed it in the Anhui Guild Hall, and notified the deceased's family to come to Shanghai to collect it.</p>

<p>Shanghai Pushan Villa has been running various charities for more than 20 years, burying the exposed, giving coffins and medicine, which have a great relationship with humanity and hygiene. Director Wang Junsheng has carefully planned and spared no effort. He also thinks that in the Jiangzhe hinterland, there are many</p>
<p>The custom is to bury coffins without burial, so that the coffins are exposed, and the fields are full of graves, which is very touching. Therefore, since the 17th year of the Republic of China, burials have been held. Over the years, a total of more than 77,000 exposed bodies have been buried, and there are still 70,000 to 80,000 bodies that have not been buried. If you do not try to proceed, it will still be a waste of effort. In order to complete all the work, Wang Jun has worked hard to raise funds and continue to run it, and plans to go to</p>
<p>Jiangzhe to conduct a thorough investigation of the burial situation to show caution. It is heard that work has already started in Jiaxing. However, the expenses are huge and the cost is very high. It is still hoped that charitable gentlemen will generously assist so that thousands of exposed bodies</p>
<p>All can be safely buried in the soil, which is also a great merit.</p>

<p>Saying that Avoiding Default on Rent is Difficult to Avoid Forcing People to Close Down</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, for the sake of solving the market problem, yesterday specifically telegraphed the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Nanjing, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Director Wu of the Municipal Social Bureau, the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Shanghai Banking Association, and other agencies and groups, etc. (Omission) Dear Sirs, The depression in the Shanghai market and the decline of industry and commerce have reached the extreme. Companies and firms are closing down and being liquidated, which is seen every day. Due to currency contraction, falling prices, sluggish sales, high rents, and sluggish finance, nine out of ten are losing money. If we do not seek relief, after the great closure, they will inevitably close down one after another. The prosperous Shanghai will suddenly become a dead market. Thinking of the crisis lurking in the future, we cannot help but shudder. This association is a group of citizens, and we have more firsthand knowledge. For the sake of our duties, we convened a temporary representative meeting on January 16. After discussion, everyone believed that in extraordinary events, extraordinary measures should be used. Extending the great closure is not enough to revive, extending the payment of rent is not enough to avoid forcing people to close down, reducing housing donations is not enough to reduce expenses, collecting housing donations on empty houses is not enough to offset the amount reduced by housing donations, and promoting rent reduction, so it was decided: (A) The great closure of industry and commerce will be extended for one year, with interest paid as usual. (1) Issue a declaration; (2) Submit a petition to the party and government organs for approval (resolution), and send a letter to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry and commerce groups to proceed in unison; (B) Submit a petition to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds from the Central Bank to provide relief to Shanghai's industry and commerce; (C) (1) Submit a petition to the Municipal Government and send a letter to the Public Works Department to collect housing donations on empty houses; (2) Submit a petition to the competent authorities to issue a clear order to delay the payment of rent for six months; Submit a petition to the Municipal Government and send a letter to the Ratepayers Association to reduce housing donations. The record is on file. It is a critical moment for the rise and fall of the Shanghai market. We specifically telegraph you to examine and implement it. The 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai rely on it. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation bows to you.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Mr. Ye Jiaxing, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Federation, Discusses Countermeasures to Revive the City's Economy <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Factory Closures Resulting from Rural Bankruptcy and Sharp Decline in Purchasing Power</p>
<p>Unite with Fellow Businesses to Avoid Speculation</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Federation of Citizens recently issued a declaration to revitalize the city's economy, advocating for measures such as a one-year postponement of industrial and commercial liquidations, interest payments as usual, and deferred rent payments. This has attracted considerable attention from the community. Mr. Ye Jiaxing, a standing committee member of the federation, expressed his views to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, stating that although he had attended the recent standing committee meeting of the Municipal Federation, the agenda was to discuss the association's charter. The issue of reviving the city's economy was not formally addressed. Later, due to other matters, he left the meeting early. He deeply believes that the decline of commerce and the stagnation of the market in the country today is due to the sharp decline in the purchasing power of the people in the agricultural regions, and last year's floods in the north and droughts in the south have intensified the severity of this malady, just as a tuberculosis patient suffers from an external illness. For the present, he believes that the only solution is to make every effort to revitalize the countryside, increase the purchasing power of the people, and enable the smooth sale of various domestic products, while expanding international trade venues, in order to find a way out for foreign trade. This is the fundamental cure for revitalizing the nation's commerce. As for the sluggishness of the city's market and the decline of commerce in this municipality, in addition to the above reasons, there are other factors. One of these is the mutual infighting and destruction among businesses in the same industry. For example, in the rubber industry a few years ago, there were only seven or eight rubber factories in this city, and their business was very good and they were all profitable. However, in the last year or two, the number of rubber factories has sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, increasing to forty or fifty. As a result, the factories are mutually suppressing each other, competing by lowering prices. There is no spirit of unity among businesses in the same industry, and they are even committing suicide. What happened to the rubber industry has also happened to other industries. No wonder the city's market is in decline. Furthermore, several large stores in this city have recently gone bankrupt. The reason for their bankruptcy is not the failure of their main business, but their involvement in businesses outside of their main business. The recent bankruptcy of the Thai Company is a clear example of this. Secondly, the managers of stores in this city often use their position as managers to engage in speculation, some are fortunate enough to create personal wealth, while the stores themselves do not benefit, and unfortunately, due to economic difficulties, they often misappropriate store funds, causing the stores to run aground or go bankrupt. Such situations are endless, and it is a cause for great lament. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the city's business community can from now on strive to unite with their fellow businesses and avoid engaging in side businesses and speculation, which will greatly help the recovery of the market. Moreover, last year, all industries had already liquidated, and it is expected that after the final settlement of the disaster relief, there will be a new and innovative undertaking. Recalling that the Civil Code drafted by the Legislative Yuan included a provision for joint and several liability of partnership stores, which was subsequently amended by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and a Commercial Registration Law was promised to be added to supplement it. This registration law is extremely important for newly established partnership stores. It is hoped that the legislative authorities will promulgate and implement it as soon as possible to benefit the city's commerce.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding reports of escalating tensions in Chahar, the Japanese Embassy here stated that they have not heard anything about it. However, after reading the newspaper, they have already telegraphed Tokyo for inquiries. Before receiving a response, the embassy does not have any definite confirmation. However, they stated that they had inquired with Mr. Suzuki, the military attaché of the embassy, who also had not heard anything about it and believes that there is no possibility of any tension in Chahar between China and Japan, unless there is a small number of remnants of bandits appearing there, but bandits are not a cause for concern and cannot cause a tense situation. Therefore, based on this theory, they believe that reports of tension in Chahar may be a rumor from outside. However, a telegram stated that Xiao Zhenying's inspection of eastern Chahar revealed no action from the Japanese military, but quite a bit of activity. It is impossible to confirm whether the Japanese Embassy genuinely has not heard anything about it.</p>

<p>Unable to Spare Time for the March Parliament</p>
<p>Arita Will Stay in Shanghai and Not Go Elsewhere</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, yesterday's newspaper reported that Japan, feeling diplomatically isolated after withdrawing from the League of Nations and the abolition of the Washington Treaty, in order to improve Sino-Japanese relations and break the impasse in past Sino-Japanese diplomacy, would not hesitate to have Foreign Minister Hirota personally visit China to meet with our government authorities. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the Japanese Consulate in this city to inquire about this matter. According to Iwai, this statement is not entirely accurate, as the Japanese parliament on March 20 will be held as scheduled. Both before and after the parliament, he will be very busy and unable to travel far. Moreover, from the perspective of recent Sino-Japanese diplomacy, Foreign Minister Hirota seems to have no need to visit China. As for the rumor that Foreign Minister Hirota instructed Consul General Suma to convey to Minister Arita to conduct negotiations with the Chinese government, this is probably also not true. Suma went to Nanjing by train the day before yesterday (17th) to discuss commercial issues with the diplomatic authorities of the Nanjing government, and there were no other discussions. Minister Arita will remain in Shanghai recently and will not go elsewhere for the time being.</p>

<p>Second-Period Settlement at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief General Donation Association received many letters and telegrams from various provinces and regions, stating that the drought and gambling disasters were extremely severe, and requested that more funds be raised for relief. The association was originally scheduled to end operations at the end of the month, but because the disaster areas are so widespread, a drop in the bucket is of no help. The second meeting the other day specifically decided to continue operations, strive to raise funds from all sides, hoping to obtain a large sum of money to provide general relief to the disaster victims. This has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. To facilitate donations from all walks of life, the association has entrusted various newspapers, banks, money shops, companies, stores, cinemas, entertainment venues, Chinese and Western pharmacies, silk shops, restaurants, photography studios, automobile dealerships, etc. to collect donations. Since the implementation, the enthusiastic participation of various stores has been well received, and the results have been remarkable. The first-period settlement of donations paid to the association was very enthusiastic. It is reported that the association sent letters to newspapers and banks yesterday, requesting them to continue handling donations and extend the period, and the donations received will be used for the second-period settlement at the end of this month and submitted to the association first, so that they can be distributed to the disaster areas.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association received 50 yuan from the Duck Slaughtering Industry Association, 4 yuan from the Da Lai Automobile Company, 3 yuan in silver dollars and 61 cents in small silver dollars from Tangyan Primary School. Also, donations sent by workers include 200 yuan in silver dollars collected by the Shanghai Bank on behalf of the Fifth District Cotton Spinning Industry Association, 60 yuan from the Shenghe Long Oil Press Factory. In addition, the association received 21 yuan and 5 jiao in silver dollars from the staff of Jiangnan Paper Company, 13 yuan and 7 jiao from the employees of Jiangnan Paper Company, 83 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen from the workers of Jiangnan Paper Company, and 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen from Sanyou Industrial Society.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Declaration of the Shanghai Newspaper Industry Union <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>In 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army established itself in Shanghai and Nanjing, and the people's movement swept across the country, the newspaper workers, on the one hand, were aware of their own disunity and lack of organization, and on the other hand, felt that the National Revolution was a revolution of the entire people, and that everyone had the right and opportunity to participate in politics. Based on the above two reasons, our union was organized. Over the years, in the spirit of sincere unity of our workers and the principle of labor-management cooperation, we have strived to enhance the status of the workers themselves, improve their living conditions, and advance their work skills, in order to cultivate a spirit of self-governance, and establish workers' schools for the children of workers to have the opportunity to attend school. All these things have always been the consistent proposition of our union, and we have never forgotten them.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, when foreign invaders invaded and the eastern provinces were lost, the national consciousness of the people throughout the country has declined. Fortunately, the central comrades have united sincerely, maintained composure and prudence, and have a plan to deal with the national crisis: first pacify the interior, and to pacify the interior, we must first eliminate the Communist Party. The recent suppression of the communist bandits in Jiangxi, although it is due to the collapse of the communist party's own theory and its unsuitability for China, is also due to the wisdom of Chairman Chiang and the lives of the officers and soldiers, which is enough to show that our central government is becoming more stable and the national consciousness is becoming stronger, and the revival of the Chinese nation is within reach. The members of our union adhere to the Three Principles of the People, and never forget the responsibility of saving the country and the nation. We will follow the central government's intention, under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People and Chairman Chiang, and strive to fulfill the responsibility of saving the Chinese nation. Therefore, at the beginning of the 16th session of the Executive Committee of our union, we hereby declare the proposition of our union, and we hope that all sectors will understand it. This is our declaration. Shanghai Newspaper Industry Union, January 18, 1935.</p>

<p>The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Decided to Hold a Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Before the issue of factory inspections in the concessions is resolved, the French Concession Municipal Council hastily formulated regulations for the management of motor vehicles and machinery, and arbitrarily conducted inspections of factories in the concession. Yesterday, it also issued a notice refusing any organization to investigate (see the advertising column), which infringes on our national sovereignty and disregards everything. The Mechanical National Goods Factory Union, based on the resolution of the second meeting of the eighth session of representatives, and the notice issued by the police department, that any organization or individual other than the French authorities is refused inspection of factories in the French Concession, which infringes on our national sovereignty, expressed their determination to oppose it to the death. Therefore, at 3:30 PM yesterday, they sent representatives Cheng Shouzhong and Gu Xiyuan to the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association to petition, demanding (1) that the management regulations be temporarily suspended, and (2) that they be resubmitted for review. After arriving at the Taxpayers' Association, they were received by Chinese Committee Member Cheng Zhusun, who expressed acceptance of the two demands of the representatives and promised to convene a special meeting of all Chinese directors and committee members on Monday (21st) afternoon to discuss this matter specifically, in order to achieve the protection of sovereignty. At the same time, they also decided to submit the police department's notice to the meeting for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Yu Qiaqing Discusses How the Shanghai-Ningbo Route Issue Was Resolved <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The Mingxing Steamer Company Will Open Scheduled Services First on Behalf of the Xinjingtian Steamer</p>
<p>Invitations Issued to Various Sectors to Visit on the 21st</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Sanbei Company acted as an agent for the Mingxing steamer to operate on the Ningbo route, including Wan Ningbo. Later, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ning Shao Steamship Company separately sent letters to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, requesting the bureau to suspend the issuance of the route license to the steamer. The bureau then forwarded the letters to the Sanbei Company, ordering them to respond. Later, Mr. Peng, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, invited the main personnel of the three companies to the bureau on the 12th of this month to discuss how to resolve this matter. No announcement has been made yet, and people from all walks of life are very concerned. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, General Manager of the Sanbei Company, at the company yesterday to inquire about this matter. He was received and told the following: In the afternoon of the 12th of this month, I (referring to himself) went to the bureau at the invitation of Mr. Peng, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau. Those present included Mr. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Mr. Yuan Fudeng, Manager of the Ning Shao Steamship Company. I then asked Director Peng whether today's meeting was to discuss the issue of suspending the issuance of the route license. Peng replied that today we have invited the three companies to discuss cooperation methods, not to suspend the issuance of the route license. I then asked the two representatives of Liu and Yuan whether they had seen the Sanbei Company's reply to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. If there were any discrepancies, they could be raised for discussion. Both representatives of Liu and Yuan acknowledged that the sections stated in the Sanbei Company's reply were factual. I then said that since you two believe that the Sanbei Company has a reason, then there is nothing inappropriate about the application. In general, the advanced shipping countries divide route licenses into three categories: ocean, coastal, and river, and there are no restrictions. There is no reason to refuse the route license based on the government's intentions. Representative Liu then said that he had tasted it with Minister Zhu, and during the preparation period for cooperation, if the Mingxing steamer insisted on sailing Shanghai-Ningbo, the route license must be suspended. I replied that it was very good. The Mingxing steamer sailing Shanghai-Zhenhai, including Wan Ningbo, was entirely for the purpose of providing relief to rural areas and facilitating transportation. I have repeatedly stated that I am willing to sacrifice the principle of making slight profits at high prices. Moreover, I do not understand which laws and regulations this violates. Does the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have to restrict the route if it has a ship sailing on it? I am for the... even if the government considers it a violation of the order, the company will not hesitate to go bankrupt. Moreover, to take a step back, even if the Maritime Affairs Bureau approves the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's intention and suspends the issuance of the Mingxing Shanghai-Ningbo route license, the Sanbei Company will suspend the Mingxing steamer for a long time to wait for a fair resolution. Among the route licenses of the other steamers of the Sanbei Company, there are about 20 ships with Shanghai-Ningbo routes. It is also possible to send a ship to sail. Will the Maritime Affairs Bureau cancel all of these route licenses? Director Peng then reiterated the previous remarks on cooperation. I am extremely in favor of cooperation. Moreover, the Mingxing's sailing on Shanghai-Zhenhai including Wan Ningbo completely contains the doctrine of saving the countryside, not for profit. Therefore, if it reaches the point where the tariff on the transfer of local products transported by Chinese ships is waived at the trading ports, or if the Yangtze River cooperation contract is established, the Sanbei Company can stop the Mingxing steamer from sailing to Shanghai-Zhenhai. Representative Liu then said that the Yangtze River cooperation contract could be signed in about two months. I then replied that this was not far off. I can make peaceful concessions within the scope possible without violating the doctrine of saving the countryside. Representative Liu then said that the Shanghai-Ningbo four companies could hold another meeting to discuss. I then expressed my approval and went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and invited a representative from Jardine Matheson to the bureau to discuss it together. After discussion, it was agreed that the Shanghai-Ningbo four companies' cooperation contract would continue as before. On the one hand, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be responsible for signing the Yangtze River cooperation contract within two months. The Mingxing steamer will first replace the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinjingtian steamer for one month starting from the 22nd of this month. After the expiration, it will replace the Ning Shao Steamship Company's Xin Ning Shao steamer for one month. If the two-month period expires and the Yangtze River cooperation contract has not yet been finalized, the Sanbei Company will sail on its own until the day the tariff on the transfer of local goods is waived. It will be diverted to the Yangtze River. During the period of replacing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ning Shao Steamship Company, the profits and losses will be borne by each company. The Sanbei Company will only charge ship rental, and all the crew members of each ship and the personnel of the business department, as well as the waiters in each cabin, will be handled by the personnel designated by the Sanbei Company and cannot be changed. As a solution, the Ning Shao Steamship Company's Xin Ning Shao Zhenhai will berth at the Sanbei Wharf. The reporter then asked what other important relationships you have for sailing the Shanghai-Zhenhai route, besides saving the rural areas of Shanghai. Can you tell us a few? Qing replied that in addition to saving rural areas, there are three points in sailing the Shanghai-Zhenhai route. The first point is to reduce the burden of local products. The second point is to save time for small passengers. The third point is that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is about to be completed, and goods transported from Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces can be exported from Zhenhai. Therefore, with these three points, our company will not hesitate to sacrifice everything. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should not oppose this matter. It is reported that the Mingxing steamer will replace the Xinjingtian steamer on the 22nd of this month. On the morning of the day before, the Sanbei Company will invite people from all walks of life to visit the steamer at the Jinliyuan Ningbo Wharf at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Chinese and Foreign Benevolent Relief Association Reports Family of Disaster Victims in Haining Died by Poisoning <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>All Sectors Hope to Extend a Helping Hand</p>
<p>Wang Yusan, Ph.D. in Political Science and Sociology from [location redacted], visited the Chinese and Foreign Benevolent Relief Association on Renji Road yesterday. He told the association that near Haining, there was a family of seven, including a couple and their children. Due to the early famine, they had eaten everything and pawned everything, and had not been able to cook for three days. A neighbor, hearing this, found it difficult to sit idly by and divided several liters of rice to help them out of their immediate predicament. However, when her husband returned, he said that this little bit was not enough for them to take care of themselves, let alone give it to others. How would their family survive? The two quarreled, and their voices reached outside the house. The villager's family knew about this, so they returned the original rice. Another neighbor, learning of the situation, and that both the husband and wife were groaning, found a yuan left in the cotton wadding, though it was not used for medicine, and generously lent it to them in hopes of saving their family's lives. However, although the villager obtained this yuan, he still felt unable to survive in this environment. He suddenly had a pessimistic thought and immediately bought two jiao of broken rice and eight jiao of sodium bicarbonate, cooked porridge and took it all, resulting in the death of all seven members of the family. The tragedy spread throughout the village, and everyone was shocked. Dr. Wang also said that there are still 1,500 households in Haining that must be saved. The provincial relief is limited and slow to help. At present, the relief provided is 200 yuan per day, and it would only take 6,000 yuan to help them for a month, which can definitely save lives. It is said that the association has repeatedly increased the allocation of funds for emergency relief in Haining and has jointly distributed them with the Jisheng Association. It has only just been completed, but such a tragedy has occurred. It is a sign that the disaster is severe and the funds are meager, and it is difficult to achieve a thorough solution. If all sectors extend a helping hand, it will be a timely and supreme act of merit in this cold weather.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Jisheng Association Takes Over Emergency Relief in Haiyan <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association has completed the emergency relief in Haining and is now taking over the relief efforts in Haiyan. In this cold weather, disaster victims are everywhere, and a small amount of relief funds and clothing is difficult to popularize. There are too many monks and too little porridge, and it is inevitable that some will feel disappointed. In the blink of an eye, next spring will come, and there will be a shortage of food. Even if we only consider the nearby Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the severity of the disaster areas, the number of disaster victims, the lack of food and clothing, how can they support life and spend their days? Moreover, with life hanging by a thread, how can they plant seeds in the fields and hope for spring plowing? The cries of the hungry are unbearable all day long. Those who have children who can be sold or can escape to other places are still able to save their lives. The dead are gone, and what can they say? At this time of extreme anxiety and before the ditches are filled, we hope that people in society will save the money spent on Spring Festival banquets and use it for disaster relief, so that the disaster victims will benefit greatly. This is especially what we hope for from charitable comrades.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Moral Society Goes to Jurong to Distribute Relief <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Chinese Moral Society believes that the drought in Jurong, Jintan, and Danyang counties in the year of Jiaxu (1934) was extremely severe, and the autumn harvest was completely lost. In this cold winter, there are cries of woe everywhere, waiting to be fed. Therefore, it was decided to send personnel to the three places to investigate and distribute relief. It has been decided to send Director of Investigation and Relief Fu Yiting, and Investigation and Relief Personnel Wan Desheng, who departed yesterday afternoon, starting with Jurong, and providing relief according to the severity of the disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e164">A Western Employee of Jardine Matheson Forced a Chinese Worker to His Death, the National Seamen's Association Provides Support <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Tian Hou, a worker in the middle cabin of the Xianghe steamer of Jardine Matheson, had missed the ship in Shanghai and took the Longhe steamer to Beijing to catch up. He was forced to disembark at Xiaguan, and the Xianghe steamer had already set sail. He then took the Longhe steamer again. When the worker boarded the ship in Shanghai, he originally paid one yuan and one jiao to buy a half-price ticket. The second time he boarded the ship from Beijing, he could not buy a ticket because he had no money left. He was caught by a Western ticket inspector named Niumen. Despite Tian's explanation, the Westerner not only did not sympathize with a fellow seaman from the same company, but also beat him and humiliated him in every way, insisting on paying for the ticket. Tian, being forced and helpless, threw himself into the river. The passengers on the ship, seeing this situation, were outraged and immediately ordered the captain to stop the ship and rescue him, but he was already barely breathing. When they arrived in Wuhu, he was already dead. The body was collected in Wuhu, and the results of the court's examination showed that Tian had been injured before his death and drowned. This case has now aroused the indignation of seamen across the country, who have decided to unite to provide assistance and organize a tragedy committee to handle the negotiations. The Chinese Seamen's Union has been receiving messages from seamen's organizations in various places, stating that this case is not only about the abuse of Chinese workers, but also about international grief. They are now conducting detailed investigations and collecting material evidence, and as soon as the matter is settled, they will seriously raise the issue for negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Tobacco Industry Association Appeals for Its Members <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Maintain Original Tax and Avoid Increases</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association has repeatedly received reports from its members, such as Wan Maoxiang, that after donating and receiving licenses for Spring-type tobacco, officials from the Municipal Southern Tax Collection Office have sent personnel to investigate and plan to collect taxes at a higher rate. At a time when the market is sluggish, business is depressed, and many are closed, it is difficult for our members to maintain even with paying taxes at the original rate, and they are unable to pay more. Therefore, we request that you forward this request to the authorities to maintain the original amount. The association has already forwarded a letter to Director Cai of the Finance Bureau, stating, "Presenting a request based on the facts, we hope that the authorities will sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants and send personnel to reinvestigate and order the office to maintain the original amount and avoid increasing it." We have received statements from fifteen tobacco shops, such as Wan Maoxiang, that the licenses they have obtained have been gradually increased in both the autumn and winter commissions, and recently the tax authorities have sent personnel to the shops again, ordering them to increase the spring commission according to the original amount. The merchants hope to reduce the burden at a time when the market is sluggish and business is depressed, so that they can maintain their lives. If they are to be increased again, they will be unable to pay. If they can develop their business, they will naturally obey the order to increase it. Please ask the association to forward the request to the tax bureau, grant them sympathy, and allow them to pay taxes as before, in order to maintain their livelihood. The association has verified the statements of the shops one by one, and the statements of the shops are all true. We are forwarding a detailed note on each shop, and we hope that you will examine and approve it, sympathize with the difficulties of the merchants, send personnel to reinvestigate according to the list, order the Municipal Southern Tax Collection Office to allow the shops on the list to maintain the original amount, and avoid increasing it. We also ask for your approval, so that we can inform them. Again, we thank you. We also sent a letter to Director Liang of the Municipal Southern Tax Collection Office (similar in content).</p>

<p>The Boatman's Association Presented the Maritime Affairs Bureau to Negotiate Compensation</p>
<p>Barge No. 12169 of Zhu Xianji Barge Company in this city, loaded with 50 tons of Hongqi coal, was towed by the Longxing small steamer. At about 4:00 PM on January 15, it was passing through Zhongzhan, Dongjiadu, heading towards Puxi. At that time, the Japanese-owned Dalian Steamship Company's Bojin Maru was turning its head to exit, piloted by the Nanyang small steamer. At this time, the ship's body was across the center of the river, and suddenly it began to reverse. The stern of the ship hit the Puxi side. The Longxing small steamer continuously sounded its whistle to warn, but the Bojin Maru still reversed. The ship's stern finally capsized the coal boat, and the goods and property were completely submerged, causing great losses. Now, the owner Zhu Xianrui has reported it to the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association for relief. The association has reported to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for record, sent personnel to investigate, and negotiated with the Dalian Steamship Company for compensation.</p>

<p>The relationship with the Jai Alai stadium needs to be investigated</p>
<p>The Civil Court believes there is a need for supervision</p>
<p>Lu Xihou, Chairman of the China Industrial Bank, was arrested after the bank went bankrupt and has been tried several times. In order to protect the interests of creditors, the court ruled to partially suspend the trial procedures for Lu Xihou, Sun Xiren, and Lu Mengxiang. Lu Xihou was allowed to post a cash bail of 20,000 yuan and a guarantee bond of 30,000 yuan to suspend his detention, so that he could go out to settle debts, and then his settlement results would be used as a reference for the judgment. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, when Lu was preparing the funds to post bail the day before, he was with lawyers Fan Gang and Wu Kun because he had been subject to civil court liquidation, and waited for questioning in the Civil Sixth Court. Judge Yu Changzi held a court hearing and asked Lu whether he had invested in the Jai Alai stadium and the dog racing track. Lu replied that he had no relationship with the Jai Alai stadium, but he had had more than a thousand shares in the dog racing track, which had been pledged to the Si Ming Bank for 50,000 yuan. The total amount owed to others was about 900,000 yuan, while the amount owed to him was more than 1 million yuan. Although it was an old debt, he could still recover more than 100,000 yuan. At the same time, there was also a pledge of 150,000 yuan to the Si Ming Bank, an advance payment of 150,000 yuan from the Qun Yi Banking Syndicate, and more than 100,000 yuan in deposits from relatives and friends. If the two were offset, he only owed about 500,000 yuan, so he planned to pay off half of it first, paying half to all creditors, regardless of size. After verifying the confession, Judge Yu ruled that it was still necessary to investigate whether Lu Xihou had any shares in the Jai Alai stadium, and ordered that Lu be kept in custody. Therefore, Lu Xihou was still unable to regain his temporary freedom.</p>

<p>Due to disputes over cigarette paper and ink</p>
<p>Even threatened to tie them up and throw them into the sea</p>
<p>Chen Shaozhong from Yancheng, who claims to be a counselor of the 26th Division of the 43rd Army in Sichuan, aged 39, cooperated with the Japanese Mizuno in the purchase of 100 boxes of cigarette paper worth 28,000 yuan between March 17 and July of last year, and also acted as an agent for the pledge of 2,500 yuan in silver dollars for ink from Ju Xingcheng. On the morning of the 15th of this month at about 8:00 am, he was driven by the Japanese Mizuno to a three-story pavilion room at No. 7, Lane 24, near the Shanghai Sanatorium Branch on Haining Road, and guarded by the Japanese Kai Ya Da and Zhang Ziren from Suqian, who forced him to hand over the cigarette paper, ink, and other items, or repay 30,000 yuan in silver dollars, and threatened him with a handgun, otherwise he would be tied up and thrown into the sea to his death. Chen was unable to escape the detention until about 9:00 pm the night before, when he took advantage of the guards dozing off and wrote a letter with a pencil, added a few copper coins, and threw it out of the window. Someone picked it up and reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. The chief of police, knowing that the house belonged to a Japanese merchant, immediately sent West Patrol Chief Whitestone and Chinese Detective Wang Runhe to notify the Japanese Consulate and secretly dispatched Japanese detectives to the address to go upstairs, rescue Chen, and arrest the Japanese Kai Ya Da and the Chinese Zhang Ziren, and bring them back to the police station. Kai Ya Da was sent to the Japanese Consulate for disposal, Zhang was detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Third Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Municipal Council stated the situation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 316, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of obstructing freedom, requesting a postponement, etc. According to the victim Chen Shaozhong's testimony of the events, the defendant claimed to be a foreman in the Japanese-owned oil factory, and the rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered that he be remanded in custody and rescheduled for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>According to Dagongshe, the weather has been irregular recently, and various infectious diseases are most likely to develop. Recently, Kala-azar has suddenly been discovered in the Jiangbei area of ​​Suzhou Province, with many patients. The National Seaport Quarantine Administration, considering it a matter of public health, has recently strictly prevented its spread. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>According to Mr. Wu Liande, Director of the Administration, speaking to a reporter from Dagongshe yesterday, the infectious disease discovered in the Jiangbei area of ​​Suzhou Province is Kala-azar in medicine, known as (BIackFeuer) in English, which is caused by people's lack of hygiene. It starts with a slight fever, then the abdomen gradually swells, as large as a pregnant woman, resembling leprosy, and is extremely easy to spread. It is prevalent in the tropical areas of Burma and Annam. It has also been discovered in Shandong and other provinces of China, but it is not the black plague (BIackdeath) reported in the news. This administration has strictly prevented its development.</p>
<p>Establish clinics for treatment at any time. The Jiangbei area is mostly rural, so most of those infected with Kala-azar are farmers. The Ministry of Health believes that infectious diseases must be eradicated, so it has sent Dr. Sun Zhirong from this office to establish clinics and actively treat patients. In the shortest possible time, there may be hope for eradication. According to the current observation of the disease, it does not seem to spread excessively. There are already considerable precautions in this city.</p>

<p>Wandering in Shanghai with Regret</p>
<p>Dying of Poverty and Illness in a Foreign Land</p>
<p>Cao Ada, a young woman from Kunshan, aged twenty-four, has a habit of eating red pills. Recently, she has been wandering outside, lying down all day long. She was first married to Wang, who ordered her to quit the habit, but after several times of sending her to the hospital, the result was the opposite, and the addiction became even more serious than before. Wang had no choice but to divorce her. This ignorant rural woman, once deeply addicted to opium, was first not tolerated by her family, and after leaving her husband, she was dissatisfied with her destiny, and wandered alone, living under the doorway of Li Kou, ending her life in destitution, only increasing her sadness. The day before yesterday, she moved again to the entrance of Liu's Tomb in Jiumudi, lying on the ground, unable to get up due to illness, in a very miserable state. She begged passersby to write a letter for her to notify her brother-in-law to take her home. She claimed to be Cao Ada and recounted her past, deeply regretting that she had gone astray, resulting in this outcome. She asked to send a letter to Cao Yongxing's pig shop in the South City Bank of Chaoyangmen, Kunshan, to be received by her brother-in-law Cao Zaifeng. In the letter, please state that the letter is not for other matters, because my sister is wandering in a foreign land, unfamiliar with the people and place, unable to call for help. Recently, she has been seriously ill and cannot move an inch. I beg my brother-in-law to have mercy and help the fallen person, and take me back to my hometown. I will repay you greatly in the future. I am currently sick at the entrance of Liu's Tomb in Jiumudi, Shanghai. Please come quickly after seeing the letter, and take me back. If you delay, I am afraid we will not meet again. After speaking, her eyes were full of tears, regret and sadness intertwined, and she wept and recounted the situation. The onlookers were like a wall, and they all sighed with pity. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, someone caught a glimpse of Cao Ada already dead. The incident was discovered by the Shenxiangge Police Station in the Old North Gate, which ordered the Jiumudi Bao Jia Pingyang to report to the District Court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Kong Xianglin, entrusted by the court, arrived at the scene with the coroner and other personnel. After examining the body of the deceased Cao Ada (female), who was wearing old clothes and covered with sores, with emaciated muscles, it was determined that she had died of illness. A death sentence was issued, and the coffin was sealed at the funeral home, waiting for relatives to claim it. Later, a kind-hearted person asked the local Bao Jia to send a letter to Cao Zaifeng, the owner of Cao Yongxing's pig shop in Chaoyangmen, Kunshan, to come to Shanghai to claim the coffin, so that the remains could be transported back to their hometown for burial.</p>

<p>Moving things in, gladly opening the door</p>
<p>Drawing a gun, ransacking the boxes</p>
<p>Zheng Shengquan, a Ningbo native residing at No. 1 Jixin Lane, No. 71 East Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, is 47 years old. He acts as a sub-landlord, living in the room behind the living room, and renting out the remaining rooms upstairs. Recently, the tenant of the entire three-story building moved out, so he posted a rental notice at the entrance of the lane. On the morning of the 16th, a man with a local accent came to Zheng's house to rent the house, inspected it, and left without making a decision, but he had already looked up and down. On the afternoon of the 17th, the man went to inspect the house again, and paid a deposit of one silver dollar, renting the house and agreeing to move in the next day. At noon yesterday, the man came to Zheng's house again, claiming to be moving things in, and asked to open the gate. Zheng's family did not suspect anything and gladly opened the gate. Suddenly, three robbers wearing black long gowns, speaking in Chongming, Ningbo, and local accents, rushed in, brandishing three handguns and threatening the victims not to make a sound. The man who had called to open the door also joined the gang. Zheng and his family, seeing the guns, were afraid and dared not speak, allowing the group to enter the room, ransack the boxes, and search Zheng's body. They were robbed of clothes, jewelry, and about 300 yuan in cash. After obtaining the stolen goods, the robbers fled. Afterwards, the victim submitted a list of losses and reported it to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation. The chief of police, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched patrol officer Wu Lianrong to investigate, and ordered all patrol officers to strictly arrest the robbers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Red Pill Trademark Also Has English and Indicates German Manufacture <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>A secret mill was raided on Park Road</p>
<p>Many people are involved, and the hearing is postponed</p>
<p>Wu Hanzhang, a Chinese detective in the Narcotics Division of the General Police Station, recently discovered that someone had secretly set up a red pill mill and secretly selling on No. 88 Renxin Lane, No. 253 Park Road. He sent an informant, posing as a customer, to obtain a sample package and inquire about the price: six yuan and five jiao for a bag of 1,000 pills. At that time, they agreed to pay 65 yuan and sell 10 bags of red pills, totaling 10,000 pills, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The informant returned to report to Detective Wu, who reported to the First Special Court and signed a search warrant. On the day before yesterday, they secretly went to No. 88 Renxin Lane and waited at the entrance. At the same time, they sent an informant inside, pretending to buy, and contacted the woman Xu Yang, who told her mother, Xu Wu, to call 3247 (i.e., Yitaiyong Coal Store, No. 48 Pushi Road, French Concession) to send the goods from the mill. Before long, a Ningbo native Hu Jinsheng arrived carrying a charcoal basket. Just as he was about to enter the room, he was arrested by detectives outside the door. Ten bags of red pills were found in the coal, weighing five and a half pounds, and the two women were arrested and searched. No prohibited items were found. Then, according to Hu's confession, they went with detectives from the French Police Station to the Yitaiyong Coal Store and found 26 pounds of red pills, three taels of powder, two pounds of coffee essence, one batch board of red pills, and two tins of red pill pigment on top of the firewood. At that time, only one Ningbo woman, Zhang Wang, was arrested. Later, Hu Jinsheng confessed that the red pills were obtained from the Shidai Pharmacy at No. 21 Jinshou Lane, Shandong Road. Chinese and Western detectives went to the Shidai Pharmacy and arrested accomplices Zhang Zinan, a Ningbo native, and his brother Zhang Ziqing (formerly a doctor). Sixteen pounds of raw materials, five bottles of rubber, weighing five and a half pounds, and five tins of coffee acid were found under the bed in the back room and taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Eighth Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stood up and stated the case, and said that the trademark of the red pills seized in this case was Shuangshi Horse Brand, and it was also marked with English letters, saying that the goods were excellent and manufactured in Germany. It was also found that the person in charge was Liu Chongfa, the manager of Yitaiyong Coal Store, who is now at large. Therefore, he requested permission to detain the defendants and postpone the trial. Judge Liu Yugui briefly interrogated Xu Yang and the other six people. Their confessions mostly evaded responsibility. He then ordered that they be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Zhang Guanghua Denies Killing His Younger Brother <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The trial opened yesterday to take statements</p>
<p>The case needs further study</p>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a Henan native who previously worked in the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, aged 27, and his 18-year-old younger brother Zhang Guangzhou lived together in the three-story pavilion room of Ningbo woman Dai Chen's house at No. 24 Chongde Lane, Minguo Road, outside the Xiaobeimen of the French Concession. On November 22 of last year, Zhang Guanghua's job was terminated, so he resigned from the house to the sub-landlord, planning to return to Henan with his brother in five or six days. That night, the two brothers still slept in the same room. At 5:00 am the next morning, Zhang Guangzhou was suddenly killed by a knife cut to the neck. At the same time, Zhang Guanghua also suffered five or six knife wounds to the head, jumped out of the window and shouted for help, and called to open the door and windows of the two-story pavilion room, where Haiyan native Yan Jintao lived. The relatives of the sub-landlord, Dan Bingchang and Lin Shengxiang, went out to report to the police station, and Guanghua was sent to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, Guangzhou's body was taken to the coroner's office to request the Second Special Court to send someone to verify it. Since there were no relatives in Shanghai, the body was buried by the charity hall. Later, Guanghua recovered from his injuries and was brought back by the police station for strict investigation. It was determined that Guangzhou was indeed killed by Guanghua, and Guanghua was sent to the Second Special Court for public prosecution on charges of murder. On the 8th of this month, Judge Xiong Huiping held a trial and interrogated the witnesses Dai Chen, Yan Jintao, Dan Bingchang, Lin Shengxiang, etc., and then issued an order to postpone the retrial. The details have been reported in detail in the Japanese newspaper. During the postponement, the presiding judge Xiong personally went to the scene of the incident to investigate and inquire about the events at the time. Yesterday was the date of the continued trial. Judge Xiong and clerk Tao opened the Criminal Second Court to hear the case again. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong of the Police Department appeared in court, and the defendant Zhang Guanghua also hired a lawyer to defend him. The defendant's father Zhang Wenfu also came to court to listen. According to Zhang Guanghua, our brothers have always had a good relationship. Q: Why did such a tragedy happen? A: I was injured and escaped. I don't know that I turned off the lights and went to sleep at night. Someone used a knife to cut my head in my sleep. I woke up and got up, but I couldn't open the door, so I jumped out of the window and shouted for help. This person also cut my younger brother. Q: Did your younger brother cut you? A: There was no light, so I couldn't see clearly. I was sleeping on the bed by the east window, with my feet facing the door, and my head covered with a blanket. My right shoulder was down and my left shoulder was up. At this point, the witnesses were interrogated one by one. Their statements were the same as those reported earlier. The official then said to the defendant, now it is proved that there was no third person in your room. According to various observations, it is presumed that your brother cut you, and you fought back, which is reasonable. And you admitted this when you were moving out. Zhang replied, our brothers have always been harmonious, and he is very obedient to me. If he didn't obey me, I could have asked him to live elsewhere. How could I have harmed my own brother? At this point, the official said that the case still needed detailed study, and ordered the clerk to read the transcripts of the statements of each person, sign them, and then ordered that the case be postponed for further interrogation. The defendant was still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Zhu Liqing Case Opened in Execution Court Yesterday <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Le Songxiong Has Not Yet Paid Alimony</p>
<p>The court will schedule another subpoena</p>
<p>Zhu Liqing, a girl from Nanjing, lives at No. 30 Datong Lane, Yaozhu Road, French Concession. She received higher education and is proficient in both Chinese and Western languages. In the spring of 1919 of the Republic, she was hired by Le Zhenbao, a Ningbo native who owns the Taichang Wood Shop on Nanjing Road, as an English teacher. At that time, Le Zisongxiong, who was the film department buyer of the Pacific Fair, saw that Zhu was talented and beautiful, and couldn't help but desire her. He pursued Zhu in every way. In 1919, he invited Zhu to visit the famous scenic spots in Hangzhou and had an ambiguous relationship. In April of the following year, Zhu gave birth to a daughter, named Zhi'er by Songxiong. At the same time, Songxiong and Zhu rented a house at No. 598 Laoshenfu Road and lived together. By October 1921, Zhu gave birth to another daughter, named Ren'er. Since Zhu and Le lived together, their relationship was very harmonious, and she was very happy that she would be with him for the rest of her life. Unexpectedly, the beautiful scene did not last long. Since last autumn, Le suddenly changed his attitude towards Zhu, treating her like an old fan. Zhu had no choice but to hire lawyer Xue Jiaqi to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting that the defendant Le Songxiong be ordered to pay living expenses of 12,000 yuan and return the advance payment of 1,500 yuan. Judge Ma Yishu heard the case several times. The defendant Le Songxiong also hired lawyer Yan Yinwu to represent him in court, and filed a counterclaim, requesting that the court order a separation from Zhu and hand over the two daughters to Le for support. The case has been decided, ordering the defendant Le Songxiong to pay the plaintiff Zhu Liqing alimony of 6,000 yuan, return the advance payment, and pay monthly living expenses of 60 yuan during the appeal period. The defendant's lawsuit was dismissed. However, the defendant has not yet paid. Yesterday morning was the civil enforcement period, and Judge Shu issued a subpoena to both parties for enforcement. As for the 120 yuan for two months' living expenses during the appeal period, as only Miss Zhu attended the court, Judge Shu宜諭instructed that the defendant's subpoena had not been delivered and would be resubpoenaed on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>Last year, he formed an indissoluble bond with Gu Yizhen, a woman from the countryside of Wuxi. Gu is only eighteen years old and unmarried. Her elder sister, Sai Zhen, lives in Jiumudi in the city. Since Gu started living with Yizhen, he initially agreed to marry her as his wife, so Yizhen's mother, Bao, and Sai Zhen both agreed. Bao always addressed Gu as "son-in-law" in her letters to Gu and regarded herself as the mother-in-law. The letters were mostly forwarded through Sai Zhen's place to avoid mistakes. Unexpectedly, Gu Wenzhong has recently become ungrateful and treats Yizhen as a stranger. Her mother, Gu Bao, in the name of her daughter's legal guardian, hired a lawyer to sue Gu Wenzhong for interfering with the family in the First Special District Court, requesting legal punishment. Judge Wu Tingqi has held court hearings several times. Since Gu Bao has already recognized Gu Wenzhong as her son-in-law, he advised both parties to reconcile out of court, and there is no need to abandon friendship and promote hatred. However, although both parties appreciated the judge's intention to settle the matter, they were still unwilling to negotiate openly and reconcile. Half a month has passed and it has not yet been resolved. Yesterday afternoon, the court hearing was held again. The defendant Gu Wenzhong did not attend, but the plaintiff Gu Yizhen attended with her lawyer, requesting another extension so that they could continue to negotiate. Judge Wu granted the request and postponed the retrial to 1:25 pm next month. If a settlement has been reached before the next court hearing, they should submit a written request to withdraw the complaint.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Zhabei Soup Kitchen Hosts Press Visit <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei Liuying Road soup kitchen hosted members of the city's press corps for a visit yesterday morning. Around 8:00 AM, over ten reporters from various newspapers gathered at the Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road, had a quick breakfast, and set off. They arrived at the kitchen on Liuying Road around 9:00 AM. Subsequently, they were led on a tour by Wang Bin-yan and others. The tour concluded around 10:00 AM, and the kitchen provided transportation back. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Over 20,000 People Await Food　When the reporters arrived at Liuying Road, the soup distribution had just finished. A crowd of impoverished people, men, women, old, and young, in tattered clothes, carrying ladles and basins, poured out from the soup kitchen. In this beautiful city, who would have expected so many refugees, desperately waiting for food, numbering over 20,000. Their faces were filled with sorrow, a truly unbearable sight. The reporters then disembarked and were greeted by Mr. Wang Bin-yan and others, who led them inside for a tour.</p>
<p>Copper Coins Given to Those Who Didn't Get Soup　Inside were three temporary sheds, made of coarse bamboo with dense grids, intended as resting places. One was for men, one for women, and one for children, to prevent crowding during distribution and to protect women and children from being squeezed. Each shed had its own entrance for separate exits in batches. Security guards were stationed to maintain order. There were also five thatched huts, each with two stoves, and each stove had three pots, along with a total of seventeen large vats. Based on the soup distribution that morning, approximately 40 dan (a Chinese unit of dry volume, about 50 kg) of rice were cooked. Those who couldn't get soup were given copper coins, totaling 53 yuan. The cooking of the soup began at 11:00 PM, and the soup was stored in the vats, each vat able to serve 300 people. The doors were opened at 4:00 AM, and people went to the distribution room to receive soup. Adults received three ladles each, and children received two. After receiving the soup, they went to the temporary sheds. The doors were closed around 8:00 AM and opened again around 9:00 AM for people to leave in batches.</p>
<p>Wang Bin-yan Speaks of the Plight of the Poor　Mr. Wang also told the Central News Agency reporter that the number of poor people between Zhabei and Jiangwan who came here for food due to hunger and cold reached tens of thousands daily, of whom over 7,000 were men, and two-thirds were young and strong. These were mostly unemployed workers or laborers. Many factories in Zhabei were closing, and the commercial situation was even more dismal. Even rickshaw pulling could not guarantee a full meal. Furthermore, what is particularly noteworthy is that in previous years, those who came to the soup kitchen were mostly people from Jiangbei or Anhui, with very few locals. Now, there are many locals, even from as far as Jiangwan, who braved the elements and trekked long distances at 2:00 AM, hoping for a bowl of soup. Also, because of the large number of people, the soup kitchen had to distribute soup to everyone, but what one person received could not support the whole family. Therefore, the old, the young, and the sick had to be helped along the way. The people of Shanghai and various charitable organizations know about the disasters in other provinces and call for relief, but they do not observe the suffering of the lower classes in Shanghai, which is no less than that of the disaster victims in other provinces. This is regrettable. He hopes that the gentlemen of the press will publicize this in the newspapers so that all sectors can understand the truth and provide substantial assistance.</p>

<p>Previously, the Railway Bureau, noting the severe drought in various provinces last year, with widespread disaster victims, and concerned that they would have no clothes to keep warm in the cold season, decided to collect all the stored old uniforms from various offices to help with relief, based on the spirit of mutual assistance. Recently, the following items have been received: 696 winter uniforms, 452 pairs of trousers, 98 coats, 12 summer uniforms, and 34 pairs of trousers. On January 15th, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Relief Association for Drought Disasters in Various Provinces, requesting them to distribute these items on their behalf. Further shipments will be sent in batches as they are received.</p>

<p>"To President Guo:</p>
<p>Regarding the case reported in the newspapers on the 12th of this month, Ke Yinghao, relying on his Japanese nationality, behaved recklessly in your court, showing disrespect for superiors, and assaulting the opposing lawyer Zhu Sifu in court, which is outrageous. The dignity of the judiciary and the order of the court should be respected not only by Chinese citizens, but also by foreigners. Regardless of whether Ke Yinghao is of Japanese nationality, his arbitrary destruction of the order of the Chinese court is unacceptable to the legal profession. We hereby send this letter, hoping that your court will maintain the dignity of the court and restrain Ke Yinghao when he is summoned again. If he takes illegal action again, he should be corrected immediately. The rule of law is of utmost importance."</p>

<p>Yu Qiaqing Offers 500 Yuan in Compensation to the Deceased's Family</p>
<p>Fan, the Comprador, Generously Donates to Transport the Coffin Back to Tianjin</p>
<p>Regarding the incident on December 28th last year, in which a man from Tianjin named Huang Xiufeng was killed on the Sanbei Company's Jing'an Steamer when a cargo of corn collapsed in the cargo hold during a trip to Shanghai to visit his son, as reported in previous issues, it has been learned that Huang's wife, Huang Anshi, rushed here from Tianjin upon hearing the news, weeping loudly over the coffin. She expressed that after Huang's tragic death, she did not know who would be able to support their family of nine, and that the eldest son was still in school, the second son was young, and the four daughters were waiting to be married. In order to maintain their future livelihood, she and her eldest son, Guisheng, went to the Sanbei Company on Guangdong Road to meet with General Manager Yu Qiaqing to express their hardship and request compensation. Huang Guisheng also reported to the 8th Branch of the Second Special District Municipal Federation for assistance, which resolved to forward the matter to the Second Special District Municipal Federation. It was resolved to request Mr. Yu Qiaqing to provide generous compensation, and Director Wu Guowei was sent with a letter to meet with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who relayed the plight of the deceased's family. Mr. Yu Qiaqing was deeply sympathetic and approved a special compensation of 500 yuan. At the same time, Mr. Fan Menglin, the comprador of the Jing'an Steamer, also acted righteously, generously donating money to help the deceased's family transport Huang Xiufeng's coffin back to Tianjin, to avoid further burdening the family. Mother and son Huang Anshi were deeply grateful, and on the morning of the day, they filed a statement with the District Court Prosecutor's Office to collect the coffin and close the case. They then sealed the coffin for transport and went to the Sanbei Company to collect the compensation before returning to Tianjin that day.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Caohejing Guanshengyuan Farm has been painstakingly managed, and its scale is gradually taking shape. In addition to agricultural production, it is also dedicated to horticulture. Last autumn, it held a chrysanthemum and garden party, a small test of its capabilities, and the results were quite good. Now, as the plum blossoms are in full bloom, it is expanding the scale, collecting plum blossom bonsai and self-planted various plum blossom varieties from famous mountains, gathering them in one garden, and deciding to hold a Plum Blossom Festival for seven days starting from February 4th of the solar calendar. It is heard that the farm also plans to solicit famous plum blossoms and bonsai from public and private gardens to participate in the exhibition (the farm can also be rented out). Those interested are requested to come to Mr. Gu at the office on the third floor of the Guanshengyuan Company on Nanjing Road to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Petty Theft of Rice Causes a Disturbance <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Zhaoxing Steamer arrived at the British-owned Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong. At 11:00 AM, while the rice was being unloaded, a porter from Shandong named Ma Keli secretly stole some loose rice, hiding it around his waist, intending to leave the wharf. He was discovered by Li Buyue, a police officer stationed at the wharf, who went forward to search him. However, Ma immediately dumped the stolen rice into the Huangpu River, so that no stolen goods were found. Feeling justified, he argued with Officer Li. The officer then blew his whistle, and officers from nearby posts came to assist in detaining Ma for questioning. After a while, another porter, Zhang Xueyin, gathered dozens of fellow workers and crowded at the entrance of the station, demanding Ma's release. The workers were all carrying carrying poles, iron hooks, and other items. Unable to achieve their demands, they took the opportunity to smash the windows of the station and injured Officer Li Buyue's left hand and left face. Another officer, Kong Xiangxi, also had the back of his left hand injured and bleeding. They also tore the pocket of his uniform. Zhang Baiyi, the comprador of the wharf, was informed of the incident and immediately telephoned the Pudong Public Security Branch Bureau. Director Zhang of the branch bureau ordered Police Chief Guo Yongliang to rush to the scene to suppress the situation. Fortunately, no major incident occurred. The troublemaking workers, Ma Chongli and Zhang Xueyin, as well as the foreman Wei Rixin, were taken to the bureau for questioning, and the two injured officers were sent to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. At this time, the Shandong workers stopped working to show their support. The branch bureau sent police for the second time to suppress the situation, and the workers continued to work. Afterwards, the branch bureau director sent the three arrested persons to the headquarters for further action. In the afternoon, the wharf comprador sent a letter to the branch bureau, detailing that the workers had been in dispute over wages for adding two or three floors to the warehouse, and this time they used this as a pretext to cause trouble. He requested continued police protection to avoid a strike.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, around 3:00 PM, six or seven workers were climbing on the roof, dismantling the roof tiles, when the roof beam, which had been charred by the fire, could not bear the weight and broke. All the workers fell down. Fortunately, the height was not high, and they only suffered minor injuries. An ambulance was called and they were sent to the Second Hospital of the Red Cross for treatment.</p>

The tenth term started this Tuesday (details have been reported in this newspaper). Recently, at the invitation of the Western YMCA, the association attended a debate at 9:00 PM on the 17th. The topic was "English Can Be Used as an International Language." First, a member of the YMCA, Hua Erfu, came out to defend the proposition, followed by Zhao Juecheng, representing the Esperanto side, to refute. After half an hour of debate, the attendees expressed their opinions. In the end, the Esperanto side won with 14 to 12 votes.

Those with questions can go to the association at Yongping Fang, Carter Road, to discuss in person.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Two New Rubbings Released by the Medical Bookstore <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>"Rubbing of Lv Yaoxian's Xiao Jian Si Zhu Coin," one volume. This is a rubbing of the Xiao Jian Si Zhu coin, presented by Minister Lv Yaoxian to Mr. Chen Shouqing. There are as many as 54 types. Bao Zinian's "Explanation of Coins" says, "Xiao Jian Si Zhu, one side has the leaf pattern, one side is small Seal Script." It is the most difficult to obtain. The saying among coin collectors is that one coin in the capital is worth 20,000 to 30,000 cash. At the end of the Daoguang reign, a pot suddenly appeared in the South, and Yaoxian obtained hundreds of them, which he distributed. Not only are the sizes different, but some are upside down, some read left to right, and some have one character upright and one character upside down. Some are placed horizontally on the top and bottom of the square hole, some are facing left and right, some are upside down, some have rubbed shapes, and there are four stars, four circles, and four broken patterns. The Xiao Jian coin has the difference of both sides being the same text or being inverted or horizontally placed, and rubbed shapes. The Si Zhu coin also has both sides being the same text, and the characters also written above and below the square hole. All kinds of peculiarities, up to 54 kinds. Although it is as small as an elm pod, the bluish-green color penetrates to the bone and is absolutely precious to play with. Coins become more and more peculiar, and are fully prepared by our dynasty. It is believed that the land does not hide treasures." Now, comparing this rubbing with Bao's description, everything is in agreement. It is truly a grand sight of Xiao Jian Si Zhu coins. Now it is printed with a glass plate, and it is no different from the real rubbing. The actual price is one yuan per volume.</p>

<p>The fruit row clerks, in view of the oppression they have suffered from the owners in recent years, using their sweat and blood to earn meager wages like oxen and horses, repeatedly being deducted by the owners, and for the purpose of increasing the knowledge and skills of the clerks and improving their lives, felt the necessity to organize a group. Therefore, dozens of clerks initiated and jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department to organize the Shanghai Fruit Industry Trade Union. The organization was approved, and Rong Baokang, Hong Dexing, Shen Baokun, Xu Binggui, Bao Liren, Chu Songhai, Weng Wuquan, Jiang Wenquan, Zheng Wensong, and other nine people were appointed as preparatory members. At the beginning of the registration, Cai Runshan, chairman of the Fruit and Ground Cargo Industry Association, repeatedly ordered the clerks to sign, provide willingness statements and surety bonds, citing violations of Articles 31 and 32 of the Trade Union Law, in order to disrupt the organization, almost leading to a major dispute. After mediation, in order to resolve the matter peacefully, the labor side complied with the mediator's intentions and changed the name of the Shanghai Fruit Industry Trade Union to the Shanghai Fruit Industry Clerks' Fellowship Association. The change was approved by the Municipal Party Department. The clerks held a meeting to discuss and decided to continue to entrust Rong Baokang and the other nine people to be responsible for the preparations. It is heard that the association will soon complete the preparations and set a date to hold a general meeting to elect directors and supervisors, to see its success.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Peng Xiangying Lectures on the Relationship Between Citizens and Air Defense (Continued) <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>However, when we should make efforts, all the sand and fire extinguishers used to extinguish fires caused by incendiary bombs, as well as buckets and other items used for fire prevention, we must fully prepare them in peacetime, and within the possible range, we must also purchase gas masks, so that when enemy planes drop incendiary bombs and gas bombs at the same time during wartime, we can engage in firefighting work.</p>
<p>However, in wartime, if an incendiary bomb falls, it must be immediately covered with sand to extinguish it and prevent it from spreading. If it has spread and affected other objects, fire extinguishers or buckets of water should be used to extinguish it. Even residents in neighboring lanes must immediately gather and work together to rescue. In addition, government offices, schools, factories, and major companies should always have fire-fighting equipment, and organize employees, workers, and students into fire brigades for pre-training. Then, with wartime preparations, if peacetime disasters occur, the benefits of fire-fighting can be obtained.</p>
<p>The above is specifically about the importance of the responsibilities borne by citizens in terms of fire prevention. During air raids, all duties such as poison prevention, rescue, construction, security, traffic management, and alarm transmission also require citizens to take the lead, because these are the tasks most closely related to citizens. If citizens do not take the initiative to take on these tasks, even if the government leads, it will not be easy to achieve thorough and widespread results. Therefore, the relationship between citizens and air defense is indeed extremely close, and the task of air defense is indeed entirely up to the citizens.</p>
<p>Recently, our government authorities, feeling the frequent national crises and the pressing dangers, and the ambition of strong neighbors still growing, in case of an emergency, our important cities will inevitably be raided and turned to ashes in an instant. Therefore, in November of last year, the first air defense exercise was held in the capital, which can be said to be a guide in the national air defense facilities. Because this air defense exercise not only gave the citizens of Nanjing a very deep understanding of air defense, but also made the people across the country feel the need for air defense. If we already have a considerable understanding of air defense and know that it is an urgent and serious problem, we should actively study it and strive to implement it. Although our country lacks financial resources and lags behind in everything, the necessary national defense construction cannot be done all at once, but as long as all our comrades can embrace the determination to work hard, it will not be difficult to catch up and keep pace with the great powers.

<p>A Petty Official in a Remote Place Comes with a Strong Order</p>
<p>In a Magnificent Hall, There Are Pitiful Insects Outside</p>
<p>On Cheng Zhiqian's side, he knew very well that Zhang and Li were both vulgar official insects, but since they were greeting him politely, he was too embarrassed to ignore them. So when Zhang Jiefu came with that flattering attitude, he had no choice but to greet him with a smile and ask him to sit down. However, he had his own way of doing things, so he reached into his arms and groped for a while. He took out a small blue cloth package, opened it, and inside was a white silk handkerchief. Opening the white silk handkerchief, there was a red paper tray, holding two pieces of jade ware. One was a finger ring with a half-circle edge, and the other was a finely carved small jade horse. Cheng Zhiqian was a little surprised. Could it be that he was also in the jade business and came to solicit business? Zhang Jiefu smiled and held the red paper tray with both hands. He handed it to Cheng Zhiqian and said, "This little thing is just a token of my respect." Cheng Zhiqian was even more stunned. They had no friendship with each other. Why would he send such valuable gifts? How could he dare to accept them? He shook his hands repeatedly and said, "I dare not, I dare not. How can I receive such a great favor?" Zhang Jiefu placed the jade on the table, cupped his hands and said, "I also know that Mr. Cheng is unwilling to give me face. But if I explain, Mr. Cheng can accept it. I have a fellow villager in the city of Xi'an who is in the antique business. I went to see him today, and he casually gave me these two things. The things he gave me were not without meaning. He thought that I knew many people in the political world and that someone would come to Xi'an to buy antiques. He asked me to introduce one or two. I think it would be a waste if he gave these things to me. Moreover, they are worth thirty or forty yuan. It is really inconvenient for me to use. Mr. Cheng is a person with wide contacts. It is said that a precious sword is given to a hero, so I will give it to Mr. Cheng." (Eleven</p>

<p>After reading Mr. Jiangniao's "Four Strange Faces," which said that famous people in Shanghai all have strange faces, I was reminded of the faces of the great men of the Party and the country. Here are a few examples: (1) The face of a scholar-official: Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, is known to all as a revolutionary pioneer and a great contemporary politician. Now in his fifties, he looks like a Confucian scholar, only about forty years old:</p>
<h3 id="e212">Spring and Autumn Anecdotes <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Xi Shi is a typical beauty in Chinese history. Her hometown is Zhuji's Luoluo Village in Zhejiang. It is said that a supremely beautiful woman is still born in that village every year, but she is always unfortunate and dies young.</p>
<p>Zheng Banqiao said: "We scholars, holding a book, want to become officials, how to seize money, build big houses, and acquire more property; from the beginning, we went the wrong way, and later it became worse and worse, and there was no good result." But how many scholars in the world do not follow this path? (Banana Heart)</p>
<p>This is the same as Mr. Hu Hanmin. They are both gentle white-faced scholars. Where can you see that they are great revolutionary men? History says that Zhang Zifang looked like a woman. You know it's not a mistake.</p>
<p>(2) The face of a bodhisattva: Mr. Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, used to read his essays in the Tianduo Bao and Minquan Bao. They were sharp and sharp, and I imagined what kind of person he was. Since converting to Buddhism, he has been solemn and compassionate, overflowing with eyebrows, really like the "wonderful appearance of the Tathagata" of Mr. Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, and Di Pingzi in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) The face of an immortal: Mr. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, is tall and extraordinary. He is proficient in Tai Chi. He looks like one of the Eight Immortals. This may be because learning changes temperament and appearance.</p>
<p>(4) The face of an old woman: Mr. Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Committee who calls himself the old woman Liu in the Daguan enclosure, is old and has a pursed mouth, which is a bit like the "face of an old woman." However, although Mr. Wu's mouth is pursed, his tongue is like a lotus flower. When he opens his mouth, he is extremely humorous and profound. He is truly worthy of being the old woman Liu.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Decline of Handicrafts (Chen Liang) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>From the mouths of several fellow villagers who are craftsmen, I learned about the recent decline of handicrafts. Although they are still lucky enough not to be unemployed, they can only make a living, and their lives are extremely difficult. Their short shirts and pants are worn into the color of soy sauce. They don't even have money to get a haircut or take a bath. Now I will write down the words of a few people below, which is also a serious social problem.</p>
<p>A tailor said: "People think that clothes can't always be saved. It's true, but in this year, the market is not good, and money is not easy to earn. Ordinary people's daily expenses are all tightening their belts. For example, old styles are turned over, big ones are changed to small ones, and leather ones are replaced with a new face. It's over. New clothes can be saved if they can be saved. In this way, we tailors have no future. The table is deserted, and the tailors are frowning and playing five passes. Do you think it's still doing well?"</p>
<p>A book cover maker said: "Friends who read books know that now all books have been changed to hardcover and Western-style books. Some time ago, there were still some thread-bound books that used book covers. Now, they have been affected by the competition and dumping of bookstores, and many ancient books and old novels have been reprinted as single books, with Western paper covers. They think that book covers are outdated and superfluous. The people who make book covers have also been deprived of their jobs."</p>
<p>[P Street fragrance floats princess original thin drive translation</p>
<p>This is another section of extremely hard-won professional knowledge. All the countless lines of sight are focused on that Semar, which has been covered in dust for a long time and has only been hastily cleaned today, and the Empress Dowager is particularly complacent.</p>
<p>Comparing this hard and brave life of the former people with the life in the palace now, I really don’t know how much difference there is! It almost makes us unable to believe that the former rulers of Manchuria could really endure such hardship and struggle! In fact, some are not fake! Not only the leader, but all the royal relatives, ministers and attendants in the palace can be said to be tempered and polished in this kind of life every day: at this moment, hundreds of years of luxurious Chinese life have completely softened us.</p>
<p>At that time, we had visited all the three small palaces. Then, under the leadership of the Empress Dowager, we walked to the square outside. In the past, almost every day someone used his courage and strength to fight with those beasts with sharp claws on this square. Now, it has become a useless wasteland, but the forest on the west side of the field is more lush and lush. The tall shadows of the trees are shaking on the ground, almost making us suspect that some wild beasts will rush out of it. The Empress Dowager raised her head and looked around casually, as if she sighed with great emotion.</p>
<p>Before we decided to come here, the Empress Dowager had said something about the approximate history of this day's commemoration in the Shengjing Palace, and also allowed us to tell us the details after seeing a forest here: Now. We have already arrived in front of this forest, so her appointment has also been fulfilled! (Two hundred and twenty-six)</p>
<p>A mahogany maker said: "We rely on our strength to make a living. As long as we can pull a saw for a day, we don't have to worry about being hungry. However, the current generation is all about Western style. They use Western-style woodenware. The wealthier ones don't even use anything from the toilet to the chrome bed. Moreover, small pieces are not available in Western stores. Now that we have strength but no work, is it our dead end?"</p>
<p>There are also grinding, copper making ...... I can't write much. In short, some people in the city who have the ability to buy are worshipping Europe. All daily necessities are imported, even the toilet paper used in the toilet is not made in China. As for the inland, all the clothing and utensils that were originally available have to be sent to the pawnshop to pawn money. What purchasing power can we talk about? The result of the above is that China's national industry is declining, and the handicraft industry is collapsing behind the machine-made industry.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Taste (Yan Xunlou) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Food has various tastes, and the ability to distinguish these tastes depends entirely on the mouth.</p>
<p>The mouth can taste what is sweet, what is salty, what is sour, what is bitter, and what is spicy.</p>
<p>People's tastes also vary. Generally speaking, the largest number of people like to eat sweet things, followed by those who like to eat salty things, and then those who like to eat sour and spicy things. As for those who like to eat bitter things, it can be said that there are very few.</p>
<p>My second brother loves to eat sour things. Every time he eats noodles, he always complains that the soup is too salty. Once, the family deliberately put only vinegar in his noodle soup. After he finished eating, they asked him how the soup tasted. He said, "The soup tastes very good today, but it's a little less salty." In fact, he didn't know that there was no salt in the soup at all! This is also a joke about taste.</p>
<p>A cook who wants to please his master seems to have to know his master's taste first, but this cannot be considered a good cook. A really good cook is able to cook delicious dishes that everyone who eats can accommodate and adapt to his taste.</p>
<p>Therefore, we ask that all cooks be able to cook standard and compelling delicacies: at the same time, we also hope that all people who eat have standard and tasteful tongues.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Night Visit to Tianning Temple (Fire and Snow Bright) <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The flourishing of Chinese Buddhism has a long history, and there are many ancient monasteries and temples throughout the land that have long been famous. Just taking Tianning Temple as an example, there are already four locations: one outside Xihuan, Beiping; one outside Tianning Gate in Jiangdu; one outside the West Gate of Haikang County in Guangdong; but the one I am talking about is that one built during the Tang Dynasty outside the East Gate of Changzhou City.</p>
<p>Traveling to Changzhou, it was an overcast day in early winter without snow. Walking into the train station, looking at the distant city center, it was already dotted with bright lights. The night wind was blowing very strongly. I hailed a rickshaw and went into the city alone, planning to drink my fill of Lanlu famous wine and devour some thin-skinned, fresh pork, because it was my first visit and I let the rickshaw pull me wherever it went. I could say I was completely ignorant of the names of the streets we passed. However, judging from the city's appearance, where commerce wasn't very developed at night, it was still similar to Guicheng in Yixing.</p>
<p>The rickshaw was stopped at Xiaofu Bridge. Fortunately, the lights were burning brightly in the night market. Turning towards the west side of the bridge, I glimpsed Deshun Restaurant on Xianzhi Street. I was feeling quite hungry, so I went upstairs to "repair my five internal organs." Needless to say, the taste of the wine didn't compare to Dongpu Xingruan Society of Shaoxing. Li Taibai's "Lanling fine wine, amber-colored fragrant" was just an occasional expression of exuberance. However, the Dongpo fatty pork was no less delicious than that of Huangzhou, Hubei. I especially loved the sugar-soaked celery, which was excellent in both color and flavor!</p>
<p>After eating and drinking to my fill, I thought that my friend who was ailing was staying at Tianning Temple. Instead of spending money in a noisy inn to spend this long, lonely winter night, it would be better to go to the ancient temple to talk to him. Moreover, I could also take the opportunity to inquire about his recent health, so I called the temple and asked them not to close the mountain gate too early.</p>
<p>I got back on the streetcar, and in the moonlight, as cool as water, I looked at the calm streets and alleys, and the changing stars, feeling a sense of loneliness on my journey. Thanks to the rickshaw puller's strength, he pulled me towards Dongzhi Street. I heard the sound of the watchman's gong on the city wall, slowly becoming lighter and farther away.</p>
<p>Round and round, I don't know how far we traveled. Because of fatigue, I just closed my eyes and let my thoughts wander. Although the cold wind easily awakens a light intoxication, I immersed myself in even deeper reverie, even vaguely forgetting to look at the buildings in the night.</p>
<p>It was when the rickshaw came out of the East Gate that, in the dim light of the oil lamps, I vaguely recognized three or five refugee beggars, squatting on straw and dozing off. So I completed a five-character poem: "Poor and drunk seek a haven, lonely footsteps happen to visit Zen. Frosty clothes draped over the noon moon, catkins press against my prime! On the road, I hear hungry birds, in the mansions, the sounds of music. It is our generation's concern to grieve for the times, but there is no way to ask the deaf heavens." I planned to recite it to my ailing friend after a while, to see how he would critique it.</p>
<p>Almost at the end of Dongzhi Street, the rickshaw puller suddenly asked, his voice sounding rushed,</p>
<p>"Sir, should I pull straight into Tianning Temple?"</p>
<p>This interrupted my contemplation of the poem.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, I saw a gray battlement on the left, with a curved doorway in the center. The moonlight was pouring into the square inside the gate, where tall trees provided shade and appeared to be sleeping in clusters. As I pointed towards the mountain gate to the rickshaw puller, the rickshaw quickly rolled inside.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was because of the sound of the rickshaw bell, or the accidental night cry of a roosting bird, but it startled a sleeping yellow dog, which jumped up and barked furiously. In the quiet night, it was easy to disturb the gate-keeping monk.</p>
<p>At this time, a frozen cloud was flying across the sky, temporarily obscuring the moon. In the empty courtyard, there was only a deep darkness, and the leaves were singing in the wind. Along with the dog's barking, the scene was truly touching. Looking towards the mountain gate ahead, a small red light was faintly visible, seeming to be moving, moving very quickly, like a lighthouse in the night sea. But the light moved closer and closer, and bigger and bigger. Gradually, I could see the face of the person holding the lantern. Wasn't it a monk wearing a tall hat? I immediately jumped off the rickshaw, paid the fare, and hurried towards the red light by the tree, gratefully saying:</p>
<p>"Master, I'm so sorry to trouble you! You've been waiting a long time."</p>
<p>"It's alright! Are you coming from the city, sir?" The monk stood still and asked me in return. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e216">Ten Questions and Ten Answers <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>(1) Doctor Zhao asks: I have been practicing medicine for many years, but I have not found any perfect medical books to reference, which is a great regret. You have lived in Shanghai for a long time and must have seen and heard a lot. Can you tell me something? Answer: The Guangxie Bookstore at No. 140 Beijing Road, Shanghai (corner of Route Pottier) sells books of this type from the Chinese Medical Association (formerly the Bo Medical Association) and the Chinese Nurses Association. There should be everything you need. You may wish to write for a catalog to read. (2) Principal Li asks: Our school has many students and plans to implement the New Life Movement, focusing on hygiene. Where can we purchase hygiene books? Answer: The Guangxue Bookstore in Shanghai sells all hygiene books, charts, models, and lantern slides from the Chinese Hygiene Education Association, the Ministry of Interior's Department of Health, and major bookstores. The styles are complete and purchasing is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>(3) Ms. Huang Lizhu asks: There are more than a dozen infants and young children in my home, who often get sick, causing both mental and financial losses. Is there any wonderful way to remedy this? I hope you can advise me! Answer: Infants get sick mostly because parents do not know how to prevent them, and after they get sick, they do not know how to take good care of them. If you have books such as the Childcare Guide (one yuan), Haohou and Ershi's Infant and Pediatric Medicine, Volumes I and II (nine yuan), Hao Ci's Pediatric Q&amp;A (two jiao), Infant Nursing Methods (four jiao), or Healthy Living (five yuan), they can be of great help. The above books are sold by Guangxue Bookstore. (4) Colonel Zhang Mingda asks: Mingda has served in the Army Hospital for three years and now plans to study surgery and anatomy. Are there any perfect Chinese texts? Answer: Guangxie Bookstore has a large number of medical books of this kind. You can write a letter to ask for a catalog.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Wang Boqin asks: I have been studying at a medical school late in life, and I see that there are no standard translations of medical terms, which causes some difficulties when studying and translating. Is there a bookstore in Shanghai that sells standard medical dictionaries? Answer: The standard medical terminology dictionaries reviewed and approved by the Scientific Terminology Review Committee include Medical Terminology Compilation, eight yuan; English-Chinese Medical Vocabulary, four yuan; Chinese-English Medical Dictionary, two and a half yuan; Chinese Pharmacopoeia, six yuan. All are sold at Guangxie Bookstore, No. 140 Beijiu Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>(6) Professor Di Zilin asks: I have long known that Guangxie Bookstore is the general agency for Chinese medical and health books. However, I like to read original foreign books. I don't know if there is a bookstore in Shanghai that sells them? Answer: The Oxford University Press and the Columbia University Press in New York publish a wealth of medical books. Guangxie Bookstore is the Chinese manager of these two companies. The bookstore also sells medical books from other major British and American bookstores.</p>
<p>(7) Miss Xue Huifen asks: After class, I often like to sing poems and play the piano to entertain myself. Now I plan to add more sheet music and songbooks to increase my enjoyment. I would appreciate it if you could introduce some good books! Answer: The sheet music used by famous girls' schools such as Shanghai Zhongxi Girls' School and St. Mary's are mostly purchased from Guangxie Bookstore. Therefore, the young lady can also purchase from the bookstore.</p>
<p>(8) Pastor Chen asks: The church members in my area are eager to read various Christian publications in order to understand the truth and preach the gospel. However, there are many publishing agencies, and it often takes a lot of time to purchase a book by mail, asking questions repeatedly, and the result is still nothing. Is there a simple and effective way to purchase by mail? Answer: There are about a hundred Christian publishing agencies, large and small. Shanghai Guangxie Bookstore has spared no effort to collect more than ten thousand kinds of new and old books published by them and compiled an index (Chinese-English combined, one yuan; Chinese version, two jiao). With this book, the book title can be established and purchased from Guangxie Bookstore, which is extremely convenient. (9) Mr. Ge Shangjie asks: I have some experience in English and find that reading the original English version is more pure and natural. However, it is quite inconvenient to order from abroad every time. Is there a bookstore in Shanghai that manages British publications? Answer: The publications of Oxford University Press are world-famous, and the publications of more than ten other companies such as Columbia University Press are all managed by Guangxie Bookstore. In addition to literature, it also sells specialized scientific books.</p>
<p>(10) Dr. Zhang Chengdao asks: Is the name of the central agency in our country that sells medical and health books Guangxue Bookstore or Guangxie Bookstore? Answer: It was originally named Guangxue Bookstore. Later, because the name was easily confused with Guangxuehui, the Guangxie Bookstore is still located at No. 140 Beijing Road, Shanghai (corner of the Museum Road). Also, because the bureau took over the Xiehe Bookstore, it was renamed.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Western Academy of Sciences Collects Specimens, Yu Jichuan Talks About the Discovery of New Plants in Xikang <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Ruide Wood and Gongtong Discovered on High Mountains</p>
<p>Liangshan Yi Nationality Kidnaps Han People as Slaves</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) Yu Jichuan, chairman of the Botany Department of the Western Academy of Sciences, arrived in Peiping from Sichuan today, carrying more than twenty boxes of plant specimens collected in Sichuan. He will borrow the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute to test and determine their functions and types. This afternoon, the reporter visited Yu. According to him, the Western Academy of Sciences was initiated by Lu Zuofu and others, and was established in Baxian, Sichuan in 1931. The main tasks are investigation, research, experimentation, and improvement of Western products. There are currently biological, physical and chemical, geological, and agricultural and forestry research institutes. The biological and geological research institutes focus on investigation. In addition to private fundraising, the China Culture and Education Foundation Committee also provides some subsidies. The responsibility I (Yu himself) undertake is the botany department, so I can only tell you about the situation of the botany department. The main task of the botany department is to investigate wood, medicinal materials, oil materials, and other main tasks. Sichuan has the most of these items, so it is divided into early areas, and it is planned to complete the three investigations. The general purpose since 1932 is to (1) solve the types of plants, (2) the economic value of plant species. Although the scheduled period has expired, there are still some that have not been completed, so supplementary work is still being done. Later, because Xikang is adjacent to Sichuan Province and there are few people who go there for health surveys, people have recently been sent to collect plant specimens. The province is divided into four regions, which are expected to be completed within two years. There may be new discoveries in the future to contribute to the academic community. As for the plants collected in Sichuan Province, more than ten new species have been discovered and announced. The most recently discovered new species include Ruide Wood, Gongtong, and Rhododendron (Azalea). The first two must be found on high mountains of two or three kilometers or more. What are their functions? Still under study. In mid-August and September last year, the botany department sent personnel to the mountains southwest of Sichuan to collect specimens. The area is located between Sichuan Leibo, Mabian, Ebian, Pingshan, Xichang, and Huili, which are occupied by the Yi nationality. They are very harmful to the exclusion of the Han people. Only small merchants go there at ordinary times, so the people of Sichuan are all regarded as secret dens. Before we went, we had the help of the highest local government and the gentry of the neighboring counties, and we bought off the responsible protection of the three branches of Moshimoqu Enxia (that is, the chiefs) with Sichuan salt and local cloth before we dared to go. We stayed there for two months and collected many specimens and discovered large forests, about a hundred miles long and about twenty miles wide, and drew maps of the deep mountains. However, we encountered many difficulties, and some lives were sacrificed along the way, so we could not complete the work. The local people occupied Zhaojue County in Sichuan Province, and often kidnap Han people as slaves and can buy and sell them at will. Therefore, the Han people who are now in the area account for 80 to 90 percent of the total population and are generally assimilated. If the Chinese people continue to be as indulgent as they used to be, the Yi nationality will harm Sichuan Province, and I am afraid it will be even worse than the Communist bandits, said (Jin).</p>

<h3 id="e220">Ministry of Education Compiles Chinese Education Yearbook <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>To Publicize to the International Community to Clarify the Truth of Education in Our Country</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved a letter from the International English Yearbook Agency, requesting that a summary of Chinese education be compiled in 200,000 words and translated into Western languages ​​in order to publicize to the international community. Because international organizations often do not understand the situation of Chinese education when editing the education yearbooks of various countries in the world, there is no systematic record of the whole thing. Therefore, China compiles a national education yearbook similar to the entire systematic education summary and sends it to the agency. After receiving the letter, the Ministry of Education has compiled the characteristics and summary of higher, secondary, primary, and social education at all levels throughout the country. It is being translated by members of the Ministry who are proficient in English. The English version will be completed soon and a letter will be sent to the agency for international promotion.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to explain the deadline for students who fail the joint entrance examination to repeat grades, instructed the Jiangsu Education Department, stating briefly that the deadline for repeating grades for the secondary school graduation joint entrance examination should be handled in accordance with Article 64 of the Secondary School Regulations. (Article 64 stipulates that students who fail more than three subjects in the graduation joint entrance examination or only two subjects fail, but the subjects are any two of the four subjects of Chinese, English, arithmetic, and work in junior high school, and any two of the five subjects of Chinese, English, arithmetic, physics, and chemistry in senior high school shall be required to repeat the grade for one year. However, this repetition is limited to one time. If they still cannot graduate, a certificate of completion will be issued and they will be required to withdraw from school.)</p>
<h3 id="e222">Many Schools in Beijing Have Winter Vacations <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The schools in Nanjing have completed the semester exams on Wednesday of this week. Elementary schools with sixth-grade graduates (such as Fuxi Street, etc.) held farewell ceremonies for teachers and students on the afternoon of the 17th and issued winter vacation self-study questions for students to take back for self-study. From the 18th, all municipal schools will be closed. Private secondary schools are relatively later. The two provincial experimental elementary schools established by Jiangsu Province in Beijing will also start their winter vacation on the 18th. However, because students in the provincial secondary school are limited by customs, judging from past facts, school starts too early after the winter vacation, and there are many staff and few students. It is heard that most secondary schools in Jiangsu Province have a later winter vacation than schools in Beijing. Therefore, the two provincial secondary schools in Beijing also have a later winter vacation, around next week.</p>
<p>[P Zhejiang Education Department Orders and Issues Production Achievement Competition Measures&gt;</p>
<p>The counties of Zhejiang Province have been carrying out production education since the Education Department promoted and supervised its implementation for several years. The production achievements of various places should be compared to learn from each other and promote improvement. It is learned that the Education Department has specially ordered and issued the Outline of the Measures for Holding Production Achievement Competitions in Various Counties and Cities in Zhejiang Province, which contains fourteen articles, in order to facilitate the implementation of this competition in various counties and cities.

The aforementioned outline has been ordered to be followed by the county and city governments.</p>

<p>Newly established high school semesters should receive military training</p>
<p>This city's colleges and universities above specialty schools should receive summer military training this year, which has been ordered by the Ministry of Education. The National Military Training Association of this city is currently preparing. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e224">Summer Training is Currently Being Prepared The Ministry of Education once <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Ordered all colleges and universities above specialty schools in this city, except for high school students who should receive centralized training this year, and are exempt from summer military training, all colleges and universities above specialty schools should still implement summer training according to the original plan. The National Military Training Association is now actively preparing. Regarding food and other expenses for summer training, it should be borne by the school.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Centralized Training Will Not Change High School Military Training Students <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Centralized training is scheduled to be held from April 10 to July 10 this year. There are rumors that there will be changes, which is absolutely untrue. The expenses will be borne by the government. All schools should prepare to participate and should not take a wait-and-see attitude. The students who should receive centralized military training are those who started in the spring or autumn of 1934. Students who started in the spring of this year will receive centralized training next year. Regarding the training location, it has been determined by the National Military Training Association. The equipment is very complete, but it is still difficult to announce temporarily. According to the reporter's speculation, the Longhua Airport may be more suitable.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Ten Professors to Hold First Cultural Construction Seminar Today <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Invite Reporters from Various Newspapers and Professors from Various Universities to Participate</p>
<p>Hoping That This Meeting Will Produce Concrete Solutions</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Writes to He Bingsong in Support of the Principles of the Declaration</p>
<p>The ten professors who recently published the Declaration on Chinese-Based Cultural Construction are now scheduled to hold the first Cultural Construction Seminar at the Central Society at 5:00 pm today to discuss various issues of cultural construction. Those who have been invited to participate include chief writers of various newspapers, presidents of various universities, and more than 30 well-known scholars. The record will be published in the fifth issue of the Cultural Construction Monthly. After publication, opinions from various scholars will be solicited. It is hoped that more concrete opinions will be produced so that this movement will not become an impractical movement. Also, He Bingsong, who signed the declaration, had previously sent the declaration to Cai Yuanpei. Cai now has a reply, acknowledging that the principles in the declaration are unbreakable principles and hoping that he can go further and strive to materialize the two principles of not being conservative and not blindly following. The original letter is specially published as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Bocheng's Da Jian, I have read the Declaration on Chinese-Based Cultural Construction that you sent me. In principle, in abstract theory, it can be said to be unbreakable. Confucius said, "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can serve as my teacher. I choose his virtues and follow them; his vices, I correct them." This is the attitude of not being conservative and not blindly following. The most important task now is to choose the good. What is good, what is universally recognized as good by mankind, without the distinction between Chinese and non-Chinese? What is considered good by the Chinese but not considered good by the non-Chinese? What is considered good by the non-Chinese but not considered good by the Chinese? List these objects separately, then compare and study them, which should be taken, which should be abandoned. Systematically compile the components that should be taken, and then a cultural construction plan can be made, and then the remaining characteristics of China can be pointed out. If there is no such plan and you discuss it out of thin air, it will inevitably be like Zhang Zhidong's slogan "Chinese Learning for the Fundamental Principles, Western Learning for Practical Application" and Liang Shuming's "Eastern and Western Cultures." Whether you agree or disagree, it is all empty talk. I respectfully present my humble opinion for your reference. Respectfully, Cai Yuanpei respectfully inscribed on January 18, 1935.</p>

<p>Amending the Cooperative Charter and Electing Supervisors</p>
<p>Distributing Profits and a Festive Dinner</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yu Tang Agricultural Production, Transportation, Marketing, Purchasing, Utilization, Credit, and Guarantee Cooperative was established in the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930] under the advocacy of Mr. Niu Yangsheng.  The former Agricultural and Mining Department of Jiangsu Province appointed Mr. Feng Zanyuan and Mr. Min Zhongji to be stationed in Yu Tang to design and guide its development. Since then, its foundation has become increasingly solid and its scale has broadened daily. Not only is it a model for various counties in Shanghai and Songjiang, but it has also been evaluated by the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province as number one among the 61 counties in the province. Recently, the cooperative added large-scale oil pressing equipment in its utilization department and implemented production cooperation, hoping to integrate various aspects of its business to accelerate the cooperative function, in order to assist in the improvement of rural affairs. The cooperative, in accordance with its charter, recently convened a members' congress. One hundred and fifty-six members attended, gathering at the Yu Tang People's Education Hall at 12 noon. After lunch, the meeting commenced. First, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Wang Chengyao, led the attendees in performing the rituals, followed by a report on the general situation of the cooperative's affairs over the past year. Subsequently, department heads such as Niu Zhiyi gave separate reports. Then, Niu Tisheng, representing Gu Jiaxuan, Niu Changyao, Chairman of the Yu Tang Cooperative Enterprise Guidance Committee, Feng Guohua, Director of the Provincial People's Education Hall Experimental Zone, and Feng Zanyuan, Director of the Livelihood Department, gave speeches. This was followed by a discussion of proposals: (1) to amend the cooperative charter to add articles for corporate members, (2) to approve 15 new members and recognize the Maqiao Cooperative and Qingdeng Cooperative as corporate members, (3) to elect Huang Meixian, Niu Changyao, Wang Aire and others as supervisors for this session. Then the distribution of profits took place, totaling more than 1,357 yuan. After deducting the public reserve fund, public welfare fund, reserve fund, and cooperative share interest according to the regulations, all the rest was distributed. After the meeting, a dinner was held. At 6 o'clock, the Yu Tang People's Education Hall, Yu Tang Elementary School, Qiangnu Horticultural School, and Yu Tang Drama Society performed entertainment, and the event ended with joy around 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Thirty-eight to Thirty-five, Another Victory Over the Jews</p>
<p>One Game in the Closing Ceremony Tonight, Group C</p>
<p>The Tax Bureau basketball team won this year's Xiqing Basketball Specialized Group B championship. Last night, in the second final against the Jews, the Tax Bureau won again with a score of 38 to 35. The Tax Bureau has won twice in a row, so the third final tonight will no longer be held. Tonight's schedule includes only one game at 6:45 PM, with Hujiang Affiliated High School vs. American Public in Group C. This year's Xiqing Men's Basketball will also close tonight. Last night's second game between the Tax Bureau and the Jews was still extremely tense. The Jewish forwards were exceptionally fierce, but unfortunately, their shooting was inaccurate; otherwise, the Tax Bureau would have lost. The Jewish defense, however, was like an open door. After tying twice at 15 and 17 in the first half, the Jews scored another two points, taking the lead 19 to 17. In the second half, the Tax Bureau calmly responded and was able to surpass them. However, at 27 to 26, the Jews scored another point, and at this time, the Jewish defender M. Gaberman was fouled out. The Tax Bureau scored four consecutive points and took the lead. The Jews eventually played the rest of the game with only four players.</p>

<p>Poland Triumphs in Football and Boxing</p>
<p>Germany Excelled in Athletics</p>
<p>(Warsaw Dispatch) In recent years, the German government has actively promoted sports to forge national fitness as the foundation of military-national education. Therefore, achievements in various ball sports and track and field events have been rapidly progressing. Poland, neighboring Germany, is also striving to develop national sports, establishing a central sports hall and training sports teachers. The two countries often have various sports and friendly competitions, visiting each other. Hundreds of thousands of spectators stimulate the excitement of the people of both countries for sports. Both sides have wins and losses. On December 20 last year, the Polish national champion Krakow football team led elite athletes to visit Germany and fought against the German national champion Berlin team in Berlin. The audience reached tens of thousands, and people from all over Europe traveled far to watch. The two teams fought hard. The German team was skilled in defense, but the activity of the forwards was slightly weaker. Poland was good at both offense and defense. In the first half, neither side scored. After changing sides, the Polish offensive became more urgent. Each team was able to fulfill its responsibilities and had excellent performances. As a result, Poland defeated Germany 1-0. That evening, the Berlin Sports Committee hosted a grand banquet to welcome all the Polish athletes. During the banquet, the two sides raised their glasses and shouted "Long live General Suski of Poland" and "Long live Chancellor Hitler of Germany," and the hosts and guests were very harmonious. The next morning, the German newspapers unanimously praised the Polish team.</p>
<p>To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the Polish Walter Sports Club specially invited the German Berlin Champion team and the Obalski Club to compete in boxing. The competition was held on December 25 in Poznan, Poland. As a result, the German team lost 2-14. The Polish boxing team is well-known in Europe and has repeatedly won the Central European Cup international boxing competition. It has defeated Hungary, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Most recently, it defeated East Prussia 11-5. In track and field, Germany is stronger than Poland with more evenly distributed talent. Both sides are actively training for the World Games to be held in Berlin next year, and will convene German athletes in Warsaw this fall to rigorously select the athletes to attend. The preparations are just beginning.</p>
<p>On December 25, the German-Polish ice hockey game was held at the best ice rink in Katowice, Poland. The Warsaw team represented Poland, while the Berlin Brandenburg Sports Club represented Germany. More than 10,000 people watched the game. The two teams battled in the cold wind and icy ground. The German team did not seem enthusiastic due to the long journey and ultimately lost 0-2. However, the German team's skill was still considerable.</p>

<h3 id="e244">The Withstand Voltage Problem of Filter Capacitors (Li Yuanqing) <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Recently, I and a friend repaired several AC radios of different styles. Some were purchased ready-made, and some were assembled by ourselves. However, the problems we found were exactly the same: the filter capacitor (Filter Condenser) short-circuited due to overload. Isn't this a very strange thing?</p>
<p>Commercially available radios, in order to strive for small size and low price, have to minimize the volume and quantity of each component. Therefore, it is natural that their filter capacitors are not durable. But why do self-made radios also have the same problem? That's a bit puzzling!</p>
<p>I guess that many people still don't have a good understanding of the withstand voltage problem of filter capacitors!</p>
<p>We know that all capacitors have a certain withstand voltage (Voltage rating), and exceeding this specified voltage is enough to affect its lifespan. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The withstand voltage marked on a capacitor usually represents the DC voltage, not the AC voltage. If you don't believe it, try connecting a capacitor marked with a withstand voltage of 500 volts to a 500-volt AC circuit, and there will likely be a short circuit soon!</p>
<p>To explain the above special phenomenon, we must first talk about the AC voltage itself.</p>
<p>The so-called AC voltage is not as simple as DC voltage. Strictly speaking, it is meaningless to just say "AC voltage." You must specify what kind of AC voltage it is.</p>
<p>The AC voltage itself is a sinusoidal waveform (Sine wave Form). (See attached picture) Its value changes constantly at any moment, and it is not constant. For the convenience of use, people divide it into the following three values:</p>
<p>(1) Effective AC Voltage: As mentioned above, AC voltage changes at any moment. In this way, isn't it difficult for us to get a definite value? In order to solve this difficulty, scientists first specified that the value of AC voltage that can produce the same function as DC voltage is called effective AC voltage (Effective Value of A. C. Voltage). The so-called AC voltage or the value measured in the AC voltage meter usually belongs to this type. Its value is approximately 0.707 times the maximum AC voltage.</p>
<p>(2) Maximum AC Voltage: The so-called maximum AC voltage (Maximum Value of A. C. Voltage) is the value of the AC voltage at its peak, so it is also called peak voltage (Peak Voltage). Its value is approximately 1.41 times the effective value.</p>
<p>(3) Average AC Voltage: The average AC voltage mentioned here (Average Value of A. C. Voltage) does not refer to the average value of the AC voltage in one cycle (Cycle) (the average value of one cycle is exactly zero), but refers to half a cycle (such as C to D and F to G in the figure). Its value is approximately 0.9 times the effective value.</p>
<p>The value measured in the AC voltage meter is the effective value, not the maximum value, as mentioned above. In fact, the maximum value can still be encountered twice in each cycle. Therefore, when using capacitors or any other components in AC circuits, we must be able to withstand the maximum value. In other words, it must be able to withstand at least 1.41 times the effective value to be applicable. From this point of view, it can be seen that connecting a 500-volt capacitor in an AC circuit means that the voltage it actually receives has a maximum of 500 * 1.41 = 705 volts, exceeding its specified withstand voltage by almost half, so how can there be no danger?</p>
<p>For example, if the output tube of a certain radio is 45, when the screen voltage is 275 volts, the C voltage is about 56 volts. Assuming that the voltage drop in the low-frequency choke coil is 40 volts, then the effective voltage received by the filter capacitor has reached 371 volts, and its maximum value is 375 x 1.41 = 523.11 volts. Under this condition, if a 500-volt capacitor is recklessly connected, it is expected that it will not be durable.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if the external voltage is too high, or the waveform is distorted (Wave Dislortion) due to the transformer heating up, its maximum value often exceeds 1.41 times the effective value. Therefore, in AC circuits, various insulation materials are usually used, and for safety reasons, the standard is that they can withstand 1.5 times the effective value. Therefore, the above-mentioned capacitor should use one that can withstand 371 x 1.5 = 556.15 volts. You can choose one that is closest to this number and can withstand 700 volts (Note: The withstand voltage marked on the capacitor is usually an advertising claim. In fact, it must be discounted by at least 80% to 90%. Therefore, choosing a 700-volt capacitor is not too much.</p>
<p>In addition, the withstand voltage of a capacitor will also be affected by heat. Therefore, the position where the capacitor is placed in the radio should be as far away as possible from the power transformer and other heating parts such as vacuum tubes. This also needs to be explained in passing.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Converting Powerful AC Radios to Headphones (Ming Xiang) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Since the popularity of powerful AC radios, headphones seem to have become relics of the past. Those who prepared them earlier now abandon them like waste. In fact, in many cases, we often feel the need for headphones. For example, when listening to music late at night, using a speaker to play music will inevitably disturb people's dreams. It is better to switch to headphones for quietness. Comrades who like to play with shortwave, if they use a speaker to receive music from distant radio stations, often get nothing because the signal is too weak. If they can switch to headphones, it is not difficult to get unexpected gains. If there are elderly people or people with hearing impairments at home, others may not be able to distinguish the appropriate volume when it is adjusted to the appropriate level. It is best to split a headphone so that they can also enjoy the music.</p>
<p>This article describes two of the simplest methods that can make headphones suitable for any radio. The first method is to add a wire to the screen of the last stage output tube of the radio: A is connected to the shell (Figure 1), and is connected to one end of a single-track headphone jack through a blocking capacitor C.</p>
<p>The other end is connected to the radio shell, as shown in Figure 1A. The jack can be installed on the side of the radio wooden box. If the output stage uses two vacuum tubes connected in push-pull mode, the two ends of the jack must each be connected to the screens of the two vacuum tubes through a blocking capacitor, as shown in Figure 1B.</p>
<p>When using, just insert the headphone plug into the jack to listen. As for the adjustment procedures of the radio, they are still the same as usual. If you want to receive distant radio stations, you only need the headphones to make sound. You can add a switch to the speaker voice coil wiring to turn it off. If you add headphones specifically for people with hearing impairments, you can turn on the switch and the speaker will play sound at the same time.</p>
<p>The volume adjustment of the first method must be adjusted on the original volume controller of the radio. The volume in the headphones cannot be adjusted separately, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, there is a second method to remedy this, that is, the headphones are not directly inserted into the radio's jack, but are replaced by a volume controller, as shown in Figure 2. The ab ends can receive the jack on the radio, and the headphones are inserted into J2 to adjust R, so that the volume in the headphones is suitable for their personal needs.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Amplifying Frequency Range Difference KMK <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Whether it is a radio or an amplifier, if you want it to have sufficient volume output, you must have considerable amplification equipment. Ordinary amplification is divided into high-frequency amplification (Radio Frequency Amplifier), intermediate frequency amplification (Intermediate Frequency)</p>
<p>Ampjilier) and low-frequency amplification (Audio Frequency Amplifier) and other three types of high-frequency amplification are to amplify the high-frequency radio waves emitted by the broadcasting station. After being amplified by the tube, the output is still high-frequency radio waves. The principle is nothing more than strengthening external radio signals to make the detection stage easier to receive.</p>
<p>Intermediate frequency amplifiers are mostly used in heterodyne or super-heterodyne radios. The so-called intermediate frequency is already the result of a considerable amount of detection. This detection is called the first-stage detection. Although the high-frequency radio waves have been detected, the signals received by the human ear cannot be heard. Therefore, intermediate frequency amplification is added here. It is also adjusted between the mutual inductance of the two coils, and then becomes an audio low frequency through the second-stage detection. Because there are many adjustment parts in this method, the selectivity is excellent.</p>
<p>Low-frequency amplification is to amplify the detected audio low-frequency radio waves. The amplification effect of this method is greater than the previous two methods, but the selectivity is of course inferior to the previous method because the adjustment part cannot be added. If multi-stage low-frequency amplification is added, the tone will inevitably be distorted. Therefore, in imported radios, low-frequency amplification is at most only one stage.</p>
<h3 id="e247">The Latest Tone Control Method (Li Yuanqing) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The usual method of controlling the tone is probably to connect a fixed capacitor and a variable resistor in parallel in the low-frequency amplification circuit (primary or secondary). When used, reducing the resistance can cut off the higher-frequency tones (Cut). As a result, the sound emitted from the speaker becomes very dull. (Please refer to my previous work "Tone Control Method" in issue 16 of this publication)</p>
<p>"Tone Control," as the name implies, should be able to control the high and low tones at will. However, the above-mentioned tone controller can only delete the high frequencies and fully release the low frequencies, but cannot reduce the low frequencies and emit high frequencies as much as possible. This is its shortcoming!</p>
<p>Western music has a high-pitched tone and many instruments. Whenever twenty or thirty people play together, the sound is loud and there is a lot of noise. Therefore, the high-frequency sound waves must be deleted before it can be pleasing to the ear. Chinese music is not like this. For example, a Dan role sings opera with a Jinghu. It is already monotonous. If you add the above-mentioned tone controller, then the listener will think that the person is playing a broken Huqin and singing with a nasal voice. This is the difference between the organization of Chinese and Western music and the hearing of Chinese and Western people. It cannot be forcibly combined.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a new type of tone controller in the British Amateur Wireless magazine, which can remedy the above-mentioned shortcomings. I have translated it succinctly for the reference of enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, L is a 3 to 4 bv choke coil, C is a 0.1 mf fixed capacitor, and R is a 10,000-ohm potentiometer (all connected in parallel in the primary coil of the low-frequency transformer, as shown in the dotted line in the attached figure). When the potentiometer R stops at the center point, this device has little effect. At this time, the tone released from the speaker is moderately high and low. When R is turned to the right, the higher-frequency tones all slip away from C, and the sound emitted is very dull. When R is turned to the left, the lower-frequency tones all escape from L, and the sound emitted can be very lively.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Another Method to Increase Selectivity KMK <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>In Shanghai, where there are many radio stations, the issue of selectivity is indeed difficult to solve. Except for multi-stage high-frequency adjustment and super-heterodyne radios with better selectivity, the selectivity of ordinary circuit radios is particularly bad, and even four or five are mixed together. In addition to shortening the antenna, reducing the primary coil, and adjusting the antenna circuit, there seems to be no other way to solve the above-mentioned problem. Now the author will introduce a very good method to increase selectivity, which I think will be welcomed by readers! The circuit is shown in the figure. L is the primary circuit coil, L is the regenerative regeneration coil, L2 is the external adjustment coil, and L3 is the grid circuit coil (that is, the secondary circuit coil). The selectivity is excellent according to the design of the figure. The coil can be wound on the spider web board with No. 26 enameled wire. L must be wound more than the ordinary one, and L1 must be determined according to the characteristics of the vacuum tube. L2 and L3 are each wound with 65 turns. Arrange them in the order of the figure, and fix the distance between them after appropriate testing. C and C are both 0.00035 MF variable capacitors.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Small Experience: Method to Eliminate Vibration Noise of Power Supply Square Iron Plate (Zhou Wenhuan) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>The power supply square plate occupies an important position in AC radios (although there are some that do not use it now, but they are still a minority). Its working performance (that is, no heat generation, no vibration noise, etc.) has a great relationship with the sound performance of the machine. The author recently repaired a machine for a friend, and his problem is what I am going to tell you. The machine was assembled by himself with purchased parts. The circuit is a three-tube powerful AC machine. The power supply square plate is also self-made. The volume and selectivity are not bad, but the most hateful thing is that the AC sound is very loud. But after checking its interior, the places where AC sound can be eliminated have been changed, and there is no way to solve it. After I got it for repair, I immediately checked it and found that the iron plates on the west side of the square plate core were slightly vibrating. Pressing it with my hand would reduce the AC sound. At that time, I was sure that it must be the cause of the problem. How to cure it? The method is very simple: just use white wax liquid (that is, wax candles, etc.) and melt it into the gaps of the iron plates. Once it cools down, connect to the power supply, and the hateful AC sound disappears. If any of the readers have the same problem, you may wish to try it. If three-tenths of beeswax can be added to the above-mentioned white wax liquid, it will not become ineffective immediately if the square plate heats up.</p>

<h3 id="e250">Financial Gold Market Turns to a Hesitant Path <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Hardens but Central Bank Intervenes</p>
<p>Therefore, the Drop is Only One Yuan and Two Jiao</p>
<p>After the gold market's previous exciting rise, yesterday people's sentiment was still good and the trend was stable. Unfortunately, the market could not be consistent, and the domestic market was very hard, finally falling back midway. The news of the central bank's intervention was favorable, and the market finally closed flat. In the morning, the overseas silver market rose in England and was flat in the United States. The forward silver price in Monte was flat. The London raw gold rose by five pence. The off-market preparatory transaction opened at 72.3 yuan, then rose to 72.34 yuan. This was because people's sentiment continued to flourish after the previous exciting rise. Fuxing, Yongfu, Yu Dafayong, Yuanmao Yong and other slightly sold and fell. The Central Bank's listing was flat in both England and the United States. The customs gold unit rose by six li. The standard gold price was 991.6 yuan. The morning opening was flat. After the opening, the price fell due to the bank's sales, but low-buying households gathered and the price rose again. Although there was a fluctuation, the major buyers' willingness to buy was strong, and the price finally rose. The bank's prices were expensive and still sold. The sellers took advantage of the situation and gradually fell back. The HSBC listing was flat in both England and the United States, and had little impact. Later, the major buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain the price and competed at around 2 yuan. The silver balance tax was announced to be unchanged and was still taxed at 6%. The English exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling and 5 pence 78125, which also had little impact. Later, as the exchange market continued to harden, the sellers continued to operate and finally retreated to within 70 yuan. After this, the supply and demand were balanced, and there was a lot of struggle after the low. When the Central Bank intervened and sold 140 bars by Tongfen Heng, the price was 960.5 yuan, and people's sentiment was boosted and the price rose back to 70 yuan. However, the selling pressure had not yet disappeared, and the afternoon closing was still below 70 yuan. After the closing, the Associated Press reported that the gold bar article had been ruled in favor of the creditors by the New York State Court, that is, the debtors should repay the debts with the original quality of US dollars, and the price broke through the 70 yuan barrier, so that the market rose immediately after the market opened. Although the buyers were eager to continue to rise after the opening, the exchange market was still loose and the supply was still surging, and the price fell again. The speculator Luo Da still had a buying appetite. After this, the major buyers still sold at high prices, and the Indian silver rose by one Anna, the exchange market hardened and the price still fell, once approaching the 70 yuan mark. After hesitating, the Indian silver shrank by four Annas, and the Associated Press reported that the Bank of China would ship about 600,000 to 750,000 yuan of silver from Mexico on January 21 by the President Monroe, and that the traffic would ship 500,000 yuan of silver coins from Hong Kong to Shanghai on January 28 by the Hoover. At this time, the price rose again. Unfortunately, the transaction was ordinary, and the domestic market was still loose. The upward momentum soon showed a fluctuating trend. Now I will record the day's situation:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 972.4 yuan, a slight drop of 4 jiao compared to the previous closing. The price then rose to 2.5 yuan. Yicheng, Hengxing, Yuanchun Yuan, Yongfu Xingyong all sold and retreated to 0.7 jiao. Dadecheng, Dafayong, Fuxingyong, Dingchang, Yonglizhaofeng, Changruikang retail investors all entered and gradually rose. Yuanmaoyong and Fuxingyong tended to sell and the bank sold USD 4,375 for February, retreating to 3.1 yuan. However, because Yuanyi Qingyuanyuan, Hengfutai, Hengyongde and others all entered, and the speculator Luo took profits, the price rose to 4.7 jiao. Huabi came out with USD 375 for February. Wanxing, Fuxingyongheng, Dafafayong, Yifeng, Hengxing, Hengchangyong and others supplied, and retreated to 2.5 jiao. Shunmao, Shenkang, Yifengyongyong, Litongfu took advantage of the low prices to enter, and rose to 4 yuan. Tianfeng, Fuyu, Fuxingyongheng, Changyongfuxing and others sold again, and retreated to 1.7 jiao. Citibank ate USD 25,000 for March, and Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyongxing, Changyong took advantage of the low prices to enter, and rose to 2.4 jiao. Then, because USD 25,000 for March was difficult to sell, Fuxingyong sold and struggled at around 2 yuan. The silver balance tax was announced and remained unchanged. At this time, the general trend fluctuated. Huabi came out with USD 500 for February. Zhengjin sold USD 3,125 for March. Yuanmaoyong, Zhaofeng, Hengchangyong, Yonglishunmao took profits and retreated to 69.1 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuanyi Chunyuanyong took advantage of the low prices to enter, and rose to 70.02 jiao. At this time, Qianchang, Fushunmao, Hengyu sold, and Ruixing and Fuxingyong entered, and the price was quite strong at around 69.5 jiao. However, as the exchange market hardened, it was difficult to sell USD 3,125 for March, and Yongli and others still sold, and the price fell to 8.8 jiao. Shunmao, Hengyu, Tongfenheng and others took advantage of the low prices to enter, and the Central Bank intervened in spot goods at a price of 960.5 yuan, and immediately rose to 70.08 jiao. Hengchangyong, Fuxingyong, Shengda came to sell, and the price fell to 69 yuan. Retail investors and Fuxingyong and others all entered, and rose to outside 70 yuan. Ruixing, Bingxing, Hengchangyu and others came to supply, and the price fell again to around 69 yuan. Dafayong and Hengyong took advantage of the low prices to maintain the price, and rose to 9.8 jiao. The afternoon closing was 969.6 yuan, and the price rose to outside 7 yuan after the closing.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 971 yuan, and then retreated to 1.2 jiao. Dadecheng, Dalian Gang, and Hengyu came to enter, and the price rose to 2.5 jiao. Fuxingyong, Yicheng, Hengchangyong, Dafayong sold. The bank was willing to offer 1,875 for this month, and retreated to 0.8 jiao. Dadecheng took advantage of the low prices to maintain the price and stabilized. The speculator Luo continued to buy, and the price rose to 2.1 jiao. Fuxingyong and Zhengchang sold and went downstream. The Indian silver initially reported a rise of one Anna. Dafayong and retail investors sold, and the price retreated to 0.3 jiao. At this time, there was no rise or fall, and the price was quite stable. When the second Indian silver reported a small rise of four, four, and five Annas, Wanxing, Fuxingyong, Shunli, Juchang and others all entered, and the Associated Press also reported that the two banks will ship about 1.1 million yuan of silver coins from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and the price rose to 2.2 jiao. Dafayong, Yifeng, Zhaofengchang, Chunyuanyong took profits and the exchange market was still hard, and the price fell to 0.8 jiao. Fuxingyong and Dadecheng continued to buy, gradually rising to 1.9 jiao. Yuanyi supplied, and the closing price was 971.6 yuan. The price was extremely stable after the closing. It was found that the highest price of the day was 974.7 jiao, and the lowest price was 968.8 jiao, with a total rise and fall of 5.9 yuan. As a result, the price fell back 1.2 yuan compared to the previous closing. The settlement price was raised to 991.6 yuan according to the Central Bank's standard gold price, which was about 20 yuan, 4 yuan more than the previous closing. The February registration was 963 yuan, and the March registration was 970 yuan. The morning water supplement was 953 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was 955 yuan. The red gold price was 972.4 yuan. The spot price was stable, and the trend was relatively weak. The Tianjin gang sold 50 taels to Yingfenheng in March, adding 4.5 yuan. Later, only 3.5 yuan was added, and there were few buyers. This was because the Central Bank's willingness to accept was sluggish, and the Central Bank intervened in more than 300 bars of spot goods, which were sold by spot goods numbers such as Tongfenheng at a price of 960.5 yuan, which was about 9 yuan lower than the term standard. As the end of the year was approaching and the source was gradually surging, the Central Bank's willingness to accept was not smooth, so the opening price was extremely low. There was a lack of forward transactions, and it was only heard that Yicheng paid 21 bars of 7.3 yuan to Yuanmaoyong, but it seemed that those who paid 7.5 yuan short were surging. There were still 5,586 remaining bars of the February term, with a total of 21 long parties and 30 short parties.</p>
<p>The transaction in the market was ordinary. In summary, Fuxingyong, Yongli, Hengjingyong, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Dada, Yicheng, Renfayong, Shengda, Tianfeng, Zhaofengchang and others were on the selling side. Wanxing, Futaiheng, Dingchang, Yuanyi Changda, Chunyuanyong, Dadecheng, Shunli, Tongfenheng, Ruixing, Juchang, Tongfu and others were on the buying side. Dafayong, Yuanyi Chunyuanyong, Yuanmaoyong and others first entered and then exited. Shunmao, Ruixing, Hengyu and others first exited and then entered. Dalian Gang and Wanxing did a total of more than 1,100 bars, with a net entry of about 700. Shunli did a total of more than 600 bars, with a net entry of about 200. Guanggang Shengshengda and Hengxing made a sudden entry and exit, and the turnover was still small. The total number of transactions on the day was 30,653 bars in the morning and 11,641 bars in the afternoon. The March term chips totaled 21,182 bars, with a total of 58 bulls and 57 bears.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Banks Eager to Sell, Exchange Rates Ultimately Harden <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches from London, the spot and forward silver prices both rose to 0.0625. Bank of America remained unchanged. The forward price of silver in Monte Video rose by 5 hao to 3.2 li. London gold rose by 5 pence. The exchange rates between British pounds and US dollars, and British pounds and French francs remained unchanged. The US dollar appreciated against the British pound by 0.25, and the US dollar appreciated against the French franc by 0.5 fen. The exchange market opened in the morning with spot selling prices: British exchange at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 0.125; US exchange at 34.875 yuan (January 0.08125 swap points further reduced by 0.0625). Compared with the previous closing, British and US exchanges were both flat. The Central Bank's listed rates were announced, and British and US exchanges were both flat. The Customs Gold Unit rose by 0.06 li, with little impact. After opening, the situation was loose, and banks were quite eager to sell. However, Chinese merchants felt optimistic, and the market tightened slightly at one point. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) listed rates were announced, and British and US exchanges were both flat. Banks took advantage of the high prices to continue selling, gradually loosening the market. Although Chinese merchants tried to maintain the market, they were outnumbered. The process ultimately became loose and flooded. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged, with little impact. The trend gradually hardened. Finally, the Central Bank entered the market with spot purchases, temporarily maintaining the market after the loosening. In the after-market, the Associated Press reported that the US gold clause had been ruled in favor of creditors by the New York court. The news strengthened the sentiment of Chinese merchants, but the exchange market was quite hardened. Banks were also eager to sell. The Indian silver initially rose and then fell. The Associated Press reported that more silver was arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Finally, the market settled at a flat level. At closing, the spot selling prices were: British exchange at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 0.1875; US exchange at 35 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, British exchange loosened by 0.0625, and US exchange hardened by 0.125. Chinese merchants squeezed out approximately 200,000 US dollars.

<p>The foreign money market has gradually stabilized in recent days. The market situation is generally uneventful. Yesterday's foreign call loan rates were 1.5 fen in both the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. However, the overnight rate increased, as the market felt slightly short. Initially, the market opened at 0.5 fen, but quickly returned to 0.3 fen, so the result was not significantly different. Transaction in call loan bills remained sluggish. The total turnover in the morning market was over 2.1 million, with new transactions over 200,000. Afternoon market turnover was over 500,000.

<p>| The Rest of the Bonds Fall Only Slightly |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Stock Exchange was shaken by reports of renewed troubles in Chahar. Many floating longs exited the market, and shorts were very active, gleefully adding to their positions. The number of temporary shorts on the floor increased, and selling pressure suddenly intensified, causing a wave of turmoil. The dull atmosphere of recent days was broken. However, as the matter was just hearsay, the future was uncertain. Many shorts covered their positions at the lower prices. Initially, the selling of the 38th and 48th issues was very heavy, which unnerved investors. Later, buying by northern players stabilized sentiment. Furthermore, covering by shorts in the 16th issue also strengthened confidence. Market attention temporarily focused on the Chahar issue. This volatility is very likely to be triggered as the end of the year approaches and settlement nears. Yesterday, the foreign call loan rate remained at 1.5 fen. The market atmosphere turned weak, and the opening prices immediately fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The 20th, 22nd, 38th, and 48th issues were heavily sold. Retail investors felt uneasy, and more floating longs exited the market. The 20th Customs bond was extremely weak and fell by an additional 0.75 yuan. In the second round, the front-running issues fell slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan due to continued selling by retail investors. The 20th Customs bond rebounded by 0.2 yuan due to the excessive drop in the previous round. The other issues also improved by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The 11th issue saw strong buying interest, mainly from shorts covering their positions. The 16th issue also saw some buying, which strengthened confidence. In the afternoon, the market opened with strong buying interest in the 55th issue. Continued buying in the 16th issue caused prices to uniformly strengthen, mostly by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. As there was no adverse news about the future, the market stabilized at the close, and prices mostly improved by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan. As a result, prices mostly fell by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. Salt tax and 6% issues improved slightly by 0.05 yuan. The price changes were quite uneven. The 20th Customs bond was the most unfortunate, falling sharply by 0.55 yuan. The total turnover was 20,076,000 yuan. The price changes are listed in the comparative table below. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Sinfeng Yanghang reported yesterday (the 17th) that the New York stock market was unusually stagnant after President Roosevelt delivered his message, as traders were unsure of its impact on social legislation and businesses. The market initially strengthened in the morning, then loosened slightly, before turning quiet and rising slightly again. Activity was limited to department stores and a few special stocks. The rise and fall of the major stocks was very narrow. The bond market was firm, but the market sentiment was dull. Small exchange stocks tended to rise. Chicago wheat showed an upward trend. The total daily turnover was 740,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>|              | 16th    | 17th    | Change |</p>

<h3 id="e256">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Rise Then Retract Slightly <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be firm, gradually showing signs of stability. The rise in American cotton boosted confidence. The longs at Tongji and Tongcheng companies became more bullish, and the market became tighter. However, due to the deteriorating surrounding environment and the approaching end of the year, new buyers showed little interest, so there was no new development in the market. Jinji shorts continued to rise. The pre-market opening price for standard yarn was firm due to the American cotton report and positive political news for the longs. Forward prices rose by 25 to 28 points, which further tightened the market. More retail investors covered their shorts. All months rose by 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.7 yuan. The market situation was still rising at the afternoon opening. Transactions were lackluster up to the second and third rounds. Spot yarn transactions were reported to be sluggish. The market price of Japanese yarn was low. The market loosened again at the close, with near and far month contracts falling by 0.2 and 0.4 yuan. Datong sold 250 bales, Yuande 300 bales, Shenji 400 bales, Dachang 450 bales, Gengfeng 750 bales, and Junchang 650 bales. Meiji bought 750 bales, Shenchang 450 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Shengyuan 650 bales, Dafeng 700 bales, Tongfeng 400 bales, and Mingde 300 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Over 800 Bales of Spot Sales. Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, all firms bought a total of 807 bales for the day.</p>
<p>The market is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each firm are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 595, Inland 70, Shantou 25, Yunnan 90, Nanjing 5, Ningbo 7, Changsha 20</p>
<h3 id="e257">Cotton Shorts Very Active <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upwards due to a lack of supply for this month's delivery. As of today, the Cotton Inspection Office has approved 700 dan of Huoji cotton and 1,000 dan of Shanmao coarse cotton, totaling approximately 1,700 dan. As a result, shorts are reluctant to deliver and are actively covering their positions. At the same time, the rise in far-month American cotton is particularly strong, further increasing market prices. The dark market price of Indian cotton White Lokucho rose sharply by 7 rupees.</p>
<p>Insufficient Delivery This Month. In the pre-market opening for standard cotton, American cotton, which had been weak, suddenly turned up, and the rise in far-month contracts was even stronger. Indian cotton coarse grades fell, while fine grades rose. At the same time, although the amount of goods received this month is not large, the shorts are delivering too little, leaving a remaining outstanding amount of over 80,000 dan. Shorts are aware of the insufficient delivery tokens and are forced to actively cover their positions, which has caused the market to rise further. However, large shorts are still safely not covering their positions. All months rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon market, it was reported that the dark market for Indian cotton had surged again by 5.25 rupees. The market situation was still good, but around the 3 o'clock closing time, some profit-takers closed out their positions. The near-month contracts remained unchanged, while far-month contracts fell by 0.05 yuan. Yuanda sold 1,000 dan, Tongji 1,500 dan, Dafu 2,300 dan, Gengfeng 1,500 dan, Shengyuan 1,200 dan, Yikang 1,000 dan, Shenji 1,300 dan, Yuanyi 1,200 dan, and Changfeng 1,000 dan. Dafeng bought 2,500 dan, Changfeng 2,600 dan, Xinheng 2,800 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1,700 dan. The highest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton Sales Still Acceptable. The spot cotton sales market is still sustainable. All factories are actively purchasing. The sources include over 2,400 bales of Yao cotton, 675 bales of Tong cotton.

<h3 id="e258">American Cotton News Favors Longs <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Production Set at 10.05 Million Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with purchases by brokers and foreign firms, and all months rose by 4 to 7 points. Prices then retreated due to profit-taking by longs. After the announcement by the Secretary of Agriculture, market prices rose sharply. However, due to the uncertainty of the Gold Clause case, there was also large-scale selling. Ultimately, buying from local sources and New Orleans drove prices up. Some people believe that in order to protect government loans for aged cotton, new loans will also be issued for next year's new cotton, and the handling fee will be maintained. The market closed firm, with spot prices rising by 15 points, near-month contracts rising by 12 to 13 points, and far-month contracts rising by 25 to 28 points. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices rising by 5 points and futures contracts fluctuating by 1 point. Indian cotton shorts covered their positions and absorbed long profit-taking, with Pingguoer falling by 0.25 yuan, Aumla rising by 3 rupees, and White Lokucho rising by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 17th).</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for White Lokucho cotton on the 18th was 247 rupees, up 1.25 rupees from the previous day's close. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Washington on the 17th, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace announced today that the cotton production target for 1935, according to the Bankhead Act, is 10.5 million bales (500 pounds per bale). He also stated that cotton farmers are willing to abandon up to 35 percent of their cotton fields and receive subsidies (according to government requirements, cotton farmers must abandon 25 to 30 percent). The carryover from 1935, combined with last year's 700,000 bales (478 pounds per bale), totals 11.7 million bales, which proves that they were not sold in 1934.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Heavy Pressure on Flour Futures <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market declined uniformly after opening in the morning. The price of foreign wheat rose by about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in Chicago and about 0.1 yuan in Canada. When the opening price was announced, the market was generally optimistic because the foreign wheat price was favorable. Most market participants inside and outside the industry took a wait-and-see attitude. The opening prices for near and far months were almost the same. However, starting from the second round, the demand from customer firms was weak and the factory sales continued in the forward months, resulting in heavy pressure. Therefore, the market shifted downwards, falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan compared to the initial opening. When the afternoon market opened, the opening price for this month was again unfavorable and even fell below 0.4 yuan to a low of 0.39 yuan. In the forward months, there was buying by longs outside the industry and covering by shorts, so the market briefly rebounded by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Trading remained active until the close. Both sides maintained equilibrium because supply and demand were balanced, and the market price was about the same as before. However, due to the continuous import of foreign wheat, industry insiders generally saw the market as weak. As a result, this month's contract fell by 0.0375 yuan, February's contract fell by 0.025 yuan, March's contract fell by 0.0325 yuan, April's contract fell by 0.0275 yuan, May's contract fell by 0.025 yuan, and June's contract fell by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Wheat Initially Steady, Then Falls <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a trend of initial stability followed by declines in all months after opening in the morning. The prices of foreign wheat were up about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in both Chicago and Canada. When the opening price was announced, the market was stable because the foreign wheat price was favorable. However, the market reversed starting from the second round because of the fall in the flour market and the presence of foreign wheat arbitrage in the market. Investor sentiment weakened. The market situation became even more relaxed in the afternoon market because many people were preparing to deliver spot goods near the settlement date of this month's contract. The far-month contracts also fell as selling pressure was strong. Judging from the current situation, the cheaper price of foreign wheat will likely continue to be unfavorable to longs. As a result, this month's contract fell by 0.09 yuan, February's contract fell by 0.05 yuan, March's contract fell by 0.06 yuan, and April's contract fell by 0.08 yuan. The spot wheat price fell by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan as the standard greatly deteriorated and factory demand was mediocre. Shandong Guide Mingguang wheat opened at 3.84 yuan, and Fuxin Company purchased it.</p>
<p>The drought and cold in the southwest of Chicago wheat are now being discussed by the general public. The market is showing a trend where both gains and losses are possible. Neither the long nor the short sides intend to increase their positions.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Rice Market Stable in the South, Weak in the North <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's arrivals totaled over 40 boats, with a total of 7-8,000 shih of goods. Sales increased slightly as the market had dropped sharply the day before and the prices of various goods seemed to have bottomed out. Sales were seen on this street and Qingdao merchants continued to purchase 6-700 bags. Therefore, the overall trend was stable and slightly tight. Late rice and various thick japonica prices were stable except for the high-grade varieties, some of which had risen slightly. Dujian and Bianyin Yuan and other varieties also stabilized.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday's arrivals from various places downriver totaled over 30 boats. Sales of white japonica short grain were slightly easier. Sales of thin rice Bian Yuan were mediocre and sales of various pointed grains were sluggish. Market prices for high-grade white japonica fell by 0.1 yuan and medium and lower grades fell by 0.01-</p>

<p>丨Soybean Cakes Also Continue to Rise丨</p>
<p>Recently, the market conditions for peanut oil and soybean oil have been such that, due to the lack of supply sources and the gradual depletion of inventories, prices have generally been increasing per unit. However, yesterday's market was influenced by continuous price increases reported from Dalian, leading to tight purchasing in the market. Only a few sellers were able to supply demand, causing a sharp rise in prices. Peanut oil increased by twenty cents, and soybean oil increased by forty cents. The overall outlook remains positive. Since inquiries for soybean cakes from Shantou merchants began, the market for soybean cakes has been quite strong. Yesterday, the spot price for 'Four Brands' soybean cake opened at $1.44.</p>
<h3 id="e263">The Trading of Hardware and Lead Still Struggles to Improve <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The trading of lead has always been most active among red lead factories, paint companies, tin foil factories, and type-setting rooms. Since tea merchants switched to using zinc sheets, the number of lead boxes they require has also decreased, resulting in a less vibrant market than before. In recent months, the market has been sluggish due to oversupply. Despite repeated efforts by businesses to find solutions and promote sales, the adverse environment has hindered any real improvement in trading. Here is a breakdown of market conditions from various merchants:</p>
<p>(Foreign Lead) Arrivals have been frequent recently, resulting in a significant accumulation in the warehouses. However, there has been no activity from local merchants, and only a minimal amount of business from local factories. The resulting market quietness is difficult to describe. Although businesses have been actively promoting sales, the end of the year brings tight credit conditions, preventing large-scale transactions. The market price is estimated at $15.20 per dan (unit), with little change compared to the previous period. A small amount of trading is reported at prices ranging from $15.40 to $15.50.</p>
<p>(Domestic Lead) Although the quantity of arrivals is not high, the limited sales outlets have also made the market quite sluggish. The market price is estimated at $14.70 to $14.80 per dan. Retail sales to smaller shops are priced around $15.00. Daily transactions are only sporadic with few wholesale deals. It is rumored that there is still a large quantity of spot goods in Hankou that can be shipped, causing a sense of weakness in the local market. It is anticipated that the market price may soften in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e271">Protecting Other Species Should Start with Protecting One's Own Kind by Xing An <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Human behavior is always contradictory. Like now, on the one hand, some people are desperately manufacturing airplanes, cannons, and poisonous gases, shouting hoarsely, "Kill! Kill! Kill!" On the other hand, some people are enthusiastically promoting animal protection, expressing sympathy to animals with benevolence.</p>
<p>However, contradictory as it may be, in today's world, even though some people are holding a large bomb in their hands, aiming it at the head of the god of peace and throwing it away, people with a heart may as well develop their own compassionate nature. Just because others are cruel, do we have to be cruel with them? Just because Wang Er next door does bad things, Zhang Wu here should do some good things to influence him. Otherwise, this human world will really turn into hell!</p>
<p>However, for humans, who claim to be the spirits of all things, to now pity and protect those animals that we have long regarded as straw dogs may not be a kind of awakening for humanity: however, this kind of awakening, initiated in the current world of the survival of the fittest, is indeed premature. Because now, humans cannot love each other, let alone extend love to other species? Therefore, I believe that protecting animals today is only a kind of thought of us humans, and it is still far from being realized. If we want to realize this ideal, the prerequisite should be to start with loving one's own kind.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact that the phenomenon of humans killing each other is more severe than in any animal kingdom. The hatred between countries and between races is obvious and easily seen: even people of the same country and the same race often stand in opposition and are incompatible. To put it mildly, it is not uncommon for families A and B to cause great disasters because of minor reasons.</p>
<p>Even with close relationships such as father and son, brothers, and husbands and wives, the affection between flesh and blood should be so deep; however, once they turn against each other, they often do not hesitate to resort to the last resort to deal with each other. This is a bad nature of mankind.</p>
<p>Because humans have this kind of bad nature, they cannot love each other. For a human being who does not even know how to love his own kind, it is impossible for them to bestow grace on other animals and protect them. Therefore, we believe that if humans really have a compassionate heart and are willing to care for animals, the first step should be to start by transforming human nature:</p>
<h3 id="e272">The Sorrow of a University Professor by Jiong Nv Shi <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>As soon as I stepped into the home of Professor Mou of the university, I saw him and his wife sitting side by side at a rectangular desk, busily compiling the lecture notes for Professor Mou's class. A kind of sorrowful expression was displayed on the face of the university professor. Frowning, with a sad face, as if something was on his mind. As soon as Professor Mou saw me, he put the pen in his hand on the desk and greeted me with a face full of smiles, and his wife also busily took out sweets for me to eat. "Where did you just come from? Did anything special happen at the school?" Professor Mou started asking me like this. "Because the professor didn't ask for leave and didn't attend class, I suspected that he was sick! Therefore, I came to visit." I replied aimlessly, which made everyone laugh. Professor Mou and I talked about school matters and personal living conditions. He told me in a very old-fashioned tone:</p>
<p>"A university professor is a signboard that sounds nice in name but is actually poor. I spend an immeasurable amount of energy, only to exchange it for meager living expenses. Think about it: during the day, I have to attend classes, and at night, I have to compile lecture notes and grade student papers: every night, I always have to stay up until midnight to sleep, I am simply sitting until my buttocks hurt. In order to make my position secure, I also have to deal with the school authorities and connect with students;</p>
<p>That kind of mental pain is simply indescribable!</p>
<p>What's more, the current life has no security, and I am constantly in a state of panic! Because the school's salary is not paid, I don't even have car fare these past two days, so,</p>
<p>Today, your homework has to be missed!" Professor Mou spoke to this point in one breath, his face seemed to be covered by a cloud of sorrow, appearing particularly dim! His wife also sighed uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew in from the outside, blowing open the two doors. At this time, the sunlight had already hidden and was no longer on the stone steps just now. It was already approaching dusk. So I said goodbye to Mr. Mou and his wife.</p>
<p>Walking slowly on the way home, I still felt infinitely melancholy. So that's why Mr. Mou was absent from class today! Ah! The sorrow of a university professor!</p>
<h3 id="e273">Stimulation by Qun Ying <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>The bright moon is in the sky, the human shadow is on the ground, quietly returning alone from the road, passing through the small courtyard, seemingly reluctant to leave such a moonlit night, petrified and leaning against the corner of the wall, staring blankly at the clear sky without a cloud, all the sorrows in my heart seem to be washed away at once, slowly watching my own shadow rise and unfold from my heels, as if feeling a burst of chill, I then wearily went upstairs.</p>
<p>In the darkness, I felt my way to the door of the room from the corner, and unexpectedly, the door was wide open. I suddenly twisted the switch of the electric light. My old friend Wei was sleeping on the bed. On the small table beside the bed was a cup of tea, and a wisp of green smoke was still rising from the half-smoked cigarette butts in the ashtray. The alarm clock was pointing exactly at two o'clock. I suddenly remembered that I had invited him over tonight, wanting to steal a day of leisure next Sunday to make a short trip. Recently, I have really felt very tired of life, and every day I am mentally dazed like an insomniac, but there is absolutely no sign of illness. Of course, I know my own heart disease, but knowing is just knowing, and I have no ability to stir up my spirits. A week ago, I had passively immersed myself in dancing every night. At first, I seemed to enjoy those passionate music very much. Every time a piece of music played, I held a snake-like woman and dissipated my annoyance in the atmosphere inside. However, later it didn't have that kind of effect. I sat for two whole nights without dancing a single piece of music, which naturally caused many surprised and despicable glances to be cast at me, so I felt even more disgusted. I thought about asking Wei to leave this stinking metropolis, even if it was only for twenty-four hours on a Saturday.</p>
<p>But I slept a little late last night, opened the front window of the room, and felt that I had seen a moonlit night like this that I had not seen since I set foot in Shanghai, so I put on my autumn coat alone and wandered aimlessly in the moonlit night, walking through many secluded paths, the moonlight being filtered by the leaves of the maple trees beside the road into circles, and I just counted them as I moved forward. I also returned after midnight, and when I got to bed, I got a sweet dream. I also knew clearly that I was pursuing new stimulation, and it would be best to send my life to the kaleidoscope, so that I could live happily every day. Tonight, seeing the moonlight leaking in from the window frame, I went out alone again, but forgot to ask Wei to seek his agreement to the trip.</p>
<p>I slowly walked to the bedside. Wei woke up with a start, turned over, and grasped my hand. I knew he was going to question me about breaking our appointment, but my cold hand changed his question:</p>
<p>"Where did you come back from?"</p>
<p>"Looking at the moon."</p>
<p>Wei understood me best, and this answer was enough to satisfy him, so he didn't ask any more about these things, and directly talked about the reason why I had invited him.</p>
<p>"I want to go on a trip somewhere on Saturday."</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>Wei often encouraged me like this, and the greatness of friendship lies in this. He talked endlessly about the benefits of many scenic spots near Shanghai, although I clearly knew that he didn't know this in such detail.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go to Wuxi."</p>
<p>"Okay! We'll take the night train on Saturday, and there will be a full day. And..." He said with a smile, "You've been too depressed lately, you should look for new stimulation. This week we'll travel, and next week I'll have new tricks..."</p>
<p>"Dancing in the ballroom!" I interrupted.</p>
<p>"Hmph: those women are too annoying. In short, I have a good place to go, I guarantee you'll be satisfied. You have to know that this is the boredom of young people!"</p>
<p>I said the last sentence softly in his ear,</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Burning Toxic Substances Meng Ru <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>The other day, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Headquarters publicly burned all the toxic substances confiscated in previous drug cases. This was undoubtedly a resolute and heartening action. There are many reasons for China's decline, but the weakness of the people's physical health is the biggest fatal wound. If this fatal wound cannot be removed in the future, China may never be able to rise again. The root cause of the people's physical weakness is toxic substances. The government authorities, seeing this, have recently been strictly enforcing the prohibition of toxic substances without any leniency. We only need to look at the successive crackdowns on drug manufacturing facilities in Shanghai over the past few months to know a glimpse of the determination of the authorities. Soon, toxic substances will disappear, the people's health will gradually improve, and the entire country will embark on the road to strength.</p>
<p>However, things are not as optimistic as they seem. Our people have suffered from the scourge of toxic substances for a long time, and it cannot be eradicated overnight. Those who smoke have already become addicted, and it is difficult to quit without a strong will. Manufacturers often risk their lives and families to seek huge profits. The fact is right in front of us. Just a day or two after the burning of toxic substances in this city, didn't the authorities crack down on several more drug cases? This is a good illustration of how difficult it is to eradicate toxic substances.</p>
<p>There is another point that is a major obstacle to the future of drug prohibition. That is, a small number of foreigners often use their nationality as a talisman and their concessions as a safe haven to secretly organize drug manufacturing facilities, producing large quantities of toxic substances to harm our people. Their background is strong, their organization is tight,</p>
<p>their scale is large, and their manufacturing and trafficking are very skillful, making it difficult to crack down on them. Even if we occasionally discover them, they are not subject to our country's laws, so we cannot deter others from following suit.</p>
<p>However, are we discouraged about the prohibition of toxic substances? That's not the case. Although we face many difficulties in prohibiting toxic substances, we still have to find ways to overcome all the difficulties to achieve our goal. This requires the efforts of the authorities!</p>

<p>Wanderers have no home.</p>
<p>I don't like to mention home in front of others, and I don't want to think of home alone. This is not because I want to forget my "drinking water, thinking of the source" home, because in fact, people living a wandering life, even if they miss and love it, is futile.</p>
<p>So, I can only say this.</p>
<p>The wandering life is the most annoying, the experience of sorrow and suffering in the human world especially makes every traveler's heart feel the misfortune of wandering and recall the gentle and comfortable home. Under the spring light of flowers competing for beauty, "the hometown is infinitely good" - who wouldn't think of the loveliness of home? In the lush green summer days, who can erase the pure interest of "fishing in the shade of trees" and "playing the flute in the wind"? When autumn comes, it is a refreshing weather again,</p>
<p>the light white clouds and the sad sound of rustling leaves, even more powerfully stir the wanderer's homesickness! Home in the depths of the white clouds!</p>
<p>However, precisely because I miss my home too much, and the life at home is too comfortable, I am afraid of thinking of home. My elderly father, dear brothers, and the love of blood are deeply etched in my heart. On the other hand, the decline of small-bourgeois families and the difficult financial situation at home make me worried and depressed. Because I am too concerned about family affairs and cannot escape the shackles of real life to return home, I simply don't want to think of home,</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about home! Even if I miss and love it, it is futile.</p>
<p>Since I cannot find a way to solve the difficult life at home, nor can I leave the wandering life and return home to live a loving and gentle life of family happiness. Forever living that sad wandering life, four years have passed, years like water. Since I left home that year.</p>
<p>Wanderers have no home.</p>
<p>I can only say this.</p>

<h3 id="e276">The Youthful Dream Cun Yin <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>The youthful dream has been blown away by the wind carrying fallen maple leaves. Gone, bit by bit! I don't know where to find it?</p>
<p>The youthful dream -- beautiful! Sentimental.</p>
<p>But I don't know where to find it!</p>
<p>Is it the awakening from a dream? Or has the dream vanished? Elusive! Go stand under the plane tree! Watch quietly! Watch the leaves of the plane tree fall!</p>
<p>Wherever the leaves fall, you should know where your dream has escaped!</p>
<p>So I gazed up angrily.</p>
<p>The leaves were blown down by the wind! One piece, two pieces, three pieces...</p>
<p>One piece floated into the gurgling stream.</p>
<p>One piece tumbled on the ground without stopping.</p>
<p>One piece was blown down and fell asleep in a stone crevice.</p>
<p>So many! So many leaves, each with a different destination. My dream? My dream? Oh, the youthful dream!</p>
<p>(I can't remember the year, the month, the day... when my dream began.</p>
<p>(I can't remember which mirror of copper and iron awakened my dream.</p>
<p>(I can't remember which gust of wind blew my dream away.</p>
<p>(Even more, I can't remember where my dream escaped?)</p>
<p>Suddenly, a series of familiar melodies, tenderly crept into my ears!</p>
<p>This is "My Dearest"!</p>
<p>How clear, my memories.</p>
<p>She had beautiful long hair -- like a rose fairy in a fairy tale.</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>I love a stray cat!</p>
<p>Because she's like a stray cat. Her walk is bouncy, her speech is quick, and she has a crisp laugh!</p>
<p>...Oh, and letter after letter -- beautiful handwriting!</p>
<p>The sound of the flute coming from afar, in this lonely night, is quite likely to arouse people's sorrow! The long sorrow is starting today! I remember it well.</p>
<p>In the sound of the flute, she bitterly complained about her own sadness and sorrow!</p>
<p>In the sound of the flute, tears flowed.</p>
<p>In the sound of the flute, we all took advantage of the moonlight's brightness,</p>
<p>paddled our oars, and separated. A vast expanse of white sea: watching her boat sail away. Similarly, she would also watch my boat become gradually smaller!</p>
<p>No one can hear anyone else's heavy sigh!</p>
<p>In this late night.</p>
<p>The youthful dream -- has awakened -- gone, bit by bit! I bid farewell to this dream and finally drifted to the "Land of Loneliness"!</p>
<p>This is a desolate cemetery! I'll stay here, burying my lively youthful life in vain! But I still carry a gloomy heart and dream of a "dream of light"!</p>
<p>The youthful dream. Beautiful! Sentimental.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Standard Great Man in Chinese History Yu Gong <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>In the past, a certain publication asked people to elect female great figures. Now, a certain cigarette company is asking people to elect standard great figures in history. The former included living people in the list of candidates. The latter is only open to the dead. The former was proposed by women, and women voted themselves. The latter is a merchant seeking profit in promoting his cigarettes. Since the motives are different, the nature is naturally different. The former election of female great figures had considerable value in encouraging female compatriots to improve. This time, the purpose is to enable students to receive scholarships, and the meaning of the election has already been lost.</p>
<p>Since the election itself has no meaning, it is close to a matter of "borrowing a topic to elaborate." This will not be discussed. It is just that the list of candidates cannot help but make people feel that it is a strange and interesting game.</p>
<p>I really admire the high opinion of the gentleman who decided on the list of candidates for this standard great man in history. Look how clearly he observed the general weaknesses of the Chinese people? Liu Bowen, who wrote "Tui Bei Tu" and "Shao Bing Ge," is worthless in the modern perspective of breaking superstitions, but he is the most worshipped figure among the Chinese people in this turbulent era, so he is a standard great man. Shen Baoxu, who sought foreign aid and cried at the Qin court, has nothing great about him. However, since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have been hoping that the gold-dollar imperialists would "draw their swords to help when they see injustice on the road"</p>
<p>and begged for assistance from the League of Nations Council, which was too busy to save itself. Shen Baoxu is a typical figure in history,</p>
<p>so he is also a standard great man.</p>
<p>However, in the list of candidates, there are also inexplicable arrangements, such as Zhou Yu, who was clearly the Grand Commandant of Eastern Wu, but is listed among the "civil officials." Zhuge Liang and Zeng Guofan are actually included in the "sages" category. Zhou Yu was probably harmed by his ability to listen to music and appreciate singing, so he is not worthy of being a military general. This may still make sense. How did Zhuge Liang and Zeng Guofan become standard great men of "sages"? Also, Zhang Zuolin and Jian Zhaonan have become "modern heroes." It is not known on what basis this is. Jian Zhaonan is the Chinese cigarette king. This is related to the cigarette company itself, so there is something to say. Zhang Zuolin became a "modern hero." Is this because he made meritorious contributions to the Republic of China as a warlord? This is probably the only reason. If the Beiyang warlord XXX had already "passed away," I think he would definitely be a great man among "modern heroes."</p>

<h3 id="e283">Suggestions for Promoting Domestic Fir Wood (Part Two) Shen Wen <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>(3) Points to note for the construction engineering industry</p>
<p>(A) Fir wood should be used first in construction engineering. According to the usual practice of design and drawing in construction,</p>
<p>foreign pine has uniform dimensions and standard strength. Ordinary wood, except for piles that must use round fir wood, is mostly foreign pine, because it is easy to calculate. However, foreign pine is a foreign product after all. Using one more piece means that one more piece of foreign pine money flows abroad. As long as the domestic fir wood of our country can withstand the same load-bearing force, it can be replaced and used. It is best to use fir wood even for larger dimensions. If special circumstances require the use of foreign pine, then foreign pine is still used. It is better than using all imported products.</p>
<p>(B) Test the strength of fir wood in the field. In European and Western countries, there are precise test standards for the strength of materials for design reference. My country's industry is still in its infancy. Although there are material testing facilities, domestic fir wood has not been tested in the field. There are still a lack of appropriate standards for elastic strength, fracture strength, elastic modulus, etc. At this time when domestic fir wood is being promoted, it should be tested urgently for design and material distribution reference.</p>
<p>(C) Organize a design research association for changing to round fir wood. Now that the strength of fir wood has been tested in the field, it is especially necessary to change the usual method of using square columns for drawing and design to using cylindrical methods, and to clearly define standards to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>However, such standards cannot be reformed rashly without gathering wisdom and common research. Therefore, it is necessary to first organize a design research association for changing foreign pine to fir wood to discuss it.</p>
<p>(4) Points to be improved by fir wood merchants in the future</p>
<p>(A) Change the way of calculating by length to measuring diameter for pricing. As mentioned in the second article, fir wood valuation has too many complex shortcomings in calculation, which easily makes users abandon it. If measuring diameter pricing can be used to provide designers with a simple valuation, they will naturally be happy to use it.</p>
<p>(B) Purchase sawing machines to saw and sell various decoration application wood. Using foreign pine to saw and cut decorations often has the disadvantage of warping and cracking, which many users know. Using fir wood to make decorations can avoid this problem, but it is painful to waste labor and materials, which is not economical. If fir wood merchants can purchase machines to saw and sell ready-made wood for various parties to choose from, on the one hand, wholesale sawing and cutting can save labor costs, and on the other hand, the size of material loss and the sawing of different patterns do not require material loss, which is beneficial to both oneself and others.</p>
<p>(5) The authorities in the wood-producing area should be responsible for suppressing bandits to facilitate the source of goods.</p>
<p>I have heard from woodworkers that the construction of Guangxi's wood production areas is all in areas with rugged mountain roads and bandits出没. The transportation is tortuous. It is difficult for inexperienced mountaineers to go deep into the area. Often, the purchased rafts are robbed by bandits on the way. Extortion of huge sums of money, for this reason, mountain customers often hoard their goods and are unwilling to sell them cheaply. This is also an obstacle to the promotion of domestic wood. It is hoped that the authorities in the wood-producing area will find ways to annihilate the bandits and be responsible for escorting them. On the one hand, it is also hoped that miscellaneous taxes will be eliminated, so that the source of goods will be unblocked and the cost will be reduced, which can be sold all over the country.</p>
<p>The above five points are the points that all sectors of the promotion of domestic fir wood should pay attention to. In addition, the annual leakage of foreign pine is huge. It is expected that patriotic people with a little blood can be moved by reading it and know what to choose. I am ignorant and uneducated.</p>
<p>I feel it in my heart and write it down for a while, so I don't have time to take care of rhetoric. I hope that compatriots at home and abroad will earnestly promote domestic fir wood, and I ask the government to implement promotion and issue orders to the national engineering industry to use domestic products first when applying wood.</p>
<p>This is what I sincerely pray for. It is expected that the demand for fir wood will be huge, and lumber companies will stand tall, like bamboo shoots bursting out, although it cannot recover the past rights and interests, the large reduction in annual import surplus can be expected and awaited.</p>
