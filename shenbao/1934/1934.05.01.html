<p>英外相西門在下院</p>
<h3 id="c1">宣布對日交涉結果　九國公約與特殊權利並舉　不承認日本有單獨决定權　英本國際合作精神助中國 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日英外相西門在下院發表關於四月十七日東京所發宣言之言論時、下院議席皆滿、旁聽席亦爲一般顯要外交家及留心時、局者所佔滿、英國人士對於遠東問題之大注意、可由此見之、</p>
<p>外相首先聲稱、四月二十五日駐日英大使向日外相廣田作友好的詢問、告以在華均等權利及原則、九國公約已以極明白詞句担保之、而日本亦爲簽定此約者之一、英政府必須繼續享受各簽字國所共有之在華權利、不過恊定所限制之權利、如銀團協定者、或日本所有之特殊權利爲他國所承認者、均除外、日方聲明中所表示之對華憂慮、不能適用於英國、英國政策旣以避免碍及中國和平與完整之危險爲目的、故英政府不能承認日本有權單獨决定任何特殊舉動如技術上與金融上之襄助可釀成此種危險云云、</p>
<p>西門續稱、按照九國公約第一條與第七條、日本有權請其他簽字國注意中國境内危及日本安全之任何行爲、此種權利、已以保障給予日本、故英政府以爲日本之宣言非志在侵犯他國在華之共同權利、或破壞日本自已的條約義務、今觀日外相廣田之答覆、可見英政府假定之不誤、日外相曾確告英大使、日本願遵守九國公約之條文、日英兩國政府政策相同、日外相結語聲明日本繼續對於中國門户開放之維持予以極注意云、</p>
<p>西門繼答覆問話、謂日外相廣田之聲明、尚屬明瞭、英政府將即此而止、英政府决計就最大之範圍、並以國際合作之精神、襄助中國趨向和平與繁榮及趨向遠東和諧與好意之進步云</p>
<p>（附註）九國公約第一條條文爲『除中國外、締約各國恊定、㈠尊重中國之主權與獨立、曁領土與行政之完整、㈡給予中國完全無碍之機會、以發展並維持一有力鞏固之政府、㈢施用各國之權勢、以期切實設立並維持各國在中國全境之商務實業機會均等之原則、㈣不得因中國狀况乘機營謀特别權利、而减少友邦人民之利益、並不得奬許有害友邦安全之舉動、</p>
<p>第七條、文爲『締約各國恊定無論何時、遇有某種情形發生、締約國中之任何一國認爲牽涉本條約規定之適用問題、而該項適用宜付諸討論者有關係之締約各國應完全坦白互相通知、』（卅日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">日外務省更正宣言　忽又不公布　廣田靜觀英美形勢　日本將發補充聲明 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（東京）關於十七日外務當局宣言之廣田外相與林德萊英大使之會談内容、廣田外相本定今日公佈、其後因英西門外長在議會之答辯、亦甚簡單、且林大使與外相之會談、英美兩國亦已諒解聲明之眞意、故若無意外發展、日本當不發表、而暫時靜觀、（三十日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日聞外務省已决定不發表上星期四夜送交駐日英大使林德萊之官方宣言全文、外務省發言人宣稱、彼認此事已告結束云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國西門外相定於三十日在議會答辯日政府關於對華政策聲明之眞意、日外務省視其答辯如何、擬發補足聲明、以掃除英國誤解、（三十日日聯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）留此中國學生今日開會、通過一議决案、主張國民政府對日挑釁應取堅决態度、該議决案當卽電達南京、到會者均簽名云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3 id="c4">恢復中國繁榮英宜堅决助華　倫敦每日郵報之主張 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）保守黨之每日郵報、論遠東問題、略謂凡關於恢復中國繁榮之政策、英國宜於堅决援助之、日本卽主張此種政策者、若英國因日本欲達此目的、而與之相爭、則類於癲狂矣、不觀滿洲乎、前爲軍閥逐鹿之塲、自經日本管理之後、秩序整然、前途大有希望、若日本運用其勢力、在中國本部得到同一結果、使外人經商者、悉受其惠、則其要求在中國自由行動之權、吾人固未可厚非之也云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c5">英美將組聯合機關　制日商業競爭　羅斯福代表正與英方接洽　兼籌互惠關稅等經濟合作 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）美國外交家查爾特宣稱、日本之商業競爭、終將促成全世界生活程度之低落、查氏代表羅斯福總統在歐洲研究改善商業狀况、稱彼周遊調查商業、首經英國、在英研究所得、始作此結論云、查氏承認彼尚未發現遏止日本工資及成本低廉足以危及英商之商業競爭方法、查氏續稱、『英友告余、彼信日本技術上之效率、亦爲推動日本競爭之一種原動力、』查氏在談話中表示調查日本之商業競爭、爲彼遊歐之重要目的之一、彼已與英國專家將此問題詳細研究矣、衆信此問題在現時尤屬重要、因英日紡織業會議巳告破裂也、查氏更表示、彼在此間之談話、已商得世界計劃經濟之策、查氏主張設立永久機關、由英美兩國委任高級委員兩人、全年工作、一部份時間用於英國方面、另一部份則用於美國方面、以勸導兩國商業利益、並將籌劃互惠關稅及其他恊定、其他國家之委員亦可採取同樣地位云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日此間宣佈三月二十四日上議院所通過統制日本進出口及修正稅則以保護日本貿易之議案、將於五月一日起實施該案、實施時期爲三年、其目的在保護日本之貿易、以抵制他國對日貨已行或未行之限制、該案授權政府與稅則委員會及商人磋商後、對於指定貨物之出入口得加以限制或禁止、此項貨物之輸入於尋常稅則外、可課以與貨價相等之新稅則、同時亦可减少或完全蠲免之、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c6">僞組織與日宣言美主張統盤解决　保持史汀生不承認主義　日外務省决定對華政策 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>（華盛頓）日本希望、美將許可結束宣言事件、今日似屬渺茫、此問日本人、根據廣田外相解釋、卽四月十七日之宣言與日外相及東京其他官員前次申明之政策、實際雷同之說、希望此日本外交史上興風作浪之一頁告一終結云、惟據此間表示日外相上次向議會正式宣佈之政策、及自中國割裂滿洲、並一手造成『滿洲國』以爲旣成事實、美國對之從未表示接受、若干方面對國務院從未採取放棄史汀生主義之行動、表示深切注意、所謂史汀生主義者、卽美國不承認以武力佔據之土地是也、此間表示、政府官員主張『滿洲國』之地位及最近東京發表之宣言、均係終須作外交解决之公開問題、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）聞外相廣田外次重光葵與駐華日使有吉會商對華政策、已獲完全同意、其主要點爲作徐步穩健的工作以增進中日兩國間之關係、國聯或第三國如干預中日間之問題、應予拒絕、因日本無意侵迫中國之獨立、而日本且願中國之統一也、並决議第三方面之一切計畫、似足妨阻中日關係恢復常態者、應予反對、中日間各稱爭案之解决、應由中日直接談判以成之、此節適用於兩國間政治經濟文化關係之釐定、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英政界盛傅日本擬與中國開始直接交涉、『每日導報』稱、日方堅持下列要點、卽承認『滿洲國』、承認日本在華北特别在北京一帶之『特殊利益、』中國未得日本同意、不得舉外債、中國應接受日本之援助與合作、從事政治與經濟之復興、同時中國海陸空軍除日人外、不得聘請外籍顧問、（二十八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c13">俄德與波羅的海問題 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>據近數日外電稱。蘇俄前向德國政府交涉保障波羅的海各國安全問題。已經德國拒絕。以是波羅的海之安全。又有感受威脅之虞此一問題雖爲純粹歐洲性之問題。表面仍與今日之遠東問題無關。然細察之。實與遠東未來局勢。有莫大之關係。蓋德國在今日之歐洲。已處於四面碰壁之地位。舍揭反赤之旗幟以向波羅的海各小國發展。已無他路可走。其心理狀態。大類今日之日本。日自九一八以來。每以防止赤俄勢力東侵之說。宣傅於國際間。一若彼以反俄前鋒自任則國際間必能諒解。而可坐收侵我東北之利者。德之希黨。所以不能忘情於波羅的海之各國。亦爲此同一心理所驅使。德自最近圖奥失敗。已使希黨得一敎訓。卽了解法意系統之國家。皆無德國發展餘地。故自今而後。一綫希望。僅能寄之於波羅的海諸國。彼以爲若能於此方發展。卽不啻隱然自任爲歐西各國反俄之前鋒。或可邀各國間之同情也。此種心理之錯誤。自有他日之事實爲之反證姑勿具論。惟德若一日不捨棄其此種心理者。則實足牽掣蘇俄對日之行動故於遠東問題之發展。雖似無關。而實大有關係也。</p>
<p>蘇俄所以重視波羅的海各國者。以此等國家。鄰接蘇俄之歐西部分。地理上成爲蘇俄之前衛。於蘇俄政府成立之初。英法各國。不特於此封鎖蘇俄。且藉此爲進攻赤黨之根據。故此一區域。在軍事上實爲歐西國家對俄用兵與蘇俄防禦他國侵略必爭之地。更觀蘇俄與此等國家所締結之不侵條約。皆有不許第三國假道進攻兩締約國之規定。可知蘇俄用意。實以波羅的海各國屏障他國侵俄之塗徑。然波羅的海諸國。國力皆弱小。究不能成爲蘇俄强有力之堡壘。惟其如此。故仍未能袪俄人西顧之憂。蘇俄之所以與德談判保障此一區域之安全問題者。其意蓋在乎此。</p>
<p>德自圖失敗而後。卽與波蘭締結十年不侵條約。此舉似與希黨恢復祖國領土之宿願。大相逕庭。然就德國今日之地位論。要亦爲無可如何之辦法。蓋波蘭爲法之與國。且其現有之實力。亦遠在德國之上。爲希黨計。自惟有暫捐前嫌。强顏爲歡之一辦法。而其對於波羅的海各小國之態度則大異。不獨靳與締結不侵條約。且嗾使希黨。大肆活動。此爲屢見前此報章之事實。及至最近。吏有拒絕蘇俄保障安全之議。其用心所在。蓋欲乘日俄戰爭爆發之機。藉東普魯士之根據地。以侵陵此等國家耳。蘇俄今次之提議。實已洞見德國之野心。故預爲設謀以應付之也。</p>
<p>今就外電觀之。波羅的海各國之態度。雖皆對德皇慮。然亦雅不欲蘇俄之出而代謀。是殆恐蹈着受人保護之嫌。以喪失其獨立國之尊嚴。固具苦心。惟就我人觀察。蘇俄此一行動。外交上已處於勝利地位。蓋一則德匣對於波羅的海各國之野心。至是已充分暴露。二則波羅的海各國。因受希黨之威脅。將因此而結成對德之共同陣線。三則法英各國。爲防止希黨之向東發展。遲早心將出而担保此數小國之中立。故德人在此方面之發展。或將如前此圖奥一舉同歸失敗。亦未可知。則此問題之將來如何影響於遠東。亦可因此而思得其半矣。</p>

<p>（南京）陳立夫三十日晨、在中央紀念週、報告生之原理、内容盡屬創見、極爲精闢、原詞略謂總理遣敎有二句話生是宇宙進化之重心、民生是人類歷史的重心、總理更有系統地說明這個道理、民生是進化的中心、而進化是歷史的中心、所以民生是人類歷史的中心、全部三民主義、最重民生「建設之首要在民生」、民權發達民族平等、可以說都是輔助民生的解决的、所以總理斷然地下了這個定義、「民生是人類進化的重心」、民生史觀、中華民族、歷數千年、依然能够存在者、决不是僥倖、卽在能有這種認識而產生出民族自信的力量、什麽是生命、其方程式如下、㈠物質加精神等於生之體、㈡空間加時間等於生之用、㈢生之體加生之用等於生命、物質和精神僅是生元組合、而具有相對的動態差别、換言之、以最短之時間占住最長之空間、其所表現者爲精神、以最長之時間占住最短之空間、其所表現者爲物質、總理在「孫文學說」中名一切生之份子單位爲生元、生元能動能靜、因而有各種的組織、各種的形態、所表現之可見者爲物質、不可見者爲精神、兩者合起來就成爲整個生之體、有了生之體猶應懂得時空間之應用、蔣委員長常打勝仗、以其能活用其軍隊、卽能知道時空間之運用、有很適當的配備、譬如閩變發生、一般人很恐慌、那知道蔣委員長早已派遣軍隊、駐在閩浙邊界、卽在正確之時間内、已經占住正確之空間、所以不旋踵而將閩亂敉平、就是時空間運用得當之故、十九路軍雖有豐富的槍械、和戰鬭力、生之體雖經健全、但是不懂得生之用、所以依然失了生命、生之體加上生之用、卽有全部之生命、一部易經就是闡明生命原理之偉大著作、不過他所用的名詞、並不和我所說的一樣、而爲理實無二致、易經說、陰陽時位、陰陽配合、各有其所占、至時間與空間、卽所謂時位、本此陰陽時位、遂演成八卦、更由此而六十四卦三百八十四象、以至於無窮、必須陰陽時位都配合得很適當、易經就是專門研究如何方爲適當的配合之一部大著、陰陽配合最高理想爲中和、中卽合理之謂、和卽配合或均衡之謂、中和的結果、一面能維持一切組織本體的生存、一面能運用動利而推進、所以說、「致中和天地位焉、萬物育焉、」空間占領之最高理想爲中正、卽適當之位置、不正則不動、過正則偏、過與不及都不是適當、所以必須中正、時間控制之最高理想爲中庸、卽合理的長存庸者用也、不偏之謂中、不易之爲庸、不偏不易就是合理的不變之意、持續和運用適當的時間謂之中庸、中和之目的爲優生、卽是良好的生存、中正之目的爲廣生、卽希望大家都得公平的生存、中庸之目的爲長生、中華民族因發明了陰陽時位、及進而發明了「中和」「中正」「中庸」這些道理、且必須爲「合理之和」「合理之正」「合理之庸」、所以要「中」「中」就譬如是一個樞紐、「和」「正」「庸」便是系於「中」的三個不同機關、莊子齊物論說、「樞始得其環中以應無窮、」這眞是中國哲學上很偉大的發明、簡括的說、由中所發出之和、其目的爲優生、由中所發出之正、其目的爲廣生、由中所發出之庸、其目的爲長生、則所謂和正庸、可以說「一是皆以中爲本而以生爲用矣、」那麽、我們就可以認爲這便是「生之一體三位」、中國有了許多聖人革命家、對於生之原理、已發揮得如此透澈、爲什麽還不能很强盛優越、卽因現代多數智識份子、在革命破壞之趨勢中、都將這些道理一齊抛到字紙簍裏去了、總以爲自已的不好、外國的都好、殊不知歐美的文明、也正在走向义路去、我們如果十分明瞭三民主義、一定相信什麽共產主義·資本主義·法西斯主義都没有三民主義的偉大、因爲他的好處、三民主義都包括盡了、唯有三民主義才是建設生之全部得全體大用、我們要懂得知難行易的道理、未知的努力求知已知的趕快實行、就是心理精神的建設、一面衣食住行種種資料、如何去補充創造、就是物質的建設、特質旣充、精神又備、當然整個生之體是健全的了、中　先生要恢復中華民族的固有道德智能和創造力組織力、一面應迎頭趕上西洋文明、用以補充物質條件之不足、所以他又告我們、革命不能專門抄人家的成法、我有我之歷史背景、（時間）特殊環境、（空間）和方法、忘了時空間之關係、那簡直不成革命、更談不到生之用、所以他說「務須依照余所著建國方略·建國大網·三民主義及第一次全國代表大會宣言、繼續努力、以求貫澈、」中山先生是一位醫學家、他運用醫人之理來醫國家、醫民族醫世界、以求優生廣生和長生、所以他又是生理學家、他所應用的、全是「生之原理、」三民主義的偉大、眞是奥妙無窮、必須經過深切的體騐、和不斷的研究、才能懂其含義之萬一、蔣委員長發起新生活運動、也就是看到生之原理這一點、所謂禮義廉恥等美德、以達衣食住行之需要、都是民族主義所呌我們實行、以之充實民族的精神和物質的條件、中華民族過去已有如許的偉大發現、今後如更發揚之光、大之必可成爲長生優生的民族、而且還要廣生、卽求全世界人類都得到長生和優生、是之謂大同、年來國民革命的積極進展、已予垂危的民族一種偉大的生機、今後更應依據生的原理、發展其建設的能力、一方恢復我國固有的往昔智能、將從前的文化、從根救起來、一方對西洋的物質文明、迎頭趕上、革命的事業方得完成、我們旣担負了這個責任、就不能不對生之原理有深切的認識（卅日中央社電）</p>

<p>惟財部當局、對於該銀團此舉、認爲其中尚有窒碍難施處、故雖經孔部長口頭允許於前、但遲遲未予批准、因此該銀團原定發行之日期、無形展緩、現則已由孔部長與李馥蓀等商洽决定、由財部貼償該銀團籌備損失洋十萬元、該銀團籌備發行之擔保證券、則遵令停止進行、</p>

也總須四五元，汽車費還没算進—因爲離城太遠要去洗澡非坐車不可。　　這天我們起得很早，七點鐘就出發，先玩明孝陵，建築還不錯，就是荒凉陳舊不堪，徒供憑吊而已·出明孝陵，重上汽車，不到兩三分鐘，那宏偉富麗的中山陵已顯在面前，我們就拾級而登，舉目四眺，果然不凡，和明孝陵大不相同，四周滿站着衛兵，整潔壯嚴的空氣滿佈着，當我們一步步走到了國父的石像前，每個人的呼吸早急促得不成樣子，因爲那石堦實在太高了啊！　　離開中山陵，皮喇叭一喔喔一幾聲又把我們載到了靈谷寺，就在寺裏客廳上泡了幾杯茶，大家拿出帶着的餅乾，糖果大嚼而特嚼，因爲這時已近正午六家肚裏正有些餓了。塞飽了肚子，又走到離靈谷寺很近的譚院長墓去玩，道裏建築得十分曲折美麗，與中山陵的壯嚴偉大各具風味，在一點鐘以後，我們離開了譚墓重登汽車，向湯山進發，一會向上，一會朝下，走的都是山路、大約經過了三四個山頭，汽車就停在湯山的陶廬門前了。　　我們先在飯廳旁的休息室坐下，這裏坐的是絲羢沙發，站的是嵌花地毯，四壁是錦繡屏條，佈置得十分華貴，我乎夾着一枝香烟，靠在沙發上，交　着兩脚　得高向的忘記了自已的一切，看看自已的衣裳是綢的，手中的香烟是白鍚包，再看看四周的陳設，我頓時尊貴起來，覺得自已是個貴人，至少也是個富人。誰知我正在得意洋洋拾架子的時候，做東道的周崇德君立在我面前一喂好夫洗澡了。』我頓時如夢初醒，才想起這枝白鍚包還是他請我吸的，我原來只是一個吃金字塔的朋友。　　我踱出飯廳轉個灣，從葡萄棚裏走進去，侍者在前面領導着說··『到了。』我一看和普通的浴室一樣，並没有分别，就是所洗的水不同一點，普通浴室是河水，這裏是泉水，不過這泉水是不用燒而天然熱的，大槪就可貴在這一點。　　這裏一切佈直，和上海各大浴室的洋盆差不多，也是休息室連着浴池，不同的地方，就是門有鎖，你進去了絕對没有人來侍候你，假使你帶了太太，儘可以一同進去洗，聽說這裏是野鴛鴦消遙地，因爲城裏的軍警查旅館房間十分嚴密，所以這溫泉浴室的生意着實不差。我這天就看見三對，都是在這陶廬洗澡的、并且它浴室的樓上就是旅館，假使你洗得疲乏了、儘可到樓上去安睡一　。這裏的旅館，絕對没有丘八太爺敢來嚕擾。查問。據說他們的理由是··『這是最上等人的浴室和旅館，不會發生任何亂子的。』同時又偏偏有許多官廳認爲『有傷風化』的喜劇，一齣齣發生在這裏，這眞是多麽够玩味的矛盾的現象啊！</p>

<p>自由談	論著作  曹聚仁　　（一）昨天，從書櫉中翻檢注中的述學，是一部嘉慶年間的原刻本。汪中在乾隆時，負一代盛名，他的遺著直到他死後二十多年纔梓刋行杨；在他生前，述學僅有鈔本，流傳於友生間。述學刋本上有王念孫序文，謂其洽經『振煩袪惑而得其會通』，其爲文則一合漢魏晋宋作者而鑄成一家之言、淵雅醇茂，蓋宋以後無此作乎矣一。從某一方面看，這並非溢美的阿譽。可是和汪中同時的史學家章學誠，却譏笑述學算不得著作，謂：　　『其人（汪中）聰明有餘而識力不足、恒得其似而不得其是。·····今觀汪氏之書矣·所爲内篇者，大約雜舉經傳小學，辦别名詁義訓，初無類例，亦無次序。苟使全書果有立言之宗，···則此紛然叢出者亦當列於雜篇，不但不可爲内，亦并不可謂之外也。·····觀其外篇，則序記雜文，泛應詞章，斯乃興述學標題，如風馬牛。列爲『外篇』，以擬諸子，可爲貎冋而心異矣。『（立言有本）　　汪中的述學算不得著作，那些陳列在我的書櫉裏的、可以稱之爲著作的豈不太少了嗎？而今日坊間出版的書籍，豈不都變成牛溲馬勃，不能入著作之林了嗎？　　古人重視他逢已的著作，一生精力貫注在某一種或某幾種研究上面，說是要『藏之名山，傳之其人。』『藏之名山』原不過是這麽一句話，但生前增訂修改，周詳綿密，直到晚年或身笔纔刋印行世。顧亭林日知錄，看是一種讀書隨筆；别人以爲他一年可以寫成幾卷，他却說··『自别來』載，早夜誦讀，反復尋究，僅得十餘條。』筆記之類，這樣不苟作；整然的著作，更非『寢饋以之』不可。亭林作音學五書，凡經三十年，所過山川亭障，無日不以自隨；凡五易稿而乎書三次。近人梁啓超作清代學術槪論，自屬稿至脫稿，僅費十五天工夫，較之古人可謂奇蹟。清代學術槪論在商務刋成單行本，和改造雜誌所載全無不同；卷端公然有『更無餘裕覆勘，舛漏當甚多』的自識，古人更當視爲怪事。　　二、　　顧亭林與人書云··『嘗謂今人纂輯之書，正如今人之鑄錢。古人采銅於山，今人則買舊錢，名之曰廢銅，以充鑄而已。所鑄之錢，旣已粗惡；而又將古人傳世之寳，春到碎散，不存於後，岜不兩失之乎？』凡是有眞價値的著作，都是采銅於山的工作。司馬遷，『南遊江淮，上會稽，探禹穴，　九疑，浮於沅湘，北涉汶泗，講業齊魯之都，觀孔子之遺風，鄉射鄒　，厄困都薛彭城，過梁楚以歸。』他躬親考察調查，以事實與記載相對勘，才鑄成史記那麽一個大鼎。顧亭林避仇北遊，二十餘年間，足跡遍北方諸地。每次出遊、』以二馬二騾載書自隨、所至阨塞，卽呼老兵退卒，詢其曲折；或與平日所聞不合，則卽坊肆中發書而對勘之。所至荒山頽阻，有古碑遺蹟，必披榛莽，拭斑蘚讀之。····其成就多在出遊間。』所以他的天下郡國利病書，並不是書生空疏之論。朋友  黄凱音　　我在小學的時候，看同學們變小戲法，『耳中聽字』呀，『紙人出血』呀，很以爲有趣。廟會時就有傳授這些戲法的人，幾枚銅元一件，學得來時，倒從此索然無味了。進中學是在城裏，於是興致勃勃的看大戲法，但後來有人告訴了我戲法的秘密，我就不再高興走近圈子的旁邊。去年到上海來，才又得到消遺無聯的處所，那便是看電影。但不久就在書上看到，點電影片子的製造法，知道了看去好像知丈懸崖者，其實離地不過幾尺，奇禽怪獸，無非是紙做的的。這使我從此不很覺得電影的神奇，倒往往只留心牠的破綻，自已也無聊起來，第三回失掉了消遺無聊的處所。有時候，還自悔去看那一本書，甚至於恨到那作乾不該寫出製造法來了。　　暴露揭發種種隱秘，自以爲有益於人們，然而無聊的人，爲消遺無聊計，是甘於受欺，並且安於自欺的，吾則就更無聊賴。因爲這，所以使戲法長存於天地之間，也所以使暴露幽暗不但爲欺人者所深惡，亦且爲被欺者所深惡。　　暴露者只在有爲的人們中有益，在無聊的人們中便要滅亡。自球之道，只在雖知一切隱密，却不動聲色，帮同欺人，欺那自甘胺欺的無聊的人們，任牠無聊的戲法一套一套的，終於反反覆覆的變下去。周圍是總有這些人會看的。　　變戲法的時時拱手道··『··出家靠朋友！』有幾分就是對着明白戲法的底細者而發的，爲的是要他不來戳穿西洋鏡。　　『朋友，以義合者也』，但我們向來常常不作如此解。紀游  猛克　　上海的氣候雖然變化得快，在今年春天，可出遊的晴朗日　也却並不少。今朝才醒，就看見身子沐浴在淡黄色的太陽光中。我勇敢地跳起，要破格的早起一回。推開窗，晨風凉颼颼的。隣家晒台上，已立着兩位小孩，用勁的擎住紙鳶，在試風哩。『又是難得的春日！』我披上了大衣，找着根打狗棍，槖槖地，怱怱跑下樓，走出門去。那意思，彷彿是要尋個地方遊一下子。　　遊必須名山在川，然而在現在這樣的世界，身非名公大人、未必有配遊的資格。廬山自然不敢去，杭州？連車錢也不够。但我終天被載在一輛華商的公共汽車上，向眞如送走了。　　車子忽然顚簸得催人嘔吐。面朝車窗，則東方圖書館已赫然在望，那殘存的石牆和圓柱，眞好像看照片上羅馬敎堂的遺跡。馬路旁的舖店，雖然曾經誰費過一番苦心破壞，但閘北的市政究竟是復興了，如當舖之類的建築物，就偶然也有幾處小興土木。　　車子更加搖幌着身子，性急地追趕什麽似的，那蔚藍的天底下，遙遠的樹林，田野，和人家，也像被什麽吸引着，飛也似的向我奔來。鄉下也誠然可愛的，單是這些景物，一跳進久居大都市的人們的眼中，就至少要覺得新鮮。所可惜者，是這彷彿多餘的一條欠伸得畢直的人工馬路，還有偶然哺哺馳過的幾部汽車。在什麽田　詩人看來，這就不免有些傷雅。倘若是一條蜿蜒而不舖煤屑的『天然』官道，有幾張肩輿互相招呼着往還，或者還添幾把嘰呀嘰呀的土車子，上載一兩位紅鞋細脚的鄉下姑娘，那倒很有意思了吧。　　我在圍繞着水菒攤子的地方下了車沿着一條溪澗漫　地走。澗邊有不少洋槐，有時也可看見幾株楊柳，太陽通過枝葉，在水面印出千百條影痕，接蓮地位長，跟着又一同隱去。澗水倒流得並不急，然而色是渾的，臭味特濃，簡直使你連片刻的停留也不敢。偶然也搖來一些船隻，都吃水甚重，察其内容，却原來滿是黄金色的肥料。　　行不上半里，澗流穿進一個小市鎭。看入鎭的指路碑，這　是近邊還辦有一個專爲華僑子弟们讀書的大學堂的眞如市。鎭上的街道，大約不及三尺寛，倘有兩位不留神的行人，對面搖擺着走過，那是難免要碰傷臂膊，發生　角的吧。街石有的斷了，有的塌下，有的還豎直半截身來，從洞口探望下去，便隱約看得見黑色的汚水，潺潺地奔流。除了幾家雜貨店外，大多是飯館，麫館，茶館之類。生意都好得很，特别是茶館的客人多。伙計們呵嗬地呼應着，提了一把銅壺兜圈兒。不少渾身泥濁的骯髒漢子，將籮擔任意的横擱在街心，捲起袖子去選就一個滿意的坐位，要茶要水，尋找人談閒天。可見鄉下人雖然不修邊幅，很不像人樣子，但對吃喝的事，却也一樣高興的。假設我們偶然也坐在這樣的茶館裏，一面喝茶談話，一面聽着街石下潺潺的流水聲，那眞不知是一種什麽味兒呢。全鎭棋格式的組織着七八條街，中段被澗水分開了，有幾座石橋連絡着交通。橋下是不寂寞的，許多糞船停靠着，男子漢聚在船頭抽旱烟，女入們提着桶衣裳走下橋去，遠遠的就互打招呼，哈哈地胡調。『入鮑魚之肆久而不聞其臭』，這話是眞不錯的。然而我終于掩住鼻子，趕緊的往回走，一直走出了這市鎭。　　天藍而高，太陽當中掛着，我卸了大衣，覺得熱、但只要有口風來，便又一身輕了，這確是難得的春日！不過我的遊的興致，早已闌珊，就這麽的向着那有寛闊的馬路，有摩天的大厦的上海走去。隨筆之類  陳子展　　汽油與香水　　予居滬十已久，尚畏坐汽車，尤其是公共汽車。每　汽油之氣，輒頭昏心惡，不能自支。又每遇座有摩登婦女，厚施脂粉，濃灑香水者，亦覺香氣刺鼻，殊不可耐，必移遠座以避之。因憶明朝有名醫葛乾孫者，善治奇疾。有富家女，病四支痿痺，目瞪，不能食，衆醫治岡效。乾孫命急去房中香奩流蘇之屬，掘地坎，置　女其中。久之，女手足動，能出聲。投藥一丸。明日，女自坎中出矣。據云以此女嗜香，脾爲香氣所蝕，故得是症。第未知今之婦女亦有嗜香成病者否？如其有之，則除以短褲絲襪而得之寒腿症外，又是一種摩登病矣。　　清潔之政　　殷刑棄灰於道者，清潔之政，蓋古已有之歟？惟過於干涉，轉爲苛政。南史儒林傳云，遂安令劉澄，爲性彌洯。在縣掃拂郭邑，路無横草，水翦蟲穢，百姓不堪命，坐免官。此清潔之政擾民之一例也。同書又云，可佟之一日之中，洗滌者十餘遍，猶恨不足，時人稱爲水淫。是則個人過潔，亦成怪癖。元季名畫家倪瓚好潔，盥濯不離手。俗客造廬，比去，必洗滌其處。此亦何佟之一流也。更正　　四月十九日本刋所載『拉波里的液化節』一文，内叙意大利人求神顯靈不得則駡··『猪玀！臭貨！』此係借用我國通用字眼，或有形容過當之處，亦未可知，因外間來函詢及，特此聲明。故鄉行（五）  林微音　　他看我不說話，便接着註解地說；『你的婆一年三百六十日末要碰七百二十日的和『我陪說了她末天在頭上。』　　儘是那樣的話，我不敢再　下去了。我告訴了他誰還要來，我要到旅館去看看，也許他們已來了。在我受了他的我爲什麽不住到他家裏去的責怪以後，我就告了辭。　　他們還没有來。我問了末班輪船到的時間，說是要來快了，我便到了輪船碼頭去。到了那里，才知末班輪船已到，可是我没有碰到他們。我便再回旅館，他們也並不在，那他們今天一定不來了。我似乎感到了失望，雖然來了也明知同他們是没有什麽話可談的。　　天是在黑下來了，我又離開了旅館向大街上走去。我在那大街上在來回地走着。由那來回的走，我領悟到了一件事，就是那樣的走大槪就是我的命運。　　在上海，我總是說我的所以不肯躭在家裏，因爲家裏有大人小人，煩。要是我獨自住，我就不會那樣儘往外邊跑了。可是現在在旅館裏我是一個人，而且預先帶了原稿紙，筆中也裝滿了墨水，是預備寫一些什麽的，然而一樣地坐不住。因此我還想起了，在北京，在南京，在桂林，在廣州，就是在上海，我都一個人住過，可是還是成天地在街上跑，在公衆的塲所坐，只不肯在家裏躭只不肯在家裏躭，我在那大街上在來回地走着。　　想已到了吃晚飯的時間，可是我並不餓。每在我走過那賣飯的石家飯店的門前時，我總不自主地向裏面望一望。我總該進去吃些什麽，我覺得。飯吃不下，可喝一些酒，在這樣地向自已訴請着。我便進去了。我要了一　　，並且聽從黨官的推荐，這要了一　紅燒　魚尾。隨同酒，他先拿上來了一碟拌馬蘭頭。可是酒並不像别桌上的用串简一樣，却用茶壺貯着。這顯得勉强，而且不調和。可是我也並没有再去爲難堂官，就這樣聽它　去了。酒的味不很好，可是也終於喝完了；魚也只吃剩骨頭。吃得過分地飽，而且還有些醉意。從這個石家飯店直接地回到了那個石家飯店，並没有再在街上徘徊··到了，便預備睡了　　早上起身得早，晚上睡得尤其早，這一天是一個同平常多麽不同的一天。　　翌日，跑了十餘里路，到了那鄉下的親戚家；道了喜，吃了午膳，又跑了十餘里路，回到了木凟。再從那里，由一頭輪船和一節火車來到了上海。　　我是這樣地去了一次故鄉。篇中世紀的小說（四）  美國Ｍａｒｋ　Ｔｗａｉｄ著（尊寒譯）　　『你讓步了，你終於議步了。你可以愛我的。你願意爱我呀，啊！你說聲願意愛我罷，我親愛的，我熱懋的龔娜！』　　龔娜發出一聲悲歎。他現得面無人色。他開始像一片柳葉一般顫慄着。隨後，傷心到了極點，他一面把那少女推開，一面呌道··　　『你不懂得你所要求的是什麽！這事是永不可能的。』接着他便像一個罪犯一般逃走了，留下那可憐的郡主在那兒一聲不響，簡直嚇呆了。過了一會，當她還留在那裏呌着哭着時，龔娜也在自已的房内呌着哭着；兩人都痛苦極了。兩人都看到自已憪途的崩滅。　　過了一些時候，康絲坦絲才慢慢地回復過來，一邊離開那裏，一邊說道··　　『啊！當我正以爲他那殘忍的心被我打動了的時候，他竟衊視着我的愛情！我恨他！他把我推開了，他像推開一匹狗一樣把我推開了』！　　（四）　　時候過去了。那仁慈的公爵的女兒重又現出永遠消失不掉的悉容。以後大家再也不見她和龔娜在一塊了。這事使得公爵非常難過。可是接連幾星期後，龔娜的臉色却已復原，他的兩眼又像以前一樣奕奕有神了，他繼續以一種明敏的且日益熟練的才能處理國務。　　不久，爵府裏流行了一種奇異的風說。這風說漸漸大起來，且散佈開來了。城裏的街谈巷議更把它流佈出去。它竟傅入了整個公國。我們聽到大家耳說··『康絲坦絲郡主生了一個』小孩啦？』　　當這風說傅進克魯根斯坦伯爵的耳裏時，他便把那有着羽飾的盔兜圍着腦袋舞了三次，呌說道··　　『龔娜公爵萬歲！好啦，他的爵位現在是牢穩了。德清完成了他的使命。這勇敢的惡徒算得不曾辜負他所得的報償呢！』　　他於是到處傅播這新聞。在四十八小時内，他那男爵領地内，没有一個人不是舞踏着，歌唱着，排着酒席，燃着燈火，來慶祝這重大的事故，這一切費用都是由那老克魯根斯坦男爵慷慨而且歡欣地支付出來的。　　（五）　　訴訟正在進行着。勃郎登堡公國所有的貴人和男爵都集合在公爵府的法庭裏。没有一個空位　可以容得一個觀客坐下或立着。　娜穿了鑲着黄鼠狼皮的紅袍，坐在首相的席位上；兩邊列坐着公國的那些大法官。老公爵曾嚴厲地吩咐過他女兒的案件要毫不留情的審判，隨後便痛心極了地睡上牀去了。他的餘日是屈指可數的。那可憐的龔娜曾經像給自已求命一般地要求别人免去呌他去審判他的堂妹的那番苦痛，可是人家不允許。　　在那人數衆多的集會裏，最悲苦的一顆心是在龔娜的胸裏。　　而那最快樂的一顆心却在他父親的胸裏。因爲那老克魯根斯坦爵没有給他女兒　見，已悄悄地來了！他雜在貴族之羣裏，爲了自已的家門日益宏大而洋洋得意着。　　傅令使已把例有的公文宣讀過了。其他的手續也已完畢了。那尊嚴的司法大臣聞口說道··『被告，請你起立！』　　不幸的郡主立起身，面上毫無遮蓋的對着大衆。司法大臣繼續說··『極高貴的郡主，在這公國的諸位大法官前你被控告並經證實未曾有過神聖的婚姻關係而產生了一個小孩。根據我們古來的法律，這犯罪是要被處死刑的。現在你祗剩着一個球解的辦法。攝政公殿下，我們仁愛的君主龔娜將把這辦法正式通告你。留心聽罷『。</p>

精義，卽小見大，固何獨交際電而不然？姑錄所言，以作臆說可乎？公用電話問題電信記者　　本刋自發行以來，常接各界來函，對於電信問題，有所討論及商椎，集思廣益，足爲本社同人之參考，並足見各界關心電信事業之熱烈。現在經記者代爲提出者，厥爲公用電話問題。此事在歐美早得具體解决，在我國則據所聞見，惟上海一地，議及施行，各地槪少見焉。來函署名者爲唐君彬如，茲將其中大意，約舉如下：　　『我………國普通人家，启已不裝電話者，向人借用，稱爲「借打電話。」「借打電話」，實在　煩已極。肯借者大都雙方熟識，素具感情，否則隣近之家，未便借用，須奔走更遠，或婉言商懇。或者以爲自已出費裝一電話，當然解决一切，但試爲考慮，平時通話不多，有緊要事情時，每月亦不過打電話一二次，以一二次之電話，費一個月之話費，經濟的人們，焉忍出此。所以救濟的辦法，最好由電話局辦理公用電話。………』　　據唐君所述，實際上確有此種情形，「借打電話」，在借打之家，話費是不因借打而增加，但話局處理電話業務，因借打之故，自屬加忙；而就另一方面觀察，則業務加忙之結果，收入仍無所增儣。海外電話號稱先進之國家，顧慮及此，早有以電話通話次數，作收費之標凖者，通話次數之記錄，以及預投話費，以得通話，種種方法，各具機械，蓋皆求使用電話者之能得其平，而公用電話設立之處所旣多，借打電話者，亦不期而自絕。我國各大都會，設置公用電話，或者以爲入不敷出，或者以爲流弊頗多，　結所在，殆呸止此。爲社會使用之便利着想，爰爲發行，苟得各抒高見，以相討論，不祗具研究之興味。且亦足供當局之參考也。世界第一個使用電話的中國人  頡民　　美國　金熱時代，有一十六歲之中國兒童，名張廣，遠涉重洋而至美國。後在三藩市開設一店，名曰「廣利」。時正一八七八年，距今五十六年矣。電話之與世相見，爲期僅二年，一切設備，粗具規模，張廣卽能洞燭其便利，在店中裝置電話一具，初不料彼卽爲世界上最最租用電話之華人也。張廣於一九一八年去世，惟其店刻仍由其後人繼續開設，而三藩市之電話簿上，自一八七八年迄今，亦始終載有「廣利」之名云。郵電合作  醒民　　郵電合設一處，是世界各國的通例。我國各地郵政局與電報局，從前雖在同城或同市，而各有局所者，現須合在一處，此舉曾見交部明令，各地已實行者，均有報告，其在進行中者，則因之房屋問題，不難從速解决焉。　　郵政局與電報局同在一處。以郵政與電報，非特同隸一部，卽通信上謀民衆便利，亦具相同之點。或者以爲合併，則郵電同處，營業各分，或者以爲合設，義似較近，蓋各位原來郵局，足留報局辦事之餘地者，或報局房屋寛敝，能讓郵局辦公者，均可遷移其處。此外電報分局得代售郵票收受郵件，而郵局亦得代收電報。雙方互利，用意至佳，革命以來，　　合作：勞費合作，消費亦合作，以此而擬交部推行之辦法，則「郵電合作」四字，鄙意似可代表當局之用意。　　郵局在通信方面，比較能接近多數民衆，與電報局相集一處，當然使電局格外爲民衆所熟識，此舉對於發寄電報者頗多利益；但郵局電匯，得電局之近在咫尺，迅捷龔常，而繁盛各地之郵局，因北　廣闊，且分局又不多者，往往另於商家，設　票代售處，或郵政代辦所，今若電報或電話分局，均可代爲辦理，以相恊助，則寄郵信者所得之便利，又豈淺鮮也哉？歐洲電話天堂—瑞典  陳言鼎　利用電話　方法新奇　　瑞典繁盛城市，均裝有「候話」綫一條，專爲票券代理處，火車站，旅行社，報館，通信社，以及其他話務忙碌之處而設。凡　欲與是項處所通話，面遇話務擁擠不能接通，則是項呼呌卽由「候話」綫接至候話登記室，將號數記錄。一俟綫清，卽予接通。又如欲話務員定時來電呼呌或報告鐘點、則每次費用亦係美金二分半。各項特種電話業務，僅就瑞典京城一處而論，每年在五萬次以上。無怪瑞典有「歐洲電話天堂」之稱。　　最近尚有一極有興味之事，則瑞典京城司多克姆賈爾孫女士與美國密歇根地托羅城克拉生君用横貫大西洋之無綫話結婚是也。緣克拉生君於去年赴瑞遊歷，得與賈爾孫女墕相遇合。七擬卽在瑞典結婚，嗣因突接共在美服務之公司電召返美，以致中輟。現因職務關係，不能赴瑞，如欲在美結婚，則賈爾生女土原籍瑞典，依照美國移民條例，未婚以前、不能來美。雙方乃别闢蹊徑，用無綫電話結婚。結婚之時間，在美國係上午九時，在瑞典則係下午三時。新郎新婦，在用無綫電話傳遞「是」與「願」的語句時，雙方均請當地市府官員，蒞臨證婚，並用留聲機横經大西洋兩面傳奏結婚音樂，以符儀節。但克拉生新夫人方擬起程來美，忽接電報，謂移民局視電話接婚爲不合法律，反對伊來美。但地托羅及斯多克姆兩地市長均認是項結婚手續爲合法，想此事將來終可圓滿解决，亦趣談也。馬可尼軼事（二）  凡　　「馬可尼對於意大利海軍，有很大的貢獻。他和海軍發生關係很早。當他離開祖國到英國去工作之後，因爲意大利有徴兵制，他必須回國服役。但這時候研究無綫電的人很多，他恐怕一失機會，就没有成功希望。於是請倫敦的意大利使館，爲他設法，向海軍部請求免去兵役。後來得到海軍部的回電，要問他在海上有無任務。倫敦方面，爲他想了一個方法說『馬可尼有一漁艇，他自已航行的、此事可由某人作證明』·緣來意大利的海軍部，就免去　的兵役義務，因此馬可尼得在倫敦繼續他的試騐工作。歐戰時候，馬可尼回到祖國服務。此時意皇給他一個陸軍工兵少校的位置。但海軍部以爲馬可尼從前在海軍服役，頗有勞續，所以給了他一個海軍上校的頭銜。在巴黎和會的時候，從海軍部的主張　他做意大利的全權代表」。　　「馬可尼很歡專旅行。歐戰之後，他　了從前屬於奥匣公爵的一只　艇。稱他做Ｅｌｅｔｔｒａｏ他在這只游艇上，做了很多的工作。第一次在一九二零年四月，他從Ｓｄｕｔｈａｍｐｔｏｎ出發，和ＣａｐＦｉｎａ　ｅｒｒｅ及ｅＬｉｓｄｏｎｎｅ做無綫電定向儀的試騐。同時又做倫敦第一播音射程的試騐。一九二二年Ｅｌｅｔｔｒａ到Ｃｓｎｎｅｓ參與萬國無綫電會議。同年又在大西洋作無綫電報及無綫電話的各種試騐。翌年開始他最著名的短波束射試騐。從一九二四年到一九二五年，他又出發，試騐短波的傅遞情形和太陽高度的關係。同年又作無綫電示向儀對於航行利益的各種表演。還有一次，是在一九三零年三月澳洲Ｓｙｄｎｒｙ電氣展覽會開幕時候，他在地中海的那只船上，用無綫電控制展覽會中的開關，使全天大放光明，是最引人注目的。」　　從ＬｒｉｇｉＳｏｌｓｒｉ這本書，我們可以看出馬可尼的一生，是不斷的做，和不斷的想，這就是他的成功要素。値得我們取法的。）完（同居之愛  觀　　電信與郵務，同是交通上重要工具，且亦同屬於交通部管轄之下，實際上相互輔助，不啻唇齒；不過據已入經過之歷史，加以觀察，覺郵務自有其沿革，而電信亦自有其環境，道同而不相爲謀，其原因或在乎此。　　現悉交通部爲便利民衆通信起見，施行郵電合作辦法。所謂合作，並非合併，蓋合併則郵電不分，而合作則仍各自爲政，惟通信業務，比較從前，更能進一步以相恊助，聞蘇浙冀等省三四等電報局，將儘先與郵局聯合共處，可使發寄函電者，一入其門，從心所欲。就内容言，實行合作，就外表言，可稱同居。郵電旣屬同居，則業務與人員方面，愈將聯絡而親切，所以聆及消息，率　「同居之愛」四字，以標此文，非所言情，蓋以昭郵電之能精誠合作也。電報减費新章　　）一（華文電報收報人隆名住址不逾十五字者一律按五字收費　　）二（國内交際電報不分本省隔省華文每字二分洋文每字四分　　）三（郵轉電報不另加收郵資　　（四）鐵路車站經轉電報不另加收鐵路過綫費如有電局不照上開新章收費者，請將報費收據寄至南京交通部澈查。半月消息  社友上海局台實行合併　　交通部所轄各地無線電台，前爲與有綫電局業務上切實聯絡起見，曾奉交通部令凖備合併。現　上海電報局與上海無線電總台首先自本日起實行合併，名稱定爲上海電報局。嗣後除來往公文應逕送福州路電報局外，所有收發電報事務，仍各在原址辦理，惟發寄電報者，不論有綫無綫，兩處均可交發云。修正電報掛號章程　　新訂電報掛號章程對於長期掛號有效期間係自一月一日或七月一日起算至年底或六月底爲止短期掛號自掛號之月一日起算此項辦法原爲便利電局查考期滿掛號而設惟自四月一日起實行後各商行頗多認爲掛號之有效期間不無吃虧者交部現爲顧全商行利益起見業已將該項條文加以作正仍改爲按日計算如四月十六日掛號一年者算至翌年四月十五日期滿同時爲電局檢查掛號便利起見特購置一新式之卡片箱以利業務　云。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言怎樣來處置這難題  雅非　　問題是這樣地擺在面前，展開着，無盡長的展開着；可是更嚴重性了！目前，惡劣緊張的空氣，已緊緊地籠罩住了中日的國際間；甚至，瀰漫及了全世界；激盪着，激盪着，將激起那更不幸的巨潮來，冲散了全世界的字寗！　　但，雖則誰都曉得是一個嚴重的問題，然而吾們又將怎樣來處置這個問題呢！那是一椿很困難的事情。因爲，强硬旣不能，而軟弱却又不可；在日人則軟硬　兼施，在吾國則軟硬不能，這，眞是呌人哭笑不得。　　但是，還灯夢想各國來援助吾們麽？那只須睜眼睛來看看，各國的態度是怎樣的；也是迷離惝恍，不可捉摸！先則曰··一致嚴厲制裁日本之壓迫中國；再則曰··各國對日方之强硬聲明有諒解說。本來，他們的眼紅和妒嫉，原不過是一種酸辛的作用。因爲他們看颼遠東市塲的利益，將都要給日人攫奪去了，所以發起急來：何嘗眞的會來同情中國援助中國。至多也不過是「貓哭老鼠」假慈悲」吧了！　　或是希望國聯來替吾們主張公道嗎？是的，牠是撑握國際間最高權威的一個機關，牠有解决國際糾紛的責任，領導世界和平的使命。可是牠的紙老虎早就給日本人刺破了，牠的責任，牠的使命，都是一些騙人的假面具，只有中國人才僵去上牠的當。只有無聊，末路，才會去拜這位菩薩，這敎訓，在吾們過去的事實，已經很明白的告訴了吾們。　　那麽，吾們終究應當用怎樣一個方法來處置這個嚴重的難題呢？那吾們只有希望當今的賢明政府，抱始終不屈服不讓步的一貫主張；不求别人的帮助，全仗自已來救自已。「寗爲玉碎，母爲瓦全，」决不爲其奸計所逞。事們也不需要這種「逆來順受，委曲求全」的苟安態度。在此國家存亡已在千钧一髮的時候，吾們今日所盼望的是「政府和民衆合作」，合作起來，凖備自救，因爲除了自救的一個辦法之外，也决没有别條出路可走的。　　現在中國的邊土如，安南，台灣，香港，朝鮮，緬甸等，早已脫離了中國的版圖，前車不遠，可以殷鑒。現在列强各國，雖不在努力他們蠶食鯨吞的工作；國人啊！在此危急存亡之秋，吾們再不自救，更待何時！雜感一則  乃　——人是唯物的——　古常時說：「人是唯物的，無論是誰」　　這可是一個眞理，我本來是很同意的。而且我的同意不是附會，盲從。自我稍知運用思想以來，就絕對的相信唯物論，覺得所謂唯心，是　人的迷湯，値不得我們一顧。　　可是我對於古的這兩句說話，却總有些異議。我覺得人固屬是唯物的，但，人到底是人，他是具有特殊的禀賦的，而且人是太流動了，太花樣多了，未能以一個學理來籠套他。所以我的答話總是：　　「人因是唯物的，却有最多的例外！」　　爲了要證明我這話不錯，曾將我好幾個朋友搬上塲來：張三原來是窮困的，我相信他的操守，將來環竟好了，他决不會墮落，决不會爲物慾所蔽；李四是窮困的，我相信他的操守將來生活若有轉圜，也决不會放蕩的。　　古聽了總是搖搖頭說：「靠不住！」新原是一個尶𡯓的人，至於他的操守，連古都很相信，不但是我。最近他的環境稍有進步，每月可以撈得幾十隻小野雞“老洋了，起初我還是很相信他。他原是那麽「克勤克儉」，從前連車子都不常坐，在外面跑，總是靠着兩條腿。不料他自生活稍好後，竟然完且變了，現在聽說他將錢濫用，甚至嫖起堂子來了。爲了這，古常常來進攻我：「人是不是唯物的，你相信了麽？」　　這果使我受窘了，新都受了唯物的支配，這工界，恐怕眞没有誰是不唯物了。　　因爲這足以側證人生的眞義與究竟，所以特把它記述出來。希望新能原諒我！好在人是唯物的，也並不是一句澈底的壞話。何况堂還想給你寫篇小說呢。上海老小像  秋漲小癟三　老鴇　小開　老頭子　老闆　老槍　小拆白悵惘  兆鳳　　一陣輕風，帶來了不少的幽香，氣味，是那麽清幽地，清幽地，吻着我的臉，不，我的心。　　抬起了頭，呵！夜，多麽的靜美，籠罩着那沉死的大地。順着微弱的星芒向遠處望去，瞧，江流，山脈，天宇，郊原，是一片的蒼茫呵！肅穆的，没有一點兒聲息，只浪漫的激盪在冲擊着那岸邊的岩石，奏出了清脆的音律，怪有節拍的，一下，兩下，····。另外，還有那懶散的狗兒，許是被夜的幕布遮掩得有些恐慌？在斷續的應和着低細的音響。　　空宇裏，稍許有點流雲，像棉絮似的潔白，不攙雜一絲房的色彩，襯和着那碧藍得像什麽是的天，彷彿是證清的溪流裏浮着一兩隻白鵝那樣的可愛。敝曠的，一鈎新月，斜吊在天之一角，在慢慢地移動，移動。從屋頂昇到樹梢，影子，疏稀的透進了我的窗扉，投射到凈凈地地面上，輝芒，那極的柔和，呈獻着圖案一面！　　是的，正是桃李盛開的時候，在晚間，從春天裏的秋風帶來了一陣清香，怪膩人的，藴藏着無窮的溫聲的甜味。許是不容易得到的緣故吧？我捨不得離開，因爲這，在我日常生活的遭遇上，是難得有如此的享受的。不禁的，我思索着，這該是前面山坡上吹送過來的。牠一年僅有的一度呵，開了，落了，循環不息地，多可怕喲，人們，面上的靑春不見了，帶來的，是那一條條地皺紋，平舖在眼角，眉上！　　時間，雖則說是在溫和的春夜，但那水門汀砌就的窗抬，究竟是有點冰凉的。那遠處，似乎有一種什麽東西，在吸引着我，不讓我離開牠。這時，在心境裏，没有别的存在，有的，只是空洞和潔白。　　人，畢竟是一個煩惱的生物，空洞和潔白，畢竟也不能長久的保持的。於此，往事在浮蕩着，一幕幕地，像走馬燈一樣，旋轉，閃跳　。　　不用說，往事多半是痛苦的，止不　　住的，那悲傷，憤懣，憂鬱，……同時的向我襲擊着，我苦笑了。的確，人在痛苦的時候，苦笑是一種莫大的安慰。　　抑制着紛亂的心情，從窗抬的旁邊退了回來。外面，悄悄地，樹枝的影子映照在窗帘上，一動了不動，彷彿同情着我的往事，替往呈悲傷。　　一分，一秒，……不停的滑去，夜，更深了，一切，更靜寂得怕人，像死去了的一樣。祗有月華，輕風，花香，流雲，佔據着偉大的空間，散播着自然的柔美；，使人留戀的夜　　　　，使人悵惘的夜喲！　　夜風，吹進來，怪冷的，把窗門關閉了，躺在長短可體的板床上，自忖着——　　——茫茫黑暗，痛楚，環繞着我的前路，這，幾時才能打開了環繞着的一切呢？　　一絲悵惘，又緊啣住了心頭。業餘信箱我要改行　　編者先生：　　近來常常聽見工潮高漲，罷工等等事情。又聽說工人所以要罷工，是因爲工廠裏把工資减削了，是工廠待遇不好。先生，究竟是汪是這樣呢？工人爲什麽要罷工呢？工廠爲什麽要把工資減削呢？　　以上幾個疑問務請你答覆我。因爲我現在在綢緞店裏做學徒，但是學徒的收入是很少的，每月祇有二塊錢，這呌人怎麽　用？聽說作工人還好，每月有十幾塊錢，所以我要改行。但是聽見上述的情形却又不敢了，所以要待你答覆後决定·此頌　　撰安　李家煌敬啓　　答：對於李君的改行問題，編者不能代爲决定，因爲當學徒固然很窮困，做工人又何嘗享福呢。不過關於你所詢的幾個勞働問題，編者郤極感興趣，所以特地們你的信在今天勞働節日發表。勞働問題的性質，編者自慚學淺，不能做一個充分的分柝，但是最近接到一位讀者，來信討論這個問題，他的意見大部分我都同意，現在爲了貪懶和藏拙起見，就把他的來信節錄如下，算我的答覆：　　「ＸＸ　人爲求生存，必需舉行謀生的活動，這種活動就是勞働。但是在</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>人類謀生的本領擴大，每個人勞動的收穫超過於個人的所需時，社會上就不是人人都勞働了，一種人不靠自已勞働爲生，郤依靠着他人的勞働過活，另一種人則以自已的勞働供養人家。在資本主義社會中因爲生產手段與從事勞働者分離，同時生產所有乾又必需大批勞働者來使用生產手段，而無生產手段者又必需以勞働求得生存，於是社會上便產生了一種喪失生產手段而以自已的勞働力作爲商品出賣的勞働者，另一種則爲不從事勞働的生產手段所有者。這樣，社會上便產生了勞働階級。　　「ＸＸ因爲技術的進步，生產規模擴大，工業就成爲生產的重心，於是便發生了下列諸現象：第一，技術漸漸代替人工，工廠漸可少雇勞働者，第二，因爲大規模生產較小規模爲有利，一班小所有者遂不能獨自經營生產，祇得出賣勞働力，於是勞働者人數激增；第三，大量生產的結果，必然的會產生生產過剩現象；第四，農民逐漸流入都市，加增產業預備軍。基於以上幾種原因，勞働者雖一天天增加，而勞働力的需要郤逐漸减少，而因此勞働問題便成了社會上的基礎問題。　　「在我們中國，因爲帝國主義者的經濟侵略，民族工業不能向前發展，而且，就是一些落後的工業，也大都是輕工業，因爲輕工業用小規模製造還不大消費，還可以存在。近幾年來，因外貨如潮一般的侵入，本國工業遂不得不以减輕成本，降低價格，企圖與外貨競爭。减輕成本的最普通辦法，是採用最新的技術設備的减少人工，但因爲輕工業的重心是建築在流動資本身上，所以提高技術設備以减少人工這個辦不进不彀的，它還得另謀出路。它還須一方面减削工資加長工時，另一方面則竭力壓低原料的價格。但這一來，工資率本來低落的我國工人，生活當然是更国困苦了。　　「因爲我們的工業大部分是輕工業，所以不必一定要用强健的男子，工資較低童孺是可以使用的·從我們現在所有的「九省區二十八城市男女童工總人數各業分配表」這一估統計中，這一點是很清楚地指出了。在這個表裏，紡職業工人佔工人全數的百分之四七·實際人數爲五六六·三○一人，其中男工祇一一八·○八○人，婦童工合計却有三七九·三四○人，所以男工疏及童婦工三分之一弱。至於各業工人合計，男工也祇有二七二六二六人，婦童工郤有四二九七二二人。童婦工旣成爲中國工業主力軍，因此，男人失業的廣大，謀業的艱苦，工資的减落，實是必然的現象，蓋無待煩言。　　「另一方面，因爲近幾年來的農村破產，市况蕭條·從農村裏擠出，擁至都市來謀生的窮苦農民，旣日見增加，而各業停工減工等事更不絕發生，失業的人也不斷的膨脹·照上海工部局警務處報告上海僅公共租界一隅，曾經停工之工廠有三十二家，失業工人一萬九千六百三十一人。更據國際貿易局報告，江浙兩省絲廠失業工人當在六十萬以上。我們没有完全的失業統計，但就上面舉的兩個報告看，也可知現在失業問題是如何的嚴重了。工人是靠着勞働生存的，所以失業者愈多謀業競爭也愈激烈，而减削工資，加增工時自然也愈有可能了。　　綜觀以上所說，我們可知現在工人的命運已處於極凄苦悲慘的境界，他們無時無刻不有失業的危險。在這種情况下，工潮不斷地發生，又有什麽奇怪呢？…」編者小說明天（六）  穆琳　　跑了許多地方，他除了在買東西的時候，選精擇肥的講出一大篇道理來，他今天出奇的少開口似乎懷着重大的心事。在路我問全什麽話，都是答非所問，而且也不像平時提防我的行止，有時我我們往往隔離了一段路。　　我很想向他倒义划怎末一回事，話幾次已到嘴邊，見了他不快活的臉色就没有說出來。　　回到家裏，媽早在了。她將買來的東西逐件細察過後，稱贊他辦事能幹，這纔我瞧見了他的笑臉。　　媽到廚房作飯的時候，他猛的握了我的手說：「鶑妹，有一封信在你書桌的抽頭裏。」說罷他戴了帽子就走。我一時像失了知覺，也没有說吃了夜飯去的話。　　在媽不留意的當兒，拿了那封信來，其實媽無論职佑不會注意到這類事上來。那是個折疊得十分爛皺的信封，封口的膠質已走了潮，我偷偷地抽出信箋來，上面寥寥的寫着幾句話：　　鶑妹：　　幾次把寫就的信，因爲没有勇氣授給你而撕了，我覺　得偷偷地愛着一個女子是太痛苦，不過，這似乎又是太冒險的事，請你可憐我罷，我不會是你所想像的那般壞人。　　說出來也羞人，我早料着有這末一回事發生，一個男子在戀愛時候總有一點失常的熊度。不過使我躊躇着的是他明天來的時候怎樣曾泥？我是個將出嫁的女孩子，他是我大姊的丈夫，我想哭，我想告訴媽，你爲什麽出賣了我呢？天啊！　　睡到牀上，將信反覆的看了三次。我好像看出他是那樣痛苦，今晚上他一定也不能好好的安睡。怎樣辦呢？他明天來的時候，我用力踼着被窩，將頭蒙在被中想驅除一切……</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcing the Results of Negotiations with Japan: Upholding the Nine-Power Treaty and Special Rights, Not Recognizing Japan's Unilateral Decision-Making Authority, British International Cooperation Spirit Aids China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, when British Foreign Secretary Simon made a statement in the House of Commons regarding the declaration issued in Tokyo on April 17th, all seats in the House were filled, and the gallery was occupied by prominent diplomats and those concerned with the situation. This demonstrates the great attention paid to the Far Eastern issue by the British people.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary first stated that on April 25th, the British Ambassador to Japan made friendly inquiries to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, informing him that the principle of equal rights in China, as well as the Nine-Power Treaty, were guaranteed in the clearest terms, and that Japan was one of the signatories to this treaty. The British government must continue to enjoy the rights in China shared by all signatory nations, except for rights limited by agreements, such as the Consortium Agreement, or special rights held by Japan that are recognized by other nations. The Japanese side's expressed concerns regarding China are not applicable to Britain. Since British policy aims to avoid endangering China's peace and integrity, the British government cannot recognize Japan's right to unilaterally decide on any special actions, such as technical and financial assistance, that could lead to such dangers.</p>
<p>Simon continued, stating that according to Articles 1 and 7 of the Nine-Power Treaty, Japan has the right to bring to the attention of other signatory nations any actions within China that endanger Japan's security. This right has been guaranteed to Japan, so the British government believes that Japan's declaration is not intended to infringe upon the common rights of other nations in China, or to undermine Japan's own treaty obligations. Now, judging from Foreign Minister Hirota's reply, it can be seen that the British government's assumption is not wrong. Foreign Minister Hirota has assured the British Ambassador that Japan is willing to abide by the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty, and that the policies of the British and Japanese governments are the same. Foreign Minister Hirota concluded by stating that Japan continues to pay close attention to maintaining the Open Door Policy in China.</p>
<p>Simon then replied to questions, stating that Foreign Minister Hirota's statement was still clear, and the British government would stop there. The British government is determined to assist China in moving towards peace and prosperity, and towards progress in Far Eastern harmony and goodwill, to the greatest extent possible and in the spirit of international cooperation.</p>
<p>(Note) Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty states: "Other than China, the contracting parties agree: (1) To respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China; (2) To provide China with the fullest and most unembarrassed opportunity to develop and maintain for itself an effective and stable government; (3). to use their good offices effectively to establish and maintain the principle of equal opportunity for the commerce and industry of all nations throughout the territory of China; (4) to refrain from taking advantage of conditions in China in order to seek special rights or privileges which would abridge the rights of subjects or citizens of friendly States, and from countenancing action inimical to the security of such States."</p>
<p>Article 7 states: "The contracting Powers agree that, whenever there shall arise any situation which, in the opinion of any one of them, involves the application of the stipulations of the present Treaty and renders desirable discussion of such application, there shall be full and frank communication between the contracting Powers concerned."

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the content of Foreign Minister Hirota's meeting with British Ambassador Lindley concerning the Foreign Ministry's declaration on the 17th, Foreign Minister Hirota had originally planned to announce it today. However, due to British Foreign Secretary Simon's simple response in Parliament, and the understanding of the true meaning of the declaration by both the British and American nations after Ambassador Lindley's meeting with the Foreign Minister, Japan will not issue it if there are no unexpected developments, and will temporarily wait and see. (Dentsu telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It was heard today that the Foreign Ministry has decided not to publish the full text of the official declaration submitted to British Ambassador Lindley last Thursday night. A Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that he believed the matter was over. (Reuters telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to respond in Parliament on the 30th to the true meaning of the Japanese government's statement on its China policy. The Japanese Foreign Ministry plans to issue a supplementary statement to clear up British misunderstandings, depending on his response. (Japan United Press telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>(London) The Conservative Party's Daily Mail commented on the Far East issue, stating that Britain should firmly assist any policy regarding the restoration of China's prosperity. If Britain were to contend with Japan because Japan seeks to achieve this goal, it would be akin to madness. Consider Manchuria; formerly a battlefield for warlords, it has become orderly and has great prospects since being managed by Japan. If Japan uses its power to achieve the same result in mainland China, allowing foreign merchants to fully benefit, then its demand for freedom of action in China is not entirely unreasonable.

<p>(London) American diplomat Charles stated that Japanese commercial competition will ultimately lead to a decline in the standard of living worldwide. Charles, representing President Roosevelt in Europe to study improving commercial conditions, stated that he toured and investigated commerce, first in Britain, and came to this conclusion based on his findings in Britain. Charles admitted that he had not yet discovered a method to curb Japanese commercial competition, where low wages and costs are sufficient to endanger British businesses. Charles continued, "A British friend told me that he believes Japan's technical efficiency is also a driving force behind Japanese competition." In his conversation, Charles indicated that investigating Japanese commercial competition was one of the important purposes of his tour of Europe, and he had studied this issue in detail with British experts. It is widely believed that this issue is particularly important at the moment because the Anglo-Japanese textile industry conference has broken down. Charles further indicated that his conversations here have led to discussions on world economic planning. Charles advocated establishing a permanent organization, with two senior commissioners appointed by Britain and the United States, working year-round, spending part of their time on the British side and the other part on the American side, to guide the commercial interests of the two countries and to plan reciprocal tariffs and other agreements. Commissioners from other countries could also adopt the same position. (Kuomintang telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It was announced here today that the bill passed by the Upper House on March 24th to control Japanese imports and exports and to amend tariffs to protect Japanese trade will be implemented from May 1st. The implementation period is three years, and its purpose is to protect Japanese trade and to resist restrictions already imposed or not yet imposed by other countries on Japanese goods. The bill authorizes the government, after consulting with the Tariff Commission and merchants, to restrict or prohibit the import and export of designated goods. In addition to ordinary tariffs, these goods can be subject to new tariffs equal to the price of the goods, and can also be reduced or completely exempted. (Reuters telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Japan's hope that the United States will allow the end of the declaration incident seems dim today. This is according to the Japanese, based on Foreign Minister Hirota's explanation, that the declaration of April 17th is actually the same as the policy previously stated by Foreign Minister and other officials in Tokyo. They hope that this turbulent page in Japanese diplomatic history will come to an end. However, it is stated here that the policy formally announced by Foreign Minister to Congress last time, and the separation of Manchuria from China, and the creation of "Manchukuo" as an accomplished fact, the United States has never accepted it. Some parties are deeply concerned that the State Department has never taken action to abandon the Stimson Doctrine, which is that the United States does not recognize land occupied by force. It is stated here that government officials maintain that the status of "Manchukuo" and the recent declaration issued in Tokyo are all open questions that must ultimately be resolved diplomatically. (Kuomintang telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that Foreign Minister Hirota, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, and Japanese Ambassador to China Arima have met to discuss China policy and have reached complete agreement. The main points are to work slowly and steadily to improve relations between China and Japan. Interference in Sino-Japanese issues by the League of Nations or third countries should be rejected, as Japan has no intention of encroaching on China's independence, and Japan is willing to see China unified. It was also decided that all plans by third parties that seem to obstruct the restoration of normal Sino-Japanese relations should be opposed. The resolution of various disputes between China and Japan should be achieved through direct negotiations between China and Japan. This section applies to the delineation of political, economic and cultural relations between the two countries. (Reuters telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>(London) It is widely rumored in British political circles that Japan intends to begin direct negotiations with China. The Daily Herald states that the Japanese side insists on the following points: recognition of "Manchukuo," recognition of Japan's "special interests" in North China, especially in the Beijing area; China must not raise foreign debt without Japan's consent; China should accept Japan's assistance and cooperation in political and economic reconstruction; and the Chinese army, navy, and air force must not hire foreign advisors other than Japanese.

All parties are paying close attention to Huang Fu's departure and stay. Chu Minyi said that at this time of turmoil in North China, the Peiping Political Council has heavy responsibilities. The central government will not allow Huang to retire. After sincere retention by the government and all parties, Huang agreed to withdraw his resignation and was granted several weeks of leave for rest. He will go north as soon as his leave is over.

<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles say that although Japan has expressed its denial of its presumptuous statements, it is practically impossible to ignore it. Our government is now quietly observing Japan's movements, paying close attention, and temporarily not expressing opinions. As for the external transmission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proceeding to propose the Nine-Power Treaty, there is no such preparation as of now. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the talk of Hiltreich, pointing out that Hiltreich's background is the Englishman Conrad Simpson. The newspaper continued, "British imperialism has coveted the Kashgar region for sixty years. The disintegration of China encourages the hopes of British imperialists. The British in Xinjiang are stirring up disputes to establish their independent Muslim state and detach this great province from China. This dispute is sparked by the joint activities of secret military personnel and the Homburg Business Company." Izvestia pointed out that Reuters' news about the delegation of the people of the new province visiting Hiltreich is just a myth. "This myth depicts the people of Kashgar's desire for independence, and sending a delegation to an unknown city, in an unknown hotel, to visit an unknown king with a Japanese background, requesting his indulgence to ascend the throne. Today we can understand the face of this myth." (TASS telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Pearson, a Far East expert at the American Foreign Policy Association, declared today in his formal report, "If China's territory continues to be invaded, it will be reduced to a small country and be dominated by Japan."

Pearson's report also recalled France's influence in Vietnam and Yunnan and Britain's influence in Tibet. Pearson's report concluded that the trend of partitioning China has continued to grow since 1900 and cannot be compared to any other period. (Kuomintang telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches in recent days, Soviet Russia previously negotiated with the German government on the issue of guaranteeing the security of the Baltic Sea countries, but Germany has refused. Therefore, the security of the Baltic Sea is again at risk. Although this issue is a purely European one and appears to be unrelated to the Far Eastern issue today, a closer examination reveals that it is greatly related to the future situation in the Far East. Germany, in today's Europe, is in a position of being cornered on all sides. It has no other way to go but to raise the banner of anti-communism and develop towards the small countries of the Baltic Sea. Its psychological state is very similar to that of Japan today. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has propagated the idea of preventing the eastward invasion of Red Russia to the international community, as if it is assuming the role of the vanguard against Russia. Then, the international community will surely understand and can sit back and reap the benefits of invading our Northeast. The German Nazi Party cannot forget the countries of the Baltic Sea, which is driven by the same psychology. Germany has learned a lesson from its recent attempt to annex Austria, namely that it understands that countries in the Franco-Italian system have no room for Germany to develop. Therefore, from now on, the only hope can be placed on the Baltic Sea countries. It believes that if it can develop in this direction, it is tantamount to tacitly assuming the role of the vanguard against Russia for the countries of Western Europe, and perhaps it can invite the sympathy of various countries. The error of this kind of psychology will be countered by the facts of other days, so I will not discuss it in detail. However, if Germany does not abandon this kind of psychology, it will hinder Soviet Russia's actions against Japan. Therefore, although it seems irrelevant to the development of the Far Eastern issue, it is actually greatly related.</p>
<p>The reason why Soviet Russia attaches importance to the Baltic Sea countries is that these countries are adjacent to the western part of Soviet Russia, and geographically become the vanguard of Soviet Russia. At the beginning of the establishment of the Soviet Russian government, Britain and France not only blockaded Soviet Russia here, but also used this as a base for attacking the Red Party. Therefore, this area is militarily a must-contend place for Western European countries to use troops against Russia and for Soviet Russia to defend against foreign aggression. Furthermore, observe the non-aggression treaties concluded by Soviet Russia and these countries, all of which stipulate that third countries are not allowed to pass through to attack the two contracting countries. It can be seen that Soviet Russia's intention is to use the Baltic Sea countries as a barrier to other countries' invasion of Russia. However, the national power of the Baltic Sea countries is weak, and they cannot become a strong fortress for Soviet Russia. Because of this, it has still failed to dispel the concerns of the Russians about looking west. The reason why Soviet Russia negotiated with Germany to guarantee the security of this area is probably because of this.</p>
<p>After Germany's annexation of Austria failed, it signed a ten-year non-aggression treaty with Poland. This move seems to be contrary to the Nazi Party's long-cherished wish to restore the territory of the motherland. However, judging from Germany's current position, it is also a last resort. Poland is an ally of France, and its existing strength is far above Germany's. For the Nazi Party's sake, it only has the method of temporarily abandoning its past grievances and pretending to be happy. But its attitude towards the small countries of the Baltic Sea is very different. Not only does it refuse to conclude non-aggression treaties, but it also instigates the Nazi Party to carry out large-scale activities. This is a fact that has been seen in previous newspapers. Until recently, there was a refusal to accept the Soviet Russian proposal to guarantee security. Its intention is to take advantage of the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War to invade these countries by relying on the base of East Prussia. Soviet Russia's proposal this time has fully seen Germany's ambition, so it is making plans in advance to deal with it.</p>
<p>Judging from the current foreign dispatches, although the attitudes of the Baltic Sea countries are all worried about Germany, they also do not want Soviet Russia to come out and plan for them. This is probably afraid of falling into the suspicion of being protected by others and losing the dignity of an independent country. It has a hard heart. However, from our observation, Soviet Russia's action has been in a victorious position diplomatically. On the one hand, Germany's ambition towards the Baltic Sea countries has been fully exposed. Second, the Baltic Sea countries, threatened by the Nazi Party, will form a common front against Germany. Third, in order to prevent the Nazi Party from developing eastward, France and Britain will sooner or later come out and guarantee the neutrality of these small countries. Therefore, Germany's development in this area may fail in the same way as the previous annexation of Austria. It is not yet known. Then, how this issue will affect the Far East in the future can be considered from this.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 30th, attended by Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Daofan, Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Chen Shaokuan, Li Yuanding, Cao Haosen, Chen Ce, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and over 300 staff members from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, President Dai reported on his inspection of the Northwest and his impressions. He stated that his inspection of the Northwest took him through Luoyang, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Xining. Luoyang was peaceful, and the people lived well, with improvements compared to last year, thanks to the efforts of the government and the people. The establishment of a military academy branch will further benefit local security and culture. His impression of Tongguan was also good. The trial run of the western section of the Longhai Railway had reached Huayin, and eight bridge projects had been completed. It is expected that the railway will be open to traffic in Xi'an this year. With the development of railway transportation, the wealth of the people will definitely increase. Domestic industries and bankers are now paying attention to developing Northwest businesses, such as building factories, many of which are in the planning stages. It is believed that these will materialize in the near future. However, the inspection of Chenggong, such as the area around Toudaoyuan and Sandaoyuan, still revealed the tragic situation of "no family without suffering, no land uncultivated." Although this year's harvest was excellent, the severity of past disasters, the death and displacement of people, and the lack of agricultural tools and seeds prevented cultivation. The government, recognizing afforestation as an important task for developing the Northwest, established the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College, centered on Wugong. After more than ten months of preparation and operation, efforts have been made to develop the agricultural fields. Currently, there are two forest farms in Meixian and Zhouzhi. The construction of school buildings will begin soon after the foundation is laid, and enrollment will begin. As for his impression of Lanzhou, in terms of culture, the exquisite architecture, sculpture, and painting are difficult for modern craftsmen to achieve. The skill of Xining's carpentry and brick carving is even more remarkable and should be commended by the central government to avoid being overlooked, as this will promote cultural progress without limits. He felt that this trip was the most satisfying experience of his life, filled with joy and endless hope for the future, and further proved that the central government's policy of developing the frontier areas could be successful with continued efforts.

<p>(Beiping) Men Bingyue returned to Peiping from Suiyuan at 9:30 AM on the 30th. At 3:00 PM, he met with He Yingqin to report on the completion of the reorganization of Sun Dianying's army. According to his report, Yu Shiming's troops have been transported to Henan in six train cars. Lu Fengnian's troops can only move four train cars to Peiping today. Because the Lu and Liu units exceeded their authorized strength by seven to eight thousand, Lu's unit requires ten train cars to complete the transportation. Liu's unit has not yet departed. There are still hundreds of wounded and sick soldiers from Sun's troops in Baotou, who will be transported last. The reorganization is now complete. A total of 230,000 yuan was received for the reorganization expenses, 120,000 yuan was used to disband the officers and soldiers, and 105,000 yuan was used for the food expenses of the Yu, Liu, and Lu brigades. In addition, the excess food for the Lu and Liu soldiers and the shipping costs for the weapons surrendered from Linyun to Baotou exceeded the 230,000 yuan. A total of 12,000 rifles, 20 machine guns and mortars, and 200 artillery pieces have been seized and transported to Suiyuan, where personnel from the branch will be assigned to count them. These can be transported to Peiping today. With all matters completed, He will assign personnel to examine and select a portion of Sun's army's lower-ranking officers to send to military academies in the capital for further training. The bandits led by Yang Hou have completely infiltrated western Chahar and are planning to bypass Mongolia and enter eastern Chahar, joining the puppet army.

<h3 id="e27">Chen Lifu Discusses the Principles of Life in a Report at the Central Memorial Week <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Lifu reported on the principles of life at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 30th. The content was entirely original and insightful. The original text stated that the Premier's teachings included two sentences: "Life is the center of cosmic evolution, and livelihood is the center of human history." The Premier systematically explained this principle: "Livelihood is the center of evolution, and evolution is the center of history, so livelihood is the center of human history." Of the entire Three Principles of the People, the most important is livelihood: "The primary task of construction is livelihood." The development of civil rights and national equality can be said to be auxiliary to solving the livelihood issue, so the Premier decisively made this definition: "Livelihood is the center of human evolution." The materialist conception of history is that the Chinese nation has been able to exist for thousands of years not by chance, but because it has this understanding and generates the power of national self-confidence. What is life? Its equation is as follows: 1. Matter plus spirit equals the body of life; 2. Space plus time equals the use of life; 3. The body of life plus the use of life equals life. Matter and spirit are merely the combination of life elements, with relative dynamic differences. In other words, using the shortest time to occupy the longest space manifests as spirit, and using the longest time to occupy the shortest space manifests as matter. In "Sun Wen's Doctrine," the Premier names all the constituent units of life as life elements, which can be active or static, thus having various organizations and forms. What is visible is matter, and what is invisible is spirit. The two together form the entire body of life. Having the body of life requires understanding the application of time and space. Chairman Chiang often wins battles because he can effectively use his troops, knowing how to use time and space, and having very appropriate deployments. For example, when the Fujian Incident occurred, people were very panicked, but Chairman Chiang had already dispatched troops to the border between Fujian and Zhejiang, occupying the correct space at the correct time, so the Fujian rebellion was quickly suppressed, which is because time and space were used appropriately. Although the 19th Route Army had abundant firearms and combat power, and the body of life was sound, they did not understand the use of life, so they still lost their lives. The body of life plus the use of life constitutes the entirety of life. The "Book of Changes" is a great work that elucidates the principles of life, but it uses different terms from mine, but the principles are the same. The "Book of Changes" says that yin and yang, time and position, yin and yang coordination, each has its own occupation. As for time and space, it is the so-called time and position. Based on this yin and yang time and position, the eight trigrams are derived, and from this, the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred and eighty-four images are derived to infinity. Yin and yang time and position must be coordinated very appropriately. The "Book of Changes" is a large work that specifically studies how to achieve appropriate coordination. The highest ideal of yin and yang coordination is moderation and harmony, where moderation means rationality, and harmony means coordination or balance. The result of moderation and harmony is that it can maintain the survival of all organizations and promote dynamic use, so it is said, "Achieving moderation and harmony, heaven and earth are in their proper positions, and all things flourish." The highest ideal of spatial occupation is uprightness, which is the appropriate position. Without uprightness, there is no movement; excessive uprightness is biased. Excess and deficiency are not appropriate, so it must be upright. The highest ideal of temporal control is the golden mean, which is a rational long life. The mean is the use of the center, not deviating is called the center, not changing is called the mean. Not deviating and not changing means rational and unchanging. Sustaining and using appropriate time is called the golden mean. The purpose of moderation and harmony is eugenics, which is good survival. The purpose of uprightness is universal life, which is the hope that everyone can have a fair life. The purpose of the golden mean is longevity. The Chinese nation invented yin and yang time and position, and further invented the principles of "moderation and harmony," "uprightness," and "the golden mean," and must strive for "rational harmony," "rational uprightness," and "rational use." Therefore, "the center" is like a pivot, and "harmony," "uprightness," and "the golden mean" are three different mechanisms connected to the "center." Zhuangzi's "Discussion on the Equality of Things" says, "The pivot begins to attain its central position to respond to infinity," which is truly a great invention in Chinese philosophy. In short, the harmony issued from the center is for the purpose of eugenics, the uprightness issued from the center is for the purpose of universal life, and the golden mean issued from the center is for the purpose of longevity. Thus, harmony, uprightness, and the golden mean can be said to be "one in essence with the center as the basis and life as the use." China has had many sages and revolutionaries who have elaborated on the principles of life so thoroughly, so why is it still not strong and superior? It is because the majority of intellectuals today, in the trend of revolutionary destruction, have thrown all these principles into the wastepaper basket, always thinking that their own things are bad and foreign things are good. They do not know that Western civilization is also heading down the wrong path. If we fully understand the Three Principles of the People, we will surely believe that communism, capitalism, and fascism are not as great as the Three Principles of the People, because its benefits are all included in the Three Principles of the People. Only the Three Principles of the People can construct the entirety of life and achieve great overall use. We must understand the principle of "knowing is difficult, acting is easy," striving to learn what is unknown and quickly implementing what is known, which is the construction of psychology and spirit. At the same time, how to supplement and create various materials for clothing, food, housing, and transportation is the construction of matter. Once special qualities are abundant and spirit is prepared, the entire body of life is naturally sound. Dr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to restore the inherent morality, intelligence, creativity, and organizational power of the Chinese nation, and at the same time catch up with Western civilization to supplement the lack of material conditions, so he also told us that revolution cannot simply copy the achievements of others. I have my own historical background (time), special environment (space), and methods. Forgetting the relationship between time and space simply cannot be a revolution, let alone talk about the use of life, so he said, "We must continue to work hard in accordance with my 'National Reconstruction Outline,' 'National Reconstruction Program,' 'Three Principles of the People,' and the 'Declaration of the First National Congress' to achieve thorough implementation." Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a physician who used the principles of treating people to treat the country, the nation, and the world, seeking eugenics, universal life, and longevity, so he was also a physiologist, and what he applied was entirely "the principles of life." The greatness of the Three Principles of the People is truly profound and infinite, and one must undergo deep experience and constant research to understand even a fraction of its meaning. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek initiated the New Life Movement because he saw this point of the principles of life, such as the virtues of etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and shame, to meet the needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, which are all called upon by nationalism for us to implement, to enrich the spirit and material conditions of the nation. The Chinese nation has already had so many great discoveries in the past, and if it further promotes its light, it will surely become a nation of longevity and eugenics, and it will also seek universal life, that is, to seek longevity and eugenics for all mankind, which is called the Great Harmony. In recent years, the active progress of the national revolution has given the precarious nation a great opportunity for life. In the future, it should further develop its construction capabilities based on the principles of life, on the one hand, restoring the inherent intelligence of our country and rescuing the former culture from its roots, and on the other hand, catching up with Western material civilization, so that the revolutionary cause can be completed. Since we have assumed this responsibility, we cannot but have a deep understanding of the principles of life (Central News Agency, 30th).</p>

<h3 id="e30">Ministry of Finance Recovers Securities from Shanghai Banking Consortium <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 30th. He stated that the issue of the Ministry of Finance recovering the 30 million yuan in securities issued by the Sino-Italian Indemnity Loan Group, which was organized by 16 banks including the Central Bank of Shanghai, has been finalized after negotiations between the former Director Zheng Lai and the banking sector. After the Ministry of Finance recovers the securities, it will still use the 30 million yuan in Sino-Italian Indemnity as a reserve fund to issue treasury bills to repay a portion of the 44 million yuan in debt. Before the banks sell them, they can be used as bank reserves, but they will not circulate in the trading market. The methods and interest rates are still in accordance with the methods agreed upon before January 27. As for the losses suffered by the banking consortium, the amount is not large, and the Ministry of Finance has agreed to reimburse them. The procedures for issuing treasury bills are currently being prepared and negotiated and should be realized soon. As for my trip to Shanghai this time, it was not to negotiate this matter, as all procedures are still being negotiated with the banking consortium by Zheng Lai. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously borrowed 30 million yuan from Shanghai Central and other banks using the Sino-Italian Indemnity as collateral. Both parties signed a contract. Yesterday's report stated that the Ministry of Finance would recover it and issue public bonds, and that Jiang Lufu, Director of the Public Debt Department, and others had been sent to Shanghai to negotiate the issuance methods with the banking sector. According to the person in charge of the Ministry, he denied the matter to reporters, because the Ministry's issuance of public bonds must be approved by the central government and go through legislative procedures before it can be handled. Furthermore, Jiang Lufu returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 30th and also said that the claim that the Ministry of Finance would issue the bonds was not accurate. (Central News Agency, 30th)</p>

The telegram stated that they had followed the instructions and officially established the committee at Bailingmiao on the 23rd of this month, under the supervision of the central government's special envoy and guiding officer representative, Committee Member He Jingwu. The chairman and members were sworn in at the same time. They said that Mongolia is located on the frontier, neighboring strong powers that are watching it covetously, with crises lurking on all sides, which is worrying. In addition, the transportation is inconvenient, the people's sentiments are closed off, and culture and economy are backward. They are bearing this heavy responsibility at this difficult time, with limited talent and virtue, and are prone to missteps. However, since they have undertaken the heavy trust of the central government and the sincere hopes of the Mongolian people, they can only respectfully follow the Premier's teachings and, under the guidance of the central government, carry out matters that should be promoted and reformed locally, and plan and implement them according to the autonomous implementation plan, in order to consolidate the border and live up to the great mandate. The telegram ended with expressions of utmost trepidation. (Central News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Legislative Committee Member Lou Tongsun, who is familiar with the international situation, was summoned to the official residence by President Wang a few days ago for consultation. This morning, he told reporters that the national morale is currently depressed. If Japan's oppression of us becomes even more severe, the deeper the stimulation, the greater the resistance. Therefore, to escape from death, we can only hope that the enemy will increase pressure on us. According to my observation, China will definitely not perish in the short term, because the national border is too large. No matter what, Japan cannot swallow it in one bite. Currently, Japan is indeed the world's demon king, challenging all countries. Former British Ambassador to China Lampson told me that European politics always has a certain pattern: there was the disturbance of Napoleon in 1814, the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and then the European War in 1914. Therefore, there must be a war every 40 to 50 years. Only 20 years have passed since the European War, and the war debts of various countries have not yet been repaid, so I dare to assert that the Second World War will occur at least 20 to 30 years later. Britain and the United States will not go to war with Japan in the short term. Even if they unfortunately go to war, it will be like the Russo-Japanese War, and Britain and the United States will remain silent for the time being. People are worried about the coming of the Second World War, but in fact, they are all nervous. In short, I advocate actively resisting Japan, so that its aggression becomes even more severe, which can stimulate national morale, truly defend against insults, and forge a path to survival.

At the same time, it has been reported that merchants in Vienna who lease royal property have now been notified to move out by August 1, because various departments of the cabinet will need the houses. It is believed here that if this news is true, the return of Archduke Otto may promote the unity of Austria and leave a glimmer of hope for the country. (29th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e59">India's Northwest Frontier: Crowds Gather at Police Station, Bricks and Stones Fly, Injuring Three Police Officers <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Peshawar. Today in Peshawar, the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province of India, a group of Muslims from the Masakzai tribe came to the city for a meeting of elders chaired by the provincial governor. One of them was arrested for robbery and taken to a nearby police station, leading to a crowd gathering outside the station, angrily scolding the police inside and demanding the release of those arrested. The crowd grew larger and larger, and their momentum was fierce. The police prepared to deal with the situation. Before long, one of the protesters picked up a stone and smashed a window of the station. Thereupon, the crowd followed suit, and bricks and stones flew, seriously injuring three police officers. The police initially responded with patience, but fearing that the police station would be occupied, they opened fire to defend themselves. One person in the crowd was shot in the arm and fell to the ground in pain. The crowd initially retreated slightly, but then the attack became more fierce until the eighth shot was fired, at which point the crowd retreated slightly. At this time, reinforcements from other police stations also arrived and dispersed the crowd with batons. (30th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Shift in French Mentality: Indicated by Mantes Election <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The failure of former MP Pescheux, who resigned from the French Mantes constituency, to win the election yesterday caused disturbances, as reported in previous telegrams. Local police, fearing that they were too weak to maintain order, continued to request reinforcements from Versailles and Paris. At 2:00 AM this morning, two trucks from the Paris Police Department, filled with police officers, arrived here, but did not interfere. At the same time, Pomaret Vaucresson, Prefect of the Yvelines Department, also led six companies of militia. The local police were then able to withdraw. As a result of the disturbances, some demonstrators were injured, and about twenty police officers were injured. Police officer Daumert was injured in the neck in two places. The windows of the Mantes Daily newspaper were smashed, and the facade of a hotel was also severely damaged. By 2:00 AM, order was restored, and the military police were able to withdraw, leaving only a few police officers patrolling to prevent accidents. (30th, Havas dispatch) (Paris) This morning, the newspapers all commented on the results of the Mantes election. The independent Le Temps said that the electorate had expelled a destroyer (referring to Pescheux) from the Chamber of Deputies, which was no different from the people's desire to eliminate the Trotskyist troublemakers. Le Journal said that there has indeed been a shift in the French mentality, as can be seen from the results of the Mantes election. L'Ère Nouvelle, the organ of the Radical Socialist Party, believes that Pescheux's losses did not exceed two hundred votes, and his political enemies should not consider it a victory. Le Populaire, the organ of the Socialist Party, believes that if the government regards the results of the Mantes election as an expression of popular support for the current government, then it should not hesitate to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and seek new public opinion.

<h3 id="e61">American Armed Robbers: More Numerous than its Army and Navy <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Attorney General Cummings made startling remarks to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that American bandit gangs have more armed members than the American army and navy. Cummings advocated legislation authorizing the central government to crack down on the activities of criminals, because the punishment of criminals is currently handled by the state authorities themselves. After robbing a bank, bandits can cross state lines and temporarily remain at large. Cummings also described the nature of the various bandit gangs, saying that the Touhy Gang is known for torture, while the Capone Gang, now led by Humfreys, is not so cruel and does not engage in acts such as cutting off ears and gouging out eyes. One of the proposals currently being considered by the Judiciary Committee advocates that anyone who crosses state lines to evade arrest should be considered a criminal. Another proposal advocates that anyone who robs a Federal Reserve Bank or a national bank should be prosecuted as a federal crime. Previously, such cases were only regarded as local state cases. The central government has also proposed that the central government should handle cases of killing central government personnel itself. There is also a bill that advocates that anyone who possesses firearms must provide fingerprints. The Judiciary Committee felt that this method was too severe, so it suggested that only those who possess machine guns should be required to provide fingerprints. However, Attorney General Cummings advocated strict enforcement, because fast-firing pistols are also the most dangerous weapons. (29th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Rubber Agreement Established: Adjusting Production and Exports <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(London) A rubber restriction agreement was established today. All organized plantations in various places have joined the agreement. The restriction plan will take effect on June 1, 1934, and end on December 31, 1938. The agreement adjusts rubber production and exports to reduce existing world stocks and maintain fair prices so that producers can obtain considerable benefits. Rubber planting is not allowed to expand, except for experimental purposes. Even for experimental purposes, it is limited to 25% of the existing rubber area. Rubber replanting is limited to 20% of the existing rubber area per household. The tools for planting rubber in the areas within this agreement may not be transported to other places to prevent rubber from being planted elsewhere. Over the past three years, the average price of first-class rubber has been 3 pence 65 per pound. This is an uneconomical price, which not only affects producers, but also disrupts the supply needed by consumers. The quotas stipulated in this rubber agreement are stipulated according to the potential production capacity of the main producing regions. The quota for 1934 is 1,019,000 tons. In 1933, the raw rubber produced in various places not within this restriction plan was only 12,970 tons. Representatives of the London and Eastern Rubber Committee unanimously supported the principle of the rubber plan. Most people in the rubber industry acknowledge that the price limit is too high and may not be a blessing for the industry. The following is a list of countries which the rubber agreement applies to with the number of tons to be exported in the next five years:</p>
<p>|                   | 1934     | 1935     | 1936     | 1937     | 1938     |</p>
<p>|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|</p>
<p>| Malaya            | 504,000  | 538,000  | 569,000  | 589,000  | 602,000  |</p>
<p>| Dutch East Indies | 352,000  | 400,000  | 443,000  | 467,000  | 485,000  |</p>
<p>| Ceylon            | 77,000   | 79,000   | 80,000   | 81,000   | 82,500   |</p>
<p>| North Borneo      | 12,000   | 13,000   | 14,000   | 15,500   | 16,500   |</p>
<p>| Sarawak           | 24,000   | 28,000   | 30,000   | 31,500   | 32,000   |</p>
<p>| Siam              | 15,000   | 15,000   | 5,000   | 15,000   | 15,000   |</p>
<p>| India             | 6,850    | 8,250    | 9,000    | 9,000    | 9,250    |</p>
<p>| Burma             | 5,150    | 6,750    | 8,000    | 9,000    | 9,250    |</p>
<p>The governments signing this agreement will appoint representatives to form an International Rubber Management Committee. Quotas of one thousand tons or more have one right. The number of rights of each delegation is extrapolated accordingly. The main function of this committee is to determine the percentage of quotas that can be exported at any time. In this regard, the committee will solicit the opinions of manufacturers in Europe and the United States. During this management period, Siam is allowed to plant rubber up to 31,000 acres, and its export quota is based on the number stipulated annually. France purchased about four times as much rubber in 1933 as Vietnam exported, so there are separate regulations regarding the number of rubber that Vietnam can export. In this agreement, governments other than Sarawak and Siam will levy a surtax on rubber exports, with the revenue being transferred to research funding. Although this agreement is scheduled to take effect on June 1 of this year and end on December 31, 1938, the International Rubber Management Committee may suggest its continuation or abolition in advance. This agreement has been submitted to the governments of all related countries for legislation and asks producers and merchants to store inventory not exceeding the percentage required for their transactions.

<p>(London) Newspapers have expressed a good impression of the rubber restriction plan. According to the Financial Times, this seems to be a bright and sound plan that can give the rubber industry great hope for recovery. There is now an important point that needs to be clarified, that is, how much the export quota is. However, this plan does not involve the issue of native planting in the Dutch East Indies. Presumably, the Dutch authorities there must be confident in their ability to carry out unfinished matters and regard it as the work of internal administration. The newspaper predicts that the price of raw rubber will gradually rise steadily thereafter, but will not rise sharply. Also, a senior official of the rubber exchange told a Morning Post reporter that he believes that the restriction plan now in place is very satisfactory and easy to implement. He thinks that the governments of all related parties will be able to give their informal consent, so there is no reason to say that the plan cannot be implemented on June 1. The official also said that a certain price may not be stipulated now, and the price he hopes for may not be less than 9 pence per pound, but this price cannot be reached in a short time. As for the important issue of shipping restrictions, it has not yet been addressed. (29th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British Colonial Secretary Lister said in the Lower House today that the government has received a petition from the Rubber Planters' Association requesting that the rubber restriction agreement be implemented in British Imperial colonies. After consulting with the colonial governments, the British government has decided to take the necessary measures for this matter, but it requires other related governments to take similar action. As far as British territories are concerned, he hopes that this plan can be implemented from June 1, and he hopes that other countries can do the same, because prompt action is very important. Those who are very familiar with the rubber industry recognize that this agreement is quite stable, can be implemented administratively in all aspects, and is suitable for the interests of the rubber industry.

<p>The measures that the Dutch East Indies government in The Hague intends to submit to Parliament are related to the quotas of local and European rubber plantations. According to recent news, the authorities intend to issue individual licenses to plantations and restrict the export of native rubber by a progressive rate of export tax. (30th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) People in the rubber industry are very welcoming of the new production management plan. At the beginning of rubber market opening this morning, most people were discussing the relationship of this plan. Before long, the market price rose. Although there was profit-taking, the rising trend did not diminish slightly. The midday price was 375 higher than yesterday's closing price. Although the plan did not contain detailed rules on how to restrict native production in the Dutch East Indies, people believe that the Dutch East Indies government is now ready with detailed measures. The quotas have not been announced, but this has not caused concern. Currently, morale is high, and it is believed that all governments have acted in unison, which can make the future of the rubber industry more stable. People in the market are now speculating that prices may soon reach about 7 pence per pound. (30th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague. The officialdom announced that the Dutch East Indies government will submit a bill to Parliament within a few days to implement the rubber management plan. (30th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>New York Silver (30th): The New York silver market is more stable due to buying despite selling in London. The London price is 70 basis points higher than New York. May futures were slightly liquidated, and the market weakened again due to continued liquidation by speculators and the lack of encouraging news from Washington.

<h3 id="e96">Cotton and Wheat <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>US Cotton (30th): The cotton market opened sluggishly with merchants taking a wait-and-see approach. The unfavorable atmosphere surrounding the silver legislation bill and the weak silver price deterred buying. However, buying of forward contracts from Europe and buying by retail investors and industry players absorbed local and Southern selling, so sentiment turned bullish.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton (30th): The Bombay cotton market fell due to profit-taking and some selling by European exporters. The price of Beloqi cotton for July/August delivery is 186 rupees 75, down 3 rupees 25.</p>

<p>New York (30th): News of rubber restrictions was released last night, so the rubber market was quite active. There was a lot of buying and selling when prices rose by about one cent. New buying was offset by profit-taking. Although merchants are unwilling to express their opinions quickly because they have not seen the details of the restrictions, the general public is very welcome to the restriction plan. Or the world may not be able to consume the proposed quota. The most encouraging thing is that no new trees have been planted in the past five years. The public expects the market to be active and strong. Some brokers predict that prices will rise by two cents, but others say that there will be a lot of profit-taking when prices rise.</p>

<p>Communist Main Force Assembles at Yanxie Yue, Huichang</p>
<p>Li Mingrui's Bandit Gang Raids Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Although Yunmenling has been recovered by the Southern Route Army, there are still bandit gangs in the Huichang area who are relying on strong fortifications to resist stubbornly. Yesterday, a special aircraft was dispatched to bomb them to clear the obstacles for the infantry's long-drive advance. After receiving the order, the aircraft squadron has been dispatching aircraft carrying heavy bombs to bomb the Huichang area for days. The bandit stronghold in Haifeng Lake has been destroyed. A telegram reported yesterday, "(Title omitted) Since Yunmenling was recovered on the 21st, our troops have been dispatching aircraft for reconnaissance for days. According to the report from team member Xu on the 22nd, the main force of the Jiangxi bandits is concentrated at Yanxie Yue, Huichang, and is building bandit strongholds very quickly. The number of remaining bandits is about 10,000. At the same time, a telegram was received from Commander Li (Yangjing) ordering the dispatch of four aircraft to distribute a declaration to transform the Red bandits 50 miles away from Huichang in Feng Nie Shi. As soon as they reached Fengji, they were shot back at Haifeng Lake by a fake Gao battalion. Additional aircraft were immediately added to bomb from the air, dropping five bombs, destroying all the newly built bandit bunkers. The people in the bandit area were frightened and fled for their lives. The puppet army fled eastward, where they were intercepted by the 8th Division Xie's Regiment, which captured four anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>While the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi were being defeated, the Communist bandits in southern Hunan, in order to contain the Southern Route Army, sent a gang of about 200-300 Communist bandits led by Li Jiabao to raid Pingshi in northern Guangdong on the 16th of this month. It is reported that Li Jiabao's bandits are actually Li Mingrui's gang. Li's bandits roamed eastern Hunan and western Jiangxi years ago. After being severely suppressed by the Guangdong and Hunan armies, the remnants fled to the mountains at the junction of Yizhang and Lian County, possessing more than 2,000 bandits. On the 16th, a gang was sent to raid Lechang. The Lian County defense army rushed to Xingzi to intercept them. The Li bandits, knowing that they would not succeed, fled back to southern Hunan on the 18th. On the 19th and 20th, they were severely suppressed head-on by the Hunan army. Most of Li Mingrui's two gangs broke through, with one part fleeing into Baizhi Mountain and one part retreating into Wuzhao Mountain, which belongs to Yizhang. Currently, the Hunan and Guangdong armies are dispatching teams to cooperate in the search. (April 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Bloody Battle Before Guangchang's Recovery: Peng Dehuai Leads Fake 13th Army Corps in Fierce Attack, National Army Persists for Four Days and Nights, Defeating Main Force of Bandits <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Nanfeng Correspondence: After the Third Route Army achieved a great victory in the battle of Baishe Sanxi Xu, it actively constructed blockhouses and highways, advancing towards Guangchang step by step. From Baishe to Ganzhu, every battle was won. Therefore, the bandits also gathered everything they had, densely deploying on the southern Guangxi border area, in an attempt to make a last-ditch struggle. On April 19, the Bandit Suppression Army Fan Column advanced from Hucen within Nanfeng to attack the bandits near Yanfu Zhang and Daluo Mountain. The bandits' fake sixth division stubbornly resisted, relying on their villages. After the Bandit Suppression Army's fierce attack, they occupied the bandit bunkers in each of those locations and advanced to Guotiekeng. Most of the bandits counterattacked Daluo Mountain. The fierce battle continued throughout the night, and at dawn on the 20th, the Bandit Suppression Army counterattacked with a portion of their forces, displaying unparalleled bravery. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled southeast. In this battle, the bandits repeatedly charged but were repelled by the Bandit Suppression Army, resulting in extraordinarily heavy casualties on the bandit side. Dozens of puppet regimental commanders and battalion commanders and above were killed, and over a thousand bodies were left in front of the positions. Countless were captured. Furthermore, near Raojiapu, which belongs to Guangchang County, they made contact with the bandits. Peng Dehuai personally led the fake 13th Army Corps in a fierce assault on the Bandit Suppression Army's positions with dense formations. The fierce battle continued throughout the night. The bandits attempted to use their tricks, shouting strange sounds and charging repeatedly, but the Bandit Suppression Army calmly responded. Although the bandits were fierce, they ultimately failed after several hand-to-hand combats. In this battle, the Bandit Suppression Army killed over a thousand more bandits and captured countless. By the morning of the 21st, the Bandit Suppression Army took advantage of their victory to pursue, advancing along the west bank of the river. Although the fake Ninth Army Corps resisted step by step, it was eventually defeated. Zhang Jiwu, the division commander of the fake 14th Division, was killed on the spot by the Bandit Suppression Army. As a result, at noon on the same day, they occupied the high ground near Chongsheng Bridge, more than ten miles away from Guangchang, and the area to the west. Another part of the Bandit Suppression Army also crossed the river on the same day, advancing along the east bank of the river and breaking through the bandits' strong bunkers. It was reported that at noon, they occupied the high ground in the area of Chiba Mountain and Kuzhukeng, east of Chongsheng Bridge. Although the remnants of the 13th Division of the fake Fifth Army Corps and the fake Sixth Division stubbornly resisted, relying on the high ground, they were also bravely repelled by the Bandit Suppression Army. It was followed on the 22nd at noon occupying Gaozhou, and its southwest Xianglu Peak and other highlands totaling from the 19th to the 22nd, fierce fighting lasting four days and nights, the fierce and long-lasting fighting is only seen in the real, and finally the main force of the bandits in Guangchang was completely resolved, the Bandit Suppression Army each sector, is now actively constructing roads and bunkers, Guangchang county and the shadow have been in sight, recovery will be soon.

<h3 id="e107">Amoy Two Assassination Cases: The Deceased Were an Old Man and a Young Man, Both Hands Bound Backwards; Residents Heard Three Gunshots, Circumstances Bizarre <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>An Amoy dispatch: On the morning of the 25th, an assassination occurred at Ben Zhu Building on Narcissus Road. The deceased were an old man and a young man, names unknown. As of the evening of the 26th, no one had yet identified the bodies. The hands of both deceased were bound backwards. It appeared that the perpetrators numbered more than one, and the circumstances of the case were quite bizarre. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Wooden Pillar Building on Narcissus Road is a small alley in the Sixth Market, with several diverging paths. It borders the rocky stone wall at the rear of the Sixth Market, which is unusually steep. Around 2 AM on the morning of the 25th, it was dark and raining heavily when residents nearby suddenly heard three gunshots. Around 3 AM, a carpenter named An Zhang, residing at No. 21 Wooden Pillar Building, got up early for work. His wife opened the door to draw water and saw a person lying on the ground in the lamplight. Upon closer inspection, the person's face was covered in blood; it was a corpse. She screamed in terror, alarming the neighbors. Officer Dai Fu Xian of the Third Precinct happened to be on patrol and arrived at the scene. As he was investigating, he suddenly saw another corpse on a pile of earth below the stone wall. Around 4 AM, officers from the Third Precinct and the Detective Division of the Public Security Bureau arrived. Upon inspection of the deceased, both had their hands bound backwards and were lying in pools of blood. One, lying supine in the alley of the Wooden Pillar Building, was about forty years old, dressed in a black serge Chinese-style short jacket, with a yellow wool sweater underneath, gray serge Western-style trousers, and brown leather shoes. A yellow felt hat lay beside him. He had a gunshot wound to the back of his head; the bullet had not exited, and brain matter was flowing out. He had a gunshot wound directly in the center of his chest; the bullet had also not exited. It appeared to be from a revolver. On the right side of his face, from forehead to cheek, were five knife wounds. The younger man, about twenty years old, lay on the pile of earth, wearing a black overcoat, a white cloth undershirt, black Fuji silk trousers, and was barefoot, without socks. A pair of brown, low-cut leather shoes lay beside him. He had a gunshot wound to the head; the bullet entered the left cheekbone and exited the right. It also appeared to be from a revolver. He had no knife wounds. Both men had blood-soaked faces and lay in pools of blood, mixed with mud. Their hair was disheveled and the scene was quite frightening. Detectives searched the two men and found nothing on them besides their clothing. Not even a business card or a scrap of paper. It appeared that they had been searched first, in an attempt to destroy evidence. However, inside the older man's Western-style trousers, the word "Tang" and "Yin Li La" were written in black ink. From this, it was speculated that he may be a Chinese expatriate from the Philippines. Two used bullet casings and three bullets were found on the ground nearby. The rope used to bind the deceased's hands backwards was white, thick as chopsticks, and extremely sturdy, not something found in ordinary shops. The knots used to bind their hands backwards were slipknots, pulled tight, showing great skill. It appeared they were bound, driven to the location, shot, and their bodies abandoned by the roadside. From this, it was speculated that the killers were not alone. It was reported that a woman from Fuzhou living nearby heard someone order her to stop at the entrance of the Wooden Pillar Building alley when she went out to buy food around 2 AM. The person said it was under curfew, so she did not dare pass. She had only walked a few steps away when she heard three gunshots. The clues obtained ended there. After the incident occurred, it caused a sensation in Amoy. From morning until night, no fewer than ten thousand people came to observe, but no one had yet identified the bodies. In the evening, the Public Security Bureau moved the bodies to the autopsy site and posted a notice stating, "According to a report from the Third Precinct, around 3 AM last night, two male corpses were found murdered in the Wooden Pillar Building area, one over forty years old and one over twenty years old. The names of the victims are unknown. In addition to ordering a thorough investigation to apprehend the murderers, photographs have been taken to allow for identification. If anyone recognizes the names and addresses of the victims, please report to the precinct or detective division as soon as possible, so they can be brought in for identification," etc. However, as of the evening of the 26th, no one had claimed the bodies. Thus, this headless case currently has no leads. The Japanese consulate sent personnel to the scene to take photographs, but the deceased were not Taiwanese. The Detective Division is currently conducting a thorough investigation. Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Gu Pan has given a three-day deadline to solve the case. (April 27th)</p>

<p>Yesterday (April 30th) at 2 PM, the County River Dredging Committee held its second general meeting. The attending committee members included Jin Ti Gan, Cai Zhong Yu, Li Zu Fu, Li Zu Hua, Xu Mo Jia, Shen Lian Bi, Wang Zhe Wu, Zhu Jiu Wang, Zhang Ji Liang, Zhang Huan Zhi, Ni Bing Ruo, Zhu Yi An, Wu Bo Geng, Xu Chun Pu, Chen Gui San, Zhou Ding, Zhu Zhao Sheng, Yang Zhi Min, Yang Yun Sheng, Yu Kui Sun, Zhao Song Quan, Wu Ju Chi, Liao Yun Qing, and Lu Kan Sheng, twenty-four persons in total. Before the meeting began, citizens Yao Song Xian, Tang Zhi Gao, Sun Hu Zhan, Wu Cun Fu, Yu Zhong Chi, Wu Bo Yang, Cheng Li Huan, Zhang Cheng, Lei Jun Yan, Zhang Wan Zhi, Zhu Jing Lu, Liu Wen Fan, Yang Cheng Xin, Xie Yu Cang, and others successively arrived to petition, raising four points: 1. Review old cases and reduce inflated expenditures to improve river works. 2. Cancel contracts and employ local workers to benefit the laborers. 3. Be cautious with public funds and eliminate excessive taxes to alleviate burdens. 4. Make project expenditures fully transparent to demonstrate integrity, requesting their adoption. The meeting then began, chaired by County Magistrate Jin. After briefly describing the progress of the river works, the citizen representatives reported on the arbitrary disturbances caused by workers from out of town, and the damage to the dam built at the Jishui confluence on Kuatang Bridge. They requested the expulsion of the migrant workers and the cancellation of the contract for further discussion. They also pointed out that due to the continuous rainfall in recent days, the deadline was approaching. According to the contract, the work must be completed in one hundred days. Counting from the start date of the seventh day of the third lunar month, even if there is no more rain, it would not be completed until the seventeenth day of the sixth lunar month. If there is much more rain, the completion would have to be after autumn. Considering the seasonal aspect, it would require further consideration. After serious discussion at the meeting, it was decided that after the completion of the first section of the main river that is currently under construction (i.e., the section from Huayang Bridge to the East Gate), the other sections would be temporarily suspended and dredged during the agricultural off-season in autumn. The termination of the contract with the Taichang Gravel Company and the resignation of the auditing division, river works that had been brewing for months, were thus terminated due to factual impossibilities.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Further Interrogation in the Case of the Major Bandit Yang Meimei <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Yang Meimei and two other remnants of Tai Bao Ah Shu's gang were captured in Fengjing by Officer Fei Gongxia of the Water Patrol. They were handed over to the county yesterday. Yang Meimei said she was twenty-nine years old, from Luxiang, Jinshan. She studied under Zhu Luo Ah Mei and followed him in robberies in Xinzha, Zhejiang. Because Lu Xiang Public Security Bureau Chief arrested Yang Ah Qin, she was angered and killed the bureau chief. Her master was executed. She escaped to Taihu Lake and was repeatedly pursued and captured by government troops. She then fled to Shanghai and worked as a waiter somewhere. At the Xianshi roof garden, she met Xu Lao Wu, who mentioned going out to do a job. A two-year-old child hostage was tied up in Xiaozheng, and the remaining ransom was overdue, so she and eight men sent by Xu Lao Wu took the intercity train to Fengjing. In the dark rain, she asked questions in Ni Gu Alley and was spotted by Lord Guan, eager to escape but unable. She was captured. She had committed many crimes. After sixteen years, she was still a young woman. Lord Guan could be promoted. One criminal was named Guo Jiasheng, from Xuzhou; the other was named Zhang Jinsheng, also known as Chen Shenghong, from Anhui. They intended to go to Xiaozheng to collect the ransom and then go to Yaozhuang Bridge to rob Yaojia Village. Among the fugitives was a female bandit who had a handgun and eighteen bullets hidden on her person. The firearms confessed to by Bandit Yang were found yesterday in Xiaozheng, but they had been marked. Bandit Yang suffered from an opium addiction and claimed that he needed three yuan a day while in Shanghai, requesting that the team provide it, which was denied. Therefore, he was tired today. When meeting reporters, he talked frankly about his experiences. He was truly fearless of the law.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Three Records of Students Withdrawing from the Third Grade of Provincial High School <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The mass request of withdrawal from the third grade students of Songjiang Provincial High School has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Local figures are greatly concerned, because the students are about to complete their studies, and once the trend breaks, it will be very regrettable. All the students in the grade sent representatives to various newspapers to explain the reasons for the school strike, saying that the outside world mistakenly thought it was against the midterm exam, which was a misunderstanding. On Thursday, the 19th of this month, the students of this grade, because there were no classes in the afternoon, and something came up, planned to ask the training department for leave, but could not find the person in charge. The students had not lost their childlike innocence and could not wait long. They left. It was true that the students lacked cultivation and acted rashly. When they returned to school at 3 PM, the class teacher immediately summoned the students who had left the school and reprimanded them. The students did not hide anything and told the truth, and immediately submitted a letter of repentance. They were punished as they deserved. This matter has come to an end. However, Principal Peng later believed that the punishment of Teacher Xue was inappropriate, and expelled three students, and gave the rest a major demerit. Different punishments for the same crime was strange enough. Furthermore, the three students had never received a demerit before, but now, because of one incident of leaving the school, they were deprived of the opportunity to continue their studies and find employment. Considering the regulations for rewards and punishments, how could this be appropriate? Considering the principles of education, how could this be reasonable? The law requires aggravated punishment for repeated offenses, but the three students who received the expulsion had never received a warning or demerit. Why was the punishment so uneven? It was clear that it was due to personal anger. The students in this grade felt sorry for the plight of the three students and pleaded with Principal Peng to extend their hope of continuing their studies. Again and again, they were not allowed. The principal said that words must be followed by laws, even at the cost of sacrificing the entire grade. The students felt the determination of Principal Peng, and therefore, under the Principal's "declaration to sacrifice all the students," made a request to withdraw from school, as a final cry of the weak. Now that the principal has approved everything, this is the process of all students in this grade leaving the school. Yesterday, County Magistrate Jin went to the high school after receiving instructions from the Department of Education to persuade all the students. The students proposed: 1. Please withdraw the order of expulsion. 2. Stop the midterm and graduation exams. Otherwise, they would have to leave school. After repeated persuasion, there was no result. The school authorities sent letters to the students' families on the afternoon of the 30th, hoping that the parents would persuade their children to obey. It was said that all the students had left the school together.</p>

<p>Since the office expenses of the township offices in this county have been changed to an additional tax on land tax, each district has a fixed percentage. Dai Shan, the district chief of the eighth district, has successively collected 526 yuan and six jiao of township office expenses from the public funds and public property management office. Several months have passed, and he has not yet distributed it to the township offices. People are talking, saying that he is suspected of embezzling. Now, Qian Fenfu and other citizens of the district have submitted a petition to the county government, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate thoroughly, so that the township office expenses can be returned to the public and the people can share the benefits of autonomy.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Wuxi: Labor Disputes Over Unpaid Wages at the Taichang Factory <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Taichang Silk Factory, located at Miaogang Bridge outside the East Gate, was opened last winter by Zhang Mingzhai, a local, with Wu Yuquan as manager. It had 276 silk machines. Due to the sharp decline in the silk market, it suffered significant losses and ceased operations on February 10th of this year. It owed more than 1,000 yuan in wages for eight and a half days to over 300 female workers, and over 200 yuan in salaries to staff. The female workers repeatedly demanded payment from the factory, but to no avail. On the 13th of this month, the female workers went to the factory again to demand payment, and the foremen also discussed with Zhu Yongqing, the landlord's rental agent. Zhu then accompanied the female workers to the home of Chen Junsan, who guaranteed the wages at the Chen Yixing Wild Game Store in Zhuchang Alley. He was unable to meet Chen when discussing, and suddenly a conflict broke out with Gao Yangchen, a tenant living with Chen. They were taken to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, where Director Peng required Gao to provide a written guarantee to hand over Chen Junsan. Later, Chen's wife, Qiu, went to Shanghai to find factory owner Zhang Mingzhai and returned to Wuxi to settle the matter. Yesterday, Chen Qiu, along with Zhang's second son, Guangyao, and Wu Yuquan, returned to Wuxi to the Fifth Branch. When the female workers learned of this, they rushed into the Fifth Branch. The bureau refused to accept the case because it involved civil matters. Later, the Public Security Bureau summoned Zhang Guangyao, Wu Yuquan, Zhu Yongqing, and Chen Qiu to the bureau for questioning. As a result, the court ordered the female workers to send sixteen representatives to the bureau to wait for the invitation of the Party Headquarters and the silk factory guild leaders to mediate.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Thoroughly Investigates Fraudulent Activity</p>
<p>Since the County Finance Bureau was merged into the County Government, Chen Ruizhang has been serving as the director of the Land Tax Office. Due to his addiction, he has neglected his duties. Furthermore, Chen Honglian and others have reported him to the County Inspection Office for opium use. This time, County Magistrate Bao suddenly discovered that the staff of the outer treasury, such as Zhai Yongkang, had engaged in fraudulent activities, amounting to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Staff in the inner and outer treasuries colluded with each other. Currently, this case is of great importance, and County Magistrate Bao is conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The Department of Finance Rectifies Business Tax</p>
<p>The amount of business tax revenue reported by the counties north of the Yangtze River to the Department of Finance over the years has been meager. The reasons for this are that merchants are cunning and the county magistrates are favorable to the merchants, feigning compliance and not providing assistance, so the business tax revenue has not improved, which hinders the province's income. As a result, the provincial government's administrative expenses have repeatedly fallen short. Director Zhao, in view of this, decided to rectify the situation. He specifically proposed amending the regulations at the 650th provincial government meeting, reasonably merging the business tax bureaus of the counties, abolishing the district system and changing it to a bureau system to avoid isolation. He also revised the funding methods and appointed a large number of directors, such as Zhou Yulin, who had financial experience, to go to the counties north of the Yangtze River to seek rectification, in order to thoroughly improve the situation. It was also said that if merchants resist payment again, or the county government fails to provide strong assistance, the bureaus should report to the Department of Finance and submit a proposal to the provincial government for severe punishment.</p>

The general passengers are all praising it as cheap, but if this competition continues, the ferry industry will be on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Temporary Alert Due to Bandits Approaching the City</p>
<p>On the night of the 27th, the county government received a report from Jiaxing that bandits had been scattered and requested neighboring counties to be vigilant. Also, around 9 PM that night, the county government received a telegram from Xindai Town, stating that a large number of bandits were attempting to operate north of Zhongdai Town. After receiving the report, the county government feared that the bandits would attack the city that night and immediately convened with the County Public Security Bureau and the County Regular Army to issue a temporary martial law order. All the soldiers were armed and dispatched on patrols, and teams were stationed to defend the main passes of the West Gate and North Gate. At the same time, the First Reserve Team was ordered to search the inns and hotels inside and outside the city, and all traveling merchants were interrogated. In places such as Ti Yun Bridge and Pinghe Inn, eighteen suspects, including Lu Zhiyun, were found, taken to the bureau in batches, and escorted to the county jail for further investigation. It is currently unknown where the bandits have fled.</p>

<p>I recently read a news item in today's (April 30th) Shanghai newspapers stating that "Gunfire from a warship at Gaopukou, Changshu on the afternoon of April 27th." It states that the county police reported that a telegram from the commander of the Zhenchu patrol ship Ji at Hupu stated, "Yesterday's gunfire was from the Navy Hydrographic Department, firing at the rising sandbars. This happens from time to time at ports along the Yangtze River," etc. After investigation, none of the survey ships under this bureau have fired at rising sandbars there. Furthermore, dredging should be used to deal with rising sandbars, not gunfire. This is clearly a false rumor. I am making a solemn statement and respectfully request that your newspaper make a prompt correction. Respectfully, The Chief Editor of Shen Bao, The Hydrographic Department of the Navy, April 30th.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Suspension of Silver Group Securities; Ministry of Finance Subsidizes 100,000 Yuan in Losses; Issues Certificates Instead, Redeemable at Any Time <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that the Yin Geng Loan Guarantee Silver Group, formed by sixteen banks in the city, originally scheduled to issue guarantee securities on April 15th. Later, because the financial authorities did not approve it, the move was virtually suspended. Now the Ministry of Finance has ordered to stop the issuance of the securities, and all preparation expenses have been subsidized by the Ministry of Finance by 100,000 yuan to compensate for the losses. As for the report that the Ministry of Finance took back the issuance itself, it is completely inaccurate. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Motive for Issuance <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The guarantee securities belong to the nature of corporate bonds. The motive for their issuance was at the end of last year, when the Ministry of Finance secured 44 million Yin Geng Loans from various banks. At that time, the banking industry suggested to Minister Kong to issue 30 million guarantee securities, with the Yin Geng Loans mortgaged by the Ministry of Finance as collateral. In addition, the Yin Geng Loan Guarantee Silver Group formed by the sixteen banks and the Ministry of Finance would provide a linked guarantee. Minister Kong Xiangxi immediately approved, and preparations began.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Preparation Process <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The bank authorities, believing that the matter had been approved by the authorities, elected the President of Zhejiang Industrial Bank to preside over the matter. The Yin Geng Loan Guarantee Silver Group office was established at Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Jiangxi Road, San Ma Road, and Zeng Rongpu was hired as Secretary-General to actively carry out the work. It was stipulated that the issuance would take place on April 15th. Merchants, both Chinese and foreign, unanimously trusted this guarantee security.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Order to Stop <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>However, the financial authorities believed that there were still difficulties in implementing this move by the Silver Group, so although Minister Kong verbally approved it earlier, it was delayed in approval. Now it has been decided by Minister Kong and Li Fusun to compensate the Silver Group for its preparation losses of 100,000 yuan, and the Silver Group's preparation for the issuance of guarantee securities will be stopped in accordance with the order.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Issuance of Certificates <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In addition to subsidizing all the losses of the Silver Group with 100,000 yuan, the financial authorities, in order to take care of the banking industry, issued a kind of certificate to the banks for the 44 million yuan that they had previously borrowed from the banks, according to the amount shared by each bank. The banks can redeem the certificates at the Central Bank at any time, but they must pay interest according to the market price. This may be the misunderstanding of the external rumor that the Ministry of Finance took back the issuance itself.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Reason for Cancellation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for the cancellation of the guarantee securities are varied. However, according to a banker, the guarantee securities issued by the Silver Group are stipulated to be issued at 99% of the face value, which is very different from the situation of the government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance, and the weekly interest rate is also lower than the government bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance. This move is related to the credit of the government bonds of the Ministry of Finance, so it was ordered to stop. This statement is more reliable.</p>

He will be able to return to Shanghai in the next few days. Wu will also go abroad for investigation, and during this trip to Beijing, he will also ask the Ministry of Transportation to entrust someone else to act as his agent for bureau affairs during his absence. Although the new organizational law of the bureau has been submitted by the Telecommunications Bureau to the Ministry, it has not yet been approved by the Ministry, so the staff of the merged Telecommunications Bureau will be officially appointed after the new organizational law is promulgated.</p>

<p>National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting Standardized Sichuan Salt and Huai Salt Tax Laws, So That Taxes Are Not Biased and Treasury Revenue Can Increase</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Control Yuan yesterday regarding unequal treatment in Sichuan and Huai salt tax laws, stating: "Recently, a respectful telegram was received from the Zigong Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan, regarding the unequal treatment in Sichuan and Huai salt tax laws, which has led Huai merchants to encroach on Sichuan merchants' sales channels. Except for the original text, which has already been submitted by the Chamber of Commerce for record, and therefore omitted for brevity, the telegram concludes by stating that repeated requests have been made in the past, but equal treatment has not been obtained. If this continues, Sichuan merchants will face bankruptcy and factory closures, and the people who rely on this salt industry for their livelihoods will also lose their livelihoods. It is requested that your association forward the telegram to assist in the appeal, etc. Accordingly, a telegram is respectfully submitted to your office for review and approval, requesting that you instruct the Ministry of Finance and the Salt Affairs Department to immediately ensure that all Sichuan and Huai salt merchants pay taxes equally based on the actual weight of salt sold at the dock, so that the tax laws are not biased and tax revenue can be increased. This is earnestly requested. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, kowtows, seal."</p>

This morning (30th), the clerk of the U.S. Consular Court telegraphed Mr. Hilmi, requesting permission to use his name to issue summonses. Although there are no important cases currently in the court, it is expected that once Mr. Hilmi replies and approves, the U.S. Consular Court will resume normal operations.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Orders Navigation Bureau to Cooperate with Customs to Inspect Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships, Issue Certificates Based on Construction Capacity, and Refuse Overloading</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that recently, Chinese ships have frequently encountered dangers due to overloading. To protect the safety of passengers, it has formulated three measures for inspecting ship load capacity, and yesterday ordered the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau to implement them diligently and consult with the Customs for close cooperation. The relevant measures are excerpted as follows: (1) In the future, when issuing passenger capacity certificates, the Navigation Administration Bureau should assess the capacity of the ship's hull, machinery, and boiler construction within the minimum limits. If the life-saving equipment is insufficient, the inspection certificate should be suspended. (2) Passenger ships passing through Customs should present ship inspection certificates and passenger capacity certificates. If there are no such certificates, or if Customs finds that the number of passengers exceeds the fixed capacity, the ship may be detained and the nearest Navigation Administration Bureau notified to impose penalties in accordance with the regulations. (3) If the above-mentioned ships are forced to carry troops before departure or during navigation, resulting in exceeding the fixed capacity, the captain or managing crew members should refuse. If they encounter force and cannot resist, they should immediately report to the local authorities or the Customs at the ship's initial port of call for instructions. Furthermore, the Ministry of Communications has ordered all navigation administration bureaus to implement these measures uniformly, regardless of whether the ships are Chinese or foreign. The Navigation Administration Bureau is now preparing to inspect foreign ships. However, the implementation date will be determined after the Ministry's order.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou National Goods Company to Be Established, Chongqing Also in Progress</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since its establishment, the National Federation of National Goods Companies and National Goods Introduction Offices has spared no effort in preparing for the establishment of national goods companies in various regions. Yesterday, Mr. Wang Xingyao, a director of the association, told reporters that the Zhengzhou National Goods Company, after consultations between local gentry and merchants and the office, has held an inaugural meeting and elected Zhou Dajia as the general manager and Zhou Wenming as the representative in Shanghai. The two gentlemen have come to Shanghai recently and signed a contract with the office. They are currently staying in Shanghai to select goods. It is reported that the goods they are selecting are mainly silk, wool, cotton yarn, and knitted goods, and they are selecting goods from the association's member factories, such as the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Zhanghua Wool Weaving Factory, Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Zhonghua Knitting Factory. Other daily necessities such as shoes, hats, utensils, electrical materials, cigarettes, and alcohol are also being procured from non-member factories. It is expected that the goods can be prepared and shipped in mid-May, and the opening date is around the 20th. Many other regions have also come to negotiate. In Chongqing, the National Goods Introduction Office originally had a branch, which was funded by local gentry and merchants with 100,000 yuan and supplied with products by the general office. The business is doing well. Now, because the local government plans for a minimum capital of 50,000 yuan for the National Goods Company, a portion of the branch's funds will be used to proceed with the establishment. Chen Shujing has also been selected as the general manager. Furthermore, negotiations in Changsha, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places have also been completed and companies can be established successively.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Resolves Dispute with Jiangjing Ship, Both Parties Sign Four Articles of Reconciliation</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangjing ship, which operates on the Yangtze River line, had a dispute due to the company's compliance with the Ministry of Communications' regulations requiring all employees to sign employment contracts, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers. After the Seamen's Union sent representatives to negotiate with the company, the two parties signed four articles of reconciliation after consultation: (1) Middle-class workers will undergo physical examinations. If they are found to have serious illnesses or addictions, the company will provide medical expenses for a limited period of treatment. (2) The above-mentioned limited period is set at two months. If they cannot recover after the deadline, the workers will bear their own medical expenses. (3) During the treatment period, the company will retain the middle-class workers' right to work. (4) When middle-class workers undergo physical examinations and are found to have illnesses requiring treatment, the company will still issue registration certificates. Once they recover, they will be able to serve on the ship.</p>

<p>The Hubei Construction Department, due to the rapid development of Wuhan ferries and the insufficient number of ships, has applied for permission to add two steel-hulled ferries, worth approximately 120,000 yuan. It recently published a tender notice, setting May 7 as the date for opening bids simultaneously in Shanghai and Wuhan.

The machinery will use a single-leaf engine, and the boiler steam pressure will be 160 pounds to increase speed, equipped with a condenser (commonly known as Kangdingsheng) to save coal. All drawings were designed by Mr. Zhou Houkun, head of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ship Department. The speed will be 8.5 nautical miles per hour. The department is taking this tender very seriously, and only shipyards with experience are allowed to bid. It has also entrusted the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to handle the tender in Shanghai on its behalf. Bids will be opened simultaneously in Shanghai and Wuhan at 1:00 PM on May 7, in order to ensure that the price is low and the quality is solid.</p>

<p>Tao Yongchang, the Main Culprit in the Shooting of Cao Akun, Sentenced to Twenty Years</p>
<p>Cao Akun, a Jiangyin native residing at 50 Renji Road, Pudong, worked as a watchman at the wharf, and was called "insurance" by his peers. On June 28, 21, at 3:00 AM, Cao was playing mahjong at the Ruiji Small General Association on the third floor of 78 Minguo Road, outside the Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, when he was suddenly shot and killed by several enemies. After the incident, the French police arrested Xu Changyu, an accomplice from Ningbo, and sent him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing to thirteen years of imprisonment, which was executed in the Second Prison of Anhui. However, according to Xu's confession, the shooting was carried out by Xiaoxizi (Tao Yongchang), Wangwangjiao Ahu, Xiaotaizhou, Xiaogouzi, Maosheng, Tang Yuanlu, etc. who were at large. In May of last year, Cao Akun's wife, Cao Dai, encountered Tao Yongchang (35 years old this year, a Zhenjiang native, who had been living at 262 Longqing Lane, Huade Road) on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, and immediately called the police to arrest Tao and detain him in the Hongkou police station, and then transferred him to the French police station for delivery to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After repeated interrogations by Judge Li Changnian, Tao stubbornly refused to admit the crime, and the case was delayed for a year. Recently, the court sent police to the court to bring Xu Changyu, who had already been sentenced, to Shanghai for confrontation. Tao then confessed that he harbored resentment because Cao embezzled 4,000 yuan worth of opium, and therefore conspired with his gang to kill him. The trial has now been declared concluded. Yesterday, on the day of sentencing, the police escorted Tao to the court, where Judge Li presided over the first criminal court and sentenced Tao Yongchang to 20 years of imprisonment for instigating and premeditated murder, and deprivation of public rights for life. After the sentencing, Tao was sent back to the detention center to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Yang Binghu Shot One Concubine and Committed Suicide, Male and Female Bodies Autopsied Yesterday, Police Believed that Xie Peide Was a Key Witness in the Case and Must Be Summoned, Mother of One Concubine Came to Shanghai from Shaoxing Requesting Justice for Her Daughter</p>
<p>Xie Peide, manager of China Cement Company, after getting the famous courtesan Yifei Laoliu (originally named Chen Zhujun, also known as Chen Yunxia) out of prostitution, because he remembered that his wife was suffering from a chronic illness and there was no one to manage the household, took her as a concubine. He favored her extraordinarily, and they went in and out together. Later, he met Yang Binghu, grandson of Yang Qiusun, a comprador of Puyi Real Estate Company, at a certain club. The seeds of love were thus sown. Yang was willing to marry Laoliu as his wife, and Laoliu was even more willing to have Yang as her husband. Xie found out about the hidden feelings of both parties, and resolutely gave up his love and gave Laoliu to Yang to become a married couple. Yang chose an auspicious day, April 8, to hold a wedding ceremony with Laoliu at the China Hotel, and Xie even officiated the wedding. Unexpectedly, afterwards, Yang was severely opposed by his parents, and Yang's finances were cut off. Yang had no choice but to divorce Laoliu. On April 26, Laoliu went to Weihaiwei Road Sun Apartment alone to temporarily reside at the home of Jiang Ai, son of her best friend Hong Xianfang. On the evening of the 28th, Yang accompanied his grandfather Yang Qiusun and Xie Peide to visit Laoliu, to bid farewell. During the meeting, Yang suddenly pulled Laoliu to the bathroom, saying that he would talk in secret. Soon, there was a sudden gunshot in the room, and the two people died. After the incident, Yang, Hong, Xie, and others were shocked. Hong Chengde reported to the Chengdu Road police station. The police chief, believing that the area was under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple police station, informed the police station and sent detective He Yunpu to Hong's residence to investigate. Three shell casings and a pistol were found in the bathroom and taken back to the police station, along with two letters of suicide note from Yang Binghu. The two corpses of the male and female were sent to the Red Cross Hospital by car. Doctors examined and found that Laoliu had been shot twice, one bullet entered from the left temple and came out from the right side, and one bullet entered from the chest and came out from the back. Yang Binghu also suffered two gunshot wounds, one entered from the right temple and came out from the left side, and one bullet penetrated the chest and back. Both of them had long been dead. The detectives sent the corpses to the Hongkou Feilun Road autopsy site. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Court and commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei to lead the clerk Wang Zuyi and forensic doctor Zhang Yan to the site. Hong Chengde and Yang Qiusun were summoned by the police station. Chen Wangshi, the mother of Laoliu, was originally in her native Shaoxing. Because she was shocked by the news, she rushed to Shanghai. However, Xie Peide was not summoned. Prosecutor Guo then entered the morgue with forensic doctor Zhang to examine the two corpses in detail. After the examination, they took a seat in the public office. First, the Western police chief reported the details of the investigation after the incident and presented the pistol and other exhibits. He then stated that the pistol's number was 443713, which was found to be owned by the deceased Yang Binghu. Yang was a special police officer during his lifetime, and the gun was issued by the police department. There are three bullets in the gun, and another bullet has already been in the chamber. Whether the three shell casings found were fired from this gun has not yet been examined and cannot be determined. However, Xie Peide is an important witness in this case and has not been seen to arrive at the scene. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed until Xie is summoned for interrogation, so that the case can be clarified. At this time, Chen Wangshi requested justice for her daughter Laoliu, saying that her daughter and Yang Binghu did not commit suicide. Yang suffered two gunshot wounds. If he wanted to commit suicide, he could not have fired two shots himself. He was actually killed by Xie. Her daughter was only 25 years old this year. She came to Shanghai as a prostitute at the age of 19 and was appreciated by Liu Hongsheng. Liu once wanted to marry her, but failed. Later, Liu came to visit with Xie and met Xie. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Xie cheated her daughter away. It has been four years since then, and the mother and daughter have been unable to meet. Now that she heard that her daughter died an unnatural death, she rushed to Shanghai to request justice. Prosecutor Guo reviewed the confession and believed that Xie Peide was an important witness and must be investigated. He then ordered the police station to summon the witness to appear in court this morning for continued interrogation.</p>

The situation of each team is gradually becoming clear. Except for their defeat by Guangdong, Tianma has won all their other matches. Today's match is their crucial test. If Jiande wins, they will face Guangdong in the final. Tianma can only settle for third place. Therefore, their chance of survival depends entirely on tonight's match. The outcome will be reported later. The match will start at 7 PM tonight in the Meifeng Bank table tennis room. Each team participating in this year's competition is entitled to request five admission tickets by letter. The competition results are summarized below.

This is of great importance to the province's education cause. However, the income situation has not been ideal over the years. During the previous meeting of the Education Funding Committee in Zhenjiang, it was decided to establish a Pig Slaughter Tax Research Committee, inviting Ma Ketan, Cao Chu, Xu Mudu, Ren Cheng, Xue Zhongtai, Tan Yigui, Zheng Tonghe and other seven people as members. Recently, Committee Member Zheng Tonghe convened the committee members for the first meeting at Zhenjiang Normal School. Those present were Cao Chu, Xu Mudu, Tan Yigui, Ma Ketan, Xue Zhongtai, Zheng Xigu. Zheng Xigu chaired the meeting, and Cao Chu took notes. The following matters were reported: (1) Explaining the purpose of the committee and the reasons why the previous meeting could not be held. (2) Section Chief Tan of the Management Office reported on the difficulties in collecting the pig slaughter tax. Discussion items: 1. How to understand the actual situation of pig slaughter tax collection in each county.

(2) The Economic Committee shall issue a letter to the Management Office ordering the supervisors of each county to report the actual situation of the pig slaughter tax in their respective counties. If there is no report or the report is untrue, they will be punished. The methods for soliciting articles and the reporting forms for supervisors shall be drafted by Committee Member Ma Ketan. 2. How to transform the system of collecting pig slaughter tax. Decision: Try three methods: (1) Continue to use the merchant contracting system. Counties where the contractors pay the money on time and gradually increase the ratio shall continue to bid for contracting. (2) The business tax bureau directly under the Finance Department shall handle it concurrently. In counties where the contractor is in arrears or the ratio cannot be increased, the business tax bureau shall handle it concurrently. The method of concurrent handling shall be drafted by Committee Member Xu Mudu. (3) Establish a pig slaughter tax bureau to handle it in accordance with the Henan deed tax method. The method shall be drafted by Committee Member Xue Qiaodong. (4) Regarding the implementation of the three systems, observe their advantages and disadvantages and what kind of forces to use as a backing. The methods shall be drafted by Committee Member Zheng Xigu and Committee Member Cao Chu. 3.

Anhui Provincial Department of Education Compiles the 1934 Education Budget, Which Is Approved by the Provincial Government's Standing Committee Anqing Correspondence: The preliminary budget for education and culture expenses in Anhui Province for 1934 has been compiled by the Department of Education and approved by the Provincial Government's Standing Committee. The points of progress are: (1) An increase of 81,548 yuan compared to the previous year; (2) According to the Ministry of Education's secondary education improvement plan, normal schools and vocational schools in the province will be separated; (3) Special funds are listed for reserve expenses, and various educational institutions can enrich equipment and expand content; (4) New projects, such as the establishment of a teacher training department, a national military training committee, and a public lecture hall, etc., and the public expense, increase its business expenses. However, the finances of Anhui Province have always been very difficult. Although there has been an increase in the education budget this time, the provincial government still approved it as it is, which is indeed commendable. Ministry of Education Explains the Method for Party Departments to Establish Elementary Schools The Ministry of Education, according to the Shandong Provincial Department of Education's report on the request of the Teng County Government to explain how elementary schools established by party departments should be handled, specifically instructed the department that, according to the request for interpretation of the doubts about the establishment of elementary schools by party departments, the instructions are hereby approved separately as follows: (1) Since the elementary school run by the party department is named after the party department that runs it, there is no need to add any more names. (2) The rest of the records should be issued by the city and county education bureaus and forwarded to the city and county governments for publication. When issuing, send them directly to the school for safekeeping. The schools established by the party department must report to the competent education administrative organ for record, but there is no need to go through the establishment procedures. (3) The principal of the elementary school established by the party department shall be selected by the party department from qualified personnel and sent to the county and city governments for appointment and reported to the Department of Education for record. The above points should be notified immediately and forwarded for notification.

Zhejiang Department of Education Staff Farewell to Chen Bulei Going to Shanghai Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Education, has been in charge of education in Zhejiang Province twice, for a total of five years. He is usually honest, diligent, and prudent, and his achievements are remarkable. People in the education sector in this province admire him unanimously, and other sectors also respect him. Chen previously resigned from the central government due to poor health and inability to cope with the heavy workload, but his requests were not approved. This time, he asked to leave again, and the central government reluctantly approved his request because Chen's words were sincere. All parties tried to persuade him to stay, but it was in vain, and they were all very sorry. Chen left Hangzhou for Shanghai yesterday, and the staff of the Department of Education, who usually received much guidance, were particularly reluctant to part with him and went to the city station to see him off. It is reported that Chen will stay in Shanghai for three to five days before going to Nanchang to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang.

Presidents of Shanghai Universities Denounce the Absurdity of the Japanese Declaration Since April 17, after the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration on China, all countries in the world have been shocked. China, with its close relationship, is indignant throughout the country, which goes without saying. Yesterday, the presidents of various universities in Shanghai held a joint meeting and issued a declaration, stating that Japan's declaration this time has completely exposed its ambition to deliberately annex China. The great crisis in the Far East is imminent. Not only will China suffer its harm, but all countries in the world will also suffer significant impacts. Japan openly stated its special position in China and opposed China's cooperation with the League of Nations, which means that it has forgotten that China is an independent country. Its contempt for Chinese sovereignty and violation of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty are far more than this. China is a completely independent country and will not allow any country to interfere in its internal affairs. China has absolute sovereignty to cooperate with any other country or obtain assistance from other countries, regardless of its nature, and Japan is not allowed to interfere. Similarly, China does not want to interfere with Japan's cooperation with other countries or obtaining assistance from other countries. For the sake of national survival, China is engaged in peaceful construction. As a member of the League of Nations, it is perfectly legitimate to obtain technical cooperation from the League of Nations. Only Japan is afraid of China's revival and spares no effort to obstruct it in order to achieve its plan to annex China. However, it still recites the mantra of maintaining peace in East Asia and maintaining the territorial integrity of China. Can there be any deception more than this? Japan's so-called maintenance of peace in East Asia and expression of maintaining the territorial integrity of China are all actions such as forcibly occupying Manchuria and invading Shanghai. In order to maintain independent sovereignty and respect international obligations, China cannot tolerate such actions under any circumstances. The undersigned, holding positions in higher education institutions, should lead the Chinese people to resolutely oppose them. We also hope that friendly countries in the world and our Chinese people will not be fooled by Japan's second revised declaration. It should be known that this kind of trickery is only to ease international air pressure. Its original intention of aggression has not changed at all. The Municipal Education Bureau Investigates School-Age Children The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating that Shanghai is a cultural hub for China and foreign countries, and education has always been developed. However, the city has a population of more than 3 million, and only about 120,000 children have been enrolled in school. It is urgent to universalize elementary school education. However, to promote elementary school education, it is necessary to first understand the situation of school-age children in the city who have been enrolled and those who have not, so as to design the whole and actively promote it. The bureau is therefore investigating school-age children in the city and has designated teachers and senior students from municipal and some private schools to be responsible for the investigation. The investigation period is from May 1 to May 31. The investigators will wear investigation certificates to identify them. It is hoped that the residents of the city will understand the bureau's intention to promote elementary school education and clearly inform the investigators and provide them with convenience when they go to investigate. This is of utmost importance.

<p>Telecommunications Industry Voices: Democratizing Telephones (Part 1)   Lü Bing</p>
<p>Since the establishment of China's telegraph industry, although the business statistics have increased year by year, the progress is indeed slow. It cannot be denied. If one says that the telegraph is government-run, so it is bureaucratized, that statement is not entirely accurate. Bureaucratic habits may be enough to affect the industry, but since the Republic of China, there have been many reforms, and today, the bureaus no longer have a bureaucratic air.</p>
<p>According to the author's personal observation, society inevitably views the telegraph as having an aristocratic color, ideally believing that the telegraph price is high and not suitable for ordinary people to use. Those who can enjoy the benefits of the telegraph are only wealthy capitalists or powerful military and political figures. Therefore, when reviewing the previous telegraph business statistics, official telegrams accounted for more than 70%, commercial and industrial telegrams accounted for about 20%, and the remaining private telegrams accounted for less than 10%. Just imagine, how many people in the country can use the telegraph? And how many of those who can use the telegraph are ordinary people? The mutual proportion should evoke a different feeling. So to say that "the telegraph has an aristocratic color" is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>If the telegraph is, according to the ideal of the general public, only used by the higher classes, I can assert that the telegraph business will never develop, and the telegraph industry will not easily progress. The telegraph is set up for the convenience of communication for the people. The more ordinary people use the telegraph, the more widely the telegraph is promoted, and the more significant the effect of communication convenience. Therefore, the four words "aristocratic color" greatly go against the original intention of establishing the telegraph and are something that people in the telecommunications industry are extremely unwilling to hear.</p>
<p>However, the telegraph industry is not comparable to other businesses, there is no so-called attracting customers, no so-called accommodation, gradually official and military telegrams increase, gradually commercial and industrial telegrams and private telegrams still do not develop, the trend is due to the environment. However, people who care about telecommunications policy always think about the development of the telegraph, so as to achieve the purpose of truly facilitating the people. Therefore, "implementing the democratization of the telegraph" is the general call now, and the Ministry of Communications' facilities are also advancing according to this call.</p>
<p>To seek the universality of the telegraph and promote smooth implementation, the first thing is to break the inherent psychology of the public about the telegraph. Ordinary households (referring to those who do not often use the telegraph) do not send telegrams unless it is an emergency, and do not report unless it is an emergency, which is a big mistake. It is important to know that the telegraph is not set up to transmit bad news. Everything that is happy and congratulatory can be communicated through a wire to convey emotions between the two parties. Or some people suspect that the telegraph is an unlucky thing, and ordinary people are shocked when they receive a telegram. The influence of the concept is undoubtedly an obstacle to the democratization of the telegraph, which needs to be reformed and corrected. The general public's misunderstanding of telegraphs should be corrected, so that the public receives telegrams as easily as receiving airmail and registered or express mail, without any suspicion or causing alarm. Therefore, social telegrams, which were not particularly noticed by the telegraph bureaus in the past, are now being vigorously promoted, with preferential treatment, which can arouse the interest of ordinary people in sending telegrams and break the previous misconceptions. This is a method that should be used to implement the democratization of the telegraph.</p>
<p>Wireless and Wireline Merger Implemented  Zhen</p>
<p>Merger Implemented in This City Today; Will Be Realized in Various Places Gradually</p>
<p>Since the Construction Committee transferred jurisdiction over wireless communications to the Ministry of Communications in the 18th year, the telecommunications system has long been complete. However, at that time, jurisdiction over domestic radio stations belonged to the International Telecommunication Bureau and not to the Telecommunications Department, and telecommunications administration was inevitably fragmented. In October of the 21st year, the Ministry of Communications changed the management of domestic wireless affairs to the direct management of the Telecommunications Department, and the cooperative approach was further improved. The current communications authorities believe that the separate establishment of wireless and wireline, living side by side, still has shortcomings in terms of management, economy, and convenience for the people, so they are determined to merge them. In Shanghai, it is scheduled to be implemented today. The name of the new institution will still be the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, which will still be located on Simalu. The original wireless headquarters on Minguo Road will be changed to a telegram receiving and sending office. The internal organization will include a director who is responsible for administrative responsibilities, and a chief engineer who assists the director in handling technical business matters. In addition, four departments will be established for telegram services, business, general affairs, and engineering. The accounting director is still independent. Its organizational regulations and detailed rules of procedure are being drafted and will be implemented in various places. From now on, wireless and wireline will cooperate closely and direct them under the supervision of the same competent official. Telegraph business will have a long-term development. As for the benefits of the merger of wireless and wireline, the following are just a few examples:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding management: Although wireless and wireline were previously under the direct management of the Telecommunications Department, the bureaus were separately established and stood on an equal footing. The competent official is not one person; the internal organization is especially different; opinions occasionally differ, and disputes are easy to arise. Although the Telecommunications Department has stipulated various cooperation methods for bureaus, there are still difficulties in the implementation. It is not a personal problem, but a system problem. After the merger of wireless and wireline, they are subordinate to the same competent official. Who should be assigned to what position? Which telegram should be sent by which route? How should something be carried out? All must be planned and considered as a whole, and the steps are uniform. Once the management is unified, the efficiency will naturally increase.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding economy: At present, the telecommunications economy is extremely exhausted, and maintaining the status quo is still difficult. As for the maintenance of lines, the improvement of equipment, the training of talents, and the reform of the bureau's affairs, all are unable to move forward due to economic difficulties. Thrifty spending is equivalent to creating resources; consolidation can lead to construction. After the merger of wireless and wireline, which station should be moved into which bureau? Which room should be merged into which department? The cost of housing can be saved. Which employee should be assigned to which place? Which worker should be transferred to which place? The allocation of staff will be economical. Extending this to a drop of water, a lamp, a piece of cloth, or a drop of ink, all can be considered and tightened from an economic point of view and the needs of the actual situation. Accumulating little things into a big coat, the number should also be considerable.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding convenience for the people: In the days when the bureaus were separated, it was quite inconvenient for people to send telegrams. Taking Shanghai as an example: If a sender holds two telegrams, one to Suzhou and one to Yunnan, if the sender goes to the telegraph bureau to send them, the bureau will send the telegram to Yunnan to Hankou based on the road conditions, and then the Hankou bureau will send it to its destination, which will take at least a few days. If the sender goes to the radio station to send them, the station may send the telegram to Suzhou to Nanjing, and then the Nanjing station will transfer it to the Beijing bureau for sending to its destination, which will take at least a few hours. This kind of situation has not been common since the promulgation of the inter-bureau cooperation telegram delivery method, but it cannot be guaranteed that it will never happen. If they merge, the telegraph bureau will choose the fastest and most reliable route to send the telegram, and the above-mentioned situation will never happen.</p>
<p>The issue of merging wireless and wireline has been advocated for a long time, but it has not been realized due to various reasons, which critics regret. Now, after careful consideration by the communications authorities, the most appropriate method has been stipulated, and the long-standing case has been resolved at once, which should be welcomed by people in the community.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Miscellany: Telephone—Automatic Viewing a User Choosing Their Desired User</p>
<p>When a user uses an automatic telephone, once the earpiece is held, a "Dial Tone" is heard. Then, the dial is turned one by one according to the number of the user being called until the dial is finished, and the "Busy Tone" is not heard. Unless the called user has no one answering, the two parties can talk to each other. However, after dialing the number and before talking, the user can vaguely hear a series of ringtones in the earpiece, which is technically referred to as the "Ringing Tone". The sound of the ring indicates that the other party's telephone bell is ringing to call the person to answer the call. After a slight "click" sound is heard, the other party's earpiece is lifted, and the two parties can start talking.</p>
<p>Now that both users are talking, there is no need to ask about what they are talking about. Let's take advantage of this free time to move my pen to explain the operation of the machines in the bureau. However, before the description, it should be stated first that there are many styles of automatic telephones, and the construction of the machines and the steps of the operation are different, and there are small differences. My writing of the above is nothing more than to make the general public who use the telephone but do not understand its exact details know a little about the automatic telephone situation. It is not necessary to make extensive quotations, so I will only mention one type as an example. The one mentioned is called the "Strowger Automatic Telephone System", which is a product of the American Automatic Telephone Company. The "Strowger" is relatively common in major cities in my country. I personally think it is appropriate to use it as the material for this article.</p>
<p>Before discussing the machines in the bureau, the various main machines should be roughly described. The user's telephone is connected to the telephone bureau by a single line, and the earth is used as a circuit. It is also connected by double lines, and the circuit also passes through metal lines. In other words, there is a difference between a single line and a pair of lines. Ordinary telephones, except for the Magneto Telephone, which initially used a single line (the magneto telephone requires the user to use a hand-cranked generator to inform the bureau to connect the line), all use double lines. Therefore, the user's automatic telephone is also connected to the telephone bureau by a pair of copper wires. The machine in the bureau to which this pair of lines is connected in the first step is called the Line Switch. If the user uses the telephone, picks up the earpiece, and has not yet dialed, the circuit is connected, and the line switch belonging to the telephone automatically works, selects an empty line, and connects the line to the second step, and the so-called "Dial Tone" is issued immediately.</p>
<p>When the user inserts a finger and dials in order, if the number being called consists of four digits, the first digit dialed causes the second step machine to select an empty line and connect it to the third step, and at the same time, the "Dial Tone" is naturally cut off. When the user dials the second digit, the process goes from the third step to the fourth step. The third and fourth step machines are the same and are called Selectors. According to the level of its action, it is called the first selector and the second selector. When the third to fourth digits are dialed, the process goes from the selector to the Connector, which is connected to the telephone of the called user by another pair of copper wires (a simplified diagram of automatic connection will be published in the next installment). In this case, the middle passage from the telephone being used to the telephone being called is completed.</p>
<p>Wireless and Wireline Cooperation: A Brief History of Wireless Vacuum Tubes (Part 1)   Yuan</p>
<p>In 1873, Guthrie discovered in the laboratory that a high-temperature metal ball placed next to an electroscope could discharge it regardless of whether its load was positive or negative. We should know that when a metal ball is heated, it can sometimes emit positive ions of the gas it absorbs. If the temperature is increased, electrons can be emitted. This is probably the basis of the vacuum tube principle. From 1882 to 1889, German scientists Elster and Geitel, while studying the conductivity of gases near high-temperature solids, used a two-pole vacuum tube. The tube used a carbon filament with a cold metal plate on top. At that time, although attention was paid to unidirectional conductivity, it was not known that it could be used as a rectifier.</p>
<p>In 1883, while studying light bulbs, Edison discovered that the cross-sectional area of the filament was reduced in several places, which not only shortened the life of the bulb but also blackened it. So Edison placed a metal plate in the middle of the two ends of the horseshoe-shaped filament, sealed it tightly inside the bulb, and connected the galvanometer to the lower pole of the metal plate and the filament, and a current passed through. But there was no current when connected to the negative pole of the filament. The above-mentioned current must have passed through the space between the metal plate and the filament, which is called the Edison effect. This is probably the starting point of the invention of modern wireless vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>From 1884 to 1885, Preece, Hittorf, and Goldstein successively researched and discovered the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The type of metal used for the metal plate has nothing to do with the current.</p>
<p>(2) The distance between the metal plate and the bulb, and the potential difference, have a significant impact on the current.</p>
<p>(3) No current flows when the filament is cold.</p>
<p>In 1896, Fleming manufactured a vacuum tube, sealing the filament and cold metal plate (screen electrode) in a vacuum bulb. Fleming used it to detect high-frequency vibrations and make them direct current. He registered it in Britain, the United States, and Germany in 1904 and 1905. This is the so-called Fleming valve.</p>
<p>In 1897, J.J. Thomson published a theory stating that the current between the metal plate and the filament is composed of negatively charged electrons. Electrons are emitted by the hot filament and absorbed by the positively charged metal plate.</p>
<p>In 1904, Wehnelt invented a filament coated with oxidized metal.</p>
<p>In 1907, Lee de Forest added a third electrode, called the grid electrode, between the screen electrode and the filament of a two-pole vacuum tube. This grid electrode is installed in the most appropriate position to control the flow of electrons. After this improvement, the detection effect of wireless vacuum tubes has greatly improved and can be used as an amplifier. Long-distance telephone calls in Europe and the United States have adopted it as a repeater.</p>
<p>Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and a Sense of Shame, and Social Telegrams  Zide</p>
<p>"Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of a country. If the four pillars are not upheld, the country will perish." At this time when we are promoting harmony and liveliness, these four words "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" seem so solemn and important! When I read all the promotional texts and elucidating texts on the newspaper, I couldn't help but associate "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" with social telegrams. There is also "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" in telegrams. Or you may suspect that I am talking nonsense, but let me just say:</p>
<p>"Propriety requires reciprocity" is an old saying in our country. Weddings and funerals can be said to be the most important of proprieties. Sending a few social telegrams, congratulating on what should be congratulated, expressing condolences on what should be condoled, and reciprocating each other is being considerate in observing the etiquette. Who would criticize it as impolite!</p>
<p>When social telegrams are sent to the telegraph bureaus, the internal staff naturally "have the inescapable duty" to send them out as soon as possible, and they will definitely arrive on time, which will make the recipients very grateful. Ordinary people, when something happens to their relatives and friends, usually send some gifts of money. Although money and gifts are also a kind of expression, in my opinion, it is not as solemn as expressing it by telegram. When Chinese people talk about friendship, they focus on the two words "affection and justice", so sworn friendships can be called "結義" (jie yi, meaning to form a bond of brotherhood). According to this statement, sending a telegram not only increases the affection between friends, but it also conforms to the justice of friendship.</p>
<p>As for the affordability of social telegrams, there is no need to say more. According to the current regulations, whether it is in the same province or a different province, Chinese characters only cost two cents per word, and foreign characters only cost four cents per word. The price is low and fast, which can be said to be very affordable and very special.</p>
<p>Social doctors, social stars, social flowers, and people who study social skills and focus on social interaction, if you want to be called a wide social network, this kind of social telegram is really very useful. In ordinary European and American social circles, men and women who live in different places often send social telegrams to each other constantly. Chinese people talk a lot about social interaction, but if they have not received or sent a single social telegram, to put it in a vulgar way, it is called "losing face". Isn't losing face shameful?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points "are not wishful thinking". The four words "propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame" can be contained in everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Everywhere has profound meaning, and even the small can reveal the big. Why is it not so only for social telegrams? Let me record what I said as a guess.</p>
<p>Public Telephone Problems  Telecommunications Reporter</p>
<p>Since the publication of this magazine, we have often received letters from all walks of life discussing and exchanging telecommunications issues. Collecting everyone's ideas can serve as a reference for our colleagues and also show the enthusiasm of all walks of life in caring about the telecommunications industry. What I, as a reporter, am now proposing is the issue of public telephones. This matter has been concretely resolved in Europe and the United States. In our country, as far as I have seen and heard, only Shanghai has discussed implementation, and it is rarely seen in other places. The letter writer is Mr. Tang Binru, and the main points of his letter are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>"In our... country, ordinary households who do not have a telephone often borrow from others, which is called 'borrowing a telephone.' 'Borrowing a telephone' is really extremely troublesome. Those who are willing to lend are mostly familiar with each other and have a good relationship. Otherwise, it is not convenient to borrow from neighbors and they have to travel further or ask politely. Or they think that installing a telephone themselves will solve everything, but consider that they do not make many calls in normal times. In case of emergency, they only make one or two calls a month. It is unbearable for economical people to pay a month's telephone bill for one or two calls. Therefore, the best solution is for the telephone bureau to run public telephones..."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Tang, this kind of situation actually exists. When "borrowing a telephone," the telephone bill does not increase for the household lending the telephone, but the telephone bureau is busier because of the borrowing of telephones, and on the other hand, the result of busier business is that the income does not increase. Overseas countries that are known as advanced in telephone services have long considered this and set the standard for charges based on the number of telephone calls. The recording of the number of calls and the prepaid telephone fees to get through the call, all kinds of methods, each with its own machinery, are all to ensure that the users of the telephone can get a fair deal, and since there are many places where public telephones are set up, those who borrow telephones will naturally disappear. Setting up public telephones in major cities in our country is thought to be either unprofitable or to have many drawbacks. In the end, the stalemate lies here. For the convenience of social use, it is issued for publication, and if we can express our opinions to discuss each other, it will not only have the interest of research, but it will also provide a reference for the authorities.</p>
<p>The First Chinese Person in the World to Use a Telephone  Jiemin</p>
<p>During the American Gold Rush era, there was a sixteen-year-old Chinese child named Zhang Guang, who traveled across the ocean to the United States. Later, he opened a shop in San Francisco called "Guangli". It was 1878, 56 years ago. The telephone had only been in the world for two years, and all the equipment was rudimentary. Zhang Guang was able to see its convenience and installed a telephone in the shop. He never expected that he would be the first Chinese person in the world to rent a telephone. Zhang Guang died in 1918, but his shop is still run by his descendants, and the San Francisco telephone directory has always contained the name "Guangli" from 1878 to the present.</p>
<p>Post and Telecommunications Cooperation  Xingmin</p>
<p>It is common practice in all countries around the world to have the post office and the telegraph office located in the same place. In the past, although the post offices and telegraph offices in various parts of our country were in the same city, they had their own offices. Now, they must be combined in one place. This move was seen in the clear orders of the Ministry of Communications. Those who have already implemented it in various places have reported, and those who are in the process of implementation will soon solve the housing problem.</p>
<p>The post office and the telegraph office are in the same place. Not only do the postal and telegraph services belong to the same ministry, but they also have the same goal of seeking convenience for the public in communication. Or you may think that the merger means that the postal and telegraph services are in the same place and the business is divided, or you may think that the joint establishment seems to be closer. It turns out that the original post office has enough space to leave space for the telegraph office to work, or the telegraph office's building is spacious enough to let the post office work, and they can all move to that place. In addition, telegraph branches can sell stamps and receive mail, and post offices can also receive telegrams on behalf of others. Mutual benefit, the intention is very good. Since the revolution, cooperation, labor and expense cooperation, consumption is also cooperation. If we use this to describe the methods promoted by the Ministry of Communications, then the four words "post and telecommunications cooperation" seem to be able to represent the intentions of the authorities.</p>
<p>Post offices can be more accessible to the majority of the public in terms of communication. Gathering together with the telegraph office will naturally make the telegraph office more familiar to the public. This move is very beneficial to those who send telegrams. However, postal remittances from the post office can be achieved quickly because the telegraph office is nearby. The postal bureau is even more prosperous, because the area is wide and there are not many branches, so it often sets up ticket sales agencies or postal agencies in shops. If the telegraph or telephone branches can handle this on behalf of others to assist each other, then how shallow is the convenience gained by those who send mail?</p>
<p>European Telephone Paradise - Sweden  Chen Yanding</p>
<p>Innovative Methods for Using Telephones</p>
<p>The prosperous cities of Sweden are equipped with a "waiting line," which is specially set up for ticket agencies, train stations, travel agencies, newspapers, news agencies, and other places with busy telephone traffic. Whenever you want to talk to these places and cannot get through due to busy telephone traffic, the call is connected to the waiting registration room, and the number is recorded. As soon as the line is clear, it is connected. For special telephone services such as requesting the operator to call or report the time at regular intervals, the cost is also two and a half cents in US dollars each time. Just in the capital of Sweden, various special telephone services exceed 50,000 times a year. No wonder Sweden is known as the "European Telephone Paradise."</p>
<p>Recently, there was an extremely interesting event: Ms. Stockmjalson of the Swedish capital and Mr. Klasen of Toluo City, Michigan, USA, married using a transatlantic wireless phone. It turned out that Mr. Klasen traveled to Sweden last year and met Ms. Jalson. The two planned to marry in Sweden in July, but were interrupted by a sudden telegram from the company where they worked in the United States, which called them back to the United States. Now, because of work, he cannot go to Sweden. If they want to marry in the United States, Ms. Jalson is originally from Sweden, and according to US immigration regulations, she cannot come to the United States before she is married. The two parties found another way to get married using wireless phones. The wedding time was 9:00 am in the United States and 3:00 pm in Sweden. When the bride and groom used a wireless phone to transmit the words "yes" and "willing", both parties asked local government officials to attend the wedding and used a gramophone to transmit wedding music across the Atlantic in both directions to match the ceremony. However, just as Mrs. Klasen was about to set off for the United States, she received a telegram stating that the Immigration Bureau regarded telephone marriage as illegal and opposed her coming to the United States. However, the mayors of Toluo and Stockholm both believe that the marriage procedure is legal. It is thought that this matter will eventually be resolved satisfactorily. This is also an interesting story.</p>
<p>Anecdotes about Marconi (2)   Fan</p>
<p>"Marconi has made great contributions to the Italian Navy. He had a relationship with the Navy very early on. After he left his home country to work in England, because Italy had conscription, he had to return home to serve. But at that time, there were many people studying wireless electricity, and he was afraid that if he missed the opportunity, he would have no hope of success. So he asked the Italian embassy in London to find a way to request the Navy Department to exempt him from military service. Later, he received a reply from the Navy Department asking if he had any tasks at sea. London thought of a way for him and said, 'Marconi has a fishing boat that he sails himself. This can be proven by someone.' Originally, the Italian Navy Department exempted him from his military service obligations, so Marconi was able to continue his experiments in London. During the European War, Marconi returned to his country to serve. At this time, the Italian Emperor gave him the position of Major in the Army Corps of Engineers. However, the Navy Department thought that Marconi had served in the Navy before and had worked hard, so they gave him the title of Navy Colonel. At the Paris Peace Conference, he was the Italian plenipotentiary representative at the suggestion of the Navy Department."</p>
<p>"Marconi loved to travel very much. After the European War, he bought a yacht that used to belong to the Archduke of Austria. He called it Elettra. He did a lot of work on this yacht. The first time was in April 1920, when he set off from Southampton with Cap Finarerre and eLisdonne to test the radio direction finder. At the same time, he also tested the first broadcast range in London. In 1922, Elettra went to Csennes to participate in the International Radio Conference. In the same year, he also conducted various tests on radio telegraph and radio telephone in the Atlantic. The following year, he began his most famous short-wave beam experiment. From 1924 to 1925, he set off again to test the transmission of short waves and the relationship between the altitude of the sun. In the same year, he also made various demonstrations of the radio indicator for navigation benefits. Another time was at the opening of the Sydney Electrical Exhibition in Australia in March 1930. On that ship in the Mediterranean, he used radio to control the switches in the exhibition, making the whole day bright, which was the most eye-catching."</p>
<p>From the book Lrigi Solsri, we can see that Marconi's life was constantly doing and constantly thinking, which is the key to his success. It is worth learning from us.) (End)</p>
<p>Living Together in Love  Guan</p>
<p>Telecommunications and postal services are both important tools of transportation and are both under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. In reality, they assist each other, like lips and teeth. However, judging from the history that has passed, I feel that postal services have their own evolution, and telecommunications have their own environment. They share the same path but do not work together, which may be the reason.</p>
<p>Now I know that the Ministry of Communications is implementing measures for post and telecommunications cooperation for the convenience of public communication. The so-called cooperation is not a merger, because a merger means that the postal and telecommunications services are not separate, while cooperation means that they are still autonomous. However, communication business will be able to help each other further than before. It is said that the third and fourth-class telegraph bureaus in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei and other provinces will first join the post offices in co-location, so that those who send letters and telegrams can get what they want as soon as they enter the door. In terms of content, cooperation is being implemented. In terms of appearance, it can be called living together. Since post and telecommunications are living together, the business and personnel will become more connected and close. Therefore, when I heard the news, I took the four words "living together in love" to mark this article, not to talk about love, but to show that post and telecommunications can cooperate sincerely.</p>
<p>New Telegraph Fee Reduction Regulations</p>
<p>(1) For Chinese telegrams where the recipient's full name and address do not exceed 15 characters, a flat fee of five characters will be charged.</p>
<p>(2) Domestic social telegrams, regardless of whether they are in the same province or another province, will cost two cents per Chinese character and four cents per foreign character.</p>
<p>(3) No additional postage will be charged for telegrams forwarded by post.</p>
<p>(4) No additional railway transit fee will be charged for telegrams transited through railway stations.</p>
<p>If any telegraph office does not charge according to the new regulations above, please send the receipt of the telegraph fee to the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing for investigation.</p>

<p>Shanghai Bureau Merges with Radio Station</p>
<p>The radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications were ordered by the Ministry of Communications to merge in order to effectively connect with the wireline bureaus in business. Now the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and the Shanghai Radio Headquarters will first merge from today, and the name will be Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. In the future, all official documents should be sent directly to the Telegraph Bureau on Fuzhou Road. All telegram receiving and sending matters will still be handled at the original site. However, those who send telegrams, whether wireline or wireless, can send them at both places.</p>
<p>Revised Telegraph Registered Code Regulations</p>
<p>The newly revised telegraph registered code regulations stipulate that the validity period for long-term registration is calculated from January 1st or July 1st to the end of the year or the end of June. The validity period for short-term registration is calculated from the first day of the month of registration. This method was originally designed to facilitate the telegraph bureau's examination of expired registrations. However, since the implementation on April 1st, many businesses believe that the validity period of registration is not without loss. In order to take care of the interests of businesses, the Ministry of Communications has now corrected the above-mentioned clause and changed it to calculate on a daily basis. For example, if you register for one year on April 16th, it will be calculated until April 15th of the following year. At the same time, in order to facilitate the telegraph bureau's inspection of registration, a new type of card box has been purchased to facilitate business.</p>

<p>Shen Bao (Shanghai Local Supplement): How to Deal with This Difficult Problem  Yafei</p>
<p>The problem is laid out like this, unfolding, endlessly unfolding; but it is becoming more serious! At present, an inferior and tense atmosphere has tightly enveloped the international relationship between China and Japan; it has even permeated the whole world; surging, surging, it will stir up a more unfortunate great tide, scattering the peace of the world!</p>
<p>But, although everyone knows it is a serious problem, how are we going to deal with this problem! That is a very difficult thing. Because, being strong is not possible, and being weak is not possible; the Japanese use both soft and hard tactics, while our country can't use either. This is really enough to make people laugh and cry.</p>
<p>But, are we still dreaming that other countries will help us? We only need to open our eyes to see how other countries are behaving; they are also confused and intangible! First, they said: "Unanimously and severely sanction Japan's oppression of China"; then they said: "Various countries have understood Japan's tough statement." Originally, their envy and jealousy were just a sour reaction. Because they saw that the interests of the Far East market were going to be seized by the Japanese, they started to get anxious. How could they really sympathize with China and help China? At most, it is just "a crocodile's tears, false compassion"!</p>
<p>Or are we hoping that the League of Nations will uphold justice for us? Yes, it is an organization that holds the highest authority in the international community. It has the responsibility to resolve international disputes and the mission to lead world peace. But its paper tiger has long been pierced by the Japanese, its responsibility and its mission are just some deceptive masks. Only the Chinese are foolish enough to be fooled by it. Only those who are bored and desperate will worship this Bodhisattva. This lesson has already told us very clearly in our past experiences.</p>
<p>So, what method should we ultimately use to deal with this serious and difficult problem? We can only hope that the wise government of today will uphold a consistent stance of never yielding and never compromising; not seeking help from others, but relying entirely on ourselves to save ourselves. "Better to be a broken jade than a complete tile," and never let their conspiracy succeed. We also do not need this kind of "suffering in silence, seeking complete safety through compromise" attitude of appeasement. At this time when the survival of the country is at stake, what we hope for today is "cooperation between the government and the people", cooperating to prepare for self-rescue, because there is no other way out except for self-rescue.</p>
<p>Now, China's borderlands such as Annam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, and Myanmar have already been separated from China's territory. The lessons of the past are not far away and can serve as a warning. Now that the great powers are not working hard to nibble away at our territory; fellow countrymen! In this autumn of crisis and survival, if we do not save ourselves, when will we wait!</p>

<h3 id="e134">Flour Export: Refund of Import Tax on Foreign Wheat Approved; Customs Issues Announcement for Implementation Today; 80% Refund of Original Tax Paid on Flour Exports; Flour Association Holds Emergency Meeting to Request Amendment <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the amount of flour transported to and sold in the three northeastern provinces was substantial. Since the "September 18th Incident," the situation has drastically changed, and the market in the three northeastern provinces has been completely monopolized by the Japanese, leading to a sharp decline in the flour industry, with stockpiles accumulating like mountains. The Shanghai Flour Association has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance for relief to alleviate the difficulties. Now, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated seven measures, approving that flour made from foreign wheat, if transported abroad for sale, will be eligible for a refund of 80% of the import tax paid on the wheat at the time of import, to provide relief. The Flour Association held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday to discuss a submission to the Ministry, requesting a full exemption in order to enable exports. However, the Jianghai Customs has already issued an announcement yesterday for implementation, fearing that it may be impossible to reverse the situation. Our reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency has specially investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Customs Issues Announcement by Order <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs Announcement No. 1336, regarding the issuance of regulations for the refund of import tax on raw wheat for wheat flour made from foreign wheat and transported for sale overseas: It is hereby announced that the Ministry of Finance has issued temporary regulations for the export of wheat flour and the refund of import tax on raw wheat. Hereafter, any flour mill that uses foreign wheat and, within one year of import, manufactures wheat flour for transport and sale overseas, will be granted a partial refund of the import tax on the raw wheat as a preferential treatment. The following seven articles of the aforementioned regulations are recorded as follows: Temporary regulations for the export of wheat flour and the refund of import tax on raw wheat: ㈠ Flour mills that use foreign wheat and, within one year of import, manufacture wheat flour for transport and sale overseas, will be granted a refund of the import tax on raw wheat. The refund of import tax on raw wheat will be calculated based on the standard of 75 kilograms of flour produced per 100 kilograms of raw wheat. The amount of tax to be refunded will be 80% of the original tax paid. ㈡ When flour mills request a refund of import tax on raw wheat for wheat flour transported and sold overseas, they shall, prior to reporting the export, prepare three copies of a request form, together with detailed evidence of the import tax paid on the raw wheat, as well as the loading list issued by the official representative of the exporting vessel or vehicle, and submit them to the Customs. ㈢ The application for refund of import tax on raw wheat for wheat flour exports shall clearly state the following items: (A) The name and address of the flour mill; (B) The type, origin, or place of production, import date, quantity, and name of the vessel or vehicle carrying the imported wheat; (C) The trademark, number, quantity, export date, and name of the exporting vessel or vehicle of the wheat flour for export, as well as the loading location. ㈣ If the imported raw wheat is not directly purchased by the flour mill, the proof document of the original importer's resale to the flour mill shall be submitted for verification together. ㈤ The wheat flour for which a refund of import tax on raw wheat is requested shall be limited to those reported for export by the original Customs office where the raw wheat was imported. ㈥ When the Customs approves the refund of import tax on raw wheat for exported wheat flour, it shall issue a "Wheat Tax Payment Certificate," but this "Wheat Tax Payment Certificate" shall only be used to offset the import tax on wheat. ㈦ Regarding cases requesting tax refunds, the Customs may conduct necessary investigations at the relevant flour mills. All merchants are hereby notified. April 28th, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Superintendent Tang Hai'an, Tax Commissioner Bolode.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Flour Association Meeting <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Flour industry colleagues, believing that this measure is still unable to place export trade in a victorious position, convened an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday on the second floor of the Fuxin General Company on Jiangxi Road to request the Ministry of Finance to amend it. Those attending included Gu Xin'yi, Wang Yaochen, Chen Meisu, Chen Ganting, Tao Renqian, Jin Mingfu, Shi Fuhou, Fang Shanchen, Zhao Xianzhi, and more than ten others. The important resolutions decided were: ㈠ Regarding Article 6 of the temporary regulations for the export of wheat flour and the refund of import tax on raw wheat, which states that when the Customs approves the refund of import tax on raw wheat for exported wheat flour, it shall issue a wheat tax payment certificate, but this certificate can only be used to offset the import tax on wheat. It is understood that when exporting wheat flour, the price must be lowered in order to compete with foreign flour. The refunded tax is to offset the reduced price. It was unanimously agreed that the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration should instruct the Customs to issue cash or, according to Customs practice, issue deposit slips to facilitate the payment of various Customs duties. The reason is that the purchase of foreign wheat depends on whether China has a good harvest year. If China has a good harvest, there is no need to purchase foreign wheat. If a tax payment certificate is limited to wheat only, it is equivalent to waste paper. It was resolved to proceed accordingly. ㈡ Regarding Item 第 within Article 1 of the temporary regulations, which states that the refund of import tax on wheat will be calculated based on the standard of 75 kilograms of flour produced per 100 kilograms of raw wheat, and the amount of tax to be refunded will be 80% of the original tax paid. It is understood that when exporting wheat flour, the price must be lowered in order to compete with foreign flour. If the tax is refunded at 80% of the original amount, it will not be sufficient to compete with foreign flour. It was unanimously agreed that the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration should instruct the Customs to refund the tax amount according to the standard of 75 kilograms of flour produced per 100 kilograms of raw wheat. It was resolved to proceed accordingly.</p>

<p>The Chicago World's Fair is scheduled to open on the 26th of this month in Chicago. Zhang Xianglin, the chief representative of China's participation, and Zhang Wendi, a standing director, along with three others, will depart today on the American Mail Line steamer "Grant." They will also take with them the Chinese exhibits for the fair. The trip is expected to take seventeen or eighteen days to reach Chicago. The Chinese pavilion has been expanded this year, and the exhibits have increased by two-thirds compared to last year.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Tax Commissioner of Jianghai Customs yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Exhibit Coordination Association for China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair, stating that the association's exhibits shipped to Chicago last year were guaranteed for tax payment by your esteemed office's letter to Jianghai Customs, which is on record. As the fair continues to be held this year, the association plans to supplement the exhibits with 2,000 boxes. In addition to requesting Jianghai Customs to examine the Ministry's order and the precedents from last year and grant tax-free release to the 2,000 boxes of exhibits that the association will ship to Chicago in batches, we specifically request your esteemed office to send a letter to the Tax Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, guaranteeing that the exhibits for this year's fair will still be subject to tax payment based on the actual number of items sold after the opening of the fair, which would be deeply appreciated, etc." It has been verified that the association has repeatedly shipped exhibits to Chicago last year, and our Chamber has requested tax exemption and inspection waiver according to the precedents, and it has been stated that the Chamber guarantees the payment of taxes for all exhibits that are not returned after the deadline or sold at the fair. As the fair continues this year, there is still a need to supplement the exhibits with 2,000 boxes, which is the same as before. Accordingly, we request your esteemed office to examine and approve the tax-free release according to the precedents. This is for official comity."</p>

<p>Eight Boxes of Eight Steeds and Four Boxes of French Tapestries</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, some antiquities from the Beiping Antiquities Exhibition Hall, deposited in the Forbidden City, were sent to Shanghai for airing due to concerns about dampness during the spring mildew season. The director of the exhibition hall, Fu Yiwen, was sent to Beijing to consult with the internal authorities, who agreed to the airing. The internal authorities also sent Lu Xirong and Zhang Guogan to take care of the process. They arrived in Shanghai ten days ago, but work was delayed due to continuous spring rains. Yesterday, the weather cleared, and airing began. The Central Bank sent personnel to open the storage, and Zhang Guogan from the Ministry of Interior, Zhou Zijing from the Academia Sinica, Fu Yiwen from the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, Ouyang Banghua from the Forbidden City Office, and Ouyang Shu from the Shanghai Local Court supervised the airing. According to Mr. Zhang Guogan, the items aired yesterday and today were eight boxes of "Eight Steeds" paintings and four boxes of French tapestries. The work for tomorrow and the day after will depend on the weather. The procedure is to first open the original package and place it in the sun for a short period of time, then repack it into the original box with several mothballs, seal it, and return it to the original storage. He also said that after this inspection, it was found that the antiquities were not damp, and the airing time could be shortened to a maximum of one month.</p>
<h3 id="e141">China's Woolen Yarn Products are Improving Daily <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>"Diyang" Brand Sales Have Exceeded "Bee" Brand</p>
<p>China's woolen yarn weaving industry has been promoted by the government and worked on by experts in industry, and it has finally begun to rise. However, the encroachment of capitalistic industrial nations such as England, Germany, France, Japan, and Russia on the woolen yarn weaving market in our city has not slackened. Yesterday, Zhao Zizhen, the deputy manager of the Tianjin Dongya Woolen Textile Company, came to Shanghai on business. According to an interview with a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, China's commercial market is almost entirely controlled by various capitalistic empires. Last year's import surplus was 400 million yuan, of which the woolen yarn item alone accounted for approximately 30 million yuan. The amount of outflow is truly alarming. Our company in Tianjin is carefully weaving woolen yarn products, which can fortunately resist foreign goods. Currently, in order to gather strength and save the country through industry, in addition to the original capital of 500,000 yuan, we are continuing to solicit 300,000 yuan in shares to strengthen funds and increase the quantity of products. This year, the company's "Diyang" brand woolen yarn, with its high quality and low price, has been able to suppress the sales of the imported "Bee" brand. However, a certain country is quite jealous of the company's daily progress.</p>

<p>The Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee has determined that the disaster relief work in the disaster area has come to an end. Therefore, the disaster relief and health groups were ordered to conclude yesterday. The labor relief group will postpone the conclusion for one or two months because some labor relief projects in the disaster area have not been fully completed. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Xi Dejiong, the director of the disaster relief group, yesterday morning, but he had not yet arrived at the office. Xi Tongqing, the director of the general affairs section, received the reporter on his behalf and spoke as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Two Groups Ordered to Conclude <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the committee has actively carried out labor and disaster relief work in the disaster area, and many disaster victims have been rescued. As the disaster relief work has come to an end, the disaster relief and health groups were ordered to conclude at the end of April. The disaster relief agencies in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, such as the investigation and distribution bureaus, also concluded one by one today. The three provinces' investigation and distribution bureaus issued approximately 800,000 disaster relief coupons, which will be collected one by one and submitted to the audit committee for review before being reported to the Ministry of Finance. As for the disaster relief group, the original budget was 1.5 million yuan. However, due to the empty national treasury and the lack of spring relief, a total of only slightly less than 1.1 million yuan has been used, which is extremely important. The remaining relief will likely be handled by the provincial governments of the respective provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Labor Relief Postponed <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>As for Kong Xiangrong, the director of the labor relief group, he went to Kaifeng and other places on the 21st with his staff to inspect the labor relief projects and will return to Shanghai in a few days. The labor relief group is unable to determine the conclusion date because some labor relief projects in the disaster area have not been completed. However, it is understood that the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee will not conclude until all groups have fully concluded.</p>

<p>According to the Japan-Japan News Agency, sources from foreigners in this city say that Japan has been using the propaganda of the North China incident to secretly try to disturb South China. It will convene Japanese consuls from Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shanghai, Shantou, Guangdong, and other places in Taiwan to hold a so-called "cross-strait conference" to formulate concrete plans for disturbance. This very obvious move is indeed worthy of attention. Currently, it is quite active in enticing frustrated politicians and buying out traitors. It has also sent well-trained young Japanese men to infiltrate Min, Xia, Shan, and Yue to lure ignorant farmers and merchants to join the so-called Eastern Church newly organized in Taiwan, using consular jurisdiction to instigate resistance to donations and tax refusal to benefit the foolish people and disturb public order. The increasing number of foreign-branded stores in Fu, Xia, Shan, Yue, and other places, and the active movements of Japanese and Taiwanese ronin, are also credible. There is also the purchase of bandit Wu Cijing, who is known for his mischief in the deep mountains at the junction of Hua'an and Longyan, as one of its strategies to disturb China. In short, Japan's feint to the east and attack to the west, and its ambition to seize South China, are becoming increasingly exposed.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Pedri Lane Without Water for the Seventh Day: Tenants Organized a Large-Scale Petition Yesterday; Hundreds of Women Carrying Lead Buckets to Demand Water; Father Xu Anxious and Negotiates with Western Constable... Tenants of Da Tong Road Issue Declaration... <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Pedri Lane on Da Tong Road has been without water since the landlord, the Catholic Church, illegally increased water fees and instructed the water company to turn off the water meter. Yesterday was the seventh day. The landlord has not expressed any opinions since the water was cut off, and is determined to use high-pressure tactics to force the tenants to submit. However, the tenants are extremely angry and will not succumb to this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to sending a telegram to the Roman Catholic Church to accuse the Shanghai Catholic Church of disregarding humanity, they also organized seven petition groups, each with five or six people, carrying petitions to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Taxpaying Chinese Association, the Municipal Council, the New Gate Police Station, and other places to hold a large-scale petition. Hundreds of women in the neighborhood also organized a water-seeking group. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, hundreds of women, each holding a lead bucket, raced to the Catholic Church in Qiude Elementary School, using firecrackers as a signal, to demand water. Father Xu in the church was extremely frightened to see hundreds of women pouring in, and quickly reported to the New Gate Police Station by phone, which dispatched more than ten Chinese and Western detectives. Father Xu intended to use the authority of the Chinese and Western detectives to disperse the crowd, but the Western constable said that the women's taking water with buckets was very civilized and did not involve any excessive actions, so the police station was not convenient to interfere. He then ordered Father Xu to open the tap in the church from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM every morning and allow the women to fetch water. Father Xu was very frustrated to hear this, and sighed that the great way was not being followed. Furthermore, Wang Chenggu, the lawyer representing the tenants, had previously sent a letter to the water company, according to the exclusive contract between the Municipal Council and the water company, requesting the rapid restoration of the water supply. Yesterday, he received a reply in English from the water company, but the reply was evasive and to the point. Lawyer Wang, accompanied by representatives of the tenants, then went to the water company to negotiate. The foreign manager of the water company received them. Lawyer Wang repeatedly argued on the basis of reason, but it was still ineffective. The landlord's representative then proposed that the water company was commercial in nature, and since the landlord was unwilling to bear the water bill and the water was cut off, the tenants were willing to pay cash as a guarantee and requested that the water be turned on first and then negotiate with the landlord. Although the foreign manager was speechless and understood the reasons, he still refused.</p>
<p>The Reduce Rent Branch of Pedri Lane on Da Tong Road issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "It has been said that guests and hosts enjoy the beauty of the Southeast, and overseas Chinese value good neighborly relations. We, the tenants residing in the Pedri Lane houses owned by the Catholic Church, before 1930, the rent was 28 yuan and 40 cents, and the 7.5% water fee was included, so the water price was always borne by the landlord. Later, because the water company increased the water fee, the landlord in this lane added one yuan of water fee to each household. At that time, although there were no such bad rules in Shanghai, we had to reluctantly bear it in order to maintain good neighborly relations and friendship with the host. When the January 28th Incident broke out, the landlord suddenly ordered each household to bear 60 cents of patrol fees. It was found that the patrol officers in this lane were hired by the landlord to protect the Pedri Girls' Elementary School. At a time when airplanes and guns were booming, residents had no time to escape. This is another bad rule set by taking advantage of the danger. How could we know that their hearts were still not satisfied? In November of last year, the manager verbally notified that another five yuan of water fee would have to be added to each household. We were very dissatisfied with this, because the market after the war has been in a slump, and the original rent has already been unbearable, let alone an increase. Therefore, we organized the Pedri Lane Tenant Self-Government Association to resist its insatiable desire. The landlord, knowing that public anger was difficult to offend, automatically reduced the increase to four yuan. Soon, the rent reduction movement rose like a storm, and we also reorganized the rent reduction branch. The landlord even more automatically reduced the increase to two yuan for the water fee. We then investigated with the water company, and the total water fee for this lane from January to March 1934 was only 360 yuan on average per month (including the water fees for Pedri Girls' School and Pedri Hospital), while the inherent 7.5% water fee in the rent of 126 households in the entire lane reached 264 yuan and 60 cents, plus the previous increase of one yuan per household, totaling 126 yuan. The two together reached 390 yuan. This means that the water fee paid by the tenants to the water company still has a surplus. Moreover, after April, the water fee is calculated at 80% of the original price, and the profit reaches 100 yuan. Now that the water has been cut off for a week, we have experienced hardship. We demand that the 7.5% water fee be deducted from the rent so that we can install our own water meters, but the landlord has refused again. Alas, the oppression and high pressure we are facing are the opportunity for all tenants in Shanghai to be in danger. This trend cannot be allowed to grow, and this precedent cannot be set. I hope that all those who are clear-sighted at sea will observe it together and rise up to help. We are extremely sincere in our prayers."</p>

<p>The Yingkou Yuda Shipping Company was originally founded by Chinese investors such as Bao Yucai and others. It had a significant presence in North China. After the Northeast was lost, the company was confiscated by the puppet state. After being returned, it has now been taken over by the puppet Manchukuo, and a Japanese has been appointed as the general manager. The ships have also been rerouted to various parts of Japan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Confiscation Process <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Yuda Shipping Company has branches in Yingkou, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other ports. After the Northeast was lost, the puppet Manchukuo authorities, on the grounds that the company had shares held by important figures in the Northeast, temporarily confiscated it. After strong protests from the local business community, the puppet state registered its shares and sent personnel to monitor the company's operations. However, after the 15th of this month, the puppet state authorities again implemented the takeover of the Yuda Shipping Company. Bao Yucai, the Chinese general manager, has been dismissed, and the puppet state has appointed a Japanese to serve as the general manager of Yuda. The Japanese has already arrived at the company to take over all affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Reassignment of Staff <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Yuda Company has a total of three ships: Yutong, Yuda, and Yuji. The new general manager appointed by the puppet state has changed the flags of all three ships to the puppet Manchukuo flag. All personnel on the ships, even if they are Chinese citizens, must register at the Navigation Administration Bureau established by the puppet state in Yingkou. Even the personnel in the business department must register at the bureau. Therefore, salaries are paid using puppet state paper money. The bureau's staff will gradually be replaced by Japanese and puppet personnel.</p>

<p>The company's shipping routes originally ran to Yingkou, North China, and Shanghai and South China. Since the Japanese takeover by the puppet state, many Chinese merchants have changed to other ships for shipping their goods. Only Japanese goods are loaded. Therefore, the ships Yutong and others are sailing between Yingkou and Japan. Some Chinese crew members have resigned and returned to Shanghai to seek employment on national ships. However, as each ship still has shipping permits for various ports, it is still able to operate normally to the north and south oceans and Shanghai. When entering our country's territorial waters, it changes to the Chinese national flag.</p>

<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Japan's plotting against China is becoming increasingly active. Judging from the two statements issued by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the discussions of its foreign representatives, its ambitions to invade China, no matter how sophistically defended, are exposed without a doubt. The Far East News Agency reporter learned from extremely reliable sources in recent days that the Japanese have recently sent a large number of secret agents to spread across the Beijing and Shanghai area to spy on our country's military, political, and economic situations. These secret agents are directly subordinate to its Foreign Province or Land Province, or indirectly belong to the Japanese Embassy or stationed Japanese troops. The organization is tight and the activities are nimble. The representative of the information department of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Yai Yingyi, when meeting with reporters on the 26th of last month, arrogantly said, "This place (referring to the embassy) always gets information about various measures of your country's government, especially those related to Japan." Yai's words are more than enough to prove the reliability of the above news. Japan's invasion of China has gone a step further, from wild words to preliminary actions.</p>

<p>Mr. Xiang Songmao, a figure in the business community, participated in the national salvation movement after the September 18th Incident and was envied by the Japanese. He was brutally killed by the enemy during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, and his remains have not been found. His family will dress his clothes as his body and hold a memorial service at the Siming Guild Hall on Minquan Road today. Mr. Xiang's death is not only a misfortune for our country's business community, but also a sacrifice for the country, worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Xiang Songmao, the Executive Committee Member of the Chamber of Commerce and General Manager of Wuzhou Pharmacy, died in the January 28th battle. As his remains could not be found, his family specially built a clothing grave and held a memorial service to receive condolences. All the executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will hold a public memorial service at 2:00 PM today. The memorial text reads: "We, on January 31st of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Member Mr. Xiang Songmao was captured by the enemy and died unyielding. The tragic news has been confirmed, but the remains have not been found. According to national legal codes, a missing person cannot be mourned and memorial ceremonies cannot be held before the statutory time period.
