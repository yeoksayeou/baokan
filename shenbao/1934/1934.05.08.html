<h3>時評　英日商戰與我國</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>本月三日。英國當局因感於英日會商日方態度過於倔强遂以哀的美敦書性質之牒文。面交駐英日使松平。内容據路透社探悉大約爲若干具體提議。要求日方圓滿答覆。如日本不卽改變態度英國便將實施必要的自衛手段。排斥日貨。同時又聞英國政府將於本月十六日照會日方在一年以内取消日本與英屬西非間商約之說。據此以觀。英國取締日貨肆行傾銷於英帝國市塲之政策。顯然已經轉入堅决行動之方向雖其取締項目。除棉織物及人造絲外。尙未發表。恐有牽連一切日貨之可能日本果將何以講求其對策姑不具論。然其對策無論爲妥恊的（卽放棄業英傾銷）抑或强硬的（卽取締英帝國各部原料品之輸入）皆足影響日本業華策。使之發生極大之轉變。則可斷言者也。</p>
<p>在今日世界經濟恐慌之中。日本堪稱經濟力量最爲强固之一國其故一則由於七業生產組織能澈底合理化。二則由於國内工人生活水凖能極度緊縮。三則由於日匯低落。無形中使日貨之競爭力加强有此三大原因遂能於世界厲行關稅政策及累施排日運動的情勢之下。依然有恃無恐。在各國市塲發揮極優越之傾銷運動。今若英國爲保護世界棉業王國之權威起見。寗願犧牲其重要領地如加拿大澳洲印度等之對日原料輸出。而决定其排斥日貨之政策。則英日經濟戰之深刻化。勢將無可避免。據日昨哈瓦斯電傳。印澳等雖願完全同情於倫敦政府之强硬政策。然應否追踵母國之後。採取同一立塲。尙在躊躇之中。日本卽在此躊躇期。間利用英方弱點積極吉養其勢力。加强其侵略。使倫敦政府陷於進退維谷之中不得已乃有堅决對日之表示焉。</p>
<p>今就日本以本以言。舍施行對英報復手段外。必將極力向世界其他市塲發展其勢力。而抵力最爲薄弱之吾國市塲。尤將爲日貨加緊傾銷之尾閭。一則日本必於吾國各重要都市。格外講求商品推銷與資本移殖之法。二則必於五國固有之原料市塲。更加重視而利用之。以今日日本對華經關係之密接及此後日本在華工商業直接投資之擴張。日本在長江流域及華南各地之金融資本勢力。亦必將較前有更進一步之躍進。甚至足以動搖英美各國在華金融資本之優越覇權。亦非絕不可能。試觀日本自四一七宣方而後一方積極從事於華北靑滬各埠經濟事業之佈置。一方擬在臺灣召開對岸領事會議。以謀華南經濟及政治勢力之發展。是則日英經濟戰爭之範圍。將自不列顚帝國而波及遠東。亦非不可想像者也。</p>
<p>美國務卿赫爾嘗曰「過去十年來。大好光陰。幾皆消磨於各國商戰聲中。吾人猶欲求武裝方面之和平。直愚族耳。」今英日商戰旣放於肉薄之時期矣。其影響於遠東政局之重大。又意中事也。我國民當此國家經濟　微之時。列强競爭日烈之會。果將任令若輩之肆力蹂躪歟。抑將奮起以圖存歟二者何去何從。當在國民之自擇矣。</p>

<h3>美銀案可望通過國會　銀派再與羅斯福會議</h3>

<h3>戰債問題　又引起一般推測</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）司法部長克明士昨有英國照付一部份戰債、表示信用、故與瓊森議案下所稱不履行債務者不同之斷定、而羅總統復有在半月内將以關于戰債的咨文送交國會之傳說、故戰債問題現又引起一般推測、外交方面認司法部長之斷定極有益于英國、此事現有重新談判、以圖解决之迴翔餘地、傳聞英國現正作外交上磋商、擬於六月十五日戰債到期日再繳一筆表示信用之付欵、而附以此後續作最後解决之談判之諒解、但此說尙未經當塲證實也、衆料羅總統至國會之咨文、將贊成對于芬蘭戰債之解决、卽放棄今後子金、而於五十年中收回債本、至於已收付欵、則予以特别低利是也、華盛頓觀察時事者以爲美國對英亦將有此同樣辦法、但英使署對于此說不願發表意見、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>— 立齋自南寗發</p>
<p>三·沙塘倉庫　其目的在逐步發展、結成區内之農業倉庫網、以調節全區糧食之數量與價格、主要業務、在於受區内農民之請託、爲之保管農產品（暫不收費·）並可對民負代爲加工·包裝·介紹·或經乎·運送·及售賣·對請託者放欵等責任、總計去年由農民委託及爲試辦區保管之毅米、約三百四十餘石、</p>
<p>四·中心農塲其發展計劃、係先從沙塘開始、以後次第在　塘·沙埔·洛垢·柳城·柳州·等處、設立中心農塲、積五年十年之努力、使之逐漸轉變成爲農民自已經營之土地、利用恊作社或集體農塲、沙塘中心農塲、創辦已歷年半、墾種之成績不佳、因規模太小故也、墾殖水利試辦區、兩年來最重要之進行、厥爲</p>
<p>移民墾荒一項拋伍主任所談、試辦區内、地多可耕、而盡荒蕪、爲内地所僅見、試辦區於過去兩年間所墾荒地達五千畝、本年度因激增由北流容縣岑溪等處移來之移民二千人（約五百戶）、墾地可增至一萬五千畝、該區辦理此批移、民共用七萬元、因此種移民、幾盡屬貧無立鈇錐之貧農、舉凡遷徙·住宅·農具·耕牛·等、均係由試辦區貸資、並指導其建築與置、封於春秋兩季之收穫、試辦區則按三七比率收租（卽區得三成、農民得七成、）收穫時之衡量與集中、由事務所派人監督或經理之、至試辦區所得之三成公租、則除代農民償付債息·繳納錢糧捐稅·外以其餘欵作擴大試辦區各項事業之用、去年天旱、故農民收成與公租繳納、均受影響、計試辦區所收之公租、爲現金六百餘元、租穀九百七十七石、以地推算、則農民之收穫總量、約在四千石左右、現該區有火犁機六架、係數年前廣西機械廠所備而未用者、此外、試辦區已於沙塘附近、劃定若干處建築、</p>
<p>新村使農民住宅之形式戶口之疏密、均依一定之設計進行、預計每一新村、均劃出若干田畝作爲該村農民義務種植之「公田、」公田之收入、則以之作爲辦理託兒所及學校之用、因就該區農民之生活概况言、遇生殖繁旺之農家、若以一夫一妻計之、則一戶農民之生產力、只等於半個人、蓋生育兒童達兩個以上、往往除占去農婦之整個精力於保抱撫育外、尙須占去其丈夫之若干時間也、故爲增高農民之生產效率與加强社會對農村兒音之保育起見、託兒所之創辦、在該區實爲刻不容緩之舉、</p>
<p>敎育問題再者、因移民之實施、與區内農戶之增加、亦隨試辦區事業之邁進而日趨於嚴重、據伍廷颺氏之意見、在中國目前窮於羅掘、徒尙形式之敎育狀况下、多辦一學校、卽等於爲人民多添兩種苛捐雜稅之擔負、多有一批畢業學生、卽等於爲社會多添一批寄生分子、試辦區敎育事業之原則、均係針對現行敎育制度之積弊而擬定、故對於敎育經費、則取之於公田、决不直接要農民出錢、所辦之學校、亦擬特别採取需要的、實用的、行動的之精神、對於成年農民、更擬專從農業常識、公民常識墾荒改良種植之方法等方面、施以「一面做、一面學」之實騐的敎育、並擬不採限期畢業之方式、對於在區内服務之敎職員、務求其生活之安定與服務時間之恒久、並擬劃出數百畝田地作敎員學生之實騐農塲、逐漸達到學校本身生產可以自給之目的、現已於事務所之附近建築校舍、及半西式北平式之敎員宿舍數所、預計暑假以後、卽可開學云、最後吾人當加以注意者、卽試辦區之</p>
<p>主要農產品該區除於低濕得水處種植稻穀與甘蔗外（、花生豆麥之種植量甚少）其餘荒山荒地、面積遼闊、現於種植上最注意者、計有兩點其一、種蔗之改良與推廣、柳江爲著名之產蔗區、製糖向用土法、而銷路則僅及湖南貴州</p>
<p>帶、因交通不便與色澤不潔、尙不能與機榶競爭、試辦區頗重視此點、藉技衛之改良與關壁之保護、謀柳江區糖蔗量之自給現已聘有台灣技乎三人、先就沙塘石碑、無休三大農塲、試種台灣大莖種、期於三年内擴爲若干萬畝進而推廣於柳江全區、其二、爲澱粉木薯之大量種植、因一方面爲求廣大荒地在一年内易於收穫、能向省外換取現金、並能使土地鬆肥、便於其他種植者、以木薯爲最適宜另一方面、上海等處紗布廠所用之木薯澱粉、向係由日人自南洋販來、近年來路减少、故該區若能於木薯之種植與製粉上努力發展、大可於上海一帶、獲得市塲也、上述兩大進行之重要關鍵、乃在製糖與製粉之機器加工問題、除廣西當局與該區之積極等劃外、並擬以最優惠之條件歡迎外間之投資也、</p>

<h3>桂林</h3>
<p>桂林不但山水奇秀、與遊覽者以目「不暇給之印象、且昔時爲省會所在、蔚萃人文、爲全省文化之中心、惟自省府遷邕以來、因政治重心之轉移、使桂林之重要性不無削弱、且屢値用兵、地方元氣頗受斵喪、更加之以連年全國不景氣之襲來與農材之破產、於是桂林經濟之衰落與老百姓生計之困難、迄今已達極點、社會生活程度之低、爲長江一帶所無、（桂鈔六元丨合大洋四元二丨可供一人一月之火食、雞蛋每毫六枚）年來桂省當局及各界、頗不乏主張劃桂爲文化區及遊覽區者、以桂林之歷史與地理言、當然具備此種條件、但地方疲敝已久、非經充分之努力、與較長時間之環境的安定、尙談不到也、記者在桂林勾留凡一星期、其時間則强半消磨於奇山秀水之遊覽、至參觀訪問之所及、應爲讀者介紹者、爲從下面各學校中反映而出之敎育狀况、</p>

<p>軍官眷屬工讀學校此種軍官眷屬學校、實爲廣西軍人萃凝勤儉公忠、婦女生活自立等目標而創造之特色、第四集團軍軍官眷屬工讀學校、在南寗已先設立、而桂林之軍官眷屬工讀學校、則係今年四月有十一日始開學者、校長爲十九師長周祖晃兼任、而以參謀長鄭器光兼敎務長、桂林區民團之指揮官及隊長等則兼訓育事務各主任、其他職敎員則半由師部官佐義務兼任半由公開考選而來學生約二百人均係十九師與桂林區民團各級官佐之夫人、至各官佐这姊妹女兒、則因現方草創範圍不大、未能一概容納、學生之程度最爲不齊不識字者約十分之六、而識字者之中、又有高中畢業、初中·小學·各級程度之參差、現分甲乙丙丁四班、第週授課約二十六小時、學科之中、以縫袵國文二門最爲着重、家政與公民次之、該校最大之别點有二、一爲待遇之一律、由師長副師長之夫人以迄排長凖尉官之太太、均須一概入校受課、一律着布衫布裙、受學校一切規律之約束、二爲間接的懲罰制度學生遲到一小時、則由學校通知其丈夫所屬部隊之軍需處、扣薪金二角、屢加勸懲而猶玩忽者、則或由所屬長官對其丈夫加以申斥、或驅逐本人離開桂林、故開學雖不久、而全样紀律之整肅與敎學之認眞、絕不在其他學校之下也、</p>

<h3>龔氏遺書一字一淚</h3>
<p>理齋夫人之從弟龔寳强（名祥霖、濟南上海商業儲蓄銀行經理）先生、送來理齋夫人親筆遺書一通、囑爲發表、書内述死志决定之經過、見解甚透澈、但亦太慘矣、原文抄錄如下、</p>
<p>理齋君乎、君竟死矣、此後歡樂誰與共、憂患誰與謀、疑難誰與决、取捨誰與定、我正如離羣之羊、無舵之舟、茫茫然莫知所届、君昔嘗謂我死、君不能獨生、豈君死而我能獨生耶、而君竟捨我而死也、</p>
<p>憶九一八消息到滬之日、君自報館回、慘沮不可名狀、竟夕不寐、翌晨、亦不進食、旋語予、國事若斯、吾輩已無能爲力、何必爲亡國奴、與兒女同駕一小舟、駛至江心、破舟底、聽其沉没可乎、予不可、謂吾輩爲智識階級中最高者、國事至此、更當益自努力、縱不能挽既倒狂瀾、亦未嘗不能稍留元氣、烏可一受剌激、卽效匹夫之諒、君固一時憤慨之語、此後亦不再提、今則深悔當時不實行君言而同死也、</p>
<p>理齋君、我日前决意與兒輩同死、今又變其宗旨矣、君所遺僅此三人、而三人者君固嘗謂其盡可造之才、我當盡我能力敎之誨之、使之開燦爛之花、結光明之果、以光大其門戶、則君之一生辛苦爲不虚、我思此實爲我不可推諉之責、此責未盡、我不可死、一人固不應死、更不應與兒女同死、我意决定、望君默佑、</p>
<p>理齋君乎、君有所求、胡不告我而以告他人、且謂我宜居錫、若果是何居心、回錫必離去此屋、此屋自頂下以來、我兩人經之營之、費不知幾許心血、電鈴信箱、且均出自吾兩人之手、室中一切、無一非君手置、回錫則一一均將拆散、不啻又死一君、我何以堪、君既死矣、我視此室中無一非君點點之血、我寗死此室内、實不忍舍而他去、君必知我心、彼等所請到者、必係他鬼冒君之名、然乎、君盍告我、</p>
<p>我既生當謀經濟之解决、君辛苦所遺、除去喪費、現尙餘二千元弱、喪分送下一千元强、兩共三千元、子金年可二百四十元、申報月允津貼二十元、以三年爲期、是每月有四十元之經費、苟房屋不致久空、則日常開支、可以敷衍得過、如希能考取奬學金、端玒能弄得免費額、則暫可解决矣、</p>
<p>君生平不欲有求於人、我亦如之、是以平居極力撙節、而今仍不幸至是、實至前心、報館方面、計卹金五百元、史賻一百元、同人五百八十餘元、又三年津貼、計共七百二十元、統計一千九百、其中二百元、可視爲尋常酬酢、至其餘則完全帮助性質、俟端成立、當令添足二千之數、捐還報館、至君所遺、則君嘗有志辦一小小化學實騐室、設兒輩能繼君志、當以此作基金、不然、亦當以君之名義捐入任何學校實騐室、以爲君永久之紀念、昨夜希夢黑</p>
<p>死、君殆知大戰之不能免、故令予等死乎、舅有小兒女、姑有兩妹、薄產尙不致凍餒、我等生無所益、徒令二老煩心、誠生不如死矣、理齋君、我之計畫、恐未必能成、卽幸而能成、君能死、又誰能保兒輩之必不死、設兒輩不幸而喪其一、則我將何以堪、無已、禱於神、請明示我、吾决與兒女同死、可憐哉、此天眞活潑之珏、亦令同死、然我愛之甚、益不忍捨彼而死也、</p>
<p>嗟夫理齋君、君嘗謂今之世界、好種不留、我則嘗謂與其頑劣而存、毋寗優良而絕、合我兩人之言、以占未來、則君之一支固必絕無疑、天意人事、已明著矣、我何必逆水行舟哉、</p>
<p>理齋君、同死之意、實出自君、眞令我受苦不少、然而實爲我之大幸、不然者、我或爲兒女所牽而不忍死也、</p>
<p>君之遺著、我本擬於死前整理就緒、但我一睹君之筆跡、輒心如刀割、遂擱置不動、今我已决定五號死、勢不能顧及、誠憾事、然實無可如何、願君恕我也、</p>
<p>我每思及我等死後之慘狀、幾欲自變其宗旨、以是遲遲至今日而始實行、蓋不知費却幾許躊躇、而終不能自制、則命也、願舅姑勿悲痛、須知人固不能與命爭也、我日夕祈禱能不演此慘劇、而終不可得、臨死心痛如割、自覺實不應與兒女同死然理齋起意於前、而兒等又不肯離我、我亦不能舍兒輩、竟成騎虎、我因是欲自殺而又止者、已十餘次、亦曾决計放棄此自殺之心、而努力做去、但我之吐血肺病、實足令我氣餒、自思遲早不免一死、笑駡只可由人矣、</p>
<p>世上有不少的佩絲、安詳而羞怯、屏息退處、非至不得已時、不肯露頭面、以輔助他人爲事、而人不見其努力與犧牲、直到牖下寒蟲、一旦吟罷、愛日西沉、光輝頓杳、祇留下一片寂靜、供人間之憑弔而已、（見小婦人）</p>
<p>此豈非爲理齋寫照乎、然此種行爲、宜於女子、不宜於男子、尤不宜於今之世、於是乎理齋遂死於盲目之犧牲、天實爲之、謂之何哉、</p>
<p>書兩包、系希孫還吳學芬者（在淵之女）、别人如不認得、或請肇美送去、</p>
<p>我等尸身、可仍至錫金公所殯殮、一切可省事些、檯燈可還健弟、</p>

<h3>龍華寺廟產糾紛涉訟　性空訴請確認合同無效　兩被告到庭供建屋經過　本案改期十四天後再審</h3>
<p>本邑西鄕龍華古刹、爲東吳赤烏欽建、上海最古最巨之叢林也、三月香汛、江南士女雲集、盛况不亞天竺、現經佛敎會收回管理、選派四川峨嵋高僧性空住持、本年來滬、滬人士乃有復興龍華之圖、寺產須淸理查點、遂致發生訟累、</p>
<h3>借欵建屋</h3>
<p>先是龍華寺於民國七年起、由浙江寗海籍僧元照住持、於上年始更易、在經過期間中、先則軍閥鬭爭、軍隊盤踞、致香客却步、利益缺乏、繼則市面蕭條、興修需資、於民國十三年、遂擬在寺前一大空塲之上建築市房七十六間、俾收取租金、以增寺產、無如經濟短絀、乃向同鄕人胡蘇記卽胡則誠、借洋一萬七千五百元、向寗海山中購料運滬、方告厥成、當時向胡立有定期之借據、嗣以一時無此鉅數的欵歸趙、乃將房屋作歸於胡蘇記所有、元照則退爲地主、由胡年納地租二百元爲寺有、須至廿二年（扣至民國四十年）後始將房地仍歸於寺、</p>
<h3>合同可疑</h3>
<p>是以性空僧住持後、認此項寺產、被前任住持等所損害應得利益收回、而取銷租地之合同、故延潘振聲袁希濂兩律師在地方法院民庭訴請確認合同無效、列共同被告爲僧元照及胡蘇記、舉該處地保計祝康爲證人、指七十六間房屋爲當時營房所改造、而胡蘇記者爲元照所雇之書傭、依寺生活者、指摘其合同有不盡不實之處、經法院通知被告答辯後、胡蘇記延陳文照律師抗辯、謂胡乃浙江公立法專卒業、在政法兩界均任顯職、安得指爲下流、並提出合同爲證、昨日下午四時、地方法院傅訊、推事汪潤在第二法庭審理、原告性空未到、由潘振聲律師代理到庭、</p>
<h3>携欵避匿</h3>
<p>陳述原告年七十二歲、四川峨嵋山人、龍華寺住持、緣前住持元照、於民國二十二年十月間、携帶寺廟公欵、避匿無踪、節經地方各公團呈請上海市政府查究、因元照住址未明、迄未到案、其時寺廟乏人住持、由上海佛敎公會選任原告爲龍華寺住持於二十二年十一月七日到廟接事、内部紛亂、正在從事整理、而寺產房屋、因收租忽起訴訟、因而發見收租人胡蘇記在法庭呈案之抵押管理收租合同據查得該項合同據、係爲被告僧元照與被告胡蘇記互相串合僞造、今將其虚僞違法各點述明、</p>
<h3>契約無效</h3>
<p>（一）虚僞者、查抵押合同上首卽謂前因龍華寺之欵建造馬路一帶房屋、但馬路一帶房屋、寺前東首平房二十一間、于民十三年將寺西營房拆卸改建又寺前西首平房十九間、於十五年間亦將營房拆建寺前路南平房十五間、於十七年將南營房拆改者、其他均爲陸續修改、而成今日之狀態、故無須舉借鉅額借欵、當爲串合僞造侵害公產、又胡蘇記者於訴追欠租案内到庭、爲當地市民所共見、此人係前住持僧元照之僱傭、何來鉅欵出借故輿論大譁、咸願爲證（二）法律者、查被告等僞造抵押契約在民國十八年七月、其時監督寺廟條例尙未公布施行、茲依司法院十八年五月四日公布院字八一號解釋、寺廟住持於未公布寺廟管理條例以前廟產典當與人、依舊條例（民國四年公佈、十年修正管理寺廟條例、）其法律行爲仍屬無效、是則元照與胡蘇記所訂之抵押契約不問　僞、均屬無效且自招無效、原告一爲保全廟產尊重法律計、並念吾佛慈悲、姑暫保留刑訴、而從民事請求、確認契約無效云云、</p>
<h3>朋友關係</h3>
<p>至此胡蘇記供、字則誠、年四十四歲在民國十三年間、前龍華寺住持僧元照、因建造該寺前市房、在寗悔海原籍購辦木料甚多、需欵孔亟、、託借洋一萬七千五百元、言明本市王家碼頭和興里恊興順柴炭行内交付、並由元照出具憑條一紙、訂五年内爲淸償期限、年息、一分、有鄕友章春甫章培甫二人在塲目覩、現僅春甫逝世、然培甫可證、惟我與元照爲總角交、純爲朋友關係、元照昔曾爲寗海福全寺主持、距我家不遠、常相往來、我自民國二年卒業於浙江公立法專、嗣因借欵逾期不還、不得已改訂租地造屋之約、曾親往收租數次、元照以地主之誼伴同前往、焉能指爲僱傭、顯屬誣衊而租地造屋之契、爲二十二年滿期、房地歸寺其本利不必償還、而每年反納地租　百元、亦爲該寺增多利益、並無損害、與典當辦法不同、不適用寺廟條例之規定、請爲駁斥云云、</p>
<h3>調理淸楚</h3>

<h3>讀書消息申報流通圖書館指導部編第八期錄目（一）小前言（二）本週情報三則（三）信箱四通　小前言</h3>
<p>近來從來信中，我們已看出我們的讀書生活已推進了一步了。「讀書問答」内現在居然登出「讀勞働問題季刋後的質疑」，「中國新文學運動史資料讀後的疑問」這類的文字，這是很可喜的現象。這已不是純粹理論的研究，而進入更現實的理論的理解了。</p>
<p>以前有許多讀者間我們，要求我們替他解决讀雜誌報紙中所發生的困難，我们雖然一一作覆了，但到現在想來，就這類覆信說也是應在報上公佈的。因爲這是一般的要求，讀雜誌報紙的人一定要比專門書籍的多、所以更應公開答覆。</p>
<p>對於書籍的介紹和批評現在誠是刻不容緩了。我們收到探問「某書内客如何」的來件要佔其他來信的絕對多數。自然，這書工作不是我們幾個人可作得了的，但現在文化界既少有人做，於是我們不能不出來負些責任。所以今後的「讀書問答」應着事實的要求，恐怕一天天要偏向這一方向了罷！無疑地，我們認爲這是進步的現象。</p>
<p>因此，我們希望本館全體的讀者，大家動員起來，將自己所讀的書（不問任何性質的）中發現的一切不滿和錯誤處，一一指出，寄交本部，藉作參考，同是還望社會上與我們同興趣的朋友，供給我們一些出版界消息及書報評判。</p>
<p>我們亟希望大家能注意當前一切流行的刋物中的理論及一切關於實際問題的書籍，不過，同時要自己有理論，有眼力，要以批判的眼光來讀它。</p>
<p>至於，最近來信中另一部分的現象，是讀者提出的問題更具體了。我們也盼望讀者提出的部題，在原則上總要帶點討論性質的爲好，如係新名詞，新術語則可自己查新術語辭典，如果查後還不懂則再寫信來。關於介紹外國文原著，我們暫時實在没有那樣的時間，現在决定除開翻譯方面問題我們可以代查原著外，以後其他詢問擬暫不作答。</p>
<h3>本週情報（一）讀書會消息</h3>
<p>贊成組織讀書會的讀者已不少，收到贊成的來信我們都一一登記。自然，現在還談不到會務的進行。讀者的建議雖多，但極可供大家參考的有下列二項：（甲）用社會科學演講，文學演講的方式去團結而同興趣的讀者，組織某某科學研究班，但演講的人要有眞實學問，不專在名上。（乙）不必舉行大會的形式，祇舉行某某科學研究班的登記就是了。我們没有成見，就是以上的意見仍由大家公决。</p>
<h3>（二）出版消息</h3>
<p>一，讀書問答「集第一集已於本月五日出版了。承讀者的愛護，五日那一天本報發行部的門市就賣出六百册了。外埠來信整批預定的也非常的踴躍，本部决定仍維持以前的原則，先儘在本埠銷售，外埠祗於本館有分館的地方纔寄出數十本樣本。一俟賣罄，卽行再版。但第一版中，因印刷不精，其中仍不免有許多錯誤，最大的錯誤，如一六二面第六行括孤内「實在是依夷制夷」，误爲「以夷制夷」這頗會引人誤解；再，九四面倒數第一行未完，還掉一字在九五面上，也很不方便。其他標點排錯更指不勝指。這是非常抱歉的一件事。</p>
<p>二，怎樣自學社會科學？上篇已二校，下篇亦在初校中。全書約三萬餘字，凖十二日出版。</p>
<h3>（三）店員作家消息</h3>
<p>本部讀者吳鶴生君的文學作品一篇經本部介紹「每月文學月報」，已經登出。該刋凖於日内出版。</p>
<h3>信箱</h3>
<p>一，本部不接收預定「讀書問答」，自學叢書的信件，滙欵。本部出版一切讀物，發行全責全歸本報特種發行部。以後凡關於訂書部分的事務請卽直接寄該部。</p>
<p>二，催缴讀書生活調查表！凡未繳來者限十五日前繳齊，過期不收。</p>
<p>三，歡迎讀者及關心我們工作的朋友們對於讀書問答集第一集的批評。凡關於批評的來信，請於信封上書名批評讀書問答集，信内不要談其他别的事。</p>
<p>四，吳鶴生，王紀新，李田，郭梅生諸君，你們老是忘記或不將通訊處詳細示知，使我們無從直接通信，望以後加以注意。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這一輛專供隨駕大臣們　息的車輛的車身上，爲着要這使它不至和那一輛專載鐵路官員的車輛　混起見，在左右兩面，都懸着一塊牌子，很顯明地寫着「内務府」三個大字。所謂内務府，就是等於現在的内政部。除掉這輛内務府專車之外，旁的車上，也都有各各不同的牌子懸着，標明是給什麽人坐的，或是裝載什麽東西的以免大家走錯，可是太后的一輛車上，當然是不能掛什麽牌子的，不過也有一個特殊的記號，就是兩邊各漆着一條張牙舞爪的巨龍，那是用天藍色漆的，配着金黃色的車身，眞是非常的動人。</p>
<p>這些大臣都以爲自己的位置是很重要的，在外邊人的面前，往往十分誇耀。但是我可以很肯定地絕對負責的說，他們的位置，實在是絕不重要的！雖然我的二哥勛齡，也是其中之一，可是我終不能抹殺了事實說假話。論二哥的人品和相貎，的確可以說是很漂亮的，他的服式也不能不算華貴富麗；就是他的學識，如果委任他的人能够用得其當，也不見得會輸給人家。無奈現在他們不但不能盡量的用其所長，並且連尋常的事情，也不讓他做，除掉他的漂亮的相貎，華貴的服式之外，他所能替太后或朝廷效力的，可說是没有了！</p>
<p>慶善就是那位内務府大臣，也就是在表面上負責料理一切關於内務方面的政務的人。他的官銜聽起來是的確很重要的，然而官銜儘是這樣動聽，事實上他的職務，却和我們理想中的景象，剛巧相反。（二八）</p>
<h3>蕪湖出孝子</h3>
<p>— 文俠</p>
<p>蕪湖人眞榮幸，居然出了一個驚天動地的大孝子。上自國府，下到專員，再至士紳以及娼妓，都嘉獎褒揚稱頌跪拜，現在孝子溺的尿拉的糞，都成爲</p>
<p>仙丹了，眞是可賀可慶！</p>
<p>孝子出在蕪湖北鄕十五里地方白馬山下，姓滕，名慶有，年三十六歲，亂髮披至膝下，他的父母不知在那年陸續死了，據說孝子把老婆賣了八十塊錢作棺殮費，把兩口棺材併在一起，造了一個土牆草頂高不滿四尺墳屋兩不像的墓廬。孝子同兩口棺材都擠在裏面，放了一個數寸見方的小洞，因爲孝子功行還没有圓滿，烟火食仍舊是要吃的，預備給人送飯進來，另外地下一個小孔通到外面，作爲孝子拉料的處所。四月二十二日，是孝子出廬大典的黃道日，據說孝子守墓已經三年六個月了。規定的孝子成功老章程，不能增多减少，專員派有代表，紳士是天職所在，還有好奇和同情者成千成萬，一樣的升砲奏樂演說同就職大典一點不含糊，所以有人定名孝子成名就職大典。並有花枝招展女人赤脚燒肉香，拜伏在孝子之前，因爲孝子成名之後，只除没有飛昇，已經等於地仙了。所以孝子穿的腐爛的蔴衣，墓廬上的稻草，燒的香灰，溺尿拉屎地方的泥土，都被人搶着撕去掘走，說是可以治百病，甚至有使寡婦生兒子做功效。孝子本身已獲到偉大的成功，有國民政府頒給的「孝思不匱」匾額，有高大的生祠，有優厚的物質贈予供奉，其他官紳是仁政澤施，乃有孝子出現，合邑的人民，是永無災難。啊！偉大的孝子，誰說不値得膜拜傳頌呢？不過有一層，還是我大中國國運不濟，可惜這樣的孝子，只就蕪湖出了這麽一個，那一個没有父母？那個父母會永世不死？最好凡有做兒子資格的人，將來都去做孝子，我想二萬萬男孝子成功以後，雖然一齊在墓廬裏合十打坐，不事生產，自然還有二萬萬女孝婦送飯把我們吃，或者日本人也會送啤酒把我們喝呢？</p>
<h3>芳隣小誌</h3>
<p>— 趙鵑秋</p>
<p>隔隣爲粤南人居，其二樓亭子間，别賃一江都女郎，其芳蹤似頗詭秘，出恒暮夜，歸則在在晨曦中，當叩門聲作，輒擾我淸夢，家人胥鄙視之。謂此女郎沉浸都市夜生活中，殆必若西方故事所述之「凡派亞」也者，愚亦以爲然，因作好奇，謀刺探其夜何所在？顧久而不得，旋亦漠然置之。</p>
<p>一夕，愚從友人遊，入ＸＸ舞塲，對座一舞孃，正隣家女也。遂以告友人，進而通欵曲，與之舞，姿態曼妙，滋可人意，叩其芳名，則郁慧鵑是。久之，愚與慧鵑稔，慧鵑亦漸以身世相告，輒欷歔不置，蓋已飽經世變者矣。其言曰：「良人者，奚可仰望而終身，女子未嫁時，固猶一林鳥，自由自在，及其既嫁，則鳳凰在笯，其幸者，以一玩物以自安，不幸者，磨折以自斃，儂於十六歲聘於包姓，且論嫁娶矣，然繼以一念之差，見誘於一傳粉何郎，郎薄倖，始亂終棄，忍心捨儂而去，不得已儂遂他適，然而命途多舛，益有遇人不淑之嘆。不久復賦仳離，轉輾淪胥，今乃操舞業，非所願也，不得已耳。」其事固平庸無足奇，然而紅顏命薄，今古同悲，彼燈紅酒綠塲中，縱極玉笑珠香之樂，而滿袖啼痕，或儘多背人彈淚者在也。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十八回　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書</p>
<p>積之將手微微擺了兩擺道：不要緊的，找些生薑胡椒冲碗水喝就是了厚之兩隻手在相搓着，除了這樣辦，也没有第二個辦法，於是坐在積之書房裏，看到聽差，將薑湯湯送來，伺候積之喝下了，替他重重的蓋着被，方始走去。積之到了這時，心裏才明白過來，並非什麽相思病，乃是受了重性感冒。至於受感冒的原因，必是由熱屋子裏出去以後，沿街看春聯受冷所致，這也就决牽涉不到楊桂枝身上去了。他這時候，燒熱得更厲害，腦筋昏昏沉沉的，也不想到别的事情上去，昏然的就睡着了。他這樣一睡，足有十幾小時，待他完全淸醒過來，已是太陽高照，在窗户紙上了。他到了這時，腦筋淸楚了，才慢慢的回想到未病倒以前的事情上去。在不曾睡下的時候，曾拿着一條拾來的手絹，在燈下把玩，這方手絹，在自己急於要上床睡覺，不曾理會到，放在那裏，現在就記不起來了。若是在燈下賞玩這手絹的，必然是隨手放在桌上，没有收起來。那末，哥哥到這房裏來探病的時候，他就看到那方手絹了。那手絹上，不但有香氣，而且還挑了花，顯然是女子的東西，雖然，那上面没有楊桂枝三個字，但是有了女子的手絹在手上，便不是一件端莊的事，哥嫂得了這條手絹，不又不免要猜疑一番了。他猜不出是桂枝手絹，那還罷了，若是猜了出來，人家是有夫之婦了，這不顯得自己是不安分嗎？（三七九）</p>

<p>在每一個學校附近，總有些飯舖，洗衣作，烟紙店，小吃館等設立，大學最多，中學次之，自然，這裏做的光是學生生意，賺的盡是學生的錢，老　娘老是笑口常開，以爲學生的錢，是容易賺，學生的竹槓，容易敲，同時也有着同樣地反感。</p>
<p>雖然，他們的設備，不必怎樣講究，但總是出出進進常患客滿，理由不外「馬虎」是中國人的通病，近得「地利」罷了，假使再進一步，設到學校裏面去反要門可羅雀，關門大吉，學生不喜歡在校内吃飯，買東西，據說理由很多。</p>
<p>不記賬凖没人來這是老閶的苦菜不好吃出蟲來，堂倌活該倒霉，襯衣西裝拿來了，不幸呌這般公子哥兒發現燙得不好，洗得不乾凈，茶房凖要挨駡，向例是不分「責任」和「界限」的，這是學生生</p>

<h3>追悼比王亞爾培</h3>
<p>— 寒自比京寄</p>
<p>亞爾培王長逝矣，偉大哉，亞爾培王！遠如東亞，亦爲震悼不已！</p>
<p>今晨走訪中國駐比公使兼代表中國國民政府主席參加葬禮之張乃燕博士，茲錄其談話如次：</p>
<p>余之印象殊深。當一九一四年，大禍襲至之時，余適留學歐洲。貴國國王之演辭，一似狂風暴雨中之閃電，滿照全天。其詞曰：</p>
<p>「余以手足之情誼，致敬於堅决保衛祖國瀕危之靑年。······勇敢與團結爲全比人民不可缺少之德行。苟有人焉，敢犯吾比利時之寸土尺地，則全比人民將立卽聽命於其永不背誓之元首。······余深信凡一自衛之國家，當得舉世之敬重。此國家决不淘汰也。······」</p>
<p>當時，余誦其言，頗爲感動，繼而亞爾培王束裝從戎，與士卒共生活。法政府嘗邀往，王辭謝之，願守最後寸土尺地。一如王與疆土，不能分離者然。王卒於一九一八年在弗郎特下令反攻，舉全失地而光復之。</p>
<p>時余在歐洲，所聞如身入其境。一九一九年余歸國而撰世界大戰全史於一九二三年在上海出版。亞爾培王不朽之功勳。亦皆筆之於書，敝國人民亦得以景仰焉。</p>
<p>然而此君主，爲余素所欽佩者，余固未嘗一識其豐采也。</p>
<p>大戰告終後之十五年。余奉命爲敝國之駐比公使。適於一月前呈掳國書，獲覲見。方冀從此常瞻儀容，不圖王竟遽爾長逝也。</p>
<p>從此，亞爾培王留芳千秋。其偉大之事蹟，實爲人類增光；其不朽之紀念，將爲全人類所共有，不僅貴國人民所得而專有，亦不僅歐戰恊約諸國所得而崇拜，卽遠東民族亦均景仰之也。</p>
<p>此外尙有一點，應請注意者。日昨貴國前外交部長樊迪文先生嘗追述王之遺札，稱王對於敝國所深受痛苦之不平等條約，亦深表反對，故敝國對王之言，將永誌不忘也。</p>
<p>嗚呼！貴國人民之創痛深矣！日昨之夜，無名英雄墓旁，民衆之嗚咽失聲，余親聞之，民衆之涕泗滂沱，余亦親睹之。余深知貴國人民之哀痛而欲同哀之。蓋名垂千古之一大偉人，從此離塵世而長逝矣，悲夫！（譯錄巴黎晚報）</p>
<p>意的難做。</p>
<p>愛添菜，好小吃洗衣揩幾個銅元的油，多要些，並不算什麽大不了，學生的錢，得着太容易，敲詐也容易，這是學生的錢容易賺。</p>
<p>所以老閭是介於難易之間，哭笑不得，可是明的了善逢迎，不怕該賬，不怕該駡，東西好，快，這幾個秘訣，錢是滿不在乎，有賺無疑！</p>

<h3>紐約通信第三封兩天不同的「時」記（續）</h3>
<p>— 羅皚嵐</p>
<p>下午</p>
<p>一時上ＸＸ概要課，課後遇Ａ君，告我考博士不難，過聖誕節多送禮物與主任敎授便成。他並舉在國内享盛名之Ｇ博士爲例，說Ｇ的博士是一方繡花桌布，兩罐茶棠換來的。</p>
<p>二時至五時在本系圖書館讀參考書。</p>
<p>六時在大學樓餐館吃中國飯。遇雪萊黃，此人最俗，却取一詩人名字。他帶着一大批老處女，和一隻黑狗，那樣子似乎不可一世，我祗暗中冷笑。</p>
<p>七時歸寓。聽無綫電廣播，有ＲmduyＶolee的音樂，甚佳。</p>
<p>八時Ｒ來，說預備打電話呌妓名Ｒ，因他住在宿舍不便，要借我房一用。我拒絕了，因我怕媽麗闖了來，不方便。</p>
<p>九時Ｒ走了。我寫了幾封信。</p>
<p>十一時上床。星期六上午</p>
<p>十時給電話鈴驚醒，原來是Ｎ打來的，約我晚上八時去他家打麻將，我答應了。</p>
<p>十一時出門，在大學樓餐館吃包子，又遇見雪萊黃，眞倒霉。</p>
<p>十二時歸寓。Ｋ來，勸我加入非非兄弟會，說國内某部長某名人都是會員，加入後，回國不愁無飯碗，我答以容考慮後再說。</p>
<p>下午</p>
<p>一時Ｋ走後，媽麗打電話來，問晚上有工夫否，我答以已有牌局，她約我三時同赴Ｈ旅館的茶舞（ＴeaＤamce）</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>二時去Ｍ百貨公司買零星東西，在化裝品部遇小c的女友Ａ，Ａ爲土生女，在那兒賣香水，小Ｃ要走了，打算棄了她，她不知道，還問我小Ｃ近來怎樣，可憐。</p>
<p>三時在Ｈ旅館門口等媽麗，約十分鐘，她方來。我們吃茶跳舞，人很多，音樂也很好，祇我一人是中國人，别人很注目，我想要不是和媽麗同來，也許就進不了門。　　五時送媽麗回家。</p>
<p>六時在一小電影院看了一個電影。</p>
<p>八時去Ｎ家，他家裏今晚很凌亂，從我認識Ｎ起，他便說要搬家，但至今仍在那裏。打牌的除Ｎ夫婦外，有一呌Ｖ的土生女。Ｎ太太的肺病似乎更深了，有時咳得兩頰通紅，Ｎ似乎不大關心她。這樣一個又聰明又好看的女人，却遇着這樣命運，她比林黛玉還可憐。Ｎ是一個很好的人，爲甚麽對她不知憐惜，也許另有苦衷。</p>
<p>十一時八圈已完，Ｖ要再打四圈，Ｖ的牌藝實不高明，亂放張子，但究竟是女人，我不好拒絕。</p>
<p>十二時打完牌。Ｎ蒸了臘腸臘肉給我們消夜，並約明晚同去中國街吃飯。</p>
<p>這兩天的「時」記，都是一字不易地照抄，人名等等，我却換了。那本子上一共記了四個月又十七天，我那晚上一氣把牠讀完了。「時」記中尙有許多有趣的記錄，可惜不能一一抄出。這部「時」記現仍存我手頭，因此想在這裏登一個不花錢的廣告；如果原主要索還，祇要能有相當的證明，我是願意物歸原主的。</p>
<h3>論女性之解放</h3>
<p>— 地</p>
<p>據優生學的統計，男子壽一百歲，女子壽約一百零五六歲。生物界普通以女性生活力較强：而數量則男性較多，成爲一種自然的選擇而使種類優生，蕃衍。</p>
<p>若干年來已有婦女解放的呼聲了，但一提倡「佛化」，對於婦女運動是一大創·佛家小乘之憎恨女人，大概遠過於現代西洋之憎惡女性者，律宗中抬頭望女人便是罪惡。丨丨那麽引現代人的「邏輯」而引申之吧：夫其旣憎惡之矣，必有可憎可惡之道理也。</p>
<p>但「佛說一切諸法非男非女」，可見佛對於生命的實質，原來不因性别而分高下，天女將舍利弗一下化爲女人，說：「如非女而現女身，一切女人亦復如是，雖現女身而非女也」。再將舍利弗又變回來，問道：「女身色相，今何所在？」舍利弗只得說：「女身色相，無在無不在」。—可見憎恨女性，是未曾認識生命之實質（卽。算是實質無有，便可以「實相一，或實境」，或「原始」，或「本身」解釋之），而不曾懂到人生！</p>
<p>在哲理上將地位爭平了，但在實際上還需要無窮的解放。如果婦女不自求解放，則男子有使之自求解放之必要。但目前不是有婦女運動麽？這些景况頗有不同的，「又當别論」！</p>
<p>女子斥男子不愛國，爲什麽不打仗去呢？國家是男性管理，便這麽弄糟的，隱約以爲女子當政，便要大愛國了。—非也，男性將國家弄不好，女性更不行。這是爲政者的心理。—而實際上女子從來不希望男子去打仗。這倒是弱者代爲想出的「反撲」！</p>
<h3>翰海</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>六「翰海」十二卷，在一部分尺牘後，且附有輯者所加之參閱材料，詩文詞俱備，以作家論，引眉公者爲最多，張侗文，亦有佳作。關於尺牘本身，明以前諸家，以蘇黃爲主，柳宗元八記之一，亦竟被拉入作尺牘論，可是這究竟祗算得小缺點。對於此書，我深感到不快的，是在購得之後，無意中發現坊間已有標點註釋本，不僅書名改爲「古今名人尺牘，」編者沈錫候且被擠出書外，變爲「陳眉公選」，前序二千言，無一字涉及原本，陳序亦被删去，門類由十二變爲四，次序亦大加變動。翻閱之餘，頗疑卽是「翰海」買回校閱後，始肯定地知道並非他本。在尺牘本身，略翻一過，亦笑話百出，如中郎信中所云「二百年云山」竟變成「十年云山，」眞不知「二百」如何能錯作「十。」如李君實，在註釋中竟變成司馬温公，相差又是數百年。全書被删去甚多，甚至一通之中，亦有毫無道理的被删部分。至錯宇，錯標點，斷句錯誤，更是所在多有。翻刻古書，以便學者，自是好事，但如此翻刻，不僅曾經費一番心血之編者死不暝目，後世學子亦將受害無窮。以此看來，舊書肆之抬高書價，作爲古董，眞可謂大有道理矣！</p>

<h3>靑島櫻花會</h3>
<p>— 臧克家</p>
<p>「島國東風春正暖，</p>
<p>櫻花紅過海西來。」</p>
<p>靑島有點春寒。前幾天一個朋友從濟南來信說，他在西上的火車中，一路迎着櫻花開，到了那裏正置花殘。他說要搭車來靑趕櫻花會，我報告他：</p>
<p>「此地櫻花待兄開。」</p>
<p>東風的神力眞不可思議，三天的工夫吹紅了靑島。如果那位朋友這回來到，一定覺得我的前言是近於欺騙。</p>
<p>今天是星期日，今天是跑馬的日子，今天是櫻花會。三重熱閙疊在一起，給終年冷落的第一公園造成了一天紅的記憶。</p>
<p>今天，各色的人穿着各色的衣裳，帶着各色的心一齊朝着一個目的地出發。從衣服上，從走路的憑藉上，可以淸楚的看出各人的身分，汽車，馬車，人力車，步行，這是四個等級，各人最高的表現了自己，在這人像决了堤的水一般的時候，决没有捨了車不坐而淸高閒步的，同時也决没有不把頂得意的服裝穿戴起來的，誰有粉不願搽在臉上呢？</p>
<p>匯泉道上平素撇一塊石頭决不會打着個人的，今天却上海的大馬路也不換。汽車接成一條綫，揚起一道灰土，人低着頭罩在這氣氛中，幾乎對面看不淸人，只聽見汽車的呌聲，馬車的蹄子聲，人力車的鈴　聲。</p>
<p>櫻花路是熱閙的中心，來看花的人没有不在這路上走一趟的。路是南北的，長數足足有一里，從這頭往那頭望，眼光像在人空裏穿梭，往上看，只見櫻花不見天。</p>
<p>在熱閙中看不出神奇來，因了自己的眼已先是一隻熱閙的眼了。頂好檢一個比較僻靜一點的地方，譬如坐在一座亭子角上，或是一個轉彎的路口，這些人人都越不過的地方，這，你可以有暇用冷眼去看每一個人。看他是一個官僚，一個商人，一個紳士，一個學生，或是一個才從鄕下來的莊家漢。看她是一個閨秀，還是一個野雞。這些人的臉上淸楚的刻著各人的身世。看各種姿態閃過你的眼：老頭撚著鬍鬚在草地上喘息；老太太用手杖支持著下傾的身子；雄糾糾的是學生，腰挺得板直，瞧那目空一切的神兒；用低頭掩過嬌羞的不用題是深閨中的佳人了。</p>
<p>小貨攤像從地裏突然冒出來的，一座一座，鬥寳似的各人把最奪目的洋貨（小孩的玩具，女人的首飾···）用最惹人的方法懸掛着，攤子前堆滿了女人和小孩，大都是從鄕下來的，每樣東西她彷彿都喜歡，然而每樣彷彿都太貴。小孩子的眼釘在各種玩具上，用眼向大人要求什麽，回答多半是一個白眼；不過也有許多小孩牽一個輕汽球在閒地上跑。呌賣商的聲像雨後的蛙，噪着人的耳朶，人的心。茶栅裏那四面布圍圈出來的一塊隙地，幾張籐椅，小方桌上羅列着的那一套茶具，無一不足以使倦了的遊人從心理渴慕。這眞合適於幾個意外聚首的朋友談心。</p>
<p>爲了要秩序，臨時添了警察，那有什麽用，新添的監視的眼睛和新添的遊人的比例數是没法開的。你看，禁足的木牌只管立在那裏，草塲上却站滿人了，警察的話在人耳中失了威嚴。</p>
<p>人像要在花下留下自己的靑春，都在爭着照樣·瞧，立起一回，坐下一回，周身不知道如何安排，鼻眼都好似没長在正確的地方，做了又做，把攝影師急得滿臉汗，眞的，在萬目集注的底下是難以爲容的！</p>
<p>最熱閙的一天，熱閙頂點的這一天的正午，在攘攘裏過去了。天氣的熱度也降低了，遊人好似也過了熱癮漸漸地開始撒退。汽車也開始呌了。一道灰塵送遊人散去。</p>
<p>傍晚的候，櫻花路上，殘紅滿地。夕陽染在花瓣上，冷風吹醒了一塲熱夢。</p>
<h3>鄕村掇拾　（五）</h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>如果現在還是三百年前，大概不會有理髮這一種行業吧！</p>
<p>但現在畢竟是現在，男人的髮辦固然不再存留，連女人也非剪去不可了。於是有了理髮這一門行業，說得體面一些，爲蒼生着想，是有功可居的。</p>
<p>近幾年，鄕村女人剪頭髮的也一天天多起來，但從來没有人能講出剪髮的利弊來的。據反對的說，剪了髮像吊死鬼，像無常鬼，像半雌雄。但後來却又沈默下去了。這大概是感於吊死鬼和無常鬼太多了，會影響到人命上去吧！便是太多了半雌雄，也好像不成體統的，所以連這也不再說。至於讚成的呢，那理由可更簡單，據說是因爲從上海回來的女人都剪去的。</p>
<p>這里鄕村的學上海，無疑地是一種共同的趨向，尤其是那些愛時髦的年靑男女。但所學的東西都却很滑稽，卽就服裝一門而論，男人们學得的是流氓裝，女人們學得的是野雞裝。眞純的天性使他們相信這種服裝並不曾影響到自己的人格。如果有誰告訴他們這是流氓野雞的表幟，他們决不相信。　　流氓野雞的服裝能够通行於鄕間，是有他必然的環境的。把才從泥堆裏鑽出來的身體去套上簇新的西裝，這决不是鄕下人所敢希冀；至於上海時髦小姐的服裝，動輒以幾百幾十金計，鄕村女子想積這幾個錢，也許得積蓄一世，也許没世還不足此數。何况時髦小姐隨時更換新花樣，不換花樣也就不時髦。但愛美畢竟是人同此心，學上海也已毫無疑義，於是流氓野雞的服裝就當選了。　　更有使志士們喪氣的地方，便是那些服裝的原料都是洋貨。但這也還有他必然的環境。近年來都市的抵制Ｘ貨，那些没有見效的地方不必說；至於有效的呢，也只效在「只許經過，不許駐足」的八個字上，於是Ｘ貨就經過了「不許駐足」的抵制商埠而湧向鄕村。價格賤，花樣新，又没有「這是Ｘ貨」的呼聲，於是一切都太平地過去。</p>
<p>有誰會駡鄕下人是「冷血動物」的麽？我想：是有的。而且必須是在「只許經過」的抵制商埠裏。</p>
<h3>默念</h3>
<p>— 葉蒼岑</p>
<p>是的，我看得見你們在絕望裹掙扎，是的，我看得見你們在血泊裏求生，幾次地，在黑暗的途中，奔起又倒下，但天空依舊是没一絲兒星影。千萬隻的眼睛火似地向我打顫，從四周又傅來了嘶嗄的悲聲。一轉身，一舉足，都感到這時代的艱難，一好罷，我就担當一份這時代的苦痛！</p>
<h3>山舖票（四）</h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>當然第一樣得把留在鄕下的妻子兒女接出來。自已坐了頭等車回去身上穿了綢的，或是…西裝？……這准會把阿狗的媽嚇了一大跳！（他笑了）。她起初不相信，不過我最後摸出一大疊鈔票給她看，她這才相信了。她要問我是打那兒發來的洋財。我不告訴她，她急了。我偏不告訴她，說：你問什麽，祗要不是偷來搶來的好了。</p>
<p>用嗩呐吹了一套凄凉的粤曲，再從嗩呐裏吹出了「小孩子啊」！「買白欖啊」！兩句逼肖的聲音的賣橄欖的走了過去。</p>
<p>「我想到什麽地方了」？這種大膽的甜夢，活了四十多歲的阿發還是第一次做。眞是愈想愈是心養的。「嗬嗬，是阿蘭的媽，她跟我吃了大半世的苦，這下半世也應該享享福了，我要給她做許多綢衣服，許多許多。阿狗阿金呢，當然也是新衣裳，皮鞋，再帶他們到城裏來進洋學堂······」</p>
<p>又是賣餛飩的敲着竹片，擔了一閃一閃的小石油燈，從他身旁踅了過去。還有挑了擔子，喊着「王老吉菊花茶」的也走過去了。市囂已經低了許多。東邊的火光，也低了下去，淡了下去，身邊躺着的，都已經牛吼也似的打鼾了許久了。可是他依舊睡不着。他翻了一個身，幻想像是蜒蝣似的儘在他心頭黏着，黏着，不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>「回去的時候，還得買一大批東西，送給村上的人。富生這傢伙是勢利狗眼睛，平時老是瞧不起人，就是他不送。敎他眼熱眼熱！……不過不過送給他也好。敎他看看我阿發不是像他一樣的勢利鬼！阿福得送雙倍。他平時肯帮我忙。或是自己在鄕下買幾十畝田給他種也好。佃租比人家少個對折。這樣又是人情，自己又是創了產業。……」鄕下是再也没有什麽可想的了。田地創了，人情做了，妻兒也帶到廣州來了。</p>
<p>「到了城裏，第一當然要造一座洋房。再送兒子女兒上學。自己呢，或是邀幾個朋友來家裏打打麻雀。或是去一定好大茶樓飲茶，聽金碧艷唱仕林祭塔。阿狗的媽呢？由她自己高興，看影戲也好，去大公司也好，橫竪有的是錢，我每月給她五十塊零用錢！······」</p>

<h3>糧食　跌風猛襲期粉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份呈一致暴跌之象、洋麥報價、雖芝加哥回漲四五六角左右、坎拿大漲一二角左右、惟開價後、市面雖尙略定、不過全部分人心、已經虚疲達於極點、以廠商要求政府維持、照幾日之經過、事既不可能、環境又可不許、故客戶多頭、已紛紛出檔、小廠方面、亦有抛出、較前週市價、已跌二分不等、迨至下午開盤、猛烈之跌風、又復侵襲、因傳大廠方面、知前途之暗淡、愈益增重、卽維持之說、亦爲明日黃花、所以亦忍痛、逐步暢抛、近遠各期、均不限價、因此人心大虚、一時賣氣之盛、無以復加、差度之低、已出意料之外、如本月份起至八月份、均已破九角半大關、或則更跌四分之内、此種跌風、原因仍屬實銷不振、供多於求所致耳結果本月份暴跌七分、六七月份跌七分二厘半、七月份跌亦分半、九十月份跌五分二厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥疲落六七分　洋麥報好···天氣轉佳　粉銷不暢···現貨湧到</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後各月份均見一致疲落之象、因洋麥報價、回漲一二角及四五六角不等、故開價後、人心尙定、施以天時良好、業中人心思、已見軟弱、開價已小二三分、迨至下午開盤、因粉市發生暴落、市塲賣氣、自然爲之帶暢、幸内地帮未曾暢出、否則亦難免暴落也、結果本月份較跌七分、七月份跌六分、八月份跌五分、現麥市面仍無做開、市上現貨雖旺、各廠則以洋麥暢到、粉銷又未起色、故仍一致擯住云、</p>

<h3>失地四百八十萬方哩</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>我國土地，自雅片戰役而後，一會兒被甲國割一塊，一會兒給乙國挖一角，直到現在，究竟失去了多少，這一筆糊塗賬，尙没有結出來。好在此刻已有外人代我們算淸楚了，我們不妨把牠開列於後，讓地主们看看這個損益到底如何：</p>
<p>美國外交政策恊會遠東問題專家皮遜氏，今日在其正式報告中宣稱，「如　　中國之領土長被侵略，則將降爲小國，而爲日木所宰制，」云，皮遜報告　　續稱，「日本最近侵佔滿洲與熱河，土地之廣，實與一八四二年英國併呑　　香港以來九十年間，中國所失去之二百四十萬方哩相等，」……（二十九日　　國民電）</p>
<p>這張淸單開得很簡明，雖没有作個總計，但我們一算就算得出我國在近九十年内，共失去土地四百八十萬方哩。因爲以前失去二百四十萬方哩，而日本於兩年内，又侵得和這數目相等的一片，所以合起來，便成四百八十萬方哩了。按以前我國所喪失的領土爲香港安南緬甸台灣朝鮮等。其中英取香港緬甸，法攫安南，而台灣和朝鮮，則亦爲日本所奪。這樣看來，日本所搶刦的土地，約佔我國失地總數三分之二。</p>
<p>我國素以地廣人衆誇稱世界，自從門戶被外人撞開，相繼失城陷地，致疆土日蹙，人口日减，今華北危機未解，華南又忽呈動亂之狀。至若内蒙新疆西藏，地處邊陲，列强伺側，禍患四伏，亦不能高枕無憂。故我國一日不强，則國土一日難以鞏固。長此被人侵略，豈但如皮遜氏所說，將降爲小國，抑且亡國而有餘呢·</p>
<h3>生之獨白</h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>朋友：</p>
<p>獨個兒在夜的曠漠中行進着的旅人，就能把自己的血跡當作火星，該也是高興的吧？</p>
<p>這年頭兒有許多學者在給靑年寫勵志的文章，敎給他們怎樣去忍耐，怎樣去努力，又怎樣地去奮鬥；可是，假使生活的旅程是黑暗的，在没有得到光亮之前，地圖對於一個孤獨的旅人又有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>自己向來不願看勵志哲學一類的書，也從不想敎人家看的；從實生活的體騐上，感覺到勵志一類的話，無論作者或述者是否具有誠意，牠們底本來意義終究是不負責任的；而且，在客觀的條件下面，和其他的一切裝飾品一樣，也是建築在社會的上層的。</p>
<p>如果說，鼓勵能敎人興奮：那末，一切興奮劑的反作用都該是麻醉吧？</p>
<p>生活的經騐，不是任何的字句可以講授的，要得到它，祇有去體騐，而生活的意義，也惟有體騐過的人才能按照看自己週圍的物質環境去解釋的。</p>
<p>在生活的道路上行進，自家也許能記得一點過程，雖然是短短的；然而在不斷的磨練和進行中，也許看到三三兩兩的旅客，站在支路的口子上猶疑，思慮，等待一點什麽的，痛苦的眼淚，也許會沾濕一兩顆沙礫，可是，這却從不曾灌活了任何的小草，也不曾淹没過自己的心啊。</p>
<p>當自己初次遇到岔路口的時候，也曾昇起了都少的遲疑吧？可是看着擦身走過的旅客，頭也不回的遠遠地走去了，感到多驕傲，都憤怒哪。</p>
<p>就在這火花爆發的當兒，在生命的原野中，我學到了選擇的方法。</p>
<p>這世界是永遠矛盾的衝突的；一切的事物呈顯了牠们的美麗與醜陋，每種東西都敎人留戀和厭惡；然而，自然的變化與演進，都循了同一的軌律而運動的，正如没有完全使人厭棄的物質，同樣地，在世界也找不到完全使人留戀的東西。假使說，戀愛是絕對美麗的，那末爲什麽人們當戀愛和社會制度發生衝突的時候，就没有决定的動向呢？反之，死該是可怕的吧？但在某種意義下，牠也許是可愛的。</p>
<p>戀愛與物質，刻苦與享樂，成功與失敗，生存與死亡，在這生活的道路中，永遠是對立着的，而在這對立的火花中，你和我就被燃燒，被鍜鍊了。</p>
<p>不願意自己被白熱的火焰鎔化，更不願讓你給大火毁滅，當一切在衝突的時候，便該是我們選擇的時候了。</p>
<p>在一切的對立中，你要想兩面顧全嗎？那是没有這會事的；譬如爲了戀愛的奮鬥，你又想顧全和社會制度的妥恊，你自己似乎覺得很聰明吧？你說你已懂得了取巧的方法；可是，你近來不是正煩悶着嗎？</p>
<p>借這一點你所體騐到的事實，我要想告訴你：「生活的最高形式，在選擇而不在取巧；兩全的事情是世界上不會有的，在二者相對的岔路中，你就開始决定地選擇一條吧。」</p>
<p>可是，你千萬别忘掉了那選擇的意義。</p>
<p>别多想，也不要猶疑，選那生活意義較大的方向吧。在無邊的黑暗中，謹伸給你我底手。</p>
<h3>虎口的人</h3>
<p>— 文黑</p>
<p>（路上印象之一）</p>
<p>搭電車，常常給開車的驟然地將車停住而令我的心頭卜通卜通地跳動，同時并且在腦裏浮上了一個感覺！一定是有什麽人穿過馬路。今天因爲車上人多，自己站在前面月台上，一個恐怖的又是緊張的銀幕上的畫面，給了我一個深刻難忘的印象。</p>
<p>電車從八仙橋向大自鳴鐘那邊玲玲軋軋地飛奔下去，在西新橋的路口，交通燈標着綠色的光，開車的脚打着下面的鈴急切而響亮，忽然右邊有一個人急步地穿過馬路，他走到電車的軌道上，電車恰恰飛奔到他的身邊，我下意識地感覺到那人的危險，不由自禁地喊着，「啞！」那開車的眼快也立刻將車停住大呌一聲，「猪玀！」這已經够使我的心頭在猛跳了，不料那穿馬路的人，剛剛闖過了電車的前面，左邊的後面飛來了一部黑牌汽車！那汽車立刻就好比一隻上屠塲的猪玀一樣，慘呌一聲也停住了。行人道上有人發出一聲替他担心的而且是自己驚訝的聲音「唉呀！」我看那穿馬路的人，一張胖紅的臉變成靑白色，自知犯規地又自知脫險地低着頭一聲不</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>嚮地加緊了步伐走上行人道上，而他的額上的汗珠已經在淌下了。那人身穿一件咖啡色的春绸長袍，這印象刻上我的腦裹，到了現在一想起，立刻他的影子就浮現在我的眼前。</p>
<p>馬路如虎口，那人恰恰是一個虎口的人！</p>
<h3>結婚篇</h3>
<p>— 祥鼎</p>
<p>蓋聞男大當娶，女大當嫁，此所以结婚是尙；夫婚何以要结，以其要養兒子也；孟子日「不孝有三，無後爲大］」：</p>
<p>，聖人已昭我以明訓，是則養兒子固名。正言順之事也，</p>
<p>且也，有天地而後有萬物，而後有男女，所謂「二五媾精，萬物化生一，结」</p>
<p>婚固本乎此者也；而環顧今日之谈民族主義者，尤多以提倡繁殖人口爲能事，，是則结婚之非等閒事也明甚矣，</p>
<p>夫男女媾婚，人生之樂境也；顧亦麻煩之事也！始則有媒妁之言，繼則須父母之命；而索禮金，爭嫁妝，幾費口舌；占年庚，揀吉日，連番勞碌；女宅旣要排塲，男家更期顯煥，而洋鈿鈔票無瞧類矣！迨乎繁文俗節旣過，乃雙雙送入洞房，兩兩相連衾枕，則今宵之樂，當又不問可知矣·</p>
<p>論夫結婚之典禮也，又有老法與新法之别·夫老法結婚，繁文多而俗節細；公館不論大小，總須掛燈結彩，陳設輝煌；眷戚無分親疏，都必穿紅着綠，爭妍鬥艷；新郎則長袍而馬褂，新娘則鳳冠而霞帔；始則參天謁地，跪拜作揖，苦煞四條腿；繼則吃酒閙房，浪語笑謔，急壞兩顆心，所謂「好事多磨折」者此也！</p>
<p>若夫新法結婚，又名「文明結婚」，非國粹之周禮，乃西洋之夷制也；其舉行也，類多在敎堂；既少奪目之燈彩，又鮮刺耳之吹打，佈置簡單，僅設鮮花數事而已；新郎則西服而革履，新娘則旗袍而披紗；牧師證婚，還須祈禱賜福；嬪相攙扶，樂得從旁端相；迨乎行禮既畢，雖必來一個「報告戀愛經過」之要求，但畢竟無老法閙房之難堪也！</p>
<p>至於此外又有養出兒子而後結婚者，是亦猶商店之「先行交易，擇吉開張」也；雖有反乎禮法，固未損於孝道，未可以厚非之也！</p>
<h3>騐屍</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>男的，女的，老的，少的，一羣一羣，像潮水般向狹隘的衕口捲入。刹那間，將細長的ＸＸ衕，擠得滿坑滿谷，水洩不通子；可是，後來的還在用力向人縫里鑽。</p>
<p>擾雜的聲音也聽不淸在說些什麽？　　「死得眞可怕呀！滿面都是血，舌頭拖出三四寸長呢；還有眼睛也突出來啦！」一個穿藍布工衣的，從衕底裏擠出來，向軋在半衕裏無法光顧的人羣報告。</p>
<p>於是紛紛的議論又開始了；　　　「爲什麽死得這樣怕呢？」</p>
<p>據說是吊死的、吊死鬼是多麽　人呀！你没有看見中上吊戲裏的吊死鬼麽？」</p>
<p>衕裏的人羣都向兩邊退讓，中間賸出一條小路。</p>
<p>二個穿制服的警察，持着粗粗籐條，威風十足地直冲進來。後面隨着一頂小轎，再後跟着四個當差模樣的人，一直向衕底的一間低矮破陋的平房裏進去。</p>
<p>「啊！這是縣里的王老爺呀，他特地趕來騐屍的。」一個留着短髭的人，在得意洋洋地告訴給他們聽。</p>
<p>「爲什麽報官呢？唉！眞可憐，被官騐過屍的鬼，就永遠不能投胎了。」一個五十餘歲的老婆婆對她的同伴說着。</p>
<p>「是囉，棺材上還要貼封條呢。」</p>
<p>糟雜的聲音，驟然靜寂了：衕中的人羣，又向兩邊退讓；二個警察押着一個西裝少年和一個老婦，向衕口出去，接着小轎，當差，都去了。</p>
<p>「老黃，你認識麽？這個警察押着的少年，就是阿順呀！他在上海　了　年，居然做到洋行裏買辦，發大財啦」！</p>
<p>「是他嗎？就是這個張媽的兒子了。爲什麽縣老爺把他們都捉去了呢？」　　「據說，阿順妻外面名聲不好聽，所以昨天他特地從上海趕來。夜裏將妻子狠狠打了一頓，而且還逼她簽離婚書，那裏曉得她會半夜裏尋死呢！」</p>
<p>「哈！打妻子也有罪的麽？又不是他打死的，也値得將他們捉到縣里去一。老黃正在高聲地說；旁邊一個大胖子就插嘴道；</p>
<p>「你們那里曉得，阿順做了幾年買辦，在上海坐汽車，住洋房，並且還討了二個小老婆呢。現在因爲吊上了一個美貎的女學生，下月裏就預備要結婚了；所以他想法子先要將家裏的黃臉婆離婚，免得將來糾纒呢。你們想我們衕裏的人，那一個不曉得阿順嫂的賢慧呢」？</p>
<p>各個人口中還在紛紛地議論着。像潮水一般的人羣緩緩地朝衕口捲了出去，冷落的ＸＸ衕比從前更形冷落了。</p>
<p>「男女平等，眞是騙人的空口號！否則封建時代的病態，那裏還會存在到二十世紀的今日呢？」我自己一路這樣地想。</p>

<h3>一般没有資格入學校的問題</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>讀鄭曉滄君譯的小婦人，引起了一個問題，寫出來請先生指敎，這書描寫家庭骨肉之情深，友誼之眞摯，讀了眞令人對於家人能益增好感。尤其是馬夫人之深愛其諸女，更使我憶起我的已亡故的母親，而引起了無限的悲哀。</p>
<p>問題是這樣，書中的「小婦人梅格與蜀，在那裏聽她母親的訓話：「正是精神快樂、着實强於做人家不快樂的夫人、或者不守　道的女子東奔西跑地　未來的丈夫。」馬夫人肯定地說：「不要煩心，梅格，貧窮很少能却退眞摯的愛人的。」······</p>
<p>是的，没有合意的愛人是寗可獨身的，而且有她們這樣的賢父母，卽使不出嫁也可以過着很快樂的一生。而書中的梅格，終和柏魯客訂婚，蜀與勞笠也很有成爲眷屬的可能。（我還未讀續集好妻子）但在我們中國，貧窮的確能却退愛人的。一般没有資格入學校的女子，將怎樣去解决她們的婚姻問題呢？聽憑父母之命，謀妁之言吧，那恐怕不會有好的結果；終身不嫁吧，却又缺乏自立的能力與良好的環境；自己去找尋合意的愛人吧，不但没有機會，就使找得到，頑固的家庭與吃人禮敎的社會也是不能通過的。高明的先生，請你告訴她們，應當怎樣去解决這困難的問題！</p>
<p>讀者蘭芳上</p>
<p>答；蘭芳女士提出了兩個問題，一是貧窮能否却退愛人，一是「一般没有資格入學校的女子，將怎樣去解决她們的婚姻問題。一這兩個問題似乎很平常，却極普遍，實際上也着實使「一般没有資格入學校的女子」感覺到苦悶。所以編者特地提出討論，並希望大家對此種問題多多發表意見，使這些問題能够得到一個比較滿意的答覆。</p>
<p>第一，我們行說「貧窮能否退却眞摯的愛人」這一問題。關于這你的見解是很對的，的確，「小婦人」一書中的梅格與蜀，她們卽使不出嫁也可以過着很快樂的一生，換句話說，她們並不是眞正窮得可憐，因此，所謂貧窮不能却退愛人者，祇是著者的希望，從一般說來，貧窮對於戀愛是大有影響的·在我們這個社會中，一班頑固的家庭，對于妝奩，賠嫁，等問題的爭執很熱閙，這一點正足表示財產與婚姻的關係。而且，近來因爲生活的困難，許多依恃薪水爲活的人，不但他們的父母注意財產，就是他們自己也深深感覺到維持家庭的不易，妻兒的累贅，因而現在一般人都希望女子能够自立，不完全要丈夫肩荷經濟負担。至于那些力有餘裕養活妻子的人們，則又常視女子爲玩物，所以，我們不管從那方面來說，女子總應當謀經濟上的獨立，爲着經濟關係而使眞摯的愛情產生裂痕，還是小焉者，如果因爲非靠丈夫養活不可結果被丈夫欺侮，凌虐，甚至遺棄不顧時，那問題可就麻煩而且也難以完滿解决了。</p>
<p>第二，一般没有資格入學校的女子，如何解决婚姻，這確是她們的一個大難題，因爲這種緣故，正不知辜負了多少女子的靑春，終于使她們祇好拘着獨身主義丨終身不嫁。但是獨身主義究竟對不對呢，當然贊成者自有其理由在，不過，求偶是人類常態發展。這種事實既無可否認，則我們對于獨身主義自然也無贊成之理由，就是對于那班因社會環境的逼迫而不能嫁的女子，我們也不敢勸其抱獨身主義，却要希望她們放低標凖解决婚姻問題。所以你提出的第二問題可撇開不談，現在單討論在舊式家庭中的女子如何去解决婚姻，並使婚姻能够比較的美滿，不發生問題。</p>
<p>在舊家庭中的女子，找愛人的確是很煩難的，這一點你已知道得很淸楚。但是由父母所定的婚姻，「恐怕不會有好的結果」，這恐怕還祗是你的猜想，受了新思潮的波動，自己似乎還没有經騐到。但編者對于這種問題，見聞却多了，差不多我在本信箱内覆出的信，十之九是這類的問題，所以我認爲你這種猜想，倒也並非過慮，事實上是應有這種顧忌的·但是自由選擇愛人旣如是之難，而由家庭代謀，又是冒險性質，豈非無路可走。那也不然。我認爲由家庭介紹，而决定則由自己，這種過渡辦法並非毫無道理，因爲這在舊家庭内既屬可行，同時也不定完全是盲目的婚姻。近來一般半新舊的家庭大概都採取了這種方式，流弊也似乎没有什麽。因爲，我們固然不會見一個就愛一個這樣濫愛，但也不是終身祇覺着一個人可愛，其餘的人都不覺得可愛的。愛情是慢慢的由雙方接近而創造出來，這大約是對的。所以如果你父母爲你介紹婚姻時，你就要他們將對手方介紹給你，或由通信，或由面晤，先建立友誼，然後再談婚姻，這樣，與自找愛人有什麽差别呢，所異的不過是介紹人兩樣罷了·而且，家庭爲你介紹男朋友，必先經過一番愼重的考慮，在某一方面，何又可較之自由戀愛少一番考慮，顧忌，你交與這種人上當大約是不至于的。但是，你要行這種方式去解决婚姻有二個先决問題，第一要臉皮厚，明白提出你的要求，第二，意志要堅决，不能盲從家庭的主張。我想，如果你行之適當，流弊恐怕是没有什麽的罷，你的意思如何，如果你認爲這種辦法尙有缺憾，或者在實行上頗有困難，請你再來信質疑，編者是極願再提出討論的。編者</p>

<h3>窮紳士</h3>
<p>— 英國喬治吉星作孫浦譯</p>
<p>是在客室裏，晚餐後。身材高大而親切的女主人卡爾曼夫人，倒在她的小朋友羅寧夫人旁的椅子裏，嘆息着問　；</p>
<p>「你喜歡丁巴利先生麽？」</p>
<p>「很好的人。只是有點時别。」</p>
<p>「啊，他是特别的，非常與人不同。我本想在我們吃飯前告訴你　於他的」</p>
<p>事的，可是來不及了。楚是我們的一個很老的朋友。我的親　的丈夫和他曾是在同一個學校裏——哈羅大學生。他是最親切的最可愛的人！我想，他是好得不適於住在世間了；他對於什麽事都很認眞。我將永不會忘記我可憐的丈夫死時他的憂傷——阿妲，我正對着羅寧夫人講丁巴利先生的事呢。」</p>
<p>她對着她的已婚的女兒說，那是一位靜默的靑年婦人，十分相似卡爾曼失人的善良的面孔而更帶些理知，一種高貴的典型的冥思的沉靜。</p>
<p>「我看見他的臉色那樣地不好覺得很難過，」威爾夫人回答着。</p>
<p>「你曉得，他的臉上總是没有血色的，而且他的生活……但是我必須同你講，她轉過來對着羅寧夫人說。「他是一個獨身者，境况良好，可是——你肯相信麽？——他獨自一個人住在倫敦的極貧苦的地帶。那是什麽地方，阿妲？」</p>
<p>「伊慈靈頓的一條貧窮的街。」</p>
<p>「是的。他是住在那里，恐怕是在怕人的寄宿舍裏吧——那必定是非常地不衛生的——只是想熟知窮人們的生活，而帮助他們。這不是英雄的事情麽？他彷彿是把他的全生命都犧牲在那上了。在任何處也不會看到他；我想只有在我們的家裏是可以看見他的。一種高貴的生活！他總不談起這件事。我相信在晚餐時他的會話中你總不會想到這樣的事吧？」</p>
<p>「一點都想不到，」羅寗夫人驚訝地回答着。「他不大好講話，我猜想他的主要的興趣是在格了樓工和外交論上。」</p>
<p>爾夫人笑了，「　　　　的　我　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　給戰作出種種美麗的東西；在我相當地大起來的時候，他便敎我國際勢力權衡主義。媽媽，也許他會　社論的　可是我們總不會　到的。</p>

<h3>敎育電影在中國（四）</h3>
<p>— 盧蒔白</p>
<p>政府對於推行敎育電影，未謂不予以精神上之相當援助。去年十二月十八日爲全國敎育電影推廣處通令所屬各省市敎育廳局一致切實恊助推行。一月二十九日又令全國各地敎育行政機關對於電影敎育務極力推廣。而各地敎育機關雖推行有心而從事無力。我們要謀解决上述的困難，就管見所及，擬定如次；　　（一）關於省者由敎育廳自備映演機及發電機多架。專在没有電流的農村廻映。此項辦法浙江省已在計劃實現中。經費由省府負責。</p>
<p>（二）關於縣者（甲）各縣均有公益費及凖備金等，就中撥出一部份，作爲開辦費。開辦第向民衆酌收銅元數枚以爲經常開支。（乙）在當地學校工廠民衆敎育館無間斷的開映。</p>
<p>（三）組織敎育電影恊會凡經費實無辦法者，縣敎育局宜恊助當地熱心敎育份子，組織敎育電影恊會，向當地人士募集開辦費。</p>
<p>（五）攝製影片爲當務之急</p>
<p>正如蔡孑民先生在中國敎育電影恊會成立會上所說「今後必須自行編製，蓋舶來影片有時感到敎育意味太薄弱，没有多大的效力，有時又感到太專門，一般文盲，或稍具智識者，有難於了解之弊，有時尤感到國情不同，有風馬牛不相關之嘆」。開映外國影片祗是最初的辦法。自行攝製，當然是根本的工作，亦是社會敎育上最有效力的工作。雖今日推行尙未普及，然攝製還須凖備。否則開映地方增加，國產影片將不够供應。</p>
<p>中國每年用於社會敎育之經費，奚止數百萬。庚欵委員會所撥助學術機關之經費，何止數十萬。假使政府能就社敎經費或庚欵利息中，每年撥十萬元以攝製敎育影片，至少每年當有二百卷以上的出品。且出品數量，當年有增加。五年之後，收效當十倍於民衆學校或展覽會云。</p>
<p>（六）應有的共同標的</p>
<p>電影敎化力之深刻化，以及攝製敎育電影之重要性，既如上述，惟其敎化力之深刻化，可以成爲危害整個民旅國家的砒霜，亦可以成爲復興民旅之武器。散漫的投機的電影尙且多害，我們利用爲敎育爲文化宣傳的敎育影片，更不可不認定其一貫的共同的建設的主義。取材儘可各自採取，歸根却不可不有一共同的標的。意大利與德意志的法西斯蒂主義，蘇俄的馬克思主義，日本的軍國民主義，是他们的影片的共同標的。中國雖然一時間不能使整個影業如意俄一般的站在同一的立塲上發揮我國固有的建設國家基業之主義，但至少我們敎育影片應有一致的出發點。</p>
<p>（七）結束</p>
<p>敎育電影事業在中國是極端需要的，可是在經濟的束縛之下，一點没有蘇息的機會。然民族正期待着敎育電影去復興，惟願賢良的政府社會，予我們以援助。（完）</p>

<h3>評「記者雙影」HeadlineShooter丨大上海</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>千篇一律的Happyenping，羅曼斯</p>
<p>，未免太平凡而難以號召觀衆了。於是，需要注射一些新奇的東西進去。這「記者雙影」就是這樣編構而成的。以新聞片攝影師和女訪員爲主角的「記者雙影」，當然可以很巧妙的利用片段的刺激性的材料來增加劇的力量。</p>
<p>地震，火災，這一類自然界的鉅大的變異，因其本身含蓄着的偉大的破壞力，給予觀衆的刺激力，當然是很强的。</p>
<p>格格的搖機聲，銳長的嘯聲，崩壤摧折時的諸種現象丨在這些迫力的描寫裏展開了主人公的戀愛。</p>
<p>雖然描寫密西雪比河水災的畫面，　有的刺激力殊覺缺乏；一般羅曼斯中都有的那種膩煩的愛的描寫，在這裏，便被震災水災這些刺激性的東西掩蓋住了。</p>
<p>究竟這些東西的編入，對於劇的價値有什麽意義呢？很少很少。它留給觀衆的，只是一種新奇的感覺。然而這種新奇的感覺，會在觀衆中間保留多久呢？平凡的内容，就是有了新奇的形式，到底也挽救不了的，只是糟塌了那種爛熟的藝術而已。</p>
<p>我們既分析了那些刺激性，對於河工舞弊的提及，也無須的了。在「記者雙影」，根本上是只要使一篇平凡的羅曼斯的結構弄得複雜曲折一點。新奇，曲折，便是那些製作者的態度，對着嚴重的社會問題，他們只知道以新奇與曲折來粉飾。</p>
<p>「記者雙影」的一貫的態度，在臨了，便故意作琴妮和畢雷絕交的一頓，而以琴妮的失蹤來再展開劇情。這種曲筆，究竟并未能使「記者雙影」動人一點而因爲前面的地震描寫的刺激性較强之故，就使「記者雙影」製造了偵探片的形式的高潮，反見得没有什麽力量。</p>
<p>實在的，這本來是一部小市民的羅曼斯。盡職，甜蜜的愛之外便没有什麽的了。然而在現在，這些往往只能存在於他們的幻覺之中。散佈這種幻覺的意義，當然很容易明白的。</p>
<p>編進了若干新奇的東西，而給這些新奇掩没了一切的「記者雙影」，留下來的是空虚！</p>
<p>威廉加根和佛蘭茜娣的演技是稱職的。</p>
<h3>「記者雙影」之一幕雷電華製大上海映。</h3>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評「暴雨梨花」</h3>
<p>— 敷禮</p>
<p>在劇的演出上，這「暴雨梨花」確是一部很忠實的反映出社會黑暗面的一個大悲劇。它描寫出二個性情不同的姊妹來，姊姊有着的是對於社會有較深刻的認識。但是妹妹呢？却是一個意志薄弱，貪慕虚榮和物質享受的女子，所以在這樣不同的個性下，妹妹終於爲了「前途而誤了前途」。</p>
<p>導演處理這樣的劇情，自始至終是很緊張的展開着。手法的簡潔，淸楚，</p>
<p>没有些微的浪費，使我們得到相當的滿意。幾個對比，尤爲增加劇的刺激力。富人們沉醉在聲色賭博之間，他們的心目中，對於女子，無非是一個玩具而已，所以意志薄弱的女子，被他們遺棄後的痛苦，在社會裏像小英一般的眞不知有幾許呢？這誠如作者所說：「天既生了人，爲什麽要作起災害來，把人羣消滅了，將好端端的人類的心靈，引誘着，挑撥着，使牠們不安定。盲從，瞎追，直追到墮落的火坑裏去」？</p>
<p>在化裝上，小琴同小英的滿頭燙髮，而灣灣的，細長的眉毛，也太不像個貧家女子。這雖然是微小的細事，但也要以不失去電影的眞實性爲是。</p>
<p>講到演員，談瑛是確實較從前進步了，面部表情的深刻，使觀衆也一洒同情之淚。高占非的劉良才，也很吻合劇中人的個性。陳燕燕的小英，前部裏的活潑，誠如一隻活潑的小鳥，後部裏的憂　，懊喪也很使人同情而慨嘆。</p>

<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>大富之家（HouseofRothschild)十五</h3>
<p>— 文印</p>
<p>費茲洛伊說道：「但是没有法子，我仍舊愛珠麗的。」南丹道：「珠麗是一個露德蔡族人，她没有她父親的同意，是不能和人結婚的。」南丹說到這裏，漢娜突然地呌他，同時阿姆希爾亦驚慌萬分地喊道：「拿破侖逃走了！」南丹連忙走過去。這裏剩着費兹洛伊一個人，嚇得面無人色。他呆呆地站了一回，忽然奔了出去，騎着馬飛奔而去了。阿姆希爾說道：「這次歐洲的地圖，可要變色了·」南丹默然深思着，一回兒他說道：「我知道的。」阿姆希爾道：「倫敦各國的大使，一定要哄到你的公事房去了。」南丹很堅决地宣告道：「我就住在這裏。他們又要來求助於露德蔡了。他們又到了要錢的時候了。好吧丨誰要錢的，誰就到這個溝頭來好了！」</p>
<p>在當時，那確實是個驚天動地的大變亂。自從拿破侖從荒島上逃走之後，全歐洲都是人心惶惶，風聲鶴唳。政府的主腦和軍事的領袖，日夜密議着。銀行家和大使們商量着。加以謠喙　起。有的說路易部下已經兵心渙散，多半將歸附於拿破侖去了。有的說拿破侖已經有五十萬大兵，壓在法蘭西邊境，有的說拿破侖已經向露德蔡家族借到了一筆鉅欵，有十足償還，雙倍付息的種種擔保。威靈登大將亦說，這次事情太棘手了，要調動軍隊去阻擋他，非先籌足幾千萬的軍餉不可，並目軍隊要排列到九十英里之長。還有一位勃魯却將軍亦說：「那恊約國的軍隊，非但要九十英里長，並且還要三十英里深。威靈登又說：「要是有了錢，就可以招募兵士到戰塲上去，將拿破侖從地球上掃去；要是没有錢的話，地球自身的表面，亦要受變更了，······」</p>
<p>這時在弗蘭克福，露德蔡的家裏，他們弟兄五個人亦正在恊議着這個重大事項。他們前此曾爲歐洲創造了和平，但是那和平却增加了他們的深痛鉅創。等到恊約國用不着他們了，他們就矢石交加地攻繋他們—猶太人，壓迫比從前更深了一層。因此他們弟兄之中很有人主張這次須要更變方針，去附和拿破侖的。喀爾露德蔡說道：「要是拒絕了拿破侖的請求，危險極大，金錢上的損失，尤屬無窮。第一，詹姆士在巴黎的事業，勢必一掃而空，再則阿姆希爾的，和掃羅門的，都有極大的危險……」阿姆希爾亦說道：「我們二三十年以來，在恊約國方面，不算不盡力報効，但是我們所得的報酬是什麽？我們雖然有很好的家室，車馬衣服等等，但是照猶太人說起來，還不是和從前一樣—住在猶太人街上，靜待着他們來將鐵鏈鎖我們起來！所以我主張這次我們要將我們的力量，掉到拿破侖一方面去，和他重新更始！」他說完了，看着南丹，靜待他發表意見。他默然深思着，他的母親亦催促他道：「我的兒子，你說怎樣？」南丹然後發表他的議論道：（未完）</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Stipulates Local Budget Standards</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to reorganize the field tax and clear the tax amount, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated local budget prohibition standards and consulted various provinces and cities to follow them. There are five standards in total: (1) Income should be determined by expenditure, not expenditure by income. (2) Local administrative affairs should be managed with the aim of eliminating extravagance and loans, so as to ensure that income and expenditure are appropriate. (3) The budget for this year should be strictly tightened everywhere, and a general budget should be prepared. (4) If there is any extravagance in the general budget of each county, it should be rejected.

<h3>Current Commentary: Anglo-Japanese Trade War and Our Country</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the British authorities, feeling that the Japanese attitude in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations was too stubborn, presented the Japanese ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, with a memorandum in the nature of an ultimatum. According to Reuters, the content was roughly a number of concrete proposals, demanding a satisfactory response from the Japanese side. If Japan did not immediately change its attitude, Britain would implement necessary self-defense measures to exclude Japanese goods. At the same time, it was also reported that the British government will notify the Japanese side on the 16th of this month to cancel the trade agreement between Japan and British West Africa within one year. Judging from this, Britain's policy of cracking down on the rampant dumping of Japanese goods in the British Empire market has clearly turned to a resolute course of action. Although the items to be cracked down on have not yet been announced, except for cotton textiles and rayon, there may be the possibility of involving all Japanese goods. How Japan will seek countermeasures will not be discussed for the time being. However, it can be asserted that whether its countermeasures are conciliatory (i.e., abandoning dumping in the British Empire) or strong (i.e., prohibiting the import of raw materials from various parts of the British Empire), it will be sufficient to affect Japan's policy toward China, causing a great change.</p>
<p>In today's world economic panic, Japan can be said to be one of the countries with the strongest economic power. One reason is that the seven-industry production organization can be thoroughly rationalized. The second is that the living standards of domestic workers can be extremely tightened. The third is that the Japanese exchange rate has fallen, which invisibly strengthens the competitiveness of Japanese goods. With these three major reasons, Japan can still be fearless in the face of the world's tariff policies and repeated anti-Japanese movements, exerting a very superior dumping campaign in various countries' markets. Now, if Britain, in order to protect the authority of the world's cotton industry kingdom, is willing to sacrifice its important territories such as Canada, Australia, and India's exports of raw materials to Japan, and decides on its policy of excluding Japanese goods, then the deepening of the Anglo-Japanese economic war will be inevitable. According to yesterday's Havas transmission, although India, Australia, and other countries are willing to fully sympathize with the London government's tough policy, they are still hesitant about whether to follow in the footsteps of the mother country and adopt the same position. During this period of hesitation, Japan took advantage of the weaknesses of the British side to actively cultivate its power and strengthen its aggression, causing the London government to fall into a dilemma, and had no choice but to express a firm stance towards Japan.</p>
<p>Now, judging from Japan itself, in addition to implementing retaliatory measures against Britain, it will inevitably try its best to develop its power in other markets around the world. Our country's market, which has the weakest resistance, will especially become the final destination for Japanese goods to intensify dumping. First, Japan will pay special attention to the methods of product promotion and capital migration in various important cities in our country. Second, it will pay more attention to and utilize the five countries' inherent raw material markets. Given the close economic relationship between Japan and China today, and the expansion of Japan's direct investment in industry and commerce in China in the future, Japan's financial capital power in the Yangtze River basin and various parts of South China will also have a further leap forward than before, and it is even not impossible to shake the superior hegemony of British and American financial capital in China. Looking at Japan, since the declaration on April 17, on the one hand, it has been actively engaged in the layout of economic undertakings in various ports in North China and Qingdao, and on the other hand, it plans to convene a consular conference across the Taiwan Strait to seek the development of economic and political power in South China. Therefore, the scope of the Anglo-Japanese economic war will spread from the British Empire to the Far East, which is also not unimaginable.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Hull once said, "In the past ten years, much of the good time has been spent in the sound of commercial wars between countries. We still want to seek peace in terms of armaments. It is simply the foolishness of our race." Now that the Anglo-Japanese trade war has been released in the period of hand-to-hand combat, its impact on the Far East political situation is also an expected event. When our people are in a time of national economic decline and the competition among great powers is intensifying, will we allow these people to trample on us at will, or will we rise up to seek survival? Which of the two to choose from should be up to the people to choose.</p>
<h3>US Large Airship Participating in Naval Exercises, Success or Failure of Long-Distance Flight Determines Government Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the success or failure of the US Navy's large airship Macon in its long-distance flight during its participation in the US fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea this time will have a great impact on the government's future airship policy. Since the accident of the US large airship Akron in March 1933, the government's policy has been hesitant. This time, the Macon was dispatched to conduct a long-distance flight over the sea to test whether it can be competent, as a basis for determining the government's policy. Senior naval officials announced today that if the Macon encounters difficulties during this test flight or another accident occurs, the Navy Department may abandon the airship policy, at least for several years, and will no longer build airships. Otherwise, if the test flight is successful, the Navy Department will request to add airships. (National Telegram on the 6th)</p>

<h3>British People Resolve to Advocate that the League of Nations Cooperate with Us; Related to China's Welfare and World Peace, It Must Not Be Terminated Due to Japan's Opposition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) London Telegram: The Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Union issued the following resolution: This committee, in view of Japan's hostile policy towards the League of Nations' actions in China, hereby requests the British government to take measures at the next meeting of the League of Nations Council to ensure that the League of Nations' cooperation with the Chinese government in China's construction will not be stopped or reduced. This committee believes that continuing this cooperation in the areas of public health, education, economic finance, transportation, and flood relief is not only necessary for China's welfare, but also indispensable for seeking world peace.

<h3>Japanese Consul Yokoyama Spreads Rumors; the League of Nations Expresses Indignation; Japan Suffers Another Major Blow</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol issued a stern denial, calling on Japanese Consul Yokoyama to pay attention. It is believed here that Japan has suffered another major blow. The League of Nations has officially stated that the sections of Avenol's talks transmitted by Yokoyama were fabricated by Yokoyama. The League of Nations Secretariat is deeply indignant at Yokoyama's intentional misrepresentation. The person in charge of the League of Nations told the World News Agency reporter that Japan has already lost its right to discuss cooperation and relations between China and other loyal members of the League of Nations because it refused the General Assembly report, withdrew from the League of Nations, and violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty and was punished by the League of Nations. The person in charge continued that when Avenol talked with Yokoyama, he only explained the technical nature of the League of Nations cooperation plan, and this plan will not change.

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Japan Problem, Involving the Construction of New Barracks for Japanese Troops in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, Liberal Party member Johnstone asked Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota about the Japanese Third Principle, namely Japan and any foreign activities in China that endanger the peace and order of East Asia. Why was this section omitted from the government's statement to British Ambassador to Japan Lindley? Foreign Minister Simon replied that Hirota's statement to Lindley did not contain this statement, but it was later seen in the declaration to US Ambassador to Japan Grew, and this declaration was also sent to the British Ambassador. Johnstone continued to ask whether the Japanese side's reservation would reduce the declaration it made to Lindley. The Foreign Minister replied that he meant that Hirota's statement to Lindley was very complete, and he had reported it to the House of Commons with the utmost loyalty. If what was desired was to oppose events that endanger the peace and order of East Asia, he hoped that this would be the common goal of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. A member asked whether Japan's guarantee included the construction of new barracks in Shanghai to house Japanese troops. The Foreign Minister replied no, and also said that he had not inquired about the organization of the 9,000 Japanese soldiers. Trade Minister Runciman replied to a question about the results of his discussions with Japanese Ambassador to London Matsudaira, saying that the British government has decided that there is no reason to delay the actions it can take to protect British trade in the hope of establishing an agreement. Therefore, he has notified Matsudaira on May 3, stating that in this environment, the British government has to take the necessary actions to protect the commercial interests of the British people, and stating that this kind of step is not out of an unfriendly spirit.

<h3>French Public Opinion Comments on the Franco-Japanese Exchange of Notes; Japan's Explanation Is More Concessive Than the Declaration; But It Is Feared That It Will Take the Opportunity to Advance Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Paris Telegram on the 5th: The Paris Times commented on the Franco-Japanese exchange of notes, saying that Japan's recent explanation is more concessive than the declaration, and the French government's insistence on negotiating according to the agreement is essential. At present, Japan has many internal difficulties. Although it has a fixed policy towards Asia, its authorities are wise and will not proceed recklessly in the current unfavorable environment. Also, the Paris Evening News editorial asserted that Japan's rejection of third-party interference refers to the United States and Russia, and said that the French government is determined to negotiate according to the agreement policy, but whether Japan also thinks so cannot be reassuring in view of the past Shen-Hu incident. It is feared that when the time comes, its attitude towards the Nine-Power Treaty will be the same as its attitude towards the League of Nations. Now, the dumping of Japanese goods is all over the world, and it is taking the excuse of restoring order in China to seize a vast amount of China in its grasp. What will be the fate of France? Also, the Paris People's Daily reported that Japan is accustomed to using deceptive words to deceive the world when the time is not ripe. Its explanation of the April 17 declaration is only an explanation and has not been revoked, which proves that it has not changed its original intention, and intends to wait for an opportunity to proceed again.

<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires Visits Shigemitsu to Explain the British Government's Warning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) British Acting Ambassador to Japan Tildou visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 am on the 7th to explain the contents of the memorandum submitted by the British government to the Japanese government on the 3rd. Vice Minister Shigemitsu told the British Acting Ambassador that the Japanese government can understand the British government's sincere feelings. After the Japanese government reviews the British memorandum, if it is deemed appropriate, it will issue a reply, but there are some unclear points in its content, so it is now ordering Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK to conduct an investigation. The Japanese government's policy has always been to strive to adjust Anglo-Japanese relations, so it hopes that the British government will first propose an Anglo-Japanese negotiation proposal. If its content is appropriate and legal, Japan will naturally accept the British proposal and is willing to work hard to achieve its goal. (United Press Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Crown Prince of Hejaz Personally Leads Troops to Seize Victory and Attack the Capital of Yemen; Islamic Countries Telegraph Congratulations to the King of Hejaz on His Victory; A Large Batch of European Military Supplies Supporting Yemen Is Seized</h3>
<p>(Cairo) After the main port of Yemen, Hodeidah, was occupied by the troops of King Ibn Saud of Hejaz a few days ago, the local area is still peaceful. Hejaz officials have taken over the local administration. Foreigners who had fled to Kamaran Island have now returned. It is reported that Crown Prince Faisal of Hejaz, who commanded the attacking troops, has now guaranteed the safety of foreign nationals, and declared that he will lead troops to the capital of Yemen, Sana'a. It is learned that the main force of Yemen is now gathered in Sana'a. If Faisal captures Sana'a, he will become the King of Yemen himself. According to news from Mecca, various Islamic countries are now telegraphing congratulations to Ibn Saud on his victory. It is reported that after Faisal's troops entered Hodeidah, they searched everywhere for military supplies. It is reported that a large number of weapons and equipment transported from Europe to support Imam Yahya of Yemen were seized. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Cairo) It is said that a large batch of military supplies was intercepted by the Hejaz army when they were being transported to support the Yemeni army. Crown Prince Faisal of Hejaz has ordered that he will not stop the war until he has directly attacked the capital of Yemen, Sana'a. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Cairo) Crown Prince Faisal of Ibn Saud captured a whole team of camel caravans today on the way to Sana'a and seized a large amount of military supplies. Among the captured enemies were two European officers who trained the Yemeni artillery last year. According to news from Jeddah, Britain will proceed cautiously in the Hejaz-Yemen war and will not favor any side. Hejaz believes that Italy may not intervene to protect the interests of Italians in Yemen. (Reuters Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Minister to Hejaz today represented the British Foreign Office in inquiring to the Hejaz government where the Hejaz army will stop its victorious attack on Yemen. London has not yet received a reply from the Hejaz government. British newspapers reported that Britain is completely neutral in the Arab war and will not intervene until the troops of the warring countries invade the Aden region, which is under British protection. (National Newspaper on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Jour wrote an article on the war between the two kingdoms of Hejaz and Yemen in the Arabian Peninsula and its relationship with Italy, saying that in the war in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni army suffered a defeat. When the news spread to Italy, public opinion was shocked. Mussolini's colonial policy is not difficult to understand because of this. Italy's policy is to seek spiritual and economic cooperation between the new Rome and the old Rome's patrons in Asia and Africa. Mussolini's colonial policy is actually a continuation of this policy. It is still remembered that when Asian students traveling in Europe held a conference under the Pantheon in Rome last winter, many young Arab students, speaking fluent French, accepted Mussolini's grand plan, and their enthusiasm was beyond comparison. Italy, which advocates pan-nationalism, wants to maintain its scattered colonies in Africa as a whole and is unwilling to give up. Since it is the owner of Eritrea (an Italian colony on the west coast of the Red Sea), it maintains the independence of King Negus of Abyssinia on the one hand, and is deeply jealous of other countries' involvement on the other. For example, when King Negus wanted to marry a noble Japanese woman as his concubine, Italy tried its best to prevent it from happening. As for the Asian side on the other side of the Red Sea, Italy often communicates with some Arab tribes, and its connection with the Yemeni chieftain is even more obvious. Now, the King of Hejaz, Ibn Saud, suddenly attacked Yemen. Is it because the Anglo-Saxons are wary of Italy's attempt that this break in the relationship has occurred? (Havas Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3>80,000 People in the Saar Express Their Willingness to Return to Germany; A Beautiful Girl Presents Saar Soil to Germany</h3>
<p>80,000 people from the Saar crossed the border into Germany this afternoon, expressing that when the Saar region holds a referendum next year, they intend to vote to return to Germany.

Goebbels also said that he had notified the League of Nations that 93% of the voters in the Saar region supported Germany. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Naval Power</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Treaty of Versailles once promised Germany equal arms, for which Germany has struggled for a long time. Now it insists on demanding naval equality. However, Germany is a continental military country. If it can achieve its wish, it will do its best to rectify its army and air force, and will not compete with Britain, the United States, Japan, Italy, France, and other countries in the navy. Even Germans who are enthusiastic about restoring naval armaments do not intend to participate in the naval competition plan. Germany's foreign policy is based on the principles of "equal rights" and the abolition of "discriminatory" treatment. However, Germans have stated that if the great powers still retain submarines, aircraft carriers, and other warships, Germany feels that it is necessary to engage in construction when necessary. At present, Germany's naval power is extremely small and mostly outdated and unusable. Germany's navy is restricted by the Treaty of Versailles, but its current naval power is still smaller than that restricted by the treaty. For example, Germany can have eight battleships, but in fact there are only four, three of which are old battleships from the imperial era thirty years ago, each ship with only 13,300 tons. In addition, there is an ironclad ship and the famous 10,000-ton pocket battleship "Deutschland", with a speed of 26 knots and 18 guns. There are also two similar armored ships under construction. Compared with the navies of the great powers, this kind of battleship is actually a cruiser. Germany has four 6,000-ton light cruisers, all of which are new ships. In addition, there are three old cruisers, which are kept as reserves. The 5,000-ton Emden cruiser is currently being refurbished, and the treaty allows for eight cruisers. Germany currently has twelve 800-ton torpedo boats, and four old torpedo boats, which are kept as reserves. The treaty allows for 24 torpedo boats. Submarines and aircraft carriers are prohibited. In addition, the German navy only has six 600-ton fast ships, ten minesweepers, two training ships, and two 600-ton coastal defense ships, which are specially used to protect fishing boats. The entire navy has only 15,000 officers and soldiers. In this year's budget, naval expenditures account for 177,900,000 marks, compared to 167,400,000 marks last year. The actual expenditure is only 132,800,000 marks. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Silver Bill Expected to Pass Congress; Silver Faction Meets with Roosevelt Again</h3>
<p>Washington According to the opinion of the proposer of the Thomas Bill, President Roosevelt has agreed to pass the Thomas Bill in Congress, which authorizes the government to accept silver as the price for foreign countries to purchase American goods. Thomas declared today, "I have persuaded the President that both houses will pass the amendment to the Glass Bill that I proposed, and various harmful inflationary plans will be invisibly cancelled because of this." The Thomas Amendment stipulates that the government's import and export bank may increase the world silver price by between 20% and 25% to receive silver and as the price for foreign countries to purchase American agricultural products, and the silver received will be stored in the Treasury as a reserve for issuing silver certificates and silver coins. Thomas continued that if the results of the meeting between the President and senators on Sunday are satisfactory, he will temporarily withdraw his amendment so that the Senate can begin discussing the Frank-Lea Exchange Management Act and the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act at the beginning of this week. (National Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The congressional silver faction was elated today after meeting with the President on Saturday and Sunday, believing that this session of Congress will pass several compromise bills that are beneficial to silver. A spokesman for the silver faction told the Associated Press reporter today that if they can negotiate a satisfactory agreement with the government, they will withdraw the various silver bills in the Senate and make the compromise plan into a bill. Silver leader Wheeler and other people who participated in the special train meeting also said today that they would give up buying silver at world market prices.</p>

They can also demand iron coins, tin coins, or simple paper money. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>War Debt Issues Once Again Arouse General Speculation</h3>
<p>(Washington) Attorney General Cummings yesterday made a determination that because Britain had paid a portion of its war debt as a sign of good faith, it was different from those who failed to fulfill their debt obligations as defined under the Johnson Act. Furthermore, there is a rumor that President Roosevelt will submit a message to Congress regarding war debts within half a month. Therefore, the issue of war debts has once again aroused general speculation. Diplomatic circles believe that the Attorney General's determination is extremely beneficial to Britain. There is now room for renegotiation in an attempt to resolve the issue. Rumors suggest that Britain is currently engaging in diplomatic consultations, intending to make another payment as a sign of good faith by the war debt due date of June 15th, along with an understanding that subsequent negotiations will be held to reach a final resolution. However, this claim has not yet been confirmed by relevant parties. It is widely expected that President Roosevelt's message to Congress will endorse a resolution regarding Finland's war debt, namely, to waive future interest payments and recover the principal over fifty years, while offering a particularly low interest rate on payments already made. Observers in Washington believe that the United States will likely adopt the same approach towards Britain. However, the British Embassy declined to comment on this speculation. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the U.S. Attorney General interpreted that countries making goodwill payments are not to be considered defaulters, President Roosevelt can handle the war debt issue due in June as he deems appropriate. Attorney General Cummings explained that Britain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, and Lithuania, having made goodwill payments, should not be regarded as defaulters. This interpretation does not restrict the government from dealing with future goodwill payments, as the President can accept or reject goodwill payments and can arbitrarily exempt debtor nations from the stigma of default or subject any nation to the restrictions of the Johnson Act. Furthermore, the entire war debt issue may be transferred to the next Congress for consideration. President Roosevelt may submit a message to the current session of Congress, but such a message will only report on the current status of war debts.

<h3>Russo-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>(Warsaw) Today, the Polish ambassador and Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov signed an agreement in Moscow to extend the Russo-Polish non-aggression treaty for one year. According to the official Polish report, the agreement also contains a provision stating that if neither party declares its termination before the treaty expires, the treaty will automatically be extended for another two years. The agreement also stipulates that the note sent by former Soviet Foreign Commissar Chicherin to Lithuania on September 28, 1926, when the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty with Lithuania, shall not be interpreted as giving the Soviet Union any future right to interfere in the issue of territorial administration between Poland and Lithuania. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) An editorial in Pravda commented on the extension of the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, stating, "The relationship between the Soviet Union and the Baltic states and its great Western neighbor, Poland, has been strengthened and consolidated. There is no doubt that this successful initiative of the Soviet Union will enhance peace in Eastern Europe and consolidate the independence of the Baltic states." Pravda continued, "The final annex to the treaty extension document is of utmost importance. In the first section of that document, the signatories declare that they are not bound by any obligations or declarations that conflict with Article 3 of the Treaty of Riga. Article 3 states that the Soviet Union and Poland must reject all claims to territories outside the Soviet-Polish border stipulated in the treaty. Furthermore, the declaration regarding the absence of any agreements between the two parties that contradict the obligations of the signatories to the treaty is extremely timely and valuable at a time when rumors of secret agreements of a contradictory nature are swirling in newspapers around the world." Izvestia stated, "This new development in the history of Soviet-Polish relations is of great importance for enhancing peace in Eastern Europe and promoting general peace. The Soviet government's step to extend the term of the non-aggression pact with the Baltic states has been supported by all believers in peace. They welcome it and regard it as a new link in the Soviet Union's determined struggle for peace. The Soviet Union is striving to use concrete steps to block and thwart any attempts to undermine peace. The Soviet Union is rigorously implementing its much-touted policy of non-interference and peace towards its neighbors. It is also using all opportunities to eliminate any situations that could lead to disputes in relations between the Soviet Union and its neighbors." The newspaper concluded, "Poland, like the Soviet Union, declares that it is not bound by any obligations or declarations that conflict with the resolutions of the Treaty of Riga. Soviet public opinion will pay special attention to this declaration." (TASS, 6th)</p>

<h3>Shao Hongji Calls on Chiang, Reporting on River Management Process</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Shao Hongji came to Jiangxi Province upon the order of Yu Xuezhong to report to Chiang on the process of blocking the Yellow River breach. Shao said that last year's Yellow River disaster was unprecedented in fifty years. The blocking project started in August and was completed in its preliminary stage on March 17. The central government originally allocated 4 million yuan for river management, of which 1.2 million yuan was used for river management and the remainder was used for disaster relief. There were thirty-two breaches in Changyuan, which was heartbreaking. A large stone dam, 60 li long and 6 li wide, was built at this location. A large dike, 20 li wide and one meter higher than the maximum flood level, was built 10 li away from the stone dam. This is a reliable strategy and is relatively safe. Millions more are still needed. Recently, there are reports that the Yellow River has breached again, which may be misinformation. However, this simple approach is definitely not a solution. The best way is to dredge the source. At present, the most important thing is to increase thickness and height to resist the water force, create forests, and build reservoirs and lakes.

<h3>Zhejiang Tea Market Unprecedentedly Depressed</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) This year's tea market in Zhejiang Province has become unprecedentedly depressed.

The current highest price is only more than 60 yuan per load. At the same time, they have increased the weight of the scales. In the past, 16 taels was equal to one catty.

<h3>Mao Bingwen Talks About the Situation in the Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Mao Bingwen returned to Nanjing from Jiangxi. After his business was completed, he will go to Jiangxi on the 8th. According to him, since the Red Bandits were pursued and blockaded by the Central Army, the military's use of the Baoding-Gonglu highway has been of great assistance. The situation in the bandit areas is unspeakably miserable. The mountains are barren and the houses are either destroyed or burned. The youth have been almost completely slaughtered. Only the orphans and widows remain. They are now unable to farm and lack manpower. If they find a stranger who is a strong man, they will not only be willing to marry their young and beautiful daughters to him, but will also give him all of their property to enjoy. Therefore, it has recently been discovered that soldiers of the National Army occasionally leave the military and privately go to the homes of civilians to become husbands. This is the misery of the people who have been slaughtered by the Red Bandits. It can be seen that although the Red Bandits can be suppressed this year, the local vitality will not be restored for decades. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Special Telegraphic News</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson received a special telegram from Washington, stating, "We anticipate that the decline in summer commerce will be extremely slight. This is because purchasing power is assisted by the government, which can maintain retail prices, and the National Recovery Administration also maintains a balance between production and consumption. The government now knows that private businesses must soon restore their financial strength to turn over their operations, so it is now adopting a more prudent policy. We anticipate that the amendment to the Securities Management Act will be broader in scope than the current one. The Exchange Equalisation Account does not need to be used to fix the US dollar price. It is expected that the government will use it in the securities market to exchange public debt on a large scale. Silver faction congressmen may force President Roosevelt to concede, but there will never be mandatory legislation."</p>

<h3>Recent News on Bandit Forces in Southern Xinjiang - Critical Situation, Urgent Request for Reinforcements - Also Requesting Negotiations to Stop the Supply of Bandit Arms</h3>
<p>Kashgar Correspondence: Since the outbreak of banditry in Xinjiang, the overall situation has been ruined. The war situation in the north has some glimpses in the newspapers, but the situation in the southern counties, which fell to the bandits last summer, has been cut off, and the outside world knows little about the real situation. The following is a telegram to the government from representatives of refugees in Kashgar: "To Chairman of the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Military Commission, the Ministry of Military Administration, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the chaos in southern Xinjiang has been going on for almost a year. The bandits in Chǎn Prefecture initially aimed at reforming politics. Although they killed many Han and Hui people within the customs, they still showed some restraint. Later, they brewed ethnic war. All Han and Hui people must be killed. The remaining Han and Hui people are concentrated in Aksu, Shufu, Shule, Shache, and Hejin counties, resisting the bandits. The deaths are numerous, and they are gradually being wiped out. Only the city of Shule has been defended to this day by Ma Shaowu, the administrative director of the Kashgar district, who has led the soldiers and civilians in bloody battles with the bandits. Shufu is adjacent to Shule. In the summer and autumn of last year, our army advanced several times to aid, but due to the thinness of the forces, it was gained and lost several times. At the beginning of January this year, the bandit leader He Jiani Yazi, who launched the chaos in Hami, fled to Shufu, led his men to occupy the area, hired Turkish vagrants to plan for him, and then established the pseudo-state of East Turkestan, organized a government, and issued propaganda, hoping to break away from the Republic of China. He also purchased thousands of rapid-firing rifles and many machine guns for horses and infantry from neighboring countries with more than 70,000 heads of cattle and sheep, besieging Shule extremely fiercely. Fortunately, administrative director Ma deployed properly and fought bloodily for a month without success. On February 6th, Ma Fuyuan and La Shouli, who were under Ma Zhongying, led a team to Kashgar, attacking from inside and outside, and then defeated the He bandits. Shule was relieved, and Shufu was recovered immediately. This lone city, the only remaining one, is currently lucky to be preserved, and these thousands of remaining Han and Hui people are temporarily able to live, which is perhaps the greatest luck in misfortune. However, the bandit forces are still strong and unable to be eliminated. The inside and outside are isolated, and calls for help are ineffective. If the time is delayed any longer, they will inevitably be destroyed by the bandits. The lives of these thousands of people are not worth regretting, but the tens of thousands of miles of territory are the continuation of the four northeastern provinces. How can we not feel the pain? We earnestly request that our government take into account the importance of border defense, report to Ambassador Yan to find a way to stop the supply of bandit weapons, and quickly send reinforcements to thoroughly eliminate the bandits to save the crisis. We are extremely grateful. Knocking from Zhang Xianyao, Yang Qingming, Lu Shaozhou, Tao Mingrong, Li Qikang, Cai Zhongdao, Zhang Shusong, Yan Zheqing, Xie Menglin, Wang Jiantang, Dong Guangxin, and Zhang Taobing, representatives of Kashgar refugees. March 13th."</p>
<h3>Eastern Route Army Recaptures Shanghang Old County</h3>
<p>丨Breaks Through Two Lines of Defense of Red Bandits in Changting丨</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the Southern Route Army recaptured Junmen Ridge and approached Huichang, the Fourth Column of the Eastern Route Army in western Fujian also actively advanced from Longyan to Tinglian. A certain division, taking charge of the Shanghang area on the left flank, attacked Changting. The Red bandits in Changting had defenses along this route, with Baisha as the first line of defense, Shanghang Old County as the second line of defense, and Nanyang as the third line of defense. In mid-April, a certain division successively captured Baisha and Daxiangba, breaking the first line of defense of the Red bandits. On April 26th, they broke the second line of defense and recaptured Old County. The bandits retreated towards the third line of defense, Nanyang. The Eastern Route Headquarters in Zhangzhou received a telegram from the front line on the 30th reporting the battle situation, stating, "The bandits in Old County are the Zhou Tingping department of the pseudo 24th Division and the Shi Pai army, totaling more than 5,000 men and more than 4,000 guns, as well as dozens of automatic rifles. The main force was deployed in the Jiuqu Gorge in front of Old County and buried seven landmines. Our army used the main force to sneak around the left side of the bandits through a side road beside Bian Mountain East Jia Mountain.</p>
<p>A reconnaissance team of the entire division feigned an attack on the front, and another small unit was sent to occupy the machine head to cover the right side. At You Chen, they advanced lightly from Baisha to suppress. Before long, they occupied the Bian Tou Mountain East Jia Mountain side. This place is the highest peak in Shanghang, and the terrain is dangerous. There was a bandit sentry. Fortunately, the fog was so thick that day that they could not see their hands. When our vanguard approached, they threw hand grenades violently. The bandits were caught off guard and the pseudo-battalion commander was killed on the spot, and the rest fled. We took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the bandits retreated completely to the right bank, destroying the pontoon bridge and resisting across the river. We pursued and occupied the left bank of Old County. It was already dusk, the river surface was very wide, and the water was extremely rapid, so it was impossible to wade across. Therefore, the engineering battalion was ordered to build a bridge overnight, which was completed by dawn. Li Brigade was immediately ordered to cross the river forcibly. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers were brave and did not care about sacrifices, and they were able to pass. The bandits were unable to support and retreated to a slightly higher ground, stubbornly resisting. After repeated fierce attacks, they completely occupied Old County in Youchen. The bandits retreated towards Nanyang, and Li Brigade was still ordered to attack. When they arrived at Shuangxitian, the bandits again concocted many plans, hiding in the paddy fields. When the vanguard of the brigade passed, they did not fire a shot. When the main force approached, they all jumped out and came to rob weapons in dozens of columns. Fortunately, the brigade was very calm and used a column formation, firing with fierce blasts on both sides. The bandits suffered casualties all over the field. Knowing that the plan was not successful, the remnants began to flee towards the Lingtou area. At Yewan, Li Brigade camped in Shuangxitian. According to reports, that night the bandits seemed to have retreated towards Tongxian Caixi. At Ganchen, Li Brigade had been ordered to pursue Tongxian, and another unit had been sent to Caixi to suppress them. It is estimated that in this battle, the bandits lost one battalion commander, with a total of more than 700 casualties. Several bandits were captured, more than 30 guns were seized, and many important documents were found. Except for the pursuing troops, the rest were gathered in Old County to build blockade fortifications," etc. (May 4th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Jiangxi on the Verge of Collapse - Internal Differences, Unwilling to Act Alone - All Want to Take the Opportunity to Surrender but Have No Chance</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: According to information from a captured pseudo-battalion commander, (1) Since the Fifth Encirclement and Suppression Campaign, the bandit army has suffered repeated defeats, and many differences have arisen internally. The pseudo-regimental commander and below are unwilling to act alone and want to wait for an opportunity to surrender. In fact, they cannot bear the pain of a life like cattle and horses. However, they are under the surveillance of the pseudo-political commissar and the guiding committee, and there is no chance to escape. Now, except for the people in the bandit area who have divided the land, others cannot wait to grow wings and return. Recently, there have been more and more escapes, and the pseudo-forces have been guarding even more strictly. No matter what the work is, old soldiers account for 60% to 70% of the new soldiers to monitor them, but the escape wind cannot be avoided, because the old soldiers are also shaken and unreliable. (2) The pseudo-ninth army group suffered heavy casualties after the disastrous defeat in Jigong Mountain. More than a thousand new soldiers were drawn from the rear. They had very little training, so they looked like wooden men when they heard the sound of gunfire, neither aiming nor knowing how to load bullets. According to the captured pseudo-company commander, (1) Recently, the people in the bandit area have been abnormally panicked, the bandit army has been shaken, and there is no intention to fight. Internal disputes often occur. (2) In the battles of Yun Sai and Xinqiao, the pseudo-thirteenth division suffered more than 500 casualties. (3) The method of bandit chiefs monitoring bandit soldiers is stricter than before. In addition to the strict monitoring by the committee members, secretaries, and party members of the pseudo-branch, the pseudo-division headquarters also sends secret investigations to investigate in shifts. Unless it is during combat, all bandit officers and soldiers are strictly forbidden to leave the team without authorization to prevent them from taking the opportunity to surrender to the outside. (4) Most of the middle-ranking officers in the bandit army understand the gradual failure of the bandit army, and the lower-level cadres have shown a state of panic, and the general bandit soldiers are psychologically shaken. The pseudo-ninth army group has shot nearly dozens of bandit soldiers in the past month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Celebrities Welcome Wang Yitang - A Eulogy on the Beach Explaining the Meaning of "Virtue Over Strength"</h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: Japanese celebrities such as Count Kiyoura Keigo and Tokonami Takejiro held a welcome meeting for Wang Yitang at the Tokyo Electric Club on April 28th. The following is a verbatim record of Wang's reply to Count Kiyoura's welcome:</p>
<p>"I have come to the East this time solely for religious reasons, as you are all aware. The words "Sino-Japanese friendship" mentioned by Count Kiyoura a moment ago are also what I have always enthusiastically advocated. I sincerely believe in Buddhism and especially admire Confucius's doctrine of loyalty and reciprocity. Confucius said, "Virtue is not solitary; it is sure to have neighbors." Mencius also said, "There is a way to associate with neighbors," and also said, "To subdue men by virtue, not by force." The so-called way to associate with neighbors is to emphasize the word virtue. It must be known that no matter how powerful one is, without virtue, it is ultimately difficult to achieve anything. Confucius said, "A fine horse is not praised for its strength, but for its virtue." Is the thoroughbred horse not the most powerful? And Confucius's words are like this, which shows that everything in the world must recognize the five words "virtue over strength." From another point of view, even if one has strength, one must have virtue. Those who do not have enough strength must cultivate virtue, without waiting for instructions. Therefore, if one's strength is insufficient, there is no need to complain about others. One should strive for justice, so that one gradually restores one's own strength. Do not be afraid of difficulties, do not take shortcuts, do not be moved by emotions, and do not be deluded by illusions. Confucius said, "The gentleman seeks from himself." If one can seek self-cultivation, one's strength will naturally be strengthened. Special attention must be paid to not forgetting oneself. Let me tell a parable: Once upon a time, there was a traveling monk who often kept three things in mind: himself, his baggage, and his umbrella. He often said, "Baggage, umbrella, me." One day, he stayed in an inn and woke up groggy. He got up quickly to set off and searched everywhere for the three things. He only saw two items. So, he carried his baggage in one hand and his umbrella in the other, shouting loudly, "Me, me, where am I?" Although this is a joke, it contains profound truth. Therefore, I also feel that in everything in the world, one must adhere to the five words "seek yourself, do not seek others." As mentioned above, if our two countries truly understand each other, with the two major principles of "virtue over strength" and "seek yourself, do not seek others," what is difficult about friendship? Just like the esoteric sect of Buddhism, the most important thing is the four words "becoming a Buddha in this very body." It can be seen that if one has the will, even becoming a Buddha is not difficult, let alone other things. I think Sino-Japanese relations are not only neighboring countries, but also like brothers. This cannot be denied by people in both countries. The Book of Songs says, "Brothers quarrel at home, but unite to resist external insults." If brothers do not argue, there is no way to provide fishermen with benefits. The nature of brotherhood is relative and should be based on love as a prerequisite and should not use force to argue right and wrong. If we talk about friendship, fairness is of course indispensable. Any country or nation is constantly changing, but natural historical relations cannot be changed. In other words, we cannot change the blood color and complexion of our 500 million people. It is hoped that those with knowledge and power among the people of the two countries will adhere to the policy and will not stop until they achieve their goals. Today, I have just arrived in Tokyo and have received a grand welcome from all walks of life. I express my gratitude. I wrote a poem on the way and will present two of them on the spot," etc. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province's Finances - Revenue Exceeds Expenditure - Government Announces Revenue and Expenditure Figures - But Paper Money Still Cannot Be Maintained</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has recently reorganized various tax revenues and added various special taxes. The income of the provincial treasury and the national treasury has greatly increased compared to before. In theory, maintaining paper money is very promising. However, while the government is maintaining paper money, it is borrowing advance wages and cash from various commercial firms. In less than a week, the decline of paper money remains the same. (The provincial banknotes once rose back from 90% to 95%, but in a few days, they fell back to 90%, and so far have hovered between 90.15%.) Therefore, the lives of citizens are becoming increasingly difficult, and the market is becoming more and more depressed. The following are the revenue and expenditure of the national treasury and the provincial treasury in March, published by the government, to show a glimpse of Guangdong's finances.</p>
<h3>National Treasury</h3>
<p>(1) Revenue: Salt tax 551,253.40, customs duty 1,912.75, stamp tax 174,711.24, tobacco and alcohol tax 673,827.80, consolidated tax 1,367,875.70, explosive revenue 31,016.70, anti-smoking revenue 1,015,285.62, provincial treasury loans 2,117,475.90, miscellaneous revenue 236,035.87, total 6,169,390.98. (2) Expenditure: National affairs expenses 104,807.00, military affairs expenses 5,412,090.60, internal affairs expenses 13,124.00, diplomatic expenses 630.00, financial expenses 65,871.45, educational expenses 185,321.94, judicial expenses 126.00, subsidies 7,450,000.00, pension expenses 24,577.75, miscellaneous expenses 201,620.01, total 6,015,618.75.</p>
<h3>Provincial Treasury</h3>
<p>(1) Revenue: Land tax and deed tax 450,417.42; Likin fees 54,348.94; Pawnshop tax 20,348.94; Pawnshop tax 20,340.65; Various taxes 819,362.68; Imported agricultural products miscellaneous special tax 1,807,762.33; Kerosene sales business tax 572,778.37; Ship tax 2,744.00; House tax 10,159.53; Business tax 16,756.60; Other income 18,756.46; Local administrative income 260,957.33; Merchants’ advance military pay 436,861.74; Deposit money 33,661.01; Funds raised (i.e., gambling) income 1,276,407.58; Total 5,781,314.64. (2) Expenditures: Party affairs expenses 115,471.55; Administrative expenses 510,753.82; Judicial expenses 320,231.80; Financial expenses 196,999.42; Education and other expenses 303,040.29; Agricultural and mining expenses 88,507.70; Construction expenses 739,259.01; Subsidies 92,744.80; Other expenses 3,250.66; Repayment of principal and interest on various treasury bonds 50,000.00; Repayment of interest-bearing loans 90,500.00; Appropriation from the provincial treasury to the Financial Special Commissioner's Office 2,117,471.90; Total 4,583,230.95. Judging from the aforementioned figures, revenue clearly exceeds expenditure. Why is the financial situation still in a state of panic and paper money unable to be maintained? It's truly inexplicable. (May 1)</p>
<h3>Decline of the Salt Industry in Guangdong Province; The Collapse of the Guangdong Salt Sales to Hunan Company; All Salt Shops in the Province Simultaneously Affected</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The salt industry in Guangdong Province was originally a major export. Since the sluggish sales of Guangdong salt in Guangxi, it has suffered a major blow. The decline of Guangdong salt sales to Guangxi was entirely affected by the depreciation of Guangxi paper money several years ago, and the situation has not yet recovered. Unexpectedly, the route of Guangdong salt sales to Hunan has also been gradually decreasing recently. The various regions of southern Hunan have always needed Guangdong salt, and the sales volume was very large. In recent years, the Hunan government suddenly allowed Huai salt to enter Hunan for dumping. Guangdong salt was seized by it, and there are also many checkpoints along the way to southern Hunan, with Guangdong salt bearing heavy likin taxes. The cost is heavy, and it cannot compete with Huai salt. Therefore, the Tailihe Company, which contracted to sell Guangdong salt to Hunan, suffered heavy business losses. The company's capital was originally set at 3 million yuan and was established in 1932. By last year, it was already in a precarious state. Later, most of the salt merchants from the lower river raised a large sum of money from various sources and cooperated with some of the salt merchants from the upper river to maintain it temporarily. However, last year, it had already lost more than 1 million yuan. Recently, the chairman of the company, Zhao Jingshan, has been working hard in social activities. In the past two years, he has competed for the chairmanship of the municipal chamber of commerce, spending a lot of money, and the company's salt affairs have become increasingly neglected, and the capital has become increasingly short. At the same time, debts have accumulated. Recently, he has accumulated more than 1 million yuan in salt taxes. Last year, he also borrowed 1 million yuan from the Provincial Bank in the name of the Lower River Salt Industry Association. Recently, he has also borrowed about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan from the Municipal Bank. In total, he owes no less than 2.7 million yuan to the outside world. Zhao, with business losses to this point, could not save it and suddenly fled to Hong Kong in mid-April. The company's treasurer, Wang Shaomu, also fled on the 19th with the remaining funds. After this incident occurred, the entire salt industry was shocked. The collapse of the Tailihe Company has affected the entire industry. The two major salt shops, Yonghe Tang and Hengfengtai, operated privately by Zhao Jingshan, also closed down at the same time. The entire salt industry is facing a total collapse. On the creditor side, the Office of the Financial Special Commissioner has stopped its salt allocation and weighing since the 26th, due to the company owing more than 1 million yuan in wages. The Provincial Bank has also sealed the Hengfengtai address and mortgaged it for compensation because the money owed by the company has not been returned. As for the shareholders of Tailihe, they intend to maintain the company since it has reached such a point. They once convened a joint meeting of shareholders to organize the Tailihe Company Reorganization Committee, with three executive directors to handle the aftermath. (April 30)</p>
<h3>The Construction of Liuzhou and Guilin (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai from Nanning</p>
<p>3. Shatang Warehouse: Its purpose is to gradually develop and form an agricultural warehouse network within the area to regulate the quantity and price of food in the entire area. The main business is to be entrusted by farmers in the area to store agricultural products (temporarily free of charge) and can also be responsible for processing, packaging, introduction, or transportation, and sales on behalf of the people, and providing loans to those who entrust them. In total, last year, about 340 shi of righteous rice were entrusted by farmers and stored in the pilot area.</p>
<p>4. Central Farm: Its development plan is to start from Shatang first, and then gradually establish central farms in Shatang, Shapu, Luogou, Liucheng, and Liuzhou, etc. After five or ten years of effort, it will gradually be transformed into land independently operated by farmers, using cooperative societies or collective farms. The Shatang Central Farm has been established for more than a year and a half, and the results of reclamation are not good because the scale is too small. The most important progress in the pilot area for reclamation and water conservancy in the past two years has been the immigration reclamation project. Director Wu mentioned that there is a lot of arable land in the pilot area, but it is all barren, which is rare in the inland. The pilot area has reclaimed 5,000 mu of land in the past two years. This year, due to the surge in 2,000 immigrants (about 500 households) from Beiliu, Rongxian, Cenxi, etc., the reclaimed land can be increased to 15,000 mu. The district spent a total of 70,000 yuan on handling this batch of immigrants. Because these immigrants are almost all poor peasants with nothing to their name, all relocation, housing, farm tools, and plows are financed by the pilot area, and they are guided in construction and placement. For the autumn and spring harvests, the pilot area collects rent at a ratio of 30/70 (that is, the district gets 30% and the farmers get 70%). The measurement and centralization of the harvest are supervised or managed by personnel sent by the office. As for the 30% public rent obtained by the pilot area, in addition to paying off debt interest, paying taxes, and levies on behalf of the farmers, the remaining funds are used to expand various undertakings in the pilot area. Last year, there was a drought, so the farmers' harvest and public rent payment were affected. It is estimated that the public rent collected by the pilot area was more than 600 yuan in cash and 977 shi of rent grain. Calculated by land, the total harvest of farmers is about 4,000 shi. The area now has six fire plows, which were prepared by the Guangxi Machinery Factory several years ago but not used. In addition, the pilot area has designated several places near Shatang for construction of new villages, so that the form of farmers' residences and the density of households are carried out according to a certain design. It is estimated that each new village will allocate a certain amount of farmland as "public land" for farmers in the village to cultivate as an obligation. The income from the public land will be used to run nurseries and schools. Because, judging from the general situation of the farmers' lives in the area, in the case of farmers' families with prosperous reproduction, if calculated on the basis of one husband and one wife, the productivity of one household is only equal to half a person. Because raising children over two often takes up the entire energy of the farmer's wife in caring for and raising them, and also takes up some of her husband's time. Therefore, in order to increase the farmers' production efficiency and strengthen social protection for rural children, the establishment of nurseries is an urgent matter in the area.</p>
<p>Education issues: Furthermore, due to the implementation of immigration and the increase in the number of farm households in the area, it is becoming increasingly serious as the pilot area's undertakings move forward. According to Wu Tingyang, in China's current situation of being poor in resources and only valuing formal education, setting up a school is equivalent to adding two kinds of heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies to the people's burden. More graduates are equivalent to adding more parasites to society. The principles of the pilot area's education undertakings are all formulated in response to the malpractices of the current education system. Therefore, the education funds are taken from public land and never directly ask farmers for money. The schools run are also planned to adopt the spirit of being particularly needed, practical, and action-oriented. For adult farmers, they are also planning to provide "learning while doing" experimental education in agricultural common sense, civic common sense, land reclamation, and methods of improving planting. They are also planning not to adopt a limited graduation period. For teachers and staff serving in the area, they should strive for the stability of their lives and the permanence of their service time. They are also planning to allocate hundreds of acres of farmland as experimental farms for teachers and students, and gradually achieve the goal of self-sufficiency in the school's own production. School buildings and several semi-Western-style Beiping-style teacher dormitories have been built near the office. It is estimated that school will start after the summer vacation. Finally, what we should pay attention to is the main agricultural products of the pilot area. In addition to planting rice and sugarcane in low-lying and watered areas (the amount of planting of peanuts, beans, and wheat is very small), the remaining barren mountains and wastelands have a vast area. The two points that are currently most concerned about in planting are: One is the improvement and promotion of sugarcane planting. The Liujiang River is a famous sugarcane-producing area. Sugar is made using traditional methods, and sales only reach Hunan and Guizhou. Due to inconvenient transportation and unclean color, it cannot compete with machine-made sugar. The pilot area attaches great importance to this point and seeks to make the sugar and sugarcane production in the Liujiang area self-sufficient by improving technology and protecting customs. Three Taiwanese technicians have been hired to first try planting large-stem varieties in the three major farms of Shatang, Shibei, and Wuxiu, with the aim of expanding to tens of thousands of acres within three years and then promoting it to the entire Liujiang area. The second is the large-scale planting of starch cassava. On the one hand, in order to make it easy to harvest vast wastelands within a year, it can be exchanged for cash from outside the province and can make the soil loose and fertile, making it easier for other planters. Cassava is the most suitable. On the other hand, the cassava starch used by cotton mills in Shanghai and other places has always been sold by the Japanese from Southeast Asia. In recent years, the roads have been reduced. Therefore, if the area can work hard on the planting and flour production of cassava, it can gain a market in the Shanghai area. The key to the above two major progresses is the issue of machine processing of sugar and flour. In addition to the active planning of the Guangxi authorities and the area, they also plan to welcome foreign investment with the most favorable conditions.</p>
<p>The above three industrial and agricultural enterprises - the machinery factory, the alcohol factory, and the pilot area for land reclamation and water conservancy - are the most outstanding efforts in material construction in Liuzhou in recent years. Not only does it demonstrate the Guangxi authorities' painstaking efforts, but also its actual experience in innovation and creation can be borrowed by those engaged in construction in the country. After the "hurried visit" to Liuzhou, the reporter set off in the rain for Guilin at dawn on the 15th. Along the way, there were strange peaks and beautiful waters, passing through the counties of Luorong, Liujiang, Xiuren, Lipu, and Yangshuo to reach Guilin, a total of 540 li. Because there were five river crossings in the middle, it was not until 6 pm that I arrived.</p>
<h3>Guilin</h3>
<p>Guilin not only has strange and beautiful mountains and rivers, giving tourists an "overwhelming" impression, but also used to be the capital of the province, gathering talents and being the center of culture in the province. However, since the provincial government moved to Yong, the importance of Guilin has been weakened due to the shift of the political center, and it has been repeatedly affected by wars, and the local vitality has been greatly damaged. In addition, with the nationwide economic depression and the bankruptcy of rural areas in recent years, the economic decline of Guilin and the difficulties in the livelihood of the people have reached the extreme. The low level of social life is unparalleled in the Yangtze River area (6 yuan of Guilin currency is equivalent to 4.2 yuan of silver dollars, which can provide food for one person for a month, and 6 eggs per hao). In recent years, the Guilin Provincial authorities and various sectors have advocated designating Guilin as a cultural area and a tourist area. In terms of Guilin's history and geography, it certainly has such conditions, but the local area has been exhausted for a long time and cannot be discussed without full efforts and a relatively long period of environmental stability. The reporter stayed in Guilin for a week, and most of the time was spent on touring the strange mountains and beautiful waters. The places visited and interviewed that should be introduced to readers are the education situation reflected from the following schools.</p>
<p>Liangfeng Normal College is located in Liangfeng Garden, 40 miles away from Guilin. The garden was built by Tang Zishi in the late Qing Dynasty. His descendants gave it to Cen Xilin, and Cen donated it to the public, hence the name Xilin Garden. The surrounding area is more than ten li, with secluded peaks and clear water meandering. Its overall structure is roughly modeled after the Summer Palace, but it surpasses it in its natural structure. Although the pavilions and buildings are dilapidated due to years of disrepair, the magnificent layout and exquisite architecture can still be seen at a glance, and it cannot be done without holding office for a long time and owning the fat of millions of people. Now it is used as the site of a normal college, and the teachers and students of the school enjoy nature far above the schools of Tsinghua, Wuchang, Zhongda, Jinling, and Lingnan. If it can be managed according to its relics in the future, the beauty of the garden can be unique to Lingnan. Liangfeng Normal College was founded two years ago. The purpose is to entrust the mission to the graduates of the normal school to indirectly train more than 25,000 qualified rural teachers urgently needed in Guangxi. Therefore, the authorities regard the school as the fermentation of Guangxi culture, and its importance is no less than that of the Nanning Military Academy. The first principal was Yang Dongzhen (translator of Morgan's Ancient Society). This spring, Yang resigned and was succeeded by Luo Erfen, a graduate of Peking University. The annual funding is about 120,000 yuan. The tuition, meals, uniforms, and all expenses of the students are provided by the government. Only a deposit of 5 yuan is required when entering the school. There are more than 40 faculty and staff members (mostly from other provinces). There are currently 217 students (8 female students), divided into two departments: normal college and rural normal school. The number of rural normal school students is more than that of the normal college. The normal college graduates in two years. The qualifications for admission require a high school diploma or two years of service in various elementary schools and a certificate. The rural normal school graduates in three years. The qualifications for admission are limited to junior high school graduates. After completing their studies in the normal college, they must be sent to serve in rural normal schools in various places, serving as district supervisors or engaging in other affairs. If the performance is excellent within a certain period of time, a graduation certificate will be given, otherwise they must return to school for retraining. Because of the suitable climate in Guilin, there are no winter or summer vacations on the school calendar, and Sundays are only half a day off. The overall spirit of education is to emphasize group training and the militarization of life. Management is also military-style. In order to fulfill the principle of enabling teachers and students to directly engage in production and action-oriented education in the school, there are farms and vegetable gardens in the school. Students must engage in one hour of cultivation every day. The cooking is also self-sufficient by the students. In addition, most of the roads in the school are built by the students themselves. Due to the attention to students' ideological training and the resulting bias, there is a phenomenon of focusing on social sciences and obliterating natural sciences. According to the statistics of borrowing books in the library every month, the borrowing of social science books and newspapers is always more than 1,000 kinds, while the borrowing of natural sciences is only a dozen or twenty books. This is not only an abnormal phenomenon, but also a reflection of the psychology of young people eager to find a way out for China and themselves politically. It is worth paying attention to by people in the education field.</p>
<p>Military Officers and Dependents Work-Study School: This kind of military officers and dependents school is a characteristic created by Guangxi soldiers to achieve the goals of gathering diligence, thrift, impartiality, and self-reliance in women's lives. The Fourth Group Army Officers and Dependents Work-Study School has been established in Nanning first, while the Guilin Military Officers and Dependents Work-Study School was just opened on April 11 this year. The principal is Zhou Zuhuang, the commander of the 19th Division, and the chief of staff, Zheng Qiguang, is the dean of academic affairs. The commanders and captains of the Guilin District Civil Defense Corps are the directors of training affairs. Other faculty members are either officers of the division headquarters volunteering or publicly selected. There are about 200 students, all of whom are wives of officers of the 19th Division and the Guilin District Civil Defense Corps. As for the sisters and daughters of the officers, they are not included because the current foundation is not large enough. The students' levels are the most uneven. About 60% are illiterate, and among those who are literate, there are discrepancies in the levels of high school graduates, junior high school, and elementary school. They are currently divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D. The weekly class hours are about 26 hours. Among the subjects, sewing and Chinese are the most emphasized, followed by home economics and civics. The biggest differences of the school are two: One is the uniformity of treatment. From the wife of the division commander and deputy division commander to the wives of platoon leaders and warrant officers, all must be admitted to the school for classes, all wear cloth shirts and cloth skirts, and are subject to all the regulations of the school. The second is the indirect punishment system. If a student is one hour late, the school will notify the military supply office of her husband's unit to deduct 2 jiao of salary. Those who repeatedly advise and punish and are still negligent will either be reprimanded by their superiors to their husbands or be expelled from Guilin. Therefore, although it has not been open for a long time, the discipline and the seriousness of teaching are by no means inferior to other schools.</p>
<p>In addition, the reporter also visited the Provincial Fourth High School, the Second Women's High School, and the county library, etc. Due to economic reasons, the equipment of each school is inferior to that of Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, which need not be concealed. However, its advantages are not available in other provinces and are worth borrowing from. One is the simple and hardworking lifestyle. In Guilin (and in Guangxi), male students do not wear suits or long gowns, and female students do not wear high heels. Most of them wear cloth clothes and cloth shoes, and are as clean and tidy as possible. When listening to the commander-in-chief's instructions or participating in mass gatherings, students can assemble in the fastest time and participate uniformly. The second is the implementation of military training for male students and nursing education for female students. After 1933, the sixth semester of male junior high school and the first semester of high school, except for a few main subjects, are completely adopted military management and training, which is no different from formal military life. Female students in the third grade add six hours of nursing education per week, teaching them knowledge of medicine and nursing and cultivating nursing talents in wartime. For this reason, the disciplined life and improved health standards of Guangxi middle school students are not available to middle school students in other provinces. (The End) April 24</p>
<h3>County Magistrate of Dong'a County, Shandong Province Sentenced to Hard Labor; The Civil Defense Corps and Public Security Bureau Merged; An Maolong Abused His Power by Fining Civilians, Forced Labor to Repair City Walls and Roads</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Shandong authorities are gradually promoting political reforms. Detailed plans will be drafted by various departments. Generally, they focus on developing the rural economy with all their strength to consolidate the political foundation, strive for financial frugality to reduce the people's burden, give them the opportunity to recuperate and rejuvenate, and restore local vitality. Regarding the civil defense corps and public security bureaus of various counties, preparations have long been made for separate mergers. The organizations in various counties, in addition to the Lian Zhuang Hui (Joint Village Association) as a self-defense force run by the people themselves, the rest are run by the government and the civilian guns and civilian funds include the civil defense corps of various counties, which are divided into five routes, each with a commander in charge, and the county magistrate also serving as the commander of the civil defense corps, with a deputy commander of the civil defense corps. In addition, there is the establishment of a public security bureau, which is available in all counties and cities. There are three kinds of organizations belonging to the armed forces, plus the local garrison, totaling four kinds. Examining their purposes and names, the tasks of maintaining law and order and defending the locality are actually the same. If the organization of the Lian Zhuang Hui is sound and the people have sufficient self-defense capabilities, bandits can be eliminated. Major ones are naturally responsible for suppressing by the army. The civil defense corps and public security bureaus of various counties are really unnecessary to coexist. If they can be merged, the convenience of unified handling can be obtained, and huge expenditures can be saved. To refresh politics, they are unwilling to increase the people's burden to open up financial resources, so they only take frugality policies to reduce its flow. Therefore, Han Fuqu stipulated methods to merge the civil defense corps and public security bureaus and gradually realize it. First, do it within the scope possible, and wait for the specific plan to be determined before informing the whole province for implementation. The previous Ziyang Public Security Bureau Chief was accused, and Han immediately dismissed him, abolished the Public Security Bureau, and merged it into the Civil Defense Corps. The previous Deputy Commander of the Linzi Civil Defense Corps was accused, and Han also dismissed him, abolished the county's Civil Defense Corps, and merged it into the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday (the 3rd), the Deputy Commander of the Renping County Civil Defense Corps was also accused, and Han ordered him to be escorted to the provincial capital for legal action. Today (the 4th), he also abolished the county's Civil Defense Corps and merged it into the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Recently, Han Fuqu has been punishing and removing military and political personnel swiftly and vigorously. Those who violate the law and are accused, no matter who they are, will not be lenient. An Maolong, the county magistrate of Dong'a County, was originally a county magistrate who passed the exam. He abused his power by fining public funds and put them all into his own pocket. He also colluded with Sun Tingxi, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce. The people came to the provincial capital to accuse him. Han ordered An Maolong to be escorted to the province a few days ago, and Sun Tingxi, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, was summoned to Jinan and handed over to the military court for strict interrogation. After the military court sent personnel to investigate, it was found that during An's tenure in Dong'a, there were 14 cases of fines with evidence, totaling 9,495 yuan, all of which had confessions from the fined people as evidence. Those without evidence were still not included. Han ruled today (the 4th) to double the fine. An Maolong was fined 18,990 yuan, and Sun Tingxi was fined 4,000 yuan. An was also sentenced to hard labor, carrying soil to repair the city wall road at the East Gate, as a warning to corrupt officials. (4th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang County Completes Land Survey by Deadline</h3>
<p>The Provincial Land Bureau sent a team to Songjiang to implement topographical surveys. Previously, they had been proceeding. Now, they have set a deadline for the land survey work steps and the completion of each part of the work: (1) Determining the boundaries and completing the county map (currently one-half completed) must be completed by May, from May 1 to September 30; (2) Measuring the boundaries of districts, townships, and towns, and laying out detailed topographical points; (3) Topography and area measurement; (4) Calculating the area - the first three items must be completed by May; (5) Household land survey and reporting of area must be completed in three months; (6) Checking the reported area must be completed in one month; (7) Holding registration must be completed in one month. Recently, they will first measure the boundaries of districts, townships, and towns. The county government has ordered the district chiefs to relay and comply.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Luodian Town Various Circles Hold Lantern Parade</h3>
<p>In order to promote the implementation of the New Life Movement, various circles in Luodian Town were specially convened by the local party and government organs to hold a representative meeting in the public auditorium. On the spot, they passed the establishment of the Luodian Town New Life Movement Promotion Association. Cao Weifen, the principal of the county-run Jingxiu Women's School, led all the teachers and students to go to the nearby rural areas to investigate and publicize the main points of the New Life Movement. In recent days, the number of listeners has exceeded tens of thousands, and they have a considerable understanding of the meaning of the New Life Movement. The local gentry, Wang Yuming, Gao Xichang, Qian Peishen, Chen Xuexiang, Li Yutian, Yu Yaoqiu, etc., in order to expand the propaganda of the New Life Movement and promote public attention, specially contacted various circles to initiate a three-day lantern parade. It was originally scheduled to be held on May 1, but due to the continuous rainy days, it was difficult to parade. Therefore, it was temporarily decided to reschedule it to start tonight (the 7th). Various stores have been rushing to build lantern sheds for days, which are full of the city, competing for beauty and ingenuity. There are many other participating stages, head lanterns, and lanterns. At that time, the parade audience will definitely be crowded.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: A Careless Accident at the Dachang Oil Factory</h3>
<p>The Dachang Oil Factory, located at 4 Taibao Mound outside the West Gate, was established by Zhou Peiyang with invested capital. Business was fairly good. The factory had over twenty workers, twenty-four old oil presses, and twelve new oil presses. Zhou had two sons, the elder named Shude and the younger named Shuxun. Shude managed the factory affairs. Yesterday morning (the 7th) at 8 o'clock, a fire broke out unexpectedly, causing complete destruction. The flames soared, making it difficult to extinguish. Before long, they burst through the roof. An alarm was immediately sounded, and fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene to pour water and extinguish the blaze with all their might. Finally, the fire was put out, but two newly built houses, twelve new oil presses, and the straw used for making soybean cakes were burned, resulting in a loss of two to three thousand yuan. More than 500 dan of soybeans were soaked and damaged during the firefighting. The cause of the fire is being investigated, and it is quite strange. The factory buildings were previously a *hang,* rented from Jiang Hanqiu. They moved in last May. The room where the fire started was the former kitchen of the *hang*, currently used by the landlord to store several old weaving machines. The doors and windows were sealed and always closed, with no one entering or leaving. Therefore, the truth remains unknown. According to rumors among the neighbors, it is believed that a fox spirit was responsible, causing the careless accident.</p>
<h3>Li Shuyun Comes to Wuxi to Formally Sue Gu</h3>
<p>Liu Zhuomin and his wife, the former head of the Second Public Security Bureau of this county, were detained for refusing to hand over power and obstructing official duties. Furthermore, Gu Renfa's wife, Li Shuyun, and her daughter, formerly of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, were also arrested in Shanghai and brought to Wuxi for interrogation and detention. Later, Li Shuyun and her daughter were released on bail, while Liu Zhuomin and his wife were prosecuted by the prosecutor's office for obstructing official duties. Now, Li Shuyun and her daughter have received summonses from the prosecutor's office, scheduled for a continued hearing on the 12th. This situation has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after the breakdown of reconciliation between Li Shuyun and Gu Renfa, Li Shuyun has hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao and formally prepared a statement of defense, along with an attached accusation. Her accusations are threefold: (1) Li Shuyun accuses Gu Renfa of false accusation; (2) Liu, Shuyun's mother, accuses her son-in-law Gu Renfa of falsely accusing a direct ascendant relative; (3) Li Shuyun accuses Gu Renfa of bigamy. However, the bigamy charge should legally be filed in the defendant's place of residence. Currently, Gu Renfa's whereabouts are unknown, so it is being filed concurrently with the local branch court prosecutor's office in this county. The day before yesterday afternoon, at about 2 p.m., Li Shuyun, accompanied by a female friend, came to Wuxi from Shanghai. She personally brought the above-mentioned statement of defense and accompanying accusation to be submitted to the local court of this county. Because it was Sunday, the submission was made yesterday. Shuyun and her friend are staying at Room 92 of the Railway Hotel, using the alias "Wang." They took the night train to Beijing at about 1 a.m. that same night. As for the court hearing on the 12th in this county, Shuyun is prepared to attend as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Body of the Datong Steamer Manager Found</h3>
<p>After Yan Zhenfu, the manager of the Datong Steamer branch office in Bajiangkou, Dongxiang County, went missing, his family searched everywhere but could not find him. Now, the Jinling Steamer of the Zhenmiao Line discovered a body in the river while sailing past Qiaotou Town on the 5th. Yan's family, upon hearing the news, went to see it and confirmed that it was Zhenfu's body. There were also several wounds near his ears. The matter has been reported to the relevant First Public Security Bureau, which has sent police to guard the body. Meanwhile, a report has been filed with the court in the city requesting an investigation and autopsy to reveal the truth.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Superstitious Villagers Beat and Injure Police Officers</h3>
<p>Next to the Sizhou Pagoda of Dasheng Temple outside the East Gate, there is an ancient Song dynasty bell that has been abandoned for a long time. Suddenly, in the second month of this year, an old woman from Shanghai brought incense and candles to kowtow and worship the bell. When asked why, she replied that there was a great immortal inside the bell who had traveled a long distance to cure her son's illness, and he had actually been healed. This quickly spread far and wide, and lamps and candles were lit, with endless streams of people burning incense and seeking prescriptions. They even brought musical instruments and plaques, calling it the "Iron Bell Great Immortal." The mud, sand, and grass roots on the ground, as well as the old vines on the dilapidated walls, were all scavenged and considered "elixirs" bestowed by the Great Immortal. Although the Public Security Bureau sent police to intervene, it was to no avail, and this has been going on for months. Unexpectedly, the matter came to the attention of the provincial government, which specifically ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly ban it. Failure to comply would be investigated and punished. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau specially dispatched Inspector Chen Zhefu, leading a team of police officers, to burn all the cloth sheds, incense, candles, "elixirs," and banners set up around the bell. Three police officers were assigned to guard the bell, armed, and anyone who came seeking "elixirs" was prohibited. Yesterday, several dozen residents of Dongmen gathered and surrounded the three police officers, beating and injuring them. One of them is barely breathing and may be in danger of losing his life.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Rickshaw Pullers Strike for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Rickshaw pullers in Jiaxing have been striking because the cost of foreign goods has skyrocketed, and business is slow. Their daily income, after paying the rent of four jiao in silver coins, is often not enough to eat their fill. Therefore, on April 23rd, they demanded that the company reduce the rent by one jiao per day to maintain their livelihood. The company refused, leading to a general strike. On the 26th, Party and government authorities summoned representatives from both sides for mediation. County Magistrate Jiang offered to reduce the rickshaw rent by five fen, which the rickshaw pullers' representatives found satisfactory. They signed the agreement on the spot and resumed work. The company representative, Gu Fengtai, refused to sign and issued a declaration the next day, denying the mediation. He also refused to accept the three jiao and five fen in rent paid by the rickshaw pullers. By the 6th, the companies ordered the rickshaw pullers to pay four jiao in rent before being allowed to work. Therefore, on the 7th, all the rickshaw pullers in the city went on strike again.</p>

<h3>Local News: Convening a National Aviation Patriotic Conference – Aviation Association Petitions for Record</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association previously proposed convening a National Aviation Patriotic Movement Conference. After the Board of Directors passed the conference regulations and proposed scope, it submitted a document to the government for record. The original text reads: "Petition regarding the planned convening of a National Aviation Patriotic Movement Conference, drafting the proposal, earnestly requesting review and submission. Since its establishment last year, this association has received guidance from the government and relied on donations from the public to raise funds for the purchase of aircraft, which has been submitted to the government for record. However, aviation patriotism cannot be achieved by one hand or one foot. It requires collective effort and concerted action to achieve the final goal. It is especially necessary for a national mobilization, with unity from top to bottom, and a determined effort. Although our country has a vast territory and a large population, and possesses a patriotic heart, it lacks the power of collective action. Therefore, it is proposed to convene a conference of representatives from government agencies and organizations in various provinces and cities, first to promote awareness so that the people of the country can understand the significance of aviation patriotism, and second to awaken the public to work together with the government to complete the plan for aviation patriotism. This will hopefully achieve the effect of gathering ideas and benefiting widely. Regarding the proposed convening of a National Aviation Patriotic Movement Conference, the draft conference regulations and proposed scope are attached for your association (department/院) review and follow. We earnestly request submission to the National Government for record. This would be a great convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Yuan." It is reported that after the news of the association's planned conference was released, it has already received letters suggesting and requesting the appointment of representatives to participate. The association has responded with letters of support. Proposals from the Aviation Administration and other bodies are also in preparation.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church dispatched Bishop Cai Ning to succeed Bishop Gang Yi as its representative in China. Bishop Cai set sail from the Italian capital on the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso on March 10th to come to China. After arriving in Hong Kong, he visited various dioceses in South China to inspect religious affairs, where he was warmly welcomed by Catholics everywhere. Bishop Cai arrived in Shanghai on the Conte Verde a few days ago. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 PM yesterday, but due to fog along the way, the voyage was slower. It only arrived outside the Wusongkou at 10:00 PM. Due to the heavy fog at sea, the arrival was postponed to 6:00 AM this morning, docking at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Representatives from various organizations, the Chairman of the National Catholic Progressive Association, Lu Bohong, local Catholics, and others will go to the Xinguancode Wharf to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Li Fusun Went to the United States Yesterday - To Investigate the Monetary Systems of European and American Countries</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has established a Currency System Research Committee specifically to study currency system reform matters and has hired Zhang Gongquan and others as committee members. Xu Kan, the Director of the Currency Department, is in charge of preparations. It has been decided to establish the committee after Minister Kong returns to Shanghai and to hire Li Fusun, manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, as a Currency System Advisor to the Ministry of Finance. He will go to European and American countries to investigate currency systems to serve as a reference for our country's currency system reform. Mr. Li Fusun, along with his wife and son, took the Changxing Company's Canadian Empress to America yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. Banker Bei Songsun and others went to the Xinguancode Wharf yesterday to see him off and boarded a small boat to Dongqichang Pier to board the Canadian ship. It is heard that Mr. Li's trip to America, in addition to considering currency system matters, also includes sending his son to study in America and arranging for his daughter to get married in London, England.</p>
<h3>After Discussing Stabilizing Flour Prices, Liang Shangdong Returned to Beijing Yesterday - Gu Xinyi Maintained the Principle of Determining Standard Prices</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Ministry of Industry, due to the disastrous drop in flour prices and extremely sluggish business, specially dispatched Commercial Director Liang Shangdong to Shanghai the day before yesterday to investigate and discuss ways to stabilize prices. Mr. Liang returned to Beijing last night to report and will consider relief measures further. Flour merchant Gu Xinyi advocates determining a standard price principle to maintain the current situation of the factories. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Liang Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>Liang Shangdong, Commercial Director of the Ministry of Industry, was ordered to come to Shanghai the day before yesterday to investigate the situation of the flour industry and discuss ways to stabilize prices with various manufacturers. He originally planned to stay in Shanghai for a week to conduct a thorough investigation with various parties. However, due to the National Tobacco Tax Regulations issue, a meeting is scheduled to be held in Beijing this morning, which he must attend and preside over. Therefore, he returned to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing night express train last night. Although Mr. Liang's time in Shanghai was short, he investigated the various current situations of the flour industry in detail. After the situation is reported to the Ministry of Industry, relief measures will be determined.</p>
<h3>Gu Xinyi Speaks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Flour Industry Association, told a reporter from the Dagong News Agency that determining a standard flour price is a way to stabilize the current market price. The futures flour traded on the exchange last month fell to 1.967 yuan, which is unprecedented. Although it has rebounded slightly to 2.045 yuan this month, market panic remains, and both the upper and lower markets are shaking and unstable. In this precarious period, without concrete relief measures, the impact in the future will inevitably be more severe than today. According to the opinions of various manufacturers, the standard price for stabilizing the market price must be 2.23 yuan, and the buying and selling market should follow this standard as a principle and should not be raised or lowered any further. Only if this can be implemented can the current situation be maintained.</p>
<h3>Singaporean Sin Chew Daily Manager Lin Aimin Immediately Returns to Singapore - First to Fujian and Guangxi, then Back to Singapore - The Process of Being in Shanghai for Business and Negotiations</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Aimin, the manager of the Singaporean Sin Chew Daily, returned to China under the order of the newspaper's chairman, Hu Wenhu, to inspect industry, education, and newspaper construction, and to negotiate matters related to overseas Chinese investment and the sales of domestic goods in Southeast Asia. He has been in Shanghai for over a month, receiving a warm welcome from all walks of life. He also went to Nanjing, Jiangxi, and Wuxi to report and request instructions from Party and government officials, and to visit the scenic West Lake and the construction of the Nanjing-Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway. The mission is now complete. The day before yesterday morning, he returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to leave the country tomorrow morning. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Lin's residence yesterday to inquire about the mission to Nanjing and Jiangxi, and the process of negotiations in Shanghai. Mr. Lin provided a very detailed account, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Situation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin first said that in recent years, due to the pressure of the economic recession, the large and small industries operated by overseas Chinese are on the verge of bankruptcy. As a result, the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily, which has seriously affected social stability. The situation of overseas Chinese is becoming increasingly dangerous, far from what it used to be. Overseas Chinese education also urgently needs to be reorganized. There are very few secondary schools, and after graduating from elementary school, the children of overseas Chinese often cannot continue their studies and must be sent back to China. (1) Because it is not easy to raise funds; (2) Because after the children return to China, no one controls them, and they often do not cherish themselves and gradually degenerate. Therefore, their parents often do not allow them to return to China. The government should immediately provide relief to improve the status of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Missions to Nanjing and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>I (Lin Aimin referring to himself) met with Zhou Qigang, Vice Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Wang Zhiyuan, Secretary-General, and many others in Nanjing, and received warm hospitality. I believe that lack of communication is the main reason for the estrangement and suspicion of overseas Chinese towards their motherland. To seek understanding and support, we must first break down the barriers of estrangement, communicate with each other, understand each other, and care for each other. When I was in Nanchang, Yang Yongtai, the Secretary-General of the Military Affairs Commission, asked about the situation of the overseas Chinese in detail, and I gave a detailed and factual account. I also briefly expressed my opinions on improving the future situation of overseas Chinese. The New Life Movement is being implemented consistently in Nanchang, and it is a powerful stimulant for revitalizing national consciousness.</p>
<h3>Preparing for a National Exhibition</h3>
<p>I had a detailed discussion with the leaders of domestic goods in Shanghai this time. For the sake of promoting domestic goods, a large-scale domestic goods exhibition will be prepared in Singapore. The method is roughly the same as the Chicago Exposition held in the United States. It is also planned to transport all the exhibits from Beijing to Southeast Asia for exhibition, so that overseas Chinese can recognize the rapid progress of domestic goods. Many domestic manufacturers do not understand the needs of the local area, and the goods they ship are often not suitable due to climate and habits. Many manufacturers in Shanghai are very interested in widely promoting sales in Southeast Asia and have entrusted me to introduce stores to expand sales. It is planned to launch and contact general capitalists after returning to Singapore to organize a domestic goods company and set two major goals: (1) to lower prices to resist the dumping of Japanese goods; (2) to make the goods applicable to the needs of the local area.</p>
<h3>Promoting Culture</h3>
<p>The Sin Chew Daily also plans to greatly enrich and reform the newspaper from June, imitating the editorial system of the Tianjin Dagong Daily, and creating a special Sunday essay section. In economics, Shi Liu, Ma Xiangbo, Cai Jiemin, Hu Shih, Lin Yutang, Zhang Naiqi, Chen Binhe, Liu Yulin, etc. have generally agreed to write articles and comments. A systematic newsletter will be added to allow overseas Chinese to understand the situation of the motherland. Editing a Nanyang year</p>
<h3>The First Persian Consul-General Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon - Plans to Rest Briefly in Shanghai - Before Going to Beijing to Meet Our Authorities</h3>
<p>Kai Aosituo Von, the first Persian Consul-General to Beijing and Shanghai, arrived here yesterday at 12:30 PM on the British company ship Tirawa, under the order of the Persian King Pahava. Li Rongyao, a special secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with Mr. Tao Tai, the General Manager of Niangmazhi, the former unofficial Persian representative, went to the Qichang Pier in Pudong on a specially hired boat to welcome him. They then took a ferry at 2:00 PM to the Bronze Man Pier on the Bund, where they disembarked and stayed at the Huamao Hotel on the Bund. Only two daughters came with Mr. Kai. His wife passed away in India several years ago. When Mr. Kai arrived in Shanghai, he was wearing an oily gray suit, about 40 years old, and of sturdy build. He did not speak English, so he could not talk to reporters in detail when he arrived in Shanghai. However, according to Mr. Tao Tai, who went to welcome him, this is the first time that a representative has been sent to China since the Sassoon Ning dynasty of Persia, which has been over four thousand years. He hopes that from now on, the relationship between China and Persia will become more and more friendly. There is no commercial treaty between China and Persia, only a diplomatic friendship treaty was agreed upon in 1920 by representatives of the two countries in Rome. It is heard that Mr. Kai plans to rest briefly in Shanghai and plans to find a consulate address before formally visiting our country's foreign affairs authorities in Beijing. He will establish a consulate in Beijing and will travel between Beijing and Shanghai to serve as Consul-General.</p>
<p>book, Sin Chew Wenku, and other books to serve as a reference for the government to improve the status of overseas Chinese. During my time in Shanghai, I purchased special font casting machines and other items to prepare for major reforms to promote the culture of the motherland and avoid the widening of the gap between overseas Chinese and the motherland.</p>
<h3>Return Trip to Singapore</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin is scheduled to board the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship tonight to send his wife to Xiamen to disembark. After staying for two days, he will go to Hong Kong to meet with Hu Wenhu, the chairman of the newspaper, and go to Guangxi together to inspect industry and collect content and materials for the newspaper's fifth anniversary issue, "New Guangxi," which is currently being edited. It is expected to arrive in Singapore in early next month.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Actively Building a Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone Network - Funds Fully Raised, Materials Ordered from England - Sends Electrical Government Consultant Langai to Survey Various Lines</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Ministry of Communications is building a long-distance telephone network in the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The total funding of over 7 million yuan has been borrowed from the Sino-British Gengzi Indemnity Fund and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Electrical Government Consultant Langai (a Westerner) has been commissioned to survey the lines together with the electrical bureaus of each province. After the completion of the Beijing-Shanghai Highway long-distance line project, the Tianjin-Beijing branch line will be built first. When this construction is completed in the future, it will become a national transportation and telecommunications network. The details are explored below.</p>
<h3>Funds Raised, Materials Ordered</h3>
<p>Since Zhu Jiahua took office at the Ministry of Communications, he has been keen to reorganize the national electrical government equipment and has achieved remarkable results. Minister Zhu is also seeking to connect national transportation and develop state-owned enterprises, which will benefit the government and the people. He has specially planned to build a long-distance telephone network in the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. In addition to the Beijing-Shanghai Highway, which is under construction, the other provinces and cities have been unable to achieve this earlier due to limited funding. However, this matter is related to the national transportation equipment and must not be interrupted for this reason. Therefore, in February of this year, the heads of the electrical bureaus of each province were convened in Beijing to discuss again, and a design committee was organized to design together. The estimated total funding needed was over 7 million yuan, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Sino-British Gengzi Indemnity Fund was then consulted to allocate a loan of 250,000 pounds (equivalent to over 3.5 million yuan in national currency).</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Sino-British Gengzi Indemnity Fund, which was held in Hangzhou on the 25th of last month, approved the allocation. The remaining insufficient funds will be borrowed from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, using the business income from the Yantai-Tianjin-Shanghai lines as collateral. The Ministry of Communications Material Procurement Committee has budgeted for the various main materials needed and has ordered the first batch of materials from England by telegram, which are expected to arrive in China in mid-July of this year.</p>
<h3>Survey Lines, Build Tianjin-Beijing First</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications raised funds for the construction of the long-distance telephone network in the nine provinces, Electrical Government Consultant Langai was commissioned to go to each province with several technicians and conduct a survey with the relevant personnel. The planned lines include four main lines and four branch lines: (A) Main lines (1) From Nanjing via Shanghai to Hangzhou, (2) From Nanjing via Wuhu, Anhui, and Jiujiang to Hankou, (3) From Nanjing via Xuzhou, Bengbu, Jinan, and Tianjin to Beijing, (4) From Xuzhou and Kaifeng to Zhengzhou; (B) Branch lines (1) From Jiujiang to Nanchang, (2) From Hankou via Wuchang to Changsha, (3) From Jinan to Qingdao, (4) From Tianjin to Shanhaiguan. After the construction of the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone project is completed, the Tianjin-Beijing branch line will be built first.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Long-Distance Project Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>The construction of the long-distance telephone line along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway has been underway since last year. The project is being carried out in sections by the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office and the Beijing-Shanghai Electrical Bureaus. The southern upward line starts from Shanghai and passes through Taicang, Kunshan, Changshu, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang. The northern downward line starts from Nanjing and passes through Jurong, Yixing, and Danyang to Zhenjiang. Zhenjiang is the central hub of the entire line. According to information learned by a Dagong News Agency reporter from the transportation authorities yesterday, the project is now largely completed. It is expected that each line can be connected to the Zhenjiang main line around mid-June, and that telephone calls can be made in early July.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Judge Secretly Investigates Antiquities Embezzlement in Shanghai - Strong Evidence of Yi's Embezzlement Found in Beijing</h3>
<p>The case of Yi Peiji, the former director of the Palace Museum, being accused of embezzlement, caused a sensation in society, and Mr. Yi has been missing since the case expanded. Therefore, it has not been resolved to this day. Recently, the National Government Supervisory Yuan and the Jiangning District Court have found strong evidence of Mr. Yi's embezzlement in Beijing. Because the antiquities are currently stored in Shanghai, it is necessary to come to Shanghai to open the boxes and inspect how many of the items Yi stole and replaced. After the whole truth is revealed, a final verdict can be made. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has made various inquiries with relevant parties and obtained detailed information as follows:</p>
<h3>Court Obtains Strong Evidence</h3>
<p>During Mr. Yi's tenure as director of the Beijing Palace Museum, all antiquities were divided into three museums, the same as now: the Library, the Antiquities Museum, and the Archives. At that time, some antiquities were temporarily stored in the Secretariat due to improper numbering and boxing. Yi and the secretary-general, Li Zongtong, were responsible for safekeeping, and Yi's theft and replacement began from there. According to the strong evidence obtained by the court in Beijing, there are 20 boxes where the python robes and pearl treasures on the crowns of past dynasties are messy and incorrect. All have been photographed by the court for record. The news that various evidence was found in this port is probably a mistake.</p>
<h3>Zhou Comes to Shanghai to Conduct a Secret Investigation</h3>
<p>As for the Supervisory Yuan sending Supervisory Committee member Zhou Lisheng to Shanghai to conduct a secret investigation, according to the Shanghai Office of the Palace Museum, the news of Mr. Zhou's arrival in Shanghai has only been seen in the newspapers, and he has not visited the office to inquire. However, according to Mr. Zhou's friends in Shanghai who spoke to the reporter, Mr. Zhou has indeed come to Shanghai. Because the Central Government takes this case very seriously, the stolen jewelry is worth tens of thousands of yuan, and some people are strongly advocating Yi's innocence, Mr. Zhou has come to Shanghai for a secret investigation, and his whereabouts are temporarily unknown to outsiders. Because Mr. Zhou has come this time, he has leads.</p>
<h3>Antiquities Stored in Shanghai Have Not Been Opened for Inspection</h3>
<p>Mo Zong, Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, and Sun Wei, Prosecutor of the Jiangning District Court, led seven people, including clerks and bailiffs, to Shanghai and began inspecting the antiquities stored in Shanghai yesterday (the 7th). Mr. Sun and others did not go to the office to contact and start inspecting yesterday. Moreover, there are 150,000 boxes of antiquities stored in Shanghai. The central government and the Executive Yuan previously pointed out that the Party and government organs of this city should be present to supervise. Therefore, according to the person in charge of the office, if the court sends personnel to come, the office must notify the Party and government organs to handle it together. The office has long been prepared for the inspection procedures.</p>
<h3>Most of the Boxes Opened in Beijing Are Intact</h3>
<p>The inspection and sunning of antiquities at the Half Antiquities Exhibition Hall is still underway. Fortunately, the antiquities in each box opened are still intact. Therefore, very few need to be sunned. It is heard that half of the work has been completed, and the entire work can be completed within this month.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders the Postal Administration: Letters from Compatriots in the Northeast Permitted for Delivery; Counterfeit Postal Stamps Affixed Should First Be Removed</h3>
<p>Since the government issued an order to block postal services to the Northeast, then, considering the people within the puppet territory of the Northeast are still citizens of the Republic of China, if people within the puppet area of China send letters to the interior, they should still be delivered with accommodation. However, the counterfeit stamps affixed are invalid and will be treated as postage due, to be compensated by the recipient. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications yesterday ordered the Directorate General of Posts to instruct various postal bureaus that, when encountering letters sent by citizens of the Republic of China from the puppet territory of the Northeast, the postal bureaus should first tear off the counterfeit stamps affixed to the letter before delivering it, so as to avoid creating a negative impression on the people.</p>
<h3>Whereabouts of Contemporary Figures</h3>
<p>Zou Lin and Yu Feipeng took the night express train from Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Juxia took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei took the one o'clock afternoon express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>

<h3>China Aviation's Shanghai-Beiping Plane Still Stopped in Haizhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>The No. 9 Stinson aircraft on the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping line, which flew from Shanghai to Beiping the day before yesterday (Sunday), stopped in Haizhou airfield due to poor weather and heavy fog. Yesterday (Monday) morning, the sky was still foggy and it was the company's regular holiday (no flights every Monday). Therefore, the No. 9 Stinson aircraft remained in Donghai (i.e., Haizhou) yesterday and will fly to Beiping today.</p>
<h3>Xu Chengqi Flew to Guangdong Yesterday; Overnighted in Wenzhou and Flew to Guangzhou This Morning; Will Then Fly Directly from Guangzhou to North China</h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shih News Agency, Xu Chengqi, formerly of the Naval Aviation School, flew the "Jiang Feng" aircraft, self-made by the Ministry of the Navy, intending to make a grand tour around the country to awaken the people's attention to aviation. Unfortunately, in the Wenzhou area, he was forced to land due to bad weather, causing slight injuries to the aircraft and Xu himself. It was immediately transported to Shanghai for repairs. Now, according to the Shin Shih News Agency reporter, Xu has fully recovered his health after recuperation. Yesterday morning, he flew the repaired "Jiang Feng" aircraft from Longhua Airport to Guangdong, planning to land in Fuzhou overnight, and then continue flying to Guangzhou this morning, and then fly directly to North China to complete his plan to fly around the country.</p>
<h3>Huang Jintao and British Counselor Left Shanghai on the Same Ship This Morning</h3>
<p>Huang Jintao, a representative sent by the Ministry of Industry to Germany to negotiate the prices of steel plant machinery and to inspect industries in Europe and America, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, boarded the Canadian Empress liner last night, and departed from Shanghai at approximately 8 o'clock this morning. Sir Ingram, Chargé d'Affaires of the British Embassy, also took the same ship to Canada and then returned to England. Sir Ingram has served as First Counselor in China for many years and has acted as Chargé d'Affaires from time to time. This time, he has been transferred by the British Foreign Office to serve as an Attaché in the Foreign Office and will return to his country to take up his new post. As for his successor, the British Foreign Office has appointed Mr. Hou Wu to take over, and Mr. Hou will soon come to China to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Tang Shoumin Talks About Inspecting North China</h3>
<p>Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, went to various parts of North China on March 27 to inspect the business of branch offices and to investigate the conditions of the people in Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces. He returned to Shanghai the night before last and told the Central News Agency reporter that this inspection trip to various parts of North China lasted exactly forty days. First, he went to Shandong, where the local authorities have made great efforts to promote industry and commerce. The people are strong and resolute, so various undertakings are thriving. The most famous agricultural product of the province is Kexia peanuts, which have a large annual output. In addition to supplying the province, a large quantity is sold overseas. The price was about eleven yuan per picul before the year, but later, affected by the price drop of all goods, it dropped to nine yuan. A month ago, it was sold for only four and a half yuan, and it is expected to fall further, so some of it has been changed to cotton cultivation. Then he went to Tianjin, which was originally a region where the products of the Yellow River basin converged. Before the September 18th Incident, all the raw materials from the Northeast were manufactured in that port and then transported to various places. Now, they have completely disappeared, and the market is greatly depressed. As for Beiping, although it is a gathering place for the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Pingsui railways, commerce has declined abnormally since the September 18th Incident. Next, he went to Shanxi, where various construction projects have made considerable achievements. The highest salary of officials is only one or two hundred yuan per month. The chairman of the province does not bring attendants when going out, which can be said to be popular. The rural areas of various counties are also quite stable. Then he went to Henan, where the people are simple and hardworking, and some live in cave dwellings. The cotton production is extremely rich. After the National Economic Commission established the Cotton Improvement Institute, the results should be even more impressive. The autumn harvest this year is expected to be abundant. Finally, he went to Shaanxi, where the people are hardworking and diligent, which is unmatched by other provinces. The section from Tongguan to Xi'an of the Longhai Railway can be opened to traffic within this year, and from then on, transportation in the Northwest will be convenient. The officials and people of the province are very willing for all sectors to invest in development.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Establishes a Wireless Radio Station in Yangzhong County</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has spared no effort in building telecommunications and transportation in recent years. In addition to actively planning to establish wireless radio stations in border areas and expanding wired telegraph bureaus, in view of the fact that Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, is located in an important area and urgently needs to establish a wireless radio station to facilitate communication, it has ordered the Shanghai Electrical Materials Storage and Transfer Office to allocate transmitting and receiving machines, etc., and to add Wang Xueyou, a second-class telegraph operator from the Shanghai General Station, to carry the machines to the county for installation. It is heard that Mr. Wang will prepare in the county after receiving the machine materials. It is expected that after the radio station is formally established, telegrams can be accessible to all countries at home and abroad, and communications in various places will be very convenient.</p>
<h3>Situation After the Confluence of the Yellow River Breach</h3>
<p>Since the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Commission has been engaged in blocking the Yellow River breach project, the breach has now been closed, and the dikes have also been closed. According to its project, it can be roughly divided into three items: first, the confluence stone dam at the Shuikoumen of the river; second, the closure of the gap in the main dike at Shitou Village, more than ten miles north of Shuikoumen; and third, the kiln head dam between the two, which is very close to the stone dam. The original plan of the Fenglou stone dam was a permeable dam. After the confluence on March 17, the flow was not cut off, so it was necessary to continue to do air-tightening work. With the approval of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association, the Work Relief Group added a water-retaining dam at the kiln head site behind the stone dam. Its effect is: one is to alleviate the flow of Shitou Village, so as to block the gap and protect the embankment; the other is to prevent the bottom water of the stone dam, and use the force of the water to make the dam more consolidated. When the dam was built but not closed, the water level difference above and below the dam had been increasing day by day. After the dam was closed, the water under the dam was only seen to dry up, and the water above the dam rose and fell with the rise and fall of the river. After a while, the river rose by one foot and eight inches, and the area between the stone dam and the dam rose by two feet and four inches at the same time. Now the river has risen to four feet, and the area between the stone dam and the dam has increased to six feet, level with the river, while the water between the bottom of the dam and Shitou Village is still dry and does not rise. From this, it can be seen that the dam has the function of protecting the new dike and intercepting and closing the air. After the construction of this dam, the counties belonging to the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have been guaranteed safety, and dozens of villages from Fenglou to Shitou Village have benefited even more.</p>
<h3>Huang Boqiao Resumes Work After Leave</h3>
<p>Xu Yuanfang to be Appointed as Director of General Affairs</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Lianglu Bureau, previously requested a three-week leave from the Ministry of Railways due to the fact that his old illness had not healed and his right arm was sore, to recuperate in Moganshan. The leave has now expired. Director Huang returned to Shanghai a few days ago and reported to the bureau yesterday morning to resume his duties. It is also heard that Mo Heng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the bureau, is concurrently serving as Director of the Materials Department, and the post of Director of the General Affairs Department has been temporarily held concurrently by Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng. It is now learned that Director Huang has obtained approval from the Ministry of Railways to transfer Xu Yuanfang, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, to take over. The official order may be issued within days.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Sailing in Inland Ports Should Comply with Maritime Administration Laws and Regulations; Ministry of Communications Changes Three Measures for Issuing Licenses; Informs the Ministry of Finance to Instruct Customs to Comply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the issuance of licenses for foreign ships to sail in inland ports should be strictly regulated to facilitate maritime administration. Therefore, it has separately formulated three measures for issuing licenses for foreign ships to sail in inland ports. Yesterday, it ordered the Maritime Administration Bureau and informed the Ministry of Finance to instruct various customs offices and foreign shipping merchants to comply with them. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Foreign ships applying for an inland port license should apply to the local Maritime Administration Bureau for inspection and measurement and obtain a certificate, and take it to the customs for transfer application, or directly apply to the local Maritime Administration Bureau for verification and issuance. (2) Foreign ships that have obtained an inland port license should report the sailing routes and their time period to the local Maritime Administration Bureau for approval after considering the situation, before they can sail. (3) Foreign ships sailing in inland ports should comply with Chinese maritime administration laws and regulations in the same way as Chinese ships.</p>

<h3>Grand Opening of the Commercial Press's Hongkou Branch</h3>
<p>After the Commercial Press resumed business, it established a branch on Yuyuan Road and Xiafei Road. Recently, to facilitate the purchase of books and other items by residents in the northern district, it added a Hongkou branch at No. 873 North Sichuan Road, which opened yesterday (the 7th) and prepared commemorative gifts. Customers and visitors were endless throughout the day, which was extremely grand. The library originally established a Hongkou branch before the January 28th Incident, and the new branch is located diagonally across from the original site, so as to continue serving old customers.</p>
<h3>The Qin Family Died for Their Principles; Remains Were Placed in Coffins Yesterday Afternoon; Cries of Male and Female Relatives Shook the Sky; Will Be Transported to Wuxi for Burial Together with Qin's Coffin; Gong's Handwritten Last Letter Was Too Painful to Read</h3>
<p>Since the tragedy of the suicide by medicine of the late Qin Lizhai of this newspaper, his wife Madam Gong Yinxia, and their three children occurred the day before yesterday, not only the colleagues of this newspaper expressed great grief, but also people from all walks of life in society were shocked by this unprecedented tragedy. All the details of the incident have been recorded in detail in this newspaper. Now, the examination of the body by the court yesterday, the subsequent encoffining in the Xijin Guild Hall, and the discovery of Madam Gong's handwritten long letter are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Four Bodies Carried to the Place for Examination</h3>
<p>Since the tragedy occurred, all four bodies were immediately notified by the police to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to order the coffin bearers to carry the bodies to the examination place. At the same time, detectives were dispatched to the Qin residence to guard the bodies. Meanwhile, the police reported to the Second Special District Court for examination. Wang Ren, a prosecutor from the Prosecutor's Office, along with forensic doctor Jiang Xuan and clerk Peng, arrived at the office at 10:00 a.m. yesterday for examination. Qin Pingfu, the father of the deceased, fainted after hearing the news in Wuxi, and his foot disease recurred, so he could not move. Therefore, he did not appear in court, and his uncle Qin Chengfu arrived in his place.</p>
<h3>The Father-in-Law Submitted a Written Request for Exemption from Examination</h3>
<p>Chengfu presented a written statement in the name of Qin Pingfu, the general idea of which was that his daughter-in-law, granddaughter, and young grandson had committed suicide by taking poison, which had been certified by doctors, and he requested exemption from examination and permission to claim the bodies for encoffining, etc. After the prosecutor read it, he ordered the forensic doctor to examine each body briefly, and detective Chen reported the details of the investigation at the time. A suicide note written by the deceased in pencil was also presented. It read, "Tell brother Yun and brother, we have taken a lot of poison and there is no way to save us. No need to call a doctor. Call our home immediately [the residence has a phone], and ask my third sister and second sister-in-law to come to Shanghai immediately. This is my last affair, please forgive me, I am confused." There was also a doctor's report at the time, and seventeen small glass bottles. After the prosecutor carefully examined them, and questioned Qin Chengfu briefly, the witness, the maid Tang Aqin, did not arrive.</p>
<h3>After Examination, the Bodies Were Carried to the Xijin Guild Hall</h3>
<p>After the examination, Mr. Wang instructed that Qin Gong, Qin Xisun, Qin Danruo, and Qin Jue were all found to have died from poisoning before death. The bodies were handed over to the corpse owner Qin Chengfu for encoffining. One suicide note, one report from Doctor Fang Mingxu, two large round glass bottles (one containing eleven small glass bottles), and four small flat square glass bottles were kept on file for future reference. After the examination, the corpse owner requested and obtained permission from the police and the court to carry the bodies to the Haining Road Xijin Guild Hall for preparation for encoffining. In addition, the deceased's residence was locked by the police after the tragedy because there were no relatives, only cohabitants. Detectives were sent to guard the doors. After the corpse examination was completed yesterday, the corpse owner requested the police to withdraw the detectives and inspect the deceased's belongings in order to organize them. Finally, the prosecutor briefly reviewed the examination form of Doctor Fang Mingxu. The examination form of Doctor Fang is copied as follows: "At 6:40 a.m. on May 6, someone from No. 103, Xinling Village, French Concession, came to the clinic and said that the Qin family had been poisoned by coal gas and asked me to go to rescue them quickly. Because I had not gotten out of bed yet, I immediately told him to leave his address and return quickly, to open the windows and doors of the patient's bedroom as much as possible, and to quickly move the more seriously ill to the sun deck, and I would arrive quickly. I got out of bed, still in my pajamas, and hurried downstairs. I met the person who came to me again (because the patient was close to my neighbor, it was so fast), and immediately carried my medical kit and followed him. When I first entered the door, I felt no coal gas smell, and there was no coal stove. I quickly put down my medical kit and saw four people lying on beds. On the big bed was a middle-aged woman, about thirty or forty years old, with no breath, no pulse, and a pale face, and I determined that she was already dead. A young girl of about eighteen or nineteen years old, with a pale face, dilated pupils, no response, and purple-blue lips, was breathing rapidly, had a frequent pulse, was unconscious, had no sensation, and was dying. Upon inspecting the small bed near the window, I saw two men lying there. The one lying inside the bed was younger, about thirteen or fourteen years old, with closed eyes and no sound, and a stiff body. I determined that he had been dead for a long time. Upon inspecting the one lying on the outside bed, about fifteen or sixteen years old, he was breathing urgently, with a slightly purple face, slightly protruding eyeballs, dilated pupils, no response, and purple-blue lips, clenched teeth, foaming at the mouth, a faint but rapid pulse, unconscious, and no sensation. I determined that the dead were already dead, and the living had no way to return to life. But in order to do everything possible, I told the person who came that he should urgently call the hospital to send an ambulance to save a glimmer of hope. Moreover, these were definitely not symptoms of coal gas poisoning. After carefully inspecting the bottles placed on the table, I saw that the stopper of one bottle had been opened, and not much had been used. The bottle was labeled Chlosform (Chloroform), and the small amount used might have been caused by evaporation, and it was not the cause of death. Upon inspecting the table in the outer room, I saw a large pile of empty tubes of Medinal (Medinal). It was said that there were fifteen tubes. I then realized that the cause of death was this. At this time, there were a lot of people around, and there was no way to treat them, so I told them to send them to the hospital quickly to save them just in case. I then said goodbye and returned to the hospital."</p>
<h3>Hoping for Resurrection, Doctors Were Called for Trial Diagnosis</h3>
<p>After the examination procedures were completed, the family hired a truck to carry all the bodies to the Haining Road Xijin Guild Hall. The time was already 4:45. Unexpectedly, just as everything was ready and they were about to start encoffining, a relative of the Qin family suddenly saw that Madam Gong's face was lifelike and showed no signs of death. He actually declared in public, roughly saying, "I (the relative himself) heard people say that last year someone who committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills was found to have no signs of death on his face three days after death. He went to Renji Hospital for treatment and was resurrected. This is very similar to Madam Gong today. Why not give it a try?" The relatives heard this and believed it to be true, so they rushed to drive to Renji Hospital. After registering at the hospital, a doctor followed the person to the Xijin Guild Hall. After examining the body, he was very angry and said, "Why did you ask me to come and see a dead person?" He ordered someone to go to the hospital to reason with them. The Qin family had no choice but to send someone to accompany the doctor back to the hospital to express their apology. The doctor then called it bad luck and gave up. This is really a rare occurrence in the tragedy.</p>
<h3>After the Four Coffins Were Sealed, Relatives and Friends Wept Bitterly</h3>
<p>At about 5:00, they put on clothes and coffined them in order at the Xijin Guild Hall. By about 5:30, they had all been sealed. The relatives who arrived, such as their uncles, aunts, sisters, etc., all cried bitterly, and the scene was so tragic that everyone who saw it shed tears. It has been decided to hold a funeral at the guild hall at 3:00 p.m. today. Relatives and friends will not be notified separately. Passports have also been pre-obtained, and the coffins will be transported to Wuxi for burial together with the coffin of Lizhai.</p>
<h3>Inventory of Belongings Discovered a Last Letter</h3>
<p>When the examination procedures were completed, the Qin family opened the door to the third floor of No. 103 Xinling Village, and while inventorying the belongings, they found a long letter of about a thousand words in a drawer, which was written by Madam Gong herself. The wording was mournful and poignant, every word a tear, and it was too painful to read.</p>
<h3>龔氏遺書一字一淚</h3>
<p>Mr. Gong Baoqiang (name Xianglin, manager of Jinan Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank), the cousin of Madame Lizhai, sent a handwritten letter of testament from Madame Lizhai, entrusting us to publish it. The letter describes the process of her decision to die, and her views are very insightful, but also too tragic. The original text is copied below:</p>
<p>Oh, Lizhai! You are dead! Who will I share joy with from now on? Who will I consult about sorrows? Who will resolve doubts with? Who will decide on choices with? I am like a sheep separated from its flock, a boat without a rudder,茫茫然 not knowing where to go. You once said that if I died, you could not live alone. How could you die and I live alone? And yet you abandoned me and died!</p>
<p>I remember the day the news of the September 18th Incident reached Shanghai. You returned from the newspaper office, your despair indescribable, unable to sleep all night. The next morning, you didn't even eat. You said to me, "The state of the country is such that we can no longer do anything. Why be slaves of a fallen nation? Why not take our children on a small boat, sail to the middle of the river, break the bottom of the boat, and let it sink?" I said no. I said we are among the highest of the intellectual class. When the country is in this state, we should work harder. Even if we cannot turn back the overwhelming tide, we can still preserve some vitality. How can we simply be stimulated and imitate the recklessness of the common man? You were just speaking in a moment of indignation, and you never mentioned it again. Now I deeply regret not carrying out your words and dying together!</p>
<p>Lizhai, I decided a few days ago to die with our children, but now I have changed my mind. You only left behind these three children, and you always said they are all talented. I must do my best to teach and educate them, to make them bloom with brilliant flowers and bear bright fruit, to glorify their family. Then your lifelong hard work will not be in vain. I think this is a responsibility I cannot shirk. I cannot die until this responsibility is fulfilled. One person should not die, let alone die with their children. My mind is made up, may you bless me silently.</p>
<p>Oh, Lizhai! If you have any requests, why not tell me but tell others? And to say that I should live in Xixi, what is your intention? Returning to Xixi means leaving this house. We both planned and managed this house from top to bottom, pouring in countless efforts. Even the doorbell and mailbox were made by our own hands. Everything in the room was placed by your hand. Returning to Xixi would mean dismantling everything one by one, as if you were dying again. How could I bear it? Now that you are dead, I see nothing in this room that is not your blood. I would rather die in this room than bear to leave it. You must know my heart. Those who ask for it must be ghosts impersonating your name. Is that so? Why don't you tell me?</p>
<p>Since I am alive, I must find a solution to our financial problems. What you left behind, after deducting funeral expenses, currently amounts to a little less than two thousand yuan. The funeral separation gift is a little more than one thousand yuan, totaling three thousand yuan. Zijin can earn two hundred and forty yuan a year, and Shen Bao newspaper is willing to subsidize twenty yuan a month for three years. That means we have forty yuan in expenses each month. If the house doesn't remain vacant for too long, then daily expenses can be managed. If Xi Neng can get a scholarship and Duan Qiong can get a free quota, then we can temporarily solve the problem.</p>
<p>You never wanted to ask for anything from anyone in your life, and neither do I. That is why I have tried my best to economize in normal times, but now I am still unfortunate enough to be in this situation. It's truly heartbreaking. The newspaper office will provide five hundred yuan in compensation, Shi Fu one hundred yuan, colleagues more than five hundred and eighty yuan, and three years of subsidies, totaling seven hundred and twenty yuan, for a total of one thousand nine hundred. Two hundred yuan can be regarded as ordinary gifts, and the rest is purely for assistance. When Duan becomes established, I will have him add up to two thousand and donate it back to the newspaper office. As for what you left behind, you once aspired to set up a small chemistry laboratory. If our children can carry on your ambition, I will use this as a foundation. Otherwise, I will donate it in your name to any school laboratory as a permanent memorial to you. Last night, I dreamt of black death. Did you know that war could not be avoided, so you told us to die? My uncle has young children, and my aunt has two younger sisters. Their meager property is not enough to keep them from freezing or starving. Our lives are of no benefit, only causing our elders to worry. It's better to die than to live. Oh, Lizhai, I'm afraid my plans may not succeed. Even if they do, who can guarantee that our children will not die? If one of our children unfortunately dies, how could I bear it? I have no choice but to pray to God to show me clearly. I have decided to die with my children. How pitiful, this innocent and lively Jue, also to die with us. But I love him so much, even more unwilling to abandon him and die!</p>
<p>Alas, Lizhai, you once said that the world today does not keep good seeds. I once said that rather than exist in mediocrity, it is better to be excellent and extinct. Combining our words to predict the future, it is certain that your lineage will be cut off. God's will and human affairs are already clear. Why must I go against the tide?</p>
<p>Lizhai, the idea of dying together really came from you. It has caused me a lot of suffering, but it is also my great fortune. Otherwise, I might be held back by my children and unable to bear to die!</p>
<p>I originally planned to organize your writings before I died, but every time I saw your handwriting, my heart was cut like a knife, so I put it aside. Now that I have decided to die on the fifth, I cannot take care of it. It is a real regret, but there is nothing I can do. I hope you will forgive me.</p>
<p>Every time I think of the tragic state after we die, I almost change my mind. That is why I have been delayed until today. I don't know how much hesitation it took, but in the end I couldn't control myself. It is fate. I hope my aunt and uncle will not grieve. You must know that people cannot fight fate. I have prayed day and night that this tragedy would not happen, but it was ultimately impossible. My heart aches like a knife as I face death. I feel that I should not die with my children, but Lizhai started this idea first, and the children refuse to leave me, and I cannot abandon them. I have become like riding a tiger. Because of this, I have wanted to commit suicide and stopped more than ten times. I have also decided to abandon this idea of suicide and work hard, but my coughing up blood and lung disease really make me feel discouraged. I think that sooner or later I will die anyway. Let people laugh or scold.</p>
<p>There are many Beths in the world, peaceful and shy, holding back and retreating, not willing to show their faces until they have no choice, working to help others, and people do not see their efforts and sacrifices, until the cold insects under the window finish singing, the sun sets in the west, and the brilliance suddenly disappears, leaving only a silence for people to mourn. (See Little Women)</p>
<p>Isn't this a portrait of Lizhai? But this kind of behavior is suitable for women, not for men, especially not for the world today. Therefore, Lizhai died in blind sacrifice. Heaven is really responsible for it. What can be said?</p>
<p>Two packages of books are for Xisun to return to Wu Xuefen (Zaiyuan's daughter). If others don't recognize her, please ask Zhaomei to send them.</p>
<p>Our corpses can still be placed in the Xijin Cemetery for funerals. It can save some trouble. The table lamp can be returned to Jian Di.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Over Temple Property Dispute at Longhua Temple: Xingkong Sues to Confirm Contract Invalidity; Two Defendants Appear in Court to Provide Details of House Construction; Case Rescheduled for Retrial in Fourteen Days</h3>
<p>The ancient Longhua Temple in the western suburbs of this city, built by the Eastern Wu emperor Chiwu, is the oldest and largest Buddhist temple in Shanghai. During the March pilgrimage, men and women from Jiangnan gather here, and the scene is no less grand than that of Tianzhu. It has now been taken back and managed by the Buddhist Association, which has selected Xingkong, a high-ranking monk from Mount Emei in Sichuan, to be the abbot. He came to Shanghai this year, and the people of Shanghai have a plan to revive Longhua. The temple property must be cleared and checked, which has led to lawsuits.</p>
<h3>Borrowing Money to Build Houses</h3>
<p>Previously, Longhua Temple was headed by Yuanzhao, a monk from Ninghai, Zhejiang, starting in the seventh year of the Republic of China. It changed hands at the beginning of last year. During the period in between, there were first warlord fights and military occupation, which caused pilgrims to avoid the area and led to a lack of revenue. Then, the market was sluggish, and construction required funds. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it was proposed to build seventy-six houses on a large open space in front of the temple to collect rent to increase temple property. However, due to financial constraints, Yuanzhao borrowed 17,500 silver dollars from Hu Suji, also known as Hu Zecheng, from the same hometown, and purchased materials from the mountains of Ninghai and transported them to Shanghai before the project was completed. At that time, a note of debt was made to Hu with a fixed term. Later, since there was no such large sum of money to repay, the houses were transferred to Hu Suji. Yuanzhao then retreated to become the landlord, and Hu paid 200 silver dollars in land rent annually for the temple. The house and land would not be returned to the temple until the twenty-second year (deducted until the fortieth year of the Republic of China).</p>
<h3>Suspicious Contract</h3>
<p>Therefore, after Monk Xingkong became the abbot, he believed that this temple property had been damaged by the former abbot and others, and he should recover the due benefits and cancel the land lease contract. Therefore, he hired lawyers Pan Zhensheng and Yuan Xilian to sue in the civil court of the local court to confirm that the contract was invalid, listing Monk Yuanzhao and Hu Suji as joint defendants, and citing Ji Zhukang, the local land protector, as a witness, pointing out that the seventy-six houses were transformed from barracks at that time, and that Hu Suji was a clerk hired by Yuanzhao, living by the temple, accusing the contract of being incomplete and untrue. After the court notified the defendants to defend themselves, Hu Suji hired lawyer Chen Wenzhao to defend himself, saying that Hu was a graduate of the Zhejiang Public Law College and held prominent positions in both political and legal circles, so how could he be called a lowly person? He also presented the contract as evidence. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the local court summoned the witnesses. Judge Wang Run presided over the hearing in the second court. The plaintiff, Xingkong, did not arrive, but lawyer Pan Zhensheng attended the court as his representative.</p>
<h3>Absconding With Money</h3>
<p>The lawyer stated that the plaintiff was 72 years old, from Mount Emei in Sichuan, and the abbot of Longhua Temple. The former abbot, Yuanzhao, absconded with public funds from the temple in October of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. The local public groups have submitted petitions to the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate, but because Yuanzhao's address is unknown, he has not been brought to justice. At that time, the temple lacked an abbot, so the Shanghai Buddhist Association selected the plaintiff to be the abbot of Longhua Temple on November 7 of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. The interior was in chaos, and he was in the process of reorganizing it. Because of the rent collection, a lawsuit suddenly arose over the temple's houses, and it was discovered that the rent collector, Hu Suji, had presented a mortgage management rent collection contract to the court. After investigation, it was found that the contract was forged by the defendant Monk Yuanzhao and the defendant Hu Suji in collusion. Now, the false and illegal points are stated:</p>
<h3>Invalid Contract</h3>
<p>(1) False points: It is stated in the mortgage contract that the houses along the road were built due to the Longhua Temple's funds, but the 21 bungalows on the east side of the temple in front of the road, the barracks on the west side of the temple were demolished and rebuilt in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, and the 19 bungalows on the west side of the temple in front of the road were also demolished and rebuilt in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, and the 15 bungalows on the south side of the temple in front of the road were demolished and rebuilt in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. The others were all gradually modified to become what they are today, so there was no need to borrow a huge amount of money, and it should be a conspiracy to forge and infringe upon public property. In addition, Hu Suji appeared in court in the case of pursuing rent arrears, which was witnessed by the local citizens. This person is the former abbot Monk Yuanzhao's employee. Where did he get the huge amount of money to lend? Therefore, public opinion was in an uproar and everyone was willing to testify. (2) Legal points: The defendants forged the mortgage contract in July of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the Regulations for Supervising Temples had not yet been promulgated and implemented. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan No. 81 on May 4 of the eighteenth year, if the abbot of a temple pawned temple property to others before the promulgation of the Regulations for Managing Temples, according to the old regulations (Regulations for Managing Temples promulgated in the fourth year of the Republic of China and revised in the tenth year), its legal act is still invalid. Therefore, the mortgage contract signed by Yuanzhao and Hu Suji, regardless of whether it is forged, is invalid and self-invalidating. For the sake of preserving temple property and respecting the law, and out of compassion of our Buddha, the plaintiff will temporarily retain the criminal prosecution and request confirmation of the contract's invalidity through civil means.</p>
<h3>Relationship of Friends</h3>
<p>At this point, Hu Suji provided his testimony, stating his full name as Hu Zecheng, aged 44. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Yuanzhao, needed funds for the construction of the city houses in front of the temple, and he purchased a large amount of wood in his hometown of Ninghui. He entrusted him to borrow 17,500 silver dollars, stating that it would be delivered at the Hexing Shun Charcoal Shop in Wangjia Wharf, and Yuanzhao issued a receipt stating a five-year repayment period with an annual interest rate of 1%. His hometown friends Zhang Chunfu and Zhang Peifu witnessed it on the spot. Only Chunfu has passed away, but Peifu can testify. He and Yuanzhao were childhood friends, a pure friendship. Yuanzhao used to be the abbot of Fuquan Temple in Ninghai, not far from his home, and they often visited each other. He graduated from Zhejiang Public Law College in the second year of the Republic of China. Later, because the loan was overdue and not repaid, he had no choice but to change the agreement to lease the land to build houses. He personally went to collect the rent several times, and Yuanzhao accompanied him out of landlord courtesy. How can he be called an employee? This is clearly slander. The contract for leasing the land to build houses was for a term of twenty-two years, and the house and land would be returned to the temple. The principal and interest did not need to be repaid, and the annual land rent of one hundred yuan would also increase the temple's profits, without causing any damage. It is different from the method of pawning and does not apply to the provisions of the Temple Regulations. He requested that the claims be refuted.</p>
<h3>Managing and Clearing Up</h3>
<p>Monk Yuanzhao, aged 48, from Ninghai, stated that he took charge of Longhua Temple in the seventh year of the Republic of China and left in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. Due to the troops coming and going over the years, the temple was in an irreparable state. There were a total of sixty to seventy monks in the temple, and he had clearly handed everything over to the Buddhist Association before leaving. When asked about the construction of the houses, he provided a testimony similar to Hu Suji's. At this point, the witness Ji Zhukang stated that he lived at No. 224 Xizhen and served as the local land protector, which had been passed down for four generations. He had been the land protector in the twelfth and thirteenth years of the Republic of China. Monk Xingkong did not know him. Today, he was testifying because the Party Department's Guard Corps blamed him for not taking care of things.</p>
<h3>Transforming Barracks</h3>
<p>There were a total of one hundred and sixty barracks in front of the temple, which were built in the tenth year of the Republic of China by Zhang Muhan, the head of the legion of He Fenglin. He could now prove that the city houses were transformed from the barracks, and Hu Suji could also prove that he helped Yuanzhao write fundraising materials and other miscellaneous matters in the temple. After both parties were questioned, Hu Suji requested a postponement of twenty days for further questioning because he wanted to return to his hometown. The judge granted a retrial in two weeks and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zongyi Arrested for Absconding With Embezzled Funds; Formerly Served as Comprador for a Japanese Bank; Private Embezzlement of Funds Worth 300,000</h3>
<p>Zheng Zongyi, from Guangdong, was a doctor. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, he served as the comprador for the Japanese-owned Dehua Bank (i.e., Deutsch-Asiatische Bank). When he left his position, he privately embezzled 100,000 yen and other items, worth approximately 300,000, and absconded without a trace. Although the bank reported the case to the authorities and requested an arrest, nothing was gained. Recently, the bank received a telegram from its Macau branch stating that Zheng had come to Shanghai. The Dehua Bank reported to the police, ordering a secret investigation. The general patrol room suddenly received two arrest warrants, No. 2293 and No. 2294, from the First Special Court on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, which was entrusted by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate to assist in the arrest of Zheng Zongyi. His residence was located at No. 11 Gengfu Lane, North Jiangxi Road. At 8:00 a.m. on the 5th, Chinese Detective Lu Gensheng executed the arrest warrant, arrested Zheng, and seized five shares of Tianjin Zhongyuan Company stock worth 5,000 silver dollars, two seals, a loan note for 16,500 silver dollars, and thirteen letters, which were taken back to the patrol room for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zheng Zongyi hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The patrol room lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the patrol room had not yet fully understood the case, so it was difficult to make any statement regarding the local court's request for transfer. He requested permission to postpone the hearing. Judge Qian Hongye granted the request and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for Wednesday morning.</p>
<h3>Egg Freight Rates Reduced by One Grade, Effective May 5</h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Railways received an instruction from the Ministry of Railways stating that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce had telegraphed on behalf of the Egg Factory Association, requesting a reduction in freight rates for exported eggs. After investigation, it was found that the PingSui Railway had been approved to reduce the rates for egg products by one grade. This matter concerns the promotion of domestic products and the support of rural areas. It is hereby ordered to follow the common goods classification table, listing fresh or preserved eggs as Grade 3, dried or powdered egg yolks as Grade 2 when packed in boxes and Grade 3 when packed wet in barrels, and dried or powdered egg whites as Grade 2 when packed in boxes and Grade 3 when packed wet in barrels. A temporary reduction of one grade in the rates for three months is provisionally approved as a special low-season price for each route. In addition to this instruction, it is hereby ordered to comply and report the handling situation and implementation date for record. After receiving the order, the Directorate General of Railways ordered the Vehicle Department to reply, and the implementation began on May 5.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Dental Association Spring General Membership Meeting Minutes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dental Association has been formally established for almost a year. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, at 6:00 p.m., the Spring Representative Conference was held at the Shanghai YMCA. Members Wang Rongchu, Mao Zhixiang, He Ruisheng, He Zhenyang, Qin Shaozhou, Sun Xiamin, Xie Yingzhai, Chu Zhikang, Huang Rende, Yan Dazhi, and dozens of others attended. Representatives Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Department and Su Jielang from the Municipal Health Bureau attended the meeting. Sun Xiamin was elected as the chairman, and Yan Dazhi recorded the minutes. After the formalities, the chairman gave the opening speech. The representative Mao from the Municipal Party Department then gave a speech, stating that teeth are very important for human health, but the general public generally ignores them. The organization of your association is the first dental group in our country. I sincerely hope that in addition to protecting the interests of the members, you will work harder to improve the dental welfare of the public. The representative Su from the Health Bureau gave a speech, stating that in the future, your association can advise and correct the various exaggerated and unrealistic advertisements in the dental community of this city in the name of the association, and especially hope that your members will lead by example and unite internally to promote the progress of the dental industry in our country. The chairman then reported on the association's work, and a dinner was held. The association's newsletter was distributed, and representatives from the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory distributed dental application drugs on the spot.</p>

<h3>Extremely Hot Weather Yesterday</h3>
<p>Highest Temperature 89 Degrees</p>
<p>The weather in this city has been quite mild recently. Although there has been drizzle in the past few days, it has not been very cold. However, the weather suddenly changed yesterday, and it was extremely hot. Pedestrians on the road were mostly dressed in light clothing, and the asphalt road was melting due to the heat, just like in summer. The highest temperature on the thermometer at noon was 89 degrees. It gradually became warmer in the evening, and the thermometer only showed a little over 70 degrees.</p>
<h3>Large Shipment of Russian Cosmetics Arrives in Shanghai; Attracts Attention of Japanese; Japanese Fear Market Intrusion</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the import of Soviet goods into China was the highest for gasoline last year. At that time, the British and American companies in this city were greatly affected by the competition. Recently, Russia has also imported surplus cosmetics and spices into China. Two Soviet cargo ships recently arrived with 650 boxes of cosmetics and spices. Although the packaging of these goods is not as luxurious as those from Europe and the United States, their low price and good quality can indeed invade the market in this city.</p>
<h3>Xiangtan Returns to Shanghai Safely; Japanese Ship Bottom Broken in Two Holes; Japanese Arrives in Shanghai for Repairs</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Yangtze River steamer Xiangtan was coming from Yichang and Shashi this time. On the 1st of this month, when traveling to the river near Huangshi Port, the ship ran aground on a reef due to rising water and fog. The engine room and the bow compartment of the ship were hit by the reef. The bottom of the bow compartment and the bottom of the engine room were each broken with a hole. At that time, the ship was flooded, and the situation was quite dangerous. The shipowner telegraphed Shanghai for help. Later, the chief shipowner in Hankou was sent to inspect and rescue the ship. Since there was no cement on board, it was impossible to repair the leak. The second comprador of the ship was sent to buy several barrels of cement in Huangshi Port Town, which was brought back to the ship. Then, workers were sent to try to fill the two holes in the engine room and the bow of the first class, and pump out the accumulated water. Wood planks were used to protect the holes, and then the ship was towed out of the shallow water and sailed back to Shanghai during the high tide. It arrived in Shanghai at 9:30 yesterday morning. After unloading the cargo, it will be docked for major repairs. The ship is temporarily out of service.</p>
<h3>Wife of University Professor Files for Divorce in Japanese Court; Defendant Fails to Appear, Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>Kim Youliu, a Suzhou native and professor at Jiaotong University and Guanghua University, residing at No. 14 Ping’an Lane, Route Paul Henry, French Concession, was sued by his wife, Li Qingwei, who was represented by lawyers Ji Yan, Yu Zhong, and Luo, in the Second Special District Court, seeking separation from her husband, Kim Youliu, and requesting alimony. Yesterday was the scheduled hearing, but the defendant still did not appear. Judge Li Liang presided over the hearing in the Seventh Tribunal. The judge announced that the case had been reopened for debate due to evidence presented by the plaintiff's lawyer. The plaintiff's witnesses, Kim Houchen, Zhang Shilian, and Zhang Rongchen, did not appear. Only the witness Zhang Qiyun reported, stating that Zhang Shilian was his father and unable to attend due to old age. However, he was somewhat familiar with the case. Initially, the couple had a good relationship, but problems arose due to Kim's extramarital affair. Kim Youliu sought a divorce but was unsuccessful and then avoided her. Li Qingwei was left destitute. On one occasion, Li waited for her husband in front of Jiaotong University, intending to reason with him. She waited a long time and cried. Students learned of the situation and were indignant. After a while, Kim Youliu left the school in a car. Students surrounded him and questioned him, leading to a dispute. Since then, Kim has resented Li even more, determined to achieve a divorce. Zhang Rongchen and others mediated, and Kim Youliu offered 10,000 yuan for a divorce, but Li refused, so no agreement was reached. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant's presence was necessary, as there might be hope for reconciliation. The defendant's lawyer previously stated that the defendant was in Tokyo and could return to Shanghai soon. Why has he not appeared today? The lawyer requested that the defendant be ordered to appear. The defendant's lawyer, Cai Liucheng, stated that the defendant had recently obtained a position in Tokyo and might find it difficult to appear immediately. He requested a postponement so that his lawyer could notify the defendant. Judge Li then postponed the hearing to the 28th of this month.</p>

After verification, the registration period began tomorrow morning. At that time, unemployed rickshaw pullers went to the Traffic Office to register according to the form. Because rickshaw pullers had been unemployed for a long time, representatives repeatedly requested that they be allowed to find guarantors, affix seals, and be issued licenses immediately so that they could operate in May. This was also permitted. All rickshaw license plates were issued at that time, but the rickshaw license certificates must be exchanged for the old May licenses and the October and November licenses in June in order to be officially issued.</p>

<h3>Tan Zhuo Eager to Recognize His Father; Previous Two Lawsuits Dismissed; Third Request to Restore Father-Son Relationship</h3>
<p>Tan Zhuo, currently an investigator with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, is the eldest son of Tan Jingu, residing at No. 582 Jingxing Lane, Qipu Road. However, due to his lack of ambition since childhood, he was disliked by his parents. In 1921, Tan Zhuo was already of age but still did not pursue a proper career. At that time, Tan Jingu believed that this son was incorrigible. To avoid being implicated in the future, he published a statement disowning his son and filed it with the former Mixed Court. From then on, father and son became strangers. After being expelled, Tan Zhuo led a vagrant life. After a long time, he suddenly realized his mistakes and tried to make amends to regain his parents' favor. At that time, Guangdong was reforming its military, and patriotic individuals flocked to it. Tan Zhuo followed suit and went to Guangdong. He was admitted to the Whampoa Military Academy, received military training in the Three Principles of the People, and joined the National Revolutionary Army after graduation to participate in the Northern Expedition. He abandoned his pen for the army, fought in Jiangxi and Hubei, and achieved some success. In 1930, he retired and returned to Shanghai. Having been away from home for many years and neglecting his parental duties, he returned home to ask his father not to hold past grievances against him so that he could still serve him. However, Tan Jingu remained adamant and refused to recognize him as his son. Tan Zhuo filed a lawsuit in court to confirm the parent-child relationship, hoping for legal relief. However, the result of the trial was a loss. His determination to recognize his father did not waver. In recent years, in addition to serving as an investigator with the Public Security Bureau, he also served as the Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Guangzhen Charity Association and the Deputy Manager of the Hanhua Water and Electricity Engineering Company. He also married and had children, establishing a family at No. 252 Minti Ni Yin Road in the concession. However, he still felt uneasy because he could not fulfill his duties as a son. Moreover, his parents are now old, and the time to repay their kindness is running out. Therefore, he once again begged his parents through relatives and friends to withdraw their decision, but they still could not forgive him. Therefore, he hired Wu Zhiping and Peng Wangye as lawyers to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that Tan Jingu's declaration of disowning his son be revoked, arguing that the father-son relationship is inherent in nature and cannot be severed at will. The defendant's previous declaration of disowning was merely a form of punishment, and the father-son relationship still exists. The national criminal policy still has provisions for probation, parole, and amnesty to give criminals a chance to rehabilitate themselves. Parental love should not prevent recovery. The plaintiff stated that his lawsuit was purely for the sake of fulfilling his filial duties and that he had no intention of seeking any property. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan held a hearing. The defendant also hired lawyer Dong Yu to defend him, stating that the plaintiff had previously filed two lawsuits, both of which were dismissed. Therefore, this third lawsuit should not be accepted and should still be rejected. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that the previous lawsuits were proactive confirmation suits, while this is a formative suit. The subject matter of the lawsuits is different, and the legal relationship is also different. He requested that the hearing proceed. The court then ordered that a decision be made on the afternoon of the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Foreign Banks on the Bund Close for Three and a Half Days During Spring Racing Season</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the Spring Racing Season. Foreign banks and firms on the Bund were open for half a day in the morning and closed in the afternoon until tomorrow. Full-day business will resume on the 10th. Chinese banks used to close in the same way as foreign banks, but this year they are operating as usual. However, their collections are constrained by foreign banks, so they are naturally slower.</p>

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the second regular meeting was held at the clubhouse at No. 890 Haining Road. Over 20 people attended, including Yu Danhan and Chen Xiaocui. Feng Wenfeng was elected as chairman. Matters such as the progress of the association were discussed, and Li Qiujun, Tang Guanyu, and Yu Danhan were elected as supervisors, and Chen Xiaocui was elected as a standing committee member.

<h3>Ye Jinchu, Veteran Employee of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Passes Away</h3>
<p>Joined the Company in the Second Year of the Guangxu Era</p>
<p>Served for 57 Years</p>
<p>Ye Jinchu of the Ship Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who had served in the company for 57 years, passed away peacefully last night at the age of 78. Department Head Zhao Yuntai has reported this to General Manager Liu Hongsheng and requested a one-time pension be granted in accordance with the service regulations. Ye was a native of Xiangshan, Guangdong, and studied at the Royal College in Hong Kong with Sun Yat-sen. He joined the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as a clerk in the second year of the Guangxu era. Later, he became a member of the Main Ship Department, and later promoted to Deputy Section Chief of the Shipping Department, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. He was diligent in his work. Therefore, although the company underwent reorganization and layoffs, Ye remained in his position as before. During Zhao Tieqiao's time, Ye was transferred to the Shipping Department as a consultant, still receiving his original salary. When Liu Hongsheng took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Ye was in charge of the accounting affairs of the Ship Department. Although he was old, he never made any mistakes in the income and expenditure accounts. Last year, Ye submitted a request to the General Manager to retire due to his advanced age and declining health. According to the company's regulations on veteran employees and the retirement regulations for foreign employees, he could be given a retirement payment of 16,000 yuan for 56 years of service (last year). At that time, the Board of Directors decided to reward him with 4,000 yuan first and retained him in his position, paying him as usual. Ye continued to sign in and work every day. Ye's fourth son is also working in the Ship Department. Yesterday, he reported to Department Head Zhao that his father, Jinchu, had died peacefully in the night of the 5th, leaving behind many children and a meager estate. He requested an advance of 1,000 yuan to cover the funeral expenses. Department Head Zhao immediately reported this to General Manager Liu, detailing Ye's 57 years of service to the company, his death from overwork, and the need to grant a one-time pension in accordance with the employee service regulations to provide relief. Liu Hongsheng has now submitted this case to the Board of Directors for deliberation and resolution.</p>

<h3>Research After the Publication of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka</h3>
<p>The newly published Song Dynasty Shazhu Tripitaka in Shanghai is a photolithographic reproduction of the edition from the Yan Sheng Temple in Pingjiang during the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty. Printed on fine paper in a quarto format, the first batch consists of 50 volumes, originally arranged according to the Thousand Character Classic, from "Wu" (五) and "Chang" (常) to "Gao" (羔) and "Yang" (羊), a total of 50 characters, with each character representing one volume. The Zhenjiang Shaozong Library has researched and identified five advantages: (1) From the colophons, historical facts about the carving can be deduced. The sutras and Buddhist images have the names of the writers, painters, and carvers, with over 20 writers and over 50 carvers. The names of the writers include Huang Yaoshou, a Jinshi from Yun Jian, Wang Chu from Hua Ting, Zhou Changsun, Lü Yizheng, and Shi Zongyuan from Runan, and Zhang Changzong, Shen Mao, with some signing with implied meanings, such as Yu Xianfu, a member of the Hanlin Academy serving as the imperial physician, who wrote at the age of 74, praying for good health and safety; Ni Shizhong of Baiya, Tiantai, who wrote during his students' leisure time. There are also many monks, such as Monk Xing, Bhikshu Zhi Chen, Bhikshu Zhi Kai, Bhikshu Ru Yuan, Bhikshu Hui Ji, Bhikshu Shi An, Bhikshu Shi Xi, Bhikshu Zu Mao, Bhikshu Qing Man, Bhikshu Zhi Zan, and Bhikshu Jing Gong, all of whom are very prominent. The names of the carvers are mostly Zhu Yi, Zhu Zhi Dao, Zhu Zheng Yi, Zhu Ming, Chen Yu Quan, Chen Xiu, Chen Da Chang, Chen Jun Xi, Chen Xiao Lang, Chen Yong He, He Yong Yan, He Hao, He Jun Shi, Xu Shen, Xu Ya, Xu Da You, Zhang Ren, Zhong Wen, Zhong Wu, Huang Sheng, You Ren from Jian’an, You, Xiong Geng, Li Qi, Yu Ji, Ding Chun Nian, Fu Fang, Gong Ri Hua, Ying Zi Hua, Jiang Wen Mao, Zong Rong, Weng Yin Zhi, Weng Xin Zhi, Fan Rong, Fan Mao Qing, Shen Xiu, Feng Niu, Zhao Bi Jian, Liu Ren Zhong, Su Run, Yin Yi Qing, and a person from Nanhai. The names Feng Niu and the person from Nanhai are particularly unique. Buddhist images are placed at the beginning of the sutras. Although there is only one painter, Chen Sheng, there are four carvers: Sun You, Yuan Yu, Chen Ning, and Chen Bo Gong. Only 50 volumes have been seen so far. The engraved characters and painting styles have many unique features. If all 592 volumes are published, their style and system can be traced, and a special monograph on woodblock printing can be created. Book collectors at home and abroad may discover other printed books by these individuals based on the listed names. (2) From the colophons, the changes in social prices can be known. For example, "Sun Shi Niang, granddaughter of Yang Jiu, donated 50 guan of official currency to carve one volume of the 'Perfect Wisdom Sutra of All Buddhas' Realms'," this volume is within the 156th volume, with a total of ten and a half plates. Another example is "Chen Shi Liu Wu Niang, daughter of Hui San, donated 37 guan to carve one volume of the 'Moonlight Boy Sutra'," this volume is within the 159th volume, with a total of seven and a half plates, each plate with five pages, each page with six lines, and each line with seventeen characters, totaling 510 characters. If based on the current rate of 5 yuan per thousand characters carved by Jiang Jun Wenqing of Dangjia Lane, Nanjing, each plate should be worth 2.55 yuan. However, the carving cost in the Song Dynasty was more than 5 guan. From this industry, we can clearly understand the prices at that time and infer the economic situation and the difference from today. (3) From the colophons, we can see the titles of large families, such as "Geng Shi Shi Ba Niang of Can Twelve," "Chu Wu Ba Lang of Nü Yi," "Chu Qi San Chengshi of Nü Si," "Wei Qi Er Xuanjiao," "Liu Shi Qian Shi San Niang." These numbers must be based on their large ranking within the same clan and are also an important relic of the patriarchal organization. (4) From the colophons, we can study the evolution of regional divisions, such as "Shasha Beach North, Second, under the Nineteenth Bao of Changren Xiang, Huating County," "Gu Xuanpu, Fifth Bao of Quanwu Xiang, Kunshan County," "Ziyuantian, Changba Zi, Eighteenth Du, Jiu Yong Xiang, Wujiang County," "Shang Duan of Huangjia Fu, An Xiang, Chongming Shadao, Zongming Prefecture." Whether these divisional names are still used today, and whether there have been any changes, can all be used as a reference for those governing local history. (5) From the colophons, we can express the social thought of the Song Dynasty. The wishes of each person, from a private perspective, are no more than seeking blessings for the deceased and extending life. For the deceased, it is "rebirth in the Pure Land." For extending life, it is "healthy body," "harmonious family," "early recovery from illness." From a public perspective, it is "all sentient beings in the Dharma realm attain complete wisdom" and "everyone increases life and each eliminates disasters," which is quite in line with the modern cultural ideal of Great Harmony. The above is just a brief overview and the sutra text has not yet been read. The sutra text is the most important. According to my speculation, what was carved in the Song Dynasty must be able to correct the errors in the Ming and Qing Dynasty sutra texts. This should await the work of experts. However, under the daily scientific civilization and toxicity, the Buddha's true suchness and ultimate truth have the function of disinfection and shielding. We should study and promote this, which is not only a beautiful thing to assist in political transformation, but also to faithfully contribute this exquisitely carved rare edition from our country's hundreds of years to the world. It is also sufficient to promote national glory. Therefore, since this sutra has been fortunately published, all powerful members of society should promote it, and each county library should purchase one copy for people to browse. The benefits will be great. Most readers today prefer to seek entertainment in novels, and may not necessarily have an interest in studying Buddhism. However, with this public display, it may be possible to guide one success among dozens or hundreds or thousands. Once success is achieved, it can nurture and blossom, making the place colorful and fragrant, and not betraying the wishes of those who purchased this sutra.</p>

<p>The Yizhong Company's Large-Scale Production of Glazed Wall Bricks: In recent years, with the increasing emphasis on hygiene in architectural design in our country, more and more houses are equipped with bathrooms. However, the white glazed wall tiles used in bathrooms are mostly imported, costing two to three million yuan annually, a substantial outflow of funds. Yizhong Machinery Porcelain and Electrical Company, originally manufacturing mosaic floor tiles, recognizing this outflow of profits, began experimenting with machine-made wall tiles five years ago. They hired specialized personnel and purchased new machinery. However, due to the properties of domestically produced clay, initial experiments were unsuccessful. Through the diligent research of their engineers, they gradually improved, and production began last spring. At the end of the year, they added machinery and built a large kiln, all of which are now in order. They now have a large output, with pure white and smooth color, flat and accurate dimensions, and solid quality at affordable prices. It is said that architects and construction companies in Shanghai are continuously placing orders with the company, and supply is barely meeting demand.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I was surprised to read in your newspaper (7th) that the Xinjiang Hui Musical Troupe came to Shanghai to perform, led by Aysha Huqiaoru, sent by the Executive Yuan. After investigation, we, the Xinjiang students studying in Beijing, came to Shanghai to play music, which is purely private in nature and has not been entrusted by the government. I am deeply afraid that false rumors will be spread to the outside world and cause misunderstandings. I hereby solemnly declare that I hope you will grant a correction. Sincerely, To the Editor of Shen Bao, Aysha Huqiaoru, May 7th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read today's municipal news in your newspaper that the experts of the Shipping Cooperation Design Committee will depart for investigation, which stated that the experts will depart to various places for investigation after the registration form is printed. It is not in accordance with the facts. After checking, the survey form of our association will be sent to various shipping companies for completion, and then the experts will be asked to review it, and it will not be distributed to the experts. This is one. This survey form is only asked to be filled in by the companies in this city, which is two. You should be asked to make corrections to clarify the facts. Sincerely, The Shipping Cooperation Design Committee, 23, 5, 7.</p>
<h3>Special Issue: General Situation of the Work of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration in the First Quarter of the 23rd Year (4): Completion of Model Stations</h3>
<p>In order to rectify the work of the stations, the Bureau first designated the six stations of Shangbei, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and the three stations of Shangnan, Jiaxing and Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line as model stations, and began to handle them. Then, the responsible personnel of each station were appointed and required to complete the observation on time. The head of each traffic section formulated an outline for rectifying the order inside and outside the station, and went to each station for inspection together with the police department personnel to discuss and determine the methods for rectifying the parking position of vehicles and banning idlers, and implemented them separately. As for the open spaces near the stations, they have been ordered to be cleaned up and arranged into small gardens according to the terrain, so that the environment can be gradually beautified. It has been established in Nanjing, Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi and Hangzhou. At the end of this quarter, the stations and along the Dansong section of the Beijing-Shanghai Line have planted more than 52,000 seedlings.</p>
<h3>Rectify Shanghai North Station</h3>
<p>Among them, the Shanghai North Station is especially crowded and mixed with people, and it is related to the views of Chinese and foreigners, so it should not be ignored. The internal layout and the surrounding environment were actively rectified when the station building was repaired last year. In addition to eliminating vendors on the platform and strictly prohibiting station servants from being arrogant to guests, there are several more important points in this quarter, such as (1) the luggage room was re-allocated, and the weighing place, accounting place, ticket writing place, and ticket issuing place were connected together, and a special luggage weighing ticket was prepared with a number strip attached, so that the luggage entering the station can be weighed, filled in, and the number strip torn and handed over to the passengers. After purchasing the ticket, they can pay the fee and collect the luggage ticket by presenting the strip to save their waiting time; (2) the police officers stationed by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau inspect the passengers to prevent the smuggling of prohibited or dangerous goods, etc., but it is inevitable that the passengers will be inconvenienced. After consultation with the Public Security Bureau, it was agreed that passengers who are not suspicious will be exempted from inspection. If women must be inspected, it should be done indoors, and the actions must be peaceful during the inspection to avoid misunderstandings; (3) The original telephone exchange was destroyed during the Sino-Japanese Incident in the middle of the previous year. The 14 telephone sets of the American Shanghai Telephone Company were installed to facilitate official business, but the efficiency was low and the cost was high, which was not economical. Therefore, another plan to renovate the exchange was proposed and approved by the Ministry. Then, the National Currency Silver 8,100 yuan was handed over to Siemens Electric Factory to undertake the project. It is estimated that Shangbei Station has 80-door co-power exchange, and leased 10 pairs of relay lines from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to the concession, and two pairs of telephone lines from its Zhabei Branch. It temporarily installed Shangbei Station, Shangbei Machine Factory and MacKen Road Station, with a total of 45 sub-machines. The Wusong Machine Factory has another 20-door magneto exchange, which is connected to Shangbei Station, and another 13 sub-machines. Since then, the monthly recurring expenses are only 600 yuan, which can actually save 500 yuan per month compared with the previous month, or 6,000 yuan per year. The communication efficiency is several times higher than before.</p>
<h3>Rectify Shanghai South Station</h3>
<p>The location of Shanghai South Station is also very important. However, due to historical reasons, the equipment is mostly outdated. At the end of January of this year, the Traffic Department specially convened a meeting to improve the station and decided on events related to facilitating merchants, such as expanding the fourth-class ticket office, such as adding a fourth-class waiting room, such as installing path signs in front of the overpass, such as extending platform No. 1, such as setting up timetable and price list frames, etc. Regarding maintaining appearance and order, such as relocating public newspaper reading signs, such as adding porter luggage price signs, such as transforming on-board ticket replacement signs, such as ordering the relocation of vendors in the back door, etc., are all in progress separately.</p>
<h3>Improve Songhu Branch Line</h3>
<p>The Songhu Branch Line of the Beijing-Shanghai Road is the first railway created in our country and has a long history. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government moved the city center area, and the status of the line has become more and more important. Therefore, the improvement of its business to meet the needs of the times and the environment is an urgent task. It has been decided (1) to abolish all first-class seats, regardless of grade, and charge the same fee as the third class. On the one hand, the vehicles will be increased and equipped, and the cleanliness will be improved; (2) The overhanging lines and platforms of each station that are too short will be extended to facilitate traffic intersection and passenger boarding and alighting; (3) Extend the railings of each station to both ends of the branch road, and set up fences to prevent passengers without tickets from passing through; (4) Improve the locomotives and coal to avoid delays; (5) Repair the original steam locomotives to increase the number of shifts. Each relationship department is processing separately.</p>
<h3>Stipulate the Time to Open the Ticket Window</h3>
<p>The time to open the ticket window at each station is related to the convenience of the journey and the order of the station. Since the issuance of tourist round-trip tickets, the number of passengers coming and going at major stations has increased day by day, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. The ticket window should be opened earlier to share the congestion. Therefore, it is stipulated that the six stations of Shangbei, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, and the three stations of Shangnan, Hangzhou and Ningbo on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line, should open at least one window all day, and open other ticket windows two hours before the departure of each passenger car. In addition, each station should open the window one hour before the departure of each passenger car, and the responsible personnel of each station should be responsible for supervising the implementation at any time. For major stations with a large number of ticket windows, the original arrangement of a certain window selling tickets for certain stations is now changed to any window selling tickets for any station, and the tickets purchased by passengers can take any equivalent train on the same day to increase the convenience of the journey.

<h3>Reading News: List of Contents of the Eighth Issue of the Guidance Department of the Shen Bao Circulation Library (1) Small Foreword (2) Three Pieces of Information This Week (3) Four Mailbox Letters Small Foreword</h3>
<p>Recently, from the letters we have seen that our reading life has taken a step forward. In the "Reading Questions and Answers", there are now texts such as "Questions after reading the Quarterly Journal of Labor Problems" and "Questions after reading the History of the New Chinese Literature Movement Materials", which is a very gratifying phenomenon. This is no longer a purely theoretical study, but has entered a more realistic understanding of theory.</p>
<p>In the past, many readers asked us to help him solve the difficulties that occurred in reading magazines and newspapers. Although we have replied one by one, we now think that this kind of reply should also be published in the newspaper. Because this is a general request, there must be more people reading magazines and newspapers than reading specialized books, so it should be answered publicly.</p>
<p>The introduction and criticism of books is now imminent. We receive inquiries about "How is the content of a certain book" which account for an absolute majority of other letters. Naturally, this book work cannot be done by a few of us, but since few people in the cultural world are doing it now, we have to come out and take some responsibility. Therefore, the future "Reading Questions and Answers" should meet the factual requirements, and I am afraid that it will be biased in this direction day by day! Undoubtedly, we believe this is a progressive phenomenon.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that all readers of the Library, everyone will mobilize and point out all the dissatisfaction and errors found in the books they have read (regardless of any nature), and send them to the Ministry for reference. At the same time, we also hope that friends in the society who have the same interests as us can provide us with some publishing news and book and newspaper reviews.</p>
<p>We urgently hope that everyone can pay attention to the theories in all the current popular publications and all the books on practical issues, but at the same time, you must have your own theory and vision, and read it with a critical eye.</p>
<p>As for another phenomenon in recent letters, the questions raised by readers are more specific. We also hope that the topics raised by readers should always be of a discussion nature in principle. If they are new nouns or new terms, they can check the new term dictionary themselves. If they still don't understand after checking, they can write a letter again. Regarding the introduction of foreign language originals, we really don't have that time for the time being. We have now decided that in addition to translation issues, we can check the original works, and other inquiries will not be answered for the time being.</p>
<h3>Information This Week (1) Reading Club News</h3>
<p>Many readers have agreed to organize a reading club, and we have registered all the letters of support one by one. Naturally, it is not yet time to talk about the progress of the club's affairs. Although there are many suggestions from readers, the following two are highly valuable for everyone's reference: (A) Use social science lectures and literary lectures to unite readers who have the same interests and organize a certain science research class, but the lecturers must have real knowledge and not be dedicated to fame. (B) There is no need to hold a conference form, just hold the registration of a certain science research class. We have no preconceived notions, and the above opinions are still decided by everyone.</p>
<h3>(2) Publishing News</h3>
<p>1. The collection of Reading Questions and Answers "Volume 1 has been published on the 5th of this month. Thanks to the support of the readers, the sales department of this newspaper sold 600 copies on the 5th. The foreign letters pre-ordered in batches were also very enthusiastic. The Ministry decided to maintain the previous principle and first sell them in this city. Foreign only sends dozens of samples to places where the Museum has branches. Once sold out, it will be reprinted. However, in the first edition, due to poor printing, there are still many errors. The biggest error is that on page 162, line 6, "It is actually using Yi to control Yi" is mistaken for "Using Yi to control Yi", which is very misleading; again, the first line on page 94 is incomplete, and one word is dropped on page 95, which is also very inconvenient. Other punctuation errors are too numerous to mention. This is a very regrettable thing.</p>
<p>2. How to Self-Study Social Sciences? The upper part has been proofread twice, and the lower part is also in the first proofreading. The whole book is about 30,000 words, to be published on the 12th.</p>
<h3>(3) Shop Assistant Writer News</h3>
<p>A literary work by Wu Hesheng, a reader of the Ministry, has been introduced by the Ministry to the Monthly Literary Monthly and has been published. The publication will be released within a few days.</p>
<h3>Mailbox</h3>
<p>1. The Ministry does not receive letters and remittances for pre-ordering "Reading Questions and Answers" and self-study series.

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 原著 淸德齡公主　譯 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>On the body of this carriage, exclusively for accommodating ministers accompanying the imperial retinue, to prevent it from being confused with the carriages exclusively for railway officials, hung a plaque on both sides with the three large characters "Neiwufu" clearly written on it. The so-called Neiwufu was equivalent to the current Ministry of Interior. Apart from this Neiwufu special carriage, other carriages also had different plaques hanging, indicating who they were for or what they were carrying, to avoid everyone going to the wrong place. However, the Empress Dowager's carriage naturally could not have any plaques hanging on it, but it also had a special symbol, which was a huge dragon with bared fangs and claws painted on each side. It was painted in sky blue and matched with the golden yellow body of the carriage, which was truly very moving.</p>
<p>These ministers all thought their positions were very important, often boasting a lot in front of outsiders. But I can say with absolute certainty and responsibility that their positions were really not important at all! Although my second brother Xunling was one of them, I couldn't suppress the truth and tell lies. Speaking of my second brother's character and appearance, he was indeed very handsome, and his clothes could not be considered anything less than gorgeous and magnificent; even his knowledge, if the person who appointed him could use it properly, might not be inferior to others. But now, not only could they not make the most of his strengths, but they didn't even let him do ordinary things. Apart from his handsome appearance and gorgeous clothes, he couldn't be said to be able to do anything to serve the Empress Dowager or the court!</p>
<p>Qingshan was that Minister of the Neiwufu, who was nominally responsible for handling all government affairs related to internal affairs. His official title sounded important, but in fact, his duties were exactly the opposite of what we imagined. (28)</p>
<h3>蕪湖出孝子</h3>
<p>— 文俠</p>
<p>The people of Wuhu are truly fortunate to have produced a filial son who has shaken the heavens and the earth. From the National Government above, down to the commissioner, and then to the gentry and even prostitutes, all are praising, commending, and kneeling in worship. Now, the urine and feces of this filial son have become</p>
<p>elixir, which is truly cause for celebration!</p>
<p>The filial son comes from the village of Beixiang, fifteen li outside Wuhu, under Baima Mountain. His surname is Teng, his given name Qingyou, and he is thirty-six years old. His disheveled hair hangs down to his knees. His parents died successively in some year. It is said that the filial son sold his wife for eighty yuan to pay for the coffin and burial expenses, and put the two coffins together to build a tomb house with earth walls and a thatched roof that was less than four feet high and resembled neither a tomb nor a house. The filial son and the two coffins were squeezed inside, leaving a small square hole for people to deliver food, as the filial son's merits had not yet been completed and he still needed to eat. Another small hole in the ground led outside, serving as a place for the filial son to excrete. April 22nd was the auspicious day for the filial son's exit from the tomb. It is said that the filial son had been guarding the tomb for three years and six months. The prescribed old regulations for the success of a filial son could not be increased or decreased. The commissioner sent a representative, the gentry were there as a matter of duty, and there were tens of thousands of curious and sympathetic people. The firing of cannons, playing of music, and speeches were the same as a grand inaugural ceremony, so some people named it the Filial Son's Fame-Achieving and Inaugural Ceremony. There were also dazzling women with flower branches who burned meat incense barefoot, prostrating before the filial son, because after the filial son became famous, he was already equivalent to an earthly immortal, except that he had not ascended to heaven. Therefore, the rotten linen clothes worn by the filial son, the rice straw on the tomb house, the burnt incense ashes, and the soil where he urinated and defecated were all snatched away and dug up, saying that they could cure all diseases and even make widows have sons. The filial son himself had achieved great success, with the National Government awarding him a plaque with the words "Filial Piety Without End," a tall ancestral hall, and generous material gifts and offerings. Other officials and gentry are implementing benevolent governance, so a filial son has appeared, and the people of the county will have no disasters forever. Ah! Great filial son, who says he is not worthy of worship and praise? However, there is one point: it is still that our great Chinese national fortune is not good. It is a pity that only Wuhu has produced such a filial son. Does anyone not have parents? Will any parents never die? It is best that all those who have the qualifications to be sons become filial sons in the future. I think that after 200 million filial sons succeed, even if they all sit in meditation with their hands clasped together in the tomb houses without engaging in production, there will naturally be 200 million filial daughters-in-law to send food for us to eat, or perhaps the Japanese will send beer for us to drink?</p>
<h3>芳隣小誌</h3>
<p>— 趙鵑秋</p>
<p>My next-door neighbor is a Cantonese person. The pavilion room on their second floor is rented to a woman from Jiangdu. Her whereabouts seem quite mysterious, always going out at dusk and returning in the morning light. Whenever the sound of knocking on the door is heard, it always disturbs my peaceful dreams. My family all despise her, saying that this woman is immersed in the nightlife of the city and is probably like the "Vamp" described in Western stories. I also thought so, and out of curiosity, I planned to find out where she was at night. But after a long time, I couldn't find out anything, and I gradually forgot about it.</p>
<p>One evening, I went out with a friend and entered the XX dance hall. Across from us sat a dancer who was the girl next door. So I told my friend and went to talk to her, dancing with her. Her posture was graceful and charming. I asked her name, and it was Yu Huijuan. After a long time, I became familiar with Huijuan, and Huijuan gradually told me about her life experience, often sobbing. It was clear that she had experienced many hardships. She said, "A good man, how can I look up to him for life? A woman is like a bird in the forest before she gets married, free and unfettered. But once she gets married, she is like a phoenix in a cage. If she is lucky, she can be content with being a plaything. If she is unlucky, she will be tormented to death. I was engaged to a man surnamed Bao at the age of sixteen, and we were about to get married. But then, because of a momentary lapse of judgment, I was seduced by a handsome dandy who spread powder on his face. The dandy was fickle and abandoned me in the end, heartlessly leaving me. Having no other choice, I remarried, but my fate was ill-fated, and I had the regret of marrying the wrong person. Not long after, I divorced again and drifted around, eventually taking up dancing, which was not what I wanted, but I had no other choice." Her story is ordinary and unremarkable, but beautiful women have ill-fated lives, a sorrow that has been the same throughout the ages. In that world of bright lights and intoxicating pleasures, even amidst the extreme joy of jade-like smiles and pearl-like fragrances, there are many who shed tears in their sleeves or secretly wipe away tears when no one is watching.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Eighth: Coincidental Observation of the Stage, Foolish Passion for Picking Up a Handkerchief; Diligent Inquiries About Illness, Misunderstanding Leading to a Letter</p>
<p>Ji Zhi waved his hand slightly, saying, "It's okay. Just find some ginger and pepper, mix it with water, and drink it." Hou Zhi wrung his hands together, and other than doing this, there was no other way. So he sat in Ji Zhi's study and watched the servant bring the ginger soup. He waited for Ji Zhi to drink it, covered him heavily with the quilt, and then left. At this time, Ji Zhi realized that it wasn't lovesickness, but a bad cold. As for the reason for catching the cold, it must have been caused by going out of the warm room and catching a chill while looking at the Spring Festival couplets along the street. This had nothing to do with Yang Guizhi. At this time, his fever became even worse, and his mind was muddled. He didn't think about anything else and fell asleep. He slept for more than ten hours. When he finally woke up, the sun was high in the sky, shining on the window paper. At this time, his mind was clear, and he slowly recalled what had happened before he fell ill. Before falling asleep, he had been holding a handkerchief he had picked up, examining it under the light. He had been in a hurry to go to bed and hadn't paid attention to where he had put it, and now he couldn't remember. If he had been admiring the handkerchief under the light, he must have put it on the table and not put it away. In that case, when his brother came to the room to check on him, he would have seen the handkerchief. Not only did the handkerchief have a fragrance, but it also had embroidery, which clearly indicated that it belonged to a woman. Although it didn't have the three characters "Yang Guizhi" on it, having a woman's handkerchief in his possession was not a dignified thing. His brother and sister-in-law would inevitably be suspicious. It would be fine if they couldn't guess that it was Guizhi's handkerchief, but if they did, she was a married woman, wouldn't that make him seem like he was being improper? (379)</p>

<p>Near every school, there are always some restaurants, laundries, tobacco and paper shops, snack stalls, etc. Universities have the most, followed by middle schools. Naturally, these places only do business with students, earning all the students' money. The owners are always smiling, thinking that students' money is easy to earn and that it is easy to cheat students. At the same time, they also have the same kind of antipathy.</p>
<p>Although their facilities don't need to be too fancy, they are always crowded with customers coming in and out. The reason is nothing more than that "carelessness" is a common Chinese problem, and they are close to the "geographical advantage." If they go a step further and set up shop inside the school, they would have few customers and would have to close down. It is said that there are many reasons why students don't like to eat or buy things inside the school.</p>
<p>No credit, no customers; the old man's bitter vegetables are not tasty and have worms; the waiter deserves to be unlucky; shirts and suits are brought in, and unfortunately, these young masters discover that they are not ironed well or washed clean; the tea boy is sure to be scolded. As a rule, there is no distinction between "responsibility" and "boundaries." This is the student's</p>

<h3>追悼比王亞爾培</h3>
<p>— 寒自比京寄</p>
<p>Mourning King Albert of Belgium</p>
<p>—Han, sent from Brussels</p>
<p>King Albert of Belgium has passed away! Great is King Albert! Even as far away as East Asia, we are deeply grieved!</p>
<p>This morning, I visited Dr. Zhang Naiyan, the Chinese minister to Belgium and representative of the Chairman of the National Government of China, who attended the funeral. Here is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>My impression is particularly deep. In 1914, when the great disaster struck, I was studying in Europe. The speech of the King of your country was like lightning in a storm, illuminating the entire sky. His words were:</p>
<p>"I extend my respect to the youth who resolutely defend their country in danger with the friendship of brothers. Courage and unity are indispensable virtues for all the people of Belgium. If anyone dares to violate even an inch of our Belgian territory, all the people of Belgium will immediately obey their head, who will never break his oath...I deeply believe that a country that defends itself deserves the respect of the world. This country will never be eliminated..."</p>
<p>At that time, I was deeply moved by his words. Later, King Albert put on his military uniform and went to the front lines, living with the soldiers. The French government once invited him to go, but the King declined, wishing to defend every last inch of his territory. It was as if the King and the territory could not be separated. King Albert finally ordered a counterattack in Flanders in 1918, recovering all the lost territory.</p>
<p>At that time, I was in Europe, and what I heard was as if I was there myself. In 1919, I returned to China and wrote a complete history of the World War, which was published in Shanghai in 1923. King Albert's immortal achievements were all written in the book, so that the people of our country could admire him.</p>
<p>However, this monarch, whom I have always admired, I have never had the chance to see his elegant demeanor.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after the end of the Great War, I was appointed as our country's minister to Belgium. I had the opportunity to present my credentials a month ago and had an audience with the King. I hoped that I would have the opportunity to see him often from then on, but I never imagined that the King would suddenly pass away.</p>
<p>From now on, King Albert will leave his fragrance for thousands of years. His great deeds have added glory to mankind; his immortal memory will be shared by all mankind, not only by the people of your country, nor only by the Allied Powers of the European War, but also by the people of the Far East.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more point that should be noted. Yesterday, Mr. Fan Diwen, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of your country, recalled the King's letter, saying that the King also deeply opposed the unequal treaties that our country had suffered deeply. Therefore, our country will never forget the King's words.</p>
<p>Alas! The pain of the people of your country is deep! Last night, next to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, I personally heard the sobs of the people. I also personally saw the tears of the people. I deeply understand the sorrow of the people of your country and wish to mourn with them. A great man whose name will be remembered for thousands of years has left this world and passed away forever. Alas! (Translated from the Paris Evening News)</p>

<p>Sports News: Chinese Delegation Arrives in the Philippines Today; Consuls in the Philippines Will Welcome Them at the Port; Banquet for National Athletes Scheduled for the Evening of the 17th</p>
<p>(Telecommunications Agency, Manila, 7th) The Chinese delegation will arrive here tomorrow, the 8th. The three main countries will soon be fully assembled. Therefore, on the 11th of last month, the conference was held at 7:30 p.m. Representatives from various countries, including Hiranuma Ryosuke, Wang Zhengting, Brandt, and Vargas, each broadcast for ten minutes. Japan is also in contact to continue broadcasting.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Communication) The 10th Far Eastern Games are scheduled to be held in the Philippines in mid-May. China, Japan, the Philippines, Java, and other countries will participate. At that time, there will be a grand occasion in the Philippines. Recently, Mr. Wang Tang, the current Chinese consul in the Philippines, took advantage of his summer vacation to return to Hong Kong to handle private affairs. The reporter met him at the Golden Dragon Restaurant yesterday and talked about the recent situation of the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. According to Mr. Wang, the overseas Chinese in the Philippines are very concerned about their motherland and especially welcome our country's athletes participating in the Far Eastern Games. It is reported that our athletes are scheduled to leave Hong Kong for the Philippines on the evening of the 5th and arrive in Manila on the 8th. The Consul and Vice Consul Mo Jieen have been elected as Chinese members of the Far Eastern Games Committee. At that time, all members of the Far Eastern Games Committee will welcome them at the pier. As for the banquet, because it concerns sports issues, it should be free of national boundaries. Therefore, the Chinese Consulate in the Philippines, in conjunction with the Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, will hold a banquet for the athletes of the Far Eastern Games on the evening of the 17th of this month at the Far Eastern Club. In addition, the Japanese Consulate, in conjunction with the Japanese Imperial Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, will hold a banquet on the 20th of this month. At that time, all athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, Java, and other countries will be invited to participate in the two major banquets. It is also reported that the heads of the Chinese Consulate in the Philippines, including Consul General Kuang Guanglin, Consul Wang Tang, Vice Consul Mo Jieen, and Consul Chen Yiyuan, will likely appoint Consul Kuang as the chairman of the banquet. Consul Wang is scheduled to return to the Philippines on the same day to catch up with the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>Japanese Delegation Arrives in Manila Yesterday Morning; Landed at 8:30 AM and Stayed at LaSalle University; Japanese Residents in the Philippines Arrive to Welcome Them</p>
<p>(Telecommunications Agency, Manila, 7th) The Heiho Maru, carrying 162 representatives of the Japanese Far Eastern Games, showed its heroic posture outside Manila this morning at dawn. Representatives of the Matsuzawa River Department and overseas Chinese representatives took the customs launch to meet them outside the port, waving the Japanese flag and cheering each other. After a simple inspection and quarantine, the Heiho Maru hoisted the Japanese flag and the Far Eastern Games flag and docked at 8:00 a.m. this morning. Since last night, thousands of Japanese residents and Philippine sports officials who had been waiting without sleep held Japanese flags and gave a warm welcome at the pier. The band sent by the Philippine Sports Association played its loud music to welcome the athletes. At 8:30 a.m., the athletes disembarked from the Heiho Maru together. With the flag bestowed by Prince Chichibu as the center, they sang the military song and boarded dozens of cars, starting to march into the city, answering the cheers of the citizens of Manila along the way, and visiting the Governor's Office, the Assembly, and the City Hall to express their respect. At 11:00 a.m., they entered De La Salle University, where they stayed.</p>
<p>(Japan United Press, Manila, 7th) The Japanese delegation arrived in Manila on the Heiho Maru at 8:00 a.m. on the 7th. Officials from the Philippine Sports Association, athletes, and many Japanese residents welcomed them at the pier. The military band played music. Chinese and Japanese athletes, wearing uniforms, landed and boarded cars, led by the military band, and drove through the city. First, they visited the Assembly Hall and met with President Quezon, who delivered a speech. Then, they went to the Mayor's Office to meet with the Mayor. Then, they proceeded to the main streets of the city. The citizens enthusiastically welcomed them, shouting "Banzai" in Japanese. The group went to the Governor's Residence, got out of the cars, and attended the welcoming party of the Governor's agent. Then, they entered LaSalle University Dormitory.</p>
<p>Talk by the Japanese Chief Director (Japan United Press, Manila, 7th) The Chief Director of the Japanese athletes, Hiranuma Ryosuke, said, "Before we departed, various problems occurred, so we were quite worried about the situation in the Philippines. However, after arriving in the Philippines, we heard from Committee Member Matsuzawa that the Philippine side and the general Japanese residents expressed sympathy for the athletes, which is quite satisfying."</p>
<p>Talk by the President of the Philippine Sports Association (Japan United Press, Manila, 7th) The President of the Philippine Sports Association, Yilanang, said, "The Japanese athletes have arrived in the Philippines safely. We sincerely hope that the group will have a pleasant time here and succeed in various competitions."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the weather suddenly became hot. The air in the Youyou basketball room also became more tense. Hundreds of men and women who admired the basketball skills of Youjia and Tujin came to watch. At the beginning, Youjia took the lead with a score of 4 to 0. The other side performed brilliantly, especially Xu Wentai and Sun Huipai of Youjia, and Chen Jinzhi and Cai Yanxiong of Tujin. In the first half, the score was tied at 8 to 8 and 11 to 11. As a result, the score was 16 to 16, and neither side won. In the second half, Youjia brought in Wang Zhang, and Xu Wenkui's long shots were effective. Youjia's momentum greatly increased and led all the way, but Tujin eventually followed closely behind. Sun Huipai of Youjia was sent off for four fouls. Shen Juxun of Tujin was rude and disqualified. Qu Yuzu also continued with four fouls and was sent off. Although Tujin struggled,</p>
<p>they had already become the end of their rope, and they finally failed by a difference of three points. Youjia's championship has become the most dominant. The lineups of both sides are listed on the left:</p>

<p>After the Closing of the First Workers' Games, the Ball Games Will Continue; The Order Will Be Announced Temporarily</p>
<p>The city's first Workers' Games, organized by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, was held at the China Athletics Field on the 5th and 6th. The audience was crowded and the atmosphere was enthusiastic, which can be regarded as an unprecedented creation in the sports world. All competition events have ended, but the ball games, including football and basketball, have not yet been resolved and will continue to be held soon. The order will be announced temporarily. In addition, the table tennis performance match will also continue to be held soon.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have seen a statement by the Press Workers' Union at the end of the news about the first Workers' Games in the sports column of your newspaper, stating that "After checking the roster of our union, there are no names of Jin Toxin or Tang Wenyi. Even if there are, they may not participate without the permission of the executive committee, so as not to damage the reputation of the union, etc." I was very surprised to read this. When I registered for the competition, I never used the name of the union. Also, during the 5,000-meter walking performance, the general director of the Workers' Games asked what organization I belonged to. I immediately replied that I was participating individually. Everyone can testify. If you don't believe me, you can ask Director Xu Duo and check the registration roster of the conference. It should not be difficult to find out the truth. I think the person who compiled the name or Yongjin Special Issue made a mistake. Furthermore, the personality of athletes is regarded as their second life by sports enthusiasts. Although Wenyi is an ordinary person, he knows how to cherish himself. In any case, I would never be willing to do such a despicable thing to destroy reputation. Now, in order to clarify the truth to all sectors of society and those who care about sports, in addition to clarifying the truth to the Workers' Games and the Press Workers' Union, I especially request your newspaper to publish this letter so as to avoid misunderstandings. I would be very grateful. Sincerely, Tang Wenyi, May 7, Address: 65 Zhaojiaqiao, Hede Road</p>

<p>(Explanation) (1) Regarding the percentage of male and female students, graduates, and number of schools: males are about five times more than females. In terms of expenditure, it is nearly six times. This is far from the idea of equal educational opportunities for men and women. (2) Regarding the large number of private schools: the number of private secondary schools is only slightly less than that of county and municipal schools (registered and unregistered combined), and more than double that of provincial and municipal schools. The percentage of students in private schools is nearly equal to that of county and municipal schools (registered and unregistered combined). The importance of the role of private schools in secondary education is evident. Furthermore, unregistered private schools account for 22.73%, which is more than double that of registered schools. How to supervise and crack down on these unregistered private schools is a matter that should be given special attention in educational administration. (3) Regarding the lack of vocational education: at a time when the country is advocating vocational education, the number of vocational schools this year is far from the prescribed standard. The percentage of schools is only 9.09%, the percentage of classes is only 8.18%, the percentage of students is only 7.70%, the percentage of graduates is only 8.67%, the percentage of teachers is only 9.60%, and the percentage of staff is only 10.68%. All are only about one-tenth of the total, while the percentage of annual expenditure is 10.19%, which is three and a half times less than the 35% ratio set by the ministry. How to promote vocational schools to reach the proper proportion requires long-term efforts from the national educational administrative organs. Moreover, the percentage of vocational school students is even less than the percentage of schools and other items. Those who run vocational schools should also pay more attention to enabling vocational school students to develop. (4) Regarding the poverty of county-run schools: in this year's statistics, the percentage of county and municipal secondary schools in terms of school numbers is 49.97%, the percentage of classes is 35.34%, the percentage of students is 36.01%, and the expenditure is 22%. From the above percentages, it can be seen that although the number of county and municipal secondary schools is large, the number of classes, students, and expenditure are not proportional to the number of schools. Moreover, the annual income is more than 100,000 yuan less than the annual expenditure, resulting in such a large deficit. This phenomenon is not found in other types of schools. This is because county and municipal education funds are mainly used to run primary schools. The establishment of county and municipal middle schools is not their primary purpose. Diverting primary school funds to run secondary schools is unsustainable for most counties, except for a few wealthy ones. In the future, if the education funds of each county and city are not very sufficient, then county and municipal secondary schools can be delayed or not established. Otherwise, county and municipal secondary schools that exist in name only will not only be useless but also cause many problems.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Improving Education in Hubei Province: Report of the Ministry of Education Section Chief</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent Section Chief Wu Yan to inspect the educational situation in Hubei Province. The results of the inspection have been submitted to the Ministry of Education. The key points for improving education in Hubei Province are specifically reported below.</p>
<h3>A. Regarding Middle Schools:</h3>
<p>1.  The Wuchang Provincial Senior Middle School should be closely supervised and thoroughly reorganized. Special attention should be paid to moral education, and students should not be allowed to be lazy or negligent. 2. The increased funding for subsidized private schools should be specifically used to subsidize those that run vocational classes or vocational schools and have achieved real results. 3. The Wuchang Provincial Middle School buildings occupied by the military should be recovered as soon as possible. The girls' school is next to the wounded soldier hospital, which is easily disturbed. Negotiations should be conducted with the military authorities to relocate the wounded soldier hospital or open another school gate to separate them. 4. The regular expenses of middle schools should be distributed in accordance with Article 17 of the Middle School Regulations. Equipment expenses should account for at least 20%. This fund should be used to handle basic and essential instruments as a priority. 5. The construction and repair of provincial school buildings are best handled by a school building construction committee jointly formed by the Education Department, the Construction Department, and the Finance Department, which will comprehensively calculate and allocate funds separately. 6. The labor courses in junior middle schools are not as emphasized as in primary schools. In the future, boys' schools should focus on practical training in agriculture and industry, while girls' schools should focus on gardening, household affairs, tailoring, and other work. Old-fashioned handicrafts that are laborious and ineffective should be abolished. 7. Middle school teachers should be given training in teaching methods. This matter should be presided over by the Education Department, either by holding meetings for research, mutual visits, assigning books for compulsory study, or holding summer school lectures to ensure that they understand the principles and methods of guiding students to be automatic. 8. The junior middle school entrance examination should pay attention to setting questions within the scope of the primary school curriculum, carefully selecting excellent students, and not testing literary Chinese and the theory of arithmetic. 9. Student training should adopt strict doctrines and absolutely prohibit all bad habits, such as untidy clothes, spitting and urinating everywhere, etc. Students should also be urged to work hard and reduce school workers.</p>
<h3>B. Regarding Normal Schools:</h3>
<p>10. There is only one women's normal school in the province, in Wuchang. In the future, when education funds are sufficient, one or two women's normal schools should be added in western Hubei, northern Hubei, or eastern Hubei, or girls' classes should be added to the existing rural normal schools. 11. Each locality should add joint simple rural normal schools as appropriate to train sufficient rural elementary school teachers, but the number does not need to be too large. The location should be in outer counties far from the provincial rural normal school. 12. Within ten miles of each rural normal school, a compulsory education experiment area should be designated to guide students to serve and familiarize themselves with teaching methods in order to cultivate a spirit of serving rural education. 13. The salaries of teachers in rural normal schools in outer counties should be raised to attract excellent teachers.</p>
<h3>C. Regarding Vocational Schools:</h3>
<p>14. The Hankou City Industrial and Commercial Children's School should be reorganized into a vocational supplementary school. 15. Urge counties to jointly run junior vocational schools, and each county should run more vocational supplementary schools.</p>
<h3>D. Regarding Elementary Schools:</h3>
<p>16. The Wuchang Provincial Elementary School should be reduced in size or most of it should be transferred to the Wuchang County Education Bureau for management, and the reduced funds should be used to subsidize counties for promoting compulsory education. Otherwise, a city should be designated as a provincial compulsory education experiment area. In addition to maintaining the original schools, the number of schools should be expanded within a few years to complete compulsory education in this area. Do not allow each locality to be partial, and Wuchang should also not be able to complete the benefits of compulsory education.</p>
<p>17. At least half of the funds increased by reorganizing county education funds should be used to establish compulsory education. 18. Each county should delineate areas and implement the compulsory education emergency completion method of Baoshan County, Jiangsu, or the pre-recovery method of Huang'an, to implement the minimum level of compulsory education. 19. The equipment of public and private elementary schools is insufficient. In accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Elementary School Regulations, 15% of their regular expenses should be used for equipment expenses, and no shortage is allowed. In addition, the Education Department must raise temporary funds to gradually replenish the equipment. 20. Provincial elementary schools should use special classrooms to enroll more classes and reduce the number of out-of-school children in the vicinity. 21. The selection of textbooks should be jointly decided by the teachers of each school to form a textbook selection committee, using more precise methods, and jointly decide on the adoption of better textbooks, and the meaning of free choice should still be implied to the majority and not force the minority. 22. Elementary school teaching should uniformly use vernacular Chinese in accordance with the order. 23. The Wuhan elementary schools should first try out the organization of guidance and research separately. 24. The affiliated elementary schools of the normal schools in outer counties should lead the local elementary schools to improve local elementary school education. 25. The affiliated elementary school of the Wuchang Provincial Normal School should be improved. Otherwise, it should be closed immediately, and the normal school students can be assigned to the Wuchang Provincial elementary schools for practice.</p>
<h3>E. Regarding Provincial Educational Administration:</h3>
<p>26. The Education Department should set up a special section or committee to be in charge of the guidance and research of provincial elementary schools and the design of improving local education. 27. The teachers and staff of provincial secondary schools should be re-evaluated by the Education Department in accordance with the qualifications prescribed by the Middle School Regulations, and stricter standards should be set. The appointment of teachers and staff by the principals of each school should also be reported to the Education Department for approval before appointment. Those who have served well should be guaranteed and not be changed easily in order to break the malpractice of factions or changes with the political situation. 28. Local education in the province is too lacking in foundation. The Education Department should submit a request to the provincial government to place the educational administrators of each county and city under the direct control of the Education Department. 29. Reorganizing local education funds may not be effective within six months by sending a commissioner to each administrative supervisory area. It is recommended that the Education Department submit a request to the provincial government to form a committee with more power with the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to assist local management.</p>
<h3>F. Regarding Local Education:</h3>
<p>30. Each county should still establish an Education Bureau as a principle. Those who have abolished the bureau and changed it to a section should consider restoring it. The current directors should be carefully screened to prevent unqualified personnel from filling the position, and their salaries should also be increased. 31. The school districts of each county and city should be reduced in area to facilitate facilities. If the guidance and research system cannot be implemented immediately, one rural elementary school with convenient transportation in each district should be designated as the communication organ of the district to transmit education laws and regulations to the lower levels.</p>
<h3>Local News: A New Experiment in Mass Education: The Datong University Mass Education Experimental Zone</h3>
<p>In light of the perilous state of the nation, Datong University of this city, starting this semester, is implementing education to revitalize the nation. Furthermore, recognizing that rural revitalization is the foundation of national revival and that cultivating national strength should be premised on cultivating the strength of the people, it has established a mass education experimental zone in nearby rural areas. A concrete plan has been formulated, with teachers and students from the College of Education, the College of Liberal Arts, and the Normal School participating in a new educational experiment. The general situation of the zone is described below for the reference of those concerned with mass education and national revival.</p>
<p>A. Experimental Area: The area is located west of Fanwangdu Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, north of Datong University, including nine villages. The total land area is over 400 mu, with more than 250 households and a population of nearly 1,000. Ninety percent of the residents are farmers, and young women work in cotton mills, making a very difficult living.</p>
<p>B. Experimental Objectives: The experimental objectives in the area are twofold: first, to provide practical training for Datong University students in methods of conducting mass education and rural education; and second, to experiment with various forms of education to increase public knowledge and skills, enrich people's lives, assist local autonomy, complete the tutelage of the government, cultivate national strength, and revitalize the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>C. Staff: The zone organization uses the guidance committee as the highest authority. The guidance committee consists of five members: Tai Shuangqiu, Wu Zelin, Ma Zongrong, Xu Gongjian, and Feng Bangyan. The district has a director, concurrently held by Xu Gongjian. There is also an agricultural instructor, Luo Ciqing. As for the staff of each division, they are all students from the College of Education and the Normal School.</p>
<p>D. Educational Methods and Undertakings: The area has four educational methods: (1) Mass Education Center, located in Jijiaku, experimenting with the implementation of an off-site mass education center. Typically, mass education centers focus on work within the center. This center emphasizes off-site facilities. The completed undertakings include six mass schools, a rural library, a clinic, two demonstration farms, and a designated farm. Other undertakings such as beekeeping and chicken farming are being tested. (2) Cooperative Education Society, located in Guixiang, experimenting with the use of cooperative education to carry out mass education. The society believes that the most concerning issue for the public is livelihood, and that educational facilities starting from the national economy will be most effective. It also believes that the Chinese people are like a plate of loose sand, lacking the spirit of cooperation, leading to insufficient internal political stability and insufficient external resistance to imperialist aggression. Therefore, it provides cooperative education to train the public in the knowledge, ability, and morality of cooperation, with the aim of using cooperative methods to solve rural economic problems, and then extend cooperation from economics to rural construction and cultural undertakings. Through the path of cooperation, it cultivates the public's knowledge and ability of automatic self-government, and the public-spirited character, in order to achieve local autonomy and national revival. The completed undertakings include credit cooperation, production cooperation, and reading cooperation. (3) Rural Nian'er Society, located in Jinjiaxiang Village, experimenting with methods of promoting local products and practicing thrift to revitalize rural areas. The society advocates using the entire village as a whole educational venue, abolishing school forms and the usual class subject system. All education is embedded in economic activities. Based on the current needs of the majority of the village's residents, it has established groups for cane weaving, laundry, weaving, and planting, with one group leader selected for each group, responsible for promoting various educational activities. The village has now built a cinder road. There is also a daily wall newspaper, all created by the villagers themselves. Originally, the villagers used weaving as a side job, but since the invasion of foreign goods, no one cares about local cloth, and local machines are abandoned. Recently, after the society promoted the use of local products, all the staff members wore short local cloth outfits as role models. The public was quite moved, and more and more people changed to wearing local cloth. More than a dozen local machines have now resumed work. The local yarn and cloth produced are all sent to the Shanghai West Nian'er Society local products introduction center for sale. (4) Rural Autonomy Association, located in Xujiazhai, experimenting with methods of guiding villagers to automatically improve local undertakings. At the beginning of its establishment, representatives were publicly elected by the villagers to form an autonomy association. All undertakings are initiated by the association. The completed undertakings include a mass school, a mass tea garden, and a children's living garden. The children's living garden experiments with socialized children's education, without classrooms, desks, or chairs, but with an open-air podium and teaching materials, which are taken to various places to implement education suitable for actual life. Looking at the education represented by the above four methods, their propositions are obviously different, and the methods used are also different. Those in charge aim to experiment in many ways for comparison, and also for the sake of Datong University's research and education students' practical training, it is important to have various different undertakings to provide diverse experiences.</p>
<h3>County Social Education Organization: Appointment and Removal Procedures for Chief Personnel</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau yesterday issued instructions to the county's social education organizations, stating: "According to the order of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, it has been determined that the regulations for the appointment and removal of chief personnel of county social education organizations have been separately formulated and ordered to be followed. However, recent investigations have revealed that the county bureau has often failed to comply with the regulations when appointing or removing chief personnel of social education organizations, or has failed to obtain approval from the provincial department before allowing them to take office, or has dismissed them without approval, or has recommended replacements based on requests for resignation without forwarding them to the provincial department for approval. This situation is inconsistent with the regulations. Therefore, it is hereby declared and cautioned that henceforth, when submitting recommendations for chief personnel of social education organizations, those who have not been approved by the provincial department shall not be allowed to take office in advance. The county bureau shall not arbitrarily take action to dismiss or remove chief personnel of social education organizations who must be dismissed or removed for reasons, without submitting them to the provincial department for approval. The county bureau shall not arbitrarily recommend replacements for full-time personnel of social education organizations who resign voluntarily, without submitting them to the provincial department for approval. Chief personnel of social education organizations shall not leave their posts without approval after resigning, in order to comply with laws and regulations and emphasize their duties. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance, etc." Another order from the county government is the same as the previous one. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance. This order.</p>

<p>— Luo Ailan</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>1 PM: Went to XXXXX outline class. After class, met Mr. A, who told me it was not difficult to pass the doctoral exam. Just give more gifts to the head professor during Christmas. He cited the example of Dr. G, who enjoys great fame in China, saying that G's doctorate was exchanged for an embroidered tablecloth and two cans of tea.</p>
<p>2 PM to 5 PM: Read reference books in the department library.</p>
<p>6 PM: Ate Chinese food in the University Building restaurant. Met Shelley Huang, this person is the most vulgar, but he took a poet's name. He was carrying a large group of old maids, and a black dog, looking like he was invincible. I just sneered secretly.</p>
<p>7 PM: Returned to my apartment. Listened to a wireless broadcast, with excellent music by Rmduy Volee.</p>
<p>8 PM: R came, saying he was going to call the prostitute named R. Because he lived in the dormitory, which was inconvenient, he wanted to borrow my room for a while. I refused because I was afraid Mary would barge in, which would be inconvenient.</p>
<p>9 PM: R left. I wrote a few letters.</p>
<p>11 PM: Went to bed. Saturday Morning</p>
<p>10 AM: Woke up with a start by the telephone bell. It turned out to be N calling to ask me to play mahjong at his house at 8 PM tonight. I agreed.</p>
<p>11 AM: Went out and ate buns in the University Building restaurant. I met Shelley Huang again, what bad luck.</p>
<p>12 PM: Returned to my apartment. K came and persuaded me to join the Fei-Fei Brotherhood, saying that a certain minister and a certain celebrity in China were members, and after joining, I wouldn't have to worry about a job after returning to China. I replied that I would consider it before deciding.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>1 PM: After K left, Mary called to ask if I was free tonight. I replied that I already had a mahjong game. She asked me to go to the Tea Dance at Hotel H at 3 PM.</p>
<p>2 PM: Went to Department Store M to buy odds and ends. Met A, the girlfriend of Little C, in the cosmetics department. A is a local woman and sells perfume there. Little C is leaving and plans to abandon her. She doesn't know and still asked me how Little C has been lately. Poor thing.</p>
<p>3 PM: Waited for Mary at the entrance of Hotel H. She came about ten minutes later. We had tea and danced. There were a lot of people, and the music was also very good. I was the only Chinese person, and others were very attentive. I thought that if I hadn't come with Mary, I might not have been able to get in.</p>
<p>5 PM: Sent Mary home.</p>
<p>6 PM: Watched a movie in a small cinema.</p>
<p>8 PM: Went to N's house. His house was very messy tonight. Ever since I met N, he has been saying he wants to move, but he is still there. In addition to N and his wife, there was a local girl named V playing cards. N's wife's lung disease seems to be getting worse. Sometimes she coughed so hard that her cheeks were flushed. N didn't seem to care about her much. Such a smart and beautiful woman, but she encountered such a fate. She is more pitiful than Lin Daiyu. N is a very good person. Why doesn't he cherish her? Maybe there is another hidden reason.</p>
<p>11 PM: Eight rounds were over. V wanted to play four more rounds. V's mahjong skills were not very good. She randomly discarded tiles, but after all, she is a woman, so I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>12 AM: Finished playing mahjong. N steamed sausages and bacon for us to have as supper, and invited us to eat in Chinatown tomorrow night.</p>
<p>These two days' "Times" are copied exactly as they are. The names of the people, etc., I changed. The notebook recorded a total of four months and seventeen days. I finished reading it in one go that night. There are many more interesting records in the "Times", but unfortunately, I can't copy them all out. This "Times" is still in my possession. Therefore, I want to post a free advertisement here: if the original owner wants to retrieve it, as long as they can provide sufficient proof, I am willing to return it to its original owner.</p>
<h3>On the Liberation of Women</h3>
<p>— Di</p>
<p>According to eugenic statistics, men live to 100 years, while women live to approximately 105-106 years. In the biological world, women generally have stronger vitality, while men are more numerous, becoming a natural selection to improve the species and proliferate.</p>
<p>For many years, there have been calls for women's liberation, but the promotion of "Buddhism" is a major obstacle to the women's movement. The Hinayana sect of Buddhism hates women, probably far more than modern Westerners hate women. In the Vinaya school, looking up at a woman is a sin. 丨丨 Then let's use modern people's "logic" to extend it: since they hate it so much, there must be a hateful reason.</p>
<p>But "the Buddha said that all dharmas are neither male nor female," which shows that the Buddha's understanding of the essence of life does not distinguish between high and low based on gender. A heavenly woman transformed Shariputra into a woman, saying: "If it is not a woman but appears as a woman, all women are the same, although they appear as a woman but are not a woman." Then she transformed Shariputra back and asked: "Where is the appearance of the female body now?" Shariputra had to say: "The appearance of the female body is nowhere and everywhere." — It can be seen that hating women is not understanding the essence of life (that is, even if the essence is non-existent, it can be explained as "true form is one," or "true realm," or "original," or "itself"), and not understanding life!</p>
<p>In philosophy, the status has been fought for equally, but in reality, there is still endless liberation needed. If women do not seek liberation themselves, then men have the necessity to make them seek liberation. But isn't there a women's movement at the moment? These situations are quite different, "and should be discussed separately"!</p>
<p>Women accuse men of being unpatriotic. Why don't they go to war? The country is managed by men, and it's been messed up like this. There is a vague belief that if women were in power, they would be very patriotic. — That's not true. Men are not good at managing the country, and women are even worse. This is the psychology of those in power. — But in reality, women never want men to go to war. This is a "counterattack" thought up by the weak!</p>
<h3>Han Hai</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>"Han Hai" consists of twelve volumes, with some reference materials added by the editor after a portion of letters. It contains poems, essays, and lyrics, and it cites Mei Gong the most among the authors. Zhang Dongwen also has good works. Regarding the letters themselves, the works of the pre-Ming dynasties are dominated by Su and Huang. Liu Zongyuan's one of eight records was even pulled in to be discussed as letters, but this can only be regarded as a minor shortcoming. What I feel deeply unhappy about this book is that after purchasing it, I inadvertently discovered that there was a punctuated and annotated version in the market. Not only was the title of the book changed to "Letters of Famous People in Ancient and Modern Times," but the editor, Shen Xihou, was also squeezed out, becoming "Selected by Chen Meigong." The 2,000-word preface does not mention the original at all. Chen's preface was also deleted, and the categories were changed from twelve to four, and the order was also greatly changed. After flipping through it, I suspected that it was "Han Hai" that was bought back and proofread, and then I definitively knew that it was not another edition. After briefly flipping through the letters themselves, there were also many ridiculous mistakes. For example, in Zhonglang's letter, "two hundred years of clouds and mountains" was changed to "ten years of clouds and mountains." I really don't know how "two hundred" could be mistaken for "ten." For example, Li Junshi was changed to Sima Wengong in the annotation, a difference of hundreds of years. A lot of the book was deleted, and even within a letter, there were parts that were deleted for no reason. As for typos, incorrect punctuation, and incorrect sentence breaks, they are everywhere. Reprinting ancient books to benefit scholars is a good thing, but such reprinting will not only make the editor who put in a lot of effort not rest in peace, but also harm future scholars. From this point of view, it can be said that old bookstores' raising of book prices as antiques is very reasonable!</p>

<h3>Qingdao Cherry Blossom Festival</h3>
<p>— Zang Kejia</p>
<p>"Island nation's east wind, spring is warm,</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms redder than the sea’s western shore."</p>
<p>Qingdao has a touch of spring chill. A few days ago, a friend wrote from Jinan saying that on the train west, he had been greeted by cherry blossoms all the way, but by the time he arrived, the flowers were already fading. He said he wanted to take the train to Qingdao to catch the cherry blossom festival, to which I replied:</p>
<p>"Here, the cherry blossoms await your arrival, brother."</p>
<p>The divine power of the east wind is truly incredible; in three days, it has painted Qingdao red. If that friend were to come now, he would surely find my previous words to be near deception.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, today is race day, today is the cherry blossom festival. These three excitements combined create a red memory for the usually deserted First Park.</p>
<p>Today, people of all kinds, dressed in clothes of all kinds, carrying hearts of all kinds, are heading towards the same destination. From their clothes and their mode of transportation, one can clearly see each person's status. Automobiles, carriages, rickshaws, walking – these are the four classes. Everyone is expressing themselves to the fullest. In this flood of people, no one would abandon a car to take a leisurely stroll, and no one would fail to wear their finest attire. Who with powder wouldn't want to apply it to their face?</p>
<p>Huiquan Road, where usually one could toss a stone without hitting anyone, is today no different from Shanghai's major thoroughfares. Cars are lined up one after another, kicking up a cloud of dust. People lower their heads, enveloped in this atmosphere, barely able to see each other's faces, only hearing the sounds of car horns, carriage hooves, and rickshaw bells.</p>
<p>Cherry Blossom Road is the heart of the excitement. No one who comes to see the flowers fails to walk this road. The road runs north-south, stretching a full li (half a kilometer). Looking from one end to the other, your gaze seems to weave through the air full of people. Looking up, you see only cherry blossoms, not the sky.</p>
<p>In the midst of the excitement, one cannot perceive the wonder, because one's own eyes have already become eyes of excitement. It's best to find a quieter spot, such as sitting on the corner of a pavilion, or at a bend in the road – places that everyone passes by. There, you can have the leisure to look at each person with a cold eye. See if he is a bureaucrat, a businessman, a gentleman, a student, or a peasant who has just come from the countryside. See if she is a refined lady or a wild chicken. Each person's life story is clearly etched on their face. Observe the various postures that flash before your eyes: an old man stroking his beard, panting on the grass; an old woman supporting her stooped body with a cane; students standing tall and proud, their waists straight, with an air of looking down on everything; a beautiful woman from a deep chamber, lowering her head to conceal her shyness.</p>
<p>Small stalls have sprung up as if from the ground, one after another, each vying to display the most eye-catching foreign goods (children's toys, women's jewelry...), hanging them in the most enticing ways. The stalls are crowded with women and children, mostly from the countryside. They seem to like everything, but everything seems too expensive. Children's eyes are fixed on the various toys, using their eyes to ask their parents for something, the response often being a cold glare. However, there are also many children running in the open space, holding a light balloon. The cries of the vendors are like the frogs after a rain, making noise in people's ears and hearts. In the tea gardens, a small area is enclosed by cloth on all sides, with a few rattan chairs, and a set of tea utensils laid out on a small square table, everything is enough to make weary travelers yearn for it in their hearts. This is truly suitable for a few friends who have unexpectedly met to have a heart-to-heart talk.</p>
<p>For the sake of order, temporary police have been added, but what's the use? The ratio of newly added monitoring eyes to newly added visitors is impossible to calculate. Look, the "Keep Off the Grass" sign is just standing there, but the lawn is full of people. The words of the police have lost their authority in people's ears.</p>
<p>People seem to want to leave their youth under the flowers, so they are all vying to take photos. Look, standing up, sitting down, not knowing how to arrange their bodies, noses and eyes seeming not to be in the right place, doing it again and again, making the photographer sweat profusely. Truly, it's hard to feel at ease under the gaze of ten thousand eyes!</p>
<p>The most exciting day, the noon of this day at the peak of excitement, passed by in the hustle and bustle. The heat of the weather also subsided, and the visitors, as if having had their fill of excitement, gradually began to retreat. The cars also began to honk. A cloud of dust sends the visitors away.</p>
<p>In the evening, on Cherry Blossom Road, fallen petals cover the ground. The setting sun dyes the petals, and the cold wind awakens them from a hot dream.</p>
<h3>Rural Gleanings (5)</h3>
<p>— Fengzi</p>
<p>If it were still three hundred years ago, there probably wouldn't be such an occupation as barbering!</p>
<p>But after all, now is now. The queues of men no longer exist, and even women must cut their hair. Thus, there is the occupation of barbering. To put it elegantly, it is a service to the people, a meritorious deed.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more women in the countryside are cutting their hair, but no one has ever been able to explain the pros and cons of cutting hair. According to those who oppose it, cutting hair makes one look like a hanged ghost, a constable of the dead, or a hermaphrodite. But later they fell silent. This is probably because there are too many hanged ghosts and constables of the dead, which would affect people's lives! Even if there were too many hermaphrodites, it would seem inappropriate, so they stopped talking about it. As for those who approve, the reason is even simpler. It is said to be because the women who have returned from Shanghai have all cut their hair.</p>
<p>Here in the countryside, learning from Shanghai is undoubtedly a common trend, especially among those fashionable young men and women. But what they learn is often very ridiculous. Taking clothing as an example, the men learn the dress of hooligans, and the women learn the dress of prostitutes. Their pure nature makes them believe that this kind of clothing does not affect their personality. If anyone tells them that these are the symbols of hooligans and prostitutes, they will never believe it.</p>
<p>The fact that the clothing of hooligans and prostitutes can circulate in the countryside has its inevitable environment. To put a brand-new Western suit on a body that has just crawled out of the mud is not something that country people dare to hope for. As for the clothing of fashionable Shanghai young ladies, it often costs hundreds or thousands of gold. Country women who want to save this amount of money may have to save for a lifetime, or even a lifetime may not be enough. Moreover, fashionable young ladies are constantly changing new styles, and if they don't change styles, they are no longer fashionable. But the love of beauty is after all a common human feeling, and learning from Shanghai is already without question, so the clothing of hooligans and prostitutes is selected.</p>
<p>What is even more discouraging for patriots is that the raw materials for these clothes are all foreign goods. But this also has its inevitable environment. In recent years, the cities have resisted X goods. There is no need to talk about the places where it has not been effective; as for the effective places, it is only effective in the eight characters "Only allowed to pass through, not allowed to stay," so X goods passed through the "not allowed to stay" treaty ports and flooded into the countryside. The price is cheap, the styles are new, and there is no cry of "This is X goods," so everything passes by peacefully.</p>
<p>Who would scold country people as "cold-blooded animals"? I think: there are. And it must be in the "only allowed to pass through" treaty ports.</p>
<h3>Murmuring</h3>
<p>— Ye Cangcen</p>
<p>Yes, I can see you struggling in despair, yes, I can see you seeking life in a pool of blood. Several times, on the dark road, you rushed up and fell down again, but the sky is still without a single star. Thousands of eyes tremble towards me like fire, and hoarse cries of grief come from all around. Every turn, every step, I feel the hardship of this era. Very well, I will bear a share of the suffering of this era!</p>
<h3>Shanpu Ticket (4)</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>Of course, the first thing to do is to bring his wife and children from the countryside. He himself took a first-class train back, wearing silk, or... a Western suit? ... This would definitely give Agou's mother a big shock! (He laughed). At first she didn't believe it, but in the end I pulled out a large stack of banknotes for her to see, and she finally believed it. She wanted to ask me where I got this foreign fortune. I didn't tell her, and she got anxious. I just wouldn't tell her, saying, "What are you asking? As long as it wasn't stolen or robbed, it's fine."</p>
<p>A hawker selling olives passed by, blowing a desolate Cantonese tune on a suona horn, and then blowing "Little kids ah!" and "Buy olives ah!" from the suona in a very lifelike voice.</p>
<p>"Where did my thoughts drift to?" This kind of audacious sweet dream was the first time that Afa, who was over forty years old, had ever had. The more he thought about it, the more his heart yearned. "Haha, it's Alan's mother. She has suffered with me for most of her life. She should enjoy happiness for the rest of her life. I want to make her many silk clothes, many, many. Agou and Ajin, of course, will also have new clothes, leather shoes, and I will take them to the city to attend foreign schools..."</p>
<p>Again, a hawker selling wontons, knocking on bamboo clappers and carrying a flickering small kerosene lamp, passed by him. There was also someone carrying a pole and shouting "Wang Laoji chrysanthemum tea" who also passed by. The noise of the city had already subsided a lot. The firelight in the east had also lowered and faded, and those lying beside him had been snoring like cattle for a long time. But he still couldn't sleep. He turned over, and fantasies clung to his heart like dragonflies, clinging, refusing to let go.</p>
<p>"When I go back, I also have to buy a lot of things to give to the people in the village. That fellow Fusheng is a snobbish dog, always looking down on people. I just won't give it to him. Let him be envious! … But, but it's okay to give it to him. Let him see that I, Afa, am not a snob like him! Afu has to be given double. He usually helps me. Or I can buy dozens of acres of land in the countryside for him to cultivate. The rent is half of what others charge. This is both a favor and I am creating an industry.…" There is nothing more to think about in the countryside. The land is created, the favors are done, and the wife and children are also brought to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>"When I get to the city, the first thing to do is to build a foreign-style house. Then send my sons and daughters to school. As for myself, I can invite a few friends to my house to play mahjong. Or I can go to a very big teahouse to drink tea and listen to Jin Bi Yan singing 'Shi Lin Sacrificing at the Pagoda.' What about Agou's mother? Let her do whatever she likes, whether it's watching movies or going to big companies. Anyway, there is plenty of money. I will give her fifty yuan of pocket money every month! …"</p>

<h3>Commercial News and Finance Silver Bill Has Possibility of Passing Standard Gold Price Drops Another $19.50</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was sluggish due to news that President Roosevelt and silver advocates had indicated support for the free purchase of silver, causing market sentiment to weaken and breaking the $20 mark. Initially, overseas silver markets and both British and American markets rose uniformly. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also increased by one to two and a half li. Exchange rates fluctuated slightly, London gold rose by four pence, American cotton fell by ten pounds, and American wheat rose by 1.875 cents. Unfavorable news such as reports that President Roosevelt supported the free purchase of silver and that silver should account for 30% of currency reserves, as well as the possibility of the silver bill passing in the current Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury supporting the nationalization of silver, caused market sentiment to weaken. The market opened at around $30, but few transactions were made at this price. Market sentiment was poor, and there were many sellers, breaking the $30 mark. HSBC's listed price rose, and the domestic market became firmer and continued to decline. However, the Central Bank's efforts to release cash prevented a complete collapse. The Associated Press reported that after talks with silver advocates, they believed that a compromise silver bill would be passed in the current Congress, and that the President might agree to a silver price of fifty cents and the purchase of silver for nationalization. These unfavorable reports were retransmitted, making rises difficult and falls easy. The domestic market continued to be firm and was also affected by the gold price. Before long, it broke the $20 mark. Banks took advantage of the low price to buy. Finally, the situation stabilized slightly, and the price rose back above $20. Red gold was at $1044. Here is a summary of the market situation for the morning:</p>
<p>The market opened at $1032, down $8.50 from last Saturday. Articles opened at $2.50. The foreign exchange market opened with a near-term selling price of one shilling and three pence 125 for British currency and $32.375 for American currency. Fuxingyong and Dadecheng took advantage of the rise to list at $4.90, but few transactions were made at this price. Dadecheng, Hongli, Fuanruixing, and others jointly sold, dropping the price to $28. Huabi took over September American dollars at 93.75. Yidayong, Yicheng, and Fuchang took advantage of the rise to list at $31.70. Senchangyong, Dadecheng, Hengtai, Hongli, and Zhengchang continued to sell, and the price fell back to $27.50. Shanghai closed at 56.25 for June American dollars. Yifengyong, Yingfenghong, and Fuchang continued to buy at the low price, and the price rose back above $30. Anticipating that HSBC's listed price would rise by 125 for British currency and 375 for American currency, Dadecheng, Shengda, Fuyu, and others rushed to sell, and the price dropped to $25. Fuxingshui and Fuchang bought, and the bank also took over. Zhengjin bought September American dollars at $33, rising to $7. Daxingyong, Yuanchangyong, and Qianchangxiang tried to sell, and the price fell back to within $5. At this time, the Central Bank released cash, and Hengxing and Fuchang took advantage of the rise to list. Various spot numbers also bought, leading to much struggle. Huabi closed at 625 for June American dollars and fell from $7. Citibank closed at 5615 for this month's American dollars. Zhengchang, Hongli, Shengda, Fuxingyong, Zhifengyong, and Hengxing sold, and the price fell further to zero dollars and three cents. Dadecheng took advantage of the low price to take over, leading to much struggle. The Dalian group also bought, and the price rose back to $3.80. However, the foreign exchange market hardened, and Daxingyong, Yuqingyong, Yuanchun, and Shunmao sold, breaking the $2 mark. Qianchangxiang tried to sell, and the price fell further to $17.70. Yongde, Shenkang, and Yingfenghong took over. Maijiali took over August American dollars at 125, and the price rose back above $20. However, because Qianchangxiang's selling did not stop, the price fell back to $18.20. Maijiali and Pangen took over September American dollars at 25, and Qingfayong, Yuanmaoyong, Dingkang, Yuanchangyong, and others bought. The noon closing price rose to $1021. Articles were taken at 0.50 after the market closed. Xiexingyong and Yuanchangyong continued to buy, adding up to $2. Articles and Yuanmaoyong sold slightly, and the price fell back to within $1. Futaiheng came to take over, and the final price was above about $1. The highest price for the morning was $1034.90, and the lowest price was $1017.70, a difference of $17.20. As a result, the price fell $19.50 from last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price was $3 due to HSBC Bank's listed American exchange rate rising by 375, equivalent to a standard gold price of $1081. According to the closing price, the approximate premium was $60, $6 higher than last Saturday. The registered price for this month was $1023, and the price for June was $1021. The morning water price was $1023, and the red gold price was $1044. The situation in the roasted red gold market was stable, and the standard gold price fell. The water price was higher. 800 taels were sold by Yingfenghong to the Tianjin group at a premium of $14. The Dong goods rushed in again, totaling about 5,000 taels. The buying price among the industry was about $12 plus zero. The spot numbers bought spot goods smoothly every morning, but with too much inventory, they offered the Central Bank a price of 0.265 yuan. About 1,000 or more was handled by Yingfenghong, Dadecheng, Tongfenghong, and Dafengheng. The standard gold price fell later, and the opening price also decreased. The public bills released yesterday were 350 by Hengyu, 98 by Tongfenghong, and 84 by Dadecheng. The ones received were 259 by Qianchangxiang, 252 by Yuanyi, and 21 by Changshengyong. There were also 175 bills collected today. There are still 1,211 five-month bills left. In total, there are three long positions and seven short positions.</p>
<p>There was an oversupply in the market. In summary, Wanxing, Fuchang, Yifengyong, Fuyu, Yicheng, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, Yingfenghong, Tongfenghong, Dafengheng, Huixiang, and Shenkang were on the buying side. Daxingyong, Yuqingyong, Chengkangyong, Bingxing, Hengtai, Yongfeng, Zhaofengchang, Tongchun, Yuanchun, Senchangyong, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Yongde, Yuanchangyong, Dachangxiang, Zhifengyong, Hongli, and Ruixing were on the selling side. Yuanheng and Shunmao slightly bought after initially selling. Fuxingyong and Hengxing initially bought and then sold. The Dalian group did a total of 1,700 transactions, and not even 100 were squeezed out. Wanxing did a total of over 1,700 transactions, and over 300 were squeezed out. The Guangdong group Hengxing bought several dozen and sold over 100. Shengda sold over 100. As of today, there were 19,421 six-month chips, with a total of 45 long positions and 52 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 46,515.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market Remains Loose</h3>

According to foreign news, London six articles recently rose by 125, far increased by 1.875, US silver 125, the forward silver price rose by li, the British pound against the US dollar reduced by 375, the US dollar against the British pound reduced by 375, the US dollar against the British pound increased by 625, the British pound against the French franc fell by 10 pounds, the US dollar against the French franc increased by 25, London gold rose by four jiasi, and the private silver price rose by 1.875. The exchange rate increased by half a jiao on the ground and was reported flat. The market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of one shilling and three pence 125 for British currency and $32.375 for American currency, which was looser by 125 for British currency and firmer by 3125 for American currency compared to the closing price last Saturday. The market loosened immediately after opening. Chinese merchants tended to sell. HSBC's listed price was revealed late, with British currency increasing by 125 and American currency rising by 375, making the market even firmer. Although there was settlement, it was difficult to turn tight. The process gradually hardened. Transactions in British currency were particularly strong. Fuchang and others both took over and resold. Sassoon Central then resold. HSBC took over the settlement. At the noon closing price, the near-term selling price was one shilling and three pence 3125 for British currency and $32.6875 for American currency, which was firmer by 3125 for British currency and firmer by 625 for American currency compared to last Saturday.

<h3>The atmosphere in the banking and Qian industry is sluggish during the Spring Race period</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the Western merchants' Spring Races, although Chinese merchant banks operated as usual throughout the day, the market was still less lively due to the restriction of foreign banks closing for half a day. The foreign exchange market was six points for both early and noon markets, and the skimming was two to three points. The situation was mostly more sluggish than last week.

<h3>Securities Market in a State of Observation, with Both Bulls and Bears Present: Bond Prices Slightly Increase by Ten to Seventy Cents; May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Day Closed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained quite quiet. However, market prices struggled to rise during over-the-counter trading. Fluctuations of twenty or thirty cents occurred with every thirty to fifty thousand yuan in transactions, indicating that many were observing. Buyers had to raise prices by twenty or thirty cents to secure goods, but sellers faced the same situation. Due to a lack of buyers, prices had to be reduced by twenty cents to attract interest. Overall, the market hovered, but prices mostly trended upward. This was because large-scale selling had decreased since the 5th, while retail investor interest remained strong. Therefore, even when over-the-counter trading was slow, the limited retail trading volume still influenced market prices. Currently, most retail investors are bullish, while large investors are bearish. If the latter don't cover their positions within a week, the bulls may lose their advantage.</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening session saw a smaller "reduction-in-force" (trading volume) compared to the previous week. However, due to the gains in the 48th and 50th issues, the market turned upward, slightly reassuring anxious investors. Afterward, prices rose slightly. The current month's 20-series bonds were up by forty-five cents. In the afternoon session, earlier issues continued to perform well, rising by ten to twenty cents. However, selling in the 38th and 43rd issues caused a decline, resulting in a slight drop of ten to twenty cents. In the afternoon opening, retail investors still showed demand, and prices continued to rise by ten to thirty cents. The closing was stable and firm, with a slight hovering trend. Ultimately, market prices rose across the board, ranging from ten to seventy cents. The total turnover for both spot and futures contracts was 7.28 million yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the market announced that it would be closed on May 9th to commemorate National Humiliation Memorial Day. The price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Plummets</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung &amp; Co., the stock market experienced a selling frenzy yesterday, with declines ranging from several cents to five dollars. Specialty stocks were heavily sold off, leading to insufficient margin for speculators. It is anticipated that brokers will be very busy calling for margin over the weekend. The market opened calmly and firmly in the morning because although the House of Representatives passed the Exchange Management Act, speculators believed that this matter had already been discounted and expected the Senate to amend it. However, the market is very sensitive, and due to loosening supply, prices plummeted when speculators sought to offload their holdings. Silver remained firm due to President Roosevelt's visit to New York for the funeral of former Treasury Secretary Woodin, where Senate silver advocates met with Roosevelt in his car.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to agent reports: (Securities) After the sharp decline in specialty stocks, the market is oversupplied, but pressure gradually eased at the close. (Wheat) There has been no rain recently, resulting in weak buying interest. The spot position is quite complex, but production conditions have not changed, so it is suitable for purchase. (Cotton) Sentiment regarding yarn is improving, and the government is adopting a more conservative approach to general commerce, which may be beneficial in the long term. However, the market lacks momentum and currently has no clear trend. (Rubber) The market is very firm, and spot traders are easily absorbing ongoing bullish liquidations. (Silver) The announcement was too late to impact the market. Senator King predicts that the current Congress will enact silver legislation. After holding a preliminary meeting with the President, meetings will continue next Monday. Half-day turnover was 870,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>|                    | May 4th | May 5th | Change  |</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Purchases of Cotton Yarn and Coarse Yarn in North China</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon. However, actual demand remains strong. Purchases of 16-count coarse yarn in North China are quite active, further bolstering sentiment. New selling pressure has been temporarily halted, and the cotton price increase is even more significant, further stabilizing the yarn market. However, older stock is being sold off in the near term, impacting upward momentum. The future will depend on current yarn sales.</p>
<h3>Standard Yarn Market: Morning Low, Afternoon Rebound</h3>
<p>The standard yarn market opened lower in the morning due to a lack of buyers and bullish liquidations, causing the market to loosen slightly. Prices for all months fell by five, six, seven, or eight cents. In the afternoon, the market rebounded due to rising cotton prices, with prices for all months rising by two, four, five, or six cents. Total turnover for the day was 24,550 bales. Sales included 1,300 bales from Yu Da, 950 bales from Jin Chang, 550 bales from De Ji, 450 bales from Chang Ji, 450 bales from Heng De, 650 bales from Yi Cheng, 400 bales from Chang Feng, and 350 bales from Tong Ji.

<p>|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|</p>

<h3>Weak Spot Sales of 1,000 Bales</h3>

<p>Shantou: 65 bales; Yunnan: 240 bales; Inland: 160 bales; Fellow Traders: 12 bales;</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 250 bales; Zhenjiang: 15 bales;</p>
<p>Tianjin: 790 bales; Nanjing: 1 bale.</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton: Prices Rise by Twenty-Five Cents</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rose, maintaining a firm position. Although American cotton fell, Indian cotton rose, and rumors of Japanese purchases and a potential short squeeze circulated, causing the market to tighten further. However, recent yarn sales to Japan have been significant, which should lead to a demand for raw materials, making it difficult for market prices to fall.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Cotton Market is Firm and Buoyant</h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened lower in the morning due to the fall in American cotton and the drop in the gold market, with a lack of buyers causing prices to fall by fifteen to thirty cents for all months. In the afternoon, the market suddenly turned upward due to reports of foreign merchant purchases, with prices rising by two, four, or five cents for all months. Total turnover for the day was 121,100 dan.</p>
<p>Sales included 3,100 dan from Chun Ji, 4,800 dan from Yuan De, 9,600 dan from Tong Ji, 1,200 dan from Da Feng, 1,800 dan from Yuan Da, 2,200 dan from Heng De, 7,000 dan from Shen Ji, 2,400 dan from Chang Feng, and 1,700 dan from Yuan Xing Chang.</p>
<p>Purchases included 4,700 dan from Chang He, 3,700 dan from Xie Sheng, 2,400 dan from Ren Feng, 1,400 dan from Tong Fu, 2,200 dan from Ji Feng, 2,400 dan from Geng Feng, 1,600 dan from Xin Heng, 4,100 dan from Sen Kang, and 1,600 dan from Shen Chang.</p>
<p>The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>|          | High   | Low    | Close  | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|</p>

<h3>Active Consumption of Raw Cotton by Factories</h3>
<p>There is still active consumption of raw cotton by factories. The sources of supply include 736 bales of Tong cotton. The current cotton compensation prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Ling Hua: 50.50/53.50; Yong An Factory purchased 1,200 pieces of spot goods for factory delivery.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton: 58.90; Shanghai Factory purchased 1,000 bales of spot goods for factory delivery.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Xihe Cotton Market is Flat</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: The cotton market in Xihe, Tianjin, remains flat. Foreign merchants still do not have a clear trend. 280 bales were purchased at a price of 40.06 yuan, and another 80 bales were purchased at a price of 40.07 yuan. American cotton from the Shen group in Xihe has good demand, and good quality goods remain firm. Yu Ji Company purchased 130 bales at a price of 41.5 yuan, and another 50 bales at a price of 39.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the market price was depressed due to the weakness of American cotton, large-scale liquidation by bulls, and selling by Japanese merchants. Afterwards, it returned to high levels due to short covering and large-scale purchases by speculative investors. When new cotton came on the market, the difference between new and old cotton was 8 rupees. Later, because multiple parties continuously purchased old cotton, the difference was only 1 rupee. At present, the market situation is completely dependent on foreign conditions, but the lack of inventory is the main reason. Yarn factories are still on strike, and the situation has improved slightly. There are not many purchases from Europe and China, but Japan has made quite a few purchases. The statistics for the previous week are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>|                        | 1933  | 1934  |</p>
<p>|------------------------|-------|-------|</p>
<p>| Cumulative Receipts since September 1st | 1,946 | 1,870 |</p>
<p>| Weekend Inventory       | 966   | 1,208 |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Exports since September 1st | 1,096 | 855   |</p>
<p>| Exports to Europe       | 261   | 301   |</p>
<p>| Exports to China        | 62    | 23    |</p>
<p>| Exports to Japan        | 761   | 418   |</p>
<p>| Exports to Other Regions | 12    | 13    |</p>
<h3>Food: Bearish Trend Hits Wheat Futures Hard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market experienced a uniform and sharp decline in all months after the opening in both the morning and afternoon. Although quotations for foreign wheat rose by about 4, 5, or 6 cents in Chicago and 1 or 2 cents in Canada, the market was somewhat stable after the opening. However, the sentiment of the entire flour milling industry has become extremely weak. The manufacturers' request to the government for support is neither possible nor permissible given the circumstances. Therefore, many bullish customers have withdrawn their positions, and small factories are also selling off, with prices falling by as much as 2 cents compared to the previous week.</p>
<p>The sharp bearish trend struck again after the afternoon opening, as rumors spread that major factories were aware of the dim future and were increasingly burdened. The talk of support has also become a thing of the past, so they are gradually selling off at a loss, with no price limits on near- and far-term contracts. Therefore, market sentiment became extremely weak, and the selling pressure was overwhelming, with the extent of the decline exceeding expectations. Contracts from the current month to August have all broken the 9.5-cent barrier, and some have even fallen by 4 cents. The reason for this bearish trend is still sluggish real sales and oversupply. As a result, the current month plummeted by 7 cents, June and July fell by 7.25 cents, July also fell by 5.5 cents, and September and October fell by 5.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Sharply by Six to Seven Cents; Foreign Wheat Market Improves... Weather Improves; Flour Sales Sluggish... Spot Goods Flood the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market experienced a uniform decline in all months after the opening in both the morning and afternoon. Because quotations for foreign wheat rebounded by 1 or 2 cents and 4, 5, or 6 cents, market sentiment was somewhat stable after the opening. With favorable weather, the milling industry's sentiment has softened, and opening prices have fallen slightly by 2 or 3 cents. After the afternoon opening, the bearish trend in the flour market naturally boosted selling pressure in the wheat market. Fortunately, inland traders did not sell off heavily, otherwise a sharp decline would have been unavoidable. As a result, the current month fell by 7 cents, July fell by 6 cents, and August fell by 5 cents. There is still no activity in the spot wheat market. Although there is abundant supply on the market, factories are unified in their caution due to the畅到大量 arriving of foreign wheat and the lack of improvement in flour sales.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that yesterday, grain merchants distributed more than 40,000 bags of spot wheat to various factories, with prices divided into three grades: a maximum of 3 yuan and then 2.85 yuan, which is a decrease of 0.5 or 0.6 yuan compared to the previous month.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Turns Steady</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source boats from various groups that poured in totaled more than 60 (more than 9,000 stones), among which late rice was still abundant, while thick japonica and various colors were less. The buying interest of guest groups in late rice recovered smoothly, and the northern and southern foreign groups continued to purchase 3,000 bags of Qingjiao Songsi Xilian and other goods. However, due to the continued abundance of sources, supply exceeded demand, and there was no sign of improvement. The trend was a hidden soft one, and there was a risk of downward movement in the market tomorrow. Although the store inventory of thick japonica seemed to be in a tight supply, the guests all set their purchase levels based on the amount of goods arriving. There was a steady trend in japonica from Changbang Nangang and other japonica. The sales of Duyang pointed rice and other japonica varieties were similar, and there was no rise or fall. The dark change of the destination to the Yuan rice has broadened the sales channel, and the market color is tighter.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 33 to 34 boats arrived from various places in Hexia inland. The sales of various colors in the market, the morning market was average, and the white japonica white yuan sheep tip were very popular in the afternoon market. The Du pointed, wharf pointed, guest pointed early rice and thin rice were slightly changed, the Yin Yuan arrival and sales were both smooth, the price, white japonica was tired and went to three or five points in the early market, the later market was settled, the white yuan price was tight, and the sheep tip price was plus five points. Du pointed was tired and short three or five points, the wharf pointed guest tip was settled, early rice and thin rice high goods were firm, medium and sub price was small number of points, and the Yin Yuan was slightly tighter.</p>
<h3>Rough Foreign Rice Rises Again by Ten Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of guest rice was slightly more, and the market seemed to be able to stabilize slightly. However, Fuzhou's yesterday market was active again, and the local mainland Zhejiang gang all had inquiries, so the high-priced goods in the market still saw step building, and the middle and sub price was flat. A total of 3,949 bags of various indica rice were opened throughout the day, and the local mainland gang sold less than 1,000 bags in total, and the rest were handled by Fuzhou. The local street continued to run the foreign rice business. Yesterday, the mainland gang suddenly paid attention to Siamese rough foreign rice, and then competed with the local street to run the business. The initial price in the morning was 5.45 yuan, which has increased by 5 points, and then it was rebought by the mainland local street, and a total of 1,500 bags were opened, and the price also increased to 5.55 yuan, which is another dime than last week. The small twisted was opened at 500 bags, and the price was 7.42 yuan, which is also 7 cents.</p>
<h3>New Rapeseed Opens at 3.9 Taels</h3>
<p>丨Red Grain Goods are Short, and the Market Rises丨</p>
<p>The transaction of new rapeseed is earlier than last year. The merchant had already opened a thousand bags of Pinghu goods the day before yesterday, and the price was 3.9 taels, which was in accordance with the foreign firm's regulations, stating that the goods would be delivered in June and July "Last year's opening was 5 taels, and the goods were delivered in July." There are still few sellers, and the market is looking good. At the moment, the annual harvest cannot be predicted. If the weather is clear and correct, it will be a good harvest, and the market may be unstable. The red grain has been in short supply recently due to scarce sources and lack of accumulation, resulting in tight market conditions. Yesterday, Niuzhuang red shelled grain had opened at 2.28 yuan, and two cars had been traded, and the mainland wine workshop still took them.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Chaoqing is Gradually Becoming Active</h3>
<p>Middle and lower grades rise by 1 cent... More than 1,000 bags were traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, because the sugar market's customs duties slightly declined in the afternoon, the trend suddenly became weak. The association's price for four coarse sand whites was 21.1 yuan, down 1 cent, but still lacked buyers. Although Taikoo Sugar's B mark and this factory's No. 1 white called for the original price, they did not succeed. The domestic Chaoqing market gradually became active yesterday, and the middle and lower grades rose by 1 cent. It is estimated that more than 1,000 bags were opened, with Tizhuang Qing at 11.8 yuan, the next grade at 11.6 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 11.5 yuan to 11.45 yuan, ordinary Jieyang Qing at 11.1 yuan to 11 yuan, and Longgang Qing at 10.6 yuan to 10.55 yuan. In addition, more than 160 large pieces of Pian Qing were opened, and the price was 8.7 yuan, and the market situation was normal.</p>
<h3>Longkou Noodles from Zhabei Again See Low Prices</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli and dried noodles, previously opened at 16 yuan due to few sales. However, the sales channels have not been smooth recently, which has caused the market to continue to show a soft image. It has been found that more than a thousand pieces arrived earlier, and only a limited number were sold. There is also no continued opening of guest goods, indicating that the exhaustion is not settled. Yesterday, the Changjiang gang made a few purchases, selling 92-standard skins at a price of 15.4 yuan, and the next one was slightly reduced.</p>
<h3>Summer Woolen Cloth and Broadcloth in the Textile Market Show a Slight Decline in Volume</h3>
<p>Woolen cloth and broadcloth have been weak recently, and the prices of goods have mostly fallen and risen less. The sales force has suddenly decreased compared to ten days ago. The association's wholesale transactions are very cold. Only white straight tribute cloth, white poplin wool yarn cloth, all-weather hemp rubber cloth, etc. for summer sales, each party has some trading embellishment, but most of them are zero-piece business.</p>
<h3>Hardware Blue Lead Opens a New High Price</h3>
<p>Since the exchange rate has tended to fall, the hardware market has seen an increase, but there are several colors that have returned to slack because of the lack of actual delivery. However, the sales of blue lead continued to fly high, and yesterday's market valuation showed a new high price. It is estimated that each dan is 17 yuan, which is 5 cents better than the previous day. However, the industry holders of existing goods are still unwilling to easily leave them, and there is a possibility of continued improvement.</p>
<h3>Pure Antimony 400 Yuan has been Opened</h3>
<p>Since pure antimony has risen to 400 yuan (per ton), foreign banks have maintained a bystander attitude, and the actual delivery has decreased instead. Yesterday, because the American merchants were in urgent need of goods, the market price of 400 yuan has been bought in, and it is heard that more than 20 tons have been traded. It is found that there are not many goods from Hankou, and the market atmosphere is very good.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Wuyuan Maofeng Tea will be Newly Released</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Maofeng is made from tea buds and silver buds picked before the beginning of summer. The leaves are faintly hairy, and the tea buds are like mountain peaks, hence the name. The juice of the whole branch of tea is all contained in the pointed buds, and the taste and fragrance are thicker than other teas. In the past, wealthy tea farmers in Yibei picked this tea for their own drinking pleasure, and for the needs of giving gifts to friends and enjoying guests, not for sale. In recent years, because people from far and near who have tasted this tea have entrusted people to search for and purchase it, and they are not stingy with the price, so the name of Maofeng has become known at home and abroad. Mountain households are willing to earn more money, and in addition to picking and making tea for their own consumption, they also respond to the needs of various parties. This year, due to the cold weather, the tea trees were slow to show their peaks. Fortunately, the weather has warmed up recently, and the tea buds are gradually growing longer. Mountain households in Yibei Yanchuan and other places are planning to pick them within the day, and there will be a large number of new releases next week.</p>
<h3>Local New Tea Continues to be Launched</h3>
<p>Since the new Wenzhou black tea was launched last week, yesterday the local Zhenmei new tea was also produced by Tongyifeng Tea Factory, taking Xiaoshan Gaozhuang goods and making 15 boxes, and Yilong Tea Branch released new samples. Although the storekeepers have been talking about prices, most of them are in a negative attitude due to the poor tea news abroad. As a result, the new discs of Wenzhou black tea and local Zhenmei green tea were not opened, and the future of the tea market is difficult to consider optimistic.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Turns to Rise</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the new Qimen black tea, due to the cold weather and the length of time, the output is not enough to meet the needs, resulting in the price of all kinds of mao tea rising. Ordinary goods have been raised from more than 70 yuan to 90 yuan, and the average tear price is 20 yuan higher than last year. Shanghai merchants, after receiving news from Qizhuang, were anxious.</p>

<h3>4.8 Million Square Miles of Lost Territory</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, our country's land has been carved up by Country A one moment and dug up by Country B the next. Until now, we still haven't figured out how much we've actually lost. Fortunately, there are foreigners who have helped us calculate it clearly. We might as well list it below to let the landlords see how the profits and losses are:</p>
<p>Mr. Pierson, a Far East affairs expert at the American Foreign Policy Association, declared in his official report today, "If China's territory continues to be invaded, it will be reduced to a small country and dominated by Japan." Pierson's report continued, "Japan's recent occupation of Manchuria and Rehe is equivalent to the 2.4 million square miles lost by China in the ninety years since the British annexed Hong Kong in 1842." (National Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>This list is very concise. Although it doesn't give a total, we can calculate that our country has lost a total of 4.8 million square miles of land in the past ninety years. Because we lost 2.4 million square miles before, and Japan has invaded an area equal to that amount in the past two years, the total is 4.8 million square miles. Previously, the territories lost by our country were Hong Kong, Annam, Burma, Taiwan, and Korea. Among them, the British took Hong Kong and Burma, the French seized Annam, and Taiwan and Korea were also seized by Japan. In this way, the land plundered by Japan accounts for about two-thirds of the total land lost by our country.</p>
<p>Our country has always boasted to the world that it has a vast land and a large population. Since its doors were smashed open by foreigners, it has continued to lose cities and territories, resulting in shrinking territory and declining population. Now that the North China crisis has not been resolved, a state of turmoil has suddenly appeared in South China. As for Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet, located on the borders and surrounded by great powers, with hidden dangers and lurking troubles, they cannot rest easy either. Therefore, if our country does not become strong one day, it will be difficult to consolidate its territory one day. If it continues to be invaded, not only will it be reduced to a small country as Mr. Pierson said, but it will even have more than enough to perish.</p>
<h3>A Soliloquy on Life</h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>Friend:</p>
<p>A traveler walking alone in the wilderness of night would be happy to use his own bloodstains as sparks, wouldn't he?</p>
<p>These days, many scholars are writing inspirational articles for young people, teaching them how to endure, how to strive, and how to struggle. However, if the journey of life is dark, what use is a map to a lonely traveler before he finds light?</p>
<p>I have never liked reading books on inspirational philosophy, nor have I ever wanted to teach others to read them. From real-life experiences, I feel that inspirational words, whether the author or narrator is sincere or not, are ultimately irresponsible in their original meaning. Moreover, under objective conditions, like all decorations, they are built on the upper layers of society.</p>
<p>If encouragement can excite people, then shouldn't the reaction of all stimulants be anesthesia?</p>
<p>Life's experiences cannot be taught with mere words. To gain them, one must experience them. And the meaning of life can only be interpreted by those who have experienced it, according to their surrounding material environment.</p>
<p>Walking on the road of life, I may remember a little of the process, though it is short. However, in constant grinding and progress, I may see two or three travelers standing at the crossroads of side roads, hesitating, pondering, waiting for something. Painful tears may wet one or two grains of sand, but they have never watered any small grass, nor have they ever submerged my own heart.</p>
<p>When I first encountered a fork in the road, didn't I also feel a lot of hesitation? But watching the travelers brushing past, walking far away without looking back, I felt so proud, so angry.</p>
<p>It was at the moment of this spark that I learned the method of choice in the wilderness of life.</p>
<p>The world is forever contradictory and conflicting. All things display their beauty and ugliness. Everything makes people nostalgic and disgusted. However, the changes and evolutions of nature all follow the same rhythm, just as there is no substance that completely disgusts people, and similarly, there is nothing in the world that completely captivates people. If love is absolutely beautiful, then why do people not have a decisive direction when love conflicts with social systems? Conversely, death should be terrible, right? But in a certain sense, it may be lovely.</p>
<p>Love and material possessions, hardship and pleasure, success and failure, survival and death, are forever opposed on this road of life. And in the sparks of this opposition, you and I are burned and forged.</p>
<p>I don't want myself to be melted by the white-hot flames, nor do I want you to be destroyed by the fire. When everything is in conflict, it should be the time for us to choose.</p>
<p>In all the opposition, do you want to take care of both sides? That will not happen. For example, in the struggle for love, you also want to take care of the compromise with the social system. You seem to think you are very smart, right? You say you have learned the method of trickery. But haven't you been feeling depressed lately?</p>
<p>Based on this fact that you have experienced, I want to tell you: "The highest form of life lies in choice, not in trickery. There is no such thing as taking care of both sides in the world. At the fork in the road where the two are opposed, you should decisively choose one."</p>
<p>But don't ever forget the meaning of that choice.</p>
<p>Don't overthink, and don't hesitate. Choose the direction with greater meaning in life. In the boundless darkness, I extend my hand to you and me with caution.</p>
<h3>A Person in the Tiger's Mouth</h3>
<p>— Wen Hei</p>
<p>(One of the Impressions on the Road)</p>
<p>Taking the tram, the driver often stops the car suddenly, causing my heart to pound, and at the same time, a feeling emerges in my mind! Someone must be crossing the road. Today, because there were many people on the car, I was standing on the front platform, and a terrifying and tense scene on the screen gave me a deep and unforgettable impression.</p>
<p>The tram sped down from Baxianqiao towards Dazimingzhong with a jingling and creaking sound. At the intersection of Xixinqiao, the traffic light showed a green light, and the driver's foot hit the bell below urgently and loudly. Suddenly, a person on the right hurriedly crossed the road. When he reached the tram tracks, the tram happened to rush to his side. I subconsciously felt the danger of that person and couldn't help shouting, "Ah!" The driver, with quick eyes, also immediately stopped the car and shouted, "Pig!" This was already enough to make my heart beat wildly. Unexpectedly, the person crossing the road had just passed the front of the tram, and a black-plated car flew from the back on the left! The car immediately stopped with a miserable cry, just like a pig going to the slaughterhouse. Someone on the sidewalk let out a voice of concern and surprise, "Oh dear!" I saw that the fat red face of the person crossing the road turned pale green. Knowing that he had violated the rules and knowing that he had escaped danger, he lowered his head without a</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>sound and quickened his pace to walk onto the sidewalk, and the sweat on his forehead was already dripping down. The person was wearing a coffee-colored spring silk robe. This impression was engraved in my mind, and now when I think of it, his shadow immediately appears before my eyes.</p>
<p>The road is like a tiger's mouth, and that person was just a person in the tiger's mouth!</p>
<h3>On Marriage</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ding</p>
<p>It is said that a man should marry when he is old enough, and a woman should marry when she is old enough. This is why marriage is valued. Why is marriage necessary? Because it is for raising sons. Mencius said, "There are three unfilial acts, and having no descendants is the greatest."</p>
<p>, The sage has already clearly instructed us, so raising sons is inherently correct and proper.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are heaven and earth before there are all things, and then there are men and women, the so-called "two five unite essence, all things are born one,結"</p>
<p>Marriage is originally based on this; and looking around at today's advocates of nationalism, many especially take promoting population growth as their ability, , Then it is very clear that marriage is no trivial matter,</p>
<p>The union of men and women is a joyful state of life; but it is also a troublesome matter! First, there is the word of the matchmaker, then there must be the order of the parents; and demanding betrothal gifts and fighting over dowries almost exhausts the tongue; consulting the birth years and choosing auspicious days involves repeated labor; the woman's house must be decorated, and the man's family must be more splendid, and foreign coins and banknotes are countless! When the tedious customs and rituals are over, they are sent into the bridal chamber in pairs, and lie on the same bed together. Then the joy of tonight will be beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ceremony of marriage, there are old and new methods. In old-fashioned marriages, there are many tedious customs and detailed rituals; regardless of the size of the mansion, it must be decorated with lanterns and colorful hangings, and the furnishings must be splendid; regardless of whether relatives are close or distant, they must all wear red and green, competing for beauty; the groom wears a long robe and mandarin jacket, and the bride wears a phoenix coronet and embroidered cape; first, they pay homage to heaven and earth, kneeling and bowing, exhausting their four legs; then, they eat and make merry in the bridal chamber, with frivolous words and laughter, worrying both hearts, the so-called "good things are often beset with difficulties"!</p>
<p>As for new-style marriages, also known as "civilized marriages," they are not the Zhou rituals of national essence, but the foreign system of the West; their ceremonies mostly take place in churches; there are few dazzling lanterns and colorful hangings, and few ear-piercing blows and beats; the arrangement is simple, with only a few fresh flowers; the groom wears a suit and leather shoes, and the bride wears a cheongsam and veil; the pastor officiates the wedding and must also pray for blessings; the bridesmaids support them, happy to look at them from the side; when the ceremony is over, although there must be a request to "report the love story," there is after all no embarrassment of the old-fashioned bridal chamber!</p>
<p>As for those who marry after raising children, it is like a store's "trading first, then choosing an auspicious day to open"; although it goes against etiquette, it does not harm filial piety and cannot be overly criticized!</p>
<h3>Corpse Examination</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Men, women, old, young, in groups, like a tide rolling into the narrow alley. In an instant, the slender XX alley was crowded to the brim, with no room for water to leak; but those who came later were still trying to squeeze into the cracks.</p>
<p>The confused sounds could not be heard clearly. "The death is really terrible! The face is full of blood, the tongue is dragged out three or four inches long; and the eyes are protruding too!" A man in blue overalls squeezed out from the bottom of the alley and reported to the crowd who were stuck halfway in the alley and could not get in.</p>
<p>So, the various discussions began again; "Why did he die so terribly?"</p>
<p>It is said that he hanged himself. Hanged ghosts are so… People, haven't you seen the hanged ghosts in the hanging opera?"</p>
<p>The crowd in the alley retreated to both sides, leaving a small path in the middle.</p>
<p>Two policemen in uniform, holding thick rattan canes, charged straight in with great fanfare. Behind them followed a small sedan chair, and behind them followed four yamen runners, all going into a low, dilapidated bungalow at the bottom of the alley.</p>
<p>"Ah! This is Master Wang from the county, he came specially to examine the corpse." A man with a short mustache told them triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Why report to the officials? Alas! It's really pitiful. A ghost whose corpse has been examined by officials will never be able to be reincarnated." An old woman in her fifties said to her companion.</p>
<p>"That's right, the coffin will also have to be sealed."</p>
<p>The chaotic sound suddenly fell silent: the crowd in the alley retreated to both sides again; two policemen escorted a young man in a Western suit and an old woman out of the alley, followed by the small sedan chair and the yamen runners, all leaving.</p>
<p>"Lao Huang, do you recognize him? The young man escorted by the police is A Shun! He has been in Shanghai for years and actually became a compradore in a foreign firm, making a fortune!"</p>
<p>"Is it him? That's Zhang Ma's son. Why did the county magistrate arrest them all?" "It is said that A Shun's wife's reputation outside is not good, so he specially rushed back from Shanghai yesterday. At night, he severely beat his wife and forced her to sign a divorce agreement. Who knew she would seek death in the middle of the night!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Is there also a crime for beating one's wife? He didn't beat her to death, is it worth arresting them to the county? Lao Huang was saying loudly; a big fat man next to him interrupted;</p>
<p>"You don't know, A Shun has been a compradore for several years, riding in cars and living in foreign houses in Shanghai, and he has also taken two concubines. Now, because he has hooked up with a beautiful female student, he is preparing to get married next month; so he is trying to find a way to divorce the homely old wife first, so as to avoid future entanglements. Which one of us in the alley doesn't know how virtuous A Shun's wife is?"</p>
<p>Everyone was still discussing in groups. The crowd, like a tide, slowly rolled out of the alley, and the desolate XX alley was more desolate than before.</p>
<p>"Equality between men and women is just a deceptive slogan! Otherwise, how could the morbid state of feudal times still exist in the 20th century?" I thought to myself all the way.</p>
<h3>Killing the Family While Fishing</h3>

<p>Hua Fengchun dropped his knife and escaped from Ding's house; the neighbors all stood by and watched, pretending not to know about it and avoiding the matter.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Generally Unqualified Women Entering School</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Reading Miss Zheng Xiaocang's translation of *Little Women* has raised a question. I am writing to ask for your guidance. This book depicts the deep feelings of family affection and the sincerity of friendship, which truly makes people feel more affection for their families. In particular, Mrs. March's deep love for her daughters reminded me of my deceased mother and aroused infinite sadness.</p>
<p>The question is this: In the book, "Little Women Meg and Shu, are listening to their mother's instructions: 'Spiritual happiness is truly stronger than being an unhappy wife or a woman who runs around chasing a future husband without following the Dao.'" Mrs. March affirmed: "Don't worry, Meg, poverty rarely deters sincere lovers." ······</p>
<p>Yes, it is better to remain single than to have an unsatisfactory lover, and with such virtuous parents, they can live a happy life even if they do not marry. And in the book, Meg eventually gets engaged to Brook, and Shu and Laurie are also very likely to become a family. (I have not yet read the sequel *Good Wives*.) But in China, poverty does indeed deter lovers. How will generally unqualified women who cannot enter school solve their marriage problems? Leave it to the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words? I am afraid that there will be no good results; remain unmarried for life, but lack the ability to be self-reliant and a good environment; find a suitable lover themselves? Not only is there no opportunity, but even if they find one, stubborn families and cannibalistic social ethics cannot be passed. Wise sir, please tell them how they should solve this difficult problem!</p>
<p>Reader Lanfang</p>
<p>Answer: Ms. Lanfang raised two questions, one is whether poverty can deter lovers, and the other is "How will generally unqualified women who cannot enter school solve their marriage problems?" These two questions seem very ordinary, but they are extremely common, and in fact, they do make "generally unqualified women who cannot enter school" feel depressed. Therefore, the editor specially raises it for discussion and hopes that everyone will express their opinions on this kind of problem so that these problems can get a more satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the question of "Can poverty deter sincere lovers?" Your understanding of this is very correct. Indeed, Meg and Shu in the book "Little Women" can live a very happy life even if they do not marry. In other words, they are not really pitiably poor. Therefore, the so-called poverty that cannot deter lovers is only the author's hope. Generally speaking, poverty has a great influence on love. In our society, a group of stubborn families are very enthusiastic about the disputes over dowries, dowries, and other issues, which is enough to show the relationship between property and marriage. Moreover, recently, because of the difficulty of life, many people who rely on salaries to live not only their parents pay attention to property, but they themselves also deeply feel the difficulty of maintaining a family and the burden of wives and children. Therefore, now people generally hope that women can be self-reliant and not completely require their husbands to bear the economic burden. As for those who have enough money to support their wives, they often regard women as playthings. Therefore, no matter which aspect we talk about, women should always seek economic independence. It is a small matter if sincere love is cracked due to economic relations. If they have to rely on their husbands to support them and are bullied, abused, or even abandoned by their husbands, then the problem will be troublesome and difficult to solve completely.</p>
<p>Second, how can generally unqualified women who cannot enter school solve marriage? This is indeed a big problem for them. Because of this reason, I don't know how many women's youth have been betrayed, and they finally have to adhere to the idea of ​​celibacy and never marry. But is celibacy right after all? Of course, those who agree have their own reasons, but courtship is a normal human development. Since this fact is undeniable, we naturally have no reason to agree with celibacy. Even for those women who cannot marry due to the oppression of the social environment, we dare not persuade them to embrace celibacy, but want them to lower their standards and solve the marriage problem. Therefore, the second question you raised can be put aside, and now we will discuss how women in old-fashioned families can solve marriage and make marriage relatively happy without problems.</p>
<p>It is indeed very difficult for women in old families to find lovers, which you already know very well. But marriages arranged by parents "may not have good results," which is probably just your guess. Affected by the new trend of thought, you don't seem to have experienced it yourself. But the editor has seen and heard more about this kind of problem. Almost nine out of ten of the letters I replied to in this mailbox are this type of problem, so I think your guess is not an overestimation, and in fact, there should be this concern. But since freely choosing a lover is so difficult, and letting the family seek for you is a risky nature, is there no way to go? That is not true. I think it is not unreasonable for the family to introduce and the decision to be made by yourself. Because this is feasible in the old family and is not necessarily completely blind marriage. Recently, most semi-old families have adopted this method, and there seems to be no abuse. Because we certainly won't love one when we see one so indiscriminately, but it's not that we only feel that one person is lovable for the rest of our lives, and we don't feel that the rest are lovable. It is probably right that love is slowly created by the mutual approach of both parties. Therefore, if your parents introduce you to marriage, you should ask them to introduce the other party to you, or establish friendship through correspondence or face-to-face meetings, and then talk about marriage. In this way, what is the difference from finding a lover yourself? The only difference is that the introducer is different. Moreover, the family must have done a careful consideration before introducing you to a boyfriend. In some respects, why not have a little more consideration and scruples than free love? You are probably not going to be deceived by dealing with this kind of person. However, if you want to solve marriage in this way, there are two prerequisites. First, you must be thick-skinned and clearly state your requirements. Second, your will must be firm and you cannot blindly follow the family's opinion. I think if you do it properly, there probably won't be any abuse. What do you think? If you think this method still has shortcomings or is difficult to implement, please write to question again. The editor is very willing to raise it for discussion again. Editor</p>

<h3>A Poor Gentleman</h3>
<p>— Written by George Gissing of England, Translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>It was in the parlor, after dinner. Mrs. Carman, a tall and amiable hostess, leaned back in her chair beside her young friend Mrs. Ronning, and asked with a sigh;</p>
<p>"Do you like Mr. Dingballey?"</p>
<p>"A very nice man. Just a bit different."</p>
<p>"Ah, he is special, very different from others. I wanted to tell you about him before we had dinner, but there wasn't time. He is a very old friend of ours. My late husband and he were in the same school—Harrow undergraduates. He is the kindest, the most lovely person! I think he is too good to live in the world; he is very serious about everything. I will never forget his sorrow when my poor husband died—Ada, I am telling Mrs. Ronning about Mr. Dingballey."</p>
<p>She said to her married daughter, a quiet young woman, very similar to the kind face of the deceased Mrs. Carman, but with more reason, a noble, typical meditative calm.</p>
<p>"I felt sad to see his face was so bad," Mrs. Weir replied.</p>
<p>"You know, his face never has any color, and his life...but I must tell you," she turned to Mrs. Ronning. "He is a bachelor, in good circumstances, but—would you believe it?—he lives alone in a very poor area of London. Where is that, Ada?"</p>
<p>"A poor street in Islington."</p>
<p>"Yes. He lives there, probably in a scary hostel—it must be very unhygienic—just to get to know the lives of the poor and help them. Isn't that heroic? He seems to be sacrificing his whole life to that. You never see him anywhere; I think he can only be seen in our house. A noble life! He never talks about it. I believe you would never think of such a thing in his conversation at dinner, would you?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," Mrs. Ronning replied in surprise. "He doesn't talk much. I guess his main interests are in geology and diplomatic theory."</p>

<h3>Education Films in China (4)</h3>
<p>— Lu Shibai</p>
<p>The government has provided considerable moral support for the promotion of educational films. On December 18th of last year, the National Educational Film Promotion Office issued a general order to the educational departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, urging them to cooperate earnestly in the promotion. On January 29th, it also ordered educational administrative organs across the country to vigorously promote film education. However, local educational institutions, though willing, lack the resources to do so. To solve the aforementioned difficulties, I propose the following based on my limited perspective: (1) Regarding provinces, the education department should equip itself with multiple projectors and generators to show films in rural areas without electricity. Zhejiang Province is already planning to implement this measure, with funding provided by the provincial government.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding counties, (A) each county has public welfare funds and reserve funds, etc., from which a portion can be allocated as start-up funds. A small amount of copper coins can be collected from the public to cover ongoing expenses. (B) Films should be shown continuously in local schools, factories, and public education centers.</p>
<p>(3) Organize an Educational Film Association. If funding is genuinely unavailable, the county education bureau should assist enthusiastic local educationists in organizing an Educational Film Association to raise start-up funds from local people.</p>
<p>(5) Producing Films is of Utmost Urgency</p>
<p>As Mr. Cai Yuanpei said at the founding meeting of the China Educational Film Association, "In the future, we must produce our own films, because imported films sometimes lack educational value and are not very effective, or they are too specialized and difficult for the general public or even those with some knowledge to understand. Moreover, the national conditions are different, leading to irrelevant comparisons." Showing foreign films is only the initial step. Self-production is, of course, the fundamental task and the most effective work in social education. Although promotion is not yet widespread today, preparation for production is still necessary. Otherwise, as the number of screening venues increases, domestic films will not be sufficient to meet the demand.</p>
<p>China spends no less than millions each year on social education. The funds allocated by the Boxer Indemnity Committee to support academic institutions amount to no less than hundreds of thousands. If the government could allocate 100,000 yuan annually from social education funds or Boxer Indemnity interest to produce educational films, there would be at least 200 reels of output each year. Furthermore, the quantity of output would increase annually. After five years, the results would be ten times greater than those of public schools or exhibitions.</p>
<p>(6) A Common Goal is Necessary</p>
<p>The profound impact of film education and the importance of producing educational films are as described above. However, its profound impact can become arsenic that endangers the entire nation, or it can become a weapon to revive the nation. Scattershot and speculative films are already harmful enough. We must ensure that educational films, used for education and cultural propaganda, adhere to a consistent and common construction ideology. While the subject matter may be chosen freely, the ultimate aim must be a shared goal. Italian and German Fascism, Soviet Marxism, and Japanese militarist democracy are the common goals of their films. Although China cannot, for the time being, bring the entire film industry to the same position as Soviet Russia in promoting our country's inherent ideology for building a national foundation, at least our educational films should have a unified starting point.</p>
<p>(7) Conclusion</p>
<p>Educational film enterprises are extremely necessary in China, but under economic constraints, there is no opportunity for respite. However, the nation is waiting for educational films to revive it. I sincerely hope that benevolent governments and societies will provide us with assistance. (The End)</p>

<h3>Review of "Headline Shooter" | Greater Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>The monotonous "Happily Ever Afters" and romances are too ordinary and difficult to attract audiences. Therefore, there is a need to inject something new and exciting. "Headline Shooter" is constructed in this way. With a newsreel cameraman and a female reporter as the main characters, "Headline Shooter" can cleverly utilize stimulating material to increase the strength of the drama.</p>
<p>Earthquakes, fires, these kinds of enormous changes in nature, due to their inherent great destructive power, certainly provide a strong stimulus to the audience.</p>
<p>The rattling sound of the camera, the sharp whistle, and all kinds of phenomena during the collapse and disintegration | within these compelling descriptions, the love story of the protagonists unfolds.</p>
<p>Although the scenes depicting the Mississippi River flood seem to lack some stimulation; the tedious love descriptions common in romances are covered up here by the stimulating things like earthquake and flood disasters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what significance does the incorporation of these things have for the value of the play? Very little. It leaves the audience with only a sense of novelty. But how long will this sense of novelty remain with the audience? Ordinary content, even with a novel form, cannot be saved after all, it only ruins that kind of well-worn art.</p>
<p>Since we have analyzed those stimuli, there is no need to mention the corruption of river workers. In "Headline Shooter", the fundamental aim is just to make the structure of an ordinary romance more complex and tortuous. Novelty and complexity are the attitude of those producers. Faced with serious social problems, they only know how to decorate them with novelty and complexity.</p>
<p>"Headline Shooter"'s consistent attitude, in the end, deliberately creates a breakup between Jenny and Bill, and then uses Jenny's disappearance to re-develop the plot. This kind of indirect writing ultimately failed to make "Headline Shooter" moving at all, and because the earthquake depiction in the front was more stimulating, it caused "Headline Shooter" to create a climax in the form of a detective film, but it seemed to lack power.</p>
<p>In reality, this was originally a small-town romance. There is nothing other than dedication to duty and sweet love. However, in the present, these often only exist in their illusions. The meaning of spreading this kind of illusion is, of course, easily understood.</p>
<p>"Headline Shooter," which has incorporated some novel things and has everything covered up by these novelties, leaves behind emptiness!</p>
<p>William Gargan and Frances Dee's acting is competent.</p>

<h3>Review of "Tears of Pear Blossoms"</h3>
<p>— Fu Li</p>
<p>In terms of theatrical performance, "Tears of Pear Blossoms" is indeed a tragic play that faithfully reflects the dark side of society. It depicts two sisters with different personalities. The older sister has a deeper understanding of society. But what about the younger sister? She is a weak-willed woman who covets vanity and material enjoyment. Therefore, under such different personalities, the younger sister finally "ruined her future for the sake of her future."</p>
<p>The director handles such a plot, unfolding it very tensely from beginning to end. The technique is concise and clear.</p>
<p>There is no waste, which gives us considerable satisfaction. Several contrasts further increase the drama's stimulation. The rich are indulging in sensual pleasures and gambling. In their eyes, women are nothing more than toys. Therefore, the suffering of weak-willed women after being abandoned by them, like Xiao Ying in society, is truly unknown to how many? This is indeed as the author said: "Since Heaven created man, why create disasters to destroy mankind, and entice and provoke the minds of good human beings, making them restless. Blindly follow, blindly chase, chase straight into the fiery pit of depravity"?</p>
<p>In terms of makeup, Xiao Qin and Xiao Ying's heads of permed hair, and curved, slender eyebrows, are too unlike poor women. Although these are minor details, the authenticity of the film should not be lost.</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors, Tan Ying has indeed improved compared to before. The depth of her facial expressions makes the audience shed tears of sympathy. Gao Zhanfei's Liu Liangcai also fits the personality of the character in the play very well. Chen Yanyan's Xiao Ying, the liveliness in the first part is like a lively little bird, and the worry and disappointment in the later part are also very sympathetic and lamentable.</p>
<h3>Scattered Petals</h3>
<p>— You Cheng</p>
<p>The film "Red Chamber Spring Depths," starring Chen Yumei, features a scene from the historical drama "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," which is entirely sung with sound dialogue and is exceptionally wonderful.</p>
<p>The scripts of "Smoke" to be directed by Star's Shen Xicen and "Cloud" to be directed by Lianhua's Wu Cun have both been rejected by the censorship committee and therefore cannot be filmed.</p>
<p>The sound film "Happy Rivals" starring Chen Yumei has now been sent to Beijing for censorship.</p>
<p>"Spring Night Song" went to the Huangpu River Wharf yesterday morning to shoot exterior scenes of ships arriving at the port.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday, dozens of female students from a certain girls' school visited Tianyi. The filming of the slapstick comedy "Mr. Wang" was underway at the photography studio, and the female students laughed incessantly at the comical expressions of the actors.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the sixth, the Tianyi basketball team and the mechanical engineering department basketball team of China Vocational High School met at the Tianyi basketball court. In the first half, Tianyi was at a disadvantage, losing by two points. After switching sides and fighting again, through the efforts of Tianyi's athletes, the result was a score of thirty-eight to thirty-six, and Tianyi turned defeat into victory.</p>

<h3>The House of Rothschild (15)</h3>
<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>Fitzroy said, "But there's no way, I still love Julie." Nathan said, "Julie is a Rothschild, and she cannot marry without her father's consent." As Nathan said this, Hannah suddenly called him, and at the same time, Amschel shouted in panic, "Napoleon has escaped!" Nathan hurried over. Fitzroy was left alone, terrified and pale. He stood blankly for a moment, then suddenly ran out, mounted his horse, and galloped away. Amschel said, "This time, the map of Europe is going to change color." Nathan pondered silently, and after a while, he said, "I know." Amschel said, "The ambassadors of various countries in London must be flocking to your office." Nathan declared firmly, "I'll stay here. They're going to ask the Rothschilds for help again. It's time for them to need money again. Well, whoever needs money, let them come to this ditch!"</p>
<p>At that time, it was indeed a earth-shattering upheaval. Ever since Napoleon escaped from the island, all of Europe was in a state of panic. Government leaders and military commanders were in secret discussions day and night. Bankers and ambassadors were conferring. Rumors were rife. Some said that Louis' troops had already lost their morale and most would defect to Napoleon. Others said that Napoleon already had 500,000 troops massed on the French border. Still others said that Napoleon had borrowed a large sum from the Rothschild family, with full repayment and double interest guaranteed. General Wellington also said that this matter was too thorny. To mobilize troops to stop him, tens of millions of military expenses had to be raised first, and the troops had to be arranged for ninety miles in length. General Blücher also said, "Not only should the Allied troops be ninety miles long, but they should also be thirty miles deep." Wellington said, "If there is money, soldiers can be recruited to the battlefield to sweep Napoleon from the face of the earth; if there is no money, even the surface of the earth itself will be changed..."</p>
<p>At this time, in Frankfurt, in the Rothschild's home, the five brothers were also discussing this important matter. They had previously created peace for Europe, but that peace had increased their deep pain and enormous wounds. Once the Allied countries no longer needed them, they were attacked with arrows and stones—the Jews, and the oppression was even deeper than before. Therefore, many of the brothers advocated that this time they should change their policy and side with Napoleon. Kalmann Rothschild said, "If we reject Napoleon's request, the danger is extremely great, and the financial loss will be infinite. First, James's business in Paris will inevitably be wiped out, and then Amschel's and Solomon's will be in great danger..." Amschel also said, "For two or thirty years, we have done our best to serve the Allied countries, but what have we gotten in return? Although we have good homes, carriages, clothes, etc., as far as the Jews are concerned, is it not the same as before—living on Jewish Street, waiting for them to come and chain us up! So I suggest that this time we should shift our strength to Napoleon's side and start anew with him!" After he finished speaking, he looked at Nathan, waiting for him to express his opinion. He pondered silently, and his mother urged him, "My son, what do you say?" Nathan then expressed his views: (To be continued)</p>
