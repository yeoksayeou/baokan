<p>（一）廢除華府海約之理由、乃以該條約之訂立當時、其國際情勢固屬充分適合、但其後國際形勢極生變化、其造艦技術術亦甚進步、事實上殊覺不同、是以該項案約確有廢除之必要、（二）縮少軍備乃該會議之根本主要精神、故須竭力不使軍備擴張、而便貫澈其初衷、（三）至於不與他國以威脅及不受他國之威脅、乃爲日本確切不移之方針、故須以充當防守而不應以徒事攻擊之方針而向之邁進、（四）盡量廢除攻擊武器、但須完備充實其防備之武器、（五）在倫敦會議則以比率主義而决定軍縮、此爲該會議得到成功之要旨、故日本素來反對比率主義、曾經出席倫敦會議之首席全權代表若槻氏、當時亦聲明該項要旨、而闡明日本所取之態度矣、（三十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　爲應付英國所主唱之艦隊縮少起見、美國海軍亦發表有準備縮少主力艦之軍艦噸數三萬二千噸主砲十四時之意、日本海軍對此觀察如下、（一）美國案因輕金屬使用之擴張、乃製艦技術之發達、故其主力艦之質的减少、乃係以能自然縮少爲程度、而對减少現在三萬五千噸十六吋之主力艦之性能、則反對之、故與英國及日本以軍縮精神爲基調、主張减至二萬五千噸以下低下攻擊性能之後、互不攻擊者不同、（一）三萬五千噸之運艦、係能通過巴拿馬運河之最大限度、此次不减少此種性能、反以製艦技術之發達、縮少爲三萬二千噸、使通過巴拿馬運河更加敏速、增大對日本及歐洲之威脅、與從來之東洋作戰計畫並無變化、依此根據美國發表縮少海軍、徒剌激國際感情而已、於達到眞正之軍縮無何等之效果、（三十一日電通電）</p>

<h3 id="c65">英日重訂同盟說　·恒 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>自英國實業聯合會决定派遣實業代表團考察僞滿之消息傳出後。英日同盟復活之謠。遂繼之而起。英國當局雖已聲明爲私人商業行爲。不含政治作用。然世人仍不免有所懷疑。惟以我人觀之。英人之外交。向以老練圓活著稱。方其與人周旋也。非不和顔悅色。以示無他。然絶不能謂其日後必不改變。反之。方其與人確實交好之時。亦必多方隱藏。不令他人窺破。猶憶上次大戰前夕。德國駐英大使。曾請英在德法戰時。保守中立。英人虚與蛇。絶無敵意。詎知德國今日向法宣戰。英人明日卽對德决裂。爲時不過三數日。而前後之態度。判若天淵。據此一端。可概期餘。</p>
<p>或曰。今日握英國之實權者。爲保守黨。昔日締結英日同盟者。亦保守黨。大政方針。未必多異。而况今日英國保守黨之報紙。主張恢復英日同盟者。亦時有所聞。然則兩國重温舊夢。自非絶不可能。此之爲說。似若言之成理。然我人試一爲分析。卽覺天下事理。並不知是之簡單。蓋英國保守黨。一帝國主義的政黨也。其目的常在保持大英帝國之存在與繁榮。苟有一國而危及英帝國之存在者。彼無不設法不以鋤去之。是以日俄戰前。聯日以制俄。及俄敗於日。卽聯俄以制德。可見英人之假想敵、實隨時代而變易者也。今日之國際情勢。固較戰前複雜爲多。與英爭世界霸權者。有日本。有美國。更有國體全異之蘇俄。然美之於英。齟齬雖多。固未至於危及英帝國之存在。蘇俄近年以來國内建設。雖極猛進。然其世界革命之政策。顯已於棄。則亦未至於卽行威脅英帝國之存在。頗爲明顯。故在今日最足爲英人之隱患者。應莫過於睥睨世界之日本。若在今日日俄交閧聲中。助日以敵俄。是不啻爲虎加翼。齎盜以糧以英國當局之老謀深算。必不出此。故今日英人自爲計。至多於日俄日美之間。採取兩無偏倚之中立態度。以自顯其舉足輕重之地位。至恢復英日同盟之說。恐尙非其時也。不然。趕築新加坡軍港。積極擴充海空軍。拒絶日本海軍之平等要求抑又何耶。</p>
<p>且今次英國商人。雖有對僞滿之投資。然該團曁一再聲明純爲經濟目的。不含政治作用。在理自或可信。乃必據此私人行動卽目爲英日同盟恢復之先聲。殊不免於神經過敏之嫌。矧此考察團之成效如何。猶未可知。而英政府亦已對我表示。將來該縱有經濟關係亦必不背不承認僞滿之原則更何必相驚伯有而亡事推測哉。</p>
<p>慨自國難以來。國人好爲籠統糢糊似是而非之論。失望於國聯行動之餘。</p>
<p>乃以爲世界各國皆非我友。旣不必存希望援助之心。亦無需有聯絡親交之舉。一待他人稍與日本接近。則又復譁然鼓噪斥之爲無信義。幾視與日人一丘之貉。實則適中日本孤立中國國際地位之狡謀而已。我人之爲此言。非欲爲英人之行動辯護。乃欲國人於日本歐美之間。稍加區分。俾知可友者友。應仇者仇。國難方殷。貴能不露聲色。沉着應變。若輕信流言。而過事張皇。亦何謂哉。</p>

<p>結婚後的女人底自學問題</p>
<p>丨答劉詢岳丨</p>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>幾年前我曾看過倪煥之丨萁紹鈞著，書上的倪煥之的妻，初時是個極有希望的敎師，但結婚後她却忘記了自己的責任，做良妻賢母去了。雖然在最後著者替她開闢了一條大道，很突兀地轉變了。爲什麽結婚後會忘記自己責任？我們將怎樣使她再明白她的責任，而將她從苦海丨她自以爲樂地吧丨中救出來？</p>
<p>女人，差不多每個女人結緍以後都把前程葬送了。她們唯一希望是養小兒，傳宗接代。她們唯一職務是服侍丈夫，其他一切不管，她們是决不再想上進。這不是瞎說，就我親眼見么的就有不少的例。我有一個朋友，她的女人就我所知，在未結婚前，她是一個聰明的求上進的女子，但結婚後，當我的朋友把淺近的社會科學書給她看時，她滿足地瞧了身旁的孩兒笑着，「我們還要看這些做什麽？」她有時也看小說，但目的只爲消遣。還有我一個堂兄的夫人就更奇怪了。她是某高級中學的畢業生，在校時成績列最優等，但畢業後，就結婚，現在每天的功課除了吃飯睡覺以外只是义麻，雀看電影、神經質的歇斯地利的呆想，她决不看書，通俗到禮拜六派的小說，不鑼大鼓的京戲，她都看不懂，不生興味，我堂兄是研究文學的，初衷是想娶一個對文學有素養的女人丨只有不討厭文學也就好了丨共同研究，其同切磋，但現在是一個等於瞎子的女人伴着他，不，瞎子還自在些，她終日只恐丈夫用功壞了身體，没有一刻不囉囌。我不懂她爲什麽會變成這樣？怎樣使她明白？怎樣使她能自學？希望你們給找一個解答。　劉詢岳啟</p>
<p>劉君所提出的這個問題，誠然是一個有興趣的問題，且因關聯着整個社會的問題，整個婦女問題，又實在是很有意義的。</p>
<p>中國婦女，自五四運動喊出了解放的第一聲後，雖然有少數的少數，已經由閨閣走進了學校，但這少數的少數，也還僅僅限于進進學校而已，並不能向社會再踏入一步。這就如劉君所舉例，即使是在學校最有希望的女子，一結婚後便什麽都完了，這種現象，直至現在，還是非常非常普通的，不獨是那幾個人，幾乎凡有知識的女子，都有陷入這樣的命運的危險，倪煥之是描寫五四前後時代靑年的代表作，所以書中說倪煥之的妻，也不能越出這個時代的定型，倪煥之死後的轉變，不過是作者給新婦女們一點啟示罷了。</p>
<p>于是，社會人士對于婦女的解放就發生懷疑，認爲婦女根本是寄生虫，甘願自暴自棄，不求獨立解放。她們的讀書，只是爲了虚榮，她們的知識，只不過是一種裝飾品，她們借此去博得一個新式女子的頭銜，以示有别于舊式的女子，因此她們可以和高貴的人們交際，戀愛，進而嫁一個高貴的丈夫。她們終生的希望如此而已。</p>

<p>中日網球家表演記</p>
<p>鄭兆佳表演特佳三比六敗於藤倉</p>
<p>邱飛海奔走不遑一比六敗於山岸</p>
<p>日本出席台維斯杯選手山岸等一行、由歐洲歸國過滬、昨日中午十二時半被邀至上海綱球會作表演比賽、慕名往觀者、黄白種人約七八百人、極盛一時、惜比賽中間、秋雨霏霏、减色不少、但觀者因丸旱喜獲甘霖、雖衣履受濕、亦不忍離去、比賽共分單雙打各二塲、全歸日本選手勝利、惟鄭兆佳之表演、有意思不到之美妙、與小藤倉有劇烈之競爭、結果以三比六敗、邱飛海對山岸之單打、全屬一面形勢、山岸牛刀小試、邱飛海招架不遑、六比一、山岸猶未費力、雙打先由藤會與西村、對卡爾生朋尼維臣、精彩甚小、六比四六比二、日選手勝、另一組原定德孚與邱飛海配搭、但德孚跚跚來遲改由卡爾生與邱合山岸與西村第一盤後雨勢益大、興趣大减　結組、對果亦爲六比四、六比二、歸日選手勝、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c204">山岸 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>爲台杯主將、先前祗作雙打、與　　志村爲老搭擋、非特蜚警遠東、即在歐洲亦頗享盛名、提起山岸志村、凡熟悉球者、殆無不知之、第九屆遠東運動會在東京舉行、山岸與今年投海自殺之佐蕂次朗充單打代表、邱飛海與山岸作戰邱力竭而棄權、查山岸又曾至天津表演、出席台杯比賽、已有三四次、今年因佐藤之自殺、遂升任第一單打代表　被澳洲在歐洲帶第二週中淘汰、（四比一）惠勃爾登大會、山岸至第四週失收、觀昨日之表演、少見其眞實功夫正反手抽球、不分軒輊、打出之力道殊足宛如離絃之矢、絶少落網及出界者、遇有機會、穩操勝券、左一記右一記、或深入底綫、或近挑網前、使手無法招架、邱飛海任其玩弄、一籌莫展發球亦殊有力、雙打之高壓擱網、俱甚出色、</p>
<h3 id="c205">藤倉 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>小藤倉爲明治大學畢業、一九三○年明大網球隊一行九人、曾來滬比賽、滬上人士已見其風采渠斯祗十九歲乃兄二十歲、去年去世、斯時之小藤倉、尙爲初出茅蘆、不堪林邱一擊、但三年後今日之藤會、遠非昔比、令人聒目相看、在台杯賽中、曾擊敗澳洲麥格拉斯、取得唯一之勝利、其打法與山岸相仿、射擊殊美麗正反手均佳、閱歷甚深、自殺之球、殊爲少見年少英俊、爲未來之偉大網球家、</p>

<p>渠爲雙打選手、以雙打之打法而論、藤倉似尙不如、高壓甚出色網前工夫亦佳、此人面貌、宛如漁光曲中之韓蘭根初看不像、細看頗像、愈看愈像、</p>
<h3 id="c207">單打 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>鄭兆佳與藤會最先開始、一對少年、打法相同、惟鄭工夫不深、自殺累累、藤倉連勝四局、甚爲容易、鄭見勢不佳、放胆力抽胆量旣壯、手勢亦隨之而順左右掃射、球勢銳急、哈巧過網、藤倉如法泡製、出手均極迅捷、你、記我一記各顯所長煞是好看、博得觀衆掌聲不少、藤倉見來勢兇猛、試以上網、亦不濟事、鄭連得三局之多、但下局輪鄭發球竟告失利、氣勢乃衰、藤倉以六比三勝、繼之爲邱飛海對山岸、邱用心力戰、對手球勢過猛、左面一記、右面再來、邱已不及還架矣、六比一、邱慘收、費時極短、</p>
<h3 id="c208">雙打 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>單打之後、繼以雙打、藤倉西村對卡爾生朋尼維區、毛毛雨下個不休、地滑、球濕、雙方打來、俱無神采、尤以卡爾生朋尼維區、手勢不佳、多觸網及出界球、第一盤略有劇戰、各以發球局勝、卡爾生之發球局失敗後、即以四比六負、第二盤二比六、再負、下次雙打、因長脚德孚來遲、改由卡爾生與邱配合、對山岸與西村組作戰、興趣甚佳、山岸與西村之挑商球、從不出界、且正落在底綫前二三尺處、其高壓能在底綫高殺過網、重如砲彈、不下於一二八之大砲、初亦各以發球局勝、但第五局卡爾生之發球局失去後、遂以四比六負、其時雨益大、以爲停止但邱球興未闌、仍須續賽、衣履潮濕不足惜日選手在英國特製之新網拍、實在可惜、没精打彩中、山岸西村又以六比二勝、秩序乃畢、日選手一行定明晨返日、</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>常用的一級再生力檢波二級低週率放大的三燈收音機，損壞時，祇要一具電表和兩節電池，便可盡修理之能事。但是在多級調整高週率或超等外差式收音機内，那就没有這樣輕而易舉了。</p>
<p>凡是酃敏度（Ｓensitivity）愈佳選擇性（Selectivity）愈好的收音機，牠的調節綫路（Tuned　Circuit）便愈多。現在最複雜的收音機，變量電容器有採用六連以上，調節綫路有多至十級以外者。我們知道。收音機的各級綫路，必須與外來電波盡相諧振（Ｒesonance）時，纔能得到最大的效率。所以採用同軸調節的收音機，不論在任何地位，每級棧路，非絶對同步（Synchronize）不可。換句話說：在任何度數時，各級綫路的磁感量和電容量，必須彼此完全相等纔行。</p>
<p>當然，這些收音機，事先是早已經過製造廠家幾度極精密的較騐後才出售的。但是，長途運輸，使用日久，或是稍受劇烈的震動，都足以使各調節綫路有失掉平衡（Ｂalance）的可能；有時甚至更換一隻新的眞空管，竟也會發生很大的變化。綫路旣失平衡，不僅會重大地影響到收音機的靈敏度和選擇性，並且還會减低輸出的音量，和妨害清唽的音質。</p>
<p>通常較騐失掉平衡的調節綫路，大概是先試收一家遠地電臺的播音，然後再調節各級的補整電容器，（ＴrimmingCondenser）以得到最大的聲浪時爲止。此種較騐方法，事實上是很難準確的。因爲人類的耳朶，辨别小量聲浪的變化，並不十分靈敏；（參閱本刊第四十三斯拙著「電力與音量之比率」）並且遠地遞來之電波，强度時有變化，所以要想得到圓滿的結果確乎是件很不容易的事情。</p>
<p>這樣看來，最好自己能有一架小規模的訊號發射機，纔能應付裕如，不致束手無策。所謂試騐振盪器，（ＴestOscillator）便是應這項需要而設計的。</p>
<p>附圖所示者，爲最簡單之自己調幅（Self-modulated）試騐振盪器。調幅週率之多寡，隨栅漏及栅極電容器之數量而變更。綫圈Ｌ，用二十二號雙紗包綫在二英时半直徑圓筒上繞八十圈，在四十圈上抽一中分綫。（見圖）Ｃ爲00035mfd變量電容器，供調節週率用oCI爲Io_mmf小量變量電容器，供輸送電波用o其餘各零件之數值，均已詳註圖中，茲不贅述。（使用時，Ａ端接收音機的天綫接綫柱，Ｇ端接地綫柱）。</p>
<p>本文爲節省篇幅計，僅略述試騐振盪器之需要及其搆造，至於牠的用法以及多級調整式收音機的較騐法，容再爲文詳述之。</p>
<h3 id="c228">絲極綫路聯接法 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>眞空管使用時，絲極電壓必須絶對準確，因絲極構造脆弱，設或超過其規定值，將使絲極産生大量電流，驟增其熱度，輕則因此而放射過量的電子，减損眞空管壽命，重則可使絲極立時燒斷，毁於瞬息，故設計收音機，勿以絲極綫路較爲簡單而忽視之，初學者尤宜謹愼從事，否則將蒙莫大損失。</p>
<p>收音機内的眞空管數，並不祇限一只，且各個的電壓電流，亦不一定完全相同，所以問題因之而較爲複雜，通常絲極綫路的阰聯接，不外下述三法：</p>
<p>第一法。將各眞空管絲極一一並聯之，然後接以電源，如電源電壓過高不符時，可再串聯一電阻Ｒ，使降落至適當數值，採用此法，唯一的條件，卽各管絲極電壓，必須完全相同者方可。如圖一，Ｒ的數值，可依公式求之：</p>
<p>ＬＥ爲電源電壓，Ｅ１，爲絲極電壓，</p>
<h3 id="c229">圖一　圖二　圖三 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Ｉ１　Ｉ２　Ｉ３　爲各管的絲極電流，例如圖一係３２，３０，３３號三個</p>
<p>眞空管的絲極並聯綫路，各管綫極電流爲·０６，·０６，·２６安培，電壓均同爲二弗打，電源以串聯的兩圓乾電供給之，電壓爲三弗打，依公式計出Ｒ的數值，爲Ｚ·８歐姆</p>
<p>第二法，各管絲極，互相串聯後，再接以電源，電源電壓應等於各管電壓的總和，如過高亦可串聯一電阻Ｒ降落之，採用此法的唯一條件，各管的絲極電流秘須完全相同方可，如圖二，求Ｒ數值的公式爲：</p>
<p>Ｅ爲電源電壓，Ｅ１Ｅ２Ｅ３爲各管的絲極電壓，Ｉ爲電流，例如市上盛行之無電源變壓交流機，其絲極綫路卽採用此法，今假定一四燈機，眞空管式號爲３９３６，３８，２５Ｚ５，其絲極電壓２５Ｚ５爲２５弗打，其餘均爲６·３弗打，絲極電流同爲·３安培，如串聯後直接插至ＩＩＯＶ·交流電源，必須添接電阻Ｒ，依公式計之，應爲２２０歐姆</p>
<p>第三法，亦爲並聯，與第一法相似，惟爲補救各管電壓不同時用之，絲極電壓較低之眞空管，須再單獨接一電阻，ＲＩ降落之，如圖三計算公式爲：</p>
<p>Ｅ１爲共同並聯處的電壓，爲接Ｅ２眞空管的絲極電壓,I1爲其電流,例如圖三,兩只爲201號,一只爲22號。Ｅ１處的電壓卽２０１的絲極電壓，爲五弗打，Ｅ２爲２２的絲極電壓，需３·３强打，其燈絲電流Ｉ１爲·Ｉ３２安培，（此項數字，均可自眞空管特性表上查得Ｒ１之數值，依公式計之，應爲Ｉ３歐姆。</p>
<p>上述三法的選擇决定，須視收音機所採用的眞空管而定，凡各眞空管絲極電壓完全相同者，可用第一法，絲極電流相同者，可用第二法，電壓電流均不同者，則當用第三法。</p>

<p>— 陳克効</p>
<p>現在無線電界，大家都在向超短波方面邁進；而作者却向長波方面跑。這不是替無線電開倒車嗎？不錯。長波的劣點本來是，耗費電力旣大，而效力也遠不及短波。但這隻特長波發報機却例外了。因牠耗電率旣不巨，而發射効力也還不錯，因爲週率近於低週率，所以收報方而的機件，不須檢波器，也可以聞得電訊。所以有介紹給業餘同志的必要。祇是作者，還未將此發報機作遠距離的通訊試騐，這只好請諸業餘家帮着試騐了。這隻特長波發報機線路如左圖。Ｖ用３０或２０１眞空管均可。若用２７Ａ或４７Ａ射程還要遠些，不過Ｂ電要加大就是了，Ｔ是普通的低週率變壓器，一比三，或一比五均可。Ｃ，電容量是四十六兆兆分法拉特，或三十五兆兆分法拉特。控制燈絲電壓的耗阻Ｒ，及Ａ電須視所用眞空管而决定之。Ｋ是電鍵。Ｂ電壓的大小，須視通報的距離而定，大馰１／２哩以内，Ｂ電須２２１／２Ｖ，四五哩以内Ｂ電大概四十五弗打至九十弗打之間。全機最重要的裝置是地線，所以地線，最好用一根長約四五尺的鐵條。打入近潮濕的泥土裏，鐵條留出地面約二寸許，再以一塊銅皮，緊包着鐵條，然後將接地線的皮線用錫銲牢。天線的式子隨便那種都可，然以鳥籠式最好。通報的距離若近，收報方面，祗須將聽筒直接天地綫（，卽將聽筒串連在天地綫中）就可收報了。若用眞空管收音機，那當然更佳，不過波長，愈長，收音成績亦愈滿意，諸業餘家何不將舊零件，接起一試乎。最後作者再說一聲，地綫設計是否優良，對於發報機的射程，收音機的收程，有極大的關係。請注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c231">特效的濾波裝置 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 盧桂珍</p>
<p>線路說明丨此式濾波器，乃採用並聯諧振法與串聯諧振法合併而成者，故其效力頗高，其原理：先由ＬＬＩＣ所組成之濾波器諧振，阻止需要周率電流通過，同時ＣＩＬ２所組成濾波器，亦行諧振，使需要周率電流暢行無阻，蓋需要周率電流因前者電路之迴阻大，後者之迴阻小，故祇能棄難就易也。</p>
<p>裝置丨ＬＬ１爲互感線圈可在一时半直徑管上用三十號漆包線繞九十六圈作ＬＩ，距二分繞Ｌ十五圈Ｃ爲○○○三五ＭＦＤ變量電容器，Ｌ２爲自感量線圈，可用三十號漆包在一时半管上繞六十圈卽得，Ｃ１爲○○○二五ＭＦＤ變量電容器ＬＬ１和Ｌ２之位置，宜成直角，以免發生配合。</p>
<p>效用丨凡選擇力低弱之收音機，此式濾波器均可配上使用，其調節法頗易；先施Ｃ１至容量最大處，再轉收音機之變量電容器至需要周率，再較準Ｃ至同一波長卽可，如遇選擇性尙未滿意時，可將Ｃ１略爲旋出，然後重新較準其他電容器，至滿意爲止。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>劉家莊二十三份人家，每天早晨第個起身的，要算劉二嫂子。</p>
<p>劉二去年春天就寄病死掉，毛丢下三五分田，一間破　壓，伊年紀輕守寡，没有孩子，没有公婆，獨個兒地。伊覺得丈夫生前待自己很好，吃重些的田裏牛活都不呌伊去做。總没這忍心去改嫁，伊做大姑娘的時候就聽得人家說，一個死掉丈夫不改嫁的女人、是了不得的，人家丨或者連衙門老爺都得替伊造牌坊，永遠被人稱讚。</p>
<p>一個人支撑門口開銷睘還省，就是那筆債要月解利息，好像一塊千金石壓住伊，使伊没有鬆動的日子。債是丈夫死時買棺木借　下來，當然要歸伊負責償還，這時没有别法，只有拚命做，自家的田事做完，再替别人家做忙工。眞的，滿材子都說劉二嫂子肯吃苦，耐得住孤獨。</p>
<p>可是，究竟年紀輕啊，生理上的變化是够困人的，還有丨還有那季節和外界的挑引。伊看見許多别人家的媳婦跟丈夫多麽福氣好，在一塊田裏拔草，在一張板桌上吃飯，在一個樹陰下乘凉，自己呢，到什麽地方都是拖着愁鬱的孤獨的影子，耐不住寡居的凄凉味的時候，心就顫動起來。</p>
<p>「我就這樣没有烈性嗎？！」立刻又把顫動的心壓制住，禮敎的鐵壁壁把伊重重圍住，有一座高大的貞節坊豎在伊面前似的，發出苦澀的微笑，使伊又記起丈夫生前的好處和外界許多許多威嚴的評論者的臉。於是，便像一個被監視着的囚犯，做着，拚命地做着，一天，一月，一年···，無窮盡的歲月，無窮盡的孤獨而姜凉的生活。</p>
<p>當伊瞧見一隻雄鷄跟一隻雌鷄追逐於塲角的時候，伊就覺着禽獸的生存比人們暢快，比人們自由，因爲它們根本没有「名譽」這東西。</p>
<p>然而，劉　二嫂子是仍向那榮耀的節婦牌坊上爬，「唉！節婦？」嗟嘆着。</p>

<p>近來又有人主張取銷女袴，代之以裙，這理由自然和裸腿赤足差不多：除此之外，還有一個理由，說是可以對女人减少神秘性。如日本女子不常穿袴子，他們男女間，倒處之泰然，性的問題，並不怎樣放縱；西洋如法國女子，也有不穿袴子，僅御Maillot的，他們也没有什麽流弊。我相信再等幾年之後，中國的女子，一定也不穿袴子了，眞是返到自然。至其結果呢，化裝的消耗，將更足驚人而已！</p>
<p>多年來婦運的結果，難道祇求衣服的解放，性的解放嗎？眞有些奇了！</p>

<p>陳老兒一夜没有安睡，儘量地思索着。</p>
<p>時而横在床上躺一回，時而狠狠地抽幾筒水烟，把芭蕉扇在蚊帳裏面劈劈拍拍的拍得怪響。</p>
<p>這幾個年頭兒，他不知交進了些什麽歹運。自從那回子才巴結上了一個肥缺，很够威風啦，當差的和僕從們給他替班地使喚着。後來不多時，却給政府裁釐裁掉了，稅卡上的差使，收成又旺，又不擔大風險，所以除了這，他簡直什麽事情都不願低就了。可是，坐吃山空，憑着一點兒積蓄，怎經得起他三年五年的用度，早已典質皆空。老妻又在前年物故了，尤其使他痛定思痛。幸而天無絶人之路，女兒長在來，本是别人家的人，不指望伊怎樣的。現在，却全靠着伊的肉來供養了。</p>
<p>他在胡思亂想中，似乎良心上受到了一種嚴重的讉責，但一忽兒又若無其事了。他聽着隔壁女兒房間裏寂靜得一點聲息都没有，丨丨其實，門還是反扃着的，他知道，而且，他什麽都明白；可是，他每天毫不費心的茶飯，還要抽幾口烟，鬥幾張牌，却是那裏來的錢呢！</p>

<p>在曉霧迷茫中，伊帶着一張慘白而呈露着十分疲乏的臉，在一家旅館的門首搖晃着。不多時僱到了一輛洋車，沿着一帶城牆拐過去，S城本没多大，而伊的家進城不多路也就到了。</p>
<p>伊的父親丨陳老兒，正在黑甜鄉中，所以伊掩進了大門，一個人都不會知道的。庭前的宿鳥，還没有飛去，伊什麽都顧不到了，急急地打開了自己的房門進去，把外面的一件紗旗袍卸下了，一翻身，倒在床上，忘記了一切的痛苦。</p>
<p>已是日上三竿了，伊從朦朧中醒過來，一天的事情，洗衣，做飯，什麽都等候着伊一個人擔負起來啦！</p>
<p>伊忽而失掉了些什麽似的，明明方才伊自己因爲太疲乏了，把一張五元的鈔票，隨手擱在桌子上的，已不翼而飛了！</p>

<p>— 子云</p>
<p>某大公司招考女職員的消息，一傳開去，不到一星期，已收到了近三百封報名信，每一封報名信裏，都附着一張四寸的半身照相，和一封信。但是公司裏所需聘用的，只須二十三名，連備取，充極其量，也總不過能錄取五十名而已。而且那時候，董事及高級職員們所介紹的，已内定十一名了。所以在實際上，是僅有十二個額子。</p>
<p>額子只有十二個，但是報名信，却有近三百封，於是由進貨部，人事部，賬務部的三位主任，與恊理所共同組織的考試委員會，先從近三百封的報名信中，依了照相上臉蛋兒的美醜而剔掉了近二百封。留着一百封，通知着在某月某日的上午，來公司面試。</p>
<p>到了那一天的上午陸陸續續地來了七十多位。考試委員會，是設在恊理室裏的。恊理坐在寫字檯上。三位主任，坐在封面的沙發裏。應試的女職員，逐一由茶房引進恊理室，由恊理親自考問。由三位主任各自批分。批分的標準，共分「美麗」「態度」「言語」「耐性」等四項。考完了，用三位的分數平均計算，以定去留。結果，是取了十二名正取，二十三名備取。不過對外發表，是正取二十三名，伐取二十三名。至於薪水，是每月十七元，每天由公司供一頓午膳。</p>

<p>提起了費宮人，人們都會很生疏，很淡漠。倘然我要使您能明白，能感動，那末，我得從伊的本身歷史說起。</p>
<p>可是，話就如此說，倘若我眞去翻開前人所著的「貞娥傳」來照鈔一遍，不惜頂着鈔别人文章的罪名，但文字的冗長也會將您的興剝削得乾凈。</p>
<p>我在這裏只給您一個暗示。</p>
<p>您是聽過「梅博士」的「刺虎」的吧！？倘然您點頭，說是的，那您已經够懂得伊，了解伊，伊是明末一個計保貞操刺殺賊酋的烈女。</p>
<p>有一次，在雪後的黄昏，我和幾個人去到日租界的寓所裏去，拉着朋友，踏着雪地，一路行來，竟走過了老天津城的學宮。原來已經不是租界地方，是到所謂城裏來了。我們的路綫，原是沿着旭街，一直走上了東馬路的。　　　學宮的建築，仍然古香古色，像在這都市裏酣睡着。黄昏的烟霧輕輕的籠罩着它，像織成它的夢影。遠遠看去，南邊還有一座高的建築，彷佛很莊嚴，巍峨。我們急於要瞻仰清楚，又一步一滑的走去。</p>
<p>剛走没有幾步，鑑波像驚訝似的跳起來說：</p>
<p>「原來在這裏！」</p>
<p>失戀的他，我們以爲是發現他的愛子，大家都同聲問他：</p>
<p>「在那裏？」</p>
<p>他笑了笑，指着路旁一個胡同口的小牌樓。我們看了一看，原來上面寫的：。</p>
<p>「明費宮人故里」，</p>
<p>是天津嚴修的手筆。五個大字，筆跡很渾厚雄偉。</p>
<p>幾個人，不顧雪地的泥濘，都跳進了小胡同裏，想來探問明白。第一個碰着的，是個賣大餅的小孩；他說不知道。接着，問一個紳士模樣的中年人，他說，「我也是剛到的」。後來，遇着個很龍鍾的老人家，他纔很誠意的說道：</p>
<p>「這地方是有的；可是房子已經是别家住着。年代久遠，原來的遺跡已經埋没，就是能够辛苦尋得，也没有什麽可看的了。」</p>
<p>我們的訪問因此中止。可是，興致未盡，直到看清了那遠遠的建築是老天津城的鼓樓以後，方纔回來。</p>
<p>吃了晚飯，我馬上在日記本上寫道：</p>
<p>「天津費客人故居，在學宮側數步，鼓樓北」。</p>
<p>恰巧被鼎先生看見了，他笑說道：</p>
<p>「這地方，天津人梅小樹說是「費家巷」。他也曾經在宮人遺像上題過兩首小詩道：</p>
<p>靑史糢糊碧血新，千秋一劍氣彌倫；</p>
<p>同仇尙有秦良玉，殺賊勤王到美人。</p>
<p>貞心如鑑數難徵，遺恨空憐太液凝；　　　　應化西山萬峰雪，寒光常照十三陵。　　　　詩雖是老文章，總算關係文獻，你何不一併鈔下去呢？」</p>

<p>時二十三年八月十五日上午九時一刻。（以跑馬廳的大鐘爲標凖。）</p>
<p>地　靜安寺路馬霍路口電車站。</p>
<p>人　二十歲左右的少女，搽粉，塗胭脂，鵝黄綢旗袍，燙髮，高跟鞋，一個所謂摩登的女性。</p>
<p>事實經過　電車到站，我第一個下來，那少女跟着下來，但伊没有捉牢那根銅柱子，脚便跨下去了，跨下去右脚没有站穩，而左脚又没有一起跳下去，</p>
<p>右脚的高跟鞋脫落了，抛出去約有三五尺，少女便那麽慢吞吞地跌下去了，我想回身去攙，但電車夫已先動手攙了起來。那少女很羞憤，一拐一拐走到人行道上，在呌黄包車，可見伊是跌痛了的，伊面上是一陣紅，一陣白，是懦怒，愧赧，與驚恐的交溶！</p>

<p>— 慧</p>
<p>世上的理論有奇有偶，有反有有正，有一元有多元，如果事物本身之概念不能容許其本身以外之概念存，則正能相對，相反，相激，相成。不則，就錯亂，矛盾，不能自是，更不能他是。</p>
<p>見聞廣博的人，方面多，最容易陷入這一種錯亂的境地。正如算一極複雜的數學題，一不小心愈推愈紛歧愈錯亂了。而不肯用思想的人呢？時常誤于極淺顯的理，爲幾句話支配着腦筯，不肯思想或不慣思想。</p>
<p>持這觀點看時下種種理論，眞是照妖鏡照出了原形。比方，說洋房好，因其光綫好，空氣流通，答覆普通就可分幾種了。一是中國也有好房子，因此洋房不佳。二是住洋房是闊人們，闊人們不好，所以洋房不好。三是洋房太少，中國有百分之九十九以上的人們没有洋房住，我們不應該住洋房，所以洋房不好。四是古代中國人没有洋房住，也健康，因此洋房不好。丨丨這是一例。</p>
<p>這就是答覆者没有思想，或故意說說的。</p>
<p>又例如，尼采的超人原來不過尼采的思想而已。但據說「偉大了的如果只是個人」，「那也</p>
<p>没有絲毫用處」，何以呢？因爲「縱有一百個尼采，在埃及也建築不起百分之一個金字塔」。尼采何以要罰往埃及搬石頭起金字塔，是只有中國思想者才會想得出來。偉大必定有用處，也算奇論之一。「偉大了個人」怎樣没有「用處」呢？眞應歸入「奇論之篇」了丨丨這又是一例。</p>
<p>又是不肯思想，或故意說說的。</p>
<p>普通因爲不思想，所以被幾個肯思想而又有其他作用的人所眩惑。比方「西裝不好論」，</p>
<p>比方「古物救國」的「奇論之篇」，比方「文學不死論」，比方「東方熱心論」·······弄來弄支，連發話者也要糊塗了，原來是未曾思想，或故意說說的。</p>
<p>這些論調，非愚則誣，名曰戲論。</p>
<h3 id="c258">大椿橋的夏夜 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>爲的是城外清靜，便於看書寫作，才搬到這貧民窖的大本營丨大椿橋來。</p>
<p>在長沙住久了的人，幾乎誰都知道大椿橋雖然距離城市太遠，交通不方便，但却是長沙的唯一租界。一九二九年，紅軍進城時，各處都受到一點損失，但大椿橋是平安無恙的。論地勢，大椿橋的確再好没有了！三面都是山，湘江就横在前面；過去幾十步，便是山明水季的鄉村。聽說十年前這兒還是一片荒蕪的墓地，有一條小溪通湘江，溪上架着一條石橋，這就是大椿橋。</p>
<p>自從有錢的財主們在這兒造了房子以後，到這兒來蓋茅棚的，也一天多似一天了。現在大椿橋的居民，除了十分之二是財主，十分之二是小商人外，其餘通通是貧無立錐之地的窮人。</p>
<p>我們起初以爲人烟稀少的地方，空氣一定新鮮，誰知在這兒，却是例外。長萍鐵路就在屋後，每天你可聽到五次像鬼呌一般的火車駛過，還帶來滿天的黑烟。如果那時你的眼睛不小心，向上面開了一下，你立刻就會大呌起來，原來煤灰已經來關照你了。</p>
<p>整天在汽笛聲裏，煤灰烟裏受苦還不算，還要加上推土的獨輪車，整天「旣戒旣戒」不斷地從窗口送進來許多灰塵。像北方刮大風的天氣一般，一小時不抹，桌上的灰，至少有三分厚；假若你繼續坐兩個鐘頭不動，灰塵會把你變成白髮翁，黄臉戲子。</p>
<p>還有更討厭的：一羣小流氓，白天在窗外打球，</p>
<p>晚上無緣無故地抛小石子進來，前天雖然抓了一個流氓頭子送到警察署去了，一連過了兩天的清靜日子，但誰知道他釋放出來後不變本加利呢？</p>
<p>幾個朋友都勸我們搬家，但一想到大椿橋實在有牠的好處，便又不想搬了。</p>
<p>在我們的房子過去兩家，住着兩個算命瞎子，三個拾煤渣的小孩，賣車麻糖的福牙子，擺荒貨灘的王二，接生婆福嫂子，拉洋車的四麻子，還有一羣剛從農村逃荒來的難民，和幾個天天被人家唾駡，没有名姓的呌化子。他們有的和猪睡在一塊，中間只隔幾根竹籬；有的一家十多口，住在縱横不到十尺的小茅棚裏；有的竟什麽都没有，只有一隻破碗拿在手裏，白天在大街小巷裏討乞，晚上便隨便倒在什麽毛厠角落裏，一覺睡到大天光。</p>
<p>假若你不怕臭，不怕髒，不怕熱的話，每天晚上你可跑到他們的茅棚裏去談談，包管你會得到無限的新知識。比方前天剛從新化逃荒來的譚某，他會告訴你鄉裏是怎樣天乾，農民餓死和自殺的，是怎樣多得駭人，他說：「這些人死了像狗一樣，用破蓆子捲，便丢到土坑裏去了。」又說：「從前的農民，到了荒年，大家只曉得抱着空肚子餓死，如今，他們却知道組織一隊隊的，去到有谷子的人家裏吃排排飯去。」（註）</p>
<p>拉洋車的四麻子，他也會告訴你警察是怎樣壓迫窮人，做闊人的走狗。汽車來了，如果洋車停慢了一脚，立刻就用棍子打個半死，「他媽的，有次我看見汽車裏只有一個司機，警察也向他立正敬禮。哈哈，他媽的臭巴結丨</p>
<p>此外如福牙子，劉瞎子·······他們會各人告訴你許多不同的故事，這些都是你最好的文章材料。</p>
<p>從大椿橋走過去，不到百步，這一帶的麽鳳鳴園，ＸＸ園，都是停寄棺材的地方。有時每天都可看到幾千人送葬的棺材，吹吹打打從城内抬來、（自然，這些是要人或者次要人的夫人太夫人等等。）只要不是瞎子，誰都要跑去看一下熱閙：但他們看了回來，却又要駡着</p>
<p>「他媽的，這樣闊氣，那裏來的錢？」</p>
<p>晚上，黑黝黝的馬路上，（本來有一盞街燈的，但早已壞了。）横一個，直一個的躺着許多僅僅掛一條破褲子的男人，小孩。有綫的老爺太太們半夜從戲院回來，如果踼了王二的頭，或者踐踏了福牙子的脚、她一定惡狠狠地大聲駡着：「好狗不攔路，這些没有欄關的畜生，眞該死！」</p>
<p>這駡聲，有時會將你的好夢驚醒。</p>
<p>大椿橋，這就是大椿橋的夏夜。</p>
<p>「註」成羣結隊的農民，在天旱時，向地主家裏去吃飯，吃完一家，又另去一家，這就呌做吃排排飯，也有只呌吃排飯的。</p>

<p>（七）不識字的作家</p>
<p>用那麽艱難的文字寫出來的古語摘要，我們先前也呌「文」，現在新派一點的呌「文學」，這不是從「文學子遊子夏」上割下來的，是從日本輸入，他們的對於英文Literature的譯名。會寫寫這樣的「文」的，現在是寫白話也可以了，就呌作「文學家」，或者呌「作家」。</p>
<p>文學的存在條件首先要會寫字，那麽，不識字的文盲羣裏，當然不會有文學家的了。然而家却有的。你們不要太早的笑我，我還有話說。我想，人類是在未有文字之前，就有了創作的，可惜没有人記下，也没有法子記下。我們的祖先的原始人，原是連話也不會說的，爲了共同勞作，必需發表意見，才漸漸的練出複雜的聲音來，假如那時大家抬木頭，都覺得喫力了，却想不到發表，其中有一個呌道「杭育杭育」，那麽，這就是創作；大家也要佩服，應用的，這就等於出版；倘若用什麽記號留存了下來，這就是文學；他當然就是作家，也是文學家，是「杭育杭派」。不要笑，這作品確也幼稚得很，但古人不及今人的地方是很多的，這正是其一。就是周朝的什麽「關關睢鳩，在河之洲，窈窕淑女，君子好逑罷，牠是「詩經」裏的頭一篇，所以嚇得我們只好磕頭佩服，假如先前未曾有過這樣的一篇詩，現在的新詩人用這意思做一首白話詩，到無論什麽副刊上去投稿試試罷，我看十之九是要被編輯者塞進字紙簍去的。「漂亮的好小姐呀，是少爺的好一對兒！」什麽話呢？</p>
<p>就是詩經」的「國風」裏的東西，好許多也是不識字的無名氏作品，因爲比較的優秀，大家口口相傳的。王官們檢出牠可作行政上參考的記錄了下來，此外消滅的正不知有多少。希臘人荷馬丨丨我們姑且當作有這樣一個人丨丨的兩大史詩，也原是口吟，現存的是别人的記錄。東晋到齊陳的一子夜歌」和「讀曲歌」之類，唐朝的「竹枝詞」和「柳枝詞」之類，原都是無名氏的創作，經文人的採錄和潤色之後，留傳下來的。這一潤色，留傳固然留傳了，但可惜的是一定失去了許多本來面目。到現在，到處有民謠，山歌，漁歌等，這就是不識字的詩人的作品：也傳述着童話和故事，這就是不識字的小說家的作品：他們，就都是不識字的作家。</p>
<p>但是，因爲没有記錄作品的東西，又很容易消滅，流布的範圍也不能很廣大，知道的人們也就很少了，偶有一點爲文人所見，往往倒喫驚，吸入自己的作品中，作爲新的養料。</p>
<p>舊文學衰頽時，因爲攝取民間文學或外國文學而起一個新的轉變，這例子是常見於文學史上的。不識字的作家雖然不及文人的細膩，但他却剛健，清新。</p>
<p>要這樣的作品爲大家所共有，首先也就是要這作家能寫字，同時也還要讀者們能識字以至能寫字，一句話：將文字交給一切人。</p>

<p>後來在無可如何中，媽只好但願他是向着親戚那兒去的。揀好了許多他的衣裳，裝在我的箱子裏，還特别把弟弟平日心愛的一個餅乾筒子拿出來裝進一些糖炒的米花進去。　　　　「你去見着弟弟說，給，這是他的，呌他不要忘了媽媽······」</p>
<p>媽說到這裏簡直又哽咽地哭起來了，涙水一顆顆地滴進米花筒子裏。</p>
<p>「我怎麽想得完呵！你還没有回家的時候，他說，媽媽，你老人家也辛若了，明年我來看店子。我說，·····他又說，媽媽，你不要給我做衣裳了，哥哥的我還可以穿，······哪曉得他才騙了我走了呵！他丢了這許多想頭，我怎麽·····」</p>
<p>媽又湧着涙水說不下去了。我眞慚愧，無可如何地站在旁邊。</p>
<p>「媽媽，弟弟不會走失的，一定是到那邊去了，我不要坐轎子了。我也走路去。」</p>
<p>媽斗然把眼睛睜大起來，望着我，感動得嘴唇非常顫動。</p>
<p>「不，」她說。「轎子已經訂好了，坐去，不要給人家笑話！還是坐轎子去，娘就是吃稀飯也不要緊。只要你們在外邊好好做事，一天高升一天，掙得錢回來。你只要去記得給弟弟說，不要忘了媽媽······」</p>
<p>我坐着轎子，在許多羨慕的眼光中離開家鄉，到了親戚那兒的時候，果然他們嚷着弟弟已經在那兒了。他們原來說馬上呌他回來的，可是他無論如何不肯，他說他當火伕都幹的。他們就只好把他留在這兒當弁兵了。</p>
<p>我到的這天，很想馬上見到他，可是他怎麽也不來。一直到第三天上我才在書記處的門口見他興冲冲地跑了來，我幾乎不認得了。他的身上已經的换了灰布軍衣，掛着一隻小小的白即寗。他這樣的變化，我心裏面感着了些兒的微痛。想着我們這樣的分歧，我簡直非常的不安。才要招呼他，可是他一掉頭就飛跑出去了。以後雖然見了面，然而也僅僅是三兩句，没有一點好聲息丨丨</p>

<p>The False Plainclothes Brigade Has Fled Elsewhere</p>
<p>Before Leaving, Over a Hundred Houses Were Burned</p>
<p>The Militia and Police Are Following to Suppress Them</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The false plainclothes brigade entrenched in Yutian Gaoqiao Town was broken up on the 30th by a joint force of the Yutian Security Supplement Team and the militia from the four counties of Zunhua, Qian'an, Ji County, and Yutian. The bandits looted the entire town, kidnapped more than thirty men and women, and fled towards the northern direction of Zunhua. Gaoqiao Town was occupied by the bandits for several days, during which more than forty farmers were brutally killed, and countless women were raped and committed suicide. Before leaving, the bandits set fire to more than a hundred houses. It is reported that the militia from Zunhua and Ji County are still relentlessly pursuing them. According to a certain important person, the false plainclothes brigade that is disrupting the war zone is indeed the old部 of Liu Guitang, who fled from a certain place and is being manipulated by someone, intending to cause chaos in the war zone so that our newly formed special police team cannot enter, and the old security team has no time to leave. However, this intention is indirectly the work of certain people, and not the true intention of certain party. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 6:00 pm on the 30th, four bandits broke into the Qing'en Qian Dian on Nanmen Street, Shanhaiguan, and robbed 160 yuan in cash. At about 11:00 pm, a group of bandits, numbering about dozens, were found in the Qingsha tent of the Sanqingguan in the suburbs. They opened fire on the local police card. A large team of police rushed to the scene upon hearing the report and exchanged fire with the bandits for two hours, separated by the Qingsha tent. The bandits then fled. It is reported that there are more and more deserters from the puppet army outside the Great Wall who have entered the pass and become bandits. Because the people in various cities and towns are poor and financially exhausted, more and more good people are turning into thieves.

At worst, their bandit forces may take the opportunity to rob several places because our defense is too strict. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Over a Hundred Casualties, Mostly Japanese</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 9:30 last night, passenger train No. 11, which departed from Harbin for Changchun, derailed at 10:30 at a place 42 kilometers from Harbin (near Wujia Station) due to the tracks being destroyed by the 義勇軍. More than a hundred 義勇軍, lying in ambush nearby, came out and used machine guns and rifles to attack the overturned train and the train that was spared from overturning. Then they approached and entered the train. They shot at Japanese people or those who resisted. After three quarters of an hour, the 義勇軍 voluntarily withdrew. Before leaving, they captured Uchida, an official of the Japan Resources Bureau, and technician Fujisawa. Among the Japanese passengers were 80 members of the Ehime Prefecture Education Inspection Group. In the end, 10 Japanese people died and 9 were seriously injured. There was also 1 Chinese person seriously injured, 3 Russian people seriously injured, and 3 railway staff seriously injured. More than 10 Japanese soldiers on the train, including 1 dead and 3 injured. A total of 36 people were killed or injured. After the train derailed, the Japanese army and puppet police team stationed at Wujia Station rushed to the scene. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army stationed in Harbin was extremely panicked because it was an incident on the southern section. They immediately dispatched more than 200 people on armored trains, but they did not see any trace of the 義勇軍. (31st Hualian Electric)</p>
<p>(Changchun) At 9:50 last night, a passenger train on the southern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Harbin to Changchun derailed suddenly between Wujiazi and Shuangchengpu at 0:40 am due to a section of the track being removed by the 義勇軍. At that time, the 義勇軍 lying in ambush nearby immediately shot at the passengers, the situation was very tragic. Fortunately, the Japanese guards on the train immediately returned fire and repelled the 義勇軍 after an hour of fighting. At 2:40 am, Harbin urgently dispatched an ambulance to the scene, and the 義勇軍 fled in all directions. There were many Japanese and Manchu passengers on the affected train, including the Harbin Railway baseball team, the Ehime Prefecture Education Inspection Group, Dahe Uchiko, and the two officials of the Resources Bureau, Fujisawa Takeo and Uchida Genbei, who went to Manchuria to build the Continental Science Research Institute, more than 80 Japanese people in total, and the remains of Vice Councilor Iwanaga, who was killed in the previous Yingkou No. 1 ship incident, were all on the train. According to the telegram received by the "Manchu National Government", 5 people were killed and more than 100 were seriously or slightly injured. Also, Fujisawa and Uchida, two officials of the Resources Bureau, and 7 members of the Education Inspection Group, seemed to have been kidnapped by the 義勇軍, but the remains of Mr. Iwanaga and his entourage were safe and sound.

<p>(Harbin) Yesterday a train on the Chinese Eastern Railway derailed at a location 26 miles south of Harbin. The number of dead and injured was unprecedented in train accidents. There were especially many Japanese, 13 dead and 8 injured, mostly tourists. 5 Chinese people died and 21 were injured. It is now believed that there were several foreign passengers on the train. Among them, three are missing, and it is feared that they have been kidnapped by the "bandits" who destroyed the train. 6 Japanese passengers were kidnapped, and foreigners may also have been kidnapped. Among them were two American women. Among the injured was a Russian passenger and 7 Chinese passengers, all of whom were sent back to Harbin by a hospital car. The three missing foreigners were all employees of MGM Pictures. One was Mr. Johansson, the manager of the company's Osaka branch, one was Mr. Russell of the Tokyo branch, and one was Mr. Ruri, the representative stationed in Manchuria. All three were in Manchuria for company business. The "bandits" still used their usual tactics, demolishing the tracks. When the train drove to the place, it derailed and overturned, resulting in four cars being destroyed and the passengers being shocked, with corpses crushed and bodies split and unrecognizable. After the train stopped, the "bandits" fired machine guns from their ambush, and then occupied the first-class and third-class passenger cars, but were unable to loot because the Japanese guards in the train immediately fought with the "bandits", fighting for two full hours before repelling the "bandits". The bandits kidnapped many passengers and fled. It rained heavily today, hindering rescue work. All the injured have been rescued and sent to Harbin for treatment. However, several corpses crushed under the car have not yet been found.</p>
<p>Follow-up telegram: It is now learned that Mr. Russell of the MGM Tokyo branch was not kidnapped by bandits and was not injured. The bandits used rifle butts to smash his room door, but failed to break it, and he was spared. Mr. Johansson and Mr. Ruri have indeed been kidnapped. (31st Reuters Electric)</p>

Fu of Suiyuan has ordered the 13th Division to dispatch troops to suppress them strictly. In order to maintain the治安 of the Ping-Sui Railway, Feng has dispatched a unit to Taobqi, Baitagou and other places to prevent scattered bandits from causing disturbances.

<p>(Nanjing) An important person said that the issue of representatives to the Fifth National Congress: in the past, the attending representatives of the congress were all appointed by the central government, so there were many criticisms from all parties. At this congress, the appointment system of attending representatives will be abolished, and the representatives elected last year will attend. Eighty to ninety percent of the provinces have been elected, and those that have not been elected have been ordered to be elected immediately and reported to the meeting. In special circumstances where elected representatives cannot be produced, such as in the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, the right to appoint representatives to attend will be exercised, and although their qualifications are not limited to those of the three northeastern provinces, those who have a historical relationship with the party affairs of the three provinces are suitable. They will be appointed by the central government before the meeting. Regarding the scope of proposals for the congress, the central government has notified party headquarters at home and abroad, and none have been sent yet. Generally, the provinces and cities will successively send them to the capital in October. As for how the central government will propose, it has not yet considered this. It must be decided by the central standing committee meeting more than ten days before the meeting. Other issues, such as the improvement of party affairs, will also be proposed. The southwest is very supportive of the congress. According to the party constitution, the congress has been postponed for one year, and it cannot be postponed again this year. The central government hopes that Committee Member Hu Hanmin will come to the capital to attend. It is unknown whether he will come. As for the other members of the southwest, according to Li Ciwen, a new central committee member returning from Guangdong, it is hoped that they will all attend. It is difficult to predict whether all the members of the southwest will come at that time. With the exception of a small number who have important military and political responsibilities and cannot leave, there seems to be no reason to evade. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

The border of Lianjiang was also not in a state of terror. The bandits retreating towards Zhejiang Province were only a few hundred people and have been surrounded, so the claim that there was a fierce battle on the border of Zhejiang is also absolutely unfounded. Also, the Guangzhou telegram claiming that the Xiang Army defeated the bandits and 共and then recovered Guidong is also bizarre.

According to him: (1) There are more than 3 million disaster victims in the 43 counties of the Hubei disaster area, with losses of more than 100 million. It is impossible to avert the catastrophe without central government subsidies and gentry donations. He had stated the disaster situation and relief plan to Jiang, Wang, Kong, and others in Lu, and asked for remedies. After several discussions, they agreed to find a way to consider it. Kong agreed to facilitate the transportation and regulation of grain, mainly purchasing domestic rice, and purchasing foreign rice only when necessary. (2) There is no definite date for Huang Fu to go north. Huang's work in Ping in the past was inevitably painful, so his attitude this time is passive. He is still staying in Lushan. After persuasion by Zhong, he will still go north to preside over the work. (3) The central government has comforted Liu Xiang for his resignation and helped 共to overcome difficulties. He himself also believes that the task of suppressing bandits is important and should not be spoken lightly. (4) The provincial treasury will work in the same office on September 1.

Instead of building a new one, it would be better to utilize the old mint, which would save on national funds and help regulate the finances of North China. The 400,000 yuan owed to the Japanese side by the mint has already been advanced by the province. Currently, the creditors, besides the province, include the banking sector, which is owed 3 million yuan. However, after the restoration, gradual repayment will be easier to manage.

If so, the only country that has not joined the League before Germany and Japan withdrew in 1935 is the United States. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned today that the Council of the League of Nations intends to hold a closed-door meeting on September 8 to discuss the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League. A draft resolution unanimously supporting Soviet Russia's accession has been completed and will soon be submitted to the Council. If the resolution is unanimously accepted by the member states, the Soviet government will submit a satisfactory response before the League's General Assembly officially opens on September 10. The Council will then submit the resolution to the General Assembly. The Council is currently conducting diplomatic inquiries to determine whether the resolution can be passed by the entire General Assembly. (31st National Telegram)</p>

<p>Obstacles Not Entirely Removed</p>
<p>Religious Policy is the Main Reason for Opposition from Various Countries</p>
<p>(London) It appears that Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations will not be as easy as expected. Switzerland is deeply concerned about the increasing communist activities and is determined to oppose it. Several Swiss newspapers are now advocating that if the League of Nations allows Soviet Russia to join, Switzerland should withdraw. Poland will also oppose the move due to the recent friendly relations between Poland and Germany and its jealousy of the Franco-Soviet agreement. Furthermore, once Soviet Russia joins, it will occupy a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations, a seat that Poland has been seeking for many years without success, causing considerable resentment. In addition, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Austria, Ireland, and several South American countries do not support Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations. However, they will likely abstain from voting, which will not affect the resolution, as abstentions are not considered opposition. Soviet Russia's anti-religious policy is the main reason for opposition from various countries, especially Catholic countries. The Universal Christian Conference held in Fano, Italy, passed a resolution last night hoping to inform Soviet Russia that all member states of the League of Nations should have the responsibility to implement freedom of religious education and distribution. This matter is particularly noteworthy. Although rejecting Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations may not materialize, if member states of the League of Nations show any opposition, Soviet Russia, even if it sincerely seeks a way to secure itself between Germany and Japan, will certainly withdraw in anger, which will leave the League of Nations as weak as ever. All those who support the League of Nations are now worried about this. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Explains Naval Policy</p>
<p>Strongly Advocates Abolishing Naval Treaty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's Cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Hirota first addressed the government's policy on the disarmament preparatory conference, stating that after the Cabinet meeting adjourned on the 28th, the three ministers exchanged views and had already decided on the fundamental policy. However, some details have not yet been decided. After discussion, it can be submitted to the Cabinet meeting on September 4 or 7, but the premise is to explain the history of the Washington and London conferences for reference. Next, Naval Minister Osumi provided explanations on technical issues. (31st Rengo Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's policy for attending the disarmament conference preparatory negotiations may be decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 4th or 7th of this month. However, at the Cabinet meeting on the 31st, Naval Minister Osumi explained the fundamental policy in response to questions from cabinet members as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The reason for abolishing the Washington Naval Treaty is that the international situation was fully suitable at the time the treaty was signed, but the international situation has changed greatly since then, and shipbuilding technology has also advanced significantly. The facts are quite different, so the treaty definitely needs to be abolished. (2) Reducing armaments is the fundamental and main spirit of the conference, so efforts must be made to prevent the expansion of armaments and to implement the original intention. (3) Not threatening other countries and not being threatened by other countries is Japan's unwavering policy, so it must be pursued with a policy of acting defensively and not engaging in pointless attacks. (4) Eliminate offensive weapons as much as possible, but complete and strengthen defensive weapons. (5) At the London Conference, naval reductions were decided based on the principle of ratios, which was the key to the success of the conference. Therefore, Japan has always opposed the principle of ratios, and the chief plenipotentiary representative who attended the London Conference, Wakatsuki, also stated this principle at the time, clarifying Japan's attitude. (31st Rengo Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to cope with Britain's proposal to reduce fleets, the United States Navy has also announced its intention to prepare to reduce the tonnage of battleships to 32,000 tons with 14-inch main guns. The Japanese Navy's observations on this are as follows: (1) The U.S. proposal, due to the expansion of the use of light metals, is a development in shipbuilding technology, so the qualitative reduction of its battleships is to a degree that can be naturally reduced. It opposes reducing the performance of the current 35,000-ton 16-inch battleships. It differs from Britain and Japan, which, based on the spirit of disarmament, advocate reducing the tonnage to less than 25,000 tons, lowering the offensive performance, and then not attacking each other. (2) The 35,000-ton battleship is the maximum size that can pass through the Panama Canal. This time, the performance is not reduced, but the shipbuilding technology is advanced to reduce the tonnage to 32,000 tons, making it faster to pass through the Panama Canal and increasing the threat to Japan and Europe. There is no change from the previous East Asian war plan. According to this, the U.S. announcement of reducing its navy only stimulates international feelings and has no effect on achieving true disarmament. (31st Domei Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) As the Japanese government's disarmament countermeasures are being formulated, the intentions of the major naval powers of Britain and the United States regarding disarmament are also gradually emerging, and the atmosphere of jeopardizing the future of the conference has suddenly intensified.

There is no doubt that if a way can be found to open up the trade between Britain and the Far Eastern countries, which have a lot of room for future development, it will contribute to the increase. The mission is an informal organization, and the Japanese government authorities and business community have welcomed our visit and are providing assistance. The mission is now going east to try to make contact with its business colleagues to increase trade relations between Britain and Japan, and is determined to do so. The entire trip is expected to take more than three months. If the goals can be achieved early, it will be necessary to return home ahead of schedule. (31st Rengo Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e65">On the Revival of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance · Heng <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Since the news spread that the British Federation of Industries had decided to send an industrial delegation to inspect Manchukuo, rumors of a revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance followed. Although the British authorities have declared it a private commercial endeavor, containing no political implications, people still inevitably harbor doubts. However, in our view, British diplomacy is renowned for its sophistication and flexibility. When interacting with others, they invariably present a pleasant demeanor to show no ulterior motives, but one cannot definitively say that they will not change their stance in the future. Conversely, when they are genuinely on good terms with someone, they will deliberately conceal it in many ways, preventing others from discerning their true intentions. I still remember the eve of the last World War. The German ambassador to Britain requested that Britain remain neutral in the event of war between Germany and France. The British responded hypocritically, showing no animosity. Unexpectedly, Germany declared war on France today, and Britain severed ties with Germany the next day. In just a few days, the attitude shifted as drastically as heaven and earth. Based on this one instance, one can infer the rest.</p>
<p>Some might say that the Conservative Party currently holds the real power in Britain, and it was also the Conservative Party that concluded the Anglo-Japanese alliance in the past. The fundamental policies may not differ much. Moreover, newspapers of the British Conservative Party today often advocate for the restoration of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. In that case, it is not entirely impossible for the two countries to rekindle old dreams. This argument seems plausible, but if we analyze it, we realize that the affairs of the world are not as simple as they seem. The British Conservative Party is an imperialistic political party. Its purpose is always to maintain the existence and prosperity of the British Empire. If there is a country that endangers the existence of the British Empire, they will spare no effort to eradicate it. Therefore, before the Russo-Japanese War, they allied with Japan to contain Russia, and when Russia was defeated by Japan, they allied with Russia to contain Germany. It can be seen that the British's hypothetical enemy changes with the times. Today's international situation is indeed more complex than before the war. Those who compete with Britain for world hegemony include Japan, the United States, and even Soviet Russia, which has a completely different national system. However, although there are many conflicts between the United States and Britain, they have not reached the point of endangering the existence of the British Empire. Although Soviet Russia's domestic construction has made great strides in recent years, its policy of world revolution has clearly been abandoned, so it is also not about to threaten the existence of the British Empire. It is quite clear. Therefore, what is most worrying for the British today should be none other than Japan, which is eyeing the world. If today, amidst the clamor of Russo-Japanese relations, they were to help Japan to oppose Russia, it would be tantamount to adding wings to a tiger, supplying a thief with provisions. With the British authorities' cunning and deep calculations, they would certainly not do this. Therefore, in order to protect themselves today, the British will, at most, adopt a neutral attitude of impartiality between Japan and Russia, and Japan and the United States, to show their pivotal position. As for the talk of restoring the Anglo-Japanese alliance, it is probably not yet the time. Otherwise, why would they be rushing to build the Singapore naval base, actively expanding the navy and air force, and rejecting Japan's demand for naval equality?</p>
<p>Moreover, although British businessmen are now investing in Manchukuo, the delegation has repeatedly stated that it is purely for economic purposes and contains no political implications. In reason, this may be credible. However, to regard this private action as a prelude to the restoration of the Anglo-Japanese alliance is inevitably somewhat paranoid. Moreover, it is still unknown what the effectiveness of this inspection team will be, and the British government has also expressed to us that even if there is an economic relationship in the future, it will not violate the principle of not recognizing Manchukuo. Why then should we frighten ourselves and make unfounded speculations?</p>
<p>Since the national crisis, the Chinese people have been fond of making vague and ambiguous arguments that seem to be true but are not. Disappointed with the actions of the League of Nations,</p>
<p>they believe that all countries in the world are not our friends. There is no need to harbor hope for assistance, nor is there a need for liaison and friendly relations. Once others get a little closer to Japan, they clamor and denounce them as untrustworthy, almost regarding them as being in the same boat as the Japanese. In fact, this is precisely the cunning scheme of Japan to isolate China in the international arena. Our saying this is not to defend the actions of the British, but to have the Chinese people slightly distinguish between Japan and Europe and America, so that they know who can be befriended and who should be hated. When the national crisis is at its height, it is important to be able to remain calm and collected, and respond to changes. What is the point of lightly believing rumors and overreacting?</p>
<h3 id="e66">Large-Scale Air Defense Drill Held in Three Major Japanese Cities <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>400,000 Participants</p>
<p>Imagining a Certain Country as the Enemy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The joint air defense drill in the three major cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki will begin tomorrow at 3:00 PM with a simulated slogan: "August 31st, diplomatic relations with a certain country have been severed!" Under this slogan, the atmosphere among all citizens suddenly became tense, and they immediately began air defense work in unison. The general headquarters for the air defense drill is located within the Tokyo Municipal Education Bureau in Shiba Park. From the morning of the 31st, Director Ushizuka led relevant cadres in diligently carrying out various preparations, extremely busy and resembling the panic before a major disaster. The protection team members in all 35 wards of the city number approximately 210,000, with an additional 150,000 specially designated protection team members, plus approximately 50,000 members of the Patriotic Women's Association, totaling 400,000 people. From the morning to the afternoon of the 31st, various division headquarters gathered separately, distributing slogans and leaflets promoting air defense awareness, etc. Amid the gradually increasing tension, they organized and prepared, now merely awaiting the alarm of enemy aircraft attacks in order to listen carefully to the sound of the airplanes.

<h3 id="e67">Italian Fascist Party Newspaper <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Discusses the Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>European Countries Cannot Remain Unaffected by a Russo-Japanese Conflict</p>
<p>Past History Can Serve as a Lesson</p>
<p>Rome The Labor Newspaper of the Fascist Party published an article discussing Germany and the Far Eastern issue, stating that in the current situation, there is more than one factor that could disrupt peace in the Far East. For example, the conflict between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo," Russian exiles engaging in disturbances with Japanese support, and the rumors of Anglo-Japanese consultations are all such factors. Although the Anglo-Japanese consultations cannot be completely believed, they can at least represent a rapprochement between the two countries. In short, Europeans should know that if a war breaks out between Russia and Japan, then Soviet Russia will no longer be able to concern itself with European affairs. If Soviet Russia does not have time to look westward, then Europe will be affected by this. This can be known from the past events of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. At that time, the Russians poured all their efforts into Manchuria, and Germany and Austria took advantage of this, leading to the Tangier crisis in Africa and the Bosnian crisis in Central Europe. In 1904, the Anglo-French Entente was concluded. France recognized Britain's position in Egypt, and Britain also recognized France's special rights in Morocco. Germany was deeply jealous of this, but fearing the strength of the Russo-French alliance, it dared not easily launch an attack. By the end of 1904, the Russian army had suffered successive defeats, and Port Arthur was about to fall. The German Emperor then seized the opportunity and sought to share the benefits of Morocco with the French. On March 30, 1905, the German Emperor personally visited the port of Tangier in Morocco on a warship and issued a declaration stating that his arrival was to protect Germany's rights in Morocco. The momentum was fierce, and the international atmosphere was extremely tense for a time. If the Russian army had not been defeated at that time, the German Emperor's attitude would certainly not have been like this. The Bosnian crisis also occurred after Russia was defeated by Japan. The lands of Bosnia and Herzegovina originally belonged to Turkey. The Treaty of Berlin in 1878 stipulated that Austria should temporarily govern them, but sovereignty still belonged to Turkey. In October 1908, the Vienna government violated the treaty and announced the annexation of the two provinces to Austria. Although Turkey and Russia resolutely protested, it was to no avail. The reason why Austria dared to do so was also because Russia had just been defeated by Japan, the government was facing difficulties, and its military strength was weak. Although it did not approve, it did not have the practical strength to oppose it either. Both of these events are sufficient to serve as a lesson. The National Socialist Party of Germany's hope for serious Russo-Japanese relations is clearly visible. We sincerely hope that peace-loving countries will learn from the lessons of history, be able to calculate the consequences of their actions, and act accordingly to prevent such events from happening.

<p>Germany Resumes Air Force Movement</p>
<p>Le Puy, France The air force exercise was completed at 11:00 AM this morning. This morning, the Blue Aircraft Team re-attacked the Le Puy airfield and various railway stations. According to the General Staff Department's judgment, the Blue Aircraft Team, due to its strong equipment and suitable climate, achieved victory as expected. This exercise determined that the aircraft equipment was satisfactory. Of the 500 airplanes that participated in the exercise, only two lost their combat capabilities. This exercise gained some useful experience for both sky offensive and defensive strategies. (Havas Dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French air force exercise began today. The enemy aircraft team attacked Paris and the Le Bourget airfield for two hours, achieving considerable victory. Forty-eight enemy heavy bombers attacked the Le Bourget Allied airfield with flash bombs, reportedly rendering the airfield "destroyed" in theory. At the same time, Paris also suffered heavy damage. The enemy aircraft all escaped the observation posts. By the time the defending aircraft went into battle, the enemy aircraft had already flown back to their base. However, the anti-aircraft artillery team claimed that in a real air battle, they would have shot down several enemy aircraft. According to the opinions of experts who watched the battle, the defending forces suffered a severe attack. (Reuters Dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The air force held an exercise, attacking Paris. Although the weather was bad, 500 airplanes flew in the sky, colliding with each other without any accidents. Most of the bombers broke through the defense line. According to tactical calculations, it seemed that the Le Bourget airfield near Paris had been bombed twice. Some people believe that if it were a real battle, about half of the attacking airplanes would be shot down before reaching their target. The Morning Post said that the air force commander was satisfied with the strategic and technical results obtained from the exercise. The Echo de Paris believed that if the enemy suddenly attacked with a large number of airplanes, there would be no way to stop them. Therefore, it is necessary to always have a strong air force to fight in the air and seek victory. Former Aviation Minister Côte also published an article in the Enterprise News, saying that there are only three ways to prevent air warfare from being harmful: (1) abolish all military aviation, (2) establish an international supervisory organization to monitor the commercial aviation of various countries, and (3) create an international air force. The People's News stated that previous tests in foreign countries have proved that there is no way to prevent the enemy from attacking from the air. The French exercise has further confirmed this statement. (Havas Dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Federation's Newspaper, the organ of the German International Federation Problems Research Association, still exists after Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. Today, the German government used the newspaper to make propaganda, publishing a lengthy article advocating that Germany should restore its air force. One page depicted a French air force squadron flying eastward, with the French caption "They have set off." The full text discussed "air danger, the development of the air force after the European War, and the French air force weapons and air force, etc." Attached were maps and models of French airplanes after 1932 as evidence. The article stated that other countries have huge air forces, while Germany has nothing. Its conclusion stated that, for the present, there are only two paths to follow: either all countries should abolish their air forces as soon as possible and destroy air force weapons, or Germany must follow the example of other countries and also demand the right to establish an air force to strengthen national defense. Germany is now in danger of being attacked from the air and cannot defend itself. For the sake of the people and the safety of the country, this situation cannot last. The article included several maps of Germany, with its western border still in the state before the European War. (Havas Dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Relations between Germany and Italy are quite tense today. Germany is very angry because the Italian authorities have failed to stop the anti-German propaganda in Italian newspapers. According to the Associated Press, sources believe that Germany is now planning to wait and see for three or four more days, hoping that the Italian newspapers will stop their attacks. If they continue to attack the Hitler government by that time, then the German government may expel all Italian newspaper correspondents. German newspapers have been deeply unhappy for several days. It is said that they have been ordered today to retaliate in the same tone. (National Society Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Italian newspapers have labeled today's Germans as barbarians. German newspapers continue to express their anger at this.

Italian journalists may express their enthusiastic sympathy for the Jewish 'Futurist' art, if they wish. This is a matter for the Italians, and we do not want to interfere.

Germany can obtain the necessary credit and re-emerge as a legitimate buyer in the world market. Participants in the conference included representatives from twenty countries.

<p>Denies Franc Devaluation</p>
<p>The Pound Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Ministry of Finance today vigorously denied rumors of a franc devaluation and insisted that the French franc will continue to be calculated on a gold standard in the future. (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The price of gold in London rose to a new high of one hundred and forty shillings and eleven and a half pence today. Speculators took profits, causing the increase in trading to drop to four pence today, and the increase of the Anglo-American exchange rate of four dollars, ninety-nine cents, eight seventy-five, also dropped to two shillings. The British responsible newspapers do not agree with the continental European fear of the pound's prospects. The Financial Times stated that the weakness of the pound is due to speculation in continental Europe, and that speculation is still ongoing and is very active. Britain has not used the exchange equalization fund recently, so the shorts believe that the fund has been exhausted, but this is not the case. Although this amount has not been used at present, it will definitely be used at the appropriate time, which will be more effective. The fate of the pound cannot be manipulated by foreign speculators, and the British are very calm about this situation, as can be seen from the stability of public debt. Whenever autumn arrives, there is always pressure that is unfavorable to the pound. Now that this pressure has just begun, the pound's weakness may last for a long time, but the amount of foreign funds deposited in London is now limited, so this pressure should not be too heavy. However, since March of this year, the British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Office has sold gold to the Bank of France worth approximately 50 million pounds. The Equalization Fund has been greatly strained by this withdrawal. All British newspapers believe that the pound's short position has now reached a considerable level of selling, because Paris and New York are selling the pound in large quantities. The Financial News stated that France's budget and political difficulties in the autumn may cause French funds to flow back into London and restore the pound to its original state.

<p>Extortion of $168,000</p>
<p>Otherwise, Her Grandchildren Will Be Kidnapped</p>
<p>Former Naval Officer Arrested and Admits Without Hesitation</p>
<p>(New York) Federal secret agents today arrested a man named Vanne, age 33, a former naval officer, who is said to have threatened President and Mrs. Roosevelt, saying that they would be killed and their grandchildren would be kidnapped. The agents are keeping secret whether Vanne has accomplices, but security has been tightened around the President's private residence at Hyde Park. It is said that Vanne sent a threatening letter to Mrs. Roosevelt a few days ago, demanding that she immediately pay him $168,000, or else her grandchildren would be kidnapped. The letter also stated that the money must be paid in bills of $50 or less, or else the Roosevelts would also be in danger. There was no return address in the letter, but there was a New York telephone number. It was later learned that the number belonged to the New York City YMCA, and it is likely that Vanne was arrested there. (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Mrs. Roosevelt recently received a threatening letter demanding a huge sum of $168,000, stating that if she did not pay, the President's three grandchildren would be kidnapped and the President and his wife would be killed. The letter was signed by someone claiming to be acting on "Zangara's orders" (Zangara attempted to assassinate President Roosevelt in Chicago shortly after he was elected, but was unsuccessful, only injuring Chicago Mayor Cermak. Zangara was subsequently executed). It also stated that instructions on how to pay the money would be relayed over the phone. The threatening suspect was arrested in New York and identified as Vanne, age 33, who had served in the Naval Aviation Corps. According to Mrs. Roosevelt, the threatening letter was not sent directly to the Hyde Park villa, but was forwarded from Washington. She immediately turned it over to the police for handling. She also stated that she did not feel any anxiety after receiving the letter. (Havas Dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>Begins a Major Strike</p>
<p>Involving 600,000 Workers</p>
<p>(Washington) All efforts to salvage the nationwide textile industry strike have failed as of today. National Labor Board Chairman Garrison announced that there is still no way to resolve the strike after consulting with Cotton Textile Association President Sloane and United Textile Workers of America Vice President Gorman. Garrison continued to say that the worker leaders rejected the truce proposal and did not want a joint investigation by the National Recovery Administration, the Labor Department, and the National Labor Board. Gorman declared that the union did not want to use riots to force factories to close and has notified workers to maintain order, not to approach the Communist Party, and to suppress Communist Party demonstrations. Regarding the resolution of the dispute, Gorman stated that if the factories cannot make substantial concessions to our demands, then we really have no way. It is now known that the major strike has been decided to begin at 11:30 AM on Saturday. The union ordered 600,000 textile workers nationwide this morning to go on strike on schedule. The strike was originally scheduled to begin today, but was finally postponed to Saturday. The three conditions put forward by the union workers are as follows: (1) changing the weekly 40-hour workweek to a weekly 80-hour workweek, (2) increasing the hourly wage calculated on the basis of a weekly 40-hour workweek, (3) and recognizing the union. It is expected that this major strike will break the record since the union was founded, and will effectively shut down the national textile industry. If this prediction becomes a reality, the economic situation in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Massachusetts will come to a standstill, as more than half of the nation's textile factories are located in these four states. However, the factories also declared that 6,000 cotton workers in the New England area will oppose the strike, which shows that the general strike is not a unanimous action of all workers.

<p>Japanese Mizuno Compiles the Qing Dynasty Veritable Records</p>
<p>Traitor Wu Yanxie Compiles the Fengtian Gazetteer</p>
<p>So-called Founding Expo to be Held</p>
<p>Panyang Dispatch: The so-called Japan-"Manchukuo" Cultural Association, whose president is the rebellious Zheng Xiaoxu and vice-presidents are Okamoto Kageishi (Japanese) and Bao Xi, both councilors of the puppet State Council, has been planning to compile the Qing Dynasty Veritable Records since its establishment. Currently, it has entrusted Mizuno Umeakira (Japanese) to oversee the project, begin collecting reference materials, and proceed with the compilation. At the same time, they are also preparing to reproduce the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries), which is estimated to require one million yuan and has been approved by the puppet government. Furthermore, the Japanese puppet authorities intend to pass on to future generations the historical and geographical development facts of "Fengtian" Province, which represents the Northeast. Therefore, Yuan Jintong, director of the Gazetteer Hall, is compiling the so-called Manchurian Gazetteer, starting from the early days of so-called Manchukuo to modern times. Wu Yanxie, an old traitor in his seventies, is in charge of the "Fengtian" Gazetteer and is diligently drafting it. The other day, Wu's wife passed away, and Wu took a car back to Tianjin, where he gave a speech to the Japanese in the car, roughly stating that the Gazetteer Hall is not only recording the facts of "Fengtian" and Jilin provinces, but also the history, geography, customs, and practices of Hebei, Shandong, and Zhili provinces. Only "Fengtian" Province remains, and it is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The compilation is divided into various sections, totaling over a hundred volumes.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese occupied our Northeast, they have intensified their efforts in industry, trade, and culture.

<p>Both Sides Show a Trend of Compromise</p>
<p>Batavia Special Dispatch: The Japanese-Dutch conference, which was once on the verge of collapse due to the Dutch East Indies government's promulgation of import restrictions on ceramics, has suddenly changed in recent days. The reason is that recently, Japanese Consul General Koshida and Dutch East Indies Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Van Hoofstraaten, as well as Japanese chief representative Nagaoka and Dutch chief representative Meulenaf, have held several secret meetings. Both sides have shown a trend of compromise, so their opinions are gradually converging.</p>
<p>At this conference, the Dutch side originally intended to raise the discussion of maritime transport issues, but due to strong opposition from Tokyo, the Dutch side was extremely dissatisfied. Today, the Dutch side has already made concessions and agreed to raise it at the conference. Although this hurdle has not been resolved, it is clear that both sides have reached a considerable understanding. The so-called maritime transport issue refers to the cargo transport alliance between Java and Japan. In order to avoid fierce competition, the Japanese and Dutch shipping companies reached an agreement on July 10 last year by Nanyang Shipping, Osaka Merchant Shipping, Ishihara Steamship, and Java Shipping, and jointly abide by it. The content of the agreement is very simple, roughly as follows: (1) Navigation: The ships of each company shall not navigate between Java and Japan more than three times a month. (2) Freight: The same tonnage shall be used as a unit, and the freight rate shall be consistent. (3) Resolution: Important matters must be passed unanimously, and minor problems shall be decided by majority. (4) Reserve fund: A joint deposit of 25,000 yuan shall be made as a reserve fund. (5) Withdrawal: Withdrawal from this agreement must be notified three months in advance.</p>
<p>After the establishment of this agreement, the Dutch side discovered many shortcomings and was quite unfavorable to them, so they requested further discussion. In addition, the more important points of understanding between Japan and the Netherlands are: (1) The Dutch side should promise to give considerable consideration to the repeal of the import restriction order on ceramics. (2) In the future, the Dutch side should not impose restrictions on the import of other commodities at the conference.</p>
<p>Because of the above understandings, the future of the conference has shown a glimmer of hope. However, whether the Japanese-Dutch conference can go smoothly from now on, we still dare not be overly optimistic, and we will wait and see what happens.</p>

<p>Dike Breaks for Over a Hundred Zhang in Shangdong Village, Dongguan</p>
<p>Huiyang Becomes a Waterland, Losses in the Millions</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In recent months, the counties in the eastern region of Guangdong Province have been plagued by continuous rain. The Han River and Dongjiang River have caused disastrous floods. The counties along the river have all become waterlands. At the beginning of the month, Meixian County was flooded into the city, and Jiaoling County's suburbs continued to suffer from floods. By the end of this month, the floods from the upper reaches of the Dongjiang River converged and flowed down, so Dongguan, Boluo, Huiyang, and other counties in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River were the first to bear the brunt. The dike in Shangdong Village, District 5, Dongguan County, suddenly collapsed on the 22nd. The dike base at Tanwen in the north of the village collapsed for over a hundred zhang. The houses, fields, livestock, and crops inside the dike were all submerged. Furniture and property were washed away, and thousands of villagers, supporting the old and leading the young, fled to the hills. It was truly an unprecedented disaster, and the losses of the entire village were no less than ten thousand yuan. At the moment, the refugees are eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, and the situation is miserable.</p>
<p>Huiyang County is located where the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River merge with the West River. The eastern flood suddenly rose more than five zhang on the 21st, and after the 21st, it rose nearly a foot every hour. Therefore, under the Bell Tower of Huizhou Prefecture City, Datiehang, Liujiaoting, Xiushui Lake, Ehu, Dashijie, North and South City, as well as the county city's Shuidong Road, Tiejinhu, Huangjiatang, Donggong Bridge, Ximenkou, and the Pubuchang and Tangxia Rice Street outside the city, were all vast and boundless. The water level was as high as the eaves, and the streets and alleys all depended on small boats for transportation. Those with buildings at home were all huddled in the attic, otherwise the whole family would be exposed to the high mounds. The entire city market has been suspended, peddlers have disappeared, and occasionally there are rafts transporting food to supply the refugees in the household. Unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to manipulate the price, and each yuan of rice was one sheng more expensive. Other vegetables were several times more expensive than in the past. The highways from Hui to various counties, such as the Hui-Shan, Hui-Ping, Hui-Bo, Jia-Hui, and Hui-Dan roads, have been washed away by the water. Vehicles have been completely suspended since the 20th. The Hui-Zhang highway is related to the Guang-Jiu railway for joint transportation. The road company tried to use boats to ferry passengers through the flooded areas of the road to maintain transportation. As for telecommunications, due to the telegraph poles being knocked down by the flood, telecommunications were temporarily cut off, and mail was also suspended.</p>
<p>In the Rutengwen area of ​​Rubi Township, Huiyang County, the dike collapsed for dozens of feet, more than 30 houses collapsed, more than 100 acres of rice fields were destroyed, and more than 50 villagers drowned. The agricultural products in Sanduozhu and Pingshan and other places have been completely lost. The remaining low-lying villages along Huibo are all in the water. From a distance, only the tops of the trees can be seen. Refugees gather on the hills, crying for food. Judging from the disaster situation in Huiyang County alone, the loss should be more than one million yuan. In addition, the disaster situations in Boluo and Dongguan are no less than this.

<p>A Puppet Customs Bureau is Smashed on the East Bank of the Gan River</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: On August 18, about 700 Jiangxi Eastern Red bandits from the 5th Independent Regiment of the puppet government, detoured from Huichang to attack Xunwu County. Fortunately, the 囗th Army's 囗th Division, which was stationed nearby, dispatched its subordinate troops to suppress them upon receiving the report. Later, the 囗囗 Battalion took the lead in attacking, and the 囗囗囗 Battalion outflanked them on different routes. The bandits stubbornly resisted on Danzhu Ping Hill. The 囗th Regiment 囗th Battalion used machine guns to strafe the bandit formation, and the 囗th Battalion outflanked the rear of the bandits, and the third battalion blocked the Red bandits' escape route to Qiannan. After a siege of several hours, more than 40 Red bandits were wounded and killed, and more than 90 were captured. The rest of the crowd began to collapse into the mountains. This was one of the battles in which the bandits of the Second Column were deeply wounded after Kejun Gate.</p>
<p>As for the First Column, in recent days, due to the prevalence of bandits in southern Hunan, various units have been ordered to step up their alert. When Xiao bandit harassed southeastern Hunan, more than 100 guerrillas of the puppet Xinkangxiong and Yu counties were suddenly discovered in Nankang County. The 囗th Army stationed in Dayu dispatched troops to surround the bandits on the highlands in the pit. The bandits resisted for about three hours and fled in panic. In this battle, the 囗 team killed more than 30 bandits, captured a puppet platoon attached Wang Xinglong, seized three Hubei-made single-barrel guns, and a large bundle of reactionary propaganda. On the 19th, the 囗th Division of the 囗th Army stationed in Gan County suddenly reported that Jiangkou Red bandits had set up a puppet customs office there. The 囗 division immediately dispatched troops to suppress them overnight, taking the route of Yangtang Dam and Liuhe. It was already about 3:00 in the morning. The bandits were awakened from their sleep and were caught off guard. They were surrounded and disarmed by the 囗 battalion. The remaining bandits fled in the water. When the puppet customs general bureau, the trade bureau, and the cooperative, and other puppet institutions were destroyed, a lot of supplies such as salt, cloth, rice, and oil were seized, as well as two to thirty million yuan of puppet banknotes, a horse, and two puppet cooperative wooden boats. Seven or eighty bandits were killed. It was found that Jiangkou is located on the east bank of the Gan River and borders Yudu, so the Red bandits set up a puppet tax collection agency in other places, and there was also a puppet district and township government and about 100 puppet first advance teams stationed there. Later, it was detected that there were about several hundred bandits ambushing in Datianwei, East Bank, and troops were sent to suppress them. After two hours of fighting, the Red bandits fled to Yudu, leaving behind more than ten guns. Since the Yudu bandits retreated, the 6th Independent Regiment of the puppet government in Huichang again invaded the defense area of ​​the 1st Division of Anyuan, Longbuwei. Yesterday, I received a telegram report from Yu Hanmou, the first army commander, which said, "Confidential, the bandit's puppet 6th Independent Regiment and guerrillas, a total of seven or eight hundred people, attacked on Ma Ri (21st) morning. Our troops fought fiercely with them for two hours, and the bandits fled to Caoziping, still trying to resist with danger. After our army pressed them, they collapsed to Shizizhai. In this battle, more than a hundred bandits were killed along the way, and more than thirty pseudo bandits were captured. Thirty-five rifles were seized. Two soldiers in our army were injured. Yu Hanmou bowed to the stem (23rd) seal" (August 25).</p>

<p>The Yellow River Water Level Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Li Yizhi Telegraphs the Executive Yuan for Instructions</p>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: The Yellow River Conservancy Commission received a report today that at 12:00 on the 28th in Shanzhou, the water level was 292.71 feet, and the flow rate was 3,200 cubic meters per second, which was about 3 centimeters lower than on the 27th. At 8:00 on the 28th at Qinchang, the water level was 94.06 meters, and the flow rate was about 7,000 cubic meters per second. At 12:00, the water level was 94.096 meters, and the flow was quite stable. However, from the 21st to the 26th in Lanzhou, the rain did not stop, and the Yellow River flow rate had reached 50 cubic meters per second. Recently, there has also been heavy rain in Shaanxi. The water potential in the upper reaches is huge, and the river defense of the three provinces will become more tense. In addition to telegraphing the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan and the river affairs bureaus to prepare for emergencies, Li Yizhi telegraphed the Executive Yuan for instructions, saying, "According to reports, the rain has not stopped in Lanzhou from Ma (21st) to You (26th), and the river flow has reached 50 cubic meters per second. Recently, there has also been heavy rain in Shaanxi. If all the water flows to Tongguan at the same time, the downstream river defenses will be tight, and the old mouth of Changyuan, which has been breached and not blocked, will be irretrievable. We have telegraphed the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan and the river affairs bureaus to prepare for emergencies. However, Hebei's flood control is particularly worrying due to the lack of funds and materials. If last year's floods are staged again, not only will the people suffer more, but the government's relief funds will also be spent more. I am worried and dare not remain silent. The time is pressing, and it seems that emergency measures should be taken. How should we handle this? Please give your instructions and I will obey them. Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, sincerely thanks you, seal."</p>

<h3 id="e97">Mongolian Political Committee <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Political Affairs are Virtually at a Standstill</p>
<p>He Yingqin is Too Busy to Concurrently Serve as Director</p>
<p>Ping Dispatch: Yunduan Wangchuk, Chairman of the Mongolian Autonomous Political Committee, previously resigned from his position as League Leader and Zasak of Ulanqab League to the Mongolian-Tibetan Council, in order to dedicate himself to serving as a member of the Mongolian Political Committee. After being comforted by the Chairman of the Mongolian-Tibetan Council, Shi Qingyang, he has now withdrawn his resignation. However, due to funding problems, all political affairs of the Mongolian Political Committee have been virtually at a standstill recently. As for the Mongolian Guidance Director's Office, although the Mongolian people are extremely eager to establish it as soon as possible, Chairman He Yingqin is afraid that he will be unable to take care of it due to his busy official duties, so the official organization is still uncertain. Guo Wang and Bao Yueqing paid another visit to He on the 24th night to urge him. According to Guo Wang, "I and Bao Yueqing came to Ping to pay a visit to He to urge him to take office as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Guidance Director. The report that I have left Ping and returned to Mongolia is inaccurate. It has not yet been determined when and where the Guidance Director's Office will be established. Chairman He Yingqin will not be able to go there in person when the office is established due to his busy military affairs. He will send a councilor of the Military Branch to participate. The results of our visit to He were extremely satisfactory." Also, Bao Yueqing said, "I and Guo Wang have visited Chairman He again. He will decide on the issue of whether or not to take office as the Guidance Director within a few days, and then reply to us. Recently, Prince De has often telegraphed me, urging me to persuade Chairman He to accept this position. We will return to Bailingmiao to report after the matter is completed. He has decided not to go there in person when the office is established."</p>
<p>According to sources concerned, Chairman He is unable to take care of the position of Mongolian Autonomous Guidance Director due to his busy official duties. This is a practical difficulty. However, the Mongolian people are extremely eager for He to take office to appease their longing. As for the location of the Guidance Director's Office, it has not yet been determined whether it will be located in Suiyuan or Bailingmiao, and the time has not been decided.</p>

<p>Farmers Dig Ponds for Drinking Water, Wheat Bran for Food</p>
<p>Old Women Snatching Rice to Beg for Food is Often Heard</p>
<p>Tongxiang, Zhejiang, has not rained since the beginning of this summer, and the weather has been extremely hot, causing a severe drought. The river ports are dry, the land is cracked, and the farmland in the four townships lacks water for irrigation. Most of the crops have withered, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. In particular, the Fuyuan in District 1 and the Tudian in District 4 have higher terrain, and the disaster is more severe. Only 30% of the early rice has been planted, and most of the people who have not sown are catching and transplanting seedlings, but due to lack of water for irrigation, they have all withered. Everywhere is a barren field, and secondary products such as tobacco, hemp, cypress, beans, melons, and fruits are scarce due to dry soil and lack of moisture. The livelihood of farmers has fallen into a state of hardship. Even relatively well-off families have to pawn their belongings to borrow rice, while ordinary poor households have already run out of food and have no way to borrow. They are extremely miserable. Villagers are digging ponds for drinking water and eating wheat bran to satisfy their hunger. The famine is getting worse, and the moans of the hungry are everywhere. In the past month, old women have come to the town to snatch rice to beg for food, which is often heard. The most severe storms are in Tudian, Shiwan, and other places. All the rivers in the town are now dry and the bottom can be seen. The daily drinking water for the citizens has caused panic. They all have to walk six or seven miles to Tanghe (the Grand Canal) to fetch water. The price of water has skyrocketed to several corners per load, which is still not enough. Every drop is precious. Navigation in all places has been stranded, and transportation is inconvenient. The price of rice is rising to about eleven yuan per day, and the people's food is worrying. The autumn heat has been very strong in recent days, and the humidity is uncomfortable. Moreover, due to unclean drinking water, epidemics are prevalent, and several deaths from epidemics are reported every day. The severity of the disaster is truly unparalleled.

<p>The Director of National Tax Collection is Sent to the Province</p>
<p>Ye Zongcheng, the first director of the National Tax Collection in this county, was dismissed from his position by the county government and placed under surveillance for alleged fraud in the collection of grain conversion and extra taxes. It has been almost a month. Local people Wu Boyang, Xu Shiqi, Zhang Huanzhi, and Zhu Zhaosheng, as well as fellow villagers abroad, have telegraphed the provincial government, stating that the national tax is related to the official supply and is of utmost importance. They requested that the provincial government investigate whether there is any inside story. The provincial government sent a commissioner to Songjiang to personally interrogate him. Ye Zongcheng confessed to everything, but the local people believed that there might be other circumstances. Wu Boyang, Wang Jieshi, Zhang Huanzhi, and other eight people went to the province together to visit Director Zhao and requested that he be brought to the province for strict interrogation to clarify the truth. Yesterday, the county government suddenly received a provincial order instructing them to send Ye Zongcheng to the province for verification. County Magistrate Jin sent staff member Wang Bangzhen to escort him to Shanghai in a car hired at 11:00 am on the 31st, and then take the train to the province to be sent to the Finance Department for disposal.</p>

<p>At the Mingli Inn in Yangshu Lane, outside Changmen, on the 29th, a young male and female traveler arrived, dressed in fashionable attire. They booked room number 19. The male was named Wang Yunqing, and the female, Hua Baolin, both aged sixteen. Around 6 PM on the 30th, a tea server saw the female putting a black substance into a hollow pill, which aroused suspicion. He also found a small amount of opium residue in the spittoon. He immediately reported this to the front desk, who then reported it to the relevant police precinct. Police arrived and sent the two to Suyong Hospital for examination. It was confirmed that they had taken poison. The male guest had taken too much poison and died around 9 PM that evening. The female guest had taken less and survived. The District Attorney's Office sent personnel for examination yesterday (31st) morning and ordered the family to prepare for the burial. According to the female guest, she was from Changzhou and had been living in Shanghai since the age of sixteen. She and the deceased, Wang Yunqing, were childhood sweethearts. Her father died when she was three, and she lived with her 35-year-old widowed mother. She had studied in Suzhou for two years and currently resided at No. 109 Daqing Lane, Great Eastern Road, Shanghai, at Mr. Chen Zegao's Shanghai residence. Over the years, she had been cared for by Mr. Chen. Wang Yunqing was a student at Gezhi Middle School in Shanghai. They had known each other for many years. Recently, as Wang grew older, he was attracted to the girl's graceful demeanor and pursued her, seeking a lifelong commitment. The girl refused because Wang's mother ran a brothel in Huile Lane. They had maintained a friendly relationship for two years. The day before, Wang Yunqing invited the girl to Suzhou to relieve his boredom. The girl couldn't bear to refuse and accompanied him. After arriving in Suzhou, Wang again asked the girl to marry him, but she still refused, maintaining only a friendly relationship. They talked all night and did not engage in physical intimacy. On the afternoon of the 30th, Wang, because the girl refused to marry him, took the opium he had brought from Shanghai, put it in a hollow pill, and swallowed it with wine. Seeing Wang taking poison, the girl felt ashamed to face her mother and also took poison, intending to die together. Wang lived at the dentist Jin Jiuru's place on Sanma Road in Shanghai and did not live with his mother. Wang's family arrived in Suzhou yesterday to handle all the arrangements.</p>

<p>Husband Hangs Himself Due to Wife's Affair</p>
<p>Zhao Er'a, a farmer from Lujiazhaiji outside the West Gate of this county, was by nature tyrannical and lecherous. Consequently, he had an affair with Mrs. Zhao, the wife of Chen Shuigen, a neighbor. Over time, the entire village knew about it, and Chen had also heard rumors. However, because of his cowardly nature, he could do nothing about it. Unexpectedly, yesterday, Zhao Er'a first severely beat his own wife and then incited his mistress, Mrs. Zhao, to quarrel with her husband in every way possible, declaring that she would no longer be Chen's wife. After the quarrel, Chen, in a moment of anger, went to a small room and hanged himself. After his family discovered him and cut him down, they tried to save him in every way possible, but it was too late to revive him.</p>

<p>At the home of the widowed Mrs. Zhu Miao, in Bo Du Port, outside the South Gate, around 11 AM the day before yesterday, four unknown men suddenly arrived. After entering, they closed the main gate and claimed they were searching for contraband. They barged into the inner room, overturning boxes and chests, searching extensively. Mrs. Miao assumed they were bandits and dared not make a sound. A neighbor, Mr. Jia, also heard the commotion and quickly reported it to the local watch post, which dispatched police to apprehend them. By the time the police arrived, the four men had already left. Subsequently, one person, Zou Tingliang, was apprehended in the fields behind the Xintai Rice Shop.

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee originally set the deadline for tobacco user registration at the end of August. However, due to procedural delays, the deadline has been extended by one month to the end of September. The County Anti-Smoking Committee in this county has not yet implemented the tobacco user registration and other related matters due to financial constraints. It is said that the internal organization may undergo some changes. As for the various regulations for earth paste (opium) shops, they have been issued by the provincial government to the county, stipulating that three shops will be established in this county. The contractors have also been internally designated. The locations of earth paste shops in various townships and towns have also been determined and will be announced soon, and tobacco user registration will begin.</p>

<p>Rural Schools Effectively Shut Down</p>
<p>The education funds for this county, for the second half of last year, were only released for two and a half terms. From the 21st year to the present, there are as many as eleven terms in arrears. The bureau cannot clear the accounts, and the education sector is struggling to maintain operations. Now that Lu Jingmo has taken over as the director, it is even more impossible to raise funds. The schools have already started one after another, but there is no solution for the education fees, both old arrears and new installments. However, the schools are in great need of funds, so as of now, most rural schools have been unable to hold classes. As a result, some teachers jointly petitioned the bureau the day before yesterday for the release of funds, but to no avail. It is now known that the bureau has borrowed 37,000 yuan from the Jiangsu Farmers' Banks, but it needs the approval of the banks and the issuance of a payment order from the Department of Finance. In reality, it is still difficult, causing the rural education here to effectively shut down.</p>

<p>Cigarette Industry Opposes Increased Taxation</p>
<p>After Zhu Dagu, the newly appointed director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office in Wuyi, took office, cigarette and alcohol merchants believed that the tax increase of five to ten times was difficult to bear and rose up in opposition. Yesterday (30th) at 12 PM, an emergency meeting was held at the Shuonan Guild Hall to discuss countermeasures. The result of the discussion was that the cigarette merchants in this county do not have branch companies or distribution points. What they sell is all wholesale in nature, so-called "whole buying and retail selling". According to the license tax regulations, they should not pay this heavy tax. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and commerce is declining, merchants cannot bear this heavy burden. It was resolved that the original tax payment would be submitted by the Cigarette Industry Association to the County Chamber of Commerce and paid to the Tax Collection Office. At the same time, the Marketing Alcohol and Sauce Guild would jointly file a complaint with the provincial government, the Department of Finance, the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, and the local Party and government authorities, alleging illegal and excessive taxation. The cigarette paper shops in the rural areas also requested the Cigarette Guild to find ways to provide relief.</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having recently read in your newspaper a news item that the central government has approved Jiangsu Province's issuance of 20 million in public bonds to consolidate old debts and use the remaining funds to complete the Huai River Diversion Project, we find this to be inconsistent with the facts. We are providing a detailed list of the various uses for this public bond issuance: (1) 8 million for the construction of new canals; (2) 4 million for disaster relief and work relief in this province; (3) 6 million for Huai River diversion into the sea; (4) 2 million for the redemption of construction public bonds, totaling 20 million.</p>
<p>We are writing to request a correction.</p>

<p>National Federation of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Exemption of Transit Taxes</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China yesterday telegraphed the government authorities, Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance Ministry of Industry Ministry of Transportation Ministry of Railways Nanchang Chairman Jiang Junjian Jian:</p>
<p>We have received a telegram from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce Zheng Ri Dian Wen. We believe that low grain prices hurt farmers, which is a natural phenomenon. If the collection of taxes is slightly relaxed, those who have grain will not rush to sell it, causing prices to fall further and farmers to be harmed. At a time when banditry has not been cleared and military needs are vast, the authorities' multiple tax levies a year are unavoidable. If the people's strength is not exhausted, they should endure the pain and transport it. However, it is like an empty house in nine out of ten cases, as if it has been completely emptied. In this situation, if the bandits are not quelled, the people cannot avoid death, and it is feared that even if the bandits are quelled, the people will die first. We should ask the authorities to use their soldiers and comfort the people in an inevitable situation, taking both sides into consideration, and temporarily postpone the pursuit of calls so that they can wait for prices.</p>
<p>Also, this year, the drought in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces has been severe. Reports say that several hundred thousand stones of foreign rice have been ordered. If Sichuan Province can unite with Hunan and Hubei to exempt all transit rice donations and order Sichuan River vessels to reduce transportation costs and lighten the cost, then the urgently needed rice in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will not have to be sought abroad, and the surplus rice in Sichuan Province can be used to dredge it, and the value will not be difficult to increase. The constant and immutable methods for adjusting the people's food supply are to purchase grain in abundant years and sell grain in lean years. The backward views have not been seen to be chosen. We humbly request your review and decision, and humbly request that you promptly order the two provinces of Sichuan and Hunan to resist foreign rice, on the one hand, and to circulate stored grain, on the other hand, which will benefit both national economy and people's livelihood. We pray that you will grant our request with utmost sincerity.</p>

<p>In this city, after autumn, the drought has been long-lasting, and the heat has been severe, so food prices have soared. The Food Committee has resolved to restrict rice shops from hoarding and raising prices, with the highest price per dan not exceeding 13 yuan and 5 corners, and the price of each bag of flour has also risen by 3 to 4 corners. Since the sudden heavy showers on the 29th and 30th of last month, there has been standing water on the roads, and the weather has turned cooler. The rice markets in southern and northern Shanghai have also seen a pullback. Yesterday, rice prices fell back by two corners or more, and the price of each bag of flour also fell by about one corner. With the cloudy weather, there is a strong tendency for rain to continue, and people's hearts are gradually relaxing. Also, the Saigon rice that has been ordered will continue to arrive in Shanghai, so the price of rice in Shanghai is expected to continue to fall.</p>

Xin Xin News Agency reporters learned from the Jiangsu Bank yesterday that the provincial government has now reduced the amount of the public bond to 20 million, so the original distribution has been changed to (1) 8 million to open up new canals, (2) 6 million to the Huai River into the sea project, (4) 4 million to relieve the drought in various counties south of the Yangtze River, (4) 2 million to recover the Jiangsu Construction Public Bonds. As for repaying old debts, the amount is reduced, and it is not enough to distribute it, so it will be temporarily delayed.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Fund Guarantee <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>When Zhao Dihua, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Department of Finance, contacted the banking community, it was originally intended to use the 1.5 million yuan of salt tax allocated by the Ministry of Finance as a part of the fund. Now that the amount of public bonds has been reduced, the old debts cannot be repaid, so in order to maintain great faith, the salt tax money will be continuously consolidated. As for the fund for the new public bonds, it has now been decided to use the Jiangsu Construction Public Bond fund and the field and house deed tax from 60 counties in the province as a part of the fund. The remaining insufficient amount will be allocated from the field tax or another appropriate guarantee will be raised. It has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>The banking community has stated that the new public bond has been stated to be completely used for construction and disaster relief, and will never be used for administrative expenses. In the future, it will be happy to assist in mortgaging loans to banks to promote its success. However, it is hoped that the use of the public bond must be in accordance with the planned distribution and completely used for construction. At the same time, it must not be forced to purchase from the people of Jiangsu or flow into the market. At the time, a use supervision committee must be organized to strictly supervise and show great faith.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Municipal Budget for the 23rd Year <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Completes Compilation</p>
<p>Education Expenses Increase Annually</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, the municipal budget for the 23rd year has been compiled by the municipal government and submitted to the municipal council for review. It will then be submitted to the central government for record. The following is a conversation with Zhu Fengwei, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Government:</p>
<h3 id="e119">Deficit in Last Year's Final Accounts <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to Zhu, last year's final accounts have been compiled and show a deficit of approximately 840,000 yuan. The reason is that the actual income last year did not reach the budgeted amount. The accumulated deficit over the years is approximately 3.42 million yuan. The deficit will be remedied in the future in various years.</p>
<h3 id="e120">No More Deficits This Year <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>As for this year's budget, all income and expenditure has been accurately estimated. The vehicle and vessel tax and house tax have been approved by the central government to appropriately increase the tax rate, so it is higher than last year's, with a total amount of 10.5 million. All administrative and career expenses of the various organs under the municipal government are distributed within this amount, so there may be no deficits this year.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Increased Education Funding <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Education funding has been stipulated at 1.468 million yuan this year. The funding for each bureau has not increased this year, but education funding has increased annually, which shows that this city attaches great importance to education.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Liu Xiang <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Hopes to Dismiss His Resignation</p>
<p>Liu Electric Detailed Reasons for Resignation</p>
<p>Sichuan People Telegraph the Central Government to Comfort and Retain Him</p>
<p>Deng Mingjie Went to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>According to Far East News Agency, Liu Xiang, Commissioner of Sichuan Rehabilitation and Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, suddenly resigned and left Chengdu some time ago, which has attracted much attention from all parties. Recently, the central authorities have sent repeated telegrams of comfort and retention, and his resignation has been seen to be active. His representative in Shanghai, Deng Mingjie, took the 11 o'clock night express train to Beijing last night to prepare to meet with President Wang and, if necessary, go to Ganzhou to meet with Chairman Jiang to discuss everything. Before leaving, Deng told Far East News Agency reporters that although Commissioner Liu had not yet expressed his intention to continue to be responsible for bandit suppression and military affairs despite the persuasion of the central government, the generals in Sichuan, and various legal groups inside and outside Sichuan, he was still actively arranging for bandit suppression military affairs before the central government approved his resignation, and planned to go to the front line to command in the near future. The bandits are gathering at the junction of Wanyuan and Suixuan counties and are surrounded by the national army. The situation in Sichuan is now stable and has not been affected by Commissioner Liu's resignation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Original Telegram of Presentation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, after Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression and Commissioner of Sichuan Rehabilitation, left Chengdu for Chongqing and telegraphed to the central government to resign from his concurrent posts, letters and telegrams were sent from all sides, earnestly persuading him to stay. Shen Shi News Agency reporters received an airmail letter from a friend in Chongqing yesterday saying that Liu's resignation was expected to be dismissed and that he had decided to depart to the front line to supervise the army and strive to complete the work of bandit suppression. The full text of Liu's telegram of resignation to the central government was also attached, as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of Nanchang, Jian, and secret, Xiang was ordered to suppress the red, and it has been ten months. Thanks to Jun Zuo's virtue, the cities and towns lost in the north road were recovered in order. The bandits are poor and occupy Wanyuan, and have reached the final time of struggle. It is only because the steps of each road are not uniform, which makes the merits of nine rungs a failure. My five-way lone army advanced bravely, recklessly and died to attack strongly, and the losses were huge. At present, the dangerous suppression and control, I understand that there are no other concerns, but how to maintain it in the future is difficult to follow. Xiang Su is foolish and does not Shang Fu Xiao. If there is room for wandering, he will not be wronged to seek perfection. However, for a year, the brain and blood have been twisted, and the mind and strength have been exhausted. The micro-special is not helpful at this time, and the floating words outside the game are measured by the heart of unscrupulousness. If one corner is like this, the overall situation can be known. I expect that Jun Zuo will preside over the overall plan, and his difficulties must be hundreds of times more than Xiang. This is why Xiang wants to say it and stops, and dare not rashly Chen. However, the situation has reached this point, how can he bear to be silent? Although Sichuan is far away, it is very important to the overall situation. If the cotton strength is exhausted, it will be difficult in the coming days. The central government should relieve Xiang of his various positions and choose another capable person to plan his achievements and avoid falling. All the positions of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, Commissioner of Rehabilitation, and Commander of the 21st Army will be temporarily represented by the Chief of Staff from today. I am waiting for disposal, and I am compelled to speak, and I hope to see it.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Sichuan People Retain Him <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to the news from the Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association, the elders of Sichuan, Zeng Jian, because the red force was rampant, and Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, suddenly felt that military affairs were thorny at the critical moment and resigned from his concurrent positions to the central government. The impact was very great, and the corruption was worrying. A special telegram was presented to the central government and the Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association to unanimously retain him, so as to avoid the expansion of the bandit forces and the sinking of Shenzhou, and the upper and lower military and civilians will perish together.</p>

<p>Decide on Cooperation Methods</p>
<p>Jiangsu Focuses on Assisting the Development of Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Farmers Handle Disaster Relief and Other Matters in Rural Areas</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Tian Shitai, Association Director of Jiangsu Bank, said yesterday that the Jiangsu Bank and the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank have decided to cooperate separately on the issues of rural relief and industrial and commercial development after receiving orders from the Department of Finance to cooperate. The following is a record of the various situations:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Decide on Cooperation Methods <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>It is said that since the Jiangsu and Farmers' Banks received the order from the Department of Finance to discuss cooperation methods so that business could be further developed, the main personnel of the two banks held a joint meeting in Zhenjiang some time ago, and Qian agreed that the two banks belong to the province and should do their best to cooperate. It was decided that the Jiangsu Bank will specialize in investing in the development of industry and commerce, and the Jiangsu Farmers' Bank will specialize in handling rural relief matters, such as holding farmer loans, etc., so as to cooperate separately and develop business.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Both Banks' Businesses are Developed <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Treasury has always been managed by Jiangsu Bank, and the county treasury has also been managed by the bank since the 23rd year. The bank's business has been fairly developed in recent years, with 16 branches specializing in various industrial and commercial credit investments. The business of the Farmers' Bank is also not bad, and there are currently 26 branches and offices in various places.</p>

<p>Labor Leaders in Shanghai are Paid by the Company and Sent Back</p>
<p>Those Not in Shanghai Will Try to Contract for a Project</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, more than 100 workers from Hebei traveled from Zhejiang to Anhui some time ago. After passing Dongjiadu Wharf, they were unwilling to move forward and went to the Provincial Shanghai Fellow Association to request relief. The association helped to negotiate with Fuyuan Company to pay their salaries because they belonged to the same hometown. At the same time, they requested the Public Security Bureau to provide relief. There were many misunderstandings during the period. The matter has now been largely resolved. All labor leaders who remain in the fellow association and are in Shanghai will be paid and sent back to their hometowns by the association. Those labor leaders who are not in Shanghai will not be paid for the time being, and the association will try to contract a project with the municipal government to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

<p>River-Sea Intermodal Transport Implemented Today</p>
<p>Intermodal Transport Contract Officially Signed</p>
<p>Six-Month Trial Begins Today</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau and Minsheng Shipping Company have agreed on river-sea intermodal transport in 21 major ports including the Sichuan River, the Yangtze River, the North and South, etc. First, 18 articles of the draft agreement were agreed upon, and then 28 articles of the detailed rules for intermodal transport were added. This information was published in this newspaper long ago. At present, the intermodal transport method has been formulated by both parties. China Merchants Bureau will not add any more river ships above Yichang in addition to the existing sailing ships. Minsheng Company will also not expand the Yihan, Xianghan, and Yangtze River routes. For all upstream cargo transported from the north and south and Shanghai to Sichuan and transferred to Minsheng ships, the bill of lading will be issued by China Merchants. For downstream cargo transported from Yu Yi, regardless of which port it is loaded to and transported by China Merchants ships, the bill of lading will be issued by Minsheng. The minimum bill of lading must be at least five yuan. As for the freight rates of both parties in the intermodal transport, they are also determined by route. Both parties provide convenience in the transportation, storage, and stacking of passenger and cargo within the scope of all routes. The detailed rules for intermodal transport were completed on the 30th of last month and the formal intermodal transport alliance was officially signed yesterday afternoon. From today (September 1), the 21-port cooperative intermodal transport of China Merchants Minsheng River-Sea will take effect. China Merchants Bureau immediately notified the branch offices to comply. As for the implementation period of the contract, it is first set for a six-month trial. If it is effective after the trial period, it will continue to be extended. If you do not want intermodal transport after the expiration, you can also cancel it.</p>

<p>News on Continued Drought Disaster Relief Efforts</p>
<p>According to news from the Hua Yang Relief Association on Renji Road, they have recently received numerous letters and telegrams from various provinces requesting relief for the drought disaster. The disaster situation in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces has been briefly reported in this newspaper before. Now, we will continue to publish excerpts from letters from Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces, selecting the most significant ones: (1) Shangcheng County, Henan: According to the letter, there has been no rain for two months, the fields are cracked, drought-resistant crops have not been planted, and autumn crops have completely withered. It is estimated that the county produces 700,000 shi of rice and 300,000 shi of drought-resistant crops annually. At a price of ten yuan per shi, the income could exceed ten million yuan. Even if there is timely rain now, nine-tenths of the crops have already been damaged. If it is delayed for another ten days, even this remaining one-tenth will be completely lost. There are no grain reserves in the local area, and people's livelihoods are cut off. The future looks bleak and worrying. (2) Hukou County, Jiangxi: This county is located at the mouth of Poyang Lake, on the bank of the Yangtze River, with a small area. In years of good harvest, the grain is only enough to sustain for five months, and the rest is obtained from outside. Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been a severe drought with no rain, and irrigation has been cut off. Beans, cotton, rice, and sorghum have all withered and died. The affected farmland covers 170,000 mu, and the number of disaster-stricken households reaches over 24,000. People are panicked and desperately awaiting food. (3) Pengze County: This county is also a small county in Jiangxi, plagued by floods and droughts for years, and people's livelihoods are already difficult. This summer, there has been no rain for three months, ponds and weirs have dried up, cotton seedlings are short and stunted, and rice seedlings are yellow and scorched. Farmers are at a loss and their livelihoods are cut off. Currently, they can only look up at the empty sky, and innocent people will again suffer disaster. (4) Yuanjiang County, Hunan: Since midsummer, the county has been constantly sunny, resulting in calamities. The water sources have dried up, and there is no way to irrigate. The crops in the large fields have all withered, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. In addition, epidemics are prevalent, and deaths are occurring one after another. If no measures are taken to provide relief, the suffering of the residents is unpredictable. (5) Linxiang County: This county has been plagued by floods and droughts for years, and its vitality has been depleted for a long time. Between spring and summer this year, there was continuous rain, and seedlings were damaged, so three to four tenths could not be planted. After the beginning of summer, the drought demon raged, and there was no rain for a month. Weirs and ponds dried up, and crops turned completely red. There was no way to obtain drinking water. Under these circumstances, farmers have no choice but to stop farming, weep, and await death. (6) Shaoyang County: This county had little rain between spring and summer this year. Recently, the heat has intensified after autumn, and the fields have completely withered. There are no remnants of miscellaneous grains. This area, which has been impoverished by frequent droughts and barrenness, has again suffered this strange disaster. Farmers' livelihoods have reached a dead end. Selling wives and children is often heard of, and people are displaced and wander on the roads. If timely relief is not provided, those who are cunning and fierce will inevitably gather as bandits, which will affect public security and is truly chilling.</p>
<h3 id="e133">National Postal Conference Opens <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Attitude of Postal Workers</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications convened a national postal conference, which opened in Beijing this morning. It is reported that the matters discussed this time are mostly related to postal affairs and the treatment of employees. It is understood that the two national postal workers' associations have sent representatives to Beijing to present their opinions. In the past, the treatment of postal workers was indeed commendable. However, since the recovery of postal rights, the authorities have used various pretexts to make changes, to the point where no further changes can be made. If the authorities do not take into account the pain of the employees, the postal service will inevitably face the risk of collapse. Postal workers across the country are therefore deeply concerned. It is hoped that the communications authorities will take the overall situation into consideration and sincerely adopt the representatives' opinions, so that the situation will not escalate.</p>

<p>Representatives to the Grain Reserve Division Meeting</p>
<p>The case of dividing the accumulated grain and property between Shanghai City and County has not been implemented since it was proposed in the 19th year of the Republic of China.

<p>Telegram from the Cotton Merchants Association to the Yuan, Ministry, and Commission: To the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, National Economic Commission, and Cotton Control Commission: We merchants previously stated that the promulgated regulations for cracking down on cotton are fraught with many obstacles. We intend to earnestly promote inspection first, and then implement the crackdown. We have telegraphed our situation on Yangri and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the matter. According to Article 14 of the crackdown regulations, the date of implementation of these regulations shall be determined by order. It is clear that it cannot take effect before it is announced. However, the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Federation published a notice yesterday, implementing all the provisions of the regulations from September 1. This kind of illegal act cannot be recognized by us merchants. However, as the new cotton is about to be launched on the market, if no measures are taken to stop it, it will have a significant impact on market transactions. If disputes arise as a result, it will endanger the national cotton industry. In addition to immediately publishing a denial in the newspaper, we hereby telegraph the situation to your Yuan, Ministry, and Commission, requesting you to order a clear prohibition. On the one hand, the Ministry of Industry should promote inspection in advance, so as to improve it in an orderly manner and ensure the livelihood of the industry. At the end of the telegram, we await your urgent orders, The Shanghai Cotton Merchants Association, all merchants. Yan.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Red Pill King <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Shengfa Handed Over to the Public Security Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>Because This Case Is of Great Importance</p>
<p>Further Investigation Is Still Necessary</p>
<p>Zhou Shengfa, a native of Yuyao, known as the Red Pill King, recently raised huge funds to manufacture large-scale Hong Wan machines under the Flying Horse brand. He secretly transported them to other ports for sale, with distribution points in various ports, making huge profits. Countless people have been harmed. Up to now, it is said that Zhou owns more than one million gold dollars in ill-gotten gains, including movable and immovable property. This spring, 2.4 million red pills, worth more than 200,000 gold dollars, were seized at the North Railway Station. The criminals Zhao Zuting and Wang Weicheng (aka Little Wang), as well as three police officers who sheltered the red pills, were arrested and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation and executed by firing squad. According to Wang Weicheng's confession, the main culprit, Zhou Shengfa, has been wanted in Shanghai. Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau has paid special attention to this case and secretly ordered Captain Lu of the Criminal Investigation Team to select squad leader Ling Tianpeng to lead detectives to investigate and arrest him. After receiving the order, squad leader Ling remained calm and conducted a secret investigation. Later, he discovered that the suspect Zhou was hiding in house number 20, lane 707, Yuanyuanli, Gordon Road. He disguised himself and, together with Chinese and Western detectives, spent 57 days to capture Zhou Shengfa, the main culprit in the red pill poisoning case. He was handed over to the First Special District Court and transferred to the Nanshi District Court. The duty prosecutor, Lei Binzhang, proposed a trial and ordered him to be detained pending further instructions. This was reported in previous newspapers. Now it is learned that at 11 a.m. yesterday, Director Wen Hongen of the Public Security Bureau prepared a document and ordered squad leader Ling Tianpeng, detectives Zhang Zhenhai, Xu Changbiao, Lü Zhenliao, Gui Guofang, Yuan Shanlin, and others, who handled this case, to submit a request to the local court to transfer the suspect Zhou Shengfa back to the bureau for interrogation. Judge Zhang Zi presented it to President Shen Xiqing and Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying for approval. A preliminary hearing was opened, and Zhou Shengfa, who was in custody, was brought to the court. After a brief interrogation, the court ordered the officers to take him back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It was found that the suspect Zhou was wearing a white short shirt and trousers, with a burly figure, exceptionally strong, full of smiles, and a calm demeanor. When the suspect was taken down from the court, he had a bag, but because his hands were handcuffed, it was inconvenient for him to carry it, so a detective carried it for him. Zhou repeatedly thanked him and strode out of the court, boarding a car (the Public Security Bureau's prisoner transport vehicle) awaiting instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Hotel Industry Asks the Public Works Department <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>to Explain the Reason for the Tax Increase</p>
<p>Because the Tax Increase Points Published are Very Doubtful</p>
<p>The Tax Office Replied that a Reassessment Can Be Requested</p>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the problem of the Public Works Department's increase in the hotel industry's room tax has not been resolved for two months. This time, the hotel industry has many doubts about the reasons for the tax increase sent by the Public Works Department. Now, a letter has been sent to the office to ask for an explanation. The reporter of Xinxin News Agency is now looking for and recording the correspondence between the hotel industry and the Tax Office, which is divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e152">Asking for an Explanation <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, at 10 a.m. on the 22nd of this month, the association sent representatives Sun Qiuping and others to meet with you to state the public opinion regarding your office's increase in room tax. I am grateful for your director's audience and for publishing the reasons for the tax increase. According to the reports of the representatives, there are many doubts about the points published by your director. Now I would like to list them as follows, hoping that you will reply so that I can tell the industry members: (1) Room tax is based on rent, which is the unchanging rule of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the amount of rent is based on contracts or rent receipts and old-fashioned vouchers, which is also the unchanging practice of the Public Works Department. Now your office uses the price of the room to estimate the tax, and the hotel industry uses the house and time as a commodity, and collects room tax, and uses the commodity to estimate, which is equivalent to using the commodity price as the standard for tax collection, which is a change of the original rules of the Public Works Department, which should be explained first. (2) The hotels that have been taxed this time are all considered by your director to be too cheap after the houses were built, so they must be re-evaluated now. The buildings of the hotels that have been taxed were all built four or five years or eight or nine years ago, when the land prices, material prices, and rents were all at the highest level. When the construction was completed, the Public Works Department had already admitted that the rents of both parties were in line with the valuation of the Public Works Department. Now, material prices are falling, and land and housing market prices are all affected. On the contrary, it is said that the estimates are too low, which should be explained second. (3) The hotels that have been taxed all have lease contracts to prove, but your director said that the lease period is very long, and there is no such thing as a long lease of 25 years, and there is no forgery in this. Before operating a hotel, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the landlord on the lease term, and the two parties sign a contract before starting business. The capital of a wild hotel is mostly in the decoration and property, if the landlord does not agree to the lease term, the entire property will be thrown into waste once the term is demolished. Anyone who knows a little about the hotel industry can say it. Furthermore, in long-term leases, the landlord and tenant have different views on whether the rent will rise or fall in the future. As a result, the initial rent will be higher than the normal rent, the middle period will be straight, and the end period will be lower. Anyone who is familiar with economic principles and social conditions can know it. As for whether it is forged, there should be proof, how can it be assumed? This should be explained third. Please explain the above three points immediately, and I will be very grateful. Sincerely to Mr. Bao En, Deputy Director of the Tax Office of the Public Works Department,</p>
<h3 id="e153">Reassessment <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>In reply, I received your letter on August 28, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the assessment of tax payment. I think that if you want to reassess, you may as well ask the Public Works Department's Tax Assessment Committee for it. The committee has a fair assessment of whether the price assessed by our office is fair. The application should be obtained from our office in person. Because of the previous letter, I hereby reply, hoping that you will check it. Sincerely to the Hotel Industry Association, Bao En,</p>

<p>Yuanzhao Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>Monks and Taoists Who Return to Secular Life Must Not Take Temple Property</p>
<p>Yuanzhao's Arrest Uncovered Many Deeds</p>
<p>Xing Cen, the current abbot of the famous ancient Longhua Temple in West Shanghai, recently filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Shanghai District Court against Yuanzhao, the former abbot, for embezzling temple property. The court has held several trials without a conclusion. Now, the Ministry of Interior has issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments that monks and Taoists who return to secular life must not take temple property, which has been published in newspapers. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau has found that Yuanzhao, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, has left the temple and taken away the temple property deeds. He is now hiding in the French Concession, at large. Therefore, it prepared a document and sent detectives to the Second Special District Court yesterday morning to request the court to send police to assist in the arrest and interrogation, etc. President Wang of the Second Special Court approved the request and immediately sent bailiff Dou Wenjin to go to the vicinity of Caishi Road with the detectives to arrest the monk Yuanzhao and haul out a small leather suitcase. The contents were all real estate or housing deeds. The court immediately sent it to the First Tribunal for a hearing by judge Zhang Chaozuo. According to the Public Security Bureau's request, the court approved the transfer of the defendant Yuanzhao back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The official ordered the defendant to be handed over to the officers from the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The monk, who is about 40 years old and a native of Fenghua, Zhejiang,</p>
<h3 id="e160">Verdict in the One-Consort Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Xie Peide and Hong Chengde Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>Part of the Hong Case Adjourned for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Xie Peide, business manager of Shanghai Cement Company, and Hong Chengde, a wealthy merchant, along with Hong's concubine, were recently sued by Madam Chen Wang, represented by lawyers Yen Yeh and Fu-Kang, for the murder of her daughter Chen Zhujun (also known as One-Consort Lao Liu). The Special Court has summoned them several times, but due to Hong Chengde's absence, the hearings have been repeatedly postponed, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, Judge Wu Zehan opened the second criminal court for questioning. Hong Chengde also surrendered himself. According to Hong's statement, on April 26th, Xie Peide called him and his concubine to Chen Zhujun's residence. Chen and Hong's concubine were friends. At the time, Chen wanted to move to Hong's house because she could no longer stay where she was, so they took Xie's car to Hong's place. That day, Chen made a phone call to Yang Binghu, saying that she was now at the Hong's residence and that they could discuss matters there. On the 28th, Yang and others came to Hong's house. Yang Binghu first apologized to Xie, then asked to speak with Chen in the bathroom privately. Chen then went into the bathroom with him. Less than ten minutes later, four gunshots were heard, and both of them were found dead in the bathroom. Subsequently, Ji Binkui, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, testified that on April 28th, after receiving a report, he went with Western detective Cai Naitai to investigate. At the time, he saw Yang Binghu dead next to the bathroom door. There was a letter placed by the washbasin. He then saw a black jewelry box on the bed in the bedroom. Xie Peide was carrying it to another room. When he asked Xie whose it was, Xie replied that it was jewelry he had given to Chen Zhujun before. He then intervened, saying that since it had already been given as a gift, it belonged to her and could not be moved. After a brief inspection, he saw that the box was full of valuable jewelry such as diamond rings, bracelets, and diamond pendants, about twenty pieces in total, and a bank passbook in Chen Zhujun's name with a balance of one thousand yuan. He could not remember the name of the bank. There was also a divorce agreement, which Xie said he had given to Chen. The incident took place at the Sun Apartment, No. 561 Weihaiwei Road, which was under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, so the Western detective telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and Chinese detective He Yunpu and Western detective Hua Sheng came. He then handed the jewelry box to detective He, and at that time, the divorce agreement had been hidden by Xie in his suit pocket. Subsequently, Western detective Cai Naitai testified, confirming that he had seen a black jewelry box, but only knew it contained jewelry and did not inspect the number of items. The rest of his testimony was similar to that of detective Ji. Yang Qiusun then testified about the circumstances at the time and presented a suicide note, which Yang Binghu had placed on the washbasin in the bathroom before his death. Lawyer Yen Yeh then asked Yang Qiusun if he had brought the threatening letter he had received. Yang replied that he had given it to the prosecutor during the autopsy. Lawyer Yen then asked him to announce the contents. Yang said that the letter generally said something like, "You have no son, only this one grandson. Now Yang Binghu is taking Xie Peide's love, and if you do not advise him, there will be harm to the grandfather and grandson." After hearing this, the court, with the facts clear, ordered the start of the debate. After the lawyers on both sides debated, Judge Wu declared the debate concluded and delivered the verdict in court. The main text of the verdict stated that Xie Peide and Hong Chengde were not guilty. The plaintiff's civil suit was dismissed. Part of the Hong case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Are Quite Fortunate After All</p>
<p>The Value of Shark Fin Imports for the First Seven Months of This Year</p>
<p>Exceeds 1,791,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The import of foreign consumer goods is increasing day by day and month by month, and it is not decreasing due to the economic downturn, which is enough to attract attention. A reporter from the Datong News Agency learned from the International Trade Bureau yesterday morning that the value of shark fin imports, used by the upper and middle classes to entertain guests, was 898,072 gold units for the first seven months of this year, equivalent to 1,791,653 yuan in national currency, which is a significant increase compared to the same period last year, when it was only 1,280,738 yuan, so it has increased by more than 500,000 yuan. In July alone, it was 108,555 gold units, equivalent to 216,567 yuan in national currency, most of which was consumed in this city. From this, it can be seen how extravagant Shanghai residents are.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Mayor Wu's Rectification <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Time Limit for Applying for Land Measurement and Certificate Renewal</p>
<p>Three Months from Measurement to Signature of the Drawing</p>
<p>Mayor Wu of this city believes that the land occupancy certificate is the only proof of land ownership for the people. To facilitate the people, he recently ordered the Land Bureau to report the time limit for applying for land measurement and certificate renewal to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government ordered the Land Bureau to set a time limit of three months from the dispatch of personnel for measurement to the signature of the drawing by the owner, and three months from the endorsement of the guarantor to the drawing and issuance of the certificate, except for cases where disputes arise. In total, six months is the maximum limit. Ordinary cases can be appropriately shortened, but not to less than three months, to show seriousness. In addition, three points are supplemented, and the Land Bureau is still ordered to properly draft improvement measures and submit them for approval. The three supplementary points are as follows: (1) For all land measurement and certificate renewal cases, before the scheduled measurement, the land guarantor should be ordered to report the four neighbors of the land, so that the neighbors can be notified at the same time to avoid disputes after the event. (2) If there are property disputes such as encroachment or unclear boundaries in the land to be measured, the Land Bureau should immediately stop the process or return the original documents to maintain the original state and have the court handle it. It should not be disposed of rashly. After the judgment is finalized, the process should be resumed. If there are cases such as applying for land measurement and transfer of contract due to incomplete evidence or other disputes, the original documents can also be returned to clarify responsibilities. (3) For the people's application for land measurement and certificate renewal, the Land Bureau has always only dispatched a surveyor from the Third Section for measurement, and the personnel in charge of the section do not participate. Relying only on the surveyor's report, and often scheduling measurements repeatedly, but failing to implement the measurement for years, is prone to corruption. The Land Bureau should find ways to change this and pay attention to it at any time to improve efficiency. As for the owner's deliberate evasion or self-delay, which causes the suspension and exceeds the time limit, the responsibility lies with the owner and not with the government, so there is no reason to criticize. The original procedure and time limit proposed by the Land Bureau are excerpted below. For the sake of speed, appropriate changes are made. When an owner applies for land measurement, he only needs to collect the property evidence, send it to the Fourth Section of the Bureau to issue a receipt, check the single grain tax, and order the payment of measurement fees at the same time, and schedule the measurement. The length of the measurement period depends on the number of cases and is arranged in order. That is, after the measurement date is scheduled, it may be delayed due to rain, the owner's absence, the debtor's avoidance of the field, or temporary disputes, resulting in postponement and rescheduling. After the surveyor completes the measurement, it must be processed, the measurement records must be sorted out, detailed drawings must be made, and the boundaries, area, drawings, examination, photography, review, drawing, and other procedures must be calculated. Moreover, these procedures are all interconnected and have their own difficulties. Therefore, if the land is free from encroachment disputes or other unclear procedures, it is estimated that the owner can be ordered to sign the drawings within three months. (The procedure is often interrupted at this point. If the owner receives the drawings and does not sign and send them immediately, or claims that the drawings are wrong and requests correction, it is often after a long time that they accuse the Bureau of being slow to process and make false accusations. This situation is not uncommon. If there is excess land, the Tax Section must be notified, but most owners often ignore the Bureau's notification of the Tax Section. The Tax Section's problem is not resolved, so the certificate cannot be made, which also causes delays.) After the drawings are signed and sent to the Bureau, the land guarantor is ordered to endorse them. (If the land guarantor is delayed in arriving, the Bureau will formulate other processing methods.) Within one and a half months after the endorsement, a topographic map of the household land will be drawn, and within one month, the land occupancy certificate will be filled out and sent. Within half a month after the certificate is made, the seal will be affixed and sealed, and various procedures such as affixing the hard seal and proofreading will be completed. In summary, the processing of land measurement cases takes three months from the completion of the measurement to ordering the signature of the drawings, and three months from the submission of the signed drawings to the issuance of the certificate. However, if there are disputes in the middle, it is difficult to predict the processing time limit. The reason why the various procedures after signing and submitting the drawings take three months is that the original intention of setting the time limit was to allow for a certain amount of time to be processed in order due to the increased workload, and to allow the neighboring households of the land to be measured an opportunity to object in order to be cautious and prevent problems. Now, it is planned to maintain this point and not change it.</p>

<p>Woman Beaten and Miscarries, Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Yu Zhang Causes a Major Disaster Out of Nothing</p>
<p>Xu Chen Injured and Miscarries, Dies in Vain</p>
<p>Xu Chen, a woman from Yangzhou, was 24 years old and lived at No. 237 Hong'an Lane, Haining Road. Her husband, Xu Wanyuan, was a cook with a meager income, so their finances were not very comfortable. They owed the sub-landlord Zhou Hongxu eight yuan in rent. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of last month, Yu Zhang, a woman living in the same house, suddenly falsely told Xu Chen that if she did not pay the rent, Zhou would evict them. Upon hearing this, Ms. Xu became suspicious and asked Zhou's younger sister, Yuezhi, for clarification, only to find out that it was not true. Therefore, at 1:00 PM that day, the two women quarreled with each other, and then engaged in a physical altercation. People intervened to stop them. However, Xu Chen was six months pregnant, and after being beaten, she felt excruciating abdominal pain. By 6:00 AM the next morning, the abdominal pain worsened, and she suddenly began to bleed. Her husband was extremely alarmed and rushed her to the Shanghai Nursing Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 0:16 AM yesterday morning. The hospital reported this to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detective Jin Guanya to investigate. However, Yu Zhang had already fled without a trace several days earlier. The detective then transported the body to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. At around 10:00 AM, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the scene to examine the body. According to the briefing by the Western police chief, and then according to Zhou Hongxu's statement, Zhou Hongxu, age 21, from Ningbo, who is a cook, is the sub-landlord of the house. The deceased lived on the third floor, and Yu Zhang lived in the pavilion room. On the day of the fight, he was out working, so he did not witness it. However, according to his sister, they had kicked each other. After his sister and neighbors intervened, they stopped. The deceased then felt abdominal pain. According to the deceased's husband, Xu Wanyuan, age 29, he owed the sub-landlord eight yuan in rent. Yu Zhang, who lived in the same house, suddenly told his wife that if they did not pay the sub-landlord, he would evict them. After questioning the sub-landlord's younger sister, they said that it was not true, so they knew that Yu was lying. At around 1:00 PM that day, he had gone out to work, and the two women suddenly quarreled with each other. When he returned home, his wife told him, and she said that she had been experiencing severe abdominal pain since then, and the next morning she miscarried. He then sent her to the hospital. Guo, upon receiving the statement, believed that Yu Zhang was indeed suspected of committing a crime and ordered the police station to strictly arrest her for investigation. He then ruled that the deceased, Xu Chen, female, died due to miscarriage. The body was handed over to her husband, Xu Wanyuan, to collect and bury.</p>

<p>Organizes a Qiantang River Tide Watching Tour</p>
<p>As autumn arrives, the tides of Zhejiang will once again surge towards the sky. Chinese and Western visitors are flocking to the roads, all eager to witness the spectacular tides. Haining and Bapu are both excellent places to watch the tides, but Bapu is especially so. Bapu is located twenty miles east, where the riverbank juts out, and the surging tides rush in, encountering a sudden impact. One wave is blocked, while the other is not, meeting at Bapu, causing the tides to surge and crash like ten thousand galloping horses. It is truly a spectacle. The tides then turn into a curved line and rush towards Haining, so the high tides at Haining are only the rebound of the aftershocks from Bapu. Based on its experience, the China Travel Service in this city has scheduled special Bapu tide-watching tours on September 25th and 26th, limited to eighty people each day. Departures from Shanghai will be by special bus, with round-trip tickets costing ten yuan per person, including a lunch box meal. If traveling in groups of four, the bus can be dispatched to pick you up at your residence. Detailed regulations are available for review. Since this trip reaches Bapu via the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway, the scenery along the way is beautiful, and driving and sightseeing is even more enjoyable. Ladies and gentlemen who wish to watch the tides should book and purchase tickets as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Hai Ning Tidal News <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Qiantang River tide, commonly thought to be at its peak in mid-August, actually sees large tides almost every day after autumn begins. When strong winds blow, it becomes even more spectacular. This year, the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway authorities determined the largest tides would occur on August 27th, 28th, 29th, September 11th, 12th, 26th, 27th, and the 6th, and therefore, special round-trip tickets and bus tickets were sold for tide watching on these days. Passengers could take the train from Shanghai to Chang'an Station, transfer to a bus, and go directly to the Hai Ning riverside. The railway bureau built a tide-watching platform, allowing visitors to enter and take a seat with their tickets. August 27th was the first day the railway bureau sold tide-watching tickets. It was reported that Liu Dingxin, the deputy director of the railway bureau's traffic department, along with staff from various departments, went to inspect the arrangements. At that time, there were nearly a hundred visitors. The train left North Station at 7:55 AM and arrived at Chang'an Station after 11:00 AM. Many chartered long-distance buses were already waiting at the station, carrying the tourists directly to the banks of the Hai Ning River. They arrived at the destination in about half an hour. At that time, the tide had not yet arrived. The tourists strolled along the riverbank before entering the tide-watching platform. After about fifteen minutes, a line of white waves could be seen rising from the mouth of Hangzhou Bay, gradually extending. The sound of the tide rumbled like the sudden unfolding of spring thunder, shaking the distant sky. The white line grew longer and higher, and the rumble became deafening. When the white line connected in all directions and pushed forward, the raging waves surged, like ten thousand horses galloping. The viewers held their breath. The tide head was about seven feet high, rolling forward. Starting from 12:50 PM, the tide reached the Hai Ning riverside at 1:20 PM. The low-lying dikes along the coast were instantly submerged, and the remaining waves surged, still threatening to sweep ashore. It is said that yesterday the weather was hot. If it had been cloudy, rainy, or windy, the tide would have been even higher. The railway bureau's tide-watching platform was located to the right of the tide-watching pavilion on the riverbank, with comfortable facilities and drinks available for purchase. It was also reported that the railway bureau had arranged for a restaurant to prepare meals for the visitors to eat by the river. After the tide watching was completed that day, the tourists took buses back to Chang'an and boarded the 3:07 PM express train back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Tobacco Exchange Industry Association <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Request to Reduce License Tax</p>
<p>Notice to Members to Submit Reasons Individually</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has been responsible for collecting the city's tobacco and alcohol license tax for two months. Director Cai's intention is to align with the regulations of the Ministry and rectify and collect the tax fairly. However, tobacco and alcohol merchants claim that "rectification" is simply a euphemism for raising taxes, which has already been implemented with increases ranging from one to several times. The fact that taxes have been increased is already evident, leading to widespread resentment. After the industry petitioned, they were met with understanding, and many were still charged the original amount of two or four yuan. However, the investigation by the tax collection office, due to a lack of understanding of the industry's intricacies, resulted in many unjust increases. According to the person in charge of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, many small shops with limited capital find it difficult to make a profit due to the small scale of their business and are unable to bear the increased tax burden. They have asked the association for help. The association has already selectively returned taxes to those who have applied, and for those who have been asked to pay more but have not yet done so, they request that the taxes be waived to show compassion and maintain livelihoods. Based on this, the association petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on August 29th to discuss relief measures. Members have already been notified to submit their reasons in writing from August 30th to September 5th, so that a roster can be compiled and sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to implore the authorities to handle the case together and request correction and reduction. It is reported that after the association issued the notice, several businesses, including Datianxiang on Tianbao Road, Lu Jintai on Ninghe Road, Baoyu on Dongjiadu, and Eryuanxing and Chen Ji on Houjia Road, have already registered. The association's notice is recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice regarding the petition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 29th of this month, with the following measures: (1) The autumn license tax donated by fellow businesses has increased from two yuan to four, eight, twelve, or twenty yuan. Various members have sent letters stating that their business is small-scale and profit margins are thin, making it difficult to earn a profit. Donating one yuan to maintain a livelihood is already challenging. How can they bear a multiple increase in taxes? A reduction or exemption is requested. (2) For households that have been subject to increased taxes, a roster has already been submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to argue the case with the authorities. For households that have not yet been investigated, they should first inquire with the Municipal South Tax Collection Office to determine if the tax will be increased. If they are able to bear the increase, there is no need to argue. For those who are unable to bear the burden, please submit a written explanation of the reasons to this association within one week so that a supplementary roster can be compiled and sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Finance Bureau, requesting compassionate reduction. (3) If the authorities are unable to understand the situation, they will only be able to act in accordance with the resolutions of the joint meeting of tobacco and alcohol industry representatives. (Please pay attention to the above three items.) Members are requested to submit their reasons for being unable to bear the burden to this association from August 30th to September 5th, so that it can be reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to implore the authorities to grant a reduction. Please do not delay and cause harm. This notice is issued.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Publication of the Northeast News Compilation <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai Northeast News Agency has been established for less than two years since last year, the comrades in the agency have the grand aspirations of striving to save the country and recover lost territory. Therefore, they collect materials at any time to convey news from the Northeast, expose the inhumanity of the Japanese invaders, and the ridiculous and boring measures of the puppets, and send them to major newspapers and periodicals in Shanghai for publication, which has been quite successful. Now, in order to leave indelible traces of reality, record the impressions of painful reflection, and widely promote the cause, the agency has decided to issue the Northeast News Compilation once every four months. It is now learned that its inaugural issue has been published, totaling 300,000 words, revealing the recent four months of the Japanese invaders' invasion of Northeast China in terms of military, economic, political, cultural, transportation, and other realities, so that the people of the country can be stirred to action after reading it, and prepare for the recovery of the soil and the shame of snow. Among them, the most valuable texts are the Overview of Field Surveys in the Northeast, the Cries of Blood and Tears from the Northeast Compatriots in Distress to the Motherland, and the Northeast Inspection Record, all of which are materials obtained at the risk of patriotic people and special reporters dispatched by the agency. Reading them makes people hate the enemy and feel hair-raisingly angry. The preface has inscriptions by General Li Du, a famous anti-Japanese general, and Mr. Shi Liangcai, a giant in the newspaper industry. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, Chen Lifu, a key figure in the party and state, and other celebrities have also written inscriptions. In addition, there are also many photos of the puppet state, which are published in special copperplate editions, which are quite rare. In short, the publication is rich in content and important in news. All compatriots who care about the Northeast should have a copy to strengthen their determination to endure hardship and prepare for revenge. It is reported that the book is sold by the Shanghai Huatong Bookstore on behalf of the agency.</p>

<p>Western Detective Agency Plans to Arrest Red Pill Traffickers</p>
<p>Wang Shousong, a Criminal in Distribution, Was Apprehended</p>
<p>Tracking Down the Leader Zou Agou</p>
<p>Drug King Zou Agou (from Suzhou) specializes in selling red pills and white powder (i.e., morphine and heroin contained in cigarette butts) and other drugs in the area of Ruifuli on Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. He has dispatched dozens of accomplices (divided into day and night shifts) to trade in the streets and alleys, with very meticulous sales procedures. There are always more than 20 people on standby as lookouts, cashiers, token distributors, and goods distributors, patrolling the area. The mechanism for hiding the goods is very secret, even insiders do not know. The wholesale depot is located at No. 66 Ruifuli, but there are no drugs in the house, so although the police have heard of it, it is not easy to crack the case. Yesterday (i.e., the 31st) at 10:00 AM, the Western detective of the French Concession specializing in drug investigation led the Chinese detectives of the same team and drove in a truck to rush into No. 66 to search for and arrest the criminals. However, these people escaped through the back door in full force without any gains. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Western detective secretly went to ambush with only two Chinese detectives, and finally apprehended Wang Shousong, a key criminal in distribution, with dozens of packets of red pills, morphine, heroin, and other drugs found on him. The rest escaped. He was taken into the police station along with the loot, and is currently tracking down the leader, drug king Zou Agou, to investigate and punish him according to the law in order to stop the drug scourge.</p>

<p>Zheng Shifan's Sentence Reduced to Nine Years</p>
<p>Zhang Ashu's Appeal Was Rejected</p>
<p>Four years ago, Pu Wenjiang, the manager of Fuxin Flour Factory from Wuxi, and Qian Zhaofu, a local resident who runs the Yongfeng Wood Company in Nanshi, Shanghai, were kidnapped one after another in the French Concession. In the autumn of the year before last, the Chinese and Western detectives of the special organ of the French police arrested the gang of local criminals Zheng Shifan, Zhang Afu, and Zhang Jiancheng from Ningbo, and sent them to the Second Special Court. Zheng was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the two Zhangs were each sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. Zhang Jiancheng was sentenced to death by the First Special Court for committing a kidnapping case in the Public Concession, and was executed. Later, Zheng and Zhang Afu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, Zheng Shifan's sentence was changed to 12 years of imprisonment, and Zhang Afu's sentence was changed to life imprisonment. The two criminals still refused to accept and filed a third instance appeal with the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file, it found that there were still doubts in the case, revoked the original judgment, and sent the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for trial. The Third Branch of the High Court had investigated the witnesses and concluded the collegial panel trial, and announced that the judgment was awaiting a fixed date. The matter has been recorded in the newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the judgment. At 9:00 AM, Guo Dezhang, the chief of the criminal court, together with the two judges Sun and Fan and the prosecutor Zhang, specially opened the Third Criminal Court and ordered the two criminals Zheng and Zhang to be brought to court. The judgment revoked the part of the original judgment concerning Zheng Shifan's crime and punishment. Zheng Shifan was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment for assisting in kidnapping for ransom.

<p>Suspect Ren Haoming Not Guilty</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin from Changzhou served as a detective in the local Public Security Bureau. After resigning, he came to Shanghai and was hired by Shenxin No. 9 Yarn Factory in Yangshupu as an inspector. At 6:45 AM on August 20th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, he was shot and knocked down by an enemy near the factory, attempting to harm his life. He was later sent to the hospital for treatment and recovered. In June of the following year, he was assassinated for the second time in the same way, shot and killed. Shen Yuzhou, the head of the Chinese detectives of Yangshupu Police Station, arrested the criminals Fang Renzhao, Wu Fafang, and Tang Bingchang and sent them to the First Special District Court. As a result, Fang and Wu were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Tang was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. It was found that an accomplice, Ren Haoming from Changzhou, was at large. He was recently arrested by detectives from the Putuo Road Police Station and sent to the court for interrogation. Because the location of the incident and the finalized criminals were handled by the Yangshupu Police Station, the police station still interrogated and supplied the details, which have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has been concluded and is awaiting judgment. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan went to the Third Criminal Court to announce the judgment that Ren Haoming was not guilty. The testimony of the family members of the victim in this case was contradictory and lacked sufficient evidence. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, requested that he be returned to custody during the appeal period, which was approved by the court.</p>

<p>Female Worker Committed Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Gong Xu, a woman from Jiangbei living at No. 53, Garbage Pond, North of Yangjiadu, Pudong, has a daughter named Genmei, 19 years old, who has been betrothed to someone but has not yet married. She is currently a female worker at the nearby Yingchang Match Factory. The mother and daughter have always been harmonious. After dinner at 8:00 PM the night before, they talked about the family's life. The mother was very anxious because her income could not cover her expenses, and she blamed Genmei for only making 27 or 28 chips per shift, saying that the wages she turned in were too low to make a living. Genmei was angry and frustrated because it was due to the slow work and not her lack of productivity. The old mother should not have blamed her too much. She pretended to go to Puxi with her sisters to watch a play. At night, she went to the riverbank and committed suicide by drowning, unbeknownst to her mother. Because no one noticed, she sacrificed her life. Her body floated to the surface of the Huangpu River at the Jinheyuan Wharf in the 16th Pu at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Two Chinese detectives, No. 15 and No. 93, of the Customs Water Patrol Police Station happened to see it and fished it out of the police station. While waiting for the Lifeboat Bureau to take it away for burial, the deceased's mother suddenly cried to the police station, claiming that she had not seen her daughter return all night and suspected that something had happened. Later, she heard a boatman report that she had died tragically in the river and requested that the body be claimed. The police station approved it.</p>

According to the husband Feng Dalang's statement, he is from Chongming and lives nearby, making a living by pushing a small cart. His wife Feng Wang is 43 years old.

<p>Fei Zibin's Medical Achievements</p>
<p>Dr. Fei Zibin of Menghe has cured many serious diseases at home and abroad and is famous overseas. Recently, his secret ancestral medicine for malaria and dysentery has been popular all over the country. A neighbor of Mr. Wu Zhihui suffered from malignant dysentery and could not be cured by many medicines. Wu gave him Fei's malaria and dysentery relief, and he recovered after one dose. Afterwards, Wu often praised Fei's quick treatment and the miraculous effects of Chinese medicine in crowded places, intending to cultivate social wealth and plug the huge loopholes in the import of Western medicine. In addition, Layman Ding Fubao also often used this medicine to treat the poor and sick. According to reports, those suffering from malaria or dysentery recovered completely after one dose. Ding called Fei's medicine the most valuable medicine in the world. As for the lung tuberculosis pills he produced, the hemoptysis of Liu Chaowang, the former governor of Sichuan, and the labor cough of Meng Jiguang of the British American Tobacco Company were all cured by this pill.</p>

<p>To the Editor: According to our client, Bei Shunrong, the report "Woman Injured in Stall Dispute" published in the newspaper on the 28th of this month contains inaccuracies. Ling A'da previously operated meat stall No. 63 in the Pingliang Road vegetable market. Upon A'da's death, and after failing to renew the license for three months, the Municipal Council's health department revoked the license, reclaimed the stall, and granted it to Shunrong for business. However, Zhu, the wife of Ling A'da, became enraged upon seeing Shunrong operating the stall and fabricated a story claiming that she entrusted Shunrong to manage the stall during her husband's illness, and that Shunrong then changed the name of Ling A'da without authorization. This is a complete fabrication and an attempt to mislead the public. Furthermore, she has repeatedly harassed him and intentionally cut her left arm with a knife in an attempt to frame him. There are witnesses to this. Instead of repenting, she further fabricates stories and publishes them in the newspaper, and attempts to use malicious influence to pressure the Municipal Council to revoke its decision and reinstate the old arrangement. Her methods are despicable. In addition to initiating criminal proceedings, we request that you publish this letter in your "Letters to the Editor" column to set the record straight. Accordingly, we respectfully request your consideration. Sincerely, Gu Jirong, Lawyer, addressed to the Shenbao Newspaper.</p>

<p>The Issue of Women's Self-Study After Marriage</p>
<p>| Reply to Liu Xunyue |</p>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Several years ago, I read Ni Huanzhi, written by Ye Shaojun. In the book, Ni Huanzhi's wife was initially a very promising teacher, but after marriage, she forgot her responsibilities and became a good wife and loving mother. Although the author eventually opened up a path for her, the change was abrupt. Why do women forget their responsibilities after marriage? How can we make her understand her responsibilities again and rescue her from the sea of suffering | which she considers happiness |?</p>
<p>Women, almost every woman buries her future after marriage. Their only hope is to raise children and carry on the family line. Their only duty is to serve their husbands, and they don't care about anything else. They never want to improve themselves again. This is not an exaggeration; I have seen many examples with my own eyes. I have a friend whose wife, as far as I know, was a smart and ambitious woman before marriage. But after marriage, when my friend gave her elementary social science books to read, she looked contentedly at the child beside her and smiled, "Why do we need to read these?" She sometimes reads novels, but only for entertainment. There is also my cousin's wife, who is even stranger. She is a graduate of a prestigious high school, and her grades were among the best in school. But after graduation, she got married, and now her daily routine, besides eating and sleeping, is just playing mahjong, watching movies, and indulging in neurotic, hysterical daydreams. She never reads books. Even popular novels like those from the Saturday Evening Post, or loud Peking opera, she cannot understand or find interesting. My cousin, who studies literature, originally wanted to marry a woman with a background in literature | or at least someone who didn't dislike literature | to study and learn together. But now, he is accompanied by a woman who is like a blind person. No, a blind person is even more independent. She is always afraid that her husband will harm his health by studying too hard, and she nags him constantly. I don't understand why she has become like this? How can I make her understand? How can I help her study on her own? I hope you can give me an answer. | Liu Xunyue</p>
<p>The question raised by Mr. Liu is indeed an interesting one, and it is also very meaningful because it is related to the entire society, the entire women's issue.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement shouted the first cry for liberation of Chinese women, although a small minority have already walked out of their boudoirs and into schools, even this small minority is only limited to entering schools and cannot take another step into society. As Mr. Liu's example shows, even the most promising woman in school is finished after marriage. This phenomenon is still very, very common today. It's not just a few individuals; almost all knowledgeable women are in danger of falling into this fate. Ni Huanzhi is a representative work depicting the youth of the era around the May Fourth Movement, so the book says that Ni Huanzhi's wife cannot escape the stereotypes of this era. The transformation after Ni Huanzhi's death is just a little inspiration that the author gives to new women.</p>
<p>Therefore, people in society have become skeptical about the liberation of women, believing that women are basically parasites who are willing to give up on themselves and do not seek independence and liberation. Their reading is only for vanity, their knowledge is just a decoration, and they use it to gain the title of a modern woman to show that they are different from old-fashioned women. Therefore, they can associate with noble people, fall in love, and eventually marry a noble husband. This is their only hope in life.</p>

The last Los Angeles Games followed this idea, using a crowned trumpeter to call for global participation as the official logo of the Games. For the Berlin Games, Germany has selected a "bell" as the emblem of the Games. In addition, the Games will use the Zeppelin airship as a "caller" to invite South American countries to participate in Germany. The ship has contacted the radio station in the capital of Chile. Any new messages sent to the ship by the Organizing Committee will be broadcast to South American countries by radio as the ship crosses the Atlantic Ocean, greatly exciting listeners. The difference between ancient and modern propaganda methods is evident.</p>

<p>The Organizing Committee has reached an agreement with the country's land and sea travel industry. Personnel and athletes of the national delegations participating in the Games who travel on ships and trains of German companies will receive special discounts. There are several routes: North Atlantic Route, South American West Coast Route, South American East Coast Route, East Asian and Australian Route, Cuban-Mexican Route, African Route, North American Route, South Pacific and Central American Route, and East Asian Route. There are set discounts for travel and freight costs.</p>

<p>Given the noble significance of the World Olympic Games, the emblems and logos of the Olympic Games must not be used for commercial or industrial advertising. The Games officially announced on June 28th of this year that anyone who has not obtained the official written permission of the Games may not use the bell-shaped emblem of the Games for commercial advertising. The same applies to individuals and companies. In order to respect the Games, it is hoped that other countries in the world will also have the same clear decree to protect the emblem of the Games.</p>
<h3 id="e203">In the Autumn Rain <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>A Record of the Sino-Japanese Tennis Players' Exhibition</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Performed Exceptionally Well, Losing to Fujikura 3-6</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Rushed Around, Losing to Yamagishi 1-6</p>
<p>Yamagishi and other Japanese players who attended the Davis Cup returned to their country via Shanghai. Yesterday, at 12:30 PM, they were invited to the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club for an exhibition match. Approximately 700-800 people of various races came to watch, creating a lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, autumn rain fell during the match, diminishing its appeal. However, the spectators were happy to receive the rain after a long drought, and they were reluctant to leave despite getting wet. The competition was divided into two singles and two doubles matches, all of which were won by the Japanese players. However, Zheng Zhaojia's performance was unexpectedly wonderful, and he engaged in intense competition with the young Fujikura, ultimately losing 3-6. In the singles match between Qiu Feihai and Yamagishi, the situation was one-sided. Yamagishi showed his skills, and Qiu Feihai was unable to defend himself, resulting in a 6-1 defeat for Qiu. Yamagishi did not expend much effort. In the first doubles match, Fujikura and Nishimura played against Carlsen and Pennie Vieussen, but the match was not very exciting, with the Japanese players winning 6-4, 6-2. In the other doubles match, originally scheduled to be De Vau and Qiu Feihai, De Vau was late, so Carlsen and Qiu teamed up against Yamagishi and Nishimura. The rain became heavier after the first set, greatly reducing the interest. The result was also a 6-4, 6-2 victory for the Japanese players. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e204">Yamagishi <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Is the main player in the Davis Cup. He previously only played doubles, teaming up with Shizumura as a long-term partner. They are not only famous in the Far East but also enjoy a good reputation in Europe. Anyone familiar with tennis is likely to know Yamagishi and Shizumura. At the 9th Far Eastern Games held in Tokyo, Yamagishi and Sato Jiro, who committed suicide this year, were the singles representatives. Qiu Feihai fought against Yamagishi, but Qiu was exhausted and withdrew. Yamagishi has also performed in Tianjin and has participated in the Davis Cup three or four times. This year, due to Sato's suicide, he was promoted to the first singles representative, but was eliminated by Australia in the second week in Europe (4-1). At the Wimbledon Championships, Yamagishi was eliminated in the fourth week. Watching yesterday's performance, his true skills were rarely seen. His forehand and backhand shots were equally good, and the force of the shots was like arrows leaving the bow. Very few shots fell into the net or went out of bounds. When he had an opportunity, he was sure to win, hitting left and right, either deep into the baseline or close to the net, making it impossible for his opponent to defend. Qiu Feihai was manipulated and at a loss. His serve was also very powerful, and his high-pressure volleys at the net were excellent.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Fujikura <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The young Fujikura is a graduate of Meiji University. In 1930, the Meiji University tennis team came to Shanghai for a competition, and people in Shanghai saw his style. He was only 19 years old, and his older brother was 20 years old when he passed away last year. At that time, the young Fujikura was still a novice, unable to withstand a single blow from Lin Qiu. But today, three years later, Fujikura is far from what he used to be, and he is causing a stir. In the Davis Cup, he defeated Australia's McGrath, achieving the only victory. His style of play is similar to Yamagishi's. His shots are beautiful, both forehand and backhand are good, he has a lot of experience, and his own errors are very rare. Young and handsome, he is a great tennis player of the future.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Nishimura <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>He is a doubles player. In terms of doubles play, Fujikura seems to be inferior to him. His high-pressure shots are excellent, and his net play is also good. His face resembles Han Langen in the Fishermen's Song. At first, it doesn't seem like it, but looking closely, it's quite similar, and the more you look, the more similar it is.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Singles <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia and Fujikura started first. Both were young and had the same style of play, but Zheng's skills were not as deep, and he made many errors. Fujikura won four games in a row easily. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zheng boldly used his strength, and with his courage strengthened, his movements became smoother. He swept left and right, the shots were sharp and quick, and they happened to pass over the net. Fujikura imitated him, and his shots were also extremely swift. Both of them displayed their strengths, which was very entertaining and earned a lot of applause from the audience. Seeing the fierce attack, Fujikura tried to go to the net, but it was useless. Zheng won three games in a row, but lost his serve in the next game, and his momentum waned. Fujikura won 6-3. Next was Qiu Feihai against Yamagishi. Qiu tried his best to fight, but his opponent's shots were too strong. One shot came from the left, and another came from the right, and Qiu could not defend himself. 6-1, Qiu suffered a crushing defeat, taking very little time.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Doubles <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>After the singles matches, there were doubles matches. Fujikura and Nishimura played against Carlsen and Pennie Vieussen. It was drizzling constantly, the ground was slippery, and the ball was wet. Neither side played with much spirit, especially Carlsen and Pennie Vieussen, whose movements were poor, and they touched the net and hit the ball out of bounds a lot. There was a brief fight in the first set, and each side won with their serve. After Carlsen's serve failed, they lost 4-6. In the second set, they lost again 2-6. In the next doubles match, because the long-legged De Vau was late, Carlsen and Qiu teamed up to fight against Yamagishi and Nishimura. The interest was very good. Yamagishi and Nishimura's lobs never went out of bounds, and they landed right in front of the baseline, two or three feet away. Their high-pressure shots could cross the net at the baseline like cannonballs, no less than a 128-caliber cannon. At first, each side won with their serve, but after Carlsen lost his serve in the fifth game, they lost 4-6. At that time, the rain became heavier, and it was thought that the match would be stopped, but Qiu's enthusiasm was not diminished, and they had to continue the match. The wet clothes and shoes were not a concern. The new tennis rackets that the Japanese players had specially made in England were a real pity. In the lackluster match, Yamagishi and Nishimura won again 6-2, and the competition ended. The Japanese players are scheduled to return to Japan tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>(TASS, Moscow, August 1st Dispatch) The implementation of compulsory education in the Soviet Union is progressing exceptionally rapidly. At the end of 1933, the total number of students in schools was 21,813,400, which is almost three times more than in the period before the revolution, from 1914 to 1915. Mass education outside of schools, such as adult literacy classes, is also being promoted on a large scale. The most important aspect in implementing universal education is the industrialization of schools, which aims to bridge the gap between physical and mental labor. Many schools have been established in factories, and machine tractor stations, state-owned and collective farms have also established their own schools. The organization of labor productivity is closely related to theoretical education. The following figures show the development of education after the October Revolution (student numbers in thousands):</p>
<p>Year       Total number of primary and secondary schools  Number of primary school students  Number of secondary school students  Total number of students</p>
<p>1914-15    106.400                   7,113.6                  564.6                  7,800.6</p>
<p>1920-21    118.396                   9,206.8                  574.4                  9,781.2</p>
<p>1928-29    124.429                   10,468.4                 1,606.4                 12,074.8</p>
<p>1930-31    152.654                   15,609.1                 2,047.1                 17,656.2</p>

<p>The table shows that at the end of 1933, the number of primary school students increased by 251.2 percent compared to the period 1914-15, while the number of secondary school students increased by 643.6 percent.

<h3 id="e227">Test Oscillator <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>With a commonly used three-tube radio featuring single-stage regenerative detection and two-stage low-frequency amplification, only a multimeter and two batteries are needed to perform most repairs. However, this is not so easy with multi-stage tuned radio frequency or superheterodyne radios.</p>
<p>In general, the better the sensitivity and the better the selectivity of a radio, the more tuning circuits it has. The most complex radios today use variable capacitors with six or more gangs, and tuning circuits with more than ten stages. We know that the various stages of a radio must resonate with the incoming radio waves to achieve maximum efficiency. Therefore, radios using coaxial tuning must be absolutely synchronized at every stage, regardless of position. In other words, at any degree, the inductance and capacitance of each stage must be exactly equal to each other.</p>
<p>Of course, these radios have already undergone several extremely precise calibrations by the manufacturer before being sold. However, long-distance transport, prolonged use, or even a slight jolt can cause the various tuning circuits to lose their balance. Sometimes, even replacing a new vacuum tube can cause significant changes. Once the circuits are out of balance, it will not only significantly affect the sensitivity and selectivity of the radio, but also reduce the output volume and hinder clear sound quality.</p>
<p>Usually, to calibrate out-of-balance tuning circuits, one would first try to receive a broadcast from a distant station, and then adjust the trimming capacitors of each stage until the maximum sound level is achieved. This method of calibration is actually very difficult to be accurate. Because the human ear is not very sensitive to small changes in sound level (see "Ratio of Power to Volume" by this author in issue 43), and the strength of the radio waves coming from afar varies from time to time, it is indeed very difficult to obtain a satisfactory result.</p>
<p>From this point of view, it is best to have a small-scale signal generator of your own in order to cope with the situation with ease and not be at a loss. The so-called test oscillator is designed to meet this need.</p>
<p>The figure shows the simplest self-modulated test oscillator. The amount of amplitude modulation frequency varies with the amount of grid leak and grid capacitor. For the coil L, wind eighty turns of No. 22 double-stranded cotton-covered wire on a two-and-a-half-inch diameter cylinder, and tap a center line at forty turns. (See figure.) C is a 0.00035 mfd variable capacitor for adjusting the frequency. CI is a Io_mmf small variable capacitor for transmitting radio waves. The values of the other components are all detailed in the figure, so I will not repeat them here. (When using, connect end A to the antenna terminal of the receiving radio, and end G to the ground terminal.)</p>
<p>In order to save space, this article only briefly describes the need for and construction of a test oscillator. As for its usage and the calibration method for multi-stage tuning radios, I will write about it in detail later.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Filament Circuit Connection Method <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>When using vacuum tubes, the filament voltage must be absolutely accurate. Because the filament structure is fragile, if it exceeds its specified value, the filament will generate a large amount of current, suddenly increasing its temperature. This can cause the filament to emit excessive electrons, reducing the life of the vacuum tube, or even cause the filament to burn out immediately and be destroyed in an instant. Therefore, when designing a radio, do not neglect the filament circuit because it is relatively simple. Beginners should be especially careful, otherwise they will suffer great losses.</p>
<p>The number of vacuum tubes in a radio is not limited to one, and the voltage and current of each one are not necessarily the same, so the problem is more complicated. Usually, the connection of filament circuits is nothing more than the following three methods:</p>
<p>Method 1: Connect the filaments of each vacuum tube in parallel and then connect them to the power supply. If the power supply voltage is too high and does not match, a resistor R can be connected in series to reduce it to the appropriate value. The only condition for using this method is that the filament voltage of each tube must be exactly the same. As shown in Figure 1, the value of R can be calculated using the formula:</p>
<p>LE is the power supply voltage, E1 is the filament voltage,</p>
<h3 id="e229">Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>I1 I2 I3 is the filament current of each tube. For example, Figure 1 shows the parallel filament circuit of three vacuum tubes numbered 32, 30, and 33. The filament current of each tube is 0.06, 0.06, and 0.26 amps, and the voltage is 2 volts for all. The power supply is provided by two series-connected dry cells with a voltage of 3 volts. The value of R calculated according to the formula is Z.8 ohms.</p>
<p>Method 2: Connect the filaments of each tube in series and then connect them to the power supply. The power supply voltage should be equal to the sum of the voltages of each tube. If it is too high, a resistor R can also be connected in series to reduce it. The only condition for using this method is that the filament current of each tube must be exactly the same. As shown in Figure 2, the formula for calculating the value of R is:</p>
<p>E is the power supply voltage, E1 E2 E3 are the filament voltages of each tube, I is the current. For example, the filament circuit of the popular transformerless AC radio on the market uses this method. Now suppose a four-tube radio with vacuum tube models 3936, 38, and 25Z5. The filament voltage of 25Z5 is 25 volts, and the others are 6.3 volts. The filament current is the same at 0.3 amps. If connected in series and plugged directly into a 110V AC power supply, a resistor R must be added. According to the formula, it should be 220 ohms.</p>
<p>Method 3: This is also a parallel connection, similar to the first method, but it is used to compensate for different voltages of each tube. Vacuum tubes with lower filament voltages must be connected to a separate resistor R1 to reduce it, as shown in Figure 3. The calculation formula is:</p>
<p>E1 is the voltage at the common parallel connection, is the filament voltage of the E2 vacuum tube, I1 is its current. For example, in Figure 3, two tubes are No. 201 and one is No. 22. The voltage at E1 is the filament voltage of 201, which is 5 volts. E2 is the filament voltage of 22, which needs 3.3 volts. The filament current I1 is 0.132 amps (these numbers can be found on the vacuum tube characteristics table). The value of R1 calculated according to the formula should be 13 ohms.</p>
<p>The choice of the above three methods depends on the vacuum tubes used in the radio. If the filament voltages of each vacuum tube are exactly the same, the first method can be used. If the filament currents are the same, the second method can be used. If the voltage and current are different, then the third method should be used.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Ultra-Long Wave Transmitter <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Kexiao</p>
<p>Now in the radio world, everyone is moving towards ultra-short waves; but the author is running towards long waves. Isn't this reversing the course of radio? That's right. The disadvantage of long waves is that they consume a lot of power and their effectiveness is far less than that of short waves. But this ultra-long wave transmitter is an exception. Because it consumes very little power, and its transmitting effectiveness is not bad, because the frequency is close to low frequency, the receiving end equipment does not need a detector to hear the radio signal. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce it to amateur comrades. It's just that the author has not yet made a long-distance communication test with this transmitter, so I can only ask all amateurs to help with the test. The circuit of this ultra-long wave transmitter is shown in the left figure. V can use 30 or 201 vacuum tubes. If 27A or 47A is used, the range will be even farther, but the B voltage must be increased. T is an ordinary low-frequency transformer, one to three, or one to five. C, the capacitance is forty-six trillionths of a farad, or thirty-five trillionths of a farad. The depletion resistor R that controls the filament voltage, and the A voltage must be determined according to the vacuum tube used. K is the telegraph key. The size of the B voltage must be determined according to the communication distance. Within a large 1/2 mile, the B voltage must be 22 1/2 V. Within four or five miles, the B voltage is probably between 45 volts and 90 volts. The most important device in the whole machine is the ground wire, so the ground wire is best made of an iron bar about four or five feet long. Drive it into the near-wet soil, leaving about two inches of the iron bar above the ground, and then tightly wrap the iron bar with a piece of copper skin, and then weld the skin wire of the ground wire firmly with tin. The antenna type can be any type, but the cage type is the best. If the communication distance is short, the receiving end only needs to connect the earpiece directly to the heaven and earth lines (that is, connect the earpiece in series in the heaven and earth lines) to receive the signal. If you use a vacuum tube radio, that is of course even better, but the longer the wavelength, the more satisfactory the radio reception will be. Why don't all amateurs connect the old parts to try it out? Finally, the author said again that whether the ground wire design is excellent has a great relationship with the transmitting range of the transmitter and the receiving range of the radio. Please pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Effective Filtering Device <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Guizhen</p>
<p>Circuit Description: This filter is a combination of parallel resonance and series resonance methods, so its effectiveness is quite high. Its principle: the filter composed of LL1C resonates first, blocking the passage of the required frequency current. At the same time, the filter composed of C1L2 also resonates, making the required frequency current flow unhindered. Because the required frequency current has a large return resistance in the former circuit and a small return resistance in the latter, it can only choose the easier path.</p>
<p>Installation: LL1 is a mutual inductance coil. Use No. 30 enameled wire to wind 96 turns on a 1 and a half inch diameter tube to make LI, wind L for 15 turns at a distance of 2 points. C is a 0.00035 MFD variable capacitor. L2 is a self-inductance coil, which can be obtained by winding 60 turns of No. 30漆 on a 1 and a half inch tube. C1 is a 0.00025 MFD variable capacitor. The positions of LL1 and L2 should be at right angles to avoid coordination.</p>
<p>Effect: This filter can be used with any radio with low selectivity. Its adjustment method is quite easy: first apply C1 to the maximum capacity, then turn the variable capacitor of the radio to the required frequency, and then calibrate C to the same wavelength. If the selectivity is still not satisfactory, C1 can be slightly turned out, and then re-calibrate the other capacitors until satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e232">A Widow's Heart <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>In Liujia Village, with twenty-three households, the one who gets up earliest every morning is Sister-in-law Liu the Second.</p>
<p>Liu the Second died of illness last spring, leaving behind three to five mu of land and a dilapidated cottage. She was young and widowed, without children, without parents-in-law, all alone. She felt that her husband had treated her very well when he was alive, not calling her to do the heavy work in the fields. She simply couldn't bear to remarry. When she was a young girl, she heard people say that a woman who doesn't remarry after her husband dies is remarkable. People, perhaps even the officials in the yamen, would build her a memorial arch, and she would be praised forever.</p>
<p>It's still possible to support the household expenses alone, but that debt, with its monthly interest, felt like a thousand-pound stone pressing down on her, leaving her no days of ease. The debt was incurred when her husband died, from borrowing money to buy a coffin. Of course, she was responsible for repaying it. At this time, there was no other way but to work hard, doing her own field work and then helping other families with their busy work. Indeed, everyone in the village said that Sister-in-law Liu the Second was willing to endure hardship and withstand loneliness.</p>
<p>But after all, she was young, and the physical changes were quite distressing. And there was also—there was also the provocation of the seasons and the outside world. She saw how happy other people's wives were with their husbands, weeding in the same field, eating at the same plank table, resting in the shade of the same tree. As for herself, wherever she went, she dragged a sad, lonely shadow. When she couldn't bear the desolation of widowhood, her heart trembled.</p>
<p>"Am I really so lacking in fortitude?!" She would immediately suppress her trembling heart. The iron wall of morality surrounded her heavily, and it seemed like a tall memorial arch of chastity stood before her, emitting a bitter smile, reminding her of her husband's kindness when he was alive and the faces of many, many stern commentators from the outside world. And so, like a prisoner being watched, she worked, worked desperately, day, month, year—an endless succession of years, an endless lonely and desolate life.</p>
<p>When she saw a rooster chasing a hen around the threshing ground, she felt that the existence of beasts was more carefree and more free than that of people, because they simply didn't have this thing called "reputation."</p>
<p>And yet, Sister-in-law Liu the Second was still climbing towards that glorious memorial arch of chastity, sighing, "Ah, a virtuous widow?"</p>
<h3 id="e233">Modern Women and "Mōdan" Women <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Níng Yī</p>
<p>Speaking of "modern," unless you're not a modern friend, it would be strange if anyone said they didn't know! As for "Mōdan"? Perhaps some people don't understand, but it's actually one and the same with "modern," just a Japanese product? ||| "Modern" is translated as "Mōdan" in Japanese. |||</p>
<p>The modern women mentioned here naturally refer to our esteemed country's "misses" and hard-working ladies, while the "Mōdan" women naturally refer to the average Japanese "misses."</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, when it comes to modern women, the typical image in most people's minds is like this: ||| Perhaps this is an arbitrary assumption after being influenced by what they've seen and heard. ||| Their hair is permed, their faces are painted red like a monkey's butt, their qipao (cheongsam) is skin-tight, they wear high heels, their fingers and toes are painted with scarlet nail polish, they walk with a swaying waist, they know how to smile charmingly, chew Wrigley's gum, dance, smoke, and more... As for "Mōdan" women? They also know these tricks, but they walk with a straight posture, and their clothing is even more "Mōdan" than modern women, very few "Mōdan" women wear wooden clogs or kimonos, most are dressed in Western suits, completely Westernized, with no "Mōdan" air at all? But modern women? They still refuse to give up the qipao, to achieve the goal of complete Westernization? The result is like learning science from others, only getting a superficial understanding. One more point is worth noting, and it's the biggest difference: "Mōdan" women are completely Westernized, but their clothing material is domestic, while modern women refuse to give up the qipao, but their clothing material is always imported. The difference between modern women and "Mōdan" women lies in this, which is also the reason why "Mōdan" women are more valuable?</p>
<h3 id="e234">Women's Liberation and Not Wearing Underpants <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Miào Shén</p>
<p>Before women cut their hair, people advocated cutting hair, thinking that it could save expenses and time. But what is the result now? After cutting their hair, there's one more thing to do: perming it. Each electric perm costs six yuan, and a water perm costs ten yuan. The time spent is more than two or three hours, which is more expensive and more time-consuming than before. Who would have expected this?</p>
<p>Recently, there's also a trend of women going barefoot with bare legs. Their reason is: it's cool and comfortable, and it can also save a pair of socks, seemingly planning from an economic perspective again. Little do they know that some women apply white and fragrant Parisian powder on their legs, and paint their toes with bright rose-colored nail polish. This cost is much more expensive than a pair of socks. Obviously, it's gradually deviating from the original purpose of advocating, who would have expected this?</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated abolishing women's trousers (kù), replacing them with skirts. The reason is naturally similar to going barefoot with bare legs. In addition to that, there's another reason: it's said to reduce the mystery of women. For example, Japanese women don't often wear trousers, and their relationships between men and women are calm, and the issue of sex is not particularly indulgent. Western countries, such as French women, also don't wear trousers, only wearing Maillot, and they don't have any drawbacks. I believe that after a few more years, Chinese women will definitely not wear trousers either, truly returning to nature. As for the result, the consumption of makeup will be even more alarming!</p>
<p>For many years, has the result of the women's movement only been seeking the liberation of clothing and the liberation of sex? It's truly quite strange!</p>

<p>Old Man Chen couldn't sleep all night, thinking as much as he could.</p>
<p>Sometimes lying horizontally on the bed, sometimes taking puffs of his water pipe, slapping the banana leaf fan loudly in the mosquito net.</p>
<p>These past few years, he didn't know what bad luck he had encountered. Ever since he managed to get a lucrative position, he was quite powerful, with runners and servants working for him. Later, not long after, the government laid off staff, tax collection duty was prosperous and didn't bear great risks, so apart from this, he simply didn't want to condescend to any other work. However, sitting idle and consuming resources, how could he sustain it for three to five years with a little savings? It had long been pawned away. His old wife also died the year before, which made him feel even more pain. Fortunately, Heaven never cuts off all paths, his daughter was growing up, originally belonging to someone else's family, not expecting her to do anything. Now, he was entirely relying on her flesh to support him.</p>
<p>In his wild thoughts, it seemed that his conscience was severely condemned, but after a while, he acted as if nothing had happened. He heard that the daughter's room next door was silent, without any sound. ||| In fact, the door was still bolted shut from the inside, he knew, and he understood everything. But, where did the money for his effortless meals, his few puffs of smoke, and a few games of cards come from?</p>

<p>In the hazy morning mist, she swayed at the entrance of a hotel with a pale and exhausted face. Not long after, she hired a rickshaw, and turning along a city wall, S City wasn't very big, and her home wasn't far from the city.</p>
<p>Her father—Old Man Chen, was sound asleep, so she slipped into the gate without anyone knowing. The birds resting in the courtyard hadn't flown away yet, she couldn't care about anything, hastily opened her room door and went in, took off the gauze qipao outside, turned over, fell on the bed, forgetting all the pain.</p>
<p>It was already late morning, she woke up from her daze. The day's tasks, washing clothes, cooking, everything was waiting for her alone to take on!</p>
<p>Suddenly, she seemed to have lost something. Clearly, just now, she herself, because she was too tired, had casually put a five-yuan bill on the table, but it had disappeared!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Examination and Recruitment of Female Staff <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Zǐ Yún</p>
<p>The news that a certain large company was recruiting female staff spread quickly. In less than a week, it had received nearly three hundred applications, each application accompanied by a four-inch half-body photo and a letter. However, the company only needed to hire twenty-three people, and even with alternates, it would never be able to recruit more than fifty people. Moreover, at that time, eleven people had already been internally decided upon, introduced by directors and senior staff. So in reality, there were only twelve slots available.</p>
<p>There were only twelve slots, but there were nearly three hundred applications. Therefore, the examination committee, jointly organized by the three heads of the procurement department, personnel department, and accounting department, along with the assistant manager, first eliminated nearly two hundred applications from the nearly three hundred applications based on the beauty of the faces in the photos. Leaving one hundred applications, notifying them to come to the company for an interview on the morning of a certain day.</p>
<p>On the morning of that day, more than seventy people came one after another. The examination committee was set up in the assistant manager's office. The assistant manager sat at the desk. The three heads sat on the sofa against the wall. The female applicants were led into the assistant manager's office one by one by the teaboy, and were personally questioned by the assistant manager. The three heads each scored them. The scoring criteria were divided into four items: "Beauty," "Attitude," "Speech," and "Patience." After the exam, the average score of the three was calculated to determine whether to keep or eliminate them. As a result, twelve regular employees and twenty-three alternates were selected. However, it was announced to the public that there were twenty-three regular employees and twenty-three alternates. As for the salary, it was seventeen yuan per month, with one lunch provided by the company every day.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Visiting the Former Residence of Palace Maid Fei <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Shā Jīn</p>
<p>When mentioning Palace Maid Fei, people will feel very unfamiliar and indifferent. If I want to make you understand and be moved, then I have to start with her own history.</p>
<p>However, having said that, if I were to simply open the "Biography of Zhen'e" written by predecessors and copy it again, risking the crime of copying someone else's article, the length of the text would also exhaust your interest.</p>
<p>I'll just give you a hint here.</p>
<p>Have you heard of "Dr. Mei's" "Assassinating the Tiger?" If you nod and say yes, then you already understand her enough. She was a martyr who assassinated a bandit chief in the late Ming Dynasty to protect her chastity.</p>
<p>Once, on a snowy dusk, I and several people went to a residence in the Japanese Concession, pulling friends, stepping on the snow, and walked past the Temple of Confucius in the old city of Tianjin. Originally, it wasn't the concession area, but we had arrived in the so-called city. Our route originally followed Asahi Street and went straight to East Ma Road.</p>
<p>The architecture of the Temple of Confucius was still antique, as if it was sleeping soundly in this city. The evening mist gently shrouded it, like weaving its dream shadow. Looking from a distance, there was a tall building on the south side, seemingly very solemn and majestic. We were eager to see it clearly, and walked with slippery steps.</p>
<p>Having taken not a few steps, Jian Bo jumped up as if surprised and said:</p>
<p>"It's here!"</p>
<p>We thought he had found his love, as he had been heartbroken. Everyone asked him in unison:</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>He smiled and pointed to a small archway at the entrance of an alley next to the road. We took a look, and it turned out to be written on it:</p>
<p>"Former Residence of Palace Maid Fei of the Ming Dynasty."</p>
<p>It was written by Yan Xiu of Tianjin. The five large characters had a very thick and majestic style.</p>
<p>Several people, disregarding the muddy snow, jumped into the small alley, wanting to inquire and understand. The first person we encountered was a child selling pancakes; he said he didn't know. Then, we asked a middle-aged man who looked like a gentleman, and he said, "I just arrived too." Later, we met a very old man, and he said very sincerely:</p>
<p>"This place exists, but the house is already occupied by another family. The years are long, and the original ruins have been buried. Even if you could find it with great effort, there's nothing to see."</p>
<p>Our visit was thus interrupted. However, our interest was not exhausted. It wasn't until we saw clearly that the building in the distance was the Drum Tower of the old city of Tianjin that we came back.</p>
<p>After eating dinner, I immediately wrote in my diary:</p>
<p>"The former residence of Fei, a guest in Tianjin, is a few steps from the side of the Temple of Confucius, north of the Drum Tower."</p>
<p>It happened to be seen by Mr. Ding, and he said with a smile:</p>
<p>"This place, Mei Xiaoshu of Tianjin, calls it 'Fei Family Lane.' He also wrote two short poems on the portrait of the palace maid:</p>
<p>The history is vague, but the blood is fresh, A sword of righteousness lasts for a thousand years;</p>
<p>Still there is Qin Liangyu to fight alongside, Killing bandits and serving the king with her beauty.</p>
<p>A loyal heart like a mirror is hard to measure, Leaving behind only pity for the condensed tears;</p>
<p>It should transform into the snow of the Western Mountains, Cold light often shines on the Thirteen Tombs.</p>
<p>Although the poems are old-fashioned, they are still related to literature, why don't you copy them down as well?"</p>

<p>— (Yángzǐjiāng)</p>
<p>Time: 9:15 AM on August 15th of the 23rd year. (Using the grandstand clock as a standard.)</p>
<p>Location: Tram stop at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Ma Huo Road.</p>
<p>People: A young woman around twenty years old, with powder, rouge, a goose-yellow silk qipao, permed hair, high heels, a so-called modern woman.</p>
<p>What happened: The tram arrived at the station, and I was the first to get off. That young woman followed me off, but she didn't hold onto the copper pole, and her foot stepped down. Her right foot didn't stand firmly, and her left foot didn't jump down together.</p>
<p>The high heel of her right foot came off, throwing it out about three to five feet, and the young woman fell down slowly. I wanted to turn around and help her, but the tram driver had already started to help her up. The young woman was very ashamed and angry, and limped to the sidewalk to call for a rickshaw, which shows that she was in pain from the fall. Her face was red and white, a mixture of anger, shame, and fear!</p>
<p>Personal thoughts: The wearing of high heels by modern women has long been criticized by informed people. But criticism is criticism, wearing is wearing, I wonder if they will realize it after seeing my chronicle? (Yángzǐjiāng)</p>
<h3 id="e239">Emerald Melon Small Record <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— (Qī Fèng Lóu Zhǔ)</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read Mr. Shěn Qín's "Watermelon Lantern Essay" in this publication, which mentioned that Emperor Tongzhi had a watermelon lantern competition on a summer night, and a lotus concubine presented a lantern</p>
<p>, engraved with "Xiāoxiāng Hall Spring Slumber and Secluded Feelings Picture." Tongzhi was overjoyed when he saw it and rewarded her with a natural emerald watermelon, and said; "This is a famous treasure, I wonder if it still exists? Perhaps it was taken away when the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked?" and so on; I suddenly recalled that a few years ago, when the Eastern Tombs were excavated, many treasures were discovered. Four emerald watermelons were stolen from Empress Dowager Cixi's tomb, crystal clear and rounded, completely green, two were darker, called glass green, and two were slightly lighter, named plum blossom green, the value of which was unparalleled. Some say that it was contributed by the Western Regions during the Yuan Dynasty, but it's hard to verify after many years. Since these treasures have recently appeared, it's undoubtedly taken away by the Eight-Nation Alliance. However, according to rumors, these four melons were indeed secretly transported to England by a certain jewelry tycoon and sold at a high price. In recent years, Chinese treasures have flown overseas, I don't know how many, which is very regrettable.</p>

<p>Raw Gold Soars, Sterling Surprisingly Strong</p>
<p>Gold Standard Plunges by Nine Yuan Two</p>
<p>The gold market was affected by the surprise rise of raw gold and the sudden loosening of the British exchange rate. The silver market and the foreign exchange market were both affected, and the decline was particularly strong. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw British prices rise and American prices stay flat. London raw gold soared by ten and a half pence. The exchange rate fell again. American cotton fell by seventeen pounds per sound. American wheat rose and fell slightly. Stocks fell slightly. Goods opened steadily in the gross market, rising to above 55 yuan. Under the circumstances of rising gold prices and inflation, people's hearts were ultimately difficult to revive. The seller's activity was particularly strong. After a high, it went low again. The initial pre-market trading of American gold was extremely calm, but selling pressure was vaguely visible. After opening, it struggled to balance supply and demand. Although the exchange rate was loose, the banks were quite receptive and still showed a slight increase. A Reuters dispatch stated that people in the French exchange rate industry are confident that the pound will continue to fall, perhaps to a level of 70 francs per gold pound. (According to today's exchange rate, it is 74.96). Chinese merchants originally intended to sell. After that, the British exchange rate suddenly strengthened, and Chinese merchants took the opportunity to throw in the towel. Selling suddenly rose. Although the banks took advantage of the cheap price to buy, the Central Bank opened spot trading, slightly reversing the trend at the 50 yuan mark. However, the exchange rate was exceptionally loose, and the British exchange rate had reached beyond 1.5. The buying mood could not be revived, and people were timid. The falling trend resumed, plunging by ten yuan. At the noon closing, the banks were still buying at a bargain, and it was able to recover somewhat. The potential trend in the afternoon is still weak.</p>
<p>Although the opening market was flat, as Chinese merchants continued to sell wildly, the American dollar forward almost reached the 36 yuan mark. Bombay rose again by eight annas, and then fell again. Later, the market gradually improved as buyers saw low activity and major players also came to replenish. The domestic market also became tight, and the gold market stabilized. However, because the selling mood was still strong, it was inevitable to go down. Finally, it was able to maintain as Bombay returned to 2.3.3 annas. Now, the day's market situation is recorded below. The morning opening was 953 yuan and 9 jiao, a decrease of 7 jiao from the previous close. Goods opened at 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The morning opening selling price of the exchange rate was 1 shilling and 4 pence and 875. After opening, it was flat. Fúyú, Yǒngfēng, Dàdéshèng, Yìfēngyǒng, and Chāngyǒng went up, while Sēnyǒnglì and Fúxīngyǒng sold, dropping to 3 yuan and 4 jiao. Banks tied up December American gold at 5625. Yìchéng, Měifēngyǒng, Yuánmàoyǒng, Yuánfēngyǒng, Yúqìngyǒng, and Qìngfāyǒng advanced to 4 yuan and a half. Dàdéchéng, Héngyú, Zhàofēngchāng, Zhèngchāng, and Zhèntài were still selling. A preliminary announcement revealed that HSBC's list, both British and American, had risen by 125, dropping to 4 yuan. However, banks vigorously tied up December American gold at 5625. Yìchéng, Qìngyú, Dàdéchéng, Yúqìngyǒng, and Shùnlìlái advanced, gradually rising to 5 yuan. Unexpectedly, the domestic market was surprisingly loose, and Citibank actually stuffed December British gold at 1 shilling and 5 pence. Héngyú, Zhèntài, Tiānfēngyǒng, Fú'ān, Zhàofēngchāng, Dàdéchéng, Tóngchūn, and Yuánchūn all sold, dropping to 08 jiao. Citibank and HSBC bought up December American gold at 625. Yúqìngyǒng, Fúyú, Yìfēngyǒng, Yǒngfēng, and Dàfāyǒng bought at the low, rising to 2 yuan. People were extremely timid, and short-term British gold was difficult to sell. Zhàofēngchāng, Dàdéwēi, Yuánchūn, Tiānfēngyǒng, etc. sold vigorously, retreating into the 50 yuan range. Zhèngjīn and HSBC bought up October British gold at 1 shilling and 5 pence. The central government opened spot trading. Dàdéchéng, Yìchéng, Héngtài, and Ruìxīng gradually rose to 51 yuan. Yuánmàoyǒng, Zhèngchāng, Yǒngfēng, Yuánchūn, Zhèntài, Yúqìngyǒng, and Tiānfēngyǒng sold strips vigorously. December American gold at 6875 was difficult to sell, dropping further to 47 yuan. Yǒnglì, Zhàofēngchāng, Shùnmào, Dǐngkāng, and Qiánchāngxiáng advanced slightly, rising again to 8 yuan and 1 jiao. However, people's hearts were not boosted, and the news was unfavorable. Tóngchūn, Yúqìngyǒng, Hóngxīng, Dàdéchéng, Dàchāngxiáng, Yuányī, Dàxīngyǒng, etc. had a strong desire to sell. The buyers in the market lacked power. HSBC actually stuffed December British gold at 125, dropping further to 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Qìngfāyǒng, Dàdéchéng, Héngyú, and Yìfēngyǒng advanced strips. Huá Bǐ bought up December American gold at 875, gradually rising back to above 6 yuan. The noon closing was 946 yuan and 1 jiao. Goods were auctioned at 5 yuan and a half. After the close, it dropped slightly.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 945 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 5 yuan and 1 jiao. Fúxīngyǒng and Yìyú sold to 4 yuan and 2 jiao. Banks vigorously bought up November American gold at 8125. Fú'ān, Héngyú, Shùnmào, and Dàfāyǒng paid strips, rising to 5 yuan and 2 jiao. Bombay rose by 8 annas. Dàxīngyǒng, Shuǐlì, Tóngchūn, and Dàdéchéng sold, dropping to 2 yuan and 8 jiao. HSBC, Shanghai, and Citibank bought up December American gold at 9375. Bǐngxīng, Qìngyú, Héngyú, and Fúchāng advanced to 4 yuan and 6 jiao, but because Yuányī, Hóngxīng, and Dàdéchéng were still selling, it retreated to 3 yuan and 6 jiao. The bank's appetite turned healthy. Chūnyuányǒng, Zhàofēngchāng, Fúxīngyǒng, Zhèngchāng, Tiānfēng, Dàlián Bāng, Huìxiáng, Qìngfāyǒng, and Qiánchāngxiáng advanced strips in succession. Banks bought up December American gold at 875, rising to 6 yuan. Yuányī and Chūnyuányǒng sold, retreating to 5 yuan. Bombay returned to a small 2 annas. The closing price was 945 yuan and 4 jiao. Goods were auctioned at the same price. After the closing, Xiánghé was difficult to sell. Zhàofēngchāng and Yúqìngyǒng, etc. were still advancing and steady. The highest price of the day was 955 yuan, and the lowest price was 942 yuan and 8 jiao, a fluctuation of 12 yuan and 2 jiao. As a result, it fell by 9 yuan and 2 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price with the HSBC Bank's American exchange rate listing increased by 125 to 34 yuan and 75, equivalent to a gold standard price of 995 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen. According to the closing price, it was approximately 50 yuan, which was less than 6 yuan more than the previous closing. The registered price for September was 948 yuan, and for October it was 946 yuan. The morning supplemental water was 948 yuan, and the afternoon supplemental water was 947 yuan. The pure gold price was 964 yuan and 9 jiao. The situation in the market lacked formal transaction momentum and was sluggish, extending until after the afternoon closing before activity was seen. Because the gold price fell, the Tianjin Gang came to buy futures, with the spot number Yíngfēng Dàn, etc. selling at a price of 16 yuan and a half. The swap situation was chaotic, and the short side generally posted a slight margin. Yuánmàoyǒng, etc. posted a small amount. The central government opened hundreds of spot trades, sold by spot Yíngfēng Héng, Tóngfēng Héng, Dàdéchéng, Tàikāngrùn, Dàfēng Héng, etc., at a price of 952 yuan, and sometimes 951 yuan, and 9 yuan and a half. There were 1,176 September tickets remaining, with a total of eight long positions and eight short positions.</p>
<p>The market transactions lacked the power of buyers, and the appearance of supply exceeding demand</p>
<p>was still very clear. In summary, Wànxīng, Shùnlì, Yìfēngyǒng, Yìchéng, Fúxīngyǒng, Dàfāyǒng, Qìngfāyǒng, Yuánchūn, Dàfēng Héng, Tóngfēng Héng, Qiánchāngxiáng, Héngyú, Fú'ān, Shēnkāng, Dǐngtài, Fútàihēng, Qìngyú, Bǐngxīng, etc. were on the buying side.

<p>Currency Market Slackens Beyond Control</p>
<p>Pound Sterling Falls to Over Five Pence</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Nears Thirty-Six Yuan</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the London settlement rose by 1.25 points for both near and far terms, while the U.S. bank rate remained unchanged. London spot gold surged by 10.5 pence. Secondary exchange rates also fell; the British pound against the U.S. dollar decreased by 2.25 points, the U.S. dollar against the British pound decreased by 2 points, and the British pound against the French franc decreased by 32 pounds. The U.S. dollar against the French franc remained level. The currency market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices: the British pound at 1 shilling, 4.875 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 35.25 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound loosened by 1.25 points, while the U.S. dollar tightened by 0.0625 points. Immediately after opening, the market loosened. When HSBC posted its rates, both the British pound and the U.S. dollar rose by 1.25 points. Subsequently, the British pound first loosened, causing banks to take in U.S. dollars, but the dollar tended to harden. Market sentiment was extremely weary, and the currency market lacked any means of revitalization. Later, news of a large U.S. bond issuance caused the domestic market to harden further. The British pound had already exceeded 1.5, and its underlying trend was exceptionally poor. Although banks were taking in currency, it had no effect. The market situation remained loose, and banks continued to buy, but Chinese merchants were very eager to sell. Bombay reported a rate of 8 annas, making the market even harder, and the December U.S. dollar rate almost reached 36 yuan. Sassoon slightly took in shillings, and banks took advantage of the low prices to buy before the market turned flat. Bombay also eased by a small 2 annas. The Bank of Japan continued to take in currency. The closing near-term selling prices were: the British pound at 1 shilling, 5.0625 pence, and the U.S. dollar at 35.625 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound loosened by 3.125 points, and the U.S. dollar also hardened by 3.125 points. Chinese merchants sold approximately 300,000 pounds and 600,000 U.S. dollars. Today's trading prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e243">Particularly Heavy Month-End Settlements <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>||| Overnight call loan interest rates eased, falling by five points |||</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the month. The silver dollar market conditions were generally unchanged, but call loan rates added water, falling by five points due to ample overnight funds, resulting in a three-point market fluctuation. The market price for silver dollar call loans remained at one dime in the morning and afternoon. However, due to the month-end settlements and Chinese merchants settling out three to four million in silver dollars for rice and other commodities, settlements were particularly heavy. Call loan transactions in the morning reached over 3.4 million for transfers and over 400,000 for new transactions. Afternoon transactions exceeded 500,000, and transactions at the small general meeting exceeded 300,000. Silver dollar pawn loan transactions redeemed over 1.5 million and made new loans of over 3 million. Bank settlements included over 4.0 million in ticket amounts from foreign banks, over 6.8 million in settlements for various commodity exchange pawn loans and miscellaneous loans, over 4.0 million in settlements for account closures, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, over 2.5 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 1.2 million in warehouse entries. Chinese bank settlements included over 4.9 million in ticket amounts, over 7.2 million in settlements for various commodity exchange pawn loans, miscellaneous taxes, and other loans, over 3.5 million in settlements for account closures, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfer funds, over 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 800,000 in warehouse exits. Japanese bank settlements included over 3.4 million in ticket amounts, over 5.8 million in settlements for various commodity exchange pawn loans and miscellaneous loans, over 2.2 million in settlements for account closures, over 4.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 700,000 in warehouse exits.

Additionally, the total exchange amount at the clearinghouse on the 31st was 15,997,416.43 silver dollars, including 6,367,233.62 silver dollars and 9,630,182.81 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e244">All-Month Call Loan Interest Rates Set New Record <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Since the financial community switched to using silver dollar call loans, silver dollar positions have generally been loose due to market conditions, resulting in very few major changes throughout the year. Even the total amount calculated at the end of each month rarely exceeded two yuan, and deposit interest rates did not exceed this level either. This August's silver dollar call loan rates started with a flat first half of the month, but suddenly tightened in the second half, especially on the 24th, reaching a high of 1.5 dimes. As a result, the total interest for the entire month was 2.69 yuan. Averaging over 31 days, this equates to 8.645 cents per day. As a result, the Money Trade Association's regular meeting held for two days set a new record for deposit interest rates of approximately 2.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Silver Coins Show Divergent Trends <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver coins showed a strengthening trend again. The market opened in the morning with a rise of one yuan, trading at 834 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose another 1.5 yuan, trading at 835.5 yuan. As a result, it rose by 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 5,000 coins in the morning and 3,000 coins in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were at 740 yuan in the morning and changed to 739.7 yuan in the afternoon, resulting in a decrease of 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 90,000 coins in the morning and 40,000 coins in the afternoon. Copper coins were at 328,500 cash, the same as the previous day, with a trading price of 8,500 silver dollars, equivalent to 27,922 strings and 500 cash.</p>

<p>Bond Market Continues Under Strong Selling Pressure</p>
<p>|| Declines Range from Twenty to Seventy Cents ||</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the rumors in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange subsided, the market still showed no signs of recovery. People were generally influenced by exaggerated rumors and held deeply ingrained bearish views. Therefore, as soon as the market showed any rebound, it was suppressed by selling pressure. This reflects the market's unease. Observing this situation, it is clear that unless new forces join the market, it will be difficult to expect the market price to recover in the short term. Yesterday morning, after a sharp decline, there was a sudden rebound at the opening. Reorganization bonds initially rose by 7.5 cents, as if there was a rising trend ahead. However, after entering the market, the rising momentum was not strong. The rise in consolidated salt tax and other bonds slowed down. Sixth Consolidated bonds, which had plummeted two yuan the previous day, only recovered three or four cents. The instability was evident. When the second session opened, a sharp decline began, becoming stronger later on. Short-term gold bonds fell by more than one yuan, wiping out all the gains from the first session and even exceeding them. In the afternoon, another session was held, and the downward trend continued. Reorganization bonds and other bonds fell by as much as half a yuan. Towards the end, there was some short-covering in the forward market for Customs bonds, and the market price slowly rebounded, seemingly turning for the better. However, when it came to Sixth Consolidated bonds, the market felt weak and unable to rise, and the market price fell another ten to twenty cents. Overall, the market price fell by twenty to seventy cents. The total trading volume was 24,915,000 yuan. (The exchange announced that starting today, it will switch to three sessions per day for one week.) A comparative table of the high and low results is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Initially Fell, Then Slightly Recovered</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market initially fell, then rose, showing a slightly calmer trend. The recent decline had been too sharp, falling by more than ten yuan from its peak. This prompted profit-takers to cover their positions, causing the market to rebound. At the same time, sales of spot yarn were higher than yesterday. However, most market sentiment still leaned towards selling short, as the inventory in warehouses was difficult to empty. Nevertheless, the cotton market was still strong, so the yarn market might become slightly stronger.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market opened lower in the morning due to another decline in U.S. cotton, causing market sentiment to become more uncertain. Floating long positions were closed out, and sellers took advantage of the opportunity to exert strong downward pressure, causing the decline to intensify. Market sentiment was extremely fearful. The current month broke through the 177 yuan level, and deferred months also fell. As a result, each month fell by two, four, one, four, five, and seven cents. The market opened weaker in the afternoon, with depressed sentiment, and deferred months hit new lows. Around the second and third trading sessions, the cotton market rose, pulling up the yarn market. Short sellers, seeing that the market had stabilized, rushed to cover their positions, causing the current month to jump to 178 yuan. At the same time, there were reports of over 800 bales of spot yarn being sold, pushing market prices even higher. As a result, each month recovered by seven, eight, and nine cents. The total trading volume for the day was 76,700 bales. According to records, Heng Yi sold 3,400 bales, Ji Feng 950 bales, Qing Feng 1,300 bales, Yuan De 750 bales, Shen Ji 3,500 bales, Yuan Yi 2,050 bales, Tai Chang 2,400 bales, Heng Chang 2,300 bales, Tong Fu 850 bales, Hui Kang 700 bales, and Yong Da 1,400 bales. Yuan Yi bought 1,550 bales, Rui Chang 1,200 bales, Xin Chang 700 bales, Da Feng 700 bales, Tong Fu 1,750 bales, Yuan Da 1,700 bales, Yuan Da 1,700 bales, Chang Yu 4,600 bales, Chang Feng 1,850 bales, Xie Sheng 1,350 bales, De Ji 1,500 bales, Yuan De 1,400 bales, Run Kang 1,250 bales, and Xin Cheng 700 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales were higher than before. According to statistics, various local merchants bought a total of 869 bales for the day. Prices fell by five cents to one yuan. The purchase amounts for each local merchant are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 225, Changsha: 60, Ningbo: 55, Xiamen: 5, Mainland: 240, Northern: 132, Jiangxi: 20, Wuhu: 10, Yunnan: 100, Nanjing: 12, Peers: 10.</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, showing a fairly strong trend. However, foreign cotton tended to fall. Local sentiment was still tight, and there was talk of forming long positions. Another rumor suggested that the weather was bad and there might be prolonged rain after the long dry spell. As a result, buyers became active, and the market rebounded after falling. However, large short sellers remained calm.</p>

<p>The cotton market opened lower in the morning, following foreign cotton and the yarn market. Market sentiment was exhausted, and all months fell by three cents. When trading resumed in the afternoon, the market changed suddenly, with prices rising in every session. The reason for this was said to be the irregular climate, with clouds in the sky, raising fears of prolonged rain. Currently, cotton is in the process of opening up. Another report stated that it had been raining in Shandong for a week, and there was flooding in Tongzhou. All these news were favorable to long positions. As a result, buyers and short-covering investors gathered together, causing the market to rebound significantly. The September contract exceeded the previous day's high, and all months rose by three cents. The total trading volume for the day was 184,300 dan. According to records, Chang He sold 6,300 dan, De Ji 3,500 dan, Xin Hua 1,600 dan, Xie Sheng 3,000 dan, Yuan Yi 5,400 dan, Ren Feng 5,200 dan, Chang Yu 2,100 dan, Jun Chang 1,400 dan, Yuan Da 2,300 dan, Geng Feng 2,100 dan, Tong Ji 2,700 dan, Yuan Da 2,000 dan, Ji Feng 6,200 dan, Rui Chang 2,000 dan, and Xin Cheng 2,200 dan.

<p>Few Changes in Grades</p>
<p>The Chinese Textile Exchange held a cotton yarn assessment meeting on August 25th to review the grades of cotton yarn for substitution for February 1935 deliveries. As a result, only Wuxi Zhenchang's 20-count Ball Crane yarn was reduced by one yuan compared to the previous period. Da Chang Bao Xing Factory's 20-count Red Star yarn was increased by four yuan compared to the previous period. The grades of the remaining 16-count and 10-count yarns were the same as in the previous period. The changed yarn brands are listed below:</p>
<p>| Old Price | New Price |</p>
<p>| ------- | ------- |</p>
<p>| 20-count Ball Crane Yarn | Down 2 Yuan | Down 3 Yuan |</p>
<p>| 20-count Red Star Yarn | Down 8 Yuan | Down 4 Yuan |</p>
<p>Also, the August 29th assessment meeting reviewed the standard cotton grades for substitution for February 1935 deliveries. The results were the same as the January grades, with no changes in coarse or fine cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was weak due to reduced buying, sluggish cloth sales, and selling in the South. As a result, spot prices fell by twenty pounds, and futures prices fell by fourteen to seventeen pounds. British cotton futures fell by one or two points. Indian cotton was firm due to buying by speculators. As a result, Full Good Oomra and Broach were both up 15 rupees. The original telegram records are listed below (August 30th telegram):</p>

<p>Large Delivery Quantities</p>
<p>Flour reaches 24,000 bags and 63 cars</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for August flour futures. The total number of contracts actually fulfilled at the exchange for the entire day reached 224,000 bags, including 177,000 bags of Battleship flour and 47,000 bags of Battery flour. It was reported that off-exchange deliveries also reached over 100,000 bags. It was heard that most of the recipients were hedgers from the banking industry. Only over 10,000 bags were delivered to this street, and there was no news of deliveries to out-of-town customers. The ample supply from the factories and the clear sales volume indicate that the future outlook may be continuously weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday's statistics for the delivery of August wheat futures showed an increasing quantity. Since the factories had been sluggish, customers could no longer reject the goods, so the number of deliveries to the exchange also surged. The total number was 67 cars, including 5 cars delivered on the 6th, 11 cars delivered on the 16th, 7 cars delivered on the 35th, 11 cars delivered on the 26th, 3 cars delivered on the 19th, and 30 cars delivered on the 27th. The recipients included 2 cars received by the 1st, 2 cars received by the 5th, 2 cars received by the 7th, 3 cars received by the 19th, 35 cars received by the 23rd, 3 cars received by the 24th, 13 cars received by the 27th, and 7 cars received by the 28th. Only two cars of standard yellow soybeans were delivered, and only 400 dan of soybean oil.</p>

<p>||| Initial Price Opened at Four Yuan and Forty-Five Cents |||</p>
<p>Yesterday, new soybeans from Poyang, Jiangxi entered the market. The first batch of 51 bags arrived and were of good quality. The initial price opened at four yuan and forty-five cents. Only Fa Cai Street saw some sales. It will be difficult to determine prices for future batches. Only 34 bags were opened at Chengmendou yesterday, and the market continued to fall by two cents, with a price of four yuan and one cent. However, there were still over a thousand bags of early yellow soybeans from Hankou being sold. High-quality goods were scarce, and mid-grade goods were plentiful. Market prices were gradually falling. Yesterday, second-grade golden peel soybeans opened at three yuan and six cents, and white peel soybeans opened at three yuan, five cents and eight cents. The future for new beans is becoming increasingly thorny, with more insults than honors in the overall market. There was no news of inquiries about old beans for the time being. Sales to other groups were scarce. However, inland speculators took action yesterday, purchasing over 1,700 bags of Guide beans at a price of three yuan and two cents, a decrease of one cent and a half compared to the previous market. The high price beans will not easily become cheap. Zhengyangguan beans continued to open at three yuan and six cents, and five cents and eight cents.</p>

<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Theories in the world are sometimes odd, sometimes even; sometimes opposing, sometimes supporting; some are singular, others plural. If the concept of something cannot tolerate concepts beyond itself, then positivity can be relative, opposing, stimulating, and complementary. Otherwise, there will be chaos, contradiction, inability to affirm oneself, and even less to affirm others.</p>
<p>Those with broad knowledge and experience, having many perspectives, are most likely to fall into this chaotic state. Just like solving an extremely complex mathematical problem, a moment of carelessness leads to more and more divergence and confusion. And what about those who are unwilling to think? They often err in the most superficial reasoning, being controlled by a few words, unwilling or unaccustomed to thinking.</p>
<p>Holding this view and looking at various theories today, it is truly a demon-revealing mirror showing their true forms. For example, if you say that Western-style houses are good because they have good lighting and air circulation, the ordinary response can be divided into several types. One is that China also has good houses, therefore Western-style houses are not good. Second, living in Western-style houses is for the wealthy, the wealthy are not good, so Western-style houses are not good. Third, there are too few Western-style houses, and 99% or more of people in China do not live in Western-style houses, so we should not live in Western-style houses, therefore Western-style houses are not good. Fourth, ancient Chinese people did not live in Western-style houses and were still healthy, therefore Western-style houses are not good. ||| This is one example.</p>
<p>This is because the respondent is not thinking, or deliberately saying things.</p>
<p>Another example is that Nietzsche's Superman is merely Nietzsche's thought. But it is said that "if the greatness is only personal," then "there is no use whatsoever." Why? Because "even if there were a hundred Nietzsches, they could not build even one percent of a pyramid in Egypt." Why Nietzsche should be punished to move stones in Egypt to build pyramids is something only a Chinese thinker could imagine. That greatness must have a use is also one of the odd theories. How is it that "personal greatness" has no "use"? It truly belongs to the "chapter of odd theories" ||| This is another example.</p>
<p>Again, it is not thinking, or deliberately saying things.</p>
<p>Ordinary people are easily dazzled by a few people who are willing to think but also have other purposes, because</p>

<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>Because of the quiet outside the city, and to make it easier to read and write, I moved to Da Chun Bridge, the headquarters of this impoverished area.</p>
<p>Those who have lived in Changsha for a long time almost all know that although Da Chun Bridge is too far from the city and inconvenient for transportation, it is Changsha's only "concession." In 1929, when the Red Army entered the city, all places suffered some losses, but Da Chun Bridge was safe and sound. In terms of terrain, Da Chun Bridge really couldn't be better! It is surrounded by mountains on three sides, and the Xiang River runs across the front; a few dozen steps further and you're in the idyllic countryside. I heard that ten years ago, this was still a desolate graveyard, with a small stream flowing into the Xiang River, and a stone bridge across the stream, which is Da Chun Bridge.</p>
<p>Since wealthy people built houses here, more and more people have come to build thatched huts. Now, the residents of Da Chun Bridge, besides two-tenths being wealthy and two-tenths being small merchants, the rest are all poor people who don't even have a foothold.</p>
<p>We initially thought that a sparsely populated place would have fresh air, but here, it's an exception. The Changping Railway is right behind the house, and every day you can hear the train, sounding like a ghost wailing, passing by five times, bringing with it a sky full of black smoke. If at that time you carelessly look up, you will immediately shout, because coal ash has come to visit you.</p>
<p>Suffering all day from the whistle sound and coal ash smoke is not enough, we also have to endure the pushing wheelbarrows, which constantly send a lot of dust in through the window with their constant "ji jie, ji jie" sounds. Like the weather when a strong wind blows in the north, if you don't wipe it for an hour, the dust on the table will be at least three-tenths of an inch thick; if you continue to sit still for two hours, the dust will turn you into an old man with white hair and a yellow-faced actor.</p>
<p>There are even more annoying things: a group of young hooligans play ball outside the window during the day,</p>
<p>and throw small stones in for no reason at night. Although we caught a hooligan ringleader and sent him to the police station the day before yesterday, and had two days of quiet, who knows if he will come back with a vengeance after being released?</p>
<p>Several friends have advised us to move, but when I think about the real advantages of Da Chun Bridge, I don't want to move again.</p>
<p>Two houses past ours live two blind fortune-tellers, three children who pick up coal cinders, Fu Yazi who sells sesame candy on a cart, Wang Er who sets up a stall selling salvaged goods, midwife Fu Saozi, rickshaw puller Si Mazi, a group of refugees who have just fled from the countryside, and several beggars who are cursed and scolded every day and have no names. Some of them sleep with pigs, separated only by a few bamboo fences; some have more than ten family members living in a small thatched hut that is less than ten feet across; some have nothing at all, only a broken bowl in their hands, begging in the streets and alleys during the day, and randomly collapsing in some corner of a public toilet at night, sleeping until dawn.</p>
<p>If you are not afraid of the smell, dirt, or heat, you can run to their thatched huts every night to chat, and I guarantee you will gain unlimited new knowledge. For example, Tan, who just fled from Xinhua the day before yesterday, will tell you how dry the countryside is, and how many farmers are starving to death and committing suicide, which is horrifying. He said, "These people die like dogs, rolled in broken mats, and thrown into earthen pits." He also said, "In the past, when farmers faced famine years, they only knew to starve to death with empty stomachs. Now, they know how to organize into teams to go to the houses of those who have grain to eat row by row." (Note)</p>
<p>Si Mazi, the rickshaw puller, will also tell you how the police oppress the poor and act as running dogs for the wealthy. When a car comes, if the rickshaw stops even a little too slowly, they will immediately beat you half to death with a stick. "Damn it, one time I saw only a driver in the car, and the police saluted him at attention. Haha, damn bootlicker!"</p>
<p>In addition, there are Fu Yazi, Liu the blind man, etc. They will each tell you many different stories, which are all the best materials for your writing.</p>
<p>Walking past Da Chun Bridge, less than a hundred steps away, this area of ​​Meifengming Garden, XX Garden, are all places where coffins are temporarily stored. Sometimes, you can see thousands of people sending off coffins every day, blowing and beating, carried from the city (naturally, these are important people or wives/grandmothers of important people, etc.). As long as you're not blind, everyone wants to run over and watch the excitement: but when they come back, they curse,</p>
<p>"Damn it, so extravagant, where did the money come from?"</p>
<p>At night, on the dark road (there used to be a street lamp, but it broke long ago), many men and children are lying across and lengthwise, wearing only a pair of torn pants. If wealthy gentlemen and ladies come back from the theater in the middle of the night and kick Wang Er's head or step on Fu Yazi's foot, they will definitely curse loudly: "Good dogs don't block the road, these uneducated animals, they deserve to die!"</p>
<p>This curse sometimes wakes you up from a good dream.</p>
<p>Da Chun Bridge, this is Da Chun Bridge's summer night.</p>
<p>"Note" Groups of farmers go to the landlord's house to eat when there is a drought. After eating at one house, they go to another. This is called eating row by row, or just eating in rows.</p>

<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(7) Illiterate Writers</p>
<p>The summary of ancient words written in such difficult characters, we used to call "wen," and now the more modern ones call it "wenxue." This wasn't cut from "wenxue, Ziyou, Zixia," but was imported from Japan, their translation for the English word "Literature." Those who can write such "wen," and now can also write in vernacular, are called "wenxuejia," or "zuojia."</p>
<p>The primary condition for the existence of literature is the ability to write characters. Therefore, there certainly cannot be any "wenxuejia" among the illiterate masses. However, "jia" can exist. Don't laugh at me too soon, I still have something to say. I think that humanity had creation before it had writing. It's just a pity that no one recorded it, and there was no way to record it. Our ancestors, the primitive people, couldn't even speak. In order to work together, they needed to express their opinions, so they gradually developed complex sounds. If everyone was carrying wood and felt it was difficult, but couldn't think of how to express it, and then one person said "Hang yu, hang yu," then that is creation; everyone should admire and apply it, and that would be equivalent to publication; if some mark was used to preserve it, then that would be literature; that person would of course be a writer, and also a "wenxuejia," the "Hang yu Hang pai." Don't laugh, this work is indeed very childish, but the ancients were inferior to people today in many ways, and this is one of them. Even the "Guan guan jujiu, in the river island, graceful lady, a good match for the gentleman" from the Zhou dynasty—it's the first poem in the "Classic of Poetry," so we're so scared that we can only kowtow in admiration. If there hadn't been such a poem before, and a modern poet used this idea to write a vernacular poem and tried to submit it to some supplement, I think nine out of ten times it would be stuffed into the wastepaper basket by the editor. "A pretty good lady, is a good match for the young master!" What is that?</p>
<p>Many of the things in the "Guofeng" section of the "Classic of Poetry" are also the works of illiterate anonymous people. Because they were relatively excellent, everyone passed them on by word of mouth. The royal officials took them out and recorded them because they could be used as administrative references. How many others were eliminated, we don't know. The two great epics of the Greek Homer—let's assume there was such a person—were also originally recited orally; what exists now is someone else's record. The "Zi Ye Ge" and "Du Qu Ge" of the Eastern Jin to Qi Chen dynasties, and the "Zhu Zhi Ci" and "Liu Zhi Ci" of the Tang dynasty, were all originally created by anonymous people, and passed down after being recorded and embellished by literati. This embellishment, while allowing them to be passed down, unfortunately certainly lost much of their original appearance. Now, there are folk songs, mountain songs, fishermen's songs, etc. everywhere, and these are the works of illiterate poets; and there are fairy tales and stories being told, and these are the works of illiterate novelists: they are all illiterate writers.</p>
<p>However, because there is nothing to record the works, they are easily lost, and the scope of circulation cannot be very wide, so very few people know about them. Occasionally, a little is seen by literati, who are often surprised and absorb it into their own works, as new nourishment.</p>
<p>When old literature declines, a new transformation often arises by absorbing folk literature or foreign literature. This example is commonly seen in literary history. Illiterate writers, while not as refined as literati, are robust and fresh.</p>
<p>For such works to be shared by everyone, the writer must first be able to write, and at the same time, readers must be able to read and even write. In a word: give writing to everyone.</p>

<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Who knew that the day before I was supposed to set off, after Mom had chosen a good day for me to leave, Wang Er's mother came to ask if we had seen her Wang Er. Only then did Mom realize that her younger brother was not around, and she became anxious. So everyone went out to look for him separately. Mom went to check the cabinets, and everything was fine; the money was also fine; nothing else had been touched at all. Only then did Mom start crying, holding the sweaty clothes that my younger brother had just changed out of yesterday. She cried that she shouldn't have forgotten about his schooling; she hadn't taken good care of him; she hadn't even sewn him a good piece of clothing; and if he was going to leave, he didn't even choose a good day, and left without taking a single penny!</p>
<p>"How can I be worthy of him!" Mom cried like that.</p>
<p>Later, in desperation, Mom could only hope that he had gone to relatives' place. She carefully selected many of his clothes, packed them in my suitcase, and even specially took out a biscuit tin that my younger brother usually loved and filled it with some sugar-fried rice puffs. "When you see your younger brother, say, 'Here, this is for him, tell him not to forget Mom...'"</p>
<p>Mom choked up and cried as she said this, tears dripping into the rice puff tin.</p>
<p>"How can I finish thinking about it! When you hadn't come home yet, he said, 'Mom, you've worked hard, I'll watch the store next year.' I said, ... And he said, 'Mom, don't make clothes for me anymore, I can still wear my older brother's...' How could I know that he was just deceiving me to leave! He threw away so many thoughts, how can I..."</p>
<p>Mom couldn't continue speaking as tears welled up again. I was truly ashamed, standing helplessly beside her.</p>
<p>"Mom, Younger Brother won't get lost, he must have gone there. I don't want to take a sedan chair anymore. I'll walk too."</p>
<p>Mom suddenly opened her eyes wide and looked at me, her lips trembling with emotion.</p>
<p>"No," she said. "The sedan chair has already been booked, take it, don't let people laugh at you! Still take the sedan chair, Mom can eat congee if it's okay. As long as you do well outside, rise higher and higher every day, and earn money to come back. You just need to remember to tell Younger Brother, don't forget Mom..."</p>
<p>I sat in the sedan chair and left my hometown amidst many envious glances. When I arrived at my relatives' place, they indeed said that my younger brother was already there. They originally said they would call him back right away, but he refused no matter what. He said he could even work as a stoker. So they had no choice but to leave him here as a soldier.</p>
<p>On the day I arrived, I really wanted to see him right away, but he wouldn't come no matter what. It wasn't until the third day that I saw him rushing happily towards me at the entrance of the secretariat. I almost didn't recognize him. He had already changed into a gray cloth military uniform, with a small white identification tag hanging on it. This change in him made me feel a bit of subtle pain in my heart. Thinking about our differences, I felt very uneasy. I was just about to greet him, but he turned around and ran out. After that, although we met, it was only a few words, without any good news...</p>
