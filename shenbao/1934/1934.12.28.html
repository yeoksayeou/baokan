<p>電通社東京電訊｀關於日本廢棄華府條約之通告文廣田外相己於二十六日電令駐美大使通告華盛頓當局。同時則由日外務省向中外聲明旨趣一則曰倫敦軍縮會商。豫定明春適當時繼續進行。再則曰廢約係根據條約之當然權利。據此則日本之决心廢棄華府條約。己成事實矣。夫以倫敦海軍軍縮豫備會議之經旬擾攘。卒不能藉世界人士和平呼籲之力量。以挽回軍備競爭之危險於萬一。誠可慨也。</p>
<p>夫今日世界人士。罔不知人類和平之重要。試觀日昨德國戈培爾氏演說。尚謂德國不僅口言和平。而爲誠心和平。英皇播音。則稱各國須以大家庭精神。應付國家困難。美總統羅斯福則言和平爲本人唯一志願。卽日本此次己通告廢約。亦未嘗不排斥軍備競爭。而期望軍縮之明年續談。顧吾人就今日之大勢以觀。則未免與事實不符。試觀各國軍備擴張之熱烈。不必旁徴博引。卽檢查數月來之報紙。己經顯然。除列强一律擴大軍事預算外。或則注意空軍。或則趕造軍艦。或則秘密完成殖民地要塞之工作。目的無一不在爭奪海外市塲。無一不集中注目於太平洋有事之一日。則安能望軍縮之再覔佳果。又安能望世界和平之實現哉。</p>
<p>競爭軍擴之政策。其足以動摇東亞和平者。其意義實與市塲競爭政策。互爲表裏。目前華府條約之所以陷於不能維持之局勢。卽無異爲熱心對外侵略之結果。遠者如九一八事變之發生無論矣。近則一年以來。如日本於遠東種種凖備外。與英爭市塲於印度。與美整備爭短長於菲律濱。與荷蘭則爭傾銷於東印度。皆太平洋和平大局不能一日安之基本原因也。特廢約以後。太平洋和平大局之不能維持。更爲顯然耳。</p>
<p>雖然我國固與遠東和平大局極有關係之國家也。華府條約之維持。其基本對象。本爲太平洋列强均勢之維持。自前次歐洲大戰之後。各國創夷未復。得以苟安靜鎭於一時。今則時易勢移。雖經濟恐慌之餘潮。尚動盪於今日之世界。而國力則己稍蘇。各種建設。逐漸回復舊觀。乃思有以向外發展而又防人之來侵。於是復以其稍稍蘇甦之國力。移用於整頓軍備之地。而軍擴之形勢以成。太平洋爭霸之雄圖愈急。則列强均勢之局面以破。我國處此形勢之中。將何術以應付之哉。</p>

<p>新聲社記者昨晨往訪錢業同業公會主席秦潤卿｀據談｀中央中國交通三銀行｀指定調劑金融現欵｀暫定一千萬元｀雖未規定銀行若干錢莊若干｀但大致爲銀錢兩業各五百萬元｀利息自七厘至八厘｀隨時决定之｀卽日實行｀如各銀行錢莊所需要總數起過一千萬元時｀得再與三銀行商定增加｀此項辦法｀實係預防而己｀</p>
<p>庫存充足</p>
<p>滬市存銀｀目前截止｀總約三萬萬元左右｀各銀行錢莊庫存甚爲充足｀况兩業之凖備機關凖備財産｀均係道契房産有價證券等｀甚爲可靠｀今與三銀行决定調劑金融辦法後｀故滬市金融｀决可無虞｀至於洋拆高漲至四角｀係平常之事｀供過於求則跌｀求過於供則漲｀每年三四角之洋拆極普通云云｀</p>
<p>上述公務外｀當順道與兩粤諸故舊同志等把晤｀蓋本人離粤己有七年｀各方老友｀均己多時未曾謀面｀胡漢民先生在港｀當然亦在訪晤之列｀對於政治問題｀自難免談及｀惟本人以爲西南諸同志與中央之團結｀最近己臻圓滿｀本人此去時｀卽有所談及｀亦不外在使同志間之精神｀能有更進一層之密切而己｀</p>
<p>獎銀進口表示可能</p>
<p>記者詢以關於獎勵銀進口事｀財部方面之處置如何｀據孔氏談｀前以美國實行提高銀價｀致一般企圖牟利者｀紛紛運銀出口｀政府爲維護國内經濟基礎之穏定｀不得不施行徴收銀出口稅及平衡稅｀其目的在防止現銀繼續流出｀最近一部份銀行界私人方面｀建議獎勵運銀進口一節｀本人對此｀表示可以辦到｀如有人願運銀進口｀作正黨營業上之投資｀經過合法之登記手續將來再行出口時｀政府與以免徴銀稅及平衡稅變通辦法｀而爲情理中所可允許之事｀</p>
<p>與美續商白銀問題</p>
<p>孔氏續談｀中國與美國政府續换關於白銀問題照會一事｀最近仍繼續由兩國政府相互磋商中｀因美國政府施行白銀政策｀對中國經濟上之影響趨勢｀中國政府向美國早有誠摰之照會｀美方亦曾表示願與中國互相恊作｀以謀中國金融之穏定｀美政府實行白銀政策｀减少中國金融上之困難｀現亦正在洽商中｀蓋中美爲太平洋兩主要國家｀兩國邦交素爲融洽｀美總統羅斯福氏｀亦與我國向表同情｀對中國情形｀且有深刻之了解｀故余深信｀基於中美兩國經濟上連繫關係之重要｀美國必能深切顧到白銀問題與中國關係之密切｀而謀有適當之處置｀俾達到共同改善國際經濟環境之目的云｀</p>
<p>中越商約外部辦理</p>
<p>最後孔氏稱｀關於中法越南商恊之簽訂｀係由外交部負責商洽之中｀前日法使來訪｀係關於其他事務｀有所商談｀與中法商約事｀並無重要商洽云｀又悉｀孔氏近日在滬｀各項公務極爲忙碌｀故日内將不離滬｀至是否將在滬度年｀據孔氏昨向記者表示｀則稱尚未能完全確定云｀</p>

<p>第七回　　語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請柬投靠情殷</p>
<p>李士廉見桌上有烟捲，順便拿了一根，抽了起來。在這個當兒，他臉上很不自然的，放下一層笑容，對賈多才道：多才兄，我們總算是好朋友，在我絶對没有辦法的時候，你也不能不帮我一點忙。我原來是想着，在南方找事，總是粥少僧多，弄不到個好位置像西北一帶，人家是不來的，我就冐險跑了來</p>
<p>不想到這裏以後，才知道人同此心，在這裏候缺的可也不少。我要回去，以前是摇旗呐喊的來了，頗覺得没有臉子見人。要找事呢不知何日可以擠上前去，眞閙得進退兩難。現在是開發西北之期，建設廳方面｀用人最多，你旣和高廳長認識，可不可以和我找一條出路呢？賈多才道：你的目的很大呀，恐怕我的身分，不够保薦你的資格吧？李士廉手裏拿了烟捲，不住的彈灰，另一隻手，撲撲頭髮，又摸摸下巴，笑道：我倒是不拘名義，無論什麽事，幹個周年半載，能解决目前的生活，也就行了。譬如就談到汽車吧？現在公路方面，應當有汽車管理局。賈多才道：你想幹局長嗎？李士廉笑道：那如何能够？能在局長之下，弄個分局幹幹，於願足矣！賈多才道：管汽車，自然是辦運貨載客這些事了，你幹過這個嗎？李士廉抬了兩抬肩膀，笑道：這也用不着要幹過的人才能幹呀。誰是交通大學畢業的去當鐵道部長，誰是農業大學畢業的，去當實業部長？作官混差事，要幹過學過，才能去幹，那人才就要發生恐慌了。我大大小小，也幹過三四年稅務，我就没有研究過什麽財政經濟學。（一○一）</p>
<h3 id="c196">足球瑣話 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>冬天氣候雖冷，但冷不透球迷的心！祇要逢到足够過癮的足球比賽，球塲四週仍是擁擠得熱氣騰騰的！</p>
<p>我認爲這是一種好現象。「提倡體育」這類「官冕」的話我們固不敢說｜其實也不必說｜但比之上舞塲，跑狗塲，回力球塲，雖說同是消遣，性格却顯得高雅得多！</p>
<p>我在「看足球」所化掉的金錢和時間，統計起來佔有可觀的數字，因此我也博得「球迷」這個徽號。</p>
<p>在樂華鼎盛時代，某星期六的下午因爲要去看球而告假不准，竟自偷偷地溜到申園，寗可過足了癮，回去吃上司的「排頭」，却不願奉公守法的在辦公室做熱鍋上的螞蟻！</p>
<p>提起樂華，使我在無限慨歎中感到不勝景慕之情。大概因爲「天下大勢，合久必分」的緣故！樂華是早就「散夥」了！虧得東華承繼而起，否則我們這批球迷定是一個個脫癮而死的。</p>
<p>在「術」的一方面說，東華不見得輸給樂華；但樂華要比東華「硬」些。樂華所以不能稱爲「全材」的球隊，因爲它始終没有得到足够勝任「翼」的人材。東華雖有「翼」，僅有「術」而欠「硬」，二者都嫌不够！</p>
<p>一般球迷的心理，「對外」倒似乎是一致的！大都希望多贏外國人幾只球。假使中國球員能多打幾個「檻子」使外國人多栽幾個「狗吃屎」的觔斗，也是值得拍手引爲笑樂的。可是「對内」却就分有許多派别！有捧東華的，也有捧優游的；就拿本季「西聨」東華優游兩隊的比賽而言，看客的情勢比之在球塲上角逐的球員就緊張得多！我認爲喊幾聲「好」助助興倒未始不是人情所許；但遇到雙方球員表演己嫌過火的時候，看客竟會一聨串的大聲喊「打」！一若非得於看球之餘再看一塲「摔角」不足快意，寗非怪事！</p>

<p>— 沈宇</p>
<p>我鄉習俗，於結婚之夜｜當新郎新娘行參拜禮後，例有吃「暖堂夜飯」之舉。</p>
<p>自然囉，這是一幕趣劇。當這趣劇將展開的時候，大概總由幾位慣會打趣的朋友，邊擠在己擁滿着娘兒們和孩子的新房裏向新郎新娘没遮没攔地嬉謔着，邊强要求新郎須携着新娘的手到客堂來吃「暖堂夜飯」。於是男的，女的，村的，俏的，都擁着「一對玉人」朝客堂而來</p>
<p>這時候客堂的正中，早放好兩雙連拼在一起的杉木檯子，這檯子上放着八隻精美的肴饌，當「一對玉人」在那兩把面南的大椅上分左右坐下後，其餘的位子，便由幾位慣會打趣的朋友陪坐着。</p>
<p>這樣，「暖堂夜飯」就開始了。</p>
<p>首先，靠新郎最近的賓客，站起來給新郎新娘篩一杯酒，跟着舉箸箝了這樣那樣的菜敬給新郎；但有時候新郎往往推辭而不「領情」，於是敬的人得想法着：及至新郎吃了爲止。</p>
<p>漸後，便挨到第二位，第三位，····直到陪坐的人全挨到了，那「暖堂夜飯」纔告完畢。</p>
<p>不過，從開始到完畢這一段時間，往往延長到有三四小時之久，因爲每一個陪坐的賓客，得想出一個方法｜｜是一個使新郎新娘覺得羞答答很够回味的玩意兒，要求新郎新娘依着這麽辦；要是不的話，便寗願久持着，及至照辦纔罷　　　　以上所說，便是我鄉習俗｜「暖堂夜飯」的一般的素描。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>有時候，也許這些藥恰好和病人所害的病有幾分相對。再加病人自己的心理作用，便容易見效了。這樣偶然的見效了幾次，人們便把多數不見效的一概歸諸天命，以爲大仙實在是了不得的。</p>
<p>就是太后這一位日理萬幾的女政治家，老實說，對此也具有很頑固的信心；可是我呢，在未曾獲得充分的實證之前，却委實不敢妄信。</p>
<p>「讓我們來隨便設一個假想，太后，」我一時忽然大發獃氣，忘了一切的顧忌說道：「假使那仙方是求到了，而且己配好藥，給」</p>
<p>病人喝下去了：然而這些藥實在是和病人的病不合的，譬如熱病而用了熱藥，寒症而用了凉藥，這豈不是對於病人非常危險的嗎？萬一闖了大禍，這便怎麽樣呢」？</p>
<p>太后平常對於别人總是很容易着惱的，對於我，却特别的優待，從無疾言厲色，總是特别的寛容；這時，聽我發出了這樣一個奇怪的（其實是很合理的）問題，便忍不住大怒起來了。</p>
<p>「你怎敢如此胡言亂語！」伊紅着臉，大聲的斥責我。</p>
<p>我也立刻懊悔起來了，雖然我的意思是對的，但太后所信仰的事物，我怎能隨便加以指摘呢？我們對於伊照例是只能像小孩子對於父母一般的一味盲目的服從，不該有什麽懷疑的，而我竟敢公然的對伊表示異議，這顯然是膽大極了；要是伊不高興的話，隨便什麽處罰，都可以加到我身上來的。我想到了這一點，不由慌得手足無措了。（二一一）</p>
<h3 id="c200">舊貨擔 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>上海的舊貨擔，和北平的打鼓的一樣，都是收買破舊的東西。他們的不同，不過打鼓的敲着鼓，他們用口喝罷了。</p>
<p>住在上海的人，没有不感覺到房租的昻貴。爲了節省經濟起見，不得不住極小的房子。那些無用的廢物，像報紙和舊瓶舊罐等，抛掉覺得可惜，留着却没有地方擺。舊貨擔，就收買這種東西。别人不要的，他却願收買，所以就能用極低的價格，去收買這些東西。</p>
<p>舊貨擔的起源，也許就是這樣起來的。但到了後來，他們的生意却逐漸擴大了。有些無用的舊東西，當然給他們收買去。到了經濟窘迫的時候，携着東西到當鋪裏去，終不十分雅觀，並且有許多東西，當鋪還不願接受，於是就賣給舊貨擔，好在賣給他們的時候，别人不會加以注意的，舊貨擔遇到這種生意，就竭力的周旋，不要失去這個好買賣。若是一個人的財力不足的時候，他們會聨合了幾個人，合力收買。</p>
<p>舊貨擔是有總會的。他們買到了東西，自己去改造一下。把舊的做成新的，壞的修補好，然後把這種東西拿到總會去出賣。在那兒有許多老主顧，他們是專門收買舊東西的。</p>
<p>我是一個書癖，閒來也走走舊貨總會，得到一兩本自己需要的書。但有時也有很意外的發見，像無意中能買到許多全套的雜誌。</p>
<p>和舊貨擔交易，無論買進賣出，論價是件極麻煩的事。他們在收買的時候，會指出那件東西的許多缺點，做减低價目的張本。但出賣的時候，又能指出許多優點，便可以提高他的價錢。但他們却少傲慢的脾氣，在可能範圍内，總可成交的。</p>

<h3 id="c201">無業闊民 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 張枕綠</p>
<p>常有人說：「上海滿地裏舖着黄金，祇等人去彎腰拾取便了。」農村鄉鎭的人大批地給舟車裝到上海來，就爲了惑於這種流言，想實現他們的黄金迷夢；結果，却祇是街頭添了幾許流浪的人兒，報端格外多些姦拐的材料罷了！雖然，這個無奇不有的都市裏，確也有好多旣無恒産又無恒業的人，居然能安坐而食，生活裕如，像我所要記述的人。我爲佩服他們有闊人之闊，遂錫以嘉名曰：「無業闊民」</p>
<p>某年，我家遷居到某里，我每晚聽得貼鄰的雀戰聲和無綫電聲，對我的文字工作大施打擊，祇有敢怒而不敢言。「和爲貴，先王之道，」這不是我善讀破句，實在聖哲遺訓，太與世故人情適合了！但看，隔壁那位孫家嫂嫂，没幾次與我妻搭話，漸相熟識；連我也不久便認識了那所謂孫先生者，甚至有時也被邀加入雀戰之局。我於是祇得忍住隠痛，以守睦鄰的美德。不過我因此知曉也他家的生活狀况，這一點算是損害賠償了罷。</p>
<p>他家租着兩宅相連的單幢石庫門，化掉一點裝修費用，把房屋分租給人，所以兩宅屋子裏住下了一十六家！這個住宅區域有很經濟的支配方法，可供逐户分租使用，現在公開宣佈那每宅區分如下：客堂連天井，天井上搭玻璃天棚，爲一户，客堂背後攔一小間爲一户，其上搭擱，就梯半接步出入，爲一户，前樓一户，後樓一户，樓擱一户，竃間樓｜俗稱亭子間｜一户，其頂原是曬檯，搭造木屋爲一户。竃間公用。樓梯頭及樓窗外做晾曬的地位。道兩宅内共十六户，餘他家自用客堂前樓一户地位外，每月共可收入房租一百三四十元，他家付出房租房捐和電燈費共計不足九十元，於是每月得坐賺四五十元了。</p>
<p>他家夫婦二人之外，有二個孩子和一個女傭，共計五名口；人數旣少，一間前樓很够起居之用。這兩宅内十五户的三房客，男女雜沓，當然有很多人有空聞工夫，要尋一點娱樂消閒方法，所以孫家的無綫電收音機發生了很强的力量，吸引同居人進房近聽。孫家嫂嫂再也和氣不過，招待來衆手談一局，殷勤供給捲烟和消閒果子之類，祇在牌局中抽一點取不傷廉的頭錢，也很爲同居所樂就。孫先生的朋友又多，（可見其好客有孟嘗君風味）每有借打牌以聨絡感情，或含其他副作用，除了也有專注意於賭博輸　的。</p>
<p>孫先生雖無職業，却有交際的天才，凡與一面者莫不被引爲知己。他的向外發展的能耐，倘是用在事業上，當能得到很美滿的成績了！不過他不做事業，那他的身子不受任何拘束，要比常人上而至於國府主席｜優遊舒服多了！他逢到廢曆的節邊，包下一家戲園子的日戲，借一個什麽好聽的名義，分頭派銷戲券；好在他的朋友很多，銷券總有相當的成績。他每次舉行這上海人所謂「打抽豐」的勾當，可以弄到少則三四百多至七八百元。</p>
<p>孫先生的孝道又是給朋輩所樂道的。他每年總要替他亡故的爹媽，有時更及光祖考妣，做上一二次隂壽和幾週忌的紀念典禮。他發下帖子請人家去吃一餐，人家好意思不送一點禮澤？於是，紀念祖先的結果，孫先生的腰包裏又可裝進幾百元。</p>
<p>這幾項規定的收入，一年内己有四五千元了，他家的開支自然不必依賴恒業的收入，可以很足够，而且塲面也很闊綽了。這位孫先生不屑效尤那班白相人的「講斤頭」，（該討人），取道進賬，在人格方面，果然此賢於彼多多哩</p>

<h3 id="c237">憂鬱的文學 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 企</p>
<p>薩爾蒂柯夫·錫且特林（saltikovshch）ekrin）在一篇呌做「我縣的一日」的sketfh裏說：</p>
<p>「寫甚麽呢？謳歌甚麽偉業呢？没有偉業｜那地方祗有憂鬱的平凡，没有英雄｜他們的地方被那些爲恐佈而顫慓的人們所占住了｜我怎麽辦好呢？很明白地，我祇好和諸君一同悲慟，做一個歎息的年代記作者····但這是怎樣困難呀！·····世界是悲慘慘的，我和他一同悲歎，世界歎息｜我也和牠一同歎息，而且我還要請讀者來和我一同悲歎。」</p>
<p>這寥寥數語道破了舊俄文學的最大的特點。在沙皇統治的隂鬱條件之下，俄國生活的創傷的記述成了文學作品的主要内容。不管是哥果爾，柴霍夫的刺諷與幽默，或屠格湼夫的抒情的調子和朶斯退益夫斯基的細察毫毛的心理的解剖，都帶着隂暗憂鬱的影子和沈重的哀傷的感覺。</p>
<p>布蘭克斯（georgebrandes）在一篇評論屠格湼夫的文章裏說：「屠格湼夫的憂鬱實質上是在缺陷和悲劇面的斯拉夫人種的憂鬱，是斯拉夫民謡的憂鬱的正統後裔。···哥果爾的憂鬱是由絶望而來的。當朶斯退益夫斯基表現同樣憂鬱的時候，是因爲他的心對那些被踐踏的人們和大罪人表同情。託爾斯泰的憂鬱是以他的宗教命運論爲基礎。」</p>
<p>我們讀了這些作家的作品的時候，就常爲他們的憂鬱的氣分所感染。這憂鬱並不是「懷春悲秋」式的愉悅的感傷，而是一種被周圍的混沌和隂暗所壓倒那樣的苦重的心境。作者有時用笑對待你，但那種笑却並不是輕鬆的，而是一種悽慘的笑。所謂tearsthrdnghlaugbter便是哥果爾和柴霍夫的藝術的特色。</p>
<p>哥果爾在一伊凡·伊凡諾維支怎樣和伊凡·尼契復羅維支相駡起來的」裏，對地主官僚的醜態盡了譏誚之能事，使你看了無論怎樣也忍不住要笑的。這故事開頭完全是一篇笑劇（merryfarce）,但到末尾却也籠罩了憂鬱的空氣，而用了下面這樣特徴的句子結束：「這世界上隂鬱得很呢，先生們。」倍林斯基（belinsdy）說哥果爾的作品「永遠透出憂傷抑鬱的情感一，是並非過言的。</p>
<p>柴霍夫的憂鬱也曾經一時地風靡了俄國的文壇。不知多少的讀者傳染了「柴霍夫式的情緒」。他的「隂慘的故事」中的主人公對於自己，對於灰色的現實生活，對於周圍的那些庸俗卑微的人們的失望悲觀，正是「柴霍夫式的情緒」的反映。他的戲劇，如有名的「櫻桃園」「萬尼亞舅舅一等，都同樣地洋溢着隂鬱，頽喪，消沉的情緒。</p>
<p>俄國的作家雖然被周圍世界的黑暗和醜惡所窒息，在他們的臉上起了憂鬱的痙攣，但是對未來光明的渴望和追求，却像不滅的火一樣，永遠在他們心裏燃燒，這就是俄國文學的最偉大的地方。就在柴霍夫的隂鬱的作品中，也可以看出對煇煌的未來生活的曙光的憧憬。「三姊妹」裏的威爾希說出了下面這樣的話：「再過兩三百年，這人世的生活大概會成爲耀目地美麗和燦爛吧。」</p>
<p>但是在柴霍夫所豫期的還要快十倍以上，不到二三十年，柴霍夫所夢想的「美麗和燦爛」的生活己經在地上實現了。在今日俄國的文學裏所反映出來的，自然也不再是「憂鬱的平凡」，而是眞正的「英雄」和「偉業」了。</p>
<h3 id="c238">昆明（上） <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>｜地方印象記｜</p>
<p>没有到過雲南的人，一提起雲南來，總覺得有些害怕：彷彿是那地方在得很遠，又野蠻，又有毒瘴。從來没有人敢去，去了便會死！所以從前連被徴兵着的新豐老翁，一聽見隊伍要開到雲南去，寗願就抱起一塊石頭來將肐膊扎斷，不願隨着隊伍去送死！</p>
<p>這種對雲南的恐怖和成見，歷來就很厲害的。其實，雲南何嘗像他們所想像的那般？｜</p>
<p>雲南是有牠的特殊風味的，在這滿是龎大的高山，和原始一般的大自然界中，雖然有些顯得蠻荒獷悍，但却有不少你想像不到的「山靑水秀」的地方。</p>
<p>譬如昆明吧？你想牠是一個什麽地方呢？</p>
<p>牠是一個躱在深山裏，還没有被人發見的美人，雖然打扮有些不大入時，但也儘够你陶醉了。</p>
<p>當一個旅人，帶着那末一副疲乏的身體，孤零零的給滇越車帶到了昆明時，牠會給你甜蜜的温存，好像就是你久别了的情婦一樣。隨着你的喜歡，牠無不使你滿意。</p>
<p>你若是一個都市的崇拜者，你到了昆明，你不會覺得牠一點都市的氣息也没有！在遒裏有着整齊的西式商店，寛闊平坦的馬路，汽車，黄包車，脚踏車，不絶的往來着；趕熱閙似的人們，那麽擁擠的走在街的兩邊。馬路兩旁的商店，陳列着耀人眼目的商品，留聲機的清音，不斷的從掛着廉價招牌的商店裏播送出，顯得那麽怪熱閙的。</p>
<p>從白天到夜晚，老是擠着一堆人的地方，是没有悲哀的遊戲塲裏。這裏有着一個有聲電影院和無聲電影院，戲院也是有着一個唱京戲的和唱滇戲的。除此，還有許多唱板櫈戲的小茶圜，那是只要泡上一壼茶，就可以坐着聽聽的。</p>
<p>奢華的大酒館，清雅的咖啡店，這地方也具備得有，可惜只没有女招待，不然，很够一般花花公子們樂意了。</p>
<p>昆明也有着好像上海的霞飛路似的那末一條路，這幽靜的地方，都是外國人的住屋和旅店，地臨盤龍江旁，到了晚上，你慢步走在江岸上，看看這慢悠悠流着的江水，和對面房裏帶着吸引人的魔力，明亮地映在水上的電燈光，眞够有味兒！</p>
<p>你若嫌這太單調，不合你愛風景的理想，那你不妨去到翠湖走走吧？那地方就在昆明市的西北邊，五華山，圓通山，貢院坡，突立在牠的周圍，環湖是一條清澈的小河，湖裏有着兩條滿植着綠柳的長堤，因這兩堤的互相交义，全湖劃分成爲四部分。在那交义點處，是有名的海心亭，勿論哪一天，你在這裏可以看見許多男男女女扶在攔杆上，悠閒的擲着炒米糖，在欣賞池裏遊來遊去的魚。</p>
<p>久在昆明，你若覺得白天趟街一點味道也没有，那你不妨晚上出去。夜裏的昆明是有些特殊風味的。頂好你到文明街趟趟那些古董攤上去：那裏夜來是很熱閙的。各種東西都賣得有，白天你在街上買不到的東西，只要夜裏到那裏去，就可以買得到。不過，請你注意：常常有許多「油子」拿着一件東西在假賣給擺古董的人，擺古董的人也故意給他（或她）一個大價錢，可是賣的人還有點不肯，兩方於是在那裏忸忸怩怩的爭持着。這時，假若你不明白那勾當，以爲擺古董的人都肯給他（或她）那樣一個價錢，那東西必定是很值價的，就冒冒失失的多增他幾文錢，那你一定要上當的。</p>
<p>昆明人就有這許多姦詐的本領，可是這就是他們吃大虧的地方，他們只顧目前，不顧將來，什麽事都以爲只要欺騙得去就行了。</p>
<p>因着生活環境的影響，昆明人的性質多是很懦弱。女子是不用說，許多男子都是連出門也不敢出，一生只是死守在家裏。他們愛虚榮，愛裝門面子，不管什麽人，女的總得叫太太，男的總得叫老爺，他們不管有吃無吃，但面子是不能不講究。即使到了靠着女兒賣淫來過活的那一境，他們的門面依然還是那末裝得很漂亮的。</p>
<h3 id="c239">從火山歸來（七） <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>她們走後，我仍然一個人留在火口邊，憑弔那不知名姓的異國的靑年男子，他們這些爲情而犧牲的英勇戰士！</p>
<p>從噴火口裏　出來的烟，起初像火車頭上初開動時噴出來的黑烟一般的吐···吐···地往上冲，以後慢慢地上昇濃的黑烟變成了一縷縷的灰色的雲，最後灰色的雲也慢慢地淡得没有了。</p>
<p>火口周圍有三十多丈那麽大，深是没有人知道的。去年讀賣新聞社組織的火山探險團只到半途，因爲没有空氣，而火山又在爆炸待發的時候，就不能前進了。他們是曾經看見過許多粉身碎骨的靑年男女的，我雖然不能見到那悲慘的死，然而從張着血泚的火山口看來，知道牠己經呑嚙了不少有爲的靑年男女了。</p>
<p>人，也許誰都有所謂良心的吧？即使是個理智像鐵一般的人，平時反對情死，反對自殺！駡他們是弱者，没有出息的！而一走到火山來，誰都將咀咒變成憐憫，將厭惡變成憐愛，誰都有這麽一個念頭：「來這兒自殺的人眞是勇敢，偉大。」</p>
<p>本來，自殺的人是爲了生活的没有辦法，或者感到生之厭倦，失戀，失業之後不能再忍受苦痛，才下决心在極短的時間裏，了結他的生命，得到永久的解脫。而來到火山自殺的人就不同了！他們必須經過一夜航海的擁擠生活，經過四十餘里的山途，跋涉之勞，踏遍了廣漢無垠的沙漠，踏遍了峥　可怕的溶岩，然後將生命送給火山做祭禮，肉血横飛，體無完膚。他們爲什麽不服毒，不跳海？死前要受這多磨難，這多苦痛，未免有點太傻了吧？</p>
<p>守火口的巡警告訴我們：「跳火山的人多半在下午的黄昏時候，上午是很少有的。又說：「今天還没有看到跳火山的。」這話的意思是說前幾天己有人跳下去了。</p>
<p>在火口的最高處，掛着一塊圓的反光鏡，從裏面可以看到無限深的山义葺讀賣新聞社探險的紀念碑，也就在這鏡的附近。</p>
<h3 id="c240">新星 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>新星這兩個字我們是常見到的，在新捧角文字上，在電影廣告上，在無綫電節目上。可是這些都是修辭上的借代玩意，眞的新星，我們不常見說起，在天上，也許幾十年不發現一顆新星。自然老是呆板板的，不像人爲的新星，可以隨意創造。這樣天上的新星，當然不能像人間的新星常在人耳目；可是正因其少見，該比稱濫了的新星遠爲希罕罷。</p>
<p>新星一稱暫星，中國稱爲客星，三個名稱中，似乎暫星一稱較妥當些。因爲客星似乎是說這星從别處走來又走向别處去，這與事實不合。新星似乎是說突然産生，而且就此在天上增加一顆，其實凡是新星，在發現前固早己存在，光明後仍要消失，一顆新星並不能永久燦爛下去，用新星比擬人，實際是帶點不吉之兆的。暫星是說忽然明亮一下，由非肉眼星到成爲肉眼星，又消失下去，就我們見來爲暫，至於星之爲星，則我門不易究跡。所以這仍不是科學的稱法。就現在的天文學講，則依畢克靈的分類法，牠是變光星第一類。</p>
<p>變光星在現代天文學的重要，幾可說無可比倫。定星團星雲的遠近是用仙王式變光星；定雙星的軌道可用蝕變星；而長週期變星則喑示星辰是如何發展，而新星尤爲參考的好資料。變光星的海獸。是最可以帮助我們了解新星的，這顆星在最亮的時候，是頗亮的二等星，最暗時則到十等，我們的肉眼，是六等星就不易看到的，因之這顆星在我們眼中，也是忽隠忽現，不過他約以三百三十日的週期回復，我們很可以放心他不致消失罷了。</p>
<p>新星是更極端的例，最光亮的曾有達到金星的光度，最暗也許到二十一等（遠鏡所見星等的限度）也許到完全暗黑。有没有週期，生命與歷史都很短促的人類，現尚無法回答。但以前的新星却有消失後現在還見其作一微星居原來的位置，大概總有天文家時或訪問他一下，也許一天發現他重見光明而給我們解决一個疑問的。</p>
<p>普通的說法，大致認新星的突然燦爛，是由於受外力壓逼，致於爆炸（二十五日路透電關於新星的消息，也是這樣說的。）爆炸後的命運就是死滅。這也是頗可引致我們的遐想，他到無光無力之後，或者會被那致他爆炸的力攝引了去，而漸漸變成一顆行星，而終於有一天在上面産生了生物，這一切我們將永遠不能知道，時間太長了。</p>
<p>電訊報告這次發現的新星，遠在一千五百光年外，並說他的燦爛，遠在羅馬帝國傾覆之時。這己可表示時間之長了，但再一千五百年，他也還不會死滅呢。關於一千五百光年遠這數字，似可有疑問，因現在似無法定一單個的星的遠度爲千光年以上。</p>
<p>這顆新星的所在，據電是大力星座，大概卽現在譯作武仙星座的。這星座，在我們的緯度上，十二月裏，晚六時就己沉下西北，晨六時才由東北上升，就不是這幾天連接天隂，我們也未必有機會見到。不然，武仙星座内本無明星，忽然有顆明星，凡認識星的人都可發現的。在英國不也是業餘天文家發現的嗎？何以天文臺不先發現的呢？那是因爲天文家大致用遠鏡搜索遠空，只見極小的一角，其注意整個天空的機會，遠比業餘者要少。假定今天天空有一顆遠鏡新星而不知在那一點，也許用遠鏡搜索經年，也尋不出着的呢。</p>

<h3 id="c281">英皇招宴貧人 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 朝佼</p>
<p>報載英皇於耶誕節招宴貧人七百人於白教堂中。據說這是每年一定的規例。英皇招宴貧人，這是一個多麽有趣的消息。英皇是在英國社會上所被認爲一個最崇高最尊貴的人物，而所謂七百個貧人也者，雖不是都是貧到甚至於無立錐之地的貧人（我想若眞是貧到甚至無立錐之地的貧人，事實上也不至於會十分榮幸地被英皇招宴的，被英皇招宴的貧人，雖說貧，但也總有些兒雖說不犬而總有些兒相當小小的來歷的罷。不然，被招宴的貧人，何獨只止於這七百人呢），但也總是一些窮乏得非常利害的所謂貧人罷。這七百個一向是窮得非常利害的貧人，一旦忽與那麽一個一向被人稱爲最崇高最尊貴的英皇叙在一處，當面對酌（可是不是當面對酌，還成問題，也許英皇派個巴代表，招宴這些襤褸不堪的窮人，也未可知），握手言歡（？），你想，這該是一個多麽可以榮幸的事啊。</p>
<p>然而我們却有覺得十分可惜的，那便是這次（年年如此）英皇所垂寵開恩招宴的所謂貧人，可惜只限於七百人，而且，招宴只限於一次。七百個貧人以外的其他的許許多多貧人（英國有失業者三百萬人），怎樣使他們都能在這次招宴中光邀恩寵，而且，就是這次能被招宴的貧人，每年每日都能够吃到英皇所賜的那一頓十分豐富的酒食呢？這可得就成了一個十分嚴重而且十難解决的問題了。</p>
<p>英皇可以在每年耶誕節，置備一些不甚豐富（據我想，大概不會怎樣豐富罷）的酒菜，邀一小部份窮人赴宴，然而他却不能把更多些的麵包，分給一些更廣大的失業羣衆都能吃到。這是一個十分可惜的事件。英皇將怎樣用什麽方法使一般貧人都能只是吃到粗黑的麵包就够呢？這是一個很可討論的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c282">車夫張福生 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 百揚</p>
<p>故鄉己經通行黄包車了，這是我早己知道了的；不過除了一條大道免强可以應付橡皮車輪之外，其餘的小路平時坐在轎子裏還是覺得摇搖欲墜的樣子，所以我以爲坐黄包車的僅僅是幾位鄉紳子弟在大街上出出風頭的；但是，當我提着行囊，踏下車站的時候，被一羣蜂似的黄包車夫圍住了，舉眼向前望去，沿路兩旁排着近百輛車子。這出乎我意料之外，看到這樣的排塲，大概外鄉人走一步踣三次的小路都己經改善了是無疑的。不然，黄包車公司對於車輛所負的損失太大了，而且這近百輛車子的生意何所出呢。</p>
<p>當我呆立着的時候，突然一隻巨大</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的手掌搶住了我的行囊，同時「少爺」的呼聲不知從那一個車夫口中送出來。</p>
<p>我的眼綫無可奈何索巨臂而上，原來是一個矮小的莊稼模樣的人，看見了他那張鼻子和眉毛幾乎聨在一起的　臉我清楚的記得他民是我小學校里的同學張福生。這時候那羣車夫見生意己被人接去，向第二個來賓圍攻去了。</p>
<p>張福生接了我的行囊，像吩咐咐的說：</p>
<p>少爺這里來」！</p>
<p>彷彿猴子一樣的竄出車站木栅，在一輛車子的脚墊上放好了東西，就蹲在兩條車槓的中間專等我坐上車去。</p>
<p>我坐上他車子的時候，他舉起車槓來呼哨了一聲，似乎向他的同伴們示威，拔腿向前奔了。</p>
<p>這條開展在車站前的小路，兩旁本來都是田畝，種田人爲了戽水時的便利，沿路都是挖大了的缺口，而且路旁有幾株大樹的樹根，像山脈似的伸展在路中。如果黑夜里走路，一個不小心就是冲進了稻田，跌得滿身污泥。現在這幾株巨大的老樹己被砍去，缺口也塡平了，自然阻礙行人的樹根也不見了，所以雖不及上海的柏汕馬路，也不致連人帶車衝進稻田的危險了。</p>
<p>福生拉車特别快，他己經搶在最前的一輛了，而前面的路比較漸漸狹窄，我不覺脫口喊了：</p>
<p>「福生，慢慢的拉」。</p>
<p>福生對於一個外鄉人能够喊得出他的名字，當然驚奇起來，很快的收住了車，回過頭來問：</p>
<p>「少爺是本地人？」</p>
<p>「不認識我嗎？我們同在××小學讀過書的。」</p>
<p>於是他放慢了脚步，幾次回過頭來端詳我，終於說：</p>
<p>「年數太多了，記不起少爺呌什麽名字！」</p>
<p>「不錯，你比我高一班，當時聽說你由學校里包送到高小去的？」我就絮絮的和他談起來了。</p>
<p>「噢，我記起了。」他說：「少爺呌朱××吧。｜校長送我到高小里，祗是第一年免費，第二年家里交不出費，我爹就不要我讀書了。那時我家這有幾畝自種田，田里本來要請人帮種的，我帮着也搭半工人工，可是近幾年來眞是倒霉·····</p>
<p>車子己到了分路口，他向西轉了灣，重問我：</p>
<p>我回說了「是的。」他又接下去說：</p>
<p>「近年來田里收不起我幾畝田賣了，反帮人種田。現在新米上塲，空着就出來拉拉車子賺幾個錢。｜少爺在上海發財？」</p>
<p>他似乎等着我的回答，不說話了。但是我没有回答他，雖然他二次回過頭注視我的面孔。</p>
<p>車到家，我付了車錢，心頭覺得被濃霧一般的悲哀壓逼着。</p>

<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>是個初冬的黄昏｜</p>
<p>天像頽廢的人兒的臉，這末灰沉沉地吻着遠處的樹梢。</p>
<p>風怪有勁地帶着没人承管的落葉在秋收後的田坂上跑。</p>
<p>那條通到鎭裏去的石路，在蒼茫裏翻着魚肚色。就在路的角予上豎着丈多高的寫有趙家莊常備隊字樣的大纛，那還是徴兵後才竪的，它十分自負地在風聲裏咆哮着，似乎它有保護這村治安的使命。</p>
<p>那四圍是幾十間平房和樓房組成的趙家莊。從它的外表上估計着，它總該看着同治皇帝登基吧。這時每家的烟突裏正冐着放信號似的炊烟，幾個頭上蒙着藍布的村婦，都拉直了喉嚨在路角裏喊自己男人和兒子的名字；於是披藍布大褂的農夫和拖着鼻涕的牧童，像奉召似地，縮着　子，從小橋那邊踱進面河的白板門裏。</p>
<p>幾個從三里外鎭上趕市回來的小販，像天平架似地在魚肚色的大路上移動，他們躭心母親和妻子在等着他吃夜飯，可是看看擔上還剩着許多没賣完的橘子；香焦，糖，餅····怕交賬不出似的順道在每家簷前用百倍的宣傳力呌喊着，那含有誘惑性的聲浪牽動一羣剛從學校裏回來的小孩，他們都用黑溜溜的目光在揀那一担好，那一隻大，那一個没爛，經過幾次生意上的爭執，才用較廉的代價滿足了雙方的慾望。</p>
<p>小孩散光了，摸摸腰包重了許多，於是脚頭頓時輕鬆起來，一個個又天平架似地向另一條小路上抄去。</p>
<p>蘆葦裏響着船上人的喉嚨，那個剛從水裏碌起來披着光身棉襖的漁夫，正提着酒瓶坐在船頭上呷着。拖着髮髻的漁婦，忙碌地在艙裏整理一天的收獲。幾個從外面辛辛苦苦賺錢回來的出門人，在埠頭裏躬着身子和他們還魚和蟹的價錢，一八三八覺着心算裏便宜時，纔從貼肉的衣袋裏掏出一枚和兩枚的雙毫掉一串吹着白沫的蟹和甩着尾巴的河魚進去。</p>
<p>寗觀路末班車的喇叭聲尖厲地在黄昏的氣流裏激盪着，接着引起一陣疏落的犬吠聲。</p>
<p>有幾個提着行李的旅客從二里外的站頭上回來。他們都帶着一顆愉快的心敲着自己家裏的門，他們都預備着一副出人意料的情緒給自己的心愛人受。</p>
<p>時間老人的筆添上比畫師更畢眞的夜色，四週靜靜地，黑暗吞没了趙家莊的一切。</p>

<p>— 曲江</p>
<p>奇巍的高加索山，雄據着歐亞二洲的要道，那處是四方的集中點，有一百餘種族的人民，部落主義與帝國主義並駕着，這就是布而希維領袖史太林的發源地。</p>
<p>喬其亞（georgia）地地里羅村中，有名diugashvili，伊家世世業農及鞋匠，到了農村使他們不能謀生的時期，djnagashvili家裏的vissarion，離開了他的故鄉，而飄流到接鄰的哥列村（ogri），充某鞋廠裏的工人。</p>
<p>vissraion的妻子，是一個喬其亞的女性，名呌ekaterina；喬其亞的婦女，在十三四歲的時候便結婚，因爲她們比普通女子成熟得早，一到三十五歲，己是衰老了；所以ekaterrna很早就做母親，繼續生了三個孩子，可是不久都殤逝了；第四個孩子快要在聖誕節前後降臨。她是一個熱心基督教的女子，她祝上帝賜給她一個養得長大的兒子，她預先將這孩子取名爲joseph。</p>
<p>Joseph史太林在一八七九年十二月二十一日呱呱墮地，ekaterina這時方才二十歲。她將史太林取小名爲瑣瑣（soso）。「瑣瑣」原是喬其亞一種玩爱動物的名稱。ekaterina對於這孩子籌着很大的計畫，且抱着熱烈的雄心，她竟希望「瑣瑣」成爲將來的世界大偉人。</p>
<p>史太林的前途，是深蒙着他母親影響的；他的父親不過一個掘笨的鞋匠，但他的母親，却是一個非常的女子，她具着極堅强的毅力，她决心要兒子將來任牧師的職位。</p>
<p>史太林的襁褓時代，是在哥列村度的。哥列是喬其亞的首都，又是風景秀美的地方，它的中等學校，在那邊要　第一了，所以它也可以稱爲教育的中心。</p>
<p>「瑣瑣」出世一年之前，俄土戰爭方才告終；俄王亞力山大第二在聖彼得城被剌的時候，瑣瑣祇有十五個月的年齡；當高加索山反響着聨合土耳其叛俄的呼聲中，瑣瑣還是一個絲毫無能力的嬰兒。</p>
<p>　　Edaterina常誇着她自己的孩子；史太林在學校裏有優越的成績，他的態度也很好，所以頗得師長的愛重。但他的身體不很强壯，他的家境素來是清寒的，没有充分的食物滋養。七歲時曾出過一次天花。直到現在，面上還留有幾點痕跡呢！</p>
<p>「瑣瑣眞是一個好孩子，」他母親後來常鄭重的陳說道：「我從來不用責罰他，他讀書是極用功的。·····瑣瑣是我的獨子，難怪我過份的珍愛他。他民的父親祇希望他做一個良好的鞋匠，但是瑣瑣十一歲的時候，他也就去世了。我呢？我不要瑣做一個鞋匠，我却望他做牧師！」</p>
<p>史太林小學畢業時得到了獎學金，他幼年的生活無疑是刻苦的，自他父親過世，他母親賴着針綫生涯，勉强的維持生計，還要積蓄些錢充瑣瑣的教育費，可至這瑣瑣現在竟没有辜負了慈母的期望和心血咧！</p>

<h3 id="c291">好萊塢的一面臨時演員的悽慘情形 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>在攝影塲的門外，那裏站着一羣人，男女老少都有。他們之中，有從前雜要班的演員，己往的騎師，失敗的企業家，中國女郎，破落的富翁，叫化子等等，但是其中最傷心的，就是昔日的電影明星和喜劇演員，受了變動的電影潮流所淘汰下來的。他們都望穿了秋水，希望攝影塲的大門，能張開大嘴，將他們一齊吞進去。「運氣怎樣？」有人問着一個形容枯槁的少女。她笑了一笑道：「七個月來，只工作了一天。不過我亦慣於飢餓了。你看那個穿着藍絨布背心的人。我比他好得多了。我也記得他從前亦是一個進用人員的大經理哩。</p>
<p>我們都知道好萊塢是個金光燦爛的天堂。但是在它地面的下層，那裏沸騰着無數幽魂怨鬼。它們要攻破了黄金的地彀，將怨恨的溶岩，淹蓋了好萊塢的全境。那裏有一萬五千個臨時演員，他們的名字都在中央人員僱用所登記過的。叫他們是臨時演員，是寃枉他們的，因爲他們或者半年工作一天，或是永遠得不到工作。他們都在希望着｜生於希望，食於希望。但是倘使不叫他們是臨時演員，或是他們不自命爲臨時演員，他們就斷绝了一綫的希望，無力支持飢寒，在風風雨雨之中等待着天落的機緣了。攝影塲的大門，永遠是爲他們緊閉着。他們生於希望者，不久就要死於希望了。</p>
<p>好萊塢將怎樣處置這一班人衆？這種悲劇，是誰造成的？說來也很奇怪。這種悲劇是臨時演員們自己造成的。解决的方法，亦惟有請臨時演員們自己處理罷了。這一班人，受了經濟困難的壓迫，和失業的痛苦，一方面又耳食了許多好萊塢富庶浪費等等傳說，就大家哄到好萊塢來了。等到去到那裏，向中央僱用所掛了號。一日一日的過去。但是希望在越變越小，帶來的錢漸漸化完了，衣食無着了，房錢付不出來了。但是他們却不肯往别處去，還是希望着。至於公司方面，亦因爲經濟的關係，就减少了影片中的大塲面，就更减少了臨時演員的飯碗。以下所寫的，就是一家攝影門外的一幕悲劇：</p>
<p>一個靑年的臨時演員，從一家公司的招募股裏，垂頭喪氣地走了出來，渾進了其餘的臨時演員人羣之中，留連徘徊着不肯就去。「没有運氣嗎？」一個旁人間他。他說：「我己經得到了一件事，但是因爲我缺少一副眼鏡，他們又不要我了。買付眼鏡，至少要五塊錢，我那裏來那許多錢呢？」他說着不勝嘆息。後面一個老頭子，一言不發地將自己的眼鏡摘了下來，交給了那靑年道：「孩子，你拿去用。我没有眼鏡是看不見東西的，但是我可以坐在這裏等你。」那靑年趕緊伸手去接眼鏡，但是他聽見了老頭子所說的話，又將手縮了回去道：「那不興。你知道，我這一進去，說不定要到深夜才可以出來呢。」那老頭子道：「　要緊。你拿去吧。你不是餓了好幾天了嗎？我坐在那面弄堂口等你。」少年謝了進去了。那老頭子摸到衖堂口，坐了下來，一天不能動了，因爲他没有眼鏡是寸步難移的。天晚了，太陽下去了，冷風吹來，其寒剌骨。幸虧那少年過了八點鐘就回來。他向那老者抱歉道：一眞對不起。但是無論怎樣，我們晚飯有得吃了。」他欣然地替那老者戴上了眼鏡，扶着他一同到附近飯店裏去吃晚飯去了。</p>
<p>很平常的事，五六個臨時演員，擠着住在一問小屋子裏。等到公司裏要用一個人的時候，他們就忙了起來，你的衣服，我的鞋，他的領帶，凑集了來，就給了一個人，就派他去做代表。那人工作一天回來，大家就有飯吃了。其餘的人，没有褲子，没有衣服，没有鞋，坐在床上等着。兩位美貌女郎，居然在好菜塢附近鄉村野地上結幕而居起來，因爲她們没有房子住了。但是她們還是不斷地希望着。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c292">評「鴻運當頭」 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Happiness　Ahead</p>
<p>|大光明</p>
<p>這是一部應時的作品，當新年將要來臨的時候，這以快樂的新年爲題材的「鴻運當頭」便在人們快樂的情中開映了。</p>
<p>無疑的，這一部影片給與人們充分的輕鬆快感。如新年之夜在中國人開設的舞塲中，如在溜冰塲，如當男主人公在拭窗户歌唱的時候，都有很好的熱鬧空氣。這輕快熱鬧構成了劇的主要部份，劇作者或導演完成了他們使人們歡天喜地的目的。但是我們並不能因着這些忽視了作品的主題。</p>
<p>什麽是作品的主題？在資本主義高度發展的美國，工人們不能輕易的和一富家女郎結婚，自然是很普遍的現象｀這種現象並不使人怎樣滿意，於是他便使富家小姐反對母親代定的婚姻，不願和門當户對的少爺結婚，而偶然的愛上了一個勞作的靑年，｜｜清潔公司的小職員。在愛的方面，這是劇作者認爲合理的。但是他們的結合，不是没有條件的，那便是男主人公一定得有高尚的志願，由原來的地位拯力向上爬，自己開辦清潔公司。一定要他不取不義之財。一定要在富家小姐的心目中認爲他是一個gentleman。於是小姐請求父親帮助情人兩千元的資本，在誤會解釋之後，兩個不同地位的男女便結合起來了。</p>
<p>這一部戲在表現方法上，極力迎合觀衆的興趣，極力使劇情曲折離奇，但是小姐不肯向情人道出自己的身份，却是非常勉强的事，所以她租亞派脫門忒，她轉幾個灣交錢給情人，她的父親不肯向男主人公立刻承認自己是丈人，這些都是爲了做戲而做戲。</p>
<p>此外，女主角的演技也是不够老練的。</p>
<h3 id="c293">「飛花村」小事誌 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>當「飛花村」到臨平去拍攝外景的時候，鄭應時恐大家途中飢餓，故而從上海帶去了一大盒的蛋糕。誰料每個人吃了後，都腸痛如絞，險些兒闖出大禍來，故回來時，鄭應時遇人便說，「他媽的，險　兒被蛋糕把性命送掉。」這也是攝外景中一段奇怪的趣聞。</p>
<p>飾小華的陳娟娟，今年雖只是六歲。但聰敏過人，說一知十。當「牧羊女」歌收音時，頗受勝利唱片公司西人音樂團所激賞，頻呼之曰「小情人」。</p>
<p>「飛花村」劇中有一幕法庭塲面，鄭應時爲求劇情空氣之眞實計，一天特地趕到法庭去傍聽，恰巧那時候正在審問一件誘奸案，與他劇中的情節相脗合。故「飛花村」法庭一幕的空氣，就來得特别緊張而有力了。</p>
<p>近日北風凛冽中，「飛花村」曾經補拍了一塲戲，那便是高占非工作後洗澡的一幕了。高占非因此受冷，在寒熱交加中，約臥床旬日始起。</p>
<p>「飛花村」工作最緊張的時節，正是六月炎夏，但各部人員並不以天氣炎熱而停頓工作，因此中暑者日有數起，如秦桐曾經暈倒一次，車往紅十字會緊急醫治，始蘇醒過來。</p>
<p>史東山完成「女人」的那一天，恰得了一位千金，果然成績絶美。鄭應時完成「飛花村」的那一天，却得了一位麟兒，果然成績更優美。因此，同事中善幽默者如「生之哀歌」導演胡銳，常抱起凳子大呌曰：「望望天老爺，保佑阿拉那十多年不見的老婆子也早日生一貴子，扎扎阿拉的「生之哀歌」的台營吧｜」噱極。（却）</p>

<p>— 素華</p>
<p>唐爾納急急像要解釋的答道：「呵！是的，可是都太糊纒了，擺脫不得的。」他說到這裏就忽然停住了，蘇麗亞站了起來。他也跟着站了起來道：「你要我留在這裏嗎？」唐爾納勉强的笑道：「那是什麽話？」世界上什麽東西却不能使我離開你。」她接着道：「那麽我是會糊纒的，也許會擺脫不掉的，你又怎樣呢？」這可把唐爾納難倒了。他話也說不出。蘇麗亞心裏苦着駡道：「你所需要的，祇是菲菲，舞女罷了，你自命爲風流，可惜你連愛情都不懂得。」唐爾納可再忍不住了，他裝着鎭靜的樣了說道：「我請你不要破壞了今宵吧？」蘇麗亞聽了怒着道：「哼，破壞今宵嗎？我不會破壞你今宵的，你要你的快樂，你來這裏吧。」說着她就衝到外面，指着唐爾納向下面喊道：「你們聽好，這位先生今晚要你們陪伴他呢。繼着又向唐爾納說道；「她們都來了，都是你的今宵。明天不會麻煩你的。」說了就往下面跑，最後她又對唐爾納道：「我悔不早知你是這樣的人。」說完就出了麥茜。唐爾納跑到窗門望着她和她的車子在黑夜裏消失。他是失望了，在房間裏，把香檳酒一瓶一瓶的喝，口裏還念着菲菲。</p>
<p>己是第二天晚上了。在唐爾納住的旅館房間裏，柏夫大使突然蒞止，對他的僕人說，倘若不立刻找唐爾納來大使館，就要把他軍法從事。他的僕人急拿了的軍服，奔到麥茜去找他。房間裏滿倒着香檳酒瓶。他正睡得爛熟。叫他也不起來。他想關了門替他换衣服。過了一會，他的僕人竟給他摔了出來口裏還喊着：「他不肯脫衣服，」等在門外的一班女人，不期然的一哄往裏面衞進去。内衣，外衣，褲子，襪子等都從房間裏抛出來了。唐爾亞卒於給這一班人换了軍裝出來。但是他酒還没有醒，口裏還在說死也不情願因爲金錢就去娶那寡婦。他抵死也不肯到大使館。後來倒給那班女人一推一擁的放到車上，和着他到大使館去。車子到了，那時大使館己經很混亂，大使急得走頭無路。他一落車，大使就把他扶進了一間小客室裏，急急把咖啡灌他。他醒了，但仍然不肯見那寡婦，大使可不管他，走出去便帶寡婦入來介紹。過了一會，太使回來了。手裏扶着一位貴婦。唐爾納看見，倒驚得目定口呆了。原來那位貴婦就是寡婦，那位寡婦就是他如醉如狂所想念的菲菲。大使給他們介紹了。唐爾納臉上現出得意的笑容，俯下去吻着蘇麗亞的織乎。她徐徐的說這：「要把面紗揭去嗎？」「不好了，我不跳牆了。」他滑稽地答着。站在旁邊的大使聽他們說話，倒覺莫明其妙。唐爾納接着說道：「從昨日起，我發狂地戀愛一個女人，但她離開我了，她叫菲菲，現在祇有你能够帮忙我尋着她了。」蘇麗亞苦着臉說：「你審死好了。她昨晚離開了你，就在旅館裏自殺了。」大使聽了這一段話，簡直氣得暈了，立即跑了出去。他們也走到花園裏，唐爾納輕輕的道：「我愛你簡直使我發狂了。」她冷冷的答道：「什麽人都說愛我，愛我什麽呢？我的美貌嗎？活潑嗎？抑或我的金錢嗎？」他也冷冷的的答道：「人家怎樣我可不知，但我是完全爲了你的金錢。」她聽了也不覺得奇怪。一轉身就用她的扇子望着他的臉打過去。他們面對面的望着一響不響，裏面的音樂響了。（未完）</p>

<p>To Discuss Preventing the Export of Silver</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin Customs has been strictly inspecting the export of silver for days.

The Tianjin Bankers' Association is scheduled to convene a meeting at 2 p.m. on the 29th to discuss the issue of preventing the export of silver and to make a specific statement on the proposal of the Shanghai financial community to encourage the import of silver. According to bankers, the silver crisis here is not as serious as the rumors in Shanghai. The tight money situation in the city is due to the excessive investment of various banks in rural areas in recent years, the increase in local product production, and the gradual depletion of cash outflows, which has nothing to do with the silver problem. This meeting will also discuss it together. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e27">After the Abandonment of the Washington Treaty · 有 <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from Dentsu: Regarding Japan's notification of the abandonment of the Washington Treaty, Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed the Japanese ambassador to the United States on the 26th to notify the Washington authorities. At the same time, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement to China and foreign countries stating that the London Naval Disarmament Conference is scheduled to continue at an appropriate time next spring. Secondly, the abandonment of the treaty is based on the inherent rights of the treaty. Based on this, Japan's determination to abandon the Washington Treaty has become a reality. It is truly regrettable that the weeks of turmoil at the London Naval Disarmament Preparatory Conference ultimately failed to harness the power of the world's peaceful appeals to avert the dangers of an arms race, even by a slim chance.</p>
<p>Today, all people in the world are well aware of the importance of human peace. Consider yesterday's speech by German Goebbels, who stated that Germany not only speaks of peace but is sincerely for peace. The British Emperor's broadcast stated that all countries must deal with national difficulties in the spirit of a large family. US President Roosevelt said that peace is his only aspiration. Even Japan, in its notification of the abandonment of the treaty, did not reject the arms race and hopes for the resumption of disarmament talks next year. However, when we look at the general trend today, it seems to contradict the facts. Consider the fervor with which countries are expanding their armaments. Without having to cite numerous examples, a review of the newspapers over the past few months already makes it clear. In addition to the great powers universally expanding their military budgets, some are focusing on air forces, others are rushing to build warships, and others are secretly completing the construction of colonial fortresses. None of these aims are unrelated to the competition for overseas markets, and all are concentrating their attention on the possibility of an incident in the Pacific. How then can we expect the disarmament efforts to bear fruit again, and how can we expect the realization of world peace?</p>
<p>The policy of competitive arms expansion, which is sufficient to shake the peace of East Asia, is, in essence, inextricably linked to the policy of market competition. The current situation, in which the Washington Treaty is unable to be maintained, is nothing more than the result of a zealous desire for foreign aggression. The distant incident of the September 18th Incident goes without saying. More recently, over the past year, Japan's various preparations in the Far East, its competition with Britain for markets in India, its rivalry with the United States in the Philippines, and its competition with the Netherlands for dumping goods in the East Indies, are all fundamental reasons why the overall peace in the Pacific cannot be maintained for a single day. In particular, the inability to maintain the overall peace in the Pacific after the abandonment of the treaty is even more evident.</p>
<p>However, our country is a nation that is inherently closely related to the overall peace of the Far East. The fundamental objective of maintaining the Washington Treaty was to maintain the balance of power among the powers in the Pacific. Since the last European war, the wounds of various countries have not yet healed, allowing them to maintain a temporary state of tranquility. Now, however, times have changed and circumstances have shifted. Although the aftershocks of the economic panic still reverberate in today's world, national strength has somewhat recovered, and various constructions are gradually returning to their former state. Thus, there is a desire to develop outward and to defend against foreign invasion. As a result, they are diverting their slightly recovered national strength to the strengthening of military preparations, and the trend of arms expansion has taken shape. The ambition to dominate the Pacific is becoming increasingly urgent, and the balance of power among the powers is being broken. In this situation, what strategies will our country employ to cope?</p>

<p>Terrorist Groups Secretly Linked to Him</p>
<p>Conspiracy Methods Coincide with Those of White Guardists</p>
<p>Stalin Determined to Thoroughly Eliminate Opposition</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, during the trial of Nikolaev, the assassin of Kirov, and thirteen other Communist Party members involved in the case, it was discovered that a certain foreign consul had been in close contact with key figures responsible for the case. However, the consul's nationality has not been revealed. According to the indictment, a Zinoviev faction opposed to Stalin had recently organized a counter-revolutionary terrorist group in Leningrad with the aim of carrying out terrorist acts against Soviet Russian leaders in order to change Soviet Russian policy to the proposals of Zinoviev and Trotsky. The group received armed assistance from a certain foreign country. Nikolaev had consulted with a certain consul to assist the group. The consul gave him 5,000 rubles and said that if Nikolaev gave him a letter addressed to Trotsky, he could connect the group with Trotsky. It was found that the aims and means of the group coincided with those of the Russian White Guardists overseas. The previous assassinations of famous Soviet Russian officials were all the result of White Guardist conspiracies. The indictment concluded by stating that Nikolaev had confessed to the crime. (Reuters Electric Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian prosecutor reported details of the conspiracy case to the military court. The conspiracy was to overthrow the current Soviet regime and replace it with a government of the Trotsky faction. Trotsky was one of the masterminds behind the scenes. The initial assassination attempt on Kirov in Leningrad three weeks ago was instigated by them. Other ruling leaders, Stalin, Molotov, and Kaganovich, were also their targets for assassination. The government officially announced today that thirteen of the fourteen suspects arrested in the Kirov case have confessed to belonging to a terrorist group in Leningrad. However, only Nikolaiyev and Edwardsdorf admitted to planning the assassination of Kirov. The fourteen have now been handed over to the military court on charges of treason and counter-revolution. It is reported that four of the eight people arrested in Leningrad were directly related to the Kirov murder case. When the prosecutor presented evidence, it involved the consulate of a certain country, causing quite a stir. The suspect Nikolaiyev also testified that the terrorist group's plan to assassinate Kirov was decided at the consulate of a certain country in Leningrad. The country had previously discussed the possibility of armed intervention in Soviet Russia. This time, the country's consul gave the terrorist party 5,000 rubles for activities in Leningrad and used the consulate as the headquarters of the counter-revolutionary presidium and was willing to secretly communicate with Trotsky, who is now in Turkey. Nikolaiyev also said that the terrorists aimed to overthrow Stalin, Molotov, and Kaganovich and now take Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev. It is claimed that the counter-revolutionary plan was agreed upon by the terrorist leaders on November 1st and planned to start from Leningrad and extend to Moscow. The plan was found in Nikolaiyev's pocket when he was arrested. The plan also included propaganda methods on how to publicize the shortcomings of Stalin and others' rule to the Russian people. However, since mere propaganda made no progress, they carried out their terrorist activities. (Guomin Electric Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In response to the request of the Soviet Russian authorities, the French government has notified Trotsky, who is residing in central France, and instructed him not to engage in any more political activities. If he does not comply, the French government will immediately deport him. According to the French secret police, no one knows the location of Trotsky's residence. It is now under strict surveillance. However, after a search by the police authorities, no evidence of any political activities by Trotsky was found. (Guomin Electric Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The public indictment of Nikolaiyev and thirteen others in the case of the assassination of Kirov, Secretary of the United Communist Party Central Committee and the Leningrad Committee, has been published here. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the results of the interrogation, it is known that although the former Zinoviev anti-Soviet faction has surrendered, its activists continue their secret work until recently. Their activities were most intense between last year and this year, when former Zinoviev faction members organized a counter-revolutionary secret terrorist group in Leningrad, led by the so-called "Leningrad Center." Their activities were very secret. Their main purpose was to carry out terrorist acts against the main leaders of the Soviet Union government to disintegrate its leadership and thereby change the current government's policy to the so-called Zinoviev-Trotskyism. Since they could not obtain the support of the masses and were only an independent anti-Soviet group with no political future, they believed that their goals had no hope of realization, so they resorted to direct terrorist actions. The results of the interrogation prove that the group did not hope to use the assassination of Kirov as a signal to cause a rebellion against the United Communist Party and the Soviet Union government within the country. What they expected was mainly foreign aid, armed intervention, and the support of certain foreign countries. The point that relying on foreign intervention is the only means to overthrow the Soviet Union government is fully expressed in the opinions of the criminal Nikolaiyev. Nikolaiyev did not hide this opinion from those close to him.</p>
<p>The interrogation also proved that Nikolaiyev had repeatedly visited a certain country's consul in Leningrad in accordance with his preliminary decision with Kotolinov, a member of the "Leningrad Center" (the name of a certain country and the name of the consul were replaced by dotted lines when the full text was published) to discuss ways to assist the group. Nikolaiyev always provided the consul with information on the issues of concern to the consul. Nikolaiyev claimed, "In my confession on December 20th, I already said that we always wanted to assist the consul with accurate information on the Soviet Union. At this time, what I said refers to the conversations between me, Shazki, and Kotolinov. We believe that we must arouse the consul's interest in materials related to Soviet Union's internal affairs that are anti-Soviet Union in nature. I also asked the consul to give us material assistance and told him that we could repay this amount once our economic situation changed. After our third or fourth consultation at the consulate, the consul agreed to my request and granted 5,000 rubles. The consul also said that if our group had a letter to be forwarded to Trotsky, he could establish contact with Trotsky. I reported the results of my conversation with the consul to Mr. Kotolinov and handed over 4,500 rubles to Mr. Kotolinov. I kept 500 rubles for my own use."</p>
<p>The interrogation also proved that the purpose and methods of the counter-revolutionary terrorist group "Leningrad Center" and the open enemies of the Soviet Union people (the weak White Guardist organizations of landlords and capitalists, such as the "Russian Military Alliance" and the "Russian Truth Brotherhood") completely coincided. (Note: The Russian Truth Brotherhood was a follower of Denikin. The aforementioned enemies openly conducted their terrorist propaganda and often sent personnel to infiltrate the Soviet Union to launch and carry out the assassination of representatives of the Soviet Union government. They rolled in Switzerland to assassinate Volovszky and in Vasa to assassinate Vobaiev. It has now been proven that there were two terrorist groups active at the same time during this period. One was led by Kotolinov, a member of the Leningrad Center, and his subordinates included Nikolaiyev, Svistedov, Antonov, Sokolov, and Yustkin. The other was led by Shazki. Nikolaiyev also set laws to make this act illegal, so he fabricated the seals of various state organs and forged various documents (such as diaries) and applications to various organs, etc., turning the assassination of Kirov into a personal act of disappointment and dissatisfaction and viewing it as a protest against Kirov's unfair treatment, thereby concealing the traces of his crime and his accomplices and the true motives for his assassination of Kirov. Nikolaiyev himself also admitted that these documents were fabricated and said that his forgery of these documents was in accordance with his preliminary decision with the members of the terrorist group. This group decided to disguise the assassination of Kirov as a personal act to conceal its true intentions. Nikolaiyev openly admitted in his confession, "I must make the assassination of Kirov a personal act to cover up the fact that Zinoviev participated in this matter." Nikolaiyev resolutely rejected all suggestions to help him with his affairs, either claiming that he was in poor health and needed to study them, or claiming that the environment did not allow him to take on the work. All these facts and the entire interrogation process can prove the accuracy of the above points. According to the testimony of witnesses (including Nikolaiyev's mother and wife), Nikolaiyev and his family did not have any material shortages at the time.</p>
<p>The interrogation also proved that this criminal-minded counter-revolutionary terrorist group "Leningrad Center" did indeed hold a revengeful view, because Kirov was the person who ideologically and politically defeated the former Zinoviev faction in Leningrad. They had planned to assassinate Kirov, and this act was carried out by Nikolaiyev on December 1st. Nikolaiyev fully admitted to the crime. Kotolinov admitted to participating in the counter-revolutionary secret group and being one of its leaders. Although he denied directly participating in the assassination of Kirov, he should be responsible for this act as he was the leader of the group. The defendant Shazki firmly denied the charges, but his crimes have been confessed by Nikolaiyev and Kotolinov. The defendant Sokolov admitted to participating in the secret terrorist group but denied directly presiding over the assassination. The defendants Svistedov and Antonov fully confessed. The defendant Luminan Tuiyev only admitted to participating in the secret group of the former Zinoviev faction. The defendant Mandelstan admitted to participating in the work of the group and being a member of the "Leningrad Center" but denied being involved in the assassination. The defendant Tolmachov admitted to being a member of the group. The defendant Levin admitted to being one of the leaders of the former Zinoviev faction's secret organization in Leningrad. The defendants Hannick and Musnikov only admitted to participating in the secret organization of the former Zinoviev faction. The defendant Susiitzki admitted to being a member of the Leningrad Center and knew that the former Zinoviev anti-Soviet secret group had terrorist tendencies. The above-mentioned defendants will all be prosecuted for participating in the counter-revolutionary secret terrorist group and for presiding over and preparing the assassination of Kirov (carried out by Nikolaiyev), that is, they will be prosecuted for the crimes under Sections 8 and 11 of Article 56 of the Criminal Code. They will all be tried by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. (Tas Electric Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's search for opposition party members is continuing with all its efforts. Newspapers report daily on new demonstrations and the discovery of new enemies of the working class. Trotskyist students in universities in various provinces are also continuing to advocate anti-government sentiments, and the Soviet Russian secret police will soon publish a list of those arrested in connection with the Leningrad assassination case. Because the Soviet Russian government has decided to thoroughly investigate the Nikolaiyev incident and arrest all anti-government elements in one fell swoop, even former government officials and important party officials are sometimes subjected to extreme punishment as a warning to dissatisfied elements, regardless of whether they have participated in revolutionary crimes. However, foreign observers in Moscow said that Nikolaiyev's assassination of Kirov was a personal vendetta because Kirov had dismissed Nikolaiyev from his position, causing Nikolaiyev to be unemployed for a long time.

<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito officially announced today that Japan will notify the United States government on Saturday that it is abandoning the naval treaty. For three weeks, Japan and the United States have been observing each other to avoid bearing the responsibility for disrupting the London Naval Talks. Now, this will come to an end due to Japan's one-sided notification. Japan will also notify the other signatory countries. This notification has also been delayed as much as possible because Japan still wants to avoid the responsibility of disrupting the talks. US Chief Representative Davis will be on his way back home. Japan clearly believes that the United States was the first to advocate disrupting the talks. In fact, the failure of the talks was far earlier than several weeks ago. The US government stated that the day the notification of the abandonment of the treaty is presented is the time when the London talks end. Therefore, Japan should be responsible for the failure of the talks. Davis originally hoped to return home before Christmas but has now delayed his departure to avoid the responsibility of leaving the meeting first. In fact, the United States has long known that Japan will abandon the Washington and London Treaties. Its participation in the London talks to seek a peaceful solution was also out of necessity.

<p>(Paris) The Naval Research Institute discussed the impact of the Washington Naval Treaty on the French Navy today. Several members, mostly naval officers, participated. After the discussion, the Institute passed a petition and unanimously decided to submit it to the Ministry of the Navy. The petition requested the government to adopt appropriate measures within the conditions stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty to prevent the major clauses of the treaty from being extended, and to continue the current negotiations so that the French naval position can be in line with French maritime and colonial interests. The Naval Research Institute believes that the naval restriction methods stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty are not in line with French needs. The restricted quantity is arbitrarily stipulated. France recognized it at the time because it was temporary and only restricted a part of the warships. France also wanted to express its willingness to support disarmament, so it did not refuse. The Naval Research Institute also reviewed the situation when the Washington Naval Treaty was passed in the National Assembly, stating that when the treaty was submitted to the National Assembly for approval, the government stated that France would regain its freedom once the period stipulated in the treaty expired. The National Assembly approved it after obtaining this guarantee from the government. The Naval Research Institute also believes that since the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty, the international situation has changed greatly, which is completely different from what people hoped for at the Washington Conference in 1922. Therefore, the Washington Naval Treaty cannot be extended. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The National Forum newspaper will publish an article written by former Foreign Minister Peng Gu tomorrow, entitled "The United States and Freedom of the Seas," which briefly states: "On the 19th of this month, President Roosevelt met with reporters at the White House, when Secretary of State Hull announced that the government is currently studying how to determine the attitude of the United States towards the issue of maritime neutrality in wartime. Subsequently, the New York Times explained that the maritime neutrality attitude announced by Secretary of State Hull meant that the US government would no longer protect merchant ships flying the American flag that risk sailing into the "conflict zone." As for other claims that the United States will abandon its old isolationism and participate in international sanctions, it is too early to say. This declaration by Hull can be called a fundamental policy, or it can be called a clever strategy. The so-called strategy is to make the American people feel that the President's intention is to consolidate neutrality or take cautious measures to avoid the United States from being involved in the war again, so that it is easier to accept the new policy mentioned above. In short, Roosevelt is a politician with great talent and ambition. Since taking office, he has had bold new initiatives every month, which we have long admired. Although he uses circuitous means to change his maritime neutrality policy, the result is that, at least, the United States will no longer hinder other countries from taking beneficial actions. If so, then this change in policy can be regarded as an important supplement to the Kellogg-Briand Pact." (Note that the United States has advocated maintaining maritime neutrality and is unwilling to participate in all international sanctions. Although the United States initiated the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, there are no provisions for sanctions against countries that violate the treaty and start wars. Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates a sanction method. Each member state should sever commercial and financial relations with countries that engage in war in violation of the treaty, and prohibit all communication between the people and the people of the violating country. However, because the United States insists on the principle of freedom of the seas, it has not joined the League of Nations, so this sanction method is often hindered by it and cannot be implemented. Now that the United States has changed its neutral principle and does not protect American merchant ships that sail into belligerent countries, then even if the United States does not participate in international sanctions, it will not hinder other countries from implementing sanctions. The meaning of the last paragraph of this article should be in this.) (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas decided today to hold a congressional monetary conference here on January 16 next year. The purpose is to unite the various factions that attempt to raise prices and inflate currency. The method is to start with controlled inflation. Thomas has now invited senators and representatives in this Congress who support the separate silver bill. This conference has attracted much attention from the outside world, because it can not only specifically show the strength of the silver faction, but also infer from it whether it is possible to reconcile the opinions of various factions on the issue of currency and inflation. According to opinions from some sources yesterday, if the silver faction has a large momentum, President Roosevelt intends to simultaneously reduce the gold and silver content of the US dollar. This move can eliminate the need to increase silver purchases in foreign markets, but can increase the domestic price of silver and satisfy the desires of the silver faction.

<p>(London) It is reported that the small committee dispatched by the London Metal Exchange two weeks ago to study the issue of opening spot and forward silver trading has made great progress. It is reported that it has selected important institutions recognized internationally as places to store large bars. Silver will be stored in the vaults of these institutions, and a type of security will be issued as the basis for trading. This procedure is the same as the trading of other metals. The London Metal Exchange will conduct silver trading in the morning and afternoon, approximately three times a day, depending on the amount of business. Operators of large bars do not seem to worry about competition, because it is expected that the silver trading of the Metal Exchange will only be limited to a few speculators. The new market can benefit the silver market because the price of silver will be known in the morning thereafter. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>British Coal Sales to Italy Have Decreased Significantly</p>
<p>(London) Business in British stores is very good, so the business situation in the New Year seems very promising. In recent years, electricity consumption has increased significantly compared to the past.

<p>Difficulties in Drafting New Budget, Various Agencies to Reduce Administration</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Finance Department convened a financial meeting on the 24th to discuss the drafting of the 24th year budget. Those attending were Zhāng Hòuwǎn, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Hú Yuánhuì, Director of the Department of Construction, Wèi Jiàn, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Zhèng Dàorú, Director of the Department of Education, who was absent due to other matters and sent Section Chief Shū Zǐqí as his representative. Lǔ Mùtíng, Director of the Department of Finance, was unable to attend due to a foot ailment and sent Sūn Xiàngqián, the secretary-director of the department, as his representative. The meeting was chaired by Wèi Jiàn. After the meeting, Wèi Jiàn explained the general situation of the province's financial revenues and expenditures. It was stated that the total deficit in the province's final accounts for the 22nd year was over 5 million yuan. Although revenues this year have shown a slight improvement, due to the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees, it is estimated that there will still be a deficit of over 1.4 million yuan. The province's sources of revenue have been exhausted. Furthermore, at the National Financial Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance this year, it was decided that all provinces should completely abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees by the end of the 23rd year. A large portion of the province's revenue is from regular taxes, but 40-50% still involves excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees. If the ministry's order is followed, it will not only affect tax revenue but also potentially create problems for the progress of general administration. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to make up for the losses on the one hand and to carefully review and reduce expenditures on the other, so as to balance revenues and expenditures and prevent the budget for the 24th year from running into difficulties. When the province convened the provincial administrative conference, the Ministry of Finance sent expert Wēng Zhīyóng to the province, who proposed a plan for reorganizing the province's finances and drafting a new budget. The plan was based on the actual expenditures of the province's Party and government agencies in the 22nd year as a standard, regardless of previous surpluses or deficits, to be used as the basis for drafting the budget for the 24th year. In a desperate situation, the province can only implement this plan to maintain operations. However, with this budget, the expenditures of various agencies in the province will be reduced by a certain amount. Agencies have no other choice but to implement austerity policies. How to reduce personnel and administrative expenses is also a very important issue. Therefore, the meeting was convened to decide on the standards for drafting the provincial budget and to discuss how to change the budgets of various agencies, etc. After the report, the attendees discussed the matter in detail for several hours. Each department stated that the budget they had prepared had already been reduced to the minimum. If further reductions were made, it would be necessary to conduct a detailed review of what should be reduced and what should be cut, re-compile the budget, and then submit it for discussion. A decision was made to adjourn the meeting at that time. It is reported that the province's tax revenues this year in the counties south of Hebei Province have either suffered from famine, drought, and floods, or have not recovered from last year's locust plague, resulting in unsatisfactory revenues and many delays in paying land taxes. In the counties of the war zone north of Hebei Province, due to being within a special sphere of influence, rural areas have gone bankrupt, resulting in a certain reduction in revenues. Compared to these areas, only the central counties are doing relatively well, with an average of 70-80% of taxes paid. As for the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees in the province, apart from the first phase that has already been implemented, the second phase will have to be postponed to next year for gradual implementation due to the lack of funds to compensate for the losses.

<p>Inspecting Rural Cleanup Matters in Southern Anhui</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The inspection team from the Nanchang Headquarters for inspecting the rural cleanup and rehabilitation affairs in the bandit suppression areas, led by Director Lǐ Wànlǐ, has arrived in Wuhu yesterday with member Chén Kèchéng to inspect the rural cleanup matters in various counties in southern Anhui. A joint meeting was convened at the Commissioner's Office, attended by Commissioner Wáng Zhùrén, Public Security Bureau Chief Wáng Zōngfén, Deputy Commander of the Security Forces Hú Pèigēng, as well as the heads of the Public Works Bureau, the Construction Commissioner, and various district heads. Director Lǐ immediately instructed on the implementation according to the regulations of the Headquarters inspection team. Regarding the security forces, they must be built into a strong and effective force. The militia must enhance their self-defense capabilities. The defenses must prevent bandits from infiltrating. Food distribution must ensure that no one in the jurisdiction is displaced. The pao-chia [neighborhood watch] system must be strictly organized so that bad people cannot hide. Cooperatives must complete the cooperative organization of all districts in the county. Popular education must ensure that all illiterate adults receive popular education. Traffic must complete the main roads in the county, connect the counties and neighboring telephones, repair and guard bridges, eliminate all illegal and excessive taxes, and improve the financial organization. After the meeting, the following resolutions were made: (1) Coordination between the pao-chia system and education: the urban areas' joint pao-chia system will be divided into several educational districts, and each district must set up a school, with the principal responsible for urging school-age children in the district to enroll and for popular education. (2) In rural areas, each joint pao will set up a school, with the principal serving concurrently as the director, and jointly responsible for popular education. (3) Graduates from the militia cadres training program will be used to fill the positions of militia captains in the joint pao, and will also be responsible for assisting the pao-chia chiefs in compiling and checking household registrations. Their allowances will be paid from the pao-chia funds. (4) Each school principal in the education district and the pao-chia district must jointly conduct a drill once a year. (5) The district public office will select one person with military experience to serve as a district officer and be responsible for commanding the militia training. (6) Standard of defense deployment: Wuhu and Dangtu will rush to build city defense bunkers, and the lines of fire must be connected. The city walls of Chaoxian, Wuwei, Tongling, Fan, Nanling, and Liuan counties must be intact, and bunkers must be built as appropriate. The militia in the urban area of Wuhu must be under unified command and training, and designated guarding sections. (7) Promoting cooperatives: A joint office of cooperative instructors from various counties will be established in the Commissioner's Office, and the Provincial Cooperative Committee, the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, the Shanghai Bank, and the Industrial Bank of China will jointly organize cooperatives in various counties and provide loans. It is planned to set up more than one hundred cooperatives in each county. (8) Public Security Issues in Wuhu City: Capable household registration police officers will be selected, and household registration will be checked and personnel registration will be handled based on the pao-chia system. The Wuhu City Public Security Bureau Chief will be responsible for the public safety of Wuhu City. (9) Rectification of the Security Forces: Based on the guiding principles for improving the security system, the spirit of education and training of the committee, the commissioner will supervise and order various counties to complete the work within one month and await inspection. After the inspection team completes its work in Wuhu, it will go to Huizhou and various counties in southern Anhui to conduct on-site inspections. The Anhui Provincial Government has specially assigned personnel to assist at any time. (December 25th)</p>

<p>Chén Péikūn Inspects Disaster Situation in Liancheng, Xiamen Copper Coins Surge in Price, Have Slightly Fallen Back</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Relief Committee, organized by the provincial government and chaired by Chén Péikūn, recently traveled to western Fujian with Kāng Shàozhōu, consultant to the Security Office, carrying 40,000 yuan in cash, to inspect the disaster situation in the bandit areas and provide relief. Chén and others departed from Zhangzhou on the 14th and returned to Zhangzhou on the 22nd after completing the inspection. They issued a statement on the results of the inspection, stating that they took a car to Longyan on the 14th, stayed for four days, went to Pengkou on the 18th, and then to Hetian, 40 li from Changting. Because the road from Hetian to Changting was not finished, the road was very rugged, so Kāng Shàozhōu went to Changting to inspect and distribute relief. Chén returned to Pengkou and went to Liancheng to inspect for two days, and returned to Yan on the 21st and arrived in Zhangzhou on the 22nd. Liancheng had been occupied by bandits for a long time, and many houses and villages were destroyed, leaving only broken tiles and ruined walls. The county government building was leveled and is now used as a training ground for troops. Nine out of ten residents have left, with only a few men who have recently returned after the recovery. Outside the city and in the countryside, there are more women. Strong men have either died or fled. There is a severe shortage of rice, oil, and salt. Local people and the garrison have jointly formed a cooperative, which has an oil and salt sales office, so there is no worry about supply. In terms of finance, the county chamber of commerce currently issues paper money, which can be exchanged for Bank of China notes. As a result of the inspection, it was concluded that in addition to Wenfang and Pengkou, which have been heavily affected by the war and are in dire need of emergency relief, the rest should focus on work relief. Upon returning to the province, a report on the inspection will be prepared, and a plan will be submitted to the province for implementation. When we arrived in Yan, rice prices in Wenfang and Pengkou were very high, so we first sold 2,000 yuan of rice at a subsidized price. As for rural finance, there is a branch of the Four Provinces Farmers Bank in Xiamen, and it has been decided to establish a branch in Liancheng. Also, Chén telegraphed the provincial government in Yan, stating that after Changting was recovered, the population was increasing daily, and there was a shortage of rice and salt. He had purchased 1,000 bags of rice from Zhangzhou and requested the Pacification Headquarters to allocate ten trucks to transport them to Longyan and then to Changting to provide relief. As for salt, 100,000 catties of salt have been allocated from the Shima Salt Affairs Bureau, to be transported by merchants to Changting, Liancheng, and Ninghua for sale at a subsidized price. Also, in the newly recovered bandit areas of Liancheng, Changting, Ruijin, and Huichang, the Red Bandits searched for and took away all the cash when they fled westward. After the recovery, as people gradually gathered and merchants became more prosperous, there was an unusual shortage of cash. However, the bandit areas were extremely poor, and transactions rarely involved silver dollars. As a result, merchants from Zhangzhou and Xiamen competed to transport copper coins to the recovered bandit areas to make a profit. In the past two weeks, a large amount of copper coins flowed into Liancheng, Changting, Ruijin, and Huichang, and the price of copper coins in Zhangzhou and Xiamen surged. One Xiamen silver dollar could originally be exchanged for more than 370 copper coins, and one small silver coin (ten cents) could be exchanged for 30 copper coins. In the middle of this month, the price surged wildly. On the 18th, it surged to only 235 copper coins for one silver dollar, a loss of more than 130 copper coins, and 20 copper coins for one small silver coin, a loss of 10 copper coins, an increase of one-third or more. The reason for this is that merchants are hoarding and speculating. By the 24th, it had begun to fall to 24 copper coins for one small silver coin and 270 copper coins for one silver dollar.

<h3 id="e107">The Ministry of Finance's Review of National Finance: Past and Future (Continued) <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shandong Province: Located in the heart of the Jinpu Railway, Shandong is rich in resources and its people are prosperous. The revenue and expenditure for the 20th year of the Republic were 10,063,000, 12,460,000 in the 21st year, and 12,700,000 in the 22nd year. There have been no significant changes overall, and the finance can be considered stable. Starting this year, the first batch of provincial taxes that hinder central revenue, such as the tobacco tax and other taxes that involve double taxation, such as the meat trade and opera tax, and those that hinder transportation, such as excessive loading, vehicle, pedestrian, and boat taxes, totaling 109,728 yuan, as well as miscellaneous local taxes in various counties amounting to 31,174 yuan, will all be abolished in July. The second batch includes a total of 602 types of provincial and county miscellaneous taxes, totaling 197,556 yuan, which will be abolished from December 1st.</p>
<p>▲ Hebei Province: Due to years of war and disasters, Hebei has suffered a continuous stream of misfortunes. As a result, the rural areas have declined, commerce has stagnated, and financial difficulties are more severe than in the past. This year, the first financial conference was convened, and representatives from the Hebei Provincial Department of Finance attended. After detailed discussions, the estimated shortfall in revenue and expenditure is approximately 1,710,000 yuan. However, the provincial authorities are still able to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes amidst extremely difficult financial circumstances. The implementation is rapid. (1) Labor service, with an annual amount of 191,003 yuan, miscellaneous taxes with an annual amount of 60,010 yuan, and miscellaneous income with an annual amount of 31,045 yuan. Of the above three items, the amount belonging to the provincial treasury is slightly more than 165,580 yuan, and the remainder is allocated to various counties. There are 90 types of miscellaneous taxes belonging to the county, such as livestock transit tax, with an annual amount of 273,302 yuan, all of which will be abolished uniformly from July 1st. Furthermore, in 51 counties where the surcharge on land tax exceeds the regular tax, it has been reduced to within the regular tax. In 32 counties, including Cangxian, the surcharge is equal to the regular tax, resulting in a total reduction of 799,000 yuan. The remaining 19 counties, including Wen'an, still need to reduce 596,000 yuan, and strict orders have been given to reduce it within the deadline.</p>
<p>▲ Shanxi Province: Due to the supply of troops stationed in the province and the occurrence of droughts and floods in recent years, Shanxi Province is at risk of having revenue not meeting expenditure. The local finances of various counties are also extremely chaotic. After the resolutions of the financial conference were announced, in accordance with the central government's intention to care for the people, the names of harsh levies and forced apportionments, such as those based on grain, mu, or household, and those differentiated by military service, education, and construction, have been strictly reduced or abolished. In addition, among the various taxes, the decision was made to first abolish the four items that levy taxes on goods and involve harsh details, such as egg white, egg yolk, walnut, peach kernel, pig and sheep small intestine, and cattle and sheep bone horn.</p>
<p>▲ Shaanxi Province: Since the founding of the Republic, Shaanxi Province has been plagued by warfare, and there have been no peaceful years. In addition, natural disasters have been frequent, and the vitality of the province has been depleted. The provincial treasury has debts of more than 10 million. Currently, the Department of Finance is implementing a strict austerity policy, eliminating embezzlement, and formulating a reorganization plan. As for the case of abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes resolved by the financial conference, Shaanxi Province is also determined to implement it in accordance with the central government's intention. The amount of abolished taxes has reached more than 100,000 yuan. It is also planned to reduce or exempt 61 types of local taxes, totaling more than 280,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Suiyuan Province: Suiyuan Province is located in a remote and barren area, and the people are struggling. Starting this year, it is planned to waive all outstanding taxes from the 17th and 18th years of the Republic, amounting to more than 390,000 yuan. In addition, redundant institutions will be merged, which can save 340,000 yuan per year. The budget for the security regiment will be reduced by more than 100,000 yuan in the first year, striving to gradually achieve a non-salary system. In addition, by eliminating extravagance and harsh disturbances, the burden on the people of Suiyuan can be reduced by at least 700,000 yuan per year. Regarding the taxes in Suiyuan Province that should be abolished, the following are included: Koubei Mongolian Salt Food Household Tax, Tax, Coal Tax, Freight Tax, Oil Tax, Wugongba Road Work Tax, Pig Bristle Tax, Public Debt Additional Charcoal Half Tax, Boat Escort Fee, Boat Escort Additional Office Fee, Vegetable and Grass Boat License Fee, Nursery Fee, and other 13 types, with an annual reduction of more than 210,000 yuan, which are limited to be abolished from August 1st to December 1st. Regarding the taxes and fees in other counties that should be abolished, those that have already been abolished include miscellaneous taxes and land tax surcharges in Guisui, Xinghe, Helin, Qingshui, Hexian, Guyang, Jining, and Liangcheng, totaling 45,586 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Chahar Province: Chahar Province is originally a barren area. Since the Zhangjiakou-Kulun road was blocked, commerce stagnated, and the rural economy was in distress. In addition, due to frequent misfortunes in recent years, the finances of various counties are increasingly unable to make ends meet. Under these circumstances, the provincial authorities are still able to separately abolish 25 types of miscellaneous taxes, totaling 20,879 yuan, and cancel the number of apportioned funds in various counties, totaling 511,779 yuan. It is also planned to implement the reduction and exemption of labor service in various counties from January 1st of the 24th year of the Republic, totaling 11,876 yuan, a land tax surcharge of 91,187 yuan, and provincial local donations of 219,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Ningxia Province: Ningxia is located in a remote border area, and commerce is sluggish. Border defense is important, and military affairs are increasingly urgent, with huge military expenditures. Although the various military and administrative expenses have been reduced to the extreme, there is still an annual deficit of more than 1.5 million yuan. However, the provincial government is still able to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes in three phases in accordance with the time limit set by the ministry. The first phase includes nine types: rice purchase tax, livestock tax, salt camel tax, cart camel tax, land mu smoke lamp tax, and head burden tax, totaling 124,776 yuan annually, which will be abolished from August 1st. The second phase includes two types: post-disaster fines and special cigarette tax, totaling 301,140 yuan annually, which will be abolished from November 1st. The third phase includes one type: temporary maintenance fee, totaling 344,660 yuan, which will be abolished on January 1st of the 24th year of the Republic. ▲ Gansu Province: Due to the excessive burden of military expenses, Gansu Province's finances are exhausted. As a result, levies are collected locally, with numerous items. Recently, the province has been trying to reorganize in order to comply with the resolutions of the financial conference. Among the taxes, the most urgent and important of those that are similar to excessive and detailed taxes are: the abolition of the mill tax, which is approximately 40,000 yuan per year, the camel tax, which is approximately 120,000 yuan per year, and the tea tax, which is approximately 130,000 yuan per year. As for land tax, the most unfair burden is the field grain, and the amount of tax is often several times higher than the people's grain. It is now being limited to change the field to the people, and after implementation, it can be reduced by approximately 290,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>▲ Qinghai Province: Since the abolition of the likin in the 20th year of the Republic, Qinghai Province's revenue has decreased significantly. In addition, due to the war in the Northeast, most of the fur has not been shipped, and the tax revenue has been insufficient. The accumulated deficit over the years has reached 4,290,000 yuan. Since the financial conference, Qinghai Province, in accordance with the central government's intention to reorganize land tax, plans to abolish the surcharge amount of more than 14,600 yuan. As for the excessive and miscellaneous taxes of various provincial assets, efforts are also being made to abolish them.</p>
<p>▲ Guizhou Province: Guizhou Province is located in the center of the southwest and has always been known as barren. Since the order was given to abolish the likin in the 20th year of the Republic, the province has suddenly lost a huge amount of revenue. In addition, disasters have been frequent, and the annual revenue and expenditure are extremely different. Although various counties have never had a land tax surcharge, the collection of donations and taxes is complicated. Since the order was given to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes, it has been thoroughly reorganized, and it has been decided to abolish them in three phases, with two months as a period, from July 1st to the end of December of the 23rd year of the Republic. The first phase has already abolished more than 16,000 yuan of excessive and miscellaneous taxes, and efforts are still being made to abolish all excessive and miscellaneous taxes in the province by the end of the year.</p>
<p>▲ Fujian Province: Incidents occur frequently in Fujian Province, and tax revenue deviates from the norm. Various counties often solicit requests from local groups and arbitrarily add surcharges to the provincial tax. Recently, the Department of Finance has actively reorganized, and the first batch has abolished the most excessive and miscellaneous taxes, such as jasmine, chicken, duck, and goose taxes, totaling more than 10,000 yuan per year. The second batch will abolish 12 types of excessive river taxes in the Jiulongkou area of Zhangzhou and 98 types of miscellaneous local taxes in various counties, with an annual amount of more than 83,600 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong Province: Since the implementation of the three-year administration plan, Guangdong Province has made the most efforts to reduce and abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes. Those belonging to the provincial treasury revenue have been reduced by more than 80 types, with an annual amount of more than 115,000 yuan, all of which will be abolished separately in August of this year. In addition, there are 1,680,000 yuan of likin-like revenue, which are planned to be abolished uniformly by the end of July of next year. ▲ Guangxi Province: Guangxi Province's finances have been reorganized the most vigorously, such as (1) dividing provincial and county taxes, (2) unifying revenue and expenditure, (3) strictly implementing budgets and final accounts, (4) summarizing the names of taxes, (5) equalizing the tax burden, and (6) abolishing transit taxes. The effect of implementing this for a year has been quite remarkable. As for the various excessive and miscellaneous items that have been abolished, the number of those that can be verified is more than 430,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>▲ Sichuan Province: Sichuan Province's defense areas have not yet been unified, and there is no investigation into the finances. In addition, the latent spread of communist bandits is enough to affect the stability of the finances. Currently, the provincial authorities are trying their best to plan. If there is anything that can be done, they will proceed accordingly in order to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>▲ Yunnan Province: Yunnan Province has abolished excessive and miscellaneous taxes since the reform of the tax system in the 19th year of the Republic. Over the years, approximately 100 types have been reduced and abolished. There is no surcharge on land tax, but due to the complexity of the names, a land survey has been conducted. In the counties where the survey has been completed, a cultivated land tax is levied at a tax rate of approximately 2/1000 of the land price. Recently, in order to rectify the groups, the counties have no funds to handle it, so a group fund of one time the regular tax is levied in addition to the regular tax, for a total of 4/1000.</p>
<p>▲ Xinjiang Province: Xinjiang Province is located in a remote western border area. Due to the frequent wars in recent years, the finances are chaotic. When the National Financial Conference was held this year, the Xinjiang Provincial Government sent representatives to attend by telegram. Now that the internal chaos has been quelled, the issue of financial reform can be gradually reorganized.</p>
<p>▲ Beiping City: Most of the various taxes in Beiping City follow the old system of the Capital Engineering and Patrol Donation Bureau. Now, in accordance with the financial plan, it has been decided to abolish all 13 types, including tooth tax and livestock tax, totaling more than 240,000 yuan, from November 1st. It is limited to be reorganized clearly within the year.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai City: Shanghai is the most prosperous commercial area in the country. Municipal construction is progressing with the times. The expenditure in the 22nd year included a debt fee of 2,101,620 yuan. As for the tax portion, from the 23rd year, the names such as busy Cao will be abolished, and they will all be renamed land tax, divided into two types: regular and supplementary. The supplementary tax of Baoshan County exceeds one percent of the regular tax, and it has been reduced separately. There are no excessive or miscellaneous taxes in the various donations and fees collected in the urban area. It has entered the right track.</p>
<p>▲ Nanjing City: Nanjing City is a model area, and all constructions are waiting to be carried out. The revenue is only more than 2.9 million, while the expenditure reaches more than 4.8 million, with a huge debt. After this financial conference, in addition to the rice grain 4/1000 tax, which was abolished in October of last year, the remaining 13 types of existing house tax, car tax, deed tax, and tooth tax have all been revised separately by the municipal government, or changed to business tax, or proposed to be abolished.</p>
<p>▲ Qingdao City: Qingdao has been actively managed since it was recovered by our country and has become a large port on the northern coast. The city's revenue reaches more than 4.88 million yuan, and the construction is becoming more and more perfect. After this year's financial conference, a plan for reorganizing land tax was formulated: (1) compiling a land tax register and abolishing the agency collection system, and (2) conducting a land survey in rural areas and levying taxes on all land without grain. As for excessive and miscellaneous taxes, they have already been abolished.</p>
<p>▲ Weihaiwei: After Weihaiwei was recovered by us, a management commissioner's office was established to actively reorganize. Regarding taxes, such as fishing boat license fee, cargo sampan license fee, wind boat license fee of more than 200 dan, fishing boat license fee, and meat shop license fee, all four types will be abolished from October 1st of this year. The above five types of revenue, totaling 3,640 yuan, will be offset by the entire revenue of the tobacco and alcohol license tax in the area, which is 3,680 yuan. (End)</p>

<p>Lu Wanqiu, a 19-year-old girl from Jiading, was studying at the Shanghai College on Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai. She was beautiful and had been betrothed to Wang Dazhi, a primary school teacher in Yangzhou. After the summer vacation this year, she owed 30 yuan in tuition fees to the school, and the current semester's food and other fees had not been paid either. She repeatedly urged her family to send money, and as a result, she only received 50 yuan, which was not enough to cover the expenses. A female classmate, Pan, promised to lend her money, so Lu took a train from Shanghai to Kunshan last month, planning to take a boat to Taicang to borrow money from Pan. Unexpectedly, she met a man named Pan Daochang at the pier. After learning the reason, Pan generously offered to lend money to Lu, advising her not to bother with the journey. So, they returned to Shanghai together. He gave her a bad check for 30 yuan, and then induced Lu to stay at the Public Security Hostel on Simalu for several days. Then, they returned to Kunshan together. Later, Lu realized that Pan already had a wife and could not help but feel resentful. She planned to commit suicide by lying on the tracks but was stopped by Pan. Later, Lu was introduced by Pan to Yu Huichun, a friend who runs the Wulin Hostel on Wumalu, Shanghai, to live with. Yu was 39 years old, from Suzhou, and not handsome. Recently, Yu and Lu returned to Suzhou together and rented a house along the river to live together. The girl's mother found out and took the two of them to the police station and sent them to the local court for interrogation and detention.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from the Hangzhou Seawall Project Office to the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the Shazimo No. 4 stone seawall in the Xuanwei section of the project is in danger because the sand on the beach outside the seawall has accumulated too high, causing the southern tide to impact it in a direction completely different from before. The strip stones on the first and second beaches were impacted by the tide, becoming chaotic and disorganized. The seawall body is drifting outward, and the soil behind the seawall is sinking a lot, creating a dangerous situation. Please find a way to dispatch workers to rescue it. In addition to reporting to the department, the bureau immediately dispatched workers to build the first and second beaches to protect the seawall body. At the same time, it plans to build a submerged dam to defend against the southern tide, and a surveying team was organized to measure the changes in the riverbed and beach in order to fundamentally reorganize it.</p>

<p>China Merchants Bureau to Handle Lian-Yue Joint Transport</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the western section of the Longhai Railway has now been completed. Eight passenger and freight trains were first opened yesterday, and it is scheduled to officially open on New Year's Day next year. The joint transport of goods at various stations also began yesterday. The China Merchants Bureau is scheduled to implement the Lian-Yungang to Guangzhou joint transport line today. The details are explored as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Opening</p>
<p>Since construction began on the western section of the Longhai Railway this spring, progress has been very rapid. By October 10, it reached Lintong and was opened to traffic first. The section of the project from Tonglin to Xi'an was only completed the other day and opened to traffic yesterday. Two ordinary passenger trains, two special passenger trains, two freight trains, and two passenger-freight mixed trains will be operated every day. At the same time, responsible and water-land joint transport will be handled, and it is scheduled to officially open to traffic on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Stations Along the Way</p>
<p>The road from Tongguan to Lintong has nine stations: Quandian, Huayin, Xiaying, Liuzhi, Huazhou, Shishui, Weinan, Lingkou, and Xinfengzhen. The road from Lintong to Xi'an has two stations: Yaocun and Baqiao, with a total length of 132 kilometers. The eastern section of the road from Haizhou Lianyungang to Tongguan is 916 kilometers long, and the entire line is 1,048 kilometers long, which is a trunk line from the western to eastern parts of our country, with Lianyungang as its throughput port.</p>
<p>China Merchants Joint Transport</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau was the earliest to handle water and land joint transport with the Longhai Railway. As the western section of the road progressed, passenger and freight water and land joint transport was already handled to Xi'an. The bureau is now opening a Lianyungang to Guangzhou joint transport line. The Gongping vessel was dispatched to Haizhou yesterday and will load goods there today and sail directly to Guangzhou, stopping only in Shanghai on the way.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi met with reporters from the Shenshi News Agency at the Central Bank yesterday and made important remarks as follows:</p>
<p>Preparing to Inspect Southern China's Finances</p>
<p>According to Finance Minister Kong, in order to understand the national finances and the abolition of excessive taxes in various provinces, he had previously visited North China and the Yangtze and Yellow River basins twice to conduct detailed inspections. He gained a deeper understanding of the economic and agricultural production conditions in various places. However, he has not been able to go to Southern China due to busy official duties. He recently heard that educational and rural economic construction projects in Southern China have made progress in recent years, and Mr. Zou Lu, the President of Zhongshan University in Guangdong, has also invited him to visit and give a speech. Therefore, he plans to take time off after the affairs of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank are slightly free to make a trip to inspect the financial and rural construction conditions in the Pearl River Basin and Guangdong and Guangxi. This will provide a reference for the central government to improve financial and economic facilities in Southern China, in addition to handling</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Central, China and Communications Banks to Release $10 Million Immediately <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>To be used by silver and money exchange houses who are members of the reserve pools for mortgage loans</p>
<p>If needed, the three banks can allocate more funds at any time.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: "Since the shortage of silver in Shanghai, the money market has become tight. Yesterday, the interest rate on foreign exchange interbank loans rose again to 40%. The Silver and Money Exchange Houses Association is doing its utmost to stabilize the financial situation. Considering that the combined reserves of the Banking Association Reserve Committee and the Money Exchange Reserve Pool are over $100 million, but consist of real estate deeds and securities, the Association has requested the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to allocate funds to member banks and money shops for temporary collateral use as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>The Three Banks Undertake the Task</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Banking Association, Chen Guangfu, and the Chairman of the Money Exchange Association, Qin Runqing, in order to regulate the financial market, consulted with the Director-General of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Xi Demao, the General Manager of the Bank of China, Zhang Gongquan, and the General Manager of the Bank of Communications, Tang Shoumin, to allocate funds to banks and money shops for temporary collateral use. It has been decided to provisionally allocate $10 million, with the Central Bank undertaking $5 million, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each undertaking $2.5 million.</p>
<p>To be Implemented Immediately</p>
<p>It is stipulated that the 65 member money shops belonging to the Money Exchange Association Reserve Pool and the 38 banks belonging to the Banking Association Reserve Committee can, from today onwards, mortgage real estate deeds, properties, securities (including stocks, government bonds, and treasury bills), raw gold, and raw silver to the above-mentioned two reserve institutions, which can then turn to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to mortgage for cash.</p>
<p>The Central Bank Takes Charge</p>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are entrusting the Central Bank to handle the $10 million in cash allocated to regulate the financial market. The President of the Central Bank, Kong Xiangxi, has instructed the Director-General of the Business Bureau, Xi Demao, to be responsible for the handling. The mortgage loans are of a temporary nature and will be stopped when the money market eases next spring. The interest rate will be 7-8%, to be determined based on the foreign exchange interbank lending rate on the day.</p>
<p>Additional Allocations at Any Time</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the Chairman of the Money Exchange Association, Qin Runqing, yesterday morning. According to him, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have provisionally allocated $10 million in cash to regulate the financial market. Although the specific amounts for banks and money shops have not been specified, it is generally $5 million for each. The interest rate is from 7-8%, to be determined at any time and will be implemented from today. If the total amount required by banks and money shops exceeds $10 million, they can negotiate with the three banks to increase the allocation. This measure is actually a precaution.</p>
<p>Ample Reserves</p>
<p>As of now, Shanghai's silver reserves total approximately $30 million. The reserves of each bank and money shop are quite ample. Moreover, the assets held by the reserve institutions of the two industries are mostly reliable real estate deeds, properties, and securities. With the decision on measures to regulate the financial market with the three banks, Shanghai's financial situation is guaranteed to be secure. As for the foreign exchange interbank lending rate rising to 40%, it is a normal occurrence; it falls when supply exceeds demand, and rises when demand exceeds supply. A foreign exchange interbank lending rate of 30-40% per year is extremely common.</p>
<p>Besides the above official duties, I will also take the opportunity to meet with old friends and comrades in Guangdong. It has been seven years since I left Guangdong, and I have not seen my old friends for a long time. Mr. Hu Hanmin is in Hong Kong, and of course, he will be among those I visit. Political issues will inevitably be discussed. However, I believe that the unity between the comrades in the Southwest and the Central Government has recently reached a satisfactory state. When I go there, I will only talk about how to further strengthen the spirit among comrades.</p>
<p>Possibility of Rewarding Silver Imports</p>
<p>When asked about the Ministry of Finance's handling of rewarding silver imports, Kong replied that because the United States implemented a policy of raising silver prices, those seeking to profit have been exporting silver one after another. To maintain the stability of the domestic economic foundation, the government had to impose silver export taxes and equalization taxes to prevent the continued outflow of silver. Recently, some in the banking sector have suggested rewarding silver imports. I believe this can be done. If someone is willing to import silver for legitimate business investment and undergoes legal registration procedures, the government can waive silver taxes and equalization taxes when it is re-exported in the future. This is reasonable and permissible.</p>
<p>Continuing Discussions with the US on the Silver Issue</p>
<p>Kong continued, "China and the United States are continuing to exchange notes on the silver issue. Because the United States' silver policy has had a trend of impacting the Chinese economy, the Chinese government has long expressed its sincere concerns to the United States. The United States has also expressed its willingness to cooperate with China to seek financial stability in China and reduce the financial difficulties caused by the US government's implementation of the silver policy. We are currently in negotiations. China and the United States are two major countries in the Pacific, and the relations between the two countries have always been harmonious. US President Roosevelt has always expressed sympathy for our country and has a deep understanding of the Chinese situation. Therefore, I firmly believe that, based on the importance of the economic ties between China and the United States, the United States will deeply consider the close relationship between the silver issue and China and seek appropriate measures to achieve the common goal of improving the international economic environment."</p>
<p>Handling of the Sino-Vietnamese Trade Agreement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Finally, Kong stated that the signing of the Sino-French Vietnamese trade agreement is being handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The French ambassador's visit the other day was regarding other matters and there were no important discussions related to the Sino-French trade agreement. It is also learned that Kong has been extremely busy with various official duties in Shanghai recently, so he will not be leaving Shanghai in the coming days. As for whether he will spend the New Year in Shanghai, Kong told reporters yesterday that he has not been able to completely confirm it.</p>

<p>Eight hundred bags transported by the Haiyuan vessel.</p>
<p>High quality, far superior to foreign sugar.</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Association reports: "The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, in view of the sharp increase in foreign sugar imports after the implementation of the new tariffs, which has greatly impacted domestic sugar, has specially dispatched Chairman Zheng Zenan to the sugar-producing areas of Guangdong for investigation a month ago to promote domestic goods and expand sales. He also contacted the Guangdong Provincial Soil Sugar Control Committee and the Guangdong Provincial National Goods Promotion Office, including Kuang Yifu, to jointly transport Guangdong sugar to Shanghai for sale, in order to prevent any leaks. According to inquiries made by reporters to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the first batch of 800 bags of Guangdong machine-made white sugar was transported to Shanghai by the Haiyuan vessel. The vessel entered the port at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Due to the rain, it was unable to unload, and will be stored after the warehouse is determined today or tomorrow. As for the second batch of 2,000 bags, a telegram has been sent requesting the Haili vessel to transport them, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company attaches great importance to this large-scale transport of Guangdong sugar to Shanghai and has designated the Hua warehouse as the storage location for strict safekeeping. It is heard that the domestic sugar will be continuously transported to Shanghai for sale in the future, and that the quality of Guangdong sugar is excellent and far superior to general imported goods."</p>

<p>And invited Shao Lizi and others to accompany him</p>
<p>Shanghai-based Suzhou gentry Chen Taoyi, Mu Ouchu, Jiang Wenyu, and others yesterday (27th) noon, gave a banquet at the Banking Association for Gu Zhutong, the Jiangxi Pacification Director, and also invited Shao Lizi, the Chairman of Shaanxi Province, Zhao Cihua, the former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, and Shu Shifu, the former Director of the Jiangsu Finance Department, to accompany him. There were more than 30 attendees. Zhang Gongquan gave a welcome speech, stating that when Mr. Gu Mozhi (Gu Zhutong) was in office in his hometown, it coincided with the First Shanghai Incident. Not only was the country at its most unfortunate juncture, but also Jiangsu Province at its most dangerous period. Gu calmly arranged for the aftermath and did his best to benefit the local area. Although he was soon transferred to Jiangxi Province to suppress bandits, the people of Jiangsu deeply missed him. Now that Gu has successfully suppressed the bandits and is in Shanghai, we are very fortunate to be able to express our respect and longing here. Gu then replied that he was very happy to be able to have a banquet with the gentlemen from his hometown. Although the banditry in Jiangxi Province has come to an end, there are still many matters that need to be taken care of, and the responsibility is very heavy. He hoped that everyone could not forget him and give him advice at any time. He welcomed everyone to visit and inspect the broken situation in the bandit areas. In short, the national crisis has not been resolved, and we should all work together for national rejuvenation. At around 3:00 PM, everyone dispersed happily. Gu then went to the Shi family's residence on Hartung Road with Zhao Cihua and others to pay their respects to Mr. Shi Liangcai.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Jardine Matheson's River Steamer Ruihe Ran Aground in Zhenjiang <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Currently Unloading Cargo</p>
<p>To Refloat the Ship</p>
<p>The British trading firm Jardine Matheson’s Changjiang liner, the Ruihe, loaded with cargo and passengers from Shanghai, was proceeding upstream on the morning of the 25th of this month. Around six or seven in the evening, the ship arrived at Zhenjiang. It was supposed to dock at the wharf to load and unload cargo and passengers, but for some reason, it suddenly ran aground on a shoal near the Taikoo lighter.</p>
<p>Unable to Move When it ran aground, the captain, Pace, initially intended to use full power to move the ship off the shoal and into the river. However, because the ship was fully loaded with cargo, the draft was heavy, and once it ran aground on the shoal, it could not move even a bit. At this time, the captain was overwhelmed and had no choice but to urgently inform the Zhenjiang branch and telegraph Shanghai for instructions.</p>
<p>Dispatching a Barge Upon Receiving the Telegram, the Shanghai office urgently telegraphed the Zhenjiang branch to quickly dispatch a barge to the site where the Ruihe was aground, quickly open the hatches and unload the cargo from the ship to reduce the load, so that the ship could float to the surface of the river, and then dispatch a tug to tow it out of danger. The ship is currently unloading cargo from the various holds, and it is expected that it will be cleared in about one or two days and then attempts will be made to rescue it from the shoal. However, passengers on board who could not wait for a long time transferred to the company’s other river steamers to proceed upstream to Wuhan. It is reported that the ship and the cargo have not been damaged.</p>

<p>Due to a Fire, Undergoing Repairs in Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Pacific Mail liner President Jefferson of the American trading firm Dollar Steamship Lines, after arriving in Shanghai from the United States on the 12th of this month, sailed to Hong Kong and Luzon. On the afternoon of the 14th, when it was approximately one hundred nautical miles from Hong Kong, a fire suddenly broke out in the hold. Fortunately, the ship's firefighting equipment was very complete. As soon as the fire alarm was heard, all the crew members worked hard to put out the fire. Although the fire was quite intense, it was eventually extinguished. Only a portion of the cargo in the cargo hold was damaged. The shipowner telegraphed both the Hong Kong and Shanghai offices and was ordered to temporarily stop going to Luzon. It was ordered to proceed directly to Hong Kong, first unload the cargo that had been burned and damaged by water, and transfer all cargo and passengers bound for Luzon to other ships in Hong Kong for onward travel. The ship then entered the shipyard in Hong Kong for repairs and only yesterday sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai today and sail to Seattle. It will increase its speed en route in order to arrive in the United States on schedule.</p>

According to a person in charge of the bureau, savings and remittance services in the bandit areas have been suspended for a long time. Now that our troops are recovering the areas one after another, the people are suffering from extreme economic hardship due to the long-term banditry.

<p>Establishes a Factory Affairs Improvement Committee to Plan Everything</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report: Industrial magnate Rong Zongjing, recognizing the decline of the domestic cotton yarn industry and the dumping of foreign cotton in China, and in order to remedy the situation, previously went to various cotton-producing areas in the Northwest to conduct inspections. After returning to Shanghai, he recognized that the cotton-producing areas in the Northwest had greatly increased cotton production this year. If further improvements were made, domestic cotton yarn could be self-sufficient and there would be no need to rely on foreign cotton. At the same time, he saw that the internal equipment of the yarn factories run by Chinese businessmen was adhering to old methods and was not being improved. Therefore, he initiated the establishment of a Factory Affairs Improvement Committee, recommending nine cotton yarn industry magnates as members, with Rong Weiren as the chairman. The committee discusses matters related to the improvement of yarn factories. It has now been established and has held several meetings to discuss matters related to the internal improvement of yarn factories, such as factory management, loan interest, etc. Currently, plans are being discussed one by one.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Consultation to Withdraw the Order Banning Firecrackers <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to consult with the Public Security Bureau to withdraw the order banning firecrackers. The original text stated: "Submitting a request for the matter... (omission) Upon investigation, the reason for the ban, according to reports, is nothing more than that it is entirely a form of consumption, harmful and without benefit. In fact, firecrackers are needed for embellishment and entertainment during seasonal festivals. Such customs have been passed down for thousands of years. Historically, they have never been banned except during periods of martial law. It is true that the sound of firecrackers during seasonal festivals is familiar to the people. The so-called 'causing alarm and sudden misunderstanding' may occur during times of panic, but there is no such concern during times of peace. This is the reason why they are banned during martial law but not during times of peace. If it is said to be useless consumption, then strictly speaking, apart from cloth, silk, rice, and wheat, all other slightly luxurious items can be said to be useless consumption. The state and the people rectify customs and traditions, only using frugality to bring the people into line, and have never heard of issuing laws to impose strict prohibitions. Moreover, in terms of the consumption of firecrackers, they are only occasionally set off during weddings, funerals, celebrations, and seasonal festivals. In terms of the degree of consumption, it is far below that of luxurious items. Considering the recently popular imported consumer goods, the loss of money and the consumption of people's minds are a hundred times greater than that of firecrackers. There are occasional local people who earnestly advise against them, but the responsible authorities, concerned with tax revenue, issue documents to protect them. In all these situations, the details are seen in public reports. Only the single item of firecrackers is worried about excessively, prohibiting their use, and even detaining and fining people. Is this the way of public impartiality and forgiveness? The Book of History says, 'Government lies in nourishing the people.' Now that all industries are declining, the government is limited by its financial resources and cannot broadly plan livelihoods for the common people. How can it make so many changes, causing those who already have jobs to be driven into unemployment? Even if these unemployed workers can all endure cold and hunger and not mistakenly take the path of banditry, leading to a social crisis, but to apply the ancient saying of 'if one man is not provided for, the blame rests with the ruler,' can one be without guilt? In summary, if this action is taken, it will only add countless unemployed industrial and commercial workers to Shanghai, causing a hundred harms and no benefits. Due to our responsibilities, we dare to present this petition. We earnestly request your Bureau to review and consult with the Public Security Bureau to withdraw the order banning firecrackers in order to maintain the vitality of the industry. We await your urgent instructions. Respectfully submitted."</p>

(3) Disinfection work should be carried out in all cattle farms and cattle pens, that is, cleaning up accumulated dirt and spraying disinfectant.

<p>The Fifth District Branch of the Tangjiawan Second Special District Citizens' Association of the French Concession sent a letter to the Superintendent of the French Police Station yesterday, stating: "Respectfully reporting that the members of our association have repeatedly stated that there are few police posts on the roads in our district, and incidents of robbery, theft, and disturbances by vagrants are frequently heard of. As the end of the lunar year is approaching, the time when thieves are rampant, if precautions are not taken, there will be hidden worries about public security. Please ask your station to ask the authorities to pay attention to winter defense, increase the number of police posts, and especially pay attention to small hotels and public bathhouses, ordering them to be closely monitored in order to maintain security." It was previously reported that the Caitou Road and Kangti Road area in our district rarely have police posts guarding them. Our association previously requested the addition of police posts based on the requests of the shops on that road, and a letter has been sent. However, it has not yet been approved, which is deeply regrettable. Considering the unstable situation and the decline of business, the time of cold winter, and the rise of thieves, it is better to prevent than to capture after the fact, so that people can live in peace and the area can be stabilized. Therefore, we dare to request your superintendent to grant winter defense, approve the addition of police posts at key road intersections, and select and dispatch detectives to patrol in shifts to provide defense and maintain the area, so as to prevent public grievances. We also hope for an immediate response to comfort the public's expectations. We offer our highest regards."</p>

<h3 id="e152">Exhibition of Coins From Past Dynasties <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>To Be Held at the YMCA Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Wenqi, a coin collector, will hold an exhibition of coins from past dynasties at the YMCA in Baxianqiao from tomorrow (29th) to the 31st. The exhibition will be open from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM daily. The origins of the exhibition are stated as follows: Coins are relied upon by mankind for their livelihood. From ancient times to the present, they have been circulated continuously. Therefore, collecting coins used in past dynasties can create a coin history. How the culture of our country has progressed over four thousand years can also be seen from the coins of past dynasties. Tracing back to ancient times, people tied knots to record events. They traded goods for goods in the market, and there were no coins to speak of. Later, feeling the inconvenience of division, the system of currency was created. However, due to changes in the ideas of the times, the form, text, and raw materials of currency also changed accordingly. In terms of form, there are distinctions between knives, cloths, and springs. In terms of text, there are distinctions between ancient seal script, large seal script, small seal script, clerical script, regular script, running script, and cursive script. In terms of raw materials, the mixing of five metals, red copper, purple copper, bronze, white copper, iron, lead, gold, and silver also varied according to the evolution of civilization. The same knife also has differences in length, short, width, and narrowness, form, and weight. The same cloth also has differences in the flatness, sharpness, and roundness of the shoulders and feet. The same spring also has inconsistencies in the presence or absence of inner and outer rims and the squareness and roundness of the holes. The raw materials, text, size, and weight are not fixed and unchanging, which is enough for us to conduct detailed research. It is a pity that the people of our country ignore it, and unscrupulous merchants only care about profit. They have almost exhausted the most valuable coins in Chinese history for foreigners to collect. Moreover, domestic coins are destroyed to extract copper to make other utensils, so that the coins of past dynasties in my country with a unified system are difficult to find in museums, libraries, and exhibition halls in the country, which is regrettable. I have traveled extensively in Yan, Liao, Qin, and Long for more than twenty years, collecting various ancient coins everywhere. After a long time, the number has been quite large. It has long been appreciated by fellow enthusiasts. The inscriptions and rubbings compiled by Shiquan Cangquan have also received considerable criticism from contemporary appraisers. In the northwest, where the origin of our country's culture is earliest, it is still regarded as rare and valuable, so it must be cherished and valued. At a time when we are paying attention to preserving antiques, we feel that it is necessary to contribute to society. I have specially compiled, collated, and exhibited them in chronological order. I hope that you gentlemen who are interested in Chinese history and relics will come and guide me. I am very grateful. Respectfully, Yang Wenqi of Shiquan.</p>

<p>Each Time It Dredges 4,000 Tons, Specially for Dredging the Shoals</p>
<p>The Parts Will be Assembled and Shipped to China in February of Next Year</p>
<p>The world's largest dredging vessel ordered by the Dredging Bureau from Germany some time ago is about to be completed, according to the bureau. The dredging vessel is scheduled to leave Germany for China in early February next year. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Dredging Plan</p>
<p>The Bureau believes that the shoals and reefs at the mouth of the Yangtze River, located in the center of the Yangtze River estuary, occupy a large area and obstruct traffic, so that huge seagoing vessels cannot enter the port. Even the larger vessels currently sailing in the Yangtze River and the Huangpu River must wait for the tide to rise before they can pass, otherwise they will be in danger of running aground. The Bureau's Chief Engineer, Mr. Chantrill, after years of research, has determined that most of the shoals are composed of mud. He has ordered the world's largest dredging vessel from Germany, planning to dredge on a large scale to facilitate traffic. According to Mr. Chantrill, the dredging plan for the shoals will be divided into two phases. The first phase is tentatively set for five years, and the second phase will be determined based on the work done in the first phase.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Ship to China</p>
<p>The ship was designed by Chief Engineer Chantrill and built by the Schichau shipyard in Elbing, Germany. It was agreed that the goods would be delivered in Shanghai and represented by the German company Siemens. The ship is 360 feet long and 60 feet wide. Each time, it can dredge 4,000</p>

<p>The Procuratorate Conducted a Strict Investigation of the Guards on Duty Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Zhikui, the owner of Qianfengtai Candle Shop at No. 52 Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, a Ningbo native, returned to the shop from outside at about 9:00 PM on April 14th of last year. He detoured through a small alley next to the north side of the shop to return to his home upstairs. While walking in the alley, he was suddenly shot by a thug, hitting his throat and killing him. Chen Qiancheng, the manager of the shop, heard the alarm and rushed out to help, but was also injured. Afterwards, the French police arrested the murderer Zhu Quanxing, seized two guns and dozens of bullets, and sent him to the Second Special Court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. The third trial ended, upholding the original verdict. Afterwards, based on Zhu's confession, the police dispatched detectives to Ningbo to investigate and arrest the accomplice of the murderer. On November 18th, they finally arrested Chen Jinlan (also known as Li Jinlan, nicknamed "Snake Skin" Jinlan, 32 years old this year) in the countryside.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Transfer and Detention to Shanghai <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The offender was escorted to the Second Special District Court, tried and sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment. The offender did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Chen still refused to accept this and appealed to the Supreme Court. Therefore, the Chen offender was detained in Cell No. 11 of the Heavy Sentence Division of the Second District Court Detention Center. Now, the Supreme Court has rendered a judgment, changing the sentence to twelve years of imprisonment. The judgment was recently sent to the Third Branch of the High Court, which dispatched police to serve it on the Chen offender. It was expected that the case would be proposed soon and sent to prison for execution. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, between 3:00 AM and 7:20 AM, before the opening of the cell, taking advantage of the fact that the three fellow inmates, Zhang, Wu, and Zhu, were sound asleep and the guards were negligent, he twisted open the iron door of the cell and escaped without a trace. When the cell was opened at 7:20 AM, the inmates and guards in the cell saw him lying on the ground,</p>
<p>Calling and Shouting, No Response</p>
<p>They lifted the blanket to observe and discovered that he had used clothes and pillows to cover himself inside the blanket, pretending to be a human figure sleeping, in order to deceive people. The plan was ingenious. After the guard, Fang Yuqi, discovered it, the person had already escaped without a trace. An inspection of the inner and outer iron doors showed that they were still sealed and not locked as before, making it difficult to understand the path of his escape. He immediately reported the information to Warden Gao Xiaohe. Mr. Gao was furious upon receiving the report. Considering that the duty officers and others were negligent, he immediately ordered the detention of the six guards on duty before and after, Yang Xingcun (34 years old, from Shandong), Wang Guanghe (34 years old, from Nantong), Fang Yuqi (40 years old, from Anhui), Han Haorui (23 years old, from Hangzhou), Yan Ling (21 years old, from Zhenjiang), and Zhou Wenjin (20 years old, from Hebei).</p>
<h3 id="e156">All Detained Together <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>A formal document was prepared and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court for investigation. On one hand, Warden Gao personally went to the Second Special District Court and the Third Branch of the High Court at 9:00 AM to report to the presidents of the two courts and request instructions. At noon, Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by clerk Zhao Yifen, specially opened the Second Criminal Court and ordered all the guards to be brought to the court for investigation. According to Yang Xingcun's statement, "I took over the shift from Wang Guanghe from 11:00 PM to 3:00 AM. At that time, the Chen offender was sitting at the door on the floor. I told him to sleep. When I left the shift, there were a total of twenty-three inmates in all the cells, no less or more. I handed them over to the person taking over the shift." Wang Guanghe stated, "I was on duty from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM. During my duty hours, I saw four people in Cell No. 11: Chen Jinlan, Zhang Asi, Wu Shaoting, and Zhu Quanxing. Chen was sitting on the floor sewing clothes and even talking to Wang Xinggao, an inmate in Cell No. 12 next door. I am only responsible for</p>
<h3 id="e157">Four Hours <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>of responsibility within the cell. I don't know anything beyond that." Fang Yuqi stated, "I was on duty from 3:00 AM to 7:00 AM. When I came on duty, I saw four inmates in Cell No. 11 sleeping inside. Chen was sleeping on the floor near the door. At 7:20 AM, when I opened the cell and called him to wash his face, I discovered that the Chen offender had escaped. I immediately reported to the head of the cell. The keys to the cell door are managed by the director. At 5:00 PM the night before, I closed and locked it, and Chen was still inside." Han Haorui, Yan Ling, and Zhou Wenjin all stated together, "We are all specially in charge of the main gate post and also in charge of the east end iron gate. We are usually not allowed to enter the cells. During our duty hours, we did not see anyone coming out," etc. At this point in the interrogation, the official instructed Yang and the other six to be returned to detention to await investigation before further interrogation. The court then adjourned.</p>
<p>tons, with a draft of 18 feet. The propulsion engine and mud pump each have a horsepower of 2,500. The construction cost is as high as 22.5 million yuan in national currency. It is now learned that the main projects of the entire ship have been completed, and the installation of internal parts and painting work are being rushed. It is expected that it will be fully completed by the end of next month (January next year), and it is scheduled to be shipped to China by Deqi Dingxing in early February next year. It is estimated that the sea journey will take about 70 days, arriving in Shanghai in mid-April next year.</p>

<p>Gong Jinlin Sues the Court</p>
<p>A shocking incident of a police chief firing shots out of grudge occurred in Yangjiadu Town, Pudong. Fortunately, no one was injured. The situation is recorded as follows: Gong Jinlin, a local resident, 50 years old, runs a large Longyang general merchandise store with a double storefront at No. 205 Yangjiadu Town, Pudong. Since its establishment, it has been operating for 30 years, and the business is quite prosperous. Late at night on the 28th of last month, the neighbors of the store heard gunshots in their sleep. However, since no accidents occurred the next day, they did not investigate the source of the gunshots. Recently, Gong Jinlin, the owner of Dalong Store, hired someone to draft a complaint to the prosecutor of the local court, accusing Wu Tianzhi, the police chief of the Yangjiadu Police Station, of attempted murder, requesting a fair investigation and prosecution. The complaint roughly stated, "The plaintiff has been running Dalong Store for many years. The defendant, Wu Tianzhi, once came to buy foreign cloth on credit. The plaintiff politely refused because there had been no previous dealings. The defendant left resentfully. Furthermore, because the plaintiff married off his daughter on November 25th of this year (the 19th day of the tenth lunar month), the defendant suddenly came to lift the sedan door when the bridal sedan arrived at the Yangjiadu Wharf, openly</p>

<p>Entrusted to the Municipal Health Laboratory for Sale</p>
<p>The Department of Health uses material science methods to extract egg yolk extract from soybeans, which can cure nicotine addiction. This medicine is a completely plant-based product, which is easily digested, improves appetite, ensures peaceful sleep, and naturally reduces the amount of cigarettes consumed daily and generates disgust. It is truly the only good medicine for quitting smoking currently available. During the period of use, if there are any questions, you can write to the Technical Office of the Department for an answer based on the facts. Each box contains 18 pieces, to be taken three times a day, two pieces each time. There are salty and sweet flavors. You can quit after taking about three or four boxes. The price is set at one yuan and eight jiao per box. It is now entrusted to the Municipal Health Laboratory on Xinguangdong Street, Zhabei, to sell it on its behalf.</p>

On the 28th of the same month, around 2:00 AM, he placed a ladder against the plaintiff's wall to open the window. The plaintiff woke up in his sleep and asked who it was. The defendant said, 'Be careful,' and fired a shot, followed by another. The neighbors on the left and right all heard it. Zhou, a nearby patrol officer, came to investigate and saw him carrying the ladder away. At dawn, the plaintiff reported the above situation to Inspector Sun of the local Public Security Bureau. After many days, he assumed that nothing would happen. Unexpectedly, on the 8th of this month, the defendant said to the plaintiff, 'Don't be afraid that you will</p>
<p>sue the superiors, be careful to take your life.' The defendant also said to Lin, 'I will beat him to death,' and so on. The defendant is currently the police chief of the Yangjiadu Police Station of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and carries a gun with him. Since he has the intention to kill, he can cause the plaintiff's death at any time. Having no other choice, I can only appeal to your court to approve the arrest of the defendant to be brought to trial and punished according to the crime he deserves." After receiving the complaint, the court issued summons yesterday to both parties to appear in court for questioning and verification.</p>

<p>The Main Criminals Zheng Xingwu and Others Arrested</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyu, owner of the Pingmo Silk Factory on Zhoujiazui Road and the Siyi Silk Factory on Kunming Road, whose residence is located at No. 10, Lane 423, Kunming Road, had his four-year-old son, Zhang Yangge, suddenly kidnapped by four kidnappers at 1:10 PM on the 12th of this month, who deceived [them] to open the door under the pretext of delivering red eggs. Zhang reported [the incident] to the police station for investigation and arrest. It has now been learned by Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the General Police Station, that Zheng Xingwu from Shaoxing is the main criminal in the case. Therefore, he dispatched Chinese Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, and Wang Chengying to No. 10, Lane 120, Wuzhou Road the day before yesterday to arrest Zheng and bring him back to the police station, along with Zheng's mistress, Xu Xiaxian (also known as Xiaxia, 25 years old, from Shaoxing). After strict interrogation, Zheng confessed to two locations where the hostage was hidden. However, after the detectives went to investigate, the results were all negative. Zheng and Xu were separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer of the police station, explained the previous situation, stating that the hostage in this case had not yet been rescued and requesting permission to detain the two defendants in order to continue the investigation. Judge Feng Shide questioned the two defendants and ordered that they be detained and the hearing rescheduled.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Three Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yi Turned Pale Upon Hearing the Verdict</p>
<p>His Wives and Concubines All Sobbed</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, head of the Fangshuo Spirit Troupe, a comedy, drama, song, and dance troupe on the roof garden of the Sun Sun Company, is a 43-year-old man from Hangzhou. He was recently accused by Yi Baozhu, his 19-year-old cousin, of forcibly raping her and then monitoring her, preventing her from free movement. The police were dispatched to Yi's residence at No. 147, Baxianfangkou, Huagen Road, at 11:00 AM on the 11th of this month to arrest Yi and bring him in for investigation along with 13 young women from his acting troupe. It was also discovered that he had raped Li Xiaozhen, the 13-year-old younger sister of his concubine, Yi Meimei. It was also found that Yi had funded the purchase of two women, Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu, who were sent to the Second Special District Court. The lawyer representing the Police Department filed a public prosecution on charges of violating public morals under Articles 240 and 243 of the Criminal Code, and on charges of harming family under Article 257, Paragraph 2, and on charges of restricting freedom under Article 316. Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen were interrogated, and their legal representatives, Yi Hu (Fangshuo's stepmother) and Li Duofu, hired lawyers to appear in court, requesting that the charges be withdrawn and that the two girls be allowed to be taken back. The court granted this request and then proceeded to try the charges of harming family and restricting freedom. The defendant was defended by lawyers Sha Xunyi and Hu Jue. Judge Zhang Chaozuo had declared the debate closed, and the defendant was transferred to the detention center to await sentencing. The previous reports had already covered all the details. Yesterday was the date for sentencing, and Yi's family and friends all came to the court to listen. At 10:00 AM, Judge Qiu Huan Ying, acting on behalf of the First Criminal Court, ordered the police to go to the detention center to bring Yi Fangshuo to the court. The defendant's defense lawyers also arrived to await the verdict. The official briefly questioned the defendant about his age, origin, address, and occupation, and then announced the verdict: Yi Fangshuo is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for depriving others of their freedom of movement by illegal means. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from the prison term at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The charges of harming family are acquitted, and the charges of violating public morals are not accepted. After the verdict was announced, the defendant was returned to the detention center to await instructions during the appeal period. Yi's face changed drastically upon hearing the verdict, and his eyes were filled with tears. He was taken away by the police and returned to detention. Yi's family, one wife and three concubines, all covered their faces and sobbed upon hearing the verdict, and left dejectedly.</p>

<p>The Appeal Has Already Been Submitted</p>
<h3 id="e163">Valuable Diamond Ring Lost Case <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Cannot Escape the Law</p>
<p>Whereabouts of the Strange-Looking Man Unknown</p>
<p>Ma Xintian, a jewelry broker, had a diamond ring with a diamond weighing 16.75 carats. Because he wanted to sell it, he gave it to his colleague Feng Zichuan to sell on his behalf. On October 16th of this year, Feng placed the ring in his sock and went to the Yueyuli brothel on Yunnan Road to sell it. When he arrived in the alley, he suddenly could not find it. Ma found out about this and negotiated with Feng, who compensated him with 8,500 yuan. At that time, the ring was picked up by Lu Asan, a rickshaw puller from Haimen at No. 26 Qingyuan Street, Tong Yongtai. At that time, Lu was waiting in the alley because his master was playing in the brothel. Lu was overjoyed at obtaining the precious ornament and could not keep it a secret. The next day, he discussed it with his fellow townsman, Lu Ada, also a rickshaw puller, and showed him the ring for mutual admiration. However, both were doubtful and could not identify whether it was genuine or fake. They went to Haining to briefly consult with Xing Pawnshop to ask them to determine the authenticity. The pawnbroker glanced at the ring and told them that if they wanted to determine whether it was genuine or fake, it would take a considerable period of time and could not be decided hastily. The two Lus then took the ring and went to Hongxing Pawnshop on North Sichuan Road, still asking for an estimate. Wu Shangshou, the young owner of the pawnshop, used a microscope to examine the diamond and then took the ring upstairs. At this moment, a strange-looking man with a protruding lower lip suddenly walked into Hongxing and expressed his desire to buy the ring. Wu Shangshou then came downstairs and told the two Lus that if they were willing to sell it, it was worth six yuan. The two Lus refused and took the original ring back. On November 12th, Lu Asan happened to be standing in front of Tong Yongtai, looking around, when he saw Wu Shangshou walking around the area, lingering for a long time. Lu initially did not pay attention to it. That night, the strange-looking man he had seen before became an uninvited guest and visited Lu Asan, directly saying that he wanted to buy the ring. Lu said that it was inconvenient to talk in detail at this time and agreed to meet at the Hujiang Hotel the next day in the name of Chen Nianlin. When the time came, Lu went as agreed, carrying the treasure with him. Wu Shangshou also arrived and valued it at 900 yuan. The strange-looking man paid the price and took the ring, Wu left, and Lu also left with the money and shared it with Ada. More than a month passed, and the two Lus did not see the owner pursue the matter, thinking that it was safe. Unexpectedly, recently, Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Cui Jinchuan of the Zhabei Police Station found out about it and immediately arrested the two Lus and questioned them about the details. The two Lus were guilty of illegally appropriating lost property and were brought to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Xiang Yinghua interrogated them. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the police station, asked to punish the two defendants for the crime under Article 358 of the Criminal Code, and Detective Zhang reported the details of the investigation of the case, presenting a savings passbook with more than 600 yuan found in Lu Ada's possession as evidence. Wu Shangshou, accompanied by his lawyer Jiang Yiping, voluntarily surrendered himself. The owner, Feng Zichuan, also hired lawyer Fan Gang to appear in court, stating that Feng had already compensated Ma Xintian with 8,500 yuan, so he specifically filed a claim for damages against the two defendants, ordering them to repay 8,500 yuan. However, the strange-looking man was still unknown, and there was no way to summon him. Judge Xiang questioned the defendants one by one and ordered the two Lus to pay a bail of 1,000 yuan each. Wu Shangshou left to await further interrogation.</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang from Shaoxing was previously accused of selling Japanese goods in the Yue Lai South Goods Store on Guangdong Road and threatened with a bomb. However, he was careless in throwing the bomb. In addition to injuring Ding Yanzhi and other shop assistants, Liang also injured his left and right hands. The police station sent him to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Liang to six months of imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence. Subsequently, the Public Works Department disagreed and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The result was still the original sentence. However, according to Liang's statement reported in various newspapers yesterday, the appeal period for this case has now passed, and the police station will no longer appeal. However, according to Mr. Wang, the lawyer of the Legal Department of the Public Works Department, he told reporters that after the Second Branch of the High Court served the judgment on the 14th of this month, the Public Works Department submitted a statement to the Second Branch of the High Court on the 17th, declaring an appeal, and rushed to draft the reasons for the appeal. The reasons have now been drafted and were submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday to be forwarded to the Supreme Court for appeal. Therefore, Liang's claim that the police station will no longer appeal is not a fact.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Drug Manufacturing Factory Found on Meibage Road <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Manufacturers Fled in Advance</p>
<p>Countless Drugs and Equipment Seized</p>
<p>In recent months, the public concession has cracked down on several privately established drug manufacturing facilities. However, the manufacturers are mostly resourceful and well-informed, and they often escape in advance. Therefore, these people only sacrifice drugs and manufacturing tools, while they themselves remain at large. Once the rumors subside slightly, it is not difficult to make a comeback, so that the production of drugs is still endless, and there is no hope of clearing it up. Recently, there are as many as three drug manufacturing factories set up by these people in No. 90 Lane (i.e., Xiang Kangli) on Meibage Road, Xinzha. The working hours are often late at night and extremely secretive. Even the residents in the same neighborhood cannot know. One night, Wu Changkai, a detective of the Xinzha Police Station, happened to pass by the area and smelled an unusually strong odor of opium-like morphine emanating from the windows. He knew that there must be a den of drugs in the lane, so he started investigating. After several days of investigation, he found out that there were indeed three drug dens in the lane. According to intelligence, the Baoshan police chief requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant. At 5:00 PM the day before, he went with Chinese and Western detectives to search each address one by one. Only in the kitchen of No. 70, a drug manufacturing factory was found. Eighteen pounds of heroin, ten large glass bottles, five vats, twenty wooden boxes, twenty-two empty alcohol cans, two small stoves, three kerosene stoves, and two basins were seized. The other two locations had already been emptied, and the manufacturers had fled without a trace. The Chinese and Western detectives then transported the seized items back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, requested the First Special District Court to approve the detention of the items, awaiting the arrest of the perpetrators to be punished.</p>

<p>Falling Onto the Roof of a Car</p>
<p>Died Instantly After Rolling on the Ground</p>
<p>Yong An Company on Nanjing Road is currently building a new building nearby and installing a floating bridge on Zhejiang Road, more than 100 feet above the ground, so that the old and new buildings can be connected in the future. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wu Changqi, a 23-year-old ironworker from Haimen, intended to climb this floating bridge to play in the Tianyun Building on the fifth floor of the company. However, due to carelessness, he lost his footing and fell, first falling onto the roof of car No. 795, which was stopped on the roadside, and then rolling on the ground, resulting in immediate death. After the Zhabei Police Station received the report, it ordered detectives to go to investigate and then transported the body to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to go to the morgue to</p>

<p>Volunteering to Pretend to Negotiate on His Behalf</p>
<p>Unemployed for a Long Time, Committing This Illegal Act</p>
<p>Wu Xingkang from Ningbo, 47 years old, has been running Jingmei Cake and Dumpling Shop on the west end of Xiaocai Market, Baxianqiao, Kaizi Road, French Concession, for many years. The business is still going smoothly, and his family also lives in the shop. There is a pavilion room in the remaining house, which is rented to Cui Ziguang from Suzhou. Cui is 25 years old this year and used to work in a bakery on Tianzhutang Street. Because he stopped for too long, he has been unemployed recently. He lives with his old mother, wife, and children, a family of four. Now, because of economic difficulties, his life has been greatly affected, so he came up with a strange idea. Seeing that the second landlord, Wu Xingkang, the owner of Jingmei Cake and Dumpling Shop, was</p>

<p>He started to have bad intentions. On the 27th and 29th of last month, and the 7th and 9th of this month, he wrote four threatening letters in a row and sent them to Wu by mail. The letters were falsely signed by Zheng Jinbiao, falsely claiming that our team recently had financial difficulties and had to borrow 5,000 yuan. Once the funds are sufficient, we will return the full amount, etc. All four letters specified the meeting place as the Public Education Cooperative in the Wenmiao Park on Wenmiao Road in the Chinese area. If you do not agree, we will deal with it with drastic measures, etc. After receiving the letters, Wu was panicked and did not dare to go to negotiate rashly, leaving them aside. Cui secretly spied on Wu's expression and saw Wu's face show</p>
<h3 id="e168">Anxious Look <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Cui wrote another letter, changing the meeting place to the Deyilou Teahouse in the Yuyuan Garden in the city. On the 20th, he learned that Wu had received the fifth letter, Cui immediately volunteered to make a self-recommendation in front of Wu, willing to go to negotiate with the bandits. Wu fully agreed and entrusted him to try his best to find a way to get rid of the trouble, promising to thank him afterward. Cui then excused himself and returned to report to Wu in the evening, saying that the other party wanted at least 500 yuan. Wu replied that he did not have this ability and entrusted Cui to find a way to reduce it. Cui still pretended to agree and made an appointment to hear back the next day. On the 21st, Cui went out and came back, telling Wu that he had negotiated and that at least 150 yuan was needed and could not be reduced any further. Wu, in order to</p>

<p>and avoid escalating the matter, reluctantly agreed and gave Cui 70 yuan in cash that night, entrusting him to pay the remaining 80 yuan the next day, promising to pay it after he had raised the money. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was learned by Jin Jiulin, the inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Police Station. He immediately dispatched Detectives Zhou Buguang and Deputy Detective Cai Jinzhang to Wu Xingkang's place to investigate the details of Wu entrusting Cui to negotiate and pay the money, and obtained five threatening letters, instructing Wu to keep the matter strictly confidential in order to seize the bandits at the right time. On the morning of the 22nd, Cui carried the money and left the house. At that time, Zhou and Cai, two detectives, and Bao Tan, Zhu Juwen, secretly followed Cui to see what was going on. How could Cui, who was really empty-handed, confess on his own to writing letters to Wu and Kang, threatening to defraud them of money without denying it, and asking for leniency and release? The detectives then arrested him and</p>

<p>The money was brought to the Chenxiangge Public Security Bureau Second District First Branch for deposit and reported back to the police chief, requesting a formal document from the Second Special District Court. The original detectives went to the Public Security Bureau to transfer Cui to the case. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated him. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the police station, explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation, and presented five threatening letters. Cui Ziguang, the defendant, confessed that he was unemployed and burdened by the economy and lack of livelihood, so he wrote threatening letters to defraud money without denying it, saying that he wrote all five letters himself, etc. After verifying the confession in court, it was ordered that the case be investigated and re-interrogated on the 31st, and the defendant was returned to detention.</p>

Yesterday, my brother told me that because it was raining, work was suspended for a day, so I did not know that he planned to climb the Tianyun Building to play. Later, while we were having dinner, someone caught a glimpse and came to tell me, and I found out. Now, I request to be allowed to claim the body, etc. After Tang Jun obtained the statement, he ordered that Wu Changqi, the deceased, was a male and had died from injuries sustained in a fall. The body was handed over to his brother, Wu Lianda, to sign a bond and take back for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Double Track Between Shanghai and Nanxiang to Be Completed Next Month</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the transfer of vehicles between the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways and the Beijing-Wuhu and Tianjin-Pukou Railways, the Ministry of Railways has decided to build a central station in Beijing and has instructed the two bureaus to be responsible for planning. According to the news from the bureau, various construction matters are actively underway. The laying of double tracks on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway from Shanghai to Nanxiang to facilitate the movement of vehicles has been 80 to 90 percent completed since construction began and is expected to be completed next month. As for the full double-tracking of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, it will depend on future resources due to funding constraints. The railway is also striving to improve the equipment at each station for the safety of passengers on both railways. Mr. Huang Boqiao, the director of the bureau, was sent abroad to inspect and has been abroad for half a year. He is currently inspecting in Germany and will leave Germany to inspect Denmark, Poland, and other countries, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Italy in March next year.</p>

<p>The parcel of land located at No. 160, the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, is subject to the pre-determined plan to widen the road and should be acquired, measuring one mu, two fen, and eight li. The Public Works Bureau is in consultation with Mrs. Hardoon, the landowner, regarding this matter. However, the Bureau has not been able to agree to the compensation demanded by the landowner. This case has now been submitted to the Land Committee for arbitration.</p>
<p>It has been investigated that the building located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road had an incident on March 20th of this year at around 6:00 PM, where bricks and plaster collapsed, injuring several pedestrians on Nanjing Road. Traffic on that section was significantly hampered for several days thereafter. The Public Works Bureau immediately sent personnel to inspect the building, and the owner also arranged for repairs. However, this parcel of land was already designated for acquisition in the 1926 plan, measuring one mu, two fen, and eight hao, in preparation for widening the road. The land had long belonged to Mr. Hardoon. If this acquisition is implemented, it would greatly benefit traffic flow. However, it must wait until the parcel of land at No. 162 further east is also acquired according to plan and aligned with the Electricity Company's building before the overall traffic flow of Nanjing Road can be significantly improved.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Separate Interrogation Was Conducted by the First Special Court</p>
<p>Both Suspects Shifted Blame in Hopes of Evading Responsibility</p>
<p>Indian Constable No. 258 of the Yangshupu Police Station was fatally shot in a vital area near a foreign-owned sock factory on Hejian Road at 10:45 PM on the 9th of this month. The perpetrators were at large. The day before yesterday at around 10:00 AM, Chinese Detective Liu Wenzao and Western Detective White apprehended a suspect named Zhou Hongtian from Taizhou at the corner of Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII. Upon interrogation, they learned that an accomplice, Wang Jinsheng (also from Taizhou), resided at No. 267 Huangpu Road in the French Concession. Subsequently, he was also apprehended on Rue du Consulat and both were taken to the Yangshupu Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court for separate interrogation. Mr. Li Zhishan, the lawyer for the Public Works Bureau, stated that in their statements at the police station, the two defendants shifted blame to each other, both claiming Wang was the perpetrator, while Wang claimed that Zhou initiated the act and that he held the gun, which bore the inscription "Shanghai." It has been verified that the gun belonged to Luo Xingfa, who has already been summoned and the gun is currently in the custody of the French police for examination. It will be presented to the court at the next hearing. At the time of the incident, a gray bowler hat was found lying on the roadside nearby. Wang claimed that Zhou was wearing it at the time and threw it on the ground after the crime. The case is requested to be postponed, etc. The hat was presented for inspection. When questioned, Zhou Hongtian claimed that he was invited by Wang Jinsheng to visit the area and they first had a meager meal in a lane in nearby Huaxingfang. Afterwards, they walked together to Linqing Road, where they encountered the Indian constable, who stopped them for inspection. He then took out a gun and opened fire, firing five or six shots. Upon seeing this, he immediately fled and returned to his home at No. 2 Dexingfang, Yangshupu. The next day at around 2:00 PM, Wang came to his house and told him to go to the French Concession.</p>
<p>In his statement, Wang Jinsheng said that at 5:00 PM that afternoon, he met Zhou at the entrance of the Great World and told him to visit a friend in Yangshupu. While walking near the scene of the incident, they encountered an Indian constable. Zhou immediately pulled out a handgun with the inscription "Shanghai" and tried to fire it at the constable. He told him not to, but Zhou did not listen and fired one shot at the constable. He was frightened and immediately fled back to his home in the French Concession. The next day, Zhou came to his place and told him to stay at the Yi Kai small hotel near Chenjia Wooden Bridge. The presented hat was indeed the one he was wearing at the time and abandoned after firing the shot, etc. When questioned, Zhou firmly maintained that Wang was the main culprit. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered both defendants to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>At around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a sudden large-scale brawl broke out in the Nanganjiaqiao area of Wusongbang between dozens of Jiangbei gang workers and Anhui gang workers, each wielding weapons. Yao Benyuan, the chief of the Wenzaobang Police Station, learned of this and immediately dispatched police to arrest them. Zhang Jialong (Anhui native), Peng Dazhi (Anhui native), Chu Dianwu (Shandong native), and the injured Zhang Rongfu (Anhui native, 27 years old), Wang Baocai (Jiangbei native, 30 years old), and others, as well as weapons such as iron shovels and crowbars, were arrested on the spot and taken to the station. The injured were taken by ambulance to the Wusong Health Bureau Hospital for treatment. Zhang Rongfu, who was injured, died in the hospital due to a fractured skull. Wang Baocai's injuries were not serious. Yesterday, the local guarantor Zhou Lansheng reported to the Shanghai District Court for an inquest. The deceased's elderly mother, Zhang Long, filed a request with the police station for relief. Police Chief Yao ordered the police to escort everyone to Shanghai for investigation.</p>

However, after persuasion from his friend Guo, he went to the Commoners' Sanatorium and requested a diagnosis from Director Yang. Within a month, the disease had been reduced by more than half, and recently he has completely recovered. Out of gratitude, Mr. Wang presented the hospital with a golden plaque inscribed with "Miraculous Hands Restore Spring." This is also a glimpse of the hospital's glory.</p>

<p>Chuan Ruoyu, an officer of the National Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), had traveled to Sichuan at the beginning of October to inspect the association's affairs and prepare for Dr. Eddy's lectures. His footprints covered the entire province. Yesterday, he finally finished his work and returned to Shanghai. According to his words to others, the Sichuan YMCA was founded in the early years of the Republic of China, starting from Chengdu and Chongqing and spreading to other places. The association's affairs are very developed. This time, Dr. Eddy's lectures in Sichuan were very popular with the people of the province, and the results were unprecedented. This has also helped the YMCA a lot. It is also said that Sichuan is a vast and resource-rich province, with wealth leading the country. Unfortunately, due to the warlord separatism and years of civil war, the people are suffering unspeakably. The naturally endowed area has become a hell, which is deeply regrettable. At present, the local army cannot resist the Red Bandits. If the central government does not provide assistance, the future is very dangerous.</p>

<p>Chapter 7: Veiling Tears, Selling Oneself into Misery; Paying Attention, Peeking at Invitations, Relying on Sincere Affection</p>
<p>Li Shilian saw cigarettes on the table, conveniently took one, and started smoking. At this moment, an unnatural smile spread across his face as he said to Jia Duocai: "Brother Duocai, we are good friends after all. When I am in absolutely impossible circumstances, you can't possibly not lend me a hand. I was originally thinking that finding a job in the South is always a case of too many monks and too little porridge, making it impossible to get a good position. Places like the Northwest, people don't come, so I took the risk and ran here.</p>
<p>I didn't expect that after arriving here, I realized everyone thinks the same way, and there are quite a few people waiting for vacancies here too. If I go back, I came with fanfare before, and I would feel like I would lose face. But if I want to find a job, I don't know when I can squeeze to the front, truly making it difficult to advance or retreat. Now is the period for developing the Northwest, and the Construction Department needs the most people. Since you know Director Gao, can you help me find a way out?" Jia Duocai said: "Your goal is very big! I'm afraid my position is not sufficient to recommend you, right?" Li Shilian held the cigarette, constantly flicking the ash, while his other hand patted his hair and stroked his chin, laughing: "I don't care about the title. Whatever it is, if I can work for a year or half a year, and resolve my current living situation, that would be enough. For example, let's talk about cars. Now the highway administration should have an Automobile Management Bureau." Jia Duocai said: "You want to be the director of the bureau?" Li Shilian laughed: "How could that be possible? If I can get a branch bureau under the director, that would be more than satisfactory!" Jia Duocai said: "Managing cars, naturally, involves things like transporting goods and passengers. Have you done that before?" Li Shilian shrugged his shoulders twice and laughed: "That doesn't mean only people who have done it before can do it. Who graduated from Jiaotong University and became the Minister of Railways? Who graduated from agricultural university and became the Minister of Industry? If officials and staff had to have done it and studied it before they could do it, there would be a talent crisis. I have been involved in taxation, in various capacities, for three or four years, and I have never studied any finance or economics." (101)</p>
<h3 id="e195">Trivial Football Talk <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— By Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Although the winter weather is cold, it doesn't cool down the hearts of football fans! As long as there's an exciting enough football match, the area around the field is still crowded and lively!</p>
<p>I think this is a good phenomenon. We dare not say the kind of "official" words like "promote sports" - actually, there's no need to say them - but compared to dance halls, dog racing tracks, and jai alai courts, although they are all entertainment, football's character is much more elegant!</p>
<p>The money and time I've spent on "watching football" add up to a considerable amount, so I've also earned the nickname "football fan."</p>
<p>During the prime of Lehua, one Saturday afternoon, I was denied leave to watch a game, so I secretly sneaked away to Shen Garden, preferring to enjoy the game to the fullest and face my superior's scolding when I returned, rather than dutifully and obediently be like an ant on a hot pot in the office!</p>
<p>Speaking of Lehua, it fills me with admiration mixed with endless sighs. Perhaps because of the saying, "The world's affairs, after a long period of unity, must divide!" Lehua broke up a long time ago! Luckily, Donghua took over, otherwise we football fans would have died of withdrawal.</p>
<p>In terms of "skill," Donghua is not necessarily inferior to Lehua; but Lehua was "tougher" than Donghua. The reason Lehua could not be called a "complete" team was because it never had enough qualified "wing" players. Donghua has "wings," but only has "skill" and lacks "toughness." Both are lacking!</p>
<p>The psychology of general football fans seems to be consistent "externally"! Most hope to win a few more games against foreigners. If Chinese players can make a few more "hurdles" and make foreigners trip and fall, it's worth clapping and laughing about. But "internally," there are many different factions! Some support Donghua, others support Youyou. Take the matches between Donghua and Youyou in the "Western League" this season, the situation among the spectators is much more tense than among the players competing on the field! I think shouting "good" to cheer on the players is acceptable; but when the players on both sides show signs of being overly aggressive, the spectators shout "fight!" as if they won't be happy unless they see a "wrestling match" in addition to the football game. Isn't that strange?</p>

<p>In the past, people's methods of suppressing talent were merely passive resistance; the so-called "high-brow songs find few singers" is one example.</p>
<p>The methods of suppressing talent used by people today are much harsher! Not only will they not sing along with your high-brow songs, but they will also destroy your melodies to their heart's content.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Warm Hall Evening Meal <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>In my hometown's customs, on the wedding night, after the bride and groom perform the ancestral worship ceremony, there is always a "warm hall evening meal."</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a humorous scene. When this humorous scene is about to unfold, it is usually some witty friends, squeezed into the bridal chamber already full of women and children, who tease the bride and groom without restraint, and strongly demand that the groom take the bride's hand and go to the main hall to eat the "warm hall evening meal." Thus, men and women, rustic and pretty, all crowd around the "beautiful couple" towards the main hall.</p>
<p>At this time, in the center of the main hall, two cedar tables have already been placed side by side. On these tables are eight exquisite dishes. After the "beautiful couple" sit down on the two large chairs facing south, the remaining seats are taken by some witty friends.</p>
<p>Thus, the "warm hall evening meal" begins.</p>
<p>First, the guest closest to the groom stands up to pour a cup of wine for the bride and groom, then uses chopsticks to offer this dish and that dish to the groom; but sometimes the groom often declines and does not "appreciate" the offer, so the person offering has to come up with a way to get the groom to eat it.</p>
<p>Gradually, it proceeds to the second person, the third person, ... until everyone sitting around has had their turn, and then the "warm hall evening meal" is over.</p>
<p>However, the time from beginning to end is often extended to three or four hours, because each guest sitting around has to come up with a method – something that will make the bride and groom feel shy and have enough to remember – and ask the bride and groom to do it this way; if not, they are willing to hold on for a long time, until it is done.</p>
<p>The above is a general sketch of the "warm hall evening meal," a custom in my hometown.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Records of Fleeting Fragrance from the Imperial Incense <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sometimes, perhaps these medicines happen to be somewhat effective against the patient's illness. Coupled with the patient's own psychological effect, it is easy to see results. After such occasional effectiveness a few times, people attribute most of the ineffectiveness to fate, believing that the great immortal is truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>Even the Empress Dowager, a female politician managing countless affairs every day, honestly has a very stubborn belief in this; but as for me, before I have obtained sufficient evidence, I really dare not believe it blindly.</p>
<p>"Let's just make a hypothetical assumption, Empress Dowager," I suddenly said, struck by a fit of foolishness, forgetting all my inhibitions: "Suppose that the immortal prescription has been obtained, and the medicine has been prepared, and given to"</p>
<p>"The patient has drunk it: but these medicines are really not suitable for the patient's illness, for example, using hot medicine for a heat disease, and cold medicine for a cold disease, wouldn't this be very dangerous for the patient? What if it causes a major disaster?"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager usually gets angry easily with others, but she treats me with special favor, never with harsh words or stern expressions, always especially tolerant; at this time, after hearing me raise such a strange (actually very reasonable) question, she couldn't help but become very angry.</p>
<p>"How dare you talk such nonsense!" Her face reddened, and she scolded me loudly.</p>
<p>I immediately regretted it too. Although my intention was right, how could I casually criticize the things that the Empress Dowager believed in? We should only blindly obey her like children obey their parents, without any doubts, and I dared to openly express my disagreement to her, which was obviously extremely audacious; if she was unhappy, she could impose any punishment on me. When I thought of this, I couldn't help but feel panicked. (211)</p>
<h3 id="e199">Old Goods Peddler <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>The old goods peddlers in Shanghai are like the drummers in Beiping, they both buy broken and old things. The only difference is that the drummers beat drums, while they shout out loud.</p>
<p>People who live in Shanghai cannot help but feel the expensiveness of rent. In order to save money, they have to live in extremely small houses. Those useless wastes, like newspapers and old bottles and cans, it feels wasteful to throw away, but there is no place to put them if they are kept. Old goods peddlers buy these kinds of things. Others don't want them, but they are willing to buy them, so they can buy these things at extremely low prices.</p>
<p>The origin of old goods peddlers is probably like this. But later, their business gradually expanded. Of course, some useless old things are bought by them. When in financial difficulties, carrying things to a pawnshop is not very elegant after all, and there are many things that pawnshops are unwilling to accept, so they are sold to old goods peddlers. Fortunately, when selling to them, others will not pay attention, and the old goods peddlers will try their best to deal with such business, not wanting to lose this good deal. If one person's financial resources are insufficient, they will unite several people to buy together.</p>
<p>Old goods peddlers have an association. After they buy things, they transform them themselves. They make old things into new ones, repair broken things, and then take these things to the association to sell. There, there are many regular customers, who specialize in buying old things.</p>
<p>I am a book addict, and I also wander around the old goods association in my spare time, getting one or two books that I need. But sometimes there are also very unexpected discoveries, like being able to buy many complete sets of magazines by accident.</p>
<p>Whether buying or selling, negotiating prices with old goods peddlers is an extremely troublesome matter. When buying, they will point out many shortcomings of that thing, making it a pretext for reducing the price. But when selling, they can point out many advantages, so they can raise the price. But they rarely have arrogant tempers, and within the possible range, a deal can always be made.</p>

<p>— Zhang Zhenlu</p>
<p>People often say, "Shanghai is paved with gold, just waiting for people to bend down and pick it up." People from rural towns and villages are transported to Shanghai in large numbers, seduced by this rumor, wanting to realize their golden dream; as a result, the streets are only filled with a few more vagrants, and the newspapers have a few more stories of kidnapping and trafficking! Although, in this city of endless wonders, there are indeed many people who have neither permanent property nor permanent employment, but can sit and eat in peace, living comfortably, like the people I want to describe. I admire them for having the richness of the rich, so I affectionately call them "Unemployed Rich People."</p>
<p>One year, my family moved to a certain neighborhood. Every night, I heard the sounds of mahjong games and radios from next door, which greatly interfered with my writing work, so I could only dare to be angry but not dare to speak. "Harmony is the most valuable, the way of the former kings," this is not me being good at reading broken sentences, it is really the legacy of the sages, too suitable for worldly affairs and human relationships! But look, the Sister Sun from next door, after talking to my wife a few times, gradually became acquainted; even I soon got to know the so-called Mr. Sun, and was even sometimes invited to join the mahjong game. So I had to endure the hidden pain and uphold the virtue of neighborly harmony. However, I learned about their family's living situation because of this, which can be considered compensation for the damage.</p>
<p>Their family rented two adjacent single-family shikumen houses, spent some renovation costs, and sublet the houses to others, so sixteen families lived in the two houses! This residential area has a very economical distribution method, which can be used for subletting to each household, now publicly announce that each house is divided as follows: the living room and patio, with a glass canopy built on the patio, is for one household, a small room is blocked off behind the living room for one household, a mezzanine is built on it, and steps are used to go in and out halfway, for one household, the front building for one household, the rear building for one household, the attic for one household, the kitchen room - commonly known as the pavilion room - for one household, and its roof was originally a drying platform, which is built into a wooden house for one household. The kitchen is shared. The head of the stairs and outside the upstairs window are used as a place for drying clothes. In total, there are sixteen households in the two houses. In addition to the front building of the living room that their family uses for themselves, they can earn a total of one hundred thirty to forty yuan in rent each month. The rent, house tax, and electricity bills that their family pays add up to less than ninety yuan, so they can sit back and earn forty to fifty yuan each month.</p>
<p>In addition to the husband and wife, there are two children and a maid, totaling five people; since there are few people, one front building is enough for living. Among the fifteen tenant households in these two houses, men and women are mixed, and of course many people have free time and want to find some entertainment and leisure methods, so the Sun family's radio has a very strong influence, attracting co-residents to come into the room to listen up close. Sister Sun is also very friendly, inviting everyone to play a game of mahjong, diligently providing cigarettes and leisure fruits, and only taking a small amount of head money in the game that does not hurt integrity, which is also very popular among the co-residents. Mr. Sun also has many friends, (which shows his hospitality and has the flavor of Lord Mengchang) often using playing cards to connect feelings, or containing other side effects, besides those who are specifically focused on gambling and losing money.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Sun has no occupation, he has a talent for socializing, and everyone who meets him once is attracted as a confidant. His ability to develop outwards, if used in business, should be able to get very satisfactory results! But he does not do business, so his body is not subject to any restrictions, and he is much more leisurely and comfortable than ordinary people, even up to the chairman of the National Government! When he encounters the side of the old calendar festival, he books a day show in a theater, borrows some nice name, and distributes and sells tickets separately; fortunately, he has many friends, and the sales of tickets always have considerable results. Every time he holds this trick called "da chou feng" (draw windfall) by the Shanghai people, he can earn as little as three or four hundred and as much as seven or eight hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun's filial piety is also praised by his friends. Every year, he always holds memorial ceremonies for his deceased parents, and sometimes even for his ancestors, on the anniversary of their death. He sends out invitations to invite people to eat a meal, how can people be embarrassed not to send a little gift? Thus, as a result of commemorating the ancestors, Mr. Sun's pocket can be filled with several hundred yuan again.</p>
<p>These few fixed incomes, within a year, already amount to four or five thousand yuan, his family's expenses naturally do not need to rely on the income of permanent employment, can be very sufficient, and the situation is also very generous. This Mr. Sun does not bother to emulate the "calculating" of those loafers (that deserves people's hatred), and takes this route to make money, in terms of personality, he is indeed much better than them.</p>

<p>▲ This Afternoon at 4 PM</p>
<p>In order to improve secondary education, the Jiangsu Education Department organized a committee to study various training issues. Since the implementation of the entrance examination system, the most important issue in secondary education is the heavy workload and intellectual burden that middle school students universally feel. They are busy all day long and do not have enough time. As a result, young people neglect their physical and mental cultivation, extracurricular activities, and independent research, which greatly affects educational efficiency and youth training. Director Zhou of the Education Department recognized this and organized a committee to study the issue of reducing student workload. He appointed Zhou Houchu, Principal of Provincial Yangzhou Middle School, Zheng Tonghe, Principal of Shanghai Middle School, Cao Chu, Principal of Zhenjiang Normal School, Zhang Haicheng, Principal of Nanjing Middle School, Tang Zhicai, Principal of Suzhou Agricultural School, and Peng Weiji, Principal of Changzhou Middle School, as seven committee members, and designated Zhou Houchu as the convener. After Zhou was appointed, he wrote to each committee member to ask them to convene teachers from each department at their respective schools to conduct preliminary research and scheduled a formal meeting in Shanghai this afternoon (28th) at 4 PM. Zhou has already arrived in Shanghai and said that this research will seek effective methods that are easy to implement and do not hinder the scope of departmental regulations. The department also instructed that the issue of tutor time and work allocation should be discussed together.</p>

The school's junior high school grades one, two, and three in the autumn, senior high school general subjects grades one, two, and three, and business subjects grades one and two all accept transfer students, and the entrance examination is scheduled for January 22nd.</p>

<p>2. Teacher Examination: Teacher examinations involve practical training, which usually lasts more than two years. The first year of training is limited to local education research groups. The main training items during this year include general individual observation and research, as well as participation in all educational activities in the school. In addition, there are speeches, application of foreign language conversation, handicrafts, natural science experiments, physical education, and journalism training. The second year of training is within the district education group. This year's training items include detailed understanding of the theory of each subject and systematic acquisition of teaching experience. In addition, attention must be paid to independent work and obedience to the guidance of consultants. The internship teaching time is stipulated to be eight hours per week. Internship teaching is not allowed in two schools at the same time. During internship teaching, special emphasis should be placed on independent and continuous work. The nature of this work is particularly noteworthy in the teacher examination committee.</p>
<p>Teacher examinations are conducted by a special examination committee. This special committee is composed of the chairman and vice-chairman, middle school teacher inspectors, and three well-known middle school instructors. There is at least one female member in this committee to handle the registration and examination procedures for female candidates. Whether the applicant is allowed to take the exam is determined by the chairman based on the certificate of the instructor in the middle school designated by the applicant for internship, the report of the applicant's consultant, and the criticism of the middle school inspector.</p>
<p>The method of teacher examination is the same as the degree examination, divided into written and oral examinations. The written examination is only one paper, and the topic is selected within the scope specified by the applicant's consultant. The oral examination includes demonstration teaching methods and educational inquiries.</p>
<p>Anyone can participate in the teacher examination. Those who fail the examination may be allowed to retake the exam with the permission of the special examination committee. The date is determined by the committee. The examination fee for the teacher examination is 40 marks. Those who pass the teacher examination can obtain a middle school teacher's certificate and be included in the register of candidates for permanent middle school teacher positions. Under the legal protection of national preparatory officials, they have the right to receive salaries. The annual salary for those who have been hired as middle school teachers is 3,000 to 4,000 marks. Other candidate middle school teachers who are on the register but have not been hired can also enjoy the national salary, but the amount is only 80% of the salary of a formal middle school teacher. Middle school teacher positions are appointed in turn according to the candidate register, except in special circumstances. In short, candidate middle school teachers must wait a long time to obtain a permanent middle school teacher position.</p>
<p>Although it is extremely difficult to obtain a German middle school teacher position, the number of men and women who eagerly seek this position is still large. Therefore, the special examination committee often raises the standards of examination and selection to limit the number of people. In Germany, where the population is surplus and lacks colonies, middle school teacher positions with permanent guarantees are often noticed by general university and vocational school students. According to the Prussian Ministry of Education's Popular Education Monthly published on August 20, 1930, the number of German university students preparing to take the national middle school teacher examination in 1929-1930 was 2,400 to 1,934. That is, this year, the number of candidates on the middle school teacher register has increased to 7,000 to 8,000, but only 1,600 can obtain permanent middle school teacher positions. This shows the strictness of Germany's selection of middle school teachers, which is unmatched by any country in the world. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e235">Melancholy Literature <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Saltikov-Shchedrin (saltikovshch)ekrin) said in a sketch called "One Day in My County":</p>
<p>"What to write? What heroic achievements to sing? There are no heroic achievements｜That place only has melancholy ordinariness, no heroes｜Their place is occupied by those who tremble in fear｜What should I do? Clearly, I can only grieve with you, and be a chronicler of sighs... But how difficult this is! ... The world is miserable, and I grieve with it, the world sighs｜I also sigh with it, and I also ask readers to grieve with me."</p>
<p>These few words reveal the greatest characteristic of old Russian literature. Under the gloomy conditions of Tsarist rule, the description of the wounds of Russian life became the main content of literary works. Whether it is Gogol's and Chekhov's satire and humor, or Turgenev's lyrical tone and Dostoevsky's meticulous psychological anatomy, they all carry a dark and melancholy shadow and a heavy feeling of sadness.</p>
<p>George Brandes said in an article commenting on Turgenev: "Turgenev's melancholy is essentially the melancholy of the Slavic race with its defects and tragic aspects, and is a legitimate descendant of Slavic folk songs. ... Gogol's melancholy comes from despair. When Dostoevsky expresses the same melancholy, it is because his heart sympathizes with those who have been trampled on and great sinners. Tolstoy's melancholy is based on his religious fate theory."</p>
<p>When we read these writers' works, we are often infected by their melancholy atmosphere. This melancholy is not the pleasant sentimentality of "cherishing spring and grieving autumn", but a kind of heavy mood of being overwhelmed by the surrounding chaos and darkness. The author sometimes treats you with a smile, but that kind of smile is not light, but a tragic smile. The so-called tearsthrdnghlaugbter is the characteristic of Gogol's and Chekhov's art.</p>
<p>In "How Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Nikiforovich Quarrelled," Gogol did his best to ridicule the ugliness of landlords and bureaucrats, making you unable to help but laugh no matter what. This story starts completely as a merry farce, but at the end it is also shrouded in an air of melancholy, and ends with the following characteristic sentence: "This world is very gloomy, gentlemen." Belinsky (belinsdy) said that Gogol's works "always reveal sad and depressed feelings", which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Chekhov's melancholy also once swept the Russian literary world. I don't know how many readers were infected with "Chekhov-style emotions". The disappointment and pessimism of the protagonist in his "Gloomy Story" towards himself, towards the gray reality of life, and towards those mediocre and humble people around him, is a reflection of "Chekhov-style emotions". His plays, such as the famous "The Cherry Orchard" and "Uncle Vanya", are all filled with gloomy, decadent, and negative emotions.</p>
<p>Although Russian writers were suffocated by the darkness and ugliness of the surrounding world, and melancholy spasms arose on their faces, the yearning and pursuit for a bright future, like an unquenchable fire, always burned in their hearts. This is the greatest part of Russian literature. Even in Chekhov's gloomy works, one can see the longing for the dawn of a brilliant future life. Vershinin in "Three Sisters" said the following: "In two or three hundred years, human life will probably become dazzlingly beautiful and brilliant."</p>
<p>But in less than twenty or thirty years, more than ten times faster than Chekhov expected, the "beautiful and brilliant" life that Chekhov dreamed of has been realized on earth. What is reflected in today's Russian literature is naturally no longer "melancholy ordinariness", but truly "heroes" and "great achievements".</p>
<h3 id="e236">Kunming (Part 1) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>｜Local Impression Notes｜</p>
<p>People who have never been to Yunnan always feel a little scared when they mention Yunnan: as if the place is very far away, barbaric, and has poisonous miasma. No one has ever dared to go, and if you go, you will die! Therefore, even the old men of Xinfeng who were conscripted into the army, upon hearing that the team was going to Yunnan, would rather pick up a stone and break their arms than follow the team to their deaths!</p>
<p>This kind of fear and prejudice against Yunnan has always been very serious. In fact, why is Yunnan like what they imagine? ｜</p>
<p>Yunnan has its own special flavor. In this vast realm of towering mountains and primitive nature, although some appear wild and rugged, there are many places of "green mountains and clear waters" that you cannot imagine.</p>
<p>For example, Kunming? What kind of place do you think it is?</p>
<p>It is a beauty hiding in the deep mountains, not yet discovered by people. Although the dress is a bit outdated, it is enough to intoxicate you.</p>
<p>When a traveler, carrying such a tired body, is brought to Kunming alone by the Yunnan-Vietnam train, it will give you sweet tenderness, as if it were your long-lost mistress. According to your likes, it will satisfy you in every way.</p>
<p>If you are a worshiper of cities, when you arrive in Kunming, you will not feel that it does not have any urban atmosphere! In 遒裏 there are neat Western-style shops, wide and flat roads, cars, rickshaws, bicycles, constantly coming and going; people rushing to join the excitement, walking so crowded on both sides of the street. The shops on both sides of the road display dazzling goods, and the clear sound of the gramophone is constantly broadcast from the shops with cheap signs, which seems so strangely lively.</p>
<p>From day to night, the place that is always crowded with people is the playground without sorrow. There is a sound movie theater and a silent movie theater, and the theater also has a Peking opera singer and a Yunnan opera singer. In addition, there are many small tea gardens where you can listen to the board-banging opera, where you can just make a pot of tea and sit and listen.</p>
<p>Luxurious taverns and elegant coffee shops are also available in this place. Unfortunately, there are no female attendants, otherwise, it would be enough for the general playboys to be happy.</p>
<p>Kunming also has a road like Shanghai's Avenue Joffre. This quiet place is full of foreign residences and hotels, located next to the Panlong River. In the evening, you can walk slowly on the river bank, look at the slowly flowing river water, and the electric lights in the opposite room with their attractive magic power shining brightly on the water, which is really interesting!</p>
<p>If you think this is too monotonous and does not fit your ideal of loving scenery, then you might as well go to Cuihu Lake for a walk? That place is located on the northwest side of Kunming City. Wuhua Mountain, Yuantong Mountain, and Gongyuan Slope stand out around it. A clear small river surrounds the lake, and there are two long embankments full of green willows in the lake. Because these two embankments intersect each other, the entire lake is divided into four parts. At the intersection point, there is the famous Haixin Pavilion. No matter what day it is, you can see many men and women leaning on the railings, leisurely throwing fried rice candy, and admiring the fish swimming in the pool.</p>
<p>If you have been in Kunming for a long time and feel that strolling the streets during the day is a bit tasteless, then you might as well go out at night. Kunming at night has some special flavors. It is best to go to the antique stalls on Wenming Street: it is very lively there at night. All kinds of things are sold there. Anything you can't buy on the street during the day can be bought there at night. However, please pay attention: there are often many "slickers" holding something and pretending to sell it to the antique dealers. The antique dealers also deliberately give him (or her) a high price, but the seller is still a bit unwilling, and the two sides are struggling there. At this time, if you do not understand the trick, and think that the antique dealers are willing to give him (or her) such a price, then the thing must be very valuable, and you rashly add a few more cents, then you will definitely be fooled.</p>
<p>Kunming people have so many treacherous skills, but this is where they suffer a great loss. They only care about the present and not the future. They think that as long as they can deceive others, that's enough.</p>
<p>Due to the influence of the living environment, the nature of Kunming people is mostly very weak. Needless to say, women, many men do not even dare to go out, and just die guarding their homes all their lives. They love vanity, love to put on a show, and no matter who it is, women must be called "Madam", and men must be called "Master". They don't care whether they have food to eat or not, but face is something that cannot be neglected. Even when they reach the point where they rely on their daughters selling prostitution to make a living, their facade is still dressed up very beautifully.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Returning from the Volcano (7) <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>After they left, I still stayed alone at the edge of the crater, mourning those young men from foreign countries whose names are unknown, those brave warriors who sacrificed for love!</p>
<p>The smoke coming out of the crater, at first, rose up like the black smoke spewed out by a train engine when it first starts ... puff ... puff ... Then, slowly rising dense black smoke turned into wisps of gray clouds. Finally, the gray clouds slowly faded away.</p>
<p>The circumference of the crater is more than 30 feet, but no one knows the depth. Last year, the volcanic expedition organized by the Yomiuri Shimbun only reached halfway, because there was no air, and the volcano was about to explode, so they could not move forward. They had seen many young men and women who were crushed to pieces. Although I could not see that tragic death, looking at the crater with blood stains, I knew that it had devoured many promising young men and women.</p>
<p>Perhaps everyone has what is called conscience? Even a person whose rationality is like iron, usually opposes love suicide and opposes suicide! Cursing them as weak, worthless! But once you come to the volcano, everyone will turn curses into pity, and dislike into love. Everyone has such a thought: "People who come here to commit suicide are really brave and great."</p>
<p>Originally, people who commit suicide do so because there is no way out of life, or they feel tired of life. After being heartbroken or unemployed, they can no longer endure the pain, so they make up their minds to end their lives in a very short time and gain permanent relief. But people who come to the volcano to commit suicide are different! They must go through the crowded life of a night of sailing, go through more than forty miles of mountain paths, the labor of trekking, traverse the vast desert, and traverse the steep and terrible lava, and then offer their lives to the volcano as a sacrifice, flesh and blood flying everywhere, and their bodies are incomplete. Why don't they take poison or jump into the sea? It's a bit too silly to suffer so much hardship and pain before death, isn't it?</p>
<p>The guards at the crater told us: "Most people who jump into the volcano do so in the evening at dusk, and it is rare in the morning." He also said: "I haven't seen anyone jump into the volcano today." This means that someone had jumped down a few days ago.</p>
<p>At the highest point of the crater, there is a round reflector, from which you can see the infinitely deep mountain and the monument to the Yomiuri Shimbun's exploration, which is also near this mirror.</p>
<h3 id="e238">New Star <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Prism</p>
<p>We often see the term "new star," in writings about newly popular actors, in movie advertisements, and on radio programs. However, these are merely rhetorical metaphors; we rarely hear about true new stars. In the heavens, perhaps a new star is discovered only once every few decades. Nature is always so dull and unchanging, unlike man-made "new stars," which can be created at will. Naturally, these celestial new stars cannot be as frequently in the public eye as their human counterparts; but precisely because they are so rare, they should be far more precious than the overused term "new star."</p>
<p>The term "new star" is also called "temporary star," and in Chinese, it's known as "guest star." Among these three names, "temporary star" seems the most appropriate. "Guest star" implies that the star comes from one place and goes to another, which is not in accordance with the facts. "New star" suggests a sudden birth and a permanent addition to the sky, but in reality, all new stars exist long before they are discovered, and they eventually fade away. A new star cannot shine forever, so using "new star" to describe a person actually carries a somewhat ominous connotation. "Temporary star" describes a sudden brightening, from being invisible to the naked eye to becoming visible, and then disappearing again. It appears temporary to us, but as for the star's existence, we cannot easily trace its origins. Therefore, even this is not a scientific term. In modern astronomy, according to Pickering's classification, it belongs to the first class of variable stars.</p>
<p>The importance of variable stars in modern astronomy is almost unparalleled. Cepheid variable stars are used to determine the distance of fixed star clusters and nebulae; eclipsing binary stars can determine the orbits of binary stars; and long-period variable stars indicate how stars evolve. New stars are particularly good sources of reference. Mira, a variable star, is most helpful in understanding new stars. At its brightest, it is a fairly bright second-magnitude star; at its dimmest, it reaches tenth magnitude. Our naked eye can barely see stars of the sixth magnitude, so this star appears and disappears to us. However, it recurs approximately every 330 days, so we can be confident that it will not disappear completely.</p>
<p>New stars are a more extreme example. At their brightest, they can reach the luminosity of Venus; at their dimmest, they may reach the twenty-first magnitude (the limit of what telescopes can see) or even complete darkness. Whether they have a cycle, humans with their short lifespan and history cannot yet answer. However, some old new stars have disappeared and are now seen as faint stars in their original positions. Astronomers probably visit them from time to time, and perhaps one day they will find them brightening again, resolving a question for us.</p>
<p>The common explanation is that the sudden brightening of a new star is due to external forces causing it to explode (as the Reuters report on the new star on the 25th said). The fate after the explosion is death. This can also lead to our reveries. After it becomes lightless and powerless, it may be drawn in by the force that caused it to explode and gradually become a planet, and eventually, life may arise on it. We will never know all this, as the time scale is too long.</p>
<p>The telegraph report states that the newly discovered star is 1,500 light-years away and that its brightening occurred around the time of the fall of the Roman Empire. This already indicates a vast amount of time, but even after another 1,500 years, it will not have died out. The figure of 1,500 light-years seems questionable, as it seems impossible to determine the distance of a single star to be more than a thousand light-years.</p>
<p>According to the report, this new star is located in the Hercules constellation, which is probably what is now translated as the Hercules constellation. At our latitude, this constellation sinks below the northwest horizon by 6 PM in December and rises from the northeast at 6 AM. If it weren't for the continuous cloudy weather these days, we might have had a chance to see it. Otherwise, the Hercules constellation originally has no bright stars, and the sudden appearance of a bright star would be noticeable to anyone familiar with the stars. Wasn't it discovered by an amateur astronomer in England? Why didn't the observatory discover it first? That's because astronomers mainly use telescopes to search the distant sky, only seeing a very small corner of it, so they have fewer opportunities to pay attention to the entire sky than amateurs. If there were a telescopic new star in the sky today and we didn't know where it was, we might search for it with a telescope for years without finding it.</p>

<p>— By Pianndlle, Translated by Xi Dichen</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the bottom of the village, they walked extra fast, gasping for breath - Crawl, crawl up here! - They crawled up the chalky, rugged shore - now they even used their hands - grabbing tightly as they climbed - because the hobnailed boots they were wearing - oh God! - were slippery.</p>
<p>Their faces flushed crimson, they crawled to the shore, and the women gathered noisily around the village spring turned their heads to look. Weren't those the two Totolisi brothers? Yes, it was them - Salo and Nelli. Ah, poor souls! Why were they running like that! The brother Nelli, because he was already exhausted, stopped for a moment, wanting to catch his breath and answer the women, but Salo pulled him away.</p>
<p>"Our cousin Cheru!" Nelli then turned his head and said: He raised his hand, seemingly to give three blessings. The women let out cries of sympathy and terror. One of them asked loudly:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Nameless: God!" Nelli shouted from afar.</p>
<p>The brothers crossed the small square and headed towards the doctor's house.</p>
<p>× × × × × × × × ×</p>
<p>Dr. Xituoluo, wearing a shirt, his face unshaven for at least ten days, his eyes swollen, shuffled around the room in a pair of old slippers, holding a pitiful-looking sick child in his arms, with a sallow complexion and skin and bones, about nine years old.</p>
<p>His wife had been in bed for eleven months; besides the eldest child he was holding, there were six other children in the house, all dressed in rags, dirty and boisterous; the whole house was upside down, in chaos - it was a ruin; leftover food, fruit peels, and garbage were all piled on the floor; the chairs and stools were broken, the armchairs had no cushions, and the beds hadn't been made in who knows how long, the sheets torn into strips, because the children often had pillow fights on the beds for fun - these poor things!</p>
<p>Only in the room that had once been the reception room, a large photograph hanging on the wall remained intact; it was a photo of the doctor himself, taken in his youth, when he had just obtained his degree: dressed neatly, radiating a smile.</p>

<p>Due to the bank holiday suspension of trading for two days, the gold market fell upon reopening yesterday. Reports indicate that Chairman Chiang himself has strongly denied the rumors, shattering hopes for favorable news. The Chinese Commercial Bank vigorously offered drafts, leading to a generally weak market sentiment throughout the day. In the morning, overseas silver markets during the holiday period and the silver price in the Montevideo forward market rose slightly, but exchange rates shrank slightly, spot gold in London fell by half a penny, the Central Bank's official exchange rate for both British and American currencies remained unchanged, the customs gold unit shrank slightly by one li, the standard price for gold bars was 1,012.9 yuan, and the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. As a result, off-market trading opened, initially quoted at 81.2 yuan. However, due to reports that Chairman Chiang firmly denied any inflationary policies, public confidence was greatly restored, dispelling rumors unfavorable to sellers. The trend toward selling became a torrent, immediately breaking the 80 yuan barrier. Large holders wanted to dump their holdings, but lacked counterparties, causing the decline to be quite severe, gradually falling to 71.2 yuan, before slightly stabilizing. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, and all holders became more cautious. Large holders took the opportunity to buy at the low, causing a rebound. However, the opening in the morning was still low, and although public confidence had not yet stabilized, the selling trend continued. However, because the exchange market was loose but normal, and banks still had an appetite, activity in the buying market caused a rebound. Shortly thereafter, it was learned that the HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with the pound rising 0.125 and the dollar rising 0.25, causing public apprehension and another downturn. However, because the Central Bank and HSBC were still purchasing foreign exchange, the market stabilized after the decline. Shortly thereafter, the silver equalization tax was announced, reduced by 0.25, with only 5.5% being collected. With the pound exchange rate calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.375, the upward trend was hindered. Thereafter, the exchange market slightly hardened, and traffic, Zhejiang, and Shanghai poured out their holdings quite forcefully. Sellers seized the opportunity to exert their power, and many large holders slightly released their holdings, once breaking the 70 yuan barrier. Banks took the opportunity to purchase at the low, and the domestic market remained mediocre. Seeing the low, buying activity allowed for a rebound. A speculator named Luo came to sell drafts again. Thereafter, although there was a setback, the domestic market had stabilized, and public confidence gradually became more stable. Supply was greater than demand, and the potential for improvement in the afternoon was good. Although the market was stable upon reopening in the afternoon, it was unexpected that public confidence still harbored a downward trend, and banks' appetites waned again. Although the initial report of Indian silver was up six annas, and there was some struggle, the 70 yuan barrier was finally breached again. The exchange market also hardened accordingly, and there was still a downturn. Later, due to some buying to cover short positions at the low, it was able to be maintained. Banks took the opportunity to purchase at the low, and silver companies also came to buy in. Gradually, it rebounded, and the second report of Indian silver was down two annas. At this time, the situation hovered. Finally, large holders bought in one after another, and the supply in the market lacked momentum, gradually rising to over 70 yuan. The market closed relatively stable. It was found that the market situation for the day was difficult to rise but easy to fall, with the buying side showing fatigue. The Chinese Commercial Bank vigorously offered drafts, with rumors of negative news, which may have contributed to this. The day's market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 973.5 yuan, a decrease of 9.4 yuan compared to before the holiday. Fuxing, Yongheng, and Yujin bought drafts, rising to 5.8 yuan. Dakang, Yuanmao, and Yong sold, causing great apprehension. In a fleeting moment, it retreated to 4 yuan. However, because Huabi had purchased U.S. dollars for January at 0.9375, and banks had a buying appetite, Fuxing, Yongheng, Xingchunyuan, and Yongshang bought in, rising to 6.8 yuan. Hengyu and others took the opportunity to sell at the high, retreating to 5.7 yuan. However, because banks were still buying drafts for March at 0.1875, Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, Fuyu, Yuqing, and Yongchang sold drafts. Because China and HSBC were still purchasing foreign exchange, it rose to 7.3 yuan. Unexpectedly, the selling momentum had not been exhausted, and public confidence was still downward. Fuxingyong took the opportunity to sell at the high. Learning that HSBC's official exchange rate was up 0.125 for the pound and 0.25 for the dollar, it went down again. However, because the Central Bank and HSBC had some purchases, the situation was mostly stable in the middle. Dadesheng, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Dafa, Yongfuxingyong, etc., sold drafts, causing the buying side to be overwhelmed, gradually falling to 2 yuan. Hengxing, Juchang, Fuxing, Yonghengyong, Changyongyong, etc., bravely bought at the low. The Central Bank purchased U.S. dollars for February at 0.0625, causing a rebound to 4.5 yuan. Senchangyong and Tianfeng sold, and then it declined again after the high. The silver equalization tax was announced, reduced by 0.25, with a tax of 5.5% being levied. Public confidence remained fatigued. After entering, Senchangyong, Fuxingyong, Yicheng, Dachangxiang, Zhengchang, etc., sold in succession. The exchange market hardened slightly, breaking the 70 yuan barrier, retreating to 69.5 yuan. Hengyu, Chunyuan, Yongbing, Xingchang, Dazhaofeng, Changshunmao, etc., jointly bought in, making it difficult to settle drafts for March at 0.25, and rebounding to 73 yuan. Fuxingyongchang, Dada, Hengyu, Dadesheng, Futaiheng, Tongchun, etc., suddenly came to supply. The speculator Luo sold drafts, and it fell again to 0.02 yuan. Hengyu bought aggressively at the low, allowing it to be maintained. Tongtaichang, Changshengyong, Dadesheng, etc., also bought in. Then, it rebounded again to 2.6 yuan. Thereafter, public confidence had stabilized. Although Luo and Bingxing tried hard to sell in the market, the buying side was still enthusiastic. After struggling, the afternoon closed at 992.5 yuan. The market turned slightly stable upon closing.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 971.9 yuan. Although Shanghai was buying U.S. dollars for February at 0.075, and Korean Huabi was offering drafts for March at 0.25, it still gradually declined from 2.3 yuan. Tongfu, Tianfeng, Yongyuqingyong, Yuanyi, Yuanfeng, Senjingyong, Yuanmao Yong and others sold drafts, and retreated to 69 yuan. Although Qianchangxiang, Dafengheng, entered at 9.8 yuan, and Bombay reported a rise of 6.6 annas, there was no impact. At this time, due to Fuxingyong, Yuanmao Yong, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Dadesheng, Dingchang, etc., selling drafts, it gradually fell to 7.7 yuan. Mitsui purchased U.S. dollars for February at 0.0875, Yuanmao, Yongwanchangyong, Yifengyong tried to buy drafts, once rising to 9.7 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongfuyu, Yanmao, Dadesheng came to sell again, and the heart declined, returning to 7.3 yuan. The bank's appetite still bought, Tongfu Fuxing Yong Qingyu, Zhaofengchang Hengyu Tongtaichang and other continued to enter at 9.1 yuan, Yuqingyong opened to supply drafts, and retreated to 8 yuan. At this time, because the silver company bought back U.S. dollars for January at 0.0125, the people's hearts had settled, and Hengyu also came to maintain, and bought back a small 0.2, 0.3, 0.2 annas, and rose to 9.3 yuan, and Tongyi, etc., slightly sold, and retreated to 7.7 yuan. Under the lines of Hengyu Zhengchang Qianchangxiang Yuankangxiang Fuxing Yongzhentai, the counter was suddenly dry, and it rebounded to 71.5 yuan, and Dafayong Tongfu took the opportunity to sell, and fell to 0.05 yuan. The closing price was 970.8 yuan. After the market closed, under the supply of Tongfu Hengyu Shunli, etc., it retreated to within 70 yuan. It was found that the highest price of the day was 977.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 967.3 yuan, with a difference of 10 yuan. As a result, it fell by 12.1 yuan compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>The closing price was 101.9 yuan, as indicated by the Central Bank's gold standard price, which was about 42 yuan lower than the closing price, which was less than 12 yuan more than before the holiday. The January registration was 957 yuan, February was 973 yuan, the morning margin was 952 yuan, the afternoon margin was 950 yuan, and the gold price was 963.5 yuan, about 10 yuan lower than the standard price for the period. The spot market was stable, and the buying price of Tianjin goods was reduced by 7 yuan. There were no transactions. It was heard that local goods had been made with a reduction of 7.75 yuan, and Yifengheng Naji entered more than 700 taels. It was difficult for Shenkang to offer 13 yuan for currency swaps, and there were few transactions. There were 6,155 drafts remaining for January, with a total of 36 bulls and 15 bears.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In summary, Hengchangyong, Hengyu Yuankangxiang, Shunmao Tongchun Yingxiang Dingkang Fuyu Tongyi Hanhheng Qianchangxiang etc. were on the buying side. Senchangyong Dachangxiang Fuxingyong Jiarun Zhengchang Dingchang Tianfeng Yongfeng Juchang Bingxing Wanxing etc. were on the selling side. Changda Fuxingyong Yuanmao Yongheng Xing advanced first, then retreated, Tongtaichang Qianchangxiang Zhaofengchang advanced first, then retreated. Dalian Gang Wanxing did less than 1,000, and 400 drafts were squeezed out. Shunli did a total of 500, and more than 100 were squeezed in. The Guangdong gang was relatively calm, and Hengxing was also small, and the adjustment was slightly advanced. The total number of transactions on the day was 37,184 in the morning, 23,408 in the afternoon, and 25,347 February futures, with a total of 64 bulls and 53 bears.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Chinese Banks Vigorously Offer Drafts, Foreign Exchange Trends Loosen <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was stimulated by overseas telegrams that trading had been compressed for two days. London large bills were up 0.0625 for both near and far terms, U.S. dollars were up 0.125, the Montevideo forward silver price was up one li, London spot gold was down half a penny, the pound against the dollar was down 0.375, the dollar against the pound was down 0.375, the pound against the franc was unchanged, and the dollar against the franc was up 0.375. Therefore, the opening price for recent sales was 1 shilling 4 pence 0.625 for the pound and 34.25 yuan for the U.S. dollar. Compared to before the holiday, both the British and American exchange rates were unchanged. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both the British and American currencies remaining unchanged, and the customs gold unit also remaining unchanged. However, after reports that Chairman Chiang had announced that he would never inflate the currency, the Chinese merchants were psychologically weak and lacked buyers. At this time, the drafts were looser by 0.0625, and the U.S. dollar was harder by 0.125. Banks seized the opportunity to purchase at the low, and the situation was relatively stable. It was learned in advance that HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with the pound rising 0.125 and the dollar rising 0.25. People's hearts were still timid. The Japan Bank and others worked hard to issue them, but because the Central Bank and HSBC still had some issues, they were still able to maintain them. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.25, with 5.5% being levied. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 0.375. Thereafter, it was loose for a while. Zhejiang, traffic, Shanghai, etc., tried to jam the order, but there were still many buyers to purchase at the cheap, and the potential for stabilization gradually turned. The afternoon market first stabilized and then loosened. The bank continued to jam, and the Indian silver also increased by six annas, but it hardened. The Chinese businessman shoveled and then jammed, and the bank bought it at a cheap price. The silver company also made up for the US exchange, and the Indian silver returned to two annas again, and the process was loosened and then smoothed out. With closing price of the recent sales, the British exchange rate was 1 shilling 4 pence 0.78125 and the U.S. dollar was 34.5625 yuan, compared to before the close. It is estimated that the British hardened 1.5625 yuan and the U.S. Hardened 3.125 yuan, and the Chinese businessmen did not agree with the shovel, and about 200,000 yuan of US dollars were crushed and a few orders were purchased. Although the China Central HSBC had peeled out, traffic, Shanghai, and Zhejiang poured out a lot. The day's transaction record is recorded below.</p>
<p>The recent sales price of the British exchange in the morning was 1 shilling 4 pence 0.625. Zhengjin sold January 0.4375 to Citibank. Mitsui sold March 0.1875 to HSBC.

<p>Since the closing of foreign firms some days ago, the market for silver dollars has gradually loosened due to the limited flow of funds. Yesterday, all foreign firms resumed operations, and as the end of the year approaches, competition among banks is inevitable, resulting in a tense situation. The interbank lending rate for foreign currency was 0.4 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The initial rate for overnight overdrafts was 0.45 yuan, which later changed to 0.52 yuan, an increase of more than 0.2 yuan from the previous day. The transaction volume for interbank lending was over 2.8 million in the morning and over 300,000 for new credit. The transaction volume in the afternoon market was 1.2 million, and the transaction volume in the Xiaozonghui market was over 800,000. The amount of foreign currency collateral redeemed was over 600,000, and the amount newly issued was over 900,000. For bank settlements, foreign firms settled over 4.6 million in bills, over 4.9 million in various goods and foreign currency collateral, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 800,000 in short-term collateral, over 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 900,000 in special exchange, over 3.5 million in year-end settlements, and 800,000 in warehouse receipts.

<p>Yesterday's Opening Session Saw the Strongest Gains</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange still only traded January futures for one month. Trading was slightly more active, and the market was relatively firm. Although the overnight loan rate rose to forty cents again, most expected it to be temporary due to settlement reasons and unlikely to rise further. The issue of silver repatriation gradually became a possibility. Furthermore, due to the settlement and New Year holiday, shorts made some covering purchases. With only one trading day left in the year, it is expected that there will not be much fluctuation. Yesterday, the opening session saw strong gains, especially the purchase of twenty rolls of No. 53, which pushed the price to $51.05, an increase of 65 cents from the previous day and the highest price in nearly two weeks. Other varieties also saw gains of 356 cents. In the second session, retail investors sold off slightly. Only the Remnant Troops Reorganization and the 1929 Customs Duty bonds were slightly better by 5 to 10 cents, while the rest fell by 5 to 30 cents. In the two afternoon sessions, trading had already cleared. The opening session was slightly mixed, with fluctuations of only about 5 to 10 cents. The closing was stable with no significant gains or losses. Today is the settlement day for December futures, with no market. Starting tomorrow, February futures will be added for auction, which should be more active. Yesterday's market results showed that, except for the 1923 Customs Duty bonds, which were slightly lower by 25 cents, the rest were slightly better by 5 to 40 cents. The total transaction volume was $6.7 million. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: dollar, transaction unit: hundred yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Yang Hong, yesterday (the 26th), the New York stock market was slightly tired and mixed. Trading was specialized, with activity concentrated in public utility stocks. The Dow Jones Utility Average is now less than one pound away from its historical low. Independent steel stocks were active and slightly higher. Although Iron Age magazine estimated an increase in steel work, major steel stocks remained quiet. Automobile stocks were firm due to increased automobile production. Other stocks were sluggish due to the upcoming opening of Congress. The bond market was mixed and the market was quiet. Small exchange stocks weakened. The total volume for the day was 1,050,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>| Inflationary Air Dissipates |</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the situation is weakening again. Because newspapers recorded the Ministry of Finance's instructions, the Shanghai silver and money industry should not lightly believe rumors, saying that the theory of inflation will never be adopted, causing morale to be slightly frustrated. However, Tung Seng and Tung Chi cotton merchants absorbed a large amount of quota and firmly refused to release it, so the market was not very weak. In the afternoon, spot sales picked up, and Sichuan brokers purchased quite actively, and morale rose slightly. However, although gold prices fell, the market failed to rise.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the marked yarn market, due to reports that the government had no intention of inflating the currency, most discussions before the opening said that the market price might fall when the auction opened. However, new sellers in the market were not very enthusiastic, and all months fell by 50 cents. However, by the second and third sessions, the bulls of the major players remained unmoved, and the market price rebounded by 12 cents, and the closing price remained flat. After the opening in the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price broke the 70 yuan mark, and morale was frustrated. However, spot yarn sales were active, with more than 1,700 bales, but the market price failed to rise. As a result, all months fell by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 50 cents. It was found that Jifeng sold 400 bales, Jinchang 300 bales, Taixing 500 bales, Dafeng 850 bales, Gengfeng 950 bales, Ruida 300 bales, Hengde 650 bales, Taichang 400 bales, and Xincheng 850 bales.

<p>The cotton market is falling, and the market climate is relatively soft. Due to Chiang Kai-shek's talk, the government decided not to adopt a non-convertible paper currency policy, and the gold market turned down. The balance tax was reduced by 25 cents, buyers in the market decreased, and the market shrank and weakened. However, the major players' multi-million dollar holdings remained unmoved. However, there was also news of a fall in Indian cotton.</p>

<p>Before the opening of the marked cotton market, most people expected it to rise on the previous day due to American cotton. Unexpectedly, the telegram still fell by 5 pounds. Indian cotton stopped trading. Newspaper news was beneficial to short sellers. Buyers in the market were at a loss. All months fell by 5 cents to 15 cents to 20 cents. However, the major players' bulls still did not let go. After the opening in the afternoon, the market situation became weaker. Because the gold price fell again, breaking the 70 yuan mark, the selling trend was slightly stronger. As a result, all months fell by 10 cents, 15 cents, and 30 cents. It was found that Suilong sold 1,000 dan, Gengfeng 1,000 dan, Shenji 1,300 dan, Xinheng 2,800 dan, Tongji 2,000 dan, Dafeng 2,500 dan, Shenchang 1,200 dan, Tongfeng 1,000 dan, and Xincheng 1,900 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened. Due to the holiday, the market was flat and tired. All months fell by 2 to 4 points. The January bulls closed out due to the delivery notice reaching 17,200 bales. A considerable amount of cotton was also sold in July. Although the market price is currently firm, demand cannot keep up, so the market is still hovering. Spot cotton inquiries are better and textile conditions have also improved. The closing was stable. Spot goods fell by 5 points and futures fell by 3 to 9 points. British and Indian cotton stopped trading. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 26th):</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for White Ross Cotton on the 27th was 233.5 rupees, a decrease of 2.5 rupees from the previous day's closing.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for December flour futures. The delivery volume has decreased. Because new warehouse receipts were no longer delivered by manufacturers, old warehouse receipts were extracted by the buyer gangs. Also, some manufacturers took them back themselves. As a result, the actual chips were reduced, and the market became tight. As the end of this month approached, there was a squeeze situation. Therefore, judging from the trend, if spot sales are good when the market opens next year, it should continue to be firm. The total delivery volume was estimated to be 23,000 bags of Green Turret recovered by Xinda. Only 3,000 to 5,000 bags were taken by the buyer gangs, and the rest were local hoarders.</p>

<p>| Delivery Volume is About 30 Carloads |</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month was generally quiet. The quoted price for foreign wheat was up 16.5 cents in Chicago, and there was no market in Canada. When the price opened, as the end was approaching, people inside and outside the industry were less motivated. As there were few transactions, the price was not very good. By the afternoon opening, a part of the floating bulls in this month spat out, and morale weakened. As for the delivery volume, it was heard that there were about 30 carloads, mostly taken by manufacturers. Distant months were slightly softer due to the recent situation. As a result, this month fell by 30 cents, and January to March each fell by a small amount. Spot wheat was closed because the factory stomach did not move.</p>
<p>Flour demand in Chicago has improved somewhat, but spot purchases are very light, and bulls continue to close out when prices rise.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was scarce again due to rain, with only about 20 units (goods totaling nearly 4,000 piculs). The sales market was also limited because of this. However, the situation continued to be tight, and the overall situation was still not very good. Apart from silver shortages and other factors, as a result, there were very few transactions for each product. As for the market, the late rice was boosted because the Qingdao gang handled 400 to 500 bags, while the thick japonica only increased by a dime or so. And the early rice in the South Port was only slightly higher by a few cents. As for Du Yangjian, the supply and sales were balanced, and the situation was settled. Yin Yuan also had no gains or losses, only Bian Yuan did not have a wide outlet and was short a small amount.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources from various routes in Hexia. In terms of sales, white japonica was slightly moved by the bag. Sales were still good. White Yuan and Yin Yuan were normal. Each early thin rice tip also had good sales. The market shape was that the price of white japonica was settled. White Yuan and Yin Yuan were weak, and the rest of the goods were in a fixed trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the purchase and sale of foreign rice by local customers was strong. Because the arrival and inventory of Ke-hsien rice have been low recently, most people tended to use foreign rice. Although there was a large base inventory of foreign rice, the arrival rate has not been high recently. In addition, the relationship between cost and production price meant that the owners were very determined. Yesterday, in addition to the inland purchases from this street, the Ningbo gang also inquired about foreign broken rice, and the market became more active, and the price immediately rose by four or five cents. Statistics showed that 2,000 bags of Siamese broken rice and 3,000 bags of Saigon rice were opened. In addition, Annam japonica and foreign Yuan rice totaled 200 to 300 bags. Yang rice futures were initially very strong. The open return of Saigon March was as high as $5.07, but Yali sold 1,000 tons of April and 500 tons of March, and the market immediately returned to flat. Ke-hsien opened a job to sell 2,800 bags of Hunan Shashi rice, which was diverted by the local agent from the mainland.

<p>| Exemption from Anhui's Five-Sheng Donation is Clearly Stated |</p>
<p>Yesterday, for foreign firm sesame in the market, Jardine Matheson inquired about the price, opening at $9.20, and traded 500 tons. Compared to the previous session's price, it increased by 15 cents. All of it was mental business, wanting to bet on a profitable market next year. Also, recently, oil workshops in Zheshao have been hoarding and purchasing goods, so the market trend has become firm. A total of more than 700 bags of spot goods were opened in the market. The market price was slightly tight. Yesterday afternoon, the Miscellaneous Grain Association announced in a reply to the Ministry of Finance that the Anhui five-sheng relief donation would be supervised and exempted for soybeans, sesame oil, miscellaneous grains, and other donations within December. Therefore, people in the market may see a change in the future market conditions of soybeans and other items.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Prices of Hardware, Dong White Iron, and Galvanized Iron are Falling <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>| More Than 500 Boxes of New Galvanized Iron Have Arrived |</p>
<p>▲ Dong/White/Iron: Recently, the sales market has been declining. For example, 3-foot by 3-foot is estimated to be $1.30 per sheet, down by 5 cents from before. 3-foot by 6-foot is $1.03, also down by 3 cents from before. However, many goods have arrived in recent days, and the cost is very low. For example, the purchase price for 7-foot is only $1.24 or $1.25. 6-foot is $1.00 upon entry. Therefore, those with goods have a very soft mentality, and the market may continue to soften.</p>
<p>Galvanized Iron: New goods of galvanized iron, which have been out of stock for many days, arrived at the Huashun Wharf yesterday, with more than 500 boxes. Therefore, there is no longer a shortage panic in the market. The standard is also more moderate than before. It is estimated to be $55 per box. It is heard that more than 100 boxes were sold yesterday, purchased by a tobacco company.</p>
<p>Piece Goods and Woolens: Only Women's Colors Have Sales</p>
<p>Since each customer gang stopped buying woolens, they have relied solely on this street. Therefore, in addition to 1005-Ma tweed and herringbone tweed, there is an oversupply of various autumn and winter Chinese and Western woolens from various countries, and the goods are abundant.</p>
<p>Step relaxation, observing the sales of the Shanghai woolen market yesterday, only women's overcoat woolens are active. Various women's woolens, such as three to four yuan per yard of dotted water wave twill, etc., are purchased by the 28 women's clothing shops in the Simalu area, in varying quantities. The sales of men's woolens are not as good. Famous men's clothing stores in the Xiafei Road Sichuan Road area are now reducing purchases. This is because their inventory is abundant, and the sales are not as rapid as women's colors.</p>

<h3 id="e283">British Emperor Hosts Feast for the Poor <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Chao Jiao</p>
<p>It is reported that the British Emperor hosted a feast for 700 poor people in the Whitechapel on Christmas Day. It is said that this is a regular annual custom. The Emperor hosting a feast for the poor - what a delightful piece of news this is! The Emperor is recognized as the most supreme and noble figure in British society, and the so-called 700 poor people, although not all are so impoverished as to have nowhere to set foot (I imagine that if they were truly so impoverished as to have nowhere to set foot, they would not in reality be so honored as to be invited to a feast by the Emperor; the poor who are invited to the Emperor's feast, although called poor, must still have some, albeit not large, but somewhat small, history of some kind. Otherwise, why would the poor who are invited to the feast be limited to just these 700?), but they are generally some extremely destitute so-called poor people. These 700 poor people who have always been extremely destitute, suddenly sit together with the one who has always been called the most supreme and noble Emperor, toasting face to face (but whether they are actually toasting face to face is still a question; perhaps the Emperor sends a representative to host these poorly-dressed poor people - that may very well be the case), shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries (?), just imagine, what an honorable thing this must be.</p>
<p>However, we find it very regrettable that the so-called poor people whom the Emperor deigns to show favor to in this instance (as happens every year) are unfortunately limited to 700, and that the feast is limited to only one occasion. How can the many other poor people (Britain has three million unemployed people) all be able to be graciously invited to this feast, and, even for those poor people who are able to be invited to this feast, how can they all be able to eat that extremely rich meal gifted by the Emperor every year, every day? This then becomes an extremely serious and difficult-to-solve problem.</p>
<p>The Emperor can prepare some not very rich (as I imagine, probably not very rich at all) wine and dishes every Christmas to invite a small portion of the poor to a feast, but he cannot distribute more bread so that a wider population of the unemployed can all have something to eat. This is a very regrettable event. How will the Emperor use what method to ensure that the general poor can just eat coarse black bread and be satisfied? This is a highly debatable question.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Rickshaw Puller Zhang Fusheng <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Yang</p>
<p>I already knew that rickshaws were in use in my hometown; however, besides the main road that can barely accommodate rubber wheels, the other small roads are so bumpy that even when sitting in a sedan chair, one feels like they're about to fall apart. So, I thought that rickshaws were only used by a few local gentry youths to show off on the main street. But, when I stepped off the train carrying my luggage, I was surrounded by a swarm of rickshaw pullers. Looking ahead, I saw nearly a hundred rickshaws lined up along both sides of the road. This was beyond my expectations. Seeing such a display, it was undeniable that the small roads where outsiders stumbled three times for every step must have been improved. Otherwise, the rickshaw company's losses on the vehicles would be too great, and where would the business for nearly a hundred rickshaws come from?</p>
<p>As I stood there dumbfounded, suddenly a huge</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>hand snatched my luggage. At the same time, a shout of "Young Master" came from who knows which rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>Helplessly, my gaze followed the giant arm upward. It turned out to be a short, farmer-like man. Looking at his face, where his nose and eyebrows were almost connected, I clearly remembered that he was my classmate Zhang Fusheng from elementary school. At this moment, seeing that the business had already been taken, the group of rickshaw pullers swarmed towards the next arrival.</p>
<p>Zhang Fusheng took my luggage and said in a commanding tone:</p>
<p>"This way, Young Master!"</p>
<p>He darted out of the station's wooden fence like a monkey, placed my luggage on the footpad of a rickshaw, and squatted between the two shafts, waiting for me to get in.</p>
<p>When I sat in his rickshaw, he lifted the shafts and whistled, as if to show off to his companions, and then took off running.</p>
<p>The small road extending in front of the station was originally lined with fields. Farmers, for the convenience of drawing water, had dug large gaps along the road. Moreover, the roots of several large trees along the road stretched into the middle of the road like mountain ranges. If one walked at night, a careless step could send you tumbling into the rice paddies, covered in mud. Now, these giant old trees had been cut down, and the gaps had been filled in. Naturally, the tree roots that obstructed pedestrians were also gone. So, although it wasn't as good as Shanghai's Bubbling Well Road, there was no danger of crashing into the rice paddies with the rickshaw.</p>
<p>Fusheng pulled the rickshaw especially fast. He had already taken the lead. As the road ahead gradually narrowed, I couldn't help but blurt out:</p>
<p>"Fusheng, pull it slowly."</p>
<p>Fusheng was naturally surprised that an outsider could call out his name. He quickly stopped the rickshaw, turned around, and asked:</p>
<p>"Young Master is a local?"</p>
<p>"Don't you recognize me? We studied at ×× Elementary School together."</p>
<p>Then he slowed down, turned around several times to examine me, and finally said:</p>
<p>"It's been too many years. I can't remember what Young Master's name is!"</p>
<p>"That's right, you were a year above me. I heard that you were sent from the school to higher elementary school?" I chatted with him in detail.</p>
<p>"Oh, I remember," he said. "Young Master is called Zhu ××, right? The principal sent me to higher elementary school, but only the first year was free. The second year, my family couldn't afford the fees, so my dad didn't want me to study anymore. At that time, my family had a few acres of land to farm ourselves. We originally had to hire people to help with the farming, but I helped out as half a worker. But in recent years, it's really been unlucky..."</p>
<p>The rickshaw had reached a fork in the road. He turned west and asked me again:</p>
<p>I replied, "Yes." He continued, saying:</p>
<p>"In recent years, the land hasn't yielded enough. I sold a few acres of land and now I'm farming for others. Now that the new rice is on the market, I come out to pull a rickshaw in my spare time to earn some money. Did Young Master make a fortune in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>He seemed to be waiting for my answer, and stopped talking. But I didn't answer him, even though he turned around twice to look at my face.</p>
<p>When we arrived home, I paid the fare. I felt a sorrow like being oppressed by a thick fog in my heart.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Zhao Family Village Shrouded in the Early Winter Dusk <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Yang</p>
<p>It was an early winter dusk</p>
<p>The sky was like the face of a fallen person, kissing the distant treetops with its ashen gray.</p>
<p>The wind vigorously carried the unmanaged fallen leaves across the fields after the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>The stone road leading to the town was turning fish-belly white in the vastness. At the corner of the road stood a tall banner, more than ten feet high, with the words "Zhao Family Village Regular Force" written on it. It was erected after conscription. It roared proudly in the wind, as if it had the mission of protecting the village's security.</p>
<p>Zhao Family Village, surrounded by dozens of bungalows and multi-story buildings, judging from its appearance, it must have seen the enthronement of the Tongzhi Emperor. At this time, smoke was rising from the chimneys of every house, like signal fires. Several village women with blue cloths covering their heads were straining their throats, calling out the names of their husbands and sons at the corner of the road. Then, farmers in blue cloth jackets and snot-nosed cowherds, as if summoned, shuffled with hunched backs from the small bridge into the white-board doors facing the river.</p>
<p>Several peddlers returning from the market in the town three miles away moved like scales on the fish-belly white road. They were worried that their mothers and wives were waiting for them to eat dinner, but looking at the many unsold oranges, bananas, candies, and cakes remaining on their shoulders, they feared they couldn't make the accounting. So, they shouted with a hundredfold advertising power in front of every eave, and the seductive sound waves stirred up a group of children who had just returned from school. They all used their black, shiny eyes to pick out which load was good, which one was big, which one wasn't rotten. After several business disputes, they satisfied both parties' desires with a cheaper price.</p>
<p>The children scattered, and feeling that their pockets were much heavier, their steps suddenly became lighter, and they went to another small road, again like scales.</p>
<p>The throats of people on boats echoed in the reeds. The fisherman who had just risen from the water, wearing a light cotton coat, was sitting on the bow of the boat, sipping from a wine bottle. The fisherwoman with a bun was busy in the cabin, sorting out the day's harvest. Several people who had gone out to make money with great difficulty were bowing and haggling over the price of fish and crabs with them at the dock. Only when they felt it was cheap in their mental calculations did they take out one or two double-cent coins from their close-fitting pockets and drop a string of crab with white foam and river fish wagging their tails into the boat.</p>
<p>The sharp sound of the Ningguan Road last bus's horn echoed through the evening air, followed by a series of sparse dog barks.</p>
<p>Several travelers carrying luggage returned from the station two miles away. They all knocked on their own doors with a joyful heart, and they all prepared a set of unexpected emotions to give to their beloveds.</p>
<p>The pen of Father Time added a night scene more realistic than the painter, and the surroundings were quiet. Darkness swallowed everything in Zhao Family Village.</p>

<h3 id="e287">Stalin in Swaddling Clothes <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Qujiang</p>
<p>The majestic Caucasus Mountains dominate the crucial route between Europe and Asia. It is a meeting point of all places, where over a hundred ethnic groups live, and tribalism and imperialism run parallel. This is the birthplace of Bolshevik leader Stalin.</p>
<p>In the village of Gori in Georgia, there was a family named Diugashvili, whose ancestors were farmers and cobblers. When farming could no longer sustain them, Vissarion from the Djnagashvili family left his hometown and drifted to the neighboring village of Ogri, working as a worker in a shoe factory.</p>
<p>Vissarion's wife, named Ekaterina, was a Georgian woman. Georgian women marry at the age of thirteen or fourteen because they mature earlier than ordinary women. By the age of thirty-five, they are already old. Therefore, Ekaterina became a mother very early and continued to have three children, but they all died soon after. The fourth child was about to be born around Christmas. She was a devout Christian woman, and she prayed to God to give her a son who would grow up. She named the child Joseph in advance.</p>
<p>Joseph Stalin was born on December 21, 1879. Ekaterina was only twenty years old at the time. She nicknamed Stalin "Soso." "Soso" was originally the name of a beloved animal in Georgia. Ekaterina had great plans for the child and held ardent ambitions. She even hoped that "Soso" would become a great man of the world in the future.</p>
<p>Stalin's future was deeply influenced by his mother. His father was just a clumsy shoemaker, but his mother was an extraordinary woman. She possessed extremely strong perseverance, and she was determined that her son would take the position of pastor in the future.</p>
<p>Stalin's infancy was spent in the village of Gori. Gori is the capital of Georgia and also a place with beautiful scenery. Its secondary school was top-ranked in the area, so it can also be called an educational center.</p>
<p>The Russo-Turkish War had just ended a year before "Soso" was born. When Russian Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in Saint Petersburg, Soso was only fifteen months old. While the Caucasus Mountains echoed with the call for a joint Turkish rebellion against Russia, Soso was still a helpless infant.</p>
<p>Ekaterina often praised her own child. Stalin had excellent grades in school, and his attitude was also very good, so he was quite loved by his teachers. But his body was not very strong, and his family had always been poor, without sufficient food to nourish him. He had smallpox once at the age of seven. Even now, there are still some traces on his face!</p>
<p>"Soso is really a good child," his mother later often solemnly stated, "I never have to punish him. He studies very hard... Soso is my only son, no wonder I love him so much. His father only hoped that he would become a good shoemaker, but Soso also passed away when he was eleven years old. What about me? I don't want Soso to be a shoemaker, but I hope he will be a pastor!"</p>
<p>Stalin received a scholarship when he graduated from elementary school. His early life was undoubtedly frugal. After his father passed away, his mother relied on sewing to barely make a living, and she also saved some money to pay for Soso's education. But this Soso has not disappointed his loving mother's expectations and hard work!</p>

<h3 id="e293">The Miserable Situation of a Hollywood Extra <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Xuemei</p>
<p>Outside the gate of the film studio stood a crowd of people, men, women, old and young. Among them were former actors from vaudeville troupes, former jockeys, failed entrepreneurs, Chinese girls, ruined millionaires, beggars, etc., but the most heartbroken were the former movie stars and comedians, eliminated by the changing trends of the film industry. They all waited with anticipation, hoping that the gate of the film studio would open its mouth and swallow them all in. "How's your luck?" someone asked a gaunt young woman. She smiled and said, "I've only worked one day in the last seven months. But I'm used to being hungry. Look at that man in the blue velvet vest. I'm much better off than him. I remember he used to be a big manager in a personnel department."</p>
<p>We all know that Hollywood is a dazzling paradise. But in its lower levels, countless wandering souls are seething. They want to break through the golden earth and flood the entire Hollywood with the lava of resentment. There are fifteen thousand extras there, all of whose names are registered with the central personnel employment office. Calling them extras is wronging them, because they may work one day every six months, or never get work at all. They are all hoping—living in hope, eating in hope. But if they are not called extras, or if they do not call themselves extras, they would cut off a line of hope and be unable to endure hunger and cold, waiting for a chance to fall from the sky in the wind and rain. The gates of the film studio are always closed to them. Those who are born in hope will soon die in hope.</p>
<p>How will Hollywood deal with this group of people? Who created this tragedy? It's strange to say. This tragedy was created by the extras themselves. The only way to solve it is to ask the extras themselves to handle it. This group of people, oppressed by economic difficulties and the pain of unemployment, and on the other hand, hearing many rumors of Hollywood's wealth and extravagance, all flocked to Hollywood. When they got there, they registered with the central employment office. Day after day passed. But hope was getting smaller and smaller, the money they brought was gradually running out, they had no food or clothing, and they couldn't pay the rent. But they refused to go elsewhere, still hoping. As for the company, due to economic reasons, it reduced the large scenes in the films, which further reduced the extras' jobs. The following is a tragic scene outside a film studio:</p>
<p>A young extra came out of the casting department of a company, dejected, and mingled with the rest of the extras, lingering and reluctant to leave. "No luck?" someone asked him. He said, "I already got a job, but because I didn't have a pair of glasses, they didn't want me. Buying a pair of glasses costs at least five dollars, where would I get that much money?" He sighed as he spoke. An old man behind him silently took off his glasses and handed them to the young man, saying, "Take them, child. I can't see without glasses, but I can sit here and wait for you." The young man quickly reached out to take the glasses, but when he heard what the old man said, he withdrew his hand and said, "That won't do. You know, once I go in, I might not be able to come out until late at night." The old man said, "It doesn't matter. Take them. Haven't you been hungry for several days? I'll sit at the entrance of that alley and wait for you." The young man thanked him and went in. The old man groped to the entrance of the alley and sat down, unable to move for a day, because he couldn't move an inch without glasses. It was getting late, the sun was setting, and a cold wind was blowing, piercingly cold. Fortunately, the young man came back after eight o'clock. He apologized to the old man, saying, "I'm really sorry. But no matter what, we'll have dinner tonight." He happily put the glasses on the old man and helped him to a nearby restaurant for dinner.</p>
<p>It is a common thing for five or six extras to squeeze into a small room. When the company needs someone, they get busy, your clothes, my shoes, his tie, they put them together and give them to one person, and send him to represent them. When that person comes back from work for a day, everyone has food to eat. The rest, without pants, without clothes, without shoes, sit on the bed and wait. Two beautiful young women even settled down in a cottage in the countryside near Hollywood because they had no place to live. But they are still constantly hoping.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e294">Review of "Happiness Ahead" <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Happiness Ahead</p>
<p>| Da Guangming</p>
<p>This is a timely work. As the New Year is about to come, "Happiness Ahead," which takes the happy New Year as its theme, is being screened in the happy mood of people.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this film gives people a full sense of relaxation and pleasure. Such as the New Year's Eve in the dance hall opened by the Chinese, such as in the skating rink, such as when the male protagonist sings while wiping the windows, there is a very good lively atmosphere. This light and lively atmosphere constitutes the main part of the play, and the playwright or director has achieved their goal of making people happy. But we cannot ignore the theme of the work because of these.</p>
<p>What is the theme of the work? In the highly developed capitalist America, it is naturally a very common phenomenon that workers cannot easily marry a rich girl. This phenomenon is not very satisfactory, so he made the rich lady oppose the marriage arranged by her mother, unwilling to marry the young master who is well-matched, and accidentally fall in love with a working youth, a small clerk in a cleaning company. In terms of love, this is what the playwright considers reasonable. But their combination is not without conditions, that is, the male protagonist must have lofty aspirations, strive to climb up from his original position, and start his own cleaning company. He must not take ill-gotten wealth. He must be a gentleman in the eyes of the rich lady. So the lady asked her father to help her lover with a capital of two thousand yuan. After the misunderstanding was explained, the man and woman of two different status were combined.</p>
<p>This play tries its best to cater to the audience's interest in the way of expression, and tries its best to make the plot twists and turns, but it is very far-fetched that the lady refuses to tell her lover her identity, so she rents an apartment, she turns several corners to pay the lover, her father refuses to admit to the male protagonist that he is his father-in-law immediately, these are all for the sake of making a play.</p>
<p>In addition, the actress's acting skills are not mature enough.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Minor Chronicle of "Flying Flower Village" <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>When "Flying Flower Village" went to Linping to shoot on location, Zheng Yingshi was afraid that everyone would be hungry on the way, so he brought a large box of cakes from Shanghai. Unexpectedly, after everyone ate it, they all had intestinal pain, almost causing a disaster. Therefore, when he came back, Zheng Yingshi said to everyone he met, "Damn it, I almost lost my life because of the cake." This is also a strange anecdote in location shooting.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan, who plays Xiao Hua, is only six years old this year. But she is very clever and knows ten things from one. When the song "Shepherdess" was recorded, it was highly appreciated by the Western orchestra of Victory Records, who frequently called her "Little Sweetheart".</p>
<p>There is a court scene in the play "Flying Flower Village". In order to make the plot atmosphere realistic, Zheng Yingshi specially rushed to the court to listen to the trial one day. It happened that he was trying a case of seduction, which coincided with the plot in his play. Therefore, the atmosphere of the court scene in "Flying Flower Village" is particularly tense and powerful.</p>
<p>In the recent cold north wind, "Flying Flower Village" once reshot a scene, which was the scene of Gao Zhanfei taking a bath after work. Gao Zhanfei caught a cold because of this, and was in bed for about ten days before getting up.</p>
<p>The most stressful time for "Flying Flower Village" was in the hot summer of June, but the staff of all departments did not stop working because of the hot weather, so there were several cases of heatstroke every day. For example, Qin Tong fainted once and was rushed to the Red Cross for emergency treatment before waking up.</p>
<p>Shi Dongshan completed "Woman" on the day he got a daughter, and the result was indeed beautiful. Zheng Yingshi completed "Flying Flower Village" on the day he got a son, and the result was even more beautiful. Therefore, colleagues who are good at humor, such as Hu Rui, the director of "Elegy of Life", often hold up a stool and shout loudly: "Look at the old man in the sky, bless my old wife who I haven't seen for more than ten years to give birth to a precious son soon, and support my "Elegy of Life"!" Very funny. (But)</p>

<p>— Su Hua</p>
<p>Donald hurriedly replied as if to explain, "Oh! Yes, but it's all too confusing and I can't get rid of it." He stopped suddenly as he said this, and Suria stood up. He also stood up and said, "Do you want me to stay here?" Donald smiled reluctantly, "What are you talking about? Nothing in the world can make me leave you." She continued, "Then I will be confused, maybe I won't be able to get rid of it, what about you?" This stumped Donald. He couldn't say anything. Suria scolded in her heart, "All you need is Fifi, a dancer, you call yourself romantic, but you don't even understand love." Donald couldn't bear it anymore, he pretended to be calm and said, "Please don't ruin tonight?" Suria heard this and said angrily, "Huh, ruin tonight? I won't ruin your tonight, you want your happiness, come here." Saying that, she rushed outside, pointed at Donald and shouted downstairs, "Listen up, this gentleman wants you to accompany him tonight." Then she said to Donald, "They are all here, they are all your tonight. I won't bother you tomorrow." After speaking, she ran downstairs, and finally she said to Donald, "I regret not knowing you were like this sooner." After speaking, she left Maisie. Donald ran to the window and watched her and her car disappear into the night. He was disappointed, and in the room, he drank bottle after bottle of champagne, muttering Fifi's name.</p>
<p>It was the next evening. In Donald's hotel room, Ambassador Buff suddenly arrived and told his servant that if he didn't find Donald and bring him to the embassy immediately, he would be court-martialed. His servant hurriedly took the military uniform and ran to Maisie to find him. The room was full of champagne bottles. He was sleeping soundly. He wouldn't wake up even if you called him. He wanted to close the door and change his clothes for him. After a while, his servant was thrown out, shouting, "He refuses to take off his clothes." The women waiting outside unexpectedly rushed inside. Underwear, outerwear, pants, socks, etc. were all thrown out of the room. Donald was finally dressed in military uniform by this group of people. But he was still drunk, and he was still saying that he would never marry that widow for money. He refused to go to the embassy no matter what. Later, he was pushed and shoved into the car by the women and taken to the embassy. When the car arrived, the embassy was already very chaotic, and the ambassador was anxious and at a loss. As soon as he got out of the car, the ambassador helped him into a small reception room and hurriedly poured coffee into him. He woke up, but still refused to see the widow. The ambassador didn't care about him, went out and brought the widow in to introduce her. After a while, the ambassador came back. He was supporting a noble lady. When Donald saw her, he was stunned. It turned out that the noble lady was the widow, and the widow was Fifi, whom he missed so much. The ambassador introduced them. A triumphant smile appeared on Donald's face, and he leaned down to kiss Suria's weave. She slowly said, "Do you want to take off the veil?" "It's not good, I'm not jumping over the wall." He replied comically. The ambassador standing next to them felt confused when he heard them talking. Donald continued, "Since yesterday, I have been madly in love with a woman, but she left me, her name is Fifi, now only you can help me find her." Suria said with a bitter face, "You should sentence her to death. She left you last night and committed suicide in the hotel." The ambassador was so angry when he heard this that he almost fainted and ran out immediately. They also walked to the garden, and Donald gently said, "I love you so much that it makes me crazy." She replied coldly, "Everyone says they love me, what do they love me for? My beauty? My liveliness? Or my money?" He also replied coldly, "I don't know what others are like, but I am completely for your money." She didn't find it strange. She turned around and used her fan to hit his face. They looked at each other silently, and the music inside sounded. (To be continued)</p>
