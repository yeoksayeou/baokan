<p>時評</p>
<h3>銀價變動影響於遠東市塲　果</h3>
<p>自美國政府積極提高銀價。收買存銀之說起。於是我國國内各方面。對於一九三三年倫敦八國白銀恊定應否批准之問題。隨之而生。本報曾就倫敦恊定之意義與美國企圖開闢遠東市場之必然結局。略有論列。惟銀價變動以後。對於遠東市塲（包括中國。與日本之殖民地。及南洋印度各地。）究將發生若何程度之影響乎。則亦不可不加以相當之研究也。</p>
<p>夫銀價之變動。近十餘年來。頗稱激烈。以一九二九年之平均價值論。較之一九二○年之銀價。低昻相去。約達三倍。自是以後。銀價之低落。且臻於歷史未有之最低記錄焉。羅斯福總統登臺後。首則締結倫敦八國公約。繼復收買國内生銀。定價六角四分有半。凡此要皆以减少銀之供給。提高銀之市價爲依歸。蓋以爲若是者。一足以增進九萬萬人民之購買能力。二足以挽救世界工業生産之危機。必能領導今日之世界。以脱於當前之險境。其用意非不甚是。惟以世界如此日趨低落之銀價。而謂依美國之計劃。卽能提高。甚且恢復一九二○年每盎士值八十便士以上之勝况。遠東人民之購買力。由此卽日趨於富有者。吾人誠未敢信。</p>
<p>今日遠東各國及各殖民地人民之經濟發展狀况。較之歐美各先進國家。誠深感落後。然其所以如此。則正由於彼等肆意施行經濟侵略。知以殖民地爲過剩商品與資本之尾閭。罔能以扶植殖民地經濟之繁榮爲任務。旣非貨幣本位不同之關係。尤非銀價低落之影響有以致之。卽以我國論。當歐戰之時。銀價甚高。厥後十年之間。稍趨低落。然猶平均在三十便士以上。迨乎九二九年。銀價突呈低落。論理宜足以刺激貿易之輸出。然實際則入超反日以增加。是可知銀價之低昻。均不足利用爲增進國民經濟福利之圖。更可知今日遠東殖民地購買能力所以不能抬高之原因。固在彼而不在此也。</p>
<p>至於銀價變動之次要影響。則爲遠東各地現銀之移動狀况。以吾國而論。銀價高則現銀有易於流出之患。證之以近兩年來之現銀出超。此或宜然。但請因此卽足以使遠東之現銀。盡爲搜括以去。似亦不免過甚其辭。蓋徵之過去。如歐戰之時。固曾有此現象。而在今日情勢之下。恐尚不患無適當之方法以補救之也。</p>
<p>總之銀價變動所生之影響。誠爲國人所當密切注意之事。然其爲禍爲福。兩者俱等。何嘗有一定標凖之可言。要在當局如何審愼應付此環境。如何善爲利用之而巳。</p>

<h3>巴黎市民暴動之一幣（巴黎航空通信）</h3>
<p>示威者衝破警察防綫</p>

<h3>南疆組織僞府攝影之八</h3>

<p>五·回匪首領馬占倉、</p>
<p>六·纒匪首領鐵木耳、</p>
<p>七·回匪旅長科麻子（鄢耆人）、</p>
<p>八·艾捫蛋白克阿吉（阿富汗人）、</p>
<p>九·克棄克匪團長、</p>
<p>其後面站立各人、概係馬占倉之衛隊、</p>
<p>是預算的不均衡、國庫收入的不足、引起了一般人民的極度反感、從極右到極左、都滿懷怨望、想打破現局、另創一種局面、但總不容易得</p>
<p>到煽動羣衆的機緣、這回恰好遇着了巴容廬市經營的典當、發行不正當的市債、更引動人民的反感、并牽涉到旭丹内閣的閣員和前任警察總監、於是市民齊聲怨憤、一經右派的號召、遂形成多數的羣衆、這事情的發端、在一月下旬、到二月初頭、醖釀就更見積極、法政府雖力持鎭靜、但是保皇黨·社會黨·共産黨·都努力煽動、到了二月六日下午、就發生了大暴動、示威者手持石頭、木棒在康柯爾脱橋突破了警察防綫、圍住了議院、當時負傷的人民和警官、非公開的調查、說是有四百餘、死亡的人有十二個、直到今晨還没有平息、</p>
<p>現在且暫不叙述暴動的情形、先來報告釀成這暴動的經過、原來巴容廬市營典當的不法事件、究竟何如、我們還不易卽下判斷、但曾經過警廳與内務部的調查、據說這種不法債券的發行、爲數約有四億以至於五億法郎、此種債券的發行者、就是該典當的首長特息、在普通的情形、要發行債劵、總需在政府登記、這四五億法郎的債券、全部由特息私自發行、未經政府登記、</p>
<p>其發覺的經過、是投資者之一的耶爾彭保險公司、把滿了期的債券要求償還、却没有回音、因此卽爲政府所發覺、特息立卽被捕、其被捕就時日、是去年十二月二十五日、經過了幾度研究之後、曉得了這次不法事件的主動人、不是特息、而是另一有聲譽的人、這個人名呌亞利山大·斯塔維斯基、</p>
<p>斯塔維斯基是惹起這次大暴動的中心人物、在我們祖國内人對他、或許還不大明白、所以特作一個簡單的介紹、斯塔維斯基是俄羅斯·希臘人、他的父親是牙科醫生、在大戰之前、纔進入法國籍、他爲人非常聰明、他是欺詐騙局的前科屢犯者、在法國他是一九二六年纔出名的、他的正業是事業發起人、地産公司、寳石公司·高架鐵道·地下鐵道等等事業、都是他發起的對象、一九二六年、當時他所以突然有名的原因、也與這次一樣、是阿連公營典當發行不法債劵的事、但因證據不充分、他就被釋放出來、因此法國一般社會週知他是偉大的騙子、從那時以後、他所發起的事業、遂擴大到國際方面、特别是在匈牙利的活動、他收買凍結了的債劵、以爲操縱市塲的工具、在巴黎他曾經營好幾所劇塲、還有「維俄龍特」新報在他的支配之下、他的投機性非常豐富、在賭博的時候、雖一擲百萬亦毫不變色、一九二六年的大欺詐案、漸次向黑暗裏隱去、他也就與黑暗成反比例、一天的一天的發達他的聲譽、巴黎社交界、到處都有他的足跡、</p>
<p>這次不法發行債券的事、特息被捕之後、他也被傳詢、又因爲證據不足而被釋放了、可是自從釋放他的那一天起、巴黎社交塲上、再不見他的影子、於是乎引起巴黎市民特别是右派各政黨底下的羣衆疑慮得更厲害、他們以爲他是巴容廬市營典當的發起人、而特息又是他的親友、則他是作騙局的核心人物、用不着再要什麽證據、這問題就漸次嚴重化、竟至於牽動了旭丹内閣、殊不知一月九日斯塔維斯基自殺的消息公布了、問題暫時簡單化、旭丹内閣也得苟安、可是斯塔維斯基的自殺還是隱在黑幕裏、右派的「巴黎回聲報、」社會主義的機關報「人民、」一齊表示懷疑、并痛擊政府、旭丹終於不能支持、達拉第上台後何如、也是疑問、巴黎的羣衆、正到處唱着馬賽曲、高唱着「打倒政府」、「把前警察總監夏白投獄」的口號、遊行示威遍滿巴黎、昨日的繁華、今天突成恐怖、未來的情形怎樣、眞是不敢輕於判斷啊（一九三四年二月七日晨於巴黎）</p>

<h3>桂省經濟調查印象記（三）千家駨</h3>
<p>抵梧州後、我們住在大南酒店、决定明天一早雇車赴邕寗、自梧至邕、計程千餘里、水陸兩道、均可通達、水路經由平南·桂平·貴縣·横縣·永淳等處、如坐邕梧快輪約須三日、陸道卽公路、經由容縣·北流·玉林·貴縣·賓陽等處、坐汽車最快一天、但須於清晨四時啓程、晚八九時始到、慢則二天、在貴縣住夜、我們是想一天趕到的、小的行李自己携帶、大的則交由輪船轉運、是日下午、白副司令和夏軍長具柬約我們和德醫史大夫在羣樂樓吃飯、先一點鐘、邱副官以車來迎、先環繞梧市一周、繼登中山公園、參觀中山紀念堂、該堂在山頂上、俯視梧市、見撫河與大河滙流於此、水色一綠一黄、涇渭分明、似把全市都包圍在水中一般、桂人亦名之曰鴛江、誠勝景也、參觀中山紀念堂後、便到酒樓、是時白副總司令尚在邕寗、夏軍長亦未到、作陪者有各參謀長處長公安局局長等、我們順便告訴他們、將來還許要特别到梧州來作經濟調查、需要他們幫忙的地方很多、從羣樂樓出來、又有梧州民國日報及大公報（非天津之大公報）記者來訪、談了半句鐘、記者走後、我們就蒙被睡覺、預備第二天的長途奔波、</p>
<p>次早四點鐘、邱副官就把我們喊醒、起來盥洗旣畢、將零星物件稍加整理、就踱出了旅館、到輪渡碼頭去、此時晨光曦微、街上黑漆漆看不見一個人影、有一二個巡警、也正在馬路邊上打盹、到輪渡碼頭後、還要坐了一點多鐘的『洋划子』、才到戎墟汽車站、（邕梧公路僅通至梧州之戎墟）、到時天才發亮、我們四個人、坐上僱好的小車、車就開足馬力飛馳前奔了、這一段公路雖然比較還算平穩、但因車的速率開得太快、所以顚簸得非常厲害、我們經過了岑溪·容縣·北流·玉林·興業·等處、沿途忽而大雨傾盆、忽而酷日當空、宛如在沙漠上旅行一樣、同時在農作物上、亦可表現出各地氣候的差異來、有的禾實纍纍、將近收穫之期、有的地方、稻禾才不過一尺來長、過貴縣後、山狀就有些與我們日常習見的不同了、岩山峯巒、挺秀奇翠、我們亦如劉姥姥之初入大觀園、贊不絕聲、目不暇接、幾忘置身旅途中、直到後來到陽朔桂林、見岡巒之千奇萬狀、才知今日之所見者、還不過桂省山水之糟粕而已、</p>
<p>我們的車直到晚上九時、才抵南寗、經過這十六小時的苦鬥、兼之途中不時的晴雨與無定的寒暑、非但身體疲乏到極點、同時我又患了感冐、吃了兩片阿司匹靈後、就蒙被入睡、第二天一早起來、我們往省政府趨謁省政府主席黄旭初先生、黄氏沉默寡言、當是個富於涵養而又不缺乏决斷力的人物、我們約略報告此行旅途中之經過、我們本定關於實地經濟調查、擬在南寗對廣西之經濟問題、根據現有資料作縝密之研究後、再行計劃、藉免閉門造車之嫌、現在很願意聽聽他們幾位最高領袖對於廣西經濟建設的意見、黄氏的態度誠懇而又謙虚、他首先對我們此行、表示十分歡迎、關於廣西經濟建設問題、他說自己完全是個門外漢、希望我們研究經濟的專家予以指敎云云、他隨卽請統計局局長楊綽庵先生負責招待我們、因爲統計局有許多現成的書籍和統計資料、所以我們就借住在廣西統計局、</p>

<h3>市商會電請德使切實宣示對僞滿態度</h3>
<p>并函駐滬德商會注意</p>
<p>市商會以德國近有承認僞滿擬議、報載該國雖有否認消息、但無切實表示、是以特電該國駐平公使、請其切實宣示對僞滿態度、并函德商會注意、兹錄原文如下</p>
<h3>電德公使</h3>
<p>北平德國公使鑒、貴我兩國合作事業、近來極有進展、此種連鎖、完全建築於貴國對華同情基礎之上、尤以貴國上年列席國聯時對於東三省案、所持公正態度、爲敝國稱誦、惟近來國際時有流言、謀以離間兩國交誼、諒已爲貴公使所熟知、敝會爲保持兩國商業前途計、極願貴使能將貴國對華同情及其所抱公正態度、再行切實宣示、并將敝國輿論對於此項問題重視之意、轉致貴國政府爲盼、上海市商會、</p>
<h3>函德商會</h3>
<p>逕啓者、貴我兩國合作事業、近來極有進展、此種情形、當爲貴會所稔知、而爲兩國前途、共相慶幸、敝會揆其致此之由來、蓋以貴我兩國所處環境、同在艱難奮鬭之中、故對華同情之心、自然流露、徵諸貴國上年列席國聯時、對於東三省案所抱公正態度、足以徵明敝會此言之不爽也、不幸近來國際方面、竟有謡傳之電文、涉及貴國、謂對於東三省案、將有改變從來政策之表示、此雖一種出於隂謀之反宣傳、冀以離間貴我兩國交誼、但敝國俗諺有云、無風不能起浪、所以敝會爲貴我兩國前途計、不能不嚴重注意、并盼貴會能以商界領袖之資格、將敝國人輿論、介紹於貴國政府、庶同時亦可唤起貴國政府對於此事嚴重注意也、此致駐滬德國商會、</p>
<h3>工部局董事會討論增加華董</h3>
<p>外籍納税人暫未能接納</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>六十四對三十六相去無幾、至所指一九二八年之五十五與四十五之比、乃係將市政捐·地皮税·執照費·碼頭捐·四項主要收入、合併計算之結果、此刻如以同樣方法計算、則其比例約爲五十七對四十三、如以某部分居民所供給市政費之多寡、爲其代表額數之惟一根據、此項見解、頗有反對之者、至於年來華董與外董、彼此關係、極爲和睦、此自因雙方皆努力互相了解互表同情之故、但外籍董事、深覺外籍納税人、對於華董增至於外董同數之議、在目前尚未能接納云、</p>

<h3>愛文義路鉅厦内破獲輪盤大賭窟</h3>
<p>與昔年茄西亞所設者相伯仲</p>
<p>主持者爲猶太白俄姚克蘇脱</p>
<p>巴西領事竟備函指爲巴西籍</p>
<p>但姚之國籍警務當局已查明</p>

<h3>巴西人茄西亞</h3>
<p>在同孚路所組織者相伯仲、故每晚往賭之徒、多輙近日、少亦四五十、雖風霜雨雪之夜、猶不稍衰、賭徒中西畢具、男女咸集、惟華人則較多、至於輸贏之鉅、彩金之豐、聞之有令人舌橋不下者、姚氏以客秋八月經營、迄於今兹、非法收入之數量、自甚可觀、警務當局、雖早有所聞、徒以未曾明瞭其底藴、故仍繼續密查、無夜不派幹探、赴該窟左近</p>
<h3>偵察賭徒出入</h3>
<p>最近更近一步、遴選幹探、喬裝賭客、混入窟内、始得盡窺全豹、並知確係姚氏所設、遂於前星期五、向第一特區地方法院請製發拘票及搜索證、原定是夜密往掩捕、不料該賭主神通廣大、事前竟被知風、當晚停止聚賭、姚復臨時避匿、致探員徒勞往返、一無所獲、且恐因此打草驚蛇、使該賭主遠颺、爰卽偵查</p>
<h3>姚之匿跡所在</h3>
<p>旋悉其避居百老匯路五百零四號、乃由靜安寺捕房西探惠司考司於前日上午十一時、偕同華探按址馳往、將姚氏拘獲、復於午後四時半、再往該賭窟搜查之下、抄出輪盤賭博之籌碼及計數使用之鉛筆九打、紙張橡皮圈檯毯多物、一併帶回捕房、當時駐滬巴西總領事得悉後、卽備公函兩封、一致第一特院郭院長、一致刑庭庭長、並</p>

<h3>市公用局收回定海島給電權</h3>
<p>定海島、原係濬浦局所塡之灘地、該處用電、向由上海電力公司供給、市公用局以該地旣属華界、而由外商越界給電、殊属有碍主權、經於二十年七月間、與濬浦總局交涉、改接華商電氣、一面令飭閘北水電公司、敷設水底電纜、供給電流、現在此項設備工程、己經告竣、卽於本年一月二十九日、改由該公司供電、市公用局、並於幹路上、裝設路燈、居民咸稱便利云、</p>

<h3>川帮抵制各輪漲價擬停辦商貨兩月</h3>
<p>各輪公司同盟新章</p>
<p>簽字後暫試辦兩月</p>
<p>滬上川河各輪局、進行合作同盟、將水脚提高、漲起百分之一百、已激起川帮全體反對、凖備兩個月的犧牲、以抵制各川輪、同盟合同、已經簽訂、記者再將此事之續訊、查報如下、</p>
<h3>華輪合作吃虧</h3>
<p>今次之川河輪大同盟、發起者爲捷江·太古·民生·怡和·等公司、而三北·光耀·等爲同時加入此合作範圍内者、當時華商輪公司、曾提出巫夔綫與萬縣埠之營業、向來祇行華輪、不准外國船往、英輪更不能駛萬縣、該兩處營業、照例不入公攤範圍内者、今次各公司代表在滬議訂立同、而將萬縣巫夔亦列進公攤條例之内、合同業巳簽字、據滬上航界中人言、今次川輪之大同盟、華商除民生以外、其餘均蒙損虧、蓋以素占優利的巫夔萬航業亦作公派、華輪殊不合算也、</p>
<h3>招商未曾加入</h3>
<p>招商局在川河内、原有峨嵋一輪、自上年七月内失事後、至今未曾救出、船底之礁石、已經轟毁、在春季漲水後、可望拖滬大修、自峨嵋失事至今、招商局川河内便無船行、將來峨嵋卽便修竣、亦將改航京漢快輪、川河暫無輪開行、故此次各公司同盟合作時、招商局未曾加入、</p>
<h3>同盟試辦兩月</h3>
<p>同盟合同、業經捷江·民生·太古·怡和·三北·光耀·等各公同實行簽字、其裝貨之水脚、照原訂價率、一律漲加百分之一百、棉花已增至二十四元一件、疋頭等每噸須漲至八十元、以上其他雜貨之斤量尺碼、更特别認眞、此回貨價、漲加之巨、實出意外、各輪公司鑒於客家之空氣不佳、乃議定暫且先行施辦兩個月、</p>
<h3>川帮準備犧牲</h3>
<p>滬上川帮各客家、對於今回各輪公司之增漲水脚、認爲過巨、屢次會議、僉以棉花每件本來實收祗有八元有奇、今幾增三分之二、雜貨更須毛斤收費、損虧太巨、一再請予酌减、爲各輪公司所拒却、現各川帮客家已經公同决定、在此新訂同盟兩個月試行期内、决抱忍痛犧牲主張停辦兩個月入川商貨、俟兩月期滿、各輪公司如能改善辦法、屆時再行恢復商運、否則屆時另議妥善之策、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>研究國際問題應該先從什麽地方着手？（一）</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>在迷霧裏，竟找着了讀書指導我是如何的慶幸啊！所以敢將我幾多時積下來的問題，提出來請敎於諸位先生，萬望給以公開的具體的答覆，</p>
<p>在未提出我的問題以前，先應將我的生活略爲叙述以便貴部指敎我是一個商家子弟，同時以農業爲副業，近年來受農村經濟破産的影響，商號早停閉了，上地也賣了，丨丨原來有二十餘畝丨丨現藉以維持生活的，就是買賣停閉後的所殘餘的舊賬；所以生活問題，是我目前極待解决的一個問題，我現在是個師範學校後期三年級生，失業的痛苦行將臨邇，所以我的前途又未容樂觀。</p>
<p>諸位先生，我是這樣一個人，下面再說我愛好研究的東西，我雖涉身師範，我却好研究國際問題，目的是：想從現實的問題中探討國際政治經濟之動問，以便認明將來的趨勢，但我不喜愛外國文字，且素無一點經濟學常識，</p>
<p>我以前研究的材料有兩種，卽看報與看各種雜誌我深知這兩種材料是欠缺的很，但苦無相當指導的人與受經濟的限制，不能多購較完整的成本書，所以只好如此的做下去，直到現在，發生了兩種困難：報紙上所刊載的没有系統，且找不出某種問題發生的主要因素、只是些事實的排列，眞僞尚屬兩可，（二），看雜誌也盡是些人云亦云的話，對於事實的裏面，很少揮發，其所持的理由，也並無多大的出入，所差者發表有先後，時間的問題耳，由這兩種錯誤，證明我以前花費了時間得到的代價是個空虚！同時又感到認識力的困難。這不得不來一次重整旗鼓，於是便發生了下列的幾個問題：</p>
<p>Ａ，像我這樣生活境遇的一個人，應不應研究國際問題？能不能研究？</p>
<p>Ｂ，研究國際問題，應該先從什麽地方着手？</p>
<p>Ｃ，如何才能養成正確的認識力？</p>
<p>Ｄ，一個不懂外國文字和素無經濟學常識的人，研究國際問題，能不能滿足我的那種慾望？假使不能，如何才能滿足？</p>
<p>Ｅ，想的要研究經濟學，又應該先從什麽地方着手？</p>
<p>上面這些問題，都在急迫的需要諸位具體答覆，我只有佇候明敎了。</p>

<h3>三恨</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>宋兪文豹說：「余有三恨，一無子，二無助，三無成，抱兹苦心，娛　以文字，旣絕筆於斯錄，復長吟以繫之，可笑春蠶有許痴，年年辛苦爲他誰？恰如貧女飛梭了，掛體何曾有一些。」乃是題在他所撰的吹劍錄後面的，在他原是老實話，有了這三恨纔有吹劍錄的寫成，倘然他有子，有助，有成，恐怕没有這吹劍錄了。没有吹劍錄，誰知道還有兪文豹其人呢？所以他說三恨，我以爲可以無恨，因爲人死留名，豹死留皮，豐於此者嗇於彼，何必不自足呢。</p>
<p>况且他說的三恨，事實上也够不上說可恨，因爲韓侂胄說過：「得官萬事足，無子一身輕。」萬一兒子不肖，貽父母羞，固然可恨，就是從乳哺到授室，要費掉許多麻煩，和辛苦，也未嘗可喜罷。至於無助，大約是没有知己朋友，從前有人說過，「得一知己，可以無憾」朋友的相助，的確是人生不可少的。不過朋友的助力以外，還有其他助力，或者超出朋友之上，像現在最有權威的大力的汲引力，就足以左右世界。兪老先生所恨的無助，不知道是不是包括這些助力一切在内。有助也容易有成了，所以他的第三種恨，和第二種恨，是相因相成的。退一步想，像兪老先生立言郵今，也算得有成了，這們一說，可知他說三恨，實在一無可恨，何恨之有！</p>
<p>貧女飛梭，一絲不掛，却是最普遍的人生觀，無論有子，有助，有成，到底還是一無所有。唯物史觀者就看得穿了，像前人說的，「今朝有酒今朝醉，明日無錢明日愁」。只有今朝，不問明日，是偉大的動念，這個動念，也是一切事業的馬達」。錢牧齋脱了靴想投水殉國，覺得太冷，就縮脚而起，素性簞食壺漿，以迎王師，他正有一個明日的觀念横亘在心裏啊。</p>
<p>今日之下，别無所恨，只有一恨，却是人同此心，便是「無錢」而已。就是有錢的，還是在恨有得不多，或者他和眞正無錢的一般抱恨終天呢。</p>
<h3>喪子</h3>
<p>— 左匀</p>
<p>「人之痛心莫過於喪子」，這話是的確的，我現在是實感到了。</p>
<p>一個好的健全的孩子，忽然的喪失了，在他的父母撫養了許多歳月，親之抱之，視同第二生命的時候消逝了，那末，做父母的是如何的心痛罷？</p>
<p>所以我祇想寫出以下的一點事實，實在我的心情正這一個大的打擊下，也歸納不起這紛亂的局面了。</p>
<p>當孩子臉色到了慘白的時候，體温也漸漸下降了，他的娘還不知道放棄挽回這小生命的企圖，盡量的在祈禱神的保佑。我見這悽慘可憐的景相，不得不告訴妻：「孩子已完了。」</p>
<p>妻纔像在大夢中醒過來，同時慘呌一聲又翻入另一個夢境，直挺挺的倒在地板上。這時的我，遍體的筋肉也軟攤了，懊惱，頽喪，悲哀，痛苦的情緒一齊襲來。經過理智一一的克制，纔將孩子的後來辦過，安慰了妻一番，就被友人帶到馬路上去散步。</p>
<p>心情的缺陷，是彌補不起的，這一刺激，已將我的心整個的淹没了。我不相信這一個健康的孩子是喪失了，以爲這是一個夢，夢醒時，我的好孩子還是存在的。誰能相信這個健康的孩子會死呢？誰能相信啊？</p>
<p>就這樣，我無論在走着坐着或是睡着，只要是寂靜的空間包圍着我一個人的時候，這一思想就襲來了：「我的孩子未死吧？」如果理智告訴我眞的事實，就一個寒噤打來窒息住這思想。不過繼起的就是心的顫動和不斷的孩子生活片斷的反映。</p>
<p>孩子死了，一切孩子的動作，都成了追念的對象。而我的孩子，他是俱備了健康和智慧，所以他的動作，是益發呌我追念，我對於喪子的痛苦，自然是加强的感受了。</p>
<p>在前，我曾勸慰過友人：「死了一個孩子算什麽呢？」如果現在有人這樣的勸慰我時，我必定給他一個强烈的反感，見得人生是必須要體騐的。</p>
<p>喪子的悲痛，我是深切的嘗過了，所以我才曉得喪子的人的痛心是没有他種慘事敵得過的。</p>
<h3>摩登對話（一）</h3>
<p>夫：假使我現在死了，你怎樣？</p>
<p>妻：那末另外去找一個丈夫。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ年一月一日</p>
<p>母：兒，今天你出去，穿昨天做的大衣去罷！</p>
<p>女：不，這不時髦了，今天是ＸＸＸＸ年咧！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>男：愛的，相信我，我是像一世愛你的。</p>
<p>女：是的，我相信，在你没有碰到比我美的女子以前。（小圖）</p>
<h3>每當新書買到手的時候</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>新衣是可愛的，因爲和舊衣畢竟是兩樣，可以於無形中添許多精神！俗話說：『人仗衣衫馬仗鞍！』雖然神駒有困阨於槽櫪之間的，但「千里馬常有，而伯樂不常有！」像那「披褐而謁，捫蝨而談。」的王猛之對符堅，以及「諸子至易衣而出，仲淹晏如也。」的范文正公蕭然物外，不修邊幅的人們，在如今能有幾人？足見新衣是普遍性而可貴的！</p>
<p>人生精神之食糧丨丨丨新書，也是如此！</p>
<p>固然，揭開書本，中中外外，不少聰敏睿智的天才者與什麽神童，然而，没有新書做導火綫，怎能燃起他們那灼耀的智識之火花，怎能開發他們那偉大的思想之燃料礦呢？</p>
<p>愛新書，買新書，我簡直成了習慣了：身邊有兩個臭銅錢，走到書店就買光了；有時候見到新書，没有錢買，總是帶着無限的悵惘歸來；但我每當新書買到手的時候：</p>
<p>（一）先隨眼光所到處，大致翻翻，看文字優美不？揷圖精美不？或印刷與裝訂結實不，美觀不？進行二度的審美，然後和代價的多少作一度乘除。</p>
<p>（二）看看目錄，大綱怎樣？細目怎樣？合起書本來默然想：這書内容有些什麽？（其實用不著閉眼睛！）猜謎子般猜想一兩遍。</p>
<p>（三）在新書的開篇，或每章的開始，先看首段，再掩起來想下面將有如何如何的理論；彷彿這本書是我的老師，正襟危坐地在口試我。</p>
<p>（四）如第三個看法，不過掉個頭，先看下段，再想上段有些什麽意思？這樣，讀半段想半段之後。初時十有九猜錯，後來也還中肯；很感覺豐富有興趣，無形中得到觀摩之益。</p>
<p>（五）有時候把一本新書看幾段，揷在書架上，簡直是：「有不得見者三十六年！」</p>
<p>以上便是我對於買到的新書的時候的待遇法；請問另外一位不相識的自學同志對於新買到的書是怎樣應付法？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十四回　酌酒傳餐狂歡含别涙　挑燈温夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>桂枝說着，收了麫飯到廚房裏去。那小煤爐子上，正放了一把水壺，壺裏叮呤作嚮，快到要開的程度，於是坐在爐子邊矮椅子上，靜等水開。半側了身子，一手撑頭，斜斜的向火苗望着。不知是何原故，一陣心酸，兩行眼涙，由粉臉上直滾下來。他向着火已是望呆了，雖是眼涙由臉腮上紛流，也不去管，只管呆望。直等那開水衝動了壺蓋，噗嗤一聲，將火苗潑着放出綠燄來，這才驚醒着，趕快擦乾了眼涙，提了開水壺向屋子裏走。一脚跨進房來，就向自强笑道：我不在這裏同你捧塲，你也唱不起來吧？自强笑道：我的戲，只好是自己唱着自己聽的。桂枝泡好了茶，將碗筷收拾清楚，挽了自强的手，同在一張椅子上坐下。笑道：我還有個新鮮小曲兒，呌勸夫改良，唱着你聽聽，好不好？自强一手托了他的手，一手拍了他的手背，笑道：好好好！你就唱起來罷。若是我有改良的地方，聽了你的話兒，我也好去改良呀。桂枝端着茶杯呷了兩口，放下茶杯，向自强微微一笑，正待張口唱了起來，忽然噹噹噹一陣鬧鐘嚮聲，由衣架的衣服裏面傳送出來。桂枝突然臉色一變，猛可的握住了自强的手，向他臉上望着。自强道：你把鬧鐘的嚮針，撥在幾點鐘上？桂枝很慘然的低聲答道：原是放在五點半鐘上的。自强站起來道：我六點鐘要走的，只能躭擱半點鐘了。去呌醒老大爺和你們老太太吧？桂枝只是握住了丈夫的手，那裏還答復得出一句話來呢？（三二二）</p>

<h3>煤油治肺病的證明（中）</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>川崎的職工，有一次飮五十克蘭姆的，也没有弊害，不過照實騐所得，第一次飮後，大概要發生腹瀉的副作用，又因分量飮得過多，也有發生喉痛聲啞的。但是這種現象，是一時的，等到停吃後，立刻會復元。尤其發生腹瀉時，據實騐者所說；反能增加食慾，清神爽氣。至於煤油的種類，不論何種都可以飮的。總以次等油爲宜，過於上等的與軋司林揮發油（汽油）絕對不可服。</p>
<p>（二）大阪市立工業研究所理學博士岩本義虎，證明煤油治肺病的效能丨他說：認識不足的人，以爲煤油有毒丨余十數年來，對於油的研究關係上，早信煤油爲治肺病最有效的藥。查煤油從幾百尺地下汲出來的，而煤油什麽的成因，還没有一定，但是都信爲動物根源說，我們分解生活於古代的魚類等屍體，消失蛋白質與含水炭素，其脂肪可分爲脂肪酸與Ｇlycerin。脂肪酸因不溶化於水，積溜在一處，所以再把其分解出來，那就變爲煤油了。如把油井鹹水分析，魚油的熱分解，煤油中含有與魚油同樣的脂肪酸。現今有從大豆油魚油製造煤油。余親手從一升魚油中分離四合五匀的煤油，這種煤油，我們日常食膳上所吃的動植物的油中亦有的。况且西伯利亞方面寒帶的人，常飮煤油。在醫療上所用的煤油朋青，是作消毒洗滌或癬疥驅蟲等用，至於内服，醫書上作爲胃的異常醱酵，慢性腸加答兒治療藥，是灌注在膠囊内服用的。（一天○·三克蘭姆至○·九克蘭姆）我們常常看見的煤油乳劑，爲殺菌殺蟲的强烈的藥，這就是煤油中加了乳化劑攪拌而成的。其煤油變爲很小的微粒子，不會妨碍植物，達到殺蟲的目的。從這樣想起來，煤油入於人體，當然没有害的，飮了煤油，使煤油中所含的强烈殺菌劑，吸收到人體的組織，循環全身。特到了體内的患部，就能够發揮其殺菌作用。再進一步而言，我們日常攝取的食物中，有脂肪與鹽類，到了胃腸内，因微妙的生理作用，形成了肥皂態，因其强烈的乳化性，把吸收困難的營養物，變爲乳劑，使從腸壁的吸收，容易起了作用。所以飮服煤油，並非單單富於滲透力，同時形成水分與乳劑，如此形成的煤油乳劑，被從消化系統的腸管所吸收，入於血液中，循環到全身。這煤油經過作用後，必在飮服者的尿中排洩，或從皮膚滲出，從這事實推想起來，煤油到了肺部，與肺的呼吸作用相伴，把患部的結核菌引起作用，爲其撲滅了。我曾經一次用百克蘭姆的煤油，連續飮服，並没有發生什麽弊害，又把知友中患肺病的，將余所信各點，詳加說明，他們也自動的飮服，其後他們都是成績良好。但余爲推廣社會上患痼疾者起見，常在新聞雜誌上宣傳，就過去一年間，直接向余詢問飮用法者達三四千人，這三四千人中，大都是患肺病的，其中大半已近第三期，余因不能逐一寫信答復，特用謄寫版，印出煤油療治肺病說明書，發送問者。現在飮服者，差不多已流行日本全國，他們得余的說明書後，如法飮服而痊愈者，可說百發百中，所以感謝余的信，如霉片樣飛來，數月前有一位醫師，向余嚴重反對，說「煤油入於衰弱的患肺病者的身體，有百害而無一利，且說醫師以外的人，鼓吹飮服煤油，是違反醫師法。」</p>

<h3>蝙蝠</h3>
<p>— 微明</p>
<p>從前有過這樣的故事：鳥和獸各合成羣打仗了，其間有種蝙蝠。鳥們勝利之後，便飛到鳥那邊去，自詡有翅子，能飛；及至獸類勝利了呢，又爬到獸類那邊去，自誇能走，牠也算獸類的。後來這二者都察覺，兩方面調和，共同將蝙蝠撲殺。丨丨這故事是在小學敎科書上，很容易尋到的。</p>
<p>這蝙蝠也可算荒唐！同時也很可笑！牠還太乏。牠至多不過看風轉舵，投入勝利了的集團中而已。牠第一：不能歌頌勝利者的功德而闡揚對方應失敗的道理。第二；牠不能想方法使鳥獸永遠鬭下去，從而獲得許多利益。第三：牠不能無偏無袒地駕乎兩者之上，當然，也獲得更多的好處而已。</p>
<p>人類爲萬物之靈，所以主意比蝙蝠要好。古人看蛇鬭而悟草書之理，甚而至於和龜類學習養生。所謂道法乎自然，人類從自然界所學來的方法實不算少。然蝙蝠却不及人們，實在應該和人們學的：譬如甲乙相打吧，可算戰爭；丙居中間，聯甲攻乙或聯乙攻甲，便可算政治：說乙或甲應該被打之理由，便可算主義。這麽許多過去了的事實便是歷史……這麽推論下去，便知道「天下事不過爾爾」。這是人們遠勝於禽獸的。</p>
<p>世界上所謂隂謀者，許多其實是「陽」謀。縱横椑闔之術在古代風行過一時，然看去並也不過爾爾。因爲無論怎樣用手腕，使心機，自處於旁觀的地位而實是主動者，是可以「隂」的；然免不了作用，旣有作用，便有事實，這便全部表現出來，不免乎「陽」。譬如站在磅秤上量體重，輕輕站了或用力站住實毫無分别，重量是一致的。因因果果縱有錯雜，然無顚倒，原形怎樣，終必顯然。蘇張雖是策士，但是古今没有覺到他們除策士之外還有什麽。卽算弄到鳥獸永遠相鬭吧，自己也不過「蝙蝠」而巳。</p>
<p>只有是這麽想，世界還有一些兒希望。無論怎樣暗無天日，眞理也仍然是眞理，光明也依舊是光明。間諜從來未曾充當過皇帝，流氓從來不曾成爲詩人。只看那班人面孔上那麽「憔悴深顰」，便可知道也還有「人性」，「良知」之類在壓迫，那是勝過地獄中的苦刑的。</p>
<h3>雪猪</h3>
<p>— 何毅天</p>
<p>西康有一種獸，短短的，不過兩尺長，毛很淺，黄黑色，很像狸，但是尾巴很短。後兩脚走路，前兩脚則捧在頸前，打拱似的。口中似乎唸唸有詞，人說牠是在唸經。常常在雪地中夾着尾巴摇頭擺腦地走來走去。一見着人，牠就鑽進地洞裏去。人呌牠做「雪猪」。牠的肚子裏面有一種油，白色，可以擦凍瘡。也許是口中唸唸有詞的緣故吧，很和平，常常打着拱無抵抗地被人從洞中抓出來讓白晃晃的刀子破開牠的肚子，嘰嘰嘰地口中又似乎唸唸有詞。</p>
<p>這東西在西康的金沙江西岸很多。不過，那地方已是英國軍官率領下的藏兵的區域了。從前在打箭鑪的時候，因爲常常生凍瘡，聽見這東西的油很效騐，我就隨時向人物色。有一回遇着一個被藏兵割去鼻子的三十九族的代表。我以爲他一定有辦法了，可是剛剛一提到金沙江西岸他就流淚抹眼。據說他們也是漢族，在西藏住了好幾代了。可是藏兵一到，便在英國軍官的指揮刀下割去了鼻子，而且逼着逃出了金沙江。我恐怕他還要說下去，抓着一個機會就問他雪猪好不好找。可是他向我摇頭，似乎表示他家已亡了，那裏還說得上雪猪！他告訴我，在藏兵的範圍内，對漢人是只許出不許進了。提到這，他臉上就表現着憤憤的顔色。眞是！所答非所問！我只好站在旁邊，從他胸前掛的銀盒裝的佛像望到他那一動一動地爛了的淺淺的鼻根。他兩眼望着天，口中又似乎唸唸有詞。</p>
<p>據說他們從前曾經是抵抗過的，也許就因爲他們常常是口中唸唸有詞吧，終於又和平地無抵抗地讓白晃晃的刀子割下他們的鼻子，像雪猪似的口中依然唸唸有詞。</p>
<p>我很自幸，幸而我不在金沙江西岸，不致於被割去鼻子；而且更自幸，以爲是生於受了科學洗禮的内地，不致於就那樣口中唸唸地讓刀子割去鼻子了。雖然多少總不無惴惴然，總以爲終會有這麽一天似的。一離開了西康我就把牠忘却。可是現在我又擔心起來了：現在許多人們不都又手弄佛珠口中唸唸有詞了麽？而且在最近期間，許多自以爲懂得科學的人們都也手弄佛珠口中唸唸有詞起來了，居然還像煞有介事地要把牠普遍的趨勢。在這所謂「國難」的期間，在這洋指揮刀到處飛舞的時候，我很擔心，割去鼻子倒不怕，怕的是在那被割的時候只能口中唸唸有詞。</p>
<p>「哀莫大於心死」！不知怎麽，我又想曱</p>
<p>起了那打着拱在雪地上走着的雪猪。</p>
<h3>蘧廬詩話</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>有明『眇詩人』謝茂秦嘗謂詩忌粗惡字，然用之在人，飾以顔色，不失爲佳句。譬諸富家廚巾，或得野蔬，以五味調和，而味自别，大異貧家矣。又謂詩中罕用血字，用則流於粗惡。李長吉白虎行云，『袞龍衣點荆卿血』。顧逋翁青竹鞭歌云，『碧鮮似染萇弘血』。二公妙於句法，不假調和，野蔬何以有味？</p>
<p>予偶爲詩，不暇辨其字面之精粗美惡，又好使用血字。嘗寄黄芝岡七言律詩一首，載於濤聲週刊，有句云，『苦語可堪和血寫，笑顔幾見帶愁嚬』。又七年前悼小說家羅黑芷，亦有『願寫文章十萬言，刳肝瀝血訴煩寃』之句。蓋黑芷嘗以某項嫌疑，陷於縲絏之中，凡月有餘日，後雖事白得釋，終以悲憤而死者也。如此使用血字，使眇詩人見之，得母謂粗惡不飾顔色，如野蔬之不假調和者乎？</p>
<p>一九二八年春，予與某君同在某藝術學院任事，彼無酒量而好飮黄酒，又無烟癮而好抽大烟，殆所謂傷心人别有懷抱者歟！一日，彼云將歸江隂，余以江隂爲前上海大學敎授周水平故鄉，周氏以某項罪名爲北洋軍閥孫傳芳所殺，吳稚暉氏爲作一文以志憤慨，所謂『恐不赤，染血成之歟』？載於語絲週刊者是也。感時傷事，爲書一絕以送某君，已具稿矣，友人見之，爲言某君遄歸娶婦，乃又毁棄。其詩云：</p>
<p>赤縣無端竟染成？逢春鳥語作哀鳴。</p>
<p>腥風血雨糢糊裏，歸弔江隂周水平！</p>
<p>倘謂文學爲發憤告哀之具，就韻文論，當推屈原杜甫吳梅村爲我國最偉大之三作家，陸游元遺山之詩猶嫌纖弱。以三公之才之性，誠有過人者，適處艱屯之會，發爲悱惻之辭，宜其夐絕千古也。明武宗時，鄭善夫爲詩規摹杜甫，頗多慷慨感喟之作，林貞恒撰福州志，病其時非天寳，地遠拾遺，爲無病而呻吟。予亦有呻吟之癖，病狀若何，尚待診斷。所可自信者，人生有涯，而予力至薄，恐未能以予之血與涙一滲於墨汁之中，而曲達於予之筆端也！</p>
<h3>悲劇的喜劇</h3>
<p>— 恃桁</p>
<p>（「醫學的勝利」。三幕喜劇。法國洛曼著。黎烈文譯。商務印書館出版。）</p>
<p>我的確不曉得怎樣稱呼這種著作才是適當的，「喜劇的悲劇」好呢，還是「悲劇的喜劇」好呢？</p>
<p>我的意思是這樣的：我們時常可以看到許多的書，那被定名爲喜劇，從表面上看來，那的確又是帶着點滑稽味，時常供給讀者們發笑的。但一切眞實的藝術絕不能以笑爲其最終的目的，在笑聲之中作者總是有意無意地暗示出一個問題，或是表現出一種現實，從藝術的目的講起來，它是與悲劇無異的。有許多年青的人或是淺薄的人，他們高高地崇拜悲劇而輕視喜劇，這是因爲他們不能够理解眞實的喜劇的原故。</p>
<p>許多喜劇，時常在嘩笑之中給了一個黯淡的收尾，比悲劇更使讀者帶走一顆沉重的心，這是眞實的抑鬱，是和悲劇的效果不同的。悲劇在一種事件的不幸的收尾裏，給人以甜蜜的回味；而喜劇則往往是從乾燥的現實裏，顯示出人類的眞實的蠢行和惡跡，那像是一面鏡子，使某一種人，時常是使多種人，照見他們一向隱藏着的醜惡。因此悲劇和喜劇的寫法也就不同了，悲劇是從詩到詩，而喜劇是從散文到詩的；雖然喜劇只在最後的一刻有着詩的抒情，那力量有時却能勝過一切悲劇所能給與的。自然，也因人的氣質不同，而對於悲劇和喜劇的見解各異，而且我也毫無輕視悲劇的心理，反之，我所愛讀的喜劇，正因爲它不單單是一個喜劇而已，那是可以稱爲「悲劇的喜劇」的。這一點是需要理解，以笑而起以笑而終，從笑裏什麽也没有告訴我們的那些喜劇，是淺薄的喜劇。</p>
<p>我曾譯過俄國偉大的喜劇家郭果爾的「兩個伊凡吵架的故事」，那故事的内容是再厭人再瑣碎没有的了，可是在收尾處，作者達到詩的最高的表現，將一切厭人的瑣碎的東西都化成感動的了。在中國也曾有過那露着滑稽的外表而且有悲痛的核心的「阿Ｑ正傳」。這些作品在讀後不給你一點麻醉的甜味，但是比什麽都更能具象着某一種的現實。最近我又看到法國洛曼作的「醫學的勝利」，而我得到了同樣的感印。</p>
<p>據譯者的介紹，志爾·洛曼（Ｊules　Ｒomains）是晚近法國十年如一日不斷努力的劇作家，而他的這代表作「醫學的勝利」更在舞臺上得到過稀有的成功，「第一次上演時，連續演了五百次，觀衆仍不少减。」這樣的收效，也許是過甚的了，然而它是有着它的成功的理由。</p>
<p>像一切的喜劇似地，「醫學的勝利」是没有什麽内容的，或者换一句話說，它的内容是不可以複述的。本書的譯者告訴我們說：這是「描寫一個不懂醫學，却懂得羣衆心理的醫生，怎樣拿着科學的招牌，威嚇羣衆，獲得成功。」這個醫生名呌克洛克。他從另外的一個醫生的手裏，買來在一個小邑裏作醫生的權利，他僱一個鼓手給他宣傳，他更說服當地的小學校長給他作醫學的宣傳，而且他還特例地創始免費診病，凡是走進他病院裏來的，没有病的也有了病；說他完全是威嚇人也有點寃枉，因爲他相信世上根本就没有健康的人，每一個人身裏都藏有微菌，而且他確是這麽相信的。說他懂得羣衆心理那就千眞萬確了，他不但懂得，他還會體貼，他很清楚有多少資産的人才能够負担怎樣的病人，他按照你負担的能力而斷定你的病的輕重。他的意思是這樣的，世上没有没病的人，有病確實應該診治，但如果你没有能力出醫藥費的話，那病也就不大要緊了。可是如果你很富有，那你的病雖然很輕，他却非「威嚇你」使你倒在床上不可。據他調查的結果，他行醫的那小邑，「全邑有着八百五十三户人家，這裏面有一千五百零二户每年眞正的收益在一萬二千佛郎以上。」而且他「有四個治療的等級。最低的等級，給那些每年收益在一萬二千至二萬佛郎之間的人們定下的，每星期只許有一次出診，每月化費五十佛郎左右的藥費。最高的等級，卽奢侈的治療，給那些每年收益在五萬佛郎以上的人們定下的，至少敎他們每星期有四次出診，每月化費三百佛郎的雜用，包括Ｘ光綫，放射能，電氣按摩，分析，普通療法等等…」（未完）</p>
<h3>瑪麗·馬奇納夫的日記（二）</h3>
<p>— 曄子譯</p>
<p>今天早晨丨丨從今天早晨起，我的心一直跳個不巳，一個男子經過我的窗前，我望見他從牧塲那邊下來，走到河邊去。天哪，他是多麽漂亮啊！他絕不像亞歷克西那麽碩大，不！他是小而壯的，壯得像昨天那株可憐的白菜。</p>
<p>他穿着一件天鵝絨的Ｖeston，帶着可以摺疊的小凳和畫架，一支烟咀和一個微笑使他的臉上生光，恰如月光照在乳白色的碗上。</p>
<p>我愛上了他麽？……我不知道……當他經過我的窗前時，我把一個玫瑰花球擲給他……但他没有注意。於是我又用肥皂和牙刷擲他……但又擲不着，他只顧走他的路。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>另一天丨丨愛情闖入我的生活來了……我又看到他！我還同他說了話！他坐在他的小凳上。他作畫。我問他的姓名。他的姓名！……想到要把這姓名寫出來時，我的心又大跳了。不……我不寫出來，我只低聲地說出來：這是鄂多·定凱斯比爾。</p>
<p>多麽美麗的姓名！</p>
<p>我又問過他：</p>
<p>「你此刻在畫什麽？是畫聖嬰耶穌麽？」</p>
<p>「不是，」他對我說：「我畫的是一頭牝牛。」</p>
<p>我仔細看去。果然是頭牝牛。於是我把眼光射到他瞳孔中去，同時說：</p>
<p>「這是我們兩人的秘密。我們不要對任何人洩漏。」</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>一星期後丨丨每天早晨，我總到牧塲上去看鄂多，我坐在他身畔，對他細說我所想的，我所讀的，我所知道的，我所感到的以及我所没有感到的一切，他用一種似乎不在聽你的態度在聽着，這態度使我心醉。我們的心靈的密合是很奇妙的。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>今天丨丨鄂多觸模我……這個記憶還使我心驚肉跳。在河邊，當我站在他旁邊的時候，我的小陽傘的邊緣觸着他的背心上的最末一粒鈕子……我忽然感到一陣灼熱的火……等明天，我要帶了鄂多去見我的爸色。</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>次日丨鄂多打了我的爸爸，他用十個盧布擲擊我的爸爸。爸爸氣壞了。他不許鄂多的脚再踏上我家的地板。從此以後，我和鄂多只能在河邊相見了。</p>

<p>昨日市塲中洋拆價格、依然白借、而劃頭市價、在小總會中做開亦不過二三分及白劃而巳、市氣之鬆濫、無以復加、拆票交易、早市轉帳額較前日加增、爲二百七十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、小總會中交易二十餘萬、銀行收解、昨日雖爲星期一、而收解亦不甚繁、外商銀行收解票欵一百五十餘萬、各種貨匯墊押什欵收解三百三十餘萬、結欵收解八十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百四十餘萬、各種貨匯税墊什欵收解四百零數萬、結欵一百四十餘萬、出倉三十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百零數萬、各種什欵收解二百四五十萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千五百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解三百四五十萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、收現二三十萬、洋押欵交易四十餘萬、鈔票進出、計收回五十餘萬、發出七十餘萬、各路來源二十萬、去胃十五萬、又票據交换所交换總數、銀元三千零四十五萬四千五百四十八元七角二分、内計銀元七百十三萬一千二百五十四元四角六分、匯劃銀元二千三百三十二萬三千二百九十四元二角六分、</p>
<h3>輔幣中僅江角上漲</h3>
<p>昨日江南小洋、早市較前日加昻五元、爲八百五十元、交易二千五百角、午市照例無市、廣東小洋、早市仍無上落、與前日同價爲七百七十元、交易六萬角、銅元勿動、仍爲三百十九千文、交易一萬一千四百元、合數額三萬六千三百六十六串文、午市各價俱停、</p>

<p>丨自行交割四一九零萬元丨</p>
<p>新高價層出不窮</p>
<p>各項均破舊紀錄</p>
<p>昨二月二十六日、爲華商證劵交易所、公債二月份期貨交割之期、是日收解數目極鉅、爲近來未有之盛况、總數計達六千一百零四萬元之鉅、内除各經紀人劃賬、歸自行交割者數爲四千一百九十萬元、在交所實行交割者、數爲一千九百十四萬元、而各經紀人塲外交割賬、尚不在内、其數雖無從稽核、但爲數必亦甚鉅、其收解數目誠可觀矣、收貨方面、以五號爲最多、其他各帮、均有零星吸進、交出方面、以金融界爲最多、至其市價經過、亦殊足述、查二月份期貨、於上年十二月三十日登塲、至二月二十二日爲止、經過雖五十餘日、但因國歷新年、及廢歷年有十餘日之休假、故實際祗四十餘日市面、查二月份期貨登塲之時、適值閩事發動之秋、故開出後卽感受影響、及後中央軍疊獲勝利、克服泰順焉、以及十九路軍放棄延平、古田攻下、不數日卽進佔福州、閩事旣迎刃而解、人心亦因之愈趨堅昻、買氣盛極一時、債市高漲未已、新高價愈出愈窮、廢歷新年紅盤開出後、漲勢盦熾、後以邇來銀根鬆濫、銀拆每日白借、投資者因斯日見增多、於是債市愈漲愈勁、及二十二日期貨停拍時、裁兵猶衝出七十元大關、竟造成七十元零一角半之新高價、打破二十二年七月十九日六十九元二角之紀錄、而鹽現亦漲至五十三元三角、其他各項亦均打破舊歳之紀錄、二月份停拍後、因價格巳登高峯、始引動一般浮多出籠、及實賣者之脱手、加以塲中傳言疊起、俏市因斯略是　疲、然一般人心思看好者仍不少、債市或不致因斯而一往下瀉也、今將二月份成交總數及交割與劃賬數、分别列表於後、（單位百元）</p>

<h3>紐約股市一致傾跌</h3>
<p>新豐洋行二十四日報告云、紐約股市、初因航空股空頭抵補尚堅、後因汽車業有罷工情勢、汽車股抛出衆多、市况遂又回低、鐵路貨運報告良好、惟鐵道股又鬆、債券低落、而以有投機性質者爲尤甚、美國公債較平、市况趨勢暫時仍難高漲、半日成交一百二十二萬股、（小麥）交易清淡、先因黑麥將徵關税之流言而漲、後因多頭獲利了結而跌、以大勢而論、猛跌時宜買進、（棉花）朋克海案之遲遲未有討論、及據謡言謂此案形式不合法律、人心因感不安、上漲時頗有賣出、目前多方似宜審愼、兹將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<h3>紗花　廠商套賣說又起　標紗散户仍傾向抛賣</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌風稍起、因實需依然沉悶、且商塲傳說、金城紗又有套賣之舉、故人心尤虚、散户仍傾向抛賣、惟某廠商心意看高、逢低吸收、不過底盤已枯、前途若何、仍依消費爲轉移、</p>
<h3>人標跌勢加甚</h3>
<p>人標前市開盤、以塲中買户不多、人氣涣散、各月跌一元三四角、午後開盤市情略好、拍至二三盤又弱、跌二三角、全日成交統計一萬九千二百包、查賣出大豐一千七百包、椿記七百包、裕康七百包、賡豐一千一百包、長豐九百包、森康六百五十包、買進泰昌六百包、源大七百五十包、仁豐一千二百包、恒昌九百五十包、大昶六百五十包、元泰六百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花市人氣軟化</h3>
<p>棉市仍疲、因美棉微落、而印棉亦軟化、且紗市又回跌、致人心衰弱、買户缺乏、現棉需要平滯、惟有一部份觀測、美棉恐無大破綻、</p>
<h3>鄭標跌三角半</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、以外棉平定、買户不多、各月跌二三角、午後形勢仍疲、各月又跌五分至一角、全日成交統計六萬七千九百担、查賣出椿記三千六百担、源興昌八千四百担、長和四千三百担、長豐二千担、大豐一千五百担、恒益一千五百担、永大一千一百担、買進大孚二千八百担、源大三千六百担、仁豐三千四百担、同和二千四百担、益豐二千五百担、恒德一千五百担、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食大粉廠亟於脱貨</h3>
<p>丨政府美麥喊價四元</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份一致呈疲落之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥微好四分、坎拿大小二角、上落無幾、故開價後、市氣尚見平定、惟各廠抛售、逐步大暢、有數大廠、以手中套貨尚多、出數甚旺、兼因現洋麥售價、亦步鬆落、政府似望亟於脱手、　價祗四元、廠家猶無進意、故各月份步落不已、迨至下午開盤業内外之多頭、以環境如斯、擯亦無益、故亦陸續了結、再以廠家之抛售、一時市塲賣氣、遂愈暢盛、價亦愈疲、據業中人之推測、以爲政府麥如果廉出無已、恐二元大關、當在目前矣、結果本月份較前週跌三分七厘半、三月份跌二分半、四五月份跌三分、六月份跌二分半、七月份跌二分二厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥出户尚不湧</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平疲之勢、洋麥報價、芝加哥好四分、坎拿大小二角左右、人心方面、依然平疲、旋以粉市步鬆、兼以政府麥之步步濫鬆、似乎前途之物價、一無看好可能、惟市塲出户、尚未大暢、故各月份形勢雖不佳、跌度則無幾也、結果四月份較前週跌五分、六月份跌五分、七月份跌三分、餘無比較、現麥市面、價呈穩勢、聞窰灣麥三元四角三分、蘇州麥三元四角二分、黄橋麥三元四角一分、固鎭麥三元三角六分、蚌埠麥三元三角四分、崑山麥三元三角、由福新去三百餘包、阜豐去二千四百包、華豐去三百包云、</p>
<h3>南北帮動辦杜米</h3>
<p>晚稻到湧跌數分</p>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源驟湧、計到六十餘號、（八千餘石）而中以　稀農多、　粳及各花色則占其半、晚稻去路、自天津等客似有進意後、今則各帮作客卽見陸續上市、南洋帮厦門客家首先出手動辦、天津等帮相隨進納、是以形勢較爲熱鬧、惟以客家吃盤從低、致售方無奈、祗得忍痛脱售、因之南北洋兩帮結果進有二千餘包、其貨均屬青角松泗西練等貨、而行情小去數分近角耳、本街店冐猶呈不景氣、銷化終覺不振、市况軟貶、如常帮蘇同帮南港等粳續見修削數分、杜洋尖則以貨乏站定、隂元忽見帮緊、變元無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮來源五十餘號、市上各貨去路轉好、市形白粳杜尖埠尖早稻價形平疲、羊秈高挺、中次修削數分、白元隂元客尖穩定、</p>
<h3>糖市隆江青貨稀看漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市公會劃盤如二四粗砂白雖仍喊十九元七角、但問津依然寥寥、轉口貨六元六角五分、成交數百包、因關金轉漲、比前升起五分、太古糖與本廠綿白價與前同、潮青祗開出高黄崗數十包、價十一元五六角、下檔隆江青申底巳罄、聞今日綏陽合生兩輪有運到千餘包、因産區價格持硬、故申市看漲、（更正前日報載卫江青十三元五角、實爲十元零五角、合亟更正）、</p>
<h3>南北貨　生晒圓肉久斷初到</h3>
<p>厦門生晒圓肉申底早罄、復以來源久缺、際斯紅盤交易、各帮多欲添辦、故市勢秀俏、昨聞太古公司臨安輪有運到一批、爲數祗有四件、大約今日可以見樣、從市勢推測、當有升漲之可能、</p>
<h3>海味　蝦米存到兩旺</h3>
<p>丨尚須看跌丨</p>
<p>蝦米金山尾因各路銷胃不動、到存兩旺、以致市售大只貨一百零五元、中只一百元左右、小只九十三四元較紅盤巳跌二三元、但仍乏受主、據業中人云、日内尚須看跌、</p>
<h3>疋頭　元直貢次貨暢銷</h3>
<p>丨呢絨業略有變動</p>
<p>元青直頁呢新貨到埠不多、而以下檔貨銷數最流利、昨寗豐行十箱之單面直貢、已爲華孚泰購去、成交價凈盤四元、該貨到喊售四元三角、查此類單面直貢與五元零次號雙面直貢、到存俱缺、頗有斷檔之慮、因匯票稍好、洋行定價激貴二三分鈿、以致無人訂定者、</p>
<p>呢絨業中有更動之訊、據聞益豐華康加股照舊、久和久大合併於久豐、又久豐裕康新昌美綸擬遷居隔壁紗布交易所西面、華成祥加股换牌號爲鴻祥、華盛同和祥改做字號、祥興清理已證實、（尚有一號聞亦將清理）福新暫移華新對面、待原址新屋落成、再行遷入、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油春盤連跌</h3>
<p>白桐油渶口洋莊交易甚稀、當春盤初開時、各洋行辦者祗數十噸而至百噸、價格加至每担二十四元六角洋規、旋漢行欲增二十五元、洋行意思因而轉淡、乃相持三四日、仍以二十四元五六角、售開百來噸、漢行開進客貨南支十九元二三角、常德貨十九元四五角、約二三千担、在漢市收盤與開盤無甚軒輊、其間雖曾一度緊俏、然交易未見、祗有一種形勢而巳、至於浙桐因開盤受漢市風傳襯托、頗見聲勢、豈知亦是一現曇花、卽風流雲散、故初盤每砠須二十一元七八角送申交貨、旋即跌二十一元二角而二十一元至二元十零七八角、且有再跌之勢連日杭行派人在申銷售、亦無多數交易、乃昨晚本埠號家接蘭溪來電已跌至十九元六角、杭州江干交貨、則至申祇有二十元、零二三角矣、各號因冬季略有存積故春盤後未曾有多數辦進、惟有某豆米行向兼營洋莊桐油、上週間曾赴浙辦成三千餘担、價格在二十元零七八角間、貨尚未到、市面巳跌、以現市而計、則損失不資也、</p>
<h3>桕油市將看小</h3>
<p>桕油本埠自春盤開後、銷塲似較往年爲清、因春盤照向例較正式市面必須稍加、所以辦者亦祇少數、蓋結帳後市情不免停頓、須待各處市面彙集、始有依據、滬上本來依據漢市、而漢市開盤、又遲早並無一定、惟近年來稍行提早、大概須視未開盤前借裝多寡爲定、據本年借裝貨漢口統市祇千餘件、銷路之清爲從來所未有、故前日巳將津市油頭盤開出、計價格在十六元左右、而荆油雖未開盤、然大略情形、巳無收盤時之聲勢、確可概見矣、本埠行家旣不向漢多借、冬底存貨亦不甚厚、且得漢市開盤疲軟消息、故售盤雖不顯露跌價、然市塲空氣、巳呈萎靡狀態、而暗中售價已未能統一、似在摇摇不定之時矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　灰絲經發現新銷路</h3>
<p>山東等省所産之灰絲經、（卽野蠶絲）爲我國天然特産、盛銷歐美各國、近受日韓之灰絲經（日本朝鮮近年來野蠶絲産日旺）及人造絲等傾銷影響、致我國灰絲經外銷一落千丈、輸出已成弩末、邇來印度方面忽發現新銷路、英輪月有數十包、裝往印度、是以英印等莊常有灰經購進、市價較前激漲二十餘元、</p>
<h3>五金　薄馬口鐵市存淺薄</h3>
<p>薄馬口鐵現貨昨市大感淺薄、客帮若漢口天津爭欲求之、而本街烟廠製罐廠印刷廠餅乾廠等亦竭力覔之、是以其底貨愈少、而市情愈俏、况來貨遥遥無期、是以市氣益爲挺秀、標凖迭見增加、計每箱爲六十元、比前猛高四五元、聞昨市開出亦有七八十箱之多、</p>

<h3>中國西部科學院派員考察各地農事</h3>
<p>考察員劉式民昨由杭抵滬</p>
<p>該川省農村大有復興希望</p>
<p>四川重慶北培中國西部科學院、爲我國規模宏大之科學研究機關、成立雖僅二年、而成績斐然、凡赴川康考察者、無不贊美該院、該院近派植物園主任兼植物部研究員劉式民、赴各地考察農事、並參觀科學研究機關、劉氏經赴烟台·萊陽·北平·天津·保定·定縣·寗波·杭州等各地考察、於昨日始由杭抵滬、寓孟淵旅舍、定日内參觀商品檢騐局、血清製造所等各機關後、數日卽將返川、昨上海社記者趨訪劉氏於旅邸、談該創立經過及最近工作如次、</p>
<h3>創立經過</h3>
<p>該院成立迄今二年、院長爲盧作季氏、其經費來源、固定的則有二十一軍及中國文化基金委員會之津貼、不固定的爲四川敎育經費收支處、民生輪船公司、川康殖邊銀行等津貼、及其他各研究機關委托代辦事業之經費、每年總計約六萬至十萬元、職員待遇並不豐裕、而頗願犧牲、其服務精神、殊爲可佩、</p>

<h3>中英擊彈第一幕李公頴大勝利</h3>
<p>昨勝包特耳四二四點</p>
<p>中華隊前途無窮希望</p>
<p>第二屆中英國際擊彈賽、昨日下午五時半在上海業餘擊彈會開始交手、中華由彈王李公頴打頭陣、大敗英國包特耳、共賽七百五十點、勝得四百二十四點之多、實予中華隊前途無窮之希望、明日下午五時半、沈林策對聶珂耳、必有一番劇戰、</p>
<h3>藝術概觀</h3>
<p>李氏戰勝包特耳、原無問題、所注意者、李氏如何發揮其本身之抱懷耳、五十槍打完七百五十點、平均每槍十五點、在以前李氏與各大强敵競賽之紀錄中、此次可謂優良之點數矣、昨日最大數額、九三、七四·六八、六五·五八·五三·五二·等、惜乎末後數槍稍現軟弱、否則平均點數、可近二十、英國包特耳、白頭老將、態度安逸、一槍在手、尚能應付、數次開騰、大有史密斯風味、限於資質、力盡而敗、巨額有四二·三九·三七·二九·二十等、平均每槍六點半强、似較平日略爲减色、</p>
<h3>競賽形勢</h3>
<p>李氏第一槍十六點、包特耳第二槍亦得十六點、互放空槍三次之後、李氏連得五八·三三兩次巨數、遂越居前導、第七槍包特耳得三九點、繼而又得二○點、比數稍爲接近、李氏得一槍意外幸運之球、接連得五二點、一次仿模史密斯戰法、得六五點、又一次敵彈巳入穴、單打紅彈亦得七四點、其最大巨數九三點之獲得、由於各種方式造成之、極饒興趣、第五十槍未完、已得四四點終局、包特耳第十槍、差七七點、第十槍至二十槍之間差一二○點、二十槍至三十槍僅差五四點、最後之二十槍、則相差頗巨、結果、共負四二四點、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>清理！倒閉！</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>問題是這樣地在面前展開着；似乎更嚴重性了！但是，那些陶醉在大都會懷抱裏的人們，還是；安逸，作樂，酒香，肉香的拼命享受，麻醉，那裏會顧到這些？</p>
<p>世界不景氣的浪潮澎湃了一時。但經過各國人民的努力掙扎，終於是好得多了。可是，却仍舊緊緊地籠罩住中國，甚至比過去還要利害。雖然，中國誰都知道是外受經濟侵略，内承戰禍影響，和其他重重的壓榨。農村經濟崩潰，商業市塲破産。民窮財盡，乾枯到了極點！然而，這班虎視耽耽的强鄰，還認中國是一塊禁臠；大家都要想染指。最近，美國正在主張提高白銀，意四是想要把他們過剩的産品拿來向吾國市塲傾銷。他們竟不看見吾國的商業已在力竭聲嘶的掙扎，結果還是倒閉，清理！</p>
<p>終年大减價，大贈送的旗幟；在每一家商店或公司門前招展着，這已象徵着吾國市塲衰落的一般鐵證。雖然，儘喊着不顧血本，空前犧牲，但是，便宜貨究竟也一樣要拿錢去换的啊！</p>
<p>在廢歷年終，法院當局曾接到被債權人聲請封門的商號有五百多家。法院當局因爲顧全大上海的市面起見，所以轉咨市商會設法調解，不料，因爲不及調解而自行倒閉宣告清理的已有二百幾十家了。這裏有；綢緞業二十多家，南貨業十多家，錢莊業十多家，其他大小商號有一百幾十家，還有，還有那將閉未閉，將倒未倒的商號，恐怕在不久的將來，也要相繼關門大吉！</p>
<p>再翻開内地各省縣的報紙來看看，其不景氣的現象；和上海竟没有二樣。僅是湖州一地而言：今年因虧蝕過巨而關門的商號也有四百餘家。杭州，蘇州………等地，各商號因不能維持現狀而宣告清理，倒閉的，均占十分之二三，少數勉强暫時掙扎的幾家，亦都在岌岌可危的狀態中。照這樣情形看來；據吾的觀察，延至今年廢歷的端節，也許還有一大批商號門上都要凖備貼起清理的通告來咧。</p>
<p>吾國的聰明的資産家，他們看見商業前途的恐怖現象，於是乎，都相率不前，視商業竟若畏途。大家都不敢投資商業，祇把金錢存進銀行，或購買證券，公債票，博取少許利息。因此，尤使一般商家要感到資金的缺乏和銀根的週轉不靈了。</p>
<p>在上海一般商店之不能維持現狀，直接受房租的壓迫，的確是一大原因，所以吾也主張，要想復興上海繁榮的市面；非要减低房租不可，减低房租是目前一樁急不容緩的要圖。它的原因最顯明的有二：（一）减低了房租，直接能使市民减輕負擔，商店的開支也因之節省。（二）間接可給一般做投資地産事業的資本家一個打擊，好讓他們少做投資地産事業的迷夢，不致使地價任意狂漲。所以，要想挽救上海的商業市塲，其先决條件是要减低房租。但是，談何容易，那些神通廣大的，頑强的，産業家，大房東，倒底是不大容易對付的。况且，减租運動會的内幕，據說：份子又非常的複雜。</p>
<p>總而言之，照這樣的下去，那麽，吾可以說：不但吾國全國的商業前途未許樂觀了。</p>
<h3>小家庭釋疑</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>在大都市裏，小家庭固已是時代的組織了。但若在内地，則還未萌芽。就是在都市裏，也還有頭腦冬烘者流喟然斥之，說小家庭組織祇不過是種學洋化的時髦病，一種自私自利的小組織，一種人類墮落的行爲，一種離背的經濟原則的卑劣主義，……由此可見，這還成爲問題，丨丨就是有人在反對它底成立。</p>
<p>我們覺得，一種組織，簡單的說，便呌它是一種事物吧，它是不是一種好的東西，或是一種壞的東西；或是一種應遭反對，還是一種不應遭着反對的東西，我們有一個條件去决定它，就是看它到底是否切合我們實際的要求。以這樣來評價它的好壞，我以爲是最好没有了。這裏我們可以來檢查檢查小家庭的究竟。從歷史上我們看到那部落時代的繁榮，看到它們的衰落，由此足見一種社會組織，或者說一種社會制度，它並不是具有一種永恒的適合性，而是一到衰老的階段便要死亡的。這，我們可以去看羅馬帝國的衰亡，如不這樣解釋，是很難找出那麽一個强大的國家竟會毁滅的原因的。在家庭組織這一點上，我們也可以發現着同樣的原因，從前那種大家庭制度，秉承氏族社會的餘緒，而發揮光大起來，一個大家庭的家長，就好像一個國家的國王，他掌管着全家的經濟大權，操持着全家人口的生死，他統治和控制着他們一切。從這種控制統馭之下，全家人員共同生産，（生産品的分配，一任家長）於是它閃爍着異常燦爛的光輝。可是社會一發展到某一階段時，組織起了變化，這時我們可以看出那大家庭的光輝，漸漸地消失了它的閃爍的色彩。農業的地位，已被工業替代了，農塲裏充斥着機器，農塲裏的工人成了過剩的閒漢，成羣的移殖到工業區去了。於是在經濟上，大家庭一方面因了離散的崩潰，一方面因生活的關係亦不再需要了。然而又並不是家庭的根本毁滅，而是需要一種，新的組織，於是小家庭這東西就在歷史的發展上必然的出現了。</p>
<p>因爲在大家庭我們知道已有幾個不能掩飾的缺陷：第一點，大家庭中生産者過少，不生産者過多：第二點，大家庭的經濟權操之於家長一人，家庭員屬卽管以全力從事生産，亦不能謀得自己及妻子的衣食的安適；第三點，因經濟貧困，兄弟妯娌間的感情，不能不對立起來；第四點，因婚姻係包辦，不能在妻子身上取得愛情，使生活發生無限苦悶。</p>
<p>所以，我們知道，這種缺陷過多的家庭組織，一定不能繼續存在，而必以小家庭來代替。所謂小家庭者，不過是别於大家庭而言，它的成員祇僅一夫一妻和所生的未成年的子女，生活在現代的社會裏，謀生的技能是須各個人具有的，因爲一個人究没有負擔幾個人生活的權力，而家庭的組織就本應是每一個家庭成員都是負有經濟的責任的，這便是小家庭的基礎。凡屬是要組織家庭的男女，他們倆一定是都成長起來，不但是成長起來，而且他們的生活都能獨自維持。再一點，他們的結合是由於愛情的，從愛的結合裏我們知道，一者可以彼此深深地認識，在生活上就能彼此得着深切的安慰；第二點，他們能夠共同艱苦，爲他們自己的幸福而奮鬥。說生産兩人都去生産，說享受兩人都同享受。没有不生産的閒員，也没有不相愛的閒人來分割他們的利益。小孩成長了，他們又成了小家庭的凖備員。這時，除了敎育之外，他們便没有再向父母的家庭廟，要求任何物質上的權利。自己不能不去找一種職業，在找得職業之後，也就另組起小家庭來了。</p>
<p>由此看來，我們知道，這小家庭是不是自私自利的小組織，學洋化的時髦病，人類的墮落行爲，和背離經濟原則的卑劣主義呢？假使不是頭腦發熱者流，當然會知這是反對者之錯誤。小家庭實是社會進化的歷程中必然會發生的一種制度，而這制度却是正合我們實際的需要，而能激發，促使我們向着進步的路上踏走的。至於這種小家庭組織是合於現代的經濟原則，則尤爲非一般人所能思及，我們知道一種組織的鞏固與否，全要着它的經濟基礎如何，能够每個成員都生産，獨自維持生活，較之大家庭的許多成員不事生産，祇賴他人生活，是當然優勝不知多少了。</p>
<h3>異國的朋友</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>夜了的霞飛路像一條虹，兩側商店里發狂似的噴着火光。</p>
<p>突然一隻手兒拍上我的望頭，當我回過頭來時，被我認識那手兒的主人是杜司基夫丨他是一個白俄，我的隣居，賣Ｅvening　Past的。</p>
<p>「上那兒去？王先生。」</p>
<p>我對他笑笑，摇摇頭，意思是表示我在無聊地閒踱着啊！</p>
<p>他用沉重的瞳子睃着我，嘴唇邊浮露着悽鬱的笑。</p>
<p>「杜司基夫，你今天没有賣報嗎？」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈，」他恣意地狂笑了起來：</p>
<p>「我今天有錢啦！我今天再不用賣報啦！」</p>
<p>他拍拍口袋，口袋里的小銀元和大銀元在鬥。</p>
<p>「你不想添一件較好的衣服嗎？杜司基夫。」</p>
<p>他怔住了，看看自己穿着破舊的貴族服裝，不知又想起了什麽，臉色隂黯起來；半晌，苦笑仍浮上他的嘴角，慢慢地摇摇頭：</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>「我不愛穿那無階級的服裝！」</p>
<p>不知那種慫恿使他興奮了起來，拉過我的肩膀，試摯地說：</p>
<p>「去！我們去醉一塲吧！」</p>
<p>描着「ＢＡＲ」的乳白色的玻璃門把我倆吞了進去；丢在門外的那條虹樣的霞飛路在發楞。</p>
<p>「三號！」杜司基夫同我佔了的張玻面座，隨口這樣地唤。</p>
<p>那被稱爲「三號」的那個白衣女郎走了過來，坐上那餘着的凳上，睃住了杜司基夫的臉！臉色是黯慘的。</p>
<p>「唉！又來了呢，杜司基夫，你今宵没有賣報嗎？」白衣女郎没有媚，没有嬌，臉是憂愁的：</p>
<p>「安娜喲！今宵！今宵我需要的不是惡毒的銀元，今宵我要來喝個醉飽！」</p>
<p>安娜端了兩盆豬排和兩杯緋色的酒精來。</p>
<p>安娜回過頭來，視綫跌在我的臉上，向我微微地點了點頭，再問杜司基夫：</p>
<p>「這位………………？」</p>
<p>「這是和我們處境一樣中國人，王先生；而且他又是一個富於情感的文人。」</p>
<p>安娜又向我點點頭，輕輕地用流利的英語問我：</p>
<p>「王先生家在那兒？」</p>
<p>「没有家。」</p>
<p>「愛人在那兒的？」</p>
<p>「没有愛人。」</p>
<p>我和杜司基夫把緋色的酒精向心頭澆灌：一杯，二杯，三杯……</p>
<p>「安娜，親愛的，」杜司基夫抬起熱度很高的臉；「再替我來一杯！」</p>
<p>安娜幾乎要哭了；捉住了杜司基夫的臂，聲音是顫動的：</p>
<p>「吾愛，停了吧！這里是銀錢堆成的空氣喲！」</p>
<p>杜司基夫的臉色猙獰起來：</p>
<p>「安娜，安娜喲！這世界上連酒精都没有我的分兒嗎？」</p>
<p>杜司基夫灑脱了安娜的手臂，眼眶里盈湧着眼淚咆哮了起來。</p>
<p>安娜只得又端了一杯來。</p>
<p>「三號！」左邊座上一個白種人這樣喊。</p>
<p>安娜站起了，免强裝了笑容，想要走過去，却被杜司基夫拖住了，囁嚅地：</p>
<p>「安娜…親愛的…」</p>
<p>安娜慘苦地笑笑：</p>
<p>「杜斯基夫！這里是銀錢堆成的空氣啊！」</p>
<p>杜司基夫望着安娜走過去，望着安娜投進那白種人的懷抱裏去。</p>
<p>他回過頭來，没有靈魂似的向我說：</p>
<p>「你眞的没有家嗎？」</p>
<p>「眞的。」</p>
<p>「你眞的没有愛人嗎？」</p>
<p>「眞的。」</p>
<p>「啊！我可不是失去了家；出賣了愛人的愛情嗎？」</p>
<p>酒杯口：「我倆乾了這杯吧！」</p>

<h3>夫婦（九）</h3>
<p>— 兪梅</p>
<p>男人抽着烟，向她望了一眼，又把兩眼凝神地注意在火頭上的斗孔處，看着黑的膏子膨脹大起來，聽着吸吸的聲音，斗孔邊的一切便都鑽進烟斗内去了。</p>
<p>從口裏吐出了最後餘賸的烟，他說，</p>
<p>「總很難講。上次倒是聽吳乾泰三老板於我們的老板說了一大堆，什麽骨賤傷龍了，什麽金子衰落了，還把帝國主義也扯上了一大堆。究竟我也不明是什麽原故。」</p>
<p>「眞是刦數到了不成麽？總不會是的吧。」</p>
<p>「很難講，說不定會是這個道理。聽見老年人說過，從前大清皇帝没有滅時，有一位眞人下凡說世界要亂三十年。還有八九年呢。眞是日子越過越難了。」</p>
<p>「我說個眞話，我們那時候做姑娘，小丫頭們那有現在這樣壞。現在都曉得講時髦，連十五六歳的小姑娘也都壞了，曉得俏皮了。還有家裏靠這個的」</p>
<p>「小姑娘們壞，我們荷包不爭氣，只好淌淌口水了。」</p>
<p>「還這樣不害臊，不用鏡子照照自己是多大年紀了。」</p>
<p>兩人快樂地笑一陣，彼此給了相當的撫愛，兩個人頭影子在帳頂上合成一個，好久才分開。男人的手却還在山上巡行，女人微闔着眼，儘男人動。</p>
<p>「三姑娘，我將來没有錢的時候，你會不會睬我？」</p>
<p>「不要講這些没津味的話。」她反眼向男人望了一下，心血跳快了一度。</p>
<p>「我早就猜出來了，你心裏會怎麽說。」他的手還在巡遊，口貼上了女人的顋。</p>
<p>「我心裏說，『我三姑娘只認人不認錢。人來儘管賒。有錢無處買。』」</p>
<p>男人高興了，在女人身上瘋狂地揉弄起來。女人向他嘴上吸了一口。低低的柔柔的糾纒不分的笑聲在燈光中晃動，蕩漾著兩個人的心。</p>
<p>得意和熱血在男人的心裏沸騰着，他說，「三姑娘，你放心，儘管我怎樣不好，我總不會忘記你的。小乖乖放好一點，我有錢時，你捨得丢了徐三跟我走嘛？」</p>
<p>「你有了錢就會把我們忘記了。還不帶了好的跑，别要哄我了。」</p>
<p>「我眞不哄你。你十五的去燒香，不要忘了替我通訴，向菩薩祝告一下，發一筆財。」</p>
<p>「你講發財呢，咳，我夜裏做過一個夢才有趣！我夢見我得了一張發財票，得了一千塊錢，奇怪的很，給你拿去了五百。後來錢又不見了。夢財失財，這夢是不是這樣解的？」</p>
<p>「說不定你今年要發財了。我今生遇見倒貼的，死也甘心了。」</p>
<p>「你死要死在我懷裏。」女人望着他，心裏忍不住笑。</p>
<p>「好，就今天晚上死吧。」男人把烟籤一摜，表示可以撤烟具了。</p>
<p>三姑娘把床上的東西都收拾了起來。她說丈夫要回家，請他走。男人却乖巧，說巳經替她在盤貨時留下一個緞布頭，正好做個襖面。她笑着說，</p>
<p>「看在你這個孝心上。」她還未說完，便笑着走到房外去把大門閂了起來。</p>
<p>把床舖好，在衣櫃邊的角落處坐下。一切在無限的安靜中，只有角落處　　　　　的聲音。男人把　子脱在桌上，已經脱了鞋登床上了。女人站了起來，把房門關好，把桌上的燈頭扭小，放下帳子，進到床裏去了。布帳裏透出來嘴唇叭叭的聲音。</p>

<h3>新年開始中好萊塢各大明星的估值（三）</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>現在米高梅的幾個明星巳經講完，要講派拉蒙的幾個明星了。派拉蒙現在最紅的明星，要算梅蕙絲（Ｍae　west）爲第一了。她豐滿的肉體，惑人的動作，先在「地獄之花」（She　DoneHim　wrong）裏，露了她的色相而使全世界的人，都要想「上西天」（Going　West）。後來又演了一張「儂本多情」（Ｉ’m　no　angel），更使一般人瘋狂了。在這個地方，除了說她在證劵市塲上的市價，巳經突飛猛進到了一個脱板的程度。但是這種現象，到底是永久的，還是一時的風尚，許多影評家竟無法加以斷定，而祇好等她再出幾張片子之後，再看吧。</p>
<p>平考斯貝（Ｂing　Crosby）是派拉蒙一九三三年的一個新發展。她的價格，在證劵市塲上每次拍板，一定會高漲一下的。他的歌舞劇，像那張「柔情曼歌」（Too　much　Harmony），已經使他在影片市塲確立了一個優勝的地位了。瑪琳黛德麗許（Ｍarlene　Dietrich），最初是以「腿」著稱的，後來又以「袴」著稱了；她雖然有了這許多很新鮮的宣傳資料，但是她的價格，在去年一年之中，巳落在水平綫下去了。最大的原因，是她所演的片子太少了，而且她的片子，總覺得是千遍一律的。從前有人拿她和嘉寳比擬過，但是現在却覺得這種比擬的太不倫不類了。不過她最近演了一張大片子，呌“The　Scarlet　Empress”，大概她恢復原有地位的時機到了。</p>
<p>還有一個大明星，在一九三三年中，已經價格慘落的，就是希佛萊（Ｍaurice　Chevaller）。這種事實，是一般製片家，影評家，所一致認定的。或者他自己亦承認這種事實，因爲他巳自動和派拉蒙取消了合同，并且宣佈他從此之後，一定要有了和他的個性作風相宜的脚本，纔拍新片子哩。最近他替米高梅公司演了一張（Ｍerry　widow），大約可以使他的證劵價格增高些。</p>
<p>派拉蒙其餘的一班明星，可以約略的說一說。雪爾維亞薛妮（Ｓylvia　Sidney），差不多巳經一落千丈了。密琳霍金絲（Ｍiriam　Hopkins），理查亞倫（Ｒicbard　Drlen），弗勒德立馬區（Ｆredric　march），都還可以保持他們的聲價，珈珞龍巴（Ｃarole　Lombarl）和賈克歐開（Ｊackoakie）都有相當的進步。加雷古柏（Ｇary　cooper），克勞黛考爾白（Ｃlaudetle　Colbert），和喬治賴甫德（George　Ｒaft）三位，去年一年之中，賣座力都有顯著的增加。馬克斯四兄弟（marxＢrothsrs）差不多還能保持他們的號召力。</p>
<p>提到狐狸公司的幾位明星，我們第一就會想起那珍妮蓋諾（Janet　Gaynor）來的。她好像永久是好萊塢的幸運兒。自從她的「七重天」（Ｓeventh　Heaven）成功之後，她就穩做了多少年美國一般影迷的偶像，直到現在，她的地位一些都没有變動過。無論她的片子，是好是壞丨許多崇拜她的人亦都承認，她有幾張片子是極糟的丨她的幾千萬影迷，總會爭前恐後擁擠着去買票看她的。所以她在影星的證劵市塲上，還是很可靠的押抵品。</p>
<p>華納巴斯脱（Ｗarner　Baxter）的地位，亦是極穩固的。他去年演的「小妹妹」（Ｐaddy　thenext　Best　Thing）和「四十二街」（４２nd　Street），又增加了他在證劵市塲上的價格。他雖然是不大宣傳的一個演員，但他在演員名單上的名字，就是製片家賬簿上的收入。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「刻骨相思」Ｔhe　Lost　Chord丨蘭心，光陸</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>毫無假借的，這是一部傷感的羅曼蒂克作品。在文學上，十八世紀最爲盛行，而在電影上到現在還遺留着這一風向。</p>
<p>大衛是一個音樂家，爲了藝術，他離開了心愛的情人，然而就在這時候，情人孟特林因屈於威勢而嫁給伯爵了。及至大衛五年後自美歸國，伯爵見大衛與孟特林擁吻，憤而與妻離婚，並携其女去西班牙。從此大衛爲了奪回愛人之愛女，而去西班牙與伯爵决鬥。伯爵死，己亦受傷，右手失去了彈鋼琴之知覺。女　兒瓊被人携之逃美，情人乃至修道院爲尼。二十年後，大衛與瓊相值，她已是舞台名優，己則爲之譜曲。他與她從此相愛，當瓊與大衛之姪因誤會而斷絕愛情之後。在結婚之前一夕，始知瓊卽孟特林之女，乃力促其與已姪結婚，己則追念情人於冥冥之中。</p>
<p>傷感的羅曼斯，常使人爲之憂傷挹鬱。在這一方面，「刻骨相思」的作者，確是相當的把握住了這一氛圍。特别是當大衛在修道院中與孟特林相遇時，那哀怨的琴聲，單調的在靜寂的空氣中繚繞，可以使人們爲之悲泣，一切均成過去，往事如烟，大衛就在傷感的情緒中挨過了悠悠的歳月。及後，由於孟特林之愛女的關係，又使他在極度興奮中重新感受悲哀，在修道院最後一曲的哀音中，我們的主人公，更使人懷着悲哀而沉重的心情走出戲院了。</p>
<p>不過，導演雖然是在處理一個悲劇，可是痛苦流離的情調並不像憂傷挹鬱的情調來得動人。我想這是應當特别提出的地方，當他寫悲哀的塲面時，常以他人的歡樂作對比。孟特林與大衛飮泣，同時寫到伯爵與莎蓮的調笑。孟特林在大衛房悲哀的等待大衛時，寫到劇塲熱烈的掌聲與喝采。大衛舉杯與瓊慶祝，引起了瓊的悲哀，同時寫到放蕩的賓客們在室外大聲歡唱等等，這些，人間悲哀歡樂本不相通的塲合，在戲劇上更見殘酷可怕。</p>
<p>此外，我們可從畫面的構圖上可指出這一影片的特點。關於修道院中的各畫面，都使人有聖潔崇高之感以外，而在伯爵家决鬥的一塲，在整個的構圖上，都是由於舞臺面類似的裝置，而使人在這古堡中發生懷古的情緒。</p>
<p>當然這一影片自有它的缺點。這不僅是說那慶功時的佈景太假，更主要的是過於簡潔，這不是剪按的經濟，而是畫面的聯絡，太簡單而只用對話以說明戲情，這種舞臺戲的作法，無疑的在電影上甚不相宜。其他從略。</p>
<h3>補評「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」　　“Ａlice　in　Wonderland”丨國泰丨</h3>
<p>— 荻茨</p>
<p>加樂爾（Ｌewis　Carrol）的著名童話「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」，搬上了銀幕。在舊歷年頭上，映于國泰，他雖然没有「唐吉訶德」，那樣轟動一時，但也有不少人給他注意。</p>
<p>我不否認兒童們，是和成人一樣，應當有精神食糧的必要；我也不否認，在兒童們的腦筋裏，有很多幻想存在；同時，他們常常把若干東西人格化。但是，無論如何，我總覺得在兒童文學的名字底下，無原則的把一切空想的故事，給兒童讀着，不依據着兒童們的幻想，給以正確的指導，是不對的。中國對于兒童文學，本來不注意的。目前許多人努力製造着兒童文學，但是，我們看到的是毒藥，多于補劑這是在看「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」時，第一個感想。</p>
<p>加樂爾，是有名的數學家。他拿數學家的資格，來寫兒童話，所以在「阿麗斯漫游奇景記」裏，首先給兒童們的就是條理和豐富的知識。這一點「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」的成爲現代人所愛讀，并不是偶然的。但是「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」到底是舊的童話，「加樂爾」有時候還是給自己的幻想和偏見迷惑着。因此，在「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」裏，只能稍微看到他一點對于現實的不滿，此處是没有多太的改革意義的。自然，人們將要替他辯解說：童話本來是暗裏組織兒童的感情的，但是，我們要注意的，就是憑籍什麽來組織？把他們組織成功怎樣的東西？所以「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」并不是目前需要的小說和影片，是没有問題的了。</p>
<p>銀幕上的「阿麗斯」和書本上的「阿麗斯」并没有多大的不同，并且許多角色的扮演，還依照着書本的揷圖。所以假使我們看了這部影片，卽使没有讀過「阿麗斯」，也没有什麽關係，因爲他用極適當的因爲是童話，導演是着眼于「趣味」上。這裏的「趣味」，并不像一班滑稽片中所有的胡鬧，卽從扮相上，動作上，巳經給我們以趣味，特别是幾個動物的斯文輕巧的舉止。頭部很多是有面具的，所以面部表情很缺少。其他是很可觀的。至少上天入地等塲面，電影更表演出他的獨特的機能。時間與空間的特殊利用，只有電影纔能做到。</p>
<p>「畫犬馬難」，因爲犬馬人皆見之「畫神怪易」，因爲神怪人皆不見，「阿麗斯漫游奇境記」的一切，我們在技術上，到底從那裏批判起呢？我們只能一般的評論。</p>
<p>（編者註：這篇文章因春假後稿件堆積直到今日纔能够發表）</p>
<h3>偶然的又一張反希片</h3>
<p>— 復西</p>
<p>德國自從國家社會黨領袖希特勒，做了總理之後，他就大刀闊斧的將國内猶太人，大加壓迫，弄得他們失業蕩産，無家可歸。那種慘酷的情形恐怕祗有身受其禍的猶太人知之罷了。本來德國自從國社主義盛行以來，外國片子，因爲難以進口，已經受了一大打擊。不意好萊塢最近又攝了一張富有反國社主義的影片，恐怕從此美國影片，更將受德國政府當局的嫉視了。那張片子，係大明星喬治亞理斯主演的，名字呌“ＴheHouse　of　Ｒotbschild”Ｒothschild是歐洲最大的猶太藉財閥，他家族設立的銀行，佈滿了歐洲各國。喬治亞理斯的片子，是描寫那大財閥與各國政府間的歷史的。其中有一段是描寫那家族在最盛時代，曾「勒令」德國普魯士邦政府，下令恢復猶太人的德國國籍。普魯士政府因爲要得一筆大借欵，於是就不是不俯從財閥的吩咐，而下令恢復全國猶太人的國籍了。這段故事，雖係歷史上的事實，但却與現在的時事吻合，好像諷刺現在的德國政府，將爲貧困而必須向猶太財閥屈膝一樣。當然，在美國方面的製片家，是竭力聲辯着，說那張片子毫無宣傳的惡意，但怎能得到德國當局的諒解呢？</p>
<h3>「中國海的怒潮」檢查通過將供映</h3>
<p>藝華公司開辦到現在，因爲它迄今還没有作品供世，所以很引起外界的猜疑？不過，我敢說這對於藝華是好現象，你要明白，人家的猜疑，就是對於本人注目，那末在别人的注目下，自然會格外努力地去從事工作了。</p>
<p>終於，岳楓導演的「中國海的怒潮」，便在這般的情形下而産生。</p>
<p>「中國海的怒潮」巳經南京電檢會通過，最近可在上海供映，片裏有深刻的表演，靈活的鏡頭，以及有趣味的小動作，大力士查瑞龍改變作風，沉着演出，確是不平凡，袁美雲的活潑，王引的激昻，更能刺激人心，實在，「中國海的怒潮」一切都不平凡。</p>
<p>當然，藝華公司是在將事實給予人們看了。</p>

<h3>電影小說　鐵血紅粉（一）</h3>
<p>— 隴耕</p>
<p>王元龍范雪朋湯傑主演　天一出品</p>
<p>動物院的老虎，出力把大塊的牛肉丨丨旅長高彦的賜予，細嚼着。</p>
<p>高彦，有的是隂險的臉，眼鏡單一片，罩上左眼，有力的眼光，在眼鏡後面射來，怪駭人地。唇上的八字鬚撇得有勁。牙，像籠裏的老虎一樣子，突出在唇外，要吃人樣子。</p>
<p>營長林振霄的妻李雪娟，帶着振霄的朋友陸元甫的妻沈氏，同時在這動物院裏遊散着。不幸得很，李雪娟那種美麗可愛的神情，讓這邊的色狂的高彦看上了，一種「佔有她」的野心，同時充滿了他的胸腔，於是，他是卑陋的向着她進取了。</p>
<p>副官馬雲標，是陸元甫的朋友，又識知李雪娟是林振霄的妻，於是，滿想佔有李雪娟的高彦，就把這「拉皮」的責任，委之於馬雲標。</p>
<p>馬雲標上陸元甫家裏，預備着把這「拉皮」的責任卸給陸元甫，陸元甫，個忠厚的人兒，他明白振霄是他的朋友，朋友的情誼上，他更是不該抹煞了良心來幹這卑陋，不道德的勾當，於是，他始終是不能允許，任憑把做会麽「官」來誘惑。但，虚榮之火燃燒了沈氏的心，「官」，那是多麽高貴，多麽堂皇的名詞，朋友算上什麽啊！終於，慾望佔了勝利，她搶着把這責任承負了。</p>
<p>李雪娟當然不明白有人在將她的身體去獵取功名，她只明白忠心來服侍她的丈夫，本來她倆的夫婦，是充滿着甜蜜歡快的朝氣的，她們只覺得可以永永偕老的就是他，丨丨當然，在他就是她，但，誰料到呢？不幸就是眼前開始了</p>
<p>沈氏敲門進來，邀雪娟上她家裏吃飯，說是有很多的親戚在等着，雪娟雖然是爲了要爲她親愛的丈夫做飯，但，丈夫振霄却爲了朋友的情誼的火熱，而贊同沈氏的話丨丨就上她家裏去。於是，雪娟去了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Fu Zhankui Sent to Dengkou to Meet Sun</h3>
<p>Pang and Others Send Another Telegram Urging Sun to Ceasefire</p>
<p>Sun's Troops' Counterattack on Ningcheng Repelled</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun, Hu Yukun, Ji Yiqiao, after meeting with He Yingqin on the evening of the 25th, decided to send a high-ranking official to Sun Dianying's defense area. The candidate has been selected and, after further discussion on the 26th, will depart on the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang and others met with He to discuss the candidate to meet Sun Dianying. Because Ji Yiqiao was ill, Fu Zhankui was finally chosen. Fu met with He this morning to discuss the main points: (1) Sun leaving the army and residing elsewhere; (2) Reorganization of Sun's troops; (3) Yang Houxiao and miscellaneous troops to be disbanded within ten days; (4) Upon completion of all matters, provisions will be issued. He intends to send Men Bingyue to accompany him, but Men declined. The candidate is still being sought. The key to resolving the Sun issue lies in sincerity. Otherwise, even if a representative is sent, results will be difficult to achieve. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun telegraphed Sun Dianying last night, informing him of Fu Zhankui's impending visit and ordering him to cease all military action from the date of receipt of the telegram. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun stated that when Sun previously led his troops to station in Chahar Province, the Anti-Japanese issue arose. After persuasion by Pang and others, Sun led his troops to western Suiyuan. This time, the westward advance led to a conflict with the Ningxia army, and the problem expanded. Due to various public and private reasons, Pang is again advising him, fully adhering to the original intent of the Branch Council, for the sake of Sun and his troops, and to preserve the overall situation in the Northwest. The Branch Council will send a high-ranking official, together with Fu Zhankui and Hu Jiesan, to Dengkou to meet Sun, ordering Sun to withdraw his troops and escorting Sun to reside elsewhere. If there are no problems, Sun's army will be downsized. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Pang Bingxun and others met with He Yingqin, He needed to consider the issue of Sun requesting the dispatch of personnel to the front. It was decided that on the morning of the 26th, Pang, Hu, Ji, and related parties would be invited for detailed discussions. It is rumored that He still hopes that Pang and others will handle the matter in a private capacity. If Sun actually leaves the army, the encirclement and suppression military operations will cease immediately. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang, Hu, Ji, and others visited He Yingqin twice last night and this morning to discuss Sun Dianying's reply telegram, requesting the dispatch of personnel to the front to supervise the issue of leaving the army. A general decision has been made. This morning, the reporter visited Pang, who said that their handling of Sun is based on the two principles of safeguarding the authority of the central government and protecting the interests of the local people. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch Council will send personnel to the front to meet with Sun Dianying, urging him to leave the army, and then plan for the post-military arrangements. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin's representative answered reporters' questions in writing this morning: (1) After Sun Dianying's reply to Pang Bingxun and others arrived in Beiping, judging from Sun's character, it seems unlikely that he will repent. It can be seen from Sun's recent active attacks on Ningxia that what he said in the telegram is probably not sincere. However, we always hope that he can be consistent in his words and actions and comply with the central government's orders as soon as possible, so as to prevent the local people from suffering for a long time. (2) The matter of Sun Dianying requesting the Military Branch Council to send personnel to the front is under consideration. (3) The negotiations with Fu Zuoyi are mostly complete. Fu will go to the front soon. (26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun decided to return to Chahar on March 1. At noon today, he had a banquet with Pang Bingxun, Yu Xuezhong, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, and more than ten others, and discussed the Sun issue. The gathering dispersed at 2:00 PM. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun Dianying replied to Pang Bingxun and others, expressing his willingness to leave the army immediately, the military authorities here decided to send Fu Zhankui, a senior staff officer of the Military Branch Council, to meet Sun and discuss post-military arrangements. Fu visited He Yingqin on the morning of the 26th to ask for instructions. The departure date has not yet been determined. Pang Bingxun and others plan to send another telegram to Sun Dianying before Fu's departure, conveying the authorities' intentions and urging him to comply with the order to leave the army as soon as possible, withdraw his troops to the designated location, and earnestly downsize his forces, so as not to betray the authorities' intention of generosity. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>The Elite of Sun's Army Almost Completely Lost</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ningxia dispatch on the 25th: Since Sun's army attacked Ningxia, it has suffered heavy losses in succession. Its spirit and elite have been almost completely lost. In the past two days, it has launched a large-scale general counterattack in a final struggle. Exhausted and depleted, they have all suffered a disastrous defeat. The army, with the arrival of Lu Fengzhang's division's three regiments, used artillery groups on the 22nd of this month to bombard the North Pagoda, Zhao Family Village, and the left and right wings of various positions north of the Ningyuan city wall, and launched several charges, all of which were repelled. On the 20th, the rebel army again fiercely bombarded with artillery groups, and the infantry advanced fiercely toward the positions of our army in the North Pagoda and Zhao Family Village area. The punitive expeditionary forces fought calmly and bravely countered, and the rebel army remained stubborn. Although repeatedly hit hard, they fought to the death, one falling and another following. The punitive expeditionary forces all boosted their spirits and continued their efforts. After more than nine hours of fierce fighting, five to six hundred enemies were killed, more than one hundred were captured, and more than two hundred rifles were seized. It is reported that Sun Dianying personally supervised the battle, and his three armored vehicles were also destroyed by the artillery of the Fifteenth Route Army. At this moment, the army has completely collapsed. Looking at the situation before and after, the enemy is exhausted and will inevitably collapse within days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch Council announced today Zhu Shaoliang's telegram on the 23rd, reporting on the battle situation: (1) The enemy north of Ningyuan has been drawing troops in recent days. At noon on the 23rd, they launched a counterattack on our front line, and bombarded our left and right wing positions with artillery groups. Several charges were repelled and they are currently in a stalemate. (2) On the evening of the 21st, a battalion of enemy infantry from Pingluo launched a night attack on the South Gate Bridge. The battle lasted until dawn before the enemy retreated. The drainage ditches dug by our army in the four corners of Pingluo have been completed. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The staff office of the Fifteenth Route Army Headquarters reported to the army's office in Nanjing on the 25th, that there was no fierce fighting near Ningyuan yesterday and today. The enemy in Pingluo has been continuously bombarding our working troops with fierce shells, injuring dozens of officers and soldiers, because Ma Binlin's brigade is digging a moat around the city. Our army continues to work. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached on Shanxi-Suiyuan Military Expenses</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi stated that an agreement had been reached with He Yingqin on the issues of military station provisions and transportation expenses for the Shanxi-Suiyuan army. The amount of funds has not been completely determined. Sun is currently in Dengkou, and Lu Fengnian's brigade of Sun's army is building solid defense works in Dengkou. The vanguard of the Shanxi-Suiyuan army is currently between Linhe and Sanshenggong. He (Fu) is expected to return to Suiyuan on the 27th or 28th. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Yang Hucheng Sends Counselor to Taiyuan</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yang Hucheng sent counselor Cao Runhua to Taiyuan to meet with Yan Xishan to coordinate joint defense between Shanxi and Shaanxi and military affairs against Sun's army. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Le Temps of Paris Discusses China's Internal and External Troubles</h3>
<p>The Influence of Puyi's Enthronement</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Temps published a long article on Chinese politics, stating in summary that since the Fujian rebellion was quelled, General Chiang Kai-shek's position has become increasingly consolidated. Le Temps also stated that the National Government hopes to consolidate the central authority in order to begin a compromise with Guangdong. From the impression we have gained, the mainland of China is now concentrating all its efforts on self-preservation, in order to see the scenes of the Ming Dynasty again. This has already been said to us by the famous Sinologist Paul Pelliot, who has just returned from the Far East. However, although there has been progress in China's internal affairs, its dependent territories are inevitably being lost. For example, Outer Mongolia was seized by the Russians even before Japan seized Manchuria, and the League of Nations did not move. Part of Inner Mongolia has been incorporated into "Manchukuo." Tibet was quietly handed over to the British by the recently deceased Dalai Lama during the Sino-Japanese War. In addition, Xinjiang is also being fought over by Britain and Russia, and they are using local tribes to compete for dominance. In fact, China has never paid attention to its outer territories. Le Temps expressed the same concerns as the Chinese government about Puyi's enthronement. Le Temps went on to comment on Japan's activities, saying that Japan's intention is not to attack Soviet Russia in order to seize Vladivostok and the Maritime Province. Its intention is to consolidate its national relations with the surrounding countries. These countries are obstacles to the outward development of Japanese power, namely, Britain, the United States, and Soviet Russia. Le Temps also said that Asia is now the most active center of international politics, and what is particularly noteworthy is Russia's policy. What will Russia's attitude be towards Japan and "Manchukuo"? It will be clear sooner or later. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Impact of Silver Price Fluctuations on the Far East Market – An Analysis</h3>
<p>Since the U.S. government actively raised silver prices and proposed to buy and store silver, the question of whether to ratify the London Eight-Nation Silver Agreement of 1933 has arisen in various sectors within our country. This newspaper has previously commented on the significance of the London Agreement and the inevitable outcome of the U.S.'s attempt to open up the Far East market. However, the extent of the impact that silver price fluctuations will have on the Far East market (including China, Japanese colonies, and various regions in Southeast Asia and India) is also a matter that requires substantial research.</p>
<p>The fluctuation of silver prices has been quite drastic in the past decade or so. Judging by the average value in 1929, the difference between the highest and lowest silver prices compared to 1920 is approximately threefold. Since then, the fall in silver prices has reached an all-time low. After President Roosevelt took office, he first concluded the London Eight-Nation Agreement and then bought domestic raw silver at a fixed price of 64.5 cents. All of these measures are aimed at reducing the supply of silver and raising its market price. It is believed that this would increase the purchasing power of 900 million people and save the world's industrial production from crisis, thus leading the world out of its current predicament. The intention is indeed good. However, with the world's silver prices declining so rapidly, we are hesitant to believe that the U.S. plan can raise them, or even restore the prosperous situation of 1920, when the price was above 80 pence per ounce, and that the purchasing power of the people in the Far East will become rich as a result.</p>
<p>The economic development of various countries and colonies in the Far East today lags far behind that of advanced European and American countries. However, this is precisely because they are wantonly implementing economic aggression, regarding colonies as the outlet for surplus goods and capital, and failing to make it their mission to promote the economic prosperity of the colonies. This is not due to different currency standards, nor is it due to the impact of falling silver prices. Taking our country as an example, silver prices were very high during the European War, and then gradually declined over the next ten years, but still averaged above 30 pence. By 1929, silver prices suddenly fell sharply, which theoretically should have stimulated trade exports, but in reality, the trade deficit increased daily. This shows that neither high nor low silver prices are sufficient to improve the welfare of the national economy. It further shows that the reason why the purchasing power of the Far East colonies cannot be raised lies with them and not with us.</p>
<p>As for the secondary impact of silver price fluctuations, it is the movement of silver in various parts of the Far East. Taking our country as an example, high silver prices make it easier for silver to flow out, as evidenced by the surplus outflow of silver in the past two years. However, it would be an exaggeration to say that this would allow all the silver in the Far East to be plundered. Judging from the past, such a phenomenon did occur during the European War, but under the current circumstances, there are likely to be appropriate methods to remedy it.</p>
<p>In short, the impact of silver price fluctuations is a matter that people in our country should pay close attention to. However, whether it brings fortune or misfortune is equally possible, and there is no fixed standard to speak of. The key lies in how the authorities carefully respond to this environment and how they make good use of it.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Border Conflicts Between Germany and Austria Cause Great Shock Throughout Europe</h3>
<p>70,000 German Troops Display Pre-War Might</p>
<p>Italy Resolves to Use Force to Maintain Austria's Independence</p>
<p>Anglo-Italian Disarmament Negotiations Deserve Close Attention</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although the local authorities here are busy denying rumors of border conflicts between Germany and Austria, dismissing them as pure fabrications, Berlin today celebrated the 14th anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party, once again displaying the might of pre-war Germany. The public gathered in the streets to watch the parade of the National Socialist stormtroopers and the National Defense Army. Their steel helmets shone in the sun as they gathered in the Lustgarten, totaling 70,000 people, and solemnly swore an oath of loyalty to Hitler, saying, "I swear loyalty to Hitler and unconditional obedience to those he appoints to command us."</p>
<p>Hitler himself went to Munich to participate in the grand ceremony. His speech was broadcast nationwide. National Socialist Party members across the country simultaneously raised their hands and shouted, "Long live Hitler!"</p>
<p>Then, a memorial service was held at the Berlin State Opera for the two million Germans who died for their country during the European War. President Hindenburg, despite his age, stood tall, along with cabinet members and others. Hitler also rushed from Munich by plane. Defense Minister General von Blomberg spoke, reiterating that Germany was not responsible for instigating the European War. The audience cheered enthusiastically. Then, Hitler appeared before the crowd, and the cheers were thunderous. After the cheering subsided, Hitler asked the crowd to shout three times, "Long live the eternally strong Germany and its leader in the Great War, General Hindenburg!" After the cheering, the crowd went to the Great War Memorial, where Hindenburg respectfully placed a wreath at the monument, commemorating the fallen soldiers. Hitler and cabinet members then reviewed the National Defense Army.</p>
<p>Now that Italy has changed its attitude towards Germany, the meeting between British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden and Italian leaders in Rome tomorrow is attracting more attention. Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich arrived in Rome tonight after visiting Austria and Hungary. Tomorrow, he will discuss everything with Sir Anthony Eden. Eden will then meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, starting discussions at 5 p.m., which should last at least two hours. The Italian Prime Minister will then host a grand banquet. Eden plans to meet with the Italian Prime Minister once more and is scheduled to return to London on Wednesday. Italian newspapers have expressed opinions, saying that a compromise based on British plans is impossible. Given the current situation, no major disarmament plan can become a reality. The best hope is to negotiate an agreement to prevent the unlimited construction of armaments in the future. Italian newspapers believe that Prime Minister Mussolini will advocate maintaining the status quo and allowing Germany to slightly increase its armaments, which is the only basis for a general agreement.</p>
<p>The authorities in Salzburg Province, Austria, have declared that they have not heard of any border conflicts. However, this news has shocked all of Europe today.</p>
<p>German-Italian relations have always been harmonious, but now they are strained due to the issue of Austrian independence. Some sources believe that this will result in the formation of a military alliance between Austria, Hungary, and Italy. The overall situation is now very tense, with rumors of both Germany and Austria deploying troops to the border.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the head of the German National Socialist Party for Austria, Habicht, made a broadcast speech stating that unless Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss agrees to actively cooperate with the Austrian National Socialist Party before February 28, the National Socialist Party will resume its activities against the Austrian government. All of Europe is now paying attention to this matter, and the Italian side has semi-officially expressed its determination to use force to protect Austria's independence. Therefore, European chancelleries are worried that the situation will develop to the extreme. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the German-Austrian Conflict</h3>
<p>Two National Socialists Enter Austria</p>
<p>Open Fire on Police and Are Arrested</p>
<p>Vienna According to a report from Innsbruck, two members of the National Socialist Party, coming from Bavaria, Germany, entered the Austrian territory of Going in Tyrol Province.

They confessed to the police chief that they belonged to the Austrian legion of the National Socialist Party and had come to Austria to assassinate a certain important figure in Austrian politics. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Vienna There were reports that a clash occurred between the National Socialists and the Austrian border guards at the German-Austrian border, and disturbances also broke out in the border town of Brno.

<h3>Austrian Military Success</h3>
<p>Christian Social Party Dissolves Voluntarily</p>
<p>Vienna According to today's government gazette, the Austrian "Christian Social Party" has voluntarily dissolved, proving the success of Austrian military power. There are no more thorns on the path to national reconstruction. Party-based Austria has become a thing of the past, so the "Christian Social Party" believes that it is responsible for voluntarily dissolving. This was announced today by the party leader, Zimak, in a speech. Therefore, Starhemberg has now become the victor in the struggle for power. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germans Advocate War</h3>
<p>Great Shock in Britain</p>
<p>(London) The English translation of Professor Banse's book "Germany, Prepare for War!" has been published today. Professor Banse is a strong advocate of German external aggression. His previous publications were well-known in Europe. This book has particularly shocked the British press, as it not only advocates invading the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Dutch colonies, but also advocates attacking Britain. It states that although Britain has always been proud and self-reliant, believing that its borders will not be invaded, it will inevitably be destroyed sooner or later. Britain has not been invaded by foreign enemies since 1066, but in the future, it will one day be ruled by foreigners. The British should also abandon their vast colonial empire, and Germans should feel great joy at the thought of this. This morning, British newspapers reprinted this excerpt, including a detailed account of the plans for invading the British Isles proposed by German theorists. The German ambassador to Britain has issued a statement saying that the author is solely responsible for the content of the book and that the German government does not endorse it. However, British newspapers say that Professor Banse holds a government position at the University of Brunswick, so the German government cannot stand aside. They also say that the German side has repeatedly tried to prevent the translation of this book from being published in Britain, initially attempting to buy the copyright of the book by suggesting it to British bookstores, but failing. They then used intimidation, saying that if Britain published this book, they would ban German bookstores from trading with their British counterparts. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3>New French Air Force</h3>

It is also said that the aircraft weighs as much as 18 tons, and its flight speed reaches 200 miles per hour. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Mont-de-Marsan French Air Force Captain Griveau and Sergeant Bernardon were each flying military aircraft for practice when they accidentally collided in the air and fell from a height of 800 meters. Both were killed. The wreckage landed about two kilometers apart. The violence of the collision can be imagined. Aviation Minister Trant General went to investigate the cause of the accident after hearing the news. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Czech Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>Everything Focuses on the Little Entente</p>
<p>Prague It has been rumored that the Berlin government has suggested to Czechoslovakia that, following the precedent of the Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact, Germany and Czechoslovakia should conclude a similar treaty. The Lidové Noviny has denied this. The newspaper's tone represents the views of the Czech political circles, saying, "Germany intends to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Czechoslovakia under certain conditions, which can be seen from several signs. However, Czechoslovakia has a clear understanding of this matter, which is well known. Czechoslovakia will not conclude any agreement with other countries without first seeking the consent of the Little Entente countries and France. Any agreement signed by Czechoslovakia must also be in line with the general policies of the League of Nations. This is the fundamental concept of Czechoslovakia's foreign policy, which has not changed even after recent months of international negotiations." At the end of January this year, there were rumors of this matter in Germany, and some said that this proposal was made by Czechoslovakia to Germany. At that time, Czech officials stated that Czechoslovakia had never made such a proposal, and Germany had informally sounded out Czechoslovakia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this matter. This was detailed in our telegram of January 31. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Britain Builds Ten Cruisers</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Be Completed in Two Years</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express reports that the funds for the first batch of ten new cruisers to be added to the British Navy will be included in the new budget. These new ships are not expected to be ordered before February next year and are scheduled to be completed in two years, so they will not be bound by the London Naval Treaty, which expires in December 1936.

<h3>Rumors of a British Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Sir John Simon Highly Touted as Foreign Secretary</p>
<p>(London) There are rumors that the British cabinet will be reshuffled, with Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon to be reassigned as Home Secretary. Sir John Simon officially denied this today. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the news of a cabinet reshuffle has been denied by various parties, newspapers continue to report on it. Many newspapers say that even if the cabinet reshuffle is not imminent, it will at least take place soon. In short, a reshuffle is indeed possible. Of particular note is that several newspapers that are usually opposed to the government, such as the Daily Mail, Morning Post, and Daily Express, have said that if Sir John Simon leaves the position of Foreign Secretary, Prime Minister MacDonald and Lord President of the Council Baldwin seem to favor Lord Halifax, the Minister of Education and Chancellor of Oxford University. Halifax is a member of the Conservative Party, formerly Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin, and was later ennobled, hence his current name. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>The United States Considers Abandoning Philippine Naval Base</h3>
<p>No Decision Before the Naval Conference</p>
<p>Philippine Independence Must Be Guaranteed by All Countries</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a well-placed source here today, the U.S. Navy Department, in view of the imminent independence of the Philippines, is now considering abandoning its plans to build a naval base in the Philippine Islands. According to well-informed sources, once the Philippines is independent, the United States must strengthen its base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as it will be its only naval base in the Pacific at that time. The recent flight of six U.S. Navy aircraft from San Francisco to Honolulu, a distance of 2,098 miles, is related to this matter. However, the U.S. decision to abandon the Philippine naval base will not be formally decided before the Washington Naval Conference next year. It is reported that at that time, the United States will do its best to have the participating countries guarantee the independence of the Philippines. Also, there will be a compromise amendment to the Hawes-Cutting Act, which advocates Philippine independence. President Roosevelt and Philippine Senate President Quezon have agreed on this amendment after consultations. If this proposal can be passed during this session of Congress, the Philippine authorities can decide on the early realization of independence based on the public reaction in the parliamentary elections in June this year.

<h3>U.S. Commercial Policy</h3>
<p>Round Table Conference Held at the White House</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Secretary of State Hull today, President Roosevelt's commercial advisors cannot agree with each other. Hull said that the White House has convened a meeting to reconcile their opinions and establish a practical and far-reaching commercial policy. This meeting is in the form of a round table discussion and should result in a broader commercial policy being agreed upon. The main purpose is to find ways to increase U.S. exports. The meeting will also consider asking Congress to authorize negotiations on reciprocal tariff agreements and will pay particular attention to the issue of war debts. It is generally felt that the tariff issue is now gradually reaching the point where it must be decided whether existing prices can be maintained without stimulants. Therefore, the financial community and politicians do not regard the White House's convening of the meeting as unusual. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<h3>British Unemployment Demonstration</h3>
<p>Oppose the Government's Unemployment Bill</p>
<p>Establish a Socialist Republic</p>
<p>(London) Today, unemployed workers held a rally in Hyde Park to oppose the government's unemployment bill. A team of police was on guard in the park. The meeting proceeded in an orderly manner. Prominent members of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party gave speeches to the demonstrators in eight different locations. After listening to the speeches, the crowd dispersed. A man named Hannington, the leader of the so-called National Unemployed Workers' Movement, declared to the crowd that they planned to promote a general strike, with the ultimate goal of establishing a labor socialist republic in Britain. Some of the demonstrators came to London from Scotland, Lancashire, Wales, and other rural areas. They opposed the unemployment bill, especially the provision that anyone receiving government relief must prove that they have no other sources of income. The authorities had carefully arranged to maintain order. Twelve thousand police officers and four thousand special police officers escorted the so-called hunger marches from all over the country to Hyde Park. There were about two thousand people in the so-called hunger march in the park, and there were four thousand police officers, including two hundred mounted police. Several thousand people sympathetic to the demonstrators and curious onlookers came to the park to watch, including many women and children. Students of Oxford and other universities with "red" leanings also went to the park. After hearing speeches criticizing the government and attacking the unemployment bill, the demonstrators' spirits waned when it suddenly rained, and they returned to their residences under police escort. The demonstrators received various conveniences in terms of food on their way to London, and sympathizers often treated them kindly. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The hunger marchers in Hyde Park held a demonstration. The order was excellent. At noon, three or four hundred demonstrators formed a team, holding red flags and singing the Internationale, marching towards Hyde Park. The police were on both sides to monitor them. Each team leader held signs, such as "In 1914, the country needed us to serve on the battlefield, in 1934 the country watched us starve to death" and "We demand bread, not cruisers." The hunger marchers from western Scotland (the Prime Minister MacDonald's hometown) carried a huge billboard depicting Prime Minister MacDonald as the "Loch Ness Monster," with the words "Scottish miners attack the monster in Westminster." The demonstrators reached the center of the park and stood around a temporary podium. Many people gave speeches, including two or three lower house members of the extreme left-wing Socialist Party. At 5 p.m., the demonstrators reorganized, with music leading the way and flags flying, marching towards various districts of the city. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday afternoon, the hunger marchers held a demonstration in Hyde Park. Although the various workers' groups announced the end of the demonstration at 5 p.m., many people were still listening to speeches near the park in the evening. The last speakers were mostly temporary speakers, the most noteworthy of whom were a twelve-year-old boy representing the children of unemployed workers and a man who claimed to be a black leader. The two spoke eloquently, and the listeners were very interested and reluctant to leave. As a result of the demonstration, only three people were arrested for insulting the police. Although the demonstration was ostensibly a protest against the unemployment relief bill, it was actually more important and broader in scope. This can be seen from the fact that, in addition to the leaders of the Independent Labour Party, there were also many famous figures from the Labour Party, such as Ms. Wilkinson, a member of the last House of Commons. The speeches mostly focused on the establishment of a unified front to develop the British labor movement. Hannington, the leader of the Communist Party, said, "Our goal is to organize a national general strike movement to establish a labor socialist republic." (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>Saito's Response to Questions in the House of Peers</h3>
<p>Strict Control of Right-Wing Violent Actions</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers Budget Committee convened at 10:00 AM on the 26th. Kobayashi Kiheiji of the Dowakai questioned Minister of Education Hatoyama regarding education issues. Subsequently, Matsumura Giichi questioned Prime Minister Saito about security matters. The Prime Minister responded, stating,</p>
<p>The government must strictly control violent behavior. While it is difficult to control the ideology of right-wing factions, their violence must be suppressed.</p>
<p>In response to a question from Sakamoto Toshiatsu, he replied,</p>
<p>The government has not yet decided whether to establish a new agency for fuel issues. As for establishing a national defense conference, the Resources Investigation Committee is currently investigating it.</p>
<p>Matsumura Giichi further questioned the Prime Minister, saying,</p>
<p>The Prime Minister says he will not control right-wing ideology, but among the right-wing are those who attempt to radically change the social structure. Will the government continue to allow this?</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied,</p>
<p>It cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>Next, Baron Iwakura questioned,</p>
<p>The current Manchurian institutions are transitional, so talent and capital do not flow to Manchuria. The government has no fundamental investigation into Manchurian economic work. Under the current system, satisfactory development of Manchuria cannot be expected.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied,</p>
<p>Currently, due to the transitional period, affairs are being conducted with a tripartite system. The system will gradually change in the future. Next, Count Niara spoke about national ideology and then said,</p>
<p>We should make the world recognize "Manchukuo." To this end, please support the government's efforts to have "Manchukuo" participate in the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>Minister of Education Hatoyama replied,</p>
<p>The issue of "Manchukuo" participating in the Far Eastern Games has been agreed to by the Philippines. However, China has not recognized it. Efforts will be made in the future to have "Manchukuo" attend the Games.</p>
<p>Finally, after Matsumura's questioning, the meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM. (Jiji News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At around 2:00 PM today, a large man suddenly broke into the Ministry of Education, threatening Minister of Education Hatoyama to resign.

The violent man's name is Moriyama Goro, 30 years old, and he is said to be a member of a right-leaning group. (Jiji News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Internal Strife Within the Seiyukai Subsides</h3>
<p>Mochizuki's Resignation Scene Takes Effect</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Within the Seiyukai, there has always been opposition to President Suzuki and Minister of Education Hatoyama, especially the dissatisfaction of the Kuhara and Tokonami factions. Therefore, there were often secret struggles within the party, carrying out various maneuvers. When Mr. Tokonami's speech at the beginning of this session of the Diet was welcomed by the political world, the members of that faction took the opportunity to attempt a grand alliance, oppose President Suzuki, and plot to unite the members of the Sei, Min, and Koku Do three parties to form a "Unified Club" with Tokonami as chairman, beginning a non-partisan political movement. Within the Seiyukai, they were then divided into a grand alliance faction and its opposition. The struggle gradually intensified, and some members took advantage of this atmosphere to plan and create a fascist atmosphere, and there were those who attempted to create a Hiranuma Cabinet or a Yamamoto Cabinet. When Kazumi Okamoto exposed the disciplinary issues of Minister of Education Hatoyama and Minister of Railways Mitsuchi, this internal strife became more intense, leading to the danger of the Seiyukai splitting. Party elder Keisuke Mochizuki, who had previously been in contact with the Kuhara and Tokonami factions and expressed goodwill towards the grand alliance movement, suddenly declared that he would take full responsibility and proceed with resignation procedures. The Seiyukai was very embarrassed by Mochizuki's resignation, as he was an important figure in the party headquarters, and his resignation had a major impact on the political world. Executives and other important figures tried hard to persuade him to stay, and he then dispelled his intention to resign. At this point, the internal strife of the Seiyukai, apart from the issue of the reinstatement of party members Tsugumo and Nishikata, has reached a happy conclusion. The grand drama of Mochizuki's resignation has also come to an end. (Jiji News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3>Central Government Plans to Establish a Silver Price Research Association</h3>
<p>Engaging Domestic Economic Experts</p>
<p>Researching the Issue of Stabilizing Silver Prices</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government believes that the US's issue of raising silver prices is of great importance and plans to order the Economic Council, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and other relevant departments to engage domestic economic experts to organize a Central Silver Price Research Association to study countermeasures. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry's Silver Price Issue Research Committee held its first meeting on the 26th to exchange views. Concrete results will be presented to the central government for reference. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Peng Xuepei, Director of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Department, said that the government had already begun researching the issue of the US raising silver prices before receiving a telegram from the Shanghai banking community, planning for a rainy day. Measures will be taken once the US implements its policy, but all methods, such as banning silver exports, are still under study.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Economist Liu Zhendong said that the US's plan to raise silver prices has caused domestic panic, similar to the phenomenon of gold prices soaring and silver prices plummeting several years ago. However, the impact of cheap silver several years ago did not harm the country's wealth and purchasing power. Only international trade was disrupted due to different exchange rates. The US's current plan to raise silver prices aims to dump US goods on other countries, but this method will not last. If there is unlimited minting of silver coins, it will cause silver prices to fall. As a silver-using country, China is now in a passive position. The only way is to stabilize domestic currency prices, maintain commodity prices, and implement the collection of silver export taxes or a ban on exports. (China Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Chengbo, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, said that the Executive Yuan had already studied the issue of soaring silver prices before receiving a telegram from the Shanghai banking community. The Ministry will pay attention to the impact of high silver prices on industry. Minister Chen has also engaged experts to discuss fundamental and short-term solutions. The result of high silver prices will inevitably be lower commodity prices, and various industries will inevitably collapse. The financial community will also panic due to debt difficulties. Farmers will suffer quickly and obviously, and workers will suffer unemployment. The approval of the silver agreement has no absolute relationship with this issue. The fundamental purpose of the agreement is to reduce silver price fluctuations, not to raise silver prices. If the government believes it can approve it, it should attach reservations, stating that if there is a violation of the spirit of the agreement, seeking to raise silver prices, we have the right to act freely. Furthermore, the US's silver policy has not yet been clearly announced. If it proves to be actively raising silver prices, then the fundamental purpose of the agreement has been lost. The government may simply not approve it for this reason. (China Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3>Reports from Central Government and National Government Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Tan Zhen: National Salvation Issues</p>
<p>Zeng Kuangqing: Party Affairs in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 119th Memorial Week on the 26th. Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Li Zonghuang, Fang Juehui, Hong Ludong, Li Ciwen, Zeng Kuangqing, Miao Peicheng, Xie Zuomin, Zheng Zhannan, and about 500 staff members attended. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting. Zeng Kuangqing reported, saying that the Party affairs in Sichuan Province were unable to fulfill the responsibility of leading the people because the past leaders had extremely inconsistent opinions and frequent disputes. Since the Central Government sent him as a special commissioner for Party affairs to Sichuan to preside over the matter, he repeatedly explained the importance of sincerity to his comrades in order to eliminate differences and unite sincerely to achieve the effect of unifying Party affairs. Currently, the former leaders are all working hard under the leadership of the special commissioner, and the results are good. In addition, the military in Sichuan Province used to have soldiers who each possessed huge armies and competed for defense areas, resulting in the number of troops in the province reaching more than 500,000. The disputes and looting led to a daily increase in exorbitant taxes, which the people could not bear. Since the communist bandit Xu Xiangqian infiltrated Sichuan and disturbed the Tongba and Sui areas, the military in Sichuan Province has been deeply stimulated and can eliminate the old conflicting opinions and unanimously advance to suppress the red bandits. The local defense militias have also realized that the bandit threat is worrying and do not compromise on territory, cooperating in eliminating bandits. Future success will surely be achieved. Sichuan Province is a wealthy area. When foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent and national defense is not solid, the nation's economic center of gravity may be shifted from Shanghai and Tianjin to Sichuan Province, to serve as the basis for long-term resistance to prolong the survival of the nation. He hoped that all comrades would pay attention to it. The meeting adjourned after 10:00 AM. (China Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 10:00 AM on the 26th. Zhang Ji, Tan Zhen, Niu Yongjian, Zhu Peide, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Chen Xunyong, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Lin Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 400 National Government staff attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Tan Zhen's report, entitled The Fundamental Problems of Saving China, first described the decline of our nation, the decline of its spirit, and the increasing disaster and famine, which have led to an increase in the death rate. The current population is less than 400 million. Therefore, saving the country today means saving the nation and improving the race. He then said that the crisis of 1936 is imminent. Observing the governance of Mussolini and the policies of Hitler after taking power in Germany, they all focus on encouraging reproduction and promoting eugenics. With the danger urgent, we should exhaust the power of the government and society to engage in the plan to preserve the race and save the country, learn from the legacy of King Yue's ten years of growth and ten years of teaching, to build a young China and avoid elimination.

<h3>Legislator Shi Shangkuan Reprimanded</h3>

The court attached the original letters and telegrams to the file, which was discovered by lawyer Shen Nancheng when reviewing the file. Citizens such as Liu Jinghan from the county then accused the Supervisory Yuan. Supervisory Committee members Gao Youtang and others believed that Shi's private letters were entreating and interfering in the lawsuit, considering it dereliction of duty, and filed an impeachment. The Supervisory Yuan submitted the case to the National Government, which referred it to the Political Affairs Officials Disciplinary Committee for punishment. After review by committee members Ye Chucang, Huang Fusheng, and Zhang Ji, they determined that Shi's actions constituted a violation of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Service Disciplinary Law, and decided to issue a reprimand in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the same law.

<h3>Confirmation of US and Germany Acknowledging the Puppet Organization is Incorrect</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A news agency recently telegraphed that due to rumors that a certain European country was about to recognize the "puppet Manchukuo," the US did not want to hastily implement the statement by former Secretary of State Stimson that it would not recognize countries created by violence or aggression.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, based on telegrams from the chambers of commerce in Shanghai, Ningbo, Changsha, and other places, reported that rice prices in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces have plummeted.

<p>The tranquility of Paris, its prosperity, and its comfort are universally known and praised. Although recent political unrest has been unpleasant, the changes in the cabinet have been limited to the replacement of government officials and have not had a major impact on France's future or its foreign policy. However, a relatively serious event has recently occurred.</p>

<p>It is the imbalance of the budget and the inadequacy of national treasury revenue that has aroused extreme resentment among the general public. From the extreme right to the extreme left, all are filled with resentment and want to break the current situation and create a new one, but it is always not easy to get an opportunity to incite the masses. This time, it happened to encounter the pawnshop operated by the Bayonne Municipal Government issuing improper municipal bonds, which further aroused public resentment and involved members of the Xu Dan cabinet and the former police chief. Thus, the citizens unanimously resented and, upon the call of the right-wing, formed a majority of the masses. This matter began in late January and became more active in early February. Although the French government tried to maintain calm, the Royalist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party all worked hard to instigate. On the afternoon of February 6, a major riot broke out. Demonstrators, holding stones and wooden sticks, broke through the police line on the Concorde Bridge and surrounded the parliament. The number of people and police officers injured at that time, according to unofficial investigations, was more than four hundred, and the number of deaths was twelve. It has not subsided until this morning.</p>
<p>Now, let's put aside the situation of the riot for the time being and report the process that led to this riot. What exactly is the illegal event of the Bayonne Municipal Pawnshop? It is still not easy for us to make an immediate judgment, but it has been investigated by the police department and the Ministry of Interior. It is said that the number of these illegal bonds issued is about four to five hundred million francs. The issuer of these bonds is the head of the pawnshop, Texie. Under normal circumstances, to issue bonds, one must register with the government. These four to five hundred million francs of bonds were all issued by Texie privately, without government registration.</p>
<p>The process of its discovery was that one of the investors, the Erpen Insurance Company, requested repayment of the matured bonds, but received no response. Therefore, it was discovered by the government immediately. Texie was arrested immediately. The time of his arrest was December 25th of last year. After several studies, it was learned that the initiator of this illegal event was not Texie, but another reputable person. This person is called Alexandre Stavisky.</p>
<p>Stavisky is the central figure who aroused this riot. Perhaps people in our country do not understand him very well, so I will give a brief introduction. Stavisky is a Russian-Greek. His father was a dentist. He only entered French citizenship before the war. He is a very intelligent person. He is a repeat offender of fraud and scams. In France, he became famous in 1926. His main business is as a business initiator. Real estate companies, gemstone companies, elevated railways, subway roads, etc. are all his targets. In 1926, the reason why he suddenly became famous was the same as this time, it was the issuance of illegal bonds by the Alain Public Pawnshop, but because the evidence was insufficient, he was released. Therefore, the general French society knows that he is a great swindler. From that time on, the business he initiated expanded to the international level, especially in Hungary, he bought frozen bonds to use as a tool to manipulate the market. In Paris, he operated several theaters, and the "Vioronto" new newspaper was under his control. His speculation is very rich. When gambling, he does not change his face even if he spends millions. The big fraud case of 1926 gradually disappeared into the darkness, and he became prosperous day by day in inverse proportion to the darkness. His reputation was getting better and better day by day. His footprints were everywhere in the Parisian social circles.</p>
<p>In this case of illegal issuance of bonds, after Texie was arrested, he was also summoned for questioning, but he was released again due to insufficient evidence. However, since the day he was released, his shadow has no longer been seen in the Parisian social scene. This has caused the Parisian citizens, especially the masses under the right-wing parties, to become more suspicious. They thought that he was the initiator of the Bayonne Municipal Pawnshop, and Texie was his friend, so he was the core figure in the scam. There is no need for any more evidence. This problem has gradually become serious, even affecting the Xu Dan cabinet. Unexpectedly, the news of Stavisky's suicide was announced on January 9, and the problem was temporarily simplified, and the Xu Dan cabinet was able to survive. However, Stavisky's suicide is still hidden in the dark curtain. The right-wing "Paris Echo" and the socialist newspaper "People" all expressed suspicion and attacked the government. Xu Dan finally could not support it. It is also a question what Daradi will do after he comes to power. The masses in Paris are singing the Marseillaise everywhere, chanting the slogans "Down with the government" and "Put the former police chief Shabai in jail." Demonstrations and demonstrations are all over Paris. Yesterday's prosperity suddenly turned into terror today. What will happen in the future, I really dare not judge lightly.

<h3>Difficulties After the Re-taking of Yuguan</h3>
<p>Puppet Organs Show No Intention of Withdrawing</p>
<p>Our Police Still Wear Puppet Uniforms</p>
<p>Japan Refuses to Return the Sixteen Passes of the Great Wall</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, It has been half a month since Yuguan was retaken on February 10. Tao Shangming and Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, have come to Tianjin to report. According to them, after retaking Yuguan, the political situation is good, and the officers of both sides are getting along well, but the various puppet organs have not yet withdrawn. After Tao Shangming visited Yu Xuezhong, the Chairman of Hebei Province, in Tianjin, he went to Pingjin to request instructions from the Military Branch Council and the Political Affairs Committee on the re-taking of the various passes of the Great Wall. He can return to Tianjin and then return to Yuguan in the next few days. It is reported that Tao and others are conducting negotiations with the Japanese on two matters: one is the withdrawal of the puppet Japanese organs, and the other is the re-taking of the various passes of the Great Wall. The puppet Japanese organs that have not yet withdrawn at present include the Japanese Military Police Detachment, the Headquarters of the Kawakai Garrison, the Japanese Police Station, the Puppet Border Police Force, the Suixing Tax Branch, the Puppet Border Passport Verification Office, the Puppet Shanhaiguan Telegraph Bureau, the Puppet Shanhaiguan Post Office, and the Puppet Shanhaiguan Customs, and more than ten other organs. Among them, the Puppet Post Office occupies our Telegraph Bureau's building, making it impossible for our Telegraph Bureau to resume operations. The Puppet Border Police Force exercises its authority at the station, and there are also many conflicts with the authority of our Beining Railway and the Shanhaiguan Special Public Security Bureau. Therefore, Tao Shangming will ask the Japanese representative Igi to demand that they must withdraw. After the establishment of our Special Public Security Bureau, the police have been staffed to one hundred and twenty, including fifty recruited during the maintenance association era. Within one to two months, another eighty will be recruited, for a total of two hundred. Previously, the Japanese did not allow our police to carry firearms, but after Su Yuqi repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese, they allowed fifty of them to be equipped with handguns and short knives, but absolutely did not allow them to be equipped with rifles. Su believed that only fifty out of two hundred police officers were allowed to be equipped with guns and knives, the number was too small to maintain ground security, and he has asked Tao Shangming to relay to the Japanese side that it is still necessary for each person to be equipped with guns and knives. Due to financial reasons, the police uniforms of the police officers under the management of the maintenance association still wear the puppet national police uniforms. They must be changed when wearing jackets after the spring warms up. At present, only the five-pointed star emblem of the puppet country on the hat flower has been removed and replaced with our Jiahe. The general members of the local maintenance association have always opposed the authorities taking over the regime. Because of this, they must nag the Japanese in front of the Japanese, attacking Su Yuqi and Yuan Tai, and plan to move to revive the puppet organization. Some Japanese ruffians and the Japanese military police team enter and exit the public security bureau and the county government all day long, investigating our measures. Although Su Yuqi and Yuan Tai are overwhelmed by it, they have no way to refuse. Japan has some regrets about handing over a part of the regime. The puppet Japanese organs in Yuguan have expressed that they will never withdraw. It is also difficult to negotiate how Tao Shangming will negotiate in the future. Within the Luanyu Administrative Region, the sixteen Great Wall passes of all sizes designated by the Political Consolidation Council to be taken over by Tao Shangming include Panjiakou, Lengkou, Jiunmenkou, Yiyuan Kou, and Jielingkou. At these five major passes, the Japanese built barracks last year. Recently, they informally expressed to our side that the bandit atmosphere on the Great Wall Line is not peaceful. In order to ensure the safety of Manchuria, they will not return it for the time being. The small passes can be taken over by our side. In fact, no Japanese troops are stationed at the small passes, and there is no need to take them over. In order to prevent Japanese puppet troops from crossing the border and invading, our side must reorganize the defenses of the small passes, send armed security teams, and set up long-distance military telephones. However, this seems unnecessary at this time, and I am afraid that the Japanese side may not agree to our reorganization. Therefore, Tao Shangming's purpose in going to Yuguan this time is still to negotiate for the simultaneous takeover on the 16th. (24th)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Re-deploys Border Defense</h3>
<p>Slight Changes in the Guangdong Army's Fujian-Jiangxi Front</p>
<p>Continued Construction of Defense Works in Southern Fujian</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Since the end of the Fujian Incident, the large armies in various places will jointly encircle and suppress the Jiangxi bandits. The Guangdong army troops stationed in western Fujian and southern Jiangxi have also re-deployed their front lines. It is reported that the First Column has decided to use the entire First Army to take on the task of attacking the bandit nests, while the security of southern Jiangxi will be handed over to Zhang Da's Fourth Division and the Gui army's Wang Division to defend. The First Army Headquarters issued an order yesterday to Li Zhenqiu's First Division, which is stationed in Ganzhou and Nankang, to transfer to Anyuan. Ye Zhao's Second Division, originally stationed in Anyuan, will be transferred to Xinfeng. The Wang Division will return to San'nan, and the Zhang Division will return to Nankang and Ganzhou. The transfer must be completed within this month. On the Fujian border, due to the outbreak of the Fujian War, the Guangdong army gathered in the southwest of the Fujian border. Now that the situation in Fujian is settled, the defense of that area has also been re-deployed. In the future, with the development of the anti-communist military, it is planned that Huang Yanzhen's Seventh Division and Huang Zhiwen's Eighth Division of the Third Army of the Second Column will attack Junmenling from Xunwu and other places nearby, and cooperate with the First Column to jointly attack the bandit areas of Huichang and Ruijin. Chen Zhang's Independent Second Brigade is currently stationed in Wuping, Shuitang, Jiaoling, and Yanqian. Recently, the brigade has also reorganized a regiment of scattered soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army that it has taken in, and is temporarily stationed in Shanghang. The entire Independent Second Brigade will be responsible for liaison and coordination with the First and Second Columns. As for Huang Renhuan's Independent First Division, it will return to its original defense area. Deng Longguang's Independent Fourth Division will return to Huizhou, Heyuan, Boluo, and Zijin to continue handling the pacification affairs of the five counties. As for Li Zhenliang's Fifth Division, after the Independent First Division returns to the Guangdong border, it will also return to Meixian, Dapu, and Xingning to serve as the reserve force for the anti-communist army on the Fujian border. Recently, Huang Hechun's unit, which has reorganized Cai Tingkai's remnants into the Independent Third Brigade in Longyan, will be transferred back to Dongjiang for training. In the future, the defense of southwestern Fujian will be entirely the responsibility of Huang Renhuan's Independent First Division. For the administration of the area, Chen Jitang intends to follow the example of southern Jiangxi and set up a Southern Fujian Administrative Commissioner's Office to preside over all administrative construction matters in southern Fujian. He has recently sought the opinions of the central government and recommended Wen Chongyuan, the secretary of the General Headquarters, as the Southern Fujian Political Affairs Commissioner. Also, in order to protect the security of southern Fujian, the defense forces have recently continued to construct defense works in southern Fujian. The Independent First Division has received a large number of hoes, shovels, axes, and other tools to speed up the work. All the positions and defense works in Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding must be completed before March 15. The Meixian Airport is also being expanded recently. The Fifth Air Force Team recently sent several more fighter planes to be stationed there to facilitate military operations. (February 21)</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Kang Survey Group Inspects Guankou Irrigation Works</h3>
<p>丨The Whole Group Departs from Chengdu in Two Routes丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai reporters of the Sichuan-Kang Survey Group arrived in Chengdu on February 9. They originally intended to complete preparations within three days and then depart in two routes, one going to western Sichuan and the other to northern Sichuan, to make every effort to conduct survey work. However, Sichuan still observes the customs of the old lunar year. All industries are closed for the first five days of the new year, and there is no way to arrange for porters and food needed for the journey. Moreover, the generals of various fronts happened to gather in Chengdu to hold an anti-bandit meeting to discuss the second phase of the anti-bandit plan. Therefore, the reporter group decided to stay in Chengdu temporarily and take this opportunity to interview the generals once. The itinerary was also slightly delayed.</p>
<p>Chengdu Dam (the Main Hub of Various Rivers) (Photo by Wang Zhenhuan)</p>
<p>On February 12, they interviewed Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, and Yang Sen. All four said that the most important task at present is to suppress the bandits, and they must devote all their efforts to complete it in the shortest possible time. Since the recovery of Xuanhan, Dazhou, Yingshan, Yilong, and other counties, the military cooperation has been very effective, and it is quite possible to completely eliminate the bandits within a month. After the completion of the bandit suppression, the second step is the issue of post-war reconstruction. This issue includes the method of demobilizing troops throughout Sichuan and the method of unifying administration and finance. The purpose is to separate military power from political power so that finances can be balanced. The third step is to engage in development, that is, to pay attention to industrial construction, transportation, and so on.</p>
<p>On the 13th, they visited West China University. The university's dental department is the most complete. It is said to be the first in our country and the third in the world. The medical department and the liberal arts and science departments are all well-equipped. The entire school covers an area of more than a thousand acres, and the buildings are magnificent and the environment is extremely quiet. The museum houses a very rich collection of ancient artifacts and Xikang materials. There are 451 students in the university department, most of whom are able to concentrate on their studies. The founder of the school was an American named Bi Qi. He came to Sichuan alone, saw the good situation in Chengdu, and was determined to establish a university here. After more than twenty years of continuous efforts, fundraising, and planning, he finally achieved what he has today.</p>
<p>On the 15th, they went to Guankou to observe the irrigation works. In advance, Tong Zhiquan, who had served as the magistrate in charge of water conservancy, provided drawings, and Zhou Yuru, the current magistrate, explained them in detail, so they were able to understand the general situation. Guankou is located 140 miles northwest of Chengdu. The two sources of the Min River converge here and flow down into the Chengdu Dam. The Chengdu Dam is a very large plain with fourteen counties, millions of acres of farmland, fertile land, and crisscrossing ditches. There are nine major rivers, all of which branch out from Guankou. Therefore, Guankou is the main hub of all the rivers in the Chengdu Dam, and the drought and floods in the entire area are controlled by Guankou. During the Qin Dynasty, floods were rampant. Li Bing, the governor of Shu, and his son Erlang built the Lidui, Baopingkou, and Yu Zui Ma Cuo projects to ensure that the water flowing down had a fixed amount and could be controlled. During floods, water can be diverted into the outer river, and during droughts, it can all be diverted into the inner river. They also made rulers for measurement and compiled songs to facilitate memory. For thousands of years, water managers have followed them. Chengdu has no floods, and the people of Shu respect them as the Lord of Sichuan. The greatness of their achievements can be imagined. There is a temple there that enshrines the statues of Li Bing and his son. Local people are very respectful and remember their contributions to people's livelihood. On August 25 last year, the geological layer collapsed 400 miles from Guankou in the upper reaches of the Min River, causing landslides and water blockage, which suddenly reduced the amount of water downstream. According to investigations, the accumulated water has now frozen, and the earthquake has not yet stopped. There is fear that the ice will melt this spring and the old projects may not be able to withstand the floods. Therefore, measures have been taken to dredge the river so that it can continue to flow down. According to electrical engineer Luo Jingzhan, the water power of Guankou is extremely large and can generate more than 100,000 horsepower of electricity, which requires a capital of 40 to 50 million yuan. Only by experienced engineers can a huge project be successful. However, there are no factories nearby that can consume so much electricity, so it cannot be held until the industry has developed to a considerable level. At this time, we can only sit and watch the stream of water and waste its capacity.</p>
<p>After many days of contact, the country decided to depart in two routes. The first route goes to northern Sichuan, passes through the rear of the various armies, and returns to Chongqing. The second route goes to western Sichuan, passes through Ya'an to reach Daqianlu, and returns east along the Yangtze River, meeting the first route in Chongqing. Both routes take about a month and a half. In addition to production and construction, and social conditions, the first route will also observe the conditions of the bandit areas, and the second route will pay attention to border defense issues. Among the seven members of the group, Zhang Xianmei, Chen Youqin, and Liu Sida will take the first route, and Lu Yitang, Hui Ping, Su Dezheng, and Wang Zhenhuan will take the second route. The departure date is February 19. (Published from Chengdu on the 18th by Lixing)</p>
<h3>Verdict Announced on Appeal of Suzhou Car Accident Case</h3>
<p>Shi Guobin, a lieutenant colonel translator at the Nanjing Army University, was struck and killed by a car driven by Chen Jinsheng, the driver of Lu Tongcun, the Shanghai Bank district manager, on December 19 last year. Chen Jinsheng, the driver who caused the accident, was arrested by the police and sent to court, which sentenced him to two years in prison for causing death by negligence. The accompanying private lawsuit sought joint compensation for losses of 99,840 yuan. The defendants Lu Tongcun and Chen Jinsheng refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The Second Division concluded the trial and the presiding judge Wu executed the verdict yesterday (26th) at 3:00 PM. The main text stated that Chen Jinsheng's appeal was rejected and the original sentence was maintained. The original verdict of the accompanying private lawsuit was revoked and changed to a fine of 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xu Yabo's Appeal Ruled Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Xu Yabo, the former director of the First District of Jiangsu Water Police, was falsely accused of jointly committing robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison in the first instance. Xu refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which declared him not guilty. The prosecuting attorney refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. As a result, the case was sent back to the Jiangsu High Court for retrial. Yesterday (26th), Xu Yabo was declared not guilty.</p>
<h3>Wuxi and Bengbu Grain Merchants Oppose Increasing Commission</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Rice, Bean and Miscellaneous Grains Guild, previously due to low grain prices and sluggish market conditions that led to insufficient expenditure, jointly with the Wujin Guild, changed the original 99-to-1 exchange rate to 98.4. This was met with strong opposition from the Bengbu Grain Merchants' Guild, Transportation Guild, and Jiangsu Grain Merchants' Guild in Bengbu. Therefore, a joint meeting was convened on the previous day at Jiyu Hall, gathering the rice and bean merchants of Wuxi and Wujin counties to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that, according to Bengbu's precedent, a commission of one dime would be deducted for each dan (unit of weight) of miscellaneous grains priced at ten yuan or less. If the price per dan was more than ten yuan, the original 99-to-1 exchange rate would still be used. For example, if the price of soybeans was five yuan, deducting a commission of one dime would result in an exchange rate of 98. Currently, there is no possibility of miscellaneous grains rising to ten yuan per dan. If Bengbu grain merchants come to Wuxi to negotiate, this is how they will respond. After the meeting, Bengbu grain merchants came to Wuxi that evening and, upon learning the above information, found a significant difference in opinions between the two sides. They returned to Bengbu yesterday and will need to collectively discuss the matter within the three groups before coming to Wuxi again for negotiations.</p>
<h3>Ring Leader of the Bandit Gang in Changzhou Arrested for Crimes Committed in Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County Government recently received a tip that a person nicknamed "Stone" Yang Rongsheng, from Zhenglu Bridge Town in the northern part of the county, had gathered more than ten people to commit robbery at Wudong Bridge outside Qimen in Suzhou during the eighth month of last year. The county had already arrested a suspect in the case, Zhong Rongbing. However, Yang Rongsheng fled back to Changzhou and hid in Xixiashu Town. For prudence's sake, County Magistrate Cai specifically wrote to the Wuxian County Government to inquire whether the robbery case had occurred and whether the suspect, Zhong Rongbing, had identified Yang Rongsheng as the ringleader. A reply was received confirming that the situation was accurate. A detective team was secretly dispatched to Xixiashu to investigate and arrest Yang. They learned that Yang had escaped back to his home. They then went to Zhengliu Bridge to investigate and, at night, surrounded and arrested him at his home. On the 24th, he was sent to the county for interrogation. On the 25th, County Magistrate Cai sent a dispatch to the Wuxian County Government, requesting them to send police officers to Changzhou to escort him back for trial.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Organizes a Association to Promote National Products</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Capital Citizens' National Products Promotion Association held an inaugural meeting of initiators yesterday at Wujiaxiang, with over forty people attending. The Provincial Party Headquarters specially sent Wang Lu to attend and provide guidance. After the meeting opened, the report was presented first, followed by a discussion of the draft charter and funding issues. All matters were handed over to the preparatory committee. Finally, all the initiators voted to elect seven people as members of the preparatory committee. It is reported that the first preparatory meeting is scheduled for March 1st.</p>
<h3>Large Cannonball Found on the Riverside</h3>
<p>After the river tide receded yesterday, a large cannonball was suddenly discovered on the river beach of the local China Merchants Wharf. It weighed about seventy or eighty catties. Subsequently, a cleaner from the Fourth Precinct noticed it and carried it to the precinct.</p>
<h3>Only Two Money Exchange Shops Remaining in Xiannv Town, Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Xiannv Town, located in the fourth district of the county, is a bustling market town in the eastern countryside. Since the failure of the money and lumber industries, the market has also declined. During the lunar new year, Yuansheng and Fukang both closed down. This spring, Runkan money shop also went bankrupt. Currently, only two money shops remain in the town: Zhentai and Hengtai.</p>
<h3>Bandit Case Solved in Jinsha, Nantong</h3>
<p>A bandit robbery occurred in Jinsha on the morning of the 14th. Yuchang Lumber Company and other households suffered significant losses. The police and local militia have now solved the case and arrested the bandits Xu Dongkou, Zhang Jin, Xing Jiaru, and Qian Qiao. They were sent to the county government for interrogation on the 24th.</p>

<h3>Impressions of an Economic Survey in Guangxi Province (3) by Qian Jiaxun</h3>
<p>After arriving in Wuzhou, we stayed at the Danan Hotel and decided to hire a car to go to Yongning (Nanning) early the next morning. It is over a thousand li from Wuzhou to Yongning. Both water and land routes are available. The water route goes through Pingnan, Guiping, Guixian, Hengxian, Yongchun, etc. Taking the Yongwu Express Ferry takes about three days. The land route is the highway, going through Rongxian, Beiliu, Yulin, Guixian, Binyang, etc. The fastest it takes by car is one day, but you have to depart at 4:00 am and arrive at 8:00 or 9:00 pm. Otherwise, it takes two days, staying overnight in Guixian. We wanted to arrive in one day. We carried small luggage ourselves, and the big luggage was transported by ship. That afternoon, Deputy Commander Bai and Military Commander Xia sent us a note to invite us and Dr. Shi from the German medical team to dinner at Qunle Restaurant. At one o'clock, Deputy Officer Qiu picked us up in a car and first drove us around Wuzhou City, then took us to Zhongshan Park to visit the Zhongshan Memorial Hall. The hall is on the top of the mountain. Overlooking Wuzhou City, we saw the Fu River and the Great River converging here. The water was one green and one yellow, clearly demarcated, as if enveloping the whole city. The people of Guangxi also call it the Yuan River, truly a beautiful sight. After visiting the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, we went to the restaurant. At that time, Deputy Commander Bai was still in Yongning, and Military Commander Xia had not arrived either. The company included various chiefs of staff, division chiefs, and the chief of the Public Security Bureau. We took the opportunity to tell them that we might need to come to Wuzhou again for an economic survey and would need their help in many areas. After leaving Qunle Restaurant, reporters from the Wuzhou Republic Daily and Dagong Daily (not the Dagong Daily of Tianjin) came to visit and we spoke for half an hour. After the reporters left, we covered ourselves and went to sleep, preparing for the long journey the next day.</p>
<p>The next morning at four o'clock, Deputy Officer Qiu woke us up. After we washed and tidied up, we made a few minor adjustments to our scattered belongings and strolled out of the hotel to the ferry pier. At this time, the morning light was faint, and the streets were pitch black with not a soul in sight. A police officers were dozing by the side of the road. After arriving at the ferry pier, we had to sit in a "foreign paddle boat" for more than an hour to get to the Rongxu bus station (the Yongwu Highway only goes to Rongxu in Wuzhou). By the time we arrived, it was daylight. The four of us got into the hired car, and the car sped off. Although this section of the highway was relatively smooth, the speed of the car was so fast that it was very bumpy. We passed through Cenxi, Rongxian, Beiliu, Yulin, Xingye, etc. Along the way, there were sudden downpours and scorching sun, as if traveling in the desert. At the same time, the differences in climate in various places could be seen in the crops. Some rice was heavy with grain, nearing harvest time, while in other places, the rice was only a foot long. After passing Guixian, the mountains were somewhat different from what we were used to seeing. The peaks of the rocky mountains were towering, exquisite, and verdant. We were like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden for the first time, praising without ceasing, unable to take it all in, almost forgetting that we were on a journey. It was not until later, when we arrived at Yangshuo and Guilin and saw the bizarre shapes of the hills, that we realized that what we had seen today was only the dregs of the Guangxi landscape.</p>
<p>Our car did not arrive in Nanning until 9:00 pm. After this sixteen-hour ordeal, coupled with the occasional rain and sunshine and the unpredictable cold and heat, not only was my body exhausted to the extreme, but I also caught a cold. After taking two aspirin tablets, I covered myself and went to sleep. The next morning, we went to the provincial government to pay our respects to Mr. Huang Xuchu, the chairman of the provincial government. Mr. Huang was taciturn, a man of great cultivation and decisiveness. We briefly reported on our journey. We originally intended to conduct an in-depth study of Guangxi's economic problems in Nanning based on existing materials before making plans for a field economic survey, so as to avoid the suspicion of armchair theorizing. Now, we were very willing to hear the opinions of their top leaders on Guangxi's economic construction. Mr. Huang's attitude was sincere and humble. He first expressed his warm welcome to our visit. Regarding the issue of Guangxi's economic construction, he said that he was completely ignorant and hoped that we economic experts would give him guidance. He then asked Mr. Yang Chuo'an, the director of the Bureau of Statistics, to be responsible for entertaining us, because the Bureau of Statistics had many ready-made books and statistical data. So we stayed at the Guangxi Bureau of Statistics.</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed British Envoy to China, Sir Odo Russell, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Meet with the National Government Authorities in Beijing on the Second of Next Month</p>
<p>Will Present Credentials Next Week and Then Head North to Peiping</p>
<p>The British Chamber of Commerce and the United China Association Will Hold a Banquet Next Week</p>
<p>Sir Odo Russell, the newly appointed British Envoy to China, arrived in Shanghai on the British company liner "Chitral" to take up his new post with his wife and daughter. The representatives of the local Chinese and foreign communities boarded the ship to welcome him. The British Envoy disembarked at 9:15 and went directly to the British Consulate General for a short rest before checking into the Cathay Hotel. He is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 2nd and present his credentials next week. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival Situation</h3>
<p>The "Chitral" entered Songkou at 6:20 yesterday morning and arrived at the Gonghexing Wharf at 7:30. The British Envoy had decided to disembark at 9:15, so he had breakfast on board. He then gathered with the welcoming personnel on board for a chat. At 9:15, led by the British Chargé d'Affaires to China, Erringland, and others, they disembarked and took cars to the British Consulate General on the Garden Bridge for a rest. Security was extremely tight along the way. Inside the consulate general, the British Shanghai Marine Corps and the military band were standing to welcome him. When the car carrying the British Envoy turned from the Garden Bridge into the gate of the consulate, the military music played in unison, and the soldiers raised their guns in salute. The British Envoy walked into the consulate in the sound of the beautiful military music to rest, and then checked into the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Personnel</h3>
<p>Those who went to the pier to welcome him yesterday morning included Geng Jiaji, the representative of Mayor Wu; Yu Ming, the Director of the External Affairs Office; Xie Fusheng, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Erringland, the British Chargé d'Affaires, and his secretary Eddington; British Consul-General in Shanghai, White Lee Nan; Consul Blackpon; Hallman, the First Secretary of the Embassy; William Wylly, Aviation Military Attaché; Justice Musu of the British Assessor's Office; Military Attaché Weir Lock; Marshal, the President of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, and dozens of others.</p>
<h3>The Demeanor of the British Envoy</h3>
<p>In addition to his wife and three daughters, there were also two attendants on the same ship with the British Envoy. As for Mr. Tai Qimen, the Chinese Secretary of the British Embassy, he had gone to Hong Kong a few days ago to represent the Chargé d'Affaires to welcome him and also arrived in Shanghai on the ship yesterday morning. In addition, Sir Teichman, the former Counselor of the British Embassy, returned to Hong Kong a few days ago after returning to the UK with the former British Envoy Lampson last year. This time he arrived in Shanghai on the same ship as the new Envoy. The British Envoy is about forty years old, with a light yellow beard, a tall and slender body, and bright and amiable eyes. Although Sir Odo has come to China for the first time, he has a very good understanding of the situation in the East.</p>
<h3>Declining Social Engagements</h3>
<p>Because the British Envoy is in the mourning period for King Albert I of Belgium, he has decided to decline all outside banquets. Therefore, the banquet set by Mayor Wu Tiecheng and others has now been canceled. However, the joint banquet of the British Chamber of Commerce and the United China Association in the city tomorrow night has been specially approved by the British Foreign Office. Because this banquet is an opportunity for the British Envoy to exchange views with the leaders of the British community, it will not be postponed. It is also heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is also planning to hold a dinner party, and Xie Fusheng has gone to inquire whether it can be approved. The reply has not yet been received. Sir Odo is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 2nd and present his credentials in the middle of next week, and then go north to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Mourning King of Belgium</h3>
<p>After arriving at the Consulate General at 9:15, the British Envoy discussed the situation of the journey with Chargé d'Affaires Erringland. At 11:30, he drove to Tianzhu Church Street with Erringland and Consul-General White Lee Nan to participate in the ceremony to mourn the former King of Belgium. At about 12:00, he returned to the Cathay Hotel to rest. As for one of his daughters, she caught a cold during the trip and was sent to the hospital for treatment at about 3:00 in the afternoon and is expected to recover in a few days.</p>

<h3>Releasing a Statement</h3>
<p>At 8:40 yesterday morning, the British Envoy met with Chinese and foreign journalists in the hall on the ship and released a statement, saying: "I am deeply honored to be appointed as the Envoy to China. I received the order to make the mission last September, but I could not start the trip immediately due to some matters. It was not until today that I was able to arrive here safely. The friendly relations between China and Britain have always been very good. I will do my best in the future to seek ways to promote friendship between the two countries, so that the friendly relations between the two countries will be even better." After arriving in Shanghai today, I decided to take a short rest in Shanghai. I am scheduled to go to Beijing on March 2 to visit the National Government authorities. However, the date of presenting credentials will be determined after arriving in Beijing." The British Envoy then talked about the revision of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, saying, "When I left the UK, I did not receive any instructions from the government regarding the revision of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, so I have no opinion to express. I will carefully study this issue in the future so as to come up with a concrete plan to contribute to the government for adoption." As for the issue of moving the British Embassy to Beijing, in principle, the embassy should be in Beijing in order to facilitate contact. But in fact, it is necessary to consider all aspects."</p>
<h3>Portuguese Envoy Returns Home This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Portuguese Envoy to China, Mr. Zhuba Weiya, has requested leave to return home. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 24th of this month. After arriving in Shanghai, the Portuguese Envoy is scheduled to leave Shanghai by ship at about 1:00 this afternoon to return home. He will return to China in six months to cancel his leave.</p>

Last night, Song told reporters in the train that he would stay in Beijing for a short time and leave in about two or three weeks to go to Xi'an via the Longhai Railway and then to various places in the Northwest for inspection.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Others Returned to Beijing</h3>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce Xia Chen, and Commissioners Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Zou Lin, Liu Ruiheng, and Zeng Zhongming returned to Beijing by night train last night.</p>
<h3>National Government Advisor Frank Hinckley Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Released a Written Statement</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Hinckley, the American advisor to the National Government, traveled around the world on the order of the National Government for talks, which lasted for eighteen months. Mr. Hinckley arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Dollar Company's President Johnson and is scheduled to go to Beijing this Thursday (March 1) to report everything to the National Government authorities. The translated version of the written statement released by Mr. Hinckley in Shanghai is as follows:</p>
<p>"During my travels abroad, I met with many important political figures in Western countries. According to the representatives, they all trust the Nanjing National Government and are prepared to give it full assistance. They also feel that in order to promote the sale of their manufactured surplus products, they should also consult with the Nanjing National Government in order to have hope. In addition, I have had many contacts with business and industrial leaders in various countries, especially in the United States. The market situation in the United States is very bad at present, and many capitalists are willing to invest huge amounts of capital in China and seek to revitalize trade with China. They intend to obtain the credit of the Chinese side by adopting a new method of Sino-foreign cooperation. On the 15th of this month, I reported this matter to the National Government, but the content is too long to go into detail. If the issue of consular jurisdiction is resolved, American merchants can be tolerant of Chinese business habits in their dealings with Chinese companies and shops, so that they can trust each other. I am drafting two different plans to enable China to get rid of the shackles of unequal treaties as soon as possible in the spirit of mutual concessions. As soon as these two plans are drafted, they will be submitted to the National Government for research. Last summer, I traveled to Soviet Russia, and as a result, I felt more than ever that communism is absolutely incompatible with the national conditions of China. People of the world, except for the Communist Party, feel that Chinese culture is superior to other cultures. Unfortunately, the Chinese people have fallen into extreme poverty, and the reason for their poverty is mostly due to the foreign forces under the protection of unequal treaties. If unequal treaties continue to exist, the Communists will have an excuse to slander the National Government, thinking that the National Government condones foreigners to dominate China with unequal treaties as a talisman. May I ask whether there are any foreigners in China who are controlled by the Communist Party and are unwilling to reform the status quo according to reason? If not, why not unite with the general public, support the National Government, and cooperate with it? In this way, China can still be open to foreigners, and foreigners can make full use of China's large market and the goodwill of the Chinese people to promote international trade and international prosperity. Since October 1930, I have been working on the issue of the US government directly lending money to China. Regarding this matter, my colleagues in the United States and I have spent a great deal of effort and patience. The process has been written into a report and submitted to the National Government. No matter what the outcome of this matter is, it must be entirely attributed to the National Government, because the National Government has given correct guidance and constantly encouraged my work for Sino-US friendship. US President Roosevelt is, in my opinion, an ideal figure among Americans. His handwritten $50 million wheat loan to China will occupy an important page in Chinese history."</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the German Envoy to Make a Clear Statement on His Attitude Towards the Puppet Manchukuo</h3>
<p>And Sent a Letter to the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that Germany has recently had a proposal to recognize the puppet Manchukuo. According to reports, the country has denied the news, but there is no clear statement. Therefore, the German Envoy in Peiping was telegraphed to make a clear statement on his attitude towards the puppet Manchukuo, and the German Chamber of Commerce was also sent a letter to pay attention. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegraph to the German Envoy</h3>
<p>To His Excellency the German Envoy in Peiping: Cooperation between our two countries has made great progress in recent years. This kind of connection is completely built on the basis of your country's sympathy for China. In particular, your country's just attitude towards the case of the three northeastern provinces when it attended the League of Nations last year was praised by our country. However, there have been rumors in the international community recently, seeking to alienate the friendship between the two countries. It is believed that His Excellency is already familiar with them. In order to maintain the commercial future of the two countries, our association would like His Excellency to reaffirm your country's sympathy for China and its fair attitude, and to convey to your government the importance that our country's public opinion attaches to this issue. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Letter to the German Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>To the esteemed German Chamber of Commerce,</p>
<p>We begin by noting that cooperation between our two nations has seen significant progress recently. This situation is undoubtedly familiar to your esteemed Chamber and is a cause for mutual celebration for the future of both our countries. Our association believes the reason for this lies in the fact that both our nations find ourselves in the midst of difficult struggles. This naturally gives rise to a feeling of sympathy towards China. The impartial attitude your nation adopted towards the Manchurian Incident when attending the League of Nations last year sufficiently demonstrates the accuracy of our association's words. Unfortunately, there have been recent international rumors and telegrams implicating your nation. They claim that you will alter your previous policy regarding the Manchurian Incident. Although this is a form of propaganda stemming from a conspiracy, intending to sow discord between our two nations, a common saying in our country states, "No wind, no waves." Therefore, our association, for the sake of the future of both our nations, cannot but pay serious attention to this matter. We also hope that your esteemed Chamber, with its standing as a leader in the business community, can introduce the opinions of the people of our nation to your government. At the same time, this may also awaken your government to pay serious attention to this matter. This is addressed to the German Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors Discusses Increasing Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>Foreign Taxpayers Not Yet Able to Accept</p>
<p>At the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting on the 21st of this month, a letter from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association was presented. Based on the text and spirit of the documents exchanged when the Chinese Directorships were initially established in early 1928, it requested that the number of Chinese Directors be increased from five to nine within this year. The letter also expressed the hope that the number of Chinese Directors could be increased to match the proportion of Chinese tax contributions, so that Chinese and foreign residents could cooperate more closely and mutually benefit. After discussion, the Board of Directors expressed great sympathy for the wishes expressed by the Chinese residents in the letter. However, given that the election of Chinese Directors has only been in place for a short time, and in light of the prevailing public opinion among foreigners, the foreign directors felt that increasing the number was not appropriate at this time. Moreover, they were concerned that this proposal would be difficult to gain unanimous support from all the relevant nations. They decided to reply to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association with this sentiment. The request to increase the number of Chinese Directors is based on the proportion of tax contributions from Chinese and foreign citizens. According to the calculations of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, this was 55 to 45 in 1928, and is now 64 to 36. However, the Board of Directors' discussion revealed that this calculation was based on a misunderstanding. In fact, in 1927, the amount of municipal general taxes paid by the Chinese accounted for 62 percent, while foreigners accounted for 38 percent, which is not much different from the current ratio of</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>64 to 36. As for the ratio of 55 to 45 mentioned for 1928, it was the result of combining the four major revenue sources: municipal taxes, land taxes, license fees, and wharf dues. If calculated in the same way at this moment, the ratio would be approximately 57 to 43. If the amount of municipal fees provided by a certain group of residents is the sole basis for their number of representatives, there are many who oppose this view. As for the relationship between Chinese and foreign directors in recent years, it has been extremely harmonious. This is naturally due to the efforts of both sides to understand each other and express mutual sympathy. However, the foreign directors deeply feel that foreign taxpayers are not yet able to accept the idea of increasing the number of Chinese directors to the same number as foreign directors at this time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Promotes Factory Safety</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, in order to promote factory safety in the city and to understand the actual conditions of each factory, had planned to engage in factory inspections and factory surveys. However, the factory inspection has been hindered by the authorities of the concessions and has not been able to proceed. The factory survey has already been completed. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection</h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, factory inspections have been difficult to carry out even in the city due to obstruction from the concession authorities. However, given the importance of factory safety equipment, a solution should be sought quickly. Our authorities are planning to break the deadlock within the next two months and prevent this situation from continuing indefinitely. Before Director Li Pingheng of the Ministry of Industry travels abroad to attend the International Labour Conference, if there is still no practical solution, this case will be brought before the International Labour Conference to seek a fair decision. Currently, the Ministry of Industry is still working hard on factory inspections. Cities such as Qingdao and Hangzhou have already started to implement them. Recently, the Ministry of Industry will also conduct factory inspections in Wuxi, as Wuxi is an important industrial area with numerous factories. The work of inspecting factories should be urgently planned and implemented. It is likely that the authorities of this city will be consulted again at an appropriate time to carry out the work of inspecting factories in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Detailed Investigation of Factory Conditions</h3>
<p>Although the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau cannot currently carry out factory inspections, it has conducted a detailed investigation of the actual conditions of each factory. This will be done annually in the future. The information collected last year has been compiled into a "Directory of Shanghai Factories for the 22nd Year", which is expected to be finalized and published in the near future. After the publication of this directory, the investigation into the actual conditions of each factory in this city this year will continue.</p>
<h3>Inventory of Cultural Relics Stored in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Waiting for All Preparations to be Completed</p>
<p>Before a Date Can Be Set for the Inventory</p>
<p>New News Agency reports that the cultural relics from the Palace Museum transported to Shanghai for preservation have been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be supervised and assisted in inventory matters by representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government. It is said that the Municipal Party Headquarters has appointed Wu Xiu and Cai Hongtian as representatives, and the Municipal Government has appointed Li Dachao, the director of the First Section, as a representative. After the Shanghai Office completes the preparations for the inventory, it will notify each representative in writing to choose a date to carry out the inventory procedures. Yesterday, it was widely rumored in this city that Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, had returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou. The representatives of the two agencies were immediately notified to hold a discussion at the Yong'an Street Office at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th (yesterday) to discuss various procedures. A reporter from the New News Agency went to the office to inquire. According to the person in charge, there was no such meeting at the office, and there was no need to hold a meeting for the inventory of cultural relics. As for the date of the inventory with the two agencies, it has not yet been determined. It is necessary to wait until all preparations are completed before a date can be set for the inventory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Pays Attention to Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>Submitting a Request for Each Law and Regulation to be Studied Before it is Put to a Vote</p>
<p>The Chamber Can Provide Answers for Various Industries if They Encounter Difficulties</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that industrial and commercial laws and regulations are of great importance to the interests of each industry, and has therefore established an Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee to conduct research. It is learned that the Chamber yesterday submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan, requesting that the draft of each law and regulation be submitted to the Chamber for research before it is put to a vote. At the same time, it notified each industry that if they encounter any difficulties with laws and regulations, they should notify the Chamber in writing so that it can conduct research on their behalf. The letter of submission is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Submission to the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Submission Regarding a Request, It has been found that since the establishment of your esteemed Yuan, various industrial and commercial laws and regulations in our country have been successively formulated, and there are already many types. However, the purpose of legislation should not only advance with the trends of the world, but also seek to be in line with national conditions. The area where our association is located is the center of our country's commercial market, and the soundness of the formulation of laws is deeply and greatly related to the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce. Therefore, since last year, we have established an Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee, inviting experts and giants from various industries to engage in the research of industrial and commercial laws and regulations. We have learned that when your esteemed Yuan formulates the Constitution, it first discloses the initial draft in the newspapers for criticism from all walks of life as a step towards accepting amendments. This is a display of impartiality that we deeply admire. Although industrial and commercial laws and regulations cannot be compared to the fundamental laws of the country, they cannot be ignored from the point of view of their relationship to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we venture to submit this document to your esteemed Yuan for review and approval. Hereafter, when drafting industrial and commercial laws and regulations, we humbly request that the original draft be issued to our association for research before it is put to a vote, so that we can do our best to contribute our sincerity and assist your esteemed Yuan. We deeply implore this.</p>
<h3>Letter to Various Associations</h3>
<p>Esteemed Sirs, At the 65th Standing Committee meeting of the association held on the 22nd of this month, the meeting resolutions of the Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations Research Committee of the association were discussed, proposing to send a circular to various industry associations and store members, stating that if they encounter any difficulties regarding industrial and commercial laws and regulations in the future, they can report them in writing, so that we can research and reply. The matter has been discussed and approved on record. Correspondingly, we send a circular to notify you, hoping that you will take note. In the future, if any difficult problems arise regarding the Wang Commercial Law and Regulations, you can notify the association in writing at any time, so that we can forward them for research and reply.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Stamp Tax Bureau to Discuss Stamp Inspection Methods</h3>
<p>Personnel from Branch Offices Will Accompany in Wusong and Other Places</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday wrote to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau to discuss stamp inspection methods. The original letter is recorded as follows: Esteemed Sirs, It has been found that your bureau's inspection of whether stamp taxes have been omitted or not, according to your authority, is carried out at any time, originally for the purpose of benefiting tax revenue. However, the situation in each rural town is different. If a thorough, cautious, and careful method can be properly planned, it can be handled in your bureau, which can reduce misunderstandings, and inland stores can be spared unnecessary suspicion. Therefore, our association proposes three matters to your bureau: (1) Our association has branch offices in Wusong, Jiangwan, and Pudong. We propose that when stamp inspections are carried out in these three places, the branch offices should be notified to appoint personnel to accompany them. (2) A receipt should be issued to the inspected store for any violations found. (3) For various account books and documents, the inspector should instruct the store clerk to open the cabinets themselves and take out the items for inspection. The above three points do not harm public affairs and are beneficial to commercial sentiment. Your bureau has always been accommodating to commercial sentiment and should be able to grant our request. Accordingly, this letter is sent to request your consideration and reply.</p>
<h3>Special Party Headquarters of the Two Railways Supports Wang and Chiang's True Telegram</h3>
<p>Hoping that Compatriots Across the Country Can Appreciate These Words</p>
<p>Unanimously Advocate for Saving the Nation from Peril</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang of China, Jinghu, Huhangyong Railways, yesterday sent a telegram to various newspapers across the country to be forwarded to party headquarters and governments at all levels and mass organizations: (Above omitted) Unfortunately, China is plagued by disasters. Externally, the violent Japanese are wreaking havoc, and internally, the Red bandits are rampant. The entire nation is united in sincerity, jointly seeking cooperation to maintain the current situation of disintegration and achieve economic, cultural, and other constructions. Upon reading the true telegram jointly addressed by Wang and Chiang, reiterating the importance of saving the nation and seeking survival, treating suppressing the reds and punishing the rebellious as a cure for the symptoms, and production and construction as a plan for a fundamental cure, we feel even more that it is a targeted remedy for maintaining the party-state, eliminating chaos, and seeking governance, which should be wholeheartedly supported and promoted for its realization to consolidate the foundation of the country. We also hope that compatriots across the country can appreciate these words, unanimously advocate, and strive to promote them in order to achieve national unification and save the nation from peril. We respectfully report this, and we are endlessly expectant. The Special Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang of China, Jinghu, Huhangyong Railways, kowtows and begs forgiveness.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Investigates and Confiscates Private Official and Military Telegrams</h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau yesterday received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, stating that the use of official and military stationery to send private military telegrams has been repeatedly ordered by the Ministry to be investigated and confiscated by the bureaus. However, recently, the number of these private official and military telegrams has increased again, not only affecting telegraph revenue, but also congesting lines, causing delays in important telegrams. If strict measures are not taken, the harm will be great. In order to effectively rectify the situation, the Ministry has once again revised the measures for investigating and confiscating private official and military telegrams as follows: (1) Private official and military telegrams should be detained by the sending, receiving, and relaying bureaus in accordance with regulations. (2) All congratulatory telegrams sent by party, government, and military agencies using official stationery, except for telegrams sent to the central government to celebrate national events, which should be classified as first-class telegrams, shall be charged as social telegrams. (3) All coded telegrams sent by government and military personnel to other government and military personnel or private individuals using official stationery must be confirmed to be sent on official business. If it is found to be private business, fees shall be charged in accordance with regulations. (4) If the personnel of the sending and receiving bureaus fail to detain private official and military telegrams that pass through them, once discovered, each shall be fined two cents per word. (5) If the sending bureau does not detain private official and military telegrams and is detained by the receiving bureau, in addition to the sending bureau personnel being fined two cents per word as stipulated above, the receiving bureau personnel shall be awarded two cents per word. (6) The original copies of outgoing telegrams or copies of incoming telegrams of private official and military telegrams detained by the sending or receiving bureaus shall be submitted to the Ministry for verification on a monthly basis. (7) When the receiving bureau detains private official and military telegrams, there is no need to notify the sending bureau with an official telegram. The recipient should be charged for the service and delivery of the telegram, and the copy of the telegram should still be submitted for verification. (8) These measures will be implemented starting March 1, 1934. The above measures, in addition to being submitted to the Executive Yuan, have also been communicated to the Military Commission and the Ministry of Military Administration to be notified to all telegraph personnel for investigation and compliance. It is hereby ordered that the bureau shall comply with these measures to maintain telegraph administration.</p>
<h3>Li Jingcong is About to Go to Guangdong to Survey Airport Sites on the Guangdong-Shaanxi Line</h3>
<p>Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai last Saturday after test-flying the Ping-Shaanxi line. Yesterday, a reporter from New Voice News visited him to inquire about the date of the opening of the Ping-Shaanxi line and the trip to Guangdong to survey airport sites. According to Mr. Li, he returned to Shanghai on Saturday and started handling company affairs today (yesterday). The exact date for the opening of the Ping-Shaanxi line is still to be discussed and decided, and a definite answer cannot be given yet. In short, it will not be later than next month. As for going to Guangzhou to inspect the airport sites in order to open the Guangdong-Shaanxi line, the travel date can be decided as soon as the company affairs are sorted out.</p>
<h3>Distributing Bonuses to Staff Who Participated in the Shanghai Battle on the Two Railways</h3>
<p>Instructing the Engineering Department's Pu Dengqing to be in Charge</p>
<p>In order to allocate bonuses to staff who participated in wartime work, the Two Railways Administration yesterday issued orders to the Engineering, Transportation, and Mechanical Departments, stating that on February 15th of this year, former Director Chen Xinghan approved a letter stating that Zhou Zhenyao, the former Chief of the General Affairs Section of the former General Affairs Department, reported that the 19th Route Army had a bonus of 1,000 yuan after the January 28th Incident and asked to distribute it to the staff who participated in the wartime work and were effective. As the amount was small, there was a proposal to allocate the funds to the memorial hall fund for the staff who died during the January 28th Incident. The funds were stored separately and managed by the accounting staff at the time. When the funds were transferred, they were forgotten to be listed. Now, the 1,000 yuan is supplemented and requested to be forwarded to the Railway Bureau. Accordingly, the original bonus of 1,000 yuan is enclosed and sent to your bureau, requesting that you count and issue a receipt. As the funds are intended for the staff of the 19th Route Army who contributed to the January 28th war, they should be distributed accordingly. The funds are currently temporarily stored by the General Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department for collection. Therefore, you are ordered to assign two senior officials who were on duty at the time to investigate the case, properly allocate the funds, and instruct Pu Dengqing, Deputy Director of the Engineering Department, to be in charge. In addition to ordering compliance, you are also required to report the handling situation together for the record. This is the order.</p>

<h3>Removal of Shallow Water Fee in North China</h3>
<p>Original Status Restored on March 1st</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau North China Ships Resume Service</p>
<p>Every winter, due to difficult navigation on the icy river, shipping companies in North China typically increase shallow water freight rates by 20% starting December 1st. Now, as the weather warms and the Baihe River is navigable without obstruction, the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have agreed to cancel the shallow water fee for the icy river period, effective March 1st. Additionally, the China Merchants Bureau's North China liners, "Xinfeng" and "Xinming," suspended service after the Fujian Incident and were dedicated to official duties. Now that the remnants of the 19th Route Army from Fuzhou have been transported to Pukou and transferred to Henan for reorganization, a third batch of over 10,000 soldiers has been loaded onto Nanjing shipping vessels.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Struggles to Ban Tortoise Slaughter</h3>
<p>No Government Ban Issued</p>
<p>Investigation and Prohibition for Sanitation Reasons</p>
<p>The Chinese Association for the Protection of Animals, based on reports from its members, stated that several small boats are constantly moored along the river near Xujiahui, Shanghai, specializing in catching and killing tortoises year-round, with the slaughter being especially severe during the autumn and winter. The killing involves cracking shells, digging out meat, and shedding fresh blood, a horrific sight. Although tortoises are small creatures and harmless to humans, and not a staple food, why not let them live and die freely? Therefore, the Association recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, requesting them to issue an order to strictly prohibit the slaughter to uphold benevolence and save all living beings. Details have been reported in this newspaper. We have learned that the Bureau responded to the Chinese Association for the Protection of Animals yesterday, stating: "Upon investigation, Buddhism values compassion and advocates abstaining from killing, the intention of which is undoubtedly commendable. However, in practice, it cannot be used as a basis for government orders. Philanthropists often spend money to buy turtles to release them, but many in society still enjoy eating them. Government agencies have always adopted a laissez-faire policy and have never issued a ban. Furthermore, the Xujiahui area of this city is where many Catholics reside, and most of them are very fond of eating tortoises. An abrupt prohibition would undoubtedly cause resentment. As for the blood and flesh and the swarms of mosquitoes and flies mentioned in your letter, if they affect public health, they will naturally be subject to prohibition. We intend to order the relevant Sixth District Second Precinct to investigate and handle the matter."</p>
<h3>Young Man Swallows Half a Bottle of Lysol, Fortunately Rescued by a Tea Boy</h3>
<p>Life Still Uncertain</p>
<p>At around 10 PM the day before yesterday, a young traveler arrived at the Hongyun Hotel on Haining Road and booked Room 19. He signed his name as Huang Chengji, 21 years old, from Wuxi, in the guest register. It is unknown what stimulation the young man suffered, but he developed suicidal thoughts. He immediately swallowed a bottle of Lysol he had brought with him in the room. Fortunately, the hotel tea boy, Lin Agao, caught a glimpse of this and immediately stepped forward to snatch it away. However, he had already consumed more than half of it. The tea boy immediately ran to the front desk and reported it, and they then reported it to the Hongkou Police Department. Detective Zhang Guisheng was dispatched to investigate and learned that the young man's name was Huang Yongjian. He was transported to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. He is currently receiving treatment, and his life is still uncertain. The detective repeatedly questioned him about the reason for his suicide attempt, but he refused to reveal the truth. The young man is of medium build, wearing a striped cloth jacket, striped cloth padded trousers, and running shoes. His appearance does not resemble that of a lower-class person.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Exchange Rate Soars Amidst U.S. Silver Price Increase</h3>
<p>The price of silver dollars in the local market has suddenly soared due to the influence of the United States raising silver prices. Yesterday, the listed exchange rate reached 3,190 cash coins per silver dollar, and 12.246 cents per double dime, which is a difference of more than 200 cash coins per dollar compared to the previous week. As a result, small-scale operators who carry goods by shoulder or hand are greatly affected. According to people in the money industry, the exchange rate may continue to rise.</p>
<h3>A Female Buddhist Nun with Burned Hands and Feet Found on an Open Space in Hujia Wood Bridge</h3>
<p>Recounts the Experience of Being Murdered After Regaining Consciousness</p>
<p>Dies Immediately After Recounting</p>
<p>The body of a female Buddhist nun was found on an open space on Quan Jia An Road in Hujia Wood Bridge, Hongkou, North Shanghai. Her hands and feet were charred. Villagers gathered around to watch. Officer Liu of the Fifth District Third Precinct rushed to investigate. Unexpectedly, the female nun suddenly regained consciousness. When asked about the cause, she groaned and said her name was Liu Fengshi, her husband's name was Liu Zigui, and she was from Funing. Last year, due to family reasons, she volunteered to be a vegetarian and chant Buddhist scriptures. Her husband sent her to Shanghai to become a nun at the Weishēng Temple in Hongkou. The abbess was named Li Guizhen. When she first came to Shanghai, her husband gave her more than 500 silver dollars to provide for her comfortable living. However, after several months, the abbess swindled her out of almost all of it and recently forced her to go out to solicit donations. However, as she was devoted to self-cultivation, she was not skilled in this area, so she refused. The old nun resented this, severely punished her, and poured anesthetic medicine on her, causing her to become unconscious. She did not know how she ended up here. She was in excruciating pain, and her hands and feet were burned. After speaking, her breath was faint. When they tried to ask more questions, she died immediately. Officer Liu immediately reported to the chief and ordered a thorough investigation. There was no Weishēng Temple by that name, so it must be another name. He ordered the neighborhood chief to report to the local court and appoint Prosecutor Xie.</p>
<h3>Wheel of Fortune Gambling Den Busted in a Grand Building on Avenue Haig</h3>
<p>Comparable to the One Set Up by Cassia in the Past</p>
<p>Operated by Jewish White Russian Yao Kesutuoto</p>
<p>Brazilian Consul Actually Sent a Letter Claiming He Was Brazilian</p>
<p>But Yao's Nationality Has Been Verified by the Police Authority</p>
<p>| Result: Yao Detained, Hearing Postponed |</p>
<p>The grand building at No. 1475, Lane 1, Avenue Haig, is the property of the British firm, Terry &amp; Co. Last autumn, Zhang Chengde rented the house from the firm, signing a lease and paying a monthly rent of over 280 yuan. No one initially knew what he was using it for, but soon the police authorities discovered that a very large Wheel of Fortune gambling den was set up inside. The operator was a Jewish White Russian named Yao Kesutuoto (Y. Shutte). Zhang Chengde, the tenant, was merely a figurehead. The equipment inside the gambling den was comparable to the one</p>
<h3>Brazilian Cassia</h3>
<p>Organized on Tongfu Road in the past. Therefore, every night, dozens of gamblers frequented it, with at least forty or fifty, even on frosty, snowy, or rainy nights. The gamblers were a mix of Chinese and foreigners, men and women. However, there were more Chinese. The amount of winnings and losses and the richness of the prizes were said to be astounding. Yao started operating in August of last year and has been doing so until now. The amount of illegal income is considerable. The police authorities had heard about it early on, but they continued to investigate secretly because they had not fully understood its essence. Every night, detectives were dispatched to the vicinity of the den to</p>
<h3>Observe Gamblers Entering and Exiting</h3>
<p>Recently, they went a step further, selecting detectives and having them disguised as gamblers, mixing into the den. Only then did they get a complete picture and know for sure that it was set up by Yao. On Friday of the previous week, they requested arrest warrants and search warrants from the First Special District Court. They originally planned to secretly raid and arrest that night. Unexpectedly, the gambling lord was extremely resourceful and found out in advance. Gambling was stopped that night, and Yao temporarily hid, causing the detectives to make a futile trip. Fearing that this would cause alarm and allow the gambling lord to escape, they immediately investigated</p>
<h3>The Whereabouts of Yao's Hiding Place</h3>
<p>They soon learned that he was hiding at No. 504, Broadway Road. Hui Sikaosi, a Western detective from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, went to the address with a Chinese detective on the morning of the day before yesterday at 11 AM and arrested Yao. Then, at 4:30 PM, they searched the gambling den again and confiscated chips for Wheel of Fortune gambling and nine dozen pencils used for counting, paper, rubber bands, tablecloths, and other items, which were all taken back to the police station. Upon learning of this, the Consul General of Brazil stationed in Shanghai prepared two official letters, one addressed to President Guo of the First Special District Court and the other to the Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court, and</p>
<h3>Personally Brought the Two Letters to the Court</h3>
<p>To prove that Yao was a Brazilian national. As it was a holiday that day, the Consul left the letters and left. However, the police authorities had already investigated and clarified the nationality of the gambling lord with the Foreign Nationals Registration Office of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. He was indeed a Jewish White Russian, with his own photo and that of his wife, as well as his signature as proof. Therefore, yesterday morning, the police station sent Yao to the First Special District Court and charged him with the crime of running a gambling den and skimming profits, violating Article 280 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over the interrogation. Bai Taili, the secretary of the Brazilian consulate, was sent to the court to observe. First, Ru BaoYi and Qian Xunjiu, lawyers for the police station, stated the process of the police station's investigation of the case, and</p>
<h3>This Trial Arrested the Defendant</h3>
<p>The situation. Next, the Western detective in charge reported the arrest of the defendant and the search of the gambling den, presenting each of the confiscated exhibits to the court. Judge Wu then questioned the defendant. Unexpectedly, the defendant was arrogant and claimed that he was a Brazilian national and did not want to speak in a Chinese court. If they wanted him to confess, they had to send him to the Brazilian consulate, which was purely empty talk with no evidence provided to prove that he was a Brazilian national. Therefore, at the end, the lawyer for the police station stated that the defendant's attitude in court was illegal. However, the case still needed to be postponed, and they requested that the defendant be detained. The court approved the request and ordered the defendant to be detained for a later hearing. It is said that in order to make the judge understand the contents of the gambling den, the police station planned to ask Judge Wu to conduct an on-site inspection.</p>
<p>Inspectors and forensic examiners arrived at the scene and determined that the deceased was a woman about 20 years old and had died from burns. They filled out the coroner's report, took photos, and the hall took charge of the body for encoffinment. An immediate investigation revealed that there was only one Lianhua Nunnery in Hongkou, with the abbess being a Cantonese woman named Shun Jin, and there were no nuns. Therefore, they could not find any leads. They were ordered to continue the investigation and apprehension.</p>
<h3>Death of Mr. Qin Lizhai, Staff Member of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Mr. Qin Lizhai, a staff member of this newspaper, was the son of Mr. Pingfu, a veteran in the newspaper industry. He joined the newspaper in 1922, responsible for translating foreign news. He was diligent and hardworking. In his spare time, he also translated foreign telegrams for the National Society and occasionally contributed to travel magazines. Mr. Qin was usually quiet and rarely smiled, but he was sincere and honest in dealing with people. He was also very frugal and did not indulge in any worldly pleasures. He was respected by his colleagues. During the January 28th Incident, Mr. Qin Lizhai Image</p>
<p>He lived in Zhabei and was trapped in the siege, experiencing great hardship before reaching safety. Mr. Qin was already weak, and this ordeal made him even weaker. In recent years, he suffered from stomach problems, which came and went. However, he always forced himself to work and never slackened. In January of this year, his body finally gave out, and he had to take leave to rest. Unexpectedly, after more than a month of treatment, it was ineffective, and he suddenly passed away on the night of the 25th of this month, at the age of 40. He leaves behind three children. His death is mourned by his colleagues, and the translation community has lost a good talent, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3>Three Suicides</h3>
<p>Social Pathologies... Cause for Concern</p>
<p>Drinking Poison: Gao Chunsheng from Taizhou, 32 years old, ran a mat shop with partners at No. 173, North Henan Road, for many years. Gao was in charge of the shop's affairs. In recent years, the shop's business has been very slow, and they have been experiencing financial difficulties. The day before yesterday, Gao became worried about this and developed suicidal thoughts. After dinner, he secretly swallowed Lysol. His brother, Gao Qinsheng, caught a glimpse of this, but it was too late. He immediately accompanied him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Huishi Police Station, and Detective Sun Changsheng went to investigate and then had the body taken to the Feilun Road morgue for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Hanging: Wang Shanga, a 19-year-old from Nanjing, had been an apprentice at the Shunfuchang coppersmith shop opened by Zhou Shengfu at No. 950, Zhoujiazui Road, for two years. The shop was divided into two sections: copper drawing and coppersmithing. Wang usually worked in the copper drawing section. However, the shop owner, seeing that there were not enough people in the coppersmithing section, transferred Wang to fill the gap. Wang was very dissatisfied with this and became resentful. The morning before last, he suddenly developed suicidal thoughts and, taking advantage of the lack of preparation, went to the workshop and hanged himself. When the shop owner caught a glimpse of this, he immediately cut him down, but it was too late. Only a breath of life remained. He reported it to the Huishan Police Station, and Detective Wang Tongpo went to investigate and took the apprentice to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Swallowing Red Pills: Liu Fenggao from Yancheng, 30 years old, lost his parents when he was young and was raised by his uncle, Chen Shengkang. Chen ran a stove shop at No. 128, Yucai Road, Xiangyan Bridge, for a living. Liu also helped his uncle there. Last year, in November of the lunar calendar, Chen married Sun, a woman from the same town, to Liu. At around 3 AM the day before yesterday, Liu got up for work and asked his wife to bring him a pair of socks to wear. However, she refused, causing an argument. Liu suddenly became resentful of this and developed suicidal thoughts. He went out alone that day, bought two yuan's worth of red pills, brought them back, and secretly swallowed them. When Chen noticed, he transported him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported to the Hongkou Police Station, and Detective Zhang Guisheng went to investigate and then had the body taken to the Feilun Road morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court received a report and appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Wang Zuyi, to come to the morgue and verify that the body was indeed that of Liu. They then ordered the family members to sign separate guarantees and take the body back for burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commercial News Editor Zhang Jiping Applies for Postponement of Trial After Appeal</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiping, the editor-in-chief of Shanghai Commercial News, was sentenced to four months in prison for publishing news about the Xu case. The press believes that once this precedent is set, the consequences will be dire, and they attach great importance to its development. Zhang Jiping, unwilling to accept defeat, has appealed to the First Special District Court, and the trial was scheduled to begin today in the court's First Criminal Chamber. It is now known that Zhang has not yet completed the procedures for hiring a lawyer to defend him. In accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, he submitted a petition yesterday requesting a postponement of the trial.</p>
<h3>Chinese Invent Water-Powered Motor, Foreigners Seek to Acquire It Economically</h3>
<p>The inventor hopes the government will approve it soon</p>
<p>After the successful invention of the water-powered motor (i.e., self-powered engine) by Chinese, it was twice submitted to the central government last year and recently for approval to protect patent rights. Details have been reported in newspapers. Recently, it was rumored that the inventors, Chen Dan and Liang, were planning to cooperate with foreigners or sell the entire machinery to foreigners due to circumstances and economic difficulties. A reporter from the Ri Ri News specifically inquired about Chen and Liang yesterday. According to Mr. Chen, the rumor of cooperating with foreigners was not without reason. Before the motor was successfully invented in the year before last, foreigners had come to discuss buying the drawings at a high price. In the spring of last year, a certain foreigner was willing to provide financial assistance and have the invention rights transferred. However, we were unwilling to let the glory of the Chinese people flow into foreign lands, so we refused sternly. Recently, I was forced by economic circumstances. In the past, I failed more than 100 times in inventing this motor. My personal and family assets have been consumed by no less than tens of thousands. Therefore, I finally submitted it to the government again, requesting assistance and earnestly hoping that the government would reply soon. If the government still hesitates and ignores it, then as a last resort, I may cooperate with foreigners. Recently, foreigners have been coming to the factory preparation office one after another to inquire, which shows that foreigners are paying close attention to this invention.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee of the Journalists Association</h3>
<p>Discusses the Case of Assisting the Ningbo Times Gazette</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held an executive committee meeting at the association's office at 5 PM yesterday. Yu Kongwo, Jiang Jianhou, Ma Chonggan, Jiang Zongyi, Jiang Zongdao, Yan Esheng, Li Zutang, Qian Cangshuo, and others were present. Yu Kongwo chaired the meeting, and Qian Cangshuo recorded the minutes. Regarding the Ningbo Times Gazette's letter stating that the newspaper was warned by the Yin County Party Department and had its newspapers confiscated for publishing news about the Jishēng Association being dissolved, and requesting support, it was resolved that: A. A letter should be sent to the Yin County Party Department requesting cautious handling; B. A letter should be sent to the newspaper expressing sympathy and informing them of the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<h3>The Number of Kerosene Imports in the Last Five Years Is Shocking</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, kerosene is one of the fuels relied upon by families and industries. Since China has no kerosene mines to supply itself, it relies on imports from the United Kingdom and the United States. British Asiatic Petroleum Co., Ltd. and American Mobil Oil Co., Ltd. sell kerosene worth tens of millions of dollars in China every year. After China resumed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the Oil Across the Land Company also competed to dump kerosene in China. Therefore, since 1932, the number of kerosene imports has increased by about onefold compared to five years ago. The statistics of kerosene imports in the last five years are listed below: 1929: 55,177,498 customs taels; 1930: 54,864,546 customs taels; 1931: 64,549,371 customs taels; 1932: 94,244,822 national currency; 1933: 87,450,738 national currency.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Recovers the Right to Supply Electricity to Dinghai Island</h3>
<p>Dinghai Island was originally a beach reclaimed by the Huangpu Bureau. The electricity there was supplied by the Shanghai Electric Company. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities believed that since the area belonged to the Chinese Concession but was supplied with electricity by a foreign company across the border, it was detrimental to sovereignty. After negotiations with the Huangpu Bureau in July 1931, it was changed to Chinese-owned electrical power. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was ordered to lay submarine cables and supply electricity. This equipment project has now been completed, and the company began supplying electricity on January 29th of this year. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has also installed streetlights on the main roads, which residents say is very convenient.</p>
<h3>Residents in the City Center Request Electricity Supply Lines</h3>
<p>No Fees Required</p>
<p>In order to promote the prosperity of the city center, the Shanghai Municipal Government has been making unremitting efforts to promote construction in the area. Regarding electricity supply, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has already agreed with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, which supplies electricity to the area, that no fees will be charged for residents in the area who request electricity supply lines, and the Shanghai Municipal Government will guarantee interest. The method is that the Shanghai Municipal Government will guarantee within five years that the annual electricity fee will be sufficient to cover 12% of the actual construction cost of the lines. If there is a shortfall, the Shanghai Municipal Government will make up for it. Therefore, it is extremely convenient for residents in the area to request electricity supply lines.</p>
<h3>The Mechanical Industry Association Produces and Distributes Safety Warning Posters for Factories</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Chinese Goods Factory Joint Association recently noted that it is not possible for factories to improve safety equipment without sufficient financial resources and talent. However, it is easy for factories to hang special signs in machine rooms, raw material rooms, and manufacturing rooms to warn workers to avoid major disasters caused by carelessness. Thousands of iron signs have been produced with warning words such as "Beware of Fire" and "Beware of Danger," as well as simple and easy-to-understand designs of skull and bones, etc. They have begun printing and will be distributed to member factories to reduce disasters.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Gang Resists Price Increases of Various Ships, Plans to Suspend Commercial Goods for Two Months</h3>
<p>New Alliance Charter of Various Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Trial Run for Two Months After Signing</p>
<p>The Sichuan River shipping companies in Shanghai are proceeding with a cooperative alliance to increase water freight by 100%, which has aroused the opposition of the entire Sichuan Gang, preparing for two months of sacrifice to resist the various Sichuan ships. The alliance contract has been signed. The reporter will investigate and report the follow-up news of this matter as follows:</p>
<h3>Chinese Ships Suffer Losses in Cooperation</h3>
<p>The initiators of this Sichuan River shipping alliance are Jiangjiang, Taikoo, Minsheng, and Jardine Matheson, while Sanbei and Guangyao have also joined the scope of this cooperation. At that time, the Chinese shipping companies proposed that the Wukui Line and Wanxian Port business has always been operated only by Chinese ships, and foreign ships are not allowed to go there, and British ships cannot sail to Wanxian. The business in these two places is usually not included in the scope of public sharing. This time, the representatives of the various companies in Shanghai agreed on the same, and Wanxian Wukui was also included in the public sharing regulations. The contract has been signed. According to people in the Shanghai shipping industry, except for Minsheng, the Chinese shipping companies have suffered losses in this Sichuan shipping alliance. The normally profitable Wukui Wanhang business has also been publicly allocated, which is not in the interest of Chinese ships.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Did Not Join</h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau originally had a ship, the Emei, in the Sichuan River. Since it had an accident in July of last year, it has not been salvaged. The reefs on the bottom of the ship have been blasted. After the spring flood, it is hoped that it can be towed to Shanghai for major repairs. Since the Emei accident, the China Merchants Bureau has not had any ships running in the Sichuan River. Even if the Emei is repaired, it will be changed to the Jinghan express line. There will be no ships running in the Sichuan River for the time being. Therefore, the China Merchants Bureau did not join this alliance cooperation.</p>
<h3>Alliance to Trial Run for Two Months</h3>
<p>The alliance contract has been signed by various public companies such as Jiangjiang, Minsheng, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, and Guangyao. The freight for loading goods is increased by 100% according to the original price rate. Cotton has been increased to 24 yuan per piece. Piece goods and other goods must be increased to 80 yuan per ton. The weight and size of other groceries are particularly serious. The increase in the price of goods this time is really unexpected. The shipping companies believe that the atmosphere of the merchants is not good, so they have decided to implement the alliance for two months on a trial basis.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Gang Prepares to Sacrifice</h3>
<p>The various merchants of the Sichuan Gang in Shanghai believe that the increase in freight by the shipping companies this time is too great. After repeated meetings, it was agreed that the actual receipt for each piece of cotton was only eight yuan, and now it has increased by two-thirds. Groceries must also be charged according to gross weight, which is too much of a loss. They have repeatedly requested a reduction, but it has been rejected by the shipping companies. The various merchants of the Sichuan Gang have jointly decided that during the two-month trial period of this newly established alliance, they will bear the pain and suspend the business of commercial goods entering Sichuan for two months. After the two-month period expires, if the shipping companies can improve the methods, they will resume commercial transportation at that time. Otherwise, they will discuss a proper strategy.</p>
<h3>Rent Dispute in Xicheng Lane, French Concession</h3>
<p>The City Federation Branch Issued a Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>Announcing a Rent Reduction for All</p>
<p>Due to opposition from tenants of Xicheng Lane on Malong Road in the French Concession against the landlord's imposition of harsh contracts, a large number of tenants were subjected to property seizures, causing public outrage. The Xicheng Lane Branch of the Fourth District Division of the Shanghai Special District Second City Federation was organized to collectively respond to the situation. Yesterday, they issued a declaration, tearfully pleading for assistance from all sectors. They also notified everyone to abide by the proposed rent reduction measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>To All Organizations and Citizens of All Roads and Lanes in This City:</p>
<p>We are writing to inform you that our members all reside in houses in Xicheng Lane on Malong Road in the French Concession. These houses belong to the former General Commander of the Five Provinces Allied Forces, Sun Chuanfang, and their rental management has long been entrusted to the Yipin Bank. The tenants have lived here peacefully for eight years. Unexpectedly, the owner recently transferred the rental management rights to himself, under the name of Yiyuan Company. In January, they notified the tenants and imposed an illegal, one-sided contract. At the same time, rental collectors were forcing the collection of rent managed by Yipin, not allowing any arrears. Since the January 28th Incident, many tenants have had rent arrears of two or three months due to the economic downturn. The landlord ignored everything and insisted on full payment, using extremely aggressive methods. As a result, many tenants had to sell or pawn their belongings to pay. However, a few tenants who rely on their daily income for survival and are now facing the Lunar New Year season find it difficult to repay immediately. Even after pleading with the rental collectors for time or offering to pay half, they were ignored. Without providing written notices or summonses to the court, the landlord resorted to his old tricks of military oppression, falsely suing the tenants in court and implementing provisional attachment, sealing the houses of thirteen tenants. Amidst the current rent reduction movement, the landlord has uniquely created an illegal rental contract to revise rental prices and satisfy his desire to increase rent. He has also imposed harsh conditions, allowing arbitrary eviction. The tenants, unable to withstand this oppression, have no choice but to unite to seek common security. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will empathize with our plight, uphold justice, and provide assistance. Society will be fortunate. We hereby issue this declaration, hoping for your public consideration.</p>
<h3>Notice to All</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of issuing a notice: Our association has been established, and executive officers have been elected to be responsible for handling negotiations. From now on, this association will implement resolutions separately based on decisions made at general meetings. The matters that must be observed and noted are hereby notified as follows: (1) Do not privately sign any illegal contracts with the landlord. If a contract has already been signed, report it to this association for a declaration of invalidity. If a contract has not been signed, submit the contract to this association. (2) The rent reduction issue in this lane will follow the rent reduction measures resolved by the Shanghai Rent Reduction Association, paying rent at 80% of the original amount. Until a satisfactory resolution is reached, all rents should be deposited individually at the Continental Bank on Xiafei Road to prevent the landlord from using it as an excuse. (3) Print rent investigation forms and covenants, and each person should fill them out and sign them. (4) If there is any oppression by the landlord, please report it to this association immediately for negotiation. (5) Everyone must strictly comply with the above measures without error. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>Results of the Preliminary Examination for Clerks at the First Special Court Announced</h3>
<p>Oral Re-examination Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court, in order to reserve recording talent, held a clerk examination on the 21st of this month. The court session that day in which the candidates recorded a mock trial, was reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the president of the court, Guo, sent letters to various universities in Shanghai beforehand, requesting each to recommend law graduates with excellent academic records to take the exam at the court, and also encouraged court recorders with appointed official qualifications who were willing to practice recording to take the test. Therefore, no public announcement was made for the examination. As for the examination method, in addition to recording court testimony during trial, candidates were also given a Chinese composition topic. The test papers were sealed and distributed, and candidates were instructed to write an essay. Members of the Examination Committee have now unsealed the papers, graded them, and tallied the scores. A total of eighteen candidates recommended by various universities were examined, and the following nine were selected: Zeng Lan'ying, Wang Nengze, Cheng Dacheng, Han Shuzhi, Wang Zhaozheng, Gao Minghe, Cai Tianduo, Cheng Huarui, and Chen Quan. Eleven court recorders took the test, and the following three were selected: Ying Yeping, Jin Shixiang, and Wu Bingzhang. The results were announced by Court President Guo yesterday, and all those selected were instructed to report to the court at 2:00 PM yesterday to undergo an oral re-examination. Those who pass the re-examination will be notified separately to report for duty after another announcement.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongdao, a Muslim Student Returning From Turkey, Will Tour and Lecture</h3>
<p>Ma Hongdao, a Muslim (i.e., Islamic) student who has completed his studies in Turkey and returned to China, made the following statement yesterday: There are many "Islamic" Muslims in our country, and there are also many famous scholars. However, due to the oppression of autocratic emperors, the thinking of "Islamic" Muslims has changed. It seems that the country is the country, and religion is religion. They still have a twelve-point faith in religion, but they have an indifferent attitude towards the country. As long as I can live, no matter what happens to the country, it is up to fate. This kind of psychology of believing in religion but not loving the country is a big mistake. We should expand the psychology of believing in religion and extend it to the country. If we only care about religion and not the country, it is like the Buddhist places where chanting scriptures and praying are the way of life. Their cultural decline has reached its extreme, which looks very dangerous. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People ultimately lead to government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and even to the path of a world commonwealth. This is to teach all Chinese people to do Chinese affairs together, to start with local autonomy and extend it to party affairs and government. Muhammad said in his holy decree, "Love of country is a part of faith." The Quran says, "Do not shed blood on the ground." In other words, Muhammad taught us to love our country, which is to be a complete Muslim. The deep meaning of the Quran is to teach us not to kill each other, but to pay attention to group life and go to the path of perfection. All "Islamic" Muslims are based on abiding by the Holy Decree and the Quran. Saying this, we will certainly correct the wrong psychology, eliminate foreign troubles, and eradicate internal worries. We must fight with the spirit of Turkey and Germany. In our country, there are "Islamic" Muslims with this kind of spirit, such as Zheng He of the former Ming Dynasty, Zuo Baogui and Ma Fulu of the former Qing Dynasty, and An Dexin, who passed away not long ago. These people all showed great fearless spirit and sacrificed themselves to win glory for the nation. Having seen this, Hongdao returned to China and gathered three or five like-minded people, hoping to visit all the religious relatives in the country in person after returning to China, planning to start from Nanjing, go north through Tianjin-Pukou, then go south through Pinghan, and return to Beijing along the Yangtze River, making a small-scale tour. On the one hand, he will offer his experiences to the religious compatriots, and on the other hand, he wants to know the current situation of the religious compatriots in various places. Since we are a nation in the world, the Chinese nation, we should rise up and cooperate so that we will not be oppressed by others. I hope that you religious relatives will help and guide as much as possible with everything you hope for.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association</h3>
<p>There are no fewer than 200,000 Shandong natives residing in Shanghai, but there has never been an organization for fellow-provincials. Zhang Jinhu, Gao Shikui, Ma Dengying, Ma Jintang, Zhang Shuixiu, Dong Pingyu, Zi Zhihe, Zhang Xiangyun, and other elders from Shandong residing in Shanghai believe that since there are so many fellow-provincials in Shanghai, it is necessary to have a fellow-provincial organization. They have now connected with more than thirty fellow-provincials and initiated the organization of the Shandong Shanghai Fellow-Provincials Association. They have held several meetings to discuss preparatory matters, and the procedures are complete. Last night, they held a banquet at the Daya Building on Fourth Horse Road, where more than one hundred fellow-provincials gathered to talk and rejoice, which was a grand occasion. It is said that the association will soon submit a request to the City Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for registration and announce its establishment. It is expected that the association will benefit the Shandong fellow-provincials residing in Shanghai in the future, which is not a small thing.</p>
<h3>The Coffin Transporters of the Warehouse Industry Association Transported Coffins for Burial</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Warehouse Industry Public Righteousness Association has been collecting and burying exposed corpses and donating coffins for many years, reaching thousands each year. It has also established the Chengxian Obligation Primary School and provides tea and medicine in the summer and autumn seasons. It has always been supported by all sectors, resulting in remarkable achievements. This spring, the association is once again due for burial. Yesterday, it hired four large trucks to transport thirty-eight large coffins and more than 1,100 exposed coffins from the association's location on Tianbao Road to the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou, where they were loaded onto two large ships and transported to the Hangzhou Yishan for burial.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Futong Institute Actively Preparing to Build a New Clubhouse</h3>
<p>Construction Scheduled to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Futong Institute, located at 855 North Sichuan Road in this city, has recently expanded its business, and its original clubhouse is no longer sufficient. Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, and others, the presidents of the institute, recognizing this situation, convened a general committee meeting at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. Those present included Li Denghui, Lin Wojiang, Zhu Lide, Lin Tianhe, Xie Songgao, Wu Xiaogu, Wu Shoudao, and Mrs. He Linyi. Chairman Li Denghui first had Director-General Cai Shoudao report on the institute's achievements in the past month, and Accountant Wu Xiaogu report on the accounts. Then, the amendment of the articles of association and the construction of a new clubhouse were discussed. A construction committee was established on the spot, and Li Denghui, Xie Songgao, Wu Xiaogu, and Cai Shoudao were elected as members, responsible for planning everything. It is said that as a result, it was decided to proceed actively, and construction drawings have been drafted. The site at Qujia Bridge on Jiangwan Road has also been measured once, and construction is scheduled to begin next month.</p>
<h3>Five-Year Patent for Glass Soap</h3>
<p>The glass soap invented by Mr. Lin Yanfu, manager of the Shanghai Haiyuan Manufacturing Company, can be used to wipe glass and hardware, making them bright and convenient. It is also economical.

<p>Reading Q &amp; A</p>
<h3>Where Should One Start When Studying International Issues? (1)</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>How fortunate I am to have found reading guidance in the mist! Therefore, I dare to present the questions I have accumulated over time to you gentlemen, hoping that you will provide open and concrete answers.</p>
<p>Before presenting my questions, I should briefly describe my life to seek your guidance. I am the son of a businessman, and also engaged in agriculture as a sideline. In recent years, affected by the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the business closed down long ago, and the land was also sold. What was originally more than twenty acres is now used to maintain life, which is the old debt remaining after the business closed down; therefore, the issue of livelihood is a problem that I urgently need to solve. I am currently a third-year student in a normal school's advanced program. The pain of unemployment is approaching, so my future is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, this is who I am. Next, I will talk about what I like to study. Although I am involved in normal school, I like to study international issues. The purpose is to explore the dynamic questions of international politics and economics from practical problems, in order to recognize future trends. However, I do not like foreign languages and have no knowledge of economics.</p>
<p>The materials I used to study were of two types, namely reading newspapers and various magazines. I am well aware that these two materials are very lacking, but I have no suitable person to guide me and am restricted by economic conditions, so I cannot buy more complete and expensive books, so I have to do it this way, until now, two difficulties have arisen: the information published in newspapers is unsystematic, and I cannot find the main factors causing certain problems, only the arrangement of some facts, and the truth is still questionable. (2) Reading magazines is also full of hearsay, and there is very little volatilization about the inside of the facts, and the reasons they hold are not much different, the only difference is the order of publication, the issue of time. These two mistakes prove that the price I paid for the time I spent before was empty! At the same time, I also feel the difficulty of cognitive ability. This has to be a reorganization, so the following questions arise:</p>
<p>A. Should a person in my living situation study international issues? Can I study it?</p>
<p>B. Where should one start when studying international issues?</p>
<p>C. How can I develop correct cognitive ability?</p>
<p>D. Can a person who does not understand foreign languages and has no knowledge of economics satisfy my desire to study international issues? If not, how can I satisfy it?</p>
<p>E. If I want to study economics, where should I start?</p>
<p>The above questions all urgently need your concrete answers. I can only wait for your instructions.</p>

<h3>Three Regrets</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Song Yu Wenbao said: "I have three regrets, one is no son, two is no help, and three is no accomplishment. Holding this bitter heart, I entertain myself with words. I have already stopped writing in this record, and I will sing long to tie it together. It is laughable that spring silkworms are so foolish, working hard every year for others? It is just like a poor woman flying her shuttle, and she has never had anything to wear." This was inscribed on the back of his book "Blowing Sword Record." It was honest in his original intention. Only with these three regrets could the "Blowing Sword Record" be written. If he had a son, help, and accomplishment, I am afraid there would be no "Blowing Sword Record." Without the "Blowing Sword Record," who would know that there was a Yu Wenbao? So he said three regrets, I think it can be without regrets, because people leave a name after death, leopards leave their skin after death, abundant in this, stingy in that, why not be content with yourself?</p>
<p>Moreover, the three regrets he said are not enough to be considered regrettable, because Han Tuozhou said: "Gaining an official position satisfies everything, and having no son is easy for one's body." If the son is unfilial and brings shame to his parents, it is certainly regrettable. Even from breastfeeding to getting married, it takes a lot of trouble and hard work, which may not be pleasant. As for no help, it is probably because there are no close friends. Someone used to say, "Having a confidant can be without regrets." The help of friends is indeed indispensable in life. However, in addition to the help of friends, there are other aids, or beyond friends, such as the most authoritative and powerful attraction that is enough to influence the world. Mr. Yu's regret of no help, I do not know whether it includes all these aids. With help, it is easy to have accomplishments, so his third regret and second regret are mutually reinforcing. Taking a step back, Mr. Yu's words have been passed down to this day, which can be considered an accomplishment. This shows that his three regrets are really nothing to regret, what regrets are there!</p>
<p>The poor woman flies the shuttle, without a single thread, but it is the most common view of life, whether there are sons, help, or accomplishments, in the end there is still nothing. Materialist historians can see through it, like the predecessors said, "Have wine today, get drunk today, worry about tomorrow without money." Only today, without asking about tomorrow, is a great thought, and this thought is also the motor of all careers." Qian Muzhai took off his boots and wanted to throw himself into the water to die for his country, but he felt too cold, so he shrank his feet and stood up, wearing simple clothes and carrying food and drink to welcome the king's army. He has a concept of tomorrow in his heart.</p>
<p>Today, there is nothing else to regret, only one regret, which is the same in everyone's heart, is "no money." Even those who have money still regret that they don't have enough, or they and those who really have no money hold the same regret for the rest of their lives.</p>
<h3>Losing a Son</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yun</p>
<p>"Nothing is more heartbreaking than losing a son," this is indeed true, I really feel it now.</p>
<p>A good and healthy child is suddenly lost, after his parents have raised him for many years, kissed him, and regarded him as a second life, how heartbroken must the parents be?</p>
<p>Therefore, I just want to write out the following facts. In fact, my mood is under this great blow, and I cannot summarize this chaotic situation.</p>
<p>When the child's face turned pale and his body temperature gradually dropped, his mother still did not know to give up trying to save this little life, and tried her best to pray for God's blessing. Seeing this miserable and pitiful scene, I had to tell my wife: "The child is finished."</p>
<p>My wife woke up as if from a big dream, and at the same time screamed and fell into another dream, stiffly falling on the floor. At this time, the muscles all over my body were also soft and limp. Regret, decadence, sadness, and pain all came together. After rational control one by one, I took care of the child's funeral and comforted my wife, and then I was taken by my friends to the road for a walk.</p>
<p>The defect of mood cannot be compensated. This stimulation has completely submerged my heart. I don't believe that this healthy child is lost. I think this is a dream. When I wake up, my good child still exists. Who can believe that this healthy child will die? Who can believe it?</p>
<p>In this way, whether I am walking, sitting, or sleeping, as long as I am surrounded by a quiet space alone, this thought will come: "My child is not dead, right?" If reason tells me the truth, a chill will come and suffocate this thought. However, what follows is the trembling of the heart and the constant reflection of the child's life fragments.</p>
<p>The child is dead, and all the child's actions have become the object of remembrance. And my child, he is equipped with health and wisdom, so his actions are even more called me to remember, and my pain of losing a son is naturally strengthened.</p>
<p>Before, I had comforted my friend: "What does it matter to lose a child?" If someone comforts me like this now, I will definitely give him a strong revulsion, seeing that life must be experienced.</p>
<p>I have deeply tasted the grief of losing a son, so I know that the heartache of a person who loses a son cannot be matched by any other tragedy.</p>

<h3>Whenever a New Book is Bought</h3>
<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>New clothes are lovely, because after all, they are different from old clothes, and they can add a lot of spirit invisibly! As the saying goes: "People depend on clothes, horses depend on saddles!" Although divine steeds are trapped between troughs and stables, but "thousand-mile horses are often available, but Bole is not often available!" Like Wang Meng, who "wore rough clothes to visit, and talked while stroking lice" to Fu Jian, and Fan Wenzhenggong, who "the scholars changed their clothes to come out, but Zhongyan was as usual," how many people can there be in the world who are indifferent to material things and do not pay attention to appearance? It is enough to see that new clothes are universal and valuable!</p>
<p>The spiritual food of life - new books, are also like this!</p>
<p>Of course, opening the books, both Chinese and foreign, there are many smart and wise geniuses and what prodigies, however, without new books as a fuse, how can they ignite their dazzling sparks of knowledge, how can they develop their great mines of thought fuel?</p>
<p>Loving new books, buying new books, I have simply become a habit: if I have two smelly copper coins by my side, I will buy them all when I go to the bookstore; sometimes when I see a new book, I don't have money to buy it, I always go home with infinite sadness; but whenever I get a new book:</p>
<p>(1) First, I roughly flip through it with my eyes, to see if the words are beautiful? Are the illustrations exquisite? Or is the printing and binding solid and beautiful? Conduct a second aesthetic review, and then multiply and divide it with the price.</p>
<p>(2) Look at the catalog, how is the outline? How are the details? Close the book and think silently: What is the content of this book? (Actually, you don't need to close your eyes!) Guess the riddle once or twice.</p>
<p>(3) In the beginning of the new book, or the beginning of each chapter, first look at the first paragraph, and then cover it up and think about what kind of theories will be in the following; it seems that this book is my teacher, sitting upright and examining me orally.</p>
<p>(4) Like the third view, but turn the head around, first look at the lower paragraph, and then think about what is the meaning of the upper paragraph? In this way, after reading half a paragraph and thinking about half a paragraph. At first, nine out of ten guesses are wrong, but later they are still pertinent; I feel very rich and interesting, and get the benefit of observation invisibly.</p>
<p>(5) Sometimes I read a few paragraphs of a new book and insert it on the bookshelf, it is simply: "There are those who cannot see each other for thirty-six years!"</p>
<p>The above is my treatment method for new books I bought; may I ask another unfamiliar self-taught comrade how to deal with newly bought books?</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Fourth: Drinking Wine and Passing Food, Reveling and Containing Farewell Tears, Burning the Lamp to Warm the Dream, Singing Softly to Spend the Long Night</p>
<p>As Guizhi spoke, she took the noodles to the kitchen. On the small coal stove, there was a kettle, and the kettle was tinkling, almost ready to boil, so she sat on a low chair by the stove, quietly waiting for the water to boil. Half-sideways, she propped her head with one hand and looked at the flame diagonally. I don't know why, a burst of heartache, two lines of tears rolled straight down from her pink face. She was staring at the fire in a daze, even though tears were streaming down her cheeks, she didn't care, just staring in a daze. Only when the boiling water rushed the pot lid, and with a puff, splashed the flames and released green flames, did she wake up in shock, quickly wipe away her tears, and carry the kettle into the room. As soon as she stepped into the room, she smiled at Ziqiang: If I'm not here to support you, you can't sing, right? Ziqiang smiled: My play, I can only sing and listen to myself. Guizhi made tea, cleaned up the bowls and chopsticks, took Ziqiang's hand, and sat down on a chair together. She smiled and said: I have a fresh little song, called "Persuading Husband to Improve," sing it for you to listen to, okay? Ziqiang held her hand with one hand and patted the back of her hand with the other, and said with a smile: Good, good, good! You just sing it. If I have anything to improve, after listening to your words, I can also improve it. Guizhi took two sips of the teacup, put down the teacup, smiled slightly at Ziqiang, and was about to open her mouth to sing, when suddenly a burst of alarm clock sounds came from the clothes on the hanger. Guizhi's face suddenly changed, and she grasped Ziqiang's hand and looked at his face. Ziqiang said: What time did you set the alarm clock to? Guizhi answered in a very miserable voice: It was originally set at five thirty. Ziqiang stood up and said: I have to leave at six o'clock, I can only delay half an hour. Go and wake up the old master and your old lady, right? Guizhi just held her husband's hand, how could she answer a word? (322)</p>
<p>New Invention</p>
<h3>Proof of Kerosene Curing Lung Disease (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Kawasaki's workers, once drank fifty grams of it, and there was no harm, but according to the actual experiment, after the first drink, there will probably be diarrhea side effects, and also because the amount is too much, there will also be sore throat and hoarseness. But this phenomenon is temporary, and it will recover immediately after stopping. Especially when diarrhea occurs, according to the experimenters; it can increase appetite and refresh the mind. As for the type of kerosene, any kind can be drunk. It is always better to use second-class oil, too high-quality and gasoline volatile oil (gasoline) must never be taken.</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Iwamoto Yoshitora, Doctor of Science at the Osaka Municipal Industrial Research Institute, proved the effectiveness of kerosene in curing lung diseases. He said: People with insufficient knowledge think that kerosene is poisonous. For more than ten years, in relation to the research on oil, I have long believed that kerosene is the most effective medicine for treating lung diseases. Kerosene is extracted from hundreds of feet underground, and the cause of kerosene has not been determined, but it is believed to be an animal source. We decompose the corpses of fish and other animals that lived in ancient times, eliminating proteins and water-containing carbon, and its fat can be divided into fatty acids and glycerin. Fatty acids are insoluble in water and accumulate in one place, so if they are decomposed again, they will turn into kerosene. If you analyze the salt water of the oil well, the thermal decomposition of fish oil, kerosene contains the same fatty acids as fish oil. Today, kerosene is made from soybean oil and fish oil. I personally separated four and five tenths of a kerosene from one liter of fish oil. This kind of kerosene is also found in the animal and vegetable oils that we eat in our daily diet. Moreover, people in the cold zone in Siberia often drink kerosene. The kerosene punging used in medical treatment is used for disinfection, washing, or scabies and insect repellent. As for internal use, medical books are used as a medicine for abnormal fermentation of the stomach and chronic intestinal catarrh, which is injected into capsules for internal use. (0.3 grams to 0.9 grams per day) We often see kerosene emulsions, which are strong medicines for killing bacteria and insects. This is made by adding an emulsifier to kerosene and stirring. The kerosene becomes very small microparticles, which do not hinder plants and achieve the purpose of killing insects. Thinking this way, kerosene entering the human body is certainly not harmful. Drinking kerosene allows the strong bactericide contained in kerosene to be absorbed into the human body's tissues and circulate throughout the body. Especially when it reaches the affected area in the body, it can exert its bactericidal effect. Furthermore, the food we take in our daily life contains fat and salt. When it reaches the stomach and intestines, due to subtle physiological effects, it forms a soapy state. Because of its strong emulsification, it turns nutrients that are difficult to absorb into emulsions, so that the absorption from the intestinal wall can easily take effect. Therefore, drinking kerosene is not only rich in penetration, but also forms water and emulsions. The kerosene emulsion formed in this way is absorbed from the intestinal tract of the digestive system, enters the blood, and circulates throughout the body. This kerosene, after being used, must be excreted in the urine of the drinker, or seep out from the skin. Judging from this fact, kerosene reaches the lungs, and accompanied by the respiratory function of the lungs, causes the tuberculosis bacteria in the affected area to take effect, so as to eliminate them. I once drank one hundred grams of kerosene continuously, and there was no harm. I also explained in detail the points that I believed to friends who suffered from lung disease, and they also automatically drank it. After that, their results were excellent. However, in order to promote the cause of patients with chronic diseases in society, I often advertise in newspapers and magazines. In the past year, three or four thousand people have directly asked me about the drinking method. Most of these three or four thousand people suffer from lung disease, and most of them are close to the third stage. Because I cannot answer each letter one by one, I specially used a mimeograph to print out the kerosene treatment for lung disease instructions and send them to the questioners. Now, almost all over Japan are drinking it. After they get my instructions, they drink and recover according to the law. It can be said that they are successful. Therefore, letters thanking me fly like mold. A few months ago, a doctor seriously opposed me, saying "Kerosene entering the body of a weak lung disease patient has a hundred harms and no benefits, and it is a violation of the medical profession for people other than doctors to advocate drinking kerosene."</p>

<h3>Bat</h3>
<p>— Weiming</p>
<p>There used to be such a story: birds and beasts formed groups and fought each other, and there was a kind of bat in between. After the birds won, they flew to the birds, boasting that they had wings and could fly; when the beasts won, they climbed to the beasts, boasting that they could walk, and it was considered a beast. Later, the two realized this, reconciled, and jointly killed the bat. This story can be easily found in elementary school textbooks.</p>
<p>This bat can be considered absurd! At the same time, it is also very funny! It is too lacking. At most, it can only see the direction of the wind and join the victorious group. First: it cannot sing the praises of the victor's merits and expound the reasons why the other party should fail. Second: it cannot think of ways to make the birds and beasts fight forever, so as to obtain many benefits. Third: it cannot be impartial and detached from both, and of course, it can also obtain more benefits.</p>
<p>Humans are the spirit of all things, so their ideas are better than bats. The ancients watched snakes fight and realized the principle of cursive calligraphy, and even learned health preservation from turtles. The so-called Tao follows nature, and humans have learned quite a few methods from the natural world. However, bats are not as good as people, and they really should learn from people: for example, A and B fighting each other can be considered a war; C living in the middle, uniting A to attack B or uniting B to attack A can be considered politics; saying the reason why B or A should be beaten can be considered an ism. So many past facts are history... Reasoning down like this, you will know that "the world is nothing more than that." This is where humans are far superior to animals.</p>
<p>Many of the so-called conspirators in the world are actually "sun" schemes. The art of vertical and horizontal manipulation was popular for a while in ancient times, but it seems to be nothing more than that. Because no matter how you use your wrists and scheming, being in the position of an onlooker but actually being the initiator can be "yin"; but it is inevitable to have an effect, and if there is an effect, there will be facts, and this will all be expressed, inevitably "yang." For example, standing on a scale to measure weight, standing lightly or standing hard is really no different, the weight is the same. Even if the cause and effect are mixed, there is no reversal, and whatever the original shape is, it will eventually be clear. Although Su and Zhang are strategists, no one in ancient and modern times has felt that they have anything other than being strategists. Even if they manage to make the birds and beasts fight forever, they themselves are nothing more than "bats."</p>
<p>Only by thinking this way is there some hope in the world. No matter how dark it is, truth is still truth, and light is still light. Spies have never served as emperors, and hooligans have never become poets. Just look at those people's faces that are so "憔悴深顰," and you can know that there are still "humanity" and "conscience" and the like pressing on them, which is better than the torture in hell.</p>
<h3>Snow Pig</h3>
<p>— He Yitian</p>
<p>In Xikang, there is an animal, short and no more than two chi long, with light yellow-black fur, resembling a civet, but with a short tail. It walks on its hind legs, while its front legs are held in front of its neck, as if making an arch. It seems to murmur something in its mouth, and people say it is chanting scriptures. It often walks back and forth in the snow, with its tail tucked in and shaking its head. As soon as it sees people, it burrows into a hole. People call it "snow pig." There is a kind of oil inside its belly, white, which can be used to treat frostbite. Perhaps it is because it murmurs in its mouth, it is very peaceful, often making an arch and offering no resistance, being caught from its hole and having its belly cut open with a shiny knife, while it still seems to murmur in its mouth.</p>
<p>This creature is abundant on the west bank of the Jinsha River in Xikang. However, that place is already the territory of Tibetan soldiers led by British officers. In the past, when I was in Batang, I often suffered from frostbite, and hearing that the oil of this animal was very effective, I was always looking for it through people. Once, I met a representative of the thirty-ninth tribe who had his nose cut off by Tibetan soldiers. I thought he would definitely have a solution, but as soon as I mentioned the west bank of the Jinsha River, he shed tears and wiped his eyes. It is said that they are also Han Chinese, who have lived in Tibet for several generations. But as soon as the Tibetan soldiers arrived, they had their noses cut off under the command of British officers, and were forced to flee the Jinsha River. I was afraid he would say more, so I seized an opportunity to ask him if snow pigs were easy to find. But he shook his head at me, seemingly indicating that his family had been destroyed, so how could he talk about snow pigs! He told me that within the Tibetan soldiers' territory, Han people were only allowed to leave, not to enter. When he mentioned this, his face showed an angry expression. Really! His answer was irrelevant! I had no choice but to stand aside, looking from the silver box containing the Buddha statue hanging on his chest to the shallow, festering root of his nose, which was moving slightly. He looked up at the sky, and it seemed that he was murmuring something in his mouth again.</p>
<p>It is said that they had resisted before, perhaps because they were always murmuring in their mouths, they finally peacefully and without resistance allowed the shiny knife to cut off their noses, just like the snow pigs, still murmuring in their mouths.</p>
<p>I am very fortunate, fortunate that I am not on the west bank of the Jinsha River, and not to be cut off my nose; and even more fortunate, thinking that I was born in the mainland that has received the baptism of science, not to be cut off my nose while murmuring in my mouth. Although I am always somewhat apprehensive, I always think that there will be such a day. As soon as I left Xikang, I forgot about it. But now I am worried again: now many people are not playing with prayer beads and murmuring in their mouths again? And recently, many people who think they understand science have also started playing with prayer beads and murmuring in their mouths, and even seem to want to make it a universal trend as if it were a serious matter. During this so-called "national crisis," when foreign command knives are flying everywhere, I am very worried, not afraid of having my nose cut off, but afraid that when being cut, I can only murmur in my mouth.</p>
<p>"There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart!" I don't know why, I thought of that snow pig walking on the snow, making an arch.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Poetry from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Xie Maoqin, the "minor poet" of the Ming Dynasty, once said that poetry should avoid vulgar and ugly words, but when used by the right person, adorned with beauty, they can still make for fine lines. It is like a wealthy family's kitchen, where wild vegetables are obtained and seasoned with various flavors, creating a unique taste that is very different from that of a poor family. He also said that the word "blood" is rarely used in poetry, as its use tends to be vulgar and ugly. However, Li Changji's "White Tiger March" says, "Dragon robes stained with Jing Ke's blood." And Gu Buweng's "Song of the Green Bamboo Whip" says, "The fresh green seems dyed with Chang Hong's blood." These two masters are skilled in phrasing, requiring no seasoning; how can wild vegetables have flavor?</p>
<p>I occasionally write poetry, without caring to distinguish the elegance or ugliness of the words, and I also like to use the word "blood." I once sent a seven-character律诗 to Huang Zhigang, which was published in the "Tao Sheng Weekly," with the lines, "Bitter words can be written mixed with blood, smiling faces are rarely seen without a frown." And seven years ago, lamenting the novelist Luo Heizhi, there were also the lines, "I wish to write a hundred thousand words, to carve out my liver and pour out my blood to tell of grievances." Heizhi was once implicated in a certain suspicion and imprisoned for more than a month. Although he was later released after the truth came to light, he ultimately died of grief and indignation. If the minor poet were to see this use of the word "blood," would he still say it is vulgar and ugly, unadorned, like wild vegetables requiring no seasoning?</p>
<p>In the spring of 1928, I and a certain gentleman were working at a certain art academy. He had no tolerance for alcohol but liked to drink yellow wine, and he had no addiction to opium but liked to smoke it. Was he perhaps what is called a heartbroken man with hidden feelings? One day, he said that he was going back to Jiangyin. I thought of Jiangyin as the hometown of Zhou Shuiping, a former professor at Shanghai University. Zhou was killed by Sun Chuanfang, a warlord of the Northern Warlords, for a certain crime, and Wu Zhihui wrote an essay to express his indignation, saying, "Is it feared not to be red, so it is dyed with blood?" This was published in the "Yu Si Weekly." Moved by the times and saddened by events, I wrote a poem to send to the gentleman, and had already drafted it, but a friend saw it and said that the gentleman was returning home to marry a wife, so I destroyed it. The poem reads:</p>
<p>The red land is stained without cause? The birds sing mournfully in spring.</p>
<p>Amidst the bloody wind and rain, I return to mourn Zhou Shuiping in Jiangyin!</p>
<p>If it is said that literature is a tool for venting indignation and proclaiming grief, then in terms of poetry, Qu Yuan, Du Fu, and Wu Meicun should be considered the three greatest writers in our country, and even the poems of Lu You and Yuan Yishan are still considered too weak. With the talent and character of these three masters, they were indeed exceptional, but they happened to live in difficult times, and expressed their poignant words, which is why they are unique throughout the ages. During the reign of Emperor Wuzong of Ming, Zheng Shanfu wrote poetry emulating Du Fu, with many generous and emotional works. Lin Zhenheng, who compiled the Fuzhou Gazetteer, criticized him for not being in the Tianbao era, and for being far from picking up what others left behind, and for groaning without illness. I also have a habit of groaning, but what is the nature of my illness is still waiting to be diagnosed. What I can be sure of is that life is finite, and my strength is very limited, so I am afraid that I cannot seep my blood and tears into the ink, and convey them through my pen!</p>
<h3>A Comedy of Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>("The Triumph of Medicine." A Three-Act Comedy. By Jules Romains of France. Translated by Li Liewen. Published by The Commercial Press.)</p>
<p>I really don't know what to call this kind of work, whether "a comedy of tragedy" or "a tragedy of comedy" is more appropriate?</p>
<p>What I mean is this: we often see many books that are defined as comedies, and on the surface, they do indeed have a bit of a humorous flavor, often providing readers with laughter. But all true art cannot take laughter as its ultimate goal. In the midst of laughter, the author always intentionally or unintentionally hints at a problem, or expresses a reality. From the perspective of the purpose of art, it is no different from tragedy. Many young people or shallow people highly worship tragedy and despise comedy, because they cannot understand the origin of true comedy.</p>
<p>Many comedies often give a dim ending amidst laughter, leaving the reader with a heavier heart than a tragedy. This is true depression, which is different from the effect of tragedy. Tragedy gives a sweet aftertaste in the unfortunate ending of an event; while comedy often shows the true foolishness and evil deeds of human beings from dry reality. It is like a mirror, making a certain kind of person, often many kinds of people, see the ugliness they have always hidden. Therefore, the writing methods of tragedy and comedy are also different. Tragedy goes from poetry to poetry, while comedy goes from prose to poetry; although comedy only has poetic lyricism in the last moment, that power can sometimes surpass everything that tragedy can give. Naturally, due to the different temperaments of people, the views on tragedy and comedy are also different, and I also have no intention of despising tragedy. On the contrary, the comedy that I love to read is precisely because it is not just a comedy, it can be called a "comedy of tragedy." This point needs to be understood. Those comedies that start with laughter and end with laughter, and tell us nothing from laughter, are shallow comedies.</p>
<p>I once translated the Russian great comedian Gogol's "The Story of How the Two Ivans Quarrelled." The content of that story is the most annoying and trivial, but at the end, the author reaches the highest expression of poetry, transforming all the annoying and trivial things into moving ones. In China, there has also been "The True Story of Ah Q," which has a humorous exterior and a painful core. These works do not give you a bit of anesthetizing sweetness after reading, but are more concrete than anything else in representing a certain kind of reality. Recently, I saw "The Triumph of Medicine" by the French writer Jules Romains, and I got the same impression.</p>
<p>According to the translator's introduction, Jules Romains is a playwright who has been working tirelessly in France for the past ten years, and his representative work "The Triumph of Medicine" has achieved rare success on the stage. "When it was first staged, it was performed continuously five hundred times, and the audience did not decrease significantly." Such a result may be excessive, but it has its reasons for success.</p>
<p>Like all comedies, "The Triumph of Medicine" has no content, or in other words, its content cannot be repeated. The translator of this book tells us that: this is "depicting a doctor who does not understand medicine, but understands the psychology of the masses, and how he uses the signboard of science to intimidate the masses and achieve success." This doctor is named Knock. He bought the right to be a doctor in a small town from another doctor. He hired a drummer to promote him. He also persuaded the local elementary school principal to do medical promotion for him. Moreover, he specially created free medical consultations. Everyone who came into his hospital, even those who were not sick, became sick; it would be a bit wrong to say that he was completely intimidating people, because he believed that there were no healthy people in the world, and everyone's body contained microbes, and he certainly believed so. It is absolutely true that he understands the psychology of the masses. Not only does he understand, but he also knows how to be considerate. He knows very well how much wealth a person must have to bear what kind of patient. He determines the severity of your illness according to your ability to pay. His meaning is this, there is no one in the world who is not sick, and it is indeed necessary to diagnose and treat the sick, but if you do not have the ability to pay for medical expenses, then the illness is not very important. But if you are very wealthy, then even if your illness is very mild, he must "intimidate you" to make you fall into bed. According to his investigation, the small town where he practiced medicine has "eight hundred and fifty-three households in the whole town, and among them there are one thousand five hundred and two households whose true annual income is more than twelve thousand francs." Moreover, he "has four levels of treatment. The lowest level is set for those whose annual income is between twelve thousand and twenty thousand francs, allowing only one outpatient visit per week and spending about fifty francs per month on medicine. The highest level, namely luxury treatment, is set for those whose annual income is more than fifty thousand francs, at least teaching them to have four outpatient visits per week and spending three hundred francs per month on miscellaneous expenses, including X-rays, radiation, electrical massage, analysis, general therapy, etc..."

<h3>The Diary of Marie Machinaff (II)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ye Zi</p>
<p>This morning 丨丨 From this morning on, my heart has been beating non-stop. A man passed by my window. I saw him coming down from the pasture and walking to the river. Heavens, how handsome he is! He is definitely not as massive as Alexi, no! He is small and strong, as strong as that poor cabbage yesterday.</p>
<p>He was wearing a velvet veston, carrying a folding stool and easel, a cigarette holder, and a smile that lit up his face, just like moonlight shining on a milky white bowl.</p>
<p>Am I in love with him? ...I don't know... When he passed by my window, I threw a rose ball at him... but he didn't notice. So I threw soap and a toothbrush at him again... but I missed again, he just went his way.</p>
<p>X X X X X X X X</p>
<p>Another day 丨丨 Love has broken into my life... I saw him again! I even spoke to him! He was sitting on his little stool. He was painting. I asked his name. His name! ...Thinking of writing this name, my heart jumped again. No... I won't write it out, I'll just say it softly: it's Odo Dinkesbeer.</p>
<p>What a beautiful name!</p>
<p>I also asked him:</p>
<p>"What are you painting at this moment? Is it the baby Jesus?"</p>
<p>"No," he said to me, "I'm painting a cow."</p>
<p>I looked closely. It was indeed a cow. So I shot my gaze into his pupils and said:</p>
<p>"This is our secret. We must not reveal it to anyone."</p>
<p>X X X X X X X X</p>
<p>A week later 丨丨 Every morning, I always go to the pasture to see Odo. I sit beside him and tell him in detail what I think, what I read, what I know, what I feel, and everything I don't feel. He listens with an attitude that seems not to be listening, which makes me fascinated. The closeness of our souls is wonderful.</p>
<p>X X X X X X X X</p>
<p>Today 丨丨 Odo touched me... This memory still makes my heart palpitate. By the river, when I was standing next to him, the edge of my parasol touched the last button on his vest... I suddenly felt a burning fire... Tomorrow, I will take Odo to see my dad.</p>

<h3>Finance - Gold Price Rises Further by $3.90 Within a Difference of $2.60</h3>
<p>丨Overseas Silver Market Continues to Fall丨</p>
<p>The gold market continued to rise yesterday, and the situation is still firm, but the daily fluctuations are extremely small, so the market is sluggish. In the early morning, the overseas silver market in both England and America has shrunk back. The forward silver price on the Gold Exchange has shrunk by 2.3 to 3.5%, and the exchange rate has not fallen much. The price of raw gold in London has risen by half a penny, and American cotton and wheat have both seen downstream. The opening of the morning's gross market rose to over $40, and the situation was quite stable. After the opening, the market tended to be tired, but because the banks' appetite tended to be bullish, there was still a rebound. The situation in the market after the rise turned to be trance-like, but the difference was limited, so the market was extremely flat. At noon, because large households were still buying and the central government also had open cash, although it fell, it could still be supported. The market head was even smaller in the afternoon, and the market was like death. Thanks to the vigorous buying by the Guangdong syndicate, the market was stable, struggling at the price of $2. The March period was more stable, and transactions were scarce. Lacking special stimulation throughout the day, it showed a mediocre appearance. The price of red gold was $952.5. The market conditions for today are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening (April period) was $941.8, an increase of $4.10 compared to the closing on Saturday of last week. Goods opened at $1.80.

Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Yicheng, Wanxing, Yuanmao, Yonghengxing, etc. successively entered strips, anticipating that HSBC Bank's listing of British and American would not move, and then rose to $2.30. Fuyu Zhengchang sold at 08%. Mitsui bought June US dollars 625 and 5625. Fuchang bought strips and rebounded. Macaulay ate June half-yuan.

<p>The opening of the afternoon market was $941.6, and goods were sold at $1.5. Wanxing Hengyu sold strips. Zhengjin issued April US dollars 1875. The market was slightly tired, but because Fuyu Hengchang Yongsheng Dada accepted strips, Zhengjin accepted June US dollars half-yuan, and rose to $2.40. Yuanchun Hengchang Yong took advantage of the high price to sell and reduced to $1.60. Shengda Qianchangxiang still entered, and the situation was generally flat, and transactions were also flat. Finally, Yuan Mao Yong and Futai Heng came to sell, and from $2.40, it retreated to $1.60. The closing price was $941.6, and goods were sold at $1.7.

<p>The announced price was that HSBC Bank's listing of the US exchange rate was unchanged, still at $34.375, and the combined standard gold price was $1006.00. In terms of the closing price, it was about $65 less than the standard, which was about $4 less than on Saturday of last week. The announced price for the March period was that the shilling was unchanged, so it was still calculated at $711. In terms of the closing price, it was about $8 less than the standard.

The total number of transactions was 18,277 strips in the morning market, and 7,084 strips in the afternoon market, for a total of 34 long positions and 57 short positions.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the March period was $703, an increase of $4.60 compared to the closing on Saturday of last week. This price was sold by Hengchang Yong to Shunli for 7 strips. After entering, Hongxing sold to Shunli, etc. for $2.50. Shunli repeatedly sold, and it was reduced to $1.70. Wanxing Yicheng took advantage of the low price to纳条, gradually rising to $3. The bank supplied the shilling, and the English exchange market loosened. Hengyu came to sell strips, and the buyers were quieter, gradually downstream. By noon, it had retreated to $701.6. In the afternoon, Huixiang entered $2, and the opening was $702. Goods and Fuyu, etc. 纳条 and rose to $2.8. Finally, Cuitai sold to Yida Yongzhifeng Yong 7 strips each, $2.6.

<h3>Grand Occasion of Public Bond Delivery in February Securities Market</h3>
<p>丨Total Transaction Volume of 61.04 Million Yuan丨</p>
<p>丨Exchange Delivery of 19.14 Million Yuan丨</p>
<p>丨Self-Delivery of 41.9 Million Yuan丨</p>
<p>New High Prices Emerge One After Another</p>
<p>All Items Break Old Records</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 26th, was the delivery date for the February futures of public bonds at the Chinese Securities Exchange. The settlement volume on this day was extremely large, an unprecedented grand occasion in recent times. The total amount reached a huge 61.04 million yuan. Among this, excluding the clearing of accounts by various brokers, the amount for self-delivery was 41.9 million yuan. The amount for actual delivery at the exchange was 19.14 million yuan. The account settlement by various brokers outside the exchange was not included. Although the number cannot be verified, it must also be very large. The settlement volume is truly remarkable. The five-number bond was the most received. Other groups also had scattered absorption. The financial sector accounted for the most delivered. The market price trend is also worth mentioning. The February futures debuted on December 30th of the previous year and ended on February 22nd. Although it lasted for more than fifty days, due to the Lunar New Year and the abolition of the old lunar year with more than ten days of holidays, there were actually only more than forty market days. When the February futures debuted, it coincided with the autumn of the Min Incident. Therefore, it was immediately affected after the opening. Later, the central army successively won victories, conquering Taishun. The 19th Route Army abandoned Yanping, Gutian was captured, and Fuzhou was occupied in a few days. With the Min Incident resolved, people's confidence became even stronger. The buying sentiment was extremely strong, and the bond market continued to rise. New high prices emerged one after another. After the red opening of the abolished Lunar New Year, the upward trend intensified. Later, due to the recent loose monetary conditions and white borrowing of silver exchange every day, investors increased, and the bond market rose even more vigorously. When the futures trading was suspended on the 22nd, the Deficit Reduction Bond still rushed to the 70 yuan mark, creating a new high price of 70 yuan and 1.5 cents, breaking the record of 69 yuan and 2 cents on July 19th of the 22nd year. The Salt Tax Bond also rose to 53 yuan and 3 cents. Other items also broke the old year's records. After the February suspension of trading, due to the high prices, some floating long positions emerged, and sellers began to divest. In addition, rumors spread in the market, and the lively market was slightly sluggish. However, many people still held optimistic views, and the bond market may not decline as a result. The total transaction volume in February and the delivery and clearing numbers are listed below separately (unit: hundred yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Unanimously Declines</h3>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm on the 24th stated: Initially, the New York stock market was strong due to short covering in aviation stocks. Later, due to the possibility of strikes in the automotive industry, many automotive stocks were sold off, and the market situation declined again. The railway freight report was good, but railway stocks weakened again. Bonds declined, especially those with speculative characteristics. U.S. Treasury bonds were relatively flat, and the market trend is temporarily difficult to rise. Half-day trading volume was 1.22 million shares. (Wheat) trading was light, initially rising due to rumors of tariffs on rye, and then falling due to profit-taking by long positions. In general, it is advisable to buy on sharp declines. (Cotton) The delay in discussing the Punk Hai case and rumors that the case was legally non-compliant caused unease, and selling increased during the rise. At present, the long side should be cautious. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price       Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks  104.77           Down 1.37</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks    49.08            Down 0.94</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Manufacturers' Hedging Rumors Arise Again, Retail Speculators Still Tend to Sell</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and a downtrend is slightly emerging. Because the actual demand is still sluggish, and there are rumors in the market that Jin Cheng Yarn is hedging again, people are particularly apprehensive. Retail speculators still tend to sell. However, a certain manufacturer is optimistic and absorbs at low prices. However, the bottom is already dry, and the future still depends on consumption.</p>
<h3>Human Label Decline Intensifies</h3>
<p>The human label market opened with few buyers, and the market sentiment was scattered. Prices for each month fell by 1.3-1.4 yuan. The market situation improved slightly in the afternoon, but weakened again after trading two or three rounds, falling by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 19,200 bales. Da Feng sold 1,700 bales, Chun Ji 700 bales, Yu Kang 700 bales, Geng Feng 1,100 bales, Chang Feng 900 bales, and Sen Kang 650 bales. Tai Chang bought 600 bales, Yuan Da 750 bales, Ren Feng 1,200 bales, Heng Chang 950 bales, Da Chang 650 bales, and Yuan Tai 600 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yunnan 9 Mainland 140 Xiamen 25 Guangdong 95 Ningbo 6</p>
<p>North 5 Haizhou 10 Shantou 70 Jiangxi 1 Fujian 10</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Sentiment Softens</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still weak. Because U.S. cotton has slightly declined, and Indian cotton has also softened, and the yarn market has also fallen back, the market sentiment has weakened. There is a lack of buyers, and the demand for spot cotton is stagnant. However, some people are observing that U.S. cotton may not have major flaws.</p>
<h3>Zheng Label Falls Three and a Half Cents</h3>
<p>The Zheng Label market opened with stable U.S. cotton, but few buyers. Prices for each month fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The situation remained weak in the afternoon, with prices falling by another 0.05-0.1 yuan for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 67,900 dan.

<h3>Grain: Flour Factories Eager to Sell</h3>
<p>丨Government Bids U.S. Wheat at Four Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, all months showed a consistent decline. U.S. wheat quotations were slightly better by 4 cents in Chicago and 2 cents in Canada, with little fluctuation. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere was still stable. However, various factories sold off, and sales gradually became very active. Several large factories, with a large number of hedged goods on hand, sold in large quantities. In addition, the selling price of spot U.S. wheat also gradually declined. The government seemed eager to sell, with a price of only 4 yuan. However, factories were still unwilling to buy. Therefore, each month continued to decline. Until the afternoon opening, the bulls inside and outside the industry felt that it was useless to resist in such an environment, so they also closed out one after another. Furthermore, with the selling by factories, the selling sentiment in the market became even more active, and prices became even weaker. According to speculation by people in the industry, if the government wheat is sold cheaply without end, the two-yuan mark may be within sight. As a result, the current month fell by 3.75 cents compared to the previous week, March fell by 2.5 cents, April and May fell by 3 cents, June fell by 2.5 cents, and July fell by 2.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Sales Not Yet Rushing Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market situation for each month was generally flat and weak. U.S. wheat quotations were better by 4 cents in Chicago and about 2 cents in Canada. The market sentiment remained flat and weak. Soon, with the flour market weakening and the government wheat gradually becoming loose, it seemed that there was no possibility of optimism for future prices. However, market sales were not very active. Therefore, although the situation for each month was not good, the extent of the decline was small. As a result, April fell by 5 cents compared to the previous week, June fell by 5 cents, and July fell by 3 cents. There were no comparisons for the rest. The spot wheat market price was stable. It was reported that kiln bay wheat was 3.43 yuan, Suzhou wheat was 3.42 yuan, Huangqiao wheat was 3.41 yuan, Guzhen wheat was 3.36 yuan, Bengbu wheat was 3.34 yuan, and Kunshan wheat was 3.30 yuan. Fuxin took more than 300 bags, Fufeng took 2,400 bags, and Huafeng took 300 bags.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Groups Handling Du Rice</h3>
<p>Late Rice Arrives in Volume, Falling Several Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from various groups surged, totaling more than sixty (more than 8,000 stones). Zhongyi and Xi Nong were the most common, while Geng and various colors accounted for half. Since customers from Tianjin and other places seemed interested in buying late rice, now customers from various groups are successively entering the market. Southern Ocean group, Xiamen customers, took the lead in handling, and Tianjin and other groups followed suit, making the situation relatively lively. However, since customers' buying prices were low, sellers had no choice but to sell with pain. As a result, the Northern and Southern Ocean groups purchased more than 2,000 bags. The goods were all green corner, Song Si, Xi Lian, and other goods. The market price fell slightly by a few cents. The local shop business was still sluggish, and sales were still depressed. The market situation was soft and depreciating. Geng rice from Changbang, Su Tongbang, and Nangang continued to be cut by several cents. Du Yangjian rice, due to the shortage of goods, stood firm. The Yin Yuan suddenly became tight, and the Bian Yuan had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than fifty sources from various groups in Hexia. The sales of various goods in the market improved. The price of Bai Geng, Du Jian, Bu Jian, and early rice was flat and weak. Yang Xian was high and strong. Medium and lower grades were cut by several cents. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan Keqian were stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Longjiang Green Goods Scarce, Looking to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's pricing showed that although No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was still quoted at 19.7 yuan, inquiries were still few. Re-export goods were 6.65 yuan, with hundreds of bags transacted. Because the customs gold rose, it increased by 5 cents compared to the previous day. Taikoo sugar and local factory cotton white sugar prices were the same as before. Only dozens of bags of Chaoqing high Huanggang were offered, priced at 11.5-11.6 yuan. The lower-grade Longjiangqing Shandi has been sold out. It is heard that the Suiyang Hesheng two rounds will transport more than a thousand bags today. Because the prices in the production area are firm, the Shanghai market is looking to rise (The previously reported Weijiangqing price of 13.5 yuan was actually 10.05 yuan, please correct).</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Sun-Dried Longan, Long Out of Stock, Arrives Initially</h3>
<p>Xiamen sun-dried longan Shandi has been sold out long ago. Furthermore, due to the long-term lack of sources, various groups want to add inventory during the red market trading. Therefore, the market situation is exquisite. Yesterday, it was heard that the Taikoo Company's Lin'an ship transported a batch, only four pieces. Samples can be seen approximately today. Based on the market trend, there may be an increase.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shrimp Rice Inventory Reaches Two Prosperities</h3>
<p>丨Still Needs to Watch for Declines丨</p>
<p>Shrimp rice Jinshanwei, because the sales of various routes are not moving, and the arrival inventory is prosperous, the market price of large-sized goods is 105 yuan, medium-sized goods are around 100 yuan, and small-sized goods are 93-94 yuan, which has fallen by 2-3 yuan compared to the red market. However, there is still a lack of buyers. According to people in the industry, it still needs to be watched for declines in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yuanzhi Tribute Substandard Goods Sell Well</h3>
<p>丨Slight Changes in the Woolen Industry</p>
<p>Not many new Yuanqing tribute woolen goods have arrived in port. The sales of lower-grade goods are the most fluent. Yesterday, Ning Feng Hang's ten boxes of single-sided tribute were purchased by Hua Fu Tai at a transaction price of 4 yuan net. The goods arrived and were offered for sale at 4.3 yuan. These single-sided tribute and 5.0 yuan substandard double-sided tribute are out of stock, with a considerable risk of being out of stock. Because the exchange rate is slightly better, foreign firms' pricing is 2-3 cents more expensive, so no one orders.</p>
<p>There is news of changes in the woolen industry. It is heard that Yifeng and Huakang's share increases remain the same. Jiuhe and Jiuda are merging into Jiufeng. Jiufeng, Yukang, Xinchang, and Meilun are planning to move to the west side of the fabric exchange next door. Huachengxiang's share increase will change the brand name to Hongxiang. Huasheng and Tonghexiang are changing their font size. Xiangxing's liquidation has been confirmed (Another number is also heard to be liquidated). Fuxin will temporarily move opposite Huaxin and wait for the new house on the original site to be completed before moving in again.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Spring Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>White Tung oil trading in Hankou foreign firms is very rare. When the spring market first opened, each foreign firm handled only dozens of tons to a hundred tons, with prices increased to 24.6 yuan per dan according to foreign regulations. Then, Hankou Hang wanted to increase to 25 yuan. The foreign firms' intentions weakened as a result. They held on for three or four days, and still sold about a hundred tons at 24.5-24.6 yuan. Hankou Hang opened the guest goods for 19.23 yuan for the Southern Branch and 19.45 yuan for Changde goods, approximately 2,000-3,000 dan. The closing price in the Hankou market was not much different from the opening price. Although there was a tight period, there were no transactions, only one kind of situation. As for Zhejiang Tung, it was quite powerful because the opening was decorated with Hankou market rumors. But it was just a fleeting moment and the romance dispersed. Therefore, the initial price was 21.7-21.8 yuan for delivery to Shanghai, but it soon fell to 21.2 yuan and 21.07-21.08 yuan, and there was a tendency to fall further. Hangzhou Hang has been sending people to Shanghai to sell for days, but there are not many transactions. Last night, the local firms received a call from Lanxi that it had fallen to 19.6 yuan, with Hangzhou Jianggan delivery, then it would only be 20.02-20.03 yuan to Shanghai. Because each firm has slight winter deposits, there have not been many purchases since the spring market. Only a certain bean and rice firm also deals in foreign Tung oil. It went to Zhejiang last week to complete more than 3,000 dan at a price between 20.07-20.08 yuan. The goods have not yet arrived, and the market has already fallen. Based on the current market, the loss is not insignificant.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tallow Market Will Look Small</h3>
<p>The Chinese tallow market in this port, since the opening of the spring market, the sales field seems to be clearer than in previous years. Since the spring market is usually slightly higher than the formal market price, only a few people handle it. After the closing, the market situation will inevitably stagnate, and there must be a basis after the markets from everywhere converge. Shanghai originally relied on the Hankou market, and the Hankou market opening is not certain sooner or later. However, it has advanced slightly in recent years, probably determined by the amount of borrowing and loading before the opening. According to this year's borrowing and loading statistics, the unified Hankou market has only a thousand pieces, and the sales clarity is unprecedented. Therefore, the Tianjin market oil futures were opened the day before yesterday, and the price was around 16 yuan. Although the Jing oil has not opened, the general situation is not as powerful as the closing time. It can be generally seen. The firms in this port do not borrow too much from Hankou, and the winter stock is not very thick. In addition, they received the news that the Hankou market opened weak. Therefore, although the sales disk does not show a price drop, the market air has been sluggish, and the secret selling price has not been unified, which seems to be in a shaky state.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Gray Silk Has Discovered New Sales Channels</h3>
<p>Gray silk from Shandong and other provinces (that is, wild silkworm silk) is a unique natural product in our country and is widely sold in European and American countries. Recently, it has been affected by the dumping of gray silk from Japan and South Korea (Japan and Korea have seen increasing wild silkworm silk production in recent years) and artificial silk, which has caused our country's gray silk exports to plummet. Export has become the end of the crossbow. Recently, India has suddenly discovered a new sales channel. English ships transport dozens of packages to India every month. Therefore, English and Indian firms often purchase gray silk, and the market price has risen by more than 20 yuan compared to the past.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thin Tinplate Market Inventory Is Thin</h3>
<p>The spot thin tinplate market was very thin yesterday. Customer groups such as Hankou and Tianjin are vying to seek it, and the tobacco factories, can factories, printing factories, and biscuit factories on this street are also trying their best to find it. Therefore, there are fewer and fewer bottom goods, and the market is becoming more exquisite. What's more, the arrival of goods is far away, so the market atmosphere is becoming more and more upright. The standards have repeatedly increased, calculated at 60 yuan per box, which is 4-5 yuan higher than before. It is heard that more than 70-80 boxes were opened in the market yesterday.</p>

<h3>Overseas Naval Academy Students First Study Shipbuilding at School</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 26th) The Navy previously agreed with Italy on the method for naval academy students to study abroad. Chen Shaokuan specially hired Ye Yunchiao, who had just returned from the United States and is currently a staff member of the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Institute, to teach shipbuilding at the academy, so that the students can prepare and study in the country first, and then go to Italy to study abroad for further education.</p>
<h3>Status of Secondary and Higher Education in Various Counties of Jiangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The number of secondary and higher education schools in various counties of Jiangxi Province in the 20th year was 68, with 491 classes, 15,063 students, 1,871 faculty and staff, and an expenditure of 18,710,400 yuan. The number of students per class was 30, and the annual cost per student was 124.124 yuan. In the 21st year, there were 69 schools, 471 classes, 13,663 students, 1,731 faculty and staff, and an expenditure of 17,033,390 yuan. The number of students per class was 29, and the annual cost per student was 124.670 yuan. From the above table, in the 21st year, the number of schools increased by 1, the number of classes decreased by 20, the number of students decreased by 1,400, the number of faculty and staff decreased by 140, and the expenditure decreased by 1,677,010.01 yuan. On the surface, it seems that there is no progress in secondary and higher education, and even a decline. However, the decrease in the number of classes is not a decline, but a reorganization of secondary education, reducing the number of ordinary middle schools and increasing or reorganizing vocational and normal schools. The decrease in the number of students is actually affected by the sharp reduction in the number of joint county, municipal, private, and specialized schools. The number of provincial students has even slightly increased. Because the number of schools has decreased, the annual cost per student has increased compared to the past. In short, the increase in the annual cost per student and the decrease in the number of students in this province cannot but make people suspect that it is difficult to meet the conditions of economy and education. This is a unique phenomenon in Jiangxi Province, so it is necessary to make secondary education, A. In the future, attention should be paid to the administrative aspects: (1) Enrich the content and increase equipment as much as possible; (2) If it is not possible to recruit enough students, only combine classes, etc.</p>

<h3>Board Meeting of the Science Society of China</h3>

<p>The Science Society of China held its 116th board meeting the other day. Attendees included Wang Jiliang, Hu Gangfu, Zhao Yuanren, Ren Shuyong, Zhou Zijing, and Yang Yunzhong (represented by Lu Xiune). Ren Shuyong chaired the meeting, and Lu Jine recorded the minutes. The agenda was as follows: (1) There were a total of four papers for the Miss Gao Memorial Award for the 21st year: (1) Wang Dazhu's "Research on Earthquakes," (2) Wang Yijin's "Historical View of Soil," (3) Ding's "Principles of Earthquake Comparison," and (4) Chen Guoda's "Problems of the Pearl River Delta in Guangzhou." The review committee, consisting of Zhu Oufang, Zhang Xiaofeng, and Li Zhongkui, completed the review. According to the opinions of the committee members, Chen Guoda's paper seemed to be the most suitable. Whether it is appropriate or not, please vote. The motion was passed according to the opinion of the review committee, and Chen Guoda's "Problems of the Pearl River Delta in Guangzhou" was selected as the Miss Gao Memorial Award paper for the 21st year. Could the remaining three papers be selected for publication in the Science Journal? Please have Zhu Oufang review them. (2) The funds raised by the Institute of Biology are still far from the quota.

(4) The Society was born on June 10, 1914, and formally established on October 25 of the following year. June 10 of this year is the 20th anniversary of its birth.

(5) Society member Ma Minghai, representing Guangxi, invited the Society to hold its annual meeting in Guangxi this summer.

<h3>The Chinese Western Academy of Sciences Sends Personnel to Inspect Agricultural Affairs in Various Places</h3>
<p>Inspector Liu Shimin Arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>There Is Great Hope for the Revival of Agriculture in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>The Chinese Western Academy of Sciences in Beipei, Chongqing, Sichuan, is a large-scale scientific research institution in our country. Although it has only been established for two years, its achievements are remarkable. Everyone who goes to Sichuan and Xikang praises the academy. The academy recently sent Liu Shimin, the director of the botanical garden and a researcher at the botanical department, to inspect agricultural affairs in various places and visit scientific research institutions. Liu visited Yantai, Laiyang, Peiping, Tianjin, Baoding, Dingxian, Ningbo, Hangzhou, and other places, and arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday, staying at the Mengyuan Hostel. He is scheduled to visit the Commodity Inspection Bureau, Serum Manufacturing Institute, and other institutions within the next few days, and will return to Sichuan in a few days. Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter visited Liu at the hostel to discuss the establishment process and recent work as follows:</p>
<h3>Establishment Process</h3>
<p>The academy has been established for two years so far. The president is Mr. Lu Zuoji. The sources of funding include fixed subsidies from the 21st Army and the China Cultural Foundation Committee, and non-fixed subsidies from the Sichuan Education Expenditure Office, Minsheng Shipping Company, and Sichuan-Kang Colonial Bank, as well as funds from other research institutions for entrusted projects. The total annual amount is approximately 60,000 to 100,000 yuan. The salaries of the staff are not high, but they are quite willing to sacrifice, and their spirit of service is commendable.</p>
<h3>Internal Organization</h3>
<p>The academy's internal structure is divided into four parts: the Institute of Physics and Chemistry, the Institute of Geology, the Institute of Biology, and the Institute of Agriculture and Forestry. The Institute of Physics and Chemistry is cooperating with the Institute of Physics and Chemistry of the Academia Sinica. The Institute of Geology is cooperating with the Geological Survey of Peiping of the Academia Sinica. The Institute of Biology is cooperating with the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute and the Science Society of China. The Institute of Agriculture and Forestry is currently negotiating cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the China Economic Commission.</p>
<h3>Recent Work</h3>
<p>The academy's Department of Physics and Chemistry is currently analyzing mineral products from various places near Beipei, the Department of Geology is investigating the geology of the Jialing River, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry is implementing rice breeding, pest control, and special fruit tree propagation experiments, and is carrying out afforestation in various wastelands in Beipei. More than 8,000 kinds of special fruit seedlings were collected by Liu this time. The Department of Biology is carrying out preliminary research work, collecting and classifying all Sichuan flora and fauna, and establishing a botanical garden, gathering Sichuan plants in one garden, so that people from other places who come to Sichuan for visits do not have to travel to various places. The garden is currently being measured and construction is underway.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Experiments</h3>
<p>Chen Rangqing, the director of the Sichuan Central Agricultural Experiment Station, also came to Shanghai. According to him, the station is the only large-scale experiment station in Sichuan Province, funded and organized by the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Office (i.e., Liu Xiang of the 21st Army), established for one and a half years, and is a provincial agricultural station. It is divided into four departments: agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry, and agricultural chemistry. The agronomy department focuses on cotton planting experiments, and its cotton planting results have exceeded those of the southeastern provinces. The horticulture department focuses on the improvement, storage, and transportation of citrus fruits, as the surrounding counties are citrus-producing areas. The animal husbandry department focuses on pigs and sheep, and the agricultural chemistry department specializes in agricultural product manufacturing. According to Liu, Sichuan Province has abundant resources and is of great importance to national defense. The products of both southern and northern China are suitable for cultivation in Sichuan. The degree of agricultural improvement has already shown signs of revival. If efforts continue, the future of Sichuan Province is promising.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Sends Personnel to Conduct Maze Intelligence Tests in Suzhou and Wuxi</h3>
<p>Intelligence testing of children is of great importance to the improvement of primary school administration. The resolution of all issues related to admission grading and teaching research must rely on the assistance of intelligence testing in order to have objective results. However, the results of intelligence tests compiled in our country in the past have not been significant. The Pinay-Simon test materials compiled and printed by the Chinese Education Improvement Society seven years ago were not fully suitable for kindergarten and lower grades of primary schools, perhaps due to the slightly higher cost and complicated procedures. In view of this, the Municipal Education Bureau has adopted the Porteus Maze Test scale to create a simple and effective intelligence test scale to supplement the deficiencies of the Pinay-Simon test scale. Last year, the bureau tested approximately 4,000 children in this city and the cities of Nanjing and Hangzhou. Currently, the number of children of each age tested is uneven, which hinders statistics. It is planned to conduct tests in other cities to increase the number to 6,000. It is reported that the bureau has decided to send personnel to primary schools in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places in early next month to conduct the intelligence tests, so that children from different social environments in various places can be tested together, and the results may be more accurate and universally applicable.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Convenes a Standing Committee Meeting of the Children's Welfare Association Today</h3>
<p>To Be Held at the Municipal Government Reception Room on Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee submitted a request to the Municipal Government to designate this year as Children's Year, it has spared no effort in carrying out various tasks. Recently, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the chairman of the association, noted that the association's operating funds were still outstanding, which prevented the realization of the various plans in the ideal. Therefore, he has specifically scheduled a sixth standing committee meeting to be held at 5:00 PM today at the Municipal Government Reception Room on Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson, to discuss raising funds for the association and other important business. The standing committee members Pan Gongzhan, Li Tingan, Chen Heqin, Hu Shuyi, Wang Guanyi, Liu Wang Liming, and Zhao Zengqi will attend. Mr. Wen Hongen, the director of the Children's Protection Department of the association, and Ms. Yang Maorong, the director of the nursery, have also been invited to attend. It is heard that due to the urgency of time, no further notice will be issued.</p>
<h3>City Education Bureau Orders Students with Dental Problems to Go to the Children's Dental Hospital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all primary and secondary schools in the city, stating: "Based on a report from the Family Industries Society, 'In order to promote dental health and oral hygiene, and for the sake of the healthy well-being of children, our society has established the Children's Dental Hospital at No. 191-193, 2nd Floor, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, in a central location. The scope of diagnosis and treatment is limited to boys and girls under the age of sixteen. Those over sixteen will not be accepted under any circumstances. However, students in primary and secondary schools in this city, even if they are over the age of sixteen, who have a dental treatment form issued by the Municipal Education Bureau, are exempt from this restriction. Please instruct all schools that any student with unhealthy teeth should be referred to the hospital for examination to avoid hindering the child's development. Our society will charge diagnosis fees according to regulations to fulfill its social service responsibilities.' Based on this, it is recognized that children's teeth are of great importance to their health. If students in your school have dental defects, they should seek treatment immediately. In addition to the children's dental clinics established by the Health Bureau and this bureau, schools can also go to the Children's Dental Hospital for treatment. However, students over the age of sixteen must first obtain an introduction form from this bureau before going for examination. You are hereby ordered to take note of this order."</p>

<h3>First Act of the Sino-British Billiards Competition: Li Gongying Wins a Great Victory</h3>
<p>Defeats Botter by 424 Points Yesterday</p>
<p>Unlimited Hope for the Future of the Chinese Team</p>
<p>The second Sino-British International Billiards Competition began yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM at the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Club. The Chinese team's star player, Li Gongying, started off by defeating the British player Botter by a large margin, winning by 424 points out of a total of 750 points, giving unlimited hope for the future of the Chinese team. Tomorrow afternoon at 5:30 PM, Shen Lince will face Nie Kerer, promising a fierce battle.</p>
<h3>A General View of the Art</h3>
<p>Li's victory over Botter was never in question. What was noteworthy was how Li was able to display his own aspirations. Fifty shots for 750 points, averaging 15 points per shot, can be considered an excellent score in Li's previous records of competition with major strong opponents. Yesterday's largest scores were 93, 74, 68, 65, 58, 53, 52, etc. It is regrettable that the last few shots showed some weakness; otherwise, the average score could have been close to 20. The British Botter, a white-haired veteran, was relaxed in his attitude. He was still able to cope with a cue in his hand. He used the "open teng" several times, with much of the Smith style. Limited by his qualifications, he was defeated after exhausting his strength. His large scores were 42, 39, 37, 29, 20, etc., averaging slightly more than 6.5 points per shot, which seemed to be slightly less than usual.</p>
<h3>Competition Situation</h3>
<p>Li scored 16 points on the first shot, and Botter also scored 16 points on the second shot. After three missed shots, Li scored two huge scores of 58 and 33 in a row, taking the lead. Botter scored 39 points on the seventh shot, followed by 20 points, bringing the score closer. Li scored an unexpectedly lucky ball, scoring 52 points in a row, once imitating Smith's tactics and scoring 65 points. Once, when the opponent's ball had already entered the pocket, he also scored 74 points by hitting a red ball alone. The largest score of 93 points was obtained due to various methods, which was extremely interesting. Before the 50th shot was finished, he had already scored 44 points, ending the game. Botter was 77 points behind on the 10th shot, 120 points behind between the 10th and 20th shots, and only 54 points behind between the 20th and 30th shots. In the last 20 shots, however, the difference was quite large. As a result, he lost by a total of 424 points.</p>

<h3>Municipal Sports Field Organizes Amateur Basketball Association</h3>
<p>Will Continue to Organize a Table Tennis Association in the Future</p>
<p>The Municipal Sports Field organizes an amateur basketball competition every spring, holding outdoor basketball games with remarkable results. This spring, it will continue to organize the fourth amateur basketball competition, starting registration on March 3 and closing on March 25. The players of the participating teams must be purely amateur members of the industrial and commercial sectors. School students and those who take sports as a profession are not allowed to participate. At the time of registration, a registration form printed by the association must be filled in detail and a photo of all team members must be attached. The competition dates are on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays, which does not interfere with the professions of various sectors. The association has printed a detailed set of regulations for those who wish to participate, which can be requested and read. In addition, the field has recently set up seven table tennis rooms in the south building, in order to popularize practice. After the basketball competition is over, it is planned to hold a table tennis competition immediately to promote indoor sports.</p>

<p>Random Remarks</p>
<h3>Liquidation! Bankruptcy!</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The problem is unfolding before us in this way; it seems to be getting more serious! However, those who are intoxicated in the embrace of the metropolis are still enjoying themselves in comfort and pleasure, desperately indulging in the aroma of wine and meat, and anesthetizing themselves. How can they care about these things?</p>
<p>The wave of global economic recession surged for a while. But after the efforts and struggles of the people of various countries, it has finally improved a lot. However, it still tightly shrouds China, even more severely than in the past. Although everyone in China knows that it is subject to external economic aggression and internal war disasters, as well as other heavy oppression. The rural economy is collapsing, and the commercial market is bankrupt. The people are impoverished, and the country is exhausted to the extreme! However, these neighboring powers, eyeing China like tigers, still regard China as a forbidden delicacy; everyone wants to get involved. Recently, the United States is advocating raising the price of silver, intending to dump their surplus products into our country's market. They don't even see that our country's commerce is already struggling with exhausted voices, and the result is still bankruptcy and liquidation!</p>
<p>The banners of year-round big sales and big giveaways are fluttering in front of every store or company, which already symbolizes the general ironclad proof of the decline of our country's market. Although they keep shouting "regardless of cost, unprecedented sacrifice," cheap goods still have to be exchanged for money after all!</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, the court authorities received more than 500 business firms that had been applied for sealing by creditors. The court authorities, in consideration of maintaining the appearance of the great Shanghai market, transferred the matter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find ways to mediate. Unexpectedly, due to the lack of mediation, more than 200 firms have already declared bankruptcy and liquidation on their own. This includes more than 20 silk and satin businesses, more than 10 southern goods businesses, more than 10 money shops, and more than 100 other large and small businesses. And there are still business firms that are about to close but have not yet closed, and those that are about to go bankrupt but have not yet gone bankrupt. I am afraid that in the near future, they will also close their doors one after another!</p>
<p>Looking at the newspapers from various provinces and counties in the interior, the phenomenon of economic recession is no different from that in Shanghai. Taking Huzhou alone, more than 400 business firms have closed down this year due to excessive losses. In Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places, the number of business firms that have declared liquidation and bankruptcy because they cannot maintain the status quo accounts for two-thirds. A few that are barely struggling temporarily are also in a precarious state. Judging from this situation, according to my observation, by the Dragon Boat Festival of this lunar year, perhaps a large number of business firms will have to prepare to post liquidation notices on their doors.</p>
<p>Our country's intelligent capitalists, seeing the terrifying phenomenon of the commercial future, are all refraining from moving forward, regarding commerce as if it were a dangerous path. Everyone dares not invest in commerce, but instead deposits money in banks or buys securities and public bonds to earn a little interest. Therefore, this makes general merchants feel even more the lack of funds and the inflexibility of financial turnover.</p>
<p>The fact that general stores in Shanghai cannot maintain the status quo is directly due to the oppression of rent, which is indeed a major reason. Therefore, I also advocate that if we want to revive the prosperity of the Shanghai market, we must reduce rent. Reducing rent is a matter of urgent importance at present. Its reasons are most obvious in two aspects: (1) Reducing rent can directly reduce the burden on citizens, and the expenses of stores will also be saved as a result. (2) Indirectly, it can give a blow to capitalists who are engaged in real estate investment, so that they can reduce their delusions of investing in real estate and not cause land prices to rise arbitrarily. Therefore, if we want to save the Shanghai commercial market, the prerequisite is to reduce rent. However, how easy is it to talk about? Those powerful and stubborn industrialists and big landlords are not easy to deal with after all. Moreover, the inside story of the rent reduction movement, it is said, is that the members are also very complicated.</p>
<p>In short, if things continue like this, then I can say that not only is the commercial future of our entire country not optimistic.</p>
<h3>An Explanation of Small Families</h3>
<p>— Construction</p>
<p>In large cities, the small family is already the organization of the times. But in the interior, it has yet to sprout. Even in the cities, there are still some old-fashioned thinkers who sigh and denounce it, saying that the small family organization is nothing more than a fashionable disease of Westernization, a selfish and self-serving little organization, an act of human degeneration, a base doctrine that deviates from economic principles... From this, we can see that it is still a problem, and that there are people who oppose its establishment.</p>
<p>We believe that an organization, or simply, let's call it a thing, whether it is a good thing or a bad thing; whether it should be opposed or not, we have one condition to determine it, which is to see whether it meets our actual needs. I think this is the best way to evaluate its merits. Here we can examine the essence of the small family. From history, we see the prosperity of tribal times and their decline, which shows that a social organization, or a social system, does not have a perpetual suitability, but will die when it reaches the stage of aging. We can see this in the decline of the Roman Empire; without this explanation, it is difficult to find the reason why such a powerful country would be destroyed. In the family organization, we can also find the same reason. The old large family system, inheriting the remnants of the clan society, flourished. The head of a large family was like a king of a country. He controlled the family's economic power and held the life and death of the entire family. He ruled and controlled everything they did. Under this control, the whole family worked together to produce (the distribution of products was up to the head of the family), and it shone with extraordinary brilliance. But when society develops to a certain stage, the organization changes, and at this time we can see that the brilliance of the large family gradually loses its luster. The position of agriculture has been replaced by industry, the fields are full of machines, and the workers in the fields have become surplus idlers, migrating in groups to industrial areas. Thus, economically, the large family is no longer needed, on the one hand because of the collapse of dispersion, and on the other hand because of the relationship of life. However, it is not the fundamental destruction of the family, but the need for a new organization. Thus, the small family inevitably appears in the development of history.</p>
<p>Because in large families, we know that there are several defects that cannot be concealed: first, there are too few producers and too many non-producers in large families; second, the economic power of large families is in the hands of the head of the family alone, and the family members, even if they devote themselves to production with all their might, cannot secure the comfort of their own and their wives' food and clothing; third, because of economic poverty, the feelings between brothers and sisters-in-law cannot but be opposed; fourth, because marriages are arranged, love cannot be obtained from wives, causing infinite depression in life.</p>
<p>Therefore, we know that this family organization with too many defects cannot continue to exist and must be replaced by small families. The so-called small family is only different from the large family. Its members are only a husband, a wife, and their minor children. Living in modern society, the skills of making a living must be possessed by each individual, because no one has the power to bear the lives of several people, and the organization of the family should be that every family member is responsible for the economy. This is the foundation of the small family. All men and women who want to form a family must have grown up, not only grown up, but also able to maintain their lives independently. Another point is that their union is due to love. From the union of love, we know that first, they can know each other deeply, and they can get deep comfort from each other in life; second, they can endure hardships together and strive for their own happiness. If they say they will both produce, they will both enjoy. There are no idle members who do not produce, and no idle people who do not love each other to divide their interests. When the children grow up, they become the preparatory members of the small family. At this time, in addition to education, they no longer ask for any material rights from their parents' family temple. They cannot but find a job, and after finding a job, they will form a small family.</p>
<p>From this point of view, we know, is this small family a selfish and self-serving little organization, a fashionable disease of Westernization, an act of human degeneration, and a base doctrine that deviates from economic principles? If they are not hot-headed people, they will of course know that this is the error of the opponents. The small family is a system that will inevitably occur in the course of social evolution, and this system is precisely in line with our actual needs, and can stimulate and promote us to step on the road to progress. As for whether this small family organization is in line with modern economic principles, it is even more beyond the comprehension of ordinary people. We know that the consolidation of an organization depends entirely on its economic foundation. It is of course far superior to have each member produce and maintain their lives independently, compared to many members of large families who do not produce and rely on others to live.</p>
<h3>A Friend from a Foreign Land</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>The Avenue Joffre at night is like a rainbow, with shops on both sides spewing out light like crazy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a hand patted my shoulder. When I turned around, I recognized the owner of the hand as Duzjikov—he was a White Russian, my neighbor, selling Evening Posts.</p>
<p>"Where are you going? Mr. Wang."</p>
<p>I smiled at him and shook my head, meaning that I was just wandering around aimlessly!</p>
<p>He looked at me with heavy pupils, a sad smile floating on his lips.</p>
<p>"Duzjikov, didn't you sell newspapers today?"</p>
<p>"Hahahaha," he laughed wildly:</p>
<p>"I have money today! I don't need to sell newspapers today!"</p>
<p>He patted his pocket, where small and large silver coins were fighting.</p>
<p>"Don't you want to add a better piece of clothing, Duzjikov?"</p>
<p>He was stunned, looked at his old aristocratic clothing, and seemed to remember something again, his face darkened; after a while, a bitter smile still floated on the corner of his mouth, and he slowly shook his head:</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>"I don't like to wear that classless clothing!"</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of instigation made him excited, pulled my shoulder, and said earnestly:</p>
<p>"Go! Let's go get drunk!"</p>
<p>The milky white glass door with "BAR" painted on it swallowed us in; the rainbow-like Avenue Joffre left outside the door was stunned.</p>
<p>"Number Three!" Duzjikov and I occupied a glass-topped seat, and casually called out like that.</p>
<p>The white-clothed girl who was called "Number Three" walked over, sat on the remaining stool, and stared at Duzjikov's face! Her face was dim and miserable.</p>
<p>"Oh! Here you are again, Duzjikov, didn't you sell newspapers tonight?" The white-clothed girl had no charm, no coyness, her face was worried:</p>
<p>"Anna, ah! Tonight! Tonight, what I need is not poisonous silver coins, tonight I want to get drunk!"</p>
<p>Anna brought two plates of pork chops and two glasses of scarlet alcohol.</p>
<p>Anna turned her head, her gaze fell on my face, nodded slightly to me, and then asked Duzjikov in fluent English:</p>
<p>"This………………?"</p>
<p>"This is a Chinese man who is in the same situation as us, Mr. Wang; and he is also a writer full of emotions."</p>
<p>Anna nodded to me again and asked me softly in fluent English:</p>
<p>"Where is Mr. Wang's home?"</p>
<p>"No home."</p>
<p>"Where is your lover?"</p>
<p>"No lover."</p>
<p>Duzjikov and I poured the scarlet alcohol into our hearts: one cup, two cups, three cups…</p>
<p>"Anna, dear," Duzjikov raised his very hot face; "Get me another cup!"</p>
<p>Anna was almost crying; she grabbed Duzjikov's arm, her voice trembling:</p>
<p>"My love, stop it! This place is made of money!"</p>
<p>Duzjikov's face became ferocious:</p>
<p>"Anna, Anna, ah! Isn't even alcohol allowed to me in this world?"</p>
<p>Duzjikov shook off Anna's arm, tears welling up in his eyes, and roared.</p>
<p>Anna had no choice but to bring another cup.</p>
<p>"Number Three!" A white man on the left seat shouted like that.</p>
<p>Anna stood up, forced a smile, wanting to go over, but was dragged by Duzjikov, muttering:</p>
<p>"Anna…dear…"</p>
<p>Anna smiled bitterly:</p>
<p>"Duzjikov! This place is made of money!"</p>
<p>Duzjikov watched Anna walk over, watching Anna throw herself into the white man's arms.</p>
<p>He turned his head, and said to me soullessly:</p>
<p>"Do you really have no home?"</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"Do you really have no lover?"</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"Ah! Haven't I lost my home; sold the love of my lover?"</p>
<p>To the mouth of the wine glass: "Let's drain this cup!"</p>

<h3>Answers to Several Legal Questions (3)</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I have repeatedly read the supplements, and I know that if apprentices have any difficulties, they can ask you, and you will answer them without exception. Therefore, I venture to ask you about my difficult questions, hoping that you will not hesitate to answer them for me.</p>
<p>My uncle passed away in 1923, leaving behind a wife and two daughters. The eldest daughter is now married, and the second daughter is also betrothed to someone else. However, my aunt has always been unrighteous, and two years ago, she had a private affair with another man in Shanghai. Neighbors and relatives all know about it. But because my aunt is unusually fierce, everyone is afraid of her. My father passed away nine years ago, and I am also young, so I have no power to resist. The five acres of ancestral land left behind have all been sold out, and she also wants to sell an ancestral house. I and my relatives did not allow her to sell it, so last year, when the eldest daughter got married, she said as an excuse, "I have no money to buy wine for the wedding, I have no choice but to sell the house." So I spent fifty yuan to pawn it, and wrote a pawn ticket. Now the house ticket is in my aunt's hands. If my aunt uses the house ticket to borrow money in the future, after borrowing, can I refuse to pay it back? Can my aunt's house ticket be invalidated? My aunt is having an affair with another man, what can I do to break away from her, so that she doesn't come to my door? Do I have any rights to the house? Please answer each question in detail. I hope you will reply to me. I respectfully ask for your peace.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Dong Yong</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>(1) If there is solid evidence of the field property left by your father, you can order the landlord to return it. As for the pawned house, the owner of the property can still mortgage it for borrowing or sale. The pawnee cannot interfere, but no further pawns may be set.</p>
<p>(2) The nephew has no right to interfere with his aunt's affair.</p>

<p>The man, smoking a cigarette, glanced at her, then fixed his eyes on the hole of the fire head, watching the black ointment swell up, listening to the sucking sound, and everything around the hole went into the cigarette holder.</p>
<p>Spitting out the last remaining smoke from his mouth, he said,</p>
<p>"It's always hard to say. Last time, I heard Wu Qiantai, the third boss, say a lot to our boss, something about cheap bones hurting the dragon, something about the decline of gold, and also dragged in a lot of imperialism. After all, I don't know what the reason is."</p>
<p>"Is it really the end of the world? It can't be, right."</p>
<p>"It's hard to say, maybe it's this reason. I heard old people say that before the Great Qing Emperor was destroyed, a real person came down to say that the world would be in chaos for thirty years. There are still eight or nine years left. It's really getting harder and harder to live."</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, when we were girls, the little maids weren't as bad as they are now. Now they all know how to talk about fashion, even fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls are bad, know how to be coquettish. And there are families that rely on this."</p>
<p>"Little girls are bad, but our wallets aren't up to par, so we can only drool."</p>
<p>"You're still so shameless, why don't you look in the mirror to see how old you are."</p>
<p>The two laughed happily for a while, giving each other considerable caresses, the shadows of the two heads merged into one on the top of the tent, and it took a long time to separate. The man's hand was still roaming on the hill, and the woman closed her eyes slightly, letting the man move.</p>
<p>"Third girl, will you still care about me when I have no money in the future?"</p>
<p>"Don't say these tasteless words." She glanced at the man with her eyes rolled back, and her heartbeat quickened.</p>
<p>"I guessed it a long time ago, what you would say in your heart." His hand was still roaming, and his mouth stuck to the woman's cheek.</p>
<p>"What I said in my heart is, 'My third girl only recognizes people, not money. People can buy on credit. Money can't buy everything.'"</p>
<p>The man was happy, and rubbed the woman crazily. The woman sucked on his mouth. Low, soft, tangled, and indistinguishable laughter flickered in the lamplight, swaying the hearts of the two people.</p>
<p>Triumph and passion were boiling in the man's heart, he said, "Third girl, don't worry, no matter how bad I am, I will never forget you. Little darling, put it away a little better, if I have money, would you be willing to leave Xu San and follow me?"</p>
<p>"If you have money, you will forget us. You won't just take the good ones and run away, don't哄me."</p>
<p>"I'm really not 哄ing you. When you go to burn incense on the fifteenth, don't forget to sue for me, and pray to the Bodhisattva to make a fortune."</p>
<p>"Speaking of making a fortune, cough, I had an interesting dream last night! I dreamed that I got a lottery ticket and got a thousand yuan. Strangely, you took away five hundred. Later, the money disappeared again. Dream fortune is lost fortune, is this how the dream is interpreted?"</p>
<p>"Maybe you're going to make a fortune this year. I'm willing to die this life if I meet someone who pays me back."</p>
<p>"You have to die in my arms." The woman looked at him, unable to help laughing in her heart.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's die tonight." The man threw the cigarette stick, indicating that he could remove the smoking set.</p>
<p>Third girl put away everything on the bed. She said that her husband was going home, and asked him to leave. But the man was clever, saying that he had already left her a piece of satin when he was inventorying, which was just right for making a jacket. She said with a smile,</p>
<p>"Looking at your filial piety." Before she finished speaking, she smiled and walked outside the room to latch the door.</p>
<p>Making the bed, she sat down in the corner by the wardrobe. Everything was in infinite silence, only the sound of 　　　　　 in the corner. The man took off his jacket on the table, and had already taken off his shoes and got on the bed. The woman stood up, closed the door, turned down the lamp on the table, put down the curtain, and went into the bed. The sound of lips licking leaked out from the cloth curtain.</p>

<h3>Hollywood's Major Stars' Valuations at the Start of the New Year (3)</h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>Now that we've finished talking about the stars at MGM, let's talk about the stars at Paramount. Paramount's most popular star right now is Mae West. Her voluptuous body and seductive movements first revealed her sensuality in "She Done Him Wrong," making people all over the world want to "Go West." Later, she starred in "I'm No Angel," which made people even more crazy. In this regard, in addition to saying that her market value in the securities market has soared to an out-of-control level, many film critics are unable to determine whether this phenomenon is permanent or just a temporary fad, and can only wait for her to release a few more films before seeing.</p>
<p>Bing Crosby was a new development at Paramount in 1933. Her price will definitely rise every time it is auctioned in the securities market. His musical comedy, like "Too Much Harmony," has already established his superior position in the film market. Marlene Dietrich was originally known for her "legs," and later for her "trousers"; although she had so much fresh publicity material, her price has fallen below the baseline in the past year. The biggest reason is that she has made too few films, and her films always feel the same. Someone used to compare her to Garbo, but now they feel that this comparison is too inappropriate. However, she recently starred in a big film called "The Scarlet Empress," and the time for her to restore her original position is probably here.</p>
<p>Another big star whose price has plummeted in 1933 is Maurice Chevalier. This fact is unanimously recognized by filmmakers and film critics. Or he himself also admits this fact, because he has automatically canceled his contract with Paramount and announced that from now on, he must have a script that suits his personality and style before making a new film. Recently, he starred in "Merry Widow" for MGM, which may increase his securities price somewhat.</p>
<p>The rest of Paramount's stars can be briefly mentioned. Sylvia Sidney has almost plummeted. Miriam Hopkins, Richard Arlen, and Fredric March can still maintain their reputation. Carole Lombard and Jack Oakie have made considerable progress. Gary Cooper, Claudette Colbert, and George Raft all saw a significant increase in box office revenue in the past year. The Marx Brothers can still maintain their appeal.</p>
<p>Speaking of the stars of Fox Company, we will first think of Janet Gaynor. She seems to be Hollywood's lucky star forever. Since the success of her "Seventh Heaven," she has steadily been the idol of American movie fans for many years, and until now, her position has not changed at all. Regardless of whether her films are good or bad, many of her worshippers also admit that some of her films are extremely bad, her tens of millions of movie fans will always crowd to buy tickets to see her. So she is still a very reliable collateral in the securities market for movie stars.</p>
<p>Warner Baxter's position is also very stable. His "Paddy the Next Best Thing" and "42nd Street" last year have increased his price in the securities market. Although he is not a heavily promoted actor, his name on the list of actors is the income on the filmmaker's books. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Lost Chord" (兰心，光陆)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Without pretense, this is a sentimental romantic work. It was most prevalent in literature in the eighteenth century, and in film, this trend still remains.</p>
<p>David is a musician who leaves his beloved lover for the sake of art. However, at this time, his lover, Montelin, succumbs to power and marries the Earl. When David returns to the country from the United States five years later, the Earl sees David and Montelin embracing and kissing, and angrily divorces his wife and takes his daughter to Spain. From then on, David went to Spain to duel with the Earl in order to win back the love of his beloved's daughter. The Earl dies, and he is also injured, losing the feeling of playing the piano with his right hand. His daughter, Joan, is taken to the United States, and his lover goes to a monastery to become a nun. Twenty years later, David and Joan meet, and she is already a famous stage actress, and he composes music for her. He and she fall in love from then on. After Joan and David's nephew break off their love due to a misunderstanding, on the eve of the wedding, they learn that Joan is Montelin's daughter, and they try to promote her marriage to his nephew, while he recalls his lover in the dark.</p>
<p>Sentimental romances often make people feel sad and depressed. In this respect, the author of "The Lost Chord" has indeed grasped this atmosphere quite well. Especially when David meets Montelin in the monastery, the mournful piano sound, monotonous in the silent air, can make people weep, everything is in the past, the past is like smoke, David has spent the long years in sad mood. Afterwards, due to the relationship with Montelin's beloved daughter, he once again feels sadness in extreme excitement. In the last mournful sound of the monastery, our protagonist makes people walk out of the theater with a sad and heavy heart.</p>
<p>However, although the director is dealing with a tragedy, the tone of suffering and exile is not as moving as the tone of sadness and depression. I think this is something that should be particularly pointed out. When he writes sad scenes, he often contrasts them with the joy of others. Montelin and David wept, while writing about the Earl and Sharon's flirtation. When Montelin is waiting sadly for David in David's room, he writes about the warm applause and cheers in the theater. David raises a glass to celebrate with Joan, causing Joan's sadness, while writing about the licentious guests singing loudly outdoors, etc. These scenes where human sorrow and joy are originally not connected are even more cruel and terrible in drama.</p>
<p>In addition, we can point out the characteristics of this film from the composition of the picture. Regarding the various scenes in the monastery, in addition to making people feel a sense of holiness and nobility, in the scene of the duel at the Earl's house, the entire composition is due to the stage-like device, which makes people feel nostalgic in this ancient castle.</p>
<p>Of course, this film has its shortcomings. This is not only to say that the scenery of the celebration is too fake, but more importantly, it is too concise. This is not the economy of cutting, but the connection of the picture is too simple and only uses dialogue to explain the plot. This stage play approach is undoubtedly very unsuitable for film. The other things are omitted.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Review of "Alice in Wonderland" “Alice in Wonderland” 丨Cathay丨</h3>
<p>— Di Ci</p>
<p>Lewis Carroll's famous fairy tale "Alice in Wonderland" has been brought to the screen. It was shown at Cathay during the Chinese New Year. Although it didn't cause a sensation like "Don Quixote," it still attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>I don't deny that children, like adults, need spiritual nourishment; nor do I deny that there are many fantasies in children's minds; at the same time, they often personify certain things. However, in any case, I always feel that in the name of children's literature, it is wrong to give children all kinds of empty stories without principle, and not to give them correct guidance based on their fantasies. China has never paid attention to children's literature. Many people are currently working hard to create children's literature, but what we see is more poison than tonic. This is the first impression I had when watching "Alice in Wonderland."</p>
<p>Carroll was a famous mathematician. He used his qualifications as a mathematician to write children's stories, so what "Alice in Wonderland" first gives children is logic and rich knowledge. This is why "Alice in Wonderland" has become a favorite of modern people, and it is not accidental. But "Alice in Wonderland" is, after all, an old fairy tale, and Carroll is sometimes confused by his own fantasies and prejudices. Therefore, in "Alice in Wonderland," we can only slightly see his dissatisfaction with reality, and there is not much reform significance here. Of course, people will defend him by saying that fairy tales are originally meant to organize children's emotions secretly, but what we need to pay attention to is what is used to organize them? And what kind of things are they organized into? Therefore, there is no question that "Alice in Wonderland" is not the novel and film that is currently needed.</p>
<p>The "Alice" on the screen is not much different from the "Alice" in the book, and the performance of many characters also follows the illustrations in the book. So, if we watch this film, even if we haven't read "Alice," it doesn't matter, because it uses extremely appropriate because it is a fairy tale, the director focuses on "fun." The "fun" here is not the kind of nonsense found in slapstick comedies. From the costumes to the movements, it already gives us fun, especially the elegant and light movements of several animals. Many of the heads have masks, so facial expressions are very lacking. The others are quite remarkable. At least in scenes such as going to heaven and earth, the movie expresses its unique function even more. The special use of time and space can only be done by movies.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to draw dogs and horses" because everyone has seen dogs and horses. "It is easy to draw gods and monsters" because no one has seen gods and monsters. Where should we start to criticize everything in "Alice in Wonderland" technically? We can only make general comments.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: This article was delayed until today due to the backlog of manuscripts after the Spring Festival holiday.)</p>
<h3>### An Accidental Anti-Hitler Film</h3>
<p>— Fu Xi</p>
<p>Since the leader of the National Socialist Party in Germany, Hitler, became Chancellor, he has greatly suppressed the Jews in the country, causing them to lose their jobs and property, and become homeless. Perhaps only the Jews who have suffered the misfortune know the tragic situation. Originally, since the rise of National Socialism in Germany, foreign films have suffered a major blow because they were difficult to import. Unexpectedly, Hollywood has recently produced a film full of anti-National Socialism, and it is feared that American films will be even more envied by the German government authorities. The film stars the big star George Arliss and is called "The House of Rothschild." Rothschild is the largest Jewish financial group in Europe, and its family's banks are spread all over Europe. George Arliss's film depicts the history between that great financial group and various governments. One section describes how, in the most prosperous era, the family "ordered" the Prussian government to restore German citizenship to Jews. Because the Prussian government wanted a large loan, it had no choice but to obey the financial group's instructions and order the restoration of German citizenship to all Jews. Although this story is a historical fact, it coincides with current events, as if satirizing the current German government, which will have to yield to Jewish financial groups due to poverty. Of course, the producers in the United States are doing their best to argue that the film has no malicious propaganda, but how can they get the understanding of the German authorities?</p>
<h3>"Raging Tide of the China Sea" Passes Censorship and Will Be Released</h3>
<p>Since the opening of Yi Hua Film Company, it has caused a lot of speculation from the outside world because it has not yet released any works. However, I dare say that this is a good phenomenon for Yi Hua. You must understand that other people's speculation is attention to oneself, then under the attention of others, you will naturally work harder to engage in work.</p>
<p>Finally, Yue Feng's "Raging Tide of the China Sea" was produced under such circumstances.</p>
<p>"Raging Tide of the China Sea" has been passed by the Nanjing Film Censorship Board and can be released in Shanghai recently. The film has profound performances, flexible shots, and interesting small movements. The strongman Cha Rui Long changed his style and performed calmly, which is indeed extraordinary. Yuan Meiyun's liveliness and Wang Yin's excitement can even more stimulate people's hearts. Indeed, everything in "Raging Tide of the China Sea" is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Of course, Yi Hua Film Company is showing the facts to people.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Film Novel Iron-Blooded Rouge (1)</h3>
<p>— Long Geng</p>
<p>Starring Wang Yuanlong, Fan Xuepeng, and Tang Jie Produced by Tianyi</p>
<p>The tiger in the zoo was exerting its strength to chew on the large piece of beef, a gift from Brigade Commander Gao Yan.</p>
<p>Gao Yan had an insidious face, with a monocle covering his left eye. The powerful gaze shot out from behind the lens, making him seem strange and frightening. The mustache on his lips was twisted powerfully. His teeth, like the tiger in the cage, protruded from his lips, as if he wanted to eat people.</p>
<p>Li Xuejuan, the wife of Battalion Commander Lin Zhenxiao, was strolling in the zoo with Shen, the wife of Zhenxiao's friend Lu Yuanfu. Unfortunately, Li Xuejuan's beautiful and lovely expression was seen by the lecherous Gao Yan, and a kind of ambition to "possess her" filled his chest at the same time. Therefore, he basely approached her.</p>
<p>Adjutant Ma Yunbiao was a friend of Lu Yuanfu and also knew that Li Xuejuan was Lin Zhenxiao's wife. Therefore, Gao Yan, who was full of thoughts of possessing Li Xuejuan, delegated the responsibility of "matching them up" to Ma Yunbiao.</p>
<p>Ma Yunbiao went to Lu Yuanfu's house, preparing to unload the responsibility of "matching them up" to Lu Yuanfu. Lu Yuanfu was an honest man, and he understood that Zhenxiao was his friend. In the friendship between friends, he should not erase his conscience to do this base and immoral deed. Therefore, he always could not allow it, no matter what "official" was used to seduce him. However, the fire of vanity burned Shen's heart. "Official," what a noble and glorious term. What does a friend count for! Finally, desire won, and she snatched the responsibility to bear.</p>
<p>Of course, Li Xuejuan did not understand that someone was hunting her body for fame and fortune. She only understood to serve her husband loyally. Originally, their couple was full of sweet and joyful vitality. They only felt that he was the one who could grow old with her forever. Of course, she was him in his eyes, but who would have thought? Misfortune was beginning right before their eyes.</p>
<p>Shen knocked on the door and came in, inviting Xuejuan to eat at her house, saying that many relatives were waiting. Although Xuejuan wanted to cook for her beloved husband, her husband Zhenxiao, for the sake of his friendship with his friend, agreed with Shen's words and went to her house. So, Xuejuan went.
