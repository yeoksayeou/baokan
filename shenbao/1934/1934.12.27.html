<p>近年來我國對外貿易頗有每况愈下之槪進口貿易之萎</p>
<p>口貿易亦大見减退。試以本年度十一個月出口總額論。共爲</p>
<p>較之二十一年度同期間出口總額七一五百萬元。幾跌落至</p>
<p>考其所以致此之由。雖曰因各國經濟恐慌。致使我國出口之</p>
<p>然我國在國際市塲方面。缺乏釜底抽薪之應付方略。或亦不無</p>
<p>係也。</p>
<p>在此世界商戰競爭之際。人各出其方法以謀我。日益加甚而我初無術以自衛。則勢殊可虞。今姑以對德關係爲例。據近訊。德國現巳實行統制貿易規定進口貨物之許可數量。同時。則仍限制該商人。須爲同量或相當量之輸出否則所收貨價。須以馬克存於德國。使果如是。則我國之對德貿易勢必受甚大之影響。目前我國各方面。對此問題。如何應付。當必在審愼考慮之中吾人固不必加以推測。然若各國因競爭商業之故。而相率效尤。則中國海外市塲。</p>
<p>所受之影響將更爲鉅大。故吾人不能以其僅屬對德關係而忽視之也。</p>
<p>夫振興國家對外貿易。基本方略。誠不限於一端。然大抵則不外於平衡國際收支大前提之下。首謀國别貿易關係之調整。以今日海外市塲日見狹小之際。尤有待於對外貿易問題之解决。而如德國者正謀互相親善。誠不妨與之恊商妥善方法。以樹立我國調整對外收支之先聲。蓋我國之對德貿易。本居於入超之地位。以一九三四年前十個月論。由德輸入者計逾國幣八千餘萬元。而向德輸出者。則尚不及國幣一千六百萬元。入超之巨。約達六千四百萬元。且我國輸往德國之貨物。主要産品不外爲蛋腸。以及鑛砂等。類皆未必能立於競爭不敗之地。若德國方面必欲我國出口商。以其貨價存於德國。其足影響於我出口貿易之發達。自不待言。此可注意者一也。我國對德貿易。本爲入超。由表面觀之。我國出口商人。誠不虞在德國無可採辦之貨物。然而問題之癥結。實不在此。假使誠照目前德國限制匯兌之方法。則我國之出口商或經營出口之銀行等。所獲非本國貨幣而爲德國之馬克。匯兌上所負種種風險與損失、非德國而爲我國商人。因是我國業出口者勢必裹足不前。而德國貨物之傳出。反有飛躍之可能。此可注意者二也。由上二點以言。我國對德出口貿易。雖其數量不逾一千六百萬元。（十個月）然在此海外市塲隨處可受人攻擊之時。若再加德國方面之片面限制。其影響實不僅此而止。故吾以爲中德貿易之關係。急須加以調整。以奠定一般貿易發展之初基。則我國商業前途。庶乎有望耳。</p>

<p>中聯社云、法國駐華公使韋禮敦氏、於前晚偕參贊杜格洛及華文秘書尤禮夫離京來滬、昨晨七時抵埠、旋卽赴法國總領署内法使館辦事處休息、上午十時許、卽偕參贊杜格洛及秘書尤禮夫兩人、赴中央銀行、訪晤孔祥熙氏、晤談約一小時餘、始辭出驅車逕回法領署、</p>
<h3 id="c118">會談商約 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>中聯社記者、於法使會晤財孔後、旋即赴法領署訪問、由杜格洛氏代表接見、據談、此次訪晤財長孔祥熙氏、係對中越商約中關稅稅率問題、交換意見、記者詢以京電有中越商約卽將簽字消息、是否確實、杜氏不肯表示、</p>
<h3 id="c119">磋商經過 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>查中越商約、早於王正廷氏任外長時、卽與法使韋禮敦開始磋商、旋卽因種種關係停頓、故記者嗣又往訪王氏、因王氏外出未晤、另訪彼時担任外部要職之在野某氏、探詢是時磋商經過、據答、中越商約、早於民國十九年、由前外長王正廷與法方重訂新約、業經我方批准、惟法方迄未批准、以致無法實行、現我國貨物輸入、須照普通進口稅繳納、致華産絲·茶·爆竹·陶瓷·五金·雜貨·一切均感難於行銷、故越南華僑團體、雲南商會等、均相繼電請政府、從速改訂新約、外部遂卽向法方再度提出交涉、</p>
<h3 id="c120">問題癥結 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>惟此問題、關係至爲複雜、而其重要癥結、則爲中越國境界綫及關稅問題、因中越領海公海漁區界域、久未劃定、我國漁船、因之動輒被受苛罰、當民國二十二年初、外部當局、因安南僑商屢請交涉、雖迭與法使韋禮敦磋商、終以關於新約互惠貨品問題、雙方意見參差、爭執迄未决定、至於關稅方面、法方又要求减低洋米進口加稅、我國表示不允、故此兩者、實爲修約問題久而不决之重大癥結也、</p>
<h3 id="c121">重開交涉 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>當法使韋禮敦氏前此返國、曾向其本國政府請示、此次回華、巳携來法國政府訓令、故於本月十三日由平入京、與我外部當局重開交不步、繼續恊商、現雙方意見、巳漸趨一致、預料是項商約、開年後不久卽可實行簽字也云云、</p>

<p>韋禮敦　駐華法使韋禮敦氏、由京到滬後、現已事畢、卽於昨晚十一時、偕秘書等離滬入京、駐滬法總領事梅里靄及副領事吕爾庚等、均往車站送行、該使於離滬前、曾於昨午往訪財政部長孔祥熙氏於中央銀行、對中法越南陸路商約中之互惠貨品一項、有所晤談、蓋法方現提議越米列入互惠貨品内、因之該使特於　昨午往訪孔財長、有所晤商、俾到京後續與外部談判、然後返平云、</p>
<p>有吉明　駐華日本公使有吉明氏、已於昨晚、偕書記横川、及情報處長蘆野、等一行五人、由滬掛坐夜快車專車入京、預定今晨抵京後、卽往訪汪兼外長、有所晤談、定二十八日晚、仍乘坐夜快車出京返滬、至情報處蘆野、則定元旦日、應該國外務省電召返國、</p>

<p>大通爲長江之内地口岸、招商·三北·寗紹·等華商、在該處均設有分局、靠置　船、以供上下水江輪停泊、貨客來往之裝、缷、此次招商局江安輪下水來滬、過大通時、未曾停靠、蓋爲航運安全計也、惟昨日各輪公司、巳接得該埠電告、大通地方安定、防務十分鞏固、長江輪船照常中以通行、貨物運輸旅客往來毫無阻碍、故本日起、長江輪仍運載大通貨客矣、</p>

<p>拆放現銀一千萬</p>
<p>申時社本埠訊、自美國購銀政策實施以後、我國現銀源源流出、本年自一月至十一月間、白銀輸出超數字、竟達二億五千餘萬元、迄上星期止、華洋銀行庫存巳僅三萬萬餘元、（二萬八千萬元二千八百九十萬兩）以致各方均感現銀涸竭之苦、工商事業、愈不能發展、因此錢業界領袖秦潤卿氏、深思熟慮、籌謀打開現有僵局之策、特與中央銀行副總裁陳行、中國總經理張公權、交通銀行總經理唐壽民等、商量拆放現銀一千萬元與各錢莊、由各錢莊對工商各界作抵押放欵、市面現銀旣多答心自可安定、因受謡傳而希圖窖藏現銀者、仍將脫手而出、市面現銀必更暢旺、中交各行庫存、亦因拆放而反充舒、現此事已由秦潤卿氏與張公權等在中央銀行、數度會議救濟辦法、昨晚、又在交通銀行唐壽民處集議此事、結果非常圓滿、申時社記者、探得此次會議結果、大體已經商洽决定如下、（一）中國交通二家各拆放四百萬元、中央拆二百萬元、合共一千萬元、（二）拆息暫定七厘、（三）需要現欵各莊、可分别各向三行接洽拆放、如需要更殷、或可超過一千萬元、但據金融界觀察、銀根雖似緊急、但以工商事業衰落、各方需要尚不甚殷、千萬鉅欵、恐已不能消納、</p>

<p>以人造絲白糖爲大宗</p>
<p>嚴加巡緝本年已稍减</p>
<p>華北沿海一帶、盛行一種「戎克貿易、」卽以大沙船裝載偷稅私貨、秘密進口、經營此種貿易者、多係一般奸商、與某國商人勾結、而以大連爲中心、每年由大連秘密運往華北各商埠之私貨、約有數千萬元、我國海關稅收損失之鉅、可以想見、兹據經營華北商業機關之調查、今年一月以來、我國海關因欲嚴行禁止偷運起見、特於天津·芝罘·威海衛·及青島各埠·增派海關巡艦、努力偵緝、結果、截至現在、共截獲偷運劣貨之沙船一百八十餘只、貨價約值一百四十萬元、惟秘密進口者、雖較往年减少、但今年總計仍有一千三百</p>

<p>中央社云、昨晨據本埠銀行界消息、日來本市銀根雖緊、但預測國曆年關内、銀錢界不致有變化事件發生、年關過後、滬市銀根、可以見鬆、銀行界當局、羣認外傳財部將减低銀幣成色等語、斥爲無稽云、</p>
<p>萬元左右、其秘密輸入之貨物、以人造絲占最大多數、除白糖二百六七十萬元而外、其餘一千餘萬元、槪係人造絲、惟華北海關如能繼續嚴緝、則此後偷運之風、勢將大减、</p>

<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請柬投靠情殷</p>
<p>當李士廉向賈多才介紹那兩個德國人的時候，他的初意，也最要替朋友裝裝面子而巳。他心裏想着，假如賈多才在西安要開設了銀行的分行，那麽，總也有要利用外國人之處，現在給他介紹得認識了，將來他想到認識外國人，是我的頭功，或者也有給我幫忙的時候，現在樂得作個伏筆。後來看到德國人的態度不大高明，而且說出要作買賣的那一番話，更是和原來的希望相反。便覺得有點對不住賈多才。雖是他不說什麽，只看他的臉色也就知道了。這就向他笑道：我倒不想他們是做生意的。要知道他們是這樣一路角色，無論如何，我也不會引他們來的。賈多才笑道：看你這樣子，好像是有點抱歉。這有什麽關係？買賣不成仁義在。而且建設廳方面，正也想在我們銀行裏挪動一筆欵子，去買幾輛渣油車，說不定就是買他們的吧？那麽，少不得也要和他們來往。李士廉聽說，倒是像脚後跟響了個大爆竹，大吃一驚，握了他的手道：什麽？你和這裏的高廳長也認識嗎？賈多才道：我們作銀行生意的人，總少不了和官塲來往。見面是朋友，不見面是生人。李士廉道：這話怎麽說？賈多才道：有事我才去會他們，他們當然也願意和銀行界人接近。反正沒有銀行界的人會去和官塲中人借錢的，可以放心和我們會面了。（一○○）</p>

<p>咱們一夥，是三個瘦子，一條綫搭着肩兒在行人道上走，嘴裏「哩哩啦啦」唱着，娘兒們見了遠遠地就讓開了。咱們笑，笑的心花也開啦！</p>

<p>鄰居殷先生家一家子的花錢，是很值得一記的。</p>
<p>殷先生是挺漂亮的一位西裝少年。凡是一切時髦的塲所，殷先生是沒有不曾涉足過的更其是跳舞塲，每個星期裏，至少得光顧三次。在這種塲所，雖然未見得非揮金成性不可，但至少總也不至於花一個子兒，得考慮一下，有多少重的了吧。可是殷先生，却就顯得有些兒特别。他在娱樂塲裏，花錢是很爽快的惟有坐黄包車，却每因一個子兒的爭執，不惜與黄包車夫一較究竟是誰的力足以勝人。</p>
<p>殷夫人是一個典型的上海式主婦，把聽戲，坐汽車，打牌爲日常生活的，而尤以打牌爲第二生命。三天不打牌，便會得甚麽都不得勁。打起牌來，儘可夜以繼日，輸掉一二十塊錢，滿不放在心上的。但是她也有一種特别的癖性，在小菜塲裏，也常和菜販因半個或一個子兒的爭執，而面紅耳赤的各辱着對方的祖宗萬代與子孫萬代。</p>
<p>殷老太太，就是殷先生的媽媽，也就是殷夫人的婆婆，是一位善眉善眼，吃素念佛的老太太。這位老太太，每年得上杭州去燒一次香，花掉一二百元，是不在乎的。此外，如修橋補路，建塔造廟，伊也總是慷慨解囊的。所以僧道尼姑之類，凡是捧了緣簿來募化的，殷老太太一開手，便總是三元五元，但是昨天這位老太太命一個大姐（女傭）去買線香，大姐打了一個子兒的後手，給伊查了出來，便痛駡了一陣。而且在今天一清早，便逼着那大姐收拾了包裹滾蛋了。</p>

<p>因爲如其摇得稍急，或稍不謹愼，往往會有好幾支籤同時落下來的：這樣就算來人的信心不堅的儆戒，對於他們自己或他們的家屬的病是很不利的，必須重摇。有時候摇得太急了，那末全數的籤也有一齊落下來的可能，這樣是代表大仙說，病入膏肓，不可救藥了。所以摇籤筒的時候，每個人都是十分小心的：碰到熱心的廟祝，他們還會從旁給你指導，這樣，你就不能不多給他一些香火錢了！丨丨摇到後來，少不得有一支竹籤會單獨的掉下來了，這就算是大仙冥冥中所指示的。於是便由求籤的人小心翼翼地看清楚了籤上的號數，告訴廟祝，廟祝便根據着這號數，替他們檢出仙方來。所謂仙方也和我們此刻可以在各廟中見到的籤訣相同，乃是一條條很狹很薄的黄紙上面，印着十幾樣的藥名：平時一疊一疊地用綫穿着，依次掛在壁上，需用時只要認清楚號碼，拉下一張來就行了。</p>
<p>病人或病人的家屬求到仙方之後，當然不敢怠慢，忙着趕到藥材店中去，丨大槪就到離廟最近的一家藥舖中去的佔多數，這些藥舖的生意，十九倒是從廟裏來的，店主人爲感激圖報起見，不免也要酬謝酬謝廟裏的管事或廟祝。丨照方配購；好在這些仙方上所開的藥，大都是力量很溫和微薄的，病人喝下去之後，就是不能見效，無論如何，也决不致馬上送命。所以仙方照例是不會闖禍的！（二一○）</p>
<h3 id="c203">銀夜壺 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>的確，地理學家說：「國家的文明跟野蠻，全在海岸綫的長短」。因爲海岸綫長，交通便利，文化的灌輸較易；海岸綫短，交通阻塞，進化自然難了。譬如英，日，德，法等國，海岸綫長，自然成爲文明之國：剛果，烏拉圭等，地處斐洲腹地，自然老是野蠻之邦。這是地理學家理由十足的證明。</p>
<p>但，咱以爲「國家的文明跟野蠻，全在夜壺的多少。」咱的理由，比地理學家，還要充足，何以呢？譬如住洋房的朋友，當然「文明階級」。他們有的抽水馬桶，洋瓷夜壺，公館洋房門口，當然不配陳列馬桶，更沒有陳列國貨夜壺之理。可是一到了内地坑厠林立，馬桶棋布，不是由此可以測騐該地的文野嗎？再到内地。到處可和夜壺見面，圓的，方的長的，橢圓的，足爲幾何學敎師的實騐敎材。瓷的，泥的，粗的，細的，淡描的，紫沙的，足見咱們貴國瓷器工業的發達。咱們只要欣賞坑厠旁蹲着的形形色色的夜壺·這地方的文野，不勞你老人家的調查，便可以知道了。</p>
<p>不知道從前那一位奉化人尋女人的開心，發明一種銀質鑄成的夜壺，作了新娘隨嫁的必要品。妝奩中要是沒有這件寳貝，便是算不得好妝奩。這銀夜壺的全體，是扁圓形；上有嘴口，大約直徑不過寸半，圓周是四寸六分。這樣精密的計算，却要發生一個嚴理的問題。因爲這件寳物，是男女共用的：男的當然不民問題，女人呢，咱却佩服伊們的「分寸恰好」咧。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3 id="c204">冬季家常蔬菜 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>時日是飛也似的過去，轉眼間早又過了冬至；朔風呼呼，臘鼓聲聲，一年又迅速地消逝了。年頭是這般蕭條，各業是那麽凋敝，然而一年光陰，絕不停留的流水般消逝。在這富室裏水汀巳煖煖地放着熱氣，而犬慈着家急賑捐欵，也巳捐有成數；平飯是開辦了，施粥廠也巳開幕，一粥一飯，平民們也可强飯加餐，不愁飢餓了。殺羽雖不敢說「先天下之樂而樂」，然而在負暄閒話、或圍爐清談的當兒，談談食譜，却也是應時佳話，何况又是家常菜蔬。</p>
<p>咬得菜根</p>
<p>「布衣暖，菜飯飽」；「咬得菜根，天下事莫不可爲」，可見一味菜根，共中大有文章！菜在冬季，正是當令時期，約略可分青菜，白菜，菠菜，薺菜，黄芽菜等五種。冬季的青菜，又大又肥綠油油的動人食慾。青菜除素煮葷食，都甜甜的好吃外，和米一同煮粥，燒飯，香香的别饒風味。兩碗菜飯，一客熟肉，曬着太陽，緩緩吃着，那種香甜肥美，眞是其味津津，咀嚼無窮。長梗的青菜，醃着吃，在初熟的當兒，顔色從嫩黄透出水來，滋味是略帶微酸，又嫩又鮮，眞是佐粥的一味好菜。</p>
<p>蘇州菜館中的「燜熓，」是一味獨擅勝塲的佳肴；那菜肴是白菜煮肉絲，可是肥腴酥爛，吃在口　中，津津有味，肴中的白菜，熓得爛爛的吃到嘴裏，可以入口而化，確是不同凡品。白菜和辣椒生醃，又辣又爽，可以佐粥，可以醒酒。</p>
<p>薺菜雖是野生植物，然而上得酒席，做得佳肴；和着冬笋炒食，是冬令絕妙素菜，炒鷄片，炒肉絲，也是其味津津。薺菜肉絲，還可包做「春卷，」也是當令的精緻黠心！</p>
<p>黄芽菜是菜中最乏味的食品，可是價值最廉，加辣醬同煮，頗可下飯，確是一味平民的經濟素菜。</p>
<p>雪裏紅與萊蔔</p>
<p>冬季蔬菜，除了五種菜外，「雪裏紅」與「萊蔔，」也有相當地位。雪裏紅的形狀，好似青菜，不過梗是細圓的，葉也毛毛的像鳥羽一般；雪裏紅生的有着辣味，須先醃過，將辣味醃去然後才可供食。那剛剛醃熟的雪裏紅，顔色是翡翠的般的明碧，咬在口中，又嫩又鮮，那股汗的鮮美，確非筆墨所能形容，眞是最好的一味粥菜。初醃的雪裏紅，炒食煮湯，葷素皆宜，像雪裏紅炒冬笋，雪裏紅煮魚片湯，都是筵席中的應時佳肴。</p>
<p>「太湖萊蔔，」這兩天肥嫩得像水梨一般，在這吃火鍋的當兒，很容易引起喉嚨毛病，生萊蔔就是治喉病的對症妙藥，生萊蔔和冰糖燉汁，還是治咳嗽的丹方妙藥。萊蔔切絲生拌，或和鹹肉煮食，都是很好的家常菜肴。</p>
<p>寺院中有一種叫做「春不老」的小菜，是將人參萊蔔略略醃過，然後和着橘皮青菜，一同切成細塊，塞入　中，大約過了一個月取出啖食，味脆而香，很可下酒。</p>
<p>在這辛苦了一年的冬暮，楊暉早巳說過：「歲除伏臘，烹羊庖羔，斗酒自勞。」冬季是人生享樂的時期，猪巳養得肥壯，魚也碩大無朋，就是鷄鴨等等，也都毛羽豐滿，肥大可食，大塊的肉，大條的魚，祇要有錢是吃之不盡，　　　　　　　而年頭是這般慘凉，旱災之下　　　　　　　　　根，巳是無上幸福，那班　　　　　　　　根恐怕也是無處掘食呢！朔風漸厲，深願圍爐取煖，斗酒自勞的人們，念及飢寒挣扎的災民，略節口慾，稍做善舉，那才是　上功德！功德無量！</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>充滿生機與活氣之民國二十四年，巳由滬人士與各機關公定爲學生國貨年。記者無他奢願，無他厚望，但願顧名思義，造成自有國貨年以來之罕前成績，于少要實踐下列六個目標：</p>
<p>（一）學生國貨年，全國學生一律服用國貨。</p>
<p>（二）學生國貨年，全國學校一律購用國貨。</p>
<p>（三）學生國貨年，全國學生之家庭一律服用國貨。</p>
<p>（四）學生國貨年，全國學生勸導所在地社會一律服用國貨。</p>
<p>（五）學生國貨年，全國學生一致發動勸導，凡是中國人，一律服用中國貨。</p>
<p>（六）學生國貨年，凡畢業之學生，務必以其所學，儘量貢獻，努力爲國貨界服務。</p>
<p>苟能切切實實做到上面六大目標·則學生國貨年之能事始盡、而學生國貨年之工作始有價值。空言，無益，呐喊，無益，做表面文章，更無益。吾儕今日，只有埋了頭，咬緊了牙齒去實幹，才有效果。</p>

<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>流光如駛，轟轟烈烈的婦女國貨年，已隨着時日而過去，而成爲歷史上的陳跡，我們默察一年來的成績，令人有不勝唏嘘之至；據報載全國十一個月裏，婦女化妝用品及衣飾用品，達二百萬元之多，而尤以給人猛驚的，在這二百萬元的數額裏，上海佔到四分之三强，計達一百六十萬元，以上海婦女界的發起的婦女國貨年，其消耗竟有這龐大的數額，這種的矛盾行爲，是值得人們的非議。</p>
<p>不過，也不能相責熱心發起的婦女們，她們固然是盡責的來提倡國貨，誰料一年來的成績如此，恐怕也不是熱心婦女們始料所及的罷？</p>
<p>過去的事情，我們也當作他死去一般，對於未來，希望婦女們，尤其是上海的婦女們，改過自新，未始不是「識時務者爲俊傑」，固然，愛美爲人類所天賦，但是，應當在提倡國貨的原則下來愛美才是呢！</p>
<p>末了，婦女國貨年已是過去了，婦女們不要以婦女國貨年的結束，視作責任完了，應該急起直追，庶幾於國家經濟，挽回鉅大利權，敬以此文，送别婦女國貨年。</p>
<h3 id="c235">婦女應永遠負服用國貨的責任 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 顔波光</p>
<p>今年的婦女國貨年，巳是强弩之末，轉瞬之間，要和我們分别了！那前進的時間軌道上，却早已寫了「學生國貨年」五個大字，顯明的，這是提倡國貨者不屈不撓的偉大表示，今年的失敗，還要收穫於明年的成功。</p>
<p>要而要知道「婦女國貨年」失敗的原因在那裏？一言以蔽之，就是因爲婦女們沒有脚踏實地羣策羣力去幹，尤其是一般小姐，太太，把自己應負的使命都忘記了，對於洋貨的崇拜，依然沒有稍稍革除，所以有脂粉香水入口數驚人的報告，鐵證的事實，給了我們失敗和痛心的敎訓。</p>
<p>可是「婦女國貨年」雖然和輕烟一般的消逝了，太太和小姐們，仍應永遠的負着服用國貨的責任！因爲婦女們，是家庭主宰，她負有敎養兒童的重任，帮助丈夫處理家政的義務，自己要有堅决的愛國心，把家庭内處理得井井有條，使家中洋貨絕跡，並訓誡兒女，不准購用洋貨，告以用洋貨的危害。使兒女們小小的腦海中，印入一個愛國的思想。這樣，在「學生國貨年」中，一定能收到實效。不然，縱使學生們怎樣努力，怎樣宣傳，還不是和過去的「五九」「五卅」抵貨運動的陳跡一樣嗎？所以在「學生國貨年」中，婦女們仍應負着責任，永遠的負着提倡國貨的責任！</p>
<h3 id="c236">學生國貨年中産銷應注意學生的需要 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 天希</p>
<p>民國二十四年，號稱爲「學生國貨年」。在學生國貨年中，我以爲國貨的産銷兩方面，應該注意到學生們的需要。</p>
<p>學生們的需要是什麽？在二十三年度的第一學期，敎育局已經告訴大衆了，從本年度起，學生須一律穿着制服；這不單是國産的呢布，該有大宗的銷路，還有附帶的零件，也是必不可少的。譬如：童子軍的黑色翻統毛襪，一人買兩雙，生意也就不小：可是我去替小兒買那種毛襪，跑了很多的襪廠招牌的商店，到了專賣國貨的公司，却找不到那規定的制襪。我問銷售方面的店員，何以沒有黑色的？他們的答復，大都是：「廠家不做那種貨色，我們就沒有來應市面。」我告訴他們現在有這樣的需要，初中男女學生，都要受童子軍訓練，他們可以和廠方定貨，一定有銷路的。上面這件事實，告訴我們的産銷兩方，還沒有注意到市面的需要：我以商店的進貨員和廠方的設計員，應該在看報的時候，留意敎育新聞，或許和他們的營業，是有關而且有利的。</p>
<p>知道了市面的需要，如果有我們國貨裏沒有的物件，又發現着倣造的可能。譬如：童子軍要佩小刀，據說，那小刀可就沒有國貨。與其偷着同行的關子，你去製造同樣的貨物，我也去製造同樣的貨物，同行鬧着非必要的競爭，結果或致同歸於盡，何不另闢生路？大學生中學生都需要保安剃刀，初中學生需要童子軍刀，請産銷兩方注意，去供給吧。</p>
<p>産銷雙方，應有最大的合作，共謀國貨的出路，這是一件還沒有完全做到的一件大事。在所謂「冬至禮物」的橱窗裏，最大的書局，陳列着錦盒的西式信紙信封，好像國貨的信紙信封，不堪展覽！民國二十四年的「學生國貨年」裏，我希望賣練習簿的書店和文具的，全採用國貨紙去做，誠意和産方合作；甘心去買洋貨的學生，如果眞有的話，因爲買來買去都是國貨，不用也自用了。</p>
<p>老實說一句，來結束這篇。上面所述的，是因爲替小兒去買童子軍制襪在路上引起的感想。</p>
<h3 id="c237">貢獻給蔣委員長 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>最近蔣委員長在離京的時候，曾經下了一道手諭，飭知南京市政府提倡國貨，略謂「一般國民，奢糜成風，服用什物，幾非洋貨不能洽意，以致國産事業日趨衰落，入超年有增加，若不嚴加糾正，積極提倡服用國貨。將何以圖國家之富强，民族之復興？以後務須責令一般國民，無論貧事，均應一律以服用國貨爲主，藉以養成全體人民之愛國觀念，而杜塞每年鉅額之漏巵」。這實在是一個很切要的問題，我們對於蔣委員長的這番意思，當然，能够領略。不過提倡國貨，並不是南京一地的事，所以我以爲蔣委員長應該推而廣之的通令全國官吏一律實行服用國貨。現在，我且貢獻幾點意見，給蔣委員長和南京的石市長採擇。</p>
<p>第一點：我以爲蔣委員長應該通令全國各機關，凡是穿着洋貨衣服的人，不許入辦公室辦公；不許參與一切會議；不許出席紀念週；不詐晋謁長官：如有故犯的，第一次記過：第二次罰俸；第三次撤職。</p>
<p>第二點：凡公用什物，一律不得購買外貨，其必須購買外貨的，（以無國貨替代者爲限）。必須先行呈請該管長官核准。</p>
<p>第三點：各機關應推選公正職員，組織國貨審查會，對於各該機關購用的貨物，均應詳加審查，如果查有疑義，或是證明實非國貨時，得呈請主管長官飭庶務更換。</p>
<p>第四點：各機關原有的洋貨，應該由國貨審查會加以證明，列冊存案，以後不能再行購買外貨。如以後發現有外貨的時候，國貨審查會應連帶負責。</p>
<p>如果能够這樣做的話、我想：提倡國貨一定會收到很大的効力啊！</p>
<h3 id="c238">介紹國産絲綿 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>氣候隨着時代的輪子而日漸寒冷了！關于我們冬令的禦寒問題，是急需要解决，現社會的一般人們，冬令服裝大都採用呢絨，旣不經濟，又不實惠，而且呢絨多係外貨，無形中又在造成一個個驚人鉅額的入超統計！我認爲國産的絲綿，至少可以代替呢絨一部分的需要，大凡用過絲綿的人們，誰都承認絲綿是輕軟溫暖，確是冬令禦寒的唯一妙品！</p>
<p>繭子，是剥製絲綿的原料；不過同是一個蠶做的繭子，品質也大有優劣，雙宫繭色白質韌，是絲綿中的最高品，最劣等的是用薄皮繭剥成的絲綿，色澤灰暗，性質鬆脆，功用也就差得多了！</p>
<p>絲綿本是浙西農家副産的一種，每年産額多的有一萬餘擔，價值在三百萬元以上尤以湖州餘杭所産的爲最優良，每年運銷外埠的爲數着實不少。</p>
<p>絲綿的功用，無論翻衣翻被，均極輕軟溫暖，而且年久綿舊併結，一經重翻，就可以輕暖如新，旣實惠，亦經濟，所以一部份的人們都增採用，不過在上海買絲綿，贋品次貨很多，鑑别優劣，極感困難，主要條件，總以纖維匀整，色澤光潔爲優等。一部份的綿商，往往在綿上滲雜骨粉鉛粉之類，以冀分量加重，色澤發白，這種絲綿外表極好，不過内質很壞，甚至一二年後卽不能復翻，購客務須注意：至於還有那滲用木棉的絲綿，内裏品質，那更糟樣了！</p>
<p>總之，絲綿是無可否認的是冬令禦寒的良好工具，在提倡國貨的現在，我認爲值得介紹讀者的。</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>－丨項康元先生的談話－</p>
<p>發展國貨事業的先决問題，當然以推廣出路爲第一個條件。許多人主張向國内發展惜年來内地農村破産，民生顚連，國貨不易推行。所以有的人主張向南洋羣島發展，因爲南洋方面，有華僑一千餘萬人，他們都很愛國，都喜歡服用國貨，可是國貨不易購買，簡直無處購買。要如趁這機會，向那方面盡量推銷，的確很有希望。但是推行的方法，絕不是廠商單獨進行所可奏效，必須合羣策羣力，先有集團的組織，然後纔能進行。關於這一點，項康元先生首先主張，認爲這是最有效的辦法。項先生的主張，也不是憑空而發的，他曾親自考察南洋的市塲，所見所聞，較爲確切，我便把他的意見，公開地發表，可作熱心國貨事業者的參考。（附註：此篇文字原爲曁南大學「中南情報」）發展南洋貿易專號而作）</p>
<p>（問）先生此番南遊的動機可否見告？</p>
<p>（答）我深知南洋羣島與我國關係的密切，很久以前，就想實地遊歷一次，並領略南國風光，可是職務所牽，久未成行。此次爲欲明瞭南洋商業狀况，並向敝廠董事長胡文虎先生報告廠務（按卽康元印刷製罐廠），纔决定啟行的。</p>
<p>（問）南洋羣島華僑貿易的變遷如何？</p>
<p>（答）據我個人觀察，南洋華僑貿易的變遷，到現在止，可以分作五個時期：</p>
<p>（一）華商販賣閩廣貨物，與土人交易</p>
<p>（二）華商販賣閩廣貨物，與土人交易</p>
<p>（三）華商販賣英國貨物，與土人交易</p>
<p>（四）華商抵制日貨，日商直接與土地人交易；</p>
<p>（五）殖民政府爲保護其本國工商業，實施限制日貨的輸入。</p>
<p>因爲南洋羣島是我們僑胞開闢的園地自來華僑的勢力，就一向非常偉大。到後來雖是政權被西人奪去，可是經濟權始終握在僑胞之手，大約五十年前，當地土人日用所需的貨物，幾乎全是由閩廣方面輸出的。僑胞旣都是閩廣人，本着愛鄕的觀念，盡量地把本鄕的土産向南洋土人方面推銷。而土人們覺得閩廣的貨品，到也新奇合用，自然樂於採購。在此時期，華商經營本輕利重的交易，所以藉此起家的不一而足。過有一個時期，歐洲各國的機器工業勃興，我國的天産品和手工業，都給他們打倒了，於是佔奪了華商原有的地位。這倒並不奇怪，達爾文的天演論，不是說「物競天擇，適者生存」的麽？我們的産品，不及他們的優美，也就不容你立足了。華商受此打擊，只得「迎頭趕上去」，來販賣西洋貨，尤其是英國貨丨藉此博得蝇頭微利，以維持他們的生活，自營商變作仲介商，就種下了西洋經濟侵略之根。近十年來，日本的工業，突然振興了，舉國一致高唱着所謂「南進政策」，便首先用經濟侵略的手段來做急先鋒，把工業品竭力向南洋傾銷，他們有政治的力量做後盾，運輸事業又發達，而且成本較輕，同樣貨物，價值較西洋貨便宜，自然爲當地土人所歡迎，於是南洋市塲的地位，又給日本貨覇佔去了。那時我僑商們也只得順風轉舵，從事於販賣日貨，曾幾何時，中日問題逐漸緊張，九一八事變之後，形勢險惡，邦交破裂，我僑爲良心所驅使，激發民族思想，實行經濟絕交的愛國運動，凡是日貨，一槪拒絕販賣，日本人眞是善於望風觀變，華商旣不合作，便設法和土人直接交易。日商富於市塲推廣的經騐，加以「價廉物美」四個字來引誘土人的注意，自然容易入手了。日商除在南洋各埠開設自營的商店以外，甚至内地村鎭，亦有日本商店的設立，門面佈置得很美觀，無綫電留機整天的開唱，幾乎把土人的靈魂都吸引去了，營業之盛，可以想見。更有無恥的西人商店，也有不少在推銷日貨的。要不是殖民政俯增高關稅的壁壘，那日貨簡直像水銀瀉地有無孔不入之勢。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c241">「相送柴門月色新」 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>廚川白村的「東西的自然詩觀」一文中，記載了一點很有趣味的事情，他說：「像那精通古文學，有十分敎養的作拉斯莫斯（ERASMUS），有人問他經過阿爾普山，看見了什麽，甚麽有觸於心的時候，他回答說：「不過是幽鬱的旅舍的惡臭，與酸死人的葡萄酒·」這種事實在他的壽翰裏寫着的。由瑞士往意大利去，載有萬古之雪的山嶽美，一點也沒有摇動他的心。」這種人未史太沒有感觸了。歐洲中世紀的高僧，當他們旅行於瑞士時，對於山嶽河流之美，據說是硬轉過頭去不看，而這種人又未免有點矯揉造作。其實文藝這種東西，本是隨着時代走的。我們這時代需要什麽文藝，便應當有什麽樣的作品産出。比如卽以農村的問題而言，古代的農村是與現代的農村不同的。現在還有憧憬着作田園詩人，如陶淵明一樣的「春秋多佳日，登高賦新詩。過門更相呼，有酒斟酌之。農務各自歸，閒暇輒相思。相思則披衣，言笑無厭時。」我相信現代的農民不一定有那種的樂趣。杜甫王維時代的農村是「白沙翠竹江村暮，相送柴門月色新。」是「斜陽照墟落，窮巷牛羊歸。野老念牧童，依杖候荆扉。」這是古代的農村的情形，我相信現代的農村，絕沒有那樣美麗的景緻，農夫們也一定沒有「相送柴門月色新」的那種閒情逸致。農夫的牛羊也許被土匪和丘八老爺下了鍋燉肉吃，荆扉也許被拆毁燒了火。野老也許正關在牢裏嘆氣，牧童也許早跑到都市裏來拉黄包車。搆成農村美的各種要素，現在都變了，七零八落的是什麽樣子，我們並不是生在農村的人，當然不大曉得，不過倘若我們閉上眼睛想一想，中國現代的農村總是不大好看的。我不大相信還有某一個農村是熙熙攘攘的過着好日子，有很肥大很美麗的公鷄在柴草上喔喔的啼着，有很漂亮而樸素的小女孩子對着生人嘻嘻的笑，院子裏有很好看的桃花，可以隨便進去折一枝，拿在手裏玩，渴了還可以進屋裏去喝碗水，趕上吃飯當兒，主人也讓你隨便吃點，還說「野老家貧只舊醅，」恐怕這時代早已過去了。我知道現代好一點的農村都有幾桿槍，面生的人去了，恐怕你是綁票的眼綫。夜裏四外槍聲呯呯噗噗的響着，如果都市中的田園詩人偶然到鄕間住個一天半天，他准想着這是大年夜的爆竹響。在田園詩人的眼中，一切都是美的，燒燬了的東倒西歪的屋，耕田的犂斜放在地頭上，青草比田禾還多，樹斫的光了頭頂，井也沒有人打水，上面放了一塊板子，這些在喝咖啡茶的田園詩人的眼中，也許以爲是意想不到的美景。他們也就同歐洲中世紀的高僧一樣，硬轉頭去不看這樣農村荒凉的景象，前些時看到了一段新聞，說東北某處徵求工人去作工，每日工資二元，待遇也特别好，於是有某處的農民，大家把家産賣了作路費，扶老携幼前去作工，直到某一個地方，遇着以前去的一批應徵的工人，說該處不但不給二元的工資，而且異常的虐待。大家一聽這話、互相抱頭大哭，因爲他們的生路已絕，有是回不去了，前路茫茫，實在不知去作什麽好，大家認爲除了哭之外，是沒有什麽辦法，於是只有哭，不然就是死！聽說有人正在設法救濟，我想也就是每人放兩個窩窩頭完事。可是放窩窩頭的消息，至今尚沒有聽見，大槪許就這樣消沉下去，也未可知！從這一小部分農民，便可以推測出中國現代農村的狀况來了，然而我們的詩人，我們的文藝家，還正在寫着「相送柴門月色新！」</p>
<p>十二月二十二日於津</p>
<h3 id="c242">聖誕音樂會 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 白舍</p>
<p>由於一個偶然的機會，我走進了門前豎立看美麗的聖誕樹的慕爾堂，跟那些穿黑衣的牧師與歌詩班的男女，白領巾之紳士與弦樂隊的指揮，臉龐純黄的聖處女，掛着金屬質的十字章的基督敎徒，大的ＢＡＳＳ，以及那些各式各樣的人衆「同來上籌稱觴。」我不說誑，這是我生到這麽大的第一次。</p>
<p>平素不大有餘錢購買音樂會的門票，而對於音樂偏又十分愛好的我，關於正規的宗敎味的音樂尤其領略得少，因此，這一次的走進，聖地」也可說是被一種好奇心所驅駛着的。</p>
<p>在典禮壯穆的裏堂禮就府之後，便有人把一份聖誕音樂會的說明書遞給我了，那是用上等中國紙精印的，我看了這，知道今天將要演奏的是彌賽亞聖曲（ＴＨＥＭＣＳＩＡＨ）。在中國還是首次公演，喬治·弗雷特立克·漢特爾作曲（ＧＥＯＲＧＥＦＲＥＤＥＲＩＣＫＨＡＮ）（ＤＬＥ），詞句完全是經文，是查利·陳藺嗣所選（ＣＨＡＲＬＥＳＪＥＮＮＥＮＳ），一共分做三部，第一部是預言和成就（ＴＨＥ　ＰＲＯＨＥＣＩＥＳＡＮＤＴＨＥ　ＦＵＬＨＬＲＮＥＮＴ），第二部是受難和得勝（ＴＨＥＰＡＳＳＩＯＮ　ＡＮＤ　ＴＨＥ　ＴＲＩＵＲＮＰＨ），第三部是復活和榮耀（ＴＨＥＲＥＳＵＲＲＥＣＴＩＯＮ　ＡＮＤ　ＴＨＥ　ＧＬＯＲＹ），頭上還有一節莊嚴，中和，快樂的序樂，當間夾着意大利客拉伯利亞地方農村相傳的古曲「牧樂」，全曲分成五十三節，是足足要用四個鐘頭的時間所能吟歌得完的長曲</p>
<p>我眞沒有想到，一個宗敎的潛在力會在人的心底發生了什麽樣的效果？但是在聽着歌詩班的歌聲之後，我似乎已得着了解答。當那單唱男高音的人歌出了驚人的吟聲，丨ＳＡＩＬＨＹＯＲＵ　ＧＯＤＳＰＥＡＫ　ＹＥＣＯＭＰＯＲＴＢＬＹＴＯＬＣＲＯＳＡＬＥＮＩ全塲的聽衆立時肅靜得沒有一絲聲息，滿堂揚溢着的是智慧，是能力，是尊貴，是榮耀，和頌讚，我要想不相信這世界會有所謂上帝的存在那是不可能的。我委實吃驚了不小，也可說已被這中和而莊嚴的聲調把全部的性靈都攝引去了，我不知道有我之存在，我祇知道這是一個充滿着古風的，智慧，尊貴，榮耀的環圍，這是基督的國，萬王之王的國。</p>
<p>這音樂會是循着次序一節一節的演奏下去，一陣女低音的低吟，我似乎聽着諸神之耳語，於是神秘的聖光在高高的十字架上眩　耀着了，亞當哪，夏娃哪，這是一片多美麗而豐滿的菓園喲·····。</p>
<p>弦樂忽然遲緩了，終於寂滅了，於是滿堂的人便哄起了，音藥會已告終。</p>
<p>走出這聖地，這王國，天空是下着細濛濛的微雨，我們，這些「同來上壽稱觴」的人，都頓時做了黑夜裏的羊羣，可沒有主的榮光在周圍照耀。在雨中立着待車的時候，我才閃電似的醒悟到：彌賽亞，聖曲，你音樂的精靈！你的「名字必要稱爲奇妙」，因爲你是全能。</p>
<h3 id="c243">從火山歸來（六） <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>偉大莊麗的火山</p>
<p>的地終於達到了！</p>
<p>一縷一縷的青烟，從不知深淵的山口裏噴出，我的精神突然興奮起來，脚步也特别來得快了。身子像小鳥一般輕盈，我一個人先走到了火口茶屋。</p>
<p>這是用木板搭成的一　茶亭·裏面可容三十餘人，有茶喝，也有水果和蘇打水賣，只是沒有飯吃。這時候　在火口茶屋内外休息的人，每個都帶着疲倦的笑容注視我，也有些老太婆，仔細地從我頭髮上望到脚跟去的。</p>
<p>有兩位站在火口茶屋和我們一路來的同學，我幾乎不認識他了原來每個人的面上罩上了一層黑灰的假面具。</p>
<p>火口茶屋是火山最高的山坵，噴火口還在下面。這一節路更難走了，因爲踏着尖銳多角的溶巖走路，一不小心跌了下去，皮肉會弄破的。這時我明白了剛才在沙漠中看到的血跡糢糊的臉孔，原來是在這裏受傷的，心裏雖在想着我應該望着地下小心翼翼地行走，而實際眼睛却遠遠地望着那從火口突突地冐出來的灰黑色的烟出神。</p>
<p>火山口到了！</p>
<p>精神突在地緊張起來！周圍的景色立刻變得莊嚴，偉大，陰森，凄慘。每個立在火山旁邊往下觀看的人，都帶着恐怖而凄顫的語氣說：「危」險呵！火口眞深呵！」</p>
<p>誰都沒有笑容，目力全集中在那不知深淵的黑漆漆的火口洞裏，也許其中有朋友曾經自殺在這兒的，他們的悲哀，傷感，更不是我們所想像不到的。</p>
<p>在我還沒有來火山之前，劍兒曾告訴我：「火山是不能去的，不知爲什麽，牠有一種魔力在引誘每個青年男女。凡是去過一次的，總是留戀火山，等到第二次去時，就將生命埋葬在那兒了。」</p>
<p>起初我絕對不相信這話，但一到那里，的確被偉大的火山所迷惑住了。我忘記了自身所負使命，忘記了人間，忘記了一切親人朋友，我想來一個悲壯的死，縱身往下一跳，以了結這苦痛艱難的一生：但特的影子立刻站在我的前面，他的莊嚴的臉色阻止了我有力的兩臂抱住了我，使我不覺地打了一個寒噤，往後退了一步。</p>
<p>「危險啊！」一個守山口的巡警對我說：他做着手勢趕我走開。</p>
<p>「米納沙，你不要和我們ＳＡＹＡＵＮＡＲＡ呀！」</p>
<p>楊女士雖然走得氣喘喘地，但還在向我開玩笑。</p>
<h3 id="c244">關於詩歌 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 君涵</p>
<p>做一個文藝刊物的編者，一定就會有這樣的經騐，在他的所收到的稿件當中詩歌恐怕要頂佔多數，但是，罕有成熟的作品！或是你高興到一個中學校裏去參觀，只要細心去流覽學生門辦的約刊和壁報，上面的材料也多半是詩歌，甚至多得使你驚訝。</p>
<p>爲什麽詩歌這樣特别多呢？也許因爲詩歌容易寫的原故吧？可不是？</p>
<p>現在，旣談到詩歌，你可得明白，首先要識别詩歌中用語的特殊性和適合於詩歌的思想。因爲思想跟用語是密切地而且不可分拆地合攏在一塊的，作詩的技術是拿文字把有情緒的經騐固定下來的。所以詩歌是有一種情感的，生動的，和隠喻的主要成分。旣然用文字把情緒的經騐固定下來，那麽詩歌便是感情的媒介。然而，這些感情跟經騐却是歷史的社會人類的感情和經騐。因此，詩歌不是屬詩人個人的而是屬於社社的産物。牠是一種抽象的，歷史社會的機能。同時牠以牠自己的形式反映着時代的特徵。廣泛地說吧，詩歌的社會機能之主觀和客觀的意義便是經騐和人格敎育之再現，羣衆心理之再現。</p>
<p>假如詩人知道詩歌是屬於社會的産物，恐怕他再不肯無病呻吟和粗製濫造了吧？</p>
<p>最後文藝刊物的編者先生們，倒不要因爲投來的詩歌多而加以疏忽，你們須認眞的取捨，詩歌多是生産的原因，恐怕不是由於詩歌易作，却是由於詩歌在現階段比較容易地表現現社會的感情吧？</p>

<p>— 林房雄原著靜子譯</p>
<p>大約過了一星期，他來了一封信。</p>
<p>（今朝，拾完了母親的骨，在一個高不足七寸壺中，都完全裝進去了。把這個壺擱置在面前，我深深感到這是一個頂大的打擊。</p>
<p>「在舉行葬式的時候，來了十個工廠裏的女工，那些大槪都是母親所鍾愛的罷。據說還有更多的人也是要求着工廠，最少讓她們在葬式時來一下，但是廠方當然是不答應。而她們都是明知要受罰而逃出來的。丨這眞是要使胸膛梗塞而苦悶的。</p>
<p>「正月放假，被母親禁止休學的時候，我曾經立下過計劃。我想進了大學以後，用自己的手找些事情幹一幹。這樣，我另外還有奬學金，就叫母親不再工作我母子二人也無疑的可以生活。這計劃鼓起了我的精神，給予我再進學校的勇氣！然而，如今，又復有什麽話講呢！</p>
<p>「骨壺擱在面前我這樣想丨丨想着眼睛看不見的力，把母親的生命靜靜的吸去的世間的組織。」</p>
<p>「逐漸瘦小的兩，逐漸肥大的絲綻丨丨」墨黑的蛹之死體！</p>
<p>「母親望着我出山，這是唯一的希望。我也曾留心着副其希望。我只管爲此目的而努力丨然而，如今呢！</p>
<p>「但是，我不絕望。在山中火葬塲中，靠着蠟燭燈光檢着母親骨頭的時候，突然腦筋中有了一個思想。我感到一條新路開通了。丨繭不祇一個！受苦不祗母親！</p>
<p>「就是我們住的這國家中，幾百萬，不，」幾千萬人們，好像沸湯中的繭似的，背後面有一條眼睛看不見的血筋，不時不刻的在吸取其生命。</p>
<p>「突然說了這樣的話，你也許以爲奇怪罷，但我知道作戰的對方了。詳細的事情總有對談的時候罷。往日在中學時，對於欺侮我的人拔刀對抗的事，現在忽然想起來了。但是我今後要進發的道路，却並不是那樣卑劣的路。是男子漢足以賭一生的工作。母親也喜歡罷。</p>
<p>「學校裏不再回來了，暫時不能與你會面罷。敬祈用功與自愛。</p>
<p>「還有，在我掉子左抽屜裏，有着一顆白繭。正是奇妙的紀念，這母親的紀念，我想敬呈僣你了。」</p>
<p>從此以後，巳有十年了罷。</p>
<p>就是現在我一看到繭子，不禁要想起了酒井康雄。然而，前面說過的祇能看到陳列窗内的月亮與蘆花，纔會感到秋巳來臨的都會人的我，幾乎已沒有看到繭的機會了。</p>
<p>但是，現在的，我因爲要記憶他，也沒有特别看繭必要了。（完）</p>

<p>（津訊）本市棉紗銷塲平淡、因氣候嚴寒、冰凍封河、客帮皆持觀望態度、但紗商心思觀高、以匯水狂升之故也、新集帮買十七支八馬紗十包、價爲一百八十一元半、統稅在内、香河帮買十支三喜紗一百四十七元、（統稅在外）</p>

<p>五金交易、昨因天雨綿連、殊不及先前閙熱、惟熱門貨如平白鐵剪口鐵本廠釘新鉛絲等、均有開出、但爲數不多、終以年關伊邇、銀根緊急關係、頗有結束氣象、惟久處岑寂之鋅皮、昨市情形頗有靜極思動之槪、兹將各花詳細商况、分誌於後、</p>
<p>（二號）　茶帮已有一二家採辦、故前昨二日聞已售出四十餘桶、價每擔廿七元七角半、比前又好起二角半、兵工廠已有問津、聞二三日内、當有成交消息、</p>
<p>（三號）　漢口帮辦去五桶、以作蛋箱之用、聞行情每擔售二十七元、查此貨存底單薄、行情有升漲可能、</p>
<p>（四號）　近來市盤低廉、故買戸採辦、查昨市開出三四桶、每擔估二十六元五角、　　（五號）　電池廠交易、因實銷困難故、需辦無多、每况愈下、計估二十六元左右、聞交易亦祇有十餘桶、</p>
<p>（六號）　爲長江帮之繁銷品、近來無甚交易、無準確市面可報告、</p>
<p>（七號）　數日中頗有開出、行情每擔估廿六元半、近因到多市氣頗有趨軟勢、</p>
<p>（八號）　本街虹口帮連日對於此種花色頗有拆進、行情每擔開價自二十五元五角至二十六元五角不一、查昨日全市成交、聞達五六十桶之多、</p>
<p>（九號）印刷廠及商務印書館昨日均有成交、價格初開二十五元、其後絡繹加至二十六元、查此貨存底奇少、行情又提加之勢、</p>
<p>（十號）近來購者甚少、市情頗爲冷落、行情聞數日來亦無甚開出、故少確實市面、</p>

<p>美國黄鷹牌黑鐵皮、爲搪磁廠之切需品、故各搪磁廠對於此種花色、必向美國購定、因其物質超優、性質柔軟、是以售盤超過市上普通貨以上、計每担估十二元至十三元間、而同業方面、除專做琺瑯廠及搪磁廠等幾家同業有購定外、其餘號家俱不採配、是以此種貨色、市上流通者極少、今庚搪磁生意不甚發達、故各廠購備之貨、亦較往年爲少、而最近各廠忽發生缺貨恐慌、因之紛紛向市上搜求、但底貨奇薄、致執貨者遂有壟斷居奇之念、是以行情猛抬不巳刻、估十四元、聞廠家方面、亦尚有少許採辦、</p>

<p>－明年開價都看漲面－</p>
<p>昨日紛市上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致呈堅俏之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好八角至一角零不等、坎拿大好八分左右、當開價時、本月份因祇客方之抽貨交易、亦頗活躍、故市氣俏利、遠期各月份、因廠家不抛、業外因有交易、致市氣亦見帶緊、迨至下午開盤、本月份交易、依然緊張、大有軋空之意、因現銷活絡、客戸抽裝仍緊、故喊價步步高昻、一二月份因本月份之良好、亦見帶振、餘則呈平靜之象、據業中推測、明年開價、或看漲面矣、結果本月份高漲三分二釐半、一月份漲一分半、二月份漲一分、三月份漲七釐半、四月份漲二釐半、五月份小二釐半、</p>
<h3 id="c263">麥價上落甚微 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>

<p>平稳之態、以洋麥報價、好八分至一角零不等、開價時本月份以結束巳近、多空交易、均有了結、市呈互擯、遠期因買戸不暢、趨勢盤旋、上落無幾、迨至下午開盤、初因紛市良好、漲起二三分、旋則獲利多頭回出、又稍回落、此後市面、如果粉銷仍活、當有帶振之勢也、結果本月份好一分、一月份好二分、二月分不動、三月份好一分、現麥市面、以到稀存底步薄、廠胃則尚活絡、高好貨起三五分、中次亦帶起二三分、開山東歸德麥四元零九分、次零五分、瑶灣麥四元零四分、次四元、六合麥三元九角七八分、高郵麥三元九角四五分、漢口麥三元八角三四分、由華豐申大去五千包云、</p>

<p>－内地本街去化均活－</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、因本客胃口又活、且前日跌價售開後、巳引起内地本街之問津、尤以西貢次米爲各方歡迎、行情立漲一角、其他暹邏機米碎米均帶好三五分、共計成交六千包、期米雙方擯持、只有回籠西貢二百噸、客秈邇日到存兩乏、内地與本街去化仍活、市乃步步趨堅、昨日下午尤見活潑、開出沙市米一千五百包、湘漢機糙五百五十包、價各帶好三五分至一角不等、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨河下各到船二三十號、市銷方面、因天雨之故、除去胃各色清淡、市價白粳高定、中次疲小數分、白元價形挺立、早薄較小三四分、羊杜共平定、埠客尖略形緊扣、</p>

<h3 id="c284">十五元一客大菜 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>前日爲耶穌聖誕節，世界各國，慶祝誕辰，舉國宫宴貧民七百人，德京招待貧兒萬二千人，奥國特赦示耶穌舍身救人的至意，上海因西人居留奇多，故歡當狂歡之夜，某園舞塲而兼大菜館的生意，非常興隆五元，而宣告客滿，舞塲中亦擁擠異常，酒綠燈紅，何世之槪。</p>
<p>十五元一客大菜，原不足爲奇，某飯店每客大菜有售洋三四十元者，有某飯店每客大菜售洋至五六十元者，此種大菜，只有各國要人和大腹賈來領敎，窮措大談不到去嘗試，據聞前日某園中，洋先生來領敎的，祇有十份之一而弱，而我國同胞去領敎的，反有十份之九而强，如此娱樂之塲，狂歡之夕，人生在世，勝會不常，「今朝有酒今朝醉，明日無錢明日無錢明日愁。」這原是幾位胸中像「遊火虫」一般明亮的先生們所幹的事。</p>
<p>語曰「富家一席酒，窮漢半年糧。」這句古話，現在還應當來修正一下，「富人一客菜，窮漢一年糧，」今年各處飢荒，災民之多，殊難計數，樹皮草根，不得一飽，而竟至餓死溝壑的，比比皆是，據昨日報載，義賑會派大批人員，出動各省放賑，蒙災者共十九省，今日起先赴皖贛等六省查放，賑欵須三千萬元，云云，因爲災民的多，所以就籌足三千萬元，每飢民能得幾何，倘是夜與會諸君，能省一客大菜，便是救活飢民數人生命，若加以跳舞之費，卽足以救活數十人，或竟至數百人的生命，眞是一朱門酒肉臭，野有凍死骨，」此種現象，何足以動諸君沉溺的腦筋呢？</p>
<p>「軟玉溫香抱滿懷，呀！劉阮入天台」此種迷魂的陣綫，那一個能打破，情願舍生廢家，以救妖艶姣冶的舞女，决不願省一客菜，少一回舞，而去救垂死溝壑的飢民，所以有人說人是感情的動物，我在這種地方看起來，决不相信這話有眞理，荀子說，「人之性惡，其爲善者僞民，」其言有些相像，所以「人之初性本善，」這種書籍，原是欺人之談，自應拉雜摧燒。</p>

<p>— 新綠</p>
<p>宋神宗熙寗三年。</p>
<p>是一個艶麗得化不開的春天。</p>
<p>潘金蓮走送了王婆。回進自己臥房裏，感到身上莫名的燥熱，汗像米漿似地從背脊間沁出來。</p>
<p>推開古老的百葉鳳尾窗，外邊沒有風，楊花飄着，飄着，棉絮似地。</p>
<p>「呵！已是落花時節了，那怪熱的天。」</p>
<p>她閒散地倚在窗畔，把小竹籤兒剔着牙，望望天際的白雲，計劃着怎樣去承受歡愉的明天呢？那俊秀的眼，那隆神的鼻，那頎偉而奇異的臉龐，那清亮而愛嬌的話語，啊！我底西門慶，我底摯愛的西門慶：你眞是我生命底泉源，靈魂底寳藏。</p>
<p>她微笑了，她慶幸她自己得到了勝利，居然能瞞住了名義上所謂她底丈夫實際上萎瑣得像一個孩子似的武大郎，而滿足地獲得了新的愛人。丨丨西門慶。</p>
<p>她盤算着，明天怎樣打發武大郎出門？又用怎樣地辭令呌他借宿在鄆城？他丨丨西門慶丨丨來了，應把怎樣大方而親切的方式來應接？欵待？又如何地把滿腔熱情向他申訴？如何地把萬般思相向他述說？她决定：先擁抱住了，吻他一個暢快；以傾洩五年來的幽苦丨丨丨不嫁給丨丨不賣給丨丨武大郎已整整五年了。</p>
<p>想到快活的時候，血液沸騰了她底全身，四肢百骨像被熨斗熨過似的那樣舒泰，輕快。</p>
<p>倐地又一個暗影，利箭般地痛嚙着她底心扉；「名節」，「婦人最可寳貴的名節！」她明白：一旦和西門慶愛上了，不僅要受到道義上最嚴厲的制裁，給予萬衆不恥的蔑視：也許罪惡的發現，更要遭到不忍料想的誅罰；而那殘酷的誅罰，將必然爲結束生命歷程的峻刑。她歇斯的黑地幻想着最後的不可避免的階段：似乎眼前罩籠着一層黑霧，在霧裏，自己已被捆綁在一輪小車，上由好個彪形大漢擁護了在街上游行；邊走，邊　喝，一路有無數的男女老小都朝自己戟指駡着：</p>
<p>「看不要臉的淫婦！」</p>
<p>「看毒殺親夫死有餘辜的淫婦！」</p>
<p>呵！淫婦，多可怕的淫婦，她猛地打了個寒噤，冷汗從皮膚裏直透出來，大夢初醒似的用力在腿上狠狠地獰了一把，自己輕輕喚着自己：</p>
<p>「潘金蓮！潘金蓮！你聰敏一世，休要迷朦一時，做出下賤的勾當來，貽羞祖宗！」</p>
<p>她把剔牙的小竹籤兒快速地咬斷，斬釭截鐵的表示跳出魔障的决心；她意識到：這是善惡分明的人獸關頭，她要向上，她要做人，她不得不忍痛撕棄了她和西門慶初戀底幽會，她隨手把掛在紫檀班竹床上的曆書打開，默誦着附在卷末的「玉歷感應篇，」企圖以皇道正神底法力，來消散那快要爆發的情感；可是事實上她雖竭力抑制自己不再去想西門慶，而西門慶底影子終縈繞在她底左右；使她沒有方法可以擺脫，霎時間腦海裏有千軍萬馬在奔馳着：</p>
<p>俊秀的眼···隆神的鼻···他偉而奇異的臉龐···清亮而愛嬌的話語···淫婦！淫婦！</p>
<p>波動的神經，棼亂得像一蓬毛柴團，她感到一陣難堪的窒息、痛苦地咬緊牙關；臉，像烈火似地血紅。</p>
<p>庭中沒有聲息，戴着晴朗的天。</p>
<p>春風裏，裊裊地傳來一闋歌聲：</p>
<p>「飮吧！這蜜也似的醇醪，</p>
<p>樂吧！這花也似的春宵；</p>
<p>青春不再，年華易老！</p>
<p>待他年流光暗換，</p>
<p>嬴得了白髮蕭蕭。」</p>
<p>她痴痴地聽了這歌聲，又嚶嚶啜泣了。</p>
<h3 id="c286">日頭打斜時 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 丁蔚南</p>
<p>炊烟是裊裊地在那邊林叢裏蕩了起來，在這日頭打斜的時候：有些柔和地是擁住了這些林頭，不讓人們看見，它抹的輕紅，有些是悄悄地透上雲端，慢慢地同化了在雲影的迷離之中，夕陽的返照底俄傾之間，而它是在大自然之間栩化了！</p>
<p>紅的霞暈，蒙住了這西方的天容，像沉醉了的飽飮醇醪的宴會者底面龐；這偉大的醉人似的龐廣的天空，是育孕了無邊底騷動。雲兒是那麽地流蕩的，可是有時也會漸漸地幻變在這蒼空，但她走近了這個傍晚下的西空，是會和和時下都市裏的摩登姑娘一樣是要抹一抹胭脂在自己的面龐。自然這樣的打扮，也是爲了要去媚惑蒼穹吧？</p>
<p>在雲影與天空俯瞰下的原野上，和凸起來的山峰上是散點着人與畜的小影，有許多白點子的顫動，自然這是羊羣了。有嘻笑聲和牧歌聲的唱起，這裏自然是幾個管牧的孩子了。那邊田疇裏的人們，當然是農夫了，勤勞地做着他們所期望的東西的成長，怕這日頭馬上的就掉下去，是趕忙地做着他們所必然的需要做着的事情。秋收現在巳經不</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>好，不去做着其他的，預備來春耕種的工作，是會更糟糕的。他們的心裏祗有幹，况且現在的「飢饉」是牢牢地粘在他們的身上。他們的負擔，有嗷嗷待哺的兒子，還有老的雙親的衰弱，還有寒冷的難熬，還有租稅的負擔呵，這些壓迫在他們，是免不了時時的要襲來，鬆一下手就會餓死：然而還會有更厲害的來到，那是莫明其妙的人禍，和悲慘的天災！現在他們是辛勤地做着，怕明日沒有的做，况且那可咒詛的日頭呵，它是在疲倦了，要躱下地平綫去休息了。那些烏鴉更是欺人的，嘠嘠地喚着牠們的同伴，「夜了，夜了，」凖備還巢去睡眠。雁羣也是一行行地向那天未飛去，在牠們羽翼下所扇起的，是帶來了乳白色的夜訊。</p>
<p>家裏的婦人們，是忙着煮晚飯了。曬在外面架上的衣裳和孩子的尿布都不見了。屋沿上的瓦雀，吱吱喳喳的預備到瓦弄裏去的以前，怕自己的同伴還沒有歸來，好像是在那裏呼喚着。廳堂裏的鷄兒們谷谷地都自己走到栖裏去，灰暗的屋裏是更見得灰暗，廚房裏的竈裏的鷄兒們谷谷地都自己走到栖裏去，灰暗的屋裏是更見得灰暗，廚房裏的竈裏的火紅紅的，鍋子裏在燒着菜，預備倦了的丈夫或自己的兒子歸來。</p>
<p>原野裏的孩子們，驅着牛見，驅着羊兒，吹着口哨茫茫的回家，關好了牛兒，拴好了羊兒，就朝着廚房裏跑，向母親姐姐嚷飯吃。有的到田裏去呌爸爸喊哥哥吃飯，天眞的他們的心，是不懂得爸爸媽媽的挣扎的！</p>
<p>這時候，夜幕是在高張，他們還是在胼手胝足地的忙着：曠野在糢糊，遠處的森林與山峰和自然是併做黑漆一團了。聽不見鳥的呌聲，只有鴟梟的暴戾的聲音，在黑林裏的嘯着，在開始牠的殘酷的行爲了。黯黯的，祇有夜的浮動，夜的脈搏，漲盈着他們的痛苦，他們的悲哀，他們的勤勞！</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>日前各報載有南京專電，文曰：</p>
<p>「司法院據青海高等法院電請解釋妾犯和姦，爲家長者有否告訴權疑義，業由該院統一解釋法令會議决，家長與妾旣非配偶關係，姜與他人通姦，其家長自無告訴之權，已電復知照」。</p>
<p>這是一件頗快人心的事體，在中國，納妾的風行，眞是駕列國而上之，凡是稍有財産的人，大都愛向這方面找快樂，討一個小老婆還不足，久而生厭，再來一個，二個，三個，以至無數個，如過去張宗昌竟不知他的妾有多少，到一命嗚呼，出面哭喪的還濟濟乎有二十四位之衆。至若納妾少至一二位者，大槪四海之内，多不勝數。前法學博士王寵惠氏爲解釋「有婦之夫與人通姦」之罪的不能明定，說中國人納妾者有十分之三，如欲科之以罪，處辦徒刑，將會全國都是監牢，所以不能够明定科罪。我想王博士這統計數目，當有七八成可靠，（他的這種議論對不對，是另一問題，此處不必談）這可見妾在中國之多矣。</p>
<p>現在司法當局竟有妾興人通姦，男人沒有告訴權的明定了，眞是大快人心的事件，這，我想不但妾們聞之雀躍弗巳，卽如我輩見了，也都會拍案呌好不置。（請恕我，不是我不懷好意）如此以往，深切的被壓迫幾千年來了的妾們，雖不能卽時奪回自身的人格，自由，獨立，也總得撒撒爛污了，比方一個年二八的嬌小的妾，配上一個鬚髮皆白了的老頭兒，單是性的一方面就絕對不能平衡，慢說滿足，這就很可以向外發展，軋軋姘頭，如果膽大的話，更不妨公開又公開，反正老頭子有法捉姦，却苦着無法起訴，只得「　石去喊天」哩。</p>
<p>愛納妾的男子們，你們曾否過見上面的那個專電。女人固然是好尋開心的，這却碰上了天大的釘子呵。</p>

<h3 id="c288">遺精的醫治方法 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：素仰先生爲迷路者之明燈，不幸者之導師。今有一個問題，特懇加以解答。我現在是十八歲。自去年識得一位女友，爲人和藹可親，因此我非常愛她，雙方感情極佳。近來她忽提議我倆婚姻問題，要求我一定娶她，但我却又不敢答應她，因爲我有說不出的苦衷。因蓋我在十六歲的那年，年幼無知，一時爲性慾衝動，引起了手淫，故患遺精病業已二年。現在約十天遺洩一次，且時有頭昏及精神疲倦之狀，深知病勢非輕，欲請醫診治。但又不知什麽醫生最適合？如不醫治，在生理上，對於結婚有妨礙在嗎？因爲我和她是至友，倘有妨礙的話，一旦結婚，我不是害她不淺嗎？上面的問題使我躊躇極久，因名譽關係，不敢對别人發表，特懇先生賜一答覆。又想世上與我同病的可憐者，一定很多，若蒙賜覆報端，則受恩者，千千萬萬，不獨我感恩不敢忘也。敬請撰安　　　　　　金品益上</p>
<p>編者按。一般青年由於外界的誘惑及慾念的衝動，很多犯了手犯，造成這種戕害身體的錯誤，身心俱感痛苦，懊悔莫及。不過我們認爲患了遺精，並不是不治之症，只要各人能够覺悟，能够有改過自新的决心，那末這種惡習總有革除的希望。</p>
<p>關於遺精，據編者所知，共有二種分别：一是屬於生理的；一是屬於病理的。生理的遺精是身健血旺精足必溢的現象，每月遺洩一次或二次在洩後毫無缺乏精神等等的病態。這種遺精不必醫治，在結婚後自然會停止。還有一種是病理的遺精，却要注意。病理的遺精，大都由於手淫，或日間的邪想，或看不正當的書畫等而引起，病症比較輕的是幾天一次，重的天天如此，最重者成爲滑，精無夢而遺，日間始偶發幻念，亦卽遺洩，在遺後頭昏目眩，精神疲倦，身體日漸羸弱，且有因此而絕嗣者。如不速予救治極爲危險。不過根據一般醫師所言，遺精一症，藥物很少效力，必須要自己堅决的剷除過去邪念及習慣，絕對不看不正當的書畫，不看某種有引誘性的電影及戲劇，同時在日間應利用正當的工作，儘量的勞苦自己的身體，以便到了夜間可以睡熟。或者又可以决定研究某種科學，將一切的思想都集中到這科學上去，不想别的事情。假使一個患精症的人能够這樣的從各方面實行根本的救治，那末他的病症一定會日漸痊愈。</p>
<p>金君的遺精是屬於病理的，但似乎還不重，所以他也不必過於担憂只要他能有决心實行以上的各種方法，我想他當然會恢復他的健康，享受人生的樂趣的。但是在沒有停洩以前，還是暫時莫談結婚爲佳。如對方有所誤會，可以先行訂婚，過一二年再訂期舉行婚禮。並且金君現在只有十八歲，似乎還沒有急急結婚的必要。</p>

<p>西人有句俗語、說蝸牛是不受外界侵擾的動物，祇有極大的聲音，他才可以聽得見。但是做電影明星的，不論中外，當然尤以美國好萊塢的爲甚，却無法享受那種清福。他們因爲地位的關係，常受到外界特别的侵擾。就是影迷們的崇拜，雖然是出於他們的敬仰之意，有時候反加增了他們的痛苦，所以一番好意，却變成了一番惡意了。至於影迷們的好奇之心，拿明星們當做籠子裏的猢猻一樣看待，那就更使明星們覺得難堪了。</p>
<p>瑪琳黛德麗許本來住食好萊塢是安閒快樂的，後來被一家報紙登載了她的照相，下面註出了她的住宅地址，於是每天去朝山進香的人，不知道有多多少少，步行的，坐汽車的，騎自行車的。他們時時刻刻去掀她的門鈴，坐在她的草地上，汽車門口横七豎八。有一天更不得了。那裏來了一家子的人，祖宗三代都請到了。他們將瑪琳的草地權作了紥營之所。他們所帶來的，有照相機，簽字本子，千里鏡，以及野遊的食物。到了中午，他們聚餐起來，開了一罐一罐的鹽橄欖，一聽一聽沙定魚，一瓶一瓶的鹹黄瓜，那些瓶瓶罐罐，以及紙包，鷄蛋殼，山芋皮等等，擲得滿地。小的跳着叫着。中的假裝採花，到窗口望裏張望着。老的睡着晒太陽，吸烟讀報。他們都等着明星出來見一見。他們等到深晚，沒有見到就走了。過了一個禮拜瑪琳黛德麗許就搬家了。</p>
<p>大家都說，鏡頭工作是明星們成名的必經之道。但是明星們却最怕攝影塲以外的鏡頭，尤其以美貌的男女明星爲甚。因爲在攝影塲中，攝影員一定要使他們拍得好看，角度適宜，不使他們的劣點有一些暴露出來。但是一到攝影塲的外面，他們就一些保障都渡有了。無準備的照相，巳成了一時的風尚。一班玁取明星們的照相的，一定要候明星們不在意，或極滑稽難看，或狼狽不堪的時候，所捐的才可以眩奇制勝。因此一塊錢買了一只鏡箱，所得的效果的惡劣，不亞於一個專家所攝的，而專家反要千方百計，去攝取明星們冷不防的照片。惟有這種惡形惡狀的照片，才可以賣錢。但是這種惡形惡狀的照片，就是明昨們所最厭惡的。不過他們却無法躱避惡意的鏡頭的襲擊。</p>
<p>獵取明星們的簽字，是和獵取明得們的照相，同樣的爲明星們所畏懼而無可避免的事。不巧的時候，一個明星被一個遊獵團包圍了，簽了半個鐘頭的名字都簽不完。這般簽字的獵者，包圍着攝影塲的門口，駐守在明星們的住宅左右，巡視着各飯店以及明星們所常出現的地方。和照相的人一樣，在馬路上，網球塲上，鬥拳塲上，無處不可遇見。最近瓊克勞馥遇見了一班人，在大街上將她的汽車攔住了不讓她走，直等到她簽了無數大大小小的名字丨最大的是簽在一件大衣背上的。看影戲，有的時候是明星們必須有的一種工作，但是遇見了一般好奇的人，就要走頭無路了。有一種人，叫做「試片前排狗」。他們在第一次公映的晚上。老早跑進了戲院，坐在緊挨着特爲明星們預算的座位的前一排。等到電燈滅了，電影開了，明星們亦來了，他們就不看電影掉過身來，跪在座位上看電影明星。他們光是看還不要緊，他們擋住了明星們的視綫。</p>
<p>羣衆的襲擊，亦是明星們所怕懼的東西。他們在登臺表演的前後，戲院的門口，以及攝影塲中，到處都可以遇見不測之事，比之這樣襲擊，簽幾個名字或是給人家拍些滑稽的照相，就覺和善得多了。茂立期希佛萊有一次剛出化妝室的門，就被一班中年肥胖的太太們所包圍了。她們自己介紹自己之後，就冷不防地先下手爲强，大家一齊動手，有的拉領帶，有的搶手巾，有的扯衣服上的鈕扣。希佛萊一看情勢不好，掉轉頭就望回跑。他逃進了化妝室，立即將大門關上。但是他想這班女人，能跑進攝影塲，一定是和生意經有關係的，他不能得罪她們，於是他就開了窗戸，向她們笑着打招呼，但是他却不敢再下去了。</p>
<p>新聞記者，在明星們的眼光中，却是敬而不敢遠之。他們一不敢得罪，二又不敢避而不見。誰要對待新聞記者傲慢無禮，得罪了他們，他們聯合起來，對你即不横肆攻擊，祇要稍稍消極抵制一下，那你就是自作孽，不可活了。最近凱塞琳赫本在紐約登臺之所以失敗，就可以作一個榜樣。推原其始，新聞記者之所以要跟在明星們後面採取新聞，亦不過出於一種好意，敬仰之心，情願作義務宣傳而已。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c296">評「再生花」丨新光 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>當「姊妹花」打破了中國影片賣座紀錄之後，曾經掀起軒然大波，因而引起若于電影作家重視了「姊妹花」的賣府原因，在其他作品也或多或少的受了「姊妹花」的影響，而「姊妹花」的作者在這盛譽之下，再來一個續篇，目然也不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>在抓取了廣大的觀衆來看「姊妹花」的一點上，當他們從來對中國影片不發生興趣的時候，「姊妹花」的作者確是很有功績的。同時，「姊妹花」在中國電影史上也是不朽的記載。然而使我們憂悒的是中國電影作家二味地迎合觀衆的傾向，不能勇敢的糾正過來。卽是說當觀衆們接受了電影，而作家們不能勇敢的進一步的提高觀衆的鑒賞程度。譬如說「再生花」中的一切，並沒有超過「姊妹花，」無論在那一方，它是和「姊妹花」同一窠臼的。</p>
<p>「姊妹花」是中國最賣座的有聲片，「再生花」也是有聲片，可是常人們看過了這兩部作品之後，並不感覺着十分滿足，當他們看過不少進步的外國聲片的時候。再說罷，觀衆們是需要高度發展的有聲影片的，譬如說「桃李刦」的成功，就獲得觀衆們不少的譖譽，於此可證明人們是要求中國聲片努力提高水凖的。</p>
<p>毌庸懷疑的「再生花」是和「姊妹花一一樣的，無論是内容或者是創作技巧。在這裏保持了作者一貫的作風，和「女兒經」的後一段一樣，那些所謂革命的說敎以及那種革命者的姿態，眞使我們不敢相信那是眞實的描寫。假使我們從劇中人的服裝上觀察，二寳之流的所謂革命的太太，當然是指現在而言，這在最時髦的旗袍上便說明了這一點。那末和二寳同時代的答莘園，譚志遠，王獻齋諸人所飾的官僚軍閥們，在作者的意思，都是應該被「革掉命」的。但是從北洋軍閥的服裝上，我們却又懂得，原來被革命的是前一代人，那些不三不四的革命英雄，却也是前一代的人物。······在這裏，作者的聰明，確是充分的表現出來。</p>
<p>此外，如剪接的比較零亂，對話的不够圓熟，都使本片沒有獲得充分的成功。其他從略。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c297">談談「重婚」 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>我剛從蘇州回來，就看見「重婚」在新光公映，我便給一位朋友拉去觀光了一下。</p>
<p>不錯，「重婚是吳邨入明星後的第一次貢獻，也是高占非和高倩蘋夫婦倆的初次合作。這故事的内容我們曾在「文藝月刊」上拜讀過王平陵氏的文章，然而今日在銀幕上和我們相見的却巳和文章上有很多的地方不同了：這也許是文章和電影不能同樣表現的原故吧？</p>
<p>這裏劇作者祗抓取了一個極平凡的故事，可是因爲處理的手法適當，和劇中人個性的生動，所以很能引起觀衆的同感。</p>
<p>它描寫一對鄕村中的老夫婦，克勤克儉的做人家，當他們送兒子遠出求學的時候，又追憶到二十年前他們夫婦的愛情和勞苦。他們熱切的期望着兒子做官上進，豈知兒子沉緬女色，竟在愛人面前稱父爲老傭人，最後終於被兩個女人控告了他的重婚罪。這個故事在畫面上的展開頗爲順利，調子的節奏也極平和。</p>
<p>導演在這張片子裏，對於鏡頭的處理和進展很費過了一番苦心，如烟管後面謝雲卿的兩個特攝，高倩蘋，嚴月閒，高占非三人的表情特寫，都是不可多觀的手法。</p>
<p>幽默的地方也很多，像謝雲卿的鄕下老，不識電鈴而一再去掀捺。大學生的生活寫眞，舞刊當作課外讀物，夜半踰牆出入，大胖子失足跌入大水缸，暗中摸索誤踏面盆，男同學抱着椅子學習跳舞等，實在逗人發笑，而裏面對於現代敎育的腐敗也作了一個針砭。</p>
<p>演員中要算謝雲卿最成功，嚴用閒面部的攝影太陰暗，其餘尚稱職。</p>
<h3 id="c298">「再生花」公映盛况 <a href="#c298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>「再生花」的劇情比「姊妹花」，更哀感動人，更曲拆惋轉。</p>
<p>姊妹花公映時，許多觀衆坐在影戲院裏感動得涕淚交流，從開幕起一直到二寳將大寳從牢獄裏救出來帶走之後，觀衆才稍爲放下心來。但煞風景，一種逢問又湧上心頭：大寳被二寳帶走了，其後如何呢？這就不得不看「姊妹花」的續集「再生花」了，因此無數萬的觀衆渴望着而今畢竟望眠欲穿的「再生花」公映了。於是新光大戲院的門口，每天車水馬龍，許多觀衆大有望洋興嘆之槪。想必「再生花」又要造一新記錄，替這岑寂的中國電影市塲振作一下。</p>
<h3 id="c299">「飛花村」賣座鼎盛 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>現正在金城大戲院公映的藝華公司歌唱鉅片「飛花村」，因劇中所描寫的一切都是現實，對於都市物質文明所造成的罪惡，有着大脆的暴露，對於農村婦女之因受物質文明所誘惑，致而發生變態的矛盾心理，又有着深刻的描寫，故頗受社會重視，自二十五日開映以來，觀衆異常踴躍，賣座之盛，與「女人」在太上海公映時之盛况相媲美云。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3 id="c300">風流寡婦（The　Merry　Widow）（三） <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 素華</p>
<p>外面等着他的女人，潮水般的擁過來把他包圍着。他笑着，唱着，瘋狂地吻着；可是當裏會知道這就是蘇麗亞？她在門口曉着他的狂態，裏面的人都當她是舞女來招呼她。一個剛從外面進來的舞女向她問道：「今晚有美國人嗎？」另一個舞女叫馬茜兒的亦向她說些舞塲的門　話。可巧瞧見了唐爾納，他跑過來吻她。他們就坐在一起。馬茜兒從腿上脫了一只很美麗珍貴的吊襪帶出來給她看，說是唐爾納送給她的。蘇麗亞接過來一看，裏面寫着的是「耶密贈與陶樂茜」。蘇麗亞心想這唐爾納實在是有些得人驚的。她於是說她自己的名字　叫菲菲。當唐爾納移近她的時候。她像很有經騐的說道：「今晚不大好，沒有美國人來。你是銀行家嗎？」「不是。」唐爾納答她。她很失望的說道：「啊！你不是嗎？我對於銀行家才合式的。你明白我的意思嗎？」唐爾納後來吩咐侍者替他開一間樓上七號房間的私人餐室他將她騙了進去。一位侍者拿着香檳酒和玻璃杯子進去之後，就退了出去，門也給關上了。她看了看這房間簡直是睡室一樣的佈置。這一來她又急着衝出去，幾乎連侍者也給她撞倒了。她不得巳又祇得退回來。唐爾納柔和地向她道：「若果你祇是歡喜銀行家的話，那麽這房間的門是沒有鎖着的。」蘇麗亞呆望着他。他對她的好意，她心裏是很明白。她慢慢地行近門邊、心裏在矛盾着去留的問題。這種情形可給唐爾納看出，。他起身把門鎖了，把燈熄了，他微進來。等了一會，唐爾納開門進去一看，她非特沒有換睡衣，還把所有的衣服都穿上了。「這是什麽意思？」他訝異着問。她指着墻上掛着的拿破崙像說道：「他在滑脫盧失敗，就是因爲他攻擊太早的緣故呢。」唐爾納氣得口呆目定、老羞成怒的說道：「他在滑脫盧夫敗，就是的，但是像你這樣就太不道德了。」他說完就怒冲冲地開門走了。他在房門外坐着發呆。馬茜兒來扭他也老不肯動。樓下醉人的音樂響了，動人的旋律，挑撥着每個人的情感。蘇麗亞開了門行近了唐爾納。溫柔地望着他道：「讓我們跳舞吧。」可是他粗暴地拒絕了。她祇得回到房間裏去。她是失望了，失望的情形和以前在自己的花園裏一樣。流着淚，她很後悔走到這裏來。門忽然開了，唐爾納走進來把她扶起，輕輕的說道：「我們跳舞吧。」起初他們像是很生疏的跳着。可是柔和的音樂，不久便把他們陶醉了。唇兒對着，睛兒望着。他們巳忘記了世上的一切。清歌一曲，蘇麗亞巳覺得不由自主。唐爾納小心地抱她放在床上。出神地看着她，他們都得着了無上的安慰。他俯下去吻她的時候，蘇麗亞熱情地問道：「唐爾納，你愛我嗎？」他覺得奇怪的答道：「一定的，爲什麽不呢？」她　望着他小心地再說道：「你要明白，我問你是否眞心愛我呢？」唐爾納快活地答道：「永遠」的，直到明天。」「過了明天便怎樣呢？」她問得有些恐慌了。「你倒有些滑稽了。」他停止了吻她抬起身來答着。她又問：「這樣的話以前有人問過你嗎？」「在這裏是沒有過，」他懶洋洋的答。她又問道：「你最喜歡這裏的女人，是不是？」（未完）</p>

<p>Construction Should be Implemented with a Definite Procedure</p>
<p>Rumors About the Silver Problem Are Groundless</p>
<p>Fenghua: A reporter interviewed Chairman Chiang today and received the following important remarks on economic and financial matters. (The following is a question from the reporter and an answer from Chairman Chiang.)</p>
<p>(Question): With the victory over the communists, various construction projects can be effectively promoted. On which aspects do you think we should particularly focus? (Answer): I believe that the promotion of construction projects should be based on the current state of the national economy and its potential development, with a definite procedure for gradual implementation. (Question): Recently, there have been many rumors in Shanghai about the silver problem, causing public unrest and affecting the financial sector. Are you paying attention to this? (Answer): These rumors are all fabricated by speculators. The Ministry of Finance has issued instructions to the Silver and Banking Association, making it clear that these rumors are baseless. (Question): What are your views on the silver export tax? (Answer): In recent months, the difference between international and domestic silver prices has been too large, and merchants are profiting by exporting silver. To prevent excessive outflow of silver reserves, the government has had to take remedial measures. Unfortunately, there has been much speculation in the market about the US silver purchase policy, leading to continued outflow of silver. However, I believe that the US government will take into account the close relationship between our country and the silver problem and take appropriate action. (Question): If the silver price in foreign markets rises further and silver continues to flow out, will the government adopt a measure to reduce the silver content of silver coins? (Answer): Such a measure would not benefit the country or society, and the government has no reason to adopt it. (Question): Recently, domestic silver reserves have decreased. Some people speculate that the government will implement a non-convertible paper currency policy. Is there any basis for this speculation? (Answer): A non-convertible paper currency policy is absolutely not suitable for China and would harm the interests of all the people. The government has no intention of adopting it.

<h3 id="e5">Xiang Chuan-yi Arrives in Beijing to Discuss the Situation of Establishing a Province in Xikang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiang Chuan-yi, Deputy Commander of the 24th Army, who was appointed as a member of the Xikang Provincial Establishment Committee, arrived in Beijing on the 26th. According to him, Xikang is underdeveloped, but it has mineral resources such as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead, especially lead production is good. Although there are many gold mines, they are mined by old methods, and the output is very small, so they are not developed. The total population of the territory is 3 million, which is less than the population of a large county in the interior. The reason for its inability to reproduce is the worship of Buddhism. If a family has three brothers, two of them become lamas, leaving only one to continue the family line. The same applies to larger families. Therefore, the population not only has no hope of gradual reproduction but also has the possibility of decreasing day by day. The entire territory is mountainous, and transportation is difficult. The natives trade by bartering. The tax revenue is particularly short, only about 400,000 yuan per year, which is the smallest tax revenue among all provinces in the country. The 24th Army in Xikang currently only has one brigade and one regiment stationed there. The rest are stationed in Suizhou and Ningyuan, more than 20,000 people each, in order to obtain food. Because of the inconvenience of transportation, even if there is rice to be transported, it cannot be transported to the destination in a short time. The issue of funding for the establishment of Xikang Province is quite complicated. Because Xikang's income is only 400,000 yuan, even military expenses are insufficient, let alone administrative expenses. After the establishment of the province, construction work must begin. At a minimum, several highways should be built. The area has towering mountains and steep ridges, and highway construction is not easy. What costs 200 yuan per mile elsewhere will cost no less than three or four times that in Xikang. In the future, the only way is to detour, extending the mileage and reducing the engineering difficulty, instead of adopting methods of tunneling and leveling mountains. In previous years, Zhao Erfeng managed Xikang, and Sichuan allocated 2 million yuan annually from the national currency fund to cover military and administrative expenses. Now that the central government's finances are difficult, and Sichuan has suffered from years of war, it is impossible to raise funds. Previously, I visited Chairman Chiang and President Wang in Beijing and presented the difficulties. Chiang and Wang also understood the situation very well and promised to find a way to raise funds. The establishment of the province will not be successful without a large amount of money and talent. I will visit President Wang in the next few days, ask for instructions, and then return to Sichuan. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>

On the 24th, it gathered more than 300 people to hold a meeting in Dayuzhuang. Zhao Hanchen, the head of the Cui Xinzhuang militia, and Captain Yang of the county company led dozens of militia police to suppress them. Before they left Cui Xinzhuang, hundreds of members of the Poor People's Party swarmed in, including more than a hundred holding guns of various sizes, and surrounded Chiang, demanding the previous amount of money for the militia. After Captain Yang mediated, a voucher for 350 yuan was written, promising to return it on schedule before they dispersed. County Chief Wang Xinggong dispatched the fourth district chief Lu Molin and Houjiaying branch chief Yang Yigui on the 25th to investigate this matter.

<h3 id="e20">Germany's Controlled Trade Policy <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, China's foreign trade has been declining, with imports and exports both showing a significant decrease. Taking the total export value of the first eleven months of this year as an example, it amounted to</p>
<p>Compared to the total export value of 71.5 million yuan during the same period of the 21st year, it has almost fallen to</p>
<p>The reason for this is said to be due to the economic panic in various countries, which has led to a decline in China's exports.</p>
<p>However, China lacks a fundamental strategy to cope with the international market situation, which may also be a contributing factor.</p>
<p>In this era of fierce global commercial warfare, everyone is devising ways to benefit themselves, and this is becoming increasingly severe. If we have no way to defend ourselves, the situation will be extremely worrying. Let's take the relationship with Germany as an example. According to recent news, Germany has now implemented controlled trade regulations, stipulating the permissible quantity of imported goods. At the same time, they still restrict merchants, requiring them to export the same or a comparable amount, otherwise the received payment must be kept in Germany in Marks. If this is the case, China's trade with Germany will inevitably be greatly affected. Currently, all aspects in China are carefully considering how to respond to this issue, and we do not need to speculate further. However, if countries follow suit due to commercial competition, then the impact on China's overseas markets</p>
<p>will be even greater. Therefore, we cannot ignore it simply because it only concerns the relationship with Germany.</p>
<p>Revitalizing national foreign trade certainly involves more than one basic strategy. Generally speaking, it is based on the overarching premise of balancing international payments. First, we must plan the adjustment of trade relations with individual countries. In today's shrinking overseas markets, the solution to the problem of foreign trade is particularly important. It would be beneficial to negotiate a proper method with countries like Germany, which are seeking friendly relations, in order to establish a precedent for China to adjust its balance of payments. China's trade with Germany is already in a deficit position. Taking the first ten months of 1934 as an example, imports from Germany amounted to more than 80 million yuan, while exports to Germany were less than 16 million yuan. The deficit is approximately 64 million yuan. Moreover, China's exports to Germany mainly consist of products such as egg casings and mineral sands, which may not be able to stand undefeated in competition. If Germany insists that Chinese exporters keep the proceeds from their goods in Germany, it will undoubtedly affect the development of our export trade. This is something to pay attention to. Firstly, China's trade with Germany is already in a deficit. From the surface, Chinese exporters should not worry about not being able to purchase goods in Germany. However, the crux of the problem does not lie there. If we truly follow Germany's current method of restricting exchange rates, then Chinese exporters or banks engaged in exporting will receive German Marks instead of their own currency. The various risks and losses borne in exchange rates will be borne by Chinese merchants, not Germans. Therefore, Chinese exporters will inevitably hesitate to move forward, while German goods may have the potential to spread rapidly. This is something to pay attention to. Secondly, Based on the above two points, although China's export trade to Germany is not more than 16 million yuan (ten months), in this era where overseas markets are vulnerable to attack, if we add Germany's unilateral restrictions, the impact will be more than that. Therefore, I believe that the trade relationship between China and Germany needs to be adjusted urgently in order to lay the foundation for the development of general trade. Only then can we have hope for China's commercial future.</p>

<p>the implementation of the reform plan for organizations in Manchuria, Prime Minister Okada issued the following statement in the form of a speech:</p>
<p>The issue of adjusting organizations in Manchuria has been resolved. New organizations suitable for the current situation in Manchuria have been established in both the central government and the local areas. This marks a new era in the implementation of Japan's policy towards Manchuria, which is a cause for great satisfaction. Japan's national policy towards Manchuria has not changed since its founding. Japan is an ally of the country, respects its independence, sincerely hopes for its sound development, and will continue to provide continuous assistance. Furthermore, Japan and Manchuria have an inseparable close relationship, and working together to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity is our fundamental policy. The Kwantung Province and the South Manchurian Railway Zone have a close relationship with Manchuria in political, economic, cultural, and various other aspects. Historically, they also have a deep connection. Therefore, the administration of the area should be closely related to Manchuria. As a result, the administrative organs and Japanese organizations stationed in Manchuria should cooperate and act as an organic whole. This is of great significance in the implementation of Japan's policy towards Manchuria. Therefore, the commander of the Kwantung Army, the plenipotentiary ambassador stationed in Manchuria, and the Governor of Kwantung have been held by one person. This system was originally necessary to cope with the situation at the time. However, in recent years, Manchuria's progress has been remarkable. The reorganization of politics and the development of industry and economy have made it clear that the system needs to be further improved. The organization of the agencies should be comprehensively adjusted to increase the organic connection function. At the same time, the government has also established a basic organization in the central government to implement the national policy towards Manchuria, in order to unify the administrative affairs of various departments towards Manchuria and facilitate the full implementation of the national policy. Comprehensiveness and unity are necessary. Since this summer, discussions have been held with various parties, and the establishment of this new organization has been carefully studied. During the process, there have been some twists and turns. Now, we are stepping into the first step of the glorious mission of the new organization. (I sincerely hope that the relevant authorities will do their best with a fresh and open mind, and work together to fully develop the organic organization of the Bureau of Manchu Affairs and the Kwantung Bureau, so as to achieve a higher level of effectiveness in the implementation of Japan's national policy towards Manchuria in the future, contributing to the happiness and prosperity of Japan and Manchuria, and further establishing peace in the Orient. This is my sincere hope.) (26th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Government Emphasizes the Trends of Political Parties</p>
<p>Military Spending in Next Year's Budget Increases Sharply</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 67th Japanese Diet held its opening ceremony today. The Emperor departed the Imperial Palace for the House of Peers at 10:30 AM. Members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives and government cabinet members held the opening ceremony together, with the Emperor reading the imperial rescript. The ceremony ended at 11:15 AM, and the Emperor returned to the Imperial Palace. (26th China United Press Dispatch) (Tokyo) Judging from the internal state of each political party since the extraordinary Diet, the government is optimistic about the future of the political situation. The government intends to pass the ordinary Diet without dissolution. Regarding the "bomb" motion since the extraordinary Diet, the government is taking its own independent understanding, and will somewhat increase the rural countermeasure expenses, so that the "bomb" motion will not be initiated and end. However, the statement of Justice Minister Ohara on the issue of human rights violations that was debated in the extraordinary Diet has not been implemented, and the preliminary examination has been repeatedly delayed. If the preliminary examination is not completed within the year, the Seiyukai will launch a fierce attack at the meeting after the recess, and a head-on collision may even occur. Furthermore, the refusal to participate in the National Policy Deliberation Council implies the possibility of rejecting the budget. Therefore, the government still attaches great importance to the trends in the political world. (26th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The outline of the general account budget for Showa 10 (1935) will be distributed to members of both houses and other parties on the 26th. Its contents are as follows:</p>
<p>First, when compiling the budget for the 10th year of Showa, there has been a large increase in the costs of replenishing the army and navy and the Manchurian Incident due to the international situation. In addition, disasters have spread across the country, and the cost of countermeasures has also reached a considerable amount. Although the trend of increasing expenditures is sharp, the natural increase in revenue has not exceeded the previous year. The profits of some industries have increased sharply due to the influence of the situation, so a temporary profit tax will be levied. However, the shortfall in revenue is still very significant, so the general expenditure is aimed at economy, and the issuance of public bonds is reduced, and the budget is compiled as follows: (1) Temporary Profit Tax Attachment Plan; (2) The expenses for improving military preparations are only calculated for emergency cases; (3) Although the Manchurian Incident expenses are mainly aimed at economy, the expenses for the air force and other military preparations in Manchuria are specially increased; (4) The disaster countermeasure expenses are calculated based on the regulations of this year; (5) For civil engineering projects such as water management and harbors, the necessary expenses must be calculated for the whole in cases where the situation remediation expenses have not been completed; (6) Other new items are only calculated for necessary items such as the exchange rate difference in the payment of interest on national bonds due to fluctuations in the exchange rate; (7) The shortfall in revenue will be made up by public bonds.</p>
<p>Second, the total amount of the budget for Showa 10 is as follows:</p>
<p>Revenue (Unit: Yen)</p>
<p>Regular Section 1,335,587,844</p>
<p>Temporary Section 857,826,445</p>
<p>Ordinary Revenue 101,174,765</p>
<p>Public Bond Funds 749,651,680</p>
<p>Surplus from Previous Year 7,000,000</p>
<p>Total 1,193,414,289</p>

<p>Will Legislate to Control Inflation</p>
<p>Silver Purchase Plan Will Be Prudent</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas, leader of the inflation faction in the Senate, has not actually withdrawn his original position on the Silver Bill, but today announced that he is willing to consult with other silver faction leaders in order to submit a unified monetary system plan in the next Congress. Thomas also stated that he will convene a meeting of silver faction leaders early next month to discuss methods of increasing the silver component in currency. The meeting may be able to decide on a monetary system bill that can achieve reasonable inflation results without the harm of usual inflation. According to Thomas, the rise in prices and currency inflation can be successfully controlled simultaneously by law. However, non-official monetary system experts in Washington expressed their opinion that the government will be very cautious about the future silver law due to the protest of the Chinese government and the slow progress of the silver purchase plan. Generally, the government will wait until the strength of the silver faction is shown before taking any action, so everything must be initiated by the silver faction first. Furthermore, the increase in the labor faction in the next Congress will also be an expansion of the conservative forces on the monetary system issue, because most of the labor side is against currency inflation. Some parties said that if the silver faction is strong enough, President Roosevelt may try to reduce the gold and silver components in the dollar at the same time to satisfy them. This method can avoid having to purchase silver from abroad and can only increase the domestic silver price. As for Thomas's original plan, there are two points, namely (1) to reduce the value of the dollar to five dimes in order to reach the limit allowed by the 1933 Gold Act, (2) to withdraw the existing nine currencies and replace them with one kind of paper money, with the gold and silver stored in the Ministry of Finance as preparation.

<p>(London) From Sandringham, the British Emperor broadcasted a Christmas address, communicating to the people of the British Empire with unity as the main theme. The Emperor spoke into the broadcast from his study, while members of the royal family, such as the Crown Prince, listened in the neighboring room via a transmitter. The Emperor's tone was fluent, without any hoarseness or stagnation. First, he extended his holiday greetings to the people of the country, then hoped that listeners would unite with each other in the spirit of a large family, and that the government and the people would unite. He also mentioned the impression of the expression of this spirit by the Emperor and Empress at the wedding of the Duke of Kent, saying that he was certain that if the people of the country faced all difficulties in the spirit of a family, there would be no difficulties to speak of, as the interests of individuals and parties would all be subject to the idea of seeking welfare for the entire population. Finally, the Emperor mentioned the self-governing territories and colonies, and reasoned with the people of India about his concern for them, hoping that the people of India would realize their position in a family group and cherish it. The Emperor's words were transmitted through various radio waves, spreading throughout the British Empire. It was heard very clearly in Canada, with every word and sound being very clear. However, the passage about India was somewhat unclear. Due to weather conditions, Australia was able to hear it, but not completely. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, this year's celebration is truly more grand than it has been in many years. Every family has a Christmas tree, hotels and bars are noisy all night long, and other stores are open until late at night and are still overcrowded. The revitalization of the domestic market can be seen from this, and the progress of the international situation also has a stimulating effect on domestic commerce. On Christmas Eve, all the churches in Berlin were full, and those who arrived later had no room to stand. The former Crown Princess also led her two sons to worship in a Catholic church in Berlin. Leader Hitler took a plane to Munich to dine with more than a thousand loyal old friends, and Hitler also gave each of them gifts afterwards. General Goering gathered 500 children in a certain place in Berlin and gave each of them gifts, and the crowd cheered and called him "Uncle Goering." All the winter game venues are full of tourists, and the prosperity of hotels and railways is also unprecedented in previous years.

Moreover, the travel business of various railway and airline bureaus has also broken the records of the past. Christmas mail has also greatly increased, so the public opinion unanimously regards it as a sign of the widespread progress of the national economic situation. The fact that is valued by the newspapers is also the revival of the shipbuilding industry, and the number of contracts for building ships has increased to more than three times that of last year. The stability of the domestic political situation and the easing of the external situation are also unanimously mentioned by the newspapers, and the talks between Foreign Minister Simon and French Foreign Minister Laval are cited to prove that the relationship between Britain and France is becoming more and more harmonious. As for Japan's tearing up of the Nine-Power Treaty and the repeated failures of the naval conference, although they cannot be ignored, the general trend of optimism is not slightly hindered by them.

<p>Bloodline and Land Are Secondary</p>
<p>(Berlin) For months, German political circles have been promoting the slogan "Bloodline and Land" to rally the German people behind the Saarlanders' vote in January next year. However, it would be more appropriate to replace this slogan with the word "Steel." While the return of the Saarlanders and the Saar land to their homeland is deeply emotionally moving and in line with the theories of the National Socialist Party, the Saar's annual production of two million tons of steel and one and a half million tons of iron is even more important. Considering Germany's population, the addition of 800,000 Saarlanders represents an increase of 1.3 per thousand. In terms of land, the addition of 1,900 square kilometers represents an increase of 0.4 per thousand. However, the industrial output of the Saar region will greatly increase Germany's production. According to official German statistics, after the Saar region belongs to Germany, cement production will increase by 32 per thousand, ammonia by 64 per thousand, coke by 83 per thousand, coal by 88 per thousand, asphalt by 109 per thousand, crude oil by 124 per thousand, steel by 181 per thousand, wrought iron by 186 per thousand, and pig iron by 232 per thousand. The Saar coal mines are rich, with reserves reaching 90 billion tons and an annual output of 13 million tons. This is something Germany will never forget. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>

The Abyssinian government also sent a message to the League of Nations, asking it to pay attention to the activities of Italian troops in Abyssinian territory. The message stated that after Italian troops occupied Af Duba, they are now building a road from Lati Er to Adu and Gherlogubi.

<p>Important Raw Material for Manufacturing Armaments</p>
<p>(Manila) In the provinces of Zambales and Southern Camarines in the Philippine Islands, chromium ore deposits containing millions of tons have been discovered, and the quality is excellent. This discovery was reported by Mr. Harman, the general manager of a mining company, to the U.S. Senate Investigating Committee (the committee, led by Senator Tydings, arrived in the Philippines on the 9th of this month, and its mission is to study various economic issues and the business relationship between the Philippines and the United States after independence). He explained that chromium is an important raw material for the manufacture of armaments, and it is almost completely absent in the United States. Once the production of chromium can be controlled by the United States, it will be beneficial to the maintenance of world peace and the stability of the Far East. Therefore, from a political and military point of view, this discovery is of great value to the United States. The report concludes by stating that after the independence of the Philippines, the United States should still maintain a permanent political and economic relationship with it.

<h3 id="e48">Construction of the Ministry of Communications New Building <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The new building of the Ministry of Communications has been completed and has been fully moved into for office work. Regarding the construction process, the reporter learned from the new building of the ministry that it was designed and supervised by architect Yue Long, and Shanghai Xin Feng Ji was the contractor. Construction began on July 20 of the 19th year of the Republic. It was interrupted for a long time due to the major floods of the 20th year of the Republic and the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents. When Zhu Jiahua took over the ministry the year before last, there was a proposal to stop construction during the national crisis. After consultation with the architect and research by lawyers, it was said that a contract had been signed, and the construction had been going on for two and a half years. There was no reason to abandon it halfway in law or in fact. Moreover, it was found that the contract price was agreed to be paid in eight installments. Because the payments were made on time, six installments had been paid by the time of the suspension of work. Only two installments remained, but the project had been suspended for a long time due to various reasons, and only 20% had been completed. The price paid had greatly exceeded the value of the project, and it was impossible to terminate the contract. Therefore, it was only possible to urge Xin Feng Ji to continue the project as soon as possible according to the original plan, so as to complete it as soon as possible. It was interrupted several times due to the strike of two people, and it has only been completed to this day. The reasons for the delay are mainly due to the contractor's insufficient capital, poor performance, and other unexpected events. As for the auxiliary construction and interior equipment, efforts have been made to save money. For example, the eight electric elevators originally planned have not been installed. Even the furniture currently used in the entire building, except for the auditorium and one or two reception rooms, is all original and has only been repainted. In addition, the Post Office Headquarters, the Postal Savings Headquarters, and the Long-Distance Telephone Engineering Office of the nine provinces were all located separately in the past, and the expenses were very large. In the future, joint offices will be established, and expenses can be saved, and administrative efficiency will also be improved. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Industry, the annual production of tobacco leaves in Xuzhou, Henan, is about 500,000 dan, which are sold to domestic tobacco factories. The factories used to use 60-70% American Virginia tobacco and 20-30% Xuzhou tobacco. This year, the American tobacco harvest was poor, and the price was higher than last year. Shanghai factories are competing to buy Xuzhou tobacco leaves, and the supply is less than the demand. Some are even shipped to the United States. However, this year's production is only more than 200,000 packages, and there are few left now. This is an unprecedentedly good situation. It is found that the tobacco leaves in this area are planted using American Virginia seeds, so they can be sold in the United States. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Excellent Business After Government Took Over Navigation Administration</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Hubei Province has suffered from frequent disasters in recent years, leaving no time to save the dying, let alone speak of construction. However, due to bandit suppression and work-for-relief projects, many highways and telephone lines have been completed, and inland river navigation has also been effectively rectified. The following is a record of the three major constructions: highways, telephones, and navigation administration.</p>

However, the counties in Southern Hubei, although they have been installed, have been destroyed by bandits and are currently being planned for reconstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Navigation Administration <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The province's navigation affairs, apart from the Wuhan Ferry, which has five ferry lines and twelve upper and lower docks, carrying 50,000 passengers daily and generating 40,000 yuan in monthly income and is directly managed by the Construction Department, the other inland river navigation, eastward to Wuxue, westward to Yichang, southward into Hunan, and northward to Xiangfan, are all controlled by shipping merchants. In the spring of this year, the Fuyuan and Huitong ships and others successively had accidents, drowning 2,000 passengers. The Provincial Government then ordered the Construction Department to manage and operate on their behalf. A total of ninety small vessels from various companies, those that were not damaged, fifty-seven steamships, and nineteen diesel ships, were allocated to run on twenty-one routes. There are eleven important routes: (1) From Hankou to Wuxue, 214 kilometers long; (2) From Hankou to Cangzibu, 65 kilometers long; (3) From Hankou to Liuzhi Store, 63 kilometers long; (4) From Hankou to Shashi, 519 kilometers long; (5) From Hankou to Zhuhe, 193 kilometers long; (6) From Hankou to Maojiakou, 240 kilometers long; (7) From Hankou to Pengjiachang, 135 kilometers long; (8) From Hankou to Shayang, 297 kilometers long; (9) From Hankou to Changjiangbu, 111 kilometers long; (10) From Hankou to Tianmen, 183 kilometers long; (11) From Shashi to Yichang, 137 kilometers long, totaling 2,153 kilometers.

<p>Over 30 Million Yuan Worth of Excessive Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies Abolished in Various Provinces</p>
<p>The Crucial Policies of Land Registration and County Budget Preparation Are Currently Underway</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, recognizing the decline of China's economy and the bankruptcy of the rural areas in recent years, and deeply feeling the hardship of the local people's poverty and financial exhaustion while reorganizing the national economy, proposed two resolutions during the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee in February of the 23rd year of the Republic: reorganizing national land taxes, first conducting land registration, and reducing land tax surcharges to provide relief to rural areas. The General Assembly passed the principles and the National Government ordered the Executive Yuan to issue three methods for reducing land tax surcharges and abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, which were reported to the Ministry within the deadline, so that when convening the National Finance Conference, the financial authorities and expert members of various provinces and cities could earnestly explore compensation methods and agree on the types and scope of local taxes in order to determine concrete measures. Subsequently, the National Finance Conference opened, with a total of 193 representatives from various places attending, and as many as 127 proposals were made. Apart from the (1) Reorganization of Local Finance Case, (2) Land Registration Case, and (3) Reduction of Land Tax Surcharges in Various Provinces, with Deficiencies to be Supplemented by the Central Government, which were discussed by the Finance Committee, there were 25 cases related to the reorganization of land taxes and reduction of surcharges, 34 cases related to improving the tax system and abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, 36 cases related to determining local budgets, and 39 cases related to other items such as rectifying the currency system and providing financial relief. After seven days of deliberation, concrete plans were agreed upon for conducting land registration, reducing land tax surcharges, abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, and reorganizing various local finances, and a Reorganization of Local Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies Committee was established within the Ministry, with supervisory committees established in various provinces and cities to enhance effectiveness. Subsequently, the National Government issued a clear order on June 8, stipulating that no further land tax surcharges should be added forever, and no illegal taxes and levies should be established again forever. On the 25th of the same month, it further issued a clear order specifying six categories of illegal taxes and levies and four stages of reorganization, all of which were forwarded by Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi to all provinces and cities for uniform compliance, all of which were the principles determined to reduce the burden on the people after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee, and also the concrete measures formulated to reduce the burden on the people after the Second National Finance Conference.</p>
<p>After the abolition of yellow taxes and miscellaneous levies and the reduction of land tax surcharges, local expenses would be insufficient, and without the central government's prior planning to supplement them, they would inevitably be inadequate. The most noteworthy of these is the issue of compensation. However, the central government's finances are also not abundant, but the central government and local governments are originally one entity. Within the possible scope, no matter how difficult it may be, we must find ways to consider the local situation. Therefore, Minister Kong allocated a portion of the national tax revenue to supplement local finances at a time when the central government's finances were extremely difficult, so as to avoid the fact that the decision could not be implemented due to lack of compensation. For example, the tobacco and alcohol license tax was entirely assigned to the provinces and cities to take over and collect at the beginning of the current fiscal year for compensation. In addition, the stamp tax was originally a central government tax, but after submitting a plan to the Executive Yuan for approval, it was decided to allocate a portion of it for compensation, with the Ministry collecting and distributing it, allocating 10% to the provinces, 30% to the counties, and 20% to supplement remote and impoverished provinces, and changing it to be sold by post offices to eliminate the previous abuses of contracting and apportioning. Reinspection methods were also stipulated to prevent missed postings. If handled properly, local funds in the future will inevitably become more abundant. In addition, the Ministry of Finance also sacrificed approximately 2 million yuan in revenue from the national treasury each year to abolish the parcel transit tax as an initiative for local areas to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies.</p>
<p>In order to uphold the late Premier's legacy of relieving the suffering of the people and seeking its thorough implementation, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued and urged all provinces and cities to uniformly comply with the above resolutions. In the months since then, various provinces and cities have successively reported the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies and land tax surcharges, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Chahar, Gansu, Suiyuan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Guangxi, Yunnan, Beiping, and Weihaiwei, a total of 23 provinces and cities, abolishing approximately over 3,000 types of taxes. The amount of taxes already abolished totaled over 28 million yuan, and those about to be abolished amounted to 9 million yuan, totaling over 30 million yuan. The 30 million yuan in tax revenue abolished were all the blood and sweat of the people, as well as all the burdens of the people. However, the Ministry of Finance authorities believe that China has a vast territory and many types of taxes, and there are still many that have not been reduced. Therefore, they are still encouraging each other with local authorities to continue to move forward, allowing no trivial details to remain and ensuring that no one is deprived.</p>
<p>As for the long-standing abuses of land tax in our country, which are deeply rooted, the reorganization of land cannot be delayed. The late Premier said, "If the land problem is solved, the Principle of People's Livelihood can be solved." However, the implementation of national land measurement and equalization of land rights cannot be done in a short time. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance, based on the principles agreed upon at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee, first conducted land registration, formulated a 35-article outline, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval for all provinces and cities to prepare for implementation. At present, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Guizhou, Suiyuan, Shandong, Sichuan, and Qinghai provinces have already begun preparations.</p>
<p>Annual meetings and monthly summaries are a constant part of the national economy. Without a budget, there is no way to find any trace of fiscal order. In the past, local budgets were either not established due to unrest or because government orders were not able to be universally applied, and the budgets of various counties were even more unfounded. After this finance conference, all provinces also ordered counties to implement the preparation of budgets. At present, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Gansu, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces have begun to prepare county budgets, and the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and Hebei have also convened small group meetings of county magistrates to actively carry out the work, which has achieved considerable results. Other items such as reorganizing various legal taxes and levies, reforming the land tax collection system, unifying accounting, and reorganizing debt payments, although the situations in various provinces are different and not entirely the same, are also gradually being improved according to local conditions. The following is an appendix to the general outline of the reorganization of various provinces for the reference of those who care about China's finance.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province: Jiangsu has always been known for its wealth. Before the ninth year of the Republic, revenue and expenditure could still be offset. After the 13th year of the Republic, military affairs were frequent, military salaries and taxes were heavy, debts increased daily, budgets gradually fell short, and the finances of various counties were insufficient, and funds were raised at any time due to events. Land tax surcharges and excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies increased at any time. After the Second National Finance Conference closed, various resolutions were implemented. Regarding the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, the first batch of tax cuts amounted to 100,174 yuan, the second batch 132,707 yuan, and the third batch 95,521 yuan, totaling 328,402 yuan. Regarding the reduction of land tax surcharges, there were five counties including Yixing, totaling 137,976 yuan. Regarding the determination of budgets, 3,040,000 yuan was cut.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province: Zhejiang Province is also a wealthy area in the southeast. Before the tenth year of the Republic, revenue and expenditure could barely be balanced. After the 13th year of the Republic, wars broke out repeatedly, gradually losing the balance. As of the end of June in the 13th year of the Republic, the accumulated debt owed over the years had reached more than 400,000 yuan. This year, in accordance with the steps of reorganizing local finance as resolved at the finance conference, all counties were convened to hold a financial small group meeting on issues such as reducing land tax surcharges, abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, and reviewing general estimates. Regarding the land tax surcharge portion, 800,796 yuan was scheduled to be suspended upon expiration, 498,687 yuan had reduced tax rates, and 304,554 yuan was completely exempted, totaling 1,604,037 yuan. Regarding the tax portion, after investigation, there were 457 types involving excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, with an amount of 247,511 yuan, all of which were scheduled to be abolished uniformly from November 1.</p>
<p>Anhui Province: Anhui Province is located in the center of the Yangtze River and is not a poor province. However, due to repeated banditry and natural disasters, finances are becoming increasingly depleted. Currently, the Department of Finance has reviewed and approved methods for reducing illegal taxes and levies and those not approved or not for urgent use, including more than 70 types of miscellaneous levies, amounting to 67,632 yuan, 286,891 yuan in land tax surcharges, and 117,347 yuan in miscellaneous tax surcharges, totaling more than 470,000 yuan. There are also more than 150 types where income is considered excessive and trivial, but the expenditure is still legitimate, totaling 283,997 yuan, which are also scheduled to be abolished within the end of this year after other compensation is found.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province: Jiangxi Province did not establish a budget from the 18th year of the Republic onward. The 19th and 20th years had no budget. All financial revenue and expenditure were disorganized. The tax situation was complicated, and coupled with the disturbances of the Communist bandits, there was no source to open. Therefore, the principle of thrift was adopted, and the budget for the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd years was prepared based on income. For the past three years, it has been able to meet the budget. Regarding taxes, starting from the 13th year, the production tax on bamboo, wood, paper, summer cloth, medicinal materials, and oils was exempted first, totaling more than 500,000 yuan. Land tax surcharges were reduced by more than 3,100,000 yuan, and excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies were abolished by more than 1,200,000 yuan. At the same time, a legal business tax was planned, and the original bandit suppression and post-disaster donations were abolished.</p>
<p>Hunan Province: The finances of Hunan Province have been declining due to repeated bandit disasters and natural disasters. The revenue is insufficient, and the expenditure is huge due to the construction of highways and other unavoidable projects, resulting in increasing deficits. The provincial local budget for the 23rd year, with revenue and expenditure each totaling 14,087,543 yuan. Although the revenue and expenditure figures are suitable, the actual expenditure is definitely more than this number. In addition, the drought this year has made the revenue feel even more insufficient. After the resolutions of the Second National Finance Conference were promulgated, the Hunan Department of Finance immediately sought to reorganize them. Among them, local miscellaneous levies are the most burdensome, and the ones that cannot be completely abolished for a while are the two items of regimental defense and education. All miscellaneous levies total more than 50 types, with an annual income of 1.6 million, which has recently been abolished uniformly. Regarding land tax surcharges, it is planned to reduce the regimental defense surcharge by 8 jiao per tael, reducing 900,000 annually. As for the surcharges that still exceed the regular tax, it is planned to reduce them gradually over three years, reducing one-third each year. The temporary donations of various counties, townships, and towns have also been strictly prohibited. A total of 390,000 yuan has been reduced in counties such as Liling, Cichun, Rucheng, Xinhua, Dayong, Qiyang, Chenxian, and Hengshan.</p>
<p>Hubei Province: Hubei Province is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in a strategic location, and commerce is prosperous. Before the 20th year of the Republic, revenue and expenditure could be maintained. After the abolition of the Likin tax in the 21st year, revenue decreased sharply. In addition, the Communist disaster and floods made finances even more difficult, reducing 10,000 yuan to 18 million yuan. Starting this year, we will follow the order to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. The first batch will abolish 27 types of old miscellaneous levies in Yichang, Shashi, Xindi, Wuxue, Laohekou, Fancheng Shayang, and other commercial ports, with a donation amount of 286,000 yuan, which will be abolished on July 1. In addition, 221 yuan was cut, and 62 types of miscellaneous tax items in 39 counties, including Puqi, were abolished, totaling 451,984 yuan. The Wuxue commercial port continued to abolish two types of donations from salt merchants and wharf donations, totaling 250 yuan. The above four items have jointly reduced more than 1,258,400 yuan. The remaining land tax surcharges exceed the regular tax, due to the need for funds or related to education, and those that cannot be abolished temporarily before compensation is obtained must also be reduced separately in accordance with the rules and within the time limit.</p>
<p>Henan Province: The finances of Henan Province have gradually gotten on track after repeated reorganizations. The annual revenue has increased from 5,283,694 yuan in the 19th year to 13,696,313 yuan. Various expenditures have been greatly reduced, and the comparison with the previous year has reduced a total of 2,535,671 yuan. Revenue and expenditure are sufficient to offset each other. However, due to the need to deal with river control, road construction, and rural revival, the expenditure is slightly difficult. Efforts are still being made to abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. More than 300 types of provincial and county miscellaneous levies have been abolished successively, and 46 types of land tax surcharges in various counties have been investigated and exempted. Now, we are also planning to continue to abolish (A) all existing miscellaneous levies in various counties, which are considered illegal or too excessive, a total of 32 types, totaling 264,572 yuan, to be abolished by the end of the year; (B) all deed tax surcharges in various counties that exceed half of the regular tax, totaling 234,915 yuan, to be abolished uniformly starting from the 24th year; (C) all types of donations and various taxes and levies that do not belong to the previous two items, totaling 352,019 yuan, are planned to be gradually cleaned up and abolished. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Depression of Jiujiang's Market <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>No Goods to Transport by Land or Water</p>
<p>A Glimmer of Hope for the Porcelain Industry</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: Jiangxi is an agricultural region along the Yangtze River. Before 1926, rice, porcelain, tea, summer cloth, paper, bamboo, wood, tungsten, and vegetable oils were exported in large quantities, with values often reaching millions. All were transferred through this port to various ports along the Yangtze River and sold both domestically and internationally. The major wharves and warehouses of Jiujiang were piled high with goods. Transfer stations, customs brokers, pawnshops, and various trade associations stood shoulder to shoulder, even surpassing Nanchang. Now, due to the impact of economic decline, all industries have declared bankruptcy. The Nanxun Railway, Jiangxi River boats, and Yangtze River steamers have almost no goods to transport, with only imports and no exports. Moreover, since the establishment of the Bandit Suppression and Rehabilitation Production and Sales Tax Bureau in Jiujiang the year before last, Jiujiang's already feeble commerce has been burdened with another layer of shackles. Although the production tax has been abolished this year, the elimination of the import surtax remains indefinitely postponed. To avoid this tax, merchants either transship goods through Wuxue to the upper reaches or Anqing to the lower reaches. Except for merchants from the provincial capital and the interior, most merchants from the border areas of the three provinces detour to avoid Jiujiang, causing the market to become even more depressed. However, in the past two years, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has resided in Lushan and convened several important meetings, also transferring middle and upper-level military officers from across the country to Lushan for training in stages. As a result, the road to Xunyang and Lushan was crowded with officials and dignitaries, which significantly benefited the hotel and fine porcelain industries in Jiujiang, enabling them to break free from the atmosphere of economic downturn. To further revitalize the porcelain industry, the provincial government has specially established the Guangda Porcelain Company in Xunyang, with Du Chongyuan as the director. The scale is quite grand, and it may contribute to the prosperity of Xunyang in the future. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Strict Prohibition of Unauthorized Reclamation of the State-Operated Jinshui Farm <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Headquarters Cables Hubei Provincial Government</p>
<p>Instructing Local Authorities in Four Counties to Crack Down at Any Time</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Jinshui River basin in Hubei Province spans four counties: Wuchang, Jiayu, Puqi, and Xianning, covering an area of over one million mu. Over the years, it has been subject to backflow from the Yangtze River, turning into a marshland during the spring and summer seasons, leading to disasters. After the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters, in consultation with the National Economic Council, raised substantial funds and built the Jinkou Sluice Dam, the accumulated waterlogged areas have been transformed into fertile land. Furthermore, the headquarters decided to trial-run a state-operated farm and established the "Preparatory Office for the State-Operated Jinshui River Basin Farm." Subsequently, Chen Zhenxian, the director of the Rural Revival Business Preparatory Office, was also assigned to handle this matter. On one hand, the headquarters issued a public announcement to clear public and private property rights and register them to prevent disputes. Before the completion of the clearing, private speculative buying and selling were invalid. The announcement was issued on March 7, and it has been nine months since then. Many residents have reclaimed wasteland by recruiting people without completing registration procedures, and the prohibition has been ineffective. Chen Zhenxian fears that this will hinder the state-operated enterprise and has submitted a request to the Nanchang Headquarters to take measures to crack down on it. After receiving the report, the headquarters cabled the Hubei Provincial Government yesterday, instructing the heads of counties, districts, bao, and jia to strictly prohibit it at any time, and also issued the following announcement: "According to the report submitted by Chen Zhenxian, the director of the Rural Revival Business Preparatory Office, this office previously received an order from your Excellency to take over the affairs of the Preparatory Office for the State-Operated Jinshui River Basin Farm. Following this order, personnel were dispatched to take over. It has been found that many people within the Jinshui River Basin area have not come to this office to apply for registration, and their property rights have not yet been determined. They have taken the dried-up lake wasteland and recruited people to reclaim it without authorization. The Preparatory Office for the State-Operated Jinshui River Basin Farm has already issued a public announcement prohibiting this. According to the report, more people have recently privately recruited people to reclaim land than before. If strict measures are not taken to prohibit it, it will greatly hinder the construction of the state-operated farm. It is proposed to issue a public announcement to prohibit it, ordering the Hubei Provincial Government to instruct the county magistrates of Wuchang, Jiayu, Puqi, and Xianning to instruct the heads of bao and jia in various districts of the Jinshui River Basin to effectively stop it at any time to facilitate progress, etc. After investigation, the households within the Jinshui River Basin area whose property rights to the dried-up lake wasteland have not yet been determined should be strictly prohibited from reclamation to prevent disputes and facilitate clearing. In addition to instructing the Hubei Provincial Government to instruct the county magistrates of Wuchang, Jiayu, Puqi, and Xianning to instruct the heads of bao and jia in various districts of the Jinshui River Basin to effectively stop it at any time, this announcement is hereby issued to all business households and others to comply with and not violate it."

After inspecting Huangqiao Town, they continued to Sanjiaodu Sancheyang. Suddenly, a stone boat sailed from the east, driven by the wind. The crew of the patrol boat, seeing the dangerous approach, fearing a collision, urgently stopped the ship. The stone boat paid no attention, resulting in the two bows colliding. The patrol boat could not withstand the impact and tilted. Li Tingfu, an inspector on the patrol boat, was injured on the spot. All the passengers on board rushed to escape. The crew of the stone boat, fearing that the rescue of the patrol boat would be detrimental to them, continued sailing and avoided providing assistance. Fortunately, He Shimin, a crew member on the patrol boat, used a gun to stop them, and the seven members of the patrol boat were rescued onto the stone boat. They arrived at Chuanlai Temple Town, but the patrol boat had lost a box gun and other miscellaneous items, with losses exceeding 400 yuan.</p>

The area through which the road passes is densely populated with towns and cities, and the passenger traffic is extremely crowded. Over twenty long and short-distance bus trips are needed to accommodate the demand. The journey from the provincial capital to Jiangyin can be completed in just three to five hours. The Highway Administration also plans to set up a river ferry in Jiangyin, so that the counties downstream can use this shortcut to reach the ports of Nanjing and Shanghai. The journey will take no more than ten hours. The roads in southern Jiangsu are being completed one after another. Only the road surfaces of the Xihu (Wuxi to Shanghai) and Liwu (Lishui to Wujin) roads have not yet been constructed and are being actively planned.

<h3 id="e119">Course of Consultations <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty was first discussed with the French Ambassador Weilitun when Wang Zhengting was the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but was then suspended for various reasons. Therefore, the reporter then went to visit Mr. Wang, but failed to meet him because he was out. The reporter then visited a certain unofficial person who held an important position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time to inquire about the course of consultations at that time. According to the reply, the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty was revised in 1920 by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting, and approved by our side. However, the French side has not yet approved it, so it cannot be implemented. Currently, the import of our goods is subject to ordinary import taxes, making it difficult to sell Chinese silk, tea, firecrackers, ceramics, hardware, groceries, and everything else. Therefore, overseas Chinese groups in Vietnam, the Yunnan Chamber of Commerce, and others have successively telegraphed the government, requesting the revision of the new treaty as soon as possible. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then submitted the matter to the French side for further negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Crux of the Problem <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>However, this issue is extremely complex, and the important crux is the Sino-Vietnamese border and tariff issues. Because the Sino-Vietnamese territorial sea and high seas fishing zones have not been demarcated for a long time, our fishing boats are often subject to harsh penalties. In early 1923, the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to the repeated requests of overseas Chinese merchants in Annam for negotiations, repeatedly negotiated with the French Ambassador Weilitun, but ultimately the two sides disagreed on the issue of reciprocal goods in the new treaty, and the dispute has not been resolved. As for tariffs, the French side also requested a reduction in the increased tax on imported foreign rice, which our country refused to agree to. Therefore, these two issues are the major crux of the prolonged failure to revise the treaty.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Resumption of Negotiations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>When the French Ambassador Weilitun returned to his home country, he asked his government for instructions. On his return to China, he brought with him the instructions of the French government, so on the 13th of this month, he entered Beijing from Pingjin and reopened negotiations with the authorities of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue consultations. Currently, the views of both sides are gradually converging, and it is expected that the commercial treaty will be signed soon after the beginning of the year.</p>

However, yesterday, various shipping companies received a telegram from the port stating that Datong is stable, its defenses are very secure, and Yangtze River ships can pass through as usual, with no obstacles to cargo transportation and passenger travel. Therefore, starting today, the Yangtze River ships will resume transporting cargo and passengers to Datong.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Qianye Trade Leader Qin Runqing Negotiates with Banking Syndicate Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>One Million in Silver to be Released</p>
<p>*Shen Shi News Agency* Local News: Since the implementation of the U.S. silver purchase policy, silver has been flowing out of our country continuously. From January to November of this year, silver exports exceeded imports by over 250 million yuan. As of last week, the silver reserves of Chinese and foreign banks were only 300 million yuan (280 million yuan, 28.9 million taels), resulting in a widespread shortage of silver, which has further hindered the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, Qin Runqing, a leader in the Qianye trade, has carefully considered and planned a solution to the current stalemate. He specifically consulted with Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank; Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China; and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, to release 10 million yuan in silver to various Qian Zhuang (native banks), which would then provide loans to industrial and commercial circles with collateral. An increase in silver in the market would naturally stabilize confidence, and those who hoard silver due to rumors would release it. Silver circulation in the market would inevitably become more active, and the reserves of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications would also be replenished through the release. This matter has been discussed and planned by Qin Runqing, Zhang Gongquan, and others at the Central Bank in several meetings, and last night, another meeting was held at Tang Shoumin's residence at the Bank of Communications. The results were very satisfactory. The reporter of *Shen Shi News Agency* has learned that the results of the meeting can be generally summarized as follows: (1) The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will each release 4 million yuan, and the Central Bank will release 2 million yuan, for a total of 10 million yuan. (2) The interest rate for the release will be temporarily set at 7%. (3) Qian Zhuang in need of cash can separately contact the three banks to negotiate the release. If the need is greater, it may exceed 10 million yuan. However, according to observations in the financial sector, although the silver situation seems urgent, due to the decline in industry and commerce, the demand is not very high, and the 10 million yuan may not be fully utilized.</p>
<h3 id="e126">North China Private Goods Imported Tax Evasion Causes Significant Losses to Customs <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Artificial Silk and White Sugar are Major Items</p>
<p>Stricter Patrols Have Slightly Reduced This Year</p>
<p>Along the coast of North China, there is a prevalent "junk trade," where large sand boats are used to secretly import tax-evading private goods. Those engaged in this trade are mostly unscrupulous merchants who collude with merchants from a certain country, with Dalian as the center. Each year, private goods worth several tens of millions of yuan are secretly transported from Dalian to various commercial ports in North China. The huge losses to our country's customs revenue can be imagined. According to a survey by a commercial organization operating in North China, since January of this year, in order to strictly prohibit smuggling, our country's customs has specifically dispatched customs cruisers to Tianjin, Zhifu, Weihaiwei, and Qingdao to strengthen patrols. As a result, up to now, a total of more than 180 sand boats carrying smuggled inferior goods have been intercepted, with a value of approximately 1.4 million yuan. Although secret imports have decreased compared to previous years, the total for this year is still around 13 million yuan. The smuggled goods are mainly artificial silk, accounting for the largest share. Apart from white sugar, amounting to 2.67 million yuan, the remaining 10 million yuan is mostly artificial silk. However, if North China Customs can continue to enforce strict patrols, the trend of smuggling will likely be greatly reduced in the future.</p>

<p>Silver Situation Expected to Ease After the New Year</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: According to news from banking circles in Shanghai yesterday morning, although the silver situation in the city has been tight recently, it is predicted that there will be no major events in the silver and money trade during the period leading up to the Western New Year. After the New Year, the silver situation in Shanghai is expected to ease. Banking officials widely dismiss rumors that the Ministry of Finance will reduce the silver content of silver coins as unfounded.</p>

<p>Since the Urgent Relief General Donation Committee discussed with leaders from various circles and decided to solicit donations based on the wealth distribution of the affluent, the wealthy have been actively submitting general donations to the Committee in recent days. Yesterday, it was reported that Mr. Yan Weilian donated 10,000 yuan, and Mr. Wang Boyuan donated 500 yuan. Mr. Zhu Yinjiang and Mr. Zhao Zhuochen have already donated several hundred yuan, and have sent representatives to the Committee to count the money. This shows that the wealthy are enthusiastically donating to the urgent relief efforts. It was also reported that letters sent by the Urgent Relief General Donation Committee to the wealthy, including Shen Xingshu, Chen Chunan, Huang Jingquan, Pan Chengbo, and Yin Shisheng, could not be delivered, or the envelopes indicated that they were out of town, showing a complete lack of concern for the disaster areas, which is a stark contrast to those who are enthusiastically and generously providing assistance. The Urgent Relief General Donation Committee has decided on a course of action to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Schools submitted donations and receipt stubs to the Urgent Relief General Donation Committee yesterday, including Xiaofan Elementary School with 2 yuan in silver dollars, 20 jiao in silver small change, and 322 copper coins; Zhongshan Elementary School with 8 yuan in silver dollars and 146 jiao in silver small change; Jinye Elementary School with 5 yuan in silver dollars; Zhengxiu Second Elementary School with 35 yuan and 9 jiao in silver dollars, 34 jiao in silver small change, and 461 copper coins; Ningbo Seventh Elementary School with 3 yuan in silver dollars and 144 jiao in silver small change; Ren'ai Elementary School with 16 yuan in silver dollars and 10 jiao in silver small change; Sanyu Junior High School with 14 yuan in silver dollars and 446 jiao in silver small change; Datong University with over 150 yuan in silver dollars, over 600 jiao in silver small change, and 94 copper coins; China Science Company with 69 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen in silver dollars; and Lu Wei Reading donated 10 yuan and 5 jiao and 7 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Participation in the Philippine Carnival Postponed Temporarily for One Year <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Fundraising Halted, Preparatory Committee Issues Statement</p>
<p>The participation of Chinese national products in the Philippine Carnival was postponed yesterday (26th) when the seventh preparatory committee meeting was convened temporarily due to difficulties reported via telegram from the Philippines. Committee members, including Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Yexian, Qian Chengxu, Wang Hanqiang, Wang Jiean, Ye Hongcheng, Wu Zhihao, and Chen Yiting, elected Guo Shun as chairman. Regarding the Philippine conference, it was decided to postpone it for one year according to the Mayor's wishes. Regarding the fundraising portion, an urgent notice has been issued to all fundraising committee members to stop fundraising. Preparatory Committee Chairman and Vice-Chairman Guo Shun and Hu Xiyuan issued a statement saying that the preparatory committee, initiated and organized by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, has been in operation for one month. Six committee meetings have been held during the preparation process, passing the organizational charter and product rules, and various participation procedures. The preparation is basically complete. As for the manufacturers, two fundraising conferences have been held, with more than 50 manufacturers participating. As for the financial aspect, the 10,000 yuan subsidy from the municipal government and the 10,000 yuan from the Executive Yuan have also been approved and can be claimed at any time. Such progress in a short period of time is due to the fact that personnel, credit, economic, and all other aspects are proceeding under favorable conditions, so the driving force is great. At the same time, everyone has worked diligently to promote it. On the 25th of this month, we received instructions from the Mayor, who said that he had received a telegram from Luzon, stating that the meeting had decided to cancel the display of goods exhibition because the cost to the factories and shipping companies was too great, and the local preparations could not be completed in time. The committee was asked for its opinion. The committee believes that it was ordered to prepare at that time, and from the committee's perspective, it is willing to set its steps under the Mayor's guidance. After deliberation, it was proposed that the preparatory committee should continue as before, and all the products that have already been solicited will be moved to February 1, 1936, for participation in the display, so that the time can be sufficient and the quantity of products collected can be increased. Postponement is the best option. However, whether this is the case, a committee meeting was convened to determine its policy. After the meeting, the reporter of this newspaper asked Qian Chengxu, Secretary-General of the committee, about the reason for the suspension. He replied that it is well known that Chinese national products have been subject to exclusion everywhere overseas in recent years. The preparatory procedures for this Philippine Carnival have been 60% completed, and yet for this reason, we cannot participate as scheduled, which causes endless thoughts. Regarding this section, I very much hope that our national government can take the protection of industry as a prerequisite everywhere, and that Chinese manufacturers can do their best to reorganize their factories, so that after more than a year, national strength will be sufficient, and the environment will naturally change. In short, the problem with this suspension is not in China, but in the Philippines.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Joint Transportation Contract and Water Transportation Fees between China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Beining Railway <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the joint land and water transportation matters handled by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Beining Railway, Director Zhou Fengtu of the company's Joint Transportation Group had already discussed the details with the authorities of the Beining Railway during his visit to Tianjin. The details were then submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company proposed Tianjin as the joint transportation station, which would allow the abundant products from provinces such as Hebei and Suiyuan to be transported to Shanghai, Guangdong, and other ports by the most convenient route. However, the Ministry of Railways, considering the freight business of the Jinpu Railway, proposed Bengbu as the joint transportation station, so that all goods would be transferred through the Jinpu Railway to avoid affecting its freight business. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways is still considering this matter and has not yet approved it. However, the joint transportation contract and freight rates have already been agreed upon. Once the Ministry of Railways approves, it can be implemented. It is said that one of the two ports, Tianjin and Bengbu, will be selected as the joint transportation station.</p>

<p>Zhang Zufa, Zhang Zhiguo, Zhang Shufa, Zhang Wenzi, Zhang Chunjiang, Zhang Jinyuan, Zhang Chunfu, and Zhang Wangshi, all from Zhenjiang, went to Japan to work in a barbershop. A Chinese businessman in Japan guaranteed them, but the Japanese maritime police did not allow them to disembark. They were detained in Nagasaki and taken to the maritime police station for detention. Because each person had paid a deposit before going to Japan, it was used to cover their travel expenses. They were forced to board the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru and deported back to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e142">China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Purchases Streamlined, Silent Aircraft for the Shanghai-Beiping Route <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Able to sing and broadcast at will inside the aircraft during flight</p>
<p>To be transported to Shanghai next month to improve the Shanghai-Beiping air route</p>
<p>To improve the Shanghai-Beiping air route, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) recently ordered a new-style, large Douglas aircraft from the United States. The aircraft is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month for installation and application. According to reporters from Shen Shi News Agency who inquired at CNAC, the aircraft will be the only civilian aircraft in China with complete facilities. The design is the latest "streamlined" type, identical to the aircraft that won second prize in the England-Australia long-distance flight competition. Its external structure is similar to the "Boeing" aircraft recently purchased by Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang. The aircraft can accommodate 14 passengers and is equipped with two engines and extremely modern facilities, including the "silent interior" feature. Because ordinary aircraft emit a high level of noise from the engine and the rotating propeller during flight, which is uncomfortable for passengers, the aircraft is equipped with a noise-canceling device. Passengers inside the cabin will not be disturbed by external noise during flight. Even during takeoff and landing, passengers will hardly notice it. Therefore, passengers can talk, sing, and even connect wireless and phonograph equipment inside the aircraft to entertain themselves during the lonely journey. Furthermore, the speed of the aircraft will be higher than that of ordinary civilian aircraft, with a normal speed of approximately 190 miles per hour. When ascending to an altitude of 80 feet or higher, the speed can increase to over 210 miles per hour. Therefore, after the aircraft is transported to Shanghai next year and added to the Beiping-Shanghai route, the flight time will be shortened.</p>

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations issued a circular to all departments stating that by the end of this year, all departments of the Bureau and the North Shanghai and South Shanghai stations must achieve complete order and cleanliness. Regarding official duties, no official matters should be delayed, and files must be cleared. Regarding the office location, whether indoors or outdoors, down to every table and chair, everything must be thoroughly cleaned. Regarding individuals, clothing and appearance should also be noted. The Bureau will send personnel to inspect each of the above items separately by the end of this month to check the results. Therefore, all departments should be notified and instruct their subordinates to comply. This is the order.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Truth about the Case Against Datong Correspondence School <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Files Counterclaim</p>
<p>Requests Investigation of Background</p>
<p>Lu Yaoming, the principal of the Datong Trust Bank Correspondence School on Museum Road, was previously sued by Wang Xingsheng and Wang Xingnan, who claimed to be correspondence students of the school, for fraud in the First Special Court. The case was once heard by the Special Court, which instructed that evidence be investigated before further verification. The matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the case was continued in the Ninth Criminal Court by Judge Xiang Yinghua.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Daylight Robbery at Hengyuanxiang Store: Bullets Fly, Passersby Flee in Terror <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Cash Box Empty, Robbers Disappointed</p>
<p>Two Robbers Shot, Captured One After Another</p>
<p>The Hengyuanxiang Fabric Store, located at No. 20 Dongtingshan Alley, Doushi Street, outside the South City's Dadongmen, is owned by local Mu Shaoqin. However, the store has recently been struggling with poor business and financial difficulties and is in the process of liquidation. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 AM yesterday, five robbers, dressed in various styles, entered the store under the pretext of searching for morphine. They pulled out guns and ordered everyone to be silent. They first drove everyone in the store into a corner and then opened the cash box, intending to loot it. However, the box was empty, and they were greatly disappointed. At that time, a female neighbor of the store discovered what was happening and opened the window to shout for help. In an instant, police sirens were heard everywhere. Hearing the sound, the five robbers realized that their plan had failed and gave a prearranged signal. They rushed out the door to escape. Soon after, four of the robbers fled to Yuelai Street, where they were heard by police officer Cheng Hong from the Langjia Bridge police post. He blew his whistle and gave chase. At this time, two of the robbers each took out a pistol and returned fire at Cheng, who pulled out his own gun and returned fire. At the same time, Wang Yulong from the 20th Post security watch and patrol police chief Dong Huatang arrived after hearing the alarm to assist in the arrest. Gunfire erupted on Yuelai Street, bullets flew, and passersby fled in terror, causing great disorder. As a result, more than 30 shots were fired by both sides. One of the robbers, named Wang Licheng, was shot in the right foot by the police and fell to the ground in pain at the entrance of Wujia Alley, where he was apprehended. A six-inch Browning pistol and one bullet were seized from him. He was then taken to the 16th Precinct Police Station. Later, Wang Songling, a security watchman from the 21st Post, received a report from a passerby that another robber, named Wang Youcai, had been found at the Xianzhua Street entrance in the Damatou area. His left foot had been shot and the bullet had not yet exited, and fresh blood was flowing. He was immediately taken to the precinct police station for investigation. The remaining three robbers who escaped are currently being pursued by the police.</p>
<p>During the interrogation, neither of the plaintiffs nor their attorneys appeared. Only the defendant, Lu Yaoming, appeared with his attorney, Yuan Yang'an. Attorney Yuan stated that the defendant was filing a counterclaim against the two plaintiffs, Wang Xingsheng and Wang Xingnan, for false accusation. After investigation, it was found that the plaintiffs were not students of Datong School. When investigating the letter sent to Zhangjia Alley, Baoce West Gate, no such person was found. The second letter, sent from No. 407 Baoshan Road, Shanghai, damaged the reputation of Datong. After the defendant reported this to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, it was found that Wang Xingnan was working at the Chengxin Bank Correspondence School in the Zhonghui Building. After reporting to the French Concession Police, Wang Xingnan was arrested. Hu Zijun and Hu Wenbin, witnesses living with Wang Xingsheng, testified that Wang Xingsheng was instructed by Xi Yuehan, the principal of Chengxin School, to expand the organization and damage the reputation of Datong. They were then sent to the Second Special Court of Shanghai. The Baoshan County Government case files were investigated, and Wang Xingnan was ordered to post bail. Wang Xingsheng and others had also filed a complaint against the defendant in the Shanghai Education Bureau with the same facts. The Bureau also investigated and determined that they were not students of Datong School and were instigated by others to make false accusations. Therefore, the court was requested to write to the Education Bureau to investigate the circumstances and background of the case so that the truth could be revealed. Since the plaintiffs were not Datong students, they first made false accusations to the Education Bureau, and they should not be allowed to escape justice. Now they are making false accusations to this court, and they have not appeared today. A warrant should be issued for their arrest to clarify the truth. The judge adjourned the case to 2:00 PM on January 8, 1935, to summon the plaintiffs for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Hazy Morning in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been mild for the past week, with temperatures consistently between 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. There has also been heavy fog every day, which does not dissipate even during the day. Yesterday was particularly bad. It was impossible to distinguish between men and women ten zhang away. Around 8:45 AM, it suddenly became extremely dark, lasting for about 15 minutes. It was impossible to see indoors without turning on electric lights. The whole day was drizzly and extremely humid, making it unbearably oppressive, like the plum rain season. According to general expectations, the period of great cold is not far away, and it may snow.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Trial of Longhua Temple Case Postponed Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Because Yuanzhao is still in Suzhou and has not been returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Lu Mingzhao and others, the abbot of Longhua Temple, filed a criminal complaint in the local court against the former abbot, Yuanzhao, for encroaching on temple property, as well as an incidental civil suit (approximately 50,000 yuan) to recover seven volumes of "Beiye Sutras" and an ancient bronze Buddha statue, namely the "Prince Buddha," which are extremely valuable and rare in the world. The above two items were claimed to be worth 100,000 yuan. All details were recorded in the "Eternal Record Book." The presiding judge, Shao Qinzhi, scheduled a continued hearing for yesterday afternoon. However, because Yuanzhao was involved in another case—a suit by Xingkong against Yuanzhao regarding the invalidity of the contract signed with Hu Suji—the first instance was decided against Yuanzhao. Yuanzhao appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which ordered Yuanzhao to be escorted to Suzhou for trial. Therefore, when Judge Shao of the local court convened the hearing yesterday, only Pan Zhensheng, the private attorney hired by Xingkong, appeared to prosecute. Yuanzhao's civil appeal case was debated and finalized in the Suzhou High Court on the 24th of this month and is scheduled for sentencing on the 28th. He was ordered to be returned to custody at the time. The judge said: He has not yet been returned and cannot proceed. The hearing will be rescheduled.</p>

<p>51 Men and Women Arrested</p>
<p>Shen Zhenhua, the Chief of the Laobeimen Police Station, recently received a secret report that a large-scale opium den and gambling house had been organized at No. 6 Ren'an Lane in Nine Acres Land. The facilities were comprehensive, and the layout was meticulous. General opium addicts and gamblers flocked to it, so the illicit business was very developed. In particular, there were eight or nine modern women as "flower vase" embellishments, making it a secret den of pleasure. After receiving the report, Chief Shen specially dispatched Inspector Qi Bin, Zhang Lantian, Sergeant Gao Kui, and the entire patrol team, along with thirteen watchmen led by Wang Yaozong, at 10 PM the night before. They arrested Zhu Guoyan (36 years old, Jiading), Wang Yucheng (53 years old, Suzhou), Wang Jinzhi (29 years old, Ningbo), Hu Shunsui (27 years old, Pudong), Xu Jingfu (37 years old, Zhenjiang), Zhang Rongjin (27 years old, Suzhou), Su Guolong (36 years old, Tongzhou), Guo Shitong (54 years old, Guangdong), Lu Adi (35 years old, Suzhou), Li Zhifa (55 years old, Jiading), Wang Zhicheng (60 years old, Shanghai), Wang Jian (44 years old, Shaoxing), Xu Ying (37 years old, Suzhou), Shen Zhang (31 years old, Pudong), Jiang Zhonghai (40 years old, Local), Wang Xinmei (50 years old, Pinghu), Huang Guoliang (24 years old, Local), Li Zhiming (26 years old, Local), Sun Shuxuan (30 years old, Qingpu), Li Zhong (41 years old, Shanghai), Jiang Mingfu (25 years old, Pudong), Jiang Shida (42 years old, Songjiang), Yang Youcai (31 years old, Pudong), Zhou Kaisheng (23 years old, Suzhou), Su Zhihua (42 years old, Local), Zhang Yushan (62 years old, Hubei), Chuan Tiegen (30 years old, Local), Cao Wenhua (28 years old, Wuxi), Shen Jinqiu (32 years old, Jiangsu), Su Shouyu (34 years old, Jiading), Wang Jinyuan (43 years old, Suzhou), Zhou Hongyao (28 years old, Pudong), Yang Hongsheng (63 years old, Ningbo), and 42 others. In addition, there were nine women: Zhang Wengshi (47 years old, Suzhou), Wu Xushi (31 years old, Suzhou), Chen Yangshi (21 years old, Zhenjiang), Li Jiabao (20 years old, Jiading), Wang Ying (17 years old, Local), Li Ajin (26 years old, Suzhou), Li Yuebao (18 years old, Ningbo), Lu Zhangshi (24 years old, Pinghu). A total of 51 people were arrested, along with five opium pipes, eight lamps, six mahjong sets, and other miscellaneous evidence. All were taken to the police station. After interrogation by Chief Shen, they were sentenced and sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Lu Gengquan vs. Tan Yuan Case: Continued Hearing <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Originating from a Water Fee Issue</p>
<p>The Judge Advises Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>Lu Gengquan, the owner of Lu Gengji Construction Company, previously sued Tan Yuan, a Cantonese architect of Hengyao Real Estate Company on Suzhou Road, for damaging his reputation. He hired lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Jiang Chiping to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court. Judge Zhan had summoned Tan once, but Tan did not appear, so a new date was set for another hearing. All details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the case reached the stage of continued hearing. The defendant, Tan Yuan, also arrived with his lawyer, Zhang Yuanmei. The plaintiff, Lu Gengquan, stated that the defendant fabricated rumors and, using his name, reported to the owner, Yu Jinjing, that the Jiangwan Zhengde Road buildings constructed by him required several hundred yuan for water connection fees from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. This caused the owner to report to the Public Works Bureau, which sent a letter requesting an interview, considering that if it were true, his business license would be revoked. However, he actually never said such a thing; it was all fabricated by the defendant. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit to seek a legal resolution to restore his reputation. When questioned, the defendant Tan Yuan stated that he initially received Lu's report about the water connection fees, so he notified the owner. If there were fees, the owner and Lu would split them. Later, Lu wired back stating there were no fees, and he also reported this to the owner. Then, the owner Yu Jinyu testified that his Jiangwan Zhengde Road property was purchased from the Shanghai Bank. At that time, the bank had stated that if buildings were constructed, except for telephone and electric lights, all other expenses would be waived. Therefore, he advertised for bids and contracted with Lu Gengji Construction Company to start construction. Only because the area lacked tap water pipes, there was no tap water available, so they used river water for construction. He disliked the river water being unclean, so he ordered a temporary halt to construction, pending a request to the Water and Electricity Plant to install water pipes before resuming work. Therefore, he immediately consulted with both the plaintiff and defendant to discuss the water connection issue. At the time, Lu did not know if there would be special fees for water connection, so it was decided to discuss it further after inquiring. A few days later, he received a call from Tan Yuan, stating that he had received a report from Lu that 550 yuan was required for water connection fees, and he should split the cost with Lu. Upon hearing this, he immediately notified the Shanghai Bank and reported it to the Public Works Bureau for investigation. Unexpectedly, two days later, he received another call from Tan reporting that Lu had clarified that no fees were required for water connection, and he also stated this to the Shanghai Bank. At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Yuanmei, stood up and stated that the owner had intervened, stating that both parties were close friends and did not want to be involved in litigation for so long. It would be better to proceed with reconciliation, and the defendant was very willing to accept, but he did not know what the plaintiff's intentions were. Judge Zhan Liangce also stated that both the plaintiff and defendant were legitimate businessmen, and this matter only required clarifying the misunderstanding with the Public Works Bureau. If understanding was reached, the case could be dismissed. Therefore, he advised each to make concessions and discuss a reconciliation plan. The plaintiff's lawyers Wu and Jiang also indicated their agreement, stating that although this case was minor, it had major implications. Jiangwan Central District was currently planning to revive the market, and the municipal government had repeatedly announced that no illegal profiteering or extra demands were allowed. The sudden occurrence of this matter greatly impacted the future of the revival. Therefore, the Director of the Public Works Bureau must thoroughly investigate to clarify the truth. Now that the court had advised reconciliation, their client was very willing to accept, but the defendant must accompany the plaintiff and both lawyers to the Public Works Bureau to explain the misunderstanding and jointly publish a statement to restore their client's reputation. The court ordered the case to be adjourned to January 8th, 24th year [of the Republic], in the afternoon for further hearing, instructing both parties to attempt reconciliation.</p>

<p>Fiancée Claims Engagement Gifts Were Insufficient</p>
<p>And Wedding Date Was Missed, No One Came to Fetch Her</p>
<p>Yan Lianzhen, a female employee of the Maochang Air Conditioning Factory in Nanshi, was engaged to Shen Ada, also known as Shen Jichun, who resides at Wansheng Sesame Oil Shop on Seymour Road, in the 20th year of the Republic through the matchmaking of her brother-in-law Jin Youzhang and her sister Jin Yanshi. They have not yet married. Now Shen Ada has suddenly filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court, accusing Yan Lianzhen and Jin Youzhang and his wife of fraud. His reason is that he sent an engagement gift of 500 yuan when they were engaged and chose to marry in the 21st year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, after accepting the engagement, she made all kinds of demands, and when the wedding date arrived, the bride suddenly disappeared without a trace, causing the plaintiff to suffer losses. When negotiating with Jin and his wife, they said the bride could not be found as a way to evade responsibility, so it has been delayed until now. This situation is actually fraud, and he requests that the court punish them according to Article 363 of the Criminal Law and seeks compensation of 500 yuan for the engagement gift in an attached civil lawsuit. Yan Lianzhen's defense claims that when the engagement was set, it was stated that the engagement gift would be 400 yuan, four gold items, and four sets of clothing. They also agreed to complete the marriage in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic. However, the plaintiff only sent 200 yuan in engagement money and three gold items at the time and did not follow the original agreement. After repeated negotiations, they always made evasive promises. Moreover, the agreed-upon wedding date was missed, and no one came to fetch her, treating the marriage contract like a joke. Her reputation has been damaged, and the fault lies not with the defendant but with the plaintiff. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for a hearing. Yan Lianzhen hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an for her defense. Judge Huang adjourned the case and instructed both parties to reconcile outside of court.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Xue Mailuo Law Firm Robbery Case: French Police File Appeal to the Third Instance <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Reversal of the Original Verdict and Remanding the Case for Retrial</p>
<p>On June 9th of this year, at around 4:00 PM, the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Edward Road in the French Concession was robbed of 12,000 yuan in cash. The suspects in the case, Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, were arrested by the French police and sent to the Second Special Court for trial. After being declared innocent, the Police Department, dissatisfied, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the trial concluded, the appeal was rejected. All details and the judgments of the two trials have been reported in previous newspapers. However, the French Police Department was still unable to accept the third trial verdict and had submitted reasons, filing a third-instance appeal with the Supreme Court through the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The third-instance appeal statement of the French Police Department has been obtained and is transcribed below: "Regarding the matter of supplementing the reasons for the appeal, in the Zhang Zuming robbery case, the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court delivered a verdict of innocence, and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court rejected the appellant's appeal. The appellant then declared a third-instance appeal. All have been filed. The reasons for the appeal are hereby supplemented. The plaintiff in this case, Zhou Jinggeng, on June 9th of this year, at around 4:00 PM, dispatched Gao Yushu, Feng Tiyue, and Wan Guirong to the China Industrial Bank to exchange banknotes. Ten minutes after returning to the Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm at No. 9 Edward Road, they were robbed by four robbers armed with guns, who stole 12,000 yuan in banknotes. The fact that the robbery occurred has been thoroughly investigated and confirmed by the original trial. The only question to be studied is whether the appellees were the four robbers. During the robbery, the witnesses who saw the situation were Gao Yushu, Feng Tiyue, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, Mike Luo, and Wang Guixiang. At that time, none of the four robbers were captured. On June 17th, Zhang Zuming was first seen by Gao Yushu, who reported him to the police, who made the arrest. Although Feng Tiyue failed to identify him once at the Hongkou Police Station in the Public Concession, when Zhuang Jimeng and Wang Lianyou were subsequently arrested, Gao Yushu, Feng Tiyue, Wan Guirong, Qian Genghua, and Mike Luo were all able to point them out from the crowd. Finally, Tang Qingyue was apprehended, and all witnesses identified him in the first trial as one of the robbers. They all stated that Zhang Zuming and Wang Lianyou entered the office and ordered them not to move and not to look. They also searched Gao Yushu and Feng Tiyue and found banknotes. Zhuang Jimeng stood at the door on the second floor, and Tang Qingyue guarded the outer door. All four were carrying guns. The testimonies were consistent and without discrepancies. Wang Guixiang also identified Wang Lianyou in the second trial as the one who dragged him into the office, and Zhang Zuming held a gun to the manager, etc. Although his statement differed slightly from the previous five, he did identify Zhang Zuming and Wang Lianyou as the ones who committed the robbery by force and coercion. All the above witnesses had no feud with the appellees and had no reason to falsely accuse them. Zhang Zuming's confession at the Police Department was written by his own hand. His denials of the robbery in the second and third trials were clearly attempts to shirk responsibility. The Police Department did not threaten him before, during, or after he wrote his confession, nor did it interfere with his freedom. Zhang Zuming also showed no signs of injury. The original trial's statement that whether the confession was made of his own free will was not entirely beyond doubt seems somewhat arbitrary. Moreover, Zhang Zuming also confessed without reservation in the First Special District Court, where the trial was public, and there could not have been any possibility of coercion. As for the detective's instruction not to retract the confession, it was merely a fabrication by the appellee Zhang Zuming and is not credible. Since Zhang Zuming's confession was not obtained through improper means, it is only necessary to investigate whether it is consistent with the facts. The date, time, number of people, location, building, direction of the door, purpose of stealing money, and weapons used in his confession are all consistent with the eyewitness accounts of Gao Yushu and others. As for whether there was prior contact, it was not something the witnesses could have known. The original trial's finding that it was inconsistent with the facts is inappropriate. There is no doubt that Zhang Zuming was the perpetrator of the case. After Zhang Zuming confessed to Zhuang Jimeng, Wang Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, Zhuang and Wang were first apprehended and sent to the French Concession Police Department, where they were identified by Feng Tiyue, Mike Luo, and others from the crowd. The original trial stated that after Zhuang Jimeng and Wang Lianyou were apprehended, Gao Yushu and the plaintiff Zhou Jinggeng's lawyer, Yan Luqing, had peeked into the trial room at the Hongkou Police Station beforehand, as stated in a letter from the Public Concession Police Department. However, whether the contents of the letter from the Public Concession Police Department are credible as evidence is questionable, and their description of their appearance is purely speculative. As for the defendants being suddenly arrested and appearing worried, which is inconsistent with the leisurely attitude of ordinary people, it seems unfounded. Zhuang Jimeng and Wang Lianyou were confessed by Zhang Zuming and identified by witnesses. Wang Lianyou entered to search, Zhuang Jimeng stood at the second door, and both were carrying guns. There is no doubt that they were the ones who committed the robbery. Tang Qingyue was also confessed by Zhang Zuming and identified by Gao Yushu and others after his arrest as the one who guarded the door and was carrying a gun. His crime has also been proven without doubt. Since there is direct and positive evidence of the crimes committed by the appellees, there is no need to study the appellees' rebuttals, and they cannot be used as the basis for the judgment. Therefore, this supplementary reason is filed, requesting the reversal of the original verdict and remanding the case for retrial. A fair judgment would be in the public interest. This appeal is respectfully submitted to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for transmission to the Supreme Court for its consideration."</p>
<p>The Reason: At the time of the engagement, it was clearly stated that the engagement gift would be 400 yuan, four gold items, and four sets of clothing. It was also agreed to complete the marriage in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic. However, the plaintiff only sent 200 yuan in engagement money and three gold items at the time and did not follow the original agreement. After repeated negotiations, he always made evasive promises. Moreover, the agreed-upon wedding date was missed, and no one came to fetch her, treating the marriage contract like a joke. Her reputation has been damaged, and the fault lies not with the defendant but with the plaintiff. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for a hearing. Yan Lianzhen hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an for her defense. Judge Huang adjourned the case and instructed both parties to reconcile outside of court.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of winter defense in this city from December 10th, lasting for three months until the end of February of the 24th year [of the Republic], it is learned that the heads of the two Public Security Bureaus of the New Zhabei Station, Gong Fengkui and Liang Fuchu, in addition to selectively increasing posts every day, also ordered patrolling police officers to accompany plainclothes detectives to inspect suspicious pedestrians in rotation. The security team patrols in shifts during the day and sends sentries to guard all strategic passes at night. The Bao'an Corps also assists the police and security team in making similar preparations at night, so petty thieves have no way to succeed, and theft cases seem to have decreased compared to the winter defense period last year.</p>

<p>The Daily News reported that the Haili Fishing Vessel Bureau, a fishery organization in this city, noted that the trawlers used by Chinese fishermen for fishing were dilapidated and that the newly purchased fishing vessels were all dependent on foreign countries, resulting in a significant outflow of rights and interests. In order to reverse the losses, it started building a fishing vessel in May of this year by Hongxiangxing in Pudong. If it proved successful, it planned to continue manufacturing. It is learned that the fishing vessel has been completed. It is 135 feet long, has 600 horsepower, and the total cost is only 80,000 yuan. The internal equipment is the most modern of any trawler. After the vessel was completed, it was named "Hai Kang" and underwent sea trials outside Wusongkou the day before yesterday. The results were excellent, traveling at 10.5 nautical miles per hour. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Industries for record-keeping and will be used for fishing along the coast. It is planned to continue adding to the fleet in the future.</p>

<p>No Harm to Human Health</p>
<p>Another Type of Pleuropneumonia Discovered</p>
<p>Foot-and-mouth disease has been discovered in livestock in this city. At the same time, the Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Institute has handled the inspection, and the import of foreign livestock has been temporarily suspended. The Datong News Agency reporter learned that since the discovery of the animal disease, the people of this city have been significantly affected. Therefore, the relevant parties were visited to investigate the situation, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Harbor Quarantine Office Attention <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reporter visited Mr. Zhou Zhongqian, the secretary of the Harbor Quarantine Management Office at No. 2 Beijing Road, yesterday morning and learned that since the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock in this city, the office has paid great attention to imported livestock. According to Mr. Zhou, the transmission of foot-and-mouth disease is limited to cattle, pigs, sheep, etc., and there is no possibility of transmission to humans. Our health will not be affected.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Animal Diseases Harmful to Humans <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou continued, saying that the most severe animal epidemic is the plague, which is easily transmitted to humans, and the mortality rate is higher than that of rats. Rats infected with the plague are not necessarily dead, but humans infected with it have little hope of survival. However, the symptoms of the plague do not easily occur. According to the calculations of world veterinary experts, it generally occurs once every fifty years because its germs have a cyclical nature.</p>
<h3 id="e158">No Suitable Treatment Method <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to veterinary expert Sun Zhongqiu, the bacteria of foot-and-mouth disease (FOOT AND MOUTH DISHOSE) are commonly referred to as (GERM). Ten years ago, livestock in this city once had this disease. However, the famous veterinarians in Europe and the United States also feel helpless about the method of treating foot-and-mouth disease. The only method is the passive one, isolating the sick livestock, burning their excrement, washing the affected parts, etc. It is also said that the mortality rate of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock is not high. At most, two or three out of ten sick livestock die.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Case of the Assassination of Tang Jiapeng Reopens Trial Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xinggao Denies Instructing the Murder; The Case Requires Investigation and the Hearing Was Adjourned</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as A Yu, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was shot and killed by a number of thugs instigated by an enemy at around 1:00 AM on June 18th of last year at the entrance of Great World as he was about to get into his car to go home. At the same time, Wu Xiancai, a bathhouse attendant from Yangzhou who was passing by, was killed by stray bullets. After the incident, detectives from the French Police Special Agency arrested the perpetrators Zhang Xiaosizi, also known as Zhang Tinggui, a native of Funing, and Zhao Guangfu, a native of Yangzhou, and confiscated a pistol and several bullets used by Zhao to kill Tang. They were sent to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for premeditated murder. After interrogation and judgment, Zhang was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Life Imprisonment <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Deprivation of civil rights for life. The two criminals, dissatisfied, filed an appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected. However, Zhao was still dissatisfied and has filed a third-instance appeal with the Supreme Court, which has not yet been decided. Zhang's sentence has been finalized and he has been sent to the Second Special District Prison to serve his sentence. Currently, Lang Bole, the Western Inspector of the Second Detective Team of the French Police Department, based on the confession of the arrested criminal Zhao Guangfu, learned that Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing residing at No. 46, Menggu Road, Zhabei (also known as Wang Xiaogao, 39 years old this year), was the mastermind behind the murder of Tang. At midnight on the 13th of this month, he took detectives Wang Rusong and Guo Shaorong, along with the Laozha Police Station, and dispatched detectives to Room 537 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road, arresting Wang and taking him back to the police station. He was sent to the Second Special Court the next day.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Interrogation and Detention for Investigation <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>All details have been reported in previous newspapers. The Police Department has requested and received approval from the court to transfer the two criminals Zhang Tinggui and Zhao Guangfu, who were previously apprehended, from the Second Special District Prison and the Detention Center to the Police Department for detention, confrontation with Wang, and thorough investigation. The investigation has now concluded. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Xiong Huiping and Secretary Tao Zongkan specially opened the Seventh Court for the trial. Wang's family and friends were all in court to listen, causing the courtroom to be overcrowded. Lawyer Gu Shouxi represented the Police Department in court. After the court opened, the judge ordered Wang Xinggao to be brought before the court. After questioning the defendant's age, place of origin, address, and occupation, Wang stated (age, residence, and place of origin omitted) that he is currently the warden of the First Prison in Wuchang, Hubei, and has never committed a crime before. Then the police lawyer stood up and stated</p>
<h3 id="e162">Prosecutorial Intent <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>And the details of the case and the investigation process of the Police Department, and stated that they are now prosecuting him for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law and requested the court to conduct the trial. The court verified the report and questioned Wang Xinggao about the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. Wang stated that he went to Hubei on August 1st of the 21st year of the Republic and was still there in the 22nd year, and had not returned to Shanghai. He himself is a civil servant, so how could he do such a murderous thing? He knows nothing about the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. In the 17th year of the Republic, he was a civil servant and the captain of the inspection team in the 26th Army, and he handled many murder and robbery cases in Zhabei, so he has many enemies. When he returned to Shanghai on July 28th of the lunar calendar last year, he was even rewarded by Chairman Chiang. He was also the head of the intelligence department in the 19th Army. Many bad people outside wanted to</p>
<h3 id="e163">Plot to Harm Me <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>He does not know Zhao Guangfu and asked for him to be brought up for questioning. At this point, the judge ordered the deputy chief detective of the Second Detective Team of the French Police Department in charge of this case to report on the investigation process. Then he ordered Zhao Guangfu to be brought to the court as a key witness. According to Zhao, Wang Xinggao instructed the assassination of Tang Jiapeng and was introduced to him by carpenter Zhou Er. In fact, he has always known Wang, but they do not greet each other often. At the time, carpenter Zhou Er told him that someone wanted revenge and that he would be given 100 yuan after it was done. First, he had tea with Zhou at the tiger stove on Hengfeng Road, and then a few more people came in. Zhou said they were all family members. Later, he did not hear them talking. He had met Wang Xinggao at the Renhe Lou teahouse in Banbei, which was on this day. He, Wang, and Zhou had met at the Da Jiangnan Hotel</p>
<h3 id="e164">Met Once <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>He had not met him after the assassination, and he had not received any money. It was now given to him by Sun Er. He does not know what revenge he was taking. He was confused for a moment and was fooled. If he had known that the law was so strict, he would rather beg for food than do it. The judge then questioned Wang Xinggao based on Zhao's confession. Wang stated that he was in Hubei at that time and there was no such thing. Zhao Guangfu had committed robbery and pawnshop fraud in Zhabei before, and he had handled his case. Zhao immediately said that there was no such thing and asked the court to investigate. He has no grudges with him at all. This time, while he was detained in the police station, he told him to speak with his conscience, and he was willing to support his elderly father. Wang Xinggao also stated that he had never said these words and had only told him that he had something to say about the murder.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Speaking from the Conscience <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Words should not be spoken carelessly. Regarding the case of Zhang Tinggui, whose official fate required a witness, it has now been confirmed that he has been brought to justice. According to his testimony, he does not know Wang or Zhao. He claims to know nothing about the death of Tang Jiapeng. The official also interrogated Liu Guogui, the disguised criminal, who testified that he was in the police station for six days and five nights, and heard Zhao Guangfu discussing with Wang Xinggao. Later, Zhao said he would speak from his conscience and not face a lawsuit. The next day, he heard Wang tell Zhao, "I dare not give you money." Zhao demanded three things from Wang: to bring Zhao's father, who is currently in Yangzhou, for a meeting, to support him as a beggar, and to give him four hundred yuan. During the appeal, he wants a solution. The official questioned Wang based on this. Wang's answers were vague. By this point in the interrogation, it was past noon. The official said that the case still required an official letter to the Hubei authorities for investigation, and therefore adjourned the hearing to 2 PM on January 11th of the 24th year. The defendant and the two criminals Zhao and Zhang were returned to the police station for detention. Wang Xinggao immediately requested to be transferred to the detention center. The court approved this, and a detention order was issued to the detention center, but visits were prohibited. The court then adjourned. Wang was escorted to the detention center by bailiffs, and Zhao and Zhang were sent back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Another Discovery of Pleurisy <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sun then described in detail the symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease (which are the same as those published by the Animal Disease Prevention Institute in yesterday's newspaper, so they are omitted). He also said that in addition to the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among livestock in this port, a small number of cattle also developed a type of pleurisy a month ago. However, pleurisy can be treated, but it has not yet been completely eradicated. He also said that people in society seem to pay little attention to the diseases of livestock. In fact, from the animal's perspective, with universal love as the guiding principle, it should not be ignored, and so on.</p>

<p>The Datong News Agency reporter then inquired by telephone about the Sheng Sheng Ranch and the Freedom Farm, and learned that the dairy cows at both ranches were very peaceful. However, in the Hongkou area, there were a small number of milk sheds where the foot-and-mouth disease had been detected. Therefore, the impact on drinks is still minimal. However, since the health authorities in the Chinese area temporarily banned the import of cattle, the price has risen from fourteen yuan to eighteen yuan (calculated per dan). At the same time, there are not many cattle left in this port, and a beef consumption panic is expected to occur.</p>

<p>Because the appeal period has passed, the defendant is presumably understood.</p>
<p>Liang receives a six-month sentence with a two-year reprieve.</p>
<p>Regarding Liang Tongfang, who was previously warned at the Yuelai Southern Goods Store on Wuma Road and fell into the legal net, after the first trial verdict on November 17th, the Municipal Council declared its dissatisfaction and appealed to the High Court. On December 11th, the original verdict was revoked, and the sentence was changed to six months of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. If dissatisfied, one could file an appeal with the Supreme Court within ten days of the delivery of the judgment. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency noted that the appeal deadline has passed, and yesterday especially visited Liang Tongfang at the Civilian Sanatorium. It was claimed that more than ten days had passed since the second instance verdict, and no news of an appeal from the plaintiff had been heard, presumably they understood the original intention of the warning to Yuelai Southern Goods Store, and therefore would not appeal.</p>

<p>Jingan Damaged Engine. The Jingan steamer of the Sanbei Company is currently sailing in North China. On the 24th of this month, the steamer departed from Tianjin, intending to go to Qingdao to load cargo and then return to Shanghai. When it sailed to a location twelve nautical miles off the coast of the Haihe River, the engine suddenly malfunctioned, rendering it unable to sail. The shipowner telegraphed the Tianjin branch to return to Tianjin. Yesterday, a telegram was received stating that it had been towed back to Tianjin on the 24th. The engine malfunction has now been repaired, and it is scheduled to depart from Tianjin again on the 27th to sail south.</p>
<p>Taishun Pipe Burst. The Taishun steamer of the China Merchants Bureau, on this trip from Shanghai to Tianjin, loaded a large amount of cargo from Shanghai. The steamer first went to Weihai and Yantai, but while en route, a water pipe inside the ship suddenly burst. A considerable amount of cargo in the cabin was damaged by the water leaking from the burst pipe. Fortunately, the burst water pipe was repaired by the shipowner. The damaged cargo will not be known until the ship arrives in Tianjin and is unloaded. The Bureau has informed the Tianjin branch by letter, and the branch will properly handle the matter of the damaged cargo.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Major Pharmaceutical Factories Agree on Cooperation Agreement for Common Injectable Drugs <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>A banquet was held yesterday to report the situation to various pharmacies.</p>
<p>The four pharmaceutical factories in this city, New Asia, Xinyi, Minsheng, and Haipu, are the largest in the domestic pharmaceutical industry. They produce more than a hundred kinds of drugs, which are suitable for the climate and physique of Chinese people, and their sales are quite wide. However, in recent years, the common injectable drugs produced by each factory have often fallen in price due to competition, sometimes even below cost. Therefore, they jointly negotiated and entered into a cooperation agreement to establish a unified price. Yesterday afternoon, a banquet was held at Jinlong Western Restaurant to invite various pharmacies in this city to report on the situation. Representatives from Sino-French, Sino-Western, Five Continents, Huayang, Jihuatang, Central, Xinhua, Taihe, Huamei, Dahua, Wanguo, Tianhua, Zhengwei, Dazhong, Tongfa, Huaying, Jicheng, Baohua, Nanyang, and other pharmacies attended. During the banquet, Xu Guanqun was publicly elected by the four factories to stand up and deliver a speech, reporting on the process of establishing the cooperation agreement, hoping that the major pharmacies would provide support to achieve success. After the speech, Xu Xiaochu of Sino-French was publicly elected by the pharmacies to give a reply, stating that the success of this cooperation among the pharmaceutical factories was deeply commendable. This is not only a question between the new pharmaceutical industry and the new drug manufacturing industry, but also concerns the economy of the entire country. The pharmacy colleagues will naturally follow behind and support the success of the unified price. For a while, the cups clinked, and the banquet ended happily at 3 PM.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Enrollment, Municipal Government Decides to Establish Branch Centers</p>
<p>Since its establishment on June 15th of this year in Longhua, the Shanghai Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center has, in six months, rehabilitated a total of 2,000 citizens, according to statistics. There are still many people who have registered but have not been admitted for rehabilitation. Therefore, the Municipal Government has ordered the Health Bureau to select suitable housing in Zhabei to continue establishing branch drug rehabilitation centers, which will soon be established. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e180">Enthusiastic Enrollment <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center has seen very enthusiastic registration from citizens. Since its opening, more than 2,000 people have been rehabilitated. Later, due to the fixed number of 100 beds, and the fact that the Garrison Headquarters must send drug offenders every month, accounting for eight tenths of the beds, there were not many remaining beds. Citizens who wish to be rehabilitated must register in advance, and only when there are beds available can they be admitted for rehabilitation in order. Therefore, there are currently about 300 people who have registered and are waiting for rehabilitation.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Continuing to Establish Branch Centers <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government, in view of the vast urban area and the considerable number of drug addicts, and the fact that the center's beds are insufficient, has ordered the Health Bureau to continue establishing branch centers in Zhabei. It is learned that the Health Bureau is looking for suitable housing and setting up 150 beds. The funding is currently in the budget, and it is expected to be established around next spring, which will undoubtedly benefit the citizens.</p>

<p>As for the rehabilitation procedures, the center hires specialized doctors to use scientific acupuncture methods. The rehabilitation time for each person is about ten days. However, no substitutes are used, and no fees are charged. Therefore, from the time a person enters the center to the time of rehabilitation, the center needs to bear more than ten yuan per person. Based on the calculation of 300 people being rehabilitated per month, the expenses must total more than 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing Words, She Hides Her Tears and Sells Herself into Misery; Carefully Peeking at Invitation Cards, Eagerly Seeking Refuge.</p>
<p>When Li Shilian introduced the two Germans to Jia Duocai, his initial intention was simply to show off for his friend. He thought to himself that if Jia Duocai were to open a branch of his bank in Xi'an, there would certainly be times when he would need to utilize foreigners. Now that he had introduced them, in the future, if he thought of getting to know foreigners, it would be to my credit, and perhaps there would be times when he could help me. It was good to lay the groundwork now. Later, seeing that the Germans' attitude was not very good, and especially when they spoke about doing business, it was contrary to his original hope. He then felt a little sorry for Jia Duocai. Even though he didn't say anything, he could tell by his expression. So he smiled at him and said, "I didn't think they were doing business. If I had known they were like this, I wouldn't have introduced them." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "You look like you feel a little apologetic. What does it matter? Business may not succeed, but friendship remains. Moreover, the Construction Department is thinking of transferring a sum of money from our bank to buy some fuel oil trucks. Maybe they will buy them from these guys? In that case, we will have to deal with them anyway." When Li Shilian heard this, it was as if a firecracker had gone off behind his heels, and he was greatly surprised. He took Jia Duocai's hand and said, "What? Do you know the Director Gao here?" Jia Duocai said, "We bankers always have to deal with the officialdom. Meeting is friendship, not meeting is being strangers." Li Shilian said, "What do you mean by that?" Jia Duocai said, "I only go to see them when I have business. They are certainly willing to get close to people in the banking industry. Anyway, no one in the banking industry will borrow money from officials, so they can feel safe meeting with us." (100)</p>

<p>— By Zhuo</p>
<p>Six leather shoes stepped on the cement sidewalk, one after another.</p>
<p>Three malnutritioned skinny faces secretly hid smiles.</p>
<p>Walk! Irregular steps moved us three lost souls. The yellow soup was just right, and the courage suddenly swelled so fat that we didn't put anyone in our eyes.</p>
<p>We, a group of three skinny guys, walked shoulder-to-shoulder on the sidewalk, singing "la la la" in our mouths. The women saw us and moved away from a distance. We laughed, and our hearts bloomed!</p>
<p>The neon lights shone high, and the five large characters of Sincere Co. and Qianli Xiang flowed with green and red light, illuminating people's faces red and green in the distance, changing color.</p>
<p>The snow scene in the large showcase made people feel strangely cold. The red-clothed old man smiled, and the wrinkles on his face were even deeper. But the white beard without a head or chin wouldn't make up its mind to shave once; it was like this last year, and it's still like this this year, fortunately the beard hasn't grown longer. Suddenly, I remembered that it was the old man's birthday today. Looking at his smiling vigor, carrying so many candies and pulling that little car, the old man really has his own interest.</p>
<p>On the other side, in a corner of the showcase, there were many gold-covered, silver-painted, embossed, and colorful New Year's cards. We remembered a couple who made a living in the education field in Changsha. Every year before Christmas, they sent a letter to congratulate the New Year, no, to report peace, implying that they had not starved to death or died of anger. But this year, there was no news. I took a cold breath and silently wished that all our partners were safe and didn't die quietly.</p>
<p>Looking at the showcase on the other side, there were many expensive cakes and candies. We swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Two partners turned their heads to look, smiling sympathetically. We touched the five small silver coins in our pockets. We still had to get through six days before payday! Watching the Western-dressed young man, carrying two girls and carrying large and small bags, smiling and turning into the carriage, with a few "pop" sounds, a burst of air was released from the butt, and it started! We didn't know who's anger we were taking, pulled two partners, and ran!</p>
<p>Like three wild horses released from their reins, taking advantage of the post-drinking exuberance, we galloped on our road.</p>

<p>The father complained to his son: "You buy a lot of lottery tickets every time, and they always seem to fall into the sea; you think there's only one in 500,000 chance, how can you get your share?"</p>
<p>The son said: "In this day and age, the hope of getting rich is very small. Except for this one in 500,000 chance, I'm afraid I don't even have a one in 50.5 million chance."</p>
<h3 id="e201">One Copper <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The way Mr. Yin's family spends money is worth noting.</p>
<p>Mr. Yin is quite a handsome Western-dressed young man. Mr. Yin has set foot in all fashionable places. In particular, he frequents dance halls at least three times a week. In such places, although one does not necessarily have to be lavish with money, one would at least not have to consider every single copper before spending it. However, Mr. Yin seemed somewhat special. He spent money very freely in entertainment venues, but he would always argue with rickshaw pullers over a single copper, not hesitating to fight to see whose strength was enough to overcome the other.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yin is a typical Shanghai housewife, taking going to the theater, riding in cars, and playing mahjong as her daily life, with playing mahjong as her second life. If she doesn't play mahjong for three days, she will feel uncomfortable. When she plays mahjong, she can play day and night, and she doesn't care about losing ten or twenty yuan. But she also has a special habit. In the vegetable market, she often argues with vegetable vendors over half a copper or a single copper, both sides blushing and cursing each other's ancestors and descendants.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Yin, is Mr. Yin's mother, and also Mrs. Yin's mother-in-law, is a kind-faced, vegetarian Buddhist old lady. This old lady goes to Hangzhou every year to burn incense, and she doesn't care about spending one or two hundred yuan. In addition, she is always generous in donating money to repair bridges, build roads, and build pagodas and temples. Therefore, monks, nuns, and Taoists who come to solicit donations with alms books always receive three or five yuan from Old Mrs. Yin. However, yesterday this old lady ordered a maid to buy incense sticks, and the maid pocketed one copper in change, which was discovered by the old lady, who then scolded her severely. Moreover, this morning, she forced the maid to pack her bags and get out.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Record of Fragrant Mist <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because if you shake it too quickly or not carefully enough, often several sticks will fall out at the same time: this is considered a warning that the person's faith is not firm, and it is very unfavorable for their own or their family's illness, and they must shake it again. Sometimes, if you shake it too quickly, all the sticks may fall out together, which means that the deity is saying that the illness is incurable. Therefore, everyone is very careful when shaking the divination tube: if you encounter an enthusiastic temple keeper, they will also guide you from the side, so you can't help but give them some incense money! After shaking for a while, inevitably one stick will fall out alone, which is considered the indication from the deity in the dark. Then, the person seeking the divination carefully looks at the number on the stick, tells the temple keeper, and the temple keeper finds the divine prescription for them according to this number. The so-called divine prescription is the same as the divination verses we can see in various temples now, which are narrow and thin strips of yellow paper printed with a dozen or so kinds of medicine names: usually, a stack is strung together with thread and hung on the wall in order, and when needed, you only need to recognize the number and pull one off.</p>
<p>After the patient or the patient's family obtains the divine prescription, they naturally dare not delay, and rush to the pharmacy, mostly to the pharmacy closest to the temple. Nineteen out of ten of these pharmacies get their business from the temple, and the shop owner, out of gratitude, cannot help but reward the temple's manager or temple keeper. They purchase the medicine according to the prescription; fortunately, the medicine prescribed on these divine prescriptions is mostly mild and weak, and after the patient drinks it, even if it is not effective, in any case, it will definitely not immediately lead to death. So, divine prescriptions usually don't cause trouble! (210)</p>
<h3 id="e203">Silver Chamber Pot <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Indeed, geographers say, "The civilization and barbarism of a country depend entirely on the length of its coastline." Because a long coastline makes transportation convenient and cultural infusion easier; a short coastline obstructs transportation, and natural evolution is difficult. For example, countries such as England, Japan, Germany, and France have long coastlines and naturally become civilized countries; Congo and Uruguay, located in the interior of Africa, are naturally always barbaric nations. This is the geographer's well-reasoned proof.</p>
<p>But, we believe that "the civilization and barbarism of a country depend entirely on the number of chamber pots." Our reasoning is even more sufficient than that of geographers. Why? For example, friends who live in Western-style houses are naturally "civilized classes." They have flush toilets and porcelain chamber pots. Naturally, it is not appropriate to display chamber pots at the entrance of mansions and Western-style houses, let alone display domestic chamber pots. But when you get to the interior, with its rows of pit latrines and checkerboards of chamber pots, can't you use this to measure the civilization or barbarism of the area? Go further into the interior. You can meet chamber pots everywhere, round, square, long, oval, enough to be experimental teaching materials for geometry teachers. Porcelain, mud, coarse, fine, light-colored, purple sand, enough to see the development of our country's porcelain industry. We only need to appreciate the colorful chamber pots squatting next to the pit latrines, and without your investigation, you can know the civilization or barbarism of this place.</p>
<p>I don't know which Fenghua man invented a silver chamber pot to make his woman happy, making it a necessary item for the bride's dowry. If this treasure is not in the trousseau, it is not considered a good trousseau. The whole body of this silver chamber pot is oblate; there is a mouth on it, about only an inch and a half in diameter, and the circumference is four inches and six points. Such precise calculations, but raise a serious question. Because this treasure is shared by men and women: men of course have no problem, but for women, we admire their "perfect proportions."</p>
<p>Little Recipes</p>
<h3 id="e204">Winter Home-Style Vegetables <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and in the blink of an eye, the winter solstice has passed again; the north wind howls, the New Year's drums sound, and another year quickly passes. The year is so desolate, and all industries are so withered, yet a year's time passes like relentlessly flowing water. In these rich people's homes, the radiators are already warmly radiating heat, and the dogs kindly urge donations for disaster relief, and the donations have already reached a certain amount; soup kitchens have been opened, and porridge factories have also opened their doors. With a bowl of porridge and a bowl of rice, ordinary people can also strengthen their meals and eat more, without worrying about hunger. Sha Yu dares not say "rejoice in the joy of the world before others," but talking about recipes while basking in the sun or chatting around the stove is also a timely and beautiful thing, especially when it comes to home-style vegetables.</p>
<p>Biting on Vegetable Roots</p>
<p>"Warm clothes and a full stomach of vegetable rice"; "If you can bite on vegetable roots, there is nothing in the world you cannot do," which shows that there is a lot to say about a single vegetable root! Winter is the season for vegetables, which can be roughly divided into five kinds: green vegetables, cabbage, spinach, shepherd's purse, and yellow sprouts. Winter green vegetables are large, plump, and green, stimulating the appetite. Green vegetables, whether cooked plain or with meat, are sweet and delicious. Cooking porridge or rice with rice is fragrant and has a unique flavor. Two bowls of vegetable rice and a serving of cooked meat, basking in the sun and eating slowly, that kind of fragrant, sweet, and delicious taste is truly endless. Long-stemmed green vegetables, pickled, when they are just ripe, the color is tender yellow and translucent, and the taste is slightly sour, tender, and fresh, truly a good vegetable to eat with porridge.</p>
<p>The "braised stew" in Suzhou restaurants is a unique and successful delicacy; the dish is cabbage cooked with shredded pork, but it is fatty, crisp, and tender. When you eat it in your mouth, it is very tasty. The cabbage in the dish is stewed until it is so soft that it melts in your mouth, truly extraordinary. Cabbage and chili peppers pickled raw are spicy and refreshing, and can be eaten with porridge or to sober up.</p>
<p>Although shepherd's purse is a wild plant, it can be served at banquets and made into delicacies; stir-frying it with winter bamboo shoots is an excellent vegetarian dish in winter. Stir-frying it with chicken slices or shredded pork is also very tasty. Shepherd's purse and shredded pork can also be wrapped into "spring rolls," which are also exquisite snacks of the season!</p>
<p>Yellow sprouts are the most tasteless of vegetables, but they are the cheapest. Cooking them with chili sauce is quite good for eating rice, and is indeed an economical vegetarian dish for ordinary people.</p>
<p>Snow in Red and Radish</p>
<p>In addition to the five kinds of vegetables, "snow in red" and "radish" also have a considerable place in winter vegetables. The shape of snow in red is similar to green vegetables, but the stems are thin and round, and the leaves are also hairy like bird feathers; snow in red has a spicy taste when raw, and must be pickled first to remove the spicy taste before it can be eaten. The newly pickled snow in red has a color like emerald, clear and bright. When you bite it in your mouth, it is tender and fresh, and the deliciousness of the sweat cannot be described in words, truly the best vegetable to eat with porridge. Newly pickled snow in red, stir-fried or cooked in soup, is suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes, such as snow in red stir-fried with winter bamboo shoots, and snow in red cooked with fish fillet soup, which are all seasonal delicacies at banquets.</p>
<p>"Taihu radish" is as plump and tender as a pear these days. While eating hot pot, it is easy to cause throat problems, and raw radish is a symptomatic remedy for throat problems. Stewing raw radish with rock sugar is also a wonderful prescription for treating coughs. Radish cut into shreds and mixed raw, or cooked with salted meat, are all very good home-style dishes.</p>
<p>There is a side dish in temples called "old age," which is made by slightly pickling ginseng radish, then cutting it into small pieces with orange peel and green vegetables, stuffing it into a jar, and eating it about a month later. It tastes crispy and fragrant, and is very good for drinking wine.</p>
<p>In this winter dusk after a year of hard work, Yang Hui had already said: "At the end of the year, the wax sacrifices, cooking sheep and roasting lambs, drink wine to reward yourself." Winter is a time for enjoyment in life. Pigs have been raised fat, fish are also large and unparalleled, and even chickens and ducks are full of feathers, fat, and edible. Large pieces of meat, large strips of fish, as long as you have money, you can eat endlessly, but the year is so bleak, and under the drought, finding a vegetable root is already supreme happiness, and those vegetable roots are probably nowhere to be found! The north wind is gradually strong, and I sincerely hope that people who gather around the stove to keep warm and drink wine to reward themselves will remember the disaster victims struggling with hunger and cold, slightly restrain their appetites, and do a little good deed. That is the supreme merit! Immeasurable merit!</p>

<p>Sixty-four to Twenty-four Completely Submissive</p>
<p>The Mystical Aspects Are Impossible to Grasp</p>
<p>Watch Tomorrow Afternoon's Battle Against Jinan—</p>
<p>The Datong University Yixing Fellow Villagers Association, in order to relieve the drought disaster in their hometown, took advantage of the opportunity of the Central National Martial Arts Sports College basketball team's visit to Shanghai to continue holding disaster relief basketball games. Yesterday, a total of two games were held, both in the school's gymnasium. The first game was between Datong and Nanxing. The strength of both sides was balanced, and the scores were very close. Datong was more accurate in shooting, and won 42 to 39. In the second game, the National Sports College played against the East Asia Sports College. The National Sports College, with its well-practiced passing and magical shooting, was difficult to grasp. As a result, East Asia lost 24 to 64. The general situation of the two games is as follows:</p>
<p>Datong Wins Nanxing</p>
<p>42 to 39</p>
<p>Datong's basketball skills have improved a lot. At the beginning of the game, the three forwards scored in succession, taking the lead with 6 to 0, with great momentum. Nanxing was not willing to be outdone, and Liu Daqi scored under the basket, tying the score. After that, the scores were very close. Datong always led. The result of the first half was 20 to 18, Datong won.</p>
<p>In the second half, Datong continued to gain momentum. Nanxing's main player, Zhou Shu'an, was replaced by Liu Jiang in the first half, and did not return to the game, which inevitably affected his strength. Only Datong was seen dominating for a while. The largest score difference was 34 to 24. At this point, Nanxing seemed to wake up from a dream and suddenly became active. The score gradually advanced, chasing to 42 to 37. The situation was very tense. Finally, Datong's Zhang Daisong made a shot from afar, and the ball went into the net in response. Two minutes later, time expired, and Datong won 42 to 39. The battle records of both sides are as follows. Referee Xia Kaiming:</p>
<p>Datong, Throw, Penalty, Foul, Score, Nanxing, Throw, Penalty, Foul, Score</p>

<p>64 to 24</p>
<p>The Capital's Basketball League Champion, the Central National Martial Arts Sports College team, is making its second eastern expedition with a strong force. With Li Zhenzhong's return, it is like adding wings to a tiger. In the first game the night before, it won easily against Datong by a score of 40 to 12. Yesterday, in the second game, it played against the East Asia Sports College team. Both sides are known for their strong physique. The National Sports College's tactics are centered on Li Zhenzhong, taking advantage of his tall stature. The team's cooperation is very skilled. The magic of the long shots is amazing. Although East Asia is a new and strong team, it is difficult to resist. The contact began at 8:30, and within five seconds, Li Zhenzhong jumped up from the middle and scored. East Asia also returned the favor with Jiang Gaodi's score. The situation was equal, and the score was tied at 5 to 5. But from then on, East Asia did not improve. Both sides defended strictly, but East Asia could not take advantage of long shots, while the National Sports College often used short passes to disrupt the enemy's formation, and finally used long shots to score. East Asia could do nothing. The result of the first half was 32 for National Sports and 8 for East Asia. In the second half, the National Sports College was quite dominant in jumping balls. A few passes and they scored. Li Zhenzhong's skill under the basket is even better than Westphalen's. The Zhang brothers also have superb skills, close shots and long shots, all handy. East Asia was in a very difficult situation. The morale was not slightly slackened. In the last ten minutes, they calmly responded to the battle and did quite well. It was no accident that Jiang Gaodi and Pan Chengbin scored three goals in a row. It's a pity that the strength is difficult to compare after all. Zhang lost miserably with a score of 24 to 64, having exhausted all his abilities. The National Sports College has won both previous battles very easily. The school will rest today and will compete with Jinan tomorrow. I am afraid that Jinan is not their opponent either. The battle record last night is as follows. Referees Qu Yuesun and He Bin.

<p>The football matches of the Joint Independent Colleges Sports Meet started last week. Yesterday, the Sino-French Institute of Technology met the School of Commerce at the Fudan Affiliated Middle School football field. Both sides were evenly matched, and the battle was quite exciting. At the beginning, the School of Commerce gained the advantage and attacked repeatedly. However, the Institute of Technology's defense was solid, and the goalkeeper Lai Zishu was particularly agile, saving countless dangerous shots. At the end of the first half, neither side scored. After the lemon break, the Institute of Technology launched a major counterattack. Within the first ten minutes, Ye Chuanfu and Hu Mingkai scored two goals in a row. Soon after, Hu Mingkai took a corner kick, and the landing point was excellent, resulting in the School of Commerce's defender accidentally kicking it into their own net. As a result, the Institute of Technology won 3-0. The lineup of the Institute of Technology is listed below:</p>

<p>Public Donation Receipts for Viewing the Finals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal First Stadium, yesterday, entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal General Donation Committee for Disaster Areas, issued a notice to solicit donations for disaster relief. It stipulates that anyone who generously donates before 8 PM on the 31st of this month can use the donation receipt to watch the table tennis competition at the stadium. On the afternoon of the 31st of this month, at 8 PM, the match between the Guangdong team and the Langya team will take place. The skills of these two teams are well recognized by the people of Shanghai. Donating money can not only benefit the disaster victims but also allow one to watch an exciting table tennis match, which is truly a win-win situation. The method is that a receipt for two jiao (small silver coins) allows two people to watch, and so on. However, members participating in this table tennis competition can hold two two-jiao (small silver coins) receipts per team, allowing ten players to enter the stadium to watch (teams disqualified from the competition are not included in this rule). The donation collection point is the stadium office, and receipts will be given upon collection. The back of the receipt will be stamped with the Shanghai Municipal First Stadium logo. Receipts without the logo are not receipts raised by the stadium and cannot be used for entry.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Ministry of Education Section Chief Dai Investigates the Cause of Student Suicide at Zhongnan School <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Moral Education Should Focus on Individuality and Not Involve Kneeling or Slapping Hands</p>
<p>Wang Bonian, a third-year junior high school student at the private Zhongnan Middle School in this city, committed suicide by hanging himself on the 3rd of this month. The Ministry of Education sent Section Chief Dai Yingguan to investigate the truth. After investigating the cause of death, the only evidence was two letters left to his brother Wang Songnian and the school's moral education director Teng. After carefully reviewing the words in the letters, it is not difficult to infer the reason for his suicide. The first statement clarified that in view of the imminent demise of the country, he did not want to be a subjugated slave and die in humiliation in the future. Second, it was not caused by shame and anger from being subjected to a deserved punishment (i.e., kneeling), and it was actually not related to Director Teng. Third, please ask the school to quickly resolve a certain problem in the third grade (i.e., the problem with a certain physics teacher). Fourth, please ask his brother to take good care of his mother, and the school to treat his brother well. The student had a quiet personality and excellent academic performance, but his family was poor. Director Teng usually treated him quite well. Later, the student was dissatisfied with the physics teacher's lecture, and his attitude was slightly inappropriate. Director Teng ordered him to kneel for a long time. The student cried bitterly while kneeling. After returning home, he was unusually depressed and committed suicide the next day. His pessimism had been around for a long time, and a moment of shame and anger made him not want to live anymore. Therefore, the school is not legally responsible for the student's death. However, from the perspective of education, kneeling as a form of humiliation is not a proper method of punishment. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has ordered the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to warn the school and instructed all schools to pay attention to observing the personality of students in moral education in the future, provide good guidance, and not to engage in improper punishments such as kneeling and slapping hands.</p>

Based on his experience and far-sighted vision, Mr. Ma elaborated that the United States' increase in silver prices had a great impact on our country, but the Japanese took the opportunity to profit by exporting from Dalian and Hong Kong to the United States to buy cotton, weave cotton cloth, and dump it in China. He also used alerting words to awaken the youth, saying that this is a national and ethnic problem as a whole, not just a local problem of silver. The listeners were all inspired.</p>

<p>The social education delegation, jointly organized by the principals of public education centers in various counties of Shandong Province and the social education service personnel training class, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to investigate the social education situation in this city. The group consists of a total of 54 people. The members of the delegation and the itinerary are listed as follows:</p>
<p>The delegation is organized by the graduates of this year's Shandong Provincial Social Service Personnel Training Class. The leader of the delegation is Zhang Xuechun, the deputy leader is Wang Dian, and the instructor is Yang Xiangjiu. It is divided into five groups, with one group leader for each group. In addition to the students of the class, there are also the fifth section chiefs of the governments of Ling County, Gaomi, Jimo, etc., the director of the Guantao Public Education Center, the superintendent of Putai County, and the director of the Lijin County Normal School, totaling 54 people.</p>
<p>The delegation departed on the 13th of this month and visited the Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping, the Zouping Experimental County Government, the Sunjiazhen Cotton and Mulberry Cooperative, and the village primary school.

<p>Local impressions: According to Mr. Zhang Xuechun, the leader of the delegation, who spoke to the Shanghai social reporter yesterday, the goal of this southern visit is mainly social education, with a secondary focus on primary school education. In Nanjing, the Ordnance Factory Workers' Children's School and the teachers and students of the whole school are completely workers. The Santiao Lane Primary School is a rural school in the city, and they all have a spirit of hard work. In addition, the Qixia Mountain Rural Normal School is integrated with the village, and the results are very good. In Shanghai, the important goal is to visit social education institutions.</p>
<p>Shandong Social Education: According to Zhang, the leader of the delegation, the goal of the education sector in Shandong Province is to focus on the implementation of social education. The establishment of a training class for social education service personnel is to supply talents. However, the social education fee in Shandong Province is quite small, with an average of only four or five thousand yuan per county per year. Recently, the director of the Shandong Education Department advocated survival education, so that social education and school education are integrated. It is currently being planned for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Sending Off the Women's National Products Year <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and the vigorous Women's National Products Year has passed with time and become a historical relic. We silently observe the achievements of the past year, which makes people feel unspeakably sad. According to reports, in the eleven months of the country, women's cosmetics and clothing supplies amounted to more than two million yuan, and what is even more shocking is that in this amount of two million yuan, Shanghai accounted for more than three-quarters, totaling 1.6 million yuan. The Women's National Products Year, initiated by the women's community in Shanghai, has such a huge amount of consumption, and this contradictory behavior is worthy of people's criticism.</p>
<p>However, we cannot blame the enthusiastic women who initiated it. They have certainly done their duty to promote national products, but who would have expected the achievements of the past year to be like this? I am afraid that it was not expected by the enthusiastic women in the first place?</p>
<p>We should treat the past as if it were dead. For the future, we hope that women, especially women in Shanghai, will turn over a new leaf. It is not impossible to "know the times and be a hero." Of course, love of beauty is inherent in human beings, but it should be done under the principle of promoting national products!</p>
<p>Finally, the Women's National Products Year has passed. Women should not regard the end of the Women's National Products Year as the end of their responsibility. They should catch up quickly to recover huge economic interests for the country. I respectfully use this article to bid farewell to the Women's National Products Year.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Women Should Always Be Responsible for Using National Products <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Boshou</p>
<p>This year's Women's National Products Year is at the end of its strength. In the blink of an eye, it will be parting ways with us! On the track of advancing time, the five characters "Student National Products Year" have already been written in large letters, which clearly shows the great and unyielding expression of those who promote national products. This year's failure will still reap the success of next year.</p>
<p>But what we need to know is where is the cause of the failure of the "Women's National Products Year"? In a nutshell, it is because women have not worked hard and pooled their efforts. Especially some young ladies and wives have forgotten their responsibilities. Their worship of foreign goods has not been eliminated at all, so there are alarming reports of the number of imported lipsticks and perfumes, and the ironclad facts have given us a painful and failed lesson.</p>
<p>However, although the "Women's National Products Year" has disappeared like a wisp of smoke, wives and young ladies should still always be responsible for using national products! Because women are the masters of the family, they have the important task of raising children and the obligation to help their husbands manage the family. They must have a firm patriotic heart, manage the family in an orderly manner, eliminate foreign goods from the home, and advise their children not to purchase foreign goods, telling them the harm of using foreign goods. In this way, the idea of patriotism can be instilled in the minds of children from a young age. In this way, the "Student National Products Year" will definitely achieve practical results. Otherwise, no matter how hard the students work and how much they promote, will it not be the same as the relics of the "May 9th" and "May 30th" boycott movements in the past? Therefore, in the "Student National Products Year," women should still be responsible and always be responsible for promoting national products!</p>
<h3 id="e236">During the Student National Products Year, Production and Sales Should Pay Attention to the Needs of Students <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xi</p>
<p>The year of the Republic of China is called the "Student National Products Year." During the Student National Products Year, I think that both the production and sales of national products should pay attention to the needs of students.</p>
<p>What do students need? In the first semester of the 23rd year, the Education Bureau had already told the public that from this year onwards, students must wear uniforms uniformly. This is not only a large outlet for domestic woolen cloth, but also essential for the related parts. For example, Boy Scouts' black turn-down woolen socks, with each person buying two pairs, is also a not-small business. However, when I went to buy those woolen socks for my young child, I ran into many stores with sock factory signs, but when I arrived at the company specializing in national products, I couldn't find the prescribed socks. I asked the sales staff why they didn't have black ones. Their replies were mostly: "The factory doesn't make that kind of product, so we don't have it for the market." I told them that there is such a need now, and that both junior high school boys and girls have to receive Boy Scout training, so they can order from the factory, and there will definitely be sales. The above fact tells us that both the production and sales parties have not paid attention to the needs of the market. I think that the store's purchasing staff and the factory's designers should pay attention to educational news when reading the newspaper, which may be relevant and beneficial to their business.</p>
<p>After knowing the needs of the market, if there are items that we do not have in our national products, we can also discover the possibility of imitation. For example, Boy Scouts need to wear small knives. It is said that there are no national products for those small knives. Instead of secretly competing with your peers to manufacture the same goods, why not open up new paths? University students and middle school students all need safety razors, and junior high school students need Boy Scout knives. Please pay attention to the production and sales parties and supply them.</p>
<p>The production and sales parties should have the greatest cooperation and jointly seek a way out for national products. This is a major event that has not yet been fully achieved. In the "Winter Solstice Gift" window, the largest bookstore displays Western-style letter paper and envelopes in brocade boxes, as if domestic letter paper and envelopes are not suitable for exhibition! In the "Student National Products Year" of the Republic of China, I hope that the bookstores and stationery stores that sell exercise books will all use domestic paper to make them, cooperating sincerely with the production party. If there are really students who are willing to buy foreign goods, because they are all buying domestic products anyway, they will use them even if they don't want to.</p>
<p>To be honest, let me end this article. The above is the feeling caused by going to buy Boy Scout socks for my young child on the road.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Contribution to Chairman Chiang <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Recently, when Chairman Chiang left Nanjing, he issued a handwritten order, instructing the Nanjing Municipal Government to promote national products, stating that "the general public has a tendency to be extravagant, and they cannot be satisfied with anything other than foreign goods, which has led to the decline of domestic industries and an increase in the annual trade deficit. If we do not strictly correct this and actively promote the use of domestic products, how can we achieve national prosperity and national rejuvenation? In the future, we must order the general public, regardless of poverty, to use domestic products as the main priority, in order to cultivate the patriotic concept of the entire people and block the huge annual outflow." This is indeed a very important issue, and we can certainly understand Chairman Chiang's intention. However, promoting national products is not just a matter for Nanjing, so I think Chairman Chiang should extend it to all officials across the country to implement the use of national products. Now, I would like to contribute a few suggestions for Chairman Chiang and Mayor Shi of Nanjing to adopt.</p>
<p>First, I think Chairman Chiang should order all agencies across the country that people who wear foreign clothes are not allowed to enter the office to work, are not allowed to participate in any meetings, are not allowed to attend commemorative weeks, and are not allowed to visit their superiors. Those who violate the rules will be given a demerit for the first time, a fine for the second time, and dismissed for the third time.</p>
<p>Second, all public goods must not be purchased from foreign countries. Those that must be purchased from foreign countries (limited to those with no domestic substitutes) must first be submitted to the relevant superiors for approval.</p>
<p>Third, each agency should elect impartial staff to form a national products review committee to carefully review the goods purchased by each agency. If there are any doubts or proof that they are not domestic products, they may submit a request to the competent authority to order the general affairs to replace them.</p>
<p>Fourth, the original foreign goods in each agency should be certified by the national products review committee, listed and filed for future reference, and no more foreign goods can be purchased in the future. If foreign goods are found in the future, the national products review committee shall be jointly responsible.</p>
<p>If we can do this, I think promoting national products will definitely have a great effect!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Introduction to Domestic Silk Floss <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>The climate is getting colder with the wheels of time! The issue of winter warmth is urgently needed to be resolved. The general people in the current society mostly use woolen fabrics for winter clothing, which is neither economical nor practical, and most woolen fabrics are foreign goods, which invisibly creates a shocking huge trade deficit! I believe that domestic silk floss can at least replace some of the need for woolen fabrics. Anyone who has used silk floss admits that silk floss is light, soft, and warm, and it is indeed the only wonderful product for winter warmth!</p>
<p>Cocoons are the raw material for making silk floss; however, even cocoons made by the same silkworm are of varying quality. Double palace cocoons are white and tough, and are the highest quality of silk floss. The lowest quality is silk floss made from thin-skinned cocoons, which is dull in color, brittle in nature, and much less effective!</p>
<p>Silk floss is originally a sideline of farmers in western Zhejiang. The annual output is more than 10,000 dan, worth more than 3 million yuan. The best quality is produced in Huzhou and Yuhang. Every year, a considerable amount is transported and sold to other places.</p>
<p>The function of silk floss, whether for lining clothes or lining quilts, is extremely light, soft, and warm, and even if it is old and knotted, it can be light and warm as new after being re-lined. It is both practical and economical, so some people are increasing its use. However, in Shanghai, there are many counterfeit and inferior silk flosses, and it is extremely difficult to identify the quality. The main condition is that the fiber is uniform and the color is bright and clean as the superior grade. Some cotton merchants often mix bone powder, lead powder, etc. into the cotton in order to increase the weight and whiten the color. This kind of silk floss has a very good appearance, but the internal quality is very bad, and even after one or two years, it cannot be re-lined. Customers must pay attention: As for the silk floss mixed with kapok, the internal quality is even worse!</p>
<p>In short, silk floss is undeniably a good tool for winter warmth. In the current promotion of national products, I think it is worth introducing to readers.</p>

<h3 id="e240">A Record of Market Inspection in Southeast Asia (1) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>–A Conversation with Mr. Xiang Kangyuan–</p>
<p>The prerequisite for developing the national products industry is of course to expand the market as the first condition. Many people advocate developing in the country, but in recent years, rural areas in the interior have gone bankrupt, and people's livelihoods have been deteriorating, making it difficult to promote national products. Therefore, some people advocate developing in the Southeast Asian islands, because there are more than 10 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, who are all patriotic and like to use national products, but national products are not easy to buy and there is simply nowhere to buy them. If we take this opportunity to promote sales in that area as much as possible, it is indeed very promising. However, the promotion method is by no means effective if manufacturers proceed alone. We must unite our efforts and have a group organization before we can proceed. On this point, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan first advocated, believing that this is the most effective method. Mr. Xiang's advocacy is not based on empty talk. He has personally inspected the Southeast Asian market, and what he has seen and heard is more accurate. I will publish his opinions publicly for the reference of those who are enthusiastic about the national products industry. (Note: This article was originally written for the "Southeast Asia Intelligence" of Jinan University) Development of Southeast Asian Trade Special Issue)</p>
<p>(Question) Can you tell us about your motive for traveling to Southeast Asia this time?</p>
<p>(Answer) I know the close relationship between the Southeast Asian islands and our country. A long time ago, I wanted to travel there in person and enjoy the scenery of the South. However, due to the constraints of my duties, I have not been able to do so for a long time. This time, in order to understand the commercial situation in Southeast Asia and report the factory affairs to Mr. Hu Wenhu, the chairman of our factory (namely Kangyuan Printing and Can Making Factory), I decided to set off.</p>
<p>(Question) How has the trade of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia changed?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to my personal observation, the changes in the trade of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can be divided into five periods:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese merchants sell goods from Fujian and Guangdong and trade with the local people</p>
<p>(2) Chinese merchants sell goods from Fujian and Guangdong and trade with the local people</p>
<p>(3) Chinese merchants sell British goods and trade with the local people</p>
<p>(4) Chinese merchants boycott Japanese goods, and Japanese merchants trade directly with the local people;</p>
<p>(5) The colonial government implements restrictions on the import of Japanese goods in order to protect its domestic industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Because the Southeast Asian islands are the land opened up by our compatriots, the power of overseas Chinese has always been very great. Although the political power was later seized by Westerners, the economic power has always been in the hands of the overseas Chinese. About fifty years ago, almost all of the daily necessities of the local people were exported from Fujian and Guangdong. The overseas Chinese are all from Fujian and Guangdong. Based on the concept of loving their hometowns, they tried their best to promote the products of their hometowns to the local people in Southeast Asia. The local people felt that the goods from Fujian and Guangdong were novel and useful, so they were naturally happy to purchase them. During this period, Chinese merchants engaged in light-profit and heavy-trade transactions, so there were many who started their fortunes by this. Over a period of time, the machine industry in various European countries flourished, and our country's natural products and handicrafts were all defeated by them, thus occupying the original position of Chinese merchants. This is not surprising, Darwin's theory of evolution does not say "survival of the fittest"? Our products are not as beautiful as theirs, so you are not allowed to stand. Chinese merchants were hit by this and had to "catch up" to sell Western goods, especially British goods, to earn meager profits to maintain their lives. Changing from self-operating merchants to intermediary merchants planted the root of Western economic aggression. In the past ten years, Japan's industry has suddenly revitalized, and the whole country has been chanting the so-called "Southward Policy," and first used economic aggression as a pioneer to desperately dump industrial products to Southeast Asia. They have the power of politics as their backing, the transportation industry is developed, and the cost is relatively low. The same goods are cheaper than Western goods, and naturally welcomed by the local people, so the position of the Southeast Asian market has been dominated by Japanese goods. At that time, our overseas Chinese merchants had to go along with the trend and engage in the sale of Japanese goods. Before long, the Sino-Japanese issue gradually became tense. After the September 18th Incident, the situation was dangerous, and diplomatic relations broke down. Driven by conscience, our overseas Chinese aroused nationalistic thoughts and implemented an economic boycott of patriotic movement. All Japanese goods were refused to be sold. The Japanese are really good at observing the situation and changing their views. Since the Chinese merchants did not cooperate, they tried to trade directly with the local people. Japanese merchants are rich in experience in market promotion, coupled with the words "cheap and good quality" to attract the attention of the local people, it is naturally easy to get started. In addition to opening self-operated stores in various ports in Southeast Asia, Japanese merchants even have stores in the inland villages and towns. The facades are beautifully decorated, and radio tape recorders sing all day long, almost attracting the souls of the local people. The prosperity of the business can be imagined. There are also many shameless Western stores that are also promoting Japanese goods. If it were not for the colonial government's increase in tariff barriers, Japanese goods would simply be like mercury leaking to the ground and there would be no holes to enter. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e241">"Seeing off at the Wattle Gate, the Moonlight is Fresh" <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>In Kuta Hakuson's "Views on Nature Poetry of the East and West," there is a very interesting point recorded. He said, "Like that Erasmus, who was proficient in ancient literature and had a great deal of education, when someone asked him what he saw when he passed through the Alps, what touched his heart, he replied: 'Only the stench of a gloomy inn, and wine that was sour enough to kill a man.' This is indeed written in his letters. Going from Switzerland to Italy, the beauty of the mountains covered with snow for ten thousand years did not move his heart at all." This kind of person is simply too insensitive. The high monks of the European Middle Ages, when they traveled in Switzerland, are said to have stubbornly turned their heads away and refused to look at the beauty of the mountains and rivers, and this kind of person is a bit pretentious. In fact, literature and art are things that follow the times. What kind of literature and art we need in this era, we should have what kind of works produced. For example, taking the issue of rural areas, the ancient countryside is different from the modern countryside. Now there are still people who yearn to be pastoral poets, like Tao Yuanming, "Spring and autumn have many good days, climbing high and composing new poems. Passing the door and calling to each other, with wine to drink and measure. Farm work is done separately, and leisure often brings mutual longing. When longing arises, we put on our clothes, and talking and laughing never tire." I believe that modern farmers do not necessarily have that kind of joy. The countryside in the time of Du Fu and Wang Wei was "White sand, green bamboo, a river village at dusk; seeing off at the wattle gate, the moonlight is fresh." It was "The setting sun shines on the village, cattle and sheep return to the poor lane. The old man thinks of the shepherd boy, leaning on his staff, waiting at the wattle door." This is the situation of the ancient countryside, and I believe that the modern countryside certainly does not have such beautiful scenery, and the farmers certainly do not have that kind of leisurely mood of "seeing off at the wattle gate, the moonlight is fresh." The farmers' cattle and sheep may have been stewed by bandits and warlords, and the wattle door may have been demolished and burned. The old man may be locked in a prison sighing, and the shepherd boy may have already run to the city to pull a rickshaw. The various elements that constitute the beauty of the countryside have now changed. What it looks like when it's all broken apart, we who were not born in the countryside, of course, don't know very well, but if we close our eyes and think about it, the modern Chinese countryside is not very good-looking. I don't quite believe that there is still a village living a happy life, with a very fat and beautiful rooster crowing on the firewood, and a very pretty and simple little girl smiling shyly at strangers. There are beautiful peach blossoms in the yard, and you can go in and pick a branch to play with. If you are thirsty, you can go into the house and drink a bowl of water. If you happen to be there during mealtime, the host will let you eat something, and say, "The old man's family is poor, only old wine is available." I'm afraid this era has long passed. I know that modern, better villages have several guns. If a stranger goes there, they will probably think you are a scout for kidnappers. At night, the sound of gunfire is crackling and popping everywhere. If a pastoral poet from the city happens to live in the countryside for a day and a half, he will surely think that it is the sound of firecrackers on New Year's Eve. In the eyes of pastoral poets, everything is beautiful. The burnt, crooked houses, the plow for plowing the fields lying diagonally on the edge of the field, the green grass more than the rice, the trees with their tops cut off, and the well without anyone drawing water, with a board placed on it, these things, in the eyes of pastoral poets drinking coffee and tea, may be considered an unexpected beautiful scene. They are just like the high monks of the European Middle Ages, stubbornly turning their heads away and refusing to look at such a desolate scene in the countryside. Some time ago, I saw a piece of news saying that a certain place in the Northeast was recruiting workers to work, with a daily wage of two yuan and especially good treatment. So farmers from a certain place sold their family property to pay for travel expenses, and supported the old and carried the young to go to work. Until they reached a certain place, they met a group of previously recruited workers who said that the place not only did not give two yuan in wages, but was also extremely abusive. Everyone heard this and cried, hugging each other, because their way of life had been cut off, and they could not go back. The road ahead was茫茫, and they really didn't know what to do. Everyone thought that there was no other way but to cry, or else to die! I heard that someone is trying to provide relief, and I think it will just be giving everyone two corn buns to eat and be done with it. But the news of giving corn buns has not been heard to this day, and it may just fade away like this, and we don't know! From this small group of farmers, we can speculate on the situation of the modern Chinese countryside. Yet our poets, our artists, are still writing "Seeing off at the wattle gate, the moonlight is fresh!"</p>

<h3 id="e242">Christmas Concert <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Bai She</p>
<p>By chance, I entered the Moore Church, where a beautiful Christmas tree was erected in front of the door, and joined the black-robed pastors and the men and women of the choir, the white-collared gentlemen and the conductor of the string orchestra, the pure yellow-faced sacred virgins, the Christians wearing metal crosses, the large BASS, and all kinds of people "coming together to offer congratulations and toast." I'm not lying, this is the first time in my life that I've done this.</p>
<p>I usually don't have much spare money to buy tickets for concerts, but I have a great love for music, especially the kind of formal, religious music, which I have experienced very little. Therefore, this time I entered the "holy land," it can be said that I was driven by a kind of curiosity.</p>
<p>After the grand and solemn ceremony was held in the inner hall, someone handed me a brochure for the Christmas concert. It was exquisitely printed on high-quality Chinese paper. I looked at it and knew that today's performance would be Messiah. It was the first public performance in China. It was composed by George Frideric Handel, with lyrics entirely from the scriptures, selected by Charles Jennens. It was divided into three parts: the first part was Prophecy and Fulfillment, the second part was Passion and Triumph, and the third part was Resurrection and Glory. At the beginning, there was also a solemn, harmonious, and joyful overture, interspersed with the ancient song "Pastoral Music" passed down in the rural areas of Calabria, Italy. The entire piece was divided into fifty-three sections, and it would take a full four hours to sing it completely.</p>
<p>I really didn't expect what kind of effect a religious latent force would have on people's hearts? But after listening to the choir's singing, I seemed to have found the answer. When the tenor soloist sang the amazing chant, SAIHYORU GODSPEAK YECOMPORTBLYTOLCROSALENI, the entire audience was immediately silent, without a trace of sound. The hall was filled with wisdom, ability, dignity, glory, and praise. It was impossible for me not to believe that there was such a thing as God in this world. I was really surprised, and it can be said that my entire spirit was captivated by this harmonious and solemn tone. I didn't know that I existed. I only knew that this was an environment full of ancient style, wisdom, dignity, and glory. This was the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of the King of Kings.</p>
<p>The concert was performed section by section in order. A low chant from the contralto seemed to me to be listening to the whispers of the gods. Then, the mysterious sacred light was dazzling on the high cross. Adam, Eve, this is a very beautiful and abundant orchard······.</p>
<p>The strings suddenly slowed down, and finally died out. Then the hall erupted in a clamor, and the music conference was over.</p>
<p>Walking out of this holy land, this kingdom, the sky was drizzling with light rain. We, these people who "came together to offer congratulations and toast," suddenly became a flock of sheep in the dark night, but there was no glory of the Lord shining around. Standing in the rain waiting for the car, I suddenly realized like lightning: Messiah, sacred song, you spirit of music! Your "name must be called wonderful" because you are omnipotent.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Returning from the Volcano (6) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>The magnificent volcano</p>
<p>Has finally been reached!</p>
<p>Wisp after wisp of green smoke spews out from the mouth of the abyss, and my spirit suddenly becomes excited, and my steps are especially fast. My body is as light as a bird, and I am the first to walk to the crater teahouse.</p>
<p>This is a tea pavilion made of wooden planks. It can hold more than thirty people, and there is tea to drink, as well as fruit and soda water for sale, but there is no food to eat. At this time, the people resting inside and outside the crater teahouse are all watching me with tired smiles, and some old women are carefully looking at me from the top of my head to my heels.</p>
<p>There are two classmates standing at the crater teahouse who came with us all the way, and I almost don't recognize them. It turns out that everyone's face is covered with a layer of black ash mask.</p>
<p>The crater teahouse is the highest hill on the volcano, and the volcanic vent is still below. This section of the road is even more difficult to walk, because walking on sharp, multi-angled lava, you will break your skin if you fall down carelessly. At this time, I understood the blurred faces with bloodstains that I saw in the desert just now. It turned out that they were injured here. Although my heart was thinking that I should look at the ground and walk carefully, my eyes were actually staring far away at the gray-black smoke that was suddenly冒出来 from the crater in a daze.</p>
<p>The crater is here!</p>
<p>My spirit suddenly tensed up! The surrounding scenery immediately became solemn, magnificent, gloomy, and miserable. Everyone standing next to the volcano and looking down said in a terrifying and trembling tone: "Danger! The crater is really deep!"</p>
<p>No one had a smile on their face, and their eyes were all focused on the dark crater of the abyss. Maybe some of their friends had committed suicide here, and their sadness and sentimentality were beyond our imagination.</p>
<p>Before I came to the volcano, Jian'er told me: "The volcano cannot be visited. I don't know why, it has a kind of magic that lures every young man and woman. Everyone who has been there once always lingers on the volcano, and when they go there a second time, they bury their lives there."</p>
<p>At first, I absolutely didn't believe this, but once I got there, I was indeed bewitched by the magnificent volcano. I forgot the mission I was carrying, forgot the world, forgot all my relatives and friends. I wanted to die a tragic death, jump down, and end this painful and difficult life: but Dante's shadow immediately stood in front of me, his solemn face stopped me. His powerful arms embraced me, causing me to shiver unconsciously and take a step back.</p>
<p>"Dangerous!" A policeman guarding the mouth of the volcano said to me: he gestured to drive me away.</p>
<p>"Minasha, don't say SAYOUNARA to us!"</p>
<p>Ms. Yang was still joking with me, even though she was panting.</p>
<h3 id="e244">About Poetry <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Han</p>
<p>As an editor of a literary journal, one must have this experience: among the manuscripts he receives, poetry probably accounts for the majority, but there are few mature works! Or, if you happily go to a middle school to visit, as long as you carefully browse the journals and wall newspapers run by the students, most of the materials on them are also poetry, even so much that it surprises you.</p>
<p>Why is there so much poetry in particular? Maybe it's because poetry is easy to write? Isn't it?</p>
<p>Now, since we are talking about poetry, you must understand that first of all, you must recognize the particularity of the language used in poetry and the ideas suitable for poetry. Because thought and language are closely and inseparably combined, the technique of writing poetry is to use words to fix emotional experiences. Therefore, poetry has emotional, vivid, and metaphorical main components. Since words are used to fix emotional experiences, then poetry is the medium of emotion. However, these emotions and experiences are historical, social, and human emotions and experiences. Therefore, poetry does not belong to the poet personally, but is a product of society. It is a kind of abstract, historical, and social function. At the same time, it reflects the characteristics of the times in its own form. Broadly speaking, the subjective and objective significance of the social function of poetry is the reproduction of experience and personality education, and the reproduction of mass psychology.</p>
<p>If poets knew that poetry is a product of society, I'm afraid they would no longer be willing to groan without illness and produce shoddy works, right?</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Editors of literary journals, don't neglect the large number of poems submitted. You must carefully select and discard them. The large number of poems is the reason for production. Perhaps it is not because poetry is easy to write, but because poetry at the current stage is relatively easy to express the emotions of the current society, right?</p>

<p>— Original by Lin Fusao, translated by Shizuko</p>
<p>About a week later, he sent a letter.</p>
<p>(This morning, after picking up my mother's bones, they were completely packed into a jar that was less than seven inches high. Placing this jar in front of me, I deeply felt that this was a huge blow.</p>
<p>"When the funeral was held, ten female workers from the factory came. Those were probably all loved by my mother. It is said that there were even more people who were also requesting the factory to let them come to the funeral at least once, but of course the factory did not agree. And they all knew that they would be punished for running away. 丨This really makes my chest feel blocked and depressed.</p>
<p>"During the New Year's holiday, when my mother forbade me to drop out of school, I had made a plan. I wanted to find something to do with my own hands after entering university. In this way, I would also have a scholarship, so that my mother would no longer have to work, and my mother and son would undoubtedly be able to live. This plan lifted my spirits and gave me the courage to go back to school! However, now, what else can I say!</p>
<p>"With the urn in front of me, I thought丨丨about the invisible force that silently sucked away my mother's life, the organization of the world."</p>
<p>"Gradually shrinking two, gradually enlarged silk thread丨丨" Ink-black corpse of a pupa!</p>
<p>"My mother looked forward to my coming out of the mountains, this was her only hope. I also paid attention to fulfilling that hope. I only worked hard for this purpose丨However, what about now!</p>
<p>"But I don't despair. When I was picking up my mother's bones by candlelight in the crematorium in the mountains, a thought suddenly came to my mind. I felt that a new path had been opened up. 丨Cocoons are not just one! Suffering is not just for my mother!</p>
<p>"Even in this country we live in, millions, no," tens of millions of people, are like cocoons in boiling water, with an invisible blood vessel behind their backs, constantly sucking their lives.</p>
<p>"You may think it strange that I suddenly said such a thing, but I know who the opponent in the battle is. I will always have time to talk about the details. I suddenly remembered the time in middle school when I drew my knife to confront those who bullied me. But the path I am going to take in the future is not such a despicable path. It is a job that a man can bet his life on. My mother would also like it.</p>
<p>"I won't be coming back to school anymore, and I won't be able to meet you for a while. Please study hard and take care of yourself.</p>
<p>"Also, in the left drawer of my desk, there is a white cocoon. It is a wonderful souvenir, a souvenir of my mother. I would like to respectfully present it to you."</p>
<p>It has been ten years since then.</p>
<p>Even now, whenever I see a cocoon, I can't help but think of Sakai Yasuo. However, as I said before, I am a city dweller who can only see the moon and reeds in the display window to feel that autumn has arrived, and I hardly have the opportunity to see a cocoon.</p>
<p>But now, because I want to remember him, I don't particularly need to see a cocoon. (The End)</p>

<p>Slight Short Covering</p>
<p>Market Price Slightly Firmer</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange stopped trading in the December futures contracts, which will be settled on the 28th. The market is only trading January futures for one month, and February futures will be allowed to start trading on the 29th. Therefore, yesterday's trading was significantly reduced, and because the New Year and year-end closing holidays are approaching, there will be a total of five days off, including the weekend. The market slightly settled transactions to avoid changes during the long holiday period. Temporarily, the market price may continue to improve. If the issue of silver returning to Shanghai can be resolved, financial conditions will ease, and with the return of spot silver from other areas, the prospects will be optimistic. Yesterday, because the trading volume decreased sharply, the market was extremely quiet. Therefore, the market price fluctuations were influenced by only 30,000 to 50,000 transactions. The northern firms sold at the opening, mostly due to military downsizing, causing the market price to drop sharply by 0.45 yuan, while the others only fell by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. In the second session, trading was generally scarce, and the market price was extremely stagnant, fluctuating only by 0.05 or 0.01 yuan, with no significant gains or losses. The afternoon opening was because there was slight demand for the 5th issue, and the amount was limited, so the market price immediately became firmer and slightly higher. After entering 66, the price immediately rose by 0.3 yuan. At the close, there was slight short covering, and the market price gradually strengthened, becoming stronger and stronger. The 23rd issue suddenly rose by 0.5 yuan. As a result, the market prices generally improved by 0.05 to 0.3 yuan. The total number of transactions is shown in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yarn Market Soft but Upward</p>
<p>The yarn market is bland and unremarkable, and the situation is soft but upward. Because the final trading session in Japan at the end of the month jumped sharply, the intentions of the bulls became stronger and stronger, and the amount absorbed was stable. However, the selling price of Japanese yarn is lower, so the amount thrown out has not yet been compensated, and the market price is suppressed by it. However, the amount of yarn stored in the warehouse is decreasing day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Closing of the Cotton Yarn Bull Market <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for cotton yarn was stable, but after the third session, prices suddenly rebounded. This was due to the bull market investors holding onto their purchases without releasing them. New sellers remained hesitant, leading to a shortage of chips on the market. Prices for all months rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. However, current yarn sales were quite active. The afternoon opening was flat, but prices rose slightly after the second and third sessions. However, transactions were quite few. It was found that 1,850 packages were sold by Taixing, 250 packages by Tongji, 250 packages by Hengde, 200 packages by Yichang, 300 packages by Shenji, 200 packages by Taichang, and 200 packages by Shengyuan. 450 packages were purchased by Junchang, 250 packages by Dafeng, 400 packages by Zhenda, 350 packages by Shenchang, 1,000 packages by Yicheng, and 350 packages by Runkang.

<p>The cotton market has become firmer again due to the lack of new sellers in the market, resulting in a relatively dry market. Most of the large amounts remain closed and are not released. As a result, the market is tight and there are many buyers. In the afternoon, the current cotton sales market shows signs of improvement.</p>

<p>(Tianjin News) The cotton yarn sales market in this city is flat due to the severe cold weather and frozen river. Merchants from all regions are taking a wait-and-see attitude.

<p>Metal trading yesterday was not as lively as before due to continuous rain. However, popular goods such as plain white iron, shear-cut iron, local factory nails, and new lead wire were available, but in small quantities. Ultimately, due to the approaching end of the year and tight credit conditions, there was a sense of closure.

The detailed business conditions for each type are recorded below:</p>

The estimated price is around 26 yuan, and it is heard that there were only about a dozen barrels traded.</p>

<p>(No. 7) There have been quite a few sales in recent days, with an estimated price of 26.5 yuan per dan. Recently, due to the arrival of more goods, the market atmosphere is softening.</p>
<p>(No. 8) The Hongkou merchants on this street have been dismantling this type of variety for several days, with prices ranging from 25.5 yuan to 26.5 yuan per dan. It was found that the total transaction volume for the city yesterday reached as many as 50 or 60 barrels.</p>
<p>(No. 9) Printing factories and the Commercial Press both had transactions yesterday. The initial price was 25 yuan, which gradually increased to 26 yuan. It was found that the inventory of this type of goods is extremely low, and the market price is expected to increase further.</p>
<p>(No. 10) There have been very few buyers recently, and the market situation is quite sluggish. It is heard that there have not been many sales in recent days, so there is little accurate market information.</p>
<h3 id="e261">The American Yellow Eagle Brand Black Iron Sheet is in Great Demand and There are Rumors of Hoarding <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The American Yellow Eagle brand black iron sheet is an essential product for enamel factories, so each enamel factory must purchase this type of variety from the United States. Because of its superior material and soft nature, its selling price exceeds that of ordinary goods on the market, estimated at 12 to 13 yuan per dan. In the industry, only a few firms specializing in enamel factories and enamel factories purchase it. The remaining firms do not purchase it, so there are very few of these goods circulating on the market. Now that the enamel business is not very developed, the amount of goods purchased by each factory is also less than in previous years. Recently, each factory has suddenly experienced a shortage panic, so they are searching for it on the market. However, the inventory is extremely low, so those holding the goods have the intention of monopolizing and hoarding. As a result, the market price has risen sharply and has not stopped. The estimated price is 14 yuan, and it is heard that factories are still purchasing a small amount.</p>

<p>- Next Year's Opening Prices Are Expected to Rise -</p>
<p>After the opening of the futures market yesterday morning, the market for each month showed a consistent trend of firmness. The quotation for foreign wheat was 0.08 to 0.1 yuan higher for Chicago and about 0.08 yuan higher for Canada. When the prices opened, the current month was also quite active due to only the customer's withdrawal transactions, so the market atmosphere was lively. The market for distant months also tightened as factories were not selling and there were transactions outside the industry. When the afternoon market opened, the trading for the current month was still tense, with a strong sense of short squeeze. Because current sales were active, customer withdrawals and shipments were still tight, so the asking price rose step by step. The good performance of the current month also boosted the prices of January and February, while the rest remained flat. According to industry speculation, next year's opening prices may be expected to rise. As a result, the current month rose by 0.0325 yuan, January rose by 0.015 yuan, February rose by 0.01 yuan, March rose by 0.0075 yuan, April rose by 0.0025 yuan, and May fell by 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Wheat Prices Fluctuate Slightly <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was generally stable after the opening in the morning and afternoon. The quotation for foreign wheat was 0.08 to 0.1 yuan higher. At the opening, the current month was nearing its end, and both bulls and bears were settling their transactions. The market showed mutual exclusion. Distant months trended sideways due to sluggish buying, with little fluctuation. When the afternoon market opened, it initially rose by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan due to the good performance of the flour market, but then fell slightly as profit-taking bulls returned. After that, if flour sales remain active, the market is expected to rise. As a result, the current month improved by 0.01 yuan, January improved by 0.02 yuan, February was unchanged, and March improved by 0.01 yuan. In the current wheat market, due to the scarcity of arrivals and thin inventory, mill demand is still active, with high-quality goods up by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan, and medium-quality goods up by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. Shandong Guide wheat opened at 4.09 yuan, secondary at 4.05 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 4.04 yuan, secondary at 4.00 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 3.97-3.98 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.94-3.95 yuan, and Hankou wheat at 3.83-3.84 yuan. 5,000 bags were shipped by Huafeng and Shenda.</p>

<p>- Active Consumption in Mainland and Local Streets -</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was lively due to the revival of local customer demand. Furthermore, the price drop the day before had aroused inquiries from mainland and local streets. In particular, secondary Saigon rice was welcomed by all parties, and the market price immediately rose by 0.1 yuan. Other Siamese machine rice and broken rice also improved by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. A total of 6,000 bags were traded. Both sides held firm on futures rice, with only 200 tons of Saigon rice being withdrawn. The arrivals and inventory of customer Xian rice have been lacking in recent days. Mainland and local street consumption is still active, and the market is gradually becoming firmer. The afternoon was particularly active, with 1,500 bags of Shashi rice and 550 bags of Xianghan machine rough rice being offered, with prices each improving by 0.03 to 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Due to Rain, River Rice Transactions are Limited <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) With continuous rain, only 24 or 25 boats arrived (carrying nearly 5,000 shi in total). The market color showed tightness. However, the sales market has not been smooth. There were not many transactions for each type of goods. Hou Geng and late rice prices rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan due to the scarcity of arrivals. In fact, the overall situation was also dull. Each variety such as Du Yangjian and Yin Bian Yuan remained stable with no profit or loss due to similar supply and demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 20 to 30 boats arrived from the river. Due to the rain, the sales market was bleak for all types of goods. The market price for white rice was high and stable, while medium and secondary grades were slightly weaker. The price of white yuan was stable. Early thin rice was slightly lower by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Yang Du was generally flat. The tip of the customer's pier was slightly tight.</p>

<p>- Still No News from Sesame Foreign Telegrams -</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market price continued to rise by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, and transactions were still numerous. Dade New Oil Factory continued to purchase 1,200 bags of Guide soybeans at a price of 3.65 yuan. Three vehicles of Yingzhou aged soybeans were sold at a price of 3.69 yuan. Mainland Xichang, Chefang, and local streets purchased more than 3,100 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans at prices ranging from 3.48 to 3.28 yuan. 300 bags of Han Chi soybeans were sold at a price of 3.31 yuan. 200 bags of Shashi soybeans were sold at a price of 3.28 yuan. Five vehicles of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans were also sold at prices of 3.95 yuan and 3.94 yuan. 52 bags of Andong large-grain soybeans were sold at a price of 4.45 yuan. Currently, the overall situation, in terms of the sales market, is not a situation where prices will rise by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan. However, hindered by the continuous supply, there has been no major increase. The foreign firm had sent a telegram for sesame at 9.15 yuan the day before, but there was no news yesterday. The situation is still not very promising. Yesterday, only Shaobang purchased 370 bags of Bozhou sesame at a price of 6.54 yuan, 344 bags of Bengbu sesame at a price of 5.35 yuan, and 250 bags of Mingguang sesame at a price of 6.20 yuan. Local tea and snack shops purchased 50 bags of Guandian sesame at a price of 7.20 yuan. Dongyangbang purchased more than 300 bags of Bengbu sesame at a price of 6.10 yuan. Shantoubang purchased 169 bags of Jiujiang milk sesame at a price of 6.65 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's bran market showed slight fluctuations. Fuxin bran was slightly softer due to the stability of foreign wheat. Yesterday, the asking price was 2.70 yuan. Miscellaneous bran was lively due to active demand from mainland groups, so the price was also strong, with asking prices reaching 2.71-2.72 yuan. In the future, bran prices are expected to remain stable as each factory does not have thick inventory.</p>

<h3 id="e284">Fifteen Yuan Per Person for a Big Meal <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Blowing</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was Christmas Day. All countries in the world celebrated the birthday of Jesus. The national palace hosted a banquet for 700 poor people. The German capital entertained 12,000 poor children. Austria granted amnesty to show Jesus's spirit of sacrificing himself to save people. Shanghai, because it has so many Western residents, therefore welcomed the night of revelry. A certain garden dance floor and restaurant's business was very prosperous for five yuan, and announced that it was full. The dance floor was also extremely crowded. Green wine and red lights, what kind of world is this?</p>
<p>Fifteen yuan per person for a big meal is originally not surprising. Some restaurants sell each big meal for thirty or forty foreign yuan. Some restaurants sell each big meal for up to fifty or sixty foreign yuan. This kind of big meal is only for important people from various countries and wealthy merchants to learn from. Poor scholars cannot even talk about trying it. It is said that on the day before yesterday, in a certain garden, only one-tenth of the foreign gentlemen came to learn from it, and our compatriots who came to learn from it were as many as nine-tenths. Such a place of entertainment, a night of revelry, life in this world, grand events are not always held. "Enjoy today's wine today, worry about tomorrow when there's no money tomorrow." This is originally what several gentlemen with minds as bright as "fireflies" do.</p>
<p>There's a saying: "A rich family's banquet, a poor man's half-year's food." This ancient saying should still be revised now. "A rich man's meal, a poor man's year's food." This year, famine is everywhere, and the number of disaster victims is too difficult to count. Tree bark and grass roots cannot even provide a full meal, and people are even starving to death in ditches everywhere. According to yesterday's newspaper report, the relief association sent a large number of people to various provinces for disaster relief. A total of nineteen provinces suffered from disasters. Starting today, they will first go to Anhui, Jiangxi, and other six provinces to investigate and provide relief. The relief funds require 30 million yuan, etc. Because there are so many disaster victims, 30 million yuan has been raised. How much can each hungry person get? If the gentlemen attending that night could save one big meal, it would be saving the lives of several hungry people. If you add the cost of dancing, it would be enough to save the lives of dozens or even hundreds of people. It's truly "behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot; on the road lie the bones of those frozen to death." Isn't this kind of phenomenon enough to move your sinking minds?</p>
<p>"Embracing a bosom full of soft jade and fragrant warmth, ah! Liu Ruan entered Tiantai!" Who can break this kind of confusing front? They would rather sacrifice their lives and ruin their families to save enchanting and beautiful dancers than save a meal and a dance to save hungry people dying in ditches. Therefore, some people say that humans are emotional animals. Looking at it from this perspective, I don't believe that this statement has any truth. Xunzi said, "Human nature is evil; those who do good are false." His words are somewhat similar. Therefore, "At the beginning of man, his nature is good," this kind of book is originally deceptive and should be burned.</p>
<h3 id="e285">The Spring of Zishi Street <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— New Green</p>
<p>The third year of Xining in the Song Dynasty's Shenzong era.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful spring that couldn't be dispelled.</p>
<p>Pan Jinlian walked Wang Po to the door. Returning to her bedroom, she felt an inexplicable heat in her body, and sweat oozed from her back like rice paste.</p>
<p>Pushing open the ancient louvered phoenix-tail window, there was no wind outside. Willow catkins floated, floated, like cotton.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's already the season of falling flowers, no wonder the weather is so hot."</p>
<p>She leaned lazily against the window, picking her teeth with a small bamboo stick, looking at the white clouds in the sky, planning how to enjoy a joyful tomorrow. Those handsome eyes, that prominent nose, that tall and strange face, that clear and charming voice, ah! My Ximen Qing, my beloved Ximen Qing: You are truly the source of my life, the treasure of my soul.</p>
<p>She smiled. She rejoiced that she had achieved victory and was able to hide it from Wu Dalang, who was nominally her husband but actually as withered as a child, and satisfyingly obtain a new lover. | | Ximen Qing | |</p>
<p>She planned, how to send Wu Dalang out tomorrow? And what kind of words to use to tell him to spend the night in Yuncheng? When he | | Ximen Qing | | comes, what generous and kind way should I use to greet him? How should I entertain him? And how should I express my full enthusiasm to him? How should I tell him about my myriad thoughts? She decided: first, embrace him and give him a hearty kiss to vent the five years of suffering 丨 丨 丨 not married to 丨 丨 not sold to 丨 丨 Wu Dalang for five full years.</p>
<p>Thinking of the happy times, the blood boiled throughout her body, and her limbs and bones felt as comfortable and light as if they had been ironed with an iron.</p>
<p>Suddenly, another dark shadow, like a sharp arrow, painfully gnawed at her heart. "Honor," "A woman's most precious honor!" She understood that once she fell in love with Ximen Qing, not only would she be subject to the most severe moral sanctions and be despised by everyone, but perhaps the discovery of the crime would also lead to unimaginable punishments. And that cruel punishment would inevitably be a severe sentence ending her life's journey. She hysterically fantasized about the final, inevitable stage: it seemed that a layer of black mist was covering her eyes, and in the mist, she was already tied to a small cart, with a burly man escorting her in a parade on the street. As she walked, she shouted, and countless men and women, old and young, pointed at her and cursed:</p>
<p>"Look at the shameless slut!"</p>
<p>"Look at the slut who poisoned her husband and deserves to die!"</p>
<p>Ah! Slut, such a terrible slut. She suddenly shuddered, and cold sweat soaked through her skin. As if waking from a dream, she pinched her leg hard and fiercely. She gently called out to herself:</p>
<p>"Pan Jinlian! Pan Jinlian! You've been smart your whole life, don't be confused for a moment and do something despicable to shame your ancestors!"</p>
<p>She quickly bit off the small bamboo stick she used to pick her teeth, expressing her determination to jump out of the trap. She realized that this was a critical moment of distinguishing between good and evil, humans and beasts. She wanted to move upwards, she wanted to be human, and she had to tearfully abandon her and Ximen Qing's first love affair. She casually opened the calendar hanging on the rosewood bamboo bed and silently recited the "Jade Calendar Response Chapter" attached to the end of the scroll, trying to use the power of the imperial Taoist gods to dissipate the emotions that were about to erupt. But in fact, although she tried her best to restrain herself from thinking about Ximen Qing again, Ximen Qing's shadow lingered around her, making it impossible for her to escape. In an instant, a thousand troops and ten thousand horses were galloping in her mind:</p>
<p>Handsome eyes... prominent nose... his tall and strange face... clear and charming voice... slut! slut!</p>
<p>Her fluctuating nerves were as chaotic as a tangled pile of firewood. She felt a terrible suffocation and painfully clenched her teeth. Her face was as red as fire.</p>
<p>There was no sound in the courtyard, under the clear sky.</p>
<p>In the spring breeze, a song faintly drifted over:</p>
<p>"Drink! This mead-like mellow wine,</p>
<p>Rejoice! This flower-like spring night;</p>
<p>Youth will not return, time easily grows old!</p>
<p>Wait for the years to change,</p>
<p>Winning only white hair."</p>
<p>She listened blankly to the song and then sobbed softly.</p>
<h3 id="e286">When the Sun Slants <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Weinan</p>
<p>The smoke from the cooking fires billows out of the thicket over there, at this time when the sun slants: somewhat softly embracing these forests, not letting people see, the light red that it smears, some of it quietly seeps into the clouds, slowly assimilating into the haziness of the cloud shadows, in the fleeting moment of the setting sun's afterglow, and it is vividly transforming in the midst of nature!</p>
<p>The red halo of twilight covers the face of the western sky, like the face of a banqueter who has drunk mellow wine to the point of intoxication; this great intoxicated-like vast sky is nurturing boundless commotion. The clouds are so drifting, but sometimes they will gradually transform in this azure sky, but when she approaches this western sky at dusk, she will put on rouge on her face just like the modern girls in today's city. Of course, this kind of dressing up is also to charm the vast sky, right?</p>
<p>On the wilderness under the cloud shadows and the sky's overlook, and on the protruding mountain peaks, small shadows of people and animals are scattered, with many quivering white dots, naturally these are flocks of sheep. There are sounds of laughter and the singing of pastoral songs, this here is naturally a few herding children. The people in the fields over there, of course, are farmers, diligently doing the growth of what they hope for, afraid that the sun will fall down immediately, they are hurrying to do what they inevitably need to do. Autumn harvest is now already</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>not good, not doing other things, preparing for the spring planting work, would be even worse. In their hearts, there is only working hard, moreover the current "famine" is firmly stuck to their bodies. Their burdens include their children who are crying out for food, the weakness of their aging parents, the unbearable cold, and the burden of taxes, ah, these oppressions are unavoidable and will come upon them from time to time, loosening their grip even for a moment will lead to starvation: but there will be even more terrible things to come, that is, inexplicable man-made disasters and tragic natural disasters! Now they are working diligently, afraid that there will be nothing to do tomorrow, and furthermore, that cursed sun, ah, it is tired and wants to hide below the horizon to rest. Those crows are even more deceitful, cawing and calling their companions, "It's night, it's night," preparing to return to their nests to sleep. The flocks of geese are also flying in lines towards the sky, and what is fanned up under their wings is bringing the milky white news of the night.</p>
<p>The women at home are busy cooking dinner. The clothes and children's diapers that were drying on the racks outside are all gone. The sparrows on the eaves are chirping and preparing to go into the crevices of the tiles, afraid that their companions have not yet returned, as if they are calling out there. In the hall, the chickens are clucking and walking to their roosts on their own, the dim room is even dimmer, the fire in the stove in the kitchen is red, and the pot is cooking dishes, preparing for the weary husband or her son to return.</p>
<p>The children in the wilderness are driving the cattle and sheep, whistling and going home vaguely, closing the cattle well, tethering the sheep well, and running towards the kitchen, clamoring to their mother and older sister for food. With their innocent hearts, they do not understand the struggles of their parents!</p>
<p>At this time, the curtain of night is high, and they are still working hard: the wilderness is hazy, and the distant forests and mountains are naturally combined into a pitch-black mass.

<h3 id="e287">The Concubines Raise Their Heads <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanjing was published in various newspapers the other day, which read:</p>
<p>"The Judicial Yuan, based on a telegram from the Qinghai Higher Court requesting an interpretation of whether a 'head of household' has the right to file charges in cases of a concubine committing adultery, has been resolved by the Yuan's Uniform Interpretation of Laws Conference. Since the 'head of household' and the concubine do not have a spousal relationship, the 'head of household' naturally has no right to file charges when the concubine commits adultery with another. This decision has been telegraphed back for notification."</p>
<p>This is a rather pleasing matter. In China, the popularity of taking concubines truly surpasses all other nations. Anyone with a bit of property generally seeks happiness in this area. Having one concubine is not enough, and after a while, they become tiresome, so they acquire another, and another, and another, until there are countless. For example, the late Zhang Zongchang did not even know how many concubines he had. When he breathed his last, there were a considerable twenty-four who came forward to mourn. As for those who took only one or two concubines, they were too numerous to count within the four seas. The former Doctor of Law, Wang Chonghui, stated that he could not clearly define the crime of "a married man committing adultery" because three out of ten Chinese men took concubines. If they were to be convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, the whole country would be filled with prisons, so it was not possible to clearly define it as a crime. I think Dr. Wang's statistic is probably seventy to eighty percent accurate (whether his argument is correct or not is another question, and need not be discussed here). This shows how numerous concubines are in China.</p>
<p>Now, the judicial authorities have clearly stipulated that if a concubine commits adultery, the man has no right to file charges. This is truly a delightful event. I think that not only will the concubines rejoice, but those of us who see this will also applaud and cheer endlessly. (Please forgive me; I do not harbor any ill intentions.) Going forward, concubines, who have been deeply oppressed for thousands of years, although they may not be able to immediately reclaim their personal dignity, freedom, and independence, can at least engage in some scandalous behavior. For example, a petite and charming concubine of eighteen paired with a white-haired old man will definitely not be able to achieve balance in terms of sex alone, let alone satisfaction. This will very likely lead to extramarital affairs. If they are bold enough, they might as well do it openly, since the old man can catch them in the act but has no way to prosecute, leaving him to "beat the rocks and cry to heaven."</p>
<p>Men who love to take concubines, have you seen the telegram above? While women are certainly good for seeking pleasure, this time you have run into a major obstacle.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Treatment for Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Editor: I have long admired you as a guiding light for those who are lost and a mentor for the unfortunate. I have a problem that I would like you to answer. I am currently eighteen years old. I met a girlfriend last year who is kind and approachable, and I love her very much. Our feelings for each other are excellent. Recently, she suddenly proposed marriage, demanding that I marry her, but I dare not agree because I have an unspeakable difficulty. The thing is, when I was sixteen years old, I was young and ignorant, and impulsively masturbated, causing me to suffer from nocturnal emission for two years. Now, I have an emission about once every ten days, and I often experience dizziness and fatigue. I know the condition is not mild and want to see a doctor for treatment, but I don't know which doctor is the most suitable. If I don't seek treatment, will it interfere with marriage in terms of physiology? Because she and I are best friends, if it interferes, wouldn't I be harming her if we marry? The above question has made me hesitate for a long time. Due to concerns about my reputation, I dare not express it to others. I specifically ask for your reply. Also, I think there must be many pitiful people in the world who suffer from the same disease as me. If you would kindly publish your reply, the beneficiaries would be in the thousands, and not just me, who would be grateful beyond words. Yours respectfully, Jin Pinyi</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Many young people, due to external temptations and impulsive desires, commit masturbation, causing this kind of harmful error to their bodies. They feel pain in both body and mind and are filled with regret. However, we believe that nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. As long as everyone can realize this, can be determined to change and start anew, then there is hope to eliminate this bad habit.</p>
<p>Regarding nocturnal emission, according to what the editor knows, there are two types: one is physiological, and the other is pathological. Physiological nocturnal emission is a phenomenon where a healthy body with strong blood and sufficient essence inevitably overflows, with one or two emissions per month. After the emission, there are no morbid states such as lack of energy. This type of nocturnal emission does not require treatment and will naturally stop after marriage. There is also a pathological nocturnal emission, which requires attention. Pathological nocturnal emission is mostly caused by masturbation, or evil thoughts during the day, or reading inappropriate books and paintings, etc. The milder symptoms are once every few days, and the severe ones are like this every day. The most severe becomes spermatorrhea, with emissions without dreams, and occasional hallucinations during the day, which immediately lead to emissions. After the emission, there is dizziness, blurred vision, fatigue, and the body gradually becomes emaciated. Some may even become infertile as a result. If not treated quickly, it is extremely dangerous. However, according to what general physicians say, drugs are rarely effective for nocturnal emission. It is necessary to resolutely eradicate past evil thoughts and habits, absolutely not to look at inappropriate books and paintings, not to watch certain tempting movies and dramas. At the same time, during the day, one should use proper work to exhaust one's body as much as possible so that one can sleep soundly at night. Alternatively, one can decide to study some science and concentrate all thoughts on this science, without thinking about anything else. If a person suffering from spermatorrhea can implement such fundamental treatment from all aspects, then his symptoms will definitely gradually heal.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin's nocturnal emission is pathological, but it does not seem to be severe, so he need not worry too much. As long as he can be determined to implement the above methods, I think he will certainly regain his health and enjoy the pleasures of life. However, it is best not to talk about marriage for the time being until the emissions stop. If the other party misunderstands, you can get engaged first and then set a date for the wedding in a year or two. Furthermore, Mr. Jin is only eighteen years old now, and there seems to be no need to rush into marriage.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "End of the Year"</p>
<p>Busy and rushed until the end of the year. Winter with wind and snow in the twelfth month. Wealthy families have everything prepared. They have already prepared wine and sacrifices to the ancestors. The whole family gathers for a feast and drinks wine. Collecting rent and settling accounts, gold and silver are abundant. Acquiring property and adding more fields. There is still surplus capital to generate interest. Poor people suffer the most at the end of the year. Their hearts are filled with worry like oil being fried. Last time, they paid official grain and private debts. Clothing, firewood, rice, and other necessities are not enough. Children cry, daughters wail, and female servants complain. They beg relatives and friends, revealing their shame. Begging and pleading are useless. They only provoke separation and cold laughter. Rushing and scurrying until the thirtieth of the year. The sound of the drum echoes, and they sigh in despair. The ancients said that the poor look forward to the coming year. How can one dig a well when one is already thirsty? Remember to prepare ahead of time.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Boudoir Sentiments"</p>
<p>Pillows and mats feel cool, the jade dew falls in autumn. Proud chrysanthemums stand firm east of the fence. Easily time passes like a blink of an eye, the years do not wait for me, already in the ninth month of autumn. Green trees and silver flowers reflect in the curtain. Beyond the clouds, the sweet fragrance of osmanthus blossoms in autumn. Dewdrops fall on the wutong tree, like rustling rain. Leaves fall from the maple tree, the sound of sorrowful autumn. The ever-changing vicissitudes of life. The metal wind brings the chilling autumn. (Thinking of you at home) Leaving the hometown, how shallow are the feelings, aimless wandering not knowing autumn. Eight silk skirts empty and cold. A bed of brocade quilts sighs in the cold autumn. Lazy makeup disappoints the delicate and shy appearance. Chrysanthemums are not inserted, temples are in disarray like autumn. Weary birds still know the day to return home. Swallows chirp happily, welcoming the autumn. Hong gathers in the south, paired in pairs, seeking a phoenix, meeting a bird singing in autumn. Deep within the boudoir, hidden remnants of love. Leisurely composing new poems to bid farewell to autumn. Return, return, you must chant. Uprising forest colors how many autumns. (In the coming years) Planting bamboo and flowers, leisurely walking. Side by side, punting boats on five lakes in autumn. Lovebirds and butterflies, truly gentlemen. As if in the heavenly Guanghan Palace in autumn. Looking back on the past like a lifetime ago. Raising eyebrows in joy, obtaining autumn. (In the future) Generations of descendants enjoying the joys of spring and autumn.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Good Intentions Become Bad Intentions: Movie Stars' Greatest Fear is Fans <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Li Bin</p>
<p>There's a Western saying that snails are animals undisturbed by the outside world, only able to hear extremely loud noises. However, movie stars, whether Chinese or foreign, especially those in Hollywood, cannot enjoy such tranquility. Because of their status, they are often subjected to special disturbances from the outside world. Even the adoration of fans, although stemming from admiration, sometimes increases their suffering. Thus, good intentions turn into bad ones. As for the curiosity of fans, treating stars like monkeys in a cage, that makes stars feel even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich originally lived a leisurely and happy life in Hollywood. Later, a newspaper published her photo with her home address noted underneath. As a result, the number of people making pilgrimages to her house every day was countless, some walking, some driving, some cycling. They constantly rang her doorbell, sat on her lawn, and parked their cars haphazardly in front of her gate. One day, things got out of hand. An entire family arrived, bringing three generations of ancestors with them. They treated Marlene's lawn as their campsite. They brought cameras, autograph books, telescopes, and picnic food. At noon, they gathered for a meal, opening cans of salted olives, tins of sardines, and jars of pickled cucumbers. The bottles, cans, paper wrappers, eggshells, sweet potato peels, etc., were scattered all over the ground. The younger ones jumped and shouted. The middle-aged ones pretended to pick flowers, peering into the windows. The elderly slept in the sun, smoking and reading newspapers. They were all waiting for the star to come out and greet them. They waited until late at night, and when she didn't appear, they left. A week later, Marlene Dietrich moved.</p>
<p>Everyone says that camera work is a necessary path to fame for movie stars. However, stars fear cameras outside the studio most, especially beautiful male and female stars. Because in the studio, the cameraman must make them look good, with appropriate angles, and prevent their shortcomings from being exposed. But once outside the studio, they have no protection whatsoever. Unprepared photos have become a temporary trend. The group of people who steal photos of stars must wait for the stars to be inattentive, or extremely funny and ugly, or in embarrassing situations, so the photos can be sensational and win. Therefore, a dollar spent on a simple camera can produce results as bad as those taken by an expert. The expert, on the other hand, has to go to great lengths to capture unexpected photos of stars. Only these grotesque photos can be sold for money. But these grotesque photos are what stars hate most. However, they cannot avoid the attacks of malicious cameras.</p>
<p>Hunting for stars' autographs is as feared and unavoidable by stars as hunting for their photos. In unfortunate situations, a star can be surrounded by a hunting group, and signing their name for half an hour won't be enough to satisfy them. These signature hunters surround the entrance of the studio, guard the vicinity of the stars' residences, and patrol the hotels and places where stars often appear. Like photographers, they can be encountered on the streets, tennis courts, and boxing arenas. Recently, Joan Crawford encountered a group of people who stopped her car on the street, not letting her leave until she signed countless names, large and small. The largest was signed on the back of a coat. Watching movies is sometimes a necessary task for stars, but when they encounter curious people, they are at their wit's end. There is a kind of person called "pre-screening front row dogs". They rush into the theater early on the night of the first public screening and sit in the front row, right next to the seats specially reserved for the stars. When the lights go out, the movie starts, and the stars arrive, they turn around and kneel on their seats to watch the movie stars. It's not so bad if they just watch, but they block the stars' view.</p>
<p>The attacks of the crowd are also something that stars fear. They can encounter unexpected events before and after performing on stage, at the entrance of the theater, and in the studio. Compared to such attacks, signing a few names or giving people some funny photos seems much kinder. Maurice Chevalier was once surrounded by a group of middle-aged, plump ladies as soon as he stepped out of the dressing room. After introducing themselves, they suddenly launched a preemptive strike, everyone acting at once, some pulling his tie, some grabbing his handkerchief, some tearing the buttons off his clothes. Chevalier, seeing that the situation was not good, turned around and ran back. He fled into the dressing room and immediately closed the door. But he thought that these women, who could run into the studio, must have something to do with business. He couldn't afford to offend them, so he opened the window and waved to them with a smile, but he didn't dare go down again.</p>
<p>In the eyes of stars, journalists are respected but kept at a distance. They dare not offend them, nor dare they avoid them. Anyone who treats journalists arrogantly and rudely, offending them, they will unite and, without launching a blatant attack, simply resist a little passively, and then you are doomed. The recent failure of Katharine Hepburn's performance in New York can serve as an example. Tracing back to the beginning, the reason why journalists follow stars to collect news is nothing more than out of good intentions, admiration, and a willingness to do free publicity.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Review of "Rebirth Flower" - New Light <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>After "Sister Flowers" broke the box office record for Chinese films, it caused a great uproar, which led some film writers to pay attention to the reasons for the success of "Sister Flowers." Other works were also more or less influenced by "Sister Flowers," and it was no accident that the author of "Sister Flowers" came up with a sequel under this reputation.</p>
<p>In attracting a large audience to watch "Sister Flowers," when they had never been interested in Chinese films, the author of "Sister Flowers" certainly made a great contribution. At the same time, "Sister Flowers" is also an immortal record in the history of Chinese cinema. However, what worries us is that Chinese film writers are catering to the audience's tendency and cannot bravely correct it. That is to say, when the audience accepts the film, the writers cannot bravely further improve the audience's appreciation level. For example, everything in "Rebirth Flower" has not exceeded "Sister Flowers" in any way. It is in the same rut as "Sister Flowers."</p>
<p>"Sister Flowers" is the highest-grossing sound film in China. "Rebirth Flower" is also a sound film, but ordinary people do not feel very satisfied after watching these two works, when they have seen many advanced foreign sound films. Furthermore, the audience needs highly developed sound films. For example, the success of "Peach and Plum Calamity" has won a lot of praise from the audience, which proves that people are demanding that Chinese sound films strive to improve their standards.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that "Rebirth Flower" is the same as "Sister Flowers," whether in terms of content or creative techniques. Here, the author's consistent style is maintained, and like the latter part of "Daughter's Sutra," those so-called revolutionary sermons and the posture of those revolutionaries really make us unable to believe that it is a true depiction. If we observe from the costumes of the characters in the play, the so-called revolutionary ladies of Erbao's type, of course, refer to the present, which is explained in the most fashionable cheongsam. Then, in the author's view, the officials and warlords played by Da Xinyuan, Tan Zhiyuan, Wang Xianzai and others in the same era as Erbao should all have their "lives taken away". However, from the costumes of the Northern Warlords, we understand that it was the previous generation who were being revolutionised, and those unprincipled revolutionary heroes were also figures of the previous generation. ...... Here, the author's cleverness is fully expressed.</p>
<p>In addition, the relatively messy editing and the lack of sophistication in the dialogue have prevented the film from achieving full success. Other things are omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e297">Talking about "Bigamy" <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>I just came back from Suzhou and saw "Bigamy" being screened at New Light. I was dragged by a friend to watch it.</p>
<p>That's right, "Bigamy" is Wu Cun's first contribution after joining Star, and it is also the first collaboration between Gao Zhanfei and Gao Qianping. We have read Wang Pingling's article on the content of this story in the "Literary Monthly", but today, what we see on the screen is very different from what was in the article. Perhaps this is because articles and movies cannot be expressed in the same way?</p>
<p>Here, the playwright only grasped a very ordinary story, but because of the appropriate handling and the vivid personalities of the characters, it can easily arouse the audience's empathy.</p>
<p>It depicts an old couple in the countryside who are diligent and thrifty in their lives. When they send their son away to study, they recall their love and hard work twenty years ago. They eagerly hope that their son will become an official and make progress, but who knows that their son indulges in lust and even calls his father an old servant in front of his lover. Finally, he is accused of bigamy by two women. The development of this story on the screen is quite smooth, and the rhythm of the tone is also very peaceful.</p>
<p>In this film, the director has put a lot of effort into the handling and progress of the shots. For example, Xie Yunqing's two special shots behind the cigarette holder, and the close-ups of Gao Qianping, Yan Yuexian, and Gao Zhanfei's expressions are all techniques that should not be missed.</p>
<p>There are also many humorous places, such as Xie Yunqing's country bumpkin not knowing the doorbell and going to press it again and again. The life photos of college students, using dance magazines as extracurricular reading, climbing over the wall in the middle of the night, a fat man accidentally falling into a water tank, groping in the dark and accidentally stepping on a washbasin, and male students holding chairs to learn to dance are really funny, and inside, there is also a criticism of the corruption of modern education.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Xie Yunqing is the most successful. Yan Yongxian's facial photography is too dark, and the rest are competent.</p>
<h3 id="e298">Grand Premiere of "Rebirth Flower" <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>The plot of "Rebirth Flower" is more poignant and moving, and more twisted and regrettable than "Sister Flowers."</p>
<p>When Sister Flowers was released, many viewers sat in the theater, moved to tears. From the opening until Erbao rescued Dabao from prison and took her away, the audience was slightly relieved. But a disappointing feeling surged to their hearts: Dabao was taken away by Erbao, what happened afterwards? This meant they had to see the sequel to "Sister Flowers," "Rebirth Flower." Therefore, countless viewers longed for the premiere of "Rebirth Flower," which they had been eagerly anticipating. As a result, the entrance of the New Light Theater was crowded with traffic every day, and many viewers had a sense of looking at the ocean and sighing. Presumably, "Rebirth Flower" will set a new record and invigorate this silent Chinese film market.</p>
<h3 id="e299">"Flying Flower Village" is a Booming Success <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>The Art-China Film Company's singing blockbuster "Flying Flower Village", which is currently being screened at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater, is well received by society because everything depicted in the play is reality, and it has a sharp exposure of the sins caused by urban material civilization. It also has a profound depiction of the contradictory psychology of rural women who are tempted by material civilization, and since its opening on the 25th, the audience has been extremely enthusiastic, and the prosperity of the box office is comparable to the prosperity of "Woman" when it was screened in Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Su Hua</p>
<p>The women waiting for him outside swarmed over and surrounded him. He laughed, sang, and kissed frantically; but who would know that this was Suria? She knew of his wildness at the door, and everyone inside greeted her as a dancer. A dancer who had just come in from outside asked her: "Are there any Americans tonight?" Another dancer named Marcia also told her some gossip about the dance hall. By chance, she saw Donner, who ran over to kiss her. They sat together. Marcia took out a very beautiful and precious garter from her leg and showed it to her, saying that Donner had given it to her. Suria took it over and saw that it said "From Jamie to Dorothy" inside. Suria thought that this Donner was really shocking. So she said her own name was Phoebe. When Donner moved closer to her, she said as if she were experienced: "It's not very good tonight, no Americans came. Are you a banker?" "No," Donner replied. She said disappointedly: "Ah! Aren't you? I'm only suitable for bankers. Do you understand what I mean?" Later, Donner ordered the waiter to open a private dining room on the second floor, room number seven. He tricked her into going in. A waiter went in with champagne and glasses, and then went out, and the door was closed. She looked at the room, which was simply furnished like a bedroom. This made her rush out again, almost knocking the waiter over. She had no choice but to go back. Donner softly said to her: "If you only like bankers, then the door of this room is not locked." Suria stared at him blankly. She understood his good intentions in her heart. She slowly walked to the door, her heart struggling with the question of whether to stay or leave. Donner saw this situation. He got up, locked the door, turned off the lights, and leaned in slightly. After waiting for a while, Donner opened the door and went in to see that she had not only not changed into her pajamas, but had also put on all her clothes. "What does this mean?" he asked in surprise. She pointed to the portrait of Napoleon hanging on the wall and said: "He failed at Waterloo because he attacked too early." Donner was so angry that he was speechless and embarrassed, and said angrily: "He failed at Waterloo, that's right, but what you're doing is too immoral." After he finished speaking, he opened the door and left angrily. He sat outside the door in a daze. Marcia came to push him, but he refused to move. The intoxicating music downstairs sounded, and the moving melody provoked everyone's emotions. Suria opened the door and walked closer to Donner. Looking at him gently, she said: "Let's dance." But he rudely refused. She had no choice but to go back to the room. She was disappointed, just like she was in her own garden before. In tears, she regretted coming here. The door suddenly opened, and Donner walked in, helped her up, and said softly: "Let's dance." At first, they danced as if they were strangers. But the soft music soon intoxicated them. Lips facing each other, eyes looking at each other. They had forgotten everything in the world. After a clear song, Suria felt involuntarily. Donner carefully held her and put her on the bed. Looking at her ecstatically, they had both received supreme comfort. When he leaned down to kiss her, Suria passionately asked: "Donner, do you love me?" He replied strangely: "Of course, why not?" She looked at him and carefully said again: "You have to understand, I'm asking if you really love me?" Donner happily replied: "Forever, until tomorrow." "What about after tomorrow?" she asked somewhat panic-stricken. "You're being a bit funny," he stopped kissing her, straightened up, and replied. She asked again: "Has anyone asked you this before?" "Not here," he replied lazily. She asked again: "You like the women here the most, don't you?" (To be continued)</p>

<p>Sai Jinhua's real name is Chuan Caiyun. She was a famous courtesan in the northern district. She married the top scholar Hong Jun at an early age and followed Hong on missions to various countries. During the Gengzi Rebellion with German General Waldersee, Waldersee was the commander of the Allied forces and led his troops into Beijing, where they looted and killed extremely brutally. At that time, Hong Jun had passed away and Sai resigned and returned to her old profession, changing her name to Sai Jinhua. She witnessed the tragedy and felt deeply saddened. She went to persuade Waldersee to issue strict orders to stop it, and many people were saved as a result. After the founding of the Republic of China, Sai was old and married Senator Wei Sihao. Not long after, Wei died and Sai was incompatible with Wei's family, so she drifted outside. Now Sai is over sixty years old and lives in a small alley in Beiping, number four, in a desolate state. These are her recent portraits.</p>
