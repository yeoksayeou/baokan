<h3>對孫軍事决定實行圍剿何召傅徐等會商結果</h3>
<p>晉綏軍擔任東北兩路</p>
<p>甘寗青部隊任西南面</p>
<p>金尊華謁何雙方意見相距尙遠</p>
<p>（北平）何應欽今晨召徐永昌傅作義商震萬福麟秦德純蔣伯誠等、在居仁堂會商對孫軍事計劃、已决定、晋綏軍担任東北兩路、甘寗青部隊担任西南兩路、實行圍剿、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）何應欽今日上午邀徐傅等會議、今晚何邀宴徐傅、再度會談、徐傅此來、係就商晋綏部隊出動等問題、結果尙無定議、仍待詳商、但軍事上各方已有相當凖備、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）昨來平輸誠之孫部副軍長金尊華、已謁何報告一切、當局因孫迄無離軍表示、足證並非誠意、在孫未實行離軍前、一切均難談到、孫意因所部皆爲其一手訓練、不忍遽去、須當局對其生命安全予以保障、始可離軍、但在離開前、心將所部人馬稍事整理、故雙方意見相距尙遠、事件解决、猶待詳商、寗垣近郊連日僅小接觸、孫軍曾猛攻省城七晝夜、終未得手、死傷甚衆、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）徐永昌·傅作義·連次謁何、對處置孫軍計劃、大致商妥、其重要事項、對孫之最後勸告、如無效時、卽實行晋綏甘寗青五省會剿、金尊華謁何、要求三項條件、一、孫離開軍隊、卽由軍分會保證其身體安全及居住自由、二、孫軍遵照軍分會電令撤至　口以北、請求恢復該部餉項給養、三、孫軍實行縮編後、請求軍分會發給編遣費、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）此次于世銘向寗夏方面接洽投誠之各部、均係于之直屬部隊、大半爲騎兵、孫之基本部隊如丁綍庭·劉月亭兩旅、現尙無表示、料不易脱離孫之覊絆、今據馬來電、孫殿英仍有企圖攻下寗城之意、刻孫已親赴前綫指揮、并作續攻寗城凖備、故寗馬方面認于等之接洽投誠、或恐有詐、現已停止進行、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）出動晋綏甘寗青各路軍隊、卽可對孫實行圍剿、聞東北路决由傅作義等擔任、西南二路由馬步芳·馬鴻逵·朱紹良等部擔任、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）孫軍進攻寗垣、因無砲兵、改用雲梯爬城、寗軍仍以水遍澆、城墻均結爲冰、孫軍爬城遂失效用、寗垣變爲水晶宮、亦戰中之趣聞、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）歸化電、晋軍出動後、已繼續西開、王靖國俟傅返綏、卽赴臨河督師、廢年除夕起孫軍向寗夏城作三次猛撲、激戰甚烈、雙方死亡極多、但寗城未被孫軍攻下、綏西民力憊疲、已不堪再供應行軍、晋軍向雁北各縣征騾馬、以備軍用、河套糧秣草料來源已絕、行軍殊困難、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）軍方息、晋綏軍出動、就其實力、解决孫部、自非難事、徐傅來平、有擬再向孫勸告一説、事或有之、但關鍵在孫本人是否有悔禍誠意、且須立卽遵守軍分會前次電令、將所部撤歸磴口以北原防地、聽候整理縮編、否則一切均難寛容、（十七日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）何應欽電京報告、謂孫殿英野心難馴、但其部下中下級軍官、深明大義者、頗不乏人、對孫舉動、極表不满、惟處其滛威之下、莫敢如何、現分會已電孫作最後勸告、將所部交于世銘負責改編、如孫能遵照離開軍隊、則此事卽可和平解决、否則當由五省聯軍澈底圍剿、以免戰事延長、（十七日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英日商務會議之前途</h3>
<p>據外電英日商務會議。已於本月十四日在倫敦英政府商務部公署内。舉行初步會議。該日除兩國工商業代表出席會議外。尙有政府指定之代表列席傍聽。聞會議之主要目的。在力求兩國商業競爭問題之圓满解决。換言之卽如何得和衷共濟分割世界之市塲是也。日本爲遠東產業最發達之國家。英國在遠東勢力。亦已根深蒂固。此次會議結果。對於遠東市塲之發展。尤有莫大之影響。殆可斷言當此英日兩國經濟戰爭日趨激烈之際。乃忽有海外市塲妥恊運動之談判。其意義之嚴重可以想見。</p>
<p>夫英日關係之密接。由來久矣。大戰以前因英國與帝俄在世界舞台上之明爭暗鬥。乃有英日聯盟一幕大戰終結。日勢漸盛英國爲避免對美遠東關係惡化起見。遂有廢盟之舉。華盛頓海軍條約。定英美日海軍主力艦之比率爲五、五、三、英日關係卽不若前此之融和十餘年來。日人養精蓄鋭。盛修軍備。近且佔領满洲。覬覦華北。倡亞洲門羅主義。以遠東主人翁自居。使英人在遠東之勢力基礎爲之動摇。不但此也。日本乘目前國力發展之會。傾銷其低廉之貨物於各國。幾於無處不與英國之商品與資本發生衝突。甚至在英國之重要殖民市塲如印度。亦作無情之競爭。予英國商務以重大打撃。至是英日關係。頗有愈趨緊張之勢。夫英人兩三年來之對日固未嘗不欲其恊調之贯澈也。然而英日之經濟利害。則如犬牙交錯雖經西拉姆會議之成功。以爲英日在印度市塲之調節。然猶須有倫敦談判。以促進在世界市塲上之携手焉。</p>
<p>彼英國乃擁有廣大殖民地之國家。但今日内部團結已日趨渙散。倫敦政府之統治。漸感不支。於是英帝國之整個外交方針。除維持海外商品推銷及投資市塲外。又不得不兼顧各殖民地之情形。本此原則。故不但在印度委曲求全與日本維持利益均沾之恊調。卽對其海外之整個市塲。亦願在可能圍範内開放。使日人分得一　。但英人如此厚意。日本尙不肯貼然就範。以爲兩國恊調。當以英帝國爲限。意若曰。英國以外之市塲。如南美如中國如歐洲各小國。吾猶有餘勇可賈。不辭爭一日之雄長也。是以倫敦談判。現雖進行。前途暗礁正多。吾人在第三者地位觀察。認爲成立英日間分割市塲之妥恊。恐鮮希望。老謀深算之英人。果尙有掙扎之餘力。</p>
<h3>美國全部海軍仍將集中太平洋</h3>

<h3>英不承認僞國</h3>
<p>國聯發表英政府文書</p>
<p>郵政問題提交委員會</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英國不願採行含有承認满洲現有政局意味之任何舉動、此乃觀一月八日來文而可顯見者、英政府來文中附有長春郵務司藤原一九三三年九月十六日一函、請英國依照萬國郵政同盟之條文、予以統計、俾清算郵件經（满洲國）者之轉運費、英政府乃請國聯將此事提交一九三三年二月二十四日成立之顧問委員會、庶可明白規定外國郵局與满洲郵局間所許有事實上關係之範圍、而不致涉及满洲現有制度之承認、國聯秘書長愛文諾現已召集該顧問委員會於五月十四日考慮此事、按此顧問委員會之設立、乃備國聯大會之顧問、且襄助大會辦理監視國聯所通過關於中日爭議的議案爲人維護之工作、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯今日注意於英國與、（满洲國）雙方郵局之爭執、（满洲國）郵局傳遞英國郵件、而英國郵局亦傳遞（满洲國）發來之郵件、如此辦理、已有多時、但（满洲國）近請英國郵局塡具郵政同盟下之某種必要統計、故英政府乃請國聯决定可與（满洲國）郵局發生關係而不致涉及承認（满洲國）之範圍、按（满洲國）似欲以此爲試騐案件、俾至少可在郵政上獲取承認、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英外相西門今日在白萊頓演説、言及軍縮問題、發一疑問曰、明知列强不能接受、而偏作列强應解除軍備等於德國之提議、究有何益乎、試問美國或日本能依允之乎、如各國能成立限制軍備之恊定、則世界史卽開新紀元矣、若在此方面之努力竟歸失敗、則世界將復陷於製造與備置戰具之無節制競爭中、其結果有非吾人所能預測者云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）航空次官沙遜氏、本日在牛津保守黨聯合會演説、以明顯之詞、主張發展英國空軍、略謂英國軍用飛機供戰鬭前綫之用者、僅二百架、而最近之鄰國則有九百九十七架、以歐洲現狀而論、此種情形斷乎不可、英國片面實行裁軍、已至極點、遇此限度、便於國家安全發生不利、國際間非可長治久安者、若英國誤以目前和平狀况長久可恃、則將發生危險、在如此形勢之下、英國應要求各國空軍平等、而平等實現之法、宜使他國空軍减至與英國空軍相等之程度、至於軍用航空、如予以廢除、則領土上空、將爲民用航空强大之國家所控制、此非英國所能爲也云云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美議員提案財部收買白銀</h3>
<p>倫敦銀市堅穩</p>
<p>（華盛頓）衆議員史克魯安已在衆院提出一議案、主張由財政部收買白銀、每月至少二千五百萬盎斯、以六個月爲限、此後每月續收一千萬盎斯、至收進白銀共達十萬萬盎斯之總額、或金銀比價已達十六對一時而後已、此案規定如物價超遇一九二六年一月一日之價格、則每月購銀之數、可减至四百萬盎斯、此案又規定收買白銀、用銀劵付　、此項銀劵在贖回、可按照當時黄金等價用银條贖回、而贖回之銀劵、仍用以購進白銀、衆議院擁護白銀之議員已决定創立百人委員會、以費新格烏領袖、銀派委員已發出一决議案、贊助由財政部每月收買五千萬盎斯、以十萬萬盎斯爲限之提案、而此提案規定照市價收買白銀、付以銀劵、將來可用黄金贖回、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦銀市近日堅　、因衆信美政府爲銀派議員所左右、不久必有舉動也、前途情形、尙無把握、但預料美政府必將照比較公開市塲稍高之價格收買紐約所存大批白銀、近日美元價疲、其故殆在美國投機家購進英鎊、以便轉購遠期白銀也、但倫敦收買黄金、亦爲美元疲弱之一原因、蓋金價以英鎊計算、與以佛郎計算、相差無幾、故收買佛郎、或從法蘭西銀行提出現金、現已不復有利可圖也、佛郎表同情於美元、繼續下降、（十七日路透電）</p>

<h3>鳩山文相舞弊案日政府非常狼狽</h3>
<p>調查委員會要求解釋</p>
<p>齋藤將犧牲文相求全</p>
<p>（東京）十七日上午之查問委員會、决定要求鳩山及三士兩大臣出席十九日會議、政府聞此消息、非常狼狽、正午特於議院内召開閣議、商議關於樺太工業公司之問題、以免小山法相及鳩山文相兩人在該委員會之説明彼此齟齬、本問題雖於法律上無犯罪性質、然爲敎育府大臣之鳩山、由背任侵占之人物收賄金錢、而被迫出席於全國注視之查問委員會、實與政府體面有關、且其對於齋藤内閣之影響亦非淺、政府當局對於鳩山文相之辭職問題、似有重大决意、以計内閣不受影響前解决一切問題、然查問委員會之結果如何、足使各方面彈糾現内閣對於綱紀問題責任之聲勢强大、衆議院内部外部及貴族院之反内閣空氣必定激化、故文相决定其進退之時、卽爲現内閣最危險之時機也、（十七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>接受賄賂文相陷於窘境</h3>
<p>齋藤處斷頗堪注目</p>
<p>（東京）政府因台灣銀行事件有關綱紀問題、曾在兩院言明並無不正、但查問委員會無論以何方法調查、恐難獲得確證、惟成爲問題者、樺太工業之藤田常務與鳩山文相之授受金錢、載明於檢事局記錄、故無可如何、若議會對卽往事件追及政治道德之責任、則除台銀問題外、將爲鳩山文相之個人問題、因此將於暗中慫恿鳩山文相之自發的引責、而防止政局之危機、若鳩山文相迴避、將如何處斷、故齋藤首相之裁斷、頗堪注目、（十七日電通電）</p>
<h3>查問委員會明日開始調查</h3>
<p>要求文相鐵相等出席</p>
<p>（東京）關於岡本一已議員之初調查會、日本上午十時開會、由島田俊雄爲委員長、先决定調查範圍後、卽進行調查、國民同盟及民政黨方面主張除岡本議員外、如鳩山文相·三土鐵相·米田鐵道秘書官等必要人物、均須訊問、加以澈底的調查、是調查會於開會之前、空氣已極險惡、前途波瀾必多、（十七日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）查問委員會對於政友會内紛、與岡本議員之態度、現爲各方面重視、政府認鳩山文相與樺太工業公司背任侵占案之關係、不過係供給政治資金之行爲、並無犯罪性質、表面上呈樂觀狀態、然查問委員會雖不信鳩山文相有不正行爲、然又無足以一掃關於文相疑惑之確實證明、長文敎府者卽然有疑惑、而爲各方非難、則於十七日衆議院會議國民同盟提出關於文相之緊急動議、雖可以多數勢力否决、但衆議院如斯空氣必對貴族院有重要影響、鳩山文相假使因此問題不得不决意辭職、則政界情形更爲複雜、政友會以緊張態度注目文相行動、（十七日日聯電）</p>
<h3>政友會内部分裂愈趨深刻</h3>

<p>（東京）政友會之望月圭介·島田俊雄·兩總務、昨與山口幹事長會於某處、關於津雲國利等五名除名問題、愼重恊議之結果、以僅在議塲之行動、予以除名處分之重大處分、無此名目爲理由、結果决定置諸不問、故鈴木總裁鳩山文相派所主張之除名問題、暫行取消、然查問會之結果、鳩山文相果與綱紀問題無關、而有與岡本一已通謀與以支持之事實發覺時、再考慮除名問題、（十七日電通電）</p>

<p>意國政府曾提議、英法意三國同時在本國京城發表公報、宣布三國共抱尊重奥國獨立與土地完整之志願、意國所以有此建議者、蓋豫防外間或起三國對於此事根本原則意見歧異之流言也、按奥總理杜爾夫斯博士前宣布奥國擬向國聯呼籲、旋經英法意三國致覆、發見彼此意見之未一致、蓋意國殊不以此種呼籲爲然也、巴黎人士以爲三國縱發表尊重奥國獨立與土地完整之宣言、然奥國仍　隨時請援於國聯云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）意政府草定奥國如受外方干涉由英法意三國担保其獨立與土地完整之宣言書、請英法加入、俾共同發表、英法兩國已予拒絕、因此舉含有贊助杜爾夫斯政策故也、聞英政府拒絕此請、實因英相麥唐納忿杜氏治内政策之故、如必欲英國加入者、須於此點有所聲明云、聞法國亦持同一態度、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此間接巴黎電訊、法外長巴爾都擬聯絡英意及捷克政府共同發表維持奥國獨立之宣言、刻已失敗、因巴爾都與駐巴黎各該國大使及公使進行此事之談判、至午夜時已破裂也、柏林各報云、英國掌　大臣艾登昨晚已抵巴黎、據稱、英國無意贊助法國此種主張、因此舉無補於實際、而徒然激怒德國也、意國前曾提議列强以武力維持奥之獨立、然亦爲英大使所阻、因英國不欲捲入可引起歐洲大陸紛爭之漩渦、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>奥國獨立歐洲均勢要素</h3>
<p>法國會决議維持和約</p>
<p>英法意捷克亦曾保障</p>
<p>（巴黎）最近外聞傳説、倫敦·巴黎·羅馬間進行談判、擬由三國同時發表宣言、認奥國獨立及領土完整有予以尊重之必要、談判不日卽可得到結果、此項消息今昨業經證實、發表宣言之議起於羅馬、而各國之態度又與奥國最近事變相關、緣各國對奥國命運雖甚注意、然對於應取之行動則不免稍涉游移、但自最近維也納及林茲社會黨起事之後、各國已不再游移、奥國政府前曾以關於德國國社黨在奥國擾亂事件之案卷分送英法意三國政府、同時並聲明奥國擬求直於國聯會、三國政府對奥國來文業已答復、三國政府在原則上對奥國表同情、但對於保護奥國獨立之方法則意見頗有參差、意大利對於求直於國聯會一層繼續表示懹疑、三國復文措詞卽各不同、他日發表、恐將爲人所利用、羅馬政府因此乃提議、由三國政府、以完全相同之文字、同時在三國首都發表宣言、表明三國欲保障奥國獨立及領土完整之公司同志願、如此表示之後、則外聞所謂維持奥國獨立一層、在各國不過爲次要之事一説、可不攻自破、此種宣言、於奥國之求直於國聯會、亦無妨碍、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院外交委員會舉行非常會議、研究奥國事變、一致通過决議案、要求政府保障奥國獨立以維持和平、參議院外交委員會意見、亦以奥國之獨立及其領土完整爲維持和平及保持歐洲均勢之必要條件、和平條約卽予以保障、而一九三二年十月英·法·意·捷克·四國所簽之議定書、亦承認對奥國予以保護、但其保護應受國聯會之指導、並於國聯會範圍之内行之、任何一國、不得藉保護奥國、取得特殊及獨斷之利益、（按一九三二年七月十五日、英·法·意·捷克、曾簽定議定書、規定由國際上對奥國予以財政上之援助、是年十月十三日、曾經國聯會行政院與以討論）、參院外交委會因此一致以爲奥總理陶爾斐斯卽經呼籲、則聯帶簽字於議定書之各國、卽應從速設法、召集國聯會行政院、以便審查奥國之訴狀、並斷定其是否合理、各國並應採取行政院所可認爲適當之手段云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希特勒表示德與奥亂無關</h3>
<p>奥工人必歸向國社主義</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日郵報駐柏林訪員訪問德國希特勒總理、發表其谈話、據希特勒謂、最近簽字之德波互不侵犯條約、絕無反對蘇聯之作用、又謂前因德國衆院縱火案嫌疑被捕、旋經萊潑齋法院判决無罪之保加利亞共產黨員三人、不久卽可省釋云、述及奥國事變時、則力辨德國國社黨員與最近奥國亂事無關、且謂德國革命無暴動流血之事、與此次奥國擾亂實大有不同、最後則謂奥國工人將來必相率歸向國家社會主義、蓋因奥國政府對於工人採取强暴手段、勢必發生此種反響也云云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奥政府改組法西斯派登台</h3>
<p>社會黨五人上絞台</p>
<p>内閣下令局部解嚴</p>
<p>否認千百婦孺遇難</p>
<p>維也納　昨晚八時二十分、維也納臨時法庭又宣布五人死刑、閲十一分鐘卽送絞人臺執行、但又有社會黨員六人、定夜半執行死刑者、忽在最後數分鐘竟邀赦免、</p>
<p>今晨内閣發出命令一道、除維也納·上奥地利亞·與下奥地利亞·及斯蒂里利四省外、戒嚴令一槪撤銷、</p>
<p>夜間一時半、内閣决定以司徒默博士爲社會福利部長、而原任部長史密資博士則改任維也納行政委員兼不管部閣員、此種變更、甚有關係、因新任社會定利部長乃奥國法西斯化之内衛團所推舉者也、</p>
<p>内閣又决定清除全國各處之社會黨員、故諭令凡係社會黨投資舉定之人員一律免職、此舉將有極大影響、因新接任之官吏或將裁除隸屬社會黨之公務員也、</p>
<p>國外某報所載維也納軍隊砲轟時、有千百婦孺遇害之説、此間官塲指爲謊言宣傳、據謂維也納共死平民一百三十七人、其中僅有婦女九、幼童二、凡無辜遇害者之家屬、政府現正設法撫卹之云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>維也納　奥内閣自昨日下午起開會直至午夜一時始畢、隨卽下令、將台羅爾及柏根蘭兩省卽行解嚴、至維也納·上奥地利亞·下奥地利亞·及斯蒂里四省、亦將於可能時卽予解嚴、内閣並同時局部改組、任司徒默爲社會部長、原任該部部長施密資則改任不管部閣員、内閣又下令取銷社會國會議員之資格、並解散維也納勞工銀行、目下已處絞刑者已有七人、據云、尙有多人將被判决、情報處處長駱德維對外報記者聲稱、叛亂今已敉平云、近今之亂事忽使奥國之保皇黨露其頭角、彼等宣稱、若一九一八年不廢德皇威廉、則無今日之種種事變云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>維也納　政府頃又下令將社會黨團體十二種予以解散、陶爾斐斯總理前曾向社會黨叛徒發表宣言書、謂叛徒若能以軍器交予警署准予赦免、截至目前爲止、叛徒已交出之軍器、計有機關槍七十三架、步槍三、二七六枝、手槍三、七○八枝、步槍子彈二○四、○○○發、機關槍子彈五九、○○○發、及手溜彈多枚、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奥社會黨人事敗逃亡經過</h3>
<p>維也納地下密道通水溝</p>
<p>著名領袖紛紛逃往捷克</p>
<p>維也納　維也納社會黨舉事時顯曾豫備失敗後逃亡之路、否則此次戰事死者必更衆也、今查政府砲毁之工人寓所、均有秘密地道接通維也納地下密如蜂房之水溝、戰敗之黨人可由溝中步行至距戰地較遠之處、安然由洞中升至地面、</p>
<p>據柏拉格路透訪員電稱、奥國社會黨著名領袖鮑爾與德志被迫逃入捷克後、今謀將奥國社會民主黨總部移至白爾諾、同時維也納已組織新執行委員會、事極秘密、蓋如被當局偵覺、委員有處長期徒刑甚至死刑之虞也、奥社會黨逃入捷克者共六十三人、經當局没收其武器送往白爾諾、德志氏曾於二月十三日、卽起事之第二日、作戰受傷、現寓白拉蒂斯拉夫某療養院中、渠雖受傷、但逃入捷克境時、一路步行、歷四小時之久、始達安全地點、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國社會黨對奥政府抗議</h3>
<p>集會時發生流血</p>
<p>（紐約）今日有社會黨員二萬人集於馬迪孫大街公園中開會、反對奥國壓迫社會黨事、忽起衝突、撕碎國旗、示威者隨手拾物、用作戰具、坐椅亂飛、一塲混戰、被毆傷者有女子三、男子九、其中有新聞攝影師二人、有一男子被刺、傷勢頗重、現信受微傷者共約數百人、當共產黨五千人圖佔講演壇時、形勢兇險、達於極點、警察在塲服務者、僅一百七十人、且未携警棍、紐約市長與勞工總會副會長本擬蒞塲演説、但未至而騷亂已作、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>匈牙利京城　匈牙利社會民主黨執行委員會發表宣言、表示與奥國社會黨聯結一致、又衆議員蒲金蓋爾代表衆院社會黨黨團、要求匈牙利政府許奥國社會黨員有在匈國避難之權利（十七哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>西班牙時局</h3>
<p>法西斯派合併</p>
<p>政潮遲早必發</p>
<p>瑪德里　西班牙法西斯派兩團體、因大局不穩、現已合併爲一、並發表共同宣言書、聲明法西斯黨與右翼各黨立塲不同、又臚列黨綱如下、（一）國家統一、（二）直接行動、（三）反對馬克斯主義、（四）反對國會主義、（五）經濟革命、西班牙内閣雖否認閣員内訌之説、但衆覺右翼與左翼之極端派意見歧異太甚、早遲必發生閣潮、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　貝奈瑪耶區域礦工二千人、因休泰地方某礦廠决定增加工作時間、行舉行罷工、以示抗議、又瑪德里碼頭　工被開除五百名、工人因此已於今晨宣佈總罷工、建築業總罷工之工人領袖被捕後、雖已釋放、而罷工則迄未終止、惟一般人頗抱樂觀、以爲罷工工人當可於星期一日一律復工云（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奥亂死傷近千人</h3>
<p>維也納　據官塲估計、此次亂事、全國共死二百三十九人、傷六百五十八人、惟社會黨領袖則稱此不足信、死數遠過於此云、罹難者二百三十九人中、兵士佔一百零二人、平民佔一百三十七人、受傷之六百五十八人中、兵士佔三百十九人、平民佔三百三十九人、（十六日國民電）</p>

<h3>孫殿英軍全力進攻寗夏</h3>
<p>閻允派兵恊攻孫部</p>
<p>孫部精華損失殆盡</p>
<p>北平通信、寗夏戰局、目下尙無開展、分紀情况如次、</p>
<p>孫軍策略孫殿英現已由寳豐返石咀子、仍稱兵西進、率部圍攻寗夏省城、但因懼飛機轟炸、乃晝伏夜動、而寗夏軍則防禦極嚴、孫軍不易得逞、刻孫以勢窮力蹙、且糧食缺乏、故在石咀子召集部下將領、商議戰略、當經决定再以全力對寗垣作最後之猛攻、如佔據寗夏、則平羅不攻自破、惟食糧卽缺乏、須在最短期内完成此項計劃、否則士兵將有潰散之虞、因此又决定第二步辦法、若進攻寗夏城郊不順利時、則率全軍繞道向固原凉州竄進、以謀出路、此爲連日孫軍二度猛攻寗夏省城之原因也、</p>
<p>五省圍勦關於五省圍勦孫軍辦法、軍分會雖令晉綏甘寗青等省凖備、但實際上尙未執行、其癥結仍在晉方之是否實行出兵圍勦、現閻已電平軍分會、謂已飭令晉綏兩省軍隊於本月二十日向五臨一帶集中、并委徐永昌·傅作義·爲全權代表、卽將赴平磋商、十四日傅作義已電軍分會報告、卽赴河邊村謁閻請示、軍分會以軍隊出動、貴乎神速、當急電徐傅速來北平、籌商一切、旋得覆電、凖於十五日午同車離并、聞閻已允由晉綏兩省調出三師一獨立旅兵力、圍勦孫部、計趙承綏騎兵師、王靖國傅作義兩步兵師、豐玉璽一獨立旅、並限於本月二十日在綏西五臨一帶集中、一俟徐傅到平、與軍分會議定具體辦法後、各路軍隊、卽由綏西出動、至徐傅到平後、係磋商如何提早出兵、及出兵後追剿孫軍至如何程度等事、故徐此次來平所負使命、甚爲重大也、</p>
<p>北平軍分會對於五省圍剿孫部、不再下討伐令、駐防平郊之關師全部、及劉師騎兵一團、砲兵一團、亦將奉令開赴包頭、現關劉兩師、已下凖備動員令、兵士皮衣已製就、車輛亦經備妥、將於日内先開往一部、</p>

<h3>孔祥榕詳復視察堵口工程</h3>
<p>運輸困難有停工待料之虞</p>
<p>河性善變須人工物料凑手</p>
<p>派視察員劉秉忠常川駐工</p>
<p>國府黄河水災救濟委員會委員長孔祥煕、對於黄河堵口工程、以及修築兩岸禦水堤防、極爲重視、前派該會委員兼總視察孔祥榕、親往馮樓工次、實地察勘堵口情形、據聞該决口處因蹙凌小漲、所作堵築工程、其排椿曾被冲毁、現正設法補救、時届凌汛、冰塊下注、至堪注意、孔委員長爲預防起見、已將該總視察之報告、批交該會工賑組具復、一面派視察員劉秉忠常川駐工、隨時考察、以防不虞、茲將孔總視察報告原文、披露於後、</p>
<p>爲遵再呈報工程詳細情形、祈鑒核事、竊祥榕奉派赴豫魯冀各省商洽黄河决口堵築工程籌欵辦法、並視察馮樓决口處堵口工程進行情况、業經分别報告在案、復奉面諭、另將該處工程詳細具報等因、查工賑組原定辦法、係於入字壩已做柳排工程之水中孤立橲樹處、作爲一端之起點、另由對岸村坡爲又一端之起點、同時兩端用柳枝編排、壓石沉下、逐漸加高、依次進展、並於水中簽椿兩行、以禦工作、聞原擬儲備石料八千方、以供需用、計已運到一千六百方、（詢據齊工程師報告）除用去　外、現僅存六百餘方、（詢據宋總工程師報告）刻正進行舖墊鐵軌、凖備運輸、但因火車不敷支配、船隻亦感困難、水路正値冰凍、陸路亦多串溝、交通不便、能否不致</p>
<p>停待料工　是一問題、此應注意者一、又查所簽木椿計三十四根、（詢據齊工程師報告）榕到工之前一日、大溜最深處之木椿、被蹙凌冰塊冲毁八根、適當工程重要之處、致使兩端工程、不能啣接、於進行殊多妨礙、刻正在設法補救中、聞將用春捲辦法、（以柳枝捲石塊、或捲麻袋土沉下、）但</p>
<p>水流湍激　且在流深之處、能否抵禦流勢、實施堵築是一問題、此應注意者二、再查黄河浮沙過深、水性猛烈、不宜長椿、聞前周撫治該河時、曾調椿手行打長椿、結果失敗、現在利用簽椿、能否有效、是一問題、此應注意者三、復查黄河凌汛、轉瞬卽至、冰泮塊下注、水位抬高、兩者均與堵口工程有極大妨害、凌汛前能否堵築完工是一問題、卽使堵築完竣、能否抵禦不至冲壞、致又軍水、以及尙未竣工、而</p>
<p>凌汛𨺗至　有無相當凖備、不使已做�</p>
<p>工程冲毁、歸於失敗、是又一大問題、此應注意者四、更查此項堵口工程、如能進行順利、依期堵築完竣、凌汛不生變故、亦應注意、</p>
<p>桃汛伏汛　高水位時、能否防守、　此地工程爲石頭莊水口門一帶堤工之一道最要防線、此處不守、則堵築新工、在在堪虞、究應如何防守、以臻完善、是又一問題、此應注意者五、此外該工程處所挑第一引河、距離口門太近、已被淤塡、其第二引河水流、時而過、時而淤、</p>
<p>暢阻無定　適榕處視察員劉秉忠留汴視察\乃由宋總工程師、約同前往决口處、察勘水勢現狀、當見該工程處原指定之第三引河、不當溜勢、遂由宋總工程師面約該員、親往第二第三引河間擇定地點、簽訂引河中心椿、交由李工程師測量興工、作爲第三引河、至一月十八日夜、卽被河溜冲開引河頭、暢流而入故道、减輕第三次口處、水量不少、現仍當溜勢、其原定之第三引河、現改爲第四引河、正</p>
<p>在挑挖中　留備洪水時洩水之用、惟爲保持現在引河流量、增加深度、而不使兩坡有多坍之處、似應注意二三引河對岸之柳壩、母使過於前進、致引河坡度灘潰、河流散漫、反被淤塞、此應注意者六、總之堵口工程、關於水勢人工物料三者、均有同時連帶關係、昨已呈明在案、蓋因黄河水性善變、如遇水勢合宜、人工物料均能凑手、則晝夜趕築、自收一氣呵成之效、故主其事者、每於此而三致意焉、所有遵諭詳報視察堵口工程、理合據情呈請鑒核、</p>

<h3>摩登性寒腿病</h3>
<p>（二）翟·紹·衡·</p>
<p>寒腿的預防法　我們旣經知道寒腿這病症是腿上受寒而起的、那末牠預降的方法、祇要不讓腿受寒、暖暖的保護牠就行了、至於什麽好看不好看、摩登不摩登、當然是不能管的了、但是只要大家都這樣打扮的時候、也就没有什麽不好看、現在我想先把我想得到的幾椿事情來説一説、</p>
<p>（一）出門的時候、鞋襪要厚鞋底最好用毡呢、可以防止冷氣竄入脚心、褲脚要長、最好在大脚裏面裝一段鬆緊的小脚管、免得冰冷的西北風、往褲脚裏直鑽、照現在一般的裝束、頭上戴了絨帽、身上披了皮衣、下身穿的紡綢短褲、脚上穿的薄絲襪皮凉鞋、汽車出進的、倒還好受、那些坐洋車的、任憑一陣陣的西北風、儘往脚上吹、褲裏鑽、就是那手拳大的熱水皮袋、恐怕也抵不住這無情的寒氣、</p>
<p>（二）上課的時候校舍講究、經費充足的學校、當然地板洋灰地为爐水汀、弄得很舒販、但是在一般窮對付的學校、門窗是關而透風的、火爐是有爐無火的、脚底下是潮濕不堪底泥磚的、要在這種地方、每日裏從早上八點鐘坐到下午五點鐘、一冬二冬三冬的過去、恐怕結是果、必定要養成許多的寒腿病的、所以在窮學校裏讀書的人、應該要作出門坐在露天的凖備、庶幾手可以减少腿上受寒的害處、</p>
<p>（三）打牌的時候、在闊人家固然没有什麽問題、在普通人家、尤其在潮濕不堪的泥磚上、戰桌下終要放幾個小板橙、作爲牌手的擱脚用、如若不然、那末十六圈二十四圈連天接夜的打下去、等到過了半夜、快到天亮的時候、都要覺得手麻脚冷、腰癱背直了、這樣一天兩天、雖是不成多大問題、要是經年累月、那就必成寒腿病了、</p>
<p>（四）聽戲和看電影的時候、在講究的戲園、當然不成問題、况且時髦的少奶奶小姐們、聽戲也不過聽最後的一二齣、時間不長、受害還少、然而那些從跳加官起要看到老旦做親的戲迷、下身就不能不特别的多穿、因爲聽戲也是坐定了不動的、并且戲園子的設備、到底完全的少、要是坐在風口的地方、時間久了、也是不行的、還有我最近得到一種經騐、也是値得注意的、就是民國二十二年的夏天、我偶然同家屬到某大戲園去看電影、不用我説某大戲園是大家知道的一個講究戲園、坐在裏面、是可以忘記是夏天的、這是因爲裏面有冷氣設備的緣故、那知道没有享受這種清福的我、坐到没有半個鐘頭、就覺得脚底下冷氣傳達到腰裏、於是腰也痛了、肚子也痛了、因爲不願意打散同件的高興、就勉强支持到完塲、然而苦痛極了、後來又去過一次、又是得到同樣的結果、所以我就下了不再涉足的决心、又講給人家一聽、到是和我同病的人很多、我想有同病的人們和經期產後的女子、至少應該加以注意、（未完）</p>
<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論時下的文字</h3>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>關於你的自學經騐、我們非常的認爲珍貴。你的學習文字。收集辭彙都是用的正確的方法。（　得好的辭句，就藏起來），（一年多）了（報紙　碎片積得不少），再（把合心意的文字）</p>
<p>，（剪下來貼在簿子上），自然，在你的環境下，如你這般的精心，能做去，已够難能了。</p>
<p>至於你不明瞭現代文字，這難怪你，你的環境實在不能使你有多接近（文字）的機會罷不過，關於這點，我們覺得並不爲你可惜，因爲做人並不一定要會舞文弄墨。文字技巧很好的人，不明世事的也正多而又多。我想，爭取文字上的成功，簡直是不必要的；但是如果爲了了解（現實）而學習現代中國語文，那支頗是一件有意義而且必要的事。</p>
<p>現代中國語文無疑的有你所説的（的有文言中加上（了）（的）（嗎）；而白話文有時又插入文言的詞句。）在原則上説，這都不能説壞。中國語文現方處在改造的時代，它需要擴大新辭彙，所以白話文中夾有文言的詞句，只要是活的引用，也原無不可的。至於文言内加入白話，這是證明文言的没落，它要維持舊的體裁，舊的辭句，是决不能存在和流行的了。但是，在目下各類文字中，純粹優美的白話文已經不少，白話文字在中國早已牢固的成立了。</p>
<p>（白話體每句好像都要打頓，甚至於每個字都格格不得下。）這恐怕是因爲你受文言的影響太深了，對白話還不十分親近罷，不然，就是你所看的確是最惡劣的作品。</p>
<p>現在白話中，有兩類文字是比較的難讀。第一類中又分二種：一種是意在言外的或所謂（幽默）的文安，（如林語堂，魯迅等作品）一種是刻畫盡致的描寫文；（如徐志摩等作品）另一類則爲翻譯文字。</p>
<p>前者的（難）不僅在文字上，同時也在你的感情是否能體會到一件藝術品中所含的崇高的情緒，是否或以引起共鳴？後者，還要加上你的學力，對於某一種作品中所包含的内容你是否完全未曾相識？抑或有些根底？所以你不能因理論不懂反錯認是文字不懂啊！不過，我們也很知道現在譯文中確是有好些文字上的（不通），（生硬），（太歐化）的弊病，這一半是因譯者能力太低，一半是由於中國文字本身的缺憾。總之，這是一時的現象，在將來文字改造時間終結之後是可以免除的。我們不能因爲有子幾篇難讀的譯文，卽起而反對（外來辭句），（外來風格），（精密長句的構造法）啊！</p>
<p>（究竟那一種是標凖），却不能確定。但在初學的人還是先從純白話入乎爲宜，如果一定要指出一種（典型）來，我想，郭沫若的散文是白話中最暢達的一種，你可隨便找他一本散文集來看看罷！</p>
<p>你附寄來的一篇文字，是一篇寫得頗清淡的小品，這類文字現在多而又多，你可到我們的圖書目錄上（小品文）（近代文集）書去找，包管能满足的興趣。</p>
<p>最後，特别要提醒你的是：你不必想在文字上求成功，你應把學習現代文作爲研究其他學科的手段。（請參看本欄二月七八日登　的論學習語文一。）</p>

<h3>天津亦敗香港</h3>
<p>盛勢下竟受打撃　香港二次敗挫、不受困於四面楚歌之中、而失乎在氣旺勢盛之下、昨日津港一役、尤爲顯著、當其兩軍作戰之際、香港前鋒足跡、登堂入室、各顯身手、頻加射撃、顧天津防守森嚴、志難得逞、乃一而再、再而三、光顧雖勤、要害不中、終亦無補於大局、津軍則在努力對抗之下、偶然反顧、前鋒屢能蹈空而入、一鼓而下、蓋全賴運用得當、不在攻撃次數多寡之間耳、</p>
<p>津中堅保持勝利　天冿守門昨日之表演、甚爲满意、挽回險球、不計其數、中堅黑爾、銅頭與鐵腿齊佳、二次賴頭救險、驚倒四座、左右輔佐、不見得力、於是大受敵軍壓迫、久久不去、幸而内衛較前頑强、漏洞難覓、多事之秋、卒至無恙、賴其力也、五鋒犀利、瓊斯功績在傑漢遜之上、兩翼被人監視、仍能活動如故、</p>
<p>港守門破壤大局　香港五鋒個個活躍非凡、左翼何嘉特更精彩過人、長派短傳、莫不佳妙、射門凖而且急、爲五鋒冠、港隊最危險之人物、左内列特厘内外兼及、與左翼呼應一氣、聯　入攻、津隊每爲之失色、右部小告山奴、亦縱横如故、大告山奴與譚江柏敏捷依然、惟缺乏最後之一撃、以致功敗垂成、徒呼奈何、中衛線三人應付裕如、左右内衛、處位過前、每逢迅速無比之津鋒突入、輒返身不及、守門顯呈軟弱、一再告陷、渠當負其半數以上之責任也、</p>
<p>十分鐘各中一球　裁判樂秀榮鳴笛宣戰、香港開球進展、三四往返、譚江柏帶球入陣、斜傳中央、津右内衛不及兼顧、大告山奴見機立斷、猛然射出、正中龍門、香港勝得此球、爲時僅五分鐘耳、指顧之間、天津瓊斯飛馬冲入、舉足向左、中鋒羅傑跨出人前、毫不思慮、加上一脚、十分鐘内、造成各一和局、香港左翼、何嘉特在嚴密監視下、活動如故、一球遥送左方、小告出奴迎得還脚攻門、津守門身乎矯捷、俯身捉住、譚江柏大告山奴一再進撲、均爲撲得、</p>
<p>前鋒得勢後防空　香港右翼小告山奴邊陲躍入、全綫隨進、成一字陣、包圍津門、津隊乃密佈重兵、四守要隘、斯時港隊氣燄之盛、無以復加、中衛綫亦調入前方、加重攻撃力量、内衛移至中央綫上、遥爲接應、不料盛勢之下、奇禍突降、天津右翼芬傑瑞士迎送合度、中鋒羅傑挾之疾進、側傳瓊斯、左右無人、瓊斯從容射入、以二對一佔先、香港辛萬苦、一無成就、不如天津三傳四遞、隨乎卽得、是亦幸不幸之别耳</p>
<p>偶然光顧又告捷　香港小告山奴横挑門前、列特厘迎之以頭、津守門向後托出、小告山奴開角球殊佳、由中堅黑爾倒地頂出、險象立解、天津乘此反攻、左翼阿却爾送交右翼、右翼打中門柱、彈至瓊斯胸前、迎門射去、又告成功、天津乃以三對一佔先、小告山奴心雄萬夫、直取津門、守門輕向上托、風浪頓靜、香港繼續問津、無往而不遭閉門羹、最後一次、譚江柏已避過黑爾、不料射去、正中守門懹内、上半時天津三對一領前、</p>
<p>天津香港兩隊合影　（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>困苦艱難獲一球　下半塲開始未久、何嘉特無人窺入、從容挑中、津門四週、重兵防守、港隊中部三將、恍如徬徨岐途、無所適從、竟至進攻路綫、悉被截斷、列特厘暗中突出、去球又被守門接得、進攻猛烈可畏、防衛嚴密、尤爲驚人、香港何嘉物幾爲每次進攻之領導者、當二十五分鐘時、挑落門前、小告山奴躍出人羣、仰前一頂、落入網窩、比數乃成二對三、</p>
<p>進撲猛烈反遭禍　香港以所負僅一球、益加奮勉、冀自失敗中、求得勝利、進撲之勇、較前尤烈、但其不幸事件、亦繼續發現、大告山奴兩度頭上受衝、尙能勉强作戰、譚江柏腿部獲傷、終至扶傷出塲、香港在二對三之後、鐵騎又遍野而來、小告山奴挑中、譚江柏失於延緩、津隊得從容佈防、安然渡去、瓊斯卽時輕騎疾入、球自右向左推進、中鋒羅傑躍起一頂、飛入雲霄、時間將終、香港進攻甚急、左部表演尤佳、挑中之球、源源不絕、曾有二次峻急之射撃、發演於津門十五碼之前、咸由黑爾以光頭擋出、形勢突變、津隊傑漢生孤軍深入、港守門親自抵禦、羅傑繼進、又打入門内、結果天津四對二勝香港、</p>

<h3>爲什麽要讀書</h3>
<p>— 南邨</p>
<p>小朋友，你爲什麽要讀書呢？這是値得研究的，自已試想想看，究竟是爲什麽一回事呢？</p>
<p>人無論做什麽，都有一種目的：和一種希望，照了目的和希望，向前進行，漸漸地纔達到圓满結果·讀書的目的和希望是什麽呢？</p>
<p>我國（大儒）王陽明先生，他在當小學生時候，已經把這問題確切的説過了，我告訴出來，請注意一下。</p>
<p>王陽明當年齡很少的時候，在學塾讀書，他問那敎他的先生爲什麽要讀書？先生答，讀了書就可以取功名富貴，王陽明説，不是這樣，爲的是學（做人）方法。先生大爲贊賞，後來王陽明成爲大儒，他在年幼就有這種卓見，眞是難得。</p>
<p>日本國家富强，是得力於王陽明學説（良知）與（知行合一）上來的，並且是日本人自已承認的，王陽明是我們中國從前的賢人，我們中國不知道研究他的學説，照着去做，反被日本人學去，不是奇談嗎？書局内兒童書類有（王陽明）一書，可以買本看看，就知道槪略，至於陽明所著的全集，現在你們還看不明瞭，也看不了許多，待將來程度增進時，再研究吧！</p>
<p>至於如何做人的方法，讀過的書上所説的，都是敎你照着去做的，如果是自已平常做的事，覺得很不好的，與書上是不對的，就要改過來，這纔呌（讀書致用）。</p>
<h3>開學的那天</h3>
<p>— 梨</p>
<p>今天我們的學校開學了，早晨，我很早就起身，吃完了早飯後，馬上揹着書，就上學校去，一路上，碰到了許多老同學，於是，我們就跑成了一個大隊，大家同着學校走去，這時候，心上有許多説不出的快樂之處。</p>
<p>我們走進了學校之後，又看到了許多同學，他們笑着，呌着，跳着，大家身上穿着新衣服，快活得很。</p>
<p>後來，那鈴兒叮叮噹　地呌羊，意思是要舉行開學禮了，於是我們全體同學，好像那浪頭一般地湧進了那大禮堂裏去。</p>
<p>各種儀式做過了後，接着，我們的校長先生上台演講了，聽來，他的聲音裏，總是帶着笑，我站起脚尖兒來，看過去，看見他的嘴兒在慢慢地動。</p>
<p>校長行先生演講的是（呌我們做個好學生，要用功讀書，不要逃學，要敬愛先生，同學之間，要像自家兄弟一般的和氣親愛；）還有許許多多話，我此刻一時記不起來了。</p>
<p>另外，環有幾位先生也上台演講的，他們好似也快活得很，總是满面孔的笑容，眼睛一䀹一䀹向我們看過來。�</p>
<p>今天學校裏充满着新氣象，今天是開學了，今天是許多先生最快活的日子，也是許多同學最快活的日子，也是我最快活的日子！</p>
<p>今天，我的媽媽也請起客來了，給我許多餅干和糖菓，今天好似也是她的最快活的日子。</p>
<h3>爸爸有</h3>
<p>— 醉竹</p>
<p>和珍放學回來，丢下書包，一蹤一跳的奔到爸爸那裏，討了十個銅板，帶着皮球到門口去頑。</p>
<p>遠遠看見弄堂口，皮匠家的阿三，和拾香烟頭阿二，手牽手，笑嘻嘻的走來。和珍别轉了頭，把小嘴一披。心想；這兩個窮孩子，眞討厭。不識相的阿三，偏在他痛後喊道：</p>
<p>（噲！和珍，你有銅板嗎？）阿二和阿三，今天把拾來的香烟頭，賣得了十個銅板，特地走來，希罕給和珍看。</p>
<p>（有丨我有十個！）和珍突然阂轉了身子，伸出了小手，很驕傲的回答。</p>
<p>（我也有十個）阿二和阿三也一齊伸出了黑遥，得意的喊！</p>
<p>（你們兩人，才有十個：我一人就有了十個。而且我爸爸還有，你們有爸爸有嗎？）和珍氣呼呼的，要勝過這兩個窮孩子。</p>
<p>阿二輕輕一笑道：（你靠爸爸，我靠手，爸爸不給你没有）；</p>
<p>阿三也和着笑道（爸爸有時不如手，有手賺錢最長久。）</p>
<p>兩人像唱着得勝歌似的，拍着手，笑着，唱着，走了。臨走時，還扮了一個鬼臉，羞和珍。</p>
<p>和珍這時，只氣得喃喃呐呐的自咕嚕着（爸爸有！爸爸有。）</p>
<h3>表的構造</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>智兒是一個天資聰敏而又活潑的孩子，所以這秋季的半學期中，用功讀書，學校裏寄來的成績報告單，當然不會不進步的，并且在他的一級中高列第一名。師長稱讚他，父母愛護他。</p>
<p>他的父母親很快樂的買了一隻錶給他，作爲用功讀書的獎品。</p>
<p>智兒很歡喜他那隻亮晶晶的掛錶，時時對着它呆看，覺得錶面上的針會移動，同時又聽得滴嗒滴嗒的聲音，眞是奇妙異常。</p>
<p>他又好奇起來，便很驚奇的問着他的哥哥丨丨慧兒丨丨：（哥哥，你瞧！這三隻針怎麽會移動的？你聽！爲什麽有滴嗒滴嗒的聲音？哥哥，你能回答我麽？）</p>
<p>慧兒想了一想，回答他説：（弟弟！這三隻針，最長的針，呌分針：短的針，呌時針：最短的針，呌秒針。錶的裏面有齒輪·簧條·游絲。游絲每次擺動，有一定的時間，呌擺的等時性。每擺動一次，算做一秒。擺動的時候，使齒輪旋轉，牽動時針和分針，表示時刻。簧條利用鋼鐵的彈力，使游絲擺動不息。齒輪周圍的齒，和别一個齒輪的齒，互相銜接。倘使一個齒輪旋轉，别的齒輪也都旋轉了。這滴嗒滴嗒的聲音，是游絲在擺動時所發的。你要使你的錶，永久不壞，有二種方法：一·不可時時開放錶門，防塵垢侵入，那齒輪便要漸漸的停滯了。二·你旋緊簧條，也要在一定的時候。）</p>
<p>智兒使很快樂的藏好了錶，到外邊去遊玩了。</p>
<h3>獵人與樵夫</h3>
<p>— 銀獵</p>
<p>有一個獵人在山林中探尋獅子的足跡，碰着了一個樵夫，就問他有没有看見獅子的足跡，知道不知道獅子躱在那裏。這個樵夫説道：丨丨</p>
<p>（嚎，我能彀把活的獅子指給你看。）這個獵人聽了，嚇得面孔發白，牙齒打戰，他説道：丨丨</p>
<p>象的畫法　兩個蛋形　和一條尾巴　四條腿和一只耳　再加些　原來是你！</p>
<p>（我只要看看獅子的足跡；我並不要看活的獅子啊。）</p>
<p>世界上只會説話勇敢，而做事不勇敢的人，眞多着呢，小朋友！你們還是要做一個勇於做事而懦於説話的人，還是要做一個勇於説話而懦於做事的人呢？</p>
<h3>兒笑話</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>臉皮最厚</p>
<p>兄弟弟：你曉得人的身體上，那一部份的皮膚最厚？</p>
<p>弟　我想恐怕是臉皮吧。</p>
<p>兄　何以見得？</p>
<p>弟　你看這冷的天氣，大家身上都穿棉衣·皮衣·戴手套·着棉鞋·獨有臉上一點也不着東西，豈不是臉皮最厚呀。</p>
<p>一目瞭然</p>
<p>姊　妹妹：你爲何讀書老是閉着一隻眼睛？</p>
<p>妹　我因爲聽人家説：（一目了然），若張開兩隻眼睛，皮看不清楚了。</p>
<p>不要告訴他</p>
<p>路人　你們兩個人，那個是兄？那個是弟？</p>
<p>玲兒　哥哥：你不要告訴他。</p>
<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>包書紙</p>
<p>小朋友：你們讀的（書），時常放在檯板上，（書面），不是很容易骯髒嗎？（書面）好比我們自已可愛的（面孔），假使我們的（面孔）一骯髒，不是很難看的，所以你們在開學的時候，一領到（新書），趕快用（包書紙）把它包好；這樣一來，平時檯上和手上的墨漬，𪘣齪，就可以染不到（書面）上；因爲（書面）外面，還有一層（包書紙。）等到放了假（書）已經讀完了，將要把（書）藏好的時候，你再把（包書紙）取去：小朋友：這本（書）的（書面），不時仍舊很新的嗎？</p>

<p>小朋友：你們可愛的（書），它的（角）時常捲起嗎？如果有這種情形，你們爲避免（書角捲）起見，積極的：丨在（書角）没有捲以前·丨讀（書）的時候，不用手伏在（書）上，和不用手時常翻覆，讀過後把（書）放在（書夾裏，消極的：丨在（書角）捲了以後丨第一·先把已捲（書角）照原樣理平，夾在（書夾）裏，用重物壓平：第二，要矯正使（書角捲）的惡習。</p>
<h3>冷漲熱縮</h3>
<p>— 芷園</p>
<p>張兒聽見先生講，凡是一切物體，遇熱則漲，遇冷則縮，他並看見先生試騐時候，用一個小銅球，有鏈子緊着，放在一個小銅架子上，這球可以由架子孔裏拿着上下走動的。後來將球在酒精燈上燒些時間，再放在架子上，球便穩穩的架着　先生説：這是遇熱則漲，球的面積，經　燃燒加熱，就漲大了，所以能架得住。後來過子廿分鐘，球又落下來，先生説：（這是遇冷則縮，球雖加熱漲大，熱散了後，仍縮回原狀，所以又落下來。）張兒對於熱漲冷縮觀念，是很明瞭的。</p>
<p>一天正在寒冬極冷時候，他喝茶的一隻玻璃杯，當早起時，看見因裏面满杯，茶於夜間結冰，將杯进破了，他父親説：（水結冰時，容積增大，所以进破，是你在夜間，不曾將裏面的茶傾去的緣故）。張兒説（遇熱則漲，這不是例外遇冷么漲嗎？）</p>
<p>喫飯時候，張見用筷子挑着一大塊魚湯的凍子，放在火鍋裏去，停了一息，在火鍋裏尋來尋去，説（是那個將我所燙的魚凍子喫了？）他的父親説：（呆孩子，魚凍子經過一燙，不化成湯嗎？那裏還有呢？張兒説：那知這又有例外的遇熱則縮，竟縮到没有的地位了！</p>
<h3>化學游戲</h3>
<p>— 德齡</p>
<p>玻棒點火</p>
<p>景惠對雪玫道：學校裏快要開同樂會了！我們預備做節什麽表演呢？雪玫思索了一下説：我這裏有個空　水瓶，還有一個大銅錢：我再向母親那邊去討些紗線，倒瓶酒精，做盞自製的酒精燈。請你到錢先生那邊去，借根玻璃棒，討些　酸　和濃硫酸來。過了一會，景惠和雪玫都把所要的東西拿到了：於是雪玫先生玻璃棒上蘸了點硫酸，再蘸上點　酸鋰，然後將玻璃棒頭向酒精燈芯上一觸，酒精燈便點着了。景惠笑道：好！我們就做這個試騐吧！</p>
<p>用水取火</p>
<p>兆麟是一位品學兼優的學生。她在舉行畢業式的那天，到化學室裏，向敎自然的先生，討了一小塊，放在洋油　保存好：伊又預備了一隻小面盆，一節玻璃管，幾張很乾的講義纸和一杯熱水。在行過儀式，到餘興的時候：伊就當衆把紙撕碎，並將油洋澆在紙上，　藏到紙下，放在小盆内：然後用玻璃管吸點熱水，滴在鈉上，則鈉和水化合成功　氧化鈉，並放出很高的熱度，使鈉燃着，因而紙也燒起來了。而看的人，都莫明其妙</p>
<p>自來火</p>
<p>文淑拿了隻空墨水瓶，倒些二硫化炭在裏面；又在水中切了些黄燐，放入二硫化炭裏，則黄燐漸漸溶解，成功了二硫化炭和黄燐的溶液。一天，學期考試完畢了，級内舉行話别會的時候，文淑就把這溶液，倒了些在紙上，放在一個鐵製的三脚架上；不多一刻，紙上發白烟了，轟！紙上燒起來了。同學們大家很是詫異，不知文淑用的什麽藥水，祇是拍手不止。</p>
<p>化學取火</p>
<p>淑明在兒童理科叢書的第一册火柴篇裏，看到三百年前發明的，用化學方法取火的方法後；伊於是買了一些白糖，又設法弄到些氧酸鋰和硫酸　伊先把分量相等的糖唾氧酸鉀，用心混合起來；然後取一些放在有鐵絲網的鐵架上，或磚石上；用玻璃棒等滴點硫酸在那混合物上，就立刻發出很亮火燄血燒起來了。淑明很是快活，但不知糖是炭水化合物，　酸鉀裏含的氧氧很多，硫酸能吸收糖裏的水分，並使其發熱，因而燒起來的理由。</p>
<p>冰上點火</p>
<p>祿貞的父親，是個前清的老秀才，喜歡吃水烟。前幾天的朔氧，已將西伯利亞的寒流，吹來南國：外面的水，已經硬化，結成了水晶般的冰塊。祿貞希望伊父親，明白現在科學的進步，相信科學萬能，並討伊父親快樂起見；暗暗的把兩粒小鉀條，裏在水烟媒頭上，又從外面敲了一塊冰，帶着天眞的笑容，圓的面孔，對伊父親説爹爹！我在冰上取火給您吃水烟啊！説着就把烟媒頭上的鉀條，觸到冰塊面上：因鉀與水起了化學作用，發出火來，烟媒就此燃着了。</p>

<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>電報與道路（上）</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>收發報人須知</p>
<p>電報之傳遞，與道路並無關係，而本篇標題，定爲（電報與道路），讀者或疑電報涉及築路，或與公路航路鐵路汽車、交互爲用，此實不然；蓋電報所經行，可稱爲電路，無論其爲有綫，無綫，電路通斯電報可達，電路之路，與道路之路，同一路也，但實際上並不能混爲一談。</p>
<p>我人苟置身通　大道之間，覩車輛往來，前後相接，又見春或東或西，有崗警指揮，有號燈指示，各趨其所欲達之目的地，而秩序井然，無有或紊。冥思默想，舉一反三，則電報交通，固與道路交通，覺無歧異。明乎道路情形，用以推察電報，思過半矣，所以（電報與道路），非電報有賴乎道路，實電報之收發及經行，可舉道路之情形爲比喻。電報乎？道路乎？我可斷言，覘於道路，卽可以知電報。</p>
<p>在收發報人，欲明電報傳遞之實在情形，應先知電報經行之直達綫路。所謂直達綫路者，卽自某處至某處，可以直接拍發，無煩中間之局，爲其轉遞。譬如上海至南京，至天津，至漢口，至福州等處，均直達聯絡，一發卽到：故上海發往以上各地之電報，雖就地圖上觀察，相隔頗遠，然每次電報，由發報人以達收報人，所耗時間，不過數分鐘耳。此種情形，與專用汽車，載客自某處逕抵某處，中途絕未停留者，事屬一例。</p>
<p>依據我人乘車之經騐，京滬火車，先抵無錫，後達南京。以彼例此，似若發往無錫之電報，應較發往南京者到達爲速。實際上此層理想，亦有未合，斯因電報傳遞，有直達與非直達之分，故滬錫電報，所取電路，率由滬而鎭，而錫，中間有鎭江局之接轉，結果不能比滬鎭或京滬之電報爲快。此猶坐車往某處，並無直接到達之站，往往須在附近下車，作一折回，觀乎路站之所由分，正不啻電路之有規定也。（或者疑，何以綫路不能處處開放直達？此則屬於業務上問題，業務繁忙者，以直達爲有利益。業務清减，則直達綫路，永久佔用，頗不經濟。）</p>
<h3>記賬發電保證辦法之利益</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>三月一日起實行</p>
<p>查電報局及無線電台，前爲各商行發電便利計，嘗准其將每月所發報費之約數，預存於局台，月終結賬，多退少補，所謂（預存報費）是也。但此種辦法，局台各自爲政，迄無定規，卽不將存欵本息呈報交通部，致部中無法稽查：又不將存欵利息，算给商行，至商行坐受損失，甚至去年所存之欵，今年仍未結清者丨或局台前任所收之欵，已經携去，而後任因無案可稽，據理否認者。積習相承，蓋非一日，商行與局台，皆受其害焉。今電政當局洞燭此弊，特制定記賬發電保證辦法十一條，已飭各局台於三月一日起實行，茲將條文之要點，及雙方之利益，縷述如左：</p>
<p>（一）關於商行方面者：</p>
<p>一、夫商行發電之目的，在求電報能迅速傳至其目的地，而有利於商務也。然欲達到此目的，須有一個前提，卽收報手續須十分簡單是也。故預存報費之原則，實可採用，今爲愼重電欵起見，特規定凡聲請發寄記賬發電之商行，應按每月所發報費之約數，以現欵交局台存入銀行，作爲報費保證金，該項保證金數目，固定不動，記賬報費按月照付，不在保證金内扣付，以免滾存計算之煩。則商行不但得記賬發電之便，並有查核存欵之權，此係記賬發電保證辦法與預存報費根本不同之點。其利一也。</p>
<p>二、按辦法第三條之規定：（保證金卽存入銀行，非有下列情形之一者·局台不得提取：（甲）商行結欠報費未能照付，由局台提取報費時；（乙）商行停止發電，由局台提欵撥付時；（丙）商行發電减少，由局台提欵發還保證金之一部份時。一有如此之明白規定，不肖經手人員雖欲染指此欵，殊不可能，則商行不虞保證金之擅取，而局台不患報費之無着，互相保證，互相信賴，其利二也。</p>
<p>三、保證金利息，每半年銀行結算後，由局台撥付存欵之商行，則商行存欵利息，决不受損。其利三也。</p>
<p>四、辦法第八條：（商行如因發電减少時，得請求局台提還保證金之一部份。）則保證金雖存銀行，苟商行不需要多發電報時，仍得請求提還保證金之一部份，殊不若從前之預存報費，雖於取出，其利四也。</p>
<p>五、辦法第九條有（保證金得以局台指定銀行之擔保函件代替一之規定，更爲便利。蓋各地商行之發電者，以金融機關爲最多，否則亦與金融機關有相當關係者。今保證金得由局台指定銀行之擔保函件代替，是商行僅以得該銀行一函，卽可取得記賬發電資格，何樂而不爲耶？</p>
<p>（二）關於局台方面者：</p>
<p>一、收報手續簡單電報送入局台之收發處，收報員必須記算字數，記算報費，開具收據，找付欵項等手續，至少需要三分鐘之時間，然後送入報房。若有十位發報人，同時到局發電，則最後一電，須要三十分鐘之遲延矣，今若採用記賬發電辦法，則收報員僅須在發電簿上簽字已足，其餘手續。俟電報傳遞後再辦，則電報之速率，必增加不少。</p>
<p>二、報費不致虚空保證金存入銀行後，卽非具有前列，甲、乙、丙、三種情刑之一者，局台不得提取，則主管人員，雖欲活動一時，且不可得，故將存欵充入私囊之勾當，决爲事實上所辦不到。又結算報費與抵扣保證金之手續，及報費超過保證金之追繳，又絰辦法第六第七兩條分别嚴密之規定，則報費决無空虚之虞矣。</p>
<p>夫存欵發電，本在便利商民，若無一定辦法，則貪污之徒，視爲生利之藪，不獨有損局臺信譽，抑且病商營私，有干禁律。今得電政當局規定一種記賬發電保證辦法，一掃以前相承之惡習，誠快舉也。各商行若赴局臺試之，當知我言之不欺矣。</p>
<h3>分道式自動話機之槪况</h3>
<p>— 錦</p>
<p>愛德温斯話局所裝用</p>
<p>英國愛德温斯（Advance）電話局於一九三三年二月二十三日開局，由前郵政部長愛得理君行開幕禮，此爲世界電話界初次採用分道式（Bypath）之自動電話機。其全部機件，除電力部份外，均由標凖電話纜公司（Stsndard　Telephones　and　Cables　Ltd)，此式經曾參加歐戰之前皇家通信隊工程師，在師公司之亨敦試騐所繼續研究七年，方成該局之裝設。此種自動電話，純係出於該公司之請求，郵政部不受任何拘束，惟爲試騐起見，故允於兩年前開始裝設。在開幕前四個月内，曾經郵政部工程師詳細試騐。該局現裝容量爲三千四百户，將來可擴充至一萬户，所用選擇器僅爲横轉式，簡單而省費。據該公司營業部經理向報界聲稱，此式比史端橋式（Strowger　System）機價，低百分之二十，所佔面積，少百分之三十，重量輕百分之四十，電力省百分之十，各級選擇器間之趖綫，省百分之二十九，而維持費，亦可减省若干，就各種優點上觀察，將來採用者必多。此式不獨合於大城市之用，卽鄕村小局無人管理者，亦甚適用。茲將其優點及設備槪略。分述如左：</p>
<p>（一）分道式之優點</p>
<p>分道式自動機之優點，卽爲兩户通話時，僅佔用極少之機件。在他工自動電話，通常用以選擇號碼，爲價値昂貴而製造複雜之選擇器；且自選擇號碼時起，至通話完畢，始終佔用，其他用户不能公用。其所附之繼電器（relays）與零件等，雖其中之一部，只用作選擇號碼，而通話時不需用者，亦須被佔。獨此式則否，所有選擇號碼工作，係由另一部份之分道式選擇器，分步爲之。一經選畢，隨卽撤綫，以備他户佔用；故通話時佔而不用之各件，可以减去。各級選擇器之迥路（Circuit）自可簡單，有祇備繼電器一個者，機件設備，因而减少。每套分道式選擇器，係用横轉式選擇器數個。及繼電器數個合成。全局所需之分道式選擇器亦不多。每套分道式選擇器，可供十户呌喚之用，附圖表示，用五位號碼之局，在呌號時各級機件動作之情形。（未完）</p>
<h3>四十萬</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>電報實行减價，人名地址十五個字者，作五個字計費。據電信界中人説。交通部創此新辦法，如報務仍如從前，以收入作比較，年約損失四十萬元。此四十萬元，交部所損失，當然是發報人的利益。</p>
<p>試作進一步之着想，譬如電報營業，减價之後，隨而發達，增收之數，足與四十萬元相抵補，則此項收入之四十萬元，全國電報局台，仍照所行人名在址减費辦法報頭不計，至少須較往年多收發電文約六百萬個字。耗電幾何？耗材料（包括紙條，墨油，收發轉報紙等等）幾何？記者雖無暇作精密之統計，但其數當不在少矣。</p>
<p>再就工作上着想，卽增發增收六百萬個字，如每個字作四碼計算，卽須多拍發多抄錄二千四百萬個電碼。又如每個電碼，平均點畫凡三，則値機人員，增拍電信符號之點畫，總數當爲七千二百萬！此雖就全國而言，然中間局轉報及每張報頭字數，尙未計及，故實際上决不祇此。</p>
<p>社會人士，請試爲推想，莫小覷了此次電報减價！</p>
<h3>怎樣利用交際電報</h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>電報本是極平常的通訊工具，在外國人眼光中看來航郵快信一般，並不　十分希奇。但在我們民智尙未發達的國内，一般普通民衆，因利用電報的時候太少，所以認爲電報幾乎是不祥之物。因爲接到了電報，不是報告家屬或親友的病重或噩耗，便是出了其他亂子，好好的總不會接到電報的。在這種情况之下，電報事業之不能充分發展，乃是當然的了！</p>
<p>最近交通部看出了這個弱點，所以添辦了一種交際電報，要使一般民衆都有嘗試利用電報的機會。祇費幾角錢的報費，便可打一個電報給親友，而且電文不定是報告不祥之事，例如慶賀結婚，壽辰，添嗣等等，使電報變成吉祥之物。慢慢地造成一種風氣，在民衆腦海中，祇知電報是一種通訊最快的利器，有了要事，如郵信趕不及，就利用電報。親友如有婚喪喜事，就打一個交際電報去祝賀或弔唁，免得嘮嘮叨叨的寫一封長信去恭賀或慰唁，卽省自已寫信的時間，又省受者看信的時間。並且電報總比較郵信名貴，所以受者接到電報，必特别注意。如欲對於親友表示特别感情，丨或者不妨坦白的説，想討好對方，那末尤非利用電報不可。現在我把怎樣利用交際電報的辦法説一説，希望大家樂於利用，獲得（化小費而收大效）的利益。</p>
<p>（一）遇下列各種的事情發生時，就應利用交際電報向親友慶賀，表示好感：（一）親友結婚（二）親友壽辰（三）親友添生子女或孫子女（四）親友陞遷（五）親友學校畢業或受學位（六）親友營業得利或獲獎（七）親友出國或返國（八）同行開張（九）軍隊克敵獲勝（十）親友發明新事物（十）（一）公路通車，輪船下水，飛機命名，房屋落成等典禮（十）（二）耶誔及新年（十）（三）親友當選要職（十）（四）運動員獲勝或創造新紀錄（十）（五）其他可以慶賀的事。</p>
<p>（二）遇下列各種事情發生時，應立刻發寄交際電報向親友慰唁，表示同情：（一）親友本人或家屬患病（二）親友本人或家屬病故（三）親友本人或家憎臨時遭遇變故，如遇盜，被綁，水火災，受傷，被誣或被捕，等等（四）親友之家屬營葬或忌辰紀念（五）團體罷工或解散（六）震災或其他天災（七）地方被敵人或匪共蹂躪（八）親友營業失利（九）親友競選失敗（十）其他應行慰問或弔唁的事。</p>
<p>（三）接到親友發來慶賀或慰唁之交際電報時，應立卽回電，表示謝意，此項回電亦作交際電報論。</p>
<p>以上所説的利用交際電報辦法，並不是記者單純替電報局宣傳，拉生意，實在是爲大衆提倡用電報與親友交際。若平時交際得法，則親友必樂爲扶助，無論欲辦何事，都很容易成功。所以記者敢説，利用交際電報，就如播下成功的種子一般。再進一步説，交際電報就是成功電報。凡是素來交際廣闊的人，不可不打交際電報！不打交際電報的人，就不能算是交際廣闊！同時有婚喪事的人，必須於辦事那天，接到幾十或幾百通交際電報，那才算是交際廣闊，十足面子！</p>
<p>還有一點，普通交情不甚深摰的親友，寄來婚喪的請帖或訃告時，送禮太厚似不値得，太薄受者又必不甚满意，若改用交際電報，則反可使受者覺得快慰，實際上所費反爲簡省，眞是（一舉兩得！）</p>
<p>此外，我希望電局對於交際電報的投送時間，能依從發報人的指定時刻投送。譬如受電者於某日下午四時結婚，發電者可要求卽於是日下午四時送到，俾受電者感覺特别欣慰。因於投送過早或過遲，卽失去電報的時效性了。這個指定時刻，可書在電文及署名之後，如（一六○○），代表下午四時，作一字計費。如路遠可再加一日期，用韻目或電碼代表，亦作一字計費。</p>
<h3>各國無綫電話發展的近况（下）</h3>
<p>— 王大椿譯</p>
<p>超短波無綫電話（UltraShortWaveor.MicroRay)的進於實用，爲近年交通界最大的成功。牠是用極短的電波，放射達於較遠的地方，旣無衰落，回聲，變音等弊病，又因電波較短，可以保持通信的秘密，關於軍事或其他交通上，有無限的貢獻。這種超短波無綫電話，於一九三一年三年三十一日，在英國的度佛（Dover）和法國的加拉（Calaio)兩地試演後，現在實用，已至很完美的程度。這一次的試演，是雙信通話方式（Two　way　System），所用電波爲十八生的米突（i8c.m.），天綫僅用兩生的米突。兩地表演時，各有聽衆三十餘人，利用此項電話，作横渡度佛海峽的通話。其結果所得，以如此長度的電波，並不如普通電波的易於衰落，更不易受雨或霧所吸收。再有一優點，卽在普通的無綫電話發話機中，各機的電波長，均須一律。如爲超短波電話，則在一萬具發話機中，其每一機的電波長，卽各有不同，而發話仍可有效的，約占全數四分之一云。</p>
<p>在一九三○丨丨三一年間，英國國際電報電話試騐所，連合法國電話材料試騐所，曾公開試騐一種短波上用的單面發射無綫電話（Single　Side　Band　System　kf　Radio　Telephone)。試騐的結果，很明確的證實這種無綫電話，對於短波的連絡，已進化至可以商用的程度，一九三一年五月二十一日，在西班牙京城瑪德利，和巴黎附近德拉班（Trappes)兩地，把這種無綫電話，公開表演，當時約有聽衆七十餘人，靜聽雙方用英法語通話，及表演一種特製的信號，約一小時之久，所得成績極佳。至於多面發射方式（Spread　Side　Band　System)，應用在短波無綫電話上的，亦有進步，其程度可將因電波衰落，而發生的變音，完全消滅或减少。</p>
<p>行動的交通利器，如海洋中航行的巨輪，現在均有裝置無綫電話，使航行中的旅客，可與歐美各大都市的任何電話用户，作直接談話。加拿大太平洋鐵路公司的郵船（英后號）Empress,fBritain)其無綫電話，早經裝用，和陸上電話，直接通話。美國各地的電話，已接通富奈士公司郵船（班墨達大帝號）（Monarch　of　Bermudna），（班爾琴蘭特號）輪船（S.S　Belgenland）的無綫電話，當該輪等開行世界班時，曾有數次高紀錄的横斷大洋的通話：第一　卽大科學家愛因斯坦，及其他名人，利用此項電話，在紐約埠頭，作全國廣播。第二次則發自中美洲沿岸太平洋中，均有顯着的成績。其他無綫電話的通連，有我國領海的直通美國，孟買直達倫敦，紅海通達美國，埃及的亞歷山大港至華盛頓，都在最近開放。（完）</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>— 社友</p>
<p>改訂電報掛號章程</p>
<p>交通部近因現行電報掛號章程尙係舊交部所訂定，迄今沿用將近十載，對於現在情形多不適宜，故特重行修訂，自本年四月一日起實行。茲將新章重要各點摘錄於後：</p>
<p>（一）電報掛號祇須向電報局或電臺一處掛號，兩處均可通用。（如上海有電報局，國内電臺，國際電臺，三水綫收發處等六處，祇須向設在電報局之聯合掛號處掛號，各處均可有效。）</p>
<p>（二）華洋文掛號可以通用。（舊章華文電報不准用洋文掛號。）</p>
<p>（三）掛號分三種：一·三年二十五元，二·一年十元，一月一元。三年及一年掛號之有效期間，上半年掛者，自一月一日起算，至年終爲止。下半年掛者，自七月一日起算，至第四年或第二年之六月三十日爲止。一月掛號一律自掛號之月一日起算，至月終爲止。此項掛號可一次請掛數月。（尙宋满期之掛號，可俟期满後，再照新章掛號。）</p>
<p>上述一二兩點，於發報民衆極爲有利。第三點掛號費按整月及整年計算，掛號似稍吃虧，但掛三年長期者，可省費五元之多，凡商行長期營業者，均可得此利益，又在每年三四月或八九月間，欲掛長期掛號者，可先掛短期數月，至六月底或年底再掛長期，則担失更數云。</p>
<p>預付回電由電局通知收報人注意</p>
<p>電局爲便利收發報人起見，向有發報人預付回電報費辦法，以便收報人接電後，卽行覆電，無須付費。惟此項辦法，吾國民衆仍多不甚明瞭，故　利用者極少卽有利用者，往往收報人不明究竟，延不回電，以致發報人久候焦急，以爲電局延攔電報，或漏未通知收報人，頗多悮會，交部茲爲辦事週到起見，特通飭各局臺嗣後遇有此項電報應在電底上加蓋（此電已由發報人預付回電費請卽持所附回電憑單來局拍發回電）之戳記，俾使收報人注意。如電報送達後，三日内尙不回電者，再由局臺去函催詢一次，以免遺忘云。</p>
<p>長途電話局處代售電話號簿</p>
<p>凡通達長途電話各地之市内電話用户，如需用他處電話局或商辦電話公司之電話號簿者，可向當地電話局或商辦電話公司請求代購。此項辦法最近交部已通飭各電話局，並轉知各商辦電話公司照辦云。</p>
<h3>電信界與新聞界之合作談</h3>
<p>— 葉仲華</p>
<p>一國之文化，恒視其新聞事業之發達與否爲斷。</p>
<p>而輔助新聞事業之發達，電信交通實有深切之關係，蓋傳遞消息，非恃電信爲利器不可。舉凡世界各國政治經濟之動向，天災人事之變遷，胥賴電信之傳達，瞬息供呈於吾人之眼簾。設報紙而無電信之記載，是貶抑共本身之價値；電信而不克供新聞傳遞之運用，是未能盡服務社會之職責。是故世界各國之電信事業，不論其爲國營與否，對於新聞事業之種種合作與扶助，莫不盡力以赴之，誠以報紙爲民衆之喉舌；輿論之先導，輔助新聞事業，卽所以維護文化也。</p>
<p>我國自創辦電報以來，對於新聞消息之傳遞，卽仿照世界各國成例，予新聞界以種種之便利。如减低新聞電報價目，實行收報人付費制度，皆爲新聞界特享之權利。近年以來，雖因人員薪工之增高，機件材料之昂貴，電政支出，歲有遞加。然交通當局，在此艱難困苦之中，猶設法謀新聞界負擔之减輕。如自本年一月一日起，凡加急新聞電報，槪作尋常電報計費，卽其一例。</p>
<p>邇來吾國新聞事業，日趨蓬勃。晨刊晚報，晝夜出版。消息之需求旣殷，新聞電報之拍發，亦隨之頻繁。電局職員，對於傳遞新聞電報，向極注意。大抵在報紙付印以前，務必處理完畢，俾當天電報，得以刊出。此種服務精神，固爲電局應盡之職責。要亦電報與新聞，同爲文化而努力，彼此旣具有共同使命，遂不謀而願合作到底也。</p>
<p>電局對於新聞界之合作，旣如上述。然有一事，足爲新聞界所最不愉快者，卽新聞檢查是也。考政府設置檢查之目的，無非防止造謡挑撥者之陰謀，初非對於新聞界有苛刻之待遇。顧電局方面，深知新聞界之痛苦，故對於檢查電報手續，力求簡單與迅速，俾新聞電報不因檢查而稍受稽延。此種事實，當爲新聞界所熟知而又爲新聞界所共諒者也。</p>
<p>最後，吾人所希望於新聞界者：年來電報業務，鋭意革新，尤以電報價目，力求減低，俾適合社會之需要，如創辦廉價交際電報，改訂收報人姓名住址計字辦法，以及加急電報減價，查問公電免費等等，皆爲减輕收發報人之負擔。交通部因此减少收入，年約五十萬元以上，此種非常之改革，蓋欲使社會充分利用電報爲通信之工具，俾電局獲得更多服務之機會，顧此項减價辦法之實行，非有廣大之宣傳，難期引起社會之注意，故目前最要之工作，在如何喚起民衆養成發電之習惯，此則有賴於新聞界之合作與指導矣。</p>

<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>時輪向前進展，輾醒了一般困苦得已經麻木了的人們，女子卽其中的一部分·全世界的婦女，在重重壓迫下，拚命的呐喊，這已成了十九世紀未葉以來的史實，有的已經獲得了光明的前程。</p>
<p>我國自（五四）後，婦女運動，在歷史上亦成爲劃時代的一頁。當時婦女問題的刊物之多，一如雨後春笋，但僅是　花一現，不久卽漸消沉，了丨是不是中國婦女已獲得了光明的前途，可不必呐喊了？没有醒覺的婦女當然瞠目不知回答，醒覺了的婦女，必悽然地應聲説：（没有）。</p>
<p>現在少數的婦女已由家庭解放到學校裏，由學校解放到社會是來了，可是她們所表現的事實：大多數都隨着時代的駭浪，捲入了摩登之途，參加什麽（時裝大會）佈置華美的新家庭，只知迎頭趕上西方的文明，因此做了帝國主義商品的好主顧：不但做了承銷外國貨的奴隸，且又做了摩登玩物。另有一部份知識婦女，醉心於戀愛至上主義，藝術至上主義，做着（愛）（美）的迷夢。至於農村婦女依舊過着困苦的牛馬生活，都會裏工廠中的女工，更是度着無知無識地勞苦生涯。我們現在開闢了這小小的園地，希望同胞們合力來灌漑。努力來耕耘。舒寫你們的所要主張，訴説你們的一切苦難；我們更接受男同胞們的一切好意的指示。希望在這崎嶇的世途上，共存共營地生活。</p>
<h3>快開拓婦女的園地！</h3>
<p>— 碧遥</p>
<p>那兒有婦女的園地？找遍了國中，多見婦女是屬從。婦女已往是貧無立足之地，因爲這個，纔纒了錐也似的小足；現在，雖説是已經解放，也只有，空空一雙七寸不到的天足。</p>
<p>婦女已經是極和順的綿羊，婦女已經是再破落不過的愚物。爲了衣食住，而零賣（娼妓）或整賣（嫁人）她們的肉；爲了無緣求知，或是有所知而因身不由主不敢直行，而賣了她們的靈；最後，再以没有靈魂的手，應付當前的世界或養育未來的生命，而賣了她們的種。</p>
<p>在舊社會，婦女雖没有獨立的園地，但她們也還附屬於男子，烹調理家，養蠶採茶，帮着辛勤地工作。可是新社會，摩登婦女便革了這些工作的命：所奉的天經地義，是穿吃逍遥。於是她們成了男子園地中的蜂蝶，再壞一點説，便成了狐狸。像中國這樣破落的社會，男子能有多少耕耘的氣力？而况加擔這些蜂蝶的紛擾，狐狸的齦　？</p>
<p>婦女並不是絕對没有園地，正如中國並不是没有遼闊的土地；然而一半已經被人剥削，一半正在自已放棄。</p>
<p>最痛心的是新時代婦女的自已放棄丨爲了享樂，安逸，寄生，情願望着國中日深地沉淪，男子日烈地受到兩重人的壓迫，自已却退居於蜂蝶狐狸的非人的地位丨</p>
<p>我們從不談世界人類的大問題，在目前國中婦女急急應開拓的園地，最少有這種工作：拯救商品的肉身，使之獨立自尊：拯救昏暗的靈魂，使之聰明潔凈；拯救垂亡的種族，使之光大長存。</p>
<p>我們的園地，被人剥削了的，無疑地要趕緊收回；至於自已放棄了的，不努力收回也太失了（人）的氣味。我們總要大聲呼喊：（快開拓婦女的園地）丨</p>
<h3>誰的（婦女園地）</h3>
<p>— 敏之</p>
<p>中國因爲阿Q出得太多，以致婦女在社會中的地位簡直被看做不需要的東西。本來中國古代的士大夫就把婦女當作危險品：而中國阿Q又是個個都以（聖人）與（萬能博士）自任，於是婦女在社會上的地位尤其全部被否認了。中國全部歷史劇的塲面上，都可以老伶工扮裝的宮女，王后，林黛玉來（演出，）可知婦女在阿Q叢生之國看來，已經被作爲可以扮裝的東西，因爲阿Q都是萬能博士，阿Q都具有婦女的身手。</p>
<p>所以於今日而談開闢（婦女園地，）得母感慨系之？</p>
<p>中國婦女的太太層，小姐層，以及甚麽（花）與（后）之層，都是以X爲職業的。</p>
<p>（婦女園地）自然是（男人莫入，）而婦女之中也似乎不是任人都可以進來，希望這裏將排除太太小姐式的（悶悶不樂到公園裏去散散心）的怡情逸致，爲社會生產和能爲實際生活奮鬥的婦女來參加這業餘的公園。</p>
<p>希望這裏要嚴厲地　棄討論怎樣取悦男子以博得男子施惠的文章，反之，應當提供勞動婦女在實際生活中的史料，和怎樣取得社會平等以及把婦女貢獻於社會的事業重新估定的商榷。</p>
<h3>愛倫凱與柯崙泰</h3>
<p>— 紫</p>
<p>愛倫凱和柯崙泰，是女界的先覺，對於女性解放問題，都有卓絕的見地。下面是關於她俩的談話記錄。</p>
<p>紫文　今天，我們預備會談的題材：是（愛倫凱與柯崙泰）。</p>
<p>瑛瑛　柯崙泰不是著述（三代戀愛）和（赤鳥等）小説的蘇聯女文學家嗎？</p>
<p>紫文　她不但是文學家，而且是外交家，曾做過駐挪威大使及駐墨西哥大使。</p>
<p>斐佩　這兩位世界的女性，他們的言論，確是値得我們研究的。只是我對於這兩個人的生世言行，都不明瞭。現在我把我所不明瞭的提出來，請你們指敎：愛倫凱是生於那一國的？</p>
<p>紫文　她於一八四九年生於瑞典南部的一個小都市裏，父親曾做過内閣的國務員。母親亦受過高等敎育，很熱心於婦女解放問題的，所以愛倫凱後來的提倡婦女解放運動，不是無因的。</p>
<p>斐佩　愛倫凱的人生觀是怎樣的？</p>
<p>紫文　她是個唯心的樂觀論者。她主張卽然生在這個世界上，心身都應該很康健的，很快樂的，而且强有力地生活着。她説過（我們的生活，應該終日有謙遜的心情，寛懹的胸襟，對一切事物，都應有大詩人那樣的深刻的理解，任何時都應該像小孩子那樣的天眞愉快和活潑。）這幾句話裏面，我們可以想像到她的人生觀是怎樣的光明與謙和，寛綽與大度。</p>
<p>瑛瑛　這樣看起來，愛倫凱也不過是一個妥恊於現實的人物而已。</p>
<p>紫文　那也不能説，假使她是個現實的妥恊者，她怎麽會在那時代，呌出（解放婦女）的呼聲？不過他拿（愛）來調和人生，旣不尤天亦不恨人，同時絕不是現實的妥恊者而是反抗者。她也不像一般女子，不满於現實生活，同時却仍沉淪於現實生活而不能自拔。</p>
<p>斐佩　愛倫凱的婦女運動有怎樣幾個目標？</p>
<p>紫文　她提出過三個信條。一，結婚應以戀愛爲基礎。二，自由離婚。三，母性復興。</p>
<p>瑛瑛　記得愛倫凱的主張戀愛結婚，是根據優生學的。是嗎？</p>
<p>紫文　是的。她曾經説：（戀愛是神聖的，是一切文化的淵源。戀愛結婚的雙方，必感到無上的幸福，在這樣生活下所產生的小孩，必比一般没有愛的夫婦所生的小孩聰明。不過愛倫凱這個見地，確是缺少科學上的根據，她只説歷史上的所謂大偉人，或者大藝術家，大思想家，大半都是私生子，換句話説，他們的父母大多都是由戀愛而結合的。（待續）</p>
<h3>世界婦女參政權之爭取</h3>
<p>— 京</p>
<p>自十九世紀未葉以來，世界各國婦女，都想在政治上有與男子同等的地位。所以各國婦女大都以獲得參政權爲解放運動的先决問題。茲將先後獲得參政權的國家，列舉如下：</p>
<p>澳洲　一八九三年　芬蘭　一九０六年</p>
<p>那威　一九一五年　丹麥　一九一五年</p>
<p>荷蘭　一九一七年　蘇聯　一九一七年</p>
<p>英國　一九一八年　德國　一九一九年</p>
<p>匈牙利一九一九年</p>
<p>南美　一九一九年　美國　一九二０年</p>
<p>波蘭　一九二一年　瑞典　一九二一年</p>
<p>加拿大一九二一年　希臘　一九三０年</p>
<p>西班牙一九三一年</p>
<p>至於法國，日本，意大利，瑞士，羅馬尼亞等國的婦女，雖在社會上已有相當的地位，且亦不斷運動着政權的獲得，但終未得諸執政者的容許。</p>
<h3>寫給（婦女園地）</h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>沉寂的空氣，彌漫在我們的周遭，使得我們近於窒息了。</p>
<p>雖然婦女們各個在繼續不斷地和環境奮鬥着，消極的抵抗：但這些微薄的力量，因爲没有集合起來，終於是被大壓力消滅了。</p>
<p>（婦女的（團結力）很薄弱）是事實，這是誰都不能否認的。不利的環境，分散了婦女的團結力，這不是婦女本身的缺陷。所以現在醒覺了的婦女們應怎樣積極的團結起來，集中力量，在一個比較中心的思想的指導下，有系統，有組織有方法地一致去對付她們的困難的環境但是，有什麽法子可以使這些身處於不利的環境中的婦女們團結起來；集合這些各個人的奮鬥，抵抗，掙扎，發揮偉大的力量？我想（文字）是一個最有力量的工具。</p>
<p>因此，在（婦女園地）初刋的時候，我不覺以十二分的眞誠，祝牠</p>
<p>是婦女思想的中心丨</p>
<p>是婦女團結的工具丨</p>
<p>是婦女運動的先鋒丨</p>
<h3>女子之一生</h3>
<p>— 玄文</p>
<p>在這生存競爭日益激烈的舞台上貪生，實是一椿不容易的事情。但人總是貪生怕死的。生，要健全的生，　弱病軀，都不能在這人生舞台上扮演好脚色，要有健全的身體，固由於不時的鍜鍊與攝生，但是先天也是要緊的，在人類尙未取得别種方法來保存種族的今日，母體的健全更是緊要，有健全的母體，才有健全的胎兒；健全的胎兒，便容易成長。長大後可成爲健全的國民。所以女子一生的健全，不但是她個人爲爭取生存所必需，而且對於民族生存的前途也很有關係的。茲將（女子之一生）應注意諸點，分段獻諸讀者。</p>
<p>一·性芽</p>
<p>拜倫八歲時就知道戀愛，但丁九歲已有戀人，大都聰明人總是早熟的，在這種情形下，做母親的，應該特注意的是；小兒的性芽究竟發生於什麽時候，與用怎樣形態來表現，這全在做母親的在默察靜觀中細心領會，加以指導。</p>
<p>當小兒性芽初發時，做母親的最需注意小孩有無（自凟）行爲，小兒的這種行爲，卽使尙在摇擺學步中的三四歲時，亦因某種觸感，使他永成不可磨　的惡癖。</p>
<p>特别應該注意的：小兒有否患有燒虫丨丨常寄生於肛門口的一種小虫，能使小孩之肛門作奇癢丨丨因燒虫常喜在夜間出肛門產卵，它回去時，假使誤入小孩的陰部，必感奇癢而搔摸，搔摸後必覺快感，因此而成（自凟）的習慣。此外，還有因排尿後，不使之清潔，最後必致奇癢，因搔癢亦能成爲（自凟）的惡習，不過在這時期的小孩，都是天眞活潑，大可敎育的時候，假使做母親的，能够發現她的惡習，早予適當的暗示與敎導，那是不難矯正的。萬一做母親的，不注意她，或放任她，使她養成不能自制的習慣，及至破瓜期，春青血運行於备管中，同時因内分泌的作用，本能地性的衝動，隨之而起，一至此時，前述惡習，已難矯正，影響於本人的終身幸福與健全，甚且患不姙症，世之爲母者不可不注意的。</p>

<h3>天才迷宮</h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>在歷史的發展過程中，有許多偉大的發明家出現。人們對於這些發明家都是當作（天才）來理解，認爲他們的聰明，智慧，才能都是天賦的，説他們與常人根本不同。如果誰要對此表示異議，那麽，具有此種見解的人們馬上就要發問：何以祇有瓦特才能發明蒸汽機，祇有史蒂芬生才能發明火車，祇有富爾敦才能發明汽船，而别的人却不能呢？這不是發明家與常人不同的實證嗎？</p>
<p>不錯，一切偉大的發明家都是天才，他們的天資大半都要比一般人聰明，但這也祇是使他們有成爲發明家的可能的一種因素，而使這可能成爲現實的却是他們所處的環境。瓦特雖然聰明，但他如不能作機械師的徒弟，如不能作格刺斯哥大學數學上的汽機師，是不能發明蒸汽機的。史蒂芬生和富爾敦之成爲火車與汽船的發明家者，亦與其所生活的環境有不可分離的關係。</p>
<p>同時，社會文化之發展程度，更是規定一切偉大的發明家之成爲怎樣的發明家的主要條件。無論怎樣聰明的人，就是他個人的生活環境非常美好，其成就也不能超過他所處的社會的文化之發展程度以外。孔明雖然聰明，但他在三國時代祇能發明木牛流馬，不能造出火車輪船；公輸子之巧，也不能在戰國時代建立近代式的洋房；就是瓦特，史蒂芬生和富爾敦那樣非凡的人，也不能在十八世紀發明巨大的電力機器。</p>
<p>還有，時代社會的要求，也同樣是制約一切發明家之成就的。瓦特之發明蒸汽機，史蒂芬生之發明火車，富爾敦之發明汽船，都是隨着文藝復興以來，封建社會之崩潰，近代（文明社會）之生長而出現的。因爲近代（文化社會）是建立基礎於工商業之上的，牠需要蒸汽機，火車，汽船等物，所以瓦特，史蒂芬生，富爾敦等才把牠們發明了出來。瓦特等不過是應了這需要的發明家，並不是超乎一切之上的神人。而且，我們還可以説，卽使没有瓦特等等的人物，至多也不過使近代的（文明社會）之發展遲緩些時間，但這社會必然要出現和發展却是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>所以，一切偉大的發明家的才能及其成就，是社會，時代給與他們的，並不是什麽天賦的。他們與常人一樣，是時代人，社會人，不是超時代，超社會的什麽（怪物）。他們之所以在若干的人中能特别地發明什麽者，主要地是因爲他們有適當的生活環境，能看出社會，時代之需要，並能在這需要下努力的緣故，實在没有什麽玄妙莫解的地方。</p>
<p>這樣的理論，不僅可以解釋一切偉大的發明家，同時亦可用以解釋一切政治的，學術的，文藝的偉大的天才。天才的迷宮，由此是可完全打開的。</p>
<p>當然，這祇是對於一切偉大的發明家，天才之科學的理解，並不是在否認他們對於人類社會的功績。</p>

<p>我，我是一個入世未深的處子，現在XX工廠裏當一個似重要而非重要的小職員，丨丨一個極小極小的職員。在諸同事的頭腦裏，委實並没有這樣一個似人非人的深印着。在我呢，也覺得太不自重，終是鞠躬盡瘁地接受一切指揮，好似事實的這樣，都已在命中鐵注了的。</p>
<p>XX工廠的範圍很大，工人佔全廠人數約百分之九十六。因爲工作的程度很高貴，所以生活也超過一切工人之上，因此他們的眼界，他們的身家，也都拴上了額角了。</p>
<p>樹生是經理室裏的茶房丨丨經理的内戚，丨丨是一個勢利小人，他的工資超過我一倍，無怪他會呼么喝六，倚勢凌人呢。</p>
<p>提起我的地位，終算比樹生高上一籌，可是要使喚他，却很難能。他非但不應你，還分外給你一個兇狠的面色，使你難堪，有時還給你一股酸氣。</p>
<p>（喂丨樹生丨請你將這東西送給王先生去，好不？）我含着笑容對樹生説。</p>
<p>（誰有空？没有空丨你自已走一趟就是了丨）他板起了臉用着連環式的答語咕嚕着。</p>
<p>（喂丨樹生！去請王先生來丨）接着是經理的吩咐。</p>
<p>（噢丨噢丨噢丨好丨·········樹生連聲應着，走了。</p>
<p>（樹生丨那末帶帶給他吧丨）</p>
<p>（不丨不丨我還要往别處去丨）這明顯地是一個無理的藉口。</p>
<p>可是我並不能盡量地使出性來，祇有張大了嘴，把這股又酸又辣的氣嚥下去，向誰伸訴呢丨</p>
<p>陰曆元旦又在目前了，照我們廠規，在歲暮一次發薪時，有雙工可給，這次當然也不會例外囉丨</p>
<p>記得是一個明媚的早晨，工廠裏的機聲已在軋軋地響起來了。我踏進廠長室裏，劈頭就撞着樹生。</p>
<p>（哦丨早丨X先生丨）這是樹生對我罕有的恭維語。我也莫明其妙地回答了幾聲：（早丨早丨早丨）他提了茶壺去泡茶了。</p>
<p>火爐裏的煤燒得通紅的，把整個的房間移出了寒冷。那時廠長室裏還算是我第一個到，一切都在寂靜中，祇有熊熊的煤，在瑟瑟地奏着無節的調門。今天室裏的特象，一眼便使我驚奇：寫字檯上的東西，向來是零亂慣的，今天一只只都收拾的整整齊齊：檯子上的灰塵，向來用雞毛帚一拂就算，有時委實不拂，今天却一只只擦得亮亮的。這是好現象嗎？</p>
<p>樹生的茶已泡來了。</p>
<p>（X先生丨用茶丨）樹生端了杯熱勝勝的茶，放在我桌上。</p>
<p>樹生今天的舉動，今天的面色，着實使我突兀。不是他變了嗎？悔悟了嗎？</p>
<p>今天誰都知道是發雙工的日子，而且又挨着星期六，人人的臉上多浮起一層笑容。廠長室裏的職員，整天的不做事，只是談心。壁旁的電話忙得很，這個去找某小姐，那個去約某女士，更有人提議去闢房間，反正明天是星期日，落得逛個暢快。工人們做工也没有心緒，有些人眉展眼開，可是大部分人却並不這樣，他們有一羣債主追隨着，不見得有什麽樂意。</p>
<p>早晨就在這樣模糊中過去，大家所盼望的五點鐘展開了，工作的車機也停止了轉動。工人們都凈了面，穿好衣服，凖備出發，可是工錢還没有散。放工的鈴已響過了，廠長室裏頓時擠满了各部的拿瑪温，探詢工錢。</p>
<p>就門外站立着許許多多的人，幾乎把弄堂都塞住了。他們在幹什麽？是工人們的債主。</p>
<p>壁上的鐘已打了六下，可是散工錢的人還没有到。各層的扶梯上已站满着工人，不約而同的個個都朝着廠長室的門口瞅着。</p>
<p>這時經理也發急了，接連打了六七個電話到銀行裏，可是也見不到什麽動靜。</p>
<p>好容易挨到了六點半，銀行裏派來散工錢的人到了。霎時間廠長室裏擠的</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>水洩不通，爭先恐後的擁來擁去，寫字檯的脚個個都移了半尺多路。</p>
<p>一直到七點鐘，工錢才算發完，銀行裏的人也走了，那時廠長室裏的職員，還全没有跑。</p>
<p>（樹生丨這些些請你去買些酒喝罷）！）經理遞了一張十元的鈔票給樹生説。</p>
<p>（噢！噢！噢！謝謝你丨X先生丨）樹生接着謝道。</p>
<p>這時我的腦筋頓時聰明了起來；原來今天樹生這樣和靄，就爲的是·········</p>
<p>一個個地，樹生的節錢都收到了，隨後就要輪到我。我的心裏不時突突地跳個不停：我的腦裏刻刻在盤忖着··</p>
<p>（吓丨要我給他四元，那我一輩子不願，况且我好没有這筆錢，所拿的雙工，家裏的過年盤膳還不够。假使給他二元吧丨那给人家瞧見了，太覺吝惜些。人家都是給他四元，六元，八元的。但是，不丨不丨我的薪水比人家小，或許不會罷丨）</p>
<p>可是抬頭看見他今天那副和靄可親的福情，一顆心又軟了下來。人家的兩只眼珠，都注在我身上，不由得我兩只手都縮縮的抖了起來。</p>
<p>這時廠長室裏的人已走了大半，於是我的胆子又大了起來；他平日的那副凶狠的面孔，也隱隱地浮在我眼簾裏；所受的酸氣，也一般般地從心腔裏翻了出來。</p>
<p>（不丨一定給他二元丨）我心中斷定着。</p>
<p>（樹生丨這些不算什麽的，去呼口烟吧丨）我硬着頭皮遞了二元鈔票給他。</p>
<p>（噢丨··········謝謝你！）樹生接到錢，頓了一頓，兩只眼珠骨篤地轉了幾轉。</p>
<p>我面孔漲的通紅，低下臉向外一溜烟走了。</p>
<p>名人演講</p>
<h3>章友三先生講（青年修養的時代性）</h3>
<p>— 沈聘儒筆記</p>
<p>修養兩字的解釋是因一面不满於現實，一面要提高他的種種，向提高的理想的方向去不斷的努力，而定出來的這個方向，就是所謂修養。</p>
<p>（一）格言與修養是拿一句簡潔的槪括的言語來做標凖，通常以格言是高出於我們一切的成功人的經騐來做我們的模範，總無瑕疵，但也有錯誤的。只以個人利害爲前提而不顧衆人福利的，例如（明哲保身），這就是呌你不要傻，以犧牲一已而爲大衆，致把許多朝氣蓬勃，奮發有爲的青年，變成畏首畏尾，頽唐萎靡。如（國優則仕，國亂則退），這簡直是投機份子。然很好的格言也甚多，但不能作整個人生的模範，例如國家方面的（天下興亡，匹夫有責），這只是公民生活的標榜，不能顧到具體的。所以格言雖可以帮助我們修養，但因根據不妥當，或僅贪偏及一面的，不能供整個人生的模範。</p>
<p>（二）德目與修養古人提出許多字來做修養的標的，如仁，義，忠，孝，勤，樸，敬，愛等這許多德目，由各個不同的人定出來，根本是不相同的，那敎我們從何學起呢？而且這是抽象的，懸之牆壁用以警惕則可，但不能作整個人生的修養。加以這些德目又是無定義的。古時有人問孔子，（如何方爲孝），他説：（三年無違於父母），後來説：（生侍之以禮，死葬之以禮，祭之以禮），後又説：（給以飲食），最後説：（儀表恭敬爲孝）。又如仁字，先是（忠庶之道是仁），再爲（愛人是仁），更问：（講話要有愼重寸分），又説：（居處必恭，執事必敬，對人必忠）。這種德目全是空洞的，並不是具體的。孫中山先生提倡的忠孝，仁愛，信義，和平，他也説要隨着時代的潮流，根據科學的道理，把牠發揚光大起來，故德目是空洞而不够的。</p>
<p>（三）英雄崇拜與修養在青年時代是富於崇拜性的，如遇到或在書本上讀到文學上，科學上，政治上，和軍事上的成功偉人英雄豪傑時，總是崇拜得五體投地，把英雄偉人的懿行來做我們的模仿。這雖然是具體的，整個的，可以避免格言的偏仄和德目的空洞，但也有二種缺點：一·外表的，時勢造英雄，是時代的需要，環境的迫促，而把他造成的，二·内面的，天賦他的智識，才能，性情比常人特别高，在戰國時代能够出劉備，宋朝能够出岳飛，在時代幾經變遷的現在，還能够出劉備岳飛的第二人嗎？况且劉備的忠於一人，岳飛雖是爲民族而戰，但在緊急的時候得到皇帝的命令就退兵，以服從比對外更要緊，這是拘泥於君主，這可見英雄崇拜也並不完美的。</p>
<p>（四）修養之時代性根據以上三點，就可得一定義，就是修養是有時代性的。比仿東晉時代注重清淡，士大夫個個都是口才伶俐，咳吐珠玉，可是到現在就目爲空口説白話，只説不做的。宋朝是講究性情學理之説的，説得透徹就可做大官，但現在也不行了。更有俗語説（爲德最高，不狂言，不苟動），這是以中國來論，在外國也有的。譬如他們無論寫文章談話都要用拉丁文，又如崇拜武士道和修道士的怪行爲，他把自已的身體鎖在露天，不進飲食數天，任日灑雨淋，他説：（一個人能够克苦了肉體，他的人格一定會提高。）這些都是時代去迷住他們，在這個時代以這一種修養爲最妥當。</p>
<h3>勤奮的生活</h3>
<p>— 勁葉</p>
<p>（勤）是令人驚異的，有許多天才者利用了（勤）去創造他們的作品。西班牙詩人洛貝（Lope　de　Vega）很勤快地寫作了二千種左右的劇本，其中只有五百種能留傳到我們的時代，此外，他尙著有其他著作二十一卷以及别的許多詩篇。法國書賈萊凡（Levy），他是大文豪大仲馬許多著作的出版者。單據該書賈的目錄中所載，此項著作已計有三百卷之多，可是這目錄還是不完全的。又如女著作家喬治沁達（George　Sand），關於她，有這樣的一種傳説，説她在夜裏兩點鐘把一部長篇小説做完之後，便把一包白紙放在自已的座前，以便寫作另一部新的作品的首幾章。她的著作流傳於世的計共一百零九卷。著名數學家雷昂哈達，安萊（Leonhard　Euler），他的原稿至少當已印成三萬頁的印刷品，在這些印刷品中，每一行都充满着人們腦筋中所能想出的最難的問題。他又是特别富於記憶力的一個人，據説，他在二十二天之間就把（奥特賽和依利亞達）一書全部都記熟了。此外如大文豪歌德，他的著作的全集現在已全部刊行，計有一百三十卷之多。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>女子與服裝</h3>
<p>— 次元</p>
<p>最近風談着的關於女性的批評丨特别是女學生（大槪她們是智識份子國民中堅的緣故），莫過於服裝問題了。爲了這，有的發着很嚴厲的責語，説是歐化奢侈。有的憤慨地説是應該停閉學校，説這的確是社會上一個不容忽視的現象。在現在我國百業凋敝民不聊生的狀况下，女學生服裝的奢侈歐化是加速中國社會的危亡的。</p>
<p>本來不甚嚴重的事情，經了他們的指責批評後，倒反嚴重起來了。現在且讓我們毫無成見的來研究一下這所謂的（嚴重）吧？</p>
<p>社會每一現象的發生和存在，是都有牠發生和存在的根據與背景，是都有因果關係存乎其間的，絕不至有没有因而卽人果的，憑空出來的東西。依此，我們來把握女子爲什麽服裝都趨稚奢華的道上。最後來看一看女子服裝的奢華，是否像一部分人所説，爲阻止社會進化危族亡國的最大原因。</p>
<p>我們知道在現社會制度之下，主要的現象，是無論什麽都趨入於商業化資本化。女子在封建制度推移到現制度的過程裏，始終被視爲男子私有產業的一部分。因之一切都走入商業化時，女子亦就被看作特殊的商品了。在奸滑的男子的暴力的壓迫下，女性是没有一點兒反抗的餘地。脆弱的女性們，只有忍辱的服從着。社會環境的壓迫，男性有意的威逼，使她們不得不走上奢華的一途，來提高商品的價格。這是多麽悲慘的事實丨服裝的奢華乃是社會環境的壓逼，男性的過失，不改良現存的社會制度，不檢視自已的過失，只作着諷刺嘲笑，批評指責，這是徒然的。</p>
<p>退而講現在女子服裝的奢華，尤其是女學生們，但亦不見得是十分的罪惡，更不見得像一部分人所謂阻止進公危亡國家的大逆不道。我們知道，人類是有理性的動物，是具有愛美的本能，這種本能的發達，女子要比男子來得高。人類智識進步，愛美觀念更其發達。就男子講，我相信在這些發批評責備的人中間，一定不乏穿着高等西裝，綢緞外衣的，那末爲什麽女子不應穿紅着緑呢？説是不奢侈不穿紅着緑而卽表示愛國表示提倡國貨嗎？這只要看一看社會上的事實，恐怕外表樸質的反是大大的漢奸，洋貨的拍賣者！她們只要是在眞眞的研究學問，這又何用着冷嘲熱諷呢？</p>
<p>科學叢談</p>
<h3>科學小統計</h3>
<p>— 楚驀譯</p>
<p>（一）海水裏的金銀</p>
<p>海水含有大量的被溶解了的金和銀。在一百萬格蘭姆的海水中，我們可以提出一格蘭姆之千分之六的金子和一格蘭姆之千分之十九的銀子。據估計，海水裏金子的價値共有五千八百三十八萬億馬克之鉅，銀子則計値五百三十萬億馬克。所以，如果我們把這許多金銀給地球上十六萬萬人平均分配，則每人可分得三百五十萬馬克的金子和三十二萬馬克的銀子。</p>
<p>（二）各種文字的字彙</p>
<p>受過中等敎化的人，其所需用的各種不同的字或語，通常總不出於二千至三千之數。在（舊約）一書裏約含有五千八百個不同的字，（新約）四千儌百個，荷馬的（奥特賽和依利亞達）九千個，密爾頓的一切著作八千個，莎士比亞的一切著作二萬個。法文中所包含的字至多十一萬個，英文則有十二萬個。此外如格里姆氏所編著的（德文字典大全），經他加以增補之後，約可包含有五十萬各種不同的字，辭或語，而一切專有名字尙未計算在内。</p>
<p>（三）動植物的壽命</p>
<p>有幾種動物的壽命通常比人的壽命要長得多，例如有些貝介類動物有一百歲的壽命，鸚鵡，鷹，秃鷲，鵠和白頭鷹都在百歲以上，鯉，象和鯨魚則爲兩百歲。但最長命的動物恐怕要算是烏龜了。在馬胡里梯烏斯地方的砲兵營房裏有一隻活的烏龜，據估計，牠的年齡已有了三百歲。有一隻烏龜，牠在一九零六年死於倫敦動物園，體重有五百磅，據估計，牠共享年四百。在牠生前，牠在夏天所食的秣料比一隻母牛所需用的還多，但到了冬季，便絕食了。在一九一一年，有人捉到一隻烏龜，並發見在牠背上留有字句，百這字句却是一七九三年所留下的。</p>
<p>有些樹也是活到很長久的。在印度有過那樣的一株樹（但現在已經倒了），據那些科學家的判斷，牠的萌芽遠在七千年以前。這樣説來，那末，當美國林肯在世的時候，施已經是活了幾十世紀</p>

<h3>陸軍上尉</h3>
<p>— 書生</p>
<p>丨丨到而今百無一用</p>
<p>祇好向人間乞食丨丨</p>
<p>我是一個書生，從二十歲做事起，到而今是四十二歲了。在這二十二年中，雖也曾失過業，可是像這樣的長期失業，還是有生以來第一回。</p>
<p>説起這次失業，也有些寃枉。我本是在某團裏當上尉書記，因爲某團要開江西去了，我家裏的人，看我已不是青年，不願我路遠迢迢到江西去，呌我辭了職。那知這一辭職就陷入飢荒中了，從去年的八月，到現在還找不到職業。　　在那時，説江西是太遠了，並且有危險；可是到現在呢，路是一條也走不通，就是再遠的也没有了，有的，祇是飢餓的危險，一天一天的逼來。老妻是要養，幼子是要吃，但飄下來的雪花，當不來衣，掉下來的淚珠，換不成米。找朋友，朋友會避面，尋親戚，還不是同樣的碰壁。</p>
<p>因爲是書生，没有别的本領，祇學得人人愛的一手好趙字，行書是寫信用的，楷書是抄公文用的，但是有什麽用呢？投稿也不是容易的事，你要立刻換錢買米，更不容易。做得一遥好公文，現在没有人請敎你，更是一文不値。詩云子曰，固然換不來錢，社會民主，同樣也調不來米。這是書生的本領，現在想向人間換口飯吃，不知道誰需要這種本領？</p>
<p>附帶要説的，因爲我有一個家，所以生活費至少要四十元，並且要供膳宿的。人是康健，並無嗜好，也該在此説明。通信處請由本刊轉。</p>

<p>Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Troops to Take Charge of Southwestern Front</p>
<p>Jin Zunhua Meets with He Yingqin; Both Sides' Opinions Remain Far Apart</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, He Yingqin summoned Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Shang Zhen, Wan Fulin, Qin Dechun, Jiang Bocheng, and others to the Jurentang to discuss military plans against Sun Dianying. It has been decided that the Shanxi-Suiyuan Army will be responsible for the two northeastern routes, and the Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai troops will be responsible for the two southwestern routes to carry out encirclement and suppression. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, He Yingqin invited Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, and others to a meeting. This evening, He is hosting a banquet for Xu and Fu, with another meeting. The purpose of Xu and Fu's visit is to discuss issues such as the deployment of the Shanxi-Suiyuan troops. As a result, no final decision has been made and further detailed discussions are needed. However, militarily, all parties have made considerable preparations. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jin Zunhua, the Sun Dianying's subordinate deputy army commander who came to Beiping yesterday to express his allegiance, has met with He Yingqin and reported everything. The authorities believe that Sun has not expressed any intention to leave the army, which proves that he is not sincere. Before Sun actually leaves the army, nothing can be discussed. Sun intends because his troops are all trained by him, he cannot bear to leave suddenly. The authorities must guarantee his personal safety before he can leave the army. But before leaving, he wants to reorganize his troops slightly, so the opinions of both sides are still far apart. The resolution of the incident still awaits detailed discussion. There have only been minor skirmishes in the vicinity of Ningyuan in recent days. Sun's army launched a fierce attack on the provincial capital for seven days and nights, but ultimately failed to capture it, suffering heavy casualties. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi have repeatedly met with He Yingqin and have generally agreed on a plan to deal with Sun Dianying's troops. The important matters include the final advice to Sun. If it is ineffective, a joint suppression will be carried out by the five provinces of Shanxi, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. Jin Zunhua met with He and requested three conditions: First, Sun must leave the army, and the Military Council will guarantee his personal safety and freedom of residence. Second, Sun's army will withdraw to the area north of Dengkou in accordance with the Military Council's telegram order and request the restoration of the unit's salaries and supplies. Third, after Sun's army is reorganized and reduced, the Military Council will issue demobilization funds. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The various units that Yu Shiming contacted in the direction of Ningxia to surrender are all directly under Yu's command, most of whom are cavalry. Sun's basic units, such as the two brigades of Ding Futing and Liu Yueting, have not yet expressed any intention and are expected to be difficult to escape Sun's control. According to a telegram from Malaysia, Sun Dianying still intends to capture Ningxia City. Sun has personally gone to the front to command and is preparing to continue attacking Ningxia City. Therefore, Ningxia and Malaysia believe that Yu and others' contact to surrender may be a trick and have stopped proceeding. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The deployment of troops from Shanxi, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai can immediately encircle and suppress Sun Dianying. It is reported that the northeastern route will be undertaken by Fu Zuoyi and others, and the southwestern route will be undertaken by Ma Bufang, Ma Hongkui, Zhu Shaoliang, and other units. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's army attacked Ningyuan, but because they had no artillery, they used cloud ladders to climb the city. The Ningxia army still poured water on them, and the city walls were frozen into ice, making Sun's army's climbing ineffective. Ningyuan became a crystal palace, which is also an interesting anecdote in the war. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Guihua, after the Shanxi army was dispatched, it continued to move west. Wang Jingguo will go to Linhe to supervise the army after Fu Zuoyi returns to Suiyuan. From New Year's Eve, Sun's army launched three fierce attacks on Ningxia City, and the fighting was fierce. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, but Ningxia City was not captured by Sun's army. The people of western Suiyuan are exhausted and unable to supply the army again. The Shanxi army is conscripting mules and horses from various counties in northern Yanbei for military use. The source of grain and fodder in the Hetao area has been cut off, making the march very difficult. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to military news, it is not difficult for the Shanxi-Suiyuan army to solve Sun's troops based on their strength. Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi came to Beiping with the intention of advising Sun again, which may be the case. But the key is whether Sun himself has sincere intentions to repent and immediately comply with the Military Council's previous telegram order to withdraw his troops to their original defense area north of Dengkou to await reorganization and reduction. Otherwise, nothing can be tolerated. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin reported to the capital that Sun Dianying's ambition is difficult to tame, but among his subordinates, middle and lower-ranking officers, there are quite a few who understand righteousness and are very dissatisfied with Sun's actions, but they dare not do anything under his authority. The Military Council has sent Sun a final warning, asking him to hand over his troops to Yu Shiming for reorganization. If Sun can comply and leave the army, then this matter can be resolved peacefully. Otherwise, a thorough encirclement and suppression by the five-province allied forces will be carried out to avoid prolonging the war. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Abolish the Four Northeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Redesignating Sixteen Administrative Units</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters has decided to abolish the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe starting from March 1st and redesignate them into sixteen administrative units, including Yingkou, Andong, Fengtian, Jinzhou, Chengde, Chifeng, Yanji, Shanchengzhen, Xinjing, Jilin, Harbin, Puklani, Qinnaya, Qiqihar, Beianzhen, Daheihe, and Jiamusi. The political purposes are: First, to weaken local political power and complete centralization. In other words, if political power is concentrated, it will be easier for the Japanese army to rule. Second, there are currently about 200,000 puppet troops stationed in the provincial capitals and key areas of the four provinces. If the administrative units are reduced in size, distributing the puppet troops among the various administrative districts is actually dividing the puppet army into smaller units, making it easier to control. The military purposes are: First, when the administrative center is captured by the enemy, it will inevitably hinder financial requisition and other matters. If more administrative centers are built, even if one is captured, there will still be another, which is called "step by step." This is very convenient for combat. Second, after the establishment of each administrative center, strict guards and communication will naturally be maintained. Therefore, the establishment of sixteen administrative districts is equivalent to setting up sixteen military centers in the Northeast, which are connected to form a large military network. (17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Dagge is currently stationed with more than 3,000 soldiers from the rebel army under Zhang HaiPeng and the Japanese army. More than a dozen planes are parked at the airfield. The Japanese and puppet troops rotate defenses between Dagge Town and Heidaying every month. Their only task is to supervise the construction of roads. (17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from western Rehe said that the Japanese are actively building roads in western Rehe. The ones that have been recently completed include a 50 li (Chinese miles) stretch from Dagge Town to Yangmuzhaizi and a 40 li stretch from Yangmuzhaizi to Heidaying. The section is currently under construction. Several planes are parked at the Dagge airfield. The Heihe airfield is smaller and is only used for takeoffs and landings. No planes are parked there. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Prepares to Stage a Farce</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The enthronement ceremony of the (Manchukuo) emperor? is scheduled to be held in Changchun on March 1st. The ceremony is divided into four types, and everything is based on simplicity. It is predetermined to be carried out simply. (A) Suburban sacrifice: It is predetermined to be held at the temporary altar, which is 4 feet 5 inches high and 57 feet in diameter, from 8:00 AM to about 8:15 AM on March 1st. (B) Enthronement: It is predetermined to be held at the ceremony ground inside the Executive Government at noon for about 20 minutes on the same day. (C) Banquet: The first banquet will be held on the 2nd, and the second banquet will be held on the 3rd. (D) Military parade and naval review: The military parade will be held at the Changchun airfield, and the naval review will be held in Harbin, between late April and late May. Those participating in the ceremony will include high-ranking officials of the Manchukuo government and representatives of local organizations. In addition, news reporters can watch the ceremony rehearsal on February 27th and the interior of the ceremony ground on the 28th. (17th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhongying's Remnants Retreat to Hami</h3>
<p>Heavy Fighting Near Turpan</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Dihua, after Ma Zhongying's failed siege of the provincial capital, the remnants retreated to Hami. Sheng Shicai led his troops in pursuit, and there is heavy fighting near Turpan. Ma's troops suffered a disastrous defeat this time, with heavy losses, and are unable to counterattack. The military situation in southern Xinjiang will soon end. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from New Delhi quoting sources in Kashgar today, fierce fighting continues in Xinjiang. The new Hui government has again sent troops to attack the new city of Kashgar but retreated after suffering heavy losses. The Donggan tribes have now turned from defense to offense. The new government has detained Donggan representatives from Aksu who intended to open negotiations, which has further complicated the situation. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three Thousand Dispersed Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Arrive in Guangzhou and Temporarily Stationed in Huangpu</h3>
<p>Chen Jitang Will Allocate Them to Various Units for Replenishment</p>
<p>Longyan Decided to Be Handed Over to the Central Army for Defense</p>
<p>Hu Mulan Arrives in Guangzhou on Her Father's Orders to Discuss Important Matters</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Three thousand dispersed soldiers of the  19th Route Army have arrived in Guangzhou and are temporarily stationed in Huangpu. Chen Jitang has decided to incorporate them and allocate them to various units for replenishment. Guangdong has decided to hand Longyan back to the Central Army for defense, while western Fujian will still be the responsibility of the Guangdong Army. Only the Third Brigade will be transferred back to the Guangdong border for training. Cai Tingkai will remain in Shantou and will come to Hong Kong within a few days before transferring to his ancestral home in Luoding for a long-term stay. It is reported that Li Jishen is now in Macau, and Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai are still in Hong Kong. It is reported that the Southwest will issue a second declaration on the current situation. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hu Mulan took a car to the provincial capital on the afternoon of the 17th on her father's orders to discuss important matters. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Deng Longguang returned to Huiyang on the 17th, and Yu Hanmou returned to his ancestral home from the provincial capital on the 17th and will return to Jiangxi in a week. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The 7th Route Army Continues to Pass Through Xuzhou and Head West</h3>
<p>The General Headquarters Will Also Move North</p>
<p>Commander Chen Pei Talks After Passing Through Xuzhou</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Chen Pei unit of the 7th Route Army continued to pass through Xuzhou and head west on the 16th, arriving at Bianliang to garrison. Chen passed through Xuzhou at 8:00 PM and told reporters that the 4th Division of the 7th Army was ordered to be stationed in the area of Guibianbengzheng, and the General Headquarters will also move north to facilitate training. The former 19th Route Army was originally a well-trained army. After this setback, the military strength was fortunately not lost. Once trained, it will surely become an elite force again. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The 19th Route Army passed through Xuzhou from Pukou on six trains on the 16th and was transported westward in succession. The 78th Division was stationed in Guide, and the 60th Division was stationed in Bianliang. Chen Pei, the commander of the 60th Division, passed through Xuzhou with three regiments of soldiers on the evening of the 16th and told reporters that the lower-level officers of the 19th Route Army understood the righteousness and did not want to be tools for Chen Mingshu's rebellion. Therefore, the resolution was rapid. Otherwise, both sides would have been hurt, and it would not have been so smooth. Now the reorganization is complete. The 60th and 78th Divisions are stationed in Henan and will be supplemented by Liu Zhi. They will be reorganized and will still become an elite force. Mao Weishou and Zhang Yan, the deputy commanders, will come north soon, but the location of their residence is undecided. Cai Tingkai has withdrawn from the army. Shen Guanghan and Qu Shounian have gone abroad. Currently, eight out of ten parts of the army have submitted to the Central Government. The remnants of the Longyan army have been incorporated by Chen Jitang. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yellow River Ice Melts and Water Rises</h3>
<p>Ice Blocks Knock Down Wooden Piles in Many Places</p>
<p>Dam Blocking Project Cannot Proceed</p>
<p>(Jinan) The ice in the Yellow River began to melt gradually from Jiyang on the evening of the 16th. It refroze at Weijiakou, causing the water at Scorpion Bay to rise sharply by 2.73 meters, exceeding the highest flood level by 0.013 meters, which is very dangerous. River workers and soldiers worked all night to protect the area, and the lights shone like daylight. More than 3 zhang (a Chinese unit of length) of the ladder dam was washed away. Fortunately, the ice discharged through the broken area, and the downstream also continued to melt, and the water began to fall, and the engineering situation stabilized. At that time, Zhao Jiaba in Huimin also experienced ice congestion, and the water rose by 3 meters, but then the ice poured down, and the water fell again. This afternoon, the ice has melted to a place 20 li below Lijin, only 100 li from the estuary. If the weather does not turn cold, it can be completely opened in a day or two, and the ice flood can be safely passed. The water at Luokou is now rising by 0.016 meters, with a water level of 28.43 meters. In addition, two-thirds of the Yellow River Shitou Zhuang dam blocking project had been completed, but the newly built dam has been leaking and unable to be protected, and most of the piles that have been driven have been knocked down by ice blocks, making it impossible to proceed with the dam blocking. The project has been suspended, but piles are still being driven to resist the ice blocks. The dam cannot be blocked again until the whole river ice melts. The disaster areas in Hebei and Shandong will have no day to escape the danger. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee passed a disaster relief fund of 500,000 yuan, of which 300,000 yuan was allocated to Hebei, Shandong, and Henan for disaster relief and 200,000 yuan for work relief. This province can get 100,000 yuan to run spring relief. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As the Yellow River ice melted and ice blocks flowed downstream, the Li Duanliu Dam and other places in Fengloukou, southern Hebei, were destroyed by the impact of wooden piles and iron rails. The river water continued to rise, and Sun Qingze, director of the Yellow River River Affairs Bureau, urgently telegraphed the Construction Department on the 14th and 15th to raise funds for rescue.

<h3>Weng Wenhao's Condition Still Critical</h3>
<p>Under Treatment at Kwong Chi Hospital in Hangzhou</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) After Weng Wenhao was transferred to Kwong Chi Hospital in Hangzhou, his fever was slightly higher in the morning. Fragments of his skull had pierced his brain. Niu Huilin examined him at 10:00 AM, but because Weng's body was too weak and he had lost too much blood, he refused to perform surgery. He administered a small amount of saline and glucose intravenously. Weng's daughter and son-in-law arrived in Hangzhou in the afternoon. At 4:00 PM, he spoke a few words. His condition was better in the evening, but he was still unconscious and had not emerged from danger. At 7:00 PM in the evening, Zhang Shouyong arranged for a German doctor to come to Hangzhou for consultation. (Seventeenth-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Weng Wenhao, Director of the Geological Survey of the Academia Sinica and a famous international scholar, yesterday (the 16th) traveled from Nanjing to Hangzhou with a colleague surnamed Wang in a hired small chartered car along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway. At noon, after passing Biao Xing, Wang disembarked to investigate the Changxing coal mine disaster, leaving Weng to travel alone to Hangzhou. At 3:00 PM, while passing Qianjin in Wuxing, the driver inadvertently crashed the car's front into the iron railing of Yang Bridge before reaching Daixi Station. The engine exploded, and the car overturned, causing Weng and another driver to strike their heads directly forward, resulting in severe injuries and unconsciousness. Around 4:00 PM, the last train from Hangzhou to Kaihu passed by and discovered the accident. Weng and the others were helped onto the train to be transported to Hangzhou for treatment. However, the train reached Sanqiaobu, and Weng had fainted several times, his life in danger. He was taken to the nearby Wukang County Hospital for treatment. Weng still could not regain consciousness. Fortunately, the driver's injuries were minor, and he was able to speak, stating that Weng was the Secretary-General of the National Defense Design Council. The county magistrate, Yu Jinglun, personally came to Hangzhou to invite a doctor from Kwong Chi Hospital. Chen Bulei, the Provincial Director of Education, was a fellow villager of Weng from Cixi. Upon receiving the news, he not only requested a famous doctor to rush by car to provide emergency treatment overnight but also telegraphed Dr. Niu Huilin in Shanghai to come to Hangzhou for treatment. The doctors arrived after 12:00 AM that night. Upon examination, Weng's pulse was 108, and his body temperature was 35 degrees Celsius. He had a laceration above his left eyebrow, injuries to his forehead, nose, and a split lip. Although his injuries were severe, they were not life-threatening. After a little over an hour, Weng and the driver were transported from Wukang to Hangzhou by car, arriving at Kwong Chi Hospital at 3:00 AM. This morning (the 17th), Chen Bulei and provincial government officials and acquaintances of Weng visited him one after another. (Seventeenth-day special dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Prospect of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Conference</h3>
<p>According to foreign news, the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Conference held a preliminary meeting on the 14th of this month at the British Government's Department of Commerce in London. In addition to representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors of both countries, government-designated representatives attended the meeting as observers. It is reported that the main purpose of the meeting is to seek a satisfactory solution to the issue of commercial competition between the two countries. In other words, it is to discuss how to peacefully divide the world market. Japan is the most developed industrial country in the Far East, and Britain's influence in the Far East is also deeply rooted. The outcome of this conference will have a significant impact on the development of the Far Eastern market. It is safe to say that at a time when the economic war between Britain and Japan is intensifying, the sudden negotiation of an overseas market compromise movement is of great significance.</p>
<p>The close relationship between Britain and Japan has a long history. Before the First World War, due to the open and secret struggles between Britain and Tsarist Russia on the world stage, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance emerged. After the end of the Great War, as Japan's power gradually increased, Britain, in order to avoid the deterioration of its relations with the United States in the Far East, abolished the alliance. The Washington Naval Treaty set the ratio of capital ships for the British, American, and Japanese navies at 5, 5, and 3, and the relationship between Britain and Japan was no longer as harmonious as before. Over the past decade, the Japanese have been conserving their energy and vigorously developing their military. Recently, they have occupied Manchuria, coveted North China, and advocated the Monroe Doctrine of Asia, claiming to be the masters of the Far East. This has shaken the foundation of British power in the Far East. Not only that, but Japan has also taken advantage of the current development of its national strength to dump its cheap goods in various countries, almost everywhere conflicting with British goods and capital. Even in important British colonial markets such as India, it has engaged in ruthless competition, causing significant blows to British commerce. As a result, the relationship between Britain and Japan has become increasingly tense. For the past two or three years, the British have certainly wanted to thoroughly coordinate with Japan. However, the economic interests of Britain and Japan are intertwined, and even with the success of the Siram Conference in regulating the British and Japanese markets in India, there is still a need for London negotiations to promote cooperation in the world market.</p>
<p>Britain is a country with vast colonies, but internal unity is becoming increasingly fragmented. The rule of the London government is gradually feeling unsustainable. Therefore, the entire diplomatic policy of the British Empire, in addition to maintaining overseas sales and investment markets, must also take into account the situation of various colonies. Based on this principle, not only in India does it seek to maintain mutually beneficial coordination with Japan by compromising, but also for its entire overseas market, it is willing to open up within the possible scope to allow the Japanese to share a portion. However, the Japanese are not willing to accept such British generosity, believing that the coordination between the two countries should be limited to the British Empire, implying that the markets outside Britain, such as South America, China, and small European countries, still have the energy to compete for dominance. Therefore, although the London talks are currently underway, there are many hidden reefs ahead. We, as observers in a third-party position, believe that the establishment of a compromise between Britain and Japan to divide the market is unlikely. The cunning and calculating British still have the remaining strength to struggle.</p>
<h3>The Entire US Navy Will Still Be Concentrated in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Will Return After Atlantic Exercises</p>
<p>Twelve New Ships Join the Fleet</p>
<p>(Washington) According to an announcement today by US Fleet Commander Admiral Sellers, the entire US fleet, including the twelve newly added ships, will sail back to the Pacific after conducting exercises in the Atlantic this summer. Recent reports suggested that the reconnaissance fleet would remain stationed in the Atlantic after this summer's exercises, but this statement is no longer valid. The reconnaissance fleet has traditionally been stationed in the Atlantic, while the battle fleet has been stationed in the Pacific. Until two years ago, due to the instability in the Far East, the reconnaissance fleet was transferred to the West Coast. Admiral Sellers stated today that he has received orders that the newly added ships must accompany the entire fleet to the Pacific, including three new battleships, five new heavy cruisers, one new aircraft carrier, two new destroyers, and two new submarines.

<h3>Britain Does Not Recognize the Puppet State</h3>
<p>League of Nations Publishes British Government Documents</p>
<p>Postal Issue Submitted to Committee</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British government's unwillingness to take any action that implies recognition of the existing political situation in Manchuria is evident in a letter dated January 8th. The British government's letter included a letter from Fujiwara, Director of Postal Affairs in Changchun, dated September 16, 1933, requesting that Britain provide statistics in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Postal Union to settle transit fees for mail passing through (Manchukuo). The British government has requested the League of Nations to submit this matter to the Advisory Committee established on February 24, 1933, in order to clearly define the scope of the de facto relationship allowed between foreign post offices and Manchukuo post offices without involving recognition of the current system in Manchuria. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol has now convened the Advisory Committee to consider this matter on May 14th. This Advisory Committee was established to advise the League of Nations Assembly and to assist the Assembly in supervising the implementation of resolutions passed by the League of Nations Assembly regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Seventeenth-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today focused on the dispute between the British and (Manchukuo) post offices. The (Manchukuo) post office transmits British mail, and the British post office also transmits mail from (Manchukuo). This has been the practice for some time. However, (Manchukuo) recently requested the British post office to fill out certain necessary statistics under the Postal Union, so the British government has requested the League of Nations to determine the extent to which relations can be established with the (Manchukuo) post office without involving recognition of (Manchukuo). It seems that (Manchukuo) wants to use this as a test case to gain recognition at least in postal matters. (Seventeenth-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Disarmament Talks</h3>
<p>Doumergue Hosts Eden</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Doumergue is scheduled to host British Lord Privy Seal Eden at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. Anglo-French talks on disarmament are scheduled to begin after the banquet this afternoon. This morning at 11:45 AM, Doumergue and ministers without portfolio Herriot and Théodore, as well as the ministers of the various defense departments, held a meeting in the Prime Minister's office. Prior to this, Doumergue had also held lengthy consultations with Foreign Minister Barthou, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger, and the French representative to the Disarmament Conference, Massigli. (Seventeenth-day Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon gave a speech in Brighton today, mentioning the issue of disarmament and raising a question: What is the point of making proposals that great powers should disarm to the level of Germany, knowing full well that the great powers cannot accept them? Can the United States or Japan agree to it? If countries can reach an agreement to limit armaments, it will mark a new era in world history. If efforts in this regard fail, the world will once again fall into an unrestrained competition in the manufacture and deployment of war equipment, the consequences of which are beyond our prediction. (Sixteenth-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Under-Secretary of State for Air Sassoon gave a speech at the Oxford Conservative Association today, advocating for the development of the British Air Force in clear terms. He stated that Britain only has 200 military aircraft for frontline combat, while the closest neighboring country has 997. Given the current situation in Europe, this situation is absolutely unacceptable. Britain's unilateral disarmament has reached its limit, and beyond this limit, it will be detrimental to national security. International peace cannot be guaranteed for the long term. If Britain mistakenly believes that the current state of peace is sustainable for the long term, danger will arise. In this situation, Britain should demand equality in air forces among all countries, and the way to achieve equality is to reduce the air forces of other countries to the same level as the British Air Force. As for military aviation, if it is abolished, the airspace over the territory will be controlled by countries with strong civil aviation, which is unacceptable to Britain.

<h3>US Congressmen Propose Treasury to Buy Silver</h3>
<p>London Silver Market Remains Firm</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressman Scrugham has introduced a bill in the House of Representatives proposing that the Treasury Department purchase at least 25 million ounces of silver per month for six months, and then continue to purchase 10 million ounces per month until the total amount of silver purchased reaches 1 billion ounces, or the gold-silver ratio reaches 16 to 1. The bill stipulates that if prices exceed the prices on January 1, 1926, the monthly purchase of silver can be reduced to 4 million ounces. The bill also stipulates that silver purchases should be paid for with silver certificates, which can be redeemed for silver bars at the then-current equivalent value of gold, and the redeemed silver certificates should still be used to purchase silver. Silver-backing congressmen in the House of Representatives have decided to establish a 100-member committee, led by Fessenden, and silver-backing congressmen have issued a resolution supporting the proposal to have the Treasury Department purchase 50 million ounces per month, up to 1 billion ounces, and this proposal stipulates that silver should be purchased at market prices and paid for with silver certificates, which can be redeemed for gold in the future. (Sixteenth-day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The London silver market has been firm recently because the public believes that the US government is being swayed by silver-backing congressmen and will soon take action. The future situation is still uncertain, but it is expected that the US government will purchase large quantities of silver stored in New York at a slightly higher price than the relatively open market. The recent weakness of the US dollar is likely due to American speculators buying British pounds in order to buy forward silver. However, London's purchase of gold is also a reason for the weakness of the US dollar, as the price of gold calculated in British pounds is almost the same as that calculated in French francs, so it is no longer profitable to buy French francs or withdraw cash from the Bank of France. The French franc expresses sympathy for the US dollar and continues to decline. (Seventeenth-day Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Government is Extremely Embarrassed by the Bribery Case Involving Education Minister Hatoyama</h3>
<p>Investigative Committee Demands Explanation</p>
<p>Saitō Will Sacrifice the Education Minister to Preserve Everything</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Investigative Committee decided on the morning of the 17th to request that the two ministers, Hatoyama and Mitsuchi, attend the meeting on the 19th. The government was very embarrassed upon hearing this news and convened a cabinet meeting within the Diet at noon to discuss the issue of the Sakhalin Industrial Company to avoid discrepancies in the explanations given by Justice Minister Koyama and Education Minister Hatoyama to the committee. Although the issue does not have criminal implications in law, the fact that Hatoyama, the Education Minister, accepted bribes from a person involved in breach of trust and embezzlement, and was forced to attend the Investigative Committee under national scrutiny, is related to the dignity of the government, and its impact on the Saitō Cabinet is not insignificant. The government authorities seem to have made a major decision regarding the resignation of Education Minister Hatoyama to resolve all issues before the cabinet is affected. However, the outcome of the Investigative Committee will strengthen the momentum of all parties impeaching the current cabinet for its responsibility regarding discipline. The anti-cabinet sentiment inside and outside the House of Representatives and the House of Peers will definitely intensify. Therefore, the timing of the Education Minister's decision on his future will be the most dangerous moment for the current cabinet. (Seventeenth-day Japan Federation dispatch)</p>
<h3>Education Minister Caught in a Dilemma After Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>Saitō's Decision is Highly Noteworthy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government has stated in both houses that there was no impropriety in the Taiwan Bank incident regarding discipline, but it is feared that the Investigative Committee will not be able to obtain confirmation no matter how it investigates. However, the problem is that the money exchanged between Fujita, Managing Director of the Sakhalin Industrial Company, and Education Minister Hatoyama is recorded in the prosecutor's office, so there is nothing to be done. If the Diet pursues the responsibility for political morality in past events, then in addition to the Taiwan Bank issue, it will be the personal issue of Education Minister Hatoyama. Therefore, it will secretly encourage Education Minister Hatoyama's voluntary resignation to prevent a political crisis. If Education Minister Hatoyama avoids it, how will he be dealt with? Therefore, Prime Minister Saitō's decision is highly noteworthy. (Seventeenth-day Electrical Communication dispatch)</p>
<h3>Investigative Committee to Begin Investigation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Requests Attendance of Education Minister and Minister of Railways</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The preliminary investigation meeting regarding Representative Okamoto Ichiki will convene at 10:00 AM in Japan. Shimada Toshio will serve as chairman. After determining the scope of the investigation, the investigation will proceed. The Nationalist League and the Constitutional Democratic Party are advocating that, in addition to Representative Okamoto, all necessary figures such as Education Minister Hatoyama, Minister of Railways Mitsuchi, and Railway Secretary General Yoneda should be questioned and thoroughly investigated. The atmosphere is already extremely tense before the meeting, and there are bound to be many waves in the future. (Seventeenth-day Electrical Communication dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Investigative Committee on the 19th, Okamoto Ichiki and Etō Genkurō will explain the contents of the disclosures of political scandals, and then Education Minister Hatoyama and Minister of Railways Mitsuchi will be asked to clarify their positions. Whether the Investigative Committee can dispel doubts about the issue of discipline that day, or whether any unknown issues will be exposed to everyone's eyes, the public's attention is focused on the Investigative Committee on the 19th. (Seventeenth-day Japan Federation dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Investigative Committee's attitude toward the internal strife of the Seiyūkai and Representative Okamoto is now being emphasized by all parties. The government believes that the relationship between Education Minister Hatoyama and the breach of trust and embezzlement case of the Sakhalin Industrial Company is merely an act of providing political funds and has no criminal nature. The government appears optimistic on the surface, but even if the Investigative Committee does not believe that Education Minister Hatoyama has engaged in improper conduct, there is no conclusive evidence to dispel doubts about the Education Minister. As the head of the Ministry of Education is under suspicion and criticized by all parties, the Nationalist League will submit an emergency motion regarding the Education Minister at the House of Representatives meeting on the 17th. Although it can be rejected by the majority, such an atmosphere in the House of Representatives will have an important impact on the House of Peers. If Education Minister Hatoyama has to decide to resign due to this issue, the political situation will become even more complicated. The Seiyūkai is paying close attention to the Education Minister's actions with a tense attitude. (Seventeenth-day Japan Federation dispatch)</p>
<h3>Internal Divisions Within the Seiyūkai Becoming Increasingly Deep</h3>
<p>Purge Issue Temporarily Cancelled</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The internal strife within the Seiyūkai is becoming increasingly deep. Members of each faction held meetings in various locations on the 16th. Former and current cabinet members from the Seiyūkai, including President Suzuki, etc., met at a restaurant in Tsukiji, but dispersed without reaching a conclusion. Other hardliners from the Suzuki faction, centered on Yasui Masazumi, the Ōkuma faction's Daidō Unity Party, and the Tokonami faction's Yamamoto faction, etc., held separate meetings to discuss countermeasures. However, the party executive committee still insisted on expelling the Ōkuma faction, and other committee members also wanted to expel Tsugumo and Nishikata. However, the Tokonami and Ōkuma factions absolutely opposed the expulsion, so a major dispute will inevitably occur when this expulsion issue is discussed at the Seiyūkai convention. The crisis of the Seiyūkai's collapse is becoming more and more serious. (Seventeenth-day Japan Federation dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Seiyūkai's Mochizuki Keisuke and Shimada Toshio, both General Managers, met with Secretary-General Yamaguchi yesterday at a certain location. Regarding the issue of expelling five members, including Tsugumo Kunikazu, as a result of careful consultations, it was decided to disregard the matter on the grounds that there was no basis for such a major penalty of expulsion based solely on actions in the Diet. Therefore, the expulsion issue advocated by President Suzuki and the Hatoyama faction has been temporarily cancelled. However, if the Investigative Committee finds that Education Minister Hatoyama is not involved in the issue of discipline, but that he colluded with Okamoto Ichiki and supported him, the expulsion issue will be considered again.

<h3>Constitutional Democratic Party Still Does Not Advocate for Overthrowing the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Nationalist League Actively Engaged</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kiyose Ichirō of the Nationalist League met with executives of the Constitutional Democratic Party in the Diet at 5:00 PM yesterday. As a result of the discussion about the scope of the investigation by the Okamoto Ichiki Investigative Committee, both parties insisted that, in addition to the issue of the disposal of shares held by Hatoyama, which is related to Education Minister Hatoyama, the issue of receiving 50,000 yen from the Sakhalin Industrial Company should also be thoroughly investigated. At this time, Kiyose asked the executives of the Constitutional Democratic Party about the trend of this issue and what the attitude and opinions of the party were regarding the fate of the current cabinet. Raifu Mokukeiichi, representing the Constitutional Democratic Party, expressed his determination, saying that the issue of discipline was not so serious as to be a matter of the fate of the cabinet. Furthermore, the Nationalist League will submit an emergency motion to the plenary session today, stating that the Sakhalin Industrial Company should also be entrusted to the Investigative Committee. If this motion passes, its trend will be very significant. (Seventeenth-day Electrical Communication dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The attitude of the House of Peers regarding the issue of discipline has worsened due to the Hatoyama incident. On the one hand, the internal strife within the Seiyūkai has gradually expanded, and the movement to overthrow the cabinet is progressing both inside and outside the Diet. The issue is what attitude the heads of the government, such as Prime Minister Saitō, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Home Minister Yamamoto, will take towards Education Minister Hatoyama. It so happened that the Prime Minister was ill, and no consultations were held between Takahashi and Yamamoto, so the government has not yet expressed a concrete opinion on this matter. However, many observers surrounding the situation are pessimistic about the government's side, so the day when the Prime Minister's illness is fully recovered may be the most chaotic period of the political situation.

<h3>Etō and Two Others Accuse Education Minister Hatoyama</h3>
<p>Hatoyama Expresses No Intention to Resign</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Etō Genkurō, Okamoto Ichiki, and Koike Shirō accused Education Minister Hatoyama of the Sakhalin Industrial issue today at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office. (Seventeenth-day Electrical Communication dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hatoyama told reporters that he heard that the Investigative Committee was requesting him to attend, and he would of course attend the meeting to explain the Sakhalin Industrial issue and his conduct to clarify the truth. He had received money from Fujita Yoshisaburō, the president of the Sakhalin Industrial Company, which was entirely Fujita's clean property. Fujita and he were classmates, and since he had no property and entered the political world, he often received assistance from friends, but he had no improper conduct, so he had no intention of resigning. When Prime Minister Saitō recovers from his illness and comes to the Diet, he will explain the truth in front of all the cabinet members, express his beliefs, and state that he has no intention of resigning.

<h3>New Commercial Treaty Signed: England and Russia Shake Hands Joyfully</h3>
<p>Promotes Trade Balance Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(London) No speeches were given at the signing of the Anglo-Russian commercial treaty. After the signing, British cabinet members shook hands joyfully with the Russian signatories. Regarding measures to balance exports and imports in 1938, one noteworthy point is that in 1933, Britain purchased a total of £17.5 million worth of Russian goods, while Russia purchased only £4.25 million worth of British goods. The treaty does not include any debt provisions, so it is generally regarded as temporary in nature. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Izvestia commented on the Anglo-Soviet commercial treaty, stating, "This agreement is the result of long-term negotiations and will undoubtedly satisfy those who wish to see the normal development and consolidation of Soviet-British economic relations. This commercial treaty contains real allowances for a substantial expansion of Soviet-British economic relations. However, we must understand that these allowances can only produce practical results under favorable conditions in the general relations between the two countries, and with the goodwill of both sides to act as a solid and correct foundation for these relations." The newspaper pointed out that Soviet-British trade had suffered serious setbacks in the past, but there is absolutely no conflict between the interests of the British national economy and the interests of the Soviet national economy. In the past, there have been many obstacles and misunderstandings in the path of normal development of Soviet-British commercial relations. The signing of this treaty will eliminate them. The newspaper concluded, "Soviet public opinion will certainly be satisfied with the signing of this treaty, because we all hope that this treaty will not only restore the foundation for the solid and normal development of Soviet-British commercial relations, but also serve as a pivot for the transformation of the entire Soviet-British relationship. This improvement is entirely in line with the wishes expressed by the Soviet government." (TASS, 17th)</p>
<h3>England and France to Open Negotiations</h3>

<h3>Will France Reduce Parity?</h3>

<h3>Socialist Leader Flees to Czechoslovakia: The Great Powers Clear Up Matters Regarding Austria</h3>
<p>Italy Intends to Issue Declaration to Aid Austrian Independence</p>
<p>England and France Have Different Views on the Method</p>
<p>Vienna Although the defeated Socialist Party is still resisting the government with guerrilla tactics, it is nothing more than embers after a great fire. More than 2,000 party members are now being detained for trial.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Paris, the French capital is now very concerned about the possible developments in Austria. Diplomats from France, England, Italy, and Czechoslovakia actively consulted on this issue yesterday. It is reported that the governments of France, England, and Italy intend to issue a joint declaration stating their determination to maintain Austria's independence. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Senate resolved to urge the government to assume the obligations of the Treaty of Versailles to protect Austria's independence, and to request a joint response to the appeal of Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss to convene a League of Nations meeting as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the same time, a Reuters correspondent in Rome also telegraphed that the Italian government may request the League of Nations to investigate whether Czechoslovakia was involved in the Austrian turmoil, but this application will only be made after Chancellor Dollfuss implements his determination to resolve the Austrian issue through the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The Italian government has proposed that the three countries, England, France, and Italy, simultaneously issue communiqués in their respective capitals, announcing that the three countries share the desire to respect Austria's independence and territorial integrity. Italy made this suggestion to prevent rumors from arising that the three countries have differing opinions on the fundamental principles of this matter. It is noted that Chancellor Dollfuss previously announced that Austria intended to appeal to the League of Nations, and after England, France, and Italy replied, it was discovered that their opinions were not consistent. Italy does not particularly approve of this appeal. Parisian sources believe that even if the three countries issue a declaration respecting Austria's independence and territorial integrity, Austria may still seek assistance from the League of Nations at any time. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government drafted a declaration stating that if Austria is subject to foreign interference, England, France, and Italy would guarantee its independence and territorial integrity. It asked England and France to join in order to issue it jointly. England and France have refused because this move implies supporting Dollfuss's policies. It is reported that the British government refused this request because Prime Minister MacDonald was angered by Dollfuss's domestic policies. If England is required to join, there must be a statement on this point. It is reported that France holds the same attitude. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This dispatch received a Parisian telegram that French Foreign Minister Barthou's attempt to contact the British, Italian, and Czech governments to jointly issue a declaration to maintain Austria's independence has failed. The negotiations that Barthou conducted with the ambassadors and ministers of those countries in Paris broke down at midnight. Berlin newspapers stated that British Minister Eden arrived in Paris last night. It is claimed that Britain has no intention of supporting France's proposal because this move is of no practical help and will only provoke Germany. Italy had previously proposed that the powers maintain Austria's independence by force, but this was also blocked by the British ambassador because Britain does not want to be drawn into a whirlpool that could cause conflict on the European continent. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Independence: An Element of European Equilibrium</h3>
<p>French Parliament Resolves to Maintain the Treaty</p>
<p>England, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia Have Also Guaranteed It</p>
<p>(Paris) Recent foreign reports say that negotiations are underway between London, Paris, and Rome, with the intention that the three countries simultaneously issue a declaration recognizing the need to respect Austria's independence and territorial integrity. The negotiations could reach a result soon. This news has been confirmed today and yesterday. The proposal to issue the declaration originated in Rome, and the attitudes of various countries are related to the recent events in Austria. Although the countries are paying close attention to Austria's fate, they inevitably hesitated slightly regarding the actions to be taken. However, since the recent uprisings of the Socialist Party in Vienna and Linz, the countries have no longer hesitated. The Austrian government had previously sent the governments of England, France, and Italy case files regarding the German National Socialist Party's disturbances in Austria, and at the same time declared that Austria intended to seek justice from the League of Nations. The three governments have replied to Austria's communication. The three governments, in principle, expressed sympathy for Austria, but their opinions on the methods to protect Austria's independence differed greatly. Italy continued to express doubts about seeking justice from the League of Nations. The wording of the three countries' replies was different, and there was concern that it would be exploited by others if it were published in the future. Therefore, the Roman government proposed that the three governments, in completely identical language, simultaneously issue declarations in the three capitals, expressing the three countries' shared desire to guarantee Austria's independence and territorial integrity. After this expression, the saying that maintaining Austria's independence is only a secondary matter for the countries can be disproved. This declaration will also not hinder Austria's seeking justice from the League of Nations. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held an extraordinary meeting to study the Austrian events and unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to guarantee Austria's independence in order to maintain peace. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate also believes that Austria's independence and territorial integrity are necessary conditions for maintaining peace and preserving the European equilibrium. The peace treaty guarantees it, and the protocol signed by England, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia in October 1932 also recognized that Austria should be protected, but its protection should be guided by the League of Nations and carried out within the scope of the League of Nations. No country may obtain special and unilateral benefits by protecting Austria. (Note: On July 15, 1932, England, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia signed a protocol stipulating that Austria should receive international financial assistance. It was discussed by the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations on October 13 of that year.) Therefore, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously believes that if Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss has appealed, then the countries that co-signed the protocol should promptly find ways to convene the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations in order to examine Austria's lawsuit and determine whether it is reasonable. The countries should also take the measures that the Executive Yuan may deem appropriate. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hitler States Germany Has No Connection to the Austrian Turmoil</h3>
<p>Austrian Workers Will Inevitably Turn to National Socialism</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail's Berlin correspondent interviewed German Chancellor Hitler and published his remarks. According to Hitler, the recently signed German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact has absolutely no effect against the Soviet Union. He also said that the three Bulgarian Communist Party members who were arrested on suspicion of arson in the German Reichstag fire and subsequently acquitted by the Leipzig court will soon be released. When mentioning the Austrian events, he strongly denied that German National Socialist Party members were involved in the recent Austrian turmoil, and said that the German revolution had no riots or bloodshed, which was very different from the Austrian turmoil. Finally, he said that Austrian workers will inevitably turn to National Socialism in the future because the Austrian government has taken violent measures against the workers, which is bound to cause such a reaction.

<h3>Austrian Government Reorganized: Fascist Faction Takes the Stage</h3>
<p>Five Socialists Hanged</p>
<p>Cabinet Orders Partial Lifting of Martial Law</p>
<p>Denies Hundreds of Women and Children Died</p>
<p>Vienna At 8:20 last night, the Vienna Provisional Court again announced the death penalty for five people, who were sent to the gallows eleven minutes later. However, six other Socialist Party members, who were scheduled to be executed at midnight, were suddenly granted amnesty in the last few minutes.</p>
<p>This morning, the Cabinet issued an order that martial law be lifted in all provinces except Vienna, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, and Styria.</p>
<p>At 1:30 in the morning, the Cabinet decided to appoint Dr. Stummer as Minister of Social Welfare, while the incumbent Minister, Dr. Smidtz, was reassigned as Vienna Administrative Commissioner and Minister without Portfolio. This change is very significant because the new Minister of Social Welfare is recommended by the Austrian Fascist Heimwehr.</p>
<p>The Cabinet also decided to remove Socialist Party members from all parts of the country, so it ordered that all personnel invested or appointed by the Socialist Party be dismissed. This move will have a great impact because the newly appointed officials may dismiss civil servants affiliated with the Socialist Party.</p>
<p>The rumor in a certain foreign newspaper that hundreds of women and children were killed when the Vienna army bombarded is referred to here as false propaganda. It is said that a total of 137 civilians died in Vienna, of whom only nine were women and two were young children. The government is now trying to provide relief to the families of all innocent victims. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Vienna The Austrian Cabinet met from yesterday afternoon until 1:00 a.m. and then issued an order to lift martial law immediately in the provinces of Tyrol and Burgenland. Vienna, Upper Austria, Lower Austria, and Styria will also be lifted as soon as possible. The Cabinet also carried out a partial reorganization at the same time, appointing Stummer as Minister of Social Affairs, and the original Minister of the Department, Schmidtz, was reassigned to Minister without Portfolio. The Cabinet also ordered the cancellation of the qualifications of Socialist members of parliament and the dissolution of the Vienna Labor Bank. So far, seven people have been executed, and it is said that many more will be sentenced. The head of the Information Bureau, Lordwick, told foreign reporters that the rebellion has now been quelled. The recent turmoil has suddenly caused the Austrian royalists to show their faces. They declared that if Emperor Wilhelm of Germany had not been abolished in 1918, there would be no such incidents today. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Vienna The government has recently ordered the dissolution of twelve Socialist Party organizations. Chancellor Dollfuss had previously issued a declaration to Socialist Party traitors, saying that traitors who handed over their weapons to the police would be granted amnesty. As of now, the traitors have handed over 73 machine guns, 3,276 rifles, 3,708 pistols, 204,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, 59,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition, and many hand grenades.

<h3>Socialist Party Personnel Flee After Defeat: The Course of Escape</h3>
<p>Underground Secret Passages in Vienna Lead to Sewers</p>
<p>Prominent Leaders Flee to Czechoslovakia One After Another</p>
<p>Vienna The Vienna Socialist Party apparently prepared a route for escape after failure when they launched their uprising, otherwise there would have been more deaths in this battle. Now, it has been found that the workers' residences destroyed by government artillery fire all have secret underground passages connecting to Vienna's underground sewers, which are as dense as a honeycomb. The defeated party members can walk through the sewers to a place farther from the battlefield and safely ascend to the ground through holes.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Prague, Austrian Socialist Party leaders Bauer and Dezh, after being forced to flee to Czechoslovakia, are now planning to move the headquarters of the Austrian Social Democratic Party to Brno. At the same time, a new Executive Committee has been organized in Vienna, and the matter is extremely confidential because if the committee members are detected by the authorities, they risk long-term imprisonment or even the death penalty. A total of 63 Austrian Socialists have fled to Czechoslovakia, and the authorities have confiscated their weapons and sent them to Brno. Mr. Dezh was injured in the fighting on February 13, the second day of the uprising, and is now staying in a sanatorium in Bratislava. Although he was injured, he walked all the way when he fled into Czechoslovakia, taking four hours to reach a safe place. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>American Socialist Party Protests Against Austrian Government</h3>
<p>Bloodshed Occurs During Gathering</p>
<p>(New York) Today, 20,000 Socialist Party members gathered in Madison Avenue Park for a meeting to oppose the Austrian oppression of the Socialist Party. A conflict suddenly arose, national flags were torn, and demonstrators picked up objects at hand to use as weapons. Chairs flew around, and there was a melee. Three women and nine men were beaten and injured, including two news photographers. One man was stabbed and seriously injured. It is now believed that about several hundred people suffered minor injuries. The situation reached its climax when 5,000 Communists tried to occupy the podium. There were only 170 police officers on duty at the scene, and they did not carry batons. The Mayor of New York and the Vice President of the Labor Federation had planned to attend the speech, but the riots had already broken out before they arrived. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary The Executive Committee of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party issued a declaration expressing solidarity with the Austrian Socialist Party. In addition, Congressman Pukingel, on behalf of the Socialist Party caucus in the House of Representatives, requested the Hungarian government to allow Austrian Socialist Party members the right to seek refuge in Hungary (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Situation in Spain</h3>
<p>Fascist Factions Merge</p>
<p>Political Turmoil Will Inevitably Erupt Sooner or Later</p>
<p>Madrid Due to the unstable general situation, two Spanish Fascist factions have now merged into one and issued a joint declaration stating that the Fascist Party's position is different from that of the right-wing parties. It also lists the party platform as follows: (1) National unity; (2) Direct action; (3) Opposition to Marxism; (4) Opposition to parliamentarianism; (5) Economic revolution. Although the Spanish Cabinet denies the rumors of infighting among cabinet members, it is generally felt that the differences of opinion between the extreme factions on the right and left are too great, and a cabinet crisis will inevitably occur sooner or later. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid Two thousand miners in the Benamaher regional mines went on strike to protest the decision of a certain mine factory in the Shete region to increase working hours. In addition, 500 dockworkers in Madrid were fired, and the workers therefore announced a general strike this morning. Although the leader of the general strike of construction workers has been released after being arrested, the strike has not yet ended. However, the general public is quite optimistic, believing that the striking workers will all be able to return to work uniformly on Monday. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Nearly a Thousand People Killed or Injured in Austrian Turmoil</h3>
<p>Vienna According to official estimates, a total of 239 people were killed and 658 injured in the country in this turmoil.

Of the 658 injured, soldiers accounted for 319 and civilians accounted for 339. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>Newly Appointed Envoy to Portugal Zhang Xinhai Presents Credentials</h3>

<p>Will Use Lisbon Archives to Elucidate Chinese Culture</p>
<p>Lisbon Correspondence: Zhang Xinhai, Ph.D., the newly appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the National Government to Portugal, set sail from Shanghai last November and arrived in Lisbon in mid-December. On the afternoon of the twenty-seventh of that month, he presented his credentials to the Portuguese President. The Chief of Protocol of the Presidential Palace, Band Leit de Castro, led a cavalry escort to the Chinese Legation to accompany Envoy Zhang in the Presidential Palace's ceremonial carriage to the Palace. Envoy Zhang, accompanied by Secretary Wu Zhaohuan and Yang Xianzeng, entered to meet the Portuguese President, who paid his respects. Envoy Zhang then presented his credentials and read his credentials speech. After the Portuguese President read his response, he invited Envoy Zhang to sit for a while in his private office. After a long conversation, Envoy Zhang took his leave. Envoy Zhang then visited the diplomatic corps stationed in Portugal and met with all the envoys, especially the American envoy, who was very cordial. According to custom, a newly appointed envoy's initial meeting with other envoys is limited to a few words of greeting and does not involve lengthy conversations. This time, when Envoy Zhang first met the American envoy to Portugal, the American envoy specially arranged refreshments to entertain him, and his wife and daughter also sat with them, showing great cordiality, as if they were old friends. The American envoy also discussed with Dr. Zhang the richness of the Lisbon archives, which could be used for cultural reference between China and Portugal. Dr. Zhang is a scholar of Western literature. When he studied in the United States, his works were already well-known. The American envoy had long heard of his name, so upon meeting him, he engaged in a long conversation. Envoy Zhang has always been interested in anecdotes. Hearing the American envoy's words, he plans to use the Lisbon archives to further study the history of Sino-Portuguese relations during the late Ming Dynasty in order to elucidate Chinese culture, which has long been disseminated in the Atlantic countries. Portuguese Foreign Minister Medes and Undersecretary Santana, are both Portuguese scholars. Many members of the diplomatic corps in Portugal are also accomplished scholars. After meeting Envoy Zhang, they were in agreement and had very harmonious relations, which should have a considerable effect on future diplomatic relations.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Army Fully Attacks Ningxia</h3>
<p>Yan Xishan Sends Troops to Assist in the Attack on Sun's Troops</p>
<p>The Elite of Sun's Troops is Almost Entirely Lost</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Ningxia war situation has not yet developed at present. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sun's Army Strategy: Sun Dianying has now returned to Shizuishan from Baofeng, still claiming to advance westward, leading his troops to besiege the provincial capital of Ningxia. However, fearing air raids, they move during the night and hide during the day. The Ningxia army's defenses are extremely strict, and Sun's army is not easily successful. Currently, Sun is at the end of his rope and lacks food, so he convened his subordinate generals in Shizuishan to discuss strategy. It was decided to launch a final fierce attack on Ningxia with all forces. If they occupy Ningxia, then Pingluo will fall without being attacked. However, food is lacking and this plan must be completed in the shortest possible time, otherwise the soldiers may desert. Therefore, a second step was decided: if the attack on the suburbs of Ningxia is not smooth, then they will lead the entire army around to Guyuan and Liangzhou to seek a way out. This is the reason for the Sun's army's two fierce attacks on the provincial capital of Ningxia in recent days.</p>
<p>Five Provinces Encirclement: Regarding the method of the five provinces encircling and suppressing Sun's army, although the Military Affairs Commission has ordered Jin, Sui, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces to prepare, it has not been implemented in practice. The crux of the matter lies in whether Shanxi will actually send troops to encircle and suppress. Now Yan has telegraphed the Ping Military Affairs Commission, saying that he has ordered the troops of Jin and Sui provinces to concentrate in the Wulin area on the twentieth of this month, and appointed Xu Yongchang and Fu Zuoyi as plenipotentiaries to go to Beiping for consultation. On the fourteenth, Fu Zuoyi telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission to report that he would go to Hebiancun to meet Yan and ask for instructions. The Military Affairs Commission believes that the movement of troops should be swift, and urgently telegraphed Xu and Fu to come to Beiping quickly to plan everything. They then received a reply that they would leave Bing by car together on the fifteenth at noon. It is heard that Yan has agreed to transfer three divisions and one independent brigade from Jin and Sui provinces to encircle and suppress Sun's troops, including Zhao Chengsui's cavalry division, Wang Jingguo and Fu Zuoyi's two infantry divisions, and Feng Yuxi's independent brigade, and has set a deadline of the twentieth of this month for them to concentrate in the Wulin area of ​​western Sui. Once Xu and Fu arrive in Beiping and agree on specific measures with the Military Affairs Commission, the troops from all directions will depart from western Sui. After Xu and Fu arrive in Beiping, they will discuss how to expedite the dispatch of troops and to what extent they will pursue and suppress Sun's army after the dispatch of troops. Therefore, Xu's mission to Beiping this time is very important.</p>
<p>The Beiping Military Affairs Commission will no longer issue a punitive order for the five provinces to encircle and suppress Sun's troops. The entire Guan Division stationed in the suburbs of Ping, as well as a cavalry regiment and an artillery regiment of the Liu Division, will also be ordered to go to Baotou. Currently, the Guan and Liu Divisions have issued a preparation mobilization order, and the soldiers' leather clothing has been made and the vehicles have also been prepared. A part will be sent first in the coming days.</p>
<p>Recent Battle Reports: In the Ningxia battle situation, although Sun's troops are currently launching a fierce attack on the provincial capital of Ningxia with all their forces, the reinforcements from various parties in Ningxia, such as Ma Bufang and Ma Buqing, have gathered one after another, and the city defenses have become more and more consolidated, and they are unanimously fighting back. Sun's army is quite unfavorable. On the fourteenth, Ma Hongkui sent an urgent telegram to the Military Affairs Commission, roughly saying (Sun's army's attack on the city is unfavorable, and has led the entire army to move westward, and the destination is unknown). He Yingqin immediately inquired from the front about the report, proving that this report was not factual, and learned that Sun's army was still besieging Pingluo and Ningxia, and there was no sign of movement. Also, recent Ningxia battle reports are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Ningxia, Eighth Telegram, according to reports, (1) The remnant troops of the Xia Brigade of the rebel army, which were surrounded by the cavalry of the two units of my Fifteenth Route □□ north of Xincheng Wangjiazhai, were resolved today after a painful annihilation of about fifty people. The remaining enemies collapsed and retreated to the Fengdengbu and Balamiao areas. (3) Today, at the time of 未時(1-3 pm), the enemy artillery fiercely bombarded the positions of the □□ Division on my left wing and the □□ Division on my right wing. Our army waited in strict formation and the enemy did not succeed. (2) The Yang Monkey's bandit unit窜擾(to disturb/disrupt) in the Yanghebu and Najiahu areas south of Ningxia, wantonly搶刦(robbed/plundered). They were痛加兜勦(fiercely encircled and suppressed) by our cavalry □ Division □□ unit and □□ Division cavalry □□ unit, and they scattered and fled. Our cavalry is still searching and annihilating.</p>
<p>(B) Ningxia, Tenth Telegram, according to reports, (1) The enemy north of Ningxia launched an attack on our entire line at dawn today. Their artillery also fiercely bombarded Xiejiazhai of my □□ Division and Dongjia and Wangjiazhai of □□ Division. Our entire line stood firmly and defended. Extending to 已時(9-11 am), taking advantage of the enemy's firepower being slightly sparse, the entire line bravely launched an attack, and immediately defeated the enemy, with dead and wounded all over the field, and occupied many fortresses. (2) The enemy also used a cavalry group, moving southwest from Fengdengbu and Balamiao along the western mountain roots, trying to disrupt the rear. They were fiercely blocked and annihilated by a unit of my cavalry □ Division and the cavalry regiment of the Fifteenth Route, and they fled northward. (3) At noon today, three airplanes flew to the Yao Fubu, Li Gangbu and 满口橋 areas, and carried out bombing of the enemy army驻地(garrison) and headquarters. Where the bombs fell, they immediately exploded, killing countless people. It is heard that Liu Yuting's rebel military headquarters was also hit.</p>
<p>(C) Ningxia, Eleventh Telegram, since Sun's army invaded Ningxia, it has besieged Pingluo without success, and then fiercely attacked the provincial capital. Both times they were defeated, with more than 6,000 casualties and more than 1,700 prisoners. The elite of the unit is almost entirely lost. Now only defeated soldiers are scattered in the villages and fortresses, like bandits. They have been resolved one by one by the combined army of the three provinces. The central air force is flying to Ningxia, led by team leader □□□□□□ and other pilots □ team, divided to Yao Fubu, Li Gangbu and 满達橋 areas, bombing enemy positions and Liu Yuting's brigade headquarters. It is heard that Liu suffered heavy injuries. After this bombing, it became even more of a collapse. The clearing of the remaining enemies should not be far away. (Fifteenth)</p>
<h3>Hankou Police Department Cracks Horse Racing Course Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Four Robbers Arrested and Stolen Money Recovered</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: On January 2 this year, a robbery case of over ten thousand yuan occurred at the Hankou International Racecourse. It has now been cracked by the Garrison Department. The two masterminds and two perpetrators have been arrested. One person was murdered by accomplices and one is at large. The cracking of this case is bizarre and tortuous. I will record the main points as follows:</p>
<p>It turned out that the bandits Wang Xianzhang and Xue Yaoting were originally soldiers, formerly under the command of Fan Zhongxiu of the Jianguo Army. Wang was a regimental commander and Xue was a battalion commander. Fan died in the battle to suppress Feng Yuxiang, and the troops dispersed. Wang and others hid in Hankou, making a living by selling morphine. They often associated with bandits. One day, they gathered at Wang's residence at No. 81 Changqing Lane in the French Concession and decided to rob the International Racecourse. Wang and Xue masterminded the plan, while Ding Yuzhai, Tian Huating, Ren Qichang, and others were responsible for carrying it out. At that time, the people of Hankou were celebrating the New Year, and the entire city was in a frenzy. The garrison troops were maintaining security in the urban area, while the International Racecourse happened to be outside the urban area, so the bandits took advantage of the opportunity to jump into a car at 5 pm on the second, when the horse racing association personnel were carrying money out, and forced them to get out of the car with guns, ordering the driver to change direction. On the way, they smashed the box and robbed 13,103 yuan in cash. The Police Department, according to the reports of the Chief of the Investigation Division Ren Benzhao, the Commander of the First Regiment of the Garrison Brigade Shen Cheng, the Director of the Hankou Public Security Bureau Chen Xizeng, and the Manager of the Racecourse Chen Youxin, successively, ordered the Investigation Division to solve the case, and offered a reward of 500 yuan, in order to recover both the people and the stolen goods. After receiving the order, the Investigation Division divided into seven groups and mobilized all personnel, but there were no signs for a long time. Later, according to a tip from an informant, Hou, a Henan man named Yang Huai Zhi and a Tian man were in the racecourse every day, and Yang was a bad person and should be responsible for this. Therefore, Yang was arrested. According to the report of the manager of the Racecourse Chen Youxin, the four robbers all spoke with a northern accent. The driver Zhou Rongye also firmly stated that the person who forced him with a gun was Yang Huai Zhi. The evidence was conclusive, and Yang could not deny it. However, although Yang was not a good person, he did not participate in this case, so it was difficult to get a real confession about the details of the case. He only said that Ding, Ren, and Xue were related. According to the confession, the Police Department arrested Guo Wenqi, Xue Yaoting, and Wang Xianzhang one after another. Wang confessed that Ding Yuzhai, Tian Huating, and Ren Qichang were all in Anlu. He heard that Ren had been murdered by Ding, Tian, and others. The Police Department sent officers to Anlu with the criminal Wang to identify and arrest them. Because Ding and others were in the garden, they went to the garden to find Ding and Tian. Ren was indeed murdered. After Ding and Tian were escorted to Hankou, they were sent to the military court for interrogation together. Combining the confessions of the criminals, it was learned that the masterminds of this case were Wang and Xue. Wang and Ren looked for partners, Xue and Ren put together guns, Ding and Tian and a bandit from Nanyang and others robbed. Afterwards, they divided the spoils in Wang's residence, one share per person and one share per gun, totaling eleven shares, each share worth 600 yuan. The bandit who forced the driver was Ding Yuzhai. The driver Zhou Rongye, who insisted that Yang Huai Zhi was the one, actually mistook Ding for Yang, because the two had no difference in appearance or accent. Yang was innocent. But if Yang had not been arrested, the case would not have been solved. It was a strange event. When Guo Wenqi was arrested, 270 yuan of stolen cash was found, which was stored by Ding and was not a perpetrator of the robbery. Xue's stolen money, 340 yuan was deposited in the Zhongnan Bank and 1,200 yuan was deposited in the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, all of which were submitted in writing. Tian's stolen money was sent to his family for 400 yuan. There is also a wanted criminal who remitted 1,800 yuan of stolen money to Ping through the Jin Cheng Bank and took a car to the north. His two pistols were deposited in the Joint Office of the Military at Jincheng Lane and the secretary Zhang Yaonan's place. After the incident, Zhang also fled far away, and the guns have been searched and turned over to the police. The Police Department, with the case clear, will announce the verdict in the coming days. Wang, Xue, Ding, and Tian will all be severely punished in order to issue a clear warning. (February 17)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Preparing to Dredge Rivers and Measure Tributaries</p>
<p>The county government recently convened various sectors and decided to dredge the city moat. A river dredging committee has been organized at Quanjietang and is scheduled to start work on the 20th. Internal staff will be appointed by the director and reported for approval, and preparations will be made separately. The cost of dredging the river is estimated to be 70,000 yuan. Half of the funds will be raised according to the established precedent of collecting donations from annual rent payments, and the remaining funds will be borrowed from road construction funds and other funds. County Magistrate Jin sent Wei Jinsheng to meet with Director Shen of the Construction Department in person to request a payment order. It is now learned that he has been approved. After stating the reasons and submitting them to the department for instructions, the funds can be collected. In terms of engineering, the main river has been surveyed by the director of the county government's technical office, and the depth of dredging according to the original slope has been determined in sections, and a list has been drawn up for bidding for labor. The measurement of each tributary will also begin. Li Zufu, the district chief of the first district, will send personnel to accompany and provide instructions. The tributaries are Bailongtan River, Yangjiaqiao River, from Black Fish Lane to the west, to Bailongtan, then north from Hulong Bridge, to Tong'antangqian, west from Denlong Bridge to the west, along Dujiatan to Taqiao River, south from the Second Higher Primary School to the south, to Yangjiaqiao, then from Yangjiaqiao to Zerunqiao River, Songjiaqiao River, starting from behind Changqiao Street, south to Drunk White Pool, then to Jinshatan, Cangcheng River, starting from the Xiaocangqiao port, to Honglanganqiao. The surveying and mapping staff will lead three surveyors to start measuring each tributary immediately. The committee will divide the city into twelve towns, and each town chief will be responsible for raising funds to facilitate the project.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Jin Shuren Not Allowed to Post Bail</p>
<p>The case of Jin Shuren, former Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government and concurrently Border Defense Commissioner, for dereliction of duty is currently being heard by the Jiangsu Higher Court. Yesterday, Jin's wife, Chen Peilan, telegraphed the Higher Court, stating that Jin was seriously ill in custody and requested permission to post bail for medical treatment outside. President Lin said that the case was serious and it was difficult to approve. At the same time, he telegraphed the warden of the Jiangning District Court Detention Center to supervise the doctor to provide proper medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Three Qian Zhuang Close</h3>
<p>Suzhou's Qian industry has always been strong in the whole county, with annual surpluses, but in recent years it has been very depressed. Yesterday (17th), those who went to the union hall for the团拜(New Year's celebration) included Baoda, Yikang, Qingtai, Jinsheng, Hongyuan, Fuyu, Jiuyuan, Yongsheng, Yongfeng, Shunkang, Yuanchang, Tiansheng, Maosheng, Hongsheng, 恊順, Hongkang, Yuyuan, and other seventeen companies. There were also Yichengyu, Fengtai, and Fuda, three companies, which, due to last year's losses, are currently discussing solutions among shareholders. Whether they can enter the market remains to be decided today (18th). Guanzhen Dingkang, Dongzhong City Hengyu, and Xizhong City Yonglong have decided to close their business and dismiss more than 100 partners and friends. Also, Sha Mingxi, an accountant at Tiansheng, absconded at the end of the year with more than 20,000 yuan, and is currently being pursued. Fengtai's friends have overdrawn about 50,000 yuan, which has made it difficult for the company to continue operating.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Survey Record of Profits and Losses in Various Industries</p>
<p>Wuxi is a prosperous commercial area, but since the floods in Jiangnan and the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the rural economy has been extremely devastated, the market has declined, and the various industries have been greatly affected. Now, after the end of the year, I will record the profits and losses of the various industries as follows: (1) Qian Industry: There are a total of fourteen companies in the city engaged in remittance and lending. Since the silk industry failed the year before last, most of them have been affected. Last year, they all engaged in contraction and were lifeless. The loans made were only one-third of what they were in the past. Only Fuyu, Fuchangsheng, Fuyuan, Yichang, Shenyu, and a few other companies were able to make a small profit. In addition to this, it was only enough to cover expenses. There are still several companies with a larger scope on weekdays, because they have been most affected, and whether they can operate as usual or liquidate their accounts will depend on the final outcome in the future. (2) Rice Industry: Wuxi is a rice-gathering area. There are more than 200 rice shops in the city, combined into eight sections. Recently, affected by the dumping of foreign rice and the consecutive years of good harvests in the country, the rice market has fallen to the extreme. The rice shop business is far from what it used to be. Most of the shops are losing money, with only Beitang Longmao, which specializes in soybeans, making a profit of 10,000 yuan. In addition, Dedayuan, Dinghe, Hefengtai, and Yuanhe in the Sanliqiao section, Yuanda and Changtai in the Huangniqiao section, Zhang Baotai and Changji in the Beizhakou section, and Hengshun in the Ximen section, and Baolong and Zhang Yuchang in Nantang all made a profit of several thousand yuan. The rest are difficult to profit. (3) Silk and Cloth: The industry has been continuously reducing prices since the spring, so the business is very prosperous. At the end of the year, Shihe, Rixin, and Shitaicheng are the best, each with a profit of 10-20,000 yuan. In addition, Jiuyu, Maolun, and Daxin all made a profit of several thousand yuan. (4) South goods: The business of this industry has always been the most lively at the end of the old calendar year. This year, the weather is sunny and the year is fruitful, so the business is also prosperous. Companies such as Wanda, Tianlai, Sanyang, and Yida have profits. (5) Flour: Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast market has been completely seized by Japan. The flour industry has been most affected. In addition, the increase in donations and taxes has increased costs, making it impossible to sell. Inventories are piled up, and the economic impact is even greater. Therefore, they stopped the machines early to avoid being overwhelmed by flour. Regarding the situation of the factories, only Jiufeng had a slight profit. Maoxin's one or two factories usually sell flour in large quantities to the Northeast. Now, sales are sluggish, so it is only enough to cover expenses. Tailong must have lost tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Reconstruction Receives Orders to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Due to the importance of local construction projects, Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Reconstruction, has specially formulated regulations to change the current organizational principles for construction matters in various counties of Jiangsu Province. The regulations stipulate the abolition of all county technicians' offices. Counties with a total annual construction revenue of over 60,000 yuan, or those with particularly important construction projects, may establish a Bureau of Reconstruction. It is stipulated that six counties, including this county, Wuxian, Nantong, Rugao, Jiangdu, and Zhenjiang, establish Bureaus of Reconstruction. The position of Director of the Bureau of Reconstruction in this county has been entrusted by Director Shen to Zhang Fulin, the current Chief of Technical Affairs of the County Government. This appointment has been submitted and approved by the 634th Provincial Government Committee meeting. As for the date of establishment, the Department of Reconstruction originally stipulated early March, but due to the fact that all preparatory procedures may not be completed in time, the establishment must be postponed until mid-March.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>An Overview of the General Year-End Closing for Various Industries</p>
<p>Before January 28th, most industries in Wu County, regardless of the type, generally had surpluses. However, after January 28th, most industries experienced losses rather than profits, and were further affected by the overall collapse of the money-lending industry. Consequently, most industries lost their ability to manage their finances, and business plummeted. Therefore, apart from the bean, lumber, and dyed cloth industries, there is virtually nothing else worth mentioning in terms of profits during this year-end closing. The bean industry's business in 1933 was unprecedented. This was due to an exceptionally good bean harvest in northern Anhui and this province, coupled with the fact that the supply of Dalian beans dwindled after the boycott of enemy goods. As a result, beans from northern Anhui and this province were in great demand for a time, with an average sales volume of over two million piculs. Cuichang was the leading company in this industry, followed by Jintai and Tongchang. The lumber industry has traditionally been a major business in Wu County. Business was still good last year, and the financial situation has improved, so there were profits. The dyed cloth industry benefited from extensive sales in northern Jiangsu, and the financial situation was also good, resulting in considerable profits.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Organizing an Industrial Improvement Association</p>
<p>In order to improve the production sector, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Reconstruction has specifically organized an Industrial Improvement Committee. The committee consists of fifteen members: Leng Yuqiu, Ge Jingzhong, Shao Shenpei, Lu Zirong, Xue Shouxuan, Wu Shenbo, Zhu Jingan, Sun Benzhong, Zheng Bijiang, Xu Tigang, Xu Kangzu, Tang Xixiang, Yi Tingjian, and Xiong Qirui. The Director of the Department of Reconstruction, Shen Baixian, will serve as the chairman of the committee. The first committee meeting is scheduled for the 20th of this month to discuss all procedural matters.</p>
<h3>Fugitives Transferred to the Court</h3>
<p>Cai Deyuan, a native of Wu County, Anhui Province, was previously arrested at the train station for selling counterfeit money and transferred to the court. After the investigation was completed, he was sentenced to two years and six months in prison. After the sentence was confirmed, he was transferred to prison to serve his sentence. However, Cai took advantage of the guards' negligence some time ago, dug a hole, and escaped, also taking Xia Xiaobao, a fellow prisoner, with him. Subsequently, they were captured separately by county government police informants, brought back to the county for interrogation and detention. Zhenjiang Prison, considering that Cai and others had committed the crime of escaping from prison, specifically sent a letter to the court yesterday to handle the case according to the law. The prosecutor's office immediately opened a court to investigate the case and ordered their detention pending investigation and legal action.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Economic Decline and Business Stagnation</p>
<p>Cheng County's businesses, adhering to customs, still carried out their year-end closing on the thirteenth day of the second month. However, due to the impact of the rural economic decline, all industries are stagnating. Only three financial institutions remain: Yongcheng, Xiecheng, and Taiji. During July and August, the orders for cloth mills were very enthusiastic. Huacheng alone had seven to eight million in sales for the entire year, but it was slightly affected during the Fujian Incident. The yarn mills' business was still good in the first half of the year, but inevitably less so in the second half. Due to the low selling price of rice, few rice merchants made profits. Since the launch of automobiles, the number of passengers on inland river boats has dropped sharply. The Cheng Yu and Cheng Wu lines are barely operating, and the Cheng Xi line has virtually stopped. The silk and cloth business is difficult to maintain. Wanyusen Yongsheng in the city and Jinyusen Qiafengxiang outside the north gate have all announced liquidation. Zhicheng Company, a printing business, has suffered heavy losses, and the shareholders' meeting has decided to liquidate, resulting in the indefinite suspension of the publication of newspapers that uphold justice.</p>

<p>Italian Aviator Pineto to Perform Technical Feats This Afternoon</p>
<h3>Postponed Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Hongqiao Airfield is a Military Area</p>
<p>Entry Tickets Printed to Restrict Access</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Colonel Pineto, a renowned Italian aviator, has been in China for two months and has strongly supported China's aviation industry. In addition to visiting the Aviation School in Hangzhou last time, he is also scheduled to perform aviation techniques at the Hongqiao Airfield in western Shanghai at 3:00 PM this afternoon in order to promote the interest of the Chinese people in the aviation industry. However, because Pineto believes that the Hongqiao Airfield has important military significance, in order to prevent other accidents, he has specially printed entry tickets to restrict access. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter visited Pineto at his residence yesterday. According to him, he came to Shanghai on the same ship as Zhang Xueliang. In view of the underdeveloped state of civil aviation in China, he came to promote it. Tomorrow (i.e., today) at 3:00 PM, he will perform at Hongqiao for about 20 minutes to half an hour. Postponed due to rain, but if the weather is like today (referring to the 17th) afternoon, it will still be held as usual, because the performance is not affected by the weather, but if it rains, the field will be muddy, and the audience will be reluctant to come. Pineto also said that students from universities in Europe and the United States are happy to engage in aviation, and their civil aviation is particularly developed. Only China's civil aviation has not seen anyone promote it, which is a sense of backwardness. Pineto also stated that each of the entry tickets he issued can be used by dozens of people, and he welcomes people to bring their families to visit.</p>

Business will fully resume today.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance's Taxation Administration Revises Import Match Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Orders Have Been Issued Separately to Comply</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance revised the import tax rate on matches on November 5 and increased the consolidated tax, imported matches have taken the opportunity to dump their products, which has greatly affected the domestic match industry in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, almost to the point of being unable to maintain itself. The match industry associations of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have specifically organized an association to actively carry out a tax reform movement. Now the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance has submitted the revised method of levying taxes on imported bulk matches and flat-box or booklet-style matches to the Ministry of Finance for circulation and implementation, so as to be fair and equitable. Yesterday, I found two documents from the Taxation Administration and copied them as follows:</p>
<h3>Revised Tax Rate for Bulk Matches</h3>
<p>The Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance orders all regional bureaus to revise the tax calculation standards for imported bulk matches. The original text states that the tax rate for bulk matches listed in Item E of Article 3 of Chapter 2 of the Consolidated Match Tax Collection Regulations previously issued by the Administration, which is 1.25 yuan per 100 catties (i.e., 60.48 kilograms), refers to the bulk matches that are poorly made three-headed and four-headed matches and incomplete matches produced by domestic manufacturers, and stipulates that they are limited to sales in the local area and are not allowed to be transported to other places for sales. Complete bulk matches cannot be handled in the same way. Now it is found that imported matches are sometimes imported in bulk, and they are complete and tidy matches. It is urgent to formulate another tax calculation standard in order to collect taxes and prevent abuses. Now it is found that the weight of the matches in each large box (i.e., 7,200 small boxes) of Grade B and C matches (excluding the leather box) is about 48 catties. For the sake of fairness, the Administration intends to use this weight as the standard. Hereafter, whenever imported bulk matches are imported, regardless of the length of each match, each unit will be uniformly calculated as 48 kilograms, and the national currency of 21 yuan should be levied according to the newly revised safety match Grade C tax rate. If there is an excess or a deficiency, it should still be levied proportionally in order to be fair and equitable. In addition to informing the Customs Administration to inform all customs offices and issuing separate orders, the bureau director and the director of the bureau are also instructed to inform and instruct all their subordinates to be informed. This order,</p>
<h3>Flat Box and Booklet-Style Match Tax</h3>
<p>At the same time, all regional bureaus were ordered to formulate the tax collection methods for imported flat-box and booklet-style matches. The original text states that the Administration's collection of consolidated match taxes has always been handled in accordance with the fixed rules. However, it is found that the box-packed matches of imported safety matches are quite inconsistent. Some are packed in flat boxes, and some are packed in booklet-style. The review is inconsistent with the fixed rules. In order to facilitate tax collection, it is urgent to formulate another collection method to show flexibility and to be uniform. Now it is proposed that for imported flat-box matches, if the volume of each small box is between 48 millimeters and 59 millimeters, and the width and thickness are two degrees, and the number of matches in the box does not exceed the Grade A regulations and is less than 100, each unit (i.e., 7,200 small boxes) should be levied 17.4 yuan of consolidated tax according to the currently stipulated safety match Grade B tax rate. For booklet-style matches, it is now proposed to calculate according to weight. Each 48 kilograms (including the leather), the national currency of 21 yuan should be levied according to the current safety match Grade C tax rate. If there are any odd lots, they should still be levied proportionally in order to be fair and equitable. If imported matches are subsequently encountered, and the width and thickness of the box are less than the Grade A regulations, they should still be taxed according to Grade A. If the volume of the box exceeds the Grade A regulations by one degree, even if it is less than Grade B, it should also be taxed according to Grade B, and so on. As for the number of matches in each box, if it exceeds the scope of each grade's regulations, the tax should be increased by one grade in accordance with the regulations to prevent cheating. In addition to submitting a report to the Ministry for record and informing the Customs Administration to inform all customs offices and issuing separate orders, the bureau director and the director of the bureau are also instructed to inform and instruct all their subordinates to be informed. This order,</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Reduces the Silver Syndicate's Collateral</h3>
<p>Li Ming is Now Negotiating on Behalf of the Ministry</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Ministry of Finance is issuing a new treasury bond of 44 million yuan to Shanghai's banking industry, using the indemnity returned by Italy as collateral. A reporter inquired with the local banking industry yesterday and learned that the funds are still being negotiated and distributed. The original total amount of loans allocated to Shanghai's banking industry was 30 million yuan, but the banks that were allocated the loans believed that the amount was too large to bear, and requested a slight reduction. The total amount of 16 banks is between 20 million and 25 million, and the Ministry of Finance is also considering a slight reduction. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance has asked Li Ming, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, to negotiate with the banks on its behalf.</p>
<h3>The Navy's Chongyi Gunboats Launched Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Shouting Chaired, Students From Tongji Threw Bottles</p>
<p>The Self-Made Jiangfeng Aircraft Flew Around the Ceremony Site</p>
<p>Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan Came to Shanghai From Beijing to Participate</p>
<p>The Navy Department's Ning-class gunboats No. 7 and No. 8, Chongning and Yining, were laid down on November 12 last year, the anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister, and were built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. The launching ceremony was held at 3:30 PM yesterday. Wang Shouting, Commander of the Training Fleet of the Navy, chaired the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Ceremony Site Arrangement</h3>
<p>The site was located east of the No. 3 dock of the Navy's Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao, in front of the Chongning and Yining gunboats. A temporary platform was built with wooden planks, about three zhang long, one zhang wide, and five chi high. In the center hung a portrait of the Prime Minister and the flag of the party and the country. National flags were hung around the platform. Ye Baoqi, the commander of the Navy Guard Battalion, led a team of soldiers to strictly guard the ceremony site. At the same time, all the soldiers of the Hai Rong warship were armed and stationed next to the two gunboats.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees of the launching ceremony included Wang Shouting, Commander of the Navy Training Fleet, Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director of Jiangnan Shipyard, Ye Zaifu, Director of the Shipbuilding Department, Yu Jianfu, Director of the Business Department, Liu Wu, Director of the Inspection and Construction Department, Liang Xunying, Director of the Materials Department, Qiu Zizhong and Chen Yongqin, captains of the ships Yixian, Tongji, Hairong, Yongjian, Yongji, Zhongshan, Haining, and Suning stationed in Shanghai, officers from the Training Fleet Command and the First Fleet Command, and more than 1,000 employees, workers, and guests from the shipyard. Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Jiangfeng Flying Around</h3>
<p>Zeng Yijing, Director of the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Office, specially dispatched the newly renovated Jiangfeng aircraft, which had completed the land-based wheel and plate work, to be piloted by Xu Chengqi, an aviation instructor of the Ning Navy ship, during the launching ceremony of the Chongyi gunboats. The aircraft took off from Shanghai Huazhong Airport at 3:00 PM, flew in the sky above Gaochangmiao, and performed technical feats. After the launching ceremony was completed at 4:00 PM, it returned to the Aircraft Office in Gaochangmiao after landing at Longhua Airport.</p>
<h3>Bottle Throwing Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Chongyi gunboats were hung with party flags on top, national flags in the middle, and national flags all around. A bottle of champagne wrapped in five-color silk was hung on the bow of each boat. At 3:30 PM, Wang Shouting, Commander of the Training Fleet, presided over the ceremony as required. Then Liu Ronglin and Que Yi, students from the Tongji warship, performed the bottle throwing ceremony. First, Liu Ronglin threw the champagne bottle from the bow of the Chongning gunboat towards the bow of the boat. The champagne splashed everywhere, and amid the military music and applause, the boat entered the Huangpu River. At 3:35 PM, Que Yi threw the champagne bottle from the bow of the Yining gunboat in the same way towards the bow of the boat, and the launching was completed.</p>
<h3>Completed in May</h3>
<p>After being launched yesterday, the Chongyi gunboats were moored on the Jiangnan Shipyard's riverside in Gaochangmiao and were still being renovated by the shipyard. They are scheduled to be completed and hoist their flags in May of this year and be incorporated into the Navy's Coastal Defense Office. As for the ninth and tenth gunboats, Changning and Zhining, the keel laying ceremony has been scheduled for the 20th of this month and construction has begun. The boats are 140 feet long, 20 feet wide, displace 350 tons, have a draft of 6 feet, and a speed of 12 knots per hour.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong Reports in Detail on the Inspection of the River Closure Project</h3>
<p>Transportation is Difficult, There is a Risk of Suspension Due to Lack of Materials</p>
<p>The Nature of the River is Changeable, Artificial Materials Must be Available</p>
<p>Inspector Liu Bingzhong is Sent to be Stationed at the Site Permanently</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, attached great importance to the Yellow River closure project and the construction of water defense embankments on both sides of the river. He previously sent Kong Xiangrong, a member of the committee and chief inspector, to the Fenglou construction site to conduct an on-site inspection of the closure situation. It is reported that due to the small rise in the ice jam at the breach, the pile placement in the closure construction was washed away and is now being remedied. The time is approaching the ice flood season, and the influx of ice blocks is particularly noteworthy. In order to prevent accidents, Chairman Kong has forwarded the Chief Inspector's report to the committee's work relief group for review, and has sent Inspector Liu Bingzhong to be stationed at the site permanently to conduct inspections at any time to prevent unforeseen circumstances. The original text of the Chief Inspector's report is disclosed below:</p>
<p>In order to comply with the re-submission of the detailed situation of the project, I pray for your review. I, Xiangrong, was dispatched to Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces to discuss the fundraising methods for the Yellow River breach closure project and to inspect the progress of the closure project at the Fenglou breach. The reports have been submitted separately. I was also instructed to report the details of the project separately. According to the original method of the work relief group, the isolated trees in the water where the willow raft project has been done on the entrance dam are used as the starting point of one end, and the village slope on the opposite bank is used as the starting point of another end. At the same time, willow branches are arranged at both ends, and stones are pressed down to gradually increase the height and progress in turn. Two rows of piles are signed in the water to defend the work. It is heard that it was originally planned to store 8,000 cubic meters of stone materials for demand, and it is estimated that 1,600 cubic meters have been transported. (According to Engineer Qi's report) Except for the use of , there are only about 600 cubic meters left. (According to Engineer Song's report) Iron rails are being paved to prepare for transportation, but because there are not enough trains to allocate and ships are also difficult, the waterway is experiencing freezing, and there are many string ditches on the land road, transportation is inconvenient. Can</p>
<p>Wait for the material to be stopped? That is a question. This should be noted first. It was also found that 34 wooden piles were signed. (According to Engineer Qi's report) The day before Rong arrived at the construction site, eight wooden piles in the deepest part of the big flow were washed away by the ice jam, which was at an important part of the project, causing the two ends of the project to be unable to connect, and there were many obstacles to the progress. Remedial measures are being taken. It is heard that the spring roll method will be used (rolling stone blocks with willow branches or rolling soil bags with hemp bags to sink), but</p>
<p>The water flow is turbulent, and it is also in a deep flow. Can it withstand the flow and implement the closure? That is a question. This should be noted second. Furthermore, the Yellow River has excessive floating sand and the water is fierce. It is not suitable for long piles. It is heard that when Zhou Fuzhi managed the river, he mobilized pile drivers to drive long piles, but the result was a failure. Is it effective to use signing piles now? That is a question. This should be noted third. It is also found that the Yellow River ice flood will arrive in an instant, and the ice blocks will fall and the water level will rise. Both have great harm to the closure project. Can the closure project be completed before the ice flood? That is a question. Even if the closure is completed, can it withstand the damage caused by the water and the water is still running? and still not completed</p>
<p>When the ice flood arrives, is there any considerable preparation to prevent the project from being washed away and failing? That is another big question. This should be noted fourth. It is also found that if this closure project can proceed smoothly, be completed on schedule, and no accidents occur during the ice flood, it should also be noted</p>
<p>When the peach flood and the ambush flood are at high water level, can it be defended? The project here is one of the most important defense lines of the embankment project in the Shitou Zhuang Shuikoumen area. If this place is not defended, then the newly built project will be dangerous everywhere. How should we defend it to achieve perfection? That is another question. This should be noted fifth. In addition, the first diversion canal dug by the project site is too close to the mouth of the canal and has been silted up. The water flow of the second diversion canal is sometimes over and sometimes silted up.</p>
<p>Unimpeded blockage is uncertain. Rong, the inspector, Liu Bingzhong, stayed in Bian to inspect, so Engineer Song made an appointment to go to the breach to observe the current water situation. When he saw that the third diversion canal originally designated by the project site was not in the current direction, Engineer Song made an appointment with the officer to go to the site designated between the second and third diversion canals to sign the central pile of the diversion canal and hand it over to Engineer Li for measurement and construction as the third diversion canal. On the night of January 18, the head of the diversion canal was washed away by the river flow and flowed into the old course, reducing the amount of water at the third breach. The original third diversion canal, which is currently in the current direction, has now been changed to the fourth diversion canal.</p>
<p>Is being excavated for flood discharge. However, in order to maintain the current diversion canal flow and increase the depth, without causing multiple collapses on both slopes, it seems that the willow dam on the opposite bank of the second and third diversion canals should be prevented from advancing too much, causing the diversion canal slope to collapse and the river flow to be scattered and blocked. This should be noted sixth. In short, the closure project is related to the water situation, artificial materials, and the three are simultaneously related. It has been presented yesterday. Because the Yellow River's water is changeable, if the water situation is suitable and artificial materials are available, it will be effective to rush to build day and night. Therefore, the person in charge of the matter pays attention to this three times. All the details of the inspection of the closure project in compliance with the instructions should be submitted for review.</p>
<h3>The Telephone Bureau Took Over the Pudong Telephone Yesterday Evening</h3>
<p>Converted to Common Battery System and Switched From Branch Bureaus</p>
<p>Telephone Charges are Lower Than Before, Number of Users Increases</p>
<p>According to the temporary contract, the Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Telephone Bureau took over the Pudong cross-border telephone from the Shanghai Telephone Company at 8:00 PM yesterday evening. The telephones are all equipped with a common battery system. Director Xu Xueyu and others went to the Pudong Branch Bureau last night to inspect. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Installed Common Battery System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's Pudong cross-border telephone has a total of 78 sets. Since the establishment of the Pudong Branch Bureau of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, it has begun to convert the cross-border telephone to a common battery system. The branch bureau has sent craftsmen to convert the new users' telephones to a common battery system. More than 50 sets have been installed so far, totaling about 130 sets with the cross-border telephone. It is temporarily stipulated that numbers 1 to 70 are new telephone numbers, and numbers 70 to 150 are the converted numbers for cross-border telephones.</p>
<h3>Took Over Last Night</h3>
<p>At 8:00 PM yesterday evening, the Telephone Bureau took over the Pudong cross-border telephone, cut off the telephone line that directly connected the former concession to Pudong, and transferred it to the Pudong Branch Bureau for switching. When users in the concession want to talk to users in Pudong, they should first dial (04), which is the (04) manual station in the central Jiangxi Road of the telephone company, and then the operator will connect to the Pudong Branch Bureau and transfer to the Pudong user's number. When users of the Nanshi Zhabei automatic machine want to talk to users in Pudong, they should first dial (36), the number of the Pudong Branch Bureau, and transfer to the Pudong user. Jiangwan, Zhenru, Wusong, Longhua, etc., are all transferred according to the manual telephone usage method.</p>
<h3>Director's Inspection</h3>
<p>Xu Xueyu, Director of the Telephone Bureau, Yu Bingjian, Engineer, and others went to the Pudong Branch Bureau at 7:00 PM yesterday afternoon to inspect. After the official takeover, the staff of the Pudong Branch Bureau were very busy. The bureau has also reported the takeover process to the Ministry of Communications. As for the Pudong cross-river line, it was originally 150 pairs from the Telephone Company's Sanmalu Bund. Now it has been purchased by the Telephone Bureau, and 50 pairs have been added in Gaochangmiao, totaling 200 pairs. Pudong users can install a total of 600 households.</p>
<h3>Low Telephone Charges</h3>
<p>After the Pudong cross-border telephone was taken over by the Telephone Bureau last night, the telephone charges payable by users in February will still be collected by the Telephone Company before February 17, and the Telephone Bureau will collect them from February 18. When the Telephone Company charged before, due to the cross-river line relationship, the quarterly charge for users' residences, businesses, and factories was from 60 to 90 taels. Now the Telephone Bureau's charges stipulate that the monthly charge for Pudong users' residences is 12 yuan, and the monthly charge for businesses and factories is 15 yuan, which is much lower than before. Therefore, it is expected that the number of Pudong users will inevitably increase.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Liu Weichi and Others Came Together</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of Industry Liu Weichi, Minister of Personnel Niu Yongjian, Deputy Minister of the Interior Peng Xuepei, Legislative Yuan Member Ma Yinchu, etc., arrived in Shanghai on the night express train the night before last at 11:00 PM.

<h3>Central Government Orders Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to Send Personnel to Supervise the Inspection of Ancient Artifacts from the Palace Museum</h3>
<p>Over 13,000 Boxes Stored in Shanghai</p>
<p>Inspection and Inventory to Begin Soon</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the central government, in order to carefully protect ancient artifacts, specially resolved at the 107th Standing Committee meeting that when the newly appointed Director Ma of the Palace Museum inspects and receives the ancient artifacts, one person each should be sent from the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters to supervise the portion in Beijing, and two people should be sent from the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters to supervise the portion in Shanghai.

According to Ouyang Banghua, the section chief of that office, there are currently over 13,000 boxes of ancient artifacts stored in Shanghai. Director Ma is currently inspecting and taking inventory of the portion in Beijing, and will come to Shanghai to begin inspection and receipt as soon as it is finished.</p>
<h3>Two-Railways Administration Organizes Railway-Owned Properties</h3>
<p>Reconstructing Destroyed Property Maps from the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>Renewing Lease Agreements and Clearing Arrears</p>
<p>The railway-owned properties of the Two-Railways (Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways) are scattered and fragmented. In addition, during the January 28th Incident, nineteen volumes of records and maps related to the properties were destroyed, making it difficult to investigate and verify. Therefore, it was decided to start with a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of the matter and take the opportunity to improve the situation. In addition to checking deeds and re-compiling lease agreements, work such as surveying and mapping land is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Creating Land Maps</h3>
<p>For the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway properties, the maps and records were retrieved from the Hangzhou Engineering Office to first reconstruct the maps of the railway properties. Then, according to the old lease agreements, maps of lease affairs and general maps of branch stations were created. For the properties of the Shanghai-Nanjing Main Line and the Songhu Branch Line, most of the original maps and records were destroyed, so they can only be re-surveyed for mapping. The original survey team personnel will be assigned to this task, and some engineering interns will be recruited to assist. Starting from the Songhu Branch Line’s Paotaiwan, the leased land area will be measured, and the maps of lease affairs will be reconstructed. At the same time, the names of tenants will be investigated, the boundaries of railway properties will be marked, and lists will be compiled for future reference. The Songhu Line has already been surveyed and is being annotated with standard scale sizes and re-calculating the area. Half of the Shanghai-Nanjing Line has also been surveyed. In total, more than 160 maps of lease affairs and more than ten station boundary lease affairs maps have been created for the main and branch lines. In another half year, all work can be completed. When the land maps and records are drawn in the future, maps of the respective cities and counties will be created and sent to the respective cities and counties for record-keeping to confirm property rights.</p>
<h3>Renewing Lease Agreements</h3>
<p>Due to years of unrest and the January 28th Incident, many lease agreements for leased railway land have been left un-renewed, and some have expired long ago without being renewed. First, expired lease agreements were checked, and the lease agreements that expired at the end of the 20th year of the Republic were urgently checked and sent for renewal. At the same time, the renewal of lease agreements that expired at the end of the 21st year of the Republic was carried out. In total, 1,216 of these lease agreements were sent for renewal in one year, and the work is still continuing.</p>
<h3>Clearing Rent Arrears</h3>
<p>Some tenants of the Two-Railways properties have been in arrears with their rent for as long as ten years. By the end of the 21st year of the Republic, the total amount of rent arrears reached a huge sum of seventy to eighty thousand yuan, and the number of tenants was also very large. In order to thoroughly clear the arrears, the lists were checked and listed by station, by tenant, by year, and by amount. The methods for collection were devised in order of importance. For example, the China Transportation Company owed more than thirty-five thousand yuan. After negotiations, the freight depot built by the company at the Shangbei Station was valued and transferred to the Administration. The insufficient amount was deducted from the deposited security deposit. Another example is the Hangzhou Waterworks renting land to build a factory, and the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway renting land to lay sidings. Lease agreements were negotiated and signed to collect rent and settle outstanding cases. As for the leased land in the Gaozi Longtan area, where there were no agreements or maps, making it difficult to collect rent, personnel were sent to identify the leased land area, tenant names, and sign agreements with attached maps, and re-determine rents to collect rent according to the agreement to clarify the situation. The arable land rented out at the entire Gongchen Bridge station had inconsistent elevations and rent disputes, which had been pending for a long time. An average rent method was properly drafted, and leases were renewed and rented out separately, completing everything.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee Drafts Improvement Plan for the Songhu-Hankou Section</h3>
<p>Has Not Been Implemented Due to Funding Issues</p>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Sends Letter to the Council for Discussion</p>
<p>The waterway between Wusong and Hankou on the Yangtze River is gradually silting up. The Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee under the Ministry of Transportation has specially submitted a request to the Ministry to forward it to the National Economic Council for discussion. After receiving the request, the Ministry of Transportation sent a letter to the Economic Council, stating: "According to the report submitted by the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee, the plan for improving the Yangtze River waterway between Wusong and Hankou, drafted by this committee, has been approved for several years, but it has not yet been implemented due to funding issues.

<h3>Antai Company's Changtai Ship Encounters Danger and Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Antai Shipping Company's Changtai ship has always sailed between Xinghua and Quanzhou in Fujian, transporting flour and other items to Fujian, and bringing longan to Shanghai. This time, it set sail from Shanghai and exited the port on the morning of the 5th of this month.

<h3>New Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Xiangxian Talks</h3>
<p>Further Preparations Needed Before Taking Office in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Development of Hangzhou Depends on its Economic Strength</p>
<p>Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou has been transferred to the Design Committee of the Military Commission. The Zhejiang Provincial Government meeting resolved that Zhou Xiangxian will succeed him. Zhou has come to Shanghai from Beijing. He told reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that he needs to make further preparations before taking office as the mayor of Hangzhou again, and the date has not yet been determined. As for the current staff of the Hangzhou Municipal Government, no changes are planned, except for those who are incompetent and unable to fulfill their duties. As for whether there are any new plans for the Hangzhou municipal administration, it depends on the economic strength of Hangzhou. It is not difficult to formulate plans, but it is necessary to have the economic strength to complete them and achieve results. It is reported that Zhou has resigned from his current concurrent positions as Chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee and will leave Shanghai for Hangzhou to take office within two or three weeks. Zhou graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, majoring in municipal administration and water conservancy. After returning to China, he assisted Zhu Qiqian in handling the Beijing municipal administration. Later, he worked for the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee. He served as the mayor of Hangzhou in the 17th year of the Republic of China, planned carefully, and achieved remarkable results. He resigned in the 19th year of the Republic of China and served as a counselor to the Ministry of Finance and the Chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee, as well as the Director of the Lushan Administration. In the summer of last year, when the Yangtze River water level suddenly rose, the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu jointly formed a flood control committee, with Zhou serving as chairman. This time, he is serving as the mayor of Hangzhou, returning to his old place.</p>
<h3>Overseas Compatriots' Association of Western Fujian Telegraphed the Central Government Yesterday Requesting a Campaign Against the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>The Overseas Compatriots' Association of Western Fujian in various countries is concerned about the years of banditry and disaster, the devastation of the local area, and the unbearable suffering of the people. Yesterday, they specially issued a telegram as follows: To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan and the Military Commission of the Nanjing National Government, Western Fujian has suffered from years of military disasters and banditry, the devastation of the local area, the establishment of villages as strongholds, and heavy taxes, which makes people's lives precarious. Furthermore, the Communist bandits occupied Tinglong and invaded Hangyong the year before last, causing endless misery, displacement, and deep suffering for many years. Although the recent situation has initially stabilized, the banditry in Western Fujian is prone to flare up, and the plight of the people has not been resolved, leading to further suffering. How can our people endure this? As the situation in Fujian gradually stabilizes, we deeply hope that the central government will issue an order to suppress the bandits. We beseech you to order a campaign to quell the banditry as soon as possible and save the people of Fujian from their misery. Our fellow Western Fujian compatriots at home and abroad pledge to be the central government's backing. This telegram is urgent. The Overseas Compatriots' Association of Western Fujian bows in respect.</p>
<h3>Two-Railways Personnel Advocate Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Hoping for Everyone to Join</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Administration issued a notice to various departments yesterday, stating: "According to the report submitted by the Two-Railways Promoting Domestic Goods Movement Committee, it is the national duty of citizens to purchase domestic goods. However, as a result of years of promotion, foreign goods have become more prevalent, and domestic goods have declined. This is truly heartbreaking. The most formidable enemy that devastates domestic goods is foreign goods, especially Japanese goods, which account for the largest proportion of foreign goods. Everyone knows this. Therefore, the most effective way to resist economic aggression by imperialists is to resist foreign goods and promote domestic goods, which go hand in hand. However, resisting foreign goods is only a passive and temporary solution, while promoting domestic goods is an active and fundamental solution. The committee believes that in today's China, which is deeply troubled, only the promotion of domestic goods is the most practical and effective national salvation movement. All employees of the Two-Railways are national civil servants and have an inescapable responsibility to promote domestic goods. They should set an example and implement the promotion. It has been resolved at the second committee meeting of this committee to submit a report to the Party Headquarters, Railway Bureau, and Trade Union, ordering their subordinate organizations to join this committee as members. In addition to submitting it separately, we hereby submit a document to your bureau, ordering your subordinate organizations to join this committee as members, to promote domestic goods and maintain them permanently, which is beneficial to the public." In accordance with this, it should be approved and complied with. It is hereby notified to the said department for your information and to order your subordinate organizations to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Customs Lianxing Warship Completed</h3>

<h3>New Fujian Civil Affairs Director Li Zuyu Discusses Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Focus on Rectifying Officialdom and Unifying Powers</p>
<p>Scheduled to Take the Changsha Maru to Fujian Tomorrow</p>
<p>The newly appointed member of the Fujian Provincial Government and Director of Civil Affairs, Li Zuyu, was originally a lawyer in Shanghai. Since accepting the appointment, he has been busy ending his legal affairs. Because of the repeated urgings of Fujian Chairman Chen Yi, he is scheduled to take the Changsha Maru to Fujian tomorrow (19th) to take office. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency paid a special visit yesterday, and the conversation on various issues is as follows:</p>
<h3>Rectifying Officialdom</h3>
<p>Li said first that he holds a kind of determination and sacrifice to serve as the Director of Civil Affairs in Fujian Province, that is, to seek benefits for the country and the people, not to seek personal fame and wealth. He believes that there are many aspects of civil affairs that should be improved, but it is necessary to start with the rectification of officialdom.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing Assessment</h3>
<p>Regarding the rectification of officialdom, Li takes three points: First, after taking office, he will prioritize the assessment and appointment of talents in the province (referring to Fujian Province) who do not violate the personnel standards expressed by Chairman Chen (Yi), and hope that the number of people from this province who are employed can exceed those from outside the province.</p>
<h3>Unifying Powers</h3>
<p>Second, it is heard that the power of personnel administration in Fujian Province cannot be unified. If it is not rectified, it will be a major obstacle to officialdom. After taking office, he plans to first rectify it. The length of his tenure in Fujian depends on whether the proposed rectification and unification work can proceed.</p>
<h3>Personnel Standards</h3>
<p>Third, Fujian Province is a poor province, so he hopes that all officials in Fujian, large and small, can be frugal, hardworking, responsible, and have a spirit of sacrifice, so that they can alleviate the suffering of the people of Fujian. This is the standard of personnel he limits, so all those who are accustomed to extravagance, or whose words and deeds do not match, are on the list of those who will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Investment</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reporter asked what his opinion was on the fact that the Fujian Overseas Chinese Association in Shanghai, the Overseas Chinese Federation, and the Overseas Fujian Save Hometown Association and other organizations had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Military Commission to plan the ten coastal counties of southern Fujian for overseas Chinese to transfer funds back to the country for construction and to try out local self-government. Li said that he did not know the details of this point, but it depended on how Chairman Chen (Yi) of Fujian Province decided. The Fujian Provincial Government will welcome overseas Chinese to transfer back to the country for construction.</p>

<h3>Scheduled Departure</h3>
<p>Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen, in order to promote domestic goods and strengthen the national foundation, allocated 100,000 yuan to organize the Hankou City Mobile Domestic Goods Exhibition and invited domestic goods manufacturers from all over the country to participate. After receiving the letter, the Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting Domestic Goods sent personnel to Hankou to assist in the preparations and notified the factories to participate enthusiastically. As of yesterday, more than 120 factories have registered. As the opening date is approaching, the factories will ship the goods to Hankou to the Sanbei Wharf on the afternoon of tomorrow, and the New Sanbei ship of Sanbei Steamboat Company, which is contracted for exclusive use of the committee, is scheduled to set sail for Hankou on the 20th. The staff members of the factories are scheduled to depart on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Representatives</h3>
<p>Wang Heqing, the Standing Committee Member of the Hankou Special City Party Headquarters and Secretary-General of the Exhibition, came to Shanghai by ship a few days ago to investigate the products of domestic goods factories in Shanghai. In order to report the quantity of products and the situation of each factory, and to strengthen ties, the Citizens' Association for Promoting Domestic Goods scheduled a public banquet at the Fuxing Garden on Wuma Road at 6 pm tomorrow, and notified the factories to send representatives to participate.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Samples</h3>
<p>The association issued a notice to the factories yesterday to solicit samples for display in Hankou.

We have invited this association to lead the Shanghai domestic goods display for the purpose of observation and guidance. In addition to actively preparing, if our domestic goods factories are interested in expanding sales in the central China region and participating in the display, please select exquisite products, equip them with packaging and brochures, pack them firmly, mark the factory name, and send them to this association at 51 Gaoguan Street, Jiumudi before the 18th of this month.

This notice."</p>
<h3>Guo Chengen and Others Establish a Gas Production Company</h3>
<p>Someone Attempts to Sabotage</p>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, there were only two companies in Shanghai that manufactured and sold industrial oxygen and carbon dioxide: the French-owned Oriental Company and the British-owned Oxygen Company. Therefore, they had a monopoly and engaged in speculation and hoarding, and Chinese factories have suffered from this for more than a day. The amount of money leaked out every year is also quite alarming. Guo Chengen, the former director of the Central Mint, and others, aware of this suffering, took promoting domestic goods as a prerequisite and gathered like-minded people to purchase land and build houses at 537 Liaoyang Road, establishing the China Industrial Gas Production Co., Ltd. They hired Li Yunxian as the manager and planned for several years before starting to produce oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other types of gas in December last year. The oxygen composition has been certified by chemical inspection agencies to reach 99.8 degrees, which can save more than 50% of consumption compared to ordinary 94-96 degree goods. The carbon dioxide composition is also very pure. Now, Chinese factories in Shanghai, such as the Yabuer Electric Factory, are purchasing them one after another. Even foreign-owned businesses, such as the Electric Power Company, the Waterworks Company, and the Old Shipyard, who used to purchase from British and French companies, have also changed to ordering from this company. As the company's purpose is to promote domestic goods, not to make profits, the prices are lower than those of the British and French companies. Recently, in order to maintain their business, the two companies have had to lower prices from time to time. Recently, they have used their economic aggression tactics, deliberately depressing prices in an attempt to squeeze them out. The company has maintained its composure, refused to yield, and fought to the end, and the foreign merchants could do nothing. Unexpectedly, the police recently arrested a suspicious person near the company. According to the person, he was sent by someone to take secret actions in front of the company's factory, hoping to harm it secretly. Manager Li thought that since the case had been discovered first and there had been no tangible losses, he was magnanimous and did not pursue it further. Unexpectedly, on the night of the following day, someone threw a bomb at the company, intending to destroy it. Fortunately, it did not explode, and there was no loss. The company has now reported the matter to the police and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Concession Telephone Trunk Lines Being Replaced with Armored Cables</h3>
<p>For Safety, Work Started Yesterday</p>
<p>Total of 200 Pairs to be Completed in Two Weeks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, in view of the fact that the lines connecting Nanshi to the Concession used to be overhead cables, has decided, for safety's sake, to replace the overhead cables on the telephone poles along Min Guo Road from Xiaodongmen to the Jixiang Street intersection with armored cables buried underground. A total of 200 pairs will be installed, divided into two lines, each with 100 pairs. It is understood that these are the trunk lines from Nanshi to the Concession and from the Concession to Nanshi. Yesterday, the bureau sent engineers and workers to start digging, and the armored cables are scheduled to be laid on Monday. It is estimated that the work will be completed in two weeks.</p>

<h3>Gunshots Break the Early Morning Silence - A Wounded Robber Apprehended</h3>
<p>Three Robbers Suddenly Invade Yuan Futang’s Home Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Two Detectives Pursue After Receiving Report, Gunfire Heard All the Way</p>
<p>丨Rickshaw Puller Bravely Captures Robber, Wounded by Robber's Gun丨</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a robbery and resisting arrest incident involving gunfire occurred on Rue Bayle and Avenue Dubail in the French Concession. As a result, one robber was shot and captured, and a rickshaw puller was severely wounded by the robber. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Arrive Suddenly in the Early Morning</h3>
<p>Yuan Futang, a native of Shandong, is 62 years old and has been running the Hengxiang Tong Customs Brokerage at No. 4, Lane 135, Jiangxi Road, Public Concession, as the manager for many years. His business is quite prosperous. He lives at No. 44, Xingye Li, Avenue Dubail, French Concession. Yesterday morning, being the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, Yuan had already gone to his office. Only his nephew Yuan Shenchu (38 years old) and a female servant were guarding the door at home, while Yuan's wife and two children were still asleep in bed. Suddenly, three robbers arrived.</p>
<h3>Entering the Bedroom to Rob</h3>
<p>At 8:45 AM, the three robbers broke in through the front door. One robber remained at the front door to keep watch, while the other two, one wearing a scarlet Western suit and the other an overcoat, speaking with Xiang-E (Hunan-Hubei) accents and carrying guns, barged straight into Yuan's wife's bedroom on the second floor. Yuan's wife was terrified. The robbers slapped the female servant several times on the face, forcing her to reveal where the money was hidden. As a result, they robbed 46 silver dollars in cash, one gold ring, and one gold ear pick. While the two robbers were searching, a neighbor surnamed Yu noticed what was happening and immediately secretly reported it to the Lane Inspector, who then reported it to Chinese Constable No. 471.</p>
<h3>Two Detectives Give Chase with Whistles</h3>
<p>After the two robbers had finished looting, they rushed out of the door and fled eastwards along Rue Lafayette. The two detectives followed closely behind, blowing their whistles as they pursued. Knowing that things were not going well, the two robbers fled along Rue Muling, turned south into Rue Pére Robert, and ran frantically, hoping to escape.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Injured While Capturing Robber</h3>
<p>At that time, a rickshaw puller named Zhu Afu was resting at the corner of Rue Bayle. Seeing the robbers running towards him, Zhu bravely stepped forward, intending to capture them head-on. Seeing this, the robber in the Western suit fired at Zhu, who fell to the ground. The robbers continued to flee until they reached the entrance of Hengchang Li. By this time, the two detectives had caught up, and the two sides exchanged fire. Gunshots rang out like a string of pearls.</p>
<h3>One Robber Wounded and Captured</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, a resident of No. 18, Hengchang Li, was Chen Jinfan, Detective Sergeant No. 121 of the French Police. At the time, Detective Chen had just gotten up to eat when he suddenly heard gunshots. At first, he suspected it was children playing with firecrackers for the New Year, but when he heard police whistles, he knew something was wrong. He quickly grabbed his gun and rushed out, only to see one robber lying in a pool of blood, having been shot. He arrested the robber, who had been shot in the abdomen and left heel. At the same time, Chief Inspector Jin Jiulin had heard the news and arrived. He first sent the wounded robber to Guangci Hospital and questioned him briefly. The robber claimed his surname was Wang, but his answers were vague. The chief inspector immediately reported to the police chief to apprehend the remaining accomplices for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Qiu Tianbao's Storekeeper Surrenders, Reporting Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Embezzled Total of 120 Taels of Gold Worth 14,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Fearing Trouble for Guarantor, He Surrenders to Zhabei Police Station with Lawyer</p>
<p>Xu Kaitai, a native of Ningbo, living at No. 82, Hengji Li, Gordon Road, was a storekeeper at the Qiu Tianbao Silver Store at No. 500, Nanjing Road. Yesterday afternoon at 6:30 PM, Xu, accompanied by a lawyer, surrendered to the Zhabei Police Station, stating that due to speculation, he had embezzled 120 taels of gold from the store, worth 14,000 yuan. Fearing that his guarantor would be implicated, he surrendered. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanqing and Detective Wan Wangke, it was learned that Xu had been a storekeeper at Qiu Tianbao since 1926. Because of his good character, he had gained the trust of the manager. Later, his younger brother, Kai Fu, had embezzled more than 1,000 yuan from the Qinghua Silver Store. Due to sibling ties, Xu helped to make up for it. He secretly took goods from the store to repay the debt. He then planned to speculate in mark (biao jin), but repeatedly failed, resulting in such a large debt. Recently, due to the change in the system of weights and measures, the store wanted to check the inventory. Fearing exposure, Xu reported to Assistant Manager Yao Guiqing. However, Yao did not report it to the police but only negotiated compensation with Xu's guarantor. Fearing trouble for his guarantor, Xu went to the police station to report it. Xu was immediately detained and sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division One, yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan charged him with embezzlement in the course of business under Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. However, since it was a voluntary surrender, he requested that the penalty be determined in accordance with the regulations on voluntary surrender. Xu Kaitai confessed to the above situation without denial, requesting leniency, and claimed that he would find ways to repay the embezzled funds within his ability. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession, ordered the conclusion of the arguments, and scheduled the verdict for Saturday morning next week. Xu Kaitai was allowed to be released on bail of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Transportation Sends Shen Jiyun to Wuhan to Adjudicate the Wanxiang Disaster</h3>
<p>One Trial Has Already Been Held in Wuhan</p>
<p>Responsibility Issues Becoming Clearer</p>
<p>The case of the Sanbei Company's Wanxiang steamer colliding with and sinking the Yunbing Chai wheelship Luan, which was carrying soldiers, on the Qichun Diaoyu River on December 10 of last year, resulting in the drowning of more than 300 recruits, was reported in this newspaper earlier. The Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau has now organized a Ship Collision Committee, hired navigation experts, and is holding an adjudication. The latest news is as follows.</p>
<h3>Headquarters Conducts Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>After the Wanxiang collided with and sank the Luan wheelship, Wang Jingkui, the head of the Wuhan Fourth Recruitment Office, sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stating that the Luan was carrying more than 200 recruits to Jiangxi. On the evening of November 11, while sailing on the Qichun Diaoyu River, it was struck by the Sanbei's Wanxiang steamer, which was sailing upstream against the waves. At that time, it was dusk, and both sides sounded their horns as a warning. When they got close, the Wanxiang wrongly shifted course, causing the Luan to be unable to avoid it in time, resulting in a collision and sinking. The Wanxiang stopped its engines to rescue, but other than rescuing more than 40 people, more than 300 people were buried in the belly of the fish. In addition to investigating and reporting the names, martial arts, and clothing of the drowned recruits, he was first telegraphing a report. After receiving the report, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately sent Wang Wu, an inspector from the headquarters, to the scene of the accident and to ports such as Hankou to conduct an on-site investigation. Wang Wu's report was largely the same as that reported by Wang Jingkui. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, considering that this case involved the drowning of more than 200 lives, and that the responsibility lay with which party, ordered the Jiangxi-Anhui-Henan Bandit Suppression Headquarters to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Three Trials</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of responsibility in this case, the pilots of the Sanbei Wanxiang steamer and the Luan wheelship blamed each other, each with their own reasons, and both claimed to have sounded their whistles before the collision. The two sides could not reach a decision, so the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, together with the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau, notified Sanbei and Luan steamer owners to hire impartial personnel from the shipping industry to go to Wuhan to form a Collision Arbitration Committee. The Sanbei side appointed Wang Youshi, captain of the Jianguo ship of the local China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as its arbitration representative. After Wang Youshi arrived in Wuhan, the first step was to conduct several on-site investigations in Qichun with all relevant personnel, collecting witness statements and special evidence for the case. He then summoned the ship owners and pilots of the Wanxiang and Luan steamers to the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau to review the sailing history of both sides and to investigate the circumstances of the collision of the two ships. From the beginning of January this year to the present, the crew members of the two ships have been summoned for three trials. Both sides had their own arguments, and there were initial clues as to responsibility. However, for the sake of careful arbitration, another trial is needed before a judgment can be made.</p>
<h3>Ministry Sends Special Commissioner</h3>
<p>This case is a rare tragedy among domestic merchant ship disasters on the Yangtze River in recent years, and the victims were armed comrades who lost more than 300 lives. It was feared that relying solely on the arbitrators of the two sides would not be credible. Therefore, after the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau reported to the Ministry of Transportation, Minister Zhu Jiahua decided to send an additional arbitrator from the Ministry to Wuhan to participate in the trial, but this person must be highly respected in the navigation industry and have excellent academic knowledge in order to be competent for this important task. After considering the matter, Minister Zhu decided to send Shen Jiyun, the current Chief Shipmaster of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to serve as the special commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Transportation to participate in the arbitration. After the decision was made, the commission was issued to Shanghai, and Mr. Shen immediately went to Wuhan to join the arbitration court as the chief arbitrator to try this unprecedented shipwreck disaster.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers of Xu Leqing Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Lao Jiu Asks Wife to Remarry</p>
<p>Yao Zhifa Has Nothing More to Say</p>
<p>The kidnappers Wang Lao Jiu and Yao Zhifa, both 24 years old and from Shaoxing, were sentenced to death by the First Special District Court after being arrested by detectives from the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station for conspiring to kidnap Xu Leqing, a prominent businessman and broker at the Cloth Exchange, on the morning of September 1 last year, and for shooting Xu to death with a handgun when the kidnapping failed. The sentence was submitted to the higher authorities for approval and ordered to be carried out. Yesterday morning, the police sent the two criminals to the Third Criminal Court, where Judge Shen Shanzeng presided. The attorneys from the Bureau of Public Works, Wang Yaotang, presented the case files and photos to the court, asking the two criminals if they had any last words and sending letters to their families. Wang Lao Jiu said that his wife, Sun Gui'e, was in their hometown and it would be okay for her to remarry, and to come to Shanghai to collect his body. He also asked that Yao Zhifa, who was his good friend, also have his coffin brought back to their hometown for burial. He asked for a drink of wine before the execution. The contact address was Wang Jinlan, uncle at the Baoji Tang Herbal Medicine Shop, Dawang Temple, Sheng County, Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Yao Zhifa said that he had already written letters to his family and had nothing more to say. Both criminals were calm and showed no fear. Judge Shen ordered Wang Lao Jiu and Yao Zhifa to be sent to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for execution by firing squad. The Chinese and foreign constables escorted them down, together with the case files and photos, and boarded a car to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground. The prosecutor sent by the local court arrived at the scene to verify the identities of the two criminals and ordered the bailiffs to tie them up according to the law and carry out the execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Tea House Card Game Leads to Grudge and Knife Attack</h3>
<p>Wang A'siu Bets But Doesn't Get Matched</p>
<p>Next Day He is Slashed by a Crowd</p>
<p>Wang A'siu, 30 years old, a native of Suzhou, is a fruit peddler living at No. 2, Delian Li, Baliliqiao Street, French Concession. As it was the beginning of the Lunar New Year, he was bored at home and went to the Dexing Tea House in Baxianqiao every day to drink tea and pass the time. The afternoon before yesterday, A'siu went to the tea house and saw that a large game of pai gow (Chinese dominoes) was being played in the middle of the tea room, with loud shouts and excitement. A'siu was tempted and also went to place a bet. At that time, the banker was losing badly, so those who bet money were all very happy. However, when A'siu bet six jiao (cents), he was not matched due to the confusion. He negotiated with the banker, but the banker refused to admit it. The two sides argued, almost resorting to violence. Fortunately, others persuaded them to stop. Yesterday afternoon at 3:50 PM, A'siu went to the tea house again. Before he could sit down, eight or nine men rushed up from downstairs, holding sharp knives. When they saw A'siu, they started arguing about the previous night's incident. Before they could say a few words, they slashed A'siu with their knives. A'siu was unable to dodge and had the tip of his left index finger cut off. His left leg, left knee, and back were also each slashed once, and he fell to the ground with severe injuries, bleeding profusely. The tea drinkers nearby were terrified and fled downstairs. Fortunately, nearby Annamite (Vietnamese) constables learned of the incident, went upstairs, arrested three of the assailants, and took them to the police station for interrogation. Wang A'siu was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Fang Junqian Accuses Sun Hengfu of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Initial Trial Dismissed</p>
<p>Second Appeal Rejected</p>
<p>Sun Hengfu, the president of the Siming Bank, was accused by Fang Junqian, a shareholder of the bank, of engaging in embezzlement and harming the interests of the shareholders. Last winter, Fang, through a lawyer, filed a criminal self-suit against Sun with the First Special District Court, stating that the defendant had fabricated and altered account books, with malicious intentions and extremely dangerous methods. Among the most obvious, there were many discrepancies between the annual business report and the diary table for the 20th year. The plaintiff had obtained solid evidence of the defendant's wrongdoing and could prove it item by item. The defendant's actions were unforgivable by both law and morality, so he filed the self-suit, requesting that the case be investigated and punished according to the law. After receiving the complaint, the court held that a shareholder's accusation against a manager, according to the Limited Company Regulations, must be jointly signed by one-tenth of all shareholders to be legal, and that the plaintiff was only suing individually, which seemed inappropriate. Therefore, only the plaintiff was summoned to court to ask about the reasons for the lawsuit. Although the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff's accusation against Sun Hengfu was a personal act and did not involve the entire company, and therefore did not need to consider the company's regulations, the judge ultimately determined that the plaintiff had no right to sue and ruled that the case would not be accepted. However, after receiving the court's ruling, Fang Junqian was very dissatisfied and entrusted the original lawyer to submit a petition to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, appealing the initial trial decision, and stating the reasons why the plaintiff had the right to file a criminal self-suit against Sun Hengfu, requesting that the original ruling be overturned and an appropriate ruling be made to correct the situation. It is now known that after receiving the petition, the Second Branch of the High Court requested the case files from the Special Court. After deliberation by Court President Yu Chan and the court's judges, it was decided to uphold the original ruling and dismiss the appeal. However, after hearing the news, the plaintiff still expressed dissatisfaction.</p>
<h3>Extension of Pharmacist Licenses for Two Years</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a public notice yesterday, stating that it had received instructions from the Provincial Government stating that the Ministry of Interior Affairs had consulted, checked, and issued pharmacist licenses in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Provisional Pharmacist Regulations, with a time limit of five years. The said regulations were promulgated on January 15, 1929. The time limit expired on January 14, 1934, and the number of registered pharmacists and pharmacists was still small, insufficient to meet the needs of society. The Executive Yuan approved the issuance of pharmacist licenses, extending the time limit for years to provide relief. It is hereby ordered that the County Magistrate comply with the order and notify all pharmacists in the county. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>Thirty-Year Typing Expert Testifies That Check Font in Major Fraud Case</h3>
<p>All from Typewriters Belonging to Englishman Mackintosh</p>
<p>Each Typewriter Letter has Special Characteristics, None are the Same</p>
<p>In the case of the embezzlement of large sums from the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, in addition to the two Russians and three Chinese who have been convicted by the First Special District Court, the Englishman Mackintosh, the Portuguese Baptista, and a Frenchman are still on trial. Englishman Mackintosh recently appeared before the British Consular Police Court, where Viedt, a typing expert with thirty years of experience, testified that many documents related to the case came from the machine No. 18715 taken by the police from the defendant's firm, and that one of the digits of the fake check of 188,000 yuan, and one digit of the fake check of 136,688 yuan and 25 jiao (cents), all came from machine No. 1,637,792 in the defendant's office. This machine was also seized by the police. He also claimed that the letters on typewriters each have special characteristics, none are the same, and that any expert can distinguish them without error. The defendant's lawyer then cross-examined him, but Viedt remained steadfast in his testimony. Chief Inspector York of the police then gave a detailed account of his several meetings with the defendant. As it was getting late, the magistrate adjourned the hearing to Tuesday next week. The Portuguese Baptista was also tried by Portuguese Consul-General Xavier, but the details were not known as the hearing was not public. It is only known that the two Russians and three Chinese who had already been convicted by the First Special District Court were summoned to court that day, and then the trial was indefinitely postponed to allow other witnesses to be summoned for questioning.</p>
<h3>Reorganization Record of Two Exchange Houses</h3>
<p>Yifeng Reorganized as Bank</p>
<p>Chunyuan Will Soon Be Settled</p>
<p>This year, there have been many changes in money exchange houses. It is heard that (1) Jixiang Feng Exchange House will be reorganized as a bank this year, with the registered name "Zhengming Commercial Savings Bank." The address will be moved to the new building along the road on Ningbo Road. In addition to the two old shareholders, Zhou and Lin, there will be new shareholders. The capital will be one million yuan, with 500,000 yuan to be paid up first. The opening date is around the end of the month or the beginning of the month. (2) Due to the withdrawal of shareholder Zhu, Chunyuan Exchange House on Shanxi Road had Zhu Shunqing join as a shareholder last night, and the manager of the house, Shen Jinzong, also contributed a share. This will allow the business to continue, and it may be able to open as usual this day in Yue Road. Because the shareholder Huang Zhenrong's side still needs to be dealt with, it is still being reorganized. It is estimated that it will be completed and realized in the near future.</p>

The constable then reported the situation to the chief of the section, who reported it to the Supervision Department of the General Bureau for filing.</p>
<h3>Major Clash in Dachang Militia Due to Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>More Than 100 Shots Fired by Both Sides</p>
<p>Cause Was a Bride Snatching</p>
<p>Yan Quansheng, a coach of the Eighth Jia of the Dachang Town Militia in Baoshan County, had previously been betrothed to the Zhu family of Kangjiazhai, about three li northeast of the town. After entering the family, he left without marrying due to certain reasons. Both the man and the woman have now grown up, the woman being 28 years old this year. The family consists of only an old mother and daughter who live together. On the evening of the 13th of this month, at around 7:00 PM, Yan led more than 20 militiamen to the Zhu family to snatch the bride. They had already snatched Miss Zhu and traveled less than half a li when the villagers of Kangjiazhai heard about it and sounded the alarm with gongs. The surrounding villages, such as Wujiazhuang and Lijialou, suddenly heard the sound of gongs and mistook it for a robbery. In an instant, gongs were sounded everywhere, and the militiamen chased after them. Both sides opened fire, and the sound of gunfire was heard far and wide. The fighting intensified. After about half an hour, the two sides fired hundreds of shots. As a result, Yan was outnumbered and was caught by the Kangjiazhai Militia, who seized Miss Zhu and captured four of Yan Quansheng's militiamen, including Yan Jinsheng. Zhu was outnumbered and retreated. It is now known that the local gentry, Mr. Wang Yingshi, is currently being asked to mediate. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter went to Mr. Wang's residence to inquire. According to his answer, the plan is to first dismiss Coach Yan and fine him ten street lights as a warning and to enforce discipline. According to local villagers, there have been several robberies since last August, and a man named Dai Xiaoheshang was shot and killed by bandits. Therefore, when the villagers hear the sound of gongs, they must rush out to pursue and arrest them.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zhan Jifeng's Home Robbed</h3>
<p>At 7 PM the other night, the residence of the renowned lawyer Zhan Jifeng, located in the Datong Li on Baike Road, was suddenly entered by six bandits who gained entry under false pretenses. They first went to the downstairs side room, produced handguns, and intimidated Zhan's two secretaries, ordering them to remain silent. The secretaries initially refused to yield, resulting in a violent assault. They had no choice but to endure without resistance. The bandits then proceeded upstairs directly to the inner chambers. At that time, Mr. Zhan and his family were out on business. The bandits then ransacked the cabinets and chests at will, engaging in unrestrained looting. Although Zhan had been practicing law in Shanghai for many years, the cost of living in the city was very high, and he barely had enough for sustenance, with little savings. The bandits searched until past 8 PM, but still did not find any valuable items. However, unwilling to have made the trip in vain, they grabbed several legal documents from Zhan's office before fleeing. When Zhan returned home and checked his belongings, he realized that what had been stolen were documents related to cases transferred by the Public Security Bureau to the concession courts. This was because Mr. Zhan also served as a legal advisor to the municipal Public Security Bureau. Zhan has since reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Wen Zongyao's Concubine Case Continues Hearing</h3>
<p>Most witnesses appeared in court to testify</p>
<p>The court ordered the conclusion of the debate and scheduled sentencing for the 19th</p>
<p>Wen Zongyao, who once served as one of the seven Southwest Chief Executives, was sued by Yu Wang, a widow from Hangzhou claiming to be the mother of Jin Yuan (now renamed Shouzhen), for abduction of a minor because Wen took Jin Yuan, a former prostitute, as his concubine. The First Special District Court summoned Wen to appear in court for interrogation. The details have been reported in previous issues. Yesterday afternoon, presiding Judge Wu Zehan held a continued hearing. The plaintiff, Yu Wang and her daughter, claimed illness and did not appear. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a postponement, but the defendant opposed the postponement, arguing that the witnesses had all arrived. After arguments from both sides' lawyers, the court decided to proceed. Tao Rubo, a detective from the Xinzha Police Station, testified that Wen Zongyao reported the escape of his concubine Shouzhen on February 1. He was dispatched to investigate the situation at 584 Da Tong Road and 25 De'an Lane on North Shanxi Road. Next, Chen Wang, a landlady from Da Tong Road, testified that Wen Zongyao rented a three-story loft from her for 15 yuan per month. After the rental was completed, he moved in with Shouzhen. However, Wen only came to the house during the day and never stayed overnight. His concubine initially stayed at home, but on the 25th of the previous month, she suddenly left with a female servant and a trunk of luggage, saying that she was going to the hospital for childbirth. Lao Liu, a former prostitute at 25 De'an Lane, testified that Shouzhen's original name was Jin Yuan, born to the sister of Wang Yang. When the sister died, Jin Yuan was only eight years old, so she was raised by Wang Yang and never knew that she had a biological mother. Two years ago, when Jin Yuan was 24 years old, a Northerner wanted to marry her, but Jin Yuan refused. Later, Wen took her as his concubine, and Wang Yang received a dowry of 1,200 yuan. Zhao Ruixin, who had frequented that brothel, testified that he had visited De'an Lane in 1924 and 1927 and had met Wen there. At that time, Jin Yuan was still young. Finally, the lawyers for both sides mutually debated the original arguments to conclusion. Judge Wu announced that the verdict would be announced on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Construction Factory Owner Ling Songting Sued for Abuse by Concubine</h3>
<p>Ling Songting, the 54-year-old owner of a construction factory located at 135 Route Masnan, French Concession, and a native of Nanhui County, Pudong, has been doing well in business in recent years and has accumulated considerable savings. As a result, he has three wives and concubines at home. Last year, he took a woman from a brothel as his fourth concubine. After the fourth concubine entered the house, Ling began to abuse his third concubine, Cai Jinbao (29 years old, native of Pudong). Because of this, Cai could not bear to live with him and returned to her mother's home. She hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Ling of abandonment and demanding 5,000 yuan in private compensation. She was summoned yesterday afternoon. According to Cai Jinbao, she married Ling as a concubine when she was 19 years old. After entering the house, they lived in harmony. Unexpectedly, after Ling married a prostitute as his fourth concubine last year, he became hostile to her, deprived her of food and necessities, and frequently abused her. On July 23 of last year, he not only beat her but also destroyed the bed, curtains, and clothes in the room. The situation became unbearable, so she returned to her mother's home and requested an investigation and compensation for her to live in a nunnery and cultivate her mind in peace. Ling Songting testified that he treated his wives and concubines equally and did not abuse the plaintiff. He also said the second concubine, Lu Yuezhen, was a witness to his claims. An officer commanded Lu Yuezhen to appear in court, and Lu Yuezhen, age 50, testified that she lived with the plaintiff and others. Last year, the plaintiff and the fourth concubine had a quarrel, so her husband got angry and broke a glass window, but he did not beat the plaintiff. As for the women, each received 5 yuan per month for personal use. Recently, her husband's business has been slow, so he has not paid them, which is true. The officer asked the plaintiff if she had any witnesses to the abuse and abandonment by her husband, and Cai replied that she did not. When asked if she was willing to return home with her husband, she replied that she had been abused and did not want to return. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the defendant had abused and abandoned the plaintiff since marrying his fourth concubine. The plaintiff is lame and completely unable to support herself. The defendant has committed the crime of abandonment under Article 309 of the Criminal Code. The lawyer requested an investigation and compensation. The defendant's lawyer also made a defense. Judge Xiong ruled that the debate was over and declared Ling Songting not guilty and dismissed the plaintiff's private lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Using Bad Checks to Falsify Accounts</h3>
<p>The Dazhong Rubber Overshoe Factory formerly had a Tongmao Overshoe Distribution Center attached to No. 9 Bulinli, French Concession. Li Yuchang was employed as an accountant. At the end of last year, Li colluded with Cai Zhiyuan, who is now on the run, to collect large sums of money from various employers and use them for their own benefit. They then used three bad checks from a certain bank, totaling 2,700 yuan, to deceive Manager Yin Zhijie. Yin discovered the fraud and reported it to the police, who arrested Li at the Dongchang Hotel on Xiafei Road. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer said that the case still needed to be investigated and requested a postponement. The judge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and granted a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhu Zhiyao Accuses Nephew of Misappropriating Public Funds</h3>
<p>Due to mediation by relatives and friends, a request was made to withdraw the case.</p>
<p>The police lawyer said that further research was needed.</p>
<p>The Tongchang Oil Factory at No. 80 Route de la Grande Armée formerly employed Zhu Bingsheng from Shanghai as an accountant. Unexpectedly, during the past year, Zhu misappropriated 5,419 yuan of public funds for his own use. The manager, Zhu Zhiyao, discovered this and reported it to the police, claiming that Zhu had committed the crime of embezzlement under Article 357 of the Criminal Code. The police arrested Zhu and handed him over to the Second Special Court for investigation. The plaintiff's lawyer said that the defendant, Zhu Bingsheng, was the plaintiff's nephew and that relatives and friends had mediated the matter and requested that the case be withdrawn. The police lawyer stood up and stated that the police were in the process of investigating the case and that the plaintiff was suddenly requesting a withdrawal. It was important to study whether this case fell under the category of cases that could only be prosecuted upon complaint, according to the Criminal Code. The judge ordered Zhu to provide a guarantor from his shop who would be available at any time and postponed the case for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Jobless for a Long Time and Struggling to Make a Living</h3>
<p>Cao Baogen Commits Suicide in a Hotel</p>
<p>Cao Baogen, a 24-year-old local man, lived in a bungalow at No. 16 Nankai Road, Caojiadu, West Shanghai. He used to work as a road worker but had been unemployed for a long time due to rheumatic fever and was struggling to make a living. On the 16th (the other day), he checked into the Yong'an Inn in the Chengda Alley on Xintiantong Road. After dinner, he secretly took a lethal dose of something that produced smoke and committed suicide behind everyone's back. The next morning, the inn's tea boy discovered him and rushed him to Tongren Hospital, where he was resuscitated. He died at 2:30 PM. The hospital then sent the body to the coroner's office to await examination by the court.</p>
<h3>Boy Crushed to Death on Shanghai-Taicang Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:50 AM, a passenger bus numbered 24 from Jiading to Shanghai was traveling on the Shanghai-Taicang Road when it arrived at Zhongshan Road North. At that location, people from Jiangbei were performing a lion dance in front of a thatched shed, and many people had gathered on the road to watch. The driver, Lu Axing (27 years old, from Luodian Town), honked his horn urgently and shouted at the people to clear the road. The front of the bus swerved to the west side of the road to pass by. Unexpectedly, Liu Bailiang, the nine-year-old son of Liu Fuzi, a puller of rickshaws from Funing, ran out from the side of the road to defecate on the opposite side of the road and was hit by the rear wheel of the bus, which crushed his head. He died instantly, with blood flowing all over the ground. A security team patrol police arrived at the scene and escorted the driver, Lu Axing, to the 4th District Public Security Bureau. According to the deceased's mother, Liu Shen, she is 31 years old and has a son and a daughter. Besides the deceased son, she only has one daughter named Xiaopenzi, who is only five years old. Her husband is also only 35 years old. They are very poor and are requesting compensation.</p>
<h3>Sun Guochang Dies of Smallpox</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been warm, and many people in the Nanshi and Chenghuang areas have contracted smallpox. Sun Guochang (26 years old), a native of Anhui, lived in the rear building at No. 56 Hunan Railway Station Road. He worked to earn a living and had no relatives in Shanghai. Recently, Sun suddenly contracted smallpox. Although he received medical treatment, it was ineffective, and he died the other day. Since he had no family, the sub-landlord reported the matter to the 2nd District Police Station, which ordered the local security officer Gu Xueyuan to report to the local court for an examination. Prosecutor Li Fen and the examiners arrived on the scene and confirmed that the death was due to smallpox. They filled out the form and ordered that the body be placed in a coffin.</p>

<h3>Modern Cold Leg Disease</h3>
<p>(2) Zhai Shaoheng</p>
<p>Prevention of Cold Legs: We already know that cold legs are caused by the legs being exposed to cold. Therefore, the way to prevent it is simply to keep the legs warm and protect them from the cold. As for whether it looks good or not, fashionable or not, of course, we cannot care about that. However, as long as everyone dresses like this, it won't look bad. Now, I want to first talk about a few things that I can think of:</p>
<p>(1) When going out, shoes and socks should be thick, and the soles of the shoes should preferably be made of felt to prevent cold air from entering the soles of the feet. The trouser legs should be long, and it is best to install a section of elasticated gaiters inside the trousers to prevent the icy northwest wind from blowing straight into the trousers. According to the current general dress, wearing a velvet hat on the head, a leather coat on the body, short silk trousers on the lower body, and thin silk stockings and leather sandals on the feet, it is okay for those who get in and out of cars, but those who take rickshaws will be exposed to the northwest wind, which blows directly on their feet and into their trousers. Even a hot water bottle the size of a fist may not be able to withstand this ruthless cold.</p>
<p>(2) When attending class, schools with good buildings and sufficient funds naturally have floors, cement floors, and radiators, which are very comfortable. However, in general poor schools, the doors and windows are closed but drafty, the stove is there but has no fire, and the ground is damp and made of mud bricks. Being in such a place, sitting from 8:00 in the morning to 5:00 in the afternoon every day, winter after winter, year after year, I am afraid that many people will develop cold legs. Therefore, people studying in poor schools should be prepared to go out and sit in the open air, so as to reduce the harm of being exposed to cold on the legs.</p>
<p>(3) When playing cards, there is no problem in wealthy people's homes. In ordinary people's homes, especially on damp mud bricks, several small benches should always be placed under the table for the card players to rest their feet on. If not, then playing sixteen or twenty-four rounds day and night, until after midnight, when it is almost dawn, you will feel numb hands and cold feet, and a stiff back. This may not be a big problem for a day or two, but if it goes on for years, it will definitely lead to cold legs.</p>
<p>(4) When watching opera and movies, there is of course no problem in fancy theaters. Moreover, fashionable young mistresses and young ladies only watch the last one or two acts of the opera, so the time is not long and the harm is less. However, those opera fans who want to watch from the opening act to the old female character doing the wedding ceremony must wear more clothes on their lower body, because watching opera also involves sitting still. And the equipment of the theaters is ultimately incomplete. If you sit in a drafty place for a long time, it will also be bad. Also, I recently had an experience that is also worth noting. That is, in the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I accidentally went to a certain big theater with my family to watch a movie. I don't need to say that a certain big theater is a fancy theater that everyone knows. Sitting inside, you can forget that it is summer, because there is air conditioning inside. Who knew that I, who had not enjoyed this kind of comfort, felt cold air reaching my waist from my feet in less than half an hour, so my waist hurt, and my stomach hurt. Because I didn't want to spoil the fun of the group, I reluctantly persevered to the end, but I was in great pain. Later, I went there again, and I got the same result again. So I made up my mind not to set foot there again. When I told others about it, many people had the same illness as me. I think people with the same illness and women during menstruation and after childbirth should at least pay attention. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On Current Writing</h3>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>We greatly value your self-study experience. You are using the correct methods for learning to write and collecting vocabulary. (When you get good phrases, you hide them away), (for more than a year) (you have accumulated quite a few newspaper scraps), and then (cut out the words that please you)</p>
<p>, (paste them in a notebook). Naturally, in your environment, it is already quite commendable that you can do this with such care.</p>
<p>As for your lack of understanding of modern writing, it is no wonder, your environment really does not allow you to have much access to (writing). However, we don't think it's a pity for you, because being a person doesn't necessarily mean you have to be good at writing. There are many people with good writing skills who don't understand the ways of the world. I think striving for success in writing is simply unnecessary; but if you learn modern Chinese language to understand (reality), that is a meaningful and necessary thing.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese language undoubtedly has what you said (some classical Chinese mixed with (le) (de) (ma); and colloquial Chinese sometimes inserts classical Chinese words.) In principle, this cannot be said to be bad. The Chinese language is currently in an era of transformation. It needs to expand its new vocabulary, so there is nothing wrong with colloquial Chinese containing classical Chinese words, as long as it is a living reference. As for adding colloquial Chinese to classical Chinese, this proves the decline of classical Chinese. It must maintain the old style and old words, which can never exist and be popular. However, in the current types of writing, there are already many purely beautiful colloquial writings, and colloquial writing has long been firmly established in China.</p>
<p>(Every sentence in the colloquial style seems to be broken up, even every word cannot be put down.) This is probably because you are too deeply influenced by classical Chinese and are not very close to colloquial Chinese, otherwise, you are indeed reading the worst works.</p>
<p>In modern colloquial Chinese, there are two types of writing that are more difficult to read. The first type is divided into two types: one is writing that implies more than it says, or so-called (humorous) writing, (such as the works of Lin Yutang, Lu Xun, etc.), and the other is meticulously descriptive writing; (such as the works of Xu Zhimo, etc.). The other type is translated writing.</p>
<p>The (difficulty) of the former is not only in the writing, but also in whether your emotions can understand the lofty emotions contained in a work of art, and whether it can arouse resonance? The latter also requires your academic ability, whether you are completely unfamiliar with the content contained in a certain work? Or do you have some foundation? So you can't misunderstand that you don't understand the writing because you don't understand the theory! However, we also know that there are indeed some (incomprehensible), (stiff), (too Europeanized) problems in the current translations. This is partly because the translator's ability is too low, and partly because of the shortcomings of the Chinese language itself. In short, this is a temporary phenomenon, which can be avoided after the end of the future language reform. We cannot oppose (foreign words), (foreign styles), (precise long sentence structure) because there are a few difficult-to-read translations!</p>
<p>(Which one is the standard), but it cannot be determined. But for beginners, it is still best to start with pure colloquial language. If you must point out a (typical) one, I think Guo Moruo's prose is the most fluent type in colloquial language. You can find one of his prose collections to read!</p>
<p>The piece of writing you attached is a rather simple essay. There are many such writings now. You can go to our book catalog to find (essays) (modern literary collections) books, which are guaranteed to satisfy your interest.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to remind you in particular is: you don't have to seek success in writing, you should take learning modern writing as a means of studying other subjects. (Please refer to the article on learning languages ​​published in this column on February 7th and 8th.)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Defeats Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Unexpected Defeat Amidst Great Momentum: Hong Kong has suffered two defeats, not confined to being surrounded by enemies, but losing in the midst of great momentum. Yesterday's match between Tianjin and Hong Kong was particularly evident. When the two armies were fighting, Hong Kong's forwards entered the zone, each showing their skills, and frequently shooting. However, Tianjin's defense was strict, and it was difficult to achieve their goals. They visited again and again, and again and again. Although they were diligent, they did not hit the vital points, and in the end, it did not help the overall situation. Tianjin's army, under the effort of resisting, occasionally looked back, and the forwards were able to enter empty, and go down in one fell swoop, relying entirely on proper use, not on the number of attacks.</p>
<p>Tianjin's Midfield Maintains Victory: Tianjin's goalkeeper's performance yesterday was very satisfactory, saving countless dangerous balls. Midfielder Heil had both a copper head and iron legs. He relied on his head to save the situation twice, which amazed the audience. The left and right assistants did not seem to be effective, so they were greatly oppressed by the enemy, and they stayed for a long time. Fortunately, the inner guards were stronger than before, and loopholes were difficult to find. In the eventful times, they were unharmed. It was due to their strength. The five forwards were sharp, and Jones's achievements were above Johansson. The wings were monitored by people, but they were still able to move as before.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Goalkeeper Ruins the Overall Situation: Hong Kong's five forwards were all very active, and the left-winger Ho Gart was even more outstanding, with long passes and short passes, all of which were excellent. His shots were accurate and fast, making him the crown of the five forwards. The most dangerous person in the Hong Kong team, left inside Redliff, covered both inside and outside, echoed the left wing, and jointly attacked. The Tianjin team lost its color every time. Right winger Xiaogao Shannu was also as free as before. Dagao Shannu and Tam Kong Pak were still agile, but lacked the final blow, resulting in failure, and they could only sigh helplessly. The three-man center-back line was able to cope with it easily. The left and right inner guards were positioned too far forward. Whenever the Tianjin forwards, who were incomparably fast, broke through, they could not turn around in time. The goalkeeper showed weakness and repeatedly failed. He should bear more than half of the responsibility.</p>
<p>One Goal Each in Ten Minutes: Referee Yue Sau Wing blew the whistle to declare war. Hong Kong kicked off and progressed. After three or four exchanges, Tam Kong Pak dribbled the ball into the zone and passed it diagonally to the center. Tianjin's right inner guard could not take care of it. Dagao Shannu saw the opportunity and made a decisive shot, hitting the goal directly. Hong Kong won this goal in just five minutes. In the blink of an eye, Tianjin's Jones flew in, kicked to the left, and center Roger stepped out in front of the crowd, without thinking, added a kick. Within ten minutes, a 1-1 draw was created. Hong Kong's left-winger, Ho Gart, was still active under strict surveillance. He sent a long ball to the left, and Xiaogao Shannu greeted the ball and attacked the goal. Tianjin's goalkeeper was agile, and bent down to catch it. Tam Kong Pak and Dagao Shannu repeatedly pounced, but they were all saved.</p>
<p>The Forwards Gain the Upper Hand, the Defense is Empty: Hong Kong's right-winger Xiaogao Shannu jumped into the periphery, and the entire line followed in, forming a line formation, surrounding the Tianjin goal. The Tianjin team densely deployed heavy troops, and guarded the key points. At this time, the Hong Kong team's arrogance was incomparable, and the center-back line was also transferred to the front, increasing the attacking power, and the inner guards moved to the center line, remotely responding. Unexpectedly, under the great momentum, a sudden disaster descended. Tianjin's right-winger, Fincher Switzerland, passed and received the ball appropriately. Center Roger carried it and advanced quickly, passing sideways to Jones. There was no one on the left or right. Jones calmly shot in, taking the lead with two to one. Hong Kong worked hard and achieved nothing, which was not as good as Tianjin's three passes and four passes, which immediately succeeded. It was also the difference between good luck and bad luck.</p>
<p>An Occasional Visit Again Announces Victory: Hong Kong's Xiaogao Shannu made a horizontal pass in front of the goal, and Redliff greeted it with his head. Tianjin's goalkeeper pushed it backward, and Xiaogao Shannu took a corner kick, which was excellent, and was headed out by center-back Heil while falling to the ground, resolving the dangerous situation. Taking this opportunity, Tianjin launched a counter-attack. Left-winger Archier passed to the right-winger. The right-winger hit the goal post, bounced to Jones's chest, and shot towards the goal, succeeding again. Tianjin then took the lead with three to one. Xiaogao Shannu was brave and directly attacked the Tianjin goal. The goalkeeper lightly lifted the ball upwards, and the waves calmed down. Hong Kong continued to attack, but was always turned away. In the last attack, Tam Kong Pak had avoided Heil, but the shot hit the goalkeeper's chest. In the first half, Tianjin led 3-1.</p>
<p>Photo of Tianjin and Hong Kong Teams (Taken by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>One Goal Gained Through Hardship: Not long after the start of the second half, Ho Gart entered unnoticed and calmly picked the ball. Around the Tianjin goal, heavy troops defended. The three generals in the middle of the Hong Kong team seemed to be wandering on a forked road, not knowing where to go. The attacking routes were all cut off. Redliff suddenly stood out, but the ball was caught by the goalkeeper again. The attack was fierce and terrifying, and the defense was tight and amazing. Hong Kong's Ho Gart was almost the leader of every attack. At 25 minutes, he picked the ball in front of the goal, and Xiaogao Shannu jumped out of the crowd, leaning forward and heading the ball, falling into the net. The score became two to three.</p>
<p>Fierce Attacks Backfire: Hong Kong, with only one goal behind, became more and more diligent, hoping to seek victory from failure. The courage of the attacks was even more fierce than before, but their unfortunate incidents continued to occur. Dagao Shannu was hit on the head twice, but was still able to fight. Tam Kong Pak was injured in the leg and eventually had to be carried off the field. After Hong Kong was two to three, the armored cavalry came across the field again. Xiaogao Shannu picked the ball, but Tam Kong Pak delayed, and the Tianjin team was able to calmly defend and pass safely. Jones then rode in quickly, and the ball advanced from right to left. Center Roger jumped up and headed the ball, flying into the sky. As time was about to end, Hong Kong attacked very quickly, and the left side performed particularly well. The picked balls were endless. There were two sharp shots, launched 15 yards in front of the Tianjin goal, all of which were blocked by Heil with his bald head. The situation suddenly changed. Tianjin's Johansson broke into the territory alone, and the Hong Kong goalkeeper personally resisted. Roger continued to advance and scored another goal. As a result, Tianjin won Hong Kong 4-2.</p>

<h3>Shanghai and Tianjin Get Equal Points</h3>
<p>The Final Battle is Abandoned: In the Shanghai-Tianjin-Hong Kong triangular interport competition, Shanghai drew with Tianjin on the first day, Shanghai won Hong Kong on the second day, and Tianjin won Hong Kong yesterday. Shanghai and Tianjin each won once and drew once, with equal points. The (Hong Kong Telegraph) Cup, which Shanghai and Hong Kong competed for, was kept by Shanghai for one year. As for the interport championship, Shanghai and Tianjin shared the world equally. In principle, there should be a final battle, but it was abandoned because Tianjin was leaving Shanghai tonight. The results of the three battles are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Played Won Draw Lost Goals For Goals Against Points</p>
<p>Shanghai Twice 1 1 0 9 goals 5 goals 3 points</p>
<p>Tianjin Twice 1 1 0 7 goals 5 goals 3 points</p>
<p>Hong Kong Twice 0 0 2 4 goals 10 goals 0 points</p>
<h3>Overall Trend of Championships Over the Years</h3>
<p>This is the Second Grand Event: The term "interport competition" was created in 1908. The Shanghai and Hong Kong Western Football Clubs were the main participants. The first Hong Kong-Shanghai competition was held in Hong Kong, and five years later, in 1913, it was moved to Shanghai. It was suspended for several years due to the European War. In 1924, Hankou sent a team to Shanghai to participate once. Since then, it seems to have become a swan song. It is unknown when it will be able to restore its former glory. In 1928, Tianjin began to compete with Shanghai in interport games. In 1930, Hong Kong, Tianjin, and Shanghai met for the first time in Shanghai, creating an unprecedented grand occasion in the history of interport games. In the following two years, Tianjin remained inactive. In this session, the three heroic divisions met again in Shanghai, which is the second great event of interport games.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Team Still Needs to Work Hard: Looking at the competitions over the years, a statistic shows that Shanghai has played against Hong Kong 14 times, Shanghai has won 9 times, and Hong Kong has won 5 times. Hong Kong has played against Tianjin twice, each winning once. Tianjin has played against Shanghai 4 times, Tianjin has won twice, Shanghai has won once, and drawn once. In addition, Shanghai and Hong Kong have each won against Hankou once. On average, Shanghai has won more than it has lost. In reality, Tianjin's football skills are advancing rapidly, and Hong Kong's talents are emerging one after another. Shanghai cannot be optimistic and still needs to work hard to maintain its glory in the future. The results of previous years are attached on the left:</p>

<h3>A Record of the Interport Banquet</h3>

Shanghai and Tianjin each received a small silver cup, and the captains of the two teams, Xu and Jehan Son, also received one each. Then, Acheson, on behalf of the thanking, thanked the three referees who executed the referee, Linus Boto and Yue Sau Wing, and especially addressed Yue Sau Wing three times, saying that Yue Jun was the first Chinese to execute the referee in the history of the Shanghai Interport Football Tournament, and praised Yue Jun's refereeing skills, saying that he did not discriminate based on nationality, etc. Again, Shen Siliang spoke on behalf of the Physical Association and representatives of journalists gave speeches.

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association Qingguang Loses to Brave</h3>
<p>Daxia Wins Artillery Team 49 to 37</p>
<p>Brave Wins Qingguang 37 to 19</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held a total of four games last night, with Group A accounting for three of them. As a result, Group B Nanshang won Meitong 31-20, and both sides performed very well. Nanshang always took the lead, and the score difference was often between three or four points. In the second half, Nanshang became more active, and Meitong closely followed, but failed to exceed the score. However, the tension of the situation and the beauty of the performance were no less than those of the Group A games. In the three Group A games, Feixia gave up, and Chizhi won without any effort. In the remaining two games, Daxia won Artillery 49-37, and Brave won Qingguang 37-19.</p>
<p>Daxia Wins Artillery Team: The Artillery team relied on Tie Niu to preside over the center, and initially gained the upper hand. They once led by a score of 16 to 8. Daxia temporarily succumbed. Soon, Chen and Lu's two forwards repeatedly scored, and the score soared. The Artillery team was unwilling to show weakness, and He Yanzhang and Chen Baoqiu also made achievements. In the first half, the Artillery team led by two points. In the second half, Daxia fought more and more fiercely, and the Artillery team gradually became unsustainable. As a result, 49-37, Daxia reversed the defeat into victory</p>

<p>In the second group, except for losing to Mai Ling and Zhanghua, they won every game. Last night, all the players of Qingguang played, and Dong Xiaopei's majestic style remained. First to score was Bai Luosha, who returned two points. Both sides were evenly matched and refused to give in. In the first half, ten to nine, Brave took the lead by one point. When the battle resumed, Qingguang gradually became tired and difficult to build. Looking back at Brave, one after another, the score soared. As a result, 37-19, Qingguang was defeated miserably.</p>

<h3>Outlying Areas</h3>
<p>Hangzhou City Elementary Schools Fight for Independent Education Funds</p>
<p>Request to Designate Residential Housing Donations as Special Funds for Municipal Education</p>
<p>The Hangzhou City education funds have traditionally been incorporated into the municipal budget without specific designated funds. Consequently, education funding fluctuates with the city's overall financial gains and losses, lacking reliable guarantees. This hinders expansion plans like adding schools and classes. To address this deficiency, the principals of the city's elementary schools have proposed that only independent education funding can facilitate educational progress. Therefore, they have resolved to petition the municipal government to designate the Hangzhou City store and residential housing donations as special education funds. This would ensure that municipal education achieves substantial advancement.</p>
<h3>Film Censorship Committee to Switch to Full-Time Members Next Year</h3>
<p>The Film Censorship Committee, jointly formed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, currently consists of seven members. These members are assigned concurrently from within the ministries and receive salaries from their respective departments. The committee members receive only a monthly allowance of thirty yuan per person for transportation. The committee has over ten additional staff members, with annual expenses totaling several thousand yuan. Each film screening requires the attendance of all seven committee members, along with three instructors dispatched by the Central Propaganda Department. The approval of a film requires at least one instructor from the Central Propaganda Department to sign off. Following a proposal by a committee member to convert the committee to full-time membership (requiring members to be full-time, proficient in foreign languages, and have received higher education), the matter has been submitted to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education for review. Sources indicate that representatives from both ministries recently met within the Ministry of Interior and have, in principle, accepted the reform. However, the change to full-time membership is contingent upon budget considerations, as the Committee's budget for the 22nd year does not include provisions for this. (Currently, the members assigned by both ministries are mostly foreign-educated students who have received higher education and are proficient in several languages, with monthly salaries ranging from three to four hundred yuan. If converted to full-time status, they would no longer receive salaries from their departments. Even at a minimum salary of three hundred yuan, the total for seven members would be over two thousand yuan per month.) Therefore, it has been decided that the rationale behind this decision, along with the qualifications and experience of the current members from both ministries, will be jointly reported to the Executive Yuan. It is said that this matter will be managed by the Central Propaganda Committee in the future.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to Dispatch Personnel to Inspect Primary, Secondary, and Social Education Throughout the Province</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Orders County Education Bureau Chiefs to Conduct Inspections in Rural Areas, Emphasizing Prompt Implementation</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to all County Education Bureaus stating: "It has been found that inspections of rural education by the heads of education bureaus are crucial for promoting the development of education throughout the county. Orders have been issued to follow the regulations promulgated by the department and to implement them promptly, and to submit reports on the results of the inspections for review. Now that the second semester of this year has already begun, it is observed that very few bureau chiefs have complied with the regulations during the last semester. It is noted that the education bureau chiefs of Qingpu, Taicang, Yixing, and Qidong counties have all conducted two rural inspections and submitted two reports, demonstrating diligent work that deserves commendation to encourage others. The counties of Changshu, Kunshan, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Shanghai, Xinghua, and Gaochun have submitted reports and should continue to implement the policy. The remaining counties have only reported conducting rural inspections without submitting reports and should immediately expedite the submission of reports for review. There are also those who have neither complied with the order to conduct rural inspections nor provided an explanation, showing complete disregard, which is unacceptable. For now, a lenient warning is issued. Starting this semester, efforts must be made to implement the regulations and, upon completion of the inspections, reports must be submitted for review. If there is any disregard, strict disciplinary action will be taken upon discovery. Each should comply diligently."</p>

<h3>Categorized Statistics of the Vocational Guidance Center's Activities Over the Years</h3>
<p>Few Professional Talents Placed in Jobs</p>
<p>Most Guidance for Students Entering Higher Education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society has been established for six years since its founding in September 1927. The following is a categorized statistical summary of its various activities:</p>
<p>Job Placement: 803 people in 1927, 1,286 people in 1928, 3,974 people in 1929, 6,203 people in 1930, 7,183 people in 1931, 7,179 people in 1932, and 7,981 people in 1933 (up to June), totaling 34,609 people. Among these 34,609 people, job placement accounted for 70%, vocational guidance accounted for 15%, and career changes accounted for 15%. Discussions with professional talents accounted for only 20% of the cases. This 20% indicates that finding a job is not difficult, but rather that there is a lack of specialized skills.</p>
<p>Guidance for Higher Education: 55 people in 1927, 549 people in 1928, 1,160 people in 1929, 2,140 people in 1930, 2,672 people in 1931, 1,549 people in 1932, and 1,422 people in 1933, totaling 9,547 people. Among these 9,547 people, university students accounted for 40%, middle school students accounted for 50%, and primary school students accounted for 10%, indicating that vocational guidance is most needed at the middle school level.</p>
<p>Personal Consultations: Including legal, health, and marital matters, 26 people in 1927, 58 people in 1928, 108 people in 1929, 198 people in 1930, 324 people in 1931, 350 people in 1932, and 363 people in 1933, totaling 1,428 people. The above statistics show a steady increase in the number of people receiving such consultations over the years. Those seeking vocational consultations mostly requested job placement.</p>
<p>Registration Qualifications: The qualifications of those who registered at the center are summarized as follows: 3,545 graduates from domestic and foreign universities, 2,473 graduates from vocational schools, 2,072 graduates from normal schools, 2,399 graduates from secondary vocational schools, 2,668 graduates from secondary schools, 1,852 students who attended but did not graduate from secondary schools, and 1,021 others, totaling 16,030 people. Among the registrants, graduates from domestic and foreign universities with special technical skills were the most numerous, while those who attended but did not graduate from secondary schools and lacked the ability to continue their education were the least numerous. Men accounted for 88.4% and women accounted for 11.6%. Among those successfully placed, the most common occupation was education, followed by commerce, industry, and public service. The most common positions were teachers, accountants, clerks, shop assistants, and trainees, followed by engineers, technicians, and ticket sellers.</p>
<p>Job Placement Success: The statistics for those successfully placed after registering are as follows: 810 school teachers, 510 government agency employees, 283 factory employees and apprentices, 391 store employees and trainees, 150 ticket sellers, and 72 others, totaling 2,216 people. The above statistics show that out of over 16,000 people who entrusted the center with job placement, over 2,200 were successfully placed, nearly two-tenths of the total.</p>
<p>Agency Services: The statistics for various services entrusted by other locations are as follows: 284 planning projects, 434 investigation projects, 72 talent examination projects, 1,963 talent scouting projects, and 2,496 talent testing projects. On average, there were over ten planning and investigation projects per month. The average number of talent scouting projects was thirty per month. In the early years of operation, the number of talent scouting projects was relatively small, but in recent years, it has been around fifty per month. The number of talent examination and testing projects, which are temporary in nature, has also been increasing year by year.</p>
<p>Other Guidance: 1,285 people received health guidance, 923 people received legal guidance, service guidance was provided 15 times, and vocational lectures were given 176 times. Service guidance was provided through discussion groups, with leaders and experts from various industries invited to speak. Each session attracted one to two hundred people. These discussion groups and lectures can be generally categorized as vocational training, with over a thousand people receiving training each year.</p>
<p>Published Books: The following books have been published: (1) Overview of Vocational Guidance Implementation, (2) Collection of Vocational Guidance Lectures, (3) Summary of Industry Conditions, (4) Beekeeping Guidance, (5) Chicken Raising Guidance, (6) Vocational Problems, (7) Performance Evaluation Methods, (8) South Seas Service Guide, (9) Higher Education Guide, (10) Higher Education and Employment Guidance, (11) Health and Legal Guidance, (12) Collection of Examination Questions, (13) Youth Vocational Guidance, (14) Youth Higher Education Guidance, (15) Youth Service Guidance, (16) Youth Reading Guidance, (17) Service Ethics, (18) The Road to Success for Youth, (19) Vocational Guidance, (20) The Mother of an Intelligent Child, (21) How to Get a Job, (22) Records of a Trip to the East.</p>

<h3>Several Announcements Regarding Gold Exchange Settlement Prices</h3>
<p>The method for settling gold prices in April has been agreed upon. The Gold Exchange issued several announcements on February 10th. The main points were covered in the extra edition of this newspaper on the 13th. To provide readers with a comprehensive understanding, the original text is supplemented below:</p>
<p>(1) Revised Settlement for April: Due to the reduction in the weight of US gold coins starting from February 1st of this year, the trading methods for February and March have been announced to the market. All new transactions for April are scheduled to begin trading on the 20th of this month. The various methods for regular trading until the end of the period for settlement were consulted with the Brokers Association. The Association responded that they had convened a general meeting of brokers on the 7th of this month to discuss and pass the resolution. The various methods are listed below: (1) New transactions for April are scheduled to begin trading on February 20th and will be handled as follows: The gold content of current US gold coins is still 50%. Each yuan weighs 15.1381 grains, equivalent to 0.315971 li, which is 0.0284375 taels. (2) For all regular trading until the end of the period, if the goods have not been delivered, the settlement will be based on the initial US dollar exchange rate quoted by HSBC on that day, plus expenses, with 346 US dollars per bar.</p>
<p>(2) April Weights Changed to Market Standards: Following government orders, the new system of weights and measures will be used. All transactions at the exchange will uniformly switch to the market standard starting from February 10th. It is hereby announced that each market tael is equal to 0.8525 Cao taels.</p>
<p>(3) February and March will still be calculated using Cao taels: The purchase and sale of metals for the February and March periods will still be calculated using Cao taels, and the transaction price will also be based on Cao taels until the end of the period. From the beginning of new transactions in April, the transaction price will be based on market taels.</p>
<p>(4) Red Gold Settlement Changed to Customs Gold: Starting from February 20th, for all red gold sales at the exchange where the delivery date is specified, if the goods cannot be delivered at the appointed time, the settlement will be based on the initial customs gold price quoted by the Central Bank on that day, with 514 customs gold dollars per bar of 99% red gold. This is hereby announced. (Note: One customs gold dollar is equivalent to 0.019159 market taels. 514 customs gold dollars are equivalent to ten market taels of 99% red gold.)</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Amidst Talk of Silver Price Revision</p>
<p>New York Bonds Speculatively Bought, Prices Rise</p>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm on the 16th stated: The New York stock market was relatively stagnant. Towards the end, prices rose due to short covering. Exchange authorities sent questionnaires to various brokers, requesting truthful reports on recent transactions in aviation stocks. Consequently, the market entered a period of consolidation. Mining stocks were consistently strong throughout the day. Silver mining stocks initially rose but later eased. The price of large silver bars reached $0.46, the highest peak in four years, due to rumors in the American West and Shanghai that Washington would soon take action on silver. However, this claim could not be verified. Furthermore, a secretary of Roosevelt in Washington stated that he was unaware of anything. Nevertheless, reports indicated that the government was about to revise and increase the price of silver. Bond prices rose due to active speculative and investment buying. Daily trading volume reached 2.77 million shares. (Wheat) Market conditions were quiet, with all parties awaiting more accurate reports on harvest losses. (Cotton) Prices were firm due to successful reports of voluntary acreage reduction and supporters of the朋克海案(朋克海案, likely referring to a contemporary policy or legal case) predicted its implementation. The foundation was strong. Textile mills were calm, with factory purchases decreasing by 295,000 bales. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 108.61 Up 0.31</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 52.01 Up 0.17</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 29.03 Down 0.13</p>
<p>40 Bonds 92.39 Up 0.40</p>
<p>11 Commodities 55.11 Up 0.19</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Imports Decreased Last Year</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton Consumption Remains Good</p>
<p>Transactions Reached Over 266,000 Bales</p>
<p>Over 411,000 Bales of 通姚 Cotton Arrived at the Docks</p>
<p>Cash consumption of cotton in 1933 was good. According to market records, the annual total was 189,258 pieces (each piece weighing 500 pounds), equivalent to 266,108 bales (calculated at 120 catties per bale). Last year's foreign cotton imports were lower than the previous year, mainly due to the sluggish yarn market and a relatively abundant domestic cotton harvest. There are concerns that imports may gradually increase in the first half of this year, as華棉(華棉, likely refers to domestic cotton) inventories are becoming increasingly depleted. The government's subsidized purchase of American cotton is too expensive, with only tens of thousands of bales arriving in Shanghai, and a large batch has yet to be imported. Furthermore, the recent intense promotion of acreage reduction in the United States has intensified the upward trend in the cotton market. At the end of last year, spot "Middling" cotton rose from $0.1035 to a peak of $0.1265 on February 10th. Indian cotton prices were the first to rise due to the successful 中印 agreement. The price of 白洛區 cotton for April-May delivery rose from 174 rupees 25 to a peak of 115 rupees 5 on February 10th. The speed of the price surge in the overseas cotton market exceeded expectations. At the same time, the domestic market was also stimulated by foreign cotton prices, and because it was the end of the lunar year and rivers were frozen, transportation was difficult, and sources were depleted, triggering speculative purchases. In February, standard cotton rose from $39.75 on December 28th of last year to $44 on February 9th. At this time, market sentiment was extremely positive, as high foreign cotton prices made imports difficult and domestic cotton was insufficient to meet demand, resulting in a particularly favorable situation. However, the yarn market suffered from an unfavorable environment, and its rising power was weaker, resulting in sluggish factory sales. The future depends on the trends in foreign cotton. Dock arrivals of cotton throughout the year in 1933 totaled 267,511 bales of 姚花 and 143,783 bales of 通州花. A list of the transaction volumes and highest and lowest prices of spot cotton purchased by various factories throughout the year is provided below for reference:</p>

<p>[Silk and Tea]</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Progress Awaits</p>
<p>English Tussah Silk Experiences Sharp Rise British silk mills have already restricted the use of Japanese silk. As the demand for raw materials for spring silk fabrics increases, the Chinese silk market is showing improvement. Tussah silk prices have risen sharply, with Grade A 繡麟飛馬牌 (Embroidered Unicorn Flying Horse Brand) priced at 7 shillings 6 pence per pound and Grade B 黑獅牌 (Black Lion Brand) also at 7 shillings, both up by 6 pence. Calculated in Chinese currency, the price per bale has increased by 40 to 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Sichuan Silk Supply Disrupted The supply of Sichuan yellow silk has been scarce since last winter. In the past half month, shipments to Shanghai have been rare. Local Sichuan silk merchants recently received letters from producing areas stating that this is due to shallow water levels in the upper Yangtze River, making navigation difficult. Normal shipments will resume only after spring water levels rise.</p>
<p>Foreign Silk Market Inactive Due to Spring Holiday The local foreign silk market is inactive as foreign firms are closed for the Spring Festival holiday. They have not yet fully returned to work as of yesterday and will only resume business next Monday. Therefore, European and American silk sales have halted. Yesterday, only the Shanghai Silk Factory purchased 30 bales of yellow and white factory silk, and prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Hankou Soybean Cakes Transferred to Shantou and Xiamen</p>
<p>Soybean cakes are considered the best fertilizer for Chinese farmers. They are produced in North China's Dalian and along the Yangtze River in Hankou, as well as in Qingkou and Haizhou in northern Jiangsu. In recent years, sales of soybean cakes have been slightly sluggish due to competition from imported chemical fertilizers. Chemical fertilizers are most widely sold in South China. However, starting last month, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places have been purchasing large quantities of soybean cakes, all from Hankou. Therefore, recently, ships arriving in Shanghai from Hankou have been carrying mainly soybean cakes for transfer to South China. It is reported that about 200,000 cakes have already been exported, and another 400,000 to 500,000 cakes are waiting to be loaded in Hankou for transshipment in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>Hardware Industry Profits Not Weak</p>
<p>The business situation of the hardware industry in 1933, viewed in the context of all industries, was still relatively satisfactory. Therefore, more companies made profits, and fewer closed down. Most goods were profitable in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, due to the influx of Japanese goods, items such as plain sheet iron and new lead wire suffered slight losses. However, overall, substantial profits were still earned. According to investigations, the most profitable companies include Yuxianglong, Yidamao, Fengyong, Tongchang, Ruichang, Shunheng, Daxing, Xiangyuan, Chunyi, and Changchangji, totaling over ten companies. Their profits ranged from 120,000-130,000 to 30,000-40,000. The next tier includes Cheng Yu Hong, Chengtai Shun, He Rui Xin, Shun Xintai, Zhengji, Qiantai, Xiang Shun Kang Rui Da, totaling twenty to thirty companies. Their profits also ranged from 10,000-20,000 to 30,000-40,000. Furthermore, some companies have not yet finalized their accounts, or are keeping them secret, so details are not fully known. However, most companies made profits, and very few suffered losses.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Golden Rooster Yarn Standard Still Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>Brokerage side is still not unified</p>
<p>Although it was previously rumored in the market that the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange would open the bidding for Golden Rooster Yarn as the standard on February 19th, some brokers were concerned about the interests of future operations and could not reach a consensus. Therefore, brokers convened another meeting on February 10th, but no practical solution was reached.</p>
<p>According to another source, although the board of directors has decided to proceed with the plan, the brokers have not fully approved it, so the new standard is unlikely to be launched on February 19th.</p>

<h3>Why Should We Study?</h3>
<p>— Nan Cun</p>
<p>Little friends, why do you want to study? This is worth exploring. Think about it yourself. What is the reason?</p>
<p>People always have a purpose and a hope in doing anything. Following the purpose and hope, they move forward and gradually achieve satisfactory results. What is the purpose and hope of studying?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yangming, a great Confucian scholar of our country, had already clearly stated this question when he was a primary school student. I will tell you, please pay attention.</p>
<p>When Wang Yangming was very young, he was studying in a private school. He asked the teacher why he wanted to study. The teacher replied that studying would allow him to obtain fame and wealth. Wang Yangming said that this was not the case, it was for learning the methods of (being a person). The teacher greatly appreciated this. Later, Wang Yangming became a great Confucian scholar. It is truly rare that he had such insightful views at a young age.</p>
<p>Japan's national strength comes from Wang Yangming's doctrines (innate knowledge) and (unity of knowledge and action), and the Japanese themselves admit it. Wang Yangming was a virtuous man of our China in the past. We Chinese do not study his doctrines, and do not follow them, but instead the Japanese learn them. Is this not a strange tale? There is a book (Wang Yangming) in the children's books of the bookstore, you can buy a copy and read it to get a general idea. As for the complete works written by Yangming, you cannot understand them clearly now, and you cannot read so much. Wait until your level increases in the future, then study them!</p>
<p>As for how to be a person, what is said in the books you have read is all teaching you to do as they say. If the things you usually do feel very bad, and are inconsistent with the books, then you must change them. This is called (applying what you have learned).</p>
<h3>That Day of School Opening</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Today our school opened, and in the morning, I got up very early. After finishing breakfast, I immediately carried my books and went to school. On the way, I ran into many old classmates, so we ran into a large group, and everyone walked to school together. At this time, there was a lot of unspeakable joy in my heart.</p>
<p>After we entered the school, we saw many more classmates. They were smiling, shouting, and jumping. Everyone was wearing new clothes and was very happy.</p>
<p>Later, the bell rang ding-ding-dong, meaning that the school opening ceremony was about to be held. So all of us students, like waves, poured into the large auditorium.</p>
<p>After the various ceremonies were completed, our Principal took the stage to speak. It seemed that his voice always carried a smile. I stood on tiptoes to look over and saw his mouth moving slowly.</p>
<p>What Principal行(Principal Xing) was saying was (telling us to be good students, to study hard, not to play truant, to respect teachers, and to be as kind and loving to each other as our own brothers); and many other things, I can't remember them all at the moment.</p>
<p>In addition, there were also several teachers who took the stage to speak, and they also seemed very happy, always with smiling faces, their eyes looking at us one wink at a time.</p>
<p>Today the school is full of a new atmosphere. Today is the school opening, today is the happiest day for many teachers, and also the happiest day for many students, and also my happiest day!</p>
<p>Today, my mother also invited guests over, giving me many biscuits and candies. Today seems to be her happiest day too.</p>
<h3>Dad Has</h3>
<p>— Zui Zhu</p>
<p>Hezhen came back from school, threw down her schoolbag, and jumped and ran to her father, asking for ten copper coins, and took her ball to play at the door.</p>
<p>Far away, she saw Ah San from the cobbler's house and Ah Er, who collected cigarette butts, walking hand in hand and laughing happily at the entrance of the alley. Hezhen turned her head and pursed her lips. She thought: These two poor children are really annoying. The tactless Ah San shouted loudly behind her:</p>
<p>(Hey! Hezhen, do you have any copper coins?) Ah Er and Ah San sold the cigarette butts they had collected today and got ten copper coins. They came here specifically to show them to Hezhen.</p>
<p>(Yes! I have ten!) Hezhen suddenly turned around and stretched out her little hand, answering very proudly.</p>
<p>(We also have ten each!) Ah Er and Ah San also stretched out their black hands together, shouting triumphantly!</p>
<p>(You two only have ten: I alone have ten. And my dad has, do you have a dad who has?) Hezhen said angrily, wanting to outdo these two poor children.</p>
<p>Ah Er smiled lightly and said: (You rely on your dad, I rely on my hands. If your dad doesn't give you any, you won't have any);</p>
<p>Ah San also echoed with a smile (Sometimes a dad is not as good as a hand, it's most lasting to earn money with your own hands.)</p>
<p>The two of them, like singing a song of victory, clapped their hands, laughed, sang, and left. Before leaving, they also made a funny face to shame Hezhen.</p>
<p>At this time, Hezhen could only grumble to herself (Dad has! Dad has.)</p>
<h3>The Structure of a Watch</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Zhi'er is a bright and lively child, so in this autumn semester, he studied hard, and the report card sent by the school will certainly not be without progress, and he is ranked first in his grade. Teachers praised him, and parents loved him.</p>
<p>His parents happily bought him a watch as a reward for studying hard.</p>
<p>Zhi'er was very happy with his shiny pocket watch, often staring at it blankly, feeling that the hands on the watch face would move, and at the same time he heard the ticking sound, which was really wonderful.</p>
<p>He became curious again, and asked his brother, Huier, in surprise: (Brother, look! How do these three hands move? Listen! Why is there a ticking sound? Brother, can you answer me?)</p>
<p>Huier thought for a while and replied to him: (Little brother! The longest hand is called the minute hand: the short hand is called the hour hand: the shortest hand is called the second hand. Inside the watch are gears, a spring, and a hairspring. Each swing of the hairspring takes a certain amount of time, called the isochronism of the swing. Each swing is counted as one second. When it swings, it causes the gears to rotate, driving the hour and minute hands to indicate the time. The spring uses the elasticity of steel to keep the hairspring swinging continuously. The teeth around the gears mesh with the teeth of another gear. If one gear rotates, all the other gears also rotate. The ticking sound is the sound made when the hairspring is swinging. If you want to keep your watch from breaking forever, there are two ways: One, do not open the watch case often, to prevent dirt from entering, as the gears will gradually stop. Two, wind the spring tightly, and do it at a fixed time.)</p>
<p>Zhi'er happily hid the watch and went outside to play.</p>
<h3>The Hunter and the Woodcutter</h3>
<p>— Yin Lie</p>
<p>A hunter was searching for lion tracks in the mountains and forests. He met a woodcutter and asked him if he had seen any lion tracks, and if he knew where the lion was hiding. The woodcutter said:</p>
<p>(Hey, I can point out a live lion to you.) When the hunter heard this, his face turned pale and his teeth chattered. He said:</p>
<p>How to draw an elephant Two egg shapes and a tail Four legs and one ear Add some Oh, it's you!</p>
<p>(I just want to see the lion's tracks; I don't want to see a live lion.)</p>
<p>There are so many people in the world who are only brave in words and not brave in deeds, little friends! Do you want to be someone who is brave in deeds but reluctant to speak, or do you want to be someone who is brave in speaking but reluctant to do things?</p>
<h3>Children's Jokes</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Thickest Skin</p>
<p>Brother: Do you know which part of the human body has the thickest skin?</p>
<p>Younger Brother: I think it's probably the face.</p>
<p>Brother: Why do you say that?</p>
<p>Younger Brother: Look at this cold weather, everyone is wearing cotton clothes, leather clothes, gloves, and cotton shoes, but only the face is not covered at all. Isn't that because the skin on the face is the thickest?</p>
<p>Clear at a Glance</p>
<p>Older Sister: Little sister, why do you always close one eye when you read?</p>
<p>Younger Sister: Because I heard people say: (clear at a glance), if you open both eyes, you can't see clearly.</p>
<p>Don't Tell Him</p>
<p>Passerby: Which of you two is the older brother? Which is the younger brother?</p>
<p>Ling'er: Brother: Don't tell him.</p>
<h3>Small Experiences</h3>
<p>— Jian Fen</p>
<p>Book Covering Paper</p>
<p>Little friends: The (books) you read are often placed on the desk, and the (covers) are easily dirtied, aren't they? The (cover) is like our own lovely (face). If our (face) is dirty, it would be unsightly, wouldn't it? So when you receive your (new books) at the beginning of the school year, quickly cover them with (book covering paper). This way, the ink stains and filth on the desk and hands won't easily get on the (cover). Because there is a layer of (book covering paper) outside the (cover). When you are on vacation and have finished reading the (books), and you are about to put the (books) away, take off the (book covering paper): Little friends, isn't the (cover) of this (book) still very new then?</p>
<h3>Curling Book Corners</h3>
<p>Little friends: Do the (corners) of your lovely (books) often curl up? If this happens, to avoid the (book corners curling) up, take active measures: | Before the (book corner) curls | When reading (books), don't lean your hands on the (book) and don't flip it over frequently. After reading, put the (book) in a (book clip). Take passive measures: | After the (book corner) has curled | First, straighten the curled (book corner) to its original shape, clip it in a (book clip), and press it flat with a heavy object. Second, correct the bad habit of (book corners curling).</p>
<h3>Cold Shrinks, Heat Expands</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yuan</p>
<p>Zhang'er heard the teacher say that all objects expand when heated and shrink when cooled. He also saw the teacher's experiment, using a small copper ball with a chain attached, placed on a small copper frame. The ball could move up and down through the hole in the frame. Later, the ball was heated over an alcohol lamp for some time and then placed on the frame, and the ball was held firmly. The teacher said: "This is because heat expands the object. The area of the ball has expanded after being heated by burning, so it can be held." After twenty minutes, the ball fell down again. The teacher said: "(This is because cold shrinks the object. Although the ball expands when heated, it shrinks back to its original shape after the heat dissipates, so it falls down again.)" Zhang'er understood the concept of thermal expansion and contraction very well.</p>
<p>One day, during a very cold winter, his tea glass broke because the tea inside froze overnight and filled the glass. His father said: "(When water freezes, its volume increases, so the glass broke. It's because you didn't pour out the tea inside last night)." Zhang'er said, "(Heat expands, isn't this an exception? Doesn't cold expand?)"</p>
<p>While eating, Zhang'er saw someone pick up a large piece of fish soup jelly with chopsticks and put it in the hot pot. After a moment, he looked around in the hot pot and said, "(Who ate my fish jelly that was being heated?)" His father said: "(Silly child, doesn't fish jelly turn into soup when heated? How could it still be there?)" Zhang'er said: "Who knew there was an exception where heat shrinks, and it shrunk to the point of disappearing!"</p>
<h3>Chemical Games</h3>
<p>— De Ling</p>
<p>Igniting with a Glass Rod</p>
<p>Jinghui said to Xuemei: "The school's fun fair is coming up soon! What kind of performance shall we prepare?" Xuemei thought for a moment and said: "I have an empty water bottle and a large copper coin here. I'll also ask my mother for some yarn and pour some alcohol into the bottle to make a homemade alcohol lamp. Please go to Mr. Qian and borrow a glass rod and ask for some lithium salt and concentrated sulfuric acid." After a while, Jinghui and Xuemei got everything they needed. Then Xuemei dipped the glass rod in some sulfuric acid, then in some lithium salt, and then touched the end of the glass rod to the alcohol lamp wick, and the alcohol lamp lit. Jinghui laughed: "Great! Let's do this experiment!"</p>
<p>Making Fire with Water</p>
<p>Zhaolin was a student with excellent character and learning. On the day of her graduation ceremony, she went to the chemistry lab and asked the nature teacher for a small piece of sodium, which she preserved well in kerosene. She also prepared a small basin, a glass tube, some very dry lecture papers, and a glass of hot water. After the ceremony, during the entertainment, she tore the paper into pieces in front of everyone, poured kerosene on the paper, hid the sodium under the paper, and placed it in the small basin. Then she used the glass tube to suck up some hot water and dropped it on the sodium. The sodium and water combined to form sodium hydroxide and released a high amount of heat, causing the sodium to burn, and thus the paper also burned. Everyone who watched was baffled.</p>
<p>Self-Igniting Fire</p>
<p>Wenshu took an empty ink bottle, poured some carbon disulfide into it, and cut some yellow phosphorus in water and put it into the carbon disulfide. The yellow phosphorus gradually dissolved, forming a solution of carbon disulfide and yellow phosphorus. One day, after the semester exams were over, when the class held a farewell party, Wenshu poured some of this solution onto paper and placed it on an iron tripod. In a short while, the paper started to emit white smoke, and then boom! The paper burned. The classmates were very surprised and didn't know what chemicals Wenshu used, they just clapped their hands non-stop.</p>
<p>Chemical Fire-Making</p>
<p>Shuming read about the method of making fire using chemicals, invented three hundred years ago, in the first volume of the Children's Science Series, in the chapter on matches. So she bought some white sugar and also found some lithium oxate and sulfuric acid. First, she carefully mixed equal amounts of sugar and potassium oxate. Then she took some and placed it on a wire mesh on an iron frame or on bricks. She used a glass rod to drip some sulfuric acid on the mixture, and immediately a bright flame burst out and burned. Shuming was very happy, but she didn't know that sugar is a carbohydrate, potassium oxalate contains a lot of oxygen, and sulfuric acid can absorb the water in the sugar and make it heat up, thus causing it to burn.</p>
<p>Making Fire on Ice</p>
<p>Lu Zhen's father was an old scholar from the Qing Dynasty who liked to smoke a water pipe. The north wind of the previous New Year had already blown the Siberian cold current to the Southern country. The water outside had hardened and formed crystal-like ice blocks. Lu Zhen hoped that his father would understand the progress of science, believe in the omnipotence of science, and to make his father happy, he secretly wrapped two small potassium sticks in the head of the water pipe and knocked a piece of ice from outside. With a naive smile and a round face, he said to his father, "Dad! I'm making fire on ice for you to smoke the water pipe!" As he spoke, he touched the potassium stick on the pipe head to the surface of the ice. Because the potassium reacted with the water, it produced fire, and the pipe head was lit.</p>

<p>Telegraph Special Issue</p>
<p>Voice of the Telegraph World</p>
<h3>Telegraphs and Roads (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Notes for Telegraph Senders and Receivers</p>
<p>The transmission of telegrams has no relation to roads. However, the title of this article is "Telegraphs and Roads," so readers may suspect that telegraphs are involved in road construction or are used in conjunction with highways, air routes, railways, or automobiles. This is not the case. The route that telegrams travel can be called a "circuit," whether it is wired or wireless. When the circuit is open, the telegram can reach its destination. The "circuit" of a circuit and the "road" of a road are the same "road," but in reality, they cannot be confused.</p>
<p>If we place ourselves in the middle of a busy avenue and see vehicles coming and going, one after another, and also see police officers directing traffic and traffic lights indicating directions, each heading to their desired destination in an orderly manner without any confusion, we can reflect on this and infer that telegraphic communication is no different from road communication. Understanding the conditions of roads and using them to infer about telegraphs is more than halfway to understanding. Therefore, "Telegraphs and Roads" does not mean that telegraphs rely on roads. In fact, the sending, receiving, and traveling of telegrams can be compared to the conditions of roads. Telegraphs or roads? I can confidently say that by observing roads, you can understand telegraphs.</p>
<p>For telegraph senders and receivers, to understand the actual situation of telegraph transmission, one should first know the direct line that the telegram travels. The so-called direct line refers to the ability to send directly from one place to another, without bothering intermediate stations for retransmission. For example, Shanghai is directly connected to Nanjing, Tianjin, Hankou, and Fuzhou, and the message arrives as soon as it is sent. Therefore, even if the distance between Shanghai and the above-mentioned places seems quite far on the map, the time it takes for each telegram to reach the receiver from the sender is only a few minutes. This situation is analogous to a private car carrying passengers directly from one place to another without stopping along the way.</p>
<p>Based on our experience of traveling by car, the Beijing-Shanghai train first arrives at Wuxi and then reaches Nanjing. By analogy, it seems that telegrams sent to Wuxi should arrive faster than those sent to Nanjing. However, this idea is not entirely accurate, because telegraph transmission is divided into direct and non-direct routes. Therefore, telegrams from Shanghai to Wuxi usually take the route from Shanghai to Zhenjiang to Wuxi, with the Zhenjiang station handling the transfer. As a result, it cannot be as fast as telegrams from Shanghai to Zhenjiang or Beijing to Shanghai. This is like taking a car to a place that does not have a direct stop, and you often have to get off near the destination and make a detour. Observing how the road stops are divided is no different from the regulations of circuits. (Someone may wonder, why can't circuits be opened for direct access everywhere? This belongs to a business problem. Direct routes are beneficial for busy operations. If the operations are light, direct lines are permanently occupied, which is not economical.)</p>
<h3>Benefits of the Account-Based Telegram Guarantee Method</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Implemented from March 1st</p>
<p>Previously, in order to facilitate telegram sending for various businesses, telegraph offices and radio stations allowed them to deposit an approximate amount of monthly telegram fees in advance. At the end of the month, the accounts were settled, and any overpayment was refunded, and any underpayment was made up. This was called "pre-depositing telegram fees." However, this method was managed independently by each office and station, and there was no regulation. The deposited funds and interest were not reported to the Ministry of Communications, so the Ministry could not audit them. The interest on the deposited funds was not given to the businesses, causing them to suffer losses. In some cases, the funds deposited last year had not yet been settled this year, or the funds collected by the previous director of the office or station had been taken away, and the current director denied them because there was no case to audit. This has been a long-standing practice, and both businesses and offices/stations have suffered from it. Now, the electrical administration authorities have recognized this problem and have formulated eleven articles of the Account-Based Telegram Guarantee Method, which have been ordered to be implemented by all offices and stations from March 1st. The main points of the articles and the benefits for both parties are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the business side:</p>
<p>1.  The purpose of a business sending telegrams is to have the telegrams transmitted quickly to their destination, which benefits their business. However, to achieve this goal, there must be a premise, that is, the telegram receiving procedure must be very simple. Therefore, the principle of pre-depositing telegram fees is indeed adoptable. Now, to be cautious about telegram fees, it is stipulated that any business that applies to send account-based telegrams should deposit the approximate amount of monthly telegram fees in cash with the office/station's bank as a telegram fee guarantee. The amount of the guarantee is fixed and does not change. Account-based telegram fees are paid monthly and are not deducted from the guarantee to avoid the trouble of rolling calculations. Thus, businesses not only have the convenience of sending account-based telegrams but also have the right to verify their deposited funds. This is the fundamental difference between the Account-Based Telegram Guarantee Method and pre-depositing telegram fees. This is the first benefit.</p>
<p>2.  According to the provisions of Article 3 of the method: "(The guarantee is deposited in the bank, and the office/station may not withdraw it unless one of the following situations occurs: (a) The business fails to pay the telegram fees due, and the office/station withdraws the telegram fees; (b) The business stops sending telegrams, and the office/station withdraws the funds for payment; (c) The business reduces the number of telegrams sent, and the office/station withdraws the funds to return part of the guarantee." With such clear regulations, it is impossible for unscrupulous handlers to touch this money. Thus, businesses do not have to worry about the unauthorized withdrawal of the guarantee, and the office/station does not have to worry about the lack of telegram fees. There is mutual guarantee and mutual trust, which is the second benefit.</p>
<p>3.  The interest on the guarantee is calculated by the bank every six months, and the office/station allocates it to the business that deposited the funds. Thus, the interest on the business's deposited funds will definitely not be lost. This is the third benefit.</p>
<p>4.  Article 8 of the method states: "(If the business reduces the number of telegrams sent, it may request the office/station to return part of the guarantee.)" Thus, although the guarantee is deposited in the bank, if the business does not need to send many telegrams, it can still request the return of part of the guarantee. This is not like the previous pre-deposited telegram fees, even if they are withdrawn. This is the fourth benefit.</p>
<p>5.  Article 9 of the method has the provision that "(the guarantee may be replaced by a guarantee letter from a bank designated by the office/station)," which is even more convenient. Most of the telegram senders in various places are financial institutions, or they have a considerable relationship with financial institutions. Now that the guarantee can be replaced by a guarantee letter from a bank designated by the office/station, the business only needs to obtain a letter from the bank to obtain the qualification to send account-based telegrams. Why not do it?</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the office/station side:</p>
<p>1.  Simple telegram receiving procedures: When telegrams are sent to the receiving and sending department of the office/station, the receiving staff must calculate the number of words, calculate the telegram fee, issue a receipt, and find the change, etc. This procedure takes at least three minutes. If there are ten senders arriving at the office at the same time, the last telegram will be delayed by thirty minutes. If the account-based telegram method is adopted, the receiving staff only needs to sign in the telegram sending book, which is enough. The remaining procedures can be done after the telegram is transmitted. Then the speed of the telegram must be greatly increased.</p>
<p>2.  Telegram fees will not be empty: After the guarantee is deposited in the bank, the office/station may not withdraw it unless one of the three situations mentioned above (a, b, and c) exists. Thus, even if the supervisor wants to use the money temporarily, it is impossible. Therefore, the act of filling one's own pocket with the deposited funds is impossible in fact. The procedures for settling telegram fees and deducting the guarantee, and the recovery of telegram fees exceeding the guarantee, are separately and strictly regulated by Articles 6 and 7 of the method. Therefore, there is no worry that telegram fees will be empty.</p>
<p>The purpose of depositing money to send telegrams is to facilitate businesses and the public. If there is no definite method, greedy people will regard it as a source of profit, which will not only damage the reputation of the office/station but also harm business and seek private gain, which violates the prohibited laws. Now, the electrical administration authorities have stipulated an Account-Based Telegram Guarantee Method, which sweeps away the long-standing bad habits of the past. This is indeed a gratifying move. If various businesses go to the office/station to try it out, they will know that I am not deceiving them.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Bypath Automatic Telephone</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Installed in the Advances Telephone Exchange</p>
<p>The Advances Telephone Exchange in the United Kingdom opened on February 23, 1933. The opening ceremony was performed by the former Postmaster General, Mr. Etherly. This is the first time in the world of telephones that the Bypath automatic telephone was used. All the components, except for the electrical part, were made by Stsndard Telephones and Cables Ltd. This type of machine was developed by an engineer who participated in the European War as part of the Royal Communications Corps. He continued to study it at the company's Hendon Testing Center for seven years before the exchange was installed. This automatic telephone was purely at the request of the company, and the Post Office was not under any obligation. However, for trial purposes, it was allowed to be installed two years ago. In the four months before the opening, it was tested in detail by engineers from the Post Office. The exchange currently has a capacity of 3,400 subscribers and can be expanded to 10,000 in the future. The selector used is only a horizontal rotary type, which is simple and saves costs. According to the business manager of the company, who told the press, this type of machine is 20% cheaper than the Strowger System machine, occupies 30% less area, weighs 40% less, saves 10% on electricity, saves 29% on the connecting wires between the various levels of selectors, and can also reduce maintenance costs. Judging from the various advantages, it is believed that many people will adopt it in the future. This type is not only suitable for use in large cities, but also for small rural exchanges that are unmanned. The advantages and equipment are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Advantages of the Bypath system</p>
<p>The advantage of the Bypath automatic telephone is that it occupies very few components when two subscribers are talking. In other automatic telephones, expensive and complex selectors are usually used to select the number. And from the time the number is selected until the call is completed, it is always occupied, and other users cannot use it. The attached relays and parts, even if one part of them is only used to select the number and is not needed during the call, must also be occupied. However, this type is different. All number selection work is done step by step by another part of the Bypath selector. Once selected, the wire is immediately removed for use by other subscribers. Therefore, the parts that are occupied but not used during the call can be reduced. The circuit of each level of selector can be simple. Some only have one relay. The number of machine components is therefore reduced. Each set of Bypath selectors is composed of several horizontal rotary selectors and several relays. The number of Bypath selectors required for the entire exchange is not large. Each set of Bypath selectors can be used for ten subscribers to call. The attached diagram shows the operation of the various levels of components when calling a five-digit number. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Four Hundred Thousand</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>The telegraph has implemented a price reduction. Names and addresses with fifteen characters are counted as five characters for billing. According to people in the telegraph industry, the Ministry of Communications created this new method. If the telegraph service is still the same as before, comparing income, the annual loss is about 400,000 yuan. This 400,000 yuan, which the Ministry loses, is naturally the benefit of the senders.</p>
<p>Let's think further. For example, after the telegram business reduces prices, it develops accordingly. The number of increased revenue is enough to offset the 400,000 yuan. Then, for the 400,000 yuan in revenue, all the telegraph offices and stations in the country, still following the practice of reducing fees for names and addresses, and not counting the report header, must receive at least about six million more words of telegrams than in previous years. How much electricity is consumed? How much material (including paper strips, ink, receiving and forwarding paper, etc.) is consumed? Although the reporter does not have time to make precise statistics, the number should be quite a bit.</p>
<p>Thinking about the work involved, increasing the number of words received and sent by six million means that two million four hundred thousand more telegraph codes need to be transmitted and copied, assuming each word is four codes. Also, if each code averages three dots and dashes, then the duty officers increase the number of dots and dashes of telegraph symbols transmitted to a total of seventy-two million! Although this is for the whole country, the number of words in the report header and the number of characters at the intermediate stations have not been counted, so in reality, it is definitely more than this.</p>
<p>Please try to imagine this, social figures, don't underestimate this telegram price reduction!</p>
<h3>How to Use Social Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>Telegrams are very common communication tools, like express mail in the eyes of foreigners, and they are not considered particularly rare. However, in our country, where people's intelligence has not yet developed, the average person thinks telegrams are almost ominous things because they use them so rarely. Because receiving a telegram is not reporting the serious illness or bad news of family members or friends, but other troubles have occurred. You won't receive a telegram for something good. Under these circumstances, it is natural that the telegraph business cannot be fully developed!</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Communications has seen this weakness, so it added a kind of social telegram to give the general public the opportunity to try to use telegrams. For just a few cents of telegram fee, you can send a telegram to relatives and friends, and the telegram text is not necessarily reporting ominous things, such as congratulating on a wedding, birthday, birth of a child, etc., making the telegram a lucky thing. Gradually create a trend in the minds of the public, only knowing that telegrams are the fastest communication tool. If there is an important matter, such as mail that can't make it in time, use a telegram. If relatives and friends have weddings or funerals, send a social telegram to congratulate or offer condolences, saving yourself the time of writing a long letter to congratulate or offer condolences, and also saving the recipient the time of reading the letter. And telegrams are always more valuable than mail, so the recipient will pay special attention to the telegram. If you want to express special feelings to relatives and friends, or, to be frank, if you want to please the other party, then you must use telegrams. Now, I will talk about how to use social telegrams, hoping that everyone is happy to use them and get the benefit of (spending a small fee and receiving great results).</p>
<p>(1) When the following kinds of things happen, you should use social telegrams to congratulate relatives and friends and express your good feelings: (1) Relatives and friends get married (2) Relatives and friends' birthdays (3) Relatives and friends give birth to children or grandchildren (4) Relatives and friends are promoted (5) Relatives and friends graduate or receive degrees (6) Relatives and friends' businesses are profitable or awarded prizes (7) Relatives and friends go abroad or return home (8) Colleagues open (9) Military victory over the enemy (10) Relatives and friends invent new things (11) Ceremonies such as highway opening, ship launching, airplane naming, and house completion (12) Christmas and New Year (13) Relatives and friends are elected to important positions (14) Athletes win or set new records (15) Other things that can be congratulated.</p>
<p>(2) When the following kinds of things happen, you should immediately send social telegrams to offer condolences to relatives and friends and express your sympathy: (1) Relatives and friends themselves or their family members get sick (2) Relatives and friends themselves or their family members die (3) Relatives and friends themselves or their family members temporarily encounter accidents, such as theft, kidnapping, fire, injury, being falsely accused or arrested, etc. (4) Funerals or anniversary of the deaths of relatives and friends' family members (5) Group strikes or dissolutions (6) Earthquake or other natural disasters (7) Places are ravaged by enemies or bandits (8) Relatives and friends' businesses are unsuccessful (9) Relatives and friends fail to get elected (10) Other things that should be consoled or condoled.</p>
<p>(3) When you receive a social telegram of congratulations or condolences from relatives and friends, you should immediately send a return telegram to express your gratitude. This return telegram is also considered a social telegram.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned method of using social telegrams is not simply for me to promote the telegraph office and attract business, but to advocate for the public to use telegrams to socialize with relatives and friends. If you socialize well in peacetime, your relatives and friends will be happy to help you, and it will be easy to succeed in whatever you want to do. So I dare say that using social telegrams is like sowing the seeds of success. To go a step further, social telegrams are success telegrams. Anyone who has always had a broad social circle must send social telegrams! People who don't send social telegrams cannot be considered to have a broad social circle! At the same time, people who have weddings or funerals must receive dozens or hundreds of social telegrams on the day of the event, which is considered a broad social circle and a full face!</p>
<p>One more thing, when relatives and friends whose friendship is not very deep send wedding invitations or obituaries, giving a gift that is too heavy seems unworthy, and a gift that is too light will not satisfy the recipient very much. If you switch to using social telegrams, it can make the recipient feel happy, and in fact, the cost is simpler. It is really (killing two birds with one stone!)</p>
<p>In addition, I hope that the telegraph office can deliver social telegrams at the time specified by the sender. For example, if the recipient is getting married at 4:00 p.m. on a certain afternoon, the sender can request that it be delivered at 4:00 p.m. on that afternoon, so that the recipient feels particularly gratified. Because delivering it too early or too late loses the timeliness of the telegram. This designated time can be written after the telegram text and signature, such as (1600), representing 4:00 p.m., which is counted as one character. If the distance is far, you can add a date, represented by a rhyme or code, also counted as one character.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Wireless Telephone Technology in Various Countries (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wang Dachun</p>
<p>The advance of Ultra Short Wave or MicroRay wireless telephones into practical use has been the greatest success in the transportation sector in recent years. It uses extremely short radio waves to transmit to distant locations without attenuation, echo, distortion, or other drawbacks. Furthermore, due to the shorter wavelengths, it can maintain communication secrecy, making it invaluable for military and other transportation purposes. This type of ultra-shortwave wireless telephone was first demonstrated between Dover in England and Calais in France on March 31, 1931. Now, it is in practical use and has reached a very perfected state. This demonstration used a two-way system with a wavelength of 18 centimeters (18c.m.) and an antenna of only two centimeters. During the demonstration, each location had over thirty listeners who used this telephone to communicate across the Strait of Dover. The results showed that such wavelengths do not attenuate as easily as ordinary radio waves and are less susceptible to absorption by rain or fog. Another advantage is that in ordinary wireless telephone transmitters, the wavelengths of each transmitter must be uniform. However, with ultra-shortwave telephones, the wavelength of each of the ten thousand transmitters can be different, yet effective transmission can still be achieved, accounting for about a quarter of the total.</p>
<p>Between 1930 and 1931, the British International Telegraph and Telephone Experimental Institute, in conjunction with the French Telephone Materials Experimental Institute, publicly tested a single sideband system for radio telephones used on short waves. The results clearly demonstrated that this type of wireless telephone had evolved to a commercially viable stage for shortwave communication. On May 21, 1931, in Madrid, the capital of Spain, and Trappes near Paris, this wireless telephone was publicly demonstrated. At that time, about seventy listeners listened to both sides communicating in English and French, and a special signal was demonstrated for about an hour, with excellent results. As for the spread sideband system applied to shortwave wireless telephones, there has also been progress, to the extent that it can completely eliminate or reduce the distortion caused by radio wave attenuation.</p>
<p>Mobile transportation tools, such as giant ships sailing in the ocean, are now equipped with wireless telephones, allowing passengers on board to have direct conversations with any telephone user in major cities in Europe and America. The wireless telephone of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company's mail ship (Empress of Britain) was installed early and could directly communicate with landline telephones. Telephone services in various parts of the United States have been connected to the wireless telephones of Furness Company's mail ship (Monarch of Bermuda) and (S.S Belgenland). When these ships were operating on world routes, there were several high-record transoceanic calls: First, the great scientist Albert Einstein and other celebrities used this telephone to broadcast nationwide from the pier in New York. The second was from the Pacific coast of Central America, with significant results. Other wireless telephone connections include direct lines from our country's territorial waters to the United States, Bombay to London, the Red Sea to the United States, and Alexandria in Egypt to Washington, D.C., all of which have recently opened.

<p>Revisions to the Telegraph Registered Address Regulations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications recently revised the current telegraph registered address regulations because they were established by the old Ministry of Communications and have been in use for nearly a decade, making them unsuitable for the current situation. The new regulations took effect on April 1 of this year. The important points of the new regulations are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Telegraph registered addresses only need to be registered at one telegraph office or radio station and can be used at both. (For example, Shanghai has six locations, including the telegraph office, domestic radio station, international radio station, and Sanshui line receiving and dispatching office. Registration only needs to be done at the joint registration office located in the telegraph office, and it will be valid at all locations.)</p>
<p>(2) Chinese and foreign registered addresses can be used interchangeably. (Under the old regulations, Chinese telegraphs were not allowed to use foreign registered addresses.)</p>
<p>(3) There are three types of registration: 1. Three years for 25 yuan; 2. One year for 10 yuan; 3. One month for 1 yuan. The effective period for three-year and one-year registrations is calculated from January 1 to the end of the year for registrations made in the first half of the year, and from July 1 to June 30 of the fourth or second year for registrations made in the second half of the year. One-month registrations are calculated uniformly from the first day of the month of registration to the end of the month. This registration can be applied for several months at a time. (Registrations that are about to expire can be re-registered according to the new regulations after the expiration date.)</p>
<p>The above two points are extremely beneficial to the public sending telegrams. The third point, the registration fee is calculated on a monthly or yearly basis, which seems slightly disadvantageous, but those who register for a long-term of three years can save as much as five yuan. All long-term businesses can benefit from this. Also, those who wish to register for a long-term registration in March-April or August-September can first register for a short-term for several months and then register for a long-term at the end of June or the end of the year to reduce the loss.</p>
<p>Telegraph Bureau to Notify Recipients of Prepaid Reply Telegrams</p>
<p>For the convenience of senders and receivers, the Telegraph Bureau has a method for senders to prepay the reply telegram fee so that the recipient can reply immediately after receiving the telegram without having to pay. However, many of our people are still not very clear about this method, so very few people use it. Even those who use it often have recipients who do not understand the situation and delay replying, causing the sender to wait anxiously, thinking that the Telegraph Bureau has delayed the telegram or failed to notify the recipient, causing a lot of misunderstandings. In order to be thorough, the Ministry of Communications has specially instructed all bureaus and stations to add a stamp on the bottom of the telegram for such telegrams: "This telegram has been prepaid for the reply telegram fee by the sender. Please bring the attached reply telegram voucher to the bureau to send the reply telegram." This is to make the recipient pay attention. If the telegram is not replied within three days after delivery, the bureau or station will send a letter to inquire again to avoid forgetting.</p>
<p>Long-Distance Telephone Bureaus and Offices Sell Telephone Directories</p>
<p>If local telephone subscribers in areas with long-distance telephone service need telephone directories from telephone bureaus or commercial telephone companies in other places, they can request the local telephone bureau or commercial telephone company to purchase them on their behalf. The Ministry of Communications has recently notified all telephone bureaus and commercial telephone companies to follow this method.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Cooperation Between the Telecommunications and Press Circles</h3>
<p>— Ye Zhonghua</p>
<p>The level of a nation's culture is often judged by the development of its press.</p>
<p>And to assist the development of the press, telecommunications have a deep relationship. After all, the transmission of news cannot be done without relying on telecommunications as a powerful tool. All trends in the politics and economy of the world, as well as changes in natural disasters and human affairs, rely on telecommunications to transmit and present to our eyes in an instant. To run a newspaper without the records of telecommunications is to depreciate its own value; and for telecommunications not to be able to provide the use of news transmission is to fail to fulfill its duty to serve society. Therefore, the telecommunications industries of all countries in the world, whether state-run or not, do their best to cooperate and assist the press in various ways, because newspapers are the voice of the people and the guide of public opinion. Assisting the press is to maintain culture.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of telegraphs in our country, the transmission of news has followed the precedents of various countries around the world, giving the press various conveniences. Such as reducing the price of news telegrams and implementing the recipient-pays system, all of which are special rights enjoyed by the press. In recent years, although personnel salaries have increased and the price of machine parts and materials has risen, and the expenses of telecommunications administration have increased year by year. However, the transportation authorities, in these difficult circumstances, still try to reduce the burden on the press. For example, since January 1 of this year, all urgent news telegrams have been charged as ordinary telegrams, which is one example.</p>
<p>In recent years, the press in our country has become increasingly prosperous. Morning and evening newspapers are published day and night. The demand for news is strong, and the sending of news telegrams has become more frequent. Telegraph bureau staff pay great attention to the transmission of news telegrams. Generally, they must be completed before the newspaper is printed, so that the telegrams of the day can be published. This spirit of service is indeed the duty of the telegraph bureau. It is also that telegraphs and news are working together for culture, and since they have a common mission, they are willing to cooperate to the end.</p>
<p>The telegraph bureau's cooperation with the press is as mentioned above. However, there is one thing that is most unpleasant for the press, and that is news censorship. The government's purpose in setting up censorship is nothing more than to prevent the conspiracy of those who fabricate rumors and stir up trouble, and it is not a harsh treatment for the press. However, the telegraph bureau knows the pain of the press, so it strives to simplify and speed up the procedures for checking telegrams, so that news telegrams are not delayed by censorship. This fact should be well known to the press and understood by the press.</p>
<p>Finally, what we hope from the press is: in recent years, the telegraph business has been determined to reform, especially to reduce the price of telegrams, so as to meet the needs of society, such as the creation of low-cost social telegrams, the revision of the method of calculating the number of words in the recipient's name and address, and the reduction of the price of urgent telegrams, free inquiries of official telegrams, etc., all of which are to reduce the burden on senders and receivers. The Ministry of Communications has therefore reduced its revenue by about 500,000 yuan per year. This extraordinary reform is to enable society to fully use telegrams as a communication tool, so that the telegraph bureau can obtain more service opportunities. However, the implementation of this price reduction method cannot attract the attention of society without extensive publicity. Therefore, the most important task at present is how to awaken the public to develop the habit of sending telegrams, which depends on the cooperation and guidance of the press.</p>

<p>Women's Garden</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The wheel of time advances, awakening a group of people who have become numb from hardship. Women are one part of this group. Women all over the world, under immense pressure, are desperately crying out. This has become a historical fact since the late 19th century, and some have already obtained a bright future.</p>
<p>In our country, since the May Fourth Movement, the women's movement has also become an epoch-making page in history. At that time, the number of publications on women's issues was as numerous as bamboo shoots after rain, but they were only fleeting, and soon gradually declined. Is it that Chinese women have already obtained a bright future and do not need to cry out anymore? Unawakened women will certainly stare blankly and not know how to answer, but awakened women will respond sadly and say: (No).</p>
<p>Now, a small number of women have been liberated from the family to the school, and from the school to society. However, the facts they have shown are: most of them have been swept into the path of modernity by the raging waves of the times, participating in what (fashion shows), arranging beautiful new families, only knowing to catch up with Western civilization, thus becoming good customers of imperialist commodities: not only becoming slaves to sell foreign goods, but also becoming modern playthings. Another part of intellectual women are obsessed with the supremacy of love and the supremacy of art, dreaming (love) and (beauty) dreams. As for rural women, they still live a life of hardship like cattle and horses. The female workers in factories in the cities are spending a life of ignorant and laborious life. We have now opened up this small garden, hoping that our compatriots will work together to irrigate it, work hard to cultivate it, and write about what you want to advocate, and tell about all your suffering. We also accept all the well-intentioned instructions of our male compatriots. We hope to live together and operate together on this rugged path of life.</p>
<h3>Hurry Up and Open Up the Women's Garden!</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>Where is the women's garden? Looking all over the country, most women are subordinate. Women used to have no place to stand, because of this, they bound their small feet like awls; now, although it is said that they have been liberated, they only have a pair of empty seven-inch unbound feet.</p>
<p>Women are already extremely docile sheep, and women are already the most dilapidated and foolish creatures. For the sake of food, clothing, and housing, they sell their flesh piecemeal (prostitutes) or wholesale (marry); for the sake of having no chance to learn, or having some knowledge but not daring to act directly because they are not their own masters, they sell their souls; finally, they use hands without souls to deal with the current world or nurture future lives, and sell their race.</p>
<p>In the old society, although women did not have an independent garden, they were still attached to men, cooking and managing the home, raising silkworms and picking tea, helping with hard work. But in the new society, modern women have revolutionized these works: the canon they worship is wearing, eating, and carefree. Thus, they have become bees and butterflies in the men's garden, and to put it more badly, they have become foxes. In a dilapidated society like China, how much energy can men have to cultivate? Moreover, adding to the disturbance of these bees and butterflies, and the gnawing of the foxes?</p>
<p>It is not that women absolutely have no garden, just as it is not that China has no vast land; however, half has already been exploited by others, and half is being abandoned by themselves.</p>
<p>What is most heartbreaking is the self-abandonment of women in the new era. For the sake of enjoyment, comfort, and parasitism, they are willing to watch the country sink deeper and deeper, and men are increasingly oppressed by two kinds of people, while they retreat to the inhuman status of bees, butterflies, and foxes.</p>
<p>We never talk about the big problems of the world and humanity. In the current country, the women's garden that needs to be opened up urgently has at least these works: saving the flesh of commodities, making them independent and self-respecting; saving the dim souls, making them smart and clean; saving the dying race, making them great and long-lasting.</p>
<p>Our garden, which has been exploited by others, undoubtedly needs to be taken back quickly; as for those that have been abandoned by ourselves, it is too lacking in (human) flavor not to work hard to take them back. We must always shout loudly: (Hurry up and open up the women's garden)!</p>
<h3>Whose (Women's Garden)?</h3>
<p>— Minzhi</p>
<p>Because China has produced too many Ah Qs, the position of women in society is simply regarded as something unnecessary. Originally, the scholars and officials of ancient China regarded women as dangerous goods: and the Chinese Ah Qs all took it upon themselves to be (saints) and (omnipotent doctors), so the position of women in society was especially completely denied. On the stage of all Chinese historical dramas, palace maids, queens, and Lin Daiyu disguised as old actors can be (performed,) which shows that in the eyes of the country where Ah Qs are rampant, women have been regarded as something that can be disguised, because Ah Qs are all omnipotent doctors, and Ah Qs all have the skills of women.</p>
<p>Therefore, when talking about opening up (women's garden,) today, how can one not be filled with emotion?</p>
<p>The wife layer, Miss layer, and what (flower) and (queen) layer of Chinese women are all in the business of X.</p>
<p>(Women's garden) is naturally (men are not allowed in,) and among women, it seems that not everyone can come in. It is hoped that this place will exclude the mood of the wife-like (bored and unhappy going to the park to relax) and entertain, for women who produce for society and can fight for real life to participate in this amateur park.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this place will strictly abandon articles discussing how to please men in order to win men's favors. On the contrary, it should provide historical materials of working women in actual life, and discuss how to obtain social equality and re-evaluate the contribution of women to society.</p>
<h3>Ellen Key and Alexandra Kollontai</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Ellen Key and Alexandra Kollontai are pioneers in the women's world, and both have unique insights into the issue of women's liberation. Below is a record of the conversation about them.</p>
<p>Zi Wen: Today, the topic we are preparing to discuss is: (Ellen Key and Alexandra Kollontai).</p>
<p>Ying Ying: Isn't Alexandra Kollontai the Soviet female writer who wrote (Three Generations of Love) and (Red Bird, etc.)?</p>
<p>Zi Wen: She is not only a writer, but also a diplomat. She has served as the ambassador to Norway and the ambassador to Mexico.</p>
<p>Fei Pei: The words and deeds of these two women in the world are indeed worthy of our study. It's just that I don't understand the life and deeds of these two people. Now I will raise what I don't understand and ask you to teach me: In which country was Ellen Key born?</p>
<p>Zi Wen: She was born in 1849 in a small city in southern Sweden. Her father once served as a cabinet member. Her mother was also highly educated and very enthusiastic about women's liberation, so Ellen Key's later promotion of the women's liberation movement was not without reason.</p>
<p>Fei Pei: What is Ellen Key's outlook on life?</p>
<p>Zi Wen: She is a spiritual optimist. She believes that since she is born in this world, her mind and body should be very healthy, very happy, and live powerfully. She said: (Our life should be full of humility, a broad mind, a deep understanding of all things like a great poet, and always be as innocent, happy and lively as a child.) From these words, we can imagine how bright, humble, broad and generous her outlook on life is.</p>
<p>Ying Ying: Looking at it this way, Ellen Key is just a person who compromises with reality.</p>
<p>Zi Wen: That can't be said either. If she was a realistic compromiser, how could she have shouted the call for (liberating women) in that era? However, she uses (love) to reconcile life, neither blaming the sky nor hating people, and at the same time is definitely not a realistic compromiser but a rebel. She is also not like ordinary women who are dissatisfied with real life, but still sink into real life and cannot extricate themselves.</p>
<p>Fei Pei: What are the goals of Ellen Key's women's movement?</p>
<p>Zi Wen: She put forward three creeds. 1. Marriage should be based on love. 2. Free divorce. 3. Maternal revival.</p>
<p>Ying Ying: I remember that Ellen Key's advocacy of love marriage is based on eugenics. Is that right?</p>
<p>Zi Wen: Yes. She once said: (Love is sacred and is the source of all culture. The two sides of love marriage must feel supreme happiness, and the children born under such a life must be smarter than the children born to ordinary couples without love. However, Ellen Key's view is indeed lacking scientific basis. She only said that most of the so-called great men, great artists, and great thinkers in history are illegitimate children, in other words, their parents are mostly combined by love. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Struggle for Women's Suffrage in the World</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Since the late 19th century, women in various countries around the world have wanted to have equal status with men in politics. Therefore, women in various countries mostly regard obtaining suffrage as the prerequisite for the liberation movement. The countries that have successively obtained suffrage are listed below:</p>
<p>Australia 1893 Finland 1906</p>
<p>Norway 1915 Denmark 1915</p>
<p>Netherlands 1917 Soviet Union 1917</p>
<p>United Kingdom 1918 Germany 1919</p>
<p>Hungary 1919</p>
<p>South America 1919 United States 1920</p>
<p>Poland 1921 Sweden 1921</p>
<p>Canada 1921 Greece 1930</p>
<p>Spain 1931</p>
<p>As for women in France, Japan, Italy, Switzerland, Romania, and other countries, although they already have a considerable status in society, and they are also constantly campaigning for the acquisition of political power, they have not been allowed by the rulers.</p>
<h3>Written to (Women's Garden)</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>A silent atmosphere permeates our surroundings, making us close to suffocation.</p>
<p>Although women are constantly fighting with the environment, passively resisting: But these meager forces, because they are not united, are finally eliminated by the great pressure.</p>
<p>(Women's (solidarity) is very weak) is a fact, which no one can deny. The unfavorable environment disperses the solidarity of women, which is not a defect of women themselves. Therefore, how should the awakened women now actively unite, concentrate their strength, and under the guidance of a more central idea, systematically, organizedly, and methodically deal with their difficult environment in a consistent manner? But, what is the way to unite these women who are in an unfavorable environment; to gather these individual struggles, resistance, and struggles, and exert great power? I think (text) is the most powerful tool.</p>
<p>Therefore, when (Women's Garden) is first published, I can't help but wish it with twelve points of sincerity</p>
<p>Is the center of women's thought!</p>
<p>Is the tool of women's solidarity!</p>
<p>Is the pioneer of women's movement!</p>
<h3>The Life of a Woman</h3>
<p>— Xuanwen</p>
<p>In this arena of increasingly fierce survival competition, it is not easy to covet life. But people are always greedy for life and afraid of death. To live, one must live healthily. Weak and sickly bodies cannot play a good role on this stage of life. To have a healthy body, it is固 due to constant training and health maintenance, but the congenital is also important. In today's world where human beings have not yet obtained other methods to preserve the race, the health of the mother is even more important. A healthy mother has a healthy fetus; a healthy fetus can easily grow up. After growing up, it can become a healthy citizen. Therefore, the health of a woman's life is not only necessary for her personal survival, but also closely related to the future of national survival. The points that should be paid attention to in (The Life of a Woman) are presented to the readers in paragraphs.</p>
<p>1. Sexual Buds</p>
<p>Byron knew about love at the age of eight, and Dante had a lover at the age of nine. Most smart people are precocious. Under such circumstances, what mothers should pay special attention to is: When does the child's sexual bud occur, and how is it expressed? It all depends on the mother's careful understanding in silent observation and guidance.</p>
<p>When a child's sexual bud first occurs, the most important thing for mothers to pay attention to is whether the child has (self-smear) behavior. Even when children are three or four years old and are still learning to walk, such behavior can cause them to develop indelible bad habits due to certain sensations.</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to: Whether the child is suffering from pinworms丨丨a small worm that often parasitizes at the anus, which can cause the child's anus to itch strangely丨丨because pinworms often like to come out of the anus at night to lay eggs. When it goes back, if it accidentally enters the child's genitals, it will definitely feel itchy and scratch. Scratching will definitely feel pleasure, thus forming the habit of (self-smear). In addition, there are also cases where the child does not clean it after urination, which will eventually lead to strange itching. Scratching can also become the bad habit of (self-smear). However, children in this period are all innocent and lively, and it is a great time to educate them. If the mother can discover her bad habits and give appropriate hints and guidance early, it is not difficult to correct them. In case the mother does not pay attention to her or lets her go, making her develop a habit that she cannot control, and when she reaches the age of breaking her melon, when the spring green blood runs in the fallopian tubes, and at the same time, due to the action of internal secretions, instinctual sexual impulses arise, at this time, the aforementioned bad habits have been difficult to correct, affecting the person's lifelong happiness and health, and even suffering from infertility. Those who are mothers in the world cannot but pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>Genius Labyrinth</h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>In the course of history, many great inventors have appeared. People understand these inventors as (geniuses), believing that their intelligence, wisdom, and talent are innate, saying that they are fundamentally different from ordinary people. If anyone wants to disagree with this, then people with this view will immediately ask: Why could only Watt invent the steam engine, only Stephenson invent the train, only Fulton invent the steamboat, and not others? Isn't this proof that inventors are different from ordinary people?</p>
<p>True, all great inventors are geniuses, and most of them are more intelligent than the average person, but this is only one factor that makes it possible for them to become inventors. What makes this possibility a reality is the environment in which they are situated. Although Watt was intelligent, he would not have been able to invent the steam engine if he had not been an apprentice mechanic and a machinist for the steam engine at the University of Glasgow. Stephenson and Fulton's becoming inventors of trains and steamboats is also inextricably linked to the environment in which they lived.</p>
<p>At the same time, the level of development of social culture is the main condition that determines what kind of inventors all great inventors become. No matter how intelligent a person is, even if his personal living environment is very good, his achievements cannot exceed the level of cultural development of the society in which he lives. Although Kongming was intelligent, he could only invent wooden oxen and flowing horses in the Three Kingdoms period, and could not build trains and steamships; even with the skill of Gongshuzi, he could not build modern-style Western-style houses in the Warring States period; even Watt, Stephenson, and Fulton, as extraordinary as they were, could not have invented huge electric machines in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the demands of the era and society are also constraints on the achievements of all inventors. Watt's invention of the steam engine, Stephenson's invention of the train, and Fulton's invention of the steamboat all emerged with the collapse of feudal society and the growth of modern (civilized society) since the Renaissance. Because modern (cultural society) is built on the foundation of industry and commerce, it needs steam engines, trains, steamboats, etc., so Watt, Stephenson, Fulton, etc. invented them. Watt and others were merely inventors who responded to this need, not superhuman beings above all else. Moreover, we can also say that even without Watt and the like, at most the development of modern (civilized society) would be delayed for some time, but there is no question that this society would inevitably emerge and develop.</p>
<p>Therefore, the talents and achievements of all great inventors are given to them by society and the era, not something innate. They are the same as ordinary people, they are people of the era, people of society, not some (monsters) beyond the era and beyond society. The reason why they can specially invent something among a number of people is mainly because they have a suitable living environment, can see the needs of society and the era, and can work hard under these needs. There is really nothing mysterious or incomprehensible about it.</p>
<p>This theory can not only explain all great inventors, but also be used to explain all great political, academic, and artistic geniuses. The labyrinth of genius can thus be completely opened.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only a scientific understanding of all great inventors and geniuses, and does not deny their contributions to human society.</p>

<h3>Opening Festival Money</h3>
<p>— Fei Qiusheng</p>
<p>I, I am a naive virgin who has not experienced the world. Now I am a minor employee in the XX factory who seems important but is not important, 丨丨 a very, very minor employee. In the minds of my colleagues, there is indeed no such human-like impression. As for me, I also feel that I am not self-respecting enough, and I am always accepting all commands with all my heart, as if this is indeed iron-cast in my fate.</p>
<p>The XX factory is very large, and the workers account for about 96% of the total number of employees. Because the work is very noble, their lives are also above all the workers. Therefore, their horizons and their family fortunes are also tied to their foreheads.</p>
<p>Shusheng is the teaboy in the manager's office 丨丨 a relative of the manager, 丨丨 is a snobbish villain. His salary is more than twice mine, no wonder he shouts and bullies others, relying on his power.</p>
<p>Speaking of my position, it is ultimately one step higher than Shusheng, but it is very difficult to get him to do things. Not only does he not respond to you, but he also gives you an extra fierce look to embarrass you, and sometimes he gives you a sour feeling.</p>
<p>(Hey 丨 Shusheng 丨 Please send this to Mr. Wang, okay?) I said to Shusheng with a smile.</p>
<p>(Who has time? No time 丨 You can go yourself 丨) He put on a straight face and grumbled with a chain of answers.</p>
<p>(Hey 丨 Shusheng! Please ask Mr. Wang to come 丨) Then came the manager's instructions.</p>
<p>(Oh 丨 Oh 丨 Oh 丨 Okay 丨········· Shusheng responded repeatedly and left.</p>
<p>(Shusheng 丨 Then take it to him 丨)</p>
<p>(No 丨 No 丨 I still have to go somewhere else 丨) This is obviously an unreasonable excuse.</p>
<p>But I can't vent my anger as much as possible, I can only open my mouth wide and swallow this sour and spicy feeling. To whom should I complain?</p>
<p>The lunar New Year's Day is approaching again. According to our factory rules, a double salary will be given when paying wages once at the end of the year. Of course, this time will be no exception 丨</p>
<p>I remember it was a bright morning, and the sound of the machines in the factory was already rumbling. I stepped into the director's office and ran into Shusheng head-on.</p>
<p>(Oh 丨 Good morning 丨 Mr. X 丨) This is Shusheng's rare compliment to me. I also inexplicably replied a few times: (Good morning 丨 Good morning 丨 Good morning 丨) He took the teapot to make tea.</p>
<p>The coal in the stove was burning red, moving the entire room out of the cold. At that time, I was the first to arrive in the director's office, and everything was silent, only the raging coal was playing a disjointed tune. Today's special image in the room surprised me at a glance: the things on the desk were always disorganized, but today they were all neatly organized; the dust on the desk was always brushed off with a feather duster, and sometimes it was not brushed at all, but today they were all wiped brightly. Is this a good sign?</p>
<p>Shusheng's tea has been brewed.</p>
<p>(Mr. X 丨 Have some tea 丨) Shusheng put a cup of steaming tea on my desk.</p>
<p>Shusheng's actions and expression today really made me feel surprised. Has he changed? Has he repented?</p>
<p>Everyone knows today is the day to pay double wages, and it's also Saturday, so everyone's faces are full of smiles. The staff in the director's office didn't do anything all day, just talked. The telephone next to the wall was very busy. This one went to find Miss so-and-so, that one went to make an appointment with Ms. so-and-so, and some even suggested opening a room, anyway, tomorrow is Sunday, so they can have a good time. The workers also didn't feel like working. Some people smiled, but most people didn't, they had a group of creditors following them, so they didn't seem happy.</p>
<p>The morning passed in such a blur, and the 5 o'clock that everyone was looking forward to arrived, and the working machines also stopped turning. The workers washed their faces, put on their clothes, and prepared to leave, but the wages had not yet been distributed. The dismissal bell had already rung, and the director's office was immediately crowded with Narma Wens from various departments, inquiring about wages.</p>
<p>Outside the door stood many, many people, almost blocking the alley. What are they doing? They are the workers' creditors.</p>
<p>The clock on the wall had struck six, but the person who distributes the wages had not yet arrived. The workers were standing on the escalators on each floor, all looking at the door of the director's office in unison.</p>
<p>At this time, the manager also became anxious and made six or seven calls to the bank in a row, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>Finally, at half past six, the person from the bank who was sent to distribute the wages arrived. In an instant, the director's office was packed</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>water couldn't leak through, and people pushed and shoved to be the first. The legs of the desks were each moved more than half a foot.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 7 o'clock that the wages were finally distributed, and the people from the bank also left. At that time, all the staff in the director's office had not yet run away.</p>
<p>(Shusheng 丨 Please use these to buy some wine to drink!) The manager handed a ten-yuan bill to Shusheng and said.</p>
<p>(Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you 丨 Mr. X 丨) Shusheng thanked him.</p>
<p>At this time, my brain suddenly became clever; it turned out that Shusheng was so kind today because of·········</p>
<p>One by one, Shusheng received the festival money, and then it was my turn. My heart kept jumping non-stop: my brain was constantly thinking about······</p>
<p>(Ah 丨 If I have to give him four yuan, then I would never want to in my life, and I don't have this money. The double wages I received are not enough for the family's New Year's meals. If I give him two yuan 丨 then if people see it, it will be too stingy. People are giving him four yuan, six yuan, eight yuan. But, no 丨 no 丨 My salary is smaller than others, maybe it won't happen 丨)</p>
<p>But when I looked up and saw his kind and amiable expression today, my heart softened again. Other people's eyes were all focused on me, and my hands couldn't help but tremble.</p>
<p>At this time, most of the people in the director's office had left, so my courage grew again; his usual fierce face also vaguely appeared in my eyes; the sour feelings I had suffered also generally churned out of my chest.</p>
<p>(No 丨 I must give him two yuan 丨) I decided in my heart.</p>
<p>(Shusheng 丨 These are nothing, go have a smoke 丨) I stiffened my head and handed him a two-yuan bill.</p>
<p>(Oh 丨·········· Thank you!) Shusheng took the money, paused, and his eyes darted around a few times.</p>
<p>My face flushed red, and I lowered my head and slipped out in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>Famous People's Speeches</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Yousan's Speech (The Temporality of Youth Cultivation)</h3>
<p>— Notes by Shen Pinru</p>
<p>The explanation of the two words "cultivation" is that on the one hand, people are dissatisfied with reality, and on the other hand, they want to improve their various aspects, constantly striving towards the direction of improving ideals. This direction is what is called cultivation.</p>
<p>(1) Maxims and cultivation use a concise and generalized language as a standard. Usually, maxims are based on the experiences of all successful people who are higher than us as our role models, and are always flawless, but there are also mistakes. For example, (being wise and protecting oneself) is based on personal interests as a prerequisite without regard to the welfare of the public. This is to tell you not to be silly, to sacrifice oneself for the sake of the public, causing many energetic and enterprising youths to become timid and decadent. For example, (serving as an official when the country is prosperous, and retreating when the country is in turmoil) is simply speculation. However, there are many good maxims, but they cannot be used as a model for the entire life. For example, in terms of the country (everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world), this is only a slogan for civic life and cannot take care of the specifics. Therefore, although maxims can help us cultivate ourselves, because the basis is inappropriate or only focuses on one aspect, they cannot serve as a model for the entire life.</p>
<p>(2) Moral principles and cultivation The ancients put forward many words as the goals of cultivation, such as benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, filial piety, diligence, frugality, respect, love, etc. These many moral principles were set by different people and are fundamentally different. How can we learn from them? Moreover, these are abstract and can be hung on the wall to warn us, but they cannot be used as cultivation for the entire life. In addition, these moral principles are also undefined. In ancient times, someone asked Confucius, (How can one be filial?), he said: (Do not violate one's parents for three years). Later he said: (Serve them with propriety when they are alive, bury them with propriety when they die, and sacrifice to them with propriety). Later he said: (Provide them with food and drink), and finally said: (Be respectful in demeanor to be filial). Such moral principles are all empty and not specific. Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace. He also said that they should be promoted and carried forward in accordance with the trend of the times and based on scientific principles, so moral principles are empty and insufficient.</p>
<p>(3) Hero worship and cultivation In youth, people are full of worship. When they encounter or read about successful great men, heroes, and outstanding people in literature, science, politics, and military affairs in books, they always worship them wholeheartedly and use the fine deeds of heroes and great men as our imitation. Although this is specific and whole, and can avoid the bias of maxims and the emptiness of moral principles, there are also two shortcomings: One is external. Heroes are created by the times. It is the need of the times and the urgency of the environment that create them. The second is internal. His innate knowledge, talent, and temperament are particularly high compared to ordinary people. Can another Liu Bei or Yue Fei appear in the Warring States period or the Song Dynasty, or in the present when the times have changed several times? Moreover, Liu Bei's loyalty to one person, although Yue Fei fought for the nation, but he retreated when he received the emperor's order in an emergency, because obedience was more important than fighting against foreign enemies. This is sticking to the monarch. It can be seen that hero worship is not perfect.</p>
<p>(4) The Temporality of Cultivation Based on the above three points, a definition can be obtained, that is, cultivation has temporality. For example, in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, emphasis was placed on Qingtan. All scholars and officials were eloquent and eloquent, but now they are regarded as empty talk and doing nothing. The Song Dynasty was about studying the principles of human nature. If you talked thoroughly, you could become a high official, but it doesn't work now. There is also a saying (The highest virtue is not to speak wildly or act recklessly). This is in terms of China, and there are also some in foreign countries. For example, they must use Latin when writing articles or talking, and they also worship the strange behaviors of samurai and monks. They lock their bodies in the open air, do not eat or drink for several days, and let the sun shine and rain drench them. He said: (A person who can endure the hardship of the flesh will definitely improve his personality.) These are all times that fascinate them, and this kind of cultivation is the most appropriate in this era.</p>
<h3>Diligent Life</h3>
<p>— Jing Ye</p>
<p>(Diligence) is amazing. Many geniuses have used (diligence) to create their works. The Spanish poet Lope de Vega diligently wrote about 2,000 kinds of plays, of which only 500 kinds can be passed down to our time. In addition, he also has other works in 21 volumes and many other poems. The French bookseller Levy was the publisher of many works by the great writer Alexandre Dumas. According to the bookseller's catalogue alone, there are already as many as 300 volumes of these works, but this catalogue is still incomplete. Another example is the female writer George Sand. There is a legend about her that after finishing a novel at two o'clock in the night, she put a pack of blank paper in front of her seat in order to write the first few chapters of another new work. Her surviving works total 109 volumes. The famous mathematician Leonhard Euler has at least 30,000 pages of printed matter in his original manuscripts. In these printed matters, every line is filled with the most difficult problems that people can think of. He was also a particularly good memory. It is said that he memorized the entire book (Odyssey and Iliad) in twenty-two days. In addition, there is the great writer Goethe, whose complete works have now been published in a total of 130 volumes.</p>

<h3>Women and Clothing</h3>
<p>— Ci Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the criticism about women, especially female students (presumably because they are the backbone of the intellectual citizens), that has been talked about the most is the issue of clothing. Because of this, some have issued very stern criticisms, saying that it is Europeanization and luxury. Some angrily say that schools should be closed, saying that this is indeed a phenomenon that cannot be ignored in society. In the current situation where my country's industries are declining and people are living in poverty, the luxury and Europeanization of female students' clothing is accelerating the demise of Chinese society.</p>
<p>Originally, things that were not very serious have become serious after their accusations and criticisms. Now let us study this so-called (serious) matter without prejudice, shall we?</p>
<p>The occurrence and existence of every phenomenon in society has its own basis and background for its occurrence and existence. There is a relationship between cause and effect. There will never be anything that comes out of thin air without a cause. According to this, let us grasp why women's clothing is becoming more and more luxurious. Finally, let's take a look at whether the luxury of women's clothing is, as some people say, the biggest reason for preventing social progress and endangering the country and nation.</p>
<p>We know that under the current social system, the main phenomenon is that everything is becoming commercialized and capitalized. In the process of the transition from feudal system to the current system, women have always been regarded as a part of men's private property. Therefore, when everything becomes commercialized, women are also seen as special commodities. Under the violent oppression of cunning men, women have no room for resistance. The fragile women can only endure humiliation and obey. The oppression of the social environment and the intentional coercion of men have forced them to embark on the path of luxury to increase the price of commodities. What a tragic fact! The luxury of clothing is the oppression of the social environment and the fault of men. It is futile to only make sarcastic jokes, criticisms, and accusations without improving the existing social system and examining one's own faults.</p>
<p>To retreat and talk about the current luxury of women's clothing, especially female students, it is not necessarily a very serious sin, and it is not necessarily the great treason that some people say that prevents public progress and endangers the country. We know that human beings are rational animals and have an innate instinct to love beauty. The development of this instinct is higher in women than in men. As human knowledge progresses, the concept of aesthetics develops even more. As far as men are concerned, I believe that among those who criticize and blame, there must be many who wear high-end suits and silk jackets, so why shouldn't women wear red and green? Is it because not being luxurious and not wearing red and green means expressing patriotism and advocating domestic products? Just look at the facts in society, I am afraid that those who are outwardly simple are big traitors and sellers of foreign goods! As long as they are truly studying knowledge, what is the use of cold ridicule?</p>
<p>Scientific Talks</p>
<h3>Scientific Statistics</h3>
<p>— Chu Mo Translator</p>
<p>(1) Gold and silver in seawater</p>
<p>Seawater contains large amounts of dissolved gold and silver. In one million grams of seawater, we can extract six thousandths of a gram of gold and nineteen thousandths of a gram of silver. It is estimated that the value of gold in seawater is as high as 58.38 trillion marks, and the value of silver is 5.3 trillion marks. Therefore, if we divide these gold and silver equally among the 1.6 billion people on Earth, each person can get 3.5 million marks of gold and 320,000 marks of silver.</p>
<p>(2) Vocabulary of various texts</p>
<p>The various different words or terms needed by people who have received secondary education usually do not exceed two to three thousand. The book (Old Testament) contains about 5,800 different words, the (New Testament) 4,100, Homer's (Odyssey and Iliad) 9,000, Milton's complete works 8,000, and French contains up to 110,000 words, while English has 120,000 words. In addition, Grimm's (Complete German Dictionary), after he supplemented it, can contain about 500,000 different words, terms, or phrases, and all proper names are not included.</p>
<p>(3) Lifespan of animals and plants</p>
<p>Some animals usually live much longer than humans. For example, some shellfish have a lifespan of 100 years, parrots, eagles, vultures, swans, and bald eagles are all over 100 years old, and carp, elephants, and whales are 200 years old. But the longest-lived animal is probably the tortoise. There is a living tortoise in the artillery barracks in Mauritius. It is estimated that it is already 300 years old. A tortoise died in the London Zoo in 1906. It weighed 500 pounds and it was estimated it was 400 years old. During its lifetime, it ate more feed in the summer than a cow needed, but it fasted in the winter. In 1911, someone caught a tortoise and found words left on its back, but these words were left in 1793.</p>
<p>Some trees also live for a very long time. There was such a tree in India (but it has now fallen), and according to the scientists' judgment, it sprouted more than 7,000 years ago. In that case, when Abraham Lincoln was alive, it had already lived for several millennia</p>

<p>According to recent research results in the scientific community, bees cannot see red, but bees can see ultraviolet rays that are beyond human eyesight.</p>
<p>German inventor A. Rohrback is now designing a new type of aircraft that can move forward or backward, or stay motionless in the air, as the driver wishes.</p>
<p>There is a poisonous lake in Panama called (Dead Lake). The bones of birds and animals are piled around the lake, all of which died after tasting the water in the lake. People who drink it cannot escape death either. Therefore, the locals do not want to get close to this lake. The reason why this lake is poisonous is because the stones at the bottom of the lake contain arsenic.</p>
<p>According to a report by three scientists from an American dairy company, the amount of vitamin A contained in milk and butter depends entirely on whether the hay eaten by the cow is good.</p>

<p>Special Self-Employment Introduction</p>
<h3>Army Captain</h3>
<p>— Scholar</p>
<p>丨丨Until now, useless in everything</p>
<p>Just begging for food in the world 丨丨</p>
<p>I am a scholar. I started working at the age of twenty, and now I am forty-two. In these twenty-two years, although I have experienced unemployment, this is the first time I have been unemployed for such a long period.</p>
<p>Speaking of this unemployment, it is somewhat unjust. I was originally a captain secretary in a certain regiment. Because that regiment was going to Jiangxi, my family, seeing that I was no longer young, did not want me to travel far to Jiangxi, and told me to resign. Who knew that this resignation would plunge me into famine. From August last year until now, I have not been able to find a job. At that time, it was said that Jiangxi was too far away and dangerous; but now, there is no way to go anywhere, and there is no place further away. All that remains is the danger of hunger, approaching day by day. The old wife needs to be supported, and the young children need to be fed, but the falling snowflakes cannot be used as clothing, and the falling tears cannot be exchanged for rice. Seeking friends, friends avoid you; seeking relatives, it is still the same as running into a wall.</p>
<p>Because I am a scholar, I have no other skills, only having learned a good hand of Zhao calligraphy that everyone loves. Running script is used for writing letters, and regular script is used for copying official documents, but what is the use? Submitting articles is not easy, and it is even more difficult to exchange for money to buy rice immediately. If you can write a good official document, no one asks you now, and it is worthless. The Book of Poetry and Confucius' sayings certainly cannot be exchanged for money, and social democracy cannot bring rice. This is the skill of a scholar, and now I want to exchange it for a meal in the world. I wonder who needs this skill?</p>
<p>Incidentally, because I have a family, living expenses should be at least forty yuan, and board and lodging are required. I am healthy and have no habits, which should also be stated here. Please forward correspondence through this publication.</p>
