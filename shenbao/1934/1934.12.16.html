<p>考洋米入口瀕增之原因。約有數端。一則因我國米産不敷自給。據近年國府主計處之統計。大多數省區之糧産。均與人口數不相稱。平均全國年缺三千萬石左右。故非賴洋米巨量入口。以資補充不可。二則因腹地各省。交通未關糧運困難。緃遇豐年大熟。亦有不能外運之苦。是以需米特多之各大都市。因與國外交通便利。皆採購洋米。調劑民食。三則因各地捐税繁重。省爲政。囤積居奇。封境遏糶等等不合理之情形。往往而有。此其足以促進洋米入口。彰彰明甚。四則因隣近各國。每遇米産豊收。爲維持其國内之米價安定及農民生計起見。卽施行傾銷政策。以我國爲其過剩米糧之尾閭。有此四端。遂致年年皆有巨額洋米入口。固不論國内産米區域之收成如何也。　有時國米産量。不敷自給。洋米乘虚而入。遂有人主張雜糧代米。及改進米産以謀抵制。至於造成洋米進口之其他原因。自更應設法消除。庸有疑義。若開關交通。廢除苛雜。取締壟斷。禁止封境遏購。與夫審度情形。徵收洋米累進入口税。皆爲切要之圖。職者固言之壓矣。第吾人於此。覺尚有應行提倡之一事。卽望公家及早建築井充實各地糧倉是也。按此舉之利益甚多。㈠鎮定人心。抑低糧價。㈡國内存米往往在囤積居奇者手。欲待善價而後。沽。政府旣儲大批米糧。若輩將感覺壟斷乏術。手頭卽有存米。亦必急於出糶。國米供給。可以增多。㈢各地封境遏糶。無非在預防當地糧荒。公家若有大批米糧存儲。便可有恃無恐。不至再有省自爲政之弊。㈣萬一有米荒之時。奸商滑賈。雖思趁火打劫。壟斷把持。亦有技窮之嘆。㈤積糓防飢。古有明訓當今世界之風雲日亟。人各自危。此舉尤不可忽也。</p>
<p>其次所欲商榷者。卽將何以充實各地之糧倉。吾人以爲今日公家欲收買米糧存儲。當以向南洋華僑米商採購爲原則。蓋一則不至影響國内米價。再則亦可補助僑胞之經濟。反之如就國内採購。有無餘糧供應。固成問題。卽能大批收買。糧價势必從而抬高。亦應顧慮。然或者則調向南洋購米辦法。不免有二弊焉。一則國内豐收省分。將受影響。而使榖價低跌。轉以病農。二則購進洋米。仍不免於利權外溢。與吾人前説。似相矛盾。不知此皆不足以惶惑也。蓋購進此種洋米者。係公家而非個人。且皆係儲藏性質。非至厧告米荒或有其他不得已之情形時。又不以出糶。何至奪國米尋常之銷路。况國米價格如能低於洋米。大批收買後。不致從而抬高。自不妨先加採購。無奈國内際此旱災之後。未必能有大量餘米。可供收買儲存。而在國米售價太高之會。公家亦有購進洋米以求其平之需要也。至謂利權外溢。固所不免。然旣向僑商購進。尙不能謂完全外溢。且就大體而論。較諸國米爲私人所囤積。各地封境遏糶。反向國外購米　　之　　　　　也。</p>

<p>軍備競爭另一方式</p>
<p>科學比賽更進一步</p>
<p>倫敦海軍預備談話、祇有英·美·日·三個海軍國、其前途何如、凡是留心世界問題及明瞭太平洋形勢的人、都能預知他類有好果、况他們各有所長、英國的海軍、是踞海上王座的、所以他的主力戰艦、比美日兩國都强、一萬噸以下的巡洋艦、雖不及日本精鋭、但數量多、組織力大、美國則以航空母艦見長、「林辛頓」是戰艦改造的、能載八十多架飛機、每點鐘有三十三海里的速力、是英日兩國所不及的、日本的潛行艇、艦型差不多相同、其攻擊</p>
<p>的效能、比大戰期中德國用的、亦高過兩倍以上、</p>
<p>世界海軍國家、在過去幾年間、都在暗中競爭、各顯所長、德國誠然是戰敗國、但全國上下、没有一個人忘去了復仇、忘去了振與其國的任務、可是他爲凡爾賽和約束縳、海軍祇准有一萬五千兵、軍艦祇能有舊式「德意志·蘭德」級艦六艘、這是何等苦腦的事、所以希特勒振臂一呼、全德人民、四起響應、固然希氏善於利用環境、深悉德國歷史的傳统、而德意志民族的剛强奮發、尤爲其中要素、</p>
<p>德國海軍受着嚴重的制限、旣不能造軍艦、又不能造飛機、那末該怎樣辦呢、到一九二八年、照絛約規定、允許他建造一艘代舊「德意志·蘭德」的新艦了、但是還有一重限制、該艦的噸數不得超過一萬噸、載砲必須在十一时口徑以下、他在一九三一年進水、去年完工的新「德意志·蘭德」號、所謂袖珍軍艦的就是、</p>
<p>這艘軍艦噸位雖小、載砲也不大、但却是世界上第一艘堅固有力的戰艦、首先值得我們注意的、該艦每塊鋼板相啣接的地方、並不曾有一顆鋼釘、而是用最新式的電氣熔接法、因此節省出艦身重量來裝載兵器、其節省的重量、計有五百五十噸、其次是裝備第則（内燃重油機）八座、每座有七千一百匹馬力、合計全艦有五萬六千八百馬力的機器、又輕便、又敏速、再次、是他所搭載的口徑十一时的大砲了、這些大砲、不消説是德國第一流鋼廠丨克慮伯鋼廠丨所製的頭等鋼作成的、砲身比較尋常的十一时砲長了許多、其砲彈·每發計重六百七十磅、我們看見砲身較平常的砲長、就晓得砲彈的初速度是很大的、砲彈的射程、有二萬七八千米逹、仰角爲六十度、此三點都是現代各强國所有的軍艦、不經見的成績、</p>
<p>還有一點、現代普通軍艦所少有的、就是該艦中央部蓋得有裝甲鋼板、上層甲板、也分裝兩層、有防空的設備、該艦最高速率爲二十六海里、如果保持二十海里的速度、其績航力可以有一萬海里、從上海到西雅圍、往返可以不上水、不加油、這眞是袖珍艦啊、</p>
<p>該艦頭尾、許長六百零六呎、寛六十七呎半、吃水二十一呎半、計載十一时砲六門、六时砲八門、三·四时高射砲四門、一九·七时魚形水雷六門、這些兵器的鋭利、不减於二萬噸的軍艦罷、無怪世界驚異、認爲創造兵器界的新記錄了、這艘軍艦的建造、費去了三百七十五萬磅、（若每磅以十六元合算、就値六千萬華銀了）、今年可竣工的姊妹艦丨「阿德未拉爾·夏以外、還有兩艘正在建造之中、德國目前的財政、是極度困難的時期、對外貿易、也毫無起色、可是他還是力爭上游、一方面堅持軍備平等、一方面努力建立相當軍備、又有科學作後盾、盡量發揮共組織力、前途緃未敢樂觀、而其努力向上、確値得我們欽佩、（十一月八日於柏林）</p>

<p>美專員主張繼續受美保護二十五年</p>
<p>— 文初</p>
<p>日本素主南進北進政策、北進是以武力侵略大陸、南進是以經濟侵略南洋、北進雖有大部分成就而尙在熱烈進行、南進亦並不因此放鬆、故最近因日貨傾銷印荷各屬、而引起日英衝突、日荷衝突已不少、菲律賓爲南洋之一部、現主人翁爲美國、與日本甚爲逼近、自太平洋風雲日緊、日本在軍事上經濟上之進行、更爲努力、故自美國成立菲律賓十年後獨立案後、在菲人之有達大眼光者、卽抱悲觀、恐將來爲满洲第二也、然日本在菲律賓勢力究竟如何、當亦爲關心東方問題者所願知、請略述概要如左、</p>
<p>三十年前、日人在菲島者寥寥無幾、除小販生涯外、别無建樹當時美國初領菲島、南方有所謂納卯者地廣人稀、政府任人領地開墾、一九零四年、日人太田恭三郎來此經營小商業、深知該地種植有望、乃赴台灣與當道結交、以納卯墾植之策、獻於台灣總腎、總督深以爲可、出資百萬爲股本、貴族富商亦多加入、太田乃携資來納卯、設立太田與業株式會社、作大規模之墾植、由是開荒蕪、築道路、與水利、造碼頭、日本農工繼續前來、以稱麻爲正業、其種植及抽剝參用科學方法、故出産品織維韌長與潔白、爲菲島各處冠、彼皆輸往日本工廠、製成蔴織品、再輸入菲島消售、現納卯經關爲通商口岸、每星期皆有日本大輪船直接來往、初中日移民、在菲政府有同一之規定、旋因彼國勢富强、政府視與歐美人均等地位、（所謂移民律者、乃取締中印韓三國人民也）農工商人、祇憑日領一紙介紹書、不必經移民局調查、亦不必費二十元印花費領取居留證、卽可通行羣島、而以納卯爲大本營、故在納卯日僑聚居之區、有學校、有醫院等組合、太田會社而外、又有古川會社、其規模亦極偉大、現納卯直成爲日僑世界、據日領佈告、其人口佔羣島中日僑三分之二、又菲議會自一九一九年通過外人不得在菲佔有地産權、據日領佈告、謂日僑在納卯所購土地、祇有二千五百公頃、皆在一九一九年前合法購得者、但本年菲島制憲會議代表開幕、納卯省區代表公開演説、揭出日僑在該省購地之黑幕、謂省當局緃容該區日僑發展地産、未嘗謀救濟之道　蓋納卯之上流人物、往往向政府購買地皮後、隨卽轉售該處日僑、自此報告發出後、菲島各報卽登出警告新聞、引起菲人注意、不圖不久又有私運軍火案之案發生、</p>
<p>納卯區代表旣揭發購地黑幕後、岷蘭姥省（與納卯比鄰）代表更作重要之報告、謂曾接得秘密消息、日僑用日船私運軍火入納卯　且秘藏於日人塡墓内云云、此問題自屬更加嚴重、蓋日人用意所在、乃以納卯爲一稱軍事假定性的根據、對於未來日美戰爭、有絶大威脅、此更引起美菲當局絶大注意者也、</p>
<p>不但此也、日漁船之侵入菲島領海、亦數見不鮮、有時且發現偷書地圖事、菲當局無從深究、最近更發現巴撈灣（南方一省）日漁船海陽丸偷運炸藥及違禁物、憲兵警察登船搜查、被該船水手開槍將憲兵打倒、且將屍擲入海中、肇事之船向台灣疾駛而去、雖經菲海關四巡洋艦總動員追捕、卒無所獲、菲政府欲以法律續辦理引渡、台灣日當局及東京報界、皆拒絶引渡、表示强硬態度、菲政府亦無法庭處置、將來祇有成爲懸案、以不了了之而已、</p>
<p>至兩國在菲之商業勢力、日本比美國、更有飛突猛進之勢、據美國商務之佈告、一九三二年菲總入口一五九七九萬元、美貨一○二九八萬、約佔百分之六五、一九三三年菲總入口一四九三六萬元、美貨八七五七萬、約占百分之五九、一九三二年、日貨入菲祇九四五萬元、一九三三年增至一九一三萬元、一年中增至百分五十餘、已顯露其取美貨而代之之勢矣、現菲島猶未脱離美國關係、而日本之行動已如此、則口頭上所謂保證菲島獨立者、焉知獨立後、不再唱亡朝鮮占東北之舊調、且謂欲保持東亞和平、不得不置菲島於勢力範圍之下、因此而更引起菲人之自危、故菲駐美專員倪搭氏、前月赴美履任時、曾對在菲美報『武力鎭』記者發表談話、主張菲島在此去二十五年中、仍須繼續依頼美國之保護、氏又於本月二十四日在美國發言、謂『非人畏懼日本、其安全有頼於美國繼續保護、至菲商界及其他各界多人、近亦開始運動、將向下月間到非之美國會　考察團呈遞請願書、請求美國會將泰丁獨愈（美議員提出非獨立案者）獨立案中、規定之非島十年過渡時期、延長爲二十年、非議會案主張卽刻獨立派者、對以上提議、尙未敢表示意見、亦可見畏懼日本之深矣、（十一月三十日於非島首都岷黑刺）</p>

<p>— 康健爾夫</p>
<p>「飛將軍從天而降」，這是一句古話，現代的空中戰爭，可就應了這名話啦。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你知道飛機戰爭的利害嗎？你知道世界各强國積極的在那裏準備世界二次在戰嗎？你知道那「戰神」不久便要光臨嗎？</p>
<p>事實很明顯的呈露在我們的眼前；據最近各國軍用飛機數目，法國有三千架；蘇俄有二千八百至三千架；美國有二千四百六十八架；日本有一千六百架；意大利和英格蘭各有一千五百架。這都是準備應付着未來的空中戰爭的。</p>
<p>各國用在軍事上的每年費用，比較二十年前，世界大戰前夕的軍費要加上幾倍。例如意大利較前增加百分之二十六；贡國增加百分之四十八；美國增加百分之一百九十；（即一倍又十分之九。）日本增加百分之三百八十八。（便是四倍不到一些。）</p>
<p>這些劍拔弩張的情形，不是戰神光臨的預兆嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們生在這個時代，大難臨頭，要快快準備起來！快快團結起來！</p>

<p>— 盧瓊餘</p>
<p>美國的汽車大王丨福特先生，想必諸位已經聽見過了，我現在來把他幼時結果實踐的夢想，介紹給諸位，我想：諸位一定是樂聞的吧丨</p>
<p>福特在六歲的時候，便上學了。因爲他非常的聰明，所以他在學校裹，成績很好，但他總覺得尃謮死書，没有甚麽興味，倒不如研究一種實用的物件更好，所以他在課餘的時候，把時計拆開，細細地研究，他這樣的用心研究，不上一年，對於時計的各部組織，都已很明瞭，這樣他竟成了一個小修理鐘表師，俢了幾年鐘表，他有些厭倦了，便想自已製造鐘表，那時候，他已得了父親的允許，到一家機器廠裹去當學徒，這時候，他在空閒的時候，便研究造表的機器，結果，竟發明了一種新的造表機，據他當時的計算，每天能造表數百個之多。這時他才十七歲呢！</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友呀！我希望你們也有福特先生那樣的思想和願望，這樣，中國的前途才有一綫希望。</p>
<h3 id="c273">冬 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 杜鵑</p>
<p>樹葉子枯了，落了，</p>
<p>失了自主力的它，</p>
<p>隨着一陣風起，</p>
<p>在郊外蕭蕭地哀鳴。</p>
<p>哦，原來冬已來臨！</p>
<p>寒風漸漸地暴躁，</p>
<p>氣溫慢慢地降低，</p>
<p>小蟲兒不堪自然的摧殘，</p>
<p>死的死了，眠的也都眠了。</p>
<p>哦，原來這是冬的啟示！</p>
<p>冬來了，</p>
<p>一切的景象都蕭條了；</p>
<p>隨着這大雪紛飛，</p>
<p>冷透了各個的心窩。</p>
<p>但，嚴冬嚴冬，</p>
<p>在你壓迫下而熱血奔騰的，</p>
<p>便是我們兒童！</p>
<h3 id="c274">立志做一個飛行家 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>人類交通，除了陸上水上之外，更已擴充到空中，飛機飛船的航行，其便利和輕快，眞是人們所意想不到的，所以二十世紀的世界，實在是人類戰勝天空的時代。非特將來的交通，要在空中，就是軍事上的戰爭，也必自水上陸上而移到空中，因爲空中的戰爭，更有勝利的把握。　　　　歐美各國，對於航空事業，有極大的興趣，所以航空事業的發逹，着實驚人。小朋友！想來你們都知道本年十月十二日，有六個國家的飛機二十架，從英國倫敦到澳州新金山，作一萬多哩的長途飛行比賽，結果是一架名呌彗星號的，只費了七十一時十八分的時間，奪到了冠軍，可見他們對航空事業興趣的熱烈了。</p>
<p>我們中國，如果要抵抗外國的侵略，必需擴充空軍，不久以前，大家熱心地捐欵購買飛機，這是很令人高興的一回事。可是我要更進一步，希望小朋友們立志做一個飛行家，那麽將來和外國戰爭的時候，就可爲國効勞了。</p>

<p>— 珠明</p>
<p>美國法官馬崙氏，早年失去雙手，但他旣做了法官，清理案牘，是要寫字的，旣失去雙手，又怎樣寫法呢，凡有紀錄，他用唇齒銜筆，寫起字來，委宛轉自如，每六十小時内，能清理案牘至四百餘件之多，這不是很特别嗎！（見銅圖）　　小朋友，你們生有健全的雙手，却往往不會寫好字，不是間架不匀，就是歪邪不正，因然是由於年紀小，尙待練習，但是若不注意時時練習，將來終不會有長進的。</p>
<p>我們旣是中國人，當然要會寫中國字；愈是有好學問的人，愈是能寫出很好的字。</p>
<p>習字每天不在多，只要有恒心，天天寫大字若干，小字若干，或一天寫大字，一天寫小字，俗語説：「字無百日功」，只要天天不問斷，持之有恒，没有不會好的。</p>
<p>馬崙氏失去雙手，不得已用唇齒銜筆來寫字，至於寫字執筆方法，也是很要緊的，約略説來，大指和二指要用力握緊，手背要圓，手掌要空，寫出字來才有勁，在此順带告訴你。</p>

<p>— 公望</p>
<p>有一個魔術家，他在預備開演的時候，覺得需要一個孩子去帮助他，所以他就呌他的兒子來，告訴他怎樣做法。</p>
<p>「湯麥斯！要留心，你决不可以被人家知道是我的兒子·你必須假裝不認識我，知道嗎？······」他警告他的兒子道</p>
<p>「知道了丨父親！」湯麥斯很溫柔的回答。</p>
<p>到了開演的時候，魔術家问道：「有誰願意上來帮助我嗎？」</p>
<p>湯麥斯很快的爬上戲台上去了！魔術家回過頭來對他説：「很好！你願意來帮助我嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的！」湯麥斯説。</p>
<p>「以前你看見過我嗎？」魔術家問。</p>
<p>「没有！父親！我從來没有看見過！」湯麥斯很快的回答。</p>

<p>（一）雌蟹生卵。（二）由卵孵出的幼蟲（放大）。（三）稍長像蝦。（四）幼蟹第一次脱壳後才像他的父母。（五）幼蟹最後一次脱殻。（六）蟹以植物·魚·蟲·介類爲食。（七）蟹和蟹常常兇惡地相打。（八）打敗的蟹，斷了一螯，能够復生。</p>
<p>小朋友們，這兩三個月來，你們吃過蟹麽？研究過蟹的種麽？蟹，海裹河裹都有。河蟹常在岸旁掘洞住着。雌的臍圓，雄的臍尖。雌的身體和螯較雄的小。雌蟹在泥沙裹掘了洞，産卵在裹面，用後脚把卵排列開來，再拿泥沙掩在上面。過了一個時候，幼虫由卵裹孵化出來了，牠們是很小很小的。漸長，很像蝦的形狀。等到第一次脱了壳，才和他們的父母相像。每脱一次殻，身體就大一些。脱壳的情形是這樣的；本來的硬壳從後部裂開，新的軟蟹就顯出來了，不久，就長成了硬殻。蟹們常常相打，把螯折斷，但是它們會長出新的來。你們到河邊去捉蟹，如果只捉住它的一隻脚，它會使隻馬上脱落，而快快逃走，原來它的螯和脚都是易脱而能復生的，這不是很有趣麽？</p>

<p>申夫人不知有什麽用，呌僕役去量一升黄荳和一升赤荳；可是那僕役不小心，竟把量來的黄荳和赤荳打翻在一起了。申夫人非常震怒，把那僕役駡了一頓。一面把黄荳送出來，呌春哥夏姊，秋弟，冬妹，揀開來。黄荳歸黄荳，赤荳歸赤荳。因此四位小朋友就實行分工合作，兄弟揀黄荳，姊姊揀赤荳。</p>
<p>申先生聽了伊夫人的駡聲，慌忙從書室裹走出來問着什麽事，經伊夫人説明了原因，他繞跑到四位小朋友面前，看四位小朋友正在起勁揀荳；兩位揀着黄的，兩位揀着赤的。申先生看了，説：「！你們太笨了，又何必四人分着揀黄的赤的呢？假使你們四人同時揀着黄荳，黄荳揀完了，怕剩下來的不是赤荳嗎？而且功夫也省了一半。」四位小朋友聽了都十分贊成。</p>

<p>動物的食量　我們到了動物園裹，看見許多奇形怪狀的動物，這等動物所吃的東西，就我們未曾看見的虎豹獅象説起來實在要驚人的。譬如獅子的食量，每天餵牛馬肉七八斤，牛乳五六斤，活兎一匹，每天起碼要吃三元錢的東西，象原爲大食家，每天要吃蕃薯三四十斤，蘿蔔三四斤，稻草二十餘斤，雜草五六斤，其食費，要五元以上，白熊每日吃魚肉一斤半，麫包二斤半，牛乳二斤，每日約費洋一元半，虎豹比獅，食物都同，不過分量稍少，但也須在二元左右，駱駝與白熊，適相其反，無論什麽都會吃的，如麥，草，鹽，爲其主要食物每天要吃十五斤左右，但是食品的價不貴，費了二三角，就可以飼餵，其他動物的食量，雖然有多有少，有精有粗，那就不能完全分明了。</p>

<p>隨着「復古」的風雲，先有禁男妇同浴······之令，復有婦女們歸回家庭的口號，料想在這古色古香的新中國新時代裹，貞節碑坊，也許又會重新被耆遺少們抬出來，做提倡舊道德，發揚固有文明的幌子吧，果然！本月八日「中華日報」上有如下的一段記載··</p>
<p>廣州訊··「番禺大羅村鄕，乃馬陳黄三姓聚族而居，各有子弟數千人，以出外」</p>
<p>謀生居多，近該鄕紳耆等爲提倡舊道德藉挽頹風起見，日前議决將學欵盈餘撥出三千金，調查三姓中之孀婦，不論年齡，凡有守節逾三年以上者均入選，在天后廟蓋搭彩棚一座，聯宴三姓族中孀婦，名曰，「節婦宴」，於本月夏歷十日下元節舉行。查陳馬黄三姓中，其有孀婦四百一十三口，最老之婦，爲馬陳氏，八十歲，守寡五十一年，居首席，最年輕都，爲陳黄氏，現年僅二十二歲十七歲時已喪所天，居末位。先由副鄕長陳增齡，恭請各婦入席，演講孔經及前清立坊旌表節婦，席中各婦，均動容恭聽，異常歡悦，至晚始拍照而散。」才爭得法律上的貞操共守的具文下，忽來了這樣一個好消息，異使人感到哭笑不得！</p>
<p>孀婦守節，中國過去的法律中丨丨民國初年，尙有烈女節婦的褒揚條例丨丨曾明文褒獎的，然而現行的法律上，孀婦再醮，已認爲合法的行爲了！想不到革命策源地的廣東，居然會有這種復古與反革命的美舉！這，使我們長暵「革命兮革在何處？」以外，同時知道在社會制度依舊的現在，法律眞是具文而已，舊勢力盤旋着的現社會，它是製造吃人的禮敎的源泉，它可無視法律，無視一切。</p>
<p>「食色性也」這是古聖之言，復古的提倡者，當也不會否認的，女子是人，她也有人性，請問泥古者，怎樣來解答？節婦宴上，有守寡五十一年的八十老嫗，也有守節已逾五年的二十二少艾，她們在舊禮敎的桎梏下，渡着違背自然的時光，過着悲痛悽凄的歲月。所謂「動容恭聽，異常歡悦，」怕是那些昏庸老朽的耆紳們，糊塗腦海中的幻夢而已，不然亦只是迫於權威下的强歡笑吧！</p>
<p>舊禮敎！舊禮敎這無形的猛虎，過去的姐妹們，被牠生吞剝的，何止千千萬萬！因門户開放，牠曾稍稍匿跡，現在隨着復古風雲，又在捲土重來了。婦運的團體，快來撲滅這洪水猛獸！</p>
<h3 id="c284">現階段的中國勞働婦女 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 胡關露</p>
<p>誰都知道中國是一個半殖民的各半建的國家。中國的勞働婦女丨丨專指數目最大的體力勞働婦女丨丨當然，一部份是在農村中受着封建地主的蹂躪，那更多的部份就是生活在殖民地的主人所經營的工廠資本的統制之下。</p>
<p>中國的都市是受着資本主義列强的支配，中國的農村也是同樣地不僅是間接，而是直接地在我們這殖民地的主人資本主義國家的影響之下生存。現在我們要知道中國勞働婦女的生活，是要先注意直接加給這些勞働婦女們影響的資本主義的狀况了。</p>
<p>資本主義發展到最高的時期，就是表現出牠的不平衡的發展和矛盾的時期。在這個時期中，資本主義的特徵：</p>
<p>㈠資本與生産的集中。銀行由中間人手上轉到全能的襲斷家手裹，金融寡頭統治的建立增加了「資本集中壟斷形成的過程」的很大的速度。</p>
<p>㈡銀行資本與工業資本愈變愈聯合；銀行變成了生産的大主人，而金融資本，佔據了經濟和政治上的支配地位。</p>
<p>㈢資本的輸出佔了經濟政策上的特别重要的地位。整個的資本主義國家變成了「寄生蟲」的國家和「和食租國」；這國家中增加了整批的食租者，他們的獨一無二的任務就是剪紅利票劵；旣不生産也不分配，只是一些坐享的消費者。</p>
<p>㈣根據上面的幾種要素，資本主義瓜分世界的本質已經完備了。在這時候資本主義已經發展到了牠的最後階段，所謂是帝國主義階段了。這階段的最後一個鮮明的標幟，就是國際壟斷的組織的表現。也就是要瓜分世界，創造各人自已的殖民地的表現了。</p>
<p>資本主義發展到最高個時期，是帝國主義時期，也就是總危機的時期；這時期不是資本主義矛盾發展的組織化，成熟期，避亂所，而是動亂，恐慌，需要另尋出路的一個時候了。</p>
<p>資本主義在現在已經是到了這樣一個時期了，生産過剩，金融恐慌，向殖民地的進攻，都是牠的表現。</p>
<p>自然，尋求殖民地是目前資本主義國的出路，尋求更大的殖民地，是牠們更大的出路。中國是地廣人多的國家，也就是最能供牠們要求的國家。年來中國的農村破産，和一般人民生活的更殖民地化，資本主義的恐慌給與我們的侵略是表現得無微不至了。</p>
<p>但是在這種侵略之下，最受剝削的是體力勞働者，而生活更不堪的是勞働婦女。</p>
<p>我們現在分開都市的勞働婦女和農村的勞働婦女來説罷。</p>
<p>都市的勞働婦女除開最少數的充當家庭的僱傭外，大都是工廠的女工丨丨失業的也在内丨丨。資本主義國家的制度，一般的女工和童工的工資是少於男工的。還從這一點上可以證明，資本主義國家的制度，根本就是重男輕女；把婦女看成是無能力的，低價的，或者説是不能負責和獨立地去勞働，她們的能力和對於别人的信願是只能和未成年的人丨丨童工丨丨去相比的。資本主義的制度把不勞働的婦女看成商品，勞働的婦女看成幼童。在這一點上，受着現階段資本主義侵略的中國勞働婦女，是已經陷在不能生活的地位了。</p>
<p>現在我們先看都市的勞働婦女。除開了那些人業的勞動婦女不算，只看近年來在業的工廠女工的生活罷：</p>
<p>上海輕工業廠中女工的人數是很多的。企業家利用「女工的工資比男工低」這一個辦法，在輕工業的廠裹喜歡招收女工。輕工業廠裹報酬最高，工作也比較好做的可以算是織綢工廠。綢廠裹的熟練工人，綢子織得最好的每月可以織四十元以上的工錢。但是像這樣的工資的收入，在幾百女工的工廠裹是不容易有幾個人得着的；而且像這樣的工資數目，在一個女工一年的工作中是不容易有幾個月得着的。因爲無論任何一個工人，一年中疾病請假的事體是不可免的；爲了機噐和原料品出了毛病，因此織壤了綢子。受了處罰，扣了工資的事體也是不可免的；誰都不能完完全全地，每月都得着她理想的報酬。</p>
<p>上面的情形是指少數的熟練工人而言；熟練工人是要有許多條件：做工的年限多，綢子織得好，「年青力壯」。</p>
<p>至於一般的情形呢：新工必定要交了三十元丨交不出來的免人，這是綢廠特别的也是必要的手續丨保證金，然後入廠當學徒。學徒年限是無定的，機會好，早一些學會，機會不好，會延長到一年以上。學徒期間是没有工資的。學會了以後，要等待廠裹分派自已機器，假如那時工廠没有空閒的機器派給自已的時候，是不能得着額定的工資的丨在别人機上織的發品，工資只能照幾成算。</p>
<p>綢廠生活是女工最好的生活。其次就是紗廠和絲廠了。紗廠裹一般都是没有吃飯的時間，吃飯時不停機器，飯是和着棉絮吃的。工資的數目每天只四五毛錢。</p>
<p>絲廠和其他工廠也是和這相似的情形。女工拿了這樣數目的工錢，不但要供飬自已，還要拿回家去供餋她們的父母，兒女，和失業的丈夫。</p>
<p>婦工生産前後旣没有休息期，請假又得扣全部的薪金。過着這種勞働生活的婦女，往往在年青的生産期間，就損失了她終身的康健！</p>
<p>資本主義危機對於中國的侵略，把本來不曾解放的下層「奴隸」婦女，拖到機器下邊，充當殖民地的母牛。</p>
<p>以上是都市的勞働婦女生活。再看農村的勞働婦女：</p>
<p>也是因了資本主義的危機向我們進攻，中國的農村經濟，淪落到支離破碎的地步。當然，從事於四時耕耘的農民，依靠自已去生産本來就不能生活；加之，快要破産的地主，更强烈地向他們取利，以維持自已的安逸。在這樣地條件之下，農村的勞働婦女是怎麽樣去活呢？</p>
<p>丈夫把所有的勞力賣出去，不够維持一家的生活，婦女只得去幹自已所不願意幹而不能幹的事體了。不顧自已的體力去作田野山林的事體，疾病，生産和育兒期間不事休息；以一個兼了家庭僕役，兼了人母人婦，兼了鷄鴨犬猪看守者的責任，而投到田野裹去工作的婦女，她們是顧不得一切的衰老，疾病，犠牲去服侍她們一切的主人，維持自已的生命，然而，實在是，犠牲了未來的生命維持現在的生命。這樣的勞働婦女，她們是决没有閒心，也决没有可能去打點到自已的終身，自已的幸福，自已的現在和未來的康寗。　　中國這半封建的國家，婦女本來就不曾打破舊來的束縛，特别是勞働階層的婦女，靠着被人鄙賤的勞力，家庭瑣碎的服務；靠着被動的性機器，買出自已不自由的生活；然而這種生活還不算是最苦的。近年資本主義深刻化給與她們的贈與；保持了她們舊有的生活而加給了她們新的勞働，是使現在的勞働婦女便於疾病和死亡的。　　　中國的勞働婦女們，如果要想得着解放，得着人的生活，反封建尤其反這種外來侵略的努力，絶對不是靠着别人，而是自已的任務！</p>
<h3 id="c285">我的婚姻問題 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 洪華</p>
<p>婚姻這問題，在我眞是一種生活上的鬥爭。跟着時代的進展，自已認識之獲得，這鬥爭，幾乎是一部社會機構的縮影。</p>
<p>當我還在我母親胎孕中的時候，就作爲父親縫繫友好的交誼的禮物，預定爲某某人的所有物了。環境給我的封鎖與禁錮，而性愛的要求又如同烈火焚燒着；我如一個俘虜，被携取制服在封建的鐵籠中了。那個陌生者，所謂丈夫，對我無論何項賞受的任性要求，他必使我滿意；在他眼中，我是如神樣的被尊敬；他知道得清楚，一切社會的風習與法律，像是通過電流的鐵綱似的，層層密佈在我們家庭的周圍，我這個被豢餋的神是無從逃跑的。再没有比這起源於財産私有，宣言男子對女子的絶對支配的一夫一妻制的虚僞可恥了丨他一面用善良歡愉的臉，掩蓋那野獸兇殘的内心，範圍我馴服的爲他消愁解悶，爲他無條件的服役；一面他肆無顧忌的找求他情愛之滿足。丨這是何等滑稽兒戲呵！終於，我跳出這個罪惡的圈套。</p>
<p>出發於個人主義的性愛的要求的自由戀愛，便是我這個從封建家庭解放出來的囚犯的道路。然而，這生活給我是十分不快意的。雖然我不能否認我是以獨立的人格，表徵於兩性關係上的那偉大意義，但在這愛的懹抱中，我的生命靜止的窒息了，恍惚我是個蓋棺論定了的死尸；一切的一切，在我已失掉了光輝，我如同鈶樣倦怠的心似的死寂。我的經濟獨立的意義，當爲使新（小）家庭更春光旖旎而必須獲得職業。我的愛人如我一樣，彼此以整個心身獻給愛情，忠實於愛情。戀愛是神聖的嗎？這是欺人的話！「愛」正如生命一樣，牠要求着開展，要求着新的適應；牠就是創造的自身。必然的，這關係（虛僞的自由戀愛）給我們是厭倦，消沉，無可諱言的是生命相互的戕害了。是怎樣可怕呵，當我們例須接吻或性交，一種生理的不得不已，習惯的不得不已，强制我們的愛情來完成，在歡愉的背後，愛是受了貶骨的寒噤而戰慄了。我問我自已：「愛是你全部人生意義嗎？」這中間，生活的鞭策，生命的要求，尤其時代性的批判，我理智了。</p>
<p>我完全了解我的生命，和兩性關係上的性愛，在一切不屬於我自已的社會的這種社會諸關係中，我應該以一種甚麽熊度來解决我的婚姻問題。</p>
<p>男子們幾乎很少例外不爲土封建餘的氣氛所範圍。如果，他僅以英雄的氣槪，壯美的風姿爲我所愛戀，那無疑的，我只是得到單純的性的慾望之滿足的結果，伴隨在我們歡樂後面的是幻滅。這，戀愛神聖，停滞於個人圓中的生活，已給過我們不少的敎訓了，無論在社會在自已的精神與時間，却不應視婚姻爲兒戲的吗。那我們將任其陷在那幻滅的愛裹嗎？假如我所愛戀的，他正是我前進的程途上的絆石，那我們就止步不再前進了嗎？踼開這絆石？那我們漫漫的長途，將何勝其頪於這種私的拖累？獨身嗎？爲甚麽要戕殺我生理的自然呢？所以，對於他之理解社會，逼視社會，生活於社會，和相互的了解，相互的諧和，是必須的條件。</p>
<p>在這結合上，簡直爲兒戯於戀愛的人們所想不到，那相互的理解的批判，辯證底的發展的新力量，促進人類生活之高度的開展，是如何顯示着一種嶄新的精神。這力量使我們緊張的生活，我們雙方的心中，誠恐自已的不努力或懈怠，遭受時方遺棄爲不幸。因爲，雙方的愛戀都建築在學問與事業的相互的努力上；這努力，不僅是愛的相互的吸引的動力，而愛，却正是伴隨着彼此的精神之向上，才能獲得新生的力量；所以，對方的遺棄，是表徵着我的生活的墮落，到是這不幸結果的重要原因；這是包含着社會性的意義，誰敢冒此不諱，甘居於下墜的鄙視呢。因此，在我們的性關係上，没有那死板的應付與玩弄；無論是久别之後，或長期間的同棲，每一次的擁抱，從生命之源泉中，顫動着如同初戀時分的熱愛陶醉我們。在這裹，不斷的新生的力量，是我們緊相結合的錬，如果一時對某人從心湧出着戀愛之情，我們必彼此坦白的説出正確的批判：「你錯誤了！」或者説：「眞確的，她（或他、的樂點是値得你愛戀的！」我們認識清楚，任何手段範住對方，對於精神與愛都是制命的摧殘，也就是自已的毁滅。起源於佔有的妬嫉，在我們的關係上，漸被遺忘！生活的正視與檢討，潑息了我或他心中的某種燃燒的火熖，我們更親密的連鎖起來。</p>
<p>這是蓋無疑問的，兩性關係是以事業爲中心而向前創造的，所以，彼此問有或種原因引發起了裂痕，不是我有了摧毀「愛」的因素，便是他墮落。這，在我們精神向上的推動力不能有作用時，還用得着维持這腐朽關係嗎？根本，一個向上，一個消沉，這不用説這消沉的給與向上的·是一種可怕的障害；「愛」憑着甚麽會不死寂呢？這關係還有甚麽依據？自然只有分離。</p>
<p>奮鬥就是生活！兩性關係必須奮鬥底的來開展牠的前途！</p>

<p>北國的冬天像刀子一樣。</p>
<p>没有風，然而冷氣依然催人們縮了𩓐子，刺蝟似的團躱着，人心裹都存着一個預兆：快下雪了。</p>
<p>傍晚，卸下了一身重負般拍掉身上的灰塵，彎彎曲曲繞着小道回住處來，漫飄着的雪花加急了人們的步履，鼻子尖疼着。</p>
<p>走過路邊那個矮牆時我楞住了，門前圍着那麽多的人，後面的擠着前面的，這裹面夾雜着孩子們的嚷嚷，聞到一些纸錢味，我明白這裹面一定有新停止了呼吸的人了。</p>
<p>「老牟眞狠心，甩下三個孩子不管，就顧着跟了孩子的爹死去···」</p>
<p>「也是爲了錢哩！當家的（註：北平人稱丈夫呌當家的。）活着究竟還能貼補家裹一點，現在倒要弄一身債務！」我認出來這是女縫工林德家的，她緊皺眉又接下去：「老牟也不知吊了多久，哎，盆裹還有一堆按攬來的衣裳没洗呢。」</p>
<p>聽見是洗衣裳的女人，我驀地明白起來，這胡同裹不會有多少洗衣婦的，一定就是常到我屋主人處邓被單的那個，有時候她還向我要，我伸出一雙粗壯的胳膊和那女人開玩笑，説我比她還有力氣。原也是，這女人的乾瘦是不會使人相信她每天能伏在綠缸盆前五六點鐘的，只有眼角處看得出她才三十多歲。</p>
<p>我拍一下林德家的户膀：</p>
<p>「嘿，怎麽了，這麽擠勁兒！」</p>
<p>女人把踮着的脚趾放下來，吃驚地：</p>
<p>「你丨丨你這丫頭眞嚇人！來來，瞧瞧老牟去，罰罰你，坑上還硬挺着老牟的當家的啦！」</p>
<p>這下子林德家的使出了吃奶勁兒來，我們勝利地堵在門口，也不知是眞的擠不進去，還是林德家的自已也膽怯了。</p>
<p>人們的視綫倒似乎從坑上的死人移到了坐在長凳上抺涙的那差一點也死了的活人，忘了寒冷敞着的𩓐子上深深勒着紫紅的印，那就是一個高個兒脹着一額青筋詈駡的理由了，他住在同胡同的較高的瓦房裹，老牟租的房是他的，這時咒駡還在接續下去：</p>
<p>「没聽説過的，當家的死了不説趕快安排喪事，却死心眼兒地上吊，咱這屋子明兒個還打算租出去不！」下雪天他却抺着汗，「娘兒們也該有個主意呀！」</p>
<p>三個都不過桌子高的孩子獃獃的瞅着坑上的死了的爹和抽噎着的母親，女人把個頂小的攬在懷裹，兩隻小眼睛死盯着她𩓐子裹的紫紅的深痕，像是憐惜，又像是畏戄。</p>
<p>女人又放聲器起來，指着坑上的一個：</p>
<p>「連塊蘆蓆也没錢買啊，他一副糖担子也賣不出幾塊錢，那輩子下土去！······」</p>
<p>「你也死了才乾脆嗎？想咋人家的棺材！」男的透了口氣：「想好兒借點錢來埋掉了事，趁早不要租我的房子了」。</p>
<p>大夥兒勸着，男的氣哼哼地出去了。女人收住淚，和伙伴們商量着借個十來塊錢來把死的埋掉。慢慢由自已多作點活來還債。</p>
<p>人漸漸散了開來，出來。零花已積在地上不溶化，陰森統治住了世界。跨出門，還隠約聽得徵弱嘆息。</p>
<p>「死也没有自由哇！」</p>
<p>日子像飛，算起來離下雪那天已有十多天，深夜，當我走過一堆歇着的車夫們面前時，瞧見了那欲死不得的女人，她在替車夫們張羅着倒熱茶，一根扁担横在地下，一頭是一籃粗碗，一頭是一隻比酒醰子小點的茶壺。</p>
<p>「老牟！我聲音裹騰躍躇着喜悦。」</p>

<h3 id="c287">劍川婆 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>「有錢買隻騾子拖，</p>
<p>不如討個劍川婆。」</p>
<p>這是劍川附近的人們所唱的俗語，女人不如騾子，倒也是頗不可多見的吧。</p>
<p>劍川縣是在雲南，約莫離大理有百數十里。那兒也是一個偏僻的地方，女人家是非常特異於其他地方的。如果上海的女人每餐喫二碗飯，那她們起碼就須來個十碗左右。她們的脚説是像一隻小輪船，那麽大，這雖是過火；但却也可見她們的天足是大於小脚多多吧！</p>
<p>她們身體的高大和强健不必詳細的以分寸論她。我們平常抬棺材的，起碼是要兩個人，但劍川女人一隻手可以夾一具棺材，這是多麽驚人呢！中國歷史上的許多力士英雄，該是實在有那樣高大的身材吧。</p>
<p>她們日常生活的勤苦和給看作牛馬般的情形，就舉個例來説。這兒還是存着九分的封建意味，女人家最喜歡做秀才娘。現在秀才取消了，上其他大城市去考洋學堂也是一樣光榮。女人們逢着嫁到一個讀書人時，那她們的丈夫一定不是去雇或者買隻騾子，把自已和行李拖過高山峻嶺去上學；而是女人把丈夫抬放坐在兩肩，行李還要裝掛在身上。一隻騾子所能拖得動的東西，一個劍川婆總是有力可以背負的。這種呌人難於置信的事情，是這樣不虚的存在着。身上負背這許多重量，越過十數日的高山峻嶺，是大有毫無難色之槪。那眞活像畜生給男人們當牛馬。好好的常牛馬還不够呢！他們有兩句俗語，來恥笑女人的下賤：</p>
<p>『有錢買隻騾子拖，</p>
<p>不如討個劍川婆！』</p>
<p>劍川婆不如騾子，是很明白的事情吧。</p>
<p>這當不是劍川女人生成的妈隷身，乃是劍川的經濟地理的特殊環境所造成。和因爲是在舊社會的殘毒還蔓延着的時代，女人給看做牛馬，看做妈隸，當作械機的使用般，還是到處多是，特别我們老大文明的中國，這一類的風俗習惯，常常足使人聽了作嘔。</p>
<p>劍川婆這種强健與高大的身體和刻苦耐勞的勞動，並不是恥辱和卑鄙。反之，正是婦女的正確的生路，健康美和能勞動才是現代女性所最需要的。我們不該恥笑劍川婆的脚活像一隻小輪船，只是應注意到取消：</p>
<p>『有錢買隻縲子拖，</p>
<p>不如討個劍川婆。』</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>▲利用電話　　▲恭祝年釐</p>
<p>歲聿云暮，轉瞬耶誕節届，而新年亦將開始。在斯時期，社會人士，酬酢往來，更較平時爲尤親切：禮物饒赠，斯一端也，賀柬互傅，亦屬一法；但異地相思，年頭爲甚，每逢佳節，倍覺寄懷，慰之維何，曰維電報。</p>
<p>電報在耶誕節前後，藉消息之互傅，通彼此之情愫，可謂適用之至。回憶農時電報收費，並無所謂賀年電報與尋常電報之分，迨後通商巨埠，西人旅居日繁，新年拍電，遞往海外，祝賀之誠，瞬息可逹，因此耶誕與賀年電報，遂爲注意社交者所不可少。</p>
<p>其實賀年電報，亦不過交際電報之一種，國人熱心交際，侈談交際，交部利用此點，已有交際電廉價之規定。賀耶誕與賀年，在交際上最爲重要，價目亦同樣减廉，摩登士女，不可不注意及之也。</p>
<p>考賀年電報，最發逹時期，乃在民十以後，尤以通商大埠，數最最多。電局人員，率於歲尾年頭，異常忙碌。各界逢斯新年佳節，每作狂歡，報務增進，實爲一年之冠。時勢推邅，而有交際電之增設，不管表示一種慶祝和平統一之好現象也。</p>
<h3 id="c290">「和平」「合作」「統一」與電信 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>五中全會行將開幕之時，中央爲精誠團結起見，特派孫科王寵惠兩氏南行與西南諸委共商國是，閉其結果，異常圓滿，并决定「和平」「合作」與「統一」三種原則云云。是則數年來中央與粤港意見，完全化除，從此和衷共濟，通力合作，黨國大基，於茲卜定。「一言興邦」，孫王兩氏此行有之矣。</p>
<p>夫國人希望「和平」「合作」與「統一」，因極普遍。而交通事業之需要「和平」「合作」與「統一」，尤爲迫切。卽以電信言之，非上項三種原則具備，决無整理與擴充之可言也。蓋電信爲一國之神經系統，苟一地不和平或一省不合作，影響及於整個計劃，甚至將已有之原來建設，全然摧毁。試觀每次戰爭發生之時，電信事業，首當其衝，如軍電之擁擠也，商電之被壓也，局長之擅委也，電欵之提盡也，電綫之覇佔也，電桿之割斷也，電員之借用也，種種誅求壓迫情事，前在軍閥時代，罄竹難書，國民政府統治之下，此風固已稍殺，然以電信與軍事關係異常密切，每逢戰事發生，無不受其支配之理。此就電信本身而言之也。若夫兩軍相遇，商旅絶塗，市廛成墟，農村破産，在此時期，試問有何電信營業之可言，故戰爭對於電信間接之損失，又不可以道里計也。自國難以還，當局力持和平統一主義，對内政策，相忍爲國，除剿匪外，决不以兵戎相見，故來年電信事業日有進步，胥受和平之賜，抑又明也。</p>
<p>至於合作一事，尤爲電信所需要。良以中國幅圓之廣大，人口之衆多，經濟之枯窘，人才之缺乏，欲建設有綫無綫及電話綱，滿布全國，决非中央一時財力所及。而電路之保護，人力之資助，材料之運輸，尤非藉地方政府與民衆之助不爲功。故交通部對於民營市内電話，訂有監督條例，許其設置並依法而監督之。交通部對於省辦長途電話，亦經呈准行政院　訂定交通部委託省政府代辦長途電話原則，許其分道揚鑣，功效一致，此於整個統系之中，寓分功合作之意，前者係法理問題，後者係事實問題，一則免抵觸中央所規定之權益，二則爲各省謀各個之發展。故交通部於今年六月間委託浙省政府代辦長途電話，於七月間進行部辦長途電話與商辦市内電話之聯絡，皆誠意合作之表現也。</p>
<p>旣能和平相與，又能誠意合作，電政本身，漸入正軌，轉而促進政治上之統一，實意中事。數年來粤桂等省電政，因政治關係，與中央頗多隔閡，自電政會議舉行以後，粤桂等省出席人員，瞭然於中央之電信政策與其誠意合作意旨，歸而轉逹粤桂等省當局，故關於電政意見，日趨融洽，國際報費，尤能按時繳解，對外通信，已樹統一之先聲，今更因政治之統一，則電政統一問題，當迎刃而解矣。</p>
<p>當交通部舉行電政會議之時，作者曾舉該會統一精神合作精神，以告國人。蓋蓋電政事業，爲國際上通訊之工具，决不容有不統一不合作情事發現，否則必貽「無組織」「非現代國家」之譏。但不幸偶然有此現象者，非電政本身之咎，實受國内政治環境之反映。今者五中全會舉行會議於首都，决大疑，立大計，對内政策，必歸統一，和平始能建設，合作然後成功。凡百事業，皆基於此，豈祇電信而已哉？</p>
<h3 id="c291">電信事業之整理與發展 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>電信是人們通信的利器。因爲科學的進步一日千里，自從有綫電報電話發明以來，相隔不到幾十年，又有無綫電報電話的發明。現在人們利用電流傳遞消息的工具，有有綫電報電話和無綫電報電話，機械日見精良，設備益臻完善。歐美各國電信事業的長足進展眞是方興未艾。現在我來談談我國電信事業的整理和發展。</p>
<p>㈠有綫電報　我國有綫電報因爲時局多故，綫路常遭意外摧殘，並且電政經濟非常困難，所以一時很難建設，不過有綫電報旣已具有相當規模，豈能任其遭受摧殘，不去設法整理麽？如果説因爲有了無綫電，有綫電應當天演淘汰，可以完全廢棄不用，那是不合理的話。假使一千多處的電報局一旦完全停閉了，要去設立一千多處的無綫電臺來代替，不但不合經濟原則，恐怕也非事實所許吧！可見有綫電報尙有整理的必要。最近聽説電政當局對於有綫電很盡力去整理，設備方面如修理綫路及購置最新機器，以期正確迅速。業務方面如收費務使低廉，通都大邑電報收發處及車站郵電代理處的增設，種種設施都爲推廣業務便利民衆着想，總算差强人意的事！</p>
<p>㈡無綫電報　我國幅員廣大，邊遠各省交通不便，建設有綫電報確有相當因難。無綫電因爲無須架設綫路，故邊遠省區，雖有崇山峻嶺之隔，設置無綫電臺並無絲毫困難。無綫電對於邊遠通信，旣有相當功效，嗣後應竭力設法添設邊遠電臺，不但邊遠民衆，得到通信便利，對於國防方面也有莫大效能。其次，我國國際電信交通，向來依頼外商水綫公司承轉，處處不免受其梏桎。自從國際電臺創設以來，國際通訊方面，當然收到相當效果，挽回外溢利權，年遠三百萬元以上。足見無綫電報對於邊遠省區，及國際方面，實有儘量發展的必要。</p>
<p>㈢有綫電話　有綫電話有長途電話及市内電話之别，長途電話分爲部辦省辦兩種，市内電話也有部辦商辦兩種。近來各省省辦長途電話發展頗速，不免影響電報營業。但是電報電話旣同爲通信利器。當然不能説有了電報，就不必再有長途電話。惟爲便利民衆及適合經濟原則起見，省辦長途電話似不必與部辦長途電話綫路架設並行綫，以免互相競爭，兩敗俱傷。記得汪院長在交通部電政會議開幕訓詞中曾經説過國營事業要通力合作，那末省辦長途電話，應該先就未有部辦長途電話各處盡量發展，聯絡通話，並與部辦長途電話及電報局臺設法接轉報話，使民衆可以得到眞眞通信的便利。</p>
<p>關於市内電話，如上海租界電話收回問題，各局機器改良問題，都是急切需要之圖，至電話業務方面，尤須注意改革陋規，取締欠費，此外接綫生對於用户應和平有禮，接綫務求敏捷，俾使用户滿意，業務得以發展</p>
<p>㈣廣播無綫電臺　近年以來，上海和其他通都大邑的民衆對於裝置無綫電收音機很感興趣。因此上海一隅的民營廣播電臺也就適應需要，日見增多，其中不免有少數廣播電臺貪圖小利和外埠商行私自接洽，利用無綫電報告商業行情，曾經被國際電信局的稽察電臺查獲，加以取缔。所以無綫電話的發展，雖然是一種良好現象，但是也不能不有相當的制裁。假使廣播電臺可以任其兼營報告商業行情，那是和國營電報局臺的業務委有妨礙，希望各地電報局臺的主管人員注意到這一點，也許和業務的發展有些關係呢。</p>
<p>最後，我國電報局臺向來太不注重宣傳，各種報紙和雜誌上很少看見電報局臺刋登的業務廣告，以致一般人對於電報的印象很爲薄弱，這也是電報營業不能發逹的一個原因。英國郵政總局每年化了一筆鉅欵，印刷了好多精美的小册子或廣告，去宣傳有無綫電報電話和航空郵遞郵政儲金，因此郵電事業在英國很爲發逹。「電報商業化」，是年來電政當局的主張，廣告是商業上宣傳的利器，這業務廣告一項，必須多多注意，總能有相當的收籆。希望電政當局對於電信方面，尤其是國際電信方面，要加倍的宣傳，使人人明瞭國際電臺，爲提倡國貨挽回利權的利器，那末電信前途發展，未可限量呵！</p>
<h3 id="c292">電話的話（二） <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 寄然</p>
<p>余於本刋二十二期中篇中，述共電式電話自有其優點，故自動式興，而共電式仍不受淘汰。所謂共電式之優點，苟管理良善，接綫迅捷，則與自動電話，初無軒輊，而共電式需用接綫人員，此接綫人員有時所能爲公衆服務，亦每爲有用司機祇藉機械自動更多利益，此亦共電式得人稱許之一種原因也。</p>
<p>在民國十六年中，上海南市電話局，有一事恒爲人樂道。時在秋間，某夜余忘之矣。南市某家有孩患急疾者，用電話呼喚市内各醫，以逾夜半，無有應者。此時滬局之電話爲共電式，旣呼醫無術，因告司機人，謂有無辦法，能延租界醫生來？問所欲醫生？則以某某及某某等擇一均可。司機人員以時在午夜，接綫事閒，乃陸續爲之代喚，結果居然醫生登門，孩疾有救。越數天該家父母，特親往話局，詢明當時値機人員，面謝並再登報誌謝焉。</p>
<p>電話而自動，卽無司機之接綫，此種偶然事件之發生，乃得力於司機。司機不必要，但有時司機竟能助用户，使用户充分滿意。下列各節，譯自西方雜誌，亦信確有證也！</p>
<p>火災發生，用户往往心慌意亂，撥盤轉動號碼，十九均易錯誤，致所呼喚之救火會或警署，或保險公司，一時不能得到。若用共電式機，則一舉聽筒，呼以「火」字，司機無有不爲之急轉者，實際上較自動電證省事不少。此爲若干美國用户經騐之談，亦所以推許共電式話機者。</p>
<p>盗賊之事，在美國大都會，亦不免發生。爲防患起見，各大公司重要電話，皆由地下引入，且多另裝一秘密電話，以備意外。此種秘密電話，亦以共電式爲宜，蓋一遇盗刦，祇須話機在手，輕對司機生説一「盗」字，不必滴搭轉盤，洩漏聲息也。</p>
<p>其餘爲社會公益事。爲私人緊急事，得司機在電話上服務，比較用自動電話，直接呼喚，有時利益更多，正未可一槪抺煞云。（完）</p>

<p>金煥燕未請登記私裝收音機</p>
<p>經天津電臺拘送法院判處罰金</p>
<p>有金煥燕者，（一名金煥然，又名金召峙）前曾服務無綫電界，略具電學智識，近與人開設天津信義銀號，經營金業。於去年十一月二十九日先後購買無綫電收音機兩架，私自按設家内（天津英租界公益里二十九號）以之收聽私設電臺所發金價行市，供給銀號之用，事被天津無綫電臺於本月二日間設法偵知，報由河北省省會公安局偕同英工部局前往搜查，當塲破獲，人證一併轉解天津地方法院審辦。經該法院檢察處依法起訴，迭經審訴之後，結果金煥燕終因未曾聲請登記私設收音機，有違電信條例第三條規定之故，依照該條例第二十一條之規，被判處罰鍰一千二百元。</p>
<p>查廣播無綫電收音機登記暫行辦法早經交通部明令公布，凡裝置收音機者均應照章向各處交通部管轄之無綫電臺聲請登記，取得登記證，方爲合法。該項登記辦法第九條並規定：「裝户如自其收音機接得任何無綫電信，除廣播無綫電外，皆應保守秘密。」今該金煥燕旣未聲請登記，又復收聽遞法私設電臺所發出之金價行市，藉以牟利，顯係違犯電信條例第三條及收音機登記暫行辦法第九條之規定，今被判處罰金一千二百元，實屬咎由自取，罪有應得，惟此案興前永立銀號等私設電臺一案，情節又有不同：良以金煥燕所裝置僅係收音機兩架，並無發報機，不能擾亂他人所發之電信，本身亦不能發報，故對於國電信營業，損害尙小，權衡輕重，自不能與永立銀號案相提並論，同以盗竊論罪。</p>
<p>竊吾人重有感焉：夫廣播無綫電收音機之管理，各國均有條例規定，且須酌收登記費用，人民之裝收音機者，莫不信守法令，遵照登記手續登記，深足表示其爲有秩序有組織之國家。獨我國則不然，人民對於國家法令往往漠視，卽以收音機登記一事覘之，大足證明吾人法律觀念之淺薄。據調查所知，國人之裝有收音機者，約數十萬户，而遵令聲請登記者則殊寥寥，此數十萬收音機裝户大抵爲生活較裕之智識階級，而竟亦藐視法令若斯，是誠吾國民缺乏公民訓練之表現，殊足暴露吾民族之劣根性，予外人以姗笑之資也，聞交通當局對於未曾登記之收音機，將定期責成所屬各電信機關從嚴取締，吾人深望各裝户迅速自動登記，母再因循泄沓，致受法律之制裁，而自贻伊戚也！</p>
<p>至收音機登記母須納費，手續亦極爲簡單，茲將登記手續摘錄於后，藉供各收音機裝户之參考：</p>
<p>㈠各裝户得向下列各處任何一處交通部所轄電信機關，領取登記聲請書，　　並應將聲請内所開各項詳細塡明：上海，南京，北平，天津，漢口，鄞縣，蕪湖電報局，福州，定海，厦門，崇明，啟東，汕頭，宜昌，南昌，長沙，廣州，青島，濟南，烟臺·巴縣，成都，萬縣，長安，（西安）鄞縣，貴陽，蘭州，</p>

<p>十月九日晚十一時一刻，離日内瓦，我們坐的三等車，原規定八人一間，但我同房間只有四人，故夜間尙能勉强睡臥，座位均是皮墊，較之我國二等車，有過無不及，十日晨八時一刻到巴黎，</p>
<p>在巴黎們耽擱的時間較久，曾去參觀法商無綫電製造廠，（簡稱ＳＦＲ）商辦無綫電台，（Ｒadio　France）及標準電氣公司之工程研究室，（Ｓsandard　Electric　Co　Research　Labovatory)</p>
<p>無綫電製造廠，規模不大，與建委會電機製造廠，不相上下，内分五金。及收發報機製造部，我們去參觀的時候，見到内面所做的機器，以飛機，及軍艦，商船上用的爲多，他們亦做廣播機，最大的電力有Ｉ２okw，還有空軍用的移動電台，收發報機分裝於二架汽車上，可以開往任何地點，與飛機通報，亦爲近代軍事交通之利器，</p>
<p>商用無綫電，一部國營，設在郵局内，其通報的地點，僅限於法屬殖民地，及一部歐洲的國家，如俄羅斯，波斯等處，其餘統歸商辦無綫電台收發，聞該台成立甚早，法政府當時曾許其有專利權，其收發報台，均設在城外，中央收發室，則在城内，發報機計有七架iokw短波發報機，其中僅中僅有一架係晶石式，其餘均爲主動振盪强力放大式（Ｍ．Ｏ．Ｐ．Ａ．）另有高週交流機之長波機八架，電力自５００kw至２５kw不等，短波機用與美國，中國，日本，及南美洲等處通報，至長波機則用與歐洲國家工作，收報台機器，大都陳舊，其中有一架較新式者，尙係購自馬可尼公司，中央收發室之電報，均用郵政總局轉來，無直接收報權，來報除電話傳送者外，亦交郵局代送，郵局與收發室間之傳遞，藉助於眞空管，故來去報均無躭擱，去報由郵局經眞空管傳送至收發室後，再經眞空管分别直接送至報員工作檯，通報的地點，共有十四處，其中東亞方面，爲上海，瀋陽，東京，三處，報務以倫敦爲最忙，每日來去在二千份左右，忙時用三機同時工作，倫敦巴黎間，所用之疲長爲２２００米逹至９００米逹，紐約電報，原亦甚忙，現以與水綫公司成立恊約，大部電報由水綫拍發，水綫公司之收發機，亦設在該室，同時與紐約工作，綜觀該台設備，除用眞空管傳遞來去電報外，其餘如機器之設備，及收發室之佈置，似均遠不及我國際電台，無足稱述也</p>
<p>標準電氣公司工程司研究室，設在巴黎，其總廠則在倫敦，太凡工程上如有新發明，先由研究室製成模型，再交偸敦總廠製造，研究室目前工作，在無綫電方面者，爲超短波（Ｕltra　Short　Wamve），及Ｍicro　Ray之試騐，及５０kw以上燈泡之製造，聞該試騐室已用Ｉ8cm與倫敦試通電報，試騐數月，結果甚佳，其法係將兩i８cm無綫電站，設在距離三十英哩左顺之處，再經陸綫分别接轉，至倫敦與巴黎，又該室新計劃一種無綫電打字機（Ｒadio　Jeleprinaer），每個英文字母，用七種不没波長，生成之點構成，我們見到的一只，是該公司所製之第二只模型，不久當可見諸實用，至發報燈泡，凡５０kw以下者，均在倫敦製造，其特别巨大者，則在巴黎，最大電力之燈泡可至３００kw云。</p>

<h3 id="e28">Ministry of Finance Investigates the Reasons for the Stagnant Sales of Domestic Wheat This Year <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jinpu Railway Bureau reported that a large amount of American wheat was transported to Shanghai, and the domestic wheat along the Jinpu Railway was stagnant. The Ministry of Finance replied that the import of foreign wheat from January to October this year was only 4 million dan, which is less than half of last year. The stagnant sales of domestic wheat are related to the silver price and have nothing to do with the light tax on foreign wheat. This year's floods and droughts are widespread, and the Shanghai Wheat Flour Factory Association even said that domestic wheat is not enough for use. It can be seen that there is no need to increase the tax on foreign wheat. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Shao Lizi said that the most important thing in developing the Northwest is transportation. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the construction projects in Shaanxi.

The Shanghai Bank is handling rural investment in Shaanxi, amounting to more than 2 million yuan, and the Bank of China has more than 100,000 yuan. The rest is the Shanghai Commercial Bank, which uses rural cooperatives as an intermediate transfer agency. Poor farmers rely on it for regulation. In the future, with the development of transportation, bankers will invest in commerce and prosper the Northwest market. The harvest in Shaanxi Province this year is still good. About 2,000 people from Henan and Anhui provinces have gone there to find food. The previous report that tens of thousands of people were mistaken.

<h3 id="e60">Blocking Foreign Rice and Utilizing Foreign Rice <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Ji</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, the import of foreign rice has increased annually. In 1933, it reached over 21.42 million shi, worth over 150 million yuan. This is more than a tenfold increase compared to the early Republic. This summer, the weather was extremely dry, and rainfall was scarce. Major rice-producing regions in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have all reported poor harvests. According to customs reports, foreign rice imports have already reached over 5 million shi in the first half of the year. If calculated for the entire year, the number will be even more considerable.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the increasing import of foreign rice. First, China's rice production is insufficient to meet domestic demand. According to recent statistics from the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the grain production in most provinces is disproportionate to the population. On average, the country is short about 30 million shi per year. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on large-scale imports of foreign rice to supplement the supply. Second, transportation is difficult in the inland provinces, making grain transportation difficult. Even in years of bumper harvests, there is the difficulty of not being able to transport the grain out. Therefore, major cities with particularly high rice demand purchase foreign rice to regulate the food supply due to convenient transportation with foreign countries. Third, heavy taxes and levies are levied in various regions, with provinces pursuing independent policies, hoarding goods for profit, and restricting grain sales across borders. Such unreasonable situations occur frequently. This is clearly sufficient to promote foreign rice imports. Fourth, neighboring countries, whenever they have a bumper rice harvest, implement dumping policies to maintain the stability of their domestic rice prices and the livelihoods of their farmers, treating our country as the tail end of their surplus grain. Due to these four reasons, there have been huge amounts of foreign rice imports every year, regardless of the harvests in domestic rice-producing regions. Sometimes, when domestic rice production is insufficient to meet demand, foreign rice takes advantage of the situation. Some people advocate replacing rice with coarse grains and improving rice production to resist foreign rice. As for the other reasons for foreign rice imports, efforts should be made to eliminate them. There is no doubt about that. Opening up transportation, abolishing harsh levies, cracking down on monopolies, prohibiting border restrictions on purchasing and selling grain, and assessing the situation to levy progressive import taxes on foreign rice are all essential measures. The official has already stated this clearly. However, I feel that there is one more thing that should be promoted, which is to hope that the government will build and fill granaries in various places as soon as possible. There are many benefits to this measure: 1. Calming people's hearts and suppressing grain prices. 2. Domestic rice is often in the hands of those who hoard goods for profit, waiting for a good price before selling. If the government stores a large amount of grain, these people will feel that it is difficult to monopolize the market. Even if they have rice in hand, they will inevitably be eager to sell it. The supply of domestic rice can be increased. 3. Border restrictions on purchasing and selling grain in various places are only to prevent local food shortages. If the government has a large amount of grain stored, it can be fearless and will not repeat the malpractice of provinces pursuing independent policies. 4. In the event of a food shortage, even if unscrupulous merchants try to take advantage of the situation, monopolize and control the market, they will have no skills to use. 5. Storing grain to prevent famine is a clear instruction from ancient times. The world is changing rapidly, and everyone is in danger. This measure is especially not to be neglected.</p>
<p>Secondly, what I want to discuss is how to fill the granaries in various places. I believe that today, if the government wants to purchase rice for storage, it should mainly purchase from overseas Chinese rice merchants in Southeast Asia. This is because, firstly, it will not affect domestic rice prices, and secondly, it can also subsidize the economy of overseas Chinese. Conversely, if purchases are made domestically, it is questionable whether there will be surplus grain to supply. Even if large-scale purchases can be made, grain prices will inevitably rise accordingly, which should also be considered. However, some may say that the method of purchasing rice from Southeast Asia inevitably has two drawbacks: first, provinces with bumper harvests domestically will be affected, causing grain prices to fall and harming farmers; second, purchasing foreign rice still inevitably leads to the outflow of profits, which seems to contradict what I said earlier. I don't think these are enough to cause confusion. This kind of foreign rice is purchased by the government, not by individuals, and it is all stored and not sold unless there is a food shortage or other unavoidable situation. How can it seize the normal sales channels of domestic rice? Moreover, if domestic rice prices can be lower than foreign rice, there is no harm in purchasing it first after large-scale purchases, as it will not cause prices to rise. Unfortunately, after the drought, there may not be a large surplus of rice in the country that can be purchased and stored. At a time when domestic rice prices are too high, the government also needs to purchase foreign rice to equalize prices. As for the outflow of profits, it is unavoidable. However, since the purchase is from overseas Chinese merchants, it cannot be said to be a complete outflow. Moreover, in general, it is better than domestic rice being hoarded by private individuals, border restrictions on purchasing and selling grain in various places, and purchasing rice from foreign countries.</p>

<p>Three-Nation Representatives Hold Outing in the Countryside for Camaraderie</p>
<p>(London) At the London Naval Talks, the British, American, and Japanese representatives, Simon, Davis, Standley, and Matsudaira, left London at 9:00 AM this morning and played golf at the Walden golf course at 10:00 AM, returning only in the evening. Although the naval talks are on the verge of collapse, the three-nation representatives are still playing together, showing friendship and gathering for photographs. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Whether the naval talks among Britain, the United States, and Japan can continue depends entirely on whether Japan is willing to submit its shipbuilding program. If Japan is willing to submit it, future talks will be based on the part of the British compromise proposal that involves each country announcing its naval needs. It is heard that Britain has indicated its willingness to publish Britain's shipbuilding program for the next five years. However, the United States is currently unwilling to discuss Britain's proposal or shipbuilding program. It is generally believed that the United States may be willing to discuss shipbuilding programs after the Washington Treaty is abolished. If Japan's reply is positive, the talks will likely be postponed to allow the US representatives to return home to consult with their government in order to discuss the shipbuilding program. The Japanese representatives have also asked the Tokyo government whether they can continue the talks without US representatives. At the same time, the three-nation representatives are scheduled to meet together today. This is the first time since the start of the discussions. The representatives will mix business with pleasure, as they will be playing golf between discussions on substantive and quantitative restrictions. British Foreign Secretary Simon, US Chief Representative Davis, and his main assistant Standley, and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira are all scheduled to attend today's meeting. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The plan of Naval Minister Chatfield to reach a compromise on the shipbuilding plans of the various countries failed due to the opposition of the United States and Japan. Even the preparations to avoid a breakdown of the consultations were ineffective. The minister previously internally indicated to Plenipotentiary Yamamoto the British shipbuilding plan for the five years after the expiration of the treaty in 1937 and requested Japan to make the same internal indication. Plenipotentiary Yamamoto did not answer immediately, saying that he would answer after listening to the intentions of the United States. Plenipotentiary Yamamoto then asked US Plenipotentiary Standley whether he intended to make it public. Standley replied that the United States considered its shipbuilding plan to be a domestic issue within the limits of the treaty, so there was no need to make it public. Therefore, Japan also decided to refuse to make it public. (14th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e63">US and Japanese Representatives Meet, Differences Become Increasingly Obvious, Meeting Ends Without Reaching Substance <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(London) Representative Yamamoto met with US Representative Standley at noon on the 14th, expressing Japan's willingness to make efforts to negotiate for the purpose of concluding a new agreement and proposing that the UK, US and Japan clearly decide the date for reopening the preparatory meeting next year. Yamamoto also strongly argued that the United States' reason for officially suspending the preparatory meeting because of Japan's abrogation of the treaty was inappropriate and demanded reflection. However, Standley did not give a clear answer, only stating that unless Japan withdrew its demand for equal power, the date for reopening the preparatory meeting could not be decided. Yamamoto left after an hour without reaching substance. (14th Nichi-Ren Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) US newspapers' London correspondents reported that Japanese naval representative Yamamoto had secretly visited US Naval Chief of Staff Standley and asked him not to suspend the talks when Japan announced the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty. Standley rejected this, saying that Japan should bear the responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Naval negotiator Yamamoto, Chief Specialist of Japan, and Standley, US Naval Chief of Staff, held talks this afternoon, lasting only a short time. It seems that the talks were only about the possibility of concluding a three-nation agreement on the mutual notification of naval shipbuilding programs. The mutual notification of shipbuilding programs and other agreement methods were originally proposed by the UK. The Japanese delegation is awaiting a reply from the Tokyo government. However, the general impression is that Yamamoto wanted to first understand the US attitude towards this kind of proposal before receiving official instructions from Tokyo. According to responsible sources, Standley only stated to Yamamoto during this afternoon's talks that the US representatives had not yet paid attention to the issue of concluding an agreement on the mutual notification of naval shipbuilding programs. People close to US Chief Representative Davis stated that in the current situation, the US government could not accept the conclusion of a treaty limited to the mutual notification of shipbuilding programs. As for the Japanese representatives, they were hesitant and inconsistent on this secondary issue. Generally speaking, diplomatic officials in Japan principally support this method to avoid the breakdown of naval talks and are prepared to make some sacrifices to achieve a minimal three-nation agreement. This would at least save the future of the negotiations. On the other hand, people in the Japanese Navy believe that the agreement on the mutual notification of shipbuilding programs must simultaneously determine the maximum limit of total tonnage or the maximum limit of tonnage by warship type based on common principles. Japan is unwilling to take a path of concession before ensuring equal naval rights, even if it is only a formal concession. Therefore, after Yamamoto and Standley held talks this afternoon, the issue of establishing an agreement on the mutual notification of shipbuilding programs had greatly lost its sharpness. What the representatives are scheming for is no longer how to make the negotiations produce results, but how to evade responsibility for the failure of the negotiations. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e64">New British-Japanese Compromise Plan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign and Naval Ministries Confer on Countermeasures</p>
<p>(London) The content of the issues concerning the unilateral matters agreed upon by Japanese Representative Yamamoto and British Representative Chatfield is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1. The content of the declaration is freely chosen by each country and is not subject to any international constraints. 2. Clarify future shipbuilding plans, explaining the qualitative and quantitative content of various warships. 3. Limit the maximum naval power of the UK and US. Japan will announce content approaching the naval power of the UK and US each time. 4. A term of five years. (14th Nichi-Ren Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because it is necessary to decide Japan's attitude as soon as possible regarding the compromise plan already established between the British and Japanese representatives, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a joint conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy at 7:00 PM on the 14th to review countermeasures, which adjourned at 10:00 PM. The conference decided on the following fundamental principles for Japan, and a telegram was immediately sent to the delegation in the UK:</p>
<p>1. Request recognition of the Japanese government's principle of equal naval armament. 2. If this principle is recognized, set the maximum limit for each country's holdings, and Japan intends to take a compromising attitude with the UK and US as before regarding the year to reach that state. 3. Japan will submit the Japanese government's plan and specific figures after reopening the preparatory talks next year. (15th Nichi-Ren Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The reason for the delay in the government's return telegram to Ambassador Matsudaira is that the British private plan concerns the setting of a maximum limit for the common holdings. The British side used the premise of maintaining the existing force of 1.2 million tons, but because it feared exceeding 1.2 million tons at a certain period when reaching equality, it devised various methods based on the particularity of various ship types from a technical perspective to solve the problem to accommodate Japan's substantive equality. Therefore, the Navy intends to fully review its content and then decide on the best specific method. Also, although the discussion object will be the new agreed matter in the future, with the British private plan as the basis, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain the approval of the United States. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that even if it is only between the UK and Japan, it is determined to establish an agreed matter in some form that allows for the reopening of talks. Therefore, the Navy will immediately send a telegram to Ambassador Matsudaira when it decides on the final plan, and the return telegram is expected to be sent within the next week.

<p>Britain Has a Necessary Advantage at Sea</p>
<p>(London) Lord Lloyd, Chairman of the British Navy Association and former High Commissioner to Egypt, recently sent a letter to The Times, expressing his views on naval issues. He stated that Britain must have maritime superiority in order to achieve security and equality. Recently, people have generally said that the Washington Naval Treaty is recognized by both the United States and Britain as enabling each signatory to obtain security and equality. This statement is actually inappropriate. What is "security" if not the elimination of fear? However, if the United States were to be attacked at sea, what would it fear? The United States is a large country with abundant resources and a vast land, and it is self-sufficient in major commodities. The foreign trade of the United States is not fundamentally related to its continued survival. Therefore, if the United States were attacked at sea, it would not interrupt the survival and happiness of its people. As for Britain, the situation is completely reversed. Britain's domestic production is not self-sufficient, and Britain's continued survival depends entirely on the free flow of overseas trade. Britain's autonomous territories and dependencies are thousands of miles away from the mainland. If the autonomous territories and dependencies are attacked by the enemy, Britain must first obtain the safety of passing through the ocean in order to safely transport troops and air forces to provide assistance. It can be seen that in order to achieve security and equality, the British navy must be superior to the American navy. (Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Le Journal criticizes the London Naval Talks, saying that the postponement of the conference is the only way to escape the predicament. It says, "Among the three countries participating in the London talks, the most difficult one is Britain. The equality ratio set by the Washington Treaty (both the United States and Britain are five) has already bound Britain and cannot be easily shaken off. Moreover, two major members of the British Empire, namely Canada and Australia, are also following the United States in international politics, so it is difficult for Britain to go against the United States. Conversely, Britain is also unwilling to lose its sympathy for Japan. If Britain and Japan are at odds, the people in the Asian territories of the British Empire will suffer adverse spiritual effects because of it." (Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>

Foreign Minister Hirota replied that this matter is currently being discussed with the "Manchukuo government," so the formal reply has been delayed until now. The Japanese government's attitude is still the same as the reply on August 3, with no changes. Next, the British ambassador asked Japan to respond to the implementation of Japan's kerosene industry law. The Foreign Minister promised to reply after consulting with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The British ambassador left at 6 o'clock. (Dentsu dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council Review Committee on the reform of the official system of agencies in Manchuria and other matters passed the original draft yesterday. The committee members and government officials exchanged questions and answers as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Is the new system permanent? (Okada answers) Judging from the current situation in "Manchukuo," there seems to be no other method at present except this system. However, when things change in the future, it is necessary to establish an appropriate system. Please understand that it is temporary. (Question) Is it necessary to incorporate the Director-General of the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, who is concurrently the Minister of the Army, into the reserve as the Director-General of the Civil Affairs Bureau? (Director of the Legislation Bureau Kanamori answers) It is not an obstacle for the Minister of the Army to concurrently serve as the Director-General. When the deputy director and below hold concurrent positions, it is necessary to incorporate them into the reserve. Therefore, in order to eliminate this inconvenience, an imperial edict will be formulated. (Question) What is the matter of the commander of the military police also serving as the director of police affairs? (Army Minister Hayashi answers) In view of the current situation, concurrent service is the most appropriate system. It is definitely not the transformation of military police into regular police. After the government committee withdrew at 5 p.m., the review committee deliberated and decided to pass it with a message of hope, that is, hoping that the government will obtain the harmony of the people and apply it appropriately when implementing this official system.

<p>Foolish Thief's Empty Joy</p>

<p>(New York) Yesterday, a thief broke into the office of the American Trust Company, and taking advantage of the opportunity when the accountant left his seat, grabbed $590,000 in banknotes placed behind the iron railing and quietly escaped without leaving a trace. However, this morning's newspaper regarded him as a foolish thief, because only 14 of the stolen banknotes were large denominations, including five each worth $100,000 and nine each worth $10,000. The serial numbers of the banknotes were known to the Trust Company, so after the banknotes disappeared, the police station was notified and radio broadcasts were sent to announce the numbers throughout the United States, Canada, and overseas ships. If the thief wants to use these banknotes, he will inevitably be trapped in the law, so although he got $590,000, it is actually useless to him. The newspaper therefore called him an unprecedented foolish thief. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>

It is still unknown whether the Abyssinian government will take other actions. The competent authorities believe that the second step will be decided after investigating the impact of the country's first note abroad. (Havas dispatch from the 15th) (Geneva) The government of Abyssinia, East Africa, today asked the Council of the League of Nations to pay attention to the seriousness of the situation on the border between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. The Abyssinian Foreign Minister announced Abyssinia's decision in a telegram today to submit the conflict between Italian conscripted soldiers and Abyssinia on December 7 to the League of Nations for handling. The telegram described the situation of the conflict, opposing Italian aggression. A Reuters dispatch from Rome today said that the Abyssinian envoy to Italy claimed that Abyssinia had repeatedly sent documents to the Italian government six days ago, advocating arbitration, but Italy had not yet responded. The current solution, except for war, is only to appeal to the League of Nations. Abyssinia does not want war. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini often claims to support peace. The Abyssinian government does not believe that he intends to start a war. The Italians have lived in Wuru on the border for five or six years, which is a fact, but it belongs to Abyssinia's land and cannot therefore be owned by the Italians.

He said that the relationship of international events is of great importance, and there is nothing more eye-catching to the general public of our country than today. We do not want to interfere in overseas disputes that are irrelevant to us. However, all events that occur overseas are often closely related to us. Moreover, what Britain is most concerned about is peace. The reason why the people of our country attach importance to international events lies in this. (Havas dispatch from the 14th) (London) Sir Austen Chamberlain, a veteran of the Conservative Party and former Foreign Secretary, recently gave a speech on wireless broadcasting, stating that the current prevailing psychology in Germany is the root cause of European unrest. Therefore, he strongly advocated that Britain should continue its policy of international cooperation in the European continent under the banner of Geneva. The speech stated, "The United States is about 3,000 miles away from Europe, not like our Britain, which is within the range of continental artillery shells. However, in the past, the European war broke out because the Austrian crown prince was assassinated, and the United States did not hesitate to participate in it. I dare to assert that if Britain abandons its inherent beliefs and abolishes its international treaties, war will be imminent. If all kinds of guarantees for the welfare and security of other ethnic groups are recklessly abandoned, the result of this policy may inevitably lead the whole world to unite and arm against our country. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill once said that the main reason for European unrest is due to the current psychological state of Germany, and his words are true. All our people regard this psychology as harmful. However, the whole world knows that the Hitler regime has taken deep root, and I do not expect the overthrow of this regime. What we hope is that the Hitler regime will continue to develop and change its course, becoming a new spirit of peace, on which the security and interests of all nations depend."

Chairman Nye of the Investigation Committee declined to comment on the statement that the investigation of international arms trade will focus on Morgan Company. A representative of Morgan Company said that the company is very concerned about the Senate investigation, but the company has not yet received an official investigation notice. The Associated Press learned that the Investigation Committee is paying particular attention to the relationship between the United States' declaration of war on Germany in 1917 and the British government's borrowing from Morgan Company. It is said that some members of the Investigation Committee attach great importance to the telegram sent by Pan-Chek, the American ambassador to Britain, to President Wilson on March 5, 1917, during the European War. The telegram stated, "The pressure of the crisis has made Morgan Company unable to provide for the governments of Britain and France, so the only way to save the situation is to declare war on Germany." This telegram was sent one month before the United States entered the war and refers to the British government's inability to pay Morgan Company's $40,000 debt at the time. According to President Roosevelt, the newly established War Interests Committee will be able to draft a plan that satisfies all parties to eliminate the interests of war.

<p>Singapore Nishimura, manager of Ishihara Sangyo Co., Ltd. and president of the Japanese Association of Singapore, died suddenly in the police station last Saturday. The remains were held on December 13. According to the government coroner, crystals of the "Mamushi" snake were found in his abdomen, which was the cause of death. Today, the coroner announced the verdict, stating that according to medical evidence and the time of various events, Nishimura took the deadly poison himself. However, Nishimura's side did not show any behavior indicating that he would commit suicide, and it is impossible to trace where the poison was purchased. Moreover, no traces related to his sudden death were found in his belongings. This poison may have been taken by himself, but there is insufficient evidence to determine how he took the poison.

<p>(Berlin) In the past few days, the secret police have been searching for people. It is now believed that this is the latest purge movement. This is probably the third time in recent months. It is said that it also involves important members of the National Socialist Party's Stormtroopers. This afternoon, the situation became more serious. When a certain Russian Countess was holding a tea party, a large number of National Socialist Party Black Guards suddenly covered up and arrested all the guests present. After interrogation, all but twenty-three were released. Among these twenty-three people, there was one important member of the National Socialist Party Guard, several leaders of the Black Guards, and two well-known German journalists. They are currently being interrogated by the headquarters of the secret police. Recently, the Black Guards have repeatedly searched night clubs in the western end of Berlin and detained everyone on the spot for interrogation. However, except for members of the National Socialist Party and the Guard Corps, the detention time is very short. It is widely believed that the National Socialist Party is now trying to eliminate bad elements in the party. (Reuters dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>Motor Open Car Carries Theater Troupe of 20 People</p>
<p>Fifteen Deaths and Injuries; Hitler's Car Is Safe</p>
<p>(Berlin) German leader Hitler attended the launching ceremony of the new ship "Scharnhorst" of the North German Company in White Rim and then took a fast train back to Beijing. That night, as the train approached a certain intersection in Hannover's Verdun, a motor open car carrying a theater troupe of 20 people suddenly passed through the railway car door in the fog and was hit by the fast train. With a crash, the open car was lifted into the air and then crashed to the ground, shattering. Of the 20 people, 13 died, 4 were seriously injured, and the remaining 3 suffered only minor injuries. No one was injured in the fast train. At that time, Hitler led the people to rescue the victims and helped to remove the debris on the track. He then comforted the injured one by one. Due to the long delay, he did not arrive in Berlin until 11 p.m. (Havas dispatch from the 14th) (Berlin) The official announcement regarding the train and bus collision in the Langley Terrace near Bremen Port was not released until noon yesterday. It only said that the accident was caused by the leader Hitler's special train crashing into the side of the bus. All the passengers on the special train were safe and sound. Interior Minister Frick announced that 15 people died and several were seriously injured in the accident. The cause of the crash was due to excessive fog. As for the train staff, they remained silent about the circumstances of the crash. (Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">War Debts Due Yesterday; All But Finland Have Stopped Paying <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Tomorrow is the due date for war debts of $154,729,976. Notes from France, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary have arrived today, unanimously stating that they are unable to pay the debts. Therefore, the default of the major debtor countries has become a foregone conclusion. The French Cabinet met on December 10. Former Prime Minister Herriot still advocated paying the debts owed to the United States, but was rejected due to a majority opposition. After the meeting, France issued a note of continued default. The UK notified the State Council on December 12 that it owes a total of $379,461,765. Except for Finland, which is willing to continue paying off its due debts, the total amount of defaults from other countries reached $647,966,459. Since June last year, European countries have given up hope of paying off their debts. According to the opinions of most current members of Congress, even if not a cent is obtained, the debts should not be canceled in order to clarify the moral responsibility of the debtor countries. Those who agree with this view claim that the US has already been generous in reducing the interest rates on debts, which is about 40% to 80% of the full amount they should pay.

The silver purchased from China this time was only worth $9,334, compared to $1,271,804 previously. Britain has replaced China as the main market for the United States to purchase. The silver imported from Britain this time was worth a total of $908,831, compared to a very small amount in the previous week. Mexico and Peru are also major silver producing countries, and silver has continued to be shipped. The amount imported from Mexico this time was $722,119, compared to $731,294 in the previous week. The amount imported from Peru this time was $192,320, compared to $179,920 previously. The amount purchased from Chile was $86,463. (Kokumin dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<p>As Important as the Discovery of the Tuberculosis Bacillus</p>
<p>(New York) Dr. Wood, Director of the Sarcoma Research Institute at Columbia University and editor-in-chief of the Sarcoma Journal, explained the root of sarcoma and said that the root of sarcoma is a compound, and its discovery is as important as Dr. Koch's discovery of the tuberculosis bacillus in 1882. This compound was invented by Dr. Cook of the London Sarcoma Research Institute. Cook is a British chemist who has been funded by the International Sarcoma Research Foundation, which is donated by Donald of Philadelphia to encourage domestic and foreign scholars to research sarcoma. According to Dr. Cook's theory, there may be some life-sustaining substances, but for other reasons, they undergo chemical reactions to become sarcoma roots. (Kokumin dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e89">German Pocket Battleship <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Another Method of Arms Race</p>
<p>Further Advancement of Scientific Competition</p>
<p>The preliminary naval talks in London involve only three naval powers: Great Britain, the United States, and Japan. People who pay attention to world issues and understand the situation in the Pacific can foresee what the future holds. Moreover, each country has its strengths. The British Navy occupies the throne of the seas, so its battleships are stronger than those of the United States and Japan. Although its cruisers under 10,000 tons are not as sophisticated as Japan's, they are numerous and have great organizational power. The United States excels in aircraft carriers. The "Lexington" is a converted battleship capable of carrying more than 80 aircraft, with a speed of 33 knots per hour, which is unmatched by Great Britain and Japan. Japan's submarines have almost the same hull design, and their attacking</p>
<p>effectiveness is more than twice as high as that of the German submarines used during the Great War.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the world's naval powers have been secretly competing, each showing their strengths. Germany is indeed a defeated country, but no one in the country has forgotten revenge or the task of revitalizing the nation. However, it is bound by the Treaty of Versailles, which allows the navy to have only 15,000 soldiers and warships only of the old "Deutschland" class, six ships. This is such a painful matter. Therefore, when Hitler raised his arms and called out, the people of Germany responded enthusiastically. Of course, Hitler was good at taking advantage of the environment and deeply understood the traditions of German history, but the strong and striving spirit of the German nation was also a key element.</p>
<p>The German Navy is severely restricted, unable to build warships or aircraft. So what should it do? In 1928, according to the treaty, it was allowed to build a new ship to replace the old "Deutschland." But there was still a restriction: the ship's tonnage could not exceed 10,000 tons, and the guns had to be below 11-inch caliber. The new "Deutschland," launched in 1931 and completed last year, is what is known as a pocket battleship.</p>
<p>Although this warship is small in tonnage and the guns are not large, it is the world's first solid and powerful warship. The first thing that deserves our attention is that each steel plate of the ship is joined without a single steel nail, but with the latest electrical welding method. This saves the weight of the hull for loading weapons, and the saved weight is 550 tons. The second is the installation of eight diesel engines, each with 7,100 horsepower, totaling 56,800 horsepower for the entire ship, which is light and agile. Third, it is equipped with 11-inch caliber guns. Needless to say, these guns are made of first-class steel from Germany's top steel factory, Krupp Steel. The gun barrels are much longer than ordinary 11-inch guns. Each shell weighs 670 pounds. Seeing that the gun barrel is longer than ordinary guns, we know that the initial velocity of the shell is very high. The range of the shell is 27,800 meters, and the elevation angle is 60 degrees. These three points are unprecedented achievements for modern warships of various powers.</p>
<p>Another point, which is rare in modern ordinary warships, is that the central part of the ship is covered with armored steel plates, and the upper deck is also divided into two layers, with air defense equipment. The ship's maximum speed is 26 knots. If it maintains a speed of 20 knots, its endurance can be 10,000 nautical miles. It can travel from Shanghai to Seattle and back without refueling. This is truly a pocket ship.</p>
<p>The ship is 606 feet long, 67.5 feet wide, and has a draft of 21.5 feet. It carries six 11-inch guns, eight 6-inch guns, four 3.4-inch anti-aircraft guns, and six 19.7-inch torpedoes. The sharpness of these weapons is no less than that of a 20,000-ton warship. No wonder the world is surprised, considering it a new record in the creation of weapons. The construction of this warship cost £3.75 million (if each pound is calculated at 16 yuan, it is worth 60 million Chinese silver dollars). In addition to the sister ship "Admiral Scheer," which can be completed this year, there are two more under construction. Germany's current finances are in a period of extreme difficulty, and foreign trade is not improving. However, it is still striving to move upward, insisting on equality of armaments on the one hand and striving to establish considerable armaments on the other, with science as its backing, giving full play to its organizational power. Although the future is not optimistic, its efforts to move upward are indeed worthy of our admiration. (Berlin, November 8)</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Japanese Threat Recently Felt by the Philippines <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Commissioner Advocates Continued U.S. Protection for 25 Years</p>
<p>— By Wen Chu</p>
<p>Japan has always advocated a policy of southward and northward expansion. The northward expansion is to invade the mainland by force, and the southward expansion is to invade the South Seas economically. Although the northward expansion has achieved a large part of its goals and is still in full swing, the southward expansion is not relaxed because of this. Therefore, the dumping of Japanese goods in various Dutch and British colonies has recently caused conflicts between Britain and Japan, and there have been many conflicts between Japan and the Netherlands. The Philippines is a part of the South Seas, and its current master is the United States, which is very close to Japan. Since the situation in the Pacific has become increasingly tense, Japan has been making more efforts in military and economic terms. Therefore, since the United States established the Philippine Independence Act ten years later, those Filipinos with great vision have been pessimistic, fearing that it will become the second Manchuria in the future. However, what is the actual strength of Japan in the Philippines? This should also be what those who care about Eastern issues want to know. Please briefly describe the outline as follows:</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, there were very few Japanese people in the Philippines. Apart from the life of a small trader, there was no other achievement. At that time, the United States had just taken over the Philippines, and there was a place called Davao in the south, which was sparsely populated. The government allowed people to claim land for reclamation. In 1904, a Japanese named Ota Kyosaburo came here to run a small business and knew that planting was promising in this area. So he went to Taiwan to make friends with the authorities and offered the plan of cultivating Davao to the Governor-General of Taiwan. The Governor-General thought it was feasible and invested one million as capital. Many nobles and wealthy merchants also joined. Ota then came to Davao with the capital and established the Ota Industrial Co., Ltd. for large-scale cultivation. From then on, he reclaimed wasteland, built roads and water conservancy projects, and built wharves. Japanese farmers and workers continued to come, with hemp as their main business. The planting and stripping were done using scientific methods, so the product's fiber was tough, long, and white, which was the best in the Philippines. They were all transported to Japanese factories, made into hemp fabrics, and then imported back to the Philippines for sale. Davao is now a trading port. Every week, large Japanese ships come and go directly. Initially, Chinese and Japanese immigrants had the same regulations in the Philippine government. Later, because of their country's wealth and strength, the government treated them as equals to Europeans and Americans (the so-called immigration law was to crack down on the people of China, India, and Korea). Farmers, businessmen, and workers could travel through the islands with just a letter of introduction from the Japanese consul, without having to go through immigration bureau investigations or pay 20 yuan in stamp fees for a residence permit, with Davao as their base camp. Therefore, in the Japanese residential area in Davao, there are schools, hospitals, and other organizations. In addition to the Ota Company, there is also the Furukawa Company, which is also very large in scale. Davao has now become a Japanese world. According to the Japanese consul's announcement, its population accounts for two-thirds of the Japanese in the islands. Also, the Philippine Congress passed a law in 1919 stating that foreigners could not own land in the Philippines. According to the Japanese consul's announcement, the Japanese in Davao only purchased 2,500 hectares of land, all of which were legally purchased before 1919. However, at the opening of the Philippine Constitutional Convention this year, the representative of Davao Province gave a public speech, revealing the inside story of Japanese land purchases in the province, saying that the provincial authorities had allowed the Japanese in the area to develop real estate without seeking relief. The upper class figures in Davao often bought land from the government and then resold it to the Japanese in the area. Since this report was issued, Philippine newspapers have published warning news, arousing the attention of Filipinos. Unexpectedly, not long after, there was another case of smuggling arms.</p>
<p>After the Davao district representative exposed the inside story of land purchases, the representative of the Mindanao Province (adjacent to Davao) made a more important report, saying that he had received secret information that the Japanese were smuggling arms into Davao on Japanese ships and hiding them in Japanese tombs. This issue is even more serious, because the Japanese intention is to make Davao a military hypothetical base. For the future Japanese-American war, there is a great threat, which has aroused great attention from the American and Philippine authorities.</p>
<p>Not only that, the intrusion of Japanese fishing boats into Philippine territorial waters is also common. Sometimes, the theft of maps is also discovered. The Philippine authorities have no way to investigate deeply. Recently, it was discovered that the Japanese fishing boat Haiyang Maru in Palawan (a southern province) was smuggling explosives and contraband. Military police boarded the ship to search, and the sailors of the ship shot and killed the military police and threw the body into the sea. The ship sped off to Taiwan. Although the Philippine customs dispatched four cruisers to pursue, they were not found. The Philippine government wanted to continue the extradition according to law, but the Taiwanese Japanese authorities and the Tokyo press refused extradition, expressing a tough attitude. The Philippine government also has no judicial disposition, and will only become a pending case in the future.</p>
<p>As for the commercial power of the two countries in the Philippines, Japan has made rapid progress compared to the United States. According to the announcement of the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 1932, the total imports of the Philippines were 159.79 million yuan, of which U.S. goods were 102.98 million, accounting for about 65%. In 1933, the total imports of the Philippines were 149.36 million yuan, of which U.S. goods were 87.57 million, accounting for about 59%. In 1932, Japanese goods imported into the Philippines were only 9.45 million yuan. In 1933, it increased to 19.13 million yuan, an increase of more than 50% in one year, which has revealed its trend of replacing U.S. goods. Now the Philippines has not yet broken away from the U.S. relationship, and Japan's actions are already like this. Then, who knows that the so-called guarantee of Philippine independence will not repeat the old tune of annexing Korea and occupying the Northeast after independence, and say that in order to maintain peace in East Asia, the Philippines must be placed under its sphere of influence? Therefore, it has aroused the self-endangerment of the Filipinos. Therefore, the Philippine Resident Commissioner to the United States, Mr. Nitta, when he went to the United States last month to take office, made a statement to the "Armed Town" reporter of the U.S. newspaper in the Philippines, advocating that the Philippines should continue to rely on the protection of the United States for the next 25 years. He also spoke in the United States on the 24th of this month, saying that "Filipinos fear Japan and their security depends on the continued protection of the United States." Many people in the Philippine business community and other circles have also begun to move, and will submit a petition to the U.S. Congressional delegation that will arrive in the Philippines next month, requesting the U.S. Congress to extend the ten-year transition period of the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Act (the Philippine Independence Act proposed by U.S. congressmen) to twenty years. The Philippine Congress's immediate independence faction has not dared to express its opinions on the above proposal, which also shows the depth of fear of Japan.

<p>On the 17th, we departed from Yandun, passed through the Yidao post station. The strata on both banks are seven or eight feet thick, with yellow sand on top and red soil below, the two not mixing together. Looking to the right, the Tianshan Mountains are dazzling with snow. Gazing at the Gobi Desert, the scenery is ever-changing. After more than ten miles, the road splits into two. The south leads to Chang Liushui, which is the main road, and the north leads to Hui Zhuangzi, which is a small road. Both places are sixty miles east of Yandun. However, Hui Zhuangzi has lush grasslands, which are far better than Chang Liushui. We traveled north to Tielejiang in order to fully feed the horses. After twenty miles, we crossed a black sand dry river. To the east, the Gobi Desert stretches as far as the eye can see. To the west, reeds cover the field, and clusters of red willow and white poplar are every few steps. More than ten riders gallop among them, unable to see the beginning or the end. The lushness of the vegetation can be imagined. Twenty miles to Hui Zhuangzi, there are two or three earthen houses, clear streams winding around, willow and apricot trees lining the road, and fertile fields of about one hundred and several tens of acres. Only one farmer lives there, but his resources are insufficient, and most of the land is barren. Twenty miles to the south, there are more than twenty white poplar trees and four or five farming families. This is Chang Liushui. Only because the land is flat and the air is fresh (thin and with less vapor), the two places, although twenty miles apart, seem as close as next door. Several tens of miles to the southwest, there are more faint village trees. The beauty of the scenery is the best since coming to Andunxi.</p>
<p>Before the sun had set completely in the west, the crowd decided to continue. The soil we were traveling on was soft and fertile, suitable for cultivation. The abundant grass we saw was deep enough to submerge the riders. Three or five horses grazing among the reeds were fattening up in the autumn. Their loud neighing often startled passersby. Thirty miles to Liu Jia Zhuangzi, and ten miles further west is Kekeyi Well, hence this place is also known as Kekeyi Well. We took off the saddles, released the horses, and stayed there. The weather was warm, and we only needed a lined jacket. I remembered that when we passed Malian Well before, heavy fur coats were not warm enough. Now we have entered a warm land, as if coming from a cold zone. A few days ago, in order to avoid the shopkeeper's insistence on eating half-raw meat, horse sausage, and mutton that had been slaughtered for a long time, I pretended to have a toothache, still fearing that people would not believe me. Later, because the weather changed drastically, with one day of cold and heat like two zones, and also because of the fatigue of riding, the fire in my body easily rose, causing my left tooth to really become painful. It can be said that "ask and you shall receive."</p>
<p>There is an earthen house in Liu Jia Zhuang. Entering the walled gate, the courtyard is covered with a grass shed, enclosing a stone mill. The house is divided into two rooms, one for storing food and vegetables, and the other for the tenant farmer to live in. The tenant farmer is a Hui farmer, so the interior arrangement is different. The back part of the room is a kang, occupying about two-thirds of the entire room, about seven or eight inches higher than the original ground. It is covered with felt blankets and used for all kinds of work, eating, and drinking. At night, the bedding is spread out for sleeping, and in the morning, the bedding is piled in the wall cabinet or in the left corner behind the kang, covered with a floral curtain, which looks neat and tidy. In the right front corner of the kang, a stove is built against the wall, level with the kang. The stove hole is dug deep underground, and when burning firewood, one squats inside the kang and curves a groove under the kang, so that the kang is heated when cooking. In the left front corner of the kang, another stove is built against the wall, and the smoke passes through the roof. Its style is exactly the same as the fireplace used in Western buildings, except that the former is made of earth and the latter is made of metal. History says that ancient Western European culture was mostly transmitted from Central Asia. Now, seeing the wall stove can be used as evidence. The Hui woman and her three or four daughters all wear melon-skin caps woven with thread, colored in five colors, but without a top knot. Those who are married wear long braids hanging down their backs, and those who are not married wear three or four braids each, without a fixed number. They wear red cloth long skirts and short jackets, and their bare feet wear boots like men's. The mother and daughters look like sisters, with an age difference of only fourteen years. This is because the Hui custom values early marriage. Girls marry as early as thirteen or fourteen years old and can have children early. Outside the walled gate, there are two large deep pits, obliquely dug with earthen steps to connect the top and bottom. One is covered with an earthen roof, called the "Underground Cellar Room," which is warm in winter and cool in summer, and is still used for living. The other has no roof, called the "Open-air Stable," which is blocked by wooden steps and can hold livestock. A little further away, there is another circular earthen stove, about three feet high, shaped like a kiln, like a skin-smoking stove, called the "Naan Pit," which is used for baking dough. Its function is quite similar to a steamer. The method is to first burn firewood and grass, making it into ashes and charcoal. The inner edge of the pit is red hot, and then the prepared dough is placed one by one on the side, covering the opening for a moment, and it will immediately turn yellow and cooked, with a crisp texture and fragrant taste. Its name is "Naan." This is the main food of the Hui people. Other things, such as roasted meat, which must be used to entertain guests, are also mostly roasted in the Naan pit.</p>
<p>The village land is sixty square miles, and the same land has been opened for cultivation for seven years. The white poplar and green apricot trees that have been cultivated are only as thick as a handful, slender and lush, and very lovable. The area of ​​Hami County is about 200,000 square miles, and the arable land is less than 1%. As for the remaining 99%, the coarse sand Gobi Desert cannot be cultivated. As for the fine sand grassland, as long as the water source problem is solved, there is nothing that cannot be cultivated. To solve the water source problem, it is impossible to divert the snow water of the Tianshan Mountains or the river water. The only way is to dig "Karez" (see attached pictures). The barren mountains and wastelands of Hami were originally controlled by "Wangye." After repeated negotiations with the provincial government, they have gradually been opened up in recent years. If the people want to cultivate a certain land, they must first register with the county government, and then dig a "Karez" to obtain water. The county government will then issue a license. They will plant for the first three years and be exempt from paying grain tax. From the fourth year onwards, they must pay the grain tax according to the amount. For a time, those who applied for reclamation were very enthusiastic. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining water from the "Karez" and the occurrence of the incident twenty years ago, the result of this reclamation was not very significant. According to Liu Yuanxiao, the owner of Wang Jia Zhuang, "The success of cultivation here means that all kinds of grains are suitable for cultivation. On average, one stone of wheat seed can yield eleven stones of wheat. According to this year's grain price, each stone of wheat weighs 400 catties and is worth about 16 yuan. Eleven stones are worth a total of 176 yuan. After deducting the official grain of three dou, which is equivalent to 4.8 yuan, the seed one stone of 16 yuan, the cattle labor four frames totaling 4 yuan, the labor 40 totaling 8 yuan, plus miscellaneous expenses of several yuan, the total expenditure is about 40 yuan. After deducting the expenditure, each stone of land can obtain a net profit of more than 130 yuan. No fertilizer is applied to the land. Each year, one-third of the planting is rotated, and the remaining two-thirds are plowed and dried for two years, which is as effective as applying fertilizer. Twenty years ago, a Hui rebellion occurred, and they dared not return to cultivate the land themselves. Therefore, they rented it out to Hui farmers according to the equal division method. Many other Han Chinese farmland are also handled in this way." This shows that Hami is sparsely populated, the soil is fertile, and the tax is light. If the leadership and management are effective, the agricultural future is indeed promising.</p>
<p>I don't know when the Xinjiang "Karez" was created, but since Lin Zexu came to Xinjiang, he vigorously promoted it, and it began to spread to various places and achieved results. The digging method of "Karez" is roughly as shown in the attached figure. First, dig a ditch in a low and humid place, which is level with the ground. Initially, it is called the "Tunnel Entrance" (as shown in Figure A). The tunnel is five feet high and two feet wide, which is convenient for digging sand and soil, and also convenient for the outflow of well water. At the same time, from the ground, along the line that the tunnel wants to pass through, wells are dug every five or six zhang (as shown in Figure D) in order to connect with the "Tunnel Ditch" (as shown in Figure AO connecting line). This is to ventilate and take sand, and to facilitate</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>future repairs. The well is initially seven or eight feet deep, and later, due to the gradually rising ground, it is as deep as six or seven zhang (the Karez in Turpan is as deep as thirty or forty zhang). All are dug to the groundwater line (as shown in Figure AO connecting line). The wells are connected to form a huge flow, gushing out continuously throughout the four seasons (as shown in the arrow). Each "Karez" has dozens or even hundreds of wells, and the tunnel ditch is more than ten miles long. Digging it is a real waste of manpower. Digging but not getting water is called "White Karez." The custom uses "White Karez" to refer to things that are laborious but fruitless, or to people who are useless. The meaning is based on this. The wellhead must be properly sealed, and the tunnel entrance must be blocked in winter to prevent cold air from flowing in, freezing and collapsing. However, the rushing water flow can still be allowed to go out.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Tang Yulin's Lawsuit with Former Subordinates <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Accused His Chief of Military Supplies at the Military Branch</p>
<p>Alleging Embezzlement of 500,000 Yuan in Military Uniform Expenses</p>
<p>Tianjin communication, after Tang Yulin lost power, his children, grandchildren, and other descendants mostly lived in peace and affluence in Pingjin. However, when Tang was in power, the province of Rehe was his family's world. His nephews and nieces relied on their power to be tyrannical and did many unjust things, making enemies with many people. Once their feathers were hidden, those who had been bullied by them in the past took the opportunity to rise up and thought of revenge. As a result, the Tang family has been involved in numerous lawsuits. The Tianjin court has accepted cases such as Tang Yulin's divorce from his concubine, Ms. Hu, Tang's eldest son, Zuo Rong's embezzlement of Rehe Lama's scriptures, embezzlement of antiquities from the Lama Temple, divorce from his concubines, Ms. Zhao and Ms. Zhang, (Tang Yulin's) grandson's divorce from his daughter-in-law, and (Tang Yulin's) daughter's elopement with Jiang Jing. These cases have made Tianjin chaotic. After more than a year, three or five have been decided after legal sanctions, and some are still undecided, such as Tang Zuo Rong's embezzlement of antiquities from the Rehe Lama Temple. The Tianjin Land Inspection Office is investigating the evidence and has not yet finished the hearing. The other is Tang Zuo Fu's embezzlement case. This matter is slightly more dignified than the other Tang family lawsuits. Tang Yulin has recently submitted a petition to the Beiping Military Branch, requesting a military trial. The incident has gradually expanded and become heated. The outline is as follows: When Tang Yulin was the commander of the Rehe Border Defense, his son Zuo Fu was the Director of Finance. Zuo Fu was greedy for money and goods. He found out that Liu Baoqing, the Chief of Military Supplies of the Rehe Border Defense Command, had embezzled 500,000 yuan in military uniform expenses. Tang Zuo Fu planned to split the money, but Liu refused. Zuo Fu then reported it to his father and had Liu arrested and imprisoned. At the same time, Zuo Fu, together with Huang Jinbiao, the adjutant of the Border Defense Command, Tan Yufu, the captain of the motorcade, and his concubine Jin Ziling, came to Tianjin and stayed in their house on Sanma Road in the Italian Concession. They tricked Liu Baoqing's mother, Liu's brother Bao Fu, and many other relatives into being privately imprisoned in their Italian Concession house, where they were tortured and forced to sign evidence of the transfer of all their property. Only after Liu Bao Fu and his mother signed the promise were they released. After Liu's mother returned home, she fell ill with fright and died. The Liu family's property, worth hundreds of thousands, was transferred to Tang's hands. When Rehe fell, Liu Baoqing escaped and returned to Tianjin. Last year, he sued Zuo Fu in the Tianjin court for embezzling property, illegal imprisonment, and other crimes. After several trials, Zuo Fu denied that he had ever come to Tianjin, saying that the matter existed, but it was done by Huang Jinbiao, Tan Yufu, and others under the orders of their superiors and had nothing to do with him. He also said that Liu Baoqing was able to become the Chief of Military Supplies because Liu set up a brothel at the Shenyang West Station. When Tang was prostituting, he met Liu's father and, through various relationships, was able to be appointed as a confidant. His family property was accumulated from embezzling public funds over the years. The court held that even if these things were true, they were not enough to defend the case. Therefore, the result of the first trial was that Tang was sentenced to three years and six months in prison, his concubine Jin Ziling was sentenced to eight months in prison, and Tan Yufu, the captain of the motorcade, was sentenced to three years and six months in prison, all in prison. This spring, Tan Yufu died in prison. Zuo Fu and his concubine refused to accept the first-instance judgment and appealed to the High Court, and requested a transfer of jurisdiction, which was not permitted. The High Court conducted the first hearing on the 11th of this month, and the most detailed investigation was made on whether Tang Zuo Fu and his concubine Jin Ziling came to Tianjin that day. Zuo Fu is addicted to opium and committed opium crimes once with his concubine in prison. Later, he repeatedly requested bail for illness, but was not allowed. Therefore, he hated Liu Baoqing very much. In order to rescue his son, Tang Yulin specially submitted a petition to the Ping Military Branch, accusing Liu Baoqing of embezzling more than 500,000 yuan in military uniform expenses during his tenure as Chief of Military Supplies, which involved military matters. Therefore, he requested a subpoena for trial. The Military Branch then sent the leader of the eleventh group to Tianjin to investigate with the court a few days ago. Therefore, this case may be transferred to the Ping Military Branch for adjudication. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Purple Cloud Cave Adventure in Hangzhou <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang National Military Training Association Organizes a Team to Explore</p>
<p>Sensational Throughout the City, Tourists Flock</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Jade Emperor Mountain in the south of the city towers into the clouds. During the severe drought this summer, Zhang Tianshi (a Daoist master) planned to perform rituals there, but it did not materialize. Halfway up the mountain is the ancient Purple Cloud Cave, rumored to extend to Huizhou. Previously, it was covered in overgrown weeds and mist, obscuring the cave entrance. Although pilgrims flocked to the mountain peak, no one had ever explored its depths. Last month, the Hangzhou YMCA initiated an exploration, but it failed to complete the task due to insufficient preparations. On the 9th of this month, Xiao Zuguang, Gu Yiming, Yu Wuqing, Chen Jiayu, Lin Heng, and others from the Zhejiang National Military Training Association, along with He Wengan, Luo Xine, Hu Bosun, Sun Daoren, and more than ten others from the Hangzhou National New Society, organized a Purple Cloud Cave exploration team with the intention of breaking superstitions and inspiring a spirit of national adventure. Each member carried a strong flashlight, as well as ropes, knives, self-defense pistols, hemp ropes, wooden sticks, tape measures, compasses, cameras, and other self-defense equipment. They also prepared a commemorative wooden plaque with the signatures of all the team members. At 10 a.m. on the 9th, they ascended the mountain. After reaching the cave entrance, each team member took off their long coats and tied the rope end to a stone. He Wengan and Luo Xine led the way into the cave, immediately stooping to enter the tunnel, which sloped westward at an angle of about forty degrees to the horizontal. They advanced more than twenty fathoms.</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Cave Passage Narrows, Barely Enough Room to Pass <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>They continued to advance diagonally downward for another forty fathoms, then turned south. The walls were slightly wider than before, creating a sloping area that could accommodate more than ten people. By this time, all one hundred fathoms of hemp rope tied to the cave entrance had been used. They struck the rocks with stones and then crept forward again. After another twenty fathoms, the cave passage dropped straight down, forming a ninety-degree angle with the horizontal. Shining a thousand-foot-strong flashlight down, they peered over the edge, facing an abyss. The light could not reach the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Jagged Stone Walls, A Gaping Mountain Root <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Subsequently, on the right side of the rock face, they discovered a crack that could be climbed up and down. Each of them untied one end of the five-fathom-long hemp rope they were carrying, secured it to the rock crevice, and lowered the other end from the cave entrance. First, Luo Xine descended along the rope, carrying a pistol and the wooden plaque. At the bottom of the rope, he shone the flashlight down and saw a protruding rock that could be used as a foothold. He then leaped down the cliff. The electric torch illuminated a space of about one square fathom. The rock walls were like...</p>

<p>The bottom of the cave was as flat as water, formed purely of accumulated fine mud. He Wengan jokingly fired his gun into the ground, and the bullet entered the soil with a "whoosh" sound. They also discovered a stone tube standing upright to the northwest, which could still be climbed by hugging the wall. He Wengan...</p>
<p>He Wengan and Luo Xine, carrying the commemorative plaque, wearing shorts, and barefoot, clung to the wall and ascended. First, they pressed their backs against the east side of the cave, with their feet against the opposite rock wall, wriggling their muscles, inch by inch. Although...</p>

<p>Their ambition drove them to reach the very end. After about six fathoms, they found a place to stand on the west side of the rock wall. Shining the light upwards, they saw stalactites hanging down from the top and two pairs of bats perched there. He and Luo used small knives to carve off a piece of strange rock and placed the commemorative plaque on a stone "chair." They then climbed back down the wall and took a photo with their companions in the cave. Because they did not bring magnesium flash, the image was blurry. They agreed to follow the original route and climb out of the cave using the rope. There were dozens of onlookers at the cave entrance, lighting candles and applauding their success. By then, it was 6:40 p.m. The team later...</p>
<h3 id="e98">Announces the Experience, Rewards Adventure <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Said that anyone who could retrieve the commemorative plaque would be awarded a one-year subscription to the Hangzhou National News. After the news spread, Zhou Zhaohua, a skilled athlete from Guangdong, and others entered the cave the next day, retrieved the commemorative plaque, and captured a pair of bats. The National News Agency has begun to provide daily subscriptions. Xu Shilong and others from the Zhejiang Automobile Company also brought batteries, wires, and electric cannons. Others carrying knives and sticks in groups of three or five flocked to the path. The military training association exploration team, fearing that the crowds of tourists would inevitably lead to accidental falls and injuries, braved the stars and dew at 11 p.m. on the 13th and entered the cave at midnight.</p>

<p>They also found a photograph of Zhou Zhaohua and others on the top of the cave. According to an old Daoist priest living on the mountain, the previous time, Westerners from the Meifu (Mobil) Company had climbed down the wall but were unable to climb back up. Fortunately, their police dog came out of the cave and signaled to the Daoist, who rescued them with a white cloth. Seven sets of corpses were found at the bottom of the cave and have been buried. Breaking through the rocky cave was something no one had done before.</p>

<p>Recently, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the city, and local people feel alarmed. They are planning to handle winter defense to deter bandits. Unexpectedly, at 9 a.m. this morning (the 15th), at the Rifeng Silver Shop in Fengle Bridge in the city, a young man in a Western suit carried out a robbery under the guise of purchasing gold bracelets. The shopkeeper, Zhao Houzhuang, from Shaoxing, aged 64, seeing that the man looked suspicious, tried to snatch back the gold bracelet. The young man in the Western suit shot him with a pistol, the bullet entering his left chest and exiting his right chest. The young man handed the gold bracelet, weighing more than one tael, to an accomplice who was keeping watch, and they fled the city across the Shuiguan Bridge together. The guard police chased after them and telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to have the security team surround and arrest them. A large number of armed police were dispatched to pursue them. As a result, a pistol and a dagger were seized by the water patrol team near the Yang Bridge at No. 22 Zhongpanlongtang Railway outside the East Gate. A student certificate from the Xu Hui Public School was also found. The team leader interrogated him. According to his confession, his name was Zhao Zhiyi, 21 years old, from Changmen, Suzhou. He was married to a daughter of Yang Yengeng in this city. His father worked for the Shanghai Public Security Bureau. He directly admitted that he and a Qiu surnamed man from Suzhou, who worked as a partner in a sauce garden, had robbed the Rifeng Bank together. The original stolen item was taken away by Qiu, who was on the run. The Water Patrol Team and the Public Security Bureau jointly searched for the fleeing Qiu and searched the sauce garden, but found no evidence. The captured Zhao Zhiyi was temporarily detained pending dispatch to the county for investigation. The injured Rifeng Bank assistant, Zhao Houzhuang, was taken to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. It is said that he is old and weak. If he does not develop a fever, his life may be safe. Currently, people from all walks of life in the area are concerned that robberies have occurred in prosperous urban areas, causing concerns about public security.</p>

<p>The county has long had a secret organization called the High Collar Gang, which specializes in making trouble, turning falsehoods into reality, and engaging in various base and violent acts such as gathering crowds to beat people. The beating of Ge Renyuan, director of the Education Bureau, in the spring was done by them. The gang members are scattered in various places, and if their wishes are not met, disaster will strike immediately. Recently, the gang members started an internal conflict due to uneven distribution of spoils. Four gang members, Zong Qichang, Cai Yushan, and Zhang Yongnian, published a notice in the newspaper to leave the gang and demanded that the gang leader, Li Kunwu, return their membership cards. This attracted the attention of the authorities, who are investigating and arresting them. Suddenly, they received a tip. The county party headquarters summoned the four who had published the notice and interrogated them. On the afternoon of the 14th, the party committee, Shi Minyong, secretly sent a letter to the county government, and together with the Public Security Bureau and a forensic doctor, searched Li Kunwu's home in Shuyuan Lane. Li Kunwu happened to be home and was immediately arrested. The articles of association of the Yiyou Mutual Aid Society, membership cards, and the complete case file of the analysis of the assets of the wealthy merchant brothers, Yang Zhanghang, were found. They were immediately taken to the bureau and transferred to the county judiciary for interrogation.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter, robberies have been frequently reported in various parts of Suzhou. Zhang Jinbang and other seven bandits captured by the Detective Team of the No. 2 Water Public Security District a few days ago are highly suspected of involvement in the robbery case at the home of Tang Shichang in Ximachi. The district headquarters notified Tang, and on the 15th, he sent personnel to identify them. Because the robbery took place at night and the faces were blurry, they could not be identified. The investigation is ongoing. The case of the Machengji Tu Gao shop at No. 52 Bifengfang Lane in the city has not yet been solved. County Magistrate Wu is paying close attention to this case. He ordered the Public Security Bureau yesterday to solve the case within three days. Zhang Hanwei, director of the Public Security Bureau, is concerned that the continuous robberies in the city are a matter of local security. Yesterday, he and the security team, Nie, met to discuss district defense. At that time, it was decided that the Public Security Bureau and the security team would send officers to station at the city gates and at wharves and vehicle stations to inspect suspicious passengers at any time. This will be implemented today (the 16th). At the same time, a proposal was submitted to the County Political Conference to organize a joint military-police inspection office to maintain local security.</p>

<p>Majishan in the 10th District of Wu County was planned as a scenic area by former County Magistrate Cai Peijian. Because the area is surrounded by lakes on three sides and borders land on one side, the scenery is beautiful, but the more than 7,000 mu of land there is often flooded by the lake, resulting in poor harvests. In February of this year, local gentlemen Zhuang Zhongxi and Qian Linshu and others organized a committee to raise funds for building embankments and sluice gates. The funds were set at more than 20,000 yuan, which were temporarily advanced by the relief agency, the impoverished children's hospital, and the estate management office. After the project is completed, the benefited fields will repay the funds in three years. Construction began in early March. After more than eight months, the project has been completed. The embankment is twelve miles long, with three large sluice gates in the middle to regulate the water flow. As a result, this year's harvest is very good. District Chief Liao Zhigui reported the completion of the embankment project to the county government. The county magistrate, in addition to commissioning the Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Baoguang to inspect and accept the project, also scheduled to take the Wuyi Road long-distance bus to Xueyanqiao at 7 a.m. today (the 15th) with Wang Chao from the County Party Headquarters and others, hire a boat to Majishan to personally inspect and accept the project, and inspect the Baojia situation along the way.</p>

<p>The entire group of more than 80 students from the Provincial Tobacco Control Committee Investigator Training Class, after completing their training period, were divided into 12 groups and assigned to serve in various counties, adopting a guerrilla inspection method. Li Gongfu was assigned to Jiangyin, and on the 13th, he met with Zhang Xiabu, the newly appointed secretary, at the County Tobacco Control Association. He then dispatched investigator Xie Jian to inspect the rehabilitation center and then went to various sales points to investigate the daily sales volume of opium. At the Xinsheng Sales and Smoking Center on Hongqiao Riverbank, because the number of opium paste sales did not match and extra licenses were discovered, the contractor, Li Kunrong, was handed over to the Public Security Bureau for detention, pending interrogation by the Tobacco Control Association.</p>

<p>Zhao Dihua, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, recently stated that there are many cases of county magistrates whose accounts have not been cleared. It is necessary to investigate and set a deadline for submission. At the same time, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu of this county also reported that the accounts of past county magistrates and directors of the finance bureau have not been cleared. Therefore, he specially requested that a committee be appointed to investigate. Director Zhao then ordered Zhang Hesheng to come to Wuxi and be stationed in the county for investigation. It has now been found that the accounts of the previous county magistrates Zhang Hougu, Lin Fuozhen, Yang Tianji, and the county magistrates Yu Fu, Yu Liu, Kong Xiankeng, and ten other appointments have not been cleared. Among them, Zhang's losses are the greatest, totaling more than 10,000 yuan. Yang's losses are more than 3,000 yuan, and Lin's losses are the least, only 27 yuan. The cases have been reported to the department for verification and recovery. Former County Magistrate Yang has come to Xi and calculated the situation clearly, and the others have been notified to submit payment. A portion is still being cleared.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Appeal to Approve Increased Tax on Northeast Soybean Oil <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The local oil mill industry guild stated that they had seen reports that the tax rate for food products, including soybean oil, shipped from Northeast to Shanghai was originally set at 15% of the value. Recently, in order to stop dumping and manipulation in the Northeast and protect the industry and commerce of the southeastern provinces, the Ministry of Finance changed it to 30% of the value. The future of the industry was deeply reliant on this policy. However, they suddenly heard that someone was opposing it, vaguely stating that the Ministry of Finance had cancelled the previous order. In recent years, oil mills have sprung up in Shanghai, Hankou, Xichang, and other places, and the soybean oil produced is sufficient for people's food. Since the Japanese and puppet regimes in the Northeast have dumped cheap soybean oil into the interior, the market supply has exceeded demand, and the inland oil mills have been greatly affected. If the order to increase taxes is cancelled again, it will inevitably be completely destroyed by the Japanese and puppet regimes. Therefore, yesterday they specially sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting them to telegraph the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original order to increase taxes on Northeast soybean oil in order to protect industry and commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Land Price Declaration Deadline <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The declaration of urban land prices in Wuxi has been open for more than six months. It has been extended twice, and yesterday was the final deadline. At 6 p.m., the declaration was officially closed. The township chiefs of various towns in the city assisted in guiding and instructing people these past few days. The number of households that declared their land prices has reached about 80%. The Land Price Declaration Office has begun preparing to carry out the work that needs to be done after the declaration is completed. The declaration forms filled out by the property owners will be sorted by town and township and used to write a public notice. The notice will be posted in front of the county government and various township offices for one month. If there are any objections to the land rights during the public notice period, the interested parties can file a lawsuit with the court. After the trial results are available, the winning party will notify the Land Price Declaration Office to include the land in the land price register. If no one raises an objection during the public notice period, the property rights will be determined and the land will be included in the land price register. In addition, if there are any fraudulent declarations, they will be handled according to the law. If the property rights are determined, it will be very difficult to make corrections. Furthermore, Article 10 of the Provincial Land Price Declaration Regulations stipulates that anyone who has obtained rights other than ownership (surface rights, easements, perpetual tenancy rights, pawn rights, mortgage rights) should obtain a list from the office and fill it out from today (the 16th) until the end of the public notice period.</p>

<p>Yin Deying, a 56-year-old villager in Daqiao, Yiling Town, Sixth District, was wealthy in the area, which attracted the attention of bandits. At about 4 a.m. on October 26th, six or seven bandits, armed with knives and clubs, entered through the side door and searched extensively. Because they found nothing, they kidnapped Yin Zixiangdao (22 years old), took him away by boat, and fled east. Afterwards, Deying reported to the authorities for investigation, but no arrests were made. However, the Yin family was repeatedly contacted by kidnappers, but the negotiations failed due to the excessive demands. On the 11th, Xiangdao's aunt, Jiang, passed by Fuchenei, Zishu Village, and saw a floating corpse that resembled her nephew. She reported to Deying and hired someone to pull it ashore. Although the face was covered with knife wounds and blurred, it was confirmed to be Xiangdao. It was then learned that he had been torn up by the kidnappers. He was carried home, and the local prosecutor's office was asked to inspect the body. The office sent Inspector Meng on the morning of the 15th to inspect the body.</p>

He is expected to return to Nanjing soon. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Strict Security <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The news of Chairman Chiang's visit to Shanghai had been widely circulating in the city since the day before yesterday. The local authorities had assigned military and police to guard and protect the Hongqiao Airport. They were withdrawn only in the evening. Yesterday morning, there were reports that he would leave Nanjing at 8:00 AM and fly to Shanghai. After receiving the reports, the Municipal Security Department and the Public Security Bureau assigned many military and police to prepare for the visit. The Security Department, led by Wu Chuanxin, the Second Battalion Commander of the Second Regiment, deployed the First Battalion of the Special Security Team and a platoon of motorized vehicles. The Public Security Bureau, led by Tan Baoshou, the Chief Inspector, deployed a team of special police and a platoon of traffic police, along with the Security Team, distributed around the Hongqiao Airport, at the airport entrance, and at various intersections along Hongqiao Road and Daxi Road. Armed military police and traffic police were deployed to maintain strict security and direct traffic. Armed security teams patrolled along both sides of the roads.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Waiting at the Airport <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu, Director Yang of the Security Department, Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Military Headquarters, Madam Chiang, Madam Kong, and Soong Tzu-liang all arrived at Hongqiao Airport around 9:00 AM to welcome him. They waited until noon without any confirmed news. Madam Chiang and Madam Kong returned to their residences first, while the other dignitaries went to a villa in western Shanghai for lunch. After receiving confirmation that Chairman Chiang had departed from Nanjing by Sikorsky aircraft at 12:00 noon, they returned to the airport to welcome him. Madam Chiang and Madam Kong also rushed to the airport. Two bands from the Police Garrison Command and the Public Security Bureau were assigned to the airport and the entrance to the airport. Cheng Ziqing, the Chinese Inspector of the French Concession, also went to take care of matters.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Arrival Situation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The aircraft that Chiang arrived in was a Sikorsky amphibious aircraft, which he owned. It was piloted by pilot Smith. Normally, the journey only takes one and a half hours, but yesterday, due to uncertain weather and fog, it was delayed. The aircraft was not spotted until 2:05 PM coming from the northeast of the airport. In the blink of an eye, it reached the airport. After circling the airport once, it slowly landed from the southern sky at 2:10 PM. The dignitaries rushed forward to greet him. At 2:15 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang returned to the Kong residence by car to rest and have lunch.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Mr. Chiang's Demeanor <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chiang was dressed in a dark blue camel hair robe, a black wool waistcoat, and a black wool overcoat, a gray wool hat, and black cloth shoes. He was dressed very plainly, and his spirits were quite high. However, Chiang looked thin and gaunt because he had been involved in the suppression of bandits over the years, which had taken a toll on his physical and mental health. In addition, he had nine diseased teeth extracted in Beijing and had not yet had dentures fitted. However, he was still in good spirits and greeted each of the welcomers. The only people who accompanied Chiang on the plane to Shanghai were his Chief of Staff, He Yun, and Secretary Wang Ruizhang, both of whom were also dressed plainly. This was because Chiang was advocating the New Life Movement and was taking the lead by setting an example.</p>

<p>Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan, submitted his resignation to the central government, believing that the drafting of the constitution was complete and his major responsibilities could be considered finished. The central government, however, felt that there were still many important tasks awaiting Mr. Sun's completion, and therefore earnestly retained him. He also recently met with Liu Xiang, the pacification commissioner of Sichuan, and learned that Sichuan has vast mineral resources waiting to be developed. If he has the opportunity, he will definitely make a trip to Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Yuan Liang Discusses the Beiping Municipal Construction Plan <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Funding Methods Decided</p>
<p>No Result from Discussions on the Beiping-Hebei Boundary Demarcation</p>
<p>Yuan Liang, the mayor of Beiping, traveled south the other day to Beijing on official business. On the 14th, he came to Shanghai from Beijing to attend to private matters. This reporter specially visited him at his residence yesterday to inquire about the Beiping-Hebei boundary demarcation issue and the plan to develop Beiping into a cultural tourism district. According to Mr. Yuan, his trip south to Beijing was entirely about the construction of the Beiping cultural district, seeking instructions on all matters. The construction budget is estimated at 10 million yuan. The first phase of 3 million yuan has been decided, with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Railways, and the city of Beiping each bearing one-third of the cost, which should not be a problem. In the future, another 2 million yuan will be raised to build the newest and most complete hotels and cultural markets, with unified commodity prices. It is planned to be jointly operated by the municipal government and merchants to be a purely commercial organization. As for the main purpose of building the Beiping cultural district, on the one hand, it is to show the spirit of hard work and construction of the Chinese people and correct international perception. On the other hand, it is to attract huge amounts of tourism funds for the development of various enterprises. Regarding the Beiping-Hebei boundary demarcation issue, the Ministry of the Interior once held a meeting, chaired by Vice Minister Gan Naikwang, with representatives from the Hebei provincial government and himself in attendance. Both sides stated their reasons, and he refuted the various points that Beiping should not be expanded. The meeting ended without a result. He only knows that he is acting on orders and knows nothing else. It is heard that Mr. Yuan is scheduled to leave Shanghai today to return to Beiping to attend to his duties.</p>

<p>Central Bank</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, chairman of the Shanghai Drought Relief Association, planned to allocate more relief funds to various provinces and sent a letter to Ye Chucang, requesting the central government to allocate 300,000 yuan to convene a meeting regularly to distribute and send to the supervisors of various provinces to expedite relief. It is now learned that Ye responded to Xu's letter, "Mr. Jingren is greatly appreciated. I have read your letter and understand your kindness. You requested that we discuss with the Central Bank the loan of 500,000 yuan in relief funds and allocate 300,000 yuan first. I have agreed with Mr. Kong Yongzhi and can allocate it first. As for the 50,000 yuan previously approved by the Central Bank, I have instructed the staff to remit it immediately. Respectfully replying, I wish you success."</p>

<h3 id="e141">Reasons Why It Is Inconvenient to Re-Impose the Rayon Tax <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance's Reply to the National Products Factory Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Tax No. 3566, yesterday, "I have read your letter. The association proposes to re-impose a general tax on rayon blended fabrics to help the domestic silk industry. The theory is still correct, but the general tax is a factory output tax and should be collected on the factory's output. At present, there are no factories in the country that manufacture rayon, which does not comply with the principle of collecting the general tax. If we impose a general tax on woven products and determine the tax rate based on the rayon content, it is necessary to identify each blended fabric, which is very difficult. Even if we do not discuss it, most of the weaving of silk and all silk fabrics belongs to the household industry. After rayon is imported, it is dispersed to various places, and the weaving industry using rayon as raw material is extremely scattered and not concentrated. Investigation is even more difficult, and management is impossible. If we take care of one thing and lose sight of another, and there is more leakage than collection, it will still be of no help. The main reasons for the failure of China's silk industry are the reduction in overseas demand, the low price of silk, and the sharp decline in exports, not entirely due to the abundance of rayon and other products on the market. Moreover, the current rayon import tax rate is already above 60%, and the higher the tax rate, the more difficult it is to prevent smuggling and tax evasion. Therefore, merely discussing increasing taxes may still not be enough to protect the domestic silk export outlet. The request in the request is kept for reference."</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency, according to news from Songjiang, at the beginning of this month, a famous Shanghai profiteer purchased and transported a large number of inferior goods on two foreign merchant ships to China. In order to evade customs inspection and taxation, they secretly sailed to Jinshanwei, a county under their jurisdiction, and transferred them to Shanghai and Hangzhou. Unexpectedly, the special opportunity was not secret, and someone reported it to their superiors. After receiving the report, several warships were immediately dispatched to Jinshanwei overnight. When the merchant ships were hiring sampans and small boats to start unloading, they stopped when they saw the warships approaching and sailed to Zhoushan Island in Zhejiang Province to avoid temporarily, waiting for an opportunity. The provincial warships were stationed on the Jinshanwei sea surface for several days, and they did not see any movement, so they withdrew their defense. Seeing that the warships had left, the two merchant ships sailed back to the Tuolin sea area under the jurisdiction of the county and rented more than 70 sampans to unload in Tuolin, divided into more than 20 cars, and drove to Shanghai and Hangzhou. Mr. Mei Naikui, a Westerner, donated 25 yuan in silver dollars. A total of 151 yuan in silver dollars and 49 jiao in small foreign currency were received. The total to date is 171 yuan in silver dollars and 157 jiao in small foreign currency.</p>

It was then decided to add a second team to the original first relief team and immediately purchase relief supplies and medicine to transport them to Jiangxi for relief. It is now learned that the association's first relief team has been organized and is scheduled to depart for Jiangxi by merchant ship tomorrow, accompanied by Presidents Zhou Zongliang, Han Shichang, Zheng Baozi, and Li Dixian, as well as Chief Captain Chen Chaji, Han Yongxiang, Captain Nie Cheng Lin, Hu Zhongcheng, and all doctors, team members, and servants, more than 30 people, carrying many pieces of relief supplies and medicine.

<p>Recently, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly received soldiers from various divisions of the former 19th Route Army who have come to the bureau claiming that they have been laid off, or have been approved to be discharged, or have asked for leave to return to their hometown in Guangdong, and have run out of travel expenses on the way and are unable to purchase tickets, requesting relief, etc. The bureau has few Chinese shipping companies operating in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and the bureau's regulations limit each Chinese shipping company to send only two people free of charge. In this situation, soldiers are arriving in succession, and even if their difficulties are true, there is no way to issue free travel vouchers. As for charitable organizations, they do not have the funds to assist discharged soldiers, nor is it within their purview. The central urban area is far away, and travel requires funds. The army has previously served this city and has made outstanding contributions. The above situation is very pitiful. I am afraid that the soldiers do not understand the truth and hope that they will pay attention to avoid futile trips.</p>

<p>Registered Stamps Will Be Returned Upon Presentation of Proof</p>
<p>Those Who Have Not Registered Should Register Promptly</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the measures for registering old stamp tax tickets and allowing installment exchanges, it has been reported that some unscrupulous merchants and dishonest clerks who have previously handled stamp tax affairs are taking advantage of the opportunity to purchase old stamp tax tickets at low prices in various places, hoping to profit from them. This seriously hinders national tax revenue and affects the allocation of public funds to local areas. To prevent such malpractices, the Ministry has specifically ordered the Jiangsu Stamp and Tobacco Tax Bureau to send personnel to supervise. After receiving the order, the Bureau has appointed Ge Cunxi to supervise the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Furthermore, it is understood that the old stamp tax ticket registration office established by the Chamber of Commerce has been operating since the 28th of last month, and registration has been very enthusiastic. The accumulated old stamps are quite numerous, and safekeeping has been a considerable challenge. For the sake of prudence, the Chamber of Commerce, in accordance with the Ministry's regulations on registering old stamp tax tickets, will return the registered old stamp tax tickets first, pending the Ministry's instructions on exchange procedures. All merchants who have registered with the Chamber of Commerce can bring the vouchers issued by the Chamber of Commerce to claim their stamps. Those who have not yet registered should register with the Chamber of Commerce before the 31st of this month, and no further extensions will be granted.</p>

<p>The Dasheng No. 1 Textile Company held its 36th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders yesterday at 2:00 PM. Present were 125 representatives including Li Yunliang, Wu Cheng, Chen Guangfu, Wang Dugong, Yu Xushi, Wu Jichen, Li Qiqing, Wu Weiru, Jin Weizhi, Zhu Zhaosheng, representing a total of 41,130 shares and 6,550 rights, exceeding the required quorum. The meeting was declared open. ㈠ Zhang Xiaoruo was elected as chairman. ㈡ Formalities were observed. ㈢ Chairman Zhang Xiaoruo reported on the business situation. ㈣ Manager Li Shengbo reported on innovation matters. ㈤ Supervisor Fang Juchuan reported on the 36th term's accounts. ㈥ The chairman announced the board of directors' proposed matters: (A) The factory's property in Wusong under the shipping company is proposed to be reorganized into a separate company specifically for management. (Explanation) It was decided at the shareholders' meeting in 1920 that 500,000 taels of silver from the factory's surplus profit would be allocated to the Sino-Belgian Shipping Company shares and 120,000 taels of silver to the second factory, with receipts issued to shareholders. However, due to various reasons, the shipping company could not be established. Eighty mu of land were purchased in Wusong in preparation for building a pier. At the shareholders' meeting in 1931, it was decided to reissue Dasheng Shipping deposit slips and to return the funds from the sale of the shipping land. In recent years, no one has purchased the land, and the company has not divested from its concurrent management. Moreover, the shipping company still has other shareholders who invested land as shares. Now, representatives from the Wusong Township Office have sent a letter requesting independence. After repeated discussions by the board of directors, it was agreed that the relationship between the textile industry and the real estate is relatively weak, and it would be better to establish a separate company, with shareholders consisting of the factory and those who invested land as shares. A separate registration will be made, and a special commissioner will be appointed to manage everything. In the future, either the land will be sold, or it will be developed in another way. The proceeds will be distributed to the original shipping shareholders. The resolution was passed. (B) The Jiangsu Provincial Government sent a letter stating that because Cheng Peng had resigned, Ren Zufan was nominated to supplement the factory's board of directors. The resolution was passed. ㈦ Re-election of supervisors. After counting the votes, Chen Guangfu, Fang Juchuan, and Yun Jishen were re-elected. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>

<p>Using Huge Donations as a Stepping Stone to Advancement</p>
<h3 id="e151">Zhang Shaolin Runs Schools to Collect Money <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Huge Amounts of Money Not Donated, Actually Collecting Money Under False Pretenses</p>
<p>Affected Students Report the Situation One After Another</p>
<p>Public figures from all walks of life in the city, including Pan Gongzhan, Li Dachao, Wang Xiaoying, Lin Pengxia, Tao Xingzhi, He Bingsong, Huang Jingwan, Liu Renhang, Shen Jiucheng, and others, recognizing the difficulties of the nation and the decline of culture, believed that only through popular education could the nation's crisis be saved and the people's knowledge increased. This summer, they gathered comrades from all walks of life to launch the China Popular Education Promotion Association and establish schools, so that poor children would not be denied access to education. While preparations were underway, a man named Zhang Shaolin, residing at No. 25 Zhenxing Lane, Muer Ming Road, visited the preparatory office in July, expressed his sincere willingness to support the association, claiming to have a large inheritance and wishing to donate over 10,000 yuan to the association's fund. The initiators, thinking that Zhang was so enthusiastic about contributing money to promote education, considered him worthy of respect. As the matter was still in preparation and assistance was needed, the initiators unanimously elected him to handle the preparatory matters. However, after Zhang took office, his attitude changed abruptly, disregarding the importance of responsibility, and acting arbitrarily in everything. Furthermore, he took advantage of his position to advertise in the newspapers in August and September, recruiting free work-study students. The initiators believed that the recruitment of students had not been approved by the meeting, and that the association was still in the preparatory stage, not yet the time to recruit students. They immediately ordered a stop to the recruitment. However, Zhang ignored this and collected so-called uniform fees, book fees, badge fees, and apprenticeship fees from the students who came to register, creating various pretexts. The amount collected was not uniform, with some paying 40 yuan each, some 30 yuan, some 17 yuan, or 12 yuan, and the lowest being several yuan or one yuan, roughly based on the number of types of fees paid. The uniforms given to those who paid the uniform fee were extremely poor. The deceived students, suffering this unnecessary loss, could not remain silent and successively reported the situation through Fang, Zou, Zhang, Jiang, Lu, Tang, and others. The initiators of the association immediately conducted a secret investigation and obtained a great deal of evidence. Not only was it sufficient to prove that Zhang Shaolin was collecting money under the guise of running a school, but it was also discovered that Zhang was embezzling funds from the association. As for his so-called donation of inheritance, it was purely empty talk, nothing more than using it as a stepping stone to advancement. Now, the initiators believe that Zhang's fraudulent behavior has greatly affected their reputation and the association's cause and caused enormous losses. They find it difficult to forgive and have hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhang in the First Special District Court, requesting that he be summoned for questioning in accordance with Article 366 of the Criminal Law. However, Zhang, knowing that he could not escape punishment, fled without a trace after learning of the accusation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court. Because the defendant had not been summoned, the trial could not be opened. Only lawyer Sun presented the intent of the prosecution once, and Judge Liu ordered a postponement for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The city house at No. 177 Marlang Road in the French Concession is a two-story single-family storefront. The second landlord is Li A'jiao, a Ningbo native, 36 years old. Li's family lives upstairs, and the downstairs living room is sublet to others. There is a garage, but recently, because no car owner placed a car there, Li rented the downstairs to Guo Yongtai, a Yangzhou native, who opened a tin shop half a month ago. Furthermore, on the 25th of last month, he rented the pavilion room to Wang Guizhang, a Pudong native. Li also has fire insurance worth 1,500 yuan.</p>

<p>Wang Guizhang is in the rubber business and recently installed a water heater for heating due to the sudden cold weather, also using it as a boiler for boiling rubber, hoping to achieve both purposes in one fell swoop. However, yesterday, Wang burned the water heater until 2:45 PM. Because the fire was too strong and the water was insufficient, it suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, Wang's pavilion room completely collapsed, and the brick walls on the north, south, and east sides all collapsed, causing the pavilion rooms of the right-neighboring Jiang Gengji Western Clothing Store at No. 175 and the left-neighboring Yixu Noodles Shop opened by Wang Dalong (47 years old, a Yangzhou native) at No. 179 to collapse as well.</p>

<p>After the water heater exploded, because there were many boxes of gasoline in the house, a fire broke out immediately. The nearby patrolman reported to the police station, which notified the fire brigade to rush to the scene to extinguish the fire and rescue people. The fire was extinguished after about an hour of pouring water. Upon inspection, it was found that four people were killed on the spot, including a male corpse resembling Wang's, Yang Wanxu (21 years old, a Yangzhou native), an apprentice at Guo Yongtai's tin shop, and Wu Gengsheng, a five-year-old child of Wu Yuanlang, a resident of No. 5 Mingde Lane from Anhui.</p>

The above four were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but Wang Guizhang died in the hospital at 9:00 PM due to his injuries. In addition, there were five minor injuries who were sent to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment.</p>

<p>After the tragedy occurred, the police station immediately sent a large number of detectives to quell the situation, investigated the truth of the incident, and summoned many nearby residents for questioning. All four corpses have been transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Home, waiting for the Second Special District Court to send personnel to conduct an autopsy today. At the intersection of Baker Road and Taiping Lane, the robbers urgently opened fire to resist arrest, and the police also fired back. Just as the two sides were fighting, Zhang Qiaoyun (15 years old, from Suzhou), a maid living at No. 36 of the lane, was strolling there, holding her two-year-old master Huang Er'nan (son of Huang Shoutu, an engineer at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory). The child was hit in the left rib by a stray bullet and seriously injured. As a result, the police arrested two robbers, Fu Derong and Wang Zhongyao, on the spot and took them back to the Xinzha Police Station. After the police chief interrogated the robbers, he sent Hua Detectives Wang Qishan and Ye Yushan to the scene to investigate. They immediately sent the injured child to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It has been reported before that the child eventually died of his injuries and could not be saved until 6:10 AM yesterday. The body was moved to the Feilun Road Autopsy Office. At around 10:00 AM, Song Genshan, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and secretary Wang Zuzu, arrived at the office to examine the body. After questioning the deceased's aunt Wang Jingzhen and the maid Zhang Qiaoyun, Song announced that the deceased boy Huang Er'nan was indeed shot and killed. The corpse was handed over to the aunt Wang Jingzhen for burial. It is also understood that the two captured robbers are currently being interrogated and detained by the First Special Court.</p>

<p>As a Result of Hua Commissioner Xi Yushu's Strong Arguments</p>
<p>Cars Remain One-Way, Rickshaws Allowed</p>
<p>Since the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road, it has had a significant impact on the market. Various businesses have closed and moved one after another, resulting in losses. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpayer's Chinese Association, and the Silk Industry Guild have repeatedly fought for its cancellation for four years, but to no avail. Yesterday (the 14th), the Public Works Department reopened the Traffic Committee to discuss the issue. Many Chinese and foreign commissioners attended. On the Chinese side, Hua Commissioner Xi Yushu represented them. The Public Works Department still strongly advocated one-way traffic, saying it was common practice in various cities around the world. The closure of silk shops was due to the depression in the Chinese silk industry and could not be attributed to the implementation of one-way traffic. Furthermore, according to the Donations Office, more shops have closed on Jiujiang Road than on Hankou Road, so it could not be used as a reason to cancel one-way traffic on Hankou Road. However, after Commissioner Xi Yushu repeatedly argued with reason, the decision was made to cancel one-way traffic for chartered cars and rickshaws. This is expected to be implemented soon. In fact, chartered cars and rickshaws have a greater impact on the business of shops than cars. Therefore, the market on Hankou Road is expected to return to its former prosperity.</p>

<p>Suspicious Cracks on the Walls</p>
<p>Since taking office, Director Liang Fuchu of the North Station Public Security Bureau has been extremely diligent in police facilities, discipline rectification, and the arrest of drug dealers, achieving remarkable results. A few days ago, Director Liang suddenly received a tip-off, claiming that the home of Goryeo man Song Shihao at No. 2 Guangshui Lane, North Sichuan Road, had a secret morphine-manufacturing facility that was selling in the city. Director Liang secretly dispatched officers to investigate. After three or four days of investigation, it was confirmed to be true. Yesterday morning, he prepared a document and specifically sent translator Li Weiyuan and palace patrol chiefs Jia and Hong to negotiate with the Japanese consulate and request the cooperation of police officers to conduct a search. With the approval of the Japanese consul, several police officers were assigned to accompany them yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM. At that time, Song Shihao had just gotten up to wash. First, the Japanese police officers explained the situation to him, and then they began the search. They searched all the rooms, but found nothing. However, soon the patrol chiefs saw what appeared to be cracks on the wall next to the downstairs living room. After slightly pushing it, the wall door opened with a creak, resembling a cabinet. Sure enough, what was stored inside was all morphine, and the manufacturing equipment was also fully equipped. Translator Li and others, with the evidence in hand, took the seized morphine, the suspect, and the equipment back to the North Station Branch Bureau. After Director Liang personally interrogated him, he claimed that it was sent by a friend and denied any involvement in drug trafficking or manufacturing. Director Liang then sent a document to the Japanese consulate, transferring Song Shihao to the Japanese consulate for questioning. The seized drugs and equipment were sent to the General Bureau. However, whether the facility has other accomplices is currently under further investigation.</p>

<p>Both Sides Fire a Total of Ten Shots</p>
<p>Three of the Four Robbers Captured</p>
<p>Detective No. 269 of the Putuo Road Police Station suddenly received a tip-off at around 4:00 PM yesterday, claiming that four robbers would rob a shop on Robert Road at around 7:00 PM that evening. After receiving the information, the detective immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched detectives Zhao Bingkun and Tan Jinhai, as well as several armed Hua constables, to lie in ambush near the location and pay attention to passersby. At around 6:50 PM, Detectives Zhao and Tan saw four men wearing long robes walking along the shore towards Caoxiebang in the darkness, acting suspiciously and appearing flustered. The detectives immediately approached them, ordering them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the comers were the four robbers. Upon seeing the detectives emerging from their hiding places, they were greatly shocked and hastily opened fire. The detectives also returned fire. Both sides fired a total of ten shots. The bandits were immediately overwhelmed and attempted to escape. Upon seeing this, Detectives Zhao and Tan bravely stepped forward to pursue and capture three robbers on the spot, seizing a pistol. One robber abandoned a long robe and a pistol by the bank of the river and fled into the darkness. The detectives took the three captured robbers, the two pistols, and the piece of clothing back to the police station. After the police chief interrogated them, they were temporarily detained. The Public Security Bureau was notified to jointly pursue and capture the escaped robber for further investigation. It is understood that a clue has been obtained and the robber is likely to be captured soon.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Lawless Thugs Extort Protection Money <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Five Yuan Not Enough</p>
<p>Excrement Smeared on the Door, Unbearable Odor</p>
<p>Notorious thug Feng Baijing (nicknamed Little Baijing), 35 years old from Wuxi, lives at No. 1 Gongyi Lane, Wanzhu Road. He has gathered a large number of followers in the Jiumu Area, specializing in inducing gambling on floral games, selling red pills, extorting newly opened shops, and committing all kinds of evil deeds. Since the reconstruction of new houses and the opening of new shops in Furun Lane, there have been no less than a hundred. The thug has been demanding large sums of money (commonly known as the "Thirty-Six Parties"), earning a considerable income, but people are afraid of his ferocity and dare not argue with him. Zhang Binru, 52 years old from Nanhui, opened the Tongxin Rice Shop in the area. Because the house was being rebuilt, he moved to the opposite side. Now that the house is completed, he has moved back. Unexpectedly, the thug led his followers to Zhang's shop to demand protection money. Zhang, fearing his power, gave him five yuan. Unexpectedly, the thug said that even a small shop needs at least twenty yuan for protection money, and since you are a big rice shop, you must pay at least one hundred yuan to cross the threshold. Zhang found it difficult to comply. The thug left in a huff, saying, "I will show you what's what within three days." To Zhang's shock, when he opened the door the next morning, the door was covered in excrement, and the odor was unbearable. He then received an anonymous letter stating, "Our brothers have been making a living in Jiumu for a long time by demanding protection money. You must contact us at the First Tea House within three days, otherwise we will take drastic measures." Fearing that something might happen, Zhang immediately reported to the Lao Beimen Police Station. Station Chief Shen immediately dispatched police officer Jiang Yongqing and others in disguise to the First Tea House and arrested the thug Feng Baijing. Under interrogation, he denied any involvement in extortion or illegal activities. The case involves accusations of extortion, intimidation, and disturbance, and will be handed over to the Bureau for handling.</p>

<p>Zheng Tangsheng and Li Quangen Not Guilty</p>
<p>Guard Liu Ruiting Sentenced to Six Months</p>
<p>Zheng Tangsheng, a notorious kidnapper, a local native, was arrested in Tianjin by the French Concession Police in July and brought to Shanghai. After investigation and questioning by the Second Special Court, he was sentenced to death. Zheng refused to accept the sentence and submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which approved the return of the case for a retrial. After several hearings and interrogations, the evidence was still being investigated, and the case had not been concluded. Zheng, along with his accomplices Shang, Liu, Wu, and others,</p>
<p>were detained in the Second Special Court Detention Center. Before the judgment in the first instance, Zheng was detained in the police station and once attempted to commit suicide out of fear of punishment. Fortunately, the guards discovered it early and rescued him, sending him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Now, while Zheng was detained in the detention center, he colluded with Liu Ruiting, a Yangzhou native and clerk of the detention center, to write a letter and attach a map of the detention center. He entrusted Liu to send the letter to Li Quangen, a local native and friend living at No. 16 Renji Road, Pudong, instructing him to prepare pistols, gunpowder, and strong acid in order to plan and implement a prison break. Unfortunately, the plan was leaked, and the French Concession Police discovered it, arresting Li Quangen, seizing the letter and map, and sending them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. At the same time, the detention center was notified to transfer Zheng and the clerk Liu Ruiting to the prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. After the case was tried by Judge Qiu of the Preliminary Court, it was transferred to the Local Court due to the seriousness of the circumstances. The criminal court director Wang Gangxu conducted the trial. The prosecutor and the police lawyer filed a public prosecution against the three defendants for attempted escape, assisting escape, dereliction of duty, and bribery. Defendants Li Quangen and Zheng hired lawyers Shen Xingxia and Ding Yuanpu to defend them. It was declared that the proceedings were concluded and awaiting the verdict. The details have been previously reported. Yesterday was the date</p>
<p>for the pronouncement of the verdict. At 10:00 AM, Director Wang arrived at Criminal Court One, ordering the defendants to be brought to court. Li Quangen and Zheng Tangsheng were found not guilty. Liu Ruiting was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for assisting others in destroying evidence. During the appeal period, he was required to provide a guarantor worth 1,000 yuan. Zheng and Liu were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Defendants Not All Present, No Debate Opened</p>
<p>Head Office Representative Describes Liquidation Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch (No. 130 Ningbo Road) and the Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch (corner of Ma Gao Baolu Road and Avenue Joffre) of the Guangzhou Wu Hua Industrial Bank</p>
<p>suddenly announced their closure on August 21 of this year due to financial difficulties. The head office sent representatives Xu Yuangao, Huang Linsheng, and Yang Yigong to Shanghai to fully liquidate the assets. At the same time, ten depositors and current account holders of the branch, including Zhu Longgen and Luo Lihua, claimed that the branch had not been registered with the Ministry of Finance, had created false pretexts, used advertisements, and promised high interest rates to attract deposits, and had suddenly closed down, which constituted organized fraudulent behavior. They hired lawyers Zhang Shijie, Lou Yunmei, Xu Jie, and Mao Fengwu to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing branch vice presidents Fan Shaoliang, Wang Jian'e, Ye Haitian, Wu Yousan, assistant managers Xie Shunzhi, Tang Songshan, and advisors Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian of fraud and breach of trust, requesting that they be prosecuted according to law. The case has been summoned twice. In addition to Chen Bingqian, who was recuperating in Mogan Mountain and was represented by a lawyer, the other defendants attended the hearing. It was necessary to summon the representatives sent by the head office for full liquidation, and the court ordered a postponement. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday was the date for the continuation of the hearing. At 10:00 AM, Judge Xiong Huiping and clerk Zheng Rongkai opened the trial in the Eighth Court. The plaintiffs and their respective lawyers were present. Except for Xie Shunzhi, Tang Songshan, and Tang Shoumin, the other defendants and their defense lawyers attended the court. First, the plaintiffs briefly stated the intent of the prosecution. The judge then summoned defendant Chen Bingqian to testify, stating that he was an advisor to the bank, did not know the reasons for the closure, and was unaware of the extent of the liquidation. Next, Huang Linsheng, the representative sent by the head office for full liquidation (Xu Yuangao and Yang Yigong were not present), was summoned. Huang stated that he was entrusted by the head office to liquidate the assets in Shanghai. After reviewing the accounts, it was found that the bank owed over 110,000 yuan to people, and owed more than 200,000 yuan to others. It was uncertain when the collection of debts could be completed. As for the liquidation of the accounts, they were working on it and would submit a report within two weeks for verification. At this point, the judge ruled that the defendants were not all present today and could not open the debate. He ordered that a new date be set for the hearing and that Huang Linsheng must submit the liquidation accounts for verification at the next hearing. The court was adjourned.</p>

<p>Increased Police Presence Every Morning</p>
<p>To Help Apprehend Wharf Thugs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Compatriot Association reported that ships arriving from Ningbo often arrive early in the morning, leading to frequent incidents of hooligans robbing passengers in the Xiaodongmen area.

The bureau responded yesterday stating, "We have received your letter regarding women arriving at the wharf being robbed by hooligans near Xiaodongmen. We have been instructed to deploy police patrols in that area every morning to prevent such incidents. This is permissible because police service is continuous, and there is no rule against being on duty in the early morning.

<h3 id="e178">Domestic Goods Industry Concerned About the Issue of Free Gifts with Domestic Cigarettes <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Goods Production and Sales Association Holds Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Regarding the government's ban on free gifts with cigarettes, the Domestic Goods Production and Sales Association reportedly discussed the matter at a meeting yesterday. The general sentiment was that while they should not object to the government's ban, the potential impact needs to be explored. The issue of free gifts may seem minor, but upon closer examination, it warrants discussion. The free gifts attached to cigarettes are mostly small industrial daily-use domestic goods. The monthly demand for these gifts is over one million yuan, and over ten million yuan annually. Many small industrial domestic goods manufacturers rely on this for their livelihood. Domestic cigarette manufacturers struggle to compete with foreign cigarette companies that have deep roots and strong financial resources. Therefore, they resort to offering free gifts as a way to promote sales in the market. With the end of the year approaching and financial conditions tight, a sudden ban on free gifts with cigarettes would directly affect the sales of domestic cigarettes and small industrial daily-use domestic goods, and indirectly affect the entire society. The association is concerned about the domestic goods industry and will reportedly convene a meeting of member tobacco factories to discuss submitting a petition to the authorities to temporarily postpone the ban.</p>

Now that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has issued a letter and public notice regarding the procedures prescribed by the Ministry of Finance's regulations issued on November 8th, we must comply. This office has obtained and printed the regulations and distributed them to each firm. Many firms have applied to this office for assistance in obtaining application forms and registration slips from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and have registered accordingly. However, there are still many who are unfamiliar with the application procedures and have not registered. Given that the registration deadline is rapidly approaching, and we are deeply concerned that members may suffer losses due to missing the deadline, we are writing to remind you to investigate and comply with the regulations to avoid losses and facilitate closure."</p>

<p>Increase Police Patrols at Key Road Intersections</p>
<p>Increase Detective Patrols Day and Night</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizen United Association of Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, wrote to the Chief Inspector of the French Concession Police Department, Mr. (Dong Bolie): "According to a letter from our member store, Dasheng Rice Store, located at 166 and 168 Bailiang Road, at approximately 3:00 AM on the 7th of this month, thieves pried open the rolling doors and stole a bicycle and a metal box. This road is a busy area, yet thieves dare to break into stores and steal. The reason for this is the lack of night patrols. If they are allowed to act with impunity, such incidents will continue to occur daily, leaving merchants with no peace of mind. Therefore, we request that your department forward this letter to the police authorities, requesting them to increase police patrols to ensure security." The matter was brought to the association's attention. In response, the association stated: "Recently, theft has been rampant, and robbery cases have been frequent. During this winter crime prevention period, it is essential to strengthen protection to maintain public order. At its 14th Executive Committee meeting, the association resolved to bring this matter to the attention of the Chief Inspector, requesting that in addition to increasing police patrols at key road intersections, detective patrols should also be increased, patrolling day and night, to maintain security." Therefore, we are sending this letter and requesting that you investigate and take action.</p>

Attendees included Yin Zhiling, Hou Shaoan, Gu Songmao, and others. Yin Zhiling presided over the meeting and reported on recent negotiations with the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Committee. He said that the rickshaw puller registration process is progressing smoothly, with only 3% of applicants failing to meet the requirements, which can still be remedied. He also stated that the lecturers at the registration site did not discuss labor-capital disputes. He expressed satisfaction with the new rickshaw project manufactured by the Rickshaw Manufacturers' Cooperative. Rickshaws that have had new bodies replaced since this month should be replaced with old-style new bodies as agreed. The meeting then discussed the following motions:</p>

<p>Ancient Bronze Buddha and Sutras on Palm Leaves Are Priceless Treasures</p>
<p>Seized Together with the Property of Hongshan Temple</p>
<p>The abbot of Longhua Temple, Monk Xingkong, and the steward, Lu Mingzhao, sued the former abbot, Monk Yuanzhao, in the local court for infringing on temple property. Prosecutor Wu Deying investigated and filed a lawsuit, which was publicly tried. Due to the exceptional complexity of the case, a retrial was ordered. The details of the interrogation have been reported previously. It is now known that Pan Zhensheng, the lawyer privately hired by Xingkong, has submitted a</p>
<h3 id="e186">Supplementary Civil Lawsuit <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>regarding 35 mu of tidal land that was stolen and sold by Yuanzhao to Jisheng Association, obtaining a price of 9,500 yuan; also 10 mu of farmland within the 27th Bao that was stolen and sold to Pushan Villa, obtaining a price of 3,000 yuan; also 25 mu that was stolen and sold to the Jinhui Hall and Quanzhou Hall, obtaining a price of over 10,000 yuan; also 15 mu of vacant land on the Jade Belt River that was stolen and sold to the Buddhist Charity Association, obtaining a price of 8,000 yuan; also 40 mu of farmland within the 9th Tu that was stolen and sold by Yuanzhao, using the alias Chai Zhiming, to Chen Chunyang, obtaining a price of over 10,000 yuan; also over 20 mu of farmland in the Lita Village and Zhu Jing areas of Jinshan County that was stolen and sold, obtaining a price of over 1,000 yuan; also 7 palm leaf scriptures, all in Sanskrit and of great value, were also stolen and sold, with the proceeds embezzled; also an ancient bronze Buddha, which came from India and is over 2,000 years old, and of considerable value, was also stolen and sold. In total, Yuanzhao stole and sold 115 mu of real estate. The plaintiffs request that the court order the land to be recovered and managed by Longhua Temple as usual. As for the palm leaf scriptures and the ancient bronze Buddha, the plaintiffs request that the court order Yuanzhao to compensate for the losses of</p>
<h3 id="e187">100,000 Yuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since Yuanzhao was taken into custody, another monk, Minfeng, also filed a complaint with the court's prosecutor's office, accusing Yuanzhao of encroaching on the temple property of Hongshan Temple, located west of Dananmen, across from the Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road. The investigation was also clear, and a lawsuit was jointly filed with the criminal court. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Judge Shao Qinzhi continued the trial in the Third Court. First, Monk Minfeng testified, stating that he was 37 years old and from Huangyan. He had previously become a monk at Hongshan Temple under his jurisdiction. The judge asked, "In what year did Yuanzhao become the abbot of Hongshan Temple?" He replied, "In 1927. Yuanzhao was appointed abbot." The judge asked, "Who appointed him as abbot?" He replied, "The old monk Guangjian appointed him." The judge asked, "When was Hongshan Temple built?" He replied, "It was built by the old monk by begging for donations while knocking on a wooden fish. At that time, the city walls had not yet been demolished." The judge asked, "Whose land is the temple built on?" He replied, "The temple's own. Previously, the land deed was entrusted by the old monk to the family of Mo Zijing of Dananmen for safekeeping. Later, not long after the old monk passed away, Yuanzhao retrieved the</p>
<h3 id="e188">Land Deed <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>In 1930, I went on a pilgrimage. Upon my return to Shanghai, I saw that all the Buddha statues in the temple had been moved to Longhua by Yuanzhao. I went to negotiate, and Yuanzhao replied that because the market was not good, it would be better to build houses on the land for rent. Therefore, I immediately informed the benefactor Lin Kanghou, who summoned Yuanzhao to his home for questioning. Yuanzhao continued to evade the issue. Currently, over twenty houses have been rebuilt on the temple land, and Yuanzhao's nephew-in-law, Yan Wanglong, is collecting rent (Yan lives at No. 2 Fuanli, which was rebuilt on the temple land). The judge asked, "What are you requesting in your supplementary civil lawsuit?" He replied, "I request that Yuanzhao move all the Bodhisattvas back to their original location, and that all the houses be returned to Hongshan Temple." The judge asked for the</p>
<h3 id="e189">Accused Yuanzhao to be Brought to the Case <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The judge asked, "What is the situation of the Hongshan Temple land?" He replied, "The temple land is the property of Yan Wanglong's ancestors, Yan Hengli." The judge asked, "Where is the ancient Buddha and the seven palm leaf scriptures of Longhua Temple?" He replied, "The ancient bronze Buddha is still there. As for the palm leaf scriptures, they were stored in the back cabinet, and whether they are lost or not is unknown." The judge ordered Xingkong to be brought to the case. He testified that according to Yuanzhao, the ancient bronze Buddha that is still there is a Kunhu Buddha made in China. Now it has been found that the lost ancient bronze Buddha is a Prince Buddha, which came from a foreign country. After the judge obtained the testimony, he said to Lawyer Pan, "Yuanzhao's appeal to the Suzhou Higher Court on the civil case will be heard soon. All the case files are in the Higher Court. We will not hold a debate today, but will wait to summon more witnesses. Yuanzhao will be returned to custody and the matter will be discussed later." 1) Jin Chunlin proposed whether the 350 old-style new rickshaw bodies that have been agreed upon should be stamped or certified. Decision: They should be stamped. 2) Hou Shaoan proposed that the start-up costs of the Joint Manufacturing Factory should be collected by Tonghe Bank on a temporary basis starting today and deposited in the Kenye Bank. Decision: Accountant Hou should be responsible for remitting the funds to Kenye Bank daily. 3) Wang Kunyi proposed that since the Joint Manufacturing Factory has started construction of new rickshaws, the manufacturing committee should take turns supervising the work. Decision: Notify committee members Wang, Cai, and Lu to take note. 4) Gu Songmao reported on the progress of the proposal to the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Society to provide relief to rickshaw pullers, and the rickshaw pullers' representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the Mutual Aid Society's requirement for rickshaw owners to provide universal relief to rickshaw pullers. Decision: Yin Zhiling, Gu Songmao, and Hou Shaoan were appointed to design a universal relief plan.</p>

<p>Mr. Lu Erkui, a scholar of modern dictionary studies, previously served as the editor-in-chief of Ciyuan at the Commercial Press. He devoted himself wholeheartedly for many years and compiled the dictionary, which was widely popular in China and benefited countless students. However, Mr. Lu suffered an eye ailment as a result and retired at home. He relied on his son, the famous physician Lu Lusha, who took care of him wholeheartedly, allowing him to live out his natural life. On the 2nd of this month, he passed away due to waist cancer at his residence. At that time, his old friends such as Wu Zhihui and Xu Xiaotian considered Mr. Lu to be one of the few modern scholars and planned to initiate a memorial service.

<h3 id="e194">Xing Zhigang's Request to Restore the Old Militia System <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the district head of the fifth district of Shanghai County, yesterday submitted a petition to the county government, requesting the restoration of the original county's local militia system. He humbly requested that the government, based on the situation, forward the request to the provincial authorities for approval in order to maintain local security. He stated that during the 38th district affairs meeting held on the 14th of this month, it was unanimously agreed that the county, in April, had reorganized the militia based on a provincial order. The order stipulated that the collected militia funds would be centrally managed by the county, and the original local volunteer militiamen would be disbanded and replaced with newly recruited local militia members who would be trained in rotation by the county. However, at that time, the villagers were in the midst of the busy farming season, and most were unable to respond to the call, leading to the recruitment of guest laborers to fill the ranks. Subsequently, due to the fact that the treatment was handled according to the conscription system, some local young men could not endure the hardship and dispersed. In October, the organization was again reorganized into the provincial security force, and its organizational structure became more cumbersome. This has distanced the force further and further from the purpose of protecting the local area, and all collected funds have been intercepted and allocated separately. A small number of militiamen are used to perfunctorily patrol the area. Since the beginning of winter, theft cases have occurred repeatedly, indicating that local security is not being maintained. With such a small number of militiamen, maintaining security is like trying to cover everything while missing key areas. Knowledgeable individuals have considered establishing watch posts, but there are no funds available to cover expenses such as oil and candles, leaving them with nothing but sighs and lamentations. The official investigation found that in the past five years, the district has relied on the local militia for effective protection, and there have been no theft alerts. Since the disbandment, theft cases have occurred frequently. Furthermore, according to the Pudong Star News, over one hundred cases of theft, kidnapping, and robbery have occurred in the neighboring Fengxian County in the past two months, which is truly shocking. Even in the Puxi area of this county, theft cases have been repeatedly discovered, indicating that the provincial security force is weak and unable to maintain security. Moreover, the local people believe that the responsibility for security rests with the provincial security force, and therefore neglect precautions, allowing bandits to run rampant without any restraint, which is a major problem for the local area. It is now proposed to earnestly request the county government to report the true situation of local decay to the provincial authorities and promptly issue an order to restore the original county's local militia system, returning the originally collected funds to allow for reorganization and defense of the area. These matters were recorded, and therefore, the official earnestly submits this petition to the higher authorities for review and approval, so as to comply with public sentiment and assist in public safety. The official would be immensely grateful.</p>

<p>Eventually won four to three.</p>
<p>Last week, in the Western League Division A football match between Tung Wah and Shaguer, Tung Wah barely won four to two. Yesterday, Yoyo and Shaguer also played a Division A match at the Recreation Ground. Yoyo only won four to three, and in the last fifteen minutes, there was a strong possibility of a draw. Shaguer's tenacity was evident. Yesterday's lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>

<p>▲Yoyo scored three goals in a row.</p>
<p>After the referee Marshall blew the whistle to start the game, Shaguer launched an attack, but was repelled by Yoyo. Mao Hongfa fired a shot towards the center, but Shen Shiqi failed to head it in, which was a pity. After ten minutes of melee, Zhong Tongseng dribbled the ball in swiftly and passed it into the center. Sun Jinshun rushed in from behind, raised his iron leg, and swept it fiercely at the goal, scoring in one fell swoop. In the twentieth minute, Mao Hongfa was blocked by Ke Xuemofu in front of the goal. Ke suddenly tripped over the ball, but it was just on the penalty line, so no penalty kick was awarded. Although Sun Jinshun's kick was powerful, it flew over the goalpost. At twenty-five minutes, Shaguer caused a disturbance in front of the goal. Tang Ji came out to defend, and Shaguer's ball bounced back off the goalpost, which was also dangerous. However, in the last two minutes of the first half, Mao Hongfa scored, making it two to zero.</p>
<p>▲沙谷頑强反抗</p>
<p>▲Shaguer fought back tenaciously.</p>
<p>Three minutes into the second half, Luo Haiguang received a ball from the right and headed it in, giving Yoyo a three-goal lead. Under Yoyo's intensified pressure, Sun Jinshun and Shen Shiqi each had a fierce shot, but unfortunately missed. After fifteen minutes, the Russians launched a full-scale attack. Goalkeeper Tang Shoumen was caught out of position while trying to deal with it, causing a mishap and allowing Na Shi Taiwen to score. Five minutes later, Loba Stowe swept the ball into the goal from twenty yards out on the left, with great speed and beauty, making it three to two. In the last ten minutes, although Sun Jinshun scored again, Mi Hailuofu also shot a long-range ball, which went over Tang Ji's head and into the net, resulting in a final score of four to three.</p>

<p>The Nanjing Central University football team came to Shanghai a few days ago to play in the Jiangda Sports Association football matches with Guanghua and Jinan. The team is quite strong and once defeated Chih Chih 10-1, losing only 1-2 to Fudan. Yesterday, the team first played Guanghua University on Great Western Road. Guanghua's strength this year is quite considerable and is enough to be a strong opponent for Jinan and Fudan. Therefore, although Central was strong, it conceded defeat to Guanghua with a score of 1-4.</p>

<p>雙方競爭頗烈、表演尙佳、上半時由光華蔣紹祥攻入中央一球、以一比零勝、休息後、董叔昭又建一攻、光華攻勢極盛、中央招架爲難、應付不遑、急切間鄧堪舜（中央）犯規、被罰十二碼球、被光華夏建國踢中、成三與零之比、</p>
<p>The competition between the two sides was quite fierce and the performance was good. In the first half, Jiang Shaoxiang of Guanghua scored a goal against Central, winning 1-0. After the break, Dong Shuzhao scored another goal. Guanghua's offensive was very strong, and Central found it difficult to parry and cope. In a moment of desperation, Deng Kanshun (Central) committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty kick, which was scored by Xia Jianguo of Guanghua, making the score 3-0.</p>
<h3 id="e214">奪回一球 <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>Central, in a rage, tried to counterattack, hoping to recover its lost ground, making the competition even more intense. Wu Shunwen finally scored a goal for Guanghua, breaking the duck's egg record. Guanghua continued its momentum, and its strict offense and defense kept Central's players at a disadvantage. Finally, Jiang Shaoxiang of Guanghua scored another goal, making the final score 4-1. Tomorrow morning, Central will play Jinan.</p>

<p>Two cases from the Ministry of Education regarding the interpretation of education laws and regulations: ㈠ Regarding the inquiry from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education about whether current teachers and staff of private schools can concurrently serve as school board members, the directive stated that current teachers and staff of private schools may also concurrently serve as school board members of their schools.

Approved. Upon investigation, the expenses of the joint elementary school of the two counties are derived from both counties, so it should be named "Joint Elementary School of XX and XX Counties." The jurisdiction, such as supervision and guidance, should be presided over by the county government whose seat is closer to the school. Regarding important matters of the school, such as expansion, closure, appointment and dismissal of the principal, handling of school property, and budget review, it should still be handled through consultation between the educational administrative organs of the two counties in accordance with Article 1 of the General Outline for the Organization of Joint Primary and Secondary School Boards, etc.</p>

<p>▲Telegraphic Order to the Education Bureaus of Shanghai and Other Counties ▲Supervise and Order Students to Regularly Clean Their Homes The Shanghai County Education Bureau received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education yesterday, stating: "Regarding the Provincial Government's Secret Order No. 2042, promoting cleanliness and neatness is one of the essences of the New Life Movement, and the implementation of this movement should be extended from individuals to families. Young students are the intellectual elements of the future and the backbone of society. This good habit should be cultivated as early as possible in order to invigorate the spirit and reverse the decadent customs. As the year is coming to an end, it should be stipulated that on the 22nd and 23rd of this month, all students over the age of ten should help with the tidying and cleaning of their homes, and have a half-day holiday on the afternoon of the 22nd. All schools should supervise and order students to comply, and must not be opportunistic, evasive, or perfunctory. In addition to providing early guidance to students on the methods of tidying and cleaning their homes, the principals and teachers of all schools may also go to inspect their achievements as much as possible the next day. Those with outstanding achievements may be given additional points in their year-end performance appraisal to encourage them. As the deadline is approaching and remote counties may not have enough time to issue instructions, we will first telegraph the order for implementation, so that there is sufficient time to prepare. This is the order." Accordingly, in addition to issuing separate telegraphic orders, we hereby telegraph you to earnestly comply and report the implementation situation.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Gold Market Breaks Through 60 Yuan Mark Again on Last Day of January Period <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Swap Premium Increases Without Decrease</p>
<p>Resulting in Another Fall of 4 Yuan 3 Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market has been weak for consecutive days. The buying forces have been crumbling due to the influence of swaps to a miserable extent. Yesterday's market fell below the 960 Yuan mark because it was the last trading day of January. The selling pressure was overwhelming. Initially, the overseas silver market and the US market were flat. The forward silver price in Montevideo fluctuated. The exchange rate rose slightly. The price of London raw gold rose by half a penny. The off-market preliminary trading opened, and the bid was once 64.5 Yuan. Because the swap premium had already dropped to around 13.5 Yuan, the large short positions slightly added to their positions. However, the bulls were still panicked and closed their positions at high prices. Coupled with Juchang's vigorous selling efforts, the buying forces collapsed all at once, and the supply exceeded the demand, breaking through the 60 Yuan mark. The Central Bank's exchange rate was flat for both British and American currencies. The customs gold unit rose by one li. The standard gold price was quoted at 1005.8 Yuan. The market stabilized after the opening, struggling around 60 Yuan. Although the swap premium gradually increased afterward, the sellers temporarily watched from the sidelines due to the efforts of large players to purchase, and their power prevailed. Although the banks filled bills of exchange, the HSBC's exchange rate rose by 1.25 for British currency and 0.25 for American currency, which did not have a significant impact. People's minds were stable, and the gold market hovered and rose. However, because the supply was very diligent at taking advantage of the high prices, the price gradually declined again after the rise. The official opening saw the long positions quoting 14.9 Yuan. The silver balance tax was revealed, rising by 2.5 li, with a collection of 6.5%. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 5625, which was still rebounding. However, the rising wind was temporary, and most buyers tended to sell. Soon, the price trended downward. However, because the exchange market was normal, there were many struggles in the middle. Ultimately, the swap continued to rise higher and higher, and the supply exceeded the demand in the market, breaking through the 60 Yuan mark. Although large players bought at low prices, there was slight hovering. Finally, the long positions quoted more than 15.5 Yuan. The floating long positions that were unwilling to swap had no choice but to close their positions with pain because today was the last trading day of January. As a result, the selling pressure was overwhelming and the price fell to 958.3 Yuan. The price gradually rebounded after the market closed. The last trading was sparse. The premium once fell to 11.5 Yuan, and the gold price also fell to 62-63 Yuan. Currently, there are more than 11,000 remaining January period notes. The total number of February period notes is 20,000. Many large short positions rolled over their positions. The swap situation was not as bad as expected. In this swap session, the market quoted from 14.4 Yuan to 15.8 Yuan from the short positions. The half-day market situation is recorded below. The morning opening was 959.9 Yuan, a further drop of 3.1 Yuan compared to the previous close. Fuxingyong and Dafa Yong rose to 0.07 Yuan. Retail investors sold. Dingkang also sold. The Bank came out with January US dollar at 34.25, and the price dropped to 59.5 Yuan. Dadacheng, Fuxingyong, Xiangfeng, Dafayong, Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, Yuanheng, and Fuan joined forces to take delivery. Macali picked up February shilling at 4375. People's minds were quite stable, gradually rising to 63.8 Yuan. HSBC's exchange rate was revealed, with British currency rising by 1.25 and American currency rising by 0.25, retreating to 2.7 Yuan. Fuxingyong, Dafayong, Qianchangxiang, etc. continued to purchase, gradually rising to 4.2 Yuan. Yuqingyong, Dafayong, and Wanchangyong jointly sold notes, falling to 3.1 Yuan. Not long after, January US dollar at 1875, the bank wanted to close the session. Yifengyong, Dafayong, Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, etc. bought notes, and the price rose to 4.7 Yuan. Fuxingyong and Hengyu sold notes. Yuanshengyong still made progress. Although there was struggling, Dadacheng and Qianchangxiang sold notes diligently, and the price still retreated to 2.2 Yuan. The silver balance tax revealed a rise of 2.5 li, with a tax of 6.5%. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 5625. Hengtai still made progress, once rebounding to 4.1 Yuan. After all, the swap premium rose step by step. The swap opened with the sellers quoting 14.9 Yuan. People's minds were finally timid. Xiangfeng, Dingtai, Dakang, Shunmao, and Hengxing sold, and the price fell to 1 Yuan. Youli picked up February shilling at 4375. Yuanmaoyong and Dadacheng worked hard to take delivery, rising to 2.6 Yuan. People's minds were still trending downward. Many floating long positions were cut, and the price still declined. Fuxingyong, Futaiheng, Jiatai, etc. sold notes one after another, breaking through the 60 Yuan mark, falling to 59.5 Yuan. The exchange market had no impact. Hengyu, Dadacheng, and Qianchangxiang continuously took delivery, and the price rebounded to 61.5 Yuan. However, the swap rose to more than 15 Yuan. Most bulls had no choice but to close their positions. Because the January period notes were approaching the final date, Xinchan, Ruikang, Fuxingyong, and Jiatai supplied notes, and the price fell to 58.5 Yuan. Hengyu, etc. bought aggressively at low prices, once rebounding to 60.5 Yuan. Jiatai, Fuxingyong, Yukang, and Dakang still sold. Retail investors pressed hard, and the price fell to 58.3 Yuan. Although Yuanmaoyong made progress to 9.4 Yuan, Yukang, etc. still sold, and the price fell to 8.3 Yuan again. The midday close was 958.7 Yuan. After the market closed, although Yukang and Changda sold to 8.2 Yuan, Hengxing, Hengyu, Tongtaichang, Dadacheng, etc. continued to take delivery. The swap premium suddenly became cheaper, rising to over 60 Yuan. The last trading was already sparse, and the premium even fell to 11.5 Yuan, and the gold market also rose to 62-63 Yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 964.7 Yuan, and the lowest price was 958.3 Yuan, with a difference of 6.4 Yuan. The result was a fall of 4.3 Yuan compared to the previous close. The closing price was quoted by the Central Bank's standard gold price at 1005.8 Yuan, which was approximately 47 Yuan lower than the closing price, a stronger decline of 4 Yuan compared to the previous close. The January registration price was 959 Yuan, and the February price was 975 Yuan. The morning make-up water was 950 Yuan. The fine gold was still at the same price as the forward gold, quoted at 959.9 Yuan. The swap market started, and there were no transactions heard in the spot market. The market continued to be calm. Although Tianjin goods were priced at 3 Yuan more than the forward gold, the spot market had a buying appetite due to the decline in standard gold, roughly with an additional 4 Yuan, there were still buyers, but no formal transactions were seen. The market trading was chaotic, and the transactions were not seen to be prosperous. This was also due to the swap relationship. In summary, Fuxingyong, Shunmao, Jiatai, Yukang, Dingqi, Xinchan, Hengxing, etc. were on the selling side. Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Wanxing, Yuanheng, Guli, Yuanshengyong, Fuan, etc. were on the buying side. Yuanmaoyong and Dadacheng sold first and then bought. Fuxingyong and Dafayong bought first and then sold. The Dalian gang Wanxing did a total of more than 200 notes, and the positions were slightly advanced. Shunli did less than 200 notes in total, and advanced by more than 100 notes. The Guangdong gang was generally flat. Hengxing advanced less and sold more. The total number of transactions on that day, including swaps, was 71,134 notes. The swap (January to February period) continued to be pre-made after 8:30 AM yesterday morning. Initially, the short positions quoted 14.5 Yuan. Qianchangxiang, Dadacheng, Yuanyi, Qingfayong, Fuan, etc. immediately came to quote. The long positions were very few, retreating to 13.56 Yuan. Yuanmaoyong vigorously quoted. Bingxing, Dachangxiang, Fuyu, Yongli, Chunyong, Fuxingyong, Tianfengyong, Qinyu, etc. also jointly quoted, gradually pulling up. By the time the official quotation was posted at 10 o'clock, it was widely hyped that the sellers were quoting 14.9 Yuan. Qianchangxiang, Hengchangyong, Dakang, Huixiang, and Fuan came to quote, retreating to 14.23 Yuan. The lowest quotation was 14.4 Yuan. Fuxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Tianfeng quoted and were calm. Afterwards, Yuanmaoyong suddenly advanced and exited. Dadacheng, Fuyu, Chunyuanyong, Yicheng, Zhengchang, etc. repeatedly quoted, even rising to 15 Yuan. This price was only quoted by Qingfayong to Runchangyu for 14 notes. Because Runchangyu, Fuxing, Futaiheng, Yuqingyong, Huixiangyicheng, and Yongfeng needed to close their positions, the situation was difficult to resolve. Later, Zhengchang came to quote vigorously, and the price rose to more than 15 Yuan. Zhengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Dadacheng, etc. quoted one after another, and the price rose again. The last transaction was sparse. Jinlong and Hengtai worked hard to quote, and the price even rose to around 16 Yuan. The highest quotation was 15.8 Yuan. Chunyuanyong, etc. quoted, and the midday close was the sellers quoting 15.5 Yuan. After the market closed, Jiatai, Xianghe, and Yuanmaoyong quoted, retreating to less than 15 Yuan.

<p>The Central Bank's listed rates were announced, with both sterling and the dollar flat, and the customs gold unit rising by one li. Chinese merchants' sentiment was still good, and although banks were tight, they could still support the market.</p>
<p>The HSBC's listed rates were announced, with sterling up 125 points and the US dollar up 25 points. Although there were speculative positions, the market tightened due to the efforts of Chinese merchants to buy in, and the banks also bought back. However, the tightening trend was hindered by the continued influx of those supplying at high prices.</p>
<p>The silver balancing tax was announced to be up 25 points, calculated at 6.5 percent, with sterling calculated at one shilling, five pence, and five six two five points. The situation was then set. After that, Chinese merchants, constrained by unfavorable gold exchange rates, turned softer in sentiment, and there was a slight loosening, but there were no special changes.</p>
<p>At noon closing, the near-term selling price for sterling was one shilling, four pence, nine three seven five points, or eight seven five points, and the US dollar was thirty-four yuan, eight seven five points, which was flat for sterling and .0625 tighter for the dollar compared to the previous closing. Banks and Chinese merchants had moderate appetites, and sentiment was mediocre. A small squeeze on the Chinese banks bought about 300,000 US dollars, while sterling was both bought and sold.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Foreign Interbank Call Loan Rates Up Another Two Points <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Year-end settlements are concluding one after another.</p>
<p>The financial industry is gradually becoming busier.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign interbank call loans in the market increased by two points compared to the previous day, calculated at two jiao and five fen, while the premium for extending loans was as high as one jiao and five fen. Although the mid-point was one jiao, the overall demand was uneven, resulting in a consistently high price.</p>
<p>Based on the current market situation, there is no possibility of easing. The trading volume of call loan bills was over 3.4 million in the morning session, with new transactions over 400,000. The trading volume in the afternoon session was over 600,000. Transactions in the Small General Association were over 800,000. The amount of banknotes recovered was over 1.4 million, and the amount of circulating notes issued was over 1.7 million, with over 900,000 secret-marked notes.</p>
<p>The transaction volume of foreign pawn loans redeemed was over 1.1 million, with new loans made over 900,000, and the source of customers was 400,000, with 250,000 going to the bank.</p>
<p>Banks on the Bund are slow in their procedures due to the large volume of year-end settlements. Yesterday, there were another 1.8 million in year-end settlements, and Japanese banks also had 1.3-1.4 million. However, yesterday was Saturday, and banks on the Bund were closed as usual, so the situation was still somewhat unclear. Otherwise, the scene of busyness would be even more bustling.</p>
<p>Foreign banks received and cleared over 3.8-3.9 million in bill payments, over 5.1 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and collateral tax payments, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, over 400,000 in special remittances, and 600,000 in withdrawals.</p>
<p>Chinese banks received and cleared over 3.5-3.6 million in bill payments, over 5.8 million in various goods, foreign exchange, collateral tax payments, and other payments, over 1.1 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, over 700,000 in special remittances, over 1 million in year-end settlements, and 900,000 in warehouse deposits.</p>
<p>Japanese banks received and cleared over 2.7-2.8 million in bill payments, over 5.1 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and other payments, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, over 700,000 in special remittances, and 500,000 in warehouse deposits.</p>
<p>Money shops received and cleared over 52 million in foreign public orders, over 11 million in foreign premiums, over 600,000 in various remittances, and 7-800,000 in cash settlements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total exchange volume of the local clearing house on the 15th was 13,159,721.53 silver dollars, including 4,018,299.85 silver dollars in silver coins and 9,141,421.68 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Guangdong Small Coins Expensive, Transactions Brisk <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>▲Copper coins short another 4,500 cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign coins were priced at 840 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions, the same as the previous day. The trading volume was only 4,000 jiao in the morning session. However, the Guangdong small foreign coins were indeed very expensive, increasing by 4-5 yuan compared to the previous day. The morning session was priced at 754.7 yuan, and the afternoon session was priced at 757.2 yuan. As a result, it was a significant increase of 4.6 yuan compared to the afternoon session of the previous day. The trading volume was also exceptionally high, with 185,000 jiao in the morning session and as much as 200,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Due to the high demand for copper coins, there was a shortage of 4,500 cash, priced at 304,000 cash, with 30,000 strings and 6,480 bundles traded, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Securities Float High, Painful Cuts, Public Bonds Fall Sharply <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>▲One-day plunge of several jiao to one yuan and four jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange deteriorated further, and the selling pressure intensified. Large investors were increasingly eager to sell, and retail investors were also selling off their long positions, mostly taking painful cuts. The atmosphere in the market was still calm, and although there were rumors, they could not be verified. The slight increase in foreign oaths had little impact. However, the outflow from sellers was indeed unpredictable. The Fifth Plenary Session had already closed, and most of the expectations of long positions were disappointed. Financial circles said that new public bonds would be issued, so banks were selling off their existing bonds to prepare for the new public bonds. Retail investors became more and more restless, and market prices fell more and more sharply. Due to the relationship between long position swaps, forward prices rose higher and higher, and the future remained difficult to be optimistic about. However, if sellers stopped even slightly, market prices could easily soar, so be cautious.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market opened in the morning, and the index immediately plunged by more than half a yuan, which was sold short by No. 11, and the general trend was gone, and the price plummeted. The 20-volume fell sharply by seven jiao and a half. In the next session, the number of leading sellers suddenly decreased, and the market rebounded by three or four jiao. Since the implementation of the consolidated tax, No. 11, 20 and 38 and other sellers have sold a lot, and then turned into a decline, and then a small three or four jiao. The index became more and more shaken, and the consolidated tax fell sharply by nine jiao. The situation became more and more bad, as if a great disaster was about to come. In fact, it was still a relationship with silver shortage. The reporter has repeatedly explained this. Yesterday's market price result was a sharp drop of several jiao to one yuan and four jiao. The total transaction volume was 26.39 million. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (14th), the New York stock market was stagnant and mixed.

Retail stocks continued to rise, utility stocks were quiet, and bonds were mixed except for special advances. Small exchange stocks were mixed with gains. The total daily trading volume was 930,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>After the sharp drop in the yarn market the previous day, yesterday it rebounded slightly. However, buyers in the market were not active, because a certain merchant had the intention of observing the lower prices, and the market price was still under pressure. In addition, the large amount of yarn of the Tongcheng Company did not move. On the one hand, it is said that 1,200 bales of 20-count Fugui yarn, which were received last month, have been transferred to other shops, and 750 bales have been shipped to Hankou for sale. The market sentiment has slightly improved.</p>

<p>After the large drop in the previous day, the new selling pressure in the spot yarn market shrank in the morning session, and Japanese merchants also made no moves, prompting profit-takers to cover their positions. The market rebounded slightly, with each month rising by 4, 5, and 6 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were still stable and good, but Japanese yarn prices fell again, so the market atmosphere remained flat, with each month rising or falling by 1 and 2 jiao. It was found that Da Feng sold 600 bales, Da Chang 650 bales, Yongchang 850 bales, Shen Ji 300 bales, and Run Kang 1,200 bales.

<p>Because the American cotton market rose, the cotton market atmosphere rose slightly, prompting profit-takers to cover their positions. Japanese merchants also did not sell, so the market showed a stable trend. At the same time, the yarn market was stable after the drop, so people's hearts were still good. However, Yuan Dahao was still selling short.</p>

<p>In the morning opening of the spot cotton market, due to the rise in US cotton by five points and the mixed rise and fall in Indian cotton, the selling pressure in the market was not strong. After the large drop in the previous day, most people were watching the situation. So the market atmosphere was still calm, and Japanese merchants also did not move.

<p>US Cotton October Futures Most Bullish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened. Except for the December futures, which were slightly weak due to the delivery notice reaching 700 bales, the prices of other months were firm due to purchases by counterparties and short covering. Shortly after the opening, the amount of credit given to the government was resold, and cotton farmers and local merchants also had hedge sales, with slight reactions. Finally, due to the public's support for continuing the Pyncheon case, October futures were purchased one after another, and market prices rose again. Selling stored cotton was easily absorbed, and the closing trend was very firm. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 1 to 18 points. UK spot cotton fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by market operators and Japanese merchants. Bengal rose by 2.5 jiao, Omra fell by 2.5 jiao, and Berar Creek rose by 0.5 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (14th telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month's market showed a trend of rising first and then falling. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago rose by about 2 jiao, and in Canada it rose by about 1-2 jiao. When the price was opened, the market for each month was very good due to the strong buying from outside the industry, continuing to be good by about 1 point. After the second session, because the new buyers stopped, the old bulls closed many positions because the settlement was approaching, and the market for each month gradually fell. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trend of this month turned fixed, because the Tianjin gang still had a need for spot goods. It was heard that the warship called out 5 jiao and 4 fen, and 50,000 bags were traded by the artillery car, priced at 5 jiao and a half, but it still needs to be confirmed by telegram. As for the forward months, the market gradually fell because the factory also had hedge sales. The market in recent days has risen and fallen frequently, and the manufacturer's chips must be shifted to the fixed-price foreign wheat, otherwise, if the empty chips are scarce, the market will still turn stable. As a result, this month fell by 1 fen and 2.5 li, January fell by 2 fen, February fell by 1 fen and 7.5 li, March fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li, April fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li, and May fell by 2.5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the market in each month showed a calm state. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago rose by about 2-4 jiao, and in Canada it rose by about 1-2 jiao. When the price was opened, the trading volume in each month was still not smooth. It was raised by 1-2 fen at the beginning, but then there were not many buyers, and it fell by 1-2 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere in each month had turned flat and soft, because each was tired, the buyers were not strong, and the opening price was soft. Observation, the day is approaching to settlement, trading is difficult to expect to be lively, I am afraid it will have to stop for a while. As a result, this month did not move, January fell by 4 fen, February fell by 4 fen, and March fell by 5 fen. The spot wheat market is generally smooth and stable, and 1,500 bags of Liuhe wheat were opened at 4 yuan and 3 fen, and Chongming wheat at 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen, which were handled by Hua Feng.</p>
<p>▲Chicago Wheat</p>
<p>The market is narrow, and there are some purchases. The spot position is firm. Australian wheat can be used to make wheat for about 120 million bushels. The estimate of A wheat has increased, but the quality is not good.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market conditions continued to see two small batches of Siamese and Annam rice arriving, but the appetite in the mainland was very weak, and the street was also watching, because the number of loading and unloading days has been high, and recently the year-end closing is approaching, and the circulation of silver is also hindered, so the customer appetite is light. Yesterday, the Tongshi market only had this street going to Saigon for 1,500 bags, Anmian Japonica rice and Siamese rice for 300 bags, and the mainland only went to Gao Siamese rice for 200 bags, and there were no other transactions. The futures prices did not fall, and the importers wanted to press down the price, and then rejected the opening. Rongxian arrived and stored two charges. Yesterday, 1,800 bags were handled by this art to the mainland, although the price was too expensive and they were unwilling to sell, but the market was also flat and soft.</p>

<p>(Hunan) Yesterday, all capitals came as before, with a total of more than 40 boats (a total of more than 7,000 shi of goods). Because the weather was cloudy and thundery, people's hearts were slightly settled. More than 400 bags of late rice and green birds continued to be sold in the market, and the market was not very prosperous. Because more goods arrived, the phenomenon presented a situation of stability with softness. Among them, the market price was reduced by several cents to Jiao Xu. Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan, etc., each variety, the road also belongs to the ordinary, so the market is still weak and depressed.</p>

Jiangbei only has 10-20%, so since the new one came out, the price increase has been quite rapid. At the moment, most of the sources are Tianjin Dalian, and the route is mainly to Xiaoluzong, followed by Guangdong, Xiazhou, and Ningbo. The Yantai gang's price is too high and the cost does not match, so there are no transactions. Recently, Tianjin nutmeg has been opened to 5 yuan and 4 jiao and 8</p>

<p>Recently, although the off-take of dried lily flowers in Guangdong and Fujian has been slow, the inventory of each business is low, and the intention to purchase is very strong. Both the posted and landed prices are very tight, leading to a gradual increase in the quoted price. Yesterday, the transaction volume among firms was one hundred and several tens of packages. Top-grade Zhuangcai (莊菜) was priced at 20.5 to 20 yuan, Daxingcai (大興菜) at 19.5 yuan, Yanghuacai (仰花菜) at 18 yuan, and Xuzhoucai (徐州菜) at 17.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan to 8 jiao compared to the previous trading day.

<p>For 24- to 28-gauge tinplate, yarn factories have been actively purchasing lately, and candle factories have also increased their purchases. As a result, the standard is very robust. For example, 24-gauge is sold at 75 yuan per box, up 3 yuan from before; 26-gauge is at 65 yuan, also up 2 yuan; and 28-gauge is at 54.5 yuan, also an increase of about 1 yuan. It is noted that more than ten boxes were sold yesterday, but the market supply is very thin, and market sentiment is exceptionally good, so the retail prices are also firm. For example, 24-gauge is sold at an increase of 1 yuan and 6.5 jiao per piece, 26-gauge at 1 yuan and 4 jiao, and 28-gauge at 1 yuan and 3 jiao, it is said. Market price.</p>

<p>— Kang Jian'erfu</p>
<p>"The Flying General descends from the sky," is an ancient saying. Modern air warfare truly lives up to this saying.</p>
<p>Children! Do you know the dangers of aerial warfare? Do you know that the world's great powers are actively preparing for a second world war? Do you know that the "God of War" will soon grace us with his presence?</p>
<p>The facts are clearly before our eyes. According to the latest figures on military aircraft, France has 3,000, Soviet Russia has 2,800 to 3,000, the United States has 2,468, Japan has 1,600, and Italy and England each have 1,500. All of these are in preparation for the aerial warfare of the future.</p>
<p>Compared to twenty years ago, on the eve of the World War, the annual military expenditures of various countries have increased several times over. For example, Italy has increased by 26%; Germany has increased by 48%; the United States has increased by 190% (i.e., one and nine-tenths times); and Japan has increased by 388% (i.e., nearly four times).</p>
<p>Are these tense and imminent situations not a harbinger of the God of War's arrival?</p>
<p>Children! We who are born in this era, facing imminent disaster, must prepare quickly! Unite quickly!</p>
<h3 id="e274">Ford's Childhood Dream <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Qiongyu</p>
<p>Mr. Ford, the American automobile tycoon, I presume you have all heard of him. Now, I am going to introduce to you his childhood dream that eventually came to fruition. I think you will all be delighted to hear it.</p>
<p>Ford started school at the age of six. Because he was very intelligent, he did very well in school. However, he always felt that merely studying books was uninteresting, and that it would be better to study something practical. Therefore, in his spare time, he would take apart clocks and study them carefully. After a year of such dedicated study, he had a clear understanding of the various components of a clock. In this way, he became a small clock repairman. After repairing clocks for a few years, he became a little tired of it and wanted to make his own clocks. At that time, he had already obtained his father's permission to work as an apprentice in a machine factory. At this time, in his spare time, he studied the machines for making clocks. As a result, he invented a new clock-making machine which, according to his calculations at the time, could produce hundreds of clocks per day. He was only seventeen years old at this time!</p>
<p>Dear children, I hope that you will also have the thoughts and aspirations of Mr. Ford. In this way, there will be a glimmer of hope for China's future.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Winter <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Azalea</p>
<p>The leaves are withered and fallen,</p>
<p>Having lost their autonomy,</p>
<p>Following a gust of wind,</p>
<p>They wail mournfully in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Oh, so winter has arrived!</p>
<p>The cold wind gradually becomes violent,</p>
<p>The temperature slowly drops,</p>
<p>Small insects cannot withstand the ravages of nature,</p>
<p>Some die, and those that remain hibernate.</p>
<p>Oh, so this is winter's revelation!</p>
<p>Winter has come,</p>
<p>The landscape is desolate;</p>
<p>Accompanied by heavy snowfall,</p>
<p>It chills everyone's heart.</p>
<p>But, harsh winter, harsh winter,</p>
<p>Under your oppression, our blood boils,</p>
<p>We are the children!</p>
<h3 id="e276">Aspire to Be an Aviator <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Yun</p>
<p>Human transportation, in addition to land and water, has expanded to the air. The convenience and swiftness of airplanes and airships are truly beyond what people expected. Therefore, the 20th century is truly an era in which mankind has conquered the skies. Not only will future transportation be in the air, but military warfare will also shift from water and land to the air, because aerial warfare offers a greater assurance of victory.</p>
<p>The countries of Europe and America have a great interest in the aviation industry, so the development of the aviation industry is truly astonishing. Children! I believe you all know that on October 12th of this year, twenty aircraft from six countries competed in a long-distance flight of over 10,000 miles from London, England, to Newsham, Australia. As a result, an aircraft called the Comet won the championship in just 71 hours and 18 minutes, demonstrating their enthusiasm for the aviation industry.</p>
<p>If China wants to resist foreign aggression, it must expand its air force. Not long ago, everyone enthusiastically donated money to buy airplanes, which is a very gratifying thing. But I want to go one step further and hope that children will aspire to be aviators, so that they can serve the country in future wars with foreign countries.</p>
<h3 id="e277">With Good Hands, One Must Write Well <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>American Judge Malone lost both of his hands early in his life. But since he became a judge, he needed to write to handle cases. Since he lost both hands, how could he write? For all records, he used his lips and teeth to hold a pen, and his writing was smooth and free. Within every sixty hours, he could handle more than four hundred cases. Isn't this exceptional! (See the copperplate illustration.)</p>
<p>Children, you are born with healthy hands, but often you do not know how to write well. Either the structure is uneven, or it is crooked and distorted. Of course, this is because you are young and still need to practice, but if you do not pay attention to practice regularly, you will never make progress in the future.</p>
<p>Since we are Chinese, of course we must know how to write Chinese characters; the more learned a person is, the better he can write.</p>
<p>Practice calligraphy is not much each day, as long as you are persistent, write a certain number of large characters and a certain number of small characters every day, or write large characters one day and small characters the next day. As the saying goes, "Calligraphy requires a hundred days of effort." As long as you continue every day without interruption, and persevere, there is no way you won't improve.</p>
<p>Malone lost both hands and had no choice but to use his lips and teeth to hold a pen to write. As for the method of holding the pen for writing, that is also very important. Briefly speaking, the thumb and index finger should be used to grip the pen tightly, the back of the hand should be round, and the palm of the hand should be empty, so that the writing has strength. I am telling you this in passing.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Stranger <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Wang</p>
<p>There was a magician who, while preparing for his performance, felt the need for a child to help him, so he called his son over and told him what to do.</p>
<p>"Thomas! Be careful, you must not let people know that you are my son. You must pretend you don't know me, understand?" he warned his son.</p>
<p>"Understood, Father!" Thomas replied gently.</p>
<p>When the performance started, the magician asked, "Who would like to come up and help me?"</p>
<p>Thomas quickly climbed onto the stage! The magician turned around and said to him, "Very good! Are you willing to help me?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" said Thomas.</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen me before?" the magician asked.</p>
<p>"No! Father! I have never seen you before!" Thomas replied quickly.</p>
<p>(Note) Thomas is the name of a young child.</p>

<h3 id="e280">Crab <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>|| Its Development Process and Living Conditions ||</p>
<p>(1) Female crab laying eggs. (2) Larva hatched from the egg (magnified). (3) Slightly larger, resembling a shrimp. (4) The young crab only resembles its parents after its first molt. (5) The young crab's last molt. (6) Crabs feed on plants, fish, insects, and shellfish. (7) Crabs often fight fiercely with each other. (8) The defeated crab, having lost a claw, is able to regenerate it.</p>
<p>Children, have you eaten crabs in the past two or three months? Have you studied the species of crabs? Crabs can be found in both the sea and the rivers. River crabs often dig holes on the bank to live in. The female's abdomen is round, and the male's is pointed. The female's body and claws are smaller than the male's. The female crab digs a hole in the mud and sand and lays eggs inside, arranging the eggs with its hind legs and then covering them with mud and sand. After a while, the larvae hatch from the eggs, and they are very, very small. Gradually, they grow and resemble the shape of a shrimp. Only after their first molt do they resemble their parents. With each molt, their bodies grow larger. The molting process is like this: the original hard shell splits open from the back, and the new, soft crab emerges. Soon, it grows into a hard shell. Crabs often fight, breaking off each other's claws, but they will grow new ones. When you go to the river to catch crabs, if you only grab one of its legs, it will immediately detach that leg and quickly escape. Originally, its claws and legs are both easily detached and able to regenerate. Isn't this very interesting?</p>

<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>Madam Shen, not knowing what to use them for, told a servant to measure out one liter of yellow beans and one liter of red beans; but the servant was careless and accidentally knocked over the measured yellow beans and red beans, mixing them together. Madam Shen was very angry and scolded the servant. Then she brought the yellow beans out and told Spring Brother, Summer Sister, Autumn Brother, and Winter Sister to separate them. Yellow beans go with yellow beans, and red beans go with red beans. So the four children worked together, the brothers picking out the yellow beans and the sisters picking out the red beans.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen, hearing his wife's scolding, hurriedly walked out of his study and asked what was happening. After his wife explained the reason, he ran around to the four children and saw that they were enthusiastically picking out the beans; two picking out the yellow ones and two picking out the red ones. Mr. Shen saw this and said, "You are too foolish. Why do you four have to pick out the yellow and red beans separately? If you four pick out the yellow beans at the same time, wouldn't the remaining beans be red beans? And you would save half the effort." The four children all agreed.</p>

<p>(1) Making Cold Hands Warm</p>
<p>Children! Winter is coming soon. In winter, your hands feel very cold. If you don't wear gloves when doing things, you can't withstand the cold. If you do wear gloves, your hands feel numb, which is very inconvenient. Therefore, in order to avoid these troubles, you can repeatedly rub your hands together before doing things. This will generate heat, and then you won't feel timid when working!</p>
<p>(2) Treating Chilblains</p>
<p>Children! Do you get chilblains in winter? This is a very painful thing. The simplest way to treat them is to soak cotton in kerosene and apply it as a bandage before going to bed. After a few days, you will surely be completely healed. If the skin has already rotted and the pain is unbearable, then grind rhubarb into a powder, mix it with water, and apply it. The pain will stop immediately.</p>

<p>(1) Poland is a newly emerging country in Europe. It was once a subjugated country. After the European war, they became independent and stopped being slaves to others, enjoying all freedoms. Therefore, their girls are also very happy, and practice dancing in their spare time. (2) Xinjiang is a province in western China. Their civilization cannot be compared to ours, so their dress is still the same as in ancient times. The children there have even fewer opportunities to study. They go to work as soon as the sun rises, and go to sleep as soon as the sun sets. Because education is not widespread, the government has gradually begun to pay attention to helping them.</p>
<p>(3) India has already been subjugated. Because they believe in Buddhism, they don't even care about their country. After the British invaded, some of them began to believe in Christianity. This girl is a Christian, and she is constantly asking God to prevent her from being a slave in a subjugated country, but this is also wishful thinking. (4) Java is a small island in the South Seas. It is a territory of the Netherlands. Their children live in a tropical area, so they are often naked and also like to dance.</p>

<p>Animals' Food Consumption When we go to the zoo and see many strangely shaped animals, the things that these animals eat, speaking of tigers, leopards, lions, and elephants, which we have not seen, are truly astonishing. For example, the food consumption of a lion: every day it is fed seven or eight pounds of beef and horse meat, five or six pounds of milk, and one live rabbit. Every day it costs at least three yuan to feed it. Elephants are originally big eaters. Every day they eat thirty or forty pounds of sweet potatoes, three or four pounds of radishes, more than twenty pounds of straw, and five or six pounds of weeds. Their food costs more than five yuan. Polar bears eat one and a half pounds of fish and meat, two and a half pounds of bread, and two pounds of milk every day. It costs about one and a half yuan per day. Tigers and leopards eat the same food as lions, but the amount is slightly less, but it still costs about two yuan. Camels and polar bears are the opposite, they eat everything, such as wheat, grass, and salt, which are their main foods. They eat about fifteen pounds every day, but the food is not expensive, and it only costs two or three jiao to feed them. The food consumption of other animals, although there is more or less, fine or coarse, cannot be completely distinguished.</p>
<p>Animals' Lifespans The animal with the longest lifespan is the whale, which can live for 500 years. Next is the tortoise, which can live for 300 years. Carp and elephants can live for 200 years. Eagles and crocodiles can live for 160 years. Crows, ducks, and geese can live for 100 years. Doves and bears live for 50 years. Domestic ducks live for 44 years. Toads, cranes, and cuckoos live for 40 years. Lions live for 35 years. Horses live for 30 years. Cattle live for 25 years. Canaries live for 24 years. Cats live for 22 years. Earthworms and chickens live for 20 years. Rabbits, snails, and slugs live for 9 years. Chipmunks and mice live for 6 years. Fleas live for 90 days. Cicadas live for 40 days. Flies live for 8 days. Butterflies, from pupa to emergence, can live for 10 days. Mayflies only live for 5 hours. As for the lifespan of us humans, on average, we should be able to live to 50 years old. However, because of differences in local civilization, hygiene, disasters, and environment, there are also long and short lifespans. Before 30 years ago, Chinese people could live to an average of 45 years old. Since 30 years ago, they can only live to an average of 32 years old. This comes from the "Comparison Table of Lifespans of People in Various Countries" by a famous anthropologist. But if we investigate carefully, it is now rare to find people who can live to be over 80 years old. Among plants, pine, camphor, cedar, ginkgo (duck foot tree), cypress, fir, torreya, etc., can all live for more than a thousand years.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Feast for Virtuous Widows <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>Following the trend of "restoration of the old ways," first there was the order prohibiting men and women from bathing together...and then there was the slogan of women returning to the home. It is expected that in this antique new China and new era, monuments to chastity may be brought out again by the old and young as a front for promoting old morality and promoting inherent civilization. Sure enough! On the 8th of this month, the "China Daily" had the following record...</p>
<p>Guangzhou News..."Daluo Village, Panyu, is where the Ma, Chen, and Huang surnames live together, each with thousands of descendants, most of whom go out"</p>
<p>"To make a living. Recently, the local gentry, in order to promote old morality and save the declining customs, decided to allocate 3,000 taels of gold from the surplus of the school funds to investigate the widows of the three surnames, regardless of age, who have been observing chastity for more than three years. A colorful shed was built in the Tianhou Temple, and the widows of the three surnames were invited to a joint banquet, called the 'Feast for Virtuous Widows,' which was held on the 10th day of the lunar month, the Xia Yuan Festival. It was found that there were 413 widows among the Chen, Ma, and Huang surnames. The oldest woman, Ma Chen, was eighty years old and had been a widow for fifty-one years, sitting in the first seat. The youngest woman was Chen Huang, who was only twenty-two years old. She had lost her husband at the age of seventeen and sat in the last seat. First, the deputy township head, Chen Zengling, respectfully invited the women to take their seats, and lectured on Confucian classics and the virtuous widows of the previous Qing dynasty who were erected and honored with archways. The women in the banquet listened attentively, very happily. Only in the evening did they take photos and disperse." After finally fighting for the written agreement of legal co-chastity, suddenly such good news came, which made people feel like crying and laughing!</p>
<p>Widowhood chastity, China's past laws || the early years of the Republic of China, there were regulations praising heroines and virtuous women || had been explicitly praised, but in current law, a widow's remarriage is now considered a legal act! Unexpectedly, Guangdong, the source of the revolution, would actually have such a retrogressive and counter-revolutionary good deed! This makes us sigh, "Where is the revolution?" In addition, we also know that in the current social system, the law is really just a written agreement, and the old forces entrenched in the current society are the source of manufacturing man-eating rites and teachings, which can ignore the law and ignore everything.</p>
<p>"Food and sex are human nature" This is the saying of the ancient sages, and the promoters of restoration will certainly not deny it. Women are people, and they also have human nature. May I ask those who cling to the past, how do they answer? At the feast for virtuous widows, there were eighty-year-old women who had been widows for fifty-one years, as well as twenty-two-year-old young women who had been observing chastity for more than five years. Under the shackles of the old rites and teachings, they were spending time against nature, living a sad and painful life. The so-called "moving to listen, extremely happy," is probably just the fantasy in the muddle-headed minds of those senile gentry, or just a forced smile under authority!</p>
<p>Old rites and teachings! Old rites and teachings, this invisible ferocious tiger, how many thousands of sisters have been swallowed and skinned alive in the past! Because the doors were opened, it had slightly disappeared, and now, with the wind of restoration, it is coming back. Women's movement groups, quickly come and put out this flood and ferocious beast!</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Current State of Chinese Working Women <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Guanlu</p>
<p>Everyone knows that China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country. Chinese working women — specifically, the vast number of women engaged in manual labor — are, of course, partly subject to the oppression of feudal landlords in rural areas. However, the greater part of them lives under the control of factory capital operated by the masters of the colony.</p>
<p>Chinese cities are dominated by capitalist powers, and Chinese villages also exist under the influence of capitalist countries, our colonial masters, not only indirectly but also directly. To understand the lives of Chinese working women today, we must first pay attention to the state of capitalism that directly impacts these women.</p>
<p>The highest stage of capitalist development is marked by its uneven development and contradictions. The characteristics of capitalism in this stage are:</p>
<p>(1) The concentration of capital and production. Banks are transferred from the hands of intermediaries to those of all-powerful monopolists, and the establishment of financial oligarchies greatly increases the speed of "the process of capital concentration and monopoly formation."</p>
<p>(2) The increasing unification of bank capital and industrial capital; banks become the main masters of production, and financial capital occupies a dominant position in the economy and politics.</p>
<p>(3) The export of capital occupies a particularly important position in economic policy. The entire capitalist country becomes a "parasitic" state and a "rentier state"; this country increases the number of rentiers whose sole task is to clip dividend coupons; they neither produce nor distribute, but are merely consumers who enjoy the fruits of labor without working.</p>
<p>(4) Based on the above elements, the nature of capitalism's division of the world is complete. At this time, capitalism has developed to its final stage, the so-called imperialist stage. The last clear indicator of this stage is the manifestation of international monopoly organizations, which is the desire to divide the world and create one's own colonies.</p>
<p>The highest stage of capitalist development is the imperialist stage, which is also a period of general crisis. This period is not an organization or maturation of capitalist contradictions, nor a refuge, but a time of turmoil, panic, and the need to find another way out.</p>
<p>Capitalism has now reached such a stage, with overproduction, financial panic, and aggression against colonies being its manifestations.</p>
<p>Naturally, seeking colonies is the way out for capitalist countries, and seeking larger colonies is their greater way out. China, with its vast land and large population, is the country that best meets their demands. In recent years, the bankruptcy of Chinese villages and the increasing colonization of the lives of ordinary people, the panic of capitalism has been expressed in our invasion in every detail.</p>
<p>However, under this invasion, the most exploited are manual laborers, and the lives of working women are even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss urban and rural working women separately.</p>
<p>Urban working women, apart from a small number who serve as domestic employees, are mostly factory workers — including the unemployed. In capitalist countries, the wages of female and child laborers are generally lower than those of male laborers. This proves that the system of capitalist countries is fundamentally sexist; it sees women as incapable, cheap, or unable to be responsible and independently engage in labor. Their abilities and the trust others have in them can only be compared with those of minors — child laborers. The capitalist system treats non-working women as commodities and working women as young children. In this respect, Chinese working women, who are subject to the current stage of capitalist aggression, are already in a position where they cannot survive.</p>
<p>Let's first look at urban working women. Leaving aside those engaged in personal labor, let's look at the lives of factory women in recent years:</p>
<p>There are many women workers in Shanghai's light industrial factories. Entrepreneurs use the "female workers' wages are lower than male workers'" tactic, and light industrial factories prefer to recruit female workers. The best-paid and relatively easier job in light industrial factories can be considered to be in silk weaving factories. Skilled workers in silk factories, those who weave the best silk, can earn more than forty yuan a month. However, it is not easy for many people to earn such a wage in a factory with hundreds of women workers; moreover, it is not easy for a woman worker to earn such a wage for several months of the year. This is because it is inevitable that any worker will take sick leave during the year; it is also inevitable that they will be punished and have their wages deducted because the machine or raw materials are faulty, thus ruining the silk. No one can completely and consistently earn their ideal wage every month.</p>
<p>The above situation refers to a small number of skilled workers; skilled workers require many conditions: long years of work, good silk weaving, and "youth and strength."</p>
<p>As for the general situation: new workers must pay a deposit of thirty yuan — those who cannot pay are exempt, which is a special and necessary procedure for silk factories — and then enter the factory as apprentices. The apprenticeship period is indefinite; with good opportunities, they can learn earlier; with bad opportunities, it can be extended to more than a year. There is no wage during the apprenticeship period. After learning, they must wait for the factory to assign their own machine. If the factory does not have a spare machine to assign to them at that time, they cannot get the regular wage — the wage for weaving on someone else's machine can only be calculated at a certain percentage.</p>
<p>The life in silk factories is the best life for women workers. Next are cotton mills and silk reeling factories. In cotton mills, there is generally no time for meals; the machines do not stop during meals, and the rice is eaten with cotton wool. The amount of wages is only forty to fifty cents a day.</p>
<p>The situation in silk reeling factories and other factories is similar. With this amount of wages, female workers not only have to support themselves, but also have to take it home to support their parents, children, and unemployed husbands.</p>
<p>Female workers have no rest period before and after childbirth, and all their salaries are deducted for taking leave. Women who live this kind of working life often lose their lifelong health during their young reproductive years!</p>
<p>The capitalist crisis's invasion of China drags formerly unliberated lower-class "slave" women under machines to serve as colonial cows.</p>
<p>The above is the life of urban working women. Now let's look at rural working women:</p>
<p>Also because of the capitalist crisis's attack on us, China's rural economy has fallen into a fragmented state. Of course, farmers who engage in four seasons of cultivation cannot survive by relying on their own production; in addition, landlords who are about to go bankrupt take advantage of them even more intensely to maintain their own comfort. Under these conditions, how do rural working women live?</p>
<p>If the husband sells all his labor and it is not enough to maintain the family's livelihood, the women have to do things that they are unwilling to do and cannot do. Disregarding their physical strength, they work in the fields and mountains; they do not rest during illness, childbirth, and raising children; as women who combine the responsibilities of domestic servants, mothers, wives, and chicken, duck, dog, and pig keepers, and throw themselves into field work, they cannot care about aging, illness, and sacrifice to serve all their masters and maintain their own lives; however, in reality, they sacrifice their future lives to maintain their current lives. Such working women have no leisure and no possibility to take care of their lifelong affairs, their own happiness, their present and future health and well-being. In this semi-feudal country of China, women have never broken the old shackles, especially working-class women, who rely on despised labor and trivial household services; relying on being passive sexual machines, they buy out their unfree lives; however, this kind of life is not the most bitter. The gifts that capitalist intensification has given them in recent years; maintaining their old lives and adding new labor to them, makes working women more prone to disease and death. Chinese working women, if they want to gain liberation and live human lives, the anti-feudal and especially the anti-foreign invasion efforts are absolutely not something that can be relied on others, but their own task!</p>
<h3 id="e287">My Marriage Problem <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Hua</p>
<p>The issue of marriage is truly a struggle in my life. With the progress of the times and the gaining of self-awareness, this struggle is almost an epitome of a social mechanism.</p>
<p>When I was still in my mother's womb, I was already predetermined to be someone's property as a gift from my father to tie up friendly relations. The environment gave me confinement and imprisonment, and the demands of sexual love burned like a raging fire; I was like a captive, carried off and subdued in a feudal iron cage. That stranger, the so-called husband, had to satisfy my every arbitrary demand for enjoyment; in his eyes, I was respected like a god; he knew clearly that all social customs and laws, like iron nets through which electric currents passed, were densely layered around our family, and I, the god he kept, had no way to escape. Nothing is more hypocritical and shameful than this system of monogamy, which originates from private property and proclaims the absolute domination of men over women — on the one hand, he used a kind and joyful face to cover up the ferocious inner heart of a beast, confining me to be tamed to relieve his sorrows and unconditionally serve him; on the other hand, he sought his emotional satisfaction without any scruples. — How ridiculous and trivial this is! Finally, I jumped out of this vicious trap.</p>
<p>Free love, originating from the individualistic demand for sexual love, was the path for me, a prisoner liberated from a feudal family. However, this life gave me great displeasure. Although I cannot deny the great significance of representing an independent personality in gender relations, in this embrace of love, my life stagnated and suffocated, as if I were a corpse whose coffin had been closed and a final verdict had been reached; everything had lost its luster to me, and my heart was as dead as ashes. The meaning of my economic independence was to obtain a profession that would make the new (small) family more vibrant. My lover, like me, devoted his whole heart and body to love and was loyal to love. Is love sacred? This is a deceptive statement! "Love," like life itself, demands to be developed, demands new adaptations; it is the creative self. Inevitably, this relationship (hypocritical free love) gave us boredom, depression, and undeniably, mutual harm to our lives. How terrible it is when we routinely have to kiss or have sex, a physiological necessity, a habitual necessity, forcing our love to complete itself, and behind the joy, love shivers with the coldness of having its marrow devalued. I asked myself: "Is love the entire meaning of your life?" In the midst of this, the spur of life, the demands of life, and especially the era-specific critique, I became rational.</p>
<p>I fully understand my life and the sexual love in gender relations, in all the social relationships that do not belong to myself, and what attitude I should take to solve my marriage problem.</p>
<p>Men almost without exception are confined by the atmosphere of feudal remnants. If he is only loved by me for his heroic spirit and magnificent demeanor, then undoubtedly, I will only get the satisfaction of pure sexual desire, and disillusionment will follow our joy. This life of sacred love, stagnating in the individual circle, has given us many lessons, and should marriage not be treated as a child's play, whether in society or in one's own spirit and time? Then shall we let it be trapped in that disillusioned love? If the one I love is a stumbling block on my path forward, then shall we stop and no longer move forward? Kick away this stumbling block? Then how can our long journey bear the burden of this private drag? Singleness? Why kill my physiological nature? Therefore, his understanding of society, his compelling vision of society, his life in society, and mutual understanding and harmony are necessary conditions.</p>
<p>In this union, what people who simply treat love as child's play cannot imagine is how a brand new spirit is displayed in the mutual understanding and criticism, the dialectical development of new forces, and the promotion of the high development of human life. This force makes our tense lives, in both of our hearts, fear that our own lack of effort or laziness will be abandoned by the times and be unfortunate. Because both sides' love is built on the mutual effort of learning and career; this effort is not only the driving force of the mutual attraction of love, but love is precisely the power that accompanies each other's spiritual upward movement to gain new life; therefore, the other party's abandonment is a sign of the depravity of my life, which is the important reason for this unfortunate result; this contains social significance, who dares to risk this taboo and willingly live in the contempt of falling down? Therefore, in our sexual relationship, there is no rigid perfunctoriness or playing with it; whether it is after a long separation or a long period of cohabitation, every embrace, trembling from the source of life, intoxicates us with the love of the first moment. Here, the constant new forces are the chains that bind us tightly together; if love suddenly springs from the heart for someone, we must frankly say to each other the correct criticism: "You are wrong!" Or say: "Indeed, her (or his) points of attraction are worth your love!" We clearly recognize that any means of restraining the other party is a fatal destruction to the spirit and love, that is, one's own destruction. Jealousy originating from possession has gradually been forgotten in our relationship! The positive view and review of life quenched some burning flames in my or his heart, and we became more closely linked.</p>
<p>It is undoubtedly the case that gender relations are created forward with career as the center, so if there are any reasons that cause cracks between us, it is either that I have factors that destroy "love" or that he is degenerate. If this driving force for our spiritual upward movement cannot function, is there still a need to maintain this corrupt relationship? Basically, one is upward and one is declining, it goes without saying that this declining one gives the upward one a terrible obstacle; what will "love" rely on to not die? What is the basis of this relationship? Naturally, there is only separation.</p>
<p>Struggle is life! Gender relations must be developed forward with struggle!</p>
<h3 id="e288">Old Mou <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>The winter in the north country is like a knife.</p>
<p>There is no wind, but the cold still urges people to shrink their necks and huddle together like hedgehogs, and everyone has a premonition in their hearts: it will snow soon.</p>
<p>In the evening, after unloading a heavy burden, he shook the dust off his body and wound his way back to his residence along a winding path. The slowly drifting snowflakes hastened people's steps, and the tips of their noses ached.</p>
<p>When I walked past the low wall by the roadside, I was stunned. So many people were surrounding the door, with those in the back squeezing those in the front. Mixed in were the children's shouts, and I smelled the scent of paper money. I understood that someone had just stopped breathing inside.</p>
<p>"Old Mou is really cruel, abandoning three children and only caring about following the children's father to die..."</p>
<p>"It's also for the money! When the head of the family (Note: People in Beiping call their husband 'head of the family.') was alive, he could still supplement the family a little, but now he has to incur a debt!" I recognized that this was the seamstress Lin Dejia's family. She frowned tightly and continued: "Old Mou doesn't know how long she's been hanging. Alas, there's still a pile of laundry she took on waiting to be washed in the basin."</p>
<p>Hearing that it was a laundry woman, I suddenly understood. There wouldn't be many laundry women in this alley. It must be the one who often came to the owner of my house to pick up bedsheets. Sometimes she would ask me, and I would stretch out my strong arms and joke with the woman, saying that I was stronger than her. It was true, this woman's leanness wouldn't make people believe that she could bend over the green pottery basin for five or six hours every day. Only the corners of her eyes showed that she was only in her thirties.</p>
<p>I patted Lin Dejia's shoulder:</p>
<p>"Hey, what's going on, so crowded!"</p>
<p>The woman put down her tiptoed toes, surprised:</p>
<p>"You — you this girl is really scary! Come, come, see Old Mou, punish you, Old Mou's head of the family is still stiff on the kang!"</p>
<p>This time, Lin Dejia used all her strength, and we successfully blocked the doorway. I didn't know if it was really impossible to squeeze in, or if Lin Dejia herself was timid.</p>
<p>People's gaze seemed to shift from the dead man on the kang to the living man sitting on the long bench wiping tears, who almost died too. Ignoring the deep, purplish-red marks on his neck, which was revealed by the open collar, that was the reason why a tall man was swelling with veins on his forehead and scolding. He lived in a taller tiled house in the same alley. Old Mou's rented house was his. At this time, the cursing continued:</p>
<p>"Never heard of it, when the head of the family dies, instead of quickly arranging the funeral, she stubbornly hangs herself. Are we still planning to rent out this house tomorrow!" He wiped his sweat on a snowy day, "The women should also have an idea!"</p>
<p>Three children, all no taller than a table, stared blankly at their dead father on the kang and their sobbing mother. The woman held the smallest one in her arms, and two small eyes stared at the deep, purplish-red marks in her neck, as if with pity and awe.</p>
<p>The woman burst into tears again, pointing to one on the kang:</p>
<p>"I don't even have money to buy a straw mat. His pair of sugar-peddling poles can't even sell for a few dollars. That's how he'll go underground!..."</p>
<p>"You might as well die too, then it'll be over? Thinking about other people's coffins!" The man breathed out, "Think of a way to borrow some money to bury him, and don't rent my house as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Everyone persuaded him, and the man went out angrily. The woman stopped crying and discussed with her companions borrowing ten or so dollars to bury the dead. She would slowly repay the debt by doing more work herself.</p>
<p>People gradually dispersed and came out. Snowflakes had accumulated on the ground and didn't melt, and gloom ruled the world. Stepping out of the door, I could still faintly hear a weak sigh.</p>
<p>"There is no freedom even in death!"</p>
<p>The days flew by. It had been more than ten days since that snowy day. Late at night, when I walked past a group of resting rickshaw pullers, I saw the woman who wanted to die but couldn't. She was busy pouring hot tea for the rickshaw pullers. A carrying pole lay horizontally on the ground, with a basket of rough bowls on one end and a teapot a little smaller than a wine jar on the other.</p>
<p>"Old Mou! My voice leaped with joy."</p>
<p>A thin face lifted up and recognized me after a long time:</p>
<p>"Ah, it turns out it's you!" Then she stopped talking.</p>
<p>I waited for her business to end, and she picked up the load. She counted the gains in the basket, which were nine large coins. In the small alley, two people, strangers yet familiar, walked along. She said that the money was borrowed in advance from the washing clients and would be deducted slowly. Sooner or later, the money from selling hot tea would feed the three children. Her voice was so slow, and the tone suffocated me. A heavy life, having reaped away the laughter, was slowly crawling in the darkness.</p>
<p>When she arrived at her door, she put down the load and slowly used a rusty key to open the rusty lock.</p>
<p>The house was pitch black. The woman shuffled in, carrying the load. In the dimness, I seemed to see the three sleeping faces on the earthen kang. Perhaps when their mother lay down beside them, they wouldn't even stir, because their dreams were so deep and so far away.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Jianchuan Woman <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>"Better to hire a Jianchuan woman,</p>
<p>Than buy a mule to haul."</p>
<p>This is a saying sung by people near Jianchuan. It is rare indeed that a woman is considered inferior to a mule.</p>
<p>Jianchuan County is in Yunnan, about a hundred miles from Dali. It is also a remote place, and the women there are very different from those in other places. If women in Shanghai eat two bowls of rice per meal, then they must have at least ten bowls. Their feet are said to be like a small steamer, that big. Though this is an exaggeration, it is evident that their natural feet are much bigger than bound feet!</p>
<p>There is no need to detail the height and strength of their bodies with measurements. Ordinarily, it takes at least two people to carry a coffin, but a Jianchuan woman can carry a coffin with one hand. How amazing is that! The many strongmen and heroes in Chinese history must have indeed had such tall statures.</p>
<p>Let's take an example of their daily hard work and being treated like cattle and horses. There is still nine parts of feudal meaning here, and women most like to be the wife of a scholar. Now scholars have been abolished, and going to foreign schools in other big cities is just as glorious. When women marry a scholar, their husbands will certainly not hire or buy a mule to drag themselves and their luggage over high mountains and ridges to go to school; instead, the women will lift their husbands and place them on their shoulders, and the luggage will be hung on their bodies. Whatever a mule can drag, a Jianchuan woman always has the strength to carry. This unbelievable thing exists in this way. It is by no means difficult to carry so much weight on one's body, crossing high mountains and ridges for more than ten days. It is truly like livestock being used as cattle and horses by men. It is not enough to be good and normal cattle and horses! They have two sayings to laugh at women's inferiority:</p>
<p>"Better to hire a mule to haul,</p>
<p>Than marry a Jianchuan woman!"</p>
<p>It is clear that a Jianchuan woman is inferior to a mule.</p>
<p>It is not that Jianchuan women are born slaves, but rather that it is created by the special economic and geographical environment of Jianchuan. And because it is an era in which the remnants of the old society are still spreading, women are regarded as cattle and horses, as slaves, and used like machines, which is still common everywhere, especially in our old and civilized China. This kind of customs and habits often make people feel nauseous.</p>
<p>The strong and tall bodies and the hard-working labor of Jianchuan women are not shame and meanness. On the contrary, it is precisely the correct path for women, and healthy beauty and the ability to labor are what modern women need most. We should not laugh at Jianchuan women's feet that look like a small steamer, but we should pay attention to canceling:</p>
<p>"Better to hire a mule to haul,</p>
<p>Than marry a Jianchuan woman."</p>

<h3 id="e291">Christmas and New Year <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>▲ Using the Telephone ▲ Wishing You Prosperity in the New Year</p>
<p>The year is drawing to a close, and in the blink of an eye, Christmas is approaching, and the New Year is about to begin. During this time, social interactions among people are even more cordial than usual: exchanging gifts is one aspect, and sending greeting cards is another; but for those separated by distance, the longing at the year's end is particularly strong. Every festive occasion makes them feel even more sentimental. What can console them? The answer is telegrams.</p>
<p>Telegrams, used to exchange messages and convey feelings between people around Christmas, can be said to be extremely appropriate. I recall that in the past, telegram fees did not differentiate between New Year's greetings and ordinary telegrams. Later, as major commercial ports grew, and more Westerners resided in China, sending telegrams overseas to express sincere New Year's greetings became a quick way to convey their sentiments. Therefore, Christmas and New Year's greeting telegrams became indispensable for those who paid attention to social etiquette.</p>
<p>In fact, New Year's greeting telegrams are just one type of social telegram. Chinese people are enthusiastic about socializing, talking extensively about it. The Ministry of Communications has taken advantage of this and has already made regulations for cheaper social telegrams. Greeting Christmas and the New Year are most important in social interactions, and the prices have also been reduced accordingly. Modern men and women must pay attention to this.</p>
<p>The peak period for New Year's greeting telegrams was after 1921, especially in major commercial ports, where the numbers were highest. At the end of the year, telegraph office staff were exceptionally busy. During the New Year holidays, all sectors indulged in revelry, and the increase in telegram traffic was the highest of the year. The trend of the times led to the establishment of social telegrams, which, regardless, represent a good sign of celebrating peace and unity.</p>
<h3 id="e292">"Peace," "Cooperation," "Unity" and Telecommunications <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>As the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is about to open, the Central Government, for the sake of sincere unity, specially sent Sun Ke and Wang Chonghui to the South to discuss national affairs with the Southwest delegates. The result was exceptionally satisfactory, and they decided on the three principles of "peace," "cooperation," and "unity." This means that the opinions between the Central Government and Guangdong and Hong Kong over the past few years have been completely resolved. From now on, they will work together harmoniously and cooperatively. The great foundation of the Party and the country is established from this point. "A word can revive a nation," which is what the trip of Sun and Wang achieved.</p>
<p>The people of the country hope for "peace," "cooperation," and "unity" is extremely widespread. The need for "peace," "cooperation," and "unity" in the transportation industry is particularly urgent. Taking telecommunications as an example, without the above three principles, there can be no talk of reorganization and expansion. Telecommunications is the nervous system of a country. If one place is not peaceful or one province does not cooperate, it will affect the entire plan, and even destroy the original construction. Looking at the times when wars occur, the telecommunications industry is the first to bear the brunt, such as the congestion of military telegrams, the suppression of commercial telegrams, the arbitrary appointment of bureau directors, the exhaustion of telegram funds, the seizure of telegraph lines, the cutting of telegraph poles, and the borrowing of telegraph staff. All kinds of demands and oppressive situations were too numerous to mention during the warlord era. Under the rule of the National Government, this trend has been somewhat suppressed, but due to the extremely close relationship between telecommunications and military affairs, it is inevitable that it will be subject to military control whenever wars occur. This is in terms of telecommunications itself. As for when armies meet, merchants are cut off, markets become ruins, and rural areas go bankrupt, what telecommunications business can be said to exist during this period? Therefore, the indirect losses of war to telecommunications cannot be measured by distance. Since the national crisis, the authorities have adhered to the doctrine of peace and unity, and in domestic policy, they have tolerated each other for the sake of the country. Except for suppressing bandits, they never resort to armed conflict. Therefore, the telecommunications industry has made daily progress in recent years, which is due to the gift of peace. This is also clear.</p>
<p>As for cooperation, it is even more necessary for telecommunications. Because China is vast in territory, densely populated, economically poor, and lacking talent, it is impossible for the central government to build wired, wireless, and telephone networks covering the entire country all at once. The protection of circuits, the assistance of manpower, and the transportation of materials cannot be achieved without the help of local governments and the public. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has stipulated supervisory regulations for privately-run local telephone services, allowing them to be established and supervised according to law. The Ministry of Communications has also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to formulate the "Principles for the Ministry of Communications to Entrust Provincial Governments to Operate Long-Distance Telephone Services," allowing them to go their separate ways but achieve the same goal. This embodies the intention of division of labor and cooperation within the overall system. The former is a matter of law and reason, while the latter is a matter of fact. One is to avoid conflicting with the rights and interests stipulated by the central government, and the other is to seek individual development for each province. Therefore, in June of this year, the Ministry of Communications entrusted the Zhejiang Provincial Government to operate long-distance telephone services, and in July, it carried out the connection between the ministry-run long-distance telephone services and the commercially-run local telephone services. These are all expressions of sincere cooperation.</p>
<p>Since they can live in peace and cooperate sincerely, the telecommunications administration itself is gradually entering the right track, and turning to promote political unity is a matter of course. In recent years, the telecommunications administrations of Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces have had many differences with the central government due to political relations. Since the telecommunications conference was held, the representatives from Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces have understood the central government's telecommunications policy and its intention to cooperate sincerely. Returning and conveying this to the authorities in Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces, the opinions on telecommunications administration are becoming more harmonious. International telegram fees can be paid on time, and unified voice has been established in foreign communications. Now, due to the political unification, the telecommunications unification problem will be solved easily.</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Communications held the telecommunications conference, the author once cited the unified spirit and cooperative spirit of the conference to the people of the country. The telecommunications business is an international communication tool, and there must be no disunity or lack of cooperation. Otherwise, it will be ridiculed as "unorganized" and "non-modern country." But unfortunately, if this phenomenon occurs occasionally, it is not the fault of the telecommunications administration itself, but the reflection of the domestic political environment. Now, the Fifth Plenary Session is held in the capital, deciding on major doubts and establishing major plans. Domestic policy must return to unity. Peace can be built, and cooperation can succeed. All businesses are based on this. Is it just telecommunications?</p>
<h3 id="e293">The Reorganization and Development of the Telecommunications Industry <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a sharp tool for people to communicate. Because scientific progress is advancing by leaps and bounds, since the invention of wired telegraph and telephone, in less than a few decades, there have been inventions of wireless telegraph and telephone. Now people use electric current to transmit messages. The tools that they use are wired telegraphs and telephones, and wireless telegraphs and telephones. The machinery is becoming more sophisticated, and the equipment is becoming more perfect. The progress of the telecommunications industry in Europe and the United States is really just beginning. Now I will talk about the reorganization and development of my country's telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>㈠ Wired Telegraph Because my country's wired telegraph has been through a lot of troubled times, the lines have often been accidentally destroyed, and the telecommunications economy is very difficult. Therefore, it is very difficult to build for a while, but the wired telegraph has already has a considerable scale. How can we allow it to be destroyed without trying to reorganize it? If you say that because there is wireless electricity, wired electricity should be eliminated by natural selection, and it can be completely abandoned, that is unreasonable. If more than a thousand telegraph offices were completely closed, more than a thousand wireless stations would have to be established to replace them. Not only does that not conform to economic principles, I am afraid that it is not allowed by facts either! It can be seen that wired telegraphs still need to be reorganized. Recently, I heard that the telecommunications authorities are doing their best to reorganize wired electricity. In terms of equipment, such as repairing lines and purchasing the latest machines, to ensure accuracy and speed. In terms of business, such as making fees low, and increasing the number of telegraph offices and postal and telecommunications agencies in major cities and towns and railway stations, all facilities are for the sake of promoting business and facilitating the people. It is considered a satisfactory thing!</p>
<p>㈡ Wireless Telegraph My country has a vast territory, and transportation in remote provinces is inconvenient. It is indeed quite difficult to build wired telegraphs. Because wireless electricity does not require the erection of lines, it does not have any difficulty setting up wireless stations in remote provinces and regions, even if there are high mountains and ridges. Wireless electricity has a considerable effect on remote communication. In the future, we should try our best to add remote radio stations. Not only will the people in remote areas get the convenience of communication, but it will also have a great effect on national defense. Secondly, my country's international telecommunications traffic has always relied on foreign merchants' water line companies to handle it, and it is inevitably restricted everywhere. Since the establishment of the International Radio Station, international communications have of course received considerable results, saving more than three million yuan in lost profits every year. It can be seen that wireless telegraphs have to be developed as much as possible in remote provinces and regions, and internationally.</p>
<p>㈢ Wired Telephone Wired telephone has the distinction of long-distance telephone and city telephone. Long-distance telephone is divided into two types: ministry-run and province-run, and city telephone also has two types: ministry-run and commercial-run. Recently, the development of long-distance telephone operated by provinces has been quite rapid, which inevitably affects the telegraph business. However, both telegraph and telephone are sharp tools for communication. Of course, it cannot be said that there is no need for long-distance telephone if there is a telegraph. However, for the sake of facilitating the people and conforming to economic principles, it seems that the long-distance telephone operated by the provinces does not need to set up lines in parallel with the long-distance telephone lines operated by the ministry, so as to avoid mutual competition and both sides being hurt. I remember that President Wang once said in his inaugural speech at the Ministry of Communications Telecommunications Conference that state-owned enterprises should work together. Then, the provincial long-distance telephone should first develop as much as possible in places where there is no long-distance telephone operated by the ministry, connecting calls, and connecting and transferring reports and calls with the long-distance telephone operated by the ministry and the telegraph bureau, so that the people can get real communication convenience.</p>
<p>Regarding city telephones, such as the recovery of the Shanghai Concession telephone issue and the improvement of machinery in various bureaus, they are all urgent plans to be drawn up. As for the telephone business, special attention must be paid to reforming bad habits and cracking down on arrears. In addition, the switchboard operators should be polite and courteous to users, and the connection should be as quick as possible, so that users are satisfied and the business can be developed.</p>
<p>㈣ Broadcasting Radio Station In recent years, the people of Shanghai and other major cities have been very interested in installing wireless radio receivers. Therefore, the private broadcasting stations in Shanghai have also adapted to the needs and have been increasing day by day. Among them, there are inevitably a small number of broadcasting stations that covet petty profits and secretly contact foreign firms, using wireless electricity to report commercial market conditions, which have been discovered and cracked down on by the inspection radio station of the International Telecommunications Bureau. Therefore, the development of wireless telephone, although it is a good phenomenon, it must also have considerable sanctions. If broadcasting stations can be allowed to report commercial market conditions concurrently, that will interfere with the business of the state-run telegraph bureau. I hope that the supervisors of telegraph bureaus in various places pay attention to this point, which may have something to do with the development of business.</p>
<p>Finally, my country's telegraph bureaus have always paid too little attention to publicity. It is rare to see business advertisements published by telegraph bureaus in various newspapers and magazines, so that the general public's impression of telegrams is very weak, which is also a reason why the telegraph business cannot develop. "Telegraph commercialization" is the proposition of the telecommunications authorities over the years. Advertising is a sharp tool for commercial publicity. This business advertising item must be paid more attention to, and it will always have considerable returns. I hope that the telecommunications authorities will promote telecommunications, especially international telecommunications, to a greater extent, so that everyone understands that international radio stations are sharp tools for promoting domestic products and saving profits. Then the future development of telecommunications will be unlimited!</p>

<p>— Ji Ran</p>
<p>In the essay in issue 22 of this publication, I stated that shared-battery telephone systems have their advantages, so even with the rise of automatic systems, shared-battery systems have not been eliminated. The advantage of the so-called shared-battery system is that if the management is good and the connection is fast, it is no different from an automatic telephone. However, the shared-battery system requires switchboard operators, and the services that these switchboard operators can provide to the public are often very useful. Mechanical automation can only bring more benefits to drivers. This is also one of the reasons why the shared-battery system is praised.</p>
<p>In 1927, an incident at the Shanghai Nanshi Telephone Bureau was often talked about. It was in the autumn, but I forgot the exact night. A child in a family in Nanshi was suffering from a serious illness, and they called various doctors in the city by telephone, but no one responded after midnight. At this time, the Shanghai bureau's telephone was a shared-battery system. Since there was no way to call a doctor, they told the switchboard operator and asked if there was any way to get a doctor from the concession to come. When asked which doctor they wanted, they said that they could choose either so-and-so or so-and-so. The switchboard operator, because it was midnight and the switchboard was not busy, successively called on their behalf. As a result, a doctor actually came to the door, and the child's illness was saved. Several days later, the child's parents went to the telephone bureau in person to ask who was on duty at the time, thanked them in person, and then placed an advertisement in the newspaper to thank them.</p>
<p>With automatic telephones, there is no switchboard operator to make the connection. The occurrence of this kind of accidental event is due to the operator. An operator is not necessary, but sometimes an operator can help the user, making the user fully satisfied. The following sections, translated from Western magazines, are also credible and have evidence!</p>
<p>When a fire occurs, users are often flustered and confused, and they often make mistakes when dialing the number, so that the fire department, police station, or insurance company they are calling cannot be reached for a while. If you use a shared-battery telephone, you only need to pick up the receiver and say the word "fire," and the operator will quickly transfer the call. In fact, it is much easier than using an automatic telephone. This is what some American users have experienced, and it is also why they recommend shared-battery telephones.</p>
<p>Theft also inevitably occurs in major American cities. For prevention, the important telephones of major companies are all installed underground, and a secret telephone is often installed separately in case of accidents. This kind of secret telephone is also suitable for shared-battery systems, because in the event of a robbery, you only need to have the telephone in hand and say the word "thief" lightly to the operator, without having to turn the dial and reveal your voice.</p>
<p>The rest are for social welfare matters. For private emergencies, being served by an operator on the telephone has more benefits than calling directly with an automatic telephone, and it cannot be denied across the board. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e295">Attention to Those Installing Broadcasting Radio Receivers <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Di You</p>
<p>Jin Huanyan Did Not Apply to Register a Privately Installed Radio Receiver</p>
<p>Tianjin Radio Station Detained and Sent to Court, Sentenced to a Fine</p>
<p>Jin Huanyan (also known as Jin Huanran and Jin Zhao Zhi) used to work in the wireless industry and has some electrical knowledge. Recently, he opened the Tianjin Xinyi Bank with others and engaged in the gold business. On November 29 of last year, he purchased two wireless radio receivers one after another and privately installed them at home (No. 29, Gongyi Lane, British Concession, Tianjin) to listen to the gold price market conditions issued by private radio stations for the use of the bank. The matter was detected by the Tianjin Radio Station on the 2nd of this month, and it reported to the Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital of Hebei Province, which went to search with the British Engineering Bureau. The case was solved on the spot, and the witnesses were transferred to the Tianjin District Court for trial. After being prosecuted by the procuratorate of the court according to law and after repeated trials, Jin Huanyan was finally sentenced to a fine of 1,200 yuan because he had not applied to register a privately installed radio receiver, which violated the provisions of Article 3 of the Telecommunications Regulations, in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the regulations.</p>
<p>The Provisional Measures for the Registration of Broadcasting Radio Receivers have long been promulgated by the Ministry of Communications. All those who install radio receivers should apply to the radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications in various places in accordance with the regulations and obtain a registration certificate before they are legal. Article 9 of the registration measures also stipulates: "If a household receives any radio signals other than broadcasting radio from its radio receiver, it shall keep it confidential." Now that Jin Huanyan has neither applied for registration nor listened to the gold price market conditions issued by the illegal private radio stations for profit, he has clearly violated the provisions of Article 3 of the Telecommunications Regulations and Article 9 of the Provisional Measures for the Registration of Radio Receivers. Now he has been sentenced to a fine of 1,200 yuan, which is entirely his own fault and deserves it. However, the circumstances of this case are different from the previous case of Yongli Bank and other private radio stations: Jin Huanyan only installed two radio receivers and did not have a transmitter, so he could not disturb the radio signals sent by others, and he himself could not send reports. Therefore, the damage to the national telecommunications business is small. Weighing the pros and cons, it cannot be compared with the Yongli Bank case and convicted of theft.</p>
<p>I have a feeling about this: All countries have regulations for the management of broadcasting radio receivers, and registration fees must be collected. People who install radio receivers all abide by laws and regulations and register in accordance with the registration procedures, which fully demonstrates that they are orderly and organized countries. However, my country is not like that. People often disregard national laws and regulations. Taking the registration of radio receivers as an example, it is enough to prove the superficiality of our legal concepts. According to surveys, there are about hundreds of thousands of households in the country that have installed radio receivers, but those who comply with the order to apply for registration are very few. Most of these hundreds of thousands of radio receiver installers are knowledgeable people with better living conditions, but they despise laws and regulations so much, which is really a manifestation of our people's lack of civic training. It is enough to expose the inferior roots of our nation and provide outsiders with ridicule. I heard that the communications authorities will set a deadline to order all telecommunications agencies under their jurisdiction to strictly crack down on unregistered radio receivers. I sincerely hope that all installers will quickly register automatically and not delay any longer, so as not to be punished by law and bring trouble to themselves!</p>
<p>The registration of radio receivers does not require any fees, and the procedures are very simple. The registration procedures are excerpted below for the reference of all radio receiver installers:</p>
<p>㈠ Each installer may obtain a registration application form from any of the following telecommunications agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, and shall fill in all the items in the application in detail: Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Ningbo, Wuhu Telegraph Bureau, Fuzhou, Dinghai, Xiamen, Chongming, Qidong, Shantou, Yichang, Nanchang, Changsha, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Ba County, Chengdu, Wanxian, Chang'an (Xi'an), Ningbo, Guiyang, Lanzhou,</p>
<p>㈡ The registrant shall fill in the following items in the registration application form: (A) Type of machine parts; (B) Antenna style; (C) Current supply status; (D) Wavelength range; (E) Machine value.</p>
<p>㈢ If there are any inaccuracies in the registration application form filled in by each installer, once discovered, it shall be treated as unregistered, and a corresponding fine shall be imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations.</p>

<p>Germany's Opening of Daytime Picture Telegraphs</p>
<p>According to German newspaper reports: Daytime picture transmission has now been extended to the public to transmit photos, such as wedding photos and birthday photos. Group photos or landscape photos taken with a fast lens can also be entrusted to telecommunication. This is regarded as a beautiful telegram. German postal and telecommunications bureaus all receive these daytime picture telegrams. The price of a daytime picture of 100 square centimeters is only four marks (approximately US$1.50) domestically.</p>
<p>The Popularity of Interpersonal Telegrams in Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Since May 1, Czech telegraph bureaus have begun to receive a type of inexpensive telegram with beautiful envelopes that can be used for birthday and anniversary celebrations. A total of 8,000 of these telegrams were received in May, showing their widespread use.</p>
<p>The Expansion of Long-Distance Telephone in the Philippines</p>
<p>The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company plans to connect Manila with Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Shanghai this year. This plan is part of its operation of global overseas wireless telephone services. The construction of the Manila-Hong Kong circuit may be completed before the Manila-Tokyo circuit, because the Hong Kong authorities have already promised to connect their local organizations and are now engaged in the necessary facilities. The Rapid Progress of Telecommunications in Soviet Russia</p>
<p>The first automatic telephone trunk line between Moscow and Bershin (approximately 625 miles) has recently been opened for business. The third automatic telephone exchange, which can accommodate 4,000 households, has also recently been opened in Moscow. The direct telegraph line between Moscow and Vladivostok has been completed. This line, which is approximately 6,000 miles long, will completely avoid the delays of previous intermediate bureau transmissions. In addition, a direct telephone line between London and Leningrad has also been established.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Parisian Travelogue <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Mao Tong</p>
<p>On October 9, at 11:15 pm, we left Geneva. We were in a third-class carriage, which was originally supposed to hold eight people per compartment, but there were only four of us in the same compartment, so we could barely sleep at night. The seats were all leather cushions, which were no less comfortable than the second-class carriages in my country. We arrived in Paris at 8:15 am on the 10th.</p>
<p>We stayed in Paris for a relatively long time. We visited the French Wireless Radio Factory (SFR for short), the commercially-run Radio France station, and the engineering laboratory of the Standard Electric Company.</p>
<p>The scale of the wireless radio factory is not large, about the same as the electrical manufacturing factory of the Construction Committee. It is divided into metal hardware and transceiver manufacturing departments. When we went to visit, we saw that most of the machines made inside were used on airplanes, warships, and merchant ships. They also make broadcast radios, the largest of which has a power of I2okw. There are also mobile radio stations for the air force. The transceivers are installed on two cars and can be driven to any location to communicate with the aircraft, which is also a powerful tool for modern military transportation.</p>
<p>Commercial wireless radio is partly state-run and is located in the post office. The locations it communicates with are limited to French colonies and some European countries, such as Russia and Persia. The rest are handled by the commercially-run wireless radio station. It is said that the station was established very early, and the French government granted it patent rights at that time. Its transmitting and receiving stations are all located outside the city, while the central receiving and transmitting room is located in the city. There are seven iokw shortwave transmitters, only one of which is a crystal type, and the rest are active oscillation high-power amplification type (M.O.P.A.). There are also eight high-frequency AC longwave machines with power ranging from 500kw to 25kw. The shortwave machines are used to communicate with the United States, China, Japan, and South America, while the longwave machines are used to work with European countries. The equipment at the receiving station is mostly old, but there is one relatively new one that was purchased from Marconi Company. The telegrams at the central receiving and transmitting room are all transferred from the General Post Office and have no direct receiving rights. In addition to telegrams transmitted by telephone, the post office also delivers them. The transmission between the post office and the receiving and transmitting room is aided by vacuum tubes, so there is no delay in incoming and outgoing telegrams. Outgoing telegrams are transmitted from the post office to the receiving and transmitting room through vacuum tubes, and then directly sent to the reporter's workstation through vacuum tubes. There are a total of fourteen communication locations, among which there are three in East Asia: Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tokyo. London is the busiest in terms of report affairs, with about 2,000 incoming and outgoing reports every day. Three machines are used simultaneously when busy. The fatigue length used between London and Paris is 2200 meters to 900 meters. New York telegrams were also very busy, but now that an agreement has been established with the Water Line Company, most of the telegrams are sent by the Water Line. The receiving and transmitting machines of the Water Line Company are also located in the room and work with New York at the same time. Overall, the equipment of the station, except for the use of vacuum tubes to transmit incoming and outgoing telegrams, and the layout of the receiving and transmitting room, seem to be far inferior to my international radio station and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The research laboratory of the Standard Electric Company is located in Paris, and its main factory is in London. Whenever there is a new invention in engineering, the research laboratory first makes a model and then hands it over to the main factory in London for manufacturing. The current work of the research laboratory, in terms of wireless radio, is the ultra-short wave (Ultra Short Wamve) and the Micro Ray experiment, and the manufacture of light bulbs above 50kw. It is said that the test room has used I8cm to test the telegram with London. The test has been carried out for several months, and the results are very good. The method is to set up two i8cm radio stations at a distance of about thirty miles, and then transfer them separately through landlines to London and Paris. The room is also planning a new type of wireless radio typewriter (Radio Jeleprinaer). Each English letter is composed of points generated by seven different wavelengths. The one we saw was the second model made by the company, and it will soon be seen in practical use. As for transmitting light bulbs, those below 50kw are manufactured in London, and those that are particularly large are manufactured in Paris. The light bulbs with the largest power can reach 300kw.</p>
<h3 id="e298">Explanation of Telegraph Terminology <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>In the manuscripts published in this journal and the various telegraph business regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Communications, there are often telegraph business terms. To make it easier for readers to understand, the most commonly used terms are annotated below:</p>
<p>Sending Bureau: The telegraph bureau that sends the telegram. The place name written in the "Name of Sending Bureau" column at the top of the incoming telegram form is the name of the sending bureau.</p>
<p>Receiving Bureau: The telegraph bureau that delivers the telegram.</p>
<p>Transmitting Bureau: The intermediate telegraph bureau that relays the telegram.</p>
<p>Sender: The person who sends the telegram. Whether it is a private business, a firm, or an organization, all are referred to as the sender.</p>
<p>Recipient: The person who receives the telegram.</p>
<p>Payment Indication: In addition to ordinary, urgent, and news telegrams, there are various special delivery methods that can be used. For example, to avoid transmission errors, the telegraph bureau can be asked to proofread the telegram during transmission. Such telegrams should be marked with "TC." If a reply fee is prepaid, the telegram is marked with "RP······." These marks are called payment indications.</p>
<p>Payment Official Telegram: If the recipient has questions after receiving the telegram, they can send a payment official telegram, which is more cost-effective than sending an ordinary telegram to inquire. (Starting this year, for the convenience of the public, the Ministry of Communications has specially approved free inquiries for telegrams with doubtful content. However, inquiries about the sender's name, etc., are still subject to fees.) If the sender needs to correct, supplement, or cancel a telegram that has already been sent, they can also send a payment official telegram.</p>
<p>Bureau Station: A simplified term for telegraph bureaus and wireless radio stations.</p>
<p>Telegram: A simplified term for telegram. For example, "outgoing telegram" refers to a telegram that has been sent, and "incoming telegram" refers to a telegram that has been received. The telegraph bureau does not use the character "電" (diàn, electricity) but uses the character "報" (bào, report) as a simplification of "電報" (diànbào, telegram) to distinguish it from "電話" (diànhuà, telephone), as the simplification of "電話" is "話" (huà, speech) instead of "電." Furthermore, business places that also handle telephone services are abbreviated as "報話營業處" (bàohuà yíngyèchù, telegraph and telephone business offices), which is more appropriate than using the character "電."

<p>Strict Inspection of the Business of Various Receiving and Sending Offices</p>
<p>Previously, in order to facilitate the public, the Ministry of Communications specially established many receiving and sending offices in major commercial ports. These receiving and sending offices are generally far from the central bureau. Whether the staff in these offices are dedicated to their duties, whether they strictly adhere to business hours, whether they treat the public who send telegrams with courtesy, and whether they calculate change for telegram fees according to the announced rates all require regular inspection to facilitate business. The Ministry of Communications has now specifically formulated a "Methods for Inspecting Telegraph Bureau Receiving and Sending Offices" and ordered all telegraph bureaus to comply with it. It is expected that all receiving and sending offices will provide services as thorough as the central bureau, to benefit the public.</p>
<p>Official Military Telegram Paper Must Be Signed by the Supervising Officer</p>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Communications found that official military telegrams from various telegraph bureaus were rampant, which not only hindered the rapid transmission of commercial telegrams but also often delayed important official military telegrams. It was specifically stipulated that, in the future, when personnel from various agencies send official military telegrams on business trips, the supervising officer must first sign or stamp the telegram paper in advance to show caution and avoid redundancy. The Ministry of Communications has submitted this measure to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the National Government for promulgation to all political and military agencies, to be implemented starting in January of next year.</p>
<p>Revising the Calculation Standard for Long-Distance Telephone Rates</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Communications has actively constructed long-distance telephone lines in various places, and the business has developed rapidly. Currently, the old long-distance telephone rates are mostly based on line length, so the rates between two places that are very close in distance are often very high because the lines are not direct but circuitous. In recent years, the construction of highways in various provinces has been rapidly advancing, and the original rates are mostly unsuitable. In order to make fees fair and to develop telephone services, the Ministry of Communications has decided to reorganize long-distance telephone rates, using spatial distance as the standard, and to limit the duration of each call to three minutes. The Beijing-Baoding, Tianjin-Jinan-Yushulin, Tianjin-Jinan, Jinan-Qingdao, Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and the telephone lines in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces will be implemented first. The specific implementation date will be announced after the rates have been finalized.</p>
