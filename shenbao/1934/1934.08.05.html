<h3 id="c14">日蘇風雲緊急之觀測敬 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>當兹中東路買賣商談若斷若續期間。日蘇關係又復顯示險惡狀態。據哈瓦斯通信社消息。日本憲兵在綏芬河車站及其他驛站。逮捕俄籍職員二十餘人。并準備擴大拘捕之範圍。寶係出於有計劃動作。迴非偶然發生者可比。而蘇聯飛機不斷偵察蘇「滿」邊境。亦已引起日僞雙方之抗議。至於蘇方移動界石之說。雖出於日方宣傳。未可盡信。而經此煊染。又將增加多少之嚴重性。則在意料中也。日蘇雙方。陳兵耀武。準備萬一。形勢之危急。固不自今日始。去年年底。有人視察中東路兩端。目擊日蘇備戰之熱烈。曾云。今年夏季。戰禍難免。一若大戰果已有動機也者。</p>
<p>本年入春以後。戰爭之可能性。愈見增大。第一。日本積極修築東北各省區之鐵道及公路。除吉會路已完成敦圖一段外。更有所謂七大鐵道幹綫之計劃。其中尤以熱河鐵道及洮索鐵道。爲最有軍事之意味。前者用以控制内蒙。後者用以扼守興安嶺。其餘如縱横全境之公路。亦莫不以戰爭爲目標而决定其修築之路綫。第二。最近日軍在承德召集會議。參加者多屬於中堅幹部。而主其事者。復爲著名之侵略家土肥原氏。日人沿長城增兵。事旣明顯。而侵奪内蒙。尤具决心。考其用意。無非欲雙管齊下。一方面引誘蒙人入彼懷抱。他方面卽乘機進兵。直趨外蒙。以爲對蘇作戰之先聲。第三。中東路沿綫日本原有重兵。今春復借換防之名。以第三及十六兩大師團。移駐哈爾濱黑龍江等地。併附以特科部隊。如航空隊坦克車隊等。應有盡有。配成戰時組織。其駐兵數目及分配詳情。則均嚴守秘密。絶不外洩。由其動作之緊張。可見其備戰之積極。第四。日雖蓄意戰爭。但仍畏空軍襲擊。海參巖與日本京濱巨鎭。距離甚近。更覺防禦不易。故加緊空防。不遺餘力。設非明知戰禍不免。何苦亟亟於此。</p>
<p>由此種種。遂覺日蘇風雲愈見緊急。惟蘇聯自實施第二次五年計劃以來。專心於國内之建設。是以免力求四境之安定。對西歐如是。對遠東亦然。有時雖顯露鋒芒。針對日本。然亦僅爲一種示威警告。殊非有意於啟釁也。蓋蘇聯而能保持和平。以其建設成績昭示於資本主義之世界。則其所得必將倍蓰於戰爭。是以苟非受人攻繫。當不至有越境攻人之理。惟日本軍閥好大喜功。九一八後。更以爲世界之大無我敵手。幸其一般國民久已創深痛鉅。是以反對戰爭之心理。日益濃厚。惟不敢出之於口舌。僅於間接方面以表示其憤懣而已。一旦戰爭發生。假令出兵二百萬。則日費卽須四千萬圓日金之鉅。綜計一月所費將超過彼一年之經常收入。日閥之野心雖大。亦必不敢漫無顧忌。東北境内。問題猶多。而軍部之内。派别不一。將來初期作戰。或能勉强應付。迨時日稍久。勝負即難預料。是以目前日蘇間之緊張空氣。尚不足爲兩國卽將火併之左證也。</p>

<p>島内日系市民最占勢力</p>
<p>併入聯邦遲早終必實現</p>
<p>火奴魯魯通訊、此次美大總統羅斯福之訪問檀香山、在遠東局面微妙莫測之今日、實爲一耐人尋味之事、其訪問目的果若何耶、吾人在推測之先試先一觀檀香山之歷史及其現狀、</p>
<p>歷史檀香山係由大小二十島構成、其中十一島爲無人島、一百五十六年前、由英人詹姆士科克發見、在其後十九世紀之大半、保持其檀香山王國之地位、一八九三年成爲共和國、一九○○年麥金萊大總統時代、正式合併於美國、其面積合併全島、尚不及日本之四國、除無人島外、其總面積爲六千四百五十四平方哩、至檀香山全島人口、據一九三○年之調查、爲三十六萬八千三百三十六人、而目下之推定數則爲三十八萬二百十一人、</p>
<p>人種由人種别而觀、檀香山居民中、包含日人一四六·○九二、（内朝鮮人六·四六一）菲列賓人六三·○五二、白人（美英德俄人）四四·八九五、與檀香山人間之混血兒二八·二二四、葡萄牙人二七·五八八、中國人二七·一七九、西班牙人一·二一九、其他七·三五一、</p>
<p>雖網羅如斯各種之人種、然從來並無人種的偏見及戰鬥發生、被目爲太平洋上之和平鄕、以汛太平洋會議之發祥地著稱於世、迨至一九三二年九月麥妥希海軍中尉夫人事件發生、中國人二名菲列濱人及日本人被目爲嫌疑犯、引起車大糾紛、於是白人對亞洲人種之對立關係、亦趨於激化、</p>
<p>市民檀香山與阿拉斯加及菲列濱等土地相同、異於美國國内之各州、係作爲美國之外府、其司法行政、可謂悉由大總統所任命之知事裁判官支配之、但有上下議院各一、上院議員爲任期四年之十五人、下院議員爲任期二年之三十人、目下在下院中、有日系市民之議員四人、又在郡會中亦有日系市民之議員、在全島三十六萬住民内、具有市民權者約二十三萬六千五百人、其内容計日人八七·七○○、白人四二·○○○、檀香山人及其混血兒四七·七○○、菲列濱人一五·六○○、中國人一五·六○○、</p>
<p>觀上表、具有市民權者以日本人爲最多、計佔三分之一以上、且今後有增加之趨勢、目下在美國聯邦議會内、檀香山方面雖亦派出代表、然無投票權、依目下情勢血觀、檀香山之終將作爲美國内部之一州而確立其州權、實爲遲早必須實現之事實、羅斯福利用訪問檀香山之機會、關於其州權確立問題從事實地調查、實爲顯明之事實、如一旦州權確立、則檀香山將由上下院各派議員一名至聯邦會議、而屆時入選議員之爲日系市民蓋不難想像、（待續）</p>

<p>抵部情形萍鄕民衆、聞喻匪魁就擒咸次一覩爲快、故押解喻匪抵縣時、民衆相率來觀、爭先恐後、一時縱隧司令部門首、滿坑滿谷、途爲之塞、</p>
<p>喻匪身世喻匪爲湖南平江謝　人、現年二十六歲、身林軍小鷙悍、兩目稜梭有光、雖面黧髮　、但毫無畏縮之狀、曾充僱農二年、後隨乃父架船爲生、並曾在三十五軍三師七園二營當兵二載、父業船户、尚存、家有髮妻、</p>
<p>爲匪經歷民十七年、喻匪在平江擔任鄕農恊曾工作、參加赤匪暴動、十八年、經高詠生介紹、加入共黨○、任平江游擊隊隊長、十九年攻長沙時、任赤衛隊隊長、二十年任湘鄂贛省赤色警衛營營長、二十一年冬、任湘鄂贛軍區獨立團團長、兼中共修銅宜奉常委、二十二年春季、充湘鄂贛省蘇第二屆執委、任修銅宜奉軍事部長、同年八月、調任湘鄂贛軍匪紅軍獨立第一師師長、十月十五日、僞省蘇第三次工農兵代表大會、又當選爲執委、去秋迭被團剿、實力損失、本年二月、縮編爲湘鄂贛省赤色獨立第四團、改任團長、歷年對國軍抗戰不下數百次、裏槍數百、負傷三次、在宜豐修水銅鼓奉新高安等縣工作最久、亦復甚力、</p>
<p>生平特長喻匪體格强悍、力能摶虎、善拳技、長游泳、平日格鬥、雖十數人莫能與敵、擴悍梟鷙、是其天性、</p>
<p>兩獲特奬該匪除平江老家聚有髮妻外、曾於十八年由省蘇婚姻部介紹與紅軍學校畢業任宜豐縣婦女部長唐愈結婚、去年黃沙之役、唐在逍遥被七十七師俘去、本年二月、經省蘇介紹、與陳英同居、陳係瀏陽産、爲一中學生、在紅軍學校肄業、喜軍事、亦能戰、俟該校試騐期滿即將正式發給結婚證書、（按匪結婚、並無儀式、一由縣蘇或省蘇發給結婚證書、婚姻便告成立、）不圖天網恢恢、好夢未圓即被俘獲也、</p>
<p>被俘經過劉膺古自駐贛西進剿以來、迭建殊績、高匪詠生授首前後、匪中首要被俘及投誠者、不可勝計、本年四月間、曾令岳師設法招致喻匪、未果、不期七月十日、喻匪竟率所部竄踞修水黃沙港之蛇林坑地方、經密報、由岳師二九九團、派第三營於十三日窮追搜剿、匪已潰不成軍、該匪即率所部濳居黃沙崗嶺上、該嶺綿延達百餘里、山勢高峻、有四十八條水澗之險、該營在該嶺竟一晝夜搜索之力、始在一洞中發覺、當時該匪尚有衛隊二十餘人、頑强抵抗、肉摶多時、方全數繳械、將喻匪行舟·及交通員楊永標等五名、一同擒獲、經投誠人文某、分别認明屬實、方押解返部、電呈層峯報告、</p>
<p>審前談話記者曾與喻匪談話、記者問、「你爲什麽要爲匪作惡、」喻匪答、「我没有讀書、不懂得政治、我的行動、完全是聽政委指揮的、現在被擒到此、才知道這裏是光明之路、」問、「你當師長在何時、」答、「我當師長是步步升上來的、平時中共對我很滿意、屢次派政治人員和我談話、大概認我有三個優點、一是僱農階級、二有數年奮鬥歷史、三政治信仰堅定、但我自已認定衝鋒陷陣、是我的長處、帶兵確有把握、是我的本領、」言時輙作獰笑、似少悔禍之意、</p>
<p>僞師長喻行舟</p>

<p>全國財政會議决議案實施報告</p>
<p>丨財政部整理地方捐稅委員會編丨</p>
<p>一緒言</p>
<p>此次財政會議議决各案、已在第一號實施報告中、將財政部處理之過程、摘要報告、所有重要各案、均能於七月一日以前理有頭緒、開始進行此後如何推展盡利、各省市政府所負實際執行之責任爲多、一月以來、所得各方關於廢除苛捐雜稅之文報、其推進實績、有足公告國人者、爰爲分省編列以資參證、此外另有應行注意之點凡七、並爲列舉如次、</p>
<p>一·各案之實施、自必有相當手續、各省市處境不同情形亦異、勢非一蹴可幾、本期所宣佈之各省報告、仍係財會閉幕後儘先表示者、此後自邇而遐、循序漸進當有以慰國人之期待、</p>
<p>二·廢除苛雜、不能離整理地方財政而進行、必須通盤籌劃、逐步策進、方能澈底生效、本期所有報告、一方面僅足表示與民更始、其實非澈底整理、不能廓清地方多年之財政積弊、以斬除苛雜之根、</p>
<p>三·此次議决案中整理田賦及舉辦土地陳報、均其重要者、現各省多正在召集會議、詳定實施細則、將來正式報告到部後、即陸續刋佈、</p>

<p>五·中央抵補地方之烟酒牌照稅、已於七月一日撥歸地方、自地方政府直接辦理後、因以地方行政權作有力之推動、稅收均有增加、此於抵補方面裨益不少、至印花稅抵補一案、亦已定有分撥辦法、只視各省廢除苛雜情形如何、即實行核明撥補、</p>
<p>六·各省市捐稅監理委員會、中央極爲重視、人選亦極須愼重、現經博訪周諮、擬有初步之名單、自下月起、各地監會當可次第成立、</p>
<p>七·實地視察爲明瞭地方財政之急務、冀晋魯陜豫各省及平津兩市、均經本部孔部長躬親前往視察、其察綏江浙皖贛甘寗夏等省、亦已派委員分别前往、此外各省亦在陸續遴派中、</p>
<p>時日易逝、財會閉幕後將兩月矣、距七月一日實施廢除苛雜之期、亦一月矣在此期問、負責人員雖皆曼惕奮勉、罔敢怠忽、而衡以國人此次期望之殷、現在報告、或不能答其萬一、惟是整理地方財政、範圍旣廣、頭緒亦繁、財部人員、固不敢以事務之艱煩而畏難自餒、尤不敢以責在地方、而稍存輕懈、各省市財政當局對於實施財會决議各案、均無不努力事功、認眞邁進、深信此後當續有事實證明、以饜國人、</p>

<p>丨丨答顧千里君</p>
<p>（一）世界是人類的舞臺</p>
<p>國際問題是什麽？在回答這問題前，先要提出解决的是什麽是我們的世界？國除問題是發生這個世界内的，是這「世界」舞台扮演的拿手好戲，所以在談戲前，先要交代的是這舞台了。</p>
<p>通常所謂世界是指直徑約三千二百四十里，面積約三千三百萬里的地球。牠十分中之二分九二是陸地，七分七是海洋。它是一切生物的住家，人類的大舞台。</p>
<p>在這一個球面上，除開南極的一千四百萬方基羅咪達和北極二百萬方基羅咪達之外，大概都有人類，現在的人口的總數約十七億。</p>
<p>這舞台是誰建築的呢？是偉大的自然先生。在人類未到世界以前就是存在的。它的歷史太悠遠了，我們暫時不去管他。但人類何時來到這舞台的呢？說來這也話長，我們知道，他們在這舞台上扮出「像樣」的戲已經有六七千年了，在這以前約五十萬至一百萬年，這舞台的確就有了他們的足跡，演過比他們的表兄弟丨丨猿猴丨丨輩要高明的角色。可是道些舊賬，在本書内也不能詳細交代了。</p>
<p>人類對於這舞台的認識不用說是經過了一個很長的過程的。不要說六七千年以前人類所認識的世界不是現在的世界，即八九十年前中國人所認識的世界也就不是今日的世界了。過去的世界舞台因爲被海洋，山脈，江河，沙漢等舞台的裝置所阻擬了，人類被天然的限製，一羣團的一羣團的各自生活在一種小的環境内，羣團相互問很少交通的關係，於是各自就認那小的天地爲世界，他們並不知道他們認識的世界不過是整體的一個碎片，他們以外還有更大的世界，同他們一樣生活着的兄弟。（未完）</p>

<p>昨在大中華電臺播音</p>
<p>上海市敎育　、於昨日下午四時半在大中華電臺播音、由潘局長講職業敎育、原詞如下、</p>
<p>職業敎育、經各方面的提倡與努力、到現在似有蓬勃的現象、然而職業敎育到底是什麽、一般人現尚在糊模中、我仍如果要解答這個問題、一定要先知道敎育是什麽、而職業又是什麽、敎育我仍可以說它是社會的上層建築物、它是隨社會環境和經濟的條件變化而變化的、它的任務、須適合時代的要求完成時代的使命、培植後代的青年去繼續前時代的事務、所以敎育的内容目的以及形式、各時代都有不同也、就這個原故、至於職業兩字、照辭源引史記上用法看來、職業乃分内應爲之事也、可照韋氏大字典的註解可以譯作、凡是對於社會所盡的一種役務毋論是間接直接增加生産力的、就呌着職業、</p>
<p>吾人旣明白了敎育和職業的解釋、那麽職業敎育是什麽、就極容易解决了、我們可以說、用敎育的方法使人人獲得適當的職業、俾成社會健全份子、這就呌做職業敎育、而其目的也就是使無業及失業的人變成有業、使有業的鞏固及增進地位、爲國家及社會增加生産力、現在有許多人、因爲將於職業敎育成功的因素分析不清以爲技術敎育就是職業育、不過是敎授些關於各種手藝的技術而已矣、其實不然、職業敎育的成功技能、固屬是其中主要要素的一種、但是除此以外還得要有很充分的基本常識、同時除了普通常識和專門技能以外、還得要有相當的性格、所爲技術敎育、不過是能增加一點生産能力而已、但不能保障職業生活的圓滿、我們若祇能生産而没有性情品格以及道德觀念來調和指導、那人就等於機器了、所以技術不過是職業敎育的一部、而並非整個的職業敎育、這是值得應該特别注意的一點、</p>
<p>職業敎育的解釋旣如上述、而它的起源也就不能不略加研究了、職業敎育的起源、廣義的講可以說是起於人類有職業的時候、有了職業、便須敎人繼續一代一代的遺傳下去、不過現今之所謂職業敎育、其來源有如下述、（一）課程内容的藝術化、十七世紀中葉歐洲有著名的敎家ＬockeComenius等主張敎育不應當注重課本、而應注意實際、所以提倡覺官訓練、到盧梭的時候、他便主張身體活動、不僅是强身、並應使覺感靈敏、手腦聯運、他在「愛彌兒」裏提講用調查工商業的方法、使兒童了解社會實際狀况、並應使兒童在家庭和學校裏練習木工、到了斐斯太洛齊、使實行起來、算是課程藝術化的第一次試騐、後來繼續着有Ｆellenbery同Ｆrocbel等了、到了十九世紀漸趨普及、而尤以北歐洲國爲最盛如俄國之工訓練、瑞典丹麥挪成芬蘭等國之所謂技術制度是也、（二）學校敎育的職業化、因爲最近學校畢業或肄業的學生、到社會裏去無一技之長、有畢業即失業之口號、如此反變成高等游民、於是一般辦敎育者、不得不設法救濟、而他們認爲唯、的救濟方法、就是祇有在學校内設職業課程、以彌補這個缺限</p>
<p>在西洋學校職業化的盛行、要算美國、美國之所以如此、是由於莫和兒案、提倡、這個案的動議是因爲有一位杜納兒敎授創議把政府的官地撥給各州作開辦實業學校的經費、於一八六二年經林肯簽字、自此以後美國的職業學校乃蒸蒸日上、其他如日本則仿效美國、而中國又仿效日本、近則更取法於歐美各國、一切的一切現正積極實行</p>
<p>職業敎育有了十面三大原因直到最近以來、漸趨一致、在歐美大有普遍之勢、而在中國雖經各方努力提　、似有蓬勃氣象、但困難情形、仍屬不少、（一）觀念的陳腐、（二）學生入學與出路之困難、（三）受社會的牽制等、上述困難情形如不能設法解除、則職業敎育、實難有普及之希望也、</p>

<h3 id="c203">儲蓄 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>儲蓄是把節省下來的金錢積存起來，因爲一個人生在世上，當然免不了生災害病，和一切意外的事故。如果平時没有儲蓄，怎能應付這種意外的事故呢？所以儲蓄實在是一種美德。</p>
<p>儲蓄的方法，大略可分爲兩種：一種是存整數的；一種是存零數的；前一種必須經濟寛裕的人纔能辦到，後一種是任何人都可辦到的。譬如有一個小朋友，他父親每天給他一角大洋，作爲點心和糖菓錢，他呢？每天祇用二十枚銅元，省下十枚來儲蓄，逢逢到月終，就換成一塊銀洋，送到銀行裏存起來。像這樣的永不間斷，到十五年的時候，他就有一筆四百一十七元的存欵了。並且這存欵裏面，祗有一百八十元的本金，那二百三十七元，都是利息，這就是聚零成整，集腋成裘的辦法。假如這小朋友每天不積存十枚銅元的話，當然就不會有這筆存欵了。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們願意儲蓄嗎？那末請你們就自今天起來儲蓄，如果每天能夠儲蓄十枚銅元更好，否則五枚，三枚也都可以的。祗要時候久了，自然會有一筆整數的。</p>

<p>放了暑假，天氣眞熱哪。弟弟是一個聰敏的孩了，他設立了一個家庭動物院。</p>
<p>這家庭動物院是怎樣的呢？：</p>
<p>在屋前的草地上，有花有樹，還有放着盆景的木架。動物院的院址就在這兒。</p>
<p>弟弟把呌哥哥連籠子掛在冬青樹上，把金魚缸搬在草地中間，將琳琳的屋子從在門口搬過來，讓它在屋子傍站着汪汪的吠呌。把大鉛盆盛滿了水，將小鴨子捉進去游泳，更把屋後的白公鷄，肥母鷄，雛鷄趕了來。還到隣居處惜來一隻鸚鵡，四隻芙蓉，讓它們連架，連籠地掛在楷杷樹上。我們的白花大貓，也給弟弟捉了來，用帶子縳住，因爲恐怕它要咬小鴨和小鷄的，該它倒霉。</p>
<p>我們的家庭動物院開幕了，弟弟和妹妹邀了許多小朋友，到我們這裏來參觀。</p>
<p>在每種動物旁，我們把寫着它種類名稱的硬紙片用繩子縳在上面，以便參觀者的參考。</p>

<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>到了現在，天空已成爲人類交通之用了！在科學發遠的國家，有許多飛行器具日夜不斷地在兩個城市之間，或是兩個以上的城市間的空中飛航着。就是在我們中國，也時常可見幾架中外商合營的飛行機在空中飛航。</p>
<p>在中國，有許多名詞是不統一的。單就飛行器具的名詞而言：我們見有一隻單翼陸上飛機在空中飛着，大家都喊：「看呀！飛艇來了！」但是一隻雙翼水小飛機在天空進行時，大家又喊：「看呀！飛艇來了！」他們把兩種東西都呌做「飛艇」。這實在是錯誤的！各位小朋友：你們辨得清楚麽？</p>
<p>其實，要分别飛行器具的種類，這是一椿很容易的事情，現在：我把所知的幾種，畫了出來。這樣，看了以後大致再不會把飛行器具的名稱弄錯了。</p>
<p>這圖中的飛行器具，除了飛船，飛艇，氣球以外，其餘幾種都是我們在空中見過的，此外還有滑翔機……因無完善美好的成績，故不列入。至於飛行機用途之名稱，如戰圖飛機，轟炸飛機，商用飛機等名詞，亦不列入。</p>

<p>大部分的昆蟲，都是吃植物的葉枝過活的；另外有一部分的昆蟲，是吃肉來維持生命的。不過它們所吃的肉，並不是像我們人類所吃的牛肉猪肉一樣，而是小形的動物丨尤其是昆蟲。兹舉幾種常見的如左！</p>
<p>一、蜻蜓　有透明强大的翅膀，飛舞空中，用牠銳利堅固的口器，捕捉小蟲，作爲食餌。它的幼蟲呌做水躉，也是捉取孑孓等小蟲爲食。</p>
<p>二、螳螂　用變成刀狀的第一對脚來捕捉昆蟲爲食。</p>
<p>三、蜘蛛　也是捕蟲爲食，它捕蟲的工具，是用絲造成的網。</p>

<p>— 顔鑫泉</p>
<p>在前一期的兒童周刋裏，刋着一篇子凈先生的「簡易的氣球」製法和玩法；依子凈先生的宗旨，無非要使兒童知道氣的作用，那是很值得欽佩的。不過這玩法没有說得完備，因爲氣球昇到半空，不免要隨着風向吹去，就是吹到一里路外，也未可知。記得六七年前，有幾個人（是成人）也玩着這個玩意兒，待氣球昇到空中後，隨着風向吹去，直望到看不見了氣球，各人纔興盡散去是：第二天某鄕村傳來一個消息，說天火燒，天上掉下一團火而起火的，燒去茅屋十多間。</p>
<p>所以請在曠塲上玩這氣球的小朋友，須要在氣球底下生上一根細綫，以防危險，最多給它昇到一二丈高，這樣玩法已很够味，而且也安全了許多。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們平日經過勞動後，或因氣候炎熱，皮膚上就要流出潮濕濕的汗來了。然而汗的成分是什麽樣的呢？我把汗的常識，簡單的說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）汗的分泌，汗是在眞皮與皮下組織中的汗腺出來的，汗腺的周圍，有血管週轉，從血管内的血液濾出到皮膚的表面汗腺口，排出體外的，我們全身汗腺之數，大約有二百五萬根，所以無論那部分，都有汗腺密佈的，可是汗的多少，依季節與人而不同，普通成人，一晝夜，約出了半里脫爾（Ｌitre等於中國一升○八勺）以上一里脫爾以下的量。（二）汗的成分，汗以水分占大部分，又含有脂肪，鹽分，尿素等。因此汗味是鹹的，出汗以後，因爲尿素與脂肪分解，變爲阿姆尼亞，發生汗臭氣。（三）汗的作用，出汗是從血液中除去無用成分清潔血液的，並能調節體温。夏季普通人的身體，出過了汗，可以减低四五百加羅里（Ｃaloric熱的單位）體温，就感得凉爽了。所以夏天的身體，表面隂凉，我國醫生，對於發熱的病人，用國藥表散解熱，病人服藥後，出了一身大汗，就可以退熱的，也是這個理由，（四）汗與神經的關係，大凡身體肥胖的人，保持體温的脂肪層，在皮下很厚，到了夏季，因多放散體温，故出汗遂多。倘若我們精神上突然不痛快，血管收縮，神經亢奮，皮膚變爲蒼白色，因發汗神經的作用，要出冷汗，瀕死時的脫汗，就是這緣故。又若身體不適，必定常常剌激發汗神經，要多出汗，出此汗時，身體反而不舒服。他如患血汗症時，汗中多帶血液，患糖尿病時，汗中多帶糖分，這都是不正當的出汗。（五）汗與鞋襪的關係，脚底的汗腺很多，分泌出來的汗，因受鞋襪的裏緊，毫不通風，所以一脫了鞋襪，汗的脂肪尿素，分解愈速，異臭四溢，因此每日應當多洗足換襪。（六）汗斑的發生，皮膚表面如多出了汗，長時間積留在皮膚，不就洗去，那皮膚受汗的剌激，遂發生紅色的汗斑，若不預防，蔓延很快，所以我們出汗以後，應當洗　消毒，用撲粉吸收水分，那末，旣可以保持身體清潔，又可預防疾病發生。</p>

<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>——給新女性——</p>
<p>前進的女士：</p>
<p>您一定知道的：凖確的命題不怕多方面的觀察；一加一等於二：隨你怎樣算，凖不會錯。我們不是企圖從各方面去說明眞正的婦女解放的道路嗎？女性無論要取得社會地位的平等，經濟的獨立，禮敎的解放，合理的性道德標凖等，路還是很清楚的祗有一條：要建立一個新的社會。</p>
<p>本來，社會制度是人類最大的謎，是鐘裏邊的發條，把它一解答，一弄好，什麽都不成間題了。然而要改良一個社會制度其中的過程是非常艱難的；最大的問題，便是缺少一個新的標凖，舊社會的一切道德的，善惡的，賢與不肖的標凖是必然地不適合於新的社會了；而另外建立一個新的標凖，雖然是急切地必需的，然而，却也是十分不容易的。</p>
<p>我們該把話講得具體化一點：譬如說：我們現在聽見過去的三從四德下的「賢母良妻」的名詞，一定會把它看作像毒藥一般的吧？然而那舊社會，縱說是没有惡意的，也該向我們發問：「難道新的人不需要賢母良妻，而需要劣妻惡母的嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣一來，不但舊社會中發問的人越弄越糊塗，恐怕連我們自已都難以具體的回答了？</p>
<p>而實際，這是不成問題的問題，爽快的地回答：「新的時代，新的社會中，我們也需要賢母良妻，和舊社會中一樣的需要。所不同者，就是賢與良這二個字的意義有了本質上的不同而已」：那便是說：「賢與良的新舊觀點和標凖是絶對不同的。</p>
<p>我們要想在封建的社會制度中脫身，我們也該明白封建社會的本質和它底善惡的標凖的基礎。舊社會的經濟的分配方法是不平均的，利益與權力總是落在享受經濟的潤餘的一邊，因之女子便永遠是男子的佔有品，他們對女子的唯一要求便是服從，和代他們敎育出一班從他們的後代女性。因之妻的「良」，良在三從四德，母的「賢」，賢在敎子有方。賢好的母親，不但自身應受人支配，服從别人，而且還得代他們敎育出支配别的女性的兒子，與服從别的男子的女兒。</p>
<p>這便是說：他們呌每個女性去造築幽禁她自身的堅牆，束縛她自身的梏桎。</p>
<p>多殘酷的悲劇哪。</p>
<p>母親是多够值得驕傲的啊，因爲她掌執着下一代的命運；又都够恐懼的啊，也因爲她掌執了下一代的命運。</p>
<p>今天以前我們所看到的所謂賢母良妻，都是敎下一代的男子去支配下一代的女子，而又敎下一代的女子去服從下一代的男子的大儍子啊。</p>
<p>自已造幽禁自已的圍牆的儍事，我們希望（而且相信）今後的世界上是再也看不到的了。在未來的新的社會上，我們也需要賢母良妻，我們要的是自已「拆掉」圍牆的聰明的新母親！</p>
<p>然而，早已說過，近代的婦女解放不是「男子爭鬥」的喜劇，而是想個社會的（簡直是男女共同的）大問題。新的女性，除了自身的奮鬥之外，應當把後代的目光移向社會制度的不合理上面去的。</p>
<p>「把你們底子女造成一羣對大衆有點用處的人！」</p>
<p>唯有這種的母敎，才是合理的，前進的，而是新的社會所期待着的。</p>
<p>新的良妻，會知道把自身從家庭的束縛中解放出來而走向社會去的；新的賢母會知道去敎她底後代繼續着她底艱難的路程的。</p>
<p>這樣，你看：我們不是也一樣的需要賢母良妻的嗎？然而，這却是合理的。</p>
<p>前進的女士啊，驕傲吧，恐懼吧，因爲你們是握着下一代的命運的啊。</p>

<p>— 兹九</p>
<p>並答師石君</p>
<p>關於「托兒所與兒童公育」師石君曾兩度評論，筆者亦曾兩度爲文檢討，七月十三日本報本埠增刋上又有師石君的「三談托兒所與公育」一文。通讀全文，覺得師石君不能以客觀的態度，採取駁論者所持的理由，來加檢討，而一味以主觀的見解，反復說他自已要說的話。這已失去了討論的性質，筆者本已不願再費筆墨，同時相信：育兒出婦女問題之一角，亦是社會問題的一大環，對本問題的論爭，是是非非，讀者總會想評價。果於七月三十一日的時事新報的「現代婦女」上，有譚霜萍君的「托兒所與兒童公育問題」一文，對師石君的「三談托兒所與兒童公育」詳加論駁，筆者除慶幸已得到共鳴外，更稍加補充，共同質諸師石君，並求熱心於社會問題者的公論。</p>
<p>（一）綜讀師石君前後三文，根本的錯誤，在於將現代的所謂兒童公育，以爲就是古代斯巴達的兒童國有，所以戰戰兢兢以爲兒童公一旦公育，就是失去了怙恃，父母從此斷絶了膝下承歡。但常識告訴我們，所謂兒童公育，絶不是這樣一回事，簡單地下個定義：就是國家拿出錢來，科學化的，集團化的，爲人民養育子女，與國家拿出錢來辦小學，辦中學大學同樣意義，丨丨那末子女之入公育下的托兒所，何曾與父母絶了緣？所以這正是造福家庭，尊重人生意義，更何嘗是違迕了自然的衍化了？且就已經施行公育的蘇聯來說，他們何嘗父母已完全抛葉了子女，或子女一入托兒所，卽失去父母？現在師石君的意思，似乎將蘇聯現在所施行的代育方法以爲尚不是眞正公育丨丨自然他們的方法，也許尚在改良過程中，但這是方法的問題，與本問題無關丨丨但師石君初次論「托兒亦與兒童公育」一文中曾有「兒童公育在歐美頗呈活躍更能切實施行著有成効，……」之詞，今次師右君，忽又否認了，所以有：一在公育的原則下舉辦的托兒所，現時恐怕只有蘇聯，而他們的代育亦祇是「寄養」不與公育本旨相符」的妙論，誠不知師石君的所謂公育，究竟是怎麽一回事？</p>
<p>（二）有托兒所，不一定可認爲卽是公育，而實施兒童公育的國家，必得普設托兒所？這是必然的事，國家應社會的需要，而創辦勞働托兒所，可認爲這是施行公育的先聲，爲解放婦女計，爲社會前途計，兒童公育實屬必要的。且現實告訴我們中國現在已有托兒所的設立，這已明示我們其間的需要，不完備的如育嬰堂孤兒院貧兒所等，尚且如此地爲社會所需求，能有公育下的完備托兒所，不將更孚人望嗎？所以筆者以爲除非男子們的自私自利，以爲一切女子都只有養育子女的本能，而將未來的主人翁，硬生生地受不良敎育以外，若對於社會的進展，有明確的認識的話，對托兒所與兒童公育，當認爲有實施的必要的。所以問題，不在中國現制度下是否應施行公育，而是能不能完全施行公育的問題。在一切敎育尚在商品化的現在，要普遍施行公育當然是不可能的。不過我們可不能因爲它不可能而就此來反對。</p>
<p>（三）師石君本次論文中，已將歐美現有的托兒所，承認只是改良的育嬰堂而已，那末師石君所引證的美國名社會家愛　華特著述中的巴黎公育兒童死亡率，亦不能算作眞正公育的例證了。</p>
<p>總之：筆者並非要與師石君爲難，實因師石君的宏論，有着相當的謬誤，誠如譚霜萍君所謂：「爲了愛護眞理」，不得不與師石君作析疑上之檢討。這是筆者三次爲文論駁的初衷。讀者當能公鑒丨同時我希望讀者，對這問題，多多發表意見。</p>

<p>— 樂基</p>
<p>——奈度夫人——</p>
<p>談起被壓迫民族中的偉人，吾想大家都不會忘掉了印度的聖雄甘地。吾現在所要介紹的，是一個和他同時同國而又與他具有同樣的精神的一個女偉人這人是誰？就是耐度夫人。</p>
<p>耐度夫人雖身爲印度這樣一個被壓迫的而又是輕視婦女的一個國家中的女子，可是她的精神和事蹟將與印度的歷史同其存在，與甘地相較，實在也無愧色。她和甘地一樣，很早就不以階級觀念的思想爲是。她是生長於高貴的婆羅門敎的，可是她在自已的婚姻上，就以身作則，破除了階級的束縳。</p>
<p>她是一個大文豪而同時又是一個大政治家，她在一九二四年時卽爲英國皇家文學社社員之一，而在全印度的婦女中祇有她一個人曾擔任過印度國民會議的主席。一九三二年在倫敦舉行的印度圓桌會議她也和甘地一起出席。牢獄的監禁不能破壞她堅决的精神。她嘗說：吾的生命一日存在，吾的血一日在這手上流着，則吾將一日不放棄爲自由的鬭爭。起來呀，將畢！起來呀，吾的兵士！吾雖不過是一個女子，一個詩人。然而在婦女這方面，吾給與你們信仰和贍力的武器，以及堅强不屈的精神，在詩人這方面，吾呼出歌唱的旗幟，上戰塲的號聲，吾將怎樣的喚起你們男子，使大家脫離奴隸的覊縛！？」</p>
<p>她的容貌生得很短小精悍，兩眼尤特有神她的氣概好像是使感情燃燒，可是她待人接物很是和平，她把内心的苦難完全發之於詩歌，她有一個聰明的頭腦，如電光一樣閃爍的頭腦。她常在從事於美的探求，她常把世上的一切轉變爲黃金的文字和黃金的事蹟。她的一生就差不多都消毁於對於各種事物的好奇心。她能深憂；也能狂悅。她的笑更是神秘的，是她獨具的一種天賦。她的笑或許可說是一種假面具。可是就是這種笑使她的頭腦在内心不能忍受的時候把事物仍能看得清楚，所以她在念自已狂歌的時候能够大笑，在自已熱誠奮發的時候能够大笑。她有一次曾在一封信裏面這樣寫過，「在天給與吾的各項才能中，吾最以爲可貴的就是笑。」實在的，處在她這樣的一個環境中祇有笑纔能戰勝一切，容忍一切。</p>
<p>她今年已有五十五歲，已是四個很長成的兒女的母親，她的身軀雖日漸衰老，可是她的爲民族自由而爭鬭的精神從不因之而稍懈。她眞不愧爲被壓迫民族中的一個女偉人呀！</p>

<p>— 丹侖</p>
<p>丨關於Ｈ市Ｃ女士的離婚事件丨</p>
<p>Ｃ女士是Ｈ市的一位很孚人望的敎師，在不久以前，她和一位認識了多年的異性朋友，結了婚，可是婚後數月，她發現了兩人間並無眞正的愛情；而男的方面，又另有著婚姻上的糾紛，於情，於理，都無强行繼續同居的必要，她便直截痛快地對男的提出了離婚。男的雖然極要面子，但也知道無可勉强，他們的離婚，便無條件的辦妥了。</p>
<p>這本來是一件極平凡，極正常，極光明，的事，該不會引起什麽非難。無如，這社會，是男性中心的社會，女子的有形被離異，無形被丢棄，不妨層見疊出，而由女子主動的離異，却似乎天地倒置，千不該萬不該的。因爲這社會，是因循苟且的社會，即使夫婦間是同床異夢，冰炭不相容，或已成了不共戴天的仇人，但旣已成了夫婦，便當顧着面子，顧着名譽）雖然作者不知道這面子是什麽面子，這名譽又是什麽名譽）表面上勉勉强强的維持着家庭的形式，一直到偕老白頭。同時這社會，又是蔑視女性的社會，以爲女子個人，秉賦着「嫁雞隨雞嫁狗隨狗」的千百年的遺傳丨也就是一般人所認爲女子的美德，决没有獨立特行的本領，也决不有自我覺悟的許可。</p>
<p>所以、像Ｃ女士那樣一件自我覺悟的離婚事件一發生、當然會引起了許多非難·因爲她是從事於敎育的·所以竟有人痛心疾首的斥之爲「敎育破産」·敎育破産之與離婚·明明是風馬牛不相及，但他們偏偏要把牠們聯系起來，作者不敏，竟找不出兩者的關係來！</p>
<p>固然，敎育破産，是一個社會問題；同時男女離婚，也是一個社會問題，但這只是兩個個别的社會問題，而無因果關係可言，若說因爲Ｃ女士是從事敎育的，從事於敎育的人與人離婚，便是敎育破産，這眞是滑天下之大稽的邏輯！</p>
<p>對於婚姻，我們原不提倡朝秦暮楚的急遽離合，但我們也絶不擁護貌合神離的傀儡配偶·在封建式的中國家庭裏，有着多多少少的活寡婦，有着多多少少被蹂躪被棄置被欺騙的女性呵，我希望她們一個個像Ｃ女士一樣地抬起頭來與對方清算一下！無論她們是做工的，居家的，從事於敎育的，……的。</p>
<p>假使一個從事於敎育的女子，由自我覺悟而主動的離了婚算是「敎育破産」的話，那末，我們不妨希望家居的，做工的，或其他的女子，來一個家庭破産，工業破産，或丨丨破産。</p>
<h3 id="c223">夏季家庭小常識—乳兒下痢 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 獨步</p>
<p>週歲左右的乳兒最易發生腸炎</p>
<p>在幼兒下痢病中最普遍的，是週歲左右乳兒所患的腸炎症。至於人工哺乳的嬰兒，雖在四五足月，就容易引起腸炎，尤其是平素哺乳不按時間，亂投雜食的結果，發生慢性榮養障礙，此種發育不良的乳嬰，更須特别注意其下痢情狀。</p>
<p>腸炎的症狀</p>
<p>乳兒發生腸炎，最初僅大便增加次數而已，没有像疫痢赤痢那樣引起急劇的症狀，進行較緩，因之常被忽視。如能在發病之初，急切施以適當的調理，亦能很快的痊愈。若不加注意，等閑視之，則數日之後，卽開始發熱，時起嘔吐，下痢增烈，口腔乾燥，呼吸深長，終成中毒而陷於不治之症。此時體重驟减，意識茫然，痙攣頻仍，生命危殆，死亡可能性，幾佔三分之二以上。</p>
<p>嬰兒的消化機能，在暑熱中，已比平日微弱，若一旦發生下痢，在有營養障礙的嬰兒，當初發之時，其消化力已經從三分一减至二分之一，此時如果仍給與通常分量的食物，則病狀必見惡化，終至發熱而陷入於中毒症狀。</p>
<p>與其給與藥物母寗注意飲食物</p>
<p>因此在乳兒患下痢時，必須停止飲食物之給與，至少减少平日的三分之二，迅速求醫診治，以保持牠可愛的小生命。經醫生考察乳兒胃腸力之强弱，定適宜的食物和分量，隨時注意其症狀，可保無虞。那時的食物，有時實較藥物的功效，更勝一籌。但是决不可以毫無醫學修養的人，所能隨便處理的。</p>
<p>預防的效果不能絶對保證</p>
<p>疫痢赤痢之類，通常用預防注射，或服内服「伐克清」，但無論實行注射或内服藥物，决不能因此便不注意平日之養生而疏忽，每日仍須謹愼日常生活，以衛生的習慣來撫育乳嬰，因爲任何其他預防方法，决没有百分之百的效果。</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是家庭的叛徒，出走已經六年。但是現在非常動摇，日夜徬徨，特地來求你的援助。</p>
<p>我入地獄（恕我！我從來不願提起那個痛惡的名詞），是在民國的第八年，方式是那時的所謂「半新半舊」。卽是家長已經講定，再由母親拿一張相片給我看。當晚空氣弄得很神秘而嚴肅，窗户關得緊緊的，母親喉嚨裏有些抖顫，决没有一絲笑容。我記得分明我没有看見一點甚麽，我没有點頭，但是也没有摇頭。天！我那時爲甚麽連摇頭的知覺都失了呢？就爲得我没有摇頭，使我活活的人生，就在短短的十六歲上，「砰！」的一刀切斷了。</p>
<p>以後，以後的生活，眞不願意提起。我的一言一動，處處得咎。他們成日架談誰家女兒的穢行，誰家事業的坍台，時時幸災樂禍地高笑，我不笑也不是，笑了偶然夾一滴眼涙也不是。我不能看書報小說，不能回娘家或訪同學姊妹，更不能和她們通信，因爲女學生多不是好東西（他們常說的話）。我不能背誦一首寄恨的詩歌，不能低唱幾聲解愁的音樂。我完完全全做個活死人。我生了兩個小孩，一個也不容許我參點意見來敎育。孩子們不是挨一頓無理由的亂打，便是被帶到戲院，賭博塲，或燕子窩去。我整天傷心兩個小孩比傷心我自已更深十倍。</p>
<p>革命軍平定了江南，我的胆子被解放的聲浪不知怎的壯了起來，某夜房裏酒氣薰天的當兒，我帶了兩個孩子離了家門。不料我謀生的路還没有找定，已被惡狠狠地追了轉去。這回，我不止是受到精神上的處罰。</p>
<p>我爲小孩忍受了肉體的精神的苦痛多時，到無可再忍的時候，我悄悄地走了。我一天天回顧家鄕的黑雲，像有魔鬼追逐似的，便一天天走得更遠。現在，離鄕已在三千里外了。現在我在敎一羣鄕村兒童，他們本來没有讀書的機會，但因我僅向村中要求一日兩頓的粗飯，所以維持了三年。我當羣童是我的小孩，給他們我所有的熱心。羣童也當我是他們的第二母親，給我格外的尊敬和親密。</p>
<p>我憑着勇氣想以他鄕爲家，以失學的兒童爲子，終身這樣做去。但是最近刦起了動摇，動摇得厲害。因爲現在大家提倡賢母良妻的思潮，我不知道這樣做和回家去做賢母良妻，那樣來得正大？我没有做賢母良妻，是不是還有「人」的價值？人生在世，我想當然揀意義最大的事做去，倘然賢母良妻是婦女唯一的最高的道德，那我只有忍痛抛開這一批可愛可憐的窮苦童兒，而回到那於我毫無用處的家庭去了。然而那將是多麽慘痛的事啊！所以我在此日夜徬徨，徬徨。鄕間又找不着明白的談論，還望你指敎我罷！</p>
<p>李巾英上七月三十日</p>
<p>巾英女士：</p>
<p>你的過去的行爲，我們十二分的同情的，你的熱忱，我們廿四分的贊嘆的。你是個反抗舊禮敎與惡勢的戰士，你已做了賢母，且是多數兒童的賢母，這意義比在家做活死人，來得正大多了，你何必再回家去呢？誰都知道，地球上有兩性的存在，女子有做妻做母的資格，但新女性丨丨尤其已是出走了的你，當然用不着再回家去，不，再回到你認爲毫無用處的家裏去。人生最大的義意，還是在於能獨立：經濟獨立，人格獨立！在這論斷下你可不必徬徨了，勇敢的你，千萬不要再被那種迷人的烟幕蒙了你的眼，再被帶去做俘虜，不知尊意以爲如何？　　記者</p>

<h3 id="c225">日本侵華之新發展及其趨勢 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 少向</p>
<p>自「塘沽恊定」而後，人們卽以爲日本對我之掠奪行爲業已告了一個段落。那知在表面上日本帝國主義進攻華北的砲聲雖已止息，但在實際上不僅戰區日軍未行撤退，長域各口延不交還，而且，從華北，蒙古一直對華南，福建都受到了日本之經濟的，政治的，軍事的勢力之新的威脅。就目前形勢看來，不僅日貨傾銷的數量將要日益增加，不僅爲日方所收買的漢奸的活動將要更加厲書，而且日軍還有再向中國進攻，掠奪中國土地的可能。</p>
<p>我們知道，「九一八」事件以後，因爲國人努力於抵制日貨運動，一時之間，幾使日本的對華貿易完全停頓，在經濟上受到了非常嚴重的打擊；但是，不久以後，我們的抵貨運動因種種關係消沈了，日本對華貿易不僅逐漸地恢復了固有情况、而且還有新的發展。據商界消息：「據日商務處最近發表，本年上半期，日本對華貿易，確有改善趨勢，輸出入貿易總額，計共一萬萬一千一百二十五萬二千日金，較諸去年同期，增加二千五百五十九萬一千日金，日貨對華輸出，計共五千一百五十四萬二千日金，較去年同期增加二百七十六萬二千日金，如將東北香港加算，則貿易總額達三萬萬日金，在各國對華貿易上，已佔絶對優越地位。實行新關稅後，對日貨輸入，已予以便利，本年下半期對華輸出，當有顯著之增加，南北各地抵制日貨運動，業於本年上半期中消滅殆盡，已不成問題。」某報二十九日電）丨丨這便是日本對華經濟侵略之新的記載和預測。</p>
<p>同時，台灣總督爲樹立其所謂「華南政策」，更特别於最近召開「對岸五領會議」。在這會議中，除一部份與日本侵華的關係最大的議案，因日方嚴守秘密，無從知道外，尚有這幾項值得注意的决議丨</p>
<p>一，宣傳以「中日親善」爲綱領之主義；</p>
<p>一，在華南傾銷煤炭；</p>
<p>一，在中國開闢台灣鳳梨罐頭市塲；</p>
<p>一，指導並奬勵籍民殖産事業。</p>
<p>這表示什麽？我們的回答是：日本帝國主義不僅要想併吞華北，而且還垂涎華南，企圖在「宣傳以「中日親善」爲綱領之主義」的下面，奴化整個中國民族丨</p>
<p>至於華北和蒙古，則更是日本帝國主義所認爲的「勢力範圍」，一切都可由其自由處理，外人不得過問。最近日方申明凡列强在華北的軍事演習都必須預先照會日本，這便是其已認華北爲已物之例證。至於其在蒙古之軍事與政治的活動，在華北的公開收買漢奸，自由招募軍隊，成立政治團體，則更是其併吞華北的野心之露骨的表現。近日以來，各方甚傳日本將於數月之内，起兵進圖綏察：這雖不一定可信，但兇横險惡的日本帝國主義之急欲併吞華北，却是誰都知道的，所成爲問題者，卽是什麽時候和在什麽情形下開始行動：如果時機一到，日軍是可以在任何藉口之下開始向我們進攻的。不久以前的藏本事件，不是日本想要以其外交官在華失踪的口實來要挾我們的一幕醜劇嗎？由此可見，只要時機一到，日本帝國主義是什麽都可以幹的。但是，就目前情形看來，日本再向中國開火的事，的確隨時都有發生的可能！</p>
<p>然而，中國刦不是簡單的日本一國的市塲，而是在國際帝國主義、特别是英日美共同宰割下的半殖民地。日本向中國不斷進攻之結果，必將直接傷害到列强，尤其是英美的利益，以引起牠門間的嚴重衝突，甚至發生戰爭。東京的軍閥和政客也看到了這點，但爲要挽救其國内之經濟政治的危機，爲要在將來的戰爭中獲得優越地位，是不得不利用目前的歐美列强的衝突形勢，拚命向中國作種種進攻，以很快的速度來點燃太平洋上的火綫的。所以，最後說來，日本拚命侵華之惟一歸宿，卽是走向戰爭，殘酷的戰爭丨</p>
<p>在此情形下，中國自然有作日本與英美等帝國主義的犧牲品的可能，是非常危險的：但同時也是我們利用帝國主義列强的衝突，在其本身的一切危機會合的時候，謀獨立找出路的絶好機會。所以，我們無須畏懼日本與一切帝國主義之進攻，應該乘機起來謀自已的解放。所可怕者，是我們閉着眼睛不看目前的形勢，老是睡着不動，任敵人來宰害，來滅亡丨</p>

<p>— 達生</p>
<p>在現社會制度下，一班中小學校的畢業生，舊式墊師的高徒，和在某境况下曾受過少許敎育的人們，因爲他們知識能力的薄弱，大半是很難在現社會中獲得重要地位的。他們的「一知半解」甚至「不知不解」的學力决定了他們可悲的前途。他們不能避免的要成爲時代的犧牲者；他們在職業界，很難有優美的收獲，卽有所獲，也很難勝任愉快的服務。他們早先没有裝多少「貨色」進肚皮，處在這生存競爭劇烈化深刻化的今日，自然是鮮有不失敗得一塌糊塗的。（肚内裝有貨色的人現在也同其命運了。）</p>
<p>可是他們總還能寫得來一筆字。他們多半還有忍苦耐勞的本領。就仗這點本領他們也未嘗不可以拿來去換取麵包。一個抄寫員的位置並非完全缺少，完全找不着的。</p>
<p>在這篇短文裏我就想叙述一點這一類以抄寫爲主要職務，而在名義上也許是呌作「書記」或「助手」</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>或「私人秘書」的人們的生活。首先我要說到的是這班人們工作的辛苦和付與這辛苦的報酬的比例的不相稱這一點。我們先不妨觀察各級學校中書記先生們生活辛苦的情狀。他們比較重要的工作大半是抄寫油印講義，佈告，通知書，公文，信札，以及學校中的其他文件。在大學裏書記先生們在職務上有較精密的分工，校長室的書記先生是不管敎務處註册處的事的，寫油印的也只是侷促在自已的小室裏和臘紙鋼板爲伴侣。中學的情形比較不同，一位書記先生常是以一個敎務處職員的資格，同時還兼作着訓育上的事務上的文墨事情，有時還得於百忙中接受校長室送來的委託和吩咐。小學的書記先生則更其是萬能的，舉凡全校一切抄寫油印上的事情，幾乎很少有可以不借重他的妙手的。</p>
<p>上面的三種書記先生中，無疑的是以在小學服務的最爲　　而又得到最低的報酬。在江浙敎育比較發達的各縣公立小學中，一位書記先生若能每天以八小時的血汗去換得十五元一月的薪金，一定要算是一件不錯的事。作者去年在浦東南匯參觀過兩所學生有六七百人之多的大規模的縣立完全小學、每校就是以月薪十五元各僱用了一位書記先生的。其他各省在敎育經費竭蹶的形勢之下，小學書記先生怕很少有能拿到這個數目的吧。本市的情形也差不多。作者從前在本市服務過的某中學附屬小學也是拿這個數目的月薪付與牠的書記先生的。上面所說的是較有規模的高初兩級小學。那些學生少設備簡陋的小學自然根本出不起這個數目，多數甚至根本上就用不起這樣一個職員。而初級小學呢，在校長兼任聽差的情形下，說能僱用書記自然是近乎一種神話了。至於多數私立小學爲了收入不景氣，他們的算盤子也决不會撥到這種近　浪費的額外支出的。</p>
<p>中學的書記先生，在較有規模的學校裏，每月獲得二十元的報酬，可稱很是平常。假設你在該校「服務有年，成績卓著」的話，你的月薪不難因學校的發展而加到二十五元，三十元之數。若你想再往上升，則你的希望可就會成了一個不易實現的幻想了。</p>
<p>現在再說到大學裏書記先生的待遇。一位在校長室服務的書記先生（常兼任文牘）每月可支領四十元到六十元的薪水。各校情形雖不盡同，但相差有限。寫油印講義的書記先生每月最高收入很難超過三十元，而且大都在二十五元上下。在校長室服務的多半是校當局的親信，或是本校的學生，而寫油印的則多半是以抄寫技術見長而被僱用的，這中問因有資格能力地位的不同，報酬自不能相等。</p>
<p>現在我想說一說他們的苦處。抄寫本來是一種極其機械枯燥的工作，任傳人怕都不甚歡迎。但抄寫工作中最機械最令人不耐的，恐怕要　寫油印這件事了。無論怎樣一個這方面的專門人才，很少有不對着那臘紙鋼板和鋼筆發愁的。他們也許寫得很好，但字顯現在臘紙上的總不够美麗；一些由臘紙質料不佳及鋼筆鋼板本身上生出的毛病，當更增加了他們的不耐和厭煩。你隨便抓住一個這種油印專家問問，你立刻會發現他談起没有不摇頭歎息的。尤其是在大小考的時候，則更是到了要他們的命的緊急關頭。亭位先生的考題也送來印，那位先生的考題也送來印，先生們又都是忙人，不早預備，每有明天要考今天才送考題來的。各位先生的考題都集中在一起，時間又是那樣的迫促，他們於千忙萬忙之中，很少有不特别犧牲，整夜「開夜車」，以求在職務上無差池與隕越，而度過這難關的。每學期總有這麽幾天不能好睡的緊張的日子給他們挨度。有些學校，特别是小學校，不但要自已「寫」，就是「印」也要自已動手，這苦處當然又是更進一層的了。僱用書記的當然不光是學校，社會上工商軍政各機關總也有些文件要人抄錄，也都免不掉的需要這種人才。他們在這各方面的待遇不能盡同，但有一點相同而爲我們所深切知道的，就是他們的地位低微，一切都須受上級職員的指揮，談不到自已的自由意志，自已僅是一具被使用的傀儡的這件事。他們的收入從這地位上去觀察也就很不難推知的了。</p>
<p>我們也不必替這班人的不幸憂愁，他們到底還算是一個有正當職業可以自活的人。世界上有一種有更高的資格與能力而也在靠着這抄寫職務混飯吃的人，我認爲他們是更不幸的一羣人。我們知道，現在失業的大學生，中小學敎師，及文化方面的人不知有多少，他們只要有可以自活的方法，不論要出怎樣的血汗代價，也許都樂於接受某種艱難職務的。學者，名流，專家們常要僱用一個「助手」或「私人秘書」之類，主要的目的是要找一個人抄抄文稿，帮同搜集材料並剪貼分類整理各項材料等，這就爲上面所說的那班人供獻一條出路了。他們自然不能根據他們的資格拿薪水，就他們的機械的工作說也不會有大薪水到手。學者名流專家們的僱用「助手」也不一定是長期的，某項工作作完了，他會請你去「休息」一會，待新工作到時他會再來「通知」你。他們致酬的方法也不一定按月計算，也有用「件工制」的。按月計算，則他們每月大致可付三十元到四十元之數，按件計算，則每千字不會少過二角大洋。過去有一個在外埠服務的同學中途失業回來，找到了他的主住敎授，那位先生就給了他的學生一點抄寫的工作，每月送給他三十塊錢。那同學幹了兩個月，又另尋他的生路去了。又有一位敎授先生在學生中僱用了一位助手，指定了一些抄寫文稿，剪報，到文化機關去抄寫有關材料的事給他作，按月付他四十元的酬勞。至於按字計算，則在八小時中最快的怕也抄不到一萬字，就是七八千字也要用不少氣力；終日埋頭伏案的結果，也不過得一塊多錢。還有，這種抄寫員常要被派到各著名社會機關中去的，如大報館，大圖畫館，大工廠，大銀行…去抄錄一些現成的統計的和有研究性的材料。在冬天，手凍僵了你不能拿這作爲一種理由說你想休息一兩天；在這夏天，你也不能因爲汗水流得太多，而有所推托，致誤了東家的研究大事。爲了生活，你得忍耐一切。你作了你職務上的奴隸，自然是情有可原；但你若忽略了致此的原因，我却認爲是不可恕的。</p>

<h3 id="c227">鹿行 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>大家對于鹿大概是知道的吧！不是時常可在書本上讀到關于鹿的故事嗎？這是一種美麗而極馴善的動物，一身長着光澤的褐黃色的細毛，中間雜着許多白斑點，那褐黃色的身上四散着一圈圈的純白色的小圓點，眞是美觀極了！所以亦有稱爲「花鹿」，「梅花鹿」的名字。鹿的頭上還生着一對修長的歧出的角，像舊戲中在紗帽上加揷着二枝花的狀元。就把牠比擬做狀元，亦不會錯到怎樣，如牠那件美觀的外衣，不是同那時候的狀元及第榮歸時具有一樣的氣慨嗎？牠的出産處是我們已失去的台灣内地山裏，由那地方的人設陷穽把牠捉來，不過大多數是專門飼養在家裏，而將牠們運售到我們中國來的。這種鹿我們關東地方亦有出産的，只是數量不多罷了。且關東的鹿比台灣的佳，却爲成本較昻，而不能合用。那末這些鹿作什麽用呢？都是作藥料的，國藥舖裏的「全鹿丸」，「鹿角膠」等，便是鹿製的。還有「鹿茸」就是鹿初生的角，更是貴重的物品</p>
<p>早年台灣的鹿都是由帆船裝來，到浙江的鎭海口岸卸下，就在該地交行家代銷出去。每年二三月的時候，就有新鹿運來，可是大半是尚幼小，一定還要再飼養幾月才可售去。每次運來的數目並不多，十數隻，二三十隻，不一定的。全年統計，亦只有一百多隻。一待運到交清了，此後的責任，就在代理行家的身上了。當然，行裏一定要另闢一處專門供養牠們的地方，那一長排的木欄，把一隻隻的鹿拴在那裏。青草是唯一的食料，這是另雇人到四野割來的。一天得餧牠們四五次，餧的時候要二三個人分頭施給，否則這邊見那邊有草，便想搶過去，於是整個欄裏，便要騷亂不安了。冬天的時候，青草都枯萎了，這時候大都是用小麥和蕃薯薯藤代替的。這些鹿亦要生病，只要見牠呆呆的不吃什麽，便應設法醫治；不幸不治死了，就該立刻寫信通知彼方，並須留下鹿的全皮及四足，作爲物證，亦是以之表明本人心跡的。</p>
<p>對于鹿的售法是論斤計值的，不過亦要看市上銷路如何，所運到的多少。市上銷路好，而運到的又少，自然可賣好價錢：反之便少人顧問了。所以每斤一二元，也許還要少些，都說不定哩。一隻鹿少的也有天平秤七八十斤，那末總可以賣到七八十元，同災區裏的難民以一二十元的代價出售他們的兒女而尚没人要的比起來，可說是人不如獸了丨因爲是一斤有一斤的值價，雙方成議交貨時，那些行中的夥計，便在暗中不管死活的把草硬塞給鹿吃下，更有把石子雜在木籠的草中，冀增加重量的。其實能加重多少呢？眞是一件卑鄙而可笑的事啊！各買客是要幾隻買幾隻，並没有操縱和壟斷的事，此點或是可嘉的。那時銷量大的，當推杭州的胡慶餘堂了，一年可以銷數十隻；其次是杭州的葉衆德堂：餘皆不能望其項背，如小巫之見大巫了。</p>
<p>每批鹿運來和售去，那忙碌的情形，使一向平靜的空氣，驟然熱閙一下。一隻隻裝着鹿的木籠，平也在廣塲上，許多人好奇的圍攏來，並有故意挑撥牠玩笑的。據說鹿要殺時，還要祭神，將牠掛采，抬着遊行。前者誠然是迷信得可笑的舉動，後者却是一種廣告，使大家知道某藥舖的出品，並不以僞物欺人的。</p>
<p>近四五年來，因洋面上海盜横行，整隻帆船都常被綁去，如改由輪船運來，又以費用太大，而致無利可圖，且爲抵貨運動的關係，（台灣早非我國所有的了丨自然在同一之例的·）所以台灣的鹿已不再運來，竟可說是絶跡了。不過主要原因還是在於浙江蘭谿和慈谿地方，已設有小規模的養鹿塲專門飼養。然鹿的銷路已不如以前，亦是可諱言的。因爲鹿是作補品的，你想，現在有許多人連飲都没得吃，還會想到補品上去嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c228">世界不景氣聲中的我國麥業 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵兵</p>
<p>小麥不但在我國的北方爲主要食品，卽在歐美諸國，亦爲不可或缺的糧食，所以在談論生活的時節，中國人往往說到「飯碗」，而外國人則都說是「麵包」。由此可見小麥與麵粉，實在是民食問題中一個非常值得注意的問題。</p>
<p>一般人常常因爲北方人食麵，南方人吃米，便以爲只有北方産麥，這實是一個錯誤的觀念。北數省固然産麥甚豐，然而長江以南却也有許多地方産麥的。江蘇，湖北，安徽諸省，每年都有三千萬擔以上的産量，比較重要産地的河南，山東，也少不了很多。現在且把近三年來我國小麥的總生産量列表如下：</p>
<p>民國二十年　三八九百萬擔</p>
<p>民國二十一年　四○一</p>
<p>民國二十二年　二二九○</p>
<p>這個數目，從表面看起來，好像頗有可觀：可是實際上·並不如此。我們試把最近三年來外麥推口數量與上列數目對比一下，便可看出我國麥産問題的嚴重性。</p>
<p>民國二十年　二二百萬擔</p>
<p>民國二十一年　一五</p>
<p>民國二十二年　一七</p>
<p>就是說，我國的麥産雖然相當地豐富，然而每年却仍舊要輸入二千萬擔（約值一萬萬元）的洋麥。這是多麽慘痛的事實啊！</p>
<p>有些國内的經濟專家，因爲看到我國每年有二千萬擔洋麥的輸入，便皮面地解釋爲「中國麥産不能自足自給」，這完全是無稽之談。他們只看到進口數量之驚人，却忘記子這驚人的數量，完全是因爲内地交通不便等等，以致於各商埠的廠商，不得不採購洋麥的縁故。</p>
<p>目前中國種麥的農尸，一方面遭遇到高利貸和苛捐雜稅的壓迫，一方面又遭遇到麥價跌落的打擊。關於高利貸和苛捐雜稅的情形，姑置勿論，現在我們且來看看麥價的實况。</p>
<p>在二十年前，國産小麥平均每擔約值五元。十年前，平均約值六元，可是到了最近，能够渡過四元的市價已不多見，加以洋麥價格的逐步跌落，國麥乃大有不可挽救之勢。</p>
<p>國麥雖然如此趨跌，然而因爲牠的質地稍差，所以麵粉業依舊採購洋麥。這樣採購洋麥的結果，一方面固然是促成了大量的入超，一方面却又阻滯了國麥的銷路，降低了國麥的價格。洋麥循環不已地湧進，國麥循環不已的下降，結果不但造成了國麥的危機，連帶地也造成了國産麵粉業的危機。我們只要看一看最近國産麵粉銷路的銳减及其價格的狂跌，便可瞭然。</p>
<p>今年一月至三月在上海所銷售的麵粉，只抵得去年同期間的百分之七十。粉價也只抵得去年同期的百分之八十五。産量更跌到去年同期的百分之四十六。長此下去，不但是農民因爲無處求售，無以爲活：就連經營麵粉的廠商，恐怕也難以爲活吧！</p>
<p>要想挽救這可怕的災難，我們認爲，不但是要增加洋麥進口稅，同時對於國麥品質的改良，苛捐雜稅的廢除，高利貸的取締、内地交通的開發，種植麥田的奬勵，採用國麥的　奬等等，都非要予以最大的努力不可。</p>

<h3 id="c229">無線電之研究 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 青</p>
<p>研究無綫電爲我業餘工作之一，近年來大部業餘時間均致力於比。雖此項工作自民國二十一年始有之，然在此短短二三年間，對於無綫電自信已有相當之認識。在研究時，失敗與成功循環而來；初試失敗，再試又失敗，但我能以不屈不撓之精神赴之，最後成功終屬於我。愈失敗而愈努力研究，愈研究而愈享受。數年來朝斯夕斯，樂乃無藝，故願他人亦從事於此焉。兹謹就鄙見所及，述研究無綫電之利益與其初步方法如下，想爲有志自行研究者所樂聞歟？</p>
<p>無綫電乃新進事業之一；在我國亦尚稱發達，雖不能與歐美並駕齊驅，但尚能追隨其後；尤以近年來確有長足之進步。社會需要無綫電專門人才極爲殷切；舉凡船舶電台，航空電台，氣象電台，軍用電台，商用電台，廣播電台及其他關於無綫電之製造修理管理，在大需要此項人才。故有無綫電技能者，不難在今日粥少僧多之社會上，獲得一枝之棲。若本人尚有經營事業之魄力者，更可利用此新事業在中國尚未充分發達之時機，創立一種新事業。則於國家可助長此新事業之發展，在個人可圖温飽，實一舉兩得之事。卽不欲以無綫電爲一種固定職業，而但利用一部份業餘時間以研究之，以爲一種業餘工作，則所費精神時間亦極值得。當我以一人之力裝成第一架收音機而聽筒中聽得音樂聲時，其樂眞南面王不及也。而况無數經騐學識可於此中獲得乎。</p>
<p>對無綫電爲門外漢者，往往以爲無綫電機爲一件奇妙莫測斧鬼工之事，實際上不學無術者流亦可研究而享受之。嘗見某無綫電商店之技師，其初不過爲該商店之學徒，不知無綫電爲何物，而今則居然滔滔不絶敎人製作矣。最初着手研究時，宜多閱書籍雜誌，同時配購若干另件，置辦相當工具，卽可入手試作。初宜製作最簡單之礦石收音機，繼則一隻眞空管者，然後逐漸加多眞空管隻數；由用乾電者而爲用電燈電者，由長波者而爲短波者，由收音機而爲發射機。總之，由簡而繁，由易而難，則學識經騐自然循序而進；切不可好高騖遠，致遇困難來時，束手無策矣。至最淺近最實用之無綫電書籍，據我所知者，有中華書局出版之「無綫電入門」六册，申報館出版之「無綫電讀本」，上海江西路三二三號亞美公司出售之「科學叢書」六册；皆淺顯實用，卽不知無綫電爲何物者閱讀後，亦能依之自行製造。俟經騐學識增加後，然後再逐漸自求深造。深造之道無他，但多試騐與多閱書耳。</p>
<p>無綫電爲我國新興事業之一，其進步與希望實無止境，殊值得我人從事其中。願有志此道者，急起直追，勿爲「無此學識」而氣沮，則本文之作不朽矣。</p>

<h3 id="c230">車水 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 曼農</p>
<p>常州通訊</p>
<p>今年黃梅季節没有落「梅雨」，農人們只能車水蒔秧。費五六個人工車滿二三畝田的水，秧剛蒔完，水也就乾了。「黃秧」不經乾，於是跟着再車水「　　」。太陽毒，田週園燥土的吸太量大，添了漫挨不到三天，水又乾了，秧還没活，不能不再添。河淺車陡，戽水困難，有花費十八個人工，車一天水，還不够二畝田秧添一個漫的。因此今年江南的稻田，能蒔下秧的，不到半數：而比往年多三四倍的人工，都費在車水添漫上去了。後來，河塘溝壩相繼斷涸，弄得無水可車没有斷涸的也因車不　車而停車了。他們就把精力，希望與僅有的金錢，盡放在出會祈雨上面去。在有的怪人家不誠，有的怨菩薩不靈的旱災程度加深中，千萬數的農民都捧着同一的心兒，對着「白田」的焦土，與乾枯得像摩登女郎的頭髮那般散蓬着的秧科，失望，焦急與憂悉。没有伊呀桔橰的車聲，没有呼籌叱牛的人聲，整個農村在飢餓死亡的災難氣氛下躺着。</p>
<p>近來落了幾天並不怎麽多的雨，晨民抱着「落動落動」，落動了會繼續再落雨的信心，趁秧科活發，不能再乾時機，儘可能地把可以車到的水，當了蚊帳，不惜工本地從遥遠輾轉往田裏車，於是水車又活動起來了。</p>
<p>車的名稱因着應用法可以分爲幾類。用手摇的呌小車，其中一種由一人兩隻手捉住摇棍像打拳樣地摇動的呌打拳車：車身較闊大，須要兩人一起一伏地車的呌龍車。大車是脚踏的，依須要踏的人數多少來定名，像三人車，金鋼車，六人車，九老頭等。所謂金鋼車就是四人車，鄕下人忌諱「四」與「死」同音，所以用四大金鋼這名兒來代替了。九個人踏的九老頭，要稱車中之王了，不是今年這樣大旱的高車垜上，平常是很少用到牠的。此外還有用牛推的牛車，那是有像大菌子樣的茅棚蓋在車垜上的固定水車。至於機器打水車，因爲價錢太貴，條件又多，在應用上還不甚普遍。</p>
<p>小車在今年幾乎完全失了效用。長長的河堤岸上，柳蔭空處。你可以看見六個，九個人踏的大水車，像「連營寨」樣的排列着。在汗流脚腫的掙扎中，呼籌聲與車輪聲悽慘地成爲絶唱，駭得柳枝上的蟬兒不敢也不忍唱牠「知了，知了」的高調似的。眞的，軸上的工作是太艱難困苦了。</p>
<p>東方剛發白，在倦了的星光下，車水班上工了。依六人車的工作分配是：由最年壯力强的兩入扛抬沉重的軸。眼健心細的</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>兩人抬長槽，除了滿槽的「練篦」丨括水的葉子外，還得帶鋤頭，鐵鏟與茶壺等。餘下兩個人是負擔踏凳，撑木，水梯，草簾等用具的運輸。水車是一部頗複雜的機器，可是由有訓練的車水班裝置起來倒頗科學化，這樣分運到目的地的車垜上，各人連忙分工裝置起來。鏟軸的兩人是安軸，墊踏凳，打撑子，用抬長槽的繩索與扶槓丨一根直長的杉木丨縛在撑木上給大家伏在上面踏車。抬槽的人放好槽，把「龍頭練蓖」盤接在軸的撥齒上，下水墊水梯。其餘的兩人是用鋤鏟開龍門丨築缺口，在踏凳與軸的旋轉處加滑油，把草簾張在撑木頭上遮蔭。裝置完了上車，抬軸的兩人踏軸的兩端靠撑木的兩副「踏脚一，呌左右「頭步」。抬稱的分佔軸中央的撥齒與槽頭練篦盤接處的水門左右，呌「把龍門」。其餘的兩人車頭步與龍門中間的空位，呌左右「絞絲步」。十二隻脚板齊踏，當然誰都不許偷懶踏空脚的，可是車絞絲步的兩人是比較輕鬆得多了，擋頭步的在脚踏以外、還得留心打進土去的撑木是否堅固，縛着扶槓與張住草簾的繩結是否會斷或鬆解，把龍門的兩人要留心槽中水的深淺，篦葉是否有滑脫與斷練的毛病。因爲六個人體重的壓積，水震與風襲之下，車是時常會出毛病的。撑木倒呌「桃螺螄」，繩斷槓落呌「大拜年」，練斷呌「回龍」，那多是有跌死人，打壞車具之危險的岔子。若出了這樣的險，那末，他們非但得不到工錢，而且老板還要根據出險的原因，找住車頭步或龍門的人理論呢。</p>
<p>這麽熱的天氣，口眼手脚一同勞動的車水工人，其熱是不用說的了。只有車早水是唯一僅有的避熱方法。被雇定的一軸人就在前天晚上先把車裝置好，半夜三更就帶着未復元的疲倦與空肚子去上車，車了三四百籌水纔天亮回來吃早餐是常有的事。稀疎的草簾是不足遮什麽蔭的，晒脫了皮的背曝在火毒的太陽太，生滿着痱了的胸脯伏在扶槓上，腫脹的脚板一下一下地踹着踏脚，膿水從破了皮的脚疱裏滴瀝地與混身的汗水交流着，所請「手足胼胝」是不足形容他們的辛苦於萬一的！所以車呀車的陡地從扶槓上掉了下來，就斷了氣，與休息時在柳蔭下一躺就爬不起來的慘死，在今年的車垜上，是常有的事。卽没有當塲發病的健者，晚上領了工錢回去，上床睡覺時也會搬不上自已的腿，須要老婆或兒子抬一下的。可是，明天，明天有人雇去車水，還算是幸運的了。唉，勞力與生命的賤賣呵，這年頭兒！由於旱得有水可車的機會太少，以致人浮於車，所以，這麽拚命地車一天的工人才只一毛大洋呢。</p>
<p>最後，我得說車水倒是頗藝術的事，他們多用一種最原始的歌唱形式的「數籌」來冀望忘懷些許疲勞的。在槽中某一練篦上釘上一對白鵝毛做記號，呌做「龍頭」，在上車開始踏得軸轉時，大家同聲唱一句只剩聲音已經聽不出意義了的調子，接着就由左或右邊的第一人按着龍頭的週轉上下，用所謂「浪浪調」的唱一句數目，呌「數籌」，滿十轉的時候，由數籌者唱一句調子要求那一頭的一人「計籌」，於是計籌者回唱一句，全體和唱一聲，數籌者再唱一句，全體再和一聲，這名爲「回籌」。這樣按着次序由第二人數唱下去，滿十再回，再唱。雖是調子單調，句子除計數外没有别的内容意義，可是一唱衆和，來往接替，的確可以忘記些工作的苦痛的，這是藝術的起源和作用呵。因爲踏得脚下有數，他們是不必用眼睛去注意龍頭的上下就能唱着數目的。也有打着鑼鼓唱簡單的「花鼓戲調」的，那多半是湖南的客民。也有不數不唱，用綫往車上絞來計籌的。</p>
<p>照官工每天是車一千零五籌水就好停車了。可是今年這麽旱的程度，老板有要求車到千五六百籌，甚至於不計籌而整天車下去的。</p>

<p>上海市敎育局第二屆暑期講習會，自七月九日開始舉行至七月二十一日止，計共兩星期。雖然天氣這樣的炎熱，但各私立學校小學敎師報名參加者約有二百人之多。在這兩星期中，筆者所見所聞的趣事很多，現在且把會中的花花絮絮拉雜記出來，或許足供閱者業餘的解悶吧。</p>
<p>講習會學員大多數是年齡在二十歲至四十歲之間。最特色的是一位六十餘歲的老翁，鬍和頭髮也都白了，還來聽講。講師講一句，他摇頭幌腦一下，似乎是聽得津津有味。另外還有一位女郎，年約十六歲左右，稚氣未脫，跳跳躍躍的大吃其口香糖，和那一位老翁白髮紅顔相映成趣。</p>
<p>會塲設在西門黃家闕路務本女子中學内，而聽講學員却是居住虹口的佔大多數。路途是這們遠，祇可乘電車來代替步行了。乘坐電車是少不了銅元的。用報紙包裹銅元，常常紙會穿破，所以在聽講的時候，常聽見銅元落地地聲音。謔者說：這是大洒金錢呢。</p>
<p>每日下午一時半至五時半爲特别演講，由該會敦請海上名流到會演講。那天大約是十二日吧，會中敦請衛生局長李廷安先生演講「敎育與衛生」。李局長到會時，已經是一時三刻了。李局長在未演講之前，首先說明他遲到的原因。他說：「現在實行新生活運動，約會要守時刻。兄弟素來是最守時刻的，今天因爲時錶壞了，不知時候，趕着去買了新錶到來，那知已遲到十五分鐘了。」他說罷取出新錶來給大家看。各學員都哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>會中所聘請的講師，都是大學敎授和文學家。他們不是穿長袍，就是穿西裝的。祗有講授「小學組織及行政」一科的大夏大學敎育學院院長邵爽秋先生，不拘拘於小節，穿着短衣褲來上講堂。講台後已有台上風扇在背後吹着，他老先生却手持大葵扇在前面煽着。或許他老先生身體肥胖怕熱的原因，前後都要納凉吧。</p>
<p>近來天氣炎熱，兼之各學員一早便跑來聽講，在下午的時候，大多數有懨懨欲倦的樣子，如果不有警惕和有興趣的話，來提醒人們的精神。任你講師說得怎樣的津津有味，却是聽者藐藐，大做其　睡虫了。「小學複式敎學法」是世界書局編緝魏冰心先生所講授的。魏先生爲要提醒衆人的精神，所以他說着笑話道：「複式敎學法現在是不甚通行，好比老古董一樣，要迎合時流，應當敎摩登化的東西。老古董要變成摩登化，好似鷄皮鶴髮的老太婆，穿着時裝和高跟皮鞋。」各學員聽了他這幾句笑話都大笑起來，像打了嗎啡針一般，果然提起了精神。</p>
<p>其他尚有許多趣事，因爲限於篇幅，祗好不記了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) British troops stationed along the Beining Railway, as per usual practice, conduct exercises near Shanhaiguan in early August every year. On July 31st, British Major Oxford stationed in Tianjin led 200 British soldiers, carrying rifles, tents, machine guns, and other equipment, and arrived at Shanhaiguan. Fearing that the British troops would occupy the southern coastline, the Japanese side pre-emptively had a garrison and part of a lightly armed brigade stationed there. After the British troops arrived, they moved to the vicinity of Erlang Temple for exercises. At the same time, the Japanese troops also conducted street fighting and field artillery exercises outside the South Gate, and Shanhaiguan was filled with artillery fire. The British side also notified the county government and public security bureau, hoping that the people would not be alarmed by the sounds. The head of the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency in Shanhaiguan, Igi, because the British military exercises were not notified to the Japanese side, telegraphed the Japanese embassy in Beiping to negotiate with the British ambassador, Cadogan. Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakasugi once went to the British embassy, but because Ambassador Cadogan was vacationing in Beidaihe, he was received by Counselor Holman. As a result, permission was granted to reserve it. Wakasugi telegraphed Igi. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, during a machine gun target practice exercise by the Japanese troops at the four coastal forts in the South China Sea, two British soldiers transporting supplies were accidentally wounded and died shortly thereafter. Upon hearing the news, British military commander Oxford sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese garrison commander Wakakawa, but to no avail. The situation was very tense at the time. On the morning of the 3rd, two British cruisers and one flagship also arrived in the waters off Qinhuangdao. Sailors landed on Qinhuangdao and were stationed outside the Mining Bureau.

<p>(Beiping) At 4 pm on the afternoon of the 3rd, the French and Italian military commanders stationed in Yu, together with our side's Linyu County Magistrate Yuan Tai and Public Security Bureau Chief Su Yuqi, conducted mediation with the British and Japanese military authorities. The British side demanded four points: (1) Express apology to the British army; (2) Punish the soldiers who killed the British soldiers; (3) Compensate for the losses of the dead and provide pensions; (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. The mediators then went to the Japanese barracks to visit Wakakawa for negotiations. The Japanese attitude was resilient, indicating that they could not accept it. The representatives replied to the British side on the evening of the 3rd with no results, and the situation deteriorated. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese troops in various units in Nanhaijiao Mountain received orders to stop the exercises. The Japanese barracks at the four forts and the Japanese troops near the railway began to prepare for alert and prohibited pedestrians. The British troops also stopped the exercises this morning. More than 300 British troops arrived at Qinhuangdao Station on the night of the 3rd, transferred from Tianjin, making the situation more tense.

<p>(Nanjing) The temperature in Beijing has been over 100 degrees for two weeks, and there has been no rain. The rice fields have become cracked again, and a disaster is taking shape. The price of rice changes several times a day. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has an order to suppress rice prices, it is difficult to implement. The Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Bankers' Association, stating that the Grain Food, Rice Shop, and Money Rice Shop three associations are unable to purchase rice and grain due to financial stagnation. However, the rice stored in Beijing will be exhausted. If methods are not promptly found, it will inevitably cause serious problems. Please ask the banking community to consider granting loans to provide relief. After the banks transferred this letter from the association, they agreed to automatically select reliable rice merchants and grant loans as appropriate. However, the municipal government has no intention of guaranteeing responsibility, so the amount of loans is also very limited. Grain and rice are related to people's livelihood, and who in the banking community does not have a heart to help the public? However, since the January 28th Incident, more than 100,000 in loans granted to rice merchants have become bad debts. In view of the past losses, they had to be cautious. According to a rice industry, the reason for the recent soaring rice prices is not manipulation, but because the rice stored is decreasing day by day, and the source is meager. Recently, although the banking community has automatically granted loans, the amount is small and still cannot purchase large amounts of grain and rice. Now the industry intends to organize a group, and the group will come forward to borrow money from the banking group again. Please ask the government to guarantee. If there are no large amounts of funds to supply the industry's circulation, I am afraid that it will be a drop in the bucket and will not help. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Respectful Observation of the Urgent Sino-Soviet Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>At a time when negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway are intermittent, Sino-Soviet relations have once again shown a dangerous state. According to Havas News Agency, Japanese military police have arrested more than 20 Russian employees at the Suifenhe Railway Station and other stations, and are preparing to expand the scope of the arrest. It is believed that this is a planned action, not a mere coincidence. Moreover, Soviet aircraft have been constantly conducting reconnaissance on the Soviet-Manchurian border, which has also aroused protests from both the Japanese and puppet sides. As for the Japanese side's claim that the Soviet side is moving border markers, although it comes from Japanese propaganda, it cannot be fully believed. However, after this publicity, how much seriousness will be added is to be expected. The Sino-Soviet sides have been displaying their military strength and preparing for the worst. The urgency of the situation has not started today. At the end of last year, someone inspected both ends of the Chinese Eastern Railway and witnessed the heated preparation of the Sino-Soviet war, saying that a war could not be avoided this summer, as if a major war already had a motive.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the possibility of war has become more and more obvious. First, Japan is actively building railways and highways in the northeastern provinces. In addition to the completion of the Duntugou section of the Ji-He Railway, there is also a plan for the so-called seven major railway trunk lines. Among them, the Rehe Railway and the Tao-Suo Railway are the most militarily significant. The former is used to control Inner Mongolia, and the latter is used to guard the Xing'an Mountains. The rest, such as the highways that run horizontally and vertically across the entire territory, are also aimed at war in determining their construction routes. Second, the Japanese army recently convened a meeting in Chengde. Most of the participants belonged to the backbone cadres, and the person in charge was the famous aggressor Doihara. It is obvious that the Japanese are increasing their troops along the Great Wall. Grabbing Inner Mongolia is particularly determined. Considering their intention, it is nothing more than to take two approaches. On the one hand, they want to lure the Mongols into their arms. On the other hand, they take the opportunity to send troops straight to Outer Mongolia, as a prelude to the war against the Soviet Union. Third, Japan had heavy troops along the Chinese Eastern Railway. This spring, they used the name of troop rotation to move the 3rd and 16th Divisions to Harbin, Heilongjiang and other places, and attached special units, such as air squadrons and tank squadrons. Everything was available to form a wartime organization. The number of troops stationed and the details of the distribution are all strictly confidential and never leaked. From the tension of its actions, it can be seen that it is actively preparing for war. Fourth, although Japan intends to go to war, it is still afraid of air raids. Vladivostok and Japan's Keihin giant town are very close, making defense even more difficult. Therefore, it is stepping up air defense efforts. If it is not clear that war is inevitable, why bother to do this urgently.</p>
<p>Because of these various reasons, one feels that the Sino-Soviet situation is becoming more and more urgent. However, since the Soviet Union implemented the second five-year plan, it has focused on domestic construction, so it has tried its best to seek stability in all directions. This is the case with Western Europe, and the same is true with the Far East. Although it sometimes shows its edge, targeting Japan, it is only a kind of demonstration and warning, and it is by no means intentional to start a war. If the Soviet Union can maintain peace and show its construction achievements to the capitalist world, its gains will be many times greater than war. Therefore, if it is not attacked, it will not attack others. However, Japanese warlords are greedy and boastful. After the September 18th Incident, they believe that they have no opponents in the world. Fortunately, their general citizens have long suffered deeply, so the psychology of opposing war is becoming more and more intense. However, they do not dare to speak out, and only express their indignation in indirect ways. Once a war breaks out, assuming that 2 million troops are sent, the daily expenditure will be as high as 40 million yen, and the total monthly expenditure will exceed their annual regular income. Although the ambitions of the Japanese chaebols are great, they must not dare to be reckless. There are still many problems in the northeast, and there are different factions within the military. In the initial stage of the war, they may be able to cope reluctantly. But after a little longer, it will be difficult to predict the outcome. Therefore, the current tense atmosphere between the Sino-Soviet Union is not enough to prove that the two countries will soon go to war.</p>

<p>Japan Declares it Will Take Necessary Measures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to today's Nichinichi Shimbun, Russia has recently taken a series of unfriendly actions towards Japan, which will be a serious warning to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The newspaper predicts that if Russia continues its current policy, Japan will suspend all negotiations with Russia and take the necessary plan to stop its activities. In recent days, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army have discussed a strict policy against Russia. The newspaper also listed the unfriendly actions taken by Russia as follows: (1) Russian military aircraft have repeatedly violated the territory of "Manchukuo"; (2) Russian Jiangbin guards have shot at "Manchukuo" ships sailing on the Heilongjiang and Songhua Rivers; (3) Refused the compromise method proposed by Foreign Minister Hirota on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway; (4) Russian authorities refused to issue passports to fishermen representatives to go to Moscow to participate in the ruble-yen exchange rate negotiations between Russia and Japan. The newspaper also said that the implementation of this policy by the Soviet Union is the result of its recent signing of a non-aggression pact with its western neighbors and reaching an understanding with Eastern European countries.

<p>(Washington) Saturday marked the 144th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. Coastal Tax Police. Rumors have resurfaced that the force will soon be reorganized by the Navy Department. These rumors circulated widely in Washington several months ago, leading to widespread opposition from those sympathetic to the force. It is claimed that increasing national defense strength and saving expenses are the reasons for the reorganization. At the same time, the Army Department also stated today that it will request appropriations in the next Congress to increase air defense for the United States and the Panama Canal.

<p>Konoe Meets with Naval Minister Osumi</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Naval authorities anticipate that the London Naval Disarmament Preparatory Talks will involve in-depth technical negotiations. Therefore, they have selected officers with experience in disarmament issues and a thorough understanding of internal affairs. As a result of the selection process, it has been decided to dispatch Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, former commander of the First Air Fleet, currently serving in the Naval General Staff and the Navy Ministry. Rear Admiral Yamamoto is scheduled to depart from Yokohama in late August, travel via the United States, and arrive in London in late September. It is also expected that political negotiations will run concurrently with the expert meetings in the preparatory conference. Therefore, there is a proposal to dispatch a civil official representative to assist Ambassador Matsudaira, to liaise with the Navy and handle matters effectively. Recently, Naval Minister Osumi is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota to hold important discussions. (4th, Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prince Konoe, Speaker of the House of Peers, who returned to Tokyo on July 31st, met with Naval Minister Osumi at the Navy Ministry at 10:30 this morning to report on his three months of experience in the United States. Specifically, he reported on the American sentiment against Japan's policy of monopolizing East Asia and the attitude towards naval disarmament conferences. It is reported that Konoe particularly emphasized that American feelings towards Japan's invasion of China and its ambition to dominate East Asia are extremely negative, and therefore diplomatic efforts are needed to ease the atmosphere. Osumi asked a few questions, and Konoe left at 11:30. Konoe is also scheduled to depart from Tokyo at 8:20 tomorrow morning to meet with Elder Saionji in Gotemba to make the same report, and will return to Tokyo the same day.

<p>Foreign Ministry Official Seki Yoichi from Nagasaki recently came to Nagasaki to inspect the immigration training center. According to Seki, Brazil has banned large-scale immigration. Therefore, Japanese immigrants must find new territories. Geographically speaking, the most suitable region for immigration is arguably the Eastern Hemisphere. Besides Manchuria, large-scale immigration to the South Seas (Nanyang) is necessary in the future. Nagasaki is a crucial point on the sea route to the South Seas, so the importance of the Nagasaki immigration training center will also temporarily increase. (4th, Hua-lian Telegram)</p>

<p>Japan's Three Ministries (Foreign Affairs, Army, and Colonization) Reach Consensus</p>
<p>Councilor Tani Returns Home with Private Plan Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before obtaining an ideal plan for reforming the institutions in Manchuria, the government intends to continue the current system and improve its operation. On the other hand, the opinions of the three ministries—Foreign Affairs, Colonization, and Army—seem to have aligned as follows: (1) Reorganize the administrative institutions in Manchuria from a national perspective, avoiding reorganizations that would damage Manchuria's independence or arouse international suspicion, and seeking measures to ensure respect for Manchuria's independence. In short, everything must wait until Councilor Tani arrives in Tokyo and his reform plan is reviewed, after which the streamlining of affairs will be rapidly materialized. (4th, Den-tsu Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Councilor Tani, who carries a private plan for unifying institutions in Manchuria, arrived here at 7:30 this morning on the Fusang Maru. His remarks to reporters were as follows: Regarding the reform and strengthening of institutions in Manchuria, Treaty Bureau Director Kuri and key officials of the Foreign Ministry have conducted thorough investigations and seem to be bringing a finalized plan home. It is meaningless for a mere councilor to propose a private plan. As for the establishment of a three-in-one system in Manchuria, the Director of the Asia Bureau is planning it. However, given the changed situation in Manchuria today, it is difficult to avoid reforming and strengthening the unified institutions. This trip to Tokyo is only intended to absorb the atmosphere of Tokyo. Councilor Tani is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo at 7:15 tomorrow morning. (4th, Den-tsu Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>President Roosevelt Landed in Portland Today</p>
<p>The USS Houston arrived at the port at 11:30 this morning, and the President disembarked immediately. The President's wife was also at the port to welcome him. The Oregon artillery unit fired a 21-gun salute as a courtesy. The President looked radiant and smiled broadly. After disembarking, he went to the site of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River and gave a brief speech, outlining his social policies. After the speech, he and his entourage went to Spokane, Washington. (2nd, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Many important issues in the United States are currently awaiting resolution, and the congressional elections are not far off. Therefore, people expect President Roosevelt to deliver several speeches on his way from Portland to Washington. When President Roosevelt landed in Portland, his wife, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and Interior Secretary Ickes all came to welcome him. President Roosevelt will inspect the Northwest and review the Bonneville Dam project before returning to Washington by special train. Among those traveling with him will be several cabinet members and members of Congress. Today's drought is increasing the hardship for farmers, and the government's housing program is progressing slowly. Economic recovery has also made little progress during President Roosevelt's vacation. All these issues need President Roosevelt to supervise and promote their implementation. Therefore, the President will face a situation that tests his power after returning to Washington. It is widely believed that the government's new measures have reached the economic class, and while public opinion still supports the general outline of its policies, if the current decline in commerce continues, the opposition to the authorities' policies will inevitably increase.

<h3 id="e21">Overview of Honolulu <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Japanese-American Citizens are the Most Influential Group on the Island</p>
<p>Annexation to the Federation Will Inevitably Be Realized Sooner or Later</p>
<p>Honolulu Correspondence: President Roosevelt's visit to Honolulu this time, in today's subtle and unpredictable situation in the Far East, is indeed a thought-provoking event. What is the purpose of his visit? Before speculating, let us first look at the history and current situation of Honolulu.</p>
<p>History: Honolulu consists of twenty islands, large and small, of which eleven are uninhabited. It was discovered by Englishman James Cook 156 years ago. For most of the nineteenth century, it maintained its status as the Kingdom of Honolulu. In 1893, it became a republic. In 1900, during President McKinley's era, it was formally annexed to the United States. The total area of all the islands is less than that of Shikoku in Japan. Excluding the uninhabited islands, the total area is 6,454 square miles. According to the 1930 survey, the total population of Honolulu is 368,336 people, and the current estimated number is 380,211 people.</p>
<p>Races: From the perspective of race, the residents of Honolulu include 146,092 Japanese (including 6,461 Koreans), 63,052 Filipinos, 44,895 whites (Americans, British, Germans, and Russians), 28,224 mixed-race people between Hawaiians and other races, 27,588 Portuguese, 27,179 Chinese, 1,219 Spaniards, and 7,351 others.</p>
<p>Although it encompasses such a variety of races, there has never been racial prejudice or conflict, and it is regarded as a peaceful village in the Pacific, known as the birthplace of the Pacific Conference. However, after the incident involving the wife of Lieutenant McIntosh of the Navy in September 1932, in which two Chinese, Filipinos, and Japanese were identified as suspects, a major dispute arose. As a result, the antagonistic relationship between whites and Asian races has also intensified.</p>
<p>Citizens: Honolulu, like Alaska and the Philippines, is different from the states within the United States. It is an external territory of the United States, and its judicial and administrative affairs can be said to be entirely dominated by the governor and judges appointed by the President. However, there is one upper and one lower house. The upper house has fifteen members with a four-year term, and the lower house has thirty members with a two-year term. Currently, there are four Japanese-American citizens as members in the lower house, and there are also Japanese-American citizens as members in the county council. Among the 360,000 residents on the island, about 236,500 have citizenship, including 87,700 Japanese, 42,000 whites, 47,700 Hawaiians and mixed-race people, 15,600 Filipinos, and 15,600 Chinese.</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, Japanese people have the most citizens, accounting for more than one-third, and the trend is increasing. Currently, Honolulu also sends representatives to the U.S. Federal Congress, but they do not have the right to vote. Based on the current situation, it is only a matter of time before Honolulu is established as a state within the United States and its state rights are established. Roosevelt is taking advantage of his visit to Honolulu to conduct on-site investigations into the establishment of state rights, which is a clear fact. Once state rights are established, Honolulu will send one member each to the upper and lower houses of the Federal Congress, and it is not difficult to imagine that Japanese-American citizens will be elected as members at that time.

<p>Following Poland's occupation of Vilnius, Lithuania severed diplomatic relations with Poland for twelve years. Polish newspapers have recently predicted that Poland and Lithuania will soon restore diplomatic relations. However, Lithuania is somewhat skeptical about this. According to semi-official sources here, in addition to expressing goodwill to each other, Poland has not yet put forward specific measures for restoring diplomatic relations. Lithuania, on the other hand, is determined not to compromise on the recovery of the lost territory of Vilnius. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>

<p>The Benefits Obtained by the United States are Less Than Expected</p>
<p>(Washington) The commercial benefits obtained by the United States in the first half of this year after the United States recognized Soviet Russia are far less than expected. After President Roosevelt met with Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov last year, the two countries announced the restoration of diplomatic relations. At that time, it was widely believed that Soviet Russia's purchase of American goods would exceed US$100 million. According to statistics released by the Department of Commerce today, American goods imported into Soviet Russia in the first half of this year were worth a total of US$6,417,000, compared with US$2,429,000 in the first half of 1933, and US$74,981,000 in the same period in 1930. Statisticians point out that the devaluation of the gold dollar this year means that the above figures will be even smaller if calculated in Russian currency. To accurately compare this year's exports with last year's, this year's exports should actually be reduced by one-third. Therefore, the actual value of exports in the first half of this year is US$1,848,000. The Soviet Russian side believes that this pessimistic result is due to the obstruction of the Johnson Act. According to the Johnson Act, Soviet Russia, as a country that owes debts to the United States, cannot enjoy the benefits of American public and private loans. It is widely believed here that the settlement of debts may resolve the commercial difficulties between the United States and Russia and revitalize exports to Russia. (3rd, National Telegram)</p>

After a few hours, thousands of people, including amateur detectives and well-known private detective agency personnel, searched for this precious red briefcase. Finally, it was found in Newcastle, the place of origin. Then everyone felt relieved. As for why it was still in the place of origin, it was apparently because the label attached to the briefcase had fallen off, so it was returned to the place of origin. (3rd, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Planning a Large-Scale Vote to Create Public Opinion</p>
<p>(London) According to Moscow telegrams, Russia is quite worried about the future development because the relationship with Germany is still uncertain. Britain is also concerned about the situation in Germany, as are other small countries. The general impression is that this winter will be a great test for Hitler, and his future success or failure will be determined by Germany's economic problems. (3rd, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Nazi propaganda expert Goebbels is currently planning a large-scale propaganda campaign for his leader Hitler. Goebbels outlined his plan today, saying that between today and August 19, the day of the plebiscite, it is necessary to persuade more than 40 million voters to vote in favor of Chancellor Hitler concurrently holding the position of President of Germany. Every effort must be made to ensure that all German people vote. All voters will have their names marked off after voting. Male and female public and private employees must vote, otherwise they risk losing their jobs or being ostracized. Germans abroad, including sailors at sea, must also vote. Even people in labor camps and detention centers will be escorted by military police to the ballot box to vote. It is expected that the result of this vote will be a large majority for Hitler. At the same time, people across the country are now remotely meditating on the future of the motherland and the domestic and foreign disputes in front of the deceased President's bier. The fate of 65 million Germans is now entirely in Hitler's hands, and their safety cannot be determined quickly. The only thing Hitler uses to overcome these problems is the absolute dictatorial power that is unparalleled in all of Europe. (3rd, Reuters Telegram)</p>

Although this mainstay has collapsed, his immortal spirit will always remain in the world. Hitler will surely inherit the late President's legacy and lead the German people. He deeply understands Hindenburg's great achievements and his great personality. No one can surpass Hitler in this regard. Hitler is the leader of the new Germany and the guardian of German virtues. He will surely accomplish the unfinished work of the late Field Marshal." Papen then repeatedly advised the people to unite sincerely for the future of Germany and its mission for peace in Europe.

At that time, Chancellor Hitler will deliver a eulogy, which will be broadcasted to all regions by radio. The Ministry of Education has ordered students from all schools to gather at that time to respectfully listen to the Chancellor's speech. On August 7, the Presidential funeral will be held in front of the Tannenberg Memorial, which will also be broadcasted by radio. All schools will suspend classes to quietly listen.

<p>Foreign journalists in Neuteck City were allowed by the authorities to visit the late President's villa this afternoon to pay their respects to General Hindenburg's remains. They first entered the President's mourning hall. The President's remains were lying on the bed, covered with flowers and wreaths, with his hands crossed and his face serene, like sleep. The bed was made of metal and was very simple. A large wreath was placed on the bed, and four officers of the National Defense Force stood guard with swords on both sides. The remains were covered with a white felt cloth, on which was placed a bullet, because when Hindenburg was a lieutenant colonel, two bullets passed over his head during the Battle of Sadowa, and this was one of them. The foreign reporters then entered the President's former office, where a large portrait of the President's entire body was hung. There was also a glass cabinet displaying many trophies, all obtained by Hindenburg during the Battle of Sadowa when he was a lieutenant colonel. In his library, the walls were covered with honorary degrees, honorary citizen certificates, and doctoral diplomas that the President had received during his lifetime. The honorary sword hanging on the wall was given by the Japanese government after the Great War to praise the General's Bushido spirit. The dining room contained fine porcelain made by the French Sèvres factory, which was given by the German government on the President's 85th birthday. Finally, the reporters toured the gardens near the villa, where the President often strolled in the evenings. His ancestral tomb was also selected to be buried here. (3rd, Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Tannenberg is a vast plain with rivers and lakes separating it. There are eight square towers standing around, surrounded by city walls, resembling a fortress from the feudal era. This is the victory memorial for the late General Hindenburg. In August 1914, Hindenburg defeated the Russian army here, recovered lost territory, and rose to fame in one fell swoop. Afterwards, a monument was built to commemorate his achievements. Not far from the village, there is a small marble monument, which is a memorial to another Battle of Tannenberg in 1410, when Prussian King Magellan led a large army to fight and defeat the Teutonic Knights, establishing suzerainty. Therefore, Tannenberg is a historical memorial site in Germany. Now, General Hindenburg is buried here, and in front of his tomb is the battlefield where blood was shed in 1914, with countless crosses and tens of thousands of skeletons buried beneath it.

<p>(London) A correspondent for the Daily Mail in Beijing reported, "The whereabouts of Archduke Otto von Habsburg, heir to the Austrian throne, are currently unknown. Some say he is in Rome with his mother, Empress Zita (widow of former Emperor Charles II), to escape the summer heat, while others say he is recuperating in Vichy, France, with his siblings. However, residents of Steenokkerzeel (near Brussels, where the Archduke's family has resided in a villa since being exiled by the Austrian Republic) say that neither the Archduke nor his mother have been seen since March of this year. It is noted that Otto was originally studying at the University of Leuven, preparing a dissertation for a doctorate in political science, but did not appear for the recent examinations, which is considered strange by many. Although Archduke Otto has the freedom to enter and leave Belgium at will, he should consider Belgium's hospitality and refrain from participating in any conspiracies that could harm Belgium's friendly relations with other countries. Given the current tense situation, the Archduke's mysterious whereabouts have naturally led to rumors. Some even say he has secretly entered Austria." (4th Havas Telegram)</p>

We will immediately visit the Panchen Lama and He Yingqin to establish a public office. The Mongolian local administrative plan has already been approved by the Central Government, but since the Director of Guidance has not yet taken office, all facilities have not yet been prepared or implemented. The Mongolian Political Council's expenses have been approved by the Central Government at 30,000 yuan per month, but since it still needs to be audited, it has not yet been allocated. We can temporarily borrow from the Ministry of Finance. Prince De and Prince Yun are both working at the council's office. Since the council's office was moved out of Bailingmiao, it is now operating in nearby Mongolian yurts. The guards live in tents. The issue of building a new office has been addressed, and several sites have been selected within ten li around Bailingmiao, but in accordance with religious regulations, it must be designated by the Panchen Lama before a decision can be made. We plan to submit a budget to the Central Government to allocate construction funds. The twelve banners of Chahar have officially reorganized into a league, with the Central Government passing the eight principles of Mongolian autonomy. The Central Government's official order has not yet arrived. The former Security Chief and Lieutenant General Zhuo Tu Bajia Bu has been elected as the league leader, and Fu Ling'a is the deputy league leader. The wireless telegraph machine issued by the Central Government will be transported to Bailingmiao within days and distributed to the banners for use." (4th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e84">All Committee Members Survey Disaster <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua and Others Go to the Lower Reaches of Various Counties</p>
<p>Ma Lingfu and Others Go to the Upper Reaches of Various Counties</p>
<p>Anqing dispatch, since the beginning of summer this year, Anhui Province has been suffering from a long drought, and disaster has already formed along the river. The provincial government specially convened a temporary meeting of all provincial committee members at 6:00 PM on the 30th to decide to carry out drought relief work starting from the 31st. The chairman and all provincial committee members will personally go to more than ten counties along the river to investigate. Where there are dikes and sluices, permission will be given to open the sluices to irrigate fields if there is no danger of flooding. Therefore, after the regular meeting of the provincial government adjourned at 8:30 AM on the 31st, everyone set off in two teams. Provincial Government Chairman Liu Zhenhua, Provincial Party Affairs Special Commissioner Miao Peicheng, Education Director Yang Lian, Tongcheng County Magistrate Yu Yuying, and Engineer Fan Jiagan of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office took the Anfeng ferry to the lower reaches of various counties. Civil Affairs Director Ma Lingfu, Construction Director Liu Yiyan, Huaining County Magistrate Sun Peifang, Jiang Shihui, the first section chief of the Construction Department, and Xu Hansan, the eighth director of the Provincial Government Secretariat, took the Anzhen ferry to the upper reaches of various counties to inspect the drought prevention situation in their respective counties.</p>
<p>The provincial government has repeatedly received reports from various counties on the recent drought situation. The following is a record: (1) Huaining: No rain in the four borders, drought has appeared. The ponds and dams in the high-lying areas of the third, fourth, and fifth districts have dried up, and the seedlings have withered. Although water is drawn with difficulty in low-lying fields near the water, if it does not rain for several more days, the water source will also dry up. (2) Susong: Since the rain on June 28, it has been a month, and the seedlings have felt the drought. The newly built ponds and dams are mostly dry. (3) Wangjiang: There has been no rain for a long time, the ponds and dams are dry, and the seedlings have all withered. If it does not rain for a few more days, the disaster will be extremely serious. (4) Tongcheng: There has been no drop of rain for more than forty days, and the ponds built last year have been exhausted. (5) Dangtu: Mountain fields account for three-tenths, and most of the mountain fields have not been planted. Rain only started on July 20 and 21. (6) Wuhu: There has been no rain for a long time, and the entire territory is a polder village, so water can still be drawn for irrigation. However, the labor costs are too great in extremely high areas, and even if there is a harvest, it will not be worth the loss. Rain only started on July 20 and 21. (7) Fanchang: Mountain fields account for three-tenths. The bottom water of the newly built ponds and dams has been exhausted for a long time due to the drought. Villages with tides can only take care of the present, and about five-sixths of the area is affected by the drought. (8) Guichi: The drought-affected fields in each district account for about 70%. Although there has been rain in the entire territory, it has not penetrated. (9) Tongling: Two weeks of drought, seedlings withered. It rained on July 22, and the seedlings recovered slightly. (10) Wuwei: Mountain fields account for three-tenths, and polder fields account for seven-tenths. The mountain fields have all been affected by the drought. It rained on July 17. (11) Dingyuan: The areas most affected by the drought are the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts. Not only has the rice not been planted, but also beans and other items have not been planted, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. (12) Mengcheng: Although it has rained, it is still dry within thirty miles of the city. (13) Huoqiu: No rain for more than twenty days, and the disaster situation is quite serious. (14) Jiashan: The county is entirely an Okada, and the ponds and dams have long been exhausted. Not only has the body not been planted, but also miscellaneous grains have mostly withered. (15) Shexian: There are some signs of drought, and preparations are being made for prevention. (16) Xixi: No rain for fifty days, and all ponds and dams are now releasing water. (17) Ningguo: The weather is dry, and there are many places lacking water. (18) Jingxian: No rain for fifty days, and high and low fields have become scorched earth. (19) Jingde: Except for the third district, which rained on July 10, the rest are dry. (20) Hefei: Dry land is affected by drought, and polder fields can be harvested. (21) Chaoxian: No rain for more than a month, and drought has formed. Although there was a shower on July 16, it was of no help. (22) Lujiang: Okada is affected by drought. Although it has rained recently, it is not universal. (23) Chuxian: The county has 400,000 mu. If it rains before the beginning of autumn, 300,000 mu of drought-resistant crops can still be replanted. (24) Lai'an: The drought situation has formed, and there is no way to remedy it. If there is heavy rain in the next few days, it is still possible to replant mung beans and buckwheat. (25) Quanjiao: The high Okada land accounts for more than twice the amount of polder land, and all the transplanted seedlings have withered. (26) Xuancheng: There are slight signs of drought, but there was a through rain on July 21. (27) Guangde: No rain for two months, and the wasteland has formed. (28) Langxi: A long drought has caused a disaster, but it rained on July 20. (29) Taihu: High-lying areas have slightly become drought-stricken, and places near the river can still be irrigated. If there is heavy rain in three or four days, the loss will not be great. Other counties have turned from severe to light due to receiving through rain, and some have suddenly reported drought due to prolonged sunny weather. If it still does not rain for a long time, the drought will inevitably spread further (2nd).</p>
<p>Wuhu dispatch, Provincial Government Chairman Liu Zhenhua, Education Director Yang Lian, Provincial Party Affairs Special Commissioner Miao Peicheng, Provincial Government Secretary Cao Shaoying, and others took the Anfeng ferry from Anqing to Guangfengwei and Saozhougou in Dongliu County, and then inspected the disaster situation all the way through Datong in Tongling County, Liujadu in Wuwei County, and Digang in Fanchang County. They arrived at Wubu at 9:50 last night (1st). The heads of various agencies, leaders of gentry and business circles, and military police all welcomed them on the riverbank. After Liu and others landed, they went to the Southeast Hotel to meet with representatives from all walks of life. According to the talks, the drought situation witnessed in various places is rare in recent years. In the past, due to major flood disasters, only flood prevention was initially emphasized. Now that the drought situation has formed and there is a lack of sufficient drought relief equipment, now they can only relieve one point of drought, that is, reduce one point of suffering for the people. The matter is also urgent, so the way to provide emergency relief is to first consider the situation and persuade farmers to open the sluices to save the majority of farmland, because opening the sluices is not a major obstacle and can be closed immediately. Liu and others stayed for only two hours and then boarded the ship again, and set sail for He County at dawn this morning. After inspecting He County, they will go to Dangtu, and will return to Wuhu from Dangtu tonight to return to Anqing, planning to take another road to inspect the inland of southern Anhui (2nd).</p>

<p>The Western Route Army Captured</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Pseudo Division Commander Yu Xingzhou <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Has Been Escorted from Xiushui to Pingxiang</p>
<p>Important Bandit Xin Keming Was Also Captured</p>
<p>Pingxiang Newsletter: Yu Xingzhou, the commander of the Pseudo Independent 1st Division, who has wreaked havoc in northwestern Jiangxi for years, was captured alive by the Yue Sen Department of the 50th Division in Xiushui on July 10. After being reported, Liu Yinggu, commander of the Western Route Column, immediately telegraphed and ordered troops to escort him to the headquarters for interrogation. He was then escorted to the headquarters by a company of the 50th Division on the 26th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival at Headquarters: The people of Pingxiang, hearing that the bandit leader Yu had been captured, rushed to see him. When the escorted bandit Yu arrived in the county, the people rushed to see him, vying to be the first. For a time, the entrance to the headquarters of the longitudinal tunnel was full of people, blocking the road.</p>
<p>Yu Bandit's Background: Yu Bandit is from Xie in Pingjiang, Hunan. He is 26 years old this year. He is small, fierce, and brave, with bright eyes. Although his face is dark and his hair is disheveled, he shows no fear. He worked as a farmhand for two years, and then made a living as a boatman with his father. He also served as a soldier in the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the 35th Army for two years. His father still works as a boatman. He has a wife at home.</p>
<p>Experiences as a Bandit: In 1928, Yu Bandit served as a township farmer in Pingjiang and participated in the Red Bandit Riot. In 1929, he joined the Communist Party through Gao Yongsheng and served as the captain of the Pingjiang Guerrilla. In 1930, he served as the captain of the Red Guards when attacking Changsha. In 1931, he served as the battalion commander of the Red Police Guard Battalion of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Province. In the winter of 1932, he served as the commander of the Independent Regiment of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Military Region and a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xiutong Yifeng. In the spring of 1933, he served as a member of the Second Executive Committee of the Soviet of Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Province and as the Minister of Military Affairs of Xiutong Yifeng. In August of the same year, he was transferred to serve as the commander of the Independent 1st Division of the Red Army of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Military Bandits. On October 15, he was elected as an executive committee member at the Third Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers of the Pseudo-Provincial Soviet. Last autumn, he was repeatedly suppressed by the regiment, and his strength suffered losses. In February of this year, he was reorganized into the 4th Independent Regiment of the Red Army of Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Province, and he was reassigned as the regiment commander. Over the years, he has fought against the National Army hundreds of times, used guns hundreds of times, and been wounded three times. He has worked the longest and hardest in Yifeng, Xiushui, Tonggu, Fengxin, Gao'an, and other counties.</p>
<p>Special Talents in Life: Yu Bandit is physically strong and capable of wrestling with tigers. He is good at boxing and swimming. In peacetime, even a dozen people could not compete with him in combat. His fierce and domineering nature is his nature.</p>
<p>Twice Received Special Awards: In addition to having a wife in his old home in Pingjiang, he was introduced to Tang Yu, a graduate of the Red Army School and Minister of Women in Yifeng County, by the Marriage Department of the Provincial Soviet in 1929. Last year, during the Battle of Huangsha, Tang was captured by the 77th Division in Xiaoyao. In February of this year, he cohabited with Chen Ying, who is from Liuyang and a middle school student, through the introduction of the Provincial Soviet. She studied at the Red Army School, likes military affairs, and can also fight. The marriage certificate will be officially issued after the school's trial period is over (according to bandits' marriages, there is no ceremony, and the marriage is established when the County Soviet or Provincial Soviet issues a marriage certificate). Unexpectedly, the net of heaven is vast, and the good dream has not yet come true before he was captured.</p>
<p>Details of Capture: Since Liu Yinggu was stationed in western Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, he has repeatedly made outstanding achievements. Before and after the head of the bandit Gao Yongsheng was surrendered, countless bandit leaders were captured and surrendered. In April of this year, he ordered Yue Division to find a way to recruit Yu Bandit, but it was unsuccessful. Unexpectedly, on July 10, Yu Bandit led his troops to occupy the Shelinkeng area of Huangshagang in Xiushui. After being secretly reported, the 3rd Battalion of the 299th Regiment of the Yue Division pursued and suppressed him on the 13th. The bandits had already been defeated. The bandit led his troops to live in seclusion on Huangshagang Ridge. The ridge stretches for more than a hundred miles and is dangerous with forty-eight water gullies. The battalion searched on the ridge for a day and a night before discovering it in a cave. At that time, the bandit still had more than 20 guards who resisted stubbornly. After a lot of hand-to-hand combat, all of them were disarmed and Yu Bandit Xingzhou and five other traffic officers, Yang Yongbiao, were captured together. After being identified by a surrendered person, they were escorted back to the headquarters and reported to the superiors.</p>
<p>Pre-Trial Interview: The reporter once spoke with Yu Bandit. The reporter asked, "Why do you want to be a bandit and do evil?" Yu Bandit replied, "I have not studied and do not understand politics. My actions are completely commanded by the political commissar. Now that I have been captured here, I know that this is the road to light." Asked, "When did you become a division commander?" Replied, "I became a division commander step by step. The Communist Party of China is usually very satisfied with me. They have repeatedly sent political personnel to talk to me, probably because they think I have three advantages. One is the farmhand class, two is a few years of fighting history, and three is firm political belief. But I believe that charging into battle is my strength, and I am sure of leading troops, which is my ability." When he spoke, he often smiled fiercely, as if he had little intention of repentance.</p>
<p>Pseudo Division Commander Yu Xingzhou</p>
<p>Overview of the Trial: On the morning of the 27th, Liu Yinggu ordered Chief of Staff Guo, together with Judge Chen, to open a court to try Yu Bandit. At 6:00 PM, Liu personally appeared in court for review and invited Xu Zhigan, Chief of the Staff Office of the Western Route Headquarters, Li Bofen, Acting Chief of the Military Law Office, Wang Bangshu, Liaison Staff Officer of the Xingying, Wei Suzhou, Administrative Commissioner of the Second District, and Liu Xuehao, former Director of the Political Department of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Military Region who was appointed as a colonel after surrendering, to attend the trial. Record Secretary Li Zengyu instructed Yu Bandit to state his experiences as a bandit in court. Yu confessed without concealment. The most important thing was that Commander Liu asked, "Why didn't you surrender earlier? Have you not seen the leaflets distributed by our headquarters welcoming your surrender?" Yu replied, "I don't know. Because I am illiterate, I don't know how to surrender." He also asked, "How many guerrillas are there still in the northwestern Jiangxi area?" Yu replied, "There are six more, with a total of more than a hundred guns. Many have been seized. There is one in each of Tianbao, Xiaoyao, Dongzhuang, Ganfang, Huangsha, and Shixi." He also asked, "Why was Kong Hechong transferred to a pseudo-central position?" Yu replied, "The central government said that he was impractical and that he had suffered too many losses." He also asked, "How many guns does your own unit still have?" Yu replied, "There are still about a hundred guns." He also asked, "How many guns does Xu Bandit Yangang have?" Yu replied, "The original department had only dozens of guns after being reorganized into the 46th Regiment. Recently, they have been repeatedly surrounded and seized by the National Army. Each gun has only one row of bullets. It is heard that Xu has fled to Jingbei with dozens of people." The interrogation lasted for three hours before the court was adjourned. Yu Bandit was still taken back into custody. After a short rest, Xin Keming, the Provincial Committee Member of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi District and Minister of White District Work, was brought in for interrogation.</p>
<p>Request for Instructions on Handling: Commander Liu telegraphed to the Western Route Headquarters yesterday, saying, "Commander He of Changsha General Headquarters, according to the report of Division Commander Yue, captured the pseudo-division commander Yu Xingzhou alive and the report of Division Commander Zhu captured the pseudo-provincial committee member Xin Keming alive. They have arrived at the headquarters one after another. I personally appeared in court and invited Liaison Staff Officer Wang of the Xingying, Director Xu of the Headquarters, Military Law Officer Li, Liu Xuehao, Advisor, Commissioner Wei, and others to attend the joint trial and interrogation. According to Yu Xingzhou's confession, he served as platoon leader, squad leader, company battalion commander, commander of the Independent 4th Regiment, commander of the Independent 1st Division, and a member of the Executive Committee of the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet, Minister of Military Affairs of Xiutong Yifeng, and other important pseudo-positions. Xin Keming confessed that he had served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Soviet and served as the Minister of Security Zone Work, and White Zone Inspector. Each directly admitted without concealment, and Liu Xuehao, Advisor, proved in court that he knew the two bandits and that they were indeed the same people and had held important positions. In particular, Yu Bandit Xingzhou was fierce and good at fighting and was a contemporary figure of Kong Bandit Hechong, who was always valued by Kong Bandit. After investigation, Yu Xingzhou and Xin Keming are both important members of the bandits. After repeated inquiries, their confessions have been recorded in the file. In addition to submitting a copy of the confession, I would like to ask whether the two bandits should be escorted to Changsha to await your interrogation, or whether they should be tried near Pingxiang by your department. I am awaiting your telegraphic instructions, Liu Yinggu." (July 28)</p>

<p>丨Various Counties Request to Open Sluices for Water Diversion丨</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch, the drought in Anhui Province is almost all over the province. Although there were slight showers a few days ago, the farmland benefited very little. Recently, it has still been abnormally early, with an average temperature of more than 1023 degrees, which is very hot. The upper reaches of Tongling, Chaoxian, Tongcheng, and other places are particularly severely affected, and food and water are difficult to maintain. Rice grains are no longer transported. To prevent food shortages among the people, they have all come to Wuhu to purchase large quantities of rice from various rice mills and transport them to Datong and other places. In a few days, the price of rice, which was six yuan per stone, has soared to nine yuan and several jiao, and there is still a tendency to continue to rise. It is now found that the market price of rice from the upper machine is nine yuan and three jiao per stone, the secondary machine is eight yuan and seven jiao, and the second time is seven yuan and six or seven jiao. Wheat and other miscellaneous grains are also firm and popular. Jin and Hu and other places have sent personnel to stay and let go of procurement. There are three to four thousand stones traded every day. Shangzhou wheat is currently sold for three taels and eight qian per stone, ordinary three taels and six qian, and three taels and two or three qian. The reason why rice prices are soaring is that the mainland is preventing famine and the source is not surging. However, the transaction of large-scale rice businesses between Guang and Chao gangs is still stagnant, because the sound of ordering foreign rice is very loud, and Annan rice takes the opportunity to sell cheaply in southern China.</p>
<p>Various counties have reported to the provincial government on the serious drought and requested to open the sluices for water diversion. The Construction Department has already formulated six measures for opening the sluices to prevent drought and has telegraphed them to various counties for strict compliance: (1) If the villagers request to open the dikes for water diversion due to force majeure, the inner dikes should be reported to the local water conservancy branch for approval, and the Jiang dikes should be reported to the county magistrate and the stationed dike committee for joint inspection and approval, and sufficient soil and pile materials should be prepared to ensure that they can be rushed to build at any time before they can be opened according to the instructions; (2) A guarantee shall be provided for requesting the opening of a dike to be responsible for its protection and repair. The guarantee period shall be until the end of September next year; (3) The length of the dike that may be opened shall be limited to the date of blocking and building, and shall be carefully verified by the person in charge of approval; (4) The person in charge of approval shall indicate the location of the dike to be opened to avoid any danger; (5) The person in charge of approval shall prepare a report on the location, shape, and length of the dike to be opened, together with the guarantee provided by the villagers, and send it to the county government in time to be classified and recorded in a special register, and registered and stored separately, and reported immediately after the blocking is completed and the verification is solid for registration and investigation; (6) The county government shall report the location, shape, and length of the dike opened to the Construction Department at any time according to the report, so as to pay special attention to it during flood prevention. This also implies the meaning of prevention in the midst of drought relief. (2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e87">Request for Demolition of the Fragrant Grass River Dam Foundation <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>To Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: The cunning people of Danyang, including Ma Xiting (also known as Ma Qipei and Ma Xiting), are malicious and disregard the law and reason. During this time of severe drought, they built a dam on the Fragrant Grass River in the Jiuli area of the county, cutting off the public water supply downstream. The affected people have repeatedly elected representatives to petition the provincial government and various legal organizations to appeal. The dam has not yet been opened, and the suffering downstream is evident. Considering only Jintan County, not only is there no water to irrigate the farmland, but drinking water has also dried up. The lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the county are in imminent danger. Therefore, it is necessary to truthfully and tearfully explain the relationship of the river, the reason for building the dam, the situation of the suffering, the comparison of gains and losses, and the excuses of the culprits to your Excellency, the Chairman. First, the river meanders for hundreds of miles, and each county calls it by different names. In Danyang, it is called the Fragrant Grass River, in Jintan, it is called the Taiping River, and in Liyang and Yixing, it is called the Li Canal. The water flows in from the Yangtze River, passes through the southern countryside of Danyang and Zhenjiang counties, enters the western countryside of Jintan, passes through the eastern countryside, and finally reaches the lakeside of Liyang and Yixing. Furthermore, in the middle reaches of Tan County, it branches out like blood vessels, running through the entire county. Since the beginning of civilization, people have relied on this river as a source of irrigation for farmland and drinking water. In addition, the transportation of agricultural products, fertilizers, and seeds cannot be done without this river. This is the first thing to note regarding the importance of this river. Second, in Danyang, the upstream area, the fields are low and the river is high, while in Jintan and other downstream counties, the river is low and the fields are high. It is very easy to draw water upstream, but very difficult downstream. The cunning people, Ma Xiting, and others took advantage of this situation and suddenly built two dams, an upper and a lower dam, in the vicinity of Zini Han and the old county in Jiuli Town, Danyang County, in the second ten days of July. This severely blocked the water, allowing not a single drop to flow through. When the tide comes from the river, it can directly flow into the fields without the need for machinery or labor, thus achieving natural irrigation. The rent for the fields will be doubled, and the tenants will reap the benefits without labor. They believe that the construction of the dam is a clever feat of nature. The lower dam in the old county controls more than 1,000 acres of land, and the upper dam in Zini Han controls more than 20,000 acres of land, which are cultivated by the people living at the intersection of the three counties of Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Jintan. Ma Xiting and others deceived the provincial government and claimed that it was done by the people of several counties, but in reality, it was a small number of people seeking personal gain at the expense of the public. This is the second thing to note regarding the reason for building the dam. Third, since the two dams were built in the second ten days of July, the western countryside of Jintan was the first to suffer. In towns such as Shima Bridge, Xiyang, Qingfu, and Hezhixi Bridge, the lack of water to irrigate and save the farmland is already a tragic sight. Moreover, tens of thousands of residents are suffering from a lack of drinking water in this sweltering heat. To obtain half a bucket of muddy water, they must fetch it from more than ten miles away, resulting in widespread epidemics and countless deaths. Now, the rivers in the eastern, southern, and northern countryside have been successively cut off, and the severity of the disaster is unprecedented. All the fields in Jintan's countryside have access to rivers, and the riverbed is lower than the river flow, with the waterline being about ten feet. If the upstream dam had not blocked the source, no matter how severe the drought, there would be no reason for a lack of irrigation water. According to statistics, the farmland in the county that relies on river tides for irrigation is more than 700,000 acres. Now that the water source has been suddenly cut off, the loss per acre is calculated at ten yuan, amounting to more than seven million yuan. Furthermore, people are dying due to the lack of drinking water. The misery of the situation is beyond words. This is the third thing to note regarding the situation of the suffering. Fourth, the river water flows from the Yangtze River day and night, and of course, it is inexhaustible. If it is said that the river is low downstream and the water flows rapidly downwards, and the upstream will soon dry up, it should be known that according to the principles of water, the downstream flows out rapidly, and the upstream estuary naturally and rapidly flows in, without a moment's pause. This principle is very clear. Ma Xiting and others lack scientific knowledge and morality, so they have lost their conscience and dare to do what is wrong. The distance between the fields in these two places and the water surface is only one or two feet. If a public water-lifting machine is installed, the cost will be at most 7,000 yuan. If manual labor is used instead of a machine, it is already vastly different from the downstream, where cars are set up layer upon layer in high fields. However, in order to save the cost of 7,000 yuan, they disregarded the loss of more than seven million yuan downstream. A small number of people upstream are lazy, steal time, and sit and reap the benefits, while hundreds of thousands of people downstream are trapped in a dry ditch and cannot even save their lives. This is the fourth thing to note regarding the comparison of gains and losses. Fifth, the culprits who built the dam, including Ma Qipei, Chen Suigeng, Ouyang Hao, Wang Mingda, Li Daonan, Wei Xingguo, and Geng Hai'ao, actually petitioned the provincial government to protect the dam, claiming that the river was dredged by the people of Danyang and that the dam has a historical connection. In fact, this is completely unfounded and self-deceptive. The river stretches for hundreds of miles, from Zhenjiang and Danyang to Jintan, Liyang, and Yixing, and flows into the lake. It is a public river, so how can it be separated by a ditch? Furthermore, the riverbed at that location is shallow and narrow, while from Jintan downwards, it is deep and substantial. It is easy to access the river tide, and the water volume is sufficient. The fact that it has not been dredged for many years is already evident. As for the history of dam construction, according to the inscriptions at the site, during the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty, Li Jiwen built a dam in the old county area, and the Zhenjiang prefectural government punished him with caning and erected a stone tablet to prohibit it forever. This is enough to prove that dam construction in that area is prohibited. Recently, in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Zhou Juntang and others built a dam at the Dongxi River head and were sentenced to imprisonment. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, Governor Han Guojun and Military Governor Qi Xieyuan jointly issued a proclamation forever prohibiting the construction of dams in the Xiangcao River area. The representatives have presented it to the Civil Affairs Department for review. Now, the Republic of China has not changed, and the river has not changed either. How can right and wrong be reversed, and the consequence be turned into the cause? This is the fifth thing to note regarding the excuses and deceptions of the culprits. Ma Xiting and others deceive the government above and harm neighboring counties below. Now, hundreds of thousands of people downstream are barely breathing. Therefore, we urgently submit this petition, earnestly requesting the provincial government to quickly dispatch public security troops to demolish the dam foundation and send water police to station there for defense. We anxiously await your orders. Tu Yu, Standing Committee Member of the Jintan County Party Executive Committee, Bao Kan, Chief of the Jintan County Farmers' Association, Ma Yintang, Chairman of the Jintan County Chamber of Commerce, Tu Ding, District Chief of the First District, Sun Jiangzuo, District Chief of the Second District, Zhang Quan, District Chief of the Third District, Li Rui, District Chief of the Fourth District, Ling Zilian, District Chief of the Fifth District, and Yu Yongdi, District Chief of the Sixth District, respectfully bow.</p>

<p>Report on the Implementation of Resolutions from the National Financial Conference</p>
<p>丨Compiled by the Committee for the Rectification of Local Taxes and Levies, Ministry of Finance丨</p>
<p>One. Introduction</p>
<p>The resolutions passed at this financial conference have been summarized in the first implementation report, detailing the Ministry of Finance's handling process. All major cases are expected to be organized and initiated before July 1st. Subsequently, the responsibility for promoting and maximizing benefits largely falls on the provincial and municipal governments for actual implementation. Since January, documents and reports from various parties concerning the abolition of excessive taxes and levies have been received. The progress made, sufficient to be announced to the nation, is categorized by province for reference. Additionally, seven points requiring attention are listed as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The implementation of each case inevitably involves certain procedures. Provinces and cities face different situations, making immediate success impossible. The provincial reports announced in this issue represent the initial responses after the financial conference's conclusion. In the future, progress is expected to gradually extend outwards and advance systematically, meeting the nation's expectations.</p>
<p>2.  The abolition of excessive levies cannot be separated from the rectification of local finances. Thorough planning and gradual advancement are essential for complete effectiveness. The reports in this issue only signify a fresh start for the people. Complete rectification is necessary to eliminate the long-standing financial malpractices of local areas and eradicate the root of excessive levies.</p>
<p>3.  Among the resolutions, the rectification of land tax and the implementation of land registration are crucial. Many provinces are currently convening meetings to establish detailed implementation rules. Once the formal reports are submitted to the Ministry, they will be published successively.</p>
<p>4.  Establishing local budgets is the foundation of financial rectification. Many provinces are separately convening county magistrates for small group meetings to ensure more thorough discussions on local budgets. Provinces like Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already submitted informal reports. Further details will be made public upon the conclusion of the process.</p>
<p>5.  The central government's subsidies for local tobacco, alcohol, and license taxes have been allocated to local areas since July 1st. With direct management by local governments and leveraging local administrative power, tax revenues have increased. This greatly benefits the subsidy aspect. Allocation methods for stamp tax subsidies have also been determined, contingent on the extent to which each province abolishes excessive levies, followed by verification and allocation.</p>
<p>6.  The central government attaches great importance to provincial and municipal donation and tax supervision committees. The selection of personnel must be meticulous. After extensive consultation, preliminary lists have been drafted. Starting next month, local supervision committees will be established successively.</p>
<p>7.  On-site inspections are crucial for understanding local financial emergencies. Minister Kong of this Ministry has personally inspected the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. Commissioners have also been dispatched to inspect the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Gansu, Ningxia, etc. Other provinces are continuously selecting and dispatching inspectors.</p>
<p>Time flies, and two months have passed since the financial conference's conclusion. One month remains until the July 1st deadline for abolishing excessive levies. During this period, responsible personnel have diligently striven, daring not to slacken. However, considering the nation's high expectations, the current reports may not fully satisfy them. Nevertheless, the rectification of local finances is extensive and complex. Ministry of Finance personnel dare not shy away from difficulties due to the arduous nature of the task, nor dare they be negligent due to the responsibility lying with local areas. Local financial authorities in each province and city are all striving to implement the conference's resolutions, making genuine progress. It is deeply believed that future facts will continue to prove this, satisfying the nation.</p>
<p>Two. Summary of Provincial Reports</p>
<p>The enthusiastic response of provinces and cities in implementing the financial conference's resolutions to abolish excessive taxes and levies, as seen in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, etc., is detailed in the first implementation report. More recently, provinces such as Shandong, Fujian, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Ningxia, Gansu, Chahar, etc., have been implementing phased abolitions of excessive levies since July 1st. Jiangsu is also continuing to abolish the second batch of 98 types of miscellaneous county levies. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shandong Province: On July 14th, the Ministry approved the Shandong Provincial Government's report stating that the province's measures to abolish excessive levies in accordance with the financial conference's resolutions involve first abolishing provincial taxes that hinder central government revenue, such as tobacco leaf, trade, and yellow wine levies; those involving double taxation, such as meat market and theater levies; and those hindering transportation, such as road carriage, vehicle, foot, boat, and boat ticket levies, totaling 109,728 yuan (see Appendix 1). Together with various local county excessive levies totaling 31,174 yuan (see Appendix 2), the total amount abolished in the first phase is 141,562 yuan, which has been approved by the provincial government and implemented in July. The Ministry also approved the provincial government's reply stating that the Ministry's promulgated measures for rectifying business tax and merchant tax, reforming the land tax collection system, and eliminating temporary apportionments have been forwarded for compliance.</p>
<p>(2) Fujian Province: On July 17th, the Ministry approved the Fujian Provincial Government's report stating that Fujian Province, having suffered greatly from military conflicts, with the people deeply troubled by excessive levies, the Fujian Provincial Finance Department has abolished the most excessive and detailed taxes and levies in counties affiliated with the province, such as jasmine, chicken, goose, and duck levies, totaling 27 items with an annual amount of over 210,000 yuan (see Appendix 3). Investigations into the abolition of others are also underway. The Ministry also approved the provincial government's reply stating that the Ministry's promulgated measures for rectifying business tax have been submitted to the Finance Department for compliance. The Finance Department's report requesting a strict prohibition of arbitrary tax and levy increases beyond the regular tax has also been ordered to be followed. On July 25th, the Finance Department also reported that county regiment expenses had been proposed to the provincial government for abolition. If feasible, it is estimated that the province can reduce the people's burden by 900,000 yuan annually.</p>
<p>(3) Hebei Province: On July 10th, the Ministry approved the Hebei Provincial Government's report stating that Hebei Province has formulated implementation steps for abolishing excessive taxes and levies: (1) Abolishing provincial corvée, totaling 191,003 yuan annually; miscellaneous levies, totaling 60,010 yuan annually; and miscellaneous income, totaling 31,045 yuan annually, totaling 282,068 yuan. Also abolishing 90 types of county miscellaneous levies such as livestock transit levies, totaling 273,302 yuan annually (see Appendix 4), totaling 555,370 yuan. From July 1st, all those collected directly will be abolished. Those contracted to merchants with fixed terms ending before the end of December 1934 will be abolished upon expiration. Those with terms ending in 1935 should properly draft an advance abolition deadline, no later than the end of 1934, to comply with the general plan. (2) Supervising and ordering counties to properly draft abolition measures for the remaining levies, ensuring practical progress regardless of difficulties to achieve thorough implementation. (3) For the 51 counties where land tax surcharges exceed the regular tax, they have been reduced to within the regular tax range in accordance with the promulgated measures, and those equal to the regular tax, including Cang County and 31 other counties, have reduced a total of 799,000 yuan. The remaining 19 counties, including Wen'an, still need to reduce 596,000 yuan, and strict orders are still being given to reduce them within the deadline. The above has been submitted to the provincial government for approval and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. The Ministry also approved the provincial government's reply stating that the Ministry's promulgated measures for rectifying business tax have been distributed to subordinates for prompt compliance and resubmission after review.</p>
<p>(4) Henan Province: On July 18th, the Ministry received a report from the Henan Provincial Finance Department stating that Henan Province's first batch of abolished excessive taxes and levies includes 14 types (see Appendix 5) and 37 types of land tax surcharges (see Appendix 6). The Finance Department also reported the following proposed abolition steps: (A) All miscellaneous levies existing in each county, whose nature, according to the interpretation agreed upon at the financial conference, can be regarded as illegal or excessively harsh, totaling 32 types with 264,572 yuan, will be abolished uniformly by the end of 1934 by general order to each county. (B) County deed tax surcharges exceeding half of the regular tax, totaling 234,915 yuan, will be abolished uniformly starting in 1935. (C) All types of voluntary donations and taxes and levies not belonging to the previous two categories, totaling 352,019 yuan, are planned to be gradually cleaned up and abolished. The Ministry also approved the provincial government's reply stating that the measures to reform the land tax collection system and eliminate temporary apportionments have been forwarded for compliance.</p>
<p>(5) Hunan Province: On June 28th, the Ministry received a letter from the Hunan Provincial Finance Department stating that among the miscellaneous levies in Hunan Province that are the most burdensome and cannot be completely abolished immediately, the only two are militia defense and education funds. Regarding the militia defense funds, the Security Command has already vigorously reduced and reorganized the militia teams throughout the province and unified the collection and distribution of all militia defense expenses. All types of miscellaneous levies collected by counties for militia defense funds in the past, totaling more than 50 types with an annual revenue of 1.6 million yuan (see Appendix 7), have been abolished uniformly. An order has been issued by the provincial government to implement the abolition from July 1st and to announce a ban, prohibiting them from being used for other purposes. As for the various miscellaneous levies collected for education and other purposes, efforts are currently being made to plan, understand the actual situation in each county, and gradually abolish them within a feasible range. Legal taxes and levies that should be rectified will also be thoroughly enforced. The letter also reported that the resolution from the financial conference prohibiting arbitrary additions to taxes outside the regular tax has been universally ordered for compliance. The provincial government's reply regarding the elimination of temporary apportionments has also been forwarded for compliance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday for Medical Treatment and Returned to Beijing the Same Evening <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Wang Attended the Central Executive Committee Meeting Before Proceeding to Lushan</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming and Tang Youren Accompanied Him to Discuss Important Matters</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, along with his wife, Madam Chen Bijun, Zeng Zhongming, Chu Minyi, and others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Beijing by overnight train. He consulted Dr. Noel, a German physician, regarding his diabetes, and returned to Beijing by overnight train the same evening. He is scheduled to attend the Central Executive Committee meeting next Tuesday (the 7th) and then proceed to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Medical Consultation</p>
<p>President Wang and his entourage arrived at their residence on Bubbling Well Road yesterday morning at 7:00 AM after taking the overnight train from Beijing. At 8:30 AM, Dr. Noel, a German physician, personally visited Wang's residence to examine his chronic diabetes. The examination lasted one hour. According to Dr. Noel, Wang's diabetes levels have gradually decreased, and he was instructed to continue taking the new medication to achieve complete recovery.</p>
<p>Returned to Beijing the Same Evening</p>
<p>Wang's visit to Shanghai was solely for medical treatment, with no other tasks. Therefore, he did not meet with any guests. Furthermore, due to the complexity of government affairs in Beijing, he returned to Beijing last night with Zeng Zhongming and others on the 11:00 PM overnight train. As for Chu Minyi, he will remain to address the Summer Sports Class at Zhengfeng Middle School this morning and will return to Beijing tonight.</p>
<p>Trip to Jiangxi</p>
<p>Our reporter interviewed Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, yesterday. According to Chu, President Wang has been taking the latest medication for diabetes since the beginning of last month. Every two weeks, he comes to Shanghai for a check-up to test the efficacy of the new medication. He then stops taking the new medication for two weeks and returns for another check-up to compare. His diabetes levels have indeed decreased. When asked about Wang's trip to Jiangxi, Chu said that he is still waiting for a telegram from Chairman Chiang to make the final decision. According to reliable sources, Wang will attend the Central Standing Committee meeting next Tuesday (i.e., the 7th) and then proceed to Lushan to meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss important domestic and foreign policies. Zeng Zhongming and Tang Youren will accompany him.</p>
<p>Condolences for the German Loss</p>
<p>Chu also said that after the news of the death of German President Field Marshal Hindenburg, both Chinese and foreign countries expressed their condolences. The central government issued an order on the 3rd for all agencies to fly flags at half-mast for three days to express mourning. President Wang also sent me as his representative to the German embassy on the morning of the 3rd to express condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Date of the Fifth National Congress <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Mid-November in Beijing</p>
<p>To be Discussed at the Central Standing Committee Meeting on the 7th</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress will be held in Beijing in November. Representatives from the Southwest are also preparing to attend to discuss important issues related to foreign affairs and domestic policy. When our reporter interviewed Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, yesterday, he said that the date of the Fifth National Congress is scheduled for mid-November, but the exact date has not yet been determined. All organizational matters and regulations for the Congress will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion next Tuesday (i.e., the 7th) and announced in detail after a decision is made. This is because preparations must begin three months before the Congress, as is customary.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the abolition of the Southwest institutions, it is rumored that this will be submitted to the Fifth National Congress for discussion and decision. It is reported that the central government has not yet considered this, and the Southwest has not exchanged views with the central government on this matter. It is too early, and all parties are keeping silent.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The City Was Extremely Hot Again Yesterday <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Highest Temperature 100.4 Degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since the typhoon last month affected Shanghai, the temperature dropped to below 100 degrees Fahrenheit, providing some relief. However, recently it has risen again, exceeding 100 degrees. Yesterday at noon, dense clouds appeared, as if there would be rain, but the sun soon returned, and the temperature rose even higher. When a reporter inquired at the Xujiahui Observatory, it was said that today (i.e., yesterday) the highest temperature was 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 75.4 degrees. As for the two typhoons, one is located on Guam, currently at 18 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude, and has stopped moving, so there is no wind direction record. The other is in the Pacific Ocean, currently at 19 degrees north latitude and 137 degrees east longitude, heading northwest by west, with very weak wind force. According to reports received by the observatory, the daily wind force is only three degrees, with the center point at 120 miles. (Note: The wider the central area, the weaker the wind force, as the force has been dispersed.) Therefore, the wind force is also very weak.</p>
<p>Wang Kemin</p>
<h3 id="e96">Rescheduled to Qingdao Today <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Wang Kemin, Chief Advisor of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Readjustment Committee stationed in Peiping, has been staying in Shanghai for several days after meeting with Huang Fu in Moganshan. Wang was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday afternoon to meet with Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, in Qingdao at the invitation of Song Ziwen, but he was unable to do so due to waiting for a reply telegram from Huang Fu. According to Wang's statement to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, he has postponed his departure from Shanghai to tomorrow (i.e., today). According to a reporter's investigation, Wang is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Japanese ship Dalian Maru at 11:00 AM today.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Obtained Intelligence on Guizhou Province <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wang-You News Inconsistent</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Wang Jialie and You Guocai of Guizhou Province have been in a stalemate for two years. Recently, news of cooperation between Wang and You has been repeatedly reported from Guiyang, but You Guocai has not made any statement. To clarify the truth, a reporter visited Deng Mingjie, who is familiar with the situation in Guizhou. According to him, cooperation between Wang and You is what the people of Guizhou hope for, but it is difficult to achieve due to their conflicting interests. He then showed the reporter a telegram jointly signed by Wang and You to him, which read: "Mr. Deng Mingjie, Xun Jian: The situation in Guizhou has been turbulent for two years, all due to the incompetence of Wang Jialie, You Guocai, etc., who have failed to fulfill their duties and have burdened you with your concern. We are deeply grateful for your kindness in mediating and encouraging us. We feel guilty and deeply grateful. The only way forward is to unite to meet expectations. Recently, we have been troubled by bandits harassing the borders of Guizhou. Jialie and others have a responsibility to defend the borders and should exert our utmost sincerity and work together to quickly quell the bandit atmosphere, respect our homeland, and serve the Party and the country to atone for our sins. Jialie and Guocai met in Guanling County this month and have completed discussions on all bandit suppression plans and post-Guizhou situation matters and will implement them sequentially immediately. Jialie will first return to the province on Ganjing Day, and Guocai is also scheduled to rush to Guiyang within ten days after the conclusion of local affairs to serve together. We still hope for your guidance from time to time, so that we may have something to follow and not fail to meet expectations. We respectfully report to you, hoping for your observation. Respectfully, Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government and Commander of the 25th Army; You Guocai, Member of the Guizhou Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Province, respectfully salute, Gan Yin, sent from Guanling," etc. However, You Guocai's individual telegram differed greatly. The original text is as follows: "Mr. Deng Mingjie, Cijian: Recently, I received a message from Provincial Committee Member Huang Pimo stating that the situation in Guizhou is chaotic, and the red bandits are invading the border, posing an extremely dangerous situation. Cooperation is necessary to eliminate the communists, and separation of military and civilian affairs is necessary to govern. Shao Wu, in view of the difficult environment, strongly advocates the separation of military and civilian affairs, wanting to entrust civilian affairs to talented individuals to achieve the effect of cooperation, and urged me and Shao Wu to meet first, scheduled to meet in Guanling on You Day. In addition to the talks, it turned out that what he called separation of military and civilian affairs only wanted to give me the position of Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and important issues such as the spirit of cooperation, security plans, and communist suppression strategies were not mentioned at all. I saw his inconsistency and immediately declined tactfully. After he returns to the province, how he reports to the central government and neighboring provinces is still unknown, or he may even use this to publicize and confuse the public. It is difficult to predict. I believe that the political disorder and the people's suffering in Guizhou have reached their peak. Tracing the origin of the disaster, is it not all due to the negligence of those in power, the use of petty people, and the neglect of government affairs, the greed for pleasure, and the disregard for the people's livelihood? If we can thoroughly realize this, be open and honest, and work together to govern, we may be able to cooperate and achieve something. It is a pity that he does not pay attention to reality and hopes to perfunctorily meet. There is no determination to improve, nor is there a concrete plan. This is like climbing a tree to catch a fish. I have not seen its possibility. Guocai respectfully salutes," etc.</p>
<p>Submission from the Bankers Association</p>
<p>Requesting a Temporary Suspension of the Savings Bank Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding the amendment of the Savings Bank Law, which read: "Submitted for the matter of request. Recently, the member banks of the Association reported that they had received instructions from the Ministry on July 28 regarding the promulgation and implementation of the Savings Bank Law. According to the provisions of Article 9 of the law, each of the banks concurrently operating savings banks should submit government bonds and treasury bills equivalent to one-quarter of the total savings deposit balance, calculated at the market price, to the Central Bank immediately, obtain receipts, and submit them to the Ministry for verification. A letter has also been sent to the Central Bank to properly determine the custody measures, etc. How should this be handled? Please make a public decision. At the meeting held by the Association today (31st), it was unanimously agreed that government laws and regulations should be followed. However, since the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the Association, in view of the articles contained therein, has felt that many of them are difficult to implement in practice and have submitted a request to the Ministry for review and approval, and publicly recommended representatives to meet with Director Xu of the Ministry to explain the various difficulties. We are extremely grateful for his willingness to listen and promised to find a way to remedy them. The entire Savings Bank Law is still in the process of being submitted for amendment, and the submission of government bonds and treasury bills does not fully comply with the full text of Article 9 of the law. The banks of the Association have not yet been informed of the Central Bank's custody measures. It was resolved that, in order to protect depositors and to be serious about operations, Article 9 of the law should be temporarily suspended pending a decision on the entire Savings Bank Law. In addition to submitting the difficulties in implementing the law to the Executive and Legislative Yuan for selection, we should prepare a document and submit it to the Ministry for review and approval, and request instructions to comply. This is in the public interest. We respectfully submit."</p>
<p>Delegates to the National Labor Conference</p>
<h3 id="e98">Li Pingheng and Others Returned to China Yesterday <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Excellent Results in the Election of Directors and Factory Inspections</p>
<p>Li Will Go to Beijing Tonight to Report and Return to Shanghai to Take Office</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Pingheng and his party of seven, representatives of China to the 18th International Labor Conference, returned to Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde at 11:00 AM yesterday. Li is scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing tonight to report on the progress of his participation in the conference. The details of his arrival in Shanghai are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The representatives to the International Labor Conference who arrived in Shanghai yesterday included Li Pingheng, First Government Representative; Bao Guohua, Advisor; and He Jing, Secretary; An Futing, Labor Representative; Cheng Haifeng, Advisor; Zhang Yi, Secretary; and Wang Zhisheng, Capital Representative. Qian Chengxu, Capital Advisor, remained in Europe due to other matters and will return to China in October. When the representatives arrived at the Jianghai Customs Pier at 11:00 AM, various organizations in Shanghai, including the China Industrial General Federation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Commerce, the Machine Industry Association, and the General Labor Union, sent representatives to the pier to welcome them. After disembarking, they went to the China Hotel to rest. The China Industrial General Federation and the National Federation of Commerce held a public banquet at the Yiyou Society on Third Road at 6:00 PM last night and invited the representatives to report on the details of their trip to the conference. (The content of the report was roughly the same as the written statement released, and the length of the statement is omitted.)</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Government Representative Li Pingheng released a written statement saying that the results of attending the conference were very good. In addition to participating in the discussion of the agenda set by the conference, the mission entrusted to him when he left the country was (1) to participate in the election of the Board of Directors of the International Labor Organization, and (2) to negotiate the Shanghai Concession Factory Inspection Case. Both of these matters have achieved good results.</p>
<p>Elected as Director</p>
<p>China has never been successful in the election of directors. This time, with 60 votes out of 61, an absolute majority, China was elected as the second non-permanent director. Other elected countries include Spain, Poland, Finland, Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Brazil, and Mexico.</p>
<p>Factory Inspection</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai Concession Factory Inspection Case, it has been one of the main disputes between China and the Shanghai Concession in recent years. Negotiations have been ongoing for several years without results. At this conference, Representative Li raised this matter and received the support of representatives from various countries. Mr. Batter Liu, Director of the International Labor Bureau, replied that he would do his best to resolve this case in the short term after the meeting so that China's factory inspection could proceed smoothly. After the meeting, Representative Li also personally visited the United Kingdom and France and discussed solutions with French Minister of Labor Magoti, British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Stanhope, and Undersecretary of Labor Roman. The results were very satisfactory. This matter should be resolved satisfactorily in the short term.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>The conference lasted for three weeks. In addition to the election of directors, the conference passed draft conventions on shift breaks in glass factories and relief for unemployed workers, and revised draft conventions on prohibiting night work for women and compensating for occupational diseases. In addition, several resolutions were passed. However, there were no concrete results on the reduction of working hours (from 48 hours per week to 40 hours), which was of concern to all parties, and it was reserved for discussion at the next conference.</p>
<p>Labor Organization</p>
<p>The reporter asked Representative Li about the situation of the International Labor Organization, as the Chinese people are not clear about the situation of the International Labor Organization. According to Representative Li, the International Labor Organization is a product of the 1918 Paris Peace Conference. At that time, representatives of various countries at the meeting believed that world peace, in addition to political issues, should also pay attention to economic and social issues. Therefore, special chapters were set up in the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties to establish the International Labor Organization to jointly seek solutions to global labor problems through international cooperation. A conference is held once a year, and each member state sends one labor representative, one capital representative, and two government representatives to organize it, which is the highest authority of the labor organization. The daily affairs of the organization are handled by the International Labor Bureau. The scale is quite large, with more than 500 staff members. Branches are set up in major countries. The Board of Directors of the International Labor Organization is the supervisory body of the Labor Bureau, and its status is equal to the Council of the International Labor Organization. There are 32 directors in total, with labor and capital each occupying eight seats, and government representatives occupying 16 seats. Among these 16 seats, eight seats are permanently held by the main industrial countries: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, India, and Belgium. The other eight seats are elected by the conference every three years. Although China is an original member of the Labor Organization, it has never been elected in the past 16 years. This is the first time it has been elected. There are currently 57 members of the Labor Organization, which is more than the members of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Entering Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Government Representative Li Pingheng is scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing tonight to meet with Minister Chen, report on the progress of the trip, and ask for instructions on the date of taking office as a director of the International Labor Conference, and then return to Shanghai to set off. Therefore, it is expected that he will not be able to attend the meeting of the Board of Directors of the International Labor Conference in October in time. As for the other representatives, they plan to compile a report in Shanghai before going to Beijing.</p>
<p>Circular from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3 id="e99">Method for Transporting Silver <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Transport from Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin to the Interior</p>
<p>Requires a Passport Issued by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a directive yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Trade Association stating: "Concerning the matter that transporting silver requires application to the Ministry for a passport before transport can commence, the original purpose was to prevent the private minting of silver in the interior. All silver existing in the interior, except for that requested to be minted or exchanged for silver standard currency, is not allowed to be used. Now, to facilitate merchants and civilians, a further notice is hereby issued: henceforth, anyone transporting silver from the interior to Shanghai, Hankou, or Tianjin should follow established procedures at each customs station. However, anyone transporting silver from Shanghai, Hankou, or Tianjin to the interior, or transporting it between these three places, must, in accordance with the previous order, apply to the Ministry for a passport before transport can commence. Apart from informing the Jianghai, Jianghan, and Jinhai customs superintendents and the Inspector General of Customs for implementation, this order is hereby issued for compliance. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e100">Relief for the Drought in Gaoqiao <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau Orders Workers to Continue Pumping Water for Over Sixty Hours</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the severe drought in the Gaoqiao district of Pudong has been reported on several occasions. It is now known that the Social Affairs Bureau previously allocated a water pumping machine, which was installed in the Jiangjiazhai area of Donghai. However, due to a lack of iron pipes, water output was delayed. The Bureau specially purchased additional iron pipes from the Shenfa Factory, which were transported to Pudong for installation at 7 PM last night. Residents along the heart of the river in the Pudong area were dissatisfied due to insufficient water pumping from the construction of dams. They collectively criticized the local farmers' association. Upon hearing this, the Municipal Farmers' Association immediately dispatched Secretary-General Yu Zhenhui and Deputy Secretary-General Zhang Huijun to provide guidance at 6 AM yesterday. They also joined representatives from the district to request the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau in the central district to forward a request to the Dredging Bureau for additional water pumping. Secretary-General Yu then delegated Secretary Zhang Tingrong to discuss with Tian Heqing of the Social Affairs Bureau the prompt implementation of water pumping with the Dredging Bureau. Director Song Ziliang also expressed great concern about the agricultural disaster and agreed to instruct the relevant staff to continue pumping water for sixty hours. This severe drought in the district can thus be mitigated to some extent.</p>

<p>Colleagues of Both Railways</p>
<h3 id="e103">Held Their First Luncheon Yesterday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>And Celebrated Director Huang's Overseas Inspection Trip</p>
<p>Colleagues from the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways held their first luncheon at 12:30 PM yesterday on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. They also bid farewell to Director Huang Boqiao of the Bureau, who will soon depart to inspect railway administration in Europe and the United States. On that day, in addition to 245 colleagues from the Bureau, those present included Mrs. Huang, who is traveling with Director Huang, and Director Huang's accompanying secretary, Dr. Luo Yimin. Also present were the first director of the Jinghu Railway, Zhong Wenyao, now a member of the Jinghu Railway Council, the health consultant of both railways, Weng Zhilong, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Li Ting'an, and the deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Wharf Management Office, Gao Shu'an, who also temporarily joined. During the luncheon, Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng stood up to deliver a speech, first introducing Director Huang, Mrs. Huang, Dr. Luo, and Councillor Zhong, Consultant Weng to the attendees. He then spoke about the significance of the luncheon and expressed the hope that Director Huang would take care of his health after going abroad, provide guidance to colleagues at any time, and stated that Director Huang's sense of responsibility was always focused on the bureau's affairs. He said that even during this overseas trip, Director Huang's spirit would undoubtedly remain with the bureau, and he hoped that all colleagues would dedicate themselves to their work with this spirit. Director Huang then gave a speech explaining the reasons for his overseas inspection of railway administration, describing the work he had done in the past year and a half, and the recent progress of the business. He expressed the hope that his colleagues would continue to work hard and encouraged them to serve the railway as a form of serving the country. He also stated that during his overseas inspection, the duties of the director would be legally delegated to the deputy director. The gathering concluded with joy at around 3 PM.</p>
<p>Land Bank Protection Project Commences</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The bank protection project along the Majiabang area in the 43rd district of the Pudong Land Bank has suffered from disrepair and severe damage over the years. Last autumn, high tides caused the inundation of farmland and crops in the area, even causing the Shanghai-Chuansha Railway to be shifted elsewhere. The local losses are significant. Currently, the office of the Municipal Committee of the district has specially requested permission from the Public Works Bureau to carry out the repairs locally to prevent future disasters. Recently, the staff in the district have worked tirelessly despite the summer heat to establish height markers, which have already been completed. At 9 AM yesterday, a groundbreaking ceremony was held, attended by hundreds of people including Section Chief Xu Guansan and Technician Dai from the Public Works Bureau, Director Wang of the 5th Precinct of the 3rd District of the Public Security Bureau, and Committee Member Zhang Qiwen from the district. Section Chief Xu presided over the groundbreaking ceremony, followed by a tour along the bank protection area. Work is currently being intensified, and the success of the project is assured. Section Chief Xu and others inspected the bank protection area under the scorching sun, sweating profusely, demonstrating extreme dedication. The farmers along the way were all moved and expressed their admiration and respect.</p>
<p>Hongkou Epidemic Hospital</p>
<h3 id="e104">Report on Consultations for July <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Epidemic Atmosphere Intensifies Again in Eastern Shanghai</p>
<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital on Tangshan Road, organized by the Ji Yi Charity Association, has been in operation for three years. It has been managed by Dou Yaoting, Zhu Shien, Ying Zuoqing, and Li Quancai. This year, Feng Bingnan joined as honorary president and Zhu Meixian as vice president, jointly responsible for the hospital. Therefore, the hospital's operations are thriving. The hospital's affairs are managed by Bao Kangning and Xu Zaigao as directors, divided into departments such as documentation, accounting, and general affairs. Although the organization has only six people, they can adequately handle various affairs. In terms of medical affairs, the directors are Zhu Xiaofang and Lin Chunshan, who have accumulated more than twenty years of experience in epidemic treatment and have gained many insights. They also have the support of renowned doctors such as Baodel, Fansier, and Bianlisi, and the responsible treatment of doctors Lin Xiongfei, Shi Yongqi, Zhang Zidao, and Jiang Hansheng. There are also four doctors interned in the hospital to gain experience. The pharmacists and nurses are also outstanding talents of the time. Therefore, those seeking treatment from far and near are like water flowing into a ravine, earning the trust of the public. Now, upon learning of the hospital's July report, it is promptly recorded below, which those concerned about the social situation will be pleased to hear. There were 12,692 outpatient visits, with 11,048 from the concession and 1,644 from the Chinese area, 818 return visits, 2,780 vaccinations, and a total of 1,606 hospitalizations, averaging 50 per day. There were 19 surgeries, more than 300 critical cases, and 8 patients who could not be saved. The hospital received $410 in first and second class hospitalization fees and $7,364.88 in donations from various sectors. The hospital's expenses have always been borne by the hospital directors, but because of its outstanding performance, donations from various sectors have been very enthusiastic. It is reported that recently, there have been 400 to 500 outpatient visits per day, mostly severe cases of dysentery, with temperatures above 104 degrees, requiring acupuncture treatment. The expenses are quite high. There are also several critical cases of heatstroke every day. Therefore, the epidemic situation is still increasing. The weather has been continuously sultry, the poor lack of hygiene, and there have even been cases of true cholera. Social concerns cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Daxing Company</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Fuxing Vessel, Grounded, Safely Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Daxing Shipping Company's Fuxing vessel, operating the Shanghai-Chongsha route, ran aground on the evening of the 1st of this month. The vessel departed from Qidong for Shanghai, carrying a significant amount of passengers and cargo. That evening, while navigating near Miaogang in Chongming, due to a momentary oversight, it ran aground on a shallow sandbar. It was unable to get out of danger that night. The next day, vigorous attempts were made, but due to the heavy load and deep draft, they did not achieve their goal. The passengers on board, suffering from the heat and stuffiness, voluntarily waded to the shallow shore of Miaogang and then transferred to the Baohua vessel of the Ping'an Shipping Company to Shanghai. The poor passengers and merchants in steerage class, unable to afford another ticket, had to remain stranded until the evening of the second day. When the tide rose, the vessel broke free from the shallow beach at full speed, allowing it to escape danger and return to Shanghai. Although the cargo on board was not severely damaged in this grounding, a significant number of chickens, ducks, and fresh goods were lost due to the heat, starvation, death, and spoilage over the two days. After the Fuxing vessel arrived in Shanghai, it was inspected and found not to have suffered any damage to the hull, which is fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Rickshaw Problem Remains Serious <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Vehicle Committee Will Begin Distributing Business Licenses on the 7th</p>
<p>Public Discussion on the 6th; Rickshaw Owners Have Prepared Opinions</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council convened both parties to discuss a solution to the rickshaw problem in the Public Concession, but due to the insistence of both parties, no result was achieved. Therefore, the severity of this problem remains far from optimistic. The following is a detailed account of the information obtained by the Xinxin News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Rickshaw Association Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, a responsible person from the Rickshaw Management Committee stated that although the chairman of the Council, Mr. Massey, also participated in the meeting convened by the Municipal Council to discuss with the rickshaw owners, this was only a preliminary discussion to gather opinions and did not involve any specific suggestions. The report that Mr. Massey firmly rejected the opinions of the rickshaw owners is not factual. As an affiliate of the Municipal Council, the Council has no authority to change its principles. The current opposition of rickshaw owners to the registration of rickshaw pullers is a misunderstanding. Labor relief in various countries is by no means based on a small amount of charity but must thoroughly improve the treatment of workers and provide their occupation with a corresponding guarantee, enabling them to maintain their minimum living standards. Otherwise, with too many monks and not enough gruel, everyone will be driven to desperation, which is not a reasonable method of relief. Rickshaw owners have stated that the death or illness of some of the 50,000 rickshaw pullers will affect business. This is not difficult to address, and the Council has its own methods to deal with it. As for raising fares, this is only a "hypothetical" standard price set by the Council. The Council will never force rickshaw pullers to comply and increase the burden on citizens. In short, the Council has never disregarded the difficulties of rickshaw owners. Looking at the Municipal Council's announcement of accepting the petitions of new rickshaw owners, a total of 4,893 new rickshaw owners have submitted petitions, requesting 47,580 public rickshaw licenses, all willing to comply with the new regulations. If the Council's new regulations cannot be implemented, how can these new rickshaw owners come to make this request? The Council has not yet determined the distribution of licenses but has prepared for it. Some applicants still need to be investigated, and once they have submitted their responses, the Vehicle Committee will proceed with the distribution. The licenses for August will be issued from the 7th to the 13th.</p>
<p>Public Association Opinion</p>
<p>After the Municipal Council held a meeting the day before yesterday, Director Zhong Sizeng instructed the representatives of the Rickshaw Trade Association to prepare minimum amendments to the new regulations to be presented for public discussion at the meeting at 10 AM on the 6th. It is now known that the Association has drafted seven items: (1) rickshaw rental issues; (2) rickshaw puller relief fund; (3) discussion of new rickshaw styles; (4) business protection (Items 1, 2, and 3 of the new regulations provide no protection for rickshaw owners' businesses); (5) rickshaw puller registration procedures; (6) deadline for rickshaw owners to obtain new licenses; (7) establishment of a rickshaw industry committee to assist in the implementation of the new regulations, etc.</p>
<p>Chinese Committee Conversation</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to improve the treatment and living conditions of rickshaw pullers in the special district, has specially drafted sixteen articles of a plan and is determined to implement them from August 1st. The rickshaw owners, however, believe that the content of the new regulations is too harsh and are also insisting on opposing them, so the August licenses cannot be obtained. According to custom, the license period for each quarter can only be extended by six days at the latest. After the deadline, continued business will not be allowed. Now, with only two days until the deadline, the rickshaw owners are quite anxious. It is likely that all rickshaws in the Public Concession will be suspended as a result, leading to a strike. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups are also paying close attention to this and discussing solutions to avoid a breakdown between the two parties. The Guowen News Agency reporter specially inquired about this matter with Mr. Wang of the Vehicle Affairs Committee, who provided a detailed explanation, which is recorded below. According to him, the Municipal Council began to improve the treatment and living conditions of rickshaw pullers last year and established the Vehicle Affairs Committee to conduct a thorough investigation of the situation of rickshaw pullers and the layers of exploitation by rickshaw owners. The draft plan was also announced in February of this year and has been in effect for half a year. It is quite difficult to modify the content of the new regulations, as the Municipal Council has long been determined on this issue and there is no room for further modification. As for the current shady practices of rickshaw pullers renting rickshaws from rickshaw owners, they are obvious to everyone, and public opinion is clear. It is said that the Municipal Council once convened rickshaw owners to modify the new regulations, which would be inconsistent and contradict the facts. Although there was a public discussion, there were no resolutions, and this committee did not receive any formal orders. The new regulations implemented by the Municipal Council are based on the committee's investigation report. Even if there are slight changes, the consent of this committee must be obtained first. The rickshaw owners have raised many arguments recently, which are unfounded and difficult to establish. Those who are knowledgeable will understand. As for the advance payment of one yuan and five jiao, the Municipal Council has not determined its use or prepared a budget. The purpose of the Municipal Council in collecting this fee is to force rickshaw owners to seek happiness for rickshaw pullers. All funds are directly withdrawn by the rickshaw owners. The intention of the Municipal Council is only to be in a supervisory position. Some people say that the Municipal Council seems to be too arbitrary and hasty. In fact, this is not the case. The content of the report was announced in February of this year, which is now half a year ago. How can it be said to be too hasty? However, we sincerely welcome all sectors to investigate the content of both parties in detail and make a fair judgment. If the measures of the Municipal Council are indeed flawed, they can be criticized, deliberated, and modified. If everyone believes that there are no mistakes, we will not be intimidated by any threats, even if a strike occurs. As for the Fa Hua licenses, they have already been obtained. This matter is not related to the Municipal Council and cannot be interfered with. If the old rickshaw owners insist on maintaining their views, the Municipal Council has also decided to issue licenses to those who are willing to accept the new regulations. According to statistics, the new rickshaw owners who have submitted petitions currently number 4,893. Although the distribution of licenses has not been determined, preparations have been made for the distribution. If this incident remains deadlocked, from August 7th, all certificates and licenses will be issued to the new rickshaw owners who have applied to take over the business.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Petition</p>
<p>The Shiye News Agency reports that since the Municipal Council announced the implementation of rickshaw puller registration, rickshaw pullers in the special district, believing that the restrictions are too harsh, have unanimously expressed their opposition. The resulting disputes are no less than those of the rickshaw owners. At 10 AM yesterday, rickshaw pullers in the city appointed Chen Guoliang, Xu Qingyu, Han Shiyao, Qian Youfu, Xu Zhaoyuan, Lu Shaode, Xu Lirong, Yao Shengting, Chen Zhigao, Liu Fushan, Zhou Chunhai, Feng Er, Huang Dechun, Zhu Yuzhi, Tian Shunqing, and more than twenty others as representatives of rickshaw pullers throughout the city. They went to the Municipal Council to petition Director Zhong Si, who was seen by He Deqiu of the Chinese Council. As the matter fell within the scope of the Vehicle Management Office, a special commissioner accompanied them to the Management Office. The Vehicle Affairs Committee was in a meeting at the time, so they appointed an officer named Yuan to receive them. Chen Guoliang and others stated that among the rickshaw puller representatives reported in the newspaper the day before yesterday, someone falsely claimed to be Xu Zhaoyuan and was listed as supporting the sixteen articles of the plan, but Xu Zhaoyuan himself had not heard about it and had already sent a letter to the newspapers to correct it. As for the various plans that the Municipal Council is now implementing to relieve rickshaw pullers, the rickshaw pullers are deeply grateful. However, of the sixteen articles discussed, the board of directors has resolved to retain the first three articles, and only thirteen articles are currently being implemented. All those posing as rickshaw puller representatives, such as Feng Guisheng, are actually He Wushan, who used to be a stallholder, also known as Songqing, using the alias Jia Rui. He is a speculator who falsely poses as a representative group, admitting everything, using the Municipal Council, and spreading rumors abroad, disregarding the livelihood of rickshaw pullers. When Guoliang and others were petitioning, Xu Zhaoyuan saw He Wushan come to the Management Office to inquire. When he saw Guoliang and others, he immediately fled. It is clear that he is a reactionary element who intends to disrupt. Today, Guoliang and others, entrusted by rickshaw pullers throughout the city, are requesting the following points from your office: (1) The rickshaw owners have now agreed to reduce the rickshaw rental to twelve jiao and donate one yuan per vehicle per month for rickshaw puller relief. The rickshaw pullers are satisfied with this and ask for a peaceful resolution to end the disputes and secure their livelihoods. (2) Please crack down on the police's random confiscation of licenses. (3) The local silver industry and rice merchants...</p>
<h3 id="e107">Jointly Purchase 160,000 Shi of Foreign Rice <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The cost, including tariffs, etc., is ten and a half yuan per 200 pounds</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that since the summer of this year, the weather has been arid and the price of rice has soared. The local rice industry once planned to purchase 500,000 shi of foreign rice to prepare for famine and to help suppress rice prices. However, after being unanimously opposed by various regions, a general meeting was convened to reconsider and cancel the plan. However, the atmosphere of ordering foreign rice has remained pervasive. According to a message from the rice industry yesterday, four local silver firms and six rice firms with strong capital from both the north and south markets have jointly purchased 160,000 shi of Saigon rice, which will be undertaken by the two British firms, Jardine Matheson and Daofu. The contract was signed the day before yesterday (the 3rd). Including import tariffs and transportation costs, the total cost is ten yuan and five jiao per 200 pounds, and each shi is 100 jin, which is equivalent to seven yuan and seven or eight jiao. The foreign rice will be ordered by the undertaking foreign firm to be shipped from the production area and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early September, ready to be sold when the market price rises.</p>
<p>Please revoke the order for rickshaw puller registration. If the plan must be implemented, then (A) stipulate a quota, (B) do not require a physical examination, (C) do not require a photograph, (D) allow free registration every day, (E) do not stipulate fares, (F) do not limit the number of passengers, (G) police officers should not interfere with soliciting business along the road, (4) allow 10,000 vehicles to be supplemented (there are currently 9,990 vehicles), and use the rental income of ten vehicles to help relieve rickshaw pullers. Officer Yuan expressed complete acceptance of the above four points and agreed to forward them to Mr. Massey, chairman of the Vehicle Affairs Committee, for consultation. The representatives were satisfied and then took their leave.</p>
<p>After the Reorganization of the Chinese Seamen's Union</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Shanghai Branch Was Reorganized Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Committee Member Huan Concurrently Serves as Chairman</p>
<p>Ma Zhongxian and Others Serve as Organizing Committee Members</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee changed to a chairman system, with Yang Hu appointed by the central government as chairman, it has actively promoted union affairs and spared no effort. All local branches previously had a standing committee system. Now that the headquarters system has changed, in order to strengthen the lower-level trade unions and improve work efficiency, it is necessary to reorganize each branch. Therefore, with Yang's approval from the central government, the organizational rules of each local branch were revised. Since Shanghai is the center of the national seafarers' gathering, the Shanghai branch has a very important responsibility. If the organization is not strengthened and a good reputation is not established, the future of maritime transport will be difficult to advance. Therefore, Yang spent a lot of consideration in selecting candidates for the reorganization. It is now known that yesterday, it was decided that Committee Member Huan would serve as the chairman of the Shanghai branch, and Zhang Yaoming, Lü Shuangxi, Si Shijian, Ma Zhongxian, Chen Songnian, and Situ Long would serve as members of the Shanghai branch. It was submitted to the third committee meeting for approval, and all nine former committee members, including Gao Yimou, were removed. It is reported that the newly appointed chairman, Wu Huan, is a key member of the headquarters committee. In the future, with his leadership, the Shanghai branch will become more sound and become a national model. It is also reported that the committee members have scheduled to attend the meeting today to take office.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mental Hospital has been in operation for more than a year and its medical services have developed. The original buildings in Ren'an Lane on Guling Road are not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, the first branch was specially added in the Chunjiang Villa on Kangnao Road. The buildings are tall, the air is sufficient, the location is quiet, and it is suitable for the recuperation of patients. It has been renovated and the equipment is complete and the rooms are clean. The Public Concession Municipal Council's Health Department, sending mental patients from various police stations within the concession for medical treatment, has achieved remarkable results. The other day, a special foreign officer was sent to inspect, accompanied by the two vice presidents of the hospital, Song and Zheng, to visit the rooms and inquire in detail. They were highly praised and promised to report to the medical authorities for approval.</p>

All berths of all classes have been sold out in advance.</p>
<p>For the Mistaken Arrest of the Family Members of Jin Yu</p>
<h3 id="e111">Detective Wang Changshan Has Been Dismissed <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Jin Yu, Zi Liren, has an office on Ningbo Road in the French Concession and lives at No. 39 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road. On the evening of the 27th of last month, at around 10 PM, Jin's wife, Wang, and others, due to the hot weather, hired a rickshaw to go to the rooftop of the Great World for cooling. However, when the rickshaw passed the entrance of the Empire Theater on Avenue Joffre, it was suddenly suspected by Detective Wang Changshan of the French Concession Flower Donation Department to be a prostitute. Without asking the reason, he took them to the Songshan Road police station. They were released after the police chief inquired. Later, after learning about it, Lawyer Jin believed that the detective should not have abused his power illegally, arrested and imprisoned innocent women, and obstructed their freedom. He immediately submitted a document to the French Consul General and the French Police Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to strictly investigate the matter, as reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the French Consul General, Mr. Meriel, sent a letter to Lawyer Jin the other day, stating that according to his letter of July 30, an investigation was conducted, and it was found that Wang Changshan did not act out of malice but was only a temporary misunderstanding. His attitude was inevitably crude. He apologizes for this regrettable misunderstanding and has dismissed Detective Wang. Lawyer Jin was satisfied after receiving the letter, and a disturbance was thus quelled.</p>

<p>Mr. Jiang Fuchen, a leader in the local Western clothing industry, is currently a supervisor of the Western Clothing Association and a member of the organizing committee of the North Changsheng Association. He has always been enthusiastic about social welfare. It has recently been heard that Mr. Jiang intends to withdraw from various community positions due to his business commitments. Yesterday, he submitted a document to the party and government organs to request resignation from the position of organizing committee member of the North Changsheng Association. His original document stated: "Presented for the matter of application. I, Fuchen, was appointed by your association's order No. 38 on January 21st as a member of the Shanghai North Changsheng Association Organizing Committee, etc. After receiving this, I complied and took office to carry out the organization. It could have been completed earlier, but because the organization section did not verify the old industry rules and roster, and the old industry rules and roster had already been investigated by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and found to have added names, the director of the organization section, Wang Jiliang, was ordered to submit the eight old industry rule books to the bureau for verification. Because the roster has not been compiled, the inaugural meeting is not convenient to convene, and even if it is convened, there is no way to elect the executive committee. In addition, Fuchen has been overwhelmed with private affairs recently and is unable to attend to the position of member of the Shanghai North Changsheng Association Organizing Committee. It is better to cede the position to a more capable person today than to delay it in the future. Therefore, I respectfully submit this document to your association for review and approval of my resignation, which is for the public good." However, the organizing committee has resolved at its fifteenth meeting to unanimously retain Mr. Jiang.</p>

<p>What is Feng Dengyun's Intent?</p>
<p>Feng Dengyun, a barber at No. 131, Taiyangmiao Road, Zhabei, took six copper coins at around 5 PM yesterday and went to the De Da Xiang cigarette shop next door, owned by Chen Peilin, to buy four "Golden Mouse" brand cigarettes. The shop said that each "Golden Mouse" cigarette cost sixteen cash, and he was still short four small coins, so they offered to give him another type of cigarette instead. Feng refused, leading to an argument and then a scuffle. Feng suffered a slight injury. Unable to vent his anger, he rushed back to the barbershop, grabbed his own razor, and slashed his head, chest, etc., repeatedly. He was immediately covered in blood. Later, he dragged Chen to the Taiyangmiao Police Station and then transferred to the Fourth District. He had six cuts on his head and five on his chest.</p>

<p>One Handgun, One Magazine</p>
<p>Three Suspects Arrested and Sent to the Bureau for Handling</p>
<p>Gu Liancheng, a squad leader of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team, and detective Shen Jinchu learned that Zhang Gengsheng from Fengxian and Zhang Jinxiang, a local, were arrested by Taicang detectives for committing a crime. They confessed to conspiring to rob the Ni Zhulou family in Qingyang Port, Fengxian, with weapons, and were sent to the county court for trial. The crime was confirmed, and they were sentenced to imprisonment and transferred to the Wuxian Prison to serve their sentences. After their release last year, they worked as tailors in the tailoring shop opened by Zhang Tao at No. 34, Dazhai, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, this April. Pan Shengyu, a colleague of Zhang Gengsheng, brought a handgun without bullets to Zhang's place, intending to collude in a robbery. Zhang reported that he hid the handgun, etc., to Detective Team Leader Lu Ying, who dispatched armed detectives Wu Kuisheng and others to cooperate with the police officers of the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District of the Municipal Police Bureau. At about 1 PM the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the tailoring shop and found a "44558" Colt Browning handgun under the pillow on the bed in the room. They also found an old magazine in the garbage pile next to Zhang Gengsheng's house. They arrested three suspects on the spot: Shen A'er, a peddler from Suzhou, Zhang Gengsheng, a tailor from Fengxian, and Zhang Jinxiang, a bookbinder from Shanghai, and took them and the evidence to the team for detention. Yesterday morning, Team Leader Lu summoned the case and, after interrogation, ordered that the three suspects, including Zhang, be sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for handling the case of private possession of firearms.</p>

<p>Landlord Company Orders Contract Signing</p>
<h3 id="e120">Residents of Xicheng Lane Petition for Relief <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 134 houses in Xicheng Lane on Ximen Road and Malang Road in this city, housing more than 2,000 residents. It is the property of Sun Chuanfang, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Allied Forces, and was managed by the Yi Pin Bank. A rental contract was in place, and the relationship between the landlord and tenants was harmonious. This year, Yi Yuan Company took over the management. Unexpectedly, within three months, the company ordered the tenants to sign a new contract. Because the content was harsh, it was not accepted. Unexpectedly, the company, regardless of the situation, hired a lawyer to sue in the Second Special District Court, issuing an order for immediate eviction. The lane submitted petitions to the Municipal Social Bureau and the Second Special District Local Court yesterday, requesting relief. The petition stated that the houses in Xicheng Lane on Sima Road and Malang Road were managed by the Yi Pin Bank. This year, the management was suddenly changed to the Yi Yuan Company. During the change, the Yi Yuan Company sent a letter to the tenants stating that the change in the name of Yi Yuan Company was only nominal and that nothing else had changed. Unexpectedly, within three months, the company ordered the tenants to sign a new contract. After reviewing the contents of the contract, the tenants found it too harsh and unacceptable and requested revisions. Unexpectedly, the company, regardless of the situation, hired lawyer Wu Zhenming to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court for refusal to sign the contract, involving as many as 36 households. The company claimed that if the tenants did not sign the new contract, they would be evicted so that the company could re-let the houses, increase the rent, and collect kickbacks. The residents, based on legal principles and human sentiment, made a clear defense to the court. The court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, but Yi Yuan Company continued to be litigious and filed an appeal. The residents believe that they rent houses to live in peace and that the company is now using the remaining power of the warlords to exert pressure and entangle them in lawsuits, causing them to live in unease. Moreover, according to Article 425 of the Civil Code, the lessee has the right to transfer a contract. The company is disregarding legal principles and relying on its power to bring lawsuits, causing the tenants to suffer unwarranted losses and inexplicable pain, with no way to appeal. Furthermore, the rent in Xicheng Lane was already increased by 10% in 1919. Now, at a time when business is declining and all industries are bankrupt, the residents are struggling to make a living, and such a large rent is unbearable. Therefore, various industries in the city have already reduced rents. The residents have organized the Xicheng Lane Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation to unanimously request a rent reduction to ease their burden. The residents are not making excessive demands, only requesting a 10% reduction to restore the rent to the level before 1919, which can be said to be justified. Therefore, we are specially submitting this petition to request your bureau to make a fair correction, and we earnestly request that the details be telegraphed to Mr. Sun Chuanfang, requesting that he notify the management office to approve the reduction and request the court to withdraw the lawsuit to avoid disputes and protect the safety of the tenants. We would be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau.</p>

<p>Covered in Blood North of Yangjiaqiao</p>
<p>On the Songhu Railway north of Yangjiaqiao in Zhabei, at about 9 PM the night before last, a pedestrian was walking along the tracks. A train was sounding its horn, but the person did not move aside and was run over by the wheels and split in two. The scene was gruesome. The police officer on duty at Post No. 7 of the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District of the Municipal Police Bureau saw it and reported the information to the chief, who reported it to the General Bureau for record.</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Industry</p>
<h3 id="e122">Continuing to Gather to Discuss the License Tax <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance transferred the tobacco and alcohol license tax in this city to the Municipal Finance Bureau, officials have been dispatched to investigate and rectify the situation. However, the registration procedures at the various tax collection offices are cumbersome, so it is feared that the deadline of August 7 will be difficult to meet. It is known that there are no fewer than several thousand tobacco and alcohol businesses in this city, and there are five or six thousand tobacco retailers. According to previous reports, only a thousand have applied for registration. It is heard that the various guilds of the industry, at the request of their members, believe that the increased amount of the license tax during this rectification is too heavy and is borne solely by the citizens of Shanghai. They intend to petition the Ministry of Finance to quickly improve the regulations so that both the treasury and the merchants can benefit. During this request period, penalties cannot be enforced. If they are determined and strict, the unrest may inevitably expand. The news from both sides has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that representatives from various guilds, including tobacco retailers, soy sauce and wine, Fen wine, soy sauce gardens, local yellow wine, Liang Shao, restaurants, Western cigarettes, dry tobacco, and tobacco leaves, after reading the responsible remarks published by the Finance Bureau, believe that they are disrespecting the industry and disregarding the last wishes of the Premier, harming people's livelihood, leading to public outrage. They have decided to hold a joint meeting of representatives from eleven guilds at 2 PM today at No. 487, opposite the Huacheng Tobacco Company on Ningbo Road, the tobacco retail market, to further address the responsible remarks of the Finance Bureau and to issue a joint declaration to make their position clear.</p>

<p>Further Hearing to Be Held After Witnesses Are Summoned</p>
<p>Jin Menggen, a local resident of Dajingeng, Zhoujiaqiao, in western Shanghai, was an inspector at a yarn factory and ran the Shunxingyuan teahouse in Zhoujiaqiao. He had one wife and two concubines. He first married Wang, but because she was infertile, he took Liu as a concubine, but she still did not have any children. Therefore, he took Bao as a second concubine, who bore him two sons, the elder five years old and the younger two years old. Jin and Wang Xingshan (also known as A'xin, the former head of the Zhoujiaqiao Security Corps, who served from 1913 to 1916) had a feud because they jointly opened the Yongle Society Tanhuang Theater. In the beginning, Wang Qian was the manager, but after a dispute, the management position was taken over by another shareholder, Gao Maodi. At 5:30 AM on June 11 of this year (the 30th day of the fourth lunar month), Jin carried a birdcage and walked out of his home, Shunxingyuan, in Zhoujiaqiao, to fly his bird. Unexpectedly, about forty storefronts away from his home, he was shot and killed by his enemy. The court sent officials to investigate and determine the cause of death, and the police arrested Wang Xingshan, who was suspected of being involved, and sent him to the local court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi opened the trial several times and prosecuted him for murder, requesting a public trial in the criminal court. Yesterday morning, Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the Third Court to try the case. The defendant, Wang Xingshan, hired three lawyers, Yang Zhihao, Wu Kaisheng, and Shun Hanli, to appear in court to defend him. The deceased's wife, Jin Wang, was ill and did not attend. The deceased's concubines, Jin Liu and Jin Bao, attended the court and hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to request a private prosecution. Witnesses Qian Er, Wang Bugao, Gao Tongsheng, and others were present. After the judge took the stand, he ordered Wang Xingshan, who was in custody, to be brought to the dock to testify. He was 52 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Zhoujiaqiao. He said that he did not go out on the morning of June 11. The judge asked if he had a "lao touzi" (a euphemism for a mentor or spiritual guide). He replied that he did not, but he had only taken Lu as his "xiansheng" (teacher) six years ago. The judge asked if there was a difference between "xiansheng" and "lao touzi." He replied that he did not know. The judge asked how many sworn brothers he had. He replied that he did not have any. The judge asked why he wanted to "bai xiansheng" (become a student/disciple). He replied that he opened a bathhouse and was afraid that someone would come to cause trouble. The judge asked how many years he had been running the bathhouse. He replied that it had been about three years. The judge asked if he had ever been the manager of the Yongle Society Tanhuang Theater. He replied that he had not. Then, Jin Liu, Jin Bao, and others requested that justice be done for their husband. Finally, after each witness testified, the judge said that it was necessary to summon more witnesses and scheduled another hearing. The defendant was taken back into custody.</p>

Discussion items: (1) The society should submit a report to the National Government, informing it of the Panchen Lama's appointment of a Dharma master to translate scriptures and how the society will proceed, and request an appropriation of recurring expenses and a meeting place to promote and translate the classics. In the past, during prosperous times, the state specially sent Xuanzang Dharma Master to West India to obtain scriptures, and Kumārajīva also came to reside in the Middle Kingdom and translated scriptures under imperial order. They were all given funds and support by the state, so they were able to spend years compiling voluminous books. This society was established according to the Panchen Lama's will, and although everything is in its initial stages and the foundation is not yet solid, it has great significance in terms of territory and religion. The government should actively promote it. (2) The sponsors of the society should separately be responsible for fundraising, which is currently underway. As soon as replies are received, a donation list will be made and they will be asked to donate. (3) Venerable elders from various mountains and Buddhist associations in various provinces, cities, and districts should be asked to solicit donations. (4) After the inaugural meeting is held, a donation team will be organized to raise funds.</p>

<p>Mr. Yuan Anda, residing at No. 3 East of Daoda Lane, Meibaige Road intersection, Aiwenyang Road, British Concession, is a well-known national doctor from Yangshou. He has extensively studied all Chinese medicine books and has accumulated decades of clinical experience, making his medical knowledge more and more miraculous and his diagnosis accurate. Because even patients from several counties away in his hometown would come from afar to seek treatment, his door was always bustling. Unable to bear the burden, he quietly moved to Shanghai. People in Shanghai who admired his name would seek treatment for difficult cases, and he would always bring them back to health. However, he still found it too troublesome, so he limited himself to prescribing a certain number of prescriptions each day and would not see any more patients after the limit was reached.

It is heard that in order to select talent, it will recruit twelve trainees within the next few days, assigning them to work in various departments. The minimum qualification is junior high school graduation. During the training period, a temporary monthly allowance of ten yuan will be given, along with free room and board. The benefits are probably unsurpassed except for the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China.

People in society, because of its high quality and low price, are happy to use it. In the past month, including both local and foreign sales, more than forty units have been sold. The company is almost unable to meet demand and is now strictly supervising the manufacturing plant to increase production to meet market needs.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinfeng Used Name to Run School</p>
<h3 id="e130">Fraudulent Land Acquisition Case Concluded on Appeal <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Trial Held Yesterday at the Jiangsu High Court, Verdict to Be Announced on the 8th of This Month</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that Zhang Jinfeng (also known as Ji Lan), a well-known wealthy man from Jiangwan, used his position as the Director of General Affairs of the All-China Athletic Federation in 1921 to falsely claim that he would establish a school and factory. He obtained approval from Feng Cheng, the magistrate of Baoshan County, to acquire more than 230 mu of civilian land at low prices in the "Yin Jiu" and "Yin Shi Yi" areas of Jiangwan. He then leased the land to the Japanese to be used as a volleyball field, but the school and factory were never established. It was also heard that he had sold the land to foreign merchants. The original landowners learned of this and submitted petitions to party and government agencies in 1927, requesting that he be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Taken into Custody and Sent to Court</p>
<p>At that time, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Political Council resolved to issue a warrant for his arrest and investigation, but Zhang was powerful and influential and remained at large. After the establishment of the municipal government, the case was handled by the municipal government. In October 1929, the municipal government announced that the land could not be bought or sold or mortgaged, and instructed the Land Bureau to announce the suspension of transfer registration. At the same time, Zhang was taken into custody and sent to court. Later, with the help of a certain important person, he was released on bail of 50,000 yuan, and the case was shelved for years until July 1930.</p>
<p>No Prosecution</p>
<p>After investigation, the Procuratorate of the Local Court decided not to prosecute. Subsequently, the municipal government, based on public opinion and facts, sent a letter to the court requesting reconsideration, but without result. In November of last year, the Local Court suddenly received an order from the Higher Court, forwarded from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating that the original decision was inappropriate and instructing that it be revoked. The court then conducted a re-investigation in accordance with legal procedures and decided to prosecute.</p>
<p>Surrendered and Taken into Custody</p>
<p>On the afternoon of April 16, Zhang himself, for some reason, went to the court with his lawyer and was taken into custody. On May 13, the court debate concluded and he was sentenced to five years in prison. The lawyer requested bail, but it was denied. Zhang was dissatisfied and appealed to the Higher Court.</p>
<p>Scheduled for Pronouncement</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date for the hearing of this case. The plaintiffs, the original landowners Zhong Dunyao, Hou Maomao, Shen Yueqing, and Li Baobao, as well as the defendant Zhang Jinfeng and lawyer Jiang Yiping and two others, were present. After the judges questioned them separately, the lawyers made their defense. The judges announced that the verdict would be announced on the 8th.</p>

<p>Giant Robbery Case Seven Years Ago</p>
<h3 id="e132">Accomplice Arrested <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Comprador Suspected of Being an Inside Informant</p>
<p>At Large for a Long Time, Recently Arrested</p>
<p>The Beilaiheng Foreign Firm, owned by a Spaniard, located at No. 320 Jiangxi Road, specializes in the business of pearl jewelry and gold watches, with a wide range of operations. At midnight on May 21, 1927, the safe in the foreign firm where jewelry was stored was suddenly pried open, and all the jewelry and 1,352 gold watches, worth 50,000 yuan, were stolen. The next morning, the foreign firm discovered the theft and reported it to the General Patrol Station, requesting an investigation. After a detailed investigation by the patrol station, two suspects, a Russian named Si Deluonai and a Cantonese named Li Yuhua, were arrested. A portion of the stolen goods, gold watches worth 5,000 yuan, were found. Li claimed to be Portuguese and had been naturalized as a Portuguese citizen, so the patrol station sent Li to the Portuguese Consulate, which transferred him to the Macau Consulate, where he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. The patrol station sent the Russian Si Deluo to the former Provisional Court, but before the case was concluded, the Russian committed suicide in the patrol station. However, Li's confession implicated the Chinese comprador of the foreign firm, a Cantonese named Chen Jiansheng, as an accomplice in the case. The patrol station also confirmed that Chen was indeed in a suspicious position. The foreign firm had four safes, large and small, and the key to the smaller safe was hidden in each safe, while the remaining safes contained jewelry. When the theft occurred that night, the thieves first managed to blow up the small safe to obtain the key, and then opened the large safes and took the important jewelry. The thieves were very familiar with the internal situation of the firm, so there must have been an inside informant. Therefore, the patrol station paid close attention to Chen Jiansheng and was about to arrest him.</p>
<p>Chinese Institute of Engineers</p>
<h3 id="e133">Building Materials Testing Laboratory <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The location is in the city center; the cornerstone laying ceremony was held this morning.</p>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers, in view of the fact that there is no dedicated testing facility for various materials in Chinese industry, which makes it impossible to assess the quality of products, and both production and sales are greatly affected, established the Architectural and Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory Committee in the spring of the 18th year. Shen Yi, Wang Boqiao, Xue Cixin, Xu Enzeng, and others were hired as members, and a base was purchased in Fenglin Bridge in the new western district of the city for future use. Subsequently, the board of directors of the committee decided to rebuild in the central urban area due to the remote location of Fenglin Bridge. Therefore, it also purchased four acres of land in the area from the municipal government as the site of the testing laboratory. The drawings of the laboratory building were designed by architect Dong Dayou. The entire building is divided into three parts: the middle two floors are for offices, and the east and west parts are for testing rooms, each with an area of sixty square meters. The structural form adopts the latest cubic style, decorated with Chinese ornaments. The walls are made of stone, and the overall appearance expresses simplicity and solidity. If it is not sufficient in the future, another floor can be added. The funds for this project were raised from various sources, and a large number of building materials were donated by domestic industrial circles, such as the Yanghui donated by Qixin Cement Company and Shanghai and China Cement Companies, tiles from Yizhong Machinery Company and Xingye Tile Company, famous stones from China Stone Company, facing bricks from Taishan Brick and Tile Company, wiring devices from Huatong and Huasheng Electric Appliance Factories, wood from fans and motor Jiu Ji Timber Company, steel windows from Dongfang and Shanghai Steel Window Companies, terrazzo from Huachang Firm, bricks from Dazhong Tile Company, gravel from Yongda Stone Rolling Factory, and lime from Jinfeng Mineral Ash Factory, etc. The initial building of the testing laboratory has been contracted by Zhang Yutai Architectural Firm for 32,500 yuan, and the cornerstone laying ceremony will be held at 9:30 this morning (5th). After its completion in the future, the scope of testing and research will temporarily focus on the four industrial materials of machinery, chemistry, electrical engineering, and physics. However, the cost is huge, and it is hoped that all sectors will actively contribute to its completion. Regarding the testing application machines, it is also heard that the Swiss Amsler Testing Machine Company has donated a 3,000 kg large impact testing machine free of charge. It is also hoped that various manufacturers will donate as much as possible, so as to create a great testing institution and make the greatest contribution to the national industry and commerce.</p>
<p>When the arrest was about to take place, Chen learned about it and fled without a trace. He then petitioned the court to issue a warrant for his arrest, which has been ongoing for seven years without success. It was not until 12 noon the day before yesterday that Chief Detective Che Xueceng of the General Patrol Room learned that Chen had come to Shanghai from Suzhou and was hiding in Yule Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. He went to arrest him and met Chen by chance at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Jiangxi Road. He was arrested and taken to the patrol room for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division 1, where the patrol room lawyer Gan Jingxian prosecuted the defendant Chen Jiansheng for theft in accordance with Article 338 of the Criminal Law. Chen Jiansheng was a comprador in the Belle Hingham Foreign Firm, but he had resigned two months before the theft occurred and went to work for Baosheng Foreign Firm. However, ten days before the incident, he went to Suzhou to recuperate due to illness. He denied colluding with the theft, saying that it was Li Yuhua's false accusation, because Li and I were fellow villagers. Before, he colluded with a Westerner to falsely sign my name in an attempt to fraudulently claim 14,400 yuan, resulting in a grudge, etc. After reviewing the confession, Judge Qian Hongye ordered the case to be adjourned for seven days for further questioning, and the defendant was allowed to be released on bail for 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Using Bounced Checks as a Cover</p>
<p>Fourteen Victims</p>
<p>| Suspects Arrested in Shanghai and Hangzhou |</p>
<p>Baoyuanshang Department Store, located at No. 2 Ruyili, Lan Weiai Road, French Concession, was opened on May 24 this year. Shareholder and manager Zhou Ruiqing obtained two shares, Qiu Zhenhua, manager of Huadong Department Store of Shanghai Military Camp, obtained one share, the owner of Gu Tianbao Silver Shop on Gordon Road obtained one share, Wang Xuelin from Tongzhou (formerly a detective in the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau) obtained one share, and Chen Ziming obtained one share, totaling seven shares. However, the shareholders did not contribute capital. It was actually a fictitious and slippery company that defrauded goods from various shops and factories in Shanghai. Chen Ziming established Yichangshun United Company in Hangzhou. Their method of defrauding goods in Shanghai was to have Gu Tianbao Silver Shop and Huadong Department Store issue bounced checks to various customers to defraud goods, which were transported to Hangzhou at night for sale and profit sharing. On the 17th of last month, because the issued checks were due, the customers could not collect the money. At the same time, Baoyuanshang went bankrupt, and Zhou and others fled without a trace. The next day, creditors Shenkang Firm, Guosheng Industrial Raw Materials Firm, Mingguang Company, Xiangfu Factory, Mingfeng Firm, Dehua Firm, Xie Xing Sports Equipment Firm, Rimingxin Firm, Detai Xin Firm, Daming Socks Factory, Minsheng Trading Company, and other fourteen companies discovered that the goods defrauded from each company were worth about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Therefore, Yu Boji, representative of Shenkang Firm, and others reported to the French patrol room. Detectives Zhou Bingcheng and others successively arrested Baoyuanshang shareholders Wang Xuelin, Chen Ziming, and clerk Gao Depei in Shanghai and Hangzhou. They were first sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution in the primary court and transferred to the local court for trial. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian interrogated them in Criminal Division 1. The patrol room lawyer Yao Zhaodi changed the charge to fraud in accordance with Article 363 of the Criminal Law. Wang Xuelin and Chen Ziming admitted to establishing a fictitious company to defraud goods. Gao Depei confessed to being a street vendor and denied colluding with the fraud. The plaintiffs also hired lawyers to request incidental civil suits to recover the defrauded money. The defendants also hired lawyers to defend themselves. After reviewing the confession in court, the debate was declared over, and the judgment was scheduled for the 9th of this month. Wang and Chen were remanded in custody, and Gao Depei was allowed to be released on bail pending a decision.</p>

<p>Judge Advises Reconciliation</p>
<p>The Case Still Needs Investigation</p>
<p>Cheng Yuangao, a student at Zhengfeng College and a native of Anhui County, is 22 years old. His wife, Yu Dihua, is from Beijing and Anhui and lives with Cheng at No. 8 Guirenli, Maigen Road. Cheng's mother, Huang, suddenly complained to the Xinzha Patrol Room that her son and daughter-in-law had assaulted her at home at 10 pm on the 26th of last month and injured her, requesting detention and investigation. The head of the patrol dispatched detectives to send her to Guangren Hospital for examination, where it was found that only the index finger of her right hand was slightly broken. The patrol room then filed a public prosecution in the First Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Criminal Division 2 to summon Cheng Yuangao and Yu Dihua, accompanied by defense lawyer Sun Zuji, to court. The patrol room lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that, according to the plaintiff's complaint, on the 26th, the door was closed when she went out, preventing the defendant from entering, which led to the assault. The patrol room is now prosecuting in accordance with Articles 293, 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and presented the injury report to the court. Huang from Cheng continued to claim that Cheng Yuangao was adopted by me at the age of one, and I married him at the age of eighteen. Now that he has grown up, he hates me and beats me under the pretext, and should be punished according to the law. Questioning Cheng Yuangao, he confessed that he was not at home that day, but was talking with Zheng Qiao, the owner of Zheng Qiao Long Foreign Goods Store on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, with a letter from Zheng as proof, so I really didn't know anything. Lawyer Sun immediately rose and said that the plaintiff in this case had been involved in a lawsuit with his clansman Cheng Shi for the inheritance for seven or eight years. The plaintiff won the final victory, and Zheng Shuming (i.e., Zheng Yangqiao's brother) has a special relationship with Cheng Huang. Food and accommodation are provided by him. Now the plaintiff listens to Zheng's slander and intends to subject the defendant to criminal punishment in order to enjoy the huge inheritance alone. Therefore, the inside story of this case is extremely tortuous. If the plaintiff does not withdraw the case, the defendant will declare everything to the court. Questioning Yu Dihua, she confessed that on the 26th of last month, when my mother-in-law was not at home, I went out shopping. Unexpectedly, Zheng Shuming closed the door, preventing me from entering. I argued with him because he had nothing to do with Cheng and was always bored at home. He had no right to stop me from entering. At that time, the plaintiff also participated, but there was no assault. The court believed that the two parties in this case were mother and son and should not confront each other in court. Therefore, it advised the plaintiff to consider carefully, be calm, and not want to go to extremes. On the one hand, it also warned the defendant as a junior, no matter what the facts are, he must please his parents. Now that he is involved in a lawsuit, he should apologize to the plaintiff so that the relationship can be restored. Moreover, this case still needs to be investigated, and ordered a new hearing and ordered the two parties to try to reconcile.</p>

It has drafted a simple regulation and submitted it to the Road Police Administration for approval to recruit fifty reserve police officers, conduct examinations, and grant reserve qualifications in order to fill vacancies when they occur.

<p>Soon to Open to Traffic to Xin Chang</p>
<p>Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Co., Ltd. has been established for ten years. Initially, it used buses to transport passengers on Meixie Road. The planned routes are from Pudong Zhoujiadu, Yangsizhen, Sanlintangzhen, Tianfuxiang, Baiqu, Zhoupu, Xinchang, Datuanzhen, and eight locations. Due to insufficient funds at the beginning, it has not yet reached Datuan. The general manager of the company, Mu Shuzai, has repeatedly planned to build small train heads and rebuild tracks abroad five years ago to implement the change to small trains. Since the extension to Zhoupuzhen, the number of passengers has increased year by year. According to the current business, the annual income from ticket prices is more than 200,000 yuan. In recent years, the shareholders have also received official profits. Currently, it is about to open to traffic to Xinchang, and the road construction project has been completed. As long as the bridge project is completed, it will be able to open to traffic. However, the old ticket office in Zhoujiadu was not far from the Huangpu Bund when it was first built. Currently, the Pudong Bund Wharf has grown out of a half-mile road compared to when the old ticket office was built. Therefore, the company must build another ticket office near the Pudong Bund Wharf to facilitate passengers. It has now started construction of a new foreign-style ticket office. Once the work is completed, the old ticket office will be moved to the new ticket office to facilitate passengers to land after crossing the river and take the bus.</p>

<p>A Letter to the Ministry of Justice and Administration for Remedy</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association had previously investigated the case of Zhang Aizhen, a dancer residing at No. 6 Huaiderli, Back Road, assaulting the maid Xiaobao, together with the Xinzha Patrol Room. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Public Works Bureau filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court. Subsequently, Zhang Aizhen admitted in court that she had beaten her. Judge Wu Tingqi questioned the victim according to Article 293 of the Criminal Law for minor injury, and the court ruled not to prosecute, and Xiaobao was handed over to Zhang Aizhen to take back. It was reported earlier in this newspaper that the association believes that the victim Xiaobao is only six years old, and whether she has the ability to express her wishes is still a question. Even if she does, it cannot be used as a basis for judgment. Moreover, where are Xiaobao's biological parents, it is impossible to find out. Even if they are found, they may give up their right to sue on her behalf due to emotions and difficulties. In order to thoroughly protect the happiness of children and maintain humanity, the ruling in this case seems to be inappropriate in terms of law and human sentiment. Therefore, it yesterday listed the facts and opinions and sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice and Administration to request a remedy so that the victimized child can enjoy legal benefits and seek a definite legal guarantee for general children.</p>

<h3 id="e147">What is an International Issue? <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>丨丨 Answer to Mr. Gu Qianli</p>
<p>(1) The World is Humanity's Stage</p>
<p>What is an international issue? Before answering this question, it is necessary to first address what our world is. International issues occur within this world and are the main performances on this "world" stage. Therefore, before discussing the play, it is necessary to explain the stage.</p>
<p>The world, as commonly referred to, is the Earth, with a diameter of approximately 3,240 miles and an area of approximately 33 million miles. Land accounts for 29.2% of it, and oceans account for 77%. It is the home of all living things and the grand stage for humanity.</p>
<p>On this sphere, except for Antarctica's 14 million square kilometers and the Arctic's 2 million square kilometers, there are probably humans everywhere. The total human population is now approximately 1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Who built this stage? It was the great Mr. Nature. It existed before humans arrived in the world. Its history is too long, and we will not delve into it for now. But when did humans arrive on this stage? It is a long story. We know that they have been putting on "decent" plays on this stage for six or seven thousand years. Before that, for about 500,000 to 1 million years, their footprints were indeed on this stage, playing a more advanced role than their cousins丨丨apes丨丨. However, these old accounts cannot be detailed in this book.</p>
<p>Human understanding of this stage has undoubtedly gone through a long process. Not to mention that the world recognized by humans six or seven thousand years ago is not the world of today, even the world recognized by Chinese people eighty or ninety years ago is not the world of today. In the past, the world stage was obstructed by the stage equipment of oceans, mountains, rivers, and deserts. Humans were limited by nature, living in small environments in groups, with little communication between groups. Therefore, they each recognized that small world as the world, not knowing that the world they recognized was just a fragment of the whole, and that there were other brothers living like them beyond.

<p>Today's Tianjin-Shanghai tennis match was held on time at 3:00 PM at the British tennis court. The audience was still over a thousand people. First up was the second doubles match between Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia against Kuwahara and David. Lin and Zheng coordinated well, taking the advantage from the start. Baohua's backhand smashes and Zhaojia's interceptions each displayed their strengths, making it impossible for David and Kuwahara to retaliate. They won the first set 6-0. This set was won very easily. In the second set, Kuwahara and David tried their best to counterattack, but they were contained by Xiao Zheng's interceptions. The outcome of the third set was already decided. David's smashes went out of bounds, making Kuwahara helpless and negatively impacted. They both failed 6-4. Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia (Shanghai) 6-0, 6-4, 6-4, Kuwahara and David (Tianjin).</p>

<p>Next was the third singles match. Xia Guanfu entered the court with great momentum, competing with Carlsen for victory. In the second set, Xia took the advantage with effective swings. The third set was crucial for the outcome. Carlsen used a calm demeanor, and his tactics were enough to overcome the strong opponent. By the fourth set, the outcome was no longer in question. Carlsen played with even more ease, but Xia Guanfu was already exhausted, and thus failed in succession.</p>
<p>Carlsen (Shanghai) 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, Xia Guanfu (Tianjin)</p>

<p>Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, who returned to Hong Kong from Jiangxi, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (3rd) with her parents, sisters, and brothers, a total of five people, staying at the New Asia Hotel. Due to travel fatigue, they stayed at the New Asia to rest all day the day before yesterday.

Yesterday (4th) afternoon, she went to perform at the invitation of the Pootung Conservancy Bureau, followed by a tea party at the Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association, and a dinner party hosted by her father's old friend, Yang Meinan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Performance at the Pootung Conservancy Bureau: Around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Sports Association of the Zhoujiazui Island Pootung Conservancy Bureau, after obtaining the consent of Ms. Yang Xiuqiong in advance, went to a tea party and performance. At that time, the association sent a car to pick them up. Ms. Yang went with her parents and two sisters. Director Teng of the association warmly welcomed them and gave a freestyle performance.</p>

The association had made some preparations in advance, hanging a white banner that read "Welcome Ms. Yang Xiuqiong" above the garden gate. Around the garden, many small banners with welcome messages were hung, fluttering in the wind, with red and green reflecting each other, creating a unique atmosphere.

<p>[Photograph: Tang Haian Delivering a Welcome Speech (Photo by Ye Changlie)]</p>
<p>Tang Haian's Welcome Speech: At the beginning of the tea party, Tang Haian first introduced Ms. Yang's father, Yang Zhunan, the director of the swimming department of the Hong Kong South China Athletic Association, and the Yang sisters, and delivered a welcome speech. He briefly stated that the association welcomed Ms. Yang because she had won the women's swimming championship at the Far Eastern Games for the country and had come north to participate in swimming performances in Jiangxi despite the summer heat. Her fearless spirit is admirable, and it has awakened the people of the country to the importance of sports. He hopes that Ms. Yang will continue to work hard in sports with her diligent spirit in the future.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong's Reply: After Tang finished his speech, Yang stood up to reply, briefly stating that Xiuqiong was fortunate to win the championship at the Far Eastern Games due to luck. Thanks to the encouragement of all sectors, she will be more motivated in the future. At the same time, there will be more rising stars in the swimming world who will surpass Xiuqiong in the future.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests from All Circles: Cui Pinxi, Weng Ziguang, Ma Chonggan, Fei Shunyuan, Lu Lihua, Zheng Xingpu, and many others also gave congratulatory speeches. During the event, the Diligence Bookstore distributed the "Diligence Sports Monthly," and the Huaan Publishing House distributed the "Huamei Monthly." Ms. Yang praised the "Diligence Monthly." After the meeting, photos were taken to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Gaoqiao Performance: After the tea party, Yang Xiuqiong took a car with her parents, sisters, and brothers to the dinner hosted by Mr. Yang Meinan of the Taikoo Company. When getting into the car, a reporter from the New Voice Society asked if she would go to Gaoqiao for a performance tomorrow. She replied that she had nothing else to do, but was waiting for invitations from various sports and swimming organizations in Shanghai. It might be too late on Sunday (5th) because various organizations had firmly scheduled banquets. At the latest, the performance would be on Monday (6th), and the time would be in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Joint Welcome by Three Organizations: Shanghai Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, the Chinese Swimming Research Association, and the Three Wheels Brand Linhua Woolen Mill jointly welcomed Ms. Yang Xiuqiong. The original plan was to go to the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach for a performance at 9:00 AM today, but because various organizations in the city had scheduled banquets for Ms. Yang today, it was decided to postpone the performance to Gaoqiao for one day, scheduled for tomorrow, the 6th, at 1:00 PM. They will take a ferry across the river from the Bund bronze statue pier on Nanjing Road and then take a car to the Gaoqiao Bathing Beach. The Municipal Ferry Bureau, fearing congestion, will provide eight ferries to shuttle back and forth on the Huangpu River. From 3:00 PM to 6:30 PM, Ms. Yang Xiuqiong and Ms. Yang Xiuzhen, together with Yang Zhunan and Yang Changhua, will perform various swimming techniques. Swimming experts from Shanghai, Yu Binqi, Li Rixin, Zhang Yunqi, Bao Lengxue, Xu Zhongqi, Zhang Jiazhen, and others will also participate in swimming to add to the fun. At 7:00 PM, Ms. Yang and her family will be hosted at a banquet at the Gaoqiao Seaside Garden Hotel to celebrate. In order to welcome people from the sports, arts, and women's circles in the city, the three organizations have set up a quota of 100 participants. Anyone who wishes to join the swimming banquet should register at the Chinese Swimming Association, No. 115 Hankou Road, before 3:30 PM today and pay a participation fee of 3 yuan (including ferry, car, and meal fees). The association will take care of everything.</p>
<p>Performance at the YMCA Today: The Shanghai YMCA was the earliest to promote swimming, with a history of over twenty years. Many swimming talents at sea come from the association. This summer, it has been opened to allow women to have the opportunity to practice, which has been praised by people from all walks of life. This time, because Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, a famous female swimmer from our country, passed through Shanghai from Jiangxi on her way back to Hong Kong, she was specially invited to perform various swimming techniques at the association's swimming pool on Sichuan Road at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Ms. Yang agreed because the association's purpose of promoting swimming was the same. It is commendable that Ms. Yang has made a long journey to Jiangxi this time, bearing a major mission. On the one hand, she has revealed that the physical fitness of our country's women is not inferior to that of any other country, so Ms. Yang has been able to produce excellent results. On the other hand, she has aroused great interest among people in society in swimming. This is truly beneficial to the promotion of sports in our country. It is heard that the performance today does not sell tickets and is only limited to adult members of the association and members of the women's fitness group. They must present their credentials at the association's office from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM today to receive admission tickets (limited to 300 tickets). In addition to the Yang sisters performing various techniques, Ms. Yang and her father, Mr. Yang Guinan, will give speeches.</p>

<p>(Reuters, London, 4th) He Aiying, an English-Chinese girl, won the women's championship for those under 16 at the Queen's Tennis Club here today. Ms. He is only thirteen years old, making her victory even more remarkable, as some other players were just under the age limit of 16. It is also worth mentioning that Ms. He only lost three games in the semi-finals. According to tennis experts, Ms. He has a bright future and will certainly occupy a leading position in the world of women's tennis.</p>
<p>National Sports Association</p>
<h3 id="e154">Headquarters Temporarily Not Moving to Beijing <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Only Informal Talks Held in the Board of Directors Meeting</p>
<p>(Correspondence from Nanjing) The issue of relocating the headquarters of the All-China Athletic Federation was only discussed informally in the board of directors meeting on the 3rd and was not formally raised. It is speculated that the move will be postponed for the time being, as the association is focused on sports itself, and whether it is in Shanghai or Beijing, the work of the association is the same. If it is for external international relations, it seems more convenient in Shanghai. Also, in terms of funding, the income and expenditure can be adjusted in Shanghai due to ticket sales. Moving to Beijing would not guarantee funding and would be affected. Therefore, this issue is not being discussed at this time.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Director Pan Speaks on Vocational Education <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Broadcasted on the Greater China Radio Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau broadcasted on the Greater China Radio yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. Director Pan spoke on vocational education. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Vocational education, through the promotion and efforts of various parties, seems to have a flourishing phenomenon at present. However, what exactly is vocational education? The general public is still unclear about it. If I still want to answer this question, I must first know what education is and what a vocation is. Education, I can still say, is the superstructure of society. It changes with changes in the social environment and economic conditions. Its task must be to meet the requirements of the times and complete the mission of the times, and to cultivate the younger generation to continue the affairs of the previous era. Therefore, the content, purpose, and form of education are different in each era. As for the word "vocation," according to the usage in the "Historical Records" cited in the "Ciyuan," a vocation is something that should be done within one's duty. According to the Webster's Dictionary, it can be translated as "any service rendered to society, whether directly or indirectly increasing productivity, is called a vocation."</p>
<p>Now that we have clarified the explanations of education and vocation, then what is vocational education? It is very easy to solve. We can say that vocational education is using educational methods to enable everyone to obtain appropriate vocations, so as to become sound members of society. Its purpose is to transform the unemployed and unemployed into employed, to consolidate and improve the status of the employed, and to increase productivity for the country and society. Currently, many people do not clearly analyze the factors for the success of vocational education and think that technical education is vocational education, but it is only teaching techniques related to various crafts. In fact, this is not the case. Skill is certainly one of the main elements of the success of vocational education, but in addition to this, there must be a very sufficient basic common sense. At the same time, in addition to general knowledge and specialized skills, there must also be a considerable character. The so-called technical education can only increase a little productive capacity, but it cannot guarantee the fulfillment of vocational life. If we can only produce but do not have the temperament, character, and moral concepts to coordinate and guide, then that person is equal to a machine. Therefore, technology is only a part of vocational education, and not the entire vocational education. This is a point that deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Since the explanation of vocational education is as described above, then its origin must also be briefly studied. The origin of vocational education, in a broad sense, can be said to have originated when humans had vocations. When there are vocations, people must be taught to continue and pass on from generation to generation. However, the source of the current so-called vocational education is as follows: (1) Artization of curriculum content. In the mid-seventeenth century, famous educators in Europe, such as Locke and Comenius, advocated that education should not focus on textbooks, but should focus on practice. Therefore, they advocated sensory training. When it came to Rousseau, he advocated that physical activity should not only strengthen the body, but also make the senses sensitive and the hands and brain work together. In "Emile," he advocated using the method of investigating industry and commerce to enable children to understand the actual situation of society, and children should practice woodworking in families and schools. When it came to Pestalozzi, he put it into practice, which can be regarded as the first experiment in the artization of curriculum content. Later, Fellenberg and Froebel continued, and it gradually became popular in the nineteenth century, especially in Northern European countries, such as the work training in Russia and the so-called technical system in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. (2) Vocationization of school education. Because recent school graduates or dropouts have no skills to make a living when they go to society, there is a slogan that "graduation is unemployment." As a result, they have become high-level idlers. Therefore, educators have to find ways to remedy this, and they believe that the only remedy is to set up vocational courses in schools to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>The prevalence of vocationalization in Western schools is attributed to the Morrill Act in the United States. The motion of this act was because Professor Durrell proposed to allocate government land to various states as funding for establishing industrial schools. It was signed by Lincoln in 1862. Since then, vocational schools in the United States have flourished. Other countries, such as Japan, have followed the example of the United States, and China has followed the example of Japan. Recently, it has been learning from European and American countries, and everything is being actively implemented.</p>
<p>There are three main reasons why vocational education has gradually become consistent until recently, and it has a widespread trend in Europe and the United States. In China, although various parties have made efforts to promote it, it seems to have a flourishing atmosphere, but there are still many difficulties. (1) Outdated concepts, (2) difficulties for students in enrollment and employment, (3) social constraints, etc. If the above-mentioned difficulties cannot be resolved, then vocational education will be difficult to popularize.</p>

<p>Financial Rumors of US Monetary Inflation Emerge Again</p>
<h3 id="e174">Spot Gold Falls Another 3.7 Yuan <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>After a slight firming in the previous period, the gold market unexpectedly saw the overseas silver market and exchange rates continue to rise yesterday, then decline. Sentiment was still good, and short sellers continued to cover, while hedgers also bought. The mid-session situation was particularly firm, but because the rise lacked momentum, there were still sellers at noon. Upon investigation, at the start of the morning, although overseas silver and British silver shrank, observation of the spot market showed that they were still rising. In addition, US silver continued to rise, and forward silver prices rose again by 8 hao to 2 li, with March and May being flat. London gold shrank by half a penny, exchange rates rose again, US cotton fell by 12 pounds, US wheat shrank by 200, and stocks also fell slightly. Off-exchange trading opened and immediately fell back to 72.3 yuan. Fuyu was sold off heavily and was weak. After the opening, buying momentum continued as people took advantage of the low prices. It was learned in advance that the HSBC bank's exchange rates for British and American currencies had not changed. For a time, demand exceeded supply and prices rose. However, the banks' appetite was uncertain, and sellers were also active, so prices fell back. Guangbang continued to buy US dollars in the spot market, and Guangbang resumed buying. The futures gold market was still stable. In addition, Sassoon briefly hedged November US dollars at 625 and prices rose. However, sentiment was still difficult to turn bullish, and Chinese merchants continued to sell US dollars. The banks' appetite was uneven, and they were still weak as they sold near-term contracts. Large clients were still maintaining their positions, and short-selling power was lacking. After the low, prices were still able to recover. In the end, reports from abroad that rumors of monetary inflation were rampant in the United States, and unfavorable rumors that silver prices would continue to rise, prompted many to go short, and the underlying trend was still weak. At noon, because large clients had no buying appetite, there was an image of supply exceeding demand, so the result was difficult to revive. In addition, the banks were closed on Monday, and the gold market was also closed, so many were forced to close their positions. Trading was still active in the morning, and the market was quite flat. The number of chips was still increasing. The spot market was sluggish, and the swap premium rose to more than one yuan. After the morning market was recorded,</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 971.9 yuan, down 4.7 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 2 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with a selling price of 1 shilling 4 pence 3125 for the near term and 34.25 yuan for the US dollar. Citibank bought November US dollars at 6875.

After the opening, it seemed to ease. After entering the market, HSBC's listed price was announced, unchanged. The Guangdong banks worked hard to support and gradually tightened, but the Ningbo banks and large northern banks still stuffed the market, the process being uncertain. However, because Sassoon was still supporting, the situation hovered. When the Chinese merchants still had selling pressure, the result was once again easing. By the noon close, the near-term selling price for British pounds was 1 shilling 4 pence 0.3125; US dollars at 34.25 yuan (or slightly easier), compared to the previous closing, British pounds flat and US dollars easing by 0.0625.

<h3 id="e176">Silver and Money Trades Longing for Activity After Prolonged Quiet <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>According to past years, during this lean season, there was no possibility of development in the silver and money trades. However, this year, the silver and money trades are very different, often running contrary to precedent, so there are often abnormal developments. Although the northern and southern provinces are suffering from both floods and droughts, the various merchant guilds are engaging in activity at this time, causing the silver and money trades to invisibly show signs of activity. Yesterday, the interbank call loan rate remained at 7%, the same in the morning and afternoon. However, there was a market rate of 2% for drawing funds and adding water. The trading volume for call loans was over 3.9 million in the morning session and over 300,000 in the afternoon session. The trading volume in the small general exchange was over 200,000. The total banknotes collected and issued was over 1.4 million. The total silver collateral loan transactions, including redemption and new loans, was over 1.6 million. Funds from out-of-town sources amounted to 200,000, while outflow of funds was 150,000. Bank receipts and payments: foreign banks' receipts and payments of bills amounted to over 1.7 million, various loan collateral and miscellaneous receipts and payments amounted to over 2.9 million, telegraphic transfer funds amounted to over 900,000, and withdrawals from warehouses amounted to 300,000. Chinese banks' receipts and payments of bills amounted to over 2 million, customs duties amounted to over 400,000, various loan collateral and miscellaneous receipts and payments amounted to over 3.4 million, and withdrawals from warehouses amounted to 200,000.

Furthermore, the total exchange volume of the local clearing house was 7,554,303.8 silver dollars, including 2,730,566.22 silver dollars and 4,823,737.58 silver dollars in exchange drafts.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Minimal Fluctuations in Subsidiary Currency <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to lack of trading, Jiangnan small silver coins fell by one yuan at the opening price in the morning market, to 836 yuan. There were also no transactions in the afternoon market, so the price remained unchanged, still listed at the original price. Guangdong small silver coins opened slightly better at 729.5 yuan in the morning market, changing slightly to 728.5 yuan in the afternoon market. As a result, it fell slightly by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions were made in 45,000 dimes in the morning market and 15,000 dimes in the afternoon market. Copper coins were slightly short, at 331,500 cash, with the transaction price at 8,000 silver dollars, equivalent to 26,520 strings of cash.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e178">Securities Market Sees Another Rebound <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to the lack of hindrance from the Fujian incident, selling of the No. 4 stock had become scarce, and after several days of suppression, there was a slight release. However, confidence had not yet returned, and sellers remained eager to sell, with stocks like No. 11, No. 50, and No. 56 being heavily sold. The trend, due to uncertainty, may return to fluctuation. Yesterday's developments saw the opening for Troop Reduction and Disbandment stock slightly better but not very strong, and the middle session was generally flat. The Consolidated Tax stock had experienced a significant drop the previous day, so its rebound was particularly strong, rising sharply by one yuan. The Whole Six stock, because the previous day had been fairly good by five cents, saw a very slight rebound, with the two somewhat balancing each other out, showing signs of gradually fluctuating. The second session was flat and firm, slightly better by five cents, one dime to three dimes. The market closing prices showed an increase ranging from two or three dimes to one yuan plus change. The total transaction volume was estimated to be 15,230,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from the Sino-American Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 3rd), the New York Stock Exchange market was unusually dull with little fluctuation. Gold and silver stocks fell slightly. Foreigners believe that the US issuance of silver certificates contains inflationary significance, so the US dollar in the international foreign exchange market fell sharply. However, people in New York are waiting for developments and will not make various explanations for the time being. The small exchange and bond market also lacked change. US public bonds showed an easing tendency. In Chicago, although the news of the wheat harvest was beneficial to the bulls, it still fell due to profit-taking. Corn rose due to news of a hopeless harvest in Missouri. The total daily transaction volume was 460,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Guangdong Guild Already Active</p>
<p>The yarn market declined slightly due to the drop in imported cotton. Some bulls took profits, and the trading floor relaxed. However, spot yarn sales remained brisk, and the Guangdong guild also opened to buying, so the spot yarn market situation continued to be good, and the new selling trend was also curbed, so the scope of market fluctuations was unusually small. Observing the current market situation, advances and retreats are between two and three yuan, and there may be a period of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Slightly Drops Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of the branded yarn market in the morning saw a decline in American cotton, leading to scattered sentiment. Furthermore, the closing settlement of the previous day showed a bleak situation, with some profit-taking bulls closing out positions, slightly easing the floor. However, the decline was still moderate, as spot yarn sales were good, so the new selling trend was not strong. Each month fell by 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 yuan. The transaction volume was statistically 12,800 bales. The sales volume showed Tongji selling 350 bales, Suilong 550 bales, Zhenda 300 bales, Yuande 400 bales, Renfeng 800 bales, Yuanyi 600 bales, and Xiesheng 500 bales. The purchases volume showed Xinchang buying 300 bales, Yuanda 350 bales, Taixing 550 bales, Hengde 700 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, and Runkang 750 bales.

<p>The cotton market is flat and tired, with an extremely quiet situation. American cotton turned down, causing people's hearts to be weakened. However, a certain cotton firm came back to buy and speculate, and has already purchased as many as 2-30,000 bales, slightly tightening the floor. Manufacturers, seeing that yarn sales were good, still had no intention of entering the market, and it was difficult to raise prices. Since factory demand has been disappointed, we will wait for the publication of the American cotton estimates before deciding the outcome.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Bulls Close Out Positions</p>
<p>The opening of the branded cotton market in the morning saw a drop of 10 to 14 points in American cotton. Sellers in the market were not strong, and the near months were slightly tight. However, the auctions of distant months were flat. The Duo Chang Company had a large number of profit-taking bulls close out positions in the second and third sessions, and the floor was overwhelmed by them. The situation suddenly fell, but the major bulls continued to absorb without loosening. As a result, each month fell by one or two dimes. The transaction volume was statistically 47,200 bales. The sales volume showed Dafu selling 4,200 bales, Tongji 1,700 bales, Taixing 1,600 bales, Gengfeng 1,600 bales, Yuanda 1,300 bales, Yuanyi 1,500 bales, and Duo Chang 13,500 bales.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was serious. The weather was still arid, but it was tired due to profit-taking and Wall Street's sluggishness. As a result, spot fell by ten points, and futures fell by twelve to fourteen points. British cotton futures fell by one point. The Indian cotton market was stagnant, waiting for the US government report to be released. The Pingaier and Omla rose by 0.25, and the White Luo Creek rose by 0.5 rupees.

<h3 id="e183">Flour Rises and Falls Have Lost Their Normal State <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Chasing Evidence Unclear, Opening Delayed Until Afternoon</p>
<p>The flour market was suspended for a day due to chasing evidence the day before. Until yesterday morning, the suspension had to be extended because the chasing evidence was still unclear. It was not until 2:30 that the market opened. At the meeting, in addition to the sharp increase of two dimes in wheat the day before and yesterday morning, the excitement of the people could not be avoided due to the facts. The initial opening of this month was 0.68 yuan, and then it was raised to as much as 0.7 yuan. The opening price for September rose sharply by 0.72 yuan. However, after this huge peak, a state of rapid and sharp decline occurred. When the opening price was 0.72 yuan, the factory side and the Dalian Yingkou gangs, having bulls taking profits, went out wildly, so they immediately returned to 0.6825 yuan. Because of the instability of September, it has already been revealed, so the opening price for October and below has seen a sharp drop, generally between 0.645 yuan, already showing an inverted hanging. Therefore, the opening price in the second session of this month fell by seven or eight cents, down to 0.612 yuan. The distant term also continued to fall at the same time. The complex and intricate processes that passed through completely exposed the various forms of the speculative market. It can be seen that the value of commodities is still largely promoted by people's hearts. If the government cares about the people's suffering, it should show that it may cancel the import tax on rice and wheat when necessary, or provide convenience for supporting manufacturers in order to alleviate hardship. If speculation is timid, its arrogance will subside. It is unknown whether the government in charge has ever considered this. As a result, this month was good for two cents, September fell half a cent, October fell 0.75 yuan, November and December fell 0.075 yuan, and January fell half a cent.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Wheat Market Extremely Chaotic <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Large Rises and Falls: The Front and Back Markets Reach a Total of 0.2 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, again presented a fierce rising wind. Although foreign wheat quotations fluctuated by one dime from each other, the price of domestic wheat was already stimulated by the Shanghai market. Along the Jinpu line, the combined price was already similar to that of Shanghai. Therefore, after opening, the market atmosphere was initially stable, but then it flew freely into the air, and competing for more advances continued without end, causing each session to soar step by step. At the highest point, this month was as high as 4.05 yuan, September was as high as 0.18 yuan, and October to December was as high as 0.289 yuan, rising by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. By the time the afternoon market opened, this month was as high as 4.09 yuan, but when September opened, the flour market turned down, people's hearts were already empty. After this opening price, it fell sharply step by step. The chaos during the process was also rare in recent years, and the total amount of the fall reached 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. As a result, September fell by 0.03 yuan, November fell by 0.02 yuan, and the rest were similar to the previous day. Because the current wheat market price is already high, factories reject each other, and it may be necessary to drop a little before moving to buy.</p>
<h3 id="e185">River Bottom Rice Prices Rise Without Exception <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of the various gangs were slightly scarce, with a total of seventeen or eighteen ships arriving (the goods are close to 3,000 piculs), and since the sales market had tightened once before noon the day before, the situation at the opening yesterday showed repeated gains. The stores on this street had a strong desire to buy, and the customers of the merchant gangs also had some activity. The Qingdao gang purchased more than 200 bags of late rice, and the slightly scarce arrivals on the market immediately showed a tight situation. As a result, the prices of indica rice such as those from the Chang Gang, Su Tong, and Nan Gang, and the late rice such as the Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, etc., all saw increases of two or three dimes. The Du Yang and Jian rice each had their own beautiful colors, and in addition to changing yuan, they also continued to rise. As for the Pudong New Indica Rice, because the new rice has gradually emerged, the price is still 11 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, seventeen or eighteen ships from various gangs arrived at the river bottom. The sales of various goods on the market were quite active. The market situation saw prices for white indica early rice rise by about 0.2 yuan, the price of white yuan rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan, thin rice was tight, and the price of sheep Du Jian rose by nearly one dime, with the clients' sharp rice following the rise by one or two dimes. The Dongxin rice even had more arrivals, and the price was also stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Foreign Customer Indica Rice Soars by Five or Six Dimes <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Northern and Jiujiang Gangs Purchasing Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign customer indica rice market situation initially did not look upward because the Saigon fixed order deliveries were continuing to arrive at the port, and the Saigon price opened the previous day was considered too high. Unexpectedly, after going on the market, mainland gangs rushed to Shanghai to purchase, with letters and telegrams flying, and the purchase desire was very strong. The market immediately became tense. Amidst the competition among the various mainland client's purchase, the Jiujiang gang suddenly arrived at the market to inquire about the small "Jiao", and even the Northern gang approved 2,000 bags of small "Jiao" spot goods with the same industry experts, and also pre-ordered 1,000 tons of Saigon. Therefore, people's hearts were excited, and the market price unexpectedly achieved soaring prosperity. News also reported that Wuhu rice prices rose by two yuan, and news of rice shortages everywhere, the tension in the market situation, was not seen for a long time. Small "Jiao" rice rose from 9.3 yuan to 9.55 yuan, rising by 0.45 yuan on a large scale, with a total of 10,000 bags, which were distributed by the Northern, Jiujiang, and mainland gangs. This street handled 2,500 bags of Saigon, with the price reaching 11.35 yuan. Old Saigon also opened to 10.4 yuan, and the prices all rose by three or four dimes. The Mainland gang competing to purchase milling and rough indica rice, caused the market to surge even more. Milling oil rice was as high as 9.85 yuan, milling Jing was as high as 10.1 yuan, Jing was as high as 9.2 yuan, Wuhu milling indica was as high as 9.6 yuan, Shashi rough rice was 7.8 yuan, and Hankou rough rice was as high as 8 yuan. Various milling indica rice from Chuzhou, Nanjing, and Taizhou all reached 9.5, 6, or 7 yuan, respectively. In total, more than 12,000 bags were traded throughout the day, with the market price being much larger than the previous day, with five or six dimes and three or four dimes not being equal. According to the current market situation, people's hearts are still hoping for the best, and it is not easy to fall back unless a large number of foreign rice arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e187">Autumn Silk and Satin Transactions Already Starting <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since last month, the domestic silk and satin market has been quite bleak. The autumn goods have not yet been purchased by the mainland clients, but heaven silk plain brocade was once in short supply, resulting in absolutely firm and high prices. As a result, various factories increased processing and production, and the source of goods suddenly increased, showing a weakening. The summer goods of the silk and satin shops on this street have already been sufficient to sell in the market. Patterned and thin goods still have miscellaneous transactions. The autumn goods transactions saw a sudden purchase by the Sichuan gang (Chengdu customers). Yesterday's transaction was 80 bolts of 22-inch brocade-ground crepe, with a reported price of 1.1 yuan per yard, as a common body. More than 110 bolts of 22-inch soft satin were sold, with a selling price of 0.8 yuan per yard. There were also sporadic transactions in patterned goods. However, the Chongqing customers of the Sichuan gang have not yet seen the purchase of autumn goods.</p>
<p>Foreign silk and satin, such as satin-backed Indian silk and stocking silk and other autumn goods, have been gradually transported in small numbers by foreign firms. In the current market transactions, satin-backed Indian silk is easier to move. Various summer thin goods still have sporadic transactions, and the prices are stable. 31-inch Mason satin-backed Indian silk is 4.25 yuan per yard, and 27-inch Ruida printed Indian silk is 4.75 yuan per yard. This street had some transactions, but the outer gangs did not move.</p>

<p>丨Calculated According to New York Opening Price丨</p>
<p>The New York raw silk market, due to the dumping of Japanese silk, the Chinese silk also followed suit. B-grade Shanghai white factory silk, 80-point evenness, 21/22 denier, opened at only 1.1 yuan per pound. When converted to Chinese currency, the price per bale had already fallen below the 400 yuan mark. 83-point evenness was only 420.3 yuan in Chinese currency, differing by more than one hundred yuan from the capital released by Chinese merchants. Domestic silk merchants also insisted on not buying unless prices were lowered. The various manufacturers stopped their cars due to excessive costs. Yesterday, only Yingzhuang and others entered 10 bales of new dried Jing silk and 15 bales of yellow coarse silk, and the prices both saw a drop. Sichuan and Hubei's stored silk has become thicker, and they are also shipping batches to Shanghai. The Xianghe and Pinghe, two wheels from the previous two days, imported a total of 67 bales of new yellow silk from Mianyang, cotton states, Yichang, Changsha, and other ports (100 catties per bale), which were separately deposited by Baotaihe and others in silk stacks for sale.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a slightly smaller customs gold and the value of Saturday, and there was also a rumour that there will be a customs closure next Monday, so the trend was tired and weak. The association's allocated plate of 24 coarse sand white spot goods called for the original price and did not succeed, with the delivery at the pier being 20.002 yuan, slightly less than the previous day. The goods in this stack, which were inferior, were 20 yuan. The original price of the coarse sand Dutch red road goods was still being opened. The Chao bang numbers opened more than 500 bags of Chaoqing, including Huanggangqing at 13.55 yuan, Longgangqing at 12.9-12.9 yuan, and the second one at 12.85 yuan.</p>

<p>The number of new orchid seeds produced this year is not many, so the high-quality goods in the first, second, and third batches all opened to 47-48 yuan, and the second to 43-44 yuan, with varying prices. Yesterday, the high-quality goods arrived in only ten boxes by the Shun Wheel from Xiamen, and the market situation was still firm.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Savings <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Thin Autumn</p>
<p>Saving is the act of accumulating money that has been saved. Because a person living in the world inevitably encounters disasters, illnesses, and all sorts of unexpected accidents. If one does not have savings during ordinary times, how can one cope with these unexpected accidents? Therefore, saving is indeed a virtue.</p>
<p>The methods of saving can be roughly divided into two types: one is saving in whole numbers, and the other is saving in small amounts. The former can only be done by people with ample financial resources, while the latter can be done by anyone. For example, there is a child whose father gives him ten cents of silver every day for snacks and candy. What does he do? He only spends twenty copper coins each day, saving the remaining ten coins. At the end of each month, he exchanges them for one silver dollar and deposits it in the bank. If he keeps doing this without interruption, he will have a savings of four hundred and seventeen yuan after fifteen years. Moreover, this savings only includes a principal of one hundred and eighty yuan, with the remaining two hundred and thirty-seven yuan being interest. This is the method of accumulating small amounts into a large sum, gathering a fur coat from fox scraps. If this child did not save ten copper coins every day, he would certainly not have this savings.</p>
<p>Children! Are you willing to save? Then please start saving from today. It would be better if you can save ten copper coins every day, but if not, five or three coins are also fine. As long as you persevere, you will naturally have a substantial sum of money.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Fearless Marconi <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Children, when you listen to the radio, you probably always think of Marconi's great achievements for us. But he did not succeed by luck. His family was very poor, but he still diligently studied radio. When he first completed his first radio machine, he was extremely proud. He borrowed money and wanted to go from Italy to England to visit a well-known radio expert.</p>
<p>At that time, it was during the war. The customs inspector checked his radio and mistakenly thought it was military equipment. Although Marconi tried hard to explain, no one believed him, and it was eventually thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>Marconi suffered this failure and was plagued by poverty and illness, but he did not lose heart. He continued his research and finally invented this useful thing, contributing it to the world.</p>
<p>Children, what do you think after hearing this story? Failure is not shameful. Being discouraged after failure is the most useless thing. Things in the world often succeed after failure!</p>

<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>Ice Boy was pressed under the ice bucket, unable to breathe. So he slowly climbed upwards, wanting to climb out of the ice bucket to cool off a bit.</p>
<p>Ice Elder saw this and asked, "Where are you hurrying to?" Ice Boy replied:</p>
<p>"I want to go outside, I really can't stand the stuffiness inside!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ice Elder said in a panic, "You can't go! You can't go! It's very dangerous outside. There are tigers outside, the sun will swallow you, there are poisonous snakes, the wind will blow you away. Just sit inside peacefully!"</p>
<p>Ice Boy didn't listen, saying, "I'm not afraid of tigers and poisonous snakes outside. Look, they have never come in!"</p>
<p>"Child! That's right, but we are united inside. If we are united, they won't dare to invade or oppress us. But when you go outside, they will definitely bully you because you are alone."</p>
<p>Ice Boy wouldn't listen! He kept climbing upwards. Just as he stepped onto the top of the bucket, suddenly there was a "snap" and he fell, shattering into pieces, and was swallowed by the tigers and the sun.</p>
<p>Children! Remember: As a child, you must not be stubborn. You must be adaptable in everything you do. See, didn't Ice Boy lose his life because of stubbornness?</p>
<p>Bing Er was a lively and innocent child, usually jumping around happily. Last night, for some reason, he suddenly clutched his stomach and cried out in pain, his eyebrows furrowed, looking very distressed. Mother asked anxiously, "Weren't you eating lunch just fine this morning? How did you suddenly get a stomachache? Did you eat something?" Bing Er didn't dare to hide anything and told the truth, "After I finished lunch today, I was very thirsty, so I bought a cup of ice cream and three cents worth of watermelon at the entrance of the alley. Who knew that before long, I would feel a dull pain in my abdomen, and now it's getting worse and worse, it feels like something is tightly squeezing it!"</p>
<p>Later, Bing Er recovered from his illness and never dared to buy things randomly on the street again.</p>

<p>Miss Cicada put on a light gauze dress and lived in a villa built of leaves. In the morning, she drank some sweet dew, at noon she sang a few songs, and in the evening, she lay on the well-ventilated branches to cool off. She thought that her destiny was to have such good fortune.</p>
<p>One day, Ant younger brother pushed a cart of rice past Miss Cicada's tree and suddenly heard a melodious singing voice. Ant thought, "This must be when Miss Cicada is singing and making merry again. I should advise her to work." So Ant climbed up the tree.</p>
<p>Miss Cicada felt very bad after hearing Ant's advice and said to Ant, "I know, but it's already late today. I'll start working tomorrow." Ant happily said goodbye to Miss Cicada and went back to pushing rice.</p>
<p>The next day, Ant carried a bag of flour and passed by Miss Cicada's tree again. Miss Cicada was still singing. Ant climbed up to advise her again. Miss Cicada saw Ant coming and quickly said, "I know, I know! It's already late today, I'll start working tomorrow!" Ant climbed down the tree very disappointed. Carrying the flour, he left.</p>
<p>On the third day, Ant carried a load of sugar and passed by Miss Cicada's tree again. He still heard the melodious singing voice. Ant knew that Miss Cicada was a lazy creature who loved leisure and hated work, so he stopped being friends with her and carried the sugar away.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day... When Ant passed by Miss Cicada's tree, he heard Miss Cicada still singing loudly: "I know! I know!"</p>

<p>丨Original from (Japanese Elementary School Reader)丨</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the sun and the wind wanted to have a strength contest. They decided that whoever could make the traveler take off his coat would be the winner. The wind started first.</p>
<p>The wind said, "How about it? Let me roll up and show you!" So the wind blew fiercely. At that time, the traveler became colder and colder as the wind blew, so he wore his coat tighter and tighter.</p>
<p>This time it was the sun's turn. The sun showed its gentle face from the gaps in the clouds and shone its warm sunlight. The traveler felt warm on his ears and finally took off his coat, so the wind was considered to have lost.</p>

<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and the thermometer has risen to about one hundred degrees. Cold drink stalls are set up on every street. Many people, because they are thirsty, buy things that flies have landed on to eat, regardless of whether the food is clean or not. Who knows that eating these things is very dangerous. Acute epidemic diseases such as cholera and vomiting are caused by these unclean things!</p>
<p>The above is all known to everyone. Other things, such as ladybugs, horsehair wasps, wall lizards, and jumping spiders, also feed on small insects. The small insects they eat are harmful to us humans, so carnivorous insects are mostly beneficial insects. Children, how should we protect these insects that are beneficial to humans?</p>

<p>— Han Sheng</p>
<p>Summer vacation has started, and the weather is really hot. Younger brother is a smart child. He set up a home animal garden.</p>
<p>What is this home animal garden like?</p>
<p>On the lawn in front of the house, there are flowers and trees, and also a wooden frame with potted plants. The site of the animal garden is here.</p>
<p>Younger brother hung the parrot and its cage on the holly tree, moved the goldfish bowl to the middle of the lawn, and moved Linlin's kennel from the door, letting it bark beside the kennel. He filled a large lead basin with water and caught the ducklings to swim in it. He also drove the white rooster, fat hen, and chicks from behind the house. He also borrowed a parrot and four canaries from the neighbor, hanging them on the loquat tree with their stands and cages. Our white-spotted big cat was also caught by younger brother and tied with a rope, because he was afraid it would bite the ducklings and chicks. It was out of luck.</p>
<p>Our home animal garden opened, and younger brother and younger sister invited many children to visit us here.</p>
<p>Next to each animal, we tied a piece of cardboard with its name written on it with a rope for the visitors' reference.</p>
<p>We gave each visiting child four crackers. We didn't give them out the second time. We also prepared an autograph book, and everyone who came had to sign their name on it. This home animal garden was closed after two days because the weather was too hot and we wanted to go to the shade of the trees in the park to play.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Names of Several Types of Flying Vehicles <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>Nowadays, the sky has become a means of transportation for humans! In countries with advanced science, many flying vehicles fly continuously day and night in the air between two or more cities. Even in our China, we can often see several Chinese and foreign joint venture airplanes flying in the air.</p>
<p>In China, there are many terms that are not unified. Taking just the terms for flying vehicles as an example: when we see a monoplane land aircraft flying in the air, everyone shouts: "Look! A flying boat is coming!" But when a biplane seaplane is moving in the sky, everyone shouts: "Look! A flying boat is coming!" They call both things "flying boats." This is really a mistake! Children, can you tell the difference clearly?</p>
<p>In fact, it is very easy to distinguish the types of flying vehicles. Now, I have drawn several types that I know. In this way, after looking at it, you will generally not confuse the names of flying vehicles again.</p>
<p>The flying vehicles in this picture, except for airships, flying boats, and balloons, are the rest we have seen in the air. In addition, there are gliders... Because there are no perfect and good results, they are not included. As for the names of the uses of airplanes, such as warplanes, bombers, commercial airplanes, etc., are also not included.</p>

<p>— Gong Ji Tang</p>
<p>Most insects live by eating the leaves and branches of plants; another part of insects live by eating meat. However, the meat they eat is not like the beef and pork that we humans eat, but rather small animals, especially insects. Here are a few common examples:</p>
<p>1. Dragonflies: They have transparent and powerful wings, fly in the air, and use their sharp and strong mouthparts to catch small insects as food. Their larvae are called water nymphs and also catch small insects such as mosquito larvae for food.</p>
<p>2. Mantises: They use their first pair of legs, which have turned into knives, to catch insects for food.</p>
<p>3. Spiders: They also catch insects for food. Their tool for catching insects is a web made of silk.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Danger of Playing with "Simple Balloons" and Its Remedies <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Xin Quan</p>
<p>In the previous issue of the Children's Weekly, there was an article by Mr. Zi Jing on how to make and play with "simple balloons"; according to Mr. Zi Jing's purpose, it was nothing more than to make children understand the function of air, which is very admirable. However, this way of playing has not been said completely, because the balloon will inevitably be blown away by the wind after it rises into the air, even if it is blown a mile away. I remember six or seven years ago, several people (adults) were also playing with this thing. After the balloon rose into the air and was blown away by the wind, each person dispersed when they could no longer see the balloon. The next day, a message came from a village saying that a sky fire had burned down more than a dozen thatched houses.</p>
<p>Therefore, children who play this balloon in the open space must tie a thin string under the balloon to prevent danger, and at most let it rise to a height of one or two zhang. This way of playing is already very interesting and also much safer.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Sweat <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>After we have worked or because of the hot weather, our skin will be covered in damp sweat. But what is sweat made of? I will briefly explain the common knowledge about sweat as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Sweat Secretion: Sweat comes from the sweat glands in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. There are blood vessels around the sweat glands. Blood from the blood vessels is filtered out to the sweat gland opening on the surface of the skin and excreted from the body. There are about 2.5 million sweat glands in our whole body, so there are densely distributed sweat glands in every part. However, the amount of sweat varies depending on the season and the person. Ordinary adults produce about half a liter (1 liter equals 1.08 Chinese sheng) to less than 1 liter per day. (2) Sweat Composition: Sweat is mostly water and contains fat, salt, urea, etc. Therefore, sweat tastes salty. After sweating, the urea and fat decompose and turn into ammonia, causing sweat odor. (3) Sweat Function: Sweating removes useless components from the blood, cleans the blood, and regulates body temperature. In summer, the body of an average person can reduce body temperature by 400 to 500 calories (a unit of heat) after sweating, making them feel cool. Therefore, the surface of the body is cool in summer. Chinese doctors use Chinese medicine to dispel heat for patients with fever. After the patient takes the medicine, they break out in a lot of sweat, which can reduce the fever. This is also the reason. (4) The Relationship Between Sweat and Nerves: In general, obese people have a thick layer of fat under their skin to maintain body temperature. In summer, because they release more body heat, they sweat more. If we are suddenly unhappy in spirit, our blood vessels contract, our nerves become excited, and our skin turns pale. Due to the effect of the sweat-producing nerves, we sweat cold sweat. Death sweat near the time of death is for this reason. Also, if the body is unwell, it will definitely constantly stimulate the sweat-producing nerves and cause more sweating. When this kind of sweat is produced, the body will feel uncomfortable. Also, if a person suffers from blood sweat disease, their sweat will contain more blood. If a person suffers from diabetes, their sweat will contain more sugar. These are all improper sweating. (5) The Relationship Between Sweat and Shoes and Socks: There are many sweat glands on the soles of the feet. The sweat secreted is confined by the tightness of the shoes and socks and is not ventilated. Therefore, when the shoes and socks are taken off, the fat and urea in the sweat decompose faster and the odor spreads everywhere. Therefore, feet should be washed and socks changed every day. (6) The Occurrence of Sweat Stains: If there is a lot of sweat on the surface of the skin and it stays on the skin for a long time without being washed away, the skin will be stimulated by the sweat and red sweat stains will appear. If not prevented, they will spread quickly. Therefore, after sweating, we should wash and disinfect our bodies and use powder to absorb moisture. That way, we can keep our bodies clean and prevent diseases.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The New Meaning of Motherhood <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xi Zhen</p>
<p>——To New Women——</p>
<p>Progressive Ladies:</p>
<p>You must know this: an accurate proposition is not afraid of multifaceted observation; one plus one equals two: no matter how you calculate it, it will not be wrong. Are we not trying to explain the path to true women's liberation from all aspects? Whether women want to achieve equality of social status, economic independence, liberation from etiquette, reasonable standards of sexual morality, etc., the path is still very clear, there is only one: to build a new society.</p>
<p>Originally, the social system is the greatest mystery of mankind, it is the spring in the clock, once it is solved and fixed, everything will become a problem. However, the process of improving a social system is very difficult; the biggest problem is the lack of a new standard. All the old society's standards of morality, good and evil, virtue and vice are necessarily unsuitable for the new society; and although establishing another new standard is urgently needed, it is also very difficult.</p>
<p>We should make the discussion more concrete: for example, we now hear the terms "virtuous mother and good wife" under the old three obediences and four virtues, and we will definitely regard it as like poison, right? However, that old society, even if it has no ill intentions, should ask us, "Don't new people need virtuous mothers and good wives, but need inferior wives and evil mothers?"</p>
<p>In this way, not only will the people who ask questions in the old society become more and more confused, but I am afraid that even we ourselves will find it difficult to answer specifically?</p>
<p>But in fact, this is a non-problem problem, answer briskly: "In the new era, in the new society, we also need virtuous mothers and good wives, just as we needed them in the old society. The only difference is that the meaning of the two words virtuous and good has a fundamental difference": that is to say: "The new and old views and standards of virtuous and good are absolutely different."</p>
<p>If we want to escape from the feudal social system, we should also understand the nature of the feudal society and the foundation of its standards of good and evil. The old society's economic distribution method was uneven, and benefits and power always fell on the side that enjoyed the economic surplus, so women were always the possessions of men. Their only requirements for women were obedience and educating a group of women who were their descendants. Therefore, the "goodness" of a wife lies in the three obediences and four virtues, and the "virtue" of a mother lies in her ability to educate her children well. A virtuous and good mother should not only be subject to and obey others herself, but also have to educate sons who dominate other women and daughters who obey other men.</p>
<p>This means that they are calling on every woman to build the strong walls that imprison herself and the fetters that bind herself.</p>
<p>What a cruel tragedy.</p>
<p>Mothers are worthy of pride, because they hold the fate of the next generation; and also worthy of fear, because they also hold the fate of the next generation.</p>
<p>The so-called virtuous mothers and good wives that we have seen before today are all big fools who teach the next generation of men to dominate the next generation of women, and teach the next generation of women to obey the next generation of men.</p>
<p>We hope (and believe) that the foolish thing of building walls to imprison oneself will never be seen again in the world in the future. In the new society of the future, we also need virtuous mothers and good wives, we want smart new mothers who "tear down" the walls themselves!</p>
<p>However, as I said earlier, modern women's liberation is not a comedy of "male struggle," but a big social problem (simply a common problem for both men and women). New women, in addition to their own struggles, should shift the eyes of their descendants to the unreasonableness of the social system.</p>
<p>"Make your children a group of people who are useful to the public!"</p>
<p>Only this kind of maternal education is reasonable, progressive, and expected by the new society.</p>
<p>The new good wife will know how to liberate herself from the shackles of the family and go to society; the new virtuous mother will know how to teach her descendants to continue her difficult journey.</p>
<p>That way, you see: don't we also need virtuous mothers and good wives? However, this is reasonable.</p>
<p>Progressive ladies, be proud, be fearful, because you are holding the fate of the next generation.</p>
<h3 id="e207">On Nurseries and Public Childcare: A Third Discourse <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>And a Response to Mr. Shi Shi</p>
<p>Regarding "Nurseries and Public Childcare," Mr. Shi Shi has commented twice, and I have also written twice to discuss it. In the July 13th issue of this newspaper's local supplement, there was another article by Mr. Shi Shi, "A Third Discussion on Nurseries and Public Childcare." After reading the entire article, I feel that Mr. Shi Shi has failed to adopt an objective attitude and examine the reasons held by those who argue against his views. Instead, he repeatedly expresses his own subjective opinions. This has diminished the nature of the discussion, and I was initially unwilling to write further on the matter. However, I believe that childcare is a facet of women's issues and a significant aspect of social issues. Readers will want to evaluate the rights and wrongs of the debate on this issue. Indeed, in the July 31st issue of the "Shishi Xinbao" in the "Modern Women" section, there was an article by Ms. Tan Shuangping titled "The Problem of Nurseries and Public Childcare," which provided a detailed refutation of Mr. Shi Shi's "Third Discussion on Nurseries and Public Childcare." Besides being pleased to find a kindred spirit, I would like to add some further points, jointly questioning Mr. Shi Shi and seeking public opinion from those concerned about social issues.</p>
<p>(1) After reading Mr. Shi Shi's three articles, the fundamental error lies in equating modern "public childcare" with the ancient Spartan state's ownership of children. He is thus fearful that once children are publicly cared for, they will lose their parents, and parents will be forever deprived of the joy of having their children around. However, common sense tells us that "public childcare" is not like that at all. Simply put, it means that the state spends money to provide scientific and organized childcare for the people, in the same way that the state spends money to run primary schools, middle schools, and universities. In that case, how does a child's enrollment in a publicly funded nursery sever their connection with their parents? This is precisely to benefit families and respect the meaning of life, and is certainly not against the natural order of procreation. Furthermore, take the Soviet Union, which has already implemented public childcare, for example. Have parents there completely abandoned their children, or do children lose their parents as soon as they enter a nursery? Mr. Shi Shi seems to believe that the Soviet Union's current foster care methods are not truly public childcare – of course, their methods may still be in the process of improvement, but this is a matter of method and irrelevant to the issue itself. However, in his first article on "Nurseries and Public Childcare," Mr. Shi Shi once said, "Public childcare in Europe and America is quite active and is being effectively implemented with success..." Now, Mr. Shi Shi suddenly denies this, stating, "Currently, I am afraid that only the Soviet Union has nurseries organized under the principle of public childcare, and their foster care is only 'boarding' and does not conform to the true meaning of public childcare." It is truly unknown what Mr. Shi Shi's so-called public childcare actually is.</p>
<p>(2) Having nurseries does not necessarily mean that it is public childcare, but countries that implement public childcare must universally establish nurseries. This is inevitable. The state should create labor nurseries in response to social needs, which can be considered the precursor to implementing public childcare. For the sake of liberating women and for the future of society, public childcare is truly necessary. Moreover, reality tells us that there are already nurseries established in China, which clearly demonstrates the need for them. Even incomplete institutions such as foundling homes, orphanages, and homes for poor children are so much in demand by society. Would complete nurseries under public childcare not be even more popular? Therefore, I believe that unless men are selfish and believe that all women only have the instinct to raise children, and force the future masters of the country to receive poor education, then with a clear understanding of the progress of society, they should recognize the necessity of implementing nurseries and public childcare. Therefore, the question is not whether public childcare should be implemented under the current Chinese system, but whether public childcare can be fully implemented. In the present situation where all education is still commercialized, it is of course impossible to universally implement public childcare. However, we cannot oppose it simply because it is impossible.</p>
<p>(3) In his most recent article, Mr. Shi Shi admits that the existing nurseries in Europe and America are only improved foundling homes. In that case, the infant mortality rate in Parisian public childcare cited by Mr. Shi Shi from the writings of the famous American sociologist Edward Alsworth Ross cannot be considered an example of true public childcare.</p>
<p>In summary, I am not trying to make things difficult for Mr. Shi Shi. It is just that Mr. Shi Shi's great arguments contain considerable errors. As Ms. Tan Shuangping said, "For the sake of upholding the truth," it is necessary to engage in analytical discussion with Mr. Shi Shi. This is my original intention in writing three articles to refute his arguments. I hope the readers can make a fair judgment and also express their opinions on this issue.</p>
<h3 id="e208">A Great Woman Among Oppressed Nationalities <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Le Ji</p>
<p>——Mrs. Naidu——</p>
<p>When speaking of great figures among oppressed nationalities, I believe everyone will remember Mahatma Gandhi of India. The person I want to introduce now is a woman who is contemporary to him, from the same country, and possesses the same spirit as him. Who is this person? It is Mrs. Naidu.</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Naidu is a woman in India, an oppressed country that also devalues women, her spirit and deeds will exist alongside the history of India, and she is truly comparable to Gandhi. Like Gandhi, she rejected the idea of class consciousness early on. She was born into the high-ranking Brahmin caste, but in her own marriage, she set an example by breaking free from the constraints of class.</p>
<p>She is a great writer and a great politician at the same time. In 1924, she became a member of the Royal Society of Literature in England, and she is the only woman in all of India who has served as the president of the Indian National Congress. She also attended the Indian Round Table Conference held in London in 1932 with Gandhi. Imprisonment cannot break her determined spirit. She once said: As long as my life exists, and as long as my blood flows in this hand, I will never give up the struggle for freedom. Arise, my warriors! Although I am just a woman, a poet, in terms of women, I give you weapons of faith and boldness, and an indomitable spirit; in terms of poets, I call out singing banners, the sound of bugles on the battlefield, how will I awaken you men, so that everyone can break free from the shackles of slavery!?</p>
<p>Her appearance is short and vigorous, and her eyes are especially bright. Her spirit seems to ignite emotions, but she treats people with great peace. She completely expresses her inner suffering in poetry. She has a smart mind, a mind that flashes like lightning. She often engages in the pursuit of beauty, and she often transforms everything in the world into golden words and golden deeds. Her life has almost been consumed by curiosity about various things. She can be deeply worried and wildly happy. Her laughter is even more mysterious, a unique talent she possesses. Her laughter may be a kind of mask. However, it is this laughter that enables her mind to see things clearly when her heart cannot bear it. Therefore, she can laugh loudly when reciting her wild songs, and she can laugh when she is enthusiastic. She once wrote in a letter, "Among the talents that Heaven has given me, the one I value most is laughter." In fact, in her environment, only laughter can overcome everything and tolerate everything.</p>
<p>She is already fifty-five years old this year and the mother of four grown children. Although her body is aging day by day, her spirit of fighting for national freedom never slackens. She truly deserves to be a great woman among oppressed nationalities!</p>

<h3 id="e210">Divorce and Educational Bankruptcy <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Lun</p>
<p>| Regarding the Divorce of Ms. C in H City |</p>
<p>Ms. C is a highly respected teacher in H City. Not long ago, she married a male friend she had known for many years. However, after a few months of marriage, she discovered that there was no true love between them; and the man also had marital disputes elsewhere. Emotionally and rationally, there was no need to continue living together, so she directly and frankly proposed a divorce to the man. Although the man was very concerned about his image, he also knew that it was impossible to force her, and their divorce was handled unconditionally.</p>
<p>This was originally a very ordinary, very normal, and very bright thing, and should not have caused any criticism. However, this society is a male-centered society. Women being divorced or abandoned in tangible and intangible ways is common, while divorce initiated by women seems to be a reversal of heaven and earth, and should not happen at all. Because this society is a society that follows old customs and is content with the status quo, even if the couple has different dreams in the same bed, or are incompatible like ice and charcoal, or have become mortal enemies, they should still maintain the form of the family on the surface, taking care of face and reputation (although the author does not know what this face is, or what this reputation is), until they grow old together. At the same time, this society is also a society that despises women, believing that women are born with the centuries-old inheritance of "marrying a chicken, following a chicken, marrying a dog, following a dog" – which is what most people consider to be the virtue of women. They definitely do not have the ability to be independent and self-reliant, and they are definitely not allowed to have self-awareness.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a self-aware divorce event like that of Ms. C occurs, it will naturally cause a lot of criticism. Because she is engaged in education, some people are even heartbroken and denounce it as "educational bankruptcy." Educational bankruptcy and divorce are clearly as different as a horse's head and an ox's mouth, but they insist on linking them together. The author is not smart enough to find the relationship between the two!</p>
<p>Of course, educational bankruptcy is a social problem; at the same time, divorce is also a social problem, but these are just two individual social problems, and there is no causal relationship to speak of. If you say that because Ms. C is engaged in education, and people engaged in education get divorced, it is educational bankruptcy, then this is truly a ridiculous logic!</p>
<p>Regarding marriage, we do not advocate rapid separations and reunions like changing Qin for Chu in the morning and evening, but we also never support puppet partners who are seemingly united but actually estranged. In feudal Chinese families, there are more or less living widows, and more or less women who are trampled on, abandoned, and deceived. I hope they will raise their heads like Ms. C and settle accounts with the other party! Whether they are working, staying at home, engaged in education, etc....</p>
<p>If a woman engaged in education who initiates a divorce due to self-awareness is considered "educational bankruptcy," then we might as well hope that women who stay at home, work, or do other things will have a family bankruptcy, industrial bankruptcy, or | | bankruptcy.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Common Sense for Summer Families—Infant Diarrhea <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Du Bu</p>
<p>Intestinal inflammation is most likely to occur in infants around one year old.</p>
<p>The most common diarrheal disease in young children is intestinal inflammation, which is most common among infants around one year old. As for artificially fed infants, intestinal inflammation can easily occur even at four or five months of age, especially as a result of irregular feeding schedules and random feeding of various foods, resulting in chronic nutritional disorders. Special attention must be paid to the diarrheal condition of such poorly developed infants.</p>
<p>Symptoms of intestinal inflammation</p>
<p>When intestinal inflammation occurs in infants, the initial symptom is only an increase in the number of bowel movements. It does not cause acute symptoms like dysentery and bacillary dysentery. The progress is relatively slow, so it is often overlooked. If appropriate treatment is applied urgently at the beginning of the illness, it can be quickly cured. If no attention is paid and it is treated lightly, fever will begin after a few days, accompanied by vomiting, increased diarrhea, dry mouth, and deep breathing, eventually leading to poisoning and an incurable disease. At this time, the body weight drops sharply, consciousness is blurred, convulsions occur frequently, and life is in danger. The possibility of death accounts for more than two-thirds.</p>
<p>The digestive function of infants is already weaker than usual in the summer heat. If diarrhea occurs, the digestive power of infants with nutritional disorders will be reduced from one-third to one-half at the beginning of the illness. If they are still given the usual amount of food at this time, the condition will inevitably worsen, eventually leading to fever and poisoning symptoms.</p>
<p>It is better to pay attention to food and drink than to give medicine.</p>
<p>Therefore, when an infant suffers from diarrhea, it is necessary to stop giving food and drink, or at least reduce it by two-thirds from the usual amount, and quickly seek medical treatment in order to preserve its lovely little life. The doctor will examine the strength of the infant's gastrointestinal tract and determine the appropriate food and amount, and pay attention to the symptoms at any time to ensure safety. At that time, food is sometimes more effective than medicine. However, it is definitely not something that can be handled casually by someone without medical training.</p>
<p>The effect of prevention cannot be absolutely guaranteed.</p>
<p>For diseases such as dysentery and bacillary dysentery, preventive injections are usually used, or the internal medicine "Valve Qing" is taken. However, whether injections or internal medicines are administered, daily health care should still be paid attention to, and everyday life should be treated with caution to raise infants with hygienic habits, because no other preventive method has a 100% effect.</p>
<p>Correspondence</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a traitor to my family, and I have been away for six years. But now I am very shaken and hesitant day and night, and I specially ask for your help.</p>
<p>I entered hell (forgive me! I never want to mention that hateful word) in the eighth year of the Republic of China, in the so-called "semi-new and semi-old" way at that time. That is, the parents have already decided, and then the mother will take a photo for me to see. The air that night was very mysterious and solemn, the windows were tightly closed, and the mother's throat was trembling, with no trace of a smile. I remember clearly that I didn't see anything, I didn't nod, but I didn't shake my head either. God! Why did I lose even the sense of shaking my head at that time? Just because I didn't shake my head, my living life was cut off with a single blow at the young age of sixteen.</p>
<p>After that, I really don't want to mention life afterwards. My every word and deed are flawed. They talked about the lewd behavior of someone else's daughter, and the collapse of someone else's career every day, and laughed gleefully at every misfortune, and I couldn't not laugh, and it wasn't possible to occasionally shed a tear when I laughed. I couldn't read newspapers or novels, I couldn't go back to my mother's house or visit my classmates and sisters, and I couldn't even correspond with them, because female students are mostly not good things (their common saying). I couldn't recite a poem of hatred, and I couldn't sing a few songs to relieve my worries. I am completely a living dead person. I gave birth to two children, and I am not allowed to participate in any opinion on education. The children are either beaten for no reason, or taken to the theater, gambling place, or brothel. I am heartbroken all day long for my two children ten times more than I am for myself.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Army pacified Jiangnan, and my courage was somehow strengthened by the sound of liberation. One night, while the room was filled with the smell of alcohol, I took my two children and left home. Unexpectedly, before I could find a way to make a living, I was chased back fiercely. This time, I suffered not only mental punishment.</p>
<p>I endured physical and mental pain for my children for a long time. When I could no longer bear it, I quietly left. I looked back at the dark clouds of my hometown day by day, as if being chased by a demon, so I walked farther and farther day by day. Now, I am three thousand miles away from home. Now I am teaching a group of rural children who originally had no opportunity to study, but because I only ask the village for two coarse meals a day, I have maintained it for three years. I treat the children as my own, giving them all my enthusiasm. The children also treat me as their second mother, giving me extra respect and intimacy.</p>
<p>I want to rely on courage to make another place my home, and to treat children who have dropped out of school as my children, and to continue to do so for the rest of my life. But recently I have been shaken, shaken badly. Because now everyone is advocating the trend of virtuous mothers and good wives, I don’t know whether doing this and going home to be a virtuous mother and good wife is more upright? I am not a virtuous mother and good wife, is there still the value of a "person"? In this world, I want to choose the thing with the greatest meaning to do. If a virtuous mother and good wife is the only highest morality for women, then I can only painfully abandon this group of lovely and pitiful poor children, and return to that useless family of mine. However, that would be so painful! That's why I am hesitant, hesitant, day and night. I can't find clear discussions in the countryside, and I hope you can guide me!</p>
<p>Li Jinying, July 30th</p>
<p>Ms. Jinying:</p>
<p>We are very sympathetic to your past behavior, and we admire your enthusiasm twenty-four minutes. You are a warrior against the old etiquette and evil forces. You have been a virtuous mother, and a virtuous mother of many children. This meaning is much more upright than being a living dead at home. Why do you have to go home again? Everyone knows that there are two sexes on Earth, and women are qualified to be wives and mothers, but new women | | especially you who have already left, of course don't need to go home again, no, go back to the home you think is useless. The greatest meaning of life still lies in being independent: economically independent and personality independent! Under this conclusion, you don't have to hesitate. Brave you, don't be blinded by that charming smoke screen again, and be taken to be a prisoner again. I wonder what you think? Reporter</p>

<h3 id="e213">New Developments and Trends in Japan's Invasion of China <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Xiang</p>
<p>Since the "Tanggu Truce," people have believed that Japan's predatory behavior towards us has come to an end. Little did they know that although the sound of imperialist Japan's cannons attacking North China has ceased on the surface, in reality, not only have the Japanese troops in the war zone not withdrawn, and the various ports along the Chang River have not been returned, but also North China, Mongolia, and even South China and Fujian have been subjected to new threats from Japan's economic, political, and military forces. Judging from the current situation, not only will the quantity of Japanese goods dumped increase day by day, not only will the activities of Chinese traitors bought by the Japanese side become more rampant, but also the Japanese army has the possibility of attacking China again and plundering Chinese territory.</p>
<p>We know that after the "September 18th" Incident, because the people of the country worked hard to boycott Japanese goods, for a time, Japanese trade with China almost completely stopped, and it suffered a very serious blow economically. However, not long after, our boycott movement declined due to various reasons, and Japanese trade with China not only gradually restored its original state, but also had new developments. According to business circles, "According to the recent announcement by the Japanese Commercial Office, in the first half of this year, Japanese trade with China has indeed shown an improving trend. The total value of imports and exports is JPY 111,125,200, an increase of JPY 25,591,000 compared to the same period last year. The export of Japanese goods to China totaled JPY 51,154,200, an increase of JPY 2,762,000 compared to the same period last year. If the Northeast and Hong Kong are added, the total trade volume reaches JPY 300 million, occupying an absolutely superior position in the trade of various countries with China. After the implementation of the new tariff, it has provided convenience for the import of Japanese goods, and the export to China in the second half of this year should have a significant increase. The movement to boycott Japanese goods in the north and south has almost completely disappeared in the first half of this year and is no longer a problem." (A report from a certain newspaper on the 29th) 丨丨 This is a new record and prediction of Japan's economic aggression against China.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to establish its so-called "South China Policy," the Governor-General of Taiwan specially convened the "Five-Prefecture Conference on the Other Shore" recently. In this meeting, in addition to some of the most important proposals related to Japan's invasion of China, which are impossible to know because the Japanese side strictly maintains secrecy, there are also these noteworthy resolutions 丨</p>
<p>One, promote the doctrine of "Sino-Japanese Friendship" as the guiding principle;</p>
<p>One, dump coal in South China;</p>
<p>One, open up the Taiwan pineapple canned food market in China;</p>
<p>One, guide and reward the colonial industry of registered residents.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Our answer is: Japanese imperialism not only wants to annex North China, but also covets South China, and attempts to enslave the entire Chinese nation under the guise of "promoting the doctrine of 'Sino-Japanese Friendship'" 丨</p>
<p>As for North China and Mongolia, they are even more regarded by Japanese imperialism as "spheres of influence," and everything can be freely handled by them, and outsiders are not allowed to interfere. Recently, the Japanese side stated that all military exercises by the powers in North China must be notified to Japan in advance, which is an example of it already considering North China as its own. As for its military and political activities in Mongolia, openly buying Chinese traitors in North China, freely recruiting troops, and establishing political groups, they are even more blatant manifestations of its ambition to annex North China. Recently, various parties have widely spread the rumor that Japan will send troops to invade Suiyuan and Chahar within a few months: although this may not be credible, everyone knows that the fierce and sinister Japanese imperialism is eager to annex North China. The question is when and under what circumstances it will begin to act. If the time is right, the Japanese army can start attacking us under any pretext. Wasn't the Zangben Incident not long ago an ugly drama in which Japan wanted to coerce us with the pretext of the disappearance of its diplomats in China? From this, it can be seen that as long as the time is right, Japanese imperialism can do anything. However, judging from the current situation, the possibility of Japan opening fire on China again is indeed likely to happen at any time!</p>
<p>However, China is not simply the market of Japan alone, but a semi-colony jointly ruled by international imperialism, especially Britain, Japan, and the United States. The result of Japan's continuous attacks on China will inevitably directly harm the interests of the powers, especially Britain and the United States, so as to cause serious conflicts between them, and even lead to war. The warlords and politicians in Tokyo have also seen this, but in order to save the economic and political crisis in their country, and in order to gain a superior position in future wars, they have to take advantage of the current conflict situation of the European and American powers, and desperately launch various attacks on China, so as to quickly ignite the fire on the Pacific. Therefore, in the final analysis, the only destination of Japan's desperate invasion of China is to go to war, a cruel war 丨</p>
<p>Under this circumstance, China naturally has the possibility of becoming a victim of Japan and British, American and other imperialists, which is very dangerous: but at the same time, it is also an excellent opportunity for us to use the conflicts of imperialist powers, when all their own crises converge, to seek independence and find a way out. Therefore, we do not need to fear the attacks of Japan and all imperialists, but should take the opportunity to rise up and seek our own liberation. What is terrible is that we close our eyes and do not see the current situation, and always sleep without moving, allowing the enemy to slaughter and destroy us 丨</p>

<h3 id="e214">Clerk <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Dasheng</p>
<p>Under the current social system, a group of graduates from primary and secondary schools, outstanding students of old-fashioned teachers, and people who have received a little education under certain circumstances, because of their weak knowledge and abilities, are mostly difficult to obtain important positions in the current society. Their "superficial understanding" or even "ununderstanding" of academic ability determines their tragic future. They cannot avoid becoming victims of the times; they are difficult to have excellent gains in the vocational world, and even if they do, it is difficult to be competent for happy service. They did not load much "stuff" into their bellies earlier, and in this day of intensified and profound survival competition, it is natural that few of them will not fail miserably. (People with stuff in their bellies are now in the same fate.)</p>
<p>But they can still write well. Most of them also have the ability to endure hardship and work hard. Relying on this ability, they may not be able to exchange it for bread. The position of a clerk is not completely lacking or completely unfindable.</p>
<p>In this short article, I would like to describe a little about the lives of this type of people who take copying as their main job, and who may be called "clerks" or "assistants" in name</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>or "private secretaries." First of all, I want to talk about the hardship of the work of these people and the disproportion between the reward paid for this hardship. First, let's observe the hardship of the lives of the clerks in schools at all levels. Their more important work is mostly copying and mimeographing handouts, announcements, notices, official documents, letters, and other documents in the school. In universities, clerks have a more precise division of labor in their duties. The clerk in the president's office does not take care of the affairs of the dean's office or the registrar's office, and those who write mimeographs are only confined to their own small room and are accompanied by wax paper and steel plates. The situation in middle schools is relatively different. A clerk often serves as a staff member of the academic affairs office, and also takes care of the written matters of moral education and administrative affairs. Sometimes, he has to accept the trust and instructions from the president's office in his busy schedule. The clerk in the primary school is even more omnipotent. Almost all the copying and mimeographing matters in the entire school can hardly do without his wonderful hand.</p>
<p>Among the above three types of clerks, there is no doubt that the one who serves in the primary school is the most 　　 and gets the lowest reward. In the public primary schools in the counties of Jiangsu and Zhejiang where education is relatively developed, it must be considered a good thing if a clerk can exchange fifteen yuan a month for eight hours of blood and sweat. Last year, the author visited two large-scale county-run complete primary schools with as many as six or seven hundred students in Pudong and Nanhui. Each school hired a clerk with a monthly salary of fifteen yuan. Under the situation of exhausted educational funds in other provinces, few primary school clerks can get this amount. The situation in this city is similar. The author also paid this amount of monthly salary to the clerk of a primary school attached to a middle school that he used to work in in this city. What is said above is a more scaled higher and lower elementary school. Those primary schools with few students and simple facilities naturally cannot afford this amount at all, and most of them cannot afford such an employee at all. As for junior primary schools, in the case where the principal兼任the servant, it is almost a myth to say that they can hire a clerk. As for the majority of private primary schools, for the sake of poor income, their abacus will never be set to such a wasteful additional expenditure.</p>
<p>Middle school clerks can usually earn a monthly salary of twenty yuan in more scaled schools. Assuming that you "have served in the school for many years and have made outstanding achievements," your monthly salary can easily be increased to twenty-five yuan or thirty yuan due to the development of the school. If you want to rise further, then your hope may become a fantasy that is not easy to realize.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the treatment of clerks in universities. A clerk (often兼任secretary) serving in the president's office can receive a monthly salary of forty to sixty yuan. Although the situation in each school is not exactly the same, the difference is limited. The highest monthly income of clerks who write mimeographing handouts is difficult to exceed thirty yuan, and most of them are around twenty-five yuan. Those who serve in the president's office are mostly confidants of the school authorities or students of this school, while those who write mimeographs are mostly hired for their expertise in copying techniques. Due to the different qualifications, abilities, and positions, the rewards naturally cannot be equal.</p>
<p>Now I would like to talk about their suffering. Copying is originally an extremely mechanical and boring job, and anyone is afraid that they will not welcome it very much. But the most mechanical and unbearable of all copying work is probably mimeographing. No matter how expert a person is in this area, few of them will not frown at the wax paper, steel plate, and steel pen. They may write very well, but the words that appear on the wax paper are not beautiful enough; some problems caused by the poor quality of the wax paper and the steel pen and steel plate itself will further increase their impatience and annoyance. If you randomly grab one of these mimeographing experts and ask, you will immediately find that he talks about it with no shaking his head and sighing. Especially during the big and small exams, it is even more of an emergency when they are about to lose their lives. Mr. Ting's exam questions are also sent to be printed, and that Mr.'s exam questions are also sent to be printed. The teachers are all busy people, and they do not prepare early. They often send the exam questions the day before the exam. The exam questions of all the teachers are concentrated together, and the time is so urgent. In the midst of a thousand busyness, few of them do not make special sacrifices, "burning the midnight oil" all night, in order to avoid mistakes and falls in their duties, and get through this difficult time. Every semester, there are always a few days of tense days when they cannot sleep well. Some schools, especially primary schools, not only have to "write" themselves, but also have to "print" themselves. This hardship is of course even more advanced. Of course, schools are not the only ones that hire clerks. Various social, industrial, commercial, military, and political organizations also have some documents to be copied, and they all inevitably need this kind of talent. Their treatment in these various aspects cannot be exactly the same, but one thing is the same and deeply known to us, that is, their status is low, and everything must be subject to the command of superior staff. There is no freedom of will for themselves. They are only a puppet to be used. Their income is not difficult to infer from this position.</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about the misfortune of this group of people. After all, they are still people who have a legitimate occupation and can live on their own. There is a kind of people in the world who have higher qualifications and abilities and are also making a living by this copying job. I think they are a more unfortunate group of people. We know that there are countless unemployed college students, primary and secondary school teachers, and cultural people now. As long as they have a way to live on their own, no matter what kind of blood and sweat they have to pay, they may be happy to accept some difficult job. Scholars, celebrities, and experts often hire an "assistant" or "private secretary" and the like. The main purpose is to find someone to copy manuscripts, help collect materials, and cut, paste, sort, and organize various materials. This provides a way out for the group of people mentioned above. They naturally cannot get a salary based on their qualifications, and they will not get a high salary for their mechanical work. Scholars, celebrities, and experts do not necessarily hire "assistants" for a long time. After a certain job is completed, he will ask you to "rest" for a while, and he will come to "notify" you when a new job arrives. Their method of remuneration is not necessarily calculated on a monthly basis, but there are also those who use the "piecework system." If calculated on a monthly basis, they can generally pay thirty to forty yuan per month. If calculated on a piecework basis, each thousand words will not be less than two dimes of silver. In the past, a classmate who served in another area became unemployed midway and found his main professor. That gentleman gave his student some copying work and sent him thirty yuan a month. That classmate worked for two months and then went to find his own way. Another professor hired an assistant among the students and assigned him some copying manuscripts, clipping newspapers, and going to cultural institutions to copy relevant materials, and paid him forty yuan a month as remuneration. As for calculating by the word, the fastest in eight hours may not be able to copy 10,000 words, and even 7,000 or 8,000 words will take a lot of effort; as a result of burying your head at the desk all day, you only get more than one yuan. Also, this kind of clerk is often sent to various famous social organizations, such as big newspapers, big libraries, big factories, big banks... to copy some ready-made statistical and research materials. In winter, you cannot use the fact that your hands are frozen as a reason to say that you want to rest for a day or two; in this summer, you cannot make excuses because too much sweat is flowing, so as to delay the master's research. For the sake of life, you have to endure everything. It is understandable that you are a slave to your job; but if you ignore the reason for this, I think it is unforgivable.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Deer Industry <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Jieren</p>
<p>Everyone probably knows about deer! Don't you often read stories about deer in books? This is a beautiful and very docile animal, with a body covered with shiny brownish-yellow fine hair, interspersed with many white spots. The brownish-yellow body is scattered with circles of pure white small dots, which is really beautiful! Therefore, it is also called "spotted deer" or "sika deer". Deer also have a pair of slender, branching horns on their heads, like the top scholar who adds two flowers to his gauze hat in old operas. It is not wrong to compare it to the top scholar, as its beautiful coat is not like the top scholar's return home in glory at that time? Its place of origin is the interior of Taiwan that we have lost, where people set traps to catch it, but most of them are specially raised at home and transported to our China for sale. This kind of deer is also produced in our Guandong area, but the number is small. And the deer in Guandong is better than the deer in Taiwan, but the cost is higher and it cannot be used. So what are these deer used for? They are all used as medicinal materials. The "Whole Deer Pills" and "Deer Horn Glue" in Chinese medicine shops are made of deer. And "Deer Velvet" is the newly born horn of the deer, which is even more valuable.</p>
<p>In the early years, deer from Taiwan were all brought by sailboats and unloaded at the Zhenhai port in Zhejiang. They were sold to dealers in the area. New deer were transported every year in February and March, but most of them were still young and had to be raised for a few more months before they could be sold. The number transported each time was not very large, ranging from ten to twenty or thirty. In total, there were only more than one hundred in the whole year. Once they were transported and paid, the responsibility rested on the shoulders of the agent dealers. Of course, the bank had to open up another place specifically for them to be raised. A long row of wooden fences tied the deer one by one there. Green grass was the only food, which was hired to cut from the fields. They had to be fed four or five times a day. When feeding, two or three people had to give it separately, otherwise, if they saw grass on the other side, they would want to grab it, so the whole fence would be restless. In winter, the green grass was withered. At this time, wheat and sweet potato vines were mostly used instead. These deer also get sick. As long as you see them staying still and not eating anything, you should find a way to treat them; if they unfortunately die, you should immediately write a letter to notify the other party, and you must leave the entire skin and four feet of the deer as evidence, which is also to show your sincerity.</p>
<p>The way to sell deer is based on the weight. However, it also depends on how the sales are in the market and how many are transported. If the sales are good in the market and few are transported, they can naturally be sold at a good price; otherwise, few people will inquire about them. Therefore, it may cost one or two yuan per catty, or even less, it is hard to say. A deer can weigh as little as seventy or eighty catties on a balance scale, then it can always be sold for seventy or eighty yuan. Compared with the refugees in the disaster area who sell their children for a price of ten or twenty yuan and no one wants them, it can be said that people are not as good as beasts! Because each catty has a value, when both parties agree to deliver the goods, the buddies in those lines secretly and recklessly force the deer to eat the grass, and even mix stones in the grass in the wooden cage, hoping to increase the weight. In fact, how much weight can it add? It's really a despicable and ridiculous thing! Each buyer wants to buy a few, and there is no manipulation and monopoly. This point is commendable. At that time, the one with the largest sales volume was Hu Qingyutang in Hangzhou, which could sell dozens of them a year; followed by Ye Zhongdetang in Hangzhou. The rest could not match them, like a small wizard seeing a great wizard.</p>
<p>Each batch of deer was transported and sold, and the busy situation suddenly made the always quiet air lively. One by one the wooden cages containing deer were placed in the square, and many curious people gathered around, and some deliberately provoked them to joke. It is said that when deer are killed, they must also be sacrificed to the gods, hung up, and paraded around. The former is indeed a ridiculous superstitious act, while the latter is an advertisement to let everyone know that the products of a certain pharmacy do not deceive people with fake products.</p>
<p>In the past four or five years, because pirates have been rampant on the ocean, entire sailboats have often been kidnapped. If they are transported by steamship, the cost is too high, resulting in no profit. Moreover, due to the relationship of the boycott movement (Taiwan is no longer owned by our country. Naturally, it is the same example.) Therefore, deer from Taiwan are no longer transported and can be said to have disappeared. However, the main reason is that small-scale deer farms have been established in Lanxi and Cixi, Zhejiang, specifically for breeding. However, the sales of deer are not as good as before, which is also undeniable. Because deer is used as a tonic, you think, now there are many people who don't even have anything to eat, will they still think about tonics?</p>

<h3 id="e216">China's Wheat Industry Amidst Global Recession <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Bing</p>
<p>Wheat is not only the main food in northern China, but also an indispensable food in European and American countries. Therefore, when discussing life, Chinese people often talk about "rice bowls," while foreigners all say "bread." From this, it can be seen that wheat and flour are indeed a very noteworthy issue in the food problem.</p>
<p>People often mistakenly believe that only the north produces wheat because northerners eat noodles and southerners eat rice. Although the northern provinces are very rich in wheat production, there are also many places south of the Yangtze River that produce wheat. Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have an annual output of more than 30 million dan, which is not much less than Henan and Shandong, which are more important producing areas. Now, let's list the total wheat production of our country in the past three years as follows:</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20 389 million dan</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21 401</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 22 2290</p>
<p>This number seems quite impressive on the surface; but in reality, it is not. If we try to compare the number of foreign wheat exports in the past three years with the numbers listed above, we can see the seriousness of China's wheat production problem.</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 20 2.2 million dan</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 21 15</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 22 17</p>
<p>That is to say, although our country's wheat production is quite abundant, we still have to import 20 million dan (worth about 100 million yuan) of foreign wheat every year. This is such a painful fact!</p>
<p>Some domestic economic experts, because they see that our country imports 20 million dan of foreign wheat every year, superficially explain that "China's wheat production cannot be self-sufficient," which is completely nonsense. They only see the alarming amount of imports, but forget that this alarming amount is entirely because of the inconvenience of inland transportation, etc., so that the manufacturers in various commercial ports have to purchase foreign wheat.</p>
<p>At present, the farmers in China who grow wheat are facing the oppression of high-interest loans and exorbitant taxes on the one hand, and the blow of falling wheat prices on the other hand. Regarding the situation of high-interest loans and exorbitant taxes, let's put it aside for the time being. Now let's take a look at the actual situation of wheat prices.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the average value of domestic wheat was about five yuan per dan. Ten years ago, the average value was about six yuan, but recently, it is rare to see a market price that can exceed four yuan. In addition, with the gradual decline in the price of foreign wheat, domestic wheat has a tendency to become unrecoverable.</p>
<p>Although the price of domestic wheat is declining, because its quality is slightly worse, the flour industry still purchases foreign wheat. The result of purchasing foreign wheat in this way is that it has promoted a large amount of import surplus on the one hand, but has also hindered the sales of domestic wheat and lowered the price of domestic wheat on the other hand. Foreign wheat continues to pour in, and domestic wheat continues to decline. As a result, it has not only created a crisis for domestic wheat, but has also created a crisis for the domestic flour industry. We can understand this by just looking at the recent sharp decline in the sales of domestic flour and the sharp drop in its price.</p>
<p>The flour sold in Shanghai from January to March this year only accounted for 70% of the same period last year. The flour price also only accounted for 85% of the same period last year. The output even fell to 46% of the same period last year. If this continues, not only will the farmers have no place to sell and no way to live: even the manufacturers who run flour mills may find it difficult to live!</p>
<p>In order to save this terrible disaster, we believe that not only should the import tax on foreign wheat be increased, but also the improvement of the quality of domestic wheat, the abolition of exorbitant taxes, the prohibition of high-interest loans, the development of inland transportation, the encouragement of planting wheat fields, and the encouragement of using domestic wheat 　etc., must be given the greatest effort.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Research on Wireless Radio <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Researching wireless radio is one of my amateur pursuits. In recent years, most of my spare time has been dedicated to it. Although this work only started in the twenty-first year of the Republic [1932], I am confident that I have gained considerable knowledge of wireless radio in these short two or three years. During my research, failure and success have alternated. I failed in my first attempt, and failed again in the second, but I was able to approach it with an indomitable spirit, and ultimately success belonged to me. The more I failed, the more I tried to research; the more I researched, the more I enjoyed it. For several years, I have been immersed in it day and night, and my joy has been boundless. Therefore, I hope that others will also engage in this pursuit. I now offer my humble opinions on the benefits of researching wireless radio and its preliminary methods, hoping that they will be welcomed by those who aspire to conduct self-study?</p>
<p>Wireless radio is one of the emerging industries. It is still considered quite developed in our country. Although we cannot keep pace with Europe and the United States, we can still follow closely behind. Especially in recent years, there has been significant progress. Society has a very urgent need for wireless radio specialists. All kinds of ship radio stations, aviation radio stations, meteorological radio stations, military radio stations, commercial radio stations, broadcasting stations, and other related fields of wireless radio manufacturing, repair, and management have a great need for such talent. Therefore, those with wireless radio skills can easily find a foothold in today's society where there is more grain than monks. If someone has the ambition to run a business, they can also take advantage of the opportunity when this new industry has not yet fully developed in China to establish a new business. This would help the country promote the development of this new industry and allow individuals to make a living. It is truly a win-win situation. Even if one does not want to make wireless radio a fixed profession, but only uses a part of one's spare time to research it as a hobby, the mental effort and time spent are still worthwhile. When I used my own strength to assemble my first radio and heard music in the earphones, my joy was truly beyond that of a king ruling from the south. Moreover, countless experiences and knowledge can be gained from this.</p>
<p>To those who are unfamiliar with wireless radio, wireless radio machines are often considered a mysterious and unfathomable work of ingenuity. In reality, even those who are unlearned can research and enjoy it. I once saw a technician in a wireless radio shop who was initially just an apprentice in that shop, unaware of what wireless radio was, but now he is actually teaching others how to make it eloquently. When starting research, one should read more books and magazines, and at the same time purchase some components and prepare appropriate tools, then one can begin to experiment. Initially, one should make the simplest crystal radio, then a single vacuum tube radio, and then gradually increase the number of vacuum tubes; from using dry batteries to using household electricity; from longwave to shortwave; from radio receivers to transmitters. In short, one should progress from simple to complex, from easy to difficult, so that knowledge and experience will naturally advance step by step. One must not be ambitious and aim too high, lest one is at a loss when difficulties arise. As for the most accessible and practical wireless radio books, to my knowledge, there are the six volumes of "Introduction to Wireless Radio" published by the Chung Hwa Book Company, the "Wireless Radio Reader" published by Shen Bao, and the six volumes of "Science Series" sold by the Asia-America Company at No. 323 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. All are simple and practical. Even those who do not know what wireless radio is can follow them to manufacture it themselves after reading. After increasing experience and knowledge, one can then gradually seek further advanced study. There is no other way to advance study than to experiment more and read more books.</p>
<p>Wireless radio is one of China's emerging industries. Its progress and hope are truly endless, and it is very worthwhile for us to engage in. I hope that those who aspire to this field will catch up quickly and not be discouraged by "lacking this knowledge," then the writing of this article will not be in vain.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Drawing Water <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Manong</p>
<p>Changzhou Correspondence</p>
<p>This year, during the yellow plum season, there was no "plum rain," so farmers could only draw water to transplant rice seedlings. It takes five or six people to draw enough water to fill two or three mu of fields. As soon as the seedlings are transplanted, the water dries up. "Yellow seedlings" cannot withstand dryness, so they have to draw water again. The sun is scorching, and the dry soil around the fields absorbs too much water. Even if you add water, it won't last three days. The water dries up again, and the seedlings haven't taken root, so you have to add more. The river is shallow and the banks are steep, making it difficult to scoop water. It takes eighteen people to draw water for a whole day, and it's not enough to add a layer of water to two mu of rice fields. Therefore, this year, in the rice fields of Jiangnan, less than half can be transplanted. Three or four times more manpower than in previous years has been spent on drawing water to add water. Later, rivers, ponds, ditches, and dams successively dried up, leaving no water to draw. Even those that didn't dry up had to stop because it was too difficult to draw water. They put their energy, hope, and limited money into organizing a meeting to pray for rain. As the drought deepened, some blamed people for not being sincere, and others complained that the Bodhisattva was not effective. Millions of farmers held the same thoughts, facing the scorched earth of the "white fields" and the dry seedlings, which were scattered like the hair of a modern girl, with disappointment, anxiety, and worry. There were no sounds of waterwheels, no shouts of urging oxen. The entire countryside lay under an atmosphere of famine and death.</p>
<p>Recently, it has rained for a few days, but not much. The people hold onto the belief that "if it rains a little, it will rain more," and while the seedlings are still alive, they seize the opportunity to draw as much water as possible. They treat it like a mosquito net, sparing no expense to transport water from afar to the fields. So the waterwheels are working again.</p>
<p>Water wheels can be divided into several types according to their method of application. The ones that are cranked by hand are called small waterwheels. One type is cranked with both hands like punching, called a "punching waterwheel." The ones with a wider body that require two people to crank together up and down are called "dragon waterwheels." Large waterwheels are foot-operated, named according to the number of people needed to step on them, such as three-person waterwheels, Diamond waterwheels, six-person waterwheels, and nine-old-men waterwheels. The so-called Diamond waterwheel is a four-person waterwheel. The villagers avoid the number "four" because it sounds the same as "death," so they use the name Four Great Diamonds to replace it. The nine-person Nine Old Men waterwheel is the king of waterwheels. It is rarely used under normal circumstances unless it is a high water bank in such a severe drought as this year. In addition, there are ox-powered waterwheels, which are fixed waterwheels with mushroom-like thatched sheds covering the waterwheel banks. As for machine-powered waterwheels, because they are too expensive and have too many conditions, they are not yet very common in application.</p>
<p>Small waterwheels are almost completely ineffective this year. Along the long riverbanks, in the open spaces under the willow shade, you can see large waterwheels with six or nine people stepping on them, arranged like "connecting camps." In the struggle of sweating and swollen feet, the cries and the sound of the waterwheels miserably become a swan song, scaring the cicadas on the willow branches, making them dare not and unable to sing their high-pitched "I know, I know" song. Truly, the work on the axle is too difficult and arduous.</p>
<p>As soon as the east turns white, under the weary starlight, the water-drawing team starts work. The work allocation for a six-person waterwheel is: the two strongest men carry the heavy axle. The ones with sharp eyes and careful minds</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>

<p>Two people carry the long trough. In addition to the full trough of "Lianbi" [water-scooping leaves], they also have to carry hoes, iron shovels, and teapots, etc. The remaining two people are responsible for transporting stools, props, water ladders, straw curtains, and other equipment. A waterwheel is a rather complex machine, but the installation by a trained water-drawing team is quite scientific. Each person is transported to the destination, and everyone quickly divides the work and installs it. The two people who shovel the axle install the axle, pad the stools, drive in the props, and use the ropes and handrails [a straight, long fir wood] to carry the long trough, tie them to the props for everyone to lie on and step on the waterwheel. The people carrying the trough put the trough in place and connect the "dragon head Lianbi" to the gears of the axle, and put the water ladder into the water. The remaining two people use hoes to shovel and open the "dragon gate" [build a缺口], add lubricating oil to the rotating parts of the stools and axle, and spread the straw curtain on the props to provide shade. After the installation is complete, get on the waterwheel. The two people carrying the axle step on both ends of the axle, relying on the two sets of "footrests" of the props, called the left and right "front steps." The people carrying the scales occupy the left and right of the water gate where the dial teeth in the center of the axle and the Lianbi plate at the head of the trough are connected, called "holding the dragon gate." The remaining two people step on the empty space in the middle of the front step and the dragon gate, called the left and right "twisting silk steps." Twelve feet step together, of course, no one is allowed to be lazy and step in the air, but the two people stepping on the twisting silk steps are much easier. In addition to stepping with their feet, the people in the front steps must also pay attention to whether the props driven into the soil are strong and whether the rope knots tied to the handrails and straw curtains will break or loosen. The two people holding the dragon gate must pay attention to the depth of the water in the trough and whether the Lianbi leaves have problems with slipping or breaking. Because of the accumulated weight of six people, the water shock, and the wind attack, the waterwheel often has problems. The collapse of the prop is called "Taoluoshi," the rope break and the lever drop are called "Great New Year," and the Lianbi break is called "Returning the Dragon," which is often a dangerous accident that can kill people and damage the waterwheel. If such a danger occurs, then not only will they not get paid, but the boss will also hold the people in the front steps or dragon gate accountable based on the cause of the accident.</p>
<p>In such hot weather, it goes without saying how hot the water-drawing workers are who are working with their mouths, eyes, hands, and feet. The only way to avoid the heat is to draw water early. The team fixed for one waterwheel first installs the waterwheel the night before, and often goes to the waterwheel in the middle of the night, carrying their unrecovered fatigue and empty stomachs, and draws three or four hundred counts of water before dawn to come back for breakfast. The sparse straw curtain is not enough to provide any shade. The skin on their backs, which has been peeled off by the sun, is exposed to the poisonous sun, and their chests, which are covered with prickly heat, lie on the handrails. Their swollen feet stomp on the footrests one by one, and pus drips from the broken blisters on their feet, mixing with the sweat all over their bodies. The so-called "calluses on their hands and feet" cannot even begin to describe their hardship! Therefore, it is common on the waterwheel banks this year for people to suddenly fall from the handrails and die, or to lie down in the willow shade during rest and be unable to get up. Even the healthy ones who don't get sick on the spot can't lift their own legs when they go home at night to receive their wages and go to bed, and need their wives or sons to lift them. But if someone hires them to draw water tomorrow, they are still considered lucky. Alas, the cheap sale of labor and life in this year! Because there are so few opportunities to draw water due to the drought, there are more people than waterwheels. Therefore, the workers who work so hard to draw water all day only earn ten cents of silver.</p>
<p>Finally, I must say that drawing water is quite an artistic endeavor. They often use a primitive form of singing called "counting draws" to hope to forget a little of their fatigue. They nail a pair of white goose feathers to a Lianbi in the trough as a mark, called the "dragon head." When they start stepping on the waterwheel to turn the axle, everyone sings a sentence together in a tune that is only sound and whose meaning is no longer distinguishable. Then, the first person on the left or right sings a number according to the rotation of the dragon head, called "counting draws." When it reaches ten turns, the person counting the draws sings a tune asking the person on that end to "count the draws." Then, the person counting the draws sings a reply, and the whole team sings in unison. The person counting the draws sings another sentence, and the whole team sings in unison again. This is called "returning the draws." In this way, they continue to count down in order from the second person, and return and sing again after ten turns. Although the tune is monotonous and the sentences have no other meaningful content other than counting, the singing together and the alternating responses can indeed forget some of the pain of work. This is the origin and function of art! Because they have a number in mind as they step, they can sing the numbers without having to pay attention to the up and down movement of the dragon head. There are also those who beat drums and sing simple "flower drum opera tunes," which are mostly Hakka people from Hunan. There are also those who do not count or sing, but use a line wound on the waterwheel to count the draws.</p>
<p>According to official labor, one can stop after drawing one thousand and five counts of water every day. But in this severe drought this year, the bosses demand that they draw one thousand five hundred or six hundred counts, or even keep drawing all day without counting.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Odds and Ends from the Summer Training Course by Lu Menghen <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau's Second Summer Training Course was held from July 9th to July 21st, totaling two weeks. Despite the hot weather, about 200 elementary school teachers from private schools registered to participate. During these two weeks, I saw and heard many interesting things. Now I will write down some odds and ends from the meeting, which may be enough to relieve the readers' boredom in their spare time.</p>
<p>Most of the trainees in the training course are between the ages of 20 and 40. The most distinctive is an old man over 60 years old, with white hair and beard, who still comes to listen to the lectures. When the lecturer says a sentence, he nods his head, seeming to listen with great interest. There is also a girl, about 16 years old, still childish, jumping and eating her chewing gum, which is a fun contrast with the old man's white hair and red face.</p>
<p>The venue is located in Wuben Girls' Middle School on Huangjiaque Road in Ximen, but most of the trainees live in Hongkou. The journey is so far that they can only take the tram instead of walking. Taking the tram is essential to having coppers. When packing coppers in newspaper, the paper often breaks. So during the lecture, you can often hear the sound of copper falling to the ground. A joker said, "This is a big spend of money."</p>
<p>Special lectures are held every day from 1:30 PM to 5:30 PM, and the association invites celebrities from Shanghai to give lectures. That day was probably the 12th. The association invited Mr. Li Tingan, the director of the Health Bureau, to give a lecture on "Education and Hygiene." Director Li arrived at the meeting at 1:45. Before the lecture, Director Li first explained the reason for his late arrival. He said: "Now we are implementing the New Life Movement, and appointments must be kept on time. I have always been the most punctual. Today, because my watch was broken, I didn't know the time. I rushed to buy a new watch and came, but I didn't know that I was 15 minutes late." After he said that, he took out his new watch for everyone to see. All the trainees laughed.</p>
<p>The lecturers hired by the association are all university professors and writers. They either wear robes or suits. Only Mr. Shao Shuangqiu, the dean of the Education College of Daxia University, who teaches the subject of "Elementary School Organization and Administration," is not constrained by small matters and comes to the lecture hall wearing short clothes and pants. There is already a fan behind the platform on the platform, but the old gentleman is fanning in front with a big fan. Perhaps because the old gentleman is fat and afraid of heat, he needs to cool off both in front and behind.</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been hot. In addition, all the trainees come early to listen to the lectures. In the afternoon, most of them look tired and sleepy. If there is no vigilance and interest, it is necessary to remind people's spirits. No matter how interesting the lecturer says, the listeners are scarce, and they are doing their sleepiness. "Elementary School Multi-Grade Teaching Method" is taught by Mr. Wei Bingxin, the editor of the World Book Company. Mr. Wei, in order to remind everyone's spirit, said a joke: "The multi-grade teaching method is not very popular now, just like old antiques. To cater to the trend, we should teach modern things. Old antiques must be modernized, like an old woman with chicken skin and white hair, wearing fashionable clothes and high-heeled leather shoes." All the trainees laughed after hearing these jokes, like they had been injected with morphine, and they really perked up.</p>
<p>There are many other interesting things, but because of the limited space, I have to omit them.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Scientific Industry Talks About the Story of the Invention of Airships (8) Shulin <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>When Huboto was dying, Zeppelin sat beside his bed, holding his hand tightly.</p>
<p>The younger brother also held the elder brother's hand tightly, looking at his face, but his eyes were already scattered. He said in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Brother...airship...Brother...airship..."</p>
<p>These were Huboto's last words, spoken intermittently, and then he passed away.</p>
<p>Zeppelin, with his white hair fluttering, was devastated, and the whole family could not help but weep quietly.</p>
<p>If Huboto had been given time, helping his brother day and night to engage in the production of airships, perhaps he would have been able to fly and swim leisurely on Lake Constance! At that time, how overjoyed and immersed in the encouragement of life would Huboto have been! But in the middle of his career, he passed away!</p>
<p>However, Huboto's death was not without meaning.</p>
<p>The world began to pay attention to Zeppelin's career. They invested their efforts. The world also gradually had considerable respect for Zeppelin's career, for which his younger brother sacrificed.</p>
<p>"For the airship..." "For the new German airship..." "To commemorate Huboto's airship..."</p>
<p>Under this name, the world worked hard to invest, and Zeppelin suddenly gathered huge sums of money in his hands.</p>
<p>In addition, Emperor Wilhelm of Germany at that time also focused on Zeppelin's airship, believing that it would serve the empire in the future, and assisted with huge funds as a public advocate, and even built a hangar and engine.</p>
<p>Zeppelin's courage greatly increased, and he resumed the manufacture of the airship. After several failures, he completed the completely Zeppelin-style airship. (To be continued)</p>
