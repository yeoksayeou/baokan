<h3 id="c12">最近一年來世界經濟大勢之回顧（上）桐· <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>試檢過去最近一年間。世界經濟所經歷之過程。一言以蔽之。所謂入於極衰沉之時期。蓋自世界經濟會議决裂以後。各國之經濟政策。遂分道揚鑣。各走極端途徑。循至各國相率採行封鎖經濟政策。使此項政策。頓成爲時代之驕兒。於是所謂關稅戰爭也。排貨運動也。凡可以有利於本國之產業。而排斥他國經濟勢力这侵入者。靡不行之。自此封鎖經濟之組織。益形嚴密。如英國曾召集出席世界經濟會議之所屬各殖民地代表。舉行帝國會議。重行確認沃太華恊定。可見其努力於封鎖經濟之情况矣。又荷蘭亦放棄其自由貿易主義。而置荷屬東印度於本國經濟之統制下。美國亦爲締結新通商條約起見。曾聯絡南美各國。與之合作。此皆爲明顯之例。於是就其影響所及於各國之國内方面。可得而言者。（一）爲產業界之活動。蓋自世界經濟會議决裂以後。各國均繼續實施其自認爲最適合於國民經濟實際上之政策。一方以低利之金融政策爲輔。造成物價之騰貴。使產業界頓趨活潑。如各國之基礎的鋼鐵工業生產數量。均見增加。此一例也。（二）爲物價之騰貴。物價變動之狀態。各國稍有不同。在金本位貨幣制度存在之國家。較爲軟弱。至巳於棄之國家。則較堅强。就世界之全體大勢而言。在一九三三年下半期。趨於顯著之騰貴。迨入一九三四年。仍未見變化。物價之騰貴。無非爲膨脹金融及處置積貨之一種繁榮政策。間接卽所以助進農業國及一般農民之購買力。故反映於購買力之增進者。其基調若謂爲經濟的。母寗謂爲政治的。茲以世界各主要國之情勢言之。</p>
<p>農業國方面。一般農民所受因經濟衰頽之影響而成極度疲困狀態。在一九三三年之下期。爲最高潮時代。嗣後以物價之騰貴。隨趨緩和。徵之美國。當一九二九年之金融大恐慌時始。以至一九三二年十二月。農產物之跌價。竟逹面分之六十。雖政府方面。急藉復興運動。實施其積極的農業救濟政策。然仍在百分之二十左右。蓋農產物品。尤以如　類之價格。欲以政治的理由。謀提高至一般物價之水凖以上。至屬不易。試觀美國之救農運動。其積極之努力程度。巳昭昭顯示於吾人。然所獲效果。猶微小若此。是春他各國之農村經濟狀况。更易於揣想矣。</p>
<p>世界之一般經濟。在最近旣顯示物價騰貴及產業界活動之現象。則就原理言。商品貿易。宜有發展之望。顧事實所告人者。又大謬不然。蓋各國在内部方面欲圖實現其封鎖經濟政策之完密乃。積極提倡生產。鼓　輸出。對外則互設關稅壁壘。排斥他國貨品。國際貿易。處於此種經濟障碍重之形勢下。惟有日趨萎縮而巳。一九三三年之國際貿易。輸出爲一百二十億美金元。輸入爲一百零八億美金元。較之上年度輸出减少百分之五·六。輸入减少百分之二二·三本年度雖尙未有正式統計可考。然揆情度勢。恐亦未必有若何良好之成績也。</p>

<p>（東京）　日本政府於二十九日午後發表廢除華府條約旨趣於左、日本政府此次在海軍軍縮豫備交涉之際、與關係各國恊力以期日本國防之鞏固、而圖充分發揮軍縮之實績、以便成立公正妥當之新恊定、且可以之免除大海軍國間之威脅侵略、同時希望盡量减輕國民之負担、日本政府由此項見解、關於可作新軍縮恊定之根幹各點、處以愼重考究結果、乃决定下列各端、</p>
<p>（一）旣存海軍條約、認爲係以大海軍國間兵力不平等之方式而成者、參照艦船兵器及航空飛機等等進步現狀、得悉上項方式萬難確保今後日本國防之鞏固、故應在新軍縮恊定上、將上項比率主義換以各國能保有兵力之共同最大限度、使之作爲恊定之方式、</p>
<p>（二）（甲）爲發揮軍精神起見、須將上項限度極力使之縮少、（乙）同時爲使各國難攻易守起見、應將攻擊上之兵力全然廢除、或極力縮少、而整備其防衛上之兵力、遵照上項要旨、以圖訂立新約、當屬與軍縮本意最相符合、且能以之確保各國國防之永久鞏固、此乃日本方面之根本主張、並以之表示於關係各國者也、然華盛頓軍備限制條約、非僅將日本政府企圖全廢之專事攻擊諸艦船種類認爲保有、且以比率主義規定大海軍國間之兵力不平等、故該條約之存續、實爲日本政府依照根本方針萬難容認者也、至以劣等比率被其規律、更屬傷日本國民之自尊心、是以永遠對於國民未能給與满足矣、故日本政府今俟該條約在昭和十一年年底、卽該條約所規定之最初有效期限現巳逹到、同時認爲廢除之適當時期、遵照該條約所規定、故於本年年底爲止、應將廢除之意有行使通告之必要、上項日本政府之意向、早經將大致情形豫行通知英美方面、但因日本方面希望此次預備交涉、盡力使之有效而作發生效果之圖、故擬竭誠與關係各國恊同行使該項廢約通告、然後更從而恊力促或訂立新約、方可認爲適當、因此日本政府曾對於關係各國全體說明上項緣由、並勸其設法共同通告廢約、但各國均未同意、今則日本政府單獨將廢除華盛頓海軍條約之意、根據該條約第二十三條所規定、决定用書面通告美國政府、此其由來也、查上項廢約通告旣由該條約明白規定在案、則各訂約國在條約上所有之權利、巳屬明顯、自母等言、關於廢除華盛頓條約之日本政府此次之措置、係除該條約以外、期待訂立最公正妥當而最合乎軍縮精神之新約、乃爲上項日本方面依照根本方針之當然歸結耳、日本政府雖經通告廢除該項條約以後、固仍豫備與關係各國作友誼上之商議、以圖公正合理之新恊定得以成立、此爲衷心希望而不巳者也、至於進謀軍擴或害及國際和平諸如是類之意圖、毫非日本夢想所及之處、卽於日本方面要求全廢或大加縮少攻擊上之艦船、以期確立不威脅不侵略之原則、當巳洞悉其用意、倘關係各國虚心坦懷、對於此點加以三思、必能了解日本提案之妥當、因此各國果能同意全廢攻擊上之艦船、或因大加縮少而現有勢力因而大减、同時能將其保有兵力之共同最大限度得以恊定、則各國當不被任何國所威脅、而確保其安全感矣、事勢至此、方可雜立永久和平關係、此爲日本政府所確信者也云云、（二十九日日聯電）</p>

<p>— 鄭西谷</p>
<p>本校新校舍·今日欣觀厥成。囘溯建築經過，得省市政府社會人士學生家長與全校師生之助力實多。飲水思源·感奮無旣！</p>
<p>茲叙述本校此次遷地改建之經過·及新校舍照片·彙編斯刊·以告我贊助本校發展之各界人士·諒亦爲各界人士所樂聞。</p>
<p>惟新校舍之落成·祇可謂物質建設，告一段落。至於精神土之建設，如學校内容之充實　社會改進事業之推行等，尚有待於省市政府社會人士之督促指導，與夫在校師生之繼續努力也。則斯刊之編印，亦紀念過去，策勸來茲之意云爾</p>
<h3 id="c198">本校新校舍建築經過 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>本校於上六年改組後，卽感校地校舍，不能適用，影響於敎學，訓練及行政效率者，至重用大。爰擬訂遷地建築計劃，經七年積極之進日，始克完成。茲將經過情形，分述於下··</p>
<p>（一）遷校原因</p>
<p>一、校地狹小　本校初中部在小西門内尙文路，計有校地二十三畝一分四厘九毫，高中部在小南門外陸家浜路，計有校地十八畝四分六厘四毫、合計共四十一畝六分一厘三毫，當改組時，學生僅七八百人，巳感侷促，近年學生日增，更覺狹小，無地可容，旣無校園可供遊散、曳　操場足供運動，如欲添建房屋　　無隙　，若增購校地，則地價昂貴，抑且不易購得，故欲使上中發展，非遷地不可。</p>
<p>二、校舍破敗　本校初中校舍，原爲　　書院舊址，故有一部房屋巳建築逹一二百　之久，其餘雖在前二師時代添建，除三樓敎室一幢外，其餘如宿舍圖書室儀器室等均破舊不　　　塌堪處，雖年費鉅欵修　，仍不能應　，高中校舍原爲圖書公司舊址，建築迄今亦三　餘年，觀雖頗巍峨，但均不適於學校之川，且兩部校舍均無適當之禮堂圖書館實驗室　，以供全校師生集會研究之用，故新校舍之建　，又　容緩</p>
<p>三、校舍分設　本校高初中兩部向分兩處，雖相開不遠，交通尙便，俱學校用費，等於兩校，兩部師生亦不易聯絡，學校行政政旣感困雖，學校情神亦頗　影響。</p>
<p>四、環境囂塵　本校高初中部均在熱　市區，鄰近爲商店工廠，車馬往來，聲浪嘈雜，炭灰塵埃，空氣至爲不潔，旣有碍於衛生，且不適於讀書及訓練。</p>
<p>有此四因，故本校鄭校長於十六年搂改組之後，擬訂全校計劃綱要時，卽主張遷地改建，爲上中樹百年之基，而成爲一完善之中學也。</p>
<p>（二）進行情形</p>
<p>一·萌芽時期十六年秋至十八年秋</p>
<p>本校自十六年秋計劃遷地改建後，一方以學改組伊始，維持整頓，使入正軌，幾佔全部時間與精力，尙無暇以言發展，一方以茲事體大，除全校師生校友外，又須賴官廳及社會人士之明瞭，予以贊助耳。</p>
<p>二·醖釀時期十八年秋至十九年夏　本校於十八年秋，將遷校理由及遷校計劃詳細擬具，並草訂新校舍計劃圖及新校舍分期建築辦法，分别呈請江蘇省政府及江蘇敎育廳，當由省政府及敎育廳决定提交江蘇敎育經費委員會討論，經敎費委員會正式議决通過，並交敎育廳會同本交進行，於是本校遷地改建計劃，於官廳方面始經正式核准矣。</p>
<p>三·停頓時期十九年夏至二十一年夏</p>
<p>本校遷地改建，旣經敎費委員會通過後·卽擬着手進行·初適有省市管轄問題之爭·嗣又有水災爲患·九一八一二八國難發生·致二年間遷校計割·未能進行·殊引爲憾也·</p>
<p>四·發動時期廿一年夏至二十二年春</p>
<p>自周廳長主持蘇省敎育後，銳意改進，不遺餘力，本校卽將二年來停頓之遷校計劃，又呈請進行，深荷贊助，當時又有省市管轄問題之議，故由省政府再將本校遷校理由及遷校計劃，轉呈行政院，當由行政院通過，令飭省政府負責主持進行，遂由省政府及敎育廳組織江蘇省立上海中學新校舍改建委員會，聘請省政府代表一人，（由省政府委託上海縣長代表）省敎育廳向復庵薛翹東二科長，本校鄭校長及地方人士鈕惕生潘公展王志莘三先生爲委員，並指定本校鄭校長爲主任委員，共同計劃並執行本校遷校改建事宜，於是本校遷校改建計劃，行順利進行矣，</p>
<p>五·進行時期二十二年春至廿三年秋</p>
<p>自　十二年一月七日新校舍改建委員會第一次會議後對於遷地改建積極進行，計一年半中，先後舉行改建委員會十次，舊校地校舍估價委員會一次，茲將進行事項，分述於下，</p>
<p>a·領取士地執業證</p>
<p>本校因欲標售舊校地校舍，將售得这欵，另行購地建築，故初步進行，卽函請上海市土地局發給土地執業證，以便着手標售，計自二十一年五月起，迄二十二年八月底止，爲時一年又四月，始正式領得，初以文量校地，清理舊田單舊糧申，並補納二十一年以前歷年田稅閱時頗久，後又爲省市管轄問題，土地局不允發給，嗣又有市農會及區農會阻止出售前先棉祠基地，鄭校長先後與市政府敎育局土地局接洽者逹數十次之多，後承吳市長潘局長金局長之贊助，由市府令土地敎育財政工務四局會商發給土地執業證事，並令土地敎育社會三局會同本校商訂紀念先棉祠辦法後，始於八月底領行高初中兩部土地執業證矣，</p>
<p>b·標售舊校地校舍</p>
<p>本校於領行土地執業證後，卽遵新校舍改建委員會决議，由敎育廳函請新華銀行代爲標售舊校地校舍，先期由委員會推請顧馨一曹振飛潘公展王志莘鄭西谷五先生曁土地局工務局代表各一人，組織估價委員會，討論高初中校地及校舍之最低標價，並由改建委員會修訂標購規則，登報招標，越二月，無應標者實以年來受時局影響，商業方面頓呈不景氣之景象，而本校校地面積又較廣，遂無人顧問矣。嗣有上海内地地產公司姚慕蓮陸伯鴻張效良諸先生，贊助本校遷建計劃，卽以四十三萬六千七百餘元標購兩部舊校地，復於二十三年七月以一千五百元標購兩部舊校舍，於是標售舊校地校舍問題，始告結束矣。</p>
<p>c·擇定並圈購新校址</p>
<p>本校於計劃遷地改建時，卽注意新校址之選擇，同時向市區附近各地尋覓，似覺滬南一帶，較爲適宜，當第一次新校舍改建委員會開會時、卽議决擇定新校址原則四項如下（一）地價經濟，（二）交通便利，（三）環境適宜，（四）面積在三百畝至五百畝，且有發展可能，旋卽由各委員親赴鄕間察看，擇定漕涇區中國公墓對面基地四百五十畝爲新校址，二十二年四月間，卽按照土地徵收法，呈請省敎育廳，轉呈省政府，轉咨内政部，當由内政部咨復准予圈購，並附發公告一紙，並由省政府咨請市政府令飭土地局恊助圈購，由土地局測繪詳圖，調杳原業主姓名曁畝分登報公告，同時又承漕涇區市政委員楊福元先生恊助進行，自二十三年一月起進行圈購，每畝地價爲二百元，沿滬閔路者每畝加價一百元，越二月巳圈購十之九，同時校基上有村落二，計屋四十間，坟墓甚多，計棺千餘柩，當卽精鄕民遷讓，計遷屋者，每間津貼二百元。遷坟者每柩津貼五元十元，或二十元不等，本校夙以恊助農民改進農付爲職志，故對於農民之遷屋遷坟津貼，均按最公允之價值会給，故附近居民，對於本校，莫不愛戴。</p>
<p>d·建築新校舍</p>
<p>本校新校舍建築計畫，於十七年秋，卽巳擬訂，另擬建築預算，延請戚鳴鶴建築師設計繪圖，仍託新華銀行招標承造，中標者爲上海治昌泰營造廠，計造龍門樓一座，先棉堂一座、禮堂一座，學生宿舍四座，食堂二座，銀行一座，消費合作社一座，醫院一座，體育館一座，敎職員往宅七座，水塔一座，及大門門房，全部建築等費共四十六萬六千元，嗣又添建小學一座，工廠一座，計三萬二千元，其中除平房數座外，全係鋼骨水泥建築，二十三年三月十五日興工，五月十九日舉行奠基典禮，原定八月底竣工，嗣以工程浩大，延至十月中工竣，而本校亦於是月杪全部遷入新校含矣，茲附建築經費槪算表於下··</p>

<p>六、完成時期｜二十三年冬</p>
<p>本校新校舍自二十三年三月興工以來工程進行頗稱順利，至十月中竣工。所有自來水電燈電話以及衛生設備，亦均裝置完備。校前函請市政府特設公安局派出所，校内函請郵政管理局特設郵政代辦所，一切生活，均甚安適，而風景幽雅，空氣清新，遠非塵囂这城市所能比擬。本校全部卽于是月二十八日起遷入新校舍矣。七年來計劃經營之遷地建築校舍，足賴鄭校長之努力奮門，省市當局社會人士及敎職員校友學生等之羣策羣力，至此始得觀厥成。並擇於十二月二十九日　行新校舍落成典禮，以慶祝新校舍之落成。</p>
<p>（三）將來計劃</p>
<p>本校初步建築計劃，雖告完成，但今後進行，千頭萬緒，各事之有待舉辦者，實難盡列。茲就添建校舍與辦理農村改進兩端，略述子下··</p>
<p>一、添建校舍　本校此次建築、僅屬初步計劃之完成，今後五年内尙擬絡續添造下列各種建築··</p>
<p>科學館一座　　八萬元</p>
<p>圖書館一座　　六萬元</p>
<p>游泳池　　　　一萬元</p>
<p>女生宿舍一座　二萬元</p>
<p>敎職員宿舍一座　二萬元</p>
<p>學生課外作業室一座　一萬元</p>
<p>二、辦理農村改進　本校本敎育卽生活，學校卽社會之旨，使學校一切設施與社會生活打成一片，並使學校成爲改造社會之中心，故擬試辦農村改進實驗區，先從小範園做起，俟有成績當逐步推廣。實驗區域以四週離校各五里爲範圍，面積約八十方里。第一步擬先舉辦實驗區内各項調查，如敎育調查，經濟調查風俗習慣調查等。次卽根據調查結果，實施下列各項事業</p>
<p>A普及敎育　普及敎育從義務敎育與民衆敎育二方百入手，聯絡上海市縣敎育局恊同進行，在實驗區内設立小學招收學齡兒童，設立民衆學校，招收失學成人，由本校師生輪流擔任敎學訓導及一切校務並設巡迴指導員負責指導。</p>
<p>B改進農業　於本校新址劃百畝爲農</p>
<p>場，聘請農業專門人才主其事，並聯絡中央大學及金陵大學之農事試驗場，取其試驗後所得之優良種子試行新法種植，更以所行新種子推廣於農民。而以農民補習學校爲灌輸農事智識之所。農民補習學校附設於農場招收十四歲至廿歳之小農民，除施以秘要之公民訓練外，尤注重農業智識之灌輸，與農業技術之訓練，以四年爲期，每日有二小時至四小時之敎學與實習時間，其主旨在養成最有效率之健全農民。</p>
<p>C提倡農村副產　爲救濟農村凋弊起見提倡農村副產，亦係切要之圖，如養鷄，養鴨，養蜂，畜豬，畜羊，畜牛···，及利用隙地，種植菓樹花木等，旣易舉辦，利益亦頗優厚。</p>
<p>D舉辦信用合作　目前農村經濟，萬分竭　，貧農常以經濟困難，坐失農時，故信用合作，實爲急切要圖。本校銀行今後擬擴充服務範圍，兼辦農村信用合作事業，凡實驗區内農民皆得向銀行借欵，利息年利一分，不取任何手續費，手續極簡單，祇須農民互相連保，經調查確實無惡劣嗜好者，卽准予借欵。</p>
<p>E舉辦消費合作　爲農民日用物品之購買計，本報聯絡農民，合組消費合作社。設一主任，並由校中商科學生輪流服務。消費者皆爲股東，每股一元儘量收受農民之股份，出售物品，取利至薄，年終結賑一次，如有贏餘，半數分給股東，半數充社會事業費。</p>
<p>F提倡公共衛生　本校校醫原爲便利在校師生之治療疾病而設，今後擬添聘醫師及助手兼爲實驗區内農民治病，不收醫費，貧苦者且施送樂品，尤注意疾疫之預防，如佈種半痘，注射防疫針等，均由校醫主持之。學生方面，利用假日，從事清潔街道，撲滅蠅類等衛生工作。</p>
<p>G修築道路　爲便利農村交通計，本校與實驗區内各村莊須有一丈寛之道路，由本校師生聯合農民共同修築。築路之前，先由校中師生宣傳築路之意義與重要，以免發生阻力。俟經濟充裕時，路上冉加舗煤屑或石子，以便雨天來往。</p>
<p>H辦理保衛團　本校高中學生實施軍事訓練，歷有年所。今後擬注重野外演習，兼負保衛地方之責，以引起農民之注意並逐漸聯絡農民加入隊伍，編成保衛團，卽由本校軍事敎官負責敎練，學生恊助團務之處理，而團員則農民與學生參半，以後學生日漸退出，農民逐漸加入，使成一純粹農民組織之保衛團。</p>
<p>茲值新校舍落成之時，爰將本校遷地改建原因，及進行情形今後計書等約略述之，幸社會人士，有以敎之焉。</p>

<p>巋然新宫，實吾母校！鳥革翬飛，旣完且好。地近江村，狂塵不到，時有樵風，送此歌嘯。菁莪育材，木鐸埀敎，濟濟俊髦，桃李炳耀。愷悌君子，維神所勞；革故鼎新，民則以傚。吾輩及門，未窺堂奥；　舍落成，握管含笑。雲物四時，信具衆妙，雨露無私，日月長照。</p>

<p>體育消息　李震中　一柱難擎天</p>
<h3 id="c209">國體敗於西青海賊 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>五九比三芋相差二十二</p>
<p>造詣尙未深心有力不足</p>
<p>希望國體努力誓滅此賊</p>
<p>不上高山、焉知平地、觀中央國術體專籃球隊之戰勝大同與東亞、眞如風捲殘葉、一無阻擋、但再觀昨晚與西青海賊一戰、猶不能令人满意、戰略平常、造詣不深、全隊旣無聯絡、又不能利用方法、亂打亂擲、全憑各人技術、李震中鶴立鷄羣、徒然作其個别之表演而巳、或攻或守、疲於奔命、誠所謂能者多勞、局勢初甚緊張、但國體始終屈居下風、初則緊緊追隨、終則一敗塗地、上半時二十四比十八、總結果五十九比三十七、</p>
<h3 id="c210">西青市利三倍 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>海賊在滬、横行無阻、西青籃球僵中之各華隊、均非其敵、此次國體來滬、以爲可以一擊、故昨晚之戰、慕名往觀者、十分踴躍、西青籃球房中、樓上樓下、擠得水洩不通、而嗜閉門羹者、猶不知其數、以地位統計、當在一千左右、爲本季籃球賽第一次盛况、一元及五角之票價、猶不覺昂貴也、</p>
<h3 id="c211">海賊確實厲害 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>海賊之奮鬥精神、確可佩服、行動敏捷、傳遞巧妙、瞬息萬變、不可捉摸、史密斯之角球、百發百中、且空心穿入、不觸籃筐、歎觀止焉、卡爾遜與史規亞、驃惶非凡、無孔不入、長人蘭英、雖覺呆笨、但高球搶刦、必須此人、李震中亦因以不能十分活動、戒備之嚴、使國體從無籃下投擲之機會、</p>
<h3 id="c212">國體致命之傷 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>國體因塲地生疏、實力上必須打一折扣、然防禦不嚴、實爲致命之傷、吳文忠高長明尙嫌矮小、更以不能呼應、時露破故綻、史密斯之得以横行無阻也、李惠中見勢不佳、不得不退後助守板上彈回之球、全憑李君搶刦前攻、張氏昆仲、一籌莫展、總之、全隊工夫尙未到家、戰略上尙須多多注意、動作遲滯、尤爲大病、</p>
<h3 id="c213">從此屈居人下 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>開始後變方均不敢造次行動、形勢異常緊張、西青因罰球連得二分、李震中遙射中的、采聲雷鳴、張長江因卡爾遜之犯規、加上一分、以三比二佔優、卡爾遜造成三比三、張長清得罰球再以四比三導前、即此之後、國體屈居人下矣、但有追隨之力、而無再露角之機會、史密斯史規亞雙管齊下、以七比四領導、國體宣告暫停時間、</p>
<h3 id="c214">西青佔先六分 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>高長明竄前打中、相差一分、力圖打開僵局、奈何無隙可入、盤旋於塲之中央、不能深入禁地、史密斯打家刦寨、又中兩球、十二比六之後、吳文忠亦還敬兩只、满望登峯造極、無如事與願違、　時間蘭英卡遜連得七分之多、成十九比十、李震中見機不妙、自告奮勇、一次偶然得入籃下、一投中的、半塲遙射又中鵠的、風勢似有轉機、忽然二次叫休、從此比數逐漸遠離、上半時終了、二十四比十八、西青勝六分、</p>
<h3 id="c215">祇苦了李震中 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>球賽至此、優勝劣敗、似巳内定、但所希望國體者、能於下半時中忽來一個下馬威、作一番驚天動地之舉、終以陣容不見振作、心有餘而力不足耳、再戰聲起、海賊依然如故、國體愈形不振、得不償失、前五分鐘内、比數仍差六分、二十六比二十、二十八比二十二、三十比二十四、此後即爲三十五比二十六、李震中不甘示弱、忽而攻、忽而守、勞而無怨、但史密斯角求連中、史規亞亦脫離覊拌、十分猖狂、比數一躍而成五十一比二十八、相差二十三分之多、此爲全局比數最大之時、</p>
<h3 id="c216">無法再挽狂瀾 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>西青巳穩操勝劵、老將沙利文調上、局勢漸見鬆懈、高長明張長清李震中、各有投中、無如狂瀾旣倒、挽救乏術、最後結果西青五十九分、國體三十七分、史密斯獨得二十六分之多、李震中得十六分、以後兩隊尙須會師一次、希望國體努力赴之、一雪昨夕之恨、</p>

<p>門將陳而德　前年天津埠際隊七比一大勝上海、上海門將周賢言、天津隊是陳而德、那天他確是救了不少的險球、於是乎名满全國、與周賢言媲美、外號人稱「小猴子」、</p>
<p>右衛王寳香　提起「楞王」二字在天津是大大有名、所調「楞」者就是什麽都不怕的意思、衝球截球是他唯一的特長、頭球也行有工夫、天当中華隊的後衛就是他、</p>

<p>二與一之比</p>
<p>平庸不足爲奇之英尼斯足球隊、昨突露鋒芒、以二比一擊敗優游、此爲西聯甲組賽、久雨初晴、逸圜塲地濘滑、行動頗不自由、優游前鋒散漫、動作遲滯、幸防禦堅固、保守得法、僅負一球、更以張榮標之守門、胆大心細、救出險球無數、博得掌聲不少、</p>
<h3 id="c221">守門尙稱得法 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>英尼斯聯絡美妙、奔跑迅速、前鋒個個出色、守衛無懈可擊、全隊一致、美技百出、攻勢極盛、幸而新將張榮標、把門得法、江善敬戒備森嚴、屢退雄兵、前鋒一無可取、散漫無狀、上半時造成一比二後、下半時各無建樹、雙方表演、亦遠不如前三刻鐘之精彩矣、</p>
<h3 id="c222">龍門先告陷落 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>英尼斯開球先攻、三分鐘内、康培爾兵臨城下、直逹優游門邊底綫、王樹森阻之不及、竟被其横射入門、神妙之至、繼之英尼斯右翼又送角球、前鋒圍射不進、聲勢之盛、爲之咋舌、而優游前鋒躡乎躡足、頗不如意、孫錦順偶然得球、斬關而入、直逹無人之境、英尼斯左内衛火速追至、老孫即向門撥去、不料過偏不中、</p>
<h3 id="c223">救出十二碼球 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>觀衆目擊老孫交臂失機、嘆惜萬分、不料禍不單行、羅海光在自己門前犯乎球、被罰十二碼、敵軍左内衛主踢、正中門中、射在守門身上、遂被守門救出、徼倖得險、喜出望外、然英尼斯聲勢極盛、優游門前、密佈敵人踪跡、江王二衛及守門張君救出險球不少、</p>
<h3 id="c224">敵球聯珠而來 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>陸志明久靜思動、逼得角球、送出雖佳、一無成就、雲逢　在敵人脚傍、搶球送出、勇森帶前、深入敵軍腹地、傳至門前、孫錦順在越位地位打中不算、後方忽又受敵、康培爾傳球到前、張榮標離門撲空、敵中鋒對空門頭頂、幸觸横木而回、李省官一脚救出、但敵軍氣焰萬丈、聯珠箭射、危險萬分、</p>
<h3 id="c225">依舊屈居下風 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>羅海光忽在亂軍中救出阿斗、兼程盤進、交與勇森、再傳與王南珍、王帶前數步、仍還至門前、孫羅被阻、陸志明如飛追至、斜射中鵠、脚頭硬勁　美麗可喜　歡聲未巳、敵軍哥納爾躱過雲逢狄、寫寫意意、射入一球、成二比一、優游仍居下風、</p>
<h3 id="c226">形勢反較鬆弛 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>上半時過後、形勢反較鬆弛、孫錦順在敵門前廿碼處罰任意球無效、英尼斯因在優游嚴防之下、射門機會極少、更以脚頭不準、一無成就、托姆遜曾力射一球、由柱上彈回、優游報復心切、雄心勃勃、但一以幸運不佳、一以陣容散漫、屢失戎機、羅海光曾側射一球、軟弱無力、陸志明亦射一球、亦未命中、</p>
<h3 id="c227">優游益形不振 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>後來鍾勇森傷腿、改任翼子、陸志明任内鋒、未幾梁樹棠升任有内鋒、陸改任内衛、而王樹森則代梁任前衛、陳綫益爲不振、往來馳騁、雙方均無特殊發展、徒勞往返、一事無成、最後敵軍哥納爾在優游門前、偷空射門、一飛冲天、令入飽受虚驚、</p>

<p>市敎育局潘局長致詞、略謂方才聽到周廳長、吳市長代表章先生演說、對於要做標準青年、須從體格上、智識上、人格上培養、本人尙有一些意見補充、第一、青年除了體格、人格、智識上培養以外、同時須有一種民族精神、及一種時代精神、民族精神是縱的、有歷史的關係、時代精神是横的、有地理的關係、從這兩種精神培養出來的青年、才是中國需要的青年、再敎育應有一貫的目標、標準學生、是從校長敎職員規矩準繩之下所造成出來的、所以師資問題、甚爲重要、胡適熶近有一種議論說、青年應該自己去摸索、盲從十年摸索、可以找出一條路來、又說、中國青年到二十歲時、假使不相信馬克思主義、没有出息、到了三十歲時、相信馬克思主義、也是没出息、此種狂妄議論敎人無從說起、希望土中學生在標準敎師領導之下、將來進了火學時、切不可盲從此等大學敎授之言論也云云、</p>

<p>市社會局長吳醒亞致詞、略謂適才幾位先生講的不外是體格、人格、智識的修養、同時青年要有民族精神、時代精神、尤其不可亡從大學敎授狂妄的言論、甚爲要緊、因應接受諸先生的意見、但本人以爲最要緊先恢復民族自信力、青年處在現今代、不應講空話、應從根本做起、諸位先生巳講到很詳盡、近年來復興民族的口號瀰漫全國、要復興中華民族、建設新的中國、此種責任、是在繼往開來的青年身上云云、</p>

<p>十二月期金　　紗、在今年七月二日上市、第一盤開拍價爲一百八十四元八角、微跌至三元七角、此時正値申新廠發生謠風、市塲議論紛紜、謂該廠有全部停工整理說、一般投機者皆有妄想、因該廠生產力頗大、如果一且實行停頓、影響市面非淺、賈者如蜂湧而來、同時國内氣候奇旱、棉市趨堅、金融界亦大量的收買做多、而華北一路粗紗、需要暢健、市勢步步趨漲、一度有熱烈景象、最高曾見一百九十一元左右、詎料美國實行收買白銀政策、銀價大長、金價趨短、致吾國物價頗現不安之狀、日滙增至一百二十七元外、引起日商猛力拋賣、市盤下降愈遠、最低曾見一百七十元零五角、嗣至十月、圖府鑒於白銀流出日多、對於白銀增收出口稅復加平衡稅、以作保持上海金融穩定計、使衰弱不振之紗市、突然暴漲、最高又至一百八十八元八角、延至本月中、在一百八十二三元之間盤旋多時、後以有大户收貨、最後一盤狂跳爲一百八十七元、結果交割價爲一百俆十四元、比十一月期漲三元、殘餘五千七百五十包、實行交割計二十支赛寓紗一·六五零包、人鐘三五零包、寳彝一五零包、牧羊一五零包、共計二千三百包、其餘皆爲自行交割、收貨者吳某爲最多、通成公司次之、交貨廠商及套利者、茲將收交兩方經紀人牌號及包額列下、（單位包）</p>

<p>花</p>
<p>十二月期標花在今年七月二日上塲、開盤第一盤價爲三十五元三角、微跌至四元左右、後以國内氣候乾涸、旱災巳成、新棉發育大受打擊、美國棉田减少、人心一致望漲、最高至三十七元、八月八日政府估計發表雖漲、但某紗廠之王某及通成公司、猛力拋出二十萬擔左右、　面受其壓迫、市價由三十七元而徐徐下降、嗣至十月中、國棉全省估計報告產額豐收、因上年農產物低賤、改種棉田者大增、買方失望、同時紗市不起、廠方减工者尤衆、因之棉市最低曾至三十三元外、迨至十月中、國府防止白銀流出計、白銀出口增稅、復加平衡稅、金價大漲、凡百物價一齊奔騰、棉價由三十四元直漲至三十八元、延至本月份在三十六元外、盤旋久時、結果最後一盤價爲三十六元一角、比十一月份價低四角半、殘餘一萬八千二百擔、實行交割僅五千八百擔、其餘皆爲自行交割、貨品計姚花山東粗絨漢口組絨等、交割價爲三十六元半、茲將收交兩方經紀人牌號及包額列下、（單位擔）▲賣方交貨</p>

<p>▲湖南鉛　　目下到貨不湧、且市存單薄、故行情又好、惟花旗鉛萎靡、所以湖南鉛市面不得不隨之而趨和緩、現市每擔估十四元八角、查交易虹口帮尙有拆買、而寗波帮亦微有點級、是以少數交易尙屬良好、而茶商對於明春銷用之貨、業有數家談判、聞其成交巳有四百餘擔、其價每擔爲十四元六角半、比之往年情形、則巳覺遜色不少矣、</p>

<h3 id="c283">年假中應該做些什麽事？ <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，轉瞬就是新年，你們的學校裏不是要放假了嗎？也許你們都在準備着美麗的衣服，呼鮮甜的糖菓，和尋覓各種的娱樂來消遺這大好的良辰？但是，我以這樣是不對的！</p>
<p>那末應該做些什麽呢？你們須知寳貴的光陰，是稍縱即逝的，而且它去了，任你有萬兩黄金，也買不回一寸一分！所以在這年假中，你們依舊應該研究學問，雖然在假期裏，不必到學校去，也該温習一年來師長所敎導的各項功課，和作文，寫字，倘然有疑問的地方，也可以舉出來，去問你們的交兄，在每日早晚，另謀適當的運動，庶幾於學業旣不荒廢，於身體更獲健康。</p>
<p>從前古人說：「學問事業，如逆水行舟，不進則退，」還望小弟弟小妺妺們，奉爲圭臬，總要求智識不斷的增進，切莫使學業向後退步才好！</p>
<h3 id="c284">蔡松坡先生是怎樣的一個人 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 定一</p>
<p>一到十二月二十五日，我就記起蔡松坡先生這位先烈了。</p>
<p>民國四年，袁世凱嗾使楊度等設立籌安會，通電各省，主張帝制。一百又僞造民意，上書勸進。公然設立大典籌備處，改第二年爲洪憲元年。是年十二月二十五日，蔡松坡先生聯合各要人，自雲南發一通電給袁世凱，限他在二十四小時内，取消帝制，卽刻退位，後來便定是日爲雲南起義紀念日。</p>
<p>民國五年一月，袁氏雖仍宣佈帝制，改元洪憲，但見各省先後獨立，一致討袁，遂卽取消帝制，至五月，卽以憂悶失望而死。先生亦因在反抗袁氏期内，積勞過度，事平後，赴日本就醫，延至十一月二十八日，因醫治無效，先生竟棄了再造的中華民國而長逝了。</p>
<p>最後，讓我總括的說一說，蔡先生究竟是一個怎樣的人。</p>
<p>他是一個模範的學生，何以呢？蔡松坡先生幼年喪父，家境很貧，但他能奮勉自勵，勤苦讀書，安慰母親。一生都在半工半讀的境地中，在日本時尤經過種種奮門，終於學成回國。這樣看來，他不是一個模範的學生嗎？</p>
<p>他是一個模範的軍人，何以呢？蔡松坡先生在雲南都督任内，不擾民，不于政，爲人忠實，處事嚴明。不受屈辱，反抗帝制，願一生生命相殉，事後却不居功。這樣看來，他不是一個模範的軍人嗎？</p>
<p>他是一個模範的公民，何以呢？蔡松坡先生護國愛民，奮不顧身，一生只知正義，不畏强暴。這樣看來，他不是一個模範的公民嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c285">空氣 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>空氣眞是一種奇怪的東西，看是看不見，摸不到，那麽我們怎樣會知道空中是有空氣呢？</p>
<p>拿一隻短的玻璃杯，倒置在水盆裏、無論把杯子壓下到如何深度，水不僵昇到杯子的底部。倘使把杯子傾斜，就有氣泡從杯子裏放出，水面也逐漸上昇，從這個試騐，可以證明空氣和别的物質一樣，也占有空間的地位，空氣在地球面上浮蕩，和水在河海裏流行，是一樣的情形，不過空氣比水淺薄，所以空氣的存在，没有水那樣的顯明罷了。</p>
<p>空氣不是一種單純的物質，含有氣，氮，炭酸氣，水蒸氣，和五種稀有氣體：氬，氦，氖，氪。氙這九種的氣體，都有它們的性質和用途。</p>
<p>氧的性質是比空氣重，很容易和各種金屬直接化合，像鐵銹。並且能够助燃燒。用途是供給人呼吸，鑛工和探險家，在海底或鑛裏，裏面没有氧，必須帶入氧才可以不死。</p>
<p>氮的性質是比空氣輕，不會和各種物質化合，必須在高温度和一定的温度，才能和别的物質化合。用途是充電泡，因爲電泡裏不免有氧的存在，於是把氮放入，把氧排出來。製造肥料。</p>
<p>炭酸氣是比空氣重。水蒸氣遇冷，就凝結成水。</p>
<p>五種稀有氣體：氬：不會和别種物質化合。有的電燈泡裏面是氬，就呌氬夫泡。氦：飛艇裏的氣囊，就是這種氣體。氖：用在夜間的廣告牌，五顏六色，很是引人注目，就是這種氣體，俗稱霓虹燈。氪和氙：到現在還没有人發明他們的用途，小朋友們，你們現在用功讀書，到將來去發明氪和氙的用途吧！</p>
<h3 id="c286">自製美麗的賀年片 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 乾恒</p>
<p>小朋友們！又是你們反期望的新年快到了，當然在這新年裏，大家免不了有一番忙碌｜贈賀年片，但是買賀年片來贈，未免太不經濟，你們在校内不是都巳學過「工藝」和「美術」的嗎？</p>
<p>這裏我們就利用它，做一種價廉物美的賀年片吧！</p>
<p>材料　　百磅鉛盡紙，水彩顏料，通草紙（中國藥店均有賣）</p>
<p>做法　　先把自己所喜歡或心愛的圖樣，印在通草紙上，再照圖樣着色，因爲顏色着在通草上，便呈凸起，更顯出活潑和美麗來，然後把它剪下，貼在鉛盡紙的適當地位，再在鉛畫紙上，着櫬些色，就是了。</p>
<p>注意　　一，鉛畫紙形狀不定，長方形，圓形，星形，多角形等都可。但是也不要十分太大，因爲太大了，就覺得粗陋了。二，貼的地位也要適當而美觀，得留出相當的空白來，寫名字和詞句，但是這些都得要憑你們個人的聰明來佈置了。</p>
<h3 id="c287">你有這張照相可像我？ <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>

<p>— 沈丁合</p>
<p>羅珍起來，先向祖父祖母拜年，再向爸爸來拜年。爸爸把羅珍摟抱在膝上。</p>
<p>「爸爸，我要你新年的禮物。」</p>
<p>爸爸點頭說「有」，就放下了羅珍走到寫字檯旁，從抽屜裏拿出一個紅紙對來。</p>
<p>「珍，這是我今年给你的新年禮物。」</p>
<p>羅珍接了紅紙封，急忙拆開來看，伊想這裏頭一定是兩個銀元，但是拆開來一看的原來一張雪白的紙上，畫着一幅被蠶食的中華民國地圖，還寫着幾句詩：</p>
<p>「新年了，新年了，</p>
<p>換新衣，戴新帽，</p>
<p>誰曾把國恥記牢。</p>
<p>從今年起，願你醒了！</p>
<p>從前怯弱，，懶愭抛掉，</p>
<p>今天起，奮鬥，努力向前跑」</p>
<p>羅珍看了，不由覺司起來，熱涙滾滾滴下，抱着爸爸說：「我醒了，我醒了，從今我奮鬥努力了！」</p>
<h3 id="c289">新式賀年片的製法 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 漢生</p>
<p>新年快來了！眞快樂哪！</p>
<p>過新年的時候，我們總要預備了賀年片，寄給朋友們。我想　一定會到書局裏去買些很美麗的賀年片來，總不大高興自己做了幾張而送給您的好朋友的。其實自己親乎做的東西，只有比買的好，而朋友們在接着您寄去的自製的賀年片，他們一定也會做了些寄與您，這樣：大家不是可出此練習乎工玩嗎？</p>
<p>這兒我把幾張新式賀年片的製法，寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）這是一張飛機賀年片，用硬紙片照圖剪成甲，乙，丙三張（大小依照比例自定）；再在子處穿一小孔，　絲綫一根以作縳賀年詞片之用；在有黑綫處，並用剪刀剪開，寄給别人時，可以不要套好的，讓他收到之後自己去套合；硬紙片最好是彩色的，否則在無色紙片上貼以有色紙，顏色則單純爲佳。這張賀年片的意義是「航空救國」，並說祝他（或伊）的進步是和飛機一般的迅速。</p>
<p>（二）這是鐘式員年片，意思是說光陰可貴，不要浪費寸陰；製法照甲圖剪成一座閙鐘形，若是要指針會動，那就加釘兩枚針；反背面加上一張硬紙片在子處用膠水粘住，使鐘可站立。</p>
<p>（三）這是火車頭的賀年片，也是表示祝賀朋友進步之意；照甲圖剪成兩張，然後依圖中說明而塗上膠水，使兩紙合一；窗子糊以透明之紙；卯處不塗膠水，另外製一賀年詞片置於其中，可以抽出來看的；顏色則以說明上所說者較美觀。</p>
<p>（四）這是梅花賀年片，梅花是我們的國花，又是在冬季開放的花；照甲圖剪成一梅花形，並在有子字處穿小孔；此外再照乙圖各物剪取五件，施以彩色，然後用絲綫擊於子處之孔，每孔一件。</p>
<p>以上四種新式賀年片之製法，祇是我所告訴諸位的，各位小朋友若是能看了我的製法而自己再發明許多更好的，那是我最最希望的了。</p>

<p>記得那年我到天津去望姊姊的時候，蒂兒還在襁褓的當中，她還不會說話；我每次把她抱到懷裏，她那兩個鳥黑的眼珠，總是向我臉上溜着。我爲了要留下她那活潑的姿態，曾經給好拍了幾張照片：不久我就和好們離别了。</p>
<p>今年姊姊來到上海，我看見蒂兒幾乎不認識了！因爲她現在巳經能走，能跑，能說話了。她還能剪紙，剪成各種的花樣，有貓，有魚，有人，有器具，有房屋，都是很像的，使我　嘆這個五歲的孩兒，就有了很好的藝術。</p>
<p>我把我從前給她拍的照片拿給她看，並且說：「這就是你。」她却搖搖小手說：「不是！不是！你看我現在有這樣大。」</p>
<p>我致好唱歌，跳舞，好都用心的聽着，看着；不久她就會拿着兩個手帕當翅膀，在學那「蝴蝶飛」了。</p>
<p>姊姊在滬上住了一個月，便帶着蒂兒回到故鄕去，從此我就見不到她那蘋菓般的臉色，和使人歡喜的姿熊了；最近我接到姊姊的來信說：「蒂兒常呌你做「跳舞的舅舅，」她昐望你回到家裏來呢。」</p>

<p>小朋友，我們又有一星期没見面了。今天，我來講幾件關於鳥的有趣的事給你們聽。我想小朋友一定很喜歡罷！</p>
<p>（一）合裁縫的鳥</p>
<p>有種小鳥，和麻雀一樣大小。但是你不要小觀它身體短小，它那造窠的手段，却非常高明呢。它把野蠶結的　抽出絲來。用它的喙當針，把幾張大葉子將絲縫在一起。就此，它的窠便造成了</p>
<p>（二）鱷魚的牙籖</p>
<p>兇惡的鱷魚，有一個好朋友，他就是屑索鳥。鱷魚的仇敵來了，它發出奇怪的聲音。招它的朋友，得從容逃去。鱷魚吃飽了東西，齒裏總是夾着殘剩的食物。覺得非常不舒服，牠就張開了大嘴，等待屑索鳥把食物剔出去。屑索鳥就將食物充饑。小朋友，這不是很像鱷魚的牙籖嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c294">關於「地球上著名的洲洋」的辯正 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>十二月二日本刊有署名苦的，撰述了一簡「地球上著名的洲洋」的文字。苦君說以前敎科書上分亞細亞洲，歐羅巴洲，阿美利加洲，阿非利中洲，海洋洲爲五洲；分太平洋，大西洋，印度洋，北氷洋，南氷洋爲五大洋是錯誤的，他說應該分做六大洲，四大洋。六大洲是：亞細亞洲歐羅巴洲，北阿美利加洲，南阿美利加洲，阿非利加州，海洋洲，四大洋是：太平洋，大西洋，印度洋，北氷洋。其實他所說的還是錯誤的。</p>
<p>正確的界說，應該是七大洲，四大洋。</p>
<p>七大洲是：亞細亞洲，歐羅巴洲，北阿美利加洲，南阿美利加洲，阿非利加洲，大洋洲（即海洋州），和南極洲。</p>
<p>四大洋是；太平洋，大西洋，印度洋，北極洋。</p>
<p>關於六大洲四大洋的確定，也有相當的壓史，在這裏也有述說的必要，現在且看下面的說明吧！</p>
<p>最早的分界，的確是五大洲五大洋。但自從一九一一年那威人亞蒙生等探險南極的結果，確知南極不過是一塊堅氷封鎖的陸地，並非大洋，從此便定名爲南極洲。民國二十二年敎育部也曾通令解釋，確定爲七大洲和四大洋。</p>
<p>今年十一月美國海軍少將裴特所率領这南極探險隊用無綫電報告（見十一月二十日，二十五日申報）說南極非但不是海洋，也不是一簇羣島（有人如此主張）、却是一塊廣袤二十平方英里的大陸。所以多了一個南極洲，是確定的了。</p>

<p>我們來造電</p>
<p>科學先生今天帶了一隻小花貓，和一根雪茄烟那末長的火漆棒（就是封信口的火漆）上台。今天好冷啊，台的左側早巳放着一座燒得很紅的電爐，使台上充满了暖氣。</p>
<p>科學先生說：「今天我們要來造電，你們一定要覺得奇怪，電只有夏天的空中才有，我們怎麽能造電呢？但是你們要知道，一切的物質裏面都含着電。我們先拿這火漆棒來試騐；」</p>
<p>科學先生從褲袋裏拿出了一塊法蘭絨，在火漆棒上很急速地用力的摩擦，擦了一會之後，立刻叫一個小朋友跑到台上來，把火漆捧的擦熱了的一端，送到那位小朋友的頭髮上，有幾根頭髮就被吸引了上來，黏在火漆捧上面，一會兒，又一根一根落下來了。</p>
<p>「火漆捧也含着有電，經我用力摩擦之後，就會發熱，發熱就是生電的現象。這種出摩擦而發生的電，分量是很少的，只能吸引像頭髮紙屑那樣極輕的東西。</p>
<p>「我們再拿這貓來試騐，」科學先生說着，把貓領到電爐旁邊，烘了一會，使它身上暖烘烘的。再牽到台的中央，用乎在貓毛上很急速的摩擦，貓毛就豎立起來，並且發出很輕的「軋軋」的聲音。同時，科學先生叫人把電燈熄了，台上台下立刻暗沉沉的，便看見貓毛上發射着　爛的火花。</p>
<p>「這可以證明貓身上也有電的。你們要玩這兩套電的戯法的時候，如果没有漆棒，那末自來水筆或者假象牙梳子可以。没有法蘭絨，那末毛織物也可以。不過玩的時候，所用的東西越乾燥越好，空氣也要乾燥，在現在這冬天裏玩起來容易成功，摩擦的時候，要用力，要急速。</p>
<p>「要使貓毛生電，不可以把乎緊按着貓毛，要鬆鬆的急速的摩擦着，這樣才能够生電。要看到貓毛上發出的火花，那末必須在黑暗的房裏玩才行。」</p>
<p>試騐的工具！貓一隻。火漆棒一根。法蘭絨一塊。</p>

<p>— 茲</p>
<p>民國二十三年的歲月，随着恐慌動亂的時輪，悄悄地逝去了。</p>
<p>在此迎新送舊的前夜，誰都不免　前顧後有所思量！</p>
<p>國家大尊不敢問，個人些瑣不屑談。自己是女人，對於女人事，比較關心，且總結一下這年頭關於女人的事：</p>
<p>今年的婦女界，特别榮幸，被任爲推銷國貨的專員，然而不中聽的消息，頻頻傳來，全年舶來品的進口，變本加厲，於是羣情情慨，痛詆婦女不爭氣，但實際洞察世界經濟，俯察國内情勢，知道外力逼迫之大，内部抵抗力之奧　這種現象的發生也是必然的。要將這難能之事，者賭於離散而又被重壓下的婦女，實是寃枉。</p>
<p>三四月間，南昌動員新生活運動，即有禁止婦女奇裝異服的訓令，但通都大邑，正大流钎其時裝表現，酥胸露體，雲裳翩翻；窮鄕壤，又有衣飾都麗的貴婦；來往點綴，大有禁者自禁，提倡者自提倡之勢。</p>
<p>自「德」「意」喊出了「婦女回家」的口號，於是中國也從新提倡賢妻良母的敎育了。然而一方因農村的破產，都市的蕭條，大批婦女，棄家奔逃，却有要歸不得之慨！</p>
<p>復古是這年頭的新花樣，隨着復古的氣熖，貞節觀念，從新被人提倡，獎勵，這是婦女解放聲中之一大打樂！</p>
<p>其次，隨着整個的經濟恐慌，人情突變，婦女自殺時有所聞。這又觸目驚心的事實。</p>
<p>以上種種，是今年有關婦女的一筆流水賑，也可算作婦女乘運的流年！</p>
<p>差强人意的，只是爭法運動的成功，然而這又待事實的能否用了。</p>
<p>來年據說是兒童年，兒童年中，育兒問題總得有所解决吧！誰都知道育兒問題不解决，婦女不會得到眞正解放的，所以在兒童年行將來臨的前夕，我深深的厚望着！</p>
<h3 id="c298">總結婦女國貨年 <a href="#c298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— 靜波</p>
<p>婦女國貨年的民國二十三年，時間箭般的巳經滑過去了！</p>
<p>「九一八」而後，抵制日貨的浪朝，洶湧於全國，一時日本對華貿易低落，日本資本頓時感受威脅。一面，日本用傾銷手段，來對付排日運動；另一面，惟利是圖的奸商，利之所在，甘於爲虎作倀，在抵貨運動正高漲的時候，他們爲避免查禁處罰，將日貨偷換商標，以種種巧妙手段去偷賣與偷運。所以，華北和西南，没有大規模的排貨運動，依然充满着價廉物美的日貨。然而，不幸得很，抵制日貨，不但當時曾引起英貨之加緊侵銷，發現這運動本身不健全的結論；同時，又因種種的壓迫，二十二年以後，這抵貨運動便漸沉寂下來。代之而起的，是在「增加國貨生產」口號之下，提倡使用國貨的「國貨年」，於是產生。</p>
<p>民族工商業者，企業家，宣言「爲使國貨就增加生產之途，减少外貨入超數字，而力謀侵銷之日貨，受婦女界熱烈擁護之影響，或可使奸商受良心督責，放棄其危害國家利益」。換名話說，所謂婦女國貨年，是民族工商業者，企業家，得政府之嘉勉與帮助，企圖用這種口號，促進他們資本的發展剌激。</p>
<p>於是，民國二十三年，定名爲「婦女國貨年」了。</p>
<p>國貨展覽會，從上海，杭州，南京，長沙，西安，遍及國内各城市都舉行過，時裝大會也曾在上海和南京幾處地方表演，五花八門，點綴得民國二十三年婦女的熱閙。但總結婦女國貨年的結果怎樣呢？或許個别的工商業者的腰包稍充裕了？而整個民族工業，是不是「國貨巳就增加生產之途，减少外貨入超數字，抵制日貨之侵銷」了呢？據海關發表，本年一月至十月，我全國對外貿易入超額爲四億三千餘萬元。同時，紗業橡膠業均岌岌可危，最近麵粉廠又告减工（十二月三日中華日報）。報紙日貨傾銷記載，都是驚人的激增消息。</p>
<p>自然，這原因不是「提倡國貨」所能補救，也不是「五分鐘熱度」消沉的結果。實質上，帝國主義經濟勢务所支配的中國，發展民族賢資本幾乎是不可能。歐戰後，漸趨相當安定的各帝國主義，重新集中資本加緊對華以來，中國最主要的工業｜｜紡織業之日益衰落，就是明證。</p>
<p>中國經濟的特點，一面是帝國主義的枷銷，一面是封建勢力的束縳。帝國主養和中國的封建勢力相接納，相扶持，造成夾攻的兩種龐大勢力，使中國的民族產業，㪣不過帝國主義的競爭，也受不起封建殘餘的蹂𨈆。中國的民族工業，不但不能擴大再生產，竟連再生產也不能回復，結果是工業生產就破落了，農業也衰微了。再加上旱荒，水災，以及地方軍人或多或少的政治割據，名目繁多的重疊捐挩，幣制紊亂和國内匯兌行市的巨大差異，度量衡制度的不統一，以及有名無實的關稅制度等等，都是使中國產業，不只不能發逹，反而萎縮，以至破產了。</p>
<p>首先，從生產上考查：重工業是近代國家的基礎，中國的煤鐵，十分之九是英日資本的企業。中國的輕工業吧，號稱產業之王的紡織業所受的遭遇，不外是倒閉，停工，减工，存貨。第一是，中國資本和技術，實在幼稚得可憐萬分。在華佔最多數的外國紗廠是日本，日廠資本的雄厚，和技術的改良，巳足打擊中國紗廠沉到没落的浪裏，從經營方法來說，日廠不但晝夜作工，錠數開車，保持均衡，即在同等時間，用同等錠子，日廠的出品，比華廠也一定多；而中國紗廠，固定資本雖多，流動資本不足，原棉國積，生產限制，加以技術的落後，不倒閉停工，便只有减工了。尤其，外資充斥，賽際的支配權完全操在外國人手裏。中國生產部分，混雜不少外資，以及紗廠之利用外棉，麫粉原料，多係洋麥等等，陷中國的生產在半殖民地的從屬性裏，發展不可能。此外，關稅的不自主，外貨潮水似的湧入。同時在華外廠，不但生產品不受入口稅限制，且外人在内地採辦土貨，以有享用三聯單利益，沿途槪免釐稅，華商則否；而且華商購用外棉，多假手外人之又一重剥削；當然外貨的生產成本比中國低。因此，在這種種有利條件底下，外貨廉價傾銷，而中國民族工業生產，永陷在日暮窮途上。</p>
<p>其次，從市塲方面考查：中國没有統一市塲。在對建經濟基礎上，加上各帝國主義的特殊利益，遂造成中國市塲的割據局面。在廣東，四月間西南當局通過了三年實業建設計劃，實行糖，水泥等產品的專買，並頒布了微收省外輸入貨物保護稅則十三條，其微收律竟逹百分之五十。湖南領袖，用維持省立第一紗廠的名義，採取封鎖市塲的辦法，設置棉花管理處，限制滬漢各地紗廠生產的棉紗輸入省境。山西，最近也有不准外省火柴輸入的實施。這事實的結論，是地方主義的封違勢力，依膸各帝國主義的經濟利益，使國内市塲趨於分割；以分割市塲來平衡一省的入超，同時也是想消除日益擴大的財政危機；這正是帝國主義的意志。各帝國主義在華資本戰爭的激化，愈加要求特定勢力範圍的劃分，東北的失陷，就是瓜分開端的明證。這樣，國民經濟的全機構，更落後，更衰退，民族工業只有没落下去。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，純粹站在抵制日貨的立塲上來提倡國貨，這作用是積極的；但是站在中國經濟的發展意義上，那末，這種作用，就變得非常消極了。很明顯的，袁落破碎的中國民族工業，僅只在提倡國貨這一點上，僅只用婦女國貨年這點微弱的刺激，想去挽救自己的厄運，是不可能。寳際上是一種虚弱的幻想罷了。</p>
<p>誰是婦女國貨年的支持者，是高等婦女和中等婦女吧。這些人在婦女中是比較有購買力的。但是，她們的熱心，只是醉心於歐化，摩登，裝飾，所以她們的購買力，不是國貨生產力的增加；事實證明：今年十個月脂粉和玩具輸入，逹三百多萬元，這數日，到是突破歷史上所有的紀錄。而下層社會的婦女大衆，失業，飢餓，，破產，正是她們和婦女國貨年的關係和回答。</p>
<p>所以，今年的婦女國貨年，没有甚麽成效，是必然的事。無足爲怪的。</p>
<h3 id="c299">「社會人」自述 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 李峙山</p>
<p>家庭，學校，社會給我的敎訓</p>
<p>我的家庭雖是「世代書香」，祖父和父親雖然是全村以及數十里内的權成紳士，但因爲窮的緣故，在生活上完全是貧民階級，先母是百里内才貎雙全德工具備的舊式女人，而在生活上，窮得需要伊紡織賺幾吊錢買糧食才不致挨餓。在這樣璟境裏的一個小女孩，怎末能逹到現在的境地呢？容我述在下面：</p>
<p>怎樣得到讀書的機會</p>
<p>我怎樣得着讀書的機會呢？（一）我父親是個思想豐富眼光遠大的讀書人，他的哲學是無論什麽事都要佔「鳳氣之先」。（二）我唯一的弟弟死了之後，父母旣没有兒子，就想裁培女兒。（三）我向父母聲明，如允許我到天津去讀書，兒子奉養父母的責任我定能負担起來。於是我父親隨即把僅有的十畝田變賣了供給我到天津師範學堂去讀書。這是民國二年的事情。彼時在北方的風氣還是十分閉塞的，女子出外讀書的，鹽山縣祇我一人。</p>
<p>學校給我的影響</p>
<p>我旣排除種種困難得着讀書的機會，自然是拚命的用功。初到校的時候，事事不懂，人人都　笑我是鄕下丫頭。但在第二學期，我便成了本班的代表人物。學校第一次舉行的辯論會，我雖在最低學級，也被派爲辯論員之一。在辯論終結評判員計算分數的當兒，我便自動的跑到書上去向全體回學演說辯論會之益處，勸同學們踴躍參加。就是這末一來，我却遇着了重大的打繋：校長馬上對衆宣布我不懂規矩，在上臺之先，須向主度請求發言，經主席允許才有上臺說話。可憐！才從鄉下出來的孩子，學校裏又從無集會的訓練，我怎能懂得呢？當衆碰了這個大釘子，給我的打擊實在太重了，從此以以後，直到畢業，我未參加過學校的任何活動。現在思想起來，這於我能力緞練上的影響太大了。然而我得在學校裏得到比較豐富的科學常識，爲我進修的基礎。所以這一階段的生活是值得在這裏特别提及的。</p>
<p>任敎職及參加「五四」運動</p>
<p>在師範讀了五年書，於民國七年暑假畢業，被派在附小任敎職。彼時，小學敎員最高薪水每月三十元，但是我爲實際担負奉養父母的責任還兼任了一處家庭敎師，及其他學校的課程，每月竟有五十多元的收入。私生活也很範儉，除伙食三元，零用三元以外，便全數交給我父親，在鄕間每月有四五十元的收入，眞是了不得，於是大家都願意送女孩子去讀書，風氣爲之一新。直到現在止，我還是担負着兒子養家的責任。</p>
<p>彼時我的心境極愉快，女兒也可以當得兒子，爲女子爭了一口氣，身心雖然勞苦，精神却是快慰的。爲着向父母盡兒子的責任，及怕作兒媳婦｜｜北方的兒媳婦生活最苦，又親眼看見先母受種種惡劣待遇以至於死，故誓不結婚。擬獨身一生，爲敎育界服務，認係爲國，爲家，爲自身都是最合宜的計劃。</p>
<p>民圖八年五月，「五四」這動發生了。爲受翩心及和男子爭勝的心情所剌激，乃與母校同學組織天津婦女愛國同志會，這是我參加社會運動的開始。在負責愛國同志會的工作過程中，仍和從鄕間初到學校的情形一棪，碰了若干釘子，才瞭解了怎樣應付社會，以及怎樣領導羣衆。啊！「五四」運動給我的敎訓太大了：使我解放了思想，放大了眼光，不满足現社會，要創造新人生，僅守住聯業尙不是完美的生活，需要事業的創造。獨身生活是違背自然，結婚一樣可以奉養父母，且可不必在翁姑乎下作兒媳婦。於是我的人生觀改變了：對於職業視爲物質生活的需求，對於事業認爲精神生活的寄托，對於婚姻，則以爲獨身的精神不可無，獨身的事實不必有。　業的範圜自然不限於小學敎員，事業的範圜則决定終身從事於婦女運動及愛國運動。</p>
<p>職業及事業中的我</p>
<p>從事職業生活，於今巳十有七年。其間曾作過小學敎員，中學訓育；日刊，旬刊，月刊等編輯，以及黨官機關職員等。就中以黨官生活最苦，當民國十六年任上海市黨部執委時、經歷着許多黨的派别糾紛以及由朋友轉爲敵黨的一些卑鄙　齼的事情，令人不堪回憶，因此我感覺到我是最不適於政治生活的。就中以編輯的職務最使我感到興味，因爲我所編的都是婦女刊物，也有事業的成分在裏面。</p>
<p>在事業方面，自「五四」時從事愛國運動開始　曾與富於革命意識的女同志，出版天津婦女日報，組織女星社，出版女星旬刊，創辦女星婦女補習學校等。自國民黨北伐成功，在南京上海等地，屢作喚起婦女　緖組織，一方面促進民族革命这成功，一方面　現男女權利之平等的企圖，至今百無一成，實是摲愧呀！我所參加的事業中，至今還存在者，叭有婦女共鳴月刊一種，然而，這於實際的事業上又有什麽帮會呢？因爲感覺精神生活的貧乏，今年又和京市同志們，組織婦女文化促進會，謀與志同道合的姊妹們，作切實的圜結，先從解决婦女自身的痛苦入手，然後再擴大使成爲婦女運動，國民革命的有力隊伍。</p>
<p>走入社會後的感想</p>
<p>走入社會後十七年的我，覺得社僵是冷酷的，自私的，實不容娜拉式的女子　足。一個女子跑到社會上，面面受着不平等的禮敎及對建勢力的束縳。社會人士，最會中傷女人，而且是慣以性關係來中傷。在這朝裏無人莫作官的男子社會裏，女子偶因長官的提拔而升官，性中傷的話就出來了。看吧現在官位較高的女子，那個不曾受過中傷？這足表示社會對於女子誠意的欠缺。自辛亥革命到現在，女子得着男子誠意的提携，約有三個時期：即辛亥革命，「五四」運動，國民革命軍北伐的三個革命緊張的時期。革命空氣一　懈，玩弄女子的觀念即隨之而生，甚至於設下種種園套以欺騙女子，及至女子入了圈套之後，則又造出笑馬誹謗的大道理與以刻責。除上述的三時期外，踏入社會的女子，可以說無日不在烏雲重重的黑暗中奮鬥着。我也是這奮鬭羣中的一員小將。</p>
<p>二十三年十二月二十五日於婦女共鳴社</p>
<h3 id="c300">由任命四届立委說到婦女運動 <a href="#c300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— 箴一</p>
<p>本月二十六日中政會任命四届立法委員八十六人，其中六十七人係三届委員連任，原任女立委二人均未蟬聯，而以另二人代之。歷届女子立委人數，不但没有增加，且較第一二届减少一人。</p>
<p>有些人也許認爲這是婦女運動的退步，婦女參政閙了這多年，成績不過如此，其實這種看法是不對的。</p>
<p>如果眞的認爲這是婦女運動的退步，那婦女運動祗是把少數婦女推上政治舞臺的運動，而不是謀求婦女大衆解放的運動。在這禮敎這毒仍然存在的中國，經濟權完全操在男子的手中，一切政治，敎育，立法，皆以男性爲中心，女子非爲玩物，卽作奴隸，雖然資本主義侵入。吸收了不少女子參加生產，給予了一些女子獲行職業的機會。然而婦女的束縳，並未减輕，甚至婦女回到家庭去的空氣，日益濃厚。在這種狀况下，要專靠幾個由政府任命的立法女委，由上而下的來解放婦女大衆，是不可能。莫說祇有二三女委提案萬難通過，卽令有較多的婦女參加，假使是代表羣衆說話的，那，男子爲擁護自己的利益，也可以用種種方法，將她們抑壓或排擠。所以眞正的婦女運動，應當以多數覺悟的婦女爲基礎，聯合農村婦女及家庭婦女，由下而上的謀婦女澈底的解放。</p>
<p>婦女參政，並不是絶對没有用處的，如果婦女有堅固的團體，有雄厚的力量，未嘗不可藉着政治的勢力，而獲行部份的福利。否則離開羣衆的參政，除了提高個人的身份和地位外，與整個的婦女運動，毫無關係。</p>
<h3 id="c301">聖誕老人與婦女國貨年 <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>我對聖誕老人第一次的認識，是在我十三歲進了一個敎會學校，度第一次聖誕節的時候。記行是在十二月二十五號午後兩點鐘，鈴聲一響，全校的人像一窩蜂似的，都擁進了健身所，只見評判臺上立着一個化裝的洋老頭子，身着大紅袍，满頭满頰全是棉花貼成的白髮白鬚；據老同學說，那就是聖誕老人，送隔誕禮物給我們的。</p>
<p>不久，果然全校的人，上自校長，下至看門的，每人都由這奇怪老頭子手裏，接到一個紅紙包。心急的人們，不等回到坐位上，便將紙包打開來了。有些人得的是，外國的拍紙簿和一鉛筆，六個Ｂ七個Ｂ的，有的則是洋信紙信封，有的是洋橡皮擦和洋鋼筆桿。聖誕節每年都是巍巍然地來到人間，同時聖誕老人每年都有禮物帶給每個人。可是時移事遷，每年的禮物也有了改變。慢慢的，同學們有的得着一盒擦面的外國香粉，有的便是一長盒外國爽身香粉了。</p>
<p>正如不久以前，同學們對於洋鉛筆，洋信紙信封，以及洋橡皮擦鋼筆桿等，有了深切的愛好，而爭相掏腰包來購買一樣，大妖精小妖精們對於外國的擦面粉和爽身粉，更有了性命似的愛好。現在不但從前盛極一時的冰片爽身粉，無人過問，就是以前視爲不可一日缺的擦面鵝蛋粉，如有人仍在採用，大家好像有了盟約似的，誰都要將那人看爲土老兒，看爲鄕裏大姐。正在這個當兒，聖誕老人又換了新花樣，它這一次帶來的，却是一些五光十色，燦爛奮目的玻璃珠的項鍊了。而且接着的許多年頭，禮物也就年年花樣翻新，由洋絨繩，洋絲綫，和釘衣的洋花邊，一變而爲洋皮夾和洋假手鐲，再變而爲嵌珠的髮押，别針，以及洋假賓石的戒指了。於是天下又起了一個大變化：戴赤金項鍊，戒指，以及赤金别針和手鐲的，是土老兒，是鄕裏大姐：登時髦之基的，又是洋手飾了。</p>
<p>跟着時光的消逝，據我届指算來，我的母校的同學，以及全國各洋學校的女生，如此受着聖誔老人的洋禮物之賜，至今巳是將近二十餘年了。其成績，據各報所登載，在今年這個提倡國貨最力的年頭，我國婦女化妝用品及衣飾洋手飾等，各國進口共逹二百萬元之多。可是近來有許多愛國志士，憂着金錢的外溢，巳在那兒做着送婦女國貨年的文章，要婦女們不要以婦女國貨年的結束，視爲責任巳經完了，應該急起直追，挽回吾國的經濟利權。不但如此，有些聰明之士，竟將這嫋嫋的一綫希望，眼巴巴地寄之於明年的學生國貨年身上。我看這種希望，終久只是希望而巳。君不見，各洋貨開路先鋒的傀儡｜｜聖誕老人｜｜它的提綫人，是在那裏日漸繁殖，一代多似一代，他們巳由父傳子，子傳孫，現在巳到重孫曾孫的時代了。它那根深蒂固的威勢，决不是幾句「愛國」「愛國」和來幾個」「什麽年」「什麽年」所能殺得到的。大家睜開眼睛，再看清楚些罷！</p>

<p>被人稱爲「小上海」的天津的確有點海味，工商業在華北算是中心，在交通上不用說更是中樞，於是有着大眼晴一樣的窗洞的洋樓，摩天而立，柏油馬路上行車的速度都是最高的，舞廳裏徹夜歌舞不絶：這些都是帶着十足的都市味的。</p>
<p>站在水平綫上的天津婦女倿是浸在爭厅鬥艶的角逐中｜｜當然，指的是一部分。有所謂交際花與名媛們，熱中于參加什麽歌舞團會，有時榮幸地參與着什麽命名或奠基典禮，在萬衆歡呼聲中剪一剪帶擲一擲香檳杯，第二天的畫報上便有了題材。有時候，百貨公司或國貨商店的老板們聰明起來，特請一些名門小姐或夫人來作衣架，顯示一些新的綢緞或毛衣，衣服的式樣是使一般小百姓們獃獃地莫明其妙。</p>
<p>幸福的是：這裏還没有什麽禁舞或禁止男女携手同行的訓令，人們是有着相當的自由的。有多少北平的舞迷們都念着天津的舞廳，那裏有着公開的舞女，十層以上的洋樓，一切的設備都是追隨着上海的，樂聲中，人們忘記了人世的苦臉，那張有着紅唇或油亮的頭髮的臉上總是掛着笑的。</p>
<p>大學女生們也有不少是眞在苦幹的，南開大學的女生總被人看重一點，許是爲了校風及課程，其實又比起河北女師的女生們來，她們巳帶了不少的貴族味了。女學生們迷着的玩藝是：賽球，溜冰，游泳。愛運動幾乎成了華北女學生一致的嗜好，不比江南的姑娘們好靜的多。說到娱樂，不能忘却的是天津的賭，除了牌及撲克外還有大型的輪盤賭及迴力球塲······這兒出現着一些闊太太或年輕的姨太太們。這一切繁華的處所大半全是在租界中的，天津的租界是多的。</p>
<p>當着敎員及小職員的婦女也不少，她們過着平板安穩的生活，在温飽之外再逛逛公　看看電影便算是額外的點綴了。</p>
<p>天津的妓院明明暗暗地存在着，妓女兼舞女的才容易門庭如市。暗娼裏，深藏着被生活壓下過來的啼泣，在路角街頭或遊戲塲中拉扯着男子的衣襟，描黑了的眼角裏飛着笑。</p>
<p>中國地裏住着苦力的婦女或是勞工們，洋樓起建時看得見她們打椿或是挑泥瓦，把孩子放在一邊。天津的工廠烟囱是下不，女工們有的要跑好幾里地從信的地方跑到租界中去。像城隍廟之類性質的「三不管」中終年有着賣糖賣玩具的女人，唱蹦蹦戲的女人，愛唱水的天津女人挺着肚子蹓躂着。</p>

<p>時間像在夢裏過去了似的，轉瞬間，一九三四年又將殘了，閃電一般的光陰呵！</p>
<p>人眞像海裏的波浪似的，連自己都不知道自己的行止，自己的未來！我也像一朶浪花似的飄到這寒冷的島國來了！誰料到我會在東京度過一九三四年呢？</p>
<p>在這兒，我認識了很多努力研究中國文學的有友，也認識了好幾位努力於文化工作以及婦女解放運動的女同志。他們都是時代的先進者，努力於新社會創造的戰士，我很高興，雖然從寂寞的小房間裏看去，大地是這麽寒冷，陰森，白茫茫地一片雪景，但我的精神是像春天一般興奮着的！</p>
<p>無論是在白天或晚上，我總不敢体息，我覺得人生實在太短促了，該求的知識，要做的事務很多，即使是一分鐘的時間，也不應該讓牠輕輕地讓它過去，至於浪費時間，更是絶對不可。</p>
<p>我又常常想到，婦女的工作，比男子還要多，婦女所負的使命比男子的還要重大，因爲我們除了努力於文化事業外，還要謀被壓迫婦女的解放運動，家誔間一切的瑣事更不要說，也是婦女担任的，因此，所有的女作家都應該至少負起兩重使命來，一方面努力於文化工作，一方面努力於被壓迫婦女的解放運動。</p>
<p>除了一二國以外，全世界的婦女都處在被壓迫的地位，她們與男子同樣是人，但因社會的經濟制度不平等，所以她們過的是非人的生活，地獄一般的黑暗生活，努力於文化工作的女同志們，婦女的痛苦，只有婦女自身才深刻地了解，深刻地和她們表同情。其實我們不應該說同情她們，因爲自己和她們一樣地處在被壓迫的地位，自己的生活也和她們一樣地不自由，一樣地悲慘，痛苦，可憐。我們要挺起精神來做整個的被壓迫婦女解放運動！在我們的創作裏更要多多地描寫勞働階級婦女大衆的生活，她們的痛苦和要求。</p>
<p>一九三四年快完了！大家靜靜地想一想吧，在這一年裏我們貢獻了些什麽給藝術，貢獻了些什麽給社會？我想也許誰都有感想吧？誰都都想到時間過的太快，一年又完了，自己預定的工作没有完成，社會仍舊是黑暗的社會，我們的生活仍舊是不自由的生活，無數萬萬被壓迫的人類在飢寒交迫下，在砲火連天中犠牲了！寫到這裏，我停住了筆，謹向犠牲在爭鬥下的中國羣衆一致一九三四年的祭禮！</p>
<p>新年快到了！我不像孩子時代一般的感到快活，但我也並不悲哀，過去了的冰讓牠過去吧，我們要把握着現在，更要緊緊地抓住未來！寒冷陰森的冬天，將隨着殘年而去了，暖融融的春天將給與我們以前進的力，努力創造新文化，新女性的生命吧，親愛的同志們！</p>

<p>— 朱心華</p>
<p>今年號「雜誌年」·而且在六百餘種民間發行的刊物中，專講「純文藝」的似乎也不少，但是無論呌誰來說，都會要道也一九三四年的中國文壇是並不熱鬧的。講文藝理論吧，在本年之内，並没有較大的眞正值得一讀的關於文藝原理，文藝批評，和文學史的書籍出現，也没有較有系統的關於一般文藝理論的論戰，有的只是幾個文藝刊物在其每期的「社談」裏刊載的小品文字，只是在幾個報屁股上所掀起的如什麽「京派海派」等問題的論爭；自然，在這中間也有比較重要的問題，如關於語文學，關於文學的遺產······等問題的被提出，不消說都是有着重大的意義，但就在這些問題的爭論中，在理論的表現上也都是比較貧弱的。至於創作，那更是說不上了。事實告訴我們，在本年内，除了在各文藝刊物上刊載的若干短篇作品之外，較好的長篇單行本的作品幾乎不能找到。新進作家自不必說，就是有幾位老作家，如茅盾，魯迅，郁逹夫····等，在本年内也没有什麽東西產生出來·也許是因爲要塡補創作界的空虚吧，在本年内印成單行本的作品，最多的乃是「某某自選集」或「短篇小說選」···等等之類。</p>
<p>然而，一九三四年的中國文壇也並不是一片空地，什麽都没有的。雖然無論在理論方面或創作方面的表現都很貧弱，但曅竟總還有一些表現；而且，在理論方面，因爲有幾個重要問題的提出討論，卽令這在目前不能有什麽收穫，但在我國文學的發展上却是有很大的推進力量的。所以，我們爲了要明白過去，展望將來，依然有檢討一下過去一年來中國文壇的必要。</p>
<p>先談在本年中國文壇上引起爭論的幾個問題吧·</p>
<p>在今年中國文壇上首先出風頭的，誰都知道是小品文。隨着小品文的大出風頭，便引起了小品文與大文章的戰爭。幽默大師林語堂先生首先嘛辦「人間世」，專鬥提倡小品文，倡言小品文大可以「談宇宙」，小可以「說蒼蠅」，眞是無所不行。但在加一方面的人却說：「小品文只適宜於表現蒼蠅，不適宜於表現宇宙：要說明宇宙，因而解决宇宙問題，便非長篇大論的大文章不可，短小的小品文是不能勝任的。無論怎樣，善於作小品文的天才，總不能在一篇短短的小品文中說明宇宙的起源及其進化····這樣的大問題。自然，小品文也是可以說明宇宙問題之某一部份的，也是可以抓信某部份的小點來闡明整個宇宙的，但也只是如斯而巳，依然不能算是能够說明因而解决宇宙與人生的大問題。如果一個小品文作家，要標出一個宇宙的或社會的大問題來，企圖在短短的文字中說明因而解决牠，那結果一定是要失敗的。」（見五月十一日「大美晚報」）</p>
<p>提倡小品文的，又因小品文貴於短小精幹，所以又發出「文貴簡」的議論。但對此反對者也有反駁｜｜「···用數十百萬字，寫一個人一天之内的心理變化，也不會有人以爲繁的。而吳承恩原本「西遊記」，其繁處却勝於朱鼎臣楊致和的删改本。如果有人把「紅樓夢」删成兩三萬字的節本，豈不是精華全去，糟粕徒存！所謂近代的短篇小說，也不僅以短爲尚。許多重要的短篇小說，往往是在二三萬字以上的。</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>「原始的歷史，以數字，數十字記人一生，今日的小說却把一日的故事寫成數千萬言。這到底是進化呢，還是退化呢？可不煩言而便能明白的。」（見「文學」二卷六號）</p>
<p>這的確是對於過分提高小品文地位，主張「文貴簡」的小品文大師一個有力的駁斥。</p>
<p>可是，後來就在小品文範圍内也有了分化：一面是以「太白」爲代表的有新的内容的小品文，另一面則是以「人間世」爲代表的所謂「言志」的並企圖復活文言的小品文。前者雖然還没有什麽成績表現出來，　其所傳逹的思想與感情却是比較進步的：後者則以北平幾位古董敎授的雜感，書信和打油詩來炫耀自己，其用處只是五於茶餘洒後的消遺。語堂大師自己說得好｜「半月刊（指其小品文半月刊｜作者）　（）文約四萬，正好得一夕玩閒閱看兩小時。閱後捲被而臥，明日起來，仍舊辦公抄賑，做校長出通告，自覺精神百倍，猶如赴酒樓小酌者，昨晚新筍炒扁豆滋味猶在齒頰間。」（見「人間世」第四期）</p>
<p>緊接着關於小品文問題的爭論的，是關於語言問題的提出。這中間，首先引起人們注意的，是六月十八日「自由談」上陳子展先生的一篇文章：「文言｜白話｜大衆語」。自此以後，如「中華日報」之「動向」，「申報」之「本埠增刊」，「新語林」，「太白」，「社會日報」，「社會月報」····等刊物都捲人了這論戰的漩渦，所有全國的新舊作家幾乎都參加了這個論戰。關於這問題的文字，如果完全彙集起來，我想起碼總有兩大厚册。但因篇幅和别的關係，我不能在此介紹並批判各方面的意見，請讀者諸君自己去考究吧。在這裏我只是將各方的主要意見摘要地寫點出來｜｜</p>
<p>一部份人說文言簡潔可貴，所以企圖復古文言；</p>
<p>另一部份人則主張保守「五四」時代的思想，擁護白話文；</p>
<p>還有一部份人是折衷主義者，他們說文言白話各有好處，主張文白並用合用；</p>
<p>也有一部份人覺得文言白話都巳過了時代，主張建立大衆語：並進而廢除方塊字，採用羅馬字拚音法，以澈底改造中國的語言文字。</p>
<p>在這幾個意見中，誰是對的呢？我不能以「是」「非」二字在此作簡單的論斷，還是希望讀者自己去詳加考究；罷。</p>
<p>此然還有「接受文學的遺產問題」，「翻譯外國作品問題」，「何以中國未能產生出偉大的作品的問題」，這些都是在本年中國文壇上提出的重要問題。但是，也因爲篇幅關係，不能在此一一說明·現在，對於我們景必要的，</p>

<h3 id="c305">一九三四年的世界與中國的總的說明 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 徐雉</p>
<p>時間不信地向前飛奔，去年剛剛過去，今年又告終了。曾記得，當我們剛把一九三四年的日歷放在案頭的時候，就有什麽預言家說：在本年之内，世界上要死一個軍事家各政治家。果然，德國興登堡將軍於本年逝世了，小拿破崙杜爾夫斯在維也納被人剌殺了，南王亞力山大與法外長巴爾都也都在馬賽喫了物槍，好好的比王亞爾培也從崖上跌了下來，死於非命，而蘇聯中央委員基洛夫也在日前遭人暗殺：這是加倍地證明了我們預言家預言的正確！</p>
<p>其實，以世界之大，被稱爲政治家和軍事家的人又是這樣的多，你說在一年之内，特别是在這危機四伏的年頭兒裏，會不會死去一二個政治家或軍事家呢？然而，預言家的預言旣巳行到了證明，也就無須我們再來發什麽議論了！</p>
<p>與預言一九三四年必定有人死一樣，世界上更有不少政治的，軍事的專家發出了如是的驚人預言：第二次世界大戰必然會在一九三六年爆發！而且還津津有味地說：一旦大戰爆發了，某國的軍艦必將下駛至某地，某國的空軍又將襲炸某城；起先某國必定潰敗，隨後又必然要轉敗爲勝···這樣的相命先生似的推算，我們雖還未敢相信是否完全靈騐，但就一年來國際間的許多重要事變看來，大戰的危機却確是一天一天地逼到我們面前來了。請把過去的日曆翻開來看一看啊！維也納的不斷擾動，意大利軍隊的一再動員，德國和蘇聯當局的清黨，西班牙的動亂，中歐和巴爾幹風雲的緊急，南美巴波間的砲聲，英美日海軍預備會的破產，蘇關係的蝁化····這些偉大的事實告訴我們，戰爭之神眞好像一架速度最快的飛機，忽而在中歐旋轉，忽而又在太平洋上飛翔，誰也說不定牠會在什麽時候降落在什麽地方的啊！</p>
<p>聰明的朋友，你一定知道，預言家預言之是否得到了事實的證明，政治家和軍事家的推算之是否靈騐，這都没有多大的研究意義；然而，預言家政治家們不管别的，却偏要預言一年内將會死去怎樣的人物，却偏要推算世界大戰爆發的時期，這不是正表示着一般人的神經過敏嗎？是的，每在一個大的事變的前夜的時候，一般人總是神經過敏的。｜｜這就是一九三四年的世界的總的說明·</p>
<p>中國呢？若依一般熱心國貨運動者的規定，則一九三四年是「婦女國貨年」，若呌文人們來說，則這年又是「雜誌年」。其實都有道理。事實上，在這一年之内，婦女們對於提倡國貨的確是盡了相當力量的，除了開會，遊行，這些形式上的表現之外，單看南京路上國貨商塲的熱鬧情形，也就可以想見在本年内國貨運動的成績了；同時，據說今年出版的雜誌共計有一千餘種之多，這與往年的比較起來，今年當然也可以說是「雜誌年」了。不過，在「婦女國貨年」中，據報載各種化妝品的輸入還是特别的多，入超的數目字似乎還在上昇；同時，在「雜誌年」中，雖是有一千多種的雜誌，但與其他先進國家的比較起來，仍是非常非常的少，而且就在這一千多種雜誌中，眞正可看的也很少，一年來文壇上除了鬧什麽「小品文」「大品文」的問題外，似乎還未看到比較令人满意的作品產生出來；｜｜這一切都充分說明了我們在一九三四年的努力還不够，而需要再來一個「國貨年」，再來一個「雜誌年」的！朋友們，來！集中一切的力量，大家來泛起民族的巨浪，大家來掀起中國海的怒潮！</p>
<p>同時，如果再看這一年來在帝國主義壓迫下的中國社會情形，那也是一樣令人感到恐懼的。抬頭一望，幾乎满眼是大衆的創傷，满耳是大衆的慘呌！那普遍全國的水災旱荒，業巳造成了無數災民的無法生存；在不景氣的狂流襲擊之下，這一年内也不知有好多工廠和作坊關了門，也不知有好多商店宣告清理，更不知增加了好多的失業人羣。此種情形，又是怎樣地在警告我們應該如何繼績奮鬥啊！</p>
<p>朋友，世界形勢旣是那樣的緊急，而中國的一切情形又是如此地告訴我們必須繼續努力奮鬥，於此，你將怎樣清算過去，籌劃將來，這不是一個非常嚴動的問題嗎？</p>
<p>是還當略爲談談一年來的中國文學創作。</p>
<p>遍尋了四馬路的書店，好容易才發現了本年出版的兩本中篇小說（說是長篇小說亦可）的單行本：沈從文的「邊城」：老舍的「小坡的生日」。但我只想在此談談前者；後者泥？待到有機會時再說。</p>
<p>在「邊城」中，作者首先告訴我們：在湘西邊境有一個名呌「茶峒」的小山城，這裏有一條小溪，一個老人，一個女孩子與一隻黄狗在管理這溪上的一隻渡船，每天不住地渡着來往的行人；那老人和女孩子都非常忠厚柔和，都很忠實於他們的職務，對於來往客人也不要錢，有時就是客人要把點錢給那老人，他也絶對不要，甚至會因客人堅决要給錢而使他急得吵起來；就是那隻黄狗也是很懂人情的，一在船抵岸時牠就會跳上岸去爲老人用口拉信繩子。接着作者又努力描畫這「邊城」茶峒的風俗人情是多麽的善良，一般人是如何的純善，忠厚，温和；所有這兒的水手，船主，商人，兵，乃至於娼妓，都是各安其業，並願帮助别人的好人；在這裏，没有欺許，没有紛擾，没有一切殘酪的不平現象，有的只是誠實，和平，與夫存在於「一般人性」中的喜怒哀樂的表情。｜｜這在目前的現實的情况之下，眞可說是「世外的桃源」啊！</p>
<p>但「世外桃源」裏的一切情形，其中一般的生活形式，都是存在於好多年前的中國社會中的，現在的中國可就没有這個世界。現在的中國是農村經濟破產，都市工商業凋敝，我們所見到的都是饑寒交迫，欺詐胡爲，與夫紛擾不安的現象。</p>
<p>處在現實的欺詐，紛擾的環境中的人，有一部份是感到現實的惡劣而神往於過去的。如果你肯走到鄕間，走到前一輩的老人中去，那你定可常常聽到這一類的話：還是過去好，满清時候好，那時的人都老實，那有現在的人這樣狡詐？唉，何時才出眞命天子啊！上述茶峒的一切情形，「邊城」裏的社會思想，便是這種意識的反映。</p>
<p>作者爲了要表現這種思想，便構成了一個戀愛故事，這故事卽是構成「邊城」的骨幹。在這中間，作者描寫了忠厚的老船夫的外甥女翠翠與船總順順的第二個兒子互相愛着，但船總的大兒子也愛翠翠，後來因這大兒子覺得不能與其弟弟競爭，卽出門在河下經營生意，不料於途中給水淹死了；於是船總和他的第二個兒子都不满意老船夫，以爲他們的兒子和哥哥是因爲他多事弄死了的；後來老船夫死了，船總雖要娶翠翠爲媳，但他的第二個兒子却出門未歸，不知何時回來，不知是否回來。於是小說「邊城」就算完結。｜｜就在這中間，作者在盡力描寫故事中的曲折線上，加强了他反表現的社會思想之藝術的效能。但因他所反映的社會思想是企圖逃避現實的社會思想，其所表現的世界不是現實的世界，而是過去的世界，所以又大大地傷害了他的作品的價值；而且，在許多地方，我們還覺得作者描寫力的不够，如老船夫死了，孤零的翠翠除哭泣外，並没有如何動人的表情，事實上，一個受了最大的慘痛的剌激的人，特别是如翠翠那樣的人，是不僅哭泣而巳的，她的動作，她的心理，必然的要起大的變化。但作者對此却只是以抽象的哭泣來表現。</p>
<p>如果作家的自傳也可以逄是文藝作品時，那麽，於此我們便可舉出「巴金自傳」來。</p>
<p>我並不認識巴金，但我却喜歡他，敬佩他。什麽道理呢？因爲，每一，他能始終忠實於他的信仰，不像他的有些同伴們一樣，隨便亂跳。自然，他的信仰是否全對還是需要討論的問題，但在此氣節敗壞的情形之下，他能始終對他所認識的眞理負責，不隨便亂跳，這却是值得敬佩的。在本年出版的他的自傳中，他還這樣堅决地說：「我並不曾有過一個時候秩掉了我的信仰，所以我永遠像一個强硬漢子似的忍受了這一切，我没有發出我一聲痛苦的呼號。雖然我的小說裏有時候竟因此含了深的憂鬰性，但這憂鬰性也並不曾掩蔽了那一線光明。我的對於人類的愛鼓舞着我，使我有力量和一切掙扎。一｜｜這種精神，是使我喜歡巴金的第一原因。第二，巴金能認眞生活和寫作，他不離開現實，他常去旅行，深入到一般人羣中去考察和體騐他們的生活，隨着卽忠實地描寫出來貢獻給社會；自然，在他的世界觀觀點之下所描寫出來的現實是否適合於客觀世界的狀况和要求，尙是問題，但他能勇於接近現實，並盡量地忠實於現實以從事其創作這一點，却仍是徝得我們敬佩的。｜｜這是我喜歡巴金的第二點。</p>
<p>「巴金自傳」雖然很短，但春中也述說了作者的切。看了這個之後，舉凡作者幼年的生活，家庭情形，創作經過，都可以大略知道一點。至於文筆方面，則因作者是有創作經騐的作家，也是很好的。不過，有一點還不能令我們完全满意，卽作者所經過的幾個大的時代（如「辛亥革命」，如一九二五年以後的時代），不曾在這中間鮮明地顯露出來，因此减少了他這自傳的社社意義。</p>
<p>除此之外，本年也版的什麽「集」什麽「選」的創作東西倒似乎不少。據我所見到的有｜｜｜</p>
<p>沈從文：「如　集」生活版</p>
<p>老　舍：「趕　集」</p>
<p>良友版</p>
<p>茅　盾：「話厘子」</p>
<p>良友版</p>
<p>穆時英：「白金的女體塑像」　　現代版　　　　張天翼：「移行」　良友版</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>但我的文章似乎巳經寫得太長了，不能再對這些有所評論，就這樣結束了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c306">一年來的中國戲劇 <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭浪女士</p>
<p>這裏我想作全國性的叙述。但因爲限於個人的見聞和材料不全關係，這裏恐怕難免有遺漏和錯誤的地方。這是先要請讀者諸君原諒並指正的。</p>
<p>一般的說，除了少數地方如南京等地外，全國各地的戲劇空氣大都是很沉寂的。由於客觀環境的决定，戲劇家的呼吸常未能如人們想像的那末自由。更由於主觀能力的欠缺，劇人們努力的成效也常未能如所預期的那末好。今年，不論從劇刊方面看，戲劇論爭論爭方面看，或是演出方面看，都不曾有過輝煌燦爛的表現。現在，我們不妨針對着這各方面作一個扼要的清算。</p>
<p>（一）劇刊的零落｜今年是出名的「雜誌年」，但這「雜誌年」和戲劇是没有緣分的，戲劇雜誌的創刊很少見到。雖然我們在這一九三四年的年底，巳看到了在九十月間就預告了的包時凌鶴吳鐵翼魯思等四位先生編的「現代演劇」月刊，但我們近頃所着到的獻劇專門刊物，也只有這一本而巳。上年三四月間，我們在書店裏翻到過上海一部分劇人創辦的「演劇藝術」，但只是薄薄的一本，出了三期以後也早巳看不見了。在中國的其他都市，也絶少聽見有單行本的戲劇雜誌創刊。北平雖有一本「中國戲曲音樂院研究所」出版的「劇學月刊」，但這並不是一本話劇雜誌，他們所倡導的主要的是舊劇，話劇的文章在裏面是不大容易找到的。</p>
<p>報紙的戲劇副刊，情形雖比較地好，但從全盤上考察，亦未能使人满意。上海方面，民報的「戲劇周刊」（後改爲「戲劇運動」）不知何故，在六月間停刊了。大晚報的「火矩」不知怎地在不久以前刊了一期「戲劇園地」就不見下文。中華日報袁牧之主編的戲周刊，現在是全國戲劇刊物中比較可讀的一張，是稍稍能使人满意的。牠的前身是「戲劇與電影」，八月間方改爲「戲劇周刊」，九月</p>
<p>初才改爲現在的形式而擴大了篇幅。這刊物現正在進行改爲單行本的工作。此外如社會晚報的「戲劇版」，不久以前創刊的，大槪是因爲報紙銷路或該刊内容關係，至今還不曾引起人們的注意。</p>
<p>南京今年據說是「戲劇年」，但從指導劇運進展的戲劇刊物上考察起來，似乎也看不到有多少的成績。馬彥祥六月間在中央日報創刊了「戲劇周刊」，但這並不曾替南京的劇壇增加一點什麽力量，牠的内容可謂與南京劇界不生若何關係。這刊物是連劇評，消息也少登載的。十月間華報創刊了「舞　藝術」，「後來居上」，在内容的新鮮豐富及形式上，都是後者優於前者的。</p>
<p>在北方，劇刊是更是零落了。「故都」「文化城」的北平，没聽說今年有過像樣的戲劇刊物。天津庸報張鳴琦編的「戲劇周刊」，雖不時登載些可看的文章，但偌大的天津，也「只此一家」而巳。濟南山東民報閻哲吾編的「戲劇周刊」，篇幅旣狹小，内容亦不甚充實。其他值得提起的就很少見了。</p>
<p>在華南，廣州一向戲劇空氣是很　厚的。劇刊過去也曾出過不少，今　　分外地顯得襄頽零落而無所表現了。</p>
<p>（二）論爭一　｜今年劇壇上很少有什麽熱烈論爭的問題，這正反映着目今</p>

<p>— 南京大衆劇社演岀</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>劇園地的荒蕪。不過比較上也有幾件小的論爭值得一提的。首先是「高貴的人們」的出演所引起的諸家評論的不同。當時各報對於這個戲的批評據說是「應酬的頌揚多過於嚴正的批判」的，後來有李仁等四位先生在「演劇藝術」，繩夫先生在本刊，陸續地發表了兩篇比較嚴正的批評，指出作者不能完全「把握客觀的現實，將客觀的現實正確的形象化」，這雖似乎「苛刻」一點，但這缺點作者凌鶴先生是部分的接受了的，他巳在本劇的單行本中部分的改正過了。</p>
<p>其次，梅蘭芳赴俄問題，一直到現在都還在引起人們甚大的注意。有人極尖刻侮蔑地說梅博士赴俄是去「出堂差」，有人把俄國的邀請視爲「象徵派」的中國舊戲的勝利，並因而證明蘇俄寫實主義的没落。但又有人說這些實在都是淺見的皮相之談，說是蘇俄的邀請，乃是要參考中國戲的形式及其演出法，批判地接受東方封建藝術的遺產，好來建設新的演劇藝術。關於這個問題，中華日報戲周刊第十到第十六各期都曾發表過一些精闢的議論，曾引起人們極大的注意。</p>
<p>話劇播音問題也曾引起過一次小的論爭。在「戲周刊」和民報「戲劇運動」裏面，有幾位讀者的意見是不贊成當今的播音劇的，認爲這不過是一種「隔壁戲」，一種「摩登說書」或「新式說書」，前者並指出當今播音劇的空虚無聊。後來大晚報火炬上有一位先生主張播音劇有存在的價值，但這意見並未引起人們的注意。我個人覺得播音劇是有獨立成爲一種藝術的可能與必要，不過對於當今話劇播音界的無聊與烏烟瘴氣也是深致不满的。</p>
<p>大衆語與戲劇問題，似乎也曾引起過一度的討論，不過諸家的意見大都認爲戲劇若要大衆化，大衆語的利用乃是應有的結果，故並無何種相異的意見。</p>
<p>（三）演出總結算｜在這裏我想叙述一點本年度演出方面的事情。先從上海方面說起：</p>
<p>（一）遊藝會｜上海演出的特殊形態：上海劇人們有一種苦悶，就是有戲演不出。這自然有主客觀的兩重原因。於是他們就也不得不接受社會團體的遊藝會的邀請。今年比較像樣值得一提的游藝會，我以爲有下列幾次：</p>
<p>第一次是表年會請影評人凌鶴編導的「高貴的人們」的演出。這不是純粹的遊藝會，但也不是純粹的「公演」，所以我仍把牠歸到遊藝會裏來了。</p>
<p>第二次是女聲社的遊藝大會。這次共演了「壓迫」「夏夜之夢」「奇蹟」「三姊妹」等四劇。除「壓迫」外，其餘三劇大都係本年度的新作。其演出效果各報大都有好評。</p>
<p>第三次是麥倫中學遊藝會。這次共演了「雪中的行商」「揚子江暴風雨」「出走後的娜拉」「緊報」等四個劇本。「雪中的行商」因創作技術較次，成績不大好，「緊報」和「出走後的娜拉」則尙能使觀客满意，不過效果最好的還是「揚子江暴風雨」。這是一個新形式的歌劇，有充實的内容，精到的寫作技術和佳妙的演技。這恐怕是一九三四年最有成績的作品罷。</p>
<p>第四次是湖南同鄕會的遊藝會，話劇只有一幕「臨時演員」，其效果内容都還過得去。</p>
<p>（二）公演｜公演雖有幾次，但似乎都不曾引起人們的注意。五月底復旦劇社公演「瓊斯皇」，曾被評爲「兒戲」的「瓊斯皇」，其成績可想見一班。六月間商院劇社首次公演「父歸」和「重燃壞了的火」，這次公演有一種缺點，就是這兩個劇本不易號召觀衆。滬大國劇社曾演「第二夢」，也犯了這同一毛病。曁南劇社也在這時上演「好未必肯吧」「討漁稅」「潮」等，也不曾引起人們的注意。最近約翰劇社曾上演「名優之死」「王八」「劊子手」三劇，青年會中學青鐘劇社也演「蠢貨」「大盜」二劇，但都因限於學校小範圍，未能吸收廣大的觀衆。此外，上海各大學劇聯了在八月十六十七兩天上演「茂娜凡娜」「可憐的裴迦」「自救」「約翰曼莉」等四劇，尙能引起人們的注意。</p>
<p>一般社會劇團也同樣缺少表現。戲劇恊社自公演「怒吼吧中國」後卽無何表現，一九三三年的若干劇團也都不見形影了，春間雖有一個無名劇社上演過「洗衣老板與詩人」「誰是朋友」「鎖着的箱子」「捕鯨」「流浪者」「梅雨」「弟兄」「同居三家人」等數劇，規模雖不大，却也小有效果。又有個拓聲劇社演了歐尼爾的「天外」，總算努力。零零劇社演了「白茶」「一致」「活路」「賊」等幾個舊戲。螞蟻劇團在六月間会演了「父歸」，「月亮上升」，「金寳」等劇，尙得好評。這些劇社有的只是曇花一現，有的直到現在還無下文（聞螞蟻在籌備演出）。此外，如在各大中小學和女校的遊藝會中也時常要演一些話劇，但這些所謂話劇，有的固有「名家」客串，有的則不過是胡鬧一塲，演演文明戲而巳，這裏只得一槪略而不提。</p>
<p>在南京，今年是「戲劇年」，公演之事時有所聞。春間唐槐秋的中國旅行劇團曾在南京上演「梅蘿香」，票價賣到五元，營業尙佳。後來這劇團又聯合着中國文藝社，矛盾社，大衆劇社等九個團體上演了「壓迫」「蠢貨」「女人和狗」「樑上君子　等幾個老戲，但不曾引起大的注意。五月初，大衆劇社又上演「香稻米」，則頗哄動一時，報紙上批評甚多，可見此戲的號召力不小。中國戲劇恊會自演過「蠢貨」等劇之後在六月間又上演了蕭伯訥的「英雄與美人」，此戲内容頗受指摘，惟佈景尙佳。不久，南地劇社也演出了「莎樂美」。暑期中上海大地劇社曾往南京上演「名優之死」「慳吝人」「父師「賊「獄」等劇，尙能引起人們的注意。秋間青年劇社曾上演「獄」「小偷」「賣牛」等劇，大衆劇社曾上演「自殺者」「三升米」等劇，新葉劇社曾上演「買賣」「最後的擁抱」等劇，都是小規模的。</p>
<p>在北方，北平一向是戲劇空氣最濃厚的地方，今年却是分外的冷藩。公演只有八月間熊佛西張鳴琦等組織的北平戲劇學會演的「屠户」還值得一提，此外若「北國」「沙城」兩劇社雖都有公演計劃，但後來都無聲無間的自生自滅了。余上沅的小劇院，現只剩下一塊堂皇招牌的空殼子。唐槐秋的旅行劇團帶到北平來的又都是一些「梅蘿香」「女店主」「名優之死」「寄生草」「醉了」「白茶」「妒」「買賣」「蠢貨」之類的七八年前和三四年前的舊戲。今年北平的劇壇實在太荒蕪了。在天津，鸚鵡微沫兩劇社本年都曾演過戲，孤松劇社也演過醉了」和「殘疾」，但這都是不曾引起人們注意的。</p>
<p>在南方廣州，「一二八」紀念時話劇空氣曾甚蓬勃，當時有市美劇社的「二傷兵」，培正文藝研究會的「水杏林之死」，中大抗日劇社的「戰友」「活路」，省一職劇社的「夜快車」和四校聯合上演的「命令退却第二道防綫等數劇，都還好。三月間省一職又演「夜快車」和「最後一綫」，當時又有遠束中學話劇團組織台山遠征隊，演「買賣」「屏風後」「白茶」等劇，此後又有些學校劇社不重要的零碎公演。到八月民衆敎育館又演了「藝術家」「姊妹」「貞操」三劇，九一八時又演了「怒吼吧中國」，但劇詞大都經修改過。民敎館在八月間辦了一個戲劇研究所，現有學生六十餘人。</p>
<p>此外，全國各城市如杭州，蘇洲，鎭江，蕪湖，南昌，重慶，濟南，厦門····各地都有不重要的零星表演，這裏統擬略而不提了。</p>
<p>（四）農村戲劇運動｜熊佛西在定縣，谷劍塵在無錫，都多少在做着農村演劇的工作。熊先生的目的在培養農民的戲劇興趣與自動的從事戲劇活動，要從這裏收到平民敎育的效果。熊先生的努力誠然可佩，但他給農民的一些「喇叭」「屠户」「牛」「鋤頭健兒」之類的東西，却都不能救濟農民們的饑餓。雙十節「喇叭」的公演，雖然演出「新穎」，但影響到的也只是極少數的農民。本月二號第一個農民露天劇塲成立的紀念公演，其戲目如「喇叭」「醉鬼」「王四」「月亮上升」「窮途」「蘭芝與仲卿」「三條牛」「求婚」「狐仙廟」「屠户」等，多數都與農民的實生活缺少密切的關係。至於谷先生，對於「化裝演講」固然是確有研究，但在别的方面他却是還及不上熊先生的。</p>
<p>（五）所謂實騐劇社｜最後我要提到新近成立的王泊生主持的山東省立實騐劇院了。王泊生過去是幹過話劇的，後來成了「名票」「名伶」，今年還到上海來演過京戲，現在他是受知於山東藝術敎育界。他在那裏主要的是幹京戲，話劇方面雖有張鳴琦等人合作，但那却是列在不重要的地位的。</p>
<p>話說到這裏爲止。一九三四年是過去了，我們現在只有企望着一九三五年的更豐美的收穫。</p>

<p>以「人生」爲起點，很欣慰的可以看到中國影片技術上確有了顯著的進步，自然我們所要求的技術進步，决不是像歐美影片依賴圓熟的技術以誇大空虚的内容，我們所要求的是内容與形式的完全恊調。</p>
<p>一般的說，資本主義電影，常是形式超越了内容，相反的新興電影却没有新的技巧以表現新的内容，因爲適當的技巧還是在逐步發現之中，而資本主義電影技術，却巳是發展到最後階段了。</p>
<p>然而在這裏我不想談論整個的表現方法，祇想談談製片技術，卽是說在此不談，叙述法或者是織接法之類，而是談談收音技巧或攝影技巧而巳。</p>
<p>就有聲影片來說，就得提出「再生花」作爲例證。這裏是胡蝶一人兼飾姊妹二人，當姊妹二人在同一畫面出現的時候，在攝影技術上是很麻煩的。這除了一個畫面要分兩次攝影之外、同時還得用假胡蝶的背影。這種攝影方法，在满足觀衆的好奇心的一點上，自有其不小的效果，結果成爲「姊妹花」或「再生花」能够賣座的原因之一。而在攝影技巧上却是進步了的，譬如一般觀衆並不覺察它假的痕迹。再說到收音方面，「再生花」比較以前的中國聲片，確有顯著的進步。雖然在這裏没有充分的運用聲片的音響的效能，但是錄音的清晣，每一個字，每一句歌都能聽得明白，確是難能可貴的了。</p>
<p>再舉例就得提到「桃李刼」了。這一作品，固然有了很好的内容，而且是够得上稱爲有聲影片的運用了聲片的機能，但是因爲是第一次三友式錄音機的嘗試，聲音還不够清晣。（也許是聲帶洗印時的毛病。）攝影方面除了重攝的地方，不够清楚之外（如袁牧之在工塲中想到老婆生產的痛苦，在熔爐上面重攝的一個人睡在床上掙扎，並不能認清那是陳波兒。）其餘的調光或者是鏡頭角度，都是很有成績的。</p>
<p>此外再就默片方面，提出幾部談談。「女人」和「香雪海」的攝影之優秀。固不必說，而最近開映的如「神女」，如「重婚」，如「飛花村」，都可說明攝影師非常努力，誰都是加速度的深入研究，幾乎是在作品上極競爭。這一現象，無論如何是值得關心中國電影的人們之欣慰的。</p>
<p>至於佈景方面，一般的說，除了因爲限於資本，不能和所謂富麗堂皇的歐美影片抗衡之外，（其實在近於浪廢的偉大的佈景上做工夫，並不是正當的發展。）在佈景的構圖上或者是色澤上，好些影片都做到了内容所决定的程度，卽是說佈景師是很盡職的表現了作品的内容。</p>
<p>如上所述，中國影片的製片技術，最近確有顯著的進步。從前所說的没有新的形式以表現新的内容，現在是慢慢的克服這一困難了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c319">評「再生花」 <a href="#c319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>在「姊妹花」一片打破了我國影壇的沉寂空氣後，它幾乎成爲許多人所重視的驚人作品了；然而「姊妹花」之所以能如此賣座，固然是因爲劇怚能配言一般有閒小市民觀衆胃口的緣故，然而劇情的生動，故事的哀感，攝影和收音的清晣，以及胡蝶，宣景林，鄭小秋等的演出成功，都足以使本片震驚銀壇，突破空前賣座紀錄，却也並不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>現在我看了「姊妹花」的續集「再生花」不妨來隨便談談，好在談評影片一原是仁者見仁，智者見智，各抒所見罷了。</p>
<p>「姊妹花」在二實激於天倫而救出了大寳後，本來很可以就此結束了，可是現在却要再來一下節外生枝的「再生花：」似乎是多餘的了。這里寫二寳從獄中救出了大實後，徧會碰到許多磨難，並且硬生生地插進了二寳從前和一位革命青年的戀愛史，這也不免依舊是劇作者一貫的結尾乎法的表現。</p>
<p>本片劇情的雜亂，故事的平淡，實在是無可諱言的，如寫錢督辦，蕭團長，趙大等，固然是暴露了軍閥的醜惡行爲，但是道些在「姊妹花」中，我們不是巳經看見過了嗎？</p>
<p>在演出上，也有幾點不妥，如：（一）胡蝶因爲一人而兼飾了二個不同典型的人，所以就有很多地方的動作顯得機械式，尤其是幾個替身的塲面，對話也不能一致，這未免分散了表現的力量。（二）裏面的話劇氣味太濃厚，使觀衆感到彷徘在看文明戲。（三）剪接的不緊凑，也足以破壤了本劇的成功。</p>
<p>不過值得我們注意的地方也很多，如幾個小動作的適當，收音的清楚，對白的生動，利流，光綫的柔美，和各個演員的稱職，而導演者鏡頭角度的處理也很圓熟；這些都能使全劇的演出上獲得了不少的效果。</p>
<h3 id="c320">「飛花村」評 <a href="#c320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— 張大慧</p>
<p>無論是從内容或形式方面看，「飛花村」和「春潮」是有着很大的差異。前者不過是一部描寫戀愛故事的影片，後者却是部寫實主義的作品了。作者在這裏面顯示給我們看的是一幕經濟壓迫所造成的悲劇，阿華妻的被站長誘姦，和後來去做神女，都是說明了環境是處處受着經濟勢力支配的。</p>
<p>導演把全劇處理得非常的輕鬆明快，對於劇中人物個性是有顯着的描寫。開幕叙述飛花村景象的攝影，使我們看到一幅富有詩意的圖畫。演員方面高占非的個性剛强，胡萍愛夫愛子的表情，以及陳娟娟的天眞活潑，都很適合劇中的人物。王乃東的反派角色，秦桐的扮演老翁，亦是非常的成功。</p>
<p>最後的結局，我以爲站長的伏法和阿華的開釋，是陷入了善惡果報的公式。不如以站長的逍遙法外和阿華的被槍决作爲結局，是更能使全劇來得緊張和悲痛的。</p>
<h3 id="c321">「再生花」我評 <a href="#c321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— 費念祖</p>
<p>自從「姊妹花」公映，打破了開映日期的記錄而後，使素來被人輕視的國產有聲片，也引起國人們的重視了。</p>
<p>現在，這繼「姊妹花」之後的「再生花」，又在新光公映了，但是當我看完了本片，却感覺至本片並不是一個十分成功的作品。導演鄭正秋雖然是非常的努力，可是他　大的缺點，就是不能利用有聲電影的特殊技巧，來加重全劇的悲歡成分。同時對於觀衆的水準，也不能略爲提高，仍是和「姊妹花」同樣，祇是以曲折離奇的情節，來博得觀衆的眼涙而巳。</p>
<p>關於演員，胡蝶的大寳二寳，仍有其物殊的成績，雖然較「姊妹花」中並没有付麽進步。宣景林的老婦，演來維妙維肖，顯然是有了很大的進步。鄭涉秋總算是相當的盡職。譚志遠，朱秋痕，王獻齋等，也非常賣力。其餘配角尚佳。</p>

<h3 id="c322">「風流寡婦」秘珍 <a href="#c322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>「風流寡婦」女主角珍妮麥唐納，在該片中</p>
<p>所唱歌曲爲「維利亞夜有（Vilia）由大玪師樂勃洛关氏配奏；「奈何今宵」（TonightWiilTeachtoForget）係在陽臺上唱者；及「寡婦風流「（Widovys　Are　Gay）。而男主角希佛萊則唱「麥克茜去」（I　am　GoingMaxims）；「女人！女人！女人！」（GirlsGirlsGirls）；「吾王聖明」（TheKingCanDoNoWrong）。兩人合唱者爲「兩情脈脈！」（Nit　a　Wird）</p>
<p>麥唐納領導！「使館舞」，「風流寡婦胡旋舞」外，更有十九世紀稱爲惱人春色的巴黎「可可舞」（Can　Can　Dance）等。</p>
<p>大琴師樂勃洛夫的提琴，稱爲世界無雙。它不特是千年古物，它獨能够奏出雙聲（Bilingual）。大槪無論那樣珍貴的提琴，祗能發出一種高音（Tenor）或低音（Bass），而樂琴却能够奏出雌雄雙音。片中麥克茜Maxims舞館美女，巳竭好萊塢粉黛之選，共計十有四人，紐約一省佔有五席，其餘九席則屬諸他省，可見佳人難再行之意。</p>
<p>「風流寡婦」中，技術上有兩種新的嘗試。一爲織錦式的交舞（BasketWeaveDance）。舞者雙方均服各色彩衣，低昂變易，左盤右旋，極蝴蝶穿花之態，爲歷來舞史上之創見。一爲音的回憶（Muicai　Retro　pect　）。普通銀幕上回憶前摩的方式，採用溶出或溶入法（Dissove），使舊影歷歷重現，但本片中伯爵回想舊事一節，破除陳法以音韻的情調代替。這是以聲代色的新技術。</p>
<h3 id="c323">「漩渦」更名「蛇蝎美人」 <a href="#c323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>「漩渦」是楊小沖「良宵」後的得意傑作。這一部戲由陳燕燕，張翼主演，梁賽珍客串。因爲他們所扮的角色都能得到個性的發揮，所以這部戲有了優越的成就。</p>
<p>陳燕燕在這裏表演絶佳，是自不待言，而所最足使人驚奇的是梁賽珍與張翼都有了空前的收獲。據一般人論，梁賽珍在這片裏好像巳成了一個新的梁賽珍，而張翼因爲在這裏做戲的機便獨多，便使他造成自入聯華以來最成功的一部戲。</p>
<p>「漩渦」不久卽可與社會相見。但這「漩渦」的片名似須要更改一個更好的片名，據聞擬更名爲「蛇蝎美人」云。</p>

<h3 id="c324">風流寡婦（The　Merry　Widow）（六） <a href="#c324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— 素華</p>
<p>講到這裏，唐爾納就轉過身子對着陪審官道：「我是有罪了。除了犯到賣國，失職等罪以外，我還犯了受愚的罪。我這一次的命運，可給男人們一個大敎訓。當一個男人能够擁着百十個女人享樂的時候，倘苦若他竟去單獨戀愛一個女子，他就是愚蠢極了，應該處罰死刑。」他說完了，旁聽的人都羣情洶湧的高喊着「唐爾納」。國王的待臣立刻奔到宫裏報告審判的情形，說唐爾納自認犯罪。國王聽了，他知道國家快要破產了，他和王后巳在收拾軟預備逃走。正在忙得不可開交的時候，侍臣又喘着氣跑上來說道：「那···那寡婦要到監獄裏去探望唐爾納。」國王和王后聽見了，就立即命人到柏夫那裏去，將睡得昏昏的柏夫叫醒了，叫他請監獄官和閣員們來會議。國王現着喜色笑道：「這計劃是不會失敗的了。」</p>
<p>在灰色的監獄長廊裏，蘇麗亞一步一步的走着。獄吏在一邊問着道：「小姐，你是隊長的朋友嗎？」「不是怎樣的朋友。」「是你的親屬嗎？」「不是。」但是你以前認得人的，是嗎？」「是的。」「那麽恐怕你現在不認識他了。他巳完全改變了。」他們一面談着，一面走着，一回兒巳經踱到監房門口了。獄吏開了門，她戰慄着的走了進去。裏面除了一只睡订以外就没有别的東西。那時候有一只老鼠竟跑過她的足背。這一驚就把她嚇得跑到床上去。接着唐爾納就走進來。他像很有趣的望着她。她在床上很難爲情的道：「對不住，我是被老鼠追進來的。」唐爾納笑着道：「那老鼠把仍老遠的追來，眞不得了。」好扳着面孔說道：「你不要以爲我到這裏來···」唐爾納急插着說：「看我嗎？不，一定不是。」她答道：「是的，我是來看你的。」她說完了就想術出外面，可是門早就鎖着了。她用力去推，他也來帮着推。但是没有結果。聽聽外面一點聲音都没有。其實那個時候國王正領着一班人在外面靜靜的聽着呢。蘇麗亞惱眘說道：「你是否賄賂了獄吏把我關在這裏？」唐爾納也說道：「你一定賄賂了獄吏把你自己關在這裏的。」蘇麗亞喊道：「我可再不能受你的侮辱了。」「那麽你爲什麽不出去呢？」他問她。那時她眞没有法想。過了一會，那牆上的小窗開了，有人將香櫝酒和玻璃杯子送了進來。他們是互相看着一些辦法没有。唐爾納想了一會說道：「你又没有賄賂獄吏，那一定是他把我們關在一起的，我們都被騙了。」蘇麗亞也說道：「那麽我們怎樣辦呢？」唐爾們不要親熱好了。」「是的，我們不要親熱」。她也這樣說。「我們不要上他的當，我們兩人相恨着，怎能使我們相愛呢？」她續着的說。「好的，我們不要上他的當。」說完了唐爾納就去小窗拿酒喝。兩人同喝着。一回兒醉人的琴聲曫了，兩人開始跳舞了。當他您緊要吻她的時候，她還倔强着要避開，可是當他喊一聲「老鼠來了」她急着跑上床去的時候，他是微笑着坐在她的身邊。兩人的目光互相交流，表示着愛的默許。同時那小小的窗門開了，現出那微笑着的主敎。當他宣佈承認他俩是正式夫婦的話還没有說完時，蘇麗亞的紅唇巳在等候着他的熱吻。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e12">Review of World Economic Trends in the Past Year (Part 1) - Tong <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Let us examine the course of world economy in the past year. In a word, it can be described as entering a period of extreme decline. Since the breakdown of the World Economic Conference, the economic policies of various countries have diverged and followed extreme paths. Countries have successively adopted economic blockade policies, making this policy the darling of the times. Thus, tariff wars and boycotts of goods have been implemented to benefit domestic industries and exclude the intrusion of foreign economic forces. Since then, the organization of economic blockades has become increasingly strict. For example, the United Kingdom convened representatives from its colonies that attended the World Economic Conference to hold an Imperial Conference and reaffirm the Ottawa Agreement, which shows its efforts in economic blockade. The Netherlands also abandoned its free trade policy and placed the Dutch East Indies under the control of its national economy. The United States also contacted and cooperated with South American countries to conclude new commercial treaties. These are all obvious examples. As for its impact on the domestic aspects of various countries, it can be said that (1) it has activated the industrial sector. Since the breakdown of the World Economic Conference, various countries have continued to implement policies that they believe are most suitable for the actual national economy, supplemented by low-interest monetary policies to create price inflation, making the industrial sector tend to be active. For example, the production volume of the basic steel industry in various countries has increased. This is one example. (2) There has been price inflation. The state of price fluctuations varies slightly from country to country. In countries with a gold standard monetary system, it is weaker. In countries that have abandoned it, it is stronger. In terms of the overall world trend, it has been trending towards significant inflation in the second half of 1933. It has not changed in 1934. Price inflation is nothing more than a prosperity policy of expanding finance and disposing of accumulated goods, indirectly helping to increase the purchasing power of agricultural countries and farmers in general. Therefore, the basis for reflecting the increase in purchasing power can be said to be political rather than economic. Let us consider the situation of the major countries in the world.</p>
<p>On the agricultural country side, the extreme exhaustion caused by the economic downturn suffered by farmers in general was at its peak in the second half of 1933. Since then, it has gradually eased with price inflation. In the United States, from the beginning of the financial panic in 1929 to December 1932, the price of agricultural products fell by 60%. Although the government urgently implemented its active agricultural relief policy through the New Deal, it was still around 20%. The prices of agricultural products, especially cereals, are not easy to raise to the level of general prices for political reasons. Looking at the American agricultural relief movement, the degree of active efforts has been clearly shown to us. However, the effect achieved is still so small. It is easier to imagine the economic situation of the rural areas of other countries.</p>
<p>Since the general economy of the world has recently shown phenomena of price inflation and industrial activity, then in principle, commodity trade should be expected to develop. However, what the facts tell people is very different. Countries want to achieve the perfection of their economic blockade policies internally, actively promoting production and encouraging exports, while setting up tariff barriers externally to exclude foreign goods. International trade is in a situation where it is only possible to shrink under the heavy economic obstacles. In 1933, international trade saw exports of 12 billion U.S. dollars and imports of 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, a decrease of 5.6% in exports and 22.3% in imports compared to the previous year. Although there are no official statistics available for this year, it is feared that the results will not be very good.</p>

<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Strictly Prevents the Remnants of Liu's Bandits from Fleeing into the War Zone</p>
<p>[P Telegram Instructs Four Counties' Militia to Suppress Bandits in Mentougou Area, No Trace of Bandits Found]</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandit gang under Liu Guitang was pursued by the newly formed special police force from Fangshan on the afternoon of the 28th and fled towards Tongxian. That night, they encountered the Tongxian Security Regiment in the Xiaohongmen Yongledian area and a fierce battle broke out. The entire city of Tongxian was on alert overnight. On the morning of the 29th, the special police force pursued them, and the bandits fled towards Pinggu County. The provincial government, fearing that the bandit gang would flee into the war zone and join forces with the bandits in Yutian, specially telegraphed the militia of Pinggu, Sanhe, Tongxian, and Bindi counties to cooperate in preventing them. It is reported that the bandit gang, fearing pursuit by government troops, released all the kidnapped hostages along the way to move more quickly. (Special Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Liu Guitang's remnants fled to Mentougou yesterday, about 200 people were found in the Mayu Village Dahuitang area. The 53rd Army of Wan Fulin's forces immediately sent a Tang regiment to suppress them. The bandits fled as soon as they saw the troops arriving. Until dusk, the Tang regiment continued to search the northwest area of Dahuitang. There were small contacts wherever the unit went, and as a result, the bandits were defeated and fled in a panic towards Zhaizhang. As of this afternoon, there was no trace of bandits in the Mentougou and Shijingshan areas. In addition to dispatching two more regiments to protect the electric light company and power plant in Shijingshan, the 53rd Army is now stationed with mounted infantry teams in Dahuitang, Mayu Village, Mentougou, and other places to strictly prevent the bandits from returning. The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered Lin Yanbin, the director of the Western Suburbs Office, to lead the police and security teams to conduct strict defenses in the Xiangshan Sanjiadian area. (Special Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 200 remnant bandits of Liu Guitang suddenly appeared in Shimen, southwest corner of Tongxian, the banner marked as the "Number One Regiment in the World". After the authorities were informed, Shang Zhen, commander of the 32nd Army, immediately dispatched a regiment from the troops stationed in Tongxian to suppress them. Another regiment was transferred from Nanyuan to Tongxian for security. Yin Rugeng said this morning that the Liu bandits' harassment near Tongxian has been surrounded and suppressed by the garrison troops and can be easily resolved. More than 100 bandits were found in Yingshang Village, west of Fangshan County, last month. They burned, killed, looted, and committed all kinds of evils. Fortunately, they were surrounded and dispersed by the Fangshan and Laishui County Security Regiments. Unexpectedly, the bandits gathered together and suddenly reappeared when the county police and security regiments were unprepared. They passed through villages, looting as if in an uninhabited area. The regimental police are contacting neighboring villages' police forces to actively fight back. (Special Dispatch on the 29th)</p>

It is no longer possible to complete the abolition by the end of the year in accordance with the departmental orders. The Department of Finance telegraphed the ministry to request an extension of three months. (Special Dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>Japan Officially Declares the Destruction of the Naval Treaty, Breaking the Balance of Power in the Pacific</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to responsible sources, Saito, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, following the instructions of his government, will submit the notification of Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty to US Secretary of State Hull at 12:00 on Saturday (Washington time). (Reuters Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed the Japanese ambassadors to England, France, and Italy, instructing them to notify the governments of their respective countries of Japan's abandonment of the Washington Treaty and to strongly argue Japan's disarmament policy. (Japanese Allied Press Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japan today formally abandoned the naval limitation treaty. The Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, today handed over the order from Tokyo to abandon the treaty to the State Department. The full text is one hundred words long. Saito visited Secretary of State Hull this afternoon in accordance with diplomatic practice and handed over the Tokyo instructions in person. The Japanese Embassy also released this statement to the press at the same time. This statement is nothing more than a restatement of Saito's previous verbal expressions to Hull. The US government did not express surprise at this, but the official impression given by the statement is very deep. The fourteen-year balance of power in the Pacific created by the self-concluded agreement of the three countries may be washed away by this. But the government hopes to conclude a new treaty. If this is hopeless, observers have expressed that politicians and diplomats can use their remarks to maintain peace in the Far East. Japan indicated in its note that after 1936, Japan does not want to be restricted by the naval ratio of 5:5:3. This alone is enough to show the spirit of challenging the treaty. Officials claim that whether there will be a naval arms race in 1936 will depend on whether Japan will engage in building warships after the naval treaty expires. Officials secretly expressed great disappointment, but on the surface, they declared that the US policy is to stabilize the public opinion of major countries, so they will avoid any provocative statements or actions to weaken the possibility of concluding a new treaty after the expiration of the naval treaty. It is said that Japan's declaration of abolishing the treaty will increase discussions related to opening up naval and army bases in the Pacific, but the government denies this discussion. It is learned that naval officers generally believe that although Japan has abandoned the naval treaty, the United States will still maintain a peaceful attitude and will continue to work to obtain an understanding in 1935. Most Japanese newspapers declare that the main issue in 1935 will be related to the coordination between Italy and France. (National Telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Saito to the United States, following the government's order, met with US Secretary of State Hull at noon on the 29th (2 a.m. on the 30th Japan time) and formally handed over the Japanese government's notice of abolishing the Washington Treaty as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I am honored to inform you on behalf of my government as follows. The Government of Japan, in accordance with Article 23 of the Treaty relating to the Limitation of Naval Armament signed in Washington on February 6, 1922, hereby notifies the Government of the United States of its intention to renounce the said Treaty, and therefore the said Treaty shall cease to have effect after December 31, 1936.

<h3 id="e29">Aims of Tokyo's Statement <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government issued a statement on the aims of abolishing the Washington Treaty on the afternoon of the 29th as follows: During the preparatory negotiations for naval disarmament, the Japanese government cooperated with the countries concerned to consolidate Japan's national defense and to fully exert the achievements of disarmament, so as to establish a fair and appropriate new agreement, and thereby avoid the threat of aggression between major naval powers, and at the same time hope to reduce the burden on the people as much as possible. Based on this view, the Japanese government, as a result of careful consideration of the root points that can be used as a new disarmament agreement, has decided on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The existing naval treaty is considered to be formed in a way that the military strength between major naval powers is unequal. Referring to the current situation of the progress of ships, weapons, aircraft, etc., it is learned that the above-mentioned method is extremely difficult to ensure the consolidation of Japan's national defense in the future. Therefore, in the new disarmament agreement, the above-mentioned ratioism should be replaced with the common maximum limit of the military strength that each country can possess, so that it can be used as a method of agreement.</p>
<p>(2) (A) In order to give play to the spirit of military reduction, the above-mentioned limit must be reduced as much as possible. (B) At the same time, in order to make it difficult for countries to attack and easy to defend, the military power of attack should be completely abolished or reduced as much as possible, and the military power of defense should be prepared. Following the above-mentioned main points, to draw up a new treaty is most in line with the original intention of military reduction, and can thereby ensure the permanent consolidation of national defense of various countries. This is Japan's fundamental position, and it is also expressed to the countries concerned. However, the Washington Naval Limitation Treaty not only recognizes the types of ships dedicated to attack, which the Japanese government intends to completely abolish, as being retained, but also stipulates the inequality of military strength between major naval powers by ratioism. Therefore, the continuation of the treaty is indeed impossible for the Japanese government to accept in accordance with the fundamental policy. The inferior ratio being regulated by it is even more damaging to the self-esteem of the Japanese people, so it has never given satisfaction to the people forever. Therefore, the Japanese government now awaits the end of the treaty in Showa 11, that is, the initial validity period stipulated in the treaty has now been reached, and at the same time considers it an appropriate time to abolish it. In accordance with the provisions of the treaty, it is necessary to exercise the notification of abolition by the end of this year. The above-mentioned intentions of the Japanese government have already been notified to the British and American sides in advance. However, because the Japanese side hopes that this preparatory negotiation will make every effort to be effective and make a plan to generate results, it is intended to cooperate sincerely with the countries concerned to exercise the notification of abolition, and then cooperate to promote the establishment of a new treaty, which can be considered appropriate. Therefore, the Japanese government has explained the above-mentioned reasons to all the countries concerned and advised them to jointly notify the abolition of the treaty, but all countries have not agreed. Now, the Japanese government has decided to notify the US government in writing of its intention to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty alone, in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the treaty. This is its origin. Since the above-mentioned notice of abolition has been clearly stipulated in the treaty, the rights of all contracting countries in the treaty are already obvious. Self-evident, the Japanese government's measures this time regarding the abolition of the Washington Treaty are to expect to establish a new treaty that is the most fair and appropriate and the most in line with the spirit of disarmament, and this is the inevitable conclusion of the above-mentioned Japanese side in accordance with the fundamental policy. Even after the Japanese government has notified the abolition of the treaty, it is still prepared to make friendly consultations with the countries concerned, in order to establish a new agreement that is fair and reasonable. This is a heartfelt hope that never ends. As for intentions such as promoting military expansion or harming international peace, it is not within Japan's dreams. The fact that Japan is demanding the complete abolition or a great reduction in ships of attack, in order to establish the principle of non-threatening and non-aggression, should have revealed its intention. If the countries concerned are humble and frank, and think carefully about this point, they will be able to understand the appropriateness of the Japanese proposal. Therefore, if the countries can agree to completely abolish the attacking ships, or because the existing forces are greatly reduced due to the large reduction, and at the same time the common maximum limit of the military strength they possess can be agreed, then the countries will not be threatened by any country, and ensure their sense of security. Only then can a permanent peaceful relationship be established. This is what the Japanese government believes. (Japanese Allied Press Dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>(London) All sectors of the British people deeply regret Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. The biggest step towards military reduction has become a pie in the sky. Public opinion is that Japan has the inherent right to abolish the treaty, but Britain has made great contributions to the treaty, saving the signatory countries a great deal of naval expenditure. This move by Japan will not only affect naval disarmament, but also general disarmament. However, Britain still intends to continue to make the greatest possible efforts to complete an agreement to replace the Washington Treaty. (Reuters Dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Although Londoners deeply regret Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, Reuters learned that Britain does not regard this as a tendency to break the entire collective peace system. Japan's willingness to abolish the other two important treaties that are the same as the Washington Treaty organization, namely the Nine-Power Treaty and the Four-Power Treaty, does not indicate that the Pacific belongs to Japan. However, Japan's abolition of one of these three treaties will make political disputes more likely to be raised when naval talks are reopened in the future. (Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) As for France, it is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not anxious about Japan's move, because France has expressed dissatisfaction with many points of the treaty since the day it was signed. According to news from diplomatic visitors, the main reason why the French government does not agree with Japan's abolition of the Washington Treaty is that France is unwilling to advocate the termination of any treaty for world peace. France now seems to be putting forward its own specific suggestions, which are naturally related to its position on Italy. France does not seem to be satisfied with absolute equality with Italy.

<p>Tokyo's Instructions Reject the British Plan, The Atmosphere for Reopening Negotiations Is Getting Darker</p>
<p>(London) The atmosphere for the resumption of the London naval talks is now getting darker day by day. The US representative is scheduled to return to the United States tonight. The US side has recently expressed its intention in earnest. If the Japanese side does not actively change its views today and make future discussions have a more hopeful basis, then the US representative does not want to come to the talks again or participate in the naval conference. Now the US representative has returned home, and the impression he has is that the Japanese side's views have not changed from beginning to end. Then, will the Japanese view change after all? It will be decided by the results of the negotiations between Britain and Japan. Although the Japanese representative Yamamoto has not yet received instructions to return home, he may not stay in London for long. US representative Standley hosted a banquet for Japanese representative Yamamoto yesterday. After the meal, he talked with Yamamoto alone for half an hour. Yamamoto showed him the instructions from Tokyo that he received this week, and it is heard that this instruction is a rejection. Yamamoto then met with Chappell, a naval officer of the British Navy Department. In the evening, Cregie of the British Foreign Office went to see US representative Davis to see him off and told him that the United Kingdom will continue to negotiate with Tokyo through diplomatic channels, hoping to establish a basis for future discussions. When Davis heard this, he wished him success. The US representative boarded the ship and left England at 8:30 tonight. The US representative believes that the naval conference may not be held before 1936. If there is no real hope of concluding a treaty in the current situation, it is useless to hold the meeting. Reuters has learned that the US side believes that Tokyo's recent instructions have given a definite rejection to the British compromise plan to have all parties declare their warship building procedures.

<p>(Special Dispatch from Shenyang) Due to the breakdown of the recent naval disarmament conference, the Japanese puppet regime is frantically preparing for war, actively provoking the Soviet Union. Military disputes frequently occur along the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border. The prelude to a world war has manifested in the intensified international espionage war. Japanese spies have been discovered in British Singapore and the American Samoa, among other places. An attaché at the Japanese embassy in Tokyo, named Takemiya, used a woman to gather military intelligence. British and American journalists stationed in Yokohama have been arrested on suspicion of espionage. However, the most active area for espionage is undoubtedly the Northeast. In Shenyang alone, there are over thirty foreign-affiliated intelligence agencies. In Hunchun, along the Russian-"Manchukuo" border, Andong, along the "Manchukuo"-Korean border, and Dalian port, several people are searched and detained daily on suspicion of espionage. Such phenomena are not uncommon; they are inevitable on the eve of a world war.</p>

<p>Deepening Contradictions of Imperialism - Pacific War Imminent</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda published an article on the recent world situation entitled "Preparations for War in the Pacific," stating, "The failure of the Washington Naval Treaty was predetermined by the development of imperialist contradictions, and the treaty's conclusion was itself a result of these contradictions. In the past fourteen years, the balance of power among imperialist nations has fundamentally changed. Since the rise of German fascism, the threat of future war has permeated Europe. Simultaneously, Anglo-American conflicts have intensified. Japanese imperialism is seizing this opportunity to establish its dominance in the Western Pacific. War in the Pacific is now more imminent than ever. The nations that will participate in this war do not misunderstand its widespread nature." The newspaper firmly believes that the fate of future naval conferences is already in serious doubt. (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Current Situation is Dangerous</p>
<p>(New York) Recently, many American newspapers have argued that, given the current general situation in the Pacific, the Philippines should become an American dominion to avoid the dangers of complete independence. The American Senate investigation team currently in the Philippines seems to hold the same view. As for Philippine Senate President Quezon, while he supports adopting a dominion system, he requests that the United States not sever trade relations with the Philippines as stipulated in the Philippine Independence Act (i.e., taxing goods imported from the Philippines into the United States on the same basis as foreign goods) and that close economic ties with the Philippines be allowed. The American Senate investigation team's response to this Philippine hope has been evasive, likely because powerful American economic circles oppose it. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Hong Kong) Philippine Senate President Quezon, on his way back to the Philippines from the United States via Hong Kong, told people, "Even if the United States withdraws from the Philippines, I cannot imagine Japan occupying the island, as feared by the Hearst newspapers.

<p>A Key to Central European Peace, New Progress in Italian-French Negotiations</p>
<h3 id="e47">Both Countries' Difficulties in Principle Are Reached Compromise, Laval's Rome Trip Not Far Off, Guaranteeing Austria's Independence by Six-Nation Treaty <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Whether Foreign Minister Laval will go to Rome is still unknown, but newspapers here all say that French-Italian negotiations have made satisfactory progress, and that the Foreign Minister may visit Rome in early January. Some newspapers even mentioned the Italian reception procedures. Le Petit Parisien reported: "The current French-Italian negotiations aim to ensure the security of Central Europe and the independence of Austria. This is what the world expects, and smooth progress is expected soon. After consulting with the Little Entente countries and the Austrian government yesterday evening, the French Foreign Ministry sent an important document to the Italian government through the French ambassador to Italy. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that tomorrow or even today will be an important date for a decision."</p>
<p>L'Echo de Paris reported that the document sent by the French Foreign Ministry to the Italian government proposed that the neighboring countries of Austria, namely Italy, Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, conclude a protocol guaranteeing the independence of Austria. If Germany and Hungary raise reservations among these five countries, then Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia should first sign the protocol, and Germany and Hungary can join later when they express their agreement. This is the first step. The second step, which requires Mussolini's support, is roughly as follows: Countries signing the protocol guaranteeing Austria's independence should also guarantee each other's security if their borders are adjacent. Thus, Italy and Yugoslavia must guarantee each other's security. By analogy, the Central European Security Pact can be extended to Central and Eastern Europe, and the Northeast European Security Pact can be linked to the Balkan Pact, forming a security network covering the entire European continent. In addition, L'Echo de Paris also learned that Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu seem to have accepted this French proposal, which is considered extremely gratifying, as people are deeply concerned that Laval may have neglected the Little Entente countries. Now that Beneš and Titulescu have accepted, this concern can be dispelled. In short, given the current situation between Italy and the Little Entente countries, France can approach Italy on the one hand without alienating its allies on the other. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The tense situation between France and Italy now shows signs of ending. Although the date of French Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Rome has not yet been set, it appears to be not far off. Le Journal de Paris even said that Laval will leave on January 2, indicating that French-Italian contact has made good progress. The French Foreign Minister's visit to Rome indicates that the most difficult issues between the two countries have been resolved, at least in principle. Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with the French ambassador to Italy. It is said that the French ambassador then informed the Italian Prime Minister of Laval's latest proposal. The purpose of French policy is not only to seek peace in Austria but also to seek security in the Danube region, so that the dispute between Italy and the Little Entente countries over the Austrian issue can be resolved. According to reliable sources, a draft treaty guaranteeing Austria's independence will soon be signed in Rome by Italy, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Hungary. The above-mentioned countries are all Austria's neighbors on the ground. If Germany and Hungary wish to temporarily reserve their attitude, other countries will sign immediately and allow Germany and Hungary to join later. Although France and Romania do not border Austria, they will also be invited to participate in this treaty. The signatory countries will guarantee the integrity of their borders to each other. The most serious obstacle to this plan is whether Hungary will abandon its policy of revising the treaty, and whether Italy can accept a plan that stabilizes the existing borders. Current negotiations focus on the European situation, but the cession of African land has also been discussed. However, the land that France will cede is a strip of land in the southern part of Libya and a part of the northern part of French Somaliland. This plan also stipulates reciprocal tariff and commodity quota measures. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Three Hundred People Arrested, Most Released - The National Defense Force Quietly Observes Domestic Political Developments</p>
<p>(Berlin) Responsible parties acknowledged that in the recent purge movement, three hundred people who had committed immoral acts were arrested, but two hundred of them have been released. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, foreign newspapers have reported that internal disturbances have reemerged in Germany, and the government has executed many people to "maintain public order." Officials here do not want to take any stance on such news, only making informal statements that although three hundred people have been arrested recently, none have been executed, and two hundred of them have already been released. Berlin is absolutely calm and there is no sign of panic. The preventive measures taken by the military authorities seem to be able to immediately quell any disturbances in the event of a coup. Moreover, under the current circumstances, any attempt to instigate a coup against the current system must have the support of the National Defense Force. However, the current system is quite capable of fulfilling some wishes of the National Defense Force. The National Defense Force continues to quietly observe the progress of domestic politics. In addition, new actions of the purge are currently underway. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Performance Report for 1934</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Accession of Soviet Russia and Other Countries is Somewhat Satisfactory, Technical Cooperation with China is Good, The Resolution of the Hungarian-Yugoslav Dispute is Commendable <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations has recently completed and published a report on the achievements of the League of Nations over the past year, expressing hope for the future without being overly optimistic. The report stated that 1933 was a difficult year, and 1934 also presented many difficulties, as the disarmament conference had stalled and relations between countries had regressed economically. However, several matters were satisfactory: first, Soviet Russia, Afghanistan, and Ecuador all joined the League of Nations as member states; second, the Saar plebiscite was prepared in a fair and methodical manner; and third, the extremely thorny dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia was resolved. All of these are commendable. The report concludes that various technical organizations are deeply beneficial to the work of the League of Nations. Therefore, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, then Chairman of the Executive Council of the League of Nations for this year, said after the completion of the League of Nations' performance report, "Judging from the facts of the year, we are not disappointed with the League of Nations' conclusions. Because there is currently a concrete and positive force and trend in the world that is resisting the forces that could disrupt international political life and preventing them from doing harm. The concrete and positive force and trend that we should first mention is the League of Nations." Among the international political issues in 1934, there was also the South American dispute. The report was pleased that the dispute between Peru and Colombia over Leticia had been resolved. As for the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia over the Chaco, the League of Nations has been working continuously to resolve it, and the outcome has been that all member states have agreed to ban the shipment of arms to the belligerent countries. The report expressed support for the League of Nations' technical cooperation with China, stating that the League of Nations Intellectual Cooperation Organization has been assisting in the job placement of Chinese intellectuals and technicians. The Chinese government has decided to establish such job placement offices in Nanjing and the West to make it easier for Chinese students studying in Europe and the United States to receive vocational training to meet the current needs of China's economic construction. The League of Nations has also assisted China in carrying out various health and veterinary projects, while the transport and transportation agencies are focusing on highways and water conservancy in cooperation with the National Economic Council of China. The League of Nations also sent Dr. Rajchman to China last year as a technical liaison officer between the League of Nations and China. Dr. Rajchman's term expired in August of this year, and he prepared a report on the technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Council's League of Nations and China Technical Cooperation Committee on March 17 of this year, submitting it to the League of Nations' technical agencies. His report recognized that the cooperation was very good. Regarding the problem of narcotics trafficking, the League of Nations report stated that the 1931 Geneva Convention (restricting the manufacture of narcotics and suppressing their distribution) has been strictly and universally implemented by all parties, so the quantity of legal narcotics trafficking has gradually decreased. The League of Nations is now working to prepare a draft convention to punish the illegal trafficking of narcotics. The League of Nations has been able to lay a foundation for this matter, which is the basis for establishing international conventions, so that all countries in the world can be covered by its scope.

Dr. Adachi was one of Japan's most famous diplomats and legal scholars, having served as an envoy to Mexico, Belgium, and France, among other countries, and was a key figure in the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations for nine years.

After three years, he was appointed Secretary of the Japanese Legation in Paris, and he had already earned the reputation of an international law expert. After returning to Japan from Europe, he lectured on law and continued to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1912, he was sent as an envoy to Mexico, and in 1917, he was sent to Belgium, and was one of the Japanese representatives at the Paris Peace Conference, and joined the committee to draft the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice.

<p>Twelve Ships Cease Operations</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign crew members of the Hong Wah Steamer went on strike on the evening of the 29th. The Hong Wu and Hong Jiang steamers have both ceased operations. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese Seamen's Union and the Chinese Marine Engineers' Union resolved this afternoon to go on strike at midnight tonight. This action by the two unions is due to the fact that monthly salaries are too low to cover living expenses. Thirteen river steamers will be affected. There are forty British crew members. Initially, someone came forward to mediate, but unexpectedly, Sun Boming (transliteration), a wealthy shipowner in Hong Kong, dismissed four senior crew members of the Yutong (transliteration) ship and replaced them with Norwegians and Germans. As a result, the unrest grew. The two unions are now discussing inviting crew members of other ships with wages recognized by the unions to join the strike. The two unions have also ordered striking crew members to stay on board to protect the owner's property, in fact fearing that crew members who are not members of the unions will take over the ships. The ship owners are attempting to request the Hong Kong government to intervene, but have been refused. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although mediated by a fair group, the Chinese Seamen's Union still went on strike tonight, affecting forty employees and twelve ships. The owners of nine ships have agreed to pay wages as originally stipulated. The real reason for this strike is that the mail steamer Yueton dismissed four British crew members and hired an unemployed Norwegian shipowner as a replacement. A representative of the Seamen's Union stated that the strike would continue until the four are reinstated. Although other shipowners have agreed to pay wages, this is unrelated to the matter. According to reliable sources, key officers on inland river steamers only receive a monthly salary of 200 yuan, which is lower than the monthly salary of a female typist in Hong Kong. The shipping situation after the strike is extremely poor, and the situation is becoming more chaotic because some crew members are willing to accept wages lower than the standard wage. Some poorly paid crew members are unwilling to protest for fear of losing their jobs. It is heard that some captains and engineers only receive a monthly salary of 170 yuan.

<p>Bandits Seize the Opportunity to Plunder, Devastating the Area. Security Forces and Local Militias are Irreconcilable. Authorities Decide to Adopt a Radical Solution.</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Yutian militia conflicts have reignited, devastating the area. Authorities are currently devising a solution to alleviate the people's suffering. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The conflict between the Yutian militias has both long-term and recent causes. The local security force was originally reorganized from Shi Yousan's old troops. At that time, they were transferred from Qinhuangdao to Yutian as an unavoidable measure under certain circumstances. Shortly after their deployment, they clashed with the local militia. After a month of disputes, Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Commissioner of the Jimi District, went to mediate, and the provincial government reassigned Han Dianbang as the commander of the security force, barely resolving the crisis. However, the resentment between the militias was not fundamentally resolved. After Han Dianbang took office, the force and the militias did not get along, eventually causing trouble and driving Han away. As a result, the security force and the militia became enemies again. The security force has over 2,000 men, and Wang Bingxiao's militia also has over 1,000 men. The bases of both sides are close to each other. Every day at 5:00 p.m., they deploy teams to patrol as if facing a major enemy, watching each other's movements. This has been going on for more than a day. Recently, a part of the security force attempted to seize the militia's weapons. At the same time, Feng Peng, an officer of the security force, was attacked by the militia at Yaming Bridge. As a result, the conflict reignited. Zhu Shiqin, a standing member of the War Zone Clearance Committee, went to mediate. Although the conflict between the two sides has temporarily stopped, they still confront each other. During this period, bandits in the county seized the opportunity to plunder, burning and killing everywhere, causing chaos throughout the county. Tangjiazhuang and other villages were burned and looted completely, devastating the area and causing significant losses. According to people from Yutian, the residents of the surrounding villages are now suffering from bandit disturbances, living in dire straits, while the residents within the area are startled several times a night. Only three or four shops are barely managing to stay open, while the rest have closed. The losses in the county this time are extremely heavy, and it will take at least three to five years to restore the area to its original state.</p>
<p>Seeing the devastation of the area, the authorities are seeking a solution and plan to use a radical approach: transferring the security force in the area to Qinhuangdao and sending a new security force to take over their defense. The militia will then be reorganized. Zhu Shile is coordinating with all parties. The security force has agreed to be transferred from Yutian, but has set the disbandment of the militia as a condition. The authorities are determined to handle this matter impartially and resolve it thoroughly to avoid future troubles. Zhu Shiqin traveled to Tianjin, Tangshan and other places to negotiate. He returned to Beiping via Tianjin the night before and went to visit Huang Fu at the Political Consolidation Committee yesterday morning for instructions. At 1:00 p.m., he went to Tianjin again to negotiate. The future is still difficult to predict. However, the authorities are quite determined this time and will not handle it as perfunctorily as they did last time, in order to fundamentally resolve the problem once and for all.

<p>New York: The transactions in the securities market this morning in the half hour after opening gave the impression that yesterday's surge would continue today. The market situation at the opening was quite active, with prices of various securities rising from fractions to one pound sterling. Industrial stocks remained popular, as positive commercial news led to good demand. Automobile stocks were bought. The talk of inflation circulating on Wall Street this morning seemed to be the reason for the rise in securities prices. Some quarters believe that the new Congress will certainly approve inflation, and the shortage of the budget, the needs of winter relief, and the necessity of borrowing are also being spread by word of mouth. Speculators, seeing this situation, are becoming more active. Hopes from all sides seem to be the same. Tax-avoidance selling seems to have disappeared. Speakers predict that the surge will continue to expand.</p>

<p>Negotiations on the war zone issue show promise; highway and air routes are still under discussion.</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Recent negotiations in Beijing among representatives from various parties regarding North China diplomacy are showing progress. The long-pending unresolved issues concerning the war zone have also been discussed several times by the responsible personnel of the War Zone Clearance Committee and Ii and Shibayama, etc., and there is some progress. The main points of the discussion are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of the security forces: The disputes between the two sides on this matter concern the number of personnel and weapons. The Japanese side previously insisted that the total number of personnel should not exceed 5,000, and that no weapons other than guns should be carried. The Chinese side insisted that the number of personnel should be 9,000, and that, in addition to rifles, light and heavy machine guns should be carried. As a result of the current negotiations, the Japanese side has made some concessions: the number of new security forces should not exceed 5,000 in addition to the original security forces in the war zone. Regarding weapons, heavy firearms cannot be carried, but there is still room for negotiation regarding light machine guns. The Japanese side also expressed its willingness to assist in matters such as cracking down on vagrant Japanese and preventing bandits from outside the Great Wall line from invading the war zone.</p>
<p>(2) The dispute over tax checkpoints at various passes of the Great Wall: The Japanese side believes that since both sides have set up checkpoints at various passes to collect taxes, a liaison method should be adopted to avoid disputes. The Chinese side is currently considering this matter. At the same time, tax officials from various passes are meeting in Beijing to discuss everything and submit the agreed-upon methods to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of taking over Malanyu: In principle, the Japanese side has always acknowledged the takeover, but there are several additional requirements. At the same time, the Japanese puppet troops in the area are using the excuse that the barracks outside the pass have not been completed to refuse to withdraw, which is why it has been difficult to achieve this to this day. Representatives from all parties in Beijing have also discussed this matter. Although the various issues have not been completely resolved, there seems to be some progress compared to before. Ii and Sakei, the chief of staff of the Japanese North China Garrison Headquarters, came to Beijing from Tianjin and had another round of discussions with various parties. Ii has already returned east, while Sakei is still in Beijing. In recent days, the frequent comings and goings of important Japanese figures, in addition to the war zone issue, the highway and air route issues are actually the center of the discussions. The Japanese side attaches great importance to this matter, and the Chinese negotiators are also taking a cautious approach. (26th)</p>

<p>Shanghai Police Bureau's Request to Extradite a Robber Denied</p>
<p>The case of the robbery of the Rihoto Silver Shop in the Japanese Concession early in the morning, and the shooting of the manager Zhao Houzhuang, has caused a stir in the city and countryside. Everyone believes that during the winter defense period, robberies occurring in broad daylight endanger the business of merchants. Fortunately, the Water Patrol Special Forces intercepted the robber Zhao Zhiyi on the same day, and he confessed to the crime without hesitation. A pistol was also found, which belonged to the Shanghai Municipal Police Team. It turns out that the robber Zhao's father, Zhao Fusheng, is currently employed as a detective in the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. He requested an extension of his leave to return to his hometown to bury his mother. His son Zhiyi came to Shanghai to continue his leave and was suggested by Qiu Liangkang to secretly steal his father's pistol and come to Songjiang to commit the robbery. Qiu, who committed the robbery with him, is now at large, and Zhao's father, Zhao Fusheng, has been placed under surveillance for the theft of the pistol. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to Songjiang to identify the pistol and extradite Zhao Zhiyi to Shanghai for interrogation, but the local county government refused the extradition request because the case was of great importance.</p>

<p>Female Silk Factory Workers Petition for Wages</p>
<p>The Xingji Silk Factory under the Iron Tree Bridge outside the South Gate recently suddenly closed down, and the manager, Ji Yunchu, avoided meeting with the workers. More than 3,000 yuan in wages are owed to the workers. After repeated visits to the factory by the female workers to demand payment, they dragged Ji Zenrong, the silk room director, and the car managers Li Dezai, Gu Zhongliang, Feng Chunchu, Qian Shoukui, and Feng Zhuliang into the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau one after another, but to no avail. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 28th), the female workers gathered again, numbering three to four hundred, each holding incense sticks, and dragging Ji Zenrong and Wang Jiepu with them, and marched in formation to the county government to petition. They were stopped by the gatekeepers. The female workers then went to the local branch court, but were also stopped. They then went to the Public Security Bureau, where Inspector Wang received them and interrogated Ji Zenrong. According to Ji, the factory only had 1,360 yuan, which was deposited in the Zhenyuan Silk Factory, and there was no other way. After Inspector Wang's mediation, the female workers' November wages were paid out at an 80% rate from the 1,360 yuan yesterday (the 29th). However, the female workers, because there was still no solution for the rest of the wages, will petition the county party headquarters again. The factory's car manager Qian Shoukui and others also dragged Ji Yunchu's wife Bei, who is the director of the factory's sorting room Xu Junyu, into the Second Branch yesterday and transferred her to the Third Branch to be handled together.</p>

<p>Murder for Profit Case in the Sixth District</p>
<p>Wang Quansheng, a farmer from Shihsiang Village in Bantang Township, about two li east of the Sixth District of Wuyi, was about twenty years old and unmarried. He lived alone, farming for a living, and had some savings in his hands. He suddenly disappeared on the fourth day of the old lunar month. It has been nearly twenty days since then, and there has been no news of him. The villagers found a bloodstain in Quansheng's bedroom, and rumors spread that Quansheng had been murdered. It was then discovered that Wang Jinshu and Zhou Heshang from the vicinity had gone to call at the door the night Quansheng disappeared, and Zhou Heshang's behavior was usually improper. Therefore, Quansheng's relatives reported to the Bantang Sixth District Office. The district chief Xie Jun arrested the two suspects, Zhou and Wang. It was also discovered that Wang Chunsheng was also highly suspected, and he was temporarily detained together. While District Chief Xie was investigating, Wang Quan's corpse was suddenly found in the river in Bantang Township. The villagers salvaged the body, and there were indeed serious injuries on his body. District Chief Xie reported the case to the county court on the 28th and requested that personnel be sent to examine the body. The court prosecutor, Guan Junjie, supervised officials and went to the countryside on the 29th to examine the body and brought the suspects to the case for interrogation and handling.</p>

An elderly couple surnamed Xia were beaten on the head by the bandits, and blood flowed profusely. After looting to their hearts' content, the bandits fled east. The townspeople chased after them, and the Shuang Gou Township Self-Defense Corps in the vicinity heard the alarm and fired many shots, capturing two bandits, Yue Da Ma, etc., on the spot, as well as two guns. This afternoon at 2 pm, they were escorted to the city along with two private salt boats and two bandits and sent to the county for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Security Team Soldiers Beat Car Owner</p>
<p>The Donghai long-distance bus, which runs between Haimen and Qidong, came to Haimen from Qidong the day before yesterday and was passing through Fuan Township in the Sixth District. Several soldiers from the Second Company of the Security Team stationed there wanted to take the bus to Haimen. At that time, the bus was crowded with passengers and there was no space. The car owner Shen Zhiting politely refused. Unexpectedly, the soldiers, without asking the reason, dragged Shen off the bus and beat him at will, then dragged him to the team headquarters, tied him with hemp rope, and forced him to sign a statement of apology. Later, District Chief Bao Zhan of the Sixth District went to bail him out, but Shen suffered serious injuries to his chest and waist. He groaned in bed after returning home, and medicine was ineffective, and his life was in danger. Yesterday, Shen's family specially petitioned the county government to investigate and handle the case according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wu Tiecheng said in his speech: The China Aviation Association was established in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). At that time, the Shanghai Aviation Saves the Nation Movement was launched, and donations were solicited with the goal of 2 million yuan to purchase aircraft and present them to the government to consolidate national defense. From the beginning to the end of last year, although the total amount obtained was only more than 1.3 million yuan, and the actual paid amount was only more than 1.1 million yuan, which was about two-thirds of the target amount, it was no easy task for Shanghai, which had not recovered its vitality after the January 28th Incident, coupled with the impact of the world economic panic. The reasons were: (1) The citizens of Shanghai, because of the lessons of the January 28th Incident, deeply understood the importance of national defense, especially the power of the air force, so they were enthusiastic about making contributions; (2) The enthusiasm and perseverance of the team leaders and members engaged in solicitation enabled them to achieve this result. Today's award ceremony has the honor of having representatives from the central government to guide us, and the Government has awarded medals, which is an honor for Shanghai and an honor for the citizens of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Solicitation Process <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Next, Wang Xiaolai, the representative of the Aviation Association, reported on the solicitation process, saying: The China Aviation Association was established on New Year's Day in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). After a resolution by the third executive council, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of this city, was elected as the general captain of the Shanghai solicitation team. At the same time, an office was set up at the YMCA in Baxianqiao, and leaders from all walks of life in the city were invited to serve as team leaders, totaling 227 teams. It was stipulated that each team should solicit 10,000 yuan, with 2 million yuan as the minimum. It was also stipulated that each soliciting team should report on their results six times, once every ten days, temporarily limited to two months. As of April 3rd, a total of five reports have been submitted. The first time, a total of 266,268 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen; the second time, a total of 292,842 yuan and 9 jiao and 8 fen; the third time, a total of 235,231 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen; the fourth time, a total of 88,645 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 li; the fifth time, a total of 130,918 yuan, 9 jiao, and 8 fen and 6 li. The total amount of the above five items is 1,008,807 yuan, 1 fen, and 1 li, which is only half of the original amount. The deadline was extended by one month. The sixth time, a total of 386,063 yuan and 9 jiao. The combined calculation shows that there are 1,394,870 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 fen, and 1 li. However, most of this amount is a virtual recognition, and the actual payment of cash is still very small. Therefore, although the work of soliciting members was declared over at the end of May, the office continued to urge the payment of funds and collect special donations from individuals and groups. As of the end of May, the total amount of funds paid by each team and special donations from individuals and groups was 952,363 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen, which has been fully transferred to the custody committee by the office. The situation of contacting various group donations is briefly described below. The Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, at the second performance report meeting of the office, sent representative Wang Jinwen to report that it had recognized the solicitation of 100,000 yuan for the Aviation Saves the Nation Fund. The conference heard the news and praised it. Thus, the 100,000 yuan fund for the Fresh Meat Industry Aircraft was finalized. Later, some misunderstandings occurred in a portion. After dispatching staff to explain, the representatives of the industry, Rong Fuchang, Gu Qiusheng, Ma Jingkun, etc., discussed the solution and obtained the undertaking of the sales industry. However, there were still objections from the pig industry. Later, the sales industry association proceeded independently, collecting two cents for each pig. After detailed consultations, the four township representatives of the fresh meat industry were convened on September 20 last year to discuss and decide that the 100,000 yuan Aviation Saves the Nation Fund of the fresh meat industry would allocate two-thirds of the funds for slaughter improvement to be used as the Aviation Saves the Nation Fund, with the goal of collecting 100,000 yuan. After the deadline, it will be returned to the association for handling. Thus, the long-pending 100,000 yuan Aviation Saves the Nation Fund of the fresh meat industry was settled and handed over to the Finance Bureau for collection, and two installments have been paid, totaling more than 10,000 yuan. The travel industry sent a letter at this time to solicit 200,000 yuan for the Aviation Saves the Nation Fund. At the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on June 21, it was passed to handle the matter according to the method proposed by the office, but the office was requested to report to the municipal government and instruct the travel industries that have not joined the association to join the association. The office immediately sent a special letter to the municipal government for review and handling. Because travel industries that have not joined the association, although consulted, did not get a practical solution, it was delayed. Zhang Yuliang and the association have repeatedly consulted and decided that the General Captain Wu Tiecheng and the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai will specially invite the travel industry colleagues at the Bankers Association Club and discuss the collection of aviation saving donation matters. During the meeting, it was decided that the travel industry association will properly draft the methods and report to the office, which will be forwarded to the municipal government to notify the travel industry that joined the association, and then convene a plenary meeting to determine the collection date. However, since most of the travel industry is located in the public concession and the French concession, before the collection, please the municipal government contact the authorities of the two concessions. On March 13, the travel industry association was convened again to talk and decided to convene the city travel industry representative conference on April 9 to decide unanimously to collect, and determined that the collection will start on April 15, and the method is basically still as originally agreed. Unexpectedly, the concession authorities stopped it a few days after the implementation, which led to interruption. Later, the municipal government contacted the concession authorities again and sent staff to the industry to persuade and enlighten them, and finally got the sympathy of most of the travel industry and the association. The office notified the city's travel industry to continue to collect unanimously on July 28 and appointed a number of inspectors to urge and persuade the travel industry. At the same time, the travel industry association colleagues deeply believe that aviation saves the nation and is an urgent task for saving the country and survival, so they collected opinions from all parties and recruited those who are reputable and have status in the travel industry to organize a fundraising committee to respond to the office. From then on, the travel industry aviation donation gradually increased in scale and became more solid. The travel industry aircraft fund is based on this. The Nanyang Tobacco Company recognized the solicitation of 100,000 yuan for the Aviation Saves the Nation Fund at the third performance report meeting of the office on April 5 last year. Later, it was stated that this money is specifically for the training of aviation pilots. Before this matter is held, the payment will be delayed. After repeated consultations with the company, it was finally agreed to reduce the donation by 50,000 yuan. It was immediately sent to the China Aviation Association to change the original amount, and it was also approved. The company then paid the 50,000 yuan donation to the office, which was immediately transferred to the China Aviation Association Custody Committee. Other aviation saving donations such as shipping and mining are in progress.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Representatives' Speeches <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Next, Chu Minyi, the representative of the National Government, said: I am very honored to participate in today's grand ceremony. Shanghai has achieved this result in an economic downturn, which shows that citizens have recognized the importance of national defense, and building the army and navy is time-consuming and costly, and the effectiveness of the air force is not as great, and the money and time required for construction are less. My country's national defense has always been very empty. Now, with the advocacy of the government and the efforts of the people, we can get good results. Shanghai has already achieved success, and I hope to promote it. My country has a population of 450 million, and if we are united, the development of the air force will be fast and huge, which can be predicted. Next, Lu Xirong, the representative of the Central Government, said: The efforts of the China Aviation Association to save the country through aviation are of great significance to national defense and national survival. In terms of national defense, the center of the past world war was in Europe, and the most recent future war will be in Asia. Modern countries civilization are built on the positions of aircrafts and artillery. Powerful countries invade people, while weak countries are invaded by people. Under this situation, for the sake of their own survival, they have to be prepared. Under the advocacy of Mayor Wu in Shanghai, huge sums of money were collected in a short period of time, which is very admirable. In terms of national survival, our country has been repeatedly invaded by foreigners since the Opium War, and the nation has been greatly stimulated, especially the stimulation of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, so they all feel the need for air defense. The donations of the association are great in material and even greater in spirit. It is a symbol of national awakening, the general motivation for national rejuvenation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Aviation Association's Reply <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Wang Xiaolai, the director of the China Aviation Association, said on behalf of the association: The association has been established for two years, and I am ashamed that it has not achieved any results. At today's grand ceremony, on behalf of the association, I would like to express my gratitude to the citizens and various groups for their active participation, and I also express my gratitude to the government for its encouragement and award of medals. As for the advocacy of Mayor Wu, and the results that have been obtained, I would also like to express my deep respect, and I have specially prepared a stone ball to express my gratitude. Although the association has achieved considerable results in the city in the past two years, it has not been able to promote it to the whole country, which is quite ashamed. The meaning of saving the country through aviation has been expressed a lot, so there is no need to repeat it. Now another year has passed, and the 24th year will be here soon. The association will fulfill its responsibility of saving the country through aviation. I hope that the people of the whole country will also recognize the four characters of "saving the country through aviation". After the award ceremony, Wang, on behalf of the association, presented the stone ball to Mayor Wu for remembrance.</p>

As for the rate for adding water to the head of the exchange (speculation), the highest yesterday was 0.65% and the lowest was 0.40%.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Bank Preparation Committee Issues Certificates <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>In order to regulate finance, the United Bank Preparation Committee will issue certificates after evaluating the prepared assets pledged by various banks. Originally, there were three types: public treasury certificates, mortgage certificates, and public certificates. Now they have been changed to two types: public treasury certificates and public certificates, with 50% for public treasury certificates and 50% for public certificates. (1) Public treasury funds can be used as guarantee reserves for issuing banknotes by banks and for savings deposits in various banks, and can be borrowed from committee banks at full value. (2) Public certificates are issued by the user bank and circulate in the market, replacing cash. Their nature is the same as circulating securities.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Public Certificates Fully Circulate in the Market <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The committee is also raising a loan fund to make loans. If a committee bank lacks cash, it can borrow at full value using public certificates. The location is at the committee's office. The loan period is one month, and interest is calculated daily, determined by the standing committee at any time, and announced daily as the bank preparation committee loan interest rate. The committee banks are responsible for paying the bill immediately upon sight of the public certificates. After paying, they will wait to recover the cash from the user bank. Yesterday's public certificate loan interest rate was 1.08%, that is, 0.28% daily interest on every 1,000 yuan.</p>

The preparation vault issues custody receipts. The vault can also handle deposit and loan matters for the same industry. Therefore, member money shops can borrow cash from the vault, but only with the approval of the vault's executive committee.</p>

<p>In the capital and Shanghai, guarantees are provided by chambers of commerce, etc.</p>
<p>In other places, the customs superintendent will verify and issue the documents</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the customs superintendents' offices, the chambers of commerce of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the banking and money industry associations, stating: "It has been practiced for many years that a passport must be obtained from this ministry for transporting cash. Recently, in order to prevent the smuggling of cash out of the country, all customs offices have been instructed to verify and release goods based on the passport, and no private transportation is allowed without a passport. However, the silver standard currency should still be freely circulated domestically. Now, at the time of the entry of local products into the market, transportation to and from should be facilitated. The regulations for obtaining a passport are as follows: 1. When banking and money industry firms and ordinary businesses in the capital and Shanghai regions apply for a passport for transporting cash, they should still apply to this ministry, but banks must attach a guarantee from the banking association, money shops must attach a guarantee from the money industry association, and businesses must attach a guarantee from the municipal chamber of commerce. Foreign banks should have the Central Bank forward the application for verification and issuance. 2. In other places outside the capital and Shanghai regions, the customs superintendent is allowed to pre-receive blank cash transportation passports from the ministry for immediate verification and issuance, specifying the destination and quantity to be transported, and report to the ministry for verification. After the original passport is used up, it should be submitted to the ministry for verification and cancellation. All passport fees and stamp duties on the passport should still be handled according to regulations. 3. When banking and money industry firms and ordinary businesses apply for a cash transportation passport from the nearby customs superintendent, they must have a guarantee from the local chamber of commerce or banking and money industry association. The customs superintendent should verify and issue the passport if it is clear. If there is collusion and this passport is used to smuggle goods out of the country, once verified, the superintendent will be removed and punished, and the passport-receiving firms and guaranteeing agencies will be punished according to the regulations for smuggling goods out of the country. 4. If the amount of silver coins transported in places without customs is more than 1,000 yuan, a certificate should be issued by the local chamber of commerce or banking and money industry association to be presented to the customs checkpoints and military police along the way for inspection. 5. All guarantees should guarantee that the transportation is for legitimate domestic business purposes and that there is no smuggling of goods out of the country. Otherwise, joint and several liability will be borne. The certificate should certify the transportation quantity, location, and actual purpose, and that there is no smuggling of goods out of the country. Otherwise, joint and several liability will be borne. The above five items are a flexible modification of the current regulations to ensure that laws, regulations, business conditions, and all aspects are taken into account. It will be implemented on a trial basis from today. In addition to separate consultations, this order is hereby issued to the association to forward it to all businesses for compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e156">Jiande Bank Shareholders' Meeting Resolved to Liquidate Yesterday <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>And Ordered the Board of Directors to Report on the Past Years</p>
<p>Jiande Bank on North Henan Road in this port, due to financial difficulties, announced a temporary suspension of business for five days on the 8th of this month to convene a board of directors to discuss a resumption plan. Although the general manager contacted related parties to add capital, it did not materialize due to various reasons. Subsequently, the board of directors convened a shareholders' meeting, which then decided to resume business or liquidate. At 2:00 PM yesterday, a shareholders' meeting was convened at the Lixin Accountants' Office at No. 190 Ningbo Road. More than 50 shareholders, including Zhou Weinan, Liu Yaoji, and Hunji, attended. Wang Chengdian was elected as the temporary chairman. On behalf of the board of directors, accountant Pan Xulun and lawyer Qu Yue attended to report that business had been poor recently and financial turnover was not smooth, so they had no choice but to temporarily suspend business. They asked the shareholders to decide whether to resume business or liquidate. After a thorough discussion among the shareholders present, it was decided to officially declare the suspension of business and liquidate. Liu Yaoting, Zhou Weinan, Sun Lianfang, Wang Chengdian, and Wang Jinqing were elected on the spot as representatives to assist accountant Pan in organizing internal affairs and liquidation matters. However, no directors attended the meeting, and the shareholders raised questions and criticized them. How were the income and expenditure accounts, and was the share capital fully paid up? All of this had to be proven by the directors. Therefore, it has been decided that the shareholders' meeting will notify the board of directors to convene a meeting and request the board of directors to report on the past years. If they refuse to attend again at that time, legal procedures will be taken to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The first relief team of the Red Swastika Society, led by the society's supervisors Zhou Zongliang, Han Shichang, Li Dixian, and Zheng Yingzhi, departed earlier. The second team departed on the 17th. Now, we have learned from the Shanghai General Office of the society that the advance team has reported that they have arrived in Xunyang one after another. We now record the team's report below: (omitted above) Our team departed on the Jiangxin steamer on the morning of the 17th. At each port we passed, our society sent teams to welcome us at the dock. On the 19th, we arrived in Xunyang. The Jiangxi Provincial Government sent the director of the Municipal Committee, Li Zhongxiang, along with police and local officials, to welcome us at the ship and provide sincere hospitality. We contacted various circles here, such as the Martial Law Commander Chen Lei, County Magistrate Bao Gongren, Police Chief Pan Baijian, the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and the president of the Central Bank of China, and the discussions were extremely satisfactory. We stayed at the Xunyang Preparatory Office for three days. Then, we received a telegram from Chairman Xiong, stating that the people in the disaster area were in urgent need of relief and requesting that we come to the province immediately to implement relief efforts. He also telegraphed the Nanxun Railway Bureau to provide a special train to welcome our team to the province. On the 22nd, we arrived in Nanchang. The Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Relief Committee, the Central and China Banks, and the Ningbo Compatriots Association all welcomed us at the station with firecrackers. They also prepared cars and motorboats to cross the river. Team members, doctors, nurses, and servants were housed in the Nanchang Hotel prepared by the provincial government. Zongliang and others stayed at the Qianhe Paint Store in Daizi Lane. According to reporters, the disaster area in Jiangxi currently needs cotton clothing, but rice, salt, and medicine are even more urgent. The 8,000 sets of cotton clothing prepared by our society are not enough, and we hope to quickly make another 2,000 sets. More than 2,000 shi of foreign rice are not enough, and we still need to continue purchasing and transporting it to Jiangxi. The arrangement of medical care and burial is in progress. For salt, Chairman Jiang's headquarters has approved ten passports, which can be used to purchase and transport 100 dan, with each dan costing slightly more than 12 yuan. Chairman Xiong has telegraphed the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Finance to handle matters such as tax and fee exemptions for relief supplies. Zongliang also plans to go to the disaster area to investigate in the coming days, and further details will be reported later. Furthermore, the society received a telegram from the Jiujiang Office yesterday, stating that the second relief team has arrived in Xunyang and is in the process of transporting relief supplies to the disaster area.</p>

<p>Crossing the Pacific to Shanghai, Telegram Received Notifying Arrival on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Dutch-owned Java Shipping Company has a significant presence in the Far East shipping industry, with its Java-Shanghai line in the South Seas Islands and its European routes between China and the Netherlands. The South Seas line is exclusively operated by this company. Since China increased import tariffs on sugar, the Java shipping line has been significantly affected in its import business. Now, the head of the company, Mr. Riisegaarve Bssicdop, and the company's Far East General Manager, Sir Jdr. C.F.J. Quarles Van Ufforu, are visiting countries all over the world to investigate commercial, economic, and shipping conditions in order to prepare for reorganization and expansion of the Far East shipping business. Mr. Riisegaarve and Sir Quarles first crossed the Atlantic to America, then via San Francisco and across the Pacific to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received a telegram that the two gentlemen were coming to Shanghai on the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan and would arrive on New Year's Day. At that time, all staff of the office will need to go to the customs wharf to welcome them.

<p>Hu Yongqi, Standing Committee member of the Insurance Industry Association, General Manager of Ning Shao Life Insurance Company, and Trustee of Shanghai University, believes that the various types of insurance issued by Chinese insurance companies are purely domestic products. Next year is Student National Products Year, and preparations for publicity campaigns are underway. In order to promote the understanding of Chinese people of insuring with Chinese companies, and for the sake of purchasing domestic goods, Mr. Hu sent a letter to the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association, applying to participate in this publicity campaign. The original letter is recorded below: "Respected Sirs, I have recently read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Education Bureau has proposed next year as Student National Products Year and will soon jointly hold publicity campaigns and exhibitions with domestic manufacturers in the city to stimulate the concept of compatriots loving domestic goods, in order to save the tide of rights and interests flowing abroad. I, Yongqi, am not talented, but I think that Chinese insurance, with purely Chinese capital, provides the same protection and services as foreigners, and is truly an excellent domestic product. Moreover, there are many benefits to insuring with Chinese companies. We should participate in this grand event so that people can recognize that insuring with Chinese companies is equivalent to using domestic goods, and the collected insurance premiums can be used in the cause of domestic goods, which is a more special contribution than directly purchasing domestic goods. Now, in the midst of the voice of national salvation, this is an essential plan. I have always admired your association as the leader of our industry, so I have specially sent this letter to inform you. Is this appropriate? I respectfully request that you propose its implementation."</p>

<h3 id="e164">Tianjin East Asia Woolen Textile Company to Implement New Expansion Plan Next Year <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Dii Yang Brand and High-Angle Gun Brand of domestic woolen yarn produced by the Tianjin East Asia Woolen Textile Company have been well-received by patriotic ladies since they went on sale. They are inexpensive and of high quality, with many special features. Therefore, this year's sales have broken the highest previous record and are a major rival to imported woolen yarn. Yesterday, I met with Mr. Zhao Zizhen, Deputy Manager of the General Company, at the company's Shanghai office at 117 Edward Road, and he spoke in great detail about the company's new expansion plan for next year. I am recording it here to inform friends who care about domestic goods. According to the current situation, East Asia Company only produces one type of woolen yarn, wool thread. Other products, such as woolen fabrics, wool yarn, and all kinds of scientific woolen products, are planned to be gradually expanded and realized from next year. As for the woolen yarn this year, the business situation is very good compared to previous years. It has been verified that the country is divided into four regions. The North China region has sold 400,000 to 500,000 pounds, the East China region has also sold 200,000 to 300,000 pounds, the Central China region has sold more than 200,000 pounds, and the South China region has also sold more than 300,000 pounds. Next year, we plan to take further steps and fight to the death with imported goods, determined to achieve final victory. It is expected that next year's results will be even better than this year. In addition, the Tianjin factory has added five of the latest large combing machines, which can comb as much as 5,000 pounds of wool per day. They have now been manufactured and are ready, and the test results are excellent. Furthermore, Mr. Song Xiafei, the factory director and chief engineer of the company, was sent to Europe and America on November 15th by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government to inspect the woolen weaving industry. It is expected that he will make great contributions when he returns to China to develop the industry. At present, I (i.e., Zhao himself) and Mr. Song Yaoqing, the general manager of the company, have decided to work hard to promote domestic goods and aim to achieve the National Government's conscience-based national salvation goals. We will not give up until we achieve this goal.</p>

<p>Attached Civil Suit in the Case of Yang Jianping and Liu Shufan Also Judged Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e168">Zhao Baoshan Should Compensate More Than 139,800 Yuan <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The former and current directors of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, Yang Jianping and Liu Shufan, wanted to transfer the savings of depositors to be used as capital for the bureau to engage in real estate. Zhao Baoshan, the brother of Zhao Minzhi, manager of the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Branch, was a land broker in Shanghai. Yang had a brother-in-law relationship with Zhao, so he told him about the land purchase, allowing Zhao to profit from the opportunity to sell real estate. In the autumn of the previous year, the bureau purchased two batches of land through Zhao Baoshan, who colluded with Yang Jianping to inflate the land prices and illegally profited more than 130,000 yuan, which they shared. Later, Yang and Zhao were relieved of their duties as branch managers. Ren Sijian replaced them, and he also擅自挪用储金,代逊记经营公债,使该分局受利息之损失，使 the branch suffered interest losses by擅自挪用储金,代逊记经营公债，营私舞弊，致國庫大受損失. This summer, the case was discovered, and the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office investigated and prosecuted it according to law. After the first instance judgment, the defendants and the prosecutor both expressed dissatisfaction and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The prosecutor filed an incidental civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation, because the actions of these private and fraudulent people had caused great losses to the national treasury. The Second Branch of the High Court announced its judgment on the criminal part a few days ago. Zhao Baoshan, as a public official, indirectly sought benefits for matters under his jurisdiction and was sentenced to two years of imprisonment and fined 3,000 yuan. Ren Sida's appeal was rejected, and he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment as in the first instance. The prosecutor's appeal on the criminal matter was also rejected. As for the incidental civil suit filed by the prosecutor, after presiding Judge Yu, along with Assessors Zhao Zhengtang and Zhou Han, concluded their deliberations, they determined that the losses suffered by the Savings and Remittance Bureau should be compensated by Zhao Baoshan and Ren Sida. Yesterday afternoon, presiding Judge Yu still held a hearing with Assessors Zhao and Zhou to announce the judgment. The main text of the judgment was: Ren Sida should compensate the plaintiff 186.059 yuan and interest calculated at 5% per annum from December 3, 1931 until the date of execution. Zhao Baoshan should compensate the plaintiff 139,860.14 yuan and interest calculated at 5% per annum from July 14, 1932 until the date of execution. The plaintiff's other claims were dismissed.</p>

<p>Due to Insults to Railway Employees, Causing Indignation Among Employees of Both Railways</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency: The Consolidation Office of the Two Railway Unions has submitted reports to the Party Departments and Administrations of the Two Railways, stating that the Shanghai Machine Factory and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Section of the Shanghai Railway Branch have reported that the "Flying Flower Village" movie by Yihua Film Company is indecent, fabricates facts, and deliberately insults railway employees. All employees are extremely indignant and request that the company be stopped from showing the movie. The matter was immediately investigated, and it is now reported that, according to investigations, the film does contain the insult and damage to the reputation of the railway and the insult of the employees of the two roads. This is verified by the following factors：（一）站長與司機合夥公然販運毒品、（四大箱三大包）（二）是項毒品、公然運入貨色車、（三）站長室公然受賄、（四）站長用種種方式、誘姦生火之妻、（五）站長於逃亡後、公然殺人、（六）全部以徐家滙站及上海機廠爲背景、（七）有本路機車三只、爲C十五·十六兩號·餘一只不明、（八）有滬杭甬綫三四等車廂、（九）站長之帽章與本路警務署之飛輸帽章相同、（十）顚倒鐵路組織、爲外人所恥. Based on this, it has been verified that the content of the film is illegal and criminal, and it includes the machine factory station engine and carriages and cap badges of the railway. There is an unmistakable insult and damage to the reputation of the railway and the insult of the employees of the two roads. The evidence is obvious and cannot be covered up. In addition, the telegram from the Shanghai Machine Factory Branch has also been submitted, and a copy of the original telegram is on file. Now, all employees of the two railways are filled with indignation, and public opinion is激昂. This office believes that the matter is of great importance and should be submitted to your associations (bureaus) for urgent disposition, and a telegram should be sent to the central government for strict prohibition in order to maintain the reputation of the railway and quell public sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="e171">High Skill, Accumulation of Theft, Able to Climb Walls and Turn Over Houses <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Value of the Stolen Goods Reaches Over 10,000 Yuan, Finally Apprehended at Kunshan Railway Station After Repeated Investigation, The Circumstances are Complex and the Investigation Takes Time, Re-examine After Extension ｜</p>
<p>The habitual thief, Wang Zhaorong, also known as Wang Tianling, is 23 years old and from Huzhou. He makes a living by performing solo plays. When business is slow, he uses theft as his side business, specializing in stealing property from wealthy Chinese and Western households in the British and French Concessions. He has committed dozens of cases, and the value of the stolen goods reaches over 10,000 yuan. In the last month, two major cases occurred in the French Concession. After the victims reported to the police, Detective Liu Jinrong was sent to investigate. The thief's skills are extremely high. He can climb walls and turn over houses without leaving any traces outside. After the detective carefully studied the thief's whereabouts, he obtained fingerprints and footprints in the house, took photos, and compared them at the police station. It was confirmed to be Wang's fingerprints. Wang was punished for committing a crime in the British Concession five years ago. A cloth bag and a chisel were found in the victim's house, which were left by Wang. There was a piece of paper in the bag, on which was written Zhang Huiqing, No. 16 Xingye Li, Huayi Street. The detectives then began to investigate and arrest Wang. They inquired with Zhang about Wang's address. According to him, Wang was staying at the Dahua Hotel in Yuqing Li, Xixin Bridge Street, and gave a communication address when he met, but did not know the exact location of his home. The detectives then investigated at the Dahua Hotel. According to the bellboy, Wang often came to open a room and stay, and had many friends. The detectives waited at the hotel for three days and nights. The day before, Wu Gensheng came to the Dahua Hotel to visit Wang. The detectives asked Wu about Wang's address. Wu said that he believed Wang lived at No. 17, Huangjia Road, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. The detectives immediately coordinated with the local Public Security Bureau to send detectives to arrest him at the address. However, only Wang's old mother was at home. When asked, she replied that her son, Wang Zhaorong, had gone to Kunshan Jiaozhi Town to perform. The detectives reported to the police chief and requested the Second Special Court to prepare a document. The detectives, accompanied by Wu Gensheng, took a car to the Kunshan County Government and requested assistance in the arrest. The county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to send detectives to Jiaozhi to arrest Wang. Unexpectedly, Wang's mother had already gone to Kunshan with a real letter to her son, instructing him to escape immediately. The detectives had already arrived and hired a motorboat to chase after him. They finally arrested Wang at the Kunshan Railway Station, took him to the county government for questioning, and then transferred him to Shanghai, where he was taken to the French Police Station. Under questioning, Wang confessed that he had sold the stolen goods to Cai Haizhong at No. 80 Zhaojiawan in the Chinese area. The detectives then arrested Cai and detained him. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated him. Attorney Yuan Jiahong of the police station stated the case, saying that the defendant had committed many crimes, and the circumstances were complicated and the investigation would take time, requesting that the hearing be postponed for two weeks so that a detailed investigation could be carried out before prosecuting. Then, Detective Liu Jinrong reported on the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant. Wang Zhaorong confessed that he had committed continuous theft in more than 20 households, but on July 24, he was arrested by the Public Security Bureau, sent to the court for interrogation, and released after one month. All the stolen goods were confiscated by the Public Security Bureau. After I was released, I committed two more crimes in the French Concession. Cai Haizhong admitted to receiving the stolen goods. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered that the matter be re-examined on January 11, 1935, after the circumstances have been clarified. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Yongan Bank Director Accused of Fraudulent Acquisition of Property <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Owes Delong Tobacco Company Over 50,000 Yuan  Court Approves Warrant for the Arrest of Deng Jinghuan</p>
<p>Yongan Bank was established in a newly built massive building north of North Sichuan Road, with a claimed capital of one million yuan. Deng Jinghuan was appointed as Chairman, Ou Jiancheng as General Manager, and Ye Hancheng, Qian Youju, etc., as Directors. It began operations in September of this year, but its actual paid-up capital was only over 200,000 yuan despite the claimed million. Due to rapid expansion and numerous business lines, it suddenly announced liquidation in the newspaper on the 12th of this month due to temporary financial difficulties. Initially, it tried to resume operations, but ultimately went bankrupt due to various problems, severely impacting depositors and business partners. Delong Tobacco Company, located at the intersection of North Henan Road and Laobazi Road, is also one of the creditors, having had a deposit of 50,875 yuan wiped out by the bank's collapse. Considering that the bank went bankrupt in less than three months after opening, indicating fraudulent behavior, Wang Weiguan, the manager of Delong Tobacco Company, hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Deng Jinghuan, Chairman of Yongan Bank, and Directors Ye Hancheng and Qian Youju, of fraudulent acquisition of property, along with an attached civil suit. The main points of the lawsuit stated that the defendants were the Chairman and Directors of Yongan Bank, which opened on September 8th of this year with a capital of two million yuan. The plaintiff was one of the victims, having deposited 50,875 yuan in cash, not including other ongoing deposits. They held a promissory note from the bank, dated the 11th of this month. The bank went bankrupt only three months after opening. Subsequently, the two defendants, Ye and Qian, came to negotiate, requesting a two-day extension for payment, claiming that only over 200,000 yuan of capital had been received. Recently, they saw an advertisement by lawyers representing Deng Jinghuan, attempting to blame the fleeing General Manager Ou Jiancheng alone, without any solution for the fraudulently obtained deposits, constituting the crime of fraudulent acquisition of property under Article 363 of the Criminal Code, and attached a civil suit, requesting compensation of 50,875 yuan, etc. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard by Judge Huang Risheng at the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendants did not appear. The two defendants, Ye and Qian, had lawyers appear in court to state that Ye and Qian had gone to Pingjin and would return to Shanghai soon, requesting a postponement. Subsequently, the plaintiff Wang Weiguan submitted a petition explaining everything. Judge Huang ordered that the case be rescheduled for another hearing on January 7th at 2 PM, and a warrant for the arrest of Deng Jinghuan was approved.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Qian Shaoxun Still Suspected of Reactionary Activities After Surrender <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>No Evidence of Criminal Activity Found Permission Granted for Bail Pending Further Inquiry</p>
<p>Qian Shaoxun, a 29-year-old from Liyang and a staff member of the Shanghai Fish Market Preparatory Committee of the Ministry of Industry, located at 33 Sichuan Road, resided in the attic of No. 14 Renhua Lane, Saposai Road, in the French Concession. In September of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, based on a report from informant Yu Shuhong, alleged that Qian had previously been a reactionary and was still involved in reactionary activities after his surrender. The Provincial Government then sent a document to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, which forwarded it to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, instructing the French Concession police to arrest Qian at his residence on the afternoon of the 14th of the same month and transfer him to the Third Branch of the Higher Court for interrogation and detention pending evidence from the Jiangsu Provincial Government and witnesses for cross-examination. However, the Provincial Government has not provided any evidence for a long time. The Fish Market Preparatory Committee submitted a petition requesting Qian Shaoxun's release on bail pending further instructions. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Guo Dechang, along with the judges and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, opened the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. Qian Shaoxun stated that he worked at the Fish Market Preparatory Committee and had not participated in any reactionary activities, claiming he was falsely accused and had been detained for three or four months, requesting justice. Prosecutor Zhang stood up and stated that, to protect human rights, the defendant could not be detained solely based on verbal reports and requested the Presiding Judge to review the case. Judge Guo then consulted the Concession police lawyer, who stated that the Concession police had not found any evidence of the defendant's crime and requested the court to review the case. Judge Guo then ruled that the defendant Qian Shaoxun could be released on bail by a representative of the Fish Market Preparatory Committee, pending further review.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Death After Release From Police Station Overnight <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Station Chief and Police Officer Accused</p>
<p>Zhu Chuangqiu (aka Zhu Jianqiu), a 39-year-old from Changsha, Hunan, who owned the Family Food Store on Zhenru Taopu West Road, was detained by the local police station's household registration department for discrepancies in the reported population of the store. The store's apprentice, Gu Fulang, was detained overnight. The next day, Zhu went to the station to negotiate a replacement and was fined one yuan, after which Zhu was released on bail. Unexpectedly, Zhu became unconscious and had injuries upon leaving the police station. He was immediately sent to the Southeast Medical College for treatment, but died. The local court sent personnel for an investigation. As a precaution, the body was sent to the forensic institute for an autopsy. Zhu Shiying, the deceased's brother, felt aggrieved by his brother's sudden and tragic death and hired lawyer Yan Hongxi to file a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Zhou Pingyuan, the Chief of the Zhenru Police Station, Zhang Zhizhong, the household registration police officer, Qi Futing, the police chief of the police station, and a police officer surnamed Ma, of intentional homicide and requesting a thorough investigation. The court ordered the case to be held pending review.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Revisions to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Traffic Regulations <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Flexible Measures for Hankou Road One-Way Traffic</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to facilitate traffic within the Settlement, has revised several articles of the traffic regulations as recommended by the Traffic Committee, as follows: (1) Regarding one-way traffic on Hankou Road, except on Sundays and holidays, vehicles must travel east from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM daily. Vehicles must travel west from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM daily. However, chartered cars and rickshaws are not restricted. This article is on a trial basis. (2) Prohibited right turns: Except on Sundays and holidays, at the intersection of Nanjing Road, Xizang Road, and Jing'an Temple Road, from 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM, 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM, 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM, and 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM daily, vehicles are not allowed to turn right from Xizang Road onto Nanjing Road or Jing'an Temple Road. (3) Prohibited parking locations: A. The south side of Jing'an Temple Road, along the racetrack section, is prohibited from parking between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM and between 4:30 PM and 6:00 PM daily. B. The west side of Henan Road, between Third and Fourth Roads, is prohibited from parking between 12:00 PM and 12:30 PM and between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM and between 4:30 PM and 5:30 PM daily. C. The east side of Jiangxi Road, between Third and Fourth Roads, is prohibited from parking from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily. The above restrictions do not apply on Sundays and holidays. (4) Regarding cargo trucks, starting from January 1, 1936, cargo trucks are only allowed to have the driver and one other person in the front. The driver's seat must be properly separated. Previously, the Silk Industry Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and other groups and individuals requested the abolition of the one-way traffic on Hankou Road, claiming it hindered business. The Traffic Committee discussed it several times. However, according to investigations, although some shops on that road have closed down in recent years, it cannot be definitively concluded that it was due to the one-way traffic. Considering the commercial decline of various roads in the central district, Jiujiang Road may be even worse than Hankou Road. The reasons for relocation are mostly due to newly built houses with better sanitary facilities, leading people to abandon the old for the new. During the Traffic Committee's discussions, one member said that one-way traffic definitely discouraged customers from approaching and that protests should not be ignored. Another member said that the commerce on Hankou Road relied heavily on rickshaw passengers, so rickshaws could be allowed to travel in both directions at any time without restrictions. Another member said that the frequent changes in traffic direction were the greatest inconvenience, and if all roads were restricted to one-way traffic throughout the day, the benefits to businesses could be more evenly distributed. After deliberation, it was generally agreed that allowing rickshaws without restrictions would provide sufficient remedy, and it was decided to implement this on a trial basis. One member suggested that cargo trucks should have boards on both sides to prevent goods from falling, and the front seat should be limited to only the driver. After discussion, it was decided that one other person could be allowed in the front seat, and the Public Works Department would investigate and research whether side boards should be required before making a recommendation. The Police Chief reported that the department planned to test a set of electric automatic traffic control devices on Gordon Road and Edinburgh Road. These devices would cause vehicles to trigger an electric current when approaching an intersection, which would then activate the traffic lights. They have been effective in the United States and the United Kingdom, but each set would cost 10,000 yuan to install. There are currently 68 locations with traffic lights, which would be too expensive. After discussion, it was decided to postpone the plan and request the Police Chief to conduct further investigations during his trip to Europe.</p>

<p>An electric stove is lighter and easier to move compared to a coal stove or radiator, and it heats up instantly with the flip of a switch, without the need to add coal or remove ashes. It is clean and convenient, which are its advantages. However, the heat from an electric stove is limited to one corner of the room, unlike the widespread and even heat of a coal stove or radiator, which is its shortcoming. Ya Guang Manufacturing Company in this city, known for manufacturing bakelite and jade products and various electrical appliances, has recently invented a new quick-heating electric stove after much research and planning. Using scientific methods, it transmits the heat of the electric stove to the entire room with wind power. After several tests, it was found that in an average-sized room, one of these quick-heating electric stoves could raise the room temperature by more than ten degrees Celsius after fifteen minutes of use. Because the heat is transmitted to all directions using airflow, the temperature rises very evenly in all corners of the room after a short time, without any excessive cold or heat. Its efficiency is much higher than ordinary electric stoves or coal stoves. It is also lighter than the old-fashioned stoves and plated with chromium, making it beautiful and pleasing to the eye. It can be said to have the advantages of other stoves without their shortcomings. This type of quick-heating electric stove is sold at the China National Products Company and major electrical appliance stores in this city, and the price is quite low. It is said that purchases are very enthusiastic.</p>

Recently, it has been further reorganized, adding a low-cost obstetrics department and a dental department, hiring specialists to be responsible for each department, to ensure the safety of all patients.

<p>Special Publication Commemorating the Completion of the New Campus of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School</p>
<h3 id="e197">Preface <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Xigu</p>
<p>Today, we are delighted to see the completion of the new campus of our school. Looking back at the construction process, we owe a great deal to the support of the provincial and municipal governments, people from all walks of life, parents of students, and all teachers and students of the school. As we drink water, we remember the source, and we are filled with gratitude!</p>
<p>This publication narrates the relocation and reconstruction of our school, and includes photos of the new campus, compiled to inform those who have supported the development of our school. We believe this will be welcomed by all sectors of society.</p>
<p>However, the completion of the new campus can only be said to mark the end of a stage in material construction. As for the construction of the spiritual land, such as the enrichment of the school's content and the promotion of social improvement, it still depends on the supervision and guidance of the provincial and municipal governments and people from all walks of life, as well as the continued efforts of teachers and students in the school. Therefore, the compilation and printing of this publication is also intended to commemorate the past and encourage the future.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Construction Process of the New Campus of Our School <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of our school in 1927, we have felt that the school site and buildings were no longer suitable, which had a significant impact on teaching, training, and administrative efficiency. Therefore, a plan for relocation and construction was drawn up, which was finally completed after seven years of active progress. The details of the process are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Reasons for Relocation</p>
<p>1. Small School Site: The junior high school department of our school is located on Shangwen Road inside Xiaoximen, with a school site of 23.149 mu. The senior high school department is located on Lujiabang Road outside Xiaonanmen, with a school site of 18.464 mu, totaling 41.613 mu. When the reorganization took place, there were only 700 to 800 students, and it was already felt to be cramped. In recent years, the number of students has increased daily, making it even more crowded, with no room to accommodate them. There is no campus for recreation or playground for sports. If we want to add buildings, there is no space. If we want to purchase more land, the price is high and it is not easy to acquire. Therefore, if we want to develop Shanghai High School, relocation is necessary.</p>
<p>2. Dilapidated Buildings: The junior high school buildings of our school were originally the site of the Zishan Academy, so some of the buildings have been around for 100 to 200 years. The rest were added during the Second Normal School era. Apart from one three-story classroom building, the rest, such as dormitories, libraries, and instrument rooms, are old and dilapidated. Although a large amount of money is spent on repairs every year, they still cannot meet the needs. The senior high school buildings were originally the site of the Commercial Press, built more than 30 years ago. Although they look quite imposing, they are not suitable for school use. Moreover, both school buildings lack proper auditoriums, libraries, and laboratories for gatherings and research by all teachers and students. Therefore, the construction of new school buildings is urgent.</p>
<p>3. Separate School Buildings: The senior and junior high school departments of our school have been located in two separate locations. Although they are not far apart and transportation is convenient, the school expenses are equivalent to those of two schools, and it is difficult for teachers and students from both departments to communicate. The school administration feels burdened, and the school spirit is also affected.</p>
<p>4. Noisy and Dusty Environment: Both the senior and junior high school departments of our school are located in the busy urban area, adjacent to shops and factories. There is heavy traffic, noise, and dust, making the air very unclean, which is detrimental to health and unsuitable for studying and training.</p>
<p>Due to these four reasons, Principal Zheng proposed relocation and reconstruction in the overall plan of the school after the reorganization in 1927, in order to lay a foundation for Shanghai High School for the next 100 years and to become a perfect high school.</p>
<p>(2) Progress</p>
<p>1. Germination Period: Autumn 1927 to Autumn 1929</p>
<p>After our school planned to relocate and rebuild in the autumn of 1927, on the one hand, the school was in the initial stage of reorganization, and maintaining order and making it on the right track took up all the time and energy, so there was no time to talk about development. On the other hand, this matter was of great importance, and in addition to all the teachers, students, and alumni of the school, it also needed the understanding and support of government offices and people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>2. Brewing Period: Autumn 1929 to Summer 1930</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1929, our school drafted the reasons for relocation and the relocation plan in detail, and also drafted the planning map of the new campus and the phased construction methods of the new campus, and submitted them to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Education Department separately. The Provincial Government and the Education Department decided to submit them to the Jiangsu Education Funding Committee for discussion. After the Education Funding Committee formally passed the resolution and handed it over to the Education Department to carry out with this school, the relocation and reconstruction plan of our school was officially approved by the government.</p>
<p>3. Stagnation Period: Summer 1930 to Summer 1932</p>
<p>After the relocation and reconstruction of our school was approved by the Education Funding Committee, we planned to start the work. Initially, there was a dispute over the jurisdiction of the province and the city. Later, there was a water disaster and the national crisis of September 18th and January 28th, which resulted in the failure to proceed with the relocation plan for two years, which is a great regret.</p>
<p>4. Launch Period: Summer 1932 to Spring 1933</p>
<p>Since Director Zhou took charge of education in Jiangsu Province, he was determined to improve and spared no effort. Our school immediately submitted the relocation plan that had been stalled for two years for implementation, which was deeply supported. At that time, there was also a discussion about the jurisdiction of the province and the city, so the Provincial Government again submitted the reasons for relocation and the relocation plan of our school to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan approved it and ordered the Provincial Government to be responsible for the implementation. Therefore, the Provincial Government and the Education Department organized the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School New Campus Reconstruction Committee, and appointed one representative from the Provincial Government (entrusted by the Provincial Government to the Shanghai County Governor to represent), two section chiefs from the Provincial Education Department, Xiang Fu'an and Xue Qiaodong, the principal of this school, Zheng, and three local figures, Niu Tiansheng, Pan Gongzhan, and Wang Zhixin, as committee members, and designated the principal of this school, Zheng, as the chairman, to jointly plan and implement the relocation and reconstruction of this school. Therefore, the relocation and reconstruction plan of this school was smoothly implemented.</p>
<p>5. Implementation Period: Spring 1933 to Autumn 1934</p>
<p>Since the first meeting of the New Campus Reconstruction Committee on January 7, 1933, the relocation and reconstruction has been actively carried out. In one and a half years, the Reconstruction Committee has held ten meetings, and the Old Campus Site Valuation Committee has held one meeting. The details of the implementation are described below:</p>
<p>a. Obtaining Land License</p>
<p>Because our school wanted to bid for the old campus site and buildings and use the proceeds to purchase land for construction, the initial step was to write to the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau to issue a land license in order to start bidding. It took one year and four months from May 1932 to the end of August 1933 to officially obtain it. Initially, it took a long time to measure the school site, clean up the old field list and old grain declaration, and pay the field tax arrears for the past years before 1932. Later, due to the issue of provincial and municipal jurisdiction, the Land Bureau refused to issue it. Furthermore, the Municipal Farmers' Association and the District Farmers' Association prevented the sale of the former Xianmian Temple base. Principal Zheng contacted the Municipal Government Education Bureau and the Land Bureau dozens of times. Later, with the support of Mayor Wu, Director Pan, and Director Jin, the Municipal Government ordered the four bureaus of Land, Education, Finance, and Public Works to consult and issue the land license, and ordered the three bureaus of Land, Education, and Social Affairs to consult with this school to discuss the commemorative measures for the Xianmian Temple before the land license for the senior and junior high school departments was issued at the end of August.</p>
<p>b. Bidding for the Old Campus Site and Buildings</p>
<p>After our school obtained the land license, it followed the resolution of the New Campus Reconstruction Committee and wrote to the Xinhua Bank to bid for the old campus site and buildings on its behalf. In the early stage, the committee recommended five gentlemen, Gu Xinyi, Cao Zhenfei, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Zhixin, and Zheng Xigu, and one representative each from the Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau, to form a valuation committee to discuss the minimum bid price for the senior and junior high school sites and buildings. The Reconstruction Committee revised the bidding rules and advertised for bids. After two months, no one responded to the bid. In fact, it was because the situation had been affected by the times in recent years, and the commercial aspect showed a bleak picture. And the school site area of our school is wider, so no one consulted. Later, Mr. Yao Mulian, Lu Bohong, Zhang Xiaoliang and other gentlemen from Shanghai Inland Real Estate Company supported the relocation and construction plan of our school, and bid for the two old campus sites with more than 436,700 yuan, and then bid for the two old campus buildings with 1,500 yuan in July 1934, so the problem of bidding for the old campus site and buildings was finally over.</p>
<p>c. Selecting and Circling New Campus Site</p>
<p>When our school planned to relocate and rebuild, it paid attention to the selection of the new campus site, and at the same time looked for it in various places near the urban area. It seemed that the area south of Shanghai was more suitable. When the first meeting of the New Campus Reconstruction Committee was held, four principles for selecting the new campus site were resolved as follows: (1) Economic land price, (2) Convenient transportation, (3) Suitable environment, (4) Area of 300 to 500 mu, and with development potential. Soon after, the members went to the countryside to inspect and selected 450 mu of base opposite the Chinese Cemetery in Caojing District as the new campus site. In April 1933, according to the Land Requisition Law, a request was submitted to the Provincial Education Department, which was forwarded to the Provincial Government, which was forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior. The Ministry of the Interior replied and approved the purchase, and attached a public notice, and the Provincial Government asked the Municipal Government to order the Land Bureau to cooperate in the purchase. The Land Bureau surveyed and drew detailed maps, investigated the names of the original owners, and registered the mu and announced it in the newspaper. At the same time, Mr. Yang Fuyuan, the municipal commissioner of Caojing District, helped to proceed. Since January 1934, the purchase has been in progress, and the price of each mu of land is 200 yuan, and the price of each mu along the Shanghai-Minhang Road is increased by 100 yuan. After two months, nine out of ten have been purchased. At the same time, there are two villages on the school site, with 40 houses and many graves, with more than 1,000 coffins. At that time, the villagers were persuaded to move, and 200 yuan was subsidized for each house. Those who moved graves were subsidized 5 yuan, 10 yuan, or 20 yuan for each coffin. Our school has always taken helping farmers improve agriculture as its mission, so the compensation for the farmers to move houses and graves is given at the most fair value, so the nearby residents all love our school.</p>
<p>d. Constructing New School Buildings</p>
<p>The construction plan for the new campus of our school was drafted in the autumn of 1928. A construction budget was drawn up separately, and architect Qi Minghe was hired to design the drawings. The Xinhua Bank was entrusted to invite tenders for construction. The successful bidder was the Shanghai Zhichangtai Construction Factory, which built a Longmen Building, a Xianmian Hall, an auditorium, four student dormitories, two cafeterias, a bank, a consumer cooperative, a hospital, a gymnasium, seven faculty and staff residences, a water tower, and a gatehouse. The total construction cost was 466,000 yuan. Later, a primary school and a factory were added, totaling 32,000 yuan. Among them, except for a few bungalows, all are steel-concrete structures. Construction started on March 15, 1934, and the foundation stone laying ceremony was held on May 19. It was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of August, but was postponed to mid-October due to the huge project, and our school also moved into the new campus at the end of that month. Attached below is a summary table of construction expenses:</p>

<p>6. Completion Period｜Winter 1934</p>
<p>Since the construction of the new campus of our school started in March 1934, the project has progressed smoothly and was completed in mid-October. All tap water, electricity, telephones, and sanitary facilities are also fully equipped. The school sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting a police station from the Public Security Bureau, and a letter to the Postal Administration requesting a postal agency inside the campus. All aspects of life are very comfortable, and the scenery is elegant and the air is fresh, which is far from being comparable to the noisy cities. Our school moved entirely into the new campus from the 28th of that month. The relocation and construction of the school buildings, which had been planned and managed for seven years, was due to the efforts of Principal Zheng, and the concerted efforts of the provincial and municipal authorities, people from all walks of life, and teachers, students, and alumni. The completion ceremony for the new campus will be held on December 29 to celebrate the completion of the new campus.</p>
<p>(3) Future Plans</p>
<p>Although the initial construction plan of our school has been completed, there are many things to be done in the future. It is difficult to list all the things that need to be done. The following is a brief description of the two aspects of adding school buildings and running rural improvement:</p>
<p>1. Adding School Buildings: The construction this time is only the completion of the initial plan. In the next five years, we plan to add the following buildings:</p>
<p>Science Museum 80,000 yuan</p>
<p>Library 60,000 yuan</p>
<p>Swimming Pool 10,000 yuan</p>
<p>Female Dormitory 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Dormitory 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Student Extracurricular Activity Room 10,000 yuan</p>
<p>2. Running Rural Improvement: Our school bases education on life, and the school on society, so that all school facilities are integrated with social life, and the school becomes the center of transforming society. Therefore, we plan to try to run a rural improvement experimental area, starting with a small scope, and gradually promoting it when there are results. The experimental area will be within a radius of five miles around the school, with an area of approximately 80 square miles. The first step is to conduct various surveys in the experimental area, such as education surveys, economic surveys, and customs surveys. Next, based on the survey results, we will implement the following projects:</p>
<p>A. Universal Education: Universal education starts from two aspects: compulsory education and mass education. We will contact the Shanghai Municipal and County Education Bureaus to cooperate in carrying it out. We will set up primary schools in the experimental area to recruit school-age children, and set up mass schools to recruit out-of-school adults. Teachers and students of our school will take turns to teach, train, and manage all school affairs, and set up roving instructors to be responsible for guidance.</p>
<p>B. Improving Agriculture: We will designate 100 mu as a farm on the new site of our school, hire agricultural experts to manage it, and contact the agricultural experiment stations of National Central University and Jinling University to try out the superior seeds obtained after their experiments. We will also promote the new seeds to farmers. The farmer's supplementary school will be the place to instill agricultural knowledge. The farmer's supplementary school is attached to the farm and recruits young farmers aged 14 to 20. In addition to providing essential civic training, it also focuses on instilling agricultural knowledge and training agricultural skills, with a term of four years and 2 to 4 hours of teaching and practice time each day. The main aim is to cultivate the most efficient and healthy farmers.</p>
<p>C. Promoting Rural Sideline Products: In order to alleviate the decline of the rural economy, promoting rural sideline products is also an essential plan, such as raising chickens, ducks, bees, pigs, sheep, cattle, etc., and using vacant land to plant fruit trees and flowers. These are easy to organize, and the benefits are quite generous.</p>
<p>D. Running Credit Cooperatives: At present, the rural economy is extremely exhausted. Poor farmers often miss the farming season due to economic difficulties, so credit cooperation is an urgent plan. Our school bank plans to expand its service scope in the future and also run rural credit cooperation business. All farmers in the experimental area can borrow money from the bank. The interest rate is 1% per year, and no handling fee is charged. The procedures are very simple. Farmers only need to guarantee each other, and if the investigation confirms that there are no bad habits, the loan will be approved.</p>
<p>E. Running Consumer Cooperatives: For the purchase of daily necessities for farmers, this newspaper will contact farmers to form a consumer cooperative. A director will be set up, and business students from the school will take turns to serve. Consumers are all shareholders, and each share is 1 yuan. We will accept as many farmers' shares as possible. We will sell goods at a very low profit, and settle the accounts once at the end of the year. If there is a surplus, half will be distributed to the shareholders and half will be used for social welfare expenses.</p>
<p>F. Promoting Public Health: Our school doctor was originally set up to facilitate the treatment of diseases for teachers and students in the school. In the future, we plan to hire more doctors and assistants to treat farmers in the experimental area without charging medical fees. We will also provide medicine to the poor and pay attention to the prevention of diseases, such as vaccination and vaccination. The school doctor will be in charge of this. Students will use holidays to clean the streets and eliminate flies and other hygiene work.</p>
<p>G. Building Roads: For the convenience of rural transportation, our school and the villages in the experimental area must have a road of one zhang wide, which will be built jointly by teachers and students of our school and farmers. Before building the road, teachers and students of the school will publicize the meaning and importance of building the road to avoid resistance. When the economy is sufficient, coal slag or gravel will be added to the road to facilitate travel in rainy days.</p>
<p>H. Running the Defense Corps: The high school students of our school have been implementing military training for many years. In the future, we plan to focus on field exercises and assume the responsibility of defending the local area, in order to arouse the attention of farmers and gradually contact farmers to join the team and form a defense corps. The military instructors of our school will be responsible for training, and the students will assist in the handling of the team affairs, and the members will be half farmers and half students. In the future, students will gradually withdraw and farmers will gradually join, making it a purely farmer-organized defense corps.</p>
<p>Now, on the occasion of the completion of the new campus, I will briefly describe the reasons for the relocation and reconstruction of our school, as well as the progress and future plans. I hope that people from all walks of life will teach us.</p>

<h3 id="e209">National Prestige Defeated by West Tsinghai Pirates <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>59 Compared to 37, a Difference of 22</p>
<p>Accomplishments Still Not Profound, Heart Strong But Strength Insufficient</p>
<p>Hoping for National Prestige, Vowing to Destroy These Pirates</p>
<p>Without climbing high mountains, how can one know the plains? Observing the victories of the Central National Arts and Sports College basketball team over Datong and East Asia is truly like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves, encountering no resistance. However, watching last night's match against the West Tsinghai Pirates, it still couldn't satisfy people. The strategy was ordinary, the accomplishments not profound. The entire team lacked coordination and failed to utilize methods, shooting and throwing haphazardly, relying entirely on individual skills. Li Zhenzhong stood out like a crane among chickens, merely putting on an individual performance. Whether attacking or defending, he was exhausted, truly embodying the saying "the capable are burdened with more work." The situation was initially very tense, but the national team consistently remained at a disadvantage. Initially, they closely followed, but ultimately suffered a complete defeat. The first half ended 24-18, and the final result was 59-37.</p>
<h3 id="e210">West Tsing Municipality Benefits Threefold <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The Pirates are rampant in Shanghai, encountering no obstacles. The various Chinese teams in the Shanghai basketball scene are no match for them. This time, the arrival of the national team in Shanghai was expected to deliver a blow. Therefore, last night's match attracted a large crowd of spectators, eager to witness it. The West Tsing basketball hall was packed from top to bottom, and countless others were turned away. Based on location statistics, the attendance was probably around 1,000, marking the most spectacular event of this basketball season. The ticket prices of one dollar and five dimes were not considered expensive.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Pirates Are Indeed Formidable <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The fighting spirit of the Pirates is truly admirable. Their movements are agile, their passing skillful, their actions unpredictable and elusive. Smith's corner shots are accurate, consistently scoring cleanly without touching the rim, a sight to behold. Carlson and Shi Guiya are exceptionally fierce, penetrating every gap. The tall Lan Ying may appear clumsy, but for grabbing high balls, this person is essential. Li Zhenzhong was also unable to move freely due to the strict defense, preventing the national team from having any opportunities to shoot under the basket.</p>
<h3 id="e212">The National Team's Fatal Wound <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The national team's unfamiliarity with the venue undoubtedly reduced their strength. However, the lack of a tight defense was the fatal wound. Wu Wenzhong and Gao Changming were considered too short, and their inability to coordinate further exposed vulnerabilities. This allowed Smith to roam freely. Li Huizhong, seeing the unfavorable situation, had to retreat to help defend the rebounds. The entire team relied on Li's抢刦(qiang jie) to attack. The Zhang brothers were at a complete loss. In short, the entire team's skills were not yet refined, and they needed to pay much more attention to strategy. Slow movements were a major weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e213">From Then On, Always Inferior <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After the start, both sides dared not act recklessly, and the situation was extremely tense. West Tsing scored two consecutive points due to free throws. Li Zhenzhong's long-range shot was successful, accompanied by thunderous applause. Zhang Changjiang added one point due to Carlson's foul, taking a 3-2 lead. Carlson tied the score at 3-3. Zhang Changqing scored a free throw, leading again at 4-3. After that, the national team always remained inferior, only able to follow but never having another opportunity to show their strength. Smith and Shi Guiya launched a double-pronged attack, leading 7-4. The national team announced a time-out.</p>
<h3 id="e214">West Tsing Takes a Six-Point Lead <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Gao Changming dashed forward and scored, narrowing the gap to one point, trying to break the deadlock. However, there was no opening to exploit, circling in the center of the court, unable to penetrate the restricted area. Smith plundered and scored two more goals. After 12-6, Wu Wenzhong also returned two goals, hoping to reach the summit. However, things didn't go as planned. Lan Ying and Carson scored seven points in a row, making it 19-10. Li Zhenzhong, sensing the unfavorable situation, volunteered to attack. He managed to get under the basket once and scored. A half-court shot also hit the target. The situation seemed to be turning around. Suddenly, two time-outs were called, and from then on, the score gradually widened. The first half ended 24-18, with West Tsing leading by six points.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Only Li Zhenzhong Suffered <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>At this point in the game, the outcome seemed predetermined. However, people hoped that the national team could suddenly deliver a surprise in the second half and perform a earth-shattering feat. Ultimately, the team's lineup didn't improve, and their heart was willing but their strength was insufficient. When the second half started, the Pirates remained the same, and the national team became even more sluggish, suffering more losses than gains. In the first five minutes, the score remained a six-point difference: 26-20, 28-22, 30-24. After that, it became 35-26. Li Zhenzhong refused to be outdone, attacking and defending tirelessly, but Smith continued to score corner shots, and Shi Guiya also broke free from restraints, becoming very arrogant. The score jumped to 51-28, a difference of 23 points, the largest difference in the entire game.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Unable to Turn the Tide <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>West Tsing was already in firm control of the victory. The veteran Sullivan was brought on, and the situation gradually eased. Gao Changming, Zhang Changqing, and Li Zhenzhong each scored, but the tide had already turned, and it was impossible to save the situation. The final result was 59 points for West Tsing and 37 points for the national team. Smith scored 26 points alone, and Li Zhenzhong scored 16 points. The two teams still need to meet once more. It is hoped that the national team will work hard and avenge last night's defeat.</p>

<p>The Beining Football Team, Champion of North China, Arrives in Shanghai Today</p>
<h3 id="e217">The New Year's Day Shen Yuan vs. East China Interport Match Postponed for Two Weeks <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Beining football team, champion of North China, is coming south for a challenge. The entire team of 15 players traveled south on the Jinpu Railway the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>After resting for another day tomorrow, they will play against East China in Shen Yuan on New Year's Day, and against Yoyo on the 3rd. The Shanghai West League Football Association originally scheduled the first interport trial match to be held in Shen Yuan on January 2nd, but due to the arrival of Beining, it has been decided to postpone it to January 12th or 13th. The Beining players arriving in Shanghai today are Xiao Shilieci.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Chen Erde: In the interport match between Tianjin and Shanghai a few years ago, Tianjin won 7-1. The Shanghai goalkeeper was Zhou Xianyan, and the Tianjin team had Chen Erde. That day, he definitely saved many dangerous shots, and thus became famous throughout the country, comparable to Zhou Xianyan, and nicknamed "Little Monkey."</p>
<p>Right Back Wang Baoxiang: Mentioning the words "Leng Wang" (Stubborn Wang) is very famous in Tianjin. The so-called "Leng" means that he is not afraid of anything. Rushing the ball and intercepting the ball are his only specialties. He is also good at heading the ball. He was the defender for the Chinese team in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Left Back Sun Guilin: He represented the North China region in the finals against the East China region in Beiping. Because he is a driver and has a burly body, he is nicknamed "Locomotive." He's very powerful when he kicks the ball.</p>
<p>Center Back Sun Sijing: A veteran of the Far East Games and the only center back for China, he doesn't need any introduction. Some people say he is old, but his killing technique is getting more and more powerful. If you don't believe it, wait and see.</p>
<p>Left Defender Sun Yating: Mr. Sun looks very honest, but he is really scary when he steals the ball. He is a member of the Hebei Provincial Team and the Tianjin Chinese Team.</p>
<p>Right Defender Liang Mingzong: This man is short and capable, known as "Desperate Saburo." He is a member of the Tianjin Chinese Team and the Hebei Provincial Team. He goes all out on the field. His legs and arms have been injured, but he still goes all out.</p>
<p>Center Forward Zhao Qichun: "Zhao Qichun flies all over the field" is a common saying among Tianjin fans. His skill can be imagined. He is a core player in Beiping's top teams, and also plays for the Tianjin Chinese Team and the Hebei Provincial Team. Left Winger Jiang Lu: The only left winger in North China, he represented Tianjin in the interport match in Shanghai. He is steady and fast, a natural talent. "Little Jiang Lu, really good, Tianjin, you're the fastest," is a ballad sung by Tianjin fans.</p>
<p>Right Winger Qin Ming: He is a young player from Beiping. After joining Beining, his skills have greatly improved. He represented the Tianjin Chinese Team. He has a good foot and is most confident in corner kicks.</p>
<p>Right Forward Sun Yongquan: Young and strong, and good at running. He was very famous at the North China Games this year. There's no need to say more about his skills.</p>
<p>Left Forward Sun Fulai: Among the northern forwards, he is the best at grounded shots. He is skilled at dribbling and passing. He is an important member of the Tianjin Chinese Team and the Hebei Provincial Team.</p>
<p>Rising Star Zhou Jian: This time, he represented Hebei Province in the North China Intermediate Games. This is the man who broke through East China's defense while representing Zhenhuan in Beiping.</p>
<p>Liu Zhongyuan, Zheng Jinbo, Wu Shen: The above three gentlemen are all meritorious players of Beining. For several years, they have repeatedly won the Tianjin Divisional Championship and the Interport Championship, thanks in large part to the strength of these three gentlemen.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Today's East China vs. West Concession Police Match Postponed <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The Field is Unsuitable After Rain Both Sides Unwilling to Take Risks The West League A Group football match between East China and West Concession Police, originally scheduled to take place today at Shen Yuan, is akin to a final for East China in Group A. Currently, the only team that still has hope of competing with East China is the West Concession Police. However, because the Shen Yuan field is low-lying and heavily saturated with water, making it muddy and unsuitable for play, and the West Concession Police sent personnel to Shen Yuan in advance to inspect, both sides are unwilling to take risks, and have decided to postpone the match until the end of next season.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Unexpectedly, Innis Defeated Yoyo <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>A Score of Two to One</p>
<p>The mediocre Innis football team suddenly showed its brilliance yesterday, defeating Yoyo by a score of 2-1. This was a West League Group A match. After a long period of rain, the Yiyuan field was muddy and slippery, making movement quite difficult. Yoyo's forwards were disorganized and sluggish, but fortunately their defense was solid and effective, conceding only one goal. Zhang Rongbiao's goalkeeping was bold and meticulous, saving countless dangerous shots, earning a lot of applause.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Goalkeeping Was Commendable <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Innis' coordination was wonderful, their running swift, their forwards outstanding, and their defense impeccable. The whole team was united, displaying a variety of beautiful techniques and a strong offensive. Fortunately, the new player Zhang Rongbiao did a good job of guarding the goal. Jiang Shanjing's tight defense repeatedly repelled the strong forces. The forwards were unremarkable, disorganized, and ineffective. After conceding a score of 1-2 in the first half, there were no further achievements in the second half. The performance of both sides was not as brilliant as in the first three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Goal Was Breached First <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Innis kicked off and attacked first. Within three minutes, Kang Pei'er approached the city and reached the baseline of Yoyo's goal. Wang Shusen failed to stop him, and he was shot into the goal horizontally, which was extremely miraculous. Then, Innis' right winger sent in a corner kick. The forwards surrounded and shot, but failed to score. The momentum was astonishing. On the other hand, Yoyo's forwards were hesitant and unsatisfied. Sun Jinshun occasionally got the ball and broke through, reaching an undefended area. Innis' left inside quickly chased him down, and Lao Sun immediately passed the ball to the goal, but it was too far off and missed.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Saved a Penalty Kick <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The audience witnessed Lao Sun's failure to make the pass and sighed regretfully. Unexpectedly, misfortune did not come singly. Luo Haiguang committed a foul in front of his own goal and was penalized with a penalty kick. The enemy's left inside kicked the ball, which hit the goalkeeper's body in the middle of the goal and was saved by the goalkeeper, narrowly escaping danger and rejoicing. However, Innis' momentum was extremely strong, and enemy traces were densely distributed in front of Yoyo's goal. Jiang and Wang, the two defenders, and Zhang, the goalkeeper, saved many dangerous shots.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Enemy Balls Came Like a String of Pearls <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhiming, who had been quiet for a long time, forced a corner kick. Although the pass was good, nothing was achieved. Yun Feng搶劫qiang jied the ball beside the enemy's feet and sent it out. Yong Sen brought it forward and penetrated deep into the enemy's territory, passing it to the front of the goal. Sun Jinshun was in an offside position and the shot was not counted. Suddenly, the rear was attacked again. Kang Pei'er passed the ball to the front, and Zhang Rongbiao left the goal and missed. The enemy's center forward headed the ball towards the empty goal, but fortunately it hit the crossbar and bounced back. Li Shengguan kicked it out. However, the enemy's arrogance was immense, and the balls shot like a string of pearls, extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Still Remained at a Disadvantage <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Luo Haiguang suddenly rescued Ah Dou from the chaotic army, hurried forward, passed it to Yong Sen, and then passed it to Wang Nanzhen again. Wang brought it forward a few steps and returned it to the front of the goal. Sun and Luo were blocked, and Lu Zhiming chased after them like a bird, shooting diagonally into the goal with a hard and beautiful kick. Before the cheers stopped, the enemy's Goner dodged Yun Fengdi and scored a goal easily, making it 2-1. Yoyo still remained at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Situation Was Relatively Relaxed <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>After the first half, the situation was relatively relaxed. Sun Jinshun's free kick from 20 yards in front of the enemy's goal was ineffective. Innis had very few opportunities to shoot due to Yoyo's tight defense, and because their kicks were inaccurate, they achieved nothing. Thompson once shot hard at the goal, but the ball bounced back from the post. Yoyo was eager to retaliate and ambitious, but because of bad luck and disorganized lineup, they repeatedly missed opportunities. Luo Haiguang once shot a side shot, but it was weak and ineffective. Lu Zhiming also shot a ball, but it also missed.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Yoyo Became Even More Sluggish <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Later, Zhong Yongsen injured his leg and switched to winger. Lu Zhiming was assigned to inside forward. Before long, Liang Shutang was promoted to inside forward, Lu switched to inside back, and Wang Shusen replaced Liang as forward. The Chen line became even more sluggish. Rushing back and forth, neither side made any special progress, toiling in vain and accomplishing nothing. Finally, the enemy's Goner stole a chance to shoot in front of Yoyo's goal, soaring into the sky and causing the audience to be alarmed.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Zhejiang Provincial Education Department Asks Finance Department to Issue Arrears <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Director Xu Promised to Raise and Issue 160,000 Yuan First</p>
<p>Zhejiang's education funding has never been sufficient. In recent years, many schools have been added, but the funding has increased very little. The budget for each school has been repeatedly tightened. Fortunately, there are special funds to guarantee, but the amount of special funds only accounts for 60% of the total education and cultural funds. Recently, the provincial treasury has been exhausted, and schools have not been able to receive the remaining funds, except for the special fund portion. In total, 65% of the funds for the months of July, August, September have not been received, and 40% of the funds for the months of October and November have not been received. The amount of funds that have not been received by counties and the provincial treasury before June is even greater. To date, the total amount of funds owed by the Finance Department to schools is more than 400,000 yuan. The amount owed to each school is at least three months and up to more than one year. Although repeated appeals have been made, there has been no effect. When the provincial government was about to close, it used a borrowed sum of one million yuan to issue arrears to all departments, including non-directly affiliated institutions of the provincial government, such as the courts. Only the education department was not considered. Therefore, the salaries of officials in each department have been issued until the end of December, while the salaries of schools have only been issued until the first half of August. The treatment is obviously very different when comparing them. Now that the semester is coming to an end, all expenses need to be paid, and the advanced funds need to be repaid. All schools are desperately short of money and have been forced to do so. All the principals and administrators of provincial schools in the province gathered in Hangzhou yesterday to petition the Education and Finance Departments. Those who arrived in Hangzhou included Xiang Dingrong of Hangzhou High School, Fang Hao of Jinhua Middle School, Liang Yihao of Quzhou Middle School, Wang Peide of Yanling Middle School, Zhang Yintong of Jiaxing Middle School, Zhou Xiang of Huzhou Middle School, Shen Jinxiang of Shaoxing Middle School, Shen Qida of Ningbo Middle School, Tang Shifang of Hangzhou Junior Middle School, Sun Jianwen of Hangzhou Girls' Middle School, Xiao Wei of Taizhou Middle School, Cheng Hao of Medical College, Lin Ben of People's Education Practical School, Chen Shimin of Sericulture School, Chen Xunci of Provincial Library, and Hu Douwen of Provincial People's Education Center, and more than 20 others. They first went to the Education Department at 3:00 PM, where they were received by Director Xu. Each representative presented their difficult situation and the purpose of the petition. Director Xu promised to do his best to forward the request to the Finance Department for supplementary funding. They then went to the Finance Department, where they were also received by Director Xu. Each representative stated their intention, and Director Xu expressed his understanding. He promised to raise and issue 160,000 yuan before the end of the year, and the remaining funds would be issued continuously. Each representative expressed their satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Education Department, in order to promote national sports, previously organized a provincial sports committee and formulated a preliminary plan to promote national sports. It has been found that 43 counties, including Hangzhou County, have not followed the above plan to establish their respective county sports committees. Yesterday, a special order was issued to urge them to establish the committees within one month and to report the various measures for approval.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Ministry of Education Explains the Education Association Law and Elementary School Regulations <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on the report of Li Wenwei, stated that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association has not yet been completed and requested permission from the Provincial Party Department to establish it. The Provincial Party Department stipulates that each county's representative to the Provincial Education Association is limited to one person. According to Article 15 of the Implementing Rules of the Education Association Law, the representative of the county and city education association shall not exceed three people, which seems to allow for one to three people. What should be followed? Furthermore, Article 78, Paragraph 3, Section 1 of the Elementary School Regulations stipulates that those who have served as elementary school teachers for more than three years and are recognized by the education administrative organs as having made definite achievements may be exempted from examination and assessment. The so-called education administrative organ is organized by education administrative personnel. Those who are recognized as having made definite achievements seem to be determined based on the inspection reports of education administrative personnel, but whether education committee members are included in the administrative personnel and whether the inspection comments of education committee members are valid, etc. The following are separate instructions: (1) The representative of the county and city education association shall not exceed three people as stated in Article 15 of the Implementing Rules of the Education Association Law means that the maximum shall not exceed three people. As for the number of representatives, it shall be stipulated in the constitution by the higher-level education association in accordance with the provisions of the same article. (2) The definite proof of the education administrative organ is required for those who are recognized by the education administrative organ as having made definite achievements as stipulated in Article 78, Paragraph 3 of the Elementary School Regulations. For example, the education administrative organ gives comments on teaching, training, and other achievements based on the inspection report, and recognizes that definite achievements have been made. Let it be known immediately.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai High School, the new school building located in Wujiagang, covering an area of 450 mu, is a model for high schools nationwide. Yesterday morning, the completion ceremony of the new school building and the 7th-anniversary celebration were held. The student military parade was originally scheduled for the afternoon, but due to the ground being wet, it could not be held. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e237">Attendees <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>A total of approximately 1,500 to 1,600 people attended, including Director Zhou Fo-hai of the Jiangsu Education Department, Section Chief Xue Qiao-dong, Zhang Yuan-ruo representing Mayor Wu, Director Pan Gong-zhan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Director Wu Xing-ya of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, as well as Ou Yuan-huai, Jiang Wen-yu, Ren Meng-xian, Liao Zhen-ru, Chen Ji-cheng, Wang Zhi-hua, Xu Ze-xiang, Yao Mu-lian, Lu Bo-hong, Zhang Peng-chun, Cao Chu, Zhang Hai-cheng, Zhou Hou-shu, Peng Wei-ji, Wu Yuan-ji, Tang Zhi-cai, Teng Yang-zhi, along with faculty, alumni, guests, and students. The atmosphere was lively and prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e238">A Glimpse <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The school's land covers more than 450 mu, which is very large. The southwest is a sports field, the northwest is a farm, and the east is the school building. The buildings that have already been constructed include a Longmen Building, a Xianmian Hall, an auditorium, a factory, a gymnasium, an elementary school, four student dormitories, six dining halls, six kitchens, seven faculty residences, and a hospital and cooperative. The exterior is extremely solemn and grand, and the interior is even more substantial and rich. The achievements are remarkable and impressive, truly a model among secondary schools nationwide.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Ceremony Details <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM, the completion ceremony and 7th-anniversary celebration were held in the auditorium, presided over by Principal Zheng Xi-gu, with Zhang Zhong-bao and Lu Shao-ji providing hospitality. After the ceremonial rituals, Principal Zheng Xi-gu first reported on the construction process and the significance of the anniversary. Then, Director Zhou Fo-hai of the Jiangsu Education Department, Zhang Yuan-ruo representing Mayor Wu, Director Pan Gong-zhan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Director Wu Xing-ya of the Social Affairs Bureau, and guest Zhang Peng-chun delivered speeches successively. Following that, representatives of the faculty and students delivered speeches. The ceremony concluded with the playing of music, a group photograph, and adjournment.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Chairman's Report <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Zheng Xi-gu reported, roughly stating that today the school is holding the completion ceremony and 7th-anniversary celebration. It is a great honor to have the presence of officials and guests. There are two layers of significance to today's meeting. First, the school's construction and relocation have been successfully carried out with the support of all parties, which is greatly appreciated. Second, the work of the school's teachers and students will be even greater in the future, and it will require the assistance and guidance of the government, the community, and the parents of students at all times. Since the reorganization in the 16th year of the Republic, the school has had a plan to relocate. The plan was submitted to the Provincial Government and the Education Department in the 18th year of the Republic, and it was actively carried out with the assistance of Director Zhou and the municipal authorities in the 21st year of the Republic. A committee was also organized to take charge of the matter. First, the old site was sold for 470,000 yuan. At the same time, 450 mu of land was purchased in Wujiagang for a total of 110,000 yuan, the construction of the school building cost 490,000 yuan, the equipment cost 100,000 yuan, and other expenses amounted to 20,000 yuan, totaling 730,000 yuan. The income fell short by 100,000 yuan, and fundraising is currently underway. Now that the school building has been completed, the work of the school's teachers and students will be even greater. Only by boosting spirits can they live up to the expectations of all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Director Zhou's Speech <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Director Zhou Fo-hai of the Jiangsu Education Department gave a speech, roughly stating that it is a great pleasure to participate in the completion ceremony of the new Shanghai High School building. Just now, listening to Principal Zheng's report, from the planning and sale of the old site to the completion of the new school building, countless difficulties were encountered before reaching today's goal. This is entirely due to the assistance of the municipal authorities and all parties, as well as the efforts of Principal Zheng and the faculty. Today, I, on behalf of the provincial government, express my gratitude to the Shanghai municipal authorities and all sectors of society, and offer my condolences to Principal Zheng and others. At the same time, I hope that the Shanghai municipal authorities will continue to provide assistance, and I hope that Principal Zheng and others will continue to work hard. The new Shanghai High School building can be considered one of the best in China. At the same time, I hope that the students of Shanghai High School will reach the same level of excellence in their physical fitness and academic knowledge. Chairman Chiang recently inspected various places in the Northwest and believes that various undertakings have made progress, but education has not made progress. The reason for this is the lack of physical strength. The reason for the lack of physical strength is nothing more than insufficient nutrition, overwork, or lack of exercise. I hope that the students of Shanghai High School will quickly strengthen their physical fitness. Second, they must cultivate their personality and develop the ability to adapt to the environment. Third, they must increase their knowledge. If the students can focus on these three points, then the relocation of Shanghai High School will have meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Mayor Wu's Speech <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Yuan-ruo, representing Mayor Wu, said that the new Shanghai High School building covers an area of 450 mu, and its excellent environment makes it a standard high school in China. Principal Zheng Xi-gu is a strong researcher of secondary education and can be considered a standard principal. Having a standard school and a standard principal, it is impossible not to have standard students. The importance of the status of young students is undeniable. If we want to create a strong and beautiful nation, we need to cultivate standard young students from today onwards. Today's youth must recognize the relationship between national life and cultivate future talents to carry on the past and create the driving force for the creation of national life. Youth and the nation are like white blood cells and the human body. Without white blood cells, the human body is prone to disease. Without standard youth, the nation will be in immediate danger. I hope that from today's completion of the new school building, a large number of new young people will be cultivated to build the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Director Pan's Speech <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau said that he just heard the speeches of Director Zhou and Mr. Zhang representing Mayor Wu, who said that to be a standard young person, one must cultivate oneself in terms of physical fitness, knowledge, and personality. I have some additional opinions to add. First, in addition to cultivating physical fitness, personality, and knowledge, young people must also have a national spirit and a spirit of the times. The national spirit is vertical, with historical connections, and the spirit of the times is horizontal, with geographical connections. Young people cultivated from these two spirits are the young people China needs. Furthermore, education should have a consistent goal. Standard students are created under the rules and norms of principals and teachers. Therefore, the issue of teachers is very important. Hu Shi recently had a theory that young people should explore on their own. Blindly groping for ten years can find a way out. He also said that if Chinese youth do not believe in Marxism at the age of twenty, they will not be successful, and if they believe in Marxism at the age of thirty, they will also not be successful. This kind of arrogant argument is beyond description. I hope that students of Shanghai High School, under the leadership of standard teachers, will never blindly follow the words of such university professors when they enter university in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Director Wu's Speech <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Director Wu Xing-ya of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau said that the gentlemen just spoke about nothing more than the cultivation of physical fitness, personality, and knowledge. At the same time, young people must have a national spirit and a spirit of the times, and it is especially important not to blindly follow the arrogant words of university professors. It is very important to accept the opinions of the gentlemen, but I believe that the most important thing is to first restore national self-confidence. Young people should not talk empty words in this era, but should start from the root. The gentlemen have already spoken in great detail. In recent years, the slogan of revitalizing the nation has permeated the country. To revitalize the Chinese nation and build a new China, this responsibility lies on the shoulders of the youth who carry on the past and open up the future.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Financial Gold Market Experiences Sharp Fluctuations <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Kuan Gold Plummets, Exchange Rate Tightens, Once Reaching 60 Yuan; Rumors of Favorable News Lead to Buying Activity, Rebounding 2.7 Yuan</p>
<p>The market yesterday was characterized by fluctuating sentiment and extremely narrow margins. With a single change, the fluctuations were significant. Initially, the overall trend was downward due to the tightening exchange rate, with multiple parties continuously collapsing. However, in the end, due to various rumors unfavorable to the selling side, there was excitement, and the buying surge rebounded quickly. Initially, overseas silver markets in England and America rose in unison, and the forward silver price in MonteVideo rose by another six points, slightly contracting the exchange rate. The price of raw gold in London remained unchanged. When off-site preparatory trading opened, it immediately retreated to 62.3 yuan, and then retreated within 1 yuan. Major players such as Fuxing, Yongheng, and Yu made efforts to buy, gradually rebounding. The Central Bank's listing revealed that the British pound rose by 1.25 and the US dollar rose by 2.5. The customs gold unit fell by another 1.5 points, and the standard gold price retreated to 999 yuan and 20 cents, leading to a fall immediately after opening. Although the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu stuffed shillings first, the gradual recovery was good due to the healthy absorption of banks. Although there was a struggle because it was known that the HSBC bank would list a rise of 1.25 for the British pound and 2.5 for the US dollar, the exchange rate tightened at this time, and major players purchased in unison, rising once. However, because those who took the opportunity to sell at high prices were still active, the price gradually fell back. At this time, because the banks were still absorbing, the white silver balance tax was revealed to have risen by 2.5, calculated at 6% and the British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling and 5 pence and 59375, which was relatively stable. Unexpectedly, the buying absorption of HSBC and other banks suddenly stagnated, and the banks suddenly had a selling absorption, so the exchange rate reported loose and excessive. Major players took the opportunity to sell off, and the buying side panicked again, and the downward trend was formed. Although China tried to maintain it, the supply was greater than the demand, which made buyers dare not act. The price fell below the 60-yuan mark and then fell to a low price of 56.5 yuan. The price was maintained when the price was low, and the selling wind also stopped, gradually rising back to more than 60 yuan. Many parties saw an opportunity and worked hard. The table was very barren because the short position had increased too much, and floating households were unable to supply the terms. Therefore, rumors unfavorable to the short position, such as the failure of the Sino-British loan and various rumors that aroused buying sentiment, rose again, and the market reported that the demand was greater than the supply. The Guangdong gang also made up for the advance, and the buying momentum was constant for a while, and the rebound was extremely fast, once approaching the 70-yuan mark. In the end, the exchange rate was normal, and the supply sources took advantage of the high prices, and the situation was stable at noon. The half-day market situation was difficult to grasp, and the changes were extremely fast. The half-day market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening price: 962 yuan and 90 cents, a decrease of 1 yuan and 10 cents compared to the previous closing price.

Although Qiao Zhifu stuffed shillings, the HSBC Zhengjin both absorbed 375 in March, rising to 5 yuan and 50 cents. Knowing that the HSBC bank would list a rise of 1.25 for the British pound and 2.5 for the US dollar, Fuxingyong Dafayong sold to 4 yuan and 30 cents. Hua Bi absorbed the US dollar at 34 yuan and 75 cents in December and the US dollar at 33 yuan and 5625 in March, which was difficult to settle. Hengyu Qingfayong advanced to 5 yuan and 70 cents.

Yuxinxiang Dingkang Yongli Hengyu Yuyu and others took the opportunity to dispose of their holdings at high prices, falling to 3 yuan and 80 cents.

Fuxingyong Yuanchangyong Qianchangxiang and others still sold, falling to 5 yuan and 80 cents. Qianchangxiang Yuanchangyong Tianfengyong and others came to buy again, rising to 7 yuan and 90 cents.

<h3 id="e256">Continued Rise in Listed Prices, Initial Relaxation then Tightening of Foreign Exchange Rates <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Uneven Appetite Among Banks, Overall Trend Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday,</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches, London spot and forward silver both rose by 25, American silver rose by half a point, forward silver also rose by 6 li, London gold remained unchanged, the pound sterling against the US dollar decreased by 0.375, the US dollar against the pound sterling decreased by 0.25, the pound sterling against the French franc decreased by 10 points, the US dollar against the French franc increased by 0.625. The exchange market opened in the morning with spot selling prices: pound sterling at 1 shilling 4 pence 875, US dollar at 34.75 yuan. Compared to the previous close, both pound sterling and US dollar were flat. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced: pound sterling up 125, US dollar up 25, customs gold unit down 1.5 points. Chinese merchants' sentiment was unstable, and there seemed to be a relaxation after the opening. However, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and others tied up the shilling, so even though the Jewish merchant, George Joseph, sold, the process remained flat. Banks still had a strong appetite for buying, and the US dollar once tended to tighten. HSBC's listed prices were announced: pound sterling up 125, US dollar up 25. By this time, it was already set. Afterwards, HSBC and others' appetite weakened, and the situation gradually relaxed. The silver balancing tax was announced to rise by 25, calculated at 6 percent. The pound sterling, calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 59375, still seemed mediocre. Afterwards, the Bank of East Asia, Mitsui, and others supplied silver, lacking buyers. The process thus hardened repeatedly. When banks took the opportunity to buy cheap, the domestic market turned stable. Rumors unfavorable to short sellers spread again. Although there were few transactions, the situation was more stable and gradually tightened. By the afternoon close, the spot selling prices were: pound sterling at 1 shilling 4 pence 8125, US dollar at 34.75 yuan. Compared to the previous close, there was still no change. Forward rates were slightly tighter. Chinese merchants initially sold, then bought, slightly buying back after being squeezed. Banks' appetite for buying was not strong.

<p>The February Public Bonds Debuted Yesterday</p>
<p>Active Swap Trading</p>
<p>Market Price Remains Inverted</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, February futures debuted and were in great demand in the market, especially swap trades. The forward market price was still higher than the spot price, but retail arbitrage showed a sense of interest. However, due to the dollar interbank loan rate being as high as 5 jiao 5 fen, the market was significantly affected. However, this was only a temporary phenomenon during the financial sector's year-end settlement period, so short sellers did not dare to take any action. With everyone restraining each other, the market formed a state of confusion. Looking at yesterday's market, the opening market was under high pressure from the dollar interbank loan rate, and people's hearts were weak. Furthermore, because the bond market would no longer exist this year, and there would be a five-day closure due to the New Year holiday and weekly holidays, many people closed their positions to avoid risk, so the debt reduction suddenly fell by as much as half a yuan at the start. Afterwards, the situation gradually stabilized and swap trading suddenly became active. Comparing the eagerness of the long positions, the market price was weaker and fell by 2 or 3 jiao. In the second session, the leading debt reduction recovered 2 or 3 jiao, but the others were still weak and unable to rise due to the long position swap trades. Afterwards, the short position swaps suddenly rose, and the market suddenly turned firm. In the two afternoon sessions, due to the high clearinghouse transfer rate, people's hearts were timid and doubtful, and the absorption of long positions was not strong, so the market price mostly went downstream. In summary, the result of the market price for the whole day was a slight drop of 5 fen to 4 jiao 5 fen. However, salt tax and the Twenty-Three Customs bonds rose by 1 jiao to 2 jiao 5 fen. The total transaction volume was 17,596,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>A report from Sino-American Trading Corporation stated that yesterday (December 28th), the New York stock market, with a flurry of good commercial news, shed its recent sluggishness and suddenly turned strong, with gains not seen since September. Trading was light, but there were large tax-loss selling. Automobile stocks were very strong. US Steel's workload is about to continue to increase, so steel stocks also rose. Railway material stocks advanced, hoping that the government could help the railways and that the railways would be able to purchase new materials. General Electric announced the redemption of the company's preferred stock at $11, and the redemption of 3.5% bonds due January 1, 1935 and January 1, 1942. After the announcement, trading in the company's common stock was very active. Traders paid attention to the rise in silver prices, and the rise in silver prices was due to the silver faction resuming activities and the United States buying in the London market. The bond market was boosted by the stock market, and small exchange stocks also rose. Chicago wheat was firm due to the strength of corn. The total volume for the day was 1.28 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Lively, Cotton Demand Nonexistent</p>
<p>Yarn</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still stable, and people are hopeful because the Indian and American cotton markets are constantly rising. Indian cotton is also gradually reaching new highs. However, the exchange rate is slightly high, and the exchange price can still be evened out. Current yarn brokers' sales are still smooth. As far as foreign cotton is concerned, the future of yarn and cotton can be determined. The current yarn transaction is 690 bales, and the market is stable. The purchase volume of each group is as follows: Guangdong 30, Zhenjiang 10, Inland 265, South 80, Ningbo 10, Colleagues 55, Shantou 10, Changsha 50, Sichuan 100.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market is quite firm because Indian cotton is rising more and more, and gold prices are also slightly rising. However, the current cotton demand is extremely quiet. There are no transactions. The source of arrival is 773 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>Yarn</p>
<p>The December gold yarn futures were listed on July 2nd of this year. The opening price of the first session was 184.8 yuan, slightly down to 3.7 yuan. At this time, rumors about the Shenxin factory were spreading, and there were various discussions in the market, saying that the factory would completely stop work for reorganization. General speculators had delusions because the factory had a large production capacity. If it really stopped, it would have a significant impact on the market. Buyers swarmed in. At the same time, the climate in the country was extremely dry, the cotton market was firm, and the financial sector also bought a large amount to go long. The demand for coarse yarn from North China was also smooth. The market gradually trended upward, and there was once a lively scene. The highest price was around 191 yuan. Unexpectedly, the United States implemented a policy of buying silver, the price of silver rose sharply, and the price of gold trended down, causing the prices of goods in our country to appear quite unstable. The exchange rate of the Japanese yen increased to more than 127 yuan, causing Japanese merchants to sell off aggressively. The market fell further and further, and the lowest price was 170.05 yuan. Later, in October, the government, in view of the increasing outflow of silver, increased the export tax and added a balancing tax on silver to maintain the stability of Shanghai's finance, which caused the weak and sluggish yarn market to suddenly soar, and the highest price reached 188.8 yuan. Extending to the middle of this month, it hovered between 182 and 183 yuan for a long time. Later, due to a large household receiving goods, the last session jumped wildly to 187 yuan. The result of the delivery price was 180 yuan, which was 3 yuan higher than the November period. There were 5,750 bales remaining. The actual delivery was 2,300 bales of 20-count Saiyu yarn, 350 bales of Ren Zhong, 150 bales of Baoyi, and 150 bales of Shepherd. The rest were self-delivered. Wu was the largest receiver, followed by Tongcheng Company. The broker numbers and bale amounts of the receiving and delivering manufacturers and arbitrageurs are listed below (unit: bales).</p>

<p>Cotton</p>
<p>The December standard cotton futures were listed on July 2nd of this year. The opening price of the first session was 35.3 yuan, slightly down to around 4 yuan. Later, due to the dry climate in the country and the drought that had already formed, the development of new cotton was greatly affected. American cotton fields were reduced, and everyone unanimously hoped for an increase. The highest price was 37 yuan. Although the government's estimated announcement on August 8th was an increase, Wang of a yarn factory and Tongcheng Company aggressively sold off about 200,000 dan. The market was under pressure, and the market price gradually decreased from 37 yuan. Later, in the middle of October, the national cotton report estimated a bumper harvest due to a large increase in the number of people who changed to planting cotton fields because agricultural products were cheap in the previous year. Buyers were disappointed. At the same time, the yarn market did not rise, and there were many factories reducing working hours. As a result, the cotton market had a low of 33 yuan. Until the middle of October, the national government prevented the outflow of silver, increased the export tax on silver, and added a balancing tax. The price of gold rose sharply, and the prices of all goods soared. The price of cotton rose from 34 yuan straight to 38 yuan. Extending to this month, it hovered outside 36 yuan for a long time. As a result, the last session price was 36.1 yuan, which was 4.5 jiao lower than the November price. There were 18,200 dan remaining. The actual delivery was only 5,800 dan, and the rest were self-delivered. The goods included Yao cotton, Shandong coarse velvet, and Hankou group velvet. The delivery price was 36.5 yuan. The broker numbers and bale amounts of the receiving and delivering parties are listed below (unit: dan).</p>

<p>|Increase of One to Two Yuan for Fine Velvet Grades|</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange held a cotton appraisal meeting on December 23rd to supply the delivery for the June 24th period. As a result of the appraisal of grade changes, the original addition of 7 yuan for Grade 1 Medium B was changed to an addition of 6 yuan, the original addition of 6 yuan for Grade C was changed to an addition of 4.5 yuan, and the original addition of 5 yuan for Grade D was changed to an addition of 3 yuan. For Grade 2, the original addition of 1 yuan for Grade A was changed to an addition of 2 yuan, the original reduction of 1.2 jiao for Grade C was changed to a reduction of 1.5 jiao, and the original reduction of 1.7 jiao for Grade B was changed to a reduction of 1.8 jiao. Grade 4 has no changes at all. The changed procedures, grades, and prices are excerpted below (for reference).</p>
<p>▲ Grade 1 New Price Original Price Grade A Add 10 Yuan Add 10 Yuan Grade B Add 6 Yuan Add 7 Yuan Grade C Add 4.5 Yuan Add 6 Yuan Grade D Add 3 Yuan Add 5 Yuan</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Cotton Yarn Review Committee convened an appraisal meeting on December 26th to serve as a substitute for the June 24th period for delivery. As a result, the 10-count and 16-count grades had no changes and were the same as the May period. However, the original reduction of 5 yuan for the 20-count Cai Feiji brand from the Pudong Hengda Factory was raised one level and changed to a reduction of 4 yuan. However, the 20-count Fugui from the Hengfeng Factory was reduced by another level, from an original reduction of 5 yuan to a reduction of 6 yuan. There were no changes to the other yarn brands.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was firm and rising. Each month rose by 4 to 10 points. Afterwards, the Liverpool and Bombay telegrams were good. Liverpool brokers, colleagues, and spot traders bought in, and the market was even better. In the middle of the session, due to the approaching New Year holiday, long positions were closed and southern sales were set, and a slight return wind was seen. However, the wheat market and stocks both rose, and were eventually driven up. The spot basis was firm, and demand was flat. The closing was tight and stable. (Hays estimate, the plant uses 216,000 bales, Liverpool storage is 289,000 bales.) The spot price rose by 10 points, and the futures price rose by 8 to 14 points. Both the British cotton futures and spot prices rose by 4 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to short covering and buying by futures traders, but later weakened due to selling by European exporters and brokers. Pirgo rose by 3.25 rupees, Aumla rose by 5.25 rupees, and Balochi rose by 4.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 28th).</p>

<p>A New York telegram on December 28th reported the cotton market situation for the week, stating that the cotton market was relatively quiet due to Christmas. Domestic commercial news was good, and the foreign cotton market had been firm recently, so there was some price-fixing and retail buying. However, some people set up sales and closed long positions, which led to the curtailment of the rising trend. With the New Year approaching, the future of the cotton industry is now optimistic, and the saying that foreign cotton competition is gradually decreasing has aroused hopes for increased US cotton exports. However, there are several obstacles to the increase, one of which is that the authorities' cotton production procedures for next year are still doubtful, the second is that the 12-cent loan may not have a fixed price force, and the third is that the 1.7 million bales of cotton stored by the cotton farmers' public storage agency may be gradually sold when the market price is slightly higher than the loan price. It is speculated that the authorities will take into account the general business situation and slightly increase next year's sales, and will also pay more attention to the foreign market for US cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Grain, Downriver Rice Sales Sluggish, Seen Falling <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for each group were relatively scarce, with only a dozen or so arriving (goods totaling nearly 3,000 shi), while the sales market was particularly sluggish due to year-end and monetary issues. Later, due to the sunny weather, people's hearts were still soft, resulting in a quiet situation and the market color suddenly turned downward. For example, the prices of each thick japonica rice returned to several fen to a jiao, while although there were customers moving in late rice, the result was only a few hundred bales handled by the Tongzhou group, which did not help the overall situation and presented the same scene. The various colors of Du Yang tip and yinbian yuan also fell by more than a chi.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 34 or 35 sources from downriver and inland areas. In terms of market sales, the appetite for white japonica rice was slightly exchanged, and the retail appetite was still attractive in the morning market, but turned sluggish in the afternoon market. Early thin rice was carefully selected for high prices, yinbian yuan was normal, and Yang Du tip arrivals were slightly available, but sales were also slow. The port customer tip inquiries were still good. The market formed a stable situation for high-priced white japonica rice, and secondary goods were slightly weak by a few fen. Early thin rice was standing firm, and the prices of yinbian yuan and Yang Du port customers were set. Recently, the appetite for clearing stomachs has been sluggish, due to tight credit and high interest rates, buyers have no intention to trade.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Foreign Imported Xian Rice Suspended Trading Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>▲ Not Many Transactions in the Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign imported xian rice was due to the end of the Gregorian year, and many local customers were watching and doing nothing. Furthermore, because the executive committee was elected by the guild yesterday afternoon, the market was closed for half a day, and miscellaneous grains and foreign imported xian rice were all suspended from trading. In the morning, the transactions in the South City were also light, with only 409 bales of sales of Kai Xiang rice, 300 bales of Shashi rice, 200 bales of Siam machine rice, 600 bales of broken rice, and 300 bales of Saigon No. 1. Also, 400 bales of Saigon were ready to be loaded, and the return cargo of Saigon ready to be loaded opened at 4.977 yuan, and the foreign firm sold it for 4.94 yuan, which was all taken by the local hanging order. The selling prices of other rice were similar to the previous market, but people's hearts were in the process of looking good.</p>

<h3 id="e269">North and South Goods: Inexpensive and High-Quality Hunan Lotus Seeds <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds are a common nourishing food, with a fresh and fragrant aroma, quite different from ordinary ones. Stewing them until soft and adding rock sugar makes for a very pleasant snack. Although this year's production is not particularly abundant, market prices are extremely low, deserving of the reputation for being both inexpensive and of high quality. In the Shanghai market, Guangbang [a merchant group] directly manages production areas, which has long lacked vitality. Currently, top-grade Xiangtan lotus seeds are priced as high as thirty-two yuan. Both those inside and outside the industry are uniformly purchasing them, considering the price is only one-third of the peak price. As for risk, it seems limited. It can be stored for a long time during the winter season without spoiling. In Hankou, the price for high-quality lotus seeds is around twenty-eight yuan, while ordinary ones range from twenty-six to twenty-seven yuan, with slight variations. Few are willing to sell at these prices, and the market's sluggishness is unavoidable. The current prices for various grades in the market are listed below for reference:</p>

<p>Ping-Shui Gunpowder Tea Shows Slight Improvement in Sales to America</p>
<p>Zhejiang's Ping-Shui green tea has been stagnant in sales for a long time. Recently, with the New Year approaching, European firms are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, making the market situation even more desolate. Yesterday, British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Dent &amp; Co., and the Allied Trading Company purchased over 500 chests of "Xia Mu Ma Zhu" [small, round gunpowder tea] green tea after receiving telegrams from American firms. The market price has dropped by two to three yuan compared to before. There have been no large transactions for "Zhen Mei" [precious eyebrow] or "Zhen Mei" [needle eyebrow] tea. Although there are scattered sales of "Gong Xi" tea from stores and firms, the inventory is quite large, and the market trend is declining. However, there is news that the Russian Assistance Association will start operating next week. It is still difficult to determine the volume of sales.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Mild Trend in Hardware and Pig Lead <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: The pig lead market has been rather quiet recently because factories and merchants who actually use lead are halting purchases due to tight cash flow. However, the supply is not extensive, and inventories are low, so the standard price remains stable. Negotiations for spring sales are underway, but the volume of transactions will likely be less lively than in previous years due to high silver exchange rates.</p>
<p>▲ American Lead: There have not been many transactions recently, but sporadic buying and selling are still active. Yesterday and the day before, the market saw two to three hundred ingots being opened, but no large-scale business has been initiated. The price remains at fifteen yuan and two and a half jiao [cents] per dan [a unit of weight, about 50 kg] (using the Tael scale). The Commercial Press, Hua Feng Type Foundry, foundries, and machinery factories are replenishing their stocks. However, paint companies, litharge factories, and merchants from Tianjin and Hankou show no interest in purchasing.</p>
<p>▲ Hunan Lead: Currently, the arrival of goods is not substantial, and market inventory is low, so prices are favorable. However, due to the sluggishness of American lead, the Hunan lead market has to follow suit with a mild trend. The current market price is estimated at fourteen yuan and eight jiao per dan. Some transactions are occurring among merchants in the Hongkou area, and Ningbo merchants are also showing slight interest, resulting in relatively good small-scale transactions. Several tea merchants are in negotiations for goods to be used in the spring, and it is said that over four hundred dan have already been transacted, with the price at fourteen yuan and six and a half jiao per dan, which is significantly less than in previous years.</p>

<h3 id="e283">What Should Be Done During the New Year Holiday? <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Dear children, the New Year is coming soon, and your schools will have a holiday, right? Perhaps you are all preparing beautiful clothes, calling for fresh and sweet candies, and searching for various entertainments to pass this great time? However, I believe that this is not right!</p>
<p>Then what should be done? You must know that precious time is fleeting, and once it is gone, no amount of gold can buy back an inch or a fraction of it! Therefore, during this New Year holiday, you should still study. Although you don't have to go to school during the holiday, you should review all the lessons taught by your teachers throughout the year, as well as writing compositions and practicing calligraphy. If you have any questions, you can bring them up and ask your older siblings. In the morning and evening each day, find suitable exercises to ensure that your studies are not neglected and your bodies become healthier.</p>
<p>The ancients used to say, "Learning and career are like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat." I hope that younger brothers and sisters will follow this as a guiding principle and strive for continuous improvement in knowledge, making sure that your studies do not regress!</p>
<h3 id="e284">What Kind of Person Was Mr. Cai Songpo? <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Dingyi</p>
<p>As soon as December 25th arrives, I remember Mr. Cai Songpo, this martyr.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of the Republic (1915), Yuan Shikai instigated Yang Du and others to establish the Preparatory Society for Peace, sending telegrams to all provinces advocating the imperial system. He also fabricated public opinion and wrote letters of urging. He openly established the Grand Ceremony Preparatory Office, changing the following year to the first year of the Hongxian era. On December 25th of that year, Mr. Cai Songpo, in conjunction with various important figures, sent a telegram from Yunnan to Yuan Shikai, demanding that he abolish the imperial system and abdicate immediately within twenty-four hours. Later, this day was designated as the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day.</p>
<p>In January of the fifth year of the Republic (1916), although Yuan Shikai still declared the imperial system and changed the era name to Hongxian, seeing that various provinces had successively declared independence and unanimously condemned Yuan, he immediately abolished the imperial system. By May, he died of depression and disappointment. Mr. Cai also, due to excessive labor during the period of resisting Yuan, went to Japan for medical treatment after the event was settled, but his condition deteriorated until November 28th, when the treatment proved ineffective, and Mr. Cai passed away, abandoning the Republic of China, which he had helped to rebuild.</p>
<p>Finally, let me summarize what kind of person Mr. Cai actually was.</p>
<p>He was a model student. Why? Mr. Cai Songpo lost his father at a young age, and his family was very poor, but he was able to encourage himself, study diligently, and comfort his mother. He spent his life in a state of working and studying. In Japan, he went through various struggles and finally completed his studies and returned to China. In this light, isn't he a model student?</p>
<p>He was a model soldier. Why? During his tenure as governor of Yunnan, Mr. Cai Songpo did not disturb the people, did not interfere in politics, was loyal, and handled matters with strictness. He did not accept humiliation, resisted the imperial system, and was willing to sacrifice his life. After the event, he did not take credit. In this light, isn't he a model soldier?</p>
<p>He was a model citizen. Why? Mr. Cai Songpo protected the country and loved the people, risked his life, and only knew justice, not fearing the powerful. In this light, isn't he a model citizen?</p>
<h3 id="e285">Air <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Air is truly a strange thing. It is invisible and untouchable, so how do we know that there is air in the sky?</p>
<p>Take a short glass and invert it in a basin of water. No matter how deep you push the glass down, the water will not rise to the bottom of the glass. If you tilt the glass, bubbles will be released from the glass, and the water level will gradually rise. From this experiment, it can be proven that air, like other substances, also occupies space. Air floats on the surface of the earth, just like water flows in rivers and seas. However, air is thinner than water, so the existence of air is not as obvious as that of water.</p>
<p>Air is not a simple substance. It contains oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and five rare gases: argon, helium, neon, krypton, and xenon. These nine gases all have their properties and uses.</p>
<p>Oxygen is heavier than air. It easily combines directly with various metals, like rust, and can support combustion. Its use is to provide people with breathing. Miners and explorers, in the seabed or in mines where there is no oxygen, must bring in oxygen in order not to die.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is lighter than air. It does not combine with various substances and must be at high temperatures and specific temperatures to combine with other substances. Its use is to fill light bulbs because there will inevitably be oxygen present in the light bulbs, so nitrogen is introduced to expel the oxygen. It is also used to manufacture fertilizers.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide is heavier than air. Water vapor condenses into water when it encounters cold.</p>
<p>The five rare gases: Argon: does not combine with other substances. Some light bulbs contain argon, which are called argon bulbs. Helium: The gas bag in airships is this gas. Neon: Used in nighttime billboards, the various colors are very eye-catching, and this gas is commonly known as neon. Krypton and Xenon: No one has yet invented their uses. Children, study hard now and invent the uses of krypton and xenon in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e286">Making Beautiful New Year's Cards Yourself <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Qianheng</p>
<p>Children! The New Year that you have been looking forward to is coming soon. Of course, everyone will inevitably be busy during this New Year – giving New Year's cards. But buying New Year's cards to give away is too uneconomical. Haven't you all learned "Crafts" and "Art" at school?</p>
<p>Here, let's use them to make an inexpensive and beautiful New Year's card!</p>
<p>Materials: 100-pound drawing paper, watercolor paints, pith paper (available in Chinese pharmacies)</p>
<p>Method: First, print the pattern you like or love on pith paper, then color it according to the pattern. Because the color is on pith paper, it is convex, making it look more lively and beautiful. Then cut it out and paste it in the appropriate place on the drawing paper, and then color the drawing paper.</p>
<p>Note: 1. The shape of the drawing paper is not fixed. Rectangular, round, star-shaped, polygonal, etc., are all acceptable. But don't make it too big, because if it is too big, it will look crude. 2. The position of the pasting should also be appropriate and beautiful, leaving a considerable blank space to write names and phrases. But all of these have to be arranged according to your personal intelligence.</p>

<p>— Shendinghe</p>
<p>Luo Zhen got up and first wished his grandparents a happy New Year, then wished his father a happy New Year. His father hugged Luo Zhen on his lap.</p>
<p>"Dad, I want your New Year's gift."</p>
<p>His father nodded and said, "Yes," then put Luo Zhen down and walked to his desk, taking out a red paper envelope from the drawer.</p>
<p>"Zhen, this is my New Year's gift for you this year."</p>
<p>Luo Zhen took the red envelope and hurriedly opened it to see. He thought there must be two silver dollars inside, but when he opened it, it was a blank piece of paper with a map of the Republic of China being蚕食 drawn on it, and a few lines of poetry written on it:</p>
<p>"Happy New Year, Happy New Year,</p>
<p>Change into new clothes, wear new hats,</p>
<p>Who has ever remembered the national humiliation firmly.</p>
<p>From this year on, I hope you wake up!</p>
<p>Cast off your past timidity and laziness,</p>
<p>From today on, struggle and strive to run forward."</p>
<p>After reading it, Luo Zhen couldn't help but feel enlightened, and hot tears rolled down. He hugged his father and said, "I'm awake, I'm awake, from now on I will struggle and strive!"</p>
<h3 id="e289">New Method of Making New Year's Cards <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Hansheng</p>
<p>The New Year is coming soon! How happy!</p>
<p>When celebrating the New Year, we always have to prepare New Year's cards to send to our friends. I think you will definitely go to the bookstore to buy some very beautiful New Year's cards, and you may not be very happy to make a few yourself and send them to your good friends. In fact, things you make yourself are only better than those you buy, and when your friends receive the homemade New Year's cards you send, they will definitely make some and send them to you. In this way, can't everyone practice handicrafts?</p>
<p>Here I have written down the methods of making several new types of New Year's cards below:</p>
<p>(1) This is an airplane New Year's card. Use cardboard to cut out three pieces, A, B, and C, according to the diagram (the size is determined by yourself according to the proportion); then punch a small hole at point D and use a piece of thread to tie the New Year's greeting card to it. At the black lines, cut with scissors. When sending it to others, you can not have it assembled, let them assemble it themselves after receiving it. It is best if the cardboard is colored; otherwise, paste colored paper on colorless paper, and the color should be simple. The meaning of this New Year's card is "Aviation Saves the Country," and it wishes them (or her) progress as fast as an airplane.</p>
<p>(2) This is a clock-style New Year's card, which means that time is precious and should not be wasted. Cut a shape like a clock according to diagram A. If you want the hands to move, add two tacks. Add a piece of cardboard on the back and glue it to hold, so that the clock can stand.</p>
<p>(3) This is a locomotive New Year's card, which also expresses the meaning of congratulating friends on their progress. Cut out two pieces according to diagram A, and then apply glue according to the instructions in the diagram to combine the two pieces. Paste transparent paper on the windows. Do not apply glue to point E. Make another New Year's greeting card and place it inside, which can be pulled out and read. The colors should be more beautiful as described in the instructions.</p>
<p>(4) This is a plum blossom New Year's card. Plum blossoms are our national flower and bloom in winter. Cut a plum blossom shape according to diagram A and punch a small hole at point F. In addition, cut out five pieces of each item in diagram B, apply color, and then use thread to attach one piece to each hole at point F.</p>
<p>The above are the methods of making four new types of New Year's cards that I have told you. If you children can read my methods and invent many better ones yourselves, that is what I hope most.</p>

<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>My sister has a daughter named Tier.</p>
<p>I remember when I went to Tianjin to visit my sister, Tier was still in swaddling clothes and couldn't speak yet. Every time I held her in my arms, her two jet-black eyes would always glance at my face. In order to preserve her lively appearance, I had taken several photos of her. Soon after, I left them.</p>
<p>This year, my sister came to Shanghai, and I almost didn't recognize Tier! Because she can now walk, run, and talk. She can also cut paper, cutting out various patterns, including cats, fish, people, utensils, and houses, all of which are very lifelike. I admired that this five-year-old child already had very good art.</p>
<p>I showed her the photos I had taken of her before and said, "This is you." But she shook her little hand and said, "No! No! Look how big I am now."</p>
<p>I sang and danced, and she listened and watched attentively. Soon, she would take two handkerchiefs as wings and learn to "fly like a butterfly."</p>
<p>My sister stayed in Shanghai for a month and then took Tier back to her hometown. Since then, I have not seen her apple-like face and pleasing appearance. Recently, I received a letter from my sister saying, "Tier often calls you 'dancing uncle,' and she hopes you will come home."</p>

<p>Children! When you see the tongue twisters above, you feel that these simple words are very easy to remember. Is that right?</p>
<p>Now I'll just have you read it once, you have to read it smoothly and quickly, without interruption. I believe that you will still stutter and not be able to read it smoothly, or mispronounce the words completely!</p>
<p>At this time, you will fail and then realize its difficulty. (Ya)</p>

<p>Children, we haven't seen each other for another week. Today, I will tell you some interesting things about birds. I think children will definitely like it!</p>
<p>(1) Birds that are like Tailors</p>
<p>There is a kind of small bird, about the same size as a sparrow. But don't underestimate its short body, its means of building nests are very clever. It draws silk from the silkworms in the wild. Using its beak as a needle, it sews several large leaves together. In this way, its nest is created.</p>
<p>(2) The Crocodile's Toothpick</p>
<p>The ferocious crocodile has a good friend, who is the屑索bird. When the crocodile's enemies come, it makes strange sounds, calling on its friends to escape from them. After the crocodile has eaten its fill, there are always remnants of food stuck in its teeth, which makes it feel very uncomfortable. It opens its mouth wide and waits for the屑索bird to pick out the food. The 屑索bird eats the food to fill its hunger. Children, isn't this very much like the crocodile's toothpick?</p>
<h3 id="e294">Correction Regarding "Famous Continents and Oceans on Earth" <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>In the December 2nd issue of this publication, an article entitled "Famous Continents and Oceans on Earth" was written by someone with the pen name Ku. Mr. Ku said that in the past, textbooks divided the world into five continents: Asia, Europe, America, Africa, and Oceania; and five oceans: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Antarctic Ocean. He said that this was incorrect and that it should be divided into six continents and four oceans. The six continents are: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania. The four oceans are: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. In fact, what he said is still incorrect.</p>
<p>The correct definition should be seven continents and four oceans.</p>
<p>The seven continents are: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Oceania (i.e., the Oceanic continent), and Antarctica.</p>
<p>The four oceans are: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>The determination of six continents and four oceans also has a considerable history, and it is necessary to describe it here. Now let's look at the explanation below!</p>
<p>The earliest division was indeed five continents and five oceans. However, since 1911, as a result of the exploration of Antarctica by the Norwegian Amundsen et al., it was confirmed that Antarctica was just a landlocked continent covered in solid ice, not an ocean. From then on, it was named Antarctica. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Ministry of Education also issued an order explaining and confirming the seven continents and four oceans.</p>
<p>This year, in November, U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Byrd's Antarctic expedition used wireless radio to report (see Shen Bao, November 20th and 25th) that Antarctica is not only not an ocean, nor a cluster of islands (as some people claimed), but a vast continent of 20 square miles. Therefore, the addition of Antarctica is certain.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Mr. Science Performs Magic Tricks <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Hegongchao</p>
<p>Let's Generate Electricity</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Science brought a kitten and a stick of sealing wax (the sealing wax used to seal the mouths of letters) that was about the length of a cigar onto the stage. It's so cold today. A red-hot electric furnace was placed on the left side of the stage, filling the stage with warmth.</p>
<p>Mr. Science said, "Today we are going to generate electricity. You must think it's strange. Electricity only exists in the sky in summer. How can we generate electricity? But you must know that everything contains electricity. Let's first take this sealing wax stick and try it out."</p>
<p>Mr. Science took out a piece of flannel from his pocket and rubbed it vigorously and quickly on the sealing wax stick. After rubbing it for a while, he immediately called a child to come to the stage and put the heated end of the sealing wax stick to the child's hair. A few strands of hair were attracted up and stuck to the sealing wax stick. After a while, they fell down one by one.</p>
<p>"The sealing wax stick also contains electricity. After I rub it hard, it will heat up, and heating up is a phenomenon of generating electricity. The amount of electricity generated by friction is very small and can only attract extremely light things like hair and paper scraps.</p>
<p>"Let's try this cat again," Mr. Science said, leading the cat to the electric furnace and heating it for a while, so that its body was warm. Then he led it to the center of the stage and rubbed it very quickly on the cat's fur. The cat's fur stood on end and made a very light "creaking" sound. At the same time, Mr. Science asked someone to turn off the lights, and the stage and audience immediately became dark. Then they saw brilliant sparks emitting from the cat's fur.</p>
<p>"This proves that the cat also has electricity in its body. When you want to play these two sets of electric tricks, if you don't have a sealing wax stick, then a fountain pen or an imitation ivory comb can be used. If you don't have flannel, then wool can be used. But when playing, the drier the things you use, the better, and the air must also be dry. It is easy to succeed in playing in this winter. When rubbing, you must use force and be quick.</p>

<p>The tools for the experiment! One cat. One sealing wax stick. One piece of flannel.</p>

<p>— Zi</p>
<p>The years of the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934), with the wheel of time of panic and turmoil, quietly passed away.</p>
<p>On this New Year's Eve, everyone can't help but think forward and backward!</p>
<p>I dare not ask about national matters, and I disdain to talk about personal trifles. As a woman, I am more concerned about women's affairs, and I will summarize the women's affairs of this year:</p>
<p>This year, the women's world was particularly honored to be appointed as special commissioners for promoting domestic products. However, unwelcome news came frequently. The import of foreign goods increased throughout the year. As a result, the public felt resentful and criticized women for not being ambitious. But actually, by understanding the world economy and observing the domestic situation, we know that the external pressure is great and the internal resistance is 奥. The occurrence of this phenomenon is also inevitable. It is unfair to place this difficult task on women who are scattered and under great pressure.</p>
<p>In March and April, Nanchang mobilized the New Life Movement, and there was an order prohibiting women from wearing strange clothes. However, in large cities, fashionable expressions were prevailing, with bare breasts and fluttering dresses. In poor rural areas, there were also noble women with elaborate clothing. There was a great tendency for those who prohibit to prohibit themselves, and those who promote to promote themselves.</p>
<p>Since "Germany" and "Italy" shouted out the slogan "Women Go Home," China has also re-advocated the education of good wives and mothers. However, on the one hand, due to the bankruptcy of the countryside and the depression of the cities, a large number of women abandoned their homes and fled, but they had the regret of not being able to return!</p>
<p>Revival is a new trick this year. With the flames of revival, the concept of chastity has been re-promoted and rewarded. This is a major setback in the voice of women's liberation!</p>
<p>Secondly, with the overall economic panic, human feelings suddenly changed, and women's suicides were often heard. This is another shocking fact.</p>
<p>The above are all a record of this year's women's affairs, which can also be regarded as women's fleeting fortune!</p>
<p>What is barely satisfactory is the success of the suffrage movement, but this remains to be seen whether the facts can be used.</p>
<p>Next year is said to be the year of the child. During the year of the child, the problem of child-rearing must be solved! Everyone knows that without solving the problem of child-rearing, women will not get true liberation, so on the eve of the upcoming year of the child, I have deep hope!</p>
<h3 id="e298">Summary of the Women's National Products Year <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>The year of the Republic of China's 23rd year, designated as the Women's National Products Year, has slipped away like an arrow!</p>
<p>Following the "September 18th Incident," a wave of boycotts against Japanese goods surged across the nation. For a time, Japanese trade with China declined, and Japanese capital felt threatened. On one hand, Japan used dumping tactics to counter the anti-Japanese movement. On the other hand, unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, willingly acted as accomplices, substituting Japanese goods with fake trademarks to evade inspection and punishment, selling and transporting them in secret during the height of the boycott. As a result, North and Southwest China, without large-scale boycotts, remained full of cheap and attractive Japanese products. Unfortunately, the boycott not only intensified the sales of British goods at the time, revealing the inherent flaws of the movement but also gradually faded after the 22nd year due to various pressures. In its place arose the "National Products Year," advocating the use of domestic goods under the slogan of "increasing domestic production."</p>
<p>National industrialists and entrepreneurs declared, "To put domestic goods on the path of increased production, reduce the surplus of foreign goods, and curb the sales of Japanese goods through the enthusiastic support of women, it may be possible to make unscrupulous merchants, driven by conscience, abandon their actions that harm national interests." In other words, the so-called Women's National Products Year was an attempt by national industrialists and entrepreneurs, with the encouragement and assistance of the government, to promote the development and stimulation of their capital through this slogan.</p>
<p>Thus, the 23rd year of the Republic of China was designated as the "Women's National Products Year."</p>
<p>National product exhibitions were held in various cities across the country, from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Changsha, Xi'an, and fashion shows were performed in several places in Shanghai and Nanjing, decorating the year with all kinds of dazzling activities. But what was the result of the Women's National Products Year? Perhaps the pockets of individual industrialists and merchants were slightly fuller? But did the entire national industry "put domestic goods on the path of increased production, reduce the surplus of foreign goods, and curb the sales of Japanese goods"? According to customs statistics, from January to October of this year, our national foreign trade deficit was over 430 million yuan. Meanwhile, the yarn and rubber industries are in danger, and recently flour mills have also reduced production (中华日报, December 3rd). Newspaper reports of Japanese goods dumping are filled with alarming news of increased dumping.</p>
<p>Naturally, this situation cannot be remedied by simply "promoting national products," nor is it merely the result of a "five-minute craze" that has subsided. In essence, in China, which is dominated by imperialist economic forces, it is almost impossible to develop national capital. Since the gradual stabilization of various imperialist powers after the European War, they have re-concentrated capital and intensified their efforts in China. The increasing decline of China's most important industry—the textile industry—is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>The characteristics of China's economy are two-fold: on one hand, the restraint of imperialist economy, and on the other hand, the shackles of feudal forces. Imperialism and China's feudal forces collude and support each other, forming two powerful forces that attack from both sides. China's national industries cannot withstand the competition of imperialism or the devastation of feudal remnants. China's national industry not only cannot expand reproduction, but it cannot even recover simple reproduction, resulting in the decline of industrial production and agriculture. In addition, droughts, floods, and the more or less political fragmentation caused by local warlords, numerous overlapping taxes, chaotic currency systems and huge differences in domestic exchange rates, the lack of uniform standards of weights and measures, and nominal tariff systems all contribute to the fact that China's industries not only cannot develop but are shrinking and even bankrupt.</p>
<p>First, consider from the perspective of production: Heavy industry is the foundation of a modern country, and 90% of China's coal and iron are enterprises of British and Japanese capital. As for China's light industry, the textile industry, known as the king of industries, is experiencing closures, shutdowns, reduced production, and inventory problems. Firstly, Chinese capital and technology are woefully inadequate. The majority of foreign-owned yarn mills in China are Japanese, and the strength of Japanese capital and technological improvements are enough to drag Chinese yarn mills into the waves of decline. In terms of management methods, Japanese mills operate day and night, with a consistent number of spindles running, maintaining balance. Even under the same conditions, with the same number of spindles, Japanese mills produce more than Chinese mills. Chinese yarn mills, on the other hand, have more fixed capital but insufficient circulating capital, stockpiled raw cotton, production restrictions, and backward technology, leaving them with no choice but to close down, shut down, or reduce production. In particular, foreign capital is abundant, and the actual control is entirely in the hands of foreigners. The Chinese production sector is mixed with a lot of foreign capital, and yarn mills use foreign cotton, flour mills use foreign wheat, etc., trapping Chinese production in a semi-colonial dependency, making development impossible. In addition, the lack of tariff autonomy allows foreign goods to flood in like a tide. At the same time, foreign factories in China are not only exempt from import duties on their products, but foreigners also enjoy the benefits of the Three-Link Certificate when purchasing local goods in the interior, which exempts them from levies and taxes along the way, while Chinese merchants do not. Moreover, Chinese merchants purchase foreign cotton through the hands of foreigners, resulting in yet another layer of exploitation. Naturally, the production cost of foreign goods is lower than that of Chinese goods. Therefore, under these favorable conditions, foreign goods are dumped at low prices, while Chinese national industrial production is permanently mired in a declining state.</p>
<p>Secondly, consider from the perspective of the market: China does not have a unified market. On the basis of a divided economic foundation, coupled with the special interests of various imperialist powers, a situation of market division has been created in China. In Guangdong, in April, the southwest authorities passed a three-year industrial construction plan, implementing exclusive sales of products such as sugar and cement, and promulgated thirteen articles of tariff rules for collecting protective taxes on goods imported from outside the province, with the tax rate reaching as high as 50%. The leader of Hunan, in the name of maintaining the provincial first yarn factory, adopted the method of market blockade, set up a cotton management office, and restricted the import of cotton yarn produced by yarn mills in Shanghai and Wuhan into the province. Shanxi has recently implemented a ban on the import of matches from other provinces. The conclusion of these facts is that localism and protectionist forces, following the economic interests of various imperialist powers, are leading to the segmentation of the domestic market; balancing a province's trade deficit by dividing the market is also an attempt to eliminate the increasingly expanding financial crisis; this is precisely the will of imperialism. The intensification of the capital war of various imperialist powers in China increasingly demands the delineation of specific spheres of influence, and the loss of Northeast China is a clear indication of the beginning of the carve-up. In this way, the entire structure of the national economy is becoming more backward and declining, and national industries can only decline.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, promoting domestic goods purely from the standpoint of boycotting Japanese goods is active. But from the perspective of the development of the Chinese economy, this function becomes very passive. Obviously, it is impossible for China's declining and fragmented national industry to save itself from its doom merely by promoting domestic goods or by relying on the weak stimulation of the Women's National Products Year. In reality, it is a kind of weak illusion.</p>
<p>Who are the supporters of the Women's National Products Year? They are high-class and middle-class women. These people have more purchasing power among women. However, their enthusiasm is only for Europeanization, modernity, and decoration, so their purchasing power does not increase the productivity of domestic goods. Facts prove that the import of cosmetics and toys in the first ten months of this year reached more than three million yuan, which broke all historical records. And for the women of the lower classes, unemployment, hunger, and bankruptcy are their relationship and response to the Women's National Products Year.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is inevitable that this year's Women's National Products Year will not be very effective. Nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<h3 id="e299">A Self-Description by a "Social Person" <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhishan</p>
<p>The Lessons Given to Me by Family, School, and Society</p>
<p>Although my family is a "scholarly family for generations," and my grandfather and father were influential gentlemen in the entire village and within dozens of miles, we were completely in the working class in terms of living standards because of poverty. My late mother was an old-fashioned woman with both talent and virtue, but in life, she was so poor that she needed to spin and weave to earn a few strings of cash to buy food to avoid starvation. How could a little girl in such an environment reach her current state? Let me describe it below:</p>
<p>How I Got the Opportunity to Study</p>
<p>How did I get the opportunity to study? (1) My father was a scholar with rich thoughts and far-sighted vision, and his philosophy was to always take the "lead in everything." (2) After my only younger brother died, my parents had no sons, so they wanted to cultivate a daughter. (3) I declared to my parents that if they allowed me to go to Tianjin to study, I would definitely be able to bear the responsibility of a son in supporting them. So my father immediately sold the only ten acres of land to provide me with funds to go to Tianjin Normal School to study. This was in the second year of the Republic of China. At that time, the atmosphere in the north was still very closed, and I was the only woman in Yanshan County to study outside.</p>
<p>The Influence of School on Me</p>
<p>Since I overcame all kinds of difficulties to get the opportunity to study, I naturally worked hard desperately. When I first arrived at school, I didn't understand anything, and everyone laughed at me as a country bumpkin. But in the second semester, I became the representative figure of my class. At the first debate held by the school, even though I was in the lowest grade, I was assigned as one of the debaters. At the moment when the judges calculated the scores at the end of the debate, I automatically ran to the stage to give a speech to the whole school on the benefits of the debate and encourage the students to participate enthusiastically. It was this that I encountered a major setback: the principal immediately announced to the public that I did not understand the rules, and before taking the stage, I had to ask the chairman for permission to speak, and I could only speak after the chairman allowed it. Alas! As a child who had just come out of the countryside, and with no training in gatherings at school, how could I understand? Being hit by this big nail in public gave me too much of a blow. From then on, until graduation, I never participated in any school activities. Thinking about it now, this had a great impact on my ability to train. However, I was able to obtain relatively rich scientific knowledge in school, which provided a foundation for my further study. So this stage of life is worth mentioning here in particular.</p>
<p>Teaching and Participating in the "May Fourth" Movement</p>
<p>After studying at the normal school for five years, I graduated in the summer of the seventh year of the Republic of China and was assigned to teach at the attached primary school. At that time, the highest salary for primary school teachers was 30 yuan per month, but in order to actually bear the responsibility of supporting my parents, I also worked as a tutor in a family and taught courses at other schools, so I actually had an income of more than 50 yuan per month. My private life was also very thrifty. Apart from three yuan for food and three yuan for pocket money, I gave all the money to my father. An income of 40 to 50 yuan per month in the countryside was really amazing, so everyone was willing to send their daughters to school, and the atmosphere was refreshed. Until now, I am still bearing the responsibility of a son in supporting my family.</p>
<p>At that time, my state of mind was extremely happy. A daughter could also be a son, and I won a breath for women. Although my body and mind were tired, my spirit was happy. In order to fulfill the responsibility of a son to my parents, and because I was afraid of being a daughter-in-law—the life of a daughter-in-law in the north is the most bitter, and I had personally seen my late mother suffer all kinds of bad treatment to the point of death—I vowed not to marry. I planned to remain single for the rest of my life and serve in the education field, believing that it was the most appropriate plan for the country, for the family, and for myself.</p>
<p>In May of the eighth year of the Republic of China, the "May Fourth" Movement broke out. Stimulated by my own strong heart and the desire to compete with men, I organized the Tianjin Women's Patriotic Association with classmates from my alma mater, which was the beginning of my participation in social movements. In the process of being in charge of the work of the Patriotic Association, I still encountered some difficulties as when I first arrived at school from the countryside, and I understood how to deal with society and how to lead the masses. Ah! The "May Fourth" Movement taught me too much: it liberated my thinking, broadened my horizons, and made me dissatisfied with the current society. I wanted to create a new life, and simply sticking to the industry was not a perfect life, and I needed to create a career. Single life is against nature, and marriage can still support parents, and I don't have to be a daughter-in-law under my in-laws. So my view of life changed: I regard the occupation as a need for material life, the cause as a sustenance for spiritual life, and marriage as something that should have the spirit of singleness, but not the reality of singleness. The scope of occupation is naturally not limited to primary school teachers, and the scope of career is determined to be engaged in women's movement and patriotic movement for life.</p>
<p>Me in Career and Cause</p>
<p>I have been engaged in career life for seventeen years now. During this period, I have worked as a primary school teacher, a middle school dean, an editor for daily, biweekly, and monthly publications, and a staff member of a party official agency. Among them, the life of a party official was the most bitter. When I was a member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Executive Committee in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I experienced many factional disputes within the party and some base and disgusting things that turned friends into enemy parties, which are unbearable to recall. Therefore, I felt that I was the least suitable for political life. Among them, the job of editor was the most interesting to me, because what I edited were women's publications, and there was also a component of cause in it.</p>
<p>In terms of career, since the "May Fourth" Movement, I have been engaged in patriotic movements and have published Tianjin Women's Daily, organized the Female Star Society, published the Female Star Biweekly, and founded the Female Star Women's Remedial School with female comrades who were full of revolutionary consciousness. Since the success of the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang, I have repeatedly awakened women's ideology organizations in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, promoting the success of the national revolution on the one hand, and realizing the equality of men and women's rights on the other hand. I am really ashamed that I have not achieved anything so far! Among the careers I have participated in, only one type of Women's Resonance Monthly still exists, but what kind of help does this give to the actual career? Because I feel the poverty of spiritual life, this year I and my comrades in Beijing organized the Women's Cultural Promotion Association, seeking to unite with like-minded sisters, starting with solving the suffering of women themselves, and then expanding them into a powerful team of women's movement and national revolution.</p>
<p>Thoughts After Entering Society</p>
<p>Seventeen years after entering society, I feel that society is cold, selfish, and intolerant of Nora-style women. When a woman runs to society, she is bound by unequal etiquette and establishment forces in all aspects. People in society are most likely to slander women, and they are accustomed to slandering them with sexual relations. In this male society where no one is a government official, if a woman is promoted because of the promotion of a superior, the words of sexual slander will come out. Look, which of the women who are in higher positions now has not been slandered? This shows the lack of sincerity of society towards women. From the Xinhai Revolution to the present, women have received the sincere support of men in about three periods: namely, the three revolutionary tense periods of the Xinhai Revolution, the "May Fourth" Movement, and the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army. As soon as the revolutionary atmosphere slackens, the concept of playing with women arises, and even various sets of circles are set up to deceive women, and after women enter the circle, they create a big reason for laughter and slander to punish them. Apart from the above three periods, women who have entered society can be said to be struggling in the dark under the heavy clouds every day. I am also a young general in this struggling group.</p>
<p>December 25th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China at the Women's Resonance Society</p>
<h3 id="e300">From the Appointment of the Fourth Legislative Yuan Members to the Women's Movement <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Yi</p>
<p>On the 26th of this month, the Central Political Committee appointed 86 members of the fourth Legislative Yuan, of which 67 were re-elected from the third session. Neither of the original female legislators was re-elected, and two other people were appointed instead. The number of female legislators in previous sessions has not only not increased, but has also decreased by one compared to the first and second sessions.</p>
<p>Some people may think that this is a retreat of the women's movement, and that the women's participation in politics has been going on for so many years, and the results are only like this. In fact, this view is wrong.</p>
<p>If it is really believed that this is a retreat of the women's movement, then the women's movement is only a movement to push a few women onto the political stage, and not a movement to seek the liberation of the masses of women. In this China, where the poison of etiquette and teaching still exists, the economic power is completely in the hands of men, and all politics, education, and legislation are centered on men. Women are either playthings or slaves. Although capitalism has invaded, it has absorbed many women to participate in production and given some women the opportunity to obtain occupations. However, the shackles of women have not been reduced, and even the atmosphere of women returning to the family is becoming more and more intense. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to rely solely on a few female legislators appointed by the government to liberate the masses of women from top to bottom. Not to mention that it is difficult for only two or three female legislators to pass proposals, even if more women participate, if they are speaking on behalf of the masses, then men can also use various methods to suppress or exclude them in order to defend their own interests. Therefore, the real women's movement should be based on the majority of awakened women, unite rural women and housewives, and seek the thorough liberation of women from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Women's participation in politics is not absolutely useless. If women have strong groups and strong forces, they may be able to obtain some welfare by means of political power. Otherwise, participation in politics away from the masses has nothing to do with the entire women's movement except to improve personal status and position.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Santa Claus and the Women's National Products Year <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>My first understanding of Santa Claus was when I entered a church school at the age of thirteen and celebrated my first Christmas. I remember it was at two o'clock in the afternoon on December 25th, and as soon as the bell rang, everyone in the school swarmed into the gymnasium. I saw a costumed Western old man standing on the judging platform, wearing a red robe, with white hair and beard made entirely of cotton; according to old classmates, that was Santa Claus, who would give us Christmas presents.</p>
<p>Soon, sure enough, everyone in the school, from the principal to the janitor, received a red paper bag from the hands of this strange old man. Eager people opened the paper bag before returning to their seats. Some got foreign writing pads and a pencil, six Bs and seven Bs, and some got foreign stationery and envelopes, and some got foreign erasers and foreign penholders. Christmas comes to the world majestically every year, and Santa Claus brings gifts to everyone every year. But as time goes by, the gifts have also changed every year. Gradually, some classmates got a box of foreign face powder, and some got a long box of foreign talcum powder.</p>
<p>Just like not long ago, classmates had a deep love for foreign pencils, foreign stationery and envelopes, and foreign erasers and penholders, and scrambled to buy them out of their pockets, the big and small goblins had a deadly love for foreign face powder and talcum powder. Now, not only is the once-popular borneol talcum powder ignored, but even the face powder that was once considered indispensable, if anyone is still using it, everyone seems to have made a pact that they will regard that person as a bumpkin, as a country girl. Just at this moment, Santa Claus changed his tricks again. This time, he brought some colorful, brilliant glass bead necklaces. And for many years to come, the gifts have been changing every year, from foreign velvet ropes, foreign silk threads, and foreign clothing lace, to foreign wallets and foreign fake bracelets, and then to jeweled hairpins, brooches, and foreign fake gemstone rings. Then there was a big change in the world: wearing red gold necklaces, rings, and red gold brooches and bracelets is a bumpkin, is a country girl: the foundation of fashion is foreign jewelry again.</p>
<p>As time goes by, according to my calculations, the students of my alma mater, as well as the girls of various foreign schools across the country, have received the gift of foreign gifts from Santa Claus for nearly twenty years now. According to reports published in various newspapers, this year, which is the year of promoting national products the most, the total import of cosmetics, clothing, and foreign jewelry for women in our country has reached more than two million yuan. However, recently, many patriotic people, worried about the outflow of money, are already writing articles about sending women the National Products Year, wanting women not to regard the end of the Women's National Products Year as the end of their responsibilities, and should catch up quickly to recover our country's economic rights and interests. Not only that, some smart people actually pin this slim ray of hope on the Student National Products Year next year. I think this kind of hope will eventually be just hope. Don't you see, the puppets of the pioneers of various foreign goods—Santa Claus—their puppeteers are gradually multiplying there, one generation is more like one generation, they have passed from father to son, and son to grandson, and now they have reached the era of great-grandsons and great-great-grandsons. Its deep-rooted power can never be killed by a few words of "patriotism" "patriotism" and a few "what year" "what year." Everyone open their eyes and see more clearly!</p>
<h3 id="e302">Tianjin Women's World <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Tu</p>
<p>Tianjin, often called "Little Shanghai," indeed has a bit of a seaside feel. Its industry and commerce are central in North China, and it is, without a doubt, a transportation hub. Western-style buildings with large window openings stand tall, and cars speed along asphalt roads. Dance halls are filled with music and dancing all night long—these are all signs of a bustling metropolis.</p>
<p>Tianjin women, standing on the level playing field, are immersed in a competition of beauty and glamour—of course, this refers to a segment of the population. The so-called socialites and celebrities are keen on participating in various singing and dancing troupes. They sometimes have the honor of participating in naming or groundbreaking ceremonies, cutting ribbons and tossing champagne glasses amidst cheers, providing material for the illustrated magazines the next day. At times, the clever owners of department stores or domestic goods shops specially invite young ladies or wives from prominent families to model clothes, showcasing new silks or sweaters. The styles of these clothes leave ordinary people in a state of baffled bewilderment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are no dance bans or instructions prohibiting men and women from holding hands here. People have a considerable amount of freedom. Many dance enthusiasts from Beiping long for Tianjin's dance halls, where there are open dance hostesses and ten-story Western-style buildings, and all the facilities follow Shanghai's lead. In the music, people forget the sorrows of the world, and the faces with red lips or shiny hair are always smiling.</p>
<p>Many university girls are also working hard. The girls at Nankai University are always looked upon with a bit more respect, perhaps because of the school spirit and curriculum, but compared to the girls at Hebei Women's Normal School, they already have quite a bit of an aristocratic air. The pastimes that female students are into are ball games, ice skating, and swimming. A love of sports has almost become a universal hobby for female students in North China, unlike the girls in Jiangnan, who are much more fond of staying indoors. Speaking of entertainment, one cannot forget the gambling in Tianjin. In addition to cards and poker, there are also large roulette wheels and jai alai courts... and these venues feature wealthy wives and young concubines. Most of these bustling places are located in the concessions, and Tianjin has many concessions.</p>
<p>There are also quite a few women who are teachers and small office workers. They live a simple and stable life, and after having enough to eat and wear, going to the park or seeing a movie is considered an extra treat.</p>
<p>Tianjin's brothels exist both openly and secretly. Prostitutes who are also dancers are the ones who easily attract a large clientele. In the hidden brothels, there are cries stifled by life's pressures. On street corners or in playgrounds, they tug at men's sleeves, and laughter flies from their blackened eyes.</p>
<p>In the Chinese territory, women who are coolies or laborers can be seen building Western-style buildings, driving piles, or carrying mud and tiles, leaving their children to the side. The factory chimneys in Tianjin never stop, and some female workers have to run for several miles from their homes to the concessions. In "three-no-care" areas like the City God Temple, there are women selling sweets and toys all year round, and women performing Bengbeng opera. Tianjin women who love to sing the waterfront ballad waddle along, their bellies protruding.</p>
<p>Along the streets, there are seamstresses quietly sewing and mending, and, of course, there are always beggars constantly pleading.</p>
<p>Extreme revelry covers up the spreading misery, but in reality, it can't cover it all.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Random Thoughts at the Year's End <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ying</p>
<p>Time seems to have passed in a dream. In the blink of an eye, 1934 is drawing to a close, lightning-fast time!</p>
<p>People are truly like waves in the sea, not even knowing their own movements, their own future! I, too, am like a wave drifting to this cold island nation! Who would have thought that I would spend 1934 in Tokyo?</p>
<p>Here, I have met many friends who are diligently studying Chinese literature, and I have also met several female comrades who are working hard in cultural work and the women's liberation movement. They are all pioneers of the era, warriors striving to create a new society. I am very happy. Although looking out from my lonely little room, the earth is so cold, gloomy, and a vast expanse of white snow, my spirit is as excited as spring!</p>
<p>Whether it is day or night, I never dare to rest. I feel that life is too short, there is so much knowledge to seek, so much to do. Even a minute of time should not be allowed to pass lightly, let alone be wasted.</p>
<p>I often think that women have more work to do than men, and that women bear a greater mission than men, because in addition to working hard in cultural undertakings, we must also strive for the liberation movement of oppressed women. Not to mention all the trivial matters in the family, which are also the responsibility of women. Therefore, all female writers should bear at least two responsibilities: on the one hand, to work hard in cultural work, and on the other hand, to strive for the liberation movement of oppressed women.</p>
<p>Except for one or two countries, women all over the world are in a state of oppression. They are just as human as men, but because of the unequal social and economic system, they live an inhuman life, a hellish and dark life. Female comrades who are working hard in cultural work, only women themselves deeply understand the suffering of women, and deeply sympathize with them. In fact, we should not say that we sympathize with them, because we ourselves are in the same state of oppression as they are, and our own lives are also as unfree, as tragic, painful, and pitiful as theirs. We must stand up our spirits and do the entire women's liberation movement of the oppressed! In our creations, we must also describe more of the lives of the laboring class women, their suffering and their demands.</p>
<p>1934 is coming to an end! Let everyone quietly think about it, what have we contributed to art in this year, what have we contributed to society? I think perhaps everyone has feelings? Everyone thinks that time has passed too quickly, another year has ended, the work they had planned has not been completed, society is still a dark society, our lives are still unfree lives, countless millions of oppressed people have sacrificed in hunger and cold, in the midst of artillery fire! Writing to this point, I stopped writing, and respectfully offer the 1934 memorial to the Chinese masses who sacrificed in the struggle!</p>
<p>The New Year is coming soon! I don't feel as happy as I did in my childhood, but I am not sad either. Let the past ice pass, we must seize the present, and even more tightly grasp the future! The cold and gloomy winter will go away with the end of the year, and the warm spring will give us the strength to move forward, to strive to create a new culture, and a new life for women, my dear comrades!</p>

<h3 id="e304">Chinese Literature in the Past Year <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xinhua</p>
<p>This year is called a "Magazine Year," and among the more than six hundred privately published periodicals, there seem to be quite a few that focus on "pure literature." However, no matter who you ask, they will say that the Chinese literary scene in 1934 was not very lively. Speaking of literary theory, there have been no major or truly worthwhile books on literary principles, literary criticism, and literary history published this year. Nor have there been any systematic debates on general literary theory. There have only been short essays published in the "Editorial Notes" of various literary journals, and debates sparked in the back pages of newspapers on issues such as the "Beijing School" and "Shanghai School." Of course, some of these raised relatively important issues, such as philology and literary heritage, which are undoubtedly of great significance. However, even in these debates, the theoretical expression has been relatively weak. As for creative works, that is even more difficult to talk about. Facts tell us that this year, apart from a few short stories published in various literary journals, there are almost no good full-length single-volume works to be found. Not to mention new writers, even some established writers such as Mao Dun, Lu Xun, and Yu Dafu have not produced anything this year. Perhaps because of the need to fill the void in the creative world, the most common works published in single volumes this year are "Selected Works of So-and-So" or "Selected Short Stories," and so on.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese literary scene in 1934 was not entirely barren, with nothing at all. Although the expressions in both theory and creative works were very weak, there were still some expressions. Moreover, in the theoretical aspect, because several important issues were raised and discussed, even if it cannot yield any results at present, it has a great driving force for the development of Chinese literature. Therefore, in order to understand the past and look forward to the future, it is still necessary for us to review the Chinese literary scene in the past year.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the several issues that caused controversy in the Chinese literary scene this year.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the essay was the first to make a splash in the Chinese literary scene this year. With the great popularity of essays, a war between essays and long articles was triggered. Humor master Lin Yutang took the lead in starting "The World," specializing in advocating essays, declaring that essays could "talk about the universe" or "talk about flies," truly capable of anything. But those on the other side said: "Essays are only suitable for expressing flies, not suitable for expressing the universe. To explain the universe, and thus solve the problems of the universe, long and detailed articles are necessary. Short essays cannot handle this. No matter what, a genius at writing essays cannot explain the origin and evolution of the universe in a short essay. Of course, essays can also explain a part of the problem of the universe, and can also grasp a certain point to explain the entire universe, but that is all. It still cannot be considered capable of explaining and thus solving the big problems of the universe and life. If an essay writer wants to mark out a cosmic or social problem, attempting to explain and thus solve it in a short text, the result will certainly be a failure." (See "The Great America Evening News" May 11th)</p>
<p>Those who advocated essays, because essays are valued for being short and concise, also issued the argument that "brevity is precious in writing." But opponents also refuted this: "...Even using tens of millions of words to write about a person's psychological changes within a day would not be considered redundant. And Wu Cheng'en's original "Journey to the West" is even more verbose than Zhu Dingchen and Yang Zhihe's abridged versions. If someone were to abridge "Dream of the Red Chamber" into a two- or three-thousand-word excerpt, wouldn't the essence be completely lost, and only the dross remain! The so-called modern short story is not only valued for being short. Many important short stories are often more than twenty or thirty thousand words.</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>"Primitive history used a few words or dozens of words to record a person's life, but today's novels write a story of one day into tens of millions of words. Is this evolution or regression? It can be understood without further explanation." (See "Literature" Volume 2, Number 6)</p>
<p>This is indeed a powerful refutation of the essay masters who excessively elevated the status of essays and advocated "brevity is precious in writing."</p>
<p>However, later, there was also a divergence within the scope of essays: on the one hand, there were essays with new content represented by "Taibai," and on the other hand, there were the so-called "expressing aspirations" essays represented by "The World," which attempted to revive classical Chinese. Although the former has not yet produced any achievements, the ideas and emotions it conveys are relatively progressive. The latter, on the other hand, uses the feelings, letters, and doggerel poems of several old-fashioned professors in Beiping to show off themselves, and its use is only for leisure after tea and wine. Master Yutang himself said it well: "The bi-monthly (referring to his essay bi-monthly | author) has about 40,000 words, just enough to read and relax for two hours in the evening. After reading, roll up the quilt and go to sleep. When I get up tomorrow, I will still work in the office, copy relief, and issue notices as a principal, feeling a hundred times more energetic, just like someone who goes to a restaurant for a small drink. The taste of fresh bamboo shoots fried with flat beans from last night is still on the tip of my tongue." (See "The World" Fourth Issue)</p>
<p>Following the debate on the essay issue, the issue of language was raised. Among these, the first to attract people's attention was Mr. Chen Zizhan's article "Classical Chinese | Vernacular Chinese | Mass Language" in "Free Talk" on June 18th. Since then, publications such as "Trend" in "China Daily," "Local Supplement" in "Shen Bao," "New Linguistic Forest," "Taibai," "Social Daily," "Social Monthly," and other publications have been caught up in the vortex of this debate. Almost all of the country's new and old writers participated in this debate. If all the writings on this issue were completely collected, I think there would be at least two thick volumes. However, due to space and other reasons, I cannot introduce and critique the opinions of all parties here. Please readers study them yourselves. Here, I will just summarize the main opinions of the various parties:</p>
<p>Some people say that classical Chinese is concise and valuable, so they attempt to revive classical Chinese;</p>
<p>Another group advocates preserving the ideas of the "May Fourth" era and supports vernacular Chinese;</p>
<p>Still another group are eclecticists, saying that classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese each have their own advantages, advocating the use of both together;</p>
<p>There are also those who feel that classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese are both outdated, advocating the establishment of a mass language: and further abolishing square characters, adopting Romanized spelling, to thoroughly transform Chinese language and writing.</p>
<p>Among these several opinions, who is right? I cannot make a simple judgment here with the words "yes" or "no," but rather hope that the readers will study them in detail themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also "the issue of accepting literary heritage," "the issue of translating foreign works," and "the issue of why China has not been able to produce great works." These are all important issues raised in the Chinese literary scene this year. However, also due to space limitations, I cannot explain them one by one here. Now, for what is necessary for us,</p>

<h3 id="e305">General Overview of the World and China in 1934 <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhi</p>
<p>Time flies relentlessly forward. Last year has just passed, and this year is already coming to an end. I remember when we first placed the 1934 calendar on our desks, some prophet predicted that a military leader and a politician would die within the year. Indeed, German General Hindenburg passed away this year, and Little Napoleon Dollfuss was assassinated in Vienna. King Alexander of Yugoslavia and French Foreign Minister Barthou were also shot in Marseille. The beloved King Albert also fell off a cliff and died an unnatural death, and Soviet Central Committee member Kirov was also assassinated just days ago. This doubly proves the accuracy of our prophet's predictions!</p>
<p>In reality, the world is so vast, and there are so many people called politicians and military leaders. Wouldn't one or two politicians or military leaders die within a year, especially in these crisis-ridden times? However, since the prophet's prediction has been proven, there is no need for us to comment further!</p>
<p>Just as it was predicted that someone would inevitably die in 1934, many political and military experts have made equally startling predictions: that World War II will inevitably break out in 1936! They even say with relish that once the war breaks out, a certain country's warships will sail to a certain place, and another country's air force will bomb a certain city; at first, a certain country will definitely be defeated, and then it will inevitably turn defeat into victory... Although we are not yet sure whether such fortune-telling calculations are completely accurate, judging from the many important international events of the past year, the crisis of war is indeed approaching us day by day. Please flip through the past calendar! The constant disturbances in Vienna, the repeated mobilization of Italian troops, the purges by the German and Soviet authorities, the turmoil in Spain, the urgency of the situation in Central Europe and the Balkans, the sound of cannons in the Chaco War in South America, the bankruptcy of the preliminary Anglo-American-Japanese naval conference, the deterioration of Soviet-Japanese relations... These great facts tell us that the god of war is like a fast airplane, sometimes circling in Central Europe, sometimes flying over the Pacific Ocean. No one can say when it will land and where!</p>
<p>Smart friends, you must know that whether the prophet's predictions have been proven by facts, or whether the calculations of politicians and military leaders are accurate, these do not have much research significance; however, the fact that prophets and politicians insist on predicting what kind of people will die within a year, and insist on calculating the time of the outbreak of the world war, doesn't this precisely indicate the nervousness of the general public? Yes, on the eve of a major event, the general public is always nervous. This is a general description of the world in 1934.</p>
<p>What about China? According to the regulations of those enthusiastic about the national goods movement, 1934 is the "Women's National Goods Year," and according to the literati, this year is also the "Magazine Year." In fact, both are reasonable. In fact, within this year, women have indeed made considerable efforts to promote national goods. In addition to formal expressions such as meetings and parades, one can imagine the achievements of the national goods movement this year simply by looking at the bustling scene of the national goods department stores on Nanjing Road; at the same time, it is said that more than 1,000 magazines were published this year. Compared with previous years, this year can certainly be said to be the "Magazine Year." However, in the "Women's National Goods Year," according to reports, the import of various cosmetics is still particularly high, and the amount of import surplus seems to be still rising; at the same time, in the "Magazine Year," although there are more than 1,000 magazines, compared with other advanced countries, it is still very, very few, and even among these more than 1,000 magazines, very few are really worth reading. In the past year, apart from the issue of "short essays" and "long essays," it seems that no more satisfactory works have been produced on the literary scene. All of this fully illustrates that our efforts in 1934 were not enough, and we need another "National Goods Year" and another "Magazine Year"! Friends, come! Concentrate all our strength, let's stir up the huge waves of the nation, let's stir up the raging tide of the Chinese sea!</p>
<p>At the same time, if we look at the situation of Chinese society under the oppression of imperialism in the past year, it is also frightening. Looking up, almost all we see are the wounds of the masses, and all we hear are the tragic cries of the masses! The widespread floods and droughts across the country have already caused countless victims to be unable to survive; under the onslaught of the economic downturn, countless factories and workshops have closed down this year, countless shops have declared liquidation, and countless unemployed people have been added. This situation is again warning us how we should continue to fight!</p>
<p>Friends, the world situation is so urgent, and all the circumstances in China are telling us that we must continue to work hard and struggle. In this regard, how will you settle the past and plan for the future? Isn't this a very serious question?</p>
<p>It is still necessary to briefly talk about Chinese literary creation in the past year.</p>
<p>After searching the bookstores on the Four Horses Road, I finally found two novella (or even novels) published this year: Shen Congwen's "Border Town" and Lao She's "Little Slope's Birthday." But I just want to talk about the former here; as for the latter, I will talk about it when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>In "Border Town," the author first tells us that on the border of western Hunan there is a small mountain town called "Chadong." Here, there is a small stream, an old man, a girl, and a yellow dog managing a ferryboat on the stream, constantly ferrying passengers back and forth every day. The old man and the girl are both very kind and gentle, and they are very faithful to their duties. They don't charge money from passengers, and sometimes even if the passengers want to give the old man some money, he will absolutely refuse, and even get so anxious that he will quarrel with the passengers if they insist on giving money. Even the yellow dog is very understanding. As soon as the boat reaches the shore, it will jump ashore and use its mouth to pull the rope for the old man. Then the author tries to depict how kind the customs and human feelings of this "Border Town" Chadong are, how pure and kind, loyal and gentle the general public is. All the sailors, boat owners, merchants, soldiers, and even prostitutes here are all secure in their professions and willing to help others; here, there is no deception, no disturbance, no cruel and unfair phenomena, only honesty, peace, and the expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy that exist in "general human nature." In the current real situation, this can truly be said to be a "Peach Blossom Spring"!</p>
<p>But all the situations in the "Peach Blossom Spring," and the general way of life in it, existed in Chinese society many years ago. The China of today does not have this world. The China of today is a bankrupt rural economy, and a declining urban industry and commerce. What we see are all phenomena of starvation and cold, deception, and unrest.</p>
<p>Some of the people who live in the real environment of deception and disturbance feel the evil of reality and yearn for the past. If you are willing to go to the countryside and to the older generation of old people, then you will often hear this kind of saying: The past was still good, the Qing Dynasty was good. People at that time were all honest. How could people today be so cunning? Alas, when will a true emperor come out! All the situations in Chadong mentioned above, and the social thought in "Border Town," are reflections of this kind of consciousness.</p>
<p>In order to express this idea, the author constructed a love story, which is the backbone of "Border Town." In the middle of this, the author depicts how Cui Cui, the niece of the loyal old boatman, and the second son of the boat owner Shunshun are in love with each other, but the boat owner's eldest son also loves Cui Cui. Later, because the eldest son felt that he could not compete with his younger brother, he went out to run a business in the lower reaches of the river, but unexpectedly he was drowned on the way; as a result, the boat owner and his second son were not satisfied with the old boatman, thinking that their son and elder brother had been killed because he was meddling; later, the old boatman died, and although the boat owner wanted to marry Cui Cui as his daughter-in-law, his second son had gone out and had not returned, and it was not known when he would return, or whether he would return. Thus, the novel "Border Town" ends. In the middle of this, the author is doing his best to depict the twists and turns of the story line, strengthening the artistic effect of his social thought of anti-expression. But because the social thought he reflects is a social thought that attempts to escape reality, and the world he expresses is not the real world, but the past world, it greatly harms the value of his work; moreover, in many places, we still feel that the author's descriptive power is not enough. For example, when the old boatman dies, the lonely Cui Cui, in addition to crying, does not have any moving expression. In fact, a person who has been stimulated by the greatest pain, especially a person like Cui Cui, does not only cry. Her actions and her psychology are bound to undergo great changes. But the author only expresses this with abstract crying.</p>
<p>If an author's autobiography can also be regarded as a literary work, then here we can cite "Ba Jin's Autobiography."</p>
<p>I do not know Ba Jin, but I like him and admire him. Why? Because, first, he can always be faithful to his beliefs, unlike some of his companions, who jump around casually. Of course, whether his beliefs are entirely correct is still a question that needs to be discussed, but in the current situation of moral corruption, he can always be responsible for the truth he knows, and not jump around casually, which is worthy of admiration. In his autobiography published this year, he still said so firmly: "I have never lost my faith at any time, so I have always endured all this like a tough man. I did not utter a cry of pain. Although my novels sometimes contain deep melancholy, this melancholy has never obscured that ray of light. My love for humanity encourages me and gives me the strength to struggle with everything." This spirit is the first reason why I like Ba Jin. Second, Ba Jin can live and write seriously. He does not leave reality. He often travels and goes deep into the general population to investigate and experience their lives, and then faithfully depicts and contributes them to society. Of course, whether the reality described under his worldview is suitable for the situation and requirements of the objective world is still a problem, but his courage to approach reality and his efforts to be as faithful to reality as possible in his creation are still worthy of our admiration. This is the second reason why I like Ba Jin.</p>
<p>Although "Ba Jin's Autobiography" is very short, it also tells the author's story in Spring. After reading this, one can know a little about the author's childhood life, family situation, and creative process. As for the writing style, because the author is a writer with creative experience, it is also very good. However, one point cannot completely satisfy us, that is, the several major eras that the author has gone through (such as the "Xinhai Revolution," such as the era after 1925) have not been clearly revealed in the middle, thus reducing the social significance of this autobiography.</p>
<p>In addition, it seems that there are quite a few creative things in this year's edition, such as "collections" and "selections." According to what I have seen, there are:</p>
<p>Shen Congwen: "Ru Collection" Life Edition</p>
<p>Lao She: "Catching Up Collection"</p>
<p>Liangyou Edition</p>
<p>Mao Dun: "Tales"</p>
<p>Liangyou Edition</p>
<p>Mu Shiying: "Platinum Female Statue" Modern Edition Zhang Tianyi: "Migration" Liangyou Edition</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>But my article seems to have been written too long, and I can't comment on these anymore, so let's end it like this.</p>
<h3 id="e306">Chinese Drama in the Past Year <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Zheng Lang</p>
<p>Here I want to make a nationwide narrative. But because I am limited by my personal experience and incomplete materials, there will inevitably be omissions and errors here. I must first ask the readers to forgive me and point out any corrections.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, except for a few places such as Nanjing, the theatrical atmosphere in most parts of the country is very quiet. Due to the determination of the objective environment, the breathing of dramatists often fails to be as free as people imagine. Furthermore, due to the lack of subjective ability, the results of the efforts of the dramatists often fail to be as good as expected. This year, whether from the perspective of drama periodicals, drama disputes, or performances, there has not been a brilliant performance. Now, we might as well make a brief liquidation of these aspects.</p>
<p>(1) The Decline of Drama Periodicals This year is a famous "Magazine Year", but this "Magazine Year" has no relationship with drama. It is rare to see the creation of drama magazines. Although at the end of this 1934, we have already seen the "Modern Drama" monthly magazine edited by four gentlemen, Bao Shiling, He Wu Tieyi, and Lu Si, which was announced in September and October, but the only special drama publication that we have recently worn is this one. In March and April of last year, we found in the bookstore "Performing Arts" founded by a part of Shanghai drama people, but it was only a thin book, and it disappeared after three issues. In other cities in China, it is rare to hear of the creation of single-copy drama magazines. Although there is a "Journal of Drama Studies" published by the "Institute of Chinese Opera and Music" in Peiping, this is not a spoken drama magazine. What they advocate is mainly old dramas, and spoken drama articles are not easy to find in it.</p>
<p>The situation of the drama supplements of newspapers is better, but from a comprehensive examination, it is still not satisfactory. In Shanghai, the "Drama Weekly" (later renamed "Drama Movement") of the Min Bao was discontinued in June for some reason. The "Torch" of the Da Wan Bao did not see any follow-up after publishing an issue of "Drama Garden" not long ago for some reason. The drama weekly edited by Yuan Muzhi of the Zhonghua Daily is now a relatively readable drama publication in the country, which is slightly satisfactory. Its predecessor was "Drama and Film", which was renamed "Drama Weekly" in August and expanded its size to its current form in early September. This publication is currently being converted into a single copy. In addition, the "Drama Edition" of the Social Evening News, which was recently founded, has not attracted people's attention so far, probably because of the newspaper's sales or the content of the publication.</p>
<p>Nanjing is said to be the "Drama Year" this year, but judging from the drama publications that guide the progress of the drama movement, it seems that there are not many achievements to be seen. Ma Yanxiang founded "Drama Weekly" in the Central Daily in June, but this did not add any strength to the Nanjing drama scene. Its content can be said to have no relationship with the Nanjing drama community. This publication rarely publishes even drama reviews and news. In October, Hua Bao founded "Dance Art", "Later Comes First", and the latter is superior to the former in terms of the freshness and richness of content and form.</p>
<p>In the north, drama publications are even more scattered. I have not heard of any decent drama publications in Peiping, the "Ancient Capital" and "Cultural City", this year. Although the "Drama Weekly" edited by Zhang Mingqi of the Tianjin Yong Bao occasionally publishes some readable articles, Tianjin, which is so big, also has "only one". The "Drama Weekly" edited by Yan Zhewu of the Jinan Shandong Min Bao is narrow in size and its content is not very substantial. Other things worth mentioning are rarely seen.</p>
<p>In South China, Guangzhou has always had a very thick theatrical atmosphere. Many drama publications have been published in the past, but this year it seems particularly depressed, scattered and without any expression.</p>
<p>(2) Controversy 1 There are very few heated disputes in the drama world this year, which reflects the current</p>
<h3 id="e307">Stage of "Fragrant Rice" <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Performed by the Nanjing Mass Drama Society</p>
<h3 id="e308">The Stage of "Suicide" <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Performed by the Nanjing Popular Drama Society</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>The barrenness of the theatrical world. However, comparatively speaking, there are a few minor controversies worth mentioning. The first is the different reviews caused by the performance of "Noble People". At that time, the criticisms of this play in various newspapers were said to be "more complimentary than strictly critical." Later, four gentlemen, including Li Ren, in "Performing Arts," and Mr. Sheng Fu in this publication, successively published two relatively strict criticisms, pointing out that the author could not completely "grasp objective reality and correctly portray it." Although this may seem a bit "harsh," the author, Ling He, has partially accepted this shortcoming, and he has partially corrected it in the standalone edition of the play.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mei Lanfang's trip to Russia has continued to attract considerable attention. Some people have said with extreme sarcasm and contempt that Dr. Mei's trip to Russia is to "go on a mission," while others regard the Russian invitation as a victory for the "Symbolist" Chinese opera and thus prove the decline of Soviet Russian realism. However, others say that these are all superficial and shallow views, arguing that the Soviet Russian invitation is to study the form and performance methods of Chinese opera, critically accepting the legacy of Eastern feudal art in order to build a new performing art. Regarding this issue, the China Daily News Drama Weekly published some insightful discussions in issues 10 through 16, which attracted great attention.</p>
<p>The issue of radio drama broadcasts also caused a minor controversy. In "Drama Weekly" and the Min Bao's "Drama Movement," several readers expressed disagreement with the current radio dramas, considering them to be nothing more than a "neighbor's play," a "modern storytelling," or a "new-style storytelling." The former even pointed out the emptiness and boredom of current radio dramas. Later, a gentleman in the Ta Wan Pao's Torch argued that radio drama has value, but this opinion did not attract much attention. Personally, I feel that radio drama has the possibility and necessity to become an independent art form, but I am also deeply dissatisfied with the boredom and chaos of the current radio drama broadcasting world.</p>
<p>The issue of popular language and drama also seemed to have caused a period of discussion. However, most opinions believe that if drama is to be popularized, the use of popular language is a necessary result, so there are no differing opinions.</p>
<p>(3) Performance Summary | Here, I want to describe some things about this year's performances. Let's start with Shanghai:</p>
<p>(1) Variety Shows | A Special Form of Performance in Shanghai: Shanghai's theater performers have a kind of distress, which is that they have plays but cannot perform them. This naturally has both subjective and objective reasons. Therefore, they have no choice but to accept invitations from social groups for variety shows. I think the following variety shows this year are more decent and worth mentioning:</p>
<p>The first was the performance of "Noble People," written and directed by film critic Ling He at the invitation of the Table Yearbook Association. This is not purely a variety show, but it is not purely a "public performance" either, so I still classify it as a variety show.</p>
<p>The second was the variety show of the Women's Voice Society. This time, a total of four plays were performed: "Oppression," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "Miracle," and "Three Sisters." Except for "Oppression," the other three plays were mostly new works of this year. The performance effects were generally well-received by the newspapers.</p>
<p>The third was the variety show of the Mulun Middle School. This time, a total of four plays were performed: "The Peddler in the Snow," "Yangtze River Storm," "Nora After Leaving Home," and "Tight Report." "The Peddler in the Snow" did not perform well due to its inferior creative technique. "Tight Report" and "Nora After Leaving Home" were still able to satisfy the audience, but the best effect was achieved by "Yangtze River Storm." This is a new form of opera with substantial content, exquisite writing techniques, and excellent acting skills. This is probably the most successful work of 1934.</p>
<p>The fourth was the variety show of the Hunan Fellow Villagers Association. There was only one scene of spoken drama, "Extra," and the effect and content were acceptable.</p>
<p>(2) Public Performances | Although there were several public performances, they do not seem to have attracted much attention. At the end of May, the Fudan Drama Society performed "The Emperor Jones," which was criticized as a "child's play." The results can be imagined. In June, the Shang College Drama Society premiered "Father Returns" and "Relighting the Broken Fire." One drawback of this public performance was that these two plays were not easy to attract audiences. The Shanghai University National Drama Society performed "The Second Dream," which also committed the same mistake. The Jinan Drama Society also staged "Good May Not Be Willing," "Collecting Fishing Tax," and "Tide" at this time, which also did not attract much attention. Recently, the John Drama Society performed "Death of a Famous Actor," "Wangba," and "Executioner," and the Qingzhong Drama Society of the YMCA Middle School also performed "Fool" and "Great Thief," but both were limited to the small scope of the school and failed to attract a wide audience. In addition, the Shanghai University Drama Association staged four plays, "Maona Vanna," "Poor Pei Jia," "Self-Help," and "John Manley," on August 16th and 17th, which were able to attract some attention.</p>
<p>General social theater groups also lacked expression. The Drama Association has not had any expression since the public performance of "Roar, China." Several theater groups in 1933 have also disappeared. Although an unknown theater group staged several plays in the spring, such as "Laundry Boss and Poet," "Who is a Friend," "Locked Box," "Whaling," "Wanderer," "Plum Rain," "Brothers," and "Three Families Living Together," the scale was not large, but it had a small effect. Another Tuosheng Drama Society performed O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," which was considered an effort. The Lingling Drama Society performed several old plays such as "White Tea," "Consensus," "Way Out," and "Thief." The Ant Drama Troupe performed "Father Returns," "Moon Rising," and "Jinbao" in June, which were well-received. Some of these theater groups were just a flash in the pan, and some have not been heard from since (it is said that Ant is preparing for a performance). In addition, some spoken dramas are often performed in variety shows in major and minor schools and girls' schools, but some of these so-called spoken dramas have "famous" guest appearances, and some are just a riot, performing civilized plays. Here, I can only give a general overview and not mention them in detail.</p>
<p>In Nanjing, this year is "Drama Year," and public performances are often heard of. In the spring, Tang Huaiqiu's Chinese Touring Theater Troupe staged "Meiluo Xiang" in Nanjing, and the ticket price was sold for five yuan, and the business was good. Later, this theater troupe joined with nine groups, including the Chinese Literature and Art Society, the Contradiction Society, and the Popular Drama Society, to stage several old plays such as "Oppression," "Fool," "Woman and Dog," and "Gentleman on the Beam," but they did not attract much attention. In early May, the Popular Drama Society staged "Fragrant Rice," which caused a stir for a while. There were many criticisms in the newspapers, indicating that this play had a lot of appeal. The Chinese Drama Association staged Xiao Boner's "Heroes and Beauties" in June after performing plays such as "Fool." The content of this play was quite criticized, but the scenery was good. Soon, the Nandi Drama Society also performed "Salome." During the summer vacation, the Shanghai Dadi Drama Society went to Nanjing to stage plays such as "Death of a Famous Actor," "The Miser," "Father and Teacher," "Thief," and "Prison," which were able to attract some attention. In the autumn, the Youth Drama Society staged plays such as "Prison," "Thief," and "Selling Cattle," and the Popular Drama Society staged plays such as "Suicide" and "Three Sheng of Rice." The Xinyue Drama Society staged plays such as "Buying and Selling" and "The Last Embrace." All were small-scale.</p>
<p>In the north, Beiping has always been the place with the strongest drama atmosphere, but this year it is particularly deserted. The only public performance worth mentioning was "The Butcher," performed by the Beiping Drama Society organized by Xiong Fuxi and Zhang Mingqi in August. In addition, although the "Northern Country" and "Shacheng" drama societies had public performance plans, they both disappeared silently. Yu Shangyuan's small theater now only has an empty shell with a grand sign. Tang Huaiqiu's touring theater troupe brought to Beiping some old plays from seven or eight years ago and three or four years ago, such as "Meiluo Xiang," "The Female Shopkeeper," "Death of a Famous Actor," "Parasitic Grass," "Drunk," "White Tea," "Jealousy," "Buying and Selling," and "Fool." The theater scene in Beiping this year is really too barren. In Tianjin, the Parrot and Weimo drama societies have both performed plays this year, and the Gusong Drama Society has also performed "Drunk" and "Disabled," but these have not attracted people's attention.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou in the south, the spoken drama atmosphere was very prosperous during the "January 28th" commemoration. At that time, there were several plays such as the City Beauty Drama Society's "Two Wounded Soldiers," the Peizheng Literary Research Association's "Death of Shui Xinglin," the Zhongda Anti-Japanese Drama Society's "Comrades" and "Way Out," the Provincial First Vocational Drama Society's "Night Express," and the four schools' joint performance of "Order to Retreat to the Second Line of Defense," which were all good. In March, the Provincial First Vocational School also performed "Night Express" and "The Last Line." At that time, the Taishan Expedition Team was organized by the Yuanshu Middle School Drama Troupe to perform plays such as "Buying and Selling," "Behind the Screen," and "White Tea." After that, there were some unimportant sporadic public performances by some school drama societies. In August, the People's Education Center performed three plays, "Artist," "Sisters," and "Chastity." On September 18th, "Roar, China" was performed, but the lyrics were mostly revised. The People's Education Center opened a drama research institute in August, which now has more than 60 students.</p>
<p>In addition, there are unimportant sporadic performances in cities across the country such as Hangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Nanchang, Chongqing, Jinan, Xiamen, etc. Here, I will give a general overview and not mention them in detail.</p>
<p>(4) Rural Drama Movement | Xiong Fuxi in Dingxian and Gu Jianchen in Wuxi are both doing rural drama work to some extent. Mr. Xiong's purpose is to cultivate farmers' interest in drama and their automatic engagement in drama activities, in order to achieve the effect of civilian education. Mr. Xiong's efforts are commendable, but the things he gives to the farmers, such as "Trumpet," "Butcher," "Cow," and "Hoe Athletes," cannot alleviate the farmers' hunger. Although the public performance of "Trumpet" on Double Tenth Festival was "novel," it only affected a very small number of farmers. The commemorative public performance of the first farmer's open-air theater on the 2nd of this month included plays such as "Trumpet," "Drunkard," "Wang Si," "Moon Rising," "Dead End," "Lan Zhi and Zhong Qing," "Three Cows," "Marriage Proposal," "Fox Fairy Temple," and "Butcher," most of which lacked a close relationship with the real life of farmers. As for Mr. Gu, although he does have research on "costume speech," he is not as good as Mr. Xiong in other aspects.</p>
<p>(5) The So-Called Experimental Theater Society | Finally, I want to mention the Shandong Provincial Experimental Theater, which was recently established and is led by Wang Bosheng. Wang Bosheng used to be engaged in spoken drama, but later became a "famous amateur" and "famous actor." He even came to Shanghai this year to perform Beijing opera. Now he is appreciated by the Shandong art education community. He mainly engages in Beijing opera there. Although Zhang Mingqi and others cooperate in spoken drama, it is listed in an unimportant position.</p>
<p>This is all I have to say. The year 1934 has passed, and now we can only look forward to a richer harvest in 1935.</p>

After Jingyi received the shocking letter, he was fortunate to recover from his illness, but the 128 incident was unfortunate, and Ms. Fen's old illness relapsed and died. On April 22nd, at 2:00 PM, Jingyi was too sad and developed a depressed illness for more than a month, and then angrily became a guest wandering around the world. Passing through Biao Island, another love tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>In the winter of the 21st year, Jingyi was busy painting stage scenery, regretting that he had no time for artistic creation and lamenting that what he had learned was not useful. Suddenly, a naive and polite young woman came with an old woman to "ask Jingyi to paint a portrait." He agreed to start at any time. After being depressed for some time, Jingyi was unexpectedly able to paint. The international students were in the room, and she came again, saying that she would come again tomorrow. It snowed the next day and she didn't come. She didn't come the next day either. She came the day after that.</p>

See those pine and cypress trees with evergreen. Door gods have already been posted on the front door. There is also a spring couplet on both sides. The first line is that heaven bestows peace and happiness upon the family. The second line is that all the talented children in the world bring wealth and spring. The back door is posted with Zhong Jinshi. The other side is written Yichun. The poor live in bustling cities and no one asks. The rich live deep in the mountains and have distant relatives. The first day of spring is a time of movement. Renewing the four seeds brings a full spring. Thousands of households rejoice.</p>

<h3 id="e318">A Brief Discussion on the Production Techniques of Chinese Films Based on Works Such as "Rebirth Flower" <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Starting with "Life," it is gratifying to see that Chinese film technology has indeed made significant progress. Of course, the technological progress we demand is definitely not like that of European and American films, which rely on sophisticated technology to exaggerate empty content. What we demand is the complete harmony of content and form.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, capitalist films often have form surpassing content, while emerging films lack new techniques to express new content because appropriate techniques are still being gradually discovered, while capitalist film technology has already developed to its final stage.</p>
<p>However, here I do not want to discuss the entire method of expression, but only want to talk about production techniques, that is, I will not discuss narrative methods or montage, but only sound recording techniques or photography techniques.</p>
<p>In terms of sound films, "Rebirth Flower" must be brought up as an example. Here, Hu Die plays both sisters. When the two sisters appear in the same frame, it is very troublesome in terms of photography. In addition to shooting a scene twice, it is also necessary to use a fake Hu Die's back. This kind of photography method has a considerable effect in satisfying the audience's curiosity, and as a result, it becomes one of the reasons why "Sister Flowers" or "Rebirth Flower" can be a box office success. And the photography technique has improved, for example, the average audience does not notice the traces of the fake. Speaking of sound recording, "Rebirth Flower" has indeed made significant progress compared to previous Chinese sound films. Although the sound effects of the sound film have not been fully utilized, the clarity of the recording, every word, and every song can be understood clearly, which is indeed commendable.</p>
<p>Another example that must be mentioned is "Peach and Plum Calamity". This work certainly has good content and can be called the use of the functions of sound films, but because it was the first attempt at a Three-Friend recording machine, the sound is not clear enough. (Perhaps it was a problem during the printing of the soundtrack.) In terms of photography, except for the re-shot places, it is not clear enough (such as when Yuan Muzhi thought of his wife's painful labor in the factory, re-shooting a person struggling in bed above the furnace, it is impossible to recognize that it is Chen Boer), the rest of the lighting or camera angles are very successful.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of silent films, I would like to bring up a few for discussion. The excellent photography of "Woman" and "Fragrant Snow Sea" goes without saying, and the recently released films such as "Goddess", "Bigamy", and "Flying Flower Village" all show that the photographers are working very hard. Everyone is deepening their research at an accelerated pace, almost competing extremely on the works. This phenomenon is, in any case, worthy of the joy of people who care about Chinese films.</p>
<p>As for the sets, generally speaking, apart from the fact that they are limited by capital and cannot compete with the so-called magnificent European and American films (in fact, it is not a proper development to work on magnificent sets that are close to waste), in terms of the composition or color of the sets, many films have achieved the level determined by the content, that is to say, the set designers have done their duty to express the content of the works.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the production technology of Chinese films has indeed made significant progress recently. The previous saying that there is no new form to express new content is now slowly overcoming this difficulty.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e319">Review of "Rebirth Flower" <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>After the film "Sister Flowers" broke the stagnant air in the Chinese film scene, it almost became a surprising work that many people valued. However, the reason why "Sister Flowers" was so successful is certainly because the plot can cater to the tastes of ordinary idle petty bourgeois audiences, but the vivid plot, the sorrowful story, the clear photography and sound recording, and the successful performances of Hu Die, Xuan Jinglin, Zheng Xiaoqiu, etc., are all enough to make this film shock the silver screen and break the unprecedented box office record, which is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Now that I have watched the sequel to "Sister Flowers", "Rebirth Flower", I might as well talk about it casually. Fortunately, commenting on films is originally a matter of benevolence seeing benevolence and wisdom seeing wisdom. Everyone expresses their own opinions.</p>
<p>After Erbao rescued Dabao in "Sister Flowers" out of maternal instinct, it could have ended there, but now to have the extra "Rebirth Flower" seems superfluous. It is written here that after Erbao rescued Dashu from prison, she would encounter many hardships, and the love history between Erbao and a revolutionary youth from the past was forcibly inserted, which is still an expression of the playwright's consistent ending method.</p>
<p>The confusion of the plot and the blandness of the story in this film are really undeniable. For example, writing about Qian Governor, Xiao Regiment Commander, Zhao Da, etc., certainly exposes the ugly behavior of the warlords, but haven't we already seen these in "Sister Flowers"?</p>
<p>There are also some improprieties in the performance, such as: (1) Because Hu Die played two different typical people alone, many of the movements appeared mechanical, especially in several scenes with doubles, and the dialogue could not be consistent, which inevitably dispersed the power of expression. (2) The theatrical atmosphere inside is too strong, making the audience feel like they are watching a civilized play. (3) The incoherent editing is also enough to ruin the success of the play.</p>
<p>However, there are also many things worth noting, such as the appropriate small actions, the clear sound recording, the lively dialogue, the smooth flow, the soft light, and the competence of the actors. The director's handling of the camera angles is also very sophisticated; these can all bring a lot of effects to the performance of the whole play.</p>
<h3 id="e320">Review of "Flying Flower Village" <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Dahui</p>
<p>Whether from the content or form, "Flying Flower Village" and "Spring Tide" have great differences. The former is just a film depicting a love story, while the latter is a realistic work. What the author shows us here is a tragedy caused by economic oppression. A-Hua's wife being seduced by the stationmaster and later becoming a goddess are all explanations that the environment is everywhere subject to economic forces.</p>
<p>The director handles the whole play very lightly and briskly, and the personalities of the characters in the play are clearly portrayed. The photography at the opening describing the scenery of Flying Flower Village allows us to see a poetic picture. In terms of actors, Gao Zhanfei's strong personality, Hu Ping's expression of love for her husband and children, and Chen Juanjuan's innocence and liveliness are all very suitable for the characters in the play. Wang Naidong's villainous role and Qin Tong's portrayal of the old man are also very successful.</p>
<p>As for the final ending, I believe that the stationmaster's punishment and A-Hua's acquittal have fallen into the formula of good and evil retribution. It would be better to end with the stationmaster escaping justice and A-Hua being executed, which would make the whole play more intense and tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e321">My Review of "Rebirth Flower" <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Nianzu</p>
<p>Since "Sister Flowers" was released and broke the record for opening dates, it has aroused the attention of the Chinese people to the domestically produced sound films that have always been despised.</p>
<p>Now, "Rebirth Flower", which follows "Sister Flowers", has been released in Xinguang, but after watching the film, I feel that this film is not a very successful work. Although director Zheng Zhengqiu is very hardworking, his greatest shortcoming is that he cannot use the special techniques of sound movies to increase the tragic and joyful elements of the whole play. At the same time, he cannot slightly improve the audience's level, and like "Sister Flowers", he only uses twists and turns to win the audience's tears.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, Hu Die's Dabao and Erbao still have their special achievements, although there is no progress compared to "Sister Flowers". Xuan Jinglin's old woman is vividly portrayed, showing great progress. Zheng Sheqiu can be regarded as quite diligent. Tan Zhiyuan, Zhu Qiuhen, Wang Xianzai, etc. are also very hardworking. The other supporting roles are also good.</p>

<h3 id="e322">Secrets of "The Merry Widow" <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Yunmen</p>
<p>The songs sung by Jenny MacDonald, the heroine of "The Merry Widow", are "Vilia", arranged by the great musician Le Bo Luoguan; "Tonight Will Teach to Forget" is sung on the balcony; and "Widows Are Gay". The male lead, Heifeler, sings "I am Going Maxims", "Girls! Girls! Girls!", and "The King Can Do No Wrong." The two sing together "Not a Word."</p>
<p>MacDonald leads "Embassy Dance", "The Merry Widow Whirlwind Dance", and the Parisian "Can Can Dance", which was called the irritating springtime in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The violin of the great musician Le Bo Luofu is called unparalleled in the world. Not only is it a thousand-year-old antique, but it can also play dual tones (Bilingual). Generally speaking, no matter how precious a violin is, it can only emit one kind of high tone (Tenor) or low tone (Bass), but Leqin can play both male and female tones. The beauties in Maxim's dance hall in the film are the best choices in Hollywood, a total of fourteen, with five seats in New York Province, and the remaining nine seats belong to other provinces, which shows the meaning of beautiful women being hard to find again.</p>
<p>In "The Merry Widow", there are two new technical attempts. One is the basket weave dance. The dancers on both sides wear colorful clothes, change their heights, and rotate left and right, like butterflies passing through flowers, which is a creation in the history of dance. One is the memory of sound (Muicai Retro pect). The common method of recalling the past on the screen uses dissolving or dissolving into method (Dissove) to make the old images reappear vividly, but in the film, the Count recalls the past, breaking the old method and replacing it with the mood of sound. This is a new technique of using sound instead of color.</p>
<h3 id="e323">"Vortex" Renamed "Femme Fatale" <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>"Vortex" is Yang Xiaochong's proud masterpiece after "Good Night". This drama stars Chen Yanyan and Zhang Yi, with Liang Saizhen as a guest star. Because the roles they play can all be given individual expression, this drama has superior achievements.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan's performance here is excellent, which goes without saying, and what is most surprising is that Liang Saizhen and Zhang Yi have both made unprecedented gains. According to general opinion, Liang Saizhen seems to have become a new Liang Saizhen in this film, and because Zhang Yi has more opportunities to act here, it has made him the most successful film since joining Lianhua.</p>
<p>"Vortex" will soon meet the public. But the name of "Vortex" seems to need to be changed to a better name. It is rumored that it will be renamed "Femme Fatale".</p>

<p>— Su Hua</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Tang Erna turned around and said to the jurors: "I am guilty. In addition to committing crimes such as treason and dereliction of duty, I have also committed the crime of being fooled. My fate this time can give men a great lesson. When a man can enjoy himself with hundreds of women, if he actually goes to love a woman alone, he is extremely foolish and should be sentenced to death." After he finished speaking, the people in the audience shouted "Tang Erna" with great excitement. The king's attendants immediately rushed to the palace to report the situation of the trial, saying that Tang Erna had confessed his crime. The king heard this and knew that the country was about to go bankrupt. He and the queen were packing their soft luggage and preparing to escape. Just as they were busy, the attendant ran up panting and said, "That...that widow wants to go to the prison to visit Tang Erna." The king and queen heard this and immediately ordered people to go to Bofu and wake up the drowsy Bofu, asking him to invite the prison officials and cabinet members to a meeting. The king said with a happy face, "This plan will not fail."</p>
<p>In the gray prison corridor, Sulia walked step by step. The jailer asked on the side, "Miss, are you a friend of the captain?" "Not much of a friend." "Are you a relative?" "No." "But you knew him before, right?" "Yes." "Then I'm afraid you don't recognize him now. He has completely changed." They talked as they walked, and soon they had reached the door of the cell. The jailer opened the door, and she walked in trembling. There was nothing inside except a bed. At that time, a mouse ran across her instep. The shock scared her to run to the bed. Then Tang Erna walked in. He looked at her as if amused. She said embarrassedly on the bed: "I'm sorry, I was chased in by the mouse." Tang Erna said with a smile, "That mouse chased you from so far away, it's really amazing." Sulia said with a straight face, "Don't think that I came here..." Tang Erna quickly interjected, "To see me? No, definitely not." She replied, "Yes, I came to see you." After she finished speaking, she wanted to leave, but the door was already locked. She pushed hard, and he also came to help push. But there was no result. Hearing no sound outside at all. In fact, at that time, the king was leading a group of people outside listening quietly. Sulia said angrily, "Did you bribe the jailer to lock me in here?" Tang Erna also said, "You must have bribed the jailer to lock yourself in here." Sulia shouted, "I can't stand your insults anymore." "Then why don't you go out?" he asked her. At that time, she really had no way to think. After a while, the small window on the wall opened, and someone sent in fragrant wine and glasses. They looked at each other and had no idea what to do. Tang Erna thought for a while and said, "You didn't bribe the jailer, so he must have locked us together. We were both tricked." Sulia also said, "Then what do we do?" Tang Erna said, "Let's not be intimate." "Yes, let's not be intimate." She also said this. "Let's not fall for his trick. How can we make us fall in love if we hate each other?" She continued. "Okay, let's not fall for his trick." After finishing speaking, Tang Erna went to the small window to get wine to drink. The two drank together. After a while, the intoxicating piano music rang, and the two began to dance. When he wanted to kiss her tightly, she still stubbornly avoided, but when he shouted "A mouse is coming," she rushed to the bed, and he sat beside her with a smile. The eyes of the two communicated with each other, expressing the tacit consent of love. At the same time, the small window opened, revealing the smiling bishop. Before he could finish announcing that he recognized them as a formal couple, Sulia's red lips were already waiting for his passionate kiss. (The End)</p>
