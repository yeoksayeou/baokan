<h3>岡田首相談話</h3>
<p>比率主義不可行</p>
<p>日俄戰爭不可能</p>
<p>宇都宫岡田首相與大角海相·廣田外相·林陸相等會同前往那須問候日皇、已於九日午前七時二十五分由上野車站乘車出發、岡田首相在車中對記者談時局、其大要如左、</p>
<p>今年國防情形頗屬問題、林陸相爲充實國防之財源、將實行增稅云云、此乃新聞紙上之傳說、大藏省或亦研究此事、但是否增稅時期尚不得而知、近來新聞上大論其改組駐滿機關之問題、但實際上似不無誤謬之點、余雖未直接由陸相聽取該案之内容、總之、現在未便談論任何意見耳、</p>
<p>軍縮會之全權代表、世上傳聞當以齋藤前首相或鈴木喜三郎爲適任云云、但將來之事爲期尚遠、現在未便考慮、國防之安全感與比率主義、在道理上不能兩立、持棍棒者勢不能與持槍砲者抗衡、在形勢上爲同樣之事實、故比率案當不可行、關於軍縮會議之問題、外務省與海軍省正在熱心研究之中、似不宜過於焦慮、請委諸當局可也、</p>
<p>日美親美工作之一法、卽近衛公爵所主張設立駐美情報局、確係最善之辦法、蘇滿國境方面、日蘇兩國軍隊時有小接觸式之鬥狠問題發生、國境接壤之區、此種情形當不足怪、如以此爲日蘇關係切迫、則未免失當、日蘇兩國間固有所謂盧布換算問題、又有中東路問題、但不至造成戰爭大問題、賭國運於一擲之戰爭、其勢非同小可、且世上之戰爭亦無如此其簡單也、日前「滿洲國一之遠藤總務廳長與余相晤時、談及「康德皇帝」擬於明春東渡、如此事實現、則於日滿兩國之親善上至爲可慶之事也云云、（九日日聯電）</p>

<h3>日陸軍預算案</h3>
<p>（東京）至十日止、提出大藏省之明年度陸軍豫算概算、係合標準豫算與恒例之新規要求者、加入資村整備費約三億二千萬元、再加入滿洲事件·防空充實費·兵備改善費等新規要求、陸軍豫算總額實達五億五千萬元、（九日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）林陸相九日晨覲見那須御用邸日皇、報告陸軍情形後、搭車回東京、陸相在車中談曰、陸軍省明年度豫算已經决定、其中主要者爲兵器改良費·航空部隊充實費·及其他軍事資材整備費等、滿洲事件費未致减少時期、故明年度豫算不能不比本年之四萬五千餘萬圓增加、航空部隊充實費要三萬萬圓、然因財政狀態不許、故要求最少限度之經費、日俄間訂立不侵條約問題、繫於俄方能否以誠意態度解决各種懸案之事、（九日日聯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）日本爲海軍預備談話遣派來英之海軍專家岩下大佐、已於今日下午行抵此間、岩下所受權力並不甚廣、日後進行之談話、將純爲諮詢性質、惟英國當局、因數月以來日本屢屢發展宣言、且有前後矛盾之處、對於日本態度深覺不得要領、故極欲一聞岩下之談話、以便了然於日本之用意、究竟何在也、岩下此來尚有兩種任務、一則携帶日本政府之訓令、面交日本大使、一則以日本海軍最近在技術上所受之改革、報告於日本駐英之海軍隨員云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>論榆關英兵演習事件恒</h3>
<p>榆關英兵演習事件。引人注意者。已歷十有餘日。英日兵士於演習之時。互相對壘。儼然若在戰時狀態。其間一度曾傳有一英兵爲日方流彈所傷。形勢嚴重。惟其後又傳英兵演習。已告完畢。誤傷英兵一事。英日雙方皆稱傳聞失實。否認其事。</p>
<p>吾人以爲英兵縱有誤傷。亦屬枝節問題。殊無關於大局。卽在現階段下。兩國邦交亦决不至因此地方演習事件而至於破裂。所不可以理解者。以區區數百英兵在日方嚴重戒備之下而作例行之演習。其不足以危害僞滿之存在。至爲顯然。關東軍倡言反對。殊嫌小題大做。如云關東軍因痛心於各國不承認政策而故予難堪之干涉。則其影響將益增無謂之反感。誠何所補於僞滿。且九一八後。英法等國依然享有在滿之領判權。日人本身亦依然佔據旅大租借地及滿鐵附屬地。凡此事實。莫非以中外條約爲根據與藉口。今英兵之演習。與日兵屢次在平津一帶之行動。皆根據於辛丑條約。若一不負國際外交使命之關東軍。必欲堅持其成見。謂中外（中日在内）間之若種條約可以適用於僞滿。若種則不可。固無論關係各國决不肯默爾而息。且將置其本國政府於何地。今姑退一步而假定關東軍在法理上及事實上一般有代僞滿發言之權力。則又不啻自認僞滿爲非一獨立國家。僞滿旣非一獨立國家。而日人又不承認其爲附庸。則其不配有固定之邊界。更不待言矣。若關東軍明知僞滿不配有固定之邊界。而又故作中「滿」國境之爭執。則將何以自圓其說乎。</p>
<p>抑吾人又欲連帶一言者。此次英軍將領謂長城外係中國之領土。并將演習地點科目函知我國山海關特種公安局。其處置之正當。自爲世人所共見。然辛丑條約允許各國酌定數處留兵駐守。以保「京師」至海通道。使無斷絶之虞。其主要之用意蓋在保障東交民巷使館區域之安全以免復演拳亂時之故事耳。今我國人旣絶無絲毫盲目排外之意嚮與事實。而國都又已南遷於揚子江畔水陸交通之南京。所謂東交民巷之使館區域。實無繼續存在之意義。各國揆諸國際慣例及對華之友誼。皆有從速撤退駐軍之必要。固未可以不平等條約爲護符也。且中國蒙不平等條約之束縳者。垂八十有餘年。吾人雖痛心疾首於此無數之桎梏。然其求解放也。莫不出之以光明正大之手腕。在條約義務未解除前。始終忠實履行。而未嘗或渝。吾人所望於各友邦者。亦不過欲其忠實履行與我有關之條約義務而已。顧自九一八後。所謂國聯盟約。九國公約。與凱洛公約之衆締約國。皆相率規避。以自放棄其義務矣。結果則不平等條約之痛苦。我獨受。平等條約之實惠。我無與。實施不平等條約時。惟恐中國之滅亡。履行平等條約時。又藐視中國之存在。國際條約之眞面目竟至於此。凡我友邦之享受不平等條約權利者。其亦有所動於中乎。</p>
<p>美聯社遠東經理演說</p>
<h3>遠東戰爭成分居多</h3>
<p>日本武力及經濟侵略結果</p>
<p>美國夏羅資維爾美聯社前任遠東經理馮邁爾今日在時事年會演說、稱遠東時局、戰爭之成分甚多、而和平之傾向已漸漸泯滅、馮氏謂遠東之將來全恃最近四項局勢之發展、卽（一）日本之一手造成「滿洲國」、（二）英日商戰、（三）斐律濱獨立及其結果、（四）華盛頓海軍條約是也、</p>
<p>其最重要者爲「滿洲國」問題、此卽表示日本已决心在亞洲北部伸張勢力、日本人土咸稱此種伸張非屬土地侵略、然彼等皆不能否認其爲經濟侵略、且彼等亦不能否認日本經濟勢力每次向亞洲北部有何發展、輙以武力保持其所得之利益、卽以滿洲而論、日人仍稱、引用武力亦爲對於中國及滿洲當局完成其新成立之經濟恊定、日人以爲中國違背此種恊定、剥奪日人權利、然中國所以不願承認者、卽因此種恊定爲以武力所取得者耳、日本於是不顧一切、仍以武力驅除所謂「背信」之中國當局、而代以所謂「守信」之「滿洲國」、日本欲確使「滿洲國」守信、乃盡量使其軍政經濟各權皆由日人操縱、日本此種計劃在滿洲固非常成功、惟其能否在他處奏效、則爲另一問題、研究遠東問題者、皆以爲日本在西比利亞附近、海參崴及堪察加之處、亦將如法泡製、因日本對於該處之地位與滿洲略同、日本與蘇俄亦有恊定、卽日人得在蘇俄領海捕魚、日人曾屢稱、蘇俄背信、故一有機會、日本或將在西比利亞海濱省亦造成類於滿洲之獨立國家、日本當局固尚絶對否認、彼等謂日本在西比利亞之經濟關係遠不如滿洲之鉅、且日俄恊定、亦不如中日間對於滿洲恊定之重要、况歷史背景亦大不相同、日俄之戰係因滿洲問題而爆發、日本於一九一八年雖亦曾出兵西比利亞、然與日俄之戰相較究屬不倫、有人則以爲日本以此種計劃施諸蒙古、似較近情、蓋滿蒙邊境犬牙相錯、日本已屢屢設法、使蒙古王公贊助「滿洲國」之組織、現在已成立不少恊定、將來或可發生糾紛、日本方面亦斥爲純屬懸測之詞、彼等謂滿洲疆界將來自能劃清、而内外蒙古與蘇俄之關係亦自能解决、以現狀觀之、日俄决不能因蒙古而發生戰爭、且俄國儘可於日本發動之前、在蒙古效法日本、亦造成與俄國親善之國家、日本亦莫可如何也、</p>
<p>英日商戰問題、則爲歐戰及華府會議之結果、歐戰使日本一躍而爲一等工商業國家、華府會議復使英日聯盟解散、於是兩國遂成爲亞洲及世界市場之勁敵、日本因歐洲戰爭、各國無暇經營工商、遂大獲其利、且乘機振興工廠、擴充航業、故英國雖久佔亞洲棉織物市場、至此亦不能與日本競爭、卽在孟却斯德、英國棉織物之大本營、日本出品之價格、亦能較英貨爲低、英國最受損失之處爲印度、一九三一年、日貨幾佔印度市場、而使英貨毫無立足之地、英國於是宣布廢止印日商約、日本始允限制對印輸出、數經交涉、方得妥恊、日本稱英國不惜用種種方法、使日貨感受困難、卽國聯之不承認「滿洲國、」中國之抗日運動、亦皆有英國在幕後主動、故目下英日兩國在遠東方面頗有一觸卽發之勢一</p>
<p>斐律濱問題經美國准許獨立後、其結果頗可重視、現在中國已發生恐慌、因日本在太平洋代管各島、已將中國門户大半包圍、若加以斐島、則出路全無矣、美國退出斐島之後、日本進而佔領之、在華人心目中、已成必然之勢、日人現在斐島之經濟勢力、已大爲可觀、將來加以政治上之控制、卽成爲「滿洲國」第二而已、此說固因華人對日不滿而發、惟日本方面亦感受一種不安、彼等以爲斐島獨立之後、將使亞洲之現狀改變、而日本以北方問題、尚未解决、無暇兼顧、倘他國進而在斐島有何政治活動、日本何能坐視、且英荷兩國亦因其屬地與斐接近、深感此種獨力傾向有蔓延之患、故將來局勢殊難臆斷、若論華府會議之結果、現在猶未能完全定評、蓋日本方擬廢止現有海軍比率、至保障中國領土完整之九國公約、則華人方面以爲早被日本撕破、日本對此固絶對否認、其他國家亦並未放棄、然所謂公約、其實已等於廢紙、在此舉世風雲緊急經濟競爭日益加甚之時、亞洲弱小國家蓋盡有墜卵之危也、（八日國民電）</p>

<h3>日人統治下之僞組織現狀</h3>
<p>全滿僞軍概由日軍官指揮</p>
<p>國務顧問操一切政務實權</p>
<p>日人在東北勵行滅種敎育</p>
<p>北平特訊、客有自東北平來者、述及東北最近現况、兹詳記之如下、</p>
<h3>統治狀况</h3>
<p>傀儡漙儀稱「帝」後、僞組織之軍事·政務·迄今已完全操諸日人之手、</p>
<p>（甲）關於軍事方面者僞軍部乃最高軍事機關、除統轄全「滿」僞軍外、並轄有翔衛軍團部·海軍江防艦隊司令部·中央軍訓處·馬政局·靖安軍等、至僞組織全境之「滿」軍、均處於日軍環視之下、且軍官多爲日人、操其命令全權、俾無絲毫自由動作、其軍額計有二十六混成旅、每旅轄二團、每團轄三營、駐吉林者每團轄二營、總數約十餘萬人、而日軍之駐東北者、則奉天有一師團、吉林僞京有一師團、及憲兵兩團、黑龍江及北滿一帶有兩師團、熱河有一師團、總數亦共有十數萬人、且日軍之在鄕軍人、移民於東邊縣者、尚不止二十萬人、其目標蓋對俄也、僞軍所用槍械、新式者盡被日人没收、機槍大砲一無所有、奉天兵工廠規模之大、在我國當居首位、今已依日本計劃而作業、海軍亦只於江防艦隊新近建造五十噸砲艦二艘、十四噸砲艇四艘、卽日可以完成、至於僞國所有參加技術之建設、如軍事測量軍事地圖等類、均爲日「滿」恊定所訂明、歸日本擔任之、</p>
<p>（乙）政務方面、所有僞國各院部之組織、與漙儀任僞執政時代無異、不過總長易名大臣而已、至其畸形之處、（一）日人以國務顧問名義、把持僞國全局政務、現任國務顧問宇佐勝夫、卽以僞國總理大臣鄭孝胥之地位、其印章若不得字佐美同意、不能附署一國之政務、（二）於各機關設總務名義、以把持僞國行政全部之事務、（三）地方行政機關均設參事官、把持地方行政、所有東北各縣縣政、均由參事宜措施</p>
<h3>社會狀况</h3>
<p>（甲）交通事業、日本自佔領東北四省後、卽努力於管理交通、去歲成立僞國委託滿鐵經營旣成鐵路之契約、舉全境之奉山·瀋海·吉長·吉海·吉會·吉敦·洮昻·齊克·洮索·呼海九綫、盡以授諸日本、此外新由滿鐵趕修者、有敦化圖們間之敦圖綫、克山海倫間之海克綫、拉法至哈爾濱之拉濱綫、其他港灣水運、及一切附帶事業、亦均畀諸日人經營、</p>
<p>（乙）敎育事業東北四省學校、計小學一萬一千三百九十五所、中學一百九十所、職業學校六十七所、師範學校一百二十三所、最近更有新增者、今均滿布日人敎員、且多日人校長、課材注重日語、更羼雜其所謂王道主義、及日本之光榮史實等、以期忘我三千萬同胞之國民性、</p>
<p>（丙）農村狀况東北民衆十九爲冀魯兩省移墾之民、故農民實爲東北民衆之骨幹、「九一八」後、農民不堪日警及便衣探之壓迫蹂躪、同時因日鮮武力移民、不得不遷徙以避讓、</p>
<p>（丁）商業狀况東北業已爲日本獨有之市塲、各地日貨充斥、偶有西洋貨或俄國花標布煤油等、亦以稅重而價貴、不能與日貨競爭、國貨則除土布·吉林參·豬·羊·牛肉外、鷄鴨亦多由俄國運來、水菓如西瓜·桃杏·蘋菓·楷杷等、則由大連台灣運來、各地工廠概歸日人把持、中國人在東北之大商號、紛紛倒閉、故向日之繁榮大埠、亦漸蕭條、僅烟館·娼家·小飯館·尚稱發達、三者外則無商業之可言矣、（七日）</p>

<h3>籲撤老黃浦堤</h3>
<p>農會調查呈報經過</p>
<p>局批准撤農會負責</p>
<p>今夏以天時亢旱、災象已成、高橋區農民以田畝龜裂、秋收絶望、曾於日前發生自動拆毁濬浦局在老黃浦所築高堤之風潮、冀潮水灌入、俾蘇農田物産、大白社記者於得悉後、卽往各方探悉詳情、兹分誌如下、</p>
<h3>毁堤之原因</h3>
<p>據市農會負責人談本年亢旱以來、各區鄕民以滴水無着、曾紛紛請求市政當局及市農會、迅予救濟、當卽組織防旱會、並曾同社會工務兩局、實施救旱工作、並購大批抽水機、分配各鄕、又請濬浦局及各救火車帮同抽水、然所費旣大、收效極微、故旋卽停止、至沿海一帶、本可藉潮水高漲時、灌溉農田、惟自濬浦局興工築堤以來、潮水受阻、故高橋區農民、爲謀自救起見、乃出毁堤之舉、本市自得悉後、市黨部卽派張輝軍、社會局派田和卿、市農會派俞振輝、特前往調查眞象、以憑核辦、</p>
<h3>市農會呈報</h3>
<p>市農會呈社會局文云、呈爲呈報高橋區農民要求拆壩經過、仰祈鑒核事、竊本會前據高橋區農會報告、濬浦局在老黃浦築壩潮水被阻、戽水不足、以致支河乾涸當卽據情呈報救濟在案、蒙鈞局派員與濬浦局接洽、允自二日起、每晚戽水六小時乃該處農民、仍以戽水不足、於三日下午、羣至該區農會籌備員陸棟等家中責難、本會聞訊、於四日上午派員至鈞局及市府報告、並請迅予設法、日夜戽水、卽蒙鈞局及市府派員往濬浦局接洽、允於四日晚起、接連戽水六十小時、是日（四日）下午、後由鈞局派田主任和卿、會同本會前往調查、比至凌家宅附近、農民正在鳴鑼集衆、卽會同田主任善言勸導、乃各村農民、仍結隊而來、聲述自老黃浦築壩後、（七月二十二日晚、曾一度冲坍、後復修築、）潮水被阻、原冀濬浦局戽水、但每日祗二三小時、（并謂因欠汲之故、間有泥漿水混入河道、容易淤塞、於事無濟、祗老黃浦有水外、共他各支河均已乾涸并聞謡言浚浦局擬將老黃浦塡後出售、故已於上午前往將壩拆毁等語、其時農民愈聚愈衆一唱百和、擁至高橋鎭三區四分所、沿途指點河流乾涸、田禾枯萎情形、間右痛哭流涙者、情狀殊堪憐憫當會同詹所長善言勸導農民要求、（一）請將老黃浦所築之壩於三日内拆盡、以通潮水、（二）開浚河道、（三）救賑、（四）免糧、其時羣情激昻不得已與田主任詹所長會商結果、權允將要求各點、呈報市府核辦、始各散去、揚言如三日内仍不將壩拆去、擬再聚衆呼籲、當卽同田主任返滬、特將經過情形面陳、昨日（五日）仍會同田主任前往勸導、並督工裝置東海濱戽水機所有經過情形、理合備文呈報、仰祈鑒核、</p>

<p>颶風遠去</p>
<h3>昨日晴熱如常</h3>
<p>江海航輪恢復常態</p>
<p>太平洋颶風、自前日掠滬而過後、現正向北進行、昨向本埠天文台探詢、則稱清晨（昨日）六時報告、風抵北緯三十三度、東經一百二十四度、方向北北東轉向正北、但該台於午後二時、續接報告則風已抵北緯三十五度東經一百二十四度、方向北或北北、故預計該風午後二時、適在東海（卽海州）與朝鮮木浦間之黃海中、若不變方向、直向北吹、將在朝鮮與遼寗交界處安東登陸、至於外傳淞口外大戢山、昨晨尚有六個風力留滯、完全非確、同時對太平洋新發生一颶風、據該台稱、離陸尚遠、未接詳細報告、至昨日氣温、因前日颶風過境關係、驟降至八十一度四、但至昨又晴熱如常、最高爲九十四度八、最低爲七十五度九、似又恢復三日前狀態矣、至被阻各輪、昨已紛紛進口、恢復班期、兹分述如下</p>
<h3>順天進口又退原因</h3>
<p>太古公司老順天輪、自改航長江後、行駛漢口上海間赴南北洋各埠、八日該輪於午後二時到滬、船已進口、駛至楊樹浦、忽又折至吳淞口外、當時該公司不明原委、曾發電探詢、直至昨晨、順天又進口、據船員言、該輪在進口時、鑒浦江風大水激、一時欲靠停碼頭、異常困難、故又折回吳淞口外抛泊一宵、直至九日晨開滬</p>
<h3>避風各輪先後開駛</h3>
<p>招商局海瑞輪、從海州孫家山裝隴海路聯運貨、開出港口來滬、詎船方出海、卽遇颶風、該輪不敢行駛、立卽退回老窰、於今日再開、北洋正班新銘輪、途遇颶風、開入威海衛暫避、赴閩七海輪、被阻在吳淞者、昨日上午已盡行開出、至在吳淞口外避風之來滬船、昨已先後駛進浦江、幸事先防範、故此次颶風、並無失事、亦云幸矣、</p>
<h3>滬甬班輪停航一次</h3>
<p>寗波班内七日未開出、及出口後退回上海之寗興新江天等輪、昨已照常行駛、船内旅客、有一部未曾退票者、仍搭原輪赴甬、由寗波開來之新北京寗紹各輪、亦可於今晨駛回來滬、此次大風、滬甬班輪四分司、均停航一次、</p>

<h3>公會表示</h3>
<p>昨據車商公會負責人語新新社記者、謂前日車商代表與工部局負責人會議結果、車商方面純爲顧全大局、避免事態之擴大起見、忍痛接納各項辦法、而車租之减低、並由車商代繳互助救濟費等項、無不表示車商顧全大局救濟車夫之誠意、業經工部局董事會追認在案、詎今晨忽有所謂車夫代表鄭某某等請願反對工部局與車商代表决議辦法、並呼擁護麥西之口號等情、殊爲遺憾、查若輩自稱代表某某等、本身旣非車夫、又何從取得代表身份、殊令入費解、而前次人力車務管理委員會因恐舊車主拒絶領照、於是有召集新車主登記之舉、並經通告各登記人、遵章繳納互濟會費及保證金、如無照領則所繳證金發回等情、純爲假定凖備之意、詎近日市上竟有發現以該項通智書所定之輛數作價出售、欺詐愚矇、其投機奸詐、可以想見、今見工部局公告、以舊車主遵章領照、則新車主登記、將不生效力等情、於是投機未成、乃冐充車夫從事擾亂、而在中途被迫隨之同行之車輛、車夫在彼等威脅之下、均尚不明眞相與意義、且有數處竟發現有以暴力拔放橡皮輪空氣、禁止車夫營業之情事、危害營業、攪亂治安、實屬不法已極、倘長此以往則影響社會安寗、奚堪置料、本會除分别呈請警政機關嚴重調查依法澈究外、業蒙麥總巡通令各捕房拿獲爲首者多人、拘禁嚴辦、並經通告各車商將此種事件之眞相轉告全市車夫、俾不致受其利用云云、</p>

<p>受傷行人多不識字者</p>
<p>十分之九爲穿越馬路</p>
<p>工部局交通委員會日前開會時、曾詳細討論某董事所提增加保護界内街道上步行人之兩種辦法、卽（一）關於穿越街道或在街道上徘徊之危險、應在衝要地點廣爲揭示、（二）應仿照其他著名城市之辦法、劃定一種步行人穿越街道時之安全地帶、據警務處處長報告、在街道上遭逢意外事件而受傷之步行人、大都爲不識字者、故揭示危險之通告、是否有用、頗屬疑問、步行人之遭遇意外事件、非常在街道之交义處、乃由於車輛疾行之際、急圖超過其前、以穿越馬路、現時辦法、係由以演講爲業之宣講員、向民衆演講「行路宜先求安全」之法、大多數之重要馬路交义處、均有以黃漆爲記之步行道、但用之者頗少、至於築造安全站台一層、則以界内馬路類皆狹窄、加以主要通衢、如南京路及靜安寺路、均有電車軌道、殊無設置此項站台之餘地、嗣某委員詢據警務處處長答稱、步行人在街道上遭逢之意外事件、發生於不准横過馬路之地點者、大概占十分之九、另一委員言、使步行人在街道上遭遇意外事件之一切重要原因、旣尚無詳細調查、警務處處長之報告、當爲本案所提建議之唯一答覆、美國北都曾試令步行人、僅在所經指定地點、穿越街道、或聽從交通管理員之指揮而穿越、第以民衆對此辦法、未予合作、致無效果、上海之交通問題、實爲世界最難者之一、非將交通管理之全部問題、從種種方面澈底研究、斷不能採用枝枝節節之辦法、美國城市所有街道上之意外事件、均有分類及列表之詳細記錄、以便斷定其肇禍原因、深信美國城市之警務處、當樂將所用類别與分析街道上意外事件之辦法相告、關於此項辦法之消息、實於本埠交通管理問題之研究、大有裨益、案經討論後、委員會以爲警務處處長之報告、足爲某董事所擬辦法之答案、惟步行人交通問題、已日見重要、當仍由警務處處長隨時注意、</p>

<h3>傅筱庵訴嚴大覺律師</h3>
<p>嚴律師代理戴振武致函於傅</p>
<p>傅認爲有恐嚇意思訴諸法院</p>
<p>丨嚴律師對傅亦提起反訴丨</p>
<p>甬籍聞人傅筱庵、於民國十六年時、任中國通商銀行經理、嗣因政治關係、曾被國府通緝、故所遺通商經理一缺、由王心貫繼任、王之親戚日商戴生昌輪船公司小主戴振武又名繩祖、因代傅籌劃費用、故向通商銀行商借洋十一萬餘元、由戴簽立借劵、交王存庫、去年王心貫病殁後、傅亦得取消通緝令、故即回原任、傅乃於該行召集開董事會時、提出此項借劵、欲向戴訴追以前借欵、各董事雖</p>
<h3>不然其議</h3>
<p>而傅則主張頗力、并以戴係日商、故向日領事署起訴、戴當延日籍律師矢野信雄擬與傅交涉控訴、祗因矢野并未在中國法院註册登記、乃委粤籍律師嚴大覺爲複代理、致函傅筱庵、瀝述經過、限期答覆、否則起訴、該信於六月二十五日發出、迨傅接函後、認嚴律師不應共同恐嚇、即委戴成祥律師致函與嚴、嚴即囑戴振武提出</p>
<h3>相當證據</h3>
<p>戴即交出王心貫之信函照片一紙、并云通商銀行職員及滬上甬人、均知代傅偕欵之事、而傅即延戴律師具狀第一特院刑庭、控嚴大覺恐嚇罪、昨日下午四時餘、由劉毓桂推事開刑八庭傅訊、嚴延盛沛東律師投案、并當庭呈遞辯訴及提起反訴狀、自訴人傅筱庵未到、由戴律師陳述起訴要旨、謂嚴函内開之「董事會傅極力主張訴追該欵」、及一賠償名譽及金錢上損失、限五日明白答復、否則提起自訴」、兩點爲有</p>
<h3>恐嚇意思</h3>
<p>請求依法辦理、而被告嚴大覺亦詳述經過、謂查戴振武本將自訴傅筱庵之案件、委任在上海之日本律師矢野信雄辦理、矢野未經登錄、不能出席我國法庭、故將該案轉委辯訴人爲複代理人、辯訴人自接受此項複代理案件後、漸次詢明事實、擬代起訴、惟聞傅筱庵有相當地位之人、姑先根據事實去函、請其限日明白答覆、藉明兩造是非、或者有人調解、兩可息訟、迨將函稿擬就、仍交矢野看閱、得其同意、認爲與共所委託之意旨、不相違背、經其</p>
<h3>批記蓋章</h3>
<p>發還辯訴人、方始照繕寄去、其後直接與戴振武晤面、根據矢野表示之事實調查、所謂「三君有一函致本人」者、該函存在與否、戴振武則舉該函照片相示、辯訴人信爲事實不虚、着將照片交出、附入卷宗、以備作起訴事實之證據、自辯訴人繕寄之信去後、數日間、得接戴成祥律師代表傅筱庵復函、謂爲揑詞恐嚇、與嚴律師爲共犯、將分别對付云云、辯訴人隨即持函往詢矢野、矢野並以其戴振武向上海日本領事館提出</p>
<h3>民事答辯</h3>
<p>之凖備書面副本相示、以證確有其事、並非揑詞、而戴振武是時稱、有在外和解之說、囑辯訴人暫緩起訴、故已簽好名字之狀紙、至今仍擱置在辯訴人處、就此一段接案之事實而論、足證辯訴人辦理愼重、絶無當事人共同揑造事實可知、自訴人安可誣指辯訴人爲共犯恐嚇、基上辯訴、辯訴人旣絶對無與當事人戴振武揑造事實共犯恐嚇之嫌疑、而自訴人竟因辯訴人代理訴訟、遷怨傾陷、誣爲</p>
<h3>共犯恐嚇</h3>
<p>提起自訴於鈞院、意圖辯訴人受刑事處分、自應請求依照刑第一百八十條第一項、治以誣造之罪、并附帶民訴、請求判令賠償名譽損害、總上陳述、應請宣告辯訴人無罪、而治反訴被告以誣告之罪、並判令賠償名譽損害云云、劉推事核供、以本案被告旣已提起反訴、則依法反訴被告、亦應到案、乃諭本案改期八月十七號下午着自訴人傅筱庵到案再訊、諭畢退庭、時已薄暮矣、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>續「翻譯本的錯誤和疑難」（冉續）</h3>
<p>丨答杜洛基君丨</p>
<p>問，「資本主義體系的衰退，並不是由於那種體系之内的法則發生，而必須是勞働階級之有意識的工作。」末句未明。</p>
<p>答，這句譯筆與原文少有不同，原文應譯作：「資本主義體系的衰退，並不是由於那種體系之内的法則發生，而必須是勞働階級的意思的有意識的工作。希爾佛丁把勞働階級的意思，以及他們的有意識的行動從資本主義的矛盾和階級鬥爭分離開了。」「勞働階級的意思的有意識的工作」意即不是社會矛盾所必然地引起的，而是勞働階級依自已的意思、意地做出來的事。</p>
<p>問，「……牠有要求分佔空想的獅子的不變的神權，」請予解釋。</p>
<p>答，這句話應譯作：「牠有要求分肥空想的不變的神權」原譯本是譯錯了。「要求分佔空想的獅子」一語直譯應作：「要求空想的獅子的份兒。」「獅子的份兒」意即獅子所能搶到的食物，獅子所搶到的當然是很大的，所以也可以意譯作「分肥」，這句話再譯得通俗一點，就可以寫作「……牠自始至終有一大部分是空想」。</p>
<p>問，一九七頁九行至十二行這一段馬克斯批評費爾巴赫的話，十分不明。</p>
<p>答，這句話表示費爾巴赫只能在每一時代裏看見每一時代時事物，而不懂得一時代和另一時代中問的發展關聯。</p>
<p>問，「……不向着用政治上法令的内容充滿抽象的思維這個方面，而是向着發散現存政治上法令的内容而把牠作爲抽象的思維那個方面。」兩個方面可否通俗點講一講。（未完）</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於青年底就業問題</h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>在全世界都閙着失業恐慌的不景氣中，自然青年底就業是很成爲問題的。這問題，毫無疑義地，主要的重心并不在青年之願就與否，而是在根本就無業可就。所以，我們對於這問題的考察只能從客觀上去找它底原因，而不能從青年底本身上去找。然而近來却有一些人不把這問題當作一個嚴重的社會問題，而只認爲是由於青年底不自覺所釀出的現象，並對於青年加以責備。譬如說，我們的尢墨君先生就是一個。</p>
<p>尢先生前天（八月六日）在「自由談」上發表一篇呌做「青年就業問題」的文章，開頭就這樣地說：「青年究竟有没有出路？這問題，粗看之似頗不易解答。因爲從理論方面講，這可以牽涉到社會病態，地主榨迫，農村經濟崩潰等大問題。如果再說得擴大些，這還可以推廣到列强經濟侵略，世界的不景氣，帝國主義者的没落等嚴重話頭。可是抛棄理論來談事實，我覺得青年的出路問題，並没有像上述的那般嚴重。他們究竟有没有出路，其關鍵完全在青年的本身；換句話說，這完全在他們的能否自覺。」接着還引了幾個例子證明青年之所以失業完全是由於他們「不願屈就」，「情願把事情回掉」，證明「他們明明前面有一條路可出而他們偏不肯出」。最後，並肯定地下了一個結論：「所以，青年究意有没有出路？這個問題，我敢引事實證明道：他們並不能說没有出路，只是他們走錯了方向。」</p>
<p>尢先生底意思很明白：只要一般青年能够刻苦些，不「想着物質上的舒服或報酬的厚薄」，無論什麽業都願意就便不至於失業了，如果將就尢先生所舉的例子來說，只要中學畢業生不想做郵務員，洋行買辦，銀行主任以及什麽科長專員等，中學畢業生不想做一任官，而願屈就按月報酬二十二元的小學敎師乃至於肩挑手提的苦力，自然社會上的失業者就日見其少了。然而，尢先生却没有顧到社會上並不缺乏按月報酬二十二元乃至以下的小學敎師和肩挑手提的苦力，而且也是一樣的擁擠和閙着失業恐慌呢。卽使一般青年學生都依着尢先生指出的路走去，那結果無非是將另一部分，少有機會受敎育没有取得較高地位的在業的人擠出變成失業者使彼此掉換了一個地位。難道這就算是青年有了出路嗎？難道那些没有受過中等以上的敎育的青年就不要出路嗎？難道他們底廣大的失業就不成爲問題嗎？</p>
<p>中國人素來是主張以勤儉立身的，又加上尢先生本身就處在一般中學以上的學生之間，所以只爲了一般中學畢業以上的青年想出了這樣一條出路。這本來也不足怪。我們但希望尢先生偷閒鍍出學生所環繞成的圈子一步伸開眼光去看看學生以外的東西，看看青年底失業或有没有出路的問題究竟在「事實」上是不是「可以牽涉到社會病態，地主榨迫，農村經濟崩潰等大問題」而且「還可以推廣到列强經濟侵略，世界的不景氣，帝國主義者的没落等話頭」，不要讓身邊的青年學生將自已底眼隔斷了。退一步說，尢先生至少應該超過自已所引出來作爲例證的一點點事實看看最近北平各大學畢業生、職業運動底發生代表了一種什麽意義。</p>
<h3>淄博印象</h3>
<p>— 羅王</p>
<p>（七）亮眼瞎子</p>
<p>礦工的結局，常屬於「自掛東南枝」！但是從另方面去尋找，還有一種料貨工人！吹玻璃的工人！他們的下塲，常變成了亮眼瞎子的乞丐！</p>
<p>前面已經報告過，博山的出産，除了煤以外，其次就要輪到「博山玻璃」及「博山料貨」了。</p>
<p>的確，博山的玻璃，玻璃絲鏡及料貨，刻工的精細，色彩的鮮明，足以壓倒西洋貨物！從前德國人來此遊歷，把博山貨買了去，當古玩欣賞！一對花瓶，價錢常到百元，五十元，三十元。洋大人有的是錢！博山商人發了很多的洋財！</p>
<p>有許多玻璃與琉璃品，多賴工人吹製的！於是這種工人應着貨物的需要，加倍的趕工，每日呼吸於熱火爐邊，目光只注意於所吹之物！積久以還，數十年的光隂，都消磨在熔火爐的旁邊，於是目光漸漸地近視起來了！終於成了白眼！非光度極强的東西，便看不清楚！更爲了兩眼受傷，到了老年，便成了亮眼瞎了！無工可做，無飯可吃，結果便只好流爲乞丐了！</p>
<p>自從東北事變以後，博山料貨銷路小了！因此，工人使用也較少，爐也不時時開了！這樣，似乎救了很多工人的眼睛！然而，另一方面的問題，便接踵而來了丨丨那就是玻璃工人的失業與工資的降低！這種現象，在許多年老的博山人，統能道出！滄桑變化，眞足令人興嘆啊！</p>
<h3>舊貨新談</h3>
<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>丨從歷史上看大衆語文學丨</p>
<p>任憑你的廣告說得好，没有貨色給人看、立刻就證明了你的價廉物美的話，原是謊言胡說丨這是誰也會說的話。</p>
<p>「拿貨色來！」這一句話，就可以塞住空口誇貨色的人那把嘴巴。</p>
<p>你提倡大衆語麽？你贊成建設大衆語文學麽？就請你給我們一點大衆語的東西看看。這要求原來不算怎麽過分的。丨不過這有點像看見了、隻鷄蛋，就把牠當做雄鷄，希望牠喔喔地報曉，未免性急。其實大衆，就是大衆，不是天上掉下的神仙，只要你有耳朶你就可以聽到大衆的聲音；只要你有眼睛，你就可以看見大衆的面目。每日和你接觸的人，發生交涉的人，不都是大衆麽？你自已也是大衆裏面的一份子，只要你算得是一個人。這樣說來，大衆語就是大衆的語言，那還待說麽？大衆說得出，聽得懂，寫得來，看得下，又能够代表大衆進步的意識，像這樣的語言文字，呌做大衆語，那個說不應當呢？古文不合這個標凖，當然不是大衆語。白話是不是大衆語？這就要分别來說了。</p>
<p>先說古白話文：</p>
<p>古白話文如今存在的，應該從唐朝五代的變文，宋朝的平話說起。唐宋的大衆語究竟怎麽樣？我們還不很知道。那時的變文平話旣由說書的人說出，大衆又聽得懂，我們就認這是那時的大衆語，不算怎麽錯的。</p>
<p>其次講到詩。唐初和尚王梵志寒山子的詩採用白話，都很流行民間。王梵志的詩有唐人寫本，三十年前從敦煌石室裏發見了。寒山子的詩自已題在巖石，人家把牠寫在廳壁。他們用大衆的語言做詩，宣傳他們從佛家得來的人生哲學。這類詩所以能够在民間流行，因爲牠像格言，可以從裏面得到些敎訓；要不是接近大衆的白話，敎訓雖好，也没有人理會的。只要是接近大衆的白話，又能够抓住大衆的心理，迎合大衆的趣味，雖然没有敎訓，甚至相反，不可做敎訓，還是能够流行民間的。在王梵志寒山子稍前一點時候，北齊陽俊之做了許多六言詩歌，據說是很淫蕩的，又很淺俗的，流行民間，名呌「陽五伴侣」。有人鈔寫這種歌曲出賣，到處市塲都有有一次，陽俊之從一處市塲經過，看見這種歌曲的寫本，裏面有錯字，他想替賣這種寫本的人改正。那賣寫本的道：「陽五是古代賢人，他做的這種伴侣曲，豈有錯的？你知道什麽，敢亂發議論麽？」可惜陽五伴侣那種歌曲不傳，不然的話，我們倒可以看看一千九百年前的黎錦暉的調調兒。目前黎錦暉先生的歌曲所以到處流行，不還是靠了淺俗淫蕩兩個要素麽？這種歌曲雖說用的是接近大衆的語言，内容却止迎合了大衆的低級趣味，不曾代表大衆的進步思想，隔理想的大衆語歌曲還是很遠的。總之，無論陽五伴侣也好，王梵志寒山子的詩也好，丢開内容不說，他們肯和同時的文人作對，偏偏要用當日大衆的口頭語寫作，這也是難能可貴的了。</p>
<p>說到使用大衆語的詩人，我們就會想到中唐時候的白居易。相傳他做一首詩唸給老嫗聽，要老嫗都聽得懂，他纔滿意的。他的新樂府十分同情於當時的勞動階級，痛駡貴族官僚丨統治階級的掠奪，苛暴。他做這種詩，自已定下了四個原則，第一個原則是呌人讀了容易懂。第二個原則是呌人讀了感動驚醒。第三個原則是題材用現實的材料，當前政治上社會上的問題，呌人讀了相信他說的眞實。第四個原則是便於作歌曲，配音樂。原來他以爲詩這東西，必須具備語言，情感，思想，聲韻四個根本要素的，所以他纔定下了這寫詩的四個原則。果然，他的詩成功了，得到詩的最大的效果，就在他的生前。他看見從長安到江西三四千里，到處都題他的詩，逢人都詠他的詩，有寫他的詩賣錢的，贈人的。從都市到鄕村，從王公大人到牛童馬卒，都有能够哼他的詩的。可以想見他的詩流行到怎樣　廣了！當時元顧和他是好朋友，劉禹錫也和他是好朋友，他們的詩格差不多。肯使用平常的白話作詩，敢作諷剌當局的詩，能倣傚民間歌謡的形式作詩，這是當時白居易一派詩的特色。總之。他們是歡喜用大衆的語言，寫大衆的生活而作詩，大衆也歡喜讀他們的詩，或歌唱他們的詩，他們眞可以說是那一時代最偉大的大衆詩人了。</p>
<h3>我來自東（十九）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>夜中馬路兩旁，堆滿了毫無事情的閒人，他們口中依舊哼着毛毛雨一類的歌辭。店舖門口，掛着千奇百怪的招牌，電燈下有三三兩兩的店員，靠在門上，無目的地望着街心，他們的靠法也眞特别：腹部突出來，頭頸低下去，有時右足交在左足後面。說話或唱歌之時，用下巴動着。有的還唱得摇起頭來。他們的身體大半是瘦小的，長衫垂在身上，身體成爲一條蘆管。這些一切，在我三年不見以後，更奇特的引起我的注意。</p>
<p>旅館裏聞到的是很剌鼻的鴉片烟味。隔室有人打牌，半夜中還有人吵架。上海人吵架的本領眞大，好像駡人的話已經預備好在舌子底下，舌子一放，像自來水的龍頭開後的源源不絶。我想干涉他們，我又怕自已挨駡。從高樓下望馬路，滿眼依舊是人。他們走得很慢，兩手有點像風車一樣的摇來蕩去。</p>
<p>三年前的黃包車夫，一樣的屈身向前急跑，三年前的印度阿三們，一樣的左手右手伸來屈去。北四川路雖變了面目，北四川路的空氣依舊一樣。我們在新亞吃了夜飯，愛弄花樣的廣東人，拿出不知名的菜單來；我們吃過什麽「藍田種玉」，「碧玉西施」，還不知道西施是什麽做成的。我們中國人吃東西眞是講究，只是對於吃了以後怎樣，不很注意。</p>
<p>上海已經放在我的面前，中國已經放在我的眼下，我馬上要開始我的新的冒險。在這世界大激變的中心點，我可以看見前面的危險，偉大，激烈，幻變，紛亂，熱烈，慘酷。我默默的向着窗外，看那滿天的黯黯不明的星光，幻想着五年間十年間的自已和中國。（完）</p>
<h3>邊地夜記（中）</h3>
<p>— 吴嚴</p>
<p>門開了，老婆子那張猶有驚怖的臉，便在昏黃的菜油燈光裏面，帶着可憐的氣色，現了出來。剛才說話的男子却没有看見，單聽他同老婆子說話的語氣推測起來，他也只能算是一個陌生的客人罷了。隨卽想着，他是做什麽的呢？</p>
<p>老婆子看我確實是個善良的人吧，便略略用手撫撫胸口，對着正壁上的一張畫的觀音大士神像，揚着感謝的眼色。</p>
<p>剛剛坐定，在木盆子内洗我的足，門尚未關好，便有一位保商隊的弟兄鑽了進來，後腦上掛着軍帽，手裏提着一枝洋槍，開口就粗暴地喊道：</p>
<p>「老傢伙，借一床被單來用用，快點快點！」</p>
<p>老婆子驚嚇得說不出話來，就將身子退後緊依靠在泥壁上面。</p>
<p>這位不客氣的弟兄，便在屋裏亂找東西，放在觀音菩薩面前的一小盤苦荍巴，也統給他抓去塞進嘴裏。</p>
<p>「呵呀，那是獻菩薩的呀！」</p>
<p>老婆子氣促地呌了一聲，一雙枯籐似的老手，舉起來亂搔着頭髮。</p>
<p>「獻菩薩的？好，讓我這位活菩薩吃吧！」</p>
<p>他一面吃着苦荍巴，一面向老婆子打趣，同時足不停地在屋裏走着，眼珠子向屋角落裏直是溜。</p>
<p>不知怎的，忽然他在裏面的屋内，同人吵閙起來了，對手的口音，是屬於剛才我在門口聽見的那個男子的。</p>
<p>我坐着不動，只是洗我的足，聽見那個男子在裏面說，似乎還在跌足的光景。</p>
<p>「人家老媽媽只有這一塊哪，只有這一塊哪…」</p>
<p>「老傢伙，你要動手麽？好丨丨來！」</p>
<p>拍，鄕了一聲尖脆的耳光，接着那男子大聲地嚎呌起來。</p>
<p>「哪，你敢亂打人嗎？認清楚！認清楚！我不是鄕壩老！…」</p>
<p>「呵呀，天爺爺，天爺爺！」</p>
<p>同時，老婆子也在沙聲沙氣哭呌着。</p>
<p>我趕緊胡亂地把帶水的足穿進草鞋去，還没有繫好絆結，就連忙跑進去看，想儘可能地作作勸解的義務。</p>
<p>這時，那男子已經同保商隊的弟兄扭着出來了，他的年紀不上四十歲，但鬍鬚却已留得很長了，連耳邊的頭髮也作爲鬍子的一部份地保存着，因此，他的樣子，就更顯得莊嚴，假若穿上法衣，那是很像一個老道的。他氣得像在吹鬍子似呌着：</p>
<p>「去見隊長，去見隊長！」</p>

<p>這一點問清楚之後，接着伊又發出了許多的命令，打發那些太監去用心佈置那車壁上所吊着的許多古玩玉器；大概是伊對於我們所用的陳列方法，兀是不能認爲滿意，故不惜自出心裁，再把安們來重新陳列一番，及至變更妥當，伊自已看看也覺得無可疵議了，才下令開車。除掉這些古玩玉器之外，伊對於其他的一切裝設佈置，如壁畫窗簾，花瓶，地氈等等，都表示十二分的合意，因此伊的精神也較往日格外興奮一些。伊那時候的年紀雖然已將到七十，但伊一上了車之後，便滿臉都現着得意的笑容，指東話西的高興得眞像一個七八歲的小孩子拿到了一件新的玩具一樣。而其中最使伊感覺到極度的得意的一點，便是在這列御用火車上，皇太后的權威的顯露，尤比别處來得清楚，影響也特别的迅捷；伊只要低聲地哼一句，整列的火車，就會前進，後退，或停止了。同時，伊這一座小朝廷又可絶不費力的在伊所統治着的土地上隨意移動，這在那時候的人的目光中看來，的確可算是一椿萬分得意的事情！</p>
<p>當我未曾進宫以前，不但在外國已經坐過了無數次的火車，便是在自已國内，也曾搭過好幾次火車，都不覺得有什麽異樣的感觸；惟有這一次的旅行，却使我從最初的一刹那起，便是在準備的時候丨就懷了一重極緊張的情緒，自始至終，老是緊握着兩大把的冷汗，惟恐有什麽意外的禍事要發生。因爲太后根本没有見過火車，也許火車的種種行動，對於伊不免有些不愜意的地方，這樣，路上便不用想平安無事了！尤其使我担心的便是那火車初開時的一震，這一震對於别人，當然决無影響，可是對於太后，就不能說了。（一○二）</p>
<h3>老茶客的幽默</h3>
<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>吃板茶，是我們蘇州人的特長，說幽默話，也是我們蘇州人的特長。有人說：「吃了三年板茶，不會幽默的也會幽默。這兩句話是不錯的，凡有吃板茶資格的先生們，大抵坐性是很好的，或者含着捲烟，抽了一支又一支，或者，潑落潑落地抽那上海所不經見而春秋</p>
<p>内地依然流行的水烟，抽了一筒又一筒，一副幽閒冷靜的面孔，喜聽人家談論，而自已不大開口，偶一開口，總含有調侃人的口吻，這般口吻，在晋朝，呌做清談，在現代，呌做幽默。</p>
<p>小子是個喜動不喜靜的青年，當然够不上吃板茶，偶在休假餘閒，約了同學到茶寮裏喝一碗茶，總是互相笑謔，没有片時停過口。吃板茶的老先生，便替我們上了一個徽號，說我們是「燈草少年」。小子想到一句俗語，呌做：「燈草做不得拄拐。」便去請問老先生：「你說我們是燈草少年，可是譏笑我們是個不能支撑重住的没用少年？」老先生彈了一彈紙吹，徐徐的說道：「這倒未必，我所說的是「登吵少年」，你們登到那裏，吵到那裏，不是登吵少年麽？」</p>
<p>又有一天，小子在茶寮裏偶然談起：「恰見外面一輩吃講茶的，碰桌拍凳，甚至遷怒到茶壺，一拳打去，打斷了一張茶壺嘴。」小子談得起勁時，這位老先生接着冷嘴道：「怎說是遷怒，理該敲去茶壺上的一張嘴。」小子忍俊不禁，便去請問其故。老先生抽完了一筒皮絲鼻孔中放出兩條白烟，徐徐的說道：「只爲這張嘴太會說，太會吵了，所以理該敲去。」</p>
<p>小子受了老先生的兩番奚落，他是一位前輩先生，不能和他搶白。從此以後，小子存着戒心，便不敢在這家茶肆中去喝茶。</p>
<h3>嶺南鎭海樓</h3>
<p>— 慶霖</p>
<p>廣東省會之東北偏，有街曰「大石，」昔爲絃歌薈萃之區，今則更名粤秀馬路。街西有山，卽曰粤秀，亦名白雲，俗稱觀音山，山半有觀音祠，則善男信女頂香禮佛處也。惟山在城内，頗屬僅見，且於巍峨雄壯中，極挺拔雋秀之致。洪憲稱帝，龍濟光雄據嶺表，臣服北庭，殆革命軍出師夾攻，始遁走瓊崖。然而孤懸海外，猶復割據經年。初李恊和率方聲濤張開儒兩軍攻粤，龍濟光尚不肯遽舍地盤，悉索敝賦，負隅頑抗。卽在白雲上建設砲壘，并築飛橋，直達其督署。而建築之堅固，與設備之完美，洵爲戰術上最偉大之防禦工程，迄今遺跡猶在。陳濟棠且師其故智擴而充之。故今日之廣州，四郊咸有砲壘也。</p>
<p>白雲山巓有崇樓，高聳霄漢，粤人咸以「五層樓」稱之，厥名實曰「鎭海樓」，數千年前古代建築物也。考係漢越王趙佗所建造。春秋佳日，遊人登臨最上層，俯瞰全城物景，都在眼底，遥望珠江，帆檣林立。而虎門砲臺，襟山帶海，亦依稀可見。相傳歷代以來，雖未廢修葺，但其基礎至固，不稍動摇，壁垣磚瓦，自更不容其剥蝕，可相當日鳩工之精，及取材之良矣。樓身全部棟梁，概爲上等楠樹，正柱係四方形，大可合抱，計共四座，分立於東南西北四隅。按我國舊式建築，重心端賴於柱。且此爲五層高樓，柱力苟稍弱，必不能勝任。前清末年，嘗一度不戒於火，幾肇焚如。守樓者欲圖諉過，謂爲天火，迷信者附和之，更妄加枝葉，遂播爲種種荒誕不經之語。顧此巨柱，竟灼傷其一，則殊可惜耳！憶兒時在粤，休浴日輙喜登臨，今已二十年未返故鄕。偶讀漢高之「大風起兮雲飛揚」之句，不禁悠然神往焉！</p>
<p>送行者道：我希望你們回來時把我的病能够醫好。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娱將軍終日樂老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>只走到二門邊，却見甘積之和一個穿白衣服的女看護在那裏說話。自已正是一楞，那女看護却先呌道：趙太太，你來瞧誰呀。他一發聲，桂枝就認出來了，正是黃曼英，不知道怎麽也跑到這種地方當看護來了。便點着頭道：久違了。同時，他也掉轉頭，向積之點了個頭。積之臉上紅着，例好像有好些不好意思。但是他立刻覺得這地方是如何嚴肅的所在，那能够作兒女子態，就板了臉道：趙太太你是來看殷連長探問趙連長下落的嗎？桂枝道：是的。可是田連長關連長都……他說不下去，嗓子一硬，便咽住了。積之道：我在這裏面當書記，我佩服殷連長這種人，和他談了好幾回的話，知道戰塲上的情形，你也不必悲傷，趙連長……他不曾說完，黃曼英連向他丢了兩個眼色，積之只好把話從中來忍住了。桂枝早已看得清楚便問道：他…他…是陣亡了。曼英道：你不必着急，讓我引你到裏面休息室裏去坐坐，再讓積之引你去和殷連長面談。無論如何，你自已也得保重。說着，就伸了手來攙扶他。當他伸過手來時，桂枝就看到他手上帶了一個訂婚戒指。立刻向積之手上看時，也有這樣一個，心裏想着，這個時候，自已是夫妻永别，人家是夫妻團圓，相形之下，更是呌人十分難過了。恰是新到了一批重傷的傷兵，用擔架床抬着，一架一架的向醫院裏抬去。由這裏更想到趙自强是如何一種情形，他心裏萬分凄楚，又不能哭出聲來，於是昏暈着向下一倒，幸喜積之眼快手快，立刻將他扶住·在他這樣途窮日暮的時候，總也算是倒入了愛人的懷抱。可是軍國主義的人，一定這樣說：戰士之妻，這樣的結果，那是很平常的了。（四五三）（全書完）</p>
<h3>典當</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>銀行裏，雖然也收着抵押品，做着放欵的買賣，但是向銀行做押欵者，非手裏有方單，道契，股票，公債，或高貴的飾物，如金鋼鑽之類，便休想問津。所以在上海，銀行，雖然外國的，中國的，大的，小的，式式俱備，而且多得數不清，可是對宇望衡，鱗次櫛比的典當，押當，雖然利息比了銀行高，生意却老是那麽的發達。</p>
<p>典當，雖然也收着抵押品，做着放欵的買賣，但是典當比了銀行，是平民化得多了，在典當裏，甚麽都可以當。金戒指，象牙筷，可以當抵，長袍短袿，甚至單短褂袴之類，一樣的認爲是良好的抵押品。一百二百塊錢的東西，可以當抵，三角五角的東西，也可以送到白粉墻裏的高櫃檯上去押一下子。聽說在灤東一帶，某國人開的典當裏，還收當活人。這種事情，果然也是典當業有史以來的新紀錄，但是收當餛飩担，冷麵攤的，在上海，是很平常的。總之，凡是值幾個大錢，而不是毫無所用的廢物，典當裏是没有不收當的。</p>
<p>因此，一般人都把典當呼作了「娘舅家」，是緩急可以通商一下的意思。雖然典當的利息，至少一分八，小押當有高至三分的，但這並不是重利盤剥，實在是所以便民的。所以典當，老是處於「娘舅家」的地位。</p>

<h3>人中寳（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>患者被施手術，未覺一些痛苦，匝月而愈，曩有華陀，未嘗深信，今見先生，始信神乎其技者，世固有人也，感佩之餘，爰述經過，以告同病，并誌不忘」！此事距今已閱五年，予所用之保存液，初爲水楊酸，不能耐久，後改硼酸甘油，直至今日，仍完好如初。曾經四十餘種之試騐，俱不能化，内惟輕養化鉀，微能溶解，因念輕養化鉀，不能入口，可入口者惟重炭酸鉀，因以重炭酸鉀製爲溶液，投入癖石，復加葡萄酸少許，則見立起沸騰，癖石因而活動，頗見消瘦，取出以化學天秤權之，减重百分之三，再如上法施行一次，亦减百分之三，共試三十四次，居然化凈無餘。由此而知重炭酸鉀，實爲對症藥物，並不難服，其味鹹而略澀，服量可自五分以至一錢，水三分能溶一分惟葡萄則味極酸，不能下嚥，因念胃中本是有酸，但飲葡萄釀可矣。因以試管先貯稀鹽酸以仿胃酸，加葡萄釀少許，投入癖石，此際不起作用，及加入重炭酸鉀，即起沸騰，而消化較速，更進一步，試取物類相感之義，即以癖石爲引，磋粉少許與重炭酸鉀混合，貯入膠囊中，仍如上法假設胃酸，加葡萄釀後，投入膠囊，加熱至攝氏三十七度，居然消化甚速，僅十四次已能化凈，於是豁然貫通，决定可治同樣之疾，顧無此病之人，足供試騐。壬申九月，適有舍親顧君之女，醫師斷爲胃癌，非割不治，顧又不敢嘗試，及旣决赴醫院開刀，女則號泣寗死不願，姑以試之，女本善飲，因以葡萄釀加酸，供其常飲，日服三次，每次約容二兩，佐以上述之膠囊，每次三枚，一枚之量，爲一公分，服後少頃，即發噯氣，胸胃大覺鬆爽，而小便甚多，恐其導入膀胱或變石淋，乃用人工加爾爾斯泉鹽方式，改重炭酸鈉爲鉀導入大腸，由糞便排洩，頗見順利，日漸就痊，因其回里掃墓，乞去一月之量，賀年信來，竟謂早已全愈，迄未復發，日飲葡萄釀三盞，胃納亦健，今其人已嫁，且有子矣，强健愈常，終年無病，蓋其效在葡萄含鐵能補血也。所用癖石之量甚微，統計全量不過九十公分而已。若以馬寶比例，則藥肆售價每分兩元，每一公分需五元有奇，亦可觀矣，然以住院開刀爲比，則仲媳醫費，乃至千元以上，家人則受驚恐以及提心吊膽護持調養至半年之久，其代價蓋尤不可計也。汪君謂爲人寶，雖爲理想之談，然以事實證之，顧女得此，賴以不死，殆眞可謂活人之寶，本草原有人中黃人中白等，然則稱之爲人中寶，亦固宜歟？</p>

<p>本棉反見下落</p>
<p>美棉政府估計發表九、一九三、○○○包、此種數量、於私人估計、相差不遠、故市氣尚平、漲四十五磅音、而匯兌放長、致本埠人心未能激起、且大孚·源大兩號、連日大量的抛出、檯面已鬆動、而紗市反動回落、棉市亦帶動下游、就美棉狀况論之、市價尚難看小、不過國内在新花漸次登塲之際、空方較爲安定耳、</p>
<h3>鄭標回跌六角</h3>
<p>標棉晨間開盤、美棉估計雖利於多頭、而漲四十五磅音、然匯兌連長兩日、前昨兩日、上海棉市已漲起八·九角、且大孚·源大兩號大量的抛出、以致檯面上鬆懈、人心不但未能激動而漲、反趨下落、同時紗市反動回跌、棉市愈弱、本月份以存貨充足、形勢尤虚、遠月受其牽制、市盤由此徐徐而下、結果各月跌五角至七角半、成交總計十九萬五千二百擔、查賣出愼昌二萬五千五百擔、吉豐八千擔、大孚四千九百擔、通記五千六百擔、裕大二千三百擔、大豐七千四百擔、惠康九千二百擔、元德四千六百擔、元一六千三百擔、長豐二千八百擔、潤康四千擔、新亨三千三百擔、源興昌四千五百擔、買進梅記三千一百擔、恒益二千八百擔、達記二千一百擔、源大四千四百擔、賡豐七千四百擔、瑞大四千八百擔、均昶三千七百擔、同豐四千三百擔、愼記三千五百擔、仁豐八千六百擔、泰昌三千六百擔、大昶一萬一千八百擔、恊生二千五百擔、同和三千五百擔、信誠四千六百擔、長和九千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食轉變中之期粉麥</h3>
<p>廠抛覱多齊起前市突小</p>
<p>新買補空又現午後回頭</p>
<p>粉昨日洋麥又漲二三四角、但粉市塲上人心已平、津電報小三分、故上午客囤停收、各廠大批售出、價乃突小六七分、下午忽被新買與補空趁小收吸、市又突升七八分、最後收市價本月小三分、下月十一月各小半分、十月不動、十二月大七五、一月續漲一分二五、各廠現粉均照標價直抽、存粉不足、出現須十四五天以後方有裝到、</p>
<p>麥昨小麥現貨漲至四元半、行廠嫌大、成交不多、比前日又漲一角、貨主仍在望好也、期麥上午突落一角三四分至二角二分、因人心定、多頭回出、下午突升一角七八分、又因爲新囤户與補空者吸收、收市價本月仍大二分、下月小四分、十月小七分、十一月小三分、十二月小一分、一月始終未開、標麥證金分四百·五百六百·八百四級、係照市價高低計算、即四元二角内、四元二角至四元四角、四元四角至四元六角、四元六角以上等四級、</p>
<h3>洋客秈囤户出籠</h3>
<p>回小一二角</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈因日前天雨、人心已定、大囤户已經賺錢、紛紛售出、故上午開市後各米一律平落、但江西邦與北洋帮辦胃仍貪、立即趁小收買、午刻又一度轉好、市面雖好、而囤户續有出售、且洋米定貨將相繼抵埠、新近兜售者又健、結果小絞小二角、各秈小角外也、全日由本街内地辦去機　糙各秈二千三四百包、江西北洋兩帮則分去小絞米五千包云、</p>
<h3>河下米銷路呆滯</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源因天氣轉晴、所阻船隻悉已抵埠、共有四十餘號、（貨約六千餘石、）而銷塲本街方面仍呆、如各厚粳做開者殊稀、行情跌落三四角、惟各帮晚稻幸青島帮續去一千餘包、故市色較爲站定、但客意都屬選辦特别貨、致大市亦軟二角許、回顧大局、照本街胃口全無、其基地殊見虚浮、若欲專賴包胃、已屬不可能、况青島帮去路猶屬短期、故推測在後數朝内、仍乏美觀、杜洋尖際此疲檔小去角餘、隂變元以到貨轉湧、銷路反呆、價同落二三角、浦東新粳仍開十一元二角、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十餘號、各色去胃寥寥、市情白粳羊尖價小一二角、白元明定暗疲、薄稻價疲近角、杜尖小角外、其餘帶疲勢、東新粳仍無上落、</p>
<h3>油豆漲風銷歇</h3>
<p>昨油豆市塲中之漲風、一致歛縮、實以粉麥趨跌、油豆凖備亦跌、故人心不立、且油市得連電報跌一元、一般購户無需求交易、市居擯局、黃豆新陳俱跌、陳豆廠家不動、祗本街零里去化、賣方加入囤户出檔、所以市跌一角四五分、成交車輪各豆五六車、新豆惟漢口六月白貨少市緊外、九江城門豆比前日跌一角、計交易六月白七十包、價開四元八角、城門豆開六百包、價爲四元四角至三角半、</p>
<h3>證劵債市仍未見起色</h3>
<p>各項小五分至三角半</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市價仍未有起色、交易則頗有增加、大户買賣均頗熱閙、市價仍係被高壓所制止、未能振作、論環境、如金融界要求對於銀行儲蓄章程之修改、財部已有明文、碍難變通、是則必有鉅額債劵、封存不能挪動、市上籌碼、必有感覺缺乏之一日、惟以浮多仍有大數出籠、雖不乏大户乘機吸收、終以賣氣爲盛而見疲、預測前途、當不致過小、昨日經過、開盤編遣裁兵好起五分至二角半、入後即漸漸無力、各項皆見疲弱無神、計反小去五分至二角不等、次盤趨勢、依然不振、大都續小五分一角至三角半不等、獨統稅尚好起五分至一角半、可見市上暫時對時局無甚感覺、祗隨籌碼供求、略有細微之上落耳、市價結果、計小五分一角至三角半、成交總數、約計一千五六百萬元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>對於家爲先生檢討一個更小問題瞎說幾句</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>我前天做了「關於曹先生提出大衆語的幾個小問題說幾句話」一文，在增刊内發表後，引起了家爲先生的誤會，亦來「關於大衆語討論中一個更小問題的檢討」一文，天然對於我的意見，深致不滿，不過我的頭腦冬烘呢？還是肚子裏墨水不多的緣故？所以家爲先生越檢討，弄得我越糊塗了。</p>
<p>家爲先生反駁我的一文，共分四點，但所謂四點，意龐義雜，繆誤迭出，不能作整個的辯論，只有隨便提出先生誤會之點，加以糾正，因此行文不免過長，使編輯先生，看了頭痛，更以增刊寶貴的篇幅，平白地像日本人一樣，佔去了地輿的一大幅，深爲抱歉的。</p>
<p>原文云「卽家爲先生的原文以下照此）人類社會中的一切，决不會由你自在地超越歷史，而這問題的所以産生的發展，也正由於歷史的客觀的條件所决定。</p>
<p>確眞，一切事件的發生，總具歷史的客觀條件，就是從文言文到白話文說來，也具有歷史的性質，孔二先生曰，辭達而已矣，李杜的詩，老嫗能解，也無非要其淺顯，明朱太祖曰，古人爲文，以明道德，通世務，典謨之言，皆明白易知。如今翰林爲文，但取通道理明世務者，無事浮藻，後來唐荆川先生更明白地主張白話文了，這一點歷史的事實。在五四運動時，適之獨秀諸人，提倡白話文，其實他們不過根據宋儒的語錄，宋朝的平話，及水滸紅樓夢等白話文體，擴而充之，其實並没有多大的創作，這是就敎歷史的根據。故孔子曰，殷因於夏禮，所損益可知也，周因於殷禮，所損益可知也。可知所謂歷史，是「漸進」的，不是「突進」的，今人因爲胡適輩出了風頭以去，我也來一個大衆語來玩玩，恐怕總有些吃力不討好罷。</p>
<p>原文又云，在今日的社會中，爲了生産力與生産關係的矛盾，不斷的發展、而社會日趨於集體化過程上的必然底産物。</p>
<p>照先生這樣說來，一時代有一時代的産物，君主時代的産物文言文，共和時代時産物白話文，現在時代的産物大衆語，再後時代的産物恐怕要像程咬金做大元帥一樣，有功的一大圈，有過的大一豎吧。</p>
<p>原文又云，大衆的名詞正須代表着一般負得了歷史的發展時代的演進上的使命而可前進的大衆。</p>
<p>這原來是一個代表制度，一般老百姓天然負不起這樣重大使命，而負得起這樣重大使命天然是口若懸河眼像銅鈴的幾位先生們，不過代表制度從前咨議院國會省議會，亦曾經有過這樣一套把戲，結果祇有賄選，打架，翻桌子，甩墨盒，代表制度如斯而已，現在的代表制度閙了多時也一點看不見什麽成績來，是什麽緣故。</p>
<p>原文又說大衆語和大衆文是不能分開討論的，這個在稍留意些文字學的人，是誰也都知道，關於大衆文學，並不是今日才來提出的，遠在數年前，早就有過一度的討論和産生的了。</p>
<p>我主張分别討論自有我的理由，他把我的理由撇開不講，已屬牛頭不對馬面，而云曾經有過一度討論和産生，恕我寡陋，討論則曾聞之矣，産生則並没有看見。不知産生的大衆語，到底是什麽樣？並且已經産生了，這時何必再來討論？</p>
<p>原文又說，今日所提出的大衆語，就只要寫得出聽得懂講得出。</p>
<p>倒像這種言語文字，非常便當，能寫就能聽，能聽就能講，不必仔細去討論，我恐這種文字，非人力所能造得出麽？祗有上帝可以創造。不過上帝六天創造世界以後，星期日要休息休息，恐没有功失，再來替我們造大衆語罷？</p>
<p>原文又說大衆語的建設，正將成爲最簡易普及而完備的敎育大衆的一種工具；而大衆語文的建設，和其他部門如大衆語的電影戲劇等，正是相對的提高大衆文化水準。</p>
<p>我所要研究的便是這種工具，究竟斧頭呢？還是鑿子？鋤頭呢？還是鐵鈀？這種工具，究屬是怎樣形式？現在大衆語旣没有産生，而電影院戲劇塲早已統統都有，已是奇事。並且說要在這裏頭提高文化水準，又是奇事，現在事體只有跟着大衆跑，爲什麽又要提高他們的文化呢？從前不曉得大衆語在那裏，現在幸蒙家爲先生的指導，便尋着了，原來在電影院裏戲劇塲裏，我眞是快活得很；不過戲塲影戲院的大衆語都是提高娘娘太太少爺小姐們的水準綫的，並不是提高一般勞力苦工農夫的水準綫。</p>
<p>原文又說，關於大衆語建設中的土話與方言的揚棄和發展的問題，各方面討論很多，在這裏可以不必說了。</p>
<p>爲什麽這裏可不必多說？這裏是討論這問題最嚴重的核心。因爲各方面的討論，没有切實和良善的辦法出來，眞是曹聚仁先生所謂「只有鑼鼓閙塲不見袍笏登塲」，所以要來討論討論，而先生謂各方面討論已多，可以不必說了，照這樣說來，就是先生寫了數百字的大文，也是多此一舉。</p>
<p>先生的文字，我在增刊裏頭，曾經拜讀過幾篇，非常欽佩，而這篇文字，内容非常矛盾，並且避開實際的討論，專在浮面上兜圈子，殊爲不解。我寫到這裏字數已經不少了，不能詳細地再說下去；不過先生旣對於瞥脚的文字開了玩笑，我不能不說幾句話，亦來開開玩笑，倘若先生認爲侮辱而大光其火，再來一個檢討、那是我吃不消了，只有打個招呼，請先生不要動氣。</p>
<h3>從大小脚談到婦女解放</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>昔者品評美人，全視脚之大小，金蓮三寸，就是美的標準，於是美人都風擺楊柳，體態輕盈，除了月下焚香，窗前品簫之外，什麽事都做不來。一雙小脚也深藏於羅裙之内，不肯輕易示人，嗜茄癖者，在歷史上最著名的有堆小脚以爲樂的大殘殺。</p>
<p>時至一九三四，婦女解放高唱雲霄，縫裙婆的紅菱已引不起人們的美感了。反之，脚要愈大愈好，一跑幾十里，一跳數尺高（雖跑進跳舞塲的時候也穿起高跟皮鞋來扭扭擺擺，這是又當别論，不在話下。）一雙尺板似的脚跳跳蹦蹦，才能博得拳術家的躬執鞭役。</p>
<p>這並不是大小的優勝劣敗，乃是時代的不同，小的時代，拚着性命裹起丈二長的脚帶來；大的時代，跑跳蹤躍，飛簷走壁。前者因女人禁閉在封建之塔内，她們不得不這樣做作來博取男子的歡心。後者是覺悟的女性，她們喊過婦女解放等口號，自然，鍜鍊健康的體格才是解放的初步：她們不甘在經濟的銷鍊下做男子的附屬品，她們要在社會上，政治上爭奪男子的地位。然而時代乃是個金箍圈，經過了幾次婦女解放，掙脫了舊的鎖鍊，再無形的被新的鎖鍊錮住，脚雖放大了，她們所希望獲得的是什麽都没有。</p>
<p>據化妝品及花邊的入口調查，大脚的時代女兒僅僅是打倒了三寸金蓮的苦肉計，還是像孫猴子一般的套住在這金箍圈中。</p>
<p>語云：「當局者迷，旁觀者清。」這話還有五分道理，小脚姑娘根本不曉得婦女的地位，小脚是美的標準，那就咬緊牙關小一小起來，並且還有「從此天下父母心，不重生男重生女，」的歌頌功德，掩住了自已的眼睛跑進迷宫，到香消玉殞也不知道倒底幹了一回什麽把戲。現在脚放大了，喊的口號也怪時髦，見了男子就是敵人，誰說了「花瓶」，「招牌」，相率海陸空軍來一次破釜沉舟，博得一個紙上談兵的男女平權，其實呢，也是在迷宫旋轉，不過這回是張了眼睛的，抱了我不入地獄，誰入地獄的雄心來做英雄好漢，但是想想開眼吃啞藥的味道罷。</p>
<p>寫完了知道我又是惹了滔天大禍。不過我没有摇着鵝毛扇定做「借箭」的勾當。這兩天讀讀報章讀出一肚皮鳥氣來，想請大脚的姑娘們跳出迷宫來瞧瞧四面鼓掌歡呼的人們！</p>
<h3>哀韓君天方</h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>這似乎已成了時髦的風尚，文人死而後貴。今天接到陳君的哭慰農，才知好友天方已於七月一日去世，不覺凄然者久之。細查文具櫃中，尚有存稿兩篇，因失了時間性而没有發表的，本可以加上遺著兩字替我的好友出出死風頭；然而韓君有靈，我知道他一定不願意這樣做的。就隨手抛棄，了此一重公案罷，文人活時没有飯吃，死後風光要來何用？</p>
<p>去年秋季在聚餐席上認識天方，他任職於世界書局編輯所，今年春，調任蘇州第二編輯所，我們歡聚不及半年，在報館中最後一面就成了永訣，臨别的談話彷彿就是他此去的讖語。</p>
<p>那天午後他到編輯室來見叔通先生說：他當晚要動身到蘇州去了，如果上海有機會，馬上回來的，祗要生活能敷衍過去，他是什麽都不計較的。</p>
<p>「何必戀戀於上海呢？」我問。</p>
<p>「其實換了環境，也是好的，不過我好像總離不開上海似的。」</p>
<p>「我倒很想蘇州去哩。」</p>
<p>「可惜我們不能調換工作！」</p>
<p>因爲他還有一點瑣事要在動身之前幹完，他臨走約我們今年春假到蘇州去玩，「那邊是天堂哩！」他笑着走了。</p>
<p>這一笑就結束了他的一生，天堂的生活到底不是我們等閑之輩所能享受的，他離不開上海大概就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>今年春天曾接到他兩封信，心中很想作一個短距離的旅行，讓自已的頭腦清醒一下，但是文人活時每天要吃飯，春假旅行是没福的，而且蘇州是天堂呢！這樣就失却了我們最後會面的機會，然而說起來也是很好的，詩人所謂「缺憾的美」。生離死别，雖是人生最痛苦的境遇，但是天下無不散之筵席，離别這個罪惡的世界到極樂國去，有許多人在往這條路上跑哩。</p>
<p>天方死了，當初聚餐席上的同文聽了這消息，一定哀他的天不假年，但對於死者有什麽關係叫？所以我題哀韓君天方者，哀他何必到這世上來做過路客，死了就死了，一個爲國爲家都没有裨益的人，雖說他是個有作爲的青年人啊！</p>
<h3>田塲上</h3>
<p>— 謙</p>
<p>許村的人們已經絶望啦！秧，没有種的也很多，種下去的都被太陽洒得昏昏沉地現着死氣：就是現在立刻冲下二三尺深的大雨來，恐怕也不能救醒這萎臥在鐵般硬的龜裂的田塊裏的矮黃的早稻。可是，望望天，仍舊是一塊弓形的青鐵板，厚厚地遮蓋着人們的希望。他們早曉得是絶望了，但是還拚命的跑到二三里路外的淺河中搶水，好像不做這些血汗的工作是死也不瞑目的！</p>
<p>長福媽偏偏不爭氣地要臨盆了，痛得她在牀口打滾。汗，濕透了她的布衣。長福眼看着媽這麽的痛，除了陪着哭一會之外更没有辦法，他只得硬着頭皮奔出破屋子，想到田裏呌回他的爸爸來。</p>
<p>許大肩着二桶用着九牛二虎之力搶來的泥水，赤着膊飛快的跑，背上擠出來的汗珠滑了下來，沿着他的足跡映在地上，但一刹時又被太陽吞滅了。</p>
<p>「爸！媽媽……」</p>
<p>「好，長福！你來得巧，快將那二個桶肩上，一同到西邊臭河浜去搶水」！</p>
<p>「爸爸！不，媽媽在……」</p>
<p>「不要嚕囌！你在家躱着也玩得够了，快跟我去，車邊塘河廟已經乾透了，快到臭河浜去還有些水，晚了就被人家搶去了！」</p>
<p>許大說着先挑起了担子走，長福又不敢再說，只得落着涙跟着跑。</p>
<p>天已晚了，但是太陽仍舊猛烈地同他們追着燒，灼得長福的皮都焦起來，眼睛混沌得糊塗，身體將要昏倒，但是却不敢坐下歇息一分鐘。挑了這半天的肩頭，差不多已起了水泡，脚骨軟得發抖，但是仍舊跟着許大拚命地跑。</p>
<p>「小鬼，還不乘詹天還未全黑快些</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>挑！你不看見田裏乾得這般模樣、假使今年再一荒，再想有飯吃嗎？」許大駡了長福一頓，催着他快走。</p>
<p>晚來的微風拂拭着長福的臉，他的腦子似乎清醒了一些：猛的記起媽媽在家痛得在床上打滾的情影，又知道媽這二天没有吃東西……。耳中好像響着他母親呻吟的呌喚：「長福！……長福！長……」。</p>
<p>「爸！」他拚着一股勇氣說了，「挑了這一担就好了罷？」</p>
<p>「許大不答應，彷彿没有聽到一般，挑着担仍舊往河浜跑。於是長福打起精神再問：</p>
<p>「爸爸，我可以回去麽？」</p>
<p>許大立刻回轉臉來：「什麽！」</p>
<p>「媽媽在家中痛得打滾，在呌我呢！」</p>
<p>「誰聽見了，你仔細！假使田枯死了，連你媽一個都不留，都要死的」！長福雖然不敢違命逃走，但是他的心已經奔過了稻田，蹪進屋了，在媽媽面前哭，安慰，他的腦中憧憬着媽媽痛得在打滾，耳中只聽得媽媽的喊聲：「長福！……長福，長……」</p>

<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>隂暗的家呵！你五年飄泊在海外的遊子歸來了！</p>
<p>家？你有腐爛的靈魂，有霉臭的廳堂，有憂鬱的人心，有煩厭的閙聲，………家呵！家呵！</p>
<p>母親笑得涙都流出來了，她吃吃地：「今天來？今天來？」别的是說不出來了。這可愛的慈顔喲，不爲您，我怎麽要回桼呢？</p>
<p>祖母鶴髮童顔，康健如昔。注視着這走攏來的孫兒，說：「是誠兒吧？誠兒吧？呵，更長大了？長大了？看見你，我怎麽歡喜，怎麽歡喜呢？」</p>
<p>父親坐在廳角里的一把靠背椅上微笑。這慈和的老人喲！</p>
<p>小孩子們從我的旅行籃里搜出二隻鱷魚來。他們開始受嚇而逃跑，繼而注視，最後却拿起來玩了。</p>
<p>於是，從可愛的温暖的赤道之國的懷抱中脫逃歸來，又隨落在這古老的故家了。</p>
<p>然而隂暗的家呵！這里的破敗的靈魂，有霉臭的廳堂，有憂鬱的人心，有煩厭的閙聲，……</p>
<p>又不能够忍耐這腐爛氣氛的包圍，而想免掉這古老的破敗的舊家所加於流浪的遊子的壓迫，於是又從那高大而莊嚴的屋門里溜出來了。</p>
<p>呵，古老的封建的舊家呵！</p>
<p>可是在𫙊載着我的火輪這怪物的肚腹中前進的時光，又想起這隂暗的舊家來了。離别的刹那是：母親的涙流出來，祖母呆呆若失，父親沈下臉苦笑着，而可愛的弟妹們牽住我的衣裾，哭着不放住手。</p>
<p>想着隂鬱的古老的故家，令人頭痛；然而想起遠離那里邊的愛我的人，又怎不怦怦然心慟呢？</p>
<p>呵，别離了五年而像旅館做十日宿的隂暗的舊家呵，再會呢！祖母雙親和可愛的弟妹們呵，請饒恕你們的隨着時代而流蕩的遊子和哥哥吧！</p>
<p>呵，什麽時候才有個新的家來供養你們呢？</p>
<h3>蘇聯青年的飛行遊戲（下）</h3>
<p>— （莫斯科通訊）（引沅）</p>
<p>（三）一幅美麗的畫圖</p>
<p>去年八月間的航空節，在該校所在地曾有這樣一幅好景緻。就是六十二個帶傘跳落者同時從一中隊的飛機上勇敢地跳入空中，六十二朶各種色彩的山慈姑，頃刻間在青天白日裏怒放起來。這六十二個帶傘跳落者，都是屬於該校的人物，由於他們勇毅的以身作則，吸引了不少新加入的份子。現在莫斯科一處地方，已有幾十個帶傘跳落者研究組，他們大半在工廠裏。在各省，在烏克蘭，在洛斯托夫，列寗格勒特等大城市裏也有學校及小組的設立。</p>
<p>帶傘跳落對於人體結構的效果如何，至今還没有詳細加以研究過，但是該校在今年擬開始考究這問題。這裏特别值得指出一點，卽是年歲已過四十的人也能很有成績地學習這種遊戲。</p>
<p>這種遊戲絶對不止限於男人的，因爲許多婦女已有多次的奏效的跌落，並且已成爲敎練員。有些男子有多次不敢而拒絶跳落，但在女子中間從没有過這回事發現，這確實是一件大堪注意的事情。假使女人已下决心跳落，她就會堅决地執行她的决議案。</p>
<p>除了尋常式的帶傘跳落外，上述的學校還敎人緩慢的降落。這種降落，要從幾千米達的高度開始的，並且需要具有多量筋力和勇氣才能成就。這裏帶傘跳落者，將從長距離的高處跳下，並且等候離地面祇有幾百米達時，才放開下落傘。從已經實騐過的這種跳落所得的效果，就可證明人體機構能够維持强度奮力的。</p>
<p>總之，帶傘降落，是具有實際的和科學的價值，蘇聯正在普通地發展這種遊戲。</p>
<h3>江上</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>在江上，海洋風括得挺猛的。險些兒，紳士的白色軟木帽給吹去啦。</p>
<p>飛坐在船梢上，浪花像雨點般的濺上來。四面漆黑地，祗聽得江水奔騰的聲音。燈塔的光茫，在每一秒鐘裏，亮着：暗着。回頭看上海，被一片紅雲籠罩住：迷濛地。</p>
<p>船上交織着白熱的燈光，無綫電播着迷人的音調，幾個碧眼兒在哼着「啦啦！啦啦啦」一直到吳淞。</p>
<p>在白帆布的椅子上，每一個的嘴角邊都掛着笑。四七一一的香味，剌着人的鼻管，被一陣海風吹去：又飄散着一陣。娘兒們的散髮，給一陣陣的海風吹得怪蓬亂的。西洋的太太們，把玲瓏的帽沿；厭着電燙過了的髮髻。</p>
<p>輕狂的笑語，籠罩住竟個的艙面。在江上，每一對青年的伴侣在浪費着自已的青春。</p>
<p>一個秃了頂的紳士，在一把籐椅上躺熟啦：鼾聲吹散在海洋風的旋律裏。兩個異性的伴侣，逗着他的睡態笑，自已却安閒地吸着捲烟：望着掛滿星星的蒼穹。</p>
<p>呷着啤酒，江風凉爽地拂過面頰。多够味呀，看着每一個人動的姿態。那六月的女人，具有着多方面之誘惑性的；勾引着都市色情文化下動摇着的青年。鮮紅的荔枝，銀色的杏子，把每一顆核投到江心裏，輕微的聲浪；隨着船尾的白沫飄去咧。</p>
<p>慶寗寺，東溝漸漸地落在後面了；望見了高橋江邊的街燈。風把每一個人都捲得窒息着，吹動着娘兒們肩上的坎肩；像自由神的翅膀在招展着。</p>
<p>一雙雙的伴侣，都溜到碼頭上。朦朧地公共汽車的影子在移動了。朝着海濱飯店去的路。</p>
<p>黃色渡輪的引擎又發動啦，艙面上人少了許多。疲倦地倒在椅子上，巡視着夜的黃浦江，帶着一顆凉快的心，又擠散在都市的人羣裏。</p>

<h3>呆子（三）</h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>「呆子，給我担水呀！給你噴香的飯吃呢。」</p>
<p>「給我也担幾担呀，呆子。我有虎血一樣的老酒！」</p>
<p>「蜜甜的白米糖要吃嗎？要吃就給我担水呀！」</p>
<p>各種蜜甜的清脆的聲音從四方八面飄到呆子的耳跟，像針尖一樣地剌着他的神經，使他全身起了異樣的興奮。他東一眼西一眼地瞅個不住，「眞好看，眞好看！」地啍個不住，最後就給她們一個公共的回答：</p>
<p>「担，担呀！」</p>
<p>於是在嘖嘖的贊揚聲中，在熱烈的鼓勵聲中，一担兩担，三担…………　　「歇歇吧，呆子丨吃點東西再担！」</p>
<p>呆子笑嬉嬉地從命了。</p>
<p>接着又是一担，兩担，三担…………</p>
<p>担水，在一個壯年農夫固不算最吃力的工作，但一雙全村出名的大柏樹水桶（她們呌呆子担水時十之七八總借用進雙水桶），一不小心就得滑倒的雨天濕滑的道路，來回足足有一里路的長距離，這對於在非人的生活的折磨之下血肉漸漸離開了粗大的骨骼的呆子，却也不是不費力的事。當他接連地挑了十念担滿盈盈的井水的時候，他就像大熱天工作過度的老牛一樣急喘着氣，兩腿戰巍巍地站不住了。他按例先在沿堦上坐了一息，而接着就往後一仰，默默地仰臥在冰隂的泥地上了。</p>
<p>「哦，吃力了嗎，呆子？多歇一息哪！歇一歇給我也挑幾担。我給你做媒呀！」</p>
<p>呆子無力地摇摇頭，表示再也挑不動了。</p>
<p>「多歇一息。挑不動就挑半担，我給你做媒呀！」</p>
<p>於是不過半個鐘頭，掛着沉重的柏樹桶的扁担重又壓在他的肩上了。</p>

<h3>復古運動聲中的禁映男女共演影片（上）</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>時代進展到一九三四年，在中國眞是一個奇怪的年頭。這不僅僅是熱度會高到六十年來所未有，而更主要的是瘋狂的復古運動，使我們覺得最驚奇而又最可怕。</p>
<p>所謂復古運動，自然是要將中國回復到很古的時代去、換句話說，卽是大家所說的開倒車。而開倒車到底是一椿很艱難的工作，因爲常有將車廂裏的乘客推落在深坑或者是大河裏的危險。果如此，可憐的乘客們天然是死於非命，不過這在車頭裏的指揮者是可以不管的。然而雖然這樣，可是復古運動，的確是在士大夫們提倡之下，正人君子們在滿頭大汗呐喊得十分起勁的。關於他們的功績，我們從復興文言文以至於禁止男女同行…我們可以舉出許多，幾乎是漪歟盛哉的了。而現在據報紙的記載，在與每外開通，最早而是革命策源地的廣東地方，已經進展（？）到禁止男女共演影片了。</p>
<p>在此，關於那堂堂正正的禁條，似乎有恭錄轉載的必要。「（一）禁止男女同車，（二）禁止男女同食，（無論官署家庭，茶樓酒館，一律禁止男女同食。女人須俟男人食終，方可進食。）（三）禁止男女同住，（旅館一律禁止男女同住一室。）（四）禁止軍人人民同行，（五）電影館禁止開映男女同演影片。至於陳伯南將軍提倡尊經復古，海軍司令張之英提禁男女同泳以及男女散髮之區别等案，皆經該會全部通過實施。」在該禁條的前面，尚有如下幾句，不能不照實抄錄：「新生活運動以來，所謂禁止男女同行之布告外，尚有所謂禁止男女同住同食之命令，而廣東政治研究會，更通過男女界限如下。」而且該記者在後更爲大胆，並加按語說：「然一般時代的青年男女，皆認爲無聊已極，大加反對云。」</p>
<p>以上的條文，自一到四，可以說不在本文的範圍以内，唯有第五條對於電影院的指命，那我們眞祗好呼寃呌屈了。不消說，電影這東西，在這種情形之下，祗有全部死滅。理由很簡單，因爲電影是反映社會眞實的藝術，而社會上有男也有女，從前是如此，現在也是如此，將來還是如此，那末電影中自然也得有男人也有女人了。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「天崩地裂」</h3>
<p>— 丹楓</p>
<p>Looking　for　Trouble丨南京</p>
<p>不久以前，國泰映過一部華納出品的「都市之聲」，那是以電話爲題材，寫一個勇敢機警的電話工人，因爲努力奉公，更爲某老閭盡力奪回失欵，結果他得了一些賞金，和一電話女接綫生好合以終。現在這一部二十世紀公司出品的「天崩地裂」，也同樣是以電話爲題材，也是寫一電話工人，在努力工作，大功告成之後，和一接綫生結婚大吉。</p>
<p>電影的内容，相同到如此地步，决不是偊然的事實。相反的，這正說明製片家們是怎樣的在奪取觀衆。然而他們並不在内容方面來較量，而僅僅是同樣的題材之獵取，於是某家開始攝製了以打球爲題材的影片，不久便羣起爭相效尤、打球的片子便風行一時。此外野獸片或者是偵探片，都曾經一時充塞市塲，而今後也許還有幾部取材於電話的影片出現吧？這是很有可能的。</p>
<p>但是我們却以爲假使將FayEnright的「都市之聲一和這一部WilliamWellman的「天崩地裂」比較一下的話，那我們將認爲後者是不及前者的了。在這一影片中，我們固然不能說毫無成績，至少有幾句俏皮的話是很可使人發笑的。但是比重的說，祗憑幾句俏皮話是不能遮蓋劇中過多的沉悶塲面的，而且其中三次，較爲緊張的部份，（一）旦叔德掘地道盜欵以至喬與凱塞的被擒，（二）喬撳火警鈴，救火車隊出發，（三）突然地震：都不能極好的攫住觀衆的情緒。特别是後二者，導演將其當作高潮而使用，因爲從高潮到低落的過和太快，使人們覺得那Climax並没有完全發揮應有的力量，結果使我們覺得那二次高潮是多餘的東西。關於這一點，自然是剪接的關係，導演的Montage的確是不十分高明的。如以都市之聲」相比較，那自始至終一貫的諧趣之保持，很够顯出這一影片之軟弱了。</p>
<p>有一種影片是形式主義的勝利，使人們不能直覺的感覺故事之庸俗討厭，而有一種却不能掩飾内容的空虚或平凡。「天崩地裂」應當是屬於後一種類。</p>
<p>我們相信，好的演員决不能在平庸的導演手法中展開他們的技能。史本山屈賽在法蘭克鮑才琪的「男性的慰藉」中演得很好，在這裏却祇是稱職而已。賈克奥齊還好，康斯丹克明又是平平。</p>
<p>關於威廉華爾曼，我們看過他的作品很多，多半是很成熟的，不過這一影片，我們却不敢稱讚。</p>
<h3>結婚四次尚見離異的女明星史横生</h3>
<p>— 鶴琴</p>
<p>離婚在好萊塢原不算一件什麽奇事，不過一個男明星或女明星連離婚三四次的，確也是一件罕事。不久以前，我們聽到約翰吉爾勃是曾經離過四次婚的。但是最近好萊塢發現以風騷著名的女明星格羅利亞史横生，也是離過三次婚的人。最近據說因她丈夫不願她再上銀幕的緣故，又要預備提出離異了。像這樣以結婚爲兒戲的，吉爾勃和她眞是一對。</p>
<p>她第一個丈夫就是現在在銀幕上很負盛名的華雷斯皮萊。第二個丈夫是已死的嚇白脫薩勃；是好萊塢「貢帽子」飯店的老閭；第三調是法國享利侯爵丨現在是康斯登絲本揑脫的丈夫。最後她始嫁給現在尚未離去的第四個丈夫，名呌麥柯爾發墨ＭichaelFariner。他是她四個丈夫中最年青最漂亮的一個，比她自已的年紀還要輕去很多。</p>
<p>他們初次相見是在歐洲。二人一見傾心，就此訂了白首之約而她也息聲影界。二年來跟着她的年輕丈夫往來歐美，到也非常相得。那知她近來又想重作馮婦，再上銀幕，而她的丈夫却是非常反對，因此二個人不免閙起意見來。幾個禮拜以前麥柯爾一個人負氣離開好萊塢，而史横生仍住在那裏，因此他們二個人將要離婚的事情，好萊塢更是閙得響亮。據史横生她自已說，她們倆的離異恐也是難免的了！</p>
<h3>曼麗特蘭漱死後的哀榮</h3>
<p>— 羅玉</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱六十歲榮任好萊塢皇后的那衆，世界影壇上眞是傳爲一時的佳話，歷來的皇后，都是具有美麗的容貌，青春的年齡，曼麗特蘭漱做皇后的那年，已白髮婆娑，她曾經和醜夫華雷史皮萊二人比賽誰生得醜陋，但是她占據了好萊塢明星目耽視下的皇后寶座竟是好萊塢有史以來的破天荒第一遭，當時贊頌之輿論，亦爲好萊塢罕見的。</p>
<p>現在，這位老明星與世長逝了，她的死耗從好萊塢傳出以後，影界中都非常哀悼，好萊塢許多明星紛紛致電往弔，歐洲各國的影界，也紛紛發了電報到美國哀悼，美國自從建國到現在，祗有林肯死的那一次，有過這樣熱閙。此外竟没有一人能够比得上了。</p>
<p>曼麗生在一八七一年十一月九日，當她六十歲誕辰的時候，前任美國總統胡佛的夫人曾在華盛頓替她張誕慶祝。影界有史以來有如是榮耀的，以曼麗爲第一。曼麗病危於聖得巴勒醫院的時候，羅斯福總統的夫人亦親往慰問。海外電訊相傳，亦如雪片一般。可見曼麗爲人尊重的一斑。她逝世之後，好萊塢第一流明星親自去弔唁的很多，據稱以前范倫鐵諾死後，執紼幾千人。現在曼麗特蘭漱的葬儀，當不亞於當年也。</p>
<p>曼麗死後，可認爲遺憾的一件事，就是她身後没有一個親屬。她的家中祇有一個遠族中的姊妹，此外都没有了。</p>
<p>曼麗的一生，雖做了許多工作，得到了不少錢，但是到臨死之前亦没有多少財産。她平時生活是很節儉的，所有的金錢，亦不浪費。但是因爲她素來喜歡善舉，不斷的接濟許多貧人，因此她的財産都化光了。美國的貧人受過了她的接濟的，這一次她死了，亦不免替他痛哭一塲了。</p>
<p>曼麗在未死二星期前，已立了遺囑。她吩咐將她一生工作換來的金錢，都帮助貧苦的殘廢和老弱者。身後祗要立刻安葬，其他都没有什麽牽掛。此外她又說，她到影界裏做了許多戲，現在是眞的一幕戲劇的閉幕時了。</p>
<h3>私願難償</h3>
<p>— 侖</p>
<p>許久以前，有一位美麗姑娘，一心想做尼姑。她常常幻夢着她作了尼姑，而退隱到象徵和平和安靜的庵裏時。她是誰？就是漢倫海絲（ＨelenHayes）</p>
<p>但是，這可愛的少女，並未有實現她早年的私願，最少在舞台生活的時候，表演這角色的機會也没有試過，但是在「白姊妹」影片裏，她扮演的却是一個尼姑的角色，而且表演得很出色。直至現在，這還是她生平最得意的傑作哩。</p>

<h3>佳兒佳婦（Born　to　be　Kissed）（十二）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>傑弗生菜市街的監獄門開了，湯姆踱了進來。憶迪抬起她憔悴的臉，她的眼請已經哭得紅腫了，她看見了湯姆，不覺歡呼起來。她抱住了他喊道：「我知道你會來的，快抱住我吧！」湯姆將她擁抱了一回，然後將她放鬆了，看着她的臉問她道：「到底那個人是誰，你和他在一起給他們找着的？」憶迪呌屈道：「我亦不認識！那都是他們做的圈套！你不能不信我！你要是不信，我不用活着了！」湯姆遲疑一下，然後說道：「我信是信的，但是你相誰做的圈套，來陷害你的呢？」憶迪聽了，就不覺眼中暖火，嘴唇都震動了。她恨恨地喊道：「我知道的！那不是别人，就是你的尊翁！我知道得明明白白，好像我親耳聽見他設計調排的一樣！他們告我偷竊克新斯的綠寶石……這祗有你父親一個人知道，那是克新斯當面送給我的！」這個時候潘其正站在鐵籠子外面。他聽見了憶迪的話，就裝作十二分和靄的神氣，對着湯姆道：「兒子，我聽見憶迪所說的話了。但是她的神經快錯亂了。她已經受了不少痛苦了。」憶迪兩眼瞪着潘共喊道：「你知道的！這都是你給我的好處！」湯姆解勸着道：「憶迪，快不要這樣，父親是特來保你出去的呀！」憶迪道：「保我出去？我知道！他是來保我從你的生命裏出去的！」她哭了。潘其在旁邊，還假仁假義地說道：「你本來就不應該將那兩顆寶石顯給人家看呀。」憶迪道：那是克新斯送給我的……你明明知道的！」潘其說道：「憶迪，你要這樣說，我亦没有法子。但是我替你藏着，倒有些後悔了。被這種案子牽涉一下，到底不是好聽的東西。」憶迪聽了，對着他駡道：「你這假冐爲善的老東西！」湯姆在旁邊疑問道：「你爲什麽要拿那東西，給我的父親代藏呢？」憶迪聽了，知道潘其已經在他的兒子的心裏，埋伏了懷疑不信之意了，就發狂似的喊道：「爲什麽？就是因爲我恐怕那些警察們不信我的話，所以才求他帮助的」湯姆道：「不是父親還給你錢，呌你到别的地方去的嗎？」憶迪道：「這是他告訴你的嗎？那錢是他借給我的……但是並没有說到别的地方去。我没有犯什麽罪，我爲什麽要逃走呢？」湯姆道：」「但是你確實出門去的呀……」潘其又說道：「你到底是克新斯的什麽人，你告訴湯姆吧。」憶迪道：「我不是他的什麽人。他亦不是我的什麽人。那天晚上，我是第一次和他相見。這都是實話，湯姆。」她拿含着兩包眼涙的眼睛，對着湯姆懇求似的看着。湯姆道：「你不是說過，他願意娶你爲妻……而你們已經訂了婚了嗎？」憶迪道：「我……他倒是實在呌我和他結婚的，但是也許他故意愚弄我……」潘其在旁邊揷嘴道：「怎麽說？他不是已經將要自殺的嗎？」憶迪給他這麽一點，愈覺得潘其的狡詭，於是不覺又高聲駡道：「你這滿嘴胡說，設計害人的老東西！」他萬分失望了，知道鬥不過那位深謀老算的老外交家了。潘其於是就轉向他的兒子道：「兒子，她差不多已經回答了一切的問題了。二湯姆莫名其妙的、向他父親看着，又向憶迪看着。（未完）</p>

<h3>Huang Fu Passes Through Nanjing to Go to Guling</h3>
<p>Tang Youren and Others Host a Banquet in Tangshan</p>
<p>Then Boards the Zhongshan Warship and Sets Sail Westward</p>
<p>Yin Tong Concludes Talks and Travels with Huang</p>
<p>Huang Issues a Written Statement in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Council, descended from Mogan Mountain on the morning of the 9th, took his own car with the license plate "Zhe Zi No. 9" and arrived in Nanjing via the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway. His accompanying secretary, Wang Dagang, and one attendant, along with ten pieces of luggage, followed in two cars of the Hangzhou Daya Automobile Company, license numbers 1026 and 1150. He arrived at Tangshan at 1:10 PM and alighted at Tao Lu. Tang Youren, Vice Minister; Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau; Xu Jingcang, Director of the Documents Bureau of the National Government Secretariat; and five Nanjing-Shanghai reporters were already waiting. Huang was wearing a light yellow suit, carrying a walking stick, and looked radiant. After getting out of the car, he entered the main hall of Tao Lu with Tang, Yin, Xu, and others for lunch. They exchanged pleasantries during the meal. After the meal, Huang and Tang held secret talks in another room for an hour regarding the handling of diplomatic affairs in North China. Afterward, he came out to meet the reporters, saying that he was slightly dizzy due to the fatigue of the journey and had prepared a written statement for release, asking for their understanding. At the request of a reporter, a photo was taken in front of the steps. He then entered the city with Vice Minister Tang in car number 887. Yin Tong, Wang Dagang, and accompanying staff and luggage followed in a total of eight cars. They entered Zhongshan Gate at 3:35 PM and arrived at the naval dock at 3:55 PM. Those who came to see him off at the dock included Chen Xunyong, Vice Minister of the Navy, and several of Huang's friends from Nanjing. Huang boarded the ship amidst the melodious sounds of the band and set sail westward at 4:02 PM. His traveling companions were Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Secretary Wang Dagang, attendants, and a total of four people. The ship is expected to arrive in Xun on the afternoon of the 10th and then proceed to Lushan. (Special dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu passed through Nanjing on the 9th on his way to Guling. At 6:30 AM, he left Mogan Mountain with his entourage, Wang Dagang and attendants, in three cars. They departed at 7:00 AM and arrived at Tangshan at 1:10 PM without delay along the way. Yin Tong, Tang Youren, Xu Jingzhi, and others arrived in Tangshan one after another to welcome him. Tang and others hosted a banquet at Tao Lu to welcome Huang. Later, Huang, Tang, and Yin held talks for an hour. At 3:00 PM, they left the mountain in the original cars. At 4:00 PM, they arrived at the Xiaguan naval dock and boarded the Zhongshan warship, setting sail westward at 4:05 PM. Yin Tong accompanied him. They are expected to arrive in Xun at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th and then proceed to Guling to meet Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang and President Wang. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Fu issued a written statement on the 9th, saying, "I came south to report on my duties in April, and three months have passed quickly. Looking back on the past year, it has been truly difficult to support the current critical situation in the North together with Minister He Yingqin and the authorities of various provinces and cities. Fortunately, colleagues involved in the matter have been able to understand the country's position and recognize the local environment, so they have been very harmonious and united in handling matters, allowing me to bring the initial mission when I went down the mountain last year to a barely satisfactory conclusion. However, under this kind of situation, the greatest effect of responding to foreign affairs is only so-so, not only far from satisfying the hopes of the people of the whole country, but also I and my colleagues feel deeply ashamed, sad, and apprehensive. However, the national environment is such that I have exhausted my wisdom and ability, and my mind and energy are exhausted, so I deeply wish to rest my shoulders in time to avoid bearing a heavy personal burden. However, the government authorities and friends in the government and the public are still unwilling to understand and blame me with great righteousness. Having no choice, I agreed to go to Guling for further consultation, intending to explain in detail my difficult situation in order to seek understanding. The current foreign affairs issue can be said to have shifted its focus to the reorganization of the war zone. If all kinds of disputes in the war zone can be eliminated one by one, it is also a necessary stage to go far from near and climb high from low. Currently, I have instructed Director Yin to go to Dalian to convene cadres of the Kwantung Army and the military attaché stationed in Beiping, Chaisan, for thorough discussions. When Yin Tong returned from Dalian, he made a more detailed public statement. At present, I intend to supervise the local authorities to implement these items step by step. Since Director Yin returned from Dalian, he has traveled a long distance in the hot summer, and his body feels slightly unwell, so he is resting in the mountains. He has not continued to take the second step of negotiation, so there is no other new information available for reference. As for the situation in the North in the future, it is certainly impossible to exhaust it in a few words. It is expected that if there are no special accidents at home and abroad, it will definitely become more stable day by day. However, in recent times, observing the people of the whole country, they inevitably harbor a kind of pessimistic imagination about the North, which has formed a psychological abandonment.

<h3>Bandits Suddenly Advance Westward</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandits outside the Great Wall often harass Yuguan. Because the Public Security Bureau has set up electric fences and sentries in the suburbs, looting is not as successful as they would like.

<p>Top Meeting of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3>Responding to the International Crisis</h3>
<p>Listening to Reports from Envoys Returning Home</p>
<p>Researching the Establishment of Fundamental Policies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because next year will be the two-year anniversary of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, and the Naval Disarmament Conference is determined to establish a fundamental policy in order to implement Japan's goals, Foreign Minister Hirota has ordered ambassadors and envoys stationed in various countries to return home one after another to listen to their reports for reference. Because the newly appointed Director of the Research Department, Kurihara, returned home on the 8th, it was decided to invite Saito, Ambassador to the United States; Sato, Ambassador to France; Matsushima, Ambassador to Italy; Tani Masayuki, Counselor to Manchuria; and Kurihara, Director of the Research Department, to hold a meeting of envoys stationed abroad at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 8:00 PM on the 9th.

<h3>Prime Minister Okada's Talk</h3>
<p>Proportionalism Is Not Feasible</p>
<p>A Japanese-Russian War Is Impossible</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada, along with Naval Minister Osumi, Foreign Minister Hirota, and Army Minister Hayashi, went to Nasu to greet the Emperor and departed from Ueno Station at 7:25 AM on the 9th. Prime Minister Okada spoke to reporters about the current situation in the car. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The national defense situation this year is quite problematic. Army Minister Hayashi will implement a tax increase to enrich the financial resources for national defense. This is just a rumor in the newspapers. The Ministry of Finance may also be studying this matter, but it is not known when the tax increase will take place. Recently, the newspapers have written extensively about the issue of reorganizing the organs stationed in Manchuria, but in reality, there seems to be some inaccuracy. Although I have not directly heard the content of the case from the Army Minister, in short, it is not convenient to discuss any opinions now.</p>
<p>As for the plenipotentiary representative to the disarmament conference, the world has rumored that former Prime Minister Saito or Kisaburo Suzuki is suitable, but the future is still far away, and it is not convenient to consider it now. A sense of security for national defense and proportionalism cannot coexist in principle. Those who hold sticks cannot compete with those who hold guns. The same is true in form, so the proportional plan should not be feasible. Regarding the issue of the disarmament conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy are working hard, and there is no need to be too anxious. Please entrust it to the authorities.</p>
<p>One method of Japanese-American friendship is the establishment of an information bureau stationed in the United States, as advocated by Duke Konoe, which is indeed the best method. On the Soviet-Manchurian border, there are small contact-style fighting problems between the Japanese and Soviet armies from time to time. Such situations are not surprising in areas bordering each other. If this is considered a sign that Japanese-Soviet relations are imminent, it is inappropriate. There is a so-called ruble conversion problem between Japan and the Soviet Union, and there is also the issue of the Middle East Railway, but it will not cause a major war problem. A war that stakes the national fortune on a single throw is no small matter, and there is no war in the world that is so simple. The other day, when Endo, Director of the General Affairs Agency of Manchuria, met with me, he talked about the "Kangde Emperor" planning to cross the sea to the east next spring. If this matter is realized, it will be a very happy thing for the friendship between Japan and Manchuria. (Nippon News Agency dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Budget</p>
<h3>Reaching 700 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Navy Ministry's policy for formulating the next fiscal year's budget aims to cope with the international crisis of 1935. It earnestly hopes to realize various plans. Murakami, the director of the Bureau of Accounting, has been organizing the draft budget decided upon by the budget meeting. It has been approved by Naval Minister Osumi and immediately submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The Navy Ministry's budget for the next fiscal year will be significantly increased compared to this year, with a total amount of over 700 million yuan. The notable features are as follows: (1) maintenance expenses for various warships completed in the first replenishment plan; (2) expenses for establishing and maintaining air squadrons; (3) warship remodeling expenses; (4) construction subsidies for warships. (9th Jiji News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Budget Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) As of the 10th, the Army's draft budget estimate for the next fiscal year submitted to the Ministry of Finance includes standard budget items and customary new requests. Adding in capital consolidation costs approximately 320 million yuan, and further including new requests such as Manchurian Incident expenses, air defense enhancement costs, and military equipment improvement costs, the Army's total budget actually reaches 550 million yuan. (9th Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi met with the Emperor at the Nasu Imperial Villa on the morning of the 9th to report on the Army's situation, and then returned to Tokyo by train. The Army Minister said in the train that the Army Ministry's budget for the next fiscal year has been decided. The main items include weapon improvement costs, air force enhancement costs, and other military material consolidation costs. Since the Manchurian Incident expenses have not decreased, the budget for the next fiscal year must increase compared to this year's 450 million yuan. The air force enhancement costs require 300 million yuan, but due to the state of finances, the minimum amount of funding is requested. The issue of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and Russia hinges on whether Russia can resolve various pending issues with a sincere attitude. (9th Jiji News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese and German Aggressive Ambitions</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>Moscow Newspaper Urges National Attention</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun carried a Moscow dispatch stating that Soviet Russian citizens have recently been in an unusually tense situation, ringing the alarm bell for the resurgence of a world war. The national consensus is that the spark for a world war is planned by Japan and Germany. These two countries, one from the East and one from the West, are arranging their forces to threaten Russia. On the 1st of this month, national newspapers published special "World War" editions in full page format, further stimulating the public. The newspapers generally included the following in addition to describing the history of world wars: "Japan will first fight Russia and then plan a Far East war, occupying Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Chinese mainland." The newspapers specifically cited General Tanaka's memorial and General Araki's "Mission of Showa Japan" in great detail. On the other hand, it is stated that Germany has the ambition to incorporate regions inhabited by Germans into German territory, similar to Japan's coveting of the Far East. Therefore, in addition to annexing the Baltic Sea coastal countries and Poland, Germany also wants to seize our country (referring to Russia) from Ukraine and the Don region to the Caucasus.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Puppet Anti-Russian Movement</h3>
<p>The anti-Soviet movement in newspapers in the Boli area has recently become more intense, fabricating various rough incidents and adding provocative annotations. Several days ago, Harbin newspapers announced a sinister plan of the Third International in the area, and at the same time claimed that on July 16th, four Red Army soldiers armed with guns passed through the eastern border of the Manchuria Station, penetrating 300 meters into Manchurian territory, and after several hours of reconnaissance, returned to Soviet territory. But in reality, no Red Army soldiers crossed the border. Manchurian newspapers particularly clamored that Soviet aircraft had flown over the Pogranichnaya station area, ignoring the fact that the Soviet consul had investigated the matter and confirmed it was fabricated. In recent months, the Manchurian side has indeed carried out repeated acts of aggression on the border, especially with Japanese military aircraft. The most recent was on July 29th, when a Japanese aircraft flew over the Otpork station (within Soviet territory) and continued to fly 30 kilometers into Soviet territory along the railway line. The Soviet consulate has repeatedly protested these unauthorized actions, but to no avail, as the Manchurian side either evaded answering or simply denied them, even though they did indeed carry out these actions. What is noteworthy is that the recent intensification of the anti-Soviet movement in Manchuria completely coincides in time with the anti-Soviet movement in Japanese newspapers, making one believe that they have a common goal: to provoke a threat to the Soviet Union, so that Japan can seize a lower price and other more favorable conditions at the Tokyo conference discussing the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. But the mastermind behind this threatening policy is actually placing an excessive burden on themselves, because their purpose in promoting it is only for several million yen. However, their fanatical agents and extremists in Manchuria, who have long made it their mission to undermine efforts to establish peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, will certainly take advantage of this opportunity to carry out their provocative actions.

<p>(Berlin) The Politische Correspondenz newspaper commented on the resumption of diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and Bulgaria, saying that this move could ease tensions in Eastern Europe. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>The Lithuanian Foreign Minister recently gave a speech to the press, saying that he was warmly received by the authorities during his recent trip to Russia, and was deeply moved. His meetings with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov and other government officials were also very cordial and straightforward. The two sides completely agreed on all diplomatic issues discussed, especially the Eastern European Pact. If this pact is concluded, irresponsible elements will no longer have an excuse to expand eastward. Lithuania is very willing to participate in future consultations to draft the terms of this pact. The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that Soviet Russian-Lithuanian relations are becoming increasingly close, and Lithuania loyally supports the League of Nations, so Lithuania is willing to cooperate with any country that shares the same goals.

<h3>Naval Negotiation Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Colonel Iwashita, the naval expert dispatched by Japan to England for the naval preparatory talks, arrived here this afternoon. Iwashita's authority is not very extensive, and the talks to be conducted later will be purely consultative in nature. However, the British authorities, due to Japan's repeated development declarations over the past months and the inconsistencies therein, feel that they do not understand Japan's attitude and are eager to hear Iwashita's talks in order to understand Japan's intentions. Iwashita has two other tasks here: one is to hand over instructions from the Japanese government to the Japanese ambassador, and the other is to report on the recent technical reforms of the Japanese Navy to the Japanese naval attaché in the UK. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reports that the naval talks recently conducted in London involved technical issues, and were not limited to procedural details. This level is now informally acknowledged by the general public. The most important technical issue discussed was the size of capital ship tonnage. The British government advocated limiting capital ships to 25,000 tons or 22,000 tons, and cruisers to 7,000 tons, but the American representatives firmly insisted on maintaining the current tonnage and did not support the British proposal. The disagreement between the two countries immediately became apparent. Although the British plan has been approved by Japan and France, there seems to be little hope of reaching a compromise based on this principle. Regarding the submarine issue, when French Naval Chief Pitorili came to England recently, he detailed France's views. Mr. Pitorili made it clear that France could not reduce its submarine strength. As for warships exceeding 1,850 tons, with gun calibers of 5 inches or 129 millimeters, which should be called cruisers, this is also difficult for France to accept. However, British experts believe that the French Navy has 31 leading ships with a maximum displacement of 3,000 tons and gun calibers of 5 and a half inches or 154 millimeters. According to the revision of the treaty, they should actually be treated as cruisers. Captain Picia, an Italian naval expert, also explained the reasons why his country decided to build 35,000-ton warships on the eve of the naval conference, and stated how his country's submarine and other light warship construction plans will be formulated, depending on the attitude of France. The Daily Telegraph also reported that these talks have caused a pessimistic impression among well-informed sources, because the opinions of various countries on fundamental issues of naval policy are very different, and this was revealed in these talks.

<h3>Italian Naval Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Fully Demonstrating Combat Effectiveness</p>
<p>Mussolini Deeply Satisfied</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini boarded the battleship Praia today and reviewed the simulated battle of the first and second fleets. The two simulated battles lasted about two hours. Both sides used seaplanes to spread smoke screens. After the maneuvers, the two fleets were divided into two rows and inspected by the Prime Minister in turn. The Prime Minister greatly praised and expressed satisfaction to the admirals of the two fleets (totaling 40 warships). The Prime Minister also issued the following proclamation to the two fleets: "The maneuvers after the completion of this year's training show an unprecedented effectiveness. I express my deep satisfaction and deeply feel that this year's twelfth-year maneuvers have taken another step towards completing the harmonious path of spirit and martial power. This is indeed a manifestation of the country's strong power." (8th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>American Navy Invention</p>
<h3>High-Speed Aircraft</h3>
<p>Twenty-Three Already in Production</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today that the United States Navy has invented a maritime aircraft with a high speed that can fly hundreds of miles. The structure of the aircraft is currently being kept secret. It is said that the speed of the aircraft is far beyond that of bombers, and it can also be used for combat and bombing, as well as reconnaissance and bombing of enemy fleets. Its combat power is comparable to that of reconnaissance aircraft. The Navy Department has 23 of these new aircraft under construction, and another 23 are being rebuilt. The Navy aircraft currently stationed in Hawaii, which recently flew non-stop from San Francisco to Honolulu, are also being upgraded. Their speed averages 130 miles per hour. This record-breaking aircraft, after further modification, will definitely lead the world in high-speed flight, and its direct flight capability is also unmatched by other aircraft.

<p>Hitler</p>
<h3>Announces General Amnesty</h3>
<p>Conspiracy to Rebel Not Included in Amnesty</p>
<p>President and Prime Minister's Powers Combined</p>
<p>Public Referendum Already Assured</p>
<p>(Berlin) President and Prime Minister Hitler has ordered a general amnesty for thousands of political prisoners in prisons and detention camps. This is a new initiative by Hitler after taking office as the head of Germany. Political prisoners who defamed Hitler personally or the government, or damaged the dignity of Germany, are all included in the amnesty. Radical elements of the National Socialist Party, except those who have committed riot, terrorist movement, or conspiracy to rebel, are not included in the scope of the amnesty. Stormtrooper leaders and secondary government officials who have been arrested or are under investigation due to the June 30th incident are regarded as the second category and are not eligible for the special benefits of the amnesty. Hitler has also ordered the investigation of criminals in detention camps, and declared that if the criminals can guarantee that they will no longer oppose the current government, they can be given a chance to rehabilitate themselves. The amnesty order also stipulates that the masterminds and others in the June 30th incident will be given a lenient investigation to allow for a lenient verdict. (9th National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) With the offices of German President and Prime Minister now held by Hitler alone, the German government has the opportunity to announce a general amnesty. A law will be issued tonight granting an amnesty. Not only will some political prisoners be pardoned, but this move by the Popular Will government almost says that the government is already assured of the result of the public vote on August 19th to approve the merger of the offices of President and Prime Minister. According to this law, anyone convicted of defaming Hitler can be pardoned. This amnesty applies to anyone sentenced to less than six months imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 marks, and to first-time offenders. However, crimes of treason, disclosure of military secrets, attempted assassination, and possession of weapons are not included in the amnesty. The regulations concerning the detention of suspects will be amended, secondary criminals can be spared, and the cases of those arrested for the Rohm affair will also be re-examined. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is scheduled to hold a public referendum on August 19th to vote on the law that allows Hitler to hold the powers of both President and Prime Minister. The propaganda campaign is about to begin, and Propaganda Minister Goebbels is scheduled to broadcast a speech on August 13th, before the end of the national mourning period on August 16th. Hitler is scheduled to speak to the public on August 17th. (9th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Yuguan British Troop Exercise Incident</h3>
<p>The Yuguan British troop exercise incident has attracted attention for more than ten days. British and Japanese soldiers faced each other during the exercise, as if in a state of war. There was once a rumor that a British soldier was injured by a stray bullet from the Japanese side, and the situation was serious. However, it was later reported that the British troop exercise had ended. Both the British and Japanese sides claimed that the rumor of a British soldier being injured was untrue and denied it.</p>
<p>We believe that even if a British soldier was accidentally injured, it is a trivial issue and has nothing to do with the overall situation. Even at the current stage, the diplomatic relations between the two countries will not be broken due to this local exercise incident. What is incomprehensible is that a mere few hundred British soldiers are conducting routine exercises under the serious vigilance of the Japanese side. It is obvious that it is not enough to endanger the existence of Manchukuo. The Kwantung Army's advocacy of opposition is unnecessarily making a mountain out of a molehill. If it is said that the Kwantung Army is doing so out of resentment for the policy of non-recognition by various countries and is deliberately making things difficult, then its impact will only increase unnecessary antipathy. What good will it do for Manchukuo? Moreover, after the September 18th Incident, countries such as Britain and France still enjoy extraterritoriality rights in Manchuria. The Japanese themselves still occupy the Liaodong Peninsula and the South Manchuria Railway zone. All these facts are based on and justified by Chinese-foreign treaties. Now, the British troop exercise and the repeated actions of the Japanese troops in the Pingjin area are based on the Boxer Protocol. If a Kwantung Army that does not bear the mission of international diplomacy must insist on its prejudice, saying that certain treaties between China and foreign countries (including Japan) can be applied to Manchukuo, while others cannot, then it is certain that the countries concerned will not remain silent, and will also put their own governments in what position. Now, let us take a step back and assume that the Kwantung Army generally has the power to speak for Manchukuo in terms of law and fact. Then, it is tantamount to admitting that Manchukuo is not an independent country. Since Manchukuo is not an independent country, and the Japanese do not recognize it as a vassal state, then it goes without saying that it is not entitled to have a fixed border. If the Kwantung Army knows that Manchukuo is not entitled to have a fixed border, and yet deliberately creates disputes over the Sino-"Manchu" border, then how will it justify itself?</p>
<p>Moreover, we would also like to add a word. The British military general this time said that the area outside the Great Wall is Chinese territory, and notified our Shanhaiguan Special Public Security Bureau of the exercise location and subjects. The propriety of his handling is obvious to the world. However, the Boxer Protocol allows various countries to station troops in several designated locations to protect the "capital" to the sea passage, so as to avoid any interruption. The main purpose is to guarantee the security of the embassy area in Dongjiaominxiang to avoid a repeat of the Boxer Rebellion. Now that the Chinese people have absolutely no intention or fact of blindly rejecting foreigners, and the capital has moved south to Nanjing on the Yangtze River with water and land transportation, the so-called embassy area in Dongjiaominxiang has no meaning to continue to exist. Various countries, in view of international practice and friendship with China, have the need to withdraw their troops as soon as possible. It is not possible to use unequal treaties as a talisman. Moreover, China has been bound by unequal treaties for more than eighty years. Although we are heartbroken by these countless shackles, our pursuit of liberation has always been carried out with open and aboveboard means. Before the treaty obligations are lifted, we have always faithfully fulfilled them without any change. What we expect from our friendly nations is only that they faithfully fulfill the treaty obligations related to us. However, since the September 18th Incident, the contracting parties of the so-called League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have all evaded each other, abandoning their obligations. As a result, the pain of unequal treaties is borne by us alone, and the benefits of equal treaties are not shared with us. When implementing unequal treaties, they are afraid of China's demise. When fulfilling equal treaties, they despise China's existence. The true face of international treaties has come to this. Do those of our friendly nations who enjoy the rights of unequal treaties have any feelings in their hearts?</p>
<p>Speech by the Associated Press Far East Manager</p>
<h3>Mostly War in the Far East</h3>
<p>Results of Japan's Military and Economic Aggression</p>
<p>Former Associated Press Far East Manager, Mr. Von Meier, gave a speech today at the annual Current Affairs Conference, stating that the Far East situation contains many elements of war, and the tendency towards peace is gradually disappearing. Mr. Von Meier said that the future of the Far East depends entirely on the development of the following four recent situations: (1) Japan's unilateral creation of "Manchukuo"; (2) Anglo-Japanese trade war; (3) Philippine independence and its consequences; (4) Washington Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>The most important of these is the "Manchukuo" problem, which indicates Japan's determination to expand its power in northern Asia. Japanese people generally claim that this expansion is not territorial aggression, but they cannot deny that it is economic aggression. Moreover, they cannot deny that every time Japanese economic power develops in northern Asia, it invariably uses force to maintain its gains. Taking Manchuria as an example, the Japanese still claim that the use of force is to compel the Chinese and Manchurian authorities to complete their newly established economic agreements. The Japanese believe that China has violated these agreements and deprived the Japanese of their rights. However, the reason why China is unwilling to recognize them is that these agreements were obtained by force. Therefore, Japan disregards everything and still uses force to remove the so-called "treacherous" Chinese authorities and replace them with the so-called "trustworthy" "Manchukuo." In order to ensure that "Manchukuo" is trustworthy, Japan is doing its best to ensure that the Japanese control all its military, political, and economic powers. This Japanese plan has been very successful in Manchuria, but whether it can be effective elsewhere is another question. Researchers of the Far East issue believe that Japan will replicate this model near Siberia, Vladivostok, and Kamchatka, because Japan's position there is similar to that in Manchuria. Japan also has agreements with Soviet Russia, which allow the Japanese to fish in Soviet territorial waters. The Japanese have repeatedly claimed that Soviet Russia is untrustworthy, so if there is an opportunity, Japan may also create a country similar to Manchukuo in the Siberian coastal province. Japanese authorities absolutely deny this, saying that Japan's economic relations in Siberia are far less significant than in Manchuria, and the Russo-Japanese agreements are not as important as the Sino-Japanese agreements regarding Manchuria. Furthermore, the historical background is very different. The Russo-Japanese War broke out because of the Manchurian problem. Although Japan also sent troops to Siberia in 1918, it was incomparable to the Russo-Japanese War. Some people believe that it seems more likely that Japan will implement this plan in Mongolia, because the border between Manchuria and Mongolia is complex, and Japan has repeatedly tried to get Mongolian princes to support the organization of "Manchukuo." Many agreements have now been established, and disputes may arise in the future. The Japanese side also dismisses this as pure speculation, saying that the boundaries of Manchuria will naturally be clarified in the future, and the relations between Inner and Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia will also be resolved. As it stands, Russia and Japan will definitely not go to war over Mongolia, and Russia can emulate Japan in Mongolia before Japan takes action, creating a country friendly to Russia, and Japan will be helpless.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Japanese trade war is the result of the European War and the Washington Conference. The European War made Japan a first-class industrial and commercial power, and the Washington Conference dissolved the Anglo-Japanese alliance. As a result, the two countries have become fierce competitors in Asian and world markets. Japan benefited greatly from the European War because countries had no time to engage in industry and commerce. It took the opportunity to revitalize factories and expand shipping. Therefore, although Britain had long occupied the Asian cotton textile market, it could not compete with Japan in this regard. Even in Manchester, the base of British cotton textiles, the price of Japanese products was lower than that of British goods. The area where Britain suffered the most losses was India. In 1931, Japanese goods almost occupied the Indian market, leaving no room for British goods. Britain then announced the abolition of the Indo-Japanese trade agreement, and Japan agreed to limit exports to India. After several negotiations, a compromise was reached. Japan claims that Britain is sparing no effort to create difficulties for Japanese goods. Even the League of Nations' refusal to recognize "Manchukuo" and China's anti-Japanese movement are all instigated by Britain behind the scenes. Therefore, the current situation between Britain and Japan in the Far East is quite volatile.</p>
<p>The results of the Philippine issue after the United States approved independence are quite important. China is now in a state of panic because the islands in the Pacific Ocean under Japanese mandate have largely surrounded China's gateway. If the Philippines are added, there will be no way out. After the United States withdraws from the Philippines, Japan will inevitably occupy it, which has become inevitable in the minds of the Chinese. The economic power of the Japanese in the Philippines is already considerable. If political control is added in the future, it will become a second "Manchukuo." This statement is based on the dissatisfaction of the Chinese with Japan, but the Japanese side also feels a kind of uneasiness. They believe that after the Philippines becomes independent, it will change the current situation in Asia, and Japan has not yet resolved the northern issue, so it has no time to take care of it. If other countries engage in any political activities in the Philippines, how can Japan sit idly by? Moreover, Britain and the Netherlands also feel that this tendency toward independence has a risk of spreading because their territories are close to the Philippines, so it is difficult to predict the future situation. As for the results of the Washington Conference, it is still not possible to fully assess them. Japan is planning to abolish the existing naval ratio, and as for the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity, the Chinese side believes that it has long been torn up by Japan. Japan absolutely denies this, and other countries have not given up on it, but the so-called treaty is actually equivalent to waste paper. At this time of global turmoil, with increasingly fierce economic competition, the weak countries of Asia are in danger of being crushed like eggs. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Nationalizes Silver</h3>
<p>Specifies 50.01 Cents per Ounce in U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>New York Silver Market Futures Trading Halted as a Result</p>
<p>Silver Imports Valued Over $100 Require Consular Certificate</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt announced the nationalization of silver. (Reuters Urgent Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) An executive order stipulates that in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, silver is to be nationalized at a price of 50.01 cents per ounce. Silver market futures trading was halted immediately due to this order. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued an order today stating that all silver imported into the United States, with a value of more than $100, must have a consular certificate. The order is similar to the recently promulgated regulations managing gold. However, silver bars in transit and silver goods that are imported and then re-exported are not subject to this restriction. The Treasury Secretary stated that the purpose of issuing the order is to collect statistics on silver imports into the United States. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Since August 1st, the price of silver has risen sharply by one penny. All sectors here are now paying attention to this matter, and are discussing the impact of the rise in silver prices on the purchasing power of the East, and the future trend of silver prices. People in the silver camp all say that the United States is still the pivot of the overall situation. The U.S. government has recently been buying silver in large quantities here and in New York at gradually increasing prices, so India has also slightly increased its purchases, while China has sold it. However, it is now heard that the supply in London is already limited. If the U.S. authorities continue to purchase, the market price will continue to rise. However, experts advise caution, saying that once the United States stops buying, the price of silver will plummet. Even if New York speculators purchase Indian silver reserves, many positions remain open, and it cannot be guaranteed that the market price will not fall when the United States stops buying.

<h3>U.S. Drought Affects Cotton Harvest</h3>
<p>Decrease of 25% Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>Production Control Not Necessarily Production Restriction</p>
<p>Bankhead Act Clauses Must Still Be Implemented Next Year</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Agriculture announced that this year's cotton harvest is expected to reach 9,195,000 bales, a decrease of 3,852,000 bales compared to last year, a decrease of 25%. This is also a decrease of 5,480,000 bales compared to the average from 1928 to 1932. It is the lowest amount since 1921, when the cotton harvest was below 8 million bales. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Undersecretary of Agriculture, Mr. Wallace, stated today that American cotton may disappear from the world market in 1935. The difficulty facing American cotton production is whether to continue producing enough cotton so that the country can export 8 million bales of cotton as in the past, or to withdraw from the world cotton market altogether and only produce enough for domestic use. Normally, world consumption of American cotton is 14.8 million bales, of which 8 million bales are never exported. If farmers are willing to maintain their position in the 1935 world market, the government has the necessity of canceling production restrictions. After the Food Report Committee announced the cotton statistics for August this morning, Wallace immediately held a lengthy meeting with officials from the Department of Agriculture. The above statement was released after the meeting. The published figures, only 9,195,000 bales of cotton, were far from what the Department of Agriculture had initially expected, so Wallace immediately convened senior officials from the Department of Agriculture to discuss the matter after the number was announced. Wallace's attitude is that the cotton issue should be handled by the farmers themselves. The cotton production in 1934 was beyond expectations. If requested by the planters, the government may cancel the mandatory restrictions of the Bankhead Act. The decision of the Department of Agriculture was greatly unexpected, because the Department of Agriculture stated after the meeting that it would be a great mistake not to maintain 10 million bales of cotton within the limits of the Bankhead Act. It is rumored that the Agricultural Adjustment Administration is deeply afraid of causing resentment among the producers if it does not express anything, because the cotton producers voluntarily restrict cotton production because they expect the benefits after restricting production. However, officials from the Department of Agriculture sometimes solemnly stated that production control is not necessarily production restriction. Mr. Isakil, Wallace's economic advisor, told the American Cooperative Society that our goal must ultimately focus on more production to supply a richer life in everyone's desires. Some responsible parties insist on increasing cotton production in 1935, so that the production amount is priced between 12,500,000 bales and 13,000,000 bales. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Heatwave Ravages the United States</h3>
<p>Temperature as High as 115 Degrees</p>

<p>(New York) Since the United States was invaded by the heatwave, the total number of deaths has reached 1,500. Now, a new heatwave is attacking, originating from the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains, and extending to the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico, so the number of deaths is increasing rapidly. Severe gales are raging in several places, and crops and livestock have suffered a lot of damage, so the disaster is becoming more serious. Chicago authorities have already slaughtered about a million heads of cattle, and are now purchasing another 850,000 heads to be slaughtered. It is believed that another 5 million heads of cattle will have to be sacrificed in the future. Currently, several cities are extremely hot. The temperature in Wharton, Washington, reached 114 degrees, Kansas City and Missouri both reached 108 degrees, and Springfield reached 105 degrees. The Washington Rural Loan Office has now designated Oklahoma as an emergency relief area, and can request food loans. The bureau currently has lending locations in 21 states, totaling 993 counties. Grain prices in Chicago soared today, creating a new record, because speculators, after receiving news of poor harvests, rushed to buy. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>

Today's gathering was organized to commemorate Dr. Dollfuss. Many government officials also attended. When Prime Minister Schuschnigg gave his speech, he said that the government cannot reconcile with those who murdered Dr. Dollfuss, but only wishes to shake hands with all patriotic workers. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>A grand ceremony was held today in Vienna's "King Square" to commemorate the late Prime Minister Dollfuss. No less than 100,000 people participated. Prime Minister Schuschnigg denounced the crimes of the insurgents, praised Dollfuss's achievements, and urged the Austrian people to unite to support the independent and free Austria, as a guarantee of European culture and peace. After Schuschnigg's speech, Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg took the stage. Starhemberg described Dollfuss's spirit of hard work and sacrifice, and vehemently denounced the crimes of the assassins. He said, "This modern method of killing comes from outside the Austrian border. Their actions border on barbarism, trying to force Austria to submit to them. What is evil is that we have come to understand the moral value of National Socialism after the June 30th incident, so we are willing to resist it in the spirit of Dollfuss." Starhemberg also said, "Some people have praised the assassination of Dollfuss, saying that it is in line with lofty ideals and that the behavior borders on chivalry. This is a fallacy against reason. The assassination is an act of banditry. How can it be praised?" (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Mysterious Movements of Waldu</h3>
<p>Archduke Waldu of the old Austrian royal family, from the Danish capital, arrived here by car from the port of Esbjerg, signing his name as Count Polavischnekberger. He intends to go to Sweden and Norway from here, and then return to Belgium. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome Archduke Waldu of the Austrian Habsburg family arrived safely in the Italian city of Viareggio today, a famous summer resort in the Mediterranean. After Waldu arrived here, he temporarily resided in the villa of his uncle's family, the Bourbon-Parma family. Archduke Waldu is the eldest son of the former Austrian Emperor Karl, and is the person most strongly desired to reclaim the thrones of Austria and Hungary amidst the restoration voices. His mother, the deposed Empress Zita, will also arrive here soon. Therefore, rumors that the Austrian royal family intends to contact Italy for a marriage alliance to make a preliminary step for the restoration of the Habsburg royal family have become even more prevalent.

<h3>Papen's Mission to Austria</h3>
<p>Claims to Be Carrying Out the Late President's Wishes</p>
<p>Seeking to Restore Normal Relations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Ambassador to Austria, Mr. von Papen, told a Reuters reporter today that I have received this mission in order to fulfill it in its meaning and spirit, because I know that the relaxation of tension in Europe depends on the realization of this mission, and I can use this to serve the country. Papen then said that the Prime Minister sent him a letter on July 26, explaining the work he should do as ambassador to Austria. Papen then quoted the words in the last letter sent to him by the late President Hindenburg, who signed the letter, saying that the reason for appointing him as the German diplomatic representative to Vienna was "because I hope that you can restore the good relations that our people have with the Austrian people on a daily basis. They are of the same race as us. I wish you success in carrying out this responsible work." Papen also said that this order is also a will at the same time, and there is no need to add anything to it. Papen ended his speech with the words "Hail Hitler."

<p>Tax on Foreign Rice to Relieve Rural Areas</p>
<h3>Still Needs Overall Planning</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) Rural Reconstruction Association member Gu Xinyi sent a letter to attend the grain control conference. According to him, the outflow of rice and grain from Shanghai has been very strong recently. The reason is that Nanjing, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other places are concentrated in Shanghai for procurement. Taking Jiangxi Province as an example, this time there are as many as one million dan [a unit of dry measure] purchased in Shanghai, which has caused the rice price in Shanghai to rise daily. Foreign rice imports have recently reached 3 million dan. At the current time of demand from all parties, injecting this quantity can also suppress rice prices a lot. Otherwise, it would have already soared to the highest peak. However, foreign rice imports must be limited, otherwise it may affect the entire rural economy in the future. The government authorities should pay attention to it. Gu also said that the foreign rice import tax should be changed by the government at any time. If there is a need for foreign rice, the tax rate should be reduced. When the price of foreign rice is extremely high, imports should be prohibited, and the import tax should be collected according to regulations. The current fixed method should be reconsidered: (1) When the price of foreign rice rises to 6-7 yuan, the import tax should be completely exempted to prevent the selling price from increasing due to taxation. (2) When the price of foreign rice rises to 9 yuan, the tax should be halved to slightly restrict it. (3) If it continues to rise to more than 10 yuan, the full tax should be collected or even the original tax rate should be increased to prevent large-scale imports. This method will be presented to the Central Government by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for adoption. (Special Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Current Situation of the Puppet Organization Under Japanese Rule</h3>
<p>All Manchukuo Puppet Troops Commanded by Japanese Officers</p>
<p>State Councilors Hold All Real Power in Political Affairs</p>
<p>Japanese Implements Ethnic Eradication Education in the Northeast</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: A visitor who came to Beiping from the Northeast described the recent situation in the Northeast, which is recorded in detail below:</p>
<h3>Governance Situation</h3>
<p>After the puppet Puyi claimed to be the "Emperor," the military and political affairs of the puppet organization have been completely controlled by the Japanese.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding military affairs, the puppet military department is the highest military organ. In addition to commanding all "Manchukuo" puppet troops, it also governs the Xiangwei Army Corps Headquarters, the Navy River Defense Fleet Command, the Central Military Training Office, the Horse Administration Bureau, the Jing'an Army, etc. The "Man" troops throughout the territory of the puppet organization are under the constant surveillance of the Japanese army, and most of the officers are Japanese, who exercise full command authority, so that there is no freedom of movement. The military strength is estimated at 26 mixed brigades, each brigade has two regiments, and each regiment has three battalions. Those stationed in Jilin have two battalions per regiment, totaling about 100,000 people. The Japanese army stationed in the Northeast has one division in Fengtian, one division and two gendarmerie regiments in Jilin (the puppet capital), two divisions in Heilongjiang and northern Manchuria, and one division in Rehe, totaling more than 100,000 people. Moreover, the number of Japanese veterans and immigrants in Dongbian County is no less than 200,000. Their goal is probably against Russia. All new-style firearms used by the puppet army have been confiscated by the Japanese, and there are no machine guns or artillery. The scale of the Fengtian Arsenal is the largest in China, and it is now operating according to Japanese plans. The navy has only recently built two 50-ton gunboats and four 14-ton gunboats in the River Defense Fleet, which can be completed soon. As for all technical construction projects in the puppet state, such as military surveys and military maps, they are all specified in the Japan-Manchukuo Agreement and are the responsibility of Japan.</p>
<p>(B) In terms of political affairs, the organization of various ministries and departments of the puppet state is the same as during Puyi's tenure as puppet executive, except that the title of director-general has been changed to minister. The anomalies are: (1) The Japanese, in the name of state councilors, control the overall political affairs of the puppet state. The current state councilor, Usa Katsuo, occupies the position of Zheng Xiaoxu, the prime minister of the puppet state. His seal cannot endorse the political affairs of the state without Usa's agreement. (2) The establishment of a general affairs department in each agency to control all administrative affairs of the puppet state. (3) The establishment of councilors in local administrative agencies to control local administration. All county administrations in the Northeast are measures implemented by the councilors.</p>
<h3>Social Conditions</h3>
<p>(A) Transportation: Since occupying the four northeastern provinces, Japan has worked hard to manage transportation. Last year, an agreement was concluded between the puppet state and the South Manchuria Railway to operate the existing railways under entrustment. The entire territory's Fengshan, Shenhai, Jichang, Jihai, Jihui, Jidun, Taoang, Qike, Taosuo, and Huhai nine lines have all been handed over to Japan. In addition, the South Manchuria Railway is rushing to build the Duntu line between Dunhua and Tumen, the Haike line between Keshan and Hailun, and the Labin line between Lafa and Harbin. Other harbors, waterway transportation, and all related businesses are also operated by the Japanese.</p>
<p>(B) Education: There are 11,395 elementary schools, 190 middle schools, 67 vocational schools, and 123 normal schools in the four northeastern provinces. Recently, there have been more additions. They are now full of Japanese teachers, and many are Japanese principals. The curriculum focuses on Japanese language, and it is also mixed with the so-called Wangdao (Kingly Way) ideology and the glorious history of Japan, etc., in order to erase the national character of our 30 million compatriots.</p>
<p>(C) Rural Conditions: Nineteen out of ten people in the Northeast are immigrants from Hebei and Shandong provinces, so farmers are the backbone of the people in the Northeast. After the September 18th Incident, farmers could not bear the oppression and trampling of the Japanese police and plainclothes detectives. At the same time, due to the armed immigration of Japanese and Koreans, they had to migrate to avoid them.</p>
<p>(D) Commercial Conditions: The Northeast has already become a market exclusively for Japan. Japanese goods are everywhere. Occasionally, there are Western goods or Russian goods such as calico, kerosene, etc., but due to heavy taxes and high prices, they cannot compete with Japanese goods. As for domestic goods, in addition to native cloth, Jilin ginseng, pork, lamb, and beef, chickens and ducks are also mostly transported from Russia. Fruits such as watermelons, peaches, apricots, apples, pears, etc., are transported from Dalian and Taiwan. Factories in various places are generally controlled by the Japanese. The large Chinese businesses in the Northeast have closed down one after another, so the once prosperous ports are gradually becoming desolate. Only opium dens, brothels, and small restaurants are still thriving. Apart from these three, there is no commercial activity to speak of. (7th)</p>
<p>Flooding on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway</p>
<h3>Repairs Completed at Damaged Sections</h3>
<p>丨Full Traffic Resumed on the 3rd丨</p>
<p>Ping Report: This year, Sui Province has experienced many days of excessive rain, causing significant flooding, unprecedented in the last twenty years. The Ping-Sui Railway suffered particularly heavy damage. Partial disruption to traffic began on July 6th, and after heavy rains on the 13th, the damage became severe. After active repairs, all sections except for a landslide at Sandaoying, which still required extensive work, were fully repaired and traffic resumed on the 23rd. Unexpectedly, on the 25th, another heavy rain occurred, causing further damage to the newly repaired sections, even more extensive than before. Through continuous day and night repairs by the construction teams, and despite repeated heavy rains during the work period, full traffic was finally restored on the 3rd of this month. A summary of the key repairs on each section is provided below. As for a fundamental solution, it is said that the route will need to be changed, as the current route runs alongside the river, or even built directly within the riverbed. Therefore, it is impossible to prevent damage during major floods. The line has been damaged twice before, in the 13th and 18th years of the Republic. If the line is not changed, future troubles are inevitable. (1) Between Pingdiquan and Sanchakou: near Road House No. 168, west of Pingdiquan Station, the roadbed was adjacent to the Ba Wang River. This time, the river changed its course, washing away the original earth dam and directly hitting the roadbed, causing three breaks. Three temporary roads have now been repaired, and traffic resumed on the 17th. (2) Between Zhuozishan and Fushengzhuang: near the distant signal west of Zhuozishan Station, the stone dam at the north end of Bridge No. 493 was washed away. The roadbed west of the bridge was completely destroyed, for a length of approximately two li. Repairs were completed on the 23rd. (3) Between Fushengzhuang and Sandaoying: A. Bridge No. 501, west of Fushengzhuang, has been prone to silting or sand covering the tracks during rains over the years, preventing traffic. This year, the downstream route had been changed, and a new bridge was being built, along with a stone dam upstream. However, before the project was completed, heavy rains washed away the new dam and damaged the earthworks on the new line. The dam was then rebuilt using reinforced concrete to ensure its strength, and the earthworks on the new line were repaired. Water now flows smoothly through the new bridge without posing a risk of collapse. B. Bridge No. 509, west of Fushengzhuang, previously had insufficient openings. This year, two 12-foot culverts were added to the west side of the original bridge. Before the bridge work was completed, the riverbed had not yet been constructed when heavy floodwaters scoured out the riverbed, causing the bridge abutments and piers to collapse. The new earthworks at both ends were also washed away. In order to resume traffic quickly, the bridge openings were temporarily filled in. If there are no major floods, it should be safe. C. From Road House No. 197 eastward at Sandaoying, the route runs along the mountain. During this flood, the hillside collapsed for a length of 1100 feet, overlooking a deep river. It was impossible to bypass the route, so the mountainside had to be cut away to allow traffic to pass. Work began on July 20th, and efforts were made day and night to complete the repairs and resume traffic on the 31st. (The deepest cut into the mountain was 26 feet). (4) Between Sandaoying and Qixiaying: A. A total of five sections of roadbed were washed away between the two stations. The fourth section, near Road House No. 201, was the most dangerous. The first three sections were quickly repaired with temporary roads after the first major flood. The fourth section, after a large temporary road was constructed, was further damaged. The temporary road was then moved further away from the river, bypassing the back of Road House No. 201 to avoid the water. B. 1600 feet of roadbed were washed away west of Bridge No. 529, east of Qixiaying. The original wooden pile bridge with two openings and Bridge No. 530 were also destroyed. The upstream stone dam was breached, and the rushing water made repairs extremely difficult. A new earthen dam was built upstream to stop the flow of water, and a reinforced concrete dam was quickly built at the site of the original stone dam, while the roadbed was being filled in. Fortunately, the weather cleared up, and work was completed and traffic resumed on the 3rd of this month. (5) Between Qixiaying and Taobqi: The roadbed west of Erdahe Shantong, which originally ran along the mountain, was washed away for a length of about 700 feet. Overlooking a deep river, there was no place to obtain soil for filling. Mountain cutting was combined with temporary road repairs, and the repairs were completed and traffic resumed on July 23rd.

The German flag and the Nazi Party flag were hung high on both sides of the hall. Three pairs of white candles were lit on the stage, and many flowers and trees were arranged. The first ten rows below the stage were reserved for Chinese officials, rows eleven to thirteen for foreign envoys, and the remaining seats for Chinese and Western guests and newspaper reporters. After the funeral music was played, German Pastor Oelschlager officiated and led everyone in singing three memorial songs, which were very mournful. German Minister Trautmann and his wife were even moved to tears. Finally, a prayer was recited, and the ceremony ended at 12:07 p.m. Chinese and Western guests exited the hall in order. German Minister Trautmann and his wife, Counselor Müllerre, and Rosen stood at the door of the hall, and when Chinese and Western guests exited, Trautmann and others shook hands with each guest and thanked them. Minister Trautmann wore a full dress uniform and a black veil, and Mrs. Trautmann wore a black veil and black gloves. The ceremony was quite solemn. By 12:25 p.m., all the guests had left. (7th)</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Report by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Geng Ya</h3>
<p>Qing Province's Best Image is Not Planting Harmful Flowers</p>
<p>On the morning of the 26th, the weather was cold, and even wearing fur felt chilly. Departing from Zhangjia Town, the initial stretch was lined with elms and willows, providing shade, making pedestrians feel as if they were walking under bean and melon trellises. Villagers piled stones into pillars, ranging in height from four to five feet, numbering in the thousands. The tallest one had a wooden board inserted next to it, inscribed with the words: "Jade Emperor's Imperial Envoy Lei Chun, stopping torrential rain, suppressing demons," etc. Qinghai's high altitude weather, storms, and heavy rain are natural phenomena. With underdeveloped science, human effort is difficult to mitigate. Ignorant and foolish people then turn to the gods for help, which is the inevitable trend. If forests were cultivated on the four mountains, moderating the climate, the disasters of rain and hail could be reduced. In recent years, Qinghai has advocated afforestation on the plains, but has not considered the benefits and needs of planting trees in the mountains, which is truly regrettable. Qinghai's climate is dry and there is a trend of turning fertile land into desert. If human effort is used to save it, afforestation is the only way. Once the forests are established, they will conserve water sources and moderate the climate, which can be effective. Ten li to Baima Temple, where Hui, Han, and Tibetan people live together, totaling over forty families. Each teahouse and noodle shop has a village regulation posted, stating: "If there are disputes between Han, Hui, and Tibetan people, the fine is twelve yuan. Whether residents or pedestrians, if anyone sings songs near the village, they will be beaten one hundred and twenty times with willow branches." The temple is built against a steep cliff, its shape somewhat resembling the stone Buddha temple of Yungang. Suddenly, I saw over twenty Tibetan people, each holding wooden talisman stakes, and dog-head banners, etc., loudly beating drums and gongs, chanting the six-character mantra, circling the stone fortress three times, and shouting three loud sounds, then going elsewhere. I asked about their purpose, and they answered, "To ward off thunder, rain, and hail." At that time, Mr. Parr and Mr. Smith of the British American Tobacco Company were taking photographs. When they saw this, they asked me, "What country are they from?" I replied, "They are British." A Tibetan man seemed surprised and said, "Oh, are they the British from the After-Tibet side?" I replied, "Yes, are you afraid of them?" The Tibetan man said, "We are not afraid of the British or Americans, we only hate the Japanese, because Japan has seized our Northeast Provinces and Rehe, and also killed countless of our volunteers and civilians. Sir, I heard that Japan is only as big as our Sichuan Province. Then we can go and fight them. Ten people fight one of them, that should be enough, right?" I clapped to show my approval. He then asked me, "Sir, are you afraid of foreigners?" I replied, "Of course not." "If you are not afraid, why are you wearing yellow foreign shorts?" I was momentarily embarrassed, so I replied tactfully, "These are made of domestic materials, and I wear them while walking to keep cool. If you think the style is not good, I will change them in Xining." When they heard this, they shouted in unison, "Good, good, this is a patriotic compatriot." Then they dispersed with a hubbub. Nearby Tibetan people, because they live together with Han and Hui people, although they still believe in ghosts and gods, their knowledge of national affairs is not lagging behind, which is quite commendable.</p>
<p>Ten li to Caojiabao, and another ten li to Gaozhaibao, the terrain gradually rises, as if climbing a slope. Another ten li to Xiaoxiakou, where there is a bridge crossing the river, marking the boundary between Huzhu and Xining east and west. There are about ten families living on both sides of the bridge. The women wear bonnets, either black or white, similar to nurses and missionaries in hospitals. Those working in the fields wear white cloth sunhats, shaped like sieves, or simply wear scarves, which are also quite clean. The men mostly enjoy playing chess, or like to play hand-held games, even forgetting their farm work, and wasting their time on these two things. There is a small temple, dedicated to the Wind God and Rain Master, which is already badly damaged. Xiaoxia’s cliffs stand facing each other, thousands of ren high. The Huangshui River flows in the middle, its current swift and terrifying. The mountain path is narrow, and horses cannot walk abreast. The east is called "Xiaoxia Kou," and the west is called "Wangxia." If one defends this place, one person can be worth a hundred. If this is lost, the other places will inevitably be lost one after another. This is what military strategists call "fighting in a hole." Five li to the airfield, the field is wide and boundless. In the evening, I entered Xining City. In total, from Lanzhou to Xining, I traveled six horse stations, a total of 460 li. If traveling by car, detouring through Yongdeng (i.e., Pingfan), it can be reached in two days.</p>
<p>Qinghai was originally one of the frontier provinces. Although its culture is relatively backward, there are some good things I saw along the way that are worth mentioning. No opium poppies are planted within Qinghai. At a time when the Northwest provinces are financially exhausted and are competing to use opium poppy taxes as a means of generating revenue, Qinghai has not a single poisonous flower, which is truly commendable. If they can take it a step further, banning transportation and consumption, and benefiting the local people, it would be even more significant. This is its first good quality. Peaceful journeys, with tranquil villages, and major transportation routes, especially those where robberies are not likely to occur, is its second good quality. Water conservancy projects are distributed in various counties, greatly benefiting agricultural affairs. Its increased production and regulation of rural areas are more effective than other constructions, its third good quality. Qing Province's output of natural forests is very abundant, and it spares no effort in cultivating artificial forests. Everywhere, tall branches block the sun, and cool shade covers the land. If it can further extend to the cultivation of barren mountains, and the protection of natural forests, the future development of forestry will be even more limitless, its fourth good quality.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Harass Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Bandits Hidden in Xunwu Annihilated</p>
<p>Bandits in Wuping Attempt to Seize Rice Crops and Suffer Losses</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province have recently been rampant in western Fujian. At the same time, they secretly dispatched a force under Lin Biao to reinforce the line from Huichang to Yudu. Ye Jianying's force took the opportunity to attack Junmen. Lin Biao's force also moved west from Yudu, repeatedly invading the territory of Xinfeng. Therefore, the military situation in southern Jiangxi has suddenly become tense. Yesterday, Ye Zhao, the second division commander of the First Column stationed in Xinfeng, sent a secret telegram reporting the bandit situation in Yudu. Regarding the Second Column, after the Seventh Division repelled Ye's bandits who invaded Junmen Luotian at the end of last month, it has now stepped up its guard. According to a telegram from the Second Column headquarters yesterday, reporting the situation of bandit annihilation as follows: "According to an undated telegram from Division Commander Li Zhenliang, based on a report from Company Commander Qu Tingjian of the First Company: (1) About ten Communist bandits were discovered near Youyiejiao Market, five were killed on the spot, and three guns were captured. According to the division commander's telegram, relayed from Regiment Commander Wu Junsheng: Based on reports, a group of bandits fleeing from Dingnan hid in the Caodakeng area of Xunwu. The various battalions were ordered to dispatch a company to suppress them, but the mountainous forest was vast and nothing was found. They continued to search, and at about 3 p.m., a secret agent hired by our company reported that the entire group of bandits, numbering over a hundred, was indeed hiding in Danzhuping, ten li from Hejiao Market. As the 3rd Battalion was closer to that location, Battalion Commander Huang Shuguan was ordered to personally lead the search. A platoon was also dispatched from the troops stationed in E'zihu to intercept near Huangshashui. At 4 p.m., Battalion Commander Huang arrived at the location and made contact with the bandits, resulting in a fierce battle lasting about two hours. As a result, all levels of political commissars responsible for supervising the battle were killed, along with twenty-three bandits. Fifty-two bandits were captured. (Omission) The fleeing bandits are currently being pursued. Respectfully reported, Li Yangjing, respectfully kowtowing." Furthermore, according to a telegram from Huang Renhuan, the commander of the First Independent Division in western Fujian, based on a report from Regiment Commander Wu, over a hundred Communist bandits attacked Raoxi, about seven li east of Wuping, on the 25th, attempting to seize the farmers' rice crops. The regiment dispatched two battalions to encircle and suppress them. The bandits also stubbornly resisted, relying on the terrain. After three hours of confrontation, the Communist bandits began to flee into the mountains, with about thirty casualties along the way. Regiment Commander Wu has now returned to Wudong for guard duty. (August 4th)</p>
<p>Anhui Province</p>
<h3>Establishment of a People's Food Adjustment Committee</h3>
<p>丨Provincial Chairman Concurrently Serves as Chairman of the Committee丨</p>
<p>Anqing Communication: Anhui Province is suffering from severe drought with no rain, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Dou Xiwén, the Standing Committee member of the Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, and others, recently sent a telegram to Duan Qirui, Xu Shiying, and Wang Yitang in Lushan, requesting them to appeal to Chairman Chiang for drought relief. The province also believes that at this time of severe drought, the people's food is the primary issue. In order to provide disaster relief and maintain the people's food supply, the Anhui Provincial People's Food Adjustment Committee is being organized, and the regulations of the committee have been drafted and passed at the provincial government's regular meeting on the 7th. The key points of the regulations are as follows: The committee will be composed of the following personnel: all members of the provincial government, the provincial party affairs commissioners, three members of the Anhui Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, and three members of the Anhui Provincial Rural Cooperation Committee. The chairman will be concurrently held by the provincial government chairman, and a vice-chairman will be concurrently held by a member of the provincial government. The committee will have three groups: general affairs, investigation, and adjustment, each with a director, selected from the committee members. The drought-stricken counties under the province should each establish a branch committee for people's food adjustment, with the county magistrate as the chairman and relevant personnel and local gentry as members. The drought-stricken areas under each county may establish a sub-committee for people's food adjustment, with the district head as the chairman and relevant personnel and local gentry as members. In the future, this will be beneficial to the regulation of the people's food supply. (8th)</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Temples Used as School Buildings in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Fenglong Temple, adjacent to the Xichan Temple in this city, has been managed by the abbot of Xichan Temple, Monk Lanfeng, and used as a residence for monks. Last year, the principal of the nearby Public Second Elementary School, Zhang Yun, due to the increasing number of students and the insufficient school buildings, proposed to take over the Fenglong Temple and connect it to use as a school building. He submitted a report to the Education Bureau, which forwarded it to the Education Department for approval. However, the monks objected to this and filed a complaint against the Education Department's order. The Ministry of Interior ruled to revoke the original decision, and the temple was returned to the monks' management. However, Principal Zhang recently hired craftsmen to repair the temple and install doors and windows. The monk submitted a report to the county government to stop this. County Magistrate Jin, based on the Ministry's order, telegraphed the Education Bureau to stop the work. The school also reported to the Second Sub-Station that the monks had beaten two school workers, requesting the police to investigate. Police Inspector Lang dispatched Police Chief Qian to investigate. He only saw the monk Lanfeng tied up in the courtyard, with both sides holding to their own stories. He then sent both the principal and the monk to the County Public Security Bureau, which forwarded them to the court for review.</p>
<h3>Famous Drug Trafficker Arrested and Sent to the County</h3>
<p>Jin Zhao, a well-known trafficker of drugs and opium in Sijing, residing in the Dachang Clothing Store, was discovered by the Public Security Bureau. Special Agent Wang Yintang was dispatched with police to search the store, and a large quantity of morphine and opium was found. However, Song then summoned thugs to resist arrest and assault the police, and夺取证物, throwing the evidence out of the window and throwing lime, causing injuries to police officers Wang Qinming and others. Song escaped during the chaos. Wang returned to the bureau to report. Director He then dispatched Inspector Yan Jishi and Inspector Luo Junfen, along with detectives Xia Shengyu and others, to Sijing on the evening of the 7th, surrounding Song's front and back doors and entering the premises. Song was found lying in bed and was immediately arrested and taken back to the bureau. Inspector Luo then discovered that Special Agent Wang was suspected of taking bribes. Director He had Wang detained for questioning, and Wang confessed and returned twenty yuan in bribes. He has been sent to the county government for review along with Song.</p>
<h3>Public Petition Provincial Authorities for Thorough Investigation of Land Tax Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the land tax fraud case of Ye Zongcheng, the director of the First Land Tax Collection Office in this county, the county magistrate had Ye detained, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Wu Baohuang, the supervisor of the special education funds of the province, believed that the tax revenue was of great importance to the education funds, and had requested Director Niu to investigate the case. Director Niu has now ordered County Magistrate Jin to provide a truthful report on the matter. The report from Supervisor Wu Baohuang stated that the county of Punán, after its paddy fields were converted to land tax, had been approved to reduce collection by 40% last year, and that the 18th year of the Republic was being collected in the 22nd year. In Pubei, the paddy fields converted to land tax were being paid off by the landowners year by year, which means that the paddy fields converted to land tax in Punán were also not entirely outstanding. However, Director Ye of the First Land Tax Collection Office, when reporting the autumn survey in the 22nd year, included all 119,000 mu of paddy fields converted to land tax in both Pubei and Punan under the outstanding tax item, encroaching upon the 60% of the tax revenue from the paddy fields converted to land tax in Pubei since the 18th year, and the tax revenue from the paddy fields converted to land tax in Punan that had already been paid since the 18th year, which was a very large amount. The county government has now appointed Yang Yunwen as the director of the First Collection Office, but has not thoroughly investigated Director Ye's encroachment of tax revenue, so a request for instructions has been submitted. The land tax of each county is related to the essential needs of provincial education. If the presented report is true, the loss to the special funds is very large and a thorough investigation and handling is urgently needed. The county magistrate is ordered to investigate why the paddy fields converted to land tax in Pubei were included with those in Punan under the item of outstanding tax. What are the actual facts? Did the former director embezzle tax revenue? A truthful report should be submitted immediately, along with a guarantee from the newly appointed Director Yang regarding the special provincial education funds, and submitted for review. (Omission) It is also learned that since former Director Ye was detained, he has been treated very well in terms of food and lodging, as he is already over sixty years old. It is said that the local public has submitted petitions to the provincial authorities requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>New District Chiefs for All Counties in Suzhou Determined</h3>

<h3>Patrol Officer Xue Shoupeng Detained</h3>
<p>Patrol Officer Xue Shoupeng of the Fourth Precinct of the Third Public Security Bureau was accused by someone to the Public Security Bureau of seven charges including dereliction of duty and bribery. After Director Wang confirmed the facts, he ordered Xue's dismissal. Subsequently, because a six-round pistol issued by the Public Security Bureau was sold by Xue, Director Wang was very angry and yesterday (9th) had Xue Shoupeng detained pending review.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Southeast Transportation Expo Postponed</h3>
<p>The Southeast Transportation Expo and the Joint Opening Ceremony of the Jiangsu Provincial Jiangnan Highways, originally scheduled for September 10th of this year, have been postponed due to insufficient preparation. It has been decided to hold it from October 1st to October 10th for four days, weather permitting. After August 25th, Shen Qi, the highway director sent by the Jiangsu Construction Department, will go to Zhejiang Province to discuss the Southeast Transportation Expo. The routes for the joint opening have been determined as the Jing-Wu, Jing-Hang, Xi-Yi, Xi-Hu, and Hu-Hang routes, and then from the Jing-Hang route to the Sheng-Ju, Zhen-Cheng, Xi-Cheng, Xi-Hu, Su-Chang, and Su-Jia routes. The Xi-Hu Highway is currently under active construction and is scheduled to be completed and open to traffic before the Double Tenth Festival. The road surface must be completed by the end of the year. Before the road surface is completed, it will not be officially opened to traffic. The Zhen-Cheng Road surface is scheduled to be completed before the Double Tenth Festival and officially opened to traffic. This road can connect with the Xi-Cheng Road.</p>
<h3>Electricity Fee Dispute Escalates</h3>
<p>The Xichang Qishuyan Power Plant of the Construction Committee recently changed its business regulations and notified its users that in addition to paying the meter deposit, they must also pay an additional electricity fee deposit according to the ampere of the meter. Upon hearing the news, the users believed that the Qishuyan Plant was increasing the burden on users, violating the purpose of national public utilities, and unanimously opposed it. Sun Xixia and others published advertisements to solicit opinions from all sectors of society. In the past few days, they have received three to four hundred letters contributing opinions from all sectors, all expressing firm opposition. Jiang Zhongliang, the chairman of the Hotel Industry Association, advocated organizing a united association of electric light users to firmly fight for their rights. The Qishuyan Plant sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that it was not increasing the burden on users. However, it is heard that the reason for the plant's modification of the business regulations this time is that the current regulations require users who rent the plant's meters to pay a monthly meter rental fee in addition to paying the deposit, which is contrary to the Construction Committee's Electrical Business Regulations and is close to illegal exactions. Therefore, it is now planned to change it to an electricity fee deposit and return the meter deposit receipts. However, the users may follow the example of Peiping last year and jointly sue the plant in court for the meter rental fees collected over the years.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Implements Measures to Relieve Rural Areas</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and Department of Finance, in light of the drought disasters in the counties south of the Yangtze River, urgently wanted to understand the true situation of grain reserves in various counties, and specially appointed Yu Bingdong and Zhu Yuwu to conduct thorough investigations in various counties. Yu and Zhu arrived in Wuxi on the 3rd and, together with County Magistrate Yan, carefully investigated the county's grain reserves and the exact amount of the two-five treasury bonds stored in each district, deciding to allocate four-tenths to purchase and store grain, and organize an Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee. They then went to Wujin and Jiangyin to investigate. It is now learned that the Department of Finance, in order to fully relieve agricultural production, has decided to implement effective relief work: (1) Pilot agricultural warehouse certificates; (2) Agricultural product storage pledge; (3) Agricultural product transportation and sales. The issuance of agricultural certificates in the first item will be piloted first in Wujin and Wuxi. Farmer remittances will also be handled. After implementation, the original Land Tax Office will be abolished and replaced by the warehouse for tax collection. Therefore, Yu and Zhu returned to Wuxi again yesterday. It is said that Jiangyin's disaster relief work has achieved the best results, so the disaster situation is lighter, and the grain reserves and funds are also the most abundant compared to other counties. Yu and Zhu have now gone with Gu Shuzhi, the president of the Farmers Bank, to Dongting to inspect the warehouses operated by the Agricultural Bank. As soon as the matter is completed, they will go to Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Changshu Road Construction Causes Shopkeepers to Close</h3>
<p>In this county, the construction of highways in various villages, particularly in the southeast region, has gathered hundreds of workers, mostly from other provinces. They often create disturbances on purpose. This has been a frequent occurrence since the road construction began. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, a worker, Mr. Jia, from the Changtai Road construction project in Baimao Town, went to the market to buy two watermelons. A dispute arose over the price. Unexpectedly, the worker then led dozens of people back to the town. They first clashed with the watermelon vendors, and then started beating anyone they encountered. Because the workers were armed with kitchen knives and iron tools, no one dared to resist. The entire town was thrown into chaos, and shopkeepers closed their doors in protest. As a result, more than twenty villagers were injured, with Jin Xigen, Qian Chun, and the wife of the barber Gui Gui, suffering the most severe injuries. Later, the local defense corps attempted to mediate, but without success. Officials from the district office also fled in panic. The incident has now been reported to the county, and mediation is still underway.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Prefectural Commissioner Inspects Grain Reserves in Cheng</h3>
<p>Finance Commissioner Zhu Yuwu, accompanied by Civil Affairs Commissioner Ding Bingdong, arrived in Cheng on the 7th to oversee the management of agricultural warehouses and investigate grain reserve funds, as well as the drought situation. After meeting with County Magistrate Bao and Chen Zhisan of the Farmers Bank, it was learned that over 10,000 yuan of Jiangyin's grain reserve funds remained. The Food Management Committee has already purchased over 5,000 dan of grain. They have now reclaimed the Education Bureau's buildings to expand the granaries, and will make further purchases after the autumn harvest. As for the drought situation, it is slightly better than in other counties due to its proximity to the river. It has been decided to first establish three agricultural warehouse locations in Houteng, Lujia Bridge, and West Stone Bridge. The two commissioners were scheduled to go to Wuxi on the 8th, rest for two days, and then proceed to Wu County for investigation.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Pig Boat Capsizes in Hurricane</h3>
<p>Zhe Zilai, a pig merchant from Yigou Town in the first district of the county, purchased fifty-five piglets from Songjia Bridge in Huxi the other day and hired a boat to transport them. However, while traveling in the middle of the lake, they suddenly encountered a hurricane and the boat capsized. Fortunately, the boatman, Zhu, was familiar with the water and managed to rescue Zhe Zilai, preventing him from losing his life. However, the entire boatload of piglets was swept away by the waves, resulting in a loss of approximately 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Yu Family Embankment Nearly Collapses</h3>
<p>The Yu Family Embankment in Xinyuan, the third district of the county, was in imminent danger of collapsing at 2:00 PM on the 8th due to a howling wind, torrential rain, and surging river tides. All the men, women, and children of the entire village gathered on the embankment at this moment, standing in the wind and rain, trying to protect the embankment. Fortunately, the hurricane and torrential rain subsided after ten minutes, and the embankment did not collapse. More than ten houses and large trees within the embankment were swept away by the wind and rain, making it a great stroke of luck amidst misfortune.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Seventy-Year-Old Man Commits Suicide Due to Drought</h3>
<p>In Xizhou, a southern village in Xiaoshan, there lived a farmer named Chen Jingchun, aged seventy. He had four sons, the eldest and youngest of whom were farmers, while the others were engaged in weaving. This year, the weather has been severely dry, and the eldest son died of illness on the 1st of this month due to exhaustion from drawing water for days. The youngest son alone could not manage the field work. The old man helped for several days, but the drought persisted without rain. He still had over twenty mu of land, which was completely withered. Because the weather was so dry and sunny, and the autumn harvest seemed hopeless, the old man cried bitterly for several hours on the morning of the 7th. In the evening, he drank a bowl of salt water and committed suicide. By the time his family discovered him, he had already died.</p>

<h3>Seawall Repairs Completed, No Worries for Autumn Floods</h3>
<p>Repair of Seawall Projects in Progress</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Sets Out for Inspection</p>
<p>The seawalls of Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan, Nanhui, Shanghai and other places suffered significant damage from several typhoons and tidal surges last autumn. In addition to emergency repairs at the time, funds were raised for repairs. The seawall projects in various places are now being completed in succession, and there should be no danger of autumn floods this year. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Taicang and Baoshan Seawalls to be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>The seawalls of Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan suffered the most severe damage last autumn. Local governments and people repeatedly appealed to the provincial government, requesting funds for repairs. The provincial government approved a large sum, and since the county authorities started the repairs this spring, the Jiading side was completed last month. Taicang and Baoshan are also expected to be fully completed by the end of this month. Once the project is completed, a report will be submitted to the provincial authorities, requesting them to send personnel for inspection and acceptance.</p>
<h3>Pudong and Puxi to Start Construction Soon</h3>
<p>The seawalls of Gaoqiao in Pudong and Wusong in Puxi, which were damaged by both the January 28th Incident and the autumn typhoons, urgently need repair. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works believes that these two seawalls are crucial to the security of the city, so it has prepared a detailed plan and submitted it to the municipal government for approval. It has advertised for contractors to bid on the project, and bidding will open next week. Construction will begin immediately and must be completed before the autumn floods to avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Provincial Authorities Inspect and Accept Nanhui Seawall Project</h3>
<p>The seventy-plus li of seawalls along the coast in eastern Nanhui County were almost completely destroyed during the autumn floods last year. County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo submitted a request to the provincial government for a large sum of money, and he worked with local gentry to carry out repairs. The entire project was completed by the end of last month and has been submitted to the provincial authorities for filing. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction sent personnel to the county the other day for inspection and acceptance. The entire project was repaired very well, and there should be no danger during the autumn floods this year.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Sets Out for Inspection</h3>
<p>In order to emphasize the importance of repairing seawalls, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially hired seven gentry from Jiading, Taicang, and Baoshan, including Zhang Gongquan, Zhu Kaichou, Zhao Housheng, Jin Houcheng, Hong Shengping, Shen Siqi, and Min Ruizhi, as members of the Jiangnan Seawall Supervisory Committee. In addition to visiting various places for inspection at any time, now that the seawall projects in various places are about to be completed in succession and the autumn floods are approaching, all the committee members plan to go to Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan, and other places for a week-long inspection of the repair situation within days. It is predicted that the cities and regions near this city will be safe from danger for this year's autumn floods.</p>
<p>Gaoqiao Farmers Suffer from Drought</p>
<h3>Appeal for Removal of Old Huangpu Dyke</h3>
<p>Agricultural Association Reports on the Investigation</p>
<p>Bureau Approves Removal; Agricultural Association Responsible</p>
<p>This summer, due to the severe drought, the Gaoqiao district farmers, with their fields cracked and the autumn harvest hopeless, recently started a spontaneous trend of demolishing the high dike built by the Junpu Bureau in the Old Huangpu, hoping that the tide would flow in to irrigate the farmland. A reporter from the Great White Society, after learning of this, went to various places to investigate the details, which are described below:</p>
<h3>Reasons for Demolishing the Dyke</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Municipal Agricultural Association, since the beginning of this year's drought, villagers in various districts have been asking the municipal authorities and the Municipal Agricultural Association for quick relief. The Drought Prevention Association was immediately organized, and the Social Affairs and Public Works Bureaus worked together to implement drought relief measures. A large number of water pumps were purchased and distributed to various villages, and the Junpu Bureau and fire trucks were asked to help pump water. However, the cost was high and the effect was minimal, so it was soon stopped. The coastal areas could have been irrigated by the tide during high tide, but since the Junpu Bureau started building the dike, the tide has been blocked. Therefore, the farmers in the Gaoqiao district, in order to save themselves, resorted to demolishing the dike. After learning of this, the Municipal Party Department sent Zhang Huijun, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Tian Heqing, and the Municipal Agricultural Association sent Yu Zhenhui to investigate the truth in order to verify and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Agricultural Association Report</h3>
<p>The Municipal Agricultural Association reported to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Gaoqiao district farmers requested to demolish the dam. In order to be informed of the matter, the Association had previously reported that the Junpu Bureau was building a dam in the Old Huangpu, blocking the tide and causing insufficient water for irrigation, resulting in the drying up of branch rivers. The Association immediately reported the situation for relief, and the Bureau sent personnel to contact the Junpu Bureau, which agreed to pump water for six hours every night from the 2nd. However, the farmers still complained that the water was insufficient. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they gathered at the home of Lu Dong, a preparation member of the district agricultural association, to protest. Upon hearing the news, the Association sent personnel to the Bureau and the Municipal Government on the morning of the 4th to report and request immediate measures to pump water day and night. The Bureau and the Municipal Government then sent personnel to contact the Junpu Bureau, which agreed to pump water continuously for sixty hours starting on the evening of the 4th. On the afternoon of the same day (the 4th), Director Tian Heqing of the Bureau, together with the Association, went to investigate. When they arrived near Lingjiazhai, the farmers were gathering with gongs. They, along with Director Tian, advised them to be good. The farmers from various villages still came in groups, stating that since the construction of the dam in the Old Huangpu (which had once collapsed on the evening of July 22 and was later rebuilt), the tide has been blocked. They had hoped that the Junpu Bureau would pump water, but they were only pumping for two or three hours a day (and said that due to insufficient pumping, there was occasional muddy water mixed into the river, which easily caused blockage and was of no help). Only the Old Huangpu had water, while all other branch rivers had dried up. They also heard rumors that the Junpu Bureau was planning to fill the Old Huangpu and sell it, so they went in the morning to demolish the dam, etc. At that time, the farmers gathered in greater numbers, and together they went to the Third District and Fourth Precinct Office of Gaoqiao Town, pointing out the drying up of rivers and the withering of fields along the way. Some of them were crying in pain and shedding tears, and their situation was particularly pitiful. Director Zhan and Director Tian advised them to be kind and discussed the farmers' demands: (1) Please demolish the dam built in the Old Huangpu within three days to allow the tide to pass through; (2) Dredge the rivers; (3) Provide relief; (4) Exempt taxes. At that time, the crowd was agitated, and they had no choice but to consult with Director Tian and Director Zhan. They agreed to report the demands to the Municipal Government for approval before dispersing, threatening to gather again to appeal if the dam was not demolished within three days. They returned to Shanghai with Director Tian and reported the situation in detail. Yesterday (the 5th), they went with Director Tian to advise and supervise the installation of the East Sea water pump. The situation has been reported in detail. Please approve.</p>
<h3>Instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Received. The dam built by the Junpu Bureau in the Huangpu River is no longer needed and is being urged for removal. Since this is a common request, it should be approved for removal. However, the Association should be responsible for any water conservancy and other problems that may arise after the dam's removal. In addition to reporting the matter and the other requests, a report will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. This is the approval.</p>
<p>Hurricane Gone</p>
<h3>Yesterday was Sunny and Hot as Usual</h3>
<p>Navigation of Jianghai Vessels Returns to Normal</p>
<p>After the Pacific typhoon passed Shanghai the other day, it is now heading north. An inquiry was made to the local observatory yesterday, which stated that the report at 6:00 AM (yesterday) indicated that the storm had reached 33 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, heading north-northeast and then due north. However, the observatory continued to report at 2:00 PM that the storm had reached 35 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, heading north or north-northeast. Therefore, it is predicted that the storm was in the Yellow Sea (i.e., Haizhou) between Mokpo, Korea, at 2:00 PM. If it does not change direction and continues to blow north, it will make landfall in Andong, at the border between Korea and Liaoning. As for the rumor that there were still six degrees of wind force lingering on Dajishan outside Songkou yesterday morning, it is completely untrue. At the same time, the observatory stated that a new typhoon has occurred in the Pacific, but it is still far from land and no detailed reports have been received. As for yesterday's temperature, due to the passage of the typhoon the other day, it dropped sharply to 81.4 degrees, but yesterday it was sunny and hot as usual, with a high of 94.8 degrees and a low of 75.9 degrees, seemingly returning to the state it was three days ago. The vessels that were blocked have now entered the port one after another and have resumed their schedules. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reasons for Shuntian's Entry and Retreat</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel, after changing its route to the Yangtze River, operates between Hankou and Shanghai and to various ports in the north and south. On the 8th, the ship arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM. The ship had entered the port and sailed to Yangshupu when it suddenly turned back to the outside of Wusongkou. The company did not know the reason at the time and sent a telegram to inquire. It was not until yesterday morning that Shuntian entered the port again. According to the crew, when the ship was entering the port, it was difficult to berth at the dock due to the strong winds and turbulent waters of the Pudong River. Therefore, it turned back to Wusongkou and anchored for one night, and opened to Shanghai on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<h3>Ships Sheltering from Wind Set Sail One After Another</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Hairui Wheel, which loaded cargo from the Longhai Railway at Sunjiashan in Haizhou and set sail for Shanghai, encountered a typhoon as soon as it left the port. The ship did not dare to sail and immediately returned to Laoyao, and will set sail again today. The Beiyang regular Xinming Wheel encountered a typhoon on the way and entered Weihaiwei to take shelter. The Qihai Wheel, which was going to Fujian and was blocked in Wusong, had all set sail yesterday morning. The ships that were sheltering from the wind outside Wusongkou yesterday have entered the Pudong River one after another. Fortunately, precautions were taken in advance, so there were no accidents in this typhoon, which is also fortunate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Ferries Suspended Once</h3>
<p>The Ningbo buses on the 7th were not issued, and the Ningxing, Xinjiangtian, and other buses that returned to Shanghai after leaving the port sailed as usual yesterday. Some of the passengers who had not refunded their tickets still took the original bus to Ningbo. The Xin Beijing and Ningshao buses from Ningbo are also expected to return to Shanghai this morning. During this strong wind, the Shanghai-Ningbo ferries of Sifen Company were suspended once.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Went to Qing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Departing on the Fengtian Maru</p>
<p>Wang Kemin, chief advisor to the North China Political Affairs Commission, has repeatedly delayed his trip due to connections with the banking community in Shanghai. Now that Huang Fu, who was staying in Moganshan, has gone down the mountain to Jiangxi, Wang Kemin departed from the Shanghai Bund at 9:00 AM yesterday on the Fengtian Maru for Qingdao to meet with Song Ziwen, lingered briefly, and returned directly to Beiping.</p>
<p>Hu Shize et al.</p>
<h3>Set Sail Overseas Together Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Hu Returns to Switzerland to Take Up His Post; Zhao Attends International Road Conference</p>
<p>Hu Shize, the Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, bid farewell to Wang as Foreign Minister in Beijing the day before yesterday and returned to Shanghai. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he, along with Zhao Zukang, the Chinese representative to the 7th International Road Conference, and Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, set sail overseas together from Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde.</p>
<h3>Kong and His Wife Fly to Jiangxi This Morning</h3>
<p>Stop Briefly in Beijing; Huang Fu May Travel with Them</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has decided to fly to Jiangxi from Shanghai this morning around 9:00 AM, accompanied by his wife, Madame Song Ailing, and his daughter, Lingyi, on the Ford plane specially sent by Chairman Jiang to welcome Kong. After arriving in Jiangxi, in addition to attending a speech at the military officer training corps, Kong must also meet with President Wang, Chairman Jiang, and others to discuss political affairs. In other news, when Kong flies to Jiangxi via Beijing this morning on the Ford plane, he will stop briefly, because Huang Fu, the chairman of the Political Affairs Reorganization Committee stationed in Beijing, arrived in Beijing yesterday from Hangzhou and is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi on the same plane today.</p>
<p>Various Banks Submit to the Executive Yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Request to Amend the Savings Bank Law</h3>
<p>Three Should Be Deleted, Two Should Be Amended</p>
<p>Rapid Enactment of Implementing Rules Can Provide Remedy</p>
<p>After the promulgation and implementation of the Savings Bank Law, the Banking Association invited all Chinese commercial banks in the city to hold a tea party to discuss and decide to request amendments. A reporter from New Voice obtained the Association's notice and submission from a certain bank last night, which are detailed below:</p>
<h3>Association Notice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association notified various banks on the 8th of this month: We hereby inform you that on the 6th of this month, our Association invited all Chinese commercial banks in the city to hold a tea party to discuss the Savings Bank Law and the issue of requesting amendments. It was decided that the banks not in the Association should submit separate requests for amendments based on our Association's original draft submitted to the Ministry. The procedures for drafting and issuing them have been entrusted to our Association. We have printed and distributed the draft submission, along with the Savings Bank Law. Please review and study it. If you agree, please reply within two days so that we can draft it and send it to the banks for stamping and issuance as soon as possible. Please handle it urgently.</p>
<h3>Presentation to the Ministry and Departments</h3>
<p>Various banks petition the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, requesting amendments to the Savings Bank Law, stating that the Savings Bank Law should be carefully reviewed and amended to effectively protect depositors and facilitate its implementation. We believe that the essence of savings lies in accumulating small amounts to cultivate the habit of national savings and accumulate national capital. The division of bank deposits into fixed and current accounts is purely to meet the needs of depositors and their choices. The size of national savings reflects the overall economic strength of a country, and the ebb and flow of fixed and current deposits are inevitably subject to the magnitude of national savings. If various industries are developed, the national economy is prosperous, unemployment is not a concern, and life is stable, then savings will be greater, and depositors will naturally be happy to deposit into fixed-term deposits with higher interest rates. Conversely, if savings are very weak, any surplus funds are often prepared for temporary emergencies, and it is practically impossible to expect them to deposit more into fixed-term accounts. Therefore, depositors' choices of fixed or current accounts are entirely dictated by their savings capacity, and they themselves dare not act rashly. The government should not force them to choose, and banks have no way to accept or reject. According to Article 5 of this law, current deposits shall not exceed four-tenths of the total deposits. The legislative intent is to encourage the collection of more fixed deposits so that funds can be fully utilized, and market changes will not trigger a wave of withdrawals. The intention is profound, but banks and depositors will face great difficulties. As far as banks are concerned, the receipt and payment of deposits by banks vary from day to day, and it is impossible to match the proportions at all times. For those who have established branches in other cities, the total number cannot be calculated at that time, and there is no standard to follow. The bank is overwhelmed and exhausted to comply even for one day. As far as depositors are concerned, deposits were originally a matter of personal freedom. Now, with this regulation, depositors who deposit current accounts are likely to be rejected by the bank or have part of their deposits returned. Or even if they go to various banks, they may ultimately be unable to deposit due to the ratio limitation. Under such circumstances, it is enough to reduce the public interest in national savings and prevent the accumulation of national capital. The impact is significant. Depositors often deposit into current accounts first, and then convert to fixed accounts after accumulating a certain amount. In other words, current savings are the beginning of fixed savings. If restrictions are added, it is tantamount to cutting off the source. We should request that this restriction be deleted. Furthermore, national legislation should be long-lasting, so the meaning of the articles should be broad and not involve excessive details, and it should not be based on the special circumstances of one time and place as a standard. Article 8 of this law stipulates the composition restrictions on the use of funds. The legislative intent is to prevent the orientation of property and avoid crises, or to support rural areas to save the current evils. The legislative intent is recognized by everyone, but the trend of the times cannot be reversed. The prosperity and decline of economic undertakings and the supply and demand of investment matters also change with time. Especially since the amount of savings deposits received by various banks varies, it is difficult to adhere to one standard. Article 7 of this law has already limited its use, and all the paths of savings deposits within the scope of the restrictions do not need to be determined again to determine the investment policy based on time and place, so as to be flexible and profitable. Moreover, savings banks bear a greater responsibility than ordinary banks. For the sake of their own interests, practitioners will also do their best to ensure safety. After careful consideration, the provisions of Article 8 are not only too restrictive, but also may become ineffective after a long time. We should request that it be deleted. Furthermore, Article 7 of this law stipulates various items for the use of funds. The fourth item is to release funds pledged by fixed-term deposit certificates or passbooks of other banks. Although banks have the custom of accepting pledges of fixed-term deposit certificates of their own banks, it is not a prescribed business, so it can be handled flexibly. Now this law states that it can accept pledges of deposit certificates of other banks, then the scope is even wider. If there is a financial emergency, the law has already been stipulated, and there will inevitably be strong requests to accept pledges. It is extremely easy to cause misunderstandings and affect the market when banks are difficult to accept or reject. According to the banking habits of the United Kingdom and Japan, mortgages are also prohibited. This section is not very important and seems to be handled by banks in accordance with customs, which is more active. We should request that it be deleted. Furthermore, rural lending is a crucial plan in the entire national economy. However, for savings banks, in terms of ensuring the safety of depositors' funds, there are still points that should be noted. Most of the savings banks and commercial banks concurrently operating savings are now concentrated in cities. They are not familiar with rural lending, and they have more isolation from local conditions. Once they are forced to do it, there will be the worry of losing one thing or the other, or the worry of being unable to reach it. This is one. Our country's rural areas are disorganized, and the establishment of cooperatives in various places is not universal. Even in areas where cooperatives have been established, there are many cooperatives with substantial content, but also many with no substance and incomplete organizations. It is conceivable how dangerous it would be for savings banks that are not skilled in rural lending to engage in rural lending in a disorganized rural area. This is two. Agricultural funds focus on long-term low interest rates, but Article 8 of this law stipulates that loans pledged by rural cooperatives and loans pledged by agricultural products shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. In other words, one-fifth of the deposits of savings banks have become fixed long-term loans. If the market changes, rural loans are not easy to recover, and the bank's fixed-term deposit certificates or passbooks cannot be refused for mortgage according to law. The impact is not only enough to shake the business of savings banks, but also loses the legislative purpose of protecting depositors. This is three. With these three points, the council will think again and again, and all agree that saving rural areas is an overall national policy. It should be planned by the state as a whole, and it should not be solely assigned to savings banks. The national rural economy and the conditions in various places are different. How should we consider the situation and take care of everything? Only the state can have this power. This power should be held by the state bank, and commercial banks and savings banks should follow suit. In this way, depositors' protection and rural relief will both benefit. This should be amended. Furthermore, savings banks are determined to be joint-stock limited companies, which is clearly stated in this law. Article 15 stipulates that directors and supervisors shall bear joint and several unlimited liability. It is assumed that the legislative authorities intend to stabilize depositors' protection and promote the self-respect of directors and supervisors. The intention is extremely profound. However, directors and supervisors are shareholders who perform business, and the greater the authority, the greater the responsibility. Before the enactment of this law, all banks automatically increased the responsibility of directors and supervisors, because there is a relationship between authority and responsibility. Now this law so restricts the savings business that it is strict and meticulous. Article 7 has listed the use of funds, and Article 8 stipulates the composition of its use. Directors and supervisors have no power to flexibly allocate. If they do not handle it in accordance with this law on weekdays, it is their fault if the bank suffers misfortune. Otherwise, if an accident occurs due to compliance with the law, they will still be liable for joint and several unlimited liability, which is not fair. The association admires the state's emphasis on savings and safeguarding the public interest, and has no intention of evading responsibility, but cannot bear the responsibility beyond compliance with the law. We should request that it be amended. Furthermore, domestic savings banks and banks that also handle savings have a considerable history. Foreign banks that also handle savings in China have never had restrictions. Each bank has its own special circumstances, which are extremely inconsistent. Once this law is implemented, there will be many problems. Moreover, are foreign banks that also handle savings subject to this law? If it cannot be universally applied, then domestic banks will not be able to develop due to excessive restrictions, or they will not be able to accept deposits as much as possible due to legal components. Chinese people's savings will inevitably be deposited in foreign banks, which is not the legislative policy. In addition, there are many clauses in this law that need to be explained and supplemented. In the era of metabolism and Sino-foreign mixes, implementing detailed rules should be formulated to remedy the situation and relax the implementation date to adjust. These points are all very important for long-term legislation. It is advisable to consider all aspects to eliminate obstacles and promote unhindered implementation. In this way, the savings business can be expected to grow, and depositors and banks will benefit from it. The association is concerned with its own interests, admires the government's purpose of promoting savings, and handles its own business seriously. It dares to express its opinions frankly and humbly requests the Ministry and departments to examine and approve it, and promptly re-examine and amend it, and wait for instructions. It is for the public good. Sincerely presented.</p>

<p>Aftermath of the Rickshaw Dispute</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Petitioned the Public Works Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Because the Newly Fixed Rental Fare Exceeded the Original Price</p>
<p>The Result of Petitioning the Vehicle Committee with Six Demands Was Satisfactory</p>
<p>A Few Rickshaw Pullers Caused Disturbances and Were Arrested and Released</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the rickshaw problem in the Public Concession has been resolved through mutual agreement. Rickshaw owners have begun to obtain licenses. Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, more than 200 rickshaw pullers objected to the newly stipulated rental fare of 85 cents in silver dollars, which exceeded the original 11 cents in small dollars. They also objected to the rickshaw owners joining the mutual aid association and other matters. They specifically petitioned the Vehicle Committee of the Public Works Bureau, requesting the implementation of rickshaw puller registration and the early establishment of the mutual aid association, among other six demands. The details of the situation learned by the Xinxin News Agency reporter are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Motivation for the Petition</h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers believe that the new method of resolving the issue through negotiation between the rickshaw owners and the Vehicle Committee has changed the original rental fare of 11 cents in small dollars to 85 cents in silver dollars. Based on the current prices, this is equivalent to 11 cents in small dollars plus 16 copper coins, which exceeds the original price and increases the burden on the rickshaw pullers. In addition, the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association allows two representatives from the rickshaw owners to participate, which is inconsistent with the original purpose of the mutual aid association. At the same time, there are no clear provisions regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers and other issues, which has aroused resentment among the rickshaw pullers. Therefore, they specifically petitioned the Vehicle Committee, requesting a clear response.</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Response</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 7 o'clock, more than 200 rickshaw pullers gathered in the Changsha Road and Xiaoshadu Road area to hold a temporary meeting. They resolved to make six demands for the purpose of the petition, and elected He Linsheng, Zhu Fengxiang, Cang Gongwen, Xu Xinglin, etc. to lead them directly to the Vehicle Committee of the Public Works Bureau to petition. Many rickshaw pullers from the Haotu rickshaw company also voluntarily joined. A member of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee met with them. The representatives made six requests, and the Vehicle Committee responded to each of them one by one. (1) Request that Mr. Massey, the chairman of the Vehicle Committee, not resign, and the rickshaw pullers unanimously retain him. (Answer) The rumor that Mr. Massey resigned is a misunderstanding. (2) Please continue to follow the original method, with a rental fare of 10 cents in small dollars per day, plus a mutual aid donation of 1 cent in small dollars. (Answer) Because the exchange rate between silver dollars and small dollars is unstable, the rental fare is stipulated in silver dollars. The current rental fare of 78 cents in silver dollars is equivalent to 10 cents in small dollars based on the average exchange rate in the first half of this year. (3) Oppose rickshaw owners joining the mutual aid association, because this association is funded by the rickshaw pullers themselves, and the rickshaw owners do not contribute any money. (Answer) Rickshaw owners do not join the mutual aid association's fund management committee. As for the two rickshaw owner representatives joining the association's board of directors, it is to express their intention to cooperate. In the future, they will be elected by the licensed rickshaw owners. Once the rickshaw puller registration is completed, the rickshaw pullers will elect two representatives to join the board of directors to jointly plan the process. (4) Mr. Cheng Xiechun is not a rickshaw puller and should not be a representative of the rickshaw pullers. (Answer) Mr. Cheng Xiechun's participation is based on his relationship as a fellow Jianghuai native, and he is not acting as a representative of the rickshaw pullers. (5) Rickshaw pullers should be registered immediately, four per rickshaw. (Answer) Rickshaw puller registration will begin soon and will still register four people per rickshaw according to the original plan. (6) Please have the Vehicle Committee preside over the establishment of a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association as soon as possible. (Answer) The rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association will be established soon. The rickshaw pullers expressed satisfaction with the committee's responses and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Minor Disturbances</h3>
<p>After the rickshaw pullers' appeal group petitioned the Public Works Bureau, a group of rickshaw pullers divided into teams, holding small flags and slogans, and ordered other rickshaw pullers to stop in various places such as Jiaxing Road, Kangdi Road, Disiwei Road, Kader Road, and Wuzhen Road Bridge, and deflated the rubber tires. Therefore, a large number of rickshaw pullers were unable to operate for a while, and the situation was quite chaotic. When the Rickshaw Owners Association received the news, they believed that this kind of action not only affected the business of the rickshaw owners but also concerned the livelihood of the rickshaw pullers. They immediately reported it to the Public Works Bureau. Chief Patrolman McTyeire ordered each police station to stop it and arrest them. More than 20 people were arrested by the Xinzha Road police station, more than 10 people by the Jiaxing Road police station, and a small number of people were arrested by other police stations. It was not until 4 pm that it was calm. It is reported that all those arrested have been released. The rickshaw owners sent people to various places to repair the vehicles and continue their business.</p>
<h3>Remarks by the Vehicle Committee</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Xinxin News Agency reporter went to the Vehicle Committee to inquire about the new rickshaw owners. Committee member Wang Zhiren met with him and said that because the rickshaw owners had not come to obtain licenses in accordance with the new regulations previously issued by the committee, they had recruited new rickshaw owners to apply for registration. However, the committee had stated that when the vehicle licenses were exhausted, the guarantee money (5 yuan per vehicle) paid by the new rickshaw owners would be refunded in full. Now that the old rickshaw owners have complied with the amended new regulations and paid taxes and obtained licenses, there is no room to accommodate the newly registered rickshaw owners. Therefore, the committee issued a notice a few days ago. After the reporter finished speaking, he asked about the results of the rickshaw pullers' petition to the authorities this morning (that is, yesterday morning). Mr. Wang replied that the previous report that Mr. Massey, the chairman of the committee, had expressed negativity and would resign was absolutely incorrect. The rickshaw owners had voluntarily complied with the new regulations, and the only change was the rickshaw rental fare. However, there was little difference between the small dollar fluctuations and 85 cents in silver dollars. This point was purely a rumor. Because the general rickshaw pullers believed that Chairman Massey, who has always loved and protected the rickshaw pullers, would resign suddenly, the rickshaw pullers would feel more distressed. Therefore, they came to the committee to petition, requesting to cancel his resignation intention. Committee member Zhu Maocheng met with them and explained them one by one.</p>
<h3>Statement by the Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a person in charge of the Rickshaw Owners Association told a Xinxin News Agency reporter that at the meeting between the rickshaw owner representatives and the person in charge of the Public Works Bureau the day before yesterday, the rickshaw owners took into account the overall situation and avoided the escalation of the situation. They reluctantly accepted the various measures. The reduction of the rickshaw rental fare and the payment of mutual aid relief funds by the rickshaw owners all expressed the sincerity of the rickshaw owners in taking into account the overall situation and providing relief to the rickshaw pullers. The board of directors of the Public Works Bureau has already ratified it. Regrettably, this morning, so-called rickshaw puller representatives, such as Zheng Moumou, petitioned to oppose the resolutions of the Public Works Bureau and the rickshaw owner representatives, and shouted slogans supporting Massey. It is regrettable that these people claim to be representatives, but they are not rickshaw pullers themselves. It is difficult to understand where they obtained their representative status. The Rickshaw Affairs Management Committee summoned new rickshaw owners to register because it was afraid that the old rickshaw owners would refuse to obtain licenses. It also notified each registrant to comply with the regulations and pay the mutual aid fee and guarantee money. If they did not obtain a license, the guarantee money paid would be returned. This was purely a hypothetical preparation. Recently, it has been discovered that the number of vehicles specified in the notice is being sold at a price on the market to deceive the ignorant. Their speculation and cunning can be imagined. Now that the Public Works Bureau's announcement states that the old rickshaw owners are complying with the regulations and obtaining licenses, the registration of new rickshaw owners will be invalid. Therefore, speculation has failed, and they are posing as rickshaw pullers to engage in disturbances. The rickshaws and rickshaw pullers who were forced to accompany them along the way are still unaware of the truth and meaning under their threats. In several places, it was discovered that rubber tires were being violently deflated and rickshaw pullers were prohibited from operating. Endangering business and disrupting public order is extremely illegal. If this continues, it will affect social stability. The association, in addition to separately submitting requests to the police authorities for a serious investigation and thorough investigation in accordance with the law, has been informed that Chief Patrolman McTyeire has ordered each police station to arrest the ringleaders and detain them for strict punishment. He has also notified each rickshaw owner to inform the rickshaw pullers in the city of the truth of this incident so that they will not be used by them.</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing and Wang Zhengting</p>
<h3>Arrive in Shanghai Today from Qingdao</h3>
<p>Stay Briefly and Then Go to Beijing to Visit Wang</p>
<p>Then Go to Jiangxi to Visit Jiang and Return to Shanghai to Go to Russia</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing, the ambassador of our country to Russia, went to Qingdao to escape the heat of Shanghai some time ago. A Xinxin News Agency reporter learned from diplomatic circles in this city yesterday that Mr. Yan, together with former Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Zhengting, left Qingdao for Shanghai yesterday morning on the China Merchants Bureau's Puan wheel. The wheel is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2 pm today and will berth at the China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzhan Wharf. It is reported that after Mr. Yan arrives in Shanghai, he will stay briefly and then go to Beijing to visit President Wang, and then go to Jiangxi to visit Jiang, and then return to Shanghai to prepare to go to Russia to resume his post.</p>
<p>City Federation</p>
<h3>Sent Three Important Letters to the Public Works Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Request to Improve Educational Administration in the Public Concession</p>
<p>Do Not Overestimate Property Donations or Increase Hotel Industry Donations</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to request the Public Works Bureau to improve educational administration in the Public Concession and cancel the overestimation of property donations and the increase in hotel industry donation amounts, specifically sent letters to the administrative authorities of the Public Works Bureau yesterday. The original letters are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Letter 1</h3>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The educational expenses in the concession are wasted to hundreds of thousands every year. The Chinese citizens fulfill the obligation of paying taxes, but the right to enjoy education is very small. Considering the reasons, although the Public Concession Public Works Bureau's school management office is established, it does not actually examine the educational situation. It should be reformed or schools should be opened. It follows unbreakable rules. For example, school health inspectors hire Westerners, using Westerners who do not understand the situation of Chinese schools and have no research on school health to fill the post. It is really inappropriate. As for management, it also lacks the experience of managing Chinese education. Therefore, to improve education in the concession, it must be supervised by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau in administration, and a special committee should be formed to be responsible for designing to improve the educational facilities in the concession. We hope that your bureau will take measures as soon as possible and proceed accordingly. It would be the education's fortune and the citizens' fortune.</p>
<h3>Letter 2</h3>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We have received a letter from the 10th district branch of this association stating that Jin Chang Factory, a member at No. 499 Zhoujiazui Road, claims that the factory building has been built for many years and its rent is estimated by the Public Works Bureau to be 50 yuan per month. The municipal general donation is calculated according to 50 yuan (that is, 7 yuan per month). Unexpectedly, the Public Works Bureau suddenly accounted for as high as 150 yuan per month, which is twice as much as the original amount, which is really unbearable. It requires negotiations and still pays donations according to the original amount. Based on this, it has been investigated and confirmed that this is the truth. This random valuation is really wrong. It is important to know that the exercise of municipal powers should first be unified. If you play around arbitrarily, turn right and wrong upside down, it will disrupt the municipal administration more than this. We should write to your bureau to investigate and correct it according to reason, and do not overestimate it arbitrarily to maintain the municipal administration. We sincerely hope.</p>
<h3>Letter 3</h3>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We have received a letter from the Shanghai Hotel Industry Association stating that according to reports from members such as Dongfang Dachunghua, the Public Works Bureau sent personnel to investigate room prices and re-accounted for the total value of the house. Starting in October, it will increase to one-third and one-half. In this time of market depression, how can we bear it? Our association, for the survival of the hotel industry, and for the prevention of other industries, will definitely adhere to it consistently. We sincerely ask your association to uphold justice, help with all your strength, and transfer to the Public Works Bureau to negotiate, withdraw its order, and maintain the dying hotel industry. We are looking forward to it. After the sixth executive committee meeting, it was decided to write to the Public Works Bureau to maintain business difficulties and withdraw the agreed-upon opinion. We should write to ask for your consideration.</p>
<p>Municipal Administration</p>
<h3>The Municipal Bond Supervision Committee Will Be Established Today</h3>
<p>Cai Zengji Will Be the Chairman of the Committee</p>
<p>After the 3.5 million yuan Shanghai Municipal Public Value issued in the Republic of China in 23 years, it was underwritten by the British firm New Fortune Bank, and the public subscription was sold out immediately. The New Fortune Bank has already transferred the money to be delivered to the Municipal Finance Bureau through the Bank of China. Various buildings have begun to be built. As for the members of the Supervisory Use Committee, they have been completely presumed. Chairman Cai Zengji, Director of the Finance Bureau, Committee Members Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau, Li Fuxun, Chairman of the National Debt Fund Management Committee (temporarily replaced by Secretary-General Lin Kanghou), Bei Songsun, Shanghai Banking Industry Association, representatives of the Municipal Council and New Fortune Bank have also been presumed. The first meeting will be held at the Municipal Finance Bureau at 10 am today to announce its establishment.</p>
<h3>The Lawyers Association Petitions the Ministry of Justice</h3>
<p>Lawsuits Should Be Sold at Cost</p>
<p>Interest Should Be Given on the Money Paid</p>
<p>More than ten lawyers from the Shanghai Lawyers Association, Xu Zuoliang, Zha Renwei, Zhao Zuwei, Ge Zhitan, Wang Xiaowen, Wu Guangding, Xu Zuyan, Gu Yuanchang, Zuo Deshou, Shen Xuyuan, Wu Baotai, Zheng Wentong, etc., proposed suggestions for two issues: lawsuits in the court should be sold at cost, and interest should be settled on the money paid by the parties involved. They asked the association to forward them to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and order the national courts to unify the selling price, etc. The association has promoted members to review and believe that it is necessary to forward them to the Ministry of Law. Yesterday, a document has been drafted and forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The original text is recorded as follows: For forwarding matters, according to members Xu Zuoliang, Zha Renwei, etc., the lawsuits issued by our country's courts are priced differently in each province. For example, civil lawsuits in Jiangsu Province sell for 90 cents, and criminal lawsuits sell for 45 cents. In Zhejiang, civil lawsuits sell for 60 cents, and criminal lawsuits sell for 30 cents. This really makes the people bear unfair burdens.</p>
<h3>Wheat and Cotton Gradually Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>American wheat loans, according to the contract, were to be fully loaded in the United States by the end of June and arrive in Shanghai by the end of August. However, due to the strike, ships carrying wheat were stranded in Portland and could not depart, causing the wheat ordered by various factories in Shanghai to be delayed. Now that the strike has ended, American wheat is being loaded in large quantities for Shanghai. Yesterday, this port received a telegram stating that 9,700 tons could arrive in Shanghai on the 12th of this month. Workers are being prepared for unloading. Three more ships, carrying over 20,000 tons, have also set sail from the United States and are expected to arrive and be delivered in Shanghai by the end of this month at the latest, with all shipments completed within ten days.</p>
<p>In addition to wheat, there is still a large amount of flour, totaling over 200,000 tons, included in the American loan. Initially, the shipment was delayed because there was no way to sell this flour in Shanghai. However, now that North China is in urgent need of wheat flour and factories in Shanghai are unable to keep up with production, the batch of over 200,000 tons of loan flour has also begun to be loaded onto ships in the United States and is expected to arrive in large quantities early next month. It is said that the Economic Commission will allocate a portion to be transferred to the Northwest for the purpose of subsidizing the development of the Northwest.</p>
<p>Two batches of American cotton, totaling over 39,000 bales, have already arrived and been fully unloaded at the Chinese warehouses. The third batch has already been loaded and is en route. It was originally scheduled to arrive on the 15th, but due to slight delays en route for the "Adigan Sea" (carrying 15,500 bales) and the "Aysania United" (carrying 1,740 bales), the arrival date has been changed to the 22nd of this month. There are also two more ocean liners, the fifth and sixth batches, carrying a total of over 19,000 pieces of cotton. According to a telegram yesterday, they are expected to arrive in Shanghai around September 15th and will be unloaded at the Chinese warehouses. In addition, 19,500 bales of cotton directly purchased by Japanese merchants in Shanghai from the United States are also expected to arrive on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Inconsistencies are especially evident everywhere in our country's government orders. Even with the sanctity of the judiciary, simple lawsuit matters cannot be standardized. Moreover, the cost of lawsuit paper is estimated to be only about four or five cents. The court is not a profit-making enterprise and should not sell lawsuit paper that costs four or five cents for ninety cents or sixty cents in one place, and forty-five cents or thirty cents in another. Even if judicial funding is insufficient, the government should find ways to allocate funds. If it is absolutely necessary to collect from the people, it should be clearly stipulated in laws and regulations and formally collected. It does not seem appropriate to use pretenses to raise the price of lawsuit paper, which is an act close to the monopoly of goods and arbitrary price increases, leaving a stain on the judicial organs. This is the first matter that should be corrected. Furthermore, the Shanghai courts, the First Special District Local Court, have only recently started calculating interest on the funds deposited by the parties involved (but the use of the interest collected in the past has not been disclosed). Other courts, such as the Second Special District Local Court and the Local Court, have not yet calculated interest on the funds deposited by the parties involved. This is not only the case in Shanghai but is likely true for judicial courts across the country. Ancient sages said, "Rectify oneself and then rectify things." The court's responsibility is to protect the rights of the people based on the law. Rectifying oneself and rectifying things is what it should do. The court itself should not have or obtain undue benefits. This is the second matter that should be corrected. The above two cases are matters that the court itself should correct. We, who cherish the judiciary, have dared not remain silent as far as our limited knowledge extends. We plan to ask the assembly to discuss and suggest that the Judicial Administration Department issue a notice to the whole country to find ways to correct these matters in order to maintain judicial authority. Based on this, the 174th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the association resolved to make recommendations to the Ministry for adoption and implementation. It is appropriate to submit a document to the Ministry for review and implementation, which would be of public benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Judicial Administration Department by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association.</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Responds to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Private Transportation of Copper Coins and Inferior Small Coins</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office yesterday responded to the Ministry of Finance, stating (omitted above): The customs office has always been extremely strict in inspecting the private transportation of silver coins and copper coins. We have repeatedly received your orders, which have been forwarded to customs officials to handle with diligence. Now that we have received orders to strictly investigate and prohibit, we have forwarded them to the Tax Affairs Department for compliance. According to their response, the customs office has followed the government's clear orders and established measures to strictly investigate and prevent this matter. The recent decrease in the number of smuggling cases detected does not mean that the prohibition order has not been strictly enforced, but rather that the customs' strict prevention has deterred smugglers from passing through the customs' jurisdiction. However, since the previous instructions have been forwarded, in addition to reiterating to customs officials that any copper coins and inferior silver coins transported without permission should be detained, we also request your review, etc. All reasons for the customs office's crackdown on the private transportation of copper coins and silver coins have been forwarded to the customs for compliance. We respectfully submit this document for your inspection.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Highway</p>
<h3>The Entire New Long-Distance Telephone Line is Completed</h3>
<p>Currently Continuing to Lay Local Lines in Various Districts</p>
<p>Direct Dialing Throughout the Line is Not Far Off</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone line was originally set up along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, with a total of three pairs of lines. However, due to the heavy traffic during peacetime, it was insufficient for use. In order to facilitate the flow of information between Beijing and Shanghai, the Ministry of Communications specially allocated funds to lay several pairs of long-distance telephone lines along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway. Since the commencement of construction this spring, most of the project has been completed. The route passes through Nanjing, Liyang, Yixing, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, and reaches Shanghai. According to the Long-Distance Telephone Office, as of the middle of last month, three pairs of long-distance telephone lines on this highway have been installed. The remaining three pairs of lines were also fully installed last Sunday. Currently, telephone sets are being installed and the installation of local lines connecting Changshu, Wuxi, and other places is continuing in order to enable communication between districts first and then determine the date for direct dialing throughout the line. In the future, telephone communication between Beijing and Shanghai will no longer be subject to interruptions and congestion, and will be much more convenient than before.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Shanghai Seafarers' Branch</p>
<h3>Wu Huan Discusses Guiding Principles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union has been ordered to reorganize and has been rushing to complete the handover procedures in recent days, which is extremely busy. Yesterday, Wu Huan, the chairman of the branch, made the following statement: "This time, Director Yang of the General Union has revised the organizational rules of the local branches to improve work efficiency and has also appointed me (Wu himself) as the chairman of the Shanghai branch. I am shouldering heavy responsibilities and fear that I am not up to the task. I am also deeply grateful for the welcome telegrams from various seafarer groups. Our country's shipping industry is backward. In order to develop it, it is necessary to rely on the country's overall political and economic situation, and it is also necessary to have a sound seafarer organization and improve their living conditions. The Shanghai branch is located in the center of culture, transportation, commerce, and economy, where rivers and seas converge and seafarers gather, so its responsibilities are particularly important and its affairs are particularly busy. As international relations become increasingly complex, the responsibilities it bears are even greater. I am humbly entrusted with this mission and can only follow the central policy and the intentions of the General Union and Director Yang, follow in the footsteps of my colleagues, work hard, thoroughly reorganize, overcome difficulties, and strive to establish a sound formal union as soon as possible to fulfill the mission entrusted to us and comfort the seafarers' expectations. As for the current work procedures, we should distinguish between the urgent and the less urgent, and we must actively handle registration and complete the basic work. Shanghai seafarers have a superior level of knowledge and are well aware of the absolute necessity of cooperation between seafarers themselves and the union. I believe that this basic registration work will be completed soon."</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Convenes Various Groups</p>
<h3>To Discuss Methods for Dredging the Wusong River</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the dredging of the Wusong River is related to the water conservancy of Shanghai, Baoshan, Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiading, Daguan, and Qingpu counties, providing irrigation for over 8 million acres of farmland. Unfortunately, due to prolonged neglect, the river channel has become increasingly silted up. Local gentry have attempted to find ways to dredge it, but ultimately gave up due to lack of funds. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided on a dredging plan. The Municipal Government believes that the Wusong River is related to a significant amount of farmland and intends to resolve the issue as soon as possible in order to proceed simultaneously. We have learned that Mayor Wu is scheduled to convene representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shipping Association, and the directors of the Finance, Public Works, and Engineering Bureaus, as well as relevant personnel from the Municipal Government, at the Municipal Government at 10:00 am today to discuss dredging methods in order to start construction.</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau's Transportation Committee</p>
<h3>Discusses Pedestrian Safety Measures</h3>
<p>Most Injured Pedestrians are Illiterate</p>
<p>Nine out of Ten are Crossing Roads</p>
<p>During a recent meeting, the Public Works Bureau's Transportation Committee thoroughly discussed two methods proposed by a director to increase the protection of pedestrians on the streets within the concession: (1) The dangers of crossing or lingering on the streets should be widely publicized in important locations. (2) A safe zone should be designated for pedestrians crossing the streets, similar to other well-known cities. According to the police chief's report, most pedestrians injured in accidents on the streets are illiterate, so the usefulness of danger notices is questionable. Pedestrian accidents often occur at street intersections because they attempt to cross the road quickly in front of fast-moving vehicles. The current method is for lecturers to give speeches to the public on the method of "seeking safety first when walking." Most major road intersections have pedestrian lanes marked with yellow paint, but few people use them. As for building safety islands, the streets within the concession are generally narrow, and major thoroughfares such as Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road have tram tracks, leaving no room for the installation of such islands. Later, a committee member inquired with the police chief, who replied that accidents involving pedestrians on the streets occur in locations where crossing the road is not allowed, accounting for approximately nine out of ten cases. Another committee member said that since there is no detailed investigation into all the important causes of pedestrian accidents on the streets, the police chief's report is the only answer to the suggestions made in this case. The city of Bodu in the United States once tried to order pedestrians to cross the street only at designated locations or to follow the instructions of traffic controllers, but it was ineffective because the public did not cooperate with this method. The traffic problem in Shanghai is one of the most difficult in the world. Partial measures cannot be adopted without thoroughly studying the entire problem of traffic management from all aspects. All accidents on the streets of American cities have detailed records of classification and listing in order to determine the causes of the accidents. It is believed that the police departments of American cities will be happy to share the methods used to classify and analyze accidents on the streets, and the news about these methods will be of great benefit to the study of traffic management problems in this port. After discussion, the committee believed that the police chief's report was a sufficient answer to the methods proposed by a director. However, the problem of pedestrian traffic is becoming increasingly important and should continue to be noted by the police chief at all times.</p>

<p>During the Typhoon the Other Day</p>
<h3>Many Boats Capsized at the Mouth of the Wusong River</h3>
<p>Four Pig Boats Sunk</p>
<p>The Jiangbei pig boat Ni Changtai loaded 160 live pigs from the Ni Shengji pig business in Xinsheng Port on the 7th of this month, intending to sell them in Shanghai. At 11:00 am on the 8th, when it sailed to the coast opposite the Lion Forest outside the Wusong River mouth, it encountered a typhoon. It was unable to withstand the direct hit and was capsized by huge waves. The live pigs were also lost with the boat. Six crew members and six pig merchants (a total of twelve people) fell into the water with the boat. Fortunately, the Chongming ship Jingde passed by and immediately threw two lifebuoys, rescuing crew member Chen Wenfu and pig merchant Yao Dareen, who were able to survive. They were sent ashore in Wusong on that ship. The two immediately reported the details of the accident to the Shanghai Municipal Pig Industry Wusong Delivery Office and requested rescue. Director Hong Wenjiang of the office inquired about the situation and first sent the injured pig merchant Yao Dareen to Yuanshun Pig Business for treatment at the hospital. He then tried to find the whereabouts of the ten missing crew members, including the helmsman Liu Lujin. Until yesterday morning, six crew members and pig merchants, including Liu Lujin, arrived in Wusong and claimed that they had been hit by a typhoon and washed up on the beach by huge waves. They were rescued by the British merchant ship Ruihe of Jardine Matheson and taken to the ship. Loan Dispute with the Bank of Communications</p>
<h3>Fu Xiaoan Sues Lawyer Yan Dajue</h3>
<p>Lawyer Yan Sends a Letter to Fu on Behalf of Dai Zhenwu</p>
<p>Fu Believes it Has Intimidating Intent and Sues in Court</p>
<p>丨Lawyer Yan also Files a Counterclaim Against Fu丨</p>
<p>Fu Xiaoan, a well-known figure from Ningbo, served as the manager of the Bank of Communications in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Later, due to political reasons, he was wanted by the National Government. Therefore, his vacant position as manager of the Bank of Communications was succeeded by Wang Xinguan. Wang's relative, Dai Zhenwu, also known as Shengzu, the owner of the Japanese-owned Dai Shengchang Shipping Company, borrowed over 110,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications on behalf of Fu. Dai signed a promissory note and gave it to Wang for safekeeping. Last year, after Wang Xinguan died of illness, Fu was also able to cancel the wanted order, so he returned to his original position. Fu then proposed this promissory note at a board meeting of the bank, wanting to sue Dai for the previous loan. Although the directors</p>
<h3>Did Not Approve</h3>
<p>Fu insisted strongly and sued the Japanese consulate, claiming that Dai was a Japanese merchant. Dai then hired the Japanese lawyer Yano Nobuo to negotiate the lawsuit with Fu, but because Yano had not registered with the Chinese court, he commissioned the Cantonese lawyer Yan Dajue as his sub-agent, sending a letter to Fu Xiaoan outlining the process and setting a deadline for a response, otherwise he would file a lawsuit. The letter was sent on June 25th. After Fu received the letter, he believed that Lawyer Yan should not collude to intimidate him and immediately commissioned Lawyer Dai Chengxiang to send a letter to Yan. Yan then instructed Dai Zhenwu to produce</p>
<h3>Relevant Evidence</h3>
<p>Dai immediately handed over a photo of a letter from Wang Xinguan, stating that the staff of the Bank of Communications and the Ningbo people in Shanghai all knew about the matter of raising funds on behalf of Fu. Fu then extended Lawyer Dai to file a lawsuit with the criminal court of the First Special Court, accusing Yan Dajue of intimidation. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 pm, Judge Liu Yugui held a hearing in the eighth criminal court. Yan extended Lawyer Sheng Peidong to turn himself in and presented a defense and a counterclaim in court. Plaintiff Fu Xiaoan did not arrive and Lawyer Dai stated the main points of the prosecution, saying that the "board of directors Fu strongly advocated suing for the loan" in Yan's letter, and "compensating for the damage to reputation and money, limited to a clear response within five days, otherwise a private prosecution" were</p>
<h3>Intimidating Intent</h3>
<p>requesting that it be handled according to law. Defendant Yan Dajue also detailed the process, saying that Dai Zhenwu originally entrusted the case of suing Fu Xiaoan to the Japanese lawyer Yano Nobuo in Shanghai. Yano had not been registered and could not appear in the Chinese court, so he transferred the case to the defense lawyer as a sub-agent. After accepting this sub-agency case, the defense lawyer gradually inquired about the facts and intended to file a lawsuit on his behalf. However, he heard that Fu Xiaoan was a person of considerable status, so he first sent a letter based on the facts, asking him to respond clearly within a time limit, in order to clarify the right and wrong of the two parties, or perhaps someone could mediate and settle the dispute. After the draft of the letter was prepared, it was still given to Yano to read and obtain his consent, believing that it was not contrary to the meaning of the entrusted matter. After his</p>
<h3>Approval and Stamping</h3>
<p>it was returned to the defense lawyer, who then made a copy and sent it out. Later, he met directly with Dai Zhenwu and conducted an investigation based on the facts stated by Yano. The so-called "a letter from the three gentlemen to me," Dai Zhenwu showed a photo of the letter, and the defense lawyer believed it to be true and handed over the photo to be attached to the dossier as evidence of the facts of the prosecution. After the letter was sent by the defense lawyer, he received a reply from Lawyer Dai Chengxiang on behalf of Fu Xiaoan within a few days, saying that it was a fabrication of intimidation and that Lawyer Yan was an accomplice and would be dealt with separately, etc. The defense lawyer then went to inquire about Yano with the letter, and Yano also presented a duplicate of his preparation document submitted to the Shanghai Japanese Consulate</p>
<h3>Civil Defense</h3>
<p>to prove that it was indeed the case and not a fabrication. At that time, Dai Zhenwu said that there was talk of an out-of-court settlement and instructed the defense lawyer to postpone the lawsuit, so the indictment paper that had already been signed is still shelved at the defense lawyer's office. Judging from this period of accepting the case, it is sufficient to prove that the defense lawyer handled it with caution, and it can be known that there was absolutely no fabrication of facts by the party involved. How can the plaintiff falsely accuse the defense lawyer of being an accomplice in intimidation? Based on the above defense, the defense lawyer absolutely had no suspicion of fabricating facts and colluding in intimidation with the party involved Dai Zhenwu, but the plaintiff actually resented and implicated the defense lawyer for acting as an agent in the lawsuit, falsely accusing him of being</p>
<h3>An Accomplice in Intimidation</h3>
<p>and filing a private prosecution with your court, intending to have the defense lawyer subjected to criminal punishment. He should be requested to be punished for the crime of false accusation in accordance with Article 180, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and to attach a civil lawsuit requesting a judgment ordering compensation for damage to reputation. Based on the above statements, it should be announced that the defense lawyer is innocent and that the defendant in the counterclaim is guilty of false accusation, and that he should be ordered to compensate for damage to reputation. Judge Liu verified the confession, and since the defendant in this case had already filed a counterclaim, the defendant in the counterclaim should also be brought to court in accordance with the law. He then instructed that the case be rescheduled for August 17th in the afternoon and that the plaintiff Fu Xiaoan be brought to court for questioning. The court was adjourned and it was already dusk.</p>
<p>to Shanghai. The Western shipowner also gave each of the three seriously injured people 40 yuan (a total of 120 yuan). They landed ashore and took a car to Songjiang. The other four are currently missing and are feared to have drowned and been buried in the belly of the fish. It is said that many boats capsized in the typhoon outside the mouth of the Wusong River the other day. According to what was found out yesterday, there were four stone boats of the Daxing Company, which purchased stones for the Jiangnan Seawall of the Jiangsu Construction Department, and two sand and mud boats from Ningbo that were blown over by the wind. There was also the Niuzhuang sand boat Xin Yushou, loaded with 800 baskets of soybean oil and soybeans, which was blown by the wind and waves and stranded on the beach in Xiaota place outside the mouth of the Songjiang River. Fortunately, it did not capsize. Yesterday, a small tugboat was hired to tow it out of danger. It is feared that there may be more ships that have been lost.</p>
<p>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibits Adulteration of Tea Leaves</h3>
<p>Adulteration of tea leaves is strictly prohibited. According to a recent report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Pingyang, Zhejiang is a famous tea-producing area. The Tea Industry Association of the county has conducted serious inspections to eliminate fake tea. Unscrupulous merchants know that they cannot succeed and have designed roundabout routes to transport exports from Shacheng, Ruian, and other places. If strict inspections are not carried out, the impact on the tea products of the association will be significant. After receiving the report, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, in addition to paying special attention to inspections, also sent a letter to the Ruian County Government requesting that it issue a strict prohibition on the bad habit of adulteration.</p>
<p>Fake Business Name</p>
<h3>Defrauds Out-of-Town Customers</h3>
<p>Victims from Various Places Report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals that the Trademark Number Belongs to Lei Yushang</p>
<p>The house at No. 73 Tongchang Lane, Haining Road, Public Concession, Shanghai, is rented by Li Xingchun, a Cantonese chef at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Simalu Road. On February 10th of this year, two men with accents from Jiading and Nanxiang suddenly appeared, claiming to be Zhang and Zhao, requesting to sublet the house. Li happened to be out, and Li's wife received them. She saw that the two men behaved generously and were neatly dressed, quite like upper-class people, so she did not doubt them and agreed to sublet the house, saying that it was for the purpose of opening a business name as a wholesale point, with a factory in Nanyang. After the rent was paid, no lease contract was signed. They moved in immediately, set up their business, and placed advertisements in various newspapers, falsely claiming that they had registered with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry in 1928 and obtained a license number 103, and a certificate number 37 issued by the Capital National Goods Exhibition Hall for participating in the Jiangsu Specialty Exhibition, in order to celebrate their 12th anniversary, promote domestic cotton textiles, and send out sample notices. At the same time, they distributed 500 gift vouchers in various provinces and cities across the country, stating that for every 8.50 yuan sent abroad, they would send 62 kinds of sample goods, along with a price list of the above domestic goods samples. They also claimed that after receiving the payment, they would send a shipping notice in two boxes by the post office customs broker, using red-cornered printed stationery and envelopes. The price list was also very gorgeous. As a result, many people from provinces, cities, counties, towns, and villages sent letters to purchase the goods. It is said that the amount of money obtained by fraud was very large, which is quite shocking. Until April 10th, the two men, who claimed to be Zhang and Zhao, disappeared without a trace and sealed the back door key in a letter, leaving it on the window of the house for the second landlord to open, falsely claiming that they had been ordered to close down and had already wound up, and that all the belongings existed to pay the rent. It was stated that there were no names. After Li Xingchun opened and disassembled it, he realized that he had been deceived. Later, after the payment was made, letters came from various places urging them to send the 62 kinds of sample goods, but they had already fled without a trace. It is said that those who were defrauded included the county magistrate of Qian'an, Hebei, the Nanggong County Government, the Laibin County Government, Li Zongwu of the Third Section, the Anyou County Public Security Bureau, the Jishan County Public Security Bureau of Shanxi Province, and the director of the Xinbi County Public Security Bureau of Hubei Province, and so on. They have sent written complaints to the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, accusing the factory of setting up a scam to obtain money, and the cases are piling up like mountains, along with the deceptive statements sent by the factory, falsely claiming that "Our factory recently suffered a fire in the neighborhood, which caused a lot of damage to the machines and goods. If you can't wait, please let us know and we can return the money." The printing and letters are quite amusing. After Director Wen received this large number of written complaints, in addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Government to investigate whether the factory had registered with the Ministry of Industry, he also ordered Hong Qi, the chief of the Second Section of the Bureau, to send Wang Guoxian, the director of the Commercial Affairs Division, to investigate the results. According to reporters, the Municipal Government has investigated with the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and other departments that the license number 103 and the certificate number 37 issued by the Capital National Goods Exhibition Hall for the Jiangsu Specialty Exhibition are the licenses of the Lei Yushang Songfen Tang Medicinal Materials Company. Therefore, after Director Wen received the order, he has issued a wanted order to his subordinates to arrest the fleeing scammers and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Death by Stealing Watermelons</p>
<p>Qu Atao Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Qu Atao, a 30-year-old man from Huangdu, used to be a fruit vendor, but recently became unemployed. This summer, he partnered with a friend to transport watermelons for sale. This time, he hired Wang Jiangyin's lighter to load more than 100 dan of watermelons from the Fangtai area of Huangdu. Qu Atao was in charge of the boat. At about 2:00 pm the day before yesterday, it sailed to the west end of the Xinqiao bridge at the Sampan Factory. There were more than a dozen ruffians from other places who were swimming in the river. When they saw Qu's watermelon boat, they rushed forward to block it and demand watermelons. Qu saw that there were many of them and did not dare to refuse, so he had to reluctantly give them four watermelons. Unexpectedly, they claimed that they had to have twenty. Qu refused to agree, and the ruffians became angry. They dragged Qu Atao into the river and forcibly dragged Wang Jiangyin. Wang saw that the situation was bad and grabbed the side of the boat. Fortunately, he did not fall into the water, but after Qu Atao was dragged into the water, he drowned because he did not know how to swim. Later, the ruffians saw that they had caused a great disaster and fled in all directions. Wang Jiangyin was shocked and cried for help. With the help of others, he took Qu Atao's body to report to the Water Patrol Squad to arrest the fleeing criminals and notified Qu Ajin, the father of the deceased in Huangdu, and Qu Wang, the wife of the deceased, who came to Shanghai overnight to mourn the body. Yesterday morning, Lu Abao, the local security guard of the 11th district, reported to the local court. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang, along with examiner Xuan Zhiming, went to investigate.</p>
<h3>Legal Case Regarding Hemorrhoid Removal</h3>
<p>Hemorrhoid Tube Inside Glass Bottle</p>
<p>It Was Merely a Doctor's Deliberate Mystification</p>
<p>Ge Heqing Was Fooled, He Rongzhou Is Despicable</p>
<p>Ge Heqing, a clerk from the Zhongfu Bank on Hong Kong Road and a native of Ningbo, is 42 years old and resides at No. 2 Zhenru Lane, Kaizier Road in the French Concession. Ge had been suffering from hemorrhoids for a while and had been unable to find a good doctor to treat them. On the 12th of last month, introduced by a friend Xin Youjin, he sought treatment from He Rongzhou, a Jiangbei quack doctor residing at No. 58 Taihe Lane, Buer Road. At that time, both parties agreed on a medical fee of 42 silver dollars, with 6 dollars paid upfront and the remaining balance to be paid upon successful treatment. They also agreed to perform surgery on the 14th. When the date arrived, Ge went to He's place as agreed. He pretended to perform surgery, instructing Ge to lie on the bed and then performed an incision, cutting off the tube of the external hemorrhoid from the anus. He then placed this tube in a small glass medicine bottle and showed it to Ge, claiming that this was the root of the disease and that now that it had been removed, his suffering would be eliminated from then on, and he would recover in a few days. Ge was overjoyed and believed it to be true, thinking that after the hemorrhoid tube was removed, he would no longer suffer. However, he then became suspicious as to why he felt no pain despite having undergone surgery. Nevertheless, he paid the remaining 36 dollars of the medical fee in full. He took the hemorrhoid tube in the bottle home. Unexpectedly, after several days, Ge's hemorrhoids relapsed, and he still felt unbearable pain in his anus. He then realized that the root of the disease had not been removed. Therefore, he sent the hemorrhoid tube cut off by Dr. He to the famous doctor Zhang Xinghai for examination. After examination, Dr. Zhang found that the item in the bottle was not an external hemorrhoid tube but resembled a grass root. At this point, Ge realized he had been deceived and reported it to the French police, requesting an investigation. The police chief approved and dispatched detective Gong Wenlang to arrest He Rongzhou and bring him to the police station. The police chief asked him if he had a doctor's diploma or a license from the French Municipal Council. He replied that he did not. The police chief said that since He had neither a doctor's certificate nor a Municipal Council license, he was clearly a quack doctor endangering the public, which was no small matter, and was guilty of fraud under Article 363 of the criminal law, as well as violating Ordinance No. 205 for doctors practicing medicine issued by the French Consulate and Ordinance No. 115 for shops issued by the French Consul. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated him. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi explained the case, followed by a statement from the plaintiff Ge Heqing, who stated that he was currently being mediated by friends and requested the case to be withdrawn. The judge instructed that this case was not one that could be withdrawn at will. Ge then gave a detailed account of how he sought medical treatment and was deceived. When asked, He Rongzhou confessed that when the plaintiff came to him for treatment, a lot of pus and blood flowed from his anus, which healed after he performed surgery and applied medicine. As for the contents of the bottle, it was actually a pus and blood tube from the anus. Now that the plaintiff did not want to pay, he could return the money in full, etc. Judge Wu reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to pay a deposit of 300 yuan to be released on bail, pending a further hearing on the 13th. He also ordered the contents of the bottle to be sent to the forensic doctor for examination to determine whether it was actually a tube or something else.</p>
<h3>Bi Furui Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Both Sides Hope for Reconciliation</p>
<p>Adjourned for Another Week</p>
<p>Bi Furui, the accounting director of the Beipiao Coal Mining Company's Shanghai warehouse, was arrested for stealing the property of his aunt Xu Bi (i.e., Xu Wutaitai of Shengze) worth over 100,000 yuan stored in the vault of the Zhongnan Bank. The case was investigated by the police, who arrested Bi and his father, brother, and Wang Fusheng, and transferred them to the First Special District Court. Because there was hope for reconciliation, everyone except Bi Furui was released on bail. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant's lawyers Fan Gang and Yuan Yang'an stated the status of the reconciliation, saying that after the adjournment, with the mediation of relatives and friends from both sides, Bi Furui had gradually repaid the money with his salary, and the Bi family's land was offset against the plaintiff's losses. The only unresolved issue was that the plaintiff needed to pay a sum of cash upfront. It was initially agreed to pay 5,000 yuan upfront, but Bi Furui needed to go out and arrange for the funds, so they requested the court to allow Bi Furui to be released on bail. However, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that he did not know the details of the reconciliation. According to the plaintiff's statement to his lawyer, he only wanted the case to be concluded as soon as possible, so he requested that the trial proceed. Judge Zhan then ruled to proceed with the trial. As the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu was about to explain the case, lawyers Fan and Yuan immediately said that the reconciliation of the case was already in sight, and requested the court to consider that both sides were relatives. Once the trial began, it would inevitably fail. They requested the court to revoke the ruling to help them complete the reconciliation. Judge Zhan approved, revoked the judgment, and adjourned the case for one week. Bi Furui was allowed to be released on bail with a deposit of 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Comes to Shanghai to Sue Widowed Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>Son Died Nine Years Ago, Sued Once Before</p>
<p>Recently Filed Criminal Charges Against Daughter-in-Law for Obstructing the Corpse</p>
<p>Qian Hua, an elderly woman from Wuxi, is 70 years old. Her son, Qian Yuzhang, used to make a living in Shanghai. More than ten years ago, Yuzhang and Qian Yan (i.e., Qian Huang), a woman from the same hometown, became acquainted and lived together in a rented house, their affection deep and seemingly like husband and wife. However, because they had no children, they adopted a son named Guanqin (nickname Zhigen), who is now fourteen years old. However, in 1926, Yuzhang suddenly fell ill and died. Yan immediately purchased a coffin, had him encoffined, and transported the coffin back to her native Wuxi for burial near Meiyuan in the old Huliliwan area. However, this was discovered by Yuzhang's mother, Qian Hua, who, suspecting that her son's cause of death was unclear, feared</p>
<p>French Concession Municipal Federation</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing on Opposition to Water and Electricity Price Increases</h3>
<p>Municipal Federation Fourth Branch Sends Letter to Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>Fifth Branch Schedules Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the French commercial water and electricity company in the French Concession of this port recently changed the regulations for the supply of water and electricity, increasing the old security deposit (i.e., cabinet deposit) and meter installation fees several times. Starting from July of this year, all users should wait for the new agreement to be implemented. After receiving the notice from the company, all stores in the French Concession were panicked, feeling that in this economic downturn, they could not afford this disguised price increase with huge deposits. They unanimously expressed their opposition and jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Federation, advocating fairness and negotiating on the basis of reason. The Fourth Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Municipal Federation sent a separate letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession and the Second Municipal Federation, requesting negotiations on the basis of reason. The Fifth Branch also announced the convening of a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The original letters and announcements of the two associations are transcribed below.</p>
<h3>Letter to Taxpayers' Association</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>We have learned that the French commercial water and electricity company recently secretly requested the French Municipal Council to change the regulations, increase the meter installation fee, and the huge cabinet deposit. At a time when the market is depressed, all industries are declining, and the livelihoods of the citizens are in danger, the French Municipal Council did not consider it and was secretly requested. According to the council's bulletin, the company's request stated that it was giving up the price increase request made in 1932 and instead implemented a huge increase in the cabinet deposit. This action is no different from a disguised price increase. Water and electricity are public utilities, and their main purpose is to facilitate the citizens, unlike other profit-making businesses. Moreover, the company earns more than one million yuan a year and is still not satisfied, being greedy and insatiable, only seeking profit, disregarding the current situation of commercial fatigue, and the economic distress of the citizens. Arbitrarily disguised price increases are unreasonable. Our association has received repeated requests from citizens in the district to oppose and prevent this disguised price increase in order to alleviate the burden. After convening an emergency meeting for discussion, it was unanimously agreed that under the current economic downturn, with general overproduction and falling prices, public utilities should reduce their prices to save the situation. Now, the purpose is to increase prices, which the citizens cannot afford. It was unanimously decided to write to your association, requesting you to forward the letters to the Chinese directors, and suggest to the French Municipal Council to quickly stop the company from changing the regulations to avoid disguised price increases and secure the citizens and alleviate their burden. Therefore, we are sending this letter to your association for your prompt handling.</p>
<h3>Fifth Branch Announcement</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>Our association has received statements from members such as the Zhonghua Factory on Caishi Road, stating that they have received a notice from the French commercial water and electricity company that the water and electricity deposit will be increased from July. We were shocked to read it. Merchants are having difficulty maintaining their businesses in this time of economic recession, how can they afford this huge cabinet deposit? They request reasonable negotiations and strong opposition. Our association has scheduled an emergency meeting to be held at the association office at the intersection of Laoshifu Road at 3:00 pm on the 12th of this month to discuss countermeasures. We hope you will attend on time and not delay.</p>
<p>That it Might Be Ensnared by Yan, She Rushed from Her Village to Shanghai and Went Straight to the Shanghai Local Court, Accusing Qian Yan of Murdering Her Son. The Local Court Approved the Case and Took It Under Cognizance and Tried to Transport the Coffin of Yuzhang Back to Shanghai. The Prosecutor Opened the Coffin for Inspection. As a Result, Because Yuzhang Had No Wounds, The Local Court Repeatedly Opened Trials and Interrogated The Accused but with No Evidence, The Case Was Difficult to Establish. Qian Yan Was Found Not Guilty and Acquitted. The Case Judgment Has Been Given for Several Years. Recently, Qian Hua Hired a Lawyer to Submit a Complaint to the Criminal Court of the First Special District, Accusing Her Daughter-in-Law Qian Yan and Grandson Qian Guanqin of Obstructing a Corpse. The Court Approved the Case and Issued an Order to Summon Them to the Weiqingchi Bathhouse at No. 925 Haining Road. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, Judge Liu Yugui Presided over the Trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. The Defendant Qian Guanqin Was Not Present Due to His Young Age. Only Qian Yan Was Present in Court. The Plaintiff Qian Hua Said: "I am 70 Years Old, A Native of Wuxi, and Now Live with Relatives at No. 21 Lafayite Road. The Defendant Is My Daughter-In-Law, Guanqin Is My Grandson. My Son Yuzhang Had an Affair with Qian Yan, But Unfortunately Died in 1926. However, When Yuzhang Was Dying, He Left Behind Assets of 60,000-70,000 Yuan, and the Defendant Did Not Care About Anything, Left the Coffin in Xijin Association, Leaving It Exposed and Unmanaged. For Eight Years Now, She Has Not Tried to Transport the Coffin Back, Purchase Land for Burial, and Also Does Not Provide for My Living. She Abandoned Me in the Countryside, so I Came to Sue." When Interrogated, Qian Yan Confessed: "I Am 58 Years Old. Qian Yuzhang Was My Lover and Lived with Me for About Twelve Years. Later, Yuzhang Died Eight Years Ago. I Purchased a Coffin and Had Him Encoffined, and Transported the Coffin to Xi for Burial. The Plaintiff Suddenly Sued Me in the Shanghai Local Court for Murdering Her Son. The Court Opened the Coffin for Inspection and There Is a Judgment Document to Present as Evidence. Now, I Heard that Yuzhang's Coffin Is Temporarily Stored in Xijin Association, But Last Time I Already Transported Him to Xi for Burial, so Now I Have No Money to Handle It Again. Guanqin Is My Adopted Son, Because He Is Only Fourteen Years Old, So He Was Not Present Today." Judge Liu Reviewed the Confession and Ordered the Case to Be Adjourned to the Afternoon of the 17th, Ordered Qian Guanqin to Be Present in Court for Further Interrogation, and Also Ordered Both Sides to Try to Reconcile Out of Court.</p>

<h3>Male Corpse Floating in Puzhong Canal</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM the night before last, an unidentified male corpse floated northward with the tide from the Pumi Canal in Yangshupu, to the area where the Customs Water Patrol Police Station was stationed. The corpse was spotted by a member of the police station, who hauled it up. The corpse was wearing a torn white twill short shirt, blue cloth pants, straight Gongni shoes with a floral pattern, no socks, and had a shaved head with a floral white hair band. It was estimated to be about 40 years old. Upon closer inspection, there were seven knife wounds on the head, with several of them deeply penetrating the skull.

<h3>Jealousy and Adultery Lead to Corrosive Liquid Attack</h3>
<p>Ding A'si Suffers Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Ding A'si, a 24-year-old Yangzhou native residing at No. 123, Lane 171, Wangzhi Road in the French Concession, works as a shop assistant at a Westerner's house and lives comfortably. Yao Wenmei, a young woman from Huiyang of about the same age, possesses a bit of beauty and a romantic nature. She also works as an amah at the same Westerner's house. Soon, the two became involved in adultery, and their relationship was unusually close. However, due to the lack of confidentiality, Sha Ziming, Wenmei's former lover, found out and was consumed by jealousy, plotting revenge. Yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, Ding and Yao Wenmei were passing near the Xiejiao General Assembly Hall on Jing'an Temple Road when they were suddenly ambushed by Sha Ziming, who was lying in wait by the roadside. When he saw the two approaching, Sha rushed up and splashed a bottle of corrosive liquid on Ding's head. At that time, Ding A'si was caught off guard, and his head and face were covered in corrosive liquid. Immediately, his skin was torn and flesh was rotten, a terrible sight to behold. The perpetrator, seeing that his goal had been achieved, quickly ran away without a trace. Wenmei, seeing the great disaster, also fled westward.

<p>Rent Reduction Association Sends Letter to Lawyers</p>
<h3>Cases Rejecting Rent</h3>
<p>Separate Letters to Sun Xinyuan and Yiyuan Company</p>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee of this city yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association, requesting it to inform its members to refuse to accept rent disputes. The original letter stated: "To Whom It May Concern, we have recently received a letter from the Xicheng Lane Tenants Association of the French Concession, stating that the houses in which they live, a total of 134 households, have been rented for more than ten years. They have been managed by Yipin Bank and have rental contracts and agreements. Unexpectedly, this year, Yilian Company has taken over the management. When the company took over the management, it stated to the tenants that it was a change in name only and that there would be no other changes. Unexpectedly, within three months, the company ordered them to sign a new contract. Because the tenants found the contents of the new contract to be quite harsh, they dared not accept it and requested modifications. Unexpectedly, the company hired lawyer Wu Zhenming to sue them for refusing to sign the contract in the First Special District Court. After the people clearly defended themselves to the court, they were judged to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. However, the company was still unwilling to give up and filed an appeal. The rent in Xicheng Lane was increased by 10% in 1930. Now, with the economic downturn, it is really unbearable to bear this huge amount of rent. Please grant relief," and so on. Since the "January 28th Incident" until now, all industries in Shanghai have been in decline to the extreme. The reason for this is the high cost of rent. Landlords not only do not consider reducing it, but also exert pressure, causing the citizens to suffer no less than during the "January 28th Incident." In this situation, if we do not find a way to deal with it, how can we maintain the people's livelihood and revive the market? After thinking it over and over, we can only ask your association to inform its members to refuse to accept rent disputes, so that the landlords will have no way to use their skills. In the future, the market will be able to recover, and the people's livelihood will be worry-free. We are grateful for what your association has done. We believe that the gentlemen of your association understand the market situation and will certainly not be happy to follow their lead. Therefore, we are sending this letter according to the situation. Please investigate and handle it."</p>
<p>Regarding the Xicheng Lane rent dispute, a letter was sent to Mr. Sun Xinyuan, stating: "To Whom It May Concern, we have recently received a letter from the Xicheng Lane Tenants Association, stating that the houses in Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, Malang Road, French Concession, a total of 134 households, are all the property of Mr. Sun Chuanfang, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Five Provinces Allied Forces. They have been rented for more than ten years. They have been managed by Yipin Bank and have rental contracts and agreements. Unexpectedly, this year, Yiyuan Company has taken over the management. During the change, Yiyuan Company sent a letter stating that it was a change in name only and that there would be no other changes. Unexpectedly, within three months, the company ordered them to sign a new contract. Because the tenants found the contents of the new contract to be quite harsh, they could not accept it and requested modifications. Unexpectedly, the company sued them for refusing to sign the contract in the court. After the people clearly defended themselves to the court, they were judged to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit. However, the company was unwilling to give up and filed an appeal. The rent in Xicheng Lane was increased by 10% in 1930. Now, with the economic downturn, it is really unbearable to bear this huge amount of rent. We are sending this letter to ask for your assistance to maintain the people's livelihood," and so on. Based on this, since recent years, all industries have been in decline, which can be said to have fallen sharply. All moral landlords have successively initiated voluntary rent reductions, which are published in various newspapers every day. I think you have already understood it, and there is no need to repeat it. However, Yiyuan Company, when taking over the management, stated to the tenants of the lane that there would be no changes, so the company should take care of its reputation and fulfill the old agreement. Why is it that a harsh new contract is being ordered to be signed? What is its intention? It is really difficult for people to guess. The properties in Xicheng Lane are all owned by you. Therefore, we are sending this letter according to the situation. It is hoped that you will inform the company to withdraw the lawsuit to avoid disputes, and order them to restore the rent before 1930 to maintain the people's livelihood." (There is another letter to Yiyuan Company, which is roughly the same, omitted.)</p>

<h3>Buys "Song of the Fishermen"</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Waitong News Agency in this port, it is heard that French film novelist Di Daier, who is in Shanghai, was very satisfied after seeing the performance of "Song of the Fishermen" and has invested in buying it and taking it back to France to be performed, promoting Chinese films.</p>
<p>Taikoo Company</p>
<h3>Northern Line Liners Offer Special Treatment to Passengers</h3>
<p>Hiring Armed Guards to Protect the Ship</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Northern Line has three ships, Shuntian, Shengjing, and Tongzhou, which sail between Shanghai, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin. The Shuntian and Shengjing are new ships with fast speeds, so they also stop at Qingdao. It only takes twenty-four or five hours to reach Qingdao from Shanghai. In addition, the ships are well-equipped and the cabins are comfortable, so passengers say it is convenient. After the Shuntian was robbed by pirates in Dagu in June, the company proposed to equip the three Northern Line ships with anti-theft iron gratings for the safety of passengers to prevent unfortunate events from happening again. It is currently requesting instructions from the London headquarters. In the past, the company was very strict with passengers, requiring reliable guarantors. Also, because ticket agencies were not allowed to sell passenger tickets on their behalf, passengers expressed dissatisfaction, which greatly affected business. The company realized the reason and changed its plans, seeking to develop rapidly. For the safety of passengers, it hired many armed guards to protect the ship. All travel agencies and ticket agencies can still sell passenger tickets on their behalf, and the ship's purser's office has also resumed selling tickets to facilitate passengers.</p>

<p>Outline of Measures Enclosed</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association has been very busy recently preparing for the National Child Welfare Conference. It is heard that the association, in order to gather collective wisdom, has sent letters to religious organizations nationwide that are involved in child welfare work, such as the Children's Moral Advancement Society, Infant Health Clinics, Buddhist Orphanages, and Buddhist Child Welfare Homes, inviting them to send representatives to attend the conference for the sake of universality. Letters have already been distributed yesterday, along with an outline of measures, excerpted below: (Conference Dates) October 10th to 13th, 1934; (Location) Shanghai; (Attending Representatives) (1) One or two leaders of child welfare organizations selected by the Civil Affairs Departments of each province and the Social Bureaus of each city; (2) Leaders of charitable organizations in various regions whose work is related to child welfare; (3) Specially invited child education experts and pediatricians from various regions; (Conference Proposals) Any agencies or organizations that send representatives, or individual representatives, or agencies that cannot send representatives but wish to submit proposals, are requested to send them directly to the Chinese Child Welfare Association at No. 131, Museum Road, Shanghai before September 15th of this year; (Representative Expenses) Travel expenses for representatives attending the conference shall be borne by the agencies or organizations or individuals they represent. However, the association can request the Railway and Communications Departments to issue discounted fare certificates, which will be sent out for use before the conference. All expenses within the conference venue will be borne by the association, and accommodation expenses may also be arranged by the association as appropriate; (Soliciting Exhibits) Before attending the conference, representatives from various regions are requested to collect children's achievements, as well as the regulations, reports, photographs, statistics, charts, etc., of local child welfare institutions, and mail them to Shanghai as soon as possible for use in the Child Welfare Exhibition held simultaneously with the conference. For exhibits that are inconvenient to mail, they can be brought to Shanghai when attending the conference.</p>
<p>Riverbeds Dry Up, Manure Boats Suddenly Decrease</p>
<h3>Cleaners in Zhabei in a Panic</h3>
<p>Gathered at the Labor Union Yesterday to Petition</p>
<p>Requesting the Authorities to Find Ways to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The excrement of citizens in Zhabei has always been purchased and transported by farmers from the interior by boat. This year, due to the collapse of the rural economy, the fertilizer business has plummeted. In addition, since the summer, there has been a severe drought, and riverbeds have dried up. The number of manure boats arriving at the port averages only one or two per day, resulting in an abundance of material but a shortage of boats, making transportation impossible. Moreover, the city has no facilities for storing fertilizer. The sudden decrease in manure boats has made the work of cleaners extremely difficult. If they do not work, where will the waste from the millions of households be dumped? If they do work, where can they unload the fertilizer? If they dump it in ditches or the Huangpu River, they will be fined by the police. The cleaners of Zhabei are at a loss as to what to do in the long run. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, a crowd of sixty or seventy people gathered at the Sixth District Cleaners' Union, demanding reasonable negotiations: (1) Requesting the municipal authorities to set up an agency for storing fertilizer so that fertilizer can be stored when there are no boats; (2) Before setting up such an agency, please actively find ways to increase the number of boats; (3) The wages of porters have always fluctuated depending on the number of boats. Now, due to the lack of boats, their income is only three or four yuan per month, making it difficult to make a living. They demand that fixed wages be set according to the original conditions.</p>
<p>The Chicago Exposition Received Yesterday</p>
<h3>A Letter from Ge Zukuang, Consul in Chicago</h3>
<p>Willing to Assist in the Work of the Exposition</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Provincial Government Telegraphed Urgently to Send Waybills</p>
<p>The Chinese Products Association for the Chicago Exposition received a letter from Mr. Ge Zukuang, the Consul General in Chicago, volunteering to assist the association in handling all matters and to win honor for the country. The original letter reads: "In response to your letters of April 9th and 16th, I have taken note of all the details. I was ordered last year to guide and assist in matters related to participating in the Chicago Exposition, which is my duty. It is not worth mentioning my efforts. I am flattered by your praise. I will assist in all participation work here this year. I am responding with this letter for your information. (Omissions below) In addition, the association has recently received exhibits sent from various provinces, including four boxes of green tea from Tianjin Zheng Xingde Tea House, fifty types of soap (fifty dozen in total) from Tianjin Dieyi Company, four containers of ginseng and velvet antler from Guangzhou Tianliangtang Ginseng and Velvet Antler Shop, four bottles of Angelica essence from Guangzhou Beida Ginseng and Velvet Antler Shop, and twelve bags of special agricultural seeds collected by the Fengxian County Government of Jiangsu. The association also received a telegram from the Shaanxi Provincial Government yesterday, urging them to send the waybills so that the exhibits can be shipped to Shanghai as soon as possible. The original telegram reads: (Official title omitted) The Jiang telegram should have arrived. Please send the waybills quickly and reply by telegram. Yang, Shaanxi Exhibit Collection Association, respectfully." According to Zhu Dechao, the director of the association, the seventh batch of exhibits was originally scheduled to be shipped to Chicago on the President Hoover on the 14th. However, as exhibits from various regions continued to arrive, the deadline was extended for a few days to allow for large-scale packing and shipping to the United States to avoid piecemeal loading, which would be uneconomical. Therefore, it is planned to start shipping on the 19th.</p>

<p>Two Roads Bureau</p>
<h3>First Discussion Meeting of the Research Office</h3>
<p>Both Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu Gave Speeches</p>
<p>The staff of the Research Office of the Two Roads Bureau held their first discussion at 10:00 AM on August 8th in the conference room. Except for researcher Wang Qiguang, who was absent due to official business, all other members attended. First, Wang Renshouzhi, the head of the office, reported on the organizational process and invited the director and deputy director to provide instructions on the direction of the work.</p>
<p>Director Huang's Speech: (1) The reason for establishing the Research Office is to solve important, special, or complex problems in the bureau's administration, operations, and technology, in order to increase efficiency and develop the business; (2) The organization of the Research Office involves selecting personnel with knowledge, experience, and a strong research spirit from various departments. They should conduct research on various issues in a practical and humble manner. All researchers are part-time and will not receive additional salary. It is definitely not a sinecure for accommodating personnel; (3) The designated office location is currently temporarily located in the surplus space of the Materials Department. In the future, it is planned to open three rooms near the General Affairs Department and the Machinery Department, with one room as an office and two rooms for relocating the library to facilitate research; (4) Visiting other agencies to study their research work and facilities. The Bank of China in Shanghai, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Jiaotong University all have research offices or institutes. Although their nature is different, we can first visit these places for observation and investigation to learn from them. In the future, we should also go to the South Manchuria Railway Research Institute for inspection within the economically feasible range to collect ideas and broaden our perspectives; (5) Research Standards and Scope: Conduct research in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of the regulations, taking each event as a unit, exploring its historical, factual, legal, or economic relationships, and formulating concrete methods for improvement or resolution. The scope of research does not involve the powers and daily routine matters of various departments, nor does it hinder the duties of researchers in their respective departments; (6) Research Methods: Scientific methods must be adopted, and attention should be paid to the three points of truth, goodness, and beauty.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Wu's Speech: (1) It is hoped that Director Huang will pay special attention to the organization of research work in railways or other agencies in various countries during his overseas inspection, and collect as much material as possible for reference by the bureau's Research Office; (2) It is hoped that the Research Office staff will work hard during the overseas inspection period and make considerable progress. Finally, all researchers and attending staff exchanged opinions and decided that regular weekly discussions would be held every Thursday at 9:00 AM without further notice. Proposals should be submitted by researchers in advance and compiled by the director for the agenda, which will be presented for discussion at the meeting in order to start the research.</p>
<p>Friendship Travel Group</p>
<h3>Holding a Family Summer Cooling Trip</h3>
<p>Night Tour of Minhang on the 11th</p>
<p>The Friendship Travel Group at the corner of Niuzhuang Road and Lloyd Road has already held three summer cooling trips on the Huangpu River. The number of applicants was very crowded, and unfortunately, there were quite a few people who missed out due to limited cabin space. It is heard that in order to promote family travel, the group has chartered the No. 2 Municipal Ferry to "Minhang" at 8:30 PM on the 11th (Saturday) for a second summer cooling trip. The cost is only five cents per person, which is particularly economical in order to popularize it. Hilarious movies will still be shown on the boat. Upon landing, the group's traditional music ensemble will perform silk and bamboo music in the Minhang Flower Garden to add to the fun. Upon returning at midnight, group buses will still be provided as usual, running in four districts (east, west, north, and south) for group members to ride for free. This is truly a unique event in the travel industry. However, the quota is set at 200 people and is about to close.</p>
<p>Anley Trading Company</p>
<h3>Establishing an Automobile Sales Department</h3>
<p>Appointing Mr. Sun Chang as Chinese Manager</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Chang, a senior figure in the automotive industry, has been engaged in the automobile business for more than twenty years. Last year, he returned to Shanghai from the north. The Anley Trading Company, admiring his reputation, hired him as its Shanghai representative. All customers from other cities who come to Shanghai to purchase Universal brand, Xin Ford, and Chevrolet trucks are handled by Mr. Sun. In recent years, the company's business has been growing daily. Now, in order to expand the scope of business, an automobile sales department has been established at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Marlborough Road, and it is planned to appoint Mr. Sun as the Chinese manager. However, Mr. Sun has just been entrusted with an important position by a certain bank, so the decision on whether or not to take the position of Chinese manager is still under consideration. It is believed that the company needs to appoint Mr. Sun to develop its business and will not want to let him go.</p>
<h3>A Peking Opera Theater Will Be Built in Pudong</h3>
<p>Recently, Wang Baodi, Ji Xiaofeng, Tang Zhan'ao, Yu Kuiyuan, Hou Hanqing, Zhou Xianglin, and others have initiated the establishment of the Pudong First Stage in Gaolang Bridge, Huade Road, to perform Peking Opera. They have already invited performers and are decorating and repairing the theater. Once the work is completed, they will choose an auspicious day to open. Although this area is a workers' district, there are not many entertainment venues. In the future, the business will definitely prosper, and the market will also flourish.</p>
<p>Fudan University Student</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Du Nanxi's Murder</h3>
<p>Zhang Asi, a native of Suzhou, along with Xiao Wang, who is at large, ambushed and murdered Du Nanxi, a Fudan University student from Sichuan, in front of No. 47, Puchun Lane, Marlborough Road, in the French Concession, at around 8:00 AM on March 24th of last year. The French police searched for them but were unable to capture them. Later, Zhang and his accomplices, Lu Jiaxiang, Zhu Tianming, and Ma Boli, natives of Ningbo, were arrested for committing robbery in the International Settlement. The First Special Court sentenced Zhang to fifteen years of imprisonment, Lu to twelve years, Zhu to ten years and six months, and Ma to twelve years. The sentences were confirmed and they were sent to prison. Recently, Zhang suddenly discovered his conscience in prison and confessed to the Du murder case. Jin Jiulin, the Inspector-General of the French police, along with detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, and bao detective Cai Jinzhang, learned of this and brought Zhang to the French police station for investigation. They learned that in addition to killing Du Nanxi in the French Concession, Zhang and his three accomplices, Lu, Zhu, and Ma, had also committed robbery. Lu Jiaxiang had also agreed to the murder of Du at the time. Therefore, Lu, Zhu, and Ma were also brought to the case and sent to the Second Special Court to be prosecuted for crimes such as murder and robbery. Chief Judge Wang Gangxu concluded the trial and awaited sentencing. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. Chief Judge Wang presided over the First Criminal Court and sentenced Zhang Asi to fifteen years of imprisonment and fifteen years of deprivation of civil rights for aiding and abetting premeditated murder. The robbery charges were dismissed. Lu Jiaxiang was sentenced to three years and six months for carrying a weapon and gang robbery, reduced from five years for carrying a weapon and gang robbery, to be served for seven years. Zhu Tianming was sentenced to five years for carrying a weapon and gang robbery, reduced from seven years for carrying a weapon and gang robbery, to be served for eight years. Ma Boli was acquitted. After the sentences were announced, the defendants were transferred back to the detention center to await further instructions.</p>
<p>Municipal Federation Sends Letter to Telephone Bureau</p>
<h3>Properly Plan for Communication Between Chinese Concessions</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau yesterday, stating: "We have received numerous requests from member stores and firms. Since the opening of telephone communication between the Chinese concessions, it has been extremely convenient for transportation. However, there are inconveniences when connecting lines. When the concession side connects to the Chinese side, they often say they are busy, so even if you call several times a day, it is still the same. After investigating the reason, it is assumed that there is a shortage of telephone lines on the Chinese side, resulting in poor communication and creating obstacles, which is not conducive to transportation. Therefore, we are writing to request your bureau to promptly devise a proper plan to maintain the transportation business. We pray for this."</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Continued "Errors and Difficulties in Translations" (Ran Xu)</h3>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. Du Luoji丨</p>
<p>Question: "The decline of the capitalist system is not due to the laws within that system, but must be the conscious work of the working class." The last sentence is unclear.</p>
<p>Answer: This translation is slightly different from the original text, which should be translated as: "The decline of the capitalist system is not due to the laws within that system, but must be the conscious work of the meaning of the working class. Hilferding separated the meaning of the working class and their conscious actions from the contradictions of capitalism and class struggle." "The conscious work of the meaning of the working class" means that it is not necessarily caused by social contradictions, but rather something that the working class does according to their own meaning and intention.</p>
<p>Question: "... it has an unchanging divine right to demand a share of the utopian lion," please explain.</p>
<p>Answer: This sentence should be translated as: "It has an unchanging divine right to demand a share of the utopian spoils." The original translation is incorrect. "To demand a share of the utopian lion" should be translated literally as "to demand a share of the utopian lion." "The lion's share" means the food that the lion can snatch. What the lion snatches is of course a lot, so it can also be translated as "spoils." This sentence can be translated more colloquially as "... it has always had a large part of it that is utopian."</p>
<p>Question: The paragraph from page 197, lines 9 to 12, where Marx criticizes Feuerbach, is very unclear.</p>
<p>Answer: This sentence means that Feuerbach can only see the things of each era in each era, but does not understand the developmental relationship between one era and another.</p>
<p>Question: "... not towards filling abstract thinking with the content of political decrees, but towards dispersing the content of existing political decrees and treating it as abstract thinking." Could you explain the two aspects in a more colloquial way? (To be continued)</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On the Employment Problem of Young People</h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>In the midst of the worldwide unemployment panic and economic downturn, the employment of young people naturally becomes a problem. Undoubtedly, the main focus of this problem is not whether young people are willing to work, but rather that there is simply no work available. Therefore, our investigation of this problem can only find its causes from an objective perspective, and not from the young people themselves. However, recently, some people do not regard this problem as a serious social problem, but only see it as a phenomenon caused by the unconsciousness of young people, and blame the young people. For example, Mr. Youmo is one such person.</p>
<p>Mr. You's article "The Employment Problem of Young People," published in "Free Talk" the day before yesterday (August 6th), begins by saying: "Is there a way out for young people? This question seems difficult to answer at first glance. Because from a theoretical point of view, it can involve major issues such as social ills, landlord exploitation, and the collapse of the rural economy. If we expand further, we can extend this to serious topics such as the economic aggression of the great powers, the world's economic downturn, and the decline of the imperialists. But abandoning theory and talking about facts, I feel that the problem of young people's way out is not as serious as mentioned above. Whether they have a way out or not, the key lies entirely in the young people themselves; in other words, it depends entirely on whether they can be conscious." Then, he cited several examples to prove that the reason why young people are unemployed is entirely because they "are unwilling to compromise" and "prefer to turn down opportunities," proving that "they clearly have a road ahead, but they refuse to take it." Finally, he affirmed a conclusion: "Therefore, do young people have a way out? On this question, I dare to prove with facts that they cannot say they have no way out, but they have gone in the wrong direction."</p>
<p>Mr. You's meaning is very clear: as long as young people can be more frugal and not "think about material comfort or high pay," they will not be unemployed no matter what kind of work they do. If we use the examples cited by Mr. You, as long as middle school graduates do not want to be postal workers, compradors in foreign firms, bank managers, or section chiefs and commissioners, and are willing to compromise and become elementary school teachers with a monthly salary of twenty-two yuan or even manual laborers, the number of unemployed people in society will naturally decrease day by day. However, Mr. You has not considered that society does not lack elementary school teachers and manual laborers with monthly salaries of twenty-two yuan or less, and they are also just as crowded and experiencing an unemployment panic. Even if the general student population follows the path pointed out by Mr. You, the result will simply be to squeeze out another group, those who have had fewer opportunities to receive education and have not achieved a higher status, turning those in employment into the unemployed and simply swapping their positions. Can this be considered a way out for young people? Do those young people who have not received middle school or higher education not need a way out? Does their widespread unemployment not become a problem?</p>
<p>The Chinese have always advocated diligence and frugality for building a career, and Mr. You himself is among the general middle school and higher students, so he only came up with such a way out for the youth graduated from middle school or above. This is originally not surprising. We only hope that Mr. You can take a break from the circle surrounded by students and open his eyes to look at things outside of students, to see if the problem of young people's unemployment or whether they have a way out is really "can involve major issues such as social ills, landlord exploitation, and the collapse of the rural economy" and "can also be extended to topics such as the economic aggression of the great powers, the world's economic downturn, and the decline of the imperialists," and not let the young students around him block his own eyes. To take a step back, Mr. You should at least look beyond the little bit of facts he cited as examples and see what kind of significance the recent graduation of students from various universities in Beiping and the rise of the vocational movement represents.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Zibo</h3>
<p>— Luo Wang</p>
<p>(VII) The Blind with Bright Eyes</p>
<p>The fate of miners often leads to "hanging themselves from the southeast branch" [suicide due to poverty and hardship]! However, looking at it from another perspective, there are also material goods workers! Glassblowing workers! Their end often turns them into beggars—the blind with bright eyes!</p>
<p>As reported earlier, besides coal, the next most important product of Boshan is "Boshan Glass" and "Boshan Material Goods."</p>
<p>Indeed, Boshan's glass, glass silk mirrors, and material goods, with their exquisite carvings and bright colors, are enough to outshine Western goods! In the past, Germans who came here to travel would buy Boshan goods and admire them as antiques! A pair of vases often fetched prices of a hundred, fifty, or thirty yuan. Foreigners had plenty of money! Boshan merchants made a lot of foreign wealth!</p>
<p>Many glass and colored glaze products rely on workers blowing them! Therefore, these workers, responding to the demand for goods, worked extra hard, breathing near hot furnaces every day, focusing their eyes only on the objects they were blowing! Over time, after decades, all their time was spent beside the melting furnace, and their eyesight gradually became nearsighted! Eventually, they became white-eyed! They couldn't see clearly unless the object had extremely strong luminosity! Furthermore, their eyes were injured, and in old age, they became the blind with bright eyes! Unable to work, unable to eat, they ended up becoming beggars!</p>
<p>Since the Northeast Incident, the sales of Boshan material goods have decreased! As a result, fewer workers are employed, and the furnaces are not always lit! In this way, it seems that many workers' eyes have been saved! However, another problem has followed: the unemployment and wage reduction of glass workers! This phenomenon, many elderly Boshan people can recount! The vicissitudes of life are truly lamentable!</p>
<h3>New Talk on Old Subjects</h3>
<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>| A Look at Popular Language Literature from a Historical Perspective |</p>
<p>No matter how good your advertisement is, if there are no goods to show people and immediately prove your claims of low price and high quality, then your words are lies and nonsense—this is something everyone can say.</p>
<p>"Bring out the goods!" This one sentence can shut the mouths of those who boast about their goods without substance.</p>
<p>Do you advocate for popular language? Do you support the construction of popular language literature? Then please show us some examples of popular language. This request isn't too excessive. | However, it's a bit like seeing a single chicken egg and treating it as a rooster, hoping it will crow at dawn—somewhat impatient. In reality, the masses are just the masses; they aren't gods who have fallen from the sky. As long as you have ears, you can hear the voice of the masses; as long as you have eyes, you can see the face of the masses. Aren't the people you interact with and deal with every day the masses? You yourself are also a part of the masses, as long as you are considered a person. Saying it this way, popular language is the language of the masses—does that need to be said? Popular language is what the masses can speak, understand, write, and read, and that can also represent the progressive consciousness of the masses. Such language and writing should be called popular language—who would disagree? Classical Chinese doesn't meet this standard, so it's certainly not popular language. Is vernacular Chinese popular language? This needs to be discussed separately.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about ancient vernacular literature:</p>
<p>Existing ancient vernacular literature should be traced back to the *bianwen* of the Tang and Five Dynasties and the *pinghua* of the Song Dynasty. What was the popular language of the Tang and Song Dynasties actually like? We don't really know. Since the *bianwen* and *pinghua* of that time were spoken by storytellers and understood by the masses, we can consider them the popular language of that time without being too wrong.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about poetry. The poems of the Tang Dynasty monks Wang Fanzhi and Hanshanzi used vernacular language and were very popular among the people. A Tang Dynasty manuscript of Wang Fanzhi's poems was discovered thirty years ago in the Dunhuang grottoes. Hanshanzi's poems were inscribed on rocks, and people wrote them on the walls of their halls. They used the language of the masses to write poems, propagating the philosophy of life they had learned from Buddhism. These kinds of poems were able to circulate among the people because they were like maxims, from which one could gain some lessons; if they hadn't been close to the vernacular language of the masses, no one would have paid attention to them, even if the lessons were good. As long as it's close to the vernacular language of the masses and can grasp the psychology of the masses and cater to the tastes of the masses, it can still circulate among the people, even if there are no lessons or even if it's the opposite, and shouldn't be taken as lessons. A little before Wang Fanzhi and Hanshanzi, Yang Junzhi of the Northern Qi Dynasty wrote many six-character poems, which were said to be very lewd and very shallow, and circulated among the people under the name "Yang Wu's Companions." Some people copied and sold these songs, and they were available in every market. Once, Yang Junzhi was passing through a market and saw a written copy of these songs, with mistakes in them. He wanted to correct them for the person selling the copy. The seller said, "Yang Wu is an ancient sage. How could there be mistakes in the companion songs he wrote? What do you know, daring to spout nonsense?" Unfortunately, Yang Wu's Companion songs haven't been passed down, otherwise, we could see what kind of tunes Li Jinhui was making 1,900 years ago. Isn't the reason why Mr. Li Jinhui's songs are so popular everywhere today still due to the two elements of shallowness and lewdness? Although these songs use a language close to that of the masses, their content only caters to the lower tastes of the masses and doesn't represent the progressive thought of the masses, so they are still far from ideal popular language songs. In short, whether it's Yang Wu's Companions or the poems of Wang Fanzhi and Hanshanzi, setting aside the content, they were willing to oppose the literati of the time and insisted on writing in the colloquial language of the masses of that day, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>Speaking of poets who used popular language, we can think of Bai Juyi of the mid-Tang Dynasty. It's said that he would read a poem he wrote to an old woman, and he would only be satisfied if the old woman could understand it. His New Yuefu poems were very sympathetic to the laboring classes of the time, and they fiercely scolded the plundering and tyrannical nature of the aristocratic officials—the ruling class. He set four principles for himself when writing these poems. The first principle was to make them easy for people to understand. The second principle was to make them move and awaken people when they read them. The third principle was to use realistic materials for the subject matter, the current political and social problems, so that people would believe what he said was true when they read them. The fourth principle was to make them easy to turn into songs and set to music. Originally, he thought that poetry must have four fundamental elements: language, emotion, thought, and sound, so he set these four principles for writing poetry. Sure enough, his poems were successful and achieved the greatest effect of poetry during his lifetime. He saw that from Chang'an to Jiangxi, for three or four thousand *li*, his poems were inscribed everywhere, and everyone was reciting his poems. Some people were writing his poems to sell for money or to give as gifts. From cities to villages, from princes and high officials to cowherds and grooms, everyone could hum his poems. It can be imagined how widely his poems circulated! At that time, Yuan Gu and Liu Yuxi were good friends of his, and their poetic styles were similar. Being willing to use ordinary vernacular language to write poems, daring to write poems satirizing the authorities, and being able to imitate the form of folk songs to write poems—these were the characteristics of the Bai Juyi school of poetry at that time. In short, they liked to use the language of the masses and write about the lives of the masses to create poetry, and the masses also liked to read their poems or sing their poems. They can truly be said to be the greatest popular language poets of that era.</p>
<h3>I Come from the East (19)</h3>
<p>— Xingye</p>
<p>Along the roads at night, were piles of idlers with nothing to do, still humming songs like "Drizzling Rain." Shop entrances hung with bizarre and outlandish signs, and under the electric lights, twos and threes of shop assistants leaned against the doorways, aimlessly watching the street; their way of leaning was especially particular: bellies sticking out, necks drooping down, and sometimes their right foot crossed behind their left. When speaking or singing, they moved their chins. Some even shook their heads as they sang. Most of them were small and thin, with long gowns hanging on their bodies, turning their bodies into a reed pipe. All of this, after three years of absence, particularly caught my attention.</p>
<p>The hotel smelled strongly of pungent opium smoke. There were people playing cards in the next room, and someone was arguing in the middle of the night. Shanghai people are truly skilled at arguing, as if insults have been prepared under their tongues, and once their tongues are unleashed, it's like a tap turned on, flowing endlessly. I wanted to interfere with them, but I was afraid of being scolded myself. Looking down at the road from the high building, it was still full of people. They walked very slowly, and their hands swung back and forth like windmills.</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers of three years ago were still bending forward and running fast, and the Indian "Ah San" of three years ago were still stretching and bending their left and right hands. Although North Sichuan Road had changed its appearance, the air of North Sichuan Road was still the same. We ate dinner at New Asia, and the fancy-loving Cantonese brought out an unknown menu; we ate something called "Planting Jade in Lantian" and "Jade Xishi," but we still didn't know what Xishi was made of. We Chinese are truly particular about what we eat, but we don't pay much attention to what happens after we eat it.</p>
<p>Shanghai has been placed before me, and China has been placed before my eyes, and I am about to begin my new adventure. At the center of this world's great upheaval, I can see the dangers, greatness, intensity, illusion, chaos, passion, and cruelty ahead. I silently looked out the window, watching the dim and unclear starlight filling the sky, fantasizing about myself and China in five or ten years. (The End)</p>
<h3>Night Records from the Borderland (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>The door opened, and the old woman's face, still bearing traces of fear, appeared in the dim light of the vegetable oil lamp, with a pitiful expression. The man who had been speaking was nowhere to be seen, and judging from the tone of his voice when he spoke to the old woman, he could only be considered a stranger. Immediately, I thought, what does he do?</p>
<p>The old woman probably thought I was a kind person, so she gently patted her chest and turned her eyes in gratitude to a painted image of Guanyin Bodhisattva on the wall.</p>
<p>I had just sat down and was washing my feet in a wooden basin when a brother from the merchant escort team barged in, wearing a military cap on the back of his head and carrying a foreign gun in his hand. He rudely shouted:</p>
<p>"Old fellow, lend me a bedsheet to use, quick, quick!"</p>
<p>The old woman was so frightened that she couldn't speak and retreated, leaning tightly against the mud wall.</p>
<p>This impolite brother rummaged around the room, grabbing a small plate of buckwheat kernels placed in front of the Guanyin Bodhisattva and stuffing it into his mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, that's offered to the Bodhisattva!"</p>
<p>The old woman cried out in a gasp, raising her old hands like withered vines and scratching her hair wildly.</p>
<p>"Offered to the Bodhisattva? Good, let this living Bodhisattva eat it!"</p>
<p>He ate the buckwheat kernels and joked with the old woman, while his feet kept moving around the room, and his eyes kept darting around the corners of the room.</p>
<p>For some reason, he suddenly started arguing with someone in the inner room. The other person's accent belonged to the man I had heard speaking at the door earlier.</p>
<p>I sat still, just washing my feet, and heard the man speaking inside, seemingly still stomping his feet.</p>
<p>"This old mother only has this one sheet, only this one sheet..."</p>
<p>"Old fellow, do you want to get physical? Good—come on!"</p>
<p>*Slap*—a sharp, crisp sound of a slap echoed, followed by the man's loud wail.</p>
<p>"Hey, you dare hit people randomly? Recognize me! Recognize me! I'm not some country bumpkin!..."</p>
<p>"Oh dear, Heavenly Grandfather, Heavenly Grandfather!"</p>
<p>At the same time, the old woman was also crying out in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>I quickly and carelessly slipped my wet feet into my straw sandals, and before I could tie the straps, I rushed in to see, wanting to do my best to mediate.</p>
<p>At this time, the man had already come out wrestling with the merchant escort team brother. He was not yet forty years old, but his beard was already very long, and even the hair by his ears was preserved as part of his beard. Therefore, his appearance looked even more solemn. If he were wearing a Taoist robe, he would look very much like an old Taoist priest. He shouted as if he were blowing his beard:</p>
<p>"Go see the captain, go see the captain!"</p>

<p>Sports News from the Javanese Overseas Chinese Football Community</p>
<h3>Planning to Invite Domestic Football Teams to Campaign in the South Seas</h3>
<p>The Delegation Will Be Dispatched by the Far Eastern Games</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Batavia, this newspaper) Overseas Chinese love sports, almost as a natural inclination. Throughout the South Seas, wherever there are Overseas Chinese, there are sports associations, and they often hold the leading positions in local sports such as football, tennis, volleyball, basketball, and badminton. Even Westerners who are fond of sports cannot compare with them. The "Zhonghua Qunli Sports Association" organized by the Overseas Chinese in Batavia, the capital of Java, has a large number of talented people and excellent skills. It is not only the best in the Dutch East Indies, but also compares favorably with major ports in China. For example, the nationally renowned football star Li Huitang was formerly a mainstay of the association. In addition to participating in inter-port competitions and international competitions in various parts of the South Seas, Qunli frequently invites famous domestic teams to compete in the South Seas. The most notable examples are the expeditions to Java by the Lehua and Nanhua teams many years ago. At the end of last year, the association once again contacted Mr. Yu Hengzhi, the former leader of Lehua, to discuss reassembling the old team and contacting the elite of the South China football community to campaign in the South Seas. Just as everything was ready and the expedition was about to depart, it was suddenly prevented by other reasons, and the trip did not take place. The Qunli Association was very frustrated to hear this. Recently, in order to implement its objectives, the association has again sent letters to domestic teams, asking them to campaign in the South Seas again. It is said that letters and telegrams are being exchanged, and negotiations are underway with various parties. As for which domestic team will represent the country, it is not yet known. However, according to another source, the Chinese team that won the championship in the Far Eastern Games in which our country participated this time will come to the South Seas. If this can become a reality, it will not only revitalize our motherland's national prestige in the South Seas, but also make the general football fans dance for joy.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is Planning to Build</p>
<h3>An Open-Air Swimming Pool in the Western District</h3>
<p>South of the Singapore Park</p>
<p>Expected to Open in the Summer of Next Year</p>
<p>The Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council prepared a budget this spring to build new dressing rooms next to the Hongkou Park swimming pool. After review by the Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, it was deemed that the area was already extremely crowded, and it would be better to build a new pool than to expand the existing site. Therefore, it was decided that a new pool site should be considered this year, and the Director of the Works Department was requested to prepare a plan. It is now learned that the Director of the Works Department has prepared a drawing for a swimming pool to be built at the southern end of the Singapore Park, and it is planned to start construction at the end of December this year or in January next year. The construction cost is included in the 1935 budget, so that the pool can be opened in the early summer of next year. It is reported that this proposal has been adopted by the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Nanjing Women's Middle School and Elementary School</p>
<h3>To Be Renamed Zhenjiang Experimental Elementary School of Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Entirely Moved to Zhenjiang in Three Years</p>
<p>Enrollment to Cease in Nanjing This Year</p>
<p>Because the Normal Department of Nanjing Women's Middle School will be completely finished with this class, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education decided some time ago to rename the Provincial Nanjing Women's Middle School Experimental Elementary School to the Provincial Zhenjiang Experimental Elementary School, and to move it entirely to Zhenjiang in three years, ordering the school to comply. After receiving the order, the school decided to first establish the lower grades of the elementary school in Zhenjiang after the summer vacation this year, temporarily using the Zhenjiang 53 Library as the school site, while constructing a new school building. The Nanjing school will be renamed the Nanjing Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Experimental Elementary School. For the convenience of completion, the original lower grades of the Nanjing school will be merged into two combined grades, while the remaining middle and upper grades will temporarily maintain their original status, but enrollment will cease, with the aim of gradually completing the relocation to Zhenjiang within three years, in accordance with the Department's order. For the convenience of communication, all official documents and letters will temporarily use the Nanjing Branch as the hub.</p>
<p>World Student Association</p>
<h3>Held a Conversation with International Students Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaoping Reports on Travel Precautions</p>
<p>Student Group Organized, Wang Yukai and Others Appointed as Committee Members</p>
<p>This year's students going abroad are scheduled to depart on the 14th and 21st of this month on the President Hoover and President Jackson liners. The World Chinese Student Association held a conversation with international students yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. to discuss travel precautions and the organization of a student group. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Students Present</h3>
<p>Wu Youliang, Wu Youlin, Wang Kaiyu, Gao Qian, Zhou Shoumin, Wu Zaidong, Huang Wenxi, Peng Qixin, Li Zhennan, Cheng Zongqiao, Qin Kuan, Zhou Qingxiang, Wu Shu, Zhou Shiping, Zhu Lancheng, Wang Jiazeng, Lei Junmin, Sun Shengzeng, Xu Beiming, Hu Minjie, Hao Lüduan, Yang Shangzhuo, Lei Zuowen, Ling Zhaolin, and more than forty others were present. Except for two students going to the UK, the rest are going to the US.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Zhu Shaoping reported, stating roughly that since everyone is going abroad for the first time, they are naturally unfamiliar with travel matters. In recent years, the US has been rejecting Chinese laborers, and the restrictions on Chinese entering the country are very strict. A little carelessness can lead to unexpected suffering. The first thing to pay attention to is health issues, such as eye diseases, etc. The second is luggage and books, as the physical examination and luggage inspection of Chinese entering the country are particularly strict. As for Chinese products, such as tea and silk, it is not advisable to bring too much, as bringing too much will raise suspicion of being a merchant and will also be restricted. The journey from China to the US takes three weeks, so there should be a systematic organization of life on board. In addition to casual conversation, the organization of a student group is also very necessary today, etc.</p>
<h3>Organization of Student Group</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the organization of a student group was discussed. Wang Yukai, Wu Youlin, Yang De'en, Yang Shangzhuo, Qin Jing, Lu Jiqing, and Peng Qixin were appointed as committee members of the President Hoover liner student group, with Wu Youlin as the chairman of the committee. Zhou Qingxiang, Wang Jiazeng, Sun Shengzeng, and Lei Zuoyun were appointed as committee members of the President Jackson liner student group, with Lei Zuoyun as the director of the committee. After the meeting, a photograph was taken and refreshments were served before adjourning. It is said that the students going abroad this time will all be issued letters of introduction by the World Student Association to be given to European and American classmates for hospitality.</p>

<p>Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<h3>Establishes Zhabei Experimental Elementary School</h3>
<p>Commissions Tong Shiquan as Preparatory Member</p>
<p>New School Building Has Been Completed</p>

It is learned that a new school building has been built on Xinmin Road in Zhabei and has been completed, and Tong Shiquan has been commissioned as a preparatory member, and is actively preparing to start enrollment soon.</p>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<h3>Urges Submission of Secondary School Survey Forms</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously forwarded the secondary school survey forms for the 22nd year, as ordered by the Ministry of Education, and limited the schools to fill out and submit the forms within one week of receiving the documents. According to the investigation, some schools were able to fill out and submit the forms on time, but there were also many schools that failed to submit them on time. The Bureau has now issued a document to the schools yesterday, urging them to fill out and submit the forms, as the Ministry's order limits the compilation and reporting of these statistics by the end of August.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Broadcasts Lecture Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhaonan Reports on Important Business</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau broadcasted from 4:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. yesterday at the wireless station of the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road. Zhou Zhaonan, an employee of the Bureau, reported on the important business of the Municipal Education Bureau in July.</p>
<p>Children's Health Camp</p>
<h3>Welcome Public to Visit Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Summer Children's Health Camp has been running for five weeks. Mayor Wu Tiecheng has scheduled to host the public at the camp opposite the Wusong Town Railway Station, in the middle school department of Tongji University (formerly the Central Medical College) today (the 10th) from 3:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., and to hold a parents' meeting, and to perform daily life activities. Everyone is welcome to visit. Many ordinary schools and families have adopted the various aspects of hygiene and the methods of instructing children in the camp. Transportation is very convenient, and it can be reached by car or train in forty minutes. Take the Gaoqiao steamer to Song from the Bund, and you can land in a little over an hour.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Jida Vocational Sports Association Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Su Hongbin, Lin Qiwen, and other representatives of the National Jida Vocational Sports Association who are going to Beijing to petition have departed from Shanghai yesterday with a petition and are heading directly to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to petition. It is reported that the association's petition is divided into three points: (1) Request the Ministry of Education to instruct Principal Shen to earnestly rectify school affairs, carefully select professors, improve the school's status, and not to dismiss the old and employ the new, and exclude students. (3) Regarding the establishment of a student work consulting office, attention should be paid to practical methods, and if necessary, the Beijing Vocational Sports Association should be contacted nearby to proceed uniformly. Furthermore, the association sent representatives to visit the school authorities yesterday, and the response to the three points requested was empty. The association considered it unsatisfactory and decided to send representatives again within a few days to negotiate seriously. If the goal is not achieved, the organization will be expanded. Furthermore, the association sent a letter to all university graduates in Shanghai yesterday, informing them that they should rise up together to save themselves.</p>
<p>Chinese Institute of Engineers Gives</p>
<h3>Methods for Honorary Gold Medal</h3>
<p>Academic organizations in Europe and the United States often have methods for awarding honorary gold medals or medals to people who have made special contributions to construction undertakings, in order to encourage academic experts to concentrate on construction undertakings, either to seek improvement for the country and society, or to create happiness for mankind. The intention is extremely good and beautiful, so the country is becoming richer and stronger, and talents are emerging in large numbers, and all industries are prosperous, not because they are good at rewarding and promoting them. The Chinese Institute of Engineers, in view of this, passed the method of awarding honorary gold medals at the conference last year, which was handed over to the board of directors for execution. Now, on June 24, the 14th board of directors meeting passed seven articles on the method of awarding honorary gold medals. Those who receive honors are not limited to members of the association, in order to be popular, but are limited to engineers of Chinese nationality. The seven articles of the method are listed below: (1) The association may award honorary gold medals to people who have made special contributions to the engineering community in accordance with this method. (2) The honorary gold medals of the association are temporarily set as one type. (3) Those who receive honorary gold medals must be Chinese citizens, but are not limited to members of the association. (4) The standards for special contributions to engineering are as follows: (A) Invention: (1) Those who have new theories in engineering; (2) Those who have mechanical items or manufacturing methods that benefit mankind and national defense; (B) Those who are responsible for presiding over huge projects and solving technical difficulties to achieve success. (5) Any Chinese citizen who meets the standards of Articles 4A and 4B may be proposed in writing by more than ten members of the association and submitted to the association. After approval, the two departments of directors and executors shall hire five experts to form a special committee to review it. (6) If the review result is confirmed by the board of directors to be in compliance with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of this method, the association will award the honorary gold medal at the annual meeting every year. (7) If there are any matters not covered in this method, the board of directors may revise it at any time.</p>

<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Shanghai University Shanghai University has always attached great importance to subsidizing poor students and promoting diligence and self-help. In various departments of the school's office, as well as in the science museum and library, there are students who work diligently and self-help to provide economic assistance. Among the graduates of the past, there are many who have completed their studies relying on this. In the last academic year, the school established a self-help society to expand the number of self-help students and organized a committee, with Dr. Xu Zuohe as the chairman, and Zheng Shicha, Wang Chenghao, and Bi Yisi as members, to preside over all the activities and implement labor education in the promotion of student diligence and self-help. Recently, a house and farmland have been rented in Chunjiang Road near the school outside the school as a self-help society for special experiments. The rent is donated by the Dahua Industrial Company, which is organized by alumni Xu Zhaoxiao, Ni Jiaer, Wang Jingye, and Ma Renquan. Since August of this year, all students in the school's middle and high school departments who are willing to work diligently and self-help, have the determination, and have poor family circumstances, and have been investigated and found to be true, can reportedly apply to join the society, up to the quota.</p>
<p>Lida Academy Lida Academy is one of the famous schools in Shanghai, and it is also the first to advocate and try out production education. Its vocational teachers are mostly knowledgeable and experienced, and are willing to devote themselves to social undertakings, which is especially rare. The school is currently divided into the Jiangwan Department and the Nanxiang Department. The Jiangwan Department is for the junior high school and high school general departments and the farm, and the Nanxiang Department is for the high school rural education department and the junior high school and high school general departments. The purpose of the junior high school and high school general departments is to prepare and train talents for research and specialized academics, so the training is very serious and strict. Many graduates have been admitted to famous national universities over the years, especially Tsinghua University is the highest. The purpose of the high school rural education department is to cultivate talents who specialize in rural undertakings to improve the countryside, which is urgently needed in the call for national rejuvenation. The department is attached with farmers' schools and farmers' clinics, inquiry offices, etc., and does its best to serve the farmers. It will soon raise funds to set up farmers' lending offices and various other great plans. The department has already had two classes of graduates who are well received in the countryside. The farm is now focusing on beekeeping and chicken farming. The purpose is to promote the national bee and chicken industry and provide various guidance to general farmers. The honey, breeding chickens, and various beekeeping and chicken farming equipment produced are of excellent quality, which is currently unique in China. Recently, various improvement plans have been formulated to strive for perfection.</p>

<h3>Record of the Vague Aroma of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After clarifying this point, she then issued many orders, sending the eunuchs to carefully arrange the many antiques and jade artifacts hanging on the walls of the carriage. It seems that she was still not satisfied with our method of display, so she did not hesitate to come up with her own ideas and rearrange them again. After the changes were satisfactory, she looked at it herself and felt that there was nothing to criticize, so she ordered the carriage to start. In addition to these antiques and jade artifacts, she expressed her full satisfaction with all other decorations and arrangements, such as murals, curtains, vases, carpets, etc. Therefore, her spirit was more excited than usual. Although she was almost seventy years old at that time, her face was full of complacent smiles after getting on the carriage. She pointed east and west, and was as happy as a seven- or eight-year-old child who had received a new toy. Among them, the point that made her feel the utmost complacency was that on this special train, the authority of the Empress Dowager was revealed more clearly than elsewhere, and the impact was particularly swift. As long as she hummed in a low voice, the entire train would move forward, backward, or stop. At the same time, this small court of hers could move at will on the land she ruled without any effort. In the eyes of people at that time, it was indeed a very proud thing!</p>
<p>Before I entered the palace, not only had I taken countless trains abroad, but I had also taken several trains in my own country, and I did not feel anything different. Only this trip made me feel extremely nervous from the very beginning, even when preparing. From beginning to end, I was always holding two handfuls of cold sweat, fearing that some unexpected disaster would happen. Because the Empress Dowager had never seen a train, perhaps the various actions of the train would inevitably be displeasing to her. In this way, there would be no peace on the road! What worried me especially was the initial jolt when the train started. This jolt would of course have no impact on others, but it could not be said for the Empress Dowager. (102)</p>
<h3>An Old Tea Drinker's Humor</h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>Drinking *ban cha* (slab tea) is a specialty of us Suzhou people, and so is telling humorous stories. Someone said, "After drinking *ban cha* for three years, even someone who isn't humorous will become so." These two sentences are quite true. The gentlemen who are qualified to drink *ban cha* are generally very good at sitting still. Some hold a cigarette, smoking one after another; others slowly draw on the water pipes that are not seen in Shanghai but are still popular in the inland areas of the spring and autumn period, puffing tube after tube. They wear an unhurried and calm expression, enjoying listening to others talk while not opening their mouths much themselves. When they do speak, their tone always contains a hint of teasing. This kind of tone was called "pure conversation" in the Jin Dynasty and is called "humor" in modern times.</p>
<p>I am a young man who likes movement and not stillness, so naturally, I am not qualified to drink *ban cha*. Occasionally, during a break, I would invite classmates to a tea house for a bowl of tea. We would always joke with each other, never stopping for a moment. The old gentlemen drinking *ban cha* then gave us a nickname, calling us "rush teenagers." I thought of a saying, "A rush cannot be used as a walking stick," and went to ask the old gentleman, "You say we are rush teenagers, are you mocking us for being useless teenagers who cannot support a heavy burden?" The old gentleman flicked a piece of paper and slowly said, "That's not necessarily so. What I said was 'climbing-and-noisy teenagers.' You climb to that place and make noise in that place. Aren't you climbing-and-noisy teenagers?"</p>
<p>Another day, I happened to mention in the tea house, "I just saw a group of people outside drinking 'mediation tea,' banging on the tables and benches, even venting their anger on the teapot, punching it and breaking the teapot's spout." As I was speaking excitedly, this old gentleman interjected with a cold remark, "How can you say it's venting anger? They should knock off the teapot's mouth." I couldn't help but laugh and asked him the reason. The old gentleman finished smoking a tube of pipe tobacco, exhaled two streams of white smoke from his nostrils, and slowly said, "It's just because that mouth talks too much, argues too much, so it should be knocked off."</p>
<p>I have been ridiculed twice by the old gentleman. He is a senior, and I cannot argue with him. From then on, I kept a vigilant heart and dared not go to that tea house for tea again.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Tower in Lingnan</h3>
<p>— Qing Lin</p>
<p>In the northeastern part of Guangdong's provincial capital, there is a street called "Dashitou." It was once a district where music gatherings were abundant but is now renamed Yuexiu Road. West of the street is a mountain, called Yuexiu, also known as Baiyun, commonly called Guanyin Mountain. Halfway up the mountain is the Guanyin Temple, a place where pious men and women offer incense and pray to Buddha. It is rare to see a mountain within a city, and in its towering magnificence, it displays an extremely upright and refined charm. When Hong Xian (Yuan Shikai) claimed emperorship, Long Jiguang controlled Lingnan, obeying the Northern Court. It was not until the Revolutionary Army launched a joint attack that he fled to Hainan Island. Even in isolation overseas, he continued his separatist rule for a year. Initially, Li Xiehe led the armies of Fang Shengtao and Zhang Kairu to attack Guangdong. Long Jiguang was unwilling to give up his territory immediately, so he plundered the people's wealth and stubbornly resisted. He built fortresses on Baiyun Mountain and constructed a flying bridge directly to his headquarters. The sturdiness of the construction and the perfection of the equipment truly made it the most formidable defense project in terms of tactics. Remnants still exist to this day. Chen Jitang even learned from his old tricks, expanding and improving upon them. Therefore, today's Guangzhou has fortresses in all four suburbs.</p>
<p>At the peak of Baiyun Mountain, there is a towering building that rises high into the sky. The Cantonese people commonly refer to it as the "Five-Story Building." Its actual name is "Zhenhai Tower," an ancient building dating back thousands of years. It is believed to have been built by Zhao Tuo, King of Nanyue. On fine spring days, tourists climb to the top floor, overlooking the entire city's scenery, which is all within sight. In the distance, the Pearl River is visible, with sails and masts standing like a forest. The Humen fortresses, embracing the mountains and facing the sea, can also be vaguely seen. According to legend, although it has been repaired over the generations, its foundation remains extremely solid and unwavering. The walls, bricks, and tiles have been well-maintained, demonstrating the meticulous craftsmanship and the quality of the materials used in its construction. The entire building's beams and pillars are made of top-grade *nanmu* (Phoebe zhennan), with the main pillars being square-shaped and large enough to be embraced by arms. There are four of them, standing at the four corners of the southeast, northwest, and southwest. According to traditional Chinese architecture, the center of gravity relies on the pillars. As this is a five-story building, if the pillars were slightly weak, they would not be able to bear the load. In the late Qing Dynasty, there was a fire that almost caused it to be burned down. The guard of the tower tried to blame it on "heavenly fire" to shirk responsibility. Superstitious people echoed this, adding various embellishments, leading to all sorts of absurd and baseless stories. However, it is a pity that this giant pillar was scorched by the fire! I remember when I was a child in Guangdong, I loved to climb it on holidays. Now, it has been twenty years since I returned to my hometown. When I read Han Gaozu's line, "The great wind rises, the clouds fly," I couldn't help but feel a long-lost yearning!</p>

<h3>The Four Northeastern Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: Generals Indulge in Pleasure All Day, Soldiers Return Amidst the Weeping of Young and Old</p>
<p>Just as he reached the second gate, he saw Gan Jizhi and a nurse in white talking there. He was startled when the nurse called out, "Mrs. Zhao, who are you here to see?" As soon as she spoke, Guizhi recognized her as Huang Manying. She didn't know how she had ended up working as a nurse in such a place. She nodded and said, "Long time no see." At the same time, he turned his head and nodded to Jizhi. Jizhi's face was red, as if he was embarrassed. But he immediately realized that this was a solemn place and couldn't act like a lover. He put on a serious face and said, "Mrs. Zhao, are you here to see Company Commander Yin and ask about the whereabouts of Company Commander Zhao?" Guizhi said, "Yes. But Company Commander Tian, Company Commander Guan, they all..." She couldn't go on. Her throat tightened, and she choked. Jizhi said, "I work as a secretary here. I admire Company Commander Yin. I've talked to him several times and know the situation on the battlefield. You don't need to be sad. Company Commander Zhao..." Before he could finish, Huang Manying gave him a couple of winks. Jizhi had no choice but to stop himself. Guizhi had already seen it clearly and asked, "He... he... is he dead?" Manying said, "Don't worry. Let me take you to the waiting room to sit down, and then Jizhi will take you to talk to Company Commander Yin. In any case, you have to take care of yourself." As she reached out to support her, Guizhi saw an engagement ring on her hand. She immediately looked at Jizhi's hand and saw a similar ring. She thought to herself, at this moment, she was facing eternal separation from her husband, while others were enjoying marital reunion. By contrast, it made her even more heartbroken. Just then, a new batch of severely wounded soldiers arrived, being carried into the hospital on stretchers. This made her think of Zhao Ziqiang's situation. She felt extremely desolate but couldn't cry out loud, so she fainted and fell. Fortunately, Jizhi was quick and immediately caught her. In this desperate moment, she had at least fallen into the arms of her lover. But militarists would surely say, "For the wife of a soldier, this kind of outcome is very common."

<h3>Pawnbroking</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Although banks also accept collateral and engage in lending, those who seek loans from banks must have documents such as deeds, mortgages, stocks, government bonds, or valuable jewelry like diamonds to even be considered. Therefore, in Shanghai, although there are all kinds of banks—foreign, Chinese, large, and small—and countless of them, pawnbrokers and pawnshops, which are as densely packed as scales on a fish, are still thriving despite charging higher interest rates than banks.</p>
<p>Although pawnbrokers also accept collateral and engage in lending, pawnbroking is much more accessible to the common people than banks. In pawnshops, anything can be pawned. Gold rings and ivory chopsticks can be used as collateral, and even long gowns, short jackets, and trousers are considered good collateral. Items worth one or two hundred dollars can be pawned, and items worth three or five cents can also be sent to the high counter behind the white walls for a quick loan. It is said that in the Luandong area, some pawnbrokers run by foreigners even accept living people as pledges. This is indeed a new record in the history of pawnbroking, but accepting dumpling carts and cold noodle stalls as pledges is very common in Shanghai. In short, anything that is worth a few dollars and is not a completely useless piece of junk will be accepted by pawnshops.</p>
<p>Therefore, people generally call pawnshops "maternal uncle's home," meaning they can be consulted in times of emergency. Although pawnshop interest rates are at least 1.8% per month, and small pawnshops can charge as high as 3%, this is not considered exploitative profiteering but rather a service to the people. Therefore, pawnshops always hold the position of "maternal uncle's home."</p>

<h3>A Treasure Among Men (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>"The patient underwent surgery without feeling any pain, and recovered within a month. I never truly believed in Hua Tuo before, but seeing Dr. now, I believe that there are indeed people with miraculous skills in the world. Out of gratitude and admiration, I recount the experience to inform others with the same ailment, and to record my unforgettable gratitude!" This matter occurred five years ago. The preservative solution I used was initially salicylic acid, which was not durable. Later, I switched to boric acid glycerol, which remains intact to this day. After more than forty experiments, none could dissolve it. Only lightly oxidized potassium could slightly dissolve it. I realized that lightly oxidized potassium cannot be ingested, but heavy potassium bicarbonate can. Therefore, I made a solution of heavy potassium bicarbonate and added gallstones. After adding a small amount of tartaric acid, I saw it immediately start to boil, and the gallstones became active, appearing thinner. I took them out and weighed them on a chemical balance, and they had lost 3% of their weight. After repeating the process once more, they lost another 3%. After a total of thirty-four trials, they were completely dissolved. From this, I learned that heavy potassium bicarbonate is indeed a symptomatic medicine that is not difficult to take. Its taste is salty and slightly astringent, and the dosage can range from 0.5 fen to 1 qian. One fen can dissolve in 3 fen of water, but tartaric acid tastes extremely sour and is difficult to swallow. I realized that there is already acid in the stomach, so it is acceptable to drink grape wine. Therefore, I first stored dilute hydrochloric acid in a test tube to simulate stomach acid, added a small amount of grape wine, and then added gallstones. At this point, there was no reaction. When I added heavy potassium bicarbonate, it started to boil and digest more quickly. Taking it a step further, I tried the principle of mutual sensation between substances. I used gallstones as a guide, finely ground them, and mixed them with heavy potassium bicarbonate, storing them in capsules. I still simulated stomach acid as above, added grape wine, and then added the capsules, heating them to 37 degrees Celsius. Sure enough, they digested very quickly, and they were able to dissolve completely in just fourteen trials. Thus, I understood that I could cure the same disease. However, there was no one with this disease available to be tested. In September of the *ren shen* year, the daughter of my relative Mr. Gu was diagnosed by a doctor with stomach cancer that could only be cured with surgery. Mr. Gu did not dare to try surgery, and as they decided to go to the hospital for surgery, his daughter cried and said she would rather die than go. I tried it as a test. The daughter was good at drinking wine, so I added acid to the grape wine and provided it for her regular consumption. She drank it three times a day, each time about two *liang*. I supplemented it with the aforementioned capsules, three each time. One capsule's dose was 1 gram. Soon after taking it, she burped, and her chest and stomach felt much more relaxed, and she urinated a lot. Fearing that it would enter the bladder or turn into stones, I used an artificial Carlsbad salt method to change the heavy sodium bicarbonate to potassium and introduce it into the large intestine, excreting it through the feces. She gradually recovered, and because she returned to her hometown to sweep the tombs, she asked for a month's worth of medicine. A New Year's card came, saying that she had long been completely cured and had not relapsed since. She drinks three glasses of grape wine every day, and her appetite is also healthy. Now, she is married and has children. She is stronger than ever and has no illnesses all year round, probably because the iron in grapes can replenish blood. The amount of gallstones used was very small. The total amount was only 90 grams. If calculated using the price of *mabao* (horse bezoar), the retail price in pharmacies is 2 yuan per *fen*, so each gram would cost more than 5 yuan, which is also considerable. However, compared to hospitalization and surgery, the medical expenses are thousands of yuan or more, and the family suffers from fear and anxiety, as well as caring and nurturing for half a year, the cost of which is even more incalculable. Mr. Wang said it was a treasure among men, which is an ideal statement, but based on the facts, Miss Gu was saved by it. It can almost be said to be a treasure for saving lives. There are herbs called human yellow and human white, so it is appropriate to call it a treasure among men, isn't it?</p>

<p>Financial News: U.S. Government Vigorously Purchases Silver</p>
<h3>Spot Gold Plunges Again and Again</h3>
<p>Falling for Ten Consecutive Days Without Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Dropped Another 10 Yuan and a Half</p>
<p>Nearly Breaking the 50 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The gold market has been consistently weakened by the U.S. government's continuous purchases of silver. Yesterday, the market nearly broke through the 50 yuan mark. Although the situation stabilized midway, the buying side was discouraged and inactive, leaving a bleak outlook. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets reported that London and New York both rose, with the five-metal exchange's forward silver price rising nearly one fen and far rising three li and a half. London gold rose two and a half pence, exchange rates had rebounded, American cotton rose 45 pounds, American wheat rose 8.75, and stocks also rose. Market sentiment was still good. Although the opening price of gold fell, it was not much, dropping to 57 yuan. Hengyu, Yuqing, Yongfu, Xingyong, Yifeng, Yongda, Decheng, and others sold, and it continued to fall within 5 yuan. After the opening, although the bank's appetite was reduced, due to the lower prices, buyers were eager and the price rose, but there were many pullbacks. The HSBC listing revealed that the British pound rose 1.25 and the U.S. dollar rose 0.25. At this time, market sentiment was stable, and the price fluctuated, which was quite annoying. Later, the Central Bank opened with spot purchases, and the buying momentum in the market turned surging, and the gold market once became strong. However, the selling side was unwilling to show weakness, and supply increased after the price rose, and the market situation remained weak. However, the banking market was flat, and the balance of power between buyers and sellers was balanced, and it seemed to hover. The situation was generally stable, but under the threat of overseas silver markets, buyers were naturally cautious, while sellers were the opposite. Therefore, the underlying trend was ultimately weak, and Reuters' comments on silver by two London companies, due to the U.S. government's vigorous purchases, would inevitably rise sharply. The rumors were even worse, and the decline became even more severe. After the noon close, it once broke through the 50 yuan mark before stabilizing. The after-market was stable due to the Reuters report that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau would announce today that silver imports exceeding 100 yuan must have a certificate from that country. The bank bought again, and it rebounded. However, a report from Bombay that rose 11.9.11 anna, and speculator Mr. Wu's supply, it was difficult to support, and the gold market was still difficult to be optimistic. According to today's report on forward silver prices, the government bought 2.5 million ounces (100 transaction orders), and the remaining 53 orders were speculate on the near months to profit from selling further out months. It can be imagined that the inventory in the New York silver market is exhausted. However, after falling for nine consecutive days, everyone hoped that there would be a rebound, so buyers were still willing to be active. The price of red gold was 971.3 yuan, the source of spot goods became slow, and the spot exchange spread even increased to 9 yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>

Datong Li sold September U.S. dollars for 125, Dachangxiang, Dafayong, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, and Fuxingyong frantically sold, and it fell back to 4.1 yuan. Knowing in advance that the HSBC listing would rise 1.25 for the British pound and 0.25 for the U.S. dollar, but it was not much. Yongfeng and Dadecheng advanced to 5.7 yuan. The bank still sold November U.S. dollars for 375, and Tongchun and Tongtaichang still had selling appetite, and it fell back to 4.4 yuan.

HSBC bought October U.S. dollars for 25, and Yuanxing submitted orders, and the price rose again to over 6 yuan. After entering, market sentiment was not good, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yongyuanchang, and Yongda De Chenghong, Kangyong, and Yiyu sold to 3.5 yuan. The foreign telegraph was favorable for silver. Yuqing and Yongyifeng Yong submitted orders and pulled up 1 yuan. However, the domestic market hardened, and although the bank bought November U.S. dollars for 4375, it was difficult to sell. Yiyu Hengxing sold to 3 yuan. Tongfu Yiyu Yuqing Yongqingyu sold to 1.5 yuan. The Dalian gang took advantage of the low prices and still advanced, rising to 2.4 yuan. After entering, Yuqing, Yongqingyu, Yuanchun, Yuanmao, Yongchunyuan, Tongtaichang, Dingtai, Bingxing, and others were enthusiastic about selling. Fuxingyong Dadecheng, although there was maintenance, the noon close still fell to 951.1 yuan, and the goods were sold for 0.5 yuan. After the close, Tongtaichang Hengyu Fuyu Tianfeng Yong Hengchang and Yiyu all sold, and it fell below 50 yuan. Dafayong Zhaofengchang Hongxing bought vigorously, and the price rose to 51 yuan.</p>

Although Dacheng Yuqingyong sold to 2.7 yuan, Yuanchang and Yongda Decheng entered again, rising to 3.7 yuan. Fuyu sold at the upper market, and Yuqingyong also sold, falling to 2.6 yuan. The bank still bought December U.S. dollars for 5625 and November for 4375. Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Tianfengyong, Yuanyi, Qianchangxiang, and Yuqingyong also entered, but because Daxingyong Yuansheng Yongfu An Shunli offered supplies, it struggled at around 3 yuan. Forcing Yuqingyong Zhaofengchang Tianfengyong to buy again, and it rose to 4.2 yuan. There were still sellers taking advantage of the high prices, and it gradually fell back. When the Bombay telegraph reported a rise of 11 anna, a selling wave rose, and Huixiang Yuanmao Yong Yuqingyong Shunmao Daxingyong Dafayong Yiyu successively sold, and gradually fell to 0.7 yuan. Shenkang Fuchang took advantage of the low prices to submit orders, and the closing price rose back to 951.2 yuan, and the goods were sold for 1.7 yuan. After the close, goods, Hengtai, Dadecheng, Dingchang, Yuanmao, Yongda, Fenghheng, Zhaofengchang, Wanxing, and others all advanced, and it became more stable. The highest price of the day was 957.2 yuan, and the lowest price was 950.7 yuan, a difference of 6 yuan. As a result, it fell another 10.05 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>

The HSBC Bank's listing of British and American exchange rates revealed that the British rose 125 and the U.S. rose 25. The situation was calm after that, but market sentiment was still weak. As soon as the news that silver was favorable spread, Chinese merchants came to sell, and the process became even harder.

<h3>Deduction of Two Cents on Head Money Interest</h3>
<p>丨丨Discount rate still opens at 7 Cents丨丨</p>
<p>The demand for silver dollars in the market this month has been much more active than last month (July). Therefore, the rise and fall of head money interest varied. As the autumn season has arrived, foreign firms have started preparing goods, and the autumn harvest is also about to begin. The need for silver dollars is essential for agriculture. Although the market price of foreign exchange discount showed no movement, head money interest in the market rose by two cents again yesterday, with an estimated rate of four cents. Discount ticket transactions, early morning transfers, and new transactions amounted to over 3.2 million; afternoon transactions over 200,000; transactions at the Small General Association over 400,000; and the redemption and new transactions of silver dollar pledges totaled over 1.7 million.

<h3>Wide Angle Retreat, Copper Coins Also Contract</h3>

Jiangsu small foreign silver coins still opened at 835 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets, with no rise or fall for several days.

<p>Textile and Flower Manufacturers Cash Out</p>
<h3>Sudden Reversal in Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Japanese Shorts Aggressively Increase Positions</p>
<p>Floating Longs Waver, Prices Decline Across the Board</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply for two days, suddenly declined today. This kind of sharp advance and retreat makes it extremely difficult to grasp, mainly because speculators have been enthusiastic recently, with ample long and short positions, making the market more unstable. Current yarn sales are still active, and factories have withdrawn a significant amount of inventory. However, the sudden rise and fall in recent days, with a wide range, has led some factories to cash out during the intense price surge, and the funds absorbed by the financial sector have not yet been released. Judging from the current actual sales, it may be difficult to see a significant drop.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Plummets by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The benchmark yarn initial opening in the morning was still tight for this month, rising by six cents due to the favorable American cotton report for the longs. The next month remained unchanged, while distant months suddenly fell by seven or eight cents, and the market situation suddenly turned weak. This was because a yarn factory in Changzhou had cashed out several thousand bales the previous day, and several factories in Shanghai also sold short. Japanese firms also aggressively sold short again yesterday, while the flour merchants did not take any action. As a result, the market slackened, and the market rapidly changed drastically. Cotton opened down four cents this month, and floating longs were seen wavering again during the second and third rounds of trading. Selling pressure was especially heavy, and the more it was traded, the more it fell. According to large-scale observations, the price may initially fall slightly before rising again today. In the end, each month fell by 1.489 to 2.36 yuan. The total volume of transactions was 92,000 bales. It was found that 1,500 bales of Jifeng, 1,350 bales of Yuda, 4,050 bales of Dafeng, 3,350 bales of Huikang, 1,550 bales of Gengfeng, 3,800 bales of Yuande, 3,000 bales of Yuanyi, 2,850 bales of Changfeng, 2,450 bales of Dachang, and 900 bales of Tonghe were sold. 3,000 bales of Tongji, 1,800 bales of Hengyi, 1,000 bales of Delong, 1,850 bales of Yuanda, 1,400 bales of Taixing, 1,500 bales of Changji, 1,350 bales of Ruida, 1,950 bales of Senkang, 1,200 bales of Changyu, 2,500 bales of Renfeng, 3,100 bales of Taichang, 1,050 bales of Runkang, 2,000 bales of Xincheng, and 1,200 bales of Deji were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Benchmark Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance</p>
<p>August 185.7 183.3 183.3 Down 1.80 49,350</p>
<p>September 186.4 185.0 185.0 1.40 56,600</p>
<p>October 188.0 186.6 186.6 1.90 60,200</p>
<p>November 189.6 188.0 188.0 2.30 53,350</p>
<p>December 190.6 189.2 189.2 2.60 35,950</p>
<p>January 190.6 189.8 190.0 2.00 18,750</p>
<p>Total 274,200</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Weak at 2,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales are quite smooth. According to statistics, various firms bought a total of 1,945 bales throughout the day. The market situation is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts of various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 725 Tianjin 550 Nanyang 125 Jiangxi 25 Fellow Traders 210</p>
<p>Guangdong 10 Shantou 125 Henan 150 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>Inland 100 Haizhou 75 Zhenjiang 5 Xuzhou 20</p>
<p>Local Cotton Reverses and Falls</p>
<p>The US cotton government estimate was released at 9,193,000 bales. This amount is not far from private estimates, so the market atmosphere is still calm, up 45 points per pound. However, the extension of the exchange rate has failed to arouse enthusiasm in this port, and the large-scale dumping by Dafu and Yuanda has loosened the market. As the yarn market reversed and fell back, the cotton market also dragged downstream. Judging from the situation of US cotton, the market price is still difficult to look down on. However, as new cotton gradually appears in the country, the short side is more stable.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Drops Six Cents</h3>
<p>The benchmark cotton opened in the morning. Although the US cotton estimate was favorable to the longs and rose 45 points per pound, the exchange rate has risen for two consecutive days. The Shanghai cotton market has risen by eight or nine cents in the past two days, and the large-scale dumping by Dafu and Yuanda has loosened the market. Not only did people fail to get excited and rise, but instead tended to fall. At the same time, the yarn market reversed and fell back, and the cotton market became weaker. This month's situation is especially weak due to sufficient inventory. The distant months were constrained by it, and the market gradually declined from this. As a result, each month fell by 5 to 7.5 cents. The total transaction volume was 195,200 dan. It was found that 25,500 dan of Shenchang, 8,000 dan of Jifeng, 4,900 dan of Dafu, 5,600 dan of Tongji, 2,300 dan of Yuda, 7,400 dan of Dafeng, 9,200 dan of Huikang, 4,600 dan of Yuande, 6,300 dan of Yuanyi, 2,800 dan of Changfeng, 4,000 dan of Runkang, 3,300 dan of Xinheng, and 4,500 dan of Yuanxingchang were sold. 3,100 dan of Meiji, 2,800 dan of Hengyi, 2,100 dan of Daji, 4,400 dan of Yuanda, 7,400 dan of Gengfeng, 4,800 dan of Ruida, 3,700 dan of Junchang, 4,300 dan of Tongfeng, 3,500 dan of Shenji, 8,600 dan of Renfeng, 3,600 dan of Taichang, 11,800 dan of Dachang, 2,500 dan of Xiesheng, 3,500 dan of Tonghe, 4,600 dan of Xincheng, and 9,500 dan of Changhe were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Benchmark Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Comparison with Previous Day's Account Balance</p>

<h3>US Cotton Rises 45 Points per Pound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm initially due to the drought report, and then the market situation rose even more due to the government estimate favoring the longs and mass buying. As a result, spot goods rose 45 points per pound, and futures rose 43 to 47 points per pound. British cotton futures rose 24 to 26 points. Indian cotton waited for the US cotton government report, and the market situation was flat. Later, it softened due to long settlements. As a result, Pingle Oumula Bai Luoxi all fell 1 rupee 2.5 cents. The original telegram is recorded on the left (8th Telegraph):</p>

<h3>Grain is Changing Future Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>Factories Throwing Out More, Prices Suddenly Small Compared to Previous Market</p>
<p>New Buyers Covering Short Positions, Prices Head Back Up in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The price of foreign wheat flour rose two, three, or four cents yesterday, but market sentiment in the flour market has calmed down. Tianjin telegrams are down three cents, so customer accumulation stopped in the morning, and factories sold in large quantities, causing prices to suddenly decrease by six or seven cents. In the afternoon, new buyers and short covering suddenly absorbed the small prices, and the market rose sharply again by seven or eight cents. The final closing price for the current month was down three cents, the next month (November) down half a cent each, October unchanged, December up seventy-five, and January continued to rise by one and a quarter cents. Factories are now drawing current flour directly at list price, and there is insufficient flour in stock. It is said that new appearances will not be available until fourteen or fifteen days later.</p>
<p>The price of spot wheat rose to four and a half yuan yesterday. Factories thought it was too high, and there were not many transactions, up one cent from the previous day. The owners are still hoping for better prices. Futures wheat suddenly fell by one cent three to four cents to two cents two cents in the morning, because people's hearts were steady, and the longs sold out. It suddenly rose by one cent seven to eight cents in the afternoon, also because new stockpilers and short covering absorbed it. The closing price for the current month was still up two cents, the next month down four cents, October down seven cents, November down three cents, and December down one cent. January has not yet opened. Benchmark wheat margin is divided into four levels: 400, 500, 600, and 800, calculated according to the high and low market prices, namely within 4.2 yuan, 4.2 yuan to 4.4 yuan, 4.4 yuan to 4.6 yuan, and 4.6 yuan or more.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants and Long-Grain Stockpilers Unload</h3>
<p>Down One or Two Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, because of the rain a few days ago, foreign merchants and long-grain rice stockpilers have made money and are selling. Therefore, all kinds of rice fell uniformly after the market opened in the morning. However, the Jiangxi and Beiyang firms still wanted to accumulate and immediately bought at the low prices. The market turned better again at noon. Although the market was good, stockpilers continued to sell, and foreign rice orders will arrive at the port one after another. Newly promoted sellers are also active. As a result, the price of small pressed rice was lowered by two cents, and the prices of other long-grain rice were lowered by a cent. Throughout the day, local merchants purchased a total of 2,300-2,400 bags of hulled and unhulled long-grain rice from this street. The Jiangxi and Beiyang firms divided up 5,000 bags of small pressed rice.</p>
<h3>Sales of Hexia Rice Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, due to the clear weather, all the ships that were blocked have arrived at the port, totaling more than forty ships (about six thousand stones of goods). However, the sales market on this street is still sluggish. Those who make Houjing rice are rare, and the market price has fallen by three or four cents. Fortunately, the Qingdao firms continued to take 1,000 bags of late rice, so the market color was more stable. However, customers prefer to select special goods, resulting in the soft overall market by about two cents. Looking back at the overall situation, the local market has no appetite at all, and its foundation is very weak. It is impossible to rely solely on contracted sales. Moreover, the Qingdao firms only take for a short period. Therefore, it is speculated that there will still be no aesthetic appearance in the next few days. The Du Yangjian rice is tired and has fallen by more than a corner. As the arrival of goods has turned into a surge, sales are sluggish, and prices have also fallen by two or three cents. Pudong's new rice still opens at 11.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were more than ten shipments from Hexia, and sales of various colors were sparse. The market situation saw slight declines of one or two cents for Baijing Yangjian rice, while Baiyuan rice was stable in price, but weakly in secret. Thin rice prices were weak by nearly a corner, and Dujian rice was slightly outside of a corner. The rest were generally weak. Dongxin rice still had no ups and downs.</p>
<h3>The Wind of Rising Soybean Oil Subsides</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rising wind in the soybean oil market unanimously contracted. In fact, flour and wheat prices were declining, and the preparation of soybean oil also fell. Therefore, people's hearts were not stable, and the oil market received a telegram that it fell by one yuan. Generally, buyers have no demand for transactions, and the market is deserted. Both new and old soybeans fell. The old bean factories are not moving, only local retail sales are occurring. The sellers joined in with the stockpilers unloading, so the market fell by one cent and four or five points. The number of transactions totaled five or six cartloads of various beans. Among the new beans, only the white goods of June in Hankou were less, and the market was tight. Jiujiang Chengmen beans fell by one cent compared to the previous day. It is estimated that 70 bags of white in June were traded at a price of 4.8 yuan, and Chengmen beans opened at 600 bags at a price of 4.4 yuan to 4.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Still Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>Various Items Down Five Cents to Three and a Half Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange still showed no signs of improvement. However, trading increased considerably. Both large buyers and sellers were quite lively. Market prices were still being suppressed by high pressure and failed to rally. In terms of the environment, such as the financial community's request to amend the bank savings regulations, the Ministry of Finance already has a clear statement that it is difficult to change. This means that a large amount of bonds will be sealed and cannot be moved. Market positions will inevitably feel a shortage one day. However, the large number of floating longs still being unloaded means that although there is no shortage of large buyers taking the opportunity to absorb them, the selling pressure is still strong and the market is weak. Predicting the future, it should not be too small. Yesterday, the opening of troop reductions and demobilization was a good start, rising five cents to two and a half cents. Afterwards, it gradually became powerless. Various items all showed weakness and listlessness. It is estimated that it declined by five cents to two cents. The trend in the second round was still sluggish, with most items continuing to decline by five cents, one cent to three and a half cents. Only the unified tax still rose five cents to one and a half cents, which shows that the market temporarily does not feel much about the current situation, and only has slight ups and downs according to the supply and demand of positions. The results of the market price show declines of five cents, one cent to three and a half cents. The total number of transactions is estimated to be about 15 to 16 million yuan. The comparative table of its rise and fall results is listed on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Gold and Silver Stocks Most Popular</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (August 8th), the New York stock market saw investment buying in railroad stocks, and stocks of various roads traveling to agricultural areas were slightly shorted. Furthermore, the government's cotton report was favorable to the longs, and commodities soared. The price of pigs in Chicago and Kansas City reached the highest peak in several years. The market situation improved slightly. Due to the arid weather, ticket holders were cautious, so railroad stocks have been sold off extremely often recently. The market has entered an oversold state, so it has turned firm. Gold and silver stocks are very strong. Holmes Stock Gold Mine not only announced a quarterly dividend of one yuan, but also issued a bonus of two yuan. However, although market sentiment has improved, trading is still light, and small transactions have not yet escaped the maneuvering situation. In the bond market, railroad bonds fell sharply by as much as nine yuan. US government bonds were slightly loose, and the rest saw mixed ups and downs. Although there were terrible long-term profit-taking in the miscellaneous grain market, the upward trend is very obvious. The total volume of transactions for the day was 690,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>August 7th 8th Ups and Downs</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 97.47 88.97 Up 1.50</p>

<h3>Southern Goods, Southern Water Chestnut Poor Harvest, Again Rising Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Nantang Water Chestnut Ginger, recently, due to drought and no rain in the production area, is bound to have a poor harvest. The Shanghai market is rising sharply, and it is heard that the existing stock has been closed by a certain company exclusively, making it easier to raise the price. Therefore, the sales price in the market yesterday reached 75 yuan, up another ten yuan from before. It is still expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Broad Sales of Woolen Cloth, Woolen Yarn, and Thread</h3>
<p>丨Japanese Goods Opening at Four Meters Still Rarely Inquired About丨</p>
<p>Woolen yarn and thread have been quite active recently. Most of the transactions in recent days have been medium-coarse single-strand types. The prices of medium-coarse goods are quite poor, but high-end medium-coarse velvet is very firm, because it can be sold as coarse velvet, with prices ranging from 2.45 yuan per pound. Customer sales are still quite smooth. The arrival of single-strand goods has been limited recently, and the price is also firm. Yesterday, 40 pieces shipped by the Hankou firm were transacted at a price of 2.15 yuan. Japanese opening-at-four-meter goods have remained unaffected since the surge in volume and price crash. The lowest price for this product is only 2.4 yuan per pound, but it is still rarely inquired about.</p>

<p>Shanghai Newspaper Local Supplement</p>
<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>A Few Idle Words on Mr. Jiawei's Critique of a Smaller Problem</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I wrote an article, "A Few Words on Several Minor Issues Raised by Mr. Cao Regarding the Popular Language," which was published in the supplement. This caused a misunderstanding with Mr. Jiawei, who also wrote "A Review of a Smaller Problem in the Discussion of the Popular Language." Naturally, he expressed deep dissatisfaction with my opinions. But is my mind just dull and slow, or is it because I lack ink in my belly? The more Mr. Jiawei critiques, the more confused I become.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiawei's rebuttal to my article is divided into four points. However, these so-called four points are vast in meaning and mixed in ideas, with repeated errors, making a comprehensive debate impossible. I can only casually point out the points of Mr. Jiawei's misunderstanding and correct them. Therefore, the writing inevitably becomes too long, causing the editor to have a headache, and taking up a large portion of the valuable space in the supplement, just like the Japanese occupying a large area of territory for no reason. I am deeply sorry for this.</p>
<p>The original text states (i.e., the following is from Mr. Jiawei's original text): "Everything in human society will never be freely transcended by you beyond history, and the generation and development of this problem are determined by objective historical conditions."</p>
<p>Indeed, the occurrence of all events is always subject to objective historical conditions. Even the transition from classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese has historical characteristics. Confucius said, "Just make the meaning clear." Li Bai's and Du Fu's poems, which even old women could understand, were also intended to be simple and clear. Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty said that ancient people wrote to clarify morality, communicate worldly affairs, and the words of ancient books were all clear and easy to understand. Nowadays, scholars write only to convey principles and clarify worldly affairs, without using flowery language. Later, Mr. Tang Shunzhi more clearly advocated vernacular Chinese. This is a historical fact. During the May Fourth Movement, people like Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu advocated vernacular Chinese, but in fact, they were only expanding and enriching the sayings of Song Dynasty scholars, the colloquial stories of the Song Dynasty, and vernacular literary forms such as "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber." In reality, there was not much creation. This is based on historical evidence. Therefore, Confucius said, "The Yin dynasty inherited the rites of the Xia dynasty, and what it subtracted and added can be known. The Zhou dynasty inherited the rites of the Yin dynasty, and what it subtracted and added can be known." It can be seen that history is "gradual" and not "sudden." If people today, seeing Hu Shi and others making a splash, also want to play around with a popular language, I'm afraid it will be more effort than it's worth.</p>
<p>The original text also states, "In today's society, due to the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, there is continuous development, and the popular language is an inevitable product of the social trend towards collectivization."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Jiawei, each era has its own products: classical Chinese for the monarchical era, vernacular Chinese for the republican era, popular language for the current era, and perhaps something like Cheng Yaojin becoming a Grand Marshal for a later era – a big circle for merit, a big stroke for demerit.</p>
<p>The original text also states, "The term 'the masses' must represent the masses who can bear the mission of historical development and the progress of the times and can move forward."</p>
<p>This is originally a representative system. The general public naturally cannot bear such a significant mission, and those who can are naturally a few gentlemen with eloquent tongues and eyes like copper bells. However, representative systems, such as the former advisory councils, national assemblies, and provincial assemblies, have also had such a set of tricks. In the end, there was only bribery, fighting, table-flipping, and ink-throwing. Representative systems are only like this. The current representative system has been in chaos for a long time, and I can't see any achievements. What is the reason?</p>
<p>The original text also says that the popular language and popular literature cannot be discussed separately. Anyone who pays a little attention to philology knows this. Popular literature is not something that has only been proposed today. A discussion and production of it occurred a long time ago.</p>
<p>I have my reasons for advocating separate discussions. Mr. Jiawei ignores my reasons, which is like fitting a cow's head to a horse's face, and then says that there has been a discussion and production of it. Forgive my ignorance, I have heard of the discussion, but I have not seen the production. I don't know what the produced popular language is like? And since it has already been produced, why is there a need to discuss it again at this time?</p>
<p>The original text also says, "The popular language proposed today only needs to be something that can be written, understood, and spoken."</p>
<p>Such language seems very convenient: if you can write it, you can hear it; if you can hear it, you can speak it. There is no need to discuss it carefully. I'm afraid this kind of language cannot be created by human power. Only God can create it. However, after God created the world in six days, He needs to rest on Sunday. I'm afraid He doesn't have the energy to create a popular language for us again?</p>
<p>The original text also says that the construction of the popular language will become the simplest, most widespread, and complete tool for educating the masses; and the construction of popular language and literature, along with other departments such as popular films and dramas, is relatively raising the cultural level of the masses.</p>
<p>What I want to study is what kind of tool this is: an ax, a chisel, a hoe, or an iron rake? What is the form of this tool? The popular language has not yet been produced, but movie theaters and theaters already exist, which is strange. And to say that the cultural level will be raised in these places is even stranger. Now things are only following the masses. Why do we need to raise their culture? I didn't know where the popular language was before. Now, thanks to Mr. Jiawei's guidance, I have found it – it's in movie theaters and theaters! I am really happy. However, the popular language in theaters and movie theaters is raising the level of the ladies, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies, not raising the level of the general laborers, coolies, and farmers.</p>
<p>The original text also says that there has been a lot of discussion on the problem of discarding and developing dialects and localisms in the construction of the popular language, so there is no need to say much about it here.</p>
<p>Why is there no need to say much about it here? This is the most serious core of discussing this issue. Because the discussions from all sides have not produced practical and good solutions, it is truly as Mr. Cao Juren said, "There is only the clamor of gongs and drums, but no officials appearing on stage." Therefore, we need to discuss it. But Mr. Jiawei says that there has been a lot of discussion on all sides, so there is no need to say much about it. According to this, Mr. Jiawei's long article of several hundred words is also redundant.</p>
<p>I have read several of Mr. Jiawei's articles in the supplement and deeply admire them. But this article is very contradictory in content and avoids practical discussion, only circling on the surface, which is incomprehensible. I have already written a lot here and cannot go into further detail. However, since Mr. Jiawei has joked about my flawed writing, I cannot help but say a few words and make a joke as well. If Mr. Jiawei thinks this is an insult and becomes very angry, and then writes another review, I cannot handle it. I can only give a warning and ask Mr. Jiawei not to get angry.</p>
<h3>From Bound Feet to Women's Liberation</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>In the past, judging the beauty of a woman depended entirely on the size of her feet. Three-inch golden lotuses were the standard of beauty. Thus, beautiful women swayed like willows in the wind, with light and graceful figures, able to do nothing but burn incense under the moon and play the xiao in front of the window. A pair of small feet was also deeply hidden within the silk skirt, unwilling to be easily shown to others. Those with a fetish for feet, the most famous in history, were the great massacres that took pleasure in piling up small feet.</p>
<p>Now, in 1934, the high tide of women's liberation resounds to the skies, and the red silk ribbons of the foot-binding woman no longer evoke a sense of beauty in people. On the contrary, the bigger the feet, the better. One can run dozens of miles and jump several feet high (although one also puts on high-heeled leather shoes and twists and sways when running into the dance floor, this is another matter and not worth mentioning). A pair of feet like footboards can jump and bounce, earning the respect of martial artists.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of the superiority or inferiority of size, but a matter of different times. In the era of small feet, people risked their lives to bind them with foot-binding cloths that were several feet long. In the era of large feet, people run, jump, leap, and climb walls. The former was because women were confined in the towers of feudalism, and they had to do this to win the favor of men. The latter are awakened women who have shouted slogans such as women's liberation. Naturally, forging a healthy physique is the first step towards liberation. They are unwilling to be accessories to men under the yoke of economics, and they want to compete with men in society and politics. However, time is like a golden hoop. After several women's liberation movements, they broke free from the old chains, but were invisibly imprisoned by new chains. Although their feet have grown larger, they have not obtained what they hoped for.</p>
<p>According to the import surveys of cosmetics and lace, the daughters of the era of large feet have only overthrown the painful sacrifice of three-inch golden lotuses. They are still trapped in this golden hoop like Sun Wukong.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Those in the midst of a situation are confused, while those on the sidelines are clear." This saying has some truth to it. Small-footed girls simply do not know the status of women. If small feet are the standard of beauty, then they grit their teeth and make them smaller. And there are even songs praising their merits, saying "From now on, all parents in the world will not value sons over daughters," covering their eyes and running into the maze, not knowing what they have been doing until their beauty fades and they die. Now, their feet have grown larger, and the slogans they shout are very fashionable. Seeing men as enemies, and if someone says "vase" or "signboard," they launch a naval, land, and air force attack, earning a paper victory of gender equality. In reality, they are also spinning in the maze, but this time they are doing it with their eyes open, embracing the ambition of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" to become heroes. But think about the taste of eating mute pills with your eyes open.</p>
<p>After writing this, I know that I have caused another great disaster. However, I am not waving a feather fan to make a "borrowing arrows" deal. These past two days, reading the newspapers has made me feel a bellyful of frustration. I want to ask the big-footed girls to jump out of the maze and take a look at the people applauding and cheering on all sides!</p>
<h3>Lamenting Han Juntianfang</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>It seems to have become a fashionable trend for literary figures to be valued after their death. Today, upon receiving Mr. Chen's letter of condolence for Weinong, I learned that my friend Tianfang had passed away on July 1st. I couldn't help but feel sad for a long time. Upon examining my stationery cabinet, I still have two unpublished manuscripts. Because they have lost their timeliness, they can't be published. I originally could have added the words "posthumous works" to give my friend a little posthumous fame. However, Han Jun has a spirit, and I know that he would definitely not want to do this. I will just casually discard them and end this case. What use is it to have glory after death when literary figures have nothing to eat when they are alive?</p>
<p>I met Tianfang at a dinner party last autumn. He was employed in the editorial department of the World Book Company. This spring, he was transferred to the second editorial department in Suzhou. We had only been together for less than half a year, and our last meeting at the newspaper office became our eternal farewell. The conversation at the time of parting seemed to be a prophecy of his departure.</p>
<p>That afternoon, he came to the editorial office to see Mr. Shutong and said that he was leaving for Suzhou that evening. If there was an opportunity in Shanghai, he would return immediately. As long as he could make a living, he wouldn't care about anything.</p>
<p>"Why be so attached to Shanghai?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Actually, a change of environment is also good, but it seems like I can't leave Shanghai."</p>
<p>"I really want to go to Suzhou."</p>
<p>"It's a pity that we can't exchange jobs!"</p>
<p>Because he still had some trivial matters to finish before leaving, he asked us to visit Suzhou during the spring break this year. "It's paradise over there!" he said with a smile before leaving.</p>
<p>This smile ended his life. The life of paradise is ultimately not something that ordinary people like us can enjoy. The reason why he couldn't leave Shanghai was probably because of this.</p>
<p>I received two letters from him this spring. I really wanted to take a short trip to clear my head, but literary figures have to eat every day when they are alive, and they don't have the good fortune to travel during the spring break. Besides, Suzhou is paradise! Thus, we missed our last chance to meet. However, in hindsight, it is also good, the so-called "beauty of imperfection" in poetry. Although separation and death are the most painful situations in life, there is no feast in the world that does not end. Leaving this sinful world to go to the Land of Ultimate Bliss is a path that many people are running towards.</p>
<p>Tianfang is dead. His colleagues at the dinner party will surely lament that heaven did not grant him more years, but what does it matter to the deceased? Therefore, I titled my lament for Han Juntianfang to lament why he had to come to this world as a passerby. Since he is dead, and is a person who has not benefited the country or the family, even if he is said to be a promising young man!</p>
<h3>On the Rice Fields</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>The people of Xu Village have already despaired! There are many rice seedlings that have not been planted, and those that have been planted are wilting under the scorching sun, showing signs of death. Even if a heavy rain of two or three feet deep fell immediately, it probably wouldn't be able to revive the short, yellow early rice that is lying weakly in the iron-hard, cracked paddy fields. But looking at the sky, it is still a bow-shaped sheet of green iron, thickly covering people's hopes. They have long known that they are in despair, but they are still desperately running to the shallow river two or three miles away to grab water, as if they would not rest in peace if they did not do this work of blood and sweat!</p>
<p>Changfu's mother happened to be in labor, writhing in pain on the edge of the bed. Sweat soaked through her cloth clothes. Changfu watched his mother in so much pain, but he could do nothing but cry with her. He had to bite the bullet and run out of the dilapidated house, thinking of calling his father back from the field.</p>
<p>Xu Da was carrying two buckets of muddy water that he had snatched with all his might. He was running quickly with his bare back, and the beads of sweat squeezed out of his back slipped down, reflecting on the ground along his footprints, but they were swallowed by the sun in an instant.</p>
<p>"Dad! Mom..."</p>
<p>"Good, Changfu! You came at the right time, quickly put those two buckets on your shoulders and go with me to the stinky river in the west to grab water!"</p>
<p>"Dad! No, Mom is..."</p>
<p>"Don't be nagging! You've been hiding at home and playing enough. Hurry up and come with me. The Chebian Pond and the River Temple are already completely dry. There's still some water at the stinky river, but if we're late, it will be snatched by others!"</p>
<p>Xu Da said, and started walking with the load on his shoulders. Changfu didn't dare to say anything more and followed, shedding tears.</p>
<p>It was already evening, but the sun was still fiercely chasing and burning them, scorching Changfu's skin. His eyes were blurry and confused, and his body was about to faint, but he didn't dare to sit down and rest for even a minute. Carrying this load on his shoulders for half the day, blisters had almost formed, and his leg bones were weak and trembling, but he still followed Xu Da desperately.</p>
<p>"Little devil, hurry up and carry before the night is completely dark! Don't you see how dry the fields are? If we have another famine this year, do you think we'll have rice to eat?" Xu Da scolded Changfu and urged him to hurry up.</p>
<p>The gentle breeze of the evening brushed Changfu's face, and his mind seemed to clear up a bit. He suddenly remembered the scene of his mother writhing in pain on the bed, and he knew that his mother hadn't eaten anything for the past two days... It was as if he could hear his mother's moaning cries: "Changfu! ... Changfu! Chang..."</p>
<p>"Dad!" he said with a burst of courage, "Will it be okay if I carry this load?"</p>
<p>Xu Da didn't answer, as if he hadn't heard, and continued running towards the river with the load on his shoulders. So Changfu perked up his spirits and asked again:</p>
<p>"Dad, can I go back?"</p>
<p>Xu Da immediately turned around, "What!"</p>
<p>"Mom is writhing in pain at home, calling me!"</p>
<p>"Who heard that, you idiot! If the fields die, not even your mother will be spared. We will all die!" Although Changfu didn't dare to disobey and run away, his heart had already run past the rice fields, stumbled into the house, and was crying and comforting his mother. His mind was filled with images of his mother writhing in pain, and he could only hear his mother's cries: "Changfu! ... Changfu, Chang..."</p>
<h3>A Failed Subject</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Dark home! Your son, who has wandered overseas for five years, has returned!</p>
<p>Home? You have a rotten soul, a moldy hall, a melancholy heart, and annoying noises... Home! Home!</p>
<p>Mother laughed until tears flowed. She stammered, "You're here today? You're here today?" She couldn't say anything else. How could I not return for your sake, you lovely face?</p>
<p>Grandmother had the face of a child with the hair of a crane, and was as healthy as ever. She gazed at her grandson approaching and said, "Is that Cheng'er? Is that Cheng'er? Oh, you've grown taller? Grown taller? Seeing you makes me so happy, so happy!"</p>
<p>Father sat smiling in a back chair in the corner of the hall. You kind old man!</p>
<p>The children found two crocodiles in my travel basket. They were frightened and ran away at first, then they watched, and finally they picked them up and played with them.</p>
<p>Thus, escaping from the embrace of the lovely, warm equatorial country, I had fallen back into this ancient family.</p>
<p>But dark home! This place has a broken soul, a moldy hall, a melancholy heart, and annoying noises...</p>
<p>Again unable to endure the encirclement of this rotten atmosphere, and wanting to escape the oppression that this ancient, dilapidated old house placed upon the wandering son, I then slipped out of that tall and solemn doorway.</p>
<p>Oh, the old feudal family!</p>
<p>But as the time passed on the belly of the monster, the fire wheel carrying me, I thought of this dark old house again. The moment of parting: mother's tears flowed, grandmother was dazed, father's face sank into a bitter smile, and the adorable siblings clung to my clothes, crying and refusing to let go.</p>
<p>Thinking of the gloomy old house made my head ache; but thinking of the people who loved me far away from that place, how could my heart not pound with pain?</p>
<p>Oh, dark old house that I had stayed in for ten days like a hotel after five years of separation, goodbye! Grandmother, parents, and adorable siblings, please forgive your wandering son and brother who is flowing with the times!</p>
<p>Oh, when will there be a new home to support you?</p>
<h3>Soviet Youth's Flying Game (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— (Moscow Dispatch) (Yin Yuan)</p>
<p>(3) A beautiful picture</p>
<p>During the Aviation Festival last August, there was such a beautiful sight in the location of the school. That is, sixty-two paratroopers jumped bravely into the air at the same time from a squadron of airplanes. Sixty-two sunflowers of various colors bloomed instantly in the blue sky and white sun. These sixty-two paratroopers all belonged to the school. Due to their brave example, they attracted many new members. Now, in one place in Moscow, there are dozens of paratrooper research groups, most of them in factories. Schools and groups have also been established in various provinces, in Ukraine, and in major cities such as Rostov and Leningrad.</p>
<p>The effect of paratrooping on the human body structure has not yet been studied in detail, but the school plans to begin studying this issue this year. What is particularly worth pointing out here is that people over the age of forty can also learn this game with great success.</p>
<p>This game is definitely not limited to men, because many women have already had multiple successful falls and have become instructors. Some men have refused to jump multiple times due to fear, but this has never happened among women, which is indeed a noteworthy thing. If a woman has decided to jump, she will resolutely carry out her resolution.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual style of paratrooping, the above-mentioned school also teaches people to descend slowly. This type of descent starts from a height of several thousand meters and requires a lot of strength and courage to achieve. Here, the paratroopers will jump from a long distance at a high altitude and wait until they are only a few hundred meters from the ground before releasing the parachute. The effect obtained from this type of jump that has already been tested can prove that the human body structure can maintain strong effort.</p>
<p>In short, parachuting has practical and scientific value, and the Soviet Union is commonly developing this game.</p>
<h3>On the River</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>On the river, the ocean wind is blowing quite fiercely. Almost, the gentleman's white cork hat was blown away.</p>
<p>Fei sat on the stern of the boat, and the waves splashed up like raindrops. It was pitch black all around, and only the sound of the rushing river could be heard. The light of the lighthouse flashed on and off every second. Looking back at Shanghai, it was shrouded in a red cloud, hazy.</p>
<p>The boat was interwoven with glaring lights, and the radio broadcast charming melodies. Several blue-eyed foreigners hummed "La la! La la la" all the way to Wusong.</p>
<p>On the white canvas chairs, everyone had a smile on their lips. The fragrance of 4711 irritated the nose and was blown away by a gust of sea wind, then dissipated in another gust. The women's hair was blown into a mess by the gusts of sea wind. Western ladies pressed their delicate hat brims against their permed hair.</p>
<p>Frivolous laughter enveloped the entire deck. On the river, every young couple was wasting their youth.</p>
<p>A bald gentleman was lying sound asleep on a rattan chair. His snores were scattered in the melody of the ocean wind. Two companions of the opposite sex teased his sleeping posture and smiled, while they leisurely smoked cigarettes, gazing at the star-filled sky.</p>
<p>Sipping beer, the cool river breeze caressed their faces. How tasteful it was, watching the moving postures of everyone. The women of June possessed a multifaceted temptation, seducing the wavering youth under the city's erotic culture. Bright red lychees and silver apricots were thrown into the heart of the river, the faint sound of the waves floating away with the white foam at the stern of the boat.</p>
<p>Qingning Temple and Donggou gradually fell behind; the street lights along the river in Gaoqiao could be seen. The wind suffocated everyone, blowing the shawls on the women's shoulders, like the wings of the Statue of Liberty waving.</p>
<p>Pairs of couples slipped onto the dock. The shadows of the dimly lit buses were moving. The road towards the Seaside Hotel.</p>
<p>The engine of the yellow ferry started again, and there were fewer people on the deck. Wearily leaning back in the chair, touring the night Huangpu River, I scattered back into the urban crowd with a cool heart.</p>

<h3>Simpleton (3)</h3>
<p>— Lin Bin</p>
<p>"Simpleton, fetch me water! I'll give you fragrant rice to eat."</p>
<p>"Fetch me some water too, simpleton. I have old wine as potent as tiger's blood!"</p>
<p>"Do you want to eat honey-sweet white rice candy? If you do, fetch me water!"</p>
<p>All sorts of honey-sweet, crisp voices floated from all directions into the simpleton's ears, pricking his nerves like needle tips, causing an odd excitement to rise throughout his body. He kept glancing this way and that, humming, "So pretty, so pretty!" Finally, he gave them all a common answer:</p>
<p>"Carry, carry!"</p>
<p>And so, amidst admiring murmurs and enthusiastic encouragement, one load, two loads, three loads... "Rest a while, simpleton! Eat something before carrying more!"</p>
<p>The simpleton cheerfully obeyed.</p>
<p>Then another load, two loads, three loads...</p>
<p>Carrying water wasn't the most strenuous task for a strong farmer, but a pair of large cypress buckets, famous throughout the village (seven or eight times out of ten, they would borrow these buckets when asking the simpleton to carry water), combined with the slippery, rain-soaked path where one could easily fall, and the round trip distance of a full "li" (about half a kilometer), were not easy for the simpleton, whose flesh was gradually separating from his large bones under the torment of an inhuman existence. After carrying ten loads of brimming well water in a row, he panted like an old ox overworked on a hot day, his legs trembling, unable to stand steady. As usual, he first sat for a moment on the edge of the steps, and then leaned back, silently lying on his back on the cool, shady mud.</p>
<p>"Oh, are you tired, simpleton? Rest a while longer! Rest and then fetch me a few loads too. I'll be your matchmaker!"</p>
<p>The simpleton weakly shook his head, indicating that he couldn't carry any more.</p>
<p>"Rest a while longer. If you can't carry full loads, carry half loads, I'll be your matchmaker!"</p>
<p>And so, in less than half an hour, the carrying pole with the heavy cypress buckets was once again pressing down on his shoulders.</p>

<h3>Banning Male-Female Co-starring Films Amidst the Retro Movement (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Dan Feng</p>
<p>The era has progressed to 1934, truly a strange year in China. This is not only because the heat is reaching levels unseen in sixty years, but more importantly, the insane retro movement is making us feel most surprised and most afraid.</p>
<p>The so-called retro movement naturally aims to return China to a very ancient era, or in other words, to drive backwards, as everyone says. But driving backwards is a very difficult task after all, because there is always the danger of pushing the passengers in the carriages into deep pits or large rivers. If this were to happen, the poor passengers would naturally die unjustly, but the commanders in the engine room could ignore this. However, even so, the retro movement is indeed being vigorously promoted by the literati and gentlemen, who are shouting themselves hoarse. Regarding their achievements, we can cite many, from the revival of classical Chinese to the prohibition of men and women walking together… they are almost magnificently abundant. And now, according to newspaper reports, in Guangdong, the place that opened up to the outside world earliest and is the cradle of revolution, it has already progressed (?) to banning male-female co-starring films.</p>
<p>Here, regarding that grand and righteous ban, it seems necessary to respectfully transcribe and reprint it. "(1) Men and women are prohibited from riding in the same vehicle, (2) Men and women are prohibited from eating together (regardless of government offices, families, teahouses, or restaurants, men and women are uniformly prohibited from eating together. Women must wait until the men have finished eating before they can eat.), (3) Men and women are prohibited from living together (hotels are uniformly prohibited from allowing men and women to live in the same room.), (4) Military personnel and civilians are prohibited from walking together, (5) Movie theaters are prohibited from showing films with male and female co-stars. As for General Chen Bonan's advocacy of venerating the classics and restoring antiquity, and Naval Commander Zhang Zhiying's proposal to prohibit men and women from swimming together and to differentiate between men and women with loose hair, all cases have been fully passed and implemented by the association." In front of the ban, there are still the following sentences that must be copied verbatim: "Since the New Life Movement, in addition to the so-called ban on men and women walking together, there are also so-called orders prohibiting men and women from living and eating together, and the Guangdong Political Research Association has further passed the following gender boundaries." Moreover, the reporter was even bolder later, and added an editor's note saying: "However, the young men and women of the general era all believe it is extremely boring and strongly oppose it."</p>
<p>The above articles, from one to four, can be said to be outside the scope of this article, only the fifth article concerning the instructions to the movie theaters, then we really only have to call for grievance and injustice. Needless to say, film, in this situation, can only die out completely. The reason is very simple, because film is an art that reflects the reality of society, and society has men and women, it was so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future, then naturally there must be men and women in films as well. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Looking for Trouble"</h3>
<p>— Dan Feng</p>
<p>Looking for Trouble, Nanjing</p>
<p>Not long ago, Cathay screened a Warner Bros. production called "The Voice of the City," which was themed around telephones, writing about a brave and resourceful telephone worker who, because of his diligent service, and especially his efforts to help an old boss recover lost funds, ended up getting some rewards and marrying a female telephone operator. Now, this "Looking for Trouble" produced by 20th Century Fox is also themed around telephones, also writing about a telephone worker who, after working hard and accomplishing great things, happily marries an operator.</p>
<p>The content of the films being so similar is by no means an accidental fact. On the contrary, it precisely illustrates how filmmakers are vying for audiences. However, they do not compete in terms of content, but merely in hunting for the same themes. Thus, one company begins filming a movie with the theme of playing ball, and soon everyone rushes to imitate it, and movies about playing ball become popular for a while. In addition, beast films or detective films have all filled the market for a time, and in the future, perhaps there will be several more films based on telephones appearing? This is very possible.</p>
<p>But we believe that if we compare Fay Enright's "Voice of the City" with this William Wellman's "Looking for Trouble," then we will think that the latter is inferior to the former. In this film, we certainly cannot say that there are no achievements at all, at least a few witty remarks are very amusing. But comparatively speaking, relying solely on a few witty remarks cannot cover up the excessive dull scenes in the play, and among them, the three more tense parts, (1) Uncle Duke digging a tunnel to steal funds until Joe and Kaiser are captured, (2) Joe pressing the fire alarm to send out the fire truck fleet, (3) The sudden earthquake: none of them can excellently grab the audience's emotions. Especially the latter two, the director uses them as climaxes, but because the transition from climax to low point is too fast, people feel that the climax did not fully exert its due power, resulting in us feeling that the two climaxes were superfluous. Regarding this point, it is naturally the relationship of editing, the director's montage is indeed not very brilliant. Compared with "Voice of the City," the consistent maintenance of humor from beginning to end is enough to show the weakness of this film.</p>
<p>There is a kind of film that is a victory of formalism, making people unable to directly feel the vulgarity and unpleasantness of the story, while there is a kind that cannot hide the emptiness or mediocrity of the content. "Looking for Trouble" should belong to the latter type.</p>
<p>We believe that good actors can never unfold their skills in mediocre directing techniques. Spencer Tracy acted very well in Frank Borzage's "Man's Castle," but here he is only competent. Jack Oakie is okay, but Constance Cummings is again mediocre.</p>
<p>Regarding William Wellman, we have seen many of his works, and most of them are very mature, but this film, we dare not praise.</p>
<h3>Gloria Swanson, a Female Star Who Has Been Divorced Four Times, Is About to Divorce Again</h3>
<p>— He Qin</p>
<p>Divorce is not a strange thing in Hollywood, but it is indeed rare for a male or female star to be divorced three or four times in a row. Not long ago, we heard that John Gilbert had been divorced four times. But recently, Hollywood discovered that Gloria Swanson, a female star famous for her coquettishness, is also a person who has been divorced three times. Recently, it is said that because her husband does not want her to return to the screen, she is preparing to file for divorce again. Like this taking marriage as child's play, Gilbert and she are truly a pair.</p>
<p>Her first husband was Wallace Beery, who is now very famous on the screen. The second husband was the deceased Herbert Somborn; the boss of the "Brown Derby" restaurant in Hollywood; the third was the French Marquis Henri de la Falaise; now Constance Bennett's husband. Finally, she married her current, still unseparated, fourth husband, named Michael Farmer. He is the youngest and most handsome of her four husbands, and is much younger than she is herself.</p>
<p>They first met in Europe. The two fell in love at first sight and made a pact of lifelong commitment, and she retired from the film industry. For two years, she followed her young husband back and forth between Europe and America, and they got along very well. Who knew that she recently wanted to return to the stage and reappear on the screen, but her husband was very opposed to it, so the two inevitably started to argue. A few weeks ago, Michael left Hollywood alone in a fit of pique, while Swanson still lived there, so the matter of their divorce is even more loudly discussed in Hollywood. According to Swanson herself, their divorce is probably unavoidable!</p>
<h3>The Posthumous Honor of Marie Dressler</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>When Marie Dressler was crowned Queen of Hollywood at the age of sixty, it was truly a sensation in the world's film industry. All past queens have had beautiful faces and youthful ages, but in the year that Marie Dressler became queen, she was already white-haired. She once competed with her ugly husband Wallace Beery to see who was uglier, but she occupied the queen's throne under the gaze of Hollywood stars, it was truly unprecedented in Hollywood history. At that time, the praise and public opinion were also rare in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Now, this old star has passed away, and after the news of her death spread from Hollywood, the film industry was very saddened. Many Hollywood stars sent telegrams of condolences, and the film industries of various European countries also sent telegrams to the United States to mourn. Since the founding of the United States, only Lincoln's death had such a lively atmosphere. Apart from that, no one has been able to compare.</p>
<p>Marie was born on November 9, 1871. When she celebrated her sixtieth birthday, the wife of former US President Hoover celebrated her birthday in Washington. Marie was the first to have such glory in the history of the film industry. When Marie was critically ill at the Saint Bernerd's Hospital, President Roosevelt's wife also visited in person to offer condolences. Overseas telegrams were also like snowflakes. It can be seen that Marie was respected. After her death, many of Hollywood's top stars personally went to offer condolences. It is said that after Valentino's death, there were thousands of mourners. Now Marie Dressler's funeral should be no less than that of those years.</p>
<p>One thing that can be considered a pity after Marie's death is that she had no relatives behind her. There was only a distant cousin in her home, otherwise there were none.</p>
<p>Although Marie worked a lot throughout her life and earned a lot of money, she did not have much property before her death. She was very frugal in her daily life, and did not waste all the money she had. But because she has always liked good deeds and constantly helped many poor people, all her property was used up. The poor people in the United States who had received her help could not help but cry for her this time she died.</p>
<p>Marie had made a will two weeks before her death. She instructed that all the money she had earned throughout her life should be used to help the poor, disabled, and elderly. She only asked to be buried immediately after her death, and had no other concerns. In addition, she also said that she had done many plays in the film industry, and now it was the closing of a real drama.</p>
<h3>Unfulfilled Private Wish</h3>
<p>— Lun</p>
<p>A long time ago, there was a beautiful girl who wholeheartedly wanted to become a nun. She often fantasized about becoming a nun and retreating to a convent symbolizing peace and quiet. Who was she? It was Helen Hayes.</p>
<p>However, this lovely girl did not realize her early private wish, at least she did not have the opportunity to play this role during her stage life, but in the film "White Sister," she played the role of a nun, and performed very well. To this day, this is still her most proud masterpiece.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Good Son, Good Wife (Born to be Kissed) (12)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>The prison door on Jefferson Street opened, and Tom strode in. Edie raised her haggard face, her eyes already swollen from crying, she saw Tom, and couldn't help but cheer. She hugged him and shouted, "I knew you would come, hold me tight!" Tom embraced her for a while, then let her go, looked at her face and asked, "Who exactly was that person, that you were found with?" Edie cried out in grievance, "I don't even know him! It was all a set-up by them! You have to believe me! If you don't believe me, I don't want to live anymore!" Tom hesitated for a moment, then said, "I do believe you, but who do you think set you up to frame you?" Hearing this, Edie felt warmth in her eyes, and her lips trembled. She shouted hatefully, "I know! It's none other than your father! I know it clearly, as if I heard him design and arrange it with my own ears! They accused me of stealing Kershaw's emerald... only your father knew about that, it was Kershaw who gave it to me face to face!" At this time, Pan Qi was standing outside the iron cage. He heard Edie's words, and pretended to be very kind, saying to Tom, "Son, I heard what Edie said. But her nerves are about to break down. She has suffered a lot." Edie stared at Pan Qi with both eyes and shouted, "You know! This is all your doing!" Tom persuaded, "Edie, don't be like this, Father came specially to bail you out!" Edie said, "Bail me out? I know! He's here to bail me out of your life!" She cried. Pan Qi was next to her, still pretending to be benevolent and righteous, saying, "You shouldn't have shown those two gems to people." Edie said, "Kershaw gave them to me... you know it clearly!" Pan Qi said, "Edie, if you want to say that, I can't do anything about it. But I regret keeping them for you. Being involved in this kind of case is not a good thing after all." Hearing this, Edie cursed at him, "You old hypocrite!" Tom asked doubtfully, "Why did you take those things to keep with my father?" Hearing this, Edie knew that Pan Qi had already buried suspicion and disbelief in his son's heart, and shouted like crazy, "Why? It's because I was afraid that the police wouldn't believe me, so I asked him for help!" Tom said, "Didn't Father also give you money to go to another place?" Edie said, "Is that what he told you? That money was lent to me by him... but he didn't say anything about going to another place. I haven't committed any crime, why should I run away?" Tom said: "But you did go out..." Pan Qi said again, "What are you to Kershaw, tell Tom." Edie said, "I'm nothing to him. He is also nothing to me. That night, it was the first time I met him. This is all the truth, Tom." She looked at Tom with tear-filled eyes, pleadingly. Tom said, "Didn't you say that he was willing to marry you... and you were already engaged?" Edie said, "I... he did ask me to marry him, but maybe he was deliberately fooling me..." Pan Qi interjected, "What do you mean? Wasn't he about to commit suicide?" Edie was even more aware of Pan Qi's cunning by his interruption, and couldn't help but curse loudly again, "You old thing who tells lies and plots to harm people!" She was extremely disappointed, knowing that she could not fight against the old diplomat who was deep in thought. Pan Qi then turned to his son and said, "Son, she has almost answered all the questions. Tom looked at his father inexplicably, and then looked at Edie. (To be continued)</p>
