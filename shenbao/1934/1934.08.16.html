<p>時評</p>
<h3>論現行之中等教育制度廷</h3>
<p>本報近載教部某重要人員之負責談話。關於最近中等教育之新設施。頗有所説明。計其談話中心。凡分三點。一爲中等教育制度問題。二爲中等教育經費支配問題。三爲普通中學畢業會考問題。吾人猶憶二十年冬。國聨教育調查團來華調查後。批評中國教育之缺點。頗中肯要。而於中國中等教育之指摘。更足發人深省。因亦深切感覺中等教育確有改革之必要。然於研究之餘。則發覺其所見不盡與教部某君相同。顧以篇幅所限。不克畢傾其説。因先爲現行制度之商榷焉。　　現行中等教育制度。乃一中學師範職業學校三者鼎立之制度也。吾人欲批評此制内容之失當。應先略知前制之梗槪。按自民元鼎革以來。我國教育制度之更改。不可勝數。民國十七年五月第一次全國教育會議議决學校系統圖及其説明。同年。并頒布中學暫行條例。二者皆規定初級中學得視地方之需要。兼設各種職業科。高級中學亦得分普通及農工商家事。師範等職業科。至十九年四月之和二次全國教育會議。對於二年前之規定。不惟未作改絃更張之舉。且對職業科高中之設置。特别注意。在第一第二兩次全國教育會議之舉行期間。相隔殆不下二年之久。如照教部某君所言。謂當時所實行之中學師範職業合併設立制度。足使各種教育之設施混淆。目的紛歧。何以出席會議之若許教育專家見不及此。而必欲將錯就錯。一誤再誤。吾人須知民十七之制度。並强令中學師範職業三者非合併設立不可。觀其特准農。工商師範等科得單獨設立爲高級職業學校。用意尤爲明顯。而况一中等教育制度。果能融冶三者之優長於一爐。配置適當。運用得法。證諸列强中等教育之現勢。亦確有使學生通轉較易。適於發展個性之優點。則縱然澈底實行。亦何所傷乎。現制將普通中學師範學校職業學校各個分開。單獨設立。蓋與日本在昭和元年（民國十五年）時之中學制度相雷同。而彼邦教育學者如吉水松巖者且力加抨擊矣。吉水氏之意。以爲（把普通中學與職業學校兩者完全看爲異性質的東西。…實在已不能適合於時代所要求。不過只是一種離開現實生活的無内容的觀念而已。）故竭力主張中學採取職業學校之要素。職業學校攝收中學之特長。（見原著日本中等學校改造論）氏又指出德國韋瑪憲法中規定（公立學校之構成。應以適應各種職業之需要爲標準。）而美國之中等學校亦有由一般的人格教育而漸變爲職業教育之傾向。卽日本文部省鑒於國内外之趨勢。亦卒於昭和六年（民國二十年）一月間修正中學校規程。對於中學教育實行職業。化凡五年中學。自三年或四年起。便分成二部。一部升學。一部不升學。不升學一部。或農或工或商。固儼然與職校無異。卽升學一部。仍復有職業課程之設。用以養成國民勤勞習慣。生産知能。以爲一般青年卽能升入大學。攻讀文科。亦應使其雙手得相當之訓練也。然則以中學校爲純粹高等教育之準備機關。而使多數以中等教育爲最終教育之學生。不能乘機獲得其實際生活之知能。其爲不合潮流之主張。亦從可知矣。凡此皆足反證。今日三分中等教育制度而以升學爲普通中學教育之唯一目的之措置。實爲錯誤。今姑退一步舍理論而觀現實。以吾國辦理良好之大學及專科之缺乏。一方面旣欲求全國大學及專科學校招生之嚴格。而他方面復以會考制度剝奪一部分高中畢業生參與升學試騐之機會。結果必有不少之高中畢業生。半途輟學。而使其往昔所學之知識。太半擲於虚牝足見教部某君以普通中學（爲研究高深學術之階梯）之理想。充其量亦不過能爲部分之實現而已。而况學生因本身興趣之變遷。或家庭境遇之壓迫。不克升入大學者。亦往往而有。政府旣非萬能。焉能担保中學學生之必能繼續修業以至於畢業畢業。後必能升學而又必願升學耶。然則現制不如前制之（縱横活動。）固無疑也。謂余不信。試觀本年六月一日。江蘇省立中等學校教職員聨合會舉行教訓會議。有下列之决議二項。則益可恍然矣。　　（一）高初中及各種職業學校學生。有因環境或志趣改變。有志願升學及服務者。應如何補救案。（决議）一，初中現在之一年級。應酌設職業方面之選科。以便學生就學。二、現在高中及職業學校一二年級。應酌設選科以應需要。三、請教師設立補習學校。以資補救。　　（二）二十三年起。省校推廣生産教育。緊縮普通中學及師範科班級。而職業科各校。并不招收學生。但初中學生畢業者日多。升學困難。可否由會呈請教廳指定原有學校。加添職業訓練班。或各職業學校男女兼收。免致學生向隅案。（决議）通過。　　新制甫自二十一年起實行。而要求補救之聲浪。已交接於吾人之耳鼓。觀此要求。直與教部期望適相反背。然迫於時勢。又焉得謂其非正當耶。推教部之意。或將云。此爲過渡期間之現象。不足過慮。一俟職業學校與師範學校相當擴充。普通中學嚴格限制之後。凡志趣偏向於師範或職業科之學生。可不致再如今日麕集於普通中學之一途矣。但不知擴充職業師範。縮减中學之舉。在事實上固多窒塞。而欲十二三齡之小學畢業生。當其預備升入中等學校之際。確定其個性之興趣。以爲升學之標準。其困難尤爲意想所可及也。此雖賢父兄仁師長。亦將無所致其忠告。矧政府乎。至於學生因環境之變化而變易初衷者。更不待論矣。可見此爲一永久性質之難題。而非僅爲過渡時期之現象也。現制之不如前制。於此可見一斑教部某君批評前制。實非制度本身之過。而推行未盡得法之過也。且過去中等學校之未行前制者。比比皆是。將整個的中等教育之失敗。諉之於前制之錯誤。亦未見其允當也。</p>

<h3>爲工商界及社會人士</h3>
<p>進一言鄭　斌近十餘年來。我國工商業日益增進。上海一隅。工廠林立。商務繁興。進步之速。一日千里。然現今世界不景氣之時。百業凋零。工業則供過於求。商業則營業衰落。遂各自爲謀。以圖振作。種種方式。層出不窮。如大減價。贈品。抽奬。及大登廣告。互相競爭。以爲營業推銷之助。其法同善。惟未免過於繁俗。聨合贈品公司。於此時鑒運而興。實爲各工商業推廣營業之導師。歐美各國。對於此種贈品券。行之已久。獲果甚佳。今聨合贈品公司。仿而行之。對於廠商零售　及人羣。裨益甚多。爲廠商興零售商者。採用聨合贈品劵。固足以推銷其貨品而增進其營業。得此贈品券者。亦可隨時掉換所需之贈品。利便非常。且聨合贈品公司。所備之贈品。多爲全國名廠出品。搜羅美備。宣傳之力旣宏。推銷之功亦大。故廠商之出品。得經搜羅。自可不脛而走。因是採用聨合贈品券者。直接固足以助長其營業。間接亦足推銷國貨。有百利而無一弊。深望各業商行。愛國熱心士女。對於聨合贈品券。加特别之注意。庶幾國貨得以振興。請條市面。得轉爲繁榮也。</p>
<h3>聨合贈品之起源與現况</h3>
<p>陸梅憎時無論今古。地無論中外。同是圓頂。同是方趾。未有不貪圖便利者。國家卽利用此心理。設爲廉價贈品諸法。以圖招徠顧客。謀營業之發展。試觀我國舊時商店。開張必舉行廉價。或寛放貨量。或低減價值。予顧客以優待。希其源源惠顧。近來復以買一送一。足尺加三諸法相號召。無非使來者滿意。發生好感。俾交易可以永久繼續。商戰日烈。競爭方法。層出不窮。更有所謂贈品之法。卽於商品以外。附送零星貨品。以博顧客歡心。遠考歐美情形。亦復相同。如麵包肆之以十三件爲一打。及加洋一分可得兩件貨品等。均屬招徠之普通方法。歷久相沿。確於營業之保持與推廣。具有相當效力。　　嗣以人事演進。爲適應各時期需要計。爰創隨貨贈品新法。復經逐漸改良。迄今成爲普遍通行之法。店無大小。無不樂於採用。視爲貨品廣告有直接之效力。美國全年贈品數值達三萬萬美金之鉅。此外英德澳諸國亦多盛行。英國最著名之某大報。利用贈品。增加銷路。竟達二百萬日銷類。可見贈品之能引起顧客興趣。推廣商家營業矣。以上僅就單獨贈品而言。　　顧猶不無缺點。蓋所贈之物。未必盡屬顧客之需要。而商家印券換物。費用手續。亦未免勞費。二十年前美國創立聨合互利公司。專爲工商界服務。以代印券。代換贈品爲業務。規模宏大。成效顯著。嗣又有司不來赫金公司繼起。發行綠色贈品券。採用者羣稱便利。蓋商家於費用手續方面。均可節省。而顧客集券。旣極便利。選換贈品。亦甚自由。是以風行一時。羣稱無上良法焉。　　邇者國内經濟衰落。百業不振。苟非另闢途徑。實不足以解决商家銷貨問題。引起顧客購買興趣。爰援用歐美方法。參酌社會情形。徴集同志。創設聨合贈品股份有限公司於上海。人才組織。務與歐美相伯仲。以服務大衆爲主旨。以謀産銷兩利爲前提。我國工商前途。庶幾蒸蒸日上矣。</p>

<h3>聨合贈品大衆有益松</h3>
<p>聨合贈品股份有限公司所定之聨合贈品辦法。在歐美各國。早已風行一時。并且頗有成效。在我國則係破天荒。鄙人蒙各股東之　奬。推爲監察之一。自問才不勝任。因固辭不獲。不得不勉隨諸君之後。努力服務。冀減愆尤。鄙意該公司爲我國首創産銷服務機關。於商家顧客方面。均有利益。故樂予提倡。蓋贈品二字。早爲市場上所採用。而以上海爲尤甚。不過市上所用之贈品辦法。係單獨的。與聨合之情形不同。單獨則花式限於一業而不完備。聨合則集數百家之多。物旣各異。式亦不同。例如於一店内選擇貨品。容有不能適合己意之處。若集數百種貨品於一堂而選擇一二。則必能滿意。且獨贈）券。苟值大洋一角或五分。倘所獲者距掉換處相去甚遠。如欲前往掉換。則車費較券價格反大。得不償失。遂棄而不用。則得如不得。現在聨合舉辦。集合各處所得之贈品券。可以不問何家所贈。祗須計算券數。卽可持至掉換處掉換。省去時間與經濟不少。商家方面。單獨舉行。贈品力量有限。且印刷費亦着實可觀。紙張考究。則費大。印刷組率則不特不美觀。使人厭惡。且易發生假冒。反爲受虧。以上海而論。寸金田地。一屋有一屋之用場。斷不能終年專指定一屋以儲藏此種贈品券。該公司所定之辦法。手續簡便。且可省費。收效甚宏。足以保持固有營業。推廣未來銷路。一舉而數善備。希望各商家。酌量情形。採用此法。以嘗試之。且從平地起樓産生面選看别樣開鐵網珊瑚供採擇多情應勝一枝梅　　戰略推陳又出新主持貨殖要精神五都市上歡雙起共作分曹射覆人鄭　南</p>
<h3>聨合贈品券與推銷商品</h3>
<p>的關係姚君偉　　現時工商業的不景氣，委實是無可緯言，我們反覆攷求這不景氣的原因，雖訊是世界經濟衰落所影響，人們購賣力的薄弱，可是宣傳方法的不甚適當，推銷策略的不新奇化，未始非一個缺漏罷！　　事實顯明的昭示着，很有許多優良的商品，因爲不去運用廣告的宣傳和推銷方法的改善，所以往往是宣告失敗了，近來漸始感覺得重要，大家十分注意，而且互相戰爭起來，於是有許多商店，爲求要激起購買者動力，迎合着一般人們的心理，採用趕贈品的辦法來，如最近市上新出多種香烟盛行贈品方法，我們就知道，在這社會潮流大衆需求情形之下，要擴展他所經營的工商業，非　　聨合赠品公司特刊通流無滯徐佩璜題　　聨合贈品股份有限公司特刊紀念利民惠商　　唐寳士題從運合顧主的心理着想，不能夠激起購買的勸作，贈品之法可説是推銷策略中之妙法，可是單獨舉行所規定的贈品，旣不能普通適合各個人的需要，同時時間短促，地域限定了一兩，力量因之也薄弱，而在商店一方面，爲了要舉行贈品，其勢必須另設部份，專漲職司，印贈券訂辦法等，手續上十分繁宂，開支浩大，如此不能不打算一下。現在聨合贈品公司，應進而産生了，他們實行代理産銷雙方來服務，根據歐美早經盛行，且已收效的成法，詳察圖内的宣隊情形，籌劃經年，組織完善，在在可稱得無美不備，所發行的贈品券，聨合了全圖製造家和零售商來使用，更常有巨幅新奇奪目的廣告，擴大宣傳，以及精美贈品目錄和常年陳設的贈品櫉窗，作强有力的後盾，所以效力宏大，無論已經行銷或新出的商品，都應用聨合贈品券來輔助推銷，可以把握得到十分美滿的成功，任何商品，利用聨合贈品券來號召，一定獲得偉大久遠的實效，道是無疑義的。　　我們可以從聨合贈品券的本身所發揮的功能，以及大衆所希望收得聨合贈品券的原因，就可以證實了。例如：　　聨合贈品券，無論何時何地，都可任意運用；　　聨合贈品券，不問何處得來，都能合併有效；　　聨合贈品券，採用商家旣多，得券十分容易；　　聨合贈品券，辦法新奇，能引起積聚興味；　　聨合贈品券，銷行廣違號召能力永久偉大；　　聨合贈品券，使用手續簡妥信用可靠。根據這幾點來説，可以斷定今後羣衆如操購貨物，必選擇附有聨合贈品券的商品，而使能積少成多。掉換心愛合意的贈品，無形中附有聨合贈品券的商品，必能深印入人們腦海，常樂請用的決心，而在贈送此項聨合贈券的商店，將券隨貨贈出之後，卽無應過問一切，由聨合贈品公司實行代理服務了，在這賣買雙力，互惠條件下。誰又何樂不爲呢？那末聨合贈品券的行世，實爲整個商市闢一推銷商品的新途徑，望着全國的工商界，明瞭了聨合贈品券與自身，實有深切關係，盡量地愛護這萌芽初創的新事業！</p>
<h3>如何使買客滿意陸守倫</h3>
<p>如何使買客滿盤。爲近世業商者焦心思慮之一點。因是，一方努力於出品之改進，一方注意於推銷計劃之革新。設徒事側重於改進生産，而忽於推銷方法，猶請明球棄櫝，祗能自己知其滿意，而不能使買客知所滿意。故改良出品與推銷計劃，如舟之與詫，不可或離。　　推銷方法，重爲繁夥，不得其道，必致事倍功半，是以精明幹練之推銷人員，僅播少許之種子，卽能得大量之收穫，而比種收穫，又極永久，决非與奮一時者所能同日語。是以推銷一部，在每一商　中，與製造　於同一之重要地位。贈品爲增進購力之原子量，爲現代推銷出品之生力單，因是推銷人員對於贈品之採用，亦極盡勾心鬥角之能事；雖能提起買客之興趣，但贈品種類有限，未必能博得每個買客之滿意，此仍爲美中不足，未免抱撼！　　自聨合贈品方法盛行歐美後，每一加入之商品，均得有相當之效果，較請單獨致贈，勝　百倍，縱其優點：　　（一）贈品數量豐富，可以儘量選擇，不若規定者之有限制，强人所不願得者而强予之；方法活動，歡迎者多。　　（二）贈品旣得選擇，於是掉換贈品之券，必須適如其規定之數量，如急於得某種贈品，所有之券倘不足數，勢必致向加入聨合贈品之商　購取貨物，以凑滿其量。　　（三）贈品券取　簡便，珍藏又易，卽以之餽贈視友，較請禮券亦無多讓。買客爲商肄業命之源，故商肆對買客當易地而處，細心體會入買客之心理，然後商肆本身之業務，得以隨之推進。聨合贈品旣爲買客所歡迎，則加入聨合贈品之商肆，獲益當更無渥涘。　　聨合贈品在中國僅屬首創，志在服務，他非所計，無非使幾　絶境之中國商業，謀一新興開展之途。　　聨合贈品公司貸行特刊紀念聨絡産銷二方為發展實業之要圖李延安題通商惠工陳介敏題省費之間社会人士利益無窮</p>

<h3>論作品的内容</h3>
<p>－答李求是君－　　李求是君來信説：（我也曾看過一些文藝理論書，知道一篇作品的好壞，主要地决定於它的内容，没有内容的作品，即使描寫得如何細膩，也是等於浮雕，是不能成爲一篇佳作的，最近看到現代七月號文藝獨白内蘇汶先生的那篇（没有内容）的短文，倒又使我糢糊起來了。蘇先生反對批評家們拿（没有内容）這句話來批評别人的作品，他以爲（内容是包含了主題和材料），一篇作品，（没有主題，也没有人物背景，以致故事的進行，那我們可以説它（没有）内容），但這種作品，一似乎還没有在中國出現；即使有，也到差不多等於没有。這是不是對的呢？如果照蘇先生的話，作品中的所謂内容，就完全不成其爲問題了。我懷疑，敢請先生們給我一個明確的解釋。）　　我們接讀李君來信後，認爲首先要向李君解釋的，是對於（内容）這個名詞，即所謂内容是不是僅包含着主題和材料，或者還是另外别的什麽。（未完）</p>

<p>十比八五比七因天黑和局而散　　鄭兆佳戰勝小寺七比五六比二　　邱梁勝吉田小寺六比三六比二上海草地網球會邀請之滿洲國日本太田選手等一行、昨在星加坡路中國網球會作在滬最後一次比賽、除太田對林寳華之單打、各勝一盤、以天黑未了外、餘又全軍覆没、邱飛海梁德光之雙打、輕描淡寫、以六比三、六比二、勝小寺與吉田、鄭兆佳奮發有爲、以七比五、六比二克小寺、昨日觀者仍極踴躍、約有五六百人、總計此次太田網球隊之在滬、除在法商總會太田勝林寳華外、餘則全敗、各選手之技術、實平常之極、▲邱梁勝小寺吉田</p>
<h3>邱飛海穏健持重</h3>
<p>開幕第一塲、爲邱飛海梁德光對太田與小寺之雙打、但太田爲養蓄精鋭、凖備與林寳華比賽乃改由吉田對小寺出塲、技殊平平、邱飛海穏健持重、球無虚發、梁德光隨來隨去、恰到妙境、表演頗爲滿意、開賽後、邱梁連取二局、即成三比一、而三比二、邱之高壓及一次網前之輕球、博得掌聲不少、但在九次等分以後、卒仍敗北、乃成三比三、此後邱梁一路順風、以六比三勝、</p>
<h3>日選手一籌莫展</h3>
<p>第二盤起日選手愈形不支、梁德光取得發球展、小寺以發球之忽然得手而勝、又各加一局、二比二後、邱梁網前攔殺、左右逢源、使小寺吉田疲於奔命、招架無策、更以頻頻送球入網、邱梁遂又以六比二勝、甚爲容易、鄭兆佳擊敗小寺</p>
<h3>兆佳膽小幾誤事</h3>
<p>雙打旣畢、鄭兆佳與小寺續作單打比賽、鄭有特殊美妙之表演、博得觀衆之好評、但開首仍患膽怯之病、一再送球入網或出界、連失兩局、鄭力事振作、小心應戰、抽球漸有把握、二比二後、以滑四奪回小寺之發球局、反以三比二佔先、但鄭以迭出發球雙失誤、失去第六局、成三比三、小寺再加二局、以五比三居鄭之上、小鄭岌岌可危矣</p>
<h3>顯鋒芒連勝四局</h3>
<p>但鄭於此時、突然振作、雄心勃勃、精神抖擻、奪回小寺之發球局後、以左右對角之猛抽、造成五比五平手、雙方各小心爭以後之最先着但小寺以一次發球雙失誤及一次觸網球鄭遂以六比五導前、遂加足勁道、恢復其砲彈式之發球、鋭急之對角掃射、乘機上網、得心應手、卒以七比五勝、</p>
<h3>小寺如强弩之末</h3>
<p>鄭已至全盛時代、使小寺無所用其極、第二盤鋒芒益盛、小寺奔走不遑、疲於應付頃刻連負三局、第四局鄭有更美麗之抽球、但竟失是局、以下兩局、均爲鄭勝、一局爲滑四、但小寺亦以滑四還報一局、結果成六比二、又歸鄭勝▲林寳華太田和局</p>
<h3>二人球藝之評價</h3>
<p>第一次賽林寳華以七比九、四比六、敗於太田後、邱飛海則以六比四、六比二、戰勝太田、林爲圖報復起見、昨特約太田再戰、結果林以十比八勝首盤、太田以七比五勝次盤、因天黑未能决最後之雌雄、觀太田之技、全在於熟、並無特殊之點林寳華則以火氣太盛、失誤疊出、抽球雖勁、但無太田穏健、在不可冒險殺球之時、亦一再冒險力抽、結果圖費氣力、於事無補、故林之所以不易勝太田也、</p>
<h3>太田雄圖復令譽</h3>
<p>太田選手鑒於全隊人員之全軍覆没、不得不力謀振作、以冀恢復令譽於萬一、而林寳華則爲報復前恨起見、亦加足氣力對抗、是以戰來較前益爲劇烈、卒以林之自殺太多、以可勝之盤、造成相持不下之勢、十比八、吃力非凡、開始、林輒上網、功過互見、三比三後、二人經長時間之劇戰、林連獲二局、以五比三領前不料林求勝心切、操之過急、反失三局、屈居下風、林再試上網、果然成功、於是七比六、又居前茅、太田亦不示弱、發憤猛抽、連以滑四得兩局、林亦以滑四勝發球局、八比八、旋成九比八、林又得機會、最後太田一次觸網、一次困於林之猛力發球、結果遂歸林以十比八勝、</p>
<h3>林寳華冒險失策</h3>
<p>第二盤中、林固又有極可勝之機會、惜無爲冒險、徒遭自殺、二人以觸網彈過而勝之球甚多、最初四局中、各勝發球局、三比二後、太田以攻破林之發球局、遂佔優勢、林以滑四造成四比四後、又犯性急之病、頻頻送球出界、四比五、而五比五、林終以五比七敗北、時天色已黑、不能作最後决賽、乃和局而終、全國體恊會</p>

<h3>參加人員</h3>
<p>計吳市長代表章秘書、市教育局潘局長陳科長·謝督學·交通大學黎校長、大同大學曹校長、曁講習班教員表維裕·徐名材·胡敦復·顧澄·關實之·陳國傑·及數學組學員金杭風·戴玉衡·黄錫祺等、物理組學員劉崇禮等、化學組學員范盧舟等生物組學員張維新等共一百五十餘人、</p>

<h3>市長訓詞</h3>
<p>市府秘書章淵若代表吳市長訓詞略謂、目前中國教育精神、實有澈底改造之必要、個人曾爲文主張提倡實科教育、政府現已逐漸注重於生産教育、中校理科教員暑期講習班之舉辦、亦即證明教育之趨向、已向實科方面走去、我們知道文化不是空的東西、是實際的東西、人類利用智識能力對自然及物質做創造及利用工作、在工作中找出解决人類生活、民族生存的即是文化工作、教育亦不過是推動文化、故離開了創造或利用物質及自然、文化就没有價值、教育推開了推動民族文化、其結果也是徒然的證之歷史、三皇五帝、及先師孔子、也以自然科學實際去工作、才得人民的推重、惟後世漸漸埋没、遂致中國文化一天天衰落、故今後做文化教育工作一定要有研究實科的精神云、</p>
<h3>局長訓詢</h3>
<p>次潘局長訓詞略謂、普通人誤會文化是文學一類的東西、故偏重到文科而把實科方面的事情忘記了、其實文化也不是實科可以包括的、是包含兩方面的、但我們現在要轉移社會風氣、使大家注重到實科、就要從這方面努力、在中等學校担任理科教員的、尤其要負起責任來、中學生對於理科不感興趣、即證明中國文化經過幾千年、側重於講道使現在的表示、還没有訓練到有自然科學的興趣、如新文化運動一樣、其範圍弄到太狹、變成文字上之爭執、從前有文言文與白話文之爭、現在又有白話文與大衆語之爭、我們要復興民族文化、建設新文化、各位要絶對避免此種文字上之爭執、要研究理科的人能努力於文化運動、然後中國新文化才可以建設云、末由交大黎校長、大同曹校長、來賓顧澄等致詞、學員戴玉衡答詞、至十二時許禮成、攝影而散、本市</p>

<h3>苗中風土記（一）</h3>
<p>— 覺</p>
<p>湖南貴州四川，三省交界之處，自古居有苗民的性情風俗，實與漢人逈殊，因其居於山寨，岡巒沓互，溪澗深阻，故吾漢人，足跡罕至，遂於苗中風土，無能知其詳者，余有友人，供職黔中，足跡所至，遍於三省歷年旣久，習於苗事，詳述苗中風土，屬余爲文記之，亦使留心世事者，得知苗中梗槪云。</p>
<p>苗疆邊墻舊址，自亭子關起，東北繞浪中江，至盛華哨過長坪，轉北面牛岩蘆塘，至高樓哨得勝營，再北至木林灣溪，繞乾城鎭溪，又西北至良章營喜鵑營止，苗民之居於邊墻以外者爲生苗，居於邊墻以内者爲熟苗，間與民村相錯居住·或佃耕民田，供賦當差，實與内地人民，不相異也。</p>
<p>臘耳山，介楚黔之間，分隸於貴州鎭遠道屬之省溪松桃縣者，稱爲黔苗，分隸於湖南辰沅道屬之鳳凰乾城永綏等縣者，稱爲楚苗，而黔苗與楚苗之性情風俗，則實無甚區别也。</p>
<p>苗民之居於湖南鳳凰乾城永綏三縣者，統分十里，上六里稱爲紅苗，下四里稱爲雷苗，故永綏一縣，統爲六里紅苗，而縣西黄瓜寨一帶，縣南鴉酉栗林各寨，土人則指爲黑苗，至縣北坪茶洞臘耳堡與保靖及四川東川道屬之秀山縣接界處，則黑苗而兼土蠻也。</p>
<p>紅苗寨多人繁，爲諸部所畏，而黑苗之地陰氣悍，足與頡頑，一言以蔽之，紅苗衆於黑苗，黑苗兇於紅苗，故自古以來，苗民之聚衆滋事者，率爲黑苗也。</p>
<p>生苗各分寨落，在貴州松桃縣，及湖南鳳凰乾城永綏等縣交界處者，地勢毘連，犬牙相錯，有部落，無酋長，其俗不以人命爲重，寨中有父子兄弟數人，或數十人强梁健鬭者，則寨中畏之，共推爲猷長，如寨中再有此一户一人，則又各自爲黨，故一寨一長，或一寨數長，皆以盛衰强弱，遞變更易，不如他部之有酋長，世受統豁也。</p>
<p>苗民姓吳龍石麻寥五姓者爲眞苗，其楊施彭張洪諸姓，乃外民人贅，習得其俗，遂成族類也。</p>
<p>苗民命名，男子多以老，如老偶老補老彼老罷老鐵老喬老傘老叟老宰之類，女子多以阿　如阿叟阿中阿怕阿妹阿吉阿金阿息阿布之類。</p>
<p>苗民民不知文字，父子遞傳，以鼠牛虎馬記年月，然亦暗與歷書相合，性善記，懼有忘，則結於繩爲契劵，刻於木爲符信，蓋太古之風，猶存於今日苗中也。近日苗民亦有知命童子，日負雜粳數升，就漢人授句讀，其中聰俊者，亦能通曉文義云。</p>
<p>苗民依山結爲茅屋而居，亦有造爲瓦屋者，但無層次定向，亦無窗牖。</p>
<p>墻垣，每屋三五間，每間五六柱，簷户低小，右設一榻，高四五尺中設火爐，炊爨坐臥其上，名曰火床，翁姑子婦兄弟妯娌，羣處無避，惟夫婦同被，女長則别設一牀於右，客民宿其家，任其雜處不怪，牛馬鷄犬之屬，皆居其下，莫知其穢，而苗人居無常處，蓋室經死人，即遷而之他也。</p>
<h3>新建置不久成古蹟</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>戚飯午先生近彚印小品文字，爲小叢書，卷一牧牛庵筆記，有記周氏寫經幢一則云：（金匱周梅谷手寫金剛經五千言，刻石立幢於虎阜山麓。）但是我們現在到虎邱去，再也找不到這經幢了。原來這經幢立在千人石上，把一塊太古天眞的石坡，硬生生鑿了一個窟窿，眞合着蘇州人的俗語（好肉上生瘡）。當時也只少數人知道，後來巍然成立，大家就深爲詫異，以爲千人石是古蹟，不應破壞他。並且周氏的經幢，是壽他的母，私德無關宏指。便由故時人陳佩忍等，以古物保管會名義，把經幢毁去。可是千人石上的窟窿，依然存在，就是澆了水門汀，也不能泯然無跡了。一個新建置，經過不到一年，就成了古蹟，也是有趣的事。</p>
<p>就是程雪樓把鳳池庵改建擴大而成的植園，也没有幾年，就荒廢零落，一部分給省立中學圈了去，闢爲校園，一部分任他庭花自落，當時也有幾間茅屋，可資小坐，至今一無所有了。我們偶然從園外經過，還能望見裏面落葉成陰，横枝如織，可是能够指點而説（這是植園啊）也没有多人了，差不多也成了古蹟了。　　現在有人想把孔廟植園一帶，整理起來，或者闢爲公園，或者建設學校，倒是狠有意思的。本來這一個區域太荒蕪了，遠遠還立着一座面目狰獰的瑞光塔，形成一種陰森似的鬼墟景象，更使（冷水盤門）不能增加熱度。我希望蘇州人努力！</p>
<h3>跳舞潮</h3>
<p>— 紅蕚</p>
<p>邇來上海最摩登之消遣，厥惟跳舞，當此酷暑，尤盛行露天舞塲。蓋專閫美姬，名門淑媛，每當夜午，小睡初醒，新浴乍罷，則披霧榖，馳摩託，風馳電掣而戾西郊。至則萬花如海，絃管沸春，於微風淡蕩之中，作天女婆娑之舞，玉骨氷肌，清凉無汗，倦則或啜小食，或進冷飲，驅電轂，繞道北新涇徐家匯而返。維時已晨光喜微，曉風拂面，乃展桃笙，鋪氷簟，邯鄲一枕，寗復知東方之已白，此則資産階級，逭暑有方，固不必遠走匡廬青島也。</p>
<p>在昔徜徉舞塲者，以佻㒓少年爲多，自黨國要人，休沐來滬，輒以涉足舞塲爲樂，於是商塲健將，在野名流，效而尤之，視跳舞爲舒筋骨，習儀節之高尚娛樂，舞塲之營業，乃歷久不敝。蓬門弱質，爭習舞藝，博升斗之需，其能者月入在半竿以上，不特一家衣食。賴以無虞，甚者且起居埒於王侯，居必洋樓，出必摩託，遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女，生女可作伴舞娘，勝彼年年壓金錢者萬萬。社會潮流，如疾風偃草，可不畏哉！</p>
<p>因跳舞盛行，於是梅花團新華團應運而生，一元大武之座價，居然滿坑滿谷，共舞臺近排演張恂子著之紅羊豪俠傳，跳舞時間佔五分之一，舞藝係黎錦暉之嫡傳，舞衣一襲之代價，在三十金以上，多財善賈，遂令格花新華，六宮粉黛無顔色，亦可謂善於投機者矣。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>可是這頭犬的模樣兒，却和海獺倒有些相像，大槪太后覺得海獺這兩個字，尚不十分受聽，因此改用了一個（龍）字。這條犬是眞正的北京種，全身的毛片，作深椶色，但在頸部和頭部上，却披着一大簇白得像銀子一樣的長毛，彷彿是老年人的頭髮。它的身子很短，很小，腿短而屈，很像一張弓的弓背，鼻子扃得和削平的一樣，而兩個眼睛，却特别的大，我可以説是從没有見過這樣大眼睛的狗。憑着它這樣希奇古怪的相貌，推測，大槪在北京的許多狗裏頭，它必然是屬於最優良的一種：所以太后對於這一頭小小的畜生，眞是十二分的歡喜，甚至可以説是十二分的愛慕。每天晚上，伊一定要它躺在那座小朝廷裏。但它旣是一條皇太后所寵愛的犬，就是躺，也不能像尋常人家的犬一樣的隨便躺在地上，它有一個竹筐，作爲臥榻。這個竹筐是很大的，可以裝得下一個小孩子，而且裏面還用極好看的紅緞襯着，不知底細的人見了，再也想不到這是給狗躺的東西。但它還不止這樣闊綽咧，太后並特地指定一個太監，教他日夜負責侍候這條福祿雙全的小犬。它當然也有衣服，那是一件像馬身上披的馬鎧一樣的甲，面子是紅色的貢緞，夾裏是一種最柔軟的皮革。在它的頭頸裏，還有三個金鈴繫着，兩邊兩個比較小一些，中間一個特别的大：只要他隨便走走，跑跑，跳跳，它自己的身上，便會奏出一種簡單的音樂來。在它頸部所圍的一條領圈的後面，恰巧貼近它的耳朶的地方，有兩個像兵士們裝在軍帽上的帽章一樣的東西點綴着，都是用絲線做的，一紅一綠，着實好看；待到顔色一舊，便立卽更換，所以永遠是非常鮮艷奪目的。不過有一點，未免美中不足：就是這條狗的享受無論怎樣舒服，但也免不掉要拴上一根皮帶，使它的行動，永遠不得自由。（一○六）</p>
<h3>胡博士的鴨子</h3>
<p>— （陳退甘）</p>
<p>胡適之博士，月前購得一鴨，扁嘴短足，羽毛平貼，每晨放之庭院中，飼以榖物，博士顧而樂之。詎意鴨子恃寵而驕，某日忽踱至胡夫人房中，大撒其屎，胡夫人大怒，立命庖人縛而宰之。胡博士不忍，百般解説，爲鴨子求情，夫人不允，雙方爭執不决。適清華大學教授劉叔雅君馳至，聞悉其詳，乃作一和事老，乞得鴨子而歸。至今此鴨尚留養劉教授寓中，或詢以何故獨養一鴨。劉君即舉其事以告，聞者莫不忍俊不禁云。</p>
<h3>國力充實民族復興以後</h3>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>跳舞話</h3>
<p>— 金諤儒</p>
<p>跳舞的源流，不但歷史悠久，而且無論那一種民族，都有他原始的跳舞，上古的民族伏居於山麓森林的時代，便有雛形的跳舞，不過那時的跳舞，是像猿猴的欣騰鼓舞，手擊足蹈，躍身而鳴，以表示内心的快感了吧。</p>
<p>攷其最顯著的舞：（一）以埃及的死舞爲最古，這種跳舞於人死時候用的。（二）非洲的黑人和爪哇的土番生涯，他們每天的生活可以説是不能離開歌舞，每日銷膺他們的光陰。（三）希臘人跳舞，完全是由美術脱胎出來的。（四）羅馬的跳舞，其步伐的種種式樣可從書本裏覓得。其他繼起的，有法蘭西意大利的宮庭劇舞和德國舞；文藝復興時代又産生了新的跳舞，至今還有他們的痕跡，以後到了十八世紀發生了華爾采園舞和斯拉夫族的國民舞，到了十九世界，就有和美怒愛舞，如福堆舞，來有因輪舞，拍爾客舞，鐵羅哩舞，直到二十世紀才輸入了英美式的跳舞，呌做步舞，後來又有波士登圍舞，以代舊時的華爾采圍舞，還有所謂二步舞，一步舞等等的名詞。</p>
<p>中國的毛詩大序上説：（在心爲志，發言爲詩，情動於中，面形於言，言之不足，故不知手之無之，足之蹈之。）這更可見跳舞一道，晋賢已先有洞澈的見解，而不敢非議的了，况且今日有音樂節調，有光綫的配合，但音樂的創造，多數人也相信是導源於跳舞，即文化呢？又何嘗不是由跳舞的發源。</p>
<p>本來跳舞在人生的效用上，是能表露美的形態，並且能使一個呆板的人生，薰陶成爲一個活潑而有曲綫美的恣態，能使人類變爲眞美善的動物。進一步説，跳舞是一種最高尚的藝術，不但不會墮人的志願，還會添助人生的樂觀和青年奮發有爲的精神。</p>
<p>我們人類從旭日東升，一直到金烏西墜，終日忙碌於工作，勞心費力，精神一定會感到疲乏，在工作完畢，利用餘聞的時間去尋求一種有益身心的娛樂，恢復疲勞的精，調劑枯燥的生活，也是人生必要的需求。</p>
<p>最近幾年來，我國各大都市的跳舞，像雨後春筍的篷篷勃勃，一般的摩登青年男女們，多像如醉如狂的，沉迷在跳舞廳裏，豪情雅興，無論比那一種工作來得有勁，國難當前，是不是這就是所謂救國的工作麽？</p>
<p>就是那些蒼頭白髮的先生，或老太太，也是現身於五色的電炬中，在這一般思想較爲陳舊的人們看來，或許也會批評他們，譏誚他們，但這批評，和譏笑，是不是正確？那是還須以我國青年的人格公評的，由物質條件的改進，和個人主義的放縱，生活的藝術化，已成爲今日人類的一致要求。跳舞已是生活化藝術化的一種，當在值得我們注意了。</p>
<h3>追求偉大</h3>
<p>— （胡樹）</p>
<p>偉大－這個神秘而不可捉摸的名詞，這個空虚而不着邊際的東西，不知道它所以得到人們崇拜和羨慕的所在。</p>
<p>澈底説起來，一切事物幾乎都有它的偉大性，一草，一木，一鷄，一狗，只要你去追索它的不可及之點，像煞都是神聖不可侵犯，都是值得欽佩和贊嘆的。</p>
<p>所以大人先生有大人先生們的偉大，販夫走卒有販夫走卒們的偉大，只要能够發揮個性上的特長，就是了。更何必去追求。</p>

<h3>國貨産銷合作之新路</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>美國自宣布白銀國有計劃後，最受直接影響的，莫如我中國。因爲美國高唱提高銀價，美圓價格日低，已影響我國貿易很大。輸出旣感困難，而廉價貨物輸入大增，以刺激我國消費的社會，於是輸出入更加不能平衡。今年巨額之入超，已成爲顯明的事實，這是我們國貨界最痛心最困苦的境地。國内經濟學家一致表示經濟國難的臨頭，大聲疾呼，促醒國人，各自貢獻其救濟的方策。最澈底的，要算中國銀行經濟研究室主任張肖梅女士的意見。她説：（對付美國白銀政策，各方專家討論甚多，大致不外征收輸出税，禁銀出口。但事實上很不容易。據她看來，最有效的方法，莫如大家來購用國貨，因爲美銀政策，目的在提高物價，增加凿華貿易，我人如能洞察其計，大家自動的暢購國貨，試問他的政策，何從實施？這種見解和辦法，眞是很有價值，我聽了十二分的贊同。深深的希望全國國民在這經濟國難之下，不論生産的和推銷的服用的，要一致的想到國貨界前途的危險，來努力愛護國貨，改進國貨，樂用國貨。同時我想要解除這經濟國難的境地，不但在國内要儘量推銷，還要到國外去儘量的推銷。最近實業部和參加芝加哥博覽會出品恊會，將在歐美各國設立推銷機關，研究外人之習俗嗜好，與其社會之風尚，準備出品，爲海外之直接貿易。因爲據紐約領事葉可樑之報告，美國近來抵制德貨，大多數進出口公司，均登報聲明不辦德貨，日商乘機活動。可是美國人民，向不喜歡日貨，只因德國來源漸减，我國國貨商人，漫不注意，採辦無由，只得辦入日貨，美人之愛我者，都爲嘆惜。我國國貨界，亟宜趁此機會，自圖奮發，大可取日貨而代之。不過茲事體大，斷非一二人之力所能勝任，務使全國一致産銷合作，方可奏效，並主張由各商會各製造公會合設推銷國貨急進會，先從美國入手，在美設立陳列所三區，徴集我國出品，分陳列，以引起美國人的注意）云云。這種辦法，很有見解。現在實業部已令國際貿易局會同上海市商會，中華國貨産銷合作恊會切實核議。第一當使美人知中國國貨確多優美之處，第二使我人知美國市塲，最易銷售的爲何種國貨，彼此攻錯，效益自大。此舉不但於對外貿易，極有價值，而我國國貨從此多一新生路，白銀問題的恐慌，也可由此解决，一舉數得，願國貨界共起圖之。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>從玩具入超的驚人説到做家長的責任</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>有許多人對於提倡國貨的意見，認爲應該從兒童做起，尤其應該在兒童的思想方面，要打下一個終身誓志服用國貨，絶對不買外貨的觀念和决心，這種見解，我們認爲是十分合理，而且也是十二分的贊同的。</p>
<p>不過，話雖這樣説，這件事情的能否達到眞正的良好的成績，我們以爲還是應該從家庭裏的家長，和學校裏的教師，雙管齊下，共同努力才好，否則，僅僅靠一方面的努力，其成績還是微乎其微的，試觀本月份報紙記載的遊戲品進口五十七萬的消息，便可以證明我這句話不是瞎説了。</p>
<p>據各報記載：（我國雖正當國難孔殷時代，我國人均嬉戲不悟，甚者有救國不忘娛樂之呼聲，茲證之國際貿易局發表之游戲玩具之進口激增而益信，蓋本年六個月游戲玩具之進口，爲二九二·一九五金單位，折合國幣爲五十七萬七千九百六十二元，以與上年六個月進口爲二三三·一八八金單位相較，激增頗鉅，僅六月份進口，爲三二·九二二金單位，折合國幣爲六萬七千四百二十四元，國難嚴重下有此紀錄，誠使人不勝（感慨係之）云云。</p>
<p>唉！作者看了這一段兒童游戲玩具的進口額的一個駭人聽聞的數目字後，不禁咋舌者久之，繼而想想，這實在是一個嚴重的問題，不容我們漠然視之，認爲無足輕重呢？</p>
<p>其實，從這一段消息上看來，正反映出我們中國的一般兒童的家長，還是不能切實的服用國貨，還没有服用國貨之興趣，和深切的認識提倡國貨的重要性，這無疑地，是提倡國貨聲中一個嚴重的危機呀！</p>
<p>我們知道，兒童是無智無識的，他一切的需要，還是以家長的意志爲意志，（好玩），固然是兒童的天性，歡喜有東西在手裏玩，也是每個兒童一致的要求，可是，給兒童購置玩具之權，還是操在家長手裏，尤其是操在做兒童的母親的手裏，當兒童需要玩具的時候，做家長的應該量力而購置相當的玩具給他，以滿足兒童的希望慾，可是，在購置玩具的時候，最最要緊的，却是購置國貨的玩具，給你的親愛的小天使玩，同時，買回來之後，便可以解釋給兒童們知道，爲什麽不買外國貨的玩具？爲什麽定要購買國貨的玩具？這種的理由，一層一層的解釋給兒童聽，那末，兒童的小腦海中，便可以深深地打下一個服用國貨的觀念了，這個觀念，漸漸地在兒童的腦海中生長起來，便可以收到他終身服用國貨的效果，擴大的説：全國的兒童，都能如此，中國的國貨運動，便可以收到非常偉大的效果了。</p>
<p>但是，要做到這個地步，談何容易？非得全中國的兒童的家長，一致的起的家長們呀！你們的使命，是非常偉大，你們的責任，是異常重大，應該如何的努力，來達到這個目的呀！</p>
<p>（往者已矣，來者可追）。以往的事情，可以做我們一個深刻的教訓，我很希望全國兒童的家長們，因遊戲品入超的驚人的事情，而覺悟起來，做到一致的購用國貨玩具的地步。</p>
<h3>（兒童年）的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>是悲劇啊！慘痛的事實顯現着，在這次國際貿易局發表的統計中，我們竟又看到了本年度六個月兒童玩具的驚人輸入，爲五十七萬七千餘元，且與去年相較，聞也激增甚鉅，啊！足見這（救國不忘娛樂）的成績，誠得與前次發表的九十七萬餘元的香水脂粉進口數，先後映輝，同爲婦女國貨年的無上點綴品了。</p>
<p>本來今年是（婦女國貨年），而又是（兒童年），自然在我們的意想裏，一定爲我們的兒童們，正可受了母親或姊姊愛用國貨的薰陶，使他純潔的心靈裏，獲了不少愛國的思想，養成他正確的觀念，但事實是怎樣呢！它却早摧毁了我們熱烈的希望，却正是反在演映着兒童年的悲劇，－也正是（婦女國貨年）中成績顯現的一斑。</p>
<p>兒童是國家的未來主人翁，它有着改造社會，復興經濟的使命，而關於幼時教育時代的一舉一動，自尤足能影響於他將來事業的成敗，意志的良窳，那麽，我們現在旣知道，他們連無謂消耗的玩具，都在洋化的陶醉裏，其他吃的，穿的，自不必説，而行見這一批崇拜洋貨者，將卽由他惡劣的家庭裏，從速製造出來，使助長外人經濟侵略的嚴重性，妨礙國貨前途進展，我們一般從事國貨事業者，對之還可坐視嗎？</p>

<h3>我希望蘇州的國貨商塲</h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>天堂的蘇州，含有詩意的蘇州，這是一個江南富庶的都會，并且相近東方的巴黎－上海，所以上海風吹過來很快的，在衣食住方面，素來是考究的，這不是我的誑言，你一到了蘇州的南京路－觀前街，就可以看出富麗堂皇，應有盡有了。</p>
<p>蘇州也有過拍賣式的國貨商塲，不過是暫時性質，没有多時，關的開了，開的關了，没有組織，没有統系的，所以像曇花一現，不能持久了。</p>
<p>在蘇州的北局，建築了國貨商塲，現在正在建築了，大興士木，範圍宏大，在炎暑之下，邪許之聲，此起彼應，這也是國貨前途的好現象，不得不佩服蘇地的士紳們，有此熱心，有此毅力。</p>
<p>説句老實話，蘇州地方的服用外貨，喜用舶來品，也不亞於别地，我覺得京滬路綫，除了上海以外，也許蘇州可以算是亞軍了。你一到傍晚的時候，觀前街上，金閶路中，穿着外貨衣料的男女們，多如過江了之鯽，這不是國貨凋疲的現象嗎？</p>
<p>好了，蘇州的士紳們，有些覺悟了，發起集資組織國貨商塲，這是黑夜中的明亮燈光，多麽來得欣喜的事兒呀！</p>
<p>我希望蘇州的國貨商塲，開幕以後，蘇州人對於國貨有相當的認識，那末國貨前途，從蘇州地方，也許可以影響到中國的各地了，這是值得欣喜報告的事。</p>
<p>國貨寫眞</p>
<h3>一個從洋貨向國貨投誠者的供狀</h3>
<p>— 徐仁女士</p>
<p>我現在很誠懇地向讀者承認在過去我實在是一員洋貨消耗大將，從前的觀點是覺得非舶來品不够出風頭，穿不上身，可是現在呢，目睹國計日衰，觀點也大改，我現用的日常用品雖尚未辦到全用國貨！但已一大半由外國貨改爲本國貨了。我並下了一個决心把所用品均採用國貨。</p>
<p>我改用國貨的步驟是怎樣呢？把我過去的經騐寫出來也許對於熱心提倡國貨的同胞有些小小的貢獻，我當時雖下了决心，但在這行頗感不易，因多年的積習、非一夕所能除去，於是我遂取用緩攻方法，從小處先下手。</p>
<p>在兩年前五月起，我便實行我的計劃，第一步我先把我的日用品先檢點一下，看有多少不是國貨，然後把非國貨用品列了一張單，第二步我便誓每月改用兩種國貨，改用後便把此兩項用品在洋貨單上用紅筆鈎了，這樣一來，成績以一月作單位看雖不大，但此二年中我的用品，差不多均由舶來品變成國貨了</p>
<p>舉一個顯明的例子，像晨起洗盥罷：以前面盆，漱口杯，毛巾均是洋貨，牙擦是用“Prophylactic”片膏用Lis</p>
<p>renrine”面皂用，籃腰但現在呢，我的面盆和漱口杯均是，立鶴牌，其餘用的是，一心牌牙擦，西湖毛巾，三星牙膏和椰子香皂。這完全是國貨！</p>
<p>或許有人要問我用了國貨後有甚不同？那我就要説了，在物質享用方面我分不出國貨與洋貨有甚麽軒輊，但金錢倒省了不少，因國貨總較洋貨價廉，在精神方面，自改用國貨當聽及看見金錢在洋貨方面向外溢，我用不着低頭汗顔，同時在另一方面看到國貨興榮却有説不出的興奮好像我也是其中培植它們繁盛的一份子，尤其到了每月終了，用紅筆向那洋貨單鈎去二種洋貨時更有説不出的高興，和驕傲，因好像覺得自己對於國家盡了一些責任，過去的一月没有白過！</p>
<p>我這種緩攻辦法站在同陣線的同志以爲怎樣？也來試騐一下好麽？</p>
<h3>這是什麽時代？</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>狂獸般外貨的儘銷，多麽利害，我們國貨的進行，倒反像（輕舟過海），</p>
<p>風又大，浪又澎湃。荆棘叢生的前途，這是什麽時代？</p>

<h3>君子國</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>發憤爲雄君子態，味心忘本小人行！　　話説林之洋挈了多九公唐敖二人，又到海外去作賣買。船行多日，已到了君子國境界。將船泊岸，林之洋上去兜銷貨物；唐多二人，因在船没事，也便上去閒逛。好在這君子國前已來過，不須問訊，一逕向城門走來。只見城門上漆着副大聨：上句是（君子爲寳），下句是（發憤爲雄）。唐敖暗暗奇怪，心想我上次來時，城門上的聨語是這樣寫的：（和平爲懷）（好讓不爭）怎麽現在改成這語句呢？其中必有道理。隨即進城，只見人烟輳集，商業茂盛；來來往往的人，個個布衣布履，樸素非凡；而且雄糾糾氣昻昻露出一股英明之氣，絶無從前顚頭晃腦的寒酸腔了。多九公見了，也暗暗的在稱奇。二人走了多時，脚已酸麻，便進了茶肆憇坐。堂倌泡上茶來，二人喝了一遍，唐敖見旁邊坐着一位老者，白首皓眉，態度和藹，便和他攀談起來，又把剛纔所見的問訊。那老者掀着銀髯笑道：（不錯從前我們的確是文縐縐的不好和人爭鬥。不過處這弱肉强吞的世界，你要和平，别人不肯和平；你要禮讓，别人步步進佔。我們君子國是以文弱出名的，旁邊一個野心國，便天天來欺壓，今天奪去我們一個城市，明天又侵略我們一個要塞，我們人民發了急，個個振起精神，發憤禦敵，纔把野心國的威燄壓低些。國王恐怕人民事過了便要忘懷，所以漆着這一付聨語，用以警惕人心。）老者説到這裏，只見林之洋愁眉苦臉的也走向茶座子裏來，唐敖招呼他坐下，忙問道；舅兄！賣買得利嗎？）林之洋一邊喝着茶，一邊摇着頭説道；（眞是活見鬼咧！日常不論到那一個國裏，多少總佔些油水；而且前幾次到海外來，君子國又是一個銷貨容易的所在。那知今日到此，東問也摇頭，西問也不要，瞧這光景，恐怕送給他們，他們也要拒而不納咧！你想奇怪不奇怪？）林之洋説到這裏，旁邊的老者揷口道：（客官！想必你多年未曾到此，所以不知道裏新近的風俗。我們受了野心國欺壓以後，不但全國人民整軍經武；便是外邊的貨物，也立誓一文不買。因爲你買一文外貨，國家便少一文錢財。兩國爭戰起來，金錢便是武力的後盾，倘使國家没有充裕的財力，怎好和敵持久呢！而且貴國又有一句成語呌做一君子不忘其本，）請問作何解法？林之洋口快，便搶先説道：（那很便當的語句，便是説君子人不忘其根本的意思。）老者點點頭説道”（錯是不錯！不過我們另有一解：是説君子人不忘本國的種種物，愛本國的土地，愛本國的人民，愛本國的貨物，那便是這語句的眞實註解，不知道客官們电下如何？）唐多二人聽了，不住的點頭稱好。這時林之洋怒氣衝衝的説道：（你們講甚麽本不本，害得俺們賣買作不成，眞是晦氣。）説罷，便拖了唐多二人，走出茶　　　到船　　掛起　帆，　　離關那君子國境　　。</p>

<h3>學校勞作科新材料</h3>
<p>－自立工藝社發明－</p>
<p>我國中小學校勞作科中多有石膏黏土手工，惟石膏工作最感困難者，爲立體像之翻模。因通常用石膏或石花菜爲陰模，一則太硬，一則太脆，不耐久用，是以學生不易獲有良好結果。本市施高塔路四達里一號自立工藝社最近發明特種彈性橡皮，用以製造陰模，可無上述缺點，且能整塊製模，不須分凑，翻製石膏像或人造大理石像工作容易，成績甚佳。現在本外埠學校多向該社定製此項橡皮模型，以供學生之用。該社因其他出品頗多未能零星代人製模，故將製法公開，凡學校勞作科教員學生有相當介紹者，均可到該社實習製法，不收費用。該社又有新出彈性黏士一種，可代平常黏土之用，學生用此揑製成物，再以簡法加熱，卽成彈性橡皮製品，抛擲不壞，此亦新奇勞作材料之一。此外尚有多種勞作新材料，如人造大理石，銅像，假象牙，輕氣球，電鍍，橡皮圖章等，均能用最簡便方法，使小學生操作自如。該社創辦人林履彬君，本由師範及工業出身，曾任商務印書館編譯，關於學校勞作科書籍，著譯亦不少云。</p>
<h3>洋貨擔</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>（洋貨擔），是我們湖州人對於洋頭洋尾，滿身洋貨的仁兄的一個尊稱。</p>
<p>我們知道（洋貨擔），是挑在肩上，手上摇着叢鼓，走在街頭巷尾，販賣（洋貨）的擔子。我們湖州人把來作爲洋來洋去滿身洋貨的仁兄的一個尊稱，就是無異呌這班（洋迷）爲（洋貨推銷員），眞是確切之至，妙不可醬油。</p>
<p>但是，説也可嘆，大凡（洋迷），莫不臉皮厚似牛皮。任憑你尊稱他們是（洋貨擔）也好，是（洋貨推銷員）也好。他們是不但不以爲忤，而且還自以爲榮！神情大有笑駡由你笑駡，（洋貨擔）我自爲之之槪。唉！莊子説：哀莫大於心死一，我想大家都是這樣心死了，那又何怪（提倡國貨），　行之數十年，毫無成效，徒使洋貨入超，一年增加一年呢？</p>
<p>唉！（洋貨擔）！（洋貨擔）！你眞是摧殘國貨的罪魁！希望你快快覺悟，堅决地，認眞地，洗心革面來提倡國貨，抵制洋貨。否則，如果老是做着（洋貨擔），那麽，難免國亡，終有變做（亡國奴）的一天！</p>

<h3>安貧樂道法</h3>
<p>— 史賁</p>
<p>孩子是要别人教的，毛病是要别人醫的，卽使自己是教員或醫生。但做人處世的法子，却恐怕要自己斟酌，許多别人開來的良方，往往不過是廢紙。</p>
<p>勸人安貧樂道是古今治國平天下的大經絡，開過的方子也很多，但都没有十全大補的功效。因此新方子也開不完，新近就看見了兩種，但我想：恐怕都不大妥的。</p>
<p>一種是教人對於職業要發生興趣，一有興趣，就無論什麽事，都樂此不倦了。當然，言之成理的，但到底須是輕鬆一點的職業。且不説掘煤，挑糞那些事，就是上海工廠裏做工至少每天十點的工人，到晚快邊就一定筋疲力倦，受傷的事情是大抵出在那時候的。（健全的精神，宿於健全的身體之中），連自己的身體也顧不轉了，怎麽還會有興趣？——除非他愛興趣比性命還利害。倘若問他們自己罷，我想，一定説是减少工作的時間，做夢也想不到發生興趣法的。</p>
<p>還有一種是極其徹底的：大熱天氣，闊人還忙於應酬，汗流浹背，窮人却挾了一條破席，鋪在路上，脱衣服，浴凉風，其樂無窮，這呌作（席捲天下）。這也是一張少見的富有詩趣的藥方，不過也有煞風景在後面。快要秋凉了，一早到馬路上去走去，看見手捧肚子，口吐黄水的就是那些（席捲天下）的前任活神仙。大約眼前有福，偏不去享的大愚人，世上究竟是不多的，如果精窮眞是這麽有趣，現在的闊人一定首先躺在馬路上，而現在的窮人的席子也没有地方鋪開來了。</p>
<p>上海中學會考的優良成績發表了，有（衣取寒食取充腹論），其中有一段——</p>
<p>（……若德業已立，則雖饔飱不繼，捉襟肘見，而其名德足傳於後，精神生活，將充分發展，又何患物質生活之不足耶？人生眞諦，固在彼而不在此也。……）（由（新語林）第三期轉錄）</p>
<p>這比題旨更進了一步，説是連不能（充腹）也不要緊的。但中學生所開的良方，對於大學生就不適用，同時還是出現了要求職業的一大羣。</p>
<p>事實是毫無情面的東西，牠能將空言打得粉碎。有這麽的彰明較著，其實，據我的愚見，是大可以不必再玩（之乎者也）了——横豎永遠是没有用的。</p>
<h3>出路</h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>世上有着不少的路，東西南北，長短闊狹，其中有一條，好像是專留給青年們摸索的，呌做出路。</p>
<p>出路而必須摸索，就可見要出的不容易了。但也有人歸罪於摸索者的頭上，據説是才力弱，眼界高，這毛病很使學者們憂心，於是背上藥包，存心濟世，專治的靈藥有兩種：一帖是自覺，一帖是反省</p>
<p>反省和自覺，譬之川連和胡黄連，雖然産自異地，名稱各别，但性道是差不多的。自覺必須反省，反省還該自覺，歸根結底，倘無出路，那是只有罪己的。</p>
<p>但罪已的結果，也終於還找不到出路。才力弱，眼界高，這是通病，雖富於世故的學者不免，自然也有年青人，可是並不多。年青人没有地位，没有聲望，喊破喉嚨，跑穿脚底，還不值五千元，於是乎只好自登廣告，來一個（不計薪水）。能力雖很薄弱，終不至於不值分文，然而竟弄到分文不值。事實久已教給了他們，眼界是高不起來的。</p>
<p>可見只要有路，也還願意走走，至於出不出，年青人是决不敢計及的。</p>
<p>中國古代有一個阮籍，他生性喜歡遊覽，高興的時候，常常整天不歸，除非碰到走不通的路，才只好哭著回到家里。然而他是仕大夫。</p>
<p>非仕大夫的年青人，倘遇窮途，那是才力薄弱；還想哭麽，這就頗有眼界高的嫌疑了。</p>
<p>年青人是這樣地不易爲的。</p>
<h3>從語言學上的見地來討論歐化問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 何鳳元</p>
<p>夾在文言，白話，大衆語爭論中的，還有歐化不歐化的問題來凑熱閙，有位仁兄説歐化是漢奸幹的勾當，有位仁兄説（中國語法裏必需加點歐化），這實在和文言，白話，大衆語的爭論一樣的空費口舌。殊不知文字語言這東西，自有牠種種社會關係影響下的演變的必然路徑，决不是你們那一位吹得響，擂得起勁，就會跟那一位跑的。你説歐化是（漢奸），牠有時候就非（奸）奸不可，你説語法裏必需加點歐化，牠也不會依着你眞就加點歐化。牠不需歐化處，並不是怕做（漢奸），却自有牠不需歐化處的必然的緣故：牠需歐化處，也自有牠需歐化的（苦衷）。這樣爭論的無謂，只消我們借鏡完全類似此的十六七八世紀的英語外國化的爭論就可以明白，那時初從倫敦方言升爲國語的英文，也逢着我們現在這樣的一個爭端，有些人——奈須ThomasNash，愛利亞ThomasＥlyot,裴蒂George　Pettie等－傾慕着拉丁文，修辭語法的美妙，説應當摸擬拉丁文，借用外國字來改良英語；另一些（國粹派）Purists－愛夏姆RogerAsham,維爾遜ThomasViison等－却就指着奈須等爲（英奸），説英語裏不該有一點外國成分，有半個外國字。這個爭執一直閙下來一二百年，後來國粹派還主張設立國家學院，來制止外國文影響的侵入。約翰生博士Samuel　Johnson還著了他那一本有名的字典，來保持國粹英語。但是英語是依了誰呢？牠是誰都没有依，牠接受了部分的外國文的影響，借用了許多外國字（現在英語的字彚約有四分之三是外國字），國粹未完全保存，博士先生的字典到現在不過是書架上放放的古典。但是他也没有如奈須們的意見般的外國化，英語仍是英語。</p>
<p>這兒舉着的，並不是一個偶然的例，却是表現了文字演變原理的事實。就是文字這東西，必然的要接受外來的或内發的影響的，他不會依着某個個人主觀的意見。除非英國人不和國外文化溝通，否則英語裏就必然的要有外國成分；除非英國和國外文化溝通後自己的種族習慣，及種種遺産部完全消滅，否則英國話就不會完全外國化。像這樣可參證的例實在也多得很，又譬如美國（英）語也有過同樣的爭執，畢扣林John　Pickering吳爾綏斯𢖼Ｗorcestcr華脱　Ricbard　GrantWhite等强着美國（英）語要依英國英語爲標凖，但以大字典出名的那個韋勃斯𢖼却主張美國（英）語自有美國的標凖。可是美國（英）語也誰都不依照，牠有牠的英國處，也有牠的美國處。</p>
<h3>瑪爾及其語言學説</h3>
<p>— 宜閑</p>
<p>近來有近來有許多人漸漸覺得一般的所謂白話有着改造的必要。而且大衆語運動的旗子也豎起來了。可是要確定這個又重大又複雜的語體改革運動的趨向，單是憑着直覺的見解是不夠的，我們還得用語言學上最進步的新學説做着根據纔是。趁這大家熱烈地討論着大衆語問題的當兒，我就把這種新學説，即雅弗學説（Japhetic　theory）的創立者，蘇聨語言學家瑪爾（N.J.Marr）簡略地來介紹一下。</p>
<p>瑪爾是蘇聨的國家物質文化學院的院長，又是蘇聨的中央執行委員，現年七十歲。他對於東方語言的科學研究，有整整四十五年的歷史了。</p>
<p>他生在外高加索。他的父親，一個有名的園藝家，是蘇格蘭人，他的母親是喬治亞人。雖然他父親的早死使家境困難起來，他的母親却盡心竭力地培植他讀書。一八八三年他進了彼得堡大學。便在那裏研究着東方語言。（亞刺伯語，叙利亞語，希伯來語，亞美尼亞語，喬治亞語等）</p>
<p>他對於他所選定的學科有着異常的成績。畢業後，他繼續做着亞美尼亞語的研完工作。</p>
<p>從他研究東方語言的開頭，瑪爾對於抹煞了殖民地和半殖民地民族的語言，而一味推崇着印度歐羅巴系語言這一種當時流行着的意見，就表示反對的態度了。</p>
<p>在革命以前的時期，瑪爾對於這種帝國主義宣傳的抗議隠藏在科學的術語和文體中間。他的著作這纔有大部分在當時的科學界是覺得晦澀的。大家便把他看作創立異説的怪僻的學者了。</p>
<p>瑪爾的語言學説，有着革命的精神和傾向，這在當時完全了解的人並不多。這種學説，他自稱雅弗學説。内中重要的幾點是這樣的。語言的構造是在恒久的運動中，决定着這運動的是語言的製造者，即人類社會的運動。因此，語言的構造是可以當作人類所經過的歷史的各時代的證據的。瑪爾把語言當作社會所决定的東西，便側重於人類勞動的特性，即意識。人們從動物脱離得愈遠，他們加於（自然）的影響便愈顯着指向一種預定的目的的有意志有計劃的行動的性質。這種有計劃的勞動是人類的顯著的特徴。</p>
<p>在逐漸的歷史的進化中，思想的各種典型的發展，在瑪爾對於語言規象的研究上是持别注重的。</p>
<p>最先説明了從勞動的過程上，語言的發展的是恩格爾，他曾經説過：經濟的活動愈是複雜起來，思想便也愈具體化。聲音上的音節（Aritculation）是長久連續着的社會的影響加於發音器官的結果。</p>
<p>瑪爾依了相同的路綫，繼續研究下去，終於，如蘇聨的著名學者梅什却尼諾甫所説，完成了語言學上煊赫的改造。這包括着語言上完全變更的分類法，這種分類法是用人類社會的歷史所提示的原則做着根據的。至於把各種語言追溯到原始的語族這一種舊方法，不消説是已經完全廢棄了。</p>
<p>十月革命使瑪爾把先前多少有些掩飾着的意思可以自由説出來。他便在文字上，在有着政治意味的實際工作上，把他的學説繼續發揮着。</p>
<p>他因爲對於蘇聨的東方少數民族，有着透徹的認識的緣故，在那些民族的拉丁化字母的工作上，就幹得重要的角色。在東部的民族間，他的名聲很大，這是他的工作的結果，原來他確立了他們對於自己的文化的權利，還帮助着發展那種文化。</p>
<p>瑪爾年年連續地出版各種論文和著作，把他那不息的科學研究的成果發表出來，他那對於人類語言的起原和歷史的理論這纔逐漸地發揚光大了。</p>
<p>瑪爾雖然已經到了這樣的高齡，却還作爲幾個科學團體的領袖，作爲作家和探險家，繼續工作着。他那還未脱稿的最近的論文是探討着俄羅斯語，白俄羅斯語和烏克蘭語的相互關係的。</p>
<h3>牽牛織女星</h3>
<p>— ＴＫ</p>
<h3>老人（五）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>他一面想着一面把酒倒在杯子裏送到嘴邊，只一口就减去了小半杯的容量，突然地他想起來莫不成他的沙夏已經不在人世了麽？</p>
<p>這樣想着了，他就記起來沙夏自從走了之後兩年中未曾寄過一封信來，也没有從别人的嘴裏聽到沙夏的信息；而且在前一年，也許是前五天，他有過一個夢，夢中他看到沙夏瘦得不像人樣站在他的面前。</p>
<p>他打了一個寒戰，一切都像暗示着他的沙夏一定是死去了，他恨着自己不該在他走的時候發着詛咒，也許是他的詛咒把沙夏害死的。</p>
<p>（——這不可能，這不可能。）</p>
<p>他獨自在心中默默地説着，他想到仁良的上帝，不該再奪去他的孫子，他的獨一的孫子。</p>
<p>他追想着自己結婚後五年，那個不義的妻就不知道逃到了什麽地方去，爲他留下了一個三歲的兒子。雖然他那時候還有能力使另外一個女人成爲他的妻，可是因爲怕了一切從女人上所引起的糾紛，就没有那樣做。在他的照顧之下，他的兒子長到了該從父親的膝下走到女的的懷中的年齡。可是後來他的兒子在婚後又很快地死於軍役。</p>

<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>公私之别</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>國際電報通例，列政府電報爲一等，公務電報爲二等，加急商電與尋常私人電報則在其次。斯非對於一二等電報。特别提高也，蓋重其爲公而發耳，故因公發電，例應首遞，非所以語私事。</p>
<p>官也軍也，電之所傳，祗當限於政事或軍事，否則卽與官軍電之名稱與性質不符；公務電報，（卽與電報本身有關之各種公電）亦應祗談公務，不涉他語，理所宜然，不容或紊、但自積弊相承，發電斯濫，往往有以私人消息，作公電拍發，一轉移間，能化私而爲公，或假公以濟私，爲發電者計固得，而電局之損失不可問矣。</p>
<p>官軍電拍發受優待，公務電傳送盡免費，倘公私之界限不分，而均受同等之優待與免費。電報之傳遞，所費材料幾何？維持費用幾何？結果將無所取償，一處然，推而全國亦然，其損失寗有限量？電政收支相抵，按年不無虧短，縱其原因非一，但電報之濫，亦爲關心電信事業者所深致槪焉。</p>
<p>欲加補救，自應於電報方面，嚴公私之别。現行辦法，各局見有公電而涉及私事者，有扣留處罰之規定，斯對於内部而言。若官軍電報，一經傳遞，苟其電文，不限於政務或軍務，則仍常向發寄者照私人電報補費。此種取締，初非首創，衡諸各國，莫不盡然，明達者對此，自應表深切之同情也。</p>
<p>尚有言者，公私之别旣嚴，電報之濫可免，發寄官軍電與公電者，一經審愼顧慮。行見行傳電報，其性質莫不眞正合乎條例。電路旣得澄清，電備更趨迅捷，豈獨關於電政收入方面，蒙其利益哉？</p>
<p>討論</p>
<h3>公用電話問題</h3>
<p>— 寄然</p>
<p>讀前期本刊，有提出公用電話問題，以爲討論者，頗饒興味。查公用電話之在我國各地，確屬少見，爲便利一般未裝話機而思用話機者着想，與其借打電話感覺困難，自以就近能得公用電話，較有利益。鄙人不敏，敢以管見所及，加以縷述，俾就正於關心電信事業諸君。</p>
<p>私意以爲公用電話在我國未能推行各地，其原因甚多，最重要者，有下列兩點</p>
<p>（甲）使用問題－各地電話事業，近年來確見進步，但仍未能謂爲充分發達。通商巨埠，居民使用電話次數多者，大致均不不惜月出區區話費，故多已家備一機。若臨時欲借打電話者，不過少數，且亦散於各處。今如於某都市内，分裝公用話機十具，假定每次市内通話費爲五分。此十具話機，設使裝於用户，按月話局收入，爲六十元，而公用電話。費所得，不過三四十金，或更比此數爲小，則同一話機之被佔用，話局因公用電話之開放，不免受有損失。就此而論，苟市内使用公用電話者，人數不多，話費無幾，勢必話局材料機件以及維持等費，無所取償，此關於業務方面而言也。</p>
<p>（乙）裝置問題－爲便利市民着想。則公用電話之裝置地點，最關緊要。事先苟無精密之支配，行見有若干處所，使用公用電話者較多，而其餘之處，用者絶少。此種情形，固非理想之談也。以我國各大都市如京滬津漢等地而言，區域極廣，佈置極難，如盡量裝設，則目前尚無充分之話機與材料，苟約裝幾具，則又覺所能便利於民衆者，收效殊尠；况公用電話，旣如晨星，市民欲通話者，與其遠行打一公用電話，寗就近情商，作一度借用矣。</p>
<p>上述祗就所懷，槪略言之，殊未能謂爲允當，不過本刊旣舉出此問題，以事商討，則公用電話之推行，與實施，固宜處處求所以便利市民，且亦應同時爲局方業務着想，欲謀解决，於斯兩點，應先加注意者也。</p>
<p>電信叢談</p>
<h3>電話－自動</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>▲用户順次轉盤　▲機械逐步動作</p>
<p>自動電話，關於綫路方面，以及話機式樣，與其用法，爲用户所深知，本刊前數期，亦已談及，更無庸多所論列；但欲明電話之自動，非見識電話局内之機械不可。用户使用話機，在轉盤上旋轉號碼，所有者祗有轉盤之能自行回至原位，其他更無所謂自動也，故眞正的機械自動，不在綫路，不在用户話機，而在局内的機器。</p>
<p>局内的機器，簡别之，可分爲兩部，其一部用以供給通信之電流（包括振鈴通話等），此則屬於電源另一部則聽命於用户，實行接續，斯卽自動機械。</p>
<p>我人苟參觀自動話局，當見各架之上，所裝機械，排次而列，東聞（滴搭）之聲，西亦聆擦喇之響，斯皆接受用户指頭上所發之命令，逐步進行，媒介旣成，語音始達，蓋機械正在作自動的牽綫工作也。</p>
<p>目迷五色，在未明究竟者，殆未能免，茲先將局中自動接綫簡圖，略爲解釋，以此推想，思過半矣。</p>
<p>通用户話機，爲綫路開關，有中繼綫（Trunk）以通第一選擇器，（FirstSelector）由第一選擇器，至第二選擇器（Second　Selector），更抵接達器（Ccnnector），中間亦各有中繼綫，以資聨絡各中繼綫之數，視業務之需要而定，卽就用户呼呌之多寡，以爲支配者也，茲請試舉一例，以説明機械自動接續之大槪</p>
<p>設如自動電話交換機之容量，祗適用於不滿一千號之用户則其設備，爲綫路開關，第一選擇舉（無第二選擇器）及接達器等。如交換機容量，可自一萬號增至十萬號，則線路開關及接達器中間，有第一第二以至第三各選擇器；總之，交換機之容量愈大，號碼旣增，選擇器亦隨而加多也。</p>
<p>茲假定該部自動交換機爲能容一萬號者，則用户使用時所經過接續，乃先由話機通綫路開關，經第一及第二選擇器，乃由接達器以連至被喚用户之話機。如所轉之號數爲一二三四，則則進行自動接續，所簡單述之如下。</p>
<p>（一）用户舉起耳機預備轉盤，該綫之綫路開關，發生動作，將綫自動接至適在空閑之第一選擇器，並發出嗡嗡之聲，所謂（達而通）是。</p>
<p>（二）用户轉動第一個號碼（一），脈搏電流傳至第一選擇器，該器卽自動選擇某組空中的繼線，接至第二選擇器。此第二選擇器所能接通之範圍，乃自一○○○至一九九九號，同時（達而通）亦脱離綫路，不復可聞。</p>
<p>（三）用户轉動第二個號碼（二）二時，斯際卽使第二選擇器發生動作，如上述之選擇，經過空的中繼綫，連至接達器。該器所能接達之範圍，係由一二○○至一二九九號。</p>
<p>（四）進用户將末後兩個號碼（三）及（四）撥動時，此二次脈搏電流，通過接達器，使在一二○○至一二九九號中間，（卽百家用户）將三四號選出接通，因此所喚之用户一二三四號，正式聨絡，並使振鈴電流，通過被喚話機，鈴乃大鳴</p>
<h3>郵電合設之歷史觀</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>近年以來，交通當局對於交通行政與業務各方面，勵精圖治，卓著新猷。其最大目標，爲便利民衆，節省開支，增加效率三項。郵電合設，卽貫澈三大目的者也。查郵電同以通信爲營業，同在交部管轄之下辦理業務，雖專門技術，各有不同，而使民目的，初無二致。茲經交部毅然頒布郵電合設辦法，自三月一日起，先從江蘇浙江河北三省試辦，再自七月一日起，全國一律實行。從此全國各地，能通郵之處，卽能收報，能發報之處，卽能投郵。郵電合併，初步已具成功，此在我國交通史上可大書特書者也。</p>
<p>顧郵電合設之議，不自我圖始，而困難之點，我國似較各國爲少。良以各國郵政，創立已有百餘年悠久歷史，而電報不過六七十年，電話不過三四十年，設施經營，均須專門技術，故起始皆獨立營業。且郵電創設，多係民營，本身尚未健全，後經國家管轄，均須加以嚴格整理，故雙方發展程度，亦各有别。具此二因，欲求郵電合併，殊非咄嗟間所能集事。茲將英日兩國辦理之過程述之：</p>
<p>（一）英國：英倫郵政總局爲十七世紀（一六八九年第一次任命郵政總監）所設置，電報則於一八四六年由商辦所創立，至一八七○年始歸政府經營。電話事業於一八八○年亦由商辦所創立，政府對於長途電話之經營，着手於一八九二年，市内電話着手於一八九九年。至一九一三年政府始將全國商辦電話收管。如此各具特别沿革之郵政電報電話，其始全爲分立，後歸政府漸次合併。</p>
<p>（二）日本：日本郵電事業，自始亦非國營。蓋郵政於明治四年（一八七一）始屬於内務省，電報於明治二年（一八六九）屬於工務省，各自爲政。至明治十八年（一八八五）統歸遞信省管轄。於是地方郵電合併之議以起，贊成反對，各執一詞，再閲八年，郵電實行合併，修改章程，稱爲一二三等郵便電信局。至電話事業，雖亦由遞信省之電務局創設，而地方電話局，全與郵便電報局分離，至明治三十六年，（一九○三）在官制上始與郵電局合併。其電話交換室，尚不能急速合併，故須待日後改築局舍或變更機械時，乃可能也。</p>
<p>統觀英日先例郵電合併之過程，其始由人民創設，後歸政府收買，最後始行合併，經過相當之時期，又不知幾費周章者也。我國電政，自清光緒五年（一八七九）起，卽由國家經營後，雖經官督商辦與商欵官辦兩個時期，至光緒三十四年（一九○八）仍歸國營。我國郵政自始亦卽歸國營、於光緒二十三年（一八九六）由海關總税務司赫德經理，隸屬總理衙門，旋改隸外交部。至宣統三年（一九一一）郵政與海關始行劃分，遂與電政同隸交通部直至今日，郵電兩政同在一主管部同管轄之下，已有三十餘年歷史，統一主權，平均發展，無門户之見與畛域之分，故言郵電合設，首先將房屋合併辦公，而經濟指揮，仍存原來統系，祗須釐定辦法，卽可通令實行，數月以來，蘇•浙•皖•冀•魯•豫六省成績最著•其餘各省，均次第推行。交部復於六月二十三日特派視察員十餘員，分途赴各省專門視察郵電合設事宜，將來進步，當更有可觀也。</p>
<h3>郵政儲金局代電政機關收付欵項問題</h3>
<p>— 南窗</p>
<p>電政當局爲推行郵電合設起見，曾由電政局與郵政儲金匯業總局訂立合同，將全國通商大埠及繁要處所之電報及電話局曁幾電臺收入欵項，委托代理收付，事極平常，不意引起郵務兩工會，通電反對，稍生誤會。其實在電政當局，不特趁此郵電合設期間，表示財政公開，恰好及時推行，而交通部原有金同内容，又有切實担保，百足之蟲，尤無他慮。外傳郵局月須賠貼若干，實屬無稽之談，聞試辦第一個月——本年七月份，各項收付帳目，均已結算清楚，收支兩抵，尚存十餘萬元，足見進行順行，郵電兩均受其益也。</p>
<h3>幾種特别的電報</h3>
<p>— 老談</p>
<p>電報人知其爲電報而已，但是電報中間，也分若干門類，其中儘有比較特别者，現且略舉二三，以作談助：</p>
<p>賀年電報，於耶誕時節或陽歷年頭，各處局臺，多有收受。這是一種往來酬酢的電報，但是人們遠隔重洋，或分居遠地，收到了這一封電報，自然更能增加情感，發生這一種（秋水伊人）之思。</p>
<p>天文臺報，是報告氣象的，尤其在氣温發生變化，颶風侵襲之先，這種氣象報告，關係人民生命很重。電文大抵很簡單而明晰的，由電報局爲之免費傳送。</p>
<p>聽了（遲緩電報）的名詞，或者一定要誤會，説電報也不見得迅速；但是所謂（遲緩），乃是發報人所願意的。發報人情願少出報費，讓這一通電報，在報務清閑時拍出。遲緩的意義，不過表示可以拍發在别種電報之後，實際上並不過遲，比航空信快的多呢。</p>
<p>排字要校對，記賬要校對，電報似乎在電綫上傳送，一拍一抄，無須校對然而有若干電報，發寄的人們，恐偶有錯誤，影響殊大，所以爲安心起見，也有要求局臺，加以校對，局臺方面，當然唯命是從，不過另加一種校對費罷了（這是機上校對，所發的報，複拍一次）。校對並不一定指全體電文，也有祗須校對電文中幾個字或數者，完全視發報人之意旨而定。</p>
<h3>莫氏機改爲直列式之優點</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>歐美各國所用之電報機，由莫爾斯機而韋斯頓機而克利特機而印字機，由單工而雙工而多工，新陳代謝，精益求精，故進步甚速。此間有留用莫氏機以資通報者，大都採用直列式接綫法，技術經濟各方，均爲有利。返觀我國電局，十之八九，尚利用莫氏機，而該項報機之回綫，多係數機合用一綫輪流工作者。其接綫方法，除三數回綫應用直列式外，餘均用並列式，不特耗費電能，抑且减低工效。交通部爲改進報務起見，特製定直列式莫氏機接綫法及工作須知一種，於今年五月十八日通令全國各局，將莫氏機並列式電路，除報話雙用之回綫從緩改接外，其餘限令到一個月内，一律改接直列式工作，其優點可得而言之：</p>
<p>（一）運用便利：並列式回綫中繼電器所接收之電流，雖路綫本身，無漏電影響，亦以離發報局遠近而大小其數值，此種接收電流之變動，尤以同機工作之局所較多者爲甚。若欲與同綫各局工作，非及時校正其繼電器，以適合接收之電流不可。運用旣不便利，障礙易於發生。若改裝直列式，則上部下部中間各局電流齊一，而繼電器所接收之電流，若綫路上無漏電之病，可固定不變，故校正繼電器後，可與任何局工作，不須臨時校正。</p>
<p>（二）節省電能：根據實際計算，以江蘇省區及鄰區有關各局電力總數而言，如一律改用直列式回綫後，所省電力，爲九五·一○瓦。假定有關各局每日發電時間，平均爲二小時，則每月所省雷力，爲五七○六瓦一小時。又假定每濕電瓶之容量爲十瓦一小時，則每月可省濕電瓶爲五七一隻。若以全國電局電瓶計之，其數當有可觀矣。</p>
<h3>公衆如何促進國際無綫電信事業之發展</h3>
<p>— 丁海濤</p>
<p>國際無綫電臺，爲我國營唯一之大規模企業，其關係於我國家民族方面者綦鉅，換言之，國家無對外宣傳機關，卽無以示其獨立之精神；民族缺乏自主之國際通訊，卽無以發揚光大；是以我國際無綫電臺所負之使命，固不限於挽回利權已耳，前項意義旣已闡明，凡我國人亟應如何促進該項事業之發展？以期克盡國民天職，蓋我國際電訊事業之發展，尤賴於羣策羣力者也：茲擬具辦法如次，凡我國人幸速圖之！</p>
<p>（一）國人自辦之國際貿易亟應一律採用國際無綫電報——所謂國人自辦之國際貿易，換言之，卽國人之資本以經營國際商業而有完全自主性者，亟應家喻户曉，聨合同業，一律採用國際無綫電報Via　CGRA，同時因營業與外洋通郵時，並應努力，代爲介紹鼓吹，以促對方之採用。倘其不允改交無綫電拍發者，應由該商聲明：凡交他路轉遞之電報，如有遲誤，因而影響於商務者，不能負責等語。並一面將各外埠通報地名詳細抄交當地局臺之（業務稽查員）彚轉，直接招徠，以竟全功，蓋我自主之對外貿易，姑無論其經營出口或進口，均可自行决定其拍發電報之路由，而不受外洋商人之牽制者也。</p>
<p>（二）各洋行華買辦應恊助局臺業務稽查員招徠國際無綫電報——我國際無綫電報，自經開辦以來，卽以其本身機件之完備，辦理之認眞，而博得各洋商之信仰；是以此項業務進展之速度，誠出於吾人理想之外。雖然，此固該事業本身之精進，而得力於各洋行華買辦之助力者亦頗有足多，然各洋商或亦有昧於我國際電臺之精神而拒交由新電路拍發，則華買辦應就近直接向洋員解釋，倘猶有隔閡之處，亦可通知當地局臺之業務稽查員，會同剖白，以期我國際無綫電事業，得以推行順利。</p>
<p>綜之，今日之國營事業，前途發展，正方興未艾。凡我國人，亟應明瞭其本身之立塲，羣起促進，則將來國營事業發達之日，亦卽我國家民族復興之時。凡我國入，幸三思之！</p>
<p>（三）增加直達局所减少轉報：採用並列式之結果，一電路之接續局數限於三處或四處以上，否則通信時間，須有限制，故轉報亦多。電報一經接轉，稽延時刻，誤傳電碼，在所不免。若採用直列式，一電路可接續五局以上十局以下，德美法瑞西等國，更有接續十局以上十四局以下者，彼此直接通報，毫無障礙，則無用轉報手續之必要。不但人手與材料，可資節省，且報務上之迅速與正確，實增加無比。</p>
<p>（四）廢止帮電：查在外國四百英里以下之電路，所用莫爾斯機，大都不用帮電。因電路上各局所接續者，均係直列式，殊無設置帮電之必要。該項帮電於管理上，頗爲困難，於經濟上無甚利益。且製造電報機時，因須適於帮電應用起見，工價較貴，其繼電器抵抗、定爲二千歐姆，需用電力較多，創設費與維持費均大，殊非經濟之道也。</p>
<p>以上近述，係直列式之優點，亦卽並列式不及之點。現交通部所轄各電局，均次第改爲直列式，紛紛呈報通暢異常。此在我國通信制度上足可紀錄者也</p>
<h3>最摩登·最經濟的社交…………交際電報</h3>
<p>— 顧仙</p>
<p>海外交際電報的成績，已由寄然先生説過了，（見上期本刊）我亦感想到我國的（交際電報）在（社交時代化）之下，確有提倡的必要，略述　陋意見，以供獻於我大多數的民衆們；</p>
<p>我國以前雖無（交際電報）之名，而實有類似之酬應電報，例如軍閥，官僚·政客·較高資産階級，以及所謂名流們，用以（慶，弔，）之電報是也，但是電文多半是駢四麗六的文辭，乃由秘書先生們，絞盡腦汁做出來的，所謂（頌揚得體），或由（酬世錦囊……中郎枕秘等等），套襲來的，此種文字，未免太腐化，太貴族化了，且受之者，如其是軍政要人，發電者爲平常脚色，或係泛交，曁隸屬，則不過由熟悉電碼的職員，摘一個由，登簿而已，全文都無暇繙譯了，實在太無意義。</p>
<p>因爲電報價目太昻，以前普通民衆，利用它來作交際的，可謂（寥不數覯）甚且一部分人們，不常用電報通信，偶然接到一封，有出門人在外省的，總恐怕是不祥消息吧？交部有見及比，故提倡交際電報）犧牲减價，極力招徠，以備公開應用，雖然行之未久，民衆們對它缺乏相當認識，而我以爲收受，及發寄（交際電報），的人們，必須有下列數點的信仰，及普遍的利用方可；</p>
<p>（一）收受（交際電報）最多的人，當然是社會上聞望最高的人，海外政治家之就職，科學家之誕辰，一種事業的成功，學術上的驚人發明，或探險家的失敗，犧牲性命，等等，其本人或家屬，莫不收受無量數的（交際電報），以顯出多數人的公意（慶祝，或哀悼），以比例彼，吾國社會人士，對此當然須有澈底認識曁信仰，尤其是我們智識階級，應予首先提倡實行，以示文化之並不落伍社交之（時代化）啊！</p>
<p>（二）發（交際電報）與對方的人，無須認識，或係戚友之必要各國皆有先例，譬如我們對於他和她，有相當信仰，或欽慕，能有致（敬意）的機會時，就可拍發一電，且無論對方是團體，是個人，都可以發的，就像一個藝術家，胡蝶女士，及大名鼎鼎的梅博士，要到京滬了，我們渴慕他和她的藝術，以及前年新詩人，徐志摩的死，我們非常惋惜，就可以發一個交際電報與其本人，或家屬，去慶祝，或其他，凡可慶弔的事，都可利用交際電報啊！</p>
<p>（三）（交際電報）的電文，决不可用（四六）的爛套，古文式的筆調，最好須用切於實際而表示相當（悃愊）的話來説；</p>
<p>（例一）Set（標識）常州青菓巷，陳天驥先生，恭祝畢業，前途的光明，陳言歌（此電共二十字，計洋四角）</p>
<p>（例二）Set（標識）上海哈同路（一三四）號，馬士清兄邱涵秋女士，新婚快愉，王德馨張藴蘭支。（此電共二十三字，計洋四角六分，假使二人攤之，每人僅用洋二角三分）</p>
<p>（例三）Set（標識）北平恊和醫學黄先生旭初，報載，閣下研究細菌學，有相當發明，爲全人類慶，河南醫藥公會，（此處共三十二字，計六角四分）</p>
<p>（例四）Set（標識）西安竹桿巷，九號，王容儕先生家屬，王先生仙逝，爲社會同深哀悼，陳震亞住（此電其二十六字計洋五角二分）</p>
<p>（例五）Set（標識）察哈爾宋主席，轉抗日陣亡將士追悼大會，爲民族爭光榮，乃後死人的楷模，安徽合肥縣農商兩會各法團等同叩，（此電共四十六字計洋九角二分）</p>
<p>（例六）Set（標識）杭州魯主席，閲報，政躬不適，謹祝不日康泰，以慰省民之望，平湖公民嚴仲珊叩（此電共三十二字，計洋六角六分）</p>
<p>（交際電報）交部規定，來去電文，均由（局，臺），免費代譯，地名住址，及人名，不逾十五字者，作五字計算，惟外加Set（交際電報標識）一字之費，不論本省隔每字收費二分，惟每電以二十字爲起碼。價廉效宏，讀者不妨一試吧！</p>
<h3>半月消息</h3>
<p>— 社友</p>
<p>改良長途電話候話室　交部以各電話局或電報局附設之長途電話，近來營業頗爲發達，發話人往往因話綫無空或守候受話人答話，須在候話室守候甚久，常感無聊不舒，茲爲改善候話室設備起見，特通令各電話局及電報局，飭將長途電話候話候話室佈置雅潔，並酌備報章雜誌，以供發話人憇息瀏覽，藉利業務云。　　製定電話傳遞洋文電報簡易對照表　自交部創辦電話傳送電報以來，各大商埠之商行均與電局利用電話傳送電報，旣極迅速，又甚便利。惟傳送洋文電報時，往往因商行方面管理此項事務之人員，不諳英語·或讀音不準·以致時有傳送錯誤情事。交部茲爲便利商民，免除錯誤起見，特製定電話傳遞洋文電報簡易對照表一種，卽將每一英文字母規定一數目字與之對照，遇字母讀音不清時，可改唸數目字，卽可辨知確係某一字母。此項對照表各商行可向各電局電臺免費索取云。</p>
<p>修訂官車電報收費及限制辦法　交部以十八年五月修正之官軍電報收費及限制辦法迄今實行已五載有餘其中條文與現在狀况頗多不適於用，故最近又加以修正，呈奉行政院轉奉國民政府指令照准，現交部已將此項辦法通令各電局臺遵辦。再此項辦法本社印有單行本，函索卽寄。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我們需要歐化</h3>
<p>— 戈人</p>
<p>前日，看到某君一篇論歐化的文字，他的意思，以爲我國文學内容貧弱，缺乏生命力，應從西歐文學儘量學習，他的意見大體是正確的。眞正的（歐化），必不止於穿西裝吃大菜，這在東方幾個較退化的國家特别要感到。在俄國革命以前，許多文人就憧憬西歐文明，屠格涅甫就是個徹頭徹尾的西歐主義者，在日本，由歐洲文學深湛涵養卽對東方人生活開始厭惡的廚川白村，就大聲疾呼地宣言東方文明的破産，應學歐洲生活那樣，從肉到靈。我國在最近幾十年來，可以説是處於一種急遽轉換的時代渦流之中，舊的信仰已經失效，而新的還没有建樹起來，在這青黄不接的景况中，時代社會内部的矛盾便反映在國民心理上。在先前，我們又聽到歡迎德先生和賽先生的口號了，最近二十年來的五花撩亂的思潮都可算是這口號的連續。中國社會是個半殖民地的社會，這裏面不僅包含着買辦和民族資本主義者，同樣封建勢力也還頑固地盤踞着，這是個亘古今所未有的神秘的集團，這集團中所發的思潮也就是古今中外所未有的古怪的思潮，因爲一切的主義學説到中國來都變了型。而所謂歐化也者，到中國之後也就成爲少女歌舞團，桃花江，説評話，打撲克牌，以及諸如此類的東西。儘骨外面披上資本主義的外衣，而實際上還是一個封建骸骨的迷戀者，這種現象想起來會令人毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>過去在一本小説上，看到某一個人勸一個教徒吃啤酒，説：（耶穌教是外國來的，啤酒也是外國來的，吃吃何妨？一這話驟聽起來雖有些可笑，但可代表我們一大部份人的心理，因我們接受西洋的文化就是用我們（中國方式）承受下來的。</p>
<p>至於文學，當然也只是這樣，從事文學者是我們比較開明的一羣，而現在，竟有許多人用新感覺主義作爲招牌而描寫紅樓夢一樣的内容了，關於這，我們有什麽可説？形式是新頴的，標點符號一樣不缺，印刷就許是最道地的横排，如果是新詩，還用着和外國一點不差的節奏韻律與分段。然而内容…這却管不了，因爲我們正在進行（歐化），而這就正是（歐化）！</p>
<p>一切的事物，一切的學説，不從深處去發掘是没結果的。淺淺的沙灘上也只能建造粗陋的茅棚，而不能支持一個擎霄大厦。（歐化）的結果，使我國産生了許多冒牌的學者和鍍金的名流。今後整個民族，應從眞正的改革做起，我們需要（歐化），然而我們需要拿批判態度接受下來的有血有肉的（歐化），而不是表面上淺薄的模倣，單就文學而言，南歐人生活之流動活潑，北歐人生活之嚴肅深刻，所表現於文學上的，都是爲我們借鏡，而成爲這古老骯髒虚弱的民族之興奮劑和血清劑，我們要（歐化），爲什麽不捨棄了那些物質享受而從這裏入手呢？</p>
<p>我們是需要（歐化）的，作爲一個民族一分子的人，應當嚴肅的思考，精鋭地判斷，向（歐化）的路上走去，而把自己生活和那些虚僞歐化了的麽登公子的生活分爲兩個壁壘！</p>
<h3>安慰</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>在一個大病臨危的人的跟前，你如果滿不在乎的對他説：（這病是不大要緊的，大約只要再服一二帖藥，就會好的了。）那他自然安心許多，或許致死的病，眞的會由這二句話的安慰，而得到漸行恢復健康的效果，也説不定；要是你將病的危險性，老老實實的説出來，他就不死於病，恐也要爲焦急煩燥所迫死了。一個窮途潦倒，四面碰壁的人，處處受人家的奚落和鄙棄，對於人世漸起了倦厭之念，而急於走上自殺的路：這時，你如果很誠懇的對他説：（急什麽，像你這樣的人，總不會窮苦了一世的。你還是暫時忍耐着，或許明天也會得過快活日子過過！）這麽説後，最好再舉出三二個歷史上的英雄的身世，來做個例，他至少會把死的念頭放棄了。</p>
<p>人是需要一點兒安慰的。安慰對於一個走頭無路的人，的確像一帖提神藥一樣，有一種意想不到的力量。假使人間世没有（安慰）這回事，人生也許會失掉了不少的光彩。不過，安慰也只足以解救眼前煞那間的困窘而已；要以（安慰）爲活命的至上靈丹，而在奉着不放手，那就糟了可惜我們的同胞，就多犯着這（死奉着不放手）的毛病。</p>
<p>我們的同胞，大約是聰明透了的，深曉得（安慰）的功效是這麽大，每當着危急的時候，得不到人家的安慰，也常會自己來安慰自己一下子。做爲我們中國人的典型的阿Ａ，當被人家侮辱毆打時，就以（兒子打老子）來安慰自己，這段事實，想是誰都熟悉的了（其實，阿Ａ並不是别人，原來就就是我們自己。）像他這麽一來，精神的勝利是得到的了，但是，侮辱毆打還是依舊捱手着，甚且，最後更免不了得個殺頭的收塲</p>

<h3>President Wang Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Only Exchanged Opinions on the North China Issue; Huang Yin Still Remains in Guling to Confer with Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang, together with Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, arrived in Nanjing at 7:30 AM on the 15th aboard the Hai Rong warship. Ye Chucang, Chu Minyi, Chen Bijun, Chen Xunyong, Wang Shouyan, and others were all at the naval dock to greet them. After disembarking, Wang immediately returned to the official residence of the Ministry of Railways to rest, then attended the Central Political Conference and went to the Executive Yuan to handle official duties. Wang said that Huang and Yin were still in Guling to confer with Chairman Chiang due to unfinished matters. They will leave for Beijing after discussing in detail with Chiang. Rumors that Huang is being passive are untrue. The central government has begun preparations for convening the Fifth National Congress, and the central government has also decided on the venue of the congress and notified the party headquarters of all provinces and cities to prepare everything. Rumors that the number of Central Committee members in the Fifth Congress will be changed must be discussed at the Fifth National Congress, and cannot be decided by one or two people. Currently, the number of Central Committee members is based on special circumstances at the time, so whether the number of members in the Fifth Congress will be changed should be decided by the congress. (15th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During this time, Wang Zhaoming, Huang Fu, and Kong Xiangxi successively went to Lu Mountain and met many times. Although the scope of the discussions was broad, they only exchanged opinions and conducted research. After Wang returns to Nanjing, he will solicit the opinions of other Central Committee members before submitting them to the Standing Committee for selection. Furthermore, Xiong Shihui and Zhang Qun, chairmen of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, met with Chiang and Wang in Lu Mountain to report on the administrative situations of the two provinces, the aftermath of bandit suppression, and the severity of the summer drought, requesting relief measures and earnestly requesting the central government to find ways to provide assistance. It is heard that Wang, Chiang, Kong, and others are paying close attention to this issue. Developing water conservancy, controlling grain, replanting drought-resistant crops, and providing work relief are all being planned. (15th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang and Chen Shaokuan left Guling at 8:00 AM on the 14th and went to Xunyang. At 10:45 AM, they took the Hai Rong warship eastward from Xunyang and arrived in Nanjing at 1:00 AM on the 15th. Because it was inconvenient to disembark at midnight, they anchored at Dashengguan. At 7:00 AM on the 15th, they weighed anchor and arrived at the naval dock in Xiaguan at 7:30 AM. The naval department had been informed in advance and sent a military band and marines to the dock at 5:00 AM to be on alert. They also ordered the Jiesheng and Suisheng shuttle boats to dock and be ready for use. Chen Xunyong, the Navy Vice Minister, and Wang Shouting, the Commander, arrived at the dock early to arrange everything. After a while, Ye Chucang, Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, and others arrived at the dock one after another to greet them. Before the Hai Rong warship arrived at the naval dock, it anchored in the middle of the river. Chen Bijun, Chen Xunyong, and Wang Shouting immediately took the Jiesheng shuttle boat to board the warship to greet them. Wang exchanged brief greetings with the greeters and then disembarked and boarded the Jiesheng shuttle boat to transfer to the naval dock to disembark. The Hai Rong warship fired a 19-gun salute in salute. After Wang arrived at the dock, he took a car with Chen Bijun amidst the welcoming sounds of the military band and went into the city to rest at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways. Then, at 8:00 AM, he went to the Central Party Headquarters to attend the Central Political Conference, and then went to the Executive Yuan to handle important official matters. Wang told reporters that he went to Lu Mountain at the invitation of Mr. Chiang to speak to the students of the military officer corps and to discuss everything at his convenience. After arriving in Lu Mountain, he immediately visited Chiang. Because Chiang was busy with summer work and had recently felt slightly unwell, the meeting was very simple. He then went to Haihui Temple to speak to the students of the military officer corps. This year's military officer corps is larger in scope than last year, and mid- and high-ranking military officers from various regions have joined the corps for training, with excellent results. When returning to Guling, Huang Yinbai had already gone up the mountain. It was originally planned to have another conversation with Chiang and Huang, but Chiang still needed to rest for several days, so most of the items prepared for discussion were omitted. He only briefly talked with Chiang and Huang. Wang continued, saying that the North China issue is nothing more than resolving various trivial matters within the war zone, implementing them according to the original plan to reduce the suffering of the people in the war zone. It is not true that Huang is being passive. Huang is still in Guling because he has something to discuss with Chiang, and he will leave Guling and pass through Nanjing to return north after discussing in detail with Chiang. The reporter then asked about the recent situation of the preparations for the Fifth National Congress. It is said that because the Fifth National Congress has been postponed twice, according to the general regulations of the party, it cannot be postponed again. The central government has begun preparations and notified the party headquarters of all provinces and cities to prepare everything. As for the topics to be discussed at the congress, the central government has now decided on (1) the proposal to convene the National Assembly, (2) the proposal to amend the general regulations, (3) the proposal to promote party affairs, and (4) the proposal to determine the policy direction. Regarding financial problems, the current situation is very difficult, but we are very concerned about the disaster situation in various provinces and hope to find ways to provide universal relief. The military suppression of bandits in Jiangxi Province is progressing extremely smoothly and making daily progress. Only a few counties remain in the bandit areas. The bandits have been severely suppressed by our large army, and a small group has fled to Fujian Province and will soon be resolved. Chen Shaokuan said that his mission this time was to report on naval affairs to Chairman Chiang. He met with the chairman several times over five days and learned that the military suppression of bandits in Jiangxi had achieved absolute victory and that the bandits could be cleared in a short period of time. According to reports from the navy, the bandit situation in Fujian Province had long collapsed. Chairman Huang has not yet confirmed when he will leave Xunyang, but he has ordered the Zhongshan warship to stop at Xunyang for Huang's use. Whether Huang will come to Nanjing and then go north, or go to other places, is still undecided. (15th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Summoning Rice Merchants for Discussion</h3>
<p>Discussing Ways to Curb Rising Rice Prices, Urgent Measures Needed to Address Grain Shortages (Nanjing) On the morning of the 15th, the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau summoned rice merchants to the Municipal Government for discussions on curbing rising rice prices.

The source of supply was limited, and although there were no immediate problems, there were concerns about panic in the autumn and winter. Foreign rice would not be purchased lightly unless the situation became extremely dire. It was also reported that after the rain in the past two days, rice prices had decreased by 10%. A request had been made to various banks to release funds or for the Beijing Municipal Government to raise funds for resale to grain merchants, and to build warehouses to prevent the disruption of rice supplies next spring.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Current Secondary Education System</h3>
<p>This newspaper recently published a responsible interview with an important official of the Ministry of Education regarding the recent new developments in secondary education. The core of the interview can be divided into three points: first, the secondary education system; second, the allocation of secondary education funds; and third, the common graduation examination for ordinary middle schools. I still remember that in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic, after the League of Nations Education Survey Team came to China to conduct a survey, their criticism of the shortcomings of Chinese education was quite pertinent, and their criticism of Chinese secondary education was even more thought-provoking. I also deeply felt that there was indeed a need to reform secondary education. However, after studying it, I found that their views were not entirely the same as those of the official of the Ministry of Education. However, due to space limitations, I cannot fully express my views, so I will first discuss the current system. The current secondary education system is a system in which middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools stand side by side. If we want to criticize the inappropriateness of the content of this system, we should first briefly understand the previous system. According to the changes in the education system in our country since the founding of the Republic, it is impossible to enumerate them all. In May of the 17th year of the Republic, the First National Education Conference resolved the school system diagram and its explanation. In the same year, the Provisional Regulations for Middle Schools were also promulgated. Both stipulated that junior middle schools could set up various vocational courses as needed by the locality, and senior middle schools could also be divided into general and agricultural, industrial, commercial, household affairs, normal, and other vocational courses. At the Second National Education Conference in April of the 19th year, not only was there no attempt to change the regulations of two years ago, but special attention was paid to the establishment of vocational high schools. The period between the First and Second National Education Conferences was almost no less than two years. If, as the official of the Ministry of Education said, the system of merging middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools implemented at that time would cause confusion in various educational facilities and divergent purposes, why did so many education experts attending the conference not see this and insist on making the mistake again and again? We must know that the system of the 17th year of the Republic did not force middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools to merge. It was even more obvious in its intention to specially approve the establishment of agricultural, industrial, commercial, normal, and other subjects as independent senior vocational schools. Moreover, if a secondary education system can truly integrate the strengths of the three into one, allocate them appropriately, and apply them properly, as evidenced by the current situation of secondary education in the major powers, it does have the advantage of making it easier for students to transfer and is suitable for developing their personalities. Then, even if it is thoroughly implemented, what harm is there? The current system separates ordinary middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools and establishes them independently, which is similar to the middle school system in Japan in the first year of Showa (the 15th year of the Republic). However, Japanese education scholars such as Yoshiiwa Matsuura have strongly criticized it. Mr. Yoshiiwa believes that "to completely regard ordinary middle schools and vocational schools as things of different nature...is really no longer suitable for the needs of the times, but only a meaningless concept that is divorced from real life." Therefore, he vigorously advocated that middle schools adopt the elements of vocational schools, and vocational schools absorb the strengths of middle schools. (See the original "Theory of Middle School Reform in Japan") He also pointed out that the Weimar Constitution of Germany stipulates that "the composition of public schools should be based on adapting to the needs of various occupations." And secondary schools in the United States also have a tendency to gradually change from general personality education to vocational education. That is, the Japanese Ministry of Education, in view of the domestic and foreign trends, also finally revised the middle school regulations in January of the sixth year of Showa (the 20th year of the Republic). Vocational education was implemented in middle school education. In a five-year middle school, from the third or fourth year, it was divided into two parts: one for further education and one for not. The part that does not go on to further education is either agricultural, industrial, or commercial, which is clearly no different from a vocational school. Even the part that goes on to further education still has vocational courses to cultivate national work habits and productive knowledge. Even if ordinary young people can enter university and study liberal arts, they should also have their hands trained accordingly. Therefore, to regard middle school as a preparatory institution for purely higher education, and to make the majority of students who regard secondary education as their final education unable to take the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills of their actual lives, it is also clear that it is an argument that does not conform to the trend. All of this is enough to prove the current measure of dividing the secondary education system into three and making further education the sole purpose of ordinary middle school education is a mistake. Now, let's take a step back and look at reality, leaving aside theory. With the lack of well-run universities and specialized schools in our country, on the one hand, we want to seek strict enrollment in national universities and specialized schools, and on the other hand, we use the common examination system to deprive some high school graduates of the opportunity to participate in further education examinations. As a result, there will inevitably be many high school graduates who drop out halfway, and most of the knowledge they have learned in the past will be thrown away. It can be seen that the ideal of the official of the Ministry of Education to use ordinary middle schools as "stepping stones for the study of advanced academics" can at best be realized only in part. Moreover, students often fail to enter university due to changes in their own interests or the pressure of family circumstances. The government is not omnipotent, how can it guarantee that middle school students will be able to continue their studies until graduation, and after graduation, they will be able to go on to further education and will want to go on to further education? Then, there is no doubt that the current system is not as good as the previous system of "horizontal and vertical activities." If you don't believe me, try to look at the following two resolutions of the joint conference of teachers and staff of Jiangsu Provincial Middle Schools held on June 1st of this year, and you will be even more aware: (1) High school, junior middle school, and students of various vocational schools have changes in environment or interests, and those who are willing to go on to further education and serve should be remedied. (Resolution) 1. In the current first grade of junior middle school, elective courses in vocational fields should be set up so that students can study. 2. Elective courses should be set up in the current first and second grades of high school and vocational schools to meet the needs. 3. Please ask teachers to set up remedial schools for remedy. (2) Starting in the 23rd year of the Republic, provincial schools will promote production education, tighten up ordinary middle schools and normal school classes, and vocational schools will not recruit students, but there are more and more junior middle school graduates who have difficulty going on to further education. Can the meeting ask the Ministry of Education to designate the original schools to add vocational training classes, or can vocational schools enroll both boys and girls to avoid students' regrets? (Resolution) Passed. The new system has only been implemented since the 21st year of the Republic, and the voices calling for remedy have already reached our ears. Looking at this request, it is directly contrary to the expectations of the Ministry of Education. However, compelled by the times, how can it be said that it is not legitimate? The intention of the Ministry of Education may be to say that this is a phenomenon during the transition period and should not be overemphasized. Once vocational schools and normal schools are expanded considerably, and ordinary middle schools are strictly restricted, students whose interests are biased towards normal or vocational subjects may not gather in the ordinary middle school as they do today. However, I don't know that the expansion of vocational normal schools and the reduction of middle schools are often blocked in fact, and it is even more difficult for elementary school graduates of twelve or thirteen years old to determine the interests of their personalities when they are preparing to enter secondary school as the standard for further education. Even wise parents, elder brothers, and benevolent teachers will not be able to give their advice. How about the government? As for students who change their original intentions due to changes in the environment, there is no need to discuss it. It can be seen that this is a permanent difficulty, not just a phenomenon of the transition period. It can be seen from this that the current system is not as good as the previous system. The criticism of the previous system by the official of the Ministry of Education is not the fault of the system itself, but the fault of the failure to implement it properly. Moreover, there are many middle schools in the past that did not implement the previous system. It is also not appropriate to attribute the failure of the entire secondary education to the errors of the previous system.</p>
<h3>Tragic Drought in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) In Zhejiang Province, various unfortunate phenomena such as suicide, rice grabbing, water grabbing, famine, selling children, exchanging food, and waiting for death from starvation due to drought have been difficult to describe. Moreover, there have been tragedies caused by farmers' superstitious prayers for rain. In the past, there was the shooting of farmers by the magistrate of Chongde County, and the destruction of the county party headquarters by farmers in Jiangshan. Recently, Xu Yihong, the 60-year-old principal of Dumei Elementary School in Yuyao, was beaten to death by angry farmers for trying to dissuade them from welcoming gods and praying for rain. Natural disasters have led to man-made disasters, and I shudder when I think about the future. The fermentation of the stinky wind tide in Hangzhou, all fecal workers will stop working from the 16th. It is heard that because the official efforts to prevent and persuade, and promised to temporarily collect a monthly fee of a corner from residents, slightly make up for the losses, the proposal to strike has been cancelled.

<h3>Japanese Instigate Puppet Regime to Arrest Russian Personnel</h3>
<p>Stationmaster and Twenty Employees Claimed Evidence of Conspiracy Found Hirota Indicates Willingness to Mediate</p>
<p>(Harbin) Recently, attacks and derailments have occurred frequently on trains on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The (Manchukuo Government) suspects that there must be a conspiracy behind this, and arrested the suspects for serious investigation. As a result, conclusive evidence of an anti-(Manchukuo) conspiracy has been obtained. On the evening of the 13th, the stationmaster of Yimianpo, Bi Yazhaifu, and twenty other Soviet Russian employees were arrested. At the same time, many bombs and secret documents were found during a search of the residences of various employees. They not only attempted to derail trains, but were actually a group engaged in large-scale anti-(Manchukuo) movements. Several of the arrested employees were radio technicians, who had important obligations to contact various groups to carry out the conspiracy. The Manchukuo authorities are scheduled to escort them all to Harbin on the 17th to begin formal interrogation. (Fifteenth Dispatch from the Japanese League) (Tokyo) Today, someone asked the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the arrest of more than thirty people because the Soviet Russians were plotting to assassinate a large number of Japanese (Manchu) officials. He replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unaware of this matter and that this type of incident was not related to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, he said that the arrest of the Russians was likely the result of the recent attacks on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway by (bandits). Japanese military trains and escorts have suffered heavy losses. None of the Japanese newspapers carried the news of the arrest of the Russians. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters) (Harbin) Today, (bandits) again dismantled the tracks 20 miles west of Hengdaohezi and ambushed them. When the train derailed, the (bandits) opened fire, but fortunately no one was hit. One locomotive and twelve train cars were completely destroyed. After looting the cars, the (bandits) also abducted the officials in the cars. Traffic between Harbin and the departure point is temporarily suspended. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters) (Harbin) The Manchukuo ship Yingkou, which set sail from Hulin, passed the Didazuizi of Qijiluo, downstream of Harbin, at 8:00 p.m. last night, when 30 bandits disguised as passengers suddenly drew their guns and began to rob, forcing the crew to stop the ship. The bandits who were waiting nearby also took small boats to the Yingkou, intending to kill all the Japanese on board, causing great chaos on the ship. Sakaguchi, the Tiger Forest Garrison Guidance Officer, fought bravely and shot three bandits before being killed due to running out of ammunition. Iw永Shizuo, the Tiger Forest Counselor, also shot several people and then swam away in an attempt to escape. His whereabouts are still unknown. In addition, Takeyoshi, a Japanese official on the ship, also killed two bandits and was seriously injured. The whereabouts of two other Japanese are currently unknown. The Japanese and Manchu women on board were all robbed and abused. Two Manchu crew members and one American were killed by gunfire, and 30 passengers were kidnapped. The bandits left the ship at 1:00 a.m. this morning, and the remaining crew members arrived in Harbin at 10:00 a.m. The ship was full of corpses, and blood was flowing everywhere, which was unbearable to see. (Fifteenth Dispatch from the Universal News Agency) (Tokyo) Negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway suddenly encountered a reef with the return of (Manchukuo) representative Hashimoto to China. Unless the Russian side expresses a willingness to make concessions, the negotiations cannot break free from the state of stagnation. However, Foreign Minister Hirota believes that there is still hope for the negotiations to succeed because the Russian side has not yet submitted a final proposal. If Russia and Manchukuo request the Foreign Minister to mediate again, he will not hesitate to conduct political negotiations again. (Fifteenth Dispatch from the Japanese League)</p>

<h3>Japan Undecided</h3>
<p>Still needs to observe the attitude of various countries in the preparatory meeting (Tokyo) The most important issue at next year's naval disarmament conference is the issue of abolishing the Washington Treaty. The Japanese government has already decided on fundamental countermeasures through the Five-Minister Conference and has recently decided on the following countermeasures based on this policy: (1) The Washington Treaty, which stipulates the 5:5:3 naval ratio, is incompatible with the Japanese government's belief in disarmament, which is to abolish the ratio system. Japan advocates abolishing this treaty and ensuring the security of national defense in a free position. (2) Since the policy of abolishing the treaty has been determined, the procedure for announcing the abolition will be carried out at the most appropriate time in the future. There is no need to immediately determine the time. The government will temporarily wait and see the attitude of various countries at the preparatory meeting. (United Press dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Department</h3>
<h3>Bidding for the Construction of Warships</h3>
<p>Four cruisers, fourteen destroyers, and six submarines (Washington) The U.S. Navy Department today invited bids for the construction of four cruisers, fourteen destroyers, and six submarines. Any shipyard, whether commercially operated or operated by the Navy Department, can bid. In the future, the project will be divided between public and private shipyards. The four cruisers were approved by Congress in 1929, and the funds will be allocated from the Navy's regular expenses in 1935. The submarines and destroyers are being built according to the legislative bill, which aims to make the strength of the U.S. Navy equal to that permitted by the convention by 1934. The Public Works Administration will raise funds for this warship construction project and will provide the Navy with $40.7 million to build these destroyers and submarines, improve the Philadelphia Naval Aircraft Factory, and build aircraft. One of the cruisers currently planned to be built will be an 8-inch gun type and cannot begin construction until January next year according to the London Convention. The other three are 6-inch gun types, each with a maximum displacement of 10,000 tons. Among the fourteen destroyers, two are 1,850 tons, and the rest are no more than 1,500 tons. The six submarines are each 1,500 tons. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th) (Washington) Congressman Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, announced today that a five-year naval aviation plan has been submitted to the review committee for research. Mr. Vinson's plan is very innovative, advocating that the government manufacture aircraft to compete with private companies because private companies make huge profits from contracting government aircraft, which has long been attacked by Congress. Therefore, Mr. Vinson advocates that the government immediately build its own aircraft manufacturing plant in Philadelphia and expand the scope of the Pensacola Naval Flight Training Field. Mr. Vinson seems unwilling to discuss the issue of the naval ratio between Britain, the United States, and Japan, but he said that he is against changing the provisions of the Washington Treaty before January 1, 1936. (National Telegram on the 14th) (New York) In the first six months of this year, the export value of the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry reached $5,898,000, with a total of 146 aircraft and 454 engines sold. Among them, Germany purchased 8 aircraft, 177 engines, and some parts, with a value of $1,566,000. In 1933, it was only $348,000. The Soviet Union, Colombia, Mexico, and France followed in order. The list is as follows: The Soviet Union purchased a total of 107 engines, worth $637,000; Colombia purchased 16 aircraft and 12 engines, worth $573,000; Mexico purchased 20 aircraft and 26 engines; France purchased 2 aircraft, worth $45,000.

<h3>Key German Government Figures</h3>
<h3>Continue Propaganda to the People</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Neurath delivers a speech General Mackensen makes a public announcement to the people (Berlin) Today, government officials made a radio broadcast for two hours to ensure that the results of the plebiscite on August 17 show that the public unanimously approves the cabinet's decision to have Prime Minister Hitler concurrently serve as President of Germany. In order to allow everyone to listen to their speeches, the government has specially provided a large number of radio sets to remote villages so that those who have not heard radio broadcasts can now listen to them. All the speakers unanimously urged the public to vote in favor on Sunday. All newspapers also carried General Mackensen's announcement to the people, saying that this plebiscite is not comparable to an election competition because there is no opponent to Hitler today. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th) (Berlin) In the matter of the German people's referendum on Hitler's concurrent position as President, Foreign Minister Neurath has also joined the expanded propaganda campaign. Mr. Neurath's speech tonight requested the people to stand behind the government, saying that the public's vote this week is not a domestic issue but an important event related to Germany's international future. One of the most important points of Germany's foreign policy is to restore its equal status because Germany has suffered countless contempt and damages in the international community since being bound by the Treaty of Versailles. The reason for this is that Germany's disarmament and loss of equal rights are the root cause. Therefore, Germany cannot demand the restoration of equal rights. Leader Hitler is a leader who is determined by the national will to restore equal rights and protect honor and freedom through peace. Therefore, we must unite and stand behind our leader Hitler as a whole, showing the world that Hitler's aspirations and demands are the aspirations and demands of the entire German people.

<h3>Hindenburg's Will</h3>
<p>Believing that the imperial system is easier than the republic Want Hitler to inherit his vacant position (Berlin) It was learned today that President Hindenburg's will, regarding political aspects, contained the belief that the imperial system is easier than the republic and clearly stipulated that his vacant position should be passed on to Hitler. This will has been personally delivered to Hitler in Berchtesgaden by Hindenburg's confidant Papen, who went to Vienna yesterday to make a palace memorial, and will be officially announced tonight. This will have a considerable impact on the national referendum on August 19 on Prime Minister Hitler's concurrent position as President. Regarding the restoration of Germany, the original content of Hindenburg's will stated that "in this troubled time, the Kaiser dynasty will be the mainstay." The will does not explicitly advocate restoration but expresses his personal confidence in the Kaiser to resume governing the country. The will is dated May 11, 1934, and is four pages long, recounting the events from 1919 to the time the will was written. Regarding his past opposition to National Socialism, Hindenburg said that his various differences with Hitler had to be reconciled at the time, but he was pleased to appoint Hitler as Prime Minister. The last sentence of the will stated, "I want my Prime Minister to be my successor." (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>

Previously, some people said that the Prince intended to go to Riccione, saying that the Prince's visit there was intended to have a second meeting with the Prime Minister. It is now known that this statement is not accurate. The Prince only intends to stay in Venice for one or two days before returning to Vienna. The purpose of Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg's visit is roughly to prepare for the meeting between the two Prime Ministers. Prince Starhemberg must have returned to Austria by the time the Austrian Chancellor arrives. Italian troops will begin exercises on August 19. The Italian Prime Minister and ministers will all go to watch the exercises until August 24. The day Schuschnigg arrives in Italy will be when the Italian troops are conducting exercises. Mr. Schuschnigg will only meet with the Prime Minister in the province and will not go to Rome. The purpose of Prince Starhemberg's visit this time is to prepare for the meeting between the two Prime Ministers. The Austrian Chancellor will inform Mussolini of various news. This trip is of great value to Italy because some people say that the Austrian government is currently collecting files to prove Germany's responsibility in the Vienna incident on July 25. Now, independent Austria is represented by the Schuschnigg cabinet. Mussolini will express to Mr. Schuschnigg his firm desire to maintain Austria's independence. However, it is not yet known in what way Italy will help Austria in fact. However, the general public believes that the meeting between the two Prime Ministers will fundamentally decide on this matter. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Saar Increases Police Force</h3>
<p>The League of Nations can approve it (Geneva) Knox, Chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, today requested the recruitment of foreigners to increase the Saar police force from the original 1,000 to 3,000 because the referendum is about to be held and the police force must be increased to maintain order. Knox described to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations the recent incidents encountered by the police, indicating the difficulty in dealing with the National Socialist Party, saying that the recruited police must be recruited from member states of the League of Nations that speak German. Therefore, only people from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, and Switzerland can apply. However, due to political relations, the new police will only be filled by people from Switzerland and Luxembourg. The Saar Governing Commission mostly agrees with Knox's opinion, but some committee members believe that all political groups in the Saar should cooperate to maintain order during the referendum. According to reports, the National Socialist Party has the most influence among the political groups in the Saar. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th) (Geneva) It is heard that the Council of the League of Nations will definitely approve the request of Knox, Chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, to add more police officers. Although the Swiss government is worried that the recruitment of police officers in Switzerland will have an impact on Swiss-German relations, it does not want to oppose it, acknowledging the necessity of ensuring a fair public referendum. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th) The Saarbrücken Saar District Council held a meeting today. After reading an important protest letter, the German avant-garde members withdrew as a whole. The German avant-garde group is the largest organization in the Saar district that unites German people, and the Saar Governing Commission is quite discriminatory towards it, leading to the recent search of the avant-garde office and confiscation of its documents. The withdrawal of the avant-garde members from the council is a sign of opposition to the commission's various oppressive acts. The protest letter they read expressed indignation at the recent insults of the former German head of state Hindenburg by the separatist newspapers and recognized that the commission's handling was inappropriate. Although the court ordered the return of the documents from the avant-garde office after they were confiscated by the commission, the commission still insisted on not complying. Therefore, the members protested even more, and they reiterated that if this matter is not properly resolved, they will petition the League of Nations. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>Qian Zhen praises</p>
<h3>British Judicial System</h3>
<p>Leaves England for Belgium today (London) Qian Zhen, Vice President of the Chinese Judicial Yuan, has recently completed a thorough investigation of the British judicial system and left office today. During his stay in England, Qian visited the Minister of Justice and the President of the High Court and visited various criminal and civil courts, village courts, police courts, and prisons. Qian is scheduled to leave England for Belgium on August 16 and then go to the four countries of the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Italy. In the future, he plans to return home via the United States. Today, Qian told a reporter from the North-China Daily News that he has a very good impression of American judicial affairs, especially because the British system respects tradition and the customs of the people, and Britain is prepared to make laws that suit the wishes of the people. This is really necessary for the implementation of justice. Qian also said that the system of circuit judges is good, and he believes that China should also adopt this system because China is vast, and this is the only way to reach everywhere. He intends to apply to the government to implement this system. Qian also praised the jury system but doubted that it would be applicable to China. Qian also praised the American police court system, saying that he has had the privilege of sitting in court to observe the trial several times.

<h3>Roosevelt</h3>
<h3>Calls for Monetary System Meeting</h3>
<p>One million dollars in gold transported to Paris (Washington) The White House held an important monetary system meeting today. President Roosevelt and Federal Reserve Director Black and New York Federal Reserve Bank President Harrison held a closed-door meeting for two hours. Mr. Harrison has just returned to the United States from Europe. During his time in Europe, it was repeatedly reported that he had consulted with European bankers on issues such as currency stability and debt. It is said that Mr. Harrison has now reported to the President in detail on the impressions he gained from informal talks with banking leaders in Europe. After today's meeting, rumors that Black had resigned were also discussed, but this could not be confirmed. (National Telegram on the 14th) (New York) The American Trust Company today tried to transport some gold to Europe. This is the first gold export since the United States redefined the value of the dollar. Several batches of gold recently shipped to the United States have now been transferred to ships for export to Amsterdam and Paris. It is believed that the U.S. government's permission to export gold is a legitimate expression of monetary authority, and the fear of inflation should be slightly reduced as a result. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th) (New York) A trust company here announced that it will transport a batch of cash worth one million U.S. dollars to Paris tomorrow for direct exchange. Financial figures here interpreted this move as an expression by the Treasury Department to maintain the price of gold at $35 per ounce. (National Telegram on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Operates in the Far North</h3>
<p>(TASS dispatch from Murmansk, July 15) Murmansk is a newly rising Soviet city located outside the Arctic Circle. Its population has increased from 8,800 in 1926 to 80,000 today. Over the past ten years, a complete water supply project has been built here, and one theater, power plant, and large-scale mechanized bakery have been established, along with several hotels and other buildings. The fishing industry here is becoming increasingly prosperous. Before the war, the fish caught off the coast of this port was only 100,000 ständern, but in 1933 it was 1.3 million ständern. At the same time, since the discovery of the Northern Sea Route and the opening of the Baltic Sea-White Sea Canal (connecting here with Leningrad), the commercial status of this port has become increasingly important. The investment in the fishing grounds here from 1929 to 1934 was 12.5 million rubles, and the number of fishing boats increased from 23 to 75. The fishing grounds here are equipped with complete sales stations, nets, and fish salting stations, cold storage, canning factories, and other ancillary businesses. A ship repair factory has also been built, the first part of which has been completed. The equipment is the latest. At the same time, the construction of new docks has also begun. The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates that 190 million rubles will be invested in the fishing grounds here for development. By 1937, the catch will increase to 2.8 million ständern. At that time, Murmansk will become the largest industrial center in the Far North. (TASS dispatch from Arkhangelsk, July 14) The fuel industry in the Northern Region will be greatly developed during the Second Five-Year Plan period due to the rich coal in the Northern Kula Region and oil in the Ukhta Region and will become the fuel base for the industry of Murmansk, as well as the fleet of the White Sea and Barents Sea and the coal stations of the Northern Sea Route. Coal production in the region will reach 1,350,000 tons by 1937, and oil production in Ukhta will be 75,000 tons. The technological restructuring of the timber industry and the construction of new factories are the main economic problems in the region because the region accounts for a very large share of timber exports. The total investment amount of the Second Five-Year Plan is 1,110 million rubles, of which 58.3 million is used for industrial construction.</p>
<h3>Spanish Deposed Prince</h3>
<h3>Buried in Austrian Country Cemetery</h3>
<p>Gonzalo, the fourth son of the Spanish deposed King who died in a car accident in Possdschak, Austria, was buried in a country cemetery at 11:00 a.m. today. The coffin was covered with flowers and escorted by a team of Catholic Sturmkorps. Austrian President Miklas and Fey accompanied the Spanish deposed King and Queen to hold the funeral ropes. The deposed Queen and her two daughters cried very sadly. The deposed King Alfonso also shed old tears and could not bear his grief. (National Telegram on the 15th) The fourth son of the Spanish deposed King Alfonso, Gonzalo, who died in Austria, was buried here today with royal honors at the wish of his mother. Austrian Interior Minister Fey participated in the funeral on behalf of the Austrian government. In addition, a large team of the Home Guard and a company of the standing army joined the honor guard. Many dignitaries from Spain and France came here to hold the funeral ropes. The mother of the deceased was so grief-stricken that she could barely walk. If the deposed King had not supported her when the coffin entered the tomb, she might have fallen to the ground. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th) And as much as 390 million rubles was used for the timber industry. The district will add six sawmills and 29 sawing machines. Sawing production will increase from 3.46 million cubic meters in 1932 to more than 6 million cubic meters. A large-scale paper mill will be built in Syktyvkar, Komi Autonomous Oblast, with an annual output of 80,000 tons of writing paper and 8,000 tons of wrapping paper. Arkhangelsk is building a paper mill. The fishing industry will be greatly expanded. In 1932, the catch was 11,000 tons. In 1937, it will be 35,000 tons. The population in the Northern Region has increased rapidly in recent years, and cultural construction is remarkable. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the number of students in higher technical schools in the region increased from 160 to 1,600. The number of students in higher education institutions increased from zero to 1,000. The number of technical schools increased from 3,700 to 15,000. The number of students in workers' schools increased from zero to 3,000. The number of students in junior high schools will increase to 442,000, the number of higher schools to 6,000, and the number of higher technical schools will increase to 20,000. Moscow will hold</p>
<h3>International Revolutionary Movement Conference</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The International Revolutionary Movement, since its last meeting six years ago, will reconvene here in late summer this year. The exact date has not yet been announced. At a time of dramatic changes in the world's social and economic situation, the conference will discuss the easiest ways to overthrow capitalism. The meeting will be held in the newly completed Kremlin Grand Hall. Representatives from all countries with a Northern Communist Party will attend. Although the number of people with formal voting rights is only two to three hundred, the number of attendees is expected to be as many as fifteen hundred. The meeting will be held in secret, and the outside world will only know about it through informal talks with the attending representatives and official statements published in Soviet Russian newspapers. It is likely that Dimitrov, who was tried by the National Socialist Party for arson in Berlin, will report on the progress of European fascism and how to counter it. In addition, the chairman of the conference, Manuilsky, will report on the success of Soviet Russian socialist construction and the problems encountered. Manuilsky's report will be of great interest because there was a fierce debate at the last conference as to whether socialism can be built in one country or whether it must be carried out simultaneously throughout the world. Trotsky argued that it could not be done in one country alone, while Stalin argued that it could. As a result, Trotsky was expelled, and Stalin took sole control of Russian politics. Now, how the Soviet Russian achievements will be welcomed by representatives from various countries is also noteworthy. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<h3>Yellow River Breach in Changyuan</h3>
<p>Fields in Fengqiu Territory Submerged. A Communication from Kaifeng: The Yellow River flooded last year, and it has been over a year now. During this long period, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the river affairs bureaus of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces have been busy repairing and blocking dikes. The general public believed that this year's autumn flood could be safely passed. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 11th, the flow of the Yellow River Bridge in Zhengzhou rose to 12,700 cubic meters per second, only 1,300 cubic meters per second less than during last year's flood. On the afternoon of the 12th, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission suddenly received a report stating that a breach occurred between Menggang and Dacheji in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, at 2:00 PM. Initially, it was only two feet wide, but by about 5:00 PM, the water was torrential, scouring over fifty feet, and both manpower and materials were lacking, making it difficult to carry out emergency repairs. At the same time, on the north bank of the Yellow River in Tonghuxiang, Lanfeng Territory, water also surged out, flowing into Fengqiu County, inundating areas such as Wangwan and Dongwangzhuang. The water depth on the flat ground was three to four feet, and people fled as their fields were submerged. At 11:00 AM today, the reporter went to the River Affairs Bureau to visit Director Chen Ruzhen. Coincidentally, Section Chief Wu of the bureau and the technical officer of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission were preparing a car to inspect Lanfeng. Furthermore, Hu Yuanhui, a member of the Hebei Provincial Government who arrived in Bian yesterday, also telephoned Chen, requesting to inspect the breach site. According to Chen, a report on the emergency repair situation at the Changyuan breach has not yet been received today. The water in Fengqiu overflowed from the dikes built by the former China International Famine Relief Commission in Lanfeng, which were washed away last year. However, it is only in the beach area and not a major concern. However, the Xiaonanbeidi dike at Leiji, on the south bank of the Yellow River in Lanfeng Territory, was in extreme danger on the 11th because several hundred Zhang Wugu bandits had infiltrated the vicinity, and gunfire was intense. Over a thousand dike workers fled in panic. The water was less than a foot from the dike. Fortunately, the cars transporting emergency materials dispatched by the River Affairs Bureau arrived, and the workers were gathered to exert all their efforts to protect the dike, which finally stabilized. Although the dikes within the province have been heavily scoured, there is absolutely no danger of a breach if sufficient manpower and materials are used. However, if the Changyuan breach is successfully blocked, the narrowness of the river channel in Shandong Province may cause problems. Recently, a telegram from Shaanxi stated that the Luo River and Jing River have both risen sharply. This morning, the Yellow River at Zhangguan rose another seven inches, and it is expected to reach Bian by tomorrow afternoon. (13th)</p>
<h3>No County in Jiangxi Province Is Free from Disaster</h3>
<p>Farmers in Various Counties Despair and Commit Suicide. Workers in Ganzhou Petition for Rice Price Stabilization. The Provincial Government Purchases Foreign Rice for Relief. A Communication from Nanchang: Since the beginning of summer, the province has not had rain for nearly two months. Except for the six counties in southern Jiangxi that are still being harassed by bandits, almost every county has reported a disaster. Among them, the drought in northern Jiangxi is the most severe, while southern Jiangxi is relatively less affected. The tragic conditions in various disaster areas are unbearable to describe. For example, the Duchang County government telegraphed the Provincial Relief Association, stating that the drought in the county was unprecedented in sixty years. The early rice harvest was less than 20-30%, and the late rice crop was completely hopeless. Miscellaneous grains could not be replanted to compensate. The disaster victims filled their stomachs with lake grass, ferns, and Guanyin clay (a type of white soil). More than ten people died because they were not accustomed to eating these things, and more than ten people committed suicide due to suffering. Yugan County also had no harvest, and the disaster-stricken farmers had no means of livelihood. It is unknown how many more committed suicide. Mo Xiong, the administrative commissioner of the fourth district of Jiujiang, telegraphed the provincial government, reporting that the counties in his district were all severely affected by the disaster. Among them, Jiujiang County was the worst. The farmers in the county, because there was no hope of a harvest and their livelihoods were cut off, were resentful and committed suicide. The matter is currently being investigated and preventive measures are being taken. Yushan County borders Zhejiang Province, and the rice seedlings have all withered. In the future, the only way to compensate will be to plant miscellaneous grains, but there is no source for seeds. Therefore, County Magistrate Wang Zhen, together with local organizations, has initiated fundraising to purchase seeds and has first advanced 10,000 yuan from the county government to purchase buckwheat seeds. Rao Cixiang, a disaster investigator who had previously reported the disaster in Leping County, recently reported that the early rice harvest in districts 1, 7, and 8 of the county was at its best, 70%, while districts 7 and 6 were only 30-40%. If there is water to supply the late rice crop, there is still a glimmer of hope. Furthermore, the Wanzai County Magistrate telegraphed that the late rice crop had no yield and requested a postponement of the land tax. A visitor from Linchuan said that the county had planted less than 20-30% of the late rice crop this year, and the rice that was planted was withering due to the ponds and rivers being drained dry. The hard work and sweat invested in it had all gone to waste. On the western side of Jiangxi, a visitor from Yichun saw cracked fields and withered rice plants along the highway. Even in the four suburbs of Nanchang, the lakes and harbors had cracked. The seedlings of the late rice crop that had not been planted were burned with fire, and the ashes remained. The severity of the situation is evident.</p>
<p>In this city, unscrupulous merchants hoarded rice and manipulated prices, causing the price of rice to skyrocket to 14 yuan per dan (unit of weight). The workers in various industries, whose daily toil and sweat were insufficient to make a living, repeatedly petitioned for the suppression of rice prices to no avail. Therefore, on the 13th, 2,000 workers from various industries at the wharf formed a procession to petition for the suppression of rice prices. They first went to the Provincial Party Headquarters, where they were received by Secretary-General Hu Yunhong. Xu Zheren, the director of the various industry associations, and others handed over a petition and stated all their grievances. Hu agreed to convene a meeting with the rice industry. The workers then went to the provincial government, where they were received by Director Gong, who addressed the petitioning workers. He said that last year's harvest was considered good, but this year there was suddenly a rice shortage. Naturally, a small number of unscrupulous rice merchants were manipulating prices and taking advantage of the situation. In order to suppress the price, the government had prepared 100,000 yuan to purchase Saigon rice and transport it to the province. All other requests were also within the realm of possibility, and the government would do its best to find a way. The petition is as follows: (Since the beginning of summer, this province has experienced a prolonged drought, and the rice seedlings have withered. There is no hope of a harvest. The disaster area is vast, covering almost the entire province. Furthermore, unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to hoard goods and drive up prices. Recently, rice prices have continued to rise. If the rice prices are not suppressed and the high prices are not stopped, it will not be a measure to protect the people and maintain social tranquility. The disaster area is vast, and there is also concern that the late rice crop will fail. In the spring and summer of next year, a dangerous situation is bound to arise. It seems that we should prepare well for relief measures to ensure that we can safely overcome the rice price crisis. We have drafted two types of temporary and permanent solutions as follows: A. Temporary solutions: (1) Confiscate the grain and rice stored by various rice merchants and establish several official sales outlets. (2) Stipulate the price of rice from this year until the new grain enters the market next year. (3) Establish 30 subsidized rice distribution points. (4) If any unscrupulous merchants hoard rice and fail to report it, or if it has not been sealed, confiscate it and severely punish them. B. Permanent solutions: (1) Allocate funds to improve water conservancy. (2) Raise funds to relieve the rural areas. The above temporary and permanent solutions are urgent provincial affairs, and we hereby submit them to you for your review and approval. They are truly in the public interest.) (August 13th)</p>

<h3>Disaster Relief Committee Appeals for Aid</h3>
<p>And Submits Proposals for Disaster Relief. A Communication from Anqing: Anhui Province has been suffering from a prolonged drought, and a disaster situation has already developed. The two counties of Huaining and Tongcheng are particularly affected. The extreme heat and lack of rain have lasted for two months, and the food problem of the people is becoming increasingly serious. The provincial government has organized a People's Food Regulation Committee to regulate the food supply and as an initial step for disaster relief. Efforts are also being made separately for drought relief and disaster relief. As for the drought situation in various counties, the provincial government has recently received reports from various counties: (1) The situation is still very serious in the following thirteen counties: Huaining, Wangjiang, Tongcheng, Ningguo, Zhizhi, Guichi, Dongliu, Langxi, Dingyuan, Lai'an, Quanjiao, Jiashan, and so on.

The white Broach cotton for April-May rose 0.25 to 131.25 rupees. ▲Liverpool Cotton: Prices rose in the Liverpool cotton market today. The price for October was 6.95, 3 pounds higher than yesterday's closing price. ▲Liverpool Wheat: Prices fell in the Liverpool wheat market today. The price for October was 5 shillings 9 pence 25, 2 pence 25 lower than yesterday's closing price. ▲New York Wheat: The wheat market opened lower this morning, as expected. The price for September fell 1.375 pounds. ▲New York Grains: The grain market also fell by 1 pound today.</p>
<h3>Rubber</h3>
<p>▲London Rubber Market: The London rubber market was quiet this morning. At noon, the trading price for October-December was 7.5 pence, 0.0625 lower than yesterday's closing price. ▲New York Rubber Market: The New York rubber market was quiet today. The opening price was the same as yesterday's. There were no changes before noon.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>▲New York Securities: The favorable factors for the market situation before the opening of the New York securities market were (1) the Ministry of Finance now allows gold exports, and (2) government bond market prices are strong. The unfavorable factors for the market situation were (1) the Chicago steel industry's business decline of 2 pounds to 29%, and (2) the instability of the prices of major commodities. When the securities market opened this morning, the market situation was stable, and the prices fluctuated very little. There is currently a lack of momentum. The inflationary sentiment is gradually cooling down. It is expected that there will be no major changes in the securities market situation for the time being. The metal industry (the age of iron) reported that US steel production is currently at 22% of its production capacity, due to reduced demand for tinplate. As a result, the work of tin factories has decreased from 65% to 52%. The industry has abandoned the hope of a turnaround in August, but still hopes for a real improvement in September, because the inventory will be empty at that time and needs to be replenished, which can promote progress and is more effective than the government's special plan.

<p>County, Wuwei, Shucheng, and so on. (5) The disaster situation has slightly improved in Chuxian County. (6) The following thirteen counties can be expected to be safe: Fuyang, Yingshang, Woyang, Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, Suxian, Fengtai, Haoxian, Wuhe, Qingyang, Taiping, Wuhu, Dangtu, and so on. In addition, no reports have been received from the following six counties: Fengyang, Lingbi, Sixian, Taihe, Huoshan, and Qimen. The Provincial Disaster Relief Committee is now sending telegrams to overseas compatriots and charitable organizations, appealing for aid. It has also prepared proposals for disaster relief and submitted them to the provincial government for consideration and implementation. A partial transcript is as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram Appealing for Aid from the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee: (Natural disasters are rampant, and the drought demon is raging. The land is scorched, and the crops have withered. Coupled with years of banditry and repeated floods, the wounds have not yet healed, and famine has struck again and again. Anhui is the most severely affected. As a result, incidents of looting rice, grabbing food, fleeing, and committing suicide are heard every day. Some families flee, while others await death behind closed doors. Kitchen smoke has ceased, and villages and hills are filled with cries, which are heartbreaking. Recently, disaster reports have been received from more than forty counties. The vastness of the disaster area is unprecedented in a century. The governor is anxious above, and the officials are rushing below. The state has no sudden stockpiles for famine relief, and the local governments and the public are in a state of financial ruin. Discussions on relief are met with empty treasuries, and talk of subsidized rice distribution is met with a lack of grain reserves. Stopping services and reducing meals cannot solve the problem. Anhui is located near the capital area, and its security is of utmost importance. If there is even one call for help at night, how can there not be fear in the five gates? Campfires and lonely cries are a cause for concern everywhere. Although the polders and highlands are different in situation, the Jiangnan area is also suffering from poor harvests. Even though exaggeration and concealment are equally to blame, reports of poor harvests are still feared. The severity of the situation is self-evident. The members of our committee are always worried that our efforts are insufficient and know that it is difficult to report. Even a cup of water is thought of as a tide, and a withered raft in August wants to float to the sky. However, we are carrying a heavy load and acting lightly, and our strength is small but our wishes are great. We respectfully ask you, gentlemen, to have compassion and be accommodating. Whether your loyalty is deep and respectful, or your feelings are deeply felt for the starving, reducing one day of luxurious meals is no different from helping the orphans in all directions. Moving the needs of the white gold platform is better than building a seven-story pagoda. Turning the sea of suffering into a sweet road is only due to one compassionate thought. Taking the house of fire out of the blue lotus, why begrudge thanking you nine times? We hope you will show mercy and listen to our plea.)</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Proposals: (1) Please implement the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law promulgated by the National Government. The Wang system says, "A country without nine years of savings is considered insufficient; a country without six years of savings is considered in a state of emergency; a country without three years of savings is not considered a country." Three years of cultivation must provide one year of food, and nine years of cultivation must provide three years of food. With thirty years of communication, even if there are severe droughts and floods, the people will not have to eat wild vegetables. There is no better policy for storing food against famine than this Reserve Fund Law. It is also this idea. As Chao Cuo said, "Accumulate more and prepare in advance." The law is good and the intention is beautiful, and it seems appropriate to follow it. (2) Please refer to the special telegram from Nanchang on July 23rd in the Ta Kung Pao. Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi stated that the drought in Jiangxi was severe and telegraphed the central government, requesting 1 million yuan to provide relief. The situation in this province is the same, and we propose to telegraph the central government, requesting an appropriation of funds to subsidize and relieve the disaster. (3) Last year, the National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee entrusted the China International Famine Relief Commission with handling 11,800 tons of American wheat for agricultural relief in Anhui, with an amount of about 890,000 yuan. This wheat was originally allocated by the central government for agricultural relief in Anhui. Now, as a major disaster has struck this province, we propose to telegram the National Government and instruct the competent authorities to order the commission to temporarily allocate half of it to be used for urgent drought relief purposes. The commission is handling hundreds of thousands of yuan for agricultural relief in Hubei Province, and Hubei Province has already requested that it be returned for urgent relief purposes. (4) The market price of rice has increased dramatically, and there is a fear of rice shortages everywhere. In the Spring and Autumn period, Lu was hungry and sought grain from Qi, and Jin was hungry and begged grain from Qin. Borrowing grain from neighboring countries is recorded in history. We propose to suggest to the central government to purchase rice from rice-producing countries that have always been friendly neighbors, such as Siam, to relieve the rice shortage in the country. This matter concerns international affairs, and we ask you to consider whether it is feasible. (August 13th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang Education Association Requests Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhetian Ascending Grain Embezzlement Case: This county's Zhetian Ascending Grain Embezzlement case has solid evidence. It has been repeatedly reported by the county party headquarters, citizen Zhang Shiqia, Wu Baohuang, a supervisor of the provincial education funds management office, and Zhu Zhaosheng, director of the county education bureau. It is secretly investigated that the circumstances of this case are fragmented, and the relationship is significant. It is a major case of embezzlement by custodians unprecedented in Jiangsu Province. In the past, in the era of autocracy, even the slightest bit of importance was known for the collection of land tax, and no difference of even a fraction of an ounce was allowed. How dare you take advantage of the opportunity to reduce the collection of Zhetian Ascending Grain, and encroach on the land tax to the amount of more than 100,000 yuan at the time of Qingtiian Bairi and vigorously implementing integrity? If the law and discipline are not thoroughly investigated and severely punished, how can we promote the rule of law and warn corruption? This association cannot bear to sit back and watch the county's education expenses being encroached on. Therefore, it was submitted for discussion at the second meeting of the directors. It was decided that the evidence in this case is solid and the circumstances are serious. It should be telegraphed to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Nanchang Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, the Provincial Government Finance Department, and the Education Department, requesting a thorough investigation and strict investigation to declare the national law and warn corruption, etc., recorded in the minutes. In accordance with the former case, in addition to telegraphing, the original text of the report by Zhang Baozhi, Wu Baohuang, Zhu Zhaosheng, etc., published in the Shen Bao is attached, and the telegram is sent to Your Excellency for a thorough investigation and strict investigation to declare the national law and warn against evil. It is indeed convenient for officials and the public. Changwu Gan Shen Fuyun of Songjiang County Education Association kowtows.</p>
<h3>Salt Police Beaten to Death</h3>
<p>Xuantan Temple near Tinglin is stationed with an anti-smuggling team, specializing in arresting smuggled salt. A few days ago, the stationed team reported that a smuggled salt boat was parked within the territory of the 19th Tu. The team sent a salt policeman to secretly investigate. Unexpectedly, the salt boat, relying on its large number of people, beat the police to death and threw them into the river to eliminate traces, and then sailed to another place to escape. The Tinglin Public Security Bureau heard about the incident. Since it concerned human life, they sent a team to pursue and arrest them. They saw the smuggled salt merchants packing their luggage in a certain place, as if they were abandoning the boat and fleeing. When they saw the police arrived, they knew that they had been discovered. The merchants swam away. The police were unable to catch up and only captured a boat woman, who was taken to the bureau for interrogation. Wuxi</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Appeal for Relief</h3>
<p>Xin Yi and other 21 silk factories in this county had disputes over the improvement fee issue that have not yet been resolved. Now it is learned that the factories, due to the current silk industry crisis, are becoming more and more serious, and in order to seek survival in death, they have put forward three opinions: 1. (1) Please present to the government to designate the Central Bank (China Communications Bank) to set up a special silk industry loan office. All factory silk mortgages should be slightly more, and silk stocks should be allowed to wait for the opportunity so as not to compete and depreciate, which would harm the industry. (2) It is heard that a part of the silk industry relief bonds issued by the government in the past has not yet been issued. Should we request the government to issue all of them and distribute them to the factories? If there is not enough, can we request the issuance of new bonds again? The method and amount should be discussed and decided by the government, together with people in the silk industry. If a few colleagues have other intentions and obstruct them, the government should strictly stop them. (3) The Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Fee is implemented by the provincial government's order. At a time when the central government is abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes, Jiangsu Province suddenly has this kind of illegal, unreasonable, and unfair act. People in the Wuxi silk industry cannot bear it. They have filed an administrative appeal in accordance with the law, requesting the central government to revoke the provincial order. The process is currently underway and no substantial results have been obtained. Can the silk industry colleagues in Shanghai take the same action to help each other? One, yesterday (15th), I sent a letter to Mr. Shen Huachen, a leader in the Shanghai silk industry, asking him to make a high call to maintain the silk industry.</p>
<h3>Dam Demolition Dispute Eases</h3>
<p>The desolate Weiba near Chenshu Town on the border of Xicheng was demolished by Zhou Weisan, the head of Gushan Town in Cheng County, without authorization. After being repaired by the residents of Chenshu Town, the residents of Gushan Township intended to rebuild it, resulting in endless disputes. The Construction Bureau of this county specially sent technician Xu Chuzhen, together with Zhao Hongbin, the head of the sixth district, to conduct an inspection. Unexpectedly, they were attacked by the residents of Gushan Township, who gathered and beat them, and dragged them to the boat to measure the river channel of Gushan. When the boat reached the halfway point, the residents of Gushan Township knew that things were not good, so they turned back to Chenshu. The residents of Chenshu Town were extremely angry because they were outnumbered and went on strike together to show their resistance. Later, County Chief Yan of Houshan telegraphed District Chief Zhao to persuade the merchants, and they resumed business at 3:30 pm that day. District Chief Zhao has now returned to Xicheng, and Technician Xu is still in the countryside. During the chaos, Mr. Xu lost a briefcase containing three official documents, which have not been found yet. The dispute must be resolved by the two counties of Xicheng through consultation. The cause of the dispute was that the residents of Gushan Town were bewitched by Feng Shui and demolished the dam. It was not a matter of drought and water flow. The dam was also demolished by the residents of Gushan Township during the sixth year of Xianfeng in the late Qing Dynasty and was repaired by the residents of Chenshu Township, causing a lawsuit. As a result, Gushan lost the case and was finally settled. Kunshan</p>
<h3>Experimental District Loans to Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Zhu Wenyuan, the chief of the Luxiabin Autonomous Experimental District in this county, in view of the drought and lack of rain in this district for the past ten days, the rice seedlings in the fields are gradually withering. If we do not seek relief urgently, if the autumn harvest is hopeless, the rural economy will be unduly affected. He specially drafted fundamental relief measures and submitted them to the county government for approval. (1) The total amount of the loan is 23,000 yuan. (2) The original famine relief fund of 15,000 yuan in this district is 4,000 yuan short, which will be borrowed from Anting Cooperative at interest. (3) There are a total of 44 villages in the entire district. Each mu of rented land planted by tenants will be loaned 5 jiao, and so on. However, the loan per household will be limited to a maximum of 10 yuan to show the restriction. (4) The date of payment is from August 6th to 15th. (5) The monthly interest rate is 8 li. (6) The term is five months. If the notice is returned on time, the chiefs of each village will notify the farmers in each village to collect the loan from the district office for days, which is quite crowded. Nantong</p>
<h3>Cotton Crops in Tongshu Suffer from Prolonged Drought</h3>
<p>Cotton crops in Tongshu counties and coastal reclamation areas have been damaged due to drought. Fortunately, there has been heavy rain recently, and the yellow flowers are blooming. It is estimated that the autumn harvest is expected to be 60%. The Cotton Improvement Association has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations to estimate the output of new cotton this year. Zhenjiang</p>
<h3>Yingchang Factory Workers' Strike Re-emerges</h3>
<p>The Yingchang Match Factory in Zhenyi had a major labor dispute due to the dismissal of workers. After mediation by the party and government, it resumed on August 1. Unexpectedly, yesterday the factory believed that 18 members of the trade union, including Wang Fulin, had beaten the factory director, and issued a notice to dismiss Wang and others. At that time, when the workers heard the news, they were extremely frightened. Those who beat the factory director were Luo Xiaolian and others, and others did not intervene. How could they be punished innocently? They surrounded the factory and asked the factory to withdraw the order to maintain their lives and respect the workers' movement. However, the factory did not answer. The workers were unwilling to leave the factory and slept in the factory. The situation was serious for a while. The military and police sent teams to the factory to investigate. After receiving the report, the party also sent personnel to guide the situation, but there was no result. Yangzhou</p>
<h3>Giant Thunder Kills Cattle Herder</h3>
<p>Wang Yilian, a villager from Xiyuzhuang, north of Zhaoguan Dam in Yishu, makes a living by farming. His grandson, Xiao Bazi, 19 years old, was leading cattle to graze in the wild the day before. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly changed, and dark clouds rose everywhere. Suddenly, there was a loud noise. Xiao Bazi was riding on the back of the cattle at the time, and both the human and animal were struck to death by lightning at the same time. The situation was quite tragic. Gao You</p>
<h3>Case of Extorting Fees in the Name of Disaster</h3>
<p>Two Township Chiefs Detained: The case of Bai Changqing, the former head of the sixth district, who was long rumored in this county for extorting fees in the name of disaster, has been reported to the province by the county government, and the Civil Affairs Department has transported him to the Zhenjiang Local Court for interrogation. The county government had previously received an order from the department to send the relevant township chiefs, Qin Xuecai, etc., to the province. After receiving the order, the county government yesterday sent police to detain the two township chiefs, Qin Xuecai and Hu Yue, to the county. Township Chief Qin Fengzhen has fled without a trace. The county government has ordered the police to step up the search so that everything can be sent to the province for investigation and handling. Danyang</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Corps Kills Bandits</h3>
<p>A group of strangers suddenly came to the entrance of the Self-Defense Corps in Wan'an Town, the eighth district of the county, and wandered outside, looking suspicious. The sentry of the gate paid close attention to the secret investigation and saw one person carrying a towel-wrapped package, looking flustered. He reported it to Squad Leader Jie Ziqing, who immediately led the Self-Defense Corps to investigate. They heard the sound and fled to the opposite side of the Jiuqu River. As a result, only Wu Jinbiao and Zhou Yicheng were arrested. A pistol, many bullets, and other items were found in the package. They confessed in the corps headquarters that they were all from Jiangbei and intended to rob the Self-Defense Corps of its guns. After obtaining the confession, the corps sent members Lin Rongxiao and others to escort the two criminals to the city. When they arrived at Linjiaqiao, because of the hot weather, they chose a shady place to rest. The bandit Zhou Yicheng thought he had an opportunity to take advantage of. He secretly pulled out the box cannon worn by Lin Rongxiao and shot to escape. Lin was startled and raised his hand to compete with each other. The corps member also used a gun to fight back in self-defense. The bullet hit Zhou Yicheng's vital point, and he died on the spot. Wu Jinbiao was immediately sent to the county, interrogated by Xu Cheng, and ordered to be detained. Personnel were sent to the county together with the inspection officials to conduct an inspection. Hangzhou</p>
<h3>Young Men and Women Commit Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>At 12:00 pm on the 11th of this month, the Huanhu Hotel on Hubin Road in Hangzhou City had two young men and women travelers from Shanghai, dressed in fashionable clothes. The male guest claimed to be Si Songchao from Shanghai, and the woman was his wife. They opened room number 49 and stayed in the hotel. They went out to visit the West Lake for days, and talked and laughed as usual. Unexpectedly, the night before, they wrote two letters and went to bed for a while. They did not get up until the next noon. The waiter called the door but did not answer. He broke the window and went in. He saw the men and women lying on the same bed, their faces pale and strange. He knew they had been poisoned and quickly reported to the police station and sent them to the hospital for treatment. The man died as soon as he arrived at the hospital, and the woman also died at 2:00 pm due to severe poisoning. The court reported the autopsy and coffin. There were two letters left behind, one to his friend Zhenhua in Shanghai borrowing 20 yuan, and the other to the hotel explaining that they committed suicide due to economic pressure.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Passenger Car Runs Over Rural Woman</h3>
<p>Tu Li, a woman from Tujiacun, near Xiaoshan Linpei, 43 years old, went to Chen Jiaxi's tin shop in Aozhuang with four female companions yesterday morning to get tin foil. Passing through Bailutang, the 10:00 am express train from Linpu to Xiaoshan on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway came galloping. Li could not avoid it and was run over to death. The corpse was crushed into three sections, which was extremely tragic. Her husband, Tu Qingchao, was informed and led his children to collect the body. The railway bureau gave a condolence payment of 20 yuan and the matter was over. Yuyao</p>
<h3>Party Committee Prevents Praying for Rain</h3>
<p>Xu Yiqing, the principal of Yuyao Doutun Elementary School and a member of the Party Committee, was killed by farmers. He tried to dissuade farmers from welcoming gods to pray for rain and aroused public anger. At 5:00 pm on the 12th, he was beaten to death by more than a thousand farmers and thrown into the river. He was then salvaged ashore, his throat was bitten off, and his head was split open with a weapon. It was unbearable to witness. The county government party headquarters reported the incident the next morning and sent personnel to investigate and arrest the murderers. Haimen</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Private Opium Secretly Transported by Sea</h3>
<p>It has been two months since this county established a Tobacco Prohibition Committee and implemented tobacco prohibition measures. However, the Tobacco Paste Shops that sell official opium have not yet been established. The opium used by smokers is all private opium. Therefore, opium dealers are extremely active. Every day, when the Shanghai shipping line arrives at Haimen, a large amount of opium is unloaded. The transportation plan is very careful and difficult to detect. A few days ago, Huang Zhisan, a famous opium dealer in Xiasha, purchased dozens of barrels of oil from Shanghai, two of which were filled with opium. They entered through the new port, and the local water and land police team did not notice it at all. The amount of imports into other ports such as Qinglong, Lingdian, and Weisongji every day is also alarming.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Request the Abolition of Flower Bag Donation</h3>
<p>The Qidong Cotton Industry Association stated that when cotton is exported from the county, the county government collects 1 jiao for education fees and 8.8 li for guard fees, which is called the flower bag donation, and its nature is similar to a transit tax. Moreover, in addition to the cotton special tax collected at the factory, this item of donation tax is collected again, which is a duplication and is excessively detailed. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the two ministries of Finance and the Provincial Government Finance Department, ordering the county to abolish it in order to relieve the merchants of Jiangsu. Bengbu</p>
<h3>Salt Merchants and Banking Industry</h3>
<p>The dispute will not expand: The Huaiyan transporters in this port competed in paying the car and sea salt tax in July and August last year by the five banks of China, Shanghai, Communications, Jiangsu, and Xingye. Only half of the more than 80 trains arrived in Bengbu. Now, the bank interest on this salt is accumulating, and there are many sources of river salt, which makes it necessary to sell car and sea salt at a loss. Therefore, a profit-sharing dispute occurred with each bank. Although the car and sea salt have not been sold in recent days, river salt is still being sold every day, which is not only unrelated to the people's food, but also the saying that the salt industry has stopped is inaccurate. Now, Huang Jingwu, director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, has been running around to all parties, and it is heard that a solution has been found, and the dispute will not expand.</p>

<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Merchants in Vietnam Present to the Central Government</p>
<h3>Promptly Conclude the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>French Government Increases Tax Tenfold After Expiration of Old Treaty: Please negotiate and renew the treaty to maintain the livelihood of overseas Chinese. After the expiration of the old Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty in the 18th year, the French government promulgated new tax regulations, which increased tenfold compared with the old treaty. Overseas Chinese in Vietnam are treated harshly and suffer miserably because they are in a country without a treaty. In the winter of the 21st year, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina, Vietnam, sent representatives Huang An and Xu Yixian back to China with documents, requesting the central government to negotiate and promptly conclude a treaty to maintain the livelihood of overseas Chinese. Several years have passed, and no agreement has been reached yet. Now, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina, Vietnam, and the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty Research Association of overseas Chinese in Vietnam have jointly presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent letters to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, requesting them to forward them to promptly conclude a new treaty to benefit overseas Chinese merchants. The presented letter is transcribed as follows:</p>
<h3>Presented to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted regarding a proposal concerning the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. It is humbly submitted that our country's Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces border French-controlled Vietnam. Due to geographical and historical relations, over 400,000 people from our southwestern provinces reside in Vietnam. Trade between our country and Vietnam has always been prosperous. Vietnamese and Chinese people share similar customs, therefore, Chinese silk, tea, porcelain, paper, firecrackers, incense, medicinal materials, and all kinds of daily necessities are sold to Vietnam, amounting to tens of millions of yuan annually. Vietnamese products, mainly rice, are transported and sold to Guangdong and Shanghai in our country, also amounting to tens of millions of yuan annually, followed by coal and other miscellaneous goods. Previously, the commercial treaty between China and Vietnam stipulated that Chinese goods entering Vietnam would enjoy special preferential tariffs, which were lower than those of any other foreign country. However, since the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty expired in 1929, a new treaty has not yet been finalized. In July of that year, the Vietnamese government abolished the special tariffs for Chinese goods and applied the highest new tariffs for countries without treaties. Compared to the original tariffs, the increase was tenfold to dozens of times. For example, silk fabrics, the old tax was 1360 francs (per 100 kilograms), the new tax was 10,000 to 18,000 francs; silk thread, the old tax was 1360 francs, the new tax was 44,000 to 70,000 francs; Gu embroidery, the old tax was 3400 francs, the new tax was 14,000 to 32,000 francs; porcelain, the old tax was 40 to 125 francs, the new tax was 400 to 1200 francs; firecrackers, the old tax was 204 francs, the new tax was 1600 francs; paper, the old tax was 136 francs, the new tax was 600 to 3200 francs; tea, the old tax was 353 francs, the new tax was 800 francs; paper umbrellas, the old tax was 76 francs 5, the new tax was 2200 francs; leather shoes, the old tax was 6 francs 75 (per pair of ten), the new tax was 60 francs. (The remaining goods cannot be fully listed and will be presented in a separate table.) Since the implementation of the new tariffs, Chinese goods entering Vietnam have been greatly affected. Major commodities such as silk fabrics, Gu embroidery, and firecrackers have almost completely disappeared (please refer to the attached statistics on the import of these goods into Vietnam over the past six years). The business of overseas Chinese has fallen into a difficult situation, and many domestic industrial and commercial enterprises that previously had relations with Vietnam have also come to a standstill. In 1929, the Chamber of Commerce submitted this situation to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with a comparative table of the types of Chinese goods entering Vietnam and the old and new tariffs, as a reference for revising the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. Although the principles of the new Sino-Vietnamese Treaty were finalized in Nanjing on May 16, 1930, the treaty has not yet been implemented due to unresolved issues between China and Vietnam, as well as the failure to finalize the tariff schedule for goods traded between the two countries. During these five years, overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been without treaty protection, and many industrial and commercial enterprises have gone bankrupt. Furthermore, affected by the global economic recession in recent years, they have been unable to sustain themselves. As a result, many overseas Chinese have become unemployed and returned to China, while others have been deported by the resident government for failing to pay their poll tax, accounting for nearly half of the total number. These overseas Chinese have been away from their hometowns for a long time, and are unfamiliar with the people and places. Once unemployed and returning to China, they are penniless and find it difficult to make a living. The suffering they endure is self-evident. It is noted that the new Vietnamese customs tariff was established in July 1928 and implemented in July 1929. The tariff is divided into two types: ordinary tariff and most-favored-nation tariff. Countries that have commercial treaties with France can enjoy all or part of the most-favored-nation tariff, otherwise, they pay according to the ordinary tariff. However, all tariffs have greatly increased compared to the original tariffs. Now, the French government believes that our country's imposition of import tariffs on foreign rice has greatly affected the import of Vietnamese rice into China. People in that country believe that there is a close commercial relationship between China and Vietnam, and are eager to establish connections with each other to seek mutual economic benefits. The implementation of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty is indeed a matter of utmost urgency. Now, the newly appointed Governor-General of Vietnam, Mr. Robin, has taken office in Vietnam after arriving from France and immediately focused on handling this matter. He has specially sent Mr. Geneaod, the former Annam representative to the French Colonial Conference, to China on the 9th of this month aboard the French mail ship Athos to meet with the French Minister to China and negotiate with our government regarding the revision of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. Mr. Geneaod has consulted with the Chamber of Commerce on the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty and requested that the Chinese government promote the implementation of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. The Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter is of great importance to the personal interests of overseas Chinese, so it has convened various directors of the Chamber of Commerce, representatives of import and export merchants, and heads of various associations to form a Research Association for Promoting the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty for Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, responsible for studying this matter and submitting a proposal to our government for reference in drafting the treaty. The following is a list of the matters proposed: (1) Overseas Chinese in Vietnam have never been able to receive the same treatment as nationals of other major powers. The civil and criminal laws of the Vietnamese courts are divided into French and local laws. French law applies to legal persons and nationals of other major powers, while overseas Chinese are subject to the same local laws as the Vietnamese people. Our government should request that overseas Chinese receive the same legal treatment as nationals of other major powers. (2) Our country has established consulates in Saigon and Haiphong to protect overseas Chinese. The new treaty signed in 1930 has already stipulated this, but the various unfavorable treatments suffered by overseas Chinese in Vietnam during import and export should be requested to be improved. (3) Our country's goods exported to Vietnam (not limited to the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan) should request the restoration of the special tariffs prior to 1928 (Tarif Special). All kinds of Chinese goods not included in the special tariffs should be taxed at the current most-favored-nation tariff (Tarif Minimum) without exception. A detailed table of Chinese goods exported to Vietnam will be compiled, noting the types of goods and the old and new tariffs, and will be sent by the end of September. (4) Since Vietnam adopted the gold standard, for countries with currency devaluation, goods exported to Vietnam, in addition to customs duties, are subject to an additional exchange rate comparison tax (Surtaxe Compen Sative de Change) of 15 to 25 percent based on the cost value of the goods. Currently, Chinese goods exported to Vietnam pay the highest ordinary tariff, so there is no additional exchange rate comparison tax. However, it is heard that the resident government has predetermined that Chinese goods imported in the future will be subject to an additional exchange rate comparison tax of 25 percent based on the cost value. If they agree to reduce the import tariff on Chinese goods and compensate with other miscellaneous taxes, it will not benefit us. It should be stipulated that all Chinese goods exported to Vietnam should be exempt from this miscellaneous tax. (5) In recent years, Vietnamese customs has levied an ad valorem tax (Taxead Valorem) on imported goods, in addition to customs duties, based on the cost value of the goods, at a rate of 2, 3, or 5 percent, distinguishing between daily necessities and luxury goods to determine the difference in tax rates. Although French goods exported to Vietnam are not subject to customs duties, they must also pay this ad valorem tax. This is an internal tax that is unavoidable, but it should be stipulated that the ad valorem tax paid by Chinese goods exported to Vietnam should not exceed that paid by other most-favored nations, and no miscellaneous taxes should be levied on Chinese goods that are not levied on other most-favored nations. (6) Overseas Chinese shops in Vietnam have always used Chinese bookkeeping. A few years ago, the French government issued a clear order forcing Chinese merchants to switch to French bookkeeping. At that time, Chinese merchants believed that most of us were not familiar with French, and if we were forced to switch to French bookkeeping, it would be difficult to implement. We sincerely request the resident government to withdraw the order. This order was temporarily suspended, but the order has not been fundamentally revoked, and there is a risk of it being raised again at any time. It should be stipulated that overseas Chinese do not need to use French bookkeeping. Recall that the Philippine government previously forced overseas Chinese there to use Spanish bookkeeping, but after our country's strong advocacy, the US government issued a clear order to fundamentally revoke it. (7) Overseas Chinese education in Vietnam is restricted by the education regulations of the resident government. The regulations treat overseas Chinese the same as those in Myanmar and Malaysia, stipulating that elementary schools must teach French or Vietnamese (Vietnamese phonetics) for three hours per week, and primary schools must teach for eight hours per week. Overseas Chinese believe that students in the first and second grades of elementary school are too young to learn foreign languages, and even if they do learn in other grades of primary school, they should not occupy so many hours. The heads of various associations have jointly requested the resident government to change the regulations, but it has not yet been approved. In addition, teachers in all schools must pass the examination conducted by the resident government twice a year before they are allowed to teach. This restriction is extremely restrictive because teachers in all schools are hired from China. Even if they have graduation certificates, they still have to be examined by the resident government upon arrival. The examiners are French and Vietnamese people. Even if the examinees have talent, they may not be selected. Therefore, all schools feel extremely difficult to hire teachers. The heads of various associations have also requested the resident government to follow the previous flexible approach for Chinese schools. Teachers hired from China who have equivalent graduation diplomas from our country, certified by the Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and visaed by the local French Consul, will be considered valid and can be exempted from re-examination upon arrival. This matter has also not been approved. The above two matters are very important to overseas Chinese education and should be negotiated with France to improve them to facilitate the development of overseas Chinese education. Attached are copies of the education regulations for overseas Chinese in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia, in Chinese and French, for reference. (8) In addition to paying the regular tax (Impo Tprincipal) paid by French, Vietnamese, and other foreign nationals, overseas Chinese in Vietnam pay an additional tax (Impogradue), which is double the amount. Moreover, overseas Chinese, regardless of their wealth, pay a poll tax of 30 to 35 yuan per year (depending on the province in Vietnam, the tax rates vary; Vietnamese people also pay a poll tax of 5 to 6 yuan per year; French and other foreign nationals are taxed on their personal income, with a minimum of 15 yuan and a maximum of 90 yuan; if they have a spouse and up to six children, the tax is reduced by 10% for each person). According to French government regulations, overseas Chinese pay double the taxes and enjoy special rights, that is, the right to own property and engage in inland waterway transportation throughout Vietnam, which other foreign nationals do not have. However, French people in Kunming, Nanning, and Dongxing in our country also have the special right to lease real estate for a long term. Therefore, it is best to request the cancellation of the special taxes that our country requires overseas Chinese in Vietnam to pay. (9) According to the regulations of the Vietnamese government, the poll tax, business tax, land tax, boat tax, vehicle tax, and other taxes that overseas Chinese should pay are, in various provinces of Vietnam, divided according to the boundaries of the Chinese associations, and all members of the association are jointly responsible. For example, if one member of an association owes taxes, the resident government can pursue the head of the association (the heads of the associations are elected by the members and appointed by the resident government) and the wealthy members of the association to pay on behalf of the debtor, or use the public property of the association to offset the debt. This regulation is most embarrassing and should be negotiated with the French government for cancellation. (10) It is heard that the conditions that France is requesting from our country are to reduce the taxes on major Vietnamese exports to China, such as rice, grains, and coal. In general, when two countries sign a commercial treaty, there must be an exchange of benefits. Our government has the right to weigh and deal with this matter appropriately. (11) According to the observations of overseas Chinese, the French government is very willing to sign a Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty with our country and promote its early implementation to develop economic interests between China and Vietnam. Overseas Chinese also hope that our government will sign a mutually beneficial commercial treaty with France so that Chinese goods can restore their sales in Vietnam, and the industry and commerce of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam can be rescued from the brink of collapse. The above proposal is a brief overview of what I have seen and heard. I humbly present this insignificant contribution and request that it be adopted. Overseas Chinese here are suffering from economic oppression and are in dire straits, urgently awaiting rescue. I respectfully admire your concern for overseas Chinese, treating them no differently from domestic compatriots. I dare to intrude upon your attention and plead for the lives of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. I earnestly request that you show compassion and find a way to maintain their livelihoods, which would be a great virtue.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Joint Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese goods sold to French Vietnam were worth tens of millions of yuan annually. Silk fabrics alone exceeded ten million. However, since the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty expired in 1929, the French government cancelled the special preferential tariffs for Chinese goods entering Vietnam and imposed the highest ordinary new tariffs for countries without treaties. The tariff rate has increased thousands of times compared to the past. Chinese goods entering Vietnam have been greatly affected, and major commodities such as silk and Gu embroidery have almost completely disappeared (please refer to the attached statistics on the import of major Chinese goods into Vietnam over the past six years). On May 16, 1930, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Minister renegotiated the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, but on that day, due to unresolved issues between China and Vietnam, and the failure to finalize the attached list of goods for both sides, the treaty has been delayed and has not yet been implemented to this day. During these five years, overseas Chinese in Vietnam have not been protected by a treaty, and many industrial and commercial enterprises have gone bankrupt. Furthermore, affected by the global economic recession in recent years, they have been unable to sustain themselves. Many domestic industrial and commercial enterprises that have relations with Vietnam have also been forced to close down. Now, the French government believes that our country's imposition of import tariffs on foreign rice has greatly affected the import of Vietnamese rice into China. People in that country believe that there is a close commercial relationship between China and Vietnam, and are eager to establish connections with each other to seek mutual economic benefits. The implementation of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty is indeed a matter of utmost urgency. Now, the newly appointed Governor-General of Vietnam has taken office in Vietnam after arriving from France and immediately focused on handling this matter. He has specially sent Mr. Geneaod, the former Annam representative to the French Colonial Conference, to China on the 9th of this month aboard a French mail ship to meet with the French Minister to China and negotiate with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the revision of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. Our Chamber has submitted a special memorandum to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference in drafting the treaty. Enclosed is a copy of the memorandum to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for your review. We have always admired your association's concern for Chinese commerce and your enthusiasm for mutual assistance. We respectfully request that you petition the National Government to urge the implementation of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty so that Chinese goods can restore their sales in Vietnam and the industry and commerce of overseas Chinese in Vietnam can be rescued from the brink of collapse. Then hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese will be grateful for your association's gift. I look forward to your reply. New grain is coming on the market, and foreign rice will arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices are Trending Stable</h3>
<p>Jiangbei merchants flock to purchase abundant rice harvest. Rice stores in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are sufficient to tide over until the new harvest. Japanese rice transshipped through Xiamen and dumped into Shanghai. New grains have entered the market one after another, and foreign rice will be imported in large quantities. Rice reserves are still ample, and rice prices are showing signs of stabilizing. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency obtained detailed information from various sources, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>New Grain Enters the Market</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are both rice-producing areas. This year, due to the extreme lack of summer rain, most of the crops are hopeless. However, in the counties north of Zhenjiang, south of Huai'an, and east of Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province, such as Taixing, Taizhou, Rugao, Baoying, Yancheng, Xinghua, and Nantong, the new grains have all entered the market and are better than in previous years. The harvest is 60% better than last year, accounting for 14% of the annual harvest. The selling price is less than 9 yuan per market picul. Therefore, rice merchants in Wuxi and other places are flocking to purchase. As for the fields in the coastal and mountainous areas of Ningbo Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, the rice crops are poor. The rest are also better than last year. However, the famine in Haining and Haiyan counties is particularly severe. Rice from Anhui and Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing in Zhejiang, and Jiangyin in Jiangsu have all seen new crops. Jiaxing will enter the market within ten days. Kunshan and Suzhou will also be sold on the market within two weeks.</p>
<h3>Rice Reserves in Various Places</h3>
<p>As for the total amount of rice reserves in various places, it is estimated that there are more than 400,000 piculs of white rice in foreign warehouses in Shanghai, more than 100,000 piculs in rice shops, 350,000 piculs of new grain in Wuxi, 350,000 piculs of old grain, 250,000 piculs in Suzhou, 80,000 piculs in Changshu, 60,000 piculs in Songjiang, and 100,000 piculs in Tongli, totaling 1.7 million piculs. This is enough to supply Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and is more than enough to maintain the launch of new rice. Therefore, there is no panic about food in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Currently, with the launch of new rice and the import of foreign rice, those who have hoarded rice have gradually sold it off. However, due to the stability of the people's hearts and the lack of strong demand, second-grade rice has fallen sharply, and high-grade rice is also showing signs of weakness.</p>
<h3>Import of Japanese Rice</h3>
<p>As for Japan, in view of the rice panic in our country, it has shipped batches of rice to the military, posing as domestic rice, and transshipped it to Shanghai to avoid import taxes. As of yesterday, 1,500 bags have been imported. They were purchased exclusively by a rice shop in Nanjing. Yesterday, they were distributed to various rice shops for sale, with a quoted price of 11.5 yuan, which is similar to our No. 3 rice. However, the weight is 200 pounds, which is equivalent to 181 market catties. The price of No. 3 rice sold in Shanghai is also 11.5 yuan, but only 160 market catties. Moreover, this Japanese rice is strong and can be stored for a long time. As a result, with rice prices expected to fall, there were no transactions. It is heard that there are still 7,000 to 8,000 bags being loaded. As for 350,000 bags of Saigon rice, they can all be shipped to Shanghai by mid-September. Therefore, the future of rice prices is showing signs of weakness.</p>
<h3>Batch of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shipped from Saigon to Shanghai. More than 5,800 bags. Since the surge in rice prices, foreign merchants in Shanghai have been purchasing foreign rice from Annam to sell in Shanghai. The Saigon rice purchased by Yale Foreign Company and others arrived in a batch yesterday morning at 9:00 am on the French mail ship Athos, totaling 5,880 bags. It was berthed at the China Merchants Bureau Zhongji Wharf for unloading. It is understood that the purchase price of this foreign rice in Annam was 8 Shanghai taels. Upon arrival in Shanghai, import duties are paid as usual, with a tax of 1.65 yuan per 100 kilograms, plus a special tax of one-tenth, and a dock fee of 4%. The foreign rice was being declared and unloaded yesterday. It is understood that Connel Br and Louis and other companies that have ordered Saigon rice from foreign merchants in Shanghai have also purchased it from Annam and shipped it to Shanghai for public consumption. Therefore, the Saigon rice that arrived in Shanghai this time was not ordered by local rice merchants, but was a batch shipped by foreign merchants, the Ke An transport ship.</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai from Fuzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is said that reinforcements were transferred to Minyuan, and the people's hearts were stable. According to the Guowen News Agency, the bandits in Fujian are rampant. The following is information obtained by reporters from the navy and relevant parties:</p>
<h3>Bandits Have Retreated Slightly</h3>
<p>Recently, Luo's bandits launched a surprise attack on Shuikou, but were repelled by the Central Army. The bandits fled towards Datian Dehua and then towards Changting. To this day, the banditry near the city of Fujian is not the real communist bandits, but local bandits hiding near the city. The naval Ke An transport ship, which came to Shanghai from Fuzhou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is said that since the arrival of reinforcements in the provincial capital, the people's hearts have been more stable.</p>
<h3>Situation in the City and Suburbs</h3>
<p>The people in the city and suburbs of Fuzhou, after years of war, live far less well than they used to. All agency personnel, since the rule of the 19th Route Army, all Fujian officials have been replaced by Cantonese officials. After the destruction of the 19th Route Army, the Cantonese personnel were all removed. This time, when the provincial capital was in danger, the wealthy households in the city had already become impoverished and had no need to escape again. Those who fled to special areas were few in number. Most of those who fled were family members of civil servants, because most of the civil servants currently in Fujian Province are from other provinces.</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Commercial Bank Opens</h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo did not come to Shanghai; Jiang Baili represented the opening. More than 20 million yuan in various deposits were received in one day. Mei Zhezhi talked about the establishment of branches in Nanjing, Qingdao, and Changsha. According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, which had been closed for more than five years, was originally a government-business joint venture. It is now being restored under the direction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with branches first established in Shanghai and Hankou, and a general management office established in Shanghai. The general management office and the Shanghai branch officially opened yesterday morning. Mayor Wu Tiecheng and leaders from all walks of life went to congratulate. The total number of congratulatory guests was no less than a thousand. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The chairman of the bank is Minister Chen Gongbo, and the general manager is Mei Zhezhi, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Because Chen was unable to attend due to important official duties in Beijing, he specially commissioned Director Jiang Baili to represent the opening. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 am yesterday in the conference room on the second floor of the bank on Ningbo Road. It included: (1) paying the highest respects to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (2) reading the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (3) all bank employees bowing to the chairman and general manager to congratulate them; (4) speeches by the chairman and general manager; (5) the chairman opening the door; (6) the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3>Congratulations from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Those who went to congratulate yesterday morning included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Comptroller Zhang Chen Aitou of the National Government, Yang Dezhao representing Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Bankers Association, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou, Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, Song Hanzhang, Bei Songsun of the Bank of China, Xu Xinliu of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Ye Fuxiao of the Continental Bank, Chen Zheqing of the Y盐業 Bank, Sun Hengfu of the Siming Bank, Du Yuesheng of the China-France Bank, Jin Guobao of the Bank of Communications, and Shen Lianfang, Feng Bingnan, Yang Shousheng, Wang Boyuan, Wang Boqi, Tang Naikang, and others, totaling more than 2,000 people. The directors, supervisors, general manager, deputy managers, Jiang Danning, Mei Zhezhi, Zhang Muxian, Cheng Hejun, Yu Zhendong, Liu Fuxuan, Wu Ruiyuan, A Zhuoxian, Wang Tiesheng, Zhang Rongchu, Chen Zhuofu, Gu Junfu, Guo Mingjiu and others led the visitors to view the general management office upstairs and the various business departments of the Shanghai branch downstairs. The bank received more than a thousand gifts, plaques, silver shields, wreaths, etc., which were displayed separately in the conference room and reception room, etc., which were dazzling and spectacular.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Deposits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bank received more than 20 million yuan in various deposits. With future business development and the adjustment of the market and financial markets, a new force has been added to the banking industry. It is said that the Hankou branch of the bank also opened at the same time yesterday.</p>
<h3>Mr. Mei's Remarks</h3>
<p>AA According to the general manager of the bank, Mei Zhezhi, told a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency that the restoration of the bank, after several months of preparation, was officially opened today. Regarding the bank's business, there is not much difference from general banks, but considering its name, it will invest as much as possible in agriculture in the future to assist in the revitalization of rural areas. For this, it is planned to first conduct rural lending, but it is still in the planning stage, and all methods are still to be determined. The bank will first establish branches in Shanghai and Hankou, and then gradually develop. In the first phase, it plans to establish branches in Nanjing, Qingdao, and Changsha. In the second phase, it will establish branches in North China and South China, so that branches will be located throughout the country. The Bankers Association held a meeting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Article 9 of the Savings Law</h3>
<p>AA Article 7, all clauses guarantee genuine asset custody. It is requested that representatives from the association jointly organize a committee to submit a document to the Ministry of Finance for text revision. After revision, it will be issued to the Shanghai Banking Association. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the 54th Executive Committee meeting was held in the association hall on Hong Kong Road to discuss the implementation measures for Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law. Representatives from various member banks attended, including Xu Boming, Wang Zhixin, Liu Huizhi, Sun Jingxi, Chen Liting, Liu Hongyuan, Wu Weiru, Qi Yunqing, Huang Mohan, Wang Boyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Bei Songsun, Chen Shizhen, Zhu Huisheng, Hu Xinan, Lin Yibo, Hu Bijiang, Xu Xinliu, Chen Guangfu, Chen Zheqing, Wei Pusan, Li Fuchun, Yao Yinpeng, Wang Tianshen, Tong Xianting, Luo Qinghua, Tang Shoumin, Qu Jigang, Yue Gengrong, Jing Runshi, Zhang Zhuyu, Zhu Zikui, and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou. Chairman Chen Guangfu presided over the meeting. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou first reported on the opinions of the subcommittee regarding Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law and the original text to be submitted to the ministry. This was then brought up for discussion. The consensus was that Article 7 of the Savings Law clearly stipulates eight methods for the use of savings bank funds, which in fact serve as a guarantee of genuine assets. The rationale is clear and unambiguous. As for the provision in Article [9], that one-fourth of the total deposit amount should be equivalent to government bonds and other assets with genuine guarantees, the aforementioned eight items already constitute assets with genuine guarantees. However, proper arrangements should be made for depositing them with the Central Bank to ensure credibility. It was proposed to form a custody committee, jointly organized by representatives from the Banking Association. On the spot, it was resolved to approve the opinions proposed by the subcommittee and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and instruction. However, the drafted submission was handed over to the Secretary-General for textual revision before being issued. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. German Consul-General's Letter to Mayor Wu</p>
<h3>Condolences on the Death of Hindenburg</h3>
<p>AA According to the Central News Agency, after the death of German President Hindenburg, Mayor Wu sent a letter of condolence to the German Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, and personally attended the memorial service for President Hindenburg hosted by the German Consulate-General. Consul-General Kriebel specially sent a letter to Mayor Wu yesterday to express his gratitude. The original letter is transcribed below: "Dear Mayor, I am deeply grateful for your letter of condolence dated August 7 on the death of our President Hindenburg. I am also grateful for your personal attendance at the memorial service the other day, and for the floral wreath you sent. I will convey my gratitude to all those who sent condolences. Kriebel."</p>
<h3>British Commercial Counselor Peel to Return Home</h3>
<p>AA According to the "Zi Lin Bao," Mr. Peel, the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy in China, will return to his country with his wife at the end of this month. This trip is on a mission to tour the major industrial centers in the country to encourage British exports to China. During his absence, Mr. George will act as Commercial Counselor. Shipping companies accept the advice.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Shipping to Ruian</h3>
<p>AA Yu Qiaqing has telegraphed County Magistrate Chen Cheng to come to Shanghai immediately to discuss a proper solution. According to the "New Voice News Agency," the four shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Ruian-Pingyang line, namely Hufeng, Zhejiang, Ruian, and Daxing, believe that the Ruian County Government is solely responsible for contributing 60,000 yuan for the provincial highway shares. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Shipping Association to appeal to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, they also decided at a joint meeting that if the Ruian County Government forces them to contribute from the 16th of this month, they will unanimously suspend shipping. Now, the Chairman of the Shipping Association, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, believing that the suspension of shipping is a matter of great importance to transportation, specially summoned the managers of Hufeng, Zhejiang, and Daxing companies, Luo Yingchen, Du Desheng, and Xu Zhongxin, the other day, and persuaded them to postpone the suspension of shipping for the sake of transportation. At the same time, he also telegraphed Ruian County Magistrate Chen Cheng, asking him not to force them to contribute to avoid accidents, and requested the county magistrate to come to Shanghai immediately to discuss a proper solution. Now, the various shipping companies have accepted the advice and temporarily postponed the suspension of shipping. Therefore, all ships from Shanghai to Ruian today are operating as usual. However, as of last night's deadline, no reply telegram has been received from Ruian County Magistrate Chen, National Association of Accountants</p>
<h3>Request to Revise the General Rules for Merchants</h3>
<p>AA The National Association of Accountants yesterday submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry stating: "We have carefully examined the existing laws and regulations and found that there is a 'General Rules for Merchants,' promulgated in the third year of the Republic of China. The provisions therein all pertain to the general affairs of merchants. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Central Political Conference decided to unify the drafting of the civil and commercial codes, and thus there was no such thing as a commercial code. Subsequently, various editions of the Civil Code were promulgated, and a portion of the original 'General Rules for Merchants' was incorporated therein. As a result, the effective clauses of the 'General Rules for Merchants' are now very few. If revisions are not made promptly, it will be difficult to avoid misunderstandings in society. Moreover, civil and commercial laws and regulations are closely related to the performance of duties by accountants. Therefore, we respectfully request your ministry to forward this document to the Legislative Yuan, requesting that the invalid clauses in the current 'General Rules for Merchants' be explicitly repealed. As for the effective clauses, please consider separately incorporating them into the Civil Code or other civil and commercial laws and regulations for compliance. This would be truly beneficial."</p>
<h3>The August Issue of "Shen Bao Monthly" is Published</h3>
<p>AA The August issue of "Shen Bao Monthly" was published yesterday. To commemorate the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, this issue features two articles: "A Retrospective and Prospective View of the Great War" and "The Great War and Us." The former is a commemorative article, while the latter discusses the impact of future wars on our country. After reading, one can understand the different forms of future wars compared to World War I. Regarding the German-Austrian issue, which has recently caused a stir in Europe, this issue features "The Causes and Consequences of the Political Turmoil in Germany," "German Correspondence," and "The Austrian Coup and the Future of the National Socialist Party," providing a reference for those who are concerned about international current events. Regarding the discussion of China's agricultural problems, there are articles such as "Cotton Self-Sufficiency and Japan's Aggression Against China," "The Collapse and Self-Salvation of China's Rural Areas," "China's Rural Areas and Climate," "A Historical Narrative of Rain Seeking and Its Destination," and "A Glimpse of Rural Jiangnan," which are worthy of attention by those who care about the people's livelihood and national economy. Regarding works discussing economic issues, this issue features "What is the Way Out for China's Economy?" and "Prospects and Retrospects of Controlled Economy." In the literature and art section, in addition to two translated works, there is also Zheng Zhenduo's "The Development of Long Novels from the Early Qing Dynasty to the Mid-Qing Dynasty," which has been completed in this issue. In addition, there are columns such as "Social Scenes," "Science Series," and "New Dictionary of Words," as well as photographic pictorials, which also contain many novel materials.</p>

Jun Jing titled special issue of the Joint Premium Co., Ltd., realizing mutual benefit. Wang Zhengting, Marketing cooperation builds the foundation of the nation, Wu Xingdou titled the opening of the Joint Premium Company, a unique approach to cooperation between production and sales. Du Yuesheng's opening speech for the Joint Premium Company. Zhang Zhuping, The Joint Premium Company was initiated last September. After a year of preparation, it is officially opening today. While we are happy about its success, we deeply feel the weight of the mission it bears and its great relationship with all aspects of society. We cannot help but say a few words to the public. The method of joint premiums is not new. However, before today, we have not heard of anyone in the country adopting this method. Therefore, it is not impossible to say that this is our first attempt. We initiated this move not because we like novelty, but because we are aware of the current market depression and sluggish production and sales. Without this new method of promotion, it would be impossible to transform hoarding and ensure the smooth circulation of goods. If we want to ensure the smooth circulation of goods, we naturally rely on advertising, whether it is through newspapers, leaflets, or broadcasting. However, while this is enough to attract the attention of buyers, it is not enough to stimulate their interest. Recently, commercial competition has become increasingly fierce. As a result, some people have resorted to the power of premium coupons to stimulate the interest of buyers. Its effectiveness is naturally greater than the power of advertising. However, if this is done independently by manufacturers or retailers, a separate department must be established to handle it. The procedures are cumbersome and the expenses are huge. Moreover, the coupons issued by store A cannot be exchanged for goods in store B, and the coupons issued by store C cannot be exchanged for goods in store A. This is not universal. This is not enough to make it convenient for buyers. Moreover, the variety of goods prepared by one store is ultimately limited. Silk and satin stores are limited to silk and satin, sundries stores are limited to sundries, and stationery stores are limited to stationery. Apart from exchanging them for goods of the same kind, there is nothing else to seek. This is also not enough to make it convenient for buyers. Even if there are things to seek, what is suitable for housewives may not be suitable for the head of the family. What is suitable for the head of the family may not be suitable for his children. Therefore, the premium coupons of a single store may not be liked by the entire family of buyers. This is also not enough to make it convenient for buyers. However, our Joint Premium Company is different. Our Joint Premium Company prints various joint premium coupons on behalf of manufacturers or retailers who want to use premium coupons for procurement. Manufacturers and retailers use these coupons, attach them to the goods, and give them away with the goods. The purchaser can then hold the coupons or accumulate a certain amount and exchange them at the premium exchange points established by our company for the goods they need. The premium exchange points of our company are stocked with as many as six or seven hundred kinds of goods, ranging from the needs of the elderly to the needs of children. Everything is available. Moreover, a joint premium catalog is printed for buyers to choose from. Buyers do not have to go to stores A, B, or C in person, but can get the items from stores A, B, and C as they wish. How convenient is this for buyers? For manufacturers and retailers, they do not need to establish a separate department and spend money, but can fulfill their wish to give premiums. How convenient is this for merchants and factories? Moreover, the joint premium catalog printed by our company lists in detail what goods are available in which store and which factory. This is no different from doing our best to promote store A and factory A. In addition to the catalog, our company will also use newspapers to publish large-scale advertisements for promotion. Therefore, for stores and factories that use joint premium coupons, we will do our best to promote them. Therefore, today's Joint Premium Company is actually a service organization for production and sales, and can make all parties praise its convenience. The above words are not meant to be boastful. Future facts will prove that my words are not false.</p>
<h3>The Mission and Benefits of the Joint Premium Company</h3>
<p>Xu Yongzuo, The joint premium method comes from the evolution of advertising techniques. It has been popular in Europe and the United States for many years and has achieved remarkable results. However, in our country, it is still a groundbreaking move. Its mission is to connect production and sales, making it easier to supply consumers with high-quality products. The second is to adjust unfair competition in business and reverse the general trend of speculation. In terms of its benefits, on the one hand, it can reduce the premium procedures for manufacturers and sellers and achieve great promotional effects. On the other hand, it can allow buyers to obtain evenly distributed premiums in addition to high-quality goods, so that they will not have a sense of regret. It is indeed a good strategy to assist trade. In recent years, the social economy has been difficult and the market situation has been chaotic. Those who advertise with large price reductions and large premiums are everywhere, arousing people's opportunistic hearts and leading to a dead end. People with insight are all worried about it. The Joint Premium Company was born at this time, and the people who preside over it are advertising experts and industry giants who seek cooperation between production and sales and reverse the auspicious trend of commerce. Its ability to promote and benefit will surely be achieved. Special issue of the Joint Premium Co., Ltd. With service as its purpose. Pan Chen titled the special issue of the Joint Premium Co., Ltd. A perfect combination, a famous new industry. A field of merchandising where a service spirit can be instilled. Peng Chuang, The drug soars like a peng, and Bei Yi leads the people to gather goods.

<h3>A Word to the Industrial and Commercial Sectors and the Public</h3>
<p>Zheng Bin, In the past ten years or so, my country's industry and commerce have been increasing day by day. In Shanghai, factories are standing tall and business is booming. The speed of progress is rapid. However, in these times of global recession, all industries are declining. Industry is oversupplied, and commerce is declining. Therefore, they are each seeking their own way to revive. Various methods are emerging one after another, such as large price reductions, premiums, lotteries, and large-scale advertisements, competing with each other to help promote business. The methods are all good, but they are inevitably too cumbersome. The Joint Premium Company is rising up at this time, and it is a guide for various industrial and commercial sectors to promote business. In Europe and the United States, this kind of premium coupon has been in use for a long time and has achieved very good results. Now, the Joint Premium Company imitates it, which is of great benefit to manufacturers, retailers, and the public. For manufacturers and retailers, using joint premium coupons is enough to promote their goods and increase their business. Those who get these premium coupons can also exchange them for the premiums they need at any time, which is very convenient. Moreover, the premiums prepared by the Joint Premium Company are mostly products from famous factories across the country, and the collection is beautiful and complete. The power of publicity is great, and the effect of promotion is also great. Therefore, the products of manufacturers can be collected without any effort. Therefore, those who use joint premium coupons can directly help their business and indirectly promote domestic goods. There are a hundred benefits and no harm. I sincerely hope that all businesses, patriotic enthusiasts, and women will pay special attention to the joint premium coupons. Hopefully, domestic goods can be revitalized and the market can be transformed into prosperity.</p>
<h3>The Origin and Current Situation of Joint Premiums</h3>
<p>Lu Meizeng, Whether in ancient or modern times, and no matter where, inside or outside the country, we all have round heads and square toes. There is no one who does not covet convenience. The country uses this psychology to set up various methods such as low-priced premiums to attract customers and seek business development. Let's look at the old-fashioned stores in our country. They must hold low-price events when they open, or increase the quantity of goods, or reduce the value, to give customers preferential treatment, hoping that they will patronize them continuously. Recently, they have also used methods such as buy one get one free and adding three feet to the foot to attract customers. All they want is to make those who come satisfied and create a good impression so that transactions can continue permanently. Commercial wars are becoming more and more fierce, and competitive methods are emerging one after another. There is also the so-called premium method, that is, attaching small goods to the goods as a gift to win the customer's favor. Looking at the situation in Europe and the United States, it is also the same. For example, bakeries sell bread in dozens of thirteen, and adding one cent to get two items are all common methods of attracting customers. Over time, they have indeed had a considerable effect on maintaining and promoting business. The premium value in the United States reaches 300 million US dollars throughout the year. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia are also very popular. The most famous newspaper in the United Kingdom used premiums to increase sales, reaching 2 million daily sales. It can be seen that premiums can arouse customers' interest and promote merchants' business. The above only refers to individual premiums. However, there are still shortcomings. The things given may not all be what customers need, and the cost and procedures for merchants to print coupons and exchange goods are also inevitably laborious. Twenty years ago, the United States established the United Mutual Benefit Company, which specializes in serving the industrial and commercial sectors, with the business of printing coupons and exchanging premiums. The scale is grand and the effect is remarkable. Subsequently, the Spero Hackin Company emerged, issuing green premium coupons. Those who adopted it praised its convenience. Merchants can save on expenses and procedures, and customers can collect coupons very conveniently and exchange premiums very freely. Therefore, it was popular for a while and praised as the best method. Now that the domestic economy is declining and all industries are sluggish, it is not enough to solve the problem of merchants selling goods and arouse customers' interest in buying unless a new path is opened up. Therefore, we have adopted European and American methods, taken into account the social situation, and gathered like-minded people to establish the Joint Premium Co., Ltd. in Shanghai. The talent organization must be comparable to those in Europe and the United States, with the main purpose of serving the public and the prerequisite of seeking mutual benefit for production and sales. The future of my country's industry and commerce will be promising.</p>
<h3>The Ambition to Establish the Joint Premium Company</h3>
<p>Yu Huidong, The Joint Premium Company was born today. Looking back on the preparations over the past year, such as the gathering of initiators, the filing with the Social Bureau, the raising of shares, the holding of the founding meeting, the registration with the Ministry of Industry, and the various busy situations after starting operations, are still vivid in my mind. Thanks to the cooperation of all industries and the efforts of colleagues, we have been able to start building a foundation for social affairs today and lay the foundation for production and sales cooperation. The joy in my heart is truly beyond words. The Joint Premium Company has not yet succeeded today. Various hopes remain to be gradually realized. Therefore, I will describe the ambition to establish the company to clarify the purpose of organizing the Joint Premium Company and its goals for the future. It is found that the domestic economy is declining and the market is sluggish, and this is particularly severe. It is not easy to manufacture and sell goods, and there is a lack of sales experts to use. In order to compete and survive, general merchants use the method of giving premiums. However, doing it alone is costly and there is no good plan. There are many false arrows. Social figures do not know how to choose goods. They are dazzled by the premiums and do not know what to do. It is difficult for production and sales to cooperate. Therefore, there must be a great service organization to mediate between the two parties. It has considerable contact with manufacturers and makes practical contributions to consumers. Take the joint premiums jointly used by dozens of manufacturers and retailers as the vanguard and high-quality goods as the backing. Treat the symptoms and the root cause at the same time to correct the current ills and plan for future development. Therefore, the Joint Premium Company was created. Concentrate talents to provide loyal service to make production and sales cooperate. Based on experience, use new and innovative methods to promote market prosperity. Incorporate the method into the right track. Indirectly, we can also promote the virtue of savings. We deeply know that the responsibility is great and the work is not easy. However, we have always taken service as our duty and have vowed to do our best to pursue our original intention. I hope that all sectors will frequently give advice. If Hua Kuang is not achieved, then so be it.</p>
<h3>Joint Premiums Benefit the Public</h3>
<p>The joint premium method set by the Joint Premium Co., Ltd. has been popular in Europe and the United States for a while and has been quite effective. In our country, it is groundbreaking. I am fortunate to have been recommended by the shareholders as one of the supervisors. I ask myself that my talent is not up to the task. Because I firmly declined, I could not get it. I had no choice but to follow the gentlemen and strive to serve, hoping to reduce my mistakes. In my opinion, the company is the first production and sales service organization in our country. It benefits both merchants and customers, so I am happy to promote it. The word "premium" has long been used in the market, especially in Shanghai. However, the premium method used in the market is independent, which is different from the joint situation. If it is independent, the pattern is limited to one industry and is incomplete. If it is joint, it gathers hundreds of companies. The objects are different and the styles are different. For example, if you choose goods in one store, there may be places that do not suit your wishes. If you gather hundreds of kinds of goods in one hall and choose one or two, you will definitely be satisfied. And (exclusive premium) coupons. If the value is one dime or five cents, if the distance to the exchange point is far away, if you want to go to exchange, the car fare is greater than the coupon price, and it is not worth the loss, so you give up and do not use it. Then you get as if you do not get. Now, the joint organization gathers the premium coupons obtained from various places. You can ignore who gave them. You only need to calculate the number of coupons, and you can hold them to the exchange point to exchange them, saving a lot of time and money. For merchants, if they do it alone, the premium power is limited, and the printing fee is really considerable. If the paper is good, the cost is high. If the printing group rate is not only not beautiful, but also makes people disgusted, and it is easy to be counterfeited, which is a loss. Taking Shanghai as an example, every inch of land is worth its weight in gold. One house has its own use, and it cannot be designated to store this kind of premium coupons all year round. The method set by the company is simple and cost-effective. It has a great effect and is enough to maintain the existing business and promote future sales. It is a good thing. I hope that all merchants will consider the situation and adopt this method to try it. And build a building from the ground up to create a new face and choose to see other kinds of open iron nets and corals for picking. Affection should be better than a plum blossom. The strategy is updated and innovated. The key to managing the goods is to maintain the spirit. The five cities are happy to rise together and make people who divide the Cao to shoot the covering.

<h3>The Relationship Between Joint Premium Coupons and Promoting Goods</h3>
<p>By Yao Junwei</p>
<p>The current economic downturn in industry and commerce is truly undeniable. We have repeatedly sought the reasons for this downturn. Although it is said to be affected by the global economic recession and the weakness of people's purchasing power, the inadequacy of promotional methods and the lack of novelty in sales strategies are also contributing factors!</p>
<p>The obvious reality shows that many excellent commodities have failed because they did not use advertising promotion and improve sales methods. Recently, people have gradually realized its importance, and everyone is paying close attention to it, and even competing with each other. As a result, many stores, in order to stimulate the purchasing power of buyers and cater to the psychology of the general public, have adopted the method of offering premiums. For example, we know that many new types of cigarettes on the market are prevalent in offering premiums. Under the circumstances of public demand in this social trend, to expand the industry and commerce he operates, one must:</p>

<p>Special Edition of Joint Premium Coupon Co., Ltd., Commemorating Benefit to People and Merchants, Inscribed by Tang Baoshi.</p>
<p>Considering the psychology of joint patrons, it is not possible to stimulate the act of purchasing. The method of giving premiums can be said to be a wonderful method in sales strategy. However, the premiums stipulated by holding them independently cannot generally meet the needs of individuals, and at the same time, the time is short and the region is limited, so the power is also weak. On the store's side, in order to hold premium events, it must set up a separate department, specializing in duties such as printing premium coupons and setting methods. The procedures are very complicated, and the expenses are huge, so you have to consider it. Now, the Joint Premium Coupon Company has emerged in response. They implement agency services for both production and sales, based on the successful methods that have been popular in Europe and the United States for a long time. After detailed inspection of the publicity situation in the drawings, planning for many years, and perfect organization, it can be said that there is nothing imperfect. The premium coupons issued have united manufacturers and retailers across the country to use. There are also often huge, novel, and eye-catching advertisements to expand publicity, as well as exquisite premium catalogs and year-round display premium display windows, as a strong backing, so the effect is huge. Whether it is already selling or newly released products, they should all use joint premium coupons to assist in sales, and can grasp a very satisfactory success. Any product, using joint premium coupons to call, will definitely achieve great and long-term practical results, there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>We can confirm this from the functions exerted by the joint premium coupons themselves and the reasons why the public hopes to receive joint premium coupons. For example:</p>
<p>Joint premium coupons can be used arbitrarily anytime, anywhere;</p>
<p>Joint premium coupons, no matter where they come from, can be combined effectively;</p>
<p>Joint premium coupons are used by many merchants, and it is very easy to get coupons;</p>
<p>Joint premium coupons, with novel methods, can arouse the interest of accumulation;</p>
<p>Joint premium coupons, sold widely, have a permanent and great calling ability;</p>
<p>Joint premium coupons, with simple and reliable procedures. According to these points, it can be determined that in the future, if the masses buy goods, they will definitely choose goods with joint premium coupons, so that they can accumulate small amounts into large amounts. Replacing beloved and satisfactory premiums, goods with joint premium coupons will inevitably be deeply imprinted in people's minds, with a constant determination to use them. And the store that gives away this joint premium coupon, after giving the coupon with the goods, does not need to ask about everything, and the Joint Premium Coupon Company will implement the agency service. Under this mutually beneficial condition for both buyers and sellers, who would not be happy to do it? Then, the circulation of joint premium coupons is actually opening up a new way to promote goods for the entire commercial market. I hope that the industrial and commercial circles across the country understand that joint premium coupons have a deep relationship with themselves, and love this new business that is just sprouting as much as possible!</p>
<h3>How to Satisfy Buyers</h3>
<p>By Lu Shou Lun</p>
<p>How to fully satisfy buyers is a point that businessmen in modern times are anxious to consider. Therefore, on the one hand, they strive to improve their products, and on the other hand, they pay attention to the innovation of sales plans. If they only focus on improving production and neglect sales methods, it is like putting a bright pearl in a casket and abandoning it. They can only know their own satisfaction, but cannot let buyers know their satisfaction. Therefore, improving products and sales plans are like a boat and a rudder, which cannot be separated.</p>
<p>There are many sales methods, and if you don't get the right way, you will inevitably get twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, shrewd and capable sales personnel can get a large harvest by sowing only a few seeds, and this harvest is very permanent and can never be compared with those who are struggling for a while. Therefore, in every company, the sales department has the same important position as manufacturing. Premiums are the atomic weight for increasing purchasing power and the vital element for modern product promotion. Therefore, sales personnel also do their best to use premiums. Although they can arouse the interest of buyers, the types of premiums are limited and may not be able to win the satisfaction of every buyer. This is still a fly in the ointment and cannot help but be regrettable!</p>
<p>Since the joint premium method became popular in Europe and the United States, every product that joins has achieved considerable results, which is a hundred times better than giving away individually. Its advantages are:</p>
<p>(1) The quantity of premiums is abundant, and you can choose as much as possible. It is not like the limited restrictions of the regulations, forcing people to get what they don't want. The method is flexible, and more people welcome it.</p>
<p>(2) Since premiums can be selected, the coupons for exchanging premiums must be in the specified quantity. If you are eager to get a certain premium, and the number of coupons is not enough, you will inevitably have to purchase goods from merchants participating in the joint premium to make up the amount.</p>
<p>(3) Premium coupons are easy to obtain and easy to collect. Even if you give them to friends as gifts, they are not much different from gift certificates. Buyers are the source of business life, so businesses should put themselves in the shoes of buyers and carefully understand the psychology of buyers, and then the business of the businesses themselves can be promoted accordingly. Since joint premiums are welcomed by buyers, businesses that join joint premiums will surely benefit even more.</p>
<p>Joint premiums are only a first in China, and their goal is to serve. They don't care about anything else. They just want to find a new way to develop for China's commerce, which is on the verge of extinction.</p>

<p>Liang Songnian Spends Sixteen Years of Time</p>
<h3>Inventing Plant Gasoline Successfully</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Test Results Were Excellent, Factory Will Be Set Up in Shanghai for Manufacturing</p>
<p>Cantonese Liang Jun Songnian, studied overseas during the late Qing Dynasty, researched chemistry and art industry for many years, and invented seven-color art glass in the early Republic of China, which was popular in the world. Later, he felt that after the end of the European War, Germany failed due to lack of gasoline. The agreement with the United States to join the war group was made, and they tried their best to transport gasoline and won the victory. He deeply knew the importance of gasoline to transportation and military use, so he abandoned art and specialized in chemistry, thinking of artificial creation to seize the work of heaven, and to replace imported mineral gasoline, he carefully studied for sixteen years, after 918 tests, he finally succeeded in making gasoline from plants. He publicly tested in Beijing and Guangdong before, and the effect was unexpected, which was deeply praised by all circles. The news has been reported in the press. Yesterday, at the invitation of William, the British manager of Kais Foreign Company in Shanghai, and Mr. Gordon, together with Mr. Zhang Zhongping, Mr. Cai Guoping, and Mr. Zhou Fupei, the general manager of Huamei Gasoline Car Company, took a city-licensed No. 6183 Special Zone licensed No. 2024 car and used plant gasoline to drive out of the Bund in front of Guangdong Road Dalai Mail Ship Company, via North Sichuan Road, Jiangwan Road, Yinxiang Road, and reached the city center area, and then drove back along the original road. It was found that the oil was superior to mineral gasoline in ten points: (1) fast ignition, (2) strong burning power, the car travels steadily, without shaking or undulating, especially rapid and sharp advancement when going uphill, (3) no smoke, avoiding the disadvantage of blocking and exploding the cylinder, (4) no odor, and has a plant-based fresh fragrance, (5) the fire emits white light, (6) the manufacturing method is simple, (7) the cost is low, (8) the raw materials are all plants, which are available everywhere and at any time, and there is no danger of exhaustion, unlike minerals which are limited by nature, (9) the oil volume can be freely increased or decreased, so it can be applied to cars and airplanes, (10) in addition to extracting gasoline, the oil residue can be used to make paint oil, rubber and other by-products, and the residue can be used to feed livestock, making the best use of everything, with no waste at all. After the actual test, Mr. William shook hands with Mr. Liang tightly and said first, "I didn't expect you to come up with this, and have this miraculous effect of plant-made oil. Scholars from various countries have long known about this and have been researching it, but have never seen it work. Now that you have obtained it, you have truly broken the world record. The major problem of the world's wartime gasoline panic will also be solved from now on. I would like to congratulate you and congratulate the future of your country," etc. At noon, the staff of various lines in front of Dalai Company took a rest and came out one after another. Hearing about it, they gathered around to watch, and shook hands with Mr. Liang to express their greetings, and inquired about the future business methods. It is heard that they will purchase land in Shanghai to set up a factory and produce in large quantities to meet the requirements of the people of the country, and plan to invite people from all walks of life and newspaper reporters for public experiments in the near future, in order to promote it.</p>
<h3>Yongping Sinks American Ship</h3>

<h3>Love Sea Storms Move Murderous Intent</h3>
<p>Ding Shifen is infatuated again and again and is actually harmed by her lover</p>
<p>Lao Bingnan likes the new and hates the old and is poisoned by an evil plan</p>
<p>The Net of Heaven is Vast and the Murderer Cannot Escape the Law</p>
<p>At 7:30 a.m. on the 11th of this month, a murder case of a woman was discovered on the wasteland of the Wusong Fort Taiwan Radio Station. The deceased was Ding Shifen from Yangzhou, 32 years old, with a bit of beauty, dressed in a modern fashion, romantic in nature, fond of making male friends, and indiscriminately giving love. In the past, she lived in Zhabei. In May of the 15th year of the Republic of China, she went to the Great World to play and met Shi Wenlou, a fellow villager who worked as a driver in Lilli Automobile Company (38 years old). So she went to a hotel together, opened a room for a private meeting, and had</p>
<h3>Hated to Meet Late</h3>
<p>In the previous year, during the January 28th Shanghai War, Ding's residence was burned down by artillery fire, so she moved to the pavilion room on the third floor of the Cheng Yi Clothing Store at No. 1, Julaida Road, French Concession. At that time, Shi Wenlou had been appointed as the deputy manager of Nanjing Automobile Company at No. 157, Muer Ming Road. Whenever Ding went to the Nanjing Automobile Company to find her lover Shi Wenlou, she would meet Lao Bingnan, a Yangzhou man (25 years old) who worked as an accountant, and they ended up looking at each other. Lao also had a physical relationship with Ding. In addition to Nanjing Automobile Company, Lao also served as an accountant for Feili Automobile Company at No. 383, Xiaoshadu Road, and No. 29, Avenue Sainte Marie, etc.</p>
<h3>Progressing Quite Richly</h3>
<p>Therefore, she often went to Ding's place. From then on, colleagues and fellow villagers, a love triangle, the woman mediated between the two parties. Until the end of the previous year, because of the end of the lunar year, she sent eight yuan to Ding Zhoufen's place. She observed that the door was locked and there was a sound in the room. After the second landlord truthfully informed, the mistress Ding Shifen opened the door and welcomed her into the room. Lao and Shi met each other, broke up unhappily, and immediately broke away from Shi. However, Ding Shifen was unwilling, so she filed a lawsuit in court in January of last year, accusing Shi of abandonment and demanding alimony.</p>
<h3>Repeatedly Lost the Case</h3>
<p>Until November of last year, the Nanjing Supreme Court ruled that Ding Shifen's lawsuit against Shi Wenlou was upheld in the original judgment. Because of face, Ding moved to No. 10, Dachong Lane, Tongfu Road. She was addicted to smoking, so she also opened a den for smoking opium and hired Ding Youzhi's daughter Yang Dajinzi as an assistant. However, Lao Bingnan had always liked to visit prostitutes. Recently, he went to Zhijin Brothel on Shantou Road to hang out and fell in love with Huaye Laoqi again. He built another love nest near Dongxinqiao in the French Concession. Laoqi was jealous of Ding Shifen and often went to Ding's place to quarrel and fight fiercely. And Lao actually</p>
<h3>Abandoned the Old for the New</h3>
<p>In order to get it done once and for all, he had evil intentions and colluded with Dai Yujin, a rogue fellow villager, to find a way to secretly move Ding Shifen, and said that after reaching the goal, all the business equipment in Ding's den would be completely transferred to Dai for receipt as a reward. So on the 11th of this month, Dai secretly killed Ding Shifen. Therefore, the next day, he went to receive the opium den at No. 10, Dachong Lane, Tongfu Road, and continued to attract customers to trade as usual. There was Ding Shifen's cousin Wang Zhang, and the Yangzhou people She Chaoxiang, whose relatives opened the Yuzhengji barber shop on Weihaiwei Road, often went to Ding Shifen's place to have fun. Suddenly</p>
<h3>Ding Went Missing</h3>
<p>Dai received it silently, very carefully. Just as she was unable to visit, she saw the news published in this newspaper on August 11th, so she immediately drove to investigate and learned that the deceased was indeed Ding Shifen. She immediately reported the information to Yao Guangnai, the district chief of the Seventh District, and asked Lu Ying, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to order the chief and deputy class leaders of the district's Criminal Investigation Team, Xin Jingsheng and Wei Feng, to lead Gu Youzhi, Tao Jinsheng, and other detectives to investigate the murderer separately. It has been found out that the detectives went to No. 10, Dachong Lane, Tongfu Road in secret this morning with Chinese and Western detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession, and arrested the murderer Dai Yujin from Yangzhou, and Lao Bingnan, the principal offender, who was an accountant in three companies including New York Automobile Company, and handed them over to the police station for detention. The Public Security Bureau prepared a document and went to the court to extradite them for legal action. At the end of the case, the four boatmen who fell into the water were rescued by the water police team's small steamer after the accident, and only three of them were rescued. One person's whereabouts were unknown, and the body was not recovered. Yongping set sail as usual. The boatmen on the civilian rice ship that was victimized have reported to the Navigation Administration and demanded compensation. The wild mandarin ducks' good dreams are in full swing</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (14th), it was learned that on Monday (13th) morning, a Japanese man carried six hand grenades and intended to blow himself up at the entrance of Hongkou Park. Fortunately, he was arrested by a detective from the Dixwell Road police station; otherwise, a great disaster would have occurred, and many would have been killed or injured, and valuable property would have been damaged. The Japanese man's name is Goto, a former volunteer in the Japanese army. He and a Japanese woman are currently being detained by the police of the Japanese consulate for thorough investigation. It is said that the concession police also found a hand grenade at the Japanese man's residence at No. 4, Dong Jiaxing Road. On Sunday night, an officer from the Dixwell Road police station noticed that the Japanese man's actions were strange and paid attention to him.

The Japanese man confessed at the police station that he intended to blow himself into powder. The reason for wanting to commit suicide was due to economic hardship. When the detectives went to arrest him, he was about to commit suicide, but his hands were held and he could not move, so he was spared from causing disaster.

<h3>Suicide of a Student at the Sino-French School</h3>
<p>Wang Xun Borrows a Room at the Oriental Hotel and Takes Poison, Found and Dies Despite Medical Treatment</p>
<p>\- Beside Him, Besides a Suicide Note, There Was Also a Photo of Wan Lingyu -</p>
<p>Wang Qingpu, an Anhui native residing at No. 27, Tongkang Lane, Huacheng Road, is 46 years old and a flour merchant. He has a son, named Xun, who is nearly twenty years old and studying at the Sino-French School in Baxianqiao. Unexpectedly, the results of the current exam were not very good, and the school announced that he would not be able to advance to the next grade. When Wang Xun learned of this, he felt that he was getting older and his studies were difficult to improve, so he was resentful and had the idea of ​​giving up on life. At about 8 a.m. the day before yesterday, he lied to his father that he was going to the school to study, hoping to be able to advance to the next grade, and asked for three yuan in tuition. His father agreed to his request. After obtaining the money, he went to the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road, using the alias Ding Hongxing, and booked room 258. Behind people's backs, he secretly swallowed opium smoke to commit suicide. Until about 1 a.m. yesterday morning, the hotel's tea servant suddenly heard groaning sounds from his room, one after another. Suspecting something was wrong, he tried to open the door and discovered that he was lying on the bed, pale. He rushed to notify the front desk, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he died soon after. The hospital reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered detective Cao Qishan to go to investigate. They found a suicide note beside him, addressed to the hotel manager, which roughly stated that he was very sorry for committing suicide here, and that he left a wallet, a gold watch, foreign coins, and two photos of Wan Lingyu, which he entrusted to be given to his family. The note also indicated his home address. The detective then notified the deceased's father according to the address and took his body to the Philander Road morgue. Yesterday morning, he reported to the First Special District Court, which appointed prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, to go to the morgue to examine the body. After examining the body and questioning the deceased's father, Wang Qingpu, Mr. Guo announced that the deceased Wang Xun, male, had died of opium poisoning before his death.

<p>Took a room at the New World Hotel at the intersection of Tibet Road and Nanjing Road, sleeping together and having a relationship. From then on, they continued to enjoy themselves, lingering and forgetting to return, for a whole month. At that time, Guo used all kinds of tricks to coax her, saying that his wife was still vacant and that he was willing to marry Pan. At that time, the love between the two had reached the boiling point, so they made vows of love and agreed to a lifelong commitment. Every moonlit night, double shadows could be seen, coming and going together, as if they were husband and wife. After several springs, Miss Pan secretly became pregnant, so she rented a house at No. 12, Xinping Lane, to live in. At this time, Guo suddenly changed his attitude and became increasingly indifferent to Miss Pan. At first, he would come and go from time to time, but then he suddenly disappeared and never came again, causing Pan to be heavily pregnant, and it has been eight months now. She is about to give birth, and life is difficult. She had no choice but to notify Guo Wenyu, ordering him to come and find a way to solve the problem, but Guo not only did not go, but also invited many hooligans to break into Pan's house and carry out intimidation, saying that in the future, she should not pester Guo, that they should cut off all ties and have nothing to do with each other. If she argued a little, she would be slapped in the face. After Miss Pan was seduced and raped by Guo, she had no face to go home and could not see her elders in Jiangdong. Moreover, she is about to give birth, and her life is precarious. The defendant's behavior violates Article 244 of the Criminal Law by using fraud to make women mistakenly believe that there is a marital relationship and obey their rape, and also attached to the case of civil litigation, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate for future living expenses of 400 yuan per year, limited to 15 years, totaling 6,000 yuan. The court accepted the complaint and ordered a summons. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Nai Xiefen presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant did not arrive. The lawyer arrived in court and said that the defendant's name was not Guo Wenyu, but Guo Wenyu, and that he was not an employee of the Yikang Qianzhuang, but an employee of the Minli Hospital at No. 702, Hankou Road. Therefore, the defendant did not receive a summons today, but saw the news in the newspaper and sent his lawyer to the case, requesting a postponement. However, it was found that the plaintiff Pan Fengbao was a prostitute who served Ye at the Liangyue Bookstore on Shantou Road last August and Mid-Autumn Festival, with the stage name A Qi. Later, she was transferred to the Fuyu Lane Huaxiaohong Bookstore. This year, in January, she was transferred to the Huiewen Bookstore in the same lane. The defendant was introduced by his friend Yuan Jingbang and met the plaintiff at Liangyue on Shantou Road, spending more than 1,000 yuan on drinks and entertainment, but there was no relationship whatsoever. Afterwards, Judge Xiao declared that the case was related to public morality and prohibited the audience. He then asked the plaintiff Pan Fengshi about the process. Later, because the defendant did not arrive, he ordered that the case be postponed for seven days.</p>
<h3>Unauthorized Reproduction of "A Story of Laughter and Tears"</h3>
<p>San You Bookstore Sues Lin Zihou, the Court Orders Lin to Post Bail and Postpones the Trial</p>
<p>Zhang Henshui's novel "A Story of Laughter and Tears" has been well-received by novel lovers since its publication, so the book sells very well. The San You Bookstore on Hankou Road in this city is the distributor of the book, and bookstores in other cities purchase it from them for resale. However, Lin Zihou, the manager of the Hanwenyuan Bookstore at No. 438, Fuzhou Road, saw that San You made a lot of profit by selling the book, so he disregarded the law and reprinted "A Story of Laughter and Tears" and forged the seal of San You Bookstore on the last page of each book, making people mistakenly believe that it was still distributed by San You. He also sold it at a reduced price, and the Jiaotong Bookstore in Suzhou purchased it from him. Recently, the manager of San You, Li Zengyao, found out about this and first filed a criminal complaint against Wang Wenji, the manager of the Jiaotong Bookstore, with the Wuxian Local Court, requesting that he be punished according to the law. The investigation has now concluded, and Wang Wenji has been sentenced to a fine. Now San You has hired lawyers Wu Zhiping, Wang Weizhen, and Yan Yinwu to file a complaint with the First Special District Court against the Hanwenyuan Bookstore and its manager Lin Zihou, arguing that the defendant's behavior violates Articles 234 and 269 of the Criminal Law and other crimes, requesting that he be arrested and punished according to the previous case, and that because the defendant's unauthorized reproduction and forgery caused the plaintiff a great loss, he also filed a civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate for the amount of loss that has been verified, totaling 811 yuan and 80 cents. After the First Special Court accepted the case, it opened a trial several times, but because the defendant Lin Zihou refused to appear in court, the trial has not been conducted. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng Baosun summoned the defendant again, and the defendant finally surrendered. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intention of the lawsuit, he presented the original version of the novel "A Story of Laughter and Tears" and the defendant's forged and reprinted books. After Judge Deng examined them and questioned both the plaintiff and the defendant, he ordered Lin Zihou to post 300 yuan bail and postponed the trial. Concession</p>

The situation of the blooming of the strange flowers in both places is recorded as follows: The lotus flowers growing in pairs on one stem in the Gu Garden are a good variety left over from 600 years ago, since the end of the Yuan Dynasty. The shape of the flowers is extremely strange, with several heads clustered on one stem (as shown in the picture), with at least two heads growing in pairs on one stem and as many as thirteen heads growing in pairs on one stem. Each head contains stamens, and the petals have different colors, with white on the outside, red in the middle, and purple in the center, clearly demarcated, creating a strange dress. The most amazing thing is that similar strange flowers have also been found in the lotus pond of the Qingyang Port Railway Huayuan Hotel. However, with the arrival of the autumn wind, it is feared that they will soon wither. Ladies in Beijing and Shanghai who appreciate lotus flowers are now traveling on the Beijing-Shanghai Road, all eager to be the first to see them. Yong'an Silver Company</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Unlicensed Brokers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, requesting a strict ban on unlicensed brokers. The original text reads: "Petition for a factual request. On the 14th of this month, a letter from the Shanghai Coal and Charcoal Industry Association stated that the members' representatives at the current general meeting of the association proposed to ban unlicensed brokers from operating privately. The letter stated that there have always been many unlicensed private operators in the coal and charcoal industry in this city. Since our industry organized an association, we have always assisted the government in cracking down on them, and have seen some results. The tax revenue has increased year by year, which is not a small amount. Whether it is a short-term or long-term broker's license, our association will verify it and issue a certificate before applying to the government on behalf of the applicant. The handling has always been free of malfeasance. However, over time, there have been many cases of impersonation and fraudulent activities. Moreover, itinerant brokers and brokers' assistants have used all kinds of tricks. They have no fixed shops and operate privately everywhere, making it impossible to investigate. This not only damages the national tax revenue, but also greatly affects the business of the industry. We should report the difficult situation to the government and strictly crack down on it in order to enrich the national tax revenue and maintain business," etc. The proposal was approved at the general meeting. It was found that the resolution of the Second National Finance Conference this year on the reorganization of the local tax system included the following points regarding the broker's tax: "Brokers must obtain a license to operate. Whether it is a short-term or long-term license, they should have a fixed shop in the county, city, town, or market trading place. Itinerant brokers and brokers' assistants should be gradually abolished. When establishing a broker's shop, they must provide a guarantee. If they operate in accordance with the law after the establishment, the government should also provide protection." It is imperative to abolish itinerant brokers and crack down on unlicensed operations. The resolution of our association's current general meeting is in line with this purpose. In addition to waiting for the competent authorities to consider the local situation and make an overall solution, in the current transition period, we propose that the provincial government order the Shanghai and Baoshan County governments and the Shanghai Broker's Tax Collection Office to clarify the regulations. All short-term and long-term broker's licenses for newly established or already established coal and charcoal shops must be applied for by our association on their behalf, otherwise they will not be issued, which will make it easier to investigate. At the same time, the provincial government should order the Shanghai and Baoshan County governments to issue a notice to investigate and punish unlicensed private brokers in accordance with the regulations, and order them to apply to our association for a license on their behalf in order to increase tax revenue. Our association should also investigate and report to the government at any time for legal processing in order to achieve the effect of official and commercial cooperation and to lay the foundation for the reorganization of broker operations. We are hereby sending this letter to your association, asking for your review and approval to forward it to the relevant authorities for implementation," etc. Having received the letter, we found that the resolution of the National Finance Conference on the reorganization of the broker's tax, which was implemented by the Ministry of Finance this year, does have a resolution to gradually abolish itinerant brokers and brokers' assistants. The proposal of the members' representatives at the general meeting of the Coal and Charcoal Industry Association to ban unlicensed brokers from operating privately is in line with this purpose. However, it is difficult to crack down on unlicensed private brokers and brokers' assistants because their whereabouts are uncertain. It is better to have the industry itself report them, which is more practical. The association proposes that in the future, all short-term and long-term broker's licenses for newly established and already established coal and charcoal shops should be verified and applied for by the association on their behalf, which is not without merit. We are hereby forwarding this factual report, asking for your review and approval to forward it to the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office to crack down on unlicensed operators in accordance with the case, and at the same time order the Shanghai and Baoshan County governments to issue a ban on unlicensed private brokers and brokers' assistants in order to reorganize tax revenue and benefit business. This is a public mission." Public Works Department Increases Police Tax</p>
<h3>Appeals to Various Institutions by the Hotel Industry to Rectify</h3>
<p>Disregarding Taxpayer Rights by Actually Changing Tax Rates　　Exhausting Resources; Valuations Exceeding Rent by 50-60%　　The hotel industry hosted various sectors last night to report the actual situation.</p>
<p>New Voice Agency reports: Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's increase in patrol fees for the hotel industry, the Hotel Association hosted various sectors yesterday to report on the process and scheduled to petition the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council and Mayor Wu. Details are as follows:　　Hosting Various Sectors Yesterday at 6:00 PM, the Hotel Association specially hosted various sectors at the New World Hotel. Attendees included Zhang Yichen, Li Ruzhang, Cao Zhigong, Yuan Hongjun, and others, along with representatives from the press and the hotel industry, totaling over a hundred people. During the event, the association's chairman, Sun Qiuping, reported on the process and the petition situation. It was decided to go to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Director-General Zhong Si, Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government, Chairman Yu of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Citizens' Association to petition within days. The gathering dispersed at 10:00 PM.　　Letter to the Ratepayers’ Meeting At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the association specially sent Zou Juncen to the Ratepayers’ Meeting to petition. Secretary Tao Leqin received him and stated that efforts would be made to negotiate on each point. The original letter stated: Greetings, This association, in opposing the Shanghai Municipal Council's illegal increase in patrol fees for the hotel industry, has briefly described the facts and requested your association to forward a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for reasonable rectification and revocation of the order. The previous letter was not comprehensive, so we are submitting additional reasons and requesting your review and correction. The Municipal Council's increase in patrol fees will place the hotel industry in dire straits. According to investigations, the increase in fees for the Oriental Hotel, among others (details elsewhere), reaches as high as 50-60%. Therefore, the actual 14% tax rate has become approximately 21%. In terms of reason and principle, rent is agreed upon by the landlord and tenant, with a lease agreement and rent receipts as proof, which can be verified at any time. Now, the Municipal Council wants to compensate for tax revenue, exhausting resources by re-estimating the total rent based on room prices, resulting in an amount 50-60% higher than the original. Why overturn the iron rule of collecting patrol fees based on actual rent? This is the first point. It has been the Municipal Council's practice not to tax vacant rooms, but the authorized tax collectors refuse to implement this. Now that the hotel business is declining, the Municipal Council estimates rent based on room fees as the calculation unit. Is the tax collected directly from the guests? Are they not obligated to pay tax on rooms that are not rented out daily? This is the second point. This time, the Municipal Council, without authorization from the taxpayers, has unilaterally increased the rent tax rate, which has not increased nominally but has actually increased, violating the intentions of the highest authority. This is the third point. Currently, due to the scarcity of guests, hotels have to reduce prices or offer gifts to attract customers. Some offer 20% discounts on listed room prices, while others offer 36% or 40% discounts. Will the patrol fees be discounted accordingly? This is the fourth point. Merchants invest to make a profit. Room prices should exceed the actual rent; otherwise, how can expenses, taxes, interest, and losses be compensated? Has the Municipal Council ever exempted or subsidized hotels that have gone bankrupt? This is the fifth point. In summary, the Municipal Council's fee increase is not justified by law or fact. This association believes that this is not just a matter of increasing fees for the hotel industry but a complete change in the public concession's room fees, starting with the hotel industry. This association will lead the industry to insist on upholding the taxpayer's greatest right not to be undermined or disregarded, to prevent the Municipal Council from arbitrarily increasing fees. We are submitting additional reasons and requesting your review and prompt correction of the Municipal Council's scorched-earth policy.　　Investigation of Increased Fees The original patrol fee was 14% of the rent. Now, the Municipal Council has increased the rent amount for each hotel by 60% to 20%, based on the combined room rates. The following is a survey of those who have received notices: The Oriental Hotel's original annual rent was 50,400 yuan, now increased by 24,000, an increase of 47%, with a tax rate of 21%. The Wu Palace was originally 16,782 yuan, increased by 3,378 yuan, an increase of 20.1%, with a tax rate of 16%. The New World was originally 19,200 yuan, increased by 7,800 yuan, an increase of 40.2%, with a tax rate of 20%. The Huizhong was originally 36,503 yuan, increased by 20,198 yuan, an increase of 61.9%, with a tax rate of 21.6% (the above four households do not include the rental portion). The Greater China was originally 31,888 yuan, increased by 16,112 yuan, an increase of 50.5%, with a tax rate of 21%. The Jue Lu was originally 16,782 yuan, increased by 5,598 yuan, an increase of 33.3%, with a tax rate of 9%. The Zhongnan was originally 19,200 yuan, increased by 2,400 yuan, an increase of 12.5%, with a tax rate of 15%. The Great Shanghai was originally 33,566 yuan, increased by 8,914 yuan, an increase of 27.2%, with a tax rate of 17.5%.　　Hotel Industry Declaration The Shanghai Hotel Association declares its opposition to the illegal fee increase by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Bureau. It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Bureau recently intends to change the method of collecting patrol fees from the hotel industry, using the operating price of each hotel room as the standard, estimating the total rent of the building, and re-determining the fee amount. For example, the annual rent of the Oriental Hotel was 50,400 yuan, now estimated at 74,400 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. The Huizhong Hotel was originally 36,502 yuan, now estimated at 56,700 yuan, an increase of 20,198 yuan. The rate of increase has reached as high as 50-60%, so the actual tax rate of 14% has changed to about 21%. In this time of economic hardship, the entire Shanghai hotel industry sells less than 50% of its rooms daily. Members of the industry are facing closure due to losses, and there are frequent cases of owing employee guarantee money. The facts are all there and can be verified. The patrol fees levied on the hotel industry are different from those levied on other shops that rent buildings, which are completely self-used and not vacant. The hotel industry is more prone to losses due to the scarcity of customers, resulting in vacant rooms. (Listing five points, the same as the letter to the Taxpaying Chinese Association, omitted). In summary, the Municipal Council's fee increase is not justified by law or fact. This association believes that this is not just a matter of increasing fees for the hotel industry, but a complete change in the public concession's room fees, starting with the hotel industry. This association vows to lead the industry to insist on upholding the taxpayer's greatest right not to be undermined or disregarded, to prevent the Tax Bureau from arbitrarily increasing fees without regard to the difficulties of the citizens. This matter concerns changing the fixed rules for fee collection and suddenly increasing the burden on citizens. We hope that all sectors will uphold justice and provide assistance, so that the authorities can understand the situation as soon as possible, which will not only be fortunate for the hotel industry but also for the entire citizenry. This declaration is respectfully submitted for your consideration. August 15, 23rd year of the Republic of China, Yisheng Firm employees, Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Regarding the Assault on the Jianghua Shipowner</h3>
<p>The Jianghua ship of the China Merchants Bureau, on the 13th of this month, loaded a large batch of wheat from Yisheng Firm in Zhenjiang to be transported to Shanghai. According to regulations, grain loaded onto ships can only be placed in the hold to stabilize the ship, not on the second-floor deck. When Yisheng loaded the wheat, they strongly wanted to load it on the second-floor deck. Chen Jinyu, the shipowner of Jianghua, saw this and stepped forward to stop them, saying that loading grain on the deck would make the ship top-heavy, and in case of wind and waves at the mouth of the Yangtze River, the ship would be in great danger and it was absolutely not allowed to pile it on the deck. Unexpectedly, the Yisheng escort personnel disregarded Captain Chen's instructions and still ordered workers to pile the wheat on the deck. Chen saw that the obstruction was ineffective, so he came out to prevent the loading, not allowing their wheat to be piled on the deck again. Unexpectedly, the Yisheng escort personnel suddenly ordered the workers to beat Captain Chen. The order on the ship was in chaos. Chen Jinyu was beaten and injured by the workers of the passenger ship. The shipowner's uniform he was wearing was also completely torn. Fortunately, the crew came to rescue him, and Chen was rescued, but he had already been beaten and injured. Yesterday, the ship returned to Shanghai, and Chen Jinyu reported to the bureau. The bureau was very angry about this. The shipowner is the master of the ship and bears the heavy responsibility for the lives and property of all. The personnel on the ship should be under his command. Now, the employees of Yisheng Firm forcibly loaded wheat on the deck, and when advised against it, they even resorted to violence. Such a situation is absolutely lawless. In addition to keeping the torn uniform on file, the Zhenjiang branch was first ordered to earnestly negotiate with Yisheng to achieve punishment of the perpetrators, an apology, and an apology to the shipowner. Otherwise, legal action will be taken. Yesterday, the instruction to the Zhenjiang branch was issued, ordering them to handle it as soon as possible. Aviation Highway Lottery</p>
<h3>Spreading Leaflets by Airplane</h3>
<p>The National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has been issued since May of last year and has already held six draws.

It is believed that this lottery increases revenue for the country, and the cost to ticket buyers is limited, with the opportunity to win huge prizes. Therefore, Chinese and foreigners are very enthusiastic about buying tickets.</p>

<h3>News from the Civilian Obstetrics Hospital</h3>
<p>Expanding the Sanitarium, Providing Free Diagnosis and Delivery. The founders of the Hongkou Civilian Obstetrics Hospital, Huang Shaoxiong, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Gu Shaoqing, Chu Qiaqing, Wang Boqi, Wang Boyuan, Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, and Liu Hongsheng, etc., considering that the Hongkou area has many factories and poor female workers who are pregnant and giving birth cannot afford medical expenses, the hospital's wards, except for the first, second, and third classes that require a small fee, the regular wards provide free delivery, hospitalization, and medical expenses for those introduced by factories, groups, and organizations. Moreover, the hospital also provides internal and external departments, and all diseases are effectively treated. For poor workers, fees are also charged as appropriate. The daily registration is crowded, and everyone calls it good news. This year, there has been a severe drought and rampant epidemics. Thousands upon thousands of laborers in various factories have suffered from this disease. In view of this, the hospital established the Hongkou Civilian Epidemic Hospital in June at the intersection of Tongzhou Road. All medical expenses are waived, so those who request diagnosis and treatment arrive one after another, and the threshold is about to be worn through. The hospital director, Wang Boyuan, is capable and knowledgeable in medicine. Seeing that the hospital's buildings are insufficient, it is necessary to expand. Therefore, a large five-story foreign building at the intersection of Huade Road in Tilanqiao was rented and opened as a sanitarium, providing extensive diagnosis. Recently, several doctors who have studied in Germany and the United States have been hired to be responsible for treatment. The arrangements have already begun, and it will be opened to the public soon. In the future, those in the Eastern Shanghai area who suffer from diseases and do not have money for medical treatment will not be panicked.

<h3>Professor Ren Dao's Surprising Answers</h3>
<p>Professor Ren Dao, Prol. Zandar, is a remarkable person of our time. He answers every question and resolves doubts like a divine calculation.

Ren has now hired 40 assistants to work day and night. In the future, progress will be even faster.

Eight Boatmen from the Sunken Jin Wanshun Ship</p>
<h3>Rescued by the Zhongwei Taiping Steamer</h3>
<p>Can Be Sent to Shanghai Within Five Days　　Yesterday's notice from Xie Changlong stated that many civilian ships were wrecked outside Wusong Estuary in the recent hurricane. In addition to the accidents of the same Changyuan and other ships, which have been reported in this newspaper, the Zhongwei Shipping Company received a telegram from the owner of the Taiping steamer, stating that the Taiping, sailing from Shanghai to Haizhou, saw several boatmen drifting on the sea near Niu Pi Reef outside Wusong at 6:00 PM on the 10th, asking for help. The owner of the Taiping ordered the ship to stop and sent a sampan to rescue the people at sea. At that time, eight shipwrecked boatmen were rescued from the broken planks on the sea. All of them were from Ningbo. After boarding the ship, they were asked about the cause. They said that the Jin Wanshun civilian ship was registered in Zhejiang and had license number 809. It was transporting goods to Shanghai this time. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, it encountered a hurricane outside Wusong Estuary. The hull of the ship was destroyed by the big waves. All eight people on board, from the captain Jin Linsen to the others, fell into the sea. Everyone grabbed onto broken wooden planks and drifted at sea for three days and three nights. Everyone was immersed in the sea and turned pale. They had not eaten for three days and thought they would die. Now they were rescued. All eight people on board were saved. The owner of the Taiping provided food and clothing and treated them. However, because the ship was going to Haizhou, it would not be able to come to Shanghai until Sunday or Monday or Tuesday of next week. Therefore, a telegram was sent to Shanghai first, asking Zhongwei to inform Jiang Danhu, the owner of Xie Changlong at Xiaodongmen Street in this city. Yesterday, Chen Shuntong, the general manager of Zhongwei, delivered the message to Xie Changlong, and Mr. Jiang has come to Zhongwei to negotiate and expressed his gratitude to Mr. Chen for rescuing the eight crew members of Jin Changshun. Now Mr. Chen has agreed to inform him when the Taiping steamer returns to Shanghai with the eight people.</p>

<p>Reader's Questions and Answers</p>
<h3>On the Content of Works</h3>
<p>-Answer to Mr. Li Qiushi-</p>
<p>Mr. Li Qiushi wrote: (I have read some literary theory books and know that the quality of a work mainly depends on its content. A work without content, no matter how detailed the description, is like a bas-relief and cannot become a masterpiece. Recently, I saw Mr. Su Wen's short article (Without Content) in the Modern July issue of Literary Monologues, which made me confused again. Mr. Su opposes critics using the phrase (without content) to criticize other people's works. He believes that (content includes theme and material). A work (without a theme or a character background, leading to the progression of the story, we can say that it (has no) content), but such a work seems to have not yet appeared in China; even if there is one, it is almost equivalent to none. Is this correct? If according to Mr. Su, the so-called content in a work completely ceases to be a problem. I am suspicious and dare to ask the gentlemen to give me a clear explanation.)</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Li's letter, we believe that the first thing to explain to Mr. Li is the term (content), that is, whether content only includes theme and material, or if it also includes something else. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Yesterday's Chinese Tennis Club</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua vs. Ota - Match Undecided</h3>
<p>Ten to Eight, Five to Seven, Ended in a Draw Due to Darkness</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Defeats Kodera Seven to Five, Six to Two</p>
<p>Qiu Liang Defeats Yoshida and Kodera Six to Three, Six to Two</p>
<p>The group of Manchurian and Japanese player Ota, invited by the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, made their last appearance in Shanghai yesterday at the Chinese Tennis Club on Singapore Road. Except for Ota vs. Lin Baohua's singles match, where each won one set and the match was called off due to darkness, the rest were completely defeated. Qiu Feihai and Liang Deguang's doubles match was a light affair, winning against Kodera and Yoshida with six to three, six to two. Zheng Zhaojia showed great spirit, defeating Kodera with seven to five, six to two. The audience was still very enthusiastic yesterday, with about five or six hundred people. In total, during the Ota tennis team's stay in Shanghai, except for Ota's victory over Lin Baohua at the French Chamber of Commerce, they were all defeated. The players' skills were extremely ordinary.</p>
<p>▲Qiu Liang Defeats Kodera and Yoshida</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Steady and Composed</h3>
<p>The first match was Qiu Feihai and Liang Deguang against Ota and Kodera in doubles, but Ota, to conserve energy for the match against Lin Baohua, changed and had Yoshida partner with Kodera. Their skills were ordinary. Qiu Feihai was steady and composed, never missing a shot. Liang Deguang followed up and down, creating a wonderful scene. The performance was quite satisfactory. After the start, Qiu and Liang took two games in a row, making it three to one, and then three to two. Qiu's high-pressure shot and a light ball in front of the net earned a lot of applause, but after the ninth deuce, they still lost and it became three to three. After that, Qiu and Liang had smooth sailing, winning six to three.</p>
<h3>Japanese Players at a Loss</h3>
<p>From the second set, the Japanese players became increasingly unable to hold on. Liang Deguang obtained the service advantage. Kodera won a sudden service point, and each added one game, making it two to two. After that, Qiu and Liang blocked in front of the net, finding success on both sides, making Kodera and Yoshida scramble desperately, unable to parry. Furthermore, they frequently sent the ball into the net, and Qiu and Liang won again with six to two, quite easily.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Defeats Kodera</h3>
<h3>Zhaojia's Timidity Almost Causes Problems</h3>
<p>After the doubles match, Zheng Zhaojia and Kodera continued with a singles match. Zheng had a particularly beautiful performance, earning the audience's praise, but at the beginning, he still suffered from timidity, repeatedly sending the ball into the net or out of bounds, losing two games in a row. Zheng made an effort to rally, played carefully, and gradually gained confidence in his shots. After two to two, he regained Kodera's service game with a sliding shot, taking the lead with three to two. However, Zheng lost the sixth game due to repeated double faults in his service, making it three to three. Kodera added two more games, putting Zheng at five to three. Little Zheng was in imminent danger.</p>
<h3>Shows His Edge, Winning Four Games in a Row</h3>
<p>But at this moment, Zheng suddenly rallied, full of ambition and high spirits. After regaining Kodera's service game, he used fierce diagonal shots to make it five to five. Both sides carefully competed for the first point after that, but Kodera's one double fault and one net touch allowed Zheng to lead with six to five. He then increased his strength, resuming his cannonball-style serve, sharp diagonal shots, and taking advantage of the opportunity to go to the net, succeeding with ease, finally winning seven to five.</p>
<h3>Kodera Like the End of a Spent Arrow</h3>
<p>Zheng had reached his prime, leaving Kodera without anything to use. In the second set, he was even more sharp, Kodera ran around frantically, struggling to cope, and lost three games in a row in an instant. In the fourth game, Zheng had an even more beautiful shot, but he lost the game. In the following two games, Zheng won both. One game was a sliding shot, but Kodera also returned the favor with a sliding shot in one game. The result was six to two, and Zheng won again.</p>
<p>▲Lin Baohua and Ota Draw</p>
<h3>Evaluation of the Two Players' Skills</h3>
<p>After Lin Baohua lost to Ota seven to nine, four to six in the first match, Qiu Feihai defeated Ota with six to four, six to two. Lin, to avenge himself, specially arranged to fight Ota again yesterday. As a result, Lin won the first set with ten to eight, and Ota won the second set with seven to five. Because it was dark, the final victory could not be determined. Judging from Ota's skills, everything lies in familiarity, and there is nothing special about him. Lin Baohua, on the other hand, is too fiery, with repeated mistakes. Although his shots are powerful, they are not as steady as Ota. Even when it is impossible to take a risky kill shot, he repeatedly takes the risk to shoot with force, resulting in wasted effort and no benefit. That is why it is not easy for Lin to beat Ota.</p>
<h3>Ota's Ambition to Restore Reputation</h3>
<p>Seeing that all the team members had been completely defeated, Ota had no choice but to strive to rally, hoping to restore his reputation if possible. And Lin Baohua, in order to avenge his previous hatred, also increased his efforts to resist. Therefore, the battle was more intense than before. In the end, Lin's suicides were too many, turning a winnable set into a stalemate, ten to eight, with extraordinary effort. At the beginning, Lin often went to the net, with both successes and failures. After three to three, the two went through a long and intense battle, and Lin won two games in a row, leading with five to three. Unexpectedly, Lin was too eager to win and became impatient, losing three games instead, taking a disadvantage. Lin tried going to the net again and succeeded, so he was again in the lead with seven to six. Ota also did not show weakness, shot hard, and won two games in a row with sliding shots. Lin also won a service game with a sliding shot, eight to eight, then nine to eight. Lin had another chance, and Ota finally touched the net once and was trapped by Lin's powerful serve once. The result was Lin's victory with ten to eight.</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua's Risky Mistake</h3>
<p>In the second set, Lin still had a very winnable opportunity, but unfortunately he took risks and only committed suicide. Both sides had many balls that were won due to touching the net and bouncing over. In the first four games, each won a service game. After three to two, Ota broke Lin's service game and took the advantage. After Lin created four to four with a sliding shot, he again committed the fault of impatience, frequently sending the ball out of bounds, four to five, and five to five. Lin finally lost with five to seven. At that time, it was already dark and the final could not be made, so it ended in a draw.</p>

<h3>Promoting the National Sports Plan</h3>
<p>▲Organizing Sports Associations in Various Provinces</p>
<p>▲Preparing to Participate in the World Games</p>
<p>The China National Amateur Athletic Federation held a board meeting in the capital at the beginning of this month. At that time, nine resolutions were passed, which have been recorded in this newspaper. According to Zhou Jiaqi, a staff member of the association, the purpose of the association's planning committee, with Shen Siliang as the chairman, is to develop the national sports cause and promote the association's work universally. The Athletic Federation is the highest sports organization in the country, and the popularization of its work cannot be delayed. Currently, Mr. Shen is drafting various plans and will convene a meeting soon to discuss the implementation. One item is to organize sports associations in various provinces, guide local sports organizations, handle various sports matters, and resolve sports disputes. The meeting considered that the attitude of the delegation was appropriate when the Far Eastern Games were illegally dissolved by Japan and the Philippines. Other than that, we will continue to recognize the organizational system of the Far Eastern Games and will not issue any other statements. In the future, we will focus on the World Games to learn from each other. The telegram from Danish Minister Luo Zhongxian, who represented the delegation at the International Amateur Athletic Conference held in Sweden, has already been sent out. Due to funding issues, we will send athletes with the best records to participate in the World Games in the future. Approximately the entire football team can go, and only a few outstanding athletes are planned to be sent for track and field events. Other decisions have not yet been made.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Occupations of University Students</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th. Wang Yongbin, Chairman of the Examination Committee, issued a statement on the 15th regarding the employment problems of college students, stating briefly that this was originally not a problem. In the past, the employment law was not fully implemented, and there were side doors for employment, and graduates had alternate routes. Agencies had other sources for hiring, which led to it becoming a problem. At present, the only thing to do is to revise the employment law. As long as the central and local agencies follow the employment law to hire people, the employment problems of a few thousand college graduates will not be a problem. The various examinations held by the Examination Yuan and the temporary examinations held by various agencies are all ways to solve the employment problems of college students. At this year's Examination and Qualification Conference, the Examination Committee will put forward concrete measures to solve this problem.</p>

I have personally advocated for and promoted vocational education in writing. The government is now gradually focusing on production education. The holding of summer workshops for science teachers in middle schools also proves that the trend of education is moving towards vocational subjects. We know that culture is not an empty concept; it is something practical. Humanity uses intellectual ability to create and utilize nature and materials. The work of finding solutions to human life and national survival in this process is cultural work. Education is simply the promotion of culture. Therefore, without creating or utilizing materials and nature, culture has no value. If education deviates from promoting national culture, the result is futile. History proves this. The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, as well as the sage Confucius, also engaged in practical work with natural science, which is why they were respected by the people. However, later generations gradually buried this, leading to the decline of Chinese culture day by day. Therefore, from now on, those engaged in cultural and educational work must have a spirit of researching vocational subjects, and so on.</p>
<h3>Director's Admonition</h3>
<p>Next, Director Pan's address roughly stated: Ordinary people misunderstand that culture is something related to literature, so they focus on liberal arts and forget about vocational subjects. In fact, culture cannot be encompassed by vocational subjects alone; it includes both aspects. However, we must now shift social trends and make everyone pay attention to vocational subjects. We must work hard in this area. Those who serve as science teachers in secondary schools, in particular, must take responsibility. The fact that middle school students are not interested in science proves that Chinese culture has been focused on moral teachings for thousands of years, resulting in the current situation where interest in natural science has not been cultivated. Like the New Culture Movement, its scope has become too narrow, turning into a dispute over words. In the past, there was a dispute between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese, and now there is a dispute between vernacular Chinese and mass language. If we want to revitalize national culture and build a new culture, everyone must absolutely avoid this kind of textual dispute. We must enable those who study science to work hard in the cultural movement, and then a new Chinese culture can be built, and so on. Finally, speeches were given by President Li of Jiaotong University, President Cao of Datong, and guest Gu Cheng, among others. Student Dai Yuheng gave a response. The ceremony concluded around 12 o'clock, followed by a group photo, and then attendees dispersed. This city</p>

<p>Returned to Shanghai yesterday and told reporters from Guomin News Agency: Former Vice Minister of Communications and President of National Jinan University, Mr. Zheng Hongnian, went to Beiping last month and arrived in Shanghai from Beiping by the Beijing-Shanghai express train last night. The reporter visited him at his residence and learned that the board of directors of Beiping Civilian College had indeed invited Mr. Zheng to concurrently serve as president. However, because Mr. Zheng could not reside in Beiping for a long time, he only used his qualifications as a director to promote the development of college affairs.

Construction is now underway.</p>

<p>The yarn market continues to weaken due to the decline in raw cotton prices, which has fundamentally weakened the market. Moreover, current yarn sales are relatively sluggish. The yarn and cloth warehouse still has more than 34,000 bales of yarn in stock. With this huge amount of inventory, there is no movement, and the pressure on the yarn market is still difficult to alleviate. However, financial groups have purchased a huge amount of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 bales, mostly for forward contracts. Japanese short sellers also have 40,000 to 50,000 bales. Therefore, the competition between the long and short sides is quite intense.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Drops by One Yuan and More</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, American cotton fell by 15 points per pound. The atmosphere in the market was flat and there was a lack of major buyers. Prices fell by 2.2-3 points. It was heard that the news about spot yarn was not as good as the previous day. Some of the general floating longs closed out their positions. As a result, prices for each month fell by 4.5, 7, 8, and 9 jiao. In the afternoon, as raw cotton prices eased, the longs also did not come to buy. The market became increasingly loose. The second and third sessions were quite weak. However, by the close, some profit-takers covered their positions, causing prices to rise by 4 and 5 jiao. As a result, prices for each month fell by 3, 4, 5, and 8 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 52,700 bales. It was found that Shenchang sold 1,950 bales, Jifeng 800 bales, Dafu 800 bales, Tongfu 700 bales, Runkang 750 bales, Dafeng 1,500 bales, Huikang 1,450 bales, Yuande 1,100 bales, Shenji 750 bales, and Mingde 700 bales.

<h3>Spot Yarn Also Drops by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are relatively low. It was found that various groups bought a total of 1,100 bales for the day. Prices were down by a small amount of 5 jiao. The purchase amounts of various groups are listed below: Sichuan 170, Ningbo 50, Northern Groups 50, Nanyang 15, Inland 170, Changsha 35, Fellow Traders 105, Xiamen 15, Guangdong 490, Jiangxi 50, Wuhu 10.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Very Weak</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weakening day by day, and the situation is quite weak. With good news about the new cotton crop, Ningbo Yao cotton and Shanghai Huoji cotton should be on the market soon. In previous years, at this time, factories from China and abroad would sell and buy forward cotton contracts. However, this year, factories from China and abroad are all refraining from doing so. Therefore, general spot traders are extremely fearful, so the market is becoming more and more difficult to stabilize. The October and November futures contracts have broken through the 5 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Breaks the Five Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, although American cotton fell, the atmosphere in the market was still calm. Due to continuous declines for many days, floating shorts covered their positions, and prices for each month rose by 5 fen. However, by the second and third sessions, the situation suddenly changed and selling pressure rose again. The reason for this was that new cotton would soon be gradually entering the market, and all factories had no activity news. General spot traders felt particularly panicked. Prices for each month fell again by 5 fen to 1, 2, and 3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot cotton manufacturers still had no intention of buying, and the selling pressure intensified again. In the second session, the October and November futures contracts broke through the 5 yuan mark. Profit-takers covered their positions at the close, slightly rebounding prices. As a result, prices for each month fell again by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 165,500 dan. It was found that Junchang sold 1,800 dan, Shenchang 1,800 dan, Mingde 4,800 dan, Dafeng 3,800 dan, Renfeng 4,400 dan, Runkang 3,600 dan, Changhe 7,500 dan, Hongchang 2,800 dan, Yifeng 4,400 dan, Tonghe 1,500 dan, and Changfeng 1,600 dan. Jinchang bought 2,700 dan, Jifeng 3,400 dan, Hengyi 3,400 dan, Yicheng 3,000 dan, Xincheng 3,300 dan, Taixing 2,400 dan, Huikang 3,300 dan, Gengfeng 3,200 dan, Ruida 3,200 dan, Changfeng 2,300 dan, Xiesheng 2,200 dan, and Dachang 2,200 dan.

<h3>Spot Cotton Mills are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Spot cotton demand remains sluggish. Mills are purchasing very little. The source of cotton is 150 bales of Yao cotton. The selling prices are listed on the left: Tongzhou Cotton 41.40, Dongmianhangjin 200 bales, wharf delivery.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales Cause American Cotton to Decline</h3>
<p>Poor weather reports for American cotton, but offset by sluggish spot sales and reactive selling. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points per pound, and futures prices fell by 13 to 16 points per pound. British cotton futures fell by 7 to 8 points. Indian cotton was firm at first due to buying by brokers and Japanese traders, but later softened due to selling by speculators. As a result, Pingguoer fell by 7.5 jiao, Aomula fell by 1 rupee and 7.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left: (Telegram on the 14th) American Cotton Change from Previous Day Equivalent to National Currency British Cotton Change from Previous Day Equivalent to National Currency October 13.33 Down 15 41.90 8 6.95 Down 8 46.50 December 13.47 Down 13 42.30 9 6.94 Down 8 46.20 January 13.52 Down 14 42.50 10 6.92 Down 8 46.00 March 13.63 Down 14 42.80 November 6.91 Down 7 45.90 May 13.69 Down 15 43.00 December 6.91 Down 7 45.90 July 13.75 Down 16 43.20 Spot 13.15 Down 15 42.20 Pingguoer 144.00 Down 0.75 22.40 Aomula 201.00 Down 1.75 31.30 Bailuoxi 223.00 Down 2.00 34.60 Grain, wheat is under a heavy blow of declining prices.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Re-enter a Sluggish Path</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a weakening and soft trend. With the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by about 5-7 jiao, and Canada fell by about 1-2 jiao. When the normal price was opened, the market was weak. The opening price of this month was short by 3 fen, and the forward price also fell by 2-3 fen in secret. Most of the gradual weakness of the market was due to the poor quotation of foreign wheat, and although the factory did not pay attention to the pricing of the current foreign wheat, the order of Argentina was often between 5.9 yuan. With this situation, people inside and outside the industry could not help but reduce their interest. In addition, the trading margin of the exchange still needs 500 yuan, and the speculative activities are invisibly reduced, so the transaction is reduced, and the market is easily in a state of depression. Until the opening in the afternoon, the market was soft again. Although Jinbang still made purchases this month, the surrounding air was bad, and it finally fell. It was heard that the long positions were returning in the long term, and there were very few new buyers, and the same entered a scene of unbearable sluggishness. If it does not sink later, it depends on how the quotation of foreign wheat is. As a result, this month fell 6 fen, September fell 5 fen, November fell 6 fen, December fell 6 and a half fen, and January fell 6 and 7 half fen. After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market for each month was generally calm. With the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago was about 5-7 jiao, and Canada was less than 1-2 jiao. The opening price for this month was 3.9 yuan, and it has not been opened since. Due to the lack of buyers in the forward months, the market was weak and fell by 4-5 fen compared with the previous day. Until the opening in the afternoon, the transaction was still light, and the market was still weak. The good reason is that after the sharp rise, it is met with a sharp drop, and the future situation is not stable. Outside buyers feel that the hope is reduced and have no intention to ask. Although half of the market's entry and exit must be matched by the award, half of the market's entry and exit is also a key point. As a result, August fell 1 corner and 1 point compared with the previous day, September fell 9 points, October fell 1 corner and 2 points, November fell 1 corner and 1 point, and December fell 1 corner. In the spot wheat market, large factories still firmly reject entry, and the line is not willing to open easily because of the loss. It is estimated that the Bengbu Suzhou Mingguang wheat will open at 4 yuan, a total of 5,000 bags, and will be handled by small factories.</p>
<h3>New Rice from Various Places Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xiaojiao Rice Rose by Half a Yuan or So The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Proves Zhangzhou Rice Yesterday, the foreign Kexian market was booming in both arrival and sales, and the market was excellent. The arrival was mostly new rice from Hunan, Shasha, and Anhui. Annam rice transferred from Hong Kong, and new rice from Taizhou and Zhangzhou were also intermittently arriving. However, the way out was more active. The inland areas such as Hu-Ning, Hu-Hang, and Yong each had a strong appetite, and purchases continued for days. Yesterday, all the newly arrived new and old rice from Hunan Shashi Taizhou Chuzhou was swept away, totaling more than 3,000 bags of Hunan rice, 2,000 bags of Shashi brown rice, 2,000 bags of Chuzhou rice, and 305 bags of Taizhou rice, all of which were handled by the inland areas. The price rose by several points to one or two corners. The street handled a total of 733 bags of Annam japonica and Zhangzhou new rice. Therefore, the rice shops on the street used these two kinds of incoming goods, which are similar to japonica rice, to mix and mix them into the Changbang rice and various kinds of japonica rice. However, it was reported a few days ago that some Taiwan rice was transferred from Xiamen to Shanghai in order to avoid half of the tax, so Zhangzhou new rice was also suspected of being Taiwan rice. However, according to experienced people in the bean and rice industry, Zhangzhou rice is different from Taiwan rice, and Taiwan's new rice has not yet been released and the market price is high, so they are determined not to sell it at a loss. Now it is suspected by all parties and customs as foreign rice. It is heard that the customs is analyzing it and suspects that it is Saigon rice. Yesterday, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Municipal Grain Association at the request of 16 grain firms to prove that it was indeed Zhangzhou new rice. It was found that the first batch of Zhangzhou rice was about 800 bags, and this was the second batch, totaling tens of thousands of bags, which were packed in several rounds. The large quantity aroused people's attention. The Quanzhang Guild Hall also sent a letter to the Grain Association yesterday to prove this. It is heard that the rice has a very damp body and may be difficult to store for a long time. In short, this misunderstanding is actually because Zhangzhou has never transported rice to Shanghai, and the incoming goods are similar to japonica rice, which caused this suspicion. In fact, the Shanghai market is soaring, but the price in Fujian Province is low. The high price attracts distant customers, which is the way for merchants to make money. Yesterday, Xiaojiao rice was purchased by Jiujiang and Beiyang gangs in addition to inland inquiries. The stock on the market was scarce, and the hoarding households were optimistic. The price first opened at 10 yuan, and then rose to 10 yuan and 2 jiao, which has increased by half a yuan compared to the price of 9 yuan and 7 jiao the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Trend Downward</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of Nanmi from each gang was the 16th and 17th (a total of 2,700 to 800 shi). At first, it seemed that it could stand a little, and the situation showed signs of stabilizing. The customer gang was holding, but suddenly the Qingdao gang took action to handle it. However, each house has strict eating dishes, and they are difficult to match, and 80 bags of Sijing special goods were traded, and the market was softened again. The sales market in this street turned dull, and the market situation returned to a downward trend. Prices stepped down, and the market prices of each thick japonica and late rice continued to be repaired by about one corner. Doyang Jianhushixiaochiqi, cloudy change yuan accompanied by softness, the new japonica is still opening at 11 yuan and 2 jiao. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 7-8 boats from various places in Hexia came with various goods to the stomach, Baigeng took the opportunity to be slightly softened, and the price was slightly about one corner. Baiyuan's stomach was weak and weak, and the price also tended to be weak. Yang Dujian's arrival and sales were both harmonious, and the price was flat. Ke Jian picked and chose to pay, and the price was weak outside the corner. Dongxin was reluctant to stand up. Commercial news</p>
<h3>Financial</h3>
<p>Swap premium steps lower</p>
<h3>Gold Standard Stubbornly Weak</h3>
<p>▲Fell Back Three Dollars and Eight Cents: Retreating into the Fifty Dollar Range▲ - August: 1197 contracts ▲Glimpse of Trading Volume｜- September: 8211 contracts - October: 42539 contracts</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially rose upon opening due to declining exchange rates. Unexpectedly, the swap rates opened with exceptionally cheap discounts. Major bulls aggressively dumped their positions, causing the discounts to steadily decrease. The selling pressure intensified within the market, and the market situation became unsustainable, eventually retreating into the fifty-dollar range. Early in the morning, news from overseas indicated a slight rise in the Bank of England, with London spot gold down half a penny. Exchange rates also narrowed, U.S. cotton fell by fifteen points, U.S. wheat fell by 1.625 points, and stocks declined slightly. Sentiment was still positive, mainly because the U.S. Treasury Department's announcement of issuing $80 million in silver certificates was not interpreted as approaching inflation. Off-exchange forward trading rose to fifty-five or fifty-six dollars. After the opening, although banks tended to be congested and engaged in forward swaps, bulls only offered discounts of four or five dollars. Selling pressure suddenly intensified, leading to a decline of four dollars. However, at this time, it was known in advance that HSBC was posting rates, with British rates flat and U.S. rates narrowing by 1.25, allowing for a rebound. Ultimately, major bulls actively dumped their positions, causing discounts to steadily decrease. General bulls believed there was no profit to be made, and hedging transactions occurred. For a time, supply exceeded demand in the market, gradually moving downstream. Although the foreign exchange market was stable and banks were again buying forward U.S. dollars, there were many rebounds along the way, but the differences were minimal. It was easier for prices to fall than to rise, eventually retreating into the fifty-dollar range. Bargain hunters were still willing to be active, but trading was not particularly robust. There were two more rebounds, but the fifty-dollar mark ultimately lacked the strength to hold. This was because today was the last day of trading for the September contracts, and those who considered the swap discounts unfavorable were actively settling their positions. The underlying trend remained soft at noon. Reuters also reported that U.S. Senator Thomas stated today that various countries would sell their gold before abandoning gold as an international currency unit. He did not trust his prediction that countries would add silver to their monetary base or use one ounce of gold as the legal unit, which slightly affected market sentiment. The gold price was calculated at 970 dollars and 20 cents. The September/October spread was quoted, with bulls offering a discount of three dollars. The market situation for the first half of the day will be recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 955 dollars and 20 cents, up two dollars from the previous close. Goods opened at four dollars and eighty cents. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 5625, U.S. exchange at 35 dollars 25 cents. Anda released September U.S. dollars at 375, with Fuyu Yuanmao Yongheng Yu Dade Chenglai selling. Huabi Sai November U.S. dollars at 625, gradually decreasing to one dollar and forty cents. It was known in advance that HSBC posted British rates flat and U.S. rates narrowing by 1.25. Citibank bought November U.S. dollars at 6875, with Dafa Yongfu Changxiang Hehengyu Yuansheng Yongda Decheng Changsheng Yongda Xingyong and others joining forces to buy contracts. Although Yuanmao Yong came to sell aggressively, there was a slight struggle to rebound to three dollars and twenty cents, but the swap discounts were still cheap. Yuanchun Dingkang Yuqing Yong sold to within two dollars. At this time, the swap stabilized briefly, and Shunlai bought, rising to two and a half dollars. However, due to Pan'gen Helan releasing November U.S. dollars at 62 dollars, Yifeng Yong Yuqing Yong Hengyu Fuxing Yong sold contracts, falling to 0.2 cents. Megali bought December U.S. dollars at 8125, still able to rise to one dollar and ten cents. Hengyu Shengda came to sell, the swap was still cheap, and it broke the fifty-dollar mark. Goods Yifeng Yong Shunmao took advantage of the cheap price to take in contracts, and rebounded to fifty-one dollars and a half. Tianfeng Bingxing Fuyu and others repeatedly sold contracts, further falling to forty-eight dollars and eighty cents. Bingxing Dadecheng took advantage of the low price to buy, rebounding to 0.5 cents. At this time, the situation revolved. When Tianfeng Qian Changxiang Yongli Ruixing sold, it fell again to forty-eight dollars and seventy cents. Yifeng Yong Yong Liyicheng bought in at low prices, gradually rebounding. HSBC bought December U.S. dollars at 8125, and Yuqing Yong Yuanchang Yong also bought, rising to fifty dollars and four cents. Huabi released November U.S. dollars at 625, and Dachangxiang divested, retreating into the fifty-dollar range. Ultimately, because today was the last trading day for the September contracts, the swap had retreated to within two dollars, so sellers surged, and retail investors also pressed down. Hengyu Qian Changxiang Huixiang also sold, falling to forty-eight dollars and a half. Fuchang and others slightly bought, and after revolving, the noon close was 949 dollars and 40 cents, with goods at 9 dollars and 80 cents. After the close, it was flat. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 955 dollars and 20 cents, and the lowest price was 948 dollars and a half, with a total of six dollars and seventy cents rising and falling. As a result, it fell back three dollars and eight cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on HSBC's U.S. exchange rate posting narrowing by 1.25, was 35 dollars, equivalent to a gold price of 988 dollars, 50 cents and 7 points. According to the closing price, it was pressed down by approximately 39 dollars, 7 dollars more than the previous close. This month's registration was 953 dollars, September was 949 dollars, and October was 947 dollars. The morning water supplement was 953 dollars, and the gold price was 970 dollars and 20 cents, approximately 15 dollars more. Trading in the market was calm. Dadecheng sold a total of about 700 taels to the Tianjin gang, approximately 20 dollars more. Otherwise, no wholesale transactions were heard. Those who released public orders on the day included Qian Changxiang 294 contracts, Yingfeng Heng 161 contracts, Dadecheng 140 contracts, and Tongfeng Heng 63 contracts. Those who bought included Fuchang 336 contracts, Wanxing 182 contracts, and Shunli 140 contracts.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In summary, Shunli Yongde Shunmao Tongchun Hengxing Yuan Dadecheng Hengyu Hengtai Huixiang Fuxing Yong Futai Hengxiang Hechangsheng Yong and others were on the buying side, while Yuqing Yong Yuanmao Yong Yingfeng Heng Yifeng Yong Shengda Hong Kang Yong Fuyu Dingkang Dingtai Dingchang Fu'an Tianfeng and others were on the selling side. The Dalian gang Shunli made a total of about 800 contracts, squeezed in about 500 contracts. Wanxing made a total of over 500 contracts, and the squeeze was flat. The Guangdong gang Shengda had few transactions, and so did Hengxing, but there were book entries. The total number of transactions on the day for September totaled 100,888 contracts.</p>
<p>For this session's September/October spread, off-exchange initially called for buyers to offer discounts of five or six dollars. Yuan Yi and others wanted to swap but did not get it, because Fuchang Fu'an Dadecheng Chunyuan Yong immediately offered discounts and retreated to within four dollars. Fuyu Qingyu Hongli Qian Changxiang Zhengchang Neixing offered discounts, rising to outside of four dollars. However, Chunyuan Yong Yiyu Fuchang Yongli Yuan Yi Qingfa Yong Tongfeng Heng Dingkang Dadecheng successively offered discounts, retreating to three dollars and forty cents. Tongchun Yuanchang Yong Senchang Yong Tianfeng Yong Daxing Yong Futai Heng took advantage of the cheap price to offer discounts, rebounding one dollar. Yuanheng Yu Qingyong Hengyu Fuxing Yong offered discounts, and hovered. Fuchang Yifeng Yong Wanxing came again to offer discounts, falling to within three dollars. Yuanmao Yong Yuan Yi Zhengchang offered discounts, and the official opening was with sellers offering discounts of three dollars. Fuchang Yifeng Yong offered discounts, retreating to within two and a half dollars. At this time, Yuanmao Yong Shunmao Tianfeng Yong Shenkang Huixiang had some discounts and stabilized. Wanxing Hengxingyuan Hengyu Dadecheng then came to offer discounts and struggled. When Wanxing aggressively offered discounts, it retreated to two dollars. Wanxing Yifeng Yong Fuyu Fuchang Cuitai and others then came to offer discounts, further retreating to within one dollar. After this, the situation was idle. After general retail contracts came to offer discounts, buyers stopped activities, and rebounded to two dollars. Unexpectedly, bulls came to offer discounts again at high prices. Fuchang Yuansheng Yong Qingfa Yong had slight activity, retreating to one dollar and a half. Yicheng Yuanchun and others offered discounts. The noon close was with buyers offering discounts of one dollar and sixty cents. After the close, although Yifeng Yong had discounts, because Yuqing Yong Fuyu Yiyu and goods offered discounts, it rose to outside of two dollars. Wanxing Yuqing Yong offered discounts and went downstream. Zhentai tended to offer discounts, and contended between one dollar and seventy or eighty cents. Swap trading was extremely active, and bulls offered discounts even more strongly.</p>

The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 5625 and 625 paired, U.S. exchange at 35 dollars 25 cents. Compared to the previous close, British exchange was tight by 0.03125 and U.S. exchange was tight by 0.125. After opening, banks' appetite tended to be congested, but because HSBC's postings were revealed, British exchange was flat and U.S. exchange narrowed by 1.25, the process was still tight. Banks also slightly bought forward exchange. After entering, although the gold standard fell due to swaps, the foreign exchange market only managed to remain flat and did not harden. Later, as banks favored the near term, the situation hardened slightly, but Chinese merchants still paid in, and banks also bought forward exchange at cheap prices, so the market situation was extremely mediocre and hovering. Foreign firms slightly settled British exchange. By the noon close, recent selling prices were British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 625 and U.S. exchange at 35 dollars 3125. Compared to the previous close, British exchange was flat and U.S. exchange was slightly tighter. The half-day situation was flat. Chinese merchants bought about 200,000 U.S. dollars, while the purchase of shillings was small. The half-day transaction prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Foreign Goods Circulation Active, Remittances Frequent</h3>
<p>Recently, the silver dollar market has seen increased activity due to autumn goods urgently awaiting listing, coupled with the repeated occurrence of disasters in various regions. Speculators have actively placed orders for grain overseas, resulting in a significant increase in imports of foreign rice and wheat. Other imported goods have also been substantial, leading to advance payments for orders reaching over two million. The market has become very active. However, since China's rural bankruptcy, the purchasing power of all sectors has been weak, and the market inventory is still sufficient, so optimism is not warranted. In the market, foreign exchange discounts were 7 cents for both morning and noon markets. Overdrafts were initially 5 cents, then changed to 4 cents. Early market trading of exchange notes saw 3.9 million in transaction in the morning market and over 200,000 in the afternoon. Transactions in the small General Association totaled over 300,000. Foreign currency loans saw over 800,000 redeemed and over 1.4 million newly done. Bank remittances were quite busy. Foreign banks remitted over 2.7 million in notes, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlements, and over 5.2 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral. 800,000 worth of goods were released from warehouses. Chinese banks remitted over 3.4 million in notes, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlements, over 800,000 in customs duties, and over 5.3 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral. 500,000 worth of goods were entered into warehouses. Japanese banks remitted over 2.6 million in notes, over 5.3 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral, and over 2.4 million in foreign exchange settlements. 800,000 worth of goods were entered into warehouses. Money shops received over 47 million in public foreign exchange notes, and over 7.8 million in foreign exchange overdrafts. Over 600,000 in banknotes were redeemed and over 1.1 million were issued. Over 500,000 were redeemed in cash, and various remittances totaled over 600,000, with incoming and outgoing remittances from various routes each totaling 300,000. Also, the total amount exchanged at the local clearinghouse on the 15th was 11,181,636.08 silver dollars, including 4,659,986.17 silver dollars and 7,156,377.91 silver dollars in exchange transfers. Copper coins were shipped to Dalian.</p>
<h3>Sudden Rise of Two to Three Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for copper coins suddenly tightened due to the shipment of 400,000 to 500,000 copper coins to Dalian. Jiangnan small coins were priced at 834 dollars in the morning market and 834 dollars and 20 cents in the afternoon market, an increase of 2.20 dollars compared to the previous day's transactions. Transactions involved 6,000 copper coins in the morning market and 8,000 copper coins in the afternoon market. Guangdong small coins were priced at 733 dollars and 50 cents in the morning market and 734 dollars in the afternoon market, an increase of 3 dollars compared to the previous day. Transactions involved 130,000 copper coins in the morning market and 70,000 copper coins in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 332,000 cash, with transactions amounting to 8,800 foreign dollars, equivalent to 29,216 strings of cash.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Unanimously Fell</h3>
<p>From One Two Cents to Six Seven Cents Difference</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange weakened again, and sentiment was not boosted at all. Although it was said that bandits were rampant in Fujian Province, it was generally recognized that they were just clowns jumping around and not worth paying attention to. However, sentiment was not invigorated, and those who went long were not enthusiastic at all. Major sellers continued to sell daily, while buyers were rare. As a result, there was no power to rise. In terms of the environment, there was no adverse news at present. The Fujian affair was not worth worrying about, and there should be a turning point in the future. However, it was still necessary to wait for the cessation of selling by major players. Yesterday, the opening was extremely stable because there were few speculators, so fluctuations were small. There was selling as soon as the troop reduction began, falling by about 4 cents, and the rest followed suit. Sellers focused on the 16th, with only the 23rd showing a slight improvement of one cent. The second session continued to fall, even more so than the first session. The 5th and 16th continued to sell, and prices unanimously continued to fall, a full six cents and four and a half cents, and the 23rd fell by as much as eight and a half cents. From this, it can be seen that short sellers also had followers. The market's turning point should wait for the rumors to subside. Yesterday's market results showed a fall of one to two cents to six to seven cents. The total number of transactions totaled 11,170,500. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (units in dollars, transaction units in hundreds of dollars):</p>
<p>(Table with several security and public bond classes, with columns for type, current period, highest, lowest, change from previous day, and transaction volume.)</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Stagnant and Trending Lower</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (the 14th) the stock market was stagnant and prices showed mixed declines. The Treasury's announcement that the nationalization of silver did not imply inflation caused silver stocks to plummet. Although speculators were not pessimistic, they also had no reason to continue to support the market. Railroad, automobile, chemical, and agricultural tool stocks all followed silver stocks lower. Steel stocks fell due to poor work volume reports. In the small exchanges, public utility and silver mining stocks were sold off sporadically, preventing the market from rebounding. The bond market followed U.S. government bonds with mixed slight gains, followed by railroad bonds. The fall in goods reflected speculators' changed interpretation of the nationalization of silver and also the cessation of the Midwest heat. Total daily volume was 530,000 shares.

<h3>Miaozhong Customs and Scenery (1)</h3>
<p>— Jue</p>
<p>Where Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces meet, the Miao people have resided since ancient times, and their temperament and customs are truly distinct from those of the Han people. Because they live in mountain villages, amidst overlapping ridges and deep, obstructed streams, our Han people rarely venture there. Consequently, we know little about the customs and scenery of Miaozhong. A friend of mine, working in Qianzhong, has traveled extensively throughout the three provinces for many years. He is well-versed in Miao affairs and has described the Miao customs and scenery in detail, entrusting me to write it down so that those who are concerned about world affairs can gain a general understanding of Miaozhong.</p>
<p>The old site of the Miao border wall starts from Tingzi Pass, northeast around Langzhong River, to Shenghua Sentinel past Changping, turning north towards Niuyan Lutang, to Gaolou Sentinel Deshengying, then north to Mulinwan Creek, around Qianchengzhen Creek, and northwest to Liangzhang Camp Xique Camp as the end. The Miao people living outside the border wall are called Raw Miao, while those living inside the border wall are called Cooked Miao, interspersed with Han villages. They either rent and cultivate Han fields, pay taxes, and perform corvée labor, no different from the people in the interior.</p>
<p>Mount La'er, located between Chu (Hunan) and Qian (Guizhou), is divided and governed by Guizhou Zhenyuan Dao, belonging to Shengxi and Songtao counties, and they are called Qian Miao. Those divided and governed by Hunan Chenyuan Dao, belonging to Fenghuang, Qiancheng, Yongshui, and other counties, are called Chu Miao. However, there is little difference between the temperament and customs of Qian Miao and Chu Miao.</p>
<p>The Miao people living in Fenghuang, Qiancheng, and Yongshui counties in Hunan are divided into ten li (a traditional Chinese unit of distance). The upper six li are called Red Miao, and the lower four li are called Lei Miao. Therefore, Yongshui County is entirely six li of Red Miao. The locals refer to the area around Huangguazhai in the west of the county, and the villages of Yayu and Lilin in the south of the county as Black Miao. The area where Pingcha Cave La'er Fort in the north of the county borders Baojing and Xiushan County, which belongs to Sichuan Dongchuan Dao, is a mix of Black Miao and Tujia.</p>
<p>The Red Miao villages have many people and are feared by other tribes, while the Black Miao land is fierce and resistant. In short, the Red Miao are more numerous than the Black Miao, and the Black Miao are fiercer than the Red Miao. Therefore, since ancient times, the Miao people who gather crowds to cause trouble are usually Black Miao.</p>
<p>The Raw Miao are divided into separate villages. Those located at the intersection of Songtao County in Guizhou, and Fenghuang, Qiancheng, and Yongshui counties in Hunan are geographically connected, like interlocking teeth. They have tribes but no chiefs. Their custom does not value human life. If there are several fathers, sons, brothers, or dozens of strong and combative individuals in a village, the village fears them and jointly elect them as leaders. If there is another household or individual like this in the village, they will form their own factions. Therefore, there is one leader per village, or several leaders per village, all of whom change and replace each other based on strength and weakness, unlike other tribes with chiefs who inherit their rule.</p>
<p>The Miao people with the surnames Wu, Long, Shi, Ma, and Liao are considered True Miao. The surnames Yang, Shi, Peng, Zhang, and Hong are outsiders who married into the Miao and learned their customs, thus forming a clan.</p>
<p>Miao men are often named with the word "Old" (老), such as Lao Ou, Lao Bu, Lao Bi, Lao Ba, Lao Tie, Lao Qiao, Lao San, Lao Sou, and Lao Zai. Miao women are often named with the word "A" (阿), such as A Sou, A Zhong, A Pa, A Mei, A Ji, A Jin, A Xi, and A Bu.</p>
<p>The Miao people do not know how to write. Fathers pass down knowledge to their sons, using the rat, ox, tiger, and horse to mark the years. However, this secretly aligns with the calendar. They are good at remembering, but fearing forgetfulness, they tie knots on ropes to create contracts and carve on wood for talismans and letters. The customs of ancient times are still preserved in today's Miaozhong. Recently, some Miao children have shown talent in learning, carrying several liters of miscellaneous rice to study phrases and sentences with Han people. Among them, the intelligent ones can understand the meaning of the text.</p>
<p>The Miao people build thatched huts on the mountainsides and live in them. Some also build tiled houses, but without any order or direction, and without windows.</p>
<p>Each house has three to five rooms, with five or six pillars per room. The eaves and doors are low and small. A bed is set on the right, four or five feet high, with a stove in the middle for cooking, sitting, and sleeping. This is called a fire bed. Parents-in-law, daughters-in-law, brothers, and sisters-in-law live together without any avoidance. Only the couple shares a quilt. When a daughter grows up, she sets up a separate bed on the right. Guests stay in their homes, and they are allowed to live together without being considered strange. Cattle, horses, chickens, and dogs all live underneath, unaware of the filth. The Miao people do not live in a fixed place because once someone dies in a room, they move to another place.</p>
<h3>Newly Built Structures Soon Become Historical Sites</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Mr. Qi Fanwu recently published a collection of short essays, called "Small Series," Volume 1, "Notes from the Cowherding Hermitage," which contains a passage about the Zhou family's sutra pillar: "(Zhou Meigu of Jin Gui handwritten the Diamond Sutra with five thousand words and had it carved on a stone pillar erected at the foot of Tiger Hill.)" But when we go to Tiger Hill now, we can no longer find this sutra pillar. It turned out that this sutra pillar was erected on the Thousand Men Stone, forcibly chiseling a hole in an ancient and natural stone slope, truly fitting the Suzhou saying "a sore growing on good meat." At the time, only a few people knew about it. Later, when it was巍然 established, everyone was deeply surprised, thinking that the Thousand Men Stone was a historical site and should not be destroyed. Furthermore, the Zhou family's sutra pillar was to celebrate his mother's longevity, a private virtue with no broad implications. Therefore, people like Chen Peiren from the past, in the name of the Antiquities Preservation Society, had the sutra pillar destroyed. But the hole on the Thousand Men Stone still exists, and even pouring cement cannot erase the traces. A newly built structure becoming a historical site in less than a year is also an interesting thing.</p>
<p>The Zhi Yuan, which was rebuilt and expanded from the Fengchi Nunnery by Cheng Xuelou, also became desolate and dilapidated in just a few years. A part of it was enclosed by the provincial middle school and turned into a campus, and a part of it was left for the courtyard flowers to fall freely. At that time, there were also a few thatched huts where one could sit for a while, but now there is nothing left. When we accidentally pass by outside the garden, we can still see the fallen leaves inside forming a shade and the horizontal branches like a weave, but not many people can point and say, "This is Zhi Yuan." It has almost become a historical site. Now someone wants to tidy up the area around the Confucius Temple Zhi Yuan, perhaps to open it as a park or build a school, which is very meaningful. Originally, this area was too desolate, and the menacing Ruiguang Pagoda stood in the distance, forming a kind of gloomy ghost market scene, which made "Lengshui Panmen" unable to increase its temperature. I hope the people of Suzhou work hard!</p>
<h3>Dancing Craze</h3>
<p>— Hong E</p>
<p>Recently, the most fashionable pastime in Shanghai is dancing, and open-air dance halls are especially popular during this hot summer. Exclusive beauties and noble ladies, every night at midnight, after a short nap, after a fresh bath, put on mist robes, ride motorcycles, and rush to the western suburbs. There, it is like a sea of flowers, with the sounds of strings and pipes like spring. In the gentle breeze, they perform the graceful dances of celestial nymphs. With jade bones and icy skin, they are cool and sweat-free. When tired, they either sip snacks or enjoy cold drinks, then drive their electric vehicles around North Xinjing and Xujiahui and return. At that time, the morning light is slightly joyful, and the morning breeze brushes their faces. Then they spread out peach mats and lay ice mats, falling into a dream like Handan, completely unaware that the east has already turned white. This is how the bourgeoisie finds ways to escape the heat, without having to travel far to Lushan or Qingdao.</p>
<p>In the past, those who frequented dance halls were mostly frivolous young men. Since important Party and state figures have come to Shanghai for vacations and have made it a pleasure to set foot in dance halls, business tycoons and famous figures in society have followed suit, viewing dancing as a noble entertainment for stretching muscles and learning etiquette. Therefore, the business of dance halls has not declined for a long time. Poor girls compete to learn dance skills to earn a living. Those who are skilled can earn more than half a tael of silver per month, not only ensuring food and clothing for their families, but some even live like kings and nobles, living in Western-style buildings and traveling by motorcycle. This has led parents all over the world to value daughters more than sons, as daughters can become dance partners, surpassing those who accumulate money year after year. Social trends are like strong winds bending the grass. How can we not be afraid!</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of dancing, the Meihua Troupe and Xinhua Troupe have emerged. The price of a ticket for the opera "Grand Dance for One Yuan" is surprisingly high, with the auditorium full of people. The dances on the stage are interspersed in Zhang Xunzi's "Red Goat Heroes," with the dance time accounting for one-fifth. The dance skills are directly inherited from Li Jinhui, and the cost of a dance costume is more than thirty gold coins. With abundant wealth and good business acumen, they make the beauties of the Gehua and Xinhua troupes pale in comparison. It can be said that they are good at speculation.</p>
<h3>Records of Fleeting Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But this dog's appearance was somewhat similar to a sea otter. Perhaps the Empress Dowager felt that the word "sea otter" was not very pleasant, so she changed it to "dragon." This dog was a true Pekingese, with deep brown fur all over its body, but on its neck and head, it wore a large cluster of long hair as white as silver, resembling the hair of an old person. Its body was very short and small, its legs were short and bent, like the back of a bow, its nose was flat and shaved, and its eyes were particularly large. I can say that I have never seen a dog with such large eyes. Judging by its strange appearance, it must be one of the best dogs in Beijing. Therefore, the Empress Dowager was extremely fond of this little creature, even admiring it. Every night, she had to have it lie in that small court. But since it was a dog beloved by the Empress Dowager, it could not lie on the ground casually like ordinary people's dogs. It had a bamboo basket as its bed. This bamboo basket was very large, large enough to fit a small child, and it was lined with very beautiful red satin. Those who didn't know the details would never have thought that this was something for a dog to lie on. But it was not just this extravagant. The Empress Dowager also specifically appointed a eunuch to be responsible for serving this lucky little dog day and night. It certainly also had clothes, which was a kind of armor like a horse's armor, with a red tribute satin face and a lining of the softest leather. There were also three gold bells tied around its neck, two smaller ones on the sides and one particularly large one in the middle. As long as it walked, ran, or jumped around, it would play a simple music on its own body. Behind the collar around its neck, right next to its ears, there were two things like hat badges that soldiers put on their military caps, all made of silk thread, one red and one green, very beautiful. When the colors faded, they were immediately replaced, so they were always very bright and eye-catching. But there was one thing that was not perfect: no matter how comfortable this dog's enjoyment was, it could not avoid being tied with a leather leash, so that its actions would never be free.

<h3>Dr. Hu's Duck</h3>
<p>— (Chen Tuigan)</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Shih, bought a duck a month ago, with a flat beak and short feet, and smooth feathers. Every morning, he released it into the courtyard and fed it grain. Dr. Hu looked at it and was happy. Unexpectedly, the duck became arrogant because of its favor. One day, it suddenly walked into Mrs. Hu's room and splattered its feces. Mrs. Hu was furious and immediately ordered the cook to tie it up and kill it. Dr. Hu could not bear it and tried to explain in every possible way, begging for mercy for the duck. Mrs. Hu refused, and the two argued without resolution. Just then, Professor Liu Shuya of Tsinghua University arrived and, learning the details, acted as a peacemaker and begged to take the duck home. To this day, this duck is still being raised in Professor Liu's residence. When asked why he alone is raising a duck, Mr. Liu immediately tells this story, and everyone who hears it cannot help but smile.</p>
<h3>After National Strength is Replenished and the Nation is Revived</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Words</p>
<h3>Talking About Dancing</h3>
<p>— Jin Eru</p>
<p>The origin of dancing is not only ancient, but also every nation has its original dance. The ancient peoples who lived in the foothills and forests had rudimentary dances, but at that time, the dances were like the joyous and celebratory movements of apes, clapping hands and stamping feet, jumping and shouting to express inner pleasure.</p>
<p>The most prominent dances are: (1) The most ancient is the Egyptian death dance, which was used at the time of death. (2) The lives of African blacks and Javanese natives can be said to be inseparable from song and dance, which they use to spend their time every day. (3) Greek dance was completely born out of art. (4) The various styles of steps in Roman dance can be found in books. Others that followed include the court theatrical dances of France and Italy and German dances. The Renaissance also produced new dances, which still bear traces of them today. Later, in the 18th century, the waltz and the national dances of the Slavic peoples emerged. In the 19th century, there were dances with beautiful names, such as the Foudé dance, the Lai You Yin round dance, the Parker dance, and the Terori dance. It was not until the 20th century that Anglo-American style dances were introduced, called step dances, followed by the Boston round dance to replace the old waltz, as well as terms such as two-step dance and one-step dance.</p>
<p>The Great Preface to the Book of Odes in China says: "(What is in the heart is called will, what is expressed in words is poetry. When emotions stir within, they are expressed on the face and in words. When words are not enough, one unknowingly moves one's hands and feet and dances with them.)" This shows that the sages of Jin already had a clear understanding of dance and did not dare to criticize it. Moreover, today there are musical rhythms and the coordination of light. Most people also believe that the creation of music originated from dance. Is culture not also derived from the origin of dance?</p>
<p>Originally, the effect of dancing on life is to reveal beautiful forms and to transform a dull life into a lively and curvy posture, enabling humans to become true, beautiful, and good animals. Furthermore, dancing is a most noble art, which not only does not degrade one's aspirations, but also adds to one's optimism and the spirit of youthful striving.</p>
<p>From sunrise to sunset, we humans are busy with work all day long, exhausting our minds and bodies. Our spirits are bound to feel tired. After finishing work, using the remaining time to seek a beneficial and healthy entertainment to restore our fatigued spirits and regulate our dull lives is also a necessary need in life.</p>
<p>In recent years, dancing in major cities in our country has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Ordinary fashionable young men and women are mostly intoxicated and crazy, indulging in dance halls. Their enthusiasm and elegance are more vigorous than any kind of work. With the national crisis at hand, is this what is called saving the country?</p>
<p>Even those gray-haired gentlemen and old ladies are appearing in the colorful electric lights. In the eyes of these more old-fashioned people, they may be criticized and ridiculed. But are these criticisms and ridicule correct? That still needs to be judged fairly by the personality of our country's youth. The improvement of material conditions, the indulgence of individualism, and the artisticization of life have become the consistent demands of mankind today. Dancing is a kind of lifestyle and artisticization, which deserves our attention.</p>
<h3>Pursuing Greatness</h3>
<p>— (Hu Shu)</p>
<p>Greatness - this mysterious and elusive noun, this empty and boundless thing, I don't know why it is so worshiped and envied by people.</p>
<p>To put it thoroughly, almost everything has its greatness. A grass, a tree, a chicken, a dog, as long as you pursue its unattainable point, they all seem sacred and inviolable, worthy of admiration and praise.</p>
<p>Therefore, great men have the greatness of great men, and peddlers have the greatness of peddlers. As long as they can exert the strengths of their individuality, that is enough. Why bother to pursue it?</p>

<p>Since the United States announced its plan to nationalize silver, no country has been more directly affected than China. Because the United States is advocating for higher silver prices, the value of the US dollar is falling daily, which has greatly affected our country's trade. Exports have become difficult, and cheap goods imports have greatly increased, stimulating our country's consumption society. As a result, exports and imports have become even more unbalanced. This year's huge trade deficit has become an obvious fact, which is the most painful and difficult situation for our national goods industry. Domestic economists have unanimously expressed their concern about the impending economic crisis, loudly appealing to the people of the country to contribute their rescue strategies. The most thorough is the opinion of Ms. Zhang Xiaomei, director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China. She said: "Many experts have discussed how to deal with the US silver policy, which is generally nothing more than levying export taxes and banning silver exports. But in fact, it is very difficult. In her view, the most effective method is for everyone to purchase and use national goods. Because the purpose of the US silver policy is to raise prices and increase trade to exploit China, if we can see through their plan and everyone automatically and freely buys national goods, how can their policy be implemented?" This view and method is very valuable, and I agree with it wholeheartedly. I deeply hope that under this economic crisis, the entire nation, whether producing, selling, or using, will consistently think about the dangerous future of the national goods industry, work hard to love national goods, improve national goods, and happily use national goods. At the same time, I want to alleviate this economic crisis, not only by promoting sales as much as possible domestically, but also by promoting sales as much as possible abroad. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and the Products Association participating in the Chicago Expo will establish sales agencies in various European and American countries, study the customs and preferences of foreigners, and their social customs, and prepare products for direct overseas trade. Because according to the report of Ye Keliang, Consul in New York, American companies have recently boycotted German goods, and most import and export companies have published statements declaring that they will not deal in German goods, and Japanese merchants are taking the opportunity to operate. However, American people have never liked Japanese goods. Because the source of German goods is gradually decreasing, our national goods merchants do not pay attention and have no way to purchase, so they have to purchase Japanese goods. Americans who love us are all lamenting this. Our national goods industry should seize this opportunity to strive for progress and replace Japanese goods. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be undertaken by one or two people alone. It is necessary for the entire nation to cooperate in production and sales to be effective, and it is proposed that various chambers of commerce and manufacturing associations jointly establish a National Goods Sales Promotion Association, starting with the United States, and establishing three exhibition halls in the United States to collect and display our country's products, in order to attract the attention of Americans." This method is very insightful. The Ministry of Industry has now ordered the International Trade Bureau to jointly discuss the matter with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association. First, Americans should know that Chinese national goods are indeed excellent and beautiful. Second, we should know what kind of national goods are easiest to sell in the American market. By learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, the benefits will be great. This move is not only of great value to foreign trade, but also gives our national goods a new path, and the panic caused by the silver problem can also be resolved, achieving multiple goals with one move. May the national goods industry rise together to plan for it.</p>
<p>Talking About National Goods</p>
<h3>From the Alarming Import of Toys to the Responsibility of Parents</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Many people believe that the advocacy of national goods should start with children, especially in the children's thinking, to lay a lifelong commitment to using national goods and absolutely not buying foreign goods, and that this view is very reasonable, and we agree with it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>However, even though that's what we say, we believe that whether this matter can achieve truly good results still requires the joint efforts of parents at home and teachers at school. Otherwise, relying solely on the efforts of one party will yield very little results. Just look at the news in this month's newspaper about the import of games and toys worth 570,000, and you can prove that what I said is not nonsense.</p>
<p>According to reports in various newspapers: "Although our country is in a time of national crisis, our people are still playing and unaware, and some even call for entertainment while saving the country. This is evidenced by the sharp increase in the import of games and toys announced by the International Trade Bureau. The import of games and toys in the first six months of this year was 292,195 gold units, equivalent to 577,962 national currency yuan, which is a significant increase compared to the import of 233,188 gold units in the first six months of last year. The import in June alone was 32,922 gold units, equivalent to 67,424 national currency yuan. This record during a serious national crisis truly makes people feel (感嘅係之)."</p>
<p>Alas! After reading this shocking number of the import value of children's games and toys, the author was speechless for a long time. Then, thinking about it, this is indeed a serious problem that we cannot ignore and consider insignificant.</p>
<p>In fact, this news reflects that the parents of ordinary children in China still cannot effectively use national goods, and they do not have the interest in using national goods or a deep understanding of the importance of promoting national goods. This is undoubtedly a serious crisis in the voice of promoting national goods!</p>
<p>We know that children are ignorant and unknowing, and all their needs are based on the will of their parents. (Fun) is certainly the nature of children, and liking to have things in their hands to play with is also the unanimous requirement of every child. However, the right to purchase toys for children is still in the hands of their parents, especially in the hands of the children's mothers. When children need toys, parents should purchase appropriate toys for them within their means to satisfy the children's desire for hope. However, when purchasing toys, the most important thing is to purchase domestic toys for your beloved little angels to play with. At the same time, after buying them back, you can explain to the children why you don't buy foreign toys? Why must you buy domestic toys? Explain these reasons layer by layer to the children, and then a concept of using domestic goods can be deeply imprinted in the children's small minds. This concept will gradually grow in the children's minds, and they will be able to receive the effect of using domestic goods for the rest of their lives. To expand on this, if all the children in the country can do this, the national goods movement in China can receive a very great effect.</p>
<p>But how easy is it to achieve this? It requires all the parents of children in China to stand up together! Your mission is very great, and your responsibility is extremely important. How should you work hard to achieve this goal!</p>
<p>(The past is gone, the future can be pursued). Past events can serve as a profound lesson for us. I hope that the parents of children across the country will wake up because of the alarming import of games and toys and achieve a consistent use of domestic toys.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of (Children's Year)</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>It is a tragedy! A painful reality is revealed. In the statistics released by the International Trade Bureau, we see the shocking import of children's toys for six months this year, amounting to over 577,000 yuan. Compared with last year, it has increased significantly! Ah! This shows that the achievement of (not forgetting entertainment while saving the nation) can be compared with the previous import of perfume and cosmetics worth over 970,000 yuan, shining together as supreme embellishments for the Women's National Goods Year.</p>
<p>Originally, this year is (Women's National Goods Year) and also (Children's Year). Naturally, we imagined that our children would be influenced by their mothers or sisters using domestic goods, instilling patriotic thoughts in their pure hearts and cultivating correct values. But what is the reality? It has already destroyed our fervent hopes and is instead reflecting the tragedy of Children's Year—also a glimpse of the achievements in (Women's National Goods Year).</p>
<p>Children are the future masters of the country. They have the mission of transforming society and revitalizing the economy. Their every move during their early education has a profound impact on the success or failure of their future careers and the quality of their will. Now that we know that even their unnecessary toy consumption is immersed in Westernization, not to mention what they eat and wear. Soon, this group of Western goods worshippers will be rapidly produced by their inferior families, exacerbating foreign economic aggression and hindering the progress of domestic goods. Can we, the general practitioners of domestic goods, sit idly by?</p>

<h3>I Hope for a National Goods Emporium in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Suzhou, the paradise, Suzhou, the poetic city, is a wealthy metropolis in the south of the Yangtze River, close to the Paris of the East—Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai winds blow quickly. In terms of clothing, food, and housing, it has always been sophisticated. This is not my exaggeration. Once you arrive at Suzhou's Nanjing Road—Guanqian Street, you can see the magnificent and comprehensive goods.</p>
<p>Suzhou has also had auction-style national goods emporiums, but they were temporary in nature. Before long, they closed and opened, opened and closed, without organization or system. Therefore, they were like a flash in the pan and could not last.</p>
<p>In Beiju, Suzhou, a national goods emporium has been built and is currently under construction. It involves extensive construction and has a large scope. Under the blazing heat, the sound of axes echoes everywhere. This is also a good sign for the future of national goods. One cannot but admire the local gentry of Suzhou for their enthusiasm and perseverance.</p>
<p>To be honest, Suzhou people's use of foreign goods and preference for imported goods is no less than in other places. I think that along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, perhaps Suzhou can be considered the runner-up after Shanghai. When you arrive in the evening, the men and women wearing foreign clothing materials on Guanqian Street and Jinzhang Road are as numerous as carps crossing the river. Isn't this a sign of the decline of national goods?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the gentry of Suzhou have realized something and have initiated the fundraising and organization of a national goods emporium. This is a bright light in the dark night, such a joyful thing!</p>
<p>I hope that after the opening of the national goods emporium in Suzhou, the people of Suzhou will have a considerable understanding of national goods. Then, the future of national goods, starting from Suzhou, may influence all parts of China. This is a joyful thing to report.</p>
<p>National Goods Sketches</p>
<h3>Confession of a Defector from Foreign Goods to National Goods</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xu Ren</p>
<p>I am now sincerely admitting to readers that in the past, I was indeed a major general in consuming foreign goods. My former view was that non-imported goods were not stylish enough and unworthy of wearing. But now, witnessing the daily decline of the national economy, my view has greatly changed. Although the daily necessities I currently use have not yet been entirely converted to national goods! But a large part has already been changed from foreign goods to domestic goods. I have also made a determination to adopt all national goods for my supplies.</p>
<p>What are the steps I took to switch to national goods? Writing out my past experiences may provide some small contribution to fellow citizens who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods. Although I made up my mind at the time, it was quite difficult to put into practice, because many years of accumulated habits cannot be eradicated overnight. So I took a gradual approach, starting with small things first.</p>
<p>Starting in May two years ago, I implemented my plan. The first step was to check my daily necessities to see how many were not national goods, and then I made a list of non-national goods. The second step was to vow to switch to two kinds of national goods every month. After switching, I used a red pen to tick off these two items on the foreign goods list. In this way, although the results did not seem significant on a monthly basis, my supplies in these two years have almost all been transformed from imported goods to national goods.</p>
<p>To give a clear example, like washing up in the morning: in the past, the washbasin, mouthwash cup, and towel were all foreign goods. The toothbrush was “Prophylactic,” the toothpaste was “Lisrenrine,” and the facial soap was “—,” but now, my washbasin and mouthwash cup are both “Lihe Brand,” and the rest are “Yixin Brand” toothbrush, Xihu towel, Samsung toothpaste, and coconut soap. This is completely national goods!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will ask me, what is the difference after using national goods? Then I have to say that in terms of material enjoyment, I can't distinguish what differences there are between national goods and foreign goods, but I saved a lot of money, because national goods are always cheaper than foreign goods. In terms of spirit, since switching to national goods, whenever I hear and see money overflowing outwards in terms of foreign goods, I don't have to lower my head in shame. At the same time, on the other hand, seeing the prosperity of national goods, I have an indescribable excitement, as if I am also a part of cultivating their prosperity. Especially at the end of each month, when I use a red pen to tick off two kinds of foreign goods on that foreign goods list, I feel an indescribable joy and pride, because it seems as if I have fulfilled some responsibility to the country, and the past month has not been in vain!</p>
<p>How do comrades standing on the same front line think about this gradual approach of mine? Would you like to try it out too?</p>
<h3>What Era Is This?</h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>The rampant sale of foreign goods is so severe, and the progress of our national goods is like a (small boat crossing the sea).</p>
<p>The wind is strong, and the waves are surging. The path ahead is full of thorns. What era is this?</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>The opposite of the decline of national goods is clearly a symbol of the outflow of money, economic aggression, and the trauma of the market being occupied. It will become the prelude to (national ruin and family destruction).</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, if you are still (living in a drunken dream), this is naturally an era of (perilous situation) and (imminent danger).</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>If we recognize that this is a matter of life and death, from today onwards, let's all, men and women, unite and work hard! This spirit of (unity is strength),</p>
<p>Promoting national goods and resisting imported goods is naturally an era of (a ray of hope) and (turning disaster into blessing).</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Land of Gentlemen</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Striving for excellence is the attitude of gentlemen; forgetting one's roots is the behavior of petty people! It is said that Lin Zhiyong, accompanied by Duo Jiugong and Tang Ao, went overseas again to do business. After sailing for many days, they arrived at the Land of Gentlemen. Lin Zhiyong went ashore to sell goods. Tang and Duo had nothing to do on the ship, so they also went ashore for a stroll. Fortunately, they had been to this Land of Gentlemen before, so they didn't need to ask for directions and went straight to the city gate. They saw a couplet painted on the city gate: the first line was (Gentlemen Value Treasure), and the second line was (Striving for Excellence). Tang Ao was secretly surprised and thought that when I came last time, the couplet on the city gate was written like this: (Embrace Peace) (Yield to Avoid Contention). How is it that it has been changed to this sentence now? There must be a reason for it. He immediately entered the city and saw that the population was concentrated, and commerce was prosperous. The people coming and going were all dressed in plain clothes and shoes, simple and extraordinary. Moreover, they were majestic and spirited, revealing an aura of brilliance, with none of the humble and sour demeanor of the past. When Duo Jiugong saw this, he also secretly admired it. After walking for a long time, their feet were sore, so they entered a teahouse to rest. The waiter poured tea for them, and after they had drunk it once, Tang Ao saw an old man sitting next to him, with white hair and eyebrows, and a kind attitude, so he started chatting with him and inquired about what he had just seen. The old man stroked his silver beard and smiled: (That's right, in the past, we were indeed bookish and didn't like to fight with others. But in this world where the weak are prey to the strong, if you want peace, others won't give you peace; if you want to yield, others will invade step by step. Our Land of Gentlemen is famous for its gentleness. A neighboring ambitious country comes to bully us every day, taking away one of our cities today and invading one of our fortresses tomorrow. Our people became anxious and all roused their spirits, striving to defend against the enemy, only then did they lower the ambitions of the ambitious country. The king was afraid that the people would forget about it after the matter was over, so he painted this couplet to warn people's hearts.) As the old man spoke, Lin Zhiyong, with a sad face, also walked towards the teahouse seat. Tang Ao greeted him to sit down and hurriedly asked: (Brother-in-law! Did the business go well?) Lin Zhiyong drank tea while shaking his head and said: (It's really a ghost! Usually, no matter which country I go to, I can always make some profit; moreover, in the past few times I came overseas, the Land of Gentlemen was an easy place to sell goods. Who knew that today when I came here, I asked everyone, and they shook their heads, and asked everywhere, and they didn't want it. Looking at this situation, I'm afraid that even if I gave it to them, they would refuse to accept it! Don't you think it's strange?) As Lin Zhiyong spoke, the old man next to him interjected: (Official! You must not have been here for many years, so you don't know the recent customs. After we were bullied by the ambitious country, not only did the people of the whole country reorganize their military preparations; even the goods from outside, we vowed not to buy a single item. Because if you buy one item of foreign goods, the country will have one less coin of wealth. When two countries are at war, money is the backing of military force. If the country does not have sufficient financial resources, how can it last with the enemy! Moreover, your country also has an idiom called (A gentleman does not forget his roots).) May I ask, what is the explanation? Lin Zhiyong, with a quick mouth, rushed to say: (That is a very convenient sentence, which means that a gentleman does not forget his roots.) The old man nodded and said: (That's right! But we have another explanation: it means that a gentleman does not forget the various things of his country, loves the land of his country, loves the people of his country, and loves the goods of his country. That is the true annotation of this sentence. I don't know what the officials think?) Tang and Duo nodded repeatedly in agreement. At this time, Lin Zhiyong said angrily: (What are you talking about roots and not roots, causing us not to be able to do business, it's really unlucky.) After saying that, he dragged Tang and Duo out of the tea [house], went to the ship, raised the sail, and left the borders of that Land of Gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mr. Reporter:</p>
<p>Your publication promotes national goods and is always admirable. Recently, I heard that the Jiangnan Shipyard is building the Pinghai warship, and all the materials are planned to be ordered from Japan one after another, totaling no less than several million yuan. Although I know that shipbuilding materials, national goods are still mostly lacking, leakage not flowing east, also flows west, however, at this time when Sino-Japanese relations are so bad, using this huge sum of money to buy inferior goods is no different from helping the enemy with bullets, I am extremely distressed. I hope that all patriotic gentlemen will find a way to sanction it, and the country will be fortunate.</p>

<p>National Goods Introduction</p>
<h3>New Materials for School Workshop Courses</h3>
<p>— Invented by Zili Handicraft Cooperative —</p>
<p>In our country's primary and secondary schools, many workshop courses involve gypsum clay handicrafts. However, the most difficult gypsum work is mold turning for three-dimensional images. Because gypsum or agar-agar is usually used as a negative mold, it is either too hard or too brittle and does not last long, so students do not easily get good results. The Zili Handicraft Cooperative at No. 1 Sidali, Gaota Road, this city, recently invented a special elastic rubber for making negative molds, which can eliminate the above-mentioned shortcomings, and can make the whole mold without having to be divided and assembled, making gypsum statue or artificial marble statue work easy and the results are very good. Now, many schools in this and other cities order this rubber model from the cooperative for students to use. Because the cooperative has many other products and cannot make molds for people piecemeal, it publishes the manufacturing method. All school workshop course teachers and students who have appropriate introductions can come to the cooperative to practice the manufacturing method free of charge. The cooperative also has a new elastic clay, which can be used instead of ordinary clay. Students use this to knead objects, and then heat them in a simple way to make elastic rubber products that will not break when thrown. This is also one of the novel workshop materials. In addition, there are many new workshop materials, such as artificial marble, bronze statues, artificial ivory, light balloons, electroplating, and rubber stamps, all of which can be operated freely by elementary school students using the simplest methods. The founder of the cooperative, Mr. Lin Lubin, originally came from teacher training and industry, and once served as a translator at the Commercial Press. He has also written and translated many books on school workshop courses.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Goods Burden</h3>
<p>— Yiyiguan Master</p>
<p>(Foreign Goods Burden) is a respectful title that we Huzhou people give to brothers who are covered in foreign goods from head to toe.</p>
<p>We know that (Foreign Goods Burden) is a burden carried on the shoulders, with a cluster drum shaken in the hand, walking through the streets and alleys, selling (Foreign Goods). We Huzhou people use it as a respectful title for brothers who are covered in foreign goods, which is no different from calling this group of (Foreign Fans) (Foreign Goods Salesmen), which is truly precise and wonderfully appropriate.</p>
<p>But, it is also regrettable to say that all (Foreign Fans) have faces as thick as cowhide. No matter if you respectfully call them (Foreign Goods Burden) or (Foreign Goods Salesmen), they not only do not resent it, but also take pride in it! Their expressions are such that you can laugh and scold as you please, I will still be a (Foreign Goods Burden). Alas! Zhuangzi said: The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart. I think everyone's heart is dead like this, so what is strange that (Promoting National Goods) has been practiced for decades without any success, only causing foreign goods to increase year after year?</p>
<p>Alas! (Foreign Goods Burden)! (Foreign Goods Burden)! You are truly the culprit of destroying national goods! I hope you will wake up quickly, resolutely and earnestly, wash your heart and renew your face to promote national goods and resist foreign goods. Otherwise, if you always act as a (Foreign Goods Burden), then, inevitably, the country will perish, and you will eventually become a (slave of a conquered nation)!</p>

<h3>Methods of Contentment in Poverty</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Children need to be taught by others, and illnesses need to be treated by others, even if one is a teacher or a doctor oneself. But the methods of conducting oneself in life are probably something that one must consider for oneself. Many good prescriptions prescribed by others are often just waste paper.</p>
<p>Advising people to be content in poverty is the great principle of governing the country and pacifying the world, both in ancient and modern times. Many prescriptions have been written, but none have had a perfect restorative effect. Therefore, new prescriptions are endless. Recently, I saw two kinds, but I think they are probably not very appropriate.</p>
<p>One is to teach people to be interested in their occupation. Once they are interested, they will be tireless in whatever they do. Of course, it is reasonable to say so, but it must be a relatively easy occupation. Not to mention coal mining and manure hauling, even workers in Shanghai factories who work at least ten hours a day are bound to be exhausted by the evening, and injuries are mostly caused at that time. (A sound mind dwells in a sound body.) They can't even take care of their own bodies, how can they still be interested? — Unless they love interest more than life. If you ask them themselves, I think they will definitely say to reduce working hours and never dream of the interest generation method.</p>
<p>Another is extremely thorough: in hot weather, the wealthy are still busy with socializing, sweating profusely, while the poor carry a torn mat, spread it on the road, take off their clothes, and enjoy the cool breeze, their joy is endless, which is called (sweeping the world). This is also a rare and poetic prescription, but there is also a spoilsport behind it. As autumn is approaching, if you go to the road early in the morning, you will see those former living immortals of (sweeping the world) holding their bellies and vomiting yellow water. Approximately, there are indeed not many fools in the world who have blessings before their eyes but refuse to enjoy them. If poverty is really so interesting, the wealthy would definitely lie on the road first, and the mats of the poor would have no place to spread out.</p>
<p>The excellent results of the Shanghai Middle School Entrance Examination have been announced, including (A Discussion on Taking Cold Food and Filling the Belly), in which there is a passage——</p>
<p>(……If virtue and career have been established, then even if meals are not sustained and clothing is torn, its fame and virtue are enough to be passed down to future generations, and spiritual life will be fully developed, so why worry about the insufficiency of material life? The true meaning of life lies in that, not in this.……) (Transcribed from the third issue of (New Sayings of the Forest))</p>
<p>This is a step further than the topic, saying that even not being able to (fill the belly) doesn't matter. But the good prescription prescribed by middle school students is not applicable to college students, and at the same time, a large group of people demanding occupations still appears.</p>
<p>The truth is an emotionless thing that can shatter empty words. Since it is so clearly revealed, in fact, in my humble opinion, there is no need to play (ziyue, zheye) anymore——anyway, it is always useless.</p>
<h3>Outlet</h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>There are many roads in the world, east, west, north, and south, long, short, wide, and narrow. Among them, there is one that seems to be specially reserved for young people to explore, called an outlet.</p>
<p>That an outlet must be explored shows that it is not easy to find one. However, some people blame it on the explorers, saying that they are weak in talent and have high aspirations. This problem worries scholars, so they carry medicine bags, intending to help the world, and there are two kinds of effective medicines for special treatment: one is self-awareness, and the other is introspection.</p>
<p>Introspection and self-awareness are like Coptis chinensis and Picrorhiza scrophulariiflora. Although they are produced in different places and have different names, their properties are similar. Self-awareness must be based on introspection, and introspection should also be based on self-awareness. In the final analysis, if there is no way out, one can only blame oneself.</p>
<p>However, the result of blaming oneself is that one still cannot find a way out. Weak talent and high aspirations are common problems. Even scholars who are rich in worldly wisdom cannot avoid them, and of course there are young people, but not many. Young people have no status, no reputation. They shout until their throats are hoarse and run until their feet are worn out, yet they are not worth five thousand yuan. Therefore, they have no choice but to advertise themselves and offer to work (regardless of salary). Although their abilities are very weak, they should not be worthless, but they end up being worthless. Facts have long taught them that they cannot afford to have high aspirations.</p>
<p>It can be seen that as long as there is a road, they are willing to walk it. As for whether they will find an outlet, young people dare not even consider it.</p>
<p>In ancient China, there was a man named Ruan Ji, who was naturally fond of traveling. When he was happy, he often did not return home all day, unless he encountered a road that was impassable, and then he had to cry and return home. However, he was a high-ranking official.</p>
<p>If a young person who is not a high-ranking official encounters a dead end, it is because of weak talent; if he still wants to cry, then he is suspected of having high aspirations.</p>
<p>Young people are so hard to make a name for themselves.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Issue of Europeanization from a Linguistic Perspective (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— He Fengyuan</p>
<p>Squeezed in the debate over classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and popular language, there is also the issue of whether to Europeanize or not, adding to the commotion. One worthy brother said that Europeanization is something that traitors do, and another worthy brother said that (Chinese grammar must be infused with some Europeanization). This is really as much a waste of words as the debate over classical Chinese, vernacular Chinese, and popular language. Little do they know that written language has its own inevitable path of evolution under the influence of various social relationships. It will definitely not follow whoever shouts the loudest or beats the drums the hardest. If you say that Europeanization is (treason), sometimes it has no choice but to (be treacherous); if you say that grammar must be infused with some Europeanization, it will not necessarily follow your advice and add some Europeanization. Where it does not need Europeanization, it is not because it is afraid of being (a traitor), but because it has its own inevitable reasons for not needing Europeanization. Where it needs Europeanization, it also has its own (difficulties). The futility of such a debate can be understood by simply drawing a lesson from the very similar debate over the foreignization of English in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. At that time, English, which had just risen from the London dialect to become the national language, also faced such a dispute as we are now. Some people—Nashe, Elyot, Pettie, etc.—admired the beauty of Latin rhetoric and grammar, and said that English should be improved by imitating Latin and borrowing foreign words. Others, the (nativist faction)—Asham, Wilson, etc.—pointed to Nashe and others as (English traitors), saying that there should not be any foreign elements or even half a foreign word in English. This dispute continued for one or two hundred years. Later, the nativist faction even advocated establishing a national academy to prevent the intrusion of foreign language influences. Johnson even wrote his famous dictionary to preserve nativist English. But who did English follow? It did not follow anyone. It accepted some foreign language influences and borrowed many foreign words (about three-quarters of the current English vocabulary is foreign words). Nativism was not completely preserved, and the doctor's dictionary is now just a classic on the bookshelf. But it also did not become as foreignized as Nashe and others had suggested. English is still English.</p>
<p>What is cited here is not an isolated example, but a fact that demonstrates the principle of language evolution. That is, language is bound to accept external or internal influences. It will not follow the subjective opinions of any individual. Unless the British do not communicate with foreign cultures, there will inevitably be foreign elements in English. Unless their racial habits and all kinds of heritage are completely eliminated after the British communicate with foreign cultures, English will not be completely foreignized. There are really many examples that can be used for reference in this way. For example, American (English) has also had similar disputes. Pickering, Worcestcr, and GrantWhite insisted that American (English) should follow British English as the standard, but Webster, who was famous for his large dictionary, advocated that American (English) has its own American standard. But American (English) does not follow anyone either. It has its British aspects and its American aspects.</p>
<h3>Marr and His Linguistic Theory</h3>
<p>— Yixian</p>
<p>Recently, many people have gradually felt that the so-called vernacular needs to be reformed. And the banner of the popular language movement has also been raised. However, to determine the trend of this major and complex reform movement, it is not enough to rely solely on intuitive insights. We also need to base it on the most advanced new theories in linguistics. Taking advantage of everyone's enthusiastic discussion of the popular language issue, I will briefly introduce this new theory, namely the founder of the Japhetic theory, the Soviet linguist Marr.</p>
<p>Marr is the president of the Soviet Union's State Academy of Material Culture and a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. He is seventy years old this year. He has a history of forty-five years of scientific research on oriental languages.</p>
<p>He was born in Transcaucasia. His father, a famous horticulturist, was Scottish, and his mother was Georgian. Although his father's early death made the family difficult, his mother did her best to cultivate him to study. In 1883, he entered St. Petersburg University. He studied oriental languages there. (Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, etc.)</p>
<p>He has an exceptional record in the subject he has chosen. After graduation, he continued to do research on Armenian.</p>
<p>From the beginning of his research on oriental languages, Marr expressed his opposition to the then popular view of obliterating the languages of colonial and semi-colonial nations and blindly praising Indo-European languages.</p>
<p>In the pre-revolutionary period, Marr's protests against this imperialist propaganda were hidden in scientific terminology and style. Most of his writings were considered obscure by the scientific community at the time. Everyone regarded him as an eccentric scholar who created heresies.</p>
<p>Marr's linguistic theory has a revolutionary spirit and tendency, which was not fully understood by many people at that time. He calls this theory the Japhetic theory. The important points are as follows. The structure of language is in constant motion, and what determines this motion is the maker of the language, that is, the movement of human society. Therefore, the structure of language can be regarded as evidence of the various eras of history that mankind has gone through. Marr regards language as something determined by society, and therefore focuses on the characteristics of human labor, that is, consciousness. The farther people move away from animals, the more significant their influence on (nature) becomes, pointing to the nature of willful and planned action with a predetermined purpose. This planned labor is a distinctive feature of mankind.</p>
<p>In the gradual historical evolution, the development of various types of thought is particularly emphasized in Marr's research on language phenomena.</p>
<p>It was Engels who first explained the development of language from the process of labor. He once said: The more complex the economic activities, the more concrete the thoughts become. Articulation is the result of prolonged and continuous social influence on the vocal organs.</p>
<p>Marr followed the same path and continued his research. Finally, as the famous Soviet scholar Meshchaninov said, he completed a brilliant transformation in linguistics. This includes a completely changed classification of languages, which is based on the principles suggested by the history of human society. As for the old method of tracing various languages back to the original language family, it goes without saying that it has been completely abandoned.</p>
<p>The October Revolution enabled Marr to freely express his previously somewhat disguised meaning. He continued to develop his theory in writing and in practical work with political significance.</p>
<p>Because of his thorough understanding of the oriental minorities of the Soviet Union, he played an important role in the work of Latinizing the alphabets of those ethnic groups. Among the peoples of the East, his reputation is great. This is the result of his work, which established their rights to their own culture and helped to develop that culture.</p>
<p>Marr publishes various papers and works every year in succession, publishing the results of his tireless scientific research. His theory of the origin and history of human language has gradually become more and more popular.</p>
<p>Although Marr has reached such an advanced age, he continues to work as the leader of several scientific groups, as a writer and explorer. His latest paper, which has not yet been finalized, explores the interrelationships between Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian.</p>

<p>As he thought, he poured the wine into the cup and brought it to his mouth, and only one sip reduced the capacity of the cup by more than half. Suddenly he remembered, could it be that his Sasha was no longer in this world?</p>
<p>Thinking like this, he remembered that Sasha had not sent a letter in the two years since he left, nor had he heard any news about Sasha from other people's mouths; and in the previous year, maybe five days earlier, he had a dream in which he saw Sasha standing in front of him, thin as a rail.</p>
<p>He shuddered. Everything seemed to suggest that his Sasha must have died. He hated himself for cursing him when he left. Maybe it was his curse that killed Sasha.</p>
<p>(——This is impossible, this is impossible.)</p>
<p>He said silently in his heart. He thought of Renliang's God, who should not take away his grandson, his only grandson.</p>
<p>He recalled that five years after his marriage, that unrighteous wife did not know where she had escaped to, leaving him with a three-year-old son. Although he still had the ability to make another woman his wife at that time, he did not do so because he was afraid of all the disputes caused by women. Under his care, his son grew to the age when he should move from his father's lap to a woman's embrace. But later, his son died quickly in military service after his marriage.</p>

<p>Telegraph Special Issue</p>
<p>Voices from the Telegraph Industry</p>
<h3>Distinction Between Public and Private</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>International telegraph regulations list government telegrams as first class, official telegrams as second class, and urgent commercial telegrams and ordinary private telegrams as next in order. This is not a special promotion for first and second class telegrams. Rather, it is because they value the fact that they are sent for public affairs, so telegrams sent for public affairs should be delivered first, not for private matters.</p>
<p>Whether it is government or military telegrams, what is transmitted should be limited to political or military affairs, otherwise it will not be consistent with the name and nature of government and military telegrams. Official telegrams (that is, various official telegrams related to the telegram itself) should also only talk about official affairs and not involve other matters. This is as it should be and should not be messed up. However, since the accumulation of abuses has been passed down, telegrams are sent indiscriminately. Often, private messages are sent as official telegrams. In a shift, they can turn the private into the public, or use the public to benefit the private. This is of course beneficial for those who send telegrams, but the loss to the telegraph office cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>Government and military telegrams receive preferential treatment in sending, and official telegrams are transmitted free of charge. If the distinction between public and private is not clear, and they all receive the same preferential treatment and are free of charge, how much material does the transmission of telegrams cost? How much are the maintenance costs? As a result, there will be no compensation. If this happens in one place, it will happen throughout the country. Is the loss limited? The income and expenditure of the telecommunications administration offset each other, and there is no shortage of deficits every year. Although the reasons are not singular, the abuse of telegrams is also a matter of deep concern to those who care about the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>To remedy this, one should strictly distinguish between public and private in terms of telegrams. According to the current method, each office has regulations for detaining and punishing official telegrams that involve private matters. This is for internal purposes. If a government or military telegram is transmitted, if the text is not limited to political or military affairs, then the sender will still be charged for the private telegram. This kind of crackdown is not new. All countries do it. Those who understand this should express deep sympathy.</p>
<p>Some people also say that if the distinction between public and private is strict, the abuse of telegrams can be avoided. Those who send government and military telegrams and official telegrams will be cautious and considerate. It will be seen that the nature of the telegrams that are sent and transmitted are truly in line with the regulations. The circuit will be cleared, and the telegraph will be faster. Is it only related to the revenue aspect of the telecommunications administration that it will benefit from it?</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>The Issue of Public Telephones</h3>
<p>— Ji Ran</p>
<p>I read in the previous issue of this journal that someone raised the issue of public telephones for discussion, which is quite interesting. Public telephones are indeed rarely seen in various parts of our country. Considering the convenience of those who do not have a telephone but want to use one, instead of feeling difficulty in borrowing a telephone, it is more beneficial to have a public telephone nearby. I am not talented, but I dare to add some words within my limited knowledge so that the gentlemen who care about the telecommunications industry can correct me.</p>
<p>I personally believe that there are many reasons why public telephones have not been promoted in various parts of our country. The most important ones are the following two points:</p>
<p>(A) Usage Problem - Telephone services in various places have indeed made progress in recent years, but they still cannot be said to be fully developed. In large commercial ports, most residents who use the telephone frequently do not hesitate to pay a monthly fee, so most have a telephone at home. Those who want to borrow a telephone temporarily are only a few, and they are scattered in various places. Now, if ten public telephones are installed in a certain city, assuming that the cost of each local call is five cents, if these ten telephones are installed in users' homes, the monthly income of the telephone bureau will be sixty yuan, while the income from public telephones will only be thirty or forty yuan, or even less than this number. Therefore, with the same telephone being occupied, the telephone bureau cannot avoid suffering losses due to the opening of public telephones. In this regard, if there are not many people using public telephones in the city and the telephone fees are not much, the bureau's expenses for materials, machines, and maintenance will inevitably be uncompensated. This is in terms of business.</p>
<p>(B) Installation Problem - For the sake of convenience for citizens, the location of public telephones is of utmost importance. If there is no precise distribution beforehand, it will be seen that there are several places where more people use public telephones, while in other places, there are very few users. This kind of situation is certainly not ideal. Taking our country's major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan as examples, the area is extremely wide and the layout is extremely difficult. If they are installed as much as possible, there are currently no sufficient telephones and materials. If only a few are installed, then the convenience to the public will be minimal. Moreover, public telephones are as rare as morning stars. Citizens who want to make a call would rather ask for a nearby loan than travel far to make a public telephone call.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief discussion of what I have in mind, and it may not be accurate. However, since this journal has raised this issue for discussion, the promotion and implementation of public telephones should seek to facilitate citizens everywhere. At the same time, the business of the bureau should also be considered. To seek a solution, these two points should be paid attention to first.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Miscellany</p>
<h3>Telephone - Automatic</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>▲User Turns Dial in Sequence ▲Mechanical Step-by-Step Action</p>
<p>Automatic telephones, in terms of lines and telephone styles and their usage, are well known to users. This journal has also discussed them in previous issues, so there is no need to discuss them further. However, to understand the automatic nature of telephones, one must see the machinery inside the telephone office. When users use the telephone and rotate the number on the dial, all that exists is the ability of the dial to return to its original position by itself. Nothing else is automatic. Therefore, the real mechanical automation is not in the lines, not in the user's telephone, but in the machines inside the office.</p>
<p>The machines inside the office can be roughly divided into two parts. One part is used to supply the current for communication (including ringing, talking, etc.), which belongs to the power supply. The other part listens to the user and carries out the connection, which is the automatic machine.</p>
<p>If we visit an automatic telephone office, we will see that the machines installed on each rack are arranged in order. The sound of "tick-tock" is heard in the east, and the sound of "chick-chick" is heard in the west. All of these are accepting the commands issued by the user's finger and proceeding step by step. Once the medium is formed, the voice reaches the destination. The machine is doing the automatic wiring work.</p>
<p>Those who are dazzled by the dazzling colors and do not understand the situation will probably not be able to avoid it. Now, let's first briefly explain the simplified diagram of the automatic wiring in the office. By thinking about this, more than half of the problem will be solved.</p>
<p>The telephone connects to the user's telephone through a line switch. There is a trunk line to connect to the first selector. From the first selector to the second selector, it connects to the connector. There are also trunk lines in the middle to connect. The number of each trunk line is determined according to the needs of the business, that is, the number of users calling. Now, let's try to give an example to explain the general process of mechanical automatic connection.</p>
<p>Suppose that the capacity of the automatic telephone exchange is only suitable for users with less than 1,000 numbers. Then its equipment is a line switch, a first selector (without a second selector), and a connector. If the capacity of the exchange can be increased from 10,000 to 100,000 numbers, then there are first, second, and even third selectors between the line switch and the connector. In short, the larger the capacity of the exchange, the more numbers there are, and the more selectors there are.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume that this automatic exchange can accommodate 10,000 numbers. Then the connection that the user goes through when using it is first from the telephone to the line switch, through the first and second selectors, and then from the connector to the telephone of the called user. If the number dialed is 1234, then the automatic connection proceeds as briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) When the user picks up the headset to prepare to dial, the line switch on that line activates and automatically connects the line to the first selector that is idle, and emits a buzzing sound, which is called (達而通).</p>
<p>(2) When the user rotates the first number (1), the pulse current is transmitted to the first selector, which automatically selects a group of empty relay lines and connects to the second selector. The range that this second selector can connect to is from 1000 to 1999, and at the same time, (達而通) is disconnected from the line and can no longer be heard.</p>
<p>(3) When the user rotates the second number (2) at the time of two, the second selector is activated. After the selection described above, it passes through the empty trunk line and connects to the connector. The range that this connector can connect to is from 1200 to 1299.</p>
<p>(4) When the user dials the last two numbers (3) and (4), these two pulse currents pass through the connector, making the 34th number selected and connected in the middle of 1200 to 1299 (that is, hundreds of users). Therefore, the called user 1234 is formally connected, and the ringing current is passed through the called telephone, and the bell rings loudly.</p>
<h3>Historical View of the Joint Establishment of Post and Telecommunications</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In recent years, the transportation authorities have worked hard to govern and have made remarkable new achievements in various aspects of transportation administration and business. Its greatest goals are to facilitate the public, save expenses, and increase efficiency. The joint establishment of post and telecommunications is to implement these three major goals. Both post and telecommunications use communication as their business, and both are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications to handle business. Although the specialized technologies are different, the purpose of serving the people is the same. Now, the Ministry of Communications has resolutely promulgated the measures for the joint establishment of post and telecommunications. Starting from March 1, it will be piloted in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei, and then implemented uniformly throughout the country starting from July 1. From then on, throughout the country, places that can send mail can receive reports, and places that can send reports can send mail. The merger of post and telecommunications has initially been successful, which can be greatly recorded in the history of transportation in our country.</p>
<p>However, the proposal for the joint establishment of post and telecommunications did not originate in our country, and the difficulties are fewer in our country than in other countries. This is because the postal services of other countries have a long history of more than one hundred years, while the telegraph has only been around for sixty or seventy years, and the telephone has only been around for thirty or forty years. Facilities and operations all require specialized technologies, so they were initially operated independently. Moreover, the establishment of post and telecommunications was mostly private, and the companies were not yet sound. After being managed by the state, they all had to be strictly reorganized, so the degree of development of both parties was different. With these two reasons, it is not easy to merge post and telecommunications in a short period of time. The process of handling in the UK and Japan is described below:</p>
<p>(1) United Kingdom: The General Post Office of England was established in the seventeenth century (the first appointment of the Postmaster General in 1689). The telegraph was founded by commercial companies in 1846, and was not operated by the government until 1870. The telephone business was also founded by commercial companies in 1880. The government started operating long-distance telephones in 1892, and local telephones in 1899. It was not until 1913 that the government took over the management of all commercial telephones in the country. The post, telegraph, and telephone, each with its own special evolution, were all initially separated, and later gradually merged after being returned to the government.</p>
<p>(2) Japan: The postal and telecommunications business in Japan was not state-owned from the beginning. The postal service belonged to the Ministry of the Interior in the fourth year of Meiji (1871), and the telegraph belonged to the Ministry of Public Works in the second year of Meiji (1869), each governing its own affairs. In the eighteenth year of Meiji (1885), they were all placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the proposal to merge local post and telecommunications arose. There were proponents and opponents, each holding their own views. After another eight years, the merger of post and telecommunications was implemented, and the articles of association were revised, calling it first, second, and third class postal and telegraph offices. Although the telephone business was also founded by the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, local telephone offices were completely separated from postal and telegraph offices. It was not until the thirty-sixth year of Meiji (1903) that they were merged with postal and telecommunications offices in the official system. The telephone exchange room could not be merged quickly, so it had to wait until the bureau building was rebuilt or the machinery was changed.</p>
<p>Looking at the process of merging post and telecommunications in the UK and Japan, the process began with the people creating it, then the government buying it, and finally merging it. This took a considerable amount of time and did not know how much effort it took. In our country, the telecommunications administration has been operated by the state since the fifth year of Guangxu (1879). Although it went through two periods of official supervision and commercial operation and commercial loans and official operation, it was still returned to state operation in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu (1908). The postal service in our country has also been operated by the state since the beginning. In the twenty-third year of Guangxu (1896), it was managed by Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, and was subordinate to the Prime Minister's Office, and was later transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was not until the third year of Xuantong (1911) that the postal service and customs were separated, and they were placed under the same Ministry of Communications as the telecommunications administration until today. The two departments of post and telecommunications have been under the same responsible ministry and the same jurisdiction for more than 30 years. There is a unified sovereignty, balanced development, and no closed-door policy or divisions. Therefore, when it comes to the joint establishment of post and telecommunications, the first step is to merge the houses for office work, and the economic command system remains the same. It is only necessary to formulate measures and then implement them across the board. In recent months, the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have achieved the most significant results. The remaining provinces are also promoting it in order. The Ministry of Communications also specially dispatched more than ten inspectors on June 23 to go to various provinces to inspect the joint establishment of post and telecommunications. In the future, there will be more progress to see.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Postal Savings Bureau's Collection and Payment of Funds on Behalf of Electrical Administration Agencies</h3>
<p>— Nanchuang</p>
<p>In order to promote the joint establishment of postal and telecommunications services, the Electrical Administration Bureau and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau entered into a contract whereby the latter would handle the collection and payment of funds for telegraph and telephone bureaus, as well as several radio stations, in major commercial ports and important locations throughout the country. This was a very ordinary matter, but unexpectedly, it was met with opposition from the postal workers' unions, resulting in a slight misunderstanding. In fact, the Electrical Administration Bureau is not only taking advantage of this period of joint postal and telecommunications establishment to demonstrate financial transparency in a timely manner, but also has a solid guarantee of the original content of the Ministry of Transportation's agreement. There is no need to worry about any unforeseen circumstances. Rumors that the post office must subsidize a certain amount each month are completely unfounded. It is reported that the accounts for all receipts and payments for the first month of the trial run—July of this year—have been settled clearly. The income and expenses offset each other, leaving a surplus of more than 100,000 yuan, which shows that the operation is going smoothly, and both postal and telecommunications services are benefiting from it.</p>
<h3>Several Special Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Lao Tan</p>
<p>People only know that telegrams are telegrams, but telegrams are divided into several categories, some of which are quite special. Here are a few examples for conversation starters:</p>
<p>New Year's Telegrams are frequently received at various bureaus and stations during Christmas or the New Year. This is a type of telegram used for reciprocal greetings, but when people are separated by vast oceans or live far apart, receiving such a telegram naturally enhances their emotions and evokes feelings of longing.</p>
<p>Weather Bureau Reports are reports of weather conditions, especially before temperature changes or hurricane strikes. These weather reports are very important to people's lives. The telegrams are usually simple and clear, and they are transmitted free of charge by the telegraph bureau.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the term "Deferred Telegrams," one might misunderstand, saying that telegrams are not necessarily fast; however, the "delay" is what the sender wants. The sender is willing to pay a lower fee, allowing the telegram to be sent out when the telegraph service is less busy. The meaning of "deferred" simply indicates that it can be sent after other types of telegrams, but in reality, it is not too slow, much faster than airmail.</p>
<p>Typesetting requires proofreading, accounting requires proofreading, and telegrams seem to be transmitted on wires, copied one by one, without the need for proofreading. However, for some telegrams, the senders worry that even a slight error could have a significant impact, so for peace of mind, they request the bureau to proofread them. The bureau, of course, complies, but adds a proofreading fee (this is on-machine proofreading, where the sent telegram is re-sent once). Proofreading does not necessarily refer to the entire telegram; it may only involve proofreading a few words or numbers in the telegram, entirely according to the sender's wishes.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Converting Morse Machines to Direct-Line Type</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The telegraph machines used in Europe and the United States have evolved rapidly, from Morse machines to Wheatstone machines to Creed machines to printing machines, from single-duplex to duplex to multiplex, constantly innovating and striving for perfection. Here, those who continue to use Morse machines for communication mostly adopt the direct-line wiring method, which is beneficial in terms of technology and economy. Looking back at our country's telegraph bureaus, eight or nine out of ten still use Morse machines, and the return lines of these machines are mostly shared by several machines working in rotation. The wiring method, except for a few return lines using the direct-line type, mostly uses the parallel type, which not only wastes electrical energy but also reduces efficiency. In order to improve the telegraph service, the Ministry of Transportation has specially formulated a "Direct-Line Morse Machine Wiring Method and Work Instructions," and on May 18th of this year, it ordered all bureaus nationwide to convert the parallel circuits of Morse machines to direct-line operation within one month, except for return lines used for both telegraph and telephone, which could be converted later. The advantages can be seen as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Convenient operation: The current received by the relay in a parallel return line, even if the line itself has no leakage, varies in magnitude depending on the distance from the transmitting bureau. This variation in received current is especially pronounced in bureaus where more than one station is working on the same line. If you want to work with other bureaus on the same line, you must adjust the relay in time to suit the received current. The operation is inconvenient, and obstacles are prone to occur. If the direct-line type is installed, the current at each station, whether upper, lower, or middle, is uniform, and the current received by the relay, if there is no leakage on the line, can be fixed. Therefore, after adjusting the relay, it can work with any bureau without temporary adjustment.</p>
<p>(2) Energy saving: According to actual calculations, considering the total power of the relevant bureaus in Jiangsu Province and neighboring areas, if all return lines are converted to direct-line type, the power saved would be 95.10 watts. Assuming that the average power generation time for the relevant bureaus is 2 hours per day, the monthly power saved would be 5706 watt-hours. Assuming that the capacity of each wet battery is 10 watt-hours, the monthly savings would be 571 wet batteries. If we calculate the number of batteries for all telegraph bureaus in the country, the number would be considerable.</p>
<h3>How the Public Can Promote the Development of International Wireless Telegraphy</h3>
<p>— Ding Haitao</p>
<p>The international wireless telegraph station is the only large-scale enterprise operated by our country, and its relationship to our country and nation is extremely important. In other words, if a country has no foreign publicity agency, it cannot demonstrate its spirit of independence; if a nation lacks autonomous international communication, it cannot promote its glory. Therefore, the mission of our international wireless telegraph station is not limited to recovering rights and interests. Since the aforementioned significance has been clarified, how should our people promote the development of this undertaking in order to fulfill their national duty? The development of our international telecommunications industry relies on collective wisdom and effort. The following methods are proposed, and our people should quickly implement them!</p>
<p>(1) International trade run by Chinese should universally adopt international wireless telegrams—International trade run by Chinese, in other words, international commerce operated with Chinese capital and complete autonomy, should be widely publicized. Relevant businesses should unite and universally adopt international wireless telegrams "Via CGRA." At the same time, when communicating with foreign countries, they should actively promote and encourage the other party to adopt them. If they refuse to switch to wireless telegraph transmission, the business should state: "We cannot be responsible for any delays in telegrams transmitted through other routes that affect business." And a detailed copy of the address of each foreign communication should be submitted to the local bureau's (business inspector) for compilation and direct solicitation in order to achieve complete success. Our autonomous foreign trade, regardless of whether it is export or import, can decide the route of telegrams to be sent without being constrained by foreign merchants.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese compradors in foreign firms should assist the bureau's business inspectors in soliciting international wireless telegrams—Since its opening, our international wireless telegraph has won the trust of foreign merchants due to its complete equipment and conscientious management. Therefore, the speed of progress of this business has truly exceeded our expectations. Although this is due to the improvement of the undertaking itself, the assistance of Chinese compradors in foreign firms has also been significant. However, if some foreign merchants are ignorant of the spirit of our international telegraph station and refuse to send telegrams through the new circuit, the Chinese comprador should directly explain to the foreign staff nearby. If there are still misunderstandings, they can also notify the business inspector of the local bureau to work together to clarify the situation, so that our international wireless telegraph enterprise can be promoted smoothly.</p>
<p>In summary, the future development of today's state-owned enterprises is just beginning. All our people should understand their own position and unite to promote them. The day when state-owned enterprises develop will also be the time when our country and nation are revived. All our people, please think carefully!</p>
<p>(3) Increase direct bureaus and reduce retransmissions: As a result of using the parallel type, the number of connected bureaus on one circuit is limited to three or four or more, otherwise the communication time must be limited, so retransmissions are also common. Once a telegram is retransmitted, delays and mis-transmissions of codes are unavoidable. If the direct-line type is adopted, one circuit can connect five to ten bureaus or more. Germany, the United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries have even more than ten to fourteen connections, communicating directly with each other without obstacles, so there is no need for retransmission procedures. Not only can manpower and materials be saved, but the speed and accuracy of telegraph service are greatly increased.</p>
<p>(4) Abolish relay stations: It is found that in foreign circuits below 400 miles, most Morse machines do not use relay stations. Because the bureaus connected on the circuit are all direct-line type, there is no need to set up relay stations. These relay stations are difficult to manage and offer little economic benefit. Moreover, when manufacturing telegraph machines, the price is higher because they must be suitable for relay station applications. The resistance of the relay is set at 2,000 ohms, requiring more power, and the establishment and maintenance costs are high, which is not economical.</p>
<p>The above are the advantages of the direct-line type, which are also the shortcomings of the parallel type. Currently, all telegraph bureaus under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation are gradually being converted to the direct-line type, and they have reported that communication is exceptionally smooth. This is a recordable achievement in our country's communication system.</p>
<h3>The Most Modern and Economical Social Interaction… Social Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Gu Xian</p>
<p>Mr. Ji Ran has already discussed the achievements of overseas social telegrams (see the previous issue of this publication). I also feel that it is necessary to promote (social telegrams) in our country under the (social modernization). I will briefly describe my humble opinions to offer to the majority of our people:</p>
<p>Although our country did not have the name (social telegrams) before, it actually had similar reciprocal telegrams. For example, telegrams used by warlords, bureaucrats, politicians, higher asset classes, and so-called celebrities for (celebrations and condolences). However, the telegrams were mostly written in ornate parallel prose, concocted by secretaries racking their brains, so-called (eulogies befitting the occasion), or copied from (worldly commendations… secret pillow books, etc.). This kind of writing is too corrupt and aristocratic. And the recipient, if they are military or political dignitaries, and the sender is an ordinary person or a casual acquaintance or subordinate, then the staff familiar with the telegraph code will only extract a gist, record it in a book, and have no time to translate the entire text. It is really meaningless.</p>
<p>Because telegram prices were too high, ordinary people rarely used them for social interaction in the past. Some people even rarely used telegrams for communication. If they happened to receive one from a family member working in another province, they would always fear bad news. The Ministry of Transportation has noticed this, so it advocates (social telegrams) with reduced prices to attract public use. Although it has not been implemented for long, the public lacks sufficient awareness of it. I believe that the people who receive and send (social telegrams) must have the following beliefs and make widespread use of them:</p>
<p>(1) The people who receive the most (social telegrams) are of course the people with the highest reputation in society. When overseas politicians take office, scientists have birthdays, a business succeeds, there is a groundbreaking discovery in academics, or explorers fail and sacrifice their lives, etc., they or their families receive countless (social telegrams) to show the public opinion (celebrating or mourning). In comparison, social figures in our country must have a thorough understanding and belief in this, especially our intellectuals, who should take the lead in promoting and implementing it to show that our culture is not backward and that our social interaction is (modernized)!</p>
<p>(2) People who send (social telegrams) do not need to know the other party or be necessarily relatives or friends. There are precedents in various countries. For example, if we have considerable faith or admiration for him or her and have the opportunity to express (respect), we can send a telegram. And whether the other party is a group or an individual, we can send it. Just like when an artist, Ms. Hu Die, and the famous Dr. Mei, are about to go to Beijing and Shanghai, we crave his and her art. And when the new poet Xu Zhimo died the year before, we were very sorry. We can send a social telegram to himself or his family to celebrate or other things. All matters that can be celebrated or mourned can use social telegrams!</p>
<p>(3) The text of (social telegrams) must not use (parallel) rotten formulas or classical-style writing. It is best to use words that are relevant and express considerable (sincerity).</p>
<p>(Example 1) Set (identifier) Changzhou Qingguoxiang, Mr. Chen Tianji, congratulations on graduation, bright future, Chen Yange (this telegram has 20 characters, costing four cents).</p>
<p>(Example 2) Set (identifier) Shanghai Hadong Road (134), Mr. Ma Shiqing and Ms. Qiu Hanqiu, happy wedding, Wang Dexin Zhang Yunlan Zhi. (This telegram has 23 characters, costing four cents and six cents. If two people share it, each person only pays two cents and three cents).</p>
<p>(Example 3) Set (identifier) Mr. Huang Xuchu of Peking Union Medical College, reported that your research in bacteriology has made considerable discoveries, congratulations to all mankind, Henan Pharmaceutical Association, (this place has 32 characters, costing six cents and four cents).</p>
<p>(Example 4) Set (identifier) No. 9, Zhugan Lane, Xi'an, family of Mr. Wang Rongchai, Mr. Wang has passed away, society deeply mourns, Chen Zhenya lives (this telegram has 26 characters, costing five cents and two cents).</p>
<p>(Example 5) Set (identifier) Chairman Song of Chahar, to the memorial service for the martyrs who died in the war of resistance against Japan, fighting for national glory, is a model for future generations, Anhui Hefei County Farmers and Merchants Association and various legal groups, (this telegram has 46 characters, costing nine cents and two cents).</p>
<p>(Example 6) Set (identifier) Chairman Lu of Hangzhou, reading the newspaper, your health is not well, I wish you a speedy recovery, to comfort the people of the province, Yan Zhongshan of Pinghu respectfully (this telegram has 32 characters, costing six cents and six cents).</p>
<p>(Social telegrams) The Ministry of Communications stipulates that incoming and outgoing telegrams are translated free of charge by (bureaus and stations). Place names and addresses, as well as personal names, are counted as five characters if they do not exceed 15 characters. However, the additional cost of the word Set (social telegram identifier) is charged. Whether it is a local province or a remote province, each character costs two cents, but each telegram starts at 20 characters. Cheap and effective, readers may wish to try it!</p>
<h3>Bi-Monthly News</h3>
<p>— Society Member</p>
<p>Improved Long-Distance Telephone Waiting Room The Ministry of Communications has noted that the long-distance telephone services attached to various telephone bureaus or telegraph bureaus have been thriving recently. Callers often have to wait in the waiting room for a long time due to no available lines or waiting for the called party to answer, which is often boring and uncomfortable. In order to improve the facilities of the waiting room, the Ministry of Communications has specially ordered all telephone bureaus and telegraph bureaus to decorate the long-distance telephone waiting room elegantly, and to provide newspapers and magazines for callers to rest and browse, so as to facilitate business. Formulation of Simple Comparison Table for Telephone Transmission of Foreign Telegrams Since the Ministry of Communications established the telephone transmission of telegrams, commercial firms in major commercial ports have been using the telephone to transmit telegrams with the telegraph bureau, which is both very fast and very convenient. However, when transmitting foreign telegrams, errors often occur because the personnel in charge of this matter in the commercial firms are not familiar with English or the pronunciation is not accurate. In order to facilitate merchants and eliminate errors, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated a simple comparison table for telephone transmission of foreign telegrams, which specifies a number to correspond to each letter of the English alphabet. When the pronunciation of a letter is unclear, the number can be read instead, which can identify the exact letter. Commercial firms can obtain this comparison table from various telegraph bureaus and stations free of charge.</p>
<p>Revision of Fee Collection and Restriction Measures for Official Car Telegrams The Ministry of Communications stated that the fee collection and restriction measures for official military telegrams revised in May of the 18th year have been in effect for more than five years, and the provisions therein are quite unsuitable for the current situation. Therefore, it has recently been revised again and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which was then submitted to the National Government for approval. The Ministry of Communications has now issued this measure to various telegraph bureaus and stations for compliance. Furthermore, the company has printed a separate copy of this measure, which will be sent upon request.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>We Need Europeanization</h3>
<p>— Ge Ren</p>
<p>The other day, I saw an article by someone on Europeanization. His idea was that the content of our country's literature is weak and lacks vitality, and we should learn as much as possible from Western European literature. His opinion is generally correct. True (Europeanization) must not be limited to wearing Western suits and eating Western food. This is especially felt in several more backward countries in the East. Before the Russian Revolution, many writers yearned for Western European civilization. Turgenev was a thorough Western Europeanist. In Japan, Hakuson Kuriyagawa, deeply nurtured by European literature, began to dislike the life of Eastern people and loudly declared the bankruptcy of Eastern civilization. Like European life, it should start from the flesh to the spirit. In recent decades, our country can be said to be in a turbulent era of rapid transformation. The old beliefs have become invalid, and the new ones have not yet been established. In this situation of scarcity, the internal contradictions of the era and society are reflected in the national psychology. Previously, we heard slogans welcoming Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science. The dazzling array of trends in the past twenty years can be regarded as a continuation of this slogan. Chinese society is a semi-colonial society, which not only contains compradores and national capitalists, but also feudal forces still stubbornly occupying it. This is a mysterious group unprecedented in ancient and modern times. The trends of thought emanating from this group are also strange trends of thought unprecedented at home and abroad, because all doctrines and theories have changed their form when they come to China. And the so-called Europeanization, after coming to China, has become girl singing and dancing troupes, Taohua River, storytelling, playing poker, and things like that. Despite putting on the outer clothing of capitalism, it is actually a feudal skeleton who is fascinated. This phenomenon is terrifying to think about.</p>
<p>In the past, in a novel, I saw someone persuading a Christian to drink beer, saying: (Christianity is from a foreign country, and beer is also from a foreign country. What's wrong with drinking it?) This sounds a bit ridiculous at first, but it can represent the psychology of a large part of our people, because we accept Western culture in our own (Chinese way).</p>
<p>As for literature, of course, it is also like this. Those engaged in literature are a more enlightened group of us, and now, many people are using New Sensualism as a signboard to describe the same content as Dream of the Red Chamber. What can we say about this? The form is new, the punctuation marks are all there, and the printing is probably the most authentic horizontal arrangement. If it is new poetry, it also uses rhythms, rhymes, and paragraphs that are not different from foreign countries. However, the content… this can't be managed, because we are undergoing (Europeanization), and this is precisely (Europeanization)!</p>
<p>Everything, all theories, will not produce results if they are not explored from the depths. A shallow sandy beach can only build crude shacks, but cannot support a towering building. The result of (Europeanization) is that our country has produced many fake scholars and gilded celebrities. From now on, the entire nation should start with genuine reform. We need (Europeanization), but we need bloody and fleshy (Europeanization) that we accept with a critical attitude, not superficial imitation. In terms of literature alone, the fluidity and vitality of Southern European life, and the seriousness and depth of Northern European life, as expressed in literature, are all for us to learn from, and become stimulants and blood cleansing agents for this ancient, dirty, weak nation. We want (Europeanization), why not give up those material enjoyments and start from here?</p>
<p>We need (Europeanization). As a member of a nation, we should think seriously, judge sharply, walk on the road of (Europeanization), and divide our lives and the lives of those hypocritically Europeanized modern gentlemen into two camps!</p>
<h3>Consolation</h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>In front of a person who is seriously ill and dying, if you nonchalantly say to him: (This disease is not very serious. It will be fine after taking one or two more doses of medicine.) Then he will naturally feel much more at ease. Perhaps the deadly disease will actually be gradually restored to health by the comfort of these two sentences. It is also possible. If you honestly tell him the danger of the disease, he will not die from the disease, but he may also be forced to death by anxiety and irritability. A person who is poor and downcast, facing setbacks on all sides, being ridiculed and despised by others everywhere, gradually becomes tired of the world and is eager to commit suicide: At this time, if you sincerely say to him: (What's the hurry? A person like you will never be poor for a lifetime. You should be patient for a while, maybe you will have a happy life tomorrow!) After saying this, it is best to cite the life stories of two or three historical heroes as examples. He will at least give up the idea of ​​dying.</p>
<p>People need a little comfort. Comfort is indeed like a refreshing medicine for a person who has nowhere to turn, with an unexpected power. If there were no such thing as (consolation) in the human world, life might lose a lot of its brilliance. However, comfort is only enough to relieve the immediate embarrassment; if you take (consolation) as the supreme panacea for living and hold on to it without letting go, then it will be terrible. Unfortunately, our compatriots often commit this problem of (holding on to it without letting go).</p>
<p>Our compatriots are probably extremely smart. They know deeply that the effect of (consolation) is so great. Whenever they are in a critical situation and cannot get comfort from others, they often comfort themselves. Ah Q, the typical representative of us Chinese, when being insulted and beaten by others, uses (son beating father) to comfort himself. Everyone is familiar with this fact (in fact, Ah Q is not someone else, he is originally ourselves.) Like him, he has achieved spiritual victory, but the insults and beatings are still suffered as before, and even, in the end, he cannot avoid being beheaded.</p>
