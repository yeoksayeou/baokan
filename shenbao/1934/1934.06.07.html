<p>時評</p>
<h3>蘇日衝突之現階段</h3>
<p>蘇日兩國近以北海漁業投標及盧布匯算比率問題。爭執頗烈。前此在中東路買賣會議席上。蘇聯方面採取故意延宕政策。已使日本感覺不安。甚至欲借此發揮其軍國主義之野心。頃者僞滿船「紀賢」號爲同江對岸蘇聯砲壘所轟擊。據蘇方所傳。謂「紀賢」號偸攝對岸形勢。彼爲自衛計。乃發警告。而日方則指蘇聯守兵擅自開砲。因此要求賠償道歉。并保證此後之安全。日蘇雙方自此案發生後。互相抗議。卽兩國新聞界之論戰。亦極盡反唇相稽之能事。茲事也。就目前情勢論之。自不至立卽擴大。以至於發生嚴重之戰禍。然履霜堅冰。其來也漸。日蘇兩國。互相警戒。已非一日。仇視之心理愈厚。則戰禍之爆發亦愈烈。不觀乎兩國陳兵邊境。壁壘森嚴。其空軍之整備。尤爲積極。固有劍㧞弩張之勢矣。</p>
<p>日軍而果進佔西比利亞。其第一步可得之實際利益。厥爲北庫頁島石油與北海漁業之獨覇。日本號爲世界五大强國之一。東向欲與北美合衆國在太平洋爭覇。西向欲攫取印度洋北岸之市塲。然彼天賦之薄。幾如歐洲之意大利。不惟鋼鐵消費。什九須仰給於外國。卽近代工業及戰爭所特需之石油。充其量亦僅能出産四十五萬噸。（連日人所經營之北庫頁油礦産額在内）其餘三百餘萬噸全賴海外之輸入。日人在北庫頁島油鑛開發租權。至一九三六年卽將滿期。日人現在該處所開採者。每日約有五百二三十噸。而俄人經營之産量。則已突過日人之上。俄人經營之兩處油區。其地下藏油量。據蘇聯學士院格布金氏之調查。至少當有四千萬噸之鉅。日本對此寳藏。垂涎欲滴。亟待藉端攫取。再言北海漁業競爭。在一九二八年日蘇締結漁業條約之際。日蘇雙方之漁業勢力。約爲日本漁人八與蘇聯漁人二之比例。日本占有絶對優勢。嗣因俄人急起直追。去年已成對等局面。一待蘇聯第二五年計劃完成。則日本漁人更難維持舊業。自在意中。此豈日所甘心者。</p>
<p>但北庫頁島氣候嚴酷。交通梗阻。沿岸甚鮮停舶船隻之適當港灣。而開採石油尤非短時期内所能奏功。日人縱以全力奪取俄人之土地而有之。實際上是否値得。大堪疑問。惟漁業利益之奪取。或不甚難耳。此種非和平武裝侵佔手段。前已見之於一九二○年間。其時日本曾向西比利亞出兵六師團。耗費五萬萬圓以上之金錢。而蘇俄方面僅由遠東極少數之遊擊隊與之週旋。終使日軍退出西比利亞而後已。今日之蘇聯。决非十五年前毫無抵抗力之蘇聯可比。日軍如侵入其領土一步。自必出而應戰。卽令日軍以交通上之便利。能於短時期内占領俄屬沿海州及烏蘇鐵道沿綫以至於赤塔。而貝加爾湖以西。决難輕易越過。據日本軍事專家之估量。僅僅占領東部西比利亞而保守之。至少須出兵五十個師團。若蘇聯積極應戰。恐非運用一百五十個師團之兵力不可。以今日日本之財政狀况而論。何足以語此。是以好大喜功之日本軍閥。雖屢唱征俄高調。仍未敢輕於挑戰也。</p>
<p>惟日本北侵之力雖不足。南略之力則有餘。如我國河北山東一帶所産之棉花。亦爲彼輕工業及軍火業所亟欲吸收之原料。而况商業市塲之重要。亦遠在北海漁區之上。今後趨勢。日本對蘇軍事或有採取守勢之必要。而對華侵略。必將繼續妄爲。而無所顧忌。則可預料者也。</p>

<h3>巴爾都與漢德森　舌戰聲色俱厲　代表口中之活劇　各方異見調和難</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今午後軍縮會主幹部開會時、富有經騐之兩雄辯家曾作劇烈之舌戰、針鋒相對、意氣激昻、此二主角、一爲軍縮會主席漢德森、一爲法外長巴爾都、惜新聞記者被擯旁聽、此一幕生動活躍之佳劇、僅能就與會代表之口中而知其一二、</p>
<p>今日午後主幹部會議延會半小時後、重行集議時、英掌璽大臣艾登發言贊助漢德森之决議案、此無異使軍縮會立卽休會、於是巴爾都乃發激烈之詞、反對漢德森决議案之全部、謂渠對於邀德重返會議、雖亦同意、但須出以正大光明之方法、而不得以「走後門之手段」爲之、巴氏並重申法國抱定主張之决心、當巴氏滔滔、發言之際、西班牙代表瑪達里亞迦插言阻之、巴氏乃忿然對瑪氏曰、君創一危險之前例、但在此時余亦不暇顧矣、聲言俱厲、如嚴師之對頑童、巴氏抨擊漢德森提案中之各點、幾令體無完膚、當時空氣緊張、漢德森聲言擬卽辭職、並召集總委員會、而向報告某某代表之阻撓、實使主幹部無法繼續其工作、漢德森謂渠之公正、如遭非難、則渠並擬以辭職書授予昔日舉渠爲軍縮會主席之羣彦、漢德森繼對會衆發警闢之詞、聽者皆大感動、其警語曰、「余今在此、不過爲世界數百兆靑年生命之保衛人、彼靑年之生命、皆在吾人之掌握中也」、於是迥面向巴爾都曰、「君如有提案、儘可提出」、漢德森續稱、渠所草定之决議案、當可獲多數之同意、渠未遺漏安全問題、巴爾都旣拒絶此案、應請其另擬一案、於是巴爾都起稱、渠頃間所發之言、乃以老國會議員對另一老國會議員一吐膈臆、絶無抨擊漢德森之意、故懇其仍任主席、巴爾都幾如道歉溫語向漢德森曰、漢德森君、爾秘留職、巴氏繼復縷縷陳述渠極尊重主席之絶對公正、渠言如有逾越辯論問題應守常禮之處、渠殊抱歉云、巴氏對於將來之手續、建議舉派一起草委員會、以融合俄國與中立國土耳其之提案爲務、至是漢德森乃宣布延會至明日午後三時三十分當散便時、英代表團極抱悲觀、覺各方面之異見、實無調和之機會、前途殊不堪設想云、（五日路透電）</p>

<h3>蘇日形勢弛緩中又漸緊急　（海參崴通信）　蘇俄在邊境積極佈防　風雲莫測的日蘇關係</h3>
<p>自本調集其兩個巨大師團駐紥中東路沿綫、（第三師團與第十六師團均駐中東路沿綫）又興築大興安嶺一帶堅固防禦工事後、實予蘇聯當局及其人民以莫大刺激、所以近來也有相當的防備第一是在邊境各重要地設置相當兵力、以備不測第二是擴大了海參崴附近的飛機塲、使其能容納多數的飛機、第三是海參崴港雖沒有什麽大强力的要塞備置、但有八艘最新式的潛艇、和必要的陸上配備在日本軍部方面的看法、以爲奪取海參崴是易如反掌的、因爲她并沒有充分堅固的工事足以抵當日本的優秀陸海軍、不過海參崴誠然不是一個攻不下的要塞、但也不是毫無防禦力的城市、實際是蘇聯在遠東的一個有力的軍事支點、特别是她的航空設備、日本是很恐怖的、不但像長春·哈爾濱·奉天·大連·漢城·這一類地方感受着海參崴飛機的威脅、卽東京·大阪也有些戒懼、怕不容易從容應付罷、</p>
<p>所以日軍尤其是在「滿洲」的關東軍、以爲假如日蘇一旦開戰、日軍須在最短時間幾個鐘頭或一兩天内攻下海參崴、否則日本内地卽有被轟炸之虞、可是照目前的情形、蘇聯旣已有了相當的凖備、陸海空三方面都有切實的做法（以記者的觀測决不至無抵抗而退却）日本關東軍方面也以爲海參崴這個小小的埠頭、很不容易在極爲時期内奪取過去、所以日軍於蘇聯空軍的襲擊、看起來很少有效的對策、</p>
<p>但是日本依然積極的在中東路沿綫進行着種種的軍事凖備、蘇聯當然也同樣的籌劃、近來發生的小事都是從彼此間的軍事對立出發的、五月十三日、在松花江與黑龍江交流的地方、在吉林是同江所屬地面、在蘇聯則爲米哈落、色米羅夫斯克管屬區域、有隻船呌作「紀賢」是掛傀儡旗號的、該船在江上三叉口行駛、據說是牠一面行船一面在測量蘇聯這邊的地圖并照相、因此受了蘇方三次警告、最後至於開空砲警告、還是無效、這纔實彈射擊、該船乃駛向松花江而去、事後、由哈爾濱北滿特派員公署對蘇聯總領事斯落斯基抗議、（一）要求賠償犧牲者的損失、（二）蘇聯方面道歉、（三）今後的保障、蘇方如何答覆、現在還不很知道、然而蘇聯的軍事準備却是越見緊張了、</p>
<p>這幾年來、赤軍軍備的進展、十分迅速、一九二七年其步兵師計六十九師、一九三一年增加到七十一師、一九三二年第一次五年計劃的末期、增加到七十六師、一九三三年底又增加了八個師、在同時期内飛行機由七百架、而一千六百、而二千五百、而三千架、坦克車則一九二七年祇一百架、一九三一年就五百架第一次五年計劃的末期爲一千五百架、一九三三年底數達三千架、在遠東方面的飛機有六百架、坦克車五百架、這是武器方面的凖備、但究竟祗是一部分的武裝在蘇聯還有更具體的凖備、第一她認爲近代戰爭沒有前方和後方的區别、戰塲應該包含其全部的國土、第二對於優秀敵軍的指導戰爭、是在乎使敵國軍隊内部崩潰、第三近代戰爭的特質是一國的工業力支配其軍事運命、第四消滅了和平與戰爭的境界、并不宣戰卽入於戰爭的狀態、第五要給那個國家戰爭的全部力量、卽工業力·人員·物質·資源·及國民的生活力、與以全體的致命傷、纔能使戰爭終結、總而言之、蘇聯不但整備要網羅其全國人民的戰爭、並且已經着着實行其包羅全國的軍事施設、在遠東雖未曾徹底的做但其規模已擴大到多方面、整備隨時應付事變、（五月二十二日於海參崴）</p>

<p>淮南煤礦旣具煤質優良、備量豐富、位置適當諸優點、其能蔚成大礦、絶可斷言、二十一年建設委員會簡任程志頤博士繼長該局、程局長鑒於外煤充斥、國煤被擯、非設法减輕成本、便利運輸、及擴大採煤設備、以增産額、增置營業設備、以利推銷不爲功、積極計劃擴充、不遺餘力、現礦山至洛河（淮河支流）一段、已敷設輕便鐵道十二公里、置有大小機車及煤車數十輛、洛河至蚌埠水道、亦自備輪船汽油船鐵駁船數十艘、專供運輸、營業方面、在洛河·蚌埠·浦口·各處、均設煤廠、二十二年六月、因淮渦兩河流域銷路、有與鄰礦大通合作必要、復在蚌埠成立兩礦聯合營業處、南京方面、並設有下關辦事處、代表礦局、接洽營業運輸等事項、此外又因津浦沿綫煤斤、皆行銷長江流域、而以浦口爲陸運尾閭、現在浦口鐵路碼頭已無餘隙可堆存大量煤斤、各礦營銷方面、均大感困難、且與中興·烈山·華東·華豐·大通·集議、合資組織公棧碼頭公司、資本一百五十萬元、該礦股份佔總額八分之一、現公司已成立、碼頭地址、業經測定、俟設計工作完竣、亦卽開始建築、</p>

<h3>出席萬國郵會回來　黃乃樞已返國　黃談我方提案通過者甚多　報告書編竣後入京就新職</h3>
<p>中央社云、前郵政總局局長黃乃樞氏、於去歲奉派出國、赴埃及出席萬國郵政會議、繼赴歐美各國、考察各國郵政情形、業已公畢、於四日乘坐大來輪船公司胡佛總統號輪抵滬、現正彙編此行報告書、一俟告竣、卽入京晉謁朱部長、並就郵政司長新職、中央社記者、六日晨往訪黃氏於郵政總局、詢以此行經過、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>出席萬國郵會</h3>
<p>據黃氏談、萬國郵政會議、每隔五年舉行一次、專討論修改萬國郵政條例等、此次開會地點、在埃及京城開魯舉行、於二月一日開幕、至三月二十日閉會、會期約五十日、對於萬國郵政條例之修改及各國郵費之增减、詳加討論、已有决定、定於明年一月一日施行、我方出席代表爲胡世澤·張歆海·及本人三人、所提案件、經大會通過者亦不少、其詳細情形、當呈報朱部長後再行發表、至於日本嗾使東北僞組織攫奪郵務問題、大會中則未提出討論、</p>
<h3>考察歐美郵政</h3>
<p>黃氏繼又謂、本人於萬國郵政會議閉幕後、卽赴歐美各國考察各國郵政情形、計經歐洲者、爲意·法·比·德·捷克·瑞士·英·奥·等八國、經美洲者、爲加拿大·及美利堅·兩國、沿途加以考察、限於時間、不及詳細調查、此行考察所得、覺歐美各國交通便利、機件精良、郵務當易於發展、至於其他種種優點、適合於外國者、是否亦適用於我國、當加以研究、現在集編意見書、以供當局採納、</p>
<h3>在滬編報告書</h3>
<p>黃氏因此行經菲歐美三洲、費時五個半月、遠遊歸來、擬在滬作若干日之休息、乘此休息期内、彙編出席萬國郵政會議及考察各國郵政報告書、何日入京、尙難决定、且考察歐美各國、限於時間、車馬所經、不及一一詳加考察者、輙留書面文件、向該地詢問、是項答復文件、尙在途中、故彙編報告書、當俟是項文件完全運到後、始能完竣、至於本</p>
<p>人就任郵政司長新職、須俟入京晋謁朱部長後、再定確期、黃氏最後又稱、郵政總局遷京問題、現尙難實現、因京地新局房屋、尙未告竣云云、並悉黃氏將於日内返杭州原籍一行云、</p>

<h3>華商紗廠一部份將停工　大部份已實行減工减薪　並將條陳當局請予救濟</h3>
<p>新聲社云、華商紗廠、自受市塲衰落、原棉價漲後、虧蝕更鉅、前週市價、雖見回漲、惟近日以來、仍然暴跌不已、同時原棉漲風未見下降、故其成本、日有抬高之勢、新聲社記者、昨據該業中人談、現有一部份紗廠將見停工、一部份廠業已實行减工减薪、並聞紗廠業將條陳當局、請求救濟、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>夏節難過實行停工</h3>
<p>據稱、紗業之衰落原因頗多、目前情形、更難言喻前途岌岌可危、挽救實無善策、長此以往、將蒙不可預測之损失、但棉紗爲我國重要實業之一、苟任其破産、則市塲必爲外貨侵佔故廠方在此情况之下、實屬一籌莫展、而今夏節（端午節）將屆、結賬無欵以待、故近日以來、一部份實力較薄之紗廠、將於節前實行停工、設法過此關節、復工之期、須待夏令之後、再視市塲之情形如何而定、</p>
<h3>减工减薪大部實行</h3>
<p>至於減工减薪、確爲補救紗業衰落唯一辦法、蓋此係勞資合作、在廠方旣免停工、在勞方可免失業、惟此事全視勞方之能否合作耳、然於此景况之下、勢在必行、無可諱言、最近紗廠中實行減工減薪者、巳有數家、而其中某廠係屬自動、頗具勞資合作之精神、其他廠家除决定節前暫時停工者外、大都卽將實行、刻正洽商辦法、預料日内當</p>
<p>可全部實現、</p>
<h3>條陳當局請求救濟</h3>
<p>現在紗業虧本、較之麵粉爲甚、再過一二月、資本厚者、此種損失、亦必不堪負擔、而實力較薄者、實難抵此巨虧、是故紗廠爲維持國家實業勉圖生存計、在此存亡旦夕、一籌莫展之時、除停工減工外、特條陳當局、請求詳細調查、迅予救濟、俾危若累卵之紗業、得到一綫希望、外貨乘機侵襲、庶幾可免云、</p>
<h3>實部救濟國煤　派員先赴各省調查</h3>
<p>中央社云、我國煤産營業、日見衰落、不能與外煤競爭市塲、實業部爲謀救濟起見、上月特派專門委員陳同之·偕同本市國煤委員會委員、前往河南調查煤産情形、茲悉各委業於昨日分返京滬、記者昨訪國煤委員會委員某君、據談救濟國煤之意見如次、</p>
<h3>限制與救濟</h3>
<p>據稱、今日欲謀救濟國煤、須先從限制入手、限制分三點、（一）限制礦債、（二）限制産量、（三）限制營業區域、在合理的限制下、大家須共守契約、然後方於事有濟、此與道德心與義務均有關係、必如此然後再可進一層說到救濟、救濟分三層、（一）金錢之救濟、因資本有大小、故金錢有多寡之懸殊、宜分别與以補劑、若有陷於艱窘者、又加救濟、（二）産量之救濟、産量有大小不同、某處礦大産多、某處礦少産薄、彼此富乏溢缺之間、大有甚酌損益之處、（三）地理之救濟、煤産區域、有遠近之不同、斯供給需求上有異、譬如我國銷煤四大區、如天津廣東漢口上海、因與産煤區有遠近之殊異、運輸方面、宜如何救濟之、實亦切實之問題、惟無論金錢産量地理、統與時局有關、時局能使廠商窮或富、能使産量贏或虧亦能使地理環境有變遷也、</p>
<h3>如何去競爭</h3>
<p>煤産有官礦、有華洋合辦、有商辦、其天然利益雖同　商辦則勢力似稍薄弱自不能有一律待遇之機會、今後政府謀救濟國産之</p>
<p>煤、當能努力於此點、譬之父兄敎育子弟、盡其力量、使之受水平綫以上之敎育、至於以後能否向上發展、則是其本身進取問題矣、進取之機會如何、雖爲之父兄者、亦不能予以如何推進之力量、我國煤産不能與人競爭、乃因事業組織、本末倒置之故、當上海商埠初開闢時、日煤卽已襲進、繼之洋商之煤、源源而來、彼時吾國尙無鐵路、自更無煤可以與人競爭、今吾人若言救濟之道、第一、必須謀自給自足、因自己無貨、空口言抵制、實屬無補、同業中人亦應抱共存共榮之旨、不互相猜忌、用通盤眼光、在國家觀點上着想、則外煤不言抵制而自抵制、否則僅在營業盈虧上注意、銷塲一不佳、卽瘏口曉音、倡言抵制、可决其於事無補、</p>
<h3>今後之調查</h3>
<p>現實業部有鑒於此、故召集專家、先從事於調查、河南煤産調查尙未蕆事、本月十五日以後、尙擬再去、以後更將赴山西河北各省一行、惟調查之事、亦至不易言、如不能取得人之信仰、各廠商將不願出其資料、貢獻吾人、蓋恐調查結果、於彼營業上受有影響也、但本人願本此志、使同業先能信任、信任一生、則無往不利、救濟國煤之道、亦不外乎是云、</p>

<h3>南洋華僑沈良牧　談考察感想　今日赴汕港返星洲覆命</h3>
<p>南洋華僑聯合通訊社社長沈良牧氏、受南洋華僑委託、回國考察新聞事業及政治經濟狀况、抵滬後、曾赴南京·杭州·等地視察、並訪黨國領袖及工商界要人、交換意見、現任務已畢、今日離滬、轉赴汕頭·香港·等處、作短時間之考察、卽行返星覆命、新聲社記者、昨往訪於靑年會、蒙告考察感想、分誌如下、</p>

<h3>專件　外人曲解引水條約之辯正（五）　中國引水公會籌備會宣言</h3>
<p>關於中法條約之解釋及事實、中法條約、雖然有「凡人執有三張船長證書者、得由法領派充爲引水人、」此段條約文字、最爲含混、蓋如當時中國果將引水之權讓於法人云、則條約儘可明白規定、中國船隻、到達中國口岸、當由法國引水人帶領可矣、何以必須領事派遣、又何以必須執有三張船長文憑始得派遣乎、吾人研究結果、對此有確切不移之解釋、卽當時中國處於閉關時代、雖政府對外國間容有諒解、准許通商、而民間百姓、則保持其强固自尊自重之觀念、對於外舶之侵入、當然視爲可恥、而當時之中國水道、標誌毫無、遠非今日可比、故外船出入、非借重中國引水人不可、亦可說當時引水、本來全屬中國人、但中國大部份的民衆、爲自尊自重之觀念所驅使、所以儘管外船來到、雖對引水人啗以厚利、而應者絶少、卽間或有人應募、引外船進口、官廳雖不加阻止、而民衆之間、鮮有不加此應募人以漢奸之誹議、故外船往往進口不感困難、而出口則爲引水人關係、常常爲之稽延時日、此所以中美·中英·等等條約、均有有權自由僱用引水之規定之所由來也、唯中法此約所以獨異於衆者、實由法國訂約之年代較前、對於僱用中國引水更感困難、故當時在法國之意、只須求得有引水人、卽爲足事、不必限爲中國人、但領海卽屬中國、卽自有其主權、故用三張船長文憑以爲限制、以見此舉之不得已、而示尊重中國主權於無可如何之中、不然、中國旣處於閉關時代、對於外來船隻、當然少一隻好一隻、則三張文憑云云於中國有何干係、卽使法領當時將不辨船頭船尾之人派充引水、或甚而至於將船打碎、則對中國正所謂吹皺一池春水干卿底事、而必須載入條約乎、故所謂三張文憑云云、雖有佞口、可决其無較此更近情理之解釋、其次則以事實證之、如中國當時果已將引水之權讓給法人、並有條約爲之根據、則自訂約以後、中國口岸雖不必盡爲法籍引水所佔有、至少總應有法人之踪跡、何以一八六八年（在中法訂約後二十四年）總稅司赫德呈總理衙門之正式統計、竟無法籍一人充引水在内、此實當時中國政府、並未將引水權讓給法人之强有力的反證、亦卽三張船長證書可以任引水一節、爲意在尊重中國主權之正證、此外則吾人詳參各條約多發現「有權自由僱用買辦」之規定、其文字及語氣、與有權僱用引水一條正復相同、今買辦一職已相沿數十年、均由華人充任、則由今反推、當時所謂僱用引水之引水實與買辦相同、全屬華人、若將引水二字加以曲解、則不但在當時之情形說不過去、卽此類之條約文義、亦不能有圓滿的解釋、</p>
<p>唯此項條約文字、終屬含混、也許當時法人故意爲此、以便將來有所影射或曲解、今日殆已無人能予證明、惟觀於中國以後與各國間所定之條約、如中美·中英·中比·中挪·中瑞·中葡·中丹中義·中西·中日·等等只給各國以自由僱用引水的權、而不及其他、則可證明中法條約云云、之確未將此權斷送、因爲列强對於中國的利益、向來是均沾的、（該報所引莫氏原文、對於好的錨地、大家都要搶、何况其他、）今觀於以後種種條約、並無有外人得充引水之權、則又可反證中法訂約之時、實未嘗將充任引水之權給予法人、事實甚明、至於該記者認中美·中英·等條約、有自由僱用引水之權、卽作爲各國有自由充任我國引水、纂據我國引水之權、則只有該記者有此種理論、此種羅輯、吾人只可作笑話看、用不着反駁也、</p>
<p>其次則義大利條約、亦只明白規定、有僱用引水之權、其所謂另定章程及須與各國領事商定者、只爲引水費之價値、試讀中義條約第三十四條之約文、「義國船隻欲進各口、聽其僱覓引水之人、完淸稅務之後、亦可僱覓引水之人帶其出口、所給引水工銀、及引水人等、應遵規條、地方官會同領事官酌量定立、」似此條文、則雖一般之小學生、亦能識其只限於引水費一端、乃該記者强將引水費改爲引水權、以便擴充其範圍、不亦心勞而日拙乎、至於吾人對於該記者所用以惑人之工具、也就是向來洋先生們、對我們所演的西洋鏡、已完全戳穿、縱讓你搬演得說得天花亂墜、只是一錢不直、只是虚僞而已、在條約旣失其根據之後、該記者的是聰明、乃轉其目光於私人的著作、但吾人所討論者、本爲條約問題、縱令莫司氏爲萬國公法著作家的威權者、其言亦只可作爲學者間的討論、與條約何干、難道莫司氏對中國再說得不堪一點、中國卽應對之負若何義務乎、况莫司氏所舉牛莊　埠時、英領事所定之引水章程、實際並未爲中國政府所承認、故小之可諉爲私人之輕舉、大之可認爲對他國之無禮、</p>
<p>最後我們來說我們所最痛心的赫德章程、</p>
<p>按照同治七年、赫德呈報總理衙門的統計、爲同治六年三月至同治七年三月、一年間所有各口引水人、共計二零三名、中國爲一零三名、英人四十名、美人三十五名、德人十名、丹人六名、瑞人六名、荷蘭人二名、奥人一名、可是在赫德訂立引水章程以前、有二事應予注目、卽（一）外人雖有在我港口充引水者、但其人數合併計之、尙不及中國之多、（二）此種外籍引水人之充任中國引水、雖中政府未加取締、但至少係未獲有法律的承認的行動、而自赫德章程訂立以後、亦有二事堪予注目、即（一）外藉人民自此以後、在中國充任引水人、雖不能說有法律的根據、然最少可說是有了官的保障、（二）有選引水之權、完全操之外人、所有華籍引水在一年之中、均被排斥凈盡是也、這種事實、當然表示的是赫德對中國的盡忠、値得像該記者輩爲之謳歌、不過吾人在這類事實以外、更發現了章程的中西譯文的兩歧、這種道德上的責、又應由何人負責呢、但赫德先生往矣、吾人只願怪吾人之不自競、及前淸總理衙門之尸居餘氣、而不願多所論斷、惟吾人决不願埋沒事實、因此吾人不得不有所舉似、將令吾國同胞對於我們的客卿有所認識、或至少對於赫德先生或凖赫德先生、應有一種澈底的認識、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣才不會做「書獃子」（續）</h3>
<p>— 丨答巫善伯君丨</p>
<p>所謂新的門徑是什麽，怎樣讀書方不致變爲「書獃子」呢？無疑地，我們的回答，是針對着如前面所述的三種錯誤的讀書法而來的。</p>
<p>首先，我們的讀書，應該不是死讀，而是活讀，我們不是爲讀書而讀書，而是爲我們的生活，爲我們所處的社會的需要而讀書。理論是實　生　的指導，實際生活是理論的内容，我們縱不　認爲實際生活可以包括讀書，我們也决不能把讀書和實際生活分離。在這社會上，我們是和旅行家一樣生活着，我們已有各地「指南」供我們旅行的參考，但假使我們只抱住那些「指南」，而不作實際的旅行，那末，「指南」上所描繪的一切、要不過「空中樓閣」而已。所以、我們「不獨不可以」「兩耳不聞窗外事」的來讀書，面目應該，十二分的應該挾着書包，走到十字街頭，進入羣衆隊伍裏去，細心地觀察社會認識社會，使所讀的書，與現社會互相印證：所獲的知識，不僅是書本上的知識，乃是滲透了實踐的知識，所有的見解，並不是書生的見解，乃是富有實踐意義的見解。俗語說：「練達人情卽學問，」這在反「書獃子」的意義上，是値得我們吟味的。</p>
<p>我們均是困於生活的人，離開我們的生活，我們並沒有那些閒暇關在房子内去讀那些無用的死書。當我們拿起書本的時候，我們必定先要問一問自己，這類的書與生活與社會究有若何的關係，我們應該怎樣付給所讀的書以更新的意義。譬如研究航空吧，航空是否當前的急要，這是一問題，但最重要的問題還不在此，而是在我們學會了航空，是爲了打誰呢？還是爲了大衆天空的交通呢？這問題有了回答，於是我們便把所學和打倒帝國主義或航運這一實踐連繫起來，我們的航空知識乃成爲有實踐意義的知識。否則航空救國也不過是「書生之見」罷了。又譬如：我們是店員學徒，我們必然要學習一點商業上的知識，但我們要問：有了一點商業的知識，是不是就可以避免失業的危險呢？如果要解答這問題，顯然這是不够的，於是我們一定要深入到環繞着我們的社會内去，尋出其根原。</p>
<p>所以，當我們無論讀什麽書，或者研究某一學科的時候，我們决定的準則，應該以社會的需要爲凖則；我們以現實作爲批評的尺度。我們要把讀書與我們的實踐配合起來，這樣的讀書，才不是製造「書獃子」的讀書。</p>
<p>以上僅是原則上的說明，再後我們可談一談具體的方法了。如前面所述及、我們讀書，決不能亂讀，而要有系統。怎樣才是有系統的讀書呢？第一，卽所謂循序漸進。一個剛生下幾個月的孩子，要牠吃麵包，自然是消化不了的。以前的敎書先生，便往往犯了這個毛病，雖然他們口内還不住唸着孔二先生，欲速則不達的遺訓。他們一開始便敎孩子們讀四書五經，試問，四書五經，是初學的人所能懂的嗎？我們看到讀十幾年老書的人，文字上常不如一個初級小學生寫得通順，便完全是這個道理。所以，我們讀書决不能獵等，决不能好高騖遠，丨丨應由文字的解釋，而至普通智識的獲得，再而至於專門科學的研究。如果我們進到專修某一學科的時候，我們應該注意的，便是確定我們的立塲，我們先站在一種特定的理論基礎上，來選擇我們所要讀的書，我們先從在理論上有統一性的那部份書讀起，等到有了根底，才可以把範圍擴大，進而研究名流派的著述，因爲這時候，我們已有批評的能力，我們再不會受書的欺騙了。</p>
<p>其次，便是融化。要怎樣才能融化所讀的書呢？這也並不是一個很困難的問題。我們無論讀那一本書的時候，我們不要死記住其文句，或公式，我們應該對於每一公式，理解以後，反復舉出自己的例證。如果研究社會科學，你便可以把你一切所見所聞的社會現象作爲書上的例證，這樣，書本上的内容，必然的就成爲自己的理論的内容了。</p>
<p>本文因爲限於篇幅，所說容有未盡，但讀者如果能照這樣讀書，我們以爲，如巫君一樣成爲「書獃子」的事情，當不致發生罷。</p>
<h3>淸德齡公主原著　御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>他把這個番鼓掛在他的助手的背上，他自己就站在後面，用兩根不很粗的鼓搥，一下一下的打着。這種番鼓所發出來的聲音，簡直是比銅鑼更單調。我們倘用一枝竹筷在桌子上敲打，就會發出同樣的聲音來。還有啄木鳥在林子裏工作的時候，也有這種相類的響聲。番鼓的聲音雖是這樣的單調不悅耳，可是它在整個樂隊裏面，却佔着很重要的地位；它是和磬或銅鑼一般的用以調整節奏的。</p>
<p>我覺得「九音鑼」在這些樂器裏頭，可算是最有趣味的一種了丨它所發出來的聲音，全是中國歌譜中實在應用的音階。它的搆造也並不複雜，本身只是一個木架子而已。這個木架子的式樣和我前面所講的用以安放各種樂器的那個大架子大略相同，丨丨大架子高約五英尺，濶約八英尺，底下的兩個木脚，都是很沉重的，又是展開得很闊的，所以無論上面掛多少樂器，也不至有頭重脚輕的現象，就是遇到有風的時候，也不會把它吹倒的。丨丨可是這個九音鑼的架子，却祗有十八英寸高，一英寸闊。它一共有三根橫檔，順次釘着，距離完全相等。每一根橫檔上，各有三面小小的銅鑼懸掛着；而在最上的一根橫檔的背後，另有一個鈎子，這就是用以掛在那個大架子上去的。（五一）</p>
<h3>東北四連長　第三十回目送哀鴻埋頭守國土彈穿勁譬灑血染孤城</h3>
<p>因爲趙自强對老百姓的態度，發生了疑問，就不曾回連本部去，暫時站在空地裏，留看一個究竟。起先是老百姓絡繹不絶，還是向營部走去。過了約半小時，他們由營部走了出來。那臉上的顔色，個個蒼白。有的身體抖顫，簡直垂着眼淚哭了起來。趙自强心裏想着怪呀，他們有什麽不對，受了營長的申斥嗎？於是拉住了一個老百姓，問道：你們這是怎麽回事？那人道：你們營長對我說，小鬼就要打到這裏來了。他們的飛機厲害，在半天雲裏會亂扔炸彈的。我們老百姓，又不打仗，老在裏住着作什麽？他勸我們在明日一天之内，要搬得乾乾凈凈。我們這樣好的家，怎麽捨得丢開？就算我們不在乎罷。請問，猛然間一跑，呌我們向那裏走呢？趙自强道：這個樣子，你們是打算不走了。那百姓皺了眉道：營長呌我們走，總是好意，呌我們說什麽好呢？過一天再說罷。趙自强聽老百姓的話，也明白他們的用意了，還是在那裏觀望，便道：你們是打算看看風勢再走吧？不過到了那個時候，讓不讓你們看風勢，那可是說不定了。老百姓聽了這話，雖然覺得也是對的，但是他並不肯照了自强的話，歎了幾口無聲的氣，也就走回走了。自强兩手挿在褲子袋裏，將脚尖點在地上，抬起脚後跟來，將身子連連聳了兩聳。（四○二）</p>
<h3>春蓴勝秋蓴</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>到西湖去，總得喫蓴菜湯，因此西湖的蓴菜和醋溜魚，成爲唯二的下酒物。會做生意的杭州人，裝了瓶子賣到别處去，又和藕粉成爲唯二的特産品了。但是蓴菜的傳名，還得讓傳名，還得讓我們的吳江最早。東晋張季鷹先生丨翰丨在齊王冏的幕府裏，忽地因了秋風起，想着吳中菰菜蓴羹鱸魚膾，便浩然歸故鄕。至今吳江中學還有三高祠遺留着，他老先生被尊爲三高之首，那麽蓴菜的因人而重，不消說得了。可是蓴菜在春天最嫩，到了秋天，就遠不及了。張老先生不過借此賦歸去來辭，並不是說一定要秋蓴纔够味呢。</p>
<p>明韓奕有詠蓴菜的詩：采蓴春浦作羹嘗，玉滑絲柔帶露香，却笑張翰未知味，秋風起後却思鄕。也是賞識春蓴，並且也在譏笑張老先生的不知味。韓老先生確是知味者，玉滑絲柔帶露香七個字，的確刻畫得十二分的入彀。我常聽見喫過蓴菜的人說，滋味竟沒有什麽好處，因爲他們不能像韓老先生般得到它的奥妙。並且大槪總是用鷄湯猪油燒得很濃重，好像把鄕下人硬拉到都市裏來，那裏還能得到它的天眞趣味呢。</p>
<p>金鶴望師爲詩不詠物，不和韵，獨爲龐山湖（在吳江之東産蓴最著）蓴賦長古寵之，有云：「柔魂水乳交，膩理冰唾黏。」能曲狀其妙。又云：「張翰思秋風，秋蓴老蒼蒹，採摘當及時，春浪桃花添。」也說春蓴勝於秋蓴</p>
<p>這幾天到蘇州來的，大槪總要嘗試這春蓴的，最好預先分付厨下，不要燒得太油膩，至多加些蔴菇在裏面就够了；並且須把黏液多保留些。</p>
<h3>摘玫瑰</h3>
<p>— 朱戳</p>
<p>在這綠緑芭蕉，紅了櫻桃的初夏，玫瑰花早紅艷艷地發出醉人的甜香。在好夢初回的當兒，那一聲聲呌賣「玫瑰花」的聲浪，隨着一片市聲，淸脆宛轉地送上枕來。</p>
<p>玫瑰確是可愛的花兒；色、旣那麽的艷麗，香，又那麽的甜凈，並且他的味兒，無論釀酒，品茗，製醬，造糖，都是那麽芬芳襲人，香留齒類。玫瑰眞是百花中特出的異品，色香味，皆上上，玫瑰眞當之無愧！</p>
<p>可是玫瑰雖是色艷味香！然而自有他倔强的性兒，那尖銳的刺兒，使一班遇花卽折的輕薄兒，不敢輕易蹂躪。「玫瑰有刺，銀瀑含泥」，正是他特有的個性，那扎手的刺它，决不是一班隨波逐流的輕薄楊花，所能望其項背！</p>
<p>玫瑰的吃法；泡茶，最爲簡易，祇須將花朶兒焙乾，就可和茶葉同泡。製酒的手續，稍微複雜些，將花瓣兒摘下，浸入膏梁，再和以冰糖，大約隔一月左右；就香甜可食了。製糖的方法，也是　　日内瓦奇覌！士英</p>
<p>先將花瓣摘下，在霜梅（南貨店有出售）水中，略浸一下，再在乾毛巾中將水按去，然後入盆搗爛，再和以白糖，搗抖均匀，製成各種花樣，先在灰上，舖了油紙，將水分吸去，然後再左石灰上焙乾卽成。製醬的方法，和製糖彷彿，不過在白糖搗匀以後，卽放入磁缸，過了半個月，缸内的玫瑰和糖，就熟爛如醬了。</p>

<p>中國畫會不少，而女子開展覽會，此尙爲第一聲。余特撥冗往觀，會塲在寗波同鄕會四樓，四壁琳瑯，佳作林立。楊雪玖之山水，生氣磅礴，魄力渾雄。顧飛之山水，淸逸無塵，逈非凡品。陳小翠之仕女，秀潤淸麗，别有風趣，自是詩人之筆。内有屏條四幅，爲天虚我生及小蝶題詞，所寫仕女。雅澹欲絶，眞似不食人間烟火食者。丁筠碧作花鳥，有一幅寫一翠鳥，銜魚欲飛，彌饒天趣，馮文鳳之書法，遒勁無匹，塲中陳其作品特多。吳靑霞之山水仕女，俱縝密有致，田家樂尤佳。余靜芝之仕女，工緻細膩。唐冠玉謝月眉龐左玉之花卉，俱端正凝秀，繼響南田。謝應新之曉風殘月，李秋君之管夫人，顧靑瑤之大幅山水，俱爲余所欣賞者，惜怱怱不及周覽，想遺珠尙多，此文不過記其大略耳。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>嚴陵釣壇應在富春山及其他（下）</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>至於嚴子陵耕釣之區，陳君硬說他「也許爲了七里瀧的鱸魚太好，所以不憚百里路，從富腸趕到七里瀧去」有話，那全是以一見之偏，不惜猜度杜撰，以文飾自己的理拙。上文我已證明七里瀧就在富春山下，何必要勞子陵走百里之遙？現再伸引嚴陵耕釣决在一處，而不如陳君所說的一在富陽之縣，一在嚴陵之瀬。另外陳君還說嚴陵瀬的石寳，或爲子陵的别墅，更屬可笑！</p>
<p>果然後漢書列傳，與晉皇甫謐的高士傳，律寫着同樣的文句：「除爲諫議大夫，不屈，乃耕於富春山，後人名其釣處爲嚴陵瀬焉。」陳君於是引此古文，闡明富春山是富春山，而嚴陵瀬是嚴陵瀬；說其間有百里之遙。殊不知文章作法者矣！依據陳君之意，這段文字，應該衍如下的成方式，才能看得一目了然？丨丨　　「······不屈，乃耕於富春山，釣於富春江，後人名其耕處爲富春田，（或嚴陵田），名其釣處爲嚴陵瀬焉，」這還成什麽樣子？（引古文省字法作起相類的反證是不憂資料不豐富的）</p>
<p>陸放翁嚴州釣台買田記中：「······獨念初赴郡，過七里瀬漢嚴先生釣臺下。······讀唐興元　崔儒釣臺記，以爲上有平田百畝，足以力耕；下臨淸流，足以垂釣；今投釣之地具在，而田則亡有，……會有没官田，又從傍買民田足百畝，除其泛科歛，以畀浮屠之奉祠者。又卽祠之右，創爲佛院，棲鐘鼓於樓，匱經於室，僧廬客館，略皆有所。······則先生之祠，可以永世不廢。······」</p>
<p>謝翺登西臺慟哭記：「······及今而哭於子陵之臺，······登岸謁子陵祠，憇池旁僧舍，毁垣杜甃，如入墟墓······登西臺，設主於荒亭隅，再拜跪伏······於是相感喟，復登東臺，撫蒼石，還憇於榜中。······」</p>
<p>依上二文一看，前者證明耕釣在於一處；後者表白了釣臺便在一般公認爲嚴先生祠堂所在的富春山上。我們實在也不曾聽見過離嚴陵瀬百里的富陽縣，有着嚴先生的祠堂，釣壇；也不曾聽見過「釣臺是否在富春山上」的這驚人疑問！</p>
<p>總之，陳君提出來的「釣壇不在富春山」這問題，却是節外生枝。不過同時我也搜得兩條關於嚴子陵垂釣處的懷疑斷文，都出自姚培謙的類液上，姑誌於下：</p>
<p>類腋卷四杭州川類下赤松山條下，注有「富陽東，「名赤亭山，通志：赤松子駕鶴時停此山，嚴陵釣於此臺，基尙存。」同書同卷桐洲條下，注有「富陽西南，有石瀬，相傳子陵垂釣處。」前者不敢說是眞，因爲赤亭山應在甘肅，而赤松山也當在金華縣北之明黃初平叱石成羊處；釣基是否存在，更不可知。後者，以意度之，當卽爲今嚴陵瀬釣磯原處，因那裏也有劉家洲大小孔洲等沙灘，自然不能斷定没有桐洲。也許陳君對此二條，有着另外考據發現，故確認嚴陵釣壇不在富春山上，那我們不妨再細細探尋其出處如何？</p>
<p>末了，我得聲明，這雖是一個很平凡的學術研究，但我手頭並沒有嚴州府志可考，所以倘有錯誤，還望讀者敎正，不過凡遊嚴陵釣臺者，莫不以釣臺所在處爲嚴陵山（卽富春山），那是鐵一般的事實！陳君所指之嚴山，究竟在富陽縣的那一處，或卽我所確認爲桐廬縣之嚴陵山，亦望有以指示！再者，陳君行文中有「卽使當時尙未有桐廬的名目，」「也許就呌做嚴山，」「或者就因鱸魚的風味······」「或者就是他的别墅」等句法，我以爲一個考據學者，不應有此空泛的假定與模稜兩可的態度！</p>

<p>主席報告周廳長略謂、體育爲一般人所忽視、以爲無關重要、實屬錯誤、體育小而言之、關係個人健康、大而言之、亦可謂爲國家民族生存之要素、自「九一八」事變發生後、救國聲浪、甚囂塵上、有主張航空救國者、立塲不同、主張自然各異、不可言其非是、但航空救國未免是部分的、而不是具體的、吾人倡體育救國、則敢言此係包括全體的體育救國、雖不能認爲唯一的方策、但至少爲基本的條件、例如外人駕駛飛機、飛行至十餘小時、平常得很、而國人僅能支持至五六小時、此卽係體格不如外人之明證、現時以一般情形言之普通民衆、尙在水平綫上、而在校學生之體格、竟日趨衰弱、前在南京聽得一招考憲兵檢查體格之結果、中高以上之學生、僅有百分之二十合格者、此種情形、實是骇異、江南素稱文弱、對於靑年體格、尤須注意此次會議最注重者、計有兩點、（一）關於部頒課程標凖、（二）關於最低設備標凖此外個人有數點意見不但望會議時注意、卽平時亦應注意、一·須「普遍」及「有恒」「普遍」又百分爲人的普遍、及種類發展、「有恒」卽須注意平時訓練不但在運動塲中注意、並應隨時隨地注意、不但於運動會時注意、卽會後亦應繼續注意運動會、僅爲一手段、而不是目的、我們的目的、是普遍是有恒的訓練不可倒因爲果、二·每一個動作、必須實在、否則必有下列兩弊、甲·無效果、乙·不能盤齊畫一、希望各位負責做去、平時上課、均應眼到、口到、手到、如此始可達到目的、三·嚴格一點、尤須注意、如因嚴格而轉發生風潮則廳中絶對負責、本廳自下學期、呈將設體育督察、對於合格的體育切實指導云、</p>

<h3>積極建設大上海　市立體育塲實行動工　成泰廠以八十七萬餘元得標　建造籌備奠基禮將於明年七月中完工</h3>
<p>籌備經年、工程偉大之本市市立大體育塲、業已正式開始動工、定於明年七月完成、市當局將舉行隆重之奠基典禮、明年十月間之全國運動大會、卽在該塲舉行、特探誌各情如次、</p>
<h3>開始動工一年完成</h3>
<p>上海市立大體育塲、由吳鐵城市長發起興築、全部經費百萬元、並由國内體育專家沈嗣良·馬約翰·董守義·王正廷·褚民誼諸氏參與設計審查圖樣係由建築師董大酉負責設計、經數度審查修正、始獲通過、並於五月間舉行招標承辦建造工程、業已於本月四日下午二時、在市府工務局禮堂實行開標、計投標者有著名營造廠十餘家、成泰廠以八十七萬八千二百零三元之最低數得標、經市府審查後、雙方卽簽訂合同、已開始動工、市府委市中心區設計委員名建築師董大酉氏爲監督人、並訂定於明年七月前完工、俾下屆全運會、卽在該塲舉行、</p>
<h3>將由市長親自奠基</h3>
<p>市府興建規模宏偉之體育塲、意義殊爲重大、故俟該塲地基砌成後、决將舉行一隆重之奠基禮、並將由吳市長親自奠基、該塲地點係在市中心公園、故開建後、該園大部份將削平改造該塲先造部份爲（一）田徑塲、（二）體育館、（三）游泳池、續造部份爲網球塲、棒球塲、明年正式落成後、當可睥睨遠東、</p>
<h3>願望與體協會合作</h3>
<p>據市當局談、此次市政府籌集經費建造體育塲意義殊大、一方爲本提倡體育、健强市民體格之宗旨、同時亦爲輔助大上海建設之繁榮、故體育塲完成後、極盼體育界之共同合作俾收提倡體育之實效、蓋該塲不但設備爲全國之冠、照市中心區地方寬闊、空氣淸潔、極宜於運動之塲合、現市府正積極開發交通、俾市政得確實利用、最近全國體育恊會之運動塲、因地主收回塲地頗受相當影響、市當局甚希望體恊會將來能共同合作、使本市之體育事業、在一種新的環境下、獲得更充分之發展、而市中心區之繁榮、亦借得莫大之助力云、又關於體育恊進會將來與市立體育塲進行合作問題據記者探悉、聞該會亦頗有此意、蓋大體育塲之設備完全、對該會殊有便利、惟以地點稍遠、故尙須加以考慮、但不久之將來、雙方正式實行合作、而共同負發展體育之責、使本市之體育界放異彩、或僅爲時間問題云、</p>
<h3>日菲非法解散遠運　我國將向會員國聲明　致世界委員會之宣言卽將着手　現仍籌措經費彌補遠運之不敷</h3>
<p>日菲之以非法手段解散歷史攸久之遠東運動大會、其荒謬行爲、匪祗我國同胞深致憤慨卽國際間之輿論、亦多不滿、我國對於今後之方針、已由體育當局一再闡明、記者昨又向體育恊進會沈嗣良君、叩詢該會致世界運動委員會之聲明書内容、茲特將各情分錄如次、</p>
<h3>再致聲明力闡非法</h3>
<p>據沈氏談、日菲此種狼狽爲奸之非法手段、絶無價値、而菲列濱體育委員會竟又簽字通過、則日人之甘言誘惑、及國際之利害關係、均露骨無遺、我當局所提送世界運動委員會之聲明書、現正在計劃着手、該項問題絶非咄嗟可辨、在該聲明書之前、擬先草繕否認非法解散之宣言分送各會員國鄭重聲明、保全會員人格、不容奸小搬弄朦蔽云云、</p>
<h3>籌措經費以補不敷</h3>
<p>記者並探悉我國出席此次遠運之經費、先後共籌得七萬餘元、開支方面、雖力事撙節但尙有捉襟見肘之苦、總結此行賬目、共用去八萬餘元、其不敷之數、均由運動員墊支、須設法彌償、故現仍擬向各界捐助若干、兼之恊進會之遷移部署、在在需費、故籌欵尤刻不容緩云、</p>
<h3>公開手球單打决賽　朱寬對察卡連　今日下午五時在西靑</h3>
<p>第一屆全滬公開手球雙打錦標、已於日前由中靑健將朱寬洪玉魁所得、單打錦標則將於今日下午五時半、仍在西靑球塲决賽、獲得决賽權者、爲朱寬與西人察卡連、兩雄相遇、定有一番大戰、在本屆比賽中、朱自始至終、屢戰屢捷、且曾一度擊敗察氏、故此屆錦標十九在朱掌握、至於前曾誤排朱與波愛塞立之秩序、業經西靑取消、蓋波從未獲得與朱較量之資格也、今日之戰、如朱仍勝、則錦標卽爲其得、倘不幸而敗則尙需最後之决賽、以解决本屆錦標云、</p>
<h3>萬國運動會　改十月中舉行</h3>
<p>全國體育恊進會主辦之本年上海萬國田徑賽運動會、本擬定春季舉行、旋因遠運會衝突、未能實現、迄今已屆炎夏、氣候過熱、不適宜此項運動、恊進會已决定上半年不再舉行、預定擬仍照去年會期、在十月中舉行云、</p>

<h3>局長致詞</h3>
<p>潘局長致詢略謂、今日敎師節、關於小學一部份希望的話、已在尙文小學的集會中說過、現在關於希望中學及中學以上之學校敎師貢獻一些意見、目前有人說小學生比中學生好、中學生比大學生好、彷彿大學敎員不如中學敎員盡職、中學敎員不如小學敎員盡職、其實不盡然、我們相信敎小學生比敎中學生容易、不是在課程上之高低、而是在學生年齡之不同、與社會的環境關係、小學生年齡在十三四歲以下、易受敎師指導全接觸的環境小、中學生年齡、正是生理心理劇烈變化的時期、其對外的接觸與活動比較廣大、容易傳染不良的影響、敎師無論大中小學同負訓練國民復興民族之責任、惟中學敎師比小學敎師難、故期望於中學敎師者更爲迫切、中學敎師必須眼光放大、把中學生完全在敎師領導之下、以得正當之敎育、敎育的意義、不僅是敎書、是敎人、敎學生怎樣做人、敎學生讀書不過是敎人工作之一部份而已、中學校中無論什麽敎師都負有此敎人之責任、過去許多敎師祗管敎自己的課程、這是錯誤、希望大家改正此風氣、其次敎師</p>
<p>應感化學生覺悟起來有服務社會的精神、最近蔣委員長電各省市敎育當局、利用學生假期、實際服務社會、卽是此意、希望各位以不怕困難的精神、領導學生去做、如减少文盲工作、必須政府與人民通力合作、敎師與學生全體動員才有效力云、</p>
<h3>通過提案</h3>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>只有幹纔是條生路</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近我國對外貿易的入超，年多一年，影響於國家財富，社會經濟，國民生計很大。挽救的方策，一致以服用國貨爲根本問題。所以去年公定爲「國貨年，」今年又公定爲「婦女國貨年，」希望引起男女國民一致的注意，定名者的用意很深，用心很苦，而對於一般實心實力奔走呼號從事國貨運動的士女，我們不能不表示萬分的敬佩。可是這樣以後，國貨就從此發達嗎？入超便從此改爲出超嗎？那是决沒有這樣容易。我們不要抱着什麽奢望，也不要存着什麽悲觀，我們做一分是一分，做總比不做的好。須知國貨的不發達，原因很多，倘使沒有把許多原因設法解决，提倡國貨雖不敢說不易收效，但多少總覺得事倍功半。大公報最近論到國貨問題，有幾句很精闢的話：</p>
<p>中國今日，提倡國産國貨，乃一死活問題。與過去二十年來，緩急大有不同。試問海關入超，每年六七萬萬元以上，民富幾何？不破産何待？三五年，最大十年，國民經濟，將整個不可收拾。</p>
<p>而救濟之道，奬勵出口難，流通國内易，蓋後者求已，而前者求人。在世界經濟蕭條關稅奇高之今日，增加出口，談何容易？亦惟有先暢通國内貿易，使國貨盛行，只此一點，是中國活路，且以政治之力，優能爲之。此而不爲，與坐待亡國等，無可爲之容恕者也。</p>
<p>中國提倡國貨，已不下二十年，但徴諸實際，則提倡其名，摧殘其實。今日數萬種之國産，乃在種種摧殘下掙扎生存而來。其能陳列大會，入於同胞眼簾，已不知曾費出幾許血與淚之代價者也。</p>
<p>我讀了這篇文字，大大的感動不置，認爲在此情形之下，我們的血沒有冷，心沒有死，只有實心實力，來從事國貨救國運動。纔是一條活路。可是我們要知道，從事國貨運動的，是獃子是熱心人，不管以後的成效如何，我們只有拚命的苦幹，纔有一綫的希望。即如從事今年婦女國貨年運動而論，一般熱心的女士，熱烈的工作，拚命的苦幹，爲的是什麽？她們爲什麽不坐在家裏打打牌，出外看看影戲，而來幹這吃力不討好的工作，她們無非是良心未泯，熱血猶存。在這國人尙在如醉如夢，沒有普遍覺悟的時代，她們開會演說，總比不開會不演說好得多，她們宣傳提倡，總比不宣傳不提倡好得多。她們說得到，做得到，惟其她們信仰國貨，愛用國貨，纔出來勸人服用國貨，提倡國貨。在我看來，只覺得感激，只覺得佩服，只覺得眞心實力的從事國貨的人不多，只覺得婦女界中的獃子太少，熱心人太少。李浩然先生說：「假使無此數年的努力，入超殆更多於今日。提倡者正不必心灰氣沮，惟有再求發展以求最後之勝利而已。」這幾句話，可以代表社會上一般人的輿論。所以今年的婦女國貨年，卽使沒有多大成績，但是種因於此，一時的效果，或者隱而不顯，可是日久以後，燦爛的花，美滿的果，一定是可以預料得到的。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>値得注意的兩件東西！</h3>
<p>— 導凑</p>
<p>「洋貨傾銷」，「仇貨充斥」，幾成爲近今普遍的事實，不足爲怪；可是，在這個提倡國貨的年中，有兩件東西，頗有値得注意的必要，往往的給人們忽視了，事情雖小，關係却大，要曉得提倡國貨，服用國貨，須由小虞設想，要從小處着手，纔可事半而功倍，現在不妨將値得注意的兩件東西，分述如后：　　（一）無綫電收音機：這件東西。本不是生活上必需的一種消遣品，目下在各大都市中，差不多成爲人皆有之的現象，觸目都是，商店用以號召顧客，住戶用以娛樂家庭，考其來源，惟有舶來是求！歐美出品，價格較昻，非百數十金不能購置；詎最近更有仇貨傾銷賤賣，售價每具僅値二三十金，購買者幾趨之若鶩，成爲平民化，於是銷路日增，利權的外溢，也隨着××的輪船而東渡，這筆數目，當然也不在少數！我極希望愛護國貨提倡國貨······的人們，從速擯除去購置的念頭，因爲這件東西，並不十分需要，能省則省，可免則免，庶可爲國貨謀點出路，替國家保點原氣！</p>
<p>（二）兒童玩具：兒童玩具，在以前悉賴舶來，近幾年，幸有國人設廠製造，如玩具廠，賽璐珞廠等是；出品日漸精良，銷路尙屬差强人意，可在這仇貨充斥的當兒，仍有不少的仇貨在傾軋着，如馬路邊上零售的橡皮什品，賽璐珞玩具等，統計這項損失，全年全國扯算起來，亦是驚人，奚止恒河沙數？不過，在孩提的兒童，思想本易變遷，好奇心非常之重，要什麽？買什麽？無所不用其驕，此時，就要希冀爲良母者，拿定「不用」「不買」的主義，並指引其國貨仇貨的辨别，告知其購買仇貨的利害關係，庶可養成小弟弟小妹妹們的愛用國貨的基本觀念與習慣，旣愛國，又愛子，豈不是一舉數得嗎？</p>
<h3>國貨和妓女</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「妓女」這一種人，大家都認爲是卑鄙的，低下的，「國貨」這一個名字，大家都知道是高尙的，光榮的，可是，現在我却把「國貨和妓女」聯在一起，來做本文的題目，豈不是提高妓女的聲價，血汚辱國貨的尊嚴嗎？閱者諸君，請聽我道來，便是端的：</p>
<p>我認爲身穿國貨，是一件最高尙最光榮的事，換一句話說：滿身洋貨，以致於滿身劣貨，都是一件最恥辱不過的事，一個規規矩矩，正正經經的人，决不肯穿洋貨而屏棄國貨，同時，一個身價低微，不務正經的人，他也决不肯穿十足道地的國貨的，我們看馬路上拉客的妓女，以及其他操皮肉生涯者的身上，那個不是十足的身穿洋貨呢？這種人，我們只要稍微一看，便可知道她不是正經人，規矩人，這是一個很簡單的道理，大家都能明白的。</p>
<p>所以，在這婦女國貨年之中，我却有一個主張，這個主張，便是改變一下大衆的心理，大家都有一個「穿洋貨的女子是妓女」的觀念，是最卑鄙恥辱的事，這樣一來，我想：一定有許多女子，來摒棄洋貨而服用國貨，同時，我們更可以用名譽奬勵的方法，來奬勵服用國貨的女子，認爲是一個「時代的婦女」，最最光榮的一仲事，不過，這件工作，最好用敎育的方法，先從學校做起，然後逐漸的推展開來，也是婦女國貨年中，各學校應做的工作之一，全國各學校，都能這樣做去，婦女國貨年的成績，雖不能立卽發現偉人的功效，但是至少替今後的國貨推銷，種下一粒良好的種子呢？關於前者，「穿洋貨的女子是妓女」的心理改革，不僅可以使一般不是妓女的婦女，爲保持身價起見，不去服有洋貨，同時，就是一般眞正操皮肉生涯的妓女，一定也要提高她的身價，來改用國貨哩，這樣看來，「國貨與妓女」，不是也能聯帶的關係嗎？</p>

<h3>國貨在開封　丨西北流動展覽第一聲丨</h3>
<p>— 趙秉仁</p>
<p>在中華國貨産銷合作恊會領導下的國貨西北流動展覽團，經二月之籌備，集合上海最著名的國貨工廠二十一家，於五月二十日由記者率領各廠代表八十餘人，開始向我們第一展覽地丨開封進發。因爲此行與開發西北及推行國貨均有重大關繫，意義之深遠，自比普通展覽會更進一層，參加各廠固一致的具着遠大眼光和犧牲精神，卽各代表也都有不辭艱苦的决心，這誠然是國貨界的創舉，也正是國貨界前進的表徴。全團於二十一日抵汴，在河南省政府建設廳曁開封商會的恊助之下，盛大的開封展覽會就於二十七日宣告開幕了。</p>
<p>國貨展覽會在開封是一件使人興奮的事，這許是民十七展覽以後多年未曾舉行的緣故，開幕前稍一宣傳，就到處聽見民衆們相互傳告「展覽會要來了」的聲浪，展覽會塲在共和街國貨市塲，房屋爲八卦式，原有分間裝修，非常適用，這次各廠佈置展覽物品，就大都因地製宜，充分利用了這市塲内原有的一切設備。會塲大門搭着高大彩樓，雄巍莊嚴，塲内進出口分搭較小彩樓，美麗精緻，各廠的塲位分配是中華琺瑯廠和家庭工業社分居進口兩邊，再進卽爲五和，華成，大中華，正泰，三友，華昌，中國化工，中國國貨，中華針織，西湖，美亞，鴻新，新亞，光華，華福，泰康，達隆，諸家，而以天廚味精廠及虎標永安堂殿其後。各廠陳列布置，各有獨到之處，尤以美亞家庭中華琺瑯三家爲出色，開幕前一夕各廠已布置竣事，全團人員就在興高采烈的情緒下等待着開幕日的來臨。</p>
<p>展覽會開幕日照例先舉行開幕典禮，倒是非常盛大，來賓擠滿了典禮會塲所在的一個戲院，省府主席各廳廳長黨務特派員以及紳學領袖都來出席，而且都有詳明透徹的演說，一時在塲提倡國貨空氣特别緊張，使人興奮，使人歡欣。典禮完成，展覽會塲隨卽開放，民衆們丨丨男的女的老的少的丨丨如潮湧一般進入會塲，各廠櫃前全擠滿了人，看貨·問價，因爲語言的稍有隔閡，各廠人員都格外小心地應付，自朝至晚，會塲始終被擠得水洩不通，各類國貨爲參觀者購去試用的也着實不在少數，尤以中華琺瑯廠的出品爲最受人歡迎，是日萬千來會民衆，幾乎無人不手執中華搪瓷一提而去，其餘美亞綢緞五和汗衫也大爲參觀者所樂於購用，蓋價廉物美之國貨，正是開封民衆所需要的呵！</p>
<p>國貨在開封必然地將有一個極大底發展，因爲開封的政府是提倡國貨的，而同時開封的民衆又是愛用國貨的。</p>
<h3>刋行夏令國貨用品專號啟事</h3>
<p>本刋擬於六月二十一日刋行夏令國貨用品專號，希望各工廠以夏令用品特長之點，分别見告，讀者如有對於國貨工廠出品上之批評，或改進意見，或特殊貢獻，使購用者製造者交受其益，亦極歡迎。惟每篇以二三百字簡短實際爲合，跡近宣傳或過涉空泛者，一槪不錄。</p>
<p>本刊徴文揭曉（續）</p>
<h3>我之服用國貨經騐談</h3>
<p>— 李霞女士</p>
<p>我得忠實地說，在學校裏像我這樣堅毅的人，女學生中只有我一人，我在去年「國貨年」裏，就堅决的下定了一個「三不」的主張，就是一不用洋貨，二不嫁洋少爺，三不與用洋貨的人交友。直到今年改了「婦女國貨年」，格外增加了我的决心。當然，在這短時期中，在我是沒有什麽經騐可談，不過隨便的寫一些事實，以表示我對於「國貨運動」的責任而已。</p>
<p>我本來是個鄕村女子，那時純粹的穿着母親親手織成的土布，後來爲着我升學的緣故，就搬到城裏住，當然，城市本來像一個洋化鍋，任何人踏入總得愛些影響，於是，我的媽媽不再自己織布了，我們一家的服用，漸漸地洋化起來，竟不知不覺的做了洋貨的推銷員。在這時我深深的覺着這種行動是不可恕的罪惡，然而爲着環境的關係，只是順着他們去做。去年，突然給邵爽秋博士熱烈地登高一呼，提倡土貨救國，使我頓觸悲懷，想起自己竟做了國貨界的蝥賊，於是堅决的加入了邵博士所組織的念二社，誓死服用國貨，馮着我的熱血，竭力地去鼓吹，把以前穿着的土布衣，重穿着起來。直到現在，我覺得一個人的服用國貨問題，完全要靠看自己的堅毅的决心，切切實實的做去，信口喊着服用國貨的調兒，是决不會有什麽效騐的。</p>
<h3>我之服用國貨經騐談</h3>
<p>— 陳美玉女士</p>
<p>中國人應服用中華國貨，是乃金科玉律。在「婦女國貨年」，女學生應以身作則，努力提倡服用國貨，更屬天經地義。</p>
<p>但自國人提倡服用國貨以來，少數唯利是圖之商人，常有將外貨冒充國貨出售；甚至亦有將仇貨改頭換面，藉以魚目混珠者，作者亦已受愚多次矣。</p>
<p>迨專售國貨商塲國貨公司出現，於是作者購用日常用品，必往國貨商塲國貨公司採辦，誠以國貨商塲决無混售外貨或仇貨之弊也。</p>
<p>又以同一日常用物，國貨出品不一而足，究以何種最適合吾人需要？以何種貨色與物價最屬相稱？則非多方探問並加以研究不爲功。故作者同學間嘗有爲一國貨牙膏肥皂之微，互相討論研究至數週之久，始商定購用之標凖者。</p>
<p>且以吾國工業幼稚，各種化學原料非常缺乏。現在市上通行之國貨，其原料仍多取自舶來，僅配合及製造之人工爲國人耳。是以吾輩購用國貨，並須注意其貨物成分之來源，務必選用純屬國貨及包含外國材料最少者，以符吾人服用國貨本旨。</p>
<p>依據作者服用國貨經騐，僅向工商界貢獻三事焉：</p>
<p>（一）希望各業領袖積極在各地組設國貨公司，以便愛用國貨者採購。在國貨公司未普遍設立前，盼各業能各闢國貨部，以利顧者。</p>
<p>（二）希望各工廠製造用品時，竭力設法减少採用外國材料。並盼將採用外國及本國材料成數詳細註明，使購者知所選擇。</p>
<p>（三）希望各工廠能將每一出品之用法及功效據實說明，勿作欺人之談。定價務求克己，但亦不可過於低廉，失人信仰。</p>

<h3>夏令時装擡閣提燈大會觀光記</h3>
<p>— 丁杏</p>
<p>一天，中國國貨公司一位朋友這様告訴我：「報告你一個從未聽見過的好消息，我們公司裏，自六月一日起，和美亞織綢廠聯合舉行夏令時装擡閣提燈大會，裏面有少女時装，故事燈彩，廣告走燈······等」，我聽了歡喜的問：「在三樓還是四樓？」他說：「不不，就在二樓商塲，環行出着，」我道：「這眞是空古創聞，祗聽見人家說，螺螄壳裏做道塲，從末聽見過公司裏可以出大會，」他說··「奇就奇這一點。」</p>
<p>一陣悠揚的樂聲，把人聲鎭静了下來,大會的隊伍，就漸漸的由該公司的棧房移出，大約有半小時的辰光罷，纔看完了它的全隊。</p>
<p>該會的主旨，在宣揚國産夏令的衣料的優美，夏令時装，要怎樣纔能適合女人的心性，這一次出演的服装，有：「大禮服」「常服」「晚宴服」「宴會服」「園遊服」「家庭服」「海濱服」「運動服」「睡眠服」······等数十種，材料是美亞出品的：「紅螺繪」「鳳儀紗」「二喬縐」「羅曼縐」「雙縐」「凝香綃」「印花喬其紗」「格子喬其紗」「條子喬其紗」「糺縵縐」······等，在這許多不同的時裝和衣料，却有現成的幾句話來評定：「適合身材」「長短合度」「飄拂有致」「妙絶塵寰」據說，承製這些時裝的，是中國國貨公司的新裝部。</p>
<p>還有其他的燈彩，可分：「擡閣」「　燈」「物燈三種，擡閣有：「木蘭從軍」「黛玉葬花」「寳蟾送酒」「明妃出塞」「貂蟬拜月」······等，「盞燈」有「百花」「繡球」「靈龍」「翔鳳」······等，物燈有：「大鵝」「立鶴」······等。</p>
<p>綜計這次的觀衆，四日内約有數萬人，可知道在許女觀衆，祇少得到一些的觀念，是：「知道中國貨，也有這樣好的夏令衣料，好做合式的時裝。」我想，中國國貨公司此舉，不是沒有價値的了。</p>
<h3>防疫與國貨</h3>
<p>— 麗妮</p>
<p>夏天又來了！暴日射出來熱烈的火焰，各種毒蟲毒菌也都乘機發動：「白晝有武裝的蒼蠅，帶領着大批毒菌，隨意擾亂；夜晚有臭蟲蚊蟲，利用黑暗，吮人血液：還有潛伏在各處傳染瘟疫的病菌，如果不及早設法消除，那麽將來的禍害眞是不堪設想！</p>
<p>我們知道溝頭，壁角，垃圾堆，便所······等等汚濕的地方，就是毒蟲毒菌集合的大本營，我們唯一防禦的辦法，就是使用國貨「亞林防疫臭水，」澆入牠們的大本營，殺滅一切的毒蟲毒菌！這種斬草除根的辦法，可以使我們平安渡過這可怕的夏天。</p>
<p>國貨「亞林防疫臭水」，是五洲大藥房的精製品，質料濃，藥力足，已得歷年全國人們和各衛生機關的嘉許：所以無論公衆的地方，和大小的家庭，要謀生命上的安寗，不能不備國貨「亞林臭水」澆洒。</p>
<h3>勢不兩立</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>今有甲乙二人，仇恨很深。有了甲，便沒有了乙。有了乙，便沒有了甲。這就是『勢不兩立』。</p>
<p>我覺得如今的『國貨』與『洋貨』，也好比甲乙二人，積下了『勢不兩立』的仇恨一樣！有了『國貨』，便沒有了『洋貨』。有了『洋貨』，便沒有了『國貨』。換句話說：就是『國貨』暢銷了，『洋貨』便可絶跡。要是『洋貨』暢銷了，『國貨』便無出路！</p>
<p>這樣看來，『國貨』與『洋貨』，旣已『勢不兩立』。那麽，我們應該努力提倡『國貨』，快快打倒『洋貨』。否則，『洋貨』不打倒，『國貨』前途的危機，不堪設想！</p>

<h3>石與水</h3>
<p>— 玄明</p>
<p>如果國家的基礎是建築在磐石上，則一切内憂外患都可以當作蜻蜓，蜻蜓撼石柱，不關痛癢的，如果這基礎像紅樓夢裏的女孩兒一般，「是水做的」！則不但蜻蜓，就是一隻小蚊子，也可以將其推動了。</p>
<p>甚矣夫！擾亂世界的人之多也。人類的情感大多是共通的，貪生畏死，欺善怕惡，但大半相信鬼神。善人少而不善人多，好光明者少而好黑暗者多，是東西兩半球一致的。丨丨試舉一近事爲例吧，德國警察長衛佐，最近極力懲罰吉卜西婦女，並已懸令拿辦一切術士，方士，星相家了。</p>
<p>這就是石柱堅固的佐證！</p>
<p>但看中國的迷信怎樣呢？在朝的密宗之類且不說，只看民間的迷信就够巧了。根據的是一二「洗寃錄」裏的無稽之談，滴血可以騐父子，於是乎助長了風水之說；因爲幾個文學家昔日誇張身世，歷來的皇帝用神道設敎駕馭奴才，至今苦信着看相，推八字，最新還有「科學靈乩」。易經明明是一部哲學書，但至今作了「文王神課」的敎本：卜易給宋儒駡倒了。然而那作用實在高過於敎育部審定的數學書。只看街道墻壁上所貼的，報章上所登的，只聽街頭巷尾所談的，便知道中國人的精神生活在什麽世紀裏！</p>
<p>這就不見得不是水做的中國。</p>
<p>聽說從前有「金剛禪」之類，有所謂道法，呼風喚雨，點石成金，敎義的根據是金剛經，但是這麽斷句的：「是法！平等無，有高下」，這就不但使和尙冷齒，便是讀書人也搖頭。然而這爲害地方，擾亂百姓，當時是不小的。</p>
<p>迷信，無論大小，是社會上的膿瘡！將風水先生，算命先生，論相的相士，用飛機運到西北開墾去；將和尙道士，一齊派往西藏殖邊，同時護送班禪回籍，然後方可談國民，民國之類······</p>
<h3>窰坑雜寫人之一</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>住過吉林的人，怕沒有人不知道窰坑的吧？窰坑是什麽呢？是從前燒窰時掘土遺剩下來的大土坑。在吉林，一共有三個窰坑，全是在東關，一個在新開門外大馬路旁日本領事館的對面，其餘兩個在大東門外朝陽街的兩旁。</p>
<p>窰坑的面積是很大的，這可以想見從前建造吉林城時，用去了多少的磚瓦，到如今，日久年深，坑裏面長出很高大的樹木來。</p>
<p>窰坑低下地平面去，頂少也有一丈開外，最低的地方，距離地面都有一丈八九尺的。這樣的大坑，說起來應該荒在那裏空着了，實際却不然，反倒是住了很多的人家。不過，全不是富裕的住民，大槪不是拉洋車爲業的，就是小槓工人丨丨一些賣苦力的人們，他們住在這裏，是因爲房錢比地面上的房子便宜得多。</p>
<p>入了夏季，一遇到連雨天，坑裏面就積存一片一片的水塘，但總是淹不到坑裏的房屋的，因爲房舍的基地，比積水地方都高出去二三尺以上。這倒不是什麽討厭的事情，最使一般住在窰坑裏的人們不快的，同時又是無法除掉的，那就是從地面上混着雨水傾瀉到坑裏的髒水，這些髒水，宛如看到了窰坑的風水很好，選爲葬身的宿地似的，一有機會，總那麽爭先恐後地奔流過來，這就帶來了濃重的腥臊惡臭的氣息，游划着，發射着，再也不散到别的地方去。</p>
<p>說到氣候，窰坑裏和地平面上也有很大的差别，譬如夏天，坑裹面就比地平面上熱得很厲害，因爲凉風先生輕易不肯光顧到這樣低下卑濕的地方。而入冬之後。坑壁的凍地和積水結成的堅冰吸蝕着，氣候又比地平面上加倍冷。</p>
<p>有錢不住窰坑房，</p>
<p>冬不暖，</p>
<p>夏不凉。</p>
<p>這是最能道出窰坑氣候的一首短歌。</p>
<p>九一八事變以後，東北鄕村戰亂頻興，人民無法安居生活，於是稍有資産的人，一般小資産階級丨丨小地主們丨丨都避到城市裏來寄居了，窮人窠一般的窰坑平添了很多鄕間的土紳與地主。至於窰坑裏的房價，聽說現在也比從前增貴了兩三倍。</p>
<h3>民丨警丨匪</h3>
<p>— 迫迂</p>
<p>報上載着：膠澳區鹽潮擴大，搶鹽民衆約四五百人，婦孺均有。哿（五月二十日）夜鹽警武力制止，捕大批婦孺，壯丁逃散，馬（二十一日）夜鹽警復用武力：搶鹽民衆還擊，傷鹽警一，斃民衆三，捕一解局。據供：辛安集一帶農民，特由大珠山邀劉桂堂殘匪三十餘人，恊同農民搶鹽，遇警由匪抵抗。搶鹽一筐，酬匪一角云。靑市稅警區長馬小籙，急帶警二十名，梗（二十三日）赴膠縣調集各分區鹽警二百餘名，並邀請膠縣派民團百餘名，周縣長梗（二十三日）抵紅石崖，向辛安集搜剿。</p>
<p>我初讀之下，百思不得其解。我們只知道：警是保護民而匪是害民的。現在，則公然在報上，可以讀到民與警戰，而求於匪的紀載了。</p>
<p>據父老所傳，報紙所刋，歷史所載，匪也者，殺人放火，殘忍橫暴之流也，而今則與農民合作，如此奇事，雖摩登仕女聞之，亦恐將擊案三歎矣。</p>
<p>要了解這奇異事件，必須解釋一番：第一是搶鹽的原因，那是非常簡單的，上海某晚報已經在總題上說得很明白：「鹽稅太重不堪淡食」。至於鹽稅究竟重到如何？遠地的我們，似乎不能知道詳細，但是根據「搶鹽」筐酬匪一角」的紀載，則鹽稅超過此數若干倍，不難想見。蓋如果相差無幾，則老實的農民，幼弱的婦孺，誰肯走險？</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>「搶」，本來是以力突擊而强取之謂。七八强盜搶一富家，事先尙有組織，而况現在是四五百徒手人民去搶有槍械的官所。農民雖愚，也何至帶「大批婦孺」以求死也？所以我恐怕，二十日夜四五百人去官所是以　　哭哭而激起「鹽警武力制止」的（？），結果是跑不動的婦孺，都被捕去了。這樣，第二天的「鹽警復用武力，搶鹽民衆還擊。」其中情理，在歷次學生請願事件中，都可以想像得到。鹽營的武力是什麽？民衆的還擊又是什麽？所以民衆三人的斃了，而鹽警似乎也不得不說傷了一個的。於是，在張	效帥慣的「斃」字之下，農民乃往求有槍的匪之助了。</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>此事發生在山東，山東主席韓復榘素有靑天大老爺之稱，手下專打不平之俠客如雲，對此事未聞有「聞哭聲而到，·········」之事，殊令人百思不得解。</p>
<p>財政會議之廢除苛捐雜稅之議案，是一致通過了。如果這權力不及於「周縣長梗抵紅石崖」，那末，打一個電報呼籲一下也好，吧！（一九三四，五，二九。）</p>
<h3>參觀藝風畫展小記</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>藝風社組織的第一屆全國畫展，已於三日下午開幕，地點在上海法租界愛麥虞限路中華學藝社。一走進門，就去買了一本「藝風」專號；翻開來看看，不但有一百多幅的圖片，四萬字左右的論文，而且連目錄，出品人肖像都訂在一處。目錄上作品到有七百四十七點；據孫福熙君（負責人之一）說：目錄上版後又收到一百多點，總共九百多點。</p>
<p>藝風社，以私人的集團，居然能使南京，北平，上海，杭州，蘇州，武昌，厦門，廣州······等處，都有出品：範圍不可說不廣。大槪其它畫展，均立定一個範圍：或是一個學校，或是一個團體，推至一個畫派；除了與此學校，此團體，此畫派有關係者的作品外，别方面的作品就不徴求。藝風畫展却不然：它第一掃除門戶之見。它以爲一個學者當然應該有一中心思想，如果有人向這思想表示同情固然是很好，卽不然，也不必强人同他一樣。再推開講，就整個社會立塲，就國家文化立塲說，所需要的不僅是一個學校，一個團體，一個畫派；乃是多數的學校，多數的團體，多數的畫派。這見解是對的。</p>
<p>藝風畫展的出品數量旣然是這樣的大，再它的内容，畫展中的四位女畫家：方君璧，潘玉良，孫多慈，史人宇，已有慧茵君在二日的大晚報「火炬」上評論過，我私入對於四位的感想正與慧茵君相同，所以不再論列了。杭州藝專同人林風眠，蔡威廉，李朴園，吳大羽，方幹民，雷圭元，葉雲，以及雕刻家劉開渠等有一共同的趨向，便是「力的表現」；「藝風」特刋裏，李朴園君作有一篇「杭州藝專同仁之介紹」，可以參考。南京中大藝術系西畫組徐悲鴻，潘玉良，顧了然，李竹子，李毅士，陳之佛，張書旂等，皆陳有力作多幅，精采異常。上海新華藝專的汪亞塵，吳恒勤，周碧初，楊秀濤等，亦以已臻上境的作品參與展覽。蘇州美專吳子深之國畫，顔文樑之風景，黃覺寺之西畫，各樹一幟。白社同人諸聞韻，吳茀之，潘天授，張書旂，張振鐸，亦紛紛參加。王祺，張聿光，經亭頤等，亦皆樂於以手筆出展。高奇峯氏遺作一幅，彌覺可貴。郎魯遜陳有雕像數件；聞有近作一件，不幸於製模時失手跌碎云。</p>
<h3>蕭伯納上當記</h3>
<p>— 嘉謨</p>
<p>英國大文豪蕭伯納，也誰知道他是一個頭號的幽默家，專門尋人家開玩笑的。誰想到他最近却也上了人家一次當。這是最近在英國Ｄｅｔｒｏｉｔ地方發生的事。　　最近有一個美國人，名呌麥唐納（Ｋｅｎｎｅｔｈ　Ｒ·ＭａｃＤｏｎｅｌｄ）的去找他，據他說是傾慕蕭伯納的大名，要請他寫一本親筆的著作：報酬的條件是每個字美金一元。在蕭伯納老頭兒看來，這報酬並不優厚，而且又要親自動筆，這在他是認爲不容易的事，所以當初就沒有答應，但還當麥唐納是一個出版家，所以也相當的敷衍他一番。</p>
<p>幾天之後，麥唐納寄給蕭伯納一封信，信裏說，他現在正在經理一種，助消化的藥丸，他以爲如能借蕭伯納的親筆書和他的大名作爲商標，一定可以銷路暢旺。他以爲利用蕭伯納的名字是沒有不可以的。前天所提出的每字一元的酬勞，蕭先生如果認爲太少，大家還儘有商量的餘地云云。</p>
<p>這眞是「什麽話」了。蕭伯納接信後大不快活，認爲已經離開幽默的立塲而近於侮辱了。於是便去信回絶麥唐納，信裏很强硬地說：</p>
<p>「······如果你敢把我的名字那麽用法，我一定要盡我的力量用法律和你周旋。你要當心······」</p>
<p>這樣一來，總算以一個釘子給那個無禮的商人去碰了。誰知那個麥唐納接信後，喜不自勝，他把蕭老頭子的原信視若拱璧的保存起來。因爲他的希望已經如願以償了。他的希望就是得到蕭伯納的潦草的簽名式：</p>
<p>「Ｆａｉｔｈｆｕｌｌｙ　Ｇ·　Ｂｅｒｎａｒｄ　Ｓｈａｗ」</p>
<p>因爲在平時要得到蕭伯納的親筆簽名是很不容易的。這一次把他激得生氣了，他只好自己動筆回信去出出這口氣的。於是，蕭老頭子就上了一次當了。</p>
<h3>火災（三）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>「呸！他，他曉得什麽生意！只靠着好靠山罷了。爲了他父親的面上，新加坡的廣隆號這兩年給他借過了幾萬塊，不然的話，老早應該關掉了。丨丨譬如，一個月前，樹膠忽然漲了二角錢的價，他像拾得了寳貝般，便搶着買。我是看中這種行情是沒有好市價的，這抬高的價格當有别的一時原故罷？所以，他搶着買便讓他買好了，我偏不買。結果怎樣？一帮貨寄到新加坡去。價格跌了，一下子便輸了千多塊。你想，在這種市情之下，千多塊錢怎樣撈回來？白輸掉罷了！我却一文都沒掉。哼，曉得做什麽生意！」我這位親戚，顯出他是一位善於經營的老乎，很有得色般說，並且鄙視着那隔鄰第三間的幼穉的同業。</p>
<p>福和號和羣興號是互相吃着醋的，這已是有多年的歷史了。福和有的是雄厚的資本，而羣興却産生了人才。丨我的這位經理姑丈爺便是商界的有名人物哩！丨丨所以歷來便是你爭我鬥，互相爭奪着主顧。這一邊一賺到了錢，那一邊便眼紅；那一邊失利了，這一邊却拍手呌好，你如果在他們面前談着對方的時候，他們是是祇會說自己的長處，而揭發着敵人的破綻的。</p>
<p>「現在做生意也太費苦心了。」我輕輕地隨口說，心裏很有點茫然之感。</p>
<p>「對咯。」接着他打了個呵欠。眉心縐着，像有一椿事掛在心頭般。我覺悟着，說：</p>
<p>「姑丈，你剛才是不是從晝寢裏給我擾起來？我記得姑丈是有晝寢的習慣的，請便吧！打擾你，眞當心不起了！」</p>
<p>「那倒不是，這幾天，因爲數目籌劃的事情，把晝寢取消。不過剛才倒有一椿事，和阿梅（那是我的姑丈的一位助理，也是一位很會打算盤的人。）商酌着。那末，不陪了，反正是自已的親感，不相干的。並且我可以派人去通知你的舊友們，說你來了，大家可以談一下，叙叙十年來的闊别。」</p>
<p>「是，請便！自己人，不要客氣。我也可以到那邊坐坐去的。」</p>
<p>於是，這位有謀略的商人是踱着慢步出去了。當他出去的時候，我看他的顔色是非常莊重眉心緊縐着，我想他的心裏必有一件重大的事情牽掛着。這種態度，十年前是不會看到的。</p>

<h3>銀錢業務日趨淸淡</h3>
<p>銀錢業自四底以來、每日市况、日趨淸淡、至最近而更甚、市塲中各種交易雖不絶端閑暇、然大都均屬應景而已、洋拆市價、早午兩市均開九分、仍與前日同、劃頭交易仍放欵爲難、膨脹程度未能稍戢、致感頭寸充斥、始終白劃無加水、拆票交易、早市轉賬及新交易四百二十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖九十餘萬、新做出八十餘萬、銀行收解、依然日趨退化、計外商銀行收解票欵一百三十餘萬、外匯結欵一百二十餘萬、各種貨滙墊押雜欵收解二百八十餘萬、出倉六十萬、華商銀行收解票欵二百二十餘萬、關稅欵五十餘萬、電滙欵六十餘萬、各種貨滙墊押雜欵收解三百九十餘萬、進倉二十萬、日商銀行收解票欵一百七十餘萬、各權貨滙墊押雜欵收解三百零數萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千四百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百四十餘萬、收現六七十萬、鈔票收回九十餘萬、發出一百三十餘萬、各路滙欵七十餘萬、客路去胃二十萬、無來源、又票據交換所六日交換總數、銀元六百七十萬零三千一百五十元○○一分、内計銀元三百六十五萬五千九百二十一元九角、滙劃銀元三百零四萬七千二百二十八元一角一分、</p>
<h3>角幣跌風未戢　丨銅元續短二千文丨</h3>

<p>格未能起色、計江南小洋早午兩市、同爲八百三十四元、較前日又改小一元、早市交易六千五百角、午市無交易、廣東小洋早市開盤爲七百三十九元七角、較前日加長一元二角、旋以交易不旺、至午市收盤縮落一元四角、致結果較前日反小二角、做出交易早市七萬五千角、午市四萬五千角、銅元亦連續下跌、昨已跌至三百二十七千文、較前日續短二千文、交易數額三萬八千二百五十九串文、合代價洋一萬一千七百元、</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉徐徐而升</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈穩漲之勢、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲一元四角左右、坎拿大漲四分左右、故開價後、人心漸形俏利、但以實銷客帮、平靜如常、祇業外買戶以及銀錢業、仍有大批吸收、人心似乎俏利、惟各廠方面、卽陸續出檔、因此以後各盤、又復見平、但十一月份、則因外行吸收、遂爲抬住也、迨至下午開盤、初仍穩定、旋因廠家仍有抛售、人心轉疲、雖外行巨戶、依然吸進、惟純屬做心思惟質、究不能步步轟動、至業中人之心思冷淡、則以新麥年收甚佳、實銷方面、又因農村之不景氣、實在之購力、難以增進、所以買氣反愈見淡也、結果本月份祇較好一分、七月份好一分、八月份好一分二厘半、九月份好一分二厘半、十月份好一分七厘半、</p>
<h3>洋麥漲期麥隨昂</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈俏利之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲一元四角不等、坎拿大微好四分零、當開價時、業中人心思、依然平平、以新麥收獲、一部分正在收割、大部分約再一星期、均能全部收進、照目下情形、實均豐稔、人心之較卽爲此故、惟業外方面、則因美國麥産之歉收、將來終須高昂、故買氣仍盛、各盤市氣、遂爲帶起矣、結果本月份較大一分、七月份四分、八月份好二分、九月份好五分、十月份好三分、現小麥昨日新到七千多包、大部分爲火車陳麥、少數爲長江一帶之新小麥、市上未開、一部分由行直接配廠方、</p>
<h3>薄稻胃呆轉跌</h3>
<p>滬南昨日各帮來源五十餘號、（貨約七千五六百石、）其中晚稻較夥、占有三分之二、故客帮包胃轉懈、晚稻卽軟、計北洋帮共去靑角·松泗·練塘等貨僅千包左右、而兼零胃又淡、市價續修、各厚粳店胃淸寂、幸北洋包胃續動、蘇同貨二三百包、市色賴以轉定、惟南港早稻稍軟數分、杜洋尖去胃各異、貨亦優劣不等、陰變元因銷塲懈淡、市形帶疲、價隨貨參差一二角不等、</p>
<p>滬北昨日河下到船二十一二號、各貨去路日益呆滯、白元價小近角、白粳薄稻平定、羊杜埠尖疲數分、</p>
<h3>客秈到銷兩淡</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到銷兩淡、全日成交不到一千包、而到頭亦微、長江一路以搬運不劃、均在觀望中、江北及火車各路均祇零星小數拼凑而來、總計亦不到二千包、市上存底略有但貨主以目下産價已漲、此後正値靑黃不接之季令、預料銷區定有暢胃、故多數意在擯持不輕脫以待善價沽也、去戶目下尙在運裝前成各貨、意在撳小再辦、因此互相擯持、故交易雖微、市價反見站挺也、全日本街去機元機秈各一百包、閩省去機糙各三四百包、行情與前市相似、</p>
<h3>新蠶豆與菜籽均軟</h3>
<p>往年新貨登塲、必有一番搶新之舉、惟今庚購買力薄弱、無人　辦、頭批無所謂搶新、而三批</p>
<p>到後、軟綿之態畢露、所以市况不定、昨溫州蠶豆首先跌價、雖係無稅之貨、但較前兩盤之價、亦見跌落、計津帮成交五百餘包、價爲三元至二元九角、溫州菜籽亦見下降、聞做開無稅貨二百包、價爲三元九角二、閔行靑蠶續到五百餘包、身份仍潮軟、出口帮勉强辦裝、價開四元零五分至四元、行情亦跌二角、紅白蠶開原盤「四元」、但爲第二批新貨耳、</p>
<h3>大批芝蔴由漢來滬　丨待輪運往歐州丨</h3>
<p>近有由漢口運來芝蔴六千餘包、約計六百餘噸、在滬待輪、運往歐洲、該項巨量芝蔴、聞係日</p>

<h3>南北貨蘭花子新陳不接</h3>
<p>蘭花子近以銷路漸動、號貨雖屬普通莊、亦已開通行貨、昨亦告罄、現在所存者僅有最低之貨色焉、不合銷胃、故可銷之貨、竟告斷擋、地頭稍有存底、搜價要五十餘元、不能合划、一時暫無運申之望、然出新尙需時日、申漢兩地市價終必接近云、</p>
<h3>川榨菜開價又漲</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論浪漫和頽廢</h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>正是像古時羅馬古典主義末葉的情形一樣，一大半的靑年漸趨入於浪漫和頽廢二條路上去。浪漫和頽廢的差别，曾記得有一個哲學家說過：「浪漫是消極裏的積極，頽廢却是消極裏的消極。」</p>
<p>昔法國的魯梭，德國的司勒格爾，及英國的司各脫，他們都因爲現實待他們的不滿，而感覺到一切的生活都沒有活力，所以在他們的表示裏，産生出文學上的浪漫主義。同樣，靑年們所以會趨入於浪漫之途，也因爲感覺到四周環境的惡劣，不能有他們美麗的憧憬存在；這時，他們會批評社會是粗俗難耐，而自己的心田，不關有意識或無意識，都似乎不屑與噲爲伍。在這内心感覺到苦到苦悶的時候，産生出來的便是身心上的浪漫。在身方面，他們是絶對的亨樂，在心方面，便用種種的方法來麻醉自己的頭腦；他們超脫現實，而傾向到空想的美夢裏。</p>
<p>在他主面，就是頽廢。這也是一樣的受了環境的支配，同浪漫傾向差不多：所差的，就是他們更沒有勇氣來超脫現實而浪漫，雖然他們對於現實還是不滿足着；他們祇明把時間化費在搖頭和嘆大擈中呻吟中！</p>
<p>總之，這是每一個沒落中的小資産階級靑年備有的意識，雖然有些意志强的，然這祇是百分中之一二。他們沒有像資産階級們對於事業上奮鬥的毅力，也沒有無産階級對於那樣熱烈革命的情緒；他們祗有在消極中悲嘆着，呻吟着，麻醉着自己！</p>
<p>由此，我們可以看消極裏的積極和消極裏的消極都是一個半斤，一個八兩根本要不得的東西。要革除這一種病態，就必須每一個靑年對於時代的現狀要有深刻的認識，就在你底生活中去體騐着人生的意義；那時你一定會找出一條以前所不會發見道的過路，這一條路指示出消極裏的積極和消極的消極的錯誤，更指示出你，在你向時代的頂尖上跑去！因爲人生的生活本來是一面極透明的鏡子，照得出我們的需要；也告訴我們，拖上了時代的尾巴已是不足够的了！</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 旋之女士</p>
<p>暮春的暖和的天氣，和煦的陽光，紅綠的花柳，的確給予人們不少的愉快，和活躍躍的生氣，但綿綿的春雨，簾也似的老是在窗前懸掛着，這未免使梅仙的心坎裏增加了苦悶，惡鬱，而重新浮現起過去的悲哀的傷痕了。</p>
<p>梅仙的年紀雖然還未滿二十二歲，可是可寳貴的靑春早已經靜悄悄逝去了，她的眉頭上的深刻的縐痕，好像碑銘似的紀刻着她幾年來爲生活而掙扎的流浪的生活。當她的生活問題不能得解决的時候，她總是這樣的嘆氣着「人生，這就是人生嗎！？還不如自殺來得痛快！」然而她始終沒有實行的勇氣，因爲她還眷念着母親的慈愛。</p>
<p>佇立在雨裏的街燈，吐射出來的光芒，格外地顯示得暗淡，像失眠的人的眼睛，無神地蒙上一層薄霧。</p>
<p>約莫五六年前吧！天空也是這般的黑暗，沒有月亮，也沒有星星，空間裏滿含着潮濕的水氣，毛毛雨時下時止，她就在這個時候，别離了掛着漓漓的淚珠的慈母，靜悄悄地跟着鄰居的英姊趁着東下的輪船跑到上海來升學了。</p>
<p>她的家庭本來是很簡單的，除了父母親之外，只有一個哥哥和一個年輕的弟弟，而且父親又是一鄕的鄕長。在這小小的鄕村中，她們的生活要算是最優裕的。</p>
<p>可是，她的父母的頭腦却很腐舊，雖然年紀很小就考上了功名，他一貫的主張，以爲女子無才便是德」，絶對不讓梅仙離開家鄕到外面來升學，當他看見鄰居的英小姐每個假期從上海放學回來的時候，穿着短的不過膝蓋的黑綢裙，他總是要搖搖腦袋，說着「世風日下」這一套陳腐的老話。</p>
<p>梅仙爲了自己的學業，曾經背着她的父親痛哭了多少次數，她的母親忍不住愛女的悲切，也和她的父親鬧嘴了幾回，但結果只得到父親的一頓臭駡「年紀這般大的姑娘，還讓她到外面去唸書，什麽男女同學，那眞豈有此理」。搖搖頭擺着脚步氣憤憤地上書齋抽大烟去了。</p>
<p>他的母親雖然沒有上過學校受過高深的敎育，不也像她的父親般的滿肚子裏藏着之乎者也的聖賢底詩書，然而她却很能了解一切的世故，覺得無論男女進學校唸書是必需的，最後，她終於把她十餘年來私下積蓄的金錢，管不了她的父親的反對，讓梅仙跟着英小姐一同到上海來升學。</p>
<p>閃電般的時間，飛也似的在梅仙的眼前閃過了，現在她的學業已告了一個段落了，她决意把她幾年來在學校所學的一點學問爲社會服務，同時也可以解决了她的最低限度的生活問題，但社會的詐僞，汚濁，惡劣丨人們的炎凉的世態，到處都使她碰壁，起了無限的失望</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>！把活潑潑的天眞，可寳貴的靑春，一點一滴緩緩的消磨殆盡了。</p>
<p>過去的潦倒的生活的縮影，一幕一幕很淸晰地湧上梅仙的腦海裏來，於是，她的頭腦覺得有點昏痛了，她下意識地把窗幔拉開來，無力地躺倒在床上。　　夜像死一般的靜寂，只有窗外的淅瀝的雨聲和小站鐘很合拍的在節奏着。</p>
<h3>初夏的風</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>去年，一個狂歡的聖誕節之夜，自己不承認是女子而終究是個女子的菲，她遍邀了上海的知交朋友，在跳舞塲裏灌了兩杯猛烈的酒液，說：「廣州的朋友等着我，再會吧，上海！」就這個樣子我們悄然地送她去南國的輪船，雖然俊說了一句「上海的朋友也需要你！」</p>
<p>第二個我們相識時的春季送走了，從南國飄來了她的音訊。她說到了廣州後，她的生活簡直她做夢也沒有想到過的；無論在精神和物質方面。她踏上熱帶的地土，就開始着無職業的遊民生活，等着她的朋友並沒有像需要她的朋友一般的給她安慰。四川雖然她的故鄕，但是她永遠離不開上海。她說她要像離滬時一樣的奇突，在一個偶然的日子投到上海的懷抱中來。</p>
<p>菲，你天眞的，熱情的姑娘，我眞抱歉，在我記憶中已不復有她的影子存在了。我們相識而過從日密，最後走上了那必然之路，終究逼迫離開上海。你何嘗有等着她的廣州朋友，你遏不住熱情的奔放，借了酒精的力量，呑咽的了眼淚悄悄地離去。姑娘，你一定感到一種人生的苦痛了！在接到了你的信，我曾遍問送别你的朋友，但是誰也沒有你的米行隻字，菲，你怨恨我，所以獨自寄我那封長長的信？我將怎樣深深地向你贖罪呢？</p>
<p>菲，同是人生途上的同憐虫，在偶然的機會上我們認識了，該是我們多麽榮幸！你是個豪放的女子，我們坦白地做朋友，這幾個月的歡聚，各自的心靈上深深地感到無可言喩的快感。你在我小樓中喝醉了酒，你帮助我的朋友俊，在平坦的大道上我們沒有男女的顧忌；然而不知道呢，最後會跟入這不幸的漩渦！菲，你是知道我的，我脫離了故鄕到上海來，就爲了我相依爲命的妻子。你們也有過幾次會面以上的談話。對於你最後的舉動，我也曾强過自己的情感婉勸你，你終究是個女子，我也終究是個男子啊！我帶走你那張放大照相的時候，我料不到你在幾天以後藉酒精的力量離開上海，姑娘，我將說些什麽呢？　　菲，你要歸來了，上海的朋友需要你，希望你從前夢境似的一切遺留在你咒咀的廣州，踏上上海的時候再還你那個天眞的，豪放的姑娘，像我們初見面時一樣。</p>
<p>俊，這裏你相識的朋友等候着你，我的小樓中預備着汽水，白金龍。姑娘，大槪沒有忘懷吧，一個ｄｅ　ａｒｔ的聚會。</p>
<p>初夏的風吹進我的小樓，是從南國以來的，菲，我每天注視着日歷，像今天就是那個偶然的日子，有一個天眞的，豪放的姑娘重加進我們的集團。</p>
<p>上海的朋友等着你，姑娘！</p>
<h3>觀螞蟻劇社第一次公演</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>我們很欣慰縮在今年戲劇運動仍然不致於十分寂寞。在最近幾天中，我們知道有復旦劇社的「瓊斯皇」，有女聲遊藝會「夏夜之夢」和「奇蹟」，又有這螞蟻劇社的「金寳」及其他。</p>
<p>螞蟻劇社這一次還是第一次公演。</p>
<p>除了「父歸」和「月亮上升」之外，再有一個新的劇本「金寳」。新的劇本能够不斷的産生，自然是很好的現象，不過在比例上新的劇本祗是三分之一，而「父歸」和「月亮上升」差不多已給人看得厭煩了　　菊池寬的「父歸」在一九三四年公演，可以說完全失却了時代的意義，雖然說在他日的劇本創作中，「父歸」到底還是較好的一個。可是菊池寬到底是一個從過渡時代的調和主義者。在他的原劇本中，大兒子反對父親，不肯供養，然至最後終於因着母親和弟妹們的泣勸，親自去門外找父親回來。幸虧近年來在中國上演，大家將後面怯弱的矛盾的行爲刪去了，使賢兒始終成爲一個反封建的勇士，這比較原自然是好了不少。而這一次公演也是如此。</p>
<p>然而在演出成績上說，這次是沒有怎樣成功的，主要的是做賢兒的太弱，他沒有適當的動作以加重劇的情調，而說白了還嫌平淡。因此，劇的重心在他身上，反面沒有加重同樣父親和母親也沒有適當的做戲。這無論如何是應該由導演負責。譬如四個人圍坐方桌吃飯的一塲，在日本的習慣上。可以使觀象看見四個人的側面而將小方桌斜擺，但至中國却非方方正正的擺在屋子中間不可，假使佈景沒有採用斜角度的話，於吳女兒是背向觀衆坐着整備的掩藏了母親。不過這也不是余無辦法可想的，如使女兒在門前看了父親的一段話在盛飯的時候說，等着剛要走近桌子坐下的時候，便聽見父親在喊貞娘，這樣便可以活潑許多了。······諸如此類，可證明導演沒有補救劇的缺憾。其中幾人以柳蔭女土較好，但不及在Ｌａｄｉｅｓ　ａｎｄ　Ｇｅｎｔｌｅｍｅｎ」中那般討好。燈光由明至智沒有很好的做到，特别是窗外的光太强，沒有由黃昏至黑暗的感覺。</p>
<p>第二個戲「月亮上升」，在無名劇人公演時，王瑛和魏鶴齡二君曾經有過很好的成績。這一次飾逃犯者似乎欠缺一點，而一方面向警察掩飾，另一方而得在動作和臉部表情中暗示觀衆，他便是懸賞緝拿的逃犯，這是和王瑛君一樣沒有做到的。整個的看來，我們知道飾逃犯的那位是沒有充分的舞台修養的。飾警察的比較還好。</p>
<p>以上二戲，「父歸」無論何次公演，差不多總可以博得觀衆之眼淚，這因爲那種舊倫理，東西，很容易給舊觀念的人們所接收。同樣，這一次，（我看的是最後一塲）又有一個女孩子在放聲大哭了。而「月亮上升」和「父歸」一樣是翻譯而來的，可是西洋人的生活習慣，不能和「父歸」那般有其固有的東方色彩而爲中國人所理解，特别是台詞的歐化，也不爲一般觀衆所理解，因此在收獲上是大大的减少了。希望今後有人將其改譯，假使我們還承認有其抽象的意義的話。本來中國人扮裝西洋人，比較的是不易逼眞的，特别是那兩個少警察，更無西洋人的風味。旣如此，何不將其改爲中國人呢？這一點，似乎在無名劇人第二次公演時也曾提及。</p>
<p>最後，我們得十分重視那新劇本「金寳」了。</p>
<p>「金寳」是取材於豐收之後的農村，這當我在白天看了電影「黃金榖」之後，使我找出了這二者之間的許多相同點。不錯，在目前這種相同的題材，眞是太普遍了，所以「黃金榖」的作者看到了，而「金寳」的作者也看到了。在此，使我想起李仁諸君在「演劇藝術」第二期上，硬派我的「高貴的人們」是抄襲了「子夜」，這種悞解，我並不欲聲辯，不過說明「子夜」中太普遍了的題材，未始不是不待見看「子夜」而也可以採取的。關於這一點，我在千秋社將出版的該劇的單行本上，略有說明，而在此附帶的說到批評人之態度，因爲我們决不能說「金寳」是抄襲了「黃金糓」。</p>
<p>再轉到「金寳」本身，那末我承認作者對於鄕村的眞實的本質，確是看到了，但對於現象的觀察，却還嫌不够，在這方面，我們可從金寳和她的戀人公開而大胆承認她們之間的戀愛，而覺得那並非現階段中的農家最普遍的現象，然而其他的人物，都是相當現實的，雖然如金少爺或收肥田粉賬的人，略嫌過火了一點。當然，這都不過是創作的技術問題，不能以活生生的人物出現於舞台而不能獲得百分之百的效果。僅僅是這些，我們得相信作者是很容易，改正過來的。</p>
<p>但是對於問題的本質，我們相信作者是探求了豐收成災之眞實的原因，通過了正確的世界觀而指出了必然的前途。他說明連年的天災，已使農村陷於破産之地位了，而豐收之年，由於高利貸的剝削，地主的高壓，帝國主義經濟之侵略，他們仍然是陷於生死不能之境地。另一方面，作者從修公路拆民房和地主帶領保安隊槍殺農民，更說明他對於現社會之憤恨。這，可以證明作者是正視現實的了。而金寳的愛人之悲慘的死，我們還不可以看出勝的前途嗎？</p>
<p>當然，我們還可以指出許多技術不够的地方，除了那種戀愛的沒有必要之外，同時那請人疏通免拆房屋，似乎應當更强調一點，在開始時就提出，以免在中間提出時覺着突然。又如以打花鼓的父女上塲，以點出「十年就有九年荒······小戶人家賣兒郎」，也覺得不經濟，未知是否可使他們父女成爲劇中更重要一點的人物，在此我知道作者是爲了方便演出，怕人多混亂舞台，所以台上經常是兩個人，然而在最後的一塲，如使打花鼓的人們都一直支持到最後，再加些羣衆，這樣，最後的怒吼，該是十分緊張的吧。此外那個靑年農民僅僅是爲了愛人的被奪而反抗起來，也覺得太英雄了一點似的，金少爺駡收租人的大快人心，也不大好。</p>
<p>至於舞台的裝置使鄕村風味頗爲濃厚，只嫌還太平景象了一點。燈光無甚變化。不過如將時間由黃昏支持到黑夜，最後的塲面，使其火光熊熊，那我想更好看了。</p>
<p>演員以飾老農的最好，金寳次之。她的台詞，字與字的距離太平均了，雖然她能够說得淸楚而慢。其他靑年農民不够，金少爺諸人和收肥田粉賬的，都嫌過火。木匠還適合身份。我們希望，當金寳第二次上演時，也看到更好的成績。</p>

<p>丈夫操作半月·代价十元！</p>
<p>妻子絲袜一双、袁頭廿　！</p>
<h3>談娘姨</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>娘姨雖然是處着低下的人生地位，雖然是備受着精神上靈魂上的苦痛，但是一般的說來，她們的生活環境却多數是好的，至少是要比通常的工人階級良好的多。</p>
<p>不過，事實上有一個必要的條件，就是要人品生得縹緻些，而且要年輕些，最好還得俏皮些，風情些，如果是鷄皮鶴髮，或者是年雖輕而貎殊醜，則那也是苦惱的事，單單撈四五元月工，吃的是殘羹餘粒，睡的是扶梯下，或三層擱，或晒台，而又精神上不勝其苦，蓋亦與衆無異也。</p>
<p>講到年輕而縹緻的，則其神通之廣大，往往使人意想不到。我們只要略略留心一下物色娘姨的人家就不難知道，他們走到薦頭店，分明在十數分鐘内，無論怎樣是偵猜不出誰個性情良善，而又會做事。只不過從面孔上身材上去决定雇誰。這樣，縹緻的，年輕的，就佔着老大的便宜，一見就中選。於是跟着上闊家的大厦，主子看着她非常中意，就難免背着少奶奶向她尋開心（這是第一步）進一步就很有成爲暗地的如夫人可能，等到這時候，主子無論是怎樣的慳吝，也總有油湯給她喝。</p>
<p>其次也有年老了的老太爺，尙示婚娶的小少爺，都愛漂亮的娘姨，只要自己當心些，不把破綻給主子見了，也往往能進行得很須利。</p>
<p>落在這種環境下的娘姨們，其生活十九都是過得頗爲舒適的，主子們並不當她是眞正的娘姨（雖也不能視爲眞正的家人）一般的吃喝穿着固不在話下，也有汽車坐，也有包車坐，也有電影看，也有馬將义，也能上西餐館，也能一同有說有笑。每日只要略略照顧一些瑣事，重的工作都給别的僕人做去了。</p>
<p>就是比較次一點的，主子們固不甚歡喜，却也能得到同等階級的車夫一類的人的靑睞，這樣雖不能說與主子們勾搭的好，却也並不算壞，車夫會請她去看電影，坐茶館，工作他會替她照應得周到，也能在小賬上撈便宜，或至額外送錢給她，總之她們是能得到人家的靑</p>

<p>睞，能佔便宜，能生活優裕，不愁吃着沒有着落，這是無可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>所以，平日我特别注意，愛而近路有上二十家的薦頭店，都彷彿是專爲娘姨們開的，找不到有幾個男工坐在那些地方。</p>
<p>上海原是女人的世界，連娘姨也在其内，這是我新近的一種發現，實也是一個可以研究的社會問題。</p>

<h3>Manchurian Railway Technicians Arrive in Yuguan to Prepare for Through Train Service; Yin Tong Cables from Beiping, Saying He Will Soon Return North; Details of Through Train Service Still Under Negotiation; Tang Wai Ci Discusses the Situation of Through Train Service</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Over thirty technicians from the Japanese Manchurian Railway Company arrived in Shanhaiguan this morning from Shenyang by special train and stayed at the railway hotel, commencing all procedures such as preparing for the Ping-Shen through train travel agency. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong cabled from Beiping that he plans to leave Shanghai on the 10th to return north. Details of the through train service are still under negotiation.

<p>(Nanjing) Someone went to interview Tang Youren to inquire about the through train issue. According to him, this matter has not been resolved at present. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi have not yet negotiated the through train issue. The Shenyang Tourist Bureau of the Japanese side selling tickets may be a high-handed tactic on their part. This news has been seen in the newspapers, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a report. When asked who is representing the Japanese side in negotiating the through train service with us, he replied that the Commander of the Kwantung Army stationed in the Three Northeastern Provinces is the main body negotiating the through train service. When asked about the negotiation situation and all the details, Tang replied that this matter cannot be fully discussed in a few words, and before the negotiation is resolved, the details cannot be disclosed.

It is said that after the through train service is opened, the war zone issue can be easily resolved. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng paid a visit to He Yingqin this morning to report on the progress of negotiations on the war zone issue in Tianjin, and then visited Ju Zheng and Chen Lifu to report on everything. (6th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization Implements a Conscription System</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Visitors from Liaoning talk about the puppet organization currently implementing a conscription system.

<h3>The Possibility of the Panchen Lama Returning to Tibet Increases; The Circumstances of Longshar's Murder</h3>
<p>Longshar (transliteration), the former commander-in-chief of the Tibetan army in Ximola, was assassinated in Lhasa on May 30th. His death was tragic. He was first gouged out of his eyes and then killed. His three sons and four comrades have now been arrested because four junior officers of the Tibetan army admitted to joining Longshar and others in plotting to eliminate Chinese influence and prevent the Panchen Lama from returning to Tibet. The discovery of this conspiracy has further strengthened the government's position, and the Panchen's return</p>
<p>to Tibet is increasingly likely. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>Details of the tragic death of Longshar, the former commander-in-chief of the Tibetan army in Ximola, who was Dalai Lama's confidant, have only been heard today. Longshar was lured into the Dalai Lama's palace on May 10th. He was disarmed and stripped of his clothes, but while taking off his shoes, Longshar quickly took a piece of paper hidden in his shoe, put it in his mouth, and swallowed it. In Tibetan custom, to curse an enemy to death, one writes the enemy's name and treads on it. This act is equivalent to conspiracy. The crowd guessed that the paper Longshar swallowed must have contained the names of the Regent and the Prime Minister, otherwise, he would not have swallowed it so urgently. Representatives of senior monks visited the Regent and asked for Longshar's release. The Regent told them about the swallowing of the paper. The representatives also recognized Longshar's guilt. Two days later, Longshar's eyes were gouged out with red-hot needles, and then he was put to death. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) An Qing said that all parts of Tibet are peaceful. In the past, the Tibetan people did not know the situation in the country and misunderstood rumors that the central government had abolished religion, causing many misunderstandings. This time, Chairman Shi, under the orders of the central government, comforted the Tibetans in various regions, explained the central government's policy of allowing people freedom of religion, and showed more care for the Tibetans, distributing items to various temples. The Tibetans were even more grateful. However, because no one is in charge of Tibetan affairs, they especially welcome the Panchen Lama to return to preside over politics and religion. The Panchen expressed that he will only follow the orders of the central government. (6th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Greatly Increase at Various Passes of the Great Wall; Sentries Posted Every Few Miles to Strictly Check Pedestrians; Prince Chichibu, Brother of the Japanese Emperor, Will Inspect Various Passes of the Great Wall</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Prince Chichibu, brother of the Japanese Emperor, will inspect various passes of the Great Wall.

<h3>Degradation of Chinese Silk Should Be Remedied to Restore Its Position in the World Market; British Silk Industry Association Boycotts Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(London) The British Silk Industry Association is quite apprehensive because negotiations with Japan are proceeding extremely slowly, and Secretary of Commerce Runciman answered questions in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that he was still unable to comment on this matter. The British Federation of Industries met today and intends to ask the government to pay attention to the importance of immediate action. The secretary of the Silk Industry Association told a Reuters reporter that in the first four months of last year, Japanese silk imports to Britain were 3.6 million square yards, and this year, although Japanese silk exports to other countries have decreased compared to the past, imports to Britain have reached 6.6 million square yards. In 1932, Japanese rayon imports to Britain totaled 257,000 square yards; in 1933, they jumped to 2.8 million square yards. How much more will it increase this year? Only God knows. Tax rates are not enough to resist the low prices of Japanese goods. The only effective method is quotas. The Silk Industry Association does not want to reject the inherent silks of the Far East, but European-style silks imitated by Japan must be rejected. Chinese silk is naturally the best in the world, but it is strange that the government has not concentrated its efforts to remedy the degradation of Chinese silk. (6th Reuters)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Current Stage of the Soviet-Japanese Conflict</h3>
<p>The Soviet and Japanese governments have recently been in intense dispute over North Sea fisheries bidding and ruble exchange rate issues. Prior to this, the Soviet side adopted a deliberate delaying tactic during the Sino-Eastern Railway negotiation meetings, which has made Japan feel uneasy, even to the point of wanting to use this as an opportunity to expand its militaristic ambitions. Recently, the "Jixian," a ship of the puppet state of Manchukuo, was bombarded by Soviet artillery from across the river in Tongjiang. According to the Soviet version, the "Jixian" was secretly photographing the situation on the opposite bank, and they fired a warning as a self-defense measure. The Japanese side, however, accused the Soviet guards of firing without authorization, demanding compensation and an apology, as well as a guarantee of future safety. Since the incident, both sides have lodged protests against each other, and the war of words in the news media of both countries has also been extremely contentious. Judging from the current situation, this matter is unlikely to escalate immediately into a serious war. However, "treading on frost leads to hard ice," the issue has been gradually coming to a head. Japan and the Soviet Union have been wary of each other for some time, and the thicker the atmosphere of animosity, the more likely a war will erupt. One only needs to observe the two countries stationing troops on the border, with heavily fortified positions, and their especially active preparations for air power, there is already a sense of impending conflict.</p>
<p>If the Japanese army were to advance and occupy Siberia, the most immediate practical benefits they could gain would be the exclusive control of oil in northern Sakhalin and North Sea fisheries. Japan is regarded as one of the world's five major powers, aiming to compete with the United States in the Pacific to the east and attempting to seize the market on the northern shore of the Indian Ocean to the west. However, its natural resources are limited, similar to Italy in Europe. Not only does it rely on foreign countries for nine out of ten of its steel consumption needs, but even for petroleum, which is essential for modern industry and warfare, its maximum production capacity is only 450,000 tons (including the output of oil mines in northern Sakhalin operated by the Japanese). The remaining three million tons or more are entirely dependent on overseas imports. The Japanese lease rights for oil field development in northern Sakhalin will expire in 1936. The Japanese are currently extracting approximately 520 to 530 tons per day in the area, while the production operated by the Russians has already surpassed that of the Japanese. According to the research of Soviet Academy of Sciences scholar Gubkin, the underground oil reserves in the two oil regions operated by the Russians are at least 40 million tons. Japan covets this treasure and is eager to seize it by creating a pretext. Furthermore, regarding competition in North Sea fisheries, when Japan and the Soviet Union concluded a fisheries treaty in 1928, the relative strength of the fishing industries of both sides was approximately eight parts Japanese fishermen to two parts Soviet fishermen, giving Japan an absolute advantage. Later, due to the Russians' rapid catch-up, the situation became equal last year. Once the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan is completed, it will be even more difficult for Japanese fishermen to maintain their old businesses, which is self-evident. This is something Japan would never be willing to accept.</p>
<p>However, the climate in northern Sakhalin is harsh, transportation is obstructed, and there are very few suitable harbors for mooring ships along the coast. Moreover, oil extraction cannot be successfully achieved in a short period. Even if the Japanese seize the Russian land with all their might, it is highly questionable whether it would be truly worthwhile. However, seizing the benefits of the fishing industry may not be too difficult. This kind of non-peaceful armed seizure was seen before in 1920. At that time, Japan sent six divisions of troops to Siberia, spending more than 500 million yen. The Soviet side only used a small number of guerrillas from the Far East to contend with them, eventually forcing the Japanese army to withdraw from Siberia. Today's Soviet Union is by no means comparable to the Soviet Union of fifteen years ago, which had no power to resist. If the Japanese army invades its territory by a single step, it will inevitably come out to fight. Even if the Japanese army, with its transportation advantages, can occupy the Russian Maritime Provinces and the Ussuri Railway line as far as Chita in a short period, it will be difficult to cross Lake Baikal easily. According to the estimates of Japanese military experts, it would require at least fifty divisions to occupy and maintain eastern Siberia alone. If the Soviet Union actively responds, it may be necessary to use a force of 150 divisions. Considering Japan's current financial situation, how can it afford this? Therefore, the Japanese militarists, who are fond of grandiose schemes and eager for success, although they have repeatedly chanted high-sounding slogans of conquering Russia, still dare not challenge it lightly.</p>
<p>However, Japan's power to invade the north may be insufficient, but its power to invade the south is more than adequate. For example, the cotton produced in Hebei and Shandong in our country is also a raw material that its light industry and munitions industry desperately want to absorb. Moreover, the importance of the commercial market is far above the North Sea fishing area. The future trend is that Japan may need to adopt a defensive posture against the Soviet Union militarily, while its aggression against China will inevitably continue recklessly and without scruples. This is predictable.</p>
<h3>Capital Police Detect Communist Party Members; Three Captured Successively</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to confidential reports received by the Special Police Section of the police department, Mao Zedong of the Communist bandits dispatched personnel to infiltrate Nanjing to secretly plot disturbances. Therefore, personnel were dispatched to conduct a strict search everywhere, and it was discovered that Bai Yuanfu, Mao's representative and organizing committee member for the Jinghu-Hanping (Beijing-Shanghai-Wuhan-Beiping) Red Army rescue committee, Yao Naixun, chief of staff and head of the propaganda department stationed in Nanjing, as well as other assassination squad members, propagandists, and false detectives, were hiding at No. 45 Xiangtai Lane in Xiaguan. On the evening of the 31st, officers disguised themselves and conducted surveillance around the area. While the bandits were unaware, they were surrounded and captured on the spot. A seal of the headquarters of the Fake Red Army First Army Corps, two appointment letters from Bai and Yao, multiple membership certificates, one handgun, and multiple rounds of ammunition were seized and taken to the police department. After solving the case, the police department continued to send personnel to wait at the bandit's den. On the 2nd, Shao Chongwei, who had just arrived from Shanghai to make contact, was also captured and taken to the police department for interrogation. At first, the bandits denied everything, but when presented with the evidence, they all confessed without hesitation. They have now been handed over to the judicial section for punishment.

<h3>Disarmament Deadlock Unbreakable; France Opposes Henderson's Proposal; Proposes Alternative Plan Advocating Five Measures; But Fears UK, US, and Italy May Not Agree</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After being criticized by Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, yesterday, French Foreign Minister Barthou presented a compromise proposal to the main committee this afternoon, combining France's own security demands with the substantive disarmament proposals of the UK and US. This proposal was drafted by the French delegation throughout the morning and was finally presented at the main committee meeting in the afternoon. This new compromise proposal advocates that the Disarmament Conference should continue to discuss the two major issues of ensuring national security and reducing armaments, but that security issues should be resolved before disarmament. The main points of the French proposal are as follows: (1) The Political Committee should study and draft a regional agreement for Europe; (2) The General Committee should plan and implement security measures for the disarmament convention; (3) The Aviation Committee should study the abolition of aerial bombing, the internationalization of civil aviation, and the reduction of air forces; (4) Further investigate the issue of private manufacturing and distribution of war materials and study solutions, aiming to implement controls; (5) Invite Chairman Henderson to send the proposals of Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov to various governments for study. After French Foreign Minister Barthou presented his new compromise proposal, US representative Davis immediately proposed that the main committee adjourn until Friday to facilitate the adjustment of Barthou's and Henderson's proposals. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou, incited by Henderson's call yesterday to propose a plan acceptable to all representatives, presented a lengthy resolution at 3:45 PM today when the main committee of the Disarmament Conference reconvened. This plan is likely to be opposed by Italy, the US, and the UK. Its content is as follows: (1) The Political Committee should immediately discuss regional security pacts and discuss the monitoring of guarantees for the implementation of the pacts, but this discussion should not hinder any private negotiations; (2) Civil aviation should be internationalized, aerial bombing should be abolished, and land and air forces should be reduced; (3) The examination of arms manufacturing and trade should continue in accordance with the statements made by the US delegation; (4) The General Committee should instruct the main committee to take necessary steps to complete the drafting of the convention when the Chairman convenes a meeting of the General Committee. The plan most strongly recommends that the Soviet proposal to transform the Disarmament Conference into a permanent organization be sent to various governments for consideration.

<h3>Barthou and Henderson Engage in Heated Verbal Battle; "Living Drama" in Representatives' Words; Reconciliation of Differing Views Difficult</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the main committee meeting of the Disarmament Conference this afternoon, two experienced debaters engaged in a fierce verbal battle, clashing head-on with intense emotions. The two main protagonists were Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, and French Foreign Minister Barthou. Unfortunately, journalists were barred from observing, and the lively and engaging scene can only be known through the accounts of the participating representatives.</p>
<p>After a half-hour delay, the main committee meeting reconvened this afternoon, and British Lord Privy Seal Eden spoke in support of Henderson's resolution, which was tantamount to immediately adjourning the Disarmament Conference. Barthou then made a heated speech opposing the entirety of Henderson's resolution, saying that while he also agreed to invite Germany to return to the conference, it should be done in a fair and open manner and not through "backdoor tactics." Barthou also reiterated France's determination to uphold its position. As Barthou was speaking eloquently, Spanish representative Madariaga interrupted him, and Barthou angrily said to Madariaga, "You are setting a dangerous precedent, but I have no time to care about that now!" His voice was stern, like a strict teacher addressing a mischievous child. Barthou criticized every point in Henderson's proposal, almost leaving no part unscathed. The atmosphere was tense at the time, and Henderson stated that he intended to resign immediately and convene the General Committee to report on the obstruction of certain representatives, which made it impossible for the main committee to continue its work. Henderson said that if his impartiality was challenged, he would also offer his resignation letter to the group of dignitaries who had elected him as Chairman of the Disarmament Conference in the past. Henderson then made a warning to the audience, which greatly moved the listeners. His warning was, "I am here today only as the protector of the lives of hundreds of trillions of young people in the world, whose lives are all in our hands." Then he turned to Barthou and said, "If you have a proposal, you may present it." Henderson continued, saying that the resolution he had drafted could be agreed to by a majority, and that he had not neglected the issue of security. Since Barthou had rejected this plan, he should be asked to draft another one. Barthou then rose and said that his recent words were an old parliamentarian speaking his mind to another old parliamentarian, and that he had no intention of attacking Henderson, so he asked him to remain as chairman. Barthou said to Henderson almost apologetically, "Mr. Henderson, please stay in your position." Barthou then reiterated that he had the utmost respect for the chairman's absolute impartiality, and that if he had exceeded the customary etiquette of debate, he was very sorry. Regarding future procedures, he suggested forming a drafting committee to integrate the proposals of Russia and the neutral country of Turkey. Henderson then announced that the meeting would be adjourned until 3:30 PM the next afternoon. When the meeting ended, the British delegation was extremely pessimistic, feeling that there was no chance of reconciling the differing views of all parties and that the future was extremely bleak. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to Chenbao newspaper, French Foreign Minister Barthou is planning a trip to Rome and intends to discuss the current situation between France and Italy with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers' Geneva correspondents unanimously declared that yesterday's clash between French Foreign Minister Barthou and Disarmament Chairman Henderson in Geneva had intensified the situation and made the future even more pessimistic. Barthou resolutely rejected all kinds of compromise methods. The Daily News reported that yesterday's situation had become extreme, and those in the meeting believed that Barthou was deliberately sabotaging the Disarmament Conference. A diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle said that it would be better for the representatives of various countries to leave Geneva as soon as possible, which would be beneficial to peace and disarmament. Barthou's attitude had a very bad impression on the British side, and he spoke about security issues in a tone that suggested there was no need for British cooperation. Therefore, the newspaper believed that the French Foreign Minister's unwillingness to contact the UK had become clear. The Daily Telegraph also stated that total collapse was imminent, while The Times stated that the point of conflict was very clear. The so-called "security first" advocated by France and Russia was an attempt to organize a defensive alliance to deal with Germany with military force. They called this organization "security" and wanted the League of Nations to recognize it. In seeking security, France had abandoned negotiations with the UK and embraced the Soviet Union. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers here reported that the opposing forces in Europe have now become increasingly sharp, with one side advocating disarmament and the other advocating security. Yesterday's meeting of the main committee of the Disarmament Conference was the most active gathering since the establishment of the League of Nations. Both Le Journal and Le Matin believed that the meeting was extremely chaotic and that it was impossible to give an accurate report. French newspapers expressed great dissatisfaction with the withdrawal of the security plan by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov due to the opposition of Italy and the US. Local public opinion was also unable to satisfy the so-called neutral proposals, as these proposals were essentially the same as the UK's position. Most newspapers predicted that the Disarmament Conference would soon close and reconvene in October. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>France Strengthens Military; Will Build Underground Oil Tanks; Protect Naval Fuel; Prevent Aircraft Bombing</h3>
<p>(Paris) France will soon begin a five-year program to build underground oil tanks, the purpose of which is to protect naval fuel from aerial bombing. Naval Minister Pietri told the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives today that of the 82.5 million francs allocated to the Navy Department under the national defense plan, 26 million francs will be used to build underground oil tanks, and 80 million francs will be used for coastal defenses, with particular emphasis on the establishment of artillery batteries on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, the French coast of the Dover Strait, and the French coast. Interior Minister Sarraut also briefly outlined French aerial defenses at today's cabinet meeting, saying that a bill to protect the public from aerial bombing would be submitted to the Congress. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, Naval Minister Pietri attended the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives and explained the use of the 825,000,000 franc budget requested by the Navy Department. This budget will be disbursed over five years, including 595,000,000 francs for the construction of liquid fuel storage facilities, 80,000,000 francs for the construction of artillery batteries on the coasts of Africa and northern France, and 150,000,000 francs for the preparation of naval aviation. Pietri also explained the Navy's second batch of shipbuilding program, which stipulates the construction of one "Dunkerque" class cruiser and one submarine and one torpedo boat, with a total displacement of less than 40,000 tons. According to reports, the total national defense expenditure requested by the three departments of the army, navy, and air force is 2,980,000,000 francs. The ministers have attended the Finance Committee one after another to make explanations. The committee is scheduled to express its views tomorrow and will probably approve it. Also, there have been rumors that the government intends to issue public bonds, but Finance Minister Germain-Martin has firmly stated that the government has no intention of issuing any form of debt.

<h3>UK Trade in Manchuria; Simon Does Not Believe It Will Be Subject to Discrimination; UK Authorities Closely Monitor Shanghai Special Court Reorganization Plan</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon said in the House of Commons today in response to a question that he had recently received a report from the Far East that had studied the prospects for British trade in "Manchukuo." The report is currently under government consideration. When asked by Member of Parliament Lambert whether British trade was being discriminated against in "Manchukuo," Simon replied that he did not believe so, but that the matter would soon become clear and that he would consider publishing a report stating the truth. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting of the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Knox asked about the Shanghai Special Court reorganization plan. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that a Chinese news agency claimed in December of last year that China had now begun to amend civil litigation procedures and that all plans regarding this amendment would apply to the International Court. Beyond this, he could not offer any further information. The issue is very complicated and the British government will certainly be concerned about British interests. British Ambassador to China Cadogan is currently closely monitoring the matter. Knox suggested that since the agreement of 1930 is due to expire in two years, it would be appropriate to notify the relevant countries to discuss a joint response. The Foreign Secretary replied that he would be happy to consider this point, but that he believed it was best to pay attention to the current situation for the time being and maintain contact with the British Ambassador.

<h3>Britain Suspends War Debt Payments - U.S. Greatly Disappointed - May Lead to Rescheduling Negotiations - France No Longer Isolated in Default</h3>
<p>(Washington) Congressional circles here unanimously anticipated that Britain would announce its suspension of debt payments after issuing its note. Associated Press reporters interviewed members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives today, who expressed disappointment, or even surprise, at Britain's failure to pay its war debts. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, compared the British note to the international currency problem, saying that Britain might not pay its debts again, or might request a reduction in war debts, unless international exchange rates were leveled. Representative Laney declared that it was regrettable that Britain, known to be wealthy and a friend of the United States, had also decided to suspend war debt payments. Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Borah, said that President Roosevelt would conduct negotiations on British debt when exercising his reciprocal tariff powers. Borah added that he did not expect payment of the debt, but that he believed Britain would be prepared to negotiate war debts if the United States applied to Britain for a reciprocal trade agreement. Senator Johnson said he was not surprised by Britain's action, stating that Britain had a long history of failing to fulfill its debt obligations and that today's public announcement would not hinder the overall situation. Farm-Labor Senator Shipstead said that Britain's action could serve as a lesson for the next great war. Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, McReynolds, said that the British Treasury report stated that Britain had more than enough resources if it was willing to collect debts. Senator Walsh said he was very disappointed after learning that Italy had joined the defaulting nations, stating that failing to pay and requesting an extension of payment were one thing, while requesting a reduction was another. Government officials insisted that the United States was prepared to listen to the opinions of debtor nations individually and would not hold a round-table conference of all debtor nations. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The local newspapers unanimously endorsed Britain's note to the United States regarding war debts, believing that while it was a failure to fulfill obligations, it was not dishonorable and that Britain's credit would not be damaged in the slightest. The London Times stated that some people were concerned that Britain's action would have a negative impact on the dignity of international agreements, but that there was no better solution. All parties involved were constrained by the current situation, and the true value of the British note lay in prompting both sides to seek a practical solution to the problem through mutual agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Britain's refusal to pay the war debts due on June 15 of this year, the so-called "commemorative repayment," to show continued recognition of the establishment of the war debt, and its automatic cancellation of this measure, is generally praised by public opinion in France. French newspapers endorse this measure because, from now on, France will no longer be a country that unilaterally breaks its contracts by refusing to pay war debts, and the actions France has taken in the past have now become legitimate. Many newspapers have expressed the hope that the United States can start new negotiations as soon as possible and revise the method of handling war debts, but fear that the government will be obstructed by the parliament, and that President Roosevelt will have difficulty implementing his policies even in the near future.

As for the existing relationship and cooperation between the various members of the British Empire, it will still be maintained. The agreement stipulates that the new political party will protect Europeans and scholars to reject the immigration or competition of Asians, but the existing rights of Asians who have already legally resided in the territory of the South African Federation will still be maintained.

<h3>New York Banks Suspend Silver Dollar Transactions in Shanghai and Hong Kong - Awaiting Final Decision on Silver Bill - Senate Silver Faction to Propose Amendments</h3>
<p>(New York) Some American banks in New York have now suspended transactions in silver dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong, pending the final decision on the provisions of the silver bill passed by the House of Representatives on May 31. It is heard that the banks have taken this action because they feel that the silver bill recognizes silver dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong as silver bars and requires the payment of a 50% profit tax. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate discussed the government's proposed silver bill this afternoon. Silver faction senators proposed numerous amendments. Democratic Senator Thomas, who has always advocated inflationary policies, proposed an amendment to make silver the main currency. The amendment proposed by Democratic Senator McGarren suggested changing the purchase of silver by issuing silver certificates to reserve 25.1% of silver in the national treasury to a mandatory order. The silver bill passed by the House of Representatives only stipulated that silver could be used to pay for American currency or debt, which did not meet the demands of the extreme silver faction and silver-expansion faction. McGarren claimed that he also proposed abolishing the provision in the House bill that imposed a 50% profit tax. McGarren declared when proposing the amendment that the government, eager for Congress to adjourn early, was unwilling for the Senate to debate the silver issue too much, so the only way was to accept his amendment. However, the government seemed unlikely to agree to the above amendments, so a fierce struggle was expected in the Senate. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>National Sericulture Improvement Association: Requesting External Efforts to Compete for Overseas Markets</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The National Sericulture Improvement Association believes that the Chinese silk market has never obtained a price assessment in the New York Silk Exchange, which is recognized worldwide, and this is a major reason why our silk has not been sold well abroad. In the past, Chinese silk merchants have made repeated efforts to compete, but they have been obstructed by Japanese merchants who automatically determined the price of Chinese silk through voting. Of course, our country considers this an excellent opportunity. The association has already sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the Minister to the United States and the Consul-General in New York to promptly make contact and also sent separate telegrams to major overseas silk merchants, urging them to earnestly compete. All parties have replied by telegram that they are making efforts. If this yields satisfactory results, then efforts will be made to improve the quality of silk, hoping that the development of the overseas silk industry market will be achieved in one fell swoop.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Guiyang, for your information: Recently, the winter telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, stated: "The Red bandits are rampant and have been poisoning the area for several years. The old nest of the Red bandits in Jiangxi has been gradually cleared after Chairman Chiang personally supervised the suppression. The Red bandits in the provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei have also fled in different directions after being jointly suppressed by the forces of each province. However, more than 8,000 men under the Red bandit He Long recently fled from Pengshui, Sichuan, and disturbed the border of Guizhou. Houping, Wuchuan, and Yanhe have successively fallen. There are frequent reports of the bandits' attempt to occupy northern and eastern Guizhou as bandit nests. The situation is serious. Considering that Guizhou Province has poor land and impoverished people and weak self-defense capabilities, if the Red bandits take advantage of this, the consequences would be unimaginable. Wang Gongshao, the provincial chairman and military commander, is deeply concerned about the Red bandits' conspiracy and has dispatched strong troops to suppress them. All sectors have organized the Guizhou Provincial Anti-Bandit Support Association to assist the government in suppressing the bandits. The association was established on June 2nd. The people of Guizhou pledge to work together to assist the government in suppressing the Red bandits. However, considering that the bandit forces are rampant and full of cunning schemes, if the bandit forces unfortunately expand, not only will the people of Guizhou suffer a terrible disaster, but the southwest will also be shaken. We earnestly request the Central Government to provide sufficient assistance to Guizhou Province for anti-bandit military operations, and also request that the generals of Sichuan and Hunan be ordered to assist in the suppression to prevent the remnants of the bandits from growing stronger and causing disaster to the whole country. This is not only a blessing for Guizhou Province but also a blessing for the Party and the country." The telegram is urgent and awaits a reply, etc. This special telegram is sent to you, hoping that you will look into it and provide assistance. The Guizhou Provincial Anti-Bandit Support Association respectfully bows.</p>

<h3>The Situation Between the Soviet Union and Japan is Relaxing and Becoming Urgent Again (Vladivostok Dispatch): The Soviet Union is Actively Deploying Defenses on the Border; The Unpredictable Relationship Between Japan and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese transferred two large divisions to station along the China Eastern Railway (the 3rd Division and the 16th Division are stationed along the China Eastern Railway) and built solid fortifications in the Greater Khingan Range, it has greatly stimulated the Soviet authorities and its people. Therefore, there has been considerable preparation recently. The first is to deploy considerable troops in important areas along the border to prepare for unforeseen circumstances. The second is to expand the airfield near Vladivostok so that it can accommodate a large number of aircraft. Third, although Vladivostok Port does not have any strong fortress installations, it has eight of the latest submarines and the necessary land equipment. The Japanese military believes that capturing Vladivostok is as easy as pie because it does not have sufficiently strong fortifications to resist the excellent Japanese army and navy. However, Vladivostok is indeed not an impregnable fortress, but it is not a defenseless city either. In fact, it is a strong military support point for the Soviet Union in the Far East, especially its aviation equipment. Japan is very afraid of it. Not only places like Changchun, Harbin, Fengtian, Dalian, Seoul, and this kind of place are feeling the threat of Vladivostok's aircraft, but even Tokyo and Osaka are somewhat apprehensive, fearing that it will not be easy to deal with calmly.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese army, especially the Kwantung Army in "Manchuria", believes that if Japan and the Soviet Union go to war, the Japanese army must capture Vladivostok in the shortest possible time, within a few hours or a day or two, otherwise the Japanese mainland will be in danger of being bombed. However, according to the current situation, the Soviet Union has already made considerable preparations, and all three aspects of land, sea, and air have practical measures (according to the reporter's observation, it will definitely not retreat without resistance). The Japanese Kwantung Army also believes that the small port of Vladivostok is not easy to capture in a very short period. Therefore, the Japanese army seems to have few effective countermeasures against the Soviet air force's attack.</p>
<p>However, Japan is still actively carrying out various military preparations along the China Eastern Railway. The Soviet Union is certainly planning the same. Recent minor incidents have all stemmed from military confrontation between the two sides. On May 13, in the area where the Songhua River and the Heilongjiang River meet, in Tongjiang, Jilin, and in the area under the jurisdiction of Mikhailovsky in the Soviet Union, a boat called "Jixian" was flying a puppet flag. The boat was sailing at the intersection of the river, and it is said that it was surveying the Soviet Union's side of the map and taking pictures while sailing. Therefore, it received three warnings from the Soviet side. Finally, it was warned with empty shells, but it was still ineffective. This led to live ammunition being fired, and the boat sailed towards the Songhua River. Afterwards, the Harbin North Manchuria Special Commissioner's Office protested to the Soviet Consul-General Slosky: (1) requesting compensation for the losses of the victims, (2) an apology from the Soviet side, (3) and future guarantees. How the Soviet side responded is still not very clear. However, the Soviet Union's military preparations are becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>In recent years, the progress of the Red Army's military preparations has been very rapid. In 1927, there were 69 infantry divisions. In 1931, it increased to 71 divisions. At the end of the first five-year plan in 1932, it increased to 76 divisions. At the end of 1933, it increased by another eight divisions. During the same period, aircraft increased from 700 to 1,600, to 2,500, and to 3,000. As for tanks, there were only 100 in 1927, 500 in 1931, 1,500 at the end of the first five-year plan, and the number reached 3,000 at the end of 1933. In the Far East, there are 600 aircraft and 500 tanks. This is the preparation in terms of weapons, but it is only part of the armament. The Soviet Union also has more specific preparations. First, she believes that modern warfare has no distinction between the front and the rear, and the battlefield should include its entire territory. Second, the guidance of the war against excellent enemy troops lies in causing the internal collapse of the enemy's army. Third, the characteristic of modern warfare is that a country's industrial strength dominates its military destiny. Fourth, the boundary between peace and war is eliminated, and a state of war is entered without declaring war. Fifth, to give that country the entire power of war, namely, industrial strength, personnel, materials, resources, and the people's livelihood, and inflict overall fatal injuries, can the war be ended. In short, the Soviet Union is not only preparing for a war that will encompass all its people, but it has also been steadily implementing its military facilities that encompass the whole country. Although it has not been thoroughly done in the Far East, its scale has expanded to many aspects, and preparations are being made to deal with incidents at any time. (Vladivostok, May 22)</p>
<h3>Japanese Invasion of the Northeast: Planning to Establish Four Bureaus: Japan Believes the Military and Political Period is Over: Expanding the Northeast Economic Control Agency</h3>
<p>Changchun dispatch: After the Japanese seized our Northeast, they now believe that the military and political period is over and are embarking on an economic period, so they are implementing plunder with more violent means. However, the previous proposals by the military, such as reorganizing the South Manchuria Railway Company and expanding the Kwantung Army Special Service Department into an Economic Headquarters, etc., failed to immediately achieve their goals due to opposition from domestic capitalists and political parties representing capitalists. Recently, they changed their policy and sought to organize an expanded Northeast economic control agency within the puppet regime as a plan to implement their plunder policy. Their initial plan is to establish four agencies in July of this year as the fundamental plan to control our Northeast economy. The content is as follows:</p>
<h3>Industrial Planning Bureau</h3>
<p>The bureau is directly under the puppet General Affairs Office and recruits personnel from various parts of the puppet organization to form a central planning agency for managing various industries in the Northeast. The bureau maintains close relations with the Japanese Kwantung Army Special Service Department and the South Manchuria Railway Company.</p>
<h3>Provisional Industrial Survey Bureau</h3>
<p>The bureau is in charge of investigating various sectors of the economy and establishing plans for developing industries. The bureau takes the same step as the Industrial Planning Bureau. Its organization is headed by the chief official of the puppet Real Affairs Department, followed by directors, administrative officers, technicians, technical officials, and other officials, totaling about 600 people. It also has an advisory committee and various committees, and dispatches personnel to reside in important locations in the Northeast. The annual expenditure is 2.9 million yuan. The main items to be investigated in the first year are: (1) agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, etc.; (2) fisheries investigation; (3) mining investigation; (4) industrial investigation; (5) electric power resources investigation; (6) commercial investigation; (7) trade investigation, etc.</p>
<h3>National Continental Science Research Institute</h3>
<p>The institute aims to research natural sciences and use them as a starting point for industry. The initial establishment fee for the first year is 4 million yuan, and the regular expenditure is 1 million yuan. The institute is directly under the puppet State Council Premier, with a chairman, ministers, and members of each department. It is divided into nine departments: physics, chemistry, biology, geology, industry, agriculture and forestry, agricultural products, animal husbandry, and hygiene. Each department is divided into sections, with a total of 36 sections.</p>
<h3>National Institute of Hygiene</h3>
<p>The various researches currently entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway for agency will be conducted in the puppet National Research Institute in the future. It is also planned to set up a research institute near the infectious disease hospital in the western suburbs of Changchun with 3 million yuan. It is currently in preparation.</p>
<h3>Daily News Telegram: Ping-Shen Traffic Plan</h3>
<p>According to a special dispatch from Osaka Mainichi Shimbun in Nanjing, regarding the traffic problem, it has been decided to organize international travel cars. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A newly established international travel agency is named the Peiping-Fengtian Travel Agency, and it is entrusted to operate the railway between Peiping and Shenyang. (3) The XX railway bureaus each spend 300,000 yuan. (3) The two railway bureaus each select two committee members to agree on rules for passenger and freight transportation and the allocation of staff selected by the two bureaus. The solution to this traffic problem is only a technical railway connection, just like the Sino-Japanese radio connection. It does not need to be submitted to the Central Political Committee, so it is expected that traffic will be opened before mid-June. (Hua Lian News Agency)</p>
<h3>Eastern Route Army Captures Liancheng: National Army Advances to 60 Li from Tingzhou</h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: According to military news recently received, after recovering Longyan, the Eastern Route Army immediately advanced towards Liancheng. At the end of last month, Jiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Army, ordered a general attack on Liancheng and set a deadline for recovering the county seat. The pseudo-24th Division, entrenched near Juxi Xihu Camp, was first defeated by the National Army on the 30th and retreated westward in droves. On the 31st, the National Army approached the county seat and surrounded the pseudo-Workers' Division and the Training Regiment defending the city. On the evening of that day, the various units of the National Army launched a large-scale attack on the city. About 2,000 to 3,000 bandits in the city resisted at the southwest stubborn gate and fired at each other. Later, a part of the National Army outflanked the north gate and attacked from three sides. The bandits could not withstand the pressure and abandoned the city and retreated to Ninghua and Changting in the northwest. The National Army completely recovered Liancheng at about 8:00 AM on the 1st. After the National Army entered the city, it issued a proclamation to appease the people, handled the aftermath, and pursued the bandits who retreated westward. Jiang Dingwen recently sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek reporting the recovery of Liancheng and the process. Now that Liancheng has been recovered, Tingzhou and Ninghua are heavily surrounded, and a certain unit of the National Army surrounding Tingzhou from Shanghang Wuping has also advanced to Shuikou, only 60 li from Tingzhou. If Changting is recovered, it can join forces with the Northern Route Army in Ruijin, the capital of the pseudo-regime. (June 2)</p>
<h3>Fengxian Party and Organizations: Oppose the New Land Survey Plan: The Provincial Implementation Steps are Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>The Fengxian County Party Department, in conjunction with local agencies and organizations, opposes the new land survey plan and implementation steps. The original text, which has been submitted to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Interior, requesting a strict ban, is roughly as follows: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in the 17th year of the Republic of China, followed the teachings of the late Premier and, during the period of political tutelage, prepared to reorganize the land, promote local autonomy, equalize land taxes, and reduce the burden on the people. Therefore, in accordance with the legal procedures for land, it first used surveying and then registration to enable the people to clearly understand the land registry and protect property rights. This is the initial step in land administration and also the people's right to self-governance. Therefore, the people of all counties in the province, upon hearing the news, rose up, all hoping for reorganization. Counties such as Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Qingpu, Jiading, and our Fengxian County have all actively carried out the reorganization, and the results have been remarkable. Unexpectedly, after Zhu Ping, the Director of the Provincial Land Bureau, arrived in the new position, he disregarded the national situation, ignored right and wrong, and forced others to do what was difficult. He used foreign ways to change Chinese customs. Just look at the general plan and implementation steps recently issued to see one aspect. For example, Article 4 stipulates that the topographic scale is 1/10,000. May I ask how the acre number can be filled in a tiny topographic map? Article 5 states that each owner should calculate the area of all his fields after receiving the notice, or hire an agent to do so. It is estimated that no more than one out of ten people has the knowledge of surveying. If an agent is hired, how can they be found in remote rural areas? Moreover, the people have already fulfilled the obligation of paying the land survey fee for many years, and there is no reason to add to the burden again. Article 6 states that if there are any errors in the owner's declaration, staff will be sent to investigate and correct them. It is found that the majority of the Chinese people are illiterate, and among those who are literate, there are few who have surveying knowledge. Since they do not have this ability, they are even more ignorant of the newly promoted three-inclined method and the new city-mu scale. Therefore, forcing people who have no knowledge of surveying to calculate the area will inevitably lead to errors. It is necessary to correct them household by household, and it is difficult to achieve simplicity even if you want to achieve speed. The above-mentioned articles are neither selfish nor reckless, resulting in public outrage. Where is the political system? Moreover, since the Director of the Land Reorganization Bureau, Dong Jinzhao, took charge of the land reorganization in Fengxian, he has been determined to do his job and has worked hard without sparing any effort. Therefore, the reorganization started, and in less than two years, the surveyed land area accounted for more than one-third of the total area of the county. The four townships of Tan Shu Guo Village and Yi Village have successively started registration, and the people are convinced. The prestige is obvious. It should be consistent from beginning to end and completed as soon as possible to strengthen the people's faith. Now, they disregard the facts and rashly change the method, which is inconsistent. They are still repeating the mistakes of the Qing Dynasty of only clearing the grain superficially. Whether it is applicable to counties that have not yet started reorganization is another matter, but the people all hope that the matter will be completed. The land survey work in Fengxian County is absolutely not applicable because the original land survey method is progressive and suitable for the people's feelings. If we abandon this and adopt this, it will violate the teachings of the late Premier, destroy the good rules that have already been implemented, and show that it is going against the trend, which is difficult to tolerate. In addition to submitting the case separately, we are forced to submit this appeal and seek your understanding and order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to prevent the newly issued provincial land survey general plan and implementation steps from being implemented to respect the land administration and serve as a warning.</p>

<h3>Recent News Regarding the State-Run Huainan Coal Mine: Completion of the Mine-Use Railway and Joint Mine-Road Foundation; Grand Commemorative Ceremony to be Held</h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Huainan Coal Mine is one of the projects sponsored by the National Government's Construction Commission. To increase domestic coal production and meet the needs of construction projects, the Construction Commission prepared for the development of the Shungeng Mountain coal mine in Huaiyuan, Anhui Province, in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic [1929], covering five mining areas with a total area of over 220,000 mu [approx. 36,000 acres]. In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau was established, initially setting up two plants, east and west, in the Jiulonggang mining area. Each plant opened two vertical shafts. Although the current daily output is only over 1,000 tons, the coal reserves are substantial. The coalfield has ten coal seams, with a total thickness of up to twelve meters. The abundance of reserves is rare in the country. According to the Bureau's authorities, experts estimate that the Jiulonggang mining area has reserves of 71.7 million tons of coal, and the Dongshan mining area has reserves of 43.7 million tons of coal, totaling 115.4 million tons in both areas. Assuming that the undiscovered coal reserves are half of this figure, the total amount of coal in the coalfield is 173.1 million tons. Furthermore, assuming that only 30% of the total coal reserves are mineable, the mineable coal reserves of the Huainan Mine should be at least 50 million tons, which is truly astonishing. The coal quality is high-flame bituminous coal, suitable for low-temperature coking and oil refining. If mixed with a small amount of low-flame bituminous coal, it can be refined into good metallurgical coke. Its endowment is exceptionally rich, and its location is uniquely advantageous. Among all the mines in the country, it is truly rare to find a match. In terms of coal quality, its calorific value is comparable only to that of Fushun; in terms of location, its distance from the Yangtze River is less than half that of Zhongxing; in terms of reserves, Kailuan cannot claim sole credit; and in terms of transportation, once the dedicated railway is open to traffic, it will directly reach the Yangtze River. The convenience of water and land transportation will be unparalleled. Subsequently, the cost of transportation will be reduced, and it is hoped that extremely cheap fuel will promote the development of domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce, and make contributions to national defense and heavy industry. It is not only a success for this one mine, but also a great success for the country's basic construction.</p>
<p>The Huainan Coal Mine has the advantages of excellent coal quality, abundant reserves, and suitable location. It can be asserted that it will become a large mine. In the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the Construction Commission appointed Dr. Cheng Zhiyi as the Director of the Bureau. Director Cheng recognized that foreign coal was flooding the market and domestic coal was being rejected. He knew that it would be futile to not find ways to reduce costs, facilitate transportation, expand mining equipment to increase production, and increase sales equipment to facilitate sales. He actively planned expansion and spared no effort. Currently, a 12-kilometer light railway has been laid from the mine to the Luo River (a tributary of the Huai River), equipped with dozens of large and small locomotives and coal cars. The waterway from the Luo River to Bengbu is also equipped with dozens of steamers, gasoline boats, and iron barges dedicated to transportation. In terms of sales, coal yards have been set up in Luohe, Bengbu, and Pukou. In June of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], due to the need for cooperation with the neighboring Datong Mine in the sales area of the Huai and Wo River basins, a joint sales office for the two mines was established in Bengbu. In Nanjing, a Xiaguan office was set up to represent the mine bureau and handle sales, transportation, and other matters. In addition, because the coal along the Jinpu Railway is all sold to the Yangtze River basin, with Pukou as the terminal for land transportation, the railway wharf in Pukou has no space to store large quantities of coal. Marketing is greatly difficult for all mines. Therefore, Zhongxing, Lieshan, Huadong, Huafeng, and Datong collectively agreed to invest in the organization of a public warehouse dock company with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. The mine's share accounts for one-eighth of the total. The company has now been established, and the dock address has been determined. Construction will begin after the design work is completed.</p>
<p>Before the production of the Huainan Mine expands to 2,000 tons per day, the transportation problem is extremely important. At the beginning of the establishment of the Huainan Mine, the Construction Commission surveyed and prepared to build a railway from the mine to the opposite bank of Wuhu. The southern section of the Jinpu Railway is known for its congestion of passengers and goods. In addition, the coal mines along the line rely on the railway as a transportation facility. Under the current situation, the allocation of railway vehicles is already difficult. If the Huainan Mine further increases production, the railway transportation will be even more difficult to handle. In addition, the loading and unloading of coal is frequent, which is extremely costly and affects sales. In order to facilitate the future development of Huainan coal and assist in the transportation of the Huai River and Yangtze River basins, the Huainan Railway is being actively constructed. The entire line is 215 kilometers long and passes through various counties with extremely rich agricultural products and industrial raw materials. This railway started construction in April of this year [1934] and will first complete the section from the mine to Hefei, which is 87 kilometers long. The cost of road construction and equipment is estimated to be about 1.78 million yuan. Most of the earthwork has been completed, and bridge construction will begin soon. It can be opened to traffic by the end of this year, and it is expected to be extended to Chaoxian in the summer of next year. The entire line is expected to be open to traffic within one year.</p>
<p>This month, the 5th is the fourth anniversary of the mine, and the entire roadbed section of the Huainan Railway's mine-joint section has been completed. Therefore, it is planned to hold the fourth anniversary celebration and the railway foundation-laying ceremony at the mine bureau on that day. It is heard that Zhang Jingjiang, a member of the Central Committee and Chairman of the National Government's Construction Commission, will personally preside over the foundation-laying ceremony. The Construction Commission has sent invitations to representatives from various ministries and commissions of the Central Government and various local party, government, military, and police agencies and organizations to participate. The Bureau has begun preparations for this commemorative ceremony. In addition to setting up reception centers in Bengbu and Luohe, on that day, if guests take the Jinpu train north from Pukou (or south from the north), there will be special trains and ships to and from Bengbu to Luohe and from Luohe to the mine. The entire bureau will be open for guests to visit. After the ceremony, there will be recreational activities to add to the fun. At that time, the mining area will be decorated with colorful arches and filled with guests. The atmosphere will be magnificent and reach its peak for a time.</p>
<h3>Salt Smugglers' Riot in Shandong: Looting of Salt Fields and Encirclement of Tax Police Station; The Disturbance is Related to People's Livelihood Issues</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In various parts of eastern Shandong, people have suddenly gathered to riot and loot salt. The reason is nothing more than the difficulties of people's livelihood and the high price of salt, which have led to this. This is truly a problem worthy of attention. Previously, thousands of rioters rioted and looted salt in the Jiaolai area at night. Fortunately, the Salt Transport Envoy's Office dispatched police to suppress the riot overnight, and it was quelled. Li Zhifan, the Salt Transport Envoy and Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, has now arrived in Qingdao from Jinan to inspect the situation after the Jiaozhou salt fields were looted. Who knew that one wave had not subsided, and another wave rose again. At 12:00 midnight on the 2nd of this month, a salt smuggling riot suddenly broke out at the Liyutan Salt Field near Xiaying Town in the northwest of Yexian County. More than 400 salt smugglers and rioters surrounded the tax police station. The two sides exchanged gunfire for five hours until dawn on the 3rd, when the rioters dispersed. After receiving the report, the Salt Transport Envoy's Office telegraphed the county for protection and reported everything to the Ministry of Finance. This morning (4th), Zhang Jinzhang, the assistant of the Salt Transport Envoy's Office, described the incident as follows:</p>
<p>Liyutan in Yexian County is the largest salt field in eastern Shandong, with an annual output of 500,000 dan [approx. 50,000 tons]. Salt for eighteen counties, including Fushan, Qixia, Laiyang, and Penglai, is supplied by this field. The salt field is stationed with dozens of tax police officers. At 12:00 midnight on the 2nd, suddenly more than 400 rioters, mostly private salt dealers, surrounded the tax police station and demanded that they surrender their guns. The tax police resisted, and the rioters opened fire. The tax police also fired to defend themselves. The two sides exchanged gunfire for five hours until dawn on the 3rd, when the rioters dispersed. Two people were arrested. The casualties have not yet been confirmed. However, when the artillery fire was at its height, the other rioters looted the salt field. After the investigation, the losses were huge. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the salt field telegraphed the Salt Transport Envoy's Office and the Tax Police Bureau to report the incident and requested instructions on how to deal with the aftermath. After receiving the telegram, the Salt Transport Envoy's Office telegraphed a reply to the county government to severely punish the captured rioters. It also telegraphed the Special Task Force stationed in Gudidian, Weixian County, to rush to the defense overnight. Today (4th), it telegraphed Liu Guobin, the magistrate of Yexian County, to send the militia and public security bureau to the salt field for protection. The tax police in the salt field are now strictly arresting the ringleaders to eliminate hidden dangers. The Salt Transport Envoy's Office also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report the details of the incident. In recent days, salt looting disturbances have occurred frequently in the province. The reasons are: (1) After the fall of the three northeastern provinces, the people of Dong County were driven back to their hometowns and had no way to make a living. They took the risk. Moreover, the countryside was destroyed, and the farmers had no way to make a living. Therefore, they took advantage of the salt drying season to gather crowds to loot, sell, and make a living. (2) The salt tax is too heavy, and the price of salt is expensive. Buyers find that buying private salt is much cheaper than official salt. Therefore, they dare to buy private salt, and private sales are rampant, which is the biggest cause of salt looting disturbances. In view of the two incidents, the Salt Transport Envoy's Office will send a letter to the provincial government to instruct the salt-producing counties to instruct the district, township, and town chiefs to earnestly inform the villagers not to violate the law and harm themselves. The magistrates of each county should strictly protect each salt field at all times (4th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Stored Grain in Warehouses is Being Replaced with New Grain</h3>
<p>Our county previously received an order from the province to organize a Warehouse Management Committee to collect funds for grain storage through taxation on farmland and purchase 2,000 shi [approx. 200 tons] of white rice. It has been three years since then. Recently, with the time approaching the lean season and the price of rice gradually rising, the committee convened a regular meeting yesterday to discuss ways to replace the old grain with new grain. It was decided that although the white rice stored in the warehouse is clean and dry and not damaged, it has been three years. According to the tenth article, third item of the Warehouse Management Rules regarding the entry and exit of warehouse grain and the method of replacing the old with new, and the seventeenth article of the detailed rules, in case of a lean season, the regulations for using warehouse grain may be formulated according to the circumstances. It is proposed that (1) Loan: The district chief of the grain loan area, together with three or more wealthy people in the district, shall apply to the committee for grain loan and declare responsibility for repayment. After the committee verifies that it can be guaranteed and submits it to the county for approval, the grain shall be loaned, and after the autumn harvest, eight sheng [approx. 1 liter] of grain shall be added as interest and two sheng as loss per dan [approx. 100 liters] for transportation and returned to the warehouse. If it is not returned by the deadline, the county shall be requested to strictly pursue it. (2) Fair price: The committee shall convene a meeting of all committee members and district chiefs to discuss and decide on the implementation. Afterwards, the principal of the sales shall be recovered and temporarily deposited for interest. When the price of grain is low, it shall be purchased to replenish it. Regarding the above two items, which one should be chosen to be implemented so that poor households can benefit from it? It was decided that, for the purpose of replacing the old rice with new rice, a small amount of rice should be sold at a fair price in front of the committee's east warehouse to benefit the poor. The committee shall send a letter to the county to request the Department of Civil Affairs to approve the implementation.</p>
<h3>Qingpu: District Chief Stops Lantern Parade, Causing Unprecedented Disputes</h3>
<p>In Zhujiajiao Town, Qingpu County, on the 31st of last month, a lantern parade was held to promote the New Life Movement. It was forcibly stopped by the town's district chief, Wang Yingzhong, which aroused public anger, resulting in unprecedented changes such as the destruction of the district office, the public security sub-bureau, and the district chief's private residence. Details were reported in the Shen and Xin newspapers. In order to clarify the truth, we are re-recording it below:</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in Nanchang, various places have responded and vigorously promoted it. Activities such as masquerade parades and lantern parades were quite popular for a while. The town's party and government agencies also led people from all walks of life to hold propaganda meetings on April 21st and 22nd to promote it. The people from all walks of life further expanded the propaganda and held lantern parades for three days from the 29th to the 31st of last month. The lantern parades were able to maintain order, and the lively situation was unprecedented in decades. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the second day (30th), the first sub-bureau of the town's public security suddenly took action to stop the lantern parade on the third day. People from all walks of life were deeply puzzled and inquired about the reason from the sub-bureau. According to Mr. Jin of the bureau, it was District Chief Wang Yingzhong who telegraphed to stop it. People from all walks of life then asked several friends of the district chief to meet with the district chief at his private residence to request permission to continue for one day. The district chief said that the prohibition of the lantern parade on the 31st was his intention, and his decision had been made. Even if the county magistrate came, he would not compromise. They did not get the key point, so they went out and gently persuaded the people to avoid trouble. However, at about 2:00 p.m. on the 31st, the general public thought that the lantern parade was originally legitimate, and the bureau had no reason to forcibly prohibit it. However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, they changed to an open space to gather and set off. When passing by the town's City God Temple, the public security sub-bureau, led by Mr. Jin, suddenly detained the most magnificent Zhongshan Pavilion in the lantern parade with ten armed police officers. Then, the two sides began to argue. The police officers said that they were executing orders and could not let it go. At that time, because it was difficult to maintain order, the Zhongshan Pavilion also collapsed to the ground at this time. The lantern parade participants and the audience were all angry and destroyed the doors and windows. At that time, a police officer shouted that it was District Chief Wang's intention, not ours, to prohibit the lantern parade. The crowd, hearing this, rushed to the district office again, intending to find the district chief to reason with. He had not yet arrived. One or two brave men broke into the district office and destroyed the chairs and tables. They also found that the district chief was hiding at home and went to his private residence. The district chief, hearing the noise, immediately pulled out a box cannon in front of the window, intending to shoot at the crowd. The crowd, seeing this situation, was even more furious and broke into the house. They immediately disarmed the district chief of his guns and ammunition and were about to reason with him. Unexpectedly, the district chief took the opportunity to escape through the back door, first to the toilet, and then from the toilet to a neighbor's house. At that time, the crowd could not find him and were extremely angry. They ignored everything and destroyed the items in the house until about 4:00 p.m., when they dispersed. After this serious incident occurred, the county government and the county public security bureau had received telephone reports and immediately sent a police team to the town to suppress the riot and arrested people along the way. When Qian Jiaxiang, the county magistrate, arrived in the town in person at 6:00 p.m., he had arrested 27 people and said that there were other perpetrators hiding in Jingting Township in Kunshan County. He then cooperated with the local public security substation to arrest Yin Hongda and 13 others at their addresses and sent them to the bureau. Qian Jiaxiang, the county magistrate, personally interrogated them until dawn. They were transferred to the county in two batches. The next day, District Chief Wang, holding a Mauser pistol and escorted by the police, acted as if he was facing a formidable enemy and went out to arrest people door to door. The atmosphere was tense, and people were very uneasy. District Chief Wang even declared that all those who participated in the lantern parade would be arrested. As a result, people in the town were panicked, and there were few pedestrians. Villagers also hesitated to come, lest they be wrongly accused. Therefore, merchants have been cautious in recent days. It is heard that all circles in the town believe that this incident was entirely caused by the district chief. Therefore, they have presented the details to the provincial and county authorities and requested the release of innocent people and the reassurance of the people. It is also heard that the gentry and merchants in Shanghai will also telegraph the provincial and county authorities to severely punish the district chief. Therefore, this case may be expanded.</p>
<h3>Nanhui: County Education Bureau Director Sworn into Office</h3>
<p>Yang Binru, the director of the County Education Bureau, held a swearing-in ceremony in the bureau's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th. More than 200 representatives and guests from various agencies attended. Yuan Xiluo, the county magistrate appointed by the Department of Education, presided over the swearing-in ceremony.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Murder Cases Occur Frequently in the Four Townships</h3>
<p>Recently, murder cases have occurred frequently in the four townships of our county. Since the murder case in the eighth district, four more cases have been discovered one after another. (1) A petty thief named Sun Xiaoshun went to Shijiaqiao in the sixth district to steal from a farmer named Shi Zupei. He was beaten to death by Shi. (2) A farmer named Qian Jin in the fourth district was addicted to alcohol. Every time he drank, he would get drunk. The day before yesterday, he went home drunk and had a conflict with Qian Afu. Then, they fought each other. Qian Jin was old and weak and fell to the ground and died. (3) Zhang Genfu's wife, who lived outside the east gate of the city in Meiyuan Township, was extremely fierce. Because of a trivial matter, she had a quarrel with her daughter-in-law, Zhu, and forced her to hang herself. (4) Hu Ahu, a farmer in Xinjing Township in the eighth district, shared a mistress with his clan uncle. Because of jealousy and adultery, Ahu was strangled to death by his clan uncle with a rope and buried in the old mud pond of Zhuang Jilou in an attempt to eliminate the evidence. However, the matter was not kept secret and was reported. Yesterday (5th), the county government appointed Shen Cheng, an investigator, to go to the township with the newly appointed coroner, Wang Guirong, to inspect the body. The murderer has been arrested and brought to justice. The former coroner, Lu, was dismissed and imprisoned by the county because he was accused by the town chief, Zhu Ting, of accepting bribes in the Chen Ajin case. It is heard that Lu accepted a bribe of 20 yuan from the murderer when he inspected Sun Xiaoshun's body, and accepted a bribe of 30 yuan from the murderer when he inspected Qian Jin's body, falsely reporting old injuries. The county government has combined the cases for investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Verdict Reached on the Offender Who Stabbed Sun Yaoshan to Death</h3>
<p>Sun Yaoshan, the small owner of Sun Wanxing Sugar Shop on the South City Riverbank, was stabbed to death by a carpenter named Zhong Xiaoheshang in front of Kunshan Grand Theater at 2:00 p.m. on April 28th of last year. Zhong immediately fled and disappeared. The county government repeatedly ordered a strict arrest. It was not until mid-May of this year that Wu Shaokang, the leader of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, arrested Zhong in Shanghai and brought him back to Kunshan and sent him to the county government for legal action. After repeated interrogations by the investigator, Zhang Yizhi, the offender confessed that Sun said that I was having an affair with his mistress, and the knife was brought by Sun to kill me. At that time, Sun stabbed at me fiercely with the knife. Seeing the fierce attack, I blocked it upwards with my arm, causing Sun to stab himself in the neck and die. I did not intend to kill him. At 3:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th, Zhang, the investigator, brought Zhong Xiaoheshang forward and sentenced him to 15 years of imprisonment. It is heard that Zhong does not accept the judgment and wants to appeal to the High Court.</p>
<h3>Two Children Hang Themselves on a Tree, One Dies, One Lives</h3>
<p>In the open space of Zhujing Village outside the southeast gate of our county, there is an ancient tree that is large enough to be embraced by several people. On the 3rd, a child was playing under the tree when he suddenly untied his belt and hanged himself on the tree. After being seen by someone, he rushed forward and saved him. The child was revived. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Gao Wenqin's son, Rongsheng, who was only twelve years old, was passing by the tree when he suddenly hung himself on the tree with a belt. After being seen by someone, he rushed forward to save him, but he had been dead for a long time.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Xiangchang's Home in Qizishan is Robbed</h3>
<p>Qizishan, which is seven or eight li [approx. 2.5 miles] away from Mudu Town, has been a popular place for incense and is also a scenic spot. At about 3:00 a.m. yesterday (6th), more than 20 bandits suddenly came from the direction of Shihhu and bound the family of Xiangchang in Tieqiaozai Qizishan, forcing them to reveal where they had hidden silver. They robbed them of about several hundred yuan worth of cash, gold jewelry, and clothes, and also robbed them of a rifle, a Fengwei gun, and a sleeve gun that were stored by the security team, and fled in the direction of Fengqiao.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Monk Hai Rong of Shilin Temple Accused of Adultery</h3>
<p>Shilin Temple in the east of the city is one of the large Buddhist monasteries in Suzhou. Hai Rong, the younger brother of the abbot Guangyue, is 25 years old. Although he has entered the Buddhist temple, he loves to dress up, travels in and out by chartered car, and is quite wealthy. Huang, the wife of Wang Fusheng, a housekeeper on Pingjiang Road, who is nearby, is also 25 years old and has some beauty. Because of poverty, she sells vegetables for a living and sometimes enters the temple. Yesterday (6th) morning, Wang Fusheng suddenly went to the No. 11 branch of the Public Security Bureau on Lindun Road and accused Hai Rong of adultery with his wife Wang Huang. The police were dispatched to the temple to arrest Hai Rong and the woman and send them to the branch for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chambers of Commerce in Various Places Petition the Provincial Government Against Changing the Name of the Merchant Corps</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Security Office previously ordered all counties to reorganize the merchant corps in each county. Those with obligatory nature should postpone the change of name, while those with employed nature should be reorganized into independent detachments of the local defense corps and be subject to the command and dispatch of the local defense corps headquarters. Therefore, the chambers of commerce in each county paid close attention to this. The merchant corps in various places, such as Xuhai, have been assisting the local military and police in maintaining local security for many years and have been quite effective. It seems inappropriate to change the name. Therefore, representatives from the chambers of commerce in various places were sent to the provincial government and the provincial security office to petition the day before yesterday. Shi Junqing, chairman of the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, and Cheng Ganqing, a member of the standing committee, were both elected as petition representatives. Now, Shi and Cheng have returned to Suzhou from the province. It is said that there are three main points in this petition: (1) Obligatory members shall not change their names; (2) Employed members shall be changed to Class A detachments of the merchant corps, and all officers shall be elected by the chamber of commerce; (3) Military and police agencies in various places shall not dispatch merchant corps. The result of the petition was satisfactory. The provincial authorities agreed to consider the points of the petition and may accommodate them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Spring Cocoons Arrive in Large Quantities at High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the opening of the cocoon market. Cocoons arrived from various parts of the city and the countryside. The price has increased to over 40 yuan. Therefore, silkworm farmers have sold their cocoons in succession. The harvest of this year's spring cocoons is very good. Each silkworm stand can produce more than 80 jin [approx. 40 kg] of cocoons. The drying rate is better than in previous years. Yesterday (6th), the cocoon prices in various rural areas were: Miaoqiao 40 yuan, Yangting, Sitou, Lishe, Shituowan, Beiqifang, Huangshijie, etc., high-quality cocoons 35 yuan. The cocoon prices in the urban areas of Qingming Bridge, Zhoushanbang, etc. were lower than in the rural areas. The deadline for cocoon collection is one week to ten days before it can be completed.</p>
<h3>Suspect Arrested for Arson</h3>
<p>Fires have occurred frequently inside and outside the city in recent days. Most of them started from the main entrance or the back door. The fire brigades were exhausted, and the losses of the victims were even greater. The cause of the fires was that bandits set fire to take advantage of the chaos and rob. The public security authorities are paying attention to investigating and arresting them. Yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of Sun Renrong's house in Beicangmen outside the east gate. His mother, Shen, was alerted and shouted for help. Sun Xu, who lived next door, also heard the noise and came out to see. He found three suspicious people and immediately arrested one of them and handed him over to the police on duty to take him to the second branch of the Public Security Bureau. After being interrogated by Director Gao, he confessed that his name was Huang Ada, from Mazhen, Jiangyin. The rest of his words were extremely cunning. The fire brigades and the joint association have sent letters to the county government requesting legal action.</p>
<h3>Disturbance Occurs in the Jintan Cocoon Market</h3>
<p>There were originally 27 old-style cocoon markets in Jintan County. Since the implementation of the unified control this year, all of them have been abolished. Instead, Xue Shouxuan and other silk magnates from Wuxi jointly invested with the old cocoon merchants of the county to build four new-style cocoon markets with very complete equipment. Now, the cocoon markets are open to collect cocoons. Because there are few cocoon markets, the cocoon price can be restricted. It is expected to be only 25 or 26 yuan. The villagers clashed because it was not enough to cover the cost, causing all four cocoon markets to be destroyed. Now, the Jintan County Government has telegraphed the province to send security teams to Jintan to suppress the riot. The disturbance has not yet subsided.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Yang Qingjiu, the Captain of the Water Patrol Team, to be Escorted to the Province for Disposal</h3>
<p>Yang Qingjiu, the captain of the 8th Water Public Security Team stationed in Changshu, was accused by Wang Jinming and other bandits captured in Xiaoxian County of having contact with bandits in Jiangbei. The provincial government ordered Wei Zhanyuan, the director of the Second District, to suspend Yang from his duties and place him under surveillance. He is now detained in the district headquarters in Suzhou. However, people in Suzhou and Changshu, because Yang has been stationed for many years and his merits outweigh his faults, have sent telegrams to the provincial government, declaring that he has been framed and explaining on his behalf. However, in order to clarify the facts, the provincial government sent personnel to investigate and telegraphed back to various legal groups, saying that Captain Yang was suspended from his duties and placed under surveillance by the district headquarters because he was accused by the captured bandit Wang Jinming of colluding with bandits. He should be verified after confronting the bandit Wang. According to Suzhou news, Yang is still free while being detained in the district headquarters. Director Wei will escort Yang to the province on the 6th to await disposal. However, the banking and money industry association of the county jointly presented a petition to the provincial government to rescue Yang.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: County Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Dismissed</h3>
<p>The Provincial Party Headquarters' Executive Committee, based on accusations from Sun ShaoChen and others, members of the Jiangyin Second District Party, alleged that Xu PingHua, the County Party Supervisory Committee member, frequented prostitutes, contracted venereal disease, and received treatment at the Gospel Hospital. Additionally, it was alleged that Gu Di, an Executive Committee member, went to Wuxi with the local prostitute Wei XiuZhi, stayed overnight at the QiTai Inn for illicit relations, and smoked opium, damaging the Party's reputation. The Provincial Party Headquarters dispatched Hu ZunYi to investigate, which confirmed the allegations. Upon his return to the province and submission of his report, a meeting was held on the second day of the month, resolving to dismiss both Xu PingHua and Gu Di. Tang KeSheng was appointed to fill the Executive Committee vacancy. Furthermore, Chen DaSan, the General Affairs Assistant, and Chen YaYi, the Propaganda Secretary, were also dismissed due to their habits. The relevant orders were received by the County Party Headquarters on the fourth day.</p>
<h3>Land Survey Report Total</h3>
<p>The land survey in Cheng County was completed by the end of May. Originally, there were 984,592.28 mu of grain-taxed farmland and 229,405.72 mu of silted farmland. After this survey, it was found that 415.18 mu of grain-taxed farmland had been requisitioned (the amount of land requisitioned for Zhencheng Road in the fifth district and Chengxi Road in the eleventh district was not reported). There were also 38,410.85 mu of collapsed silted farmland, 4,782.36 mu of unassessed grain-taxed farmland, and 23,949.03 mu of silted farmland. County Magistrate Bao was summoned to the provincial capital by telegram from the Finance Department on the fourth day to attend a meeting to revise the collection system, improve the serial tickets, and discuss agricultural banks collecting taxes on behalf of the government.</p>
<h3>Increased Production of New Cocoons</h3>
<p>The cocoon businesses in this county uniformly opened for business on the fifth day. The price for improved varieties was around 25 or 26 yuan. The goods have not yet surged. There are more than 30 cocoon businesses open, but most are dealing with surplus cocoons. Only three businesses, Lisheng, Hengyi, Gonghe, and Maochang, have received orders from cocoon merchants. This year's cocoon season is very good. The quantity of fresh cocoons is about 20 percent higher than last year's output, estimated to be 18,691 dan. Each improved district sent one person to the countryside to investigate the quantity of fresh cocoons at each cocoon business in order to collect the improvement fee after drying. However, sericulturists who purchased mulberry leaves mostly lost money because cocoon prices were too low.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Villager Murdered</h3>
<p>Wu GuiXin, a villager from the MuHangTou Township of the Second District, in his thirties, did not engage in honest work and associated with petty criminals. On the night of the third day of the month, Wu was suddenly murdered by someone on the BeiDa Road in MuHangTou. His head was split open, and his chest and abdomen were cut open. Yesterday, the fourth day, the local public security sub-bureau reported the case to the county government. This morning, the fifth day, Deng, the examining magistrate, went to conduct an autopsy and confirmed that he had been murdered before his death. He ordered the family to collect the body for burial and to investigate the case and apprehend the murderer.</p>

They are stationed in their respective sections to perform supervisory duties, preparing daily reports to be sent to the department for review. At the same time, Secretary Shen Zhang, Section Chief Wu ShiLin, and Shen Che, the Director of the Highway Management Office, are dispatched to inspect the project conditions on each road at the end of each month, report on the progress achievements, and determine rewards and punishments based on the assessment.</p>
<h3>Fire on Ximen Main Street in Broad Daylight</h3>
<p>At No. 51 Ximen Main Street, at the entrance of Tang Liu Alley, the BuPu TongHe Pharmacy, opened by merchant Pu Bin, previously had an incident where apprentices were joining the shop and lighting large incense sticks and candles for the apprenticeship celebration. The candle flowers fell and ignited accumulated firewood. Fortunately, the fire was quickly extinguished and did not cause a disaster. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the fifth day, at 4:00 PM, while Pu Bin was in the shop attending to apprentices preparing moxa floss, he instructed the apprentices to stand up straight. Suddenly, he saw a blaze of fire in the back. He immediately shouted for help. Various fire brigades and fire departments rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and began to extinguish the fire. At that time, the wind was strong, and in an instant, more than ten neighboring shops, including a tea and snack shop, a cigarette shop, a clothing store, and a wheelwright shop across the street, were burned down. It is said that the total losses of each shop amount to tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>Giant Snake Attacks Person on Majia Mountain</h3>
<p>The Majia Mountain area, located about ten li south of the Zhenyi city, is an important route for travel between XinNong and Dantu towns, and is crowded with pedestrians throughout the day. Unexpectedly, at dusk on the fifth day, a large snake, about ten feet long and as thick as a bowl, was suddenly discovered. Its body was yellowish-gray, and its scales gleamed. A nearby farmer, Lei DaFa, happened to be passing by and did not pay attention, stepping on the snake's body. As a result, he was coiled several times by the snake and bitten in several places. Later, a passerby with a lamp came by. The snake, seeing the light, quickly fled. The farmer, due to severe poisoning, collapsed to the ground unconscious. He was carried to his home, where he was able to recount the incident. However, his whole body is swollen, and there is concern for his life.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Twelve Wharf Merchants Thank Wang BoLing</h3>
<p>Wang BoLing, a member of the Central Executive Committee, was previously recommended by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to go to Nanjing to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance on the issue of four-shore sail transport. Regarding the short-term solution, a method was immediately discussed. The long-term solution is currently being discussed back and forth with Minister Kong, and it is rumored that it can also be completely resolved within days. More than 200,000 employees across the wharf are deeply grateful. They specially made a soft plaque with the four characters "Ze Run Yan Li" (Benefit the Salt People), a silver cauldron engraved with "Quan Wei Meng Hu" (Blessings for the Entire Wharf), and four silk banners embroidered with sixteen characters: "Wan Jia Sheng Fo" (Living Buddha of Ten Thousand Families), "Si An Jiu Xing" (Savior of the Four Shores), "Jiang Huai Bao Zhang" (Guardian of the JiangHuai Region), and "Dang Guo Gan Cheng" (Pillar of the Party and State). This morning, they sent representatives to Yangzhou to deliver the plaque and cauldron directly to Wang's residence in Xiama Mountain to express their gratitude.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Capture of Remaining Eastern Bandit Leader</h3>
<p>Tang YunShan, the remaining eastern bandit leader who kidnapped Shi JiMin and others for ransom, had his accomplices Yu DingZiKui and others arrested and executed. On the fifth day, Tang was captured by the Fourth District Tax Police for a private salt case and sent to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Strange Lawsuit Between Father-in-Law and Son-in-Law Concluded</h3>
<p>Huang AiLiao from Lüsi sued his father-in-law, Chen ChangYan, in court, alleging that Chen ChangYan had an incestuous relationship with his fiancée, Chen HuanBao, who became pregnant, had an abortion, and died. Chen strongly argued that his adopted daughter was kidnapped by sea bandits, raped and became pregnant, and died after escaping back home and having a miscarriage. After Wang, the prosecutor, opened the coffin for examination, the case was announced on the fifth day. It was confirmed that Chen's daughter had died from a miscarriage during her lifetime. As for the accusation of father-daughter incest, it requires a complaint to be filed. Since the deceased Chen HuanXian and Huang AiQing were not married, Huang AiQing's complaint is not legally valid and does not need to be considered further. Chen ChangYan's crime is insufficient, and he will not be prosecuted. The sensational lawsuit between the father-in-law and son-in-law in the entire county has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Meeting Record of SanMen Bay JianBa District Reclamation Company</h3>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to build the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, in addition to borrowing 3.5 million yuan from the National Economic Commission and the Sino-British Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Board of Trustees, also signed a 2 million yuan loan with five Shanghai banks, including Zhejiang Industrial, China, Communications, China Industrial, and Siming Banks. It was stipulated that funds would be released according to the progress of the railway bridge project, with an annual interest rate of 1%. The entire property and income of the bridge, as well as 1.32 million yuan in face value of Zhejiang's old debt consolidation bonds and 560,000 yuan in Zhejiang Provincial Treasury Notes, were pledged as collateral. The loan is to be repaid in ten years, starting from the third year, with principal repayment. The first two years are for interest payments only. A reporter from the XinSheng News Agency inquired with the lending banks yesterday. The first tranche was released to the construction engineering association organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Government earlier this month, totaling 300,000 yuan. It is reported that the second tranche is scheduled to be released in early December, with a total of five tranches to be released.</p>
<h3>Huang NaiShu Returns Home After Attending the Universal Postal Congress; States That Many of Our Proposals Were Passed; Will Take Up New Position in Beijing After Completing Report</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that Mr. Huang NaiShu, former Director-General of the Post Office, was dispatched abroad last year to attend the Universal Postal Congress in Egypt. He then traveled to various countries in Europe and America to inspect their postal conditions. He has now completed his duties and arrived in Shanghai on the Hoover, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Company, on the fourth day. He is currently compiling a report on his trip and will go to Beijing to meet with Minister Zhu and take up his new position as Director of the Postal Department. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Huang at the Post Office on the morning of the sixth day to inquire about his trip. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Attending the Universal Postal Congress</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, the Universal Postal Congress is held every five years to discuss and amend the Universal Postal Convention. This time, the meeting was held in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, and opened on February 1st and closed on March 20th, lasting approximately 50 days. The revision of the Universal Postal Convention and the increase or decrease of postal rates in various countries were discussed in detail and have been decided, to be implemented on January 1st next year. The representatives from our side were Hu ShiZe, Zhang XinHai, and himself. Many of the proposals we submitted were passed by the conference. The details will be announced after reporting to Minister Zhu. As for the issue of Japan instigating the puppet organization in the Northeast to seize postal affairs, it was not brought up for discussion at the conference.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Postal Services in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang continued to say that after the Universal Postal Congress closed, he went to various countries in Europe and America to inspect their postal conditions. In Europe, he visited Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, England, and Austria. In the Americas, he visited Canada and the United States. He conducted inspections along the way. Due to time constraints, he was unable to conduct detailed investigations. Based on what he gained from this inspection, he felt that transportation was convenient and equipment was excellent in European and American countries, making it easier for postal services to develop. As for other advantages suitable for foreign countries, he should study whether they are also applicable to our country. He is currently collecting his opinions and compiling them into a report for the authorities to adopt.</p>
<h3>Compiling Report in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Because of this trip to three continents, including the Philippines, Europe, and the Americas, it took five and a half months. After returning from the long trip, he plans to rest in Shanghai for a few days. During this rest period, he will compile the report on attending the Universal Postal Congress and inspecting the postal services of various countries. It is difficult to decide when to go to Beijing. Moreover, when inspecting various countries in Europe and America, due to time and travel constraints, he was unable to conduct detailed inspections of every place he passed, so he left written documents to inquire in those places. These reply documents are still on the way. Therefore, the compilation of the report will only be completed after all of these documents have been delivered. As for his taking up the new position of Director of the Postal Department, it must wait until after meeting with Minister Zhu in Beijing to determine the exact date. Mr. Huang finally added that the issue of moving the Post Office Headquarters to Beijing is still difficult to realize, because the new bureau buildings in Beijing have not yet been completed. It is also understood that Mr. Huang will return to his hometown of Hangzhou within days.</p>
<h3>Li LieJun Returns to Shanghai After Traveling; Weary from a Month-Long Journey in Shandong</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Mr. Li LieJun traveled to Shandong last month and met with Feng YuXiang, traveling with him to various scenic spots in Jiaodong. After a month-long journey, he returned tired. After personally escorting Feng back to Mount Tai a few days ago, he took the China Merchants Bureau's PuAn wheel to Shanghai on the fifth day. The ship arrived at the China Merchants Bureau's Huazhan Wharf in Pudong at 1:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Li and his entourage crossed the river and landed, returning to his residence on Masnan Road at 2:30 PM for rest. Due to the fatigue of the journey, Mr. Li declined to meet guests. According to those around him, this trip was purely a private trip and there were no other tasks involved.</p>
<h3>Part of Chinese Cotton Mills to Suspend Production; Most Have Implemented Wage and Work Hour Reductions; Plan to Submit Petitions to Authorities for Assistance</h3>
<p>According to a report from the XinSheng News Agency, Chinese cotton mills have suffered even greater losses since the market decline and the rise in raw cotton prices. Although market prices rebounded the previous week, they have continued to plummet recently. At the same time, the upward trend in raw cotton prices has not decreased, so the cost has been rising daily. A reporter from the XinSheng News Agency learned from industry insiders yesterday that some cotton mills will suspend production, and some have already implemented wage and work hour reductions. It is also reported that the cotton mills are planning to submit petitions to the authorities requesting assistance. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Difficult to Pass the Summer Festival, Production Suspension Implemented</h3>
<p>It is said that there are many reasons for the decline of the cotton industry. The current situation is even more difficult to describe, and the future is precarious. There is no good strategy to save it. If this continues, unpredictable losses will be incurred. However, cotton yarn is one of the important industries in our country. If it is allowed to go bankrupt, the market will inevitably be occupied by foreign goods. Therefore, the factories are in a situation where they are at a loss. Now that the Summer Festival (Dragon Boat Festival) is approaching, there are no funds to settle accounts. Therefore, recently, some cotton mills with weaker financial strength will suspend production before the festival to try to get through this difficulty. The date of resumption of work will depend on the situation of the market after the summer.</p>
<h3>Wage and Work Hour Reductions Mostly Implemented</h3>
<p>As for wage and work hour reductions, it is indeed the only way to remedy the decline of the cotton industry. This is because it is labor-management cooperation. The factory can avoid suspending production, and the workers can avoid unemployment. However, this matter depends entirely on whether the labor can cooperate. However, under this situation, it is inevitable and undeniable. Recently, several cotton mills have implemented wage and work hour reductions. Among them, one factory is automatic and has a spirit of labor-management cooperation. Other factories, in addition to those that have decided to temporarily suspend production before the festival, are mostly about to implement it. They are currently negotiating the methods, and it is expected that they can all be realized within days.</p>
<h3>Submit Petitions to Authorities Requesting Assistance</h3>
<p>Now the cotton industry is losing money more than the flour industry. In another month or two, even those with thick capital will not be able to bear this kind of loss, and those with weaker financial strength will find it difficult to withstand this huge loss. Therefore, in order to maintain the national industry and strive for survival, the cotton mills, at this critical moment of life and death, when they are at a loss, in addition to suspending production and reducing work hours, especially submit petitions to the authorities, requesting a detailed investigation and prompt assistance, so that the cotton industry, which is as dangerous as a pile of eggs, can get a glimmer of hope and foreign goods will be prevented from taking the opportunity to invade.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Assists Domestic Coal: Sends Personnel to Investigate Provinces</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the coal production and sales business in our country is declining day by day, unable to compete with foreign coal in the market. In order to seek assistance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially dispatched expert Chen TongZhi last month, accompanied by members of the National Coal Committee of this city, to investigate the coal production situation in Henan. It is now learned that the various committees returned to Beijing and Shanghai yesterday. A reporter interviewed a member of the National Coal Committee yesterday and learned that the opinions on assisting domestic coal are as follows:</p>
<h3>Restriction and Relief</h3>
<p>It is said that today, if we want to assist domestic coal, we must first start with restrictions. The restrictions are divided into three points: (1) restricting mine debts, (2) restricting output, and (3) restricting business areas. Under reasonable restrictions, everyone must abide by the contract, and then it can be helpful. This is related to moral heart and obligation. Only in this way can we go further to talk about assistance. Assistance is divided into three levels: (1) financial assistance, because capital has different sizes, so there are different amounts of money, and supplements should be given separately. If there are those who are in difficulty, additional assistance should be given. (2) Output assistance. Output varies in size. Some mines are large and produce a lot, while some mines are small and produce little. There is a lot of careful consideration of gains and losses between the rich and the poor. (3) Geographical assistance. Coal producing areas are different in distance, and there are differences in supply and demand. For example, there are four major coal sales areas in our country, such as Tianjin, Guangdong, Hankou, and Shanghai, because there are different distances from the coal producing areas. How should transportation be assisted? It is also a practical problem. However, no matter the money output and geography, they are all related to the situation. The situation can make manufacturers poor or rich, can make output win or lose, and can also make the geographical environment change.</p>
<h3>How to Compete</h3>
<p>There are official mines, Chinese-foreign joint ventures, and commercial mines. Although their natural interests are the same, the commercial mines seem to be slightly weaker, so there cannot be an equal opportunity for treatment. In the future, the government will seek to assist domestic coal and should strive for this point. It is like parents educating their children, doing their best to make them receive education above the horizontal line. As for whether they can develop upwards in the future, it is their own problem of progress. How is the opportunity for progress, even as the parents, they cannot give any power to promote it. The reason why coal production in our country cannot compete with others is because the business organization is upside down. When the Shanghai Concession was first opened, Japanese coal had already invaded, followed by the coal of foreign merchants, which came in continuously. At that time, our country had no railways, so there was no coal to compete with others. Now, if we talk about the way to help, first, we must strive for self-sufficiency, because if we have no goods, empty talk about resistance is useless. People in the same industry should also embrace the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, not suspecting each other, and thinking from a overall perspective and from a national point of view. In this case, foreign coal will resist itself without mentioning resistance. Otherwise, if you only pay attention to business profits and losses, and the sales market is not good, you will advocate resistance and say that it is useless.</p>
<h3>Future Investigation</h3>
<p>Real industry and commerce are aware of this, so they convened experts to start with investigation first. The investigation of Henan coal production has not yet been completed. After the 15th of this month, they plan to go again. Later, they will also go to Shanxi and Hebei provinces. However, the matter of investigation is also not easy to say. If they cannot gain the trust of people, the manufacturers will not be willing to provide their data and contribute to us, fearing that the results of the investigation will have an impact on their business. However, I am willing to base on this ambition to make the industry first able to trust, trust a lifetime, then there is no disadvantage, the way to assist domestic coal is nothing more than this.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Panchen Lama received Zhu ShaoLiang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, at the Foreign Affairs Building yesterday morning.

<p>Zhu ShaoLiang Visits</p>
<p>Zhu ShaoLiang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, went to Beijing this time to report the military and political situation in Gansu Province to the Central Government. He came to Shanghai on the way to visit relatives and seek medical treatment.

<h3>Two Organizations Telegraph: Request the Central Government to Maintain Sovereignty Over Pilotage Rights; Oppose Foreign Advisors Modifying Regulations; Earnestly Request the Government to Formulate Laws</h3>
<p>The matter of reclaiming pilotage rights has recently garnered significant attention from members of society. The Preparatory Committee of the China Pilots' Association and the General Association of Chinese Southern Ship Captains have telegraphed the Central National Government, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, etc., requesting that national defense and military authority be prioritized and that the government not be misled by foreign advisors. Yesterday, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai China Pilots' Association and the Chinese Merchant Ship Captains' Association telegraphed the General Staff Headquarters, the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan of the National Government.</p>
<p>The message to various agencies stated:</p>
<p>"Upon examining various countries in the East and West, it is evident that all have enacted separate laws and regulations for pilotage affairs to define responsibilities. In Japan, this is known as the Pilotage Law. The reason for this is that a nation's territorial waters and the foreign ships entering its ports, even to the slightest degree of anchoring, should be subject to the restrictions of the host country. This is supported by international law and is of utmost importance, not only concerning the shipping industry and commerce but also national defense and military power. Therefore, all countries solemnly handle this matter, establishing laws and regulations as permanent guiding principles. In our country, in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign (1868), Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, drafted the General Pilotage Regulations, which were submitted to the Zongli Yamen (Office for Foreign Affairs) for approval and have been implemented to this day, for sixty-seven years. This has hindered our national sovereignty and caused significant harm. The January 28th Incident, when enemy ships roamed freely, is a clear example. Last autumn, the government resolutely promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Pilotage, simultaneously abolishing the old regulations of the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign. The Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee was also established in accordance with the regulations. The people of the country praised the wise and decisive actions of the authorities, celebrating the reclamation of sovereignty. However, recent rumors have spread that foreigners claim the old regulations were derived from agreements and refuse to recognize the new regulations. Consequently, Inspector General of Customs, Frederick Maze, has proposed conditions for modifying the regulations, including requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to first consult with relevant countries. Furthermore, it is heard that the Executive Yuan has already approved these modifications to the regulations, and that the other requests have also been granted. The dissemination of these rumors has caused deep anxiety. Regardless of the content of the modifications, surrendering such significant power to foreign advisors is worse than the old regulations of the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign. Even considering only the fact that modifications are made whenever foreigners object, and that the content of the modifications originates from the Inspector General of Customs, it is clear that we are losing the power of self-determination, repeating the mistakes of the late Qing Dynasty. Moreover, the new regulations, in practice, have been implemented without any issues. Why must they be changed so quickly, completely entrusting crucial power to foreign advisors? What will become of the government's credibility? Furthermore, the so-called consultation with relevant countries by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is akin to voluntarily entering a trap without being forced, implicitly acknowledging the existence of treaty relations. Is this not the greatest blunder on the diplomatic stage? Moreover, it is heard that the modifications to the regulations include abolishing all responsibilities of the Management Committee and handing them over to foreign customs officials. Although the Management Committee is limited by circumstances and constrained by others, its fundamental organization is not merely symbolic. It can still maintain some semblance of sovereignty. If the rumors are true, and the authorities are determined to hand everything over to foreigners to their satisfaction, then does this not contradict the government's original intention of strengthening national defense and reclaiming pilotage rights, being utterly contradictory? Is it possible that our wise and decisive leaders are being misled? This is something that the affiliated associations dare not believe. Given the insatiable desires of foreigners and the need to guard against the abuse of power by foreign advisors, the fundamental principle of governing the country lies in the law. There is no other way. (Omission)... In accordance with its authority, [the government should] retrieve the original documents, conduct a detailed study according to legislative procedures, and formulate separate pilotage laws and regulations to prevent the future legislative issues from being affected by this modification of regulations. Because consular jurisdiction still exists, if any leverage is given to foreigners at this time, it will be difficult to recover it even with laws in the future. Nothing could be more detrimental to national integrity and sovereignty. It is important to remember that this matter is significant and should not be overturned merely because of the demands of foreigners. Their intentions are different from ours. The gains and losses involved are chilling to consider. Now, given the urgency of the situation, we dare to lay out the advantages and disadvantages in detail, hoping that you will understand our sincerity and grant our request, without making concessions that will lead to self-inflicted harm. National sovereignty will be fortunate, pilotage will be fortunate, China Pilots' Association Preparatory Committee, and China Merchant Ship Captains' Association respectfully submit."</p>
<h3>Nanyang Overseas Chinese, Shen Liangmu, Discusses Impressions from Inspection; Departs Today for Shantou and Hong Kong to Return to Singapore to Report</h3>
<p>Mr. Shen Liangmu, president of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese United News Agency, was entrusted by the overseas Chinese in Nanyang to return to China to inspect the news industry and the political and economic situation. After arriving in Shanghai, he went to Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places to inspect and visited party and state leaders and business leaders to exchange opinions. Now that his mission is completed, he will leave Shanghai today and go to Shantou, Hong Kong, and other places for a short period of inspection before returning to Singapore to report. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited him at the YMCA yesterday, and he graciously shared his impressions, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting National Products (Question): "Mr. Shen, what are your impressions from this inspection trip to China?" (Answer): "I have many impressions, too many to fully express in a few words. After I return to Singapore, I will publish a lengthy report in various Nanyang newspapers so that overseas Chinese can learn about the true situation of the motherland. The content will focus on the economic aspect because the economic relationship is the closest connection between overseas Chinese in Nanyang and the motherland." (Question): "What are your opinions on the issue of promoting national products in Nanyang?" (Answer): "I believe that now is an excellent opportunity to promote national products in Nanyang. Firstly, domestic labor costs are low, and secondly, the silver currency has depreciated. Currently, the currency systems used in the British and Dutch colonies in Nanyang are worth about twice the value of the national currency. For example, a product sold for one yuan in Shanghai is equivalent to about 54 cents in Straits dollars or 47 cents in Dutch guilders. Unfortunately, there are very few domestic merchants with a broad vision and the ability to expand outward, resulting in a large market dominated by Japanese goods. After I return to Nanyang, I will do my best to introduce all the products of domestic national goods factories to overseas Chinese to arouse their interest in running national goods businesses. At the same time, I hope that domestic merchants can organize an inspection team to visit various ports in Nanyang to conduct on-site market surveys."</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Investment (Question): "What are your opinions on the issue of overseas Chinese investing in the construction of the motherland?" (Answer): "Regarding this matter, I have discussed it in detail with leaders from various sectors. In my observation, it is indeed necessary for overseas Chinese to invest in the construction of the motherland, but the timing seems a bit premature. Currently, the motherland does not lack capital, but the capital is concentrated in one place, resulting in congestion in the cities and poverty in the countryside. The reason for this is that the political system is not on track, and there is social unrest in the interior. Therefore, if the government of the motherland wants overseas Chinese to invest in construction, the most important thing is to eliminate banditry, reform officialdom, and exempt all kinds of exorbitant taxes. Then, not only will overseas Chinese be happy to return to China to invest, but the industry and commerce of the motherland will also have hope of revitalization."</p>
<p>Progress of Enterprises (Question): "What are your feelings about the various enterprises in the motherland?" (Answer): "Generally speaking, various enterprises in the motherland have made great progress in recent years. Taking the news industry in Shanghai as an example, whether in terms of quality or quantity, there has been significant progress compared to five or six years ago. Unfortunately, domestic newspapers have too little news about overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Taking advantage of this inspection trip, I have contacted the authorities of various newspapers. After returning to Nanyang, I will continuously supply various</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>newspapers with news about overseas Chinese in Nanyang so that compatriots at home and abroad can communicate with each other, avoiding the isolation of the past." As the reporter asked further questions, seeing that Mr. Shen was busy packing and receiving guests, he shook hands with Mr. Shen and departed.</p>
<h3>Customs Responds to Chamber of Commerce: Improve Assessment of Export Tax for Rubber Products; Submit Evidence of Current Low Prices to Customs for Verification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Customs Superintendent's Office replied to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Regarding your letter, which stated that the Shanghai National Rubber Products Industry Association wrote to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that members are shipping goods for export, and customs assesses the value for tax purposes. Recently, market prices have fallen, so please assess the value lightly to show fairness. We hereby request your approval as requested, etc. Previously, the Association had submitted the same situation, and we had already requested the Customs to handle it. After forwarding the letter, the Customs Commissioner replied, stating that most of the rubber shoes shipped from Shanghai are products of machine factories. The dutiable value is always determined by the Customs in consultation with the relevant factories, and this is used as a guide to calculate the dutiable value of rubber shoes made by factories that do not enjoy machine factory treatment. Since the industry association believes that the current set price is too high, the Customs should consider making corresponding revisions. However, the Customs still needs to investigate the actual market conditions. It is best for the manufacturers to submit evidence of the current low prices to the Customs for reference, which is the usual procedure for such cases. We also hope that all machine factories will notify the Customs of their export value in a timely manner so that we can communicate with each other, etc. In addition to notifying the Association, we are replying accordingly, hoping you will take note."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Japan Tourist Bureau Also Sells Through-Tickets to Shenyang; However, Passengers Still Need to Change Trains at Shanhaiguan; Whether We Have Permitted This is Worth Noting</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports: "Yesterday's telegram reported that the Shenyang branch of the Japan International Tourist Bureau is selling joint passenger tickets for the pseudo-Fengshan Railway and the Beining Railway. A reporter from the New News Agency rushed to the Shanghai branch of the Tourist Bureau at No. 86 Guangdong Road to investigate the matter. Posing as a customer, the reporter asked the clerk about the price of first-class joint tickets from Shanghai to Shenyang or Tianjin to Shenyang. The clerk immediately presented a price list and explained that the first-class ticket price from Shanghai to Shenyang or from Shenyang to Shanghai is 106 yuan and 65 cents. The route is from the Jinghu Railway through Beijing, along the Jinpu Railway to Tianjin, then to Shanhaiguan, where passengers change trains to reach Shenyang directly, or from Shenyang to Shanhaiguan, where passengers change trains to Tianjin, passing through Beijing to Shanghai. The first-class ticket price from Tianjin to Shenyang or from Shenyang to Tianjin is 12 yuan and 70 cents. The route is only the section from Tianjin to Shenyang. However, whether traveling between Shanghai and Shenyang or between Tianjin and Shenyang, passengers must change trains at Shanhaiguan because direct through-train service between inside and outside the customs has not yet been established." After speaking, the clerk also asked the reporter if he wanted to buy a ticket immediately, proving that the report in the telegram that tickets are already being sold is quite accurate. At that time, the reporter further asked the clerk whether the bureau had obtained permission from the Chinese railway authorities to sell this type of ticket. The clerk immediately replied that there were no difficulties, implying that permission had already been obtained from our side. It is noted that the bureau has branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shenyang. The bureau stopped selling train tickets after the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) but has now suddenly resumed selling tickets. It remains to be seen whether this is with our permission or a unilateral action on their part, which is worth noting.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, the anti-Japanese hero, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday with his secretary, Duan Zongfan, adjutants Du Junfeng and Zhang Yuxin, and others. They are staying at a friend's place and have not checked into the Cangzhou Hotel. Yesterday, Ma, accompanied by Wu Huanzhang, the former Shanghai representative of Ma, took a car to the municipal government in the city center around ten o'clock to visit Mayor Wu.

<h3>Chen Guangfu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Mr. Chen Guangfu of the National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee has been working hard to increase cotton production and promote production and sales cooperation. In addition to going to the Northwest and Shaanxi provinces to consult with local authorities on cotton industry improvement and production and sales cooperation, he also went north after returning to Shanghai to investigate the production and sales of cotton in various regions to devise methods for improvement. At the same time, he also inspected the conditions of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank branches in various places. He has now completed his tasks and returned to Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>It is heard that the total investment of the six banks, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Kincheng Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the Four Provinces Farmers Bank of Hankou, in the Northwest Cotton Industry Improvement Association is 300,000 yuan, with each bank contributing 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Convenes Tea Merchants for Discussion the Day Before Yesterday; Discusses Ways to Counter a Certain Country's Imitation of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau, recognizing that Chinese tea in the international market has been under significant pressure from foreign tea, had to devise countermeasures to salvage the situation. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 3:00 PM, the bureau convened an important discussion meeting in its office with Shanghai Chinese tea exporters and tea houses. Those present included Ji Zexin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, Chen Jingsheng, and others. On the tea merchant side, there were representatives from Zhongxinchang, Chen Yitong, Chen Xiaocun, Shenyuan Cai Zhongxiang, Hongyuanyong Jin Jianxing, Yuanfengrun Zheng Jianyuan, Shengchang Sheng Wang Lizhai, and many others. Ji Zexin chaired the meeting, and Chen Jingsheng took the minutes. The central issue discussed at the meeting was a recent secret intelligence report received by the bureau and an order from the Ministry of Industry, stating that a certain country had secretly hired two tea masters from China to imitate Chinese tea and planned to sell it cheaply in the United States, the South Sea Islands, and Dong Province, etc., to destroy Chinese tea. The tea merchant representatives then discussed active countermeasures. As a result of the discussion, the first step was to investigate the truth of the case, and the second was to conduct extensive international publicity to prevent consumers from suffering losses from counterfeit Chinese tea. At the same time, it is hoped that national Chinese tea exporters and tea factories will pay close attention to this matter. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Municipal Security Department Actively Promotes the New Life Movement; Held Cleanliness and Epidemic Prevention Work Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Strike Committee of the British American Tobacco Factory Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that since the assault on striking workers occurred at the British American Tobacco Factory, the situation of the labor strike has become increasingly serious. The strike committee of the factory decided the night before last to request the authorities to make serious representations to the factory. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the strike committee elected six representatives, Lu Peide, Dong Aosheng, Wang Amao, Liu Dehua, Xiao Gengsheng, and others, and prepared a petition to the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Party Headquarters.

Conciliator Wang Gang of the Second Section received them and promised to submit the workers' opinions to the director for approval. The workers were satisfied and returned.</p>
<h3>The National Government's Shanghai Rehabilitation Commission Presents Plaques to Canal Dredging Commissioners</h3>
<p>The Puhuitang River in western Shanghai spans the three districts of Shang, Song, and Qing, extending east-west for dozens of miles. Together with the Wusong River, it serves as the two major trunk rivers north and south. Hundreds of thousands of residents along the river rely on it for farmland irrigation, commercial shipping, and daily drinking water, and its importance to people's livelihoods is not minor. However, due to years of neglect, it has become dirty and silted up, almost like a ditch. The "January 28th" incident caused particularly heavy damage. Mr. Song Ziwen, chairman of the National Government's Shanghai War Zone Rehabilitation Preparatory Committee, and standing committee members Zhang Shuyong, Hu Yunzhuang, and others, understanding the people's hardships, resolutely provided financial assistance and advocated for dredging. They also hired Zhang Weicheng, Yang Fuyuan, Shen Caigeng, and others as special commissioners to plan and carry out the project. Over a year has passed, and the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth sections have been completed one after another. The sixth section in Shanghai is expected to be completed this month, and the entire river will be unobstructed from then on. Farmers and merchants praised the project. The Shanghai Rehabilitation Commission believes that the canal dredging commissioners have worked hard from beginning to end and deserve commendation. Therefore, it has specially awarded them plaques with the words "Acts of Courage and Righteousness" to encourage them. The list of award recipients is recorded below, including Yang Fuyuan and Gu Rungui of Shanghai, Wang Jingzhi, Chen Ya-fu, Shen Caigeng and Gu Junjie of Songjiang, Li Qixian and Li Youxian, Zhang Weicheng and Wang Daohang of Zhoupu, and Jin Qiancheng, Yang Jiaoqiao and Xia Rusheng of Shanghai, thirteen in total.</p>
<h3>The Garrison Command Executes Three Pirates by Firing Squad: Shi Wenjin, Li Chenglai, Li Rongmao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Command issued a notice yesterday stating: "It has been investigated that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau previously presented twelve pirates, including Li Chenglai, and six suspects, including Lin Xingzhong, to the command. After interrogation, judgments were made according to law. Except for Li Laowu and eight others, who were sentenced to imprisonment and sent to prison, and Lin Xingzhong and six others, who were acquitted and released, Shi Wenjin, Li Chenglai, and Li Rongmao were sentenced to one year of imprisonment each for the crime of using violence and coercion against public officials performing their duties and sentenced to death each for the crime of jointly engaging in armed robbery at sea. They should be executed and deprived of their civil rights for life. The case has been reviewed and approved by the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. Therefore, the three persons, Shi Wenjin, Li Chenglai, and Li Rongmao, are to be taken from prison, identified, tied to the execution ground, and executed by firing squad as a warning. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge. The details are as follows: Shi Wenjin, 32 years old, from Huangyan; Li Chenglai, 37 years old, from Ninghai; Li Rongmao, 36 years old, from Haimen."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Pays Attention to Passenger Safety on Small Steamers</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications previously noted that small steamers in various regions do not pay attention to safety equipment, and passenger safety is often at risk in the event of accidents. Therefore, it formulated regulations for the implementation of safety equipment, instructing local shipping administrations to order various companies to comply. Now, the Shanghai Shipping Administration has received an order from the Ministry, stating that some companies have not yet complied and ordering them to strictly comply. After receiving the order, the administration has ordered various companies to comply. However, due to the small number of inspectors in the administration, the regular and temporary inspections of existing ships are already very busy, making it difficult to investigate each ship individually. Therefore, the administration plans to send investigators to conduct spot checks on various ships from time to time. If any companies still disregard the order and fail to comply, they will be punished to maintain passenger safety. In addition, the administration, in accordance with the Ministry's order, has organized a ship collision dispute resolution committee. Various companies are able to comply with its judgments. However, there are occasional cases where parties are dissatisfied with the judgment, and the appellate body has not been designated. Moreover, ordinary courts often do not respect the principles of the committee's judgments, such as the recent case of the Jing'an Wheel, which has triggered a major controversy. Therefore, the domestic shipping industry hopes that maritime courts can be established as soon as possible. The administration also believes that the committee's judgments do not have the power to be effectively enforced. Therefore, it has also formulated principles and submitted them to the Ministry, requesting that provisions be added to the regulations for the organization of collision committees, stipulating the above two opinions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Management Committee Plans New Vehicle Standards and Invites Rickshaw Merchants for Discussion</h3>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Market - Actively Promoting the Unified Management of Weaving Households - Low Education Level of Weaving Households Reduces the Efficiency of Unified Management - Actively Implementing Training to Avoid Collapse and Expansion</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Cotton Cloth Market in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, is dedicated to promoting the sale of domestic yarn and controlling the family cotton cloth industry. Since its opening, its business has developed rapidly. However, the implementation of unified management of weaving households is a pioneering undertaking, and success requires active effort. According to Mr. Zhang Rongfu, the general manager of the market, the Anhui weaving households in the suburbs of Shanghai produce a wide range of products, but their knowledge is shallow. They only seek immediate benefits and disregard the greater good. Many of them fail to understand the market's painstaking efforts to gradually bring them into the right track, which has hindered the smooth implementation of the market's planned projects. At a time when the social economy is gradually collapsing, this relief effort is hampered by the difficulty of managing weaving households, and the efficiency is inevitably reduced. Fortunately, the price of yarn has recently rebounded, and the entire cotton cloth industry is expected to improve. He (Mr. Zhang refers to himself) will follow the will of the company's directors, implement the original intention, actively promote the two unified management tasks, and implement long-term training that combines technology and ethics to gradually bring them into the right track, so as to fulfill the responsibility of safeguarding the weaving households and prevent the collapse of the cotton cloth industry from expanding.</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui Cables Du Yuesheng - Begging for Disaster Relief for the People of Ningxia - And Sends Personnel to Request an Audience</h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui, Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government, said that the province was unfortunately hit by war again, with the rural areas of the four war-torn counties bankrupt and the people displaced. Urgent relief is urgently needed. Although the central government has allocated 50,000 yuan for urgent relief, it is a drop in the bucket and insufficient for distribution. He specifically telegraphed Mr. Du Yuesheng, a prominent figure in Shanghai, to appeal for the victims, and sent representatives Director Wei Hongfa and Director Ren Zhongjie to Shanghai to request an audience. The original telegram from Chairman Ma to Mr. Du Yuesheng is recorded as follows: "Mr. Du Yuesheng, I have not seen you for a long time. Ningxia Province is unfortunately hit by war again. The rural areas of the four war-torn counties are bankrupt, and the people are displaced. Spring plowing is missed, and there are no cattle, tools, or seeds left. The disaster is serious and indescribable. Now that the war is over, post-war work is urgently needed. Urgent relief is the top priority. Although the central government has allocated 50,000 yuan for urgent relief, it is a drop in the bucket and insufficient for distribution. A few days ago, public representatives Director Wei Hongfa, Director Ren Zhongjie, etc. were sent to Shanghai and Beijing to appeal for huge sums of money to save the victims. They are planning to go to Shanghai to request an audience, please grant them an audience so that they can present the disaster situation in detail, and please give your strong support, without any doubt."</p>
<h3>Wen Hongen Writes to Renji Hall - Begging for Disaster Relief for the People of Qiongya - The Area Suffered a Terrible Hurricane and Drought - Widespread Suffering and Urgently Seeking Donations for Relief</h3>
<p>Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently wrote to Renji Charity Hall on behalf of the Qiongya disaster victims, requesting relief, saying, "To the esteemed executives of Renji Charity Hall, I have now received a letter from the Qiongya Disaster Relief Committee, stating that our committee is raising funds for the Qiongya famine relief. We have sent a letter to the Shanghai Renji Charity Hall, along with a donation list, requesting donations to help each other. We hope that you will be concerned about your hometown and contact us nearby to discuss the progress. We look forward to hearing from you. After the hurricane last year, Qiongya was followed by a drought, with widespread suffering and starvation everywhere. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. The Guangdong Provincial Government has allocated funds for relief, but the disaster area is too wide and there is much to be done. The government's finances are difficult and the subsidies are few. We hope that all philanthropists will help to raise funds to save the victims and show compassion. We are grateful for your support. Sincerely, Wen Hongen."</p>

<h3>Where Did the Stray Bullets Come From on the Shanghai-Taicang Road? - A Thick Glass Window is Pierced - A Passenger is Shot in the Neck</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, the No. 12 bus of the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, driven by driver Tang Qiusheng, was traveling from Liuhe to Shanghai. When the bus passed near Pengpu New Bridge, a bullet suddenly flew from the north, piercing a hole in the thick glass of the window, making a cracking sound. The passengers in the car looked at each other in surprise and saw that a passenger, about forty years old, was grazed by a bullet on the neck. After the bus arrived at the Shanghai station, the passenger went to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was minor and there was no danger to his life. After learning of the incident, ticket seller Yang Bowen reported to the second squad of the second team of the Pengpu Security Regiment, which is in charge of the area, and asked them to investigate and apprehend the person who fired the gun to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Assassination of Guo Fengzhi - The Murderer Xu Zilin is Arrested</h3>
<p>Guo Fengzhi, a resident of Wuxi who lived in Feihong Zi Road, Zhabei, was shot and killed while going out for water at 5:45 AM on the 3rd of this month because he was selling enemy goods. The murderer fled without a trace. At about 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Xia Liusheng, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, found that Xu Zilin, a Wuxi native who was 36 years old, was the murderer in the case. He was drinking tea at the teahouse at No. 221 Yuezhou Road. He then cooperated with Zhou Kaiwen, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Concession Police Station, and Chinese constable No. 207 to go to the teahouse and arrest Xu. He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the third criminal division of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the previous situation and said that the victim was selling enemy goods for profit. Vagrants nearby extorted money from him. Guo agreed to give each person three yuan per month. When he wanted to increase it to five yuan but failed, he was brutally killed. The defendant denied it at the police station. The case is serious. A formal public announcement from the local court is required for the transfer. According to the wife of the deceased, Ms. Lu, the defendant came twice before and took three yuan for the monthly fee. At that time, he came with Xiao Delin, who is on the run. Xiao had a pistol and threatened me first. A moment later, my husband was shot down outside the door. Afterwards, I filed a complaint with the local court with his name. According to Detective Xia's report, when questioned, the defendant said that he was a neighbor of the deceased and had never taken fees from him every month. He hesitated to provide further information. Judge Liu Yugui ordered Xia Liusheng and Guo Lu to send an official letter to the Procuratorate of the Local Court to transfer the defendant for custody.</p>

<h3>Man and Woman Committing Suicide by Taking Poison - Because They Could Not Bear Their Son's Threats for Money</h3>
<p>Wang Shifu, a native of Ningbo, who is 50 years old, used to be a peddler. He never married. More than 20 years ago, he became acquainted with Chen Wang, a woman from Dachang, who is now 51 years old. The two of them live in No. 37 and No. 38 Dongxin Lane near the Grand Bell in the French Concession. However, Chen Wang also has a son, who was born to her former husband. He does not work and specializes in wandering around. Because he learned of his mother's secret, he often went to Wang Shifu to threaten him for money. This happened repeatedly. Recently, he extorted money from Wang, but Wang could not respond, so he turned to his mother to force her to get it. He roared like thunder, causing the two of them to be uneasy all day long. They had a sudden feeling of resentment and went to the Central Hotel together the night before last, opening Room 420. They swallowed opium to commit suicide. Fortunately, the tea attendant noticed it and rushed them to Renji Hospital for treatment. After emergency treatment, they were saved and discharged from the hospital at about 12:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Death of Madam Zhao Wu</h3>
<p>Madam Wu Shuyin, the wife of Mr. Zhao Jinqing, the former chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, was the second daughter of the famous pastor Mr. Wu Caiqin. She was a devout Christian from an early age, kind, thrifty, and generous in giving alms and donating funds to establish schools and hospitals, and various other good deeds. Her name was well-known in the church. This spring, she suffered from heart, kidney, and waist diseases. Medical treatment was ineffective, and she passed away on May 25th. Madam Wu married Zhao at the age of 21. She was very filial to her father-in-law, managed the family with integrity, was frugal, and lived in poverty. When Zhao started his business and worked in politics, business, and academia, holding important positions, Madam Wu took charge of everything, so that he had no worries about the family. She was as hardworking as ever. She gave birth to seven sons and five daughters, all of whom she breastfed herself. The family education was good, and the children did not know what gambling was. However, she was kind to others, modest, and generous to the poor, which was not something that ordinary women could do. She taught her children to be moral, diligent, self-disciplined, and beneficial to others. Now her eldest son, Tie Zhang, has been the chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for many years. When Madam Wu died, she ordered her children to use her clothes and decorations to build a church, which was truly a model for Christians and a pioneer of new life. In accordance with Madam Wu's will, no obituary will be issued and no funeral will be held, in order to correct the customs of the time. The funeral will be held on the 8th of this month, and the coffin will be temporarily placed in the Zizhu Xuan in Fahua Town.</p>

<h3>Zhabei - Dispelling Rumors of Ghosts in New Houses in Hua'an Lane - It is Suspected That No One Has Actually Witnessed the Reported Events - Well-Wishers Spreading Rumors Without Factual Evidence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was suddenly rumored that ghosts had appeared in the new houses in Hua'an Lane, Zhabei, at around 8:00 PM the night before last. In the vacant house at No. 35 along the road in the lane, it was even said that many people were gambling, and there were radio sounds, laughter, and the sound of mahjong tiles mixed together, reaching outdoors. When the audience outside the door knocked and broke in, there was no one inside. Ordinary ignorant couples in the neighborhood all regarded it as a strange event, and those who went to watch it blocked the road. The reporter believed that in this era of scientific advancement, there could be no such thing as ghosts and monsters, so he went to investigate. He learned that no one had actually witnessed the reported events. When asked, nearby residents also said that they had only heard it from others, which was obviously not credible. Hua'an Lane is located at the corner of North Zhejiang Road and Huaxing Road. There are 60 to 70 buildings in the lane, which covers a large area. It is bordered by North Zhejiang Road to the east, Huaxing Road to the south, North Shuncheng Road to the west, and Xinmin Road to the north. Although the east side of the lane is on the concession road of North Zhejiang Road, the houses are still in the Chinese territory. The east and west sides have shops built along the street due to the lively location. The entrance of Huaxing Road is separated from the shops by the side, and the address is No. 35. The place where the ghosts were said to have been discovered was inside the house. Because the new houses in Hua'an Lane were completed on April 1st of this year, a certain grocery store moved into the house to do business. In order to make the arrangement more beautiful, they hired workers and masons to repair the house, and also replaced the solid floor. Therefore, the original floor was removed. The craftsmen dug the ground and saw a coffin. The coffin board was rotten, and only the skeleton remained. Well-wishers then fabricated stories that two masons suddenly died without any illness, and that three shop assistants of a certain grocery store contracted strange diseases and died. The store moved out. After a few days, a certain official sauce and wine shop rented it, and two shop assistants suddenly died violently within two days. Therefore, the shop did not dare to live there anymore and moved out after a few days. The reporter asked in detail how the masons died and how they were buried, but no one could answer. No one could name the grocery store or the official sauce shop, because the house had not been rented out. If a store had moved in, it would not have been so easy to move out as the rumors said. According to people in the lane, several local hooligans passed by the area the night before last and saw that the lights in the house were very bright and there was a lot of noise, as well as beautiful radio music and the sound of mahjong tiles. At more than 8:00 PM the night before last, there was suddenly a lot of noise in the vacant house at No. 35, and the electric lights were so bright that they shone like daylight, and the sound of mahjong tiles continued to crack. This attracted the attention of nearby people who came to watch. The house was still silent and dark. A person with some knowledge said that the radio waves were everywhere, and it was inevitable that there was a temporary mishearing of the sound in the vacant house. The electric light was reflected from nearby and entered the house, but in reality, the vacant house remained the same. How could there be ghosts in a vacant house? This statement is enough to break the fallacies of well-wishers. Another person said that during the construction of the new house, the area was the defense line of a one-two war, and many soldiers of the 19th Route Army who resisted the Japanese were killed there by Japanese bombs. The ghost event this time may be related to the souls of the soldiers who resisted the Japanese. Those who say this have a special resentment and cannot prove their claims. The Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District, which is in charge of the area, was afraid of accidents, so it sent police to suppress the situation and maintain order.</p>
<h3>Residents of Laoshusha Oppose - The Customs Builds a Powder Magazine - Four or Five Hundred Men, Women, and Children - Flock to the Municipal Government to Petition</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs plans to build a powder magazine in Laoshusha, which has been opposed by the people of the area. They organized a self-defense group and elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, and submitted a petition to the municipal government requesting the recall of the order to demarcate the oil pool area. The details have been published in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, while the people of the area were waiting for a solution, on the 24th and 25th of last month, officials from the Dredging Bureau and the Customs, led three to five armed customs police officers to investigate the population and residence years of each household in the area. They used a lot of intimidation and bullying, causing the people to be terrified, as if a major disaster was imminent. Therefore, the day before yesterday, four or five hundred men, women, and children from the entire area gathered and flocked to the municipal government to petition, demanding that illegal actions be stopped immediately to avoid disturbance. The mayor happened to be at the stadium giving a speech and had not yet arrived at the government. The chief guard of the municipal government inquired about their intentions and ordered four or five representatives to enter the government. The rest stood under the hot sun waiting. Later, representatives Chen Fengming, Ling Shangqing, Wang Zheng, Lu Wenbiao, etc. came out to persuade the people. They asked the mayor because there was something going on in Shanghai, a certain section chief had met with them on his behalf. It was said that the people were exposed to the sun, and there were many women and children, so they were afraid of heatstroke and other things. They could go home first. The official letter had been received. Once the mayor returned to the government, he would report to him, ask him to approve it, and make appropriate arrangements to comfort the people. The people thought that the answer was satisfactory, so they lined up to return to the boat to cross the river and return to their hometown.</p>
<h3>Fire in West Shanghai Yesterday Morning - Two Boys Buried in the Fire - Mother Witnesses the Tragic Death of Her Two Sons - Faints on the Spot in Grief</h3>
<p>At 9:15 yesterday morning, a fire broke out suddenly at No. 6 Xingguang Lane, west of the Xujiahui Catholic Church. It quickly spread. After the nearby police officer reported to the police station, the fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire was out of control and had spread to the neighboring houses at No. 4 and No. 5. After the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire, it was finally extinguished at about 10:00 AM. As a result, No. 5 and No. 6 were completely destroyed, and the floor of No. 4 was burned. When the fire was raging, a middle-aged woman rushed to the scene and wailed loudly. It was said that she was Xue Zhang, a resident of No. 6. Her husband's name was Xue Peide, a local, 30 years old, and worked in the lettering room of the Zhonghua Book Company. They had two sons, one six years old and the other four years old. In the morning, Xue had gone to the office to work, and Zhang went to the vegetable market alone to buy groceries. The two sons were left in the house and the door was locked. Now that the disaster has happened, it is assumed that both sons have been buried in the fire. After saying this, she cried loudly. The police officers of the second division of the sixth district and the firefighters searched the ashes. Before long, the bodies of the two children were found in the living room. Zhang fainted on the spot after seeing that her two sons were charred. The neighbors then tried to wake her up and notified Xue Peide of the Zhonghua Book Company to deal with the aftermath. The police station is now thoroughly investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3>Falling While Climbing a Power Pole to Watch the Fair</h3>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, Xu Youlong, a 38-year-old man from Anhui, was climbing a utility pole in front of the Li Da Flour Mill on Jessfield Road, west of Shanghai, to watch the fair passing by. Unexpectedly, he accidentally lost his footing and fell, injuring his vital parts. He immediately became unconscious and was dying. Police officers Cheng Long of the Sixth District ordered the police car to take him to the hospital for treatment. However, he died before reaching the hospital due to the severity of his injuries.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhuying sues Zhou Exuan case: Judge investigates seriously, inquires in detail about the situation of Dayuan, visits the silversmith who made the ring. |Yesterday's debate concluded, awaiting judgment|</h3>
<p>Zhou Exuan, the eldest son of Zhou Weisheng, the owner of Zhou Gengji Yarn Shop and former head of the Suzhou Sojourners Association in Shanghai, was sued in the First Special District Court by the mother of his son, Zhang Zhuying, for abandoning Dayuan. The initial trial concluded, and Zhou Exuan was found not guilty. Zhang Zhuying was very dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After an initial hearing, the court ordered an adjournment for further investigation, as previously reported. It is now learned that Yu Hua, the head of the Criminal Court handling the case, believes that since Dayuan's parentage (whether Zhou and Zhang are truly the parents) has already been determined by the Forensic Institute, the institute should be able to provide substantial proof. Therefore, he personally visited the institute in Zhenru a few days ago and inquired in detail of Director Lin Ji about the circumstances of the original assessment. According to Director Lin, after his examination, the blood types of Zhou Exuan, Zhang Zhuying, and Dayuan were completely identical, and Dayuan's appearance bore a striking resemblance to Zhou Exuan. Therefore, it could be determined that Dayuan was the child of Zhou and Zhang. Judge Yu also noted that Zhang Zhuying had presented a gold ring, claiming it was a gift from Zhou Exuan during their courtship, but Zhou flatly denied it. Fortunately, the ring was engraved with the name of the craftsman who made it. Therefore, he specifically inquired at Lao Feng Xiang Silver Shop, where the ring was sold, and learned that although the craftsman had left four years ago, the style of the ring confirmed that it was made seven or eight years ago. After confirming these two points, he summoned both parties and witnesses to a joint court session yesterday afternoon for further questioning. First, Zhang Zhuying detailed her acquaintance with Zhou Exuan at the age of nineteen, followed by cohabitation at No. 8 Xinglongfang, Danshui Road, and the subsequent birth of Dayuan. When she was twenty-one, Zhou's parents discovered their living arrangement, and she temporarily moved to the Huizhong Hotel. Later, she sought payment from Zhou's younger brother, Du Xuan, which led to discord, and Zhou decided to separate from her, forcing her to live in a brothel, while the son was raised in the countryside, with Zhou paying monthly living expenses. The Chen family was the meeting point for both parties and the location for payment. She stated that she last received seventy yuan on July 18th of last year and has not received any since then. She concluded by saying that the original judgment was unfair, and she was unwilling to accept it, which is why she appealed. The court immediately questioned Zhou Exuan, who still denied that Dayuan was his child. Judge Yu then ordered the court clerk to announce the recorded statements from Director Lin of the Forensic Institute in response to the judge's questions, as well as the findings from the investigation at Lao Feng Xiang regarding the origin of the ring. Subsequently, witnesses Fang Chen, Yuan Chong who cohabitated with Zhou Du Xuan when she was a prostitute, Xia Songlai, and Dayuan's wet nurse, A'erb bao, were questioned. They all testified that Dayuan was indeed Zhou Exuan's child. However, Zhou Exuan's witness, rickshaw driver Cai A, testified that Zhang had been a prostitute and Zhou had visited her, but they had not cohabited. After debate by the lawyers for both parties, the judge announced that judgment would be reserved until a later date.</p>
<h3>Strange things happen in the world: A giant green and yellow snake crawls into the bridal sedan, raises its head in a bow, shakes its head, and sighs sadly. The bridal sedan rushes a mile away, only for it to reappear twice.</h3>
<p>Cao Quanlin, the 20-year-old eldest son of Cao Yinshan, a performer of ritual music living at Cao Family Residence, Xinqiao area northeast of Yangjia Town in Pudong, is betrothed to the young Miss Huang, eldest daughter of Huang Quanlin, a farmer living at Huang Family Residence south of the Zhangjiangzha Gate.

<h3>Nineteen years old</h3>
<p>The two families are old friends, so last year, due to a family illness, the unmarried daughter-in-law followed the custom of bringing good fortune to dispel illness. The family greeted her as a daughter and allowed her to visit her future in-laws in the inner chambers. After her return, the unmarried groom returned the courtesy by visiting his future father-in-law, as custom dictates, thus also lodging as a nephew in the groom's house.</p>
<h3>Unmarried couple</h3>
<p>Already of age, their affections blossomed, and the understanding parents allowed them to enjoy the pleasures of the bridal chamber early. As a result, the crystallization of their love is already five months along. Therefore, the wedding, originally scheduled for November of this year, was brought forward, fearing that by then,</p>
<h3>A baby will be born</h3>
<p>Which would be embarrassing. Thus, the wedding was brought forward to the other day. The procession was magnificent, with a full complement of attendants, drums and music filling the air, and a hundred vehicles escorting the bride. But as the bride's sedan approached the Guanyin Temple west of Zhangjiangzha on the way, suddenly,</p>
<h3>A giant green and yellow snake</h3>
<p>Appeared, over ten feet long, and burrowed straight into the sedan. The bride shrieked in terror, and the wedding attendants were shocked. They frantically banged gongs to scare it away and poked it with bamboo poles. The giant snake raised half of its body, bowed its head, and</p>
<h3>Shook its head</h3>
<p>And sighed as if in sadness. The wedding party drove the snake away, and hurriedly carried the sedan a mile away. But the snake appeared again, so they drove it away in the same manner, and the bride arrived safely for the wedding. But she was greatly frightened, a truly extraordinary event.</p>
<h3>An old man from Jiancheng accuses his daughter and son-in-law of plotting for money and murder; he survived, but his son died. The boat and cash were all seized.</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, an elderly man named Gu Jin Yan from Yancheng, looking weak and ill, filed a complaint at the Caojiadu Police Station in the Sixth District of West Shanghai, accusing his son-in-law, his mother-in-law, and his daughter of conspiring to murder him for money. He stated that he was fifty years old, from Yancheng, and lived at No. 248 Qiangjiajiao, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai. He made a living as a boatman, with one son and one daughter. His son, Xin Da, sixteen years old, worked on the boat with his father. His daughter, A Da, now eighteen, was married last spring through a matchmaker to Xu Aju, from the same hometown living in Hongqiao. After the marriage, the couple was very affectionate and often came to visit. However, in the ninth month of the lunar calendar last year, when the father and son Xin Da were on the boat, the son-in-law suddenly came with the daughter. The son-in-law bought fish and meat, which the daughter cooked and served to her father. As they sat together to eat, the father suddenly felt dizzy and had severe stomach cramps. At the time, the father thought it was a sudden illness, and immediately went ashore, hired a vehicle, and went to the hospital for treatment. By the time he arrived, he had lost consciousness. After the doctor's best efforts, he was saved. After a long period of treatment, his mind cleared slightly, and the doctor informed him that he had been poisoned. The father realized that his son-in-law had tried to kill him. After more than half a year of treatment, he left the hospital last month, but his nerves were still disturbed and his body was weak. When he returned home, he learned that his young son, Xin Da, had also died from poisoning at the time. His boat, six hundred yuan in cash, and more than a dozen pieces of clothing had all been seized by his son-in-law. He therefore requested that they be arrested and prosecuted. After receiving the complaint, Director Tan immediately ordered Detective Team Leader Wu Kezhong, Deputy Team Leader Dong Wenrui, and detective Cao Chuqiao to secretly go to No. 24, South Henan, Hongqiao Town, and arrest the son-in-law Xu Aju, the daughter Xu Gu Shi, and the mother-in-law Xu Zhang Shi, and bring them back to the district. After separate interrogations by District Officer Xing, they all denied the accusations. The District Officer determined that the case involved accusations of plotting for money and murder, which was extremely serious, and immediately prepared a document and sent them to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Sixty-three tenants in Lianchengfang were sealed off yesterday and the day before. Tenants hold a meeting to discuss solutions.</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Lianchengfang on East Broadway Road and Ward Road in Hongkou, owned by Ni Tingzhi of Tongchang Hardware Store of Ningbo, is leased by Wuhe Foreign Firm. The Chen buyer of the firm is a relative of the owner. Currently, due to the tenants' request for rent reduction, Mr. Xu of the accounting department of Wuhe Foreign Firm, together with court judicial police and patrolmen, suddenly sealed off all sixty-three tenants in the alley yesterday and the day before, including the three tenants. The rent for tenants in this alley is more than half of that in the neighboring Baifuli. Monthly rent is deposited in the bank. The sealing off has angered the tenants of all the alleys leased by Wuhe Foreign Firm. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a joint meeting of tenants from Lianchengfang, Shunheli, Gengfang, Hepingfang, and Xihuali was held at Da Xian Public School in Lianchengfang.

<h3>A runner from a money exchange falsely reports a large sum of money being robbed, foolishly fooled by someone. The original stolen money is found, and he is detained pending further investigation.</h3>
<p>The Second Section, First Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, suddenly received a report from a young man at around 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, stating that his name was Qian Wenxing, 23 years old, from Zhenjiang. He worked as a runner for Yuan Heng Money Exchange at No. 119 Guizhou Road in the Public Concession. Today, because Shunyuzi, a shop in Furunli, Nine Acres, inside the city, needed money, he was ordered by the manager to carry two thousand dollars in cash to the shop. Unexpectedly, while passing through Liu Tomb Branch Alley, he was suddenly accosted by three robbers. One of the robbers pulled out a pistol, warning him not to make a sound, and robbed him of the two thousand dollars in cash he was carrying, before fleeing. He came to the police station to report and requested an investigation. At that time, the Director of the police station, Shen Zhenhua, was out on patrol with patrol officer Zhang Zezu and chief police officer Li Baoliang, and they had passed through Liu Tomb Branch Alley but had not encountered any robbery. After completing their patrol and returning to the station, they discovered Qian's report and, taking precaution, returned to the scene to question nearby residents in detail. They all stated that they had not heard or seen any robbery. They realized that Qian Wenxing was highly suspicious, and immediately detained him and interrogated him strictly. Qian then confessed that he had been dissolute and his monthly salary was insufficient for his expenses. He had accumulated a debt of more than one hundred yuan to the money exchange and could not repay it. He also heard that the manager was going to fire him. In desperation, he secretly consulted with Huang Wanhua, an accountant at the Yong'an Company Silk Department, who suggested that he falsely report being robbed while delivering the money, so that even if he was fired, he could use the money to start his own business. This was a foolproof plan and would achieve two goals at once. At the time, he was confused and influenced by Huang. He embezzled the two thousand dollars in cash that the money exchange had sent him to Shunyuzi today and deposited one thousand eight hundred yuan of it with Huang. He then rushed to the police station and falsely reported the robbery, but he was exposed. Director Shen, realizing the truth, immediately dispatched chief police officers and detectives to arrest Huang Wanhua at his address and recovered the original stolen money of one thousand eight hundred yuan. After notifying the money exchange to retrieve the money, the criminal Huang was taken to the police station and transferred to the First Special Court. After interrogation, he ordered a document to be prepared and sent the criminals Qian and Huang to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Qian Zhaofu and others kidnapping case sent back for retrial</h3>
<p>The case of local Qian Zhaofu, owner of the Yongfeng Timber Company in Nanshi, and Wu Xi native Pu Wenting, manager of the Fuxin Flour Mill, being kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded in the French Concession, was resolved in the autumn of the previous year. The French police, especially Inspector Jin Jiulin of the special division, captured the gang members Zheng Shifan, Zhang Afu (both locals), Zhang Jiancheng (Ningbo native, drove the car during the kidnapping), and Gao Ada (nicknamed "Cow Nose" Ada, Wuxi native). The Second Special Court sentenced Zheng and Zhang Jiancheng to life imprisonment, Zhang Afu to twenty years imprisonment, and Gao Ada to fifteen years imprisonment. Zhang Jiancheng was also involved in a kidnapping case in the Public Concession, and the First Special Court sentenced him to death, which was carried out. Zheng, Zhang, and Gao were dissatisfied with the verdict and hired lawyers to appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. After review, the court sentenced Zheng Shifan to twelve years imprisonment, Zhang Afu to life imprisonment, and Gao Ada was declared innocent. Zheng and Zhang were still dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and found that there were still doubts in the case that needed to be carefully examined. The original judgment was deemed inappropriate and was revoked. The case was sent back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. The Third Branch of the High Court received the case file and summoned the detectives who handled the case yesterday morning. Judge Sun Honglin opened the Third Criminal Court and ordered Zheng and Zhang to be brought to court. He questioned Zheng in detail about making a phone call to the victim at the Yarn Exchange. The court adjourned, stating that it would schedule another hearing after further investigation. The two criminals were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Copper teapots installed in fourth-class carriages, free for passengers to use</h3>
<p>To provide beverages for passengers in fourth-class carriages, it was originally planned to install automatic tea dispensers. However, each dispenser cost two hundred and twenty yuan, which was too expensive. The Carriage Department planned to install a large copper teapot with a tap at a suitable location at the end of the carriage, filled with clean, boiling water, and attach four porcelain teacups for passengers to use free of charge. A sample teapot was commissioned from a business, costing more than twenty yuan. With sixty-two fourth-class carriages on both lines, each equipped with one teapot, the total cost would be more than one thousand four hundred yuan. This has been approved.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Refutation of Foreigners' Distorted Interpretation of the Pilotage Treaty (5) - Declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the China Pilotage Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the interpretation and facts of the Sino-French Treaty, although the Sino-French Treaty contains the clause "Anyone holding three captain's certificates may be appointed by the French consul as a pilot," this clause is extremely ambiguous. If China had truly ceded the right of pilotage to France at that time, the treaty could have clearly stipulated that Chinese ships, upon arriving at Chinese ports, should be led by French pilots. Why is it necessary for the consul to appoint them, and why must they hold three captain's diplomas to be appointed? After our research, we have a firm and unshakeable explanation for this. That is, at that time, China was in a closed-door era. Although the government had understandings with foreign countries, allowing trade, the common people maintained their strong sense of self-respect. They naturally viewed the intrusion of foreign ships as shameful. Moreover, at that time, Chinese waterways had no markings and were far from comparable to today. Therefore, foreign ships could not enter or leave without relying on Chinese pilots. It can also be said that at that time, pilotage was entirely the domain of the Chinese. However, most of the Chinese people were driven by a sense of self-respect, so even though foreign ships offered generous profits to pilots, very few responded. Even if someone occasionally answered the call and guided foreign ships into the port, the authorities did not prevent it, but among the people, there were few who did not slander this respondent as a traitor. Therefore, foreign ships often did not feel any difficulty entering the port, but the relationship with pilots for exiting the port was often delayed. This is why the Sino-US, Sino-British, and other treaties all had provisions for the right to freely employ pilots. Only the Sino-French Treaty is unique among them. This is because France's treaty was earlier, and it felt more difficult to employ Chinese pilots. Therefore, at that time, France only needed to find a pilot to be sufficient, and it did not need to be limited to Chinese people. However, the territorial waters belonged to China, and naturally had its sovereignty. Therefore, three captain's diplomas were used as a restriction, to show that this move was a last resort, and to show respect for Chinese sovereignty in an inevitable situation. Otherwise, since China was in a closed-door era, of course, one less foreign ship was better than one more, so what did the three diplomas have to do with China? Even if the French consul at that time appointed someone who could not tell the bow from the stern as a pilot, or even broke the ship, what would it matter to China? Why must it be written into the treaty? Therefore, even the most flattering tongues cannot come up with a more reasonable explanation for the so-called three diplomas. Secondly, this can be proved by the facts. If China had truly ceded the right of pilotage to France at that time, and had a treaty to support it, then since the signing of the treaty, although Chinese ports would not necessarily be entirely occupied by French pilots, at least there should be traces of French people. Why is it that the formal statistics presented by Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, to the Prime Minister's Office in 1868 (24 years after the signing of the Sino-French Treaty) did not include a single French person as a pilot? This is a powerful counter-evidence that the Chinese government did not cede the right of pilotage to France at that time. It is also a positive proof that the provision of three captain's certificates to serve as a pilot was intended to respect Chinese sovereignty. In addition, after carefully consulting various treaties, we have discovered that there are many provisions for "the right to freely employ compradores." The wording and tone are exactly the same as the clause for the right to employ pilots. Now, the position of compradore has been filled by Chinese people for decades. Therefore, by extrapolating from the present, the pilot mentioned in the past was actually the same as the compradore, all of whom were Chinese. If the word pilot is misinterpreted, it would not only be inconsistent with the situation at that time, but also these treaty clauses could not have a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p>However, this treaty language is ultimately ambiguous. Perhaps the French at the time deliberately did this, so that they could allude to it or distort it in the future. Today, almost no one can prove it. However, judging from the treaties that China later signed with various countries, such as the Sino-US, Sino-British, Sino-Belgian, Sino-Norwegian, Sino-Swedish, Sino-Portuguese, Sino-Danish, Sino-Italian, Sino-Spanish, Sino-Japanese, etc., only gave each country the right to freely employ pilots, and did not mention anything else. This proves that the Sino-French Treaty did not cede this right, because the great powers have always shared China's interests equally (as the original text quoted by the newspaper said, everyone wants to grab the good anchorages, let alone anything else). Now, looking at the various treaties in the future, there is no right for foreigners to serve as pilots. This can also be a counter-evidence that when the Sino-French Treaty was signed, the right to serve as pilots was not given to France. The facts are very clear. As for the reporter's belief that the Sino-US, Sino-British, and other treaties have the right to freely employ pilots, that is, as each country having the freedom to serve as our country's pilots and seizing the right of our country's pilots, only that reporter has this kind of theory and this kind of logic. We can only see this as a joke and do not need to refute it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Italian Treaty also clearly stipulates the right to employ pilots. The so-called separate regulations and the need to negotiate with the consuls of various countries are only for the price of pilotage fees. Try reading Article 34 of the Sino-Italian Treaty, "Italian ships wishing to enter each port may seek pilots. After paying taxes, they may also seek pilots to take them out of the port. The pilotage fees paid and the pilots, etc., shall comply with the regulations, and the local officials shall discuss and establish them with the consular officials." With such a clause, even the average elementary school student can recognize that it is limited to pilotage fees. However, the reporter forcibly changed the pilotage fees to the right of pilotage in order to expand its scope. Isn't it hard work and getting worse every day? As for the tools used by the reporter to confuse people, that is, the Western mirrors that foreign gentlemen have always performed for us, have been completely exposed. Even if you perform it and talk about it in a fancy way, it is worth nothing and is just hypocrisy. After the treaty has lost its basis, the reporter's intelligence is to turn his eyes to personal writings. However, what we are discussing is the treaty issue. Even if Morse is a powerful writer of international law, his words can only be used as a discussion among scholars. What does it have to do with the treaty? Could it be that even if Morse says something a little more unbearable about China, China should be obligated to it? Moreover, the pilotage regulations established by the British consul when Morse mentioned the port of Niuzhuang were actually not recognized by the Chinese government. Therefore, it can be attributed to the frivolous actions of individuals, or it can be regarded as impolite to other countries.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the Hart Regulations, which we are most saddened by.</p>
<p>According to the statistics reported by Hart to the Prime Minister's Office in the seventh year of Tongzhi, from March of the sixth year of Tongzhi to March of the seventh year of Tongzhi, there were a total of 203 pilots in all ports in one year. 103 were Chinese, 40 were British, 35 were American, 10 were German, 6 were Danish, 6 were Swedish, 2 were Dutch, and 1 was Austrian. However, before Hart established the pilotage regulations, two things should be noted, namely (1) Although there were foreigners serving as pilots in our ports, the number of them combined was not as large as the number of Chinese. (2) Although the Chinese government did not crack down on the appointment of these foreign pilots as Chinese pilots, it was at least an action that had not obtained legal recognition. After the establishment of the Hart Regulations, there are also two things worth noting, namely (1) Since then, foreign nationals have served as pilots in China, although it cannot be said that they have a legal basis, at least it can be said that they have an official guarantee. (2) The right to select pilots is entirely controlled by foreigners, and all Chinese pilots are completely excluded throughout the year. Of course, these facts show Hart's loyalty to China, which is worthy of praise by reporters. However, in addition to these facts, we have also discovered the ambiguity between the Chinese and Western translations of the regulations. Who should be responsible for this moral accusation? But Mr. Hart is gone. We only want to blame our lack of self-competition and the lingering spirit of the former Qing Prime Minister's Office, and we don't want to make too many judgments. However, we are determined not to bury the facts. Therefore, we have to make some examples, so that our compatriots can have a certain understanding of our guests, or at least have a thorough understanding of Mr. Hart or quasi-Hart.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read an article in your newspaper on the 6th of this month about the dispute between the police at the North Station inspecting luggage and abusing passengers, which contained words such as "exceeding the norm in exercising their powers." After investigation, the passenger caused the dispute by refusing to be inspected and assaulting the police. The contents of your newspaper's report are inconsistent with the facts. Please correct them. Sincerely, Shanghai Public Security Bureau Fifth District Office. June 6th. To the Editor: Today's newspaper reported that Gu Zude, an employee of Shen Jincheng Bank, went from Shenyang to Ping, holding the first ticket of the Japan International Tourism Bureau. After investigation, there is no such person as Gu Zude among all the employees of our bank, nor has any other personnel traveled from Shenyang to Ping by car. Our bank has no branches in Shenyang. It must be a rumor. Please investigate and correct it. Sincerely, General Manager's Office of Jincheng Bank. June 6, 23rd year of the Republic.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news in your newspaper yesterday (the 5th) in the local section about "Ferry Overloading Causes Disaster", which is inconsistent with the facts. On the 30th of last month, when ferryman Zhang Rongsheng carried 22 passengers as usual from Pudong to Puxi, a passenger named Wei Jinsheng boarded the boat and appeared extremely exhausted. He leaned on the boat for a nap, and the boatmen repeatedly warned him, but he did not listen. When the boat shook to the middle of the river, it happened to meet a small wheel that passed by. The boat was hit by the waves and shook slightly. Wei Jinsheng fell into the water at this time. It was his own carelessness. When ferryman Zhang Rongsheng saw this, he immediately stopped the boat to rescue him. Other ferrymen Zhao Quanfa, Zhao Jintao, Zhu Guisheng, and Ji Guanrong also tried their best to help with the rescue at the same time. Unfortunately, the tide was high and the waves were big that day, and all rescues were ineffective. Your newspaper said that the empty boat shaken by Zhao Quanfa and Zhu Guisheng carried passengers and rushed straight like an arrow, so it was planned on a large ship, causing the person who fell into the water to be obviously inconsistent. As for the claim that "San Mao" did not save him, it is even more fictitious. Everyone has a compassionate heart. Is there any reason in the world not to save someone in death? After this case occurred, Ji Jieda and Zhang Rongsheng have been escorted to the Public Security Bureau by the water patrol team and transferred to the local court for handling. Whether this case is due to the boatman's negligence or Wei Jinsheng's own carelessness should be waited for the court to resolve according to law. However, the various sections reported in your newspaper are related to the reputation and future of the ferry. It is especially requested to be corrected in your newspaper to clarify right and wrong and block the truth. I pray that you will publish it in the "Local Letters" column of this newspaper. Sincerely, All the ferrymen of Dongjiadu. June 6 (Responsible Representatives) Zhao Shunxiang, Zhang Genliang, Zhao Fulin, Zhu Shisheng.</p>
<p>To the Editor: The news in your newspaper of June 6 regarding the strike of the Xiang Sheng drivers is indeed inconsistent with the facts. For example, the reason for the Xiang Sheng strike this time was actually caused by a small number of drivers being coerced by violence. On this point, our association's representatives of the Xiang Sheng workers have already published a statement in the newspaper on June 6. As for the strike of a small number of drivers in the company, of course, the company can continue to operate. How can the company stop operating from the day of the strike? It can be seen that the strike of the company's workers is by no means a small number of workers who can affect the company's operations. As for the company's treatment, the bedding is provided by the workers themselves, and the kitchen problem is that the workers pay for each meal. The so-called company kitchen is a business nature. The workers' wages are 24 yuan per month. I would like to ask which worker can receive 24 yuan per month. The tips given to the workers by the guests are the hard-earned price for the workers' 24 hours of service every day. The above is where the company's excellent treatment comes from. As for the strike period, thanks to Mr. Zhao Lian, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Mr. Dai Youheng, representative of the Municipal Party Department, summoning the capital representatives Zhou Xiqin, our association representatives Zhu Weichang and Zhao Pinzhen, and worker representatives Yang Jinsheng and Tan Along to discuss and resolve the following five methods: (1) Driver Zhu Xigen will resume work first. (2) The compensation for Yang Xue, who was injured, will be borne half and half. Considering Zhu Xigen's difficult livelihood, the staff will donate privately at their discretion. (3) All workers will resume work at the same time. (4) The wages that should be paid during the strike will be borne by the capital. (5) Other conditions will be handled after resumption of work. The above conditions are signed by both parties and decided, and the Party and government organs have records to check. Why is the section on the conditions published in your newspaper yesterday not true? After reading it, our association found that it was completely contrary to the facts, so we especially sent a letter to your newspaper, asking you to correct it. Sincerely, To the News Editorial Department of Shen Bao Newspaper, June 6, 23rd year of the Republic, Liu Zhigang, Zhu Weichang, Chen Qugeng.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers for Readers</p>
<h3>How Not to Become a "Bookworm" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— | Reply to Mr. Wu Shanbo |</p>
<p>What is meant by new avenues, and how does one read without turning into a "bookworm"? Undoubtedly, our answer addresses the three erroneous reading methods mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Firstly, our reading should not be rigid but dynamic; we do not read for the sake of reading but for our lives and the needs of the society in which we live. Theory is the guide of practice, and practical life is the content of theory. Even if we do not believe that practical life can encompass reading, we must never separate reading from practical life. In this society, we live like travelers. We already have various "guidebooks" for our travel references, but if we only hold onto those "guidebooks" without actual travel, then everything depicted in the "guidebooks" is merely a "castle in the air." Therefore, we "not only cannot" read with "ears that hear nothing outside the window"; instead, we should, absolutely should, carry our satchels, walk to the crossroads, enter the ranks of the masses, carefully observe society, understand society, and use what we read to mutually verify the current society. The knowledge we gain is not just knowledge from books but knowledge infused with practice. Our opinions are not just those of scholars but opinions rich in practical significance. As the saying goes, "Mastering human affairs is knowledge," which, in the sense of opposing "bookworm-ism," is worth pondering.</p>
<p>We are all people burdened by life. Separated from our lives, we do not have the leisure to confine ourselves in houses to read useless, dead books. When we pick up a book, we must first ask ourselves, what is the relationship between this type of book and life and society, and how should we imbue the book we read with new meaning? For example, consider the study of aviation. Is aviation an urgent necessity at present? This is one question, but the most important question is not this, but rather, when we learn aviation, is it to fight for whom? Or for the transportation of the masses in the sky? Once this question is answered, we can connect what we learn with the practice of overthrowing imperialism or shipping, and our aviation knowledge becomes knowledge with practical significance. Otherwise, saving the nation through aviation is just a "scholar's view." For example, we are shop assistants or apprentices. We must learn some commercial knowledge, but we must ask: with some commercial knowledge, can we avoid the danger of unemployment? To answer this question, it is clear that this is not enough. Therefore, we must delve into the society surrounding us to find its root causes.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we read any book or study a certain subject, the standard we decide on should be the needs of society, and we should use reality as a measure of criticism. We must integrate reading with our practice. Only this kind of reading will not produce "bookworms."</p>
<p>The above is only a explanation in principle. Later, we can talk about concrete methods. As mentioned earlier, we must not read randomly, but systematically. What is systematic reading? First, it is called gradual progress. A child who is only a few months old will naturally not be able to digest bread. The teachers of the past often made this mistake, even though they kept chanting the teachings of Master Kong, "Haste makes waste." They started by teaching children the Four Books and Five Classics. Is it possible for beginners to understand the Four Books and Five Classics? We see that people who have read old books for more than ten years often cannot write as fluently as an elementary school student, which is entirely due to this reason. Therefore, we must not skip levels when reading, we must not aim too high. We should start with the explanation of words, then the acquisition of general knowledge, and then the study of specialized sciences. When we enter the specialized study of a certain discipline, we should pay attention to determining our standpoint. We first stand on a specific theoretical foundation to choose the books we want to read. We first read the part of the books that is theoretically unified. Only after we have a foundation can we expand the scope and study the works of famous schools, because at this time, we already have the ability to criticize, and we will no longer be deceived by books.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is assimilation. How can we assimilate what we read? This is not a very difficult question. When we read any book, we should not memorize its sentences or formulas. We should understand each formula and repeatedly give our own examples. If you study social sciences, you can use all the social phenomena you have seen and heard as examples from the book. In this way, the content of the book will inevitably become the content of your own theory.</p>
<p>Due to the limited space of this article, what has been said may be incomplete, but if readers can read in this way, we believe that the matter of becoming a "bookworm" like Mr. Wu will not occur.</p>
<h3>Princess Der Ling's Original Work, The Fragrant Records of the Imperial Scent</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>He hung this foreign drum on his assistant's back, and he himself stood behind and beat it with two not very thick drumsticks, one strike at a time. The sound produced by this foreign drum was even more monotonous than a gong. If we were to tap on a table with a bamboo chopstick, it would make the same sound. Also, woodpeckers make a similar sound when they work in the forest. Although the sound of the foreign drum is so monotonous and unpleasant, it occupies a very important position in the entire orchestra; it is used to adjust the rhythm like a chime or gong.</p>
<p>I think the "Nine-Tone Gong" is the most interesting of these instruments. The sounds it makes are all the scales actually used in Chinese sheet music. Its structure is not complicated either; it is just a wooden frame. The style of this wooden frame is roughly the same as the large frame I mentioned earlier that is used to place various instruments. The large frame is about five feet high and eight feet wide, and the two wooden feet at the bottom are very heavy and spread out very wide, so no matter how many instruments are hung on it, it will not be top-heavy, and it will not be blown down even in the wind. However, the frame of this Nine-Tone Gong is only eighteen inches high and one inch wide. It has a total of three horizontal bars, nailed in sequence, with equal distances. On each horizontal bar, there are three small gongs hanging; and on the back of the top horizontal bar, there is another hook, which is used to hang it on the large frame. (51)</p>
<h3>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander, Episode 30: Seeing Off the Mourning Geese, Burying His Head to Defend the Territory, Bullets Pierce Strong Enemies, Shedding Blood to Dye the Lonely City</h3>
<p>Because Zhao Ziqiang had doubts about his attitude towards the common people, he did not return to the company headquarters but temporarily stood in the open space to see what was going on. At first, the common people came in an endless stream and still went to the battalion headquarters. After about half an hour, they came out of the battalion headquarters. The color on their faces was pale. Some of them were trembling and simply crying with tears in their eyes. Zhao Ziqiang thought to himself, how strange, what's wrong with them, did they receive a reprimand from the battalion commander? So he grabbed a commoner and asked: What's going on with you? The man said: Your battalion commander told me that the Japanese devils are about to attack here. Their planes are fierce and will randomly drop bombs in the sky. We common people don't fight wars, what are we doing living here? He advised us to move out completely within one day tomorrow. How can we bear to abandon our good home? Even if we don't care, may I ask, where can we go if we suddenly run away? Zhao Ziqiang said: So, you don't plan to leave. The commoner frowned and said: The battalion commander is telling us to leave, which is always a good intention, what can we say? Let's talk about it in a day. Zhao Ziqiang understood their intentions after hearing the commoner's words and was still watching there, so he said: You plan to see how the wind blows before leaving, right? But when that time comes, whether they let you see how the wind blows, that's not certain. Although the commoners felt that what he said was right, they were not willing to follow Ziqiang's words. They sighed a few silent breaths and walked back. Ziqiang put his hands in his trouser pockets, pointed his toes on the ground, raised his heels, and shrugged his body repeatedly. (402)</p>
<h3>Spring Water Shield is Better Than Autumn Water Shield</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>When going to West Lake, one must eat Water Shield Soup, so West Lake's Water Shield and Sweet and Sour Fish become the only two side dishes for wine. The Hangzhou people who know how to do business pack them in bottles and sell them elsewhere, and they become the only two specialties along with lotus root flour. But the renown of Water Shield still has to give way to our Wujiang as the earliest. During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Mr. Zhang Jiying |Han| was in the mansion of Qi Wang Jiong. Suddenly, because of the autumn wind, he thought of the water shield soup and seabass sashimi of Wuzhong, and he returned to his hometown with great enthusiasm. To this day, Wujiang Middle School still has the ruins of the Three High Temple, and he is respected as the leader of the Three Highs, so it goes without saying that water shield is valued because of the person. However, water shield is the most tender in spring, and in autumn, it is far inferior. Mr. Zhang only used this to write his resignation and return home, and he did not say that autumn water shield must be flavorful.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Han Yi had a poem praising water shield: "Picking water shield in the spring bank and making soup to taste, jade is smooth and silk is soft and fragrant with dew. But laughing at Zhang Han for not knowing the taste, he thinks of his hometown after the autumn wind rises." He also appreciates spring water shield and also ridicules Mr. Zhang for not knowing the taste. Mr. Han is indeed a connoisseur, and the seven words "jade is smooth and silk is soft and fragrant with dew" truly depict it perfectly. I often hear people who have eaten water shield say that the taste is not good at all because they cannot get its mystery like Mr. Han. And it is generally cooked very heavily with chicken soup and lard, as if forcibly pulling a villager into the city, how can one get its innocent taste?</p>
<p>Master Jin Hewang does not write poems to praise things, nor does he rhyme, but he wrote a long ancient poem praising Pangshan Lake (the most famous for producing water shield in eastern Wujiang), saying: "The soul is gentle and the water and milk intertwine, the texture is smooth and the ice saliva sticks." He can describe its beauty well. He also said: "Zhang Han thinks of the autumn wind, autumn water shield is old and gray, picking should be timely, the spring waves add peach blossoms." He also said that spring water shield is better than autumn water shield.</p>
<p>Those who come to Suzhou these days generally want to try this spring water shield. It is best to tell the kitchen in advance not to cook it too greasy, and it is enough to add some mushrooms inside at most; and the sticky liquid must be kept as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Plucking Roses</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chuo</p>
<p>In this early summer with green plantain lilies and red cherries, roses have already emitted a intoxicatingly sweet fragrance in red splendor. At the moment when a good dream is first awakened, the cries of selling "roses" waves are sent to the pillow, crisp and melodious, with a piece of the market sound.</p>
<p>Roses are indeed lovely flowers; the color is so gorgeous, the fragrance is so sweet and pure, and their taste, whether for brewing wine, tasting tea, making sauce, or making sugar, is so fragrant and lingering in the teeth. Roses are truly outstanding exotic products among all flowers, with color, fragrance, and taste all being top-notch, roses are truly worthy!</p>
<p>But although roses are gorgeous in color and fragrant in taste! However, they have their own stubborn nature, and those sharp thorns make the frivolous people who break flowers at every turn dare not easily trample them. "Roses have thorns, and silver waterfalls contain mud," which is their unique personality, and those prickly thorns are definitely not something that frivolous drifting Yang flowers can hope to reach!</p>
<p>The way to eat roses; brewing tea is the easiest, you only need to dry the flowers and brew them with tea leaves. The procedure for making wine is slightly more complicated. Pick the petals, soak them in sorghum, and then add rock sugar. After about a month or so, it will be fragrant, sweet, and edible. The method of making sugar is also a spectacle in Geneva! Shi Ying</p>
<p>First pick the petals, soak them slightly in frost plum (available in southern goods stores) water, then press the water off in a dry towel, then put them into a basin and mash them, then add white sugar and mash and shake evenly, make various patterns, first spread oil paper on the ash to absorb the moisture, and then bake them on the left stone ash to dry them. The method of making sauce is similar to making sugar, but after the white sugar is mashed evenly, it is put into a porcelain jar, and after half a month, the roses and sugar in the jar will be cooked and rotten like sauce.</p>
<h3>A Record of Viewing the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xia Ming</p>
<p>There are not a few Chinese painting associations, but this is the first time that women have held an exhibition. I made a special effort to go and see it. The venue was on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. The four walls were full of beautiful works. Yang Xuejiu's landscapes are full of vigor and majestic in power. Gu Fei's landscapes are pure and free of dust, and are by no means ordinary. Chen Xiaocui's figure paintings are delicate and beautiful, with a special charm, and are naturally the work of a poet. Among them, there are four screens with inscriptions by Tian Xu Wosheng and Xiaodie, depicting figure paintings that are elegant and ethereal to the extreme, truly resembling those who do not eat the food of the human world. Ding Yunbi's flower and bird paintings, one of which depicts a kingfisher holding a fish about to fly, are full of natural interest. Feng Wenfeng's calligraphy is powerful and unparalleled, and there are many of her works on display in the venue. Wu Qingxia's landscapes and figure paintings are both meticulous and well-organized, and the Rural Life is especially good. Yu Jingzhi's figure paintings are elaborate and delicate. Tang Guanyu, Xie Yuemei, and Pang Zuoyu's flower paintings are all dignified, serene, and beautiful, continuing the legacy of Nantian. Xie Yingxin's Dawn Wind and Residual Moon, Li Qiujun's Lady Guan, and Gu Qingyao's large-scale landscapes are all appreciated by me. It is a pity that I did not have time to view them all, and I think there are still many pearls that have been missed. This article is just a record of the general outline.</p>
<p>Random Talk</p>
<h3>Yan Ling's Fishing Platform Should Be in Mount Fuchun and Others (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>As for the area where Yan Ziling farmed and fished, Mr. Chen stubbornly said that he "perhaps thought the bass in Qililu was too good, so he didn't mind the hundred-mile journey from Fuchang to Qililu," which is all a biased view and willing to guess and fabricate in order to embellish his own clumsy reasoning. In the previous article, I have proved that Qililu is right under Mount Fuchun, so why should Ziling bother to walk a hundred miles? Now I will further explain that Yan Ling's farming and fishing were definitely in one place, and not as Mr. Chen said, one in Fuyang County and one in Yan Ling's Seto. In addition, Mr. Chen also said that the Shibao in Yan Ling's Seto may be Ziling's villa, which is even more ridiculous!</p>
<p>Indeed, the biography in the Book of Later Han and Huangfu Mi's Biography of High Scholars both write the same sentence: "He was appointed as a remonstrance official, but he refused, so he farmed on Mount Fuchun, and later generations named his fishing place Yan Ling's Seto." Mr. Chen then cited this ancient text to explain that Mount Fuchun is Mount Fuchun, and Yan Ling's Seto is Yan Ling's Seto, saying that there is a hundred miles between them. Little does he know how to write articles! According to Mr. Chen's intention, this paragraph should be derived in the following formula to be clearly understood? "······He refused, so he farmed on Mount Fuchun and fished in the Fuchun River, and later generations named his farming place Fuchun Field (or Yan Ling Field), and named his fishing place Yan Ling's Seto," what would that look like? (Using the ancient text saving word method to make similar counter-evidence is not worried about the lack of data)</p>
<p>Lu Fangweng's Record of Buying Fields at Yan Prefecture Fishing Platform: "······I only thought that when I first went to the prefecture, I passed by the Qililu under the fishing platform of Mr. Yan of the Han Dynasty. ······Reading Cui Ru's Record of the Fishing Platform in the Tang Dynasty Xingyuan, I thought that there were a hundred acres of flat land on it, enough for farming; below was a clear stream, enough for fishing; now the place for casting the hook is there, but the field is gone,……There was a confiscated field, and then he bought a hundred acres of folk field from the side, except for the floating levies, to give to those who serve the Buddha. And next to the shrine, he created a Buddhist temple, housed bells and drums in the building, and stored scriptures in the room, and the monks' huts and guesthouses were all available.······Then the shrine of the gentleman can be permanently maintained.······"</p>
<p>Xie Ao's Record of Crying Bitterly on the West Platform: "······And now I cry at Ziling's platform,······Ascending the shore to visit Ziling Shrine, resting in the monks' house by the pool, destroying walls and blocking walls, as if entering a tomb······Ascending the West Platform, setting up a master in the corner of the desolate pavilion, bowing twice and kneeling down······So we sighed with emotion, and then ascended the East Platform, stroked the gray stone, and returned to rest in the list.······"</p>
<p>According to the above two articles, the former proves that farming and fishing are in one place; the latter shows that the fishing platform is on Mount Fuchun, which is generally recognized as the location of Mr. Yan's shrine. We have really never heard of a shrine or fishing platform of Mr. Yan in Fuyang County, which is a hundred miles away from Yan Ling's Seto; nor have we ever heard of the shocking question of "whether the fishing platform is on Mount Fuchun"!</p>
<p>In short, the question raised by Mr. Chen that "the fishing platform is not on Mount Fuchun" is a diversion. However, at the same time, I also searched for two doubtful fragments about the place where Yan Ziling fished, both from Yao Peiqian's Lei Ye, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Under the Chishong Mountain in the Hangzhou River category in Lei Ye Volume 4, there is a note: "East of Fuyang, named Chiting Mountain, Tongzhi: Chishongzi stopped at this mountain when he drove the crane, and Yan Ling fished at this platform, and the base still exists." Under the Tongzhou category in the same book and volume, there is a note: "Southwest of Fuyang, there is a Stone Seto, which is said to be the place where Ziling fished." The former dares not say it is true, because Chiting Mountain should be in Gansu, and Chishong Mountain should also be in the place where Huang Chuping turned stones into sheep north of Jinhua County; whether the fishing base exists or not is even more unknown. The latter, in my opinion, should be the original site of the current Yan Ling Seto fishing reef, because there are also sandy beaches such as Liu Jia Zhou and Da Xiao Kong Zhou there, so it is naturally impossible to determine that there is no Tongzhou. Perhaps Mr. Chen has other textual research findings on these two articles, so he confirmed that Yan Ling's fishing platform is not on Mount Fuchun, then we may as well explore its source in detail?</p>
<p>Finally, I have to declare that although this is a very ordinary academic study, I do not have the Yan Prefecture Gazetteer to examine, so if there are any errors, I hope readers will correct me, but all those who visit Yan Ling Fishing Platform regard the place where the fishing platform is located as Yan Ling Mountain (i.e. Mount Fuchun), which is an ironclad fact! Which place in Fuyang County does Mr. Chen refer to as Yan Mountain, or is it Yan Ling Mountain in Tonglu County, which I confirmed to be in Tonglu County, and I also hope that someone can point it out! Furthermore, in Mr. Chen's writing, there are phrases such as "even if there was no name of Tonglu at that time," "maybe it was called Yan Mountain," "or because of the flavor of bass······" "or it was his villa," etc. I think that a textual research scholar should not have such vague assumptions and ambiguous attitudes!</p>

<h3>Second General Meeting</h3>
<p>The second general meeting was held at 2 p.m., chaired by Wu Bangwei. After the formal opening, they immediately began discussing specific plans for implementing the physical education curriculum standards for senior and junior high schools promulgated by the Ministry. The items were discussed and amended and passed one by one. An abstract of the plan is recorded below: (1) Use gymnastics and games as tools to develop muscles, strengthen internal organs, promote blood circulation, and achieve the goal of physical health and sensitive senses. (2) Use organized competitions as a method to cultivate public and private virtues such as unity and cooperation, law-abidingness, loyalty, courage, and striving for progress, and achieve the goal of noble personality and abundant spirit. (3) Train application skills to prepare for self-defense and national defense, cultivate good customs, and build the foundation of national spirit. (Implementation methods) Divided into seven types: morning exercises, regular classes, extracurricular activities, intra-school competitions, inter-school competitions, physical fitness tests, and physical education grades. (1) Morning exercises: The time should be revised at any time depending on the season. Regardless of cold or heat, they must not be stopped for any reason. The teaching materials for boarding students and day students are distributed separately and compiled by physical education teachers. They are changed once a week and focus on natural movements. Boys and girls are held separately. The method of roll call is determined by each school. (2) Regular classes: twice a week for senior high schools and three times a week for junior high schools, one hour each time. It is absolutely not suitable to schedule physical education classes within one hour before or after meals. Students with physical defects should be given a special class during extracurricular time. Outline of teaching materials and schedule for regular classes for senior and junior high school boys and girls (omitted). (3) Extracurricular activities: Each student should have at least 30 minutes of extracurricular activities every day. The items and time distribution are as follows: A. Apparatus gymnastics group (all year), B. National defense group (all year), C. Track and field team (all year), D. Football and basketball (November to March of the following year), E. Tennis, volleyball, and softball (April to June, September to October). (4) Intra-school competitions: 1. All items with competitiveness in regular classes and extracurricular activities may hold intra-school competitions, once each academic year. (2) The intra-school competition items and periods that secondary schools must hold are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Track and field sports meet, late April to mid-May. B. Basketball game, within March. C. Football game (boys), within October. D. Stacking and relay game, within October. E. Tennis game, within September. F. Volleyball game, within May. G. Group competitions, that is, based on the results of skill crossing and experience. H. Performances (apparatus, dance, gymnastics, mechanical movement, etc.) are held during opportunities such as amusement fairs, parent-teacher conferences, and celebrations. (5) (Inter-school competitions) (1) In addition to participating in the secondary school joint sports meet, each school should, depending on the economic ability of the benefiting school, try its best to unite with other schools to hold confrontation or joint competitions, so as to stimulate students' love for the school and receive the benefits of technical observation. (2) Each school should try its best to participate in the local sports competitions to promote social sports. (3) Representatives of excellent athletes from each school who attend inter-school competitions shall not enjoy other treatments except for the prizes they deserve. (6) (Physical fitness test) (1) Regarding the physical fitness test, three types are tentatively set: physical examination, skill test, and common sense test. (2) The physical examination shall be held once within the shortest period after the start of each academic year, as a guideline for setting up special classes. (3) Skill tests shall be held separately at the end of each semester or at the end of the teaching period of the sport. (4) The common sense test shall be held once at the end of each semester. (7) (Physical education grades) (1) The method of giving grades for physical education and the passing standard shall be determined by the Education Department after statistical research based on the test results of each school.</p>
<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
<p>Today (7th), from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., the deliberation plan and proposal review meeting will be held. The third general meeting will be held from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. After the proposal discussion is completed, the closing ceremony will be held, it is said.</p>
<h3>Details of the First Meeting: More Than 30 School Representatives and Director Zhou Reported at the Chairman's Office; Divided into Four Groups to Elect Representatives to Take Charge of the Review</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) In order to improve physical education in secondary schools, the Jiangsu Education Department specially convened physical education teachers from secondary schools throughout the province at 3 p.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the Education Department to hold a physical education conference. Those present included Xiang Shaoxuan, a representative of the Education Department, Wu Bangwei, director of the Zhenjiang Provincial Sports Ground, and Zhou Mingzhang of Zhenjiang Normal School, and more than 30 other people. After the meeting, Chairman Zhou Fohai reported on the purpose of the meeting. At 3:30, the discussion of the proposal began, and Chairman Xiang Shaoxuan took over. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhou's report briefly stated that physical education is generally neglected by people and is considered unimportant, which is actually a mistake. Physical education, on a small scale, is related to personal health, and on a large scale, it can also be said to be an essential element for the survival of the country and the nation. Since the "September 18th" Incident occurred, the voice of saving the country has been loud. Some advocate saving the country through aviation. The positions are different, and the propositions are naturally different. It cannot be said that they are wrong, but saving the country through aviation is inevitably partial, not concrete. We advocate saving the country through physical education, then we dare to say that this includes saving the country through physical education as a whole. Although it cannot be regarded as the only strategy, it is at least a basic condition. For example, foreigners can fly airplanes for more than ten hours, which is very common, while Chinese people can only support it for five or six hours. This is a clear proof that the physical fitness of Chinese people is not as good as that of foreigners. At present, generally speaking, the average people are still on the horizontal line, while the physical fitness of students at school is weakening day by day. I heard in Nanjing that the result of a physical examination for recruiting military police showed that only 20% of students above middle and high school were qualified. This situation is really alarming. Jiangnan has always been known as being weak in literature, and special attention must be paid to the physical fitness of young people. The most important points of this conference are: (1) Regarding the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry; (2) Regarding the minimum equipment standards. In addition, I have several personal opinions that should be paid attention to not only during the meeting, but also usually. 1. It must be "universal" and "constant." "Universal" means the universality of people and the development of types. "Constant" means that we must pay attention to regular training, not only in the sports field, but also at any time and anywhere, not only during sports meets, but also after the meeting. The sports meet is only a means, not an end. Our purpose is universal and constant training. We must not reverse the cause and effect. 2. Every action must be real, otherwise there will be the following two drawbacks: A. No effect; B. Unable to coordinate. I hope everyone will be responsible for doing it. In class, we should pay attention to the eyes, mouth, and hands so that we can achieve our goals. 3. Be strict, especially pay attention.

<h3>Actively Building Great Shanghai: The Municipal Sports Ground Officially Starts Construction; Chengtai Factory Wins the Bid with More Than 870,000 Yuan; The Construction Preparation Foundation Laying Ceremony Will Be Completed in Mid-July Next Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Great Sports Ground, which has been in preparation for years and is a great project, has officially started construction and is scheduled to be completed in July next year. The Municipal Authority will hold a grand groundbreaking ceremony. The National Games in October next year will be held at the stadium. Special exploration records the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Construction Begins and Will Be Completed in One Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Great Sports Ground was initiated and built by Mayor Wu Tiecheng. The total cost is one million yuan, and domestic sports experts Shen Siliang, Ma Yuehan, Dong Shouyi, Wang Zhengting, and Chu Minyi participated in the design and review of the drawings, which were designed by architect Dong Dayou. After several reviews and revisions, it was approved, and a tender was held in May for the construction project. It was opened at 2 p.m. on the 4th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Engineering Bureau. More than ten well-known construction factories submitted bids. Chengtai Factory won the bid with the lowest amount of 878,203 yuan. After review by the Municipal Authority, both parties signed a contract and construction has begun. The Municipal Authority commissioned Dong Dayou, a well-known architect and member of the Municipal Central District Design Committee, as the supervisor, and stipulated that the project be completed before July next year, so that the next National Games will be held at the stadium.</p>
<h3>The Mayor Will Personally Lay the Foundation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Authority's construction of a magnificent sports ground is of great significance. Therefore, after the foundation of the stadium is built, a grand groundbreaking ceremony will be held, and Mayor Wu will personally lay the foundation. The location of the stadium is in the Central Park of the city, so after construction, most of the park will be leveled and transformed. The first part of the stadium to be built is (1) the track and field, (2) the gymnasium, and (3) the swimming pool. The subsequent parts to be built are the tennis court and the baseball field. After it is officially completed next year, it will be able to look down on the Far East.</p>
<h3>Willing to Cooperate with the Sports Association</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Authority, the significance of the Municipal Government raising funds to build a sports ground this time is very significant. On the one hand, it is the purpose of promoting sports and strengthening the physical fitness of citizens. At the same time, it is also to assist in the prosperity of Great Shanghai's construction. Therefore, after the completion of the sports ground, it is hoped that the sports community will cooperate to achieve the practical effect of promoting sports. Because the equipment of the stadium is not only the best in the country, but also the location of the central district is wide, and the air is clean, which is very suitable for sports. The Municipal Government is actively developing transportation so that the municipality can be effectively used. Recently, the sports ground of the National Sports Association has been greatly affected because the landlord has taken back the land. The Municipal Authority hopes that the Sports Association can cooperate in the future to enable the city's sports to obtain more full development in a new environment, and the prosperity of the central district will also get great help. Also, regarding the cooperation between the Sports Promotion Association and the Municipal Sports Ground in the future, according to reporters, the Association also has this intention. The complete equipment of the Great Sports Ground is very convenient for the Association. However, it still needs to be considered because the location is a bit far away. But in the near future, the two parties will officially cooperate and jointly assume the responsibility of developing sports, so that the sports community in the city will shine, or it is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Japan and the Philippines Illegally Dissolved the Far Eastern Games; Our Country Will Issue a Statement to Member States; The Declaration to the World Committee Will Be Started; Funds Are Still Being Raised to Make Up for the Shortfall in the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Japan and the Philippines used illegal means to dissolve the long-standing Far Eastern Games. Their absurd behavior not only aroused deep indignation among our compatriots, but also caused dissatisfaction in international public opinion. Regarding the future policy of our country, the sports authorities have repeatedly clarified it. The reporter yesterday also asked Shen Siliang of the Sports Promotion Association about the content of the statement to the World Sports Committee. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Reissue a Statement to Vigorously Explain Illegality</h3>
<p>According to Shen, the illegal means of collusion between Japan and the Philippines are of no value, and the signing of the Philippine Sports Committee reveals the sweet words of temptation of the Japanese and the international interests. The statement submitted by our authorities to the World Sports Committee is now being planned and started. This issue is by no means an easy matter. Before the statement, it is planned to first draft a declaration denying the illegal dissolution and send it to all member states to solemnly declare that the membership is protected and that no petty people are allowed to manipulate and obscure, etc.</p>
<h3>Raise Funds to Make Up for the Shortfall</h3>
<p>The reporter also learned that the funds for our country to attend this Far Eastern Games totaled more than 70,000 yuan. Although efforts were made to economize on expenses, there was still a shortage of funds. The summary of this trip cost more than 80,000 yuan. The shortfall was paid by the athletes and must be compensated. Therefore, it is still planned to solicit some donations from all walks of life. In addition, the relocation and deployment of the Promotion Association requires expenses everywhere, so fundraising is particularly urgent.</p>
<h3>Open Singles Final of Handball: Zhu Kuan vs. Chakaleng; At 5 p.m. Today in Xiqing</h3>
<p>The first Shanghai Open Handball Doubles Championship has been won by Zhu Kuanhong Yu Kui, a young athlete from China. The singles championship will be held at 5:30 p.m. today at the Xiqing Stadium. The qualifiers are Zhu Kuan and Westerner Chakaleng. The meeting of the two heroes will definitely be a great battle. In this competition, Zhu has been winning repeatedly from beginning to end, and once defeated Mr. Cha. Therefore, the championship of this year is in Zhu's hands. As for the previously mistakenly arranged order of Zhu and Bo Aiseili, it has been canceled by Xiqing, because Bo has never obtained the qualification to compete with Zhu. If Zhu still wins in today's battle, the championship will be his. If he is unfortunately defeated, there will be a final match to resolve the championship of this year.</p>
<h3>The International Games Will Be Held in Mid-October</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Track and Field Games organized by the National Sports Promotion Association was originally scheduled to be held in the spring, but it could not be realized due to the conflict with the Far Eastern Games. Now it is mid-summer, and the weather is too hot, which is not suitable for this sport. The Promotion Association has decided not to hold it in the first half of the year and plans to hold it in mid-October as in the previous year.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Japanese Puppets in the Northeast Are Preparing to Establish the Highest Educational Institution for Enslavement; The Higher Normal School Will Open in the Spring of Next Year; The School Site Is in Shenyang, Formerly Northeast University</h3>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Shenyang) In order to actively enslave the youth of the Northeast, the Japanese invaders, although the educational institutions in various provinces are all managed by them, the Japanese still fear that their enslavement education cannot be popularized throughout "Manchukuo." Recently, the Japanese puppet education authorities have been preparing to establish a higher normal school at the site of Northeast University in Shenyang. It is reported that the preparations for the establishment of the school have been largely completed. The school opening is scheduled for the spring of next year. Students entering the school will be selected by puppet organizations from various places. The internal facilities of the school are completely modeled after the Japanese higher normal schools. The purpose of education is to promote friendship between Japan and the puppets and to study the kingly way. If this school is established, it will be the general group for enslaving the youth of the Northeast, and our compatriots will be forever under the control of the Japanese slaves.</p>
<h3>The Zhejiang Education Department Orders and Issues the Outline of the Measures for Scholarship Assistance Funds to Each County and City; It Will Be Implemented from the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>The names and methods of student subsidies and allowances in each county and city in Zhejiang Province are extremely diverse. The Education Department, in accordance with the names set by the Ministry, uniformly changed them to scholarship amounts. If funds are sufficient, scholarship assistance funds may also be set up. The Education Department specially ordered and issued the Outline of the Measures for Scholarship Assistance Funds to each county and city, and ordered each county and city to follow the actual needs and financial situation to formulate detailed measures and submit them for approval to be implemented from the 23rd year. The original measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Outline of the Measures for Scholarship Assistance Funds to Each County and City</p>
<p>1. Each county and city should set up scholarship amounts in order to reward students of this county or city who are currently studying at public secondary schools or above in this province, in terms of their academic performance and conduct. If funds are sufficient, scholarship assistance funds may also be set up in order to support the above-mentioned students from poor families. (If more funds can be raised, it is not limited to students from public secondary schools or above in this province.) In accordance with the provisions of this outline, the scholarship assistance funds measures of a certain county or city should be formulated separately and submitted to the Education Department for approval and implementation. 2. The existing student subsidy fees, allowance fees, and student visit allowance fees in each county and city, except for the subsidy fees for publicly funded students of the Provincial Public Education Experimental School, should be abolished from the 23rd year and changed to scholarships. Funds should also be raised or a portion of the funds should be changed to scholarship assistance funds. 3. The number and amount of scholarship assistance funds in each county and city should be determined by each county and city itself, and the number of places may be specified for students of a certain type of school depending on local needs, but students of normal and vocational schools should be given priority over others. 4. If the amount of scholarship assistance funds per person in each county and city is relatively large, students of schools with free half-board or free full-board may be given a reduced amount. Students who receive scholarships must have an average academic score of 80 or above, and their conduct and physical education scores must be 75 or above. Students who receive scholarship assistance funds must have a poor family background and their academic, conduct, and physical education scores must be 70 or above. 5. Students who meet the qualifications stipulated in the preceding article and voluntarily want to receive scholarships or scholarship assistance funds must determine and apply for one type when applying each term and cannot apply for both. After the end of each semester, within the prescribed time limit in this county or city, parents or guardians must prepare a letter of application for scholarship or scholarship assistance funds, together with the student's academic report card issued by the school for this semester, and send it to the Education Bureau (experimental county directly to the county government) or the city government of this county or city. If the deadline is exceeded, it will not be processed. The application form should specify the student's name, gender, age, current school, department, grade, date of entry, whether they have received other allowances, subsidies, scholarships, or scholarship assistance funds, or are free of charge, the name, occupation, and address of the parent or guardian, and a two-inch photo of the student should be attached. Those who receive scholarship assistance funds must also provide detailed information on the family's economic situation and the number of people, and the amount of school fees paid by the student each semester. 6. The Education Bureau or the Experimental County Government or the City Government should first conduct a detailed investigation after receiving the application form and transcript (the transcript must be sent to the original school for verification and stamping), and then submit the investigation results to the Education Committee for review within the time limit. For students applying for scholarships, those with better academic scores; for those applying for scholarship assistance funds, those with a better family poverty situation and academic scores should be used as the standard for granting. After the review and decision, the county should report to the bureau and ask the county government to experiment, and the county should report to the county government, and the city should report to the city government for approval. Regarding the review of the poverty situation, priority should be given to orphans without permanent property or children of hired farmers, tenant farmers, servants, shopkeepers, primary school teachers, and those with an annual income of less than 300 yuan. The number of family members is also an important reference. 7. After the scholarship or scholarship assistance fund for each semester is approved by the county or city government, the names of the qualified students will be announced, and the parents or guardians of each student who applied for this semester will be notified in writing by the Education Bureau or the Experimental County Government or the City Government, and the qualified students will be ordered to go to collect the funds within a limited time. 8. When qualified students receive scholarships or scholarship assistance funds, they should issue a receipt, and a guarantor who is a resident of this county or city must issue a guarantee letter and submit it to the Education Bureau or the Experimental County Government or the City Government, guaranteeing that they can bear the responsibilities stipulated in Articles 10 and 11. If the Education Bureau or the Experimental County Government or the City Government deems it necessary, the guarantor in the preceding paragraph may inquire before issuing scholarships or scholarship assistance funds. The Education Bureau or the Experimental County Government or the City Government should visit each guarantor once each semester until the responsibilities stipulated in Articles 10 and 11 are exempted. If the guarantor is unable to guarantee for any reason during the guarantee period (such as leaving the county or death), the student should be ordered to find another guarantor. 9. The granting of scholarships or scholarship assistance funds is based on one semester. If there is no change in the student's application qualifications, they may continue to apply each semester, but they must still prepare the documents stipulated in Article 5. 10. Within two years after graduating from scholarship assistance funds students, if they are assigned by the county or city government to serve in the county or city (the job served is limited to the subject they studied), if the job compensation is appropriate, they must not refuse or shirk, regardless of the distance of the place of service. The service period should be one year for those who receive scholarship assistance funds for one semester, and so on. If they avoid it for any reason, the guarantor should be ordered to recover or compensate for the scholarship assistance funds received by the student within a limited time. Each county and city may stipulate in the regulations for students who receive scholarships, ordering them to serve, depending on the circumstances. (7) (1) If a student who receives a scholarship or scholarship assistance fund drops out of school midway without being approved by the Education Bureau or the Experimental County Government or the City Government, after verification, the guarantor should be ordered to recover or compensate for the scholarship assistance fund received by the student within a limited time, and the student's qualification to request scholarships or scholarship assistance funds in the future will be revoked. (10) (2) Scholarships and scholarship assistance funds should be included in the county or city education budget each year. (10) (3) Each county and city should expand the amount of scholarships and scholarship assistance funds each year to create more talent. (10) (4) Each county and city should submit a special report to the Education Department on the details of the scholarship and scholarship assistance fund handling process each semester for verification.</p>

<h3>Education Circles in This City Warmly Celebrate Teachers' Day Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Private Schools in the City Held Gatherings at Wuben and Shangwen Schools, Unanimously Requesting the Ministry of Education to Officially Designate June 6th as Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Teachers' Day. The city-wide Teachers' Day celebration, prepared by four groups including the Municipal Secondary Education Association, was held at Wuben Girls' High School at 2 PM. At 6 PM, a dinner was held at Yuebinlou Restaurant. Separately, the celebration prepared by the faculty and staff of the municipal universities in the Shanghai South and Zhabei districts was held at Shangwen Primary School at 2 PM. In the morning, they also visited the China Educational Equipment Manufacturing Factory and held basketball and volleyball matches. At 6 PM, a dinner was held at Zhimeilou Restaurant. Details of each event are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>丨Wuben Girls' School丨 Enthusiastic Participation</h3>
<p>Participants yesterday included the Municipal Education Association, the University Education Association, the Secondary Education Association, the Primary School Principals' Association, and secondary schools such as Guanghua, Chizhi, Wuben, Aiguo, Binhai, Fushi, Huiling, Chuangzhi, Wusong, Jingye, Shanghai Girls' High School, Nanyang Commercial School, Xinlu, Minli, Xiejin, Lida, Private Shanghai High School, and Cihang. Primary schools included Qiuzhi, Yangjing, Maicun, Songxue, Shezhuang, Juequn, Xinmin, Sisheng, Donggou, Jianqiao, Yizhao, Jingnan, Weida, Caotang, Bide, Longde, and Shanghai Primary School, totaling over 150 schools and over 500 teachers. The Korean Overseas Rencheng School in Shanghai also sent representatives to participate in the celebration.</p>
<h3>Warm Celebrations</h3>
<p>The celebration was held at 2 PM. Slogans were posted throughout the venue. Xu Zexiang, Xu Zeyi, Chen Gaoyong, and others served as receptionists. The presidium consisted of Huang Zao Xiong, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Jicheng, Wu Zhiqian, and Yan Zhenyu, with Xu Zexiang and Tang Zenghang as recorders. After performing the ritual, Chairman Chen Jicheng first reported on the preparations and the significance of the celebration. Then, Drs. Liu Zhanen and Tai Shuangqiu gave speeches, and Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau delivered a speech. Proposals were then discussed, and photos were taken before the event concluded. Chenbao, Datong Bookstore, Zhonghua Bookstore, Commercial Press, and others distributed books, newspapers, and folding fans at the venue. At 6 PM, a dinner was held at Yuebinlou Restaurant, and the celebration was quite lively.</p>
<h3>Passionate Speeches</h3>
<p>Liu Zhanen's speech briefly stated: "Today we are holding Teachers' Day, we dare not celebrate, nor do we need to petition, only review mistakes, in order to repent, and hope that teachers have three points: (1) have professional spirit; (2) seize opportunities to work hard; (3) pay attention to the spirit of experimentation." Next, Tai Shuangqiu's speech briefly stated that June 6th is the Double Sixth Festival, designated as China's Teachers' Day, and in the future, it can be expanded into an International Teachers' Day. According to a survey, the living expenses of Shanghai primary school teachers show that two-thirds of the teachers' salaries are below sixty yuan, which is very different from the treatment standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education, and the teaching time is too long, which affects work efficiency. On today's Teachers' Day, we should ask the Ministry of Education to stipulate June 6th as Teachers' Day, and propose to the whole country to build a memorial tower for unnamed teachers in the capital, and suggest to the world to set June 6th as International Teachers' Day, hoping to be able to convene the first International Teachers' Conference in China in the future."</p>
<h3>Director's Address</h3>
<p>Director Pan's inquiry stated: "Today is Teachers' Day, I have already mentioned some hopes regarding the primary school part in the gathering at Shangwen Primary School. Now I would like to offer some opinions regarding the contributions of teachers in middle schools and above. Currently, some people say that primary school students are better than middle school students, and middle school students are better than university students, as if university teachers are not as dutiful as middle school teachers, and middle school teachers are not as dutiful as primary school teachers. In fact, this is not entirely true. We believe that teaching primary school students is easier than teaching middle school students, not in terms of the level of the curriculum, but in terms of the different ages of the students and the relationship to the social environment. Primary school students are under thirteen or fourteen years old, and are easily guided by teachers in a fully exposed environment. Middle school students are at a stage of drastic physiological and psychological changes, and their external contacts and activities are relatively extensive, making them easily susceptible to bad influences. Teachers in universities, middle schools, and primary schools alike bear the responsibility of training citizens and restoring the nation. However, middle school teachers are more difficult than primary school teachers, so expectations for middle school teachers are even more urgent. Middle school teachers must broaden their horizons and bring middle school students completely under the leadership of teachers in order to obtain proper education. The meaning of education is not only teaching books, but teaching people, teaching students how to be people. Teaching students to read books is only a part of teaching people to work. Teachers in middle schools, regardless of their subject, have this responsibility of teaching people. In the past, many teachers only managed their own courses, which is a mistake. I hope everyone will correct this trend. Secondly, teachers</p>
<p>Should enlighten students to awaken a spirit of service to society. Recently, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the education authorities of various provinces and cities to use students' vacations to actually serve society. This is the meaning. I hope everyone will lead students to do so with a spirit of not being afraid of difficulties, such as reducing illiteracy, which must be done through the cooperation of the government and the people, and the mobilization of all teachers and students."</p>
<h3>Proposals Passed</h3>
<p>(1) Submit a proposal to the Education Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Education to officially designate June 6th as Teachers' Day. (2) Submit a proposal to the Education Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Education to improve teachers' treatment and guarantee teachers' status. (3) Submit a proposal to the Municipal Education Bureau to dispatch teachers in batches to conduct educational inspections at home and abroad. All of the above proposals were passed.</p>

<h3>The China Children's Education Society's Japanese Study Notes (5)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>In the social education of Kobe City, what is worth mentioning is the adult education lecture. This lecture started in Showa 7. At the beginning, men and women were mixed, and in February of the following year, men and women were separated. There were one male and four female. The male lecture was set up in Kobe Elementary School. The quota was originally 150 people, but unexpectedly, the audience was enthusiastic, more than doubling the quota. The lecture topics were mostly financial and literary, such as Japan's finances in times of emergency and Kobe Central Wholesale Market, etc. The lecturers were all university professors who had gained people's faith through research. The women's lectures were held in four elementary schools in Kobe, Kitano, Yamate, and Shimosano. The content of the lectures focused on blind children, hygiene, home education, entertainment, and self-cultivation. In addition to the lectures, practical guidance was also provided. The lecturers and instructors were all principals, school doctors, nurses, and officials in charge of the Ministry of Education. The utilization of school building space and the school as the center of society are starting to take shape here. The supplementary classes for workers are for the education of working-class people. Classes are usually held at night. The city currently has two departments, male and female, with a quota of 50 students per class. The course is set for 54 hours, 18 times of attendance. The qualifications for participants are based on the recommendations of various factories and shops in the city, and then selected before being placed in the class. The guidance items are: (1) self-cultivation, (2) thought, (3) economy, (4) industry, (5) entertainment. The women's department has a family chemistry item and reduces the industry course. The instructors are also professors from nearby universities and specialized schools. In addition, lectures and seminars are held. The relationship between Navy Memorial Day, the talk on the Nan Gong Memorial Day, the Manchurian and Mongolian immigration problem, the future battle in the air over Shanghai, the pilgrimage to the Manchurian and Mongolian battlefield, national regeneration, the 60th anniversary of the promulgation of the military system, and the significance of Army Memorial Day are all topics for its lectures. The lecturers are all military figures. The goal of this lecture is nothing more than to aim at me. The reporter notes this, and the reporter's feelings are constantly in his heart.</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese film education has flourished for a while. Whenever there is an opportunity to use it, they all rush to film and screen it. The city provided film education for the general public 59 times last year, including (1) 16 times for group life, (2) 23 times for air defense propaganda, (4) 5 times for the Manchurian and Mongolian Incident (according to the Japanese, Manchuria and Mongolia are always referred to as "Manchuria and Mongolia", whether in slogans, letters, or oral discussions. Is this how the Chinese feel? The Japanese are still not willing to call Manchuria a country), (4) 15 times for film borrowing and screening. Our country currently has an organization for film education, and it is hoped that it will focus on the big picture and start from the small picture. Don't play Rola and Hata again and again to win the applause of the audience for a while.</p>
<p>The Kobe education community also intends to report one or two things in this article for research. The most important education organization is the Education Association. Each district in the city has a district education association, and the city education association is the overall organization. Its undertakings can be heard as follows: (1) social education lecture, (2) encouragement of teachers' and children's sports, (3) investigation of local education materials, (4) geographical investigation, (5) opening of swimming and forest schools, (6) Shangchi Association, (7) teacher inspection and travel, (8) student comfort association, (9) faculty and staff travel, (10) off-campus guidance for children, (11) condolence to deceased members and families, (12) commendation of teachers' diligence, (13) opening of youth training centers, (14) opening of Linyi Seaside School, etc. The Education Association, the Education Association, and the Education Association have many undertakings.</p>
<p>There are also conservation societies, which study parenting, school medical associations, which handle the commendation of good children in the city, and study the care of mentally and physically weak children. The United Youth League is for the development of youth groups in the city, the Virgin Association, which studies the healthy life of women, and the Mother's Association, which studies the improvement of family life. It also has an early morning exercise group, etc. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>Only Hard Work is a Path to Survival</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>Recently, China's foreign trade deficit has been increasing year after year, greatly affecting national wealth, social economy, and the people's livelihood. The unanimous solution is to promote the use of domestic goods as a fundamental issue. Therefore, last year was officially designated as the "National Products Year," and this year is officially designated as the "Women's National Products Year," hoping to arouse the consistent attention of both men and women. The intention of those who named it is profound, and their efforts are painstaking. We cannot but express our utmost admiration for the gentlemen and ladies who wholeheartedly devote themselves to the national products movement. But after this, will domestic goods thrive from now on? Will the trade deficit change to a trade surplus from now on? It's definitely not that easy. Let us not hold any extravagant hopes, nor harbor any pessimism. We do what we can. Doing something is always better than doing nothing. It must be known that there are many reasons for the underdevelopment of domestic goods. If many of these reasons are not resolved, promoting domestic goods, although not impossible to be effective, will always feel like a case of getting half the result with twice the effort. The Ta Kung Pao recently made some insightful remarks on the issue of domestic goods:</p>
<p>For China today, advocating domestic production and domestic goods is a matter of life and death. It is very different from the situation in the past twenty years. If the customs trade deficit is more than sixty to seventy million yuan each year, how much wealth is left for the people? What is holding off bankruptcy? In three to five years, at most ten years, the national economy will be completely beyond repair.</p>
<p>The way to remedy this is to encourage exports, which is difficult, and to facilitate domestic circulation, which is easy, because the latter seeks self-reliance, while the former seeks others. In today's world of economic depression and high tariffs, how easy is it to increase exports? The only way is to first smooth domestic trade and make domestic goods popular. Only this is China's path to survival, and it can be achieved through political power. Failure to do so is tantamount to waiting for national demise, and there is no excuse for it.</p>
<p>China has been advocating domestic goods for no less than twenty years, but in practice, it is promoting the name but undermining the reality. The tens of thousands of domestic products today have survived through struggles under various forms of suppression. To be able to be displayed in conferences and enter the eyes of compatriots, it is unknown how much blood and tears have been spent.</p>
<p>I was greatly moved after reading this article, and I believe that in this situation, our blood is not cold, and our hearts are not dead. Only with a sincere and practical approach to the national products to save the nation movement is there a path to survival. But we must know that those who engage in the national products movement, whether they are fools or enthusiasts, regardless of the future results, we can only work hard, and only then will there be a glimmer of hope. Taking this year's Women's National Products Year movement as an example, what are the enthusiastic ladies working so hard for? Why don't they sit at home playing cards and going to the movies, but instead do this thankless job? It's simply because their conscience has not been extinguished and their passion still exists. In this era when the Chinese people are still like drunkards in a dream, without widespread awareness, their meetings and speeches are much better than no meetings and no speeches. Their promotion and advocacy are much better than no promotion and no advocacy. They say what they can do and do what they say. It is because they believe in domestic goods and love to use domestic goods that they come out to persuade people to use domestic goods and promote domestic goods. In my opinion, I only feel grateful, only feel admiration, only feel that there are not many people who sincerely and practically engage in domestic goods. I only feel that there are too few fools and too few enthusiasts in the women's world. Mr. Li Haoran said: "If there were no efforts in the past few years, the trade deficit would be even greater today. Proponents do not need to be discouraged, but only need to seek further development to achieve the final victory." These words can represent the public opinion of the general public. Therefore, even if this year's Women's National Products Year does not achieve great results, it sows seeds here. The temporary effects may be hidden, but after a long time, brilliant flowers and beautiful fruits can certainly be expected.</p>
<p>Talking about National Products</p>
<h3>Two Things Worth Noting!</h3>
<p>— Dao Cou</p>
<p>"Dumping of foreign goods" and "proliferation of enemy goods" have almost become universal facts in recent times and are not surprising. However, in this year of promoting domestic goods, there are two things that are particularly worthy of attention, which are often overlooked by people. Although the matters are small, the relationship is significant. It must be understood that promoting domestic goods and using domestic goods must be considered from small matters and started from small places. Only then can we achieve twice the result with half the effort. Now, we may as well describe the two things worthy of attention as follows: (1) Wireless radio: This item is not a necessary form of entertainment in life. At present, in major cities, it has almost become a phenomenon that everyone has. Shops use it to attract customers, and households use it to entertain families. The source of these are all imported. European and American products are more expensive and cannot be purchased without hundreds of dollars. Recently, there has been more dumping and cheap sales of enemy goods. The selling price is only worth twenty to thirty dollars per item. Purchasers almost flock to them, making them popularized. As a result, sales increase day by day, and the outflow of rights and interests also travels east with the ship. This amount is certainly not small! I sincerely hope that those who love and promote domestic goods will quickly abandon the idea of purchasing them, because this item is not very necessary. If you can save, then save. If you can avoid, then avoid. This will create a path for domestic goods and protect the vitality of the country!</p>
<p>(2) Children's toys: In the past, children's toys all relied on imports. Fortunately, in recent years, domestic manufacturers have been established, such as toy factories and celluloid factories. The products are becoming increasingly refined, and sales are still passable. However, in this era of proliferation of enemy goods, there are still many enemy goods that are squeezing out domestic goods, such as rubber goods and celluloid toys sold at retail on the roadside. Statistics on this loss, calculated nationwide throughout the year, is also alarming, more than the sands of the Ganges? However, children's minds are easily changed, and their curiosity is very strong. They want what they want, and they buy what they buy, using all means to be spoiled. At this time, it is necessary for good mothers to take the "no use" and "no buy" approach, and guide them to distinguish between domestic and enemy goods, and inform them of the pros and cons of buying enemy goods. This will cultivate the basic concepts and habits of loving and using domestic goods in young boys and girls. Loving the country and loving children, is it not a win-win situation?</p>
<h3>National Products and Prostitutes</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Everyone thinks of "prostitutes" as base and lowly people, and everyone knows that "national products" is a noble and glorious name. However, now I am linking "national products and prostitutes" together to make the title of this article. Isn't this raising the value of prostitutes and sullying the dignity of national products? Readers, please listen to me, and you will understand:</p>
<p>I believe that wearing domestic goods is the noblest and most glorious thing. In other words, being covered in foreign goods, especially inferior foreign goods, is the most shameful thing. A decent and upright person would never wear foreign goods and abandon domestic goods. At the same time, a person with a low status and not engaged in honest work would never wear genuine and authentic domestic goods. We see on the streets that prostitutes soliciting customers and others engaged in the flesh trade are all covered in foreign goods. We can tell at a glance that these people are not decent or upright. This is a very simple principle that everyone can understand.</p>
<p>Therefore, during this Women's National Products Year, I have a suggestion, which is to change the public's mentality so that everyone has the idea that "a woman who wears foreign goods is a prostitute," which is the most base and shameful thing. In this way, I think there will definitely be many women who abandon foreign goods and use domestic goods. At the same time, we can also use honorary awards to reward women who use domestic goods, considering it to be a "woman of the times," the most glorious thing. However, this work is best done through education, starting from schools and then gradually expanding. This is also one of the tasks that schools should do during the Women's National Products Year. If schools across the country can do this, the achievements of the Women's National Products Year may not immediately show great results, but at least it will plant a good seed for the future promotion of domestic goods. Regarding the former, the psychological reform of "a woman who wears foreign goods is a prostitute" can not only make women who are not prostitutes refrain from wearing foreign goods in order to maintain their status, but also make prostitutes who are truly engaged in the flesh trade raise their status and switch to domestic goods. Seen in this way, isn't there also a related relationship between "national products and prostitutes"?</p>
<p>National Products Snapshot</p>
<h3>National Products in Kaifeng 丨 The First Sound of the Northwest Mobile Exhibition 丨</h3>
<p>— Zhao Bingren</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the National Products Northwest Mobile Exhibition Group, after two months of preparation, gathered 21 of the most famous domestic goods factories in Shanghai. On May 20th, led by the reporter and more than 80 representatives from each factory, we began our journey to our first exhibition site 丨 Kaifeng. Because this trip is of great significance to the development of the Northwest and the promotion of domestic goods, it is even more profound than ordinary exhibitions. The participating factories unanimously possess a broad vision and a spirit of sacrifice, and the representatives are also determined to endure hardships. This is indeed a pioneering initiative in the domestic goods industry and a symbol of the progress of the domestic goods industry. The entire group arrived in Bian on the 21st. With the assistance of the Construction Department of the Henan Provincial Government and the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce, the grand Kaifeng Exhibition was announced to open on the 27th.</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition is an exciting event in Kaifeng, perhaps because it has not been held for many years since the 17th year of the Republic. Before the opening, after a little publicity, people everywhere could be heard telling each other about "the exhibition is coming." The exhibition hall is located in the National Products Market on Republic Street. The building is an octagonal style with original partitioned decoration, which is very suitable. This time, each factory arranged the exhibits mostly according to local conditions, making full use of all the original facilities in the market. The gate of the venue was decorated with a tall and magnificent archway. Smaller archways were built at the entrances and exits of the venue, which were beautiful and exquisite. The venue allocation for each factory was arranged so that the China Enamel Factory and the Home Industry Cooperative were located on both sides of the entrance, followed by Wuhe, Huacheng, Dachina, Zhengtai, Sanyou, Huachang, China Chemical, China National Goods, China Knitting, West Lake, Mei Ya, Hongxin, Xin Ya, Guanghua, Huafu, Taikang, Dalong, and other companies, with Tianchu MSG Factory and Tiger Balm Yong An Tang at the back. Each factory had its unique arrangement and display, especially the three companies of Mei Ya, Family, and China Enamel. On the eve of the opening, each factory had completed its arrangement, and all the staff were waiting for the arrival of the opening day in a high-spirited mood.</p>
<p>As usual, the opening day of the exhibition began with a grand opening ceremony. The guests filled a theater where the ceremony was held. The chairman of the provincial government, the heads of various departments, the special commissioners of the party affairs, and the leaders of the gentry and scholars all attended, and all gave detailed and thorough speeches. For a time, the atmosphere of promoting domestic goods was particularly intense, making people excited and joyful. After the ceremony was completed, the exhibition hall was immediately opened. The people, men, women, old and young, poured into the venue like a tide. The counters of each factory were crowded with people looking at the goods and asking prices. Because there was a slight language barrier, the staff of each factory were extra careful to deal with it. From morning to night, the venue was always crowded. Quite a few of various domestic goods were purchased by visitors for trial use, especially the products of the China Enamel Factory, which were the most popular. On that day, almost everyone among the thousands of visitors to the exhibition went away with a China enamelware in hand. The Mei Ya silk and satin and Wuhe undershirts were also very popular among visitors, because affordable and high-quality domestic goods are exactly what the people of Kaifeng need!</p>
<p>National products in Kaifeng will inevitably have a great development, because the government of Kaifeng promotes domestic goods, and at the same time, the people of Kaifeng love to use domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Notice on Publishing a Special Issue on Summer National Products</h3>
<p>This publication plans to publish a special issue on summer national products on June 21st. We hope that each factory will separately inform us of the special features of summer products. If readers have criticisms, improvement suggestions, or special contributions regarding the products of domestic goods factories, so that both purchasers and manufacturers can benefit, they are also very welcome. However, each article should be concise and practical in two to three hundred words. Those that are close to propaganda or overly broad will not be included.</p>

<h3>My Experiences with Using National Products</h3>
<p>— Ms. Li Xia</p>
<p>I can honestly say that among the students in the school, I am the only one who is so firm. In last year's "National Products Year," I firmly decided on a "three no's" principle: one, no using foreign goods; two, no marrying foreign young masters; and three, no befriending people who use foreign goods. This year, when it was changed to "Women's National Products Year," it further increased my determination. Of course, in this short period of time, I don't have much experience to talk about, but I will just write some facts to show my responsibility for the "National Products Movement."</p>
<p>I was originally a village girl, and at that time, I purely wore earth cloth woven by my mother's own hands. Later, for the sake of my further education, I moved to the city to live. Of course, the city is like a Westernized pot, and anyone who steps in will be affected. As a result, my mother no longer weaves cloth herself, and our family's consumption gradually became Westernized. I didn't realize that I had unknowingly become a salesperson for foreign goods. At this time, I deeply felt that this kind of action was an unforgivable crime, but due to environmental reasons, I just followed them. Last year, Dr. Shao Shuangqiu suddenly made a passionate call to promote native goods to save the country, which made me feel sad and reminded me that I had become a thief in the domestic goods industry. So I firmly joined the Nian Er Society organized by Dr. Shao and vowed to use domestic goods to the death. With my passion, I tried my best to promote it and put on the earth cloth clothes I used to wear again. Until now, I feel that the issue of a person using domestic goods completely depends on their own firm determination. It must be done practically and earnestly. Just shouting the tune of using domestic goods will never have any effect.</p>
<h3>My Experiences with Using National Products</h3>
<p>— Ms. Chen Meiyu</p>
<p>It is a golden rule that Chinese people should use Chinese domestic goods. During the "Women's National Products Year," female students should lead by example and strive to promote the use of domestic goods, which is even more a matter of course.</p>
<p>However, since Chinese people advocated using domestic goods, a few profit-seeking merchants often sell foreign goods as domestic goods; some even disguise enemy goods and use them to pass off fish eyes for pearls. The author has been deceived many times.</p>
<p>Since the appearance of shops and companies that specialize in selling domestic goods, the author must go to domestic goods shops and companies to purchase daily necessities, because domestic goods shops will never mix in foreign goods or enemy goods.</p>
<p>Also, for the same daily necessities, there are various domestic goods products. Which one is most suitable for our needs? Which goods and prices are most appropriate? It is not enough to just ask around and research. Therefore, among the author's classmates, there have been discussions and research on a domestic toothpaste and soap for several weeks before deciding on the purchase standards.</p>
<p>Moreover, because our country's industry is still in its infancy, there is a great lack of various chemical raw materials. The domestic goods currently circulating on the market still mostly obtain their raw materials from imports, and only the mixing and manufacturing labor is done by Chinese people. Therefore, when we purchase domestic goods, we must also pay attention to the source of the goods' ingredients and be sure to choose pure domestic goods and those that contain the least amount of foreign materials, so as to comply with our purpose of using domestic goods.</p>
<p>Based on the author's experiences with using domestic goods, I would like to contribute three things to the business community:</p>
<p>(1) I hope that leaders in various industries will actively establish domestic goods companies in various places to facilitate the purchase of domestic goods by those who love them. Before domestic goods companies are widely established, I hope that each industry can open up a domestic goods department to benefit customers.</p>
<p>(2) I hope that when manufacturing supplies, each factory will try its best to reduce the use of foreign materials. I also hope that the number of foreign and domestic materials used will be clearly indicated so that purchasers know what to choose.</p>
<p>(3) I hope that each factory can truthfully explain the usage and efficacy of each product and not make deceptive remarks. Prices must be modest, but not too low to lose people's trust.</p>

<h3>Sightseeing Report on the Summer Fashion Carrying Platform Lantern Parade</h3>
<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>One day, a friend from the China National Products Company told me this: "I'm reporting a piece of good news you've never heard of. Starting from June 1st, our company and the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory will jointly hold a Summer Fashion Carrying Platform Lantern Parade. Inside there are girls' fashions, story lanterns, advertising running lights, etc." I asked happily, "Is it on the third floor or the fourth floor?" He said, "No, no, it's on the second floor of the market, running in a circle." I said, "This is truly unprecedented. I've only heard people say that a Daoist temple is made in a snail shell, but I've never heard of a parade in a company." He said, "That's the amazing thing."</p>
<p>A burst of melodious music calmed the voices down, and the parade gradually moved out of the company's storeroom. It took about half an hour to see the entire team.</p>
<p>The purpose of the parade is to promote the beauty of domestic summer clothing materials. How can summer fashion suit a woman's nature? The clothing featured this time includes: "Formal Dress," "Casual Dress," "Evening Dress," "Banquet Dress," "Garden Party Dress," "Home Dress," "Beach Dress," "Sports Dress," "Sleepwear," and dozens of other types. The materials are from Mei Ya, including: "Red Snail Embroidery," "Phoenix Ritual Gauze," "Er Qiao Crepe," "Roman Crepe," "Double Crepe," "Fragrant Silk Gauze," "Printed Georgette," "Plaid Georgette," "Striped Georgette," and "Tulle Crepe." There are ready-made phrases to evaluate these many different fashions and fabrics: "Fits the figure," "Length is appropriate," "Flows elegantly," and "Exquisite beyond compare." It is said that the garments are manufactured by the New Clothing Department of the China National Products Company.</p>
<p>There are also other lanterns, which can be divided into: "Carrying Platforms," "Cup Lanterns," and "Object Lanterns." The carrying platforms include: "Mulan Joins the Army," "Daiyu Buries Flowers," "Baochan Sends Wine," "Mingfei Departs for the Frontier," "Diaochan Worships the Moon," etc. The cup lanterns include "Hundred Flowers," "Embroidered Ball," "Spirit Dragon," "Flying Phoenix," etc. The object lanterns include: "Big Goose," "Standing Crane," etc.</p>
<p>In summary, there were tens of thousands of visitors in the four days. It can be known that many female visitors gained some understanding: "To know that Chinese goods also have such good summer clothing materials and can make suitable fashions." I think that this action of the China National Products Company is not without value.</p>

<p>Summer is here again! The fierce flames shot out by the scorching sun, and various poisonous insects and bacteria are also taking the opportunity to move. "Armed flies during the day, leading a large number of poisonous bacteria, arbitrarily disturbing; bedbugs and mosquitoes at night, using the darkness to suck human blood: there are also germs lurking everywhere that transmit epidemics. If we do not find a way to eliminate them early, then the future disasters are truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>We know that ditches, corners, garbage piles, toilets, etc., are the headquarters for the collection of poisonous insects and bacteria. The only way we can defend ourselves is to use the domestic product "Yalin Disinfectant Odor Water" and pour it into their headquarters to kill all the poisonous insects and bacteria! This method of eradicating the roots can allow us to safely spend this terrible summer.</p>
<p>The domestic product "Yalin Disinfectant Odor Water" is a fine product of Wuzhou Pharmacy. The quality is thick, the medicinal power is sufficient, and it has been praised by people across the country and various health agencies for many years. Therefore, whether it is a public place or a large or small family, to seek life safety, we must prepare domestic "Yalin Odor Water" for sprinkling.</p>
<h3>An Irreconcilable Conflict</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>There are now two people, A and B, who have a deep hatred. If there is A, then there is no B. If there is B, then there is no A. This is an "irreconcilable conflict."</p>
<p>I feel that the current "domestic goods" and "foreign goods" are also like two people, A and B, who have accumulated an "irreconcilable conflict"! If there are "domestic goods," then there are no "foreign goods." If there are "foreign goods," then there are no "domestic goods." In other words, if "domestic goods" sell well, "foreign goods" can disappear. If "foreign goods" sell well, "domestic goods" have no way out!</p>
<p>Seen in this way, "domestic goods" and "foreign goods" are already in an "irreconcilable conflict." Then, we should strive to promote "domestic goods" and quickly overthrow "foreign goods." Otherwise, if "foreign goods" are not overthrown, the crisis for the future of "domestic goods" is unimaginable!</p>

<h3>Stone and Water</h3>
<p>— Xuanming</p>
<p>If the foundation of a nation is built upon bedrock, then all internal and external troubles can be regarded as dragonflies attempting to shake a stone pillar – inconsequential and painless. However, if this foundation is like the girls in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, "made of water"! Then not only dragonflies, but even a small mosquito can move it.</p>
<p>Alas! How numerous are those who disturb the world. The emotions of mankind are mostly universal: a love of life and fear of death, bullying the kind and fearing the wicked, and a widespread belief in ghosts and spirits. Good people are few and evil people are many, those who love the light are few and those who love the darkness are many – this is consistent across both hemispheres. 丨丨Let me cite a recent event as an example: German Police Chief Weizo recently intensified his punishment of Gypsy women and has issued orders to apprehend all sorcerers, alchemists, and astrologers.</p>
<p>This is solid proof of a firm foundation of stone!</p>
<p>But what of China's superstition? Setting aside the esoteric sects in the court, the superstitions among the common people alone are quite sufficient. Based on the baseless talk in one or two versions of "Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified," blood-drops can be used to verify father-son relationships, thus bolstering the practice of feng shui. Because several men of letters exaggerated their origins in the past, and because emperors throughout history used divine authority to control their slaves, people still foolishly believe in face-reading and the interpretation of the Eight Characters, and now there is even "scientific spirit writing." The *Book of Changes* is clearly a book of philosophy, but it is still used today as a textbook for the "Wen Wang Oracle Divine Lessons." Divination with the *Book of Changes* was condemned by Song Confucians. However, its influence is actually greater than that of the math textbooks approved by the Ministry of Education. Just look at what is posted on the walls of the streets, what is published in the newspapers, and listen to what is talked about in the streets and alleys, and you will know in what century the spiritual life of the Chinese people exists!</p>
<p>This shows that China is not made of stone, but of water.</p>
<p>I have heard that in the past there were things like "Vajra Zen," and so-called Daoist magic that could summon wind and rain and turn stones into gold. The doctrinal basis was the *Diamond Sutra*, but the sentence was punctuated like this: "This Dharma! Is equal, without high or low." This not only chills the monks' teeth, but also makes scholars shake their heads. However, this harmed localities and disturbed the people, and was no small matter at the time.</p>
<p>Superstition, whether big or small, is a festering sore on society! Transport the feng shui masters, fortune-tellers, and face-readers to the Northwest by airplane to open up new land; send all the monks and Taoists to colonize the border in Tibet, and at the same time escort the Panchen Lama back to his hometown. Only then can we talk about "citizens" and "the Republic of China"...</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from Yaokeng: One</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>Those who have lived in Jilin probably all know about Yaokeng, right? What is Yaokeng? It is a large earthen pit left over from digging soil for burning bricks in the past. In Jilin, there are three Yaokengs in total, all located in Dongguan. One is outside the Xinkaimen on the side of the main road opposite the Japanese Consulate, and the other two are on either side of Chaoyang Street outside the Dadongmen.</p>
<p>The area of Yaokeng is very large, which shows how many bricks and tiles were used in the construction of Jilin City in the past. Now, after a long time, tall trees have grown inside the pit.</p>
<p>Yaokeng is at least ten feet below the ground level. The lowest place is eighteen or nineteen feet from the ground. Such a large pit should have been left deserted, but in reality, it is not. Instead, many families live there. However, they are not wealthy residents. Most of them are rickshaw pullers or small-scale laborers丨丨some manual workers. They live here because the rent is much cheaper than the houses on the ground.</p>
<p>In the summer, whenever it rains continuously, pools of water accumulate in the pit, but they never flood the houses in the pit, because the foundations of the houses are two or three feet higher than the water accumulation area. This is not an annoying thing. What makes the people living in Yaokeng unhappy, and at the same time cannot be removed, is the dirty water that mixes with rainwater and pours into the pit from the ground. This dirty water seems to have seen that the feng shui of Yaokeng is very good and has chosen it as its final resting place, and always rushes over there as if competing with each other. This brings a strong, fishy, and foul odor that floats and emits and never dissipates elsewhere.</p>
<p>Speaking of the climate, there is also a big difference between Yaokeng and the ground level. For example, in summer, the pit is much hotter than the ground level, because the cool breeze is not willing to patronize such a low and humid place easily. After entering winter, the frozen ground and the solid ice formed by accumulated water on the pit walls absorb the heat, and the climate is twice as cold as the ground level.</p>
<p>Those with money don't live in Yaokeng houses,</p>
<p>Not warm in winter,</p>
<p>Not cool in summer.</p>
<p>This is a short song that best describes the climate of Yaokeng.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, wars frequently broke out in the Northeast countryside, and people could not live in peace. Therefore, people with some assets, generally small bourgeoisie 丨丨small landlords 丨丨all fled to the cities to live. The Yaokeng, a nest for the poor, has added many rural gentry and landlords. As for the house prices in Yaokeng, it is said that they are now two or three times more expensive than before.</p>
<h3>Citizens丨Police丨Bandits</h3>
<p>— Poyu</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that the salt rush in the Jiaozhou area had expanded, with about four or five hundred people rushing to grab salt, including women and children. On the night of May 20th, the salt police used force to stop them, arresting a large number of women and children, while the strong men fled. On the night of May 21st, the salt police used force again: the salt-grabbing people fought back, injuring one salt policeman and killing three people. One person was arrested and sent to the bureau. According to the confession: Farmers in the Xin'anji area specially invited more than thirty remnants of Liu Guitang's bandits from Dazhu Mountain to assist the farmers in grabbing salt. When encountering the police, the bandits resisted. For each basket of salt grabbed, the bandits were paid one jiao. Ma Xiaolu, the chief of the Qingdao Tax Police District, urgently took twenty policemen to Jiaoxian on the 23rd to mobilize more than two hundred salt policemen from various districts, and invited more than one hundred members of the militia from Jiaoxian. County Magistrate Zhou arrived at Hongshiya on the 23rd to search and suppress Xin'anji.</p>
<p>When I first read this, I couldn't understand it no matter how hard I tried. We only know that the police protect the people and the bandits harm the people. Now, it can be openly read in the newspaper that the people are fighting the police and seeking help from the bandits.</p>
<p>According to what the elders have passed down, what the newspapers have published, and what history has recorded, bandits are murderers and arsonists, cruel and tyrannical people. But now they are cooperating with farmers. Such a strange thing would probably make even fashionable ladies gasp in astonishment.</p>
<p>To understand this strange event, it must be explained: First, the reason for grabbing salt is very simple. A certain Shanghai evening newspaper has already made it very clear in its general heading: "Salt tax is too heavy to bear." As for how heavy the salt tax is, we in remote areas seem unable to know the details, but according to the record of "paying the bandits one jiao for each basket of salt grabbed," it is not difficult to imagine that the salt tax exceeds this number many times. Because if the difference is not much, who would take the risk, including honest farmers, young and weak women and children?</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>"Grabbing" originally means attacking with force and taking by force. Seven or eight robbers robbing a wealthy family still have organization beforehand, not to mention that now four or five hundred unarmed people are going to rob the official residence with firearms. Even if the farmers are foolish, how could they bring "a large number of women and children" to seek death? Therefore, I am afraid that the four or five hundred people who went to the official residence on the night of the 20th were crying and arousing the "salt police's use of force to stop them" (?). As a result, the women and children who could not run were all arrested. In this way, the logic and reason behind the "salt police using force again on the second day, and the salt-grabbing people fighting back" can be imagined in the previous student petition events. What is the salt camp's force? What is the people's counterattack? Therefore, three people were killed, and the salt police seemed to have to say that one was injured. Thus, under the "killed" word that Zhang Xiaoshuai was accustomed to using, the farmers went to seek help from the bandits with guns.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>This happened in Shandong. The Shandong Chairman Han Fuju has always been known as a "blue sky grand master," with a cloud of chivalrous heroes under his command who specialize in fighting injustice. I have not heard of any "arriving upon hearing crying" regarding this matter, which is very confusing.</p>
<p>The proposal to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies at the fiscal conference was unanimously approved. If this power does not extend to "County Magistrate Zhou arriving at Hongshiya," then it would be good to send a telegram to appeal! (May 29, 1934)</p>
<h3>A Brief Note on Visiting the Yifeng Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>The first national painting exhibition organized by the Yifeng Society opened on the afternoon of the 3rd at the Chinese Art and Crafts Society on Avenue Améglot, French Concession, Shanghai. As soon as I entered, I bought a copy of the "Yifeng" special issue. Opening it up, I saw that it not only had more than a hundred pictures and about 40,000 words of essays, but even the catalog and portraits of the exhibitors were bound together. The catalog listed as many as 747 works. According to Mr. Sun Fuxi (one of the people in charge), more than 100 works were received after the catalog was published, for a total of more than 900.</p>
<p>The Yifeng Society, as a private group, has actually been able to get submissions from Nanjing, Beiping, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuchang, Xiamen, Guangzhou, etc. The scope is undeniably broad. Generally, other painting exhibitions set a fixed scope: either a school, a group, or a school of painting. Except for works related to this school, this group, or this school of painting, other works are not solicited. The Yifeng Painting Exhibition is different: it first eliminates sectarian views. It believes that a scholar should of course have a central idea. If someone expresses sympathy for this idea, that is of course very good. If not, there is no need to force others to be the same as him. Further, from the standpoint of the entire society and from the standpoint of national culture, what is needed is not just one school, one group, or one school of painting; but multiple schools, multiple groups, and multiple schools of painting. This view is correct.</p>
<p>Since the number of works in the Yifeng Painting Exhibition is so large, and its content is also rich, the four female painters in the exhibition: Fang Junbi, Pan Yuliang, Sun Duoci, and Shi Renyu, have already been commented on by Ms. Huiyin in the "Torch" section of the Dawan Daily on the 2nd. My personal feelings about the four are the same as Ms. Huiyin's, so I will not discuss them further. The colleagues from the Hangzhou Art Academy, Lin Fengmian, Cai William, Li Puyuan, Wu Dayu, Fang Ganmin, Lei Guiyuan, Ye Yun, and the sculptor Liu Kaiqu, etc., have a common trend, which is "the expression of strength." In the "Yifeng" special issue, Mr. Li Puyuan wrote an "Introduction to the Colleagues of the Hangzhou Art Academy," which can be consulted. Xu Beihong, Pan Yuliang, Gu Liao, Li Zhuzi, Li Yishi, Chen Zhifo, Zhang Shuqi, etc. of the Western Painting Group of the Art Department of Nanjing Central University, all presented many powerful works, which were exceptionally wonderful. Wang Yachen, Wu Hengqin, Zhou Bichu, Yang Xiutao, etc. of the Shanghai Xinhua Art Academy also participated in the exhibition with works that have reached a high level. Wu Zishen's traditional Chinese paintings, Yan Wenliang's landscapes, and Huang Juesi's Western paintings from the Suzhou Art Academy each established their own style. Zhu Wenyun, Wu Fuzhi, Pan Tianshou, Zhang Shuqi, and Zhang Zhenduo, colleagues from the White Society, also participated one after another. Wang Qi, Zhang Yuguang, Jing Tingyi, etc. were also happy to exhibit their works. A posthumous work by Mr. Gao Qifeng is even more valuable. Lang Lusun exhibited several sculptures; it is said that a recent work was unfortunately broken during the molding process.</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw Gets Tricked</h3>
<p>— Jiamao</p>
<p>The great British writer George Bernard Shaw, as everyone knows, is a top humorist who specializes in making fun of people. Who would have thought that he would recently be tricked once? This is what happened recently in Detroit, England. Recently, an American named Kenneth R. MacDonell went to him, saying that he admired George Bernard Shaw's great name and wanted to ask him to write an original work in his own handwriting: the condition of remuneration was one US dollar per word. In the eyes of old man Shaw, this remuneration was not generous, and he had to write it himself, which he considered to be a difficult task, so he did not agree at first, but he still regarded MacDonell as a publisher, so he also dealt with him quite perfunctorily.</p>
<p>A few days later, MacDonell sent George Bernard Shaw a letter, saying that he was now managing a digestive pill, and he believed that if he could use George Bernard Shaw's original handwriting and his great name as a trademark, it would definitely sell well. He believed that it was permissible to use George Bernard Shaw's name. If Mr. Shaw thought that the remuneration of one dollar per word proposed the day before yesterday was too little, there was still room for discussion.</p>
<p>This was really "something." George Bernard Shaw was very unhappy after receiving the letter, believing that he had deviated from the position of humor and was close to insult. So he wrote back to reject MacDonell, saying very sternly in the letter:</p>
<p>"......If you dare to use my name in that way, I will definitely do my best to use the law to deal with you. You must be careful......"</p>
<p>In this way, he finally used a nail to hit the rude businessman. Who knew that MacDonell was overjoyed after receiving the letter, and treasured George Bernard Shaw's original letter as a treasure. Because his hope had been fulfilled. His hope was to get George Bernard Shaw's scribbled signature:</p>
<p>"Faithfully G. Bernard Shaw"</p>
<p>Because it is usually very difficult to get George Bernard Shaw's autograph. This time, he was provoked and angered, so he had to write back himself to vent his anger. Thus, old man Shaw was tricked once.</p>
<h3>Fire Disaster (3)</h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>"Bah! He, what business does he know! He only relies on a good backing. For the sake of his father's face, Guanglong Company in Singapore has lent him tens of thousands of dollars in the past two years, otherwise, it should have been closed long ago. 丨丨For example, a month ago, the price of rubber suddenly rose by two jiao, and he rushed to buy it as if he had picked up a treasure. I saw that this kind of market did not have a good market price, and there must be other temporary reasons for this raised price? So, he rushed to buy it and let him buy it. I just didn't buy it. What was the result? A batch of goods was sent to Singapore. The price fell, and he lost more than a thousand dollars at once. You think, how can you get back more than a thousand dollars in this kind of market? He lost it for nothing! But I didn't lose a penny. Hmph, what business does he know how to do!" My relative showed that he was a good old man at business, and said with a very smug look, and despised the young industry on the third floor next door.</p>
<p>Fuhe Company and Qunxing Company are jealous of each other, which has been going on for many years. Fuhe has a strong capital, while Qunxing has produced talents. 丨My manager uncle is a famous figure in the business world!丨丨So, there has always been a struggle between you and me, competing for customers. When one side earns money, the other side is jealous; when one side loses, the other side claps their hands and cheers. If you talk about the other side in front of them, they will only talk about their own strengths and expose the enemy's flaws.</p>
<p>"It's too hard to do business now." I said lightly and casually, feeling a little dazed in my heart.</p>
<p>"That's right." Then he yawned. His brow furrowed, as if something was hanging on his mind. I realized and said:</p>
<p>"Uncle, did I just disturb you from your nap? I remember that uncle has the habit of taking a nap, please go ahead! I'm really sorry to disturb you!"</p>
<p>"That's not the case. These days, I canceled the nap because of the number planning. But there was just one thing that I was discussing with Ah Mei (that's an assistant of my uncle, who is also very good at abacus.). Well, I won't accompany you. Anyway, it's my own relative, it doesn't matter. And I can send someone to notify your old friends and say that you are here, so everyone can talk and reminisce about the ten years of separation."</p>
<p>"Yes, please go ahead! We are family, don't be polite. I can also go and sit there."</p>
<p>So, this resourceful businessman walked out slowly. When he went out, I saw that his face was very solemn and his brow was tightly furrowed. I thought there must be a major thing hanging on his mind. This attitude would not have been seen ten years ago.</p>

<h3>Securities: Speculative Focus Shifts to "Whole Sixes" - Market Jumps Up Yesterday by 1.5 Yuan - Gold Short-Term Peak at 71.05 Yuan - Almost Nearing the High-Ranking "Disbandment"</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw no respite in the bullish market sentiment. Market prices were not swayed by unfounded rumors. Various merchant groups showed strong buying interest. However, a portion of attention shifted to "Whole Sixes" (likely referring to a specific type of government bond) due to the significant price difference compared to other public bonds. However, since the lottery drawing period is still over a year away, although gold short-term bonds reached a new high of 71.05 yuan, the comparison only shows a difference of three to four dimes. "Whole Sixes" soared by 1.5 yuan, and the trend remained consistently strong, with prices increasing steadily. The strong buying enthusiasm was truly astonishing. Based on the strength of the trading floor and market sentiment, further price increases are expected. Although rumors exist, they are not expected to significantly harm public bonds. The rumors of a Russo-Japanese war came at a time when the Japanese government seemed on the verge of collapse, making a sudden conflict unlikely. Superficial observers are prone to making costly mistakes. As market prices rise, more short sellers enter the market, and the more short sellers there are, the less likely prices are to fall sharply.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading began with a slight improvement of about one dime in the initial session. Afterward, starting with the 20th-year bonds, signs of fatigue gradually appeared, and gold short-term bonds also decreased slightly by one dime. "Whole Sixes" stood out with a unique surge of three and a half dimes, which strengthened market confidence. The second session saw a continued rise, with gold short-term bonds and "Whole Sixes" increasing by about half a yuan, while others only improved by five to ten cents. When the afternoon session opened, demand from various merchant groups remained strong, with further gains ranging from ten to forty cents. The highest price for gold short-term bonds reached 71.05 yuan. At the closing bell, many long positions on the trading floor were slightly closed out. The prices of the front row showed a slight fatigue of five to ten cents, while others remained unchanged. "Whole Sixes," however, increased by another 1.5 yuan, maintaining a very robust position, and trading became increasingly active. As a result, market prices continued to trend upward, mostly by three to four dimes, with "Whole Sixes" experiencing a wild surge of 1.5 yuan. However, the current month's bonds of "19th-year Guan-shan 20 Rolls" and "20th-year Guan" decreased by five to fifteen cents, indicating uneven performance. The total transaction volume reached 16,411,000 yuan. A comparative table of price increases and decreases is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction volume: hundred yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Advances Rapidly</h3>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (the 5th), the New York stock market was affected by rumors of inflation. Mining and silver stocks continued to advance, leading the price increases, and trading was somewhat active. Some speculators deeply believe that the government wants to prevent a sharp fall in commerce and prices by continuing to inflate the currency, making it necessary. Therefore, they believe that the President will raise the price of gold after Congress adjourns. Due to favorable news of foreign harvests and inflation rumors, buyers eagerly purchased grains, causing prices to soar. This also benefited the stock market. The small exchange rose, and bonds were mixed with slight declines. (Securities) The news was good, and the market advanced rapidly in light trading. (Wheat) The selling by long positions has been completed, and new purchases are not numerous. However, the public gradually believes that the rain has come too late and that it would be advisable to buy when prices fall. Weather reports indicate that there has been rainfall and cooler weather in the wheat-growing regions, but the harvest situation remains poor. (Cotton) Rumors of raising the price of gold, the firmness of various markets, the scarcity of transactions, and complaints about rainfall in the East have all made the market firm today. The yarn market is quiet, and it is said that it has not followed the price increases of raw cotton. (Rubber) The market is brisk, benefiting from scarce supply and rumors of raising the price of gold. (Sugar) The market is firm due to the passage of the tariff bill and the preferential tariff on Cuban sugar. Traders believe that this may be beneficial. The weather is dry, and there is concern that the sugar beets in America and Europe may be damaged. (Silver) The market remains sluggish. The total transaction volume for the day was 740,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Finance: Premium Falls by 9.5 Yuan - Britain Refuses to Pay Expiring War Debt to the U.S. - Thomas Introduces Silver Amendment</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday fell immediately upon opening due to news of rising silver prices and Britain's decision not to pay its war debt to the U.S., as well as the U.S. government's allocation of large sums to relieve the drought disaster, as detailed in newspapers. Subsequently, market confidence wavered. With poor telegraphic communications, major players aggressively sold off, breaking the 20 yuan mark, and the trend became extremely weak. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in Britain and America unanimously rose, and the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange also increased. Although exchange rates showed little change, and London raw gold rose by ten pence, American cotton soared by 28 pounds, American wheat rose by 0.75, and stocks also jumped. Market sentiment was timid. In addition, news reports indicated that Britain rejected America's demand for repayment of the war debt, and that President Roosevelt discussed with key agricultural figures the allocation of 500 million yuan from the Treasury to relieve the drought in rural areas. The market opened at 234 yuan. Afterwards, it continued to decline. Although the situation appeared weak after opening, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing indicated that Britain and America were both even, resulting in many positions hovering around one yuan. Later, a Reuters dispatch reported that the U.S. government also announced that it would issue huge amounts of bonds and that Roosevelt had requested several agricultural relief measures in the current Congress. Market confidence remained stable and was not affected. However, when the Associated Press reported that U.S. Senator Thomas had proposed a silver amendment to the Senate, which included declaring silver as an important currency, eliminating the 50% silver profit tax, and issuing silver certificates, and that Republicans were expected to support the amendment, adverse telegrams caused a break through the 20 yuan mark and triggered a selling frenzy. Major players aggressively sold off, and the situation became extremely weak, but banks were still willing to intervene, and the situation eventually stabilized. However, the overnight silver price in Seattle was reported to be up 125, and then up 25, creating a struggle at noon. The price of pure gold was calculated at 1031.7 yuan. The morning market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1012.12 yuan, down 5.1 yuan from the previous closing. Commodities opened at 2.3 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 3 and a half pence, and American exchange at 32.625 yuan. Yu Qing, Yongda, Kang Yuan, and Chun sold positions. HSBC came out with August American dollars at 9375, falling from 2.4 yuan to 0.09. Huixiang, Yingfeng, Hengqian, Changxiang, and others still advanced and partially recovered, but struggled to rise above 2 yuan, hovering around 1 yuan. However, the domestic market hardened. Great Britain sold September American dollars at 3.0625 yuan. Hengyu, Qingyu, Fuyu, and others all sold, and the price dropped to 19.9 yuan. Dafu and Yongxian advanced and remained even. Anticipating that HSBC would list Britain and America as even, Hengyu, Qian, Changxiang, Fuan, and others deposited positions, and the price rose to 21.4 yuan. Tongtai and Changlai sold, and the price retreated to 0.03 yuan at one point. After banks absorbed demand, the price rose slightly. Hengyu, Tongchun, Dafu, and Yong deposited positions, gradually rising to 1.5 yuan. Afterwards, adverse news, such as the U.S. government issuing large amounts of public bonds and providing agricultural relief, weakened the situation. News that the silver profits tax was being challenged caused Hengyu, Hongli, Shunli, Fuyu, Qian, Changxiang, Dadecheng, Daxing, and Yong to sell, especially Qian Changxiang. It was reported that Chengfengyong also supplied, leading to a break through the 20 yuan mark, falling to 17 yuan. China-Belgium Bank bought September American dollars at 1.875. Dingkang, Fuxing, and Yong advanced to above 8 yuan. The overnight silver price rose by 125. Fuyu aggressively sold, retreating to 7.2 yuan. Duyi supported September American dollars at 0.125. Market confidence was relatively stable. Yu Qing, Yongdingkang, Yingfeng, Hengyuan, Maoyongyi, Yu, and others jointly bought, recovering to 8.5 yuan. Fuyu sold again, Tianfeng also sold off, and the price retreated to 7.6 yuan. Yongfeng bought, and the noon closing was 1017.8 yuan. Commodities were auctioned at 7.9 yuan. After the market closed, Yongfeng, Dalian gang, Yuanmao, Yong, and others successively bought, and the price rose to above 8.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price in the morning was 1022.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 1017 yuan, a difference of 5.4 yuan. As a result, the closing price was down 9.5 yuan from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed American exchange rate, remained unchanged at 32.25 yuan, equivalent to a premium price of 1072.875 yuan. According to the closing price, 55 yuan was deducted, which was more than 9 yuan stronger than the previous closing. The current month's positions have been cleared. The accounting price for July is 1018 yuan. The morning supplement was 1018 yuan. The price of pure gold was calculated at 1031.7 yuan, approximately 9.5 yuan more. The pure gold market was flat. The Tianjin gang's transaction price was approximately 11.5 yuan more. In addition, Eastern goods were approximately 10 to 11 yuan more. The current month's positions have been completely cleared today.</p>
<p>There were more sellers than buyers in the market. In summary, Fudaxingyong, Dadecheng, Ruikang, Hongxing, Futai, Heng Hongkang, Yongda, Changxiang, Yongde, Qingyu, and Hongli were on the selling side. Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongfu, Anhengtai, Dafu, Yonghengyu, Tongchun, Yicheng, Yuanchun, Yongfeng, Bingxing, Yingfeng, Hengshunli, Huixiang, and others were on the buying side. Tianfeng and Qianchangxiang were first advanced and then sold. Yuqing, Yongyuanmao, Yongfuxing, and Yong were first sold and then advanced. It was reported that Chengfengyong also sold. Dalian gang and Wanxing jointly traded over 1,400 positions, netting over 600 positions. Shunli jointly traded over 1,000 positions, netting over 100 positions. The Guangdong gang slightly sold. Hengxing's advances and exits were also small. The total number of transactions that day was 33,299 positions. For the July term, the long positions included Wanxing with over 4,200, Shunli with over 3,200, Tongfengheng with slightly less than 3,200, Yifengyong with over 2,400, Hengyu and Fuan with over 100 each, Yuanyi and Fuchang with over 1,100 each, Yuanmaoyong with 980 positions, Shenyu and Yuanshengyong with over 700 positions each, Run Changyu, Dafengheng, Run Changyong, and Zhaofengchang with over 600 each, and Hengxingyuan with over 500, Yukang, Daxingyong, and Dashun with over 400 positions each. The short positions included Qianchangxiang with over 5,600, Zhengchang with over 2,200, Hengxing with over 1,800, Senchangyong with over 1,600, Yicheng with slightly over 1,500, Dadecheng and Huixiang with over 1,100 each, Tianfeng with slightly over 1,000, Yuqingyong with over 900, Huiyuan with over 800, Ruixing with over 700, Fuxingyong with slightly less than 700, Shenkang and Dacheng with over 500 each, and Chunyuan, Yongbingxing, Shengtian, Yuandayong with slightly over 400 each. The total number of positions was 28,343, with a total of 39 long parties and 58 short parties.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Rebound, Exchange Market Eases</h3>
<p>According to foreign telegraph reports yesterday, London's large positions rose by 1875, the far term rose by 125, U.S. silver rose by 125, the forward silver price rose by 1%, the British exchange rate against the U.S. fell by 375, the U.S. exchange rate against the British rose by 125, the British exchange rate against the French fell by 6 pounds, the U.S. exchange rate against the French rose by 75, and London raw gold rose sharply by ten pence. The private telegraph silver price rose by 125, the exchange rate was unchanged, and the exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 5625, and American exchange at 32.625 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, the British exchange rate eased by 0.0625, while the American exchange rate hardened by 125. After opening, banks immediately absorbed and eased. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listing was announced, and Britain and America were both even, and the situation remained stable. Afterwards, as the news worsened, Chinese merchants repeatedly absorbed and sold, and the situation hardened. However, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to support, and there was much trading in the process. The noon closing near-term selling prices were British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 625, and American exchange at 32.8125 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, the British exchange rate eased by 125, while the American exchange rate hardened by 3125. Chinese merchants supported and then sold, netting approximately 2-300,000 yuan. Chengfengyong and others supported shillings. The French franc for September was absorbed by China-Belgium Bank at 503. The half-day transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>British exchange opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 3 pence 5625. Sassoon and HSBC traded July positions at 625. Shanghai, McCalley, and Youli absorbed positions for the same month at the same price. McCalley sold September positions to Great Britain at 75.

The purchase price added 0.0625.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Business Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Since the end of April, the daily market conditions in the silver and money business have been increasingly quiet, and even more so recently. Although various transactions in the market are not completely idle, most are only seasonal. The interbank call loan rate opened at 9% in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day. Call loan transactions remained difficult, and the degree of expansion could not be curbed, leading to a surplus of funds. No additional water was added to the white call loan. In bill transactions, turnover and new transactions in the morning market amounted to more than 4.2 million, and transactions in the afternoon market amounted to more than 300,000. Transactions in the Small General Association amounted to more than 400,000. In foreign mortgage transactions, more than 900,000 were redeemed, and more than 800,000 were newly made. Bank collections and deliveries continued to decline daily. Foreign banks collected and delivered bill payments of more than 1.3 million, foreign exchange settlements of more than 1.2 million, and various goods, foreign exchange mortgage, and miscellaneous payments of more than 2.8 million, with 600,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Chinese banks collected and delivered bill payments of more than 2.2 million, customs duties of more than 500,000, telegraphic transfer payments of more than 600,000, and various goods, foreign exchange mortgage, and miscellaneous payments of more than 3.9 million, with 200,000 entering warehouses. Japanese banks collected and delivered bill payments of more than 1.7 million, and various goods, foreign exchange mortgage, and miscellaneous payments of more than 3 million, with 400,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Money shops collected and delivered more than 34 million in foreign public notes, foreign call loans of more than 4.4 million, cash collections of 6-700,000, banknote recoveries of more than 900,000, issuance of more than 1.3 million, remittance payments from various routes of more than 700,000, and customer withdrawals of 200,000 with no source. Furthermore, the total exchange volume on the 6th at the clearinghouse was 6,700,350.01 yuan in silver, including 3,655,921.9 yuan in silver coins and 3,047,228.11 yuan in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3>Decline in Subsidiary Coins Remains Uncurbed - Copper Coins Continue to Fall by 2,000 Cash Units</h3>
<p>In recent days, the market for subsidiary coins has experienced a continuous decline due to the large amount of inventory returned. Transaction volumes yesterday were also not strong, so prices did not improve. Jiangnan small silver coins were 834 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 1 yuan from the previous day. Morning market transactions amounted to 6,500 subsidiary coins, and there were no transactions in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins opened at 739.7 yuan in the morning market, an increase of 1.2 yuan from the previous day. However, due to weak trading, the price fell by 1.4 yuan by the afternoon closing, resulting in a net decrease of 0.2 yuan from the previous day. Morning market transactions amounted to 75,000 subsidiary coins, and afternoon market transactions amounted to 45,000 subsidiary coins. Copper coins also continued to decline, falling to 327,000 cash units yesterday, a further decrease of 2,000 cash units from the previous day. The transaction volume was 38,259 strings of cash units, equivalent to 11,700 yuan in silver.</p>
<h3>Grain: 期粉 Flour Futures Rise Slowly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of various months showed a steady upward trend. As the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 1.4 yuan in Chicago and by about 0.04 yuan in Canada, market sentiment gradually improved after the opening. However, the sales customers remained calm as usual. Only external buyers and silver traders continued to absorb large quantities, and market sentiment seemed favorable. However, various factories gradually released their positions, and the prices of various positions flattened again. The price of November flour, however, was supported by external absorption. When the afternoon market opened, it initially remained stable, but as factories continued to sell, market sentiment turned weak. Although external major players continued to absorb, it was purely speculative in nature and could not create continuous excitement. The lack of interest among industry insiders was due to the excellent harvest of new wheat. In terms of actual sales, the sluggish rural economy made it difficult to increase real purchasing power, so buying sentiment became even weaker. As a result, the price of the current month only improved by 0.01 yuan, July by 0.01 yuan, August by 0.0125 yuan, September by 0.0125 yuan, and October by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Rises, Wheat Futures Follow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, the prices of various months generally showed a favorable trend. As the price of foreign wheat rebounded by 1.4 yuan in Chicago and by 0.04 yuan in Canada, industry sentiment remained flat at the opening. Part of the new wheat harvest was being reaped, and most would be harvested within a week. Under the current circumstances, the harvests were generally bountiful, which was why industry sentiment was relatively calm. However, external parties, anticipating that the U.S. wheat harvest would be poor and prices would eventually rise, maintained strong buying interest, which boosted the market. As a result, the price of the current month rose by 0.1 yuan, July by 0.04 yuan, August by 0.02 yuan, September by 0.05 yuan, and October by 0.03 yuan. Yesterday, more than 7,000 bags of new wheat arrived, mostly old wheat by train and a small amount of new wheat from the Yangtze River region. The market did not open. Part of it was directly distributed to factories by traders.</p>
<h3>Thin Rice Market Listless, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were approximately 50 suppliers (approximately 7,5-600 piculs of cargo) in the South Shanghai market. Late rice constituted a larger portion, accounting for two-thirds, so sales interest waned, and late rice prices softened. Northern traders sold only approximately 1,000 bags of Qingjiao, Songsi, and Liantang cargo, and both wholesale and retail sales were weak. Market prices continued to adjust. Large quantities of thick japonica rice remained unsold. Fortunately, continued Northern wholesale activity stabilized the market for Suzhou-Tong cargo (2-300 bags). Nancang early rice prices softened slightly. Du Yang and Jian were sold at varying prices, and cargo quality varied. Due to sluggish sales, the market was weak, and prices varied depending on the cargo quality, by 0.1-0.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 21-22 ships arrived at the North Shanghai market. Sales for all types of cargo became increasingly sluggish. White rice prices fell slightly by nearly 0.1 yuan. White japonica thin rice prices remained stable. Sheep Du and Bu Jian prices softened slightly.</p>
<h3>客秈 Customer Indica Rice Arrivals and Sales Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer indica rice was quiet, with both arrivals and sales listless. Total sales were less than 1,000 bags, and arrivals were also small. Transportation from the Yangtze River region was not profitable, so traders were taking a wait-and-see approach. Arrivals from Jiangbei and by train were small and scattered, totaling less than 2,000 bags. There were some stocks on hand, but owners were unwilling to sell cheaply in anticipation of rising prices and strong sales during the off-season. Traders were still shipping the goods that had been traded earlier, intending to buy again at lower prices, so they mutually supported prices, resulting in limited transactions but steady prices. Around 100 bags each of machined Yuan and machined indica rice arrived on Quanjin Street. Approximately 3-400 bags each of machined brown rice arrived from Fujian province. Prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>New Broad Beans and Rapeseed Both Soft</h3>
<p>In previous years, the arrival of new goods would trigger a rush to buy fresh produce. However, due to weak purchasing power this year, no one was eager to buy. There was no so-called rush to buy fresh produce in the first batch, and the softness of the market was evident after the arrival of the third batch, resulting in unstable market conditions. Yesterday, Wenzhou broad beans were the first to fall in price. Although they were duty-free goods, the price was lower than the previous two markets. Approximately 500 bags were traded by Tianjin traders, priced at 2.9-3 yuan. Wenzhou rapeseed also declined. It was reported that 200 bags of duty-free goods were traded at a price of 3.92 yuan. Approximately 500 bags of green broad beans continued to arrive in Minhang, but their quality remained damp and soft. Export traders reluctantly loaded the goods, priced at 4.05-4 yuan, also a decrease of 0.2 yuan. Red and white broad beans opened at the original price of 4 yuan, but these were the second batch of new goods.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Sesame Seeds Transported from Hankou to Shanghai - Awaiting Shipment to Europe</h3>
<p>Recently, more than 6,000 bags of sesame seeds, estimated at approximately 600 tons, were transported from Hankou to Shanghai to await shipment to Europe. It is reported that this large quantity of sesame seeds is being handled by Japanese traders.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestically Produced Quanzhou White Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended weak. The association set the price for 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 20.7 yuan for spot goods, down 0.05 yuan from the previous day. Goods from this warehouse were priced at 20.8 yuan, also down 0.05 yuan. 20 Medium Granulated White was quoted at 20.2 yuan, Dutch Red at 15.9 yuan, Taikoo Sugar B Mark at 20.8 yuan, and this factory's No. 1 Cotton White at 19.2 yuan. More than 300 bags of Chaoqing opened yesterday. Ordinary Jieqing was priced at 12.4-12.3 yuan. Huilaiqing was 11.7 yuan. Gaolong Port Qing rose by about 0.3 yuan, opening at 11.5-11.55 yuan. In addition, 40 bags of Zhenghu Zhuang cotton red sugar were opened, priced at 15 yuan. More than 100 bags of Gaozhi foreign white sugar were priced at 16.3 yuan. After a large batch of Hainan Red was opened, market sentiment improved slightly. Yesterday, several hundred bags were continuously opened, with a slight increase in price, priced at 12.3-12.35 yuan. Jian traders transported 337 bags of Quanzhou white sugar from Quanzhou by the Fudong ship. The quality of the goods was acceptable. Although the color was inferior to foreign sugar, its sweetness surpassed it. The opening price was approximately 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New and Old Orchid Seeds Not Connected</h3>
<p>The sales volume of orchid seeds has recently increased, and the cargo, although of ordinary quality, has been approved for general trade. Yesterday, it was sold out. The remaining cargo is of the lowest quality, not suitable for sale. Therefore, the tradable cargo is out of stock. There are some stocks in the origin, but the asking price is more than 50 yuan, which is not profitable. It is not expected to be transported to Shanghai soon. However, new goods still need time to arrive, and the Shanghai and Hankou market prices will eventually converge.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Pickled Mustard Again Rises in Price</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard has recently been performing well due to vegetarian demand, and the market is tight. 500 jars of customer goods were opened yesterday. High-quality goods reached 25 yuan, and ordinary goods were 22 yuan. Sales among customer traders and local traders are excellent. High-quality goods are sold at 22-23 yuan, and ordinary goods are sold at 19.5-19 yuan, with signs of further tightness.</p>
<h3>The End of Silk and Tea, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoons</h3>
<p>The Linping silkworm market is about to stop weighing. The spring cocoons near Linping have had a relatively good harvest this year. The market has been open for more than ten days, and the quota will soon be met. Fewer goods are arriving on the market. The average price of improved varieties is 25 yuan per sima catty, and local varieties are slightly less than 20 yuan. The silkworm market is preparing to stop weighing.</p>
<p>The Shaoxing cocoon market is coming to an end. The harvest of improved varieties in the four villages of Shaoxing this year has been the best in recent years. The cocoon market has been open for more than half a month, but the price of cocoons is not high. Improved varieties of cocoons are priced at 20 to 25 yuan, and local varieties at 14 to 18.5 yuan. The cocoon market is coming to an end.</p>
<p>Taixian silkworm farmers have difficulty making a profit. The improved varieties of silkworms raised by farmers in various urban areas of Taixian County this year have had a relatively good harvest. Many local silkworms were lost midway. Few cocoon markets have opened, and the price of cocoons is too low. The highest price for improved varieties of cocoons is only 24.5 yuan, and local varieties are priced at 18 yuan. Farmers are finding it difficult to make a profit. The cocoon market in Wuxi is not thriving. The amount of silkworm eggs raised in various cities and villages of Wuxi this year has been quite high, but there are more silkworms than leaves, and the price of mulberry leaves is high, rising to 3.30 to 3.40 yuan per dan. The cost of raising silkworms is not low. After the cocoon market opened, the price of cocoons was not high. The highest price for improved varieties of high-quality cocoons is only 35 to 36 yuan, and local varieties are priced at 20 yuan. Silkworm farmers are losing money and finding it difficult to sell. Many are entrusting cocoon markets to dry the cocoons. The cocoon market is not thriving.</p>
<h3>Cheap Congou Tea Sales Brisk and Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai, controlled by foreign firms, saw exceptionally smooth sales of cheap Congou teas from Hubei, Hunan, Wenzhou, Ningzhou, and Hekou, with prices ranging from 41 to 49 yuan. Market prices were also very firm. The floral tea category was particularly popular in the market. Even inferior local teas saw their market prices rise to 27 or 28 yuan. The reason for the development of sales of this cheap Congou tea and floral tea is actually due to the fact that India, Ceylon, and Java have repeatedly restricted production in recent years, resulting in cleared inventories and high tea prices. High-quality and mid-quality Congou teas from Qimen and Fuliang were still being actively sought by firms such as Jinlong and Jardine Matheson yesterday, but the selling price had fallen by another 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. In addition, there was little change in the market prices of Zhuang tea. However, the market for pearl tea remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Local Nail Factory Reducing Prices to Sell Wire Nails</h3>
<p>Although the volume of transactions for our factory's wire nails has not been high recently, there has still been a considerable amount of retail business. Therefore, factories involved in making wooden boxes, construction, and other industries have been buying a little. As a result, the surface situation is still lively. However, the trend in large-volume bulk business is hesitant, causing anxiety among distributors and manufacturers. Therefore, in order to plan for development, we have no choice but to reduce prices to sell. As a result, the price of Bessemer steel wire nails has been reduced by 6.15 yuan per barrel, which is slightly less than the previous reduction of 0.1 yuan. It is said that various merchant groups in Hankou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and other places sold off more than two years' worth of barrels yesterday, and there are still more than ten groups, including Xuzhou, Jiujiang, Sichuan, and Qingdao, that are still in negotiations.</p>
<h3>The Internal Market for Bamboo Steel Bars is Very Loose</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of bamboo steel bars has been quite strong, and inventories are abundant, causing considerable unease. Therefore, valuations are very loose. The current market price is 140 yuan per ton, but the internal market price is only 125 to 126 yuan. Apart from some additional purchases by construction companies, there is virtually no export trade. According to industry insiders, the market for this commodity is unlikely to develop until autumn.</p>

<h3>On Romanticism and Decadence</h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>Just like the situation in the late Roman classical era, a large portion of young people are gradually trending towards the paths of romanticism and decadence. Regarding the difference between romanticism and decadence, I remember a philosopher once said: "Romanticism is the positive within the negative, while decadence is the negative within the negative."</p>
<p>In the past, Rousseau of France, Schlegel of Germany, and Scott of England all felt that their lives lacked vitality because reality treated them unsatisfactorily. Therefore, their expressions gave rise to literary romanticism. Similarly, the reason why young people tend towards romanticism is also because they feel the harshness of the surrounding environment, which prevents their beautiful aspirations from existing. At this time, they criticize society as being vulgar and unbearable, and their own hearts, whether consciously or unconsciously, seem unwilling to associate with it. When this inner feeling of bitterness and depression arises, it produces romanticism in body and mind. In terms of the body, they indulge in absolute pleasure. In terms of the mind, they use various methods to numb their brains. They transcend reality and tend towards the beautiful dreams of fantasy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is decadence. This is also subject to the control of the environment, similar to the tendency towards romanticism. The difference is that they lack the courage to transcend reality and become romantic, even though they are still dissatisfied with reality. They simply spend their time shaking their heads, sighing, and moaning!</p>
<p>In short, this is the consciousness possessed by every declining petty-bourgeois young person, although some have strong wills, but this is only one or two percent. They do not have the perseverance of the bourgeoisie in their struggle for careers, nor do they have the passionate revolutionary emotions of the proletariat. They can only lament, moan, and numb themselves in negativity!</p>
<p>From this, we can see that both the positive within the negative and the negative within the negative are equally undesirable. To eradicate this morbid state, every young person must have a profound understanding of the current situation of the times, and experience the meaning of life in their own lives. At that time, you will definitely find a path that you would not have discovered before. This path points out the errors of the positive within the negative and the negative within the negative, and further points you towards running to the forefront of the times! Because the life of a person is originally an extremely transparent mirror, which can reflect our needs and also tell us that it is not enough to drag on the tail of the times!</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xuan Zhi</p>
<p>The warm weather of late spring, the gentle sunshine, and the red and green flowers and willows do indeed give people a lot of pleasure and active vitality, but the continuous spring rain, hanging like a curtain in front of the window, inevitably adds to Meixian's heart a sense of depression and melancholy, and rekindles the scars of past sorrows.</p>
<p>Although Meixian is not yet twenty-two years old, her precious youth has quietly passed away. The deep wrinkles on her brow seem to be inscribed like epitaphs, recording the wandering life she has struggled to survive for several years. When her life problems cannot be solved, she always sighs like this: "Is this life? It would be better to commit suicide!" However, she never has the courage to carry it out, because she still cherishes her mother's love.</p>
<p>The light emitted by the street lamps standing in the rain is particularly dim, like the eyes of a sleepless person, blankly covered with a thin mist.</p>
<p>About five or six years ago! The sky was also so dark, with no moon and no stars, and the air was full of moist water vapor. The drizzle stopped and started. It was at this time that she bid farewell to her loving mother, who was hanging with tears, and quietly followed her neighbor, Sister Ying, to Shanghai on a ship heading east to study.</p>
<p>Her family was originally very simple, with only a brother and a younger brother besides her parents, and her father was the head of the village. In this small village, their lives were considered the most affluent.</p>
<p>However, her parents' minds were very outdated. Although he passed the imperial examinations at a young age, his consistent argument was that "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue," and he absolutely would not allow Meixian to leave her hometown to study outside. When he saw Miss Ying, a neighbor, returning from Shanghai for school holidays, wearing a black silk skirt that was no longer than knee-length, he would always shake his head and say the worn-out old saying "The world is going downhill."</p>
<p>For the sake of her studies, Meixian had cried bitterly behind her father's back countless times. Her mother could not bear her daughter's grief and quarreled with her father several times, but the result was only a scolding from her father: "A girl of this age is still allowed to go outside to study. What kind of co-education is that? It's really outrageous." Shaking his head and stomping his feet, he went to his study to smoke opium in anger.</p>
<p>Although his mother had not attended school or received higher education, and did not have as many of the Confucian and Mencian scriptures hidden in her stomach as her father, she was very capable of understanding all worldly affairs and felt that it was necessary for both men and women to go to school. In the end, she finally took out the money she had secretly saved for more than ten years, regardless of her father's opposition, and allowed Meixian to go to Shanghai with Miss Ying to study.</p>
<p>In a flash of lightning, time flew by in front of Meixian's eyes. Now her studies have come to an end. She is determined to use the little knowledge she has learned in school over the years to serve society, and at the same time solve her minimum living problems. However, the deception, filth, and malice of society, and the fickle nature of people, have made her encounter obstacles everywhere, causing infinite disappointment!</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The summary of the past miserable life, one scene after another, clearly涌上梅仙's brain. So, her head felt a little dizzy and painful. She subconsciously pulled open the curtains and lay weakly on the bed. The night was as silent as death, with only the sound of the pattering rain outside the window and the clock at the small station keeping time in harmony.</p>
<h3>The Wind of Early Summer</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Last year, on a joyous Christmas Eve, Fei, who did not admit that she was a woman but was still a woman, invited her close friends from Shanghai to a dance hall, drank two glasses of strong liquor, and said, "My friends in Guangzhou are waiting for me, goodbye, Shanghai!" That's how we quietly sent her to the ship heading to the South. Although Jun said, "Your friends in Shanghai also need you!"</p>
<p>The second spring when we met passed, and news of her drifted from the South. She said that after arriving in Guangzhou, her life was simply something she had never dreamed of; whether in terms of spirit or material. She stepped on the tropical land and began a vagrant life without a job. The friends she was waiting for did not give her the comfort she needed like the friends who needed her. Although Sichuan is her hometown, she can never leave Shanghai. She said that she would be as peculiar as when she left Shanghai, and throw herself into the embrace of Shanghai on a random day.</p>
<p>Fei, you innocent, passionate girl, I am truly sorry, her shadow no longer exists in my memory. We met and became close day by day, and finally walked that inevitable path, eventually forcing us to leave Shanghai. You never had any Guangzhou friends waiting for her. You could not contain the release of passion, and with the strength of alcohol, swallowed your tears and quietly left. Girl, you must have felt a kind of pain in life! After receiving your letter, I asked the friends who saw you off, but no one had a word about your rice store, Fei, do you resent me, so you sent me that long letter alone? How will I deeply atone for you?</p>
<p>Fei, fellow sufferers on the road of life, we met by chance, how honored we should be! You are a bold woman, we are friends frankly, and in these months of gathering, our hearts feel an indescribable pleasure. You got drunk in my small building, you helped my friend Jun, and on the flat road we had no consideration for men and women; but I don't know, in the end, we will follow into this unfortunate vortex! Fei, you know me, I left my hometown and came to Shanghai for my wife who depends on me for life. You have also had several meetings with her. Regarding your final actions, I have also tried to persuade you with my own emotions, you are still a woman, and I am still a man! When I took away that enlarged photo of you, I didn't expect you to leave Shanghai with the power of alcohol a few days later. Girl, what shall I say? Fei, you are coming back, your friends in Shanghai need you, I hope you leave everything that seems like a dream in your cursed Guangzhou, and when you step on Shanghai, I will return you that innocent, bold girl, just like when we first met.</p>
<p>Jun, the friends you know here are waiting for you, my small building is prepared with soda and White Gold Dragon. Girl, you probably haven't forgotten, a dｅａｒｔ gathering.</p>
<p>The wind of early summer blows into my small building, coming from the South, Fei, I watch the calendar every day, like today is that random day, and an innocent, bold girl is rejoining our group.</p>
<p>Your friends in Shanghai are waiting for you, girl!</p>
<h3>Watching the First Performance of the Ant Drama Society</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>We are very gratified that the drama movement this year is still not entirely lonely. In recent days, we know that there is the Fudan Drama Society's "The Emperor Jones," the Women's Performing Arts Association's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "The Miracle," and this Ant Drama Society's "Jin Bao" and others.</p>
<p>This time is still the first public performance of the Ant Drama Society.</p>
<p>In addition to "Father Returns" and "Moon Rising," there is also a new script, "Jin Bao." It is naturally a good phenomenon that new scripts can be continuously produced, but in proportion, new scripts are only one-third, and "Father Returns" and "Moon Rising" are almost tired of watching. Kikuchi Kan's "Father Returns" was performed in 1934, and it can be said that it has completely lost the significance of the times. Although it is said that in the creation of future scripts, "Father Returns" is still a better one. However, Kikuchi Kan is ultimately a harmonizer from the transitional era. In his original script, the eldest son opposes his father and refuses to support him, but in the end, because of the crying of his mother and younger siblings, he personally goes outside the door to find his father back. Fortunately, in recent years, when it was performed in China, everyone deleted the cowardly and contradictory behavior at the end, making Xian'er always a brave anti-feudal warrior, which is naturally much better than the original. And this public performance is also the same.</p>
<p>However, in terms of performance results, this time was not very successful. The main reason is that the person playing Xian'er is too weak. He does not have appropriate movements to accentuate the mood of the play, and his speech is still too plain. Therefore, the center of the play is on him, and the opposite side does not accentuate the same. Neither the father nor the mother has appropriate acting. This should be the responsibility of the director anyway. For example, in the scene where four people sit around a square table to eat, in Japanese customs, the audience can see the sides of the four people and place the small square table diagonally, but in China, it must be placed squarely in the middle of the room. If the set does not use a diagonal angle, then the daughter Wu is sitting with her back to the audience, preparing to hide the mother. However, this is not without a solution. For example, if the daughter reads a passage in front of the door after seeing her father, and then says it when serving rice, just as she is about to approach the table and sit down, she hears her father calling Zhenniang, which can be much more lively. ...... Such things can prove that the director did not remedy the shortcomings of the play. Among them, several people, led by Ms. Liu Yin, were better, but not as pleasing as in "Ladies and Gentlemen." The lighting did not do a good job of changing from bright to wise, especially the light outside the window was too strong, and there was no feeling of dusk to darkness.</p>
<p>The second play, "Moon Rising," had good results when performed by the Nameless Drama Troupe, with Mr. Wang Ying and Mr. Wei Heling. This time, the person playing the fugitive seems to be lacking a bit, and on the one hand, he conceals himself from the police, and on the other hand, he has to imply to the audience in his movements and facial expressions that he is the fugitive wanted with a reward. This is not what Mr. Wang Ying did. On the whole, we know that the person playing the fugitive does not have sufficient stage training. The person playing the police is better.</p>
<p>In the above two plays, "Father Returns" can almost always win the tears of the audience, no matter how many times it is performed. This is because that kind of old ethics, things, are easily accepted by people with old ideas. Similarly, this time (I saw the last show) there was another girl crying loudly. And "Moon Rising," like "Father Returns," is translated, but the living habits of Westerners cannot be as inherently oriental as "Father Returns" and understood by the Chinese. Especially the Europeanized lines are also not understood by the general audience, so the harvest is greatly reduced. I hope that someone will retranslate it in the future, if we still recognize its abstract significance. Originally, it is more difficult for Chinese people to dress up as Westerners, especially those two young policemen, who have no Western flavor at all. If so, why not change them into Chinese? This point seems to have been mentioned in the second performance of the Nameless Drama Troupe.</p>
<p>Finally, we have to pay great attention to the new script "Jin Bao."</p>
<p>"Jin Bao" is taken from the countryside after a bumper harvest. When I watched the movie "Golden Valley" during the day, it made me find many similarities between the two. That's right, this kind of same theme is really too common at the moment, so the author of "Golden Valley" saw it, and the author of "Jin Bao" also saw it. Here, I am reminded of Mr. Li Ren's accusation in the second issue of "Drama Art" that my "Noble People" was plagiarized from "Midnight." I do not want to defend this misunderstanding, but I explain that the themes in "Midnight" are too common, and it is possible to adopt them without having seen "Midnight." Regarding this point, I have briefly explained it in the single edition of the play to be published by Qianqiu Society, and here I mention the attitude of the critics in passing, because we can never say that "Jin Bao" is plagiarized from "Golden Valley."</p>
<p>Turning back to "Jin Bao" itself, then I admit that the author has indeed seen the true essence of the countryside, but the observation of the phenomenon is still not enough. In this regard, we can feel that the public and bold admission of love between Jin Bao and her lover is not the most common phenomenon in the current stage of peasant families. However, the other characters are quite realistic, although people like Jin Shaoye or those who collect fertilizer powder accounts are a bit excessive. Of course, these are just technical problems of creation, and it is impossible to present living characters on the stage and not achieve 100% effect. Just these, we have to believe that the author can easily correct them.</p>
<p>But for the essence of the problem, we believe that the author has explored the real cause of the disaster of bumper harvest, and pointed out the inevitable future through the correct world view. He explained that years of natural disasters have put the countryside in a state of bankruptcy, and in the year of bumper harvest, due to the exploitation of usury, the oppression of landlords, and the economic invasion of imperialism, they are still in a state of life and death. On the other hand, the author's description of the demolition of houses for road construction and the landlord leading security teams to shoot farmers further illustrates his hatred for the current society. This can prove that the author is facing reality. And can't we see the future of victory from the tragic death of Jin Bao's lover?</p>
<p>Of course, we can also point out many technical deficiencies. In addition to the unnecessary love, at the same time, asking people to dredge up the exemption from dismantling houses should be emphasized a little more, and it should be proposed at the beginning, so as not to feel sudden when it is proposed in the middle. Also, using the father and daughter who play the flower drum to point out "Nine years out of ten are barren... Small households sell their children" also feels uneconomical. I don't know if it is possible to make their father and daughter more important figures in the play. Here I know that the author is for the convenience of performance, afraid that too many people will confuse the stage, so there are always two people on the stage. However, in the last scene, if the people who play the flower drum all support to the end, plus some people, then the final roar should be very tense. In addition, that young peasant only resisted because his lover was taken away, which also feels a bit too heroic, and it is not good that Jin Shaoye scolds the rent collectors.</p>
<p>As for the stage setting, the rural flavor is quite strong, but it is a bit too peaceful. There is not much change in the lighting. However, if the time is supported from dusk to night, and the final scene is made with blazing fire, then I think it would be even better.</p>
<p>The actor who plays the old farmer is the best, and Jin Bao is second. Her lines, the distance between the words is too average, although she can speak clearly and slowly. Other young peasants are not good enough, and Jin Shaoye and the people who collect fertilizer powder accounts are too excessive. The carpenter is still suitable for his identity. We hope that when Jin Bao is performed for the second time, we will see better results.</p>
<h3>A Deformed Society and a City of Contradictions (3)</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhang</p>
<p>Husband works for half a month, the price is ten yuan!</p>
<p>Wife's silk stockings, twenty yuan for a Yuan head!</p>
<h3>On Nanny/Amah</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Although nannies/amahs occupy a low social status and endure much mental and spiritual suffering, generally speaking, their living conditions are often good, at least much better than those of the average working class.</p>
<p>However, there is one essential condition: they must be somewhat refined in appearance and young, preferably also charming and attractive. If they are wrinkled and gray-haired, or if they are young but particularly ugly, then it is a distressing matter. Earning only four or five yuan a month, eating leftovers, sleeping under the stairs, on a triple-tiered bunk, or on a sun deck, and being overwhelmed by mental anguish, is no different from the masses.</p>
<p>Speaking of those who are young and refined, their abilities are often surprisingly great. We only need to pay a little attention to families looking for nannies/amahs to realize that when they go to the employment agencies, they can't possibly discern within ten minutes who is of good character and capable of doing the work. They simply decide who to hire based on their face and figure. Thus, the refined and young ones have a great advantage, being selected at first sight. Then they follow to the mansions of wealthy families, and the master of the house, finding her very pleasing, inevitably seeks to amuse himself with her behind the mistress's back (this is the first step). Further advancement may lead to becoming a secret concubine. When this happens, no matter how stingy the master is, he will always give her some benefits.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are also elderly old men and young masters who are not yet married, who both like pretty nannies/amahs. As long as they are careful and do not let the master see any flaws, they can often proceed very smoothly.</p>
<p>The lives of nannies/amahs who find themselves in such circumstances are mostly quite comfortable. The masters do not consider them to be true nannies/amahs (though they cannot be regarded as true family members either). Good food, drink, and clothing are a given, and they may also ride in cars, hire cars, go to the movies, play mahjong, go to Western restaurants, and chat and laugh together. They only need to take care of some trivial matters, and the heavy work is done by other servants.</p>
<p>Even those who are less attractive to the masters can still gain the favor of people of similar status, such as rickshaw pullers. Although this may not be as good as being involved with the masters, it is not bad either. The rickshaw pullers will invite her to the movies, take her to teahouses, take good care of her work, and may also make extra money on small accounts or even give her extra money. In short, they can gain people's favor, take advantage of opportunities, live comfortably, and not worry about food and clothing. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have noticed particularly that nearly twenty employment agencies near me seem to be opened specifically for nannies/amahs, and there are hardly any male workers sitting in those places.</p>
<p>Shanghai is originally a woman's world, and nannies/amahs are included in it. This is a recent discovery of mine, and it is indeed a social issue that can be studied.</p>

<h3>Home Letter (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mai Fu</p>
<p>At the end of the fourth year, he finally found a small job in a small newspaper office, which was simply a semi-errand position.</p>
<p>"If I have any money left, I can for..." No, I will marry Anhe and Cui..."</p>
<p>This idea always swirled in his mind, day and night. But the reality was not like this. On a snowy dusk one day, he received a letter from home, and his whole soul was immersed in the bitter juice of pain.</p>
<p>His hope was completely gone.</p>
<p>His hope was completely gone.</p>
<p>Suddenly——</p>
<p>He put on his hat, draped his coat, and ran straight to the manager's room like a madman——in the bright electric light, on the sofa, the manager was embracing a prostitute.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Manager——" He shed tears and put the letter in his hand on the table.</p>
<p>"Do you want to go home?"</p>
<p>"Yes——I have an old mother who is about to starve to death..."</p>
<p>"You haven't been here for long, here's ten yuan! Go!"</p>
<p>He went home with the money and put the letter in his pocket.</p>
<p>In the faint morning light, a few passengers stood at a quiet station, and a young man leaned against a telegraph pole, tears falling.</p>
<p>The train entered the station and left again in five minutes.</p>
<p>He chased along the station, just about to grab the handle of the car, and stopped. However, in an instant, he chased and ran again, nearing the body of the car, as if something was pulling him, and stopped again, but, in a moment, he chased desperately again, waving his hands and roaring wildly——</p>
<p>A wavering idea was always beating on his soul.</p>
<p>Suddenly he fell from the bridge, he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>When he woke up, he found that he was lying in the railway hospital, his head and limbs wrapped in white cloth, and some bloodstains could still be seen, his whole body was in pain.</p>
<p>Several people stood in front of him, looking at the home letter.</p>
<p>"Oh! I..."</p>
<p>"Is this home letter your own?" A person of medium stature, like the dean, wearing a suit, said in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's my home letter! I have an old mother! My Cui was sold! My fourth uncle..."</p>
<p>He felt a burst of severe pain, closed his eyes tightly, cried for a while, and finally left this man-eating world. (The End)</p>
