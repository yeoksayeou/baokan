<h3 id="c26">日人準備退出海軍恊約　舒 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>自華盛頓會議迄今十載有奇。在過去十年中。海軍條約。雖無補於世界混沌之大局。亦未能眞正裁制野心國家之暴行。抑止海軍事實上之擴張。然而太平洋上爭霸之風濤。得以暫時平靜者。卽前賴華盛頓條約爲之保障。後賴倫敦恊約之支撑於一時也。</p>
<p>溯自世界大戰閉幕之後。歐洲主要國家。或以戰勝而疲敝不堪。或以戰敗而元氣斵喪。或以革命突起。無暇遠圖。或以國力未充專圖振作。是以均提倡和平之論。一時似有國際合作可以實現之景象。惟遠東方面之日本。則在此大戰期中坐獲漁人之利。國内產業。逐漸向上發達。海外市塲。除東洋方面爲其獨占外。且駸駸乎及於歐西。誠所謂戰爭之暴發户也。當戰爭時期。英美諸國。皆甚感海軍實力之缺乏。故於戰後。有重立軍備方針之必要。而大艦大砲主義。在一九二二年前。已盛行於日美兩國之間。當時競賽之激烈。無異於今日。日本自華盛頓恊約成立以迄現在。未嘗忘情於八八艦隊（無畏式戰鬭艦八隻與巡洋艦八隻）之建設。而五五三比率之成立。雖換得北美合衆國不在馬尼刺關島續建要塞之利益。然日本正因此屈於守勢。不能突飛進展。而祗能爲和平之經濟鬭爭也。</p>
<p>此種經濟戰爭。若不限制輸入。或無關稅壁障。則日本恃其人工之低廉。原料採取之便利。或亦可不必作過量之軍備擴張。詎知在東方發動九一八事變而後。已引起中國民族極大之反感。日本在遠東市塲上之地位。實際已不免動搖。加以英國及其自治領殖民地之限制日貨輸入。美國更以關稅爲抵制工具。所謂霸東亞之企圖。卽在經濟上亦不能不受重重制限。夫以日本之雄心。决不能長受委屈。無如其海軍勢力。僅足以守而不能攻。且太平洋東西相距五千餘海里。有海軍艦隊。固難於遠攻。卽最新之利器｜｜飛行機。恐亦不易飛越。縱使能襲取菲利濱。窺伺香港。亦僅如日人所謂最大不過手足之損傷。而非英美心腹之大患也。</p>
<p>於是日本乃借口補充軍備。竭力擴張軍備。卽海軍第二補充計劃。其建造艦艇與增設海軍航空隊之軍費。其數達七億六千萬日金。建造此三十六艘艦艇。雖名爲補充防禦。其實乃着力於輕巡洋艦潛行艇與飛行隊之發展。情勢酷似大戰以前德意志之所爲。欲挺其新進之鋒銳以駕凌英美。此所以亟亟於申明退出海軍恊約。以爲海軍平等要求之張本也。</p>
<p>英吉利之軍力雖老。然大勢尙可保持。並未十分疲弱。其於建造艦艇之競爭。整興陸軍之努力。未必卽後於日本。觀夫新嘉坡築港之積極。與印度增加關稅之用意。卽可窺知。况其在太平洋形勢中。有左右日美勝算之權耶。美國人民厭惡戰爭之心理。本較歐洲諸國爲濃厚。苟無極大外界之刺激。則所謂軍需工業之設立與轉化。及新艦艇之建造。皆不易見諸實施。頃者日本旣退出海軍恊約。更進一步主張海軍比率平等。則美政府不能不急起力追。激勵其人民。增加海軍軍費。擴大海軍軍備。以與日本競爭。則日本退約之結果。雖謂爲發動第二次世界大戰之導綫亦無不可也。</p>

<p>春秋推上下  拾玖　　「推上下」是中國人的特性。這，隨時隋地可以看得到的。你如有閒的話祗消立在酒菜館門前靜待，便可以　到「推上下」的把戲。一　秀冠楚楚的人走進或踱出那酒菜館的時候，往往你推我、我推你、誰也不肯居先的。這就是所謂「推上下」啊。據說，這種「推上下」，是無形中在守着「德一，爵一，齒一」的三條古訓而行。所以你如果見到年高的人走在前面，便可知在這位老先生的「德」和「齒」是大約有些道理的。反之，你如看見老伯伯反跟在毛頭小夥子的屁股後，則亦不問可知這位毛頭小夥子一定是有「爵」的。有人說，旣然「德一，爵一，齒一，」無形中都有規定、那末又何必扭扭揑揑，做出這種把戲呢？這也不然。雍容揖讓是中國人的美德。不幸歐風東漸，禮敎的藩籬盡撤。倘使這吿明　羊｜｜推上下｜｜還不保存，我們中國還可說是禮敎之國麽？　　還有一種「推上下」，是在車站輪埠可以看得到的。强的推着弱的，少的推着老的，男的推着女的。誰推得過誰，便誰占先。這也是「推上下」。不過這種「推上下」，恰與外國「挨次序」In　order相反；所以這也可以說是中國人的特性。說起「挨次序」，我在中國僅見過一次。從前膠濟鐵路在日本人掌握中的時候，我有一次送客到昌樂。那時看見旅客上下，都能挨着次序，魚貫而行，我以爲奇。後來細細探聽，方知「推上下」是日本人所不許的。　　前一種「推上下」，適合孟子「辭讓之心，禮也」的這句話，我們可以證明中國人的性是皆善的。後一種，如果取荀子「今人之性，生而有好利焉；順是，故爭奪生而辭讓亡焉」的話來説，則中國人的性又是皆惡的。想不到從「推上下」可以悟出性善性惡的哲理來，咦！追還？  宿飯　　我小時不喜讀書，常常歡喜去看喂雞；記得有一天在我在我家雞園裏看一羣雛雞就食，忽的，在雞頭攢動的當中，有一隻黑色小雞啣了一團白飯，從雞堆裏衝出來，昂頭向空曠處狂奔，更有一雞在後面追着，我想恐怕是追的那隻雞力不及？追了一會就不追了。搶飯的黑雞，於是從容的放下它嘴裏的飯團來，正想享用，却被桑樹上停着的一隻老鷹瞧見了；老鷹見小雞，自然像軍閥見了地盤，野雞見了鄕下土老兒，紅頭阿三見了沒照會的小販一樣地儘力來追搏。終算這隻小雞還靈敏，它知道遇暴了，不能再戀它到口的獨食了，棄了亡命的亂竄急呌。　　急呌，追搏，驚醒了墻隅的黃犬，它一個反身，站了起來，不管三七二十一的狂吠，在草裏戲弄蝴蝶的一隻白猫，也來搭起了虎形的架子，朝着入地無門的小雞呼呼的發狠，那時候的小雞，眞是四面楚歌！别無辦法，我看到這裏，不能再作壁上觀了，正想跑去救回那隻小鷄，可是東鄰的小鬍子，已經跨進了我家的藩籬，他一邊驅開鷹，一邊趕開了黃犬和白猫，捉了我家那隻刦後餘生小鷄，跨過藩籬去了，我滿想喊住他，可是我怕他打人，我只有哭着去吿訴我母親，母親說一隻小鷄隨它罷！我家園裏的東西，被這小鬍子强搶硬奪了去的還多着呢！你只要認眞的讀書，將來你書讀成了，有了出息，先去把園裏的圍墻高高的打起來，到那個時候，一一的要他還你好了多這一天，眞的！我終算很認眞的讀了一天。　　過了一個月，我聽見人說，小鬍子這天在吃童小鷄，我聯想到那天的一隻小鷄，於是又去認眞的讀了一天。　　讀書是這樣的沒恒心，所以至今沒有讀成點什麽，也就至今沒錢去打圍墻，也就是至今沒有向小鬍子追債。　　唉！這筆帳不知幾時纔能「追還」？一枝香烟  新華假使把全世界人類吸剩的香烟頭連接起來，那末將變成怎樣長的一條繩子。　　假使把全世界人類所吸的香烟火聚在一起，那末將　去怎樣大的一　森林。　　假使把全世界人類所吸的香烟灰堆積一起，那末將塡塞怎樣大的一條大河。　　假使把全世界人類吸香烟的烟的利用於戰術上，那將迷住多少敵人的眼目。心性之改造  斌性和的人，呌他到郵局或鐵路局去當小務職，一定盛氣凌人，兇如惡鬼。　　性兇的人，呌他到外國人家當西崽，就可馴服得像狗一樣。　　性急的人，呌他去拜訪大人物，坐在會客室裏老等，自會屏息默坐。　　性緩的人，使他在路上和窮朋友談話，必定急着說再會。　　性𤍠的人，請他做慈善事業，管敎他冷了半截。　　誇勇的人，呌他去打土匪，必定臨陣退却，滑脚先逃。　　示怯的人，呌他做汽車夫，就可橫衝直撞，好像勇氣百倍。東北四連長  張恨水第二十回　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息杖游山下冷眼看英雄　　趙翁究竟是個老年人，飽有閱歷，怕他的話，會讓平臺上人聽見了。於是將那根棗木棍子作了拐杖，一步一步的走了開去，臉對了山上望着，好像是看紅葉。積之會意，隨他身後跟了過來。趙翁看着離那平臺遠了，才向積之笑道：老弟台，你眞是直爽不過，怎好在人家面前，就批評這話。積之道：老太爺，您有所不知。那個白臉的軍官，是日本士官學校畢業生，現在當師長，向來自負的了不得，以爲是個英雄。英雄在國難臨頭的時候，就是這個樣子嗎？咳！中國不亡，是無天理。說着，他臉上表示出那憂鬱的樣子，將頭搖了兩搖。趙翁道：我想當軍人的人，不能够都是這一個樣子吧？積之回轉身來，向那平臺上遙遙望着，微微點着頭道：這也難怪。他不但是個師長，家裏還是個財主，大槪有個百十來萬吧？再說：他又年輕。姑娘打扮得好看，不就爲着去換這些嗎？他全有了，女人怎樣的不愛他？趙翁聽他這一番話，却有些擬不與倫。說軍官就說軍官，爲什麽又牽扯到女人身上去？於是微笑道：老弟台，這個年頭兒，不平的事情，那就多着啦。積之將兩手揷在西服褲子口袋裏，斜伸了一隻脚，向那平臺望着，冷笑一聲道：閑將冷眼觀螃蟹，看你横行到幾時？趙翁走近一步，拍着他的肩膀笑道：老弟台，你這番牢騷從何而來？積之道：却是從女人身上而來。他說這話時，臉色可是扳得正正的，不帶什麽笑容。他又道：老太爺，你不知道，古時的美人，崇拜英雄，如今的美人，也崇拜英雄，從前的英雄是有本領，如今的英雄是有本錢。像我們這種書生，女人是不會看在眼裏的。（二九二）人情的𤍠水袋化  定明　　我旣不開京廣大雜貨舗的大亨，或製造𤍠水袋的老　，也不是販販賣𤍠水袋的夥計，什麽「中國」牌拉，「美國」牌啦，「英國」牌啦，「意大利」牌啦，一點不曉得：可是紅·綠·黃·赭，扁扁軟軟地橡皮𤍠水袋我却認識；而且也知道牠的用途，是女人們冷天唯一的伴侶。　　不是嗎？天氣冷了，女人們拿百沸的𤍠水灌進去，抱在懷，橫撫堅摸，一刻不離，那樣的密切；晚上睡覺，或許格外的吻合呢！然而水冷掉，或者天氣𤍠了，便如秋扇樣，抛棄在一邊了；抛棄的時間長短，那是另外一個問題；而同樣屬於抛棄，却是一個方程式。　　這與人情正相同。　　你看伊，用你的時候，好像打不斷的九連環；先是一個一個的媚笑，接着是一聲一聲的軟語對了，伊的第三個步驟可來了！「謝謝你，請你替我……」　　哈哈！到得伊的目的達到了，伊又恢復了伊嬌貴的神態了。伊已忘記了伊先前的大前提之下的小前提：「………我一定送你個應用的東西！」　　其實呢？伊這句𤍠「我一定送你個應用的東西」的說話，還是沸點的客氣語了；倘使不這樣，就只一個一個的媚笑，一個一個的媚笑，一聲一聲的軟語，也已够味兒啦！　　至於臨别的時候，有勞伊的玉趾跟踵在後面，到大門口，你向後轉，大家相向一鞠躬；伊那副淺淺的笑臉，聳聳地肩頭，筆直地兩條臂膊雙垂，同時彎彎腰，點點頭，那更是你所意想不到的表情。　　貼車錢，躭誤工夫；報酬你的禮物在那裏？伊過後那裏還記在心上。正和𤍠水袋一樣，用起了注以沸點的滾水；不用了，如秋扇之被捐；連回顧都不回顧一下子。　　你看這不是人情的𤍠水袋化嗎？笑的總動員兒童的幽默  佩萖▼在鉛筆裏　　父親：「吉兒，拿了鉛筆畫什麽啊」？　　年幼的吉兒：「我畫一隻狗。」　　父親：「狗尾是在那裏呢？」　　年幼的吉兒：「在鉛筆裏，還沒有出來咧！」▼一起洗浴的　　小慧利的父親說：「我想不出這隻表爲甚麽又不走了，恐怕又齷齪了，要揩油咧。」　　小慧利道：「爸爸，不會齷齪的。」　　父親：「你怎知道？」　　小慧利：「因爲今天早晨它和我一起洗浴的。」▼我不吿訴你　　學校裏的女敎員，一手指着黑板上的字，問道：「這是什麽字？」　　學生道：「我不吿訴你。」　　女敎員道：「爲甚麽不吿訴我？」　　學生道：「因爲我來是要你敎我，不是要我敎你而來的啊！」▼要五塊錢的　　校長對龍生說道：「龍生，假使你再不用功，沒有一些進步，我便要請你的家長到校裏來了。」　　龍生是一個醫生的兒子，他聽見了暗笑，說道：「不過你請他來，每次要出診費五塊錢的。」　　▼兩塊蛋糕　　湯兒的父親正在看探險小說，忽然問游兒道：假使你到了一個荒島上，最希望的東西是什麽？」　　湯兒回答道：「最希望有一塊蛋糕。」　　父親再問道：「假使你能够有兩樣東西呢？」湯兒回答說：「兩塊蛋糕。」　　▼媽媽最怕的　　　叔父說道：「你已經長大不少了，將來一定很好的，總可以像你爸爸一樣。　　孩子說道：「不用說了，媽媽最怕我將來像爸爸一樣。」　　▼帮助他不做什麽　　母親在樓上喊道：「下面是誰？」　　有一個小孩回答道：「媽媽！囡囡在這裏。」　　母親道：「你做什麽啊？」　　小孩道：「不做什麽！」　　母親道：「小哥在那裏吧？」　　小哥道：「也在这裏！」　　母親道：「你做什麽啊？」　　小哥道：「我帮助囡囡不做什麽！」短訊  圖南　　頃得京友來燕云，影后胡蝶，與話劇前輩鄭正秋君父子同來此間，寓中央飯店，係應南京大戲院邀請登臺演奏話劇一星期，其劇名爲「笑與涙」「爲國爭光」。同時尙有明星公司導演徐欣夫率男女演員二十餘人，來京攝取「白山黑水美人心」新片，女主角亦爲胡蝶，配角計有高倩蘋，朱秋長，譚志遠，徐莘　諸人，胡女士日間攝片，晚上登臺，誠能者多勞矣，頗聞一輩蝶迷，擬組織捧蝶團，爲胡蝶捧塲，南京大戲院素映國產影片，今由鳳君接盤未久，卽邀得海上大批銀星，惠然肯來，是則該院之發達，可立而待，而久思一　胡女士丯儀者，是又不能交臂失之矣。</p>

<p>自由談砂糖與寳物  致立　　日本有一個傳說，武者小路實篤嘗取其事編爲「狂言」，題曰「莫須有。」大意如下：　　一個老和尙出門時，把一件貴重的東西交給小和尙，呌他好生看守，如有損壞，回來要把他打死。同時又指着放在桌上的一個瓶，呌小和尙當心，說那瓶裏放的是呌做「莫須有」的一種毒藥，吃下去會毒斃的，千萬不可重牠。然而貪嘴的小和尙，却禁不住瓶裏的東西的誘惑，不顧死活地嘗了一嘗，却是甜美的砂糖，於是放心吃去，竟至吃完了，但恐師父回來見責，就把那貴重的東西打碎，躺在地上。老和尙回寺，見這情形，問他爲什麽，他說：「先是因爲不小心，把那貴重的東西打碎了，唯恐師父回來把我打死，倒不如自殺了好，所以把『莫須有』全部吃下，此刻是在等死呢。」　　對於這樣的小和尙，老和尙是沒有辦法了。　　爲了要保全一瓶砂糖，就對小和尙欺之以謊，懼之以死，自以爲得計。然而結果怎樣呢？不但砂糖保不住，甚且損失了更貴重的東西。　　欺騙和恐嚇，原是古往今來許多英雄豪傑所慣用的手段，然而卽使是巧妙的欺騙或極兇暴的恐嚇，效果還是靠不住的，想要保全砂糖而損失貴重的東西的老和尙，歷史上實在不勝枚舉。　　趙高想　二世的位的時候，「恐羣臣不聽，乃先設騐。持鹿獻於二世曰：馬也。二世笑曰：丞相誤邪，謂鹿爲馬。問左右，左右或默：或言馬，以阿順趙高、或言鹿者。高因陰中諸言鹿者以法。　　積威之下的欺騙能使一部分人阿順，但不能使一部分人不反抗，多數的人們雖然沈默、但在沈默中所伏的危機更大。不但此也，在阿順中也有危機，除了詐降的不算，被眞正的阿順者所包圍之後，連自己也要受欺，至於弄不淸馬和鹿的。袁世凱被他的阿順者們所包圍之際，看不到眞正的新聞，所看到的，只是阿順者們自己印成的報紙，那裏面全是可喜的假消息。命運與投機  侍桁　　因爲看見在中國任何地方算命打掛的都不少，於是和友人談到中國人的運命論。不知那友人因何感觸，他說中國人的相信命運是男人欲維持其統治權來欺騙女人的，這話裏的含意我想不出充分的道理，但有些塲合或者是這樣的吧。例如，一個窮秀才討了一個花容月貌的女人，憑女人那點美的資產，生命是該當幸福的，可是事實上却遇到了一個窮酸，事事不如人，日子一久自然不免對丈夫不滿意，由不滿意而致不忠實，可是那個窮酸的秀才呢，自負雖不凡，却總不能够發財，自己也頗以爲苦。但想了許久，也想不出一個道理來，看見旁人遠不如自己的倒高樓瓦房，吃魚吃肉，於是結論道，這是時運不濟，可是又見從前榮華的，現在倒了霉；現在走時的，以後也會塌臺，便更結論道，每人都會走一陣子好運，將來，也許就在不久，這個窮酸說不定便要做大官了！從這種命運論裏面他自己是找出一個希望，使現在活着更有勁兒，如果窮酸能用這話說服了自己的妻，得到她目前安份守己，那實在可以說是男人有意騙了女人了。反之，在那封建的社會裏，我們，時常能够看到所謂三從四德的賢惠的婦人，遇到丈夫不得意的時候，自己却先搬出命運來解勸丈夫，這我們可以說是女人騙了男人麽？　　中國民族是一個迷信最多的民族，所以也最容易相信命運之說，當社會上旣有了專以命運來吃飯的人們之後，那命運之說便更不能够推翻了，這些相士或算命的，像傳敎徒一樣，創造出許多奇蹟，使不相信的人們也要相信他。於是越來越擴大，全國的人都染上點兒運命論者的色彩了·只要看一看我們民族過去的文學上（其實西洋文學上也頗不少的），那被表現的人物和作者的自身，有多少個迷信着運命之說的，便可以證實這話不是誇大的了。　　文學上的運命論有人解說那是因爲人力與自然力鬥爭的結果，人力感到渺小，自然力變成無限的力，於是那鬥爭失敗的人便創造了運命之說。依照這解釋的話，凡是越在人世上鬥爭的人越應該深信命運了？我看，倒恰恰相反，越是倚賴性重無能的人，才越深信命運的。自己在世上活得不舒服，而又無能使自己活的更舒服，總希望藉着某一種取巧的機會來舒服一下，他才會相信運命的。有了命運的機口，他可以作爲現在的倚賴的理由，而且可以去欺騙那希望着他的人，暫且苟安一時。所以雖同是相信命運，也就有相信的程度的不同，在生活裏面眞鬥爭的人，如果也還是相信命運的話，那他是有意騙人的。　　中國的社會最容易養成人們相信命運，那是一無理由的。因爲這社會是最不公平最奬勵投機的原故。社會的過份地不平，養成人們不肯作着眞實的生活的鬥爭，而只希望偷巧藉着某一種機緣來發威作福一下。對於一切事都把精力用到非常不正當的手段上，成就認爲是運氣，不成就說是運氣不到，這運與不運是存在着中國民族的禍患的根源。所以當你在如今的社會上看見那大走其運的人，你不妨就說他是一個最能投機的人東旅跡  劉明　　（一）　　像病了的水牛，一條條躺在荒漠的天野裏，｜這就是雲南東部的山呵，可怕的山呵。　　人家不多，到處都是荒凉的，蕭條的。商人須得成羣結隊的走，並且還少不了武裝的隊伍。本地的山村人，在趕街的日子，荷着土槍去，荷着土槍回來。　　你以爲坡邊割草的漢子，馴良得如同一條牲口嗎？他只要認得你是個單身出門人，衣袋又是沉鈿鈿的，那說不定會來搶你囉……　　過路的小販，當他在樹下息脚，向你討洋火吸烟的時候，就會這樣吿訴你的。　　山路也着實荒蕪得不成路，何况有些路邊的黑松林子，看起來，的確有點使人感到心悸呢。然而，尾着保商隊走，却又日愉快的。一路上，小石塊抛了上去，野梨子，野栗子，那樣的果實，便從樹頭紛紛墜落，全沒誰來管。　　（二）　　保商隊的弟兄，穿着藍色的軍服，也學起大兵的威風，把山裏人拉來挑行李，走三十里，四十里，不給半文錢，却一路上奉以拳和腿。　山地的男子，遇着這批英雄們過路，便偷偷地溜開。　　他們拉不着伕子，就破口大駡，對着遠處　草中閃現的人影，生氣地亂放槍。太古一樣沉寂的山中，　起了野鳥之羣。　　同時，山家屋裏，現在英雄們眼裏的，便全是女人和孩子了。　　「走到女兒國了。」　　「好做駙馬呀。」　　「野男人那裏去了？」　　「一定是躱在婆娘們的褲擋裏！」　　「搜呵！搜呵！」　　保商隊的弟兄，涏着眼睛看女人，吹着口哨子打趣，而他們表面上却是在說找尋做挑夫的男子哪。　　（三）　　正午，人和馬散在坡上，生起煮飯的野火，幾條藍烟的尾巴，裊裊地騰上樹梢。　　保商隊的弟兄，攻進坡下的旱地（倘如遇有旱地的時候）隨意俘獲掛着紅鬚的玉蜀黍，投在火中燒來「打尖」。　　女人趕忙毛下懐中的孩子，敞着胸前的奶頭，拐着長條的鐮刀足，四下裏亂跑，發瘋地喊着，像在找誰救命。老太婆捶着心口，急得呌天吟佛。　　纏着黑布套頭的隊長，麻煩不過她們的訴苦，便跳起來，揚着拳頭呼喝。　　「這算什麽？這算什麽？一點點包　…你們要土匪來搶才好！」　　女人終於嚇退，嚎哭地走開。　　（四）　　晚上，到息夜的地方，弟兄提着槍，朝人家戶裏亂鑽，粗暴地吩咐屋主，借舖陳，借蓆子，借稻草。　　主人卑怯可憐地回答着，說是有，就拿着走，說是沒有，便不客氣｜搜。　　燈光下晃着許多外鄕人的容顏，屋裏屋外洋溢着各種的氣息，人的兼馬的，和大說大笑的聲音。　　女人，小孩，老婆子，老頭子，躱在屋角落裏，悄悄地，交閃着憂鬱的眼光。　　次日，人馬又歡躍地前進着了，悲哀和苦痛却留在後面，長久地。　　强壯的漢子忍耐不下了，便向深山入夥去，或是單獨裝成割草的在路邊等候孤單的過客。　　於是，保商隊的需要便越發成爲不可少的了，而雲南東部的山，大約也就由此更見荒凉，更見蕭條了吧。韋爾斯的預言：一九三五年中日大戰記（續）  孟眞　　一九三六年，日本來華的軍隊，從滿洲以至廣東，其數無慮百五十萬，第一軍在平津，第二軍在山東，第三軍則上　於廣東。但是日本在中國的力量，始終不出其槍砲所及之範圍以外。日本曾一再施用毒瓦斯以爲攻擊。日本飛機所投下的，大抵是一種黃十字彈。最初是用以攻擊北平。後來曾兩次用以攻擊南京。此外，在攻擊武昌漢口時，也施用過。成千成萬的生命，以中毒而死，但是中國這個無脊椎動物般的巨體，却能漠然地忍受，而不覺得怎樣。　　此時，由中國人民堅忍不屈的抗日精神，出現了一種「復仇者」，忽然，中國也有飛機渡海以至日本，投毒瓦斯彈於東京大阪。大家都不知道中國的飛機從何處來。後來纔知道是由瑞典經過俄國來的。並且西方各國都曾賣戰時禁用品於中國。因此，在黃海上面，中國也有許多飛機飛到日本。一九三五年時，日本的運送船在勃海爲所擊沉。一九三六年，在港外五十哩的地面，日本輪船三艘突遭覆滅。中國的軍械，除北方從俄國購入外，南方則從法國及英國屬地買得。而因日本野心的擴大無所底止，於是美國親華排日的態度乃漸露骨。　　當中日開戰之初，世界輿論大體分爲二派。那些對日本的政策疑惑不安的，多同情中國，而與之對立，　對日本的軍事行動抱寬大的態度者，以爲這樣可免中國於赤化，在資本主義之下復興起來。但是因了日本軍隊的勝利，卒使歐美的感情漸漸離去日本，於是同情中國成爲世界的態度。　　澳洲與新西蘭，漸漸感到單賴英國的武力，不足以爲保障，乃在一九三七年，對美提出締結共同對日同盟之議。主張把太平洋上的歐美勢力都打成一氣，置於美國之下。這時，因了日本的飛躍發展，西方各國頗有聯合一致以對日的模樣，但是卒因中歐的政局，事不成功。　　當此之時，日本雖然著著勝利，但其國内的經濟狀態，實已岌岌不可終日。當初因爲迅速的佔領平津，華北戰事大獲勝利，所以國内的不滿，尙可有相當的鎭靜。使日本三島都漲起愛國的𤍠情。但是戰爭雖曾獲三度勝利的結果，却每次又隨卽發生。正如從沒有人能征服俄國到底一樣，也沒有人能永遠完全征服中國。所以中國各地，時常有反抗的行動。四川及南方各省，實對國民黨軍提供了無盡藏的資源。日本除非西進到了西藏，否則就不能完全平服中國。　　　　　　　（未完）兩兄弟（八）（七）  莫伯桑著李維克譯　　於是他混入這些業已開始的旅行的驚亂中忙忙碌碌的，慌慌張張的，尋找着自己的艙位，呼喊着，問詢着，隨意回應着的人們裏面，在船上徘佪着。他去向船長致敬並和他的同伴駐在船上的辦事委員握手之後，便走入已有幾個英國人在屋内假寐着的客廳裏面。這四壁盡是鑲着金邊的白色大理石的大廳裏，擺着許多長桌，桌的兩邊列着能够轉動的石榴色天鵝絨的坐椅，這一行行的桌和椅映入鏡子裏面，便成爲無邊無際的了。這正是那給五洲的富翁來聚餐的，飄浮在水上的，世界一家的大廳。它那種富麗的裝飾是和大旅館，劇塲，和其了公共地方的裝飾一樣的，一種使得富翁的眼睛感得滿足的顯赫的平凡的裝飾。醫生走近二等艙時，他記起昨天晚邊曾經有一羣移民上船了，他便降入中甲板。當他走進那裏面的時候，他突然聞到一種從貧苦不潔的人身上發出來的使他作嘔的氣味，一種比獸類的毛皮還要難聞的祼體的臭氣。於是在那和鑛裏面的坑道一般，一種黑而且低的隧道似的地方，筆爾瞧見無數男子，女人，和小孩，睡在一些層疊着的木板上，或是一堆堆的在地上騷動着。他分不淸他們的面貌，他祇模糊的看見這個披着襤褸的，汚穢的人羣，這個被生活壓服了的，筋疲力盡的，慘苦的人羣，他們帶着一個消瘦的女人，一些衰憊的孩子，去投奔一個陌生的地方，他們希望在那邊也許不至於餓死。　　想着他們過去的工作，那種白費氣力的工作，那種沒有收益的勞苦，那種日復一日的落空了的奮鬥，想着這羣以後又不知道要在什麽地方去開始這可怕的慘酷的生涯的赤貧者們所耗費的氣力，醫生眞想要對他們呌說：「我看你們還不如帶着你們的妻室兒女跳到水裏去找生路罷！」他是那樣的受着惻隠之情的打擊，他不能再看下去了，他連忙轉身走了。　　他的父親，母親，弟弟，和陸醉米太太，早已在他那小房間裏等候着他。　　「這樣早，」他說。　　「是啦，」羅蘭媽媽以一種顫慄着的聲音回答，「我們想來得早一點，可以多看看你。」　　他瞧着她。她是黑衣黑帽，彷佛像給什麽人戴着孝低的，並且他突然發見在上月還是斑白的她的頭髮，現在已完全白了。　　他費了許多力，才把那四個人安頓在他那狹小的住所裏，他自己坐在床上。從那開着的房門，我們可以見到好像一個節日在街上見到的擠擁的羣衆似的一大羣人源源走過，因爲乘客的一切友人和一班單是爲着好奇而來的觀衆全把這鉅大的郵船佔滿了。大家在走廊上，廳堂裏，到處走來走去，有的甚至把頭伸到房裏來探望，同時還有人在外面咕嘟着：「這是醫生的住處。」　　於是筆爾把門關了；可是等到他覺得和自己的家人一同關在屋裏時，他簡直想要把它再打開，因爲船上的騷動可以掩去他們的窘迫和沉默。　　陸醉米太太終於說話了：　　「由這種小商户裏是没有多少空氣進來的，」她說。</p>

罰錯誤人員，令其以後不要再錯。收發報人對於局台這樣的不客氣，一則可以使他們自己不吃虧，二則可以促進局台辦事的改善，那是最好沒有的了。　　（二）收發報人對於電報的傳遞或投送，發覺有延遲的情形，亦應該絲毫不客氣的向局台查詢。局台對於電報延遲的原因，當然要詳細調查，而給收發報人一個具體明白的答復。倘使延遲的原因，是出於經手人員的疏忽，那末主管人員一定要按照章程，把他們從嚴處罰，並且以後還要設法防備，以免第二次再有發生。收報人對於此種延遲情形，如果不向局台報吿查詢，那末主管人員無從一一知悉，結果對於收發人本身，及局台方面，是都不很好的。　　（三）各界人士如到電報局或無綫電台發寄電報，遇着收報人員應付無禮貌，或者辦理不滿意，儘可當面或冩信報吿主管人員，要求把收報人員懲罰。局臺雇用投送電報的報差，倘使不好好的送報，或者勒索小費等等，收報人亦可不顧情面的報吿主管人員，查明嚴辦。此種事情，假使沒有人舉發報台，往往是永久不會查出的。所以局臺很希望有人舉發報吿，可以照章秉公辦理。　　以上三種，是犖犖的幾點罷了。其他還有不少，不再多說，槪括的一句話，就是請收發報人，以後遇有不滿意局臺辦事的時候，可以隨時儘量地發揮他們不客氣的精神，嚴厲督責監視。這種的不客氣，是善意的，是可以促進局臺改善的，局臺對此，非但不敢絲毫怨恨，而且竭誠歡迎和感謝。半月消息  社友新訂記賬發電辦法各緊要城市之電報局及無綫電臺，爲便利各商行發電起見，向，有預存報費辦法。凡商行在局臺預存報費者，均可記賬發電，不必按電付費，以資簡便。惟各局台相沿辦理，並無劃一辦法，交通部茲爲統一辦法並便利商民起見，特訂定記賬發電辦法一種，通令各局台自本年三月一日起實行。茲將該辦法摘要錄後：　　（二）凡請求記賬發電，應先預存「報費保證金」於局台。　　（二）保證金由局台存入銀行，其利息每半年照銀行所給數目，提付商行。　　（三）記賬報費月終由局台開單向商行收取，逾三日不繳者，卽停止記賬發電，並將保證金扣抵報費。　　（四）報費保證金可以局臺指定銀行之担保信件代替。　　此項辦法，較舊時預存報費辦法不同之點，在：（一）保證金數目固定不動，記賬報費按月照付，不在保證金内扣付，以免每月續繳預存報費及滾存計算之煩。（二）保證金利息歸商行所得。（三）銀行担保信可以代替保證金。以上三點，均予商行以不少便利云。電政法令彙刋第二集出版交通部電政司編印之第二集電政法令彙刋，業已出版。所有交部最近公布實行之各種規章法令，及修正第一集之法令，均搜集甚爲完備。每册定價大洋肆角，如欲購閱者，可向交通部電政司接洽。又凡電政機關人員購閱者每册减價售大洋二角，以示優待云。日「滿」間電報制度（下）  葉仲華譯　　（二）最低價目　　日「滿」電報以三語爲最低價目，　不足三語，亦以三語計算。此則與國外和文電報相同，而與國内文異。　　國内和文電報之最低價目，有特别之規定，並不以語數爲基礎。　　（三）數字和文電報　　日「滿」電報亦收發數字和文電報（電文全係數字）此項數字和文電報，在收報人姓名住址欄内，得依照中國電報新編之數字傳遞。此爲便利「滿洲人」而特别承認者也。　　（四）電報價目　　日「滿」電報價目，旣規定爲語數制。所有關東州及附屬地曁「滿洲國」均統辦理。（其詳細價目從略）　　（五）其他處理方法　　除以上規定外，其餘悉照日本國内電報同樣辦理。　　結論　　根據上舉各節，吾人知關東州及附屬地與日本之電報制度，曁「滿洲國」與日本之電報制度，其價目之釐訂，及施行之辦法，均不一律；但今昔情形不同，非加改革，難期便利，（譯者按：關東州及附屬地，日人視爲領土，其視所謂「滿洲國」者，因尙有國際的關係，自前比較上稍異。）故此次乘滿洲電信電話株式會社成立之　會，藉得統一日「滿」間電報制度，誠極適宜｜此對於公衆使用上及局方管理上，均互有裨益云。（完）馬可尼軼事（一）  凡　　此次馬可尼來華，可說是深受我國朝野人士的𤍠烈歡迎。著者在上海十四學術團體開歡迎會的時候，幸得參加而瞻仰到這位大科學家的風儀。因此就拿他作爲本刋上的一個題目。但所要講的，並非當時歡迎會的情形，亦不是他發明無綫電的歷史，不過是從他的好友Luigi　Sor　ai專爲他冩的一本書中，所講的幾椿軼事和他日常的行動，爰爲譯出，以供吾電界同人茶餘飯後的談話資料而已。　　這書先用一句極妙的言喻，表示馬可尼一生經過的情形。「如吾人取縱橫兩條直綫，假定橫綫上代表時間，縱綫之上部代表快樂，下部代表憂慮，而畫出一條曲綫，代表馬可尼一生經過的情形，則見其狀態，和他不停研究的電磁波，是一樣的。但他的意志，無論快樂或憂愁，終是不變。快樂的時候，並不自驕。憂愁的時候，亦不失望。他在早晨預備工作的時候，是少開口。到晚上忘記了工作的煩惱，却又顯出和藹與快樂的面貌。這就是馬可尼一生的態度」　　這書的首貢，是一張馬可尼的小照。他說：「馬可尼是軀幹魁梧，面長而寬。額頗高。眼深而不大，愉快時頗活躍，决斷時則凝定。唇直而作靜默狀。發言時，聲緩而低。說英語甚流利，人其說祖國語無異。稍能說法語，但常帶英國口音。他不喜演講或著作，偶爲之，則簡括而凖確。遇見不熟悉的人，不肯多講話。在宴會時候，他的面貌，終是很莊嚴而像帶着憂慮的狀態。但對於知己朋友，却又很和善而親暱的。如和宴會的時候比較，彷彿判若兩人。他行路頗慢，因爲他最恨的，是做事侷促的人。與人約會，必凖時而到，從未遲到或早退。」　　「我祇見馬可尼發過一次脾氣，這是在Carlo　Alberto軍艦上所發生的事情。有一天晚上，我和馬可尼同在接收從倫敦使館發給意皇第一個官電的時候。我們先收到一聯S.S.(…)的信號。但Poldu電臺的報務員，大約對於電碼，不甚熟悉，終是弄錯。弄錯了，卽連續不停的發點。馬可尼不耐煩的呌道：『這是那一個笨人？』後來在回答的時候，我們自己亦弄錯了好幾次。因爲當時的無綫電機器，很難調凖。尤其我們所用的收報凝屑器，非數分鐘弄不好。到了第三次的錯，馬可尼大不耐煩，就拿檯上洋燭抛去。不小心竟把發報機的來頓瓶打破。後來Spezia製造局，要我賠償這來頓瓶，因爲我是負軍艦上無綫電臺責任的。我所遇到馬可尼發脾氣，祇在這一次。但平常他無論遇到什麽困難和不如意的事情，終是很鎭靜很能自主的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言大學生失眠年  易　　有一位大學四年級的學生對我說：「人家講什麽「婦女國貨年」，「兒童年」，「電影年」，可是我說我們大學生在四年級讀書這一年是失眠年」。他不待我問明就接着說道，「先生你看，快要畢業了，畢業以後呢？出洋留學沒有資本。到社會上去服務吧，｜還是說去找飯碗好，｜失業的人多得很，那裏容易找到一碗飯吃？所以不要提起畢業還可以糊裏糊塗地上課下課，一提起要畢業，這畢業以後的生活問題就使你天天失眠」！　　這一位大學生自然是一個窮苦好學頭腦淸楚，思想高超的靑年，才有這麽一種憂慮，假如以學校作旅館，讀書的目的只在一張文憑｜或者甚至連一張文憑都無所謂不要緊的有錢子弟，那他對於「畢業以後呢」？這問題容易答覆得很，「畢業以後出洋留學」。然而，每一個大學的畢業生，能够有幾個出洋留學？脫離學校就要謀生活的那是佔了最大多數。想及畢業以後到社會謀生活的困難，因而「天天失眠」，這就是證明了大學畢業生的沒有出路，同時也就證明了大學敎育的破產。這對於「大學無用論」者的確是一個有力的證據。然而「大學無用論」者已經被人　　杞人憂天，　一些在過着「失　年」的大學生也似乎是「低能兒」　和並非「民族英雄」的可　之材了。古人有言「學優登仕」，　是說畢業以　　　　　　　　國民政府舉行高等考試，金榜題名那第一個的便立刻做了簡任官，這是政府對於大學畢業生打開的出路，不管宦海如何黑暗，「災官」時在製造，可是一舉成名天下知，簡任官上任光祖耀宗，現實享福，將來陞了官，而且聯帶發了財，豈不妙哉？這是「大學之道」的大道路，開闢着在等着大學生賽跑上去的。如果做了官，其任務便是在發揚發財之道，從小官兒陞至大官爺，富貴雙全。卽是說；大學之道，在發發財，在陞官，在至於至上。其次就是「投筆從戎」，卽是說畢業以後就去投軍。如今大學生不是在上「軍事訓練」嗎？「舉槍，敬禮」，那一套對於長官奉承的人生戰術之外，「臥倒，描凖，｜放」，那一套開槍打仗殺死他人的必要戰術，一旦風雲際會，運氣旺盛的時候，再有帝國主義武力强佔我們中國的什麽省分的時候，｜我可以擔保，你去陞官發財，卽使時運不齊，「縮退防綫」，那時民衆捐欵已入荷包，所謂名利雙收者也，豈不美哉？倘或不幸國内起閧，又可隨機應變，應付有方，立刻旅長陞師長，師長陞軍長，而且名揚四海富甲三軍，也是所謂名利雙收者也，豈不樂哉？此外還有……出路孔多，不勝臚述。　　然而，話又得說回來，大學生的靑年們，如今頭腦淸楚，思想高超的多，决不至於朝向以上所述的歧路跑去，因此，他們在第四年級讀書將要畢業的時候，也就難免天天失眠，一年的讀書時期成爲「失眠年」了，嗚呼！難爲煞財神爺  木郎　　「先生，請你替我查一個奬劵號碼」，一個年輕漂亮的婦女，帶着希冀的笑容問銅欄杆裏面的銀行職員，說話的聲音微微帶些顫抖；一面從内衣袋裏摸出一張小字條，愼重地念道：「二二○八六四，先生，你們有這個號碼嗎？」　　「請你等一等。」銀行職員回答，一面從抽屜裏拿出一本簿子來查看。在經過一番審查後，淡淡地說道：　　「這個號碼是有的，却已在昨天賣去了，」末了加一句，「如果你早一天來，也許可以買得到。」　　「眞的嗎？」年輕婦女露着驚詫的神色說，但在那微透出興奮的紅色的臉上，一絲不滅的希望還在閃動，顯然她還有一般自信的勇氣，於是那勇氣鼓勵她說出：　　「那末總還有一兩條剩着沒有賣去罷。我祗要一條够了。」　　「這號碼是全張賣出的。」　　「不能追回一兩條來嗎？先生。」絶望支配了她的全身，顯然，這句話是她勉强地對絶望的掙扎。　　「那怎麽可以呢？」銀行職員劃了一根火柴，點燃了一支紙烟，淡淡地把這句反問語帶烟吐出。半響，他似乎正經地問她道｜「但是你爲什麽指定要買這個號碼呢？」　　兩對眼睛觸視着，一對有些俏皮，一對帶着羞澀。　　「無非是做着一個夢罷了。」婦人含着　　的笑容說。「現在旣然你們已經把　賣去了，也不必多說。不過我那個夢確實記得非常淸楚，我從來沒有做過這種靈淸的夢，我明明看見一張二二○八六四的彩票放在我面前，動也不動……　唉，財神菩薩旣然要我發財，爲什麽不把這個夢　　晚托給我呢？這不是有心給我吃　　　心湯　嗎？」　　婦人帶　　　的餘怒走出了銀行的大門，忘了向銀行職員道一聲謝，或者說一句「明天見」。　　這時銅欄杆裏面的一羣年輕小夥子呈出了活氣，大家目送着那婦人出去，回過頭來，各交換了一個會心的微笑。　　「老　，剛纔你爲什麽不問她一個地址呢？那張票子昨天不是賣給××的嗎？我　向他們去說說情，也許可以要回一兩條來。可是現在來不及了。」亢爽好事的小陸這樣說，言下大有顧惜的心情。　　「誰要你這樣𤍠心呢？」　　小陸一時回答不出，於是大家哄然地笑了。　　「老張，剛纔的號碼你還記得嗎？」另一個姓王的說，同時從衣袋裏摸出一本日記簿。「你趕快說出來，讓我加一筆進去。」　　「二二○八六四。」老張說。　　「二二○八六四，」那個人一面冩，一面念，又把筆桿點着日記簿上已經冩着的號碼，一五一十地數道，「好，連這個號碼一共是三十七個了，沒有一個相同的。據他們來買的人自己說，這許多號碼都是從做夢得來的，而且夢做得非常淸晰。但是航空奬劵不能有三十七個頭奬呀。」　　「阿王，在這三十七個號碼中，買到的有幾個？買不到的又有幾個？」小陸問。　　「十二個人抱着希望回去，其餘都是失望的。」　　這時一個年邁的穿着短衣的老翁從門口一拐一拐地走進到櫃台前，誠懇地向他們這一堆在說笑的人問道，「先生，煩勞你結我查一個彩票號頭，一七六三八○。」　　老翁的沙啞的語調打斷了他們談笑的興趣，於是各人埋頭去做自己的職務了。老張無力地翻了一翻簿子，都意外地發見這號碼是有的，而且並沒有賣出。　　那老翁顫抖地摸出一塊錢，換了一個希望抱回去。老張沒有問他這個號碼是否從做夢得來，祗淡淡地向阿王道：　　「阿王，在你的日記簿上再添一筆罷，一七六三八○。」剪刀形的中國經濟  瓊聲　　在經濟學上，對於目前社會的經濟發展有因特殊的考語，卽「剪刀形」。所謂「剪刀形」卽社會財富所寄的資本有奇形的偏趨，一切的生產側重於工業發展，造成都市的繁榮，鄕村財源的枯竭，使之陷於長久的貧困。城市與鄕村，一大一小，一興一衰，成爲現社會經濟頭重脚輕的病態現象。　　中國自古是「以農立國」，雖然現在都市是那樣發達，農村又是如此的破產，經濟發展早成了「剪刀」；可是中國是有「特殊國情」的，因此各國經濟發展的鐡律，反映到中國也就異樣。據日前報載，在「百業凋敝」之際，各銀行去年營業均有極大盈餘，中央銀行且達一千數百萬元之鉅，一般希望，我國民族經濟發達質樸的讀者，或者以爲全世界均感受經濟危機，交易所破產，銀行倒閉的目前，我國銀行竟自獨樹一幟，生意興隆，要爲我國民族資本前途的發展慶幸罷，但我讀了，則覺「哭笑不得」而「啼笑皆非」！　　經濟發展的常例，是先由工業生產的繁盛而引起財政的集中和銀行資本的發達，而去年於「百業凋敝」之際，銀行營業獨能興盛，這並非象徵我國民族資本的上進，而是意識着他的「每况愈下」。去年雖以「國貨年」來號召，以圖中國工業的興盛，但帝國主義於經濟危機脅迫極度疲憊之餘，視中國爲商品消售的尾　，盡量的在中國實行其「探併」的大傾消，反使中國工業蒙受極大的打擊，最大產業如紡紗繅絲業等停歇者均十之八九。中國民族工業在此「凋敝」之際，過剩資本就轉移到各種不生產的投機事業上來，這旣是去年銀行營業獨特繁榮的主要原因。同時内地因内憂外患天災人禍的極度增長，更將農村所有的息息現金往都市趕，而進了銀行裏的貯蓄庫。　　因此，所謂表徵經濟發展城市鄕村不平衡的「剪刀形」，在中國更加上工業衰敗與不生產資本投機事業的銀行營業的興盛不平衡的「剪刀形」。銀行營業在去年之不著重工業投資，而盡趨於都市的地皮建築保險信托的投機，已成爲中國民族工業沒落，國外商品激增，日益殖民地化的特徵。銀行資本與工業投資成了我國經濟的「剪刀形」！　　可是近來又倡導着「婦女國貨年」了，這一般興奮劑之是否能將「剪刀形」的中國經濟，起死回生，正如「婦女國貨年」之只能助少數豪奢婦女愈趨外貨的「剪刀形」，一樣同其命運。中國民族工業恐非甚麽「婦女國貨年」，「兒童年」所能援救，而應從中國經濟「剪刀　」發展的消滅上着手，不過是又同消滅中國國際關係上的「剪刀形」，消滅我們在政治上的投機性，而確實來一番政治獨立，工業振興的工作的問題，有着密切的聯繫了。婦女國貨年  乎　　在這年頭，人們似科已經把這一年要做的事情安排好了，最惹人注目的；有婦女國貨年，兒童年，勦匪第二年……這樣把這一年要做的事情在年頭排演出來，也可表現一點中國人做事的精神吧，至少也可以洗刷中國人「無組織」，「無計劃」，「五分鐘𤍠心」那些可恥可辱的譏誚了吧！　　話雖這樣說，然而人事萬端，稍一懶散，便有百年不堪回首之嘆，如果讓我們檢察，讓我們暢快的指　，那就請看這一句掃興頭的話：「有閒的人喜翻花樣，但僅僅是翻花樣而已。」　　去年是人人相稱爲「國貨年」的一個年頭，報紙宣揚，名人鼓勵，但海關的統計，却毫無情面的吿訴了我們，「國貨年」中的入超達九萬萬元之鉅，比前年（應該說是非國貨年吧！）的入超數更大；入超數這麽大，那就外國貨也更來的多，這無須再說明。還有一個事實：「國貨年」中的本國絲廠，紗廠，麵廠，粉廠，大都仰給於外國的絲紗麵粉，内地的絲紗無人過問，内地的米穀，堆成廢墟，有的地方，絲紗商人停歇，有的地方，把過剩的米穀推在野外，揮着眼淚，用火燒毁，凡這些傷心慘目的事實，是我們在這所謂「國貨年」中所看到聽到的，這些事實，又都是人所共知，人所共曉的。　　提倡了一年的國貨上海的商家們也都掛着國貨的招牌，然而，實際的市塲上却充塞了洋貨，洋人們挺着大肚皮揚眉吐氣地回到祖國過年去了，剩下了中國土著商人們冷冷淸淸，愁眉嘆息，而這掛牌的國貨年便在這冷冷淸淸，愁眉嘆息之中過去了，回顧這年能無感痛！　　於今又來一個婦女國貨年，要人夫人，名閣小姐，都相率參加盛典，坐着汽車沿街遊行，这個新花樣，點綴在新年的頭一天，可又不知耗費了那些𤍠心提倡者多少心血。然而在這盛典中，我覺得他們提倡國貨，並不十分誠篤，他們要坐時髦的汽車，他們的脚上還是穿一雙高跟皮鞋，他們不喜歡坐黃包車，不喜歡穿中國式的鞋子。這就表現了一個很大的破綻，他們提倡國貨，未必是爲了提倡國貨，而提倡國貨未必是由那心靈的底里發出了什麽愛國的𤍠情，但是他們太安閒了，閒着無事可做，就另出心裁，翻新花樣！　　這不是誣蔑的話，要高貴的摩登奶奶姑娘們不用外國貨，那是一個「新年的夢想」，提倡國貨不從生產大衆裏面去提倡國貨的改造改革運動，却在這些專門耗費洋貨的高貴的婦女們身上來提倡，那是舍本逐末，再愚蠢不過的辦法，！如果有人以爲這話太過火了，那末，擺在上海的各大公司及各種大小洋貨店裏的那些洋貨，沒有中國女子去光顧，再退一萬步說，今日正在𤍠烈高呌着「婦女國貨年」的婦女們，他們在這一年中絶迹不到洋貨店，不穿洋衣，不戴洋帽，不着洋鞋洋靴，那才算得是提倡「婦女國貨年」赢得的功績，收到的效果，也纔能證實上面所說話，是太過火了　　别的不再說了，我們算定婦女國貨年又會和去年的國貨年一樣無聲無息的逝去，有心救國的人不要把希望寄託在那空虛的事件上，也不要把自己過活在空虛的生活中，應該把握那實際的工作，比如提倡國貨，應該深入廣大的羣衆裏面結合那些村夫村婦製造國貨，改良國貨，提高勞動的生產力，消耗力，這樣實際地堅實地動作起來，國貨運動終能普遍，纔能持久，好吧，現在掛上了一個婦女國貨年的招牌，我們大家的心裏就暗地裏藏眘一個國貨救婦女年，在這個年上多多着力吧！</p>

<p>業餘信箱好事多磨編者先生：　　我們有一難題，懇求先生代爲解釋。懷懃年二十二歲，父已早故，有一兄長。懷懃現在金業服務多年。幼年和鄰居，蕭侶雲結友，今年二十一歲，其父已去世。家道小康，母愛女如寳，近數年我倆友誼增深，已暗訂爲終身伴侶。侶雲的母親，我倆是徵求着美滿的同意，懷懃的母親平常對於侶雲也非常敬愛。這樣我們的結合本來是不會發生問題的，但後來有人破壞，在我們二位母親面前，搬弄是非，使得二老大起一塲風波。唉！意想不到，數十年之鄰居，而且將要成爲親家，竟立刻成爲仇家，破壞我們的歹人眞是可恨之至。但侶雲的母親後來覺悟，知歹人在内作惡，二方都是發生誤會，並且希望我們能够成功，而懷懃的母親，却皮氣固執，毫無悔意，反而聽歹人之言，在舊年十月裏，另和某姓之女說合，先行授紅，（舊式風俗卽預訂婚禮）至今春逼懷懃返里訂婚，那時用强制手段壓迫，懷懃竟無法反抗。我倆密立志願寗可犠牲一切，决不分離，但我倆智識淺薄，程度很低，如何能奮鬥到底，獲得最後勝利呢！再會我倆祝先生前途光明　　困難人周懷懃蕭侶雲同鞠躬　　編者按：周蕭二位戀愛，能如此堅决，着實够我們欽佩。我們接到來信之後，曾考慮很久；如何可以爲二位謀得團圓的結果，同時並不使二位的家長不歡，演成家庭間的悲劇。因爲假如單使二位能够達到結合的目的，問題是很簡單的，因爲婚姻本來就應當由雙方的意思自己决定，家長參加意見是可以的，而且應當的，但决定却完全也要由雙方自主，况且二位又都是成年人，更毫無問題。我們所最擔心的，就是當此家庭組織在大變動的時代，父母還是本着傳統的思想，對於子女的婚姻，仍舊是獨斷獨行，如今若突然由子女自己决定自己的婚事，並且他們所不贊成的婚事，在他們看來，豈非是大大的忤逆不孝。所以我們再三考慮的結果，認爲你們的結合最好是不要過於違拂你們的慈親，但是萬一目的不能達到，却仍須一本初衷，仍應抱着「寗可犠牲一切，决不分離，」的態度，儘可自動結婚。至於進行的辦法我們認爲是：第一，懷懃可向其母解釋雙方以前的誤會，並堅决表明你要娶蕭女士的意思。（這事最好央人說項，以避免直接衝突。）這樣，老人愛子情深，或許肯犠牲成見也說不定。如果這個辦法做不到，那我們以爲二位就自己宣吿結婚，懷懃再將他以前的婚約解除，不必再說别的。不過是最不得已辦法，能够避免是最好。以前懷懃君鑄了一個大錯，就是你現在已經同他人訂婚了，因爲這樣你的母親將更不許你與侶雲女士結合（因爲她說的婚事現在要退是决不願意的）而且退婚在舊社會上是一樁十分困難的事。懷懃君在理應當於今春訂婚時就嚴重反對，到現在已是有點遲了。而且由此看出你們仍難免被環境所屈服，况且現在的環境較從前更壞，克服更加困難。所以我們希望你們在未奮鬥以前，自己先量估一下；自己是否確有决心，如果是有，那纔去奮鬥，否則勝利不但不會獲得，反而使母子間終身留着一個深刻的裂痕，這又何苦來呢。　　總之，事在人爲，你開始央求令堂時態度務必從容，誠懇，决不可操之過切，後來反無轉園的餘地，好在你意志旣如此堅决，本來就沒有什麽畏懼，因爲你本來是沒有失敗或不達到目的可言的，你之所以要得到母親同意者，無非是不要演成倫常間的慘劇而已。至於結合的權限那是完全在你們自己的手裏，並不是在你們母親手裏｜這一點你得明白｜，我們的答覆或許你以爲太空洞，但我們對於你的情形所曉得的祗像來信所說的那麽簡單，我們還能提出什麽更具體的辦法呢？自我職業介紹　　曼夫君，大學經濟學系修業三年，茲願任高小學或高初中學國文與社會科學敎員，薪金半盡義務，通訊處本埠眞如曁南大學楊子雲先生收轉。　　霞女士，浙江籍，年二十歲，肄業於某大學，現願於寒假期内任家庭敎師或其他高尙職業，惟授敎者以小孩爲限，地點以南市附近爲佳，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。　　孫敏女士，年二十五歲，江蘇人，大學畢業，歷任京滬揚中小學敎員及黨政機關職員，擅長文學史地及體育，願找一相當工作，通信處請由本報業餘周刋轉。　　孫誠君，年二十六，江蘇人，曾任上海某體育專科學校畢業，歷任中小學敎員多年，擅長國文體育，願找一相當工作，通信處請由本報業餘周刋轉。　　張珍女士，年十八，江蘇人，初中程度，現因家境困難，不能繼續讀書，擬找一相當工作，待遇不計多寡，工作不問勞逸，通信處請由本報業餘周刋轉。　　胡萍女士，年二十四，省立女子中學高中師範科畢業，浙江嘉興人，歷任松杭小學敎員多年，現願找一相當工作，通訊處請由本報業餘週刋轉。　　沈毅君，江陰人，年二十三歲，擅長藝術廣吿畫，現擬受任廣吿員之職，本外埠均可，薪金不計，欲聘者請投函福煦路三百十二號好萊塢花紙行張晋殿君轉。　　新之君，年二十歲，高小畢業，精英文，能操流利英語，備有舖保，願就勤務等職，須供膳宿，薪水不計，通訊處滬西白利南路仁樂坊二十三號轉。　　諸葛華女士，現年二十五，師範科畢業，曾在松江任敎　數年，今欲謀一家庭學校敎員，商店賬席，或華文打字等職，有意者請致函本埠中山路大厦大學羣英齊諸葛英女士轉交。　　W女士，浙江人，師範卒業，曾執敎於中小學多年，敎授經騐宏富，尤精歌舞，體育，及課餘指導等項，本埠公司，洋行，公館及學校等，如須用此項人材者，請投函本埠愛多亞路八十號内華商紗布交易所邵誠君收轉。　　王世宏君，貴陽人，年二十三歲，中央憲兵學校卒業，曾任中央憲兵第三團班長，僱爲保鑣，頗爲相宜，並有殷實保證，薪金不計，其他職業亦均願就，通訊處上海郵政管理局三樓國際匯票處余衆孚君轉。　　王企白君，浙江籍，年二十二歲，中學程度，曾充公司工廠等職員，熟悉管理貨棧，工廠人事，及電話接線等職務，如有各機關公司工廠等需用者，薪水不計，並有妥保，通訊處閘北新疆路南林里一六八號轉。　　秉光君，徽籍，年二十八歲，高中畢業，現願任僮僕等任何工作，或出遠門均可，薪工不計，具有相當保證，通訊處法租界望志路永吉里四號半劉光寰轉。　　烈君，年二十五歲，能操滬粵及國語，長於中等國文史地敎育學科，願任敎員，書記以及庶務店員等職，通信本報業餘周刋轉。　　某女士，年二十歲，上海籍，高中程度，現在海上著名夜商學校肄業，曾任某公館敎席有年，現願就公館敎席或銀行洋行職員等職，通信處本埠海寗路南高壽里五三號沈君轉交。　　徵女士，粵籍，年二十三歲，卒業高中，曾任學校私人敎授曁書記英文打字等職，今願任學校或家庭兒童敎師或洋行機關職員等職，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。　　安女士，江蘇籍，師範畢業，曾任家庭敎師及小學級任兼美術敎員等職，今願任上述各職，通訊處甘世東路一百八十五弄十一號。　　秀女士，浙籍，師範畢業，曾任家庭敎師及小學敎師多年，今願任本外埠小學及家庭敎師等職，通訊處上海甘世路一百八十五弄十一號小說獄中記（十）  車輪　　我推進二科的門，所有的看守長，科員都在他們大都靜默着，在等待一件將發生的事，將去解决的事，因爲這裏是平靜無事的地方，犯人都像棉條像小羊，他們空間得抽烟都抽怕了；在這種一動就是吃虧的所在誰的頭會硬呀。因此在某件小事一發生所有獄中的公作人員都集中了注意力｜｜這時他們就是在等候將被他們壓下去而出醜或者吃苦的犠牲品，我去。所以我一進去眼睛都到了我身上。　　二科長像從我感受了吸力似的立了起來，起先是用近視的眼鏡靠近了我張報吿在看，在細細研究如何從其中汲取反擊的話，大槪總不止看了三四遍了。　　在每張辦公桌上都有一盞電燈，整個的一盞電燈｜這現象在我很奇怪，三年的習慣把我腦袋中整盞電燈的好印象都模糊了，好像世界上祇有半盞半盞的暗弱像油燈般亮的電燈了｜｜現在於我眼前大放光明的是十九盞在一起的電燈，整個辦公室像在燈，在我幾乎是個奇蹟。　　　我住了三年來的號子（雖然掉過幾個，但都差不多。）在牆壁頂上挖了個小洞把十幾支光的電燈裝在這中間，和隔壁的那號子合享這一些光明。　　「你什麽病？」｜他的臉雖嚴肅，却在這樣亮的電光下似乎很柔和。　　「不知是什麽病，醫官沒對我講過；我的脚指上已經腫了三四個月了，唯其醫官未曾指明這是什麽所以我更恐怖。」　　「你打了個報吿要求發酒下來，是不是？」他的話是抑制着忿怒說的。　　「是，是，因我打了十多針麻木病針未好，藥末吃了幾十包也無效；醫官說這種酒我可以吃好的。所以請家裏買了一瓶來。」　　我的話是洶湧而出，因我也抑不止的忿怒和鬱屈着。　　他，我看得出是忍了再忍了，緩緩地坐了下去，拿我的報吿拿到桌邊，用手指指着報吿說｜「你看｜你說醫務所看不好你的病，那末我們是拿醫務所作幌子的呀？諞人的呀？你說，你說！」　　「不，不，…」在我的不字剛剛出口，他又接續講下去，並且跟着喉嚨的高起而立了起來說｜「不，你不是明明講醫務所無用？」　　這時我絶無講話的餘地，他的話與動作做得很緊張，沒有留一分鐘我申辯，他在我的臉上打了二個耳光。</p>

<p>電影專刊一封澳洲的通訊英國片和美國片的宣戰（下）  引西　　「此處對於美國方面的電影明星，最崇拜的可以說就是喬治亞理斯（GeougeArliss)。他的作品，就是糟的，亦可以在此地放映多少日子。原因亦許是因爲他是英國人，或者他的名字喬治，特别爲英國人尊崇的緣故。年紀輕些的明星，克拉克蓋博（Clark　Goble）還有相當的地位，但是我可以說，在澳洲地方，無論什麽明星，都沒有什麽極大的號召。觀衆們看的是戲，並不崇拜明星。許多戲迷，連各演員的姓名都記不淸的。很奇怪的，這裏對於散蘇畢茨（Zasu　Pitts）,倒極其推崇。那亦不能怪他們，因爲散蘇本來就是銀幕上很大的藝術家。她最吃虧的地方，就是她以前所扮的粗俗滑𥡴的角色太多了，不過她不久一定會得到適當她身份的角色的。　　「我因爲和雷門諾伐羅（Ramon　Novarro）是多年老友的原因，我爲他的前程而担憂。我在中國，日本，菲律濱，爪哇一帶，我常常拿雷門做問題，但是我從來沒有得到過好的答復。他們都不歡迎他，都說他太閨閣派了。這是很錯誤的，或者是因爲他扮演的片子，來到東方的，使他們覺得如此。很可怪的，特别是足球影片，雷門本來也不是足球片的材料也。（譯者於此，稍覺喀爾君所說的不盡然。我知道許多中國人是歡迎雷門諾伐羅的，特别是太太小姐們，許就因爲他近乎閨閣派的緣故。）　　「現在澳洲人，亦在開始自己拍影片了。這裏已經有兩家影片公司開始工作。但是他們境遇很困難，當局不能顧全大局，嚴酷的檢查使他們受到無窮的痛苦。是近他們想拍一張冒險片子，像我們用紅人拍的片子一樣，不遇他們用黑人來代替了紅人。這張片子拍了一半，就被政府禁止了，說那片子的内容，和當地事實不符。那家公司就些破產關門，股東的資本，也全部喪失了。　　「有一件事是很値得記載的。從前在落杉磯和别的大地方，曾經試騐過專映新聞片的戲院，但是都失敗了。可是在雪泥埠，倒有一家專映新聞片的戲院，營業並且很好。那般觀衆非常歡喜看新聞片，時常看著幾個月前的老新聞，亦覺得有趣。　　「今天有兩個有希望的靑年，一男一女，坐船到好菜塢去了。派拉蒙公司在此地發起了一個美貌競賽會，他們就是那會當選的冠軍。女的是此地一個名門的閨秀，年齡不過十九歲。她能說七國的方言，並且會騎馬游泳等等。派拉蒙在此駐紮的人員，以爲這是不可多得的人才，但是她到了好萊塢就明白了，她揮淚悲哭的時候，祇用得著一種方言就够了。那男的是位靑年律師。我不知道他是怎樣美麗，但他的名字「白利安諾曼」，倒是很動人的。（完）影片談評「銀窟情魔」評  王菲“Silver　Dollar”　　是的，我並不想單獨的指出「銀窟情魔」的技術，是「値得我們給以很高的評價」。因爲我始終相信形式是内容决定，對於旣成藝術，是應該批判的接受。所以在這裏我鄭重的聲稱，「銀窟情魔」的形式和它的内容，同樣的不良，雖則西洋電影的五花八門的形式，已經壓倒了很多「批評家」的現在。　　高速度是新世紀的特徵，但新的電影藝術，首先就要滿足明確性的條件。「銀窟情魔」的開展，速度是相當的高的，但因爲明確性的缺乏，而不能不使「銀窟情魔」就是在形式上也同樣的表示不出一點新的傾向。而這個「不明確」，我們不能舍本求末的只指出導演處理不善，我們得理解這内容｜｜故事的本身是這樣的。　　新藝術的　造（特别是電影）尤其要注意它的「單純性」，所謂「單純性」，左作家的　作方法上，處理主題，是從複雜的紛亂之中，找出他的「單純」來。現表方面，是緊握着那個主題，這樣作家，表現的纔是現實，而不是現象，觀衆了解的，纔是本質，而不是浮影。「銀窟情魔」的失敗，主要的就是不「單純」。　　「銀窟情魔」，是表出一八六零年銀本位廢止時的一個悲劇，一個因爲銀本位的確定而興起，因爲銀本位廢止而破產的人的經過。這雖是歷史上的事件，但是在目前，再提出，並不是偶然的。永恒的經濟危機，是更加深入了，在歐美幾多採取金本位的國家，放棄了金本位了，黃金的美國，她是有着强逼各國（特别是法國）放棄金本位的企圖，而其本國，放棄金本位的呼聲，也不斷的興起。在這一個場合，他們自然考慮着廢棄金本位後的幣制。首先想到的，自然是銀本位。於是銀本位廢棄時的事件，就再提出來，所以，這張「銀窟情魔」的製作，受着金本位動搖的刺激，是一定的。　　這個題材，並不能說不好。但是就因爲製作者　作方法的缺少「單純性」，而這個重要的主意，反而爲不相干的東西弄得模糊起來。更因爲製作者本身的感情關係，使這張「銀窟情魔」的給觀衆了解成爲全不是那回事。好象富翁的破產，我們看到的與其說是爲了銀本位的廢止，不如說因爲他荒淫，而給他一個責罰。更何况製作者對於富翁的沒落還感到輕微的悲哀，這是下意識的矛盾。　　所以，「窮人辛辛苦苦的掙到了錢，是應該安分的守着，纔是正理」。「銀窟情魔」這樣的說敎，是超過應該强調的銀本位的廢止的。何况他還表現出窮人們是注定了窮的。　　同時，在結尾上，他更加上了變愛至上的尾巴，富翁破產以後，一切都完了，而辛苦弄到手的少女，却依舊和他共困苦。　　在技術方面，我覺得有一點値得我們嚴重注意的，就是回憶叙述的應用。我們大家知道，開始沒落的人們，是追思着已經的盛况。所以回憶的叙述方法，是爲描冩悲劇的作家所採用，「伏虎美人」就是一個好例。「銀窟情魔」，也是這樣，其它「天長地久」等，也有極多回憶的。「回憶是詩的」我們當然不止在他的增多情感上解釋而己，我們更得知道舊藝術家是和他的一羣同樣的眷眷於過去，而不時的回憶着。　　最後，我得說明主角愛得華羅　生的多才多藝，他表演一個人在不同的環境之下的不同的神情，是恰到好處。這種内心與劇情吻合的才能，是不可多得的。「火柴大王」評  摩爾　　資本主義的巨靈之掌，早已絶對支配着歐美的政治，而華盛頓的人物，也就是華爾街的代理人。這是最明顯的。火柴大王因爲火柴托辣斯而名聞世界，但終於失敗而自殺了。他是給更大的資本家，更大的托辣斯「迫死」的。　　資本主義社會，是色情的社會。資產階級是色情的階級。優越的經濟勢力，可以收買少女的肉體以及她的靈魂。所以關於火柴大王的玩弄女人的本領也和他的火柴同樣名聞世界。好萊塢的「名星」嘉賓，就有關於她和火柴大王瞹昧的傳說。我們看「火柴大王」的時候多少總會想得到這一件事的。　　「火柴大王」影片，是叙述他的一生的影片，正和羅斯福奮鬥史一樣。但是製作者的創作態度就完全兩樣。他儘量的描冩他的淫蕩與殘酷，玩弄女人和沉人入海。難道破產自殺了的「火柴大王」還能做黃金的美利堅的「產業大王」們的勁敵嗎？　　是的，「火柴大王」是比較沉悶的，但這沉悶是故事决定的。導演是儘量的使他輕鬆。好像最後自殺的時候，許多過去的事情和人物，一個個向腦中走過，他已盡了歸納之能事，而叙述次序詳略，也費了很大的氣力。　　這裏，我們就得考察傳記影片拍攝的不容易討好了。大槪一個人，已經引起了廣大的羣衆的注意，一方面，他的死法，又非常奇特，那末，他的傳記影片的能够號召一部份人，是一定的。不過，我們應該採取他平生最精采的事件，而加以描冩。不重要的，可以略去。像唐吉訶德，小說是非常長的，而銀幕上只採取他最重要的地方。結果，得到了好結果。這雖則不是傳記影片，但却證明了我的話。「火柴大王」的失敗就在這裏，本來事情太多，膠片上放不下去的。　　最後，我們還得提一提，就是女主角，非常像嘉賓。雖則戲不多，但是，製作者的有意影射，是很可疑的。信不信由你  邨農　　「女人」導演史東山·梵華林拉得極好，據云，自備的一隻梵華林，係向古董店裏購來，乃一千八百餘年間的貨色，他每日並無間斷，計拉七年，眞可謂電影界中的有心人。　　大導演卜萬蒼之所以身體發胖，有一原因，蓋其幾年來，每天必飲白蘭地一大盃。　　袁美雲見人必笑。　　胡萍自一九三三年起，所有服裝，均仿美國好萊塢女星的式樣。　　攝影師周克，平日頗儉樸，因而同事們都呌他做「猶太富翁」。　　「飛花村」導演鄭應時，球迷極深。　　查瑞龍習過銅匠，鐡匠，木匠，打樣師，電燈匠，並會游泳，駕汽車，機器脚踏車，及騎馬等。　　但杜宇喜說笑語，因有一雅號，曰，「大痰盂」。　　佈影師方沛霖，暇時卽學習羅崙士鐡拔脫的歌唱，極神似。拍戲趣聞眉毛不翼而飛佈景板　　這一則有趣味的消息，我覺得不可不報吿給讀者們！　　藝華公司胡銳導演的「列焰」，因爲它的劇情，是以火爲背景的，拍戲時候，就把幾位重要的演員，燒得眞會汗毛站班！　　前天「列焰」在閘北拍火燒，有四輛救火車，和幾十個救火員在參加拍戲。俗語說：「星星之火，可以燎源」｜而他們却在屋房的四週，大澆其汽油，所以，一着火便是來勢洶湧，當時許多救火員，都認眞的相救，不料那天恰巧西北風極大，火屑飛舞，有些像臘月下雪一樣。　　大槪是祝融氏在開玩笑，忽然間飛起一朶火星，飄飄颻颻的直向救火員頭上撲來，說時遲，那時快，有兩個救火員一時躱避不及，面孔上就被光顧，只聽得刺刺的幾聲，兩個人四道眉毛，已經不翼而飛了。幸虧此外倒沒有傷及，還算運氣呢。電影小說歌壇雙絶The　Cat　and　the　Fiddle(七)  墨塵　　維克多唱的歌是：　　“She　bring　you　a　new　smile　　　　　　　「她給你的，是新鮮的笑，　　for　new　lovers　do　smile　　　　　　　　　　因爲新人大抵都好笑。　　She　tempts　you　and　you　smile　　　　　她的誘惑，使你亦因之而笑，　　　A　new　love　is　told　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　新愛卽此吿成，　　She　brings　you　some　new　thriils,　她給你的，是新的驚喜，　　Some　tender　and　true　thrills,　　　　是柔情眞切的驚喜。　　Bur　after　a　few　thrills.　　　　　　　　　但經過了多少次的驚喜，　　A　New　love　is　old”　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　新愛卽此吿終。」　　他彈完了，雙手猛擊著鋼琴的鍵。「原來你有怎麽好的一支歌，」先莉說着慢慢地退出去了。他聽着她出去了，他聽見她的放聲大哭。他臉上裝假的笑容，一時都收歛了起來。先莉在鋼琴上遺留了一只手套。他將那只手套拾了起來，很悲苦地凑在唇上吻着，這就是他們愛情的惟一剩留的紀念物了。他於是將手套藏在衣袋裏，眼花撩亂地走了出去。他離開了那所他們同居的房子，他離開了她的心。　　維克多出走之後，巴黎的全城轟傳着，談論着，但是過了幾天，大家也就全都忘記了。可是先莉沒有忘記。在她的眼睛裏，有新的，堅硬的光彩……她的嘴唇亦會　着，像一位老於世故的人，……她常會無節度的狂笑……自己明白要是不大哭，就會哭出來的。在這時候，道達時時來看她，一片𤍠心的安慰着她。起初她看見他來　避了，並且討厭他送的花，恨那些花不是維克多送來的。但是慢慢地，他自己創造了一個新生命……在那個新生命裏，維克多的聲音笑貌是沒有份的。不知怎樣……她自己亦不淸楚……道達漸漸成了先莉新生命的中心了。　　她漸漸的聽見了維克多的名字，亦不傷心了。但是要是奧黛蒂的名字和維克多的名字，一同提起的時候，她終究不能掩蓋她心上的舊創痕，她終究會痛哭一晚不睡覺的。等到明天一早，她又將笑臉帶上了，硬着心腸去聽那涉及維克多的種種謠言。許多人傳說着維克多和奥黛蒂的羅曼斯，並且譏笑着奥黛蒂丈夫的　　。她聽着微笑着。直等到維克多𢌞到巴黎。維克多𢌞到巴黎，亦沒有去看看先莉。這樣使先莉覺得他果眞的將她忘記了。直到現在，她才眞的相信。（未完）</p>

<p>(Xiamen) After the 19th Route Army retreated south, the troops stationed in Quanzhou successively entered Tong'an and Zhangzhou on the 14th and 15th. Ye Dingguo's eight hundred militiamen ambushed from Lotus Mountain, but were defeated and retreated to Anxi. The main force of the 19th Route Army gathered in Quanzhou, with the front line in Yongtai and Putian, and the headquarters in Quanzhou. There were reports that Zhangzhou and Longyan were to be handed over to the Guangdong Army. According to reliable sources, after retreating to Quanzhou, the People's Government would be immediately abolished. Chen, Li, and Jiang would be removed. It was uncertain whether Cai would leave due to issues with commanding his subordinates. The Guangdong Army was actually there for consolidation and reorganization, not for assistance. If Cai left, Dai Ji would be the one to reorganize the 19th Route Army. However, there had been no concrete negotiations with Guangdong in Hong Kong. Although Cai claimed to defend Zhangzhou and Quanzhou to the death, there were still 40,000 troops remaining. However, the biggest problem was still finance. Without pay, they could not last. Transportation between Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen was still cut off, and all inland roads were also closed. Postal and telegraphic services were disrupted. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Someone who arrived in Xiamen from Quanzhou on the 15th said that Mao Weisou's troops of the 14th and 15th Armies, who retreated from the front line of the 19th Route Army, had arrived in Quanzhou. The headquarters of the Second Army was set up in Kaiyuan Temple, and Mao arrived on the 15th. The remaining troops were on foot and were expected to arrive in Quanzhou on the 17th and 18th. Zhang Yan was the last to cross the river and retreat to Yongtai to cover the rear. There were reports that the Central Army was moving south from Shuikou in pursuit. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission, reporting that he had led the Marines into the city to suppress local elements and maintain order in the provincial capital.

<p>(Xiamen) Zhang Shiyu, of the Southern Fujian Anti-Rebel Army, led Shen Donghai's troops to attack Zhangpu from Yunxiao. On the 13th, they recaptured Zhangpu County Seat.

The army is also marching towards the provincial capital. The order of the provincial capital on the 12th and 13th was extremely chaotic due to the fleeing rebels. According to front-line telegrams of the 14th and 15th, order has been gradually restored. The rebels are collapsing towards southern Fujian, and we will pursue them victoriously. The rebels attempted to invade Xiamen yesterday, but our defenses are solid, and the rebels cannot succeed. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Currently, in addition to planning to expand the Shijing Ordnance Factory, it is also planning to allocate huge sums to build another ordnance factory in Beijiang. It is reported that Chen Jitang has ordered the construction of another highway to connect the Beijiang Ordnance Factory to the station. The machinery in the new factory has been ordered from Europe, and its price reaches a total of 16 million yuan. It is reported that the construction cost of the new factory requires 5 million yuan. In the future, it can manufacture heavy artillery, machine guns, rifles, shells, and bombs. At the same time, Nanjing also frequently supplies military supplies to Guangdong.

<p>No Reception Center in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang told people that the session of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was imminent, and about six or seven tenths of the proposals from various parties had been received and were being organized. The rumor that the conference would be postponed again was not true. Central Committee members from various places have already telegraphed their departure to Nanjing. Chiang Kai-shek may be able to return in time. Since there was no need to set up a reception center in Shanghai, this proposal has been abandoned. The Nanjing reception center will be set up within the Central Party Headquarters and handled by the Social Affairs Section. The agenda of the conference will be decided at the preparatory meeting. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Political sources said that He Yingqin will not attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee due to the importance of national defense in North China and his inability to leave Beiping. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Jiqing left Beiping for Nanjing tonight to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. His proposals include: (1) Relocating the families of the deceased Northeastern Volunteer Army soldiers to the Northwest for reclamation to settle them and strengthen national defense; (2) Strengthening rural administrative agencies, because China is based on agriculture, but lacks guidance agencies, resulting in backward production, or due to inconvenient transportation, leading to low prices that harm farmers; (3) Determining national policy so that education has a direction and all construction projects can be actively carried out. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee concludes, Zhu will stay in Shanghai for a short time before going north. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is about to open, the Executive Yuan considered that the work reports of the various ministries and commissions had not been completely submitted and reordered them on the 15th to be delivered to the Yuan by the 20th, for forwarding to the Central Secretariat for presentation to the conference.

<p>(Beiping) Before Sun departed on the 12th, he issued a sixteen-character order, mimeographed and distributed to all subordinate departments, and posted along the way, saying, "Borrowing a house to avoid the wind, not interfering with political power, concentrating on fertile fields, and successively advancing westward," and so on. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun Dianying's troops occupied Dengkou County, they continued to advance south towards Shizuizi, and the situation in the Northwest suddenly became tense. He Yingqin telegraphed Sun and Ma yesterday, stopping military action and ordering Sun's troops to stop advancing to prevent the event from expanding. This morning, He Yingqin sent Director Hou Cheng as a representative to Taiyuan to meet Yan Xishan in person and discuss everything. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) This morning, Ma Hongda had a telegram from Shenshi on the 13th arriving in Beiping, saying that after Sun's troops occupied Dengkou County, they ordered a combined brigade of infantry and cavalry to attack westward. He recently received a telegram from Ma Kuai, the regimental commander stationed in Shizuizi, stating that they had made contact with our army in Shizuishan and the fighting was very fierce. "Those who resist orders and call for soldiers like this, how should they be dealt with? Please telegraph instructions to be followed," etc. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hou Cheng will go to Taiyuan tomorrow to meet Yan Xishan and request him to stop Sun's troops from advancing. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The main personnel of Sun Dianying's office in Beiping left Beiping one after another today. Only a few guards were left in the office to guard the house. When Sun's army occupied Dengkou, a certain village nearby was looted, and the Catholic church in the village was affected. It is reported that several priests were injured. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying moved from Linhe to Sanshenggong to command. Ma Hongkui will go to Pingluo to supervise the army if necessary. The Jinji Ma Hongbin Division began to move towards Ningxia Provincial City. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun's troops arrived at Shizuizi on the 13th. The Ningxia army, from that place to Pingluo, used the natural dangers to arrange tight fortifications for defense. The frontline force of Sun's army reached more than 30,000, commanded by Deputy Army Commander Yu Shiming. The follow-up troops also continued to advance through Dengkou. Sun went west from Linhe to the front line to supervise the troops. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Zongnan's troops were ordered to go to Ningxia to cooperate in defense and have arrived in Gucheng, an area at the junction of Gansu and Ningxia, and are rushing towards Ningxia Provincial City day and night. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying's troops, under the pretext of reclaiming fertile fields, have clashed with Ma Hongkui's army in Ningxia in the Dengkou area, and the situation is about to expand. It is reported that the Central Government will strictly order to stop Sun's military actions and will unify the military affairs of the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia under the command of Zhu Shaoliang, the Pacification Director stationed in Lanzhou. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Gao Mengqin, the director of Sun Dianying's office in Shanxi, said that Sun's army went west to cultivate and settle down in accordance with the Central Government's order and to make a living. They have now decided to overcome any difficulties and are determined to do so. They have no malice towards Ma and have nothing to do with the political situation. Also, Sun's troops now have a strength of about 60,000 men. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun Dianying's troops occupied Dengkou, Ma Hongkui's troops concentrated on Shizuizi for defense. Because Sun's troops continued to advance westward, a fierce conflict occurred. Due to the ambiguity of the terms of both sides' intelligence, it is difficult to determine the truth. According to Sun's telegram to Tianjin on the 14th, his troops were opening up fertile fields for cultivation and had no intention of occupying Dengkou. The rumors outside were not credible. According to Ma's telegram to Beiping on the 13th, Sun's infantry and cavalry brigades attacked westward, and conflict was difficult to avoid. What is the truth of the matter? There is no definite report here. Currently, Sun's representative, Hu Jiesan, was ordered by He Yingqin on the morning of the 15th to go to Wuyuan to meet Sun and persuade Sun to stop advancing and wait for the Central Government's order to resolve the issue.

<h3 id="e26">The Japanese Prepare to Withdraw from the Naval Treaty by Shu <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>More than a decade has passed since the Washington Conference. In the past ten years, the naval treaty, although not helpful to the chaotic situation in the world, has not really restrained the violent actions of ambitious countries, nor has it suppressed the actual expansion of the navy. However, the storms of contention for hegemony in the Pacific Ocean could be temporarily calmed, thanks to the guarantee of the Washington Treaty and the support of the London Treaty at that time.</p>
<p>Tracing back to after the end of the World War, the major European countries were either exhausted by victory or devastated by defeat, or they were caught up in revolutionary upheavals with no time for long-term planning, or they were focusing on revitalization due to insufficient national strength. Therefore, they all advocated peace, and for a time, there seemed to be a vision of international cooperation that could be realized. However, Japan in the Far East gained the fisherman's profit during this war. Domestic industries gradually developed upward, and overseas markets, in addition to the Orient being its monopoly, were increasingly reaching Europe and the West. It was truly what is called a war profiteer. During the war, the British and American countries all felt the lack of naval strength, so after the war, there was a need to re-establish the military preparation policy. The doctrine of large ships and large cannons had prevailed between Japan and the United States before 1922. The intensity of the competition at that time was no different from today. Since the establishment of the Washington Treaty until now, Japan has never forgotten the construction of the Eight-Eight Fleet (eight dreadnought battleships and eight cruisers). Although the establishment of the 5:5:3 ratio was exchanged for the benefit of the United States of America not continuing to build fortresses in Manila and Guam, Japan was therefore forced into a defensive position and could not make rapid progress, but could only engage in peaceful economic competition.</p>
<p>If this kind of economic warfare does not limit imports or have tariff barriers, then Japan, relying on its low labor costs and convenient raw material procurement, may not need to make excessive military expansion. Who would have known that after launching the September 18th Incident in the East, it has aroused great resentment among the Chinese people. Japan's position in the Far East market is actually inevitably shaken. In addition, the United Kingdom and its autonomous territories and colonies restrict the import of Japanese goods, and the United States even uses tariffs as a tool of resistance. The so-called attempt to dominate East Asia is also subject to heavy restrictions in the economic sphere. With Japan's ambition, it will never be able to endure grievances for long. However, its naval power is only sufficient to defend but not to attack, and the Pacific Ocean is more than 5,000 nautical miles apart from east to west. It is difficult for the naval fleet to attack from a distance, and even the latest weapon - the aircraft - may not be easy to fly over. Even if it can seize the Philippines and spy on Hong Kong, it is only, as the Japanese say, the injury to the limbs at most, and not the great trouble to the heart and abdomen of the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan is using the excuse of supplementing military preparations to vigorously expand its military preparations. The Second Naval Supplement Plan alone has military expenditures of 760 million yen for building warships and increasing naval air squadrons. Although the construction of these 36 warships is nominally for supplementary defense, it is actually focused on the development of light cruisers, submarines, and air squadrons. The situation is very similar to what Germany did before the Great War, wanting to wield its newly advanced sharpness to surpass Britain and the United States. This is why it is so eager to declare its withdrawal from the naval treaty in order to provide a basis for demanding naval equality.</p>
<p>Although the military power of England is old, it can still maintain the general situation and is not very weak. Its competition in building warships and its efforts to reorganize the army are not necessarily behind Japan. Observing the activeness of Singapore's port construction and the intention of India to increase tariffs, one can see this. Moreover, it has the power to sway the odds of winning between Japan and the United States in the Pacific situation. The American people's aversion to war is inherently stronger than that of European countries. If there is no great external stimulus, then the establishment and transformation of the so-called military industry and the construction of new warships will not be easily seen in practice. Now that Japan has withdrawn from the naval treaty and has gone a step further by advocating naval parity, the US government cannot but rise up and urge its people to increase naval military spending and expand naval military preparations to compete with Japan. Therefore, the result of Japan's withdrawal from the treaty can even be said to be the guide wire for launching the Second World War.</p>

<p>(Changchun) After the "Manchukuo" changes its national structure on March 1, in order to implement the reality of central centralization, it decided to fundamentally reform the local system on July 1. The focus is on dividing the most efficient administrative divisions as intermediate administrative agencies. The current provincial system is a legacy of the era of warlord separatism and can be independent as a country, so it will be abolished.</p>
<p>According to the implementation plan drafted, the current four provinces of Fengtian, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol will be divided into sixteen units, and Xing'an Province will be divided into four units. The names will still be provinces. Each province will set up a governor, like the knowledge of the affairs of the Korean province and the knowledge of the state of Taiwan. After the financial and administrative system is prepared, they will be given the power to collect local taxes and police, so that they can have the reality of local autonomous bodies, and both name and reality will eliminate the old malpractices of the feudal system.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today addressed Congress, requesting further legislation to improve the financial and monetary situation. He stated that the central government must establish a permanent hard currency reserve to organize a sound and sufficient currency. President Roosevelt advocated reducing the gold content of the dollar by at least forty percent and proposed that the entire national cash supply be nationalized. (15th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) A meeting was held at the White House today, attended by many key members of Congress. Under the guidance of President Roosevelt, they discussed currency and financial issues. Attendees included Democratic leader Robinson, Chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee Steagall, Chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee Fletcher, Senator Glass, and Senator McAdoo. General opinion believes that a decision regarding currency will be made soon to meet the Treasury's needs as outlined in President Roosevelt's budget message.</p>
<p>Regarding the borrowing of one million million yuan before June 30, the question of whether most banks can accommodate more government bonds has arisen, as the government bonds currently held by banks already account for one-third of their deposits. Experts believe that, regardless of congressional approval, the Treasury Department will receive the gold reserves of the Federal Reserve Banks, as President Roosevelt believes he has the authority to do so.</p>
<p>Experts believe the dollar will be devalued, approximately by fifty percent. However, whether Britain can agree to this price and reconcile the relationship between the pound and the dollar remains a question, and the United States firmly believes that an agreement with Britain is necessary. Experts also believe the government will ask Congress to approve the receipt of cash from the Federal Reserve Banks and the establishment of an exchange equalization fund, after which President Roosevelt will seek to stabilize world currencies.</p>
<p>No statement was issued immediately after the White House meeting. It is reported that the President's secretary, who usually releases information to the press, is currently on leave for several days, hunting in the countryside, so news releases have been temporarily suspended. However, a statement was issued by the White House shortly thereafter, stating that President Roosevelt and the Treasury Secretary had convened the Democratic and Republican members of the House and Senate banking and currency committees to discuss transferring ownership of all cash within the United States to the Treasury Department and revising the gold content of the dollar. President Roosevelt will address Congress tomorrow, announcing the transfer of cash to the Treasury Department and the devaluation of the dollar. (14th Reuters)</p>

<p>◎Argentine Capital The Argentine President Justo is now stepping in to mediate the Chaco dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay.

<p>◎Havana Cuban President Samartín, who had been in office for just over four months, suddenly resigned today. Since the beginning of August last year, Cuba has changed presidents three times. (15th Reuters)</p>
<p>◎Havana Cuban President Samartín, who seized power on September 10, 1933, relying on the army's uprising, was forced to resign today. Tonight's special edition of the El País newspaper has already published the official announcement of the President's resignation. The person who overthrew Samartín this time is none other than Sergeant Batista, who helped him become president five months ago. Trusted members of his government also rose up in protest. The revolution occurred like a bolt from the blue, with the army and navy responding in unison, so that by tonight it had become unstoppable. In addition to Sergeant Batista, its leaders include Justice Minister Armaguer, Interior Minister Guiteras, Agriculture Minister Silvia, Commerce Minister Villazcol, radical journalist Capo. Although the revolutionary headquarters has not yet announced who will succeed as president, it is rumored that National Party leader Mendietta will be promoted. Before midnight, Public Education Minister Rubio brought Samartín's resignation letter to the revolutionary army headquarters, which was meeting at a military camp outside the city. It is expected that it will not be completed until tomorrow morning, at which time the name of the new president will be officially announced. According to Samartín's friends tonight, Samartín decided to resign because of public disapproval and return to his medical practice at the University of Havana. Samartín has been active in politics and has taken refuge in the United States several times. He was the mastermind behind the revolution in September last year. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>◎Havana The coup that led to President Samartín's resignation appears to have been initiated by the Revolutionary Committee, which had previously granted Samartín power and was chaired by Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista. As for the future presidential candidate, there have been proposals for Colonel Mendietta, the leader of the nationalist faction, as well as for Contras La Tarde and Javier. The Revolutionary Committee, on the other hand, has declared that it will promote Havana Mayor De Layu to be the President. Colonel Batista advocates promoting Velgura to be the President. Interior Minister Zuderas said that the Revolutionary Committee has no problem promoting anyone as president, but on one condition, that is, it must have the approval of the military, otherwise, serious disturbances will inevitably occur. Before Samartín submitted his resignation, he held consultations with Colonel Mendietta and US Ambassador to Cuba Caffery. Samartín refused to issue a statement to the press. (15th Havas)</p>
<p>◎Havana After a brief pause, the Revolutionary Committee reconvened to discuss the matter. All sides say that the Revolutionary Committee will promote National Party leader Mendietta to be the President, succeeding Samartín. (15th Havas)</p>
<p>◎Havana Riots broke out here again last night. Employees and workers of the municipal water and electricity company went on strike, plunging the entire city into darkness, and the water supply was cut off. Doctors and lawyers have also joined the strike. The government ordered all hospitals to be closed and sent troops to evacuate the staff and patients from the hospitals. Workers at the Santiago de Cuba electricity plant also announced a strike at noon today. The government has decided to temporarily confiscate the national electricity and lighting company. At 11:00 AM, Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista sent troops to occupy all power plants and buildings belonging to the electricity company throughout the island and ordered the arrest of all strike leaders. The leader of the electricity plant workers here, Kiro, has been appointed as the temporary manager. Two hundred workers have resumed work in each plant, but most workers want to give the strike a political meaning, and it is feared that they will continue the strike. The Cuban people have shown animosity towards the electricity company for several years. During the time of former President Machado, people repeatedly demanded a reduction in electricity fees, but because Machado and Cadalin, who managed the island's electricity industry, reached a compromise, the movement ultimately failed. This time, the government has temporarily confiscated the electricity company to appease public opinion. (14th Havas)</p>

Vice Admiral Smith, along with Hader and Rear Admiral Watson, will arrive here on January 19. (15th Reuters)</p>
<p>◎Singapore Lord D'Erlanger, commander of the British fleet stationed in China, arrived here today. His arrival is to attend the British Far East Naval Conference, which will open on the 23rd of this month. The content of the meeting is not being made public. This meeting is the first to be held in nearly nine years. Singapore was selected as the meeting location in 1921, as it is extremely convenient for all participating representatives. Representatives from the East Indies Command, the commands stationed along the coast of China, and Australia and New Zealand are all attending. The meeting was last held at the end of 1925, because the situation in China was unstable at the time, and the commander of the fleet stationed in China was unable to leave his post to attend.

<h3 id="e38">Dutch Naval Budget Cuts; Shortfall of £33 Million; Naval Experts Greatly Disappointed <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>◎The Hague If the government implements the plan of the Royal Commission to the Queen of the Netherlands, the Dutch Navy will be completely reorganized and halved in size. The Dutch Navy is currently based in Amsterdam, Vlissingen, and Den Helder. Now, it is only planned to retain Den Helder, and a well-known Marine Corps regiment will be disbanded. The number of naval professionals will be halved, and Chen's ships will be demolished. The work of the Royal Commission is to save £2.5 million in army and navy expenses due to a shortfall of £33 million in the budget. Naval experts are greatly disappointed because there is now a possibility of war in the Pacific, and the Netherlands urgently needs a strong navy. They also say that the number of naval personnel has been reduced from 11,000 to 8,000 in recent years, and it is a great pity to disband the elite Marine Corps regiment founded in the 7th century.

<p>(Washington) Representatives from England, Scotland, Hawaii, and the United States gathered here today to discuss birth control issues in relation to national economic recovery. Thomson, an employee of the Scripps Foundation studying population issues, strongly argued that Italy, Germany, and Japan have had to seek greater natural resources due to population expansion. Japan's development of Manchuria is also for this reason. Japan's development is only in its early stages. He believes that when the time is ripe in the future, Japan's development will extend to parts of Borneo, New Guinea, Celebes, and the Philippine Islands. If a war breaks out in Europe, it will give Japan an unparalleled opportunity to seize the colonies of the Netherlands and Britain. (14th National News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Transfer Negotiations for Chinese Eastern Railway; Japan Hopes to Reopen and Advocates Setting Up 50-Mile Demilitarized Zone <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which had been suspended, have hopes of reopening due to a new proposal by Ambassador Yurenev on the 8th. Foreign Minister Hirota has requested that "Manchukuo" consider promoting the reopening of negotiations from the Changchun Embassy. "Manchukuo" has also internally decided to release the six former Soviet employees of the CER who were arrested last time in response to the Soviet Union's request, so the chances of reopening negotiations are increasing. The Soviet Union has also changed its previous attitude and will propose using Japanese yen as the transfer price. It is expected that the matter can be resolved in one or two negotiations. The transfer price, including all assets, is about 100 million yuan. Foreign Minister Hirota also intends to take this opportunity to propose setting up a demilitarized zone within 50 miles of the Japanese-Russian-Manchu border. Regarding Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov's statement that "Japan should sign a non-aggression treaty as evidence of its love of peace," he hopes that before the treaty is concluded, a Japanese-Russian-Manchu border commission will be set up, similar to the border commissions that the Soviet Union has concluded with its neighbors Poland and Romania. (15th Dentsu)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in light of "Manchukuo's" decision to release the arrested Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway, has decided to actively mediate the reopening of negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Hirota, in view of the problem of converting rubles into Japanese gold during the last discussion, which led to the suspension of negotiations, intends to avoid discussing such specialized issues this time and start negotiations from a new starting point based on the overall situation of Japan, Manchuria, and Russia. "Manchukuo's" policy is to take a lenient attitude towards the dismissal allowances of Russian employees and to implement special treatment for Russian goods shipped to Vladivostok, in the hope of resolving fundamental issues as soon as possible. (15th Nichiren)</p>
<p>◎Changchun It is heard that the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of "Manchukuo," Ohashi, intends to resign. Ohashi recently handled the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Tokyo on behalf of the "Manchu" government, and he was quite disappointed when the negotiations stalled.

<p>(Moscow) A dispatch from Harbin states that on January 12, Harbin police suddenly broke into the office of Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau Director Rudy, claiming that they were there to protect him because "demonstrating" crowds were approaching the railway bureau and to prevent accidents. Soon, the "demonstration" procession arrived, traveling in sixty cars. The so-called representatives included several Japanese, Chinese, and White Russians.</p>
<p>Claiming to be representatives of merchants, they demanded that Director Rudy reduce the Chinese Eastern Railway's freight rates. Rudy immediately explained that the railway bureau had repeatedly suggested reducing freight rates, but the Manchu side had always delayed the matter. The demonstrators did not understand this and only shouted slogans against the Soviet Union. A Japanese man named Ziqi (transliteration), who claimed to be a representative of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, was the most rude. Similar events occurred within the Chinese Eastern Railway Board. This move was directed at Deputy Director Bandura. In the aforementioned events, the police constantly assisted the demonstrators, because these demonstrations were organized by the police bureau. Their purpose was to unreasonably reduce the income of the Chinese Eastern Railway, thus proving that the Japanese calculation of the Chinese Eastern Railway's value was indeed declining.

<p>(London) Labour Party leader Lord Rothermere announced that he has decided to join the fascist movement advocated by Sir Mosley unconditionally. There are already two groups in the British Fascist Party: one is the British Fascist Party, which has only a thousand members, and the other is the Fascist Party British Federation, whose leader is Sir Mosley, with a membership of 20,000, and which is supported by various parties, especially by major industrialists and factory subsidies. (15th Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Labour Party leader Lord Rothermere wrote an article in the "Daily Mail" entitled "Long Live the Blackshirts," declaring that he was participating in the British fascist movement without reservation and harshly criticizing the government, saying that the British government was allowing Britain to lag behind the major aviation powers. The government's policy of appeasement has led to the loss of Southern Ireland by the British Empire, and the same policy is now being applied to India, which will also be lost. He also said that British fascism should not imitate Italian fascism, but he did not elaborate on what kind of political program the British Fascist Party would adopt. In addition, the "Daily Mail" published an editorial criticizing British foreign policy, saying that British Fascist Party leader Mosley alone is worth more than half a dozen politicians that Britain sends to Geneva and elsewhere.

<p>The Japanese Army Trains 500,000 Elite Troops in Northeast China. Strange Noises of Recovering Lost Territory. Training is to Invade North China and Defend Against Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Evasion</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Tianjin: According to recent talks with visitors from outside the pass, Japan is carrying out the puppet enthronement, which is extremely rampant. The name of the country has not yet been determined. The two names, "Great Qing" and "Manchurian-Mongolian State", have been in dispute. The location of Puyi's usurping the throne was initially planned in Changchun, but later, because the Japanese planned to further invade North China, they advocated moving the puppet capital to Rehe and usurping the throne in the Chengde Palace. This statement has been quite powerful recently. However, Chengde is very close to the Great Wall, and Puyi is afraid of being threatened by our country, so he is quite unwilling. Ritsuhikari, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, summoned Zheng Xiaoxu, the puppet prime minister, and said, "Moving the capital to Chengde is protected by the Japanese Imperial Army and will definitely be unimpeded. There will be a way in the future, as stable as a rock." Therefore, in Liaoyang, Changchun and other places, there are often calls to recover lost territory. What does he mean by "recovering lost territory"? Naturally, there is no doubt that the Japanese army is helping the puppet country to recover the lost land of the Great Qing Dynasty. I wonder what the gentlemen in our country who used to sing about recovering lost territory would think when they heard this.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the so-called zoning of Qingxiang, has long been completed. This is followed by a census, registration of household guns, and finally the complete confiscation of civilian self-defense guns. In a certain place in Liaoning, with strong folk customs and many righteous troops, he refused to surrender his weapons, killed more than 50 Japanese soldiers, and wounded two to three hundred Japanese soldiers. The headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army was furious when it heard the news, and immediately dispatched a large force to surround the area on all sides, first with a bomber squadron, then with machine guns, and finally set it on fire. The death toll reached thousands, with no chickens or dogs left, which was extremely tragic and poisonous. The Japanese side prohibited publicity, so the outside world does not know the details. Since then, no one dared to hide guns privately. Recently, the so-called training of militiamen has been implemented. All those over the age of sixteen and under the age of forty are subject to military training, supervised by Japanese officers. They are also afraid that the people will be insincere. They are drafting a village management law, in which one Japanese is assigned to each village to serve as village head, so as to monitor the people's actions. It is heard that the Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters plans to train 500,000 elite soldiers every year, and its intentions are twofold: one is to invade Guannei in the future, that is, to drive these militiamen to serve as vanguards, and implement the poisonous plan of Chinese killing Chinese; the second is that if the Japanese-Russian war unfortunately breaks out, these militiamen, even if they cannot charge into battle, will also be driven to undertake transportation, reconnaissance, etc., so as to be used.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that Japan will take Chahar and Suiyuan. This is only part of Japan's invasion of North China. Its desire for aggression is actually endless. If our country does not revitalize itself, unite and seek strength, and kill each other again, it will be creating an opportunity for Japan to invade. In the past one or two months, Japan has sent a large number of military personnel, disguised as scholars and businessmen, to apply for passports to travel or hunt in the interior of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi and other provinces of our country, secretly surveying the terrain of mountains and rivers, and investigating the customs and products. Although the local authorities sent police to follow and pay attention, they could not stop their actions, so it was useless. According to a certain important person, Japan does not want China to be on the right track politically. The more chaotic China is, the more it will benefit. Seeing that Song Zheyuan had just reorganized the miscellaneous troops in eastern Chahar, the Japanese puppet army immediately moved to eastern Chahar, intending to create disturbances by taking advantage of the situation. Now that the bandits in eastern Luan have been wiped out, the Japanese side has not returned Yuguan and other ports. If the puppets enthroned and moved their capital to Rehe, Hebei Province will inevitably have more trouble in the future. The Eastern Mausoleums inside the Great Wall are the tombs of the puppet's ancestors. In the future, they will definitely send troops to protect them under the pretext. If we refuse, disputes will arise. If we agree, they will take an inch. Hebei Province is afraid that there will be no good days. If we use the traitors again to provoke a big wave, the crisis will be even more unbearable. Our government does not focus on the big picture, but haggles over the negotiations in Yuguan and other ports, avoiding the important and taking the light, which is a great sigh. I don't know that the weaker we show, the stronger Japan will be. Japan is now unable to avoid the Far East War, so it is looking for opportunities and means, either to give our country a big punishment, or to exert pressure, so that our country has no room to resist Japan, and in the future, it can calmly deal with the huge Soviet Russia, so that there will be no worries. If we can understand this, even if the negotiations to recover the various ports of the Great Wall are successful, Japan can take them away at any time. I hope that our government will think ahead, pay close attention, and prepare for it early (January 13).</p>

<p>After the Defeat of the Fujian Army, Guangdong Strengthens Defenses on the Border | Chen Zhang's Brigade Stationed in Southern Jiangxi Returns to Dongjiang to Assist |</p>
<p>Guangzhou Newsletter: After the failure of the 19th Route Army in Yanping Shuikou, there was news that they were retreating to Zhangzhou. Zhangzhou is located in southern Fujian and is adjacent to Dongjiang in Guangdong Province. The Guangdong authorities feared that the Fujian army would retreat southward and that the defeated soldiers would enter the Guangdong border, so the defense of Dongjiang has been tense in recent days. The defense forces stationed on the border of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong are on high alert. All officers staying in the rear have returned to their posts. Li Yangjing, commander of the 3rd Army, originally planned to return to the province on the 7th of this month to report on defense matters, but this has now been suspended. He also went to Jiaoling from Meixian on the 6th to inspect. The defense forces in the Jiaoping area have also been newly deployed. On the Fujian border in Wuping, the 4th and 5th Regiments of Yan Yingyu's brigade of the 1st Independent Division are stationed. On the Jiangxi border in Jitan Chengjiang, two regiments of the 7th Division of the 3rd Army are stationed, in contact with Yan's brigade in Wuping. Huang Yanzhen, commander of the 7th Division, has arrived in Pingyuan. Huang Zhiwen, commander of the 8th Division, is stationed in Xunwu City. The 8th Division's infantry is stationed from Liuche Beiling to Xunwu Guanpu Avenue, in contact with Wang Zanbin's division of the Guangxi Army stationed in Anyuan. In the rear areas of Jiaoling, Meixian, and Xingning, there are Wu Hanping's regiment of the 1st Independent Division, the training regiment of the 7th Division, and two regiments of the 5th Division as reserve forces. In Chaozhou and Shantou, there are Zhang Ruigui's units of the 2nd Independent Division defending. In order to consolidate local security, the division has transferred the 1st Regiment of Ouyang Hong to Huilai, the 2nd Regiment of Chen Xinrong to Jieyang, the 3rd Regiment of Zhong Fangjun to Chao'an, and the training regiment of Chen Yaoshu to Puning. Chen Jitang also sent Tan Sui, deputy commander of the training division, to the front line to instruct the various armies on deployment matters. On the other hand, because the elite of various armies have been transferred to defend the Fujian-Jiangxi border, and the support in the rear must be undertaken by another strong army, the 1st Column was ordered to transfer Chen Zhang's unit of the 2nd Independent Brigade from Xinfeng to the upstream of Dongjiang in Heping Lianping counties to support everything. After receiving the order, Chen Rongqiu's unit of the 2nd Regiment set off from Xinfeng on the 8th. He Lianfang's unit of the 1st Regiment also set off from Guantangxu, Nanxiong on the 9th, taking the route through Anyuan Sannan, and heading to Lianping Heping, with the entire brigade arriving at its destination within a week. The defense area of Xinfeng left behind will be taken over by Zhang Da's unit of the 4th Division. (January 11)</p>
<p>Henan Province's Yellow River Committee Solicits the Consent of Five Provinces on Three Measures to Raise Funds for Post-Disaster Reconstruction Projects</p>
<p>Kaifeng Newsletter: Last year's Yellow River flooding severely affected Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces. To this day, there are scenes of devastation everywhere, with people crying out in hunger and cold. After the frost, there should have been celebrations of peace and prosperity as usual, but in Rongze and Heigang, the embankments have collapsed, posing an immediate threat. It is truly a case of a clever woman unable to cook without rice to engage in construction for prevention. Today, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has proposed three measures to raise these funds, sending telegrams to Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Water Disaster Relief Committee, the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the North China Water Conservancy Commission, and the authorities of the five provinces of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, soliciting their consent in order to jointly telegraph the central government for approval and implementation. In addition to Liu Zhi, who is close to the water and has expressed his strong support, it is expected that replies will be received within a few days. The original telegram from the Yellow River Committee is as follows: "It has been found that last year's Yellow River breach caused disaster to several provinces. The loss of people's lives and property is countless, and the embankments on both sides have been eroded and collapsed, which is even worse than before. If we do not urgently plan for post-disaster reconstruction and earnestly reinforce them, then the flood season will arrive in an instant, and if we encounter floods again, then the breaches and floods will invade the Wei River to the north, which may affect Tianjin and Tanggu, and seize the Huai River to the south, which may cause disaster to Jiangsu and Anhui. The disaster of the sinking of the continent is unimaginable, even in the event of a medium-to-high water level, the residents along the river will inevitably suffer from its fish. Our association is responsible for managing the Yellow River, and we look to the future with anxiety. We have sent teams to survey and estimate this post-disaster reconstruction project, but we are troubled by the lack of funds and have not started construction. The matter is urgent and cannot be delayed. We have proposed three measures to raise funds: (1) Imitate the previous Yellow River breach method and implement surcharges on railways, ships, and postal and telecommunications; (2) The relevant provincial governments should designate collateral, such as local taxes, to issue Yellow River breach reconstruction bonds; (3) Please ask the National Economic Commission to allocate some of the cotton and wheat loans to provide subsidies. Although the above two measures will inevitably increase the burden on the local people, it is necessary to think ahead and prevent the disaster, and to protect the lives and property of the people. It is proposed that our association and your government jointly send a telegram to the central government for approval and implementation. If you agree, please reply quickly by telegram in order to proceed. In addition to sending separate telegrams, this telegram is sent to you. Please check it out. Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, respectfully. (January 12)</p>
<p>Anhui Province Plans to Repair the Yangtze River Dikes | The Mahua Dike in the Upper Reaches is to be Repaired by the Economic Commission</p>
<p>Anqing Newsletter: Last summer, the Yangtze River dikes in Anhui Province faced many dangerous situations during the great flood. It was only through the efforts of the entire province that the dangers were averted. The most dangerous ones were the Mahua Dike in the upper reaches, the Huangsitankou in the lower reaches, and the Xiadachengwei in Tongcheng in the middle section, the Zhongjiaxu in Tongling, and the Pangxieji area in Fanchang. Although the rescue was successful at the time, subsequent repairs should be focused on. The Construction Department had previously telegraphed the National Economic Commission to expedite construction, and a reply was received approving that Anhui Province would handle it itself. The provincial government recently sent Pei Yixiang, director of the Provincial Water Conservancy Engineering Department, to Beijing to discuss the matter with the Economic Commission, stating the financial difficulties of Anhui Province and the need for financial assistance. It is said that Pei has returned to the province on the 11th with Liu Yiyan, director of the Construction Department. According to reports, the Mahua Dike in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will be repaired by the National Economic Commission in conjunction with the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression of the Three Provinces. The proposal to continue to complete the Jianghuai dikes has been included in the agenda of the Economic Commission's meeting and is expected to be submitted next week. As for the Construction Department, it is necessary to plan for the above-mentioned major dangerous works. For example, the Jiang Shijun, chief of the first section of the department, is currently meeting in Hankou for the Mahua Dike. The method for the Huangsitankou has been instructed to the representative of Wuwei County a few days ago. The methods for Tongling and Tongcheng have also been told to the two county magistrates when they came to the province. The Fanchang Pangxieji area is the most dangerous place in the middle reaches, and a special telegram has been sent to Wang Huai, the magistrate of Fanchang County, asking him to come to the province to personally explain everything and start construction at the same time as the other dangerous works in order to strengthen the river defenses. This has been reported to the provincial government for review and has been sent to the Civil Affairs Department for review. (January 13)</p>
<p>Theft Alarms Reported Repeatedly in Songjiang During the Winter Defense Period</p>
<p>The winter season has arrived, and various townships are organizing winter defenses to supplement the police force, but theft cases have occurred repeatedly in various townships. For example, in the Xishebang of Tianma Township, the home of a certain family was suddenly visited by seven or eight bandits speaking the dialect of out-of-towners. They were armed with weapons, tied up the head of the household, and broke into the inner room to search for valuables. However, the people in this township are known to be poor, and the bandits were not satisfied with the contents of the house. As a result, they stole two shi of white rice, two dan of duck eggs, and several bolts of cloth before escaping. On the same night, in the home of Jiang Jinlong, a villager in Xujing Village, Xiaosheshan Township, heard dogs barking outside. Knowing that there was a theft alarm, he quietly got up and looked for a gong to sound the alarm. Villagers from the same village gathered and shouted to catch the thieves. They caught sight of six or seven shadowy figures who turned around and fled, thus avoiding being robbed.</p>

Until the morning of the day before yesterday, the temperature turned warmer, and the Fahrenheit thermometer rose from 40 degrees to 42 degrees, but the sky was covered with floating clouds, and it was about to rain. Until about 3 pm, light snow fluttered. Because there had been no rain for a long time, it melted as soon as it fell to the ground. In the evening, it became more and more dense, so that the mountains, forests, and houses were all white. Stores closed early. Until about 2 pm yesterday (15th), it was still snowing. The road was piled up with mud due to the construction of road surface ditches, and pedestrians were miserable, and vehicles overturned from time to time. City and rural telephones were not damaged. Wheat in the fields was suppressed by snow, and farmers cheered, expecting a bumper harvest in the future.</p>

Unexpectedly, a male passenger about 40 or 50 years old in the boat suddenly died. The boat owner Zhang Quan looked frightened when he saw this, and immediately reported to the county court with Wu Rongmu, the head of the place. The prosecutor went to inspect and confirmed that he died of illness. After the inspection, he ordered the boat owner to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

He was immediately captured and sent to the corps headquarters. Zhou Junhua, an official of the district office, came forward to mediate and ordered him to write a letter of repentance. Hong, the county magistrate, heard about this and immediately ordered him to be dismissed and investigated. The vacancy was filled by Wang Danhuai, a patrol officer of the fifth branch. The vacancy of patrol officer of the fifth branch will be temporarily filled by Wang, a patrol officer of the water patrol team.</p>
<p>Gaoyou Government Rescues Rural Economy</p>

<p>YANGZHOU-ZHENJIANG-KYUSHU LINE INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION SCHEDULED TO BE IMPLEMENTED</p>
<p>Due to the intermodal transportation between Zhenjiang-Yangzhou long-distance buses and Kyoto-Shanghai trains, Lu Shaoliu, chairman of the bus company, Chen Xiaobo, the manager, Xie Chu Chang and Xu Tuan Chang of the Railway Bureau, agreed on the intermodal transportation contract with the Railway Bureau, during their Shanghai visit at the end of the 22nd year of the ROC. The method is that the Railway Bureau will issue intermodal transportation tickets, which will be sold at major stations in Kyoto, Shanghai, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi, as well as at the two bus stations in Yangzhou and Shiqiao. The price will be the second and third class train tickets, plus a bus fare of 1.2 yuan. Luggage will be calculated according to the regulations. All those who go to Shanghai from Yangzhou, to the bus station in Zhenjiang, will be transported to the train station by the bus company to board the train. The luggage can be delivered from the Yangzhou station and picked up in Shanghai, so as to avoid the passengers' trouble of handling it in the middle and the suffering of not being connected in time. It has now been decided to implement it from the 21st of this month, and the Kyoto-Shanghai Railway Bureau will submit a letter to the Ministry of Railways to inform the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs, instructing the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital to protect the intermodal vehicles traveling between the two stations of Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Bandits Robbed Rowing Boats in Shaobo Lake</p>
<p>Bandits and thieves abound in the area between Shaobo Green Yang Lakes in the eighth district of Jiangdu, and there are occasional cases of sailboats being robbed. Yesterday (13th), Hu Da Mao, a rowing boat from Xinghua to Yangzhou, was carrying a female passenger, Wang Zhao, and four male passengers, including Li Xiaoshan. Unexpectedly, at about 3 pm, when they were sailing to Shaobo Lake, three bandits from Haizhou and one bandit from Nanjing suddenly came. They each held a pistol and rushed over in a small boat, ordering them to stop rowing. They swarmed up, searched Wang Zhao's lawsuit fee of more than 80 yuan, Li Xiaoshan's travel expenses of more than ten yuan, and the boatman's 5 yuan and 2,000 copper coins, and then boarded the original boat and sailed away. It is said that Wang Zhao still had more than 50 yuan in banknotes, which were hidden in her trousers, and were not searched away, which can also be said to be a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Qian Aimiao Town, Danyang, Robbed by Bandits</p>
<p>Qian Aimiao Town in the northern countryside, is densely populated with shops, and has a public security station to maintain order. At about 4 pm yesterday, a small group of bandits, disguised as hawkers, first ambushed in various places in the town, and then most of them gathered together, about 40 people, surrounded the station. Suddenly, five or six bandits, headed by them, held guns and entered, scaring them from making a sound. The patrols, seeing that there were too few to fight against them, surrendered their weapons. One of the patrols resisted slightly and was shot in the arm by the bandits. At that time, the bandits ambushing in the town, swarmed up, opened fire to demonstrate, and the townspeople fled in droves. The bandits searched arbitrarily, and no shops or residents were spared. After the search, they roared away. After the inspection, it was found that the Tianchang and Tianlun cloth shops, the Runde southern goods shop, and many residents were robbed. Three rifles and one box gun were robbed from the station. The case has been reported and requested to be apprehended.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Unprecedented Heavy Snow</p>
<p>Since the afternoon of the 14th), the city of Hangzhou has been extremely cold, with heavy snow falling from the sky, which lasted until 12 o'clock at night.

<p>Withdrawing Yangtze River Water Hinders Navigation, Wuhu Falls to Nine Feet Eight Inches, New Dike Water Level Only Seven Feet, Upstream and Downstream Vessels Run Aground In recent days, the Yangtze River's water level has greatly decreased. Vessels traveling upstream and downstream have been suddenly affected by the reduced water level, and have been successively hindered and run aground. Those carrying more cargo or with slightly heavier drafts have been unable to navigate. Various Shanghai-based river vessels have already been affected by the shallow waters. The details are urgently being investigated and recorded as follows: River Level Drops Sharply The Yangtze River water level, from the Hubei-Hunan section above Hankou and the Shashi-Yichang section, had already sharply decreased half a month ago. In recent days, the situation has worsened. Vessels with deeper drafts cannot travel on the route from Hankou to Changsha. Only shallow-water river vessels can pass on the Chongqing-Yichang route. Unexpectedly, starting from the afternoon of the 13th, the water level in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River also suddenly dropped. From Jiujiang onwards, the shallowest area is the section from downstream of Anqing to Wuhu. The water level dropped from fifteen feet to eleven feet, and then from eleven feet to nine feet eight inches. Larger river vessels have all been hindered. Dispatching Vessels for Transshipment On the 14th, the river water level dropped to nine feet eight inches. Upon investigation, the current Yangtze River vessels of various companies have drafts of at least ten feet or more. Larger vessels, such as the Jiangshun, Jiang'an, and Jianghua, have drafts of twelve feet seven or eight inches. The drafts of the Sanbei river vessels also reach twelve or thirteen feet. This water level reduction of several feet has caught the vessels unprepared. The Sanbei's Changxing vessel arrived in Wuhu on the 14th. When the river water level dropped to nine feet eight inches, the vessel was immediately hindered and unable to proceed upstream. The owner, Dingxi, urgently telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, requesting the prompt dispatch of tugs to Wuhu to transship the passengers and cargo on board to Hankou, in order to avoid delaying the passengers' journeys. The Shanghai bureau has already dispatched vessels for transshipment. Reduced Water Level at Madang In these two days, it has been very difficult for Yangtze River vessels, whether traveling upstream or downstream, to navigate. The water level at Madang has dropped even more significantly. The Sanbei's Wanxiang vessel, which departed from Shanghai this time, ran aground on the Madang river surface due to the sharp drop in water level. Because the Wanxiang is a sea-going vessel with a deeper draft, and it was also carrying cargo and passengers, it ran aground on the Madang river surface. After a whole night, it managed to leave the shoal the next morning by using reverse thrust during the high tide. It has now reached Hankou. River vessels of other companies passing through Madang and Wuhu are also being hindered. Difficult Navigation at Xindi In the section of Chenglinji and Xindi upstream of Hankou, after the 13th of this month, the upstream river water flowed downstream very quickly, and the river level has been reduced to about seven feet. Commercial vessels traveling along the Hunan-Hubei route frequently run aground when passing through Xindi. The Sanbei Company's Hongzhen and Hongheng vessels were also stranded at Xindi due to the reduced water level and unable to move. The Shashi branch has dispatched a large number of workers and barges to the area to unload the cargo from the two vessels before towing them out of the shallows. Reduced Vessel Load Capacity on Hunan-Hubei Route Shipping costs have already increased on the Hunan-Hubei route due to the shallow waters. Starting yesterday, the Yangtze River vessels of various companies have reduced their loading of passengers and cargo to prevent excessive drafts and the risk of running aground midway. According to the vessels' fixed quotas, they are loading at most 60% of their capacity. River vessels are incurring significant losses in this way. Suspension of Navigation to Yichang A telegram arrived from Hankou yesterday stating that the water level reading was five feet five inches (this is a report of the water level with the bottom scale), while Yichang only had two feet five inches, and Changsha was even lower, with only eight inches remaining. As a result, except for small shallow-water vessels that can barely navigate, the remaining upper Yangtze River vessels are difficult to operate. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Heyun vessel, which was originally scheduled to serve the Yichang route, telegraphed an order yesterday to unload cargo in Hankou and stop proceeding to Yichang, returning to Shanghai instead. Other vessels have also suspended navigation to Shashi and Yichang. Navigation Association Circular Notifying Members to Copy and Issue Anti-Piracy Escort Regulations, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Sanbei Company Comply The Shanghai Navigation Trade Association, upon receiving instructions from the Ministry of Communications and the promulgation of the Anti-Piracy Escort Regulations by the Executive Yuan, specially sent letters to all members yesterday to comply. Various Chinese merchant shipping companies have also separately established anti-theft mechanisms on their vessels. The Navigation Trade Association issued a circular to various shipping companies yesterday, stating: "To: This is to inform you that the Ministry of Communications' Instruction No. 74 and the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 68 stipulate that the Anti-Piracy Escort Regulations have been formulated and officially promulgated by this Yuan and should be immediately enforced. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the regulations is enclosed for your compliance and for instructing your subordinates to comply accordingly." This order, etc., includes a copy of the Anti-Piracy Escort Regulations. Upon receiving this, in addition to separate orders, a copy of the regulations should be copied and issued to the association for reference and implementation. Yours sincerely. Attached is a copy of the Anti-Piracy Escort Regulations (already recorded in this newspaper on the 14th, omitted for brevity). Various Vessels Comply With the Regulations The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the privately-owned Sanbei, Hong'an, Ningshao, Zhengji, Dada, Datong, Daxing, and Huxing shipping companies, in view of the prevalence of piracy along the coasts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and the frequent hijacking of merchant ships, have now completed comprehensive preparations as a precautionary measure. This includes adding inspectors to conduct thorough investigations when vessels depart, in order to prevent pirates from infiltrating. They are also installing anti-theft mechanisms on the vessels, similar to those used on Taikoo vessels, such as locking the doors of the engine room, engine compartment, captain's bridge, and passenger cabins at the time of departure. They are also adding wireless radio stations. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is also increasing the number of escort police. People's Whereabouts Zeng Zhongming, Zou Lin, Chu Minyi, and others took the night express train to Beijing last night. The Contract Between China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Jiaoji Railway for Water-Land Intermodal Transport Has Been Approved and Is Ready for Signing The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Jiaoji Railway are jointly operating water-land intermodal transport. After the Qingdao branch manager of the company, Sun Zhenwu, and the authorities of the railway negotiated a draft contract, it was submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. It was then handed over to Manager Sun to bring to Shanghai to report to the head office. It is now learned that the contract will be submitted to the board of directors for reporting this Thursday and can then be signed. Regarding this intermodal transport matter, the company will completely entrust it to the Qingdao branch for handling. The branch and the railway have already implemented some aspects of water-land intermodal transport. After the contract is signed, formal implementation can be realized within days. In addition, the company has dispatched personnel from the business department to negotiate with the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways for intermodal transport. It is reported that a draft contract has been prepared and will be submitted for discussion. However, there has been no progress recently (Central News Agency). The Fisheries Protection Office Dispatched Four Warships Yesterday to Protect Fishing The Ministry of Industry has revoked the Fisheries Administration and established a Fisheries Protection Office. As the original site of the former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Fisheries Administration at Shoufang, Guoging Road, Shanghai, is inconvenient for dispatching patrol ships, it is planning to find a suitable location on the Bund to set up an office. However, there are very few remaining buildings along the Bund, so the originally planned relocation within this month is impossible. The patrol ships of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong Administrations, except for the two patrol ships of the Fujian-Guangdong and Hebei-Shandong regions that have not yet been taken over by the office, such as the Haihong, Haigu, Haiying, and Biaohai vessels of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region, were dispatched yesterday to protect fishing. The plan is as follows: (1) Haiying patrols the area of Shenjiamen and Shengshan; (2) Haigu defends the area between Chongming Island and Shengshan; (3) Haihong is responsible for the area from Shenjiamen to Wenzhou and Taizhou; (4) Biaohai is dispatched to patrol various locations at any time. According to the director, Yuan Jiahua, the fishing protection by each ship is sufficient. The winter fishing season is about to end, and the spring fishing season will begin in about one and a half months. The office will follow the past procedures of the Administration and protect fishing in sections. The Ministry of Communications' Zhenru Power Plant Was Established Yesterday The electricity used by the Ministry of Communications' International Telecommunications Bureau in Shanghai was previously borrowed from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The Bureau recently requested the Ministry of Communications to establish a power plant in Zhenru because the electricity supply from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was sometimes interrupted. The plant was officially established yesterday, and all the equipment has been purchased and is complete. The total power output is 600 horsepower. From now on, the plant will supply all the required electricity. The Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Stamp Tax Bureau Stating That Only One Cent Should Be Affixed to Invoices and That There Was No Underpayment, and That the Fines Should Be Returned in Full The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jiangsu Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau yesterday, stating: "To: This is to inform you that on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Pharmaceutical Trade Association stating that our member, Yichengtai Ji Company, reported that on December 9, 1933, the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau suddenly informed our company to pay a fine of ten yuan. Our company was unaware of the reason and had no idea what was going on, so we had no choice but to pay the full amount of ten silver dollars and took back the fine receipt and a copy of our company's invoice to find out the details. According to Article 2, Category 1, Item 15 of the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations, the first item listed is invoices, and there are provisions for affixing one cent of stamp tax to each of the above seven types, with no distinction made based on the amount of the invoice. Therefore, affixing one cent of stamp tax to an invoice is not inconsistent with the regulations. So what is meant by 'insufficient,' and on what basis is the penalty imposed? Such violations of regulations and arbitrary imposition of fines leave merchants with no place to stand. Therefore, we request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to argue based on reason, so as to quell the tyranny and maintain the difficulties of merchants. This would be most appreciated. Attached are a copy of the invoice and the fine receipt." Based on this, we should forward the previous situation to your bureau for serious negotiation, so as to reassure merchants and demonstrate justice. We also extend our official friendship. Attached is a copy of the invoice and the fine receipt. The Yichengtai Ji Company's invoice is an invoice for goods, which is listed in Article 2, Category 2, Item 1, and the last paragraph states that each of the above seven types should be affixed with one cent of stamp tax. It does not increase with the amount of the price, as is the case with receipts for money, which should be affixed with two cents for amounts over ten yuan. Since the company's invoice has already been affixed with one cent of stamp tax, it is not considered insufficient according to the regulations. The fine receipt issued by your bureau states that there was one insufficient stamp invoice and a fine of ten yuan. This penalty seems to be unfounded according to the regulations. We hereby send the invoice and receipt together, requesting your bureau to re-examine and return the fine in full. We sincerely extend our official friendship." Workers at the Old Tin Packing Factory of the British American Tobacco Company Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Mediation on the Dispute Is Scheduled for Tomorrow The workers at the old tin packing factory of the British American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui, Pudong, went on strike last Friday due to the factory's change in working hours and increased workload. After the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union submitted a request for mediation to the Party and government authorities, all workers returned to the factory as usual to work from 7:00 am yesterday. The Municipal Party Department dispatched Lu Yinchu to Pudong yesterday to persuade the workers to wait patiently for a solution. However, due to the insistence of both parties, there was still no solution. At that time, the workers were filled with indignation and resolved to deal with the situation together. Subsequently, a representative from the Party Department convened all the workers and repeatedly persuaded them, and they finally agreed to accept mediation on the dispute, which is scheduled to be held formally at the Bureau of Social Affairs tomorrow. Rotary Club Meeting The Tianjin Rotary Club of Shanghai, which was established more than a year ago, held its first dinner meeting of the year at the Dengtuomo Hotel on Sichuan Road yesterday. Many club members attended, and four new members joined, making it a grand occasion. As there are many club members in Shanghai, they plan to make further requests. However, as it is difficult to investigate bandits, they are eager for students to go to No. 6 Sichuan Road and contact Mr. Fan, the executive officer. The Municipal Party Department Completed Its Relocation and Is Now Operating at the New Location; Plans to Allocate Part of the Building as Dormitories for Department Staff The Shanghai Municipal Special Party Department moved the statistics, investigation, organization, and propaganda sections to the new site in Fenglinqiao last week. Over the weekend, it also moved the Civil Training Section, Secretariat, Standing Committee Office, and Supervisory Committee to the new location. After organizing and arranging the facilities, all staff of the Municipal Party Department are now working at the Fenglinqiao site as of yesterday. Yesterday was Monday, and during the memorial week ceremony, Secretary Jiang Huaisu reported on the relocation process. For staff who live far away, it is planned to open another part of the building as a dormitory. The Grand Opening of the Yifeng Enamel Company's Ximen Branch The Yifeng Enamel Company, a leader in the Chinese enamel industry, held the grand opening of its Ximen branch yesterday morning. Invitations were sent to guests from all walks of life to visit. The storefront sign used standard art fonts. The interior decoration was beautiful, with the walls and display windows in a cream color, interspersed with coffee-colored art lines. Its modernity was unprecedented. The various "Golden Coin" brand enamelware on display were bright and colorful, catching the eye. The auditorium was located on the second floor, and guests from all walks of life gathered. The opening ceremony was held after the clock struck nine times. The general manager of the company, Mr. Dong Jifu, delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches from guests. The speeches were insightful and stated that the efforts of Yifeng Company are worthy of our admiration. The creation of the "Golden Coin" brand enamel basins has already surpassed others, and other products, such as powdered refractory bricks and crucible decals, are successful examples of resisting foreign goods and occupy an important position in the history of national goods. From what we know now, the company's future is unlimited. Then, the manager of the company, Mr. Dong Xiyan, gave a response speech, followed by refreshments. The guests left one after another, while downstairs, customers were crowded and surrounded the store in several circles. People were talking noisily, and the staff were overwhelmed with customers. The Grand Opening of the New Asia Hotel Yesterday (the 15th), the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road held its official opening ceremony in the large auditorium on the seventh floor of the hotel. More than a thousand guests attended, including Chen Bingqian, Chen Huanzhi, Zhou Qingquan, Li Zhaohuan, Guo Le, Huang Huanfu, Li Minzhou, and Ri Xi. The ceremony began with a speech by Chairman Zhao Jinyan, followed by speeches by Mayor Wu and Mr. Xu Shiying, Wang Zhengting, and Lin Kanghou. The general manager, Mr. Zhong Biao, then gave a reply speech. After the ceremony, the hotel staff guided the guests to visit the various departments and provided refreshments. The Popularity of the Siming Series of Books Published by Yue Yuan The Siming series of books published by Zuo Yuxi and engraved by the Zheng Gao family is a collection of Siming works by Siming people. Since the Song Dynasty, for over six hundred years, various prefectures and counties in Zhejiang have mostly engraved books from their own prefecture or county, but Siming was the only exception. Previously, Zhang Shouyong, the Minister of Finance, specially initiated the engraving of the Siming series of books to promote Zhejiang's culture. The first collection of twenty-four types has already been completed and is selling well. This book is widely collected and has been carefully selected by Zhang himself. It is not only a collection of Siming's cultural allusions but also a treasure trove of Chinese art. The format imitates Bao's Zhibuzu Zhai series of books.

The factory had more than 20 power looms and was a large-scale operation with many workers. It had been in business for many years and was relatively prosperous. However, at 1:20 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in Room 4 of the factory due to a short circuit in the electrical meter box. The fire quickly spread through the roof.

He was usually diligent in his work and rarely smiled. However, his salary was only 14 yuan per month, and after paying for food and other expenses, little was left. His 70-year-old mother, wife, and child still lived in his hometown, and they had no permanent property, so he often felt financially strained. A few days ago, Left received a letter from his wife's brother, which was full of reproaches. In a fit of depression, he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Left was on duty, frowning and sighing frequently, but no one paid attention. Around 12:00 PM, after his shift, he walked up to the third-floor dormitory of the police station. At that time, all the police officers in the dormitory were out on duty, leaving only the young servant Zhang Dehai on guard. Left took out 14 copper coins from his pocket and asked Zhang to go out and buy cigarettes. Zhang saw that Left still had cigarettes in his pocket and replied that there was no need to buy more. Left immediately scolded him for not needing to be consulted. Zhang went out to buy cigarettes. Unexpectedly, Left took this opportunity to point the muzzle of his rifle at his chest, wrap a rope around the trigger, and step on the end of the rope. With a loud bang, the bullet flew out of the muzzle and pierced his chest, causing him to fall to the ground and die instantly. When Zhang returned to the dormitory with the cigarettes, he was shocked to see this scene. He immediately reported it to Chief Shen, who instructed the local patrol officer to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for an inquest. Around 3:00 PM, the prosecutor and others arrived at the scene and determined that Left Zhihua had committed suicide with a gun. His body was handed over to his cousin, Left Zicai, to prepare a coffin for burial. After the inquest, they returned to the court to report.

<p>Yesterday was Monday. Banks opened, and market sentiment was buoyant, especially as the end of the accounting period approached. Various annual procedures were mostly completed, so the silver and money industry's handling of affairs became increasingly busy. The situation in the foreign exchange market remained flat. The same price of six cents prevailed in both the morning and afternoon markets, consistent with the previous day.

In the morning market, fund transfers amounted to over 5.1 million, while new transactions totaled 700,000 to 800,000. Transactions in the afternoon market exceeded 400,000, and transactions within the Small General Association exceeded 600,000.

After the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Incident, It Became Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Jiangsu-Zhejiang small foreign coins was 846 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an improvement of two yuan compared to the previous day.

Copper coins increased by 500 wen to 295,500 wen, with transactions totaling over 34,270 strings, equivalent to 11,600 yuan in foreign currency. Securities Increased, and Public Bonds Slightly Rose Before Falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the naval recovery of Fuzhou, the general sentiment was that the long positions' desired good news had been fully achieved. With the Southwest sending troops to the Fujian border and the conflict between Sun and Ma in the North, nervous individuals speculated excessively. In reality, these events should not have had any impact. The slight rise and subsequent fall in market prices were due to the release of excess long positions, while short positions, which were in a state of fear, seized this unexpected opportunity, and speculators engaged in selling, resulting in this phenomenon in market prices. In terms of trading volume, due to fewer settlements and more new sales, the number of open positions actually increased. Recently, whether the Fourth Plenary Session can be held as scheduled and whether the meeting will yield positive results are closely related to the rise and fall of market prices. Yesterday morning, the opening prices showed some short covering and new buying, but the upward momentum did not meet the expected expectations. The most significant increase was only six to seven jiao, indicating that there was also some release of long positions. The number of buyers gradually decreased, and market prices also weakened gradually. The reverse trend in consolidated taxes, with small denominations increasing by 1.2 jiao to 4.5 jiao, was unexpected. In the second session, the release of long positions was even more pronounced, and market prices fell uniformly by 3.4 jiao to about 1 yuan. In the afternoon, the trend stabilized slightly, with both sessions showing alternating ups and downs and minimal fluctuations. In terms of market prices, except for the slightly better performance of the current month's consolidated and "19" customs duties, with an increase of 2.3 jiao, the rest reversed and fell by 1.2 jiao to 5.6 jiao. The trend may fluctuate. The total trading volume was 18,173,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot transactions, 6,395,000 yuan in consolidated salt taxes, 3,310,000 yuan in disarmament, 1,935,000 yuan in "19" customs duties, 2,855,000 yuan in 20-cigarette taxes, and 2,180,000 yuan in short-term gold, with the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to over 800,000. New York Stock Market Mixed</p>
<p>New Fung Company reported on the 13th that the New York stock market was calm but mixed. However, due to the Yang Market's Steelworks' volume rising sharply from 26% to 37%, steel stocks rose several cents to three dollars. Bonds initially rose but then retreated, resulting in a mixed outcome. Commodity changes were also minimal. The U.S. dollar was active. It was reported that the United States purchased all of its gold in London today for a total of 2,747,250 yuan. In summary, the stock market traded 750,000 shares in half a day. (Wheat) The market was strong, with spot prices firmer and the situation still favorable to buyers. (Cotton) Prices rose due to short-term expectations of a gold decision and hopes for a stable currency policy. Government releases were absorbed by factories, and there were reports of significant spot demand at peak prices. The gold purchasing price for the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation was 34.06 yuan per ounce, unchanged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below.</p>

<p>Large Short Positions Cover Standard Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly, but the situation remained flat. However, with foreign cotton trending higher, sentiment tightened slightly, and selling pressure eased. Nevertheless, spot yarn sales remained brisk, with no increases in volume from various groups, influenced by gold prices. Secondly, due to the thick inventory, the upward momentum was relatively weak.</p>
<p>(Improved Yarn Prices by Four to Five Jiao)</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market rose by 2, 4, 6, and 8 jiao following the foreign cotton trend. Some large players covered short positions. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn business was minimal, and prices in various months fell slightly by 1 to 4 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 11,500 bales. Among them, Dafeng sold 1,450 bales, Chunji 400 bales, Yuda 300 bales, Yuanda 900 bales, and Shenji 800 bales.

<p>Forward Cotton Hits New High Price</p>
<p>The cotton market saw a renewed upward trend, with U.S. cotton trending higher and Indian cotton black market prices rising sharply by 4 rupees. As a result, sentiment hardened. Ningbo groups made substantial purchases. However, a long position from a certain factory took the opportunity to release positions, curbing the upward momentum. In the afternoon, there were rumors in the market that foreign cotton would continue to rise, and buying pressure intensified again. Forward months hit new high prices. However, the yarn market remained sluggish.</p>
<p>(Long Positions Active in Standard Cotton)</p>
<p>The opening of the Zheng Standard cotton market saw long positions actively buying due to the sharp increase in U.S. cotton prices. Prices in various months rose by 1, 3, and 4 jiao. In the afternoon, prices in various months rose again by 0.5 to 2 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 100,300 dan.

<p>March 4200 217,500</p>
<p>Total 845,900</p>
<p>(Mills' Interest in Raw Cotton Weak)</p>
<p>Demand for spot cotton remained flat. Mills showed little interest in purchasing raw materials due to the lack of sales for yarn. The sources included 1,395 bales of Yao cotton and 2,540 bales of Tong cotton. The spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhangde Cotton 43.50 Public and Dada Factory Purchased 150 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Luoyang Cotton 45.50 Shanghai Factory Purchased 264 Pieces Also</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 41.75 Zhentai Factory Purchased 120 Pieces Also</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 39.15 Dong Cotton Firm Purchased 207 Pieces Also</p>
<p>Stack Delivery Last Week Bombay Cotton Cloth Became More Active</p>
<p>Last week, Bombay market prices rose following the increase in U.S. cotton prices. At the same time, Japan lifted its boycott, and the local market became more active, leading to a rapid increase in market prices. Arrivals from inland areas increased due to higher prices. However, with the recovery of purchasing power in the agricultural sector, further progress is expected. In terms of spot goods, Japanese exporters made large purchases, and with improved cotton conditions and the resolution of the Indo-Japanese dispute, there are signs of expansion in local factory demand. Therefore, factories have expressed interest in various standard cottons. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>

<p>Grains and Flour Market Remained Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the prices for each month showed a stable trend. With the quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago and Canada were both good at about 23 jiao. Therefore, morale was good after the opening. For the current month, due to the pull-in of excess long positions, the mills' intention was also not to see lower prices. Therefore, the opening price was stable. For each month in the forward market, with very few selling parties, the market trend was generally set. Therefore, they were also slightly better. By the afternoon opening, the current month once reached 1.6 jiao, and then a certain factory sold over 10,000 bags, showing a slightly flat trend. The forward market saw a stable trend due to a slight activity by external players as mills did not exit. The result was that the current month was better than the previous week by 1.25 fen, February was better by 1 fen, March and April were better by 1.25 fen, May was better by 1.5 fen, and June was better by 1 fen. Wheat Market Divergence Between Futures and Spot</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, trading in each month was extremely light. Only February saw an opening price, and the rest did not open. By the afternoon opening, the trend in each month showed weakness. In the current month, morale was flat due to the arrival of goods from inland areas. Due to settlement relations, Jiangbei Gang Chao Qing-packaged wheat was waiting to be sold, and the market eased. The forward market was slightly weak as there were very few buyers. As a result, the current month was down 4 fen compared to the previous week, and March was down 2 fen. The spot wheat market remained stable and popular. With major factories showing a strong appetite for purchases, the premium for special grades was expected to reach 1 jiao. Medium and subgrades also needed to be above 4 yuan. 1,000 bags of Wuhe wheat and Yaowan wheat were priced at 4.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Rare Arrival of Rice Boats Amid Rain and Snow</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Due to rain and snow, the arrival of boats from various groups was extremely rare, totaling only more than twenty (more than 3,000 shi). Although the outflow slowed down, sentiment was slightly firm due to the rain and snow. Buyers of late rice in bulk were all taking small-price goods. More than 1,000 packages taken by the Dalian and Qingdao groups were all medium-grade late rice such as Fengjing and Xilian. Only a few packages of Qingzhou and Songjiang goods were loaded onto the wharf. The market for thick japonica and Duyangjian from various groups was slightly tight due to the rare arrival and market sentiment. The market fluctuated slightly, with varying differences. Bianyang Yuan remained unaffected.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Over ten boats arrived from various routes. Due to the continuous rain and snow, few transactions opened. The market conditions remained stable for each variety.</p>
<p>Passenger Xian Sales Recover</p>
<p>Yesterday's passenger Xian market saw improved sentiment due to the end of the Fujian Incident. Sellers were uniformly optimistic, and asking prices increased by 5 fen. However, buyers found the prices too high and were unwilling to buy. Some sellers were also willing to sell early. As a result, the market was active, and prices did not increase. The Fuzhou group immediately searched and procured 345 packages of Hunan machine-milled red rice at 6.5 yuan and 1,000 packages of brown red rice at 5.5 yuan. The prices were similar to yesterday, but the market and sentiment were greatly invigorated by the Fujian group's resumption of purchases. If brisk sales continue in the future, prices may rise further.</p>
<p>Soybean Sales Continued Uninterrupted</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean trend was quite stable. The arrival of supplies continued steadily, and sales remained constant. Market sentiment was good. Due to the smooth sales of soybean cakes, factory appetite was tight, and prices were gradually increasing by 23 fen. Yesterday, a factory purchased a carload of Huaiyuan beans at 3.3 yuan, two carloads of Bengbu beans at 3.23 yuan, and 200 packages of Guide beans at 3.42 yuan. The Xuzhou group purchased 600 packages of Xuzhou beans at 3.45 to 3.3 yuan. An inland group purchased 5 carloads of Yingzhou beans at 3.45 to 3.3 yuan. 3 carloads from this street were sent to Zhengyangguan at 3.57 to 3.44 yuan. In addition, 100 packages of Haozhou beans were priced at 3.32 yuan, and 100 packages of Xuzhou large-material beans were priced at 3.61 yuan. There were also over 100 packages of soybeans exported to Zhengyangguan at 3.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Chaoqing Transactions Exceeded 1,000 Packages</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was flat and weak due to the slight change in customs gold. The association set the price for grade 24 raw sugar at 18.87 yuan, with no changes. Several hundred packages were transacted. Re-export goods were priced at 6.3 yuan. Dutch red sugar was priced steadily, with re-export goods priced at 6.75 yuan. Taikoo sugar was priced at the original price. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white sugar was still priced at 17.9 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, and 4 were discounted accordingly. Transactions involving Chaoqing sugar became more active. Over 1,000 packages were transacted at a firm price. Prices for local delivery ranged from 12.5 yuan to 12.23 yuan, down to 12 yuan, and from 11.7 to 11.5 yuan. Zhuqing sugar</p>

<p>Shun Pao Local Supplement, Idle Talk, The Sleepless Year of College Students</p>
<p>Yi</p>
<p>A senior in college said to me, "People talk about 'Women's National Products Year,' 'Children's Year,' 'Movie Year,' but I say this senior year for us college students is the 'Sleepless Year'." Without waiting for me to ask for clarification, he continued, "Sir, you see, graduation is near, and what then? No capital for studying abroad. Going into society to serve? Or rather, to find a job? There are so many unemployed people; how easy is it to find a bowl of rice? So, not mentioning graduation is fine; we can still go to class and leave class muddle-headedly. But as soon as graduation is mentioned, the problem of life after graduation keeps you awake every night!"</p>
<p>This college student is naturally a poor, studious, clear-headed, and insightful young man who has such worries. If one treats school as a hotel, and the purpose of studying is merely a diploma—or even if a diploma doesn't matter to the wealthy children—then the question of "what after graduation?" is easily answered: "Study abroad after graduation." However, how many graduates from each university can study abroad? The vast majority are those who must seek a living after leaving school. Thinking about the difficulties of seeking a living in society after graduation, and thus "staying awake every night," proves that college graduates have no way out and also proves the bankruptcy of university education. This is indeed a powerful piece of evidence for those who believe in the "uselessness of university education." However, those who believe in the "uselessness of university education" have already been...</p>
<p>杞人憂天,</p>
<p>SOME college students living through the "sleepless year" also seem to be "imbeciles" and not talents "worthy of national heroes." The ancients said, "Those who excel in learning should become officials." That is to say, after graduation, the National Government holds higher examinations. Those who succeed immediately become officials with delegated authority. This is the way out that the government opens for college graduates. No matter how dark the officialdom is, "disaster officials" are constantly being manufactured. However, becoming famous at once brings fame and glory to the ancestors. Enjoying happiness in reality, rising in rank in the future, and also making a fortune along the way—how wonderful is that? This is the broad path of "the way of the university," open and waiting for college students to race towards. If one becomes an official, the task is to promote the way to make money, rising from a small official to a high-ranking official, achieving both wealth and status. That is to say, the way of the university is to make money, to rise in rank, and to reach the top. The second is "abandoning the pen for the sword," that is, joining the army after graduation. Aren't college students now undergoing "military training"? Besides that set of life tactics of flattering superiors with "Raise your gun, salute!" there is also that set of necessary tactics of opening fire to kill others with "Lie down, aim, fire!" Once the situation arises and one's luck is strong, when imperialism forcefully occupies some province of China—I can guarantee that you will rise in rank and make a fortune. Even if the times are not right, you can "retreat the defensive line." At that time, the people's donations will have already entered your pockets, so-called reaping both fame and fortune. Isn't that wonderful? If unfortunately, civil strife arises within the country, you can also adapt to the circumstances and cope effectively, immediately rising from brigade commander to division commander, and from division commander to army commander, becoming famous and wealthy. It is also the so-called reaping both fame and fortune. Isn't that joyous? There are many other ways out...too numerous to list.</p>
<p>However, I must say again that many college students today are clear-headed and insightful, and will definitely not run towards the above-mentioned wrong paths. Therefore, when they are seniors about to graduate, they inevitably stay awake every night, and the year of studying becomes the "Sleepless Year." Alas!</p>
<p>Difficult Task for the God of Wealth</p>
<p>Mu Lang</p>
<p>"Sir, please check a lottery number for me," a young and beautiful woman, with a hopeful smile, asked the bank clerk inside the copper railing, her voice slightly trembling; while taking out a small note from her inner pocket, she carefully recited: "Two two zero eight six four, sir, do you have this number?"</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment," the bank clerk replied, taking out a book from the drawer to check. After some examination, he said casually, "This number exists, but it was sold yesterday," and added at the end, "If you had come a day earlier, you might have been able to buy it."</p>
<p>"Really?" the young woman said with a surprised look, but on her face, slightly flushed with excitement, a glimmer of undying hope still flickered, apparently she still had a general courage of self-confidence, so that courage encouraged her to say:</p>
<p>"Then there must be one or two strips left unsold. One strip is enough for me."</p>
<p>"This number was sold in a whole sheet."</p>
<p>"Can't you get back one or two strips, sir?" Despair dominated her entire body; clearly, this sentence was her forced struggle against despair.</p>
<p>"How is that possible?" The bank clerk struck a match, lit a cigarette, and casually uttered this rhetorical question along with the smoke. After a long while, he seemed to seriously ask her—"But why did you specifically want to buy this number?"</p>
<p>Two pairs of eyes met, one pair a little playful, the other shy.</p>
<p>"It's just having a dream," the woman said with a restrained smile. "Since you have already sold it, there's no need to say more. But I remember that dream very clearly. I have never had such a clear dream before. I clearly saw a lottery ticket with the number two two zero eight six four placed in front of me, not moving... Alas, since the God of Wealth wanted me to get rich, why didn't he entrust this dream to me a little later? Isn't this intentionally teasing me?"</p>
<p>The woman walked out of the bank door with lingering anger, forgetting to thank the bank clerk or say "See you tomorrow."</p>
<p>At this time, a group of young men inside the copper railing showed their liveliness, everyone watching the woman leave, turning around, each exchanging a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, why didn't you ask her for an address just now? Wasn't that ticket sold to ×× yesterday? I can go talk to them, maybe they can return one or two strips. But now it's too late," said Xiao Lu, who was enthusiastic and meddlesome, implying a regretful feeling.</p>
<p>"Who asked you to worry about it?"</p>
<p>Xiao Lu couldn't answer for a moment, so everyone laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, do you still remember the number just now?" Another person surnamed Wang said, taking out a diary from his pocket. "Tell me quickly, let me add it to my record."</p>
<p>"Two two zero eight six four," Old Zhang said.</p>
<p>"Two two zero eight six four," that person said, writing and reciting at the same time, and then pointing the pen at the numbers already written in the diary, counting one by one, "Okay, including this number, there are thirty-seven in total, none of them are the same. According to the people who came to buy them, these numbers all came from dreams, and the dreams were very clear. But the aviation lottery cannot have thirty-seven first prizes."</p>
<p>"Ah Wang, among these thirty-seven numbers, how many were bought? How many were not bought?" Xiao Lu asked.</p>
<p>"Twelve people went back with hope, the rest were disappointed."</p>
<p>At this time, an elderly old man wearing short clothes walked into the counter from the door, limping, and sincerely asked this group of people who were laughing, "Sir, could you please check a lottery number for me, one seven six three eight zero."</p>
<p>The old man's hoarse tone interrupted their interest in talking and laughing, so everyone buried their heads in their duties. Old Zhang flipped through the book listlessly, and unexpectedly found that this number existed and had not been sold.</p>
<p>The old man tremblingly took out a dollar, exchanging it for a hope to take back. Old Zhang didn't ask him if this number came from a dream, just said casually to Ah Wang:</p>
<p>"Ah Wang, add another stroke to your diary, one seven six three eight zero."</p>
<p>Scissors-shaped Chinese Economy</p>
<p>Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>In economics, there is a special commentary on the current economic development of society, namely the "scissors shape." The so-called "scissors shape" means that the capital on which social wealth is based has an odd trend, with all production focusing on industrial development, creating urban prosperity and exhausting rural financial resources, causing them to fall into long-term poverty. Cities and villages, one large and one small, one thriving and one declining, have become a morbid phenomenon of the present social economy.</p>
<p>China has been "established on agriculture" since ancient times. Although cities are now so developed and rural areas are so bankrupt, economic development has long become "scissors." However, China has "special national conditions," so the iron laws of economic development in other countries, when reflected in China, become different. According to recent reports, in the midst of "the decline of all industries," each bank had a large surplus in business last year, and the Central Bank even reached a huge sum of one million several hundred thousand yuan. Readers who generally hope that the national economy of our country will be developed simply may think that the world is experiencing an economic crisis, with exchange bankruptcies and bank closures. At present, the banks in our country are standing out, business is booming, and we should celebrate the development of the future of our national capital. But when I read it, I feel "unable to cry or laugh" and "not knowing whether to laugh or cry"!</p>
<p>The common example of economic development is that the prosperity of industrial production first causes the concentration of finances and the development of bank capital. Last year, in the midst of "the decline of all industries," banking business alone could prosper. This is not a symbol of the advancement of our national capital, but a conscious awareness of it becoming "worse every day." Last year, the "National Goods Year" was used to call for the prosperity of Chinese industry, but imperialism, under the coercion of the economic crisis, regarded China as the end of commodity sales, implementing its "probing and annexing" massive dumping as much as possible, which instead caused great blows to Chinese industry. The largest industries, such as the spinning and silk reeling industries, had shutdowns of eight or nine out of ten. At this time of "decline" of Chinese national industry, surplus capital was transferred to various non-productive speculative businesses. This is the main reason why banking business was uniquely prosperous last year. At the same time, due to the extreme increase in internal and external troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters in the interior, all the cash from rural areas was rushed to the cities and entered the savings vaults of the banks.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called "scissors shape" that represents the imbalance of economic development between cities and villages in China is even more unbalanced by the "scissors shape" of industrial decline and the prosperity of non-productive capital speculative businesses in banks. The fact that banking business did not focus on industrial investment last year but instead focused on speculation in urban land construction insurance trusts has become a feature of the decline of Chinese national industry, the surge of foreign commodities, and increasing colonization. Bank capital and industrial investment have become the "scissors shape" of our country's economy!</p>
<p>However, recently the "Women's National Goods Year" has been advocated again. Whether this general stimulant can bring the "scissors-shaped" Chinese economy back to life is like the "Women's National Goods Year," which can only help a small number of luxurious women become more inclined to foreign goods, sharing the same fate. China's national industry may not be rescued by any "Women's National Goods Year" or "Children's Year," but should start from the elimination of the "scissors shape" development of the Chinese economy. However, it is also closely related to the problem of eliminating the "scissors shape" in China's international relations, eliminating our speculation in politics, and truly engaging in political independence and industrial revitalization.</p>
<p>Women's National Goods Year?</p>
<p>Hu</p>
<p>In this year, people seem to have arranged the things to be done this year. The most eye-catching are: Women's National Goods Year, Children's Year, the Second Year of Bandit Suppression... Arranging the things to be done this year at the beginning of the year can also show the spirit of the Chinese in doing things, at least it can wash away those shameful and humiliating ridicules of the Chinese as "unorganized," "unplanned," and "five-minute enthusiasm"!</p>
<p>Although it is said that way, however, there are all kinds of human affairs, and a little laziness can lead to a hundred years of regret. If you allow us to examine and allow us to point out freely, then please look at this disappointing sentence: "Idle people like to create new patterns, but it is just creating new patterns."</p>
<p>Last year was a year that everyone called "National Goods Year." Newspapers promoted it, celebrities encouraged it, but the customs statistics bluntly told us that the import surplus in the "National Goods Year" reached a huge sum of 90 million yuan, even greater than the import surplus in the previous year (which should be called the Non-National Goods Year!). With such a large import surplus, there are even more foreign goods, which needs no further explanation. There is also a fact: domestic silk mills, yarn mills, flour mills, and noodle factories in the "National Goods Year" mostly depended on foreign silk yarn, flour, and noodles. No one cared about the domestic silk yarn, and the domestic rice and grains were piled up in ruins. In some places, silk yarn merchants stopped working; in some places, the surplus rice and grains were pushed into the wilderness, waved their tears, and burned them. All these heartbreaking facts are what we saw and heard in this so-called "National Goods Year." These facts are also well known and understood by everyone.</p>
<p>For a year, the merchants in Shanghai who promoted national goods also hung up signs for national goods. However, the actual market was filled with foreign goods. Foreigners returned to their home countries for the New Year with their big bellies and triumphant expressions. What was left behind was the Chinese indigenous merchants being cold and lonely, with frowning eyebrows and sighs. And this "National Goods Year" with signs hanging passed away in this coldness and loneliness, in this frowning and sighing. Looking back on this year, how can we not feel the pain!</p>
<p>Now comes another Women's National Goods Year, asking wives and young ladies to participate in grand celebrations, riding in cars for parades along the streets. This new trick, decorating the first day of the New Year, yet I don't know how much effort it will cost those enthusiastic promoters. However, in this grand celebration, I feel that they are not very sincere in promoting national goods. They want to ride in fashionable cars, and they still wear high-heeled leather shoes. They don't like to ride rickshaws, and they don't like to wear Chinese-style shoes. This shows a big flaw. They may not be promoting national goods for the sake of promoting national goods, and promoting national goods may not be out of some patriotic enthusiasm from the depths of their hearts, but they are too idle, having nothing to do, so they come up with new ideas and create new patterns!</p>
<p>This is not slander. Asking noble modern grandmothers and girls not to use foreign goods is a "New Year's dream." Promoting national goods without promoting a transformation and reform movement of national goods among the producing masses, but instead promoting it among these noble women who specialize in consuming foreign goods, is putting the cart before the horse, the most foolish method! If anyone thinks these words are too extreme, then the foreign goods displayed in the major companies and various large and small foreign goods stores in Shanghai would not be patronized by Chinese women. To take a step back, the women who are enthusiastically calling for "Women's National Goods Year" today would not set foot in foreign goods stores this year, not wear foreign clothes, not wear foreign hats, not wear foreign shoes and boots. Only then would it be considered a contribution and effect of promoting "Women's National Goods Year," and only then could it prove that the above words are too extreme.</p>
<p>I won't say anything else. We predict that the Women's National Goods Year will disappear silently like last year's National Goods Year. Those who are determined to save the country should not place their hopes on that empty event, nor should they live in an empty life. They should grasp the actual work. For example, to promote national goods, they should go deep into the vast masses and unite with those villagers to manufacture national goods, improve national goods, and improve labor productivity and consumption power. By taking such practical and solid actions, the national goods movement can eventually become widespread and sustainable. Okay, now that a sign of Women's National Goods Year is hung up, everyone's heart should secretly hide a National Goods Saves Women Year, and put more effort into this year!</p>

<p>Much Ado About Nothing</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We have a difficult problem and sincerely request your explanation. Huaiqin is twenty-two years old, his father passed away early, and he has an older brother. Huaiqin has been working in the gold industry for many years. He has been friends with his neighbor, Xiao Lvyun, since childhood. She is twenty-one years old this year and her father has passed away. Her family is well-off, and her mother loves her like a treasure. In recent years, our friendship has deepened, and we have secretly committed to being lifelong partners. We sought the perfect consent from Lvyun's mother, and Huaiqin's mother usually loves Lvyun very much. In this way, our union would not have caused problems, but later someone tried to sabotage it, spreading rumors in front of our two mothers, causing a big storm between the two elders. Alas! Unexpectedly, neighbors for decades, and about to become in-laws, immediately became enemies. The villains who sabotage us are truly hateful. But Lvyun's mother later realized that the villains were doing evil inside, and both sides had misunderstandings, and hoped that we could succeed, but Huaiqin's mother was stubborn and showed no remorse. Instead, she listened to the villains and arranged for Huaiqin to marry a girl with a certain surname in October of the old year, first performing the ceremony of "presenting the red" (an old custom of pre-ordering a wedding). This spring, she is forcing Huaiqin to return home for the engagement. At that time, she used coercive means to oppress him, and Huaiqin could not resist. We secretly made a vow to rather sacrifice everything than separate, but we are both ignorant and uneducated. How can we fight to the end and achieve final victory!</p>
<p>We wish you a bright future</p>
<p>Difficult people Zhou Huaiqin and Xiao Lvyun bow together</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>Zhou and Xiao's love is so firm that it is truly worthy of our admiration. After receiving your letter, we considered it for a long time: how can we work towards a satisfactory ending for the two of you, while not making either of your parents unhappy, and causing a tragedy within the family. Because if we simply enable the two of you to achieve the purpose of uniting, the problem is very simple, because marriage should originally be decided by the wishes of both parties themselves. Parents can participate in the opinions, and should, but the decision should also be completely autonomous by both parties. Moreover, the two of you are adults, so there is no problem. What we are most worried about is that in this era of great changes in family organization, parents still follow traditional ideas and are still dictatorial about their children's marriages. Now, if children suddenly decide their own marriages, and it is a marriage that their parents do not approve of, wouldn't it be a great act of disobedience and unfilial piety in their eyes? Therefore, after repeated consideration, we believe that your union is best not to overly violate your kind parents, but in case the purpose cannot be achieved, you must still stick to your original intention and maintain the attitude of "rather sacrifice everything than separate," and may as well marry automatically. As for the method of proceeding, we believe it is: First, Huaiqin can explain to his mother the previous misunderstandings between the two parties and firmly express his intention to marry Ms. Xiao. (This is best done through someone else's mediation to avoid direct conflict.) In this way, the old woman loves her son deeply and may be willing to sacrifice her prejudices. If this method cannot be done, then we believe that the two of you should announce your marriage, and Huaiqin should cancel his previous engagement without saying anything else. However, this is the most undesirable method, and it is best to avoid it. Huaiqin made a big mistake before, that is, you are now engaged to someone else, because in this way your mother will not allow you to unite with Ms. Lvyun (because she will never be willing to cancel the marriage that she has arranged) and canceling the engagement in the old society is a very difficult thing. Huaiqin should have strongly opposed it when he was supposed to be engaged this spring, and it is a bit late now. Moreover, it can be seen from this that you are still inevitably succumbing to the environment, and the current environment is worse than before, making it more difficult to overcome. Therefore, we hope that before you fight, you should first assess whether you are truly determined. If you are, then go fight, otherwise victory will not be achieved, but it will leave a deep rift between mother and son for life, so why bother. In short, success depends on human effort. When you start asking your mother, your attitude must be calm and sincere, and you must not be too hasty, otherwise there will be no room for maneuver. Fortunately, your will is so firm, so there is nothing to fear, because you have no failure or failure to achieve your goal. The reason why you want to get your mother's consent is nothing more than not wanting to cause a tragedy in ethics. As for the power of union, it is completely in your own hands, not in your mother's hands - you must understand this - Our answer may seem too empty to you, but what we know about your situation is as simple as what is said in the letter, what more specific methods can we offer?</p>

<p>Novel "Prison Memoirs" (10)</p>
<p>Car Wheel</p>
<p>I pushed open the door of the Second Section. All the warden, clerks, were mostly silent, waiting for something about to happen, something to be resolved, because this was a place of peace and quiet. The prisoners were like cotton swabs, like little lambs. They were so free that they were afraid of smoking too much. In a place where any action would lead to a beating, who would dare to be stubborn? Therefore, when a small thing happened, all the prison staff focused their attention — at this time they were waiting for the victim who would be suppressed by them and made to look bad or suffer. I went in. So when I went in, everyone's eyes were on me.</p>
<p>The Chief of the Second Section stood up as if I had drawn him up. At first, he used his nearsighted glasses to get close to me, looking at the report, carefully studying how to extract words of counterattack from it. He probably read it no less than three or four times.</p>
<p>On each desk there was a lamp, a whole lamp — this phenomenon was very strange to me. Three years of habit had blurred the good impression of whole lamps in my mind, as if there were only half-lamps, half-lamps dimly lit like oil lamps. — Now, shining brightly before my eyes were nineteen lamps together. The whole office was like a lamp. It was almost a miracle to me.</p>
<p>I lived in a cell for three years (although I had switched several times, they were all similar). A small hole was dug at the top of the wall and a ten-odd light bulb was installed in the middle, sharing some of the light with the cell next door.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you?" — His face was serious, but seemed very soft under such bright light.</p>
<p>"I don't know what's wrong. The medical officer didn't tell me. My toes have been swollen for three or four months. Precisely because the medical officer has not specified what it is, I am even more terrified."</p>
<p>"You filed a report requesting that alcohol be issued, didn't you?" He said, suppressing his anger.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, because I have had more than ten injections for numbness and they haven't gotten better. I have eaten dozens of packages of medicine, but they are ineffective. The medical officer said that I can get better by drinking this kind of alcohol. So I asked my family to buy a bottle."</p>
<p>My words poured out, because I was also uncontrollably angry and depressed.</p>
<p>He, I could see that he had endured and endured again, slowly sat down, took my report to the table, and pointed at the report with his finger, saying - "Look - you said the clinic can't cure your illness, then are we using the clinic as a guise? A liar? You say, you say!"</p>
<p>"No, no,..." Before my "no" could be uttered, he continued to speak, and stood up with a raised throat, saying - "No, aren't you clearly saying the clinic is useless?"</p>
<p>At this time, I had absolutely no room to speak. His words and actions were very tense, not leaving me a minute to defend myself. He slapped me twice in the face.</p>

<p>A Letter from Australia</p>
<p>The War Between British and American Films (Part Two)</p>
<p>Yin Xi</p>
<p>"Here, the most admired American film star can be said to be George Arliss. His works, even if they are bad, can be shown here for many days. Perhaps the reason is because he is British, or his name is George, especially respected by the British. Younger stars, such as Clark Gable, still have a considerable position, but I can say that in Australia, no matter what star, there is no great appeal. Audiences watch the movies, not admire the stars. Many movie fans don't even remember the names of the actors. Strangely, Zasu Pitts is highly praised here. That can't be blamed on them either, because Zasu is a great artist on the screen. Her biggest disadvantage is that she played too many vulgar and funny roles before, but she will definitely get roles that suit her status soon.</p>
<p>"Because Ramon Novarro and I are old friends of many years, I worry about his future. In China, Japan, the Philippines, Java, and other places, I often used Ramon as a question, but I never got a good answer. They don't welcome him, saying he is too effeminate. This is very wrong, or perhaps it is because the movies he starred in, when they came to the East, made them feel that way. It's very strange, especially soccer movies, and Ramon was not the right material for soccer movies either. (The translator here feels that what Mr. Carr says is not entirely true. I know that many Chinese people welcome Ramon Novarro, especially ladies and young women, perhaps because he is close to being effeminate.)</p>
<p>"Now Australians are also starting to make their own films. There are already two film companies here starting to work. But they are in a difficult situation, the authorities cannot take the overall situation into account, and the harsh censorship causes them endless pain. Recently, they wanted to shoot an adventure movie, like the movies we make with Native Americans, but they used black people instead of Native Americans. This movie was half-shot when it was banned by the government, saying that the content of the movie did not match the local facts. That company went bankrupt and closed down, and the shareholders lost all their capital.</p>
<p>"One thing is worth recording. In the past, theaters that specialized in showing newsreels have been tried in Los Angeles and other places, but they all failed. But in Sydney, there is a theater that specializes in showing newsreels, and business is very good. The audience likes to watch newsreels very much, and they often find it interesting to watch old news from a few months ago.</p>
<p>"Today, two promising young people, one male and one female, took a boat to Hollywood. Paramount launched a beauty contest here, and they are the champions elected at that meeting. The woman is a young lady from a famous family here, only nineteen years old. She can speak seven languages and can ride horses, swim, etc. The Paramount staff stationed here thought this was a rare talent, but when she got to Hollywood, she understood that when she shed tears, only one language was enough. The man is a young lawyer. I don't know how beautiful he is, but his name, 'Brian Norman', is very moving. (End)"</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<p>Review of "Silver Dollar"</p>
<p>Wang Fei</p>
<p>"Yes, I don't want to single out the technology of 'Silver Dollar' as 'worthy of our high evaluation'. Because I always believe that form is determined by content, and for established art, it should be critically accepted. So here I solemnly declare that the form and content of 'Silver Dollar' are equally bad, although the myriad forms of Western movies have overwhelmed many 'critics' now.</p>
<p>High speed is the characteristic of the new century, but the new film art must first meet the conditions of clarity. The development of 'Silver Dollar' is quite fast, but because of the lack of clarity, we cannot but make 'Silver Dollar' also show no new trends in form. And we cannot abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, and only point out that the director's handling is not good. We have to understand this content — the story itself is like this.</p>
<p>The creation of new art (especially movies) must pay attention to its 'simplicity'. The so-called 'simplicity' means that in the writer's creation method, dealing with the theme is to find its 'simplicity' from the complex chaos. In the presentation aspect, it is to hold tightly to that theme. Only in this way can the writer express reality, not phenomena, and what the audience understands is the essence, not fleeting images. The main reason for the failure of 'Silver Dollar' is its lack of 'simplicity'.</p>
<p>'Silver Dollar' expresses a tragedy when the silver standard was abolished in 1860, the story of a person who rose because of the determination of the silver standard and went bankrupt because of the abolition of the silver standard. Although this is a historical event, it is not accidental to bring it up again at present. The eternal economic crisis is deepening. In European and American countries that have adopted the gold standard, the gold standard has been abandoned. The golden America has the attempt to force various countries (especially France) to abandon the gold standard, and the call for abandoning the gold standard in its own country is also constantly rising. In this situation, they naturally consider the monetary system after abandoning the gold standard. The first thing that comes to mind is naturally the silver standard. Therefore, the events when the silver standard was abolished were brought up again. So, the production of this 'Silver Dollar' was definitely stimulated by the turbulence of the gold standard.</p>
<p>This subject matter cannot be said to be bad. But because the creators lack 'simplicity' in their creative methods, this important idea is instead blurred by irrelevant things. Moreover, because of the creators' own emotional relationship, this 'Silver Dollar' has</p>
<h3 id="e45">Reflections on the Pacification of the Fujian Incident and the Mission of the Fourth Plenary Session - Shao Yuanchong's Report at the National Government Memorial Weekly Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, delivered a report at the National Government Memorial Weekly Meeting on the 15th, entitled "Reflections on the Pacification of the Fujian Incident and the Mission of the Fourth Plenary Session." The original text stated approximately: Regarding the recovery of Fuzhou, although there are still matters such as local rehabilitation and people's relief to be handled, the resolution of the military rebellion can be declared to have come to a conclusion. The chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government has already been appointed, and there is also a center of gravity in the political aspect. The reason why this Fujian Incident was resolved in a very short period of time is certainly due to the hard work and unity of comrades in the Central Army, Navy, and Air Force. At the same time, it also gave us a lesson, that is, no matter whether a group or an individual does things, they must never violate public opinion and abandon their own history. When this Fujian rebellion occurred, social public opinion absolutely did not agree with it. This powerful expression of public opinion gave them a great blow and was also an important reason for reducing the strength and shaking the foundation of the rebellion. At the same time, the leaders of the rebellion and the military force they used were all trained and cultivated by our party. Now the rebels suddenly don't want the party, don't want the Republic of China, don't want the Blue Sky White Sun flag, and even search for and tear up the Premier's portrait from various places, which is to completely abandon and overthrow their own history, and completely eradicate their own foundation. Although this kind of baseless force concocts various strange slogans and claims to express their doctrine, in fact, they are completely speaking with one voice with the Communist Party, and of course they cannot gain everyone's faith. This is also a major reason for the failure of the rebel forces. Moreover, the behavior of this rebellion was really too bizarre and absurd. They even wanted to fundamentally build a country and change the era name. In fact, how easy is it to correct the calendar? How can it be done sloppily? This shows their lack of knowledge and their childish disease of being fond of chaos and reckless action. Therefore, from the lesson of the Central Government's elimination of the Fujian Incident and the experience of eliminating the forces of rebellion against the country and the party in the country, it is very clear to tell us that any military force cultivated by the party, if it wants to rebel against the party and the country, there is absolutely no reason to survive. This is the biggest feeling that this Fujian Incident gives us. Secondly, the holding of the Fourth Plenary Session is originally a routine matter. According to the central regulations, the Central Plenary Session is held every six months. This Fourth Plenary Session was originally scheduled to be held last year, but due to various other reasons, it was changed to be held on January 20. When the meeting is held, it will only report on the past measures of the party and government, and discuss the plans for implementation in the future. It is originally very ordinary and very common. However, at the time of the current serious national crisis, it is hoped that the party and the government can obtain many better-implemented plans. Therefore, this plenary session will of course have more precise discussions on how China, which is under the attack of internal and external troubles, can find a way out and how it can obtain the survival of the nation. China's current situation, of course, anyone feels very serious, and looking at the international situation in Europe and the United States, all countries are striving to enrich their military preparations, and their attention is unanimously focused on the Pacific issue. The so-called Pacific issue is also the issue of China. We ourselves are at the forefront. If we do not have the ability to protect and defend ourselves, decide the fate of the country, and find a way out, China will always be sacrificed and dominated in the future. The future is really unimaginable. We should prepare ourselves urgently in this international situation where dangers are rampant. Long-term preparations are not allowed by the current material resources, financial resources, and human resources, and cannot be done in a short period of time. But at the very least, we should prepare the power to protect ourselves, and under necessary and possible circumstances, concentrate human, financial, and material resources to make a necessary and possible preparation. At the same time, we know that the establishment of the foundation of a country and the cultivation of national power, the construction of material aspects, are of course important, and the spiritual aspect is also equally important. China is now of course poor and exhausted, and seems to be at a loss, but we firmly believe that if we can develop the spirit of struggle and hard work inherent in our nation, there is definitely no way to fail to establish the foundation of the country. There is no way. The reason why China's national power has not been established in the past few years is still due to the mutual restraint, friction, and damage of domestic forces. Therefore, we must make our limited human and financial resources not wasted, not lost, not restrained, and concentrated on striving to maintain the foundation of national survival. We believe that this basic policy can definitely be decided satisfactorily at this plenary session. We can also see that in this plenary session, we can fully express the sincerity and unity of the party's cadres and comrades, so that the various past discords can come to an end, and will not happen again in the future. Everyone will concentrate their energy and strive for national survival. Politically, we know how to make it simple and agile, and to express effectiveness in practice. Internationally, we know how to concentrate human and financial resources to make the minimum preparation. Especially in the lives of the people, we know how to relieve the suffering of the people and increase the welfare of the people. This is the hope of all comrades and the people of the country, and it is also the responsibility of this party meeting.
