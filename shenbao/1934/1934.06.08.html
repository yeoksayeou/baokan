<p>時評</p>
<h3>關係國防之引水權亟應保持！</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>嘗考中外約章中。引水二字首見於道光二十三年（一八四三）中英　口通商章程第一條。而外人自雇引水。則由道光二十七年（一八四七、中國瑞典那威條約第八欵開其先例。其後咸豐八年（一八五八）中美條約第十七欵。中英續約第卅五欵。亦作同樣規定。以示利益均霑之意。而同年中法條約第十五欵。且更進一步。謂「凡人欲當大法國引水者。若有三張船主執照。領事官便可着伊爲引水」云云。同治五年（一八六六）中義條約第三十四欵。又授各國領事官以會同訂立引水規條之權。其餘各締約國分别引用最惠國待遇條文。遂亦一般有所藉口。</p>
<p>外人把持引水權之條約根據。不外如有所述。然實際上攫取我國引水權造成喧賓奪主之局面者。尙以同治六年（一八六七）總務司赫德所訂之引水章程爲厲　。赫德章程旣將引水權公關於各締約國人民（第二欵）。復興各國領事官以擬定各口引水分章，引水界限，引水名額，及引水各費之權（第一欵）。引水之考選。歸於海關所屬之理船廳辦理（第三欵）。而理船廳之一切實權則操諸外籍巡工司之乎。各條約國領事及外籍引水董事。皆得幫辦考選事宜（第三欵）。而各締約國領事且有從旁監考之權（第四欵）。凡已領有字據之外籍引水。皆得各帶學徒一名（第六欵）。從事練習。使該項太阿倒持之畸形制度。得以師徒相傳永襲而罔替焉。</p>
<p>日來上海市商會。中國商船駕駛總會。中國引水公會籌備會。航業同業公會等團體。爲力爭引水權一事。大聲疾呼。函電紛馳。領水權之保持。有關於吾國國防大計。在茲外侮日亟之會。市商等之呼籲。誠不容等閒視之也。</p>
<p>引水一名領港。日本譯爲水先人。以領導船舶出入某一港口爲專職。故任何引水對於一港之航路水道港章條文。皆須完全明瞭。蓋所以保行船之安全。責至重也。惟引水旣須熟諳港内之形勢險要。爲鞏固國防計。自不能不由本國人民充當。各國法律莫不有類似「非本國人絶對不能從事引水」之規定。獨我國之引水權。隨内河航行權而俱失。一旦發生國際戰禍。乃不免大受其累。如前淸光緒十二年（一八八六）中法之戰。法艦僱用我國海關頒給領照之美人爲引水。深入閩口。使我艦船多艘。被轟沉沒。無辜人民。死亡枕藉。又如一二八之變。日艦出入淞滬港口。輸兵運械。亦皆僱用我國海關頒給領照之日人引水爲之嚮導。及今回思。猶有餘痛。</p>
<p>民國二十年三月五日。國府考試院公布引水考試條例。第一條云。「非依有本條例規定領有考試院引水執照者。不得爲引水人。」而第二條復規定應引水人考試者。須爲中華民國人民。可見當局對於引水權之收回。已具决心。凡我國人。寗不樂觀厥成。去年九月間。經參謀本部之提倡。國府復頒布引水管理暫行章程四十六條。其關於上海引水事務者。卽組引水管理委員會管轄之。一時雷厲風行。尤見政府維護國權之至意。</p>
<p>外籍引水。向以上海天津兩處爲盤踞之中心。暫行章程頒布後。兩處領團必至提出異議。而其所持理由。又必不外乎搬弄條約辭句及赫德章程。早爲吾人意料所及。果也。上海領袖領事克寗瀚迭函市政府。提出交涉。一則云。「同治七年引水章程。乃中國與某某各國雙方訂定辦法之結果。而非中國單獨行動所頒布。」再則云。「現時引水權乃以條約爲根據。如有何變更影響各國人民之處。非得彼方締約者同意。則各敝同僚莫能承認。」然不知赫德一中國官吏耳。其所擬訂之章程。旣經前淸總理衙門核准而後公布。實具國内法令之性質。以後令更改前令。固無非議之餘地。至赫德有無以個人資格與某某等國商洽。乃一枝節問題。殊無關於宏旨。總理衙門於頒布章程後。縱有照會通知各國公使。亦僅係尋常辦事之手續。斷不能强指爲有國際恊定之意味也。至於前淸政府與英美等國訂結條約。關於引水一事之含義。亦「僅爲外船進出通商五口。得僱用引水人無阻。其與法國所訂條文中。並謂有三張船主執照領事官便可着伊爲引水等語。不過備爲無從僱用引水時。得憑此標凖選用引水人。所有訂約條文。均限於外船便於僱用引水人範圍。但對於我政府管理引水人。事屬法規。並無明定何項專條。得由外人參與立法之事」也。（語見本年四月四日海軍部咨上海市政府文）</p>
<p>由此觀之。我國對於整個引水權之收回。無論衡情度理都無徘徊觀望之必要。而况章程已頒。威信攸關。更何能因外力壓迫。遽爾改變初衷。友邦人士。如能撇開條約章程。平心靜氣。略一顧及本國尊重引水主權之事實。便知六七十年來中國所受之痛苦爲何如。已所不欲。勿施於人。深願友邦人士。體念及此。若謂引水權之放棄。不能在内河航行權之前。則適足堅我收回内河航行權之心而已。借爲把持引水權之藉口。殊嫌不充分也。</p>

<h3>報界工會宣言　爲援助英美烟廠罷工工友</h3>
<p>全國同胞們、越是戴着文明的假面具的人、他的舉動越是野蠻得不講理、尤其是英帝國主義者、我們更可聯想到民國十四年的五卅慘案、不是他們要想獻媚於日本資本家、那裏會慘殺我們許多無辜的同胞、當時我們也曾消極的抵抗着、實行「抵制仇貨」、但是五分鐘的熱度早已化爲烏有了、然而他們的各種侵略的方法、較之從前更有顯著的進步、我們來看一看、現在英美烟公司的資本家、是何等的强橫啊、他們藉着治外法權爲護身符、把中國官廳的命令束之高閣把三千餘代替他們生産的工友羣衆、很輕飄地藉口「營業不振、工人不受指揮」、於五月十二日突然宣佈停廠、而置一班有功於公司的工人於死地、誰都知道、英美烟公司的盈餘、其數字大得驚人、那末他們理應對於以汗血爲他們生産的工人、加以優待的了、然而事實却適得其反、當然、我們並不夢想他們「强盜發善心」、不過希望他們維持原有狀况、使一班勞苦工人、可以藉此生活罷了、至於工人不受指揮、那更其是笑話、如果確有其事、亦儘可訴之於中國官廳、而中國官廳是有其應付的方法、但是公司當局却計不出此、竟突然以高壓手段來對付我們一班智識淺薄呼號無門的勞苦工人、不惜破壞兩國人民的親善、並僱用大批武裝探捕毆傷我十餘個手無寸鐵的無辜工友、我們現在直截痛快地說一句、英美烟公司資本家的用意、並不是營業不振、更</p>
<p>不是工人不受指揮、乃是英美公司當局蓄意破壞我國工運、及嫌一班原有工人工資太大、而欲掉換另一班工人、任其宰割、以飽其經濟侵略的私慾罷了、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論生活的矛盾　丨丨答李靑·何國芬，羅光濤諸君一，　問題的提起</h3>
<p>這一問題首先是由李君提出的、後來又接到何羅二君的來信、都很嚴肅的要求對這一問題作科學的理解、何君說：「這雖然是一個極平常的問題、却是靑年一致的要求要理解的，因爲現代中國靑年的生活是太矛盾了、儒者在矛盾中苦惱、徬徨、勇者或昂着頭不顧一切爲他的目標而邁進了、或相反的痛痛快快的自殺了。」不錯，這確是一個被人遺忘了的嚴肅的問題，需要有科學的處理。現在將李君等提出的疑問、先爲揭出於後：</p>
<p>一、生活的矛盾是否是一種病態，出了生活常軌的變態？</p>
<p>二·如何去說明一個人的思想與行動的矛盾，思想與思想的矛盾，行動與行動的矛盾？　　三·怎樣克服行爲上的矛盾？</p>
<p>二·生活上的矛盾現象是受生活過程本身的矛盾性快定的。</p>
<p>羅君深自痛責自己生活的矛盾，極力推尊，欽羨沒有矛盾的生活，他希望他的生活能像一池秋水一樣，完全消滅矛盾。不用說他是否認一種合理的生活會有矛盾存在的。羅君舉出許多古聖今賢來，證明偉大人格的人的生活是完全沒有矛盾的？有矛盾的生活祇是平凡人的生活。這些話是否完全正確呢？自然是不正確。因爲羅君把生活看得太簡單抽象了。忽略了生活過程的本身就是矛盾鬥爭的過程，生活不過是矛盾的延續，行爲上表現出的矛盾現象不過是說明了生活本身的矛盾鬥爭，這裏一點不關乎人之　否，一點沒有神秘存乎其間。</p>
<p>但是，羅君這種錯誤的根源是在什麽地方呢？這無疑的是由於下面的原因。因爲社會上很輕視一個人生活上的矛盾現象，拿矛盾來作秤量或攻擊人的工具，因此，社會上祇有心直口快像李·何·羅君這樣的人續肯自白自己生活的矛盾，其他的人是不肯輕於承認的，有一種人要等到自己的矛盾被别人察覺後，他纔紅着臉皮，半呑半吐的在羞怯中勉强的承認了，有一種人，裝着「道貎岸然」·「凛然不可侵犯」之槪，自謂自己一生無矛盾。其實，這都是社會的虚僞，人的生活過程旣是矛盾的鬥爭過程，沒有矛盾可說就是沒有生活。平常人總容易幻想出一個偉大人物一切都與凡人不同，這完全是誤解的，他忽略了旣是人必然有人的共通性，同時亦有其獨特性。中國有一名古話，說，「英雄常見亦常人」這道出了其中的眞理。因爲英雄本來是人，他雖有出人處，他亦應有凡人的一般性質。不然，他就全變爲超人了。我們如果打破了這種觀念，我們生活上的矛盾姑無論它是行爲表面上的，或「内心」的，我們都無用秘密，也不必認爲可恥的事。它並不是生活的病態，也沒出乎生活的常軌，它剛剛是生活過程上很平常的現象。（未完）</p>

<p>吾人仍有爲該記者告者、卽吾人所知、乃國權高於一切、此外任何均不足相提並論、更何有於外國輪船公司、若論上海進出口船舶噸位、幸而中</p>
<p>國尙有六百萬噸否則假設中國若無輪船進出、充記者之意、豈不連黃浦江都要讓渡給外人乎、該刋記者又以將來中國如果收回引水、外船將在吳淞停泊來恐嚇、此可見該記者之缺乏常識、蓋天下事只有前進爲正常、開倒車卽是反常、上海碼頭已經開發到如此地步、大槪只有該刋記者才有此種見識、來奉勸他們舍此就彼呢、</p>
<p>復次、爲該刋對於中國引水人之潑駡、該刋口口聲聲、認定中國引水人並未具有外籍引水學員最少之程度吾人初不知有何根據、卽其所論之駕駛航藝等等、更屬皮相、只可用來騙騙外行罷了、故吾人所欲爲各國各界正告者、則吾人站在引水人的地位、對於該刋「地方知識與指約法」之批評、極願承受、因吾人認定引水人之職務所要求者、正爲熟悉當地一切情形、（如水深·潮流·風向影響等等、）並輔以相當之駛船弄船經騐卽已足事、此外均屬欺人之談、蓋當船隻入港以後、連普通航海上最簡單之Ｂｅａｌｉｎｇ也用不着、其唯一的駕駛方法、卽是指約法、卽船頭對那裏、船尾對那裏、已經十分足用、比如進吳淞口時、船頭須向吳淞燈塔、並須與塔前燈標取齊、則最少水深爲三十英尺、又如在陳家嘴附近夜中進口則在駛近陳家嘴對面燈標時、一方須俟東溝北邊燈光全露、卽可換針向河道中心駛去、便得最深之水量、其他類似此者、不勝枚舉、亦不必枚舉、如此方法、當是指約法、吾人未與外籍引水接觸、不知伊等究竟比我們高明多少、該刋記者若不吝賜敎、則吾人至所歡迎、</p>
<p>最後、吾入得有一種風傳的消息、是去年中國某埠曾考試引水、有一位中國人去考、考罷成績甚優、於是某國人監考人、提起抗議、强要重複考問此人、那時主席就說、何以考時不問、而必俟考罷再問、這是不公平、不可以的、於是某國人就提出了中國人沒有駕駛及航藝的本領來詰難、豈知當塲激怒了引水會的經理、對着某國人說、引水只要有一切本地的知識、及弄船的本領足矣、其餘都是說說的、我們大不顚人的駕駛航藝算好了、一樣的打碎船、一樣的沉沒船的、想貴國人亦同是如此的、得了罷他　的駕駛和航藝、假使道種傳說爲可靠的話、則該刋記者可以休矣、也許水手們的頭腦、究竟簡單、在不平的塲所、會有正義和眞實的話說出來、比不得假斯文僞君子們、左聖經而右屠刀、要殺人還要諉之替天行道呢、</p>
<p>最後、吾人仍不得不有所喋喋、卽現在英國很有幾個重要的口岸、如利物浦等處、船隻進出之多、港内水道之擁擠、較之上海港猶有過之、而其引水人之資格、反不必定須曾實任船長者、此係事實、該記者爲英人、豈不知本國之事、何以於論文中不一及之、豈非欲以危詞　聽售其奸詐乎、吾人亦知此種事實、一經道穿、使索然寡味、然吾人爲血濃於水丨Ｂｌｏｏｄ　ｉｓ　ｔｈｉｃｋ　ｔｈａｎｗａｔｅｒ丨的關係、不得不向該刋記者表示歡忱、而　此種種直言而已、（完）</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>九音鑼的名稱的由來便是因爲它那九面小銅鑼所發出來的聽音是各個不同的；而我之所以特别贊美它的緣故，乃是因爲它的音韵非常的甜潤，且又特别的動聽。演奏的時候是用一根很細的木棒輕輕地叩着、這木棒的頭上，有一顆硬木製的圓球、像算盤子一樣大小、却因它的木質極硬，所以發出來的聲音便格外的淸越。</p>
<p>九音鑼所發出的九種不同的聲音便是中國古代樂譜中實在應用的九個音諧，正和現在所用的一二三四五六七無異。它們是工·四·上·尺·五·一·六·萬·合·九個字。究竟這九個字是怎樣會選入樂譜中來的？它們所含蓄的意義又是什麽？那可不是我所能答復的了，除我之外，也許有大多數人是回答不出來的；原因是由來已久，大家只知學着老調唱，誰也不耐煩再去尋根究底了。</p>
<p>其次是笙。笙在中國樂器中好算是最古，又最奇特的一種。它的形狀像一個佛手，一起有二十四根細竹管，每根的長度是各不相同的，但是旁邊都有小孔開着。人在下面一個像車柄似的東西上吹着，同時又用手指把這些小孔一撳一放，便和九音鑼一般也有各各不同的聲音發出來，而這些聲音也都是和上面所說的九個音階相符合的。不過因爲所用的竹管太細，聲音總不能十分高，而吹的人倒是非常的費力。（五二）</p>
<h3>王老八</h3>
<p>— 余文</p>
<p>一二八前，王老八這老頭兒，每隔三兩天總得上我這裏來拿衣去洗的。滬戰後，我搬了家，這老頭兒就沒見面了。</p>
<p>提起這王老八，到有令人佩服的地方。他年輕的當兒，是一個海輪上的水手，曾經到過歐美各國，能說上一口流利的英國話。爲人很和氣，做事很勤懇，年紀雖大，却不賣老，有人呌他老王八，他也不和人家計較。他雖到過外國，會說外國話，但，他並不在人面前炫耀，要是他瞧見有外國巡捕無故欺人，吃醉酒的外國水兵任意打人的事，他是要出而干涉，和他們論理的。他不穿西裝，不開口說洋話，不愛洋派，不愛用外國貨。他穿的是土布衫，用的是中國貨。</p>
<p>老王八人雖好，養兩個兒子却不肖丨都是販賣日貨的！恐怕都是爲雜了種的關係吧？原來老王八的老婆是當年從英國帶來的洋婆子。</p>
<p>前天，在路上遇着了多時不見的老王八，分手後，才知道他的那位外國貨老婆已死，他的兩個雜種，一二八後仍做他們的日貨生意，老王八屢勸不聽，現下已和他們分居了。</p>
<p>後來，我想老王八這人着實要得，現在一般愛用洋貨的摩登男女都不如他哩！可是當我想到老王八的兒子仍在做奸商時，不由得連駡了兩聲「狗雜種」！</p>
<h3>訪馬</h3>
<p>— 伯樂之友</p>
<p>在上月十八，本欄人物小誌中登着一篇恂子君的「記一位人才」，内中是記的一位東京帝大留學生，因恐回國後無人請敎，因此，他不願回國，只在日本永遠做他的「老生」生涯。（老生者，老留學生之簡稱也）。他研究過化學，他也研究過藥物學，他又研究過生物學；他能自製化妝品，以作生活上的補助。</p>
<p>作者在該文中，把此種畸形狀態，歸咎於國家社會，認爲「良馬不逢伯樂」之感！其實，社會上也正有不少伯樂，在訪尋良馬呢！</p>
<p>現在有一位國貨界的名人，爲了看到這篇文字，對於這位懷才不遇的良馬，發生無限的同情，他意欲尋求這一匹良馬，使他能發展千里之才。</p>
<p>可是，爲了恂子君並未將他那朋友的姓名地址寫出來，那麽，這位伯樂先生，惟有執鞭而高呼曰「矯矯良馬，遠在天涯，極目扶桑，何處可求」？馬乎馬乎？其歸矣乎？</p>
<p>未了，希望該文作者恂子君見此報後，將某君通訊處示知，以便轉告伯樂先生，俾伯樂得馬，馬逢伯樂，豈不妙哉！（通訊處上海山海關路仁濟里四十五號朱惺公）</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十回　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　彈穿勁灑血染孤城</p>
<p>自己雖是不作聲，但是他也有很大的理會，好像有人在冥冥之中，告訴他說戰爭來了，戰爭要來的先兆，便是這樣的。由這裏更推想下去，戰爭的將來是些什麽，也就可想而知。但是自强正這樣出神，覺得有一陣凉風，由嘴角邊吹過。這一陣風，算是給予了他一種很大的警告，他跟着提起來了，剛才和營長歃血爲盟，精忠報國，現在口血未乾，又想到了戰事可怕。當軍人的人，打杖是當然的職務，有什麽可怕，這猶之乎航空的人駕飛機一樣，能說駕飛機是可怕的嗎？他如此想着，挺起胸來，將精神振作了一番，回了他的連部，依然作他的平常功課。這一晚無事。到了次日，上過早操，講過了功課，大家也好像無事，在十一點鐘，弟兄們三三五五，各拿着一塊雜和麫作的窩頭，蹲在地上午餐。就在這個時候，一陣嗡嗡的響聲，在頭頂上發生着。各位弟兄都是久經戰事的，聽了這種聲音如何不明白，分明是敵人的飛機到了。因之各人手上拿了窩頭向嘴裏送，還是不免側了耳朶聽，這個響聲的所在地。好在弟兄們中間，都有排班長從中監督着的，看了這副情形，立刻喝着道：吃飯吃飯，聽些什麽。聽是這副情形，不聽也是這副情形，吃飽了我們還要幹我們的正事吃罷。長官這樣的說着，兵士們也就低頭只管是吃。可就是在這個時候，震天震地的一下響，有一個炸彈落地爆發了。鄕下人那裏知道　飛機應該怎樣的躲法，大家隨着哭喊起來。（四○三）</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>世界學社李石曾歡送　十一個幼童出洋求學　昨已啓程赴日内瓦世界學校</h3>
<p>本市福開森路三九三號世界學社、昨午歡送赴歐世界學校中國師生十三人、由中委李石曾氏</p>
<p>設延欵待中國年幼學生之赴歐留學者、此當爲第一次、上午聚餐午後六時上船出國、茲誌其詳情如下、</p>
<p>到會來賓世界社昨午舉行聚餐大會、歡送世界學校中國師生、到會者除師生十三人外、尙有被邀之來賓及學生家長、全國經委會顧問摩納、秘書馬肅、中委張靜江夫婦、賑務會主席許世英、駐日公使蔣作賓夫人、中醫陸仲安、名伶程艷秋曁齊雲靑等中外人氏百餘人、</p>
<p>聚餐情形席間賓主酬酢、頗形歡樂、直至一時餘始畢、同時對學生舉行一簡單考試、使各學生抄寫西文本人在日内瓦學校的姓名和住址、抄寫中文的旅行紀程、同時再以口試、</p>
<p>師生題名第一二次赴日内瓦留學生者除率領之敎師潘先生、向先生謝先生及謝</p>
<p>胡夫人外、尙有學生陸沃若男、河北、九歲、陸馥若、女、河北、十歲、胡祥熊、男、江蘇、十歲、許蓮子、女、安徽、十歲張乃琪、女、浙江、十二歲、程永光、男、河北、十歲賈志齋、男、河北、九歲、蔣碩治、男、湖北、十二歲、蔣碩平、男、湖北、十一歲、齊希如、女、河北、十一歲、齊希堯、女、河北、九歲、等十一人、</p>
<p>船中課程在赴日内瓦途中、所定之船中功課項目如下（一）國文、（二）英語、（三）旅行常識、（四）日記、</p>
<p>作息時間晨六時、起身　漱、散步、早餐、八時半至九時半英語、十時至十一時、國文、十二時午餐、二時至三時旅行常識、六時晚餐、七時日記、八時半或九時就寢、</p>
<p>李氏報告中委李石曾氏、於歡送席上之簡單報告云、這篇記述是以「世界學校···的報告、作一個題目、······這是什麽意思呢、卽是關於世界學校種種的組織、種種的問題、作一個很簡單的總報告、若要詳細解說、是短小的篇幅與時間所不能的、若只說、兩件事、又是掛漏萬、所以必須用這「言簡而賅」的體裁、旣有了以上的界說、卽可按着這界說、逐段逐條的簡單述</p>
<p>說如左、</p>
<p>世界學校這學校設在日内瓦、法文作Ｅｃｏｌｅ　Ｉｎｔｅｒａｔｉｏｎａｌ　ｅ英文作　ＩｎｔｅｒｎａｔｉｏｎａｌＳｃｈｏｏｌ、已有不少年的歷史、其中敎員幾十人、學生一千數百人、隸於幾十國籍、所習的是英法德三國語言文字、若非用此三文的國民、當然還要溫習與增進他的國語、於此校的目的、不但是具世界的理想、尤其是在國際環境中事實上的産物了、瑞士是一個歐洲國際環境的要區、中國也是一個國際環境的要區、其性質雖異、但需要幾國語言文字與世界敎育是有事實上相同的結果、所以中國是日内瓦世界學校的一個同志國、而上海也有設中國的世界學校或世界學校的上海分校之必要、這事在計劃籌備中、</p>
<p>世界同志世界學校同志會、這會是表同情於世界學校的人所組織的、有世界學校美國同志、有世界學校中國同志會、······世界學校的校舍、卽是美國同志會所助成的、中國同志會萌芽於去歲、還沒有這個力量、但也向這方向努力、將來也定有可觀、他開始的一件事、卽是先介紹中國學生六人到校、這個最底限度目的、現在不袛達到且已超過了、這會當然以家長與師生、爲現在與將來的會員、丨師生就廣義說、不僅敎職員、凡倡導贊助員、也都是師生、至於會的詳細組織、另有報告及章程、此處所說當然只能極從簡略了、</p>
<p>首次聚餐以上是一個簡稱、且内容是包括世界學校師生與學生家長親友來賓等本會是很親切、很簡單很倉卒組織成的、有一兩位家長丨卽是張靜江夫婦丨想與率領學生出國的先生們聚談與餞行同時其他家長及組織人、因亦具有同樣的思想也是劃零爲整、避免重複、故立刻響應、直接間接的親友、亦加入了許多、並沒有長時間周密的組織、賓主已達百人了三位先生與十位學生、是主要的客、其他都是主人、也有少數來賓或適逢其會或僅主人約來陪的客人、本日正午在聚衆後、晚上六時卽上船、這樣的聚餐會似乎以後每有一次學生出國、必舉行一次、這次不但是第一次聚餐會、也是世</p>
<p>界學校中國學生歷史的第一章了</p>
<p>赴歐師生第一二次赴歐的世界學校、中國師生、第一二次並舉、是因爲第一次與第二次很難分明、正式的組織、這是第一次、非正式的其人數雖少、然去年已有一次、師生不過各一人、正式與不正式、這話說來很長、以往政府除隨家長同行的兒童、未曾允許兒童出國、自這次起、已正式許可了、故此次不但是世界學校學生第一次正式出國、也是中國學童第一次正式出國、至少是民國以來的第一次、率領學生出國的先生前後四位、</p>

<h3>市敎局潘局長　對兒童肺癆之談話　國人患癆病者一千六百萬人　大多數中於兒童時期所傳染　分别辦理注射檢騐與療養等</h3>
<p>本市敎育局長潘公　氏、爲本市小學生患有肺病者甚多、對過去之檢查及今後之救濟、發表談話於左、</p>
<h3>健敎之注意</h3>
<p>本市成立以來、對於兒童健康敎育向甚重視、前年秋、公展担任敎育局事務卽以健康敎育爲各種敎育之中心業務復得衛生局之充分合作、故健敎之推進尙速、</p>
<h3>結核之檢騐</h3>
<p>今年春、承中國紅十字會高　朗醫師等恊助、始辦理小學生結核檢騐、以資預防及治療結核病症、蓋人類之死於結核病者歲以億萬計、據精確之統計、世界結核病之死率以十萬人爲單位、牛西蘭死五十一人、埃及七十二人、美七十九人、德八十九人、英一零三人、西班牙一三六人、意一八八人、日本一八六人、我國則竟達三零七人、總計吾國患是病者爲一千六百萬人、平均第二十五人中卽有患此病者一人、而此種疾病、十分之十八由檢兒童時期所傳染、</p>
<h3>家校之合作</h3>
<p>兒童患此病後、始則一無所覺、游樂如常、苟於此時查明、及早診治、可獲全愈、於是衛生局及本局特請兒科醫師、先在市立西成及比德二小學、舉辦義務肺結核注射診察此項注射、較種痘更爲簡單、反應極微、受試之際毫無痛楚事先本局訓令學校通告家屬、詳細說明緣由、并召開家長會議、由高醫師演講、以　進行、</p>
<h3>患病之衆多</h3>
<p>受檢騐之學童、西成爲三百九十七人、比德八百二十　人、有陽性反應者、西成有二百六十二人、比德有五百四十二人、受傳染緣疑者均佔百分之六十六、但此百分之六十六有陽性反應之兒童、未必個個已成結核病者、或僅略受傳染而尙未成病、故第二步手續、當施以詳細之肺部檢查、</p>
<h3>治療之辦法</h3>
<p>有Ｘ光之肺檢查、價頗昂貴、紅十字會僅收三元材料費、爲國服務、治療方法、按以各人病情、就目下情形、分别三種辦理、（一）最輕者照常求學、但請家長特别加以營養及調理、并須長服淸魚肝油（現由衛生局吳利國科長設計重製以避腥味）（二）略病者减少上課及工作時間、上午各休養二小時、或上午求學、下午休養、并加滋補品、（三）病較重者、令卽四醫治療、檢查結果病重者幸極少、</p>
<h3>檢騐之繼續</h3>
<p>現忽聞有人謂西成比德兩校學生多患肺癆、擬不送子弟入學、實則不然、其他各校學童、倘經檢查後、亦必有同樣之驚人消息、此不獨爲一校一國之問題、全世界均遭結核菌之毒害也、下學期本局等仍請高鏡朗醫師等、繼續辦理其他各校學童之注射檢騐、</p>
<h3>療養之改進</h3>
<p>嗣後關於肺結核學童及虚弱學童等之救濟、在經濟可能範圍内、當設法多方面之療治、如市立醫院籌設兒童療養部、學校中施行太陽燈照射、日光浴、露天學校、學校給食等、今年暑期、本局等擬會同衛生局等於高橋吳淞等處開辦暑期營養班、亦以此也、政府旣在前實幹、深望民衆努力於後、民族幸甚、國家幸甚、</p>
<h3>工部局發放　本年份敎育補助費　市敎局令各校今日起前往具領　惠羣等三校未能符合暫停發給</h3>
<p>上海市敎育局訓令私立靑年會中學等七十三校云、案查前據該校呈請撥給第一特區工部局一九三四年敎育補助費、業經本局派員調查、詳加審核、并轉知工部局核辦在案、茲准工部局復函略譯聞案查下表所列各校、尙能符合本局條件、業經本局核准發給各該校一九三四年之補助費、請卽轉知於六月八日（星期五）起、照例來局具領本年第　期通常補助費、此次核准及以前歷年所未發之建築補助費、各該校爲建需要或其他目的之用在一九三五年年終、可以請求發放、自本年終以後除在特殊情形之下各校需要少數建築補助費作爲自置永久校舍之用、予以審愼攷慮外、本局將不以的欵作大宗支出、但爲急要衛生改良之需、不在此限當核發　九三五年各種補助費之前本局亟欲明瞭本年所發之補助費是否合乎指定之用、請轉飭各該校將各項購買憑單繳存本局以憑審核等由、并核定該校本年通常補助費建築補助費、准此、合行令仰知照此令、又訓令私立惠羣女子中小學寗波旅滬同鄕會第二小學三校云、案查前據該校呈請撥給第一特區工部局、一九三四年敎育補助費、業經本局派員調查、詳加審核并轉知工部局核辦在案、茲准工部局復函譯略　稱以該校未能符合該局之條件、一九三四年補助費、暫停發給等由、准此、合行令仰知照此令、</p>

<h3>猜測惠勃爾登冠軍　竟有賭博公司　英國網球無奇不有之怪事　潘萊一賠三克勞福一賠四</h3>
<p>（倫敦通訊）今年之惠勃爾登網球大會、將於六月二十五日開始、無奇不有、竟有賭博今年勝負之公司成立、全以猜測誰爲今年男子單打冠軍爲博勝負、此在惠勃爾登大會之歷史、爲第一次該公司將各球員依字母次序、印成名單、並將猜中後所賠之數附列於後、其數如下、</p>
<p>潘萊一賠三克勞福一賠四</p>
<p>奥斯汀一賠四希爾士一賠八</p>
<p>愛律生一賠八一鮑羅屆拉賠二十</p>

<h3>全滬公開手球單　打朱寬榮獲冠軍　雙打錦標亦由朱寬洪玉魁所得　華人運動史光榮之一頁</h3>
<p>西靑發起之第一屆全滬公開單雙打手球錦標賽、參加者西人健兒頗夥、我華人加入者、單打有夏澤人、孫道勝、本屆第三名）、朱寬、雙打僅有朱寬洪玉魁除朱洪兩氏日前獲得雙打錦標外、朱氏復於昨日經兩塲猛惡之大戰、以二十一比十九、二十二比二十、獲得全滬單打錦標、實爲華人運動史上光榮之一頁、當時戰鬥之烈、得未曾有、茲詳述於後、</p>
<p>公開手球優勝者自右至左洪玉魁朱寬（雙打錦標又朱爲單打錦標）孫道勝（單打第三）錢一勤（指導）（啓昌攝）</p>
<p>朱氏獲得首先發球權、但隨被察卡連奪去雙方均嚴守劇攻、一上一下、經十餘分鐘、僅各得八分、旋見察氏精神一振、時來勢順連獲多分、造成十八對十二之優勢、此時朱氏何甘示弱極力反攻、追至二十、復被蔡氏獲得一分、但朱氏見機不可失、馬上奪回、出奇制勝、奪得最後一分、成二十一對十九、而勝第　局、</p>
<p>先由蔡氏發球、經十五次回合、雙方僅各得三分、隨後朱氏殺擊兇猛以十比六占得上風、蔡氏雖緊追其後、亦獲數分、惟終不克超過朱氏最近比數時、爲十二比十一、仍由朱氏引領、隨後雙方愈戰愈烈、蔡氏曾造成各十五之平手又被朱氏獲得四分、成十九對十五之優勢、但不久</p>
<p>蔡氏盡力苦戰、追至十八分、此時雙方精力皆疲、朱氏復得一分、成二十比十八、但蔡氏乘機奪回二分、成各二十之平手、幸朱氏機警過人、力殺兩分、獲得最後之勝利、遂榮得本屆單打錦標、</p>
<p>就大體觀之、朱氏球蓋實勝蔡氏一等、惟蔡氏日昨頗多殺救、左手經一週之練習、長進頗速、體力强幹、惟其智略遠不及朱氏、此次單雙打兩錦標均爲華人所得、蓋因球藝之精良、始克獲此良好結果也、</p>

<p>第二戰排球賽昨日於藝奪舉行、雙方實力在伯仲之間、第一局開始後、之江卽節節前導、以十　比五易地再戰、藝專雖欲急起直追、而之江將士用命、擘殺挽救、皆臻佳妙、卒以二十一比十二勝第一局、第　局開始後、藝專藉發球之機、連得四分、之江追上一分後、形勢仍無起色、以十八對三之絶大比數、屈居下風、藝專滿謂勝利可操、孰知之江隊昌沉着應戰、先由尹淑淸發球加上五分、旋比數成二十比十六、之江黃佳慶得最後發球之機會、形勢頓爲緊漲、連獲六分、又以二十二比二十反敗爲勝、第三局勝負已無關得失、由藝專奪回一局云、</p>

<h3>關於人性</h3>
<p>— 非心</p>
<p>神話中有一個人的謎，是早上四隻脚，午時兩隻脚，昏夜三隻脚。</p>
<p>小孩在地上爬行，老年策着拐杖，這二者，沒有多大的分别。純潔，天眞。如果說人性非空，有神與人二種性，則神性在這兩個時期中可算最發揚吧。丨丨天工似的形體，與超越底原始底靈魂。</p>
<p>無論黑種人黃種人的小孩，聚在一處，沒有高下之區别，因爲血色皆係殷紅。無論黃種人黑種人的老年在一處，也沒有大小的分際，因爲髮色皆係蒼白。惟有人生的中段，有國家，種類的懸殊；有政治，外交的把戲。而渠們的血，是綠色，或是黑色的。</p>
<p>孔子這三戒，戒之在色，在鬥，在得，是可算懂到人性的，正是指這班勞勞碌碌的人。也暗合佛家的戒痴，瞋，貪，不過後者廣大一點。哲人渺渺茫茫的說敎，好像並不比聰明人愚蠢，倒是還更聰明一點點，所以這般說的吧，四足與三足者不與焉。惟有二足時代，食色滿足之後，最算可怕的了。</p>
<p>如果汩沒了神性，毁壞了靈魂，則所餘者是純物質的中年人，至可哀憫。這時皇然如落水者想有把捉，謀在人羣裏生存，或超出人羣，猛力地固執一切。時常隱隱有一種恐怖，想道：一旦死去，不是什麽都沒有了麽？於是努力執着，讓人性發展到極端，無所不屬，生種種罪過。</p>
<p>而流光是無情的消逝的，不覺時與運頽，如略有反省，則又覺所執着的皆是虚妄，眞是「一切皆空」。回憶一生，處處發生悔恨，依然皇皇，如此際神性恢復過來，自己受着無形的鞭笞，則可算人間地獄！</p>
<p>懂到人生朝暮的人們，稍體察自己，則將略變其所爲吧！世界的也要有些改變的。</p>
<h3>另一提議　丨關於翻印古書丨</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>在「文學」「中國文學研究專號」上，看到源先生的「向翻印古書者提議」一文，因而也想說一說久已蓄在自己心裏的一點意見。</p>
<p>我的意見是這樣：凡是有永久的價値而爲大多數人所需要的古書，譬如「二十四史」那樣，應該用較劣的紙張較小的字翻印，使能以最低的價格出售，而廣爲流通。</p>
<p>提議用上述的辦法印行古書，其好處，在有錢的讀書家或藏書家，恐怕是不會了解，但大多數的讀者一定能知道。譬如一部「水滸」，卽普通的石印本，至少也要一元多，但市上有一種劣本子，却只需二三角　　爲什麽有這樣便宜的呢？自然是因爲紙張劣，印刷壞，而且，因爲是翻印古書，稿費和版稅也省下了，所以成本實在輕。也許在上述的幾種之外，還有使成本更輕的别的原因，那是非我這樣出版界的門外漢所知了。</p>
<p>因爲便宜，購買的人就很多，無論在都市，在鄕下，這類書都極流行。在不喜買書的大學生的書架上，在不知書本爲何物的摩登女郎的妝臺旁，和敎科書一同，時常也可以發現幾種劣本子的「文心雕龍」，「蘇黃尺牘」，「世說新語」，「牡丹亭」之類。因爲單是作爲擺飾，這類書也是洋裝的，還好看。至於在小店夥計的櫃台上，在鄕村敎師的枕頭旁，則這類的「七俠五義」「紅樓夢」「古文辭類纂」······差不多完全代替了先前的石印本，因爲這類是鉛印的，又有新式標點符號，看起來比石印本爽快得多，况且價錢又比石印本便宜。</p>
<p>這類的印本，是値得提倡的</p>
<p>，唯有牠纔能廣大地流行，普及於讀者層。然而，可惜的是現在印這類書的幾家書局，所翻印的都是些普通的小說和筆記，還只能供給一般低級的讀者作消遣之用，大部的有價値的書，並不見印行。所以這一件事對於文化界，在現在還不能說有什麽良好的貢獻，而且因爲老是迎合低級趣味，亂出無聊的小說，反會毒害了多數讀者的。</p>
<p>因此，我對這幾家書局有一個提議，就是以同樣的方法，計劃地系統地來翻印大部的有價値的古代名著。據我想來，倘把「二十四史」也如此翻印，則讀者只消化幾塊錢就可買到，因而買的人一定也很多，翻印者依舊可以賺錢的，他們如果能這樣做，則對於文化界的功勞，實遠在他家影印「四庫全書珍本」及精印「四部備要」之上。就是源先生所贊成的「國學基本叢書」，對大多數讀者而言，還是印得太好，賣得太貴的。</p>
<p>當然，這種本子，錯誤是不免的，因爲那製造近於粗濫。但在一般讀者，遇到幾個錯誤實在是不要緊的，有許多書，與其根本無從讀到，　可帶着錯誤讀下，讀了總比不讀有益。而且，在那些影印仿宋字體印的書中，錯誤不是也很多的麽？</p>
<h3>訪賽金花</h3>
<p>— 子衿</p>
<p>在一個北平稀有的細雨濛濛的午後，我們五個剛從南邊來的生客，被久居故都的何先生引導着，去遊覽北平的貧民娛樂塲天橋。</p>
<p>我們花了幾個銅子，聽了那沙喉嚨姑娘們唱的大鼓詞，看了打拳賣膏藥，猴子戲，和各處小攤上的奇異的東西，當我們走到一個狹隘骯髒的弄堂口時，何先生指着說：賽金花就住在這裏面。他這句偶然的指示，引起了我們的好奇心。我們懇求似的說：帶我們去見見！</p>
<p>我們走進了這兩旁都是矮房子的狹小的弄堂，站在一對破舊的大門外。見門口貼着寫上「江西魏寓」四個大字的紙條。　　我們打着門，出來開門的是一個五十多歲的老媼。她似乎認識何先生，不加詢問，就讓我們進去了。經過了一個狹長的堆積着雜物的小天井，靠左就是賽金花的臥室。我們走進那間黝黑，狹小，滿是破物的屋子。這屋子實在裝不下我們這六個人，所以後來者，只能站在門檻邊了。</p>
<p>我們這一羣陌生人的到來，顯然驚動了屋裏所有的人。當我們一進屋時。從裏半間走出一個四十上下的男子，他後邊跟着一位全身穿着素靜的黑色衣褲的女人。據何先生的介紹，她就是賽金花。她安祥地向何先生招呼。她問明了我們的來意之後。立卽連聲說：「我這裏簡陋得很，請莫見笑！請坐請坐」！</p>
<p>屋裏一切用具，一切陳設，都好像是賽金花晚年困苦，悽慘，悲鬱的生活的象徴。</p>
<p>這位艷名曾噪一時，顚倒過無數文人，雅士，英雄，豪傑，「嘗偕英皇並坐照象，時論奇文」的姑蘇美人，現在却只穿着一套破舊的黑色的棉襖褲，從那破孔中，攢出了焦黃的棉花。當年的榮華富貴，好像全從她身上逃去了似的留給她的，只是貧窮，疾病和苦痛。</p>
<p>「你老人家今年高壽多少？」○君問</p>
<p>「剛剛六十歲。老了，不中用了，常常生病，而且貧窮得很」！</p>
<p>她這一句訴苦似的答語，不得不使們驚奇，在她那白白的皮膚，輕快活潑的態度，淸脆爽朗的語聲中，至多也只能看到她是一位四十左右的中年女人。她沒有一點老態龍鍾的樣子。無論如何，不能呌人相信她已是六旬的老人了。不過臉色蒼白得可憐。這大約如其所言，因爲貧窮而營養不足，疾病常伴着她的緣故。</p>
<p>「現在怎樣維持生活呢？」</p>
<p>「完全落空，今天不知道明天。一二年來全靠家母留存下來的衣飾去換錢。此後眞不知如何生活。······」她的年輕時曾令人消魂的眼睛，此時却全爲眼淚潤濕了。</p>
<p>「此後打算怎樣？」Ｂ君同情似的問。</p>
<p>「完全沒有辦法。六十歲的老人，還容有什麽計劃？······不過我想回南邊去。蘇州還有我的弟婦，姪兒姪女，我想回去看看他們。江南現在已是鳥語花香的時節了吧。南邊來的幾位先生，報告我一些江南的情景！」</p>
<p>「······」</p>
<p>「我現在有一個願望，想回到江南去。到杭州去找得一塊墓地。俗語說，住要住在蘇州，死要葬在杭州。我現在只有這一點小小的願望。但是這顯然又是夢想······」她不勝悲傷似的說。</p>
<p>「那是容易的事！」Ａ女士接着安慰她。</p>
<p>「······」</p>
<p>「我又想吃素修行」她轉爲安靜似的說。</p>
<p>「······」</p>
<p>「太太請客人吃茶；」引我們進來的那位五十多歲的女人，端了茶點進來。賽金花向她看了一眼轉過頭來告訴我們：　　「這是一個忠實的僕人！他自我年輕時服侍我，一直到現在。現在我沒有錢僱她，但她却情願跟着我吃苦！」</p>
<p>我們六個人的眼睛，一齊轉注到這位女僕身上。她有着一副忠厚，耐苦，勇敢的容貎，與壯健的身體。</p>
<p>我們吃了茶，替賽金花照了相，便辭了出來。</p>
<p>待走出了大門，每一個人，却異口同音的念出了兩句詩來：</p>
<p>門前冷落車馬稀，老大嫁作商人婦！</p>
<p>（一九三四，五，一二。）</p>
<h3>蛙歌</h3>
<p>— 王一心</p>
<p>蛙之曲有如暴雨</p>

<p>一片緊張的情調</p>
<p>塗上這幽靜的村夜。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>牠追隨你的左右</p>
<p>如同滿天的星光；</p>
<p>繁華的夜樂</p>
<p>奏起白日裏農作的緊張。</p>
<h3>獨秀峯旁的春天</h3>
<p>— 映冰</p>
<p>太陽晒着人已覺到一點兒熱，風吹來也不似以前的冷了。這是春天！</p>
<p>江南的春天算是很使人羨慕的天氣了，然而南國的春之更不壞，尤其是使我不時想起獨秀峯旁的春天。</p>
<p>「桂林山水甲天下，這是誰都知道的一句話，其實說到我們廣西隨處都有山，有水，都有很美麗的天然的風景的。</p>
<p>只要一進了廣西的大門丨梧州，不論你由柳河到柳州，或由撫河到桂林，沿途都有「山水」給你看，水似乎是在山的夾隙中流，山是連綿不斷的拖起去：山上有森森的樹，山脚有村莊，河畔有菜畦，有柳樹···河邊有漁船，一到春天，眼睛所見到的都是一遍淸爽的景緻。船在夾山中走，每每要遇到「山窮水盡疑無路」的時候，然而一轉灣，就豁然開朗了。</p>
<p>如果到了桂林，風景當然有相當的美麗，來給别人讚嘆，其中出色的就是獨秀峯。</p>
<p>獨秀峯在城的中央，明時靖江王府的後背，現在在獨秀峯旁建有一個中山紀念塔，圍着獨秀峯成了一個中山公園。　　獨秀峯是筆直的同一桿筆一樣，底下大，上面小，到頂點更小，有幾座小廟，遠遠望去就同一個筆尖；並不高，有三百六十五級。峯下有個池丨月牙池，春天水漲了，裏面可以划船：池中有個亭，用曲橋通到兩岸。</p>
<p>以前我們就在獨秀峯旁的學校讀書，中山公園就是我們的校園。在春天，遊人特别多，風景也特别美麗，花兒草兒似乎也爲高興的遊人而高起來。我同萍，華，芬，都在快樂的春天做過高興的遊人。現在呢？萍，華，芬，都很久不知道她們的消息了。</p>
<p>美麗的獨秀峯旁的春天，我想你當不會沒有我們而會减色的。現在又是春天來了，一些春情，春意，不禁使我想到過去的獨秀峯旁的春天的寳貴的時光。</p>

<h3>火災（四）</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>我接着接見了許多舊時的友伴，他們都顯得有點老了，并且大家都失了舊時那種潑刺歡樂的顔色，好像經過了一塲災禍，各人都換過了另一個人一樣。便是我那老同學張文天君丨福和號的老板丨本來也是够活潑的孩子，我們十年前曾經駕着脚踏車在森林的道途間賽跑，也曾划着馬來的小舟在有潮的河道裏競過速率的；現在却老成得多了，顯出是担着重担的成人，并且面目間竟是一位運籌握算的商人哩。</p>
<p>他約我晚間十時半去赴他們在他店裏開的歡宴會，那一般少年們組成的，爲了歡迎我的緣故。</p>
<p>晚飯時候，和姑丈談了一些親戚近狀，唐山（七）情况，和一些南洋的新聞。陪他老人家喝了一點酒，然後從這裏踱出來，跑到左上第三間福和號去。我的姑丈的事情聽說還未弄完，我是不便煩擾他；并且在那邊，談話是更自由，行動是可更爲放縱的。</p>
<p>在福和號的店裏，情景的冷寂倒差不多，不過貨物却堆積得比我的親戚店裏的還要多。因爲在晚上，慘淡的燈光映在冷凄凄的玻璃貨櫉上，景象更覺悽凉。張君見我來了，熱情地迎着，招呼我喝一兩杯潮州「工夫茶」（八）。雖然我現在已經不多喝茶了，然而十年前却曾嘗味到這種古色古香的茶味和詩意。現在飲起了這種非常濃郁的茶味，雖然有點苦，然而舊友的熱情却是甘的，那只得喝喝些罷。</p>
<p>因爲時間早，所以他陪着我去在這小村市裏的幾道馬路裏散着步。這馬路，雖然疏落地有店，有屋，然而遮不住椰林和檳榔樹的露出在馬路兩旁。在較寂靜的幾道馬路裏，「阿答厝「（九）還隱約地閃現着，這鄕村的原始的風味還好好地被保存着。以前，我們常常在這裏渡過傍晚的好時光，當太陽下山而晚凉來到的時候。我已經想着恐怕不能再領略這種美景了，雖知道現在又來嘗着這種意味？</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>道理</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>聽說北方人是最視重道理的。要是你給他一塲辱駡，或償予三二個耳光吃吃，首先他就要問你是否講理；如果你能淸楚地說出你對待他的大道理來，那他也就默然忍受，自認晦氣；不然，他就以整個生命，來與你拚個你死我活，也所不惜了。</p>
<p>本來，爲尊重道理而不顧一切的人，是値得人家敬佩和讚歎的；但，由此也就足够地表露出他的傻笨和愚魯來；因爲他根本就不明白道理原是個圓滑的東西。</p>
<p>因母病私乘君車，將剩桃奉獻君上，以博得君主的嘉奬，但也正因此而致招殺身之禍，這故事是誰都曉得的。及至而今，事體的變幻，更是來得奇特了：明明殺人放火，則曰維持世界和平，明明硬奪强佔，則曰睦隣親善，許多年來，每一次大大小小的事件的發生，何嘗不是依據着一篇大道理而來的呢？可憐一班服膺道理的人們，就在這下面無聲無息地忍辱負屈了。</p>
<p>一個國家的文化程度怎樣，常是以該國人民的對於道理的遵守的情形爲凖繩；因爲個個講理，則蠻性盡脫，沒有强凌弱衆暴寡之事，則天下太平。我國有數千年來的歷史，我國人民經了這麽久的鍜鍊和薰陶，服膺道理的程度，逢然會比他人高出一籌；但，可惜的，也正因我國是最講道理的國家，把道理講到極端，弄到頭頭是道，事莫非理；所以仍不免大有吃虧受屈而不自知者。　　全不講理固不可，盡信理也是很危險的啊！</p>
<h3>國際勞工大會</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>最近日内瓦萊芒湖畔，紛紛的熙嚷着國聯行政院，顧間委員會，軍縮等的會議，世界的政治家外交家專門家不斷的聚集於「和平宮」中，山陰道上，冠蓋往還，頗極一時之盛。這些事件在我們腦際尙覺「餘音嫋嫋」的時候，有四十六國代表參加的國際勞工大會，又濟濟一堂的在湖影波光中開幕了。這一塊地方素來就爲一般世界政治舞台要人所充塞盤踞，人人得知其爲「伸張正義，努力和平」，這且不在話下，現在竟有各國之所謂「工人代表」者相與媲美，集議於斯，自然不容我們不與以相當的注意。　　勞工運動的發展，尤其是勞工階級國際團結的表現，在現時略一談到，足使一般日趨沒落之階級的人聞而咋舌，因爲這一事態的前進，必然要提到勞動大衆自身生活實際改進的問題，以及爲改進自身生活而變更與之相杌隍的現存社會制度的問題，但是這些事件的提出與推進，均須與各國之關心社會治安者短兵相接。可是此次國聯「勞工」大會，竟能堂而皇之的在萊芒河畔舉行牠第十八次的例會，這卽是牠奇特的地方，不能與其他勞工大會視作一列。</p>
<p>在目前經濟恐慌日益加深，大戰危機益趨緊迫的狀况下，勞動者一方面受盡减工資加工時及凍餒失業等的痛苦，一方面復痛感失去生存自由及被迫作「肉彈丸」的威脅；如果此言不虚，爲一般人所承認，那這些事件的澈底解决卽現時勞動者的課題，須一致爭取的「工人利益」。如此，則這班國際勞工大會的代表在「和平宮」裏，議論壇坫，將在這些問題上怎樣謀工人的福祉呢？</p>
<p>據日内瓦電稱：「與世界勞工有切有錢的任爾行爲卑鄙，到要受人歡迎！</p>
<p>畸形的社會　矛盾的都市４義</p>
<p>沒錢的儘管舉止大方，到要受人鄙棄！</p>
<p>身關係之問題將提出討論：···議程主要議案爲救濟世界失業計劃：···并提倡大規模公共工程以减少失業，四十小時工作制之擁護者或將敦促最後宣讀四十小時工作制草約，大會亦將以失業保險，及其他援助失業工人之草約付最後宣讀」云云，在這些議程中，到可見到大會的代表們也認爲失業是世界此刻的嚴重事態，弄得許多現社會統治者頭昏眼花，但是他們却限於自身「顔色眼鏡」的光圈，有意的或始終不能透過這一事態，呈露出何以産生失業之社會組織的問題。因之國際勞工大會只能頭痛醫頭，而且毫不兌現的，將失業保險及他援助失業工人之草約宣讀宣讀。至四十小時工作制，雖「勞工專家」表示與美國之新業規并不衝突；但以英國反對，「不信其能通過會議」，則更爲「議而不决」之尤者也。</p>
<p>這一國際勞工大會之「主要議程」，其本質已如此，所以雖然大會再選舉「保障工人利益委員會」，卽信其「通過會議」，未見便能眞正「保障工人利益」。至若對於德國效果「訓勉有加」，將以之申請各國興築之「公共工程」，别的不論，我們知道近來希特勒之備戰熱甚，軍事工業極形發達，其他美國英國法國日本等亦復如此，大約這卽是國際勞工大會救濟失業的「公共工程」？牠的解决失業！</p>
<p>按國際勞工大會爲國際聯盟下勞工局所召集，在其現有被選之二十四行政人員中，十二人爲各國政府代表，六人爲工人代表，六人爲資方代表，此卽國際勞工大會之所以爲國際勞工大會也。</p>
<h3>樣會的話</h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>朋友：</p>
<p>從你底來信中，我約略看到你一點苦悶的自畫像；你從敎育，從智識，從學者的書本中，從敎授的口述中，建立了一個十全十美的未來的憧憬；而你拿了這個憧憬，如果儘關在房子裏，儘沈在受人的懷抱裏，儘鑽在槪論大綱裏，那還不至於發生什麽問題，你現在一且碰到了現實，碰得皮破骨裂，那本來是</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>意中事，並不足怪的。鐵給投到溶爐裏去鍜練的時候，在鐵的本身也許不是一件愉快的事；而况你所得到的功課，還祗不過是現實的老師給你安擺下的一章最初的序論呢？</p>
<p>你說覺得這世界樣樣都有點不大對，樣樣都有點不如意；而對了這「不大對」與「不如意」，你又沒法去找出它底病源，療法當然更不必說了。「發現了不如意而又不得不生活在這無辦法的不如意中，是「件最痛苦的事」。誠如你所說的；然而，知道了原因，知道了辦法，如果你缺少幹的力量，也同樣地會使你煩惱的，這一點你曾想到沒有呢？　　承你拿煩悶的原因和解决的方法來問我，但是我一點也不能告訴你什麽。關於這你最好去問問以編講義大綱擅長的美國式的中國敎授，或者靑年指導專家們，他們一定會極流熟的後１２３４而ＡＢＣＤ的逐條背給你聽，雖然原因對不對，辦法有用沒用是個問題，然而他們終究是個指導；而我的年齡簡直和你差不多，自己也還是正在黑暗裏摸索的人，自己也找不到具體的解除苦悶的方法：而且，有的時候也還不免和你一樣的苦悶着咧。對於你這「求仙方」式的渴望，我能忍心把自己所不知道的香灰和蠟爛油來給你做仙丹嗎？</p>
<p>然而，正因爲自己也是同你一樣的正在耐心地飲着靑春底苦酒，是踏着險濤過來的；而到現在，更給投進了白熱的火；而且我們也常在一起，談着無所不談的話。我以爲懂得一個人最淸楚的，除了他自己就再也沒有别人了，那末我對你底觀察與認識，或者也能說就是我們自己認識自己呢？</p>
<p>對你，别的話我不能說，但有一個現象使我深深地不解的，便是：你太崇拜命運，太相信機會了：因之，對自己便發生了懷疑與不信任。可是，機會和命運是常常把人從現實中拉開去的，而你所看到的，所身受的，却偏都是現實的最醜惡的面貎，你底憧憬和身子是便在你身上矛盾地滋長着了。</p>
<p>這是不是我們底悲劇的泉源呢？</p>
<p>在我，從饑餓中，從活命的朝夕籌思中，從對生活的浴衆戰爭中，我學到了一個新的功課，深深地相信：人是不容易被輕視的動物；惟其如此，自己也不大願意輕視自己的。</p>
<p>相信自己並不一定就是懐疑别人，這一點大約無需多說了吧？</p>
<p>然而在這時代，像你這樣的人或者會被一般的社會所容納的，因爲他們正要人丢掉了現實去追求機會，追求命運啊。猶疑不决而一事無成的「漢姆萊脫」型的靑年，不是在被人認爲安分的嗎？　　這時代是有許多人在用機會誘着人的，你如不能相信自己，而還是迷戀着機會與命運的話，那末我勸你去多買幾條航空奬劵吧，說不定會着一個頭奬的。</p>
<p>否則祇有走另一條路：相信自己。　　但無論你走那一條路丨丨買獎劵或是相信自己，我都以十二分的誠意來祝你成功。</p>
<h3>談牢獄生活</h3>
<p>— 李葵</p>
<p>誰都怕過牢獄生活。因爲一個自由的「人」，一進了牢獄，就變成不自由的「物」了。像籠中鳥一樣；門是成天的鎖着，屋子是沒有一點陽光，一天吃着住行都在小小的屋子裏，是多麽可怕呀！　　可是，在可怕之餘，却使人戀戀不捨的。雖然我出來後，就决不想再去過牢獄生活；可是牢獄生活給我的印象是很好的。至少還使我非常留戀牢獄中的生活。實在的。牢獄給我的印象並不十分可怕。</p>
<p>雖然牢獄裏的飯菜吃了容易生病，雖然在牢獄裏住久容易將一個好人變成癈人，變成死人！但是在精神方面，確能得到在外邊得不到的安慰。這安慰幾乎能使人忘却了身受的苦痛。</p>
<p>在牢獄裏可以找到眞實的朋友。牢獄是小社會：但是在大社會上所有者虚僞與冷酷，這裏是沒有的。因爲他們都是處於同一的壓迫下。</p>
<p>要是誰給我們一種無理的迫害，我們就一致去抵抗。要是失敗了，大家難過；要是勝利了，就相抱着跳起舞來。實在的，我們是不分彼此的。</p>
<p>在牢獄裏是充滿了純摯的愛，天眞的愛。我們是如此自然：我們要抱，就盡情的抱：我們要吻，就盡情的吻；旣沒有人笑話，又沒有人干涉：我們眞是溶化在偉大的愛的爐中。</p>
<p>實在的，這種自然的愛，在外邊是找不到的；就像我和阿秋吧，在裏邊我俩是時常擁抱的；現在見了面，除了握握手，就沒有更純摯的表示了。</p>
<p>牢獄中的生活是充滿了眞實的愛情，如果你要不得已的被拉去的時候，你也不要害怕！那裏能使你得到在外邊得不到的東西。</p>
<h3>雜語</h3>
<p>— 依籬</p>
<p>窮人的飯碗等於有錢人的便桶。</p>
<p>摩登女子的屁股，與富貴人的臉嘴，是一樣受人敬愛的，</p>
<p>失勢的嘴裏所說的話，如垃圾桶内的垃圾一樣無用，得意的人口内流出的吐沫，反像五月裏，鰣魚一般高貴。</p>
<p>窮苦人死了，有兒子也像沒兒子，富貴人死了，就是沒有兒子，也能子孫滿堂。</p>
<p>做人，寗願死，不要窮。</p>
<p>上海的中下級社會的女人，無論她們一天書都沒有讀過，但是她們總可以認識幾十個字，什麽原由呢？因爲麻雀牌内的東南西北，還有打花會的三十六門，只幾十個字，她們記得爛熟的。</p>
<p>小孩子剛學語的時候，他就知道怎樣去駡人。</p>
<h3>人情是冷暖的</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>誰不歎息道：「人情是冷暖的！」當一個人顯赫的當兒，無論那個都要來尊敬他。一旦這個人不幸失敗了，那眞有隔世之感，到處便會遭逢白眼。反過來說，一個人陷入困頓之中，要被人看不起。偶而交了運，身價也就自然而然的抬高起來。這是什麽緣故？因爲這個人前後已是兩個人了。在這里，充分說明着人是趨勢利的。因爲趨勢利，所以對於富貴人家，要加以崇奉。對於窮困人家，要加以輕視。</p>
<p>其實，人也許並沒有兩樣。富貴時候，是這個人。窮困時候，也還是這個人。所不同的，是支撑着這個人的環境。而一班趨炎附勢者，他們所崇奉的，也並不是這個人，而是這個人的地位權勢。他們所輕視的，也並不是這個人，而是這個人的破衣弊履。</p>
<p>但是，地位權勢，是人家的地位權勢，與自己全無干連，爲什麽要崇奉他？蓋崇奉他，有時候常會得到好處，何樂而不爲？至破衣弊履，是人家的破衣弊履，與本身也沒有妨礙，爲什麽要輕視他？這就是點難說了。除了爲堤防他來告窮乞憐，那只有討厭可解說了。</p>
<p>人永遠是趨勢利的。人情永遠是冷暖的。我想，設有個人，他從得意走入失勢，在這道路中，他可以嘗到兩種不同的人生味，也可以認識了兩種不同的世人的面目！</p>
<h3>悲哀</h3>
<p>— 叔豪</p>
<p>浮雲在天空狂奔着，梧桐葉經過了風的吹動，發出淅淅的聲音來，可怕的夜神已執行牠的威權，把黑暗的幔幕籠罩着大地，這時候，四周寂靜得像死一樣，祇有幾只將死的秋蟲，若斷若續的哀吟着。黑壓壓地，看不見什麽東西，但向東望去，却有一縷微弱的燈光，從一所小小的屋裏直射出來，從那已破的窗隙中，隱約地可以看到室内的一切　　這是一間不盈方丈的小樓，中央一只破舊的書桌，桌上堆滿不整齊的書籍，中央亂散着毛筆鋼筆墨水等。旁邊一只矮凳，一只的行軍床，煤油燈吊在室的中央，微弱的燈光就從這裏發出來的　　一個淸瘦的靑年，雙手捧着面頰，蓬亂的頭髮，披在他的眉角，他坐在凳上，把整個的頭，埋到兩臂之中。忽然悠悠地嘆了口氣，同時雙手更動了位置，交义的放在桌上，頭也微微地抬了起來，一對失潤的眼珠，注視着那盞半明半暗的洋油燈，呆呆地出神。他悲到七年前的秋夜，他的父親咽最後一口氣的時候。一個快樂的家庭從此被悲哀籠罩着：可憐的母親，年幼的妹妹，爲了生活壓迫，到遙遠的故鄕去了。而他，在沒有自立能力的時候，不得不在生活的鐵蹄下掙扎。他搖了搖頭，不能繼續想下去，兩顆發光的淚珠却從眼眶中延流下來。</p>

<h3>疏遠了原有的家庭麽？·</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個十九歳的靑年，現在本埠一家報關行裏服務。我的原籍是崑山，家裏祗有一位慈愛的母親和一位年幼的妹妹，此外還有一個哥哥和一位嫂嫂。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>哥哥在無錫經商，但沒有生過孩子，在一個月前吧，有一位親戚提起我的婚姻，介紹我去作人家的贅婿，當時我沒說什麽話。老實說，我的環境，確無娶妻能力，但我覺得無娶妻的必要，所以從未煩惱過。現在要我疏遠了原有的有庭，和慈母兄妹等，而去作人家的贅婿確非所願，但除此外便說不出具體的反對理由，假如母親等都贊成我去作贅婿，那麽我應採取何種辦法呢？先生！你瞧這事怎樣辦才對？遇迫不得已時什麽辦法，我都願幹的，一切請你在報端賜復吧！我萬分期待着，敬祝撰安！艾家楠敬上。</p>
<p>答：我不知道你爲什麽怕做人家贅婿。「疎遠原有的家庭」是你的過慮，這是不成其爲理由的。贅婿雖則要住在岳家裏，但岳家卻决不會限止女婿的行動，不准你與「原有的家庭」接近。與家庭「疎遠」和「接近」，完全要看你自己，旁人是無法勉强的。你以爲必須住在家庭裏纔算與家庭接近，這是大錯特錯。這樣的疎遠，男子是不免的，不必做了贅婿纔會如此。你現在在上海做事，據你的來信，家庭似乎還在原籍，這不是與家庭，疎遠了麽？所以，你單以「疎遠」而來反對人贅，是不够的。婚烟所成爲問題的是男女雙方是否合得來，及將來對於婚姻的負担這兩樣，你對於這次親戚介紹的婚姻，也應當從這二點去考慮，入贅與否我認爲是不成問題的。編者</p>

<h3>長安印象記</h3>
<p>— 雲山</p>
<p>正當春天三月的時候，我作了一次西北的旅行，由首都南京乘火車，經過行都洛陽，抵潼關，乘汽車，直達陪都西安。</p>
<p>西安卽古長安：亦稱西京。我現在凖備叙述的若干印象，并無關於國計民生的大旨。那些問題，讓開發西北的「專家」們去發揮宏論罷！我的所謂印象不過是如此：</p>
<p>一·晴天的和雨天的泥</p>
<p>「無風三尺士，有雨一街泥」，這是前人譏評北平街道的名句。如果移贈給長安古道，則有過之無不及！長安的「灰」和「泥」，的確有牠特殊的物質基礎。</p>
<p>這座古城中的街道，大部份是原始的土路，平常雨量不多的西北，本來就容易灰沙勃勃的；加以舊式大車終日不停的壓軋，和長途汽車的往來奔馳，滿城飛舞的黃土，自然更有可觀！假如再起點風的話。那就「日月無光，山河易色」了！</p>
<p>這兒的泥，和别處不同的，第一是富於黏性；第二是因了火車和汽車的壓軋，一下雨，路上就泥濘不堪！</p>
<p>因爲土質的富於黏性，往往大雨後街道中變爲「泥潭」了，而兩旁竟可讓你穿乾鞋走路！不過，你得留心，照着路上已有的脚跡前進：精神集中！一點也不能疎忽；否則就有滑入「泥潭」中的危險。</p>

<h3>轟動好萊塢的捉迷藏戲　環球女明星蘇力文的怪脾氣（上）</h3>
<p>— 嘉謨</p>
<p>環球影片公司的新女明星瑪珈雷蘇力文氏Ｍａｒｇａｒｅｔ　Ｓｕｌｌｖａｎ這位一鳴驚人的女明星、她的第一部作品「新怨舊愁」“ｏｎｌｙ　Ｔｅｓｔｅｒｄａｙ”公映之後、引起世界觀衆的贊嘆。在上海曾映於在南京大戲院，吸引不少多情觀衆的眼淚。在一般奮鬥多年的女明星還不易做到的成績，我們這位新明星却不費吹灰之力，一躍成名。怎能怪得人們的特别注意。</p>
<p>蘇力文原是紐約百老匯路舞臺上的名女伶，在歌劇院中已有了多年的經騐和名譽、不過只限於紐約一隅而已。她在去年結婚了，在她爲了一時熱情的衝動，她和一個倖運兒名呌亨利方苔Ｈｅｎｒｙ　Ｆｏｎｄａ結婚，但結婚後就感覺到性不相投，只有兩個月便離婚了。這是蘇力文提出的。</p>
<p>因爲這一點的羅曼斯，於是蘇力文遂成爲好萊塢一般電影記者和好奇者的集中人物。我們知道，美國的新聞記者不是容易對付的。而且所發的問題又繁複而又多涉及陰私的。回答了不好，不回答也不好。在平常的女明星總是盡力去敷衍他們，可是逢到蘇力文，她是一個所謂「艷若桃李，冷若冰霜」的好子。她簡直感覺到支持不下去。竟以「三十六計，走爲上計」的方法，從好萊塢逃到紐約去。個性之强，打破了好萊塢一切的記錄。</p>
<p>當她拍完「舊怨新愁」的時候，她突然不見了。環球公司到處找她，要和她商量下一部片子的事，後來才知道她逃回紐約去了。原因是逃出了記問者的環繞。可是消息一傳出，便有許多人跟到紐約去找她，同時紐約的訪問者如蟻之附膻似的。迫得她只好搬到秘密的地方去住。但爲合同上的關係，她不久回到環球公司來了。開始拍她的第二部新片，“Ｌｉｔｔｌｅ　Ｍａｎ，　Ｗｈａｔ　Ｎｏｗ·</p>
<p>新片開拍未久，她又失踪了。她一個人跑到好萊塢的飛機塲，一個皮箱也不携帶，她乘飛機到芝加哥去了。</p>
<p>但在二十四小時之後，她又飛回來了。她說，「我是眞給這多訪問者纒得昏了。我只好飛到芝加哥去一躺，把我的氣憤吹冷下去再說。」</p>
<p>當她回到攝塲去的時候，公司裏的職員告訴她：「明天是公司總理卡爾拉密氏的六十七歲的生日，公司已經派定你去切生辰餅了。」</p>
<p>「我决不情願這樣做的。」蘇力文老不客氣的說出。她還不認識好萊塢的習俗。本來這是一個榮譽的差使，因爲她在公司裏是被認爲第一個女明生呢。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「女作家」</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>Ｉ　Ｂｅｌｉｅｖｅｄ　ｉｎ　Ｙｏｕ丨大上海</p>
<p>假如你抱着一種熱望去看「女作家」也許要使你失望，因爲這裏非但沒有暴露可言，倒完全是對現實的惡意的歪曲　　很明顯的，「女作家」是站在美國紳士們的視角上來表現大衆作家的。</p>
<p>所謂勞工運動的革命者，大衆詩人，大衆畫家，大衆舞蹈家，在「女作家」中是被惡意的視爲酗酒的，色情的，以欺騙與誇大爲職業的莠民。我們在畫面上看到的是一些酒徒，賭徒，偷竊，沒有信義，沒有眞實的友誼與愛的流氓。　　這是說明了什麽呢？</p>
<p>首先，美國紳士們再不敢閉着眼不看見他們的敵人在他們的羣衆中間丨丨指一般中間層丨丨的領導應響的擴大，於是他們需要造一點謠，拿一點虚構的</p>
<p>「事實」來混亂羣衆的視綫。</p>
<p>其次、在大衆解放運動者之羣中，目前有一部份人是過着羅曼蒂克的私生活，使紳士們可以扭住一點而誇大起來，進行中傷的陰謀。但是，我們知道，儘管甘地的和生活如何刻苦，其他總是英帝國主義的代理人，而小市民出身的大衆解放運動者的羅曼蒂克性是無可避免的，只在實踐的鍜煉中才會丢棄它，况且一個人的生活是多方面的，刻苦的從事大衆的解放運動以推進歷史的一方面，對於紳士們自然是痛心疾首的，那麽，紳士們的有意誇大羅曼蒂克的一面，乃是一種無恥行爲，不是很容易明白的了麽？</p>
<p>無論如何，我們應該承認「女作家」的應負的使命是很巧妙的完成的。「女作家」實際上寫的是一件戀愛故事，但是它能脫掉好萊塢所有戀愛故事的俗套丨丨那廉價的Ｈａｐｐｙｈ－ｅｎｄｉｎｇ。</p>
<p>美國紳士們看到在他們的沒落的途程中、許多智識分子動搖及走向歷史的進步的階級，如「女作家」中的女主人公曼麗（雖然它并不能較詳細的解釋她的所以動搖、但至少它已告訴我們，曼麗是一個正義感很强烈的智識分子。）而怕起來，於是，借着一位富有的御用批評家，密楷的口，用種種莫須有的挑撥性的虚構去煽惑她的懦弱的心靈：不僅如此，「女作家」表現出來的主題，就是大衆解放運動者是靠不住的壞蛋，可信賴的是紳士們的御用批評家。而最巧妙的，「女作家」竟讓曼麗成爲「女作家」而「單獨」去「奮鬥」！</p>
<p>什麽是「單獨去奮鬥」呢？就是把中間層從歷史的進步階級領導下分化開來。假如依照了美國式戀愛故事的一般慣例來一個大團圓，則觀衆會很容易的當作一般的慣例那樣卽刻忘記掉，而在現在，明顯的有一個問題放在觀衆面前：究竟曼麗走到那裏去？不是麽？在畫面上看到的那種象徴着前途的茫茫的烟霧，洛絲曼愛姆絲在人叢中孤單單的擠進擠出的跟鏡頭，和這位新進明星臉上所流露出來的迷羊般的神情，强調地在觀衆前面提出了這個問題，而實際上是把女作家拉到了紳士們的營壘裏！</p>
<p>結果，使觀衆同情曼麗，厭惡高祺他們，而感佩密楷，這便是紳士們的全部奸計！</p>
<p>洛絲曼愛姆絲與約翰鮑爾斯的演技，尤其是前者，是成功的。</p>

<h3>海枯石爛　（Ｒｅｇｉｓｔｅｒｅｄ　Ｎｕｅｓｅ）（四）</h3>
<p>— 擷華</p>
<p>朋登收拾了幾件傢伙，走到割治室去。海特威看見她來了，很高興的用響亮的聲音問她道：「腦筋穩定嗎？好！我先要將她的腦殼鋸開丨丨裏面有瘀血塞信了血管丨丨她成了瘋人了丨丨前一兩天就很厲害的」。他是實是求是的講解那病的症候，覺得朋登一定會了解的。不意朋登手一鬆，傢伙鐺鎯一聲掉在磁磚舖的地板上。海特威抬頭一看，看見朋登張大了一張嘴，就嚇了他一跳。這時舒樂絲正站朋登的後面，連忙搶上一步，將朋登扶住了。朋登自己拿手擦着自己的額角。海特威看了她又驚駭，又憐惜，連忙說道：「你太累了。回家去休息休息吧。一朋登有氣無力地謝了一聲，就從割治室裏退了出來。舒樂絲心裏想着這件事有些蹊蹺，朋登將傢伙掉在地下，在一個緊急時候走開丨丨實是少有的奇事。她對海特威說道：「她剛才聽見了你說那病人瘋了，她就嚇得什麽似的。」海物威沉思着。他記得從前亦有一次，她帮助他治一個神經病的瘋人。她亦受有同樣的刺激的。這實在最件奇怪的事。　　朋登在醫院裏，仍舊往返奔波的忙碌着，而弗蘭克的散弟兩個人，像競賽似的爭相招呼她，使她忙得更是手脚不停。那裏還有一個將列的少年母親，旁邊放着一個垂危的小孩子。朋登一有些閒空，就去看那母子二人。這時海特威的手術已告成功，那個女子已淸醒了丨丨這使朋登臉上痛苦的痕跡，淡去了好多。可是康瑙萊又尋着了她，她正在烹調室裏預備一個病人的素餐。一朋，這是怎麽回事？難道你永久不要快樂的嗎？」他低着頭對了她，他的懇摯的眼光，尋覓着她的臉。「我們出去玩玩，可以有一個極快樂的時候，你和我兩個人！」他說完了，先將她纖白的手拉了起來，放在他自己的臉上拍着。</p>
<p>朋登道時低微笑着，竟放鬆了一切的提防，而康瑙萊伸手過來摟她纖腰的時候，她亦竟呆呆地看着他，沒有加以拒絶。一回兒他將她抱緊了，將嘴凑在她耳邊說道：「朋，你眞可愛極了，我爲你而瘋狂了！」朋登聽了他的話，不知不覺的舉起手來，撫摸着他的頭鬆。這時他們的臉，已偎得近近的，他們的唇，已越凑越近。突然間康瑙萊的臂將朋登抱得緊緊的，他的雙唇貼在她的嘴上，熱烈在吮着吻着。在這一霎時迷迷惘惘之中，朋登亦和他對吻着。但是一霎時過去了，他就立卽將他推開了。康瑙萊還竭力地和她爭持着，但是朋登一脫手就逃走了。她逃到窗戶口，顫動的手弄着窗帘。康瑙萊呆呆地看着她的後形，不敢追上去，但是她剛才不是她亦和他對吻的嗎，這樣他就鼓了餘勇跑上去丨丨他知道女子都是差不多的，總逃不出他的掌握的。他走上走輕輕用雙手搭在她的肩上，徐徐地將她轉了過來，他又將手指撥弄着她的下　，將她的臉提高了。然後看住了她的臉柔聲問她道：「朋，到底是怎麽回事？你不喜歡我嗎？（未完）</p>

<h3>Ariyoshi Calls on President Wang; Meeting Lasts One and a Half Hours; States Mission to Return to Japan and Opinions of Japanese Government and Opposition; No Discussion of Solutions to Sino-Japanese Issues</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Akira Ariyoshi, accompanied by Counselors Ariyoshi and Horiuchi, Secretary Yokokawa, and others, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 7th and immediately proceeded to the Japanese Consulate for rest. At 4 PM, Ariyoshi, accompanied by Ariyoshi, went to the No. 1 official residence of the Ministry of Railways to call on Wang, who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, for a discussion lasting one and a half hours, during which tea and refreshments were served. The Chinese side present at the time included Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Minister Tang, and Huang Chaoli, a secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who served as interpreter. Ariyoshi began by stating that upon his return to Japan, he would provide a detailed account of the situation in China to Foreign Minister Hirota. The Foreign Minister expressed his desire to break through the difficulties facing Sino-Japanese relations and proposed that China and Japan cooperate with each other. He then expressed the Japanese government's deep gratitude for the Chinese government's dispatch of the naval training fleet commander, Wang Shouting, to Japan to attend the funeral of Marshal Togo. Finally, he mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be holding a completion ceremony for its new building on the 8th and that he was honored to be invited and would attend on time. Wang responded that Foreign Minister Hirota's hope for Sino-Japanese cooperation was particularly appreciated, and he hoped that the principle of peace would be upheld. He added that Marshal Togo was truly a talent of East Asia, and that China and Japan, as neighbors, deeply mourned his passing. They then enjoyed tea and refreshments and exchanged pleasantries. Ariyoshi took his leave at 5:30 PM. Afterwards, reporters visited Tang Youren, who stated that Ariyoshi's visit to Wang was merely a routine meeting after returning to his post, and that issues such as railway and postal services were not mentioned. When Ariyoshi took his leave, he only mentioned that he would attend the completion ceremony of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' new building on the 8th and did not arrange a future meeting. Tang expressed that the public should be discerning regarding the various rumors circulating in recent days. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Counselor Ariyoshi of the Japanese Embassy stated that the Ambassador's visit was to call on Wang and attend the completion ceremony of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' new building. He would stay in Nanjing for two days and then return to Shanghai. After returning to Japan, the Ambassador had exchanged opinions on Sino-Japanese issues with leaders of the government and opposition parties in Japan. All parties had a good understanding of China, but there would be no change in policy towards China. He had not received any new instructions for this return to his post, so he had no special mission other than to convey the general opinions of his country. As for the negotiation of outstanding Sino-Japanese issues, the Ambassador, as the diplomatic envoy stationed in China, naturally had the responsibility to negotiate, but this depended on the attitude of the Chinese side. There were no preparations to raise negotiations this time. As for the issues of railway and postal services, he had said when he visited the Chinese authorities on his previous visit to Nanjing that they still needed to be considered. He might mention them on this visit to Nanjing, but how to resolve them would depend on the Chinese side's response. However, these issues were all local matters and could be resolved locally. He also stated that these matters were not proposed by the Japanese side, nor were they demanded by the Chinese side, but were a matter of factual need, so Japan was now awaiting China's response. The Ambassador had not met with Huang Fu in Shanghai. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Counselor Ariyoshi stated to reporters at the train station on the morning of the 7th that Ambassador Ariyoshi had recently returned to his post after a ten-day absence, so he had come to Nanjing specifically to visit President Wang to report on his return and to attend the banquet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 8th. He had no special mission. He would stay in Nanjing for about two days and then return to Shanghai. There were no plans to visit Chairman Chiang in Jiangxi or to go to Beiping in the near future. As for Ambassador Ariyoshi's recent return to Japan, he had reported on the situation in China and exchanged opinions on Sino-Japanese issues with the government and opposition parties in Japan, but there would be no change in policy towards China. He had not received any new instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs upon his return. There were many outstanding Sino-Japanese issues, and Ariyoshi, as the Japanese diplomatic representative in China, had the responsibility to negotiate, but there were no preparations to raise negotiations this time. Matters in North China, such as railway services, still awaited consideration by the Chinese side. At this point, someone asked about rumors of the resumption of the Sino-Japanese Exchange Bank and what the inside story was. He replied that he had heard nothing about it. Finally, he stated that Ariyoshi had not met with Huang Fu in Shanghai. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ariyoshi went to the No. 1 official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 4:30 PM to call on President Wang. Tang Youren was present, and Huang Chaoqin served as interpreter. He left after about an hour. Ariyoshi first stated that his return to Japan was to report on the situation in China to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He then stated the opinions of the Japanese government and opposition parties, as well as Hirota, on Sino-Japanese issues, expressing their great hope that China and Japan would cooperate with each other to maintain peace in East Asia. He did not mention any specific measures. He then represented the Japanese government in expressing gratitude for China's dispatch of a warship to Japan to attend Togo's funeral. Finally, he stated that he would attend the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' banquet tomorrow night on time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Arrive in Xinglong to Plan Gold Mine Exploitation; Forcing Original Mine Owners to Obtain Certificates from the Puppet Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet Ministry of Industry has sent personnel to build houses for the Xinglong Gold Mine Company in the Daodaoliushui and Xiaodaoliushui areas of Xinglong County. The company is scheduled to open on the first of next month. Mase Kiyoshiro, the puppet gold mine president, has arrived locally to plan everything. The puppet Ministry of Industry is forcing Zhao Guanbei, the original mine owner of the Daodaoliushui and Xiaodaoliushui gold bricks, to exchange his certificate for a certificate from the puppet ministry, and then allocate several square miles of mining area for the mine owner to mine himself, without incorporating it into the puppet gold mining company. (Special dispatch on the 7th) (Beiping) There is a rumor that a Japanese, Qingjiro, has been tasked with overseeing the mining of the Xinglong gold mine. According to relevant sources, the mine is privately owned and holds industrial certificates. However, the mining area is adjacent to the highway, so excavation has not been allowed from the beginning. After the end of the Great Wall War, the Japanese side did try to seize it, and indirectly instigated the holders of the mining rights to lower the price. After the county government noticed this, the matter was stopped. Recently, it has been confirmed that the rumor of the Japanese side planning to exploit the mine again is not true. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Contraband Salt Floods War Zones; Transported in Through Four Great Wall Passes</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet state's contraband salt is being imported into various counties in northern Hebei for dumping sales. There are four routes for transportation: Gubeikou, Malanyu, Lengkou, and Panjiakou. Transportation relies on Japanese military vehicles, and our anti-smuggling officers are unable to stop it. Zhu Langzhai, the chief inspector of anti-smuggling in eastern Tianjin-Yongqing, went to Saheqiao to meet with Captain Umezu, the Japanese military platoon leader, to negotiate the rampant smuggling of contraband salt in the war zone. Umezu stated that he would cooperate in suppressing the import of contraband salt within the scope of possibility.

<h3>Japanese Army in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Conscripts Carts</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, the order in various rural villages of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces has suddenly been greatly disrupted. This is because the Japanese army is conscripting laborers and carts to load military supplies and transport them to Rehe, western Liaoning, and various passes along the Great Wall. The puppet provincial government of Heilongjiang had previously issued an order to various counties, requiring them to conscript 1,600 carts within half a month, with each county being responsible for fifty or sixty carts. By this calculation, the number in Liaoning and Jilin provinces must be even more alarming. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>China Exchange Bank Has Not Yet Applied to Resume Business</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has not considered the issue of the China Exchange Bank resuming business because it has not received its application to resume business. However, according to the opinion of the responsible department, it is believed that if the bank is responsible for repaying its old debts, it would be welcome news to the creditors. However, this is an old debt issue, and the nature of future business is of great importance.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Right to Pilotage, Which is Related to National Defense, Should Be Maintained Urgently!</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Upon examining the treaties between China and foreign countries, the term "pilotage" first appeared in Article 1 of the Sino-British Trade Regulations for the Five Ports in the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843). The practice of foreigners hiring their own pilots was first established by Article 8 of the Sino-Swedish-Norwegian Treaty of the 27th year of Daoguang (1847). Subsequently, Article 17 of the Sino-American Treaty and Article 35 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty in the 8th year of Xianfeng (1858) also made similar provisions to indicate the intention of equal distribution of benefits. Moreover, Article 15 of the Sino-French Treaty of the same year went a step further, stating that "If anyone wants to become a pilot for Great France, if they have three shipowner licenses, the consular official can appoint them as a pilot," etc. Article 34 of the Sino-Italian Treaty in the 5th year of Tongzhi (1866) granted consular officials of various countries the power to jointly establish pilotage regulations. The other contracting countries separately cited the most-favored-nation treatment clauses and also had grounds for making similar claims.</p>
<p>The treaty basis for foreigners to control pilotage rights is no more than what has been stated. However, the most severe case of seizing our country's pilotage rights and creating a situation where guests dominated hosts was the Pilotage Regulations established by Robert Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, in the 6th year of Tongzhi (1867). Hart's Regulations both made pilotage rights public to the people of various contracting countries (Article 2) and revived the power of consular officials of various countries to formulate pilotage regulations, pilotage boundaries, pilotage quotas, and pilotage fees for each port (Article 1). The examination and selection of pilots was delegated to the Marine Department under the Customs (Article 3), and all the real power of the Marine Department was controlled by foreign Marine Surveyors. Consuls of various treaty countries and foreign pilot directors could assist in the examination and selection (Article 3), and consuls of various contracting countries had the right to supervise the examination (Article 4). All foreign pilots who had already obtained licenses could bring one apprentice each (Article 6) to practice, so that the deformed system of inverting authority could be passed down from teacher to apprentice forever.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Merchant Ship Driving Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilots Association, the Shipping Industry Association, and other organizations have been calling for the struggle for pilotage rights, sending letters and telegrams. Maintaining pilotage rights is related to our country's major national defense plans. At this time when foreign insults are increasing daily, the calls of the city merchants should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>The term "pilot" is called "水先人" (mizusaki-nin) in Japanese, meaning someone who leads ships in and out of a certain port as their exclusive duty. Therefore, any pilot must have a complete understanding of the navigation routes, waterways, and port regulations of a port. This is to ensure the safety of ships and is a heavy responsibility. However, since pilots must be familiar with the terrain and dangers within the port, for the sake of consolidating national defense, it should naturally be the responsibility of citizens of our own country. The laws of various countries have similar provisions stating that "absolutely no foreigners can engage in pilotage." Only in our country has the right to pilotage been lost along with the right to inland navigation. Once an international war occurs, we will inevitably suffer greatly. For example, during the Sino-French War in the 12th year of Guangxu (1886), French warships hired an American who was issued a license by our customs as a pilot to penetrate deeply into the Min River estuary, causing many of our warships to be bombed and sunk, and innocent people to die. Another example is the January 28th Incident, when Japanese warships entered and exited the ports of Shanghai and Wusong, transporting soldiers and weapons, all with the guidance of Japanese pilots licensed by our customs. Recalling this now, there is still lingering pain.</p>
<p>On March 5, 1931, the Examination Yuan of the National Government promulgated the Pilotage Examination Regulations, Article 1 of which stated, "No one may act as a pilot without holding a pilotage license issued by the Examination Yuan in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations." Article 2 further stipulated that those taking the pilotage examination must be citizens of the Republic of China. It can be seen that the authorities have the determination to recover pilotage rights. All Chinese people cannot help but be optimistic about its success. In September of last year, at the urging of the General Staff Headquarters, the National Government promulgated forty-six articles of the Provisional Regulations for Pilotage Management. Regarding pilotage affairs in Shanghai, it established a pilotage management committee to govern them. For a time, it was swift and vigorous, demonstrating the government's utmost intention to maintain national rights.</p>
<p>Foreign pilots have always been entrenched in Shanghai and Tianjin. After the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations, the consular bodies in both places were bound to raise objections. The reasons they hold will inevitably be nothing more than manipulating treaty clauses and Hart's Regulations, which we had long anticipated. Indeed, Corningham, the leading consul in Shanghai, repeatedly sent letters to the municipal government to negotiate. One was to say, "The Pilotage Regulations of the 7th year of Tongzhi were the result of bilateral agreement between China and so-and-so countries, not unilaterally promulgated by China." The second was to say, "The current pilotage rights are based on treaties. If there are any changes affecting the people of various countries, unless the other contracting party agrees, our colleagues will not be able to recognize them." However, they do not know that Hart was merely a Chinese official. The regulations he drafted were approved by the former Qing Zongli Yamen and then promulgated, and in fact had the nature of domestic laws. It is beyond reproach to change a previous order with a subsequent order. As to whether Hart negotiated with certain countries in his individual capacity, it is a trivial issue and has no bearing on the main issue. Even if the Zongli Yamen notified the foreign ministers after promulgating the regulations, it was only a routine procedure and cannot be forcibly construed as having the meaning of an international agreement. As for the meaning of the treaties concluded by the former Qing government with Britain, the United States, and other countries regarding pilotage, it was "only to allow foreign ships to enter and exit the five treaty ports for trade without hindrance in hiring pilots. The treaty articles concluded with France stated that consular officials could appoint anyone with three shipowner licenses as a pilot, etc. However, these articles were only to provide standards for selecting pilots in case it was impossible to hire them. All treaty articles were limited to the scope of facilitating the hiring of pilots for foreign ships. However, there are no specific articles regarding our government's management of pilots that would allow foreigners to participate in legislation." (Excerpt from the document from the Ministry of Navy to the Shanghai Municipal Government on April 4 of this year)</p>
<p>From this point of view, our country's recovery of the entire right to pilotage has no need to hesitate from either an emotional or rational standpoint. Moreover, regulations have already been promulgated, and credibility is at stake. How can we change our original intention due to external pressure? If friendly countries can set aside treaties and regulations and calmly consider the fact that their own countries respect pilotage sovereignty, they will know what the pain China has suffered in the past sixty or seventy years has been like. What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others. I sincerely hope that friendly countries will consider this. If it is said that the abandonment of pilotage rights cannot precede the right to inland navigation, it is enough to strengthen our determination to recover the right to inland navigation. To use this as an excuse for controlling pilotage rights is insufficient.</p>

<h3>Military Disarmament Conference Shifts Direction: Urging Germany to Return to Geneva; Britain, America, and France Hold Secret Talks on Steps; France and Germany Also Conduct Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Politicians from various countries are currently striving to urge Germany to return to Geneva, so that the endangered Disarmament Conference may avoid total collapse. The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, yesterday severely criticized the French representative for obstructing the assembly at the meeting of the main Disarmament committee chairs. Due to this change in French policy, there was an invitation for Germany to return to the Disarmament Conference. Henderson proposed two solutions to the French delegation: either the French representative propose a suggestion acceptable to the assembly, or they must bear full responsibility for destroying the assembly. The French delegation hurriedly completed a compromise proposal this morning, which was presented by Barthou at the main committee meeting held at 2:00 PM today. The French Foreign Minister then delivered a speech, inviting Germany to return to Geneva, and cited the points in his compromise proposal, stating that informal negotiations might lead to the final victory of the Disarmament Conference. The French Foreign Minister explained this as meaning that any government may hold any negotiations with any country, which in other words means Germany. Germany must participate in any treaty concluded here, but they do not believe the conference cannot proceed without Germany. However, the door must be wide open, and Germany can enter this door on an equal footing, but they must still share the responsibilities borne by other countries. After Barthou presented the compromise proposal, the main committee adjourned until 10:30 AM on Friday. The General Committee is scheduled to meet at 2:45 PM that afternoon. The leaders attending the meeting immediately began working to promote Germany's return to the Disarmament Conference. Representatives from France, Britain, and the United States held a secret meeting at the residence of the American representative, Davis, tonight to discuss ways to get Germany to return to the Disarmament Conference. On the other hand, Barthou told French reporters that he had met with German special envoy Rauschnig in Geneva on Thursday, and the content was of great importance to the future and had an impact on the Saar issue. It is also known here that the French ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, is also in Berlin negotiating with the German government on the issue of returning to the Disarmament Conference and inviting Germany to join the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact.

<h3>Franco-German Negotiations: Hitler Develops Good Feelings; General Opinion Believes the Situation Remains Bleak</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After French Foreign Minister Barthou submitted his resolution to replace the proposal of the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, the main Disarmament committee decided this afternoon to postpone the meeting until Friday so that representatives can study it calmly. The main committee will meet on Friday morning, and the General Committee will meet that afternoon. As for today's meeting, it was of little interest, because what was discussed was almost entirely procedural issues. Barthou claimed that although no country welcomes Germany's return more than France, the French representatives do not hold the opinion that affairs will be unable to continue without Germany. When the main committee adjourned, the general opinion in the audience was that the situation remains bleak and there has been no progress. Barthou announced tonight that last week he had a long conversation with Baron Rauschnig, representative of German Vice-Chancellor Papen, involving the Saar and other issues. It is reported that this conversation has aroused good feelings from German Chancellor Hitler, who said that the French government has shown a moderate and wise spirit regarding the Saar issue. According to Barthou's resolution, the Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference should study the internationalization of civil aviation, the abolition of aerial bombardment, and the reduction of air forces. The Disarmament Conference will continue to work along the outlines of the Soviet and Polish representatives' proposals, but the French proposal has not eased the situation, because the representatives of the United States, Britain, and Italy do not consider its terms satisfactory. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The main committee of the Disarmament Conference continued its meeting at 3:30 PM today, but the representatives all held a very pessimistic attitude, and the first item on the agenda was to consider the motion proposed by France. The motion stated that "the General Committee requests the chairman to first consider the proposal put forward by Soviet Russia, namely that the Disarmament Conference should automatically declare that it will permanently exist in the name of a peaceful conference." Furthermore, the Secretariat of the League of Nations will subsequently publish the contents of today's meeting, including the section of the French Foreign Minister Barthou's declaration regarding Germany's return to the League of Nations. Barthou's declaration stated: "Germany's return to the League of Nations has been pending for a long time, which is a major obstacle to the work of the conference, and France welcomes Germany's return the most. The gates of Geneva must be wide open, with no door closed, and Germany can freely join with completely equal rights and obligations." However, the French delegation issued another declaration tonight, in which this section was not included. However, the news released by the League of Nations was extracted from the French shorthand record, so there is no doubt that Barthou made this statement. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When French Foreign Minister Barthou negotiated the Saar issue with German representative Rösner in Geneva last week, the discussion was not limited to the Saar vote. The current situation and future prospects of Franco-German relations were also discussed. Geneva political figures believe that although this meeting cannot determine that Germany will soon return to the League of Nations, judging from Barthou's recent declarations involving Germany, it seems to be a good sign. Barthou's remarks are generally regarded as consistent with France's past documents on disarmament issues, and facilitate Germany's return to Geneva. The realization of this matter is what all countries hope for. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>American, British, and French Representatives Conduct Private Talks: Seeking a Compromise Outside the Conference</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After yesterday's Disarmament Presidium meeting, representatives of major countries, such as the American representative Davis, the British representative Eden, and the French representative Massigli, agreed to seek a compromise through private talks so that the opinions of the major countries can converge when the General Committee meets. The first private conversation was held last night. The impression gained was not excessively unpleasant. Representatives of Britain and the United States both requested a considerable amount of time to consult with their respective governments. If the replies from the governments concerned can be sent today, private consultations may be held again in the evening. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) (Disarmament Conference) The American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, received the French Minister of the Navy, Piétri, and the British representative, Eden, today for lunch. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Although most newspapers published news of improved atmosphere in Geneva, the Times correspondent in Geneva reported that the British delegation did not believe that Barthou's recent proposals had made any progress. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Henderson Advocates Convening a League of Nations General Assembly: The Current Situation is Perilous, Disarmament is Pessimistic</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Henderson stated this morning that unless the main committee of the Disarmament Conference can reach an agreement on the agenda, the Disarmament Conference will be unable to continue. Henderson also declared while talking to the leaders of various delegations that they really see the necessity of convening a League of Nations General Assembly, given the dangers of the current situation, and will report to the General Assembly that all efforts have failed one by one, and it is impossible to reach any agreement. Therefore, the Disarmament Conference should be disbanded immediately. It is said that since all countries are unwilling to bear the responsibility for the failure of the conference, the main committee may reach an understanding at the last minute, but under the current circumstances, this hope is still very slim, and under the current state of the main committee, today's afternoon meeting may not be held. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>The US Holds a Detached Attitude on Disarmament and Naval Issues, Not Taking Sides Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>(Washington) Local newspapers published news from Paris stating that in the Disarmament Conference, the United States and Britain are joining hands to oppose the claims of France and some other countries. Today, Secretary of State Hull issued a correction to the press, saying that the United States has not agreed on joint action with Britain or any other country on disarmament and naval issues. The U.S. government has instructed the U.S. representative Davis to strictly maintain a fair and impartial attitude. According to news from Geneva published in the American newspapers, it makes readers suspect that Davis is assisting British views and fiercely criticizing France's position. The above declaration by the State Department has corrected this impression. Although the security claims of France and most other delegations have been attacked, the U.S. government does not admit that it participated in the attack. This can be seen from the State Department's correction. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>The French Chamber of Deputies Discusses Expanding Military Expenditures; Pétain Explains Germany's Expansion of Military Police</h3>
<p>(Paris) On March 10 of this year, the government submitted a draft law to the Chamber of Deputies, requesting the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to spend the following expenses: (1) The Army Department spent 1,175,000,000 francs to complete border defense projects; (2) The Navy Department spent 825,000,000 francs to build liquid fuel storage tanks, organize coastal defense projects, and naval aviation; (3) The Aviation Department spent 980,000,000 francs to reorganize the Air Force. The above expenses totaled 2,980,000,000 francs and would be used up in five years. Later, because the border defense project was to be completed quickly, and construction encountered difficulties from time to time, the estimated expenses had to be slightly increased, so the total reached 3,120,000,000 francs. Recently, the ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force attended the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies one after another to explain, and today the Finance Committee passed all national defense expenditures by a vote of 22 to 10. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) General Pétain, Minister of the Army, and General Colson, Deputy Chief of Staff, attended the Army Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today and gave a precise explanation of the large-scale expansion of the German army and police force. General Pétain first said that military groups other than the German regular army are very active. Germany has now established military aviation, and the manufacture of ordnance is also very developed. Finally, he also made some explanations on the economic and spiritual conditions of the German nation. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of the Interior Sarraut announced to the cabinet meeting today that the French people are increasingly afraid of air raids and the spread of poison gas. Sarraut therefore suggested planning measures for the people's defense against air raids, which was approved by the cabinet and submitted to the parliament for discussion. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Education Minister Comments on Disarmament: France Should Bear the Responsibility for Destruction; Woe to Those Who Are Enemies with Germany</h3>
<p>(London) The Archbishop of Canterbury declared today that France should bear most of the responsibility for the failure of the Geneva disarmament talks. If the Disarmament Conference completely fails, Germany will definitely take the path of military armament due to France's suspicion. The Archbishop expressed regret for the attitude of French Foreign Minister Barthou in Geneva, and said that those who want to be enemies with Germany for generations are in great danger, which is the basic common sense of politicians. If France repeatedly rejects Germany's most reasonable suggestions, this feud will fall into a situation of eternal damnation. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>US Navy Department Approves a $90 Million Shipbuilding Plan; Swanson Reiterates Statement on Naval Treaties: Only Mutual Reduction of Tonnage is Allowed, Not Changes in Ratios; Japanese Newspapers Promote the Idea of Coordinated Action Between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson today approved a shipbuilding plan of 90 million U.S. dollars to complete the naval strength permitted by the London Treaty. The plan includes one heavy cruiser and three 10,000-ton light cruisers, costing 50 million U.S. dollars, which has been approved by Congress and allocated in the official budget of the Navy Department. In addition, it is also necessary to immediately build twelve destroyers, two destroyer leaders, and six submarines, costing 40 million U.S. dollars, which is allocated by the Public Works Administration and approved by the Vinson Act. When announcing the plan, Secretary Swanson also expressed his views on naval treaties, saying that unless other countries are willing to relatively reduce tonnage, the United States will never allow changes in the ratio set by the London Treaty. Swanson stated that the opinions of Britain and the United States on warship issues may be slightly different, and the United States believes that warships are the backbone of the navy, which means that the United States will oppose Britain's proposal to reduce the number and tonnage of battleships. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's newspapers reported that Britain and the United States are now conspiring to take joint action against Japan in the future naval conference, which is not believed by political circles here. Japan has accepted Britain's proposal to conduct preliminary talks before the 1935 naval conference. It is now known that Britain, the United States, and Japan will hold talks in London through diplomatic channels. At the same time, Japanese diplomatic representatives outside London may also conduct preliminary talks with the governments of their host countries. It is heard that these preliminary talks will be conducted separately by the countries concerned, which is very free. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan Purchases a Large Batch of Bauxite from the Dutch East Indies for the Construction of the Air Force; The Contract Cannot Proceed Due to Transport Issues</h3>
<p>A Japanese company operating an aluminum plant in Taiwan recently concluded a contract with a company in the Dutch East Indies to purchase 24,000 tons of bauxite annually. The contract cannot proceed because the opinions of the two governments differ. The Japanese government insists that the goods be transported by Japanese ships, while the Dutch East Indies government wants them to be transported by Dutch ships. The two sides are at odds over this transportation issue. Japan's purchase of a large batch of bauxite from the Dutch East Indies is aimed at building the air force without relying on supplies from the United States. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Another Scene in the Puppet Show: Prince Chichibu Pays Homage to the Puppet Emperor</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Prince Chichibu paid homage to Puyi at 9:50 this morning, presenting the Japanese Emperor's autograph and medal, and celebrating the implementation of the imperial system. Puyi expressed his gratitude for the cordial friendship of the Japanese Imperial Family and expressed his sympathy for Prince Chichibu's long journey. The ceremony ended at 10:25, and Prince Chichibu returned to his residence. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The special envoy Prince Chichibu paid homage to the puppet emperor of Manchukuo today, presenting an autograph and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum. Tomorrow, he will participate in the "Manchukuo" joint military parade. Until the 12th, he will attend various Japanese and "Manchu" welcoming parties. He will depart Changchun on the morning of the 13th, arrive in Shenyang that day, stay for one day on the 14th, and depart Shenyang for Dalian on the 15th. He will depart from Dalian that day and return home. (Dentsu, 7th)</p>
<h3>International Committee to Discuss El Salvador's Recognition of the Puppet State: El Salvador Replies to the League of Nations, Explaining the Reasons</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is now known that El Salvador replied to the League of Nations today, explaining the reasons for its formal recognition of "Manchukuo," stating that recognition is the inherent right of a sovereign state. El Salvador's recognition of "Manchukuo" is an act that undermines the great powers' joint front against Manchuria. This matter will be discussed by the Chinese Advisory Committee, and a very complicated and serious situation may occur, because El Salvador's move may lead to the failure of the opium import license ban imposed on Manchuria. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) At a meeting in the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Viscountess Astor expressed concern about the increasing opium imports into "Manchukuo." Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he believed it was unlikely that any was imported. Information of a non-confidential nature from the diplomatic representative stationed in Manchuria concerning the opium situation will be published in a report issued by the League of Nations. Simon also said that we are now working with other countries and the League of Nations to deal with the opium trade. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Cabinet Resigns</h3>
<p>The Belgian Chamber of Representatives today rejected two bills: one to subsidize families with too many children and the other to crack down on foreign residents. The cabinet held a meeting at 6:00 PM in the evening, and as a result, Prime Minister de Broqueville submitted his resignation on behalf of the entire cabinet to King Leopold III. The political situation in Belgium has been unstable for more than a day, but people did not expect the political turmoil to happen so quickly. When the Chamber of Representatives discussed the two bills, the socialist MPs voted against the government's proposed amount of subsidies for families with too many children, considering it insufficient, and for other reasons. However, the liberals held the opposite view, believing that the government's bill would increase the budget, so they also voted against it. The bill to crack down on foreign residents was intended to make it easier for the government to deport some foreign residents, but the socialists believed it violated the principle of freedom of rights, and the bill was eventually rejected by a vote of 80 to 74.

<h3>Corruption is Never Forgiven: Seven Senior Russian Officials Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Seven senior Soviet Russian officials who were escorted from the Kyiv area were executed by firing squad this morning. This death penalty was sentenced by the Soviet Central Revolutionary Court, and their crimes were corruption, dereliction of duty, and infringement of national interests. Fifty more Ukrainian officials will be tried this week. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Droughts in Both America and Russia Cause Disasters</h3>
<p>News from Warsaw and Moscow said that the most fertile provinces of Soviet Russia have been suffering from a long drought, causing a strange disaster. Ukraine lacks rain and is also suffering from insect pests, so sugar beets have been severely damaged. The Don region authorities are now using aircraft to spray venom to eliminate grasshoppers, which are gathering in northern Ukraine and Belarus and spreading towards the Polish border. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The harvest of wheat in the Midwestern states of the United States has been greatly reduced due to the impact of the drought, which will be the lowest amount in about twenty-five years. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Lithuania Suddenly Launches a Coup: Soldiers Occupy Government Agencies; Former Prime Minister Elected as Leader; But Officials Say the Situation is Not Serious</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is learned here that a revolution has occurred in Lithuania. It is reported that the capital, Kaunas, has fallen into the hands of warlords, with former Prime Minister Valdemaras as the leader. The military coup occurred on Tuesday morning. According to news from the East Prussian border, troops have occupied government agencies, but civil servants are still loyal to the government. Telegrams received by Berlin newspapers stated that after Mr. Valdemaras arrived in the capital by plane, he sent an ultimatum to President Smetona. It is reported that the governor of the Memel region and several cabinet members have been arrested, but it has not yet been confirmed. It is also heard that the troops have withdrawn from various streets, and the situation has gradually calmed down. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to a telegram received by the German News Agency from the city of Tilsit, a military coup was planned by the party members of former Prime Minister Tilitas Moraas, which broke out in Jia'en last night. Valdemaras appointed himself as the Prime Minister and set up an office in the capital's General Staff. The overall situation is now under the control of the army rebels, sending an ultimatum to President Smethona, but the President refused to negotiate with the rebels. National order is currently safe. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Lithuanian Embassy in London officially announced today that the coup in the capital is not considered significant. A Lithuanian embassy statement said, "This morning, the defense forces were conducting exercises. There was a misunderstanding and gunfire occurred. There were no deaths or injuries. An investigation is currently being conducted into the responsible military forces." (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, the Lithuanian Minister of National Defense telegraphed the Associated Press in Berlin, saying that former Prime Minister Valdemaras had attempted to overthrow the government with troops this morning, but it was discovered in advance and his strength was insufficient, and has now failed.

<h3>Finance Minister's Determination to Resign is Firm; Saito Cabinet Will Definitely Fall; Seiyukai Seizes the Opportunity to Plan; Minseito Watches the Trend Quietly</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is almost certain that Finance Minister Takahashi will take the blame and resign when the truth about the Kuroda incident is revealed. The current cabinet is maintained by the three key figures of Takahashi, Saito, and Yamamoto, so if the Finance Minister resigns, the cabinet will also have to resign en masse. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Saito Cabinet decided to resign, various factions in the political arena became increasingly blatant in their efforts to gain power. The Seiyukai is aiming for the next cabinet, and is not lagging behind. As a result, a consensus on party unity has suddenly emerged recently. President Suzuki met with Mr. Kuhara the other day, and visited advisors Hatoyama and Tokonami on the afternoon of the 6th, vigorously advocating the need to unify the party. However, the internal affairs of the Seiyukai are quite complicated, and it is doubtful whether its unification undertaking can be easily realized. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The state funeral of the late Marshal Togo has now been completed, and the political situation is about to unfold. The attitude of the Minseito is very cautious, but it is planning countermeasures. Some in the party even advocate a tough stance, saying that if the government pretends to observe quietly, intending to continue its term, or resigns once and expects another mandate, the political responsibility of the current cabinet should be questioned for a certain incident, and cut off ties with the current cabinet. However, the intention of the party's executives is to be sure that the current cabinet will have to resign en masse due to the progress of a certain incident, so the Minseito avoids ineffective actions and decides to temporarily watch the trend of the political situation.

<h3>Netherlands-Japan Trade Talks Begin Today: Many Waves Ahead; Japan Demands Open Publicity for Propaganda; Determined to Achieve Goals</h3>
<p>Batavia's representative Nagaoka, Yangke Ranleff, the Governor-General of Dutch East Indies, and three others sat down at 11 a.m. on the 6th to contact Japanese-Dutch trade negotiations in French. Nagaoka explained Japan's position in detail, and presented the specific guidelines for the meeting. The Dutch East Indies also openly talked for more than an hour. As a result, it was decided that the first formal meeting would be held on the 8th, but it was only an opening ceremony, and the discussion of actual issues such as discussion methods and agendas would require informal communication and consultation between the Japanese and Dutch delegation. Therefore, it will take considerable time to reach the second consultation, and the future is expected to be wavy. (Dentsu, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Japanese sources, the Netherlands-Japan meeting is scheduled to be held in Batavia at 11:00 a.m. on the 8th. The Japanese side requested the Dutch governor that the meeting should take the form of public publicity, using the opportunity of discussion to preach to the Dutch indigenous people, advocating the opposition of the literati and the Dutch, in order to gain the benefits of the fisherman. It is heard that the purpose of the Japanese side in this meeting is to request the Dutch side to cancel the temporary import restriction order, in order to promote the sale of Japanese goods.

<h3>Japanese Goods Dumping Everywhere, U.S. Commerce Affected, Still Maintains Superior Position in China</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Department of Commerce recently released its annual report on global economic issues for 1933. The report states that last year, Japan's exports to Latin America, the Philippine Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, Africa, the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Sweden, and Spain increased significantly. The United States' exports, on the other hand, decreased due to competition from Japanese goods. However, this was not the case in China, where the United States was still able to maintain its superior position in trade. Last year, Japan's exports to Latin America totaled ¥30,397,000, compared to only ¥13,133,000 in 1932. Japan's exports to the United States also increased by 105%, including items such as light bulbs, oilcloth, ceramics, rubber shoes, matches, pencils, and certain canned goods, which were originally manufactured in the United States but are now being imported from Japan. The decrease in U.S. exports to the Philippines is due to the fact that cotton textiles sold in the Philippines were previously dominated by U.S. goods, but are now gradually being taken over by Japan. Also, last year Japan's exports to China were affected by boycotts, falling from 13.95% to 9.71% of total trade. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Tariff Bill Passed by Congress, Sent to White House for Approval, Authorizes President to Conclude Reciprocal Trade Agreements with Various Countries, Specifically Stipulates No Concessions on War Debts</h3>
<p>(Washington) The congressional procedures for the tariff bill have now been completed, so the bill was sent to the White House today for presidential approval. The bill allows the President to negotiate trade agreements with foreign countries, increasing or decreasing current tariff rates by up to 50%. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Reciprocal Tariff Act was passed in its entirety by Congress today. The Senate's proposed amendment was accepted by the House of Representatives by a vote of 154 to 52. The Senate's amendment consists of two points: that the conclusion of commercial treaties with other countries be limited to three years, and that relevant industries be notified in advance when modifying import tariffs. Observers here believe that the recent war debt situation may undermine the purpose of the bill, as debtor nations may demand concessions on war debts when discussing reciprocal trade agreements. However, the bill specifically stipulates that war debts may not be cancelled or reduced. The President can only do the following three things:</p>
<p>(1) Conclude commercial treaties with foreign governments. (2) Change current tariff rates by up to 50% or other import regulations. (3) The President may not change duty-free goods to taxable goods, or taxable goods to duty-free, but may recommend amendments to Congress. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) As President Roosevelt awaits Congress to grant him full power to negotiate reciprocal tariffs, more than ten countries competing with the United States in trade have negotiated preferential trade agreements with France, severely impacting U.S. exports and allowing French goods to enter the U.S. market to compete with American goods. The Franco-Brazilian trade agreement favors the import of fresh oranges from Brazil into France, thereby greatly affecting fresh oranges from Florida and California. Brazil has enacted preferential tariff rates for French textiles and other manufactured goods, resulting in a significant reduction in the import of textiles from New England and the southern states of the United States into Brazil. France has also concluded a trade agreement with Greece, stipulating that France must purchase at least 10,000,000 francs worth of Greek tobacco before May 30, 1935. This move will reduce tobacco exports from Fuller and Carolina. France is also granting Greece a preferential allocation for fresh fruit, which will negatively affect Pacific export fruit merchants. France has also newly signed a trade agreement with Portugal, reducing tariffs on canned sardines imported from Portugal to compete with canned fish from California. Portugal, in turn, is reducing surcharges on French medicines, automobiles, textiles, etc. The United States also imports these goods into Portugal. California is also heavily affected by the loss from the Franco-Spanish trade agreement, which favors the import of Spanish fruits and canned fish into France. The most significant impact on U.S. commerce is France's reduction of import duties to favor certain countries. These tariffs are 2% for raw materials, 4% for semi-finished goods, and 6% for manufactured goods. According to recently signed trade agreements, France has cancelled the 6% and 4% import duties on goods imported from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, and Luxembourg. Belgium and Italy already enjoy this right. This move is tantamount to stating that the above six countries only need to pay a 2% tariff on goods shipped into France, while U.S. manufactured goods must pay a 4% or 6% tariff. France's reduction of copper tariffs favors Belgium, threatening the copper-producing states of the western United States. The United States imports approximately $5 million to $10 million worth of copper into France each year. Copper imported from Belgium into France only needs to pay a 2% tariff, while the United States must pay 4%. U.S. commerce is most severely affected by France's reduction of tariffs on British imports, as the United Kingdom and the United States compete fiercely in the French market. French importers hope that President Roosevelt will use the power granted by the Senate to promptly sign a reciprocal trade agreement with France, and say that if the United States can show slight concessions, France is very willing to reduce import duties on U.S. goods. The French government has long had the dictatorial power to change tariff rates, so direct commercial negotiations between France and the United States should be concluded quickly.

<h3>Currency Reform Bill Introduced in Both Houses</h3>
<p>(Washington) A currency reform bill was simultaneously introduced in both houses of Congress today, which is more radical in nature than any plan previously proposed. The bill was introduced by radical Republican Senator Keppell in the Senate and Democratic Representative Burtman in the House. It proposes the establishment of a Federal Currency Commission, consisting of seven members, to control all of the United States' currency and banking organizations. The commission would have full authority to handle the following matters: (1) minting coins, (2) issuing currency, (3) regulating the banking system, (4) regulating the United States' purchasing power and maintaining the 1926 unemployment equilibrium, (5) buying and selling gold and silver domestically and internationally, and (6) recovering currency through international gold and silver trade methods.</p>
<p>The bill also orders the Secretary of the Treasury to immediately take over the national Federal Reserve Banks and transfer them to the Currency Commission for management. All of the above management powers, which currently belong to the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and other government agencies, will be completely transferred to the new commission. After the bill was introduced, the silver bill to be discussed in the Senate seemed slightly affected. The silver bill has already been started for discussion by Democratic Senator Pittman. Pittman has explained that the purpose of the bill is to restore silver to its monetary status and raise the price of silver. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The newly proposed currency reform bill and the criticism of the government's silver bill are the key issues in Congress today. Both houses of Congress are extending the session in the hope of passing a satisfactory currency bill before adjournment. Senator Thomas, a major silver advocate, was the first to attack the government's proposed plan today, even calling it the worst silver bill in years, urging the Senate to pass an amendment to change the permissive provisions to mandatory provisions. Thomas said that all the powers granted to the President in the current silver bill have already been granted by Congress, but the President was unwilling to exercise them before. Thomas also said that the Department of the Treasury has withdrawn currency from circulation in the past year, resulting in tight money conditions. For example, on March 9, 1933, there was $7,538 million in currency in circulation, while last week there was only $5,338 million. According to well-informed sources, it is expected that the silver bill will pass the Senate without amendment because any amendment opposed by the government will fail. There are already two types of amendments proposed: (1) to make silver the main currency, (2) to change the clause that allows the issuance of silver certificates to purchase silver backing up to 25% to a mandatory provision. In addition, there is also an amendment to repeal the 50% profit tax, which will also be proposed. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Management Act Established, Five-Member Committee Formed to Handle It</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Securities Exchange Management Act was passed by the House of Representatives on May 4th, and passed by the Senate on May 12th. It was signed into effect by President Roosevelt today. When the two houses held a joint review conference, President Roosevelt approved the central organization of the Commercial Committee to manage the authority. Therefore, the differences between the two houses on this case were harmonized. This case authorizes the committee to manage the operation of the exchange. This committee will be composed of three Democrats and two Republicans, whose characters are appointed by the president and Congress approves them. As for the management of margin and credit, it is controlled by the Federal Reserve Board, which can decide whether the margin standard should be 50% of the current market price or 100% of the lowest market price in the past three years, but in any case, it must not exceed 75% of the current market price. The provisions regarding securities registration will be implemented from July 1st, and the margin provisions will be handled from October 1st. However, the existing paid margin remains unchanged before January 1, 1937. In terms of the current market situation, the new provisions of this case are more concessions than the existing regulations of the securities exchange. Bank Street was quite pessimistic about the implementation of this case before, but now the concept has changed for the better. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Ugaki Meets with Minister of Army, Discusses Korean Policy, Decides to Increase Troops to Defend Against Russia, Talks Did Not Cover Political Situation</h3>

<p>(1) Governor Ugaki and Goto discussed countermeasures for Korean rice. Ugaki advocated easing the Korean rice policy, while Goto advocated changing the crop to cotton. (2) Governor Ugaki discussed with Minister Hayashi the increase of troops. Ugaki said that increasing troops could suppress the anti-Japanese sentiments of Koreans and could also defend against Russia's invasion of Korea. Many Korean youths are bewitched by Red Russia. If heavy troops are stationed in Korea, Russia would not dare to act rashly, and the anti-Japanese sentiments of Korean youths could also be reduced. Minister Hayashi agreed with his proposal, but the timing of the implementation has not been determined. (3) Governor Ugaki discussed Korean countermeasures with Minister Yamamoto, discussing the crackdown on Korean residents in Japan. They should establish close communication to prevent anomalies. (China United Electric, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 2:15 PM today, Ugaki, the Governor of Korea, visited Minister Hayashi at the Ministry of Army's official residence to report on (1) the current situation in Korea. If only the current Korean army is still worried that the defense is insufficient, so there is a need to increase it. The three-division system previously planned must be enriched by two divisions. (1) Korea's national defense resources must be noted, especially the Ranam iron ore, which contains hundreds of millions of tons. There are also many other development targets. (1) Although there is opposition to the emigration of Koreans to Manchuria, the Governor's Office plans to set up a guidance immigration agency, and will continue immigration in the future, so please understand and find a way.</p>
<h3>Minister Hayashi Replied</h3>
<p>(1) The increase in security forces in Korea is considered necessary, but the current situation in Manchuria where security is weak and its costs must be considered, so a clear answer cannot be given immediately.</p>
<p>(1) The development of national defense resources is certainly necessary, but it may be difficult to implement immediately.</p>
<p>(1) As for group immigration to Manchuria, we will do our best and will not hesitate to help.</p>
<p>There was no mention of political issues and he left at 55 minutes. At 3 pm, Governor Ugaki visited Minister Yamamoto again to discuss issues such as the immigration of Koreans to Manchuria for about an hour before leaving. (Dentsu Electric, 7th)</p>
<h3>Activities of the Japanese Communist Party</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Communist Party has been subjected to a major crackdown by the police authorities, causing its organ, the "Akahata," to be in a position where it cannot be published again, and can be said to be completely destroyed.

<h3>Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun Comments on Investment in China by Five Countries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun criticized the investment in China by various countries. The newspaper published an editorial today saying that according to recent news, representatives from five countries, including Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and Italy, have organized an investment group in China in Shanghai and plan to invest in various businesses in China through silver companies. If this is true, then what is the relationship between this new consortium and the four-nation loan consortium that has been responsible for aid to China? Moreover, although the establishment of silver companies has nothing to do with the League of Nations' technical assistance, what impact will it have on China's internal affairs to attract foreign investment while excluding Japan? All of this is worrying. At the thought of this, we must absolutely oppose the investment of the new consortium. To truly seek the economic revitalization of China, the reorganization of China's old debts by various countries is a prerequisite. Dentsu Electric, 7th</p>

<h3>Puppet Organization Builds Huludao, Japan Instigates Puppet Railway Bureau to Actively Proceed</h3>
<p>Liaoning correspondence: The importance of Huludao, located in western Liaoning and opposite Yingkou, as well as its economic value, is well known to Chinese people. Before the incident, the Northeast authorities signed a construction contract with the Dutch Harbor Construction Company at a cost of 6.4 million US dollars and started building the island. Unexpectedly, this large-scale project was suspended shortly after construction began due to the incident. After the company personnel left one after another last autumn, it became almost a completely dead port. Recently, the Japanese believed that the island is of great importance to the development of industry and culture in western Liaoning and Rehe, and is also a training port for the Rehe Railway. Most importantly, after the port is built, it can compete with Tianjin Port. With these factors, they believe that the port must be built. Therefore, the Japanese instigated the puppet Railway Bureau to start construction, and the bureau is now actively proceeding. Furthermore, the Western Shipping Company, which operates scheduled voyages between Dalian and Huludao, is eagerly awaiting the completion of the port to facilitate its business. Therefore, as an emergency measure, starting from June 1st, they extended and repaired the completed trestle bridge and the road inside the ditch, and deployed station staff and stevedores. In addition, they also plan to build a railway from Jinzhou to Huludao. According to the person in charge of the puppet bureau, after the port is built, not only can large ships enter and exit at will, but also coastal trading sailing ships will gather. Therefore, the prosperity of the port is immeasurable, and it will undoubtedly become the distribution port of western Liaoning in the future. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Anqin Arrives in Jiangxi to Meet Chiang, Reports on Political and Religious Situation in Tibet, Negotiates Measures for Panchen Lama to Return to Tibet</h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Anqin Lama, Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Chen Bingguang, member, and Luo Youren, director, and Wang Luojie, secretary, arrived in the province on the express train from Nanchang-Xunyang Road at 12:30 pm on the 4th. Cai Jingjun, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Xingying, and Wang Yi, Chief of the Public Relations Section, welcomed and took care of them at the station. After crossing the river and entering the city, An and his party stayed at the Garden Hotel. An's visit was to report to Chairman Chiang on all aspects of the political and religious customs in Tibet, and to request instructions on all measures for the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet, pacify Tibetan people, and consolidate border defenses. Chiang is scheduled to meet with them at his official residence on the morning of the 6th for lengthy consultations. According to Anqin, Tibet is located in a remote border area, and transportation is difficult, which inevitably leads to estrangement. In the past, Tibetan people often mistakenly believed that the National Government had abolished religion. However, freedom of religion is enshrined in the constitution. This time, the central government's outreach to Tibet will distribute items to temples and explain that the central government allows freedom of religion and equality for all, which is deeply appreciated by the Tibetan people. All parts of Tibet are currently peaceful. However, the Dalai Lama has passed away, and there is no leader. They have specially welcomed the Panchen Lama back to Tibet to preside. The Panchen Lama has expressed his willingness to return to Tibet in accordance with the central government's wishes. In addition to requesting instructions on all measures for the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet and eliminate conflicts in Kang and Tibet, Shi Qingyang will also report on the situation of Inner Mongolian autonomy and Mongolian-Tibetan border defenses. An and his party will return to Nanjing after meeting Chiang and completing consultations. The exact date of the Panchen Lama's arrival in Jiangxi is not yet confirmed. (5th)</p>

<h3>Reuter's Special Business Intelligence Telegram, June 7th - Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>London Gold Price: The gold price in London today is 137 shillings and 1.5 pence, down 9 pence from yesterday.</p>
<p>London Silver: In the London silver market, the spot price today is 19.75 pence, down 0.0625, and the futures price is also 19.75 pence, down 0.125. There was little trading this morning, with India and the United States buying and China selling.</p>
<p>New York Silver: The New York silver market opened quietly, with mixed sentiments, awaiting the final developments in the silver legislation debate. The opening price for forward contracts was down 3 to 7 pounds sterling from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Bombay Silver: The Bombay silver market closed stable today. The spot price was down 4 annas, at 55 rupees and 2 annas. Futures prices were also down 4 annas.</p>
<p>London Special Report: In today's (7th) London gold and silver market, the transaction value of gold exceeded one million pounds sterling. The price was 137 shillings and 1.5 pence, and the US dollar exchange rate was 5.0675 yuan. This gold was apparently purchased by the United States with the Exchange Stabilization Fund in order to curb the sharp rise of the US dollar. After this large gold transaction, many US dollars were sold, so the price of the British pound against the franc and the US dollar also improved, and the French-American exchange rate also fell below the cash export point. Therefore, the trend of gold flowing from Paris to the United States may be temporarily stopped. Today's sale of gold was due to a special commission from a certain party, but it is difficult to ascertain which country the certain party belongs to. According to a certain broker, this is German gold bullion. This statement is close to the truth, because between May 31st and June 4th, Germany shipped out approximately one million pounds sterling worth of gold.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>British-American: In the London foreign exchange market today, the British pound exchange rate has improved because the United States purchased a large amount of gold and sold US dollars with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The opening price of the British pound against the US dollar was 5.07 yuan, up 0.0125 from yesterday's closing price. The price fluctuated slightly in the morning, and the price at 3:00 PM was still 5.07 yuan, the same as the opening price. Also, one US dollar is equivalent to 3 shillings, 11 and 0.3489 pence in British gold.</p>
<p>British-French: The opening price was 76.62 francs, lower than yesterday's closing price by 3 pounds sterling. The exchange rate soon recovered, and the price at 3:00 PM was 76.78 francs, up 16 pounds sterling from the opening price.</p>
<p>American-British: The opening price of the New York exchange rate for the British pound against the US dollar today was 5.07125 yuan, 0.0025 higher than yesterday's closing price. It fell back slightly later, and the recent price was 5.07 yuan.</p>
<p>American-French: The opening price of the New York exchange rate for the French franc against the US dollar was 6.6075, down 1 pound sterling from yesterday.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>American Cotton: The cotton market opened with a slight change due to the closing of long positions by foreign traders. Although the sentiment is trending towards the long side, demand is relatively quiet, and merchants want to wait for the weather report before deciding how to proceed. Indian Cotton: The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by retail investors and Japanese merchants, and then fell due to the closing of long positions and profit-taking. The closing price of White Locke cotton for July-August was 209.75 rupees, down 3 rupees from yesterday. British Cotton: The price for the July contract in the Liverpool cotton market at 1:00 PM today was 6.26, down 2 pounds sterling. British Wheat: The price for the July contract in the Liverpool wheat market was 4 shillings and 8.25 pence, down 0.125.</p>
<h3>Rubber</h3>
<p>London Rubber Market: The market was quiet this afternoon. The transaction price for July-September contracts was 6.375 pence, down 0.0625 from yesterday's closing price. New York Rubber Market: The market was initially stable, then quiet, and there was a softening trend. The sentiment is still good, but merchants are now closely watching the development of other markets.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York securities opened sluggishly but still stable. The labor situation is still a cause for unease, and there is also a lack of momentum from buying, but the recent upsurge seems to have a slight hope of unfolding. The trading volume in the first hour after today's opening was 120,000 shares.

<h3>福州 Drought Demon Causes Disaster: Fields and Soils Crack, Streams and Gullies Dry Up, Farmers Run Out of Food, Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The northwestern regions of Fujian Province experienced a drought between last autumn and summer, resulting in the complete failure of the late rice crop and widespread famine. Farmers resorted to eating wild grass and duckweed to stave off hunger, and many starved to death. Although the government transported seafood to provide relief, it was to no avail. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of spring this year, and up to April, there have been fewer than ten days of rainfall, and the drought has returned. The early rice crop planted by farmers in the higher-lying fields has withered and died due to lack of irrigation for two months. The lower-lying fields were still able to draw water from streams and gullies for cultivation, but disputes over water often arose between villages, and the district office was busy mediating. Farmers, fearing that their water would be stolen, took turns guarding their fields day and night, enduring great hardship. However, a month ago, the streams and gullies also dried up, and the crops in the lower-lying fields withered and died completely, resulting in a complete failure of the early rice crop. Recently, the scorching sun has been in the sky, with no trace of clouds. The soil has cracked due to the sun, and horses can gallop through the fields. Even the crops and vegetable leaves that are byproducts of farming are withered and useless. The livelihoods of farmers have been completely cut off. Rice prices have soared, rising from eight yuan per unit to over nine yuan in just ten days. Several farmers in the northwestern villages have committed suicide due to lack of food. It is expected that the famine will be even more severe in the next two to three months than it was last year. The village offices held a meeting last week to discuss relief measures, believing that the frequent droughts were due in part to the lack of rainfall and in part to the blockage of waterways, which prevented water from flowing. It was decided to establish a dredging committee for the northwestern villages to dredge all the blocked waterways, allowing the flow of the Min River to reach the interior. The project will be assigned to landowners on both sides of the waterways, but the project is vast and cannot be completed in less than six months, which is too slow to provide immediate relief. Some village elders announced to the villagers, starting on May 30th, that everyone should be vegetarian for three days. On June 1st, hundreds of people gathered outside the North Gate of Zhanban Village, dressed in white, wearing straw sandals, and carrying withered rice stalks and dry soil, along with a Taoist priest. They loudly beat drums and chanted loudly along the way to the Xiyuan Temple at the Fourteen Gate Bridge outside the West Gate, to invite the Three Sage Rulers to set up an altar at Lianhua Peak outside the North Gate to pray for rain. Unexpectedly, after burning incense and throwing divination blocks more than a hundred times, they were not granted permission to leave the temple to pray for rain. The hundreds of foolish farmers looked at each other in dismay and had to return dejectedly. Superstitious people therefore spread rumors that even the Three Sage Rulers could not pray for rain, and that there would be a severe drought this year with no salvation. People's hearts became increasingly uneasy. Amidst this famine panic, not only did the government have no relief measures, but the finance department, in urgent need of funds as the abandoned lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, ordered the tax collectors of the villages in Minhou County to collect three million yuan of grain loans for use within two weeks. The tax deed bureau also sent police to the villages to force people to pay taxes on their deeds, and those who had already paid were required to submit their deeds for inspection, causing great disturbance. The farmers cried out in pain. (2nd)</p>
<h3>You Guocai Denies Rumors: Sends Representative to Guangdong to Express Attitude, Cables Wang Jialie Affirming Maintenance of Peace</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: There have been many rumors in Guizhou Province recently. There is no question that Wang Jialie supports the Southwest. As for You Guocai, who has always been anti-Wang, it has been rumored that he is colluding with Yunnan to contain Wang. However, You recently refuted this rumor, and specially sent his chief of staff, Cai Zizheng, as a representative to Guangdong to express everything and to conduct liaison. Cai arrived in Guangzhou on the 1st and immediately visited Chen Jitang to report in detail on the current situation in Guizhou Province and You's peaceful attitude. That afternoon, he also visited Li Zongren to discuss the recent situation in Guizhou and Guangxi. On the 2nd, he went to Hong Kong to visit Hu Hanmin and made some representations. As for the rumors that You was colluding with Yunnan to covet Guizhou, You had already cabled Wang Jialie to explain the truth. "Your telegram has been received. It is my secret hope that the realization of peace here is not just empty talk. Therefore, I have been hoping for the arrival of Yin Xian for some time, but he has not been seen, which has led outsiders to speculate and spread rumors. In reality, the various departments on the west road are at peace. The rotation of defenses between Pu'an and Anlong has been misinterpreted by outsiders, and they have added to the suspicion. I informed Chief He of the situation in advance. As for the so-called troops stationed on the riverside and the Yunnan army stationed in Pan County, the Liu Brigade is still in Pan County, and Wan's own troops are still in Kunming. The main force is also in Qujing, Pingyi and other counties, and has not moved from its original defense. These are the facts and cannot be concealed. I urge you not to be misled and to order Yin Xian to set out as soon as possible according to the original plan, so as to quell the rumors. If you delay any further, there will be more troubles. I respectfully reply. You Guocai." It is also heard that You's representative, Cai Zizheng, will return to Guizhou to report after visiting Hu in Hong Kong in about a week. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Guangxi Finance Director Arrives in Guangdong: Negotiates Economic Assistance, Promotes Sale of Guangdong Salt and Sugar, Discusses Transit Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to environmental factors, the southwestern provinces need to unite to resist foreign insults. Therefore, envoys from various provinces have been traveling back and forth very frequently recently. Huang Zhongyue, the Finance Director of Guangxi Province, came to Guangdong in person on the 31st of last month to discuss various issues with the local authorities, in order to promote economic cooperation between the two provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong. According to Huang, Guangxi Province's finances have always been based on balancing income and expenditure. The annual income of national taxes in Guangxi Province is more than 13 million yuan, and the provincial taxes are more than 17 million yuan. Although the financial situation is difficult, it is still able to meet the expenses of military and political affairs. Guangxi Bank recently experienced a disturbance, and the value of banknotes fell to 7%, that is, 7 yuan per 100 yuan. It has now returned to its original state. The purpose of this trip to Guangdong is to investigate Guangdong Province's finances and to negotiate assistance in promoting the sale of Guangdong's salt and sugar products. Recently, Guangdong's salt and sugar production has been excessive, and it is planned to sell them to Yunnan and Guizhou. However, if Guangdong's salt and sugar are transported to Guizhou and Yunnan, they must pass through Guangxi Province. In the future, the tax rates for goods in transit and the measures for Guangxi Province to protect Guangdong goods in transit must be discussed in detail with the Guangdong authorities. In addition, the Xijiang River is an important transportation route between Guangdong and Guangxi, and there have been many long-standing problems with factory taxes. It is planned to take this opportunity to discuss cleaning up the problems with the Guangdong authorities. Qu Fangpu, the Finance Director of Guangdong, has been discussing with Huang in detail for several days, and various matters have been resolved one by one. Huang is scheduled to return to Guangxi on the 3rd. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Border Tusi Representatives Visit Deng Xihou: Deng Xihou Stages Military Demonstration, Representatives Prostrate and Kowtow</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Jun Zhaxi, the Tusi of Moxi in the grassland area on the border of Sichuan and Gansu, Jia Ge, the representative of Alu, the local official of Shangliuzhai, along with his entourage Suolang, Zewang, Langge, and Langba, the representative of Renqin, the Grand Tusi of the Forty-Eight Villages of Maoniugou in Songpan, have successively arrived in the province to visit Deng Xihou, the commander of the 28th Army. Deng summoned them at the army headquarters on Huaxing Street at 10:00 AM on May 26th. At that time, from the main gate of the army headquarters straight to the army commander's reception hall, the posts were densely guarded and the security was strict. The officials of the various departments were all in full uniform. Under the pomegranate tree on the left side of the reception hall was a military band. Banners and red flags were hung in front of the hall, and colorful tents were set up. A large public table was set in the center, with a very large tin pen holder, inkstone, stationery tube, and seal box on it. Deng sat in the middle in military uniform with a commander's saber hanging on his side. Deng Chongde, the director of the colonization office, stood on the right. Wen Tao, the director of the adjutant's office, Liu Xiong, the adjutant-general, and the staff members stood on the left and right. Below the steps, teams of machine gunners and infantry guarded the area in layers. Then, Jia Ge and Suolang were led in by the adjutant's office. (Zewang and Langge had returned due to illness.) Jia Ge, with a plaster on the left side of his face, dressed in Yi ethnic clothing, and Suolang walked forward with their heads bowed and prostrated themselves in front of the steps. Qi Yunbang (from Songpan), the consultant of the army headquarters, translated. Jia Ge knelt on his right knee and stated in the Yi language that Huang Zhengqing and his son of the Labrang Monastery had invaded Aba. Huang had now applied to the Gansu Provincial Government to report to Commander-in-Chief Jiang, preparing to send a large army to Aba to attack in March of this year, and also stated that the murderer who killed the local official of Shangliuzhai was a lama named Saikang, who had also fled to the Labrang Monastery. He requested the army commander to take charge, recover Aba, and not be governed by another province, and complained that he had been in the province for a long time, and the lodging was a heavy burden, and asked the army commander to give him travel expenses and send a car to Guanxian, and to issue a passport. Deng comforted them and said: (1) The border dispute between Sichuan and Gansu and the disturbance caused by Huang Zhengqing and his son have been reported to the central government by this army commander, and will be resolved after hearing from them. (2) The title given to Yang Jun Zhaxi by the former Han army commander is no longer applicable. This army commander has now appointed Yang Jun Zhaxi as the first route guerrilla commander of the Sichuan Songli Maomao Wun Colonization Supervisory Office to deter the Black Moxi area. (3) Permission is granted to purchase 15 rifles and 5,000 rounds of ammunition. (4) Immediately telegraph the Gansu Provincial Government and ask them to order the surrender of Lama Saikang for punishment according to law. (5) Tell Yang Jun Zhaxi not to make trouble. If troops from other provinces invade, he can immediately report it, and I will decide to protect him. (6) The area under the jurisdiction of the guerrilla commander should be limited to the Moxi Tusi area without orders from the army headquarters or the colonization office. At this point, Jia Ge also Chen Eluo Fanba Lao Mincheng Jia, the local official Shen Xi Tuo, requested the army commander to issue a notice prohibiting Ma Qi's officers and soldiers from invading the Sichuan border in the Eluo Hajun area. Chairman Xi Anma has telegraphed that the Gansu and Qinghai troops will never invade the Sichuan border, and hopes that people will live in peace, graze, and trade without being disturbed. Every time Deng spoke, Jia Ge and others would kowtow to show their obedience. Then Deng presented Yang Jun Zhaxi with an official seal and a triangular yellow silk flag with the words "Yang, the First Route Guerrilla Commander of the Sichuan Songli Maomao Wun Colonization Supervisory Office." The official seal and the wooden box were placed in front of Jia Ge and others, who prostrated themselves on the blanket. Jia Ge and others stood up, knelt down, and received them. Deng then took out a knife from his side and said, "I also wear a knife. My knife is to protect good people and kill bad people. Now I will also give Yang Zhaxi a knife, and tell him to protect good people and kill bad people." After Deng finished speaking, he gave awards (1) Award Yang Jun Zhaxi two pieces each of high-quality satin domestic cloth robes, a leather briefcase, a pair of leather boots, a pair of leather leggings, a felt hat, and a knife belt. (2) Award Eluo Fanba one piece each of high-quality satin domestic cloth robes and a pair of leather shoes and a felt hat. (3) Award Representative Jia Ge one piece of second-class satin robe material, a doctoral hat, and forty silver dollars. (4) Award Suolang Zewang Langge one piece of blue Haki cloth each, and ten silver dollars. Jia and others bowed and thanked them one by one, and said that they had heard the army commander's instructions clearly. "We are very ashamed that we did not offer the army commander anything of value, but we received the army commander's generous gifts. However, Commander Yang said that the army commander is our master, and it is right for a son to receive something from his mother and father. When the army commander's official documents arrive in Moxi, there will always be one or two thousand cavalrymen to greet them. Receiving the official documents is like receiving the army commander. The barbarians were originally the same kind of people, only the language is different. This is not only dead, but also on the way. Now, on behalf of Commander Yang, I thank you for your commission (kowtow) and feel like seeing the Lord of Life, like seeing the Bodhisattva." Then they said goodbye, and the music played.</p>
<p>After Jia Ge and others retreated, Langba, the representative of Renqin of Maoniugou, was summoned to meet. Lang was wearing a blue student uniform, with a fountain pen and a diary hanging on his left chest, yellow pants, and leather shoes, a young Werther among the Yi people. He went up the steps, prostrated himself, and knelt down, and Qi Yunbang translated. But Deng thought that Lang could speak Chinese, so he ordered him to state directly. Lang said that he had met Commander-in-Chief last spring, and the Bihe War followed. Traffic was blocked, and he did not return to Maoniugou to report to the Tusi Renqin until October. The forty-eight village Tusi were in awe of the army commander's kindness and power, and sent me to meet the army commander again. Then he presented a fine horse to thank you for the items bestowed last year. Lang also reported on the harassment and looting by Cha Nuo Ma, and planned to ask to purchase weapons for defense, and hoped to add a commission. Deng Yu said that the affairs of Sichuan have gradually improved, and the borderlands will naturally be better. I always hope that you will improve your lives, and I hope that the people of the borderlands will come to the interior to observe. After arriving in Maozhou, I will send someone to protect you out, and I will also send someone to protect you back. It is not right for Cha Nuo Ma to rob you and you to retaliate. Your Tusi in that valley are not good, and I have someone investigating. You go back and tell the Tusi to be good. I will help whoever is good. Colonizing the borderlands is to liberate you. To live in the borderlands, you must be in the interior. Now I will approve your request to purchase 12 guns. I have a whole plan for the commission, and I will give the commission after they come to see me. Then he gave awards (1) Award the Tusi Renqin one piece each of high-quality satin domestic cloth robes, a pair of leather shoes, and a felt hat. (2) Award Langba one piece of second-class satin robe material and ten silver dollars. Langba bowed his head and thanked him and retreated.</p>

<h3>Wuxi: County Funds are Unified for Collection and Expenditure by the Treasury</h3>
<p>The county government has received instructions from the Provincial Finance Department. Starting from the 23rd year, all county local tax revenues, except for the Qingzhang Fee, which is directly submitted to the provincial treasury by the county, must be deposited into the county treasury. County Magistrate Yan, upon receiving the order, specially convened the directors of the Public Security, Construction, and Education Bureaus, as well as the director of the County and City Funds Management Office, and the presidents of the Jiangsu and Farmers Banks, to discuss the matter at a meeting yesterday. The results decided to be reported to the Department for explanation and to propose the following modifications: (1) There is no doubt about the Payment Act, but according to the provincial government's order to guarantee the independence of education funding, the education item in the general reserve fee will still have a clear distinction. Also, although there are regulations in the construction project budget, the project must be designed according to actual needs and submitted for approval when the project is implemented, which is equivalent to temporary expenditure. In the future, whether the temporary expenditure of the Education and Construction Departments should follow the case of the competent department without approval, it is proposed to explain it, so that there is something to follow. (2) County funds are collected and disbursed by the treasury. There are deposits in prosperous months, and no interest is calculated. If there is a shortage in lean months, the treasury should advance funds within the total budget limit, and no interest should be calculated. (3) The purpose of the education fee accumulation fund, the kinship pension fund, and the famine prevention grain storage fund in this county has always been to deposit funds to generate interest. The income of the accumulation fund has already been included in the budget. If it is handed over to the treasury and no interest is given, it will affect the budget, and other obstacles will also occur. It is proposed to exempt it from being handed over to the treasury. (4) In accordance with the provincial treasury and Qingzhang special fund methods, a working capital of 10,000 yuan should be reserved to meet the temporary needs of various agencies and emergencies. It can be discussed and a payment order can be issued first, and then reported for approval. (5) Education funds are paid monthly, and the police team is paid in three ten-day periods. In the future, payments will be made in two installments.</p>

However, Yongtai Chang in Shitang Town, Gonghe in Bashiqiao, and Huimin and other cocoon merchants in the southern townships have stopped weighing yesterday due to the weak arrival of goods. The remaining merchants are still collecting cocoons. Merchants with a lot of goods receive 200 dans of cocoons every day, and the least receive 30 dans. In addition, the cocoon posts received by the various cocoon merchants were sent by the merchants to the Cocoon Industry Association, totaling 384 papers.

<h3>Implementation of Merging Autonomous Regions</h3>
<p>The autonomous regions of this county are divided into 17 cities and townships, and the names have been changed to district offices. In fact, they are no different from the previous city and township administrative bureaus. Therefore, for several years, due to limited funds, there have been no achievements. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of this, decided to merge the autonomous regions of various counties, with a maximum of no more than 12 districts. Area, population, and economy are the criteria for dividing the districts. The county government of this county has convened several meetings with the heads of various districts and relevant parties and decided to merge them into ten districts. The candidates for district heads have also been submitted to the province for approval by the county government and will be announced in a few days.</p>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Cables Executive Yuan Urging Swift Abolition of Exorbitant Taxes; Should Provinces Delay, Order Strict Enforcement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Executive Yuan, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing Executive Yuan, the resolutions of the National Financial Conference regarding the permanent prohibition of additional surcharges on land taxes and the swift abolition of exorbitant taxes have been met with widespread joy, hailed as a panacea for the revival of the national economy. However, there are concerns that provincial accounting officials may use the excuse of a lack of compensatory measures to delay implementation, making it difficult for actual benefits to reach the people. It is requested that the Yuan clarify that this conference has already decided to allocate the stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol license tax, which belong to the central government, to the provinces, and to transfer judicial expenses to the national budget. This will alleviate the financial burden on the provinces and provide compensatory measures. The central government's consideration for the local governments is already comprehensive and considerate, and it is not imposing impossible demands. The two resolutions must be strictly enforced in order to uphold the authority of the nation and fulfill the hopes of the people. Your prompt attention is greatly anticipated." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully presents this.</p>
<h3>Wang Jialie Telegraphs Report on Blockading and Suppressing Bandit He's Remnants Escaping into Guizhou; Requests Sichuan Army Cross Border for Joint Suppression</h3>
<p>A certain gentleman, a native of Guizhou province residing in Shanghai, received an urgent telegram yesterday from Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government and Commander of the Twenty-Fifth Army. The text is recorded below (abbreviated titles): "The situation in Guizhou has fortunately achieved peace. After the communist bandit He Long was defeated in Sichuan, the remnants of his forces, numbering about 5,000, have infiltrated Guizhou. I have strictly ordered the troops in the counties bordering Guizhou to vigorously block and defend, and have decided to dispatch three regiments of elite troops, under the command of Brigade Commander Li Chengzhang, to Zunyi immediately to assist in the suppression. I have also telegraphed the Sichuan army requesting the pursuit troops to cross the border for joint suppression, in order to eliminate the bandit and prevent it from spreading. This matter concerns the safety of the entire Guizhou province and is a major problem for the border areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces. I can only encourage my subordinates to disregard everything and vow to completely eliminate the bandit as soon as possible to fulfill my responsibilities. More information will follow." Wang Jialie (seal).</p>
<h3>Li Liejun Talks About Impressions of Tour in Shandong; Shandong Officials Frugal and Hardworking; Li Plans to Go to Lushan for Rest</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Liejun, member of the Central Committee, went to Qingdao from Shanghai last month to recuperate. He met Feng Yuxiang in Weixian and then toured various counties in Jiaodong and famous scenic spots together. After sending Feng back to Mount Tai, Li returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 6th). Reporters from various newspapers visited Li at his private residence on Avenue Massenet yesterday to discuss his impressions of his tour in Shandong. Li said that his blood pressure had risen again recently and that he would go to Lushan for rest. The details of what he said are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Abundant Products in Counties of Jiaodong</h3>
<p>This trip to Qingdao was originally for recuperation. Since Mr. Feng came to Weixian, I toured various counties in Jiaodong and famous scenic spots with him. Because the country is in danger, I wanted to study the malpractices of China with Mr. Huanzhang and work with righteous gentlemen in the country to save it. Everywhere we went, the people were simple and honest, and the products were abundant. Most people were engaged in agriculture and commerce, so there were few vagrants. Jiaodong is therefore in a state of wealth. Most counties have county-run middle schools, and elementary schools are everywhere. Transportation, education, and industry are relatively developed. Although most customs have not been reformed, it is also a country with potential. From the chairman of the provincial government to the county magistrates, they are frugal and hardworking, which is the best among all the provinces. Unfortunately, in the trials of bandits, there is suspicion of misuse of power and interference in the judiciary. The number of people executed in various counties is alarming, so the people also say that the government of Shandong is as fierce as a tiger. If this can be improved, it will be a good government.</p>
<h3>Mr. Feng Huanzhang's Demeanor As Before</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng's demeanor, spirit, and perseverance are as before, but his knowledge has surpassed that of the past. He is extremely worried about the current state of the country. He believes that Japan is the most harmful foreign power to China, so he advocates actively resisting Japan and saving the country. Everywhere he went, he was warmly welcomed by the people. His speeches were also very effective in arousing public attention. Since Qingdao was taken over, the situation has been extremely complicated, and foreigners' strength is superior to that of the Chinese, as everyone knows. Fortunately, since Mayor Shen Honglie took office, he has been frugal and fair, and has earnestly reorganized the city. He has handled relations with foreigners appropriately, so there is no rampant situation. He has also vigorously supported autonomy and penetrated into the people. Therefore, Qingdao is tidy and clean on the surface, and transportation, education, and industry are developing in practice. The district offices established by the municipal government and the credit and consumer cooperatives have all achieved great results, and a group of service personnel are very energetic.</p>
<h3>High Blood Pressure Requiring Rest in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Jiaoji Railway has a debt of 40 million, with 7 million in cash and a lot of old materials. I heard that it has been proposed to build a branch line from Zhangdian via Boshan to Dakou. If this road is opened, the revenue will be doubled. Li said at the end, "My blood pressure has risen again, and I will go to Lushan for rest. I cannot talk too much. Our country is in a very dangerous period, and people across the country should rise up to save it."</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Huang Shaogu Goes to Europe to Study Today; Zhu Puzhi on the Same Ship to Europe to Investigate Agriculture</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Huang Shaogu and his wife, Ms. Hou Sufang, are going to Europe to study international politics and economics. At 11 o'clock last night, they boarded a small ferry from the Xinguankou Wharf to Pudong Qichang Wharf and boarded the Italian ship Conte Rosso, which set sail at 7 o'clock this morning. Many of Huang's relatives and friends went to the pier to see them off. Mr. and Mrs. Huang are traveling in second class. Before leaving, they said that Huang Shaogu plans to live in London, the capital of England, for a long time to study economics and international politics, for a period of three years. All expenses will be raised by himself, and personal life will be as frugal as possible. Central Committee Member Liu Yazi, Director of the International Trade Bureau He Bingxian, and others have been hosting farewell banquets for him for days. Wang Faqin and Li Xiehe went to Huang's residence on Route Lafayette one after another at 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon to see him off. Huang then returned to visit to say goodbye. Huang's children are all staying in Shanghai, under the care of his younger brother Di Fei. Mr. Zhu Puzhi, a specialist from the Rural Reconstruction Commission, is traveling on the same ship as Huang to Europe to investigate agriculture.</p>
<h3>American Aviator Russell Arrives in Shanghai; Says Future of Aviation in China is Promising</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Russell, an engineer of the Sperry Gyroscope Company of the United States, is skilled in aircraft piloting. He recently came to China at the invitation of Mr. Bolley of the Continental Aviation Company and the representative of the Sperry Company in China. He arrived in Shanghai a week ago. Mr. Russell is quite surprised by the development of commercial and military aviation in China, and says that China has a vast territory, and the future of this development is limitless. No country in the world can match it. In the future, when the government is stable, private flying will also be popular. Russell also commented on aviation routes, saying that many people say that air travel in China is too expensive, but in the future, after the promotion of commercial aviation, fares will inevitably decrease. The situation in the United States in the past was the same as in China. Later, new equipment was installed, and maintenance costs were greatly reduced, and air travel fares fell. Today, more and more people are flying, and although the fares are low, the profits are still high. China will also be like this in the future. Russell also mentioned the development of "blind flying", saying that after spending millions of US dollars researching for several years, the method of robot-piloted aircraft finally succeeded four years ago. This move has been trialed since 1913 and has now become a reality. For example, if you want to fly from Shanghai to Beiping now, you only need to install the aircraft properly and then let it depart, and five hours later, the aircraft will be in the sky over Beiping. Russell also described in detail the operation of this complex machine, which is enough to amaze those who hear it. Russell is a world traveler, and he has flown over almost every aviation route in the world. He is scheduled to go to Hangzhou before Sunday, stay for a few weeks, and then plans to go to South China, and will go to Manila, Bangkok, Saigon, Turkey, Persia, Damascus, the Netherlands, Germany, France, England, and other countries. Many aviation routes in the world rely on his planning to make them safer and more efficient.</p>

To save expenses, the company's address will not be relocated, as the existing rooms are sufficient for office use. The number of staff is also small. As for the business plan, it is inconvenient to disclose it.</p>

<p>After the presidium led the Panchen Lama and representatives of various government and military agencies and groups to visit the entire exhibition hall of national goods, the ceremony was completed after taking a photo at 3:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>At the National Goods Exhibition Hall's welcome to the Panchen Lama, Chairman Zhang Yichen said in his speech: "Today, we are honored to have the Panchen Lama visit and give a speech. All the members of our association are extremely happy and honored. The purpose of the National Exhibition Hall is to address the fact that in modern society, people admire Western culture and compete for luxury, leading to imported goods flooding the country and national goods being almost driven out. This is a great hidden worry for the future. Therefore, we have joined with colleagues to organize this association, on the one hand to resist the super-addition of imported goods, and on the other hand to regulate China's economy. Since the successive openings, we have been deeply grateful for the approval and joint maintenance of all sectors of society, and our reputation has increased day by day. If we can gradually promote and popularize it throughout the country, we may not be able to reverse the decline and increase the country's strength by one in ten thousand. The Lama is the Buddha of the West, a great man of our generation, who is concerned about national affairs and prays for peace, which is felt by the Chinese people. Wherever he goes, north and south, famous scholars and talented people rush to welcome him. On the day of his return, he will surely use the knowledge gained from his travels to govern the border people. Even if the powerful neighbors are concerned, it is difficult to achieve their ambitions of economic aggression. Today's welcome ceremony is like opening up another vital force for the future of production and sales cooperation of our national goods. I am writing this short speech to express my gratitude, and wish the party and the country ten thousand years, and the Lama ten thousand years."</p>
<h3>Panchen Lama's Reply</h3>
<p>After the chairman's speech, the Panchen Lama was invited to give a speech, which was translated by Secretary Liu Jiaji: "Today, I am very pleased to be invited to visit by the National Manufacturers Association. Your association promotes national goods in the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. I am very grateful for the Panchen Lama's participation. After I return to Tibet, I will do my best to cooperate with you. Tibetan religion has a close relationship with politics and economy. In the future, I hope to work hard together to live and work in peace. China and the world are increasingly peaceful. Sun Yat-sen treats all races equally. I, the Panchen Lama, also uphold this purpose and wish the country prosperity day by day."</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong's Speech</h3>
<p>Then Wang Yansong gave a speech, saying: "The Panchen Lama has traveled from Ping to Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai this time. Wherever he goes, all groups and agencies welcome him sincerely. The meaning of the welcome from all walks of life and the relationship with Tibet have been published in newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. Now, the Lama hopes that all sectors of China will become more peaceful and prosperous, but this is the common hope of the whole country. Our country is being forced by strong neighbors. Since the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the international background has become an open secret. Therefore, simply put, if we want to seek self-reliance, we must promote national goods. Because in recent years, the purchase of foreign goods and the outflow of money has been countless. They use our money to manufacture as much murderous weapon as possible in preparation for world war. The only remedy is not to buy foreign goods and not to overflow our rights and benefits. Everyone buys national goods.</p>
<p>Money will have nowhere to flow out. Now, when the master returns to Tibet, please do your best to promote and propagandize it. In the future, Tibet will be a huge source of goods for our country. If we do it with an indomitable spirit, we can achieve a rich country and a strong people, and live and work in peace." Then, Chen Jingsheng, the representative of the International Trade Bureau, gave a speech, and Liu Zhongying delivered a thank-you speech. The length of the speeches will not be recorded.</p>
<h3>Week-Long Visit</h3>
<p>After the meeting, the presidium led the Lama and representatives of various agencies and groups to visit the temporary market. The goods displayed by various manufacturers started from the auditorium, went through Yongning Road and Penglai Road to the Penglai City Market, and rested at the Penglai Bank. The Lama praised the displayed national goods very much and encouraged them. Yesterday, the manufacturers of the Penglai City Market also used yellow silk cloth to decorate and hung horizontal plaques with the words "Welcome the Panchen Lama" at each entrance to show their welcome.</p>
<h3>Tight Security</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched dozens of patrolmen and assigned them to guard the entrances and main roads in shifts. There</p>
<p>were security teams in charge of investigation, and anyone with suspicious behavior was prohibited from entering. Therefore, the security in the venue was very strict.</p>
<p>Panchen Lama Visits Italian Ship Conte Rosso (Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<h3>Visit to Italian Ship</h3>
<p>The Italian postal ship Conte Rosso welcomed the Panchen Lama to visit. The ship was newly decorated. Yesterday afternoon, the municipal government specially prepared a small steamer and waited at the Xinguankou Wharf. At 5:20 p.m., the Panchen Lama, accompanied by his entourage and representatives from the municipal government, arrived at the Xinguankou Wharf and took a small steamer to the Qichang Pier in Pudong to board the ship. The Italian company specially sent Cai Hanzhang and Shao Jingqing to accompany the Lama on board and guide him on the tour. The ship owners and others wholeheartedly welcomed him in all classes and all parts of the ship. Whenever there were inquiries, Cai and Shao would provide explanations. Tea and snacks were specially prepared on the ship. After the visit was completed, they took the same steamer back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Submits Petition to Survey and Repair Wusong Seawall to Protect Millions of Lives in the Town</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the municipal government, stating: "The purpose of this petition is as follows: On the 6th of this month, we received a letter from the Wusong branch of our association, stating that during the typhoon last year, the seawall of Wusong was washed away in more than a dozen places along the coast and along the harbor. The mud dike on the north side collapsed for tens of feet, and the situation is even more dangerous. Our office has reported to your association and urgently requested the authorities to come and repair it. We were informed that we have telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allocate funds for it. However, after a year, the breach in the Wusong seawall remains and the provincial government has not sent workers to repair it. Now that the summer flood season is about to pass and the autumn tides are following, it is inevitable that the broken seawall will be overwhelmed by the endless wind and waves, and the breach will expand and flood the people of Wusong. Our office is taking precautions and taking care of the lives of the people of Wusong, and we cannot sit idly by. Therefore, we ask your association to transfer the matter to the municipal authorities and ask the Public Works Bureau to quickly repair the collapsed sections of the outer road of Wusong and the mud dike on the north side as soon as possible, so that the people of Wusong will be fortunate. After investigation, Wusong Town is under the jurisdiction of our city, and the seawall project is related to the lives of the people of Wusong. The year-long repair project is equivalent to building a house on the road. The summer flood season is approaching, and looking ahead, we are terrified. We hereby submit this petition to your office for verification and approval, and request that the Public Works Bureau be instructed to allocate funds quickly to repair the collapsed sections of the outer road of the town and the mud dike on the north side as soon as possible, so as to protect the lives of millions of people in the town. This is for the public convenience."</p>

<h3>Wang Delin Sends Chief of Staff Jia Mingzhou to Shanghai with a Letter; Requests the Relief Association to Continue Assistance so that Soldiers Have No Worries</h3>
<p>Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, said that after his troops withdrew to Russia, some of the officers' and soldiers' families came to Shanghai last summer, and the various charitable organizations of the United Relief Association of Northeast Refugees provided them with accommodation, education, and care, for which they were deeply grateful. Recently, he specially sent Jia Mingzhou, the chief of staff of the unit, to Shanghai with a letter to the Relief Association, requesting continued assistance. The original letter reads: "To the benevolent members of the United Relief Association of Northeast Refugees, since the Japanese pirates have invaded and the Northeast has fallen, Delin is saddened and filled with righteous indignation. Therefore, he raised an army in eastern Jilin and called for volunteers. The men gathered and fought bravely. After a year of bitter fighting, we hoped to wipe out the barbarians and restore our homeland. However, we ran out of ammunition and had no reinforcements, and were forced to retreat to Russia last spring. Some of the officers' and soldiers' families were displaced overseas. Fortunately, your association provided assistance, setting up a museum and providing meals, education, and care. We are grateful for your kindness. Now that the time has come to eliminate the enemy, the soldiers in the front are fighting bravely. We hope that your association will continue to provide assistance so that the soldiers will have no worries and will be more motivated to kill the enemy. In the future, when the homeland is restored, you will share the glory. Therefore, we have specially sent Jia Mingzhou, the chief of staff of our unit, to thank you and submit this letter to express our gratitude. We respectfully ask for your peace." Signed, Wang Delin.</p>
<h3>The Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Labor Strike Stalled: The Strike Committee Petitions for Relief</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The labor strike at the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory in Pudong has been deadlocked and remains unresolved. The Strike Committee yesterday submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting that it be forwarded to the Central Government for swift relief. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Regarding the ongoing petition concerning the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's disregard for the law and illegal factory closure, with no resolution in sight, we earnestly request swift relief. The Anglo-American Tobacco Company in Pudong, Shanghai, has inexplicably closed its factory, inciting a strike. The details of what has transpired have been presented in two previous submissions. However, the unrest has persisted for nearly a month. The factory has hired White Russian ruffians as replacements. Despite repeated mediation by your esteemed organization, the factory has refused to cooperate, resulting in the indefinite postponement of a resolution. Eight thousand workers face starvation and unspeakable suffering. If this continues, we will all perish together.</p>
<p>"We, the workers of this association, remember our past contributions to the Party and the nation in the fight for tariffs. Now, we are suffering under the illegal oppression of the capitalists. Your esteemed organization, with its concern for the people's welfare, cannot bear to stand idly by. We request that you forward this petition to the National Government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Guidance Committee for the People's Movement, seeking swift relief, like sweet dew on parched land, so that we may celebrate our resurgence. Even the most devoted service would not be enough to repay such kindness. The situation is urgent, and we await your consideration and action."</p>
<h3>Declaration by the Newspaper Trade Union: In Support of the Striking Workers of the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>Fellow countrymen across the nation! The more someone wears the mask of civilization, the more barbarous and unreasonable their actions become. This is especially true of British imperialists. We cannot help but recall the May 30th Massacre of 1925, where they slaughtered countless innocent compatriots in their eagerness to curry favor with Japanese capitalists. At that time, we passively resisted by implementing a "boycott of enemy goods," but that brief burst of enthusiasm has long since faded away. Yet their methods of aggression have made remarkable progress since then.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how tyrannical the capitalists of the Anglo-American Tobacco Company are. They use extraterritoriality as a shield, setting aside the orders of Chinese officials, and dismissing the three thousand-odd workers who produce for them with the flimsy excuse of "poor business and worker insubordination." On May 12th, they abruptly announced the factory's closure, condemning workers who have contributed to the company's success to death. Everyone knows that the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's profits are staggeringly high. As such, they should treat the workers who produce for them with sweat and blood with generosity. However, the reality is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not dream that these "robbers will have a change of heart," but we hope they will maintain the status quo, so that a group of toiling workers can continue to make a living. As for the claim of worker insubordination, that is even more of a joke. If it were indeed true, the company could file a complaint with the Chinese authorities, who have methods for dealing with such situations. However, the company authorities have not considered this. Instead, they suddenly resort to high-handed tactics against our group of intellectually unsophisticated, desperate laborers. They recklessly undermine the amity between the two nations and hire a large number of armed detectives to beat and injure over a dozen defenseless fellow workers.</p>
<p>Let us now be blunt: the Anglo-American Tobacco Company's capitalists are not motivated by poor business or worker insubordination. Rather, the Anglo-American Tobacco Company authorities are deliberately sabotaging the labor movement in our country and resent the high wages of the original workers. They seek to replace them with another group of workers, subject to their exploitation, to satiate their selfish desires for economic aggression.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that our government authorities will not treat this strike as just another ordinary labor dispute. If the Anglo-American Tobacco Company is allowed to oppress in this manner, we believe that many similar labor disputes will soon follow. The Newspaper Trade Union, bearing the principles of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold" and "shared destiny," cannot bear to stand idly by while a group of toiling workers cry out in hunger and cold, suffering the devastation of imperialism, without taking action. We hope that countrymen across the nation will provide unified assistance to achieve ultimate victory. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3>French Female Prophet Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports: The prophecies of the world-renowned French female prophet, Madame Leila, have all come true.

She plans to stay in Shanghai for several days.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Completion of Six Breaches in Stone Embankment Undertaken by the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee; Provincial Government Dispatches Personnel for Inspection and Acceptance</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee at 97 Renji Road previously consulted with the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding the repair of breaches in the Gaoyou Canal dike at locations such as the Tangjunlou Miaoxiangkou and the Qigongdian, and the conversion of earthen dikes into stone structures. Recognizing this as an important measure for disaster prevention, it was decided at several meetings to undertake the project, and Huang Hanzhi was publicly appointed as the director, and Wang Shuxiang as the deputy director of the project. The planned charts and diagrams were submitted to the Provincial Government for record, and construction continued. The dike is four zhang high, six zhang wide, and 1,522 chi long. The project took ten months and was completely finished last month. The Provincial Government appointed Secretary Shen Bao and Technician Sun Fengwu of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to represent them in the inspection and acceptance on June 1st in Gaoyou. The measured dimensions of height, width, and length were all in excess, and the workmanship was up to standard. It was also said that in the 700 li of the canal south from Jiangkou and north to the Shandong border, there had never been such a project. This demonstrates that the work is solid, the materials are reliable, and the management is competent. If the receiving agency can properly maintain and protect it in the years to come, then the lives and property of millions of people in the ten counties of Jiangbei can be protected from the threat of flooding.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Returns Confiscated National Silk: Silk Trade Guild Receives Notification from the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The Silk Trade Guild and the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Trade Guild of this city had previously reported that domestic silk products shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong were seized by the Guangdong Zhongxing Company as foreign goods, requiring payment of a special tax. The two guilds, together with the Guangdong Silk and Cloth Trade Association, jointly appointed representatives to petition in Beijing, and requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to the Beijing and Guangdong authorities, requesting an order for their release. These matters have been reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that all confiscated goods have been returned. The notice from the Ministry of Industry, Shang Zi No. 26424, is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Notice to the Shanghai Silk Trade Guild, etc.: Approving the Guangdong Provincial Government's Cai Zi No. 2629 letter, which stated: 'Previously approved a telegram stating that according to the Shanghai Silk Trade Guild, etc., domestic silk products shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong were seized by the Zhongxing Company, requesting assistance, etc., forwarded for thorough investigation and orders for release, etc.' The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry were directed to handle the matter properly. Now, a report states that this case was previously reported by the Guangdong Province Yangbupitou Special Tax Zhongxing Company, which reported the seizure of Yutai Xiang and Bei Yulun's artificial silk crepe shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong, requesting verification, etc., to the office. Letters were sent ordering the goods held in the case to be sent to the office, and a date was set for the first day of this month to convene a public inspection to verify the postal packages. If the goods were imported, taxes would be paid according to regulations. If they were not imported, the goods would be returned. The committee was dispatched by the office to handle the matter jointly. Subsequently, the committee reported back that the goods were verified to be domestic goods and were immediately returned to shops such as Bei Yulun and Yutai Xiang for collection.' Based on the previous order, it is appropriate to report the handling of this case to the government for review and request separate responses for public convenience, etc. This should be forwarded and duly noted, etc. This notice is hereby given for your information."</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Women's Movement: Ms. Lin Kecong Practices Law</h3>
<p>Ms. Lin Kecong, a leader in the women's movement and a graduate, was awarded a lawyer's license by the Ministry of Justice in 1930. However, due to her years of involvement in the women's movement, she has been unable to practice until now. Now, in view of the fact that impoverished women are often oppressed and have no way to appeal, she has joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member and will begin her practice today. It is heard that Ms. Lin has leased No. 77, Hehefang, Lane 526, Xiafei Road, as her office, which is truly a cause for celebration for the helpless women of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Results of the Tiger Brand Yong An Tang Appeal: Ren An Tang's Monkey and Lion Trademarks Revoked</h3>
<p>Since Tiger Brand Yong An Tang's medicines were introduced to the country, their effectiveness and remarkable efficacy have led to increased sales and a growing reputation. As a result, some unscrupulous individuals have tried various methods to imitate the brand in order to profit. Shantou Ren An Tang is one of them, having used the lion and monkey trademarks to imitate Tiger Brand's Wan Jin You and Bagua Dan, etc. Yong An Tang filed a lawsuit according to law, resulting in a prison sentence and the approval of the Trademark Bureau to revoke its monkey and lion trademarks. After repeated litigation, the Executive Yuan finally decided to uphold the Trademark Bureau's decision to revoke Ren An Tang's monkey and lion trademarks. The decision is recorded below to inform those concerned about trademark disputes:</p>
<p>Executive Yuan Decision Letter No. 19, Twenty-Third Year, Su Zi: Re-Appellant Hu Wenhua's Agent Hu Guigeng of Tiger Brand Yong An Tang. The right re-appellant, in the case of the dispute with Ren An Tang over the monkey and lion trademarks, was dissatisfied with the decision of the Ministry of Industry and filed a re-appeal. The decision of this Yuan is as follows:</p>
<p>"Main Text" The original decision is revoked. The Trademark Bureau's decision to revoke Ren An Tang's monkey and monkey trademarks is upheld.</p>
<p>"Facts" The re-appellant claimed that Ren An Tang Pharmacy had added images and text to the approved Trademark Bureau registration No. 15967 monkey trademark and No. 17953 running lion trademark, imitating the re-appellant's registered Tiger, Bagua Dan, approved portrait and graphics of Hu Wenhua and Hu Wenbao, and filed a petition to the Trademark Bureau for revocation in July 1931. After ordering Ren An Tang to respond repeatedly, Ren An Tang stated in a submission to the office on March 21, 1932 (the original decision and re-appeal letter mistakenly stated March 17, 1932) that it was willing to cease using the added annotations on the monkey and lion trademarks from that day forward. The existing packaged goods, all with added images and text around the monkey trademark and running lion trade name, would be destroyed. The bureau approved this and notified the re-appellant. On September 23, 1932, the re-appellant submitted multiple illustrations as proof that Ren An Tang's disputed trademark annotations had not been destroyed and continued to be used, infringing on trademark exclusive rights, and requested the Trademark Bureau to revoke the trademarks. The bureau then, in accordance with Article 19 of the Trademark Law, revoked the registration of the monkey and lion trademarks with Order No. 5231. Ren An Tang, dissatisfied with this decision, appealed to the Ministry of Industry on the grounds that it had not continued to use the annotations. The ministry then decided to revoke the original decision of the Trademark Bureau. The re-appellant, unwilling to accept the decision, filed a re-appeal with this Yuan.</p>
<p>"Reasoning" To determine whether there is merit to this re-appeal, it must be determined whether Ren An Tang continued to use the monkey and lion trademark annotations after March 20, 1932. According to the emergency notice submitted by the re-appellant on September 20, 1933, from Zhangzhou Shunxing and other shops, it stated, "Our shop and others sell Lion Brand Panacea." The apology notice from Lin Zhenxun, the owner of Xiamen Zhaoyuan Pharmacy, stated, "Our pharmacy recently consigned Lion Brand Panacea from Guo Dongcai of Shantou Ren An Tang." Furthermore, the judgment document Yi Zi No. 361 of the Minhou Local Court on November 14, 1933, recognized in its fact section that Zhou Wudi purchased 87 dozen of Ren An Tang's imitations of Yong An Tang's Tiger Brand Wan Jin You on April 10 of the same year, convicting Zhou Wudi of the crime of "selling goods with counterfeit trademarks." Therefore, the re-appellant's claim that Ren An Tang continued to use the annotations of the aforementioned trademarks after March 21, 1932, is credible. The Trademark Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of Article 19, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Trademark Law, revoked the registration of Ren An Tang's monkey and lion trademarks, and there is nothing wrong with it. The Ministry of Industry's revocation of the original decision cannot be considered appropriate. Based on the above reasoning, this re-appeal is justified. Therefore, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 9 of the Administrative Appeal Law, it is decided as in the main text.</p>

<h3>City God Celebrates 60th Anniversary: The City God Temple Was Unusually Bustling Yesterday</h3>
<p>In recent years, superstitious activities in this city have emerged one after another. Yesterday, it was said to be the 60th anniversary of the City God's assumption of office, and the general ignorant men and women who went to the City God Temple to burn incense were as numerous as water flowing into a ravine. The temple was crowded with tens of thousands of people, so congested that it was impossible to move. The Nine-Bend Bridge and other places were also very congested. It is unknown who started this trend, which is deeply regrettable.</p>

<p>The Jingan Temple Road branch of the Shanghai Bank at the Tongfulu intersection in this city has been offering small credit loans for years, with amounts ranging from 50 yuan to 500 yuan, at a monthly interest rate of 7.5%. Those in society who rely on salaries for a living appreciate this relief when needed and have praised it. Recently, with the approach of the Western-style Dragon Boat Festival, people from all walks of life need funds for various purposes. Those who have sought small loans from the bank have come one after another, creating a scene of overwhelming activity. As a result, the amount of small loans issued by the bank has increased sharply, which also reflects the general downturn in society.</p>

<h3>Chongming Autopsy Case: Son-in-Law Detained, Father-in-Law Appeased</h3>
<p>Qiu Chuanlang's daughter, Yin Xian, from Xinkaihe Town, Chongming, was married to Yang Miaolang. After the marriage, she suffered from the demands of the extended family system, facing accusations from her parents-in-law and siblings, making her life miserable. When she was unable to live separately, she committed suicide by hanging herself. However, because there were injuries on her body after death, Qiu Chuanlang sued in the original county, alleging murder, claiming that she was beaten to death and then hanged to cover up the crime. The original county examined the body and ruled it a suicide, dismissing the case. Qiu, dissatisfied, appealed to the High Court, which appointed the Shanghai Local Court to re-examine the body. After sending it to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for autopsy, the result was that although Qiu Yin Xian died by hanging, there were minor injuries on her body. The prosecutor still dismissed the case against Yang Miaolang. Qiu Chuanlang, because there were injuries on his daughter's body, claimed that those responsible for the injuries should also be held accountable. He continued to appeal to the High Court, which sent it back for further investigation. Yesterday, the case was convened, and the official ordered Yang Miaolang to be detained pending legal action. When Qiu Chuanlang heard the order, he said that his daughter's grievances had been redressed and he could die without regret.</p>

<h3>No Ghosts in the New House in Hua'anfang 丨Our Reporter's Investigation Reveals the Truth丨 Three Cement Workers Died of Gas Poisoning After Accidentally Damaging a Gas Pipe, But Rumormongers Created False Stories to Deceive the Public</h3>
<p>Since the night before last, rumors have been rampant that strange and ghostly events have suddenly occurred in the city house at No. 35, Hua'anfang New House, Huaxing Road, North Zhejiang Road. The rumors spread far and wide, and people rushed to investigate, as if it were true. However, when asked for details, no one could provide any proof. Therefore, after an investigation by this newspaper, it was concluded that the rumors were undoubtedly fabricated by mischief-makers, or perhaps there were other motives for creating such unfounded tales to confuse people. However, it is true that two carpenters and one cement worker died suddenly in the house. When a certain grocery store was about to move in, they found that the floorboards were not properly laid, so they hired them to re-lay the floor. The original floorboards were removed, and the cement workers dug into the ground. Seeing that the soil underneath was uneven, they used a nail bar to turn it over. Unexpectedly, there was an old gas pipe buried there. The cement had corroded the pipe, making it old and worn. The carpenters, unaware of this, struck the pipe too hard with the bar, breaking it. The gas immediately rushed out, and the three of them were the first to be hit, collapsing instantly. No one noticed what happened afterward. By the time they were discovered, they had all suffocated to death due to the prolonged exposure to the gas. At the same time, the grocery store, considering it a bad omen, also canceled the move. This is the true story. Unexpectedly, a group of idlers fabricated the facts, spread rumors to deceive the public, and spoke with certainty, as if they had witnessed it themselves. And the ignorant common people, without considering the credibility of the rumors, spread them from person to person, deceiving themselves and others. Perhaps there is another purpose behind this, which is beyond their comprehension. Fortunately, Gong Xi-kui, the district chief of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei, and the Huishi Police Station have both understood the situation. Therefore, in addition to dispatching detectives to secretly investigate the rumormongers and arrest and punish them severely, they have also dispatched armed detectives and regular police to suppress the situation day and night to prevent unscrupulous or reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. At the same time, District Chief Gong will separately investigate and then submit for legal action against the more than ten rioters who were detained for taking the opportunity to cause trouble, beating police officers, and tearing their uniforms on the evening of the sixth (the day before yesterday) in order to maintain public order.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Lianchengfang Will Petition Separately Today</h3>

It is now heard that the representatives of the fang, Qian Jianzhang, Zhou Fuzhen, Liu Genghua, Zhuang Yongtai, and Fan Tianjin, will go to the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:00 AM today to petition for rent reductions and the cessation of sealing up their properties.</p>
<h3>The City's Comedians Form a New Movement Propaganda Team, Going to the Streets and Alleys in Disguise to Give Speeches, Hoping to Inspire People with Humorous Words</h3>
<p>Liu Chunshan, Pei Yanghua, Fan Haha, Lu Qiqi, and others in the city's comedy world, in order to improve their art and inspire social education, have specially organized a Comedy Research Association. Preparations are now complete and it will be established soon.

<h3>Forcing His Wife to Commit Suicide with Phosphorus and Baijiu, Suspecting His Wife of Infidelity Based on Rumors, She Swallowed Poison to Prove Her Innocence and Lost Her Life</h3>
<p>Wang Chuanbin, a native of Hubei, is 34 years old and works as a laborer. He lives at No. 42, Chuanjiazhai, Yangjing, Pudong. He married Li, who is 36 years old. However, Wang is inherently violent, so Li is often blamed, and her smiles turn to tears. The day before yesterday, Wang heard slanderous rumors outside, falsely accusing Li of infidelity. Without investigating, he severely rebuked his wife and peeled off the phosphorus from red-headed matches, mixed it with baijiu, and forced her to commit suicide. He then angrily went out. Li, suffering from this unjust accusation and wanting to prove her innocence, swallowed the mixture. She soon died of a broken heart. The two landlords living with her reported the incident to the Second Branch of the Third District, who detained Wang and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau. They also ordered the Baos to report to the District Court for an autopsy. Prosecutor Wu and others were appointed to the scene, confirmed the cause of death, ordered the body to be collected, and summoned co-residents and neighbors to investigate the details for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Sprinkling Corrosive Acid That Led to Death, Animosity Resulting From Revising An Unacceptable Contract, The Father Died in Anger, The Son Held a Grudge and Sought Revenge</h3>
<p>Shi Jixiang, a native of Jiangbei, was suddenly splashed with nitric acid at around 9:00 PM on the 2nd of last month in front of the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road, causing serious injuries. He was taken to the hospital but died on the 10th despite treatment. After someone reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, it was found that Dong Qingtian, a worker at the Nisshin Cotton Spinning Factory No. 2, was suspected of being involved in the case. While they were investigating, Dong heard about the incident and surrendered to the police station with his lawyer, Song Shixiang. The next morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court, where he denied the charges. He was ordered to be detained pending further investigation. The case has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, it was time for the continuation of the interrogation, but the defendant had already fully confessed to the police station, so the police station officially filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 296 of the Criminal Law for injury resulting in death. Judge Xiao Xie-fen presided over the interrogation in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant hired lawyers Fan Gang and Song Shixiang to defend him. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that the defendant had confessed everything to the police station since the last postponement. As for why he committed such a murder, the matter was trivial and would not be condoned by wise people. Shi Yisheng (the nephew of the deceased), the defendant's brother-in-law, wanted to return to his native Jiangbei to purchase land two years ago and entrusted the defendant's father, Dong Shangbei, to write all the contracts. However, because the wording was inadequate, Shi asked the deceased to review them, and the deceased deemed them unsuitable and revised them. The defendant's father was very dissatisfied, considering it a great insult, and fell ill from anger, eventually dying. Before his death, he told his son, the defendant, that his death was caused by the deceased. Therefore, the defendant held a grudge and committed the murder. On the 1st of last month, the defendant went to the Nisshin Anbu Iron Factory at No. 1034, Lane 44, Gordon Road, and obtained half a bottle of nitric acid from Guo Xiaowuzi, a rickshaw puller, and took it home. At around 7:00 PM the next night, the defendant passed by his brother-in-law Shi Yisheng's house at No. 962 Binlang Road and saw the deceased having dinner. Knowing that the deceased had to pass by Xiaoshadu Road after dinner, he rushed home, got the nitric acid, and hid behind a telephone pole in front of the Labor Hospital. When the deceased and his friend arrived there, the defendant unexpectedly reached out and splashed the acid, then turned around and fled without a trace. The deceased died several days later due to severe injuries. Afterward, the defendant felt guilty and asked for leave from the factory to flee to Wuxi. It was not until the 30th of last month that the defendant surrendered to the police station with his lawyer, Song. At first, he firmly denied the charges, hoping to deceive the authorities, but in the end, the police station found out the facts and summoned various witnesses to testify. The defendant then fully confessed. Now there are nine witnesses, including Shi Jinian, Liu Xitang, and Shi Derun, who can prove that they witnessed the defendant splashing the acid and everything that happened. Then, each witness testified one by one. When questioned, the defendant also confessed to the above situation. After the lawyers on both sides debated, Judge Xiao ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending sentencing on Thursday next week.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Plans to Build a Cemetery for Police Officers Who Died in the Line of Duty, The Address Is Set in Western Shanghai, Covering an Area of Twenty Mu, Construction Will Begin as Soon as the Funds Are Raised</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau is commemorating police officers who died in the line of duty by constructing a monument to them at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Hongxing Road in Zhabei. The unveiling will take place soon. Details have been reported in various newspapers. According to the reporter of Shenshi News Agency's inquiry to the Public Security Bureau, in addition to the monument, there are plans to construct a cemetery for police officers who died in the line of duty. In the past, the families of police officers who died in the line of duty or died from overwork received considerable compensation, but their remains were either unable to be transported back to their hometowns or were scattered in various places, which was not ideal. Therefore, the plan is to build a cemetery to commemorate them and comfort their souls. The address of the cemetery has been selected in western Shanghai, covering an area of approximately twenty mu. During construction, it is planned to surround it with bamboo fences or stone railings, plant pine and cypress trees, and erect a beautifully carved stone archway at the entrance. In the center of the cemetery, a white stone altar will be set up, connected by a path. On both sides will be police officers' tombs, arranged according to surname, so that family members can easily find them when they come to pay their respects. After the cemetery is completed, in addition to transferring all the remains of the already buried police officers, extra spaces will be reserved for future deaths in the line of duty. During important seasons, the bureau will send personnel to sweep and pay respects. The entire project is expected to cost approximately 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. The bureau has already raised 50,000 yuan and is actively raising funds. Construction will begin as soon as the funds are sufficient. ×××</p>
<h3>A Fierce Gunfight During an Arrest on Wangzhi Road, Two Thieves Captured Alive, One Killed, Stray Bullet Injured an Elderly Woman, Condition Critical</h3>
<p>He Kunsheng, a native of Ningbo, lives at No. 4, Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession. He rents out the remaining rooms on the upper floor to three tenants. He Kunsheng runs the Zhongxing Shoe Store on Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession, which is doing well and providing a comfortable life, making him a target for bandits. He's house was robbed once during the lunar New Year this year, with more than 800 yuan in cash stolen. Unexpectedly, at around 10:30 AM yesterday morning, nine more bandits, dressed in various outfits, armed with weapons, broke into He's house through the back door, ordering the downstairs tenants and servants to remain silent and herding them into one room. One bandit monitored their movements, two guarded the front and back doors, and the other six rushed upstairs to He's bedroom, intending to start searching. However, He Kunsheng had already woken up and quickly opened the window, shouting for the police to arrest the thieves. Tao Delin, the doorman of the lane, heard the call and bravely rushed over with his gun. With the assistance of a vegetable vendor, he captured two bandits guarding the door. The other bandits, realizing that things were not going well, rushed out, fleeing east on Wangzhi Road. Nearby detectives who had heard the alert arrived one after another, chasing after them. The bandits scattered and fled in all directions on Wangzhi Road. One bandit entered the roof of the Shengtai Wood Shop at No. 190 and took the initiative to open fire with a pistol to resist arrest. The detectives below returned fire, and the gunshots cracked and popped like dense beads, as if facing a major enemy. As a result, the bandit was shot in a vital spot, falling to the ground and dying. The bandit was wearing a white shirt and shorts, and a pistol was seized. At that time, a stray bullet hit an elderly woman buying vegetables in the chest, causing profuse bleeding and serious injuries. Afterward, the French Police called an ambulance to rush the injured woman to the hospital for treatment. Her life is in critical condition. The other six bandits took the opportunity to escape from the rooftops and other places. The two captured bandits were taken back for interrogation, and they confessed the names of many accomplices. The investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Daughter of "Little Fool" Sues Her Husband for Assault, Husband Cai Xiaobai Appeals to the Court</h3>
<p>Wu Xue-li, the beloved daughter of Wu Bai-fen, the famous fortune teller "Little Fool" from Changzhou (formerly located at Xiaohuayuan, Zhejiang Road, now moved to Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road), is 32 years old and a well-known socialite. She was involved in a marriage dispute in the First Special District Court, which caused a sensation. Later, because "Times Daily" published disparaging information about Wu, Wu turned to Cai Xiao-bai, a famous lawyer from Hangzhou who had just returned from studying in Europe, to ask him to negotiate with "Times Daily". As a result, Wu and Cai met day and night, and in their discussions, they found each other to be very compatible, feeling as if they had met each other too late. They developed from friendship to love and marriage. Through the introduction of lawyer Wu Kai-sheng and the wedding officiation of Xue Du-bi, they were married at the YMCA in Baxianqiao on April 29 of last year. Afterward, they lived together at No. 137 Maishaerti Road, French Concession. However, after marriage, the couple often quarreled over minor incidents, leading to small quarrels every three days and major quarrels every five days. In September of last year, the two had a conflict over a minor matter, and Wu Xue-li actually resorted to violence, beating Cai and causing injuries. Cai was treated at Huilv Hospital on Avenue Edward VII and stayed in the hospital for recuperation. At that time, their feelings for each other were as incompatible as fire and water. After being persuaded by relatives and friends, Wu Xue-li wrote a letter of repentance, stating that she would never quarrel with Xiao-bai again, (1) not resort to violence, (2) not destroy any objects, (3) not hide any of Xiao-bai's professional documents, and that if she went back on her word, Xiao-bai could dispose of her as he pleased. From then on, the two reconciled. However, before long, Wu's behavior relapsed, often making things difficult for Xiao-bai. Xiao-bai, embarrassed, endured it and did not argue. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM on the 25th of last month, the two quarreled again over a minor matter. Wu Xue-li threw a porcelain basin at Xiao-bai, hitting his left eye and forehead. He immediately reported it to the French Police, and Detective Peng Shitian (transliteration) from the West District went to investigate. According to the woman, Xiao-bai grabbed her hair for no reason, threw her to the ground, and kicked her body, left cheek, and lower abdomen. According to Cai Xiao-bai, Xue-li hid his documents for no reason and refused to hand them over. When he demanded them, she resorted to violence. Therefore, the police summoned both parties to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday morning. The police charged Wu Xue-li with Article 293 of the Criminal Law. Wu Xue-li did not appear for the hearing. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the police station stated the case, saying that both parties had accused each other of assault at the police station, so both parties were summoned. Since Wu Xue-li did not appear, he requested that the hearing be postponed. Then, Cai Xiao-bai recounted the cause of the quarrel, saying that the defendant Wu Xue-li was using lawsuits to coerce him into divorcing her. This time, she hid his case files for no reason, preventing him from working, and deliberately provoked him. After the incident, she avoided appearing in court. He requested that a warrant be issued to arrest her and bring her to court for questioning. The judge asked Cai if he had ever hit Wu Xue-li. Cai replied that she was the only one who hit him, and he had never hit her, and that there were witnesses to prove it. After reviewing the statements, Judge Wu Fang-lian ordered the hearing to be postponed for ten days and the defendant to be summoned to court again. He also ordered Cai to submit to a forensic examination to verify the injuries.</p>
<h3>One Point of the Finger Caused the Little Owner of a Congee Shop to Bleed to Death, The Strange Case in Laiyi Ferry, Pudong, Autopsy Results Revealed No Wounds on the Body, Second Autopsy Required Before Inquiry Can Continue</h3>
<p>Su Huilan, a Kunqu opera star known for her leading roles on the Ping opera stage at Pudong Grand Theater in Laiyi Ferry, Pudong, has a beautiful appearance and a clear voice, earning her praise from the audience. Her parents are both alive, and the family rents a house north of the theater. Every day, her parents follow her closely, inseparable. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, Su finished her performance, removed her makeup, and returned home, walking slightly behind her parents. When she reached the entrance of the congee shop at No. 145 Beishou Street, owned by Zhu Chengjiang from Chongming, she was seen by a diner who made frivolous remarks. Su was very angry and complained to her father. Her father, Su Weikun, returned to the shop and sternly questioned the diner. The small shop owner, Zhu Yougui, came out to apologize. Suddenly, a diner wearing blue cloth clothes and pants punched Su's father. Weikun was even more angry and returned to the theater to call for help. Many opera actors, all burly men, rushed over. By this time, the person who threw the punch had already fled. Seeing the trouble, the small shop owner was very flustered and was about to explain to those who came when one of the opera actors pointed his finger and blamed the small shop owner for letting the assailant go. Unexpectedly, in that instant, the small shop owner suddenly fell forward, bleeding from his nose, and lost consciousness. The police officer on duty arrived and immediately took Su's father, Weikun, to the Third District. At the same time, he ordered the family to carry the small shop owner to Pudong Hospital for treatment, but he soon died. District Chief Zhang of the Third District said that according to the information obtained from the defendant, he did not hit the person, so the cause of death was very strange. Yesterday, he ordered the Bao Chief to report to the District Court for an autopsy to clarify the truth. After this incident occurred, nearby residents discussed it, many saying that the opera actors had the skill of acupressure, or that the deceased was too flustered at the time, causing blood to rush to his brain and causing death, which is also unknown. Later, the court appointed a prosecutor to go to Pudong to conduct an autopsy in the hospital. The deceased's father, Zhu Chengjiang, claimed that the deceased was his third son, 30 years old, and insisted that he was punched to death by the person who was invited. He left behind a wife and a son. He is old, and the store affairs are all managed by the deceased. Now the store is closed and no one takes care of it. He requested justice. The judge examined the body and found no wounds on the surface, seeming to be caused by excessive nervous shock. Since the deceased's father said he was beaten to death, he ordered the defendant to be taken to the hospital and to conduct a second autopsy on the body before conducting a further inquiry.</p>
<h3>The Lianhe Wheel Sustained Engine Damage in Nantong and Returned to Shanghai for Repairs, Carelessly Turning the Ship and Damaging the Engine, Cargo and Passengers Transferred to Longhe</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson's Changjiang class Lianhe ship, which was traveling from Shanghai to Hankou, damaged its engine when it struck a rock mid-journey. The ship was unable to continue to Hankou. The cargo and passengers have been transferred to the Longhe wheel. The Lianhe wheel returned to Shanghai for major repairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Lianhe wheel of Jardine Matheson</p>
<p>Damaged Wheel departed from Shanghai on the 5th of this month to transport cargo to Hankou. Because Dasheng Yarn Factory in Nantong had a batch of cotton yarn to be shipped to Hankou on the ship, the Lianhe wheel stopped in Tongzhou to load the yarn. After loading was completed, the ship left Nantong. When raising the anchor, it was necessary to turn the ship around. There are many shallow sandbars and reefs in this area, making it very difficult to turn the ship. The Lianhe accidentally, the engine blade at the stern of the ship, collided with a rock on the riverbank. Fortunately, the wheel was a twin-engine wheel, and one blade was destroyed on the spot, but it was still able to continue sailing.</p>
<p>Continued, After the engine blade of the wheel was damaged, because there was still</p>
<p>Town, The wheel could barely operate with one blade, but the speed had been greatly reduced, making it difficult to reach Hankou. The ship owner telegraphed the Shanghai office for instructions and was allowed to sail to Zhenjiang, transfer the cargo and passengers, and return to Shanghai for major repairs. The Lianhe wheel sailed from Tongzhou to Zhenjiang and anchored to wait. The company's Longhe wheel went upstream to Zhenjiang. The cargo and passengers of Lianhe were transferred to the Longhe, which continued to Hankou. The Lianhe was emptied and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>This afternoon, The Shanghai office received a telegram from Zhenjiang yesterday afternoon, indicating that the Lianhe's cargo and passengers had been completely transferred to the Longhe, transported to Hankou, and would sail back to Shanghai from Zhenjiang that evening. Because the journey was delayed, it was expected to enter the port this afternoon. After arriving in Shanghai, the company will inspect the extent of the damage and then proceed to dock for repairs. The wheel's scheduled trips will be temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>A Man in a Western Suit Committed Suicide by Jumping into the Huangpu River, The Body Has Been Found</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 PM on the 5th, the Central Police Station of the Public Concession notified the Customs Water Police Station by telephone that a man in a Western suit jumped into the Huangpu River and committed suicide at the Bund Wharf. A passerby, Xu Fubao, witnessed it and only recovered a straw hat. The Water Police Station immediately sent personnel to take the hat back and instructed the Chinese and Western police to pay attention to the body floating up at any time. The day before yesterday afternoon, a male body in a Western suit floated near the Jinliyuan Wharf in the French Concession. The Water Police retrieved the body, which was wearing white clothes and was about twenty years old. The body was sent to the Salvation Bureau for collection. Investigations are underway to identify the body.</p>
<h3>A Worker Committed Suicide Due to Poverty and Illness</h3>
<p>Liu Guanquan, a worker residing at No. 126 Laobosen Road in Western Shanghai, was in his thirties. His family lived in the countryside, and they relied on Liu's income for their livelihood. However, due to poverty and illness, life became difficult, which was like a death warrant. He resented his fate and hanged himself the night before last. He was discovered yesterday morning, and the Sixth District Police Station instructed Bao Chief Cai Fuson to report to the District Court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Zhang Naiqi Discusses Man and Environment</h3>
<p>The Chinese Staff Association of the Public Works Department held its second academic lecture yesterday at the Public Works Department Hygiene Sub-Office at No. 340 Hankou Road. They invited Mr. Zhang Naiqi, President of the China Industrial Bank, to lecture on Man and Environment. More than one hundred people attended. Jin Baisheng presided over the meeting, and Bingxun Stenography Society took shorthand notes. The lecture stated that man and environment are like heroes and times. Examples like the Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights from the ancient book "Water Margin" and modern figures like Mussolini and Hitler can all be considered heroes, but these are reactionary heroes of despotism, dictatorship, jumping over walls, and throwing bombs, which are not in line with the times. Generally, people are often influenced by historical education and heroism, so they often have the word "hero" in their minds, but each person's view of a hero is different. However, whether a hero can create the times or the times create a hero is a matter of debate. Most young people believe that a hero can create the times, but once they enter society, they feel the difficulty of transforming the times. Some people believe that a hero cannot create the times, but the times can create a hero, meaning that people are limited by their environment and that a hero has no place to use his talents if the time is not right. This kind of statement is just a general excuse for unsuccessful people to cover up their own faults and console themselves. Modern ethical science says that although a person's future is subject to the environment, a person's efforts can advance the environment, meaning that although a person's path is determined by the environment, a person can shorten the route through effort. This theory is very accurate. Therefore, we should use the environment, advance the environment, and within the realm of possibility, not let the opportunity pass. Hu Shi said that China would not perish in fifty years, and Japan would perish on its own. Zhang Boquan said that Japan would have a revolution and perish on its own in ten years. If China strives to advance, then the day of Japan's demise will come sooner, and China can be revived earlier. This is the meaning of times and heroes, that is, man and environment.</p>

<p>The Fenghua Natives Association in Shanghai held a regular meeting yesterday. Those present included Chen Siyu, Chen Zhonggao, Zhang Nanhua, Wang Shijia, Wang Zhangxing, etc. Chen Siyu was publicly elected as chairman, and Wu Chongzhen served as the recorder. The meeting proceeded with customary rituals, and the following reports and proposals were discussed: (1) Report on the association's activities. Zhuo Zhulan, a woman, was escorted by a bailiff from Nanhui County to the association, along with a judgment document. Her mother-in-law, Zhuo Zhang, came to the association to claim her. Director Chen Zhonggao generously provided travel expenses for the bailiff and assisted the mother and daughter-in-law with their travel back to their hometown. (2) Member Zhang Futu came to the association to request assistance for his fellow townsman, Zhang Baoliang, who was going to Singapore to work as a carpenter, and Sun Zhongmao, who was going to Penang to work. Both of them needed letters of introduction for passport applications to work abroad. It was decided to send letters to the British Consulate and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for assistance in issuing passports. (3) Fellow townsman Zhu Huajin came to the association, stating that his relative, Shan Jipin, was falsely accused of kidnapping by his wife, Wu, and was detained in court. He requested relief and assistance. Based on this, the legal counsel, lawyer Yu Hualong, was entrusted to defend him, and the court ruled him not guilty. (4) Fellow townsman Sun Yongnian came to the association, stating that his father, Sun Jingyu, who served as an ordnance officer in the 6th Regiment of the Fujian Provincial Security Team, was killed by mutinous soldiers of the 1st Company while returning to his post. Yongnian should fulfill his filial duty by going to Fujian to bring his father's coffin back to their hometown and requested a letter to local police officers for protection. It was decided to send a letter to the Fujian Provincial Police Bureau to instruct the police to provide protection. (5) Member Chen Caifu came to the association, stating that he carelessly caused a fire on the overhanging building at the entrance of Hongmao Lane on South Railway Station Road, which spread to the coal baskets placed under the building by members. Unexpectedly, the residents of the overhanging building falsely accused the member's partner, Ye Weishui, of endangering public safety and detained him for transfer to the court, requesting assistance and relief. It was decided to entrust legal counsel Yu Hualong to prepare a defense and send a letter to the Shanghai Jiangsu Local Court, requesting a fair trial to avoid injustice. (6) The association compiled the fifth edition of the member directory, which was printed by the Nanyang Printing Company. The company was scheduled to complete the printing and deliver it to the association this week. The proposal was to decide how to distribute the directory to the members. It was decided that those living far away would receive it by mail, while those living nearby would have it delivered by the teahouse. The meeting discussed over sixty cases of relief, mediation, and assistance, too many to detail. After the discussions, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Deaf and Mute Old Woman Killed Crossing Tracks</h3>
<p>In Qingning Temple, Pudong, at 5 PM on the 6th of this month, Qin Shen, a 52-year-old woman who was deaf and mute, was shopping at Wan Shun Sauce Garden. At that time, a Shangchuan bus was coming from the south, sounding its horn frequently. The woman did not hear it due to her deafness and crossed the tracks. The driver immediately braked, but it was too late, and she was hit, resulting in her death at the scene. The company reported the incident to the 9th Precinct of the 3rd District of the Public Security Bureau and notified the local bailiff to report to the Shanghai Local Court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Station</h3>
<p>Wu Chongren's storytelling broadcast. The Jingwu Physical Education Third Branch at the intersection of Luban Road and Ximen Road has been promoting martial arts with great effort since its establishment and has long been renowned in society. Since the reorganization in 1928, under the leadership of Qiu Ziqing and Wu Chongren, the association's affairs have been developing rapidly. They have spared no effort in expanding the curriculum, renovating the existing gardens, and adding bathhouses and other facilities for physical and mental cultivation, striving for perfection. Recently, they have added free classes to benefit those with limited resources. However, due to financial constraints, the association plans to raise 10,000 yuan to inject funds. They have obtained the consent of Mr. Wu Chongren to broadcast for major companies and factories in the city, with a monthly fee of 1,000 yuan, all of which will be donated to the association's funds. It is heard that Meilong Qingliao Factory, Yongsheng Peppermint Factory, Unique Specialty Factory, and Aihua Pharmaceutical Company, etc., have jointly invested 1,000 yuan to hire Mr. Wu to broadcast. Mr. Wu is a giant of the Guangyu Society and was once famous in Suzhou and Shanghai. Later, he devoted himself to medicine and stopped storytelling for a long time. Now, to promote martial arts, he is sacrificing himself and meeting with the people again. It is expected that he will cause a sensation in Shanghai and bring a different color to storytelling.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Chen Xiaobao, who stated that he read in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 30th of last month an article about Shen Ahong being arrested, which mentioned multiple accomplices, including Chen Xiaobao, etc., which was very shocking. Upon investigation, it is found that there are countless people in our country with the same surname and given name, which does not need to be debated. Moreover, Xiaobao travels to Shanghai to do business and also holds a position in a shipping company. He has never participated in any political party activities, nor has he taken any transgressive actions. The person referred to in the article is likely someone else, or it is a misunderstanding of hearsay. However, fearing that distant rumors will be misinterpreted, causing misunderstandings, and because the article involves suspicion of being reactionary, which is of great importance, he has to declare and defend himself. For this reason, he has entrusted your lawyer to write to various newspapers to declare the above. My client, Chen Xiaobao, is from eastern Zhejiang and has been employed in a commercial shipping company for several years. He has always been law-abiding and does not participate in political party activities. I hereby write to you on his behalf to declare the above. This is addressed to the Shanghai Newspaper. Lawyer Yang Shaozhi, June 7th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I have just read in your newspaper a news item about the Xixin'an Temple in Nanshi being harassed by itinerant monks, which does not quite correspond to the facts. This temple is a private temple of Shouleng and Shoushen, mainly for quiet meditation and chanting Buddha, and has no contact with the outside world. After Shoushen passed away, Shouleng presided over it for more than thirty years. The so-called Jianci nun is only staying temporarily in the temple, not the abbess. When the itinerant monks first came to harass the temple, in order to maintain the temple rules, Jianci was immediately ordered to leave the temple and was taken away by her original introducer, the Li family. Everything is unrelated to this temple. Your newspaper's report is inaccurate and concerns the reputation of this temple. I dare to write this letter without hesitation to declare and hope that it will be published in your newspaper's letter column for correction. Thank you very much. Xixin'an Temple Abbot Shouleng respectfully.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: The news about "The Rent Increase Wave in Penglai Market" published in your newspaper on the 4th of this month is completely inconsistent with the facts. The houses in this market were originally priced at 30 yuan per room when they were completed in March 1920. At that time, Shen Hengzhuang, Shanghai Shoe Room, Penglai Coffee Shop, and Wuzhou Pharmacy, etc., all agreed to rent them. Later, in May, when national product manufacturers joined, Chen Maiyun of Sanyou Industrial Society, Fang Jiange of China Enamel Factory, Li Xinpu of Family Industrial Society, and Pan Dechun of Renchangyong Material Factory, etc., negotiated with us, saying that they were all here to promote national products and reduce prices, and persuaded us to also reduce the house rental prices. Therefore, it was agreed that the rent for the 1920 year would be reduced to 10 yuan per room, and then increase by 5 yuan per room each year, with the expectation of making up the original 30 yuan in five years. This is an agreement reached between the landlord who extraordinarily reduced the price of the house in advance to accommodate the tenants, and the tenants who confirmed that they would gradually make up the original rent, and a contract and lease were signed, clearly stating that it is completely different from the ordinary rent increase situation. For this reason, most of the shops in this market who understand the truth still pay the rent monthly as agreed, without interruption. In the current situation, it seems like a rent increase, but based on the agreement, it cannot be said to be a rent increase in general. I especially ask you to correct this to clarify the facts and correct the hearing. I am deeply grateful. This is addressed to the editor of the Shanghai Newspaper, Penglai Market Preparatory Office, June 7, 1934.</p>
<p>Gratitude. I thank the Ministry of Railways for the gift of "Catalog of Books in the Library of the Ministry of Railways" and the Commercial Press for the gift of the 11th issue of the 32nd volume of Children's World and the 40th volume of Children's Pictorial. I write this to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On the Contradictions of Life丨丨Answering Questions from Li Qing, He Guofen, and Luo Guangtao 1. The Question's Origin</h3>
<p>This question was first raised by Mr. Li, and later letters were received from Mr. He and Mr. Luo, all seriously requesting a scientific understanding of this question. Mr. He said: "Although this is a very ordinary question, it is a question that all young people want to understand, because the life of modern Chinese youth is too contradictory. Confucianists are distressed and confused in contradiction, and the brave either hold their heads high and move forward regardless of everything for their goals, or, on the contrary, commit suicide happily." Indeed, this is a serious question that has been forgotten and needs to be scientifically addressed. Now, the questions raised by Mr. Li and others are revealed below:</p>
<p>1. Is the contradiction of life a kind of morbidity, a deviation from the norm of life?</p>
<p>2. How to explain the contradiction between a person's thoughts and actions, the contradiction between thoughts and thoughts, and the contradiction between actions and actions? 3. How to overcome contradictions in behavior?</p>
<p>3. The phenomenon of contradictions in life is determined by the contradictions in the life process itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo deeply blames himself for the contradictions in his life, highly praises, and envies a life without contradictions. He hopes that his life can be like a pool of autumn water, completely eliminating contradictions. Needless to say, he denies that a reasonable life would have contradictions. Mr. Luo cited many ancient sages and wise men to prove that the lives of great personalities are completely without contradictions? A life with contradictions is only the life of ordinary people. Are these words completely correct? Of course, they are not correct. Because Mr. Luo sees life as too simple and abstract. He ignores that the life process itself is a process of contradiction and struggle. Life is nothing more than the continuation of contradictions, and the contradictory phenomena manifested in behavior only illustrate the contradiction and struggle of life itself. This has nothing to do with the inferiority or superiority of people, and there is no mystery involved.</p>
<p>However, where does the root of this mistake of Mr. Luo lie? This is undoubtedly due to the following reasons. Because society despises the contradictory phenomena in a person's life, and uses contradictions as a tool to weigh or attack people. Therefore, only those who are straightforward like Mr. Li, Mr. He, and Mr. Luo are willing to confess the contradictions in their own lives, and others are unwilling to easily admit it. Some people have to wait until their contradictions are noticed by others before they blush, half-swallowingly, and reluctantly admit it in shyness. Some people pretend to be "solemn and inviolable," claiming that they have no contradictions in their lives. In fact, this is all social hypocrisy. Since the life process is a process of contradiction and struggle, not having contradictions means not having a life. Ordinary people always tend to imagine that a great person is different from ordinary people in everything, which is completely a misunderstanding. He ignores that since he is a person, he must have the commonality of human beings, and at the same time, he also has his uniqueness. There is an old saying in China that "heroes are often ordinary people," which reveals the truth. Because heroes are originally people, although they have extraordinary aspects, they should also have the general qualities of ordinary people. Otherwise, they will all turn into supermen. If we break this concept, whether the contradictions in our lives are on the surface of behavior or "internal," we don't need to keep them secret, nor do we need to think it is a shameful thing. It is not a morbidity of life, nor is it out of the norm of life. It is just a very ordinary phenomenon in the life process. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Special Article: A Refutation of Foreign Misinterpretations of the Pilotage Treaty (6): Declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the China Pilotage Association</h3>
<p>Furthermore, what we want these journalists to understand clearly is that the 1868 regulations, in any case, were regulations that China willingly and voluntarily established. They were a form of China's internal affairs. We have endured this burden for sixty-six years. Even without the January 28th Incident, we were already determined that we could no longer tolerate it. Therefore, today, our government's clear order to reclaim pilotage rights and abolish the Tongzhi 7th Year Regulations is not only a wise internal policy that the government should implement, but it also truly represents the genuine public opinion of all of China. Therefore, no matter what kind of sophistry or curses these journalists engage in, since we cannot find any basis in the treaties, we can only regard the speakers as hypocritical, deceptive, and simply cursing.</p>
<p>We still have something to say to these journalists: what we know is that national rights are above all else, and nothing else can be compared to them, let alone foreign shipping companies. Speaking of the tonnage of ships entering and leaving Shanghai, fortunately, China still has six million tons; otherwise, according to the journalists' intention, wouldn't even the Huangpu River have to be ceded to foreigners? The journalists of this publication also threaten that if China reclaims pilotage rights in the future, foreign ships will dock at Wusong. This shows the journalists' lack of common sense. Generally speaking, progress is normal, while going backward is abnormal. The Shanghai docks have already been developed to such an extent. Perhaps only the journalists of this publication have this kind of insight to advise them to abandon this and choose that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding this publication's slander of Chinese pilots, the publication repeatedly asserts that Chinese pilots do not possess even the minimum level of foreign pilot trainees. We initially do not know on what basis they say this. Furthermore, their discussions of piloting skills, etc., are superficial and can only be used to deceive laymen. Therefore, what we want to announce to all countries and sectors is that, standing in the position of pilots, we are very willing to accept this publication's criticism of "local knowledge and the method of pointing." This is because we believe that what the job of a pilot requires is precisely familiarity with all local conditions (such as water depth, currents, wind direction effects, etc.), supplemented by considerable ship-handling experience, which is sufficient. Anything else is just deceptive talk. Because after the ship enters the port, even the simplest bearing in ordinary navigation is unnecessary. The only piloting method is the method of pointing, that is, where the bow points and where the stern points, which is already sufficient. For example, when entering the Wusongkou, the bow must face the Wusong Lighthouse and be aligned with the light beacon in front of the tower to ensure a minimum water depth of thirty feet. Also, for example, when entering the port near Chenjiazhui at night, when approaching the light beacon opposite Chenjiazhui, one must wait until the light on the north side of Donggou is fully exposed before changing the needle to steer towards the center of the channel to obtain the deepest draft. There are countless other similar examples, and it is unnecessary to list them all. Such a method is the method of pointing. We have not been in contact with foreign pilots and do not know how much better they are than us. If the journalists of this publication would not hesitate to teach us, we would be very welcome.</p>
<p>Finally, we have heard a rumor that last year, a certain port in China held a pilot examination, and a Chinese person took the exam and achieved excellent results. Thereupon, a certain foreign examiner raised an objection and strongly demanded that this person be re-examined. At that time, the chairman said, "Why didn't you ask during the exam and insist on asking after the exam? This is unfair and unacceptable." Thereupon, the foreigner raised the difficulty that the Chinese person did not have the ability to pilot and navigate. Unexpectedly, this angered the manager of the pilot association, who said to the foreigner, "A pilot only needs to have all the local knowledge and ship-handling skills, and the rest is just talk. Even if our great ability to pilot and navigate is very good, we still break ships and sink ships. I think your countrymen are the same. Take away their piloting and navigation skills." If this rumor is reliable, then the journalists of this publication can rest easy. Perhaps the minds of sailors are simple, and in an unfair situation, they will speak out with justice and truth, unlike those hypocritical gentlemen who hold the Bible in their left hand and the butcher knife in their right, wanting to kill people and pretending to act on behalf of heaven.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have to say something incessantly, that is, there are several important ports in the United Kingdom, such as Liverpool, where the number of ships entering and leaving and the congestion of waterways in the port are even greater than in Shanghai Port. However, the qualifications of their pilots do not necessarily require them to have been captains. This is a fact. The journalist is British. How can he not know about his own country's affairs? Why doesn't he mention it in his article? Isn't he trying to deceive the audience with alarming words to sell his cunning? We also know that once this kind of fact is revealed, it will become dull and tasteless. However, because of the relationship that blood is thicker than water, we have to express our sincere feelings to the journalists of this publication, and these are just straightforward words. (The End)</p>

<h3>Records of the Lingering Fragrance of the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The name of the nine-tone gong (九音鑼) comes from the distinct tones produced by its nine small copper gongs. My particular admiration for it stems from the sweetness and remarkable charm of its sound. It's played by gently striking the gongs with a thin wooden stick, which has a hard wooden ball, about the size of an abacus bead, attached to its end. This hard wood creates an especially clear and resonant tone.</p>
<p>The nine distinct sounds of the nine-tone gong correspond to the nine musical notes actually used in ancient Chinese musical notation, much like the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 used today. These are represented by the characters 工, 四, 上, 尺, 五, 一, 六, 萬, and 合. How these nine characters came to be selected for musical notation and what meanings they hold are questions I cannot answer. Beyond myself, perhaps most people couldn't answer them either. This is because the origins are long past, and everyone just learns the old tunes without bothering to delve into the underlying reasons.</p>
<p>Next is the sheng (笙). Among Chinese musical instruments, the sheng is considered one of the oldest and most unique. Its shape resembles a Buddha's hand. It has twenty-four slender bamboo pipes, each of a different length, with small holes along their sides. The player blows into a car-handle-like base while simultaneously pressing and releasing these small holes with their fingers. Like the nine-tone gong, this produces various distinct sounds corresponding to the nine musical notes mentioned earlier. However, due to the slenderness of the bamboo pipes, the sound can't be very high, and playing it is very tiring for the player. (52)</p>
<h3>Old Man Wang the Eighth</h3>
<p>— Yu Wen</p>
<p>Before the January 28th Incident, Old Man Wang the Eighth would come to my place every two or three days to have his clothes washed. After the Shanghai battle, I moved, and I haven't seen the old man since.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Old Man Wang the Eighth, there's something admirable about him. In his younger days, he was a sailor on an ocean liner, had been to various European and American countries, and could speak fluent English. He was very amiable and diligent. Although he was old, he didn't act like it. Even when people called him "Old Wang Ba" (Old Turtle), he didn't argue with them. Although he had been abroad and could speak foreign languages, he didn't show off in front of others. If he saw foreign police officers bullying people for no reason, or drunken foreign sailors hitting people at will, he would step forward to interfere and reason with them. He didn't wear Western suits, didn't speak foreign languages, didn't like Western ways, and didn't like to use foreign goods. He wore homespun clothes and used Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Although Old Man Wang was a good person, his two sons were unfilial. They both sold Japanese goods! Perhaps it was because they were of mixed race? It turns out that Old Man Wang's wife was a foreign woman he brought back from England years ago.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I ran into Old Man Wang on the street, whom I hadn't seen for a long time. After we parted, I learned that his "foreign goods" wife had died. After the January 28th Incident, his two "mixed-race" sons continued their Japanese goods business. Old Man Wang repeatedly tried to persuade them not to, but they wouldn't listen, and now he has separated from them.</p>
<p>Later, I thought that Old Man Wang was really admirable. The modern men and women who love to use foreign goods are not as good as him! But when I thought of Old Man Wang's sons still working as traitors, I couldn't help but curse twice, "Dog bastards!"</p>
<h3>Visiting the Horse</h3>
<p>— Friend of Bo Le (A mythical horse connoisseur)</p>
<p>In the "Brief Biographies of People" column on the 18th of last month, there was an article by Xun Ziju, "A Record of a Talent," which was about a student who had studied at Tokyo Imperial University. Fearing that no one would consult him after returning to China, he did not want to return to the country and only wanted to live his life in Japan as an "old student" (a simplified name for old overseas students). He studied chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. He could make his own cosmetics to help with his living expenses.</p>
<p>In the article, the author attributed this deformed situation to the country and society, believing that it was "a feeling of a fine horse not meeting Bo Le!" In fact, there are many Bo Les in society who are looking for fine horses!</p>
<p>Now, a famous figure in the domestic goods industry, after seeing this article, felt endless sympathy for this fine horse who was not meeting his opportunity. He intends to seek out this fine horse so that he can develop his talent for a thousand miles.</p>
<p>However, because Xun Ziju did not write down his friend's name and address, this Mr. Bo Le can only hold his whip and shout, "A fine horse is far away in the sky, looking out to Fusang, where can I find it?" Horse oh horse? Will it return?</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the author of the article, Xun Ziju, after seeing this newspaper, will inform us of someone's communication address so that we can tell Mr. Bo Le, so that Bo Le can get the horse and the horse can meet Bo Le, wouldn't that be wonderful!

<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Watching the Wailing Wild Geese, Guarding the Country with Buried Heads, Bullets Piercing Firmly, Blood Staining the Lonely City</p>
<p>Although he was silent, he also understood a great deal. It was as if someone was telling him in the dark that war was coming, that the foreshadowing of war was like this. From here, further imagining what the future of the war would be like was also conceivable. But as Ziqiang was in such a trance, he felt a gust of cool wind blowing past the corner of his mouth. This gust of wind served as a great warning to him. He followed up and remembered that he had just sworn an oath with the battalion commander to serve the country with utmost loyalty. Now, the blood from his mouth had not yet dried, and he was already thinking about how terrible the war was. For a soldier, fighting is his natural duty, so what is there to be afraid of? This is like a person who flies an airplane. Can you say that flying an airplane is scary? Thinking this, he puffed out his chest, cheered up, returned to his company headquarters, and continued his usual tasks. Nothing happened that night. The next day, after morning exercises and lectures, everyone seemed to be fine. At eleven o'clock, the brothers were in small groups, each holding a piece of corn bread made from mixed flour, squatting on the ground for lunch. At this moment, a buzzing sound occurred overhead. All the brothers had experienced war before. How could they not understand what this kind of sound meant? It was clear that the enemy's planes had arrived. Therefore, everyone was still listening with their ears pricked up while sending the corn bread in their hands to their mouths to hear the location of the sound. Fortunately, there were squad leaders supervising them, and when they saw this situation, they immediately shouted, "Eat, eat, what are you listening to? Listening is this situation, and not listening is this situation. After we are full, we still have to do our job." The officer said this, and the soldiers lowered their heads and ate. But at this moment, there was a earth-shaking sound, and a bomb landed and exploded. How would the villagers know how to avoid airplanes? Everyone started crying and shouting. (403)</p>

<h3>Li Shizeng of the World Society Sends Off Eleven Young Children to Study Abroad: They Set Off Yesterday to the International School in Geneva</h3>
<p>The World Society at 393 Fuxing Road, this city, held a farewell luncheon yesterday afternoon for thirteen Chinese teachers and students from World Schools going to Europe. Mr. Li Shizeng, a committee member, hosted the banquet.</p>
<p>This is likely the first time that Chinese children have been sent to study in Europe, starting with young students. A luncheon was held in the morning, and they boarded the ship at 6 PM in the afternoon to go abroad. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Present: The World Society held a luncheon yesterday afternoon to bid farewell to Chinese teachers and students from World Schools. In addition to the thirteen teachers and students, the attendees included invited guests and student parents. Among the Chinese and foreign guests present were Mona, a consultant to the National Economic Commission; Secretary Ma Su; Committee Member Zhang Jingjiang and his wife; Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee; the wife of Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin; Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner Lu Zhong'an; and famous opera performers Cheng Yanqiu and Qi Yunqing, totaling over a hundred people.</p>
<p>Luncheon Details: The host and guests toasted each other at the banquet, creating a joyful atmosphere that lasted until after 1 PM. At the same time, a simple examination was held for the students, requiring each student to write their name and address at the Geneva school in Western languages, and to write a travel itinerary in Chinese. An oral exam was also conducted.</p>
<p>Names of Teachers and Students: The first and second group of students going to Geneva include teachers Mr. Pan, Mr. Xiang, Mr. Xie, and Mrs. Xie Hu, along with the following students: Lu Woruo (female, Hebei, 9 years old), Lu Furuo (female, Hebei, 10 years old), Hu Xiangxiong (male, Jiangsu, 10 years old), Xu Lianzi (female, Anhui, 10 years old), Zhang Naiqi (female, Zhejiang, 12 years old), Cheng Yongguang (male, Hebei, 10 years old), Jia Zhizhai (male, Hebei, 9 years old), Jiang Shuozhi (male, Hubei, 12 years old), Jiang Shuoping (male, Hubei, 11 years old), Qi Xiru (female, Hebei, 11 years old), and Qi Xiyao (female, Hebei, 9 years old), totaling eleven students.</p>
<p>Shipboard Curriculum: The course items designated to take place en route to Geneva are as follows (1) Chinese Language, (2) English, (3) Travel Knowledge, and (4) Journal.</p>
<p>Daily Schedule: 6:00 AM: Wake up, wash, take a walk, breakfast; 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM: English; 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM: Chinese Language; 12:00 PM: Lunch; 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM: Travel Knowledge; 6:00 PM: Dinner; 7:00 PM: Journal; 8:30 PM or 9:00 PM: Bedtime.</p>
<p>Report by Mr. Li: Mr. Li Shizeng, a committee member, gave a brief report at the farewell banquet, saying, "This report is titled 'A Report on World Schools...' What does this mean? It is a very simple overall report on the various organizations and issues of World Schools. A detailed explanation would not be possible given the limited space and time. However, saying only two things would be too incomplete. Therefore, I must use the style of 'concise and comprehensive.' Having defined this, I can briefly describe each section and item as follows:</p>
<p>World School: This school is located in Geneva, named École Internationale in French and International School in English. It has a history of many years, with dozens of teachers and hundreds of students of dozens of nationalities. The languages studied are English, French, and German. If the students are not nationals using these three languages, they will, of course, review and improve their native language. The purpose of this school is not only to have a global vision but also to be a factual product in an international environment. Switzerland is a key area in the international environment of Europe, and China is also a key area in the international environment. Although their natures are different, the need for several languages and global education has the same factual result. Therefore, China is a comrade country of the World School in Geneva, and there is a need to establish a World School in China or a Shanghai branch of the World School. This matter is being planned and prepared.</p>
<p>World Comrades: The World School Comrades Association is an organization formed by people who sympathize with the World School. There are World School American Comrades and World School Chinese Comrades... The school buildings of the World School were funded by the American Comrades Association. The Chinese Comrades Association was founded last year and does not yet have this strength, but it is working in this direction and will surely be impressive in the future. Its first task is to introduce six Chinese students to the school. This minimum goal has now been achieved and exceeded. This association will, of course, have parents, teachers, and students as current and future members. In a broad sense, teachers and students include not only faculty and staff but also all advocates and sponsors. There is a separate report and charter for the detailed organization of the association, so what is said here can only be extremely brief.</p>
<p>First Luncheon: The above is a brief description, and the content includes World School teachers, students, student parents, relatives, and guests. This association is very friendly, simple, and hastily organized. One or two parents (namely Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Jingjiang) wanted to have a gathering and farewell with the teachers who led the students to go abroad. At the same time, other parents and organizers also had the same idea, so they integrated it as a whole to avoid repetition. Directly and indirectly, many relatives and friends also joined, and there was no long-term and meticulous organization. The host and guests have reached a hundred people. Three teachers and ten students are the main guests, and others are the hosts. There are also a few guests who happened to be there or were only invited by the host to accompany them. This luncheon seems to be held every time students go abroad in the future. This is not only the first luncheon but also the first chapter in the history of Chinese students at World Schools.</p>
<p>Teachers and Students Going to Europe: The first and second groups of Chinese teachers and students at World Schools are listed together because it is difficult to distinguish the first and second times. This is the first official organization. Although there were fewer people in the unofficial one, there was one last year. There was only one teacher and one student. The difference between formal and informal is a long story. In the past, the government did not allow children to go abroad except for those traveling with their parents. Starting this time, it has been officially permitted. Therefore, this is not only the first time that students from World Schools have officially gone abroad but also the first time that Chinese students have officially gone abroad, at least since the Republic of China. There are four teachers leading the students to go abroad:</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang teaches Chinese language and Sinology</p>
<p>Mr. Lian teaches temporary education</p>
<p>Mr. Pan represents the parents</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Hu teaches Chinese language and Sinology</p>
<p>Mr. Kang went abroad last year, and Mr. Pan, Mr. Xiang, and Mr. Xie are going abroad this time.</p>
<h3>High School and Above Students in This City: Military General Review Today: Held at Longhua Airport Starting at 9 AM: Director Pan, Mayor Wu, and Others Serve as the General Review Officers</h3>
<p>The National Military Training Committee of this city has set today and tomorrow to hold the annual general review of military training students from high schools and above in this city at Longhua Airport. Details are as follows:</p>

A temporary reviewing platform has been built at the west end of the field, with guest seats on both sides. A row of awnings has been specially erected on the left side of the field for the student soldiers to rest at noon. The committee has also installed a loudspeaker so that the review speeches can be heard clearly throughout the field.</p>

<p>The military parade and divisional parade will be held starting at 9 AM today. The general review officers will be Director Pan of the National Military Education Department of the Training Headquarters and Mayor Wu. The review officers will be Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau and Director He of the National Military Training Committee. The Municipal Public Security Bureau Military Band will arrive at the site to play music at that time.</p>

<p>A live ammunition shooting competition will be held at the Gaochang Temple West Battery shooting range starting at 8 AM tomorrow. The flag awarding ceremony and awards will be given at Longhua Airport at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. Each school will have three participants, and the shooting distance will be 150 meters.

<h3>Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau Talks about Children's Tuberculosis: 16 Million People in Our Country Suffer from Tuberculosis: Most Contracted During Childhood: Handle Injections, Examinations, and Recuperation, etc., Separately</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, spoke on the left about the past examinations and future relief of the many elementary school students in this city suffering from lung disease:</p>
<h3>Attention to Health Education</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, this city has attached great importance to children's health education. Since Mr. Gongzhan took office as the Director of the Education Bureau in the autumn of the year before last, he has made health education the central business of various education programs and has received the full cooperation of the Health Bureau. Therefore, the advancement of health education is fast.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Examination</h3>
<p>This spring, with the assistance of Dr. Gao Xianglang of the Chinese Red Cross Society, we began to handle tuberculosis examinations for elementary school students to prevent and treat tuberculosis. Hundreds of millions of people die from tuberculosis every year. According to accurate statistics, the world's tuberculosis death rate is 100,000 people as a unit. New Zealand's death rate is 51 people, Egypt's 72 people, the United States' 79 people, Germany's 89 people, the United Kingdom's 103 people, Spain's 136 people, Italy's 188 people, Japan's 186 people, and our country's death rate has reached 307 people. In total, 16 million people in our country suffer from this disease. On average, one in every 25 people suffers from this disease, and 80% of this disease is contracted during childhood.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Between Home and School</h3>
<p>Children do not realize that they have this disease at first and play as usual. If it is found at this time and treated early, they can be completely cured. Therefore, the Health Bureau and this bureau have specially requested pediatricians to first hold free tuberculosis injections and examinations at the Municipal Xicheng and Bide Elementary Schools. This injection is simpler than vaccination and has minimal reactions. There is no pain during the test. In advance, this bureau instructed the school to notify the family members and explain the reasons in detail. A parents' meeting was also held, and Dr. Gao gave a lecture to proceed.</p>
<h3>Many Patients</h3>
<p>Among the students examined, Xicheng had 397 people and Bide had 820 people. Xicheng had 262 people with positive reactions, and Bide had 542 people. The percentage of people suspected of infection accounted for 66%. However, the 66% of children with positive reactions may not all have tuberculosis, or may only be slightly infected and not yet sick. Therefore, the second step is to perform a detailed lung examination.</p>
<h3>Treatment Methods</h3>
<p>A lung examination with X-rays is available, but the price is quite expensive. The Red Cross only charges a material fee of three yuan. To serve the country, the treatment methods are based on the individual's condition and the current situation, and are handled in three different ways: (1) For the mildest cases, normal schooling will continue, but parents are requested to provide special nutrition and care, and to take cod liver oil for a long time (currently redesigned by Section Chief Wu Liguo of the Health Bureau to avoid the fishy taste). (2) For slightly ill individuals, reduce class and work hours, rest for two hours each in the morning, or study in the morning and rest in the afternoon, and add tonics. (3) For more serious cases, immediately seek medical treatment. Fortunately, very few cases are found to be severe after examination.</p>
<h3>Continuation of Testing</h3>
<p>It has recently been rumored that many students at Xicheng and Bide schools suffer from tuberculosis, and it is planned not to send children to school. In fact, this is not the case. If students from other schools are examined, there will also be similar alarming news. This is not only a problem for one school or one country; the whole world is suffering from the harm of tubercle bacilli. Next semester, this bureau and others will continue to invite Dr. Gao Jinglang and others to continue to carry out injections and tests for students from other schools.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Treatment</h3>
<p>In the future, regarding the relief of students with pulmonary tuberculosis and weak students, within the scope of economic possibilities, we should try to provide treatment in many ways, such as establishing a children's sanatorium in the municipal hospital, implementing sun lamp irradiation, sunbathing, open-air schools, and school meals in schools. This summer vacation, this bureau and others plan to jointly open summer nutrition classes in Gaoqiao, Wusong and other places with the Health Bureau, which is also for this reason. Since the government is working hard in the front, we deeply hope that the people will work hard in the rear. It is fortunate for the nation and fortunate for the country.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Issues Educational Subsidies for This Year The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Go and Collect Them Starting Today Huiqun and Other Three Schools Fail to Meet Requirements and Are Temporarily Suspended from Receiving Subsidies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau instructed 73 private schools, including the YMCA Middle School, stating: "In the case of the previous application by the school to allocate the 1934 educational subsidy from the Public Works Bureau of the First Special District, this bureau has sent personnel to investigate, carefully reviewed, and forwarded it to the Public Works Bureau for verification. Now, the reply from the Public Works Bureau is briefly translated as follows: 'After investigation, the schools listed in the table below can still meet the requirements of this bureau. This bureau has approved the issuance of the 1934 subsidy for each school. Please inform them to come to the bureau as usual from June 8 (Friday) to collect the first installment of the regular subsidy for this year. The approved construction subsidy this time and in previous years that has not been issued can be requested for use by the schools for construction needs or other purposes by the end of 1935. After the end of this year, except under special circumstances where schools need a small amount of construction subsidies for the construction of permanent school buildings, we will carefully consider it. This bureau will not use the funds for large expenditures, but this does not apply to the urgent need for sanitation improvements. Before approving the various subsidies for 1935, this bureau urgently wants to understand whether the subsidies issued this year are in accordance with the designated use. Please instruct each school to submit all purchase vouchers to this bureau for review, etc.' The regular subsidy and construction subsidy for this year have been approved." Therefore, it is ordered that you be informed of this order. Furthermore, the private Huiqun Girls' Primary and Secondary School and the Ningbo Native Association's Second Primary School were instructed: "In the case of the previous application by the school to allocate the 1934 educational subsidy from the Public Works Bureau of the First Special District, this bureau has sent personnel to investigate, carefully reviewed, and forwarded it to the Public Works Bureau for verification. Now, the reply from the Public Works Bureau is briefly translated as follows: 'Because the school failed to meet the requirements of this bureau, the 1934 subsidy is temporarily suspended from issuance, etc.'" Therefore, it is ordered that you be informed of this order.</p>

<p>(London Correspondence) This year's Wimbledon Tennis Championships will begin on June 25th. Strangely enough, a company has been established to gamble on this year's wins and losses, with the focus on guessing who will be the men's singles champion this year. This is the first time in the history of the Wimbledon Championships. The company has printed a list of players in alphabetical order and attached the number of payouts after guessing correctly. The numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>Pan Lai pays one to three, Crawford pays one to four</p>
<p>Austin pays one to four, Hills pays one to eight</p>
<p>Ailvsen pays one to eight, A Borogella pays twenty</p>
<p>Stokesfen pays one to twenty, McGrath pays one to twenty-five</p>
<p>The largest payout is one to two hundred, such as Silly, Mitsugi, Dorgate, Dinkin, Sharp, Orlev, and other unpopular players. The company's conditions are as follows: regardless of whether the player participates, the bet will not be refunded. For those who reach the quarter-finals, half of the payout will be paid. Wimbledon gambling has never been so prevalent. This gambling company is afraid of losing money. No one dares to try to pay one to five, let alone risk paying one to two hundred.</p>
<p>Newspapers are betting on Pan Lai to win, but according to the opinions of some experts, it belongs to Crawford. I would rather get one to four than Pan Lai's one to three.</p>
<p>Borogella's one to twenty is the most ridiculous, because Bao has already decided not to participate in the singles competition. McGrath's one to twenty-five is the most promising dark horse.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuzeng, Tang Baokun, and Liu Zhenyuan Said to Be Joining Guangdong's Southward Expedition</h3>
<p>The Guangzhou South China Sports Research Association will have a second trip to the South Seas</p>
<p>There is a saying about island competitions. The purpose of this trip is to raise funds for the association. In terms of sports, there will be basketball and volleyball. In addition, musicians and Cantonese opera performers will also travel together. Tang Baokun, Liu Zhenyuan, and Wang Yuzeng, the famous basketball players who attended the Far East Games, have also been temporarily invited to join the team.</p>
<h3>All of Shanghai Open Handball Singles Zhu Kuan Wins the Championship The Doubles Championship Was Also Won by Zhu Kuan and Hong Yukui A Glorious Page in the History of Chinese Sports</h3>
<p>The first All Shanghai Open Singles and Doubles Handball Championships initiated by the YMCA attracted many Western athletes. Among the Chinese who joined, the singles included Xia Zeren, Sun Daosheng (third place in this competition), and Zhu Kuan. The doubles only included Zhu Kuan and Hong Yukui. In addition to Zhu and Hong winning the doubles championship a few days ago, Mr. Zhu won the All Shanghai Singles Championship yesterday after two fierce battles with a score of 21 to 19 and 22 to 20, which is truly a glorious page in the history of Chinese sports. The intensity of the battle at that time was unprecedented. The details are described below.</p>
<p>Winners of the open handball, from right to left: Hong Yukui, Zhu Kuan (doubles champion and Zhu is the singles champion), Sun Daosheng (third in singles), Qian Yiqin (coach) (photographed by Qichang)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu won the first serve, but was immediately taken away by Chaka. Both sides strictly defended and attacked. After more than ten minutes, they only scored eight points each. Suddenly, Mr. Cha's spirits were lifted, and he scored many points in a row, creating an advantage of 18 to 12. At this time, Mr. Zhu was unwilling to show weakness and counterattacked vigorously, chasing to 20, and was regained by Mr. Cai for one point. However, Mr. Zhu saw the opportunity and immediately regained it, winning the last point with an unexpected victory, becoming 21 to 19, and winning the first game.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai served first. After fifteen rounds, both sides only scored three points each. Then, Mr. Zhu's kills were fierce, taking a lead of 10 to 6. Although Mr. Cai followed closely behind, he also scored several points, but he could not surpass Mr. Zhu. The recent score was 12 to 11, still led by Mr. Zhu. Then, both sides fought more and more fiercely. Mr. Cai once tied the score at 15, but Mr. Zhu gained four points, creating an advantage of 19 to 15. But soon</p>
<p>Mr. Cai tried his best to fight hard and chased to 18 points. At this time, both sides were exhausted. Mr. Zhu regained one point, becoming 20 to 18. However, Mr. Cai took the opportunity to regain two points, becoming a tie of 20 each. Fortunately, Mr. Zhu was quick-witted and scored two points, winning the final victory, and winning the singles championship in this competition.</p>
<p>On the whole, Mr. Zhu's ball skills are actually better than Mr. Cai's. However, Mr. Cai made many saves yesterday, and his left hand has made rapid progress after a week of practice. He is physically strong, but his wisdom is far inferior to Mr. Zhu's. The fact that both the singles and doubles championships were won by Chinese is due to the excellence of their ball skills, which made it possible to achieve this good result.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Tennis Association Will Hold a Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Tennis Association will hold its first meeting at the Shanghai Race Club on May Avenue at 5:30 pm today (8th). Committee members Fang Bofen, Zhou Jiaqi, Xu Demin, Ling Xitao, Chen Shao, Hu Qizhuo, Zhang Zizhen, and Secretary Lu Xiaoniao will all attend.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Women's Ball Game Zhijiang Basketball and Volleyball Teams Defeat the Art College</h3>
<p>Women's sports in Hangzhou has always been silent. Although the women's basketball team and volleyball team of Zhijiang Liberal Arts College were just established, they have achieved remarkable results. They have competed twice with the Art College team, which is famous in Hangzhou, and both have won great victories. It cannot be said that it is not a new star in the women's sports world in Hangzhou. The first basketball game was held on the afternoon of May 30th in Zhijiang. Zhijiang was at a disadvantage in the first quarter with a score of 6 to 0. In the second quarter, the new force Huang Jiaqing was transferred to the front, and Song Bin returned to guard the back, and the offense and defense became very active. In a few minutes, Huang Jiaqing scored three goals in a row. The third and fourth quarters were also entirely Zhijiang's strength. As a result, Zhijiang won a great victory with a score of 16 to 6.</p>
<p>The second volleyball game was held yesterday in the Art College. The strength of both sides was comparable. After the first game started, Zhijiang led the way, changing sides at 10 to 5. Although the Art College wanted to catch up, Zhijiang's soldiers worked hard, killing and saving, all reaching perfection. In the end, they won the first game with 21 to 12. After the second game started, the Art College took advantage of the serve and scored four points in a row. Zhijiang chased back one point, but the situation did not improve. They were at a disadvantage with a score of 18 to 3. The Art College was full of confidence that victory could be achieved. Who knew that the Zhijiang team was calm and responded to the battle. Yin Shuqing served first and added five points. Then the score became 20 to 16. Huang Jiaqing of Zhijiang got the opportunity to serve last. The situation suddenly became tense, and she scored six points in a row, and won the victory with 22 to 20. The victory or defeat of the third game was irrelevant. The Art College won back one game.</p>

<h3>The Yarn and Cotton Frenzy Has Not Subsided Yet Yarn and Cotton Fell Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yarn fell again yesterday, and the situation was extremely chaotic. Rising and falling suddenly made it difficult to grasp. Considering the price of cotton yesterday, the market was naturally high, but the spot yarn dealers were not feeling well, causing the sellers to be active, and the bulls and bears were indecisive. The daily transaction volume was too large, so once news came, the popularity changed drastically, and waves rose suddenly. The daily rise and fall range was very large, and the future is still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Falls Back One and a Half Yuan</h3>
<p>At the opening of the forward market for standard yarn, the bullish expectations that the price of US cotton would continue to rise were disappointed, causing the bulls to be disappointed. There were fewer buyers in the market, and the price fell. The prices for each month fell by two yuan, four, five, six, and eight angles. After the opening in the afternoon, it was heard that the price of three-grade yarn had risen, and the buying momentum was slightly stronger. After the second and third rounds of bidding, the price fell again, but it returned at the close. As a result, the price for each month fell by one or two angles. The total transaction volume for the day was 57,300 bales. It was found that Tongfu sold 1,050 bales, Hengyi 1,550 bales, Chunjun 1,000 bales, Dafeng 1,900 bales, Huikang 1,500 bales, Shenchang 1,600 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Taichang 2,100 bales, and Yichang 1,400 bales.

<h3>Yarn Sales Only 500+ Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still flat. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 555 bales for the day. In addition to the price falling by one yuan, the purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Anqing 15 Mainland 95 Ningbo 6</p>
<p>Guangdong 380 Fellow Traders 55 Nanjing 5</p>
<p>The cotton market changed suddenly. The daily decline was particularly strong. It was reported that a large number of bullish companies released more than 40,000 dans, causing the market to loosen. The floating bulls also settled their positions, and the decline became more and more fierce. It was also reported that the bullish companies absorbed a huge amount of more than 200,000 dans. The future changes are difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao's Bulls Dump Heavily</h3>
<p>Before the market opened, Biao Hua predicted that American cotton would rise sharply. The previous day's surge was too rapid, and a reaction was expected. Due to a lack of buyers in the market, prices fell across the board. Shenchang, representing the bull company Wang, dumped a large amount of stock, with the current month falling by 0.05 yuan, and the distant months falling by 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 jiao. In the afternoon, each month fell by another 0.1 or 0.2 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 185,300 dan.

<h3>High Asking Prices Stall Factory Demand</h3>
<p>Sales of spot cotton are relatively sluggish due to high asking prices, which are discouraging factories. The supply included 216 bales of Tong Cotton.</p>
<p>5.00 bales of Shaanxi cotton were delivered to the Rihua Factory. 200 pieces of spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>English and Indian Cotton Rise, American Cotton Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American spot cotton market was firm, resulting in unchanged spot prices. Futures rose by 1 to 4 points. English cotton futures rose by 13 points. Indian cotton was firm due to buying by speculators, Japanese traders, and futures traders. As a result, Pingguoer rose by 4 rupees 7.5 jiao, Aomula rose by 5 rupees 7.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi rose by 6 rupees. The original telegram follows: (Dated the 6th)</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Battle Lines Between Bulls and Bears in Yarn: Changfeng Sold the Most at 16,050 Bales; Hengyi Bought the Most at 2,250 Bales</h3>
<p>The open interest of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange for yarn futures, as of June 6th, was 53,100 bales for the June contract, 49,450 bales for the October contract, and 30,550 bales for the November contract, totaling 310,550 bales. The yarn market has been fluctuating greatly recently, and the volume of trading by both bulls and bears is enormous, resulting in an extremely volatile situation. Both buyers and sellers are unsettled. The following is a summary of the largest buyers and sellers:</p>
<p>| Sellers     | Buyers     |</p>
<p>| ----------- | ----------- |</p>
<p>| No. 5 Maoji 6,500       | No. 10 Hengyi 12,256       |</p>

<h3>The Securities and Bond Market Continues to Climb, But Momentum Seems to Be Weakening After Consecutive Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market continued to struggle upwards, but the momentum seemed to be weakening. This was due to the fact that sellers gradually emerged after several days of consecutive rises. After a brief easing of money, it rose again, reaching a new high of 71.4 yuan. The entire June contract reached a high of 64.8 yuan, which is a new high since 128. The situation does not yet show any significant weaknesses. In the final session, the June contract suddenly saw an abnormal attitude of being higher in the near term than in the far term. This was because short selling in the far term was temporarily overenthusiastic and cannot be used to determine the overall situation. It may cause a slight reversal or a temporary stabilization. The future may not necessarily stop at this price. Yesterday, at the opening in the morning, the front-month contracts rose slightly by 0.1 or 0.15 jiao. Jin Duan and the entire June contract fell back slightly by 0.3 or 0.4 jiao due to some selling by Nos. 4, 16, and 90, but the small pullback after the big rise failed to shake the psychology of the bulls. Next, the front-month contracts still showed signs of excess supply, falling back by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao. Afterwards, Nos. 21, 31, and 534 all had demand, allowing Jin Duan to stabilize, and the entire June contract regained 0.1 jiao, and sentiment turned bullish again. At the opening in the afternoon, there was a unanimous rise, and Jin Duan and the entire June contract jumped about 0.4 jiao. All the losses from the two morning sessions were recovered. The closing trend remained firm, and Jin Duan and the entire June contract rose again by about 0.3 jiao, reaching new highs again. However, the sellers were more active in the distant-month entire June contract, and the market price went from high to low, showing an abnormality of being 0.05 yuan lower than the current month's price, which is inconsistent with the norm. Based on this point, there should be a reversal. Overall, the market price still rose unanimously, with Jin Duan and the entire June contract up 0.4 to 0.65 jiao, and the rest up 0.2 or 0.3 jiao. The total transaction volume was 16.7 million yuan. The following is a list of the increases and decreases:</p>
<p>| Contract                                  | Highest | Lowest | Change from Previous | Volume         |</p>

<h3>Grain: Futures Prices for Flour are Flat, Distant Months are Low</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a phenomenon of initially falling and then improving. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell back to about 0.5 or 0.6 jiao, and Canada fell about 0.2 jiao, so after the initial opening, sentiment immediately became unstable, and the bid price for each month fell by about 0 fen from the previous day. Then, because the current month had floating shorts hedging, and the distant month had outside bulls also receiving, the opening price gradually improved again. However, the out-of-town merchants ultimately did not pay attention because of the very good wheat harvest and the little improvement in sales. Until the afternoon opening, the nearby months rose slightly because the factories did not sell. The market atmosphere was as usual. Although the distant months were still absorbed by outsiders, the industry people were not moved by the good domestic wheat production, so after a slight improvement, they softened again.

<h3>The Exhausted and Weak Futures Wheat</h3>

With the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell back by 0.5 to 0.6 jiao, and Canada fell by about 0.1 jiao, so after the opening, outside sentiment had turned to wait and see. As for the industry people, the out-of-town merchants on the Jinpu Railway have been selling off continuously due to the good harvest, and their thoughts are also very firm, so although the decline is not much, the market atmosphere has been exhausted and stagnant. As a result, July was shorted 0.1 fen, August was shorted 0.19 fen, and September and October were each shorted 0.3 fen. As for the new wheat situation, samples have arrived in Shanghai from the Yangtze River area. According to communications from the Wuhu merchants, the harvest is exceptionally abundant in Jiangbei, such as Luzhou Prefecture, and the harvest is also better in Jiangnan. Currently, the market value of the new scale is about 2.67 yuan, and new goods are still expected to fall.

<h3>Late and Substandard Rice Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from about 30 merchants, (about 5,000 shi of goods) with thick and thin japonica rice each accounting for about half. The sales of late rice were initially slack. Sellers with old goods were inevitably a little discouraged and planned to cut prices and sell quickly. The market shape therefore went downstream. However, after this decline, the Beiyang sales market suddenly became active, so the later market seemed tighter. Fresh ones could stand slightly firm. The closing statistics showed that a total of 2,450 bags of Qingjiao Song, Sixi Lianfengjing and other goods were sold, with both fresh and old ones. The market situation was that the old and substandard ones continued to fall by 0.1 or 0.2 jiao, while the fresh ones fell by only a small number of fen. At the same time, about 500 bags of Sutong thick japonica rice were also sold in Beiyang, so the goods from the Chang merchants, Nangang and Sutong merchants and other merchants were slightly fixed after the early market sales at the stores. The Du Yang sharp rice was weak at 0.05 yuan because of the weak arrivals and sales. The Yinyuan rice continued to fall in price due to limited sales. However, the quality was very different, and the leveling or fixing varied from 0.1 to 0.2 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 289 boats arrived in Hexia. The sales of various goods on the market were still slack. In addition to the 0.2 jiao price drop for Baiyuan, the high-quality Baijing was flat, the medium and inferior ones were weak by nearly a jiao, and the Yangjian thin rice was weak by a small number of fen. There were few Du</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Broad Beans Decline Further by Half a Corner</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new broad beans from Wenzhou were again sold at a lower price; other varieties remained stable. A total of over seven hundred bags of green broad beans arrived, mostly of near top quality. Therefore, exports increased; it is estimated that Guangbang merchants purchased over one hundred bags, while the rest were procured by Shantou merchants. The market price was uniformly four yuan and ten cents. Ningbo white broad beans were still traded at the original price, with over one hundred eighty bags purchased by Tianjin merchants. Wenzhou white broad beans, being duty-free goods, were intentionally sold cheaply by the dealers, so the price continued to fall by half a corner. Over one hundred bags were traded at a price of three yuan and seventy-five cents, also purchased by Tianjin merchants. Rapeseed from various regions has arrived, but due to high prices at the origin, the owners are temporarily selling at a loss. Yesterday, only two hundred bags of Wenzhou goods were offered, priced at three taels and thirty-nine qian and a half. According to foreign firm regulations, there were also over three hundred bags of Nanjing goods remaining from the previous night, priced at three yuan and seventy-eight cents, a further slight decrease in price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Robust Trading in Luzhuang Zhenmei Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the foreign tea market in this port, interest in Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi, Sui'an, Wenzhou, and other regions, handled by Yingzhuang Jinlong, Yihe Xiehe, Tianxiang Huacha, and Tianyu firms, was keen. The total volume of green tea traded in the city reached over two thousand boxes, with sales prices unchanged from before. Eight thousand more boxes of Keemun black tea arrived from the Yangtze River yesterday, but trading was not active. Coarse black tea from Luzhuang, such as those from Hubei and Wenzhou, remained popular. It is said that tea-producing areas in Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and Hubei, which traditionally manufactured and sold green tea, have completely switched to manufacturing black tea to meet the needs of foreign firms.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Jiangxi Tea Arrives in Shanghai丨Over Sixteen Thousand Boxes Arrived in the Last Two Days丨</h3>
<p>This year's new tea has already appeared on the market, with sales in this port consisting of tea from Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, transported by rail. Jiangxi is also a tea-producing region, with most of its tea being sold to Russia. It is reported that this year's harvest is quite good, but land transportation is inconvenient, relying entirely on shipping. Starting last week, over a thousand boxes have been arriving successively, with recent arrivals becoming more frequent. The Ruihe ship brought over seventy boxes the day before yesterday, and the Taikoo Wuhu ship brought another nine thousand seven hundred boxes yesterday, with a large batch still waiting to be loaded and transported to Shanghai. As for sales to foreign firms, activity is gradually increasing, with several batches already shipped out.</p>
<h3>Suzhou and Zhejiang Silkworm Cocoons Are Scarce</h3>
<p>The Pingyao cocoon market is gradually closing. New cocoons have been on the market in the Pingyao area of Yuyao for over ten days. Cocoon merchants are offering low prices, with the highest price for improved varieties being only twenty yuan, and the lowest price for native varieties being fourteen yuan and fifty cents. Farmers are all selling at a loss. The amount of goods arriving on the market is decreasing, and cocoon merchants are gradually closing their scales.</p>
<p>The best improved variety of cocoons is from Lin'an. The model sericulture area of Lin'an has had a bountiful harvest of improved silkworm breeds. The quality of the cocoons is also better, while native varieties are slightly inferior. Cocoon merchants have been weighing and purchasing cocoons for over ten days, and the amount of goods arriving on the market is still high. The price of improved varieties is thirty yuan, while native varieties are seventeen or eighteen yuan, causing farmers to suffer losses.</p>
<p>Most silkworm farmers in Liyang are losing money. Farmers in the four rural areas of Liyang raised a good number of silkworms this year, but there was a shortage of leaves, and leaf prices were not stable, resulting in high costs. Cocoon merchants are weighing and purchasing cocoons according to the prices agreed upon by the industry association, with improved varieties selling for fifteen to thirty yuan per sima catty and native varieties selling for fourteen to eighteen yuan. As a result, most silkworm farmers are losing money. The opening price for new cocoons in Haimen is not high. Cocoon merchants in the various sandbar areas of Haimen have been opening their scales for three or four days. The weather this year has been unfavorable, and farmers have suffered significant losses of native silkworms. The production of improved cocoons is still abundant, but cocoon prices are not high, with improved varieties selling for twenty to twenty-five yuan and native varieties selling for fourteen to eighteen yuan. Silkworm farmers are selling with reluctance.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Production Volume. This year, Zhejiang province distributed 600,000 sheets of improved breeds in each sericulture area. Each sheet of silkworms produced a maximum of 50 catties of cocoons, and a minimum of 20 catties. Overall there were 18,000,000 dan of fresh cocoons produced for a very plentiful harvest. The cocoons are also said to be high quality.</p>
<p>Overseas silk sales are becoming increasingly sluggish. Due to slow sales of silk fabrics, overseas silk weaving factories are trying to reduce production, and raw silk mills are becoming less active. Japanese silk is still being sold aggressively, and silk prices in New York and Lyon have fallen to their lowest levels. There is no news about Chinese silk. European and American firms in Shanghai are considering lowering prices and stockpiling goods, making it difficult for Chinese merchants to sell at a loss. The market atmosphere is increasingly sluggish, with no transactions reported.</p>
<h3>Five Metals: New Lead Wire Sees Mixed Fortunes</h3>
<p>Trading in new lead wire shows mixed fortunes due to the type of wire involved. Types such as numbers 12, 14, and 16 to 20 have recently seen business from Fuzhou, the Yangtze River, and inland river merchants. Coarser types such as numbers 6 to 10 and 23 to 25 have seen sluggish market activity due to their rare sales. Recently, the supply of goods from Japan has been very strong, so there is a large amount of stock on the market. Goods from Britain and America have been affected and there is no trading. Eastern goods are cheap and sell quickly, while British and American goods are expensive, so transactions are minimal. The market prices are listed below for comparison:</p>

<p>A child crawling on the ground and an old man using a cane are not much different. Pure, innocent. If we say that human nature is not empty, and that there are two natures, divine and human, then divinity can be said to be most pronounced in these two periods. The god-like form and the transcendent, primitive soul.</p>
<p>Children of all races, black and yellow, are indistinguishable when they are together, because their blood is all crimson red. Old people of all races, black and yellow, are also indistinguishable when they are together, because their hair is all white. Only in the middle of life are there differences in nation and race; there are politics and diplomatic games. And their blood is green or black.</p>
<p>Confucius's three cautions—against lust, against strife, and against greed—can be said to understand human nature. They refer to these busy people. They also implicitly agree with the Buddhist cautions against delusion, hatred, and greed, although the latter are broader. The vague teachings of philosophers seem no more foolish than those of clever people, but rather a little cleverer, so they say such things. Those with four feet and those with three feet are not included. Only in the age of two feet, after satisfying food and lust, is it most frightening.</p>
<p>If divinity is submerged and the soul is destroyed, then what remains is the purely materialistic middle-aged person, who is most pitiful. At this time, like a drowning person, one frantically tries to grasp something, seeking to survive in the crowd or to transcend the crowd, forcefully clinging to everything. There is often a hidden terror, thinking, "Once I die, will there be nothing left?" Thus, one strives to cling, allowing human nature to develop to the extreme, belonging to nothing, and creating all kinds of sins.</p>
<p>And time is mercilessly passing, unknowingly deteriorating with fortune. If one slightly reflects, one realizes that all that is clung to is illusory, truly "everything is empty." Recalling one's life, regret arises everywhere, still frantic. If divinity is restored at this time, and one is subjected to invisible whipping, then it can be said to be human hell!</p>
<p>Those who understand the morning and evening of life, if they slightly examine themselves, will slightly change their actions! The world will also undergo some changes.</p>
<h3>Another Proposal丨Regarding the Reprinting of Ancient Books丨</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Yuan's "Proposal to Those Reprinting Ancient Books" in the "Literature" "Special Issue on Chinese Literature Research," I would like to share some ideas that I have long held in my heart.</p>
<p>My opinion is this: For ancient books that have lasting value and are needed by most people, such as the "Twenty-Four Histories," they should be reprinted with inferior paper and smaller fonts, so that they can be sold at the lowest possible price and widely circulated.</p>
<p>Book scholars or collectors with money probably would not understand the benefits of the above-mentioned method of printing ancient books, but most readers will surely understand. For example, an ordinary stone-printed copy of "Water Margin" costs at least one yuan, but there is a kind of inferior copy on the market that only costs two or three jiao. Why is it so cheap? Naturally, it is because the paper is inferior, the printing is poor, and, because it is a reprint of an ancient book, manuscript fees and royalties are also saved, so the cost is indeed low. Perhaps there are other reasons that make the cost even lower than the above, but these are unknown to an outsider like myself who is not in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>Because it is cheap, many people buy it. Whether in the city or in the countryside, these kinds of books are extremely popular. On the bookshelves of college students who do not like to buy books, next to the dressing tables of modern young ladies who do not know what books are, and together with textbooks, one can often find several kinds of inferior copies of "Wenxin Diaolong," "Su Huang's Letters," "Shishuo Xinyu," and "Peony Pavilion." Because they are merely decorations, these kinds of books are also bound in Western style, making them look good. As for the counters of small shop clerks and the pillows of rural teachers, these kinds of "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "Anthology of Ancient Prose" have almost completely replaced the previous stone-printed copies, because these kinds are letterpress printed and have modern punctuation marks, making them look much more refreshing than the stone-printed copies, and the price is cheaper than the stone-printed copies.</p>
<p>These kinds of printed books are worthy of promotion; only they can circulate widely and become popular among readers. However, unfortunately, the publishing houses that are currently printing these kinds of books are only reprinting ordinary novels and notes, which can only be used by general low-level readers for entertainment. Large-scale, valuable books are not being printed. Therefore, this matter cannot yet be said to have made any good contributions to the cultural world, and because it always caters to low-level tastes and publishes boring novels, it will instead poison the majority of readers.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a proposal for these publishing houses: use the same method to systematically and planfully reprint large-scale, valuable ancient masterpieces. In my opinion, if the "Twenty-Four Histories" were also reprinted in this way, then readers could buy them for only a few dollars, and as a result, many people would definitely buy them, and the reprinting houses could still make money. If they could do this, then their contribution to the cultural world would be far greater than that of other houses that are photolithographically printing "Rare Books from the Siku Quanshu" and finely printing "Sibu Beiyao." Even the "Basic Collection of National Studies" that Mr. Yuan praised is still printed too well and sold too expensively for most readers.</p>
<p>Of course, errors are inevitable in this kind of edition, because the manufacturing is close to being crude. But for the average reader, encountering a few errors is really not a big deal. There are many books that, rather than not being able to read at all, it is better to read with errors. Reading will always be more beneficial than not reading. Moreover, are there not also many errors in those books that are photolithographically printed in Song Dynasty fonts?</p>
<h3>Visiting Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>— Zijin</p>
<p>On a rare, drizzly afternoon in Beijing, five of us, newcomers from the South, were guided by Mr. He, a long-time resident of the ancient capital, to visit Tianqiao, Beijing's entertainment district for the poor.</p>
<p>We spent a few copper coins to listen to the raspy-voiced girls sing drum lyrics, watched boxing matches and medicine peddlers, monkey shows, and the strange things at various stalls. As we walked to the entrance of a narrow, dirty alley, Mr. He pointed and said, "Sai Jinhua lives in there." His casual remark aroused our curiosity. We pleaded, "Take us to see her!"</p>
<p>We walked into this narrow alley lined with low houses and stood outside a pair of dilapidated gates. We saw a paper strip pasted on the gate with the four large characters "Jiangxi Wei Residence." We knocked on the door, and a woman in her fifties came out to open it. She seemed to know Mr. He, and without asking, she let us in. After passing through a narrow, cluttered courtyard, Sai Jinhua's bedroom was on the left. We walked into that dark, small room full of broken objects. The room really couldn't hold all six of us, so those who came later had to stand by the threshold.</p>
<p>The arrival of this group of strangers clearly disturbed everyone in the room. As soon as we entered, a man in his forties walked out from the inner room, followed by a woman dressed in simple black clothing. According to Mr. He's introduction, she was Sai Jinhua. She greeted Mr. He peacefully. After clarifying our intentions, she immediately said, "My place is very simple, please don't laugh! Please sit, please sit!"</p>
<p>Everything in the room, all the furnishings, seemed to be symbols of Sai Jinhua's difficult, miserable, and melancholic life in her later years.</p>
<p>This beauty from Suzhou, whose enchanting name once stirred up a sensation, captivated countless men of letters, refined scholars, heroes, and magnates, and who "once sat with the British Emperor for a photograph, a remarkable event in contemporary opinion," was now only wearing a tattered black cotton-padded jacket and pants, with yellowish cotton peeking out from the holes. The glory and wealth of her past seemed to have completely escaped from her, leaving her with only poverty, disease, and suffering.</p>
<p>"How old are you this year, madam?" Mr. O asked.</p>
<p>"Just sixty years old. I'm old, useless, often sick, and very poor!"</p>
<p>Her plaintive answer couldn't help but surprise us. In her fair skin, lively demeanor, and clear voice, we could only see a middle-aged woman of about forty at most. She didn't look old or frail at all. No matter what, we couldn't believe she was already an old woman of sixty. However, her face was palely pitiable. This was probably because, as she said, poverty led to malnutrition, and sickness often accompanied her.</p>
<p>"How do you make a living now?" Mr. B asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>"I'm completely destitute. I don't know about tomorrow. For the past year or two, I've been relying on my mother's remaining clothes and jewelry to exchange for money. I really don't know how I'll live after that..." Her eyes, which were once captivating in her youth, were now filled with tears.</p>
<p>"What are your plans for the future?" Mr. B asked with sympathy.</p>
<p>"I have no way at all. What plans can a sixty-year-old woman have?... But I want to go back to the South. I still have my sister-in-law, nephews, and nieces in Suzhou. I want to go back and see them. Jiangnan must be full of birdsong and flowers now, right? Some gentlemen from the South, tell me about the scenery of Jiangnan!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"I have a wish now: I want to return to Jiangnan and find a piece of land in Hangzhou for a burial plot. As the saying goes, 'Live in Suzhou, die in Hangzhou.' I only have this little wish now. But this is obviously just a dream..." she said with unspeakable sadness.</p>
<p>"That's easy to do!" Ms. A consoled her.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"I also want to become a vegetarian and practice religion," she said, as if calming down.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Madam, please serve tea to the guests," the woman in her fifties who led us in brought in tea and snacks. Sai Jinhua glanced at her, turned her head, and told us, "This is a loyal servant! She has served me since I was young, all the way until now. I don't have the money to hire her now, but she is willing to suffer with me!"</p>
<p>The eyes of all six of us turned to this maidservant. She had a face of loyalty, endurance, courage, and a strong body.</p>
<p>We had tea, took a photo of Sai Jinhua, and then said goodbye.</p>
<p>As we walked out of the gate, everyone recited the same two lines of poetry:</p>
<p>"Desolate and deserted before the gate, few carriages and horses come; in old age, she married a merchant!"</p>
<p>(May 12, 1934)</p>
<h3>Frog Song</h3>
<p>— Wang Yixin</p>
<p>The song of the frogs is like a downpour</p>
<p>Sprinkling on the lonely fields;</p>
<p>A sense of nervous energy</p>
<p>Painted on this quiet village night.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>It follows you, right and left,</p>
<p>Like stars filling the sky;</p>
<p>A bustling night music</p>
<p>Plays out the daytime tension of farm work.</p>
<h3>Spring by the Side of Solitary Beauty Peak</h3>
<p>— Yingbing</p>
<p>The sun is shining and people are already feeling a little hot, and the wind doesn't blow as coldly as before. This is spring!</p>
<p>The spring in Jiangnan is considered to be very enviable weather, but the spring in the South is even better, especially making me constantly think of the spring by the side of Solitary Beauty Peak.</p>
<p>"Guilin's scenery is the best in the world," this is a sentence everyone knows. In fact, when it comes to our Guangxi, there are mountains and water everywhere, with very beautiful natural scenery.</p>
<p>As soon as you enter Guangxi's gate—Wuzhou, whether you go to Liuzhou by the Liu River or to Guilin by the Fu River, you will see "mountains and water" along the way. The water seems to flow in the gaps between the mountains, and the mountains are continuous and stretch out: there are dense forests on the mountains, villages at the foot of the mountains, vegetable plots by the river, and willow trees... There are fishing boats by the river. When spring arrives, everything you see is a refreshing scene. The boat travels between the mountains, and you often encounter the feeling of "having exhausted the mountains and rivers and suspecting there is no road," but when you turn a corner, it suddenly becomes clear.</p>
<p>If you arrive in Guilin, the scenery is certainly quite beautiful, worthy of others' praise, among which the most outstanding is Solitary Beauty Peak.</p>
<p>Solitary Beauty Peak is in the center of the city, behind the Jingjiang Prince's Mansion of the Ming Dynasty. Now a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Pagoda has been built next to Solitary Beauty Peak, surrounding Solitary Beauty Peak to form a Sun Yat-sen Park. Solitary Beauty Peak is as straight as a pen, large at the bottom and small at the top, and even smaller at the top point. There are several small temples, which look like a pen tip from a distance. It is not high, with 365 steps. There is a pond at the foot of the peak—Crescent Moon Pond. In spring, the water rises, and you can go boating inside. There is a pavilion in the pond, connected to the two banks by a winding bridge.</p>
<p>In the past, we studied at the school next to Solitary Beauty Peak, and Sun Yat-sen Park was our campus. In spring, there are especially many tourists, and the scenery is especially beautiful. The flowers and grass seem to be taller for the happy tourists. Ping, Hua, and Fen and I have all been happy tourists in the happy spring. What about now? Ping, Hua, and Fen, I haven't known their news for a long time.</p>
<p>Beautiful spring by the side of Solitary Beauty Peak, I think you will not lose color without us. Now spring has come again, and some spring feelings and spring meanings cannot help but make me think of the precious time of the past spring by the side of Solitary Beauty Peak.</p>

<h3>Fire Disaster (4)</h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>I then received many old friends. They all seemed a little older, and everyone had lost that old lively and cheerful color, as if they had gone through a disaster, and everyone had changed into another person. It was the same with my old classmate Zhang Wentian—the boss of Fuhe Company—who used to be a lively child. Ten years ago, we had ridden bicycles and raced on forest paths, and we had also rowed Malay boats and raced in tidal rivers. Now he was much more mature, showing that he was an adult carrying a heavy burden, and his face was even that of a merchant planning and strategizing.</p>
<p>He invited me to a banquet held at their store at 10:30 in the evening, organized by a group of young people to welcome me.</p>
<p>At dinner time, I talked with my uncle about the recent situation of relatives, the situation in Tangshan, and some news from Southeast Asia. I drank a little wine with the old man, and then walked out of here and ran to Fuhe Company in the third room on the left. I heard that my uncle's affairs had not been completed, and it was not convenient for me to bother him. Moreover, it was more free to talk there, and the actions could be more unrestrained.</p>
<p>The scene in Fuhe Company's store was almost as lonely, but the goods were piled up even more than in my relative's store. Because it was night, the dim light reflected on the cold glass showcases, and the scene felt even more desolate. When Mr. Zhang saw me coming, he greeted me enthusiastically and invited me to drink a cup or two of Chaozhou "Kung Fu Tea." Although I don't drink much tea now, I had tasted the taste and poetry of this antique tea ten years ago. Now, drinking this very strong tea, although a bit bitter, the enthusiasm of old friends is sweet, so I had to drink some.</p>
<p>Because it was early, he accompanied me to stroll through the several streets in this small village market. Although there were scattered shops and houses on these streets, they could not block the coconut groves and betel nut trees that were exposed on both sides of the road. In the quieter streets, "Atap Houses" still vaguely flashed, and the original flavor of this village was well preserved. In the past, we often spent good evenings here, when the sun went down and the evening coolness arrived. I had been thinking that I probably would not be able to appreciate this beautiful scenery again, but who knew that I would taste this meaning again now?</p>

<h3>Reason</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>It is said that northerners value reason the most. If you give him a scolding or a few slaps, he will first ask you if you are being reasonable. If you can clearly state the great reason why you are treating him this way, then he will silently endure it and admit his bad luck. Otherwise, he will risk his entire life to fight with you to the death, no matter the cost.</p>
<p>Originally, a person who disregards everything for the sake of respecting reason is worthy of admiration and praise. But this also sufficiently reveals his foolishness and stupidity, because he simply does not understand that reason is originally a slippery thing.</p>
<p>The story of a person who secretly rides the ruler's chariot because his mother is sick, and offers the remaining peaches to the ruler to win the ruler's praise, but is killed as a result, is known to everyone. Up until now, the changes in events have become even more bizarre: clearly killing and arson is called maintaining world peace; clearly seizing and occupying by force is called good neighborliness. For many years, every time a major or minor incident has occurred, has it not been based on a great reason? Pitifully, a group of people who adhere to reason have silently and quietly endured humiliation and injustice under this.</p>
<p>The level of civilization of a country is often measured by the degree to which the people of that country abide by reason. Because everyone is reasonable, then barbarism is completely shed, and there are no cases of the strong oppressing the weak or the many bullying the few, and the world is at peace. Our country has thousands of years of history, and our people have undergone such a long period of tempering and edification, so the degree to which they adhere to reason will naturally be higher than that of others. But, unfortunately, it is precisely because our country is the most reasonable country, speaking reason to the extreme and making everything logical, so there are still inevitably those who suffer losses and injustices without realizing it. Not being reasonable at all is certainly not good, but completely believing in reason is also very dangerous!</p>
<h3>International Labour Conference</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, on the shores of Lake Geneva in Geneva, the League of Nations Administrative Council, Advisory Committee, Disarmament and other conferences have been bustling, and the world's politicians, diplomats, and experts have been constantly gathering in the "Palace of Peace." Like a continuous stream of carriages on Shanyin Road, it was quite a grand scene for a time. While these events are still "echoing" in our minds, the International Labour Conference, attended by representatives from forty-six countries, has opened with great ceremony amidst the reflections of the lake. This place has always been filled and occupied by important figures on the world political stage. Everyone knows that it is for "upholding justice and striving for peace," which goes without saying. Now, the so-called "worker representatives" from various countries are competing with each other and gathering here to discuss matters, which naturally deserves our attention. The development of the labor movement, especially the manifestation of international solidarity among the working class, is enough to make those from the increasingly declining classes gasp in astonishment when mentioned even briefly, because the progress of this situation will inevitably raise the issue of the actual improvement of the lives of the working masses themselves, as well as the issue of changing the existing social system that is incompatible with improving their own lives. However, the proposal and advancement of these events must be met head-on by those in various countries who are concerned about social order. However, the League of Nations "Labour" Conference can hold its eighteenth regular meeting in a grand manner on the banks of the Geneva River, which is its unique feature and cannot be regarded as just another labor conference.</p>
<p>In the current situation of deepening economic panic and increasingly urgent war crises, on the one hand, laborers are suffering from wage cuts, increased working hours, starvation, and unemployment; on the other hand, they are painfully aware of losing their freedom to survive and being forced to be "cannon fodder." If this statement is true, and it is generally recognized, then the thorough resolution of these events is the current task of laborers and the "workers' interests" that must be strived for unanimously. In that case, how will these representatives of the International Labour Conference discuss and debate in the "Palace of Peace" to seek the well-being of the workers on these issues?</p>
<p>According to a Geneva dispatch: "Matters related to the interests of world laborers will be brought up for discussion: ··· The main agenda item is the plan to alleviate world unemployment: ··· and promote large-scale public works to reduce unemployment. Supporters of the forty-hour work week will urge the final reading of the forty-hour work week draft. The conference will also submit the draft of unemployment insurance and other assistance to unemployed workers for final reading," and so on. In these agendas, it can be seen that the representatives of the conference also believe that unemployment is a serious situation in the world at the moment, making many rulers of the current society dizzy, but they are limited by the aura of their own "colored glasses," intentionally or unable to see through this situation, revealing the problem of the social organization that causes unemployment. Therefore, the International Labour Conference can only treat the symptom but not the cause, and without any actual implementation, read out the draft of unemployment insurance and other assistance to unemployed workers again and again. As for the forty-hour work week, although "labor experts" say that it does not conflict with the new industry regulations in the United States, with the opposition of the United Kingdom, "it is not believed that it can pass the meeting," which is even more of a case of "discussion without a decision."</p>
<p>The essence of this "main agenda" of the International Labour Conference is such, so even if the conference re-elects the "Committee to Protect the Interests of Workers," even if it is believed that it will "pass the meeting," it is not seen that it can truly "protect the interests of workers." As for the "highly instructive" effect on Germany, which will be used to apply for "public works" to be built in various countries, regardless of anything else, we know that Hitler's war preparations have been very enthusiastic recently, and the military industry is extremely developed. The United States, Britain, France, Japan, and others are also doing the same. Is this the "public works" of the International Labour Conference to alleviate unemployment? Its solution to unemployment!</p>
<p>The International Labour Conference is convened by the Labour Bureau of the League of Nations. Among its twenty-four elected administrative personnel, twelve are government representatives from various countries, six are worker representatives, and six are employer representatives. This is why the International Labour Conference is the International Labour Conference.</p>
<h3>Words from the Model Society</h3>
<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>From your letter, I can roughly see a self-portrait of your distress; from education, from knowledge, from scholars' books, from professors' dictation, you have established an ideal future that is perfect in every way; and you have taken this ideal, if you keep it locked in a house, keep it immersed in the embrace of others, keep it buried in the outline of general theories, then there will be no problem. Now you have bumped into reality, bumped into it until your skin is broken and your bones are cracked, which was originally an expected thing and is not surprising. When iron is thrown into a furnace to be forged, it may not be a pleasant thing for the iron itself; moreover, the lesson you have learned is only the first chapter of the introduction arranged for you by the teacher of reality?</p>
<p>You say that you feel that everything in this world is a bit wrong, and everything is a bit unsatisfactory; and when it comes to this "not quite right" and "unsatisfactory," you can't find the source of its disease, and the treatment is of course out of the question. "Discovering the unsatisfactory and having to live in this helpless unsatisfactory is the 'most painful thing'." As you said; however, knowing the reason, knowing the solution, if you lack the power to act, it will also make you annoyed, have you ever thought about this? You asked me about the reason for your烦闷 and the solution, but I can't tell you anything. Regarding this, you should ask American-style Chinese professors who are good at compiling lecture outlines, or youth guidance experts, they will definitely recite 1234 and ABCD fluently to you item by item, although whether the reason is right or not, whether the method is useful or not is a question, but they are still a guide; and my age is almost the same as yours, I am still groping in the dark, and I can't find a concrete way to relieve my distress: and sometimes, I can't help but be as depressed as you are. For your "seeking a panacea" style of desire, can I bear to give you incense ash and rotten candle oil that I don't know to make a elixir?</p>
<p>However, precisely because I am also patiently drinking the bitter wine of youth like you, and I am treading on dangerous waves; and now, I have been thrown into the white-hot fire; and we often talk together, talking about everything. I think the person who knows a person best is no one else but himself, then my observation and understanding of you, or can be said to be ourselves knowing ourselves?</p>
<p>I can't say anything else to you, but there is one phenomenon that makes me deeply puzzled, that is: you worship fate too much, and you believe in opportunity too much: therefore, you have doubts and distrust about yourself. However, opportunity and fate often pull people away from reality, and what you see and experience are all the ugliest aspects of reality, and your ideals and body are growing contradictorily in you.</p>
<p>Is this the source of our tragedy?</p>
<p>In me, from hunger, from the daily planning for survival, from the battle of the masses for life, I have learned a new lesson, deeply believing that people are not easily despised animals; only in this way, I am not willing to despise myself.</p>
<p>Believing in yourself does not necessarily mean doubting others, I suppose there is no need to say more about this?</p>
<p>However, in this era, people like you may be tolerated by the general society, because they are asking people to abandon reality to pursue opportunity, to pursue fate. Is the "Hamlet" type of youth who is hesitant and accomplishes nothing not considered to be well-behaved? There are many people in this era who are enticing people with opportunities. If you can't believe in yourself and still indulge in opportunity and fate, then I advise you to buy more aviation lottery tickets, maybe you will win a first prize.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there is only one other way to go: believe in yourself. But no matter which way you go丨丨buy lottery tickets or believe in yourself, I sincerely wish you success.</p>
<h3>Talking About Prison Life</h3>
<p>— Li Kui</p>
<p>Everyone is afraid of prison life. Because once a free "person" enters prison, they become an unfree "object." Like a bird in a cage; the door is locked all day long, and there is no sunlight in the room. Eating, living, and moving all take place in a small room, which is so terrible! However, in addition to being terrible, it makes people reluctant to leave. Although I decided not to go back to prison life after I came out; the impression that prison life gave me is very good. At least it makes me very nostalgic for life in prison. Really. The impression that prison gave me is not very terrible.</p>
<p>Although the food in prison is easy to get sick from, although staying in prison for a long time can easily turn a good person into a cripple, into a dead person! But in terms of spirit, one can indeed get comfort that one cannot get outside. This comfort can almost make people forget the suffering they are enduring.</p>
<p>You can find real friends in prison. Prison is a small society: but the hypocrisy and coldness that exists in the larger society are not present here. Because they are all under the same oppression.</p>
<p>If someone inflicts unreasonable persecution on us, we will resist it together. If we fail, everyone is sad; if we win, we will hug each other and dance. Really, we are not divided from each other.</p>
<p>Prison is full of pure love, innocent love. We are so natural: if we want to hug, we hug to our heart's content: if we want to kiss, we kiss to our heart's content; no one laughs at us, and no one interferes: we are truly melting in the furnace of great love.</p>
<p>Really, this kind of natural love cannot be found outside; just like me and A Qiu, we often hugged inside; now when we meet, apart from shaking hands, there is no purer expression.</p>
<p>Life in prison is full of true love, if you are inevitably dragged there, don't be afraid! It can give you things that you can't get outside.</p>
<h3>Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Yi Li</p>
<p>The rice bowl of the poor is equal to the toilet of the rich.</p>
<p>The buttocks of modern women are as respected as the faces and mouths of wealthy people.</p>
<p>The words spoken by the disempowered mouth are as useless as the garbage in a trash can, and the spittle flowing from the mouth of the triumphant is as noble as the shad in May.</p>
<p>When poor people die, having a son is like having no son; when wealthy people die, even if they have no son, they can still have many descendants.</p>
<p>In life, it is better to die than to be poor.</p>
<p>Women in the lower and middle classes of Shanghai, even if they have never read a book in their lives, they can always recognize dozens of characters. What is the reason? Because they remember the east, west, north, and south in mahjong, as well as the thirty-six gates of playing huahui, only dozens of characters, which they remember by heart.</p>
<p>When children are just learning to speak, they know how to scold people.</p>
<h3>Human Relationships are Cold and Warm</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Who doesn't sigh and say, "Human relationships are cold and warm!" When a person is prominent, everyone will respect them. Once this person unfortunately fails, there is a feeling of separation from the world, and they will be met with contempt everywhere. Conversely, a person who is in trouble will be looked down upon. Occasionally, if they have good luck, their value will naturally rise. What is the reason for this? Because the person is different before and after. Here, it fully illustrates that people are opportunistic. Because they are opportunistic, they must worship the rich and powerful. They must despise the poor.</p>
<p>In fact, people may not be different. When they are rich and powerful, they are this person. When they are poor, they are still this person. The only difference is the environment that supports this person. And a group of sycophants, what they worship is not this person, but this person's position and power. What they despise is not this person, but this person's tattered clothes.</p>
<p>However, position and power are other people's position and power, which have nothing to do with oneself, so why worship them? Because worshiping them often brings benefits, so why not do it? As for tattered clothes, they are other people's tattered clothes, which do not hinder oneself, so why despise them? This is a bit difficult to say. Apart from guarding against them coming to complain and beg for mercy, there is only disgust to explain it.</p>
<p>People are always opportunistic. Human relationships are always cold and warm. I think, if there is a person who goes from triumph to failure, on this road, they can taste two different flavors of life, and also recognize two different faces of the world!</p>
<h3>Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Shu Hao</p>
<p>The floating clouds were running wildly in the sky, and the leaves of the梧桐tree made rustling sounds as they were blown by the wind. The terrifying god of night had executed his authority, covering the earth with a dark curtain. At this time, the surroundings were as silent as death, with only a few dying autumn insects whimpering intermittently. It was dark and oppressive, and nothing could be seen, but looking eastward, there was a faint light shining straight from a small house. From the broken window gap, everything in the room could be vaguely seen. This was a small building that was not even a square foot in size. In the center was a dilapidated desk, covered with untidy books, with writing brushes, fountain pens, and ink scattered in the middle. Next to it was a low stool and a military bed. A kerosene lamp hung in the center of the room, and the faint light came from there. A thin youth, with his face in his hands, disheveled hair, draped over his eyebrows, was sitting on the stool, burying his entire head in his arms. Suddenly, he sighed slowly, and at the same time, he moved his hands, placing them crossed on the table, and slightly raised his head, staring blankly at the dimly lit kerosene lamp. He was saddened by the autumn night seven years ago when his father took his last breath. A happy family was shrouded in sorrow from then on. His poor mother and young sister had gone to their distant hometown due to the pressure of life. And he, without the ability to be independent, had to struggle under the iron hooves of life. He shook his head, unable to continue thinking, and two shining tears flowed down from his eyes.</p>

<h3>Have You Grown Distant From Your Original Family? ·</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a 19-year-old youth, currently working in a customs brokerage firm in this port. My native place is Kunshan, and my family only has a loving mother and a young sister. In addition, there is an elder brother and a sister-in-law.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>My elder brother is doing business in Wuxi, but he has not had any children. About a month ago, a relative mentioned my marriage and introduced me to be a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family. I didn't say anything at the time. Frankly speaking, my environment does not have the ability to marry a wife, but I don't think there is a need to marry a wife, so I have never been bothered by it. Now, asking me to distance myself from my original family, including my loving mother, elder brother, and sister, and go to be a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family is definitely not what I want, but I can't say any specific reasons for objecting other than that. If my mother and others agree that I should go to be a son-in-law, what method should I take? Sir! What do you think is the right way to handle this? I am willing to do anything in case of unavoidable circumstances. Please reply in the newspaper! I am looking forward to it very much. Sincerely wish you well! Ai Jianan.</p>
<p>Answer: I don't know why you are afraid of being a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family. "Distancing yourself from your original family" is your excessive worry, and this is not a reason. Although a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family has to live in his wife's family, his wife's family will never limit the son-in-law's actions and prevent you from approaching your "original family." Whether you are "distant" or "close" to your family depends entirely on yourself, and others cannot force it. You think that you must live in the family to be considered close to the family, which is a big mistake. Such a distance is inevitable for men, and it will not only happen when you become a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family. You are now working in Shanghai, and according to your letter, your family seems to be still in your native place. Isn't this a distance from your family? Therefore, it is not enough for you to oppose being a son-in-law solely on the basis of "distance." The issues that marriage becomes are whether the man and woman get along and the burden of marriage in the future. You should also consider these two points for the marriage introduced by your relative this time. Whether or not to be a son-in-law who lives with his wife's family is not a problem in my opinion.

<h3>Impressions of Chang'an</h3>
<p>— Yunshan</p>
<p>In the third month of spring, I took a trip to the Northwest. I took a train from the capital, Nanjing, passed through the temporary capital, Luoyang, and reached Tongguan. Then, I took a car and went straight to the accompanying capital, Xi'an.</p>
<p>Xi'an is the ancient Chang'an: also known as Xijing. The impressions that I am now preparing to describe have nothing to do with major issues concerning the national economy and people's livelihood. Let the "experts" who develop the Northwest elaborate on their grand theories! My so-called impressions are just like this:</p>
<p>1. Mud in Sunny and Rainy Weather</p>
<p>"Three feet of dust without wind, a street of mud with rain," this is a famous line used by people in the past to ridicule the streets of Beijing. If it is transferred to the ancient road of Chang'an, it will be even more so! The "dust" and "mud" of Chang'an do have their special material basis.</p>
<p>Most of the streets in this ancient city are primitive dirt roads. The Northwest, where there is not much rainfall in ordinary times, is originally prone to dust and sand. In addition, old-fashioned carts are constantly rolling all day long, and long-distance buses are running back and forth. The yellow dust flying all over the city is naturally even more spectacular! If there is a bit of wind, then "the sun and moon will be dim, and the mountains and rivers will change color!"</p>
<p>The mud here is different from other places. First, it is rich in viscosity; second, it is because of the rolling of trains and cars, the road becomes muddy after a rain!</p>
<p>Because the soil is rich in viscosity, the streets often turn into "mud pools" after heavy rain, and you can actually walk on dry shoes on both sides of the road! However, you have to be careful and follow the existing footprints on the road: concentrate your mind! You can't be careless at all; otherwise, there is a risk of slipping into the "mud pool."</p>

<h3>A Sensational Hide-and-Seek in Hollywood: The Peculiar Temperament of Universal Starlet Margaret Sullavan (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jia Mo</p>
<p>Margaret Sullavan, the new female star of Universal Pictures, made a stunning debut with her first film, "Only Yesterday." Its public release garnered praise from audiences worldwide. In Shanghai, it played at the Nanjing Grand Theatre, drawing tears from many sentimental viewers. Achievements that are often difficult for female stars who have struggled for years came effortlessly to this new star, propelling her to instant fame. No wonder she attracts special attention.</p>
<p>Sullavan was originally a famous actress on Broadway in New York. She had years of experience and reputation in the opera house, but only within the confines of New York. Last year, she got married due to a moment of passionate impulse to a lucky man named Henry Fonda. However, after the marriage, they realized they were incompatible and divorced after only two months. It was Sullavan who initiated the divorce.</p>
<p>Because of this romance, Sullavan became the focus of Hollywood film reporters and curious onlookers. As we know, American journalists are not easy to deal with. Moreover, the questions they ask are complex and often delve into private matters. It's bad to answer poorly, and bad not to answer at all. Ordinary female stars always try their best to deal with them, but when it came to Sullavan, she was a "beautiful as peach blossoms, cold as ice" type of woman. She simply felt unable to cope. She then used the "thirty-six stratagems, running is the best" method and fled from Hollywood to New York. Her strong personality broke all Hollywood records.</p>
<p>When she finished filming "Only Yesterday," she suddenly disappeared. Universal searched for her everywhere, wanting to discuss her next film with her, only to find out later that she had fled back to New York. The reason was to escape the encirclement of the interviewers. However, as soon as the news spread, many people followed her to New York, and interviewers in New York swarmed around her like ants attracted to something smelly. This forced her to move to a secret location to live. But due to contractual obligations, she soon returned to Universal. She started filming her second new film, "Little Man, What Now."</p>
<p>Not long after the new film began shooting, she disappeared again. She went to the Hollywood airfield alone, without even a suitcase, and flew to Chicago.</p>
<p>But twenty-four hours later, she flew back. She said, "I was truly driven mad by these many interviewers. I had to fly to Chicago to cool down my anger."</p>
<p>When she returned to the set, the company staff told her, "Tomorrow is the 67th birthday of the company's president, Carl Laemmle. The company has assigned you to cut the birthday cake."</p>
<p>"I absolutely do not want to do that," Sullavan said bluntly. She still didn't understand Hollywood customs. Originally, this was an honorary task, because she was considered the number one female star in the company. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Girl from Tenth Avenue"</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>I Believe in You 丨 Da Shanghai</p>
<p>If you go to see "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" with high expectations, you may be disappointed, because not only is there no exposé, but it is also a malicious distortion of reality. Clearly, "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" presents the masses' writers from the perspective of American gentlemen.</p>
<p>The so-called labor movement revolutionaries, mass poets, mass painters, and mass dancers are maliciously regarded in "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" as alcoholics, sexual deviants, and unscrupulous people who make a living by deception and exaggeration. What we see on the screen are a bunch of drunkards, gamblers, thieves, lacking integrity, and without true friendship or love. What does this explain?</p>
<p>First of all, American gentlemen no longer dare to close their eyes and not see the expanding influence of their enemies among their masses丨丨referring to the general middle class丨丨, so they need to create some rumors and take some fictional</p>
<p>"facts" to confuse the public's vision.</p>
<p>Secondly, among the mass liberation movement activists, some people are currently living romantic private lives, allowing gentlemen to seize upon and exaggerate these points to carry out slanderous conspiracies. However, we know that no matter how austere Gandhi's personal life was, he was always an agent of British imperialism, and the romantic nature of mass liberation movement activists from the petty bourgeoisie is unavoidable. Only through practical tempering can they discard it. Moreover, a person's life is multifaceted. The fact that they strenuously engage in the mass liberation movement to advance history is naturally a cause of great distress to the gentlemen. Therefore, the gentlemen's deliberate exaggeration of the romantic side is a shameless act, isn't it easy to understand?</p>
<p>In any case, we should admit that "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" has completed its mission very skillfully. "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" is actually writing a love story, but it can shed the clichés of all Hollywood love stories丨丨that cheap happy-ending.</p>
<p>American gentlemen see that in their path of decline, many intellectuals are wavering and moving towards the historically progressive class, such as the female protagonist Marie in "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" (although it cannot explain in detail why she is wavering, it at least tells us that Marie is an intellectual with a strong sense of justice). They become afraid, so, through the mouth of a wealthy court critic, Michael, they use all kinds of unfounded provocative fictions to incite her weak soul: not only that, the theme expressed in "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" is that mass liberation movement activists are unreliable bad guys, and trustworthy are the gentlemen's court critics. And most cleverly, "The Girl from Tenth Avenue" actually allows Marie to become a "female writer" and "struggle" "alone"!</p>
<p>What is "struggle alone"? It is to separate the middle class from the leadership of the historically progressive class. If a grand reunion were to occur according to the general convention of American-style love stories, the audience would easily forget it immediately as a general convention, but now, there is clearly a question placed before the audience: Where exactly did Marie go? Isn't it? The kind of hazy fog symbolizing the future seen on the screen, Rosemary Ames squeezing alone in the crowd following the camera, and the sheep-like expression revealed on the face of this new star, emphatically raise this question in front of the audience, and in fact, pull the female writer into the gentlemen's camp!</p>
<p>As a result, the audience sympathizes with Marie, detests Keith and his companions, and admires Michael. This is the gentlemen's entire conspiracy!</p>
<p>The acting of Rosemary Ames and John Boles, especially the former, is successful.</p>
<h3>RKO's New Star: Francis Lederer</h3>
<p>— Lei</p>
<p>Francis Lederer, Hollywood's brand new star, recently starred in RKO's "Confessions of a Nazi Spy," appearing on the screen and meeting the world.</p>
<p>Lederer was born into poverty. His father was a mediocre leather merchant. He was determined to study diligently from a young age, and was very intelligent. He was particularly interested in sports and drama. When he graduated from the Prague Academy of Dramatic Arts, he received the highest honors and earned the reputation of a top student. Afterwards, he studied the structure and composition of scripts from an old actor, working tirelessly, and finally put his acting career into practice, traveling to major cities such as Berlin, Vienna, and Breslau. Because he was good at performing famous plays by Shaw, Ibsen, and Shakespeare, his reputation rose. He even co-starred with the famous actress Gitta Alpar in the play "Romeo and Juliet," which shook Europe. British people remotely expressed their admiration and hired him to perform at the Royal Theatre.</p>
<p>Initially, Lederer did not know English, so he hired someone to teach him. After several weeks, he memorized the dialogue of the characters and the lyrics of the songs, concentrating on memorizing them. As a result, he produced many pure English operas, which caused a sensation in the British Isles. They were performed continuously for eleven months. It can be seen that his magic is truly astonishing!</p>
<p>At that time, RKO's representative in the UK, Mr. Deng, met Lederer in the UK and fell in love with him at first sight. He firmly invited Lederer to perform in New York. Thus, this European theatrical giant crossed the Atlantic and contributed his life's masterpiece to the Broadway stage. His plays were performed in New York for another eight months, and he became a world-renowned actor.</p>
<p>Recently, he changed his goals. He gave up his stage life and jumped into the silver screen of Hollywood, striving hard. In RKO's "Confessions of a Nazi Spy," his brilliance was initially revealed, which was enough to surprise and praise people! Truly, he is not only a world-renowned stage actor, but also a big star on the silver screen.</p>

<h3>Till the Seas Run Dry and the Rocks Decay (Registered Nurse) (Part 4)</h3>
<p>— Jie Hua</p>
<p>Punden packed up some tools and went to the operating room. Hatway was very happy to see her coming and asked her in a loud voice, "Is your mind stable? Good! I'm going to saw open her skull first 丨丨there's clotted blood blocking the blood vessels inside 丨丨She's gone crazy 丨丨It's been very bad for the past day or two." He explained the symptoms of the disease honestly, feeling that Punden would definitely understand. Unexpectedly, Punden's hand loosened, and the tools fell with a clang on the tiled floor. Hatway looked up and was startled to see Punden with her mouth wide open. At this moment, Shules was standing behind Punden and quickly stepped forward to support Punden. Punden wiped her forehead with her hand. Hatway looked at her with both shock and pity, and quickly said, "You're too tired. Go home and rest." Punden thanked him weakly and retreated from the operating room. Shules thought that this matter was a bit strange, Punden dropping the tools on the ground and walking away at a critical moment 丨丨 was a rare occurrence. She said to Hatway, "She just heard you say that the patient was crazy, and she was so scared." Hatway pondered. He remembered that there was also one time before when she helped him treat a mentally ill person. She also suffered the same stimulation. This is really the strangest thing. Punden in the hospital, still busy going back and forth, and Frank and his brother competed to greet her, making her even busier. There was also a young mother who was about to give birth, with a dying child next to her. Whenever Punden had some free time, she would go to see the mother and child. At this time, Hatway's surgery was successful, and the woman had regained consciousness 丨丨 which made the painful traces on Punden's face fade a lot. But Kangnaolai found her again. She was preparing a vegetarian meal for a patient in the cooking room. "Pun, what's going on? Don't you ever want to be happy?" He lowered his head to her, his sincere eyes searching her face. "Let's go out and play, we can have a very happy time, you and I!" After he finished speaking, he first took her slender hand and patted it on his face. Punden smiled softly, and completely relaxed all her defenses. When Kangnaolai reached out to hug her slender waist, she just stared at him blankly, without refusing. After a while, he hugged her tightly and whispered in her ear, "Pun, you are so lovely, I'm crazy about you!" Hearing his words, Punden unconsciously raised her hand and stroked his head. At this time, their faces were close, and their lips were getting closer and closer. Suddenly, Kangnaolai's arm hugged Punden tightly, and his lips were pressed against her mouth, passionately sucking and kissing. In this moment of confusion, Punden also kissed him back. But a moment passed, and she immediately pushed him away. Kangnaolai still tried hard to argue with her, but Punden escaped as soon as she got away. She fled to the window, her trembling hands fiddling with the curtains. Kangnaolai stared blankly at her back, not daring to chase after her, but wasn't she just kissing him back? So he mustered the remaining courage and ran up 丨丨 he knew that women were all about the same, and could never escape his grasp. He walked up and gently put his hands on her shoulders, slowly turning her around. Then he fiddled with her chin with his fingers, raising her face. Then he looked at her face and softly asked her, "Pun, what's going on? Don't you like me?" (To be continued)</p>
