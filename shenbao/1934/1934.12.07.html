<p>時評</p>
<h3>全國職敎會議開幕日獻辭</h3>
<p>敎育部乘這次職業勞作成續品展覽會開會之便。召開全國職業敎育會議於首都。頗爲國人所注意。會議定在今天開始。後天閉幕。參加入員有職敎專家和各機關代表。所討論的。則有職敎行政上和組織上的各項問題。以及推進職敎。實行職業指導。訓練職業師資等辦法。並於會議期間。舉行敎部職敎設計委員會。共商進行大計。</p>
<p>自從國民會議第二次會議通過國政府所送議的「確定敎育設施之趨向案」以後。提倡職業敎育的聲浪。又驟然熱閙起來。大超過民八九年間的形勢。僅就敎育部方面説。旣有詳細的職業學校規程各省市推行職敎的程序。又頒布了職校各科的敎材大綱。課程表。及設備概要。旣有各省市職校師資登記及訓練辦法大綱。又確定了職業敎育在中等學校經費中應佔的比率。此外如派遣專員到各省實地視察。經織職敎設計委員會等。亦都著有相當的成績。</p>
<p>不過一種事業的推行。只有策動的重心。而不兼顧周圍的環境。和倚賴。多方的合作。仍難顯著成效。而最重要的關鍵。則尤在於根本方針的把握。我們不能不承認現在的社會方面。依然充滿着封建思想。中上階級大半迷信於「正途出身」的傳統觀念。不肯輕易令其子弟去修習職業或從事於實地的生產。而做子弟的在小學六年或初中年畢業後。亦大半喜歡升學。除非家境困難。不欲參加低級的生產工作。至於一般的商店工塲。墨守成規。不求改良。又寗願維持舊式的徒弟制度。絶不重視新式的職業敎育。職敎前途。有此種種阻礙。已是危險。何况又加以師資的缺乏。設備的簡陋。和畢業生出路的困難呢。所以一方面政府當局儘管在興高采烈的提倡。一方面却有人在躭憂着急。以爲第二次職業敎育的總崩潰時期。相去巳不遠了。</p>
<p>我們又覺得過去十餘年來。關於本問題的討論。多半是枝節節的。很少把握到根本的方針。本來世人對於職業敎育有兩種的看法。一種是以職業爲目的。以敎育爲工具。歐美各國最初提倡職敎的動機。卽在利用敎育爲發展或求得職業的工具。結果不免把職敎的内容弄得太狹窄了。使他喪失了社會性。另一種的看法却高明多了。他爲職敎有兩重的價值。一方面是借敎育來準備個人的職業。使人得其所。一方面更以職業供給敎育的機會。使得敎育更爲豐富而有意義。前一種價值側重在職業方面。後一種側重在敎育方面。雙方應該同時注意。而不當偏廢。不然。如辦理職敎的人。只想利用敎育爲工具去解决職業。或以敎育的理論去創立職業。而不知道就已成立的職業去實施敎育。或在已成立的生產機關中去講究敎育設施。結果那得不變成學校式的職業敎育呢。這種職敎所造就的學生。只配做書生工匠。又那裏談得到直接生產。</p>
<p>要獲得上文所説的第一重價值。必得注重擇業指導。務使被指導者的特殊才能。可以和他的社會服務相適應。要獲得第二重價。值必得寓敎育於生產的環境之中。在生產中去訓練職業。纔是眞正的直接的職業訓練。所謂「學有所用。用本所學。工以助學。學以助工。」的目的。便可自然的達到了。我們敢乘全國職敎會議開幕的。日子。把這點意見貢獻出來。</p>
<h3>美空軍準備二次編隊遠飛</h3>
<p>造艦程序加緊進行</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　當此海軍飛機數十架軍艦十餘艘正在夏威夷洋面尋覔澳洲飛行家二人之下落時、海軍部長史璜生復宣布海軍航空隊飛往夏威夷或斐律濱之長途飛行仍將舉行、謂此項横跨太平洋之長距離飛行、與明年夏季在阿魯森羣島附近舉行之海軍大操有關、故勢在必行云、此事雖尙無具體計劃成立、但海軍航空隊或將于大陸及阿拉斯加至夏威夷羣島往返飛行、作爲明年七八月間在阿拉斯加之阿魯申羣島附近舉行海軍操演之一部、艦隊在阿拉斯加附近操演完畢後、或將由海軍飛機爲前驅、急速開往夏威夷、史璜生對此表示、去年春天海軍航空隊自大陸飛往眞珠港成功後、海軍部卽開始考慮此項長距離飛行計劃、美國大陸·阿拉斯加·夏威夷·斐律濱及其他美國屬地間之聯絡飛行、實爲必要之正當練習、去年春天編隊飛行之成功、足以證明海軍飛行人員及海軍飛機實能勝任此項長距離飛行、關於一般海軍備、史璜生稱、海軍部無意變更其在一九四二年前使海軍實力達於條約所許限度之計劃、史氏復表示、海軍專家鑒於日本或將廢棄條約、現在考慮必要時加速造艦之辦法云、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>主張三國切實普遍縮减</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美總代表台維斯今日第一次公布美國海軍之地位時、重申美政府維持華盛頓海軍公約所定海軍均勢之主張、台氏謂以軍備平等爲根據所提出之代替辦法、將不能收安全平等之效果、美國贊同逐步的减縮、渠奉羅總統之訓令、已提出海軍軍備切實普遍的减縮、依以實行、可不更變海軍條約所規定之比較的實力、且可不危及參加各國之安全、因於减縮未獲妥恊、渠巳聲明吾人仍凖備遵守華盛頓海軍公約、並賡續倫敦海軍公約、而僅加以環境所需之細則修正、俾獲簽約國之熱心贊助、台氏又謂一九二二年條約中之諸原則、一經廢棄、勢必引起不安穩之狀况·國際之猜疑·及浪費之競爭、而無一國可獲眞正之利益云據華盛頓路透訪員電稱、美人視台維斯公布之言論、爲美政府意見之負責的表示、此爲第一次正式解釋美國之目標、羅總統與國務總理赫爾對此問题均未發表意見、有向詢問者、均交台維斯作答、美國提議切實普遍的軍縮辦法、雖前從未正式宣布、但海軍部長史潢生曾宣露如英日兩國同様辦理、則美國可允縮减海軍百分之二十或更高於此之意云（六日路透電）</p>

<h3>休會説言之尙早</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　倫敦方面傳來消息、謂日本一旦宣布廢止華府海約、則美國將退出海會談話云云云、本日務卿赫爾宣稱、此項消息失之過早、又謂美國海軍代表團仍希望能成立限制海軍之恊定、現在談話旣仍繼續進行、日本方面亦未正式表示宣告廢約之意、故美國海軍代表團仍逗留倫敦云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意拒廢約具有充分理由</h3>
<p>華府各條約相關聯</p>
<p>日本行動和平之敵</p>
<p>羅馬　浿繫黨勞動報撰文、對於日本欲令意國與該國同時宣布廢止華盛頓海約、而意國予以拒絶之理由、加以説明、謂意國未見有任何理由、當與日本恊同宣告廢約、緣意國之志、欲使其海上軍備與歐陸最强大國家（指法國）並駕齊驅、華府海約對於戰鬥艦、及航空母艦兩艦種、規定意法兩國噸位相同、故意國願望已有一部份實現、此意國不贊成廢約理由之一也、不寗惟此、華府海軍條約、係華盛頓會議所簽訂全部條約之一部份、（按一九二一丨二年華盛頓會議、曾締訂三種條約、一爲海軍條約計二十四條、一爲九國公約計九條、一爲四國恊定、計四條、後者由英美法日四國簽字、其主旨爲保持一般和平、及維持並尊重各該國在太平洋地方所有島領島屬之權利、以代替一九一一年七月十三日之英日三次同盟、）無論日本如何説法、海約與九國公約及四國恊定實互相關聯、而不可分離、今若宣告廢止其一、卽係宣告廢止其他、故就建設方面着想、華府海約宣告廢止之後、務當由關係各國另訂新恊定以代之、夫日本單獨行動（指宣告廢約）已足引起糾紛、又况意大利雖泱泱大國、但對於太平洋事件之關切、不若英美兩國之甚、今若由意國參加日本行動、則其結果、僅足使國際關係趨於混亂耳、意國拒絶理由充足、由此可以明見矣」云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）　半官式政治外交通信報對於日本行將宣告廢止華府海約一事、撰文加以評論、申説德國對於倫敦海軍談話之演説、係以「客觀的觀察者」地位加以注視、謂「日本所提出之海軍要求、不僅爲無限制的權利平等、一如德國對於軍備問題所要求者、且欲其海軍軍備在量的方面與他國並駕齊驅也、日本主張係以島國地位及遠東政局爲依據、不過美國始終以爲此項主張不足爲憑耳、」該報結論、謂「歐洲各國海軍軍力比例問題、一旦趨於尖鋭、則德國固不能漠視而無動於中也」云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>英國海軍將大加擴充</p>
<p>（倫敦）　歐戰時英國海軍總司令裴蒂勳爵、今晚在、皇后廳」發表演説、對於英國巡洋艦艦數太少一層、再度表示歉意、謂「予所慮者、並非日本所要求之海軍平等、蓋日本人如果需要平等、必須以相當代價出之、予所慮乃英國須有巡洋艦七十艘、始足敷用、今竟以七十艘所負之任務、交由五十艘（倫敦海約所許可之限度）擔負之、此其失策、詎非嚴重之尤、予敢正告諸君、明年海軍會議若能召集、則此項錯誤、卽應在會議之際設法補救、庶英國不致再度接受約朿、以危及本身安全、換言之、卽應自由建造巡洋艦、俾與吾人所擔負之特殊責任相稱、斯可矣、或謂建造軍艦需費甚巨、英國海軍部是否有此財力、不可不計及之、則答以他國用於海軍之經費、類皆較英國爲巨、尤以美國爲然、安見吾國無此財力、抑知維持海軍兵力一舉、關係英帝國者綦重、此層政府務當知之、卽吾人亦當盡其言責、海上霸權一失、卽無恢復之望、歷史上不乏前例、吾人其愼之云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）　　（倫敦）　每日電聞報載稱、英國海軍士兵及軍官員額、將大加擴充、明年預算案卽將計及此層、該報繼稱、英國海軍在世界各國中、雖占重要地位、然若以人員額數相與比較、則尙不及他國海軍、故有增加之必要、此舉與海會談話結果、並無關係云云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>西北視察記本報特派記者賡雅</h3>
<p>過猩猩峽後之駭遇</p>
<p>十三日下午一時、由馬蓮井啟行、途遇青黑色之沙漠、凡二十里、西北視猩猩峽山嶺、高低斷續、陰暗陽光、且得烟波浩淼倒影千變之癘氣、遙相輝映、景色譎奇、誠非内地所有、再十里、見廢屋基數圈、短碑一塊、是卽甘肅新疆交界之咬牙溝也、過此天已黃昏、月牙斜掛、前行起伏地約三十里、抵一草豐水旺處而宿、是日行程計六十餘里、距猩猩峽站尙有十里、宿處有井十餘眼、垂桶三四尺、卽可得水、惜僅一井是甜水、餘含鹻硝、駝亦不飮</p>
<p>設帳烹茶、一駝伕自外摩柴歸、驚告「遠見燈光、漸向帳房移來、料非善類也、奈何奈何」、護隊原爲七人、因此去猩猩峽石坂井兩站、缺乏草料、不便常駐軍馬、除晨分五人留守馬蓮井外、餘二人卽韓連附馬軍士特隨駝護送出峽、當聞駝伕告警之語、立卽携槍出視、繞帳一匝、絶無毫光、復倩該駝伕引至原處、依向望之、煌煌火光、復見如初、但經注目讅視、厥光非自遠而近、乃自帳房頂洞透照而出、頓悟杯弓蛇影、衆皆嘩然大笑、</p>
<p>次日上午啟行、紅柳白茨、彌望無窮、中雜穗形粉花、繽紛尤爲可愛、惜塞外苦寒、冰雪早至、哀此秋色、不日亦將憔萎矣、十里入峽、初行道路分歧、至此合爲一綫、道旁勁草繁枝、徧掛團團棉絮、若一一收集之、當不下數十斤、蓋棉商自吐魯番哈密運來、過峽出口、小驢驟見草原、競行疾馳、袋破絮出所致、峽口岡巒交錯、上堆石壘無數、推其成因、（一）馬仲英頭次入新、敗退過峽、恐爲追軍所襲、特掘長溝、排立黑石、以充疑兵、此爲民國二十年事、（二）沙漠旅途、鬆質曠野、若遇風沙山洪、卽易掃蕩無跡、故預作石壘、以爲標誌、其用意與蒙古「鄂博」無殊（三）旅人之迷信者、恒壘石擬塔、以禱順利、歷久不倒、心尤竊喜、以上（二）（三）兩項之石壘、所過多見之、創自何時、則不知也、</p>
<p>峽爲乾沙河、遍生馬蓮草、莢實熟炸、狀似蘭花、兩岸危崖千丈、峻峭可怖、風雨剥蝕、孔竅大如臼窠、上建碉樓六七所、下築營壘二三處、其在軍事上之重要、已可概見、峽站舊有居民二三十家、皆被毁燒、無一完者、關帝廟·觀音殿·玉皇閣三寺、各依山勢起建、原甚壯麗雄偉、今亦泥土狼藉矣、郵差𠙦然一身、寄宿廟中、青燈古佛、未識感想何如、傳峽中產石、熌灼如星光、又離峽十里、尙有一星星洞、故名星星峽云、但玉皇閣建修記曁新疆誌書、則稱猩猩峽、究竟誰是誰非、抑係兩用皆宜、尙待考證、</p>
<p>星星洞近處、水晶石甚多、一底叢生數柱、安西人多掘栽木器中、以供賞玩、晶瀅熌光、爲之炫目、出峽三四里之另一關帝廟中、有謂舊陳周盈二尺之大水晶二方、惜今已與廟同葬火窟中矣、廟後將過一人工鑿成之阧險石徑、廟前卽豎一碑誡人小心、俟下石徑、又行沙河、途由北轉西、長二十餘里、夾河高山、險峻天成、山無草木、質多砂崖、黃紅白黑、各爲峯嶺、前瞻羣峯挿霄、勢若雨後春笱、去路茫茫、渺無所見、有謂巉巉黑山、乃石炭之暴露、實則非也、</p>
<p>記者下騎步行、檢玩亮石、正思如此絶地、倘在戰時、誠有一夫當之萬夫難過之勢、不料忽聞「站住站住」之小呼聲、　顧見阿希木奔馳來告、謂「右後方之」小路口、發現携有槍械之三騎者」韓連附　馬軍士在帝聞之、各將所披老羊皮裘、由馬上棄　於地、迅實彈横槍、作射繫式、駝隊亦已息鈴、止而不進、當由阿希木單騎往詢、彼三騎者亦遙遙迎來一人、迨將走近時、又見猩猩峽後路、灰塵起處、高呼疾馳而來者十餘騎、其後皆隱隱灼射槍光、韓連附急向左右山崖一瞥、面容頓現愴白、意若自問「如何得了」、並順口輕聲、令記者「蹲下」、時見阿希木回頭招手、不斷高呼「來來來」、記者步隨韓馬、應聲偕往、彼後來之十餘騎亦飛馳簇擁而至、有綹腮短鬍者、有雜白長鬚者、有着長袍如蒙人者、有穿中山裝軍服、並帶青天白日徽章之帽者、數之共計十四騎、嗣經阿希木介紹、始悉彼等乃哈（密）鎭（西）警備司令堯樂博士派前來迎護之纒兵也、</p>
<p>當卽下馬互相問好、並爲攝影、以資紀念、彼等旋攬轡先馳、片刻卽已遠逝、先是堯司令得安西馬團長之電報、以猩猩峽屬其警備範圍、故亦派兵迎護、來兵欲求速遇、特走小路、若無後行三騎、幾乎完全錯過、纏俗剃髮不剃鬚、故各兵雖有「老將黃忠」之概、但疾馳善射之精神、究無遜色於壯年也、中有長统水卡長「托枯特滿」連長「屯藍可樂」等三四人、能識世故、擅漢語、可備諮詢、盛意尤可感也、晚抵石頭井子、（亦名小紅柳園）計行六十里、設帳煮飯、纏兵早到、先住關帝破廟、亦卽相繼來帳、初讓記者進坐帳房後部之中位、面向帳門、左爲安西韓連附馬軍士阿希木等、居主位、右爲屯藍可樂連長·托枯特滿卡長等一行纏兵、居賓位、無論主賓、皆向上熬磚茶下燒駝糞之火爐、團團圍坐、坐者欲出帳外、各依左右、可走人前、勿走人後、撑帳所竪二柱、與中央地上之火爐、適成直綫、亦卽左右之分界、若由火爐與後柱中間穿過者、（近門所竪之前柱、可無忌避）、或故意搞响火叉者、或僅執鍋耳一端、擦地拖曳者、或飯後將筷擱於盌上、而不遞於「抓鍋（煮飯伕）」收洗者、統稱犯規、例須罰錢、「掌櫃（卽老闆）」犯者、且罰加倍、此種帳房規矩、略與蒙古包相同、</p>
<p>當夜、第一次與纏兵聚首、彼此談話、頗感興趣、記者未學纏語、自難直談、彼等能操漢語者、似亦羞澀而不言、承阿希木出棃招待、并爲任「通事」、始得開始樂叙、記者先謂「諸君遠來迎護、深爲感佩、俟到有人烟處、客另犒謝」、阿希木旋爲譯之、彼等連稱「哈什」（意卽是的）不已、後則齊起舉手致謝、並答「奉命來此歡迎、倉猝出發、連哈密瓜都不及帶來個、路上又没打得黃羊野馬、抱愧抱愧、記者又謂「承諸君遠來保護、己感謝萬分了、」彼等答、「你們和我們、都是」個爹爹（讀疙瘩）養下的兒子、我們來保護你們、也就是弟兄保護弟兄、何况這是我們吃糧人的義務、何須感謝、不過今天相遇所照之相、恐怕不好、我們想再整理服裝、另照一張、記者頷首允之、并謂「戈壁行軍、自難認眞、何况你們軍帽上、用着青天白日的帽章、與中央軍用的一模一様、實能給人以最好之印象」云云、後食手抓飯已、彼等僅連長卡長同宿於帳、其餘弟兄、皆回破廟、各就鞍褫而臥、</p>

<h3>鹽務稽核所整理全國鹽務</h3>
<p>——巳擬具統制鹽業意見書——</p>
<p>——連日研究貢獻財部採納——</p>
<p>新聲社云、鹽務稽核所整理全國鹽務、業巳完成、並擬具意見書、謀統制鹽業、連日由朱所長·繆運司·姚稽核·等在滬研究、將貢獻財政部採納施行、新聲社記者茲探得整理經過及研究統制情形、分誌如下、</p>
<h3>整理塲產</h3>
<p>鹽務稽核所成立於民國二年一月、原爲改良鹽政、整理税收、統一全國鹽務、集權中央而設、並分四個時期、（一）開辦時期、民國二年至六年、（二）組織完成時間民國七年至十二年、（三）地方當局干涉時期、民國十三年至十七年、（四）恢復及整理時期、民國十八年至二十二年、今已整理完竣、關於整理塲產、管理鹽斤之存放、爲整頓税收最要之事務、故整理塲產首在建築會坨、集中存鹽以便管理、從前係由總所提議、於長蘆一區、建設大規模之鹽坨、以爲各區之模範、嗣於川南富榮東塲、建設官倉、商民至今稱便、民國十八年二月、倣照長蘆建坨、决定從淮北入手、現今淮北鹽坨業已告成揚子四岸、皆建鹽倉、兩浙·松江·福建·廣東·山東·皆倣淮北成例建築鹽坨、正在籌備興工、但長蘆在民國四十年間、緝私營隊腐化已極、塲私走漏、無從查禁、由於塲產未能切實管理、縱有良好之鹽坨、走私情弊、仍難杜絶、現目兼辦行政後、建築鹽坨、與整理緝私、同時並舉、事半功倍、收效甚大、故現在淮北私鹽鋭减、税收日旺、如二十二年税收、已達二千一百三十萬六千餘元、雖緣銷額之多、然於塲產管理法、亦極有關係、私鹽來源、全在於塲、塲不漏私、私何有焉、將來閩廣浙松魯等區、坨工告竣、其成效亦當可觀、</p>
<h3>整理運銷</h3>
<p>鹽之產銷、以運輸爲樞紐、鹽有產必有銷、商販運鹽銷售、須於未起運以前、繳納税欵、並准用期票繳納、故運銷爲榷税之根原、銷鹽愈多、税收愈旺、中國行鹽、受引制之束縛運鹽銷鹽、皆不能自由、實於整頓鹽務、大有障礙、稽核所成立後、首即主張改良運制、第一要義、即廢除專商、任聽民人、自由販賞、計自民國三年、至民國八九年、引岸已開放者、有淮北四川兩廣閩晋各區、長蘆亦有一部分、當時成效、頗屬可觀、惜政局不定、有復行改制者、川閩兩區、破壞尤甚、改良運銷、應當絶對自由、果若驟進、必致引起反感、稽核所對於改革事宜、向以漸進爲主、現今暫採過渡辦法、於民國二十一年八月、將浙東温處包商取消、實行自由貿易、開放後、截至本年年底止、五個月内、所收税欵、共有五十八萬三千餘元、比較未開放以前之税收、計增十五萬九千餘元、二十二年三月、山東臨郯費沂四縣、將專商廢除、恢復自由貿易、所有四縣運銷、一律改作自由區域、至於揚子四岸、素稱弊藪、二十二年四月、議定四岸淮鹽、無論在塲在岸、悉以現定牌價、爲最高標凖、准許各商、在標凖法定價下、自由縮减、俾得競售、至於從前號稱淮南四岸者、向以十二圩爲弊窟、淮鹽運圩、例歸運使主管、民國十一年間、淮北分所經理、曾與推州分所、咨商四岸輪運辦法、其時兩淮運使極力反對、遂不果行、現今提倡直接輪運、成效已著、大都係由淮北產區、直運到岸、而由十二圩運往者、仍係帆運、現於廢止帆運問題、正在設法、但商夥船戶、以及圩浦勞工、無一不是食弊之人、整理鹽務原爲除弊、揚　總棧、且當裁撤、何能保留帆運、根本整理仍當改良運制、逐漸進行、以爲施行新法之籌備</p>
<h3>整理税率</h3>
<p>整理税率、民國熑年、承情末之制、税率紊雜、種類繁多、自稽核所成立後、改良鹽税、始將各種税目、一律删除、統而爲、於民國二年十　月、由財政部將鹽税條例公布、並規定劃一之衡量、以備收税及秤放鹽斤之用、於法定衡量未頒布以前、全國鹽務、暫以司碼秤爲衡量、此項條例、規定鹽税、按担徵收、每百斤徵税二元五角、並聲明係暫時　用、一俟鹽法公布後、即行　止、民國七年、又將鹽税條例修正、每担徵税三元、但各區情狀互異、全國均税、碍難實施、然在民國三四年間、實行新税、雖揚子四岸、曁雲南一區、未能按照鹽税條例、每担或超過四元、或超過三元、而稽核方面、主張先税後鹽、革盡從前欠税之弊、確是著有成效、乃自民五以後、軍事頻興、各省因籌備餉需、於正税外、復有附加、各區税率、遂又參差不齊、今從事整理、凡輕税區域一律提高、重税區域、逐漸議减、其中央地方附加各税名目繁多、難於考核、業已分别歸併、凡在產區繳納之塲税、及中央附税、統名之爲正税、在銷區繳納之岸税、及中央附税、統名之爲銷税、其地方加徵之附税、統名之爲附税、鹽税收入、必以銷數爲比較、近五年來、税收遞增、税率之重、雖是一種原因、銷數亦是極有關係、中國人口、號稱四萬萬數千萬人、鹽之總銷額、當可達到五千萬担以上、果能私鹽絶跡、不必加税、而税入斷無不增之理、故對於管理塲產、整頓緝私、努力工作標本兼浥、將來私鹽、當可减少、然後可將輕税鹽斤、實行提高、全國均税、必有達到之日、而新法之行、且當以此爲嚆矢、</p>
<h3>整理緝私</h3>
<p>前清時代、鹽務機關、並無正式鹽巡、惟蘇浙兩省、設有鹽捕營、巡防太湖及揚州一帶、由兩江總督及蘇浙巡撫管轄、所有統領管帶、類皆招撫之鹽梟、其各產銷區域巡丁、多係商人自募、謂之商巡、此項鹽巡、不過爲各專商走私之機關、民國初年、始置緝私營隊、其後於塲區或設塲警、均隸於運使或運副及榷運局、民國十七年、始於財政部内設緝私處、並於各區設緝私局、而塲警則仍隸於行政機關、十八年、仍將緝私局、改歸運使副、及榷運局管轄、及至二十年三月、始由財政部呈准行政院、提交國務會議議决、將各省緝私隊及塲警、改歸稽核機關管轄、均於四五月間、先後由各區接收接管以後、將緝私隊具、改爲税警、並將營制改爲區制、在各分所及稽核處、或收税總局内、設税警課、由各分所經理、各稽核處稽核員、直接指揮、自課長區長、以及隊長之人選、皆由總所考選委派、上自官佐、下至士警、均發給隨身執證、粘相片、載明到差年月、曁出身經騐、及保證人等項、以杜虚冒、並於各區設立税警官佐及税警訓練所、俾使人人能盡職務、人人能守紀律、試以近數年銷鹽狀况爲比例、可證整頓緝私之成效、</p>
<h3>革除陋規</h3>
<p>陋規者蠻相之贓欵、一曰例規、又稱規費、鹽務積弊、莫甚於此、十餘年來、莫之或革、民國二十一年、將行政機關改由稽核方面兼任、自接辦後、當以行政方面、積弊最大者、無過於收受陋規一事、行之已久、安之若素、餽送者認爲應盡之義務、收受者亦視若應享之權利、食婪成風、恬不爲怪、鹽務至此、安得不壞、欲求行政之清明、必以掃除陋規爲急務、乃由總所、嚴令各區、將各種陋規根本剷除、各區兼任人員、均能廉潔奉公、遵將各項陋規、嚴行禁革、於是數百年之積弊、至此萬滌無餘、實爲鹽務一大革新、</p>
<h3>計劃統制</h3>
<p>鹽務稽核所整理全國鹽務完成後、計劃統制全國鹽業、已由兩准鹽運使繆秋杰·擬具意見書、連日由鹽務稽核所長朱庭祺·鄂岸稽核員姚元綸·兩淮鹽運使繆秋杰等、在滬稽核所研究是項意見書、决俟研究完竣後、即貢獻財政部採納施行、是項統制意見、始經財政部採納施行後、對於鹽商、實有益無害、對於國家税收、亦可增力、</p>

<h3>龍山輪船主被日海軍傳訉</h3>
<p>難船偶爾抛泊</p>
<p>應行諒解放行</p>
<p>三北公司龍山號輪、自滬赴西貢、運載洋米、途中遇風、已經脱險、業誌本報、詎料該輪因頭艙進水、至台灣洋面抛泊、抽水修船、因誤停海軍區、發生糾紛、致船主老管、爲日海軍傳去、昨日午後、滬上已得到該輪電報、亟將詳情、分述如下、</p>
<h3>遇風浸水</h3>
<p>龍山輪船身、較泰山略大、此</p>
<p>次自滬開出、係到安南西貢、</p>
<p>運裝大批洋米來滬、在本月三</p>
<p>日、船至佘山南洋面、遇海面颶風襲擊、船主雷斯倍、與惡浪奮鬥、因波濤汹湧、海浪竟冒過船身、以致該輪頭艙内、滿浸海水、在危急時、曾發出來救電訊、嗣幸颶風吹過、龍山輪得以脱險前進、惟因船内進水、急謀抽去、以保安全、</p>
<h3>停船糾紛</h3>
<p>龍山輪前進至台灣海面、船主因頭艙内浸入海水、已超過水</p>
<p>綫、航行殊屬危險、當在該處擇較安全地抛錨停泊、下令全體船員、進行抽水工作、並修理船上爲巨浪擊損之處、不意龍山停泊、爲日本駐台灣海軍區域、不准商輪抛停、龍山輪初未知悉、故甫經停泊、卽有日本軍艦一艘開來、將龍山看住、卽起重大糾紛、</p>
<h3>述明原委</h3>
<p>龍山輪船長雷斯倍、及船内大管輪、當被台灣日本海軍司令</p>
<p>部傳去訊問、雷斯倍等卽乘日軍艦到台灣日艦隊部、備述龍山抛停該處原委、别無他意、事實具在、可請查究、然龍山現仍在該處抛停、</p>
<h3>應予放回</h3>
<p>昨日下午、三北公司接龍山輪大副無綫電報告後、迄昨日尙</p>
<p>未見船主等返船、頭艙内之浸水巳經進行抽水工作、現在前艙水已抽去、後艙之不仍在抽吸中、據船員揣測、如此特别情形、日海軍部必能諒解而予以放回也云云、</p>

<p>十餘萬、而華人約三十餘萬、占四分之三、該地商號、以華人經營爲大宗、而貨物之銷耗、亦爲華人居多數、華僑雖身處異國、但愛國之心、甚爲熱烈、如九一八·一二八·事件發生、該地華僑之捐助、爲數甚鉅、對於服用國貨、尤爲所欲、奈因該地國貨缺乏、無法購買、中華總商會深鑒於此、籌備在該地舉行國貨展覽會、並進行推銷國貨、</p>

<p>華僑亟盼實現　現在華僑均希望國</p>
<p>貨展覽會、早日實現、爲我國國貨爭光榮、同時給華僑好印象、故黃氏此次返滬、將參觀國内各新興工業工廠、同時調查我國國貨、以便歸去推銷、决俟接洽完竣、即由滬返星加坡、再行籌備定期舉行、</p>
<p>施粥廠　至於閘北方面、業經慈善團</p>
<p>體决定於柳營路第二粥廠原址、辦理施粥事宜、惟經費一層、迄未有相當解决辦法、故日内慈善團體方面、將召集董事商議籌欵、一俟商定的欵後、當卽開始辦理施粥、俾資加惠貧民、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　謟笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅迫敷粉學風流</p>
<p>胡嫂子舉起了筷子，不問好歹光就把韭菜炒肉絲，連連的吃了幾夾子，眞個又鮮又鹹。吃了幾下之後，可不能放下筷子了，咬了兩下鍋塊，却又夾了幾絲韭菜，放到嘴裏去咀嚼着。回頭見月英斜坐在一邊，呆呆的望着，這就撅了一大方鍋塊，塞到他手上，笑道：你只管望了作什麽？他請我們吃的，我們就吃罷。我們不吃，也是要領他的情的。月英本待不吃，無如巳是有兩天不曾吃得飽，現在有可以飽的東西揑在手裏，故意的不吃，這也未免太對不住自己的肚皮。而况胡嫂子左手拿鍋塊，右手夾韭菜肉絲，嘴裏咀嚼得嘖嘖有聲，那一股子食慾的燄火，幾乎是要由七孔裏噴了出來，那裏忍耐得住，於是將鍋塊到嘴裏，先咬了一點尖角試試。雖然那東西是很粗糙的，可是經過嘴裏的津液鎔化着，也就香軟可口，不知不覺的，也就把這方鍋塊，送入了肚中。胡嫂子見他手上没有鍋塊，又撅了一方鍋塊塞到他手上，笑道：旣是吃了你就吃罷。月英對於這鍋塊，若是始終不沾染，那也就不會有什麽感覺了，無如這口裏沾染了食物以後，那就越發的想吃，所以這次胡嫂子將鍋塊塞到他手上，他巳不能像以前那樣的猶豫，拿着到手，就向嘴裏塞了進去。不到多大一會兒工夫，手上的也就吃完了。順着這個趨勢，自然也就不會再行中止，結果是把小紀所拿出來的東西，都掃光了。只是罐頭榨菜，未免太鹹，不能吃完，胡嫂子將它倒了出來，就把桌上的舊紙，齊來包了。向門外看看無人，就揣在身上。（八三）</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （乃令）</p>
<p>如果和平是可以從祈禱中得來的，那末，這世界上所發生過的戰爭，我想也不會發生的了！</p>
<p>遇到難解的難關，能够鎭靜處置之，不致束乎無策的，才可說是偉大的人！</p>
<h3>憶杭州</h3>
<p>— 伯敏</p>
<p>雖是十分厭倦都市生活，但，怎樣能回農村？想起生活終久跳不出都市的圈子以外，就不由我永遠憶念那温呑呑的杭州。昨天晚上，承鄉友沈半梅兄邀往知味觀嘗嘗杭州菜的風味，恰巧叔弟正從杭州趕來，席上又遇到剛在杭州玩過的陳君毅黃旭初兩君，當時吃着醋魚蒓菜幾式杭州菜，聽着堂倌滿口的杭州音，談着杭州的種種事蹟；幾疑我們巳置身在六橋三竺之間，回得寓來，兀自憶念杭州勿巳。</p>
<p>提起杭州，這地方眞够人挺歡喜讚嘆；試想古詩裏不是有這末一句嗎？</p>
<p>這是：「直把杭州作汴州。」</p>
<p>這汴州是古時的汴梁，曾爲國都。那巳够人想到在昔的杭州，富麗堂堂，不下於帝子之鄉，何况杭州在南宋時也曾建都。並且還有流行於民間的兩句諺語：而曰「上有天堂，下有蘇杭，」這豈不是杭州之值得歡喜讚歎的鐡板注脚麽？</p>
<p>杭州眞是天堂一般；這地方最曼妙的便是西湖，環湖山色，也十分秀麗。山中湖畔，處處有梵宮紺宇，象徵天堂模樣。還有赤壁夜泛圖中的小划子，有畫舫，眞的佔盡入間風光，我想，如果你是名作家，那末，寫稿的地方，更非選擇杭州不可。</p>
<p>以前我住在杭州，記得每逢巳凉天氣未寒時的傍晚，老是和麗芳不費一錢，踏進湖濱公園一帶，疎散疎散。有時憑欄遠跳，趁着夕陽未下，指點高峯，笑說他年得以買山偕隱的志願。這憧憬眞的永遠記在心頭咧。</p>
<p>我憶杭州！雖然講到都市的典型，杭州遠不及上海，那兒更没有洋大人的氣息。但，這些，幸而杭州没有，才怪够人憶念。</p>
<h3>初冬的文廟</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>秋，巳遲别人間，當你踏在街頭，迎面吹來了一陣寒風，身上曾感到一些冷氣，同時街旁的老樹，又被吹落了幾張黄葉，在地上隨風飄滾，這分明巳是初冬的天氣了吧？</p>
<p>在南市，你如果閒着没事，那唯一的消遣處，也許祇有文廟吧？在這初冬的天氣，當你踏進了文廟，一切還不是和平常一樣嗎？但文廟公園的花是凋殘了，草是枯黄了，樹除了一部常綠樹之外，也都葉子落得快秃頂了，什麽都没有秋天的活潑吧？</p>
<p>在這裏遊園的朋友嗎，誰也不是坐汽車來的，大家都走來的吧？充乎其量祇有少數是坐着人力車來的；因此，當你走到園門，便會體騐到這裏自有一種平民化的意味，這園子並不是少數有閒階級的專有物呢！</p>
<p>在快要枯死了的草地上，「明禮義」，「知廉恥」，那幾塊新生活運動的標語，立刻會使你感到在這裏應當格外的謹愼，勿干犯什麽禁例啊！</p>
<p>你看在走道上，來往的人在接踵的行走，在鐡梗椅上，巳滿處坐着男女，再没有一個空位，大成殿上是那些學者在瞻仰祀孔的遺物，圖書館裏坐滿了看書讀報的一般有志靑年—這便是一幅文廟的初冬之畫的輕描。</p>
<p>— 隱涓</p>
<h3>女扦脚</h3>
<p>— 王莎葩</p>
<p>據說：女扦脚，也是新的女子職業之一！這名詞雖然不大好聽，事體也似乎低微，可是：非但輕便易做，而且進益方面，也着實可觀！每天，四五元七八元不定，能抵一個高級職員的薪給，因爲伊們的主顧，全是些高等西人的家庭，中國人是絶端不會光顧的，伊們每次工作的代價，大槪是一元至二元，據說：這技術，和理髮師一樣的下工夫去學成的，還需要一口流利的外國話。</p>
<p>伊們在扦脚之外，修指甲，也是附帶會的，不過；錢是要另給的了。</p>
<p>在這兒：—善鐘路—是常常可以見到女扦脚的，原因是高大的洋房裏，住的日西人居多數，所以；女扦脚也時常會看到了。</p>
<p>當伊們由西崽的通知後而前去獻技時，長旗袍短大衣是不算一回事，有的還踏着高跟鞋，坐起包車，出進隨身帶了一隻手提的書箱，在不曉得伊們的人看起來，一定還當是女學生，或女醫生哩！</p>
<p>有一個姓陳的女扦脚，想來技術也高，生意也好：每天總有十元以外的收入，伊有一個女兒，是在海格路某校裏讀書，天天坐了自備包車上學呢。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>從作文說到抄襲</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>爲什麽要做文章，這問題說來長，扼要答：人不能没有感情，旣有所感，就不能不謀抒展，用嘴說時，是謂「講話」，用筆寫時，是謂「文章」。而講話除了留聲機能够保存到各百年後外，就無法傳授與後世季的人；並且留聲機在一八七七年前未有發明；旣發明後，任何人也没有把自己的「哀樂之心」，歌詠於蓄音機的便利，故寫文章就成了一種社會事業，具影響於民衆意識者甚强，蘇俄史太林因此說作家是「全民的靈魂之機匠」，甚至有人說法國革命，藉源於羅騷的論文，蘇俄政治的轉變，收效於杜格湼甫等的小說。可知寫文章實在有着自然性的發抒與適應客觀環境需要的兩重意義的。</p>
<p>「無病呻吟」，那内容的實質，會包藏些什麽呢？所以淸人的八股與試帖，在現代不值半文錢，而寫出一生幽怨的離騷，雖則文字很難懂，還是被謳歌着在。這不是說離騷的文藻，比大淸御用才人的製作會一定好，而是相錯之點，就在乎屈原是不得不寫，以吐孤憤；塲屋裏的試題，應試者心中本無有欲，無有思，勉强寫成八股，再尾一個「賦得」；把皇帝大老爺捧了一陣，試問這文章還有什麽價值？</p>
<p>這裏，我們可以知道；寫文章是决不能「言之無物」言之無物的東西，只是蠟製的蘋果，紙剪的花朶，不能嚼，也不能嗅，爲它没有眞實的生命。</p>
<p>然而在這年頭，文人多得不可屈指，在不同的意識階段裏，寫不同的生活實騐，並且也有一部份聰明得可憐的人，自以爲是「文人」而靠「賣文自給」了。賣文換錢，錢換糧食，原是君子眼中的「淸高勾當」，但不幸淸高勾當的造成，却也不能易如拾芥，必需讀幾卷書，走幾里路，用得起腦，拿得起筆；當「心血來潮」之時，拾筆揮寫，一瀉千里，才當得起是一個文人。如果連這些本領都没有，愁眉哭蹙，終日不成一字；而飯又不能不吃，衣又不能不穿，於是乎—於是乎「抄襲」來矣！</p>
<p>抄襲之風，是自古有之的。然而昔人畢竟高明得多。比如杜工部春望起句的「國破山河在，城春草木深」，是相同於唐朝荆叔題慈恩寺塔詩「漢國山河在，秦陵草木深。暮雲千里色，無處不傷心」的。陸放翁的「願將身化千萬億，一樹梅花一放翁」，似偷自柳宗元的與浩初上人同看山寄京華親故詩其詩云：「海畔尖山似劍鋩，秋來處處割愁腸。若爲化得身千億，散作峯頭望故鄉」。—不過這種抄襲，只限於章句之法，仍有作者的性靈在内。也許他們愛好了某人的那一句詩，久藴心頭，當自己歌詠時，不知不覺把他溶化入作品裏，那是不足詬病的。至於明淸筆記，互相剽竊，也是舉不勝舉，可是大家總能在一大段的文字裏，或者顚倒事實，或者參揷另外題材，或者襲意不襲文，拿種種方法避免被人一看就知道是「抄襲」的把戲。</p>
<p>可笑得很，到現在竟有許多「文人」，毫不客氣地把同時代人的文章，也照樣葫蘆的謄了一遍，冠着自己的名氏，送向報館或雜誌去發表。這内在的意思，要不是爲了騙取稿費，供養一己的生活的話；一定是故意向編輯人搗蛋，以爲蒙騙計售，正是譏諷編輯人的所見不廣；（其實中國出版物如許繁多編輯人怎能全經瀏覽又怎能讀後永遠不忘）前者事固可恨，而情有可原，後者竟是潑皮的慣技，罪在不恕。奈何刊物上時時見到抄襲者的被人告發，取消稿酬，而同樣不名譽的事件，依然繼續産生着！</p>
<p>要肅淸文壇，這種「抄襲者」的必需剷除是無可懷疑的——不管他所以抄襲的原因是否爲了生活。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>除掉這一大口玻璃匣之外，另有一口很小的玻璃匣，裏面盛着兩件和那幅匣像無關的東西；但同樣是非常珍貴的。一件是一枚翡翠製的約指，據太后說是乾隆生前所常用的，還有一件是一個非常精緻光潔的鼻烟壺，一般也是用色澤最鮮艶的翡翠所彫琢成的。這些都是價值比較貴重一些的東西。其次就要輪到許多樂器了。因爲乾隆是一個多才多藝的君主，琴棋書畫，無所不通；他對於音樂的造詣，更是特别的高。這些樂器都經他自己親手玩弄過許久的，所以也算是一部份很值得紀念的遺物。</p>
<p>大槪是這位英明無比的大皇帝在生前很歡喜收藏磁器的緣故，他的大部份的遺物便是各式各樣的磁器，差不多佔去了一座大殿的十分之八的地位。這些磁器之中，有不少是景泰藍和古銅色的，識貨的人見了，都知道是很不容易找到的精品。如其一直寳藏到現在，它們的價值必然是十分可觀了！</p>
<p>乾隆的遺物，便盡於此矣！我們雖然都用了特别的重視的態度，恣意欣賞了許久，可是因爲乾隆和我們畢竟也巳距離得很遠的關係，竟不復能於瞻覽遺澤之餘，使我們對他再發生多少誠摯懇切的追念。不但我們如此，便是太后自己，伊也未必有怎樣深切的感覺；儘管在事實上伊就是直接承繼乾隆的權威的統治者，而且伊還時常歡喜提到這位才智過人的祖先，似乎覺得很榮譽，但在伊的内心上，他實在是没有什麽地位的！（一九三）</p>

<h3>呈吳立平先生所異何議</h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>立平先生在其「文學與生活的異議」一文中，對於煥平先生的「文學與生活」提出了兩點「不同的」意見，然而他的所謂「異議」也不過是申述了後者的意見而巳。我們且看看立平先生的「異議」吧：「第一，我不同意「作爲詩人的人」參加實生活可以如實地攝取甚麽形象，能够把生活的眞實和本質表現出來。」理由是「「作爲詩人的人」和人究竟有點不同，他們參加現實生活的態度也有差别，故其生活内容也異。這時詩人所攝取表現的如果屬於人的範圍，則其眞實性就很成問題」了。」高爾基，巴爾扎克並不是「作爲詩人的人」而是作爲「人」去參加實生活，因而「倘要表現生活的眞實和本質，就先得人的態度去生活，只有「直接的」生活才能接觸生活的眞實和本質」否則呢，「對現實生活縱然不是傍視的游戲態度，至少也是以現實生活爲手段的。」（按此語似有毛病，大槪是說的以參觀現實生活爲手段的吧）例證是「歸田爲農」之陶淵明及「爲找詩料而參加滬戰的現實生活」之陳夢家。</p>
<p>立平先生在以上所强調的一點是所謂「直接的生活」而這種「直接的生活」也正是和所謂「視察底的生活」對立着的。我們要求作家投身於現實生活中，從這現實的沃原中攝取自己的形象。這話正是針對着目前一般把自己的寫作局限於「身邊瑣事」的作家而說。强調着實生活體騐在作品製作過程上的重要性，並不會就是抹殺了作家的才能卽所謂「藝術的表現」的重要性。問題得攪得淸爽，討論才不會出岔，立平君在這一點上多少是歪曲了原作者的意見的。我們說「直接的實生活」正是意味着「觀察底的實生活」時常使人們只看見生活的表面，而不能深入生活的核心，因而結果在表現上時常是「不眞實的」的緣故。而並不是說「間接的」「視察底的方法」全然要不得的。一個作家的寫作主題是複什的，假如樣樣生活都要來一個「親身體騐」，那麽他就非「長生不死」或爲索性掉開筆不可，這寗可說是一個笑話。</p>
<p>我們說直接的生活，卽要求作家投身客觀的實生活中，正是要求作家從亭子間里，—假如闊氣點的，那當然應該說是洋樓或别墅了—從自身底狹隘的實生活中解放出來的意思。「走向十字街頭」雖然也可以視察到一部分現實生活的眞相，這當然是好的；然而我們也有權利可以要求他來得更好點：走向農村，工廠去，這也正是說「藝術家能够深入到實際的民衆生活里去，總是比較混在所謂文壇不作什麽事（應該添一句：和作一些「閒適」的事）來得好點的」那使他在目前不能够産生什麽偉大的作品，然而這種可能性總比較照目前那未弔兒浪當下去來得大些，因爲在這現實生活過程中，他的形象的貯蓄將會跟其生活體騐，豐富起來的。同時現實生活是多樣的，複雜的；因而在藝術上，我們旣需要悲壯的進行曲，同時也需要那種能够深刻地體現時代鍋爐中的侏儒的靈魂之苦悶和悲哀的時代底唁辭。</p>
<p>唷唷，扯得遠了呢。</p>
<p>立平先生的錯誤第一是他把作家之參加現實生活和那種間接的觀察生活視爲同一的東西，同時又因爲他對於「作爲詩人的人」和「人一般」之機械的看法—只看見兩者的差别而抹殺了兩者的同一性—因而導出「作爲詩人的人參加實生活不能如實地攝取典型的形象」這一錯誤的結論，甚至以爲「文學家决不是造成的，他不過是實際生活的人，作品也只是直接生活的經騐，他生活並不是爲要産生偉大的作品。中國若有偉大的文學作品出現，也一定不是什麽「作爲詩人和小說家的人」之流的作品。」而其最精彩的，同時也是最錯誤的結論：「文學家不是造成的就等於造不成文學家。」也正是基於其錯誤的觀點而來的。他一口抹殺了現階段一般作家底前途。文學家並不是造成的，而是從天掉下來的尤物。那麽充實作家的實生活的要求該是無益的勾當，而吸引和指導目前一般作家的工作，也就是多餘的了。照如此說，那麽我們對於一般没有充實的生活的作家們不該再有什麽希望，而這帮人如不自動改行，那就得詛咒他們到底不可了哪！</p>
<h3>庫庫拉河</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>星啊没，月啊落，怎啊不見情哥哥，媽打咿嗎噢，爹駡咿呀喲，哭腫奴的眼，不睡不吃喝。</p>
<p>艾里戞勒姑娘，坐在綠草地上，抱恙隻白白地，胖胖地小羊羔子。愁眉不展的仰望着天，手没力的摩着羊背，用又尖又細的嗓子，唱一遍又一遍。</p>
<p>遠遠地浮過庫庫拉河的流水聲，艾里戞勒唱一氣又閉住嘴，側耳靜聽着潺潺水鳴，透過她的心，透過心的深處。</p>
<p>陽光移上了　草，移上了綠油油的沙布爾平原。馬嘶呌着。羊跳躍着。撒着歡兒的牛，跟中籠的鳥一般，東一頭西一頭的顚着。駱駝躺着一動也不動，在晒太陽。</p>
<p>煩惱在艾里戞勒眉上深深地打了個烙印。</p>
<p>——札克巴魯哥哥啊！</p>
<p>眼前又幌着札克巴魯的影子，多麽結實的小伙子，銅肩鐡臂，誰不希罕！藏着笑的醬紫色的臉，一雙活靈的眼晴，噴着迷人的光。當他背着槍從吉巴圖山打獵回來時，嗨嗨着嘴走過艾里戞勒的蒙古包前，艾里戞勒就採頭探腦的看着，直等到札克巴魯走進蒙古包裹，她才没精打彩的拉着沉重的脚回到蒙古包。</p>
<p>艾里戞勒沉默着，一會兒拾起頭來，瞧着　草地上，躺着的，呌着的，跳着的牲口。</p>
<p>焦燥在心内燃燒，她恨恨的推開懷裏的羊羔子，瘋狂的撕着頭髮，站起來走一陣，又坐下用手挖　草根。</p>
<p>一轉眼，扎克巴魯站在跟前，背着槍，左手提着一隻狐狸。他眼光射在艾里戞勒的臉上艾里戞勒混身燒熱，嘴裏說不出話。</p>
<p>扎克巴魯落落腰去摩睡着了的小羊：</p>
<p>—艾里戞勒小姐，你把這隻羊送我吧！</p>
<p>話一說完自己就哈哈大笑，艾里戞勒也明明知道他是在開玩笑，可是自己不說什麽。</p>
<p>艾里戞勒拾着泥塊，朝着對面的羊身上丢，故意的斜着丢在扎克巴魯身上。扎克巴魯笑迷迷的走過來，一把扯住艾里戞勒的手。</p>
<p>—好厲害的小姐！</p>
<p>一陣臉熱，把頭低的垂下。</p>
<p>獃了半天，艾里戞勒才小聲的說：</p>
<p>—你願跟我好嗎？</p>
<p>扎克巴魯點點頭，臉上掛着笑。</p>
<p>—我帶你去看庫庫拉河的水！</p>
<p>天上没有雲，陽光越住越撒嬌，風像是一敗塗地一絲也刮不起了。扎克巴魯拖着艾里戞勒，艾里戞勒又喚着羊羣。</p>
<p>走着，走着，歡快的走着。</p>
<p>庫庫拉河的水淸淸地像鏡子，濺濺的流着綠油油的草罩着河堤，陽光潑在水面上，發出亮晶晶的光。兩岸一片平鋪的綠氈一般的大平原。</p>
<p>札克巴魯扯着艾里戞勒的手，在河沿上踱步，河水的光反照在他們的臉上，醬紫的臉色分外的嬌妍。</p>
<p>白的羊羣在跳躍着，一刻不停地在綠油油的　草地上活動。陽光染了草地，染了羊羣，染了庫庫拉河，染了札克巴魯的眼睛。</p>
<p>暖和的氣候　隻渴睡蟲，鑽到人身上，鑽到牲畜上。一股懶勁兒就上來啦，會呌你没精神，渾渾發沉，眼睛澀巴巴，非睡一覺那才痛快。</p>
<p>兩個人坐在地上，不言也不語，你瞧一我，我看看你。</p>
<p>艾里戞勒的心忽然跳了一下。</p>
<p>她發現了一個秘密，在羊羣裏。</p>
<p>一隻公羊跟一隻母羊並頭睡在一塊！多舒服啊！</p>
<p>含着羞臊低下頭，臉上一陣綠起了火，心撲咚撲咚的跳，不住的跳，渾身好似煮開水。</p>
<p>停了一會兒，她想使勁把這股熱力的抑住，可是怎麽也沉靜不下這顆跳動的心。</p>
<p>——有那天我跟札……</p>
<p>札克巴魯凖眼瞧着他們的神色的變幻，她拍拍心口窩，臉上攤了渴望的神色。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>不知什麽時候從吉巴圖山背後過來一隊人馬，沿着庫庫拉河這邊走，札克巴魯凖眼釘住羣人馬，在百步以裏，他巳經明白了，那是車汗王手下的兵，專管沙布爾平原上的牧民。當這隊人馬在他們跟前停下時，札克巴魯認淸，是車汗王手了領兵的頭目薩齊干，帶着五六十號人馬。耀武揚威的，一齊都下了馬，兇惡的神氣掛在每個兵的臉上。</p>
<p>艾里戞勒嚇得心跳在口裏，兩隻手抱着札克巴魯的腰，閉着眼，幾乎連氣都不敢喘。</p>
<p>札克巴魯兩手擎着狐狸：</p>
<p>—獻給薩齊干大王！—</p>
<p>薩齊干不說什麽，也不接那狐狸。上前一把拖住艾里戞勒，痴笑着問：</p>
<p>—他是不是來搶你的羊？</p>
<p>—不！他是好人。</p>
<p>艾里戞勒渾身直哆嗦，牙巴坷有點發硬。</p>
<p>一個穿黄馬褂子的，走到薩齊干身邊，伏在薩齊干的耳朶旁不知說了些什麽。</p>
<p>薩齊干嘿嘿的笑，笑裏藏着刀。</p>
<p>撲哧一下，薩齊干的鞭子落在扎克巴魯的身上。</p>
<p>—强盜！</p>
<p>艾里戞勒的心像給刀攮着！</p>
<p>—姑娘跟我去吧。</p>
<p>薩齊干拍拍艾里戞勒的肩膀，他被這姑娘迷住了。</p>
<p>撲哧撲哧皮鞭子一個點兒在扎克巴魯身上響着，誰也受了。扎克巴魯忍無可忍的托起了槍。</p>
<p>碰！</p>
<p>薩齊干應聲倒地，接着：</p>
<p>碰！碰！碰………槍聲不住氣的響，一陣混亂，馬跳着，羊四散的跑了，艾里戞勒和扎克巴魯在槍聲裏送掉了性命！</p>
<p>綠油油的平原，平鋪的草地，塗着鮮紅的血，太陽噴着熱力，腥臭澎漲起來。</p>
<p>大羣的兵，把薩整士的屍搬上馬，趕着羊，趕着駱駝，每個人臉上抹着悲哀。</p>
<p>庫庫拉河的水，汩汩的流着，穿過平原，一片綠油油的草地，鑲上了一條蜿蜒的白帶。</p>
<p>遠遠的傳來陣哭呌聲，不知那羣兵又在槍誰的牲口。</p>
<h3>仰光小景</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>住在MaungKhineStreet的一家小茶館樓上，没有什麽事做，也少有人來閒談，每天孤寂的時光，就多半是消磨在臨窗閒眺和一本破的書上了。</p>
<p>書上說的什麽，至今業巳全然忘記，但從窗上看見的各樣生活畫圖，却還明晰地留着深刻的輪廓和色彩。</p>
<p>每天一早和嫩黄的陽光，一同現在我的眼前的，是一個徐徐走在街頭的緬甸僧人。他光着頭，赤着足，披着黄衣，抱着一個漆黑的缽；來到茶館前的街上時，便向我斜對面一家中國人的門口台階走上去。</p>
<p>這是一家頗爲闊氣的中國人，單就進門的屋裏陳設着的精緻桌椅看來，就可以知道的。緬甸僧人並不站在台階上化緣，却是像回家那麽似的，走了進去，一屁股坐在椅上，不動也不說話，默默地，如同一尊不曾盤足而坐的佛像一般。屋裏立卽走出一個花衣花裙的女人，樣子似華人非華人，似緬人非緬人的（這是中國父親緬甸母親生的女子）對着和尙，把穿在足上的拖鞋脫掉，跪下去，恭恭敬敬地叩個頭，才把和尙的缽接着，然後穿上拖鞋，走進裏面去。等一會兒，把裝好飯菜的缽捧出來時，又將拖鞋拖去，再跪下叩個頭。和尙呢，是始終不理地坐着，接了缽後，就一聲不響地走了。</p>
<p>白天間或看見衣衫不整的同胞，垂着短髮不潔的頭，立在和尙去過的那家門前的台階上，呢喃地說着大槪是要求帮助盤　的話語。門裏便現出一個嘴角吊着香烟身穿華式短裝的男人，舉起肥大的手來，不高興地擺擺，隨卽隱没進去，接着鑽出一個瘦小的印度僕人來，連叱帶吼地做出掀攘的姿勢。於是，那位零落在異國的乞憐者，便一面頽喪地走下階，一面回過頭去，氣急地駡那印度人駡道：</p>
<p>「你這黑鬼！」</p>
<p>過舊歷年的時候，這家人的門上，便由那瘦小的印度僕人，掛起一大張中華的國旗來，飄飄拂拂地展在簷下。發着電光似的火砲，也劈劈拔拔地放了許多，第二天早上起來看時，街上舖着了寸多厚的紅色的紙花。先前由那兩個印象上疑心他們大約是歸化了緬甸的，到這時，才明白過來，的的確確他們還是中國人呢。</p>
<h3>明天（十）</h3>
<p>— （Joseph　Conrad著）吳向隅譯</p>
<p>海格波特船長走近一些，身體傾向前，伏在他的剷柄上。「走你的路罷」他惱怒地，同時膽怯地說，因爲他常恐怕被人家笑話。每種心理狀態，即是瘋狂也有其以自尊心爲根基的平衡。即一經擾亂，即將引起不快；海格波特船長生活於牢不可破的觀念系統中，這種觀念，使其感覺别人妄笑含挑起他的痛苦。是的，别人的奸笑是可怕的。他們暗示一件事不對；但究是什麽呢？他說不出：那位陌生人顯然是在奸笑—他的到這兒來存心是在奸笑。更其壞的是在街上這樣幹，不過他以前從來没有像這次一樣激怒過。</p>
<p>這位陌生人，並不覺得那位伏在鏟上頭傾向前面的老人，距離他很近，很嚴厲地對他說：「我所立的地方並没有侵占人家，難道不是麽？我揣想你的廣告也許有些不對。假定你能讓我進屋。」</p>
<p>「你進屋！」老海格波特極端恐怖地囁嚅着說。</p>
<p>「我能够報告一點關於你的兒子的眞實消息——並且是最後的消息，如果你有心要聽的話。」</p>
<p>「不要」海格波特大聲說。他開始大步地走來走去，把鏟放在肩上，另外一隻手亂揮。「這兒一個傢伙—一個奸笑的傢伙，他說一件事有些不對。我巳得到比你曉得更多的消息。我有我所需要的一切消息。我好幾年前早巳有這消息—好幾年前——好幾年前—巳足够我等待到明天。讓你進屋來，眞的！哈利將要說些什麽呢？」</p>
<p>貝珊嘉維爾的身體在會客室的窗上顯了一個黑影；隨後門一響，在另一座小屋前出現，身體一切部分都是黑的，只有在她的頭上面，有一件東西是白的。這兩人的聲音忽然開始在門外講話，（她以前是聽見在屋内的）這給她這樣一種情感，使她不敢發出一些聲音。</p>
<p>海格波特船長看起來像在從一個籠中尋找一條出路一樣。他的兩脚踏在那些他翻起的泥潭中。敗壞的草地上的穴洞，幾乎使他顚躓。他盲目地奔向木栅。</p>
<p>「這兒安心些！」在門邊的男子威嚴地說，伸長他的手臂，抓住他的袖子。「有人想眼着你。哈囉！你穿的是什麽裝束？天呀原來是堅硬的帆布。」他大笑。「哎，你確實是一個脚色！」</p>
<p>海格波特船長脫身開去，開始畏縮地退回去。「至少在現在」他帶着沮喪的口氣說。</p>
<p>「他出了一會什麽事！」那位陌生人用着愼重的請求解釋的口氣，似乎極熟的樣子向貝珊問。「我不願驚動這位老人。」他放低他的聲音，像煞他巳經認識她好幾年。「我偶然在路上走進一家理髮店兩辨士修了一次面，那兒他們告訴我他是有些像個脚色。這老頭子巳經一身是脚色了。」</p>

<p>紗花多頭大肆活動</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、漲風又起、因海外棉市一致向漲、致買方活動、人氣激昂、多頭通成公司大量的加碼、因此市盤乃愈覺緊張、午後聞現紗銷路益滯、因轉瞬年關將屆、客方預備結束、所以紗銷較爲岑寂、</p>
<p>金鷄漲一元</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因外棉一致升騰、買方大爲活動、人心沸騰、多頭乘機購買、市盤愈拍愈緊、各月均漲一元一·二·三·四角、午後開拍市氣頗昂、詎料拍至二三盤、因金價下落、棉市回小、現紗客帮生意冷淡、成交僅五百包、各月回跌二·三·四·五·角、全日成交統計三萬八千包、查賣出達記一千九百包、錦昌八百包、明德五百包、恒德四百五十包、愼記一千一百五十包、頥大九百五十包、泰昌一千三百包、永昌一千四百包、仁豐六百五十包、義成一千○五十包、買進大孚四千包、大豐二千一百五十包、長豐二千六百包、潤康一千包、永大四百五十包、信誠六百包、均昶一千二百包、益昶六百五十包、同和五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>鄭標漲五角左右</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、因印棉一味上漲、空頭恐慌、市氣漲風尤熾、而美棉亦步塵於後、漲二十磅音、查印棉趨漲之原因、謂該處棉區大雨成災、市上來源缺乏、日商買進而大漲、長豐大孚兩戶購進一、二暪擔、致檯面緊俏、各月均漲六角至七角半、午後拍至二三盤、市勢轉變、以金價回小、據某棉業機關消息、明日印棉或有二三羅比之回跌、故人心稍鬆、各月跌五分至一角一角半二角、全日成交統計十四萬三千擔、查賣出長和五千擔、元一二千七百担、同興二千八百擔、源大四千九百擔、賡豐四千七百擔、遠大一萬二千七百擔、昶記一千七百擔、愼記一千六百擔、永昌二千五百擔、義成一千八百　、買進大孚一萬零三百擔、昌記一千六百擔、均昶二千擔、長豐一萬五千一百擔、潤康二千八百擔、大昶四千二百擔、源興昌一千七百擔、源大二千一百擔、益昶二千五百擔、益康四千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>粉昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈一致堅昂之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲九角至一元二角左右、坎拿大漲七八角左右、當開價時、以洋麥之高漲、業内外人心、均爲震動、本月份開價即漲二分、最高時曾至五角二分、遠期各月份、亦猛提二三分之譜、迨至二盤之後、業外之買氣、雖仍暢旺、惟廠方曾有抛售、故人心漸見平平、遠期各月份較初開反小近分、迨至下午開盤、本月份開價曾回進五角大關、至遠期各月份、初傳廠家續定洋麥一船、價四元七角六七分、因此抛貨約有十餘萬包、但業外之買氣、仍然暢盛、致市塲人心、反見俏利、故遠期市面、仍續見良好也、結果本月份較前日漲二分、一月份漲二分七厘半、二月份漲二分半、三月份漲二分七厘半、四月份漲三分二厘半、五月份漲三分云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈穩固挺健之象、以洋麥報價大漲、計芝加哥漲九角至一元二角左右、坎拿大漲七八角、當開價後、近遠期之開價、均較前日暗提四五六分不等、不過結賬巳近、業内外之買賣、同趨停頓、故外麥雖大漲、標凖市况、尙呈平靜也、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、巳告淸寂、價亦依然平定、後又傳洋麥之續定、是以交易更稀、市况亦稍帶軟弱、結果本月份較好四分、一二月份好三分、現麥市况、因洋麥高漲、各檔喊價、計高三四分、開山東歸德徐州麥三元九角七分、次六分、宿州瑶灣麥三元九角二分、六合麥三元八角四分、漢口麥三元七角四分、由福新去五千包、阜豐申大各去二千包、信大去一千包云、</p>

<p>昨日洋米期貨甚爲緊俏、前日洋商喊高五分後、進戶嫌大未成、但至晚上進戶依價收進、共計成交有四千五百噸之多、昨日本街進胃更貪、而洋行扳俏不售、市面更爲緊張、後由合義雅利等售出小絞二千噸、西貢十二月三四月份等共計一千二百噸、四月份西貢巳大至四元一角半、比之前日共漲一角之多、現洋米本街甚活、内地亦復爭辦碎米等、價乃較漲一角及角半不一、共計開出西貢五千三百包、暹邏安南粳等三千包、由本街内地分去、客秈到銷兩旺、内地本街崇沙寗紹各帮均有進胃、統計開出七千多包、價較漲六七分一角及角半不一、</p>
<p>紅糧苞米市氣緊張</p>
<p>—芝蔴洋莊銷路活潑—</p>
<p>近來紅糧苞米、市氣異常緊張、紅糧因大連漲風甚燈、照大連取引所現糧行市、划申須五元七八角、不能合算、但近日去路巳落淡、且津浦隴海兩路有到、所以市况尙未有狂暴之漲風、惟行情總見逐步上漲、昨市計開牛莊紅壳一車、價爲三元八角及三元七角半、蛙埠糧四百五十包、價爲三元三角二分、行情比較前市又漲角外、苞米因有賬客及崇明内地等去路、致見欣欣向榮、價自三元一二角巳漲至三元八九角矣、統計成交數總在八九萬包之上、昨開天津苞米四百包、價爲三元九角、海城苞米五百包、價爲三元八角三分、芝蔴洋莊去路復見活潑、前市曾開九元二角半、昨日漲起五分、聞開九元三角、成交三百噸、故市塲中行家辦胃趨濃行情亦放大四五分、計開揚州蔴四百包、毫州蔴八百包、張八嶺蔴一千包、明光蔴二百包、九江牛奶蔴二百餘包、九江雪蔴百譜包、後情爲辇、聞尙堅　、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<p>美國絲市轉佳之由來</p>
<p>十一月中旬以來、海外絲市、忽呈活躍、頗具復興之象、紐約現絲、每磅自一元一角六分美金、升至一元二角九分、橫濱市價、每担自四百八九十日圓、漲至六百餘圓、上海絲價、亦有相當進展、惟大宗交易、多屬歐方、美銷仍難於暢達云、查此次絲價之忽然見佳、其原因不外美國十月份消用、突然增至四萬九千餘包、同時日本秋繭生産、减少百分之二十八·四也、刻接美國十一月份生絲消費及存底電報、其消用項下、比上月少去一萬一千五百餘包、依此推測、絲市前途尙未許樂觀也、紐約十一月份生絲存底報告如下（單位包）</p>

<p>糖市　新潮靑到稀續漲</p>
<p>昨日糖市因關金續升、但荷滙見長、故趨勢尙平、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通現貨仍十八元五角半、本棧貨及轉口貨均乏變動八九號荷赤高貨十四元二角、普通十四元、比升五分、轉口貨四元九角、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元六角、本廠綿白振裕一號略有開出、價爲十七元七角、又升一角、新潮靑到貨仍稀、依然上漲、昨貴生輪僅到百餘件、黄崗靑及半南靑扯兌十三元二角、比前日又升二三角、</p>

<p>生仁昨日徐州電訊又升二三角、加上一切外費、划申須合六元二角許、但申市以油餅見疲、開價稍降且聞靑島電亦見小跌、故客胃復趨觀望、僅開出郯城仁數百包、價爲六元七角、比前日小一角、徐州仁因地價升、而申市軟、擯持未出、以地價而論、暫乏過小希望、蓋上漲之際、隅過頓挫、亦尋常事耳、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>浦儀照片</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>談起照片，便是我最喜歡的恩物，譬如妓女照片，舞女照片，明星照片，極而至於沿白照片，苟其拍得道地，面龐兒俊俏，我便要買來，把繪圖釘釘在壁上，朝夕相對，殊覺有趣。</p>
<p>因爲照片是一種像眞的東西，倘然没有看見過的女人，如其看見了她的照片，就像看見了這女人一樣。所以拿某女的照片，懸在壁間，似乎便同該女同居一處的樣子，這並不是我「發魘」，像我這樣的「魘生」，我想世界上必定很多。</p>
<p>不但女人的照片可愛，便是山水的照片，或是古人古物的照片，也是可愛。世界上名山勝景很多，往往不能前去暢游，倘然看見了照片，也如前去游過的一般。又如希世之寳，歷史上有名譽的人物，在事實上無法收藏的，無法看見的，假如看見了照片，也如收藏過或親炙過一樣。</p>
<p>此外還有要人的照片，我也澈底喜歡。因爲要人，我彀不上去仰攀，無法去親炙的，倘把要人的照片，掛在壁間，便如同某要人「斗室談心」「前席共話」一樣，不由得自己的身子也龐大起來，豪闊起來，志氣也發揚起來。</p>
<p>還有一種照片，我也喜歡。便是東北義勇軍抗日的戰跡，自「九一八」後，四省淪亡，而東北的一般熱血男兒，愛國志士，不惜犧牲生命，和日軍漢奸肉搏於白山黑水間，此種愛國精神，我實「五體投地」的欽佩。倘然看見了這種照片，一腔熱血，也覺要沸騰起來。所以這種照片也是可愛。</p>
<p>最難看的，便是鍾進士捉鬼，强盜判處死刑，綁出法塲槍决的照片。看了最使人惡心。因爲看了此種照片，旣使人怕，又使人恨。假定我看見了這種照片，便要拿牠拉雜摧燒，毁屍滅跡，决不使牠留着一些兒印像。</p>
<p>溥儀是怎樣的東西，便是日人的傀儡，日人拿來作爲一種欺騙世界的工具。但是總瞞不了東省三千餘萬的人民，瞞不了世界各國人民的耳目。現在僞文敎部欲實施奴化敎育，爲欲麻醉東北四省的人民起見，近以溥儀僭位時串演醜劇的傀儡照片，由僞文敎部，令散全滿各中小學校，懸掛於禮堂敎室之内。「我誰欺，欺天乎？」</p>
<p>我想東北四省雖亡，而東北四省人民的心理，還是未亡。倘然看見了這樣傀儡的一幕照片，一定更覺得亡國的可恥，而日人欺弄東省人民手段的可惡，因此更激起抗日的决心。如此懸掛這樣的照片，倒是爲東北三千餘萬人民留着一個亡國的紀念，不能說他是一件很有益的把戲。</p>
<p>所以同一照片，而發生的感覺不同，有看見照片而發生好感的，有看見照片便表示惡感的，有直接看不出惡感，而間接反映出來而惡感便層層不斷地暴露。因此有善於判斷力的人們是非，曲直，公道，總不能磨滅的，欺蒙的。這樣溥儀的照片，掛在校中，未始不是一種激發人民反抗心理的工具，「讓他掛吧」，</p>
<h3>同情心</h3>
<p>— ＴＴ</p>
<p>在一個嚴冬的晚上。朔風呼呼地呌，雪片像棉花一般地儘在空中飄，大地時靜得怕人。我躱在房子裏，把窗門緊緊地閉着，靠着火爐邊坐着。</p>
<p>我眞想不到老李會在這個時候，到我這兒來。他的臉皮給風刮得紅暈暈，鼻孔流着鼻涕。我料他一進來，一定走近火爐邊，讓身子温暖一吓，可是他即呆站在門邊，門也敞開着。於是我說：</p>
<p>「門關起來吧，蠻冷的。」</p>
<p>門立刻就關了，但他還是木然地站着。</p>
<p>「喂，站在那兒幹嗎？」我站起來道。</p>
<p>他這才步近火爐伸手烤着火，默默的。</p>
<p>我驚訝地盯着他，我怕他是神經錯亂了。</p>
<p>突然，他吃力地握着我的手，很認眞地說：</p>
<p>「老木，人對人應不應該有同情心？」</p>
<p>「自然應該有的。便如這樣冷的天氣，我連一條薄毡都没有，難道你眼睜睜地瞧着我凍僵，而你的床上，却擺了三三條棉被不成？」</p>
<p>「那好，請你就跟我一起到我的家裏一吓。」他跳起了，嗓子高高地呌。</p>
<p>「冷得要命，到你家裏幹嗎？」</p>
<p>「看看我的房子。」他朝着門口，用力拖着我的手。</p>
<p>没有法子，只好披上大外，同他一起走上街去。</p>
<p>風一陣陣地往身上衝來，臉龐括得有點兒痛，低着頭，像是在作長途賽跑似的開着大步走。</p>
<p>整條路，冷淸淸地祗有我們二個人，讓白雪灑滿了身上，間有一二架汽車開足着馬力，從我們的身邊，飛奔地駛過去，老李便發狂似的駡道：</p>
<p>「媽媽的！自己坐在汽車裏，看人家灑着雪，眞没有同情心。」</p>
<p>「媽的同情死，他管你凍死。」上下的牙齒打仗着一說一頓的。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈！」老李兩手朝天舞動着。</p>
<p>我的心房一震。「老李該是犯了神經病吧，」到了他的寓所的門口，他把全身的衣服，的袋子，都摸了幾遍，鑰匙終於没曾找到，他急迫而又焦躁地搥着門。二房東的娘姨，大槪是睡得巳濃吧，搥了好久，門才閃開來。</p>
<p>「媽媽的，睡得蠻舒服，人家站在門口，……眞没有同情心。」他一頭步上樓梯，一頭駡。</p>
<p>在他的房裏，我發覺床上的棉被不見了，我以爲是他拿到當鋪去，我笑着問道：</p>
<p>「老李，被窩送到平民銀行去嗎？」</p>
<p>他打開了了抽屜，拿出了一條字條，呌我看看，裏面是這這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「老李，老天呌我來偷你的棉被，就請你原諒吧！你的友朋Ｃ」</p>
<p>「老陳嗎？豈有此理，他怕冷，别人就不怕冷嗎？找他拿回來。」我有點氣忿地說：</p>
<p>老李拍着我的肩膀，哈哈地笑，接着便說：</p>
<p>「人對人應該有同情心呀！」</p>

<h3>市夜</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>十一點敲過，從大光明影戲院里看了「窈窕淑女」出來，擠到了門口，長長的嘘了一口氣，正了正衣襟，沿着士敏土的人行道上走去，脚尖兒點在地下，打出那不合節奏的拍子，心裏却在計算着往那一條路上去。</p>
<p>市招上的霓虹燈正在對行人瞪着眼，商店門前的「大减價」旗幟無力的垂了頭，人是彷彿瘋狂般的在街中溜，一輛一輛烏溜的新式澳司汀，雪佛蘭汽車，在柏油馬路的脊柱上爬過，最高，最偉大的立體派建築物，靜靜地矗立在空際，尖兒頂着天幕。冷峭的寒風，把地面上的塵土都捲了起來：我不禁打了一個寒噤，把頭拚命的向領頸里縮。</p>
<p>懷着一顆寂寞的心，茫茫然的沿着馬路闖去，街頭的夜鶯在唱着悽厲的悲歌！</p>
<p>——大少爺！大先生！捨給窮人一個銅板，讓我去買半碗粥喝喝！</p>
<p>——先生！那麽冷的天氣在風里走，不如到我家里去坐一歇吧！</p>
<p>不提防來這麽一着，我竟給她們嚇了一大跳，猛的把身子一扭，掙脫了她的手，跑了幾步，機械地把頭掉過去瞥視她們一下，見她們在望着我𠺝𠺝𠺝地痴笑，不，這是不自然的苦笑！</p>
<p>經過一家跳舞廳的門前，裏面悠揚的旋律把我的心魂攝住了，從大門里旋出一對靑年男女來，臂兒挽着臂兒，肩兒並着肩兒：抹了一個灣，又溜進了一爿冷飲店里去。</p>
<p>走路帶些華爾滋的步調，講話夾着「伴舞之歌」的味兒，水綠色的夾旗袍，窄窄的纖腰兒，一對發育均衡的乳峯，顫巍巍地在胸前抖動，嘴角上常掛着一絲媚笑。這逗人的肉感呵！呌老和尙看了也要思凡的。</p>
<p>那時我已踱到了另一條馬路上，這是一條冷落得等像死街似的馬路；這兒看不見女人的笑，更聽不到雷夢娜的歌聲，祇有三兩個黄包車夫，拖着一輛空的車子，有氣無力地在街中躑躅。</p>
<p>然而同時在别一條馬路上，却一輛一輛的摩托卡都撥動了引擎，「嘟！嘟！嘟！」的幾聲吼呌，把這些舞倦酣醉的紳士，太太，少爺，小姐們載了回去</p>
<h3>指甲</h3>
<p>— 陸印全</p>
<p>深秋，一個紫丁香那麽淡愁的季節，這樣的季節裏，是最適宜於孤獨地靜坐一會的，没有令人眩目的陽光，淡風也好像怕吹痛人底嫩膚般的，只是軟軟的吹拂着。這時候，最好不要瀏覽書籍，知道麽？書籍是一陣揉亂恬謐的心的朔風：要是你不慣的話，那可以吸一枝淡味的捲烟。至於我麽，我是慣於這樣靜坐的，我時常把手指含在嘴裏，用牙齒來把指甲的尖角慢慢地磨光，在指甲的磨琢裏，我會將這麽多的光陰都欣快地溜過去了。這對於我確是個最大的安慰。</p>
<p>今天，一個紫丁香那麽淡愁的深秋下午，在破舊的南窗下，坐了下來，又要把自己底手指欣賞起來了，可是我把手指曳起來的時候，我却吃了一驚，怎麽，這指甲上粉紅色的curtex都凋落了呢？我便有點兒抑鬱了。</p>
<p>你知道，那是爲什麽要抑鬱呢？這是粉紅的Curtex，是離家時妻替我抹的。那時，我倚臥在籐椅裏，手指照例的含進嘴裏，正胆怯地怕懼着將要光臨的離别味。而妻却飄飄地從外邊跑了進來，看見我底雙手，便說：</p>
<p>——你看，自己的手指這麽髒，還含在嘴裏。</p>
<p>她把我底雙手取了下來，混和地撫弄着。多混摸一些吧，我想，分别的時候一殺便要到了呢。而她似乎不感到什麽地仍然很歡喜！</p>
<p>——我來替你洗，還搭上些Curtex，好麽？</p>
<p>並没有呌女僕，妻自己把面盆端了過來，等到那淸水將我指甲間的積垢完全刷淸了以後，她還拿粉紅的指甲油，一抹一抹地塗着。看着她那靑葱般的纖指緩緩地移動，我是再也没有這樣快樂的了。</p>
<p>離開這温柔的家鄉時，妻還帶了些感傷的成份說：</p>
<p>——願這抹Curtex作爲新婚的紀念品吧！可是現在，到這裏來剛只有幾天，這作爲紀念品的指甲油竟這樣地凋落了，呌人能不黯然呢？</p>
<p>夕陽巳經給歸鳥馱去了，而我還呆坐着，呆望着自己底指甲。我是遺失了一個柔夢麽？我不知道。只有神志巳有點昏迷了。從此，我不要再欣賞指甲了吧，因爲牠將給我以酸味的記憶。於是我把兩手放了下來，站起來跑到門房裏看信去。</p>
<p>我希望那門房的一大堆信裏有着一封我所最熟悉的淸秀的字跡的信。</p>
<p>業餘信箱</p>
<h3>「一元三天」的聲明</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>日前業餘信箱登載「一塊錢三天」一文，與事實上稍有不符，故不得不向先生聲明一下。</p>
<p>朱福民君今年巳十七歲，他的身高和成人一樣，似乎不能算小孩子了。當朱君接到通知到敝處來之時，曾講明「先試做三天，三天後雙方同意，則覓保正式錄用」。但朱君未將此話報告家中，致引起朱君母親及哥哥的誤會，這誤會敝處當然不能負責。</p>
<p>惟朱君母親在三天後的隔晚，忽至敝處吵鬧，雖經敝處將現行投考規則，及曾講過「先試的三天」等語向伊說明，伊終不理，一味說敝處欺騙，滑頭，約有半個鐘頭，方始回去。</p>
<p>洗擦銀器是敝處每天所需要做的工作。那天朱君擦的並非數十隻銀盾，而是數隻銀杯。銀杯本來都是光可鑑人的</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，祇需揩去一些手印及盒子上灰塵就可。朱君說手指上擦得有了細泡，而現在敝處正式錄用的兪君擦了半個多月，倒並未有發現細泡，這眞有些奇怪了。</p>
<p>朱君不錄用的原因，敝處爲朱君計，不必再說明，總之是不合於敝業，故履行「先試做三天」的約言，將朱君辭去，這當然也不能說是敝處錯誤。此請撰安　　光華眼鏡公司啟</p>

<h3>幾乎成爲事實的琪恩哈羅喪明之痛（下）</h3>
<p>— 蜜薺</p>
<p>「醫生旣然診斷了琪恩哈羅的眼晴燒壞了，他就要用起手術起來。他用手術的法子，就是將那層燒焦的透明眼膜割去，因爲那層眼膜燒焦之後，已經縐了起來，并且發乾發硬了。我於是等到「地獄天使」完成之後，就立刻去割治。那割治時候的痛苦，當然是不言而喻的了。我自從割治之後，差不多過了十一月之久，天天到帶着墨色的眼鏡，靜待我的眼睛，慢慢地生出一層新膜出來。醫生在這將近一年之中，除去必需的短時刻之外，絶對禁止我看書，或多用我的眼晴。「地獄天使」的完成，是在一九三○年的十一月，過了六個月不到，公司又派我到各處去表演。當然，我登台的時候，是不能能永遠戴着一副黑眼鏡的。但是她還將黑眼鏡，一直戴到登台的時候，才取下來。等到一下塲她又立卽戴上了。但是她在台上的時候，是燈向上照着她的眼睛，眞是痛如針刺了。所以我每次登台下來，眼睛紅得像血一樣，淚水直流下來。於是我就急急上些止痛的藥，將眼晴閉住了休息，直到第二次登塲之時爲止。但是有的時候，東西奔波着，一天要登台五六次之多。還有許多地方官員，重要人物，亦不得不親自延見。眞是痛苦萬分了·」</p>
<p>不差的，眼睛所受的痛苦，可以說是人身各部各種毛痛，最難受的一種，凡是我們害過眼疾的，所以都曉得的。而因爲身體的毛病，影響到精神上的痛苦，亦算眼睛最厲害。琪恩哈羅的眼睛，在這過去三四年之中，無時無刻，不覺得她有完全眼瞎的危險。所以，她在神筋所受的是什麽樣的痛苦，亦就可想而知了。但是她一個勇敢的女子，她竟一些不告訴人，她亦不歸咎於什麽人。他說：「有許多時候，我眞想拿這件事告訴人。因爲許多朋友看見了我，老遠的就向我揮手，我一些都看不見。人家以爲我架子大。其實，我一些都不知道。我的眼睛，隨時都可以瞎掉，因爲那是人生最嬌嫩的部份，些小受些剌激，就會出大毛病的。那個時候，我的眼睛，好像坐了飛機在雲霧當中走着。一忽兒我可以看得很淸楚，一忽兒我的前面又模糊了。一模糊，或者一個鐘頭，或者好幾天，忽然又明亮起來了。我最害怕的時候，就是一張影片將拍完的時候，因爲我天天拍戲，眼光一天比一天壞。等到最後的幾天我差不多完全瞎了，但是工作却又不能停止。」</p>
<p>所以等到她最後，脫離了危險的時候，她的快樂亦就可想而知了。她說：「那種快活，是不可以言語形容的。你可以慢慢地設想好了。第一樣，我想到我將醫生的話，一次二次地告訴我母親的時候，她應當怎樣地歡欣。我知道她爲我而憂愁，比我自己還要厲害。那當然亦是琪恩受了極大的痛苦，而不肯說出來的緣故之一了。）我的母親常常呌我不要再拍戲了，不然的話，我的眼睛就要保不住了。但是我不聽她的話，一定要繼續下去。我知道倘使我眞的瞎了，我太對不起我的母親了。再則，我亦不敢在公司裏提到這件事，恐怕他們要强制地呌我停止工作。我又想到許多我高興做的事，而爲了眼睛的緣故，多少年不能做或少做。第一樣，現在我可以隨便請我買了許久，而還没有打開的書。第二樣，我可以儘量地看我所喜歡看的影片而不至於限於幾張我所必須看的影片了。總而言之，這好像是一個新生命的開始，是一個不受限制的生命的起頭。那是多末快活的一件事，你去設想去吧！」（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（再生緣）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Journal　of　A　Crime</p>
<p>—南京—</p>
<p>在新的觀點上來說，這一影片無論如何是舊型的作品。可是劇作者或作者却是十分電影藝術的地，將他們的舊觀念表現出來。</p>
<p>是的，這裏没有時代所需要的新内容，這裏祗舊觀念的藝術或對於人情世故的玩味。這種作品，我們無論在電影上，或是文學上都看過很多，在不同的程度之下，人們常感受着愉快或傷感。</p>
<p>在這裏，劇作者强調了女人們年老色衰的悲哀，當她們失却了丈夫的惜愛的時候，她們常是以整個生命來博取丈夫的愛情，於是芳淑（蘿絲蔡德頓飾）便拚了性命　殺了她的情敵。可是人總是有良心的——至少舊觀念的藝術家常抓住良心這一法寳，以光輝他們的作品，於是芳淑便在良心的譴責之下，她幾次的要去自首，雖然她的殺人死罪巳經有一好心腸而且豪俠的大盜，給她擔承　去了。</p>
<p>其後，劇作者到底不願使一己經充分博得人們之同情的殺人犯的女主角被處死刑，而且又要使她得着圓滿的結果，當她爲了愛情而受了許多折磨之後，於是再使她好良心的去救了一個小孩兒的生命，以致於自己受傷，到底她因神經受傷，完全忘却了自己的罪過，和她丈夫在上海濱安樂的度其下半世的生活。最後，當她丈夫小心的敎她認字的時候，她除了懂得山，海，太陽之外，還懂得愛情了。——從這些地方，我們來認取劇作者的觀念形態，乃是用不着再加旁的解釋的了。</p>
<p>毫無疑問的，這裏失去了愛情的傷感，悲哀，以至於憤怒，這裏良心譴責的心理描寫，都是高度電影手法的地，很成功的完成了内容所决定的成功。導演無論在那一段落中，無無是調子的，或者是氛圍的，都表現威廉凱勒（ＷilliamKeighley）圓熟的技巧。我們對於他，並不怎樣熟悉，可是在這裏確有值得驚異的奇才。自然，在這裏我們得說明劇作者或女主角的圓熟技術，十分有力的帮助了導演的成功。就劇本來說，例如他以囚犯向一不認識的女人（芳淑至牢中晤談）討香烟吃，以温度表來表現芳淑的疾病，……（他例不勝枚舉）都是很簡單的說明了故事，而且說明了周圍環境。蘿絲的心理表現，最顯明的是看見情敵的狗，與讀到大盜處死刑之消息的當時，以及殺人之後第一次和丈夫見面的時候，那優秀的演技，眞可謂無以復加。</p>
<p>很遺憾的，這一篇文章不能寫得更詳盡一點，其他從略。</p>

<p>金山是從話劇界轉到銀幕上的，以他過去演劇的天才，所以轉上銀幕的第一聲，便担任了月明公司的聲片「昏狂」的男主角，月明現正在蘇州拍外景，首次開拍的地點是金山浜，而且第一個鏡頭便是金山的戲，可謂巧極了。那一個鏡頭，是金山在馬上抱了他的情人吳玲私奔，其妹妹鄔麗珠在後保護，但對方敵人何非光領了人馬拚命追來，槍聲密如連珠，而金山一馬當先，絶塵而去，旁觀者莫不稱讚他的好身手。</p>

<h3>「神女」的前奏</h3>
<p>— 濃</p>
<p>受着人的玩弄，受着社會的藐視，在雙重的壓迫下，一個女子和生命爭鬥着。</p>
<p>在男子的懷抱裏，她是一個神女，齷齪得像泥土一樣，任人踐踏，但在另一塲合裏，她却是一個慈母，純潔得像聖母一樣，該受人的禮敬。</p>
<p>矛盾的生活，陷她於極度的痛苦。但是，社會却不了解她。她受盡了人間無情的唾駡，容忍了一切殘酷的侮辱，到最後還不能保全她唯一的愛子。</p>
<p>這是誰之過呢？</p>
<p>「神女」是這樣一個題材，在異軍突起的導演吳永剛手下處理着，以一個有思想有經騐的佈景老將加入了導演隊伍，即使是處女作，也會使人有絶對的信仰的。（却）</p>
<h3>車輪之演進卽日公映</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>奥期汀汽車廠製聲片</p>
<p>「車輪之演進」爲英國奥斯汀汽車廠，繼去年聲片「此種進步」而攝製之又一新片。其攝製之技巧，與内容之精彩，尤駕前片而上之。新片茲巳運抵此間，即將於本月九日上午十點半，假座卡爾登戲院公映，歡迎各界參觀，並不取費。新片内容分爲一，車輪之今昔觀。二，奥斯汀總廠槪况。三，風景片。四，汽車爬山一瞥。前述三項，合爲五卷。第四項則爲短片兩卷。並題名爲「世界之巓」。關於第一節，今昔車輪之不同，總以對比方法表現之，如以昔日視作重要運輸工具之驛車，與晚近長途旅行所用之機車相比較，後者敏捷而舒適，前者則御者昂然高坐，招搖過市，雖亦神氣十足，但一見其巓簸傾側之狀，殆可想知置身車上者，固無片刻安適之可言也。繼更以十九世紀之馬車，及裝有高烟囱之早期火車，與最近發明之「飛的蘇格蘭人」，及長距離電汽臥車，依次映出，兩相比較，速率逈殊。觀衆至此，當益覺科學之可貴，而亟須急起直追焉。關於第二節，總廠槪况，則奥斯汀汽車之一切鉅細部份，如何構造裝配，詳细靡遺。第三節風景片，對於英國各處鄉村景色，以及古代建築物等，一一收入鏡頭，觀衆恍如身歷其境，不禁悠然神往。至最後兩卷短片，爬山一瞥，則爲奥斯汀「七」，攀登那威最高峯之實地攝影，所有經過情形，宛然在目。山巓積雪等種種稀有景色，亦因而可以飽覽無餘焉。</p>

<h3>母女緣（Lad　yby　Choice）（五）</h3>
<p>— 仲嘉</p>
<p>亞拉班的妙目，四面一膘，她亦不覺暗暗吃了一驚。她一見潘茜，就認識了她。她一直地走到潘茜四面前問題：「我們不是在什麽地方會過的嗎？」潘茜微笑着，裝着一口的南方口音道：「我的親愛的那不見得吧。我一生都住在佛金尼亞的立治蒙城……不久之前，他們才請我到這裏來住住的」亞拉班聽了，不覺暗暗佩服這老太太表演的本領，並且想起那天她在半夜法庭裏咆哮的神氣，於是就不覺笑道：「那末你一定認識達理庭長的，是不是？」潘茜亦報之一笑，並且向她擠着眼，慢慢地說道：「讓我想想看……我認識的高貴的人很多…或者曾會見過的，亞拉班不覺高興得喊起來道：「好了，好了。你喜歡不喜歡跟我做我的媽媽？」</p>
<p>這樣她們就成交了。明天報紙上亦將這一叚新聞登出來了。莊尼密爾斯看見了這叚新聞，好似放心了，歎了一口氣，潘茜巳經得到了一個安身之處了。他於是望了下來，寫了一封信給潘茜向她道賀。他覺得他身上的責任輕了許多了。那一方面，並拉班自從將潘茜接到家之後，亦一天到晚快樂到很。她覺得潘茜，是個極知趣的人。她很高興替刕購置衣物等等，她覺得爲了潘茜給她的歡笑，那是很值得的。她和肯這爾商量好的原有的計劃，不過是藉此宣傳一下。但是現在肯道爾偶然提起了他們原有的計劃，而想呌亞拉班將潘茜打發走了時候，亞拉班竟狂怒起來。但是潘茜反勸着她道：「亞拉班，他的話没有說差。我本來是個街頭流浪者，我還是回到街頭去。你並且不用担心，我决不說一句話，說你們領我從養老堂出來，不過是一些宣傳作用，我知道你是個好人，我决不肯害你的。」亞拉班伸出手來和她拉着，她的聲音帶着悲切的音調說道：「我知道你是没有什麽怕懼的，但是我要你留在這裏。願上帝賜福於你的心，我實在從那天，你打那個賣戰的時候，我就眞心喜歡你了。」潘茜不相信似的問道：「眞的嗎………你要留我在這裏嗎？」亞拉班道：「自然是眞的，你放心好了。」潘茜不相信似的問題：「眞的嗎……你要留我在這裏嗎？」亞拉班道：「自然是眞的，你放心好了。」潘茜聽了，一時高興得啼哭起來。亞拉班拍着她的背膀，安慰她道：「快别哭了。我留你在這裏，是要呌你笑的，你怎麽哭起來了」於是她們就拿出酒來，慶祝她們的新合作。當潘茜舉起杯來的時候，她的眼睛裏又不覺含了一包眼淚，但是她却彎着嘴笑道：「恭祝你幸福美滿。你的一切行動，竟和我從前一般無二的。」亞拉班看着她，似乎不相信道：「恐怕我還及不到你哩。」</p>
<p>這樣她們二人之間的新友誼，是建築在尊敬，諒解上的，就是眞的母女，亦很難得會那樣相敬相愛。潘茜爲了深愛亞拉班的緣故，必定要保障她的一切利權。因此，她竟查出了她的經理肯道爾的許多弊端，以及欺騙亞拉班的地方。她就告訴了亞拉班，將肯道爾辭去了。自此以後，潘茜就開始替亞拉班計劃着，呌她脫離夜總會卑賤的生活，而做一個眞正的女伶。後來她又向莊呢密爾斯借了一些賭本，跑到她從前熟悉的地方去，贏了許多錢回來。她替亞拉班請了幾個名師，敎給她唱歌，戲劇，以及藝術的跳舞，都是潘茜自己拿出錢來的。但她不敢告訴她，錢是那裏來的。她祗說那是她一個表弟，死在澳洲了，留給她的，而亞拉班亦就不得不相信她了。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Interior Awaits Handover Quietly</h3>
<p>Two Vice Ministers Prepare to Resign</p>
<p>No Changes in the Political Readjustment Committee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) With the transfer of Interior Minister Huang Shao-xiong, Administrative Vice Minister Gan Naiguang and Permanent Vice Minister Fu Rulin have both requested to resign and intend to submit their resignations to the Executive Yuan. The ministry is now finalizing all documents and quietly awaiting the handover. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Qigong, Secretary-General of the Beiping Political Council, took a boat to Anqing on the 6th. Before his departure, he said that the issue of the Oriental Travel Agency continuing to operate the Beiping-Shenyang train service has not yet been decided. However, the internal reorganization of the travel agency will eventually be realized. The China Travel Service is largely expected to continue to be responsible, so there will be no major changes in general. The date when Committee Chairman Huang will assume office as Minister of the Interior in Nanjing has not yet been received. He said that his trip to Anqing today is purely a private matter and he will definitely return to Nanjing in four or five days. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Central Political Council resolved to appoint Huang Fu concurrently as Minister of the Interior, reporters visited Huang, but Huang was ill and could not see them. The reporter submitted four questions in writing: 1. Huang's illness, 2. Opinions on various policies, 3. Political views on the Minister of the Interior, 4. Recent political situation in North China, etc. Huang replied in writing, saying, "I am deeply grateful for everyone's concern about my illness. After treatment, I am gradually improving. The headache has subsided and the arm can gradually move. However, the blood pressure is still too low and needs to be recuperated for a short period. 2. The Central Government's recent telegrams of Wang and Chiang on various policies are practical and concise, and the whole country sympathizes with them. I have no other opinions. 3. I did not know beforehand that the Central Government had announced my concurrent position as Minister of the Interior. In recent years, it has been difficult to fulfill my duties in dealing with the situation in North China. Now that I have been given a heavy responsibility, the two capitals are far apart, and it may be difficult to take care of both issues at the same time. 4. The political affairs in North China are gradually being promoted, such as the establishment of a training institute for local administrative personnel and a training institute for rural guidance personnel, which are the implementation of basic plans for reorganizing political affairs and revitalizing rural areas, and are also the pioneers of all local construction." (Special dispatch on the 6th) (Beiping) Huang Fu, who had fallen ill due to overwork, has been receiving medical treatment in recent days and the results are good. He will recover in a few days. Wang and Chiang sent telegrams of condolence yesterday, and Huang replied with telegrams of thanks today. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Central Political Council announced that Zhu Peide would act as Chief of the General Staff, Tang Shengzhi would be the Director-General of Training, and Chen Tiaoyuan would be the President of the Military Advisory Council, the handover was being rushed everywhere. Zhu Peide summoned Zhou Yawei, Zhang Huafu, and various military supervisors on the 6th to instruct them on the duties of the Training Department. Tang Shengzhi also summoned Zhou Wei Yin, Zang Zhuo, and Zhang Yipeng, advisors of the Military Advisory Council, on the 6th to discuss the handover and ordered it to be completed by the end of the month. Chen Tiaoyuan is handling the closing of the Preparatory Army Headquarters in Jiangxi and will return to Nanjing in two weeks. It is said that the new personnel will take office on New Year's Day next year. This time, there will be very few changes in the affairs of the various departments and offices of the administrative organs due to the transfer of officials. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Central News Agency reporter published the news that Huang Fu would concurrently serve as Minister of the Interior, there was much speculation outside about the candidates to succeed him in the Beiping Political Readjustment Committee. The reporter specifically visited a responsible person of the Central Government. According to the responsible person, the Central Committee's appointment of Committee Chairman Huang concurrently as Minister of the Interior was to increase Huang's powers and make it easier for him to reorganize political affairs in Beiping, just like the example of Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin concurrently serving as Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch. If things are complicated, he may not have to stay in Nanjing permanently, and the Political Readjustment Committee does not need to be replaced. Once the political affairs in the North are reorganized, the agency can be changed or abolished at that time, and there is no need to find a successor. The words spoken outside are not true.

The War Zone Cleanup Committee and the Japanese side are still waiting to continue negotiations on the deployment of the newly formed Special Police Force of the War Zone to the east.

<p>(Hankou) The provincial government, in accordance with the order of the headquarters, is planning for the pacification of border areas and has ordered various departments to jointly draft measures for approval. It is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 15th to discuss and telegraph Liu Fu and Wang Huai, two commissioners, to prepare a plan for the reform of the border areas and bring it to the provincial meeting for discussion. The Hubei and Jiangxi provincial governments are following Chiang's orders to plan the construction of the Hubei-Jiangxi connecting highway, which will start from Yangxin to Jiujiang immediately. The Hubei-Henan-Shaanxi connecting highway has been largely completed, and Xiangyang, Nanyang, and Baihe are all open to traffic. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Ordered to Crack Down on Local Tyrants</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The headquarters ordered the provincial government, saying that the banditry in the province has just been suppressed, and the local vitality has been greatly damaged. The people are waiting for relief. Local tyrants are running rampant in the villages and should be severely punished in accordance with the law to pacify the people. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Request for Deferral of Implementation of Household Registration Law Denied</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Household Registration Law will be implemented on July 1 this year. Some provinces have reported difficulties due to the already established Baojia system and requested the Central Government to temporarily implement the Household Registration Law. The Ministry of the Interior reviewed and decided that the compilation and investigation of Baojia households is to complete self-defense, while the registration of household registration and personnel stipulated by the Household Registration Law is to determine the people's nationality and status. The nature of the two is different and can be carried out in parallel. Moreover, in counties where the Baojia system has been established, the Baojia temporarily replaces the neighborhood, and the original Township and Town offices still exist. In counties where the Baojia system has not been established, they must be organized to remain complete. Therefore, the implementation of household registration and personnel registration items in accordance with the law does not cause difficulties due to the promotion of the Baojia system and should proceed as scheduled to comply with the regulations. The Executive Yuan also believes that there is no need to postpone the implementation and issued instructions to the provinces to follow on the 6th. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Standing Committee of the Anti-Opium Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Opium Committee held a standing committee meeting on the 6th to discuss: 1. The issue of the Customs specially stipulating regulations for the import of caffeine and acetic anhydride. It was resolved to send personnel to consult with the Ministry of Finance. 2. The Nanchang Headquarters has formulated a special inspection method with the various railway bureaus and the Anti-Opium Inspectorate to check for drugs, which conflicts with the method formulated by the Ministry of Railways for inspection outside the station. The result was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Arrests of Drug Dealers in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The military and political authorities in Xuzhou have recently been vigorously enforcing anti-drug laws and regulations. The Public Security Bureau has made large-scale arrests of drug addicts. Two hundred people were captured in January. The counties in Xuzhou are also doing their best to search and arrest them and are sending them to Xuzhou for strict punishment. The Xuzhou Security Headquarters has executed five or six drug traffickers in the past ten days. On the morning of the 6th, Zhang Hongxun, a drug dealer from Xiao County, was also executed. People in society believe that heroin is the most harmful and express their strong sympathy for this anti-drug movement. Recently, the drug trend has been slightly reduced, but official opium sales are therefore being carried out openly. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Mill Association Petitions for Exemption from Cotton Yarn Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese Cotton Mill Association continued to send representatives Nie Lusheng, Dong Zhongsheng, Jiang Shangda, Liu Jingji, Rong Desheng, Xue Mingjian, and Zhang Zemin on the 6th to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry to state their difficulties and petition for no further tax increases. They stated that countries around the world such as Britain, the United States, and Japan do not levy taxes on cotton yarn. Even the Premier's instructions are to strengthen the protection of essential goods for people's lives, such as clothing, food, and housing. In the Qing Dynasty, cotton yarn was only taxed at one yuan and several jiao. Since the unified tax was changed, it has increased to 8 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen and 11 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen per piece, making it difficult to bear. They hope to reduce it. However, there are rumors of further tax increases, and manufacturers are unable to bear it. The authorities believe that cement and cigarette taxes have already been increased, and cotton yarn cannot be an exception. Cigarettes are luxury goods, and the tax should be heavy, as is the case in all countries. Cement is an essential building material, and cotton yarn is an essential item of clothing for people's lives. In recent months, raw cotton has been rising, but cotton cloth has not improved. Cotton mills are struggling to survive and cannot bear any more burdens. If the tax increase is intended to increase national income, then the cotton import tax rate was increased in July of this year, but tax revenue has decreased compared to previous years, which is insufficient. Simply increasing the tax rate is not a good way to increase taxes. Some say that the tax increase is the same for both Chinese and foreign cotton mills. Why can foreign merchants bear it, but Chinese merchants cannot? However, in reality, a large part of the yarn of foreign merchants used to be shipped to the South Seas Islands, South America, India, and other places where it was tax-free. Recently, most of it is sold in the East, and it is given various protections. In our country's customs duties, it can also get a tax refund. Therefore, although it is nominally the same for both Chinese and foreign merchants, foreign merchants have never been taxed, but the tax is levied on Chinese merchants. Because Chinese merchants' yarn is completely sold domestically and cannot obtain the right to a tax refund. Other issues, such as higher interest rates than foreign factories and the lack of mechanical technology compared to foreign merchants, are waiting for the government and cotton merchants to urgently seek improvements. How can they bear any more burdens, leading to their death? The purpose of this petition is to temporarily maintain the status quo in order to alleviate the hardship. The relevant authorities have expressed their understanding. We took the train back to Shanghai that day to report to our colleagues. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Scheduled to Move into New Building</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications has decided to start moving into its new building on the 14th and is scheduled to complete the move within a week. The allocation of the new building has also been arranged: the Postal and Telecommunications Departments are on the third floor, the ministerial secretaries, counselors, and various committee offices are on the second floor, and the General Affairs Postal Administration is on the lower level. It is heard that the General Postal Administration will not be able to move to Beijing until next year. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan's Commercial Law Committee Reviews Draft Insurance Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Commercial Law Committee met on the morning of the 6th to review the draft Insurance Law. Ma Yinchu chaired the meeting.

As a result, the draft Insurance Law will incorporate the opinions stated by the representatives and will be revised again. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Address on the Opening Day of the National Vocational Education Conference</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the opening of this vocational and labor creation exhibition, the Ministry of Education convened the National Vocational Education Conference in the capital, which has attracted considerable attention from the nation. The conference is scheduled to begin today and close the day after tomorrow. Participants include vocational education experts and representatives from various institutions. The discussions will cover various issues related to vocational education administration and organization, as well as methods for promoting vocational education, implementing vocational guidance, and training vocational teachers. During the conference, the Vocational Education Design Committee of the Ministry of Education will also convene to discuss major plans.</p>
<p>Since the Second National Conference passed the "Determining the Trend of Educational Facilities Proposal" submitted by the National Government, the advocacy of vocational education has suddenly become lively again, far exceeding the situation in the eighth and ninth years of the Republic. Speaking only from the perspective of the Ministry of Education, there are detailed regulations for vocational schools and procedures for provinces and cities to promote vocational education, and teaching material outlines, curricula, and equipment summaries for various subjects in vocational schools have been promulgated. There are also outlines for the registration and training of vocational school teachers in various provinces and cities, and the proportion of vocational education in secondary school funding has been determined. In addition, sending commissioners to various provinces for on-site inspections and organizing vocational education design committees have also achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>However, the promotion of a cause requires not only a central driving force but also consideration of the surrounding environment and reliance on multi-faceted cooperation to achieve significant results. The most important key lies in grasping the fundamental direction. We cannot fail to recognize that the current social landscape is still filled with feudal ideas. The middle and upper classes mostly believe in the traditional concept of "orthodox background" and are unwilling to easily allow their children to study vocational skills or engage in practical production. Moreover, after graduating from six years of primary school or junior high school, most children prefer to continue their education unless their families are in financial difficulties, and they are unwilling to participate in low-level production work. As for general shops and factories, they adhere to old ways and do not seek improvement, preferring to maintain the old-fashioned apprenticeship system and not valuing new-style vocational education at all. The future of vocational education faces various obstacles, which is already dangerous, not to mention the lack of teachers, the simplicity of equipment, and the difficulty in finding employment for graduates. Therefore, while the government is enthusiastically promoting it, some people are worried and anxious, believing that the second total collapse of vocational education is not far away.</p>
<p>We also feel that in the past ten years or so, discussions on this issue have mostly focused on minor details and rarely grasped the fundamental direction. Originally, there are two views on vocational education. One is to regard occupation as the goal and education as the tool. The initial motivation for promoting vocational education in Europe and the United States was to use education as a tool for developing or obtaining an occupation. As a result, the content of vocational education is inevitably narrowed, causing it to lose its social nature. The other view is much more insightful. It believes that vocational education has two values. On the one hand, it uses education to prepare individuals for occupations, enabling people to find their place. On the other hand, it provides opportunities for education through occupations, making education richer and more meaningful. The former value emphasizes the occupation aspect, while the latter emphasizes the education aspect. Both should be considered simultaneously and should not be neglected. Otherwise, if those who run vocational education only want to use education as a tool to solve occupations, or use educational theories to create occupations, without knowing how to implement education in established occupations or study educational facilities in established production institutions, how can it not become school-style vocational education? Students trained by this kind of vocational education are only fit to be scholarly craftsmen, so how can they talk about direct production?</p>
<p>To obtain the first value mentioned above, it is necessary to pay attention to vocational guidance, ensuring that the special talents of the guided can be adapted to their social service. To obtain the second value, education must be integrated into the production environment. Training occupations in production is the truly direct vocational training. The purpose of "learning what is useful, using what is learned, work assisting learning, learning assisting work" can be naturally achieved. We dare to contribute this opinion on the opening day of the National Vocational Education Conference.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Prepares for Second Formation Flight</h3>
<p>Shipbuilding Program Intensified</p>
<p>(Washington) While dozens of naval aircraft and more than a dozen warships are searching for the two Australian aviators in the waters off Hawaii, Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced that the Navy Air Corps' long-distance flight to Hawaii or the Philippines will still take place. He stated that this long-distance flight across the Pacific Ocean is related to the naval exercise to be held near the Aleutian Islands next summer and is therefore imperative. Although there are no concrete plans for this, the Navy Air Corps may conduct round-trip flights between the mainland and Alaska to the Hawaiian Islands as part of the naval exercise to be held near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska in July and August next year. After the fleet completes its exercise near Alaska, it may be preceded by naval aircraft and quickly head to Hawaii. Swanson stated that after the Navy Air Corps successfully flew from the mainland to Pearl Harbor last spring, the Navy Department began to consider this long-distance flight plan. Liaison flights between the U.S. mainland, Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, and other U.S. territories are necessary and proper exercises. The success of the formation flight last spring proves that naval aviators and naval aircraft are capable of this long-distance flight. Regarding general naval preparations, Swanson stated that the Navy Department has no intention of changing its plan to bring naval strength to the limits permitted by the treaty by 1942. Mr. Swanson further stated that naval experts, in view of Japan's possible abandonment of the treaty, are now considering ways to accelerate shipbuilding when necessary.

<h3>U.S. Reaffirms Maintaining Current Naval Ratio</h3>
<p>Equality in Armaments Does Not Guarantee Equality in Security</p>
<p>Advocates for Sincere and Universal Reduction by the Three Nations</p>
<p>(London) When U.S. Chief Delegate Davis first announced the U.S. naval position today, he reaffirmed the U.S. government's advocacy of maintaining the naval balance of power stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty. Mr. Davis stated that the alternative based on equality in armaments will not achieve equality in security. The United States agrees to gradual reductions. He has proposed, under the instruction of President Roosevelt, a sincere and universal reduction in naval armaments, which can be implemented without changing the comparative strength stipulated in the naval treaty and without endangering the security of participating countries. Because no compromise has been reached on the reduction, he has stated that we are still prepared to abide by the Washington Naval Treaty and continue the London Naval Treaty, with only minor modifications as required by the environment, in order to gain the enthusiastic support of the signatory countries. Mr. Davis also stated that once the principles in the 1922 treaty are abandoned, it will inevitably lead to instability, international suspicion, and wasteful competition, and no country will obtain true benefits. According to a Reuters correspondent in Washington, Americans view Davis's published remarks as a responsible expression of the U.S. government's views. This is the first official interpretation of the U.S. goals. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have not commented on this issue. Anyone who inquires is directed to Davis for answers. Although the United States' proposal for sincere and universal disarmament has never been formally announced, Secretary of the Navy Swanson has revealed that if Britain and Japan do the same, the United States may agree to reduce its navy by 20 percent or even higher.

<h3>British-Japanese Talks Unfruitful</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon and Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira held talks again this morning at the Foreign Office. The content of the talks concerned the situation created after the Washington Treaty was soon to be declared abolished, and various solutions, such as whether the naval negotiations should be suspended or continued, and whether to convene a 1935 naval conference. It is generally believed that the talks did not result in any decisions. (Havas Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>It's Too Early to Talk About Adjournment</h3>
<p>(Washington) News from London says that once Japan announces the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States will withdraw from the naval talks. Secretary of State Hull declared today that this news is premature, and that the U.S. naval delegation still hopes to establish an agreement to limit naval armaments. Since the talks are still ongoing and Japan has not formally expressed its intention to declare the abolition of the treaty, the U.S. naval delegation is still staying in London. (Havas Telegram on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Refusal to Abolish Treaty is Fully Justified</h3>
<p>Washington Treaties are Interrelated</p>
<p>Japan's Actions are Enemies of Peace</p>
<p>Rome The Labor Newspaper of the Fascist Party published an article explaining why Italy refused to simultaneously declare the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty with Japan. The article stated that Italy sees no reason to jointly declare the abolition of the treaty with Japan. Italy's ambition is to make its naval armaments equal to the most powerful country in Europe (referring to France). The Washington Naval Treaty stipulates that the tonnage of battleships and aircraft carriers for Italy and France is the same, so Italy's wish has already been partially realized. This is one of the reasons why Italy does not agree to abolish the treaty. Not only that, the Washington Naval Treaty is part of the entire series of treaties signed at the Washington Conference. (Note: Three treaties were concluded at the Washington Conference in 1921-22: one is the Naval Treaty with 24 articles, one is the Nine-Power Treaty with 9 articles, and one is the Four-Power Agreement with 4 articles. The latter was signed by Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, and its main purpose is to maintain general peace and maintain and respect the rights of each country in the Pacific region to all island territories, replacing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of July 13, 1911.) No matter what Japan says, the Naval Treaty, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Four-Power Agreement are interrelated and inseparable. If one is declared abolished, it is tantamount to declaring the abolition of the others. Therefore, from a constructive point of view, after the Washington Naval Treaty is declared abolished, the countries concerned must conclude a new agreement to replace it. Japan's unilateral action (referring to declaring the abolition of the treaty) is already enough to cause disputes. Moreover, although Italy is a great power, it is not as concerned about Pacific events as Britain and the United States. If Italy participates in Japan's actions, the result will only make international relations more chaotic. Italy's reasons for refusal are sufficient, as can be seen from this."

<h3>Germany Observes Progress of London Negotiations</h3>
<p>Japan's Demand for Equality Indicates Ambitious Goals</p>
<p>Germany Cannot Remain Indifferent to Arms Expansion by Various Countries</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official Political Foreign Correspondence Newspaper published an article commenting on Japan's imminent declaration of the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, stating that Germany's comments on the London naval talks are based on its position as an "objective observer." "Japan's naval demands are not only for unrestricted equality of rights, as Germany demands for arms issues, but also for its naval armaments to be equal to other countries in terms of quantity. Japan's argument is based on its island nation status and the political situation in the Far East. However, the United States has always believed that this argument is not sufficient." The newspaper concluded, "Once the issue of the ratio of naval forces in European countries becomes acute, Germany cannot ignore it and remain indifferent." (Havas Telegram on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Far East Policy Cannot Hesitate</h3>
<p>Lord Lothian Worries About World Crisis</p>
<p>Scrapping of Naval Treaty Will Affect Europe</p>
<p>Hopes the United States Will Join Collective Peace System</p>
<p>(London) Lord Lothian declared in the House of Lords today, "We are now gradually reaching the most critical stage in world history. The most far-reaching consequences depend on the policies that the British government will implement in the Far East in the next three to six months. There is no doubt that one of the signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty intends to announce the abolition of the treaty before the end of this year. If Britain upholds the principles of the treaty, the United States will definitely be our backer. However, we want to know to what extent the United States will maintain these principles. Russia and China can also be our supporters. China looks to Britain for help more than any other country. As for the other signatory countries, they can also unite and give their support from afar. If diplomatic power cannot succeed in the Far East and one country can tear up treaties, who knows if another country will tear up the Treaty of Versailles in the future? If so, the world will have another great war. But if we can uphold the neutrality of the Pacific, we can break down the biggest obstacle to the collective system, which is the United States' failure to join this system." Undersecretary of State Stanhope replied on behalf of the government, "We do not want to discuss the Far East issue now. The talks between the three major powers are currently underway. If we discuss this issue now, it will harm the collective peace system." (Reuters Telegram on the 5th)</p>
<h3>British Naval Veteran Advocates Maintaining Maritime Supremacy</h3>
<p>Free Construction of Cruisers</p>
<p>National Defense Ensures Security</p>
<p>British Navy to Undergo Major Expansion</p>
<p>(London) Lord Beatty, former Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy during the European War, delivered a speech at Queen's Hall tonight, expressing his regret again for the lack of British cruisers, saying, "What I am worried about is not the naval equality that Japan is demanding, because if the Japanese need equality, they must pay a considerable price for it. What I am worried about is that Britain must have seventy cruisers to be sufficient. Now, the task of seventy ships is being entrusted to fifty ships (the limit allowed by the London Naval Treaty). This is a serious mistake. I dare to tell you that if the naval conference can be convened next year, this error should be remedied at the conference so that Britain will not accept restrictions again and endanger its own security. In other words, we should freely build cruisers to match the special responsibilities we bear. This is possible. Some say that building warships costs a lot, and the British Navy Department must consider whether it has the financial resources. The answer is that other countries spend more on their navies than Britain, especially the United States. Why should our country not have these financial resources? Maintaining naval strength is of great importance to the British Empire. The government must be aware of this, and we must also fulfill our responsibilities. Once maritime hegemony is lost, there is no hope of recovery. History is full of precedents. We must be careful." (Havas Telegram on the 5th) (London) The Daily Telegraph reported that the number of British naval soldiers and officers will be greatly expanded, and the budget for next year will take this into account. The newspaper continued that although the British Navy occupies an important position in the world, it is not as good as other countries' navies in terms of personnel numbers, so there is a need to increase it. This move has nothing to do with the results of the naval talks. (Havas Telegram on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Saito Promotes in the United States</h3>
<p>Boston Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito stated at a banquet of the Japan Society today that Japan is prepared to reduce its navy by half, but only if Britain and the United States follow suit. After the Washington Naval Treaty is abolished, Japan does not want an era not governed by treaties, but hopes for a more reasonable international agreement. Japan will not make a challenge to compete in building warships, but hopes for an active reduction in naval armaments. Someone expressed the opinion that for every three ships Japan builds, Britain and the United States will build five. He heard this saying and found it very strange. (Reuters Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Recruits Red Army</h3>
<p>Peasants and Workers Eagerly Enlist</p>
<p>TASS Moscow, November 3 The Soviet Red Army is recruiting young people born in 1912 this year. This recruitment work is now actively underway. The majority of recruits are shock workers from factories and collective farms. Recruits in the Moscow region are all literate. Most of them have passed shooting and "Ready for Labor and Defense" badge examinations. The day of conscription each year is like a holiday. Strong young people are recruited into the army. Their joy is like entering school. The general public is extremely concerned about the recruits. Their comrades often line up to send them to the registration office. Factory managers, collective farm managers, and local Soviet chairmen often accompany them. Families also eagerly hope for their conscription, because their joining the Red Army has no hindrance to their families. (Since the phenomenon of unemployment has been eliminated, their old mothers and others have no worries about no one taking care of them when their children enlist.) One day, the workers of the Baku Himitto Factory gathered in the room of shock worker Kagramanov. Mr. Kagramanov said to them, "Today, the elder and second sons of my family are joining the Red Army. They are doing very well in their studies and are both shock workers in the factory. I hope they will become shock soldiers in the Red Army and outstanding defenders of our great motherland." The streets and squares near the recruitment office are decorated with flags, slogans, etc. Government commissioners, senior Red Army officers, Soviet heroes, famous artists, and writers often visit these recruitment offices. They sometimes give speeches or perform in front of the public. The development of Soviet industry has greatly changed the social composition of the Red Army. 45 percent of the Red Army soldiers are now industrial workers, and 42.5 percent are peasants (70 percent of whom are collective farmers). About half of the Red Army members are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members.</p>
<h3>France Consolidates Border Defense</h3>
<p>Requires Special Fee of 800 Million Francs</p>
<p>(Paris) The government has formulated a border defense armament plan and requested a special appropriation of 800,000,000 francs. The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today passed it by a vote of twelve to one. This appropriation is not included in the Army Department's budget. The allocation is as follows: (1) Artillery and other military equipment 615,500,000 francs; (2) Engineering Corps 48,000,000 francs; (3) Military supplies 35,000,000 francs; (4) Health affairs 15,000,000 francs; (5) Gunpowder 80,000,000 francs; (6) Railways 6,500,000 francs.

<p>Proposed 180 Million Relief Fund</p>
<p>Japanese Government Finds it Difficult to Bear</p>
<p>Determined to Use Dissolution of Parliament as Leverage</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The questioning at the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives continued until late at night. After Koiso Shiro finished his questioning, the Seiyukai suddenly proposed an emergency motion, stating that the government, in view of the principle of balancing national defense and industry, should add 180 million yuan to the ninth-year supplementary budget and the tenth-year budget currently under deliberation, and submit it to the Sixty-Seventh Parliament. The Budget Committee should also temporarily rest to await the government's clear answer. The atmosphere in the venue immediately became tense and abnormal. There were various discussions on this motion. The venue was adjourned amidst chaos at 11:00. Government authorities immediately convened a temporary cabinet meeting to consider countermeasures, but no results were obtained. After twenty minutes, the cabinet meeting ended, and the Budget Committee did not continue due to the lateness of the hour. (Japan United Press Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's emergency motion directly conflicts with the government, and the parliament encounters a major reef. The Seiyukai's motion clearly indicates that the increase in the budget is 180 million yuan. The government cannot answer this with words such as "consideration" or "appropriate handling." If the government does not give a clear answer, the Budget Committee will be in a state of stagnation. However, the government can never admit the Seiyukai's reckless demands. The budget submitted by the government to the temporary parliament was carefully compiled with serious responsibility, taking into account the current financial situation and various internal and external circumstances. Therefore, the Seiyukai's motion can be regarded as a vote of no confidence in the government. The government should only take the path of dissolution. (Japan United Press Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's emergency cabinet meeting opened at 9:00 a.m., consistently opposing the Seiyukai's claims, and decided to dissolve the parliament. It adjourned at 10:20 a.m. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 8:00 p.m. tonight, the government convened a temporary cabinet meeting in the Diet building to discuss the attitude towards the Seiyukai. It lasted for half an hour before ending. At 8:36 p.m., the House of Representatives reopened its plenary session, but the government's attitude remained tough. (Dentsu Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(East) During the deliberation of the budget in the Budget Committee, the Seiyukai, at 10:00 p.m., gathered inside the Diet building by Kuwara, Shimada, Wakamia, Horikiri, Yamaguchi, Ando, and Higashi Okada, and other executives, and as a result of confidential discussions, decided to propose an emergency motion for an additional disaster budget of 180 million yuan, which was proposed by Mr. Higashi Takeshi. Thus, it aroused a head-on conflict between the Seiyukai and the government. If the government opposes it, nine out of ten of the parliament will be dissolved. If dissolved, the general election will be held on January 5 next year. (Dentsu Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Tense Atmosphere in Parliament</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai's bomb-like motion caused a direct confrontation between the government and the Seiyukai, reaching a situation where the parliament is bound to be dissolved. This morning, the government convened an emergency meeting, and the Seiyukai and Minseito parties held talks, and each faction held separate meetings to discuss countermeasures. The atmosphere in the parliament is very tense. The Budget Committee convened a meeting at 10:00 a.m. this morning and carefully discussed the results, and decided to continue the Budget Committee meeting at 1:00 p.m. today. (Japan United Press Telegram on the 6th) (Tokyo) The Budget Committee meeting did not open until 2:18 p.m. Okada Prime Minister opened up on the government's beliefs regarding the Seiyukai's emergency motion, saying that the government has given deep consideration to relief efforts in disaster areas and will continue to implement necessary facilities to relieve disaster areas. The ninth-year supplementary budget currently under deliberation is an emergency necessary budget, and he hopes that everyone will proceed with deliberation as soon as possible. Then he immediately announced a recess, and each party held separate meetings to decide on its own attitude. (Japan United Press Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the discussions at the Budget Committee meeting, it was decided to hold a meeting from 10:00 a.m. on the 7th and to end the questioning in the morning, and after the resolution at the plenary session in the afternoon, it would be immediately sent to the House of Peers. However, the current atmosphere is extremely dangerous, and it is still doubtful whether it can proceed according to the scheduled procedure. (Japan United Press Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Military Also Advocates Dissolution</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the Seiyukai's motion, the progress of parliamentary affairs has fallen into difficulty. The military believes that the Seiyukai's move is a reckless act with the intention of deliberately delaying parliamentary affairs and is too self-centered in party tactics. Judging from the nature of the temporary parliament, it is doubtful whether the Seiyukai has the conscience of the people. The slogan of party rejuvenation will inevitably have an opposing impact on the people. Although the brain department is currently silent, the general public in the department is looking forward to the dissolution from the perspective of the country and to give the political parties an opportunity to reflect. (Dentsu Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Takahashi's Firm Stance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 9:30 this morning, the government convened an emergency cabinet meeting, attended by all cabinet members, all appearing tense. As Prime Minister Okada was contemplating measures the government should take regarding the Seiyukai's proposals, Finance Minister Takahashi expressed a strong opinion, stating that the government had already included the amount of effort to relieve the disaster in the budget. Therefore, the 180 million yen demanded by the Seiyukai was even more of a fantasy. Thus, the government should exercise the powers vested in it. The ministers Tokonami, Goto, and Machida all agreed, and the decision was made to implement the dissolution of the parliament. Therefore, Prime Minister Okada rejected the Seiyukai's motion in the budget committee. If the Seiyukai does not change its position, it will definitely dissolve the parliament mid-session. (6th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<h3>Internal Changes in the Seiyukai</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Upon receiving the news that the government had decided in a cabinet meeting to resolutely reject the Seiyukai's demands, and would resort to the drastic measure of dissolution if the Seiyukai maintained its opposition, the Seiyukai was shocked. The hard-line and soft-line factions became adversaries. There were expressions of dissatisfaction with Chairman Suzuki regarding the motion against the leadership. Internal disputes reached an extreme. Therefore, the budget committee meeting, scheduled to convene at 1:00 PM, was delayed until 5:00 PM because the Seiyukai party’s decision had not been made. The Seiyukai will decide its attitude at that time to respond to the government's rejection of the motion. However, there are already signs of softening within the Seiyukai. The government has decided that no matter what, if the Seiyukai's attitude remains strong, it will immediately request the dissolution of the Diet. However, the Seiyukai is inclined towards a compromise. Whether or not to dissolve will be decided at the 5:00 PM budget committee meeting. (6th, Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<h3>Opposition from the Minseito</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When the Seiyukai proposed stopping discussion at the budget committee meeting on the 5th, the Minseito expressed opposition, believing that such actions by the Seiyukai violated trust. There is now a very high tide of voices advocating for the cancellation of the coalition between the Minseito and Seiyukai. On the 6th, they planned to gather within the Diet to discuss everything, and therefore refused to attend the joint committee. (6th, Japan United News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. To or Higashi, on behalf of the Seiyukai, suddenly submitted an emergency motion on the evening of the 5th, greatly surprising the government, the Minseito, and other parties. The Minseito opposed the motion, but because the Seiyukai had a larger number of members, the motion passed. After the meeting adjourned, the Minseito issued a statement saying that although the government's proposed budget was insufficient, relief for disaster areas was urgent. The Minseito intended to first support the government's proposal and then demand careful consideration. However, the Seiyukai's motion, under the guise of adjourning the meeting, prevented deliberation from proceeding, and our party absolutely opposed the Seiyukai's motion. Government cabinet members were flustered and excited, expressing various opinions at an emergency cabinet meeting. However, because Finance Minister Takahashi did not attend, an attitude could not be decided. (6th, Japan United News Agency)</p>
<h3>Organizing International Troops to Maintain Order During the Saar Plebiscite</h3>
<p>The French Foreign Minister's Proposal Endorsed by Britain and Italy</p>
<p>The League of Nations Passes the Saar Report</p>
<p>(Geneva) The proposal made by French Foreign Minister Laval to maintain order in the Saar region with international troops has been endorsed today by the League of Nations representatives of Britain and Italy. British Lord Privy Seal Eden and Italian representative Baron Aloisi both announced that they were prepared to send troops to the Saar next year during the plebiscite to maintain order and protect Saar residents from retaliation. The League of Nations Council will reconvene at 6:30 PM today. The Council has officially filed the French Foreign Minister's plan and requested the Saar Commission to report in detail on its feasibility before the end of this session. As for preventing Saar residents from retaliation after the vote, the foreign ministers of both Germany and France have declared guarantees. (5th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council unanimously passed the Saar report today. Beforehand, French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov declared that if the plebiscite held on January 13 next year results in the Saar people wanting to maintain the status quo, then the Saar residents can vote again on whether or not to merge with Germany. As for Laval's proposal to maintain order in the Saar with international troops, it has been endorsed by Britain and Poland. (6th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting, the League of Nations Council unanimously passed the Saar Three-Person Committee's report on handling difficulties in the plebiscite. Each member of the Council shook hands with and congratulated Aloisi, the chairman of the Three-Person Committee, and others. British representative Eden stated that the agreement reached in Rome a few days ago was a good omen for relations between France and Germany, as well as among Western European countries. Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Piniès stated that this agreement has eased tensions between the countries involved.</p>
<p>It is widely expected that after the Council passes this report, the British Parliament of the Saar Committee will immediately proceed with the plan to organize international police to maintain order during the plebiscite. According to general opinion, about 1,500 to 2,000 police officers would be sufficient, to be organized from soldiers selected from the British, Belgian, and Italian armies. It is said that the Netherlands has also been asked to participate, and it is likely that the Netherlands will agree. Although there are rumors that a country in the Scandinavian Peninsula will also be asked to participate, it is widely believed that this police force will be composed of people from the above three or four countries. The moral authority of this army is very important. This will be the second international army organized under the authority of the League of Nations. The first international army previously handled the dispute between Colombia and Peru in South America. The Three-Person Committee's report mentions several important events. As for the question of how to define the situation established under the Treaty of Versailles, it is also discussed in the report. What is now clear on this point is that the League of Nations has the right to order a second plebiscite if necessary. The General Assembly report advocates that if the status quo remains unchanged, residents can acquire Saar citizenship, but Saar people of German ethnicity can freely change their citizenship to German. The report states that Saar residents without voting rights also have the same protections as voters. The documents exchanged between the foreign ministers of France and Germany, proving this guarantee, are also attached to the report. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Conditions for Participation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Britain has decided to participate in the international action to maintain order in the Saar during the plebiscite, but on the condition that France and Germany approve this resolution. The above news was announced today by British Lord Privy Seal Eden at the League of Nations Council meeting. The public paid great attention to this news, as this decision by Britain contributes more to peace than any other action. Eden stated that while both sides have great goodwill, he acknowledged that there may inevitably be some incitement and disturbances during and around the time of the vote. Rather than remedying the situation afterwards, it is better to prevent it beforehand. Before Eden spoke, French Foreign Minister Laval stated that to show that France has no ulterior motives, France does not want to participate in the organization of the international police force, but asks the League of Nations to be responsible for maintaining order. This proposal by France is on the condition that Germany also does not participate in the international police force. Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov said that he must consult with Moscow before deciding whether or not to participate. The British and German governments have formally welcomed Britain's proposal to maintain order during the Saar plebiscite, considering it a great contribution to European peace. At the same time, the League of Nations Saar Three-Person Committee is currently considering the issue of the international police force, feeling that this matter should not be borne by Britain alone. Therefore, it is planned that Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg will jointly organize the police force. The League of Nations generally expects a tense period after the plebiscite. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Exploring Germany's Stance</h3>
<p>(Geneva, Saar District)</p>
<p>Aloisi, the chairman of the Three-Person Committee, visited German Consul General Krall in Geneva, asking Krall to prove the German government's stance on the entry of international police into the Saar. (5th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to German sources here, Germany will not accept the proposal to send international troops to maintain order in the Saar, at least until it has been discussed. (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, it was learned that the Council was holding a meeting to discuss the Saar plebiscite, at which French Foreign Minister Laval requested the organization of international troops to be sent to the Saar region to maintain order, but for the sake of impartiality, the French were willing to abstain from participating in this army. According to informed German sources, it is believed that Germany will not oppose the dispatch of an international police force when necessary to maintain order in the Saar. Although Germany still believes that there is no reason to dispatch special troops, because France is willing to abstain from participating in this international army, Germany considers it a generous act and is quite satisfied. Regarding the composition of this international army, Germany has raised some reservations, arguing that only neutral countries should participate, and that countries related to either the French or German parties should not participate. Germany considers the Czech Republic, Belgium, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union to have closer ties with France and should not participate. From France's perspective, it may also be believed that the Free City of Danzig and Austria are less qualified to participate in this international army. (6th, Havas)</p>
<h3>The Three-Person Committee's Report on the Saar Question</h3>
<p>The Content is Divided into Two Major Parts</p>
<p>Both Politics and Economics are Discussed</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Saar Three-Person Committee submitted a report to the League of Nations, divided into two major parts. The first part details key points, such as the interpretation and scope of the agreement, the nationality and options of residents, the extension of protections to the non-electorate, the treatment of residents after the establishment of a new situation, social security, and the status of Saar officials. The second part pertains to financial and coal mine issues. The report also includes correspondence between the Three-Person Committee and the French and German governments, the rights that the Saar people should receive after merging with Germany in the future, and the agreements between Germany and France on financial issues. The report first explains the current situation, largely as presented in the July 31, 1934, memorandum of Barthou. The report states that, according to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, if the results of the popular vote favor maintaining the status quo, the League of Nations will not continue to be the guardian of the Saar region, but the League of Nations will exercise its governing power and try to safeguard the interests of the residents and create a permanent situation. The report strictly adheres to the provisions of the peace treaty, so there is no indication of a second vote. Regarding nationality, Saar residents of German nationality will acquire Saar nationality after voting, but may choose to be German nationals. People of non-German nationality will maintain their original nationality, but may choose to be Saar nationals. For the non-electorate, both the German and French governments assume the same obligations, namely that neither party shall abuse or discriminate against those who have resided in the Saar region for the past three years, regardless of their political views. All disputes must be submitted to the Permanent Court of Justice in The Hague. No government may prevent anyone who wishes to leave the Saar, nor may it prohibit them from selling their property. Both governments also guarantee individual social security. In addition, a large portion of the report describes financial issues and the agreements made by the German and French governments in Rome. The full text of the agreement is also attached to the report, stating that if the Saar is to be merged with Germany in the future, France will cede all mining rights to Germany after receiving a payment of 900 million francs. The method of payment is also specified, one of which is to be calculated in coal units. In addition, there are other trivial matters, such as French loans and investments, and the currency system.

<h3>Responsibility for the Marseille Incident Included on the Agenda for this Session</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council held a closed meeting and, without discussion, unanimously decided to include the Yugoslav application on the agenda for the mid-term of this extraordinary session. The Yugoslav application originally requested the League of Nations Council to discuss the Marseille incident at the next session in order to investigate the responsibility for the crime. However, after Yugoslavia submitted the application, Hungary immediately requested the Council to take urgent action to discuss the case, hence today's resolution. (5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia's Expulsion of Beggars Causes Tensions in Central Europe to Increase</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Yugoslav government, on the pretext that the Hungarian government harbored the murderers, has angered the Yugoslav people and has now ordered the expulsion of thousands of Hungarians from the country. This move by the Yugoslav government has caused tensions in Central Europe to increase. Innocent Hungarian nationals must leave the country within a few hours and are not allowed to take much food, so they are in a very difficult situation. Yesterday, 1,000 people were repatriated to Hungary, and another 2,000 people can return home by train tomorrow. Among the Hungarians who returned home yesterday were an elderly woman aged one year and sixty years, serving her blind father, who was eighty-five years old, and carrying her four-year-old granddaughter, struggling to return to their home country. When the granddaughter arrived in Budapest, she had a large card hanging on her chest with the names and addresses of her parents. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Iraqi-Persian Border Dispute</h3>
<p>Iraq Requests League of Nations Handling</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Iraqi government today complained to the League of Nations that Persia has engaged in acts of aggression on the Iraqi border.

This article of the League of Nations Covenant states that member states may bring to the attention of the League of Nations any situation that affects international relations and may disrupt peace and goodwill.

<h3>Franco-Russian Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>Seeking to Facilitate an Eastern European Locarno Treaty</p>
<p>Doubts about a Franco-Russian Alliance Resolved</p>
<p>(Geneva) France and Russia reached an agreement here today. Both parties agreed that, before the establishment of the Eastern Locarno Pact, they would not conclude any agreements with other countries without first consulting each other. The public views this agreement as resolving doubts about the rumored Franco-Russian alliance that has been circulating recently, and it is sufficient to show that Soviet Russia now truly supports France's proposal to achieve an Eastern Locarno Pact.

<h3>Kirov's Body Cremated, Soviet Russia Executes Sixty-Six People</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Before Kirov's cremation today, Soviet Russia executed sixty-six terrorists and conspirators. Thirty-seven people were executed in Leningrad, and twenty-nine people were executed in Moscow. A few hours later, Kirov's body was cremated. The high number of executions in one day is the first since the Great Revolution. Nominally, they are not related to Kirov's assassination, as most of these people had already been sentenced to death by military tribunals and the Soviet Supreme Court. Most of these people entered the country from Poland, Latvia, and Finland. However, outsiders generally believe that this mass execution is the Communist Party's response to the anti-Soviet terrorist movement. These people had already been sentenced to death, but the executions had been delayed. Soviet party officials seized the opportunity today to order simultaneous executions before Kirov's cremation. (5th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On the 5th, the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court secretly tried 39 criminals who were preparing and organizing the assassination of Soviet officials. The court proved that most of these criminals came from Latvia, and some came from Finland and Poland. Their task was to organize terrorist activities. Based on the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and the order issued by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on December 1, the Military Collegium sentenced 37 of them to death and confiscated all their property. The remaining two will be further investigated. Those sentenced to death have already been executed. On the same day, the Military Collegium of the Soviet Supreme Court secretly tried 32 criminals with the same charges in Moscow. The court proved that most of the criminals came from Poland, and some came from Finland. Their purpose was to organize terrorist activities. Based on the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and the order issued by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on December 1, the Military Collegium sentenced 29 of the criminals to death and confiscated all their property. The remaining three will be further interrogated. Those sentenced to death have already been executed. (6th, TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Kirov's body is still lying in state in the Trade Union Hall. Yesterday afternoon, a large number of workers went to pay their respects, and it did not stop until 10:00 PM. A large crowd stood waiting regardless of the cold weather and heavy snow to enter the hall to pay their final respects, including workers, scientists, schoolchildren, and women with young children. The number of wreaths in the hall continued to increase. Friends of the deceased, party workers, factory workers, scientists, artists, authors, Red Army soldiers and officers, sailors, aviators, etc., took turns standing guard by the coffin. The honor guard was replaced every five minutes. Delegations from all over the Soviet Union are arriving one after another, sending wreaths. In these few hours, more than 1.2 million people passed through the hall to pay their respects. At 10:00 PM, the paying of respects ceased. At this time, members of the Party Central Committee, government officials, and representatives of various republics gathered in the hall, listening quietly to the mourning music. At 10:55 PM, Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Mikoyan, Chubar, Postyshev, Petrovsky, and Yezhov served as the last shift of the honor guard. At 11:40 PM, Kirov's body was cremated in front of members of the Central Committee and government officials, the Leningrad and other delegations, and the deceased's relatives. (6th, TASS)</p>

<h3>Startling Discoveries Continue in the US Arms Investigation</h3>
<p>DuPont Company Supplied Zhang Zuolin with Ammunition</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Munitions Investigating Committee today involved the DuPont Company's arms transactions with Chinese government officials, with further startling discoveries based on the DuPont Company's confidential documents. These documents were obtained by the Senate Committee and announced this morning. Senator Clark read a confidential letter from Gilis, the DuPont Company's manager in China, to Gause, the company's foreign salesperson, stating that the arms embargo against China had long been abandoned, and the Inspector General of Customs also admitted that this was the reality. The letter, dated July 31, 1924, was related to Zhang Zuolin, stating that the Chinese government was willing to incur high debts in order to satisfy its desire for war. Clark accused the DuPont Company of shipping the arms it sold to China to neutral ports to evade the arms embargo. DuPont did not admit this. Gause of the company claimed that trade with China was very strong. In 1924, 40 tons of gunpowder were smuggled into China and delivered to the Sino-Japanese Trading Company. Although the gunpowder was well-protected, it was still obtained by a certain warlord in Fengtian. In a letter from Gilis to Gause on March 28, 1925, it was stated that 20 tons of gunpowder were sold to the Sino-Japanese Trading Company and eventually shipped to Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Arsenal. This was an open violation of the arms embargo by the Japanese authorities. In addition, a Norwegian company directly sold 150 tons and 300 tons of gunpowder to Zhang Zuolin, and an Italian company sold 16,000 rifles and 28 million bullets to the Northeastern warlord.

Throughout the morning, fluctuations were mixed, hovering between $4.949375 and $4.95475. The latest price is $4.951875, an increase of 1875 points from the opening. Furthermore, one US dollar is equivalent to 4 shillings and 0.466 pence.</p>
<p>Anglo-French The opening price was 75 francs 09, the same as yesterday's price. At noon, it rose 6 pounds to 75 francs 15.</p>
<p>American-British Today, in the New York foreign exchange market, the opening exchange rate between the US dollar and the pound sterling was $4.9525, 375 points higher than yesterday. Later, it rose another 125 points to $4.95375.</p>
<p>-- Cotton and Wheat -- New York Cotton The cotton market opened slightly weaker, falling 23 points. An official from the Agricultural Adjustment Administration stated that the government has no intention of selling cotton. Rumors of a plan to control cotton production and grant concessions to small cotton farmers may be opposed.</p>
<p>New York Wheat Yesterday, the American wheat market was quite strong, but Liverpool did not reflect this, resulting in a more subdued opening for the American wheat market today. There are rumors that the US government will impose high tariffs to counteract the export of subsidized foreign wheat.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat The wheat market this morning did not fully reflect the strength of the American market. At 1 PM, the price for the May contract was 5 shillings and 5.75 pence, 875 points higher than yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton Today in the cotton market, at 1 PM, the price for the May contract remained unchanged at 6.72.</p>
<p>-- Rubber -- London The market is stable. At noon, the trading price for the April-June contract was 6 pence and 5625 points, the same as yesterday's price.</p>
<p>New York The opening was 8 to 13 points higher due to stable London communications. After the opening, prices gradually increased slightly.</p>
<p>-- Securities -- New York Before the opening of the securities market, the factors favoring the market were: (1) increased public interest and foreign purchases; (2) strong securities and commodities markets; (3) continued positive news regarding business and company dividend payouts; (4) improved European political situation; (5) yesterday's securities market activity can be seen as clear evidence that prices are expected to continue rising today. The unfavorable factor is the unstable situation of gasoline prices. The securities market opened active and stable this morning, but the gains were mostly limited to small fractions. General confidence in the future of securities is clearly growing, and the upward trend seems to be expanding. The New York securities market prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Pseudo-Organization Actually Announces Its Territory Area</h3>
<p>——Misleadingly Claiming to Be the Seventh Largest in the World——</p>
<p>——Larger Than Japan's Area——</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence, Our Northeast Four Provinces, with their vast land and abundant resources, can be called a land of abundance. Since being forcibly occupied by the Japanese army, the map has changed color. What was once Chinese territory is now subject to division by the Japanese puppets. The great rivers and mountains have been transformed for no reason, which is truly unbearable to recall. It has now been learned that the puppet government has ordered the Land Bureau of the puppet Ministry of Civil Affairs to measure the area of the puppet state and announced it on November 30th. Compared with other countries in the world, the total area of the puppet state's territory ranks only after those of England, Russia, France, China, the United States, and Italy, occupying the seventh position in the world. This can be described as extremely shameless. In order to awaken the people of the country and not forget the lost territory in the Northeast, and to plan for recovery as soon as possible, the details of the announcement are described as follows:</p>

<h3>Japanese Scheme to Occupy Inner Mongolia Intensifies</h3>
<p>Mongolians Skilled in Languages Roam Everywhere</p>
<p>Organizing Good Neighborliness Associations to Co-opt Mongolians</p>
<p>Forcing Princes and Young People of Various Banners to Be Pro-Japanese</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence, the Japanese army has recently been sending aircraft to scout the border of Chahar from time to time and distributing leaflets with threatening words. Therefore, the situation in Chahar Province is extremely critical. According to those who have returned from inspecting the Mongol border, after entering the Mongolian territory through Dushikou on November 24, they saw Japanese people everywhere they went. These so-called Japanese "Mongol experts" are familiar with the social life of the Mongolian people, and skilled in the Mongolian language. It is reported that no fewer than several hundred of these "Mongol experts" are currently traveling throughout Inner Mongolia, organizing so-called Good Neighborliness Associations to co-opt Mongolians, and also treating illnesses and providing small favors in an attempt to win people's hearts. Their intentions are far-reaching, and there is no way for our side to stop them. Furthermore, the two salt lakes, Zhengbai Banner Salt Lake and Xiangbai Banner Yamen Nuoer Salt Lake, in eastern Chahar, are more than two hundred li southwest of Duotou, and are now occupied by the puppet Manchukuo, which is implementing armed taxation. There are frequent conflicts between the puppet army and the Mongolian people. In the Selengger League, the Zhaowangfu of the Zheng League Chief, and the Beizi Temple in Abejia Wangfu, wireless telegraph stations were forcibly erected by the puppet Manchukuo to steal information about the actions of Western Mongolia. Therefore, at present, our understanding of the situation in Western Mongolia is far less clear than that of the Japanese puppets. The land in Western Mongolia is barren and mostly desert, and the Mongolian people live a very difficult life. In addition, the pasture lands have been shrinking daily, and cattle and sheep have no grass to eat, and have been moving to the ravines for food. Life is more difficult than in the past, and the crisis in Western Mongolia is becoming increasingly urgent. Although our side now has the facilities of the Mongolian Administration Council and can cooperate with some princes, the Japanese are operating in that area more thoroughly than we are, using both kindness and severity to force some powerful princes and young people with slightly newer ideas to be pro-Japanese. In addition, the Mongol experts are constantly working to exploit opportunities. If we do not find a way to deal with this as soon as possible, Western Mongolia will be unsalvageable. At present, the Japanese are exerting their political power to invade Western Mongolia. It is hoped that the people of the country will not ignore this because Western Mongolia has been peaceful recently. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Jiangxi-Fujian Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>--Various Armies Still Cooperate to Suppress Remnants of Bandits--</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, The Four Route Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression Army and the Commander-in-Chief of the Reserve Army in the Five Provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi were all concluded at the end of last month. Jiangxi and Fujian provinces have each established a Pacification Headquarters, divided into twelve pacification zones. The troops originally included in the combat sequence, in addition to those remaining under the command of the Pacification Headquarters, responsible for suppressing scattered bandits, the remaining formed a pursuit force, to advance into Hunan to suppress Zhu Mao Peng Lin Luo's fake 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, etc. army corps. Gu Zhutong and Jiang Dingwen came to the province a few days ago for the distribution of troops in the pacification zone, the liaison for clearing out bandits on the Jiangxi-Fujian border, and the implementation of post-disaster relief, have all been discussed and meticulously planned. Jiang Dingwen returned to Longyan by military plane three days ago accompanied by Counselor Zhang Jianwu and more than ten attendants, riding in three military planes. Gu also went to Nanjing on the same day with Chen Cheng to report everything to Chairman Chiang. The Fujian Pacification Headquarters was established in Longyan on the first day, and moved into Zhangzhou immediately. The Jiangxi Pacification Headquarters had already been prepared in Ji'an. Gu also telegraphed on the first day to take office. The bandit areas of Jiangxi and Fujian are adjacent and intertwined, and the junction of Lichuan, Guangchang, Shicheng, Ruijin, and Tai'ning, Jian'ning, Ninghua, and Tingzhou, where scattered bandits appear and disappear. It is still necessary to cooperate to suppress them. Therefore, Jiangxi and Fujian are jointly divided into twelve pacification zones, with eight zones in Jiangxi and four zones in Fujian. The commanders of each zone have also been announced. Chen Jicheng in northwest Jiangxi, Tan Daoyuan in west Jiangxi, Yu Hanmou and Xiang Hanping in southern Jiangxi, Zhao Guantao in northeast Jiangxi, Sun Lianzhong and Zhang Fang on the east bank of the Gan River, and Luo Zhuoying on the Jiangxi-Fujian border. The original commanders of the various columns concurrently serve in the northwest and southwest of Fujian. The Pacification Commanders of each zone have unified control and command over the troops, teams, and baojia within the zone. The administrative commissioners and county magistrates in the jurisdiction are also under their supervision, in order to coordinate the clearing of the countryside, post-disaster relief, disaster relief, construction, and restoration.

<h3>Hankou Chamber of Commerce Repeatedly Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to Strive for Freedom of Cash Transportation</h3>
<p>The Jianghan Customs Detains Cash, Please Return It Quickly</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, Hankou's financial situation previously caused great disturbance due to the Ministry of Finance's restriction on cash transportation to Hubei. The Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to strive for freedom. In recent days, cash imports have slightly improved, and the situation is slightly better. The commercial sector is fortunate to be able to turn around. However, a Wuhan business previously transported cash to Hankou, but was suddenly detained by the Jianghan Customs, causing another twist. The business community believes that Hankou is the most important commercial center in central China, connecting the north and south. If this case is not resolved, the city's commerce will inevitably decline and go bankrupt. Therefore, on the 5th, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again to strive for freedom of cash transportation and requested that the Jianghan Customs be ordered to quickly return the detained cash. The telegram stated that cash should circulate as a principle, and if there is any obstruction, the financial market will inevitably be chaotic. For example, after the autumn harvest in Hubei Province, local products enter the market, and farmers are used to transacting in cash. At this time, the use of cash, in particular, requires flexible turnover. Wuxue is an important town in the lower reaches of Hubei Province and is also a cotton-producing area with very complex commercial exchanges with Hankou. The fact that cash transported to Hankou has been detained means that Hankou merchants must carry cash to that place to purchase cotton, which will inevitably lead to the inability to export. Furthermore, the transportation of goods to various counties and cities to purchase local goods, as well as the transportation of cash from various counties and cities to Hankou, cannot be free. If cash cannot circulate freely within the province and local products cannot be listed on the market, life will be extremely difficult and there will be no way to adjust the situation. How can rural areas be rescued and the market prospered? This financial reorganization policy is inevitably unsustainable and without a source. The association feels that this is dangerous and dares not remain silent. Therefore, we specially urge the ministry to investigate and approve and to quickly seek relief. For the circulation of cash within Hubei Province, we request that free transportation be permitted. If it is necessary to prevent abuses, the cash transported from Hankou to various counties and cities should be allowed to apply for a passport at the Jianghan Customs. The cash transported from various counties and cities to Hankou or from Hankou to various counties and cities should be certified by the local Chamber of Commerce in order to ensure smooth flow and rescue agriculture and commerce. At the same time, we request that the provincial government forward a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, approving the requested justification, and ordering the military and police agencies along the land and water routes, as well as various tax collection bureaus, to inspect and release all cash transferred within the province, without any obstruction, in order to provide relief and avoid panic.

<h3>Yantai Market Suddenly Experiences Great Panic</h3>
<p>--Treacherous Merchants Transport Silver to Dalian--</p>
<p>--Creating a Major Crisis in the Market--</p>
<p>--Jinan's Finance Is Also Tense--</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, Jinan's financial market has always been quite stable, but unexpectedly, an unprecedented storm has occurred in Yantai. Since the increase in the price of silver, a large amount of silver has been exported from various places. Yantai and Dalian are only separated by a strip of water, and transportation is extremely convenient. Recently, every thousand yuan of silver transported to Dalian can earn more than eighty yuan. A group of treacherous merchants, who only seek profit, have been secretly transporting silver there. Although the Finance Department previously restricted the export of silver, each person could carry no more than two hundred yuan. However, the treacherous merchants are making large profits from smuggling and are hiring people to carry silver out of the country on their behalf, with subsidies of three yuan or less per two hundred yuan. After deducting expenses, they still have a profit of forty or fifty yuan for every thousand yuan transported. Later, the Finance Department changed the limit to no more than fifty yuan per person, and then to twenty yuan. However, the treacherous merchants are still making large profits and continue to smuggle silver. Since so much silver has been exported, the Yantai market has been completely empty, creating an unprecedented panic in the financial world, and economic turnover is sluggish. Since last Friday (30th), all transactions in cloth have completely stopped, and people are in a state of panic. The Yantai Chamber of Commerce and Zhang Kuiwen, the Yantai Special Zone Administrative Commissioner and concurrently Director of the Public Security Bureau, have summoned the China, Communications, and Minsheng Banks in Yantai to discuss emergency measures. They decided that each bank should issue banknotes as much as possible to circulate in the market, but they felt that there was a severe shortage of silver, and they planned to temporarily suspend cash redemption to maintain the status quo. When the news reached Jinan, the Finance Department and the Minsheng, Communications, and China Banks believed that the method of suspending cash redemption was inappropriate. They decided to issue banknotes as much as possible and to transport a large amount of silver to Yantai for normal cash redemption to provide relief. On the 2nd, Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, summoned Song Fuqi, Deputy Manager of Minsheng Bank, Chen Junren, Manager of China Bank, and Guo Weibai, Deputy Manager of Communications Bank, to discuss ways to rescue Yantai's finances. They decided that on the one hand, the Finance Department would issue an order to absolutely prohibit the export of silver, and on the other hand, each bank would transport silver to Yantai to maintain the situation and issue more banknotes. In the past two days, Minsheng, Communications, and China Banks have transported hundreds of thousands of yuan in silver to Yantai, and they will continue to transport silver according to the needs of the area. The Finance Department also summoned the managers of various banks and major silver houses on the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jinan's banks, seeing that there is a shortage of silver everywhere, especially in Yantai, are not only allocating cash from Jinan to rescue Yantai, but also issuing banknotes in Jinan. Fearing a run on the banks, they are collecting cash to prepare for unexpected events. On the one hand, they are transferring three to four million yuan in cash from Shanghai, and on the other hand, they are tightening the market in Jinan and extracting cash from various silver houses. As a result, the market has suddenly become tight. Shanghai drafts have fallen from 13 yuan per thousand on the 3rd to 18 yuan on the 4th, a drop of 5 yuan. Shanghai telegraphic transfers have fallen from 7 yuan per thousand on the 3rd to 3 yuan on the 4th, a drop of 6 yuan. As for lending, everyone is wary and dares not lend much. Interest rates have soared. On the 3rd, the rate for one and a half months was 1.6%, and the rate for two months was 1.7%. On the 4th, the rate rose to 1.7% for one and a half months and 1.75% for two months. (4th)</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Diary by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>The Terrifying Encounter After Passing Xingxingxia</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM on the 13th, we departed from Malianjing. We encountered a blue-black desert for about twenty li. To the northwest, the Xingxingxia mountain range rose and fell intermittently, with alternating dark and bright sunlight. The vast expanse of misty waters created ever-changing, eerie reflections, a scene truly unlike anything in the interior. After another ten li, we saw several circles of ruined foundations and a short stele, marking the Jiaoya Gou, the boundary between Gansu and Xinjiang. After passing this point, dusk had already fallen, and a crescent moon hung askew. We traveled over undulating terrain for about thirty li before reaching a place with lush grass and abundant water, where we camped for the night. The day's journey was over sixty li, about ten li from Xingxingxia Station. There were over ten wells at the campsite, and water could be drawn with a bucket only three or four feet deep. Unfortunately, only one well had sweet water; the rest contained alkali and saltpeter, which even the camels wouldn't drink.</p>
<p>After setting up camp and preparing tea, one of the camel drivers returned from gathering firewood, exclaiming in alarm, "I saw a light in the distance, gradually moving towards our tents. I fear it's not a friendly presence! What should we do?" The escort team originally consisted of seven men, but because the Xingxingxia and Shiban Jing stations lacked grass and fodder, it was inconvenient to permanently station troops. In the morning, five men had been left to guard Malianjing, and the remaining two, soldiers from Han Lianfu's troops, were specially assigned to escort us out of the gorge. Upon hearing the camel driver's warning, they immediately grabbed their rifles and went outside to investigate. After circling the tents, they found no light at all. They then asked the camel driver to lead them back to the original spot. Looking in the same direction, the bright light reappeared as before. However, after careful observation, they realized the light was not approaching from afar but shining through a hole in the top of the tent. They suddenly realized it was a case of being scared by one's own shadow, and everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>We set off the next morning. The red willow and white thorn bushes stretched endlessly, interspersed with spike-shaped pink flowers, which were particularly lovely. Sadly, the harsh cold of the frontier meant that ice and snow would arrive early, and this autumn scenery would soon wither. After ten li, we entered the gorge. Initially, the road forked, but here it converged into a single path. The sturdy grass and branches along the roadside were covered with clumps of cotton, which, if collected, would easily amount to dozens of catties. This was because cotton merchants transported the cotton from Turpan and Hami. As they passed through the gorge and exited, the small donkeys, upon seeing the grassland, raced ahead, causing the bags to break and the cotton to spill out. At the entrance to the gorge, the ridges and peaks were interwoven, with countless piles of stones stacked on top. There are three possible explanations for their formation: (1) Ma Zhongying's first entry into Xinjiang, when retreating through the gorge after a defeat, fearing an attack by pursuing troops, dug a long trench and erected black stones to create a feigned force. This occurred in 1931. (2) In the desolate wilderness of the desert, loose soil and open fields are easily swept away by wind and sandstorms. Therefore, stone piles were built in advance as markers, similar to the Mongolian "Obo." (3) Superstitious travelers often pile stones to resemble pagodas, praying for good fortune. If they stand for a long time without falling, they are particularly pleased. The stone piles related to explanations (2) and (3) were commonly seen during our journey. However, when they were first created is unknown.</p>
<p>The gorge is a dry sandy riverbed, overgrown with Malian grass. The pods burst when ripe, resembling orchids. On both sides, the cliffs rise thousands of feet, steep and terrifying. Erosion from wind and rain has created holes as large as mortars. Six or seven blockhouses have been built on top, and two or three barracks have been constructed below, clearly demonstrating its military importance. The gorge station used to have twenty or thirty households, all of which were destroyed and burned, with none intact. The three temples—the Temple of Guan Yu, the Hall of Guanyin, and the Jade Emperor Pavilion—were built according to the mountain's terrain and were originally magnificent and imposing. Now, they are covered in mud and debris. A lonely postal worker resides in the temple, his thoughts unknown as he lives with the dim lamp and ancient Buddhas. It is said that the gorge produces stones that shimmer like starlight, and ten li from the gorge, there is a Xingxing Dong (Star Cave), hence the name Xingxingxia. However, the construction records of the Jade Emperor Pavilion and Xinjiang gazetteers refer to it as Xingxingxia. Ultimately, it remains to be verified who is right and wrong, or whether both names are equally acceptable.</p>
<p>Near Xingxing Dong, there are many crystal stones. Several columns grow from a single base, and people from Anxi often dig them up and plant them in wooden vessels to enjoy their beauty. The crystals sparkle and gleam, dazzling the eyes. In another Temple of Guan Yu, three or four li outside the gorge, it is said that there used to be two large crystals, each two feet square, but they were sadly destroyed in the fire along with the temple. Behind the temple, there is a steep stone path carved by hand. A stone tablet stands in front of the temple, warning people to be careful. After descending the stone path, we traveled along the sandy riverbed, turning from north to west for over twenty li. The high mountains on either side of the river were naturally steep and treacherous. The mountains were devoid of vegetation and mostly composed of sandy cliffs. Yellow, white, red, and black colors distinguished the peaks. Looking ahead, the mountains seemed to pierce the sky, like bamboo shoots emerging after rain. The road ahead was vast and invisible. Some say that the jagged black mountains are outcrops of coal, but this is not true.</p>
<p>The reporter dismounted and walked, examining the shiny stones. I was thinking that in such a desolate place, in times of war, one man could hold off ten thousand. Suddenly, I heard a faint shout of "Stop! Stop!" Looking back, I saw Akim running towards me, shouting, "Three riders armed with guns have been spotted at the small fork in the road to the right and rear!" Upon hearing this, Han Lianfu and Ma's soldiers immediately threw off their old sheepskin robes, which they had been wearing on horseback, onto the ground. They quickly loaded their rifles and prepared to fire. The camel train also stopped ringing its bells and halted. Akim rode out alone to inquire. The three riders also approached, and then from the direction of Xingxingxia, where the dust was rising, over ten riders shouted and galloped towards us. Behind them, the glint of guns was faintly visible. Han Lianfu glanced at the cliffs on either side, his face turning pale, as if asking himself, "What can be done?" He quietly told the reporter to "crouch down." At that moment, Akim waved his hand, shouting, "Come, come, come!" The reporter followed Han Ma and went towards him. The ten or so riders who had come later also galloped up and surrounded us. Some had wispy beards, others had long, mixed white beards. Some wore long robes like Mongolians, while others wore Zhongshan suits and military uniforms with Qing Tian Bai Ri (Blue Sky with a White Sun) emblems on their hats. In total, there were fourteen riders. After Akim introduced them, we learned that they were the garrison troops sent by Yao Lebos, the garrison commander of Hami and Zhenxi, to escort us.</p>
<p>We immediately dismounted, exchanged greetings, and took photos to commemorate the occasion. They then took the reins and galloped ahead, quickly disappearing into the distance. Initially, Commander Yao had received a telegram from Anxi's Regiment Commander Ma, stating that Xingxingxia fell within his garrison's jurisdiction, so he had also sent troops to escort us. These troops were eager to meet us quickly and took a shortcut, almost completely missing us if not for the three riders coming from behind. The local custom of the garrison troops is to shave their heads but not their beards. Thus, although the soldiers had the appearance of "Old General Huang Zhong," their spirit of galloping and shooting was no less impressive than that of young men. Among them, the Long Tong Shui Ka (Company Commander), "Togutman," and the Company Commander "Tunlan Kele," along with three or four others, were knowledgeable, spoke fluent Chinese, and were available for consultation. Their hospitality was especially appreciated. In the evening, we arrived at Shitou Jingzi (also known as Xiaohong Liuyuan), a journey of sixty li. We set up camp and cooked dinner. The garrison troops had arrived earlier and were staying in a dilapidated Temple of Guan Yu. They also came to our tents one after another. Initially, they let the reporter sit in the central position at the rear of the tent, facing the entrance. To the left were Han Lianfu's soldiers from Anxi, Akim and others, in the host position. To the right were Company Commander Tunlan Kele, Commander Togutman, and the other garrison troops, in the guest position. Whether host or guest, everyone sat in a circle around the brick tea stove burning camel dung in the center of the ground. Those who wanted to leave the tent would walk in front of people, to the left or right, but never behind. The two pillars supporting the tent and the stove in the center were in a straight line, forming the boundary between the left and right sides. Those who passed between the stove and the rear pillar (the front pillar near the entrance was not restricted), or deliberately made noise with the fire tongs, or only held one end of the pot ear and dragged it on the ground, or placed their chopsticks on the bowl after eating instead of handing them to the "Zhua Guo (cook)" for washing, were all considered to have violated the rules and were fined. The "Zhang Gui (boss)" was fined double. These tent rules were somewhat similar to those of a Mongolian yurt.</p>
<p>That night, we met the garrison troops for the first time and had interesting conversations. The reporter had not learned the local language, so direct conversation was difficult. Those who could speak Chinese seemed shy and did not speak much. Akim acted as an "interpreter," and we were able to begin our pleasant conversation. The reporter said, "I deeply admire you gentlemen for coming so far to escort us. When we reach a more populated area, you will be rewarded." Akim immediately translated this, and they repeatedly said "Hash (meaning 'yes')" incessantly. Then, they all raised their hands to express their gratitude and replied, "We came here to welcome you on orders. We set off in a hurry and didn't even have time to bring any Hami melons. We also didn't manage to hunt any yellow sheep or wild horses along the way. We are very sorry." The reporter said again, "I am very grateful for your protection." They replied, "You and we are all sons born of the same father. We are here to protect you, which is like brothers protecting brothers. Moreover, this is our duty as people who receive rations. There is no need for thanks. However, the photo we took when we met today probably didn't turn out well. We would like to tidy up our uniforms and take another one." The reporter nodded in agreement, saying, "Marching in the Gobi Desert makes it difficult to be too meticulous. Moreover, you are wearing the Qing Tian Bai Ri emblem on your military caps, which is identical to those used by the Central Army, giving people the best impression." After eating hand-grabbed rice, only the company commander and commander stayed in the tent, while the other brothers returned to the dilapidated temple, each sleeping in their saddles.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Sojourners from Huzhou Organize Opera Performance to Raise Disaster Relief Funds</h3>
<p>This year, the six counties of Huzhou suffered severe drought and disaster. People from Huzhou residing in Shanghai organized a disaster relief committee to raise funds.

<h3>Songjiang Police Inspector Resigns to Take Another Position</h3>
<p>Mr. Yan Jishi, the police inspector of this county's Public Security Bureau, has recently accepted an invitation from his friend Zhang Hanwei, the former police inspector of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the current director of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, to take a position.

<h3>An Unexpected Turn in the Wuxi Girl's Suicide Case</h3>
<p>Zhou Yufen, a girl from Hexiang Bridge in Jiangyin County (namely the maidservant of Dr. Zhu Daji's family), committed suicide by taking poison in room 43 of the Park Hotel the day before. Because the poison was so potent, she was taken to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died from the poison that evening. The next day, Zhou's mother, Qu, and her sisters, Yuying and Bao, heard the news and came to Wuxi from Cheng. They wailed loudly at the Dongmenwai Hostel Public Office, which was heartbreaking to those who heard it. However, because of their poverty, they had no money for a coffin, so they went to Dr. Zhu Daji's house at No. 40 Dalou Lane to beg for help. To their surprise, the Zhu family not only refused but also scolded Zhou's mother harshly, beat her, and accused her of colluding with the teahouse waiter, Tan Genda, to extort money, resulting in her being taken to the Public Security First Branch Bureau. After questioning by Bureau Member Fan, Zhou Yuying, the sister of the deceased, stated that her sister, Zhou Yufen, was a maidservant in Dr. Zhu Daji's family, and this suicide was caused by a relationship with Zhu Daji, as stated in her suicide note. According to Zhu Daji, the suicide of Zhou Yufen had nothing to do with him, and Zhou's mother came to borrow coffin money, which was tantamount to extortion. After obtaining the confessions, Bureau Member Fan considered the case to be serious and immediately prepared a document to transfer it to the General Bureau, which will then transfer it to the local branch court for trial.</p>
<h3>The Manager of Qinchang Silk Factory Flees with the Funds</h3>
<p>The Qinchang Silk Factory in Tieshu Bridge outside the South Gate was opened by Chen Yinglong, a silk merchant from Shanghai, and Ding Qinsheng, a local resident. The factory has been in operation for less than two months. The factory's silk was usually sold in Shanghai by the manager, Chen Yinglong. However, Chen had ulterior motives and recently absconded with all the silk funds, avoiding seeing anyone. This caused the factory's finances to become strained. The assistant manager, Ding Qinsheng, also fled a few days ago because he found it difficult to maintain the factory. As a result, the factory was forced to shut down, owing more than twenty days' wages to the female workers and more than a month's salary to the staff. Currently, staff members Pan Helin, Wei Xiufang, and Pu Yinhuan have impounded and stored the factory's remaining cocoons. They have also published a notice to inform Assistant Manager Ding to come forward to handle the situation so that it can be resolved.</p>

Soon, the fire spread to the neighbors. Fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene and fought hard to extinguish the flames. However, because the lanes were narrow and the roads were rugged, fire engines could not enter, and the lack of water made it even more difficult to extinguish the fire. The county party headquarters commissioned Bu Yulin and Yan Deshen, the owner of Loudong Park, to extinguish the fire. Their residences were also reduced to ashes. The fire was gradually extinguished at around 8:00 PM, having destroyed more than twenty tile and thatched houses, resulting in significant losses.</p>

They caught more than ten people playing mahjong on the spot, as well as thirty or forty others shaking dice and drinking tea. Patrol Officer Zhang, without distinguishing between right and wrong, wanted to search everyone present, which aroused public anger. For a time, there was a great clamor, and the crowd began to shout and hit the police. The patrol officers fired two warning shots into the air, which further incited the crowd. The gamblers were protected and escorted out of the teahouse. Later, the town's merchant corps came to maintain order and asked the teahouse owner to sign a bond at the town office.

<h3>Yang Yongtai Discusses the Imminent Eradication of Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Sichuan Province's Bandit Suppression Measures Finalized</p>
<p>Nanchang Headquarters Will Not Be Moved for the Time Being</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for the Three Provinces, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to attend to personal matters. Yesterday morning, Mr. Yang received visiting reporters at his residence. According to him, the banditry in Jiangxi Province is being completely eliminated through relentless encirclement and suppression. The remaining Communist bandits in the four provinces of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi number less than 100,000, with about 40,000 to 50,000 of them roaming outside. Only half of these remaining bandits have guns, the rest are unarmed, and their strength is extremely weak. It is expected that they can all be eradicated within six months. Communist banditry in Sichuan Province has gradually spread in recent years. The reason for this is that the troops in the province lack coordination. Recently, Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan Province, repeatedly met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing to seek instructions on bandit suppression. Measures have been taken to reorganize the troops in Sichuan Province, and the military operations for bandit suppression in Sichuan Province can proceed smoothly hereafter. Regarding the relocation of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for the Three Provinces, Mr. Yang stated that it is too early to discuss this. Although the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province are about to be eradicated, the local vitality has not been restored, and it is inevitable that some petty thieves will remain in hiding and disrupt public order. Therefore, the headquarters still needs to handle other political work. However, if necessary in the future, it may be moved to Sichuan Province. Mr. Yang further stated that he accompanied Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on an inspection tour of various places in North China. He was very impressed along the way. North China is quite calm now, and local order is gradually becoming peaceful. As for the rumors that he will go north to preside over political and diplomatic affairs, they are absolutely inaccurate. Moreover, Huang Yingbai was originally appointed as the Minister of the Interior as a concurrent position, and he himself will not leave Beiping. Mr. Yang concluded by saying that the New Life Movement is being promoted extensively in various places. This is the ancient Chinese morality that has been neglected by the Chinese people in recent years, leading to near extinction. He earnestly hopes that the Chinese people will quickly rise up and promote it.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai and Discusses</h3>
<p>Optimism About National Affairs After Sun and Wang Head South</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan Tan Zhen arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the night express train at 7:20 yesterday morning. After getting off the train, they returned to their residences to rest. At 11:30, Huang Shaoxiong visited Kong at the Central Bank to discuss political affairs. Mr. Kong then received reporters from various newspapers and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Sun and Wang Head South</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Kong, President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Zhesheng and Wang Chonghui are heading south to Hong Kong and Guangzhou to meet with Hu Zhantang, Chen Bonan, and others to discuss matters related to national unity. Sun and Wang have already sent a telegram to Beijing after meeting with Hu, detailing the meeting, which was very satisfactory. The Central Committee members in Guangdong also believe that national unity is the only key to survival and expressed their delight. Therefore, it is expected that the results of Sun and Wang's trip will be very satisfactory, and the future of national affairs is very optimistic. Sun has decided to leave Guangdong and return north within days because the Fifth Plenary Session is about to open. He can arrive before the meeting. Some of the Central Committee members in Guangdong will accompany him to Beijing. It was not mentioned whether Wang can return north before the meeting.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Members Arrive in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session is scheduled to open in Beijing on the 10th. Central Committee members from various places are arriving in Beijing to register, and the legal quorum has been exceeded. The work report of the Ministry of Finance has been drafted and will be submitted to the conference for reporting. He himself has no proposals.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee of the Economic Council</h3>
<p>The fourth standing committee meeting of the National Economic Council was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing last week. At that time, it was postponed due to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's toothache. Now it is learned that after the dentist treated Chiang's toothache, eight useless teeth have been pulled out and dentures have been installed. The current situation is very good, so the standing committee meeting can be held within days. Whether it will be held before or after the Fifth Plenary Session will be decided temporarily after Standing Committee Member Song (Ziwen) and others arrive in Beijing. There is no news that Chiang is coming to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province's Finances</h3>
<p>Regarding the financial problems of Sichuan Province, Liu Xiang, the Director of Rehabilitation Affairs of the province, met with him twice in Beijing and agreed on a solution for the future. However, it is definitely not to issue public bonds. The news in today's newspaper that Sichuan Province will issue 40 million in public bonds is absolutely not true. However, the Ministry of Finance has decided to maintain and assist the finances of Sichuan Province. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a branch of the Central Bank in Chongqing so that the financial stability of the province can be followed by the development of all industries. As for the problem of prohibiting the smuggling of silver exports, the Ministry of Finance has requested</p>

<h3>US Senate Philippine Investigation Group Returned to the Country on the Original Ship Yesterday</h3>
<p>Inspecting the Commercial Situation of the Philippine Ports</p>
<p>The Reality of Japanese Dumping in the Philippines</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the five-member US Senate Philippine Investigation Group arrived in Shanghai on the Canadian Empress yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, they attended a banquet hosted by the US Consul General, Keninghan, and visited various places in the afternoon. At 7:00 last night, they took the original ship to the Philippines for investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Pre-Departure Interview</h3>
<p>Before boarding the ship, reporters interviewed the investigation group. Most of them kept their mouths shut and remained silent. Then, one of the members told the reporter that they are going to the Philippines to investigate the commercial situation of the Philippines. The US government is now paying close attention to the interests of the Japanese in the Philippines. The Philippines is about to become independent and organize an autonomous republic. The US government will pay more attention to the actions of the Japanese in the Philippines in the future.</p>
<h3>Organization Process</h3>
<p>According to the organization of the Philippine Investigation Group, after the Philippine Parliament passed the Philippine Independence Act last year, it proposed to the US Senate to organize an investigation group to go to the Philippines to investigate the commercial changes in the region after independence. The proposal was approved by the US Congress last summer. Then, Senator Ellison Hayden went to the Philippines in August to conduct a preliminary investigation before returning to the country to report.</p>
<h3>Investigation Purpose</h3>
<p>It is reported that the US Congress is now most concerned about the Philippine sugar industry, because the Japanese have been dumping in the Philippines recently, which has greatly affected Philippine sugar, and business has plummeted. In addition, the group will also discuss measures to deal with the dumping of Japanese goods in the Philippines and issues such as "preferential tariffs."</p>
<h3>Investigation Personnel</h3>
<p>The investigation group has a total of five people, including Senate Senators McTudor (California), Miller (Maryland), McLane (Tennessee), Chipson (Washington), and the captain of the US Marine Corps in China, Baimeng, accompanied them to the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Banquets Overseas Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Representatives Continue to Visit National Goods Factories</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the five plenary representatives from Siam, Penang, and the Dutch territories have been extremely busy since arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. In recent days, Liang Bozhi of Liang Xinji Toothbrush Factory has guided them to visit various factories separately. The representatives have praised the progress of domestic goods products. Yesterday, they visited the Ma Baoshan Food Factory, because the factory is the successor of Ma Yushan, and its products have long been popular in the South Seas and are deeply trusted by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, the representatives were satisfied after the visit. In the afternoon, they visited the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and the Jingwei Factory, browsing in great detail. They praised the products produced by the factory as the most beautiful of domestic goods. After the tour, they attended a banquet hosted by President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan. It is reported that the representatives have been living in the South Seas for a long time and are not familiar with the domestic industrial situation. Taking advantage of the postponement of the conference, they plan to stay in Shanghai for a few more days to make a detailed visit. Therefore, they still entrusted Liang Bozhi to continue to guide them to visit various factories.</p>

It is reported that he was examining the illness of Zeng Zhongming, Deputy Minister of Railways. Last night, it was widely rumored that Zeng had food poisoning and had flown to Shanghai for treatment yesterday. Our reporter specifically inquired at his Shanghai residence. His family said that Zeng had just gone to Beijing from Shanghai last week, and they had no news about what illness he was suffering from. It was even more unfounded to say that he had come to Shanghai. Perhaps he had a slight illness, so he invited Dr. Knauer to treat him.</p>

<h3>Salt Affairs Audit Office Streamlines National Salt Affairs</h3>
<p>—— Draft Opinion on Controlling the Salt Industry ——</p>
<p>—— Continuous Study and Contribution Accepted by the Ministry of Finance ——</p>
<p>According to New Voice News Agency, the Salt Affairs Audit Office has completed the streamlining of national salt affairs and has drafted an opinion on controlling the salt industry. Director Zhu, Transport Officer Miao, and Auditor Yao have been studying it in Shanghai for days and will contribute it to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. The reporter of New Voice News Agency has obtained the streamlining process and the research and control situation, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Streamlining Field Production</h3>
<p>The Salt Affairs Audit Office was established in January of the second year of the Republic of China, originally established to improve salt administration, streamline tax revenue, and unify national salt affairs, centralizing power in the central government. It is divided into four periods: (1) the start-up period, from the second to the sixth year of the Republic of China; (2) the organizational completion period, from the seventh to the twelfth year of the Republic of China; (3) the period of interference by local authorities, from the thirteenth to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China; and (4) the recovery and streamlining period, from the eighteenth to the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. Streamlining is now complete. Streamlining field production and managing the storage of salt are the most important tasks for consolidating tax revenue. Therefore, the first step in streamlining field production is to build assembly mounds and concentrate salt storage for management. In the past, the General Office proposed building large-scale salt mounds in the Changlu area as a model for each area. Subsequently, official warehouses were built in the Furongdong Field in southern Sichuan, which merchants and residents still find convenient today. In February of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, in imitation of Changlu, it was decided to start with northern Huai. Today, the Huai North Salt Mound has been completed, and salt warehouses have been built on the four banks of the Yangtze River. Zhejiang, Songjiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shandong are all preparing to build salt mounds in imitation of the Huai North model. However, in Changlu, during the forty-something years of the Republic of China, the anti-smuggling camps were extremely corrupt, and the field was leaking private salt, which could not be investigated or prohibited. Due to the failure to effectively manage the field production, even with good salt mounds, smuggling could not be prevented. Now that administrative affairs are also handled, the construction of salt mounds and the streamlining of anti-smuggling efforts are carried out at the same time, which is twice as effective and has achieved great results. Therefore, private salt in northern Huai is now sharply reduced, and tax revenue is increasing daily. Although it is due to the large amount of sales, it is also closely related to the field production management method. The source of private salt is entirely in the field. If the field does not leak private salt, how can there be any private salt? In the future, when the mound projects in Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Songjiang, Shandong, and other areas are completed, the results will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Streamlining Transportation and Sales</h3>
<p>The transportation of salt is the pivot of salt production and sales. If there is production, there must be sales. Merchants and vendors must pay taxes before transporting salt for sale and are allowed to pay with promissory notes. Therefore, transportation and sales are the root of excise tax. The more salt is sold, the more tax revenue increases. China's salt trade is bound by the system of licenses. The transportation and sale of salt are not free, which greatly hinders the streamlining of salt affairs. After the establishment of the Audit Office, it first advocated improving the transportation system. The first important point is to abolish the exclusive merchants and allow the people to trade freely. From the third year of the Republic of China to the eighth or ninth year of the Republic of China, the areas where licenses were opened included the northern Huai, Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Shanxi areas, and a part of Changlu. At that time, the results were quite considerable, but unfortunately, the political situation was unstable, and some areas changed back. The destruction in Sichuan and Fujian was particularly severe. The improvement of transportation and sales should be absolutely free. If progress is too rapid, it will inevitably cause resentment. The Audit Office has always been based on gradual progress in reform matters. At present, a transitional method is temporarily adopted. In August of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the contracted merchants in eastern Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Chu were abolished, and free trade was implemented. After the opening, as of the end of this year, the tax revenue collected in five months totaled more than 583,000 yuan, an increase of more than 159,000 yuan compared with the tax revenue before the opening. In March of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the exclusive merchants in the four counties of Lin, Tan, Fei, and Yi in Shandong were abolished, and free trade was restored. All transportation and sales in the four counties were changed to free areas. As for the four banks of the Yangtze River, which have always been known as corrupt, in April of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, it was agreed that the Huai salt on the four banks, whether in the field or on the shore, should be at the highest standard of the current set price, and merchants should be allowed to freely reduce prices under the standard legal price to compete for sales. As for the former four banks of southern Huai, which were known as the twelfth Wei as the corrupt den, the Huai salt transported to the Wei was usually under the jurisdiction of the Transport Envoy. During the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Northern Huai Sub-Office Manager consulted with the Tuizhou Sub-Office on the rotation of transport on the four banks, but the Transport Envoy of both Huai strongly opposed it, and it was not implemented. Now, the promotion of direct rotation of transport has achieved significant results. Most of the salt is directly transported from the Huai North production area to the shore, while the salt transported from the twelfth Wei is still transported by sail. Now, a method is being sought to abolish sail transport. However, merchants, boat owners, and dock laborers are all people who eat corruption. The streamlining of salt affairs was originally to eliminate corruption, and the Yang General Station should be abolished. How can sail transport be retained? The fundamental streamlining should still improve the transportation system and gradually proceed to prepare for the implementation of new laws.</p>
<h3>Streamlining Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Streamlining tax rates. In the early years of the Republic of China, the tax rates were chaotic and there were many types. After the establishment of the Audit Office, the improvement of salt tax began with the elimination of all kinds of tax items and unified them. In October of the second year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Salt Tax Regulations and stipulated uniform weights and measures for tax collection and weighing of salt. Before the promulgation of the statutory weights and measures, the national salt affairs temporarily used the Sima scale as the weight and measure. These regulations stipulated that salt tax should be levied per dan, with a tax of 2.5 yuan per 100 jin, and stated that it was for temporary use. Once the Salt Law was promulgated, it would be stopped. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, the Salt Tax Regulations were revised again, with a tax of 3 yuan per dan. However, the conditions in each region were different, and uniform taxation throughout the country was difficult to implement. However, in the third and fourth years of the Republic of China, the new tax was implemented. Although the four banks of the Yangtze River and the Yunnan area failed to follow the Salt Tax Regulations, with each dan exceeding 4 yuan or exceeding 3 yuan, the audit side advocated tax before salt, eliminating the malpractice of tax arrears from the past, which was indeed effective. However, since the fifth year of the Republic of China, military affairs have frequently arisen, and various provinces have added surcharges in addition to the regular tax to raise funds. The tax rates in various regions have become uneven again. Now that we are streamlining, all low-tax areas are raised, and high-tax areas are gradually reduced. The various local and central surcharges are numerous and difficult to assess, and have been consolidated. All field taxes paid in the production area and the central surcharge are collectively called the regular tax. The shore tax paid in the sales area and the central surcharge are collectively called the sales tax. The local surcharge is collectively called the surcharge. Salt tax revenue must be compared with sales volume. In recent five years, tax revenue has been increasing, and the heavy tax rate is one reason, and the sales volume is also very important. China's population is said to be 400 million or more. The total sales volume of salt should reach more than 50 million dan. If private salt can be eliminated, tax revenue will definitely increase without increasing taxes. Therefore, we must strengthen the management of field production, streamline anti-smuggling efforts, and work hard to combine the symptoms and the root cause. In the future, private salt can be reduced. Then, the low-tax salt can be increased, and uniform taxation throughout the country will definitely be achieved. The implementation of the new law should be used as the beginning of this.</p>
<h3>Streamlining Anti-Smuggling</h3>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, the salt affairs agencies did not have formal salt patrols. Only the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had salt-catching camps, patrolling the Taihu Lake and Yangzhou areas, under the jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Liangjiang and the Governor of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. All commanders and leaders were recruited from salt smugglers. The patrolmen in each production and sales area were mostly recruited by merchants themselves, called merchant patrols. These salt patrols were nothing more than organs for various exclusive merchants to smuggle. In the early years of the Republic of China, anti-smuggling camps were established. Later, field police were established in the field area, all under the jurisdiction of the Transport Envoy or Deputy Transport Envoy and the Salt Transport Bureau. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, an anti-smuggling office was established within the Ministry of Finance, and anti-smuggling bureaus were established in various regions, while the field police were still under the administrative agencies. In the eighteenth year, the anti-smuggling bureaus were changed back to the jurisdiction of the Transport Envoy, Deputy Transport Envoy, and Salt Transport Bureau. It was not until March of the twentieth year that the Ministry of Finance submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was submitted to the State Council for discussion and resolution, to change the anti-smuggling teams and field police in the provinces to the jurisdiction of the audit agencies. The handover was carried out by various regions in April and May. After taking over, the anti-smuggling teams were changed to tax police, and the camp system was changed to a district system. Tax police sections were established in the various sub-offices and audit offices, or in the tax collection bureaus, and were directly commanded by the managers of the sub-offices and the auditors of the audit offices. The candidates for section chiefs, district chiefs, and team leaders were all selected and appointed by the General Office. All officers and police, from officers to police officers, were issued personal certificates with photos, stating the year and month of arrival, experience, and guarantors to prevent fraud. Tax police officer training centers were established in various regions to ensure that everyone can fulfill their duties and abide by discipline. By comparing the sales of salt in recent years, the effectiveness of streamlining anti-smuggling can be proved.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Malpractices</h3>
<p>Malpractices are illicit gains, one being customary regulations, also known as regulation fees. The accumulation of abuses in salt affairs is the worst of these. For more than ten years, no one has reformed them. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the administrative agencies were changed to be concurrently held by the audit side. Since taking over, the biggest abuse in the administrative aspect has been the acceptance of malpractices. It has been practiced for a long time and is taken for granted. Those who offer bribes consider it an obligation, and those who receive them regard it as a right. Greed has become a trend, and they are not ashamed. How can salt affairs not be bad? To seek the integrity of administration, the elimination of malpractices must be an urgent task. Therefore, the General Office strictly ordered all regions to fundamentally eliminate all kinds of malpractices. All concurrently appointed personnel were able to be honest and law-abiding and strictly prohibited all items of malpractices. Thus, the accumulation of hundreds of years of abuses was completely eliminated, which was a major innovation in salt affairs.</p>
<h3>Planned Control</h3>
<p>After the Salt Affairs Inspection Office completes the reorganization of national salt affairs, it plans to implement unified control of the national salt industry. Miao Qiujie, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai, has already drafted an opinion paper. For days, Zhu Tingqi, the Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, Yao Yuanlun, the Inspector of Hubei Bank, and Miao Qiujie, the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai, have been studying the opinion paper at the Shanghai Inspection Office. A decision will be made to submit it to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation upon completion of the study. It is believed that this unified control opinion, once adopted and implemented by the Ministry of Finance, will genuinely benefit salt merchants and also increase national tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Representatives Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>To Negotiate Procedures for Transporting Silver and Obtaining Permits</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, because the Ministry of Finance has regulations prohibiting the secret transport of silver,</p>
<h3>China Merchants Sze Hai Line Decides to Employ Chinese Citizens as Staff</h3>
<p>Striving for Equal Status Based on Treaty</p>
<p>Rather Abandon Passengers Going to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government requested that the China Merchants Bureau use foreign captains, chief officers, and chief engineers for the Sze Hai Line in order to obtain a passenger license. The Bureau believes this is an insult to the nation and difficult to comply with. It has already submitted a request to the Ministry, stating that Chinese crew members have already been issued licenses by the government, that the Hong Kong government has no right to examine them, and should not refuse to issue passenger licenses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporarily Employing Foreigners: When the Hai Yuan arrived in Hong Kong on its first voyage, it already had Hong Kong passengers on board. When applying for a passenger license from the Hong Kong Marine Department, the department ordered that the chief officer also be a foreigner. At the time, there was no alternative but to temporarily hire a foreigner, V. Reinburg, in Hong Kong to serve as chief officer, but only for one trip. The original chief officer, Chen Bangda, was not dismissed and was still asked to stay on board to serve. A foreigner will not be used as chief officer on the next voyage.</p>
<p>Abandoning Hong Kong Passengers: The Bureau has already appointed Ma Jiajun as captain of the Hai Ting and will also appoint Teng Shibiao as captain of the Hai Li, which will arrive in Shanghai soon. The senior crew members on the Sze Hai Line will definitely be Chinese citizens. It would rather not sell tickets to Hong Kong passengers. If the Hai Yuan Line insists on using a foreigner as chief officer, it is willing to abandon Hong Kong passengers and not take them on board, and will determine a solution after future negotiations with the government.</p>
<p>Certificates are Valid: The China Merchants Bureau has now submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications, stating that China has joined the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and has already obtained equal status in international navigation. All crew licenses issued by the Chinese government should be recognized by all countries, and the Hong Kong government has no right to examine Chinese crew members. This matter concerns international status and should be fought to the end. Before a resolution is reached, Hong Kong passengers will not be carried temporarily. The Hai Heng Sets Sail: The Hai Heng is scheduled to sail to the Jinliyuan Wharf this Saturday. It will officially clear customs next Tuesday and begin its maiden voyage to Lianyungang on Wednesday. Director Qian of the Longhai Railway Bureau has telegraphed the Bureau that there will be a grand welcoming ceremony when the ship arrives. The Railway Bureau will also present generous gifts to the Hai Heng, and order 300 servings of tea and refreshments to entertain visitors.</p>
<p>After exporting, legitimate merchants transporting silver should obtain passports. However, the passport application procedure should be the responsibility of the Chamber of Commerce to guarantee before prompt issuance to meet needs, or follow the method of transshipment of gold, with the Chamber of Commerce guaranteeing transport to Customs. Zheng Zenan, an executive committee member and chief of the finance section, has been specially dispatched to Beijing to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that Mr. Zheng left for Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Dragon Mountain Ship Owner Summoned by Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>Occasional Shelter</p>
<p>Should be Understood and Released</p>
<p>The San Bei Company's Dragon Mountain ship, traveling from Shanghai to Saigon to transport foreign rice, encountered a storm en route. It has escaped danger, as reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, the ship anchored off the coast of Taiwan to pump water and repair the ship due to water entering the front hold. Because it mistakenly stopped in a naval area, a dispute occurred, leading to the ship's owner, Lao Guan, being summoned by the Japanese navy. Yesterday afternoon, Shanghai received a telegram from the ship detailing the situation, as follows:</p>
<h3>Encountering Wind and Water</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mountain ship is slightly larger</p>
<p>than the Mount Tai. This</p>
<p>time, it departed from Shanghai to Annan Saigon</p>
<p>to transport a large quantity of foreign rice to Shanghai. On the third</p>
<p>day of this month, the ship encountered a hurricane at sea south of Sheshan. The ship's owner, Reisby, fought against the violent waves. Due to the surging waves, seawater poured over the ship's hull, causing the front hold of the ship to be</p>
<p>completely flooded. In the emergency, a rescue signal was sent. Fortunately, the hurricane passed, and the Dragon Mountain ship was able to move forward. However, due to the water entering the ship, they urgently sought to pump it out to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Stopping the Ship</h3>
<p>When the Dragon Mountain ship advanced to the Taiwan sea area, the owner deemed that the seawater entering the front hold had exceeded the water</p>
<p>line, making navigation very dangerous. He chose a safer place to anchor and ordered all crew members to carry out the work of pumping water and repairing the parts of the ship damaged by the huge waves. Unexpectedly, the location where the Dragon Mountain stopped was within the Japanese naval area stationed in Taiwan, where commercial ships were not allowed to anchor. The Dragon Mountain ship was not initially aware of this, so soon after stopping, a Japanese warship sailed over to watch the Dragon Mountain ship, causing a major dispute.</p>
<h3>Stating the Circumstances</h3>
<p>The Dragon Mountain ship's captain, Reisby, and the ship's chief engineer, were summoned for questioning by the Taiwan Japanese Naval Headquarters.</p>
<p>Reisby and others then took a Japanese warship to the Japanese fleet headquarters in Taiwan, giving a detailed account of the reason for the Dragon Mountain ship's anchoring there, with no other intention. The facts are clear and can be investigated. However, the Dragon Mountain is still anchored there.</p>
<h3>Should Be Released</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, after the San Bei Company received a wireless report from the Dragon Mountain ship's chief officer, as of yesterday, the owner and others had not returned to the ship. The work of pumping the water that entered the front hold had been carried out. The water in the front hold has now been pumped out, and the water in the rear hold is still being pumped. According to the crew's speculation, given this special situation, the Japanese naval department will surely understand and release them.</p>
<h3>Lumber Association Advocates Domestically Produced Fir</h3>
<p>Declaration Aims to Save the Nation and Merchants</p>
<p>The city's Lumber Association, after repeatedly requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry, ordering all public and private construction projects in various provinces and cities to use domestic fir wood, has been approved. Starting from January 1st of next year, it will announce and implement the minimum standard for the use of domestic fir wood, taking into account the construction conditions in various places. It is now known that the Lumber Trade Association, in order to actively promote it, in addition to making every effort to research the supply and design needs, issued a declaration to save the nation and merchants. The declaration is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has always used domestic fir wood for building materials. Moreover, domestic fir wood is strong and durable, and many buildings have stood firm and upright for hundreds of years. Looking at the ancient temples and pagodas of the world, they have undergone several dynasties and are still worthy of admiration and viewing. Although half of it is due to the hard work of the craftsmen in designing, the firmness and durability of fir wood is the main reason. After the establishment of commercial treaties, imported foreign pine was sold in the market, and fir wood was abandoned. Our industry has been hit by this until now, and it is almost in a desperate situation. The durability of foreign pine is far less than that of domestic fir wood, but it is not used in construction, causing tens of millions of dollars to flow out of the country every year, which is very painful. The flooding of foreign pine is a small harm to this industry, but a great harm to the entire country. Wandering day and night without a solution, this association had previously requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the Yuan and ministries, ordering the subordinate provincial and municipal engineering organs to implement the use of domestic fir wood as building materials, to save the country and merchants. A reply was received, approving the implementation from January 1st of the 24th year. The Municipal Bureau of Engineering has also posted a notice, outlining two minimum standards for the use of domestic fir wood. Now that the notice has been issued, it is bound to be implemented. In addition to notifying all colleagues in the industry to collect as much as possible for purchase by all sectors, this association will make every effort to study the needs of the design and will publish it in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers to promote it and save the right to benefit. Currently, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is compiling a book to revitalize industry and promote domestic goods, soliciting interviews from all public officials. We colleagues are confined to a corner and have very little experience. We have already sent letters to the lumber associations of Hankou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Wenzhou, and Fujian to inquire about detailed information, hoping to gather wisdom and benefit. I think there is no shortage of industry veterans and enthusiasts who promote domestic wood in the country. I hope to have your guidance, which I will appreciate greatly.</p>
<h3>Meeting Record of the First Special District Recruitment Team</h3>
<p>Discussing the Second Step of Work</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, the general director of the First Special District Recruitment Team of the Jiashu Quan Zhe Disaster Relief Association, yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, in order to discuss the recruitment methods of the various teams, specially borrowed the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant in the Racecourse Hall and invited the committee members of the district branches and trade associations to have dinner, including Wang Pingnan, Le Fucheng, Wang Fang, Lu Qi, Lü Baohu, Zhu Zhichun, He Pinglong, Shi Zongtang, Xi Guansheng (replaced by Zheng Xingpu), Zhao Nangong, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Zhixin, Zhang Dehou and more than 80 others. During the dinner, General Director Wu Zhihao first reported the purpose of the call, saying roughly, "This year's drought in Zhejiang is truly said to be nowhere without desolation. Millions of our Zhejiang disaster victims are crying from hunger and cold. All this we see. We all are human beings, how can we not be saddened? Inviting you to come today is not for the sake of eating. The vegetables of Sanyuantou are not worth a smile, but the disaster area is crying so loudly, how dare we be full alone? So I came to state one sentence, it is not for eating, but for donations. Speaking of the aspect of donations, the second step of work has already been done. Now we must discuss the second step. I hope that you will promote it a lot outside. Disaster relief is the duty of people, regardless of provincial origin. The matter in the east is the same as in the west, and the west is also the same. This is what I should ask you to understand. Speaking of the second step of work, please Mr. Hu Fengxiang announce it." Then Hu Fengxiang stood up and said roughly, "The various aspects that should be paid attention to for disaster relief have already been said by Mr. Zhihao. The second step of work that should be done now is to hope that you will bring a few more donation books back and strive to solicit donations in all aspects. Getting a bit more power means being able to save one more person. The reason why Mr. Zhihao borrowed the Gongdelin today is to express that your merits are immeasurable." (At this point, there was thunderous applause.)</p>
<p>), and then rushed to receive the donation books on the spot, totaling more than 220 copies. It is thought that the recruitment staff of the association is so enthusiastic, its achievements should be considerable.</p>

<h3>News from the Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association</h3>
<p>Liyang, Hai'ning, Haiyan... Decide to Add Relief Funds</p>
<p>Jiangshan, Changshan, Longyou, Deqing, Quzhou Conduct Investigations</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association on Renji Road in this city, because winter is approaching and the disaster areas are urgently awaiting relief, communicated rapidly by letters and telegrams, and held a board meeting. It was heard that the discussions resulted in the following decisions: Liyang, Jiangsu, has a severe and extensive disaster area. The original allocation of 10,000 yuan was not enough to distribute. It was approved to raise an additional 9,000 yuan. In addition, the Huaiyin Pu Hui porridge shop was approved to receive a subsidy of 1,500 yuan, and more than 200 sets of cotton clothing. For Hai'ning, Zhejiang, it was originally planned to provide disaster relief in conjunction with the Jisheng Society, with an original agreement to raise and allocate 20,000 yuan. According to reports from multiple investigators, the disaster victims are too numerous and the amount of money is too small. It was approved to raise an additional 10,000 yuan in two installments, and 2,000 sets of new cotton clothing. In addition, Haiyan originally planned to allocate 5,000 yuan in urgent relief, and now, according to the Ganpu river project relief, a request for subsidies was made. It was approved to raise an additional 5,000 yuan. As for the disaster area, because there was no food, abandoned babies were on the road. It was approved to raise an additional 2,000 yuan for adoption. In addition, according to reports from Jiangshan, Changshan, Longyou, Deqing, Quzhou, and other places in Zhejiang, the rice crops were withered and died, and the disaster victims had no way to make a living. Men and women were crying, and waiting to be fed, and were actually eating wild vegetables and bran to fill their hunger, with emaciated faces and miserable appearances. The north wind is now blowing fiercely, and they have no winter clothes. If they do not die of hunger, they will surely freeze to death from the cold, which is no different from a human hell. If they are not rescued early, they will turn into frozen corpses in a blink of an eye. The board members considered this situation to be very serious and decided to actively investigate the area. The allocated funds had been exhausted. It is hoped that all sectors will hear and rise up, develop great compassion, and find ways to raise aid, gather strength, and save countless lives.</p>

<h3>Four Members of the Communist Assassination Squad Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Kuang Huian, Zhao Xuan, Meng Huating, and Zhu Jinming All Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Lin Ermei Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment, Tang Wanxuan and Others Acquitted</p>
<p>After the Communist bandits' assassination squad was uncovered by the police, Kuang Huian and other important members of the squad were prosecuted by the police to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for repeatedly committing assassination crimes. The hearing has concluded, and a ruling is pending. The previous reports have repeatedly stated the details. Yesterday afternoon, the sentencing date arrived. Zhao, Wu, and Zhou, the three judges, together with Prosecutor Zhong, ascended the seat and ordered the ten defendants, male and female, including Kuang, to be brought forward. After a few brief questions, the verdict was announced. Kuang Huian and Zhao Xuan were each sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for the crime of forming a group with the aim of endangering the Republic of China. Each was sentenced to death for three counts of premeditated murder, and all were to be executed together. Meng Huating and Zhu Jinming committed one fewer murder than Kuang and Zhao, so they were also sentenced to death together. Lin Ermei was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for possessing military firearms and ammunition, and the firearms and ammunition were confiscated. Tang Wanxuan, Li Yangshi, Li Zhoushi, Liu Jinrong, and Zhang Lishi were all acquitted. After the verdict was announced, Attorney Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requested that all ten people be allowed to be taken to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and then returned for execution after the investigation. The Third Branch of the Higher Court also sent personnel to court to request the transfer. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, and Prosecutor Zhong, stated that if the acquitted defendants were taken away and no suspicion of committing a crime was found, they requested that the Bureau be ordered to return them quickly for release. After deliberation by the court, it was approved to hand them over to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and then return them immediately so that the Third Branch of the Higher Court could be notified to transfer them.</p>
<h3>Round-the-World Feat of Polish School Ship</h3>
<p>Can Arrive in Shanghai in Mid-March Next Year</p>
<p>The Polish school ship Pomerania, a giant three-masted sailing ship with several large sails, is also equipped with modern motor machinery inside, but it relies entirely on wind power when sailing, and the motor is kept in reserve and not used. The ship has all kinds of equipment, carrying a total of 106 officers and sailors, and 61 naval school students. It set sail from Gdynia, Poland in September, passing through the Panama Canal, Japan, Shanghai, the Suez Canal, and North Africa, etc., for a round-the-world voyage. This is the first time a Polish ship has made this feat, as the ship was donated by the people of Pomerania Province, Poland, hence the name Pomerania. According to news from the Polish Embassy in this city yesterday, the ship is scheduled to dock in Yokohama, Japan, for one or two days, and then in Nagasaki for a week for repairs, and then sail to Shanghai, arriving around mid-March next spring. The Polish community in Shanghai will hold a grand welcome at that time. After staying in Shanghai for four days, it will sail south.</p>
<h3>Hankou Road One-Way Traffic Problem</h3>
<p>Various Shops Jointly Send Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Call a Joint Meeting of Owners and Tenants</p>
<p>More than 130 shops on Hankou Road, including Ma Shanghou, recently sent a joint letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again because the Public Works Department ignored the case of requesting the cancellation of the one-way traffic system, requesting that it uphold justice and call a joint meeting of all owners and tenants on Hankou Road immediately. The original letter said: "Dear Sirs, the shops have repeatedly sent letters to the Public Works Department and requested your association and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to support them in unison because the business of the shops has been greatly affected since the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road. Recently, in compliance with the instructions in the Public Works Department's letter, we have presented to the Bureau the actual examples of the impact of the implementation of one-way traffic on Hankou Road on the various shops. The owners of the various properties on this road, such as the Taichang Real Estate Company, have also sent letters to the Bureau requesting the cancellation of this measure. The shops are confident that the Public Works Department will be able to understand the difficulties of the businesses and abolish the one-way traffic system on this road immediately. Today, we read in the November 30th newspaper that the Bureau recently held a traffic committee meeting, and there was not a single mention of the case of the shops and owners of this road requesting the cancellation of the one-way traffic system. We were very surprised. After the Public Works Department ordered the shops to disclose special proof of the closure of empty houses due to the war traffic, and when the shops proved it with actual examples, they abandoned the case. Such disregard for public reason and arbitrary actions are not what a municipal authority that takes the welfare of citizens as its principle should do. We believe that the heads of your association, who lead the merchants, are particularly concerned about the interests of the merchants and maintain them. We dare to jointly send a letter to your association requesting you to uphold justice and call a joint meeting of all owners and tenants on Hankou Road immediately to discuss response measures to maintain commerce and relieve the suffering. We eagerly await your orders. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Respectfully.

<h3>Large Fire in Zhabei During the Day</h3>
<p>Datong Road, Hengtong Road</p>
<p>Millions Worth of Houses Lost</p>
<p>At 12:40 yesterday, a fire broke out at 553 Datong Road, Zhabei, south of the railway (in the tin-roofed house facing west, belonging to Fu Shirong, a Ningbo native who runs the Chuan Baoxing bamboo shop), because of carelessly drying a quilt on the stove. The houses where Fu lived were close to the railway. At that time, the northwest wind was very strong, so the flames spread to the southeast. After the Taiyangmiao Police Station of the Xinzha Branch learned of this, it immediately called the Fire Brigade and sent a belt car to extinguish the fire. However, the wind was very strong, and in less than two hours, the fire spread to the tin-roofed and tiled bungalows on the left, right, and behind, totaling 16 shops from 527 to 559, including Liu Rongsen, Tan Xinchang, Quan Zhentai, Tan Yuchang, Yuanshengchang, Jiang Yixing, Liu Yongcheng, Sanhecheng, Yan Yongxing, Ge Shunxing, Jishengyuan, etc., new and old furniture shops. Most of the warehouses behind them were destroyed. After the investigation by Zhu Liming, Yang Jintang, and other police station chiefs, it was found that a total of 45 tin-roofed houses were destroyed, each worth 50 yuan, totaling 2,250 yuan, and 23 tiled bungalows, each worth about 200 yuan, totaling 4,600 yuan. The business assets were worth about 4,300 yuan, totaling more than 11,000 yuan in losses. The arsonist, Fu Shirong, was arrested and sent to the Xinzha Branch, which reported it to the Inspection Office of the Public Security Bureau. At 2:10, a fire alarm was reported at 36 Hengtong Road, the Wanxing cigarette and wine shop opened by Wu Junliang. Smoke filled the air, and the roof was pierced in a moment. Although fire trucks from various sections came to rescue, the fire was extinguished after 4:00. After investigation, it was learned that a total of five buildings at 36, 38, 40, 42, and 44 Hengtong Road were destroyed, with an estimated loss of more than 4,000 yuan. The arsonist, Wu Junliang, 34 years old, from Jiading, was arrested. According to Shen Taiyuan, who runs a tofu shop, a piece of oilcloth was placed on Wu Junliang's signboard, causing the fire. According to Xu Buchi and other neighbors, Wu has fire insurance of 1,500 yuan with the New World Company. Director Gong of the branch bureau is investigating the matter to find out if there are any other circumstances.</p>
<h3>China Industrial Bank Audit Results</h3>
<p>The Commercial Sector Still Has a Surplus</p>
<p>Head Office Accounts Sealed</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank went bankrupt. Manager Qin Baoyuan absconded with funds in advance. Lu Xihou, the executive director of the Qunyi Syndicate bearing the economic responsibility for the bank, and the new manager Lu Mengxiang, etc., were prosecuted by the police. Because Lu Xihou had co-founded the International Jockey Club with a certain Westerner in the summer, spending a large sum of money, but the authorities did not approve the registration, causing the club to disappear without a trace. The funds spent on purchasing horses and hiring jockeys, etc., were supposedly advanced by the bank. A request was made to send personnel to audit the accounts. The First Special District Local Court appointed two accountants, Xu Yongzuo, etc., to audit all the accounts. The day before yesterday, after the court examined the proposals of Lu et al., it ruled that the criminal part of the case be adjourned for further hearing. Thereupon, civil judges, responding to the request for liquidation from Lu et al., investigated Lu Xihou and Lu Mengxiang, ordering them to immediately provide a list of assets and debts, so that personnel could be dispatched to handle the liquidation. This has been detailed in our newspaper. It is now known that all new and old account books of the bank and the head office were, according to accountant Xu, sealed by the police when he was instructed to audit the accounts, so he could only audit those that had not been seized. The audit results showed that the commercial sector of the bank owed 449,303.34 yuan, while 563,862.60 yuan was owed to the bank. The two offset each other, leaving a surplus. However, the savings sector owed 498,151.75 yuan, while 74,640.47 yuan was owed to the sector. The two offset each other with a significant deficit. When the commercial and savings sectors were combined, the statistical difference was more than 300,850 yuan. According to the accountant's report, 233,965.73 yuan of this difference was owed by the head office. Because the accounts of the head office were still sealed, there was no way to investigate, and the nature and use of the shortage were unknown. In addition, 74,986.29 yuan was used for renting land and building houses at the Nanjing Road branch, and for purchasing equipment for the Foch Road branch on the Tianzhu Church Street in the South City, as well as for the start-up costs of various branches, stamp paper fees, etc. Although the International Jockey Club had a current account, the audit report did not mention it, as Lu Xihou stated, the funds had been cleared. Now, in order to thoroughly understand the bank's accounts, the court intends to issue a warrant, ordering the police to send all the seized account books of the head office to the court, so that the appointed liquidator can conduct a detailed review. The truth will surely come to light in the near future.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Unlicensed Charter Cars</h3>
<p>Nearly Two Hundred People Fined</p>
<p>Each Fined One Yuan</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau's Vehicle Department has observed that the number of unlicensed charter cars on various streets has been increasing daily. The drivers of these cars spend the entire day with a car in hand, soliciting passengers arbitrarily on the roads, which is even more detestable than ordinary rickshaws. This seriously obstructs traffic and affects road administration. Therefore, a crackdown method has been planned. All legitimate charter cars that are not unlicensed must submit a receipt when applying for a license fee. When the owner is out with a car, he should hand over this arm badge to the driver to wear on his arm. Unlicensed charter cars will not be given arm badges for identification. This will be implemented on the first of this month. The police authorities have issued a notice to all Chinese and foreign detectives in all police stations to pay attention during their duties. If a driver pulling a charter car is found without an arm badge,</p>
<p>He will be immediately detained. As a result, it has become difficult for general unlicensed charter car drivers to pass off as licensed. In recent days, those who have been detained and punished are already numerous. The number of detentions by each police station the day before yesterday was particularly high. Among them, the Old Gate and Central Police Stations, due to the diligent inspection by Chinese Deputy Head Lu Dagong and others, achieved good results. After these drivers were detained at the police station, each was required to deposit one yuan in cash as bail for release. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court for trial. After questioning by the criminal court judge, each was fined one yuan. After this strict crackdown, unlicensed charter cars may disappear from the streets.</p>
<h3>A Scrubbing Brush Claims a Life</h3>
<p>Mother Suspects Daughter of Hiding It on Purpose</p>
<p>Daughter Commits Suicide in Resentment</p>
<p>Gong Shen, a woman from Haimen, 22 years old, her husband Gong Aqing, a cotton merchant, and her mother Shen Shi, etc., lived together at No. 13 Rongli, Tianbao Road, Zhabei. The family was usually harmonious. But the day before yesterday, Shen Shi intended to wash clothes and had placed a scrubbing brush. At this moment, she suddenly could not find it anywhere and suspected that her daughter had deliberately hidden it. She immediately began to scold her. Although her niece tried to defend her, she was ultimately not understood by her mother. Therefore, she alone went to the bedroom and hanged herself when no one was around. By the time her mother discovered it, it was too late for regret. She immediately called her son-in-law to help her take her down, but she was already barely breathing. She was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but to no avail, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the Xinza Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then transported to the Feren Road Morgue for autopsy. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Tang, along with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., to come to the morgue to examine the body. After identifying the body, and after hearing the previous account from the deceased's husband, Gong Aqing, Prosecutor Tang ruled that the deceased, Gong Shen, female, had indeed died by hanging herself before death. The body was handed over to her husband, Gong Aqing, for coffining and burial with a signed statement.</p>
<h3>Wu Peizhen Requests a Divorce from Her Deaf-Mute Husband</h3>
<p>| Rescheduled for Further Hearing at 2 PM on the 15th</p>
<p>Chen Wu Peizhen, a local young woman, sued her husband Chen Senlin (who is deaf and mute) in the Local Court through lawyer Yang Changchi for severe injury from poisoning and abandonment, requesting a divorce, compensation for damages, and the return of dowry ornaments. The grounds for the divorce were that her husband's temperament was fierce, he often beat her, and he had affairs. He would only return late at night. On the morning of August 30 this year, she attempted suicide by jumping into the river, but was rescued. She has been hospitalized in Nanyang Hospital for many days, but no one from her husband's family has visited her, which is truly a sign of broken affection, etc. The defendant, Chen Senlin, hired lawyer Lu Qi to defend him and filed a counterclaim, requesting that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. It was found that the plaintiff was born out of wedlock. Her own father and legal mother used to run a lime business in Shanghai, but have returned to their hometown for many years. At the time of the engagement, the matchmaker stated that because the other party (mother and daughter) did not want to live in the countryside and were helpless in Shanghai, they only needed to be provided with food and clothing and did not seek a high match.</p>
<h3>Aid Patriotic Martyrs Association Sends Representatives to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Requesting Amnesty for Liu Chongwu, etc., to Console Public Sentiment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Aid Patriotic Martyrs Association, considering that the Fifth Plenary Session will open on the tenth of this month, and in order to petition the session to request an explicit amnesty for patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Cao Songshou, Tian Yongyang, etc., has appointed representatives Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Peide, Wang Jingdong, etc., five people in total, who will take the night express train to Beijing tonight to petition the session, the Central Political Council, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, etc., requesting that amnesty be granted to console public sentiment. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Petitioning in Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>The Aid Patriotic Martyrs Association believes that patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, etc., committed offenses in the 21st year of the Republic out of indignation at the shamelessness of treacherous merchants. A moment of passionate impulse led them to issue warnings, resulting in their being caught in the legal net. Although various legal groups in this city have repeatedly petitioned the authorities requesting amnesty, it has not been granted. Unfortunately, Pan Hongsheng died due to excessive punishment, and the martyrs in prison have no release date. As things stand, their grievances cannot be redressed. Now that the Fifth Plenary Session will open on December 10th, in order to request the session to explicitly grant amnesty, a general meeting of representatives from various organizations was convened on November 18th. Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Peide, Wang Jingdong, etc., five people were appointed as representatives to take the petition to Beijing and separately petition the Fifth Plenary Session, the National Government, the Central Political Council, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, etc. It is now known that the representatives, due to the proximity of the session, have specifically decided to take the night express train to Beijing tonight to petition, and will also contact various legal groups in Beijing to jointly appeal to the authorities, striving to achieve their goal.</p>
<h3>Request for Amnesty</h3>
<p>Request regarding patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, whose cases have been sent back by the Supreme Court for retrial but have still been sentenced to heavy penalties, requesting approval of amnesty to uphold the national spirit and console the people. In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic, patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, etc., were indignant at the enemy's merchants engaging in communication with the enemy, the dumping of enemy goods, the decline of national goods, and the despair of the people's livelihood. Rather than sit and wait for death, they rose up to seek survival. Therefore, they disregarded everything and used various methods to issue stern warnings to treacherous merchants. Their motives were entirely out of patriotism. The martyrs deeply felt that the quantity of enemy goods flooding the market was directly proportional to the strength of the enemy and inversely proportional to the strength of our country. The flood of enemy goods and the surge in import surplus caused outrage to anyone with a conscience. However, since diplomatic relations had not been severed, there was no way to impose legal sanctions on the treacherous merchants who pursued profit, and warning behavior could not avoid being restricted by legal provisions. (Omitted section)... It is found that if this case is observed solely from the surface of the actions, it is indeed not permitted by law. However, the victimized treacherous merchants and the defendants had no prior acquaintance and no grievances. The warning action also did not provide any benefit for the defendants. It was only because the treacherous merchants traded in enemy goods, harming the interests of the entire country and the entire nation, and the national law did not punish such evil people, that the defendants stepped forward to engage in a private fight with treacherous national traitors. Their purpose was to uphold the interests of the country and the nation, with absolutely no other. Now, people who uphold the interests of the country and the nation have been imprisoned for a long time, while treacherous merchants who engage in private interests and harm the country are protected by law. How can this comfort the national spirit and promote justice? The city's Bar Association, seeing this, suggested to the Ministry of Judicial Administration in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic that a separate jury court be set up to hear cases where the motive was patriotism but the law was violated. Although it was approved, it was not implemented. Recently, Pan Hongsheng died in prison from illness caused by grief and resentment. The remaining Liu Chongwu, Tian Shuiyang, Cao Songshou, etc., are also facing the danger of following in Pan Hongsheng's footsteps. The representatives of various organizations present, after consultation and unanimous agreement, specially appointed representatives to jointly implore approval of amnesty. The country is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. Respectfully presented, (omitted below).</p>
<p>A strip of armband will be issued along with the license, and the car owner is ordered to hand this armband to the driver to wind around his arm when taking the car out. Unlicensed charter cars will not be given armbands for identification. This will be implemented on the first of this month. The police authorities have issued a notice to all Chinese and foreign detectives in all police stations to pay attention during their duties. If a driver pulling a charter car is found without an armband,</p>
<p>He will be immediately detained. As a result, it has become difficult for general unlicensed charter car drivers to pass off as licensed.

<h3>Murdered Male Corpse Found on Desolate Land on Fulu Road</h3>
<p>Looks like a Villager, Murdered and Then Body Moved to the Spot</p>
<p>A Card with Shi Zhaolan's Name Was Found in His Pocket</p>
<p>West Police Officer No. 209 and West Police Officer No. 106 of the French Concession Foch Police Station, while patrolling Fulu Road at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, discovered an unidentified male corpse that had been hacked to death on the desolate land behind No. 18 Fude Lane. He was approximately 30 years old, with his head facing northeast and his feet facing southwest, lying supine on the ground. He was wearing a melon-skin cap, a black cloth cotton robe, black cloth-lined trousers, black foreign socks, and black cloth-faced cloth-bottomed Duzuo shoes. His clothes were already worn and old, resembling a villager from Jiangbei. His left neck appeared to have been chopped with an axe, with a wound approximately half an inch deep. There were two small knife holes in the back of his head. The West Police Officers immediately reported to the police station, and Chinese and foreign detectives went to investigate. A card was found in his pocket, with only the three characters "Shi Zhaolan" and nothing else. Judging by the situation, it appeared that he had been murdered and then abandoned here. The body was immediately transported by car to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for autopsy. A report was sent to the Second Special Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with a forensic doctor, a clerk, etc., to come to the morgue at noon to examine the body. As no family members of the deceased were found, the official instructed that the body be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and burial, pending identification by family members. The French Concession Police Department was also instructed to notify all detectives on duty to investigate and arrest the murderer for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Family Dispute Over the Estate of the Deceased Owner of Ren Changtai Candle Shop</h3>
<p>Friends' Mediation Falls Short</p>
<p>Ren Changtai Incense and Candle Shop, next to Hongmiao on Nanjing Road, was opened by Huang Xunhua, a native of Zhenhai, Ningbo. In addition to the Hongmiao shop, Huang also had Ren Changtai branches on Chongqing Road and at the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession. His legal wife, Huang Hua Caiqin, and their son, Huang Yongchuan, lived in the Chongqing Road branch, while his concubine, Chu Yuzhuo, and his adopted daughter, Huang Hanqing, lived in the Eight Immortals Bridge branch. This state of affairs had been going on for years. Because the business of both the main and branch stores was good, yielding substantial profits annually, the family lived comfortably and could usually get along peacefully. In September of this year, Huang Xunyao died of illness, leading to a dispute between the wife and concubine over the division of the estate. Friends such as Bai Liewu had made every effort to mediate and proposed a settlement. The attitude of both parties had shown signs of softening. Those acting as Lu Zhonglian were happy that the dispute could be resolved. Unexpectedly, the effort fell short because the issue of Chu Yuzhuo's status was once again fiercely debated. Chu, in her capacity as the legal guardian of her daughter Hanqing, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Huang Hua Caiqin and her fourteen-year-old son Huang Yongchuan in the First Special District Local Court for the division of the estate. She claimed that when Huang Xunhua married her, he said he had no wife. Only after they were married did she learn that Xunhua had a wife. She argued with him, and Xunhua agreed to treat her as "both heads of the family". Now that her husband had passed away, all the property was in the hands of the defendant. She requested that the court order the defendant to hand over her share, which amounted to more than 38,000 yuan. The court summoned them previously, but the case was postponed due to the defendant's absence. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao held a court session. The defendant also hired lawyer Li Cishan to appear in court. In addition to responding to the plaintiff's lawsuit, Xu also filed a counterclaim, requesting an order for Chu to hand over the Eight Immortals Bridge branch to Huang Hua Caiqin for management. He also stated that this case could have been resolved peacefully and requested that the plaintiff be persuaded to settle. Judge Qiao granted a three-week postponement, directing both parties to conduct settlement negotiations outside the court. If no settlement was reached by the deadline, they would be summoned again.</p>
<h3>Cold Weather Prompts Social Affairs Bureau to Help the Poor</h3>
<p>Shelters Set Up in the South of Shanghai</p>
<p>Soup Kitchens Planned in Zhabei</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing that the cold weather has caused hardship for the general poor, who have nowhere to seek shelter, has selected the Huzhou Guild Hall in the south of Shanghai and the Chao-Hui Villa on Xietu Road to set up shelters. In Zhabei, charitable organizations will set up soup kitchens. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shelters: According to officials of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the bureau, together with the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association, has set up the first shelter in the Chaozhou Guild Hall. The shelter began accepting the poor on the first of this month. As of today, the number of people sheltered has reached more than 500. The second shelter has been selected at the Chao-Hui Villa on Xietu Road. The buildings there are spacious, enough to accommodate two to three thousand people. However, because the Security Department's communications team was originally stationed there, the Social Affairs Bureau consulted with Director Yang and requested that they relocate. Director Yang agreed to relocate as soon as a suitable building was found. As soon as the communications team moves out, acceptance can begin. The expenses of both shelters, in addition to being planned by charitable organizations, have also been approved by the municipal government for an allocation of 3,000 yuan to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants in Singapore Plan to Open a National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Representative Huang Manshi Returns Home to Negotiate</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Talked About How Overseas Chinese Welcome National Products</p>
<p>Huang Manshi, the representative of the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, returned to China to investigate national products and negotiate the opening of a national products exhibition. He arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and Beijing yesterday. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited him at his lodging and received a detailed account. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Preparing to Open an Exhibition: The total population of Singapore is more than 440,000, of which Chinese people account for approximately 330,000, accounting for three-quarters. Businesses there are mostly operated by Chinese, and the consumption of goods is also mostly by Chinese. Although overseas Chinese live in foreign countries, their love for their country is very ardent. During the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the donations from overseas Chinese there were very large. They are particularly eager to use national products. However, due to the lack of national products in the area, they cannot purchase them. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, deeply aware of this, is preparing to hold a national products exhibition there and promote the sale of national products.</p>
<p>Returning Home to Negotiate the Collection of Goods: Huang was specially dispatched on the 6th of last month to return to China with the tasks of (1) investigating national products in our country, (2) negotiating the opening of an exhibition, with the aim of promoting the sale of national products. After arriving in Shanghai, he will go to Beijing to report to Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and negotiate the opening of a national products exhibition. Minister Chen was very supportive and willing to assist. He will also go to Tianjin and Beijing to solicit national products from various national products organizations to be transported to Singapore to participate in the exhibition. The results were very satisfactory. After returning to Shanghai, he will visit the Chinese Industrial Federation, the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and other organizations to negotiate.</p>
<p>Exhibition Focuses on Promotion: Various national products organizations are preparing</p>
<p>To participate in the Manila Exhibition of the Carnival, and have decided to take this opportunity to divide the national products for participation into two parts: one part to participate in the Carnival, and one part to participate in the Singapore Exhibition. The date for the opening of the National Products Exhibition will be decided after the Carnival closes. It is called an exhibition, but it is actually a promotion. At that time, the organizations formed by various national products industrial and commercial firms participating will send representatives to go, and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will send staff to assist in the exhibition and promotion. The expenses can also be saved, and language barriers can be avoided, as the local dialects are mainly from Fujian and Guangdong provinces.</p>
<p>Foreign Goods Compete with the Exhibition: The British, in view of the dumping of Japanese goods,</p>
<p>Held British goods exhibitions in Singapore twice last year and this year. Last year, 75 industrial and commercial firms participated, and this year, 144 industrial and commercial firms participated. It is planned to hold it once a year, and next year it will be expanded to 300 industrial and commercial firms. Overseas Chinese there hope that our country's national products exhibition will be held. Also, this year an American merchant brought Chinese goods to Singapore for exhibition, which was suspected by overseas Chinese. Why should national products be promoted by foreigners instead of finding ways themselves to benefit foreigners?</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Eagerly Hope for Realization: Now, overseas Chinese all hope that the national</p>
<p>Products exhibition will be realized soon, bringing glory to our country's national products and giving overseas Chinese a good impression. Therefore, Huang's return to Shanghai this time will include visiting various emerging industrial factories in the country and investigating our country's national products in order to promote them upon his return. After the negotiations are completed, he will return to Singapore from Shanghai and make preparations for holding it on a fixed date.</p>
<p>Soup Kitchens: As for Zhabei, charitable organizations have decided</p>
<p>To set up a soup kitchen at the original site of the Second Soup Kitchen on Liuying Road to provide porridge. However, the issue of funding has not been adequately resolved. Therefore, the charitable organizations will convene a board meeting within a few days to discuss raising funds. Once the funds have been discussed and decided, the soup kitchen will be set up immediately to help the poor.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Publishes "The National Goods Bridge" and "Trademark Compilation"</h3>
<p>Two Monumental Works on National Goods Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce has always paid close attention to matters such as investigating, introducing, and promoting national goods. In recent years, it has received numerous requests daily from overseas Chinese chambers of commerce and chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities to inquire about the names and trademarks of national goods manufacturers. Therefore, it was decided that the Chamber's Commodity Exhibition Hall would compile a book called "The National Goods Bridge" for reference. At the same time, regarding trademarks, in addition to the previously sold "Japanese Trademark Compilation," a "East Asian Trademark Compilation" has recently been released, bringing together a comprehensive collection of Japanese and Chinese commodity trademarks. The above two books are valuable publications for the national goods industry and the business community. The contents of the two books are described below:</p>
<p>Newly Compiled "The National Goods Bridge"</p>
<p>The first edition of "The National Goods Bridge" was published in 1925, and a revised edition was published in 1930. The materials used at that time included five items: product name, trademark, factory name, place of manufacture, and issuing organization, categorized for easy reference. Readers often referred to it as a national goods directory. Now, because the Chinese people's perception of national goods is more profound than before, starting with this edition, in addition to the original items, all information about the factory is added, such as capital, establishment date, manager's name, telegraph, and telephone numbers. The content is divided into seventeen categories: (1) Textile and Dyeing, (2) Clothing and Ornaments, (3) Food and Beverages, (4) Household Goods, (5) Travel Goods, (6) Miscellaneous Daily Necessities, (7) Construction, (8) Education, (9) Toys, (10) Hygiene, (11) Cosmetics, (12) Rubber Products, (13) Industrial Raw Materials, (14) Electrical Machinery and Appliances, (15) Machinery, (16) Miscellaneous Handicrafts, and (17) Tobacco and Alcohol. It includes the products of more than 2,000 national goods factories, first listing Shanghai and then other ports. The national goods listed are limited to those that meet the national goods standards announced by the Ministry of Industry in 1932. The book is printed in fine Tianzhang Daolin paper in a thick volume, priced at five real silver jiao per copy. Any formal national goods organizations and institutions with official letters can obtain a copy from the Chamber's Commodity Exhibition Hall by enclosing five fen for postage.</p>
<p>"East Asian Trademark Compilation"</p>
<p>This book collects all registered and approved Chinese and Japanese trademarks from the establishment of the Trademark Bureau in 1912 up to December 31, 1932, including those registered and approved by the former National Registration Bureau and the Trademark Bureau, as well as those registered and approved by the former Beijing Trademark Bureau. It includes 70 categories for China, with 1,672 pages, and 67 categories for Japan, with 856 pages, totaling more than 3,500 pages and containing over 10,000 kinds of goods. It brings together a comprehensive collection of Japanese and Chinese trademarks, comparing them by category for easy inspection. It also includes the new and old trademark laws, implementing regulations, registration instructions, and application forms, making it a valuable reference for lawyers, accountants, and the industrial sector. The entire book is finely printed by the Zhonghua Book Company in a thick volume with Western binding, priced at fifteen silver dollars. It is sold by the general and branch stores of the Zhonghua Book Company in various provinces and cities, the dispatch office of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, and the publishing department of the Xinsheng News Agency at No. 9 Chongde Lane, Simalu, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Yellow Society to Hold Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Southeast Touring Exhibition organized by the Zhejiang Construction Department pays great attention to the construction, scenery, and places of interest in the five provinces. It invited celebrities from the literary and art circles to visit and publicize them this spring. Huangshan Mountain, a famous historical site, has been a place for general men of letters to admire, chant, copy, and paint since its development in the Tang Dynasty. Painters such as Mei Qushan, Shi Hongren, and Shi Tao have all gained great fame for writing about Huangshan scenery. The wonder of the scenery is like a fairyland. In May of this year, Ye Xianyu, Zhong Shan Yin, Ma Guoliang, Lang Jingshan, Chen Jiazhen, Chen Wanli, Xu Tianzhang, Luo Gusun, and Shao Yuxiang, photographers from major newspapers and magazines in Shanghai, were invited by the Zhejiang Construction Department to visit Huangshan. Ye and others then initiated the Yellow Society to promote art and publicize Huangshan's scenic spots. At this time, films and paintings were taken, totaling more than a thousand pieces. In order to share this with the people of Shanghai, a selection of several hundred pieces will be exhibited at the address of the YMCA in Baxianqiao for three days starting from the 15th of this month. Tickets will be sold for one jiao each, and all proceeds will be donated to the YMCA's Christmas children's party gifts.</p>
<h3>Xie Fuchu Organizes Overseas Chinese Industry Investigation Delegation</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Xie Fuchu previously summoned wealthy overseas Chinese merchants from the Dutch East Indies to return to China to organize an industry investigation delegation to conduct on-site investigations in the northwest, southwest, and inland provinces, in order to invest in various undertakings. The organization had been completed, and it was originally scheduled to gather in Shanghai and prepare to depart. However, he was hospitalized due to illness, and the delegation's work was suspended. Xie was ill for two months and has just been discharged from the hospital. According to him, "I am familiar with many overseas Chinese at home and abroad. The motive for organizing this overseas Chinese industry investigation delegation is that, after the loss of the Northeast, there is no way to survive without developing the Northwest. People with insight share this view, and overseas Chinese also have a strong patriotic enthusiasm. In recent years, they have been oppressed by the governments of their places of residence and are also very willing to return to China to invest and develop industries. Therefore, everyone agreed after consultation. Moreover, this delegation has already been organized and cannot be disbanded due to my illness. Although a small number of overseas Chinese are hesitant due to fear of the cold weather in the interior, I will strongly persuade them and actively proceed to ensure that we depart as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association's Fundraising for Disaster Relief Achieves Great Success</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association in this city has recently been paying attention to disaster relief in various provinces, and various charitable organizations have also been raising funds for emergency relief. The association's area is located in the commercial center of Shanghai. Even though the market is depressed, it is obligatory to donate to disaster relief. However, because the association and its members know each other well, fundraising is easier. It is more effective to ask them to contribute than to ask outsiders. Therefore, a fundraising committee for emergency relief in disaster areas of various provinces was specially organized, with Wu Zhihao, Wang Lianfang, Sun Wenyi, Ji Jiannan, and 25 other members elected as committee members. They set off in five groups yesterday from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM to solicit donations from Sincere, Wing On, The Sun, and other major companies, Shanghai and China national goods companies, Ningbo, Siming, Quan Gong, Women's, and other banks, and Sanyou Society, Family Industry Society, and other national goods manufacturers. More than 3,000 yuan has already been obtained. They will continue to set off today. Those who pledge donations will post a notice at their door saying "Donations for Disaster Areas in Various Provinces Have Been Pledged." The money will be sent directly to the Siming Savings Society for collection. Once the campaign is over, the committee will allocate the funds to various loan groups and then publish the results in the newspaper for verification.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Robbery Case Transferred</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 21st of last month, at around 9:00 AM, the Shanghai Bank sent personnel to deliver 5,200 yuan to the savings office of Jiaotong University on Haig Road in the French Concession. It was robbed on the way. Chen Goudi, Zhang Zilong, and eight other criminals were arrested by the Yulin Road Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chen and the other criminals to the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that this case should be transferred to the Second Special Court for trial. However, defendant Zhang Ganlong, at 3:30 AM on October 27, gathered three accomplices and robbed the home of Gong Guochen, a local resident at No. 1846 Xinzha Road, of property worth 416 yuan. The victim identified the defendant at the police station as being present at the robbery. Please handle this case strictly. Gong Guochen and his wife, Xu, testified that the defendant was holding a pistol at the time. Zhang Zilong's confession was evasive. Judge Bi Xiaofen sentenced Zhang Zilong to seven years in prison. The number of days of detention before the final judgment was commuted to one day of imprisonment for every two days. The French police sent a letter from Chinese detective Yang Yilong, requesting a transfer. The court asked each defendant about their age and place of origin. After a brief review, the court ordered that Chen Goudi, Tan Jinbiao, Yao Sheng, Huang Shun, Zhang Zilong, Zhou, A Mei, and Zhu Xuelong be transferred to the Second Special District of Shanghai for trial.</p>

<p>Germany's Greatest War Film</p>
<h3>"Storm Troopers" to be Screened in Shanghai</h3>
<p>With Chinese Subtitles</p>
<p>"Storm Troopers" is a major German war film. The film is purely a performance of the truth of war, does not tell a story, and is all about the terrible situation of the front lines and trenches. The realism of the filming is shocking. During the filming of this film, a total of 30,000 pounds of gunpowder and eight tons of explosives were used. The amount is enough to turn the entire city of Shanghai into powder. The actors in the film are all soldiers who personally participated in the war, specially hired by the film company's manager. Therefore, the various sections performed are incomparable to general actors in love films. There are explosions of large grenade launchers, continuous artillery fire, fireballs all over the ground, as bright as electricity, and all destruction is clearly revealed. When shells enter the ground, they immediately form huge holes. Soldiers hiding in trenches are immediately destroyed and fly into the air. The most essential part is when the enemy's tanks drive into the German lines and use their huge power to wreak all kinds of destruction. Behind the tanks, enemy soldiers swarm forward, and machine guns fire, as dense as firecrackers, with the dead lying everywhere. Finally, the tanks are destroyed by artillery fire. The tension of the plot is something we have not yet witnessed. In addition, the film company has spared no expense to include Chinese subtitles in the film, which is also unprecedented for foreign films. There is very little dialogue in the film. Everything is clear on the screen. The film will be named "Storm Troopers" and will be screened in Shanghai soon. It is expected that its success will not be less than when it was shown in Europe.</p>
<h3>Great Sales of Red-Label Special-Price Goods at the Daxin National Silk and Satin Bureau</h3>
<p>The Daxin National Silk and Satin Bureau on Simmalu and Shilou has been holding a winter sale since yesterday. In addition to selling various exquisite domestic products at a 10% discount, it is also selling ten kinds of special-price goods at low prices marked with red labels. People from all walks of life consider the bureau to be a general organization that completely promotes domestic products and has no concerns about passing off foreign goods as domestic goods. In order to clarify the competitive reality of improved domestic silk and satin, domestic silk factories have rushed to display their latest products, so that those who love domestic silk and satin can have the opportunity to see them first. Yesterday was the first day of the bureau's winter sale, and business was extremely crowded. Sales of red-label special-price goods were particularly smooth. Because the bureau complied with the association's decision and did not mark the actual price of the discounted goods in the advertisement, the price was indeed unexpectedly low. It is estimated that yesterday's sales were strongest for electric crepe, fragrant crepe, colored wool gabardine, and various soft satins.</p>
<h3>Yaopuer New Leap Electric Stove</h3>
<p>The various electric light bulbs and electric fans produced by the China Yaopuer Electric Appliance Factory are of high quality, solid materials, power-saving, and durable, and have long been popular. It is heard that the factory has newly produced a kind of electric stove, with a novel form, which has never been seen in China. Its heat can spread around, the power is about 2,700 watts. Because the manufacturing method is particularly fine, it consumes very little power. If one is placed in a room, the joy of gathering around the stove for warmth will be harmonious. It is expected that this product will go without saying once it is released.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Publishes a Compilation of Constitutions of Various Countries</h3>

<h3>The Sixth Day of the National Labor Exhibition</h3>
<p>57 Groups of Visitors, Over 5,000 People</p>
<p>The General Assembly Decides to Extend the Exhibition by Two Days to the 12th</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) The National Vocational Education and Labor Exhibition has decided to extend the exhibition by two days. 6th Printed tickets were distributed by the Nanjing YMCA for various circles to visit on the 11th and 12th. In the past, the Ministry of Education issued tickets, which were biased towards various circles in the north of the city. Now, they are biased towards the south of the city. On the 6th, 57 schools and groups in Kyoto visited, with more than 5,500 people.</p>
<p>Audience Comments on the Labor Exhibition</p>
<p>The National Labor Exhibition has been open for six days. There are many visitors. The venue has a comment book for people to comment on. The following are excerpts from the comments:</p>
<p>Looking at the products in the whole venue, except for a few vocational schools with special characteristics, the products of other primary and secondary schools are mostly the same and cannot reflect the local raw material production and industrial characteristics, which is a pity. (Zhang Yunhe) Each place and school has its own specialties. It is commendable for primary and secondary schools to have these [I&gt;</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Visits the Labor Exhibition and Takes a Photo</h3>

<p>achievements. (Yang Zongxiu) A year ago, it was impossible to see the achievements of national defense models displayed in various exhibitions. Today, I see the living tools of the 20th century, and I can't help but be pleased with the future of China. (Zeng Zou) All the works are done, but there are too few inventions and creations, which seems to be a pity. (Jiang Tianqing) The village is now in China, and only production can save it. The results of this time are very good, but there is a lack of creativity, which seems to be a pity. (Wu Tingzuo) Building the country and educating the people is here, and revitalizing the culture is here. (Respectfully read Dean Dai's question ceremony pavilion inscription as a view, Shen Zhongyu). Fortunately, the authorities are catching up and working hard to advocate for the foundation of our country's livelihood. Do not waste the talent again. (Liu Binglun) The model of Nanjing's recovery of lost land and the National Defense Museum of Shanghai's Xiaochi are quite nationalistic. (Zeng Weiyuan) This event should be held often in the future, but it should be mechanized, chemicalized, and practical. (Xu Guanghan) Most of the works are models, and there are very few practical ones. (Even if there are a few that can be practical, the crops are all young.) But from this, we can also see that people's thinking has turned to industrial production. I hope the education authorities will guide them step by step and make the scholars pay attention to the reality, and do not make them happy on the surface. Most of the products are decorations for aristocratic families. (Mou Shouqin) The current labor is the previous handicraft. In the future, the teaching of schools and factories will increase in value because of this. (Zhong Chenmin) Although the various products of this labor exhibition have not been able to gather the elites of the country, the thoughts and talents of our people have proved to be no less than those of the world. Among the products of various ethnic groups, the machinery products of Hebei and Shandong provinces and the small steam boiler of the China Vocational School are the most important needs of our country at present. If the central government can promote the establishment of factories and manufacturing to avoid the invasion of imported goods, it is also a matter of urgency to save our country's crisis. (Yang Xinfang) I am happy and sincere, and there is no hypocrisy. (Chen Chunyi) Looking at all the achievements, most of them are handicraft products. In the future, we should actively advocate machine industry, and education is enough to coexist with various countries in the world of scientific competition. (Long Guang) The author gathers the elites of the country. (Ye Chucang) The spinning machine invented by Mr. Han Lisheng is very ingenious and is indeed the creation of our country. (Wei Lianfang) The excellent points are too numerous to mention, and they are all the crystallization of the hard work of teachers and students in each school. If all the students in the country can practice what they preach, why is it that graduation is unemployment? (Qian Yiquan) The metaphysical is called the Tao, and the physical is called the art. If the Tao is important, the art is light, and if the art is important, the Tao is light. I strongly advocate that the Tao and the art are equally important (Wu Fochian) I hope for a long-term exhibition. (Fu Xuehai) Adding various craft achievements for browsing is not the way to improve in the future. (Huang Qishan) Although the entire achievement is a collection of art districts from all over the country in one hall, the products made are just so-so. I admire it very much. If it is truly from the students' instincts, then the revitalization of China's industry is not far away. (Zhou Li)</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Principals' Meeting</h3>
<p>Director Zhou of the Department of Education Talks About the Current Situation of Education in Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>On the morning of the 5th, the 23rd Second Plenary Meeting of Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Principals was held at Zhenjiang Normal School. In the afternoon, the principals attended a discussion meeting with Director Zhou Fohai of the Department of Education at the Department. In the evening at 6 o'clock, Zhou hosted a banquet for the principals at the Department. The general situation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Principals: Chen Shu (Suzhou Women's Normal School), Wu Xue (Wu Jie Normal School), Jiang Xuezhu (Songjiang Girls' Middle School), Yu Yu (Xuzhou Women's Normal School), An Shifeng (Yi Nong Agricultural School), Li Jianqing (Yunhe Township Normal School), Xu Jidun (Ruzhou Normal School), Cao Zhongquan (Donghai Normal School), Gu Kebin (Tai Cang Normal School), Zheng Pijiang (Women's Sericulture School), Peng Weiji (Changzhou Middle School), Xue Tianyou (Songjiang Vocational Middle School), Teng Shisong (Huangdu Township Normal School), Cao Chu (Suzhou Normal School), Zhang Jinan (Suqian Vocational School), Li Weizhang (Huaiyin Agricultural School), Tang Zhicai (Suzhou Agricultural School), Zhang Chuqing (Wusong Fisheries School), Wang Gang (Lianyungang Fisheries School), Sun Kui Jun (Zhang Bin acting for Nanjing Middle School), Sun Jiehuang (Wei Normal School), Sun Weizhan (Huaian Middle School), Zheng Xigu (Shangzhong School), Wu Hailou (Shihu Township Normal School), Wang Shipin (Tongzhou Middle School), Wu Wudi (Suzhou Middle School), Deng Bangdi (Suzhou Industrial School), Yan Yaofan (Xuzhou Middle School), Zhou Yigeng (Wuxi Normal School), Wu Dezhang (Yancheng Vocational School), Zhou Hushu (Yangzhou Middle School), Liu Hengjing (Nanjing Girls' Middle School), Jin Shuqiao (Wu Township Normal School), Zhang Cheng (Nanjing Middle School), Huang Zhitian (Qixia Township Normal School), Chairman Tang Zhicai, Recorder Cao Chu,</p>
<p>Matters for Discussion: 1. How should the Department's order to change the centralized military training makeup class method for the first grade be changed so that there is no difficulty? Resolution: State the following difficulties to the Department: (1) The second and third grades will be affected by the military training makeup class for graduation; (2) The female nurses have less training time and it is enough to cope with it. If they are concentrated with the boys, the girls' studies will inevitably be wasted; (3) The pre-determined makeup class method has been implemented in each school, and it is changed again at this time. There is a defense against the school's reputation, and the following suggestions are made: Please ask the General Inspectorate of Training to set the military training time for the first, second, and third grades of high school for 2 hours each, and hold a general exercise for one month in June of the last year. 2. The Department of Education issued a standard for inspecting the physical, chemical, and biological equipment of secondary schools. Should the association first collect statistics on the existing equipment of each school and submit them to the Department for reference in the allocation of temporary expenses in the 24th year? Resolution: Please pay attention to the balanced development of each school and make overall arrangements. 3. The training class for teachers should ask the association to submit a resolution to the Department of Education to stipulate the method. Resolution: Passed. 4. The province is currently handling land reports, and schools are no exception. In the future, schools will have to pay land price tax. Please ask the Department of Education to include the land price tax in the budget according to the size of the school area, or ask the Department of Finance to exempt the taxes payable by the provincial education agencies. Resolution: Please include it in the 24th year budget. 5. How to promote the graduates of agricultural schools? Resolution: Passed according to the original proposal. 6. How to decide the main points of the talk with the Director in the afternoon? Resolution: Please ask the Department to pay attention to the efficiency of personnel and seek the convenience of implementation separately.</p>
<p>Director Zhou's Speech: Director Zhou Fohai of the Jiangsu Department of Education talked about the convenience of inviting the principals of provincial middle schools to Zhenjiang for a meeting, inviting them to gather at the Department for communication, and at the same time listening to the actual management status of each school, or putting forward difficulties in school affairs for reference in improving secondary education in Jiangsu Province. After the reorganization of each school in Jiangsu Province, the principals and members of the Education Federation have been able to work hard on school affairs, so the academic style is simple and honest and full of vitality, and it can be gradually improved in the future. The education situation in each county is complicated and reorganization is not easy. The reasons are that the county magistrate does not pay attention to education, the selection of the director of the county education bureau is difficult, and the local concepts of the people in each county are too heavy, hindering the reorganization of county education, etc. At present, the Department is working hard to advocate the centralization and reorganization of school property in each county, so that the education funds of the county will gradually be enriched. The Department cherishes those who have outstanding abilities as directors of the education bureau and helps them to eliminate all obstacles so that they can stay in their positions for a long time. The infighting in education in each county of Jiangsu Province is the most serious. Now, except for Changshu, which is still in dispute, the rest of the counties can gradually get on the right track.</p>

<h3>Chinese Agricultural Society Plans to Build the Shu Ji Memorial Library</h3>
<p>Suggests the Central Government to Establish a Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</p>

<h3>Salary Demand Trend of Teachers and Staff in Jinling Primary and Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>Principal Wang Huanzhang Embezzles Public Funds and Deducts Salaries</p>
<p>Mediation by the Education Bureau Does Not Work</p>
<p>All Teachers and Staff Call on Various Groups for Assistance</p>
<p>The Jinling Primary and Secondary School on Hongkou Wuzhou Road in this city has a long history and the school's affairs are fairly developed. Unfortunately, this semester, due to the principal's deduction of salaries and the teachers' inability to obtain salaries, a trend has occurred. After mediation by the Education Bureau, a satisfactory result has not been obtained. The principal and teachers are likely to meet in court. The Shanghai News reporter believes that this matter is of great concern to people in the teaching field, and specially records the course of events as follows:</p>
<p>The school was originally named Gongdu Public School. The school has a long history. It was founded 36 years ago and was originally named Christian Public School. It was founded by the American Christian Association in the 24th year of the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. In the 8th year of the Republic of China, Wang Huanzhang and others took over and renamed it Jinling No. 1 Public School. Later, it was renamed the Primary and Secondary School of the Jinling University Alumni Association. It is a school with a long history in Hongkou. The school's affairs are fairly developed. The chairman of the school board is Wu Dongchu, the vice chairman is Wei Wenhan, and the school board members are Tan Rongpu, Liu Jingwan, Liu Xuyuan, Hong Huanxiang, Wang Bingrong, Cui Shuzhu, Zhou Maofan, Wang Hongmo, Ren Yangui, and Hu Xiangquan. The principal is Wang Huanzhang, and the dean of teaching is Yang Geng.</p>
<p>Deduction of Salaries Triggers Trends: All of the school's soldiers Mao Rongzong, Shi Yunshi, Shi Hongru, Zheng Weirui, Chen Hongnian, Wang Bingrong, Chen Xingcheng, Guan Maojiang, Xu Zhusan, He Shaozhai, Wen Tianping, Gu Yuren, Li Huaibai, Zhu Damin and other more than 30 people, because the school principal Wang Huanzhang embezzled public funds and deducted salaries, repeatedly demanded payment, but did not pay them, so they jointly filed a complaint with the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Party Department and other agencies, requesting assistance. The school authorities heard the news and on October 24 at 2 pm, Principal Wang, accompanied by Wei Wenhan, a representative of the school board, came to the school and claimed to the teachers and staff that salaries would be paid on November 1. The school was slightly relieved. On October 31, the principal suddenly forced each teacher and staff member to sign an illegal document before paying salaries. At that time, the teachers and staff refused to sign. The draft of the document is as follows: Dear Sir, the salary owed by Mr. Wang Huanzhang to me is ○○ yuan. I should seek compensation from Mr. Wang Huanzhang personally, and I will never ask the school board or the school to repay it. If the school's income and expenses are offset and there is a surplus, and the school board believes that my payment can be gradually compensated, regardless of whether it is a partial payment, the amount, or how it is allocated, all shall be decided by the school board, and I will not hold any objection. Furthermore, I will not transfer the rights of my payment to a third party. This letter is sent to the Jinling Primary and Secondary School Board for your reference.</p>
<p>The Education Authorities Have Mediated: After receiving the complaint, the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Education Bureau sent personnel to investigate. The Education Bureau also sent Sun Shiju to convene representatives of the school board, the principal, and the teachers and staff to the Bureau on the 8th of last month to settle the matter. The school board did not attend that day, and Principal Wang Huanzhang fully represented the board. At that time, it was publicly decided that all outstanding salaries below 100 yuan would be paid in full, those between 100 yuan and 200 yuan would be paid 80%, and those above 200 yuan would be paid half, and the remaining arrears would be raised gradually, with the end of December this year as the deadline for full payment. Both parties accepted and had no objection. However, Principal Wang repeatedly delayed and did not comply. The teachers and staff petitioned the Education Bureau again, and the school only paid half a month's salary on the 10th of last month.</p>
<p>Calling on All Circles for Assistance Again: The school's teachers and staff felt that the school was insincere in paying the arrears and submitted a petition to the Party and government agencies and various education groups, stating that they were repeatedly requesting salaries but could not obtain them, and they were exhausted and their lives were at stake. They earnestly requested assistance to relieve the plight and save lives. The school teachers and staff are submitting the petition because the Jinling University Alumni Association Primary and Secondary School has been in arrears of salaries for several months (a total of 1,770 yuan and 43 cents as of October). They previously petitioned your association for relief and hoped that you would forward it to the Education Bureau to order the payment of salaries to maintain their lives. At the same time, the teachers and staff personally went to the Education Bureau to plead for assistance. They were all mediated by Mr. Sun Shiju of the Bureau. The teachers and staff respected the orders of their superiors and obeyed the guidance of the competent personnel. They still returned to the school with empty stomachs to perform their duties, consolidating the prestige of the Education Bureau, and they did not dare to be ignorant and engage in wasting the students' time. However, the school board and the principal did not take education seriously, relied on their power to bully others, and despised the Education Bureau. They spoke earnestly, but they ignored it. They even placed the lives of hard-working teachers at the mercy of the capitalists. Now, in the cold winter, the north wind is whistling, and they have no clothes and no food. Their lives are at stake. Not only can they not bear the responsibility of teaching, but they also cannot take care of the burden of their families. For this reason, they have no choice but to beg your association to investigate, take pity on their plight, and earnestly provide assistance and ask the Education Bureau to quickly order the school board and the principal to pay the salaries immediately to relieve the plight and save lives. They cannot express their gratitude enough. Sincerely,</p>

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education and the Educational Association Jointly Conduct General Disaster Relief Donations</h3>
<p>This year, the disaster situation in various regions is extremely severe. Mayor Wu convened representatives from various institutions and organizations in this city to discuss ways to conduct a general donation drive for disaster areas. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Educational Association were elected to form a general donation committee. In the past, people in the education field have made great efforts to raise funds for disaster victims. After the establishment of the general donation committee, the Municipal Bureau of Education specially convened principals of various schools for talks and collaborated with the Municipal Educational Association to carry out the work. It is reported that after the Bureau of Education and the Educational Association initiated this general donation drive for disaster relief, faculty, staff, and students of various schools have been working hard to carry it out, and it is expected that good results will be achieved.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Popular Education Assistance Association</h3>
<p>On the third of this month, the initiators of the Popular Education Assistance Association held a meeting. Zhang Shaolin, a retired staff member, without the approval of the preparatory committee, arbitrarily recruited eight work-study students, advertising that no fees would be charged. However, afterward, he forced each student to pay uniform fees ranging from thirty to forty yuan, and apprenticeship ceremony fees ranging from six to eight yuan. Badges worth only two cents were sold for one yuan without authorization, and the excess was pocketed privately. After student worker Tang Changsheng reported this, an investigation confirmed the facts. Initiators such as Shen Jiucheng, He Bingsong, Tao Xingzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Li Dachao, Wang Xiaoying, Lin Pengxia, and Huang Jingwan hired lawyer Sun Zuji to handle the litigation related to the association's preparations. All matters must be approved by the preparatory meeting and implemented by Tao Xingzhi. The situation in the association is now very good. After the registration procedures are completed, a general meeting will be convened to formally establish the association.</p>

<h3>Shen Pengfei Discusses the Recent Situation at Jinan University</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited Jinan University President Pengfei at the university in Zhenru. According to him, the recent situation at Jinan University is quite optimistic. Students in all departments have been focusing on their studies this semester. Professors have rarely been absent, and even when they are, they make up for the missed classes. This shows the enthusiasm of the professors. Mr. Li Ximou, Dean of the College of Science and concurrently Dean of Academic Affairs, pays close attention to student learning. The usual monthly exams are very strict. Mr. Meng Shouchun, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, and Mr. Xun Xiujia, Dean of the College of Business, are both very responsible for the academic affairs of their respective colleges and come to the university to work every day. In terms of the library, the librarian, Mr. Cha Xiu, has been instructed to add a large number of new books to meet the needs of students. As for the university's construction, there is still a lack of sports facilities. I have already written to architects to draw up plans and am trying to raise funds to start construction as soon as possible. Mr. Shen also stated that his approach to running the university is always pragmatic. In the next semester, he plans to hire renowned scholars to teach at the university.</p>

<h3>Two Railways Hold Qingyang Port Scout Rowing Competition</h3>

After discussion, because there are eight teams joining the competition, the original departure time was scheduled for 9:00 am, but it was feared that grouping them would take too long, so it was decided to change the meeting time to 8:00 am at the station, and the Railway Administration will fully prepare rescue personnel to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Fawning and Flattery Meet the Lamp Illuminating, the Withered and Hungry Stomach Drives Makeup to Learn Elegance</p>
<p>Auntie Hu raised her chopsticks, not asking good or bad, and immediately ate several pieces of stir-fried leeks with shredded pork, which were truly fresh and salty. After eating a few bites, she couldn't put down her chopsticks. After biting two pieces of cornbread, she picked up a few strands of leeks and put them in her mouth to chew. Turning her head to see Yueying sitting listlessly on the side, staring blankly, she broke off a large piece of cornbread, stuffed it into her hand, and said with a smile, "Why are you just staring? He's inviting us to eat, so let's just eat. Even if we don't eat, we still have to appreciate his kindness." Yueying originally didn't want to eat, but she hadn't had enough to eat for two days. Now that she had something to fill her stomach in her hand, deliberately not eating would be too unfair to her own belly. Moreover, Auntie Hu was holding cornbread in her left hand and stir-fried leeks with shredded pork in her right, chewing with a clicking sound, and the flames of that appetite were almost spraying out from her seven orifices. She couldn't bear it, so she brought the cornbread to her mouth and first bit off a little corner to try. Although the thing was very rough, it was softened and made fragrant and delicious by the saliva in her mouth. Unconsciously, she sent the cornbread into her stomach. Seeing that she didn't have any cornbread in her hand, Auntie Hu broke off another piece and stuffed it into her hand, saying with a smile, "Since you've eaten, just keep eating." If Yueying hadn't touched the cornbread at all, she wouldn't have felt anything, but after her mouth was stained with food, she wanted to eat even more. So this time, when Auntie Hu stuffed the cornbread into her hand, she couldn't hesitate like before. She took it in her hand and stuffed it into her mouth. Before long, she finished what was in her hand. Following this trend, naturally, she wouldn't stop. In the end, she swept away everything that Little Ji had brought out. It was just that the canned pickled mustard tuber was too salty to finish, so Auntie Hu poured it out and wrapped it all up with the old paper on the table. Looking outside the door to see that no one was there, she put it in her pocket. (83)</p>

<h3>Remembering Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Bomin</p>
<p>Although I am very tired of city life, how can I return to the countryside? Thinking that life will ultimately not escape the circle of the city, I cannot help but forever remember the gentle and peaceful Hangzhou. Last night, my fellow villager Shen Banmei invited me to Zhiweiguan to taste the flavors of Hangzhou cuisine. Coincidentally, my younger brother came from Hangzhou, and at the dinner table, I also met Mr. Chen Junyi and Huang Xuchu, who had just played in Hangzhou. At that time, eating vinegar fish, water shield, and several other Hangzhou dishes, listening to the full-mouthed Hangzhou accent of the waiter, and talking about the various events in Hangzhou, I almost thought we were in between the Six Bridges and the Three Temples. Returning to my residence, I couldn't help but remember Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Speaking of Hangzhou, this place is truly worthy of people's joy and admiration. Just think, isn't there this sentence in ancient poems?</p>
<p>This is: "Directly take Hangzhou as Bianzhou."</p>
<p>This Bianzhou is the ancient Bianliang, which was once the capital of the country. That is enough to make people think that Hangzhou in the past was as magnificent as the hometown of emperors. Moreover, Hangzhou was also once the capital during the Southern Song Dynasty. And there is also a popular folk proverb: "Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." Isn't this an ironclad annotation that Hangzhou is worthy of joy and admiration?</p>
<p>Hangzhou is truly like heaven; the most beautiful place in this place is the West Lake, and the mountains surrounding the lake are also very beautiful. In the mountains and on the lake, there are temples and monasteries everywhere, symbolizing the appearance of heaven. There are also small boats in the "Red Cliff Night Cruise" picture, and there are painted boats, truly occupying all the beautiful scenery of the world. I think if you are a famous writer, then the place to write manuscripts must be Hangzhou.</p>
<p>I used to live in Hangzhou. I remember that every time the weather was cool but not cold in the evening, I would always go to the Hubin Park area with Lifang without spending a penny, to relax. Sometimes, leaning on the railing and jumping into the distance, taking advantage of the setting sun, I would point out the peaks and laugh and talk about my ambition to buy a mountain and live in seclusion with her in the future. This dream is truly forever remembered in my heart.</p>
<p>I remember Hangzhou! Although when it comes to the typical city, Hangzhou is far inferior to Shanghai, and there is no atmosphere of foreign masters there. But fortunately, Hangzhou does not have these, which is why it is worthy of remembering.</p>
<h3>The Temple of Literature in Early Winter</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Autumn has already said goodbye to the world. When you step on the street and a gust of cold wind blows in your face, you will feel some cold air on your body. At the same time, the old trees on the side of the street have also been blown off a few yellow leaves, rolling on the ground with the wind. This is obviously the weather of early winter, right?</p>
<p>In Nanshi, if you have nothing to do, the only place to pass the time is probably only the Temple of Literature, right? In this early winter weather, when you step into the Temple of Literature, isn't everything still the same as usual? But the flowers in the Temple of Literature Park have withered, the grass has withered and yellowed, and except for some evergreen trees, the leaves of the trees have also fallen off and are almost bald. There is nothing as lively as autumn, right?</p>
<p>Among the friends who are touring the park here, no one came by car, everyone walked here, right? At most, only a few came by rickshaw. Therefore, when you walk to the park gate, you will experience that there is a kind of democratic meaning here. This park is not the exclusive property of a few idle classes!</p>
<p>On the grass that is about to wither, the slogans of the New Life Movement, "Understand Propriety and Righteousness" and "Know Shame," will immediately make you feel that you should be extra cautious here and not violate any prohibitions!</p>
<p>Look, on the sidewalk, people are walking in a continuous stream. The iron benches are full of men and women, and there is no empty seat left. In the Great Achievement Hall, scholars are admiring the relics of Confucius. The library is full of ambitious young people reading books and newspapers—this is a light description of a painting of the Temple of Literature in early winter.</p>

<h3>Female Pedicurists</h3>
<p>— Wang Shapa</p>
<p>It is said that female pedicurists are also one of the new female professions! Although this term is not very pleasant to hear and the job seems humble, it is not only easy to do but also quite profitable! Every day, they earn anywhere from four or five yuan to seven or eight yuan, which is comparable to the salary of a high-ranking employee. This is because their clients are all higher-class Western families. Chinese people would never patronize them. Their price per job is roughly one to two yuan. It is said that this skill, like hairdressing, requires hard work to learn, and also requires fluency in a foreign language.</p>
<p>In addition to pedicures, they also do manicures, but the money has to be given separately.</p>
<p>Here—on Shanzhong Road—female pedicurists can often be seen. The reason is that most of the residents in the tall Western-style houses are Japanese and Westerners, so female pedicurists are often seen.</p>
<p>When they go to offer their skills after being notified by the servant, long cheongsams and short coats are nothing special. Some even wear high heels and take chartered cars. They carry a handbag, and to those who don't know them, they must seem like female students or female doctors!</p>
<p>There is a female pedicurist named Chen who must be highly skilled and have a good business. She always earns more than ten yuan a day. She has a daughter who studies at a school on Haig Road and goes to school every day in a chartered car.</p>

<h3>From Writing to Plagiarism</h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>Why do we write articles? It's a long story, but to put it simply: people cannot be without emotions, and since there are feelings, there must be a way to express them. When speaking with the mouth, it is called "speaking," and when writing with a pen, it is called "articles." And speaking, except for the phonograph, which can be preserved for centuries, cannot be passed on to later generations. Moreover, the phonograph was not invented before 1877. Since it was invented, no one has had the convenience of singing their "sorrows and joys" into a recording machine. Therefore, writing articles has become a social undertaking, with a strong influence on public consciousness. Stalin of Soviet Russia therefore said that writers are "the soul engineers of the whole people." Some even say that the French Revolution originated from Rousseau's thesis, and the transformation of Soviet Russian politics benefited from the novels of Turgenev and others. It can be seen that writing articles really has a dual meaning of natural expression and adapting to objective environmental needs.</p>
<p>What does the substance of "moaning without illness" contain? Therefore, the eight-legged essays and examination poems of the Qing Dynasty are worthless in modern times, while the Li Sao, which writes about a lifetime of melancholy, is still praised even though the words are difficult to understand. This is not to say that the rhetoric of the Li Sao is necessarily better than the works of the Qing Dynasty's court literati, but the difference lies in the fact that Qu Yuan had to write to express his loneliness and anger. In the examination hall, the examinees had no desires or thoughts in their hearts and reluctantly wrote eight-legged essays, adding a "given title" at the end, praising the emperor. May I ask, what value does this article have?</p>
<p>From this, we can know that writing articles must not be "empty talk." Things that are empty talk are just wax apples and paper-cut flowers, which cannot be chewed or smelled because they have no real life.</p>
<p>However, in this day and age, there are countless writers who write about different life experiences in different stages of consciousness. And there are also some pitifully clever people who consider themselves to be "writers" and rely on "selling articles for a living." Selling articles for money, and money for food, is originally a "noble occupation" in the eyes of gentlemen, but unfortunately, creating a noble occupation is not as easy as picking up mustard seeds. It is necessary to read a few books, walk a few miles, use your brain, and pick up a pen. When "inspiration strikes," pick up a pen and write, pouring out thousands of miles, only then can you be considered a writer. If you don't even have these skills, frowning and crying, unable to write a single word all day long, and you have to eat and wear clothes, then—then "plagiarism" comes!</p>
<p>The wind of plagiarism has existed since ancient times. However, the ancients were much cleverer after all. For example, the opening sentence of Du Fu's "Spring View," "The country is broken, but the mountains and rivers remain; in the spring city, the grass and trees are deep," is similar to Jing Shu's poem on the Ci'en Temple Pagoda in the Tang Dynasty, "The mountains and rivers of the Han country remain; the grass and trees are deep in the Qin mausoleum. The evening clouds stretch for thousands of miles, and there is no place without heartbreak." Lu You's "I wish to transform my body into a thousand billion, one plum blossom, one Lu You," seems to have been stolen from Liu Zongyuan's poem "Seeing the Mountains with Haochu and Sending to Relatives and Friends in the Capital," which says: "The sharp mountain by the sea is like the tip of a sword, and the sadness cuts the intestines everywhere in autumn. If I could transform my body into a thousand billion, I would scatter them on the peaks and look towards my hometown." However, this kind of plagiarism is limited to the method of chapters and sentences and still has the author's spirit in it. Perhaps they loved a certain line of someone's poem, treasured it in their hearts for a long time, and when they sang it themselves, they unconsciously melted it into their works, which is not worthy of criticism. As for the notebooks of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, which plagiarized each other, there are countless examples, but everyone can always, in a large paragraph of text, either reverse the facts, or insert other themes, or plagiarize the meaning but not the words, using various methods to avoid being recognized as "plagiarism" at a glance.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that there are now many "writers" who unceremoniously copy the articles of their contemporaries in the same way, crown them with their own names, and send them to newspapers or magazines for publication. The inner meaning of this, if it is not to cheat for稿费 (payment), to support one's own life, it must be to deliberately make trouble for the editors, thinking that deceiving and selling is precisely mocking the editors' lack of knowledge. (In fact, there are so many Chinese publications, how can editors browse all of them and how can they never forget after reading them?) The former is hateful, but understandable, while the latter is a hooligan's trick, and the sin is unforgivable. However, the exposure of plagiarists and the cancellation of payments are seen on publications from time to time, and the same infamous events continue to occur!</p>
<p>To purify the literary world, it is undoubtedly necessary to eradicate these "plagiarists"—regardless of whether the reason for their plagiarism is for survival.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Surprisingly Loose, Market Sentiment Softens</p>
<p>Gold Price Decline Intensifies</p>
<p>Major Players Attempting to Cover Short Positions Proves Ineffective</p>
<p>Result: Another Drop of Five Yuan and Forty Cents</p>
<p>The gold market has been weak for several consecutive days, with an unusually poor performance. Although major players stepped in yesterday to cover short positions, the loose and excessive foreign exchange market and persistent selling pressure within the market caused a severe decline, impossible to recover from. Despite strong buying interest, it was difficult to sustain. Yesterday morning, overseas silver markets saw British silver rise while American silver remained flat. There was little fluctuation in the Montreal forward silver market, and exchange rates were stable. However, London spot gold continued to rise by four and a half pence, leading to off-exchange pre-market trading opening at 934 yuan. Unfortunately, market sentiment was bearish, and there was eager selling, causing the price to fall. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both British and American currencies remaining flat, and the customs gold unit rising by five percent. The standard price of gold was raised again to 1014.7 yuan and seven jiao. Although the opening price in the morning was low, major players aggressively bought on the dip, and the demand side remained strong, gradually pulling the price up after the opening. However, due to the hardening foreign exchange market, supply sources continued to emerge at higher prices, preventing a surge. It was anticipated that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would announce its official exchange rates, with the British pound rising by 1.25 and the American dollar by 0.25. Sellers took advantage and lowered their prices, but major players continued to push forward, leading to considerable struggle. As the banks repeatedly offered, and the foreign exchange market hardened, the 90-yuan mark was briefly broken, but it soon recovered. The silver equalization tax was announced, remaining at 6.75%, calculated with the British exchange rate at one shilling and five and seventy-five pence. Market sentiment was exceptionally uncertain. Major players continued to buy and cover short positions, and sellers briefly yielded. In addition, banks reversed their position on shillings, leading to a rebound. However, the increase was temporary, and the market soon stabilized. As the banks were concealing selling appetite, selling pressure resurfaced after entry, gradually moving downstream. Once the 90-yuan mark was broken again, market sentiment became increasingly unsustainable. Selling pressure surged for a time, and the market was gripped by panic. The spot foreign exchange market was loose and excessive, declining steadily, and becoming even weaker after the close. The after-hours market was flat, with major players taking advantage of the low prices and buying, leading to an increase from the lows. Although there were fluctuations, the situation was generally stable. However, due to the continued hardening of the domestic market, selling sentiment was easily stirred up, and the market fluctuated and fell after entry. However, there were quite a few who came forward to maintain the price at low levels, allowing it to rise. The initial report from India showed a decrease of 1.1 anna and no change, leading to increased buying interest and a rise in prices. However, as supply sources continued to emerge at higher prices, the market gradually declined. After this, there were few special changes, and market sentiment was flat. The second report from India showed no change, and the market finally stabilized. The market situation was severely weak throughout the day. Major short positions continued to be covered, and major players continued to buy, but only in small lots for the time being. The outcome was truly unexpected. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 991 yuan and two jiao, nine jiao lower than the previous close. Shunmao, Futai, Hengtongchun, Yumao, Yongzhengchang, Yuqingyong, and Jujin all advanced from nine jiao gradually to two yuan and eight jiao. The foreign exchange market remained firm, with a rather soft trend that was difficult to rise. Hengyu and Dingtai sold at higher prices. The anticipated HSBC official rates were released: the British pound rose by 1.25 and the American dollar by 0.25, leading to a decrease to eight jiao. Shunmao, Fuxing, and Yongjin reached one yuan and six jiao. However, Citibank sold U.S. dollars for January at 0.625, and McCallum sold shillings for January at 0.3125. Zhaofengchang, Fuxingyong, Hengyu and others bought in and then sold out. Hengxingyuanchangyong also sold, retreating to three jiao. Tianfengzhengchang bought aggressively on the dip, rising again to one yuan and a half. However, the foreign exchange market continued to harden, and Mitsui came out with U.S. dollars for January at 0.6875. Fuxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, and Lai sold, causing a fall to 89 yuan and a half. Fuxingyong, Shunmaozhaofengchang, and others jointly entered into contracts. Fuyu, Changda, and others sold, but the price rebounded to 92 yuan and nine jiao. Jiaotong bought shillings for February at 0.1875. Dalian sold up to one yuan and three jiao, but Shunmao continued to buy, raising the price again to two yuan and two jiao. HSBC released U.S. dollars for January at 0.6875. The domestic market remained firm, and Hengyu, Yifengyong, Hengxingzhaofengchang, Xiangfengdachangxiang, and others sold. Retail investors forcefully pushed the price down, breaking the 90-yuan mark again. Rumors that Holland had abandoned the gold standard, though lacking confirmation, caused a fall to 87 yuan and seven jiao. Yuli, Fuyu, Dayuan, Chunyuan, and Yong bought contracts, rising to eight yuan and six jiao. Yongfeng offered supply, and the afternoon close retreated again to 988 yuan and two jiao. After the close, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, and others aggressively sold, causing great fear in the market and a fall to within six yuan. Fuxingyong took advantage of the low price to enter, slightly pulling the price up.</p>
<p>The after-hours market opened at 985 yuan and seven jiao. Zhaofengchang and Hengyu entered into contracts, rising again to six yuan and eight jiao. Tianfengyong offered supply, causing a decrease to five yuan and nine jiao. Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Yuli, and Fuyu still accepted, rising to six yuan and nine jiao. The Central Bank sold U.S. dollars for April at 0.125, making it difficult to rise quickly. Yongde, Qianchangxiang, Yuanyi, and Hengyuchangda sold contracts. McCallum sold shillings for April at four pence, retreating to five yuan and three jiao. Yuanmao, Yonghengyu, and Dingkang accepted contracts, rising to six yuan and a half. Fuan and Dalian's retail investors continuously sold contracts, causing a fall to five yuan. Anda bought U.S. dollars for March at 0.375. Yuanyi, Dingkang, and Zhaofengchang took advantage of the low price to accept contracts, gradually pulling the price up. Fuxingyong, Zhaofengchang, and Dingkang continued to buy. The initial report from Bombay showed a decrease of 1.1 anna and no change, gradually rising to seven yuan and a half. McCallum bought U.S. dollars for March at 0.4375. At this time, the market was quite stable. Soon after, because Tianfeng, Hengyu, and Dalian and others sold at high prices, the price gradually decreased to five yuan and a half. Richang, Fuan, Yicheng and others still had buying interest, gradually rising to seven yuan and one jiao. The Dalian group supplied contracts at high prices. After this, the second report from India showed no change, and the overall trend was stable. Under the fluctuations, the closing price was 986 yuan and seven jiao. After the close, the market was slightly stable. Checking the day's highest price, 992 yuan and nine jiao, and the lowest price, 985 yuan, there was a fluctuation of seven yuan. As a result, the closing price fell five yuan and forty cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was raised to 1014 yuan and seven jiao due to the Central Bank's standard gold price announcement. Based on the closing price, it was about 28 yuan higher, 8 yuan more than the previous close. The book price for this month was 979 yuan, and for January it was 988 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 979 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary water was 978 yuan. The price of refined gold was still 2 yuan cheaper than the gold standard price, with a listed price of 989 yuan and two jiao. The spot market was stable, with Tianjin goods priced at an additional 3 yuan. There was still a lack of significant transactions in the market, making it rather quiet. The forward market was also quiet, as the trend for December contracts had been determined. After the short side, Dafengheng, released 35 public contracts, the December contracts were completely settled.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was flat. In summary, Yuqingyong, Tongtaichang, Tianfengshunmao, Shunlifuxingyong, Yichengjintong, Hengtaiqingyu, Yuhehuixiang, Honglihongxing, Shenkangyong'an, Dafayongrichang, and Dingkang were on the buying side. Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, Hengxingyuanyifa, Yongchangsheng, Yongyuanyitong, Fenghanghenghangchang, Yonghouchangyong, Wanfenyongfenghengxing, Yifengyonghengyu, and Wanxing were on the selling side. Futaiheng and Tongchun Changda Fuan bought and sold, Fuxingyong and Tianfeng sold and bought. Yuqingyong, in addition to covering short positions, also transferred more than 1,000 contracts with Tongfenghang. Dalian shorted over 1,000 contracts, traded over 1,200 contracts in total and covered over 300 contracts. Wanxing traded over 1,100 contracts in total and sold 500 contracts. The Guangdong group Shengda slightly sold. Hengxing bought a few and sold over 200 contracts. The total trading volume for the day was 37,807 contracts in the morning session, 22,470 contracts in the afternoon session, and 27,223 contracts in January futures. There were a total of 66 bulls and 49 bears.</p>
<p>Public contracts were completely cleared for December after the day's settlement. Yesterday, the short side, Dafengheng, released 35 contracts. Today, the long side received 21 contracts from Yongli, and 7 contracts each from Yifengyong and Daxingyong. The settlement price was 979 yuan.</p>
<p>Banks Continue to Release Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Spot Market Becomes Increasingly Loose</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the large London cables rose 0.0625 for both near and far terms. American silver remained unchanged. The Montreal forward silver price was also flat. London spot gold rose by four pence. British currency versus U.S. dollar, British currency versus French franc both remained unchanged. U.S. dollar versus British currency rose by 0.25, U.S. dollar versus French franc remained unchanged. The morning opening for the foreign exchange market showed near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4.5 pence for British currency, 3.375 for December, 34.0625 yuan for the American dollar, and 33.875 yuan for December. There were no differences from the previous close. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were released, with both British and American currencies remaining flat, and the Customs Gold Unit rising by five percent. The market opening was relatively stable. However, because the banks continued to offer, and the HSBC announced official exchange rates with British currency rising by 1.25 and the American dollar by 0.25, the process continued to harden. But the Chinese merchants' psychology remained stable. The silver equalization tax was announced with no change. The Chinese merchants' appetite was briefly invigorated. Jiaotong and Sumitomo slightly bought shillings on the cheap, and the situation tightened slightly. But it was ultimately unsustainable, and the banks continued to supply. Chinese merchants' psychology ultimately couldn't hold, and the market gradually hardened. The gap between the spot and futures markets widened. The afternoon market was flat. Sassoon bought shillings, while the Central Bank sold U.S. dollars. The banks continued to have selling appetite, and the process remained hard. But the forward market was stable, and the silver market continued to be willing to release. The initial report from India was down and then flat, but it had little impact on the foreign exchange market. The closing selling prices were 1 shilling 4.75 pence for British currency and 34.5 yuan for the American dollar.

<p>Securities: The Bond Market Remains Extremely Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange remained extremely quiet. The market situation remained sluggish, and foreign interbank call loan rates did not rise or fall. Market sentiment was unusually quiet. Brewing and hovering has been going on for many days. With the Fifth Plenary Session imminent, the goals expected by various groups are gradually approaching. The trend within the day should change slightly. After noon, a gradual selling trend began on the 21st, and ripples began to appear. Short positions were not small, watching to cover. Slight covering caused mutual movement. Long positions were not high or low, slightly out, then competing. The future may change from a small range of hovering to a larger range of hovering. The market price may rise from the bottom up. Yesterday's experience, the first two sessions in the morning, because the foreign interbank call loans were still unchanged, market sentiment was lax, and market prices varied, high and low. There were several types that were absolutely unchanged. The fluctuations in each session were only about five points or one jiao. The market was sluggish and boring. In the afternoon, due to the slight selling on the 21st, the market was stable with fatigue, but it only fluctuated by one or two jiao. In summary, the market price was still mixed, high and low. The number of declines was greater than the number of rises. The total number of transactions was only 5.23 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparative table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Leads Grain Market Higher</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market continued to rise yesterday (5th), with some special stocks soaring by more than nine yuan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average broke the 103 mark for the first time since April. The stock market's rise was driven by grains, especially the May wheat contract. Spot demand was very strong, domestic and foreign crop reports were poor, and foreign markets were strong. Furthermore, it was reported that local traders, seeing the summer drought, were deeply concerned about a shortage of grain and that southwestern farmers were being forced to gradually use wheat to feed livestock. Prices therefore soared. The bond market was strong, and technical company bonds were actively purchased. Small exchange stocks advanced under the leadership of coal oil, public utility, and alcohol stocks. Total trading volume for the day was 1.63 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Soars</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Bulls Actively Participate</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the rising trend has started again. Due to the consistent rise in overseas cotton markets, buyers are active, and market sentiment is high. Bulls in companies are greatly increasing their positions, so the market has become more tense. In the afternoon, it was reported that actual yarn sales were becoming sluggish. Because the end of the year is approaching soon, customers are preparing to close their accounts, so yarn sales have become relatively quiet.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rises by One Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning session. Because foreign cotton rose consistently, buyers were very active, and market sentiment was boiling. Bulls took the opportunity to buy, and the market became tighter and tighter. Each month rose by one yuan, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 jiao. The market atmosphere was high when it opened in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, when it reached the second or third session, the gold price fell, the cotton market retraced slightly, and actual yarn customers' business was dull. Only 500 bales were traded. Each month fell back by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao. The total volume traded for the day was 38,000 bales. Sales included 1,900 bales from Da Ji, 800 bales from Jin Chang, 500 bales from Ming De, 450 bales from Heng De, 1,150 bales from Shen Ji, 950 bales from Yi Da, 1,300 bales from Tai Chang, 1,400 bales from Yong Chang, 650 bales from Ren Feng, and 1,050 bales from Yi Cheng.

<p>Cotton Market Opens in Morning with Sharp Rise Due to the surge in Indian cotton Omula One by eight rupees and a half, and American cotton also rising by twenty points, the market heart was greatly shaken. As for the buyers, they get help from the rise of foreign cotton, the concept of looking up is more profound, so a certain company continues to take in a large amount. It was heard in the second half of the market that the gold market fell back and the market was tired.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Rises by About Five Jiao</p>
<p>Spot cotton opened in the morning session. Because Indian cotton continued to rise, short positions panicked, and the market atmosphere was particularly strong. American cotton also followed suit, rising by twenty points. The reason for the trend of Indian cotton was that the cotton growing area there was hit by heavy rains, and the source in the market was lacking. Japanese merchants bought in and rose sharply. Chang Feng and Da Fu bought in one or two "man" loads, making the trading floor tight. Each month rose by 0.6 to 0.75 jiao. The market situation changed when it reached the second or third session in the afternoon, with the gold price falling back slightly. According to a message from a certain cotton industry organization, Indian cotton may fall back by two or three rupees tomorrow, so the heart of the people was slightly relaxed. Each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 jiao. The total volume traded for the day was 143,000 loads. Sales included 5,000 loads from Changhe, 2,700 loads from Yuan Yi, 2,800 loads from Tong Xing, 4,900 loads from Yuan Da, 4,700 loads from Geng Feng, 12,700 loads from Yuan Da, 1,700 loads from Chang Ji, 1,600 loads from Shen Ji, 2,500 loads from Yong Chang, and 1,800 loads from Yi Cheng. Purchases included 10,300 loads from Da Fu, 1,600 loads from Chang Ji, 2,000 loads from Jun Chang, 15,100 loads from Chang Feng, 2,800 loads from Run Kang, 4,200 loads from Da Chang, 1,700 loads from Yuan Xing Chang, 2,100 loads from Yuan Da, 2,500 loads from Yi Chang, and 4,500 loads from Yi Kang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>December 37.35 37.00 37.10 Rise 0.55 148,100</p>

<p>Total 826,900</p>
<p>High Spot Cotton Prices Make Sales Even More Sluggish</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are flat, and factory demand is sluggish. But cotton futures are rising again. Those holding goods have very tight mouths, making it increasingly difficult to make deals. Sources included 650 bales of Yao cotton and 680 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<p>Indian and American Cotton Prices Rise Together</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm and strong due to good news from Liverpool and strong activity on Wall Street. Spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 17 to 22 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 9 points, and futures prices rose by 7 to 8 points. Indian cotton was strong due to a large number of short positions covering and Japanese merchants buying. Nagpur rose by 4.75 rupees, Omula rose by 8.5 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 4.25 rupees. The original telegram record on the left (5th telegram):</p>

<p>New York, 5th. The Paine Webber Company's estimate for the current cotton crop is 9,795,000 bales, with 8,934,000 bales already ginned.</p>
<p>Grain: Futures Wheat and Flour Both Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Flour Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning session, and all months showed a consistent upward trend. Based on foreign wheat quotes, Chicago rose by about 9 jiao to 1 yuan and 2 jiao, and Canada rose by about 7 to 8 jiao. When the opening prices were announced, the high rise in foreign wheat shocked the industry and outsiders alike. The opening price for the current month immediately rose by 2 points, reaching as high as 5 jiao and 2 points. Distant months also rose sharply by 2 to 3 points. By the second session, although the buying interest from outside the industry was still strong, factories had sold off, so market sentiment gradually became flat. Distant months were nearly a point lower than the initial opening. When the market opened in the afternoon, the opening price for the current month had returned to the 5-jiao mark. As for distant months, it was initially reported that a factory had continued</p>
<h3>Records of the Faint Scent of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Besides this large glass case, there was another very small glass case, inside which were two items unrelated to the portrait in the case; but they were equally precious. One was a jade ring, which the Empress Dowager said was often used by Emperor Qianlong during his lifetime, and the other was a very delicate and smooth snuff bottle, also carved from the most brightly colored jade. These were all items of relatively high value. Next in line were many musical instruments. Because Qianlong was a versatile monarch, proficient in Qin (zither), chess, calligraphy, and painting; his attainment in music was particularly high. These musical instruments had been personally played by him for a long time, so they were also considered a part of the very memorable relics.</p>
<p>Probably because this incomparably wise emperor was very fond of collecting porcelain during his lifetime, most of his relics were various kinds of porcelain, occupying almost eight-tenths of a large hall. Among these porcelains, many were cloisonné and bronze-colored. Those who knew the goods knew that they were rare精品s that were not easy to find. If they had been treasured all the way to the present, their value must have been very considerable!</p>
<p>That is all there is of Qianlong's relics! Although we all used a particularly respectful attitude and appreciated them for a long time, because Qianlong was indeed very far away from us, we could no longer, after viewing the relics, feel much sincere and earnest remembrance of him. Not only were we like this, but even the Empress Dowager herself probably did not have any deep feelings; although in fact she was the direct successor to Qianlong's authority, and she often liked to mention this talented ancestor, seemingly feeling very honored, but in her heart, he really had no place!

<h3>A Differing Opinion Presented to Mr. Wu Liping</h3>
<p>— Mengjia</p>
<p>In his article "Differences in Literature and Life," Mr. Liping presented two "different" opinions on Mr. Huanping's "Literature and Life," but his so-called "differences" were merely restating the latter's views. Let us look at Mr. Liping's "differing opinions": "First, I disagree with the idea that "a person as a poet" participating in real life can truthfully capture any image and express the truth and essence of life." The reason is that "a person "as a poet" is somewhat different from a person after all, and their attitude towards participating in real life is also different, so their life content is also different. At this time, if what the poet captures and expresses belongs to the scope of human beings, then its truthfulness is very questionable." Gorky and Balzac were not "people as poets" but participated in real life as "people," so "if you want to express the truth and essence of life, you must first live with the attitude of a person; only "direct" life can touch the truth and essence of life," otherwise, "even if the attitude towards real life is not a bystander's game, at least it is using real life as a means." (Note: This sentence seems to have a problem; it is probably referring to using visiting real life as a means) The examples are Tao Yuanming, who "returned to the field to become a farmer," and Chen Mengjia, who "participated in the Shanghai War to find poetry materials."</p>
<p>The point that Mr. Liping emphasizes above is the so-called "direct life," and this "direct life" is exactly the opposite of the so-called "observation-based life." We ask writers to immerse themselves in real life and capture their own images from this fertile field of reality. This statement is precisely aimed at the current general writers who limit their writing to "trivial matters around them." Emphasizing the importance of real-life experience in the production process of works does not mean obliterating the importance of the writer's talent, that is, the so-called "artistic expression." The problem must be clarified so that the discussion will not go astray. Mr. Liping has somewhat distorted the original author's opinion on this point. We say "direct real life" precisely because "observational real life" often makes people only see the surface of life and cannot delve into the core of life, so the result is often "untrue" in expression. But it is not to say that "indirect" or "observation-based methods" are completely undesirable. A writer's writing theme is complicated. If every aspect of life requires a "personal experience," then he must either be "immortal" or simply drop the pen, which can be said to be a joke.</p>
<p>When we say direct life, that is, asking writers to immerse themselves in objective real life, we are precisely asking writers to liberate themselves from the small room, or—if they are more wealthy, then it should be said that they are in a western-style building or villa—from their own narrow real life. Although "going to the crossroads" can also observe some truth about real life, which is certainly good; however, we also have the right to ask him to do better: to go to the countryside and factories. This also means that "it is always better for artists to delve into the actual life of the people than to mix in the so-called literary world and do nothing (should add a sentence: and do some "leisurely" things)." That makes it impossible for him to produce any great works at present, but this possibility is always greater than continuing to be careless, because in this real-life process, his image storage will be enriched along with his life experience. At the same time, real life is diverse and complex; therefore, in art, we need not only tragic marches but also the era's eulogies that can profoundly embody the torment and sorrow of the soul of the dwarfs in the era's boiler.</p>
<p>Oh dear, I've gone too far.</p>
<p>Mr. Liping's first mistake is that he regards the writer's participation in real life and the indirect observation of life as the same thing. At the same time, because of his mechanical view of "people as poets" and "people in general"—only seeing the differences between the two and obliterating the sameness between the two—he derives the erroneous conclusion that "people as poets participating in real life cannot truthfully capture typical images," and even thinks that "literary figures are never created; they are just people of real life, and their works are just direct life experiences. They do not live in order to produce great works. If there are great literary works in China, they must not be works of the "people as poets and novelists" type." And his most brilliant, and also most erroneous, conclusion: "Literary figures are not created, which is equivalent to not being able to create literary figures." It is also based on his erroneous point of view. He flatly denies the future of general writers at the current stage. Literary figures are not created but are treasures that fall from the sky. Then, the requirement to enrich the writer's real life should be a useless act, and the work of attracting and guiding general writers at present is also superfluous. According to this, then we should no longer have any hope for general writers who do not have a fulfilling life, and if these people do not automatically change their careers, then they must be cursed to the end!</p>
<h3>Kukul River</h3>
<p>— Shidai</p>
<p>Stars are gone, the moon has fallen, why can't I see my beloved brother? Ma ta yi ma o, die ma yi ya yo, my eyes are swollen from crying, I don't sleep, eat, or drink.</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale girl, sitting on the green grass, holding a white, chubby little lamb. Frowning and looking up at the sky, she rubbed the lamb's back weakly and sang again and again in a sharp, thin voice.</p>
<p>The sound of the Kukul River flowing from afar, Ai Li Gale sang for a while and then closed her mouth, listening quietly to the murmuring water, penetrating her heart, penetrating the depths of her heart.</p>
<p>The sun moved onto the grass, onto the green Shabuer Plain. Horses neighed. Sheep jumped. The joyful cattle, like birds in a cage, staggered east and west. Camels lay motionless, sunbathing.</p>
<p>Worry deeply branded Ai Li Gale's brow.</p>
<p>——Zha Ke Balu brother!</p>
<p>Zha Ke Balu's shadow flickered before her eyes again, what a strong young man, copper shoulders and iron arms, who wouldn't like him! A purplish face hiding a smile, a pair of lively eyes, spraying charming light. When he came back from hunting in Mount Jibatu with a gun on his back, he walked past Ai Li Gale's yurt with a hey hey mouth, and Ai Li Gale peeked out, watching until Zha Ke Balu walked into the yurt before she dragged her heavy feet back to the yurt in a dispirited manner.</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale was silent, and after a while, she picked up her head and looked at the livestock lying, calling, and jumping on the grass.</p>
<p>Anxiety burned in her heart, she angrily pushed away the lamb in her arms, frantically tore at her hair, stood up and walked for a while, and then sat down and dug at the grass roots with her hands.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, Zha Ke Balu stood in front of her, with a gun on his back and a fox in his left hand. His eyes shot at Ai Li Gale's face, and Ai Li Gale felt hot all over, unable to speak.</p>
<p>Zha Ke Balu bent down to rub the sleeping little sheep:</p>
<p>—Miss Ai Li Gale, please give me this sheep!</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, he laughed loudly, and Ai Li Gale also knew clearly that he was joking, but she didn't say anything.</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale picked up a mud lump and threw it at the sheep on the opposite side, deliberately throwing it diagonally at Zha Ke Balu. Zha Ke Balu walked over with a smile and grabbed Ai Li Gale's hand.</p>
<p>—What a fierce young lady!</p>
<p>Her face turned hot, and she lowered her head.</p>
<p>After a long time, Ai Li Gale said softly:</p>
<p>—Are you willing to be with me?</p>
<p>Zha Ke Balu nodded with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>—I'll take you to see the water of the Kukul River!</p>
<p>There were no clouds in the sky, the sun became more and more coquettish, and the wind seemed to have been defeated and could not blow at all. Zha Ke Balu dragged Ai Li Gale, and Ai Li Gale called out to the flock of sheep.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, walking happily.</p>
<p>The water of the Kukul River was as clear as a mirror, and the green grass covered the river embankment, and the sunlight splashed on the water, emitting a glittering light. The two banks were a vast plain like a flat green felt.</p>
<p>Zha Ke Balu held Ai Li Gale's hand and paced along the river bank, and the light of the river reflected on their faces, making their purplish complexions extraordinarily charming.</p>
<p>The white flock of sheep was jumping, constantly moving on the green grass. The sunlight dyed the grass, dyed the flock of sheep, dyed the Kukul River, and dyed Zha Ke Balu's eyes.</p>
<p>The warm climate only attracted sleepy bugs, drilling into people's bodies and into livestock. A burst of laziness came up, which would make you listless, groggy, and your eyes dry and astringent. You would only feel comfortable after taking a nap.</p>
<p>The two people sat on the ground, not speaking to each other, you looked at me, I looked at you.</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale's heart suddenly jumped.</p>
<p>She discovered a secret in the flock of sheep.</p>
<p>A ram and a ewe were sleeping side by side! How comfortable!</p>
<p>Lowering her head with shyness, her face turned green with fire, her heart was thumping and thumping, and her whole body seemed to be boiling water.</p>
<p>After a while, she tried hard to suppress this heat, but she could not calm her beating heart.</p>
<p>——There was a day when I was with Zha...</p>
<p>Zha Ke Balu watched the changes in their expressions. She patted her heart, and her face showed a longing expression.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>At some point, a team of people and horses came from behind Mount Jibatu and walked along this side of the Kukul River. Zha Ke Balu stared at the group of people and horses. Within a hundred steps, he already understood that they were the soldiers under Che Khan, who were in charge of the herdsmen on the Shabuer Plain. When this team of people and horses stopped in front of them, Zha Ke Balu recognized that it was Sa Qi Gan, the head of the soldiers under Che Khan, leading fifty or sixty people and horses. Displaying their power and flaunting their might, they all dismounted, and a fierce look hung on the face of each soldier.</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale's heart was pounding in her mouth, she hugged Zha Ke Balu's waist with both hands, closed her eyes, and almost didn't dare to breathe.</p>
<p>Zha Ke Balu held up the fox with both hands:</p>
<p>—A gift for King Sa Qi Gan!—</p>
<p>Sa Qi Gan didn't say anything, nor did he take the fox. He stepped forward and dragged Ai Li Gale, asking with a smirk:</p>
<p>—Did he come to steal your sheep?</p>
<p>—No! He is a good person.</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale was shivering all over, and her jaw felt a little stiff.</p>
<p>A man in a yellow jacket walked to Sa Qi Gan's side and whispered something in Sa Qi Gan's ear.</p>
<p>Sa Qi Gan smiled hey hey, with a knife hidden in his smile.</p>
<p>With a snap, Sa Qi Gan's whip landed on Zha Ke Balu's body.</p>
<p>—Robber!</p>
<p>Ai Li Gale's heart felt like it was being stabbed with a knife!</p>
<p>—Girl, come with me.</p>
<p>Sa Qi Gan patted Ai Li Gale's shoulder. He was fascinated by this girl.</p>
<p>The whiplashes rang one after another on Zha Ke Balu's body, no one could bear it. Zha Ke Balu couldn't bear it any longer and lifted up his gun.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Sa Qi Gan fell to the ground in response, followed by:</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang……… The gunshots rang continuously, and in a burst of chaos, the horses jumped, the sheep scattered, and Ai Li Gale and Zha Ke Balu lost their lives in the gunshots!</p>
<p>The green plain, the flat grass, was painted with bright red blood, the sun was spraying heat, and the fishy stench swelled up.</p>
<p>A large group of soldiers carried Sa Zhengshi's body onto the horse, drove the sheep, and drove the camels, with sorrow smeared on everyone's face.</p>
<p>The water of the Kukul River flowed gurglingly, passing through the plain, a green grassland, inlaid with a winding white band.</p>
<p>A burst of crying came from afar, not knowing whose livestock the group of soldiers was shooting.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Yangon</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>I live upstairs in a small teahouse on Maung Khine Street. There is nothing to do, and few people come to chat. Most of my lonely time is spent idly gazing out the window and reading a worn-out book.</p>
<p>I have completely forgotten what the book said, but the various pictures of life seen from the window still remain clearly with distinct outlines and colors.</p>
<p>Every morning, along with the tender yellow sunlight, a Burmese monk slowly walking down the street appears before my eyes. He is bald, barefoot, wearing yellow robes, and holding a black lacquer bowl. When he arrives on the street in front of the teahouse, he walks up to the steps in front of a Chinese family's door diagonally across from me.</p>
<p>This is a rather wealthy Chinese family, which can be seen from the exquisite furniture in the room upon entering. The Burmese monk does not stand on the steps to beg for alms, but walks in as if he were coming home, sits down in a chair, motionless and silent, like a Buddha statue that has not sat cross-legged. A woman in a colorful dress immediately walks out of the room, looking neither Chinese nor Burmese (this is a woman born to a Chinese father and a Burmese mother). She takes off the slippers on her feet to the monk, kneels down, and kowtows respectfully before taking the monk's bowl. Then, she puts on her slippers and walks inside. After a while, when she brings out the bowl filled with rice and vegetables, she takes off her slippers again and kneels down to kowtow. The monk, on the other hand, sits there ignoring her, takes the bowl, and leaves silently.</p>
<p>During the day, I occasionally see compatriots in disheveled clothes, with short hair and unclean heads, standing on the steps in front of the door of the family that the monk visited, murmuring words that probably ask for help to return home. A man with a cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth and wearing a Chinese-style short outfit appears in the door, raises his fat hand, and waves unhappily, then disappears inside. Next, a thin Indian servant comes out, making a fuss with scolding and roaring gestures. Thereupon, the beggar who is adrift in a foreign country walks down the steps dejectedly, and turns back to scold the Indian man angrily:</p>
<p>"You black devil!"</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, the thin Indian servant hangs a large Chinese flag on the door of this family, fluttering under the eaves. Firecrackers that look like flashes of electricity are also set off in large numbers. When I get up the next morning and look, the street is covered with red paper flowers that are more than an inch thick. Before, I suspected from the impression that they had probably naturalized as Burmese, but at this time, I realized that they were indeed Chinese.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow (10)</h3>
<p>— (Written by Joseph Conrad) Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd came a step nearer, leaning forward, resting on his spade handle. "Go your way," he said angrily, and yet timorously too, for he was ever frightful of being made a fool of. Every state of mind, even madness, has its equilibrium based upon self-esteem. Disturb that, and you disturb misery; and Captain Hagberd lived amongst a system of unfathomable ideas, which made him feel that somebody was trying to jeer out his pain. Yes, other people's jeers were terrible. They suggested something wrong; but what? He couldn't tell: the stranger was clearly jeering—was at it on purpose in coming there. And the worse was doing it in the street, though he had never been so worked upon before.</p>
<p>The stranger, unaware of the nearness, of the elderly man's bent figure resting forward on his spade, said sternly, "I am not encroaching on any one, am I? I suspect your advertisement is somehow not quite right. Suppose you let me come inside."</p>
<p>"You come inside!" old Hagberd whispered, in extreme consternation.</p>
<p>"I could give you some really truthful news of your son—and the very last, if you care to listen."</p>
<p>"No," cried Hagberd loudly. He began pacing to and fro, shouldering his spade, waving the other hand aimlessly. "Here's a fellow—a jeering fellow, who says something is not quite right. I have news got more than you know. I've got all the news I want. I had it years ago—years ago—years ago—quite enough to wait for tomorrow. Let you come inside, indeed! What would Harry say?"</p>
<p>Bessie Carvil's form made a black patch upon the parlour window; then the door clicked, appearing before the other cottage, and every part of her was black, only above her head was something white. The men's voices beginning all at once speaking outside the door, (she had heard them before inside the house) gave her such an emotion, she could scarcely produce any sound.</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd looked as if he was trying to find a way out of a cage. His feet sank in the quagmire he had upturned. The holes in the debased lawn almost made him stumble. He blindly rushed to the paling.</p>
<p>"Here's comfort!" said the man at the door, sternly, stretching forth his arm, seizing his sleeve. "Somebody has been at you. Hullo! what clothes are these you wear? Good God, it's stiff canvas." He laughed. "Well, you are a figure!"</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd disengaged himself and began retreating abjectly. "Leastways now," he said in a tone of dispirited conviction.</p>
<p>"Something has come over him!" The stranger appealed to Bessie with an earnest request for explanation, as if they had been extremely intimate. "I didn't want to upset the old man." He lowered his voice as if he had known her for years. "I happened to step into a barber's round the corner—two pence for a shave—and they told me he was a bit of a figure. The old boy has made a perfect figure of himself."</p>

<p>Casual Remarks</p>
<h3>Photo of Pu Yi</h3>
<p>— Cow</p>
<p>Speaking of photographs, they are my favorite gift from heaven. For example, photos of prostitutes, photos of dancers, photos of movie stars, and even photos of naked women. If they are taken well and the faces are pretty, I will buy them and nail them to the wall, looking at them day and night, which I find very interesting.</p>
<p>Because photographs are realistic. If I haven't seen a woman before, seeing her photo is like seeing the woman herself. So, hanging a woman's photo on the wall feels like living with that woman. This is not me "daydreaming." I think there must be many "daydreamers" like me in the world.</p>
<p>Not only are photos of women lovely, but also photos of landscapes, or photos of ancient people and objects, are lovely. There are many famous mountains and scenic spots in the world, and we often can't go to enjoy them. But seeing photos is like having been there. Also, rare treasures and famous historical figures, which cannot be collected or seen in reality, can be seen through photos, as if they have been collected or met in person.</p>
<p>In addition, I also thoroughly like photos of important people. Because I cannot climb up to important people or get close to them, hanging their photos on the wall is like having a "heart-to-heart talk in a small room" or "sharing a conversation at the table" with them. Involuntarily, I feel larger, more generous, and more ambitious.</p>
<p>There is another type of photo that I also like, which is the record of the Northeast Volunteer Army's resistance against Japan. Since "September 18th," the four provinces have fallen. The patriotic men and women of the Northeast do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives, fighting the Japanese and traitors hand-to-hand in the white mountains and black waters. I truly admire this patriotic spirit "with my whole body prostrate on the ground." Seeing these photos makes my blood boil. So, these photos are also lovely.</p>
<p>The most unsightly photos are those of Zhong Kui catching ghosts, or of robbers being sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. They are disgusting to look at. Because these photos cause both fear and hatred. If I see such photos, I will tear them up and burn them, destroying the evidence, and never let them leave any impression.</p>
<p>What is Pu Yi? He is a puppet of the Japanese, used by the Japanese as a tool to deceive the world. But he can't deceive the 30 million people of the Northeast Provinces, nor can he deceive the eyes and ears of people all over the world. Now, the pseudo-Ministry of Education wants to implement slave education. In order to numb the people of the Northeast Provinces, they recently ordered the pseudo-Ministry of Education to distribute photos of Pu Yi, the puppet who performed the ugly drama when he usurped the throne, to all primary and secondary schools in Manchuria, to be hung in the auditoriums and classrooms. "Who am I deceiving? Am I deceiving Heaven?"</p>
<p>I think although the four Northeast provinces are lost, the hearts of the people of the four Northeast provinces are not lost. Seeing such a puppet photo will only make them feel more ashamed of losing their country and more disgusted with the Japanese's tricks to deceive the people of the Northeast Provinces, thus further arousing their determination to resist Japan. Hanging such photos is actually keeping a memorial of national subjugation for the 30 million people of the Northeast, and it cannot be said to be a very beneficial trick.</p>
<p>Therefore, the same photo can evoke different feelings. Some people feel good when they see a photo, while others feel disgusted. Some may not directly show disgust, but the disgust is indirectly reflected and continuously exposed. Therefore, people with good judgment cannot erase or deceive the truth, justice, and fairness. Hanging Pu Yi's photo in schools may not be a tool to stimulate people's resistance. "Let them hang it."</p>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— TT</p>
<p>One winter night, the north wind was howling, and snowflakes were floating in the air like cotton. The earth was eerily quiet. I hid in the house, tightly closing the windows and doors, sitting by the stove.</p>
<p>I never expected Lao Li to come to my place at this time. His face was flushed red by the wind, and his nose was running. I thought he would walk straight to the stove to warm himself up, but he stood still at the door, which was wide open. So I said:</p>
<p>"Close the door, it's quite cold."</p>
<p>The door was closed immediately, but he still stood there woodenly.</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you standing there for?" I said, standing up.</p>
<p>Only then did he step closer to the stove, reaching out to warm his hands, silently.</p>
<p>I stared at him in surprise. I was afraid he was having a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he squeezed my hand with effort and said very seriously:</p>
<p>"Lao Mu, shouldn't people have sympathy for each other?"</p>
<p>"Of course they should. For example, in such cold weather, if I don't even have a thin blanket, would you just watch me freeze to death while you have three or four quilts on your bed?"</p>
<p>"That's good, please come with me to my house for a moment." He jumped up and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"It's freezing, what would I do at your house?"</p>
<p>"See my house." He faced the door and forcefully dragged my hand.</p>
<p>There was no choice but to put on a big coat and walk with him down the street.</p>
<p>The wind rushed against us in gusts, and my face stung a bit. I lowered my head and walked with big strides, as if in a long-distance race.</p>
<p>The whole road was deserted, with only the two of us. Snow covered our bodies. Occasionally, one or two cars sped past us, and Lao Li cursed madly:</p>
<p>"Damn! Sitting in the car themselves, watching others get sprinkled with snow, they have no sympathy."</p>
<p>"Damn sympathy, they don't care if you freeze to death." My teeth chattered as I spoke.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!" Lao Li waved his hands in the air.</p>
<p>My heart trembled. "Lao Li must be having a nervous breakdown," I thought. When we reached the entrance of his apartment, he searched all over his clothes and pockets, but couldn't find the key. He pounded on the door anxiously. The landlady's helper was probably fast asleep, because it took a long time for the door to crack open.</p>
<p>"Damn, sleeping so comfortably, making people stand at the door... they have no sympathy." He started up the stairs, cursing as he went.</p>
<p>In his room, I found that the quilt on the bed was gone. I thought he had taken it to the pawnshop, and I asked with a smile:</p>
<p>"Lao Li, did you send the quilt to the poor people's bank?"</p>
<p>He opened the drawer, took out a slip of paper, and asked me to look at it. It read:</p>
<p>"Lao Li, heaven told me to steal your quilt, please forgive me! Your friend C."</p>
<p>"Lao Chen? That's outrageous, he's afraid of the cold, doesn't he think others are afraid of the cold? Go get it back from him," I said angrily.</p>
<p>Lao Li patted me on the shoulder, laughed, and then said:</p>
<p>"People should have sympathy for each other!"</p>

<h3>City Night</h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Eleven o'clock struck. Coming out of the Grand Theatre after seeing "My Fair Lady," I squeezed through the crowd at the entrance, took a long breath, straightened my collar, and walked along the cement sidewalk, tapping my toes on the ground to an off-rhythm beat, while calculating in my mind which road to take.</p>
<p>The neon lights on the store signs were glaring at the pedestrians, and the "big sale" banners in front of the shops drooped listlessly. People were slithering through the streets as if mad. One after another, sleek new Austin and Chevrolet cars crawled along the asphalt spine of the road. The tallest and grandest cubist buildings stood quietly in the sky, their peaks touching the firmament. The biting cold wind stirred up the dust on the ground. I couldn't help but shiver, shrinking my head desperately into my collar.</p>
<p>With a lonely heart, I wandered aimlessly along the road. The nightingales of the street were singing mournful songs!</p>
<p>— Young master! Gentleman! Give a copper coin to a poor person, let me buy half a bowl of porridge!</p>
<p>— Sir! It's so cold, walking in the wind, why not come to my house and sit for a while!</p>
<p>Caught off guard by this, I was startled. I twisted my body abruptly, broke free from their hands, ran a few steps, and mechanically turned my head to glance at them, seeing them grinning foolishly at me, no, it was an unnatural bitter smile!</p>
<p>Passing in front of a dance hall, the melodious music inside captivated my soul. A young couple twirled out of the door, arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder. Making a turn, they slipped into an ice cream shop.</p>
<p>Walking with a waltz-like gait, speaking with the flavor of a "dancing partner song," wearing a jade-green cheongsam, with a narrow waist, a pair of well-developed breasts, quivering in front of her chest, and a charming smile always hanging on the corners of her mouth. That teasing sensuality! Even an old monk would be tempted to return to the secular world.</p>
<p>By then I had strolled to another road, a road so deserted it was like a dead street. Here I couldn't see women's smiles, nor could I hear the songs of Ramona, only two or three rickshaw pullers, dragging empty rickshaws, wandered listlessly through the street.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, on another road, one after another motorcycle was revving its engine, with several "beep! beep! beep!" roars, carrying these dance-weary and drunken gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies back home.</p>
<h3>Fingernails</h3>
<p>— Lu Yinquan</p>
<p>Late autumn, a season as melancholy as lilac, a season most suitable for sitting quietly alone. There is no dazzling sunlight, and the gentle wind seems afraid to hurt people's delicate skin, only softly caressing. At this time, it is best not to browse books, you know? Books are a north wind that messes up a tranquil heart. If you are not used to it, you can smoke a mild cigarette. As for me, I am used to sitting quietly like this. I often put my fingers in my mouth and slowly grind the sharp corners of my nails with my teeth. In the grinding of my nails, I can happily let so much time slip by. This is indeed the greatest comfort for me.</p>
<p>Today, a late autumn afternoon as melancholy as lilac, I sat down by the dilapidated south window, ready to admire my fingers again. But when I pulled up my fingers, I was surprised. How come the pink curtex on my nails has faded? I felt a little depressed.</p>
<p>You know, why should I be depressed? This is pink Curtex, applied by my wife before I left home. At that time, I was lying on a rattan chair, habitually putting my fingers in my mouth, timidly fearing the approaching taste of separation. My wife floated in from outside and saw my hands, she said:</p>
<p>— Look, your fingers are so dirty, and you still put them in your mouth.</p>
<p>She took my hands and caressed them with affection. Caress them more, I thought, the moment of separation will arrive in an instant. But she didn't seem to feel anything and was still very happy!</p>
<p>— Let me wash them for you, and add some Curtex, okay?</p>
<p>Without calling the maid, my wife brought the washbasin herself. After the clear water had completely washed away the dirt between my nails, she took pink nail polish and applied it stroke by stroke. Watching her green onion-like slender fingers move slowly, I had never been so happy.</p>
<p>When leaving this gentle hometown, my wife said with some sadness:</p>
<p>— May this Curtex serve as a souvenir of our honeymoon! But now, it has only been a few days since I came here, and the nail polish that serves as a souvenir has faded like this, how can people not feel sad?</p>
<p>The setting sun has already been carried away by the returning birds, and I am still sitting blankly, staring at my fingernails. Have I lost a soft dream? I do not know. Only my mind is a little dazed. From now on, I will not admire my fingernails anymore, because they will give me sour memories. So I put my hands down, stood up, and ran to the gatehouse to check the mail.</p>
<p>I hope that in the big pile of letters in the gatehouse, there is a letter with a familiar, delicate handwriting.</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>Statement Regarding "One Dollar for Three Days"</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>The article "One Dollar for Three Days" published in the Amateur Mailbox the other day is slightly inconsistent with the facts, so I must make a statement to you.</p>
<p>Zhu Fumin is seventeen years old this year, and his height is the same as an adult, so he does not seem to be considered a child. When Mr. Zhu received the notice to come to our store, he stated that "he would try it for three days first, and if both parties agreed after three days, he would find a guarantor and be officially hired." But Mr. Zhu did not report this to his family, which caused a misunderstanding by Mr. Zhu's mother and brother, which of course our store cannot be responsible for.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Zhu's mother suddenly came to our store to make a scene on the evening of the day after the three days. Although our store explained to her the current application rules and that we had said "try it for three days first," she refused to listen and insisted that our store was cheating and slippery. It took about half an hour before she left.</p>
<p>Washing silverware is a task that our store needs to do every day. What Mr. Zhu wiped that day was not dozens of silver shields, but several silver cups. The silver cups were originally as shiny as mirrors, and only needed to wipe off some fingerprints and dust from the boxes. Mr. Zhu said that he had small blisters on his fingers from wiping, but Mr. Yu, who is now officially hired by our store, has been wiping for more than half a month and has not found any blisters. This is really strange.</p>
<p>The reason why Mr. Zhu was not hired, our store thinks it is unnecessary to explain further for Mr. Zhu's sake. In short, he is not suitable for our business, so we fulfilled the "try it for three days" agreement and dismissed Mr. Zhu, which of course cannot be said to be our store's mistake. Please accept my best wishes.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Looking at the Wilderness by Du Fu</p>
<p>West Mountain's white snow becomes three-tenths of the borderland; South Shore's clear river flows to the ten-thousand-mile bridge.</p>
<p>Within the seas, the winds and dust separate me from my brothers; At the edge of the sky, tears and sorrow burden my solitary self from afar.</p>
<p>I can only offer my declining years to my many ailments; I have not contributed even a drop in return to the wise dynasty.</p>
<p>Mounting my horse, I leave the suburbs, often straining my eyes; I cannot bear to see human affairs growing more desolate day by day.</p>
<p>Hearing of the Recovery of Henan and Hebei by the Official Army by Du Fu</p>
<p>Suddenly, from beyond the sword gate, news arrives of the recovery of Hebei; At first hearing, tears of joy filled my clothes.</p>
<p>Turning to look at my wife and children, where is their worry? Casually rolling up my books, I am wild with joy.</p>
<p>In the bright daylight, I must sing and indulge in wine; With youth as my companion, it is good to return home.</p>
<p>Then, following the Ba Gorge, I will pass through the Wu Gorge; Then I will descend to Xiangyang, heading towards Luoyang.</p>
<p>Climbing High by Du Fu</p>
<p>The wind is swift, the sky is high, monkeys howl in sorrow; On the islet, the water is clear, the sand is white, birds fly into the distance.</p>
<p>Boundless fallen leaves rustle down; An endless long river rolls on.</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles away, grieving for autumn, I am always a guest; A hundred years of age, plagued by many illnesses, I climb alone.</p>
<p>Hardships and bitterness, I hate my frost-covered temples; Frustrated and dejected, I have newly stopped my cup of turbid wine.</p>
<p>Ascending the Tower by Du Fu</p>
<p>Flowers near the tall tower wound the heart of the traveler; In ten thousand regions, there are many difficulties in this ascent.</p>
<p>The spring colors of the Jin River come from heaven and earth; The floating clouds of Jade Mountain transform ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>The North Star court will never change; The bandit invaders of West Mountain must not encroach.</p>
<p>Pitiable that since coming here, I have only visited temples; As dusk falls, I will idly recite the Liangfu Song.</p>
<h3>Radio News</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Radio Station (1040) broadcasts a special music program by the National Conservatory of Music for the Municipal Bureau of Education every Friday. It has long been noted by radio listeners because its music and singing are not as seductive as those broadcast by other groups. Moreover, letters from foreign countries are sent to the station, requesting that English reports be included so that foreigners can understand it, which shows the noble and valuable nature of the program. Today is another broadcast date. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to the broadcast time from 8:00 PM to 8:45 PM.</p>
<p>The China Hibiscus Music Chorus, due to its increasing development, has no choice but to recruit new basic members. Those who are interested in studying art can send a letter to the group at No. 91, West Gate Third Lane, to register immediately. An interview will be arranged on a suitable date.</p>

<h3>The Near Reality of Kay Francis's Loss of Sight (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mi Ji</p>
<p>"Since the doctor diagnosed that Kay Francis's eyes were burned, he had to operate. His method of surgery was to cut away the burned, transparent cornea because after the cornea was burned, it had already wrinkled and become dry and hard. So I waited until 'Hell's Angels' was finished and immediately went for the operation. The pain of the operation, of course, goes without saying. Since the operation, I have worn dark glasses almost every day for eleven months, waiting for my eyes to slowly grow a new membrane. The doctor absolutely forbade me from reading or using my eyes much during this nearly one year, except for the necessary short periods. 'Hell's Angels' was completed in November 1930. Less than six months later, the company sent me to perform everywhere. Of course, I couldn't always wear black glasses when I was on stage. But she kept her dark glasses on until she went on stage, and then took them off. As soon as she came off stage, she put them back on. But when she was on stage, the lights were shining up into her eyes, which was as painful as being pricked with needles. So every time I came off stage, my eyes were as red as blood, and tears streamed down. So I hurriedly applied some pain-relieving medicine, closed my eyes and rested until the second time I went on stage. But sometimes, I was rushing around, appearing on stage five or six times a day. There were also many local officials and important people who had to be met in person. It was really very painful."</p>
<p>Indeed, the pain suffered by the eyes can be said to be the most difficult of all kinds of pain in the various parts of the body, which all of us who have suffered from eye diseases know. And because the physical problem affects the mental pain, it is also the most severe with the eyes. In the past three or four years, Kay Francis has felt the danger of going completely blind at any time. So, what kind of pain she has suffered in her nerves can be imagined. But she, a brave woman, did not tell anyone, nor did she blame anyone. She said, "Many times, I really wanted to tell people about it. Because many friends saw me and waved to me from afar, but I couldn't see them at all. People thought I was arrogant. In fact, I didn't know at all. My eyes could go blind at any time because they are the most delicate part of the body, and even a small irritation can cause big problems. At that time, my eyes were like being on a plane flying through the clouds. Sometimes I could see very clearly, and sometimes my vision was blurred. Once blurred, it could last for an hour or several days, and then suddenly it would brighten up again. The time I was most afraid of was when a film was about to be finished because I was filming every day, and my eyesight was getting worse day by day. By the last few days, I was almost completely blind, but the work could not be stopped."</p>
<p>So when she finally got out of danger, her happiness can be imagined. She said, "That kind of joy cannot be described in words. You can imagine it slowly. First of all, I thought about how happy my mother would be when I told her what the doctor had told me, once and twice. I knew that she was worried about me even more than I was worried about myself. That was certainly one of the reasons why Kay suffered great pain but refused to say it.) My mother often told me not to make any more films, otherwise, I would not be able to save my eyes. But I didn't listen to her and insisted on continuing. I knew that if I really went blind, I would be too sorry for my mother. Secondly, I didn't dare to mention this to the company, for fear that they would force me to stop working. I also thought of many things that I enjoyed doing, but for the sake of my eyes, I couldn't do or do them often for many years. First of all, now I can read the books that I bought a long time ago but haven't opened yet. Secondly, I can watch as many movies as I like without being limited to a few movies that I have to watch. In short, it's like the beginning of a new life, the beginning of an unrestricted life. That is such a happy thing, you go imagine it!" (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of (Rebirth Affinity)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Journal of A Crime</p>
<p>—Nanjing—</p>
<p>From a new perspective, this film is an old-fashioned work in any case. However, the playwright or author is very cinematic, expressing their old ideas.</p>
<p>Yes, there is no new content needed by the times here; there is only the art of old ideas or the savoring of human relationships. We have seen many such works in movies and literature, and people often feel pleasant or sad to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Here, the playwright emphasizes the sadness of women who are old and losing their beauty. When they lose their husband's love, they often use their entire lives to win their husband's love. Therefore, Fang Shu (played by Rose Crichton) risked her life to kill her rival in love. But people always have a conscience - at least old-fashioned artists often seize the treasure of conscience to illuminate their works. Therefore, under the condemnation of conscience, Fang Shu went to confess several times, although her capital crime of murder had already been taken over by a kind-hearted and chivalrous bandit.</p>
<p>After that, the playwright was unwilling to have a female protagonist who had fully won people's sympathy for a murderer be sentenced to death, and also wanted to give her a perfect ending. After she had suffered a lot of torment for love, she then made her use her good conscience to save a child's life, resulting in her own injury. Eventually, she suffered nerve damage and completely forgot her sins, and lived a happy life with her husband on the Shanghai beach for the rest of her life. Finally, when her husband carefully taught her to read, she understood love in addition to mountains, seas, and the sun. - From these places, we can recognize the playwright's ideological form, and there is no need to add any other explanations.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the sadness, sorrow, and even anger of lost love here, and the psychological depiction of conscience condemnation, are highly cinematic, and successfully complete the success determined by the content. The director, whether in that section, whether it is the tone, or the atmosphere, all show William Keighley's mature skills. We are not very familiar with him, but here he does have amazing talent. Naturally, here we must explain that the mature skills of the playwright or the heroine very powerfully helped the director's success. In terms of the script, for example, he used a prisoner asking a stranger (Fang Shu went to jail to talk) for a cigarette, and used a thermometer to express Fang Shu's illness,... (there are countless examples) are very simple explanations of the story, and explain the surrounding environment. Rose's psychological expression is most obvious when she sees her rival's dog, and when she reads the news of the bandit's death sentence, and when she meets her husband for the first time after the murder. That excellent acting skill can be said to be unparalleled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this article cannot be written in more detail, other omissions.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Shows His Skills in Jinshan Port</h3>
<p>Jinshan switched from the stage to the screen. Because of his theatrical talent in the past, he took on the role of the male lead in Yueming Company's sound film "Madness" as his first voice on the screen. Yueming is currently shooting on location in Suzhou. The first filming location was Jinshan Port, and the first shot was Jinshan's scene, which can be said to be extremely coincidental. That shot was of Jinshan abducting his lover Wu Ling on horseback, with her sister Wu Lizhu protecting him from behind, but the enemy He Feiguang led his men to desperately chase after them. The gunshots were as dense as a string of pearls, and Jinshan took the lead, leaving the dust behind. Onlookers praised his good skills.</p>
<h3>Plum Blossom Petals</h3>
<p>...The Plum Blossom Film Company's production of "Song of the Rose" has been fully completed. It was sent to Beijing for review a few days ago. It will be released to the public in Shanghai soon. Yesterday, the company held a trial screening of another copy at the Cathay Grand Theater. The results were very satisfactory. The tension of the plot and the flexibility of the shots are rare in domestic films.</p>
<p>...Yin Yiqiu's "Song of the Rose" has been quite popular recently. Various dance halls and broadcasting groups are vying to broadcast and play it because its lyrics are sad and beautiful, and its melody is quiet and melodious, making it very pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>...The heroine of this film, Miss Pan Wenxia, performs very hard. The general public praises her as a beautiful star. She is talented and can be called a rising star. She previously recorded "Song of the Rose" for Victory Company, and the sound quality is excellent. It is now on sale.</p>
<p>...The second film "Three Friends" recently went to Wuxi as a whole to supplement location shooting. It will be completed soon. This film is co-directed by Yin Yiqiu and Chen Ningqiu. Good results are predicted. (Que)</p>
<h3>Prelude to "The Goddess"</h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>Being played with by people, being despised by society, under double oppression, a woman fights for her life.</p>
<p>In the arms of a man, she is a goddess, as filthy as dirt, trampled on by others, but in another context, she is a loving mother, as pure as the Virgin Mary, worthy of people's respect.</p>
<p>Contradictory life plunges her into extreme pain. However, society does not understand her. She endures all the ruthless scolding of the world and tolerates all the cruel insults, but in the end, she cannot protect her only beloved son.</p>
<p>Whose fault is this?</p>
<p>"The Goddess" is such a subject matter, handled by the emerging director Wu Yonggang, with an experienced set veteran joining the director's team. Even if it is a debut work, it will make people have absolute faith. (Que)</p>
<h3>Evolution of the Wheel to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Austin Motor Company Production Sound Film</p>
<p>"Evolution of the Wheel" is another new film produced by the British Austin Motor Company, following last year's sound film "Such Progress". The skill of its production and the brilliance of its content are even better than the previous film. The new film has now arrived here and will be released to the public at the Carlton Theater at 10:30 AM on the ninth of this month. All sectors are welcome to visit, and there is no charge. The new film is divided into: 1. Past and present view of the wheel. 2. Overview of the Austin General Factory. 3. Landscape film. 4. A glimpse of car climbing. The aforementioned three items are combined into five reels. The fourth item is a short film of two reels, titled "The Pinnacle of the World". Regarding the first section, the difference between the past and present wheels is always expressed by comparison. For example, the stagecoach, which was regarded as an important means of transportation in the past, is compared with the locomotive used for long-distance travel in recent times. The latter is agile and comfortable, while the former's driver sits proudly and ostentatiously parades through the city. Although it is also full of spirit, one can almost imagine that those who are in the car are not able to have a moment of comfort when they see its swaying and tilting state. Next, the 19th-century carriage and the early train with a high chimney are compared with the recently invented "Flying Scotsman" and long-distance electric sleeping cars in turn. The rate of speed is very different. At this point, the audience should feel the value of science even more, and need to catch up quickly. Regarding the second section, the overview of the general factory, how all the large and small parts of the Austin car are constructed and assembled is described in detail. The third section of the landscape film captures the scenery of various British villages and ancient buildings one by one, and the audience feels as if they are on the scene, and cannot help but feel relaxed and fascinated. As for the last two reels of short film, a glimpse of mountain climbing is the actual shooting of Austin "Seven" climbing the highest peak in Norway. All the processes are as if they are in sight. Rare scenery such as snow on the mountain peaks can also be fully enjoyed.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Mother-Daughter Affinity (Lady by Choice) (5)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jia</p>
<p>Alaban's beautiful eyes glanced around, and she couldn't help but be secretly surprised. She recognized Pansy as soon as she saw her. She walked straight up to Pansy and asked, "Haven't we met somewhere before?" Pansy smiled and pretended to have a southern accent, saying, "My dear, I don't think so. I have lived in Richmond, Virginia all my life... Not long ago, they invited me to live here for a while." After hearing this, Alaban couldn't help but secretly admire the old lady's acting skills, and remembered her roaring appearance in the midnight court that day, so she couldn't help but smile and said, "Then you must know Judge Daley, right?" Pansy also smiled back, winking at her, and slowly said, "Let me think... I know many noble people... Maybe I have met him." Alaban couldn't help but shout happily, "Okay, okay. Would you like to be my mother?"</p>
<p>That's how they made the deal. The news will also be published in the newspaper tomorrow. Johnny Mills seemed relieved when he saw the news, and sighed. Pansy had found a place to settle down. So he looked down and wrote a letter to Pansy to congratulate her. He felt that his responsibility was much lighter. On the other hand, after Paulaban brought Pansy home, she was happy all day long. She felt that Pansy was a very sensible person. She was very happy to buy clothes and so on for Paulaban, and she felt that it was worth it for the laughter Pansy gave her. The original plan she and Kendall had discussed was just to promote herself. But now, when Kendall occasionally mentioned their original plan and wanted Paulaban to send Pansy away, Paulaban became furious. But Pansy advised her instead, "Paulaban, what he said is not bad. I was originally a street wanderer, and I will go back to the street. And you don't have to worry, I will never say a word, saying that you took me out of the nursing home is just for publicity. I know you are a good person, and I will never hurt you." Paulaban reached out and shook hands with her, her voice with a sad tone, and said, "I know you are not afraid of anything, but I want you to stay here. May God bless your heart, I really liked you sincerely from the day you fought that salesman." Pansy asked in disbelief, "Really... Do you want me to stay here?" Paulaban said, "Of course it's true, don't worry." Pansy asked in disbelief, "Really... Do you want me to stay here?" Paulaban said, "Of course it's true, don't worry." Hearing this, Pansy cried with joy for a moment. Paulaban patted her back and comforted her, "Don't cry. I want you to laugh by keeping you here, why are you crying?" So they took out wine to celebrate their new collaboration. When Pansy raised her glass, her eyes couldn't help but contain a bag of tears, but she smiled with her mouth curved, "Congratulations on your happiness and fulfillment. All your actions are exactly the same as mine before." Paulaban looked at her, seemingly in disbelief, and said, "I'm afraid I can't compare to you."</p>
<p>Thus, their new friendship was built on respect and understanding, and it is rare for even true mothers and daughters to respect and love each other like that. Because Pansy deeply loved Paulaban, she had to protect all her interests. Therefore, she found out many of her manager Kendall's malpractices and places where he had deceived Paulaban. She told Paulaban and fired Kendall. From then on, Pansy began to plan for Paulaban, telling her to leave the humble life of the nightclub and become a true actress. Later, she borrowed some gambling money from Johnny Mills and went to the places she used to be familiar with, and won a lot of money back. She hired several famous teachers for Paulaban, teaching her singing, drama, and artistic dancing, all of which Pansy paid for herself. But she didn't dare to tell her where the money came from. She only said that a cousin of hers had died in Australia and left it to her, and Paulaban had to believe her. (To be continued)</p>
