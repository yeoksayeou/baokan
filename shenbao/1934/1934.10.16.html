<h3 id="c28">愛而近路火災慘劇 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>上海人烟稠密。民居麕集。一遇火警。便易成災。人命之犧牲。財産之損失。俱屬不貲。年來各區市政當局。有鑒於此。對於火政設備。力謀改良。即以第一特區（公共租界）論。二十餘年來區内災損失之百分率。已自一九○八年之四十。降爲一九三三年之○。九九。二者相差懸殊。不可謂非顯著之進步。然而如去年二月二十一日塘山路正泰橡膠廠之失愼。焚斃者八十一人。受傷者五十人。昨晨愛而近路倪順興棉花店之火警。焚斃者十四人。受傷者二十餘人。則仍爲駭人聽聞之慘劇。此固爲今日極嚴重之社會問題。而與全體市有切身利害者也。</p>
<p>試以上海特殊環境爲對象。而分析歷年水災之成因。則可得如左三點。</p>
<p>（一）普通住屋之擁擠　上海房金昻貴中産以下夙有「居大不易」之嘆。即如一上一下之單幢新屋。月租有貴至七十元者。影響所及。乃使居處擁擠之現象。無可避免。普通市房一幢。平均須住六家。而昨遭火災之杜姓棉花店。且住八家。客堂後。灶披。前樓。後樓。亭子樓。三層閣前樓。三層閣後樓等。棲止殆滿。同居數十人之起居。作息。飲食。排泄。莫不藉此方尺之地以行。此其有害於衛生。固不待言。而人多手雜。成災尤易。一旦禍起倉卒。雖在白晝。猶難一一奪門而出。而况適當清晨四時。豈能倖免。</p>
<p>（二）救災常識之淺薄　上海三百餘萬市民中能有消防與救災之常識經騐者。必居絕對少數。不幸而遇猛烈之火災。又不幸而缺乏外來之援助。則惟有束手待斃而已。即如去年第一特區居民因火災而喪生者。凡九十三人。此九十三人。無一非在火警處人員趕到之前而畢命者。夫自救不能。連論救人。苟遇不測。勢非同歸於盡不止。實情如此。可憐亦復可嘆。</p>
<p>（三）消防設備之欠缺　市内普通民房。湫隘擁擠。鮮有廻旋餘地。而消防設備。更見欠缺。房東特火險單爲護符。視此爲不急之需。而寄人籬下。覓取升斗之房客。自更無心力以注意及此。夫最新式之消防設備。所費奇昻。或爲事實所不許。若區區滅火藥水救火皮帶等之裝置。固屬輕而易舉者。亦竟概付闕如。則以囿於淺見。扼於惰心。習慣旣成。改革爲難。此眞如昔人所云。燕雀處堂。自以爲安。而不知棟宇之將焚也。</p>
<p>爲今之計。惟有（一）由市政當局嚴格取締「二房東」碎割住屋濫收租金之流弊。而其先决條件。則爲平準一般房租之上漲。（二）建築物檢查及火警預防之工作。如已行之有效。則其範圍仍須逐漸擴大。方法亦須更爲嚴密。平時尤宜注意於中下階級平民之住宅區。與工廠區。如以第一特區言。虹口。楊樹浦等處。向多火警。當爲今後努力工作之焦點。（三）喚起市民對於消防救災之興趣。本年八月初。上海縣農民敎育館。嘗在顓橋鎭舉行救火演習大會。成績斐然。可以如法推廣。又歐美各國。每年皆有所謂「消防節」者之舉行。屆期人人興高采烈。一致活動。或則檢視其家庭。或則清潔其居處。如發見有何可以引起危險之物。卽行除去。不稍遲疑。雖以一支火柴之微。亦必妥爲安放。個中寓在甚善之用意。在我亦大有模仿之價值也。</p>

<p>魯塞爾爵士之原文、首先分析巨大軍港之構成與其利用、據云、一座新式軍港之建築、其用處實有逾於純爲容納戰艦之便利設備、在太平洋方面有許多可容巨艦之便利海港、其中屬於英國者亦不少、但和平之際與戰時乃大有差别、一座新軍港之建築、在政治及軍事上之觀點、均爲其構築之主因、且謂、馬來半島末端之星加坡軍港、並非用以對付任何國家而設、其用意乃在企圖防禦、使任何各國、不敢以海軍力量、對付任何英國領土、及擾及英國之貿、但實言之、防守亦有賴於眞實之力量、此種力量、若用之於侵略、卽成侵略勢力矣、但侵略者之態度將若何、則非通常可以預測者也、蓋彼暗植其驚人之勢力表面儘　和平與友誼、但却時時準備襲擊也、太平洋方面、以海軍大國著稱者、厥爲美國與日本、吾人之和平政治家、將劃美國於作戰對象之外、因對美作戰、乃匪夷所思者、但余從未見過美國方面、有對英作戰、爲匪夷所思之言論、反之、則美國方面、衆口紛紜、以英國海軍爲比較之槍靶、此誠爲公開之反乎友誼之態度矣、不久以前、日本政界某要員、曾發表該國對中國所採之態度、該種聲言、殊太驚人、美國各大報、乃爲此事而標榜「吾人須與英國一致動作」、余對此標題、似覺大堪注意、蓋我人與所謂美國之高級報紙、相諗之程度太差故也、上述美報要求之背後意念、誰皆能加以推測、蓋美國海軍之要求、乃在使美國能有力對其自己之目標而發揮、而不與任何國共同動作、其次該美報復曾論及新加坡有被利用之可能性云、及後日政府換取和緩之態度、謂發表該宣言之外交人員、並非日政府授權發言者而彼所言、乃被誤解、此種言論、更引起美國之不安、而英國對此種言論所發生之不安、則較美國方面爲减、雖日本加以解釋、但終不能解釋美國之疑、是以對俄復交、乃由此促成矣、蓋俄國自身對於日本之海軍力量、絕無對付之辦法、但假如俄美聯合、則俄國之海參威將可作美國艦隊之根據地、然亦必以美國艦隊、能先行抵達該地、方能實現此項希冀也、星加坡離日本太遠、當日本與中國間發生戰事時、香港在猛烈攻擊之下、易受損害、此或即英國在華盛頓會議中、提出不在香港增建砲臺及設備武裝、而以對星加坡建築軍港爲交換條件之理由也、但星加坡築港之目的、顯爲對日本向澳洲推進海軍時、適當之攔擊地位、太平洋委任日本統治各島、常被認爲可守之潛艇根據地、但該島等無隠蔽之處、不易堅守、若遇空襲、則甚難抵禦矣、但若日本與任何海軍大國發生戰爭時、則或者能盡量防守、亦未可知也、據余（魯塞爾自稱）所見、該種戰爭、當發生於日本對華動作而不理列强干涉之時期中、一旦戰事開始、世界上任何强國、均不能用單獨之力量以驅逐日本出於中國領域、蓋日本將置其戰鬥艦於中國内海、而同時用戰艦隊以維持交通、余以爲驅逐日本海軍艦隊出中國領域、並非吾英人之事、倘國聯以神聖之態度執行國聯盟約、令英國艦隊執行該種任務、則日内瓦和平新宫、將於不久關門大吉、因此種事件並非吾人之責任、倘我人不如是瘋狂義俠、則吾人或可與「滿洲國」訂立第一條約、而吾人之商船不致死守、任其由銹而腐、但此屬另一論耳、日本之必發動世界大戰、如太陽之必升於明日乃斷然無疑義之事、但吾人之所希望者、當日本發動之時、不以向英國領土中找世界新地位爲捷徑耳、若中國眞因海盜及土匪之故、而不能集其全力於抵抗、雖英國在中國有鉅大之貿易利益、然吾殊未見英國應出而干涉也、蓋日本將以英國之不干涉而以保護英國在華之貿易利益爲交換之酬報矣、美國之目的、無論如何都是爲其自己之利益打算、美國或將再度反對日本對華更進一步之侵略、但余應重復斯言、美國係爲其自己利益打算耳、星加坡軍港眞正之任務、乃爲增厚維護英國領土利益之實力、該種利益、無須我人與其他列强合作、苟與其他列强合作、則其所負責任、當非初擬所及矣云云、</p>
<p>吾人綜觀上述魯塞爾爵士之言論、可知英美兩國距恊調之時機尙遠、而英國親日之觀念、仍極濃厚、最近英國之派遣歐洲實業考察團、及我國在國聯理事會之落選、其背景若何、明眼人當能見及也、</p>

<p>財部制定之稅率、（一）銀本位幣、徵出口稅百分之十、减去鑄費百分之二·二五、凈徵百分之七·七五、（二）大條寳銀等徵出口稅百分之十（三）平衡稅、以倫敦銀價與上海匯兌之比價、與當日照市核定之匯價差數、除繳納上述出口稅仍有不足時徵足之、昨日上午十一時半、據中央銀行折算公布平衡稅爲百分之四·七五、其計算法、係以上星期六倫敦銀價廿四又八分之三便士、乘法定數八一六五七四四、而將其和數一先令七便士又十六分之十五、减去上海當日十一時半市價一先令五便士又四分之三、其差數爲二又十六分之三便士、等於百分之一二·五、减去百分之七·七五、卽將平衡稅應徵數百分之四·七五、故銀幣應徵爲百分之一二·五、定銀等應徵數爲百分之一四·七五、</p>

<p>爭工起因　自從台江通航以來、上海赴閩之正班輪船、若招商之泳安·泳平·三北之萬象·靖安等船、均不往馬尾而改爲直達台江班、運閩貨物、與赴閩旅客、向來在馬尾用小輪駁載者、今悉無須擺駁矣、惟素來在馬尾恃各商輪裝卸貨件爲生之碼頭小工、今一旦改至台江、則此數百名勞工、實無以爲生、由是馬尾工人、及全體隨輪亦移到台江、仍謀工作、而爲當地工人所反抗、因之引起絕大之爭工風潮、</p>
<p>雙方衝突　上次招商局滬閩班輪泳平到福州、經馬尾往台江時、馬尾碼頭小工、卽隨乘該輪同往南台、謀占得台江碼頭之裝卸工作、詎知當地碼頭小工、亦有工會、以權利所在、豈容馬尾工人染指、卽拒絕由馬尾到台之工人上陸、並不許泳平輪開艙卸貨、雙方各不相讓、台江工人便糾衆上船、與馬尾工人發生極大之衝突、結果泳平輪中之貨、被阻未卸、不得已退歸馬尾、將貨物仍卸存馬尾棧内、</p>
<p>調解未成　此事發生後、引起重大之爭鬭工潮、不特妨害治安、抑且使商運停滯、關係頗大、當時台江工人堅不允馬尾工人至台工作、馬尾工人以生活所關、决意隨輪移台、台江工會乃下總罷工命令、以資對付、此事由雙方工會報告黨部、請爲主持、此本月八日事也、黨部調解之下、已决定台江工人占三分之二、馬尾工人占三分之一、台工表示滿意、而馬尾工人尙不願接受、致此事仍無結果、工潮迄未解决、</p>
<p>停航台江　昨日本埠各輪公司、得福州電告、台馬工人、雙方尙未諒解、工潮未已、台江各碼頭仍不能起卸貨物、商輪開台、恐遭阻滯、故招商局泳平輪、已决定不往台江、改赴馬尾爲止、裝閩貨物、亦祇可卸在馬尾、在工潮未解决前、滬閩輪暫時放棄南台云、</p>

<p>七、自力主義與各派主義之比較、自力主義與各派主義的比較、當另作詳盡專門的研究、現在祗用最粗淺的方法、加以說明、</p>
<p>（一）自力主義與自由主義的比較丨自由主義是以權利爲本位的、自力主義、則以義務責任爲本位、西洋有稱財産權爲財産自由、在法律上、什麽自由、便是什麽權的意思、自力主義是反自由的、不主張一個人把權看得太重、我的法律思想、是以義務爲本位的、（參看拙者現代憲政論、中華、現代法制概論、商務、）因此我的自力主義的精神、也是一貫的、（二）個人主義與自力主義的比較丨個人主義、也有牠的好處、也有牠的短處、希臘思潮主張自我的覺悟、這是個人主義的好處、現在因爲太放任、已發生了嚴重的病態、自力主義、便是以糾正這種病態而産生的、（三）自力主義與社會主義之比較丨自力主義與極端社會主義、不同的地方是社會主義抹煞個性、什麽都是社會的、没有個性的發展、俄國從前行極端的社會主義、結果個性無從發展、産業停頓、生産减低、因此又改用新經濟政策、自力主義雖主張以社會國家爲本位、但同時又重自我的覺悟、對於極端社會主義的發展也要加以糾正、（四）自力主義與民主主義的比較丨民主主義的特徵、重在國民個性之平均發展、並不是說一個共和國家、有了一個國會、使可以稱爲民主主義的國家、民主主義道個特徵、與自力主義、可說相同、因爲、自力主義、也要使每個國民能發展其優性然而所不同的、就是民主主義是以自由主義爲基礎、自力主義是不放任個人有絕對自由、要能够盡了他對於國家社會應盡的義務以後、才能享受自由、（五）自力主義與法西斯蒂主義的比較丨法西斯主義是一種行動主義、這一點我是表同情的、因爲處於現實的時間和空間、什麽都應該要雷厲風行的去做、不過我的自力主義是王道的、和法西斯主義的精神、有所不同（六）自力主義與聯責主義的比較丨聯責主義、呌Soldarisme、兄弟很相信這主義、兄弟的法律學基礎、完全建設、在聯責主義上的、牠把社會分作兩種現象、同時有兩種關攝、（甲）求同時社會聯立關係Solidorite　Por　Similitude、（乙）分工的社會聯立關係Solidorite　por　Division　du　tirvtal　對於社會現象的觀察不偏於個人、也不偏於社會、適得其中、像孔子之道、在求同的社會關係上、我們應該去爲社會努力、在分工的社會關係上、是應該各盡所能、發展各人的特長、忠於他的職守、所以聯責主義、可說是調整個人自由主義與極端社會主義兩種思想的中庸之道、自力主義和他雖不能說是絕對相同、但就思想的精神而論、可說是互相一致、</p>
<p>八、自力主義之優點與功能、自力主義的優點在那裏、他的用處在那裏、我們從自力主義與各種主義的比較裏可以看出、他是去各主義之短、而有各主義之長、他不是投機的、同時也没有投降那一派的思想、他是取各哲學思想之長而捨其短、所以自力主義可說是集了各種主義、及各種哲學思之大成、可以算是現代頂完美的一個主義、自力主義在理論上、這樣好、但與現在的社會合不合呢、中國現社會的病態、很多、而自力主義的所以可貴、正就在可以一一糾正這許多病態、譬如、國人之病在空言、虚驕、取巧、倖進、責人、依賴、怠惰、因循、畏難、苟安、卑性、爭權、自私、酣嬉、萎靡、消費、自力主義則主力行、務實、刻苦、努力、責己、求己、勤奮、勇敢、進取、耐勞、剛毅、忠公、奮鬥、堅忍、生産、一般國民的病態、都可以拿自力主義去糾正、我認爲自力主義、實在又是最適用於我國而最足以振發國民精神的主義、不但是在理論上完備而已、</p>

<h3 id="c182">書的普及版 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 關敬之</p>
<p>走過馬路，時常看見排排坐的商店陳設貨樣的大玻璃窗。各種各樣的貨色擺得很整齊，有時非常新奇。商店的窗飾術，近來是很有進步了。</p>
<p>然而在一排鬥奇炫巧的大玻璃窗中間，近來也時常看見有瞎了一隻眼似的收歇了的舖子；這在晚上年紅電光射得人眼睛生花的時候，尤其觸目。好像這是在表面看來還算繁盛的市塲上插了「不景氣」的草標。</p>
<p>然而又不知道從什麽時候起，這些瞎眼似的倒閉了的商店門前，平空添出許多臨時的書攤子，大都利用窗沿做書架，擺着翻版的舊小說，丨紅樓夢，水滸，三國志，儒林外史，大紅袍，岳傳，乃至曾文正公家書，秋水軒尺牘，桃花扇，浮生六記，應有盡有，甚至還有成親王之類的石印的字帖。</p>
<p>這一些書，大都是新式標點分段落，報紙印，牛皮紙的封面。定價倒也並不怎樣低，可是賣價却「放盤」到呌人難以相信：通常是一折再打九折。你化這麽三四毛錢，就可以得一部三國志了。</p>
<p>這是從前没有的！這樣「普及版」的盛行，一方表示了需要的廣大，但又一方也未必不反映著「不景氣」潮浪中書業的掙扎罷？我常常這樣想。</p>
<p>無論怎樣，「普及版」的流行，總是一件好事。在買書的人的錢袋一天天瘦小了的今日，「普及版」總是對於「文化」有益的東西。</p>
<p>我跟這些小書攤有過好幾次的交易。很使我欽佩的，是這些「普及版」的印刷倒也不見得壞。白話的舊小說如三國志之類，簡直没有什麽排錯的字，而標點也大致妥當。不過文言的世說新語之類，錯字却比較多了。這也難怪。「不景氣」時代的這樣的「普及版」，爲了成本關係，當然不能聘請「通人」做校對呀！</p>
<p>最近，「普及版」的應用又擴充到非常「硬性」的大部書了。先有了鋅版縮印的二十五史的廣告，接着又有排印的二十六史的廣告。預約價是越來越便宜了。二十五史的樣張，我們見過，照相鋅版印，錯字倒無須顧慮，只嫌字體太小了一點，只能備查，不便誦讀。二十六史呢，還没見到樣張。但旣係排印，想來要用六號字來排罷，字體不算太小，可是，可是，看了世說新語「普及版」之類的錯字太多，我忍不住要想到這普及版的二十六史不知是延聘了幾位老先生戴了老光眼鏡在細細校對呢？</p>
<p>校對這件事，絕不是機械工作。「正史」之類倘使用「機械工作」看一字對一字那樣校出來，難保不閙多少笑話罷？「普及版」的必要條件總也得是「讀得下」罷？</p>
<p>不知怎麽，我覺得照相機的「眼睛」總比人的眼睛可靠！</p>
<h3 id="c183">有刺花鼻子更好 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>感謝記述鼻子故事的ＮＶ果戈理先生和翻譯這篇作品的許遐先生。由於他們底可敬的工作，鼻子先生被介紹和我們愉快地認識了。</p>
<p>我記得在張天冀做的鬼土日記裏，也曾把鼻子當做一個要小心對付的東西。作者爲對人們把生殖器看成污穢罪惡的機關這一觀念嘲笑，便在鼻子身上栽下一個不衛生的罪名，使在鬼土裏生活着的人們，不論男女，一概戴上鼻套。丨丨不過這同時又使我們看不見牠的尊容，抱着無從認識的遺憾了，我憎恨這種苛刻的習慣。</p>
<p>可是以八等文官可伐羅夫儆主人的，五等文官鼻子先生用甚麽態度接待我們呢？他光明磊落地在聖彼得堡的大街上坐着馬車跑來跑去。爲避免拙劣的轉述，我還是做點抄寫的工作好吧：</p>
<p>「我怎麽去接近呢，」可伐羅夫想，「看一切！那禮服，那帽子丨丨總之，看起一切打扮來，一定是五等文官。畜生，這眞糟透了！」</p>
<p>他開始在那紳士旁邊咳嗽了一下，但鼻子却一動也不動。</p>
<p>「可敬的先生……」可伐羅夫竭力振作着，說，「可敬的先生……」</p>
<p>「您貴幹呀？」鼻子轉過臉來，回答說。</p>
<p>「我眞覺得非常奇怪，極可敬的先生……然應該知道您自己的住處的……可是我忽然在道里看見了您……什麽地方？……你自己想想看……」</p>
<p>「對不起，您說的甚麽，我一點也不懂……請您說得清楚些吧。」</p>
<p>「敎我怎麽能說得更清楚呢？」可伐羅夫想，於是從新振作，接下去道，「自然……還有，我是少佐。一個少佐的我，没了鼻子在各處跑，不是太不像樣麽？……（抄者省去幾可）……請您自己想想看……眞的是没有法子了，我實在……（這時可伐羅夫少佐聳一聳肩膀）……請您原諒吧……這事情，如果照着義務和名譽的法律說起來……不過這是你自己很明白的……」</p>
<p>「我一點也不懂，」鼻子回答說，「還是請你說得清楚些罷」</p>
<p>「可敬的先生，」可伐羅夫不失他的威嚴，說，「倒是我不懂您的話是什麽意思了……我們的事情是非常明白的……如果您要我說……那麽，您是丨丨我的鼻子嗎！」</p>
<p>鼻子看定了少佐，略略的皺一皺眉。</p>
<p>「您弄錯了，可敬的先生；我是我自己。我們之間，不會有什麽密切關係的。因爲看您衣服上的扣子，就知道您辦公是在别的衙門裏的。」說完這，鼻子就不理他了。</p>
<p>說實在話，果戈理太不負責任了。鼻子即使有别的任務，却怎好到處亂跑呢？而且，可伐羅夫怎麽能够確認五等文官就是自己的鼻子呢？所有的人們都不大能够辨認自己的鼻子底形狀，即使他整天照鏡子。丨丨這才是我們知道的事情。鼻子陡起來不認主人的，究居少數。</p>
<p>照常識說起來，人們底鼻子是遠遜於狗的。在「野性底呼聲」那本書裏，我們看到狗靠了鼻子，便能够感到空氣裏最輕微的震動，因而知道甚麽地方有敵人，别的地方有食物，或明天天晴或下雨。但是人底任務狗煩難得多：那一條路子有利可圖，那一種行爲可博主人歡心，那一個妙計能毫不費力地制人死命，那一番週旋會穏固自己的勢力，顯耀自己的名譽，發揮自己的本能，而尤其困難的，是怎樣才做得到省力，但容易成功；像文人，不必費冩作的勁兒而永覇文壇丨丨這一切，都需要一個能嗅能鑽的鼻子，比狗還厲害的鼻子，才辦得到。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，人可以把鼻子訓練起來，放出去，朝人身鑽不過的地方鑽，做出「哼哼」的，又能够逢迎又能够蔑視的聲音，這是容易想像的。而且比可伐羅夫多點智慧的人還能裝飾牠，不讓牠生滯氣（廣州話呌暗瘡），就像野蠻人一樣，在那上面刻些花紋。這樣就更有媚力，更易辨認和管理，不至於像五等文官那麽荒謬，猖獗了。</p>
<p>我們祖先底一切都比我們完善而且聰明，目前有不少人在證明着，對於這身軀之中最先的一部份底改革，也可以這樣提倡吧。</p>

<h3 id="c184">小麥的生活和起源 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 茂生</p>
<p>小麥是世界上最重要的食糧，許多地方的中國人雖是喫米的，但也兼喫麥，麥仍然種的很多；常有的看見。你如果取幾粒麥放在濕土上，當見它漸漸吸收水分而脹大。幾天之後，麥粒的一端便抽出白嫩的細根來了。最初出來的根常常是三條，丨不像大麥的常常是五條，也不像豆的只有一條。根是從胚的下部長出來的，這時候胚還在麥粒裏，丨側臥在麥粒一端的角落裏。不久胚的上端也穿出來了，於是看到緑色的嫩葉。胚旁還有一片盾狀的器官，留在麥粒裏，多數植物學家公認它是繼相的子葉，留在麥粒裏，吸收裏面的養料用的。等到幼苗能够自立時，麥粒内的養料亦已用完，那變相的子葉也就枯萎，麥粒就和幼苗脫離了關係。</p>
<p>麥發芽後，不久下部漸漸添生細根，上部添生緑葉，莖也長起來了。它的第一片葉子，形狀像矛頭，生的不完全，第二片也是這樣，以後方才生出發育完整的葉子來，如果有適常的陽光，空氣，土中的養分也不缺乏，它就長大起來了。</p>
<p>長大的麥，田中常有的看到，它生着空心有節的稈，節上生着狹長像茅草葉的葉子。隨後，稈上生出穗來，穗上生着許多小花。那小花是生得極細小而且簡單。每朶小花，外面包着兩片殻，這是和普通的花的蕚片相當的部分。裏面更有極小的兩片小片，幾乎非用擴大鏡看不清楚。這大概是和花瓣相當的部分，但是已經退化，變的很細小。接着是三個雄蕊，生着長的花絲和盛花粉的部分，稱爲藥。中央是一個雌蕊，上去兩個柱頭，分裂成羽狀，是承受花粉的部分。</p>
<p>穗長大了，花也成熟了，它就展開來。開花的時間，大概隨着氣候的不同會有遲早，但據記載上所說，常常在晴天早晨四點鐘的時候。經過一兩小時後，它又閉合了。開着的時候，如有微風吹來，把花粉帶去，落在他花的柱頭上，子房裏的胚珠便受了精；不曾受精的花，閉合後，便由自己的花粉來受精。大多數的植物，須受精之後纔能結實，像有些棉子及芭蕉，不受精的果，也會長大，但是裏面不含種子的。</p>
<p>它的胚珠長大起來了，不但長成了一個幼小的胚，並且生成了將來給它芽生時做養料的胚乳。胚乳大部分是小粉，此外還有蛋白質及脂肪。麥粒黄熟後，便成了下種時那樣的麥子。</p>
<p>麥是屬於所謂一年生的那一類植物的，它在一年之中一次開花結實之後便枯死。雖然許多一年生的植物，麥也是這樣，如果阻止它開花結實，也就能生活一年以上，但是在普通情形之下，是只生一年的（其實只有幾個月）。可是開花一次的植物不一定都是一年生。有些植物，例如俗稱小鷄草，古稱蘩縷的小草，很快的生長，開花，結子，死亡，一年能够生數次。許多植物，如蘿蔔或蕪菁，今年芽生，把養料貯藏在根部和莖部連合而成的膨大處，供明年開花結實之用，有些竹數十年後，一次開花枯死，龍舌蘭，生長在本土即墨西哥，八年到十年以後便開花，生在地中海岸，須二十到五十年才開花，生在别的地方開花的年代還要多些，因此有「世紀的植物」的名稱。但它一生也只開花一次，和桃李等每年開花，連開多年的植物性質各異。</p>
<p>麥貯在麥粒裏供胚生長用的養料，是人類主要的食糧。這些養料是由葉子利用了空氣中的炭氣，土中的水分和礦物質，賴日光的帮助，在含緑色物質的部分造成的。世界種麥的地方約佔四十萬方哩。幾乎從北極圈到赤道的高地，各處都種麥的，一年中隨能看到黄色的麥粒。</p>
<p>栽培得這極廣布的麥，發源的地方却至今還未明瞭。麥有許多種和變種，植物學者把它分爲三類，第一類麥粒很小，營養價值很低，現今種植的已極少，這一類稱爲安康（Einklrn）。第二類略佳，稱爲安美Emmer）。第三種即可做麵包的麥。第一種野生的見於小亞細亞各處。第二種的野生者見於叙利亞，大概在叙利亞南部到摩押山脈。只是廣栽培的一種小麥至今不見過野生種，英國的農業植物學者普息伐爾（Percival）曾提議過，說它的祖先當是安美和别種草類Aegiops　Ovata或Ae.Cylindrica）的雜種，近年别一個植物學者該芝（Gates）說，小麥當是野生的安美和野生的安美之雜種。據各種考察，說它的最早的培養地是在亞洲西南部的地方。</p>
<p>一九二六年，我國的植物學者伐維洛夫（Vavilov）發表了「栽培植物起源的研究一一文，也說小麥的最初培養地當在亞洲西南部。伐維洛夫反對早先的植物學家特康沱爾（de　Conodlle）的意見。特康陀爾的名著「培養植物的起源」出版於一八八二年，說培養植物的發源地當在生着該種植物的野生種相近之處，伐維洛夫說只能從培養變種最多之處定爲培養最早之處。小麥的培養變種最多之處首推阿富汗東部，其次是波斯，再次是外高加索。照伐維洛夫的意見，阿富汗是小麥最早的發源地。波斯種植也早，外高加索是「次中心地」，這便是說其地由各方輸入的。别的研究家，對於小麥起源於亞洲西南部之說是一致的，只是對於細點，略有異議，有時研究家以爲外高加索當是小麥起源的最早中心地，阿富汗似非最早的發源地。波斯也許爲最早的栽培地，但不能確定。關於小麥最早的發源地的考查，因爲問題太複雜，今日的研究家間，意見不能一致也是意中事，但將來再經過一個時期的考察，自能趨於一致的。</p>

<p>「是呀！這是做不得的！」</p>
<p>「是呀，這是做不得的。」</p>
<p>一屋子那麽的懇求聲音。馮文先生又感到自己是被别人立過正舉過槍的人了。</p>

<p>開暘麻皮底媽却獨持異議。</p>
<p>「哼」放平了酒杯，木仁老笑了。「講理，壽夫大砲也應該二十元的。壽夫大砲不曾要錯！」</p>
<p>「什麽！壽夫大砲也應二十元一月。」大生先生轉過臉來，幾乎發跳，死盯住木仁老。「那麽你去出這二十元！」</p>
<p>「捐來的錢不是有多嗎？」木仁老偏要强。</p>
<p>「供應費可不要嗎？丨丨一個是願意去的，一個是捉去的。便是一個錢不給，他又向誰去咬卵！（到此，大生先生也不文明了。）倒是十五元補貼錯了！他媽的，眞不是人！」</p>
<p>「所以啦！阿召二十元，阿召是自己願意去的呀……」馮文先生接了脫下去，但這話還不曾說完，忽然夾進一陣女人底哭呌聲！</p>
<p>「我們不要這二十元賣命錢呀！你給我阿召還來！你給我阿召還來！」</p>
<p>接着又走進了一個披頭散髮的哭得淚人兒似的女人。</p>
<p>那是阿召的女人！</p>

<p>▲市敎育局長潘公展在本市第三區敎育會會員大會演講</p>
<p>怎樣領導中小學生走向生産的途徑呢、換句話說、怎樣可以使他們有生産的興趣、智識、技能、和習慣呢、最重要的、是要一般中小學担任課程的敎師、大家願負責任、如果能够把中小學的課程敎材、敎學方法、和訓練目標等等、都拿生産來做中心、設計改革的方法、由試騐而實行、而推廣、則敎師們領導中小學生走上生産的途徑、是並不煩難的、有許多人說、敎師敎的科目不同、敎數學、物理、化學、生物學…理科方面的敎師、和敎勞作、和農工科目的敎師、接近自然界固然可以領導學生們去生産、但是敎公民、國語、社會…文科方面的敎師、祇知道敎學生識字、寫字念書作文、讀讀歷史地理、與生産技能没有關係呀、說到這裏、我就要提及敎材、我認爲現在的敎材實在非根本改革不可、前幾天我到江灣鄕下某小學去視察、看到五六年級學生上歷史課、講的是十字軍東征、十字東征、在世界文化的流傳方面固然有影響、可是對於我們中國鄕村的兒童還未必見得有什麽關係罷、什麽呌十字軍、爲什麽要東征、敎師能够詳細講嗎、十一二歲的鄕材兒童能聽得懂嗎、中國歷史上的幾個朝代還弄不清楚、却要他們牢記什麽馬基頓的亞歷山大等等的外國名字、究竟是什麽一回事、就拿十字軍東征的一件事來說、基督敎與回敎之爭、耶路撤冷王國的建立與滅亡、前後東征七八次的成敗、以及影響於東西文化的溝通如何等等、在大學裏面敎起來、可以編好長篇大論的講義、用口頭來講至少可以講一兩個鐘頭、學生們筆記起來也可以記下幾百幾千字、這是一件材料很多的史實、但在小學敎科書裏面、祗用兩三句話包括了一切、試問那一位敎師有這個本領、祗用兩三句話可以呌十歲左右的兒童明瞭十字軍東征、勢必照書念一遍、能够呌兒童記住就算了、這種敎材與兒童的切身生活有什麽關係呢、所以我們要講歷史、就要注意與中小學生本身的關係、並且要注意到生産、譬如某一地方先講這地方的鄕土歷史、鄕土方面生産技術的演進、次購中華民族生産的能力和生産的方法、以前是怎樣、逐年的演化是怎樣現在是進步或退化、譬如神農敎人耕稼、嫘祖敎民養蠶、三代的井田、商秧的廢阡陌……這都是與人民生計有關的史實、應該特前提出、可以使學生知道我們歷代祖宗以前怎樣生産、怎樣改良、……生産是如何的寳貴、如果這樣、儘管敎歷史、而他所敎的歷史却與生産覺得很有關係、同樣、敎國文的也可以採取關於生産的材料、例如叙述木匠做桌椅的取材和做法、描寫郊外旅行看到田間棉花的感想參觀紗廠等等的紀事、招募工人的通告、購買戽水機器的募捐啟、……一方面敎他們識字學文章、一方面却有實在的用處、給中小學生一個對於生産很重要的印象、不能說與生産没有關係、旣然如此、爲什麽不仿效現在小學校的單元設計、始終以「生産一作爲中小學裏一貫的敎材中心呢、此外、對於課程的分配也大有關係、假使照現在各中小學的課程分配、恐怕學生丨丨尤其是小學裏的兒童丨丨將感到没有時間作生産的實騐、勞動的工作、因爲功課名目繁多、分量太重呀、所以我們如果認爲生産敎育是今後應走的路、那麽應該請敎師大家來下一個决心、把敎材的選擇和課程的支配澈底的改造一下、</p>
<p>我在幾個月以前、對於這敎材和課程問題、曾經想到過一些意見、現在也姑且舉出來作一參考、我以爲、敎材是要在兒童生活傾向中、經過審愼的客觀的篩子才採爲中心敎材我們的課程、就是「整個的生活」、也就應在「生活」中施「生産敎育」、在小學裏、對於那已往分量繁重的分科敎學法必須加以反對、因爲兒童心理與成人不同他們需要的不是呆板的講經談玄式的課堂生活、乃是有興趣的活動、敎師應該隨時利導兒童的興趣、滿足他們求知的慾望、譬如小孩子很喜歡養鷄、養生物、而他們都有喜歡發問的天性、一定就懷疑着、怎樣生出來的、爲什麽生得這樣好看、給什麽東西他吃、有什麽用處、丨丨他就要求找到先生、求先坐給他滿意的解决、這時就是設計的做學敎的動機開始、以後就可以敎他實地喂養、讀小鷄的故事、食料價值和産蛋數量的計算、冩「小鷄吃白米」的字、做「老鷹捕小鷄」的遊戲、唱「小小鷄」的歌丨丨這許多從養鷄的動機起、一直到滿足兒童的慾望止、不是無緣無故的把智識灌注給兒童、始終是兒童自己生活的需要、也就是指示了他生産的途徑、是從做上學、做上敎、是眞學、是眞敎、是用設計的精神的學做敎的方法、使兒童從實際生活中得到生産的興趣、智識、技能、和習慣、這纔是小學裏的「生産敎育」、（未完）</p>

<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>社會的習俗，相沿旣久，便積重難返，一時不容易改革！像中秋的「賞月」，吃「月餅」，已經熱閙過了。現在到了重陽，大家又記得「登高」，和吃「重陽糕」的玩意見，可是小子目擊現狀，對於這兩件事，來貢獻一點小建議，雖說事涉遊戲，但並不哼那句「娛樂不忘救國」的口號，料是無妨的。</p>
<p>▲登高改乘飛機　登高的典故，是說植景重九日有災難，費長房令他全家，佩萸囊，登山避災，得免於禍。但是現在環顧全國，眞可說遍地災荒，荆棘滿途，就是山巔水涯，恐怕也將波及！那末避災之方，惟有乘坐飛機，直上雲霄，翺翔太空，或者可避免於萬一吧。</p>
<p>▲吃糕應改吃餅　「劉郎不敢題糕字，虚負詩中一代豪，」這是說劉夢得重九做詩，因六經中無糕字，就此擱筆的一回事。至於吃重陽糕，始於何時，恕小子不能答覆，不過年年重九，年年吃糕，結果社會現狀，反弄得如此糟糕！不景氣，今年不妨換換花樣，改爲吃餅，因爲俗諺只有糟糕，却從無糟餅，而且餅是圓的，也可說寓有圓滿的意思，吃了它，也許殘缺的事物，得有重圓的希望哩。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>我坐在脚划船上，到内地的一個親戚家裏去，使我發生了無窮的感想。</p>
<p>是一雙小小的木船，上面兜了緑色的篷子，兩頭是尖形的，船夫用槳來波動水浪，於是這艘小船，漸漸的前進了，這便是現在内地將要淘汰而没有淘汰的「脚划船」。</p>
<p>據說，在二三十年之前，脚划船的生意，還是很好的，後來輪船事業，漸漸的勃興，於是人們便享受了更高一層生活幸福，大家便喜歡趁輪船，而不歡迎這脚划船了。所以現在船中的趁客，還是一些年老的人，和喜歡省幾個錢的農夫農婦，年輕的小夥子，非出於不得已，是不肯趁這脚划船的，因此，脚划船的主人，生活便受了打擊，漸漸地更感覺到「生之艱難」了。</p>
<p>「不錯，物質文化，一天一天的向前推進，脚划船打倒了帆船，輪船又打倒了脚划船，脚划船的應該淘汰，似乎是一定的道理，有一個年老的趁客說：但是，我想：淘汰了以後，一般船夫們的生活，將如何的替他們謀解决，這不是要成爲問題了嗎？</p>
<p>現在主持脚划船的人，也起來奮鬥了，在船上也裝起機器來，名之曰「機器脚划船」，固然，用機器來開駛，確是迅速得多，但是，内地的脚划船，能裝得起機器的，實在是寥若晨星，於是這許多裝不起機器的脚划船，終於免不了淘汰。</p>

<p>▲李二　大概他排行第二，老同學們便呼他李二。馬路上一見，他便嘮嘮叨叨地述說他的得意事件，一遍又一遍，你不耐煩地要告辭了，才轉到别事上。他有時故意呌一部人力車，呵叱了他一番，使他去了。有時跨進食品公司，那一樣嘗了些，這樣嘗了些，結果，生意一些没成功。這都是他使給你看的手段。</p>

<p>現在這一部份已是坍毁得不能再有什麽用處了，而本來用以隔絕我們的山海關，也像大門一般似的開直了，恐怕再過幾十年，或幾百年之後，人們對於古代帝皇建築這條萬里長城的原意，一定會漸漸地糢糊，以致於全部忘却！」</p>
<p>眞的，萬里長城已逐漸走上傾坍的路上來了，尤其是山海關附近，坍得格外的迅速，已現出了一個很大的缺口；京奉路的軌道就在這缺口裏很寬裕地通過。至於坍下來的許多材料呢？從前想必是費了許多財力搜集來的，現在却因無人看管，只要一坍下來，便給附近居民檢去，作爲蓋屋子的材料了；甚至没有坍倒的也有人去偷拆下來，搬回自己家裏去。像這樣值得寳貴的古代建築物，一任它如此破壞，傾毁，無怪太后要不勝感慨系之了！</p>
<p>現在，我們所站着的地方已是中國本部和東三省中間的交界綫了，只要穿過長城，外面便是我們的祖宗以前從那裏入主中原的發祥之地。我不知道太后到了這所在，心上可有什麽感想没有？伊似乎對於那遼東灣的一泓碧水，看得最出神。丨丨二千年來，這裏的海水，不分晝夜的冲洗着長城的盡頭，以致於使它自動的坍毁，像一個老年的人一樣地漸漸死去。</p>
<p>太后慢慢地又把伊那一雙注視在海水上的眸子，移往高處的幾座山峰上去；這些山峰，都像是已被判處徒刑的囚犯一般，給人們長期拴鎖着，它們的鐡鍊，便是那萬里長城。（一五○）</p>

<p>提起了列寧，也許誰都知道的，他是蘇聯的革命偉人，俄人的尊敬列寧，恰和我們尊敬中山先生一樣。在桑瑪拉地方，是列寧的故居，有一所屋子，他自一八九○年至一八九三年時代居住在裏面的，現在這所屋子已被公家在下層設一圖書館，而在樓上便陳列了好多列寧的遺物，蘇聯的民衆不拘遠近，每天有人在成羣結隊而來一覩那領袖的故居。</p>

<p>賭城的衰落</p>
<p>蒙脫卡羅是法國有名的花都在那邊賭風之狂，甲於全球，賭金之館鉅，一夜百萬金，眞是駭人聞聽。但自世界開始閙了經濟恐慌之後，蒙脫卡羅這著名的賭城，景象也爲之一變，日見衰落了，俱樂部相率關門，賭館十九停閉，大有瓦解之象。以前普通的窮小子，到蒙脫卡羅去休想，走進規模宏大，富麗堂皇的賭場，但現在爲挽救此危局起見，自十一月一日起，所有的旅客，將任何人可免費進内賭博，不必買門票了。</p>
<p>俄皇的行宫</p>
<p>彼得奥夫宫距離列寧格拉很近，是俄國著名的一所皇宫，建築的宏偉，裝飾的富麗，不可一世，確是藝術的結晶。而現在，已由列寧格拉市議會主持之下，完全改建一新。這皇宫原初由彼得大帝建造，極盡奢華，凡是用金錢所能買到的裝飾品，點綴品，在宫裏無所不有，無所不備。舊時俄國歷代帝王，都作夏日避暑的行宫，革命之後，改爲博物館。大戰的時候，由布爾什維克主義者派兵守衛以防此歷史建築有人破壞，所以能够不受絲毫損害，就因那時防備的周密呢！</p>

<p>天下雨而雨裏會有活魚，也許是一件没有聽見過的事情吧？但最近據蒲地柏息傳來的消息，說是匈牙利達爾伯地方，某一天下雨的時候，下了好多的鮮魚下來。在一陣狂風暴雨中，千萬條的小魚夾雜在雨點裏，落到地上，不多幾時，地面上已到處是小魚了。這件事情引起了甚多人的注意，結果把落下的魚，送到蒲地柏息的自然學博物館中加以研究。</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>大衆提倡國貨，報紙鼓吹國貨，國貨年，國貨廉，救亡圖存，繫乎國貨。</p>
<p>欲使社會普遍購用國貨，一方面應詳查國産，另一方面則須獎勵製造。國産雖富，原料雖豐，但工業不振，出品無多，縱欲得國貨以抑外貨，結果仍爲實際上所不能辦到。他姑不談，請言電信。</p>
<p>電信自開辦迄今，已具五十餘載之歷史。一覘電信機械，大半均屬舶來。彼以機來，我以幣往，漏巵之數，歲有可觀。至於綫路材料，銅綫鐡綫未能自製，固無論已。我國素號産磁，而隔電子係屬磁質，屢在景德鎭仿製，終以成本所關，未能充分改良，供諸實用，所謂眞正的國産，恐祇有沿綫之木桿。碩果僅存，言之可嘅。</p>
<p>從事於電信事業之人士，與記者所交接者，往往聆其言論，莫不對於國貨具有崇拜之心理，但機械製造，從前交部素鮮切實提倡，而對於國産能適用於電信者，亦少詳細之調查。個人方面，縱有才智，恒苦於試騐設備之缺乏，經濟力量之薄弱，終於望洋興嘆，故電信上所用之國貨，截至近今，仍寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>現在之交通部，提倡國貨，進行頗力，前旣通令所屬，服用國貨，兹復通飭所屬，調查國産。調查所及，將使各種適合於電信用之國産材料，搜集靡遺，如此，電信之將來，苟有國貨可以抵補，即使所費稍增，亦將舍舶來而用國産。至若製造事業，尤希望與工商界技術家通力合作，俾電信材料入於自製之一途。</p>
<p>社會人士，工商各界，其或對於國産電信材料方面，有所貢獻，對於自製電信材料方面，素多研究，期國貨之普及，爲電界所歡迎，則聞風興起，此其時矣！</p>
<h3 id="c228">便利民衆通信新建設之一車站郵電代理處之創設 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 開第</p>
<p>我們每到各地的火車站上一望，每天可以看見熙來攘往的旅客，男女老少，不知有多少。在這一羣一羣的旅客當中，因有急事需要拍電寄信的人們，一定不在少數；然而我們把全國各車站來觀察一下，那一個車站有便利旅客拍電寄信的設備呢？車站上雖也有鐡路電報房的設置，可是他們並不與當地電局有接綫的聯絡，他們是專爲辦理車站公務而設，凡已設有電報局的地方，他們礙於電局定章不能代旅客收拍各種國内電報。所以車站上旅客，遇有急事要想拍電寄信，除寄普通信件有郵筒可投外，非要尋找當地的電局郵局不可，而電局郵局的地址，大都距離車站很遠，這對於車站旅客是都麽不便利的一件事啊！交通當局爲要彌補這種缺點，爲一般車站上旅客便利打算，最近特與鐡道部商定了合作辦法，乃有一種「車站郵電代理處」之創設。兹將車站郵電代理處的内容，約略向讀者縷述一下：</p>
<p>一·車站郵電代理處，附設在各地車站内最適當的地方；</p>
<p>二·車站郵電代理處的事務，是由電局郵局委託路局代辦，由路局指定人員兼辦；</p>
<p>三·車站郵電代理處的辦公鐘點，與所在地車站尋常辦公時間相同。</p>
<p>四·車站郵電代理處的職務規定如下；（甲）銷售郵票，收寄各項普通掛號快遞航空郵件，封發外埠郵件總包。（乙）接收旅客及公衆交發之國内或港澳電報，並投送國内外來報。（以送交車上旅客之電報及未設電局地方各車站收到之電報爲限）</p>
<p>五·郵資報價，概照郵局電局定章收取，不另加收額外費用。</p>
<p>六·各鐡路重要車站，與當地電局間，均用電綫接通，凡在往來電報較多之處，雙方用莫爾斯機聽聲機或印字機工作，其餘各處，設電話機，電報由電話上傳送，或通知電局派差收取。（以特别冗長之官軍電報及容易錯誤之洋文電報，或路局本身報務特别繁忙爲限）。</p>
<p>以上是車站郵電代理處内部組織的大概情形，倘然各車站内都有了這種郵電代理處的設置，那末，車站上的旅客遇有急事拍電寄信，就可免去奔波找尋的種種麻煩了。不過這種車站郵電代理處，尙在初創時期，現已由交鐡兩部當局决定，先擬在京滬滬杭甬兩路之上海北站，上海南站，南京下關，杭州城站，蘇州，無錫，鎭江，嘉興等八站，先行試辦，辦理有了相當成績，然後擴充到全國各路的各站。</p>
<p>年來交通當局抱有一種極遠大的宏願，一方面本着國營事業商業化的原則，勵精圖治，銳意革新，種種設施和改革，莫不以便利民衆爲前提，以圖事業之普遍發展，一方面以通力合作的精神，先謀本身所轄郵電航空的密切聯絡，然後更進一步與其他國營事業互相聯絡，以期使整個交通事業打成一片，增加消息靈通的效率。所以在交鐡兩部通力合作之下創設這種車站郵電代理處，其意義非但僅僅便利民衆而已，就是將來對於傳遞消息鞏固國防方面，也有極大的關係。我希望雙方人員，努力推行，務使這種車站郵電代理處，於最短期間，普遍於全國各站。</p>
<p>我們再看看東隣日本，他們的火車站與郵便局之間都有極密切的通信聯絡，並且在他們的電信法規中，明白的規定：在每一個火車站中，必須另闢一室，以供火車站與郵便局聯絡通信之用。可見這種通信聯絡的工作，意義非常重大。當此國勢頻危，外患日迫之秋，我們對於這種重要的聯絡工作，應該本汪院長指示我們的「通力合作」精神，努力促其成功。</p>

<p>近代各國廣撞事業的急速進步，使高效率的遙控電話纜，日增其設計上及製造上的需要。此種電話纜的設計，旣須適合播音的語言，使其發音準確，又須在播送各種音樂時，得清晰純正的成績，不致發生减低或變音的弊病。無綫電工程師遭遇此種問題時，欲求解决的方法，可以利用電話局原有的長途電話纜，作成遙控綫網，將某一播送台，和各不同地點的其他播送台相接連，使各台的音樂節目，相互播送；或埋設專用遙控電話纜，直接將音樂室和播送台相連接，俾廣播音樂室内所發的節目。</p>
<p>遙控電話纜的心綫，在選擇或設計時，有重要的性質兩項，須加注意：（一）心綫須能傳送音樂中的每一音符，使有極準確的聲調丨換言之，須有十足的闊大周率節Ｗido　Frequency　Range足與樂器上的聲浪周波率相符合，即最高的音符，亦可準確傳送；（二）心綫傳送各項周率，須絕對不受衰退影響，即各種傳送的周率，在無論使用何一波幅時，應毫無變態。再有進者，此項心綫，更不可因鄰近他種綫路，或强力綫的感應，發生影響；因感應所得的結果，無論其發生，關係由電話的通話，或電報的信號，或電力的强電流所致，均足使播送的音樂節目，成不清晰或不平正的的現象。</p>
<p>遙控綫路，應用架空綫條，亦可得到闊大的周率帶，而不致發現衰退現象，因爲架空綫條，本有其特性，可以傳送高度的周波率，而無衰退弊病。但是，事實告訴我們，遙控綫應用架空綫條時，其所受外界的感應，實太顯着，如大氣中的雷電，或附近電力綫路的强電流，到處可使此種不包裹的遙控綫條，受絕大的損害。由此之故，廣播電台所用的遙控綫，必須電纜，因其心綫有金屬物的包裹Metallic　Shiedl，得隔絕外界的感應，然而，普通長途電話上所用的電纜，其避免傳話的衰退弊病時，須偕重負荷綫圈Loadlng　Coil的，仍不能用作廣播台的遙控綫，因其周率帶比較的太小，尚無能力，去傳送播音的聲浪，蓋在普通兩綫回路的長途電話纜中，所有金屬回路内的周率，不過每秒二千七百秒周P.P.S;or　Period　Per　Second，而幻象回路内的周率，比較稍高，亦不過每秒三千五百秒周。近代電話纜，因通話效率，需要較高的周率，曾幾經改良，所有周率已進步至金屬回路每秒三千四百秒周，幻象回路每秒四千三百周，然而如此程度，欲用以作遙控綫，去傳送音樂節目，相差仍遠。最新式的電話纜，用作遙控綫，傳送鋼琴，及提琴的音符，其周率，應每秒有一萬周，而回路内，更須配置適當的負荷綫圈，成績方可美滿。</p>
<h3 id="c230">論電報價目 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>電報價目之高下，爲一國交通史上絕大之問題。其價過高，爲一般民衆經濟能力所不能担負，致利有者絕少，殊違國營事業之宗旨。其價過低，爲事業本身工作價值所不能接受，馴至無法維持，亦非商業政策之原則。如何使之高低適宜，取舍得當？一方面當調查國民經濟能力，又一方面根據事業本身價值，其斟酌損益之間，大有討論研究之餘地。歐美各國，對於電報價目問題，非常重視，常有報價委員會之組織，從事探討，而國際報價之擬定，尤爲國際電信會議討論之焦點。良以電信事業，關係一國之經濟政治文化各方面者甚大，報價一節，自有審愼周詳之必要也。</p>
<p>我國電報價目，論者往往以較各國爲高相詬病。然根據調查統計，（參看本刋第十八期各國與我國電報價目之比較）以每字論，德，比，美等國，均較我國華文電報價目爲高。以每電最低價而論，除日本外，幾無不較我爲高者。若以面積與價目比例言之，則我國面積最廣而收費最廉。是以我國報價過高之說，非篤論也。</p>
<p>論者又謂現行國内報價，非一般民衆經濟能力所能担負，此說頗爲近理，然根據國内報價沿革，又非精確之論。兹調查歷年國内電報價目列表如左：</p>
<p>歷年國内電報價目比較表</p>

<p>試觀右表所列，自光緒二十年八月起至至宣統三年止，均採隔省遞加制，最高至每字四角。自民國元年起民國十七年十月九日止，均採本省隔省制，最高至本省八分，隔省一角六分。自十七年十月十日起，始採用統一制，無分本省隔省，一律以一角計費。此項報價，已較歷年報價爲廉。乃自二十二年一月起，國内華文電報之收報人姓名住址在十五字以内者一律作五字計算，同時加急電報减爲二倍收費，此項辦法實行後，較之歷年任何時代報價爲最廉，而現今材料費用之標準，機件購製之價值，員工薪貲之所需，且不抵於歷年任何時代。五十餘年來之民衆，能担負歷年較高之報價，已經事實證明，是以根據歷年報價言之，現今報價過高之說，又非事實之談也。</p>
<p>據交通部統計，自十七年統一報價實行後，每年營業損失，約百一十餘萬元，自今年改訂收報人姓名住址計費辦法後，每年約損失四十八萬餘元。在此種巨量犧牲之下，與電政經濟極端困難之中，故上月電政會議時，有人鑒於近年郵政鐡路之一再加價，曾主張電報價目恢復本省隔省制，以資救濟者。但經大會决議，以報價問題，應從整理業務與便利民衆着手，仍維持現行價目。探其意旨，苟電政支出上有節縮之可能，與電信業務上有擴充之希望，當儘量爲之，不願變更現行電報價目，而增加民衆負担。此種勵精圖治便利民衆之精神，實難能可貴矣！</p>
<h3 id="c231">天津永立永增合兩銀號私設電台案述評 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 地佑</p>
<p>（破案經過）　交部當局初據密報，天津永立永增合兩銀號在該地英租界耀華里五十一號樓上，私設電臺一所，與上海通報。當卽密飭天津電報局。無綫電臺，及電話局之附屬機關，嚴密恊同偵查。偵查結果，認爲該兩銀號之私設電臺處所，確係在上述地點。遂即會同省會公安局照會英工部局簽准搜查票，前往搜查。初進其内，除有電話兩架外，毫無所見。經詳細搜索，始於梳妝檯内搜出收報機，充電器，密碼本，電報底及其他零件多種。並將報務員一人及該兩銀號夥友各一人當塲拘捕。又詳查其全室電門綫路，係通入天花板内，當將天花板用鋸鋸開，又發現發報機一架，變壓器二波長表及雷鍵各一具。即由英工部局將所有贓物人犯一併引渡公安局送交法院審辦。</p>
<p>（事後處置）　事後交通部以此次破獲該兩銀號私設電臺，各方恊助甚力，爲酬獎有功，並爲嗣後辦事便利起見，特給報話兩局局長，電臺總工程師，公安局局長，英工部局警務處處長等一等獎章各一枚；局臺兩方之出力報務人員均分别給予獎金；並另撥鉅欵交由津公安局及警務處代爲發給警士。現該案刑事部份已由津地方法院檢察處以盜竊罪正式起訴，其侵害電報營業部份，已由電報局詳細計算清楚，附帶私訴。至此案要犯永立永增合兩銀號經理，案發後卽畏罪潛逃無踪，業經通令嚴緝，務獲歸案究辦。再該兩銀號與私設電臺間傳遞電報，係利用市内電話裝置，故已飭令津話局將該兩銀號所裝電話全部撤除，以爲利用國營電話非法通信者戒。又交部當局以津地年來時有私設電臺發現，影響電政前途至鉅，爲澈底肅清起見，特在津埠各大報刋登廣告，懸賞舉發私臺云。</p>
<p>（結論）　查電信條例第三條載：「左列電信（略）經國民政府行政院交通部或其他委託機關之核准，得由地方政府公私團體或個人設置」。故未經主管機關之核准，私自設立電臺，實爲電信條例所不許。再查此案牽連人犯有八人之多，而其私臺並有竊聽各處新聞電報並兜攬商報牟利情事。揆其情節，實較其他私設電信案件不同。查無綫電之傳遞，均賴電波，故私設電臺者私自通信之外，能聽取公家電臺之電波及電臺發出之電報。衡諸刑法第三四零條第二項所示電氣應以物論，其應構成刑法上結夥竊盜之罪，自屬毫無疑義。故天津檢察處以盜竊罪提起公訴，洵爲嚴明公正之舉。抑有進者：年來私設電臺秘密通信之風甚熾，弊害所逮，大則影響地方治安，小則擾亂市面金融，而妨害國營電信事業，關係尤爲重大。惟查此項私設電臺雖經交部一再破獲法辦，乃奸人重利輕法，仍有甘於嘗試，頑不知警者。考其所以致此之由，一因無綫電人才機器材料易於招致，二因懲處法規欠嚴不足以儆奸頑。故治本之道，應一面由交部設法將無綫電人才材料機器統制管理，使私設電臺者失其憑藉；一面由交部呈請行政院咨立法院請於改訂刑法草案内，增加專條，對於私設電臺非法通信及其使用者，　從嚴科罪，所謂「治亂國，用重刑。」者，殆卽類是，宵小或知所歛跡歟。聞交通部方面，對於後者加重刑罰一層，已擬議及之，爲維護方在造端之我國無綫電信事業計，有及早實現之必要也！</p>

<p>— 國松</p>
<p>丨丨公用電話問題解决之結果丨丨</p>
<p>本刋第十九期履冰先生提出公用電話問題，供衆討論，并推論公用電話在我國未能推行之原因，由於（甲）使用問題與（乙）裝置問題未得適當辦法，故應於便利民衆之中，必須兼顧業務之意，立論允當。查我國之公用電話裝設在各繁要城市者，或由交通部電話局自營，或招商經理，均已先後舉辦。惟因向無準則，各地所訂營業章程，及招商經理辦法，至不一致，且多欠妥之處。殊不足以引起民衆發電之興趣？公用電話之未臻發達，實爲主因。兹由交通部訂定「交通部電話局公用電話營業通則」及「交通部電話爲招商經理公用電話通則」各一種，已於本年九月二十二日公布施行。前者係解决使用問題，後者係解决裝置問題，有此一定通則，以資遵守後，公用電話問題，至是解决矣。</p>
<p>查公用電話之設置，較之私人電話甚爲重要。何則？私人電話不過供個人或一商店或一機關之通話，範圍甚小；公用電話，供全市民衆之通話，需要尤鉅。且在我國電話事業尙未發達之時，尤須推廣業務，使民衆樂於利用，養成通話習慣，然後事業始有發達之可言。</p>
<p>交通部公布兩種通則之目的，全爲便利民衆着想，雖其初次推行，誠爲履氷先生所述（甲）使用問題與（乙）裝置問題所受之響影，對於營業上不無損失，然揆之國營事業民衆化商業化之宗旨，决不因暫時些微之損失，而置公用電話於不顧。况公用電話，一經發達，民衆咸覺發電便利與需要，轉而可以促進私人電話之普遍乎？</p>
<p>吾人當躑躅街衢時，偶有要事，欲通知其某人或某機關，常苦無由通達，或到各商行借用電話，多被拒絕使用，（其實理應如此）致有進退維谷告訴無門之感。今公用電話通則旣經公布，行見市廛繁盛之區，均有公用電話之設置。每次僅須繳通話費銀元自三分至五分，即可享受通話之便利。孫中山先生之農民政策，謂「耕者有其田」，交通部公用電話問題解决後，非「話者有其電」乎？</p>
<h3 id="c233">拍發電報的幾個小門檻（續） <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 清華</p>
<p>前兩期關於省錢的門檻已經說了十二種，現在再來說說關於怎樣可以使電報迅速和準確的門檻：</p>
<p>（一）加急電報　加急電報好比醫院裏門診的特别掛號，電局對於此類電報，收到時立即拍發，比較尋常電報快得多，雖然報費要加倍收取，但有緊要萬分的事，只要電報到的快，也不在乎區區一二元錢。所以商家對於行市的電報，大都拍發加急電報，以便瞬息可到，做種種重要的交易。普通私人如有最緊急的要事，也不妨拍發加急電報，使收電人立刻可以收到。</p>
<p>（二）利用電話傳送電報　拍發電報最耗時費事的，要算發電人必須將所發電報差人或親自送到電局，在這一送之間，最少須耗費五分鐘，多則數十分鐘的時間。電局收到電報後，由甲局傳至乙局，或再傳至丙局，所費時間反屬甚短，但乙局或丙局收到後派差投送時，又須耗費不少時間，所以收發報人若欲使電報迅速，省去派差遞送的時間，那末最好利用市内電話與電局在電話上傳送電報，最爲便利。發電時祗將電文用電話傳知電局，電局立即拍發。收電時，由電局將電文傳知收電人。如此兩方面都省去派差遞送的手續與時間，每電至少可快一二十分鐘以至一二點鐘。這是多麽重要的門檻啊！</p>
<p>（三）裝設專綫報話機　在電報往來極多的商家，往往用市内電話傳送電報，因電局或自己的電話適在通話被佔，不免仍有躭擱，所以交通部又想出了一個好辦法，就是准許商户向電局請裝專設電綫並租用電報機，或向當地電話局租用電話專綫及電話機，以便與電局用專綫傳送電報，絲毫不受稽延，詳細辦法可向電局或本社索閱。</p>
<p>（四）跟送電報　發電人如對於收電人的所在地不能確定，如因公至各處巡查，或遊歷各處，發電時難以斷定他究在何處，則可書寫兩處，或兩處以上的地名住址，電局先發至第一地名如探悉收報人已離開該地，再發至第二地名，如已離去，再發至第三地名，如此挨次跟送直至送到爲止，這是一個很便利的辦法。至於報費發電人可先付至第一段的報費，其餘各段報費向收電人收取，如發電人願全部繳付者亦可。此種跟送電報發電人如欲知何時送妥者，可使用「送妥電知」辦法，在電首加註「電知」字樣（作一字計費），並加付六字尋常電報費，電局卽於送妥該電時，發電通知發電人，該電業於某日某時送妥，發電人收到此電，卽知電報業已送到，可以放心了！，這個發電的門檻，恐怕懂的人很少，希望讀者轉告親友，那末遇到這種情形時，就可從容拍發跟送電報，不必先發一電至甲處，等到電局通知送不到，再發一電至一處，旣免躭擱許多的時間，又可省却許多的麻煩，確是一個極便利的發電辦法！</p>
<p>（五）轉遞電報　收電人有時因有要事他往，但預知某處將有來電，爲避免來電稽延起見，可親赴或函知電局，遇有致彼之電報，在電局收到時，立即轉遞至所往地方之電局，送交收電人，其報費由收電人預付，或收電時繳付均可。還有收電人臨走並未與電局接洽者，其家屬或親友亦可請求將該電轉至某處，惟報費須由請求而繳付。這個辦法似乎與另發一電差不多，但收電人預先知照電局，來電就可不必交差投送，直接轉遞某處，速率上快的多了！再如託家屬或親友將某處來電重發一次，那末至少電文内須多加「某處來電」等字樣，又須多耗報費了！</p>
<p>（六）電碼自譯　電碼自譯我在說省錢的門檻時，已經說過，但自己翻譯電碼還有一種好處，就是電局接到此電時，可以不必躭擱立卽拍發，如交電局代譯，因爲代譯的電報不止一二張，繁忙的電局，往往同時有數張以致數十張，那末電局縱派三四個人代譯，總不免稍有稽延，比較自譯的電報，當然要慢些。所以電碼自譯，也是使電報快的小門檻啊！</p>
<p>以上說了六種門檻，都是關於怎樣使電報快的辦法，現在再來說說關於怎樣使電報準確的門檻；</p>
<p>（一）書寫清楚　發電報的人往往因事體緊要，書寫電文不免潦草，電局人員收到時，難免誤看而拍發錯誤，致使收電人不明電文意義而發生誤會，以爲是電局疏忽拍錯。洋文電報内Ａ與○，Ｅ與Ｌ，Ｂ與Ｆ，Ｑ與Ｇ等極爲近似，如書寫模糊，卽易誤看拍錯。還有用打字機抄打的電報，有時打字員貪懶，將打錯的字母並不擦去，祗在該字母的上面加打一字母，於是會變成又像Ａ又像○的字母，使電局人員無法辨認，這是發電人自己的不好，就是錯了，也只好自負其責了！所以電文書寫清楚，就是使電報準確的一個小門檻。再發電人的姓名住址必須在報底下端詳細書明，萬一電報發生錯誤或無法投送時，電局可以詢問或通知發電人，否則就無法通知，躭誤他的電報了。</p>
<p>（二）校對電報　電報内如有銀錢數目字或緊要字句，關係重要，不可錯誤，那末發電人爲求準確可靠起見，可請求電局將電報於傳遞時校對一遍，此項電報稱爲校對電報，在電報首端應書一「校」字，並加付校對費，照尋常電報費二分之一計算。電文就可擔保無誤，如不幸再發生錯誤，電局可將報費全部退還，但這是極少遇到的。這種辦法發電人雖須加半付費，但電文可絕對擔保準確，不致躭誤要事，也是值得的啊！</p>
<p>（三）自譯電碼照書原文　上面已經說過發電人自譯電碼，旣可省錢，又可快捷。但是萬一忽忙中譯碼錯誤，亦在所不免，所以最好把原來電文仍舊寫在報底上，以便電局人員收受時，把電碼與原文查閱一遍，如有錯誤，卽代爲改正。這也算是使電報準確的小門檻哩！</p>
<p>我在上面說了這許多發電報的門檻，但是還不免掛一漏萬，最好請讀者向本社函索一本「電報省費新章摘要」和别種電報章程（名稱見右上角廣告），細細閱看一下，那就懂得各種的門檻，毫無遺漏了！</p>

<p>— 社友</p>
<p>改良華文來報譯送辦法　交部前爲便利民衆起見，曾訂定免費代譯來報辦法，實行以來，民衆稱便。惟來報上抄寫電碼與代譯之文字夾雜，收報人閱看時頗不便利，且覺不甚整潔，故交部數月前特購置華文打字機一部，發交南京電報局試辦，所有華文明碼來報只打文字不抄電碼，每行可打十餘字，收報人閱看甚爲便利，且因字跡清楚影像特佳。交部兹爲推行起見，特通令各屬臺凡由韋斯登機收下之華文明碼來報，一律譯抄文字，不抄電碼，各大局臺並將照南京局例購華文打字機應用云。</p>
<p>英文新聞電計字辦法　英文新聞電内常有縮字及不規則之凑合字，各電局因照章須作二字或三字計算，往往引起發報人誤會。兹經交部訂定計字辦法，凡非普通習見之縮冩字及英文字字典内未載之凑合字，均應照原來全寫時應計之字數收費，並刋印小册舉例甚詳，以便各新聞記者索閱而免引起誤會云。（此項小册向本社亦可函索）</p>

<p>集慈幼領袖，兒童敎育，衛生，心理各專家於一堂而開的慈幼領袖會議，業已「共同探討」，功德圓滿，宣告閉會了。聞决議所得，有以下各案：（一）呈請政府保障慈幼事業並扶助其發展，（二）呈請政府通緝對於販賣婦孺，及重申畜奴養婢禁令嚴厲執行，（三）呈請飭令禁止未成年兒童拉車及（四）呈請政府從速製定兒童法等。</p>
<p>中國的兒童，業已隨整個民族的沉淪，而陷入可悲可憫的慘境。許多幼失怙恃的貧苦嬰孩，流於乞丐竊盜死亡不說，曁無數不孤不哀的孤童，也因「隨生以來」的窮，同樣走入上述的命運，嚮身爲奴爲婢，作慘苦的工作以謀生，以及賣兒賣女等的罪孽，都在這一根本原因下，千千萬萬的發生；特别在年來災患中，貧苦農民先殺子後自戕，易子而食，將幼女領入都市作「雛妓」，在在都說明中國兒童問題的癥結。</p>
<p>現在如許保赤爲懷的慈幼領袖，竟齊集海上謀以救之，一片「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的心理，實在令人極表欽佩，但願他們「修在兒女身上」。惟有進者，兒童之被販賣，作拉車等慘苦工作，固屬使人「怵惕惻隠」，但是他們到無以謀生之時，只有出賣肉體，作牛作馬，以維生命，欲求一紙禁令以滅絶之，何異令其坐而待斃？製定兒童法，組織育嬰堂孤兒院保赤院兒童敎育社幸福會健樂團等，惻隠固惻隠矣，慈悲固慈悲矣，顧吾人尤望於消滅陷兒童於慘苦命運的社會根源，再加以努力。否則不推其本而齊其末，我未見其有濟。</p>
<p>在此「兒童年」將要來臨之時，我們願以此奉勸慈幼領袖，同時也望人們對兒童問題在此梅毒上頂的社會中，更暴露其潰爛程度的事實，獲得警惕！</p>

<p>換上法蘭絨洋服的時候，我們被朋友邀到烟雨樓的嘉興。一同去的是四個人，都是生活在都市圈中的，這次短短的旅行滿覺得異樣的興奮，像赴一個嚴重的宴會似的籌備了幾天，對於旅行一層也費了相當的躊躇。</p>
<p>高的天，晨風吹拂着我們的彩色領帶，二小時的長程到達了嘉興。朋友已在月台上招呼我們，同來的是他的妹妹。在到他家的路上，一行六個人充滿着異樣的喜悅。</p>
<p>更變了環境，在異鄕人的目光中，一木一草都是奇卉異草，整個下午没有停過步，眞想能在這新的環境中追尋意外的滿足。但是没有到烟雨樓，我們把這名勝地留着明天玩賞。太陽没有歙跡，吃過了晚膳，坐在他家後河邊，爭論着我們不要虚度這個可愛的秋夜。朋友的妹妹提議僱一只小舟遊河，正在這時候，河面上送來清脆的賣菱聲，我們知道嘉興的南湖菱是那樣聞名的，幾個人爭着奔下石級。賣菱的是個女孩子，獨自搖着櫓，滿逗人的，我們買了一面盆菱，就坐在石級上剥起來。或者我們異鄕口音引起了那女孩子的興趣，她忘了她的職業，雖一聲聲喊着賣菱，却没有搖她的櫓。朋友的妹妹玩笑着向她租船，意外地答應了，她更爲我們另外去租了一只小船，六個人蜂一般的湧了上去。</p>
<p>這就是笑話的開始了，我，朋友的妹妹，和同來的琪跳上租來的船。除了琪能够划幾櫓，兩個人是不能做水手的，所以我們的船老是遠離在他們的後面，賣菱的女孩子訕笑我們「要吃菱，快點追上來。」後來在一頂底下我們追上了，朋友却把琪拉了過去，他們的船箭一般的飛了，遠遠的送來一陣陣的笑聲。</p>
<p>我無奈地把起櫓來，努力搖着，還是在櫓底下打轉，於是兩個人合作搖櫓，滲了遍體的汗，船没有前進幾尺路，而前面的船已不見影踪了。這時候迎面來了一條船，他們說現在是落潮的時候，逆流不容易搖櫓的。我們兩個没有辦法，丢了櫓隨牠慢慢退回去，在月光下我們閑談起來。　　現在我記不起我們談些什麽話了，船退回到她家河邊，在石級上坐了許多時候，他們的船才歸來。</p>
<p>第二天夜車回上海，他們兄妹倆殷殷地送到車站，問我們什麽時候再到嘉興多玩幾天，琪回答：「明年菱上市的時候，那個女孩子約着我呢。」這樣笑着分别了。</p>

<h3 id="c237">感情捐 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>讀第五十期論語，於「半月要聞」中得如下一則：</p>
<p>四川近在錢糧上附加捐稅，名曰「感情捐」。據云加此附捐，乃爲駐軍給養之用，如此則軍民感情融洽，不致有向民間勒索之弊。</p>
<p>小子讀之，不禁失聲苦笑，達半小</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>時之久，還連連呼了「猗歟盛哉」上十遍。心頭還不十分舒暢，跟着指頭更發起癢起，於是攤開了稿紙，捉着那「感情捐」三字來略略發揮一下。</p>
<p>不待說，這不但是四川稅政的嶄新發明，更是稅政進步的極致，我想這種辦法，一定旣不是「古已有之」，也不是「外國傳來的」，而是當地當局的新猷。我們很知道，四川之爲四川，是頗爲古怪的，就拿錢糧的征收來說吧，據屢次的報紙所載，有征至五十幾年者，有征至六十幾年者，甚至有征到八十年後者，那麽，我想一般的統計，也總都是預征在四十年以上，不會有一輩傻子祗觀光别人長進，而自己「故步」只預征過數年或數十年者。</p>
<p>年來也常常看見報紙所載，四川的政治，已經比較的進步，却不料其進步的表徵，而是「感情捐」的巧名的樹立。</p>
<p>這不能不算是當地當局的聰明，也或者爲的是錢糧的附加捐稅，正多到無可再多，名目一概想盡了，苦絞腦汁，不知是勞那一位的清神，想去這麽一種辦法丨空前絕後中外無偶的辦法來。</p>
<p>不過「感情捐」三字，終究有些刺目傷心！倘果如論語所載：「如此則軍民感情融洽，不致有向民間勒索之弊」。是則小子也代爲川民伸慶。</p>
<h3 id="c238">檸檬牛奶與女人 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 辛</p>
<p>一對青年男女幽閒輕逸的走着。不時行經水菓店子，女的常會說：買隻檸檬回去吧！或者走到百貨店門首，停步說聲：買罐牛奶吧！男的總有意無意間凑上：那就多買兩隻，你歡喜吃這東西嗎？女的笑笑不嘗回答。終於老是只買一隻和一小罐而已，男的會不耐煩的急加了：幹嗎買這樣小的一罐呢？吃不到兩天的。就多買兩罐大的吧！牛奶和檸檬都是很好的東西，多吃不要緊。但女的終照自己的主意買了，不聽男的好意的話。男的眞有些摸不着頭腦，幹嗎老這樣只買一小罐和一雙呢？</p>
<p>逢到早晨一道起身的時候，男的倒不大嘗注意到女的梳洗之類；但女的大清早就尋小刀子要開牛奶，男的以爲那是她餓了，趕快開了，準備倒出來冲，還要燒點咖啡和上去呢。女的却搶開了去，拿着牛奶和毛巾牙刷等物，走進洗臉房去了。逢到切開檸檬，男的想替她冲冲，却也同樣不用代勞。這才奇怪哩！女人家的脾气怪灣曲啦！難以捉摸。拿進洗臉房間去，一個人吃個痛快嗎？那是未承吧。老愛來這麽一套，那這就令他要看看到底是什麽原因了。女子家怪好玩哩，偷進洗臉房去看看吧。</p>
<p>水和毛巾都弄妥當了，伸出纖而嫩的薑芽似的手，把牛奶倒點兒在手心内，混了些水滴，兩手擦了一擦，就往臉上揩，活像揩雪花膏一樣。男的突然笑了：做什麽這樣呀？回過頭來，嬌羞的回笑：傻瓜不懂…不要管，去吧！男的還没有醒悟：到底是什麽意思，給我說明白吧！嘻嘻嘻，女的笑個不休，一面輕細的揩着臉：阿木林，去吧，等等說…男的滿肚子好奇心，等在旁邊注神的看。</p>
<p>女的全洗好了，收拾了約莫大半個點頭，男的老逗着問，因爲脚站得酸了呢。滿面笑容，拉着男的走進臥室，那個好像剛摘下來的新鮮蘋果兒似的臉，温柔的貼上男的頰和臉的上面去，輕輕用臉皮磨擦男的臉皮：怎麽樣？細膩多吧，柔滑些嗎？男的就像發明了一件奇物，驚異的笑了：是細膩柔滑多啦！原來女人常用牛奶和檸檬汁揩揩臉，把，當做美容之一的裝飾品。洗了這東西，確實「細膩柔滑多啦！」一點不錯，檸檬牛奶和女人，這年頭，有味兒的事情多呢！</p>

<p>— 奕</p>
<p>二年前的秋天，那時阿德還是一個年壯力强的青年人，他和着他的同志，第一次被調到了這繁盛的大都市來，那時他心裏是多未的高興呀！他當了幾年的丘八，年年的只是在和着自己的兄弟們拼命撕殺，終於的得着了這個機會來到這和平地，快樂地，安寗的都市休息了。這在他，幾年來是做夢也没有想到有這末一天。可是不到幾個月，發生出意外的事件，打破了他的迷夢，擺現在他的眼前的已不是那末和平，快樂，安寗的都市，而是砲火連天的大戰塲了。終日飛在他的頭上的，只是那可怕的砲彈和飛機。</p>
<p>太陽的紅旗，插遍了阿德他們以前的陣地，經過了幾個月的拚命，阿德雖萬幸没有戰死，但他已經是變成一個殘廢者，從這個時候起，在這都市裏，就終日的有着他這流浪人的足跡。</p>
<p>飢餓和寒冷，一日一日加甚的壓到阿德的身上，就連那一碗粗米的丘八飯和那單薄的棉衣也得不到了。所以，每每當他受了太過的飢寒的摧殘的時候，他會發狂得如狗一般底呌着：</p>
<p>「我不是人嗎？我是活該挨餓挨凍的嗎？」</p>
<p>一個秋天過了又是一個秋天，阿德他終日流浪在這都市裏的街頭，終夜在北四川路的舖廊下躺着，在下雨的時候，他連躺下都不可能底整夜在路上走着。</p>
<p>天，對窮人終於發下了很大的慈悲，在幾天前就停了雨，終日的晒着好亮的太陽了。當然，這在阿德是好似找到了一條生路，但在夜裏，他還是一樣的咀咒着天的。</p>
<p>今天，清道夫在掃馬路的時候，阿德就從那小衖裏走到馬路上了，因爲今天是紀念日，路上的行人一定多點，這在阿德是可以多要一點錢去吃一頓飽了。他知道自己是中國人，在這個紀念日，也應該快活一下的。</p>
<p>太陽在今天顯得格外的熱，馬路上擁擠的行人，都已個個在淌着汗水子。誰也都懶得去摸出那口袋裏的銅子，來給這些不知趣的呌化子。從上午一直的到了下午，阿德没有乞到一個銅子。</p>
<p>就在這個紀念日的傍晚，這個殘廢了，而流浪在這都市裏已有二年之久的阿德，他第二十三次的進了牢獄。</p>
<h3 id="c241">病 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>病之於我實在是一種莫大的威脅，無論在任何方面，都足以摧殘我，而使固有的信念起了動搖，多得一次病的磨折之結果，對於人生的思想卽更深一層的塗滿灰色的懷疑。假如是在物力不怎樣缺乏的時候，尙不至有大的變動，若是當在潦倒窮愁連日常三頓飯都没着落而又病倒的話，那不只思想起動搖，簡直完全幻滅了。這時候我將會絕望的向自己喊着：就這樣完了吧，快一點結束悲痛的一生。我的生，就等於黑夜里水面的微波，悠現悠滅，没有月亮，没有星星，更没有絲微的光明可以稍微使我的眼底放亮，興奮一下！而光是充滿無邊的暗雲，無邊的陰霾的濃霧，我還能噙住什麽希望呢，實在再不願這樣横着罪刑的日子活下去。</p>
<p>天天想能早一日停止呼吸，悄悄地回歸到蓋着野草的土堆裏長睡，就是我最大的滿足了。可是用什麽方法達到目的呢！用自己的手割斷自己的脖子本來是頂乾脆的人。只可恨我拿不出這種勇氣來。於是祇有寄托病代替我實現願望。因此當每一次病的降臨，我不特是不會有半點的恐怖，畏懼，而且感到愉快，好像希望已經得到招示，私心喜悅着：我的夙願就將成功了。這樣熱求病情最好一日日的加重下去，加重到再不能加重爲止。</p>
<p>每一次的臥病，希望病會結我毁了生命，可是不，終局是獲得更多更大的苦惱。病了，縱使不吃藥，病勢老不加劇！過了幾天，却又巴巴的恢復過來。它不一下子便給我乾凈了事，然而又成爲了够親暱的伴侣似的，時不時蹩上身來。而每多一回的病，病好之後，身子自然一日不如一日的虧瘦下去，同時思想亦一樣的越加陰暗沉鬱下來，弄到最後，不惟對任何事物完全絕念，人也簡直成了一個有軀壳無靈魂的幽影了。於是我不特詛咒一切，憎恨一切，尤其憎恨。病原本對它是酷愛，不說現在它却用了這種殘酷的手法緩緩地擺佈着我，愚弄着我，像這種取消了希望的枯燥無味的人生呌我如何忍受得了呢？</p>
<h3 id="c242">失眠 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 羅姗</p>
<p>計算起來業已失眠十天了</p>
<p>眼睛望着桌子心的鐘，長針又在六點，短針恰恰指在午夜後的兩時。</p>
<p>念着數字，從一到十，眼皮闔而開開而闔。側着身熟睡了的伙伴，憂鬱地，痛苦地蒼白色的臉，在被窩外呼吸着，那呼吸彷彿一陣陣將死之人的嘆息。</p>
<p>突然，一種死的威脅支配着她的全生命。於是在想到死的一刹那，一切的幸運與致樂全在死的威脅下摧毁了，仰着頭，又一次的端睨着她那青灰色的臉。</p>
<p>「兩個凄慘的人在一堆……」她喃喃地。</p>
<p>「爲什麽還不睡呢？」</p>
<p>又一次的她自己問，心像古鐘似的，在内中鳴響。</p>
<p>差不多近於神經病吧？她自己擔心，於是眼前泛現着白天經過瘋人院門首的感想。</p>
<p>多少厭惡這死一般的生活喲？毫無聲息的，呻吟，藥瓶，凄傷的臉，她自己的神經衰弱病，失眠，不飯，…嫌惡喲！一個寂寞的人帶着寂寞的心靈，住於這寂寞的處所。</p>
<p>（距離生命末日之到來也不遠了，噯！）</p>
<p>她依舊瞧着短針嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>睡不着的原因很簡單，白天的週旋，不安定，晚上當然熟睡不了，除非毫無靈魂的軀殼身。她傷感了！</p>
<p>一個凄傷的心，一個没人了解的悲哀的人，她自己没有一點點慰安可得，還得週旋於大人孩子之間，勉爲强笑，把沈寂之空氣層匀至最熱閙，她藏起眞我，隠着由衷的悲哀，不敢任性地流一會淚或是發一陣悶氣，每天裝着小丑般上臺的老套子需把戲，笑，講故事，歌活躍的爵士樂，各人在愉快中挨着秋季這沈悶的雨天，但她所得到的是什麽？她如此地不安寗。</p>
<p>（自己是頂痛苦，顧全這些，唉！）</p>
<p>輕輕地像夢囈似地，拖着鞋，擰息了燈，她眼睛依舊耀亮於夜之黑暗中。</p>

<h3 id="c246">關乎蕭麗鄧波的一些可愛的零碎 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 景揚</p>
<p>這位可愛的「小娃娃」，蕭麗鄧波，現在正在派拉蒙攝影塲上，拍一張“Now　and　Forever"。有一天，蕭麗剛拍完一段戲，那位導演先生亨利哈德惠突然飛奔而去。人家莫名其妙，以爲他瘋了。不知他是去買冰淇淋給蕭麗吃的，因爲她表演一塲哭，實在太眞切了，使哈德惠不由得情不自禁起來，還有一位同她在一個攝影塲工作的明星，加雷古柏，他本來是位美術家，曾做過報館的插畫家，他用盡了各種方法，呌蕭麗坐定了畫一張畫，後來畫成了，他就送了她一隻絲絨狗熊，呌格龍貝。</p>
<p>許多人以爲蕭麗鄧的成爲明星，（她確是一位明星，薪水是每星期一千二百五十美金。）大概是一件偶然僥倖的事吧。當然，無論她是蕭麗鄧波或是凱塞琳赫本，要是没有幸運帮忙，是不能踏到明星的地位的。但是，要說蕭麗鄧波是一個五齡的小孩子，她做明星完全是幸運造成的，那就是寃枉她了。她是從小就由她的母親指導了，練習種種跳舞藝術，才能到她現在的地位的。並且一個人改到了明星的地位，還要有才藝去維持她的地位，而蕭麗鄧波的地位，確是没有别的小孩子，可以搶得去的了。因此，我們又不得不佩服狐狸公司的眼光遠大，竟和她訂了七年的長期合同。在這七年之内，她每天有六小時的工作，每天拍戲。所以，我們以後可以多看到這位可愛的小娃娃了。</p>
<p>她自己做了明星，但她却不懂明星是什麽。她的父母亦竭力設法使她不知道，所以她一些没有自高自大的觀念。這個時候，她正在攝影塲上，和一位同伴的女孩子玩着。她的媽媽喊她道：「蕭麗，上這兒來。」蕭麗玩得太起勁了，她聽了她母親喊她，祇答應了一聲：「哈囉」，還是玩着。她的母親於是又喊道：蕭麗，上這兒來。」蕭麗於是立即放下了她的玩具，飛奔了過來。不管她是不是明星，她的母親到底是她的「媽嬭」。她的媽嬭呌她來，她不敢不快來。她來了，她呌了一聲：「媽嬭，做什麽？」她的媽吩咐她做什麽，她就去做什麽，從來没有違拗過她的母親的意思。</p>
<p>蕭麗每天晚上，還要背誦明天拍戲的對白。八點鐘起，背熟了就睡覺。她每天早晨七點鐘起身。九點鐘以前到攝影塲。她的臉是紅紅白白的比花瓶還要好看。她亦不用妝扮，就可以上鏡頭，所以化裝的時間是很節省的。她工作了六個鐘頭，回到家裏的時候，已得倦極了。她喜歡拿頭靠在枕頭上，冥想一下。她想的幾個人是一等燈光匠吉萊，明星傑姆斯鄧，三等木匠湯梅，明星加雷古柏和女明星珈珞兒龍巴，攝影師助手，導演哈德惠，珍妮蓋語，以及小朋友梅麗琳等等。在蕭麗的小腦筋之中，是絕對没有階級之分的。在她的眼光看來，明星，電燈匠，木匠，導演等等，都是同等的朋友，都愛她一致無二的待遇。</p>
<p>蕭麗鄧疲的脾氣，是天生晴朗的。她不知世界上有幻滅，悲慘，失望，憂鬱等事。但是她却有一次大哭了一塲。那天是一位女明星桃樂賽黛爾，汽車出事慘死的明天。蕭麗正在拍戲，鏡頭已經預備好了。她忽然聽見導演哈德惠和一個人談起黛爾小姐的慘死。蕭麗和黛爾是曾合拍過：「小明星被綁案」的，因此，她聽見了，不覺悲從中來，就嚎啕大哭起來。旁人怎樣勸她，都勸不過來，於是導演，索興由她哭，吩咐開來拉，就趁她在珈珞兒龍巴懷裏哭的時候，拍了一段段的戲。但是她的天性，是近於高興的一邊的，所以她哭完了，又很高興的將一天</p>
<p>雲翳忘記了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c247">評「連環計」 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Lady　is　Willing</p>
<p>丨國泰丨</p>
<p>美國影片充分的注意於趣味詼諧的發展，到現在幾乎成爲一種所謂「潮流」。我把差不多在每一個影片中都可看到這一方面的發展，不管作品的内容是怎樣决定的需要嚴肅而重厚的處理，而結果每每是多量的打諢將沉重的調子破壞了的。不久以前大光明開映的「藝人秘史」（Whom　the　Cods　Destoy），在後一部分中無疑的是非常重厚的悲劇，可是前半部，劇作者爲了要使其「發噱」「打諢，結果成爲前後兩部各别的存在，在調子上不能統一的東西。當然，前部的趣味化使後部的重厚不知損失多少。同樣，我們看見好些偵探片也輕鬆地趣味化了，這除了「霧夜」之外，我們還可以舉出許多。假使這「連環計」我們也將它歸入於偵探片之類的話，那末又是一部喜劇的偵探片了。</p>
<p>在這一影片中，最大的成就，無疑的祗是對白的詼諧，節奏的輕鬆雋永。爲了趣味化，添加了許多滑稽的角色，爲了調子的輕鬆，插入了許多和内容不相關聯的趣味的插曲。</p>
<p>這中間除了對於貴婦人和企業家，有着若干諷刺之外，而對於三個傻瓜的調笑，將他們描寫成十分庸俗而滑稽的人物，却是無條件的對窮人開玩笑了。甚至於從來出演傷感悲劇的李思廉霍華，也成爲諧趣的帮辦。</p>
<p>是的，就内容來說，這裏的諧趣並没有過份的失去内容與形式的一致性，換句話說，卽是故事中所包含的人物，除了三個傻瓜之外，其餘的人未嘗不值得諷刺一下。然而嚴格的說來，由於偶然性的題材之亂抓，並没有如何充實的内容。而劇作者却將這種題材充其量的誇大起來，絲毫没有削弱資本主義作品的特徵，而成爲形式超越了内容的作品了。</p>
<p>「傀儡」的開映之後，果然有人說「形式不够表現内容」。這除了說明半殖民地的中國電影批評家迷戀於美國影片之旣成形式之外，乃是不足以反證「傀儡」内容與形式之統一性的。再不然，就是他們還不够理解。可是另一方面，我們對於僅僅誇大形式而不求内容充實與完整的美國喜劇，却是應該嚴格指斥的。因此，我們對於「連環計」是没有方法予以較高的評價的，一部庸俗的喜劇而已。</p>

<p>— 章子規</p>
<p>「紅樓春深」是值得一看的一部軟性影片，然而未免太可惜了，它祗迎合了一般少數人的心理，它只供有閑階級的高貴人們當作消遣工具。</p>
<p>然而，「紅樓春深」也有可取的地方，導演確也有些聰明之點，譬如幾個倒垂鏡頭很可取，尤以火把綴成四個「湔雪國恥」的大字，的確是增色了不少。但是也有幾處地方該要提出來和劇作者商榷的。（一）郁青峯旣是個有理智的青年文藝家，而且他已有了理想中的愛人丨丨周碧蓮丨丨何以不能够擺脫一個浪漫女子丨丨羅蘭呢？同時還被她强着而成姦，結婚。（二）噱頭多，被捲入低級趣味的公式化。（三）結婚禮畢，當卽遠足蜜度「新婚之夜」，這也許是劇作者的新創造吧？因爲在習慣上從没有聽說過。</p>
<p>至於演員們倒是很努力的</p>

<p>經過了幾個月的日夜努力，耗費了不少人的心血，這部中國有聲歌舞片的處女作「人間仙子」，終於告成；已於上星期六起，在金城的銀幕上，和滬上影迷相見了。</p>

<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>這是墨西哥第二次革命末葉的一幕慘劇。反動派的領袖派斯瓜將軍，已經被圍在齊華華的山中。班卓維拉的軍隊，曾受過一次挫折，但是派斯瓜却不肯乘勝進攻，以爲憑了他的機關槍隊的威力，一定可以取到最後的勝利，因此算差了一着棋，被班卓生擒了起來。班卓正吮着一隻橘子，走到被綁着的派斯瓜面前。他對湯麥斯道：「湯麥斯，快鬆開他的綁！將軍到底是個將軍。這眞豈有此理！」湯麥斯立即鬆開了派斯瓜的綁。派斯瓜聳着鼻子冷冷地謝了一聲。班卓道：「小意思。算不了什麽。你覺得膽子很大，唉？」派斯瓜道：「不必囌嚕。將我槍斃好了。」班卓笑道：「演說得不差，比我强得多。你知道我是常常想念你的。全世界的人都說班卓維拉是一位英雄丨一個有膽子的人。但是到了派斯將軍的面前，我却不過是個跪在地下，膝行而前的人。我還求着，喊着，哭着，怪不好看的。你記得嗎？」他將吮剩的橘子擲在地下。派斯瓜微微的笑了一笑道：「記得很清楚。」班卓道：「我求你饒恕我所做的一切。一派斯瓜道：「一個人要是怕死的話，他就會做出許多奇怪的事情的。」班卓道：「你說得不錯。我過後曾經多少次問我自己：班卓，你眞的怕死嗎？我自己說：不！我告訴你，或者是因爲這個。那個帶鬍子的小丈夫。愛情往往使一個人怕死。這是哲學，是不是？或者你愛什麽人丨你亦有夫人，小孩子。你不要再和他們見見嗎？」派斯瓜冷笑道：「你想聽我哭喊嗎？不，對不起，使你失望。我不求你。我亦不哭。我預備受槍斃好了。班卓哈哈笑道：「槍斃？誰告訴你槍斃的？你們説槍斃了嗎？」他説着從一個長桌子上，拿起了一罐蜂蜜，對着派斯瓜道：「將軍，這個畫眞不差。和我從一個地方來的。你要吃些嗎？」派斯瓜正低着頭，看見班卓剛才吃剩，擲在地下的橘子，已經叢滿了白螞蟻。他看見了螞蟻，如同看見鬼似的一樣害怕起來，汗珠像黄豆大，一顆一顆從他的額角上爆了出來，流在臉上。班卓慢慢道！「它們喜歡蜂蜜，比橘子還要喜歡。」他説着將兩條粗指，伸進了蜜罐，掏了一大把的蜂蜜，漓漓拉拉的走到派斯瓜的面前。派斯瓜倒退了一步，臉都青了。班卓伸手就將蜜漬的指頭，望他的耳朶裏塞了進去，順手就在派斯瓜的臉上，亂搽一起。派斯瓜狂喊了起來：「不興！不興！不是這個方法！你不可以！班卓！不要那樣！讓我說句話！班卓！」但是班卓對他的部下，向派斯瓜一努嘴，幾個兵馬上就將那猪呌似的將軍帶走了。班卓拿那罐蜜交給湯麥斯道：「這個拿去。多給他些。鼻子哩。耳朶裏。隨便什麽地方。你瞧着辦好了。湯麥斯拿了罐子退了下去。派斯瓜的慘呌，繼續了半天，慢慢地低下去，以至於聽不見了。這是班卓維拉慘無人道的一斑。他過後還下令，呌西班牙血統的人民，無論男女老小，均須於二十四小時内，離開齊華華，否則一概槍斃。這時亂哄哄地，交通已斷絕，火車已没有。少壯的還可以走路逃亡。老幼殘弱，流落在後面的，就不免遭遇慘殺。這就是西班牙民族，統治墨西哥土人時代，種種暴政所招的讐怨的結果，而班卓的以暴易暴，却又自己替自己種了一個惡因了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yin Rugeng and Chaisan Arrive in Malanyu to Inspect the Actual Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Around the 20th, Both Parties Will Officially Hand Over</p>
<p>A Mausoleum Management Committee Will Be Established After the Takeover</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Yin Rugeng's efforts to mediate the Malanyu takeover issue, it is expected that the handover will take place around the 20th of this month. Yin, accompanied by Chaisan, traveled to Malanyu by car this morning, escorted by thirty members of the security team. It is estimated that they will arrive that evening. Starting on the 16th, they will conduct a detailed inspection of the recent situation in the area, as well as the number of Eastern Mausoleum properties mortgaged and the extent of damage. They are expected to return to Beiping on the afternoon of the 17th and report the progress to Huang Fu before officially holding the handover ceremony at a set date. The Eastern Mausoleum Management Committee will be established after the takeover. It is rumored that the committee will be a reorganized version of the original Eastern Mausoleum Management Association. The 20,000 banner people and civilians residing in the Eastern Mausoleums will also be properly resettled. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng, along with Japanese Army Attaché Chaisan, Navy Attaché Watanabe, Zunhua County Chief He Guanyi, Public Security Bureau Chief He Huangxian, and a party of seven in total, departed for Malanyu at 7:00 AM on the 15th in a chartered Yongfeng Company vehicle. Passing through Tongxian at 8:00 AM, they were escorted by more than ten members of the security team dispatched by the Ji-Mi Special Commissioner's Office. Traveling east through Sanhe, they arrived at Jixian at 2:00 PM, where they had lunch at the county government and rested briefly. They continued westward at 3:00 PM and are expected to arrive in Malanyu by 5:30 PM. It is planned that they will inspect the Eastern Mausoleums on the 16th and return to Beiping in about four or five days. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng, accompanied by his secretary He Xiaoyi, and Chaisan departed early this morning at 6:00 AM in two cars to inspect Malanyu, survey the locations for the Japanese army's garrison, and determine the location for the newly established Qing Mausoleums Management Committee's office. Yin Tixin, Director of the Ji-Mi Administrative Special Commissioner's Office in Malanyu, had already gone ahead on the 14th to prepare for the takeover. The people of Malanyu, hearing that we will be taking over, are all delighted. The 110 or so soldiers of the Japanese Army's 7th Division infantry company, led by Yoshimura, arrived in Malanyu on the 14th in twenty cars, carrying a large amount of military supplies. They are stationed in the Japanese barracks. Today, about eighty Japanese soldiers and seventy puppet soldiers left Malanyu one after another and returned to Chengde. It is rumored to be a troop rotation for bandit suppression with no major significance. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Committee members from Ji Province's Civil Affairs Office for the Eastern Mausoleums Management Committee have not yet been appointed. Yin Rugeng's trip to Malanyu will task Yin Tixin, the Director stationed in Yu, and Li Ying, the Xinglong County Chief, with preparing for the establishment. Once the Ji Civil Affairs Office representative is appointed, the establishment will be announced and work will begin. Of the two Qing Imperial Family descendants representatives, one will be selected to be stationed permanently in the Eastern Mausoleums for official duties. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Over the past week, several hundred Japanese and puppet troops have successively arrived in Malanyu and the surrounding areas of the Eastern Mausoleums, carrying a large amount of military supplies. It seems likely that they intend to stay for a long time. It is rumored that even if the Japanese return Malanyu, they will still station troops in the city, citing the lack of housing outside the Great Wall as a reason for delay.

<p>Zhang Ji: Recent Situation in the Northwest</p>
<p>Dai Chuanxian: The Problem of Education in Our Country</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held its 152nd Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Li Ciwen, Xiao Jishan, Ji Liang, Gu Zhenggang, and staff members, totaling more than 500 people, attended. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting. Zhang Ji reported on the "Recent Situation in the Northwest," stating that Shaanxi Province's political and legal systems have made significant progress, and that the Northwest's construction has also achieved considerable results with the assistance of the Ministry of Railways and the Economic Commission. The issue of developing the Northwest is becoming increasingly important, and it is hoped that all central agencies can contribute their own strengths to the Northwest, which will lead to even greater results. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Memorial Week on the morning of the 15th. He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Zhang Yipeng, Lin Xiang, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various ministries and commissions, totaling about 300 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the attendees in paying respects, followed by Dai Chuanxian's report on the problem of education in our country. He stated that the current state of education in our country has attracted widespread attention and has become the most important issue for current study. The focus of this study is not on the current education system, but on the content of education. Since the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, the central government has attached great importance to education, and various key proposals have been decided based on the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, establishing a consistent direction for education in our country. Government laws and regulations have also been formulated in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's proposals. The most important issue in education at present is the Chinese language subject in primary and secondary school curricula, especially at the primary school level, which is considered even more important. The content of Chinese language textbooks for primary and secondary schools published by various bookstores currently uses the vernacular in the primary school section, and the materials often use anthropomorphic depictions of animals. Whether this type of teaching material is suitable for children's psychology should be carefully studied. The speaker is currently engaged in this work and is studying the contents of primary school textbooks in various countries for reference. In the secondary school section, the teaching materials include classical Chinese selections, contemporary essays, vernacular poetry, and translated articles. The contemporary essays select works by Kang Baiqing, Guo Moruo, Hu Shi, and others, while the vernacular materials are taken from books such as "Water Margin" and "Romance of the West Chamber." The compilation of these textbooks is more cautious by the Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company, while the World Book Company is the most mixed and disorganized, only publishing works by contemporary authors who promote each other and can lead primary school students astray. The government's competent authorities should issue a general order to prohibit them. As for the study of the classics, it is indeed a problem that should be studied. The classics are the embryo of all Chinese civilization, and their political philosophy is more substantial than the current general new theories. The reason why our country has been able to maintain thousands of years of history without decline is because this political philosophy still exists. It is hoped that people across the country will pay attention to research in order to promote and carry forward our country's inherent culture. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an instruction to the Executive Yuan on the 13th, stating, "To implement the order, according to the report submitted by the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics of the Government, and the reply from the Central Political Council, previously, the letter from the Secretariat of the Government was forwarded, in accordance with the Government's approval, regarding the general budget of ordinary revenues and expenditures of Shanghai Municipality for the 22nd year of the Republic of China, along with the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics's opinion. After being submitted to the Finance Group for review, it was reported that the originally listed revenues and expenditures were each 11,122,576 yuan, an increase of more than 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous year. The comprehensive analysis of revenues and expenditures shows that the increase is due to the promotion of all municipal administration, especially the post-war reconstruction of the urban area. The increase in expenditures is mostly necessary, and the increase in revenues is also within the capacity of the people. For example, the newly added tax item, land value tax, has a revenue of 1.5 million yuan, which is more than enough to offset the wartime reduction in business tax. It is considered a good tax that can be used most effectively. However, the tax on vehicles and surcharges is only 10,000 yuan, which the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics points out is close to being petty and detailed, and it is proposed to reduce it appropriately in the next year, which is reasonable. The municipal government should consider this at the time. If it applies to all kinds of vehicles, even rickshaws, it should be abolished as soon as possible. As for expenditures, the expenses for party affairs, administration, and public security have each increased by tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics states that it is not appropriate to expand too much during the current national crisis, and it is proposed to reduce 40,000 yuan for party affairs, 30,000 yuan for administration, and 50,000 yuan for public security. The amount reduced should be transferred to the second contingency fund item, which seems feasible. It is proposed to deduct these amounts as listed. In addition, the business net profit originally collected under the revenue item was only 37,000 yuan. Now, according to the business budget, supplementing the results of the revenue and expenditure of the municipal bank, the business net profit should be increased by 64,633 yuan in this case. At the same time, the contingency fund should be increased under the expenditure item to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. A total of 11,128,729 yuan is proposed to be approved for the general revenues and expenditures of the city in the 22nd year." The matter was subsequently submitted to the 425th meeting of the council, and it was resolved to adopt the review opinions and record the case for notification, with the hope that it would be investigated and followed accordingly. With this approval, it should be handled accordingly. In addition to replying to the letter, the original attachments are hereby issued to the Executive Yuan for investigation and handling. This order." In response to this order, the draft budget for the general revenues and expenditures of Shanghai Municipality in the 22nd year of the Republic of China has been compiled. Except for the resolutions of the Central Political Council, which have been recorded in full in the text and will not be attached separately, it is hereby submitted for review and approval and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review and promulgation. Based on this, except that the order and submitted documents are fully understood and awaiting orders for dispatch to the Executive Yuan for investigation and handling, this order is also issued for printing and distribution, together with the attached originals, for investigation and handling by the said Yuan.

From 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the fire was still blazing, and the disaster area spread for three or four li. There were approximately one thousand several hundred disaster-stricken households. The fire took advantage of the wind, and although the entire city's fire brigade did its best, it was still of no avail. Most of the disaster area was commercial, and the losses were alarming. The population of Jiangxi has increased fivefold compared to before, and the population density is too high. In addition, most of the buildings are made of wood, which is prone to fire. There is no tap water in the city, and residents draw water from wells. However, the fire area is too large, so it is impossible to put out the fire. There have been three major fires in the past two months, all of which have affected hundreds of households, but they are far less severe than the fire on the 14th. The disaster victims cried out to the heavens, which was heartbreaking to hear. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The major fire in Nanchang on the 14th had not been completely extinguished by 2:00 AM on the 15th. After inspecting the disaster area, it was seen that the scope of the disaster area was unprecedented, extending to 19 streets and alleys, and was only blocked by the river bank. Starting from Tangcheng, it extended to Huiwai Junzi Alley, Guangwai Liaozhou Street, and the Public Security Fourth Branch was also destroyed. The rest were mostly shops. The cause of the fire was careless cooking in a certain store. The estimated loss is about several million yuan. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Scattered bandit gangs have been discovered in the areas of Yanshan and Jieshan at the junction of Yutian and Zunhua. They are rampaging and looting, and are extremely rampant. The public security bureaus of Yutian and Zunhua counties have dispatched police and local militias to pursue them in all directions. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 14th, 80 bandits suddenly invaded the Xiyang Wu Guantun village in Shaluliu River Town, Fengrun County. All of the bandits were wearing tattered old military uniforms and carrying new weapons. A man named Bei Han was the leader, claiming to be under the order of a certain commander to occupy Shaluliu River Town. The town's public security bureau reported the incident and has secretly gathered hundreds of local militiamen to prepare for resistance. County Chief Zhang Renli has requisitioned 150 militiamen from Qian'an County to assist in defense. There was still no movement on the night of the 14th. The bandits are entrenched in the village and seem unwilling to leave. Bandits who fled from Yutian to the territory of the puppet Rehe state are still active and want to sneak back into Zunhua. County Chief Shen Zhongyue reported to the province and ordered the local militia to set up defenses at all key intersections to prepare for contingencies. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River defenses in this province are solid. The river has been safely contained this year. All flood prevention committee members are scheduled to return to Jinan on the 18th. Section Chief Pan Yifen has specially gone to the estuary to inspect. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At the beginning of last month, the Yellow River's entrance to the sea changed from the old channel and flowed southeast, entering the sea north of Yangjiaogou. At the beginning of this month, it flowed northeast from Zuojiazhuang, entering the sea near the Tanyagou of Duya Hill. The previous two old channel areas have been silted up, and the new channel is too shallow, preventing smooth drainage. This has caused the water to continue to rise in the upper and middle reaches. With only nine days left until the period of frost and tranquility, the water level at Luokou is still 30.15 meters, which is unprecedented. The River Bureau has sent Section Chief Zhao Aiyu to Tianjin to attend the Yellow River Commission meeting to decide on suggestions to quickly implement the three cases proposed at the last meeting: reorganize the estuary, raise the height of the embankments, and convert the privately built dikes to official management.

<p>(Tianjin) At 6 AM on the 12th, over 150 bandits fully armed with firearms, including several who spoke in a certain foreign language, broke into the Xinglong Daodaoshui Gold Mine and engaged in a fierce battle with the puppet government's mining police. Five bandits were killed and three mining police were killed. Eventually, due to being outnumbered, the bandits broke in, searched for cash, and had breakfast in the mine. The mine originally had 12 Japanese soldiers stationed there, who immediately telegraphed the Japanese and puppet troops in Malanyu. They arrived at noon and jointly repelled the bandits. The bandits entrenched themselves 13 li north of Daodaoshui and have not left. The mine remains under alert. The mine owner, Zhao Guanbei, was kidnapped by the bandits, and his life or death is uncertain. The total loss to the mine is no less than tens of thousands of gold. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Tragic Fire on Avenue Edward VII <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>Shanghai is densely populated, with houses clustered together. In the event of a fire, it easily becomes a disaster. The sacrifice of lives and the loss of property are both substantial. In recent years, the municipal authorities in various districts have recognized this and have strived to improve fire prevention facilities. Taking the First Special District (International Settlement) as an example, the percentage of disaster losses in the district over the past twenty years has decreased from 40% in 1908 to 0.99% in 1933. The difference between the two is vast, which cannot be said to be insignificant progress. However, incidents such as the carelessness at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory on Tangshan Road on February 21st last year, which killed 81 people and injured 50, and the fire at the Ni Shunxing cotton shop on Avenue Edward VII yesterday morning, which killed 14 people and injured over 20, are still horrifying tragedies. This is a very serious social problem today and is closely related to the interests of all citizens.</p>
<p>Analyzing the causes of fires over the years, focusing on the special environment of Shanghai, we can identify the following three points.</p>
<p>(1) Overcrowding in Ordinary Residences: Housing in Shanghai is expensive, and those with middle-class incomes or lower often lament, "It is difficult to live in a big city." Even a single-story new house, with an upper and lower level, can cost as much as 70 yuan per month in rent. This inevitably leads to overcrowding. On average, six families live in an ordinary city house. The Du family's cotton shop, which was hit by the fire yesterday, housed eight families. The living quarters were nearly full, including the reception hall, back kitchen, front building, back building, attic, front attic, and back attic. Dozens of people lived, rested, ate, and relieved themselves in this small space. It goes without saying that this is detrimental to hygiene, and with so many people, disasters are more likely to occur. Once a disaster strikes suddenly, even in broad daylight, it is difficult to escape one by one. Moreover, since it occurred at 4 AM, survival was unlikely.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Disaster Relief Knowledge: Among the more than three million citizens of Shanghai, only a small minority have knowledge and experience in fire prevention and disaster relief. If they unfortunately encounter a severe fire and lack external assistance, they can only wait to die. For example, among the residents of the First Special District who died in fires last year, there were 93 people. All 93 of these people died before the firefighters arrived. If people cannot save themselves, let alone save others, they are destined to perish together in the event of an accident. This is the reality, both pitiful and lamentable.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of Firefighting Equipment: Ordinary residences in the city are cramped and crowded, with little room to maneuver, and firefighting equipment is even more lacking. Landlords treat fire insurance policies as talismans, considering them unnecessary, while tenants who are just trying to make a living have no energy or resources to pay attention to this. The latest firefighting equipment is expensive, which may be impractical. However, the installation of simple things like fire extinguishing chemicals and fire hoses is easy to do, but they are completely lacking due to short-sightedness, laziness, and ingrained habits that are difficult to change. This is truly like the saying, "Swallows living in a hall think they are safe, but they do not know that the building is about to burn down."</p>
<p>To address this issue, we must: (1) The municipal authorities should strictly crack down on the abuses of "second landlords" who subdivide houses and charge exorbitant rents. The prerequisite is to stabilize the rise in general rents. (2) The work of building inspections and fire prevention, if it has been effective, must be gradually expanded in scope, and the methods must be stricter. Attention should be paid to the residential areas of the lower middle class and the factory areas. In the First Special District, areas such as Hongkou and Yangshupu have frequent fires and should be the focus of future efforts. (3) Arouse the public's interest in fire prevention and disaster relief. In early August of this year, the Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center held a fire drill in Zhuanqiao Town, which was very successful and can be promoted in a similar way. In Europe and the United States, there is an annual "Fire Prevention Day," during which everyone is excited and participates in activities, inspecting their homes or cleaning their residences. If they find anything that could cause danger, they remove it immediately without hesitation. Even a small match is carefully placed. This contains a very good intention and is of great value for us to imitate.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Impact of Silver Tax Collection on the International Scene: Comments from the London Financial News <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department has no criticism of China's imposition of an export tax on silver today. Responsible parties believe that the U.S. response is merely lip service. It is interpreted here that Secretary of State Hull repeatedly discussed the matter with Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau before issuing the response because the Treasury Department was unwilling to prevent the rise in silver prices. The actions taken by China now put the U.S. government in a difficult position. On the one hand, the silver lobby is seeking to raise prices quickly before the congressional elections, while on the other hand, the friendship and prosperity of China are also seen as necessary for the government's commercial policy. (14th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A major bullion broker told a Reuters reporter today that China has been forced by the U.S. silver policy and is now managing its silver reserves. The current tax rate should not be regarded as final. He believes that if the market price skyrockets, the tax rate will continue to increase, willing to make any sacrifice to maintain its main policy. China has now separated from the world and does not need to be forced to implement austerity measures to resist the currency exchange situation in the Far East caused by U.S. purchases. Any increase in the world silver price will enable China to implement austerity measures because the value of its silver reserves can increase due to the rise in world prices. He believes that there will be two silver prices in the future, one for China and one for the world. All major brokers believe that the continuous outflow of silver from China recently has forced the Chinese government to come up with this plan. Speculators now see China's increased silver tax as beneficial in many ways because China will no longer sell large quantities of silver in the future. However, another expert said that Chinese banks with silver deposits abroad can still sell them continuously because they can make quick profits. However, the current silver market is entirely controlled by speculators, so the future trend is extremely difficult to predict. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bombay: It is generally believed that the Chinese government's preparation to collect silver export tax is beneficial in many ways. The U.S. attitude has not changed yet. Local merchants are now watching the trend in London. The Bombay silver market did not open this morning because of a dispute between brokers and merchants over brokerage fees. It did not resume normal business until 2 PM. The silver price was 15 annas higher than the closing price on Saturday. (15th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The "Financial News" editorial today, discussing the effects of the U.S. silver policy, stated briefly: "China's protest against the U.S. silver policy has attracted the attention of the United States. In the future, the U.S. authorities will obviously take appropriate measures to purchase silver to avoid the improper absorption of other countries' reserves. However, it is clear that the U.S. silver purchase plan will continue. As for China, which is in a crisis of currency contraction due to the outflow of silver, it has now decided to impose a heavy tax on silver exports in order to cope with the situation. As a result, the price of silver will inevitably continue to rise. After China imposes a tax on silver exports, the U.S. demand for silver will not be affected, but the main source of silver supply will be greatly reduced. In this case, how can one expect the silver price not to continue to rise?" (15th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain diplomat said that the Marseille tragedy was a great misfortune for the international community. France has reorganized its cabinet because of this case, and Italy and Yugoslavia have engaged in provocative behavior. If it is not resolved in the short term, disputes are inevitable. As for the request by the Little Entente countries to the League of Nations Council to convene an emergency meeting, our authorities have not yet received a telegram from our representative office in Geneva. If a request is indeed made, the international community should gather to discuss a fair decision. As for our country, in addition to expressing condolences for the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia and hoping for an early resolution to avoid international disputes, no judgment should be made on anything else before the truth is clarified.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a telegram from the Chinese Association in Dutch Guiana to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, many overseas Chinese used to make a living there, but in recent years, restrictions on the entry of Chinese have increased. Recently, the local government has tightened restrictions even further. All overseas Chinese arriving in the port must bring 550 guilders in cash as a guarantee before being allowed to disembark. Also, because overseas Chinese often failed to redeem "white pigeon tickets," the government has vented its anger on all overseas Chinese, searching shops, inspecting pedestrians, and arbitrarily arresting people, refusing to issue business licenses, making it almost impossible for overseas Chinese to survive. It is feared that anti-Chinese tragedies will follow Mexico. The association urged the Commission to notify overseas Chinese in the motherland not to come, otherwise, they will either be unemployed or be in frequent danger. After receiving the telegram, the Commission consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and requested that it find a way to negotiate. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Anhui Native Association in Beijing telegraphed Chairman Chiang on the 15th, saying that the Anhui Provincial Government's approval to collect disaster relief grain was well-intentioned. However, after investigating the rice donation in Anhui Province in the past, there were deep-rooted malpractices, which only enriched corrupt officials. This time, although the name is grain collection, it is feared that donations will be collected at a fixed price, with understated reports and bribery for release, turning into a disguised likin, making those who benefit the people harm them instead, and those who help the poor make them poorer. You, sir, are compassionate and saving, so please send personnel to strictly supervise. If there is any corruption, they should be punished as if they embezzled relief funds, so that every penny can be used for public benefit and all disaster victims in Anhui can receive real benefits.

<p>Directly to the Far East via Hawaii</p>
<p>Cooperation with China National Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>(Washington) Juan Trippe, manager of Pan American Airways, wrote to Postmaster General Farley today, stating that the final plan for the Pacific air route from the United States to the Far East is now being prepared. On the American side, this route will connect with Pan American's air route in Central and South America, and on the Far East side, it will cooperate with the Sino-American-operated China National Aviation Corporation. Trippe said that Charles Lindbergh is currently leading the company's technical personnel to study whether the climate on the U.S. West Coast is suitable for opening the eastern terminus of the new air route. The company has also selected aircraft for use in the opening. The first flight will use a four-engine aircraft with a speed of 191 miles per hour. It is planned to conduct a test flight as soon as possible. Postmaster General Farley replied with great approval and predicted that both commercial and international relations would benefit. Trippe continued that the new route will pass through Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippine Islands. After opening, four-engine Sikorsky amphibious aircraft will fly from California to China, a journey of three days. The aircraft can accommodate 32 passengers. It is reported that China National Aviation Corporation also plans to resume the Shanghai-Hong Kong route in a few weeks, and the Hong Kong-Manila air route will be opened after the Pacific air route is realized.

<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru, who is tasked with conducting sideline activities among government officials in various countries during the London Naval Conference preparatory talks, departed from Tokyo Station at 1 PM this afternoon with a mission from Foreign Minister Hirota Koki. Vice Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and others went to the station to see him off. He will travel to Europe via Korea and Manchuria on the Siberian Railway and will visit Moscow, Berlin, Geneva, and London. He is scheduled to return to Japan via the United States next spring. Yoshida said upon departure that rumors of sideline activities during the Naval Conference preparatory talks, or of a special mission to negotiate directly with various governments, are not true. It is merely like a company director traveling for inspection. He is only carrying out Foreign Minister Hirota's instructions to report on the development of Japan and Manchuria to foreign envoys. He is expected to arrive in London by the end of November, go to the United States in January next year, and return to Japan around late February. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kokufu-tsu: Ambassador Yoshida made a statement in the car as follows: My trip this time is not to represent the Foreign Minister. It is originally to make the diplomats stationed abroad understand the intentions of our country. In the future, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should dispatch appropriate personnel to seek various contacts in order to cope with this serious period. I believe it is definitely necessary. As for the naval preparatory negotiations, the Japanese government has already decided on a strict fundamental policy, so there is no need for me to rush to deal with it. This time, I will first pass through the Soviet Union, Poland, and Germany, and then cross over to London. It would be even more desirable if I could reach Constantinople. This time, I may be able to convene a conference of major ambassadors abroad, or a meeting of consuls, in order to deal with this serious period, to implement our goals thoroughly without any omissions, in order to achieve thoroughness. On the way back, I plan to tour the United States and Canada, and I can return to the country around February next year. (15th Japan Federation News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Hayashi has been consulting with the Chief of Staff and the Inspector General of Military Education on personnel changes. As a result, the following policies have been decided: (1) Most of the army personnel in resident Manchurian agencies will be reformed from concurrently held positions. The number of selected personnel will be extremely small. (2) The regular personnel changes in December, except for urgent cases, will be extended to March next year. The current Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Hishikari, will reach the end of his term as general in November next year. Due to the Kwantung Bureau staff dispute, Hishikari will submit his resignation after the incident is resolved. Therefore, the Ministry of the Army will replace the Commander of the Kwantung Army in December, with Military Councillor General Minami Jiro succeeding him. (15th Japan Federation News Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important Meeting Between French and Czech Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>Renier Resigns as Minister of Justice</p>
<p>(Berlin) The future of relations between Germany and France is significant, so Germany must pay close attention to the successor of the French Foreign Minister. The new French Foreign Minister, Laval, was born in Chateldon, Auvergne, in 1883. Laval's family was poor, and the people of that region are known for their fortitude and perseverance, so Laval also possesses those traits. Most French politicians are familiar with the law, so Laval also practiced law. In 1914, he was first elected as a member of parliament, but he lost the election in 1919. He re-entered parliament in 1924 as a member of the Independent Socialist Party and also served as the mayor of Aubervilliers, a position he still holds. Laval joined Briand's cabinet in 1926 as Minister of Justice and later served as ministers in various cabinet departments. He resigned in 1931 and formed his own cabinet. In the autumn of that year, the global economic crisis began, and Laval and Foreign Minister Briand visited Germany together, the first time a French Prime Minister had visited Germany. Laval is now a member of the Senate but does not belong to any political party. It is said that his foreign policy will follow in the footsteps of Barthou and will not be changed. Landin, the successor to Laval as Colonial Minister, was born in 1879 and also practiced law. He has been a member of parliament since 1919 and has held important positions in the cabinet. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Doumergue met with Czech Foreign Minister Benes this morning to discuss international policy for an hour. Benes then met with Foreign Minister Laval and will continue talks tomorrow morning. Benes is one of the important diplomats of the Little Entente countries, and the discussions are likely to be related to the situation after the assassination of the King of Yugoslavia. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has been confirmed that Laval, the Colonial Minister, will succeed Barthou as Foreign Minister, and Marchandeau, the former Minister of Budget, will succeed Sarraut as Interior Minister. However, the successor to Minister of Justice Chéron after his resignation has not yet been determined. Prime Minister Doumergue recently asked the new Foreign Minister Laval to invite Renier, the general rapporteur of the Finance Committee of the Senate, to be the Minister of Justice. Renier was unwilling to accept the position and asked Laval to decline on his behalf, saying that he was very grateful for the Prime Minister's intention, but he could not accept it and was very sorry. Prime Minister Doumergue left the Prime Minister's office at 7:30 PM, saying that seeking opinions on the cabinet reshuffle had come to an end tonight. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Poincaré, the former great President of France, known as the "Savior of the Franc," passed away this morning at 3:30 AM due to illness. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At the time of Poincaré's death, only family members and his closest friends were at his bedside. His passing was unexpectedly swift, even doctors did not anticipate it. Poincaré had been partially disabled since undergoing surgery in 1929. However, when he returned to Paris from his country villa three weeks ago, he seemed in good health, able to meet with friends and continue dictating his autobiography. Poincaré was deeply saddened by the Marseille massacre on Tuesday and suddenly felt unwell last night. He called for a doctor, who said there was no cause for concern and decided to visit again this morning. However, he suddenly collapsed this morning and passed away at 3:30 AM. It is expected that the government will hold a state funeral for him. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is hereby decided that the state funeral for Poincaré will be held on October 20th. His remains will be laid in state at the Martyrs' Shrine until the funeral. French Prime Minister Doumergue will deliver the eulogy at the burial, which will take place in the Poincaré family cemetery in his hometown of Sampigny. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Poincaré's Last Appearance</p>
<p>Poincaré was one of the great figures in modern French politics. He occupied an important position in French politics before the European War, during the war, and even in the ten years after the war, just like Prime Minister Clemenceau. He served as Prime Minister for two terms after the European War, and resigned in late July 1929 due to illness, at the age of sixty-nine. He was first elected as a member of parliament in 1886, and from then on, he never left his political career. Until 1929, he served the country for a total of forty-three years. Poincaré was born on August 20, 1860, in Bar-le-Duc, Meuse. His father, Antoine (first name) Poincaré (last name), graduated from the École Polytechnique in Paris and worked as a bridge and road engineer. The great French mathematician Henri (first name) Poincaré (last name) was his cousin. Poincaré studied at a local middle school in his youth, and then went to the famous Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. After graduating, he studied law at the University of Paris, and then entered the Faculty of Arts, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1878. In 1879, Poincaré, at the age of thirty, was drafted into military service and assigned to the 26th Infantry Regiment in the western French region of Rennes. After completing his military service, he obtained the qualification of a reserve second lieutenant in the Alpine Chasseurs. He began practicing law on December 20, 1883. He won his first speech victory in 1883. In 1886, Agriculture Minister Develle appointed him as the chief secretary of the ministry. After 1888, he entered the Meuse Provincial Council and became the chairman of the council the following year. He was then elected as a member of the Chamber of Deputies by the business community and always maintained a moderate attitude. He was re-elected in subsequent elections and later became a Senator of the Progressive Party in Meuse. In the National Assembly, he served as the rapporteur for the budget. In 1893, he served as the Minister of Education, and later served as a cabinet member several times. In 1912, he served as the Prime Minister, and he was responsible for the negotiations with Germany over the Moroccan issue at that time. On January 17, 1913, he was elected as President by a vote of 429 to 327. When the European War broke out, Poincaré was in St. Petersburg, the capital of old Russia. On July 29, 1914, he rushed back to France and immediately mobilized the army. Poincaré was at the forefront of the French army's initial failures and the victory at the Marne. During the four years of the war, Poincaré constantly inspected the front lines, carefully observed the changes in the situation, and personally participated in the command of the war. Poincaré's hometown was Lorraine, which was lost during the Franco-Prussian War. Throughout his life, Poincaré was always wary of Germany. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, he rushed to Alsace-Lorraine to comfort the people and was delighted to see the restoration of the homeland. On January 10, 1920, he ratified the Treaty of Versailles. The National Assembly immediately declared that Poincaré had made great contributions to the country. On February 18, 1920, he left office after his term as president expired. He then became a Senator, and from 1922 to 1924, he served as Prime Minister again. At that time, Germany was unwilling to comply with the peace treaty. Poincaré worked hard to force Germany to fulfill its responsibilities. At the same time, there was speculation on the French franc. Poincaré reorganized the financial system and stabilized the French currency. The fact that the French franc is still a stable currency in the world today is due to Poincaré's efforts. It is not without reason that the French people regard Poincaré as the "Savior of the Franc." On May 11, 1924, after the re-election of the Chamber of Deputies, the Radical Socialist Party won a major victory. Poincaré resigned on his own initiative due to the change in the majority party in the National Assembly. However, he made a comeback in 1926 and organized a national unity cabinet to rectify the situation, just like the "Party Truce Cabinet" organized by Prime Minister Doumergue this time. In that year, France faced financial difficulties. Poincaré made the National Assembly pass a bill to reduce government spending, open up tax sources, and establish a public debt consolidation bureau to clear up the finances. For a time, the foreign exchange rate of the French franc rose and the financial situation greatly improved. He then signed the world-renowned Briand-Kellogg Pact. On July 27, 1929, his body was weakened and he could not bear the heavy work. After being advised by doctors, he resigned and went into retirement. After undergoing surgery, he gradually recovered. In June 1930, he returned to the Senate. In the winter of that year, his old illness recurred, and he retired to Sampigny or Paris, and did not hear about political affairs until now. He was elected to the Académie française in 1909 and often went in and out of the hospital. He has written extensively on history. Poincaré called it "Serving France." (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>The capital of Yugoslavia. After the assassination of the Yugoslav King, the entire Yugoslav people feel more spiritually united in the midst of adversity. This can be seen in the expression of Bishop Korošec today. Bishop Korošec was the former leader of the Catholic Party of the Slovenian people. He had previously been living in seclusion on Hvar Island. He specifically rushed from the island to Split to welcome the coffin of the late King Alexander. Korošec had previously been extremely opposed to the government. Seeing the coffin, he could not help but shed tears and said, "All the people of Yugoslavia have wept upon hearing of the King's misfortune. At this time, all previous grievances should be dispelled. We should work hard for the welfare of the Yugoslav state." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>The Assassination Aimed at Transforming the Yugoslav State</p>
<p>The capital of Yugoslavia. The true name and origin of the assassin who assassinated the King, who claimed to be Kalman and also Suke, has now been revealed after investigation. The person's real name is Vlada (first name) Georgieff (last name), also known as Chernozemsky, a Bulgarian, born in the mountains of Macedonia, Kamenica. Georgieff is well known in the Macedonian terrorist party. It has now been proven that the appearance of the Marseille assassin is identical to that of Georgieff. Georgieff had participated in several assassinations by the Macedonian "Ohrana" Revolutionary Party. In 1913, he was the personal chauffeur of "Ohrana" party leader Mihailov and was later used as a messenger, traveling between the "Vasdačist" group's operational center in a certain foreign country and Petrich. Petrich is Mihailov's headquarters in Bulgarian Macedonia. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Dispatch from the capital of Yugoslavia. The Marseille massacre is generally believed to have been initiated by the terrorist group "Vasdačist."

The discussion will mainly focus on the international situation created by the Marseille massacre. According to the original plan, the standing meeting of the four Balkan Entente nations was scheduled to be held in the Turkish capital on October 27. Later, it was decided to postpone the meeting.

<p>The Minister of Colonial Affairs, Persuaded by Okada, Changes to Issuing Recommendations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regardless of how calmly Prime Minister Okada observes the dispute over the reorganization of institutions in Manchuria, the situation cannot be eased. As a result, there is no other way than to implement the original plan as decided by the cabinet. At tomorrow's regular cabinet meeting, Army Minister Hayashi will make a strong statement, and Prime Minister Okada will also express his intention to implement the original plan. However, the local situation will worsen as a result, so the future of the political situation remains bleak. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada fears that the confrontation between the Army and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs over the reorganization of institutions in Manchuria will intensify. As a result, the rebuttal statement of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs against the Army was changed in form and published by Minister of State Kawada Han, in order to maintain the image of the Minister of Colonial Affairs. The content of the publication was unanimously revised by Prime Minister Okada, Minister of State Kawada Han, and Vice-Minister Tsubouchi, etc., from the strong opinions within the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. However, the fact that the Ministry of Colonial Affairs was persuaded has made the officials of the Kwantung Government feel that the Ministry of Colonial Affairs is unreliable, and their resistance is likely to intensify. It is worth noting whether Prime Minister Okada will continue to proceed with his previous tough attitude in the future. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Although yesterday was Sunday, the top officials of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs still held a meeting at the official residence of the Minister of Colonial Affairs to draft a rebuttal statement against the Army's statement on the Manchurian institutions issue. At 6:00 PM, Vice-Minister Tsubouchi, Bureau Chief Ikomawa, and Bureau Chief Kitajima visited Prime Minister Okada and Minister of State Kawada Han at the Prime Minister's official residence to explain the content of the draft rebuttal statement and requested understanding. The Prime Minister and Minister of State both opposed the publication of the statement and advised them to stop. Vice-Minister Tsubouchi and others also expressed their agreement, and only published the written recommendations from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs by Minister of State Kawada Han. The content of the recommendations is generally as follows: The Kwantung Government officials oppose the reform plan, not because of misunderstanding, but because of their belief in carrying out national policy in the best possible way. The main points of their opposition are the following three: (1) Appointing the Commander of the Military Police as the Chief of the Police Department; (2) Placing military officers in the Police Department; (3) Military police infringing on the duties of police officers, etc. In short, it is only to clarify the distinction between civil and military rule. Therefore, future countermeasures cannot be limited to improving the administrative structure, but the most important point is to obtain the support of the people. It is believed that it is necessary to devote oneself sincerely to this end. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs issued a proposal last night, and the Ministry of the Army is unwilling to refute it. However, its opinions are generally as follows: It is said that the Army and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs are in conflict and contention. Therefore, the Army does not want to refute the Ministry of Colonial Affairs' proposal. The proposal is a recommendation from all the officials of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs to the Minister of Colonial Affairs, which is an internal matter of the ministry. The original reform plan has already been passed by the cabinet, and Prime Minister Okada, who is also the Minister of Colonial Affairs, has also expressed his agreement. Now it cannot be changed. The Army hopes that the government will implement it as soon as possible. (Nichiren dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Mori, the Planning Section Chief of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and Hatta, the Police Affairs Section Chief, submitted their resignation letters to Okada, who is also the Minister of Colonial Affairs, today because of their anger at the dispute over the reform of institutions in Manchuria and their sense of responsibility for the local opposition to the cabinet-approved plan. The submission of the resignation letters of the two section chiefs caused a great shock to the entire Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and criticism of the top officials, including Vice-Minister Tsubouchi, has risen sharply. Given this situation, a collective resignation of the entire Ministry of Colonial Affairs may be difficult to avoid. The higher-ranking officials below the two section chiefs also seem likely to carry out a collective resignation because of their anger at the weak attitude of the top officials. Therefore, its progress is worth noting. On the other hand, non-commissioned officers, in order to encourage the higher-ranking officials, gathered in the conference room at noon today to create a resolution and hand it over to the higher-ranking officials. Therefore, the situation is deeply worrying. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tsubouchi, the Vice-Minister of Colonial Affairs, and Okada, who is also the Minister of Colonial Affairs, discussed the case of the resignation letters submitted by Section Chiefs Hatta and Mori on the afternoon of the 15th.

<p>(Tokyo) At 1:10 PM today, thirteen representatives of the Kwantung Government Police officers issued an informal statement in the form of a talk as follows:</p>
<p>Judging from the actual situation in Manchuria and from the perspective of implementing the Empire's national policy, we believe that the most perfect plan is the one proposed by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and we firmly believe that it will win the support of the Empire's public opinion. However, the government shattered it, leaving no trace. However, the imperial police officers who are responsible for maintaining peace and security in Manchuria and protecting the interests of the nation cannot stand by. Therefore, we have united with our colleagues and, based on the outline of the foundation of the nation, in order to establish civil administration, we have dispatched our representatives to Tokyo to make our beliefs and determination known to the world. It is deeply unexpected that some people are instigating the implementation of arbitrary politics in a corner of Manchuria and Mongolia. We will resolutely reject it. We will uphold the spirit of national construction, embody the will of the successive emperors, expand the responsibilities of civil and military affairs, and strive for unity through the co-prosperity of Japan and Manchuria, and build a world of peace and happiness. Although the strong political work of the military is needed, we are convinced that it is the duty of the administrative police to win over the hearts of the people and develop industries in order to serve the country's long-term interests. Therefore, we will move forward towards the goal we have been pursuing. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>

We have always opposed it. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Patrol Control Committee, the liaison organization of the hard-line faction of the Kwantung Government Police, because of the sudden tension in the central situation, needs to communicate with the patrol representatives who are staying in Tokyo.

The candidates have already been selected, and the preparations for dispatch have been completed. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Changchun) Director-General Hishikari made a final report to the government regarding the reform of institutions in Manchuria. In order to appease the officials of the Kwantung Government, he telegraphed Nakamura, the Director of the Kwantung Government, to come to Changchun quickly. Director Nakamura and Director of Documents, Mizutani, arrived in Changchun at 7:30 PM yesterday. They immediately visited Director-General Hishikari at the embassy. Director Nakamura presented the overall intention of the Kwantung Government officials, which is that the government must adopt one of the following three options: (1) The government takes responsibility for the decision to make an unreasonable reform plan; (2) Fundamentally change the reform plan; (3) Postpone the implementation. One of the three must be chosen, otherwise the current state of disarray among the Kwantung Government officials cannot be resolved at all. Therefore, Director-General Hishikari's appeasement and mediation can be regarded as definitely hopeless. After the meeting, Director Nakamura told reporters that he was very sorry for Director-General Hishikari, but judging from the current situation, if the government does not choose one of the above three, there is no way to solve the problem. Moreover, the basis for the Army's statement that the Commander of the Military Police should concurrently serve as the Chief of the Police Department is very weak. (Den-tsu dispatch, 15th)</p>

In addition, Germany also stated that those who hold Dawes bonds from the United States will only be able to receive three-quarters of the interest due today. The situation has become even more serious. Although official criticism has not yet been issued, it is understood that the US government believes that the proposal to reduce the Dawes loan interest is simply discrimination against the United States, as Germany will still pay the full interest to those who hold Dawes bonds from the other seven countries. The abolition of the most-favored-nation commercial treaty is inconsistent with the policy of Secretary of State Hull. Hull advocates the expansion of most-favored-nation treatment and the removal of international trade barriers. Therefore, the State Department is quite cold to the German Ambassador Dr. Luther's suggestion to begin negotiations to revise the commercial treaty. The current US-German commercial treaty will remain in effect until October 13 of next year. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">British Air Race <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>To Begin on the 20th of This Month</p>
<p>Pilots from Around the World Report</p>
<p>(London) Crowds gathered at the Mildenhall airfield in Suffolk, England, today to see the arrival of famous pilots from around the world, as the air race between London and Melbourne will begin on the 20th of this month. All participating pilots must report today. A total of twelve aircraft arrived today, including seven British, two New Zealand, and one each from Denmark, Australia, and the United States. In addition, there are two aircraft each from the United States and the Netherlands. Because the aircraft are very large, they have already reported in Martlesham. It is reported that nine aircraft have been granted an extension to report. However, two of these nine aircraft are still in the United States and it is doubtful whether they will be able to participate on time. There are also two Italian aircraft that have not yet arrived, but if they arrive in Mildenhall within the next few days, they will be allowed to join the competition. Therefore, the final list of participants has not yet been finalized. It is estimated that about twenty-three aircraft will depart from England on October 20. The famous British pilots Mr. and Mrs. Mollison will also join the race at that time. They will use a twin-engine "Comet" monoplane, which was specially made by the de Havilland company. Its construction and contents are currently kept secret, but it is known that it can fly 2,000 miles with a full tank of fuel and has a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour. Among the US participants is Pangborn, who made a non-stop flight from Japan to the United States in October 1931, and Polando, who flew directly from New York to Istanbul in 1931. The Royal Aero Club of the United Kingdom is responsible for taking care of the race from the United Kingdom to Kupang, while the Melbourne Air Race Committee manages the area from Kupang to Melbourne. Traffic and observation matters throughout West Malaysia have been arranged, and pilots can receive assistance at any time. Police, doctors, public works personnel, and Boy Scouts have all taken on rescue duties. Telephones and wires have been installed everywhere to meet the needs of the pilots. Hourly weather reports are also published at various key points for the participants' reference. It is expected that the participants in this race will all be long-distance, fast planes, and most will fly directly from Allahabad in India, across a thousand miles of sea, to Singapore.

<p>(Nanjing) Sa Fojun, the Director of the Railway Department, who was sent to the United States this spring to investigate railway engineering in various countries, has returned to Nanjing. According to him, the most important thing I was ordered to investigate was railway steel rails, water-land transport terminals, and station projects. I left the country in March and went to the United States first. Our country's steel rail standard is 85 pounds, while the standard weight of the latest rails in the United States has increased to 150 pounds, a difference of almost double. However, after investigating in European countries, most still use 90- to 95-pound steel rails. However, the railway industry in Europe and the United States is no longer what it used to be. Business is declining and income is decreasing period by period. The main reason is the development of roads and their fierce competition with railways. Currently, travelers in countries with good roads prefer to drive cars rather than take trains. However, governments are still making great efforts to maintain railway operations. Recently, various countries have paid great attention to improving the mechanical engineering of trains, so there has been considerable success. The United States now has the latest streamlined trains running in New York, Germany has the Hamburg Flyer, France has invented the Beaumont train, and the Netherlands has the Hord diesel-electric train. Their forms are different from ordinary trains, they are lighter in weight, and their speeds are extremely high. A study report is currently being drafted. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Singapore Naval Base in the Eyes of the British <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>For Defending Australia from Japanese Invasion</p>
<p>Does Not Advocate Interfering with the Japanese Invasion of China</p>
<p>Singapore Special Correspondent The Singapore is the naval base of the British Far East Navy. The importance of its position was stated in my previous communication, and I think readers can remember it. The Singapore-based Sunday Times published yesterday another airmail special communication from London, dated September 12th, which excerpted a text recently disclosed by British government figure Sir Russell in the naval military record. This article not only provides a frank explanation of the position of Singapore in the future world war, but also clearly expresses the British position on the United States and Japan. Sir Russell also said that "Britain does not need to interfere with the Japanese invasion of China, but should protect British interests in China and exchange conditions with Japan," which further shows the British attitude towards Japan, which is very important to us. I have therefore translated the main points below for the reference of my compatriots in the motherland.</p>
<p>Sir Russell's original text first analyzes the composition and utilization of a huge naval base. It is said that the use of a new-style naval base is actually more than just a convenient facility for accommodating warships. There are many convenient harbors that can accommodate large ships in the Pacific, and there are many that belong to Britain. However, there is a big difference between peacetime and wartime. The construction of a new naval base is mainly due to political and military considerations. It is also said that the Singapore naval base at the tip of the Malay Peninsula is not designed to deal with any country, but is intended to defend and prevent any country from using naval power to deal with any British territory and disrupt British trade. But in reality, defense also depends on real strength. If this kind of strength is used for aggression, it becomes an aggressive force. But what will be the attitude of the aggressor? This is not usually predictable. They secretly plant their amazing power while maintaining the appearance of peace and friendship, but they are always ready to attack. In the Pacific, the countries known as naval powers are the United States and Japan. Our peace politicians will exclude the United States from the targets of war, because it is unthinkable to fight against the United States. However, I have never seen any remarks from the United States that it is unthinkable to fight against Britain. On the contrary, the United States has a lot of discussion, comparing the British Navy as a target for shooting. This is truly an open and unfriendly attitude. Not long ago, a high-ranking official in the Japanese political world made a statement about the attitude that country has adopted towards China. That kind of statement was too shocking, and major American newspapers headlined "We must act in concert with Britain." I feel that this headline is very noteworthy, because the degree of understanding between us and the so-called high-level newspapers in the United States is too poor. Everyone can guess the idea behind the above-mentioned American newspaper's request, because the American Navy's request is to enable the United States to effectively exert its own goals without acting jointly with any country. Secondly, the American newspaper then discussed the possibility of Singapore being used, saying that the Japanese government exchanged a conciliatory attitude, saying that the diplomats who made the declaration were not authorized to speak by the Japanese government, and what they said was misunderstood. This statement aroused further anxiety in the United States, and the anxiety caused to Britain by this statement was less than that of the United States. Although Japan explained it, it still could not explain the doubts of the United States, so the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia was promoted by this. Because Russia itself has no way to deal with Japan's naval power, but if Russia and the United States unite, then Russia's Vladivostok will be able to serve as a base for the American fleet, but this hope can only be realized if the American fleet can arrive there first. Singapore is too far from Japan. When a war breaks out between Japan and China, Hong Kong is vulnerable to severe attacks. This may be the reason why Britain proposed at the Washington Conference that it would not build fortresses and equip armaments in Hong Kong, but would exchange the construction of a naval base in Singapore. However, the purpose of building a port in Singapore is clearly an appropriate interception position for Japan's naval advance towards Australia. The islands in the Pacific entrusted to Japan's rule are often regarded as defensible submarine bases, but these islands have no hiding places and are not easy to defend. If they are attacked by air, it will be very difficult to resist. However, if Japan is at war with any naval power, it may be possible to defend as much as possible, but it is not known. In my (Russell himself) view, that kind of war will occur in the period when Japan acts against China without regard to the intervention of the powers. Once the war begins, no strong country in the world can use its own power to expel Japan from the Chinese territory, because Japan will place its battleships in the inland sea of ​​China, and at the same time use its fleet to maintain traffic. I do not think that expelling the Japanese naval fleet from the Chinese territory is a matter for our British people. If the League of Nations carries out the League Covenant in a sacred manner and orders the British fleet to carry out this task, then the Geneva Palace of Peace will soon close its doors, because this kind of event is not our responsibility. If we are not so crazy and chivalrous, then we may be able to sign the first treaty with "Manchukuo", and our merchant ships will not have to stick to it and let them rust and rot, but this is another theory. Japan's inevitable initiation of a world war is as undoubtedly certain as the sun will rise tomorrow, but what we hope is that when Japan launches it, it will not take the shortcut of finding a new world position in British territory. If China cannot concentrate its full strength to resist due to pirates and bandits, even though Britain has huge trade interests in China, I have not seen that Britain should come out to interfere. Japan will exchange the protection of British trade interests in China for Britain's non-interference. The purpose of the United States is, in any case, to consider its own interests. The United States may once again oppose Japan's further aggression against China, but I must repeat this statement, the United States is considering its own interests. The real task of the Singapore naval base is to strengthen the strength to safeguard British territorial interests. This kind of interest does not require us to cooperate with other powers. If we cooperate with other powers, the responsibilities we bear will be beyond the original plan.</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned remarks of Sir Russell, we can know that the time for coordination between Britain and the United States is still far away, and the concept of Britain's pro-Japan is still very strong. What is the background of Britain's recent dispatch of a European industrial inspection team and our country's failure to be elected to the League of Nations Council? Sharp-eyed people should be able to see it.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Chiang Kai-shek's Visit to Luoyang <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Attending the Opening Ceremony of the Military Branch School</p>
<p>Inspecting the Ordnance Factory in Gong County</p>
<p>And Taking a Special Train to Xi'an from Luoyang</p>
<p>Luoyang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, along with Zhang Xueliang and others, arrived in Luoyang. Their special train departed from Hankou at 8:00 AM on the 9th and arrived in Zhengzhou at 3:00 AM on the 10th. They immediately transferred to the Longhai Railway westward, arriving at Luoyang West Station at 10:00 AM. Zhu Shaozhou, the director of the Central Military Academy Branch School, Gao Guizi, the commander of the 84th Division, Wang Cifu, the concurrently serving county magistrate of Luoyang County, Chen Dabai, the director of the Central Plains Social Education Center, as well as He Yingqin, Liu Zhi, and others who had arrived in Luoyang the day before, and representatives from all walks of life, all came to the station to welcome them. The station platform was heavily guarded by soldiers of the 84th Division and county police. Chiang Kai-shek alighted from the train amidst the strains of military music and exchanged brief greetings with the welcomers before proceeding by car to the Military Academy Branch School in Xigong to attend the opening ceremony. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the Xigong Central Army Military Academy Branch School was originally scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 10th, and a National Day celebration was to be held at the same time. However, due to the late arrival of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's special train at 10:00 AM, the entire body lined up on Zhongzheng Road to welcome him. The opening ceremony was then changed to 11:00 AM. After Chiang Kai-shek arrived at the Xigong Military Branch School and rested briefly, he immediately held a military review. Besides the 2,000 officers and training class of the Military Academy Branch School and the sergeant instructors, there were also two regiments of the 84th Division stationed in Luoyang. The large parade ground in front of Guanghan Palace was extremely lively at that moment. After the commander-in-chief reported the number of personnel to Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang immediately rode a black steed with Zhang Xueliang, He Yingqin, Liu Zhi, and others, and inspected them for a week, then held a march-past. The troops were full of spirit, and Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Xueliang, and others praised them greatly. After the review, Chiang Kai-shek first gave a speech, roughly saying that in commemorating National Day, we must not forget the martyrs who died during the revolution. After He Yingqin and Zhang Xueliang finished their speeches, a luncheon was held. At 2:00 PM, he attended the opening ceremony of the Peace Elementary School attached to the Military Academy Branch School. Chiang Kai-shek first went to the school, toured around for a week, guided by Zhu Shaozhou, and asked in detail about the school's construction process. Then the opening ceremony was held. Chiang Kai-shek first gave a speech, roughly saying, "Children, today is October 10th, hence the name 'Double Tenth.' We are all people of the Chinese nation, and the Republic of China was born today, so we are all here to celebrate it today. Who gave birth to the Republic of China? It was our Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen, so when we commemorate National Day, we must firmly remember our Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen." Finally, he encouraged the children of the school to be filial to their parents, respect their teachers, and become good citizens in the future. Afterwards, a photograph was taken. At that moment, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, arrived from the city, and Zhu Shaozhou immediately greeted her at the entrance. After Madame Chiang arrived at the meeting place, she sat beside Chiang Kai-shek, and another group photo was taken. At 3:00 PM, a special party branch of the Military Academy was established. Chiang Kai-shek personally came to give a speech, detailing the significance of establishing the party branch. Next, He Yingqin gave a speech, urging the military academy to work on three points for the party. Finally, Wang Chaofan, a central representative, gave a speech as the supervisor of the election. After the ceremony was over, Chiang Kai-shek and his wife took the same car back to the special train headquarters at the West Station.</p>
<p>On the 11th, at 8:00 AM, Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Zhang Xueliang, He Yingqin, Liu Zhi, and others, took a special train to Gong County Ordnance Factory for inspection. At 11:00 AM, Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang took the same special train back to Luoyang. He Yingqin took the Longhai Railway's special express train, passed through Zhengzhou, and returned to Nanjing, reportedly staying in Nanjing for a few days to handle affairs of the Ministry of Military Administration before going to Shanghai to pay respects at the mourning of He's mother-in-law, Madame Wang. Liu Zhi got off the train at Sishui, inspected the county's administration, and then went straight back to Kaifeng. Chiang Kai-shek's special train returned to Luoyang West Station. At 2:00 PM, he and his wife took a car to the Luoyang Zhougong Temple Central Plains Social Education Center for inspection. The center was sponsored by Dai Jitao and Niu Yongjian, the two presidents of the Examination Yuan. When repairing the Zhougong Temple, Chiang Kai-shek had donated a large sum of money. After Chiang Kai-shek arrived at the center, he was led by Chen Dabai, the director of the center, to inspect the Dingding Hall, the Stele Forest, and other projects, and visited the public reading room, public school, Luojing Park, and other places. Chiang Kai-shek and his wife greatly admired the beauty of the center's environment. After the inspection, they returned to the headquarters. That night at 11:00 PM, they took a special train to Xi'an with Zhang Xueliang. Secretary-General Yang Yongtai and others followed.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek stayed in Luoyang for two days. In addition to attending the opening ceremony of the Military Academy Branch School and inspecting various places, He Yingqin, Liu Zhi, and others gave detailed reports on local defense. It is said that Chiang Kai-shek will also visit Kaifeng after inspecting Xi'an (12th).</p>
<h3 id="e104">Sixth Route Army Captures Gulonggang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Pseudo Eighth Army Corps Has Already Collapsed</p>
<p>Ningdu and Xingguo Will Be Taken Soon</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Gulonggang is located in the north of Xingguo and runs parallel to the county towns of Ningdu and Xingguo. To the south is the main road to Yudu and Ruijin. The bandits regarded Gulonggang as important in the central part of southern Jiangxi, so they deployed the newly formed pseudo Eighth Army Corps, Zhou Kun's 22nd, 23rd, and 24th divisions, and the Xingguo Yongfeng Independent Regiment to build fortifications in sections in the area west of Xingguo and south of Yongfeng, to prevent the National Army from advancing south. However, the Sixth Route Army, advancing south from Yongfeng Longgang, gradually built bunkers towards Gulonggang, opened roads, and advanced south in sections. The divisions of Ou Zhen and Liang Huasheng fought dozens of battles, large and small, and completely destroyed the bandit's fortifications on the dangerous mountains from Longgang to Pinghu. On the 7th, they attacked the positions of the pseudo 21st and 23rd divisions entrenched in Tianzisheng, Fengche'ao, Fenshui'ao, and Lotus Mountain. Starting on the 9th, they used infantry, artillery, and air force to attack the bandit positions again, taking a three-sided encirclement. On the morning of the 10th, they captured the bandit nest of Gulonggang. The entire pseudo Eighth Army Corps collapsed and fled to Qingtang Mountain in Ningdu. The National Army is still following up. Gulonggang is only twenty or thirty miles east of Ningdu. The Sixth Route Army's victory here, together with the Third Route Army advancing west from Shicheng, has formed a pincer attack. The bandits in Ningdu will be cut into two pieces by the Third and Sixth Route Armies. The situation of Xingguo City being surrounded on three sides has also been formed. Therefore, the capture of Gulonggang is a prelude to the capture of the two county towns of Ning and Xing. The connection between the bandits in Ning and Xing counties has also been cut off, and their disintegration is imminent. (October 12th)</p>

<p>Telegram Sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The local Cotton Textile Industry Association, having heard that the government intends to implement an increase in the consolidated tax from November 1st of this year, convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. It was resolved to immediately draft and send telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai Cotton Control Committee, appealing for exemption from the increase. The original text reads: "Recently, we heard news of an increase in the consolidated tax on cotton yarn. The rumors are spreading, and the industry is alarmed. The association's Shenxin No. 3, Zhenxin, Qingfeng, Guangqin, Lixin, Yukang, and Fuxing factories, due to the dumping of Japanese goods and the decline of the rural economy, are on the verge of bankruptcy. On July 17th of this year, we sent a telegram appealing for a reduction in the consolidated tax, but it was not approved. We are still in a state of anxiety when shocking news arrived that the government is planning to increase taxes. This is tantamount to strangling the dying and hastening its death. We recently read reports that the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Factory Federation and the Hubei Branch have sent telegrams appealing for relief. The factories of the association, being located inland, feel the pain of the great depression of yarn factories in recent years even more acutely. If the government truly intends to increase taxes, we earnestly request that you consider the deep pain and wounds of the domestic cotton textile industry, which can hardly bear any further burden. Please immediately cancel this proposal; otherwise, the livelihood of the manufacturers will be destroyed, and the government's tax revenue will also dry up. Both will suffer. The factories of the association, under urgent and pressing circumstances, are sending this telegram to beg for mercy. If our request is not granted, we will have no choice but to suspend operations and await orders. We pray earnestly, hoping for your consideration. Tsai Chien-san, Chairman of the Wuxi County Cotton Textile Industry Association, kowtows in寒 (cold) (humble)." (15th)</p>

<p>The county government here, in order to implement the use of the new system of weights and measures, specially invited grain merchants from the five counties of Wuxi, Kunshan, Wujiang, Wujin, and this county yesterday (15th) to a meeting to discuss the date of changing to the new system. Zhao Zixin from Wuxi, Chen Junyu, Zhou Hongqing, and Xu Jusheng from this county, and representatives from Jiang, Kun, Chang, and other counties, totaling more than twenty people, attended. During the discussion, Wuxi argued that the conversion of the old system to the new system in the city would result in a difference of six to seven liters of rice per stone (unit of dry volume), making reform difficult in the short term. However, the county government expected immediate implementation, so the meeting did not end until 5:00 PM.</p>

Around 2:00 AM the day before, twenty to thirty local bandits suddenly arrived, with white cloths wrapped around their heads, each holding iron rulers, wooden sticks, flashlights, and other weapons. They broke down the door and entered. Yao's wife, Wu, carrying a child, hid on the roof. Shuangfu obtained a gong and also escaped to the roof to sound the alarm. The bandits realized that things were not going well and immediately pulled out fake pistols and set off firecrackers several times to show off their power. They then grabbed Shuangfu, beat him, and forced their way into the house, looting extensively. They stole cash, clothes, etc., worth about three hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Twelve pirate ships suddenly appeared on the Lusi Sea, and the pirates occasionally opened fire on the shore. They also landed on Yangjiazhao Shoal and seized twelve fishing families. The situation is very rampant. Peng Zhufeng, the head of Lusi District, flew to the county government overnight to report. County Magistrate Jin immediately dispatched a security team to defend and suppress the pirates and requested the Fourth District Security Command to dispatch the Provincial Water Police Team to Lusi to intercept them.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3 id="e117">Letter from the Xihulu Road Engineering Office <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I read a news article in your newspaper's Changshu Correspondence column on the 14th of this month titled "First Opening of the Xichang Highway Results in Overturn." This is not in accordance with the facts. The bridge and culvert engineering of the Xichang section of this road has indeed been completed, and the improvement of the roadbed is currently being carried out by the relevant county governments in accordance with the regulations of this office. Before the completion of the improvement project, there was no opening to traffic, nor was there any order from the department to open the road within this month. However, the United Federation of Private Electric Power Companies previously sent a letter requesting temporary opening of the dirt road on the Xichang section of the road for their annual meeting, so that members could enjoy the scenery along the way. This office responded with a formal letter stating that the roadbed was not solid and it was not appropriate to open the road to vehicles, politely declining the request. Subsequently, the annual officials of the association planned to conduct a test drive on the Xichang section of the road before it was opened to traffic. Therefore, on the 12th of this month, they hired a car to go for a test drive on their own. As a result, the wheels got stuck in a ditch and could not move forward. There was no overturning, nor were there any technology department officials present. Fearing that the rumors are inaccurate and could mislead the audience, we have written to you specifically requesting correction. Sincerely, Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department Xihulu Road Engineering Office, Editorial Department of Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>

<p>Written Statement: Very Good Impression of Guangdong</p>
<p>To Visit Chiang Kai-shek in the North and Attend the Fifth National Congress</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Chiang Po-cheng, a member of the Peiping Branch of the Military Council, who went to Guangdong in May under the orders of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the military suppression of bandits, completed his official duties and left Guangdong for Hong Kong on the 9th. On the 12th, he boarded the Grand President of the Dollar Steamship Company and arrived in Shanghai. The ship entered the port at dawn yesterday and docked at the Dollar Wharf in Pudong. Mayor Wu specially sent Secretary Tang Shixuan, along with Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang stationed in Nanjing, and Chiang Po-cheng's wife, to Pudong on the customs' Jingguang small steamship to welcome him. They then boarded the original ship and crossed the river together. At 8:30 AM, they arrived at the new customs wharf and went straight to the residence to rest. After arriving in Shanghai, Chiang immediately telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to inquire about the location for a meeting. Once he receives instructions, he will go to meet and report everything, and then go to Beijing to attend the Fifth National Congress. Chiang published a written statement on the ship, saying, "I was ordered to be stationed in Guangdong for more than four months and have a very good impression of Guangdong. In Guangdong, Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang and Chairman Lin Yunhai, etc., are working hard to govern, and with the joint efforts of the advanced members of our party and the people, are determined to implement a three-year plan. Significant progress has been made in land registration, household surveys, road construction, industrial revitalization, educational promotion, financial reorganization, guard training, and the application of the four powers. As for Commander-in-Chief Chen and the advanced members of the party-state, their painstaking efforts to maintain the overall situation can be said to prioritize the entire party-state. Recent rumors are excessive speculations. Because the Red Bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi will soon be exterminated and the Fifth National Congress is about to open, I plan to go north to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the next few days to report everything, and then go to Beijing to attend the conference."</p>

<p>Today, the first drawing for redemption of the six-percent sterling boxer indemnity bonds of 1934 is being held. We are honored to have the representatives from the three Ministries of Finance, Railways, and Audit supervising, and the representatives from the various organizations visiting, and the banks accepting the bonds providing valuable assistance. I would like to briefly report on the issuance and drawing of these bonds. These bonds were jointly issued by the Ministries of Finance and Railways, with a fixed amount of 1.5 million pounds sterling and an annual interest rate of six percent, for the purpose of completing the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The funds for redemption and interest payment are from the Boxer Indemnity returned by the British to the Ministry of Railways (domestic portion), which is allocated monthly and kept by this committee. Interest and principal will be paid twice a year, on January 1st and July 1st, for a total of twelve and a half years. The order of redemption will be determined by drawing. January 1st, 1935, is the date for the first redemption, and the drawing will be carried out today. All drawing methods and procedures have been printed into a booklet with detailed explanations, which will be distributed on the spot and will not be repeated. I will now begin the drawing. The supervisors are requested to first examine the same two copies of each of the 1,000 bonds, put them into the drawing drums, and then apply them alternately and draw in rotation.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Drawing Procedures <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The chairman explained that first the 50-pound bonds will be drawn, then the 100-pound bonds, and then the 1,000-pound bonds. There are 68 50-pound bonds to be redeemed this time, one bond per draw, so 68 draws should be drawn, divided into two groups, with 34 draws per group. Each group has 1,000 bonds, which are loaded into the barrels. An average of 3 draws is conducted in each barrel, for a total of 30 draws. There are still 4 draws to be added to a barrel. 10 additional labels were prepared. Before the drawing, the added barrel number was first drawn. The chairman asked the supervisors to check the 1,000 labels of the three-digit number labels of the first group. The labels should be pre-divided into 20 editions with 50 labels per edition arranged neatly for inspection. After the ticket number in the ticket log of the first group has been verified, the supervisors will store the labels in 10 barrels in order, 100 labels per barrel. The chairman requested the supervisor to check the barrel labels and immediately draw the additional barrel labels. The supervisor will verify and then draw the additional 4 barrel labels. The reporting staff will report to the chairman and announce it on the spot. This time, 1 label each will be added to the 1st No. 1-whatever number barrel, No. 2-whatever number barrel, No. 3-whatever number barrel, and No. 4-whatever number barrel, which are sent to the record seat for registration. The chairman requested the drawing staff to take turns drawing in turn, for a total of 34 draws. The drawn labels will be reported to the chairman by the attendants and announced on the spot, i.e. which number won, and sent to the record seat for registration separately, and written on the blackboard. After the first group drawing is completed, after each group drawing is completed, the drawn label number is written on the blackboard, and the attendants must put the drawn labels back into the original barrel for sorting. After the first group drawing is completed, the barrel labels and the second group labels and the label register should be sorted and prepared for inspection. The number of wins and win certificates recorded in the subsequent group label book will be sent to the chairman and all the members, and the supervisor for review, and the certificate will be signed and sealed.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Silver Export Tax Collection Started Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>This can prevent a large outflow in the future.</p>
<p>However, attention must be paid to the development of international trade.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that since the U.S. government raised the price of silver to buy existing silver, a large amount of silver has flowed out of our country, which has had a significant impact on social finance. The silver and money industries and other four associations in this city have paid close attention to this and have petitioned the Ministry of Finance to increase the silver export tax to prevent this. This has been approved and implemented yesterday. Because the matter arose suddenly, about 9 million yuan that had already been loaded onto ships yesterday were returned. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Implemented Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The increased silver export tax rate was approved by the Ministry of Finance and was instructed to the Customs Administration the night before last (the 14th) to be implemented yesterday. After receiving the order, the Customs Administration immediately forwarded it to the Inspector General of Customs, as well as to the superintendents and commissioners of all customs houses, to comply with and handle accordingly. The Jianghai Customs, due to the urgency of the matter, did not have time to make a public announcement yesterday. However, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, convened a meeting of Chinese and foreign bankers in this city at his residence on West Adams Road the night before last and explained the measures for increasing the export tax.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Calculation Method <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The tax rate formulated by the Ministry of Finance: (1) Silver standard currency will be subject to an export tax of 10%, minus the minting fee of 2.25%, resulting in a net tax of 7.75%. (2) Large bars of silver will be subject to an export tax of 10%. (3) The equalization tax will be calculated based on the difference between the ratio of the London silver price and the Shanghai exchange rate and the exchange rate determined by the market on that day. If the payment of the above export tax is still insufficient, it will be made up. At 11:30 AM yesterday, the Central Bank announced the equalization tax to be 4.75%. The calculation method is as follows: The London silver price of 24 and 3/8 pence last Saturday is multiplied by the statutory number 8165744, and the sum is 1 shilling and 7 pence and 15/16, minus the Shanghai market price of 1 shilling, 5 pence and 3/4 at 11:30 AM that day. The difference is 2 and 3/16 pence, which is equal to 12.5%, minus 7.75%, which means that the equalization tax to be levied is 4.75%. Therefore, the tax to be levied on silver coins is 12.5%, and the tax to be levied on fixed silver is 14.75%.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Silver Reserves <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>After the sudden implementation of the silver export tax yesterday, those who had already loaded goods onto ships but had not cleared customs returned them one after another. According to the Customs' announcement yesterday, a total of 9.25 million yuan of silver was returned, including 8.52 million yuan in silver dollars and 730,000 yuan in silver bars, mostly loaded by foreign banks onto the President Grant and the Kalheshlin ships for shipment to the United States. Therefore, foreign banks expressed surprise at the Chinese government's swiftness in implementing the tax increase. As for the city's silver reserves, on the 2nd of this month, there were 52,610,000 taels of silver, of which 22,880,000 taels were held by Chinese banks, 346,510,000 yuan in silver dollars, of which 243,600,000 yuan were held by Chinese banks, and 7,980 silver bars, all owned by Chinese banks. On September 26th of last year, the silver reserves were 137,495,000 taels and 298,780,000 yuan, of which 45,360,000 taels and 179,120,000 yuan were held by Chinese banks.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Official Statement <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>According to a senior member of the banking community who spoke to reporters, the Ministry of Finance's implementation of the silver export tax increase can prevent the continued large-scale export of silver and stabilize public confidence. However, after implementation, it can only prevent the outflow of silver caused by the U.S. raising the price of silver. Our country has always been a country with an import surplus, so it is still inevitable that silver will flow out due to the difference in international trade. In the future, people must pay close attention to the development of international trade. Our silk and tea industries' international trade has failed, and the reason lies in the fact that our merchants do not understand the market conditions and social needs of various countries. Therefore, people must first investigate the needs of various countries and develop exports, so as to offset imports and exports and avoid the outflow of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Inauguration of the Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the National Economic Commission's Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office, after the appointment of Liu Weizhi, the permanent vice minister of the Ministry of Industry, as the director, and Ye Yuanxin as the deputy director, was established at 113 Jiujiang Road. Yesterday was the official opening day of the office. Chen Guangfu, the chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Commission, specially invited all committee members to participate. Those who attended included Chen Guangfu, Zhang Gongquan, Bei Songsun, Liu Weizhi, Ye Yuanxin, Guo Shun, He Bingxian, Nie Lusheng, Tang Shenghai, Li Shengbo, Xu Caicheng, Zou Bingwen, Chen Bozhuang, Mu Ouchu, etc. After the ceremony, Chen Guangfu first delivered a speech on behalf of the Cotton Control Committee, followed by a reply from Director Liu Weizhi, a report on the preparatory work by Deputy Director Ye, and finally a speech by Mu Ouchu. The speeches of each person are recorded below: (A)</p>
<h3 id="e132">Chen Guangfu's Speech <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>He said, "Today is the inauguration day of the Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office. Director Liu Jisheng attaches importance to pragmatism and does not want extravagance. Therefore, today's inauguration ceremony is held only within our association's regular meeting. The participants are also limited to the members of this office. As for the opinions to be expressed to the outside world, Mr. Jisheng has indicated that he will choose another date to hold it after taking office. The malpractice of cotton adulteration has a history of at least 50 years in China. Since the establishment of this committee in October last year, we have formulated four major guidelines for improving our country's raw cotton plan. In short, (1) Improve and increase the quality and quantity of cotton production nationwide to offset the import of more than 100 million yuan of foreign cotton each year, and even establish cotton production, transportation, and sales cooperatives to organize our country's cotton farmers and promote the committee's plan to improve cotton production nationwide. At the same time, we will also communicate with financial institutions so that municipal funds can help cotton farmers improve cotton production. (3) Train cotton grading personnel and send them to various cooperatives to conduct cotton grading so that cotton nationwide can gradually be graded using scientific methods to seek fair treatment in trade. The above matters have been handled by the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, as well as the cotton watering and adulteration problems in Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces. This matter requires the Legislative Yuan to pass the prohibition regulations and the Executive Yuan to pass the detailed rules for the implementation of the prohibition regulations, so it will inevitably be delayed. Therefore, the Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office can only be established today. Among the provinces that have established provincial prohibition offices, there are Henan and Shaanxi. Hubei, Hebei, and Shandong provinces will soon be established. The prohibition business in Jiangsu Province will be handled concurrently by the Central Prohibition Office. According to the detailed rules, Shanghai City should be handled by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. Other cotton-producing provinces, such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan, have all sent people to contact and are in preparation. What is particularly admirable is that this time, the committee's implementation of the prohibition of cotton watering and adulteration is not only a joint effort by the central and provincial governments, but also yarn merchants and cotton merchants across the country can uphold the government's intention to improve the cotton industry and obey the orders carefully. The Ministry of Industry presides over the national industry. Today, Vice Minister Liu Jisheng is specially appointed as the director of the Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office of this committee, which shows its importance to this matter. This cannot but be specially thanked to the Ministry of Industry on behalf of this committee. Finally, Guangfu has a word to tell the gentlemen of this committee, that our country is the most suitable country for cotton production. If the improvement and promotion are done in the right way, not only can the import of raw cotton worth hundreds of millions of yuan be reduced, but also the eastern neighbor, Japan, purchases American and Indian cotton every year, with a value of more than 900 million Japanese yen, which can be regarded as the best market for our country's export of raw cotton. All efforts are needed, and prohibiting cotton watering and adulteration is also one of the efforts to be made. Fortunately, Mr. Liu Jisheng and Mr. Ye Yuanding are in charge of the director and deputy director of the office. The members of this committee have unlimited hope. On the day of the establishment of the office, on behalf of this committee, I pay tribute to Mr. Liu and Mr. Ye. (B) Director</p>
<h3 id="e133">Liu Weizhi's Reply <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Briefly said: Today, I am honored to be recommended by the Chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee to serve as the director of the Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office. Originally, I had no research on the cotton industry and did not dare to take on the job. However, this matter is not about being an official, but completely practical work. At the same time, I serve in the Ministry of Industry, so since I have been recommended by the Cotton Control Committee, I cannot refuse. Regarding the prohibition of cotton watering and adulteration, the Ministry of Industry has been implementing it for several years, but it is limited to the sales of the export department and has not yet been universally implemented in the production area. Recently, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry advocated that internal and external sales should be prohibited uniformly, which coincides with the purpose of this committee. Now that our country's cotton watering and adulteration prohibition work is handled in this way, we will definitely get good results in the future. Originally, prohibiting cotton watering and adulteration is a part of the work of controlling the cotton industry, which is very important. For the country to improve production, it will definitely get good results if it continues to be implemented for two years. Under the guidance of the Cotton Industry Control Committee and with the deputy director having a lot of experience in cotton production, I will naturally follow everyone's efforts and work hard.

As for the establishment of district branch offices and three offices in Yunzaobang, Beixinjing, and Dongjiadu in Shanghai City, they are currently under negotiation. For the sake of prudent personnel selection, after the decision of the personnel meeting, it is planned to extend the employment of more than 40 staff members from this office and the district branch offices in Jiangsu. As for the matters concerning adjudication in the functions of this office, for the purpose of pooling wisdom and benefiting from each other, it is planned to organize an advisory meeting, invite experts, discuss first, and then the office will make a fair judgment. This is the situation of being ordered to prepare. Now that this office is officially established, my talent is shallow, and I am deeply afraid of being overwhelmed. From now on, I will follow Director Liu and abide by the Cotton Industry Control Committee and work hard to eliminate the accumulated malpractices over the years. I hope that the sages present will give me advice from time to time, so as to avoid falling. I am extremely hopeful. (D)</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu's Speech Briefly said that the evil habit of watering and adulterating cotton has a history of several decades in our country. The cotton industry hates it and hopes to eradicate it completely as soon as possible. I am very happy that we can achieve this goal today. The prohibition regulations promulgated by the government this time are very broad in content and are quite suitable for implementation. The Ministry of Industry also attaches great importance to this matter, and specially appointed Vice Minister Liu to serve as the director of the Central Cotton Watering and Adulteration Prohibition Office. Deputy Director Ye is a cotton production expert, so it can be said that the laws and personnel are perfect, and the results of the future can be predicted from this.</p>
<h3 id="e135">All Chambers of Commerce Unanimously Oppose the Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Originally hoped to revise fair and simple methods</p>
<p>Do not heavily tax goods and involve trivial matters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the newly revised Stamp Tax Law of the Legislative Yuan violates the principles passed by the Central Political Council and has telegraphed to request correction. Yesterday, the chamber received a telegram from the Changsha Chamber of Commerce, also expressing opposition to the new Stamp Tax Law. The telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from Changsha Chamber of Commerce To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Recently, we sent a telegram to the President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Jun, stating that the draft Stamp Tax Law proposed by your Yuan stipulates that the tax rate for items such as invoices, account books, and receipts for amounts of three yuan or more to ten yuan is one cent, and one cent is added for every ten yuan thereafter. For items such as stocks, loan agreements, and contracts, the tax is two cents per hundred yuan. The tax on account books is two jiao per year, which is several times to hundreds of times higher than the tax rate in the current provisional regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. The draft bill changes the item-based tax on invoices and other items to a progressive tax, and the progressive level in the draft bill is also changed to one-thousandth. After reading it, we are deeply disturbed. The stamp tax was originally a certificate tax, and the tax rate should be determined based on the strength of the certificate's validity. To take the tax amount of invoices and other items as an example, it directly takes the amount of goods and silver as the standard, which is equivalent to taxing the goods heavily once. This type of certificate is very common in the business community and is not important. Such a regulation seems to contradict the purpose of the certificate tax. Moreover, industries are now in decline and taxes are overlapping. People still feel overwhelmed when paying taxes at the original amount. If it suddenly increases several times, how will they respond? The stamp tax was originally one of the good taxes in various countries, but since its implementation in our country at the end of the Qing Dynasty, more than 20 years ago, although the country's income from this item has increased year by year, the people are complaining. When asked about the hardships of the people, they all regard the stamp tax as the most serious form of harshness. The reason for this is that the staff handling tax affairs cannot be blameless, but the imperfection of the tax law itself is the biggest reason. In the past, the tax rate was divided into categories for the items that should be affixed with stamps, which was extremely trivial. Without thorough research, people often mistakenly fall into the legal net. In addition, the tax rate was inappropriate, and even unimportant certificates were subject to heavy taxes. Merchants in various places were troubled by harsh disturbances, so they repeatedly requested the central government to abolish the regulations and revise fair and simple methods. According to the report, the previous situation is extremely disappointing. We dare to telegraph to your Yuan, and earnestly request that you take into account the people's difficulties and allow the tax rate proposed in the draft bill to be specially reduced based on the current regulations, and another reduced method be formulated in order to be happy to follow and contribute to universalization. We are extremely anxious to await orders, etc. We hope that we will proceed together to the public good. Changsha Chamber of Commerce, Keng.</p>
<p>Reply telegram from Shanghai Chamber of Commerce To the Changsha Chamber of Commerce: We have received the Keng telegram. The Stamp Tax Law has been formally passed by the Yuan. Our chamber believes that it is inconsistent with the principles decided by the Central Political Council last year and has directly telegraphed to the Central Political Council to request correction by virtue of its authority. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Kou Yuan.</p>
<p>Telegram from the National Federation of Commerce The Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Lin Shihou, telegraphed the Nanjing Legislative Yuan yesterday, stating that (the title is omitted) the telegram from the Changsha Chamber of Commerce on the Geng day was received, stating (the original telegram is above), etc. With this, we found that the stamp tax passed by your association last year stipulates that those with certificates of validity or rights that are more important or used for a long time should be taxed heavily, and vice versa, taxed lightly. In addition, certificates with frequent behavior often adopt a simple and easy-to-implement fixed-amount tax, and certificates with rare behavior often adopt an easy-to-calculate progressive tax. For example, invoices, account books, receipts, etc., are actually certificates with less important rights, shorter use time, and frequent behavior. Now, although it has been changed to a tax of three yuan, it is calculated progressively, which is even more burdensome. I am afraid that it will be difficult to bear at a time when all industries are declining and business conditions are extremely difficult. It is reasonable to telegraph to your Yuan for verification and approval, and to earnestly request that you quickly reduce the tax in accordance with the principles established last year to facilitate implementation. Sincerely, the Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, Kou Shan.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Eighth Batch of Expelled Overseas Chinese From Japan Arrived Yesterday <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The ninth batch will also come to Shanghai today</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Agency, the eighth batch of expelled overseas Chinese from Japan, Jin Zuodun, Xu Chunlang, Lin Qingfa, and three others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the Japanese ship Ikomamaru from Moji. They stayed at the Yuelai Hotel on the Bund. A reporter from the New Sound Agency met with the overseas Chinese at the hotel yesterday and was told that they were all noodle vendors in Moji. Two months ago, the local police station detained them for no reason and searched them for 94.58 yuan. While in custody, they were subjected to inhuman treatment. They were put on the Ikomamaru to Shanghai a few days ago. However, the ship ticket from Moji to Shanghai only costs 19 yuan. When asked for the remaining funds, they were told that they could collect them from the shipowner after arriving in Shanghai. As a result, they arrived in Shanghai with empty pockets and were unable to collect anything from the shipowner. They originally planned to return to their hometown of Wenzhou, but they need money everywhere, and they cannot do anything without money. Their difficult situation is hard to describe. They deeply hope that the authorities will issue ship tickets and give them some travel expenses so that they will not be impoverished in Shanghai. It is also said that a ninth batch of overseas Chinese will arrive in Shanghai on the Tsukubamaru today.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Fuzhou Wharf Worker Strike: Shanghai Ships Stop Going to Taijiang <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Change to mooring at Mawei</p>
<p>Yongping Implemented Today</p>
<p>Shanghai to Fuzhou ships have always only gone as far as Mawei. Since the Fujian Provincial Department of Construction dredged the Min River, Shanghai-Fujian liners could directly reach Fuzhou's provincial capital and dock at Taijiang, saving cargo and passengers the trouble of transshipment. Unexpectedly, since Taijiang was opened to navigation, it has caused disputes and fights among dock workers in the two ports, and the situation is becoming increasingly extreme. Today, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Fuzhou liners have stopped going to Taijiang.</p>
<p>Cause of the Labor Dispute: Since Taijiang opened to navigation, regular Shanghai-Fujian liners, such as the China Merchants' Yong'an and Yongping, and the Sanpei's Wanxiang and Jing'an, no longer go to Mawei but instead go directly to Taijiang. Goods destined for Fujian and passengers traveling to Fujian used to be transported by small boats at Mawei, but now they no longer need to be transshipped. However, the dock workers in Mawei, who rely on loading and unloading goods for various commercial ships, now face a situation where hundreds of laborers have no means of livelihood. As a result, Mawei workers and all those traveling with the ships also moved to Taijiang to seek work, but were resisted by the local workers, leading to a major labor dispute.</p>
<p>Conflict Between the Two Sides: Last time the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Fujian liner Yongping arrived in Fuzhou, when it went from Mawei to Taijiang, the Mawei dock workers followed the ship to Nantai, seeking to occupy the loading and unloading work at the Taijiang dock. Unexpectedly, the local dock workers in Taijiang also had a labor union, and considering it a matter of their rights, they refused to allow the workers from Mawei to land and did not allow the Yongping ship to open its hatches and unload cargo. Neither side would give in, and the Taijiang workers organized a crowd to board the ship and engage in a major conflict with the Mawei workers. As a result, the cargo on the Yongping ship was blocked from being unloaded and had to return to Mawei, where the cargo was unloaded and stored in the Mawei warehouse.</p>
<p>Failed Mediation: After this incident, a major labor dispute arose, which not only disrupted public order but also caused stagnation in commercial transportation, which was of great concern. At that time, the Taijiang workers firmly refused to allow the Mawei workers to work in Taijiang, while the Mawei workers, concerned about their livelihood, were determined to follow the ships to Taijiang. The Taijiang labor union then issued a general strike order to deal with the situation. The matter was reported to the Party headquarters by both labor unions, requesting mediation. On the 8th of this month, the Party headquarters mediated and decided that the Taijiang workers would occupy two-thirds of the jobs, and the Mawei workers would occupy one-third. The Taijiang workers expressed satisfaction, but the Mawei workers were unwilling to accept, so the matter remained unresolved, and the labor dispute has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Suspension of Navigation to Taijiang: Yesterday, various shipping companies in this city received a telegram from Fuzhou stating that the workers in Taijiang and Mawei had not reached an understanding, the labor dispute had not ended, and the docks in Taijiang were still unable to load and unload cargo. Commercial ships going to Taijiang were likely to be obstructed. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yongping ship has decided not to go to Taijiang and will instead go to Mawei. Cargo destined for Fujian can only be unloaded in Mawei. Before the labor dispute is resolved, Shanghai-Fujian ships will temporarily abandon Nantai.</p>

<p>Effective October 15th</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Xinjiang, Ping-Guangdong, and Lanzhou-Ningxia routes have changed their flight schedules and abolished the Luoyang station, replacing it with Zhengzhou as a connecting station, effective yesterday. (1) The Shanghai-Xinjiang route's westbound flight departs from Shanghai every Wednesday at 7:10 AM and arrives in Lanzhou every Thursday at 11:30 AM. The eastbound flight departs from Lanzhou every Saturday at 2:00 PM and arrives in Shanghai every Sunday at 2:40 PM. The Lanzhou to Tacheng section has not yet been restored. (2) The Ping-Guangdong route's southbound flight departs from Ping every Sunday and Wednesday at 7:50 AM and arrives in Guangdong every Monday and Thursday at 1:20 PM. The northbound flight departs from Guangdong every Saturday and Tuesday at 10:30 AM and arrives in Ping every Sunday and Wednesday at 4:10 PM. (3) The Lanzhou-Baotou route's northbound flight departs every Thursday from Baotou to Lanzhou, and the southbound flight departs every Friday from Lanzhou to Baotou. However, the Baotou airport still needs repairs, so the route only goes as far as Ningxia. It is estimated that the entire route will be open to navigation around the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications yesterday approved a telegram from Xu Naiguang, chairman of the Zhejiang Shipping Association in Shanghai, stating that according to a letter from Wu Fengfei, manager of the Xu Shenxing sailboat, on October 10th, he loaded 32 round wooden fir barrels from the Zhenchang Lumber Company to be sent to the Dangtu Railway Station. He hired the Hengda New Steamship to go to Wusong together with the Yiyongli sailboat to export the goods. However, when towed to the Jiangmian area of Waigaoqiao in Yangshupu, around 7:30 PM, the Datongxing Company's Tongsheng ship suddenly entered the port at full speed and violently crashed into the Xu Shenxing sailboat from right to left, cutting the hull into three sections, and all the fir was submerged. The total loss, excluding the fir, was estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. The crew members who fell into the water were fortunate to cling to the fir and avoid drowning. They are currently being treated at Shanghai Hospital. After the Tongsheng ship caused the accident, it did not provide assistance and continued to sail. The Gaoqiao branch of the water patrol team heard the alarm and rushed to the scene on the Hengda New Steamship and learned the name of the ship and its affiliated company. The tugboat Hengda New, its driver Chen Sanmao, Xu Shenxing's crew member Yu Peiming, and Yiyonghe's crew member Chen Jiagen were detained for interrogation. It is earnestly requested that your association, considering that one ship supports ten families, that is, dozens of elderly and young people, for their livelihood, promptly submit to the competent authorities to order full compensation and severely punish the drivers who caused the accident. Therefore, this special report is submitted to your bureau for prompt review. After receiving the letter, the Shipping Administration Bureau has contacted the Wusong Fourth Detachment of the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Jianghai Customs to investigate the truth of the incident for review.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Opening of the Third Session of the Freight Transport Training Course on Two Railways <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration is holding a freight transport training course to promote cooperation between production, transportation, and sales. The second session of the training course was completed the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the third session of the training course began, with more than 40 trainees from various banks and factories. Director Wu of the bureau personally delivered a speech yesterday. The following is a transcript of his speech: The freight transport training course organized by this bureau originated from the production, transportation, and sales cooperation promoted by this railway. According to the "Outline of Cooperation Methods for Production, Transportation, and Sales at Various Stations along the Line" formulated by this railway, Article 5, "Matters in which this railway engages in cooperation," includes the third item, "Assigning personnel to guide or handle transportation procedures on behalf of places with large-scale production and sales of goods." Now, we are piloting this in Shanghai, and various companies and factories have participated one after another. This is already the third session, which is truly a good sign of cooperation. In this third session, more than ten participants are representatives from various banks. Although the banking industry is not in any of the production, transportation, and sales sectors, the banking industry's handling of import and export bills, warehousing, and other circulation financial facilities are all important and closely related to the production, transportation, and sales sectors, so we feel particularly gratified. Now, I will briefly report on what this railway hopes for. (1) One prerequisite for cooperation is "consistency." All parties participating in cooperation must move towards the same goal, and then great effectiveness can occur. Otherwise, they will be going in opposite directions, and their forces will cancel each other out, or even cause danger. For example, using two locomotives to drive a train, if they are traveling in the same direction, of course, they can increase speed or pulling force. But if they are hung on both ends of a train, one moving forward and the other moving backward, not only will it not move, but it will also cause trouble. Speaking of the production, transportation, and sales cooperation promoted by this railway, broadly speaking, serving society is consistent, and narrowly speaking, seeking to handle matters quickly is also consistent, and seeking to eliminate waste is also consistent. Only under such consistency can there be cooperation. Now, this railway is handling freight transport training from the position of transportation, and the production and sales parties are all participating. This is proof of cooperation. (2) One principle of cooperation is "mutual benefit." Sharing benefits with each other is cooperation. If you rob me and I snatch from you, it becomes competition. Therefore, all parties participating in cooperation must be able to take care of each other's interests and must not be greedy for more benefits for themselves and cause others to suffer losses. For example, this railway is now handling freight transport training, on the one hand, to enable various companies and factories to thoroughly understand the procedures for consigning goods on the railway and then handle the procedures in accordance with the regulations, pay freight at the prescribed rates, save a lot of trouble, and avoid many errors. On the other hand, this railway can also save various explanations when accepting consignment goods and instruct everyone. Saving time is everyone getting benefits. (3) One element of cooperation is "mutual understanding." The so-called knowing the other and knowing yourself, all parties participating in cooperation must have this spirit. For example, this railway is now handling freight transport training, which is telling all its methods to the production and sales parties from the transportation side. The production and sales parties can be said to already know the other. But this railway also needs to know the other, so it also hopes that the production and sales parties, that is, those who are currently participating in the training, will express their opinions on our methods of handling freight transport at any time for reference. Speaking of this point, people can probably be divided into three types. One type is that they do not know themselves, so naturally they have nothing to tell others. Another type is that although they know, they are not willing to tell others, and then they can keep others guessing or have various tricks. There is also a type that although they know, they think it is insignificant and do not need to tell others. Our production, transportation, and sales parties are certainly not the first type of people, but we must not be the last two types of people, and then everyone can be without barriers, and the spirit of cooperation can be even more thoroughly implemented. Finally, there is one more point to say, which is that cooperation must be continuous and must be permanent. Otherwise, if cooperation is cancelled today, it will be ineffective. Therefore, from the perspective of production, transportation, and sales cooperation, after the end of this freight transport training, this railway also hopes that the production and sales parties will have an organization to serve as a hub for constant contact with this railway, that is, permanent cooperation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1169 yesterday, stating: It is verified that letters must not contain letters, notes, or other documents addressed to anyone other than the addressee or anyone living with the addressee. Furthermore, senders must not intentionally mail items abroad or have them mailed abroad, as clearly stipulated in Article 21 of the Postal Regulations and Article 3 of the Final Protocol of the London International Postal Convention. However, it has been found that letters mailed from China to Dalian or Japan have repeatedly been found to contain foreign postage stamps attached, taking the route of Siberia to mail items to Europe. This not only infringes on China's postal rights but also violates the United Postal Regulations and should be stopped immediately. In the future, letters mailed to Dalian or Japan should be opened and inspected by the sender if their circumstances are suspicious before acceptance. If the aforementioned circumstances are found, the sender should immediately pay supplementary postage and affix Chinese postage stamps for direct mailing to the destination. All are hereby notified.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Court Ruling</p>
<p>After the death of the late dye king Xue Baorun, he left behind assets of no less than 10 million yuan. Xue also owned the majority of shares in the Yongjirun and Baokangrun qianzhuang in Wuxi, which were inherited by his four sons, Xue Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gengsheng. However, due to the extravagance of Gansheng and others, their lavish spending, and their lack of business acumen, the Yongjirun and Baokangrun qianzhuang went bankrupt one after another last year, owing 377,902.97 yuan to 14 households, including the Yongfengzhuang, Yongshengzhuang, Shunkangzhuang, and Yongyuanzhuang, which had dealings with Suzhou. Recently, because the Zhuang and others repeatedly demanded payment from the heirs, the four sons of Xue, but were ignored, they hired two lawyers, Lu Hongyi and others, to file a lawsuit against the four Xue brothers in the Civil Court of the First Special Court for non-payment of debts. The Special Court has held two trials and has now concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the presiding judge Qiao Wanxuan announced the verdict in Civil Court No. 7, stating that Xue Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gengsheng should jointly repay the amount claimed by Yongfengzhuang and others, along with interest, and bear the costs of the case.</p>

<p>The suicide note stated that he committed suicide due to lack of money for medical treatment.</p>
<p>At the Daxing Small Inn at No. 41 Wuhu Road in Mantingfang, Wumalu, around 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, a traveler arrived, claiming to be Li Xingfu, 30 years old, from Shandong Province. The waiter led him to room 14. Around 1:00 AM that night, he had the thought of ending his life and secretly took raw opium to commit suicide. He was discovered by someone and rushed to Renji Hospital, but it was too late, and he died around 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon. Afterwards, two suicide notes prepared in advance were found, one addressed to Yu Jingwei of Tongxinglou, Simalu, and the other to his parents and father-in-law in his hometown, stating that he had been suffering from illness for a long time and could not continue medical treatment, so he took this extreme measure.</p>

<p>Around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, a man wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, about 40 years old, was walking through the intersection of Danshui Road and Chengdu Road when a car with license plate number 12076 came speeding by. The man could not avoid it and was knocked to the ground, suffering a head injury. Hua Pu, number 639, saw it and rushed the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injury, the treatment was ineffective, and he died around 5:30 PM. He was transferred to the morgue for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Fire on Avenue Edward VII Yesterday Morning: As Many as Fourteen People Burned to Death <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>One of them was a pregnant woman, so the total is 15 people.</p>
<p>Most of the corpses were unrecognizable, and only nine people's names were found.</p>
<p>A fire broke out on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession around 4:20 AM yesterday morning. Due to the late discovery, 14 men and women were burned to death and seven people were burned, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. The details are described below.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Packed to the Gills <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>No. 384 East of the Avenue Edward VII Small Vegetable Market is a single-family city house that was rented by Ni Lingsheng to open Ni Shunxing Cotton Shop. The downstairs was used as a shop front, and the other areas, such as the back building, the pavilion room, the second-floor mezzanine, and the kitchen, were divided into seven rooms by Ni Lingsheng and sublet to others. As a result, the single house, including the cotton shop, was occupied by as many as eight families, which can be described as packed to the gills. The neighbor to the left is No. 382, where Yin Deyu opened the Tongchunxiang Candy Shop, and the neighbor to the right is No. 386, where Li Aqing opened the Li Wanli Fruit Shop.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Sudden Fire Alarm <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, around 4:20 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the cotton pile in the cotton shop's shop front. The tenants in each room were sound asleep, so they did not notice it. As a result, a small fire became a prairie fire. White smoke filled the air, and then the fire spread to the floorboards and upstairs. The tenants upstairs were still sound asleep until the fire was imminent and broke through the roof, spreading to the floors of the neighboring buildings on the left and right. Neighbors shouted and woke them up from their dreams. They tried to escape in a panic, but the ladder had already been burned down, and they were disoriented by the smoke and fire, and fainted one after another. As a result, none of the tenants upstairs escaped, and the shop owner Ni Lingsheng and the shop assistants barely escaped with their lives.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Cries Shook the Sky <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, the neighbors and shop assistants in the surrounding shops were also awakened. Seeing that the fire was out of control, they cried for help and reported to the fire department. The Hongkou and Central fire departments received the news and rushed four fire trucks to put out the fire. But it was already 4:49 AM, and the fire was still raging. Cries of anguish shook the heavens and the earth in the fire pit. The firefighters saw the critical situation and courageously rescued people by raising ladders. While rescuing eight men, women, and children, the floor collapsed downwards. As a result, three men, one boy, three girls, and seven women were all buried in the fire pit, and it was learned that two of the women were pregnant.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Injured Were Sent to the Hospital <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>It was not until dawn, at 5:35 AM, that the fire gradually died down. The Ni Shunxing Cotton Shop turned into a scorched earth. The floors of the Tongchunxiang and Li Wanli shops were also completely burned down. The firefighters rushed the men who were burned, Ma Shougui, a 24-year-old man from Wuxi, Chen Wencai, a 42-year-old man from Ningbo, and Jiang Yongfa, a 40-year-old man from Changzhou, to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Jiang Yongfa's wife, Pan, 40 years old, was sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Two girls, Shi Erbao, 11 years old, Shi Sanbao, 7 years old, and Shi Shen, were also sent to the Shanghai Sanitarium Branch on Bazilu for treatment. Only Shi Shen suffered minor injuries and was discharged immediately. The rest were in critical condition.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Investigation of the Deceased <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>All fourteen male and female corpses that were burned to death were found in the rubble by firefighters after 6 AM. They were shaped like charred wood and had a strange and unpleasant odor. For a time, onlookers gathered, and they were crowded and unable to move. Everyone sighed that the relevant exchange office police station should send a large number of detectives to suppress them. On one hand, they started investigating the names of the corpses. After half a day of investigation, they only found nine people: (1) Zhou Maosheng, (2) Zhou Caichen, (3) Hu Guisheng, (4) Shi Xu, (5) Wang Hong, (6) Zhou Jiang, (7) Jiang Azhen, (8) Jiang Axiang, and (9) Jiang Amao. They used a car to send the corpses to the morgue to request the court to examine them. On one hand, they investigated the cause of the fire and detained the shop owner Ni Lingsheng for further investigation. However, according to neighbors, it was feared that it was caused by a cigarette butt left in the cotton pile. In addition, the weather suddenly turned cold last night, and everyone was sound asleep. At the same time, the discovery was delayed, resulting in this disaster, which is also very tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e155">After the North Wind Howled, the Weather Suddenly Turned Cold Yesterday Morning; The Hurricane Was Still Far from Shanghai <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>

In the morning, there was light rain. Pedestrians had to wear padded clothes. According to a report from the local observatory, the highest temperature yesterday was 60.3 degrees, and the lowest was 55.8 degrees. As for the Pacific hurricane, the observatory received a report at 2 PM, which was located at 14 degrees north latitude and 126 degrees east longitude, approximately east of Luzon.

<h3 id="e156">Englishman Killed in Car Accident <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>First Hit a Pedestrian, Then He Also Fell Out of the Car and Suffered Serious Injuries</p>
<p>The injured pedestrian did not die, but the driver died of serious injuries.</p>
<p>An Englishman, a Scotsman named McDougall, came to Shanghai from England three months ago and worked in the accounting department of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company. He lived at No. 14, Lane 188, Avenue Albert in the French Concession. Because the journey was long and inconvenient, he bought a motorcycle for transportation. Its number was 2018. Around 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, Dugal was driving his car east of Jing'an Temple Road, Carter Road, and west of Tongfu Road, from east to west. At that time, Du Decheng, a native of Yangzhou, who was the director of the cashier's department of the Wuxi Zhongnan Bank, also known as Du Shangzhai, 50 years old, crossed the road, causing the Westerner to be unable to avoid it in time. The man and the car collided. Du Decheng was knocked down, and his head and legs were injured. The Westerner also fell from the car due to the sudden stop, and his head was severely injured, with blood gushing out. Yin Pu, number 1225, who was on duty at the station, saw it and sent the injured Westerner to Hong'en Hospital, and Du Decheng was sent to the Red Cross on Hague Road for treatment. However, the Westerner Dugal died shortly after due to his serious injuries. Afterwards, the Xinzha Police Station immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to conduct a detailed investigation. Du Decheng was indeed negligent in this case, so yesterday morning, the police station took him from the hospital and sent him to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special Court, requesting permission to detain him for investigation in accordance with Article 49 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Du Decheng hired lawyer E Sen to defend him in court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that when the accident occurred, the Westerner Neil, Webber, and Yin Pu, number 325, witnessed it. According to the two Westerners' statements to Yin Pu, the fault in this case lies entirely with Du Decheng, because he did not pay attention to the passing vehicles at the time and suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, resulting in the accident. Now, permission is requested to temporarily detain Du because the victimized Westerner will be sent to Hong'en Hospital by the British Consulate this afternoon for an examination, and Du must also be brought to the case for questioning. Yin Pu, number 325, testified, "I was on duty at that place yesterday. When the accident happened, I raised my hand to stop north-south traffic and allow east-west vehicles to pass. The Westerner's motorcycle was the last vehicle, traveling from east to west. At that time, the petitioner suddenly rushed out from the south and walked north, crossing the road. Because he did not pay attention to the vehicles in the road and was only a foot away from the Westerner's car, he could not avoid it, and the motorcycle crashed into Du's body and fell to the ground. The Westerner also fell from the car due to the urgency of stopping the car." Du Decheng confessed, "I have been the director of the cashier's department of the Wuxi Zhongnan Bank. I came to Shanghai this time on the 13th of this month from Jiangbei and stayed at the Kaitai Hotel on Tianjin Road. Yesterday afternoon, when I was returning from visiting friends on Weihaiwei Road, I passed through the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. This road is a north-south straight road. I was crossing the road from west to east. At that time, there were very few vehicles passing by, and I did not see the Indian raising his hand to stop me. When I was about to reach the pedestrian road opposite, the Westerner's motorcycle suddenly drove from the front. Because his car was traveling too fast and I did not hear the horn, I was hit head-on, injuring my head and legs. The Westerner also fell from the car," Lawyer E Sen argued that according to today's court hearing, Du Decheng was not at fault, and he himself was seriously injured and urgently needed medical treatment. He cannot be detained for no reason and suffer. Therefore, he requested permission to post bail for medical treatment. Judge Liu Yugui examined the confession and ordered that the case be adjourned, and Du Decheng was allowed to post a 500-yuan bail and be responsible for appearing whenever summoned for questioning.</p>

<p>Letter to D. Delfs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Tong Ren He Dye Shop, located at No. 80, Rue de la République, French Concession, being accused of trademark infringement by D. Delfs &amp; Co., as reported in this newspaper, the shop has since negotiated with D. Delfs &amp; Co. The company has acknowledged the misunderstanding and has stated in a letter that they are taking steps to withdraw the accusation. However, Xu Chengdong, the manager of Tong Ren He, felt unjustly accused and complained to the Shanghai West Face Dye Industry Guild, requesting assistance. The guild convened a general meeting of all members, discussed the matter, and resolved to send a letter to D. Delfs &amp; Co., urging them to follow through on their letter and take responsibility for withdrawing the accusation. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: According to our member, Tong Ren He Dye Shop, we have a contract to distribute D. Delfs &amp; Co.'s "Candle Red" with the six-tael "Longevity Star" trademark. We have also registered the use of the "Longevity Star" trademark with the Trademark Bureau. The back of the can features a red candle, symbolizing that the raw material is used for candle red. Unexpectedly, D. Delfs &amp; Co. nitpicked and hastily claimed that we were imitating their "Three Stars" trademark. They falsely reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to search our shop. Under the guidance of a Westerner from D. Delfs &amp; Co., they ransacked the place and forbade us from making any noise. It was later found that the "Longevity Star Candle Red" sold by our shop was all original goods under the distribution contract signed with D. Delfs &amp; Co. The truth came to light, and they admitted their mistake, stating in a letter that they "have taken steps to withdraw the accusation from the police." However, our shop's business reputation has suffered greatly. If justice is not upheld in this matter, the consequences will be unimaginable. We request that you provide the original letter from D. Delfs &amp; Co. to the guild. Based on this, whether or not there is trademark infringement depends on whether the goods distributed under the signed contract are counterfeit. Now that it has been verified that they are original goods, there is no apparent act of counterfeiting. They have admitted their mistake and have taken steps to withdraw the accusation, which we now understand. Given these circumstances, the actions taken by your company beforehand were too rash and have aroused resentment among our industry colleagues. Since this case is a public prosecution, it falls under the jurisdiction of the police. Since your company has stated that it will take steps to withdraw the accusation, you should take responsibility for handling the matter. Furthermore, many of our guild members are long-standing customers of your company in China, and the basic business dealings are a direct benefit. However, you often make a mountain out of a molehill on minor trademark issues, disregarding your business relationships and antagonizing your customers. This attitude is extremely detrimental to maintaining business relations and should be avoided. This case was brought up for discussion at the members' meeting on the ninth of this month, and it was decided that "D. Delfs &amp; Co. should be more careful in the future regarding the trademarks used by our colleagues to avoid disputes and damage to business relations, and a letter of advice should be sent." Accordingly, we hereby inform you that in the future, when trademark issues arise with our colleagues, you must be careful to avoid harming business relationships. We hope for your prompt reply. Sincerely, The Shanghai West Face Dye Industry Guild.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Modern Wife Sues <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Unwilling to Live with Old-fashioned Parents-in-Law</p>
<p>The Court Has Already Attempted Mediation Twice</p>
<p>Tu Guiliang, a native of Ningbo, is 28 years old and a graduate of the YMCA school of St. John's University. His father, Tu Yonggui, is nearly sixty and runs the Xingchang Foreign Goods Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road. In 1926, through a matchmaker, he married Dai Miaozhen, a graduate of the McTyeire School for Girls, whose father, Dai Ziming, was a leather goods merchant (now deceased). Since their marriage, Tu and Dai have had a good relationship and have two sons and four daughters. The fourth boy died young; the rest are still living. The family lives on the third floor of the Xingchang store, where Tu's parents also reside. Tu Yonggui provides his daughter-in-law with a monthly allowance of fifty yuan. However, Dai is a so-called "modern woman" who dresses fashionably and has extensive social contacts, frequenting dance halls, theaters, and other entertainment venues. In the summer, she is particularly fond of swimming. The Tu family is entirely old-fashioned. Her parents-in-law disapproved of their daughter-in-law going to dance halls and swimming pools, and swimming and dancing with men, considering it improper. They tried to stop her, but Dai believed that these were legitimate social activities and that as long as there was no inappropriate behavior, no one could stop her. This led to frequent arguments. On August 27th of this year, a conflict arose which led to physical violence, and they ended up fighting at the police station. Tu Guiliang mediated to prevent a lawsuit, and they returned home together. However, on September 11th, Dai Miaozhen took one daughter, along with her jewelry, and left without returning. She also hired attorney Jiang Yiping to send a letter to Tu, requesting to live separately from her parents-in-law and attaching various conditions. After receiving the letter, Tu hired attorney Chen Chou to file a petition with the mediation office of the First Special District Court, requesting a summons for mediation to live together and to bring back the eldest daughter, Yuanyuan, and the gold jewelry and clothing that had been taken away. At the same time, Dai also hired attorney Jiang to file a petition for mediation to live with her husband but separately from her parents-in-law. One mediation had already been held. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao Dejun held another hearing for mediation. According to attorney Chen, the female side requested 400-500 yuan per month for living expenses after separation, and that a large sum of money be prepared as a security deposit for living expenses, guaranteeing at least two years' worth of expenses. She also required that the gold jewelry that had been pawned be redeemed. However, Tu Guiliang's financial power was entirely in his father's hands, and due to the decline in business, it was impossible to afford it. At most, he could pay 100 yuan per month for living expenses after separation and hoped that the woman could return home to live together. The female side stated that the minimum requirement was 200 yuan per month. The court immediately mediated with a compromise of 150 yuan, but both sides were unwilling to agree and requested a postponement to persuade each other further to avoid going to extremes. The court approved the request and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

Police attorney Qian Xunjiu stated the facts of the case and prosecuted them for gambling. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, Yang Dengke was sentenced to four months in prison and fined 100 yuan.

The situation of orphanage education in various provinces and branches has been reported at the meeting. He always had a good relationship with the representatives in promoting orphanage work. He regretted being unable to attend due to illness. However, the results of the meeting showed that everyone was committed to promoting the progress of orphanage work and had a complete plan, like kind fathers and mothers of the children. The society members deeply admired this. He hoped that everyone would provide guidance to the society at any time and would cooperate in material and spiritual matters in the future. He toasted to everyone's health. President Zhang Lanping then gave a speech, stating that all countries in the world are now committed to war preparations, and a deadly atmosphere fills the earth. The work of managing orphanages is to seek the way of life, nurture, and education, to seek a glimmer of hope in the midst of death. He hoped that everyone would work together to promote the way of life, awaken the spirit of mutual assistance and love among mankind, and eliminate the ominous atmosphere of death in the world. The leaders jointly elected Chen Peide, representative of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, and Chen Tiesheng, Director-General of the China Orphanage Association, to give speeches expressing their gratitude. The banquet ended at 8 PM with the guests and hosts in good spirits. During the banquet, Tao, a representative of the Fuyu Industrial and Children's Hospital, reported on the progress of the hospital, which has now raised more than 1,000 children. He hoped that the representatives would visit the hospital on Yulin Road for guidance. More than 80 people signed up on the spot and were scheduled to visit at 9 AM the next day.</p>

<p>Ms. Xiong Zhi (i.e., Mrs. Zhu Junfu), the eldest daughter of Mr. Xiong Xiling, director of the Xiangshan Orphanage in Beiping, is from Fenghuang, Hunan. She holds a master's degree from the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States. After returning to China, she assisted her father in running the family department of the first school of the Xiangshan Orphanage, which included the Zhu Junfu and Xiong Zhi couple and their children, the nanny training class, the nursery, and the kindergarten. She also served as the vice president of the Beiping Kindergarten Normal School, the director of the Beiping Zhaohui Kindergarten, and the director of the Tianjin Zhaohui Kindergarten. On the tenth of this month, she accompanied her father to Shanghai to attend the National Orphanage Leaders Conference, where she made many suggestions and plans, showing the brilliance of her father. She is truly an outstanding talent in the modern Chinese orphanage world. The "Modern Parents Monthly" of this port hosted a banquet for Ms. Xiong yesterday (the 15th) at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road to express the greatest respect, as Ms. Xiong is not only a pioneer in the Chinese orphanage world but also a special contributor to the "Modern Parents" and has spared no effort in maintaining and supporting it.

<p>Feng Zhiqing, 31 years old, from Nanjing, has been working as an inspector on the third floor of the Sichuan Road, Baidu Bridge Post Office. He is known for his conscientiousness in his work, which has led to resentment from criminals. Unexpectedly, at around 4:05 AM yesterday morning, while Feng was sleeping soundly in the inspector's room, a thug suddenly came and struck Feng's head with an axe. When Feng woke up in pain and called for help, his fellow police officers arrived, but the assailant had disappeared. Feng was taken to Renji Hospital by inspector Wen Zhong for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are very serious and his life is in danger. Feng previously served as an inspector at the Third Sub-station of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and was transferred to his current position on August 20, 1932.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Fake Recruitment Employs Copper Medals to Collect Money, Large Numbers of Coolies Deceived <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>At around 10 PM the night before, Gao Minglong, a police officer at the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Xinzha Public Security Bureau, brought Xu Yuanji to the station after being apprehended by Shen Xintai. Shen Xintai accused Xu Yuanji, 36 years old, from Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province, currently residing at No. 58 Zhangjiabang, Jumen Road, Nanshi, and working as a carpenter, of falsely claiming that someone had invested a large sum of money to contract a mine in Dongyang and Yiwu counties in Zhejiang Province and was in urgent need of excavation. Therefore, he was sent to Shanghai to recruit a large number of miners. Anyone willing to work must obtain a copper medal (the copper medal is shaped like a large copper coin with the words "Dong Cheng" cast on it). Each medal costs three yuan. After obtaining the copper medal, one can go to the mining site to report for work. Therefore, many people signed up for the job. The individual was subcontracted to recruit workers by Xu and was defrauded of more than 900 yuan. Later, Xu disappeared without a trace. He was spotted on Yongxing Road, Yuyingtang Road, the other night and was taken into custody. Xu Yuanji confessed that he was 41 years old, from Yuyao, had no fixed address, and (46 remaining copper medals were found on his body). In November of the lunar calendar last year, a man named Jin Meilan came to Shanghai with him to contract the recruitment of workers. Unexpectedly, the mining failed, and Shen Xintai was also a subcontracted labor contractor. He owed Shen more than 400 yuan, so he took him into custody today. He admitted that he issued all the copper medals. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, he ordered the case to be submitted to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau Zhabei Branch and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation on suspicion of fraud.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Ministry of Finance's Increase in Silver Export Tax <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Shao-de</p>
<p>The issue of rising silver prices has become increasingly acute since the passage of the U.S. Silver Purchase Act in June of this year. The London and New York silver markets have gradually strengthened since June 22. By early July, the average London silver market had increased by one and a half pence per ounce, and the New York silver market had risen from around 45 cents to over 46 cents. Observe the table below:</p>
<p>Date London Silver Market New York Silver Market</p>

<p>29th 21 and 1/8 46 and 1/4</p>
<p>30th 21 46 and 1/4</p>
<p>Since July, the London silver market has generally remained around 21 pence. At the same time, the Shanghai foreign exchange rates quoted for London were also lower than the silver parity between London and Shanghai. In the past, the extent of the discount was very limited, at most 0.125 or 0.25 pence lower than the Sino-British exchange rate parity. Now, the extent of the discount is becoming more and more severe. For example, on August 1, the Sino-British parity should have been 17.125 pence, but the HSBC quote was only 16 pence, a discount of as much as 1.125 pence. On August 21, the difference was even greater, reaching 1.875 pence. As such, on August 21, the Shanghai market could purchase one yuan for only one shilling, four pence, and three-seventy-five. If it were sold in the London market on the same day, one could obtain one shilling, six pence, and two-five of British currency. In one transaction, a profit of 1.875 pence could be made per Shanghai silver dollar. In other words, buying and selling 100 million silver dollars could yield a profit of 187,500,000 pence, which, at the value of that time, could yield a profit of about 11 million yuan. No wonder there has been a large outflow of silver from Shanghai in the past two months. At the end of July this year, Shanghai's silver reserves were 530,402,000 yuan. By the end of August, they had dropped to 483,740,000 yuan. By the end of September, they had changed to 445,363,000 yuan. Since October, the amount of silver flowing out of Shanghai in two weeks has reached 26,850,000 yuan. Therefore, since the U.S. Silver Purchase Act was approved by the U.S. President on June 20, the silver market has been trending stronger. After the U.S. announced its silver nationalization policy on August 9, the situation took a turn for the worse. Last week, the London silver market even rose to 24 pence per ounce. For example, on October 14, the near-term price was 24 pence, 4375, and the forward price was 24 pence, 5625. Accordingly, the Shanghai-London foreign exchange parity should be one shilling, eight pence, and 5625. However, on that day, the Central Bank's quoted London telegraphic transfer rate was one shilling, six pence, and one-two-five, while HSBC's quoted rate was only one shilling and six pence. Even when calculating the forward rate, the quoted price was still very different from the parity. Therefore, from the various technical points mentioned above, the outflow of silver from our country is unavoidable. At such a critical juncture, the government should adopt no more than two main policies: first, directly declare a ban on silver exports; second, levy a silver export tax to reduce the difference in silver speculation profits. However, for our country, which is a silver standard country, the former is tantamount to directly abandoning half of the silver standard. Regarding the various financial measures after the prohibition of silver exports, given our environmental circumstances, we may not be allowed. Therefore, we can only take the second method of levying a silver export tax. In the past, the silver export tax was only 2.5%. However, according to our calculations, the difference between the London silver market and Shanghai silver prices has been about 10% in the past two months. As such, after deducting 2.5% for transportation costs, 2.5% for tariffs, there is still a profit of about 5% for shipping silver from Shanghai to London. As of the last two weeks of this month, the London silver market has been even stronger, and the profit from shipping silver from Shanghai to London has also increased compared to the past. Therefore, silver exports have also been unleashed and cannot be stopped. The Ministry of Finance formally announced yesterday morning (the 15th) that it would raise the silver export tax to 10%, which is appropriate. Its regulations for determining the silver export tax rate are as follows: (1) Silver standard currency will be subject to an export tax of 10%, deducting the minting fee of 2.25%, resulting in a net tax of 7.75%. (2) Large bars of treasure silver and other types of silver will be subject to an additional tax of 7.75%, combined with the original 2.5%, for a total of 10%. (3) If the London silver price converted to the Shanghai exchange rate differs from the exchange rate determined by the Central Bank on that day, and the amount is still insufficient after paying the above export tax, a balancing tax should be levied according to the insufficient amount. At the same time, the Central Bank also announced that "Starting from October 15 of this year, this bank will comply with the government's instructions on levying taxes on silver exports and will determine the market price of all calculated differences between the London silver price and the Shanghai telegraphic transfer to London in shillings at 11:30 a.m. every business day and notify the customs so that they can calculate accordingly." As such, based on the parity and foreign exchange rates between Shanghai and London in recent days, the 75% tax rate will reduce the speculation of transporting silver to London or New York. At the same time, the so-called balancing tax will be levied to stop the practice of transporting silver for profit based on price differences. Given the environment in which our country finds itself today, the strategy adopted for the outflow of silver in all financial organizations is appropriate. Finance Minister Kong's two major financial measures recently are: first, to prohibit the speculation of gold standard, so that the settlement price of gold standard will be based on the customs silver price of the Central Bank, so that the sovereignty of the settlement price of the largest gold standard market in the Far East will not depend on the foreign exchange market, but will consolidate its barriers; second, to resolutely increase the silver export tax and restrict the speculative export of silver, which is of great importance to the stability of our country's finance. Consolidating the financial foundation and striving for the development of the national economy are appropriate measures.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Awakening of National Self-Reliance and Revival (Part 3) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Draft by Zhang Yuan-ruo</p>
<p>丨At the Chinese Vocational Education Society 丨</p>
<p>7.  Comparison of Self-Reliance and Various Doctrines. A detailed and specialized study should be conducted separately to compare self-reliance and various doctrines. Here, the most superficial method will be used for explanation.</p>
<p>(1) Comparison of Self-Reliance and Liberalism丨Liberalism is based on rights, while self-reliance is based on duties and responsibilities. In the West, property rights are called freedom of property. In law, whatever is freedom is the meaning of rights. Self-reliance is anti-freedom and does not advocate that an individual takes rights too seriously. My legal thought is based on obligations (see my "Modern Constitutionalism," Zhonghua, and "Outline of Modern Legal System," Commercial Press). Therefore, the spirit of my self-reliance is also consistent. (2) Comparison of Individualism and Self-Reliance丨Individualism also has its advantages and disadvantages. Greek thought advocates self-awareness, which is an advantage of individualism. Now, because it is too permissive, it has developed serious morbidities. Self-reliance is produced to correct this morbidity. (3) Comparison of Self-Reliance and Socialism丨Self-reliance differs from extreme socialism in that socialism obliterates individuality. Everything is social, and there is no development of individuality. In the past, Russia practiced extreme socialism, and as a result, individuality could not develop, industry stagnated, and production decreased. Therefore, it changed to the New Economic Policy. Although self-reliance advocates that society and the country are the foundation, it also emphasizes self-awareness. The development of extreme socialism should also be corrected. (4) Comparison of Self-Reliance and Democracy丨The characteristic of democracy lies in the average development of national individuality. It does not mean that a republic with a parliament can be called a democratic country. The characteristic of democracy can be said to be the same as self-reliance, because self-reliance also wants to enable each citizen to develop his or her strengths. However, the difference is that democracy is based on liberalism, and self-reliance does not allow individuals to have absolute freedom. One must be able to fulfill one's obligations to the state and society before one can enjoy freedom. (5) Comparison of Self-Reliance and Fascism丨Fascism is a kind of activism. I sympathize with this point, because in real time and space, everything should be done vigorously. However, my self-reliance is the way of the king, and it differs from the spirit of fascism. (6) Comparison of Self-Reliance and Soldarisme丨Soldarisme calls for Soldarisme. My brother believes very much in this doctrine. The foundation of my brother's legal studies is completely built on Soldarisme. It divides society into two phenomena and has two kinds of relationships at the same time: (A) Seeking simultaneous social solidarity: Solidarite Por Similitude; (B) Social solidarity of division of labor: Solidarite por Division du tirvtal. The observation of social phenomena is not biased towards the individual, nor is it biased towards society, but is just right, like the doctrine of Confucius. In the social relationship of seeking common ground, we should work hard for society. In the social relationship of division of labor, we should do our best, develop our strengths, and be loyal to our duties. Therefore, Soldarisme can be said to be the middle way to adjust the two thoughts of individual liberalism and extreme socialism. Although self-reliance cannot be said to be absolutely the same as it, in terms of the spirit of thought, it can be said to be consistent with each other.</p>
<p>8.  Advantages and Functions of Self-Reliance. Where are the advantages of self-reliance, and what are its uses? We can see from the comparison of self-reliance with various doctrines that it eliminates the shortcomings of each doctrine and has the advantages of each doctrine. It is not speculative, and at the same time, it does not surrender to any faction of thought. It takes the strengths of various philosophical thoughts and abandons their shortcomings. Therefore, self-reliance can be said to be the culmination of various doctrines and various philosophical thoughts, and can be regarded as the most perfect doctrine in modern times. Self-reliance is so good in theory, but is it consistent with the current society? There are many morbidities in Chinese society today, and the reason why self-reliance is so valuable is that it can correct these many morbidities one by one. For example, the diseases of the Chinese people lie in empty talk, vanity, opportunism, luck, blaming others, dependence, laziness, inertia, fear of difficulty, complacency, baseness, power struggles, selfishness, indulgence, decadence, and consumption. Self-reliance is mainly about action, practicality, hard work, effort, self-blame, self-seeking, diligence, courage, enterprise, hard work, perseverance, loyalty, struggle, perseverance, and production. The morbidities of the general public can be corrected by self-reliance. I believe that self-reliance is really the most applicable to our country and the doctrine that can best inspire the national spirit. It is not only complete in theory.</p>

<p>— Guan Jingzhi</p>
<p>Walking along the road, I often see rows of stores displaying their merchandise in large glass windows. All kinds of goods are arranged neatly, sometimes very novel. The window dressing art of stores has improved a lot recently.</p>
<p>However, in the middle of a row of competing and dazzling large glass windows, I have also often seen shops that have closed down, looking like they have lost an eye. This is especially striking at night when the red neon lights make people's eyes ache. It is as if a "recession" sign has been inserted into the seemingly prosperous market.</p>
<p>However, I don't know when, many temporary book stalls have been added in front of these closed shops that look like they have lost an eye. Most of them use the window sills as bookshelves, displaying pirated old novels, such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "The Scholars," "The Scarlet Robe," "Biography of Yue Fei," "Family Letters of Zeng Wenzhenggong," "Letters from Qiushui Xuan," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Six Records of a Floating Life," and even stone-printed calligraphy books like those by Prince Cheng.</p>
<p>These books mostly have new-style punctuation and paragraphs, are printed on newspaper, and have kraft paper covers. The list price is not that low, but the selling price is "let go" to the point that people can hardly believe it: usually 10% off the discount. You can get a copy of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" for three or four mao.</p>
<p>This did not exist before! The prevalence of such "popular editions" on the one hand indicates the wide demand, but on the other hand, it may also reflect the struggle of the book industry in the tide of "recession," right? I often think this way.</p>
<p>In any case, the popularity of "popular editions" is always a good thing. In today's situation where the wallets of book buyers are getting thinner and thinner, "popular editions" are always beneficial to "culture."</p>
<p>I have had several transactions with these small book stalls. What I admire is that the printing of these "popular editions" is not bad. Old vernacular novels such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" hardly have any typos, and the punctuation is mostly correct. However, the classical "A New Account of Tales of the World" has more typos. This is not surprising. In such a "recession" era, for the sake of cost, these "popular editions" certainly cannot hire "experts" to proofread!</p>
<p>Recently, the application of "popular editions" has expanded to very "hardcore" major books. First, there were advertisements for zinc-plate reduced editions of the "Twenty-Five Histories," and then there were advertisements for typeset editions of the "Twenty-Six Histories." The pre-order price is getting cheaper and cheaper. We have seen the sample pages of the "Twenty-Five Histories," which are printed with photographic zinc plates. There is no need to worry about typos, but the font is a bit too small. It can only be used for reference and is not convenient for reading. What about the "Twenty-Six Histories"? I haven't seen the sample pages yet. But since it is typeset, I think it will be typeset with six-point type. The font is not too small, but, but, after seeing too many typos in "popular editions" such as "A New Account of Tales of the World," I can't help but wonder how many old gentlemen with reading glasses have been hired to carefully proofread this popular edition of the "Twenty-Six Histories"?</p>
<p>Proofreading is by no means a mechanical task. If "official history" and the like were proofread in a "mechanical" way, looking at one character at a time, it would be hard to guarantee that there would not be many jokes! The necessary condition for "popular editions" must also be that they are "readable," right?</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I feel that the "eyes" of the camera are always more reliable than human eyes!</p>
<h3 id="e183">It is Better to Have a Thorny Nose <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Longgong Gong</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. N.V. Gogol for writing the story of the nose and to Mr. Xu Xia for translating this work. Thanks to their respectable work, Mr. Nose has been introduced and we have had the pleasure of getting to know him.</p>
<p>I remember in Zhang Tianyi's "Diary of the Ghost Land," the nose was also regarded as something to be treated with caution. The author, to ridicule the concept of people considering the genitals as filthy and sinful organs, planted an unsanitary crime on the nose, so that the people living in the ghost land, both men and women, wore nose covers. However, this also prevented us from seeing its dignified appearance, leaving us with the regret of not being able to recognize it. I hate this harsh custom.</p>
<p>But how did the Fifth-Rank Civil Official Mr. Nose, who warned his master, the Eighth-Rank Collegiate Assessor Kovalev, treat us? He openly and frankly rode around St. Petersburg in a carriage. To avoid clumsy paraphrasing, I'd better do some copying:</p>
<p>"How should I approach him," Kovalev thought, "Look at everything! The dress uniform, the hat... In short, looking at his whole outfit, he must be a Fifth-Rank Civil Official. Damn it, this is terrible!"</p>
<p>He began to cough next to that gentleman, but the nose did not move at all.</p>
<p>"Respected sir..." Kovalev tried to brace himself, saying, "Respected sir..."</p>
<p>"What do you want?" the nose turned his face and replied.</p>
<p>"I really find it very strange, most respected sir... You should know your own whereabouts... But I suddenly saw you on the street... Where? ... Think for yourself..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying... Please speak more clearly."</p>
<p>"How can I speak more clearly?" Kovalev thought, and then braced himself again, continuing, "Naturally... Also, I am a Major. A Major like me, running around without a nose, isn't that too unsightly?... (The transcriber omits a few words)... Please think for yourself... There's really no way, I really... (At this time, Major Kovalev shrugged his shoulders)... Please forgive me... This matter, according to the laws of duty and honor... But you understand this very well yourself..."</p>
<p>"I don't understand at all," the nose replied, "Please speak more clearly."</p>
<p>"Respected sir," Kovalev said without losing his dignity, "Instead, I don't understand what you mean... Our matter is very clear... If you want me to say it... Then, you are... my nose!"</p>
<p>The nose stared at the Major, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>"You're mistaken, respected sir; I am myself. There can't be any close relationship between us. Because looking at the buttons on your clothes, I know that you work in a different government office." After saying this, the nose ignored him.</p>
<p>To be honest, Gogol was too irresponsible. Even if the nose had other tasks, how could he run around everywhere? Moreover, how could Kovalev confirm that the Fifth-Rank Civil Official was his own nose? Most people are not very able to recognize the shape of their own nose, even if they look in the mirror all day long. This is what we know. It is rare for a nose to suddenly refuse to recognize its master.</p>
<p>According to common sense, people's noses are far inferior to those of dogs. In the book "The Call of the Wild," we see that dogs, relying on their noses, are able to sense the slightest vibrations in the air, thus knowing where there are enemies, where there is food, or whether it will be sunny or rainy tomorrow. But human tasks are much more difficult than dogs: which path is profitable, which behavior can please the master, which clever plan can effortlessly kill people, which maneuver will consolidate one's own power, highlight one's reputation, and exert one's instinct, and what is especially difficult is how to achieve labor-saving but easy success; like a writer, without having to exert the effort of writing, but permanently dominate the literary world... All of this requires a nose that can sniff and drill, a nose that is even more powerful than a dog, to be able to accomplish.</p>
<p>Because of this, people can train their noses, let them out, drill into places that the body can't drill into, and make sounds of "humming," which are both flattering and contemptuous, which is easy to imagine. Moreover, people with more wisdom than Kovalev can decorate it, so that it does not develop stagnation (called acne in Cantonese), just like savages, engraving patterns on it. This is more charming, easier to recognize and manage, and will not be as absurd and rampant as the Fifth-Rank Civil Official.</p>
<p>Everything about our ancestors was more perfect and intelligent than us, and many people are currently proving this, and such a proposal can also be made for the reform of the earliest part of this body.</p>

<h3 id="e184">The Life and Origin of Wheat <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Sheng</p>
<p>Wheat is the most important food in the world. Although Chinese people in many places eat rice, they also eat wheat, and wheat is still grown a lot; it is often seen. If you take a few grains of wheat and put them on moist soil, you will see them gradually absorb moisture and swell. After a few days, a tender white root will emerge from one end of the wheat grain. The first roots that emerge are often three, unlike barley, which often has five, or beans, which only have one. The root grows from the lower part of the embryo, at which time the embryo is still inside the wheat grain, lying sideways in a corner at one end of the wheat grain. Soon, the upper end of the embryo also pierces through, and then you see green tender leaves. Next to the embryo there is also a shield-shaped organ, which remains in the wheat grain, and most botanists recognize it as a successive cotyledon, which remains in the wheat grain and is used to absorb the nutrients inside. When the seedling is able to stand on its own, the nutrients inside the wheat grain have also been used up, and the transformed cotyledon withers, and the wheat grain is separated from the seedling.</p>
<p>After the wheat germinates, fine roots gradually grow at the lower part, and green leaves grow at the upper part, and the stem also grows. Its first leaf is shaped like a spearhead, and is incompletely grown, and the second leaf is the same, and then fully developed leaves grow. If there is adequate sunlight, air, and nutrients in the soil are not lacking, it will grow up.</p>
<p>Grown wheat, often seen in the fields, it grows hollow, segmented stalks, with narrow, grass-like leaves growing on the nodes. Subsequently, ears grow on the stalks, and many small flowers grow on the ears. Those small flowers are grown extremely small and simple. Each small flower is wrapped on the outside by two pieces of husk, which are parts equivalent to the sepals of ordinary flowers. Inside there are even smaller two small petals, almost invisible without a magnifying glass. This is probably the part equivalent to the petals, but it has degenerated and become very small. Next are three stamens, with long filaments and pollen-bearing parts, called anthers. In the center is a pistil, with two stigmas on top, split into feathery shapes, which are the parts that receive pollen.</p>
<p>The ear grows, and the flowers also mature, and it unfolds. The flowering time may be early or late depending on the climate, but according to records, it is often at four o'clock in the morning on a sunny day. After an hour or two, it closes again. When it is open, if a breeze blows, carrying the pollen and dropping it on the stigmas of other flowers, the ovules in the ovary are fertilized; flowers that have not been fertilized are fertilized by their own pollen after closing. Most plants must be fertilized before they can bear fruit, like some cottonseeds and bananas, unfertilized fruits will also grow, but they do not contain seeds inside.</p>
<p>Its ovule grows, not only growing into a young embryo, but also producing endosperm that will provide nutrients for its germination in the future. Endosperm is mostly flour, in addition to protein and fat. After the wheat grains turn yellow and ripen, they become the wheat seeds that are planted.</p>
<p>Wheat belongs to the so-called annual type of plant, it withers after flowering and fruiting once in a year. Although many annual plants, wheat is the same, if it is prevented from flowering and fruiting, it can also live for more than a year, but under normal circumstances, it only lives for one year (actually only a few months). However, plants that flower once are not necessarily all annual. Some plants, such as the common chickweed, anciently called fanlu, grow, flower, bear fruit, and die quickly, and can grow several times a year. Many plants, such as radishes or turnips, germinate this year, store nutrients in the swelling formed by the connection of the roots and stems, for flowering and fruiting next year, some bamboos flower and die once after decades, agave, growing in its native land of Mexico, flowers after eight to ten years, growing on the Mediterranean coast, takes twenty to fifty years to flower, and the years of flowering in other places are even longer, hence the name "century plant." But it only flowers once in its life, and its nature is different from plants such as peaches and plums that flower every year and bloom for many years.</p>
<p>The nutrients stored in the wheat grains for the growth of the embryo are the main food of mankind. These nutrients are created by the leaves using carbon dioxide in the air, moisture and minerals in the soil, with the help of sunlight, in parts containing green matter. Wheat-growing areas in the world occupy about 400,000 square miles. Wheat is grown almost everywhere from the Arctic Circle to the highlands of the equator, and yellow wheat grains can be seen throughout the year.</p>
<p>The place of origin of this widely cultivated wheat is still unclear to this day. There are many species and varieties of wheat, and botanists divide them into three categories. The first category has very small grains and low nutritional value, and is now rarely cultivated. This category is called Einklrn. The second category is slightly better, and is called Emmer. The third type can be used to make bread. The first type is found wild in various parts of Asia Minor. The wild type of the second type is found in Syria, probably in southern Syria to the Moab Mountains. Only the widely cultivated type of wheat has never been seen as a wild species. The British agricultural botanist Percival once suggested that its ancestor should be a hybrid of Emmer and another grass species (Aegiops Ovata or Ae. Cylindrica). In recent years, another botanist, Gates, said that wheat should be a hybrid of wild Emmer and wild Emmer. According to various studies, its earliest cultivation site was in southwestern Asia.</p>
<p>In 1926, the Chinese botanist Vavilov published a paper "Research on the Origin of Cultivated Plants," also saying that the earliest cultivation site of wheat should be in southwestern Asia. Vavilov opposed the opinion of the earlier botanist de Conodlle. de Conodlle's famous work "The Origin of Cultivated Plants" was published in 1882, saying that the place of origin of cultivated plants should be near where the wild species of that plant grows. Vavilov said that the earliest place of cultivation can only be determined from where there are the most cultivated varieties. The place with the most cultivated varieties of wheat is first eastern Afghanistan, followed by Persia, and then Transcaucasia. According to Vavilov's opinion, Afghanistan is the earliest place of origin of wheat. Planting in Persia was also early, and Transcaucasia is a "secondary center," which means that it was imported from various places. Other researchers agree that wheat originated in southwestern Asia, but there are slight differences in the details. Sometimes researchers believe that Transcaucasia should be the earliest center of origin of wheat, and Afghanistan does not seem to be the earliest place of origin. Persia may be the earliest cultivation site, but it cannot be determined. The investigation into the earliest place of origin of wheat is a very complex issue, and it is understandable that researchers today cannot agree on opinions, but after another period of investigation in the future, they will naturally tend to be consistent.</p>

<p>"Amitabha! This murderous Shoufu Cannon!"</p>
<p>Kaiyang Ma Pi's mother held a dissenting opinion.</p>
<p>"Hmph," putting down his wine glass, Mu Renlao smiled. "Speaking reasonably, Shoufu Cannon should also get twenty yuan. Shoufu Cannon didn't ask for the wrong amount!"</p>
<p>"What! Shoufu Cannon should also get twenty yuan a month." Mr. Dasheng turned his face, almost jumping up, staring at Mu Renlao. "Then you go and pay this twenty yuan!"</p>
<p>"Isn't there more money from donations?" Mu Renlao insisted.</p>
<p>"Don't you need to pay for supplies? One is willing to go, and the other is caught. Even if he doesn't get a penny, who will he bite (At this point, Mr. Dasheng was no longer civilized.) It's the fifteen yuan subsidy that was wrong! Damn it, he's really not human!"</p>
<p>"So! A Zhao gets twenty yuan, A Zhao is willing to go..." Mr. Feng Wen took off his coat and continued, but before he could finish speaking, a woman's crying suddenly broke in!</p>
<p>"We don't want this twenty yuan of life-selling money! Give me A Zhao back! Give me A Zhao back!"</p>

<h3 id="e186">Establishment of Puppet Education Institutions Created by Japanese and Puppets in Northeast China <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Northeast Youth Further Anesthetized</p>
<p>Luring Mongolian Princes to Complete Invasion of Mongolia Plan</p>
<p>Changchun, Northeast News, the violent Japanese, in order to thoroughly implement the enslavement of Northeast youth, have been promoting the establishment of Jilin Higher Normal School for a long time, and officially opened the school in the middle of last month. On August 25, in "Fengtian" Jilin, Harbin, and other places, freshmen were tested for three days, and 345 candidates were registered, and 100 were admitted. The students admitted this time, and the professors appointed by the school, are the most qualified people with decadent thoughts and dull minds. In the first year, the number of faculty and staff is initially determined to be 36, and will gradually increase in the future. Its acting principal is nominally temporarily filled by Xu, the vice minister of the puppet Ministry of Education, but the real power is still controlled by the Japanese to facilitate the implementation of their enslavement education. The Japanese bandits also instigated the puppet Ministry of Education to set up normal schools in provinces and cities to enslave the youth of the entire Northeast, and transferred more than 20 existing normal schools established by various provinces and special zones to be directly under the puppet Ministry of Education, in order to actively cultivate enslavement teaching materials and popularize their anesthetic education. The purpose is to make the national and ethnic thoughts of Northeast youth disappear, trapping our compatriots in an irretrievable situation. The Japanese bandits' long-term conspiracy to occupy us can be said to be poisonous and ruthless. In addition, in order to actively invade Outer Mongolia, the violent Japanese recently convened the so-called Mongolian Banner Representative Conference by the Puppet Rehe Provincial Government, and instigated the Puppet Xiehe Association Rehe Local Affairs Bureau to hold the so-called symposium during the period when various princes gathered, taking the opportunity to win over them to complete their plan to invade Mongolia. After the Puppet Xiehe Association Local Office was ordered, it held a "Man" Mongolian symposium in the Puppet Office on the 10th of this month. At that time, the Mongols who were invited were Prince Boer of the Tumote Right Banner, Xieheli Gedu of the same banner, Tumote, the director of the Bin Branch of the same banner, Prince Dansangbu of the Zuoyi Banner, Lin, the deputy chapter of the Xiaokulun Banner Management, Qindaoerji, Sumuyakalahan of the same banner, Yushan, the deputy chapter of the Zhongqi Xiangliguan, Yushan, the white secretary officer of the same banner, and Wuxieli Xiangfu of the Zuoyi Banner.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province suffered a severe drought this summer, and local tax revenue was greatly affected. Governor Lu Dipin and Education Director Ye Suzhong, fearing that education would be suspended, telegraphed the county magistrates yesterday to do their best to raise education funds to ensure that education could be maintained. The original telegram said: The county magistrates of each county are requested to read this. This year's drought has affected local tax revenue, and as a result, education is inevitably suspended. However, education is the foundation of the country, and the related funding is the mother of the cause. Each county magistrate should do their best to raise funds and issue funds as usual. If former county magistrates or finance directors have collected and not issued funds, the current county magistrates and directors should immediately reissue them. Those who have no outstanding debts should collect and issue as much as possible. If the funds issued are already exhausted and there is still a shortage compared to the budget, they should also raise funds within the scope of the county's local funds and pay them out, so as to ensure that education can be maintained and the cause will not be suspended. In addition to sending separate telegrams, this is a hasty telegram ordering compliance, and binding the Finance Bureau to comply as one.

<p>▲ Mayor's Talk: At 10:00 am, they gathered in the City Government Auditorium. The Mayor led the memorial week and performed the ceremonies as usual. After the ceremonies, the Mayor gave a talk, roughly stating that there were two meanings for gathering the instructors to participate in the memorial week today. First, it is very hard for the instructors to come to Shanghai to take charge of military training in various schools in this abnormal state and complicated situation, so I would like to express my condolences to everyone. Second, I would like to take this opportunity to offer a few suggestions. The academic atmosphere in Shanghai schools has been slightly better in the past two or three years, and the result of military training is also a part of the effect. China is currently facing serious difficulties, but national disasters do not happen suddenly. China has been in a period of national disasters since the Opium War in 1884. If we want to eliminate this national disaster, it cannot be done in a day or two, so we have to rely on today's youth, especially educated youth. If we want to rely on youth, we must restrain and discipline them without getting discouraged, so that they can become organized and disciplined citizens to shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending and saving the country. Nowadays, all countries in the world, whether in politics, economy, or military, are centered on national defense. The future war will require total mobilization of the entire country. Our country boasts of its vast territory and abundant resources, but 450 million people are unorganized, undisciplined, and untrained. How can we drive them to fight? Although the resources are abundant, they cannot be developed and manufactured. Raw materials cannot be made into products. What use are they? Therefore, President Chiang Kai-shek advocates the New Life Movement to militarize the people of the whole country to achieve this goal. European and American countries underwent major transformations after the Industrial Revolution a hundred years ago. Our country is still dreaming today. It is truly fortunate that we have not perished immediately. But we cannot regard luck as a principle. If we cannot make efforts to carry on the past and open up the future, the country will perish on our shoulders. Therefore, we should bear the responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. If we work hard, the country can be revived. If we do not work hard, the country will definitely perish. I hope everyone will work hard.</p>
<p>▲ Director's Talk: After the ceremony, they gathered in front of the City Government Auditorium and took a group photo with Mayor Wu, Director Pan, and others to commemorate the occasion. They then went to the Municipal Education Bureau, where Director Pan gave a talk, roughly stating: (1) When you go to serve in various schools, because many schools do not fully understand, many difficulties will definitely arise. Therefore, we recently convened a meeting of school principals to break through these difficulties. (2) Currently, many schools cannot provide salaries according to the standards promulgated by the Ministry due to financial difficulties. Some schools have relatively higher salaries, and there is a great inequality in treatment. We are also thinking about how to make the instructors in various schools have the same treatment. (3) Military training is not only about teaching students to attend classes and drills, but also about training students to be organized, disciplined, and fond of group life. Therefore, we will suggest to the Central Government in the future that military instructors in various schools should also serve as trainers. After the talk, everyone returned, and Director Jiao convened a luncheon before everyone returned to their schools.</p>

<p>The Provincial Suzhou Middle School's Department of Chemical Engineering has been operating with remarkable achievements since its establishment. The affiliated factory is also thriving. Schools across the country that offer secondary chemical engineering courses often model their facilities after this department. Even places as far as Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Southeast Asia have sent specialists to Suzhou to study and learn from it. This winter vacation, nineteen students will be graduating. Besides those continuing to university engineering programs, all have already secured positions in suitable factories. It is also reported that these graduates, wanting to understand the actual conditions of Shanghai's chemical industry, have formed a tour group led by the department head, Wang Jialing. They are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 15th of this month, staying at Chengzhong Middle School on Tangshan Road. The planned tour duration is ten days. Major chemical factories in Shanghai have been contacted and have agreed to provide hospitality.</p>

<p>The library undertaking in our country has been quite developed in recent years, but specialized works on library science are still rarely seen, especially those that guide users in how to use the library. In view of this, the editor of this book, Mr. Lu Shaoyu, a lecturer at Great China University, has specially compiled this book based on his research insights and experience to serve as a guide for those who use libraries. The contents are divided into eight sections: 1. The Structure of Books, 2. The Arrangement of Books in the Library, 3. Card Catalogs, 4. Dictionaries, 5. Encyclopedias, 6. Other Reference Books, 7. Reader Guidance, 8. Bibliographies, etc., which are very practical.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Personal Views on Implementing Production Education (Part 4) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲ Speech by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, at the General Meeting of Members of the Third District Education Association in this City</p>
<p>How to guide primary and secondary school students towards the path of production? In other words, how to make them have interest, knowledge, skills, and habits in production? The most important thing is that the teachers who teach the courses in general primary and secondary schools are willing to take responsibility. If they can take production as the center of the primary and secondary school curriculum, teaching materials, teaching methods, and training goals, design methods of reform, implement them through experiments, and then promote them, then it will not be difficult for teachers to lead primary and secondary school students onto the path of production. Many people say that teachers teach different subjects. Teachers who teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology... teachers in science subjects, and teachers who teach crafts, and agricultural and industrial subjects, are close to nature and can of course lead students to production. However, teachers who teach civics, Chinese, social studies... teachers in humanities subjects, only know how to teach students to read, write, study, and compose essays, and read history and geography, which have nothing to do with production skills. Speaking of this, I want to mention teaching materials. I believe that the current teaching materials really need fundamental reform. A few days ago, I went to a primary school in the countryside of Jiangwan Township to inspect, and I saw fifth and sixth grade students taking history class, talking about the Crusades. The Crusades certainly had an impact on the spread of world culture, but it may not necessarily have much to do with the children in our Chinese villages. What is called the Crusades? Why did they want to go on an eastern expedition? Can the teacher explain it in detail? Can rural children of eleven or twelve years old understand it? They can't even figure out the several dynasties in Chinese history, but they have to memorize foreign names such as Alexander of Macedon. What exactly is going on? Taking the Crusades as an example, the dispute between Christianity and Islam, the establishment and destruction of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the success and failure of the seven or eight eastern expeditions, and the impact on the communication between Eastern and Western cultures, etc., can be taught in universities, and long lectures can be compiled. Orally, it can be at least one or two hours, and students can take notes of hundreds or thousands of words. This is a historical fact with a lot of material, but in primary school textbooks, everything is included in only two or three sentences. I ask, which teacher has the ability to use only two or three sentences to make children around ten years old understand the Crusades? They will inevitably read it once according to the book, and it is good enough if the children can remember it. What relationship does this kind of teaching material have with the children's own lives? Therefore, when we talk about history, we should pay attention to the relationship with the primary and secondary school students themselves, and we should pay attention to production. For example, first talk about the local history of a certain place, the evolution of production technology in the local area, and then the production capacity and production methods of the Chinese nation, how it was before, how the annual evolution is, and whether it is progress or degradation now. For example, Shennong taught people how to cultivate, Leizu taught people how to raise silkworms, the well-field system of the Three Dynasties, Shang Yang's abolition of field boundaries... these are all historical facts related to people's livelihoods, and should be specifically brought up in advance, so that students can know how our ancestors produced and improved in the past... how precious production is. If so, although history is taught, the history he teaches is very relevant to production. Similarly, those who teach Chinese can also adopt materials about production, such as narrating the material selection and methods of carpenters making tables and chairs, describing the feelings of seeing cotton in the fields during suburban travel, visiting yarn factories, etc., announcements of recruiting workers, donation appeals for purchasing water-lifting machines... On the one hand, they teach them to read and write articles, but on the other hand, they have practical uses, giving primary and secondary school students a very important impression of production. It cannot be said that it has nothing to do with production. Since this is the case, why not imitate the current unit design of primary schools and always use "production" as a consistent teaching material center in primary and secondary schools? In addition, the distribution of courses is also very important. If we follow the current course distribution of primary and secondary schools, I am afraid that students, especially children in primary schools, will feel that there is no time to do production experiments and labor work, because there are too many subjects and the amount is too heavy. Therefore, if we believe that production education is the path to take in the future, then we should ask teachers to make a determination to thoroughly transform the selection of teaching materials and the allocation of courses.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I had some ideas about this issue of teaching materials and courses, and now I will tentatively put them forward as a reference. I believe that teaching materials should be selected as the central teaching materials only after careful and objective screening in the children's life tendencies. Our curriculum is "the whole life" and should also implement "production education" in "life." In primary schools, we must oppose the past compartmentalized teaching method with its heavy workload, because children's psychology is different from adults. What they need is not a rigid classroom life of lecturing and talking about metaphysics, but interesting activities. Teachers should always guide children's interests and satisfy their desire for knowledge. For example, children like to raise chickens and raise organisms, and they all have the nature of asking questions. They must be wondering how they were born, why they were born so beautifully, what to feed them, what is the use of them... Then they will ask the teacher to give them a satisfactory solution. This is the beginning of the motive for designing and doing schoolwork. Later, you can teach him to actually feed them, read stories about chicks, calculate the value of feed and the amount of eggs laid, write the words "chicks eat white rice," play the game "hawks catch chicks," sing the song "little chicks"... These many things start from the motive of raising chickens and continue until the children's desires are satisfied. It is not to instill knowledge into children for no reason. It is always the need of the children's own lives, which also indicates the path of production to them. It is learning from doing, teaching from doing, it is real learning, it is real teaching, and it is a method of learning and teaching with the spirit of design, so that children can gain interest, knowledge, skills, and habits in production from actual life. This is "production education" in primary schools. (To be continued)</p>

<p>It is already late autumn and all countries are unprepared.</p>
<p>A meeting of representatives from various countries for the Shanghai International Track and Field Games was held at the Shenyuan Football Field yesterday (the 14th) at 5:30 pm. Those present were Huai Lun (British Army), Ke Fen (British Army), Huai Xu (British), Si Huohua Dun (American Mailings), Hao Er (Xiqing and Haiqing), Bai Naite (American), Jiang Xiangqing (Chinese), Rong Qizhao (Chinese), Zhang Guoxun (Chinese), Le Xiurong (Chinese), Agoye de (French Army). The meeting was chaired by Mr. Shen Siliang, the executive of the Association. After reporting the reasons for the meeting, the date of the current Games was discussed. The representatives believed that the time was already late autumn, and that the countries were not adequately prepared. Rather than rushing to complete it in this inappropriate period, it would be more appropriate to postpone it to next spring. Therefore, it was decided by a majority vote to postpone this Games.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Sports Association to Hold All-Shanghai Open Women's Games Next Spring <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>▲ Open to all nationalities</p>
<p>▲ Events same as National Games</p>
<p>At the last National Games, the women's track and field athletes from this city, Qian Hangsu and Chen Rongming, showed their skills and won championships, earning supreme glory for Shanghai. Qian Chen and Chen Shuqing, Wang Huachang and other veterans have continued to train hard since returning from the National Games in Nanjing. It is a pity that there are very few competition opportunities for women's track and field in Shanghai, so they have no place to use their skills and their ambitions are difficult to achieve, which inevitably leads to discouragement. The newcomers lack courage because of this. Therefore, when the Sports Association convened a meeting of representatives from various countries at the Shenyuan yesterday, a Chinese representative strongly suggested to Mr. Shen Siliang, the executive of the Sports Association, to hold the All-Shanghai Women's Games to promote women's track and field as much as possible, so that veterans would not retire and there would be no lack of successors. Shen deeply appreciated his words and immediately expressed his decision to hold an All-Shanghai Open Women's Games next spring, open to all nationalities, to increase the interest in competition and promote the progress of results. The events will be roughly the same as the National Games, in preparation for Shanghai to participate in the National Games. It is indeed a win-win situation.</p>

<h3 id="e210">The Impact of the Silver Tax Increase <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Since the silver tax increase was implemented yesterday, the market has seen a sudden impact, with the most severe being the standard gold. The opening price immediately rose by 19 yuan and 1 jiao (927.5), and the highest was 930 yuan and 8 jiao. As a result, it rose by 9 yuan and 7 jiao. Yarn prices also rose by 1 yuan and 5 jiao, and flower prices rose by 3 or 4 jiao. Public bonds also saw an upward trend in the initial session, but in the end, as soon as there was a rise, there was an outflow, and the market was difficult to rise. Coarse sand and white sugar also rose, but the actual sales were stagnant, and the rise was very small. The rise in flour and wheat was even more crazy. Although foreign rice still has other reasons, it also rose by 2 jiao because of it.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Silver Tax Increase Causes Bullion Price to Rise by 9.7 Yuan <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Spot Premium Still Flat, Difficult to Trigger a Squeeze</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Initially Firm, Then Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market surged after the Chinese government announced an increase in the silver export tax to 7.75%, along with a requirement to make up the difference in exchange rates to balance the tax. This move would prevent banks from exporting silver, ensuring that silver would no longer flow out of the country. Due to exchange rate issues, banks lacked capital, causing panic among short-selling Chinese merchants. The foreign exchange market became extremely tight, stimulating the gold market, and causing bullion prices to rise. However, November contracts are based on foreign exchange rates, while December contracts will be based on a new pure gold settlement standard, which will be greatly affected. Moreover, the November contracts are approaching their rollover date. Therefore, although the gold market rose, it was not strong enough, and the underlying trend was quite flat and weak. The market opened with pre-market bids at 927.2 yuan, with very bullish sentiment. Short sellers rushed to cover, and the price rose to around 930 yuan in a blink of an eye before slightly falling. After the official opening, short sellers continued to cover, and the domestic market was extremely tight, once approaching the 930 yuan mark. However, after the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with the British pound flat and the US dollar down only slightly by 0.1875, the new standard had no impact. At the same time, those holding long positions in November contracts took advantage of the high prices to sell, gradually falling by more than 9 yuan. Some in the market said that the new tax was a trial run for two weeks. When the HSBC exchange rates were announced, with the British pound down 0.0375 and the US dollar down 0.0875, the foreign exchange market became even tighter. Chinese merchants continued to cover, struggling because banks had no appetite to sell, so the price rebounded. In addition, the swap premium rose to around 6 yuan, and buying suddenly became strong, breaking through the 930 yuan mark. However, supply suddenly increased at the high prices, and the price gradually fell, but still struggled. Later, as the swap premium became cheaper, market sentiment also turned weak, and large players also started to sell and move to spot positions. The public's attention shifted significantly. With the deadline for November contracts approaching, many long positions were rolled over, and the spot premium dropped to 1 yuan, causing the gold market to fall again. At noon, with the spot premium still stable, the Central Bank announced that a balanced tax of 4.75% would be levied today, and the domestic market was still difficult to cover. After a period of weakness, it turned slightly stable. The market was stable in the afternoon, but the swap premium gradually fell, and market sentiment turned from stable to weak. Despite large players buying, supply exceeded demand, and the price gradually fell. Although there was a struggle at the 920 yuan mark, the overall trend was still weak. There were rumors that the new tax rules still faced obstacles. In reality, the only major short seller left was Zhengchang, who had already largely moved into the December contracts. Most retail short sellers had already covered, making it difficult to stir up buying. Finally, although the price fell due to a sharp rise in silver, it was still able to rebound after the drop. The market situation was chaotic throughout the day. With November contracts approaching rollover and the Central Bank's exchange rates being relatively small, market sentiment was not very bullish. The swap premium was between 2.1 and 2.7 yuan in the market. There were rumors that the Central Bank was occasionally opening spot positions. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The market opened at 927.5 yuan in the morning, up 19.1 yuan from last Saturday, and the foreign exchange market suddenly became extremely tight. Ruixing, Tongyi, Dachangxiang, and Jintiao rose from 7 yuan to 9.8 yuan. HSBC's January forward price was 0.9375, while Hengyu, Fuxing, Yongdingkang, and Dadecheng's forward price fell to 4 yuan. Dadecheng slightly bought at the low price, suddenly rising to 5.5 yuan. Yuankang, Xiangfuxing, and Yongfulai sold, and the price fell again to 1.5 yuan. The Central Bank's forward exchange rate remained unchanged. HSBC's announcement of the British pound falling by 0.0375 and the US dollar falling by 0.0875 was anticipated. Fuchang, Yuansheng, Yongqing, Yuyuan, Yuyong, Zhaofengchang, etc. bought one after another, gradually rising. Banque Belge covered December US dollars at 0.0625, and the price rose to 7.8 yuan. Hengyu, Fuan, Zhaofengchang, Dalianbang, Dafa Yong, etc. continued to sell, and the price fell again to 5.8 yuan. The swap premium was expected to rise to around 6 yuan, and market sentiment improved. Brokers aggressively covered December US dollars at 0.05625, but failed. Then, Banque Belge covered January US dollars at 0.04375. Yicheng, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Yuansheng Yong, Fuan, and Tongchun bought repeatedly, and the price rose to 930.08 yuan, mainly because the swap market was firm. Mitsui sold December US dollars at 0.0375. Hengxing, Dalianbang, Hengyu, Fuxing Yong sold, and the price fell to 926.6 yuan. Yuanyi Fuxing Yong bought at the low price and then rebounded to 928.7 yuan. After entering the afternoon, the swap premium became smaller and smaller, and market sentiment also weakened. Yuanyi, Hengyu, Qingyu, Qianchangxiang, Yuanyong Hongxing, etc. jointly sold, and the market became oversupplied as long positions were closed, gradually falling. Although there was some support in the middle, Dadecheng suddenly sold, and the market's attention shifted. The spot premium once fell to within 1.5 yuan, and the gold market also fell to 921.4 yuan. Hengyu and Dadecheng bought contracts at low prices, and general short sellers also rushed to sell. The swap premium rose, and the gold price rebounded to 925.8 yuan. Shunmao, Yuanyong Bingxing, etc. sold, and the price fell again to 923.3 yuan. Yuanyong bought contracts at low prices, managing to maintain the price. At noon, the market closed at 923.4 yuan. After the market closed, the trend rebounded, once rising to around 925 yuan.</p>
<p>The market opened at 924.8 yuan in the afternoon, and market sentiment was weak, falling from 925 yuan. The swap premium fell again to 2.5 yuan. Hengyu Yuanchang Yong Yuanchun sold contracts, falling to 1 yuan. Yuqing Yong Yuanyong Tianfeng bought at low prices, rising to 3.5 yuan. Mitsui sold January forward contracts at 0.0875. Banque Belge bought December US dollars at 0.075. Dadecheng Hengyu sold contracts, and Futaiheng, Dachangxiang, Yuqing Yong still bought, and there was still a struggle. Later, Hengyu Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Yongfeng Fuchang came to sell, and the price fell to 919.5 yuan. Hengxing Yuanyong bought contracts at low prices, rebounding twice. However, market sentiment was weak, and retail long positions sold, gradually falling from outside 921 yuan to within 920 yuan. Fuchang Yongfeng Tongfu Yuanchun sold heavily, and the price fell further to 918.3 yuan. HSBC covered spot forward contracts at 1 shilling and 6 pence. Macaulay covered January US dollars at 0.0875. Huixiang Hongli bought to 0.02 yuan, but with Mumbai rising 19 annas, Dalianbang Zhengchang, etc. sold, and the price fell further to 917.3 yuan. Hengxing Huixiang competed to buy at low prices, rising sharply to 918.8 yuan. The market closed at 918.1 yuan, and the market was stable after closing. The highest price of the day was 930.08 yuan, and the lowest price was 917.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 13.5 yuan. As a result, the price rose by 9.7 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The new December standard still follows the old standard for conversion. The morning opening was also high at 927.5 yuan, up 19.1 yuan. The noon closing was 923.4 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 924.8 yuan, and then fluctuated with the swap premium. By the time of closing, it was 2.7 yuan lower than the old standard, at 915.4 yuan, which was 7 yuan higher than last Saturday. Trading will officially begin today.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on HSBC's US dollar exchange rate falling by 0.0875, was 36.125 yuan, equivalent to a bullion price of 957.78 yuan. According to the closing price, the margin was about less than 40 yuan, which was about 13 yuan weaker than last Saturday. The new December standard, due to the Central Bank's standard bullion price falling to 928.4 yuan, the margin was about 13 yuan according to the closing price, which was more than 9 yuan less than last Saturday. The registration price for this month is 923 yuan, and the same price for December. The morning margin call was 923 yuan, and the afternoon margin call was 918 yuan. Refined gold was priced about 10 yuan higher, at 937.5 yuan, and trading in the market was more active. After the gold market rose, customers were willing to sell, and more than 3,000 taels were sold by Tianjin merchants. Dadecheng bought 2,100 taels, and Yingfeng Heng bought 1,400 taels, with a premium of 11.5 yuan. The Central Bank occasionally opened spot positions, totaling about 1,000 contracts, with prices slightly higher than futures contracts. The swap market was extremely volatile.</p>
<p>In the morning, with the bullion price skyrocketing, most buyers were very willing to roll over. The market was flat at the opening. Then, Hengyu sold 35 contracts to Hengxing for only 3.8 yuan. However, sellers also became more active, and although Dalianbang Wanxing sold, the price gradually increased. After entering the afternoon, although Senchang Yong came to sell, large players such as Dadecheng Hengyu Yuqing Yong worked hard to sell, and the price rose to around 6 yuan. Qingfa Yong, Ruikang, Futaiheng, and Chunyuanyong gradually sold, and the price gradually fell. With Dalianbang continuing to sell, Dadecheng suddenly sold, and the general market's attention shifted greatly. Then, buyers suddenly competed to sell, and although Senchang Yong Fuyu came to sell, the price still fell to 1 yuan. Yuanyong Senchang Yong Fuyu Hengchang Yong, etc. bought at low prices, and the price rebounded to around 5 yuan. Yuanyong, etc. sold in the afternoon and then fell back to within 3.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e212">Foreign Exchange Market Extremely Tight, Open and Hidden <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Show Strong Buying Interest</p>
<p>Near and Far Term Rates Approaching Parity</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was extremely tense yesterday. Foreign news reported that London’s long-term interest rates only decreased slightly, by 0.0625, with US banks remaining unchanged. The spot price of gold in London decreased by 4 pence, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar decreased by 0.02375, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound decreased by 0.015, the exchange rate between the British pound and the French franc decreased by 17 points, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and the French franc decreased by 0.01125. However, it was reported that China would implement a 7.75% increase in the silver export tax starting yesterday, bringing the total tax rate, including previous taxes, to 1%, and that a balancing tax would be levied on the difference between foreign and Shanghai exchange rates. This measure had a significant impact on the foreign exchange market, as the new tax made it impossible for banks to ship silver profitably, making it similar to a ban on silver exports. This naturally led to a shortage of domestic funds. The market was chaotic at the opening, with the near-term selling price for the British pound at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 0.9375, and the US dollar at 36.75 yuan, which was 0.0375 higher for the US dollar compared to the closing price on Saturday. Although there was some supply after the opening, it was limited, with an initial easing followed by tightening. The HSBC exchange rates were announced, with the British pound down 0.0375 and the US dollar down 0.0875. Near and far term rates were largely on par after that, with banks showing no willingness to sell. The market situation eased in the afternoon, and the price of silver rose. Banks continued to supply, but Chinese buyers became less interested. At the closing, the near-term selling price was 1 shilling, 5 pence, 0.9375 for the British pound and 36.875 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.01875 higher for the British pound and 0.04375 higher for the US dollar compared to the previous closing price. Chinese merchants bought approximately one million US dollars. The daily activity depended entirely on whether the Chinese merchants bought or not. The transaction prices for the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The near-term selling price for the British pound opened at 1 shilling, 5 pence, 0.9375 in the morning.

<h3 id="e213">Silver Coin Market Still Lacking Activity <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The silver coin market initially saw fluctuations due to silver exports and speculative activity last month, but recently it has returned to a stagnant state. On the surface, this cessation of volatility might seem like a positive sign for the financial system. However, the underlying cause is the economic distress and the difficulty in extending loans. Market sentiment remained unenthusiastic yesterday. The interest rate on silver coins remained at 6% in both the morning and afternoon, unchanged from previous days. The initial interest rate on silver coins with a premium was 3%, but it was later changed to no interest. In the morning, there were over 4.0 million transactions for silver coins with premium, while the afternoon saw 400,000 transactions. Small associations traded over 600,000. Redemption of silver coin mortgages amounted to 900,000, with 1.3 million in new mortgages. Bank settlements were slightly busier due to the beginning of the week. Foreign banks settled over 3.3 million in bills, 4.4 million in various currency, freight, and mortgage loans, 700,000 in telegraphic transfers, 800,000 in special transfers, 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 in warehouse transactions. Chinese banks settled over 3.5 million in bills, 4.6 million in various currency, freight, and mortgage loans, 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, 900,000 in special transfers, 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlements, 600,000 in customs duties, and 800,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks settled over 2.8 million in bills, 4.4 million in various currency, freight, and mortgage loans, 1.6 million in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 in warehouse withdrawals.

<p>Yesterday, small Jiangnan silver coins were priced at 820 yuan in the morning. The price increased by 6 yuan in the afternoon due to the improving market situation, reaching 826 yuan.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e215">Silver Tax Increases, Yarn and Cotton Prices Rise <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Market Participants React Strongly, Actively Buying</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Still Sell Despite the Price Increase</p>
<p>The yarn market is tightening, and the upward trend is slightly stronger. The reasons for the increase are: (1) The government's increase in the silver export tax; (2) The rumor that the consolidated tax will increase by 20% per bale starting November 1 (whether this is true remains to be seen). Due to these two major reasons, market participants are reacting strongly, and speculators are actively buying to push up prices. However, Japanese merchants and manufacturers are taking the opportunity to sell. Domestic purchases account for approximately two-thirds of the total transaction volume, which is somewhat speculative. The spot price of Japanese yarn has increased by around 0.5 yuan. It is said that Chinese-owned factories have released as many as 2,800 bales of spot yarn.</p>
<p>(Future Yarn Prices Rise by 1.5 Yuan) At the opening of the future yarn market, prices rose due to the silver tax increase, and short positions were covered. However, Japanese merchants also took advantage of the rise to sell, which suppressed the market to some extent. Nevertheless, prices for all months rose by 1.589 yuan to 2 yuan. It was reported in the afternoon that Japanese merchants continued to sell and increase their short positions. Over 5,000 bales of spot yarn were traded during the day, of which 2,000 to 3,000 bales were bought by domestic merchants. It is said that half of this was speculative. As a result, market sentiment eased slightly in the afternoon, and prices for all months fell back by 0.347 yuan. Total trading volume was quite high, at 62,100 bales. The sellers included Deji (750 bales), Mingde (1,200 bales), Hexing (1,300 bales), Shenchang (1,800 bales), Renfeng (3,450 bales), Yuantai (1,300 bales), Taichang (1,150 bales), Changfeng (2,350 bales), Runkang (600 bales), Xiecheng (800 bales), Xiesheng (1,000 bales), Dafeng (1,350 bales), and Huikang (1,200 bales).

<p>(5,200 Bales of Spot Yarn Sold) Spot yarn sales remain strong. According to statistics, a total of 5,200 bales were bought by various merchants during the day. The average price increase was 1 yuan. Domestic merchants were the largest buyers. The purchase amounts are listed below:</p>
<p>Changsha 230 Domestic 2,175 Tianjin 225 Northern 25</p>
<p>Shantou 120 Henan 1,000 Guangdong 785 Trading 160</p>
<p>Fujian 55 Wuhu 35 Luzhou 40 Yunnan 40</p>
<p>Ningbo 55 Zhenjiang 50</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending upwards, and the situation is tightening due to the silver tax issue. Market participants are reacting strongly, and short positions are being covered on a large scale. However, some are also selling heavily during the price increase. There is intense competition between the long and short sides. Nevertheless, spot cotton trading remains slow, and factory demand is weak.</p>
<p>(Future Cotton Prices Rise by 0.35 Yuan) At the opening of the future cotton market, prices also rose due to the silver tax, and buying sentiment was strong. Short sellers covered, and prices for all months increased by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan.

<h3 id="e216">The Bond Market in the Storm <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the government implementing taxes on silver exports, the outflow of cash could be reduced, and government finances could achieve a balanced budget. Confidence strengthened, but then rumors resurfaced, and confidence weakened again. The bond market environment is in a precarious state, so every rise is weak. However, if the Fifth Plenary Session opens as scheduled, then all problems should be easily solved. The day started with a promising trend. Buying of the fifth issue was most active at the opening, and both floor traders and retail investors were mostly buying rather than selling. Because silver taxation would strengthen government finances, bullish opportunities arose, and the market saw a surge in buying, with prices rising across the board, generally by four or five jiao. Later, absurd rumors suddenly emerged, dampening sentiment, and prices immediately fell back by one to four jiao. In the afternoon opening and closing sessions, rumors of martial law in a certain area spread, and floor bulls rushed to sell, with prices falling by two or three jiao in each session. Rumors continued unabated, and the market price was about to enter a state of chaotic fluctuation. The final result of yesterday's market price was a drop of five fen to three or four jiao, with only one or two types slightly better by about one jiao. The total volume of transactions was 15,620,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan; trading unit: 100 yuan; stock unit: 1 share).</p>

<h3 id="e217">Flour and Wheat Also Rise Due to Silver Tax <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months saw increases. Although there was a period of fluctuation in the middle, the result was still an increase. This was because the silver tax move had already raised public sentiment. Buying by merchants and bulls, and short covering, led to sudden spikes in all months. The forward months were particularly sought after by merchants and were especially strong. At the morning opening, the forward months had already risen by four or five fen, and the near months by one or two fen. Later, the market softened as factory shorts sold. In the afternoon, there was another period of fluctuation, with the final closing prices being up 1.75 fen for the current month, 2.25 fen for the next month, 4 fen for December, 5.25 fen for January, and 5.25 fen for February.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market was entirely dominated by buying. The expectation of positive news was particularly strong. Due to the silver tax, although foreign wheat was quoted at a slightly lower price of six jiao, the market still saw increases. Short covering and gradual buying in both near and distant months caused a strong upward trend. Before noon, the near months soared by 1.34 jiao, and the distant months rose by 1.7 jiao. Later, as the flour market softened slightly, large bulls closed their positions, and the market stabilized slightly. The closing prices were up one jiao for October, 1.1 fen for November, 1.2 jiao for December, January, and February, and the opening price for March was 3.83 yuan, the first transaction for the association. The spot wheat factories are holding firm, and the owners are quoting high prices. The opening price at the car terminal is 3.37 yuan, and the market is still watching for further developments.</p>

<h3 id="e218">120,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Newly Arrived <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>丨丨Market Prices Also Rise by Two Jiao丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign white rice generally trended upwards. Due to the gradual depletion of stocks in the market recently and the limited number of arrivals, the low prices of foreign rice futures led to a surge in market sentiment. Speculators and hoarders, coupled with the implementation of the silver tax, which is bound to raise prices, caused foreign rice to rise sharply by two jiao, and white rice by varying amounts from a few fen to more than a jiao. The entire city handled 1,200 bags of white rice and 3,795 bags of foreign rice from this street, and 726 bags of white rice and 600 bags of foreign rice from the interior. The sharp rise of two jiao in foreign rice was not entirely due to the silver tax. It was mainly because the two ships originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of last week were delayed en route for several days. The floating stocks in the market were depleted, and the owners hoarded their goods, which, coupled with the silver issue, led to a sharp rise of two jiao. The futures market for October opened at 300 tons, with initial sales in the morning at 4.75 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the activity in the spot rice market, the price jumped up by one jiao to 4.85 yuan. The two ships of foreign rice, with no fixed arrival date, arrived completely yesterday. However, they will need to be unloaded and go through customs inspection procedures, so the goods will not be available for delivery for at least three to five days. These two ships are the Talay Sima La, carrying 50,000 bags of Italian rice, and the Milly Mara, carrying about 70,000 bags of rice, totaling about 120,000 bags. However, this cargo was originally sold in September and will mostly be used to cover futures contracts. Therefore, although the number of arrivals is large, there is not a large floating stock in the market.</p>

The market for pearl tea and Gongxi tea is already brewing. However, the most important Zhenmei green tea has seen few transactions, although many telegrams have been sent by various merchants.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Pitying a Lost Girl Peeking Through the Door; Cherishing Jade and Visiting a Poor Family to Hear of Hardships</p>
<p>Li Shilian asked: "Is there Western food here?" The waiter replied: "Yes! Many division commanders and brigade commanders from outside invite guests here. Foreigners who come to Xi'an always stay here because we specialize in Western food. I don't see anything special about Germans eating Western food, but they drink too much beer. They drink beer like water, a whole glass at a time, and they don't drink tea all day." Zhang Jiefu heard that Germans drink beer like that, and his throat vibrated, and he stretched his neck, as if he had already swallowed a mouthful of phlegm. Cheng Zhiqian looked clearly into the lighted rooms from outside the window, and couldn't help but smile secretly. Turning his head, he saw a Westerner typing at a table in a small courtyard across the way, the typewriter rattling, and he didn't even look up. This was probably the German that Zhang Jiefu was talking about. He thought, what is this German doing here? I'll have to investigate tomorrow. Cheng Zhiqian wandered under the eaves for a long time, and then he added two things to worry about. After breakfast the next morning, he saw two Caucasians testing the engine of a car in the large open courtyard, making a loud noise, so he took the opportunity to come out and wanted to talk to the Caucasians. Just then, the waiter brought in a woman with bound feet. She walked holding the door frame, smiling and whispering, "Is it that room?" Saying that, she looked back. And shouted, "Come on! Didn't you want to see the foreign houses? Come on!" He shouted several times in a row, and a girl of sixteen or seventeen years old walked in from outside the courtyard door. As soon as she saw someone, she lowered her head, held the door, and hesitated to enter. The waiter said, "It doesn't matter, just go in. There are foreign-style cave dwellings built in the back, and there are large foreign buildings in the front. You can see them all." The girl probably also had a sense of curiosity. After the waiter boasted like this, she entered the door. (40)</p>
<h3 id="e221">New Suggestions for the Double Ninth Festival <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— By Qifenglou Master</p>
<p>Social customs, once established for a long time, become deeply entrenched and difficult to reform in a short period of time! The "moon viewing" and eating "moon cakes" of the Mid-Autumn Festival have already passed with much fanfare. Now that the Double Ninth Festival has arrived, everyone remembers the "mountain climbing" and eating "Double Ninth cakes." However, having witnessed the current situation, I would like to offer some small suggestions for these two activities. Although it involves games, it does not hum the slogan "Entertainment should not forget saving the country," so I think it is harmless.</p>
<p>▲ Change Mountain Climbing to Airplane Riding The story of mountain climbing is that Huan Jing had a disaster on the ninth day of the Double Ninth Festival, and Fei Changfang ordered his whole family to wear dogwood pouches and climb the mountain to avoid the disaster, thus escaping the misfortune. However, now looking around the country, it can be said that disasters and famines are everywhere, and thorns fill the path. Even the mountaintops and watersides may be affected! Therefore, the only way to avoid disaster is to take an airplane and fly straight into the clouds, soaring in space, or perhaps avoid it by one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>▲ Eating Cake Should Be Changed to Eating饼 "Liu Lang dared not write the word cake, falsely bearing the name of a great poet," this refers to the story of Liu Mengde writing poetry on the Double Ninth Festival. As for when the eating of Double Ninth cake began, I am sorry that I cannot answer. However, every year on the Double Ninth Festival, cake is eaten every year, and as a result, the current social situation has become so terrible! In this sluggish economy, why not change the pattern this year and eat cake instead? Because there is only the saying "too cake," but never "cake cake," and cake is round, which can also be said to imply a sense of completeness. Eating it may give the hope that incomplete things will be reunited.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Snippets <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— (Meixue)</p>
<p>The spirit of resisting goods has weakened, and imported shark fins have majestically ascended to the table. A gourmet said: "The country is what I love, and shark fins are also what I love. The two cannot be had at the same time, so I will give up the country and take the shark fins."</p>
<h3 id="e223">On a Pedal Boat <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>I sat on a pedal boat to go to a relative's house in the interior, which gave me endless thoughts.</p>
<p>It is a small wooden boat, with a green canopy on top and pointed ends. The boatman uses oars to stir the water waves, and then the small boat gradually moves forward. This is the "pedal boat" that is about to be eliminated but has not been eliminated in the interior.</p>
<p>It is said that the business of pedal boats was still very good twenty or thirty years ago. Later, the shipping industry gradually flourished, so people enjoyed a higher level of life and everyone liked to take steamers instead of welcoming the pedal boats. Therefore, the passengers in the boat are still some old people, and farmers and peasant women who like to save a few cents. Young lads are reluctant to take this pedal boat unless they have no other choice. Therefore, the owners of the pedal boats have suffered a blow in their lives and gradually feel the "difficulty of living."</p>
<p>"That's right, material culture is advancing day by day, pedal boats have overthrown sailboats, and steamers have overthrown pedal boats. It seems that the elimination of pedal boats is a certain truth," said an old passenger. "But, I think: after the elimination, how will the lives of the general boatmen be solved? Isn't this going to become a problem?"</p>
<p>Now, the people who run pedal boats have also risen up to fight. They have also installed machines on the boats, called "machine pedal boats." Of course, using machines to drive is indeed much faster, but the number of pedal boats in the interior that can afford to install machines is really as rare as stars in the morning. So many pedal boats that cannot afford to install machines are inevitably eliminated in the end.</p>
<p>Alas, I sat on a pedal boat to go to a relative's house in the interior, which gave me endless thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Self-Expression <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Tongchu</p>
<p>Generally, people say that children's self-expression is the strongest. In fact, if you examine the behavior of adults, their self-expression is no less than that of children. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>▲ Brother Old K He is my colleague, and because his face is just like the Old K on the playing card, he is called Brother Old K. He claims to like watching movies very much. He comes back at 11:30 every night, walking so hard that the floorboards almost jump up, and everyone is awakened from their sleep. Then he criticizes how the film is in terms of consciousness, and at the same time passes the brochure to everyone. However, according to several colleagues, the brochure was obtained when he was seen passing the theater and going in to get it. He also likes to eat candy. While chewing, he gesticulates in front of you. However, the total amount he eats in a day is only what you see.</p>
<p>▲ Li Er Probably he is the second child in his family, so his old classmates call him Li Er. As soon as he sees you on the road, he rattles on and on about his triumphant events, over and over again. When you impatiently want to say goodbye, he turns to other things. Sometimes he deliberately calls a rickshaw and scolds the driver before sending him away. Sometimes he steps into a food company and tastes some of this and some of that. As a result, he doesn't make any deals. These are all the tricks he uses to show you.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Jin Mr. Jin was an old colleague of mine when I worked at a certain school. He was really like a child. Once, he ran from a long way away, holding a Tangram set that he made by hand, and asked me to introduce him and the many colleagues here to it. After I introduced him, he said how difficult it was to make the Tangram set, how fun it was, like a treasure. As he spoke, he played it again. The colleagues were all laughing behind his back, because that thing really wasn't that surprisingly fun.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Records of Pervasive Incense <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Now this part is already so dilapidated that it can no longer be used for anything. And the Shanhai Pass, which was originally used to isolate us, is opened like a door. I am afraid that after a few decades or hundreds of years, people will gradually forget the original intention of the ancient emperors to build this Great Wall, until they forget it completely!"</p>
<p>Indeed, the Great Wall is gradually collapsing, especially near Shanhai Pass, collapsing exceptionally quickly, revealing a large gap; the track of the Jingfeng Railway passes through this gap very generously. As for the many materials that have collapsed? It must have taken a lot of financial resources to collect them in the past. Now, because no one is in charge, as soon as it collapses, it is taken by nearby residents as materials for building houses; even if it has not collapsed, some people steal it and dismantle it, and move it back to their own homes. It is no wonder that the Empress Dowager was filled with emotion about such a valuable ancient building being allowed to be destroyed and collapsed!</p>
<p>Now, the place where we are standing is the boundary line between the Chinese mainland and the three northeastern provinces. As long as we cross the Great Wall, the outside is the place where our ancestors entered the Central Plains and rose to power. I don't know what the Empress Dowager felt in her heart when she arrived at this place? She seemed to be most fascinated by the clear water of the Liaodong Bay. For two thousand years, the seawater here has washed the end of the Great Wall day and night, causing it to collapse automatically, gradually dying like an old man.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager slowly moved her eyes, which were fixed on the seawater, to the several mountain peaks above; these mountain peaks were like prisoners who had been sentenced to imprisonment, chained by people for a long time, and their shackles were the Great Wall. (150)</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<p>— (Yingdai)</p>
<p>A Prolific Centenarian</p>
<p>In the area of ​​Bergrant, there was a prolific centenarian who had thirty-four sons, but recently he passed away, and his age was one hundred and twenty-two years. In his life, he had married four times, so there were thirty-four men and women under his knees. However, the hall full of children did not agree with him, so in such a big family, only one grandson was by his bed when he died. Because in his later years, the children died, separated, and only lived with that grandson.</p>
<p>Lenin's Former Residence</p>
<p>When Lenin is mentioned, perhaps everyone knows that he was a great Soviet revolutionary, and the Russians respect Lenin just like we respect Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the area of ​​Samara, there is a house that was Lenin's former residence. He lived inside from 1890 to 1893. Now this house has been set up by the government as a library on the lower floor, and Lenin's relics are displayed on the upper floor. Soviet people, regardless of distance, come in droves every day to see the former residence of the leader.</p>
<p>A Beggar's Harvest</p>
<p>Madrid is the capital of Spain. The number of beggars there is unmatched elsewhere. According to official statistics, the city is full of beggars, 300,000 people a year, and they can beg for six million pounds, which are all accumulated from small amounts. Because it is too easy to get money in Spain, all the beggars are very rich. Among the beggars, some even wear silk shirts and gold watches. Beggars with such luxury may have opened a new record in the history of beggars around the world, which is unexpected by anyone!</p>
<p>The Decline of the Gambling City</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is a famous French city, and the gambling there is known throughout the world. The amount of gambling is huge, and millions of gold coins can be made in one night, which is really shocking to hear. However, since the world started to experience economic panic, the famous gambling city of Monte Carlo has also changed, and its image is declining day by day. Clubs are closing one after another, and nineteen out of ten casinos are closed, with signs of disintegration. In the past, ordinary poor boys could not even think of going to Monte Carlo and entering the grand and magnificent casinos. However, in order to save this crisis, starting from November 1st, all travelers, anyone, can enter the casino for free gambling without having to buy tickets.</p>
<p>The Russian Emperor's Summer Palace</p>
<p>Peterhof Palace is very close to Leningrad and is a famous Russian palace. The magnificence of the architecture and the richness of the decoration are unmatched, and it is indeed the crystallization of art. Now, it has been completely renovated under the leadership of the Leningrad City Council. The palace was originally built by Peter the Great, and it was extremely luxurious. All the decorations and embellishments that could be bought with money were in the palace, without exception. In the past, the emperors of Russia used it as a summer palace. After the revolution, it was converted into a museum. During the war, the Bolsheviks sent troops to guard it to prevent the destruction of this historical building, so it was able to avoid any damage, because the preparations at that time were thorough!</p>
<p>Live Fish in the Rain</p>
<p>It may be an unheard of thing to have live fish in the rain? But according to news recently received from Budapest, it is said that on a certain day in the area of ​​Darber, Hungary, many fresh fish fell down when it rained. In a storm, millions of small fish were mixed in the raindrops and fell to the ground. In a short time, the ground was full of small fish. This incident has attracted a lot of attention, and as a result, the fallen fish were sent to the Natural History Museum in Budapest for research.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Issue</p>
<p>Voices of the Telecommunications Industry</p>
<h3 id="e227">Worship Domestic Products <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Lvb冰</p>
<p>The public advocates domestic products, newspapers promote domestic products, domestic product year, domestic product bargains, national salvation and survival depend on domestic products.</p>
<p>To make the society widely purchase domestic goods, on the one hand, a detailed investigation of domestic production should be carried out, and on the other hand, manufacturing should be encouraged. Although domestic products are abundant and raw materials are abundant, the industry is not thriving and there are not many products. Even if you want to use domestic products to suppress foreign goods, the result is still practically impossible. Leaving aside other things, let's talk about telecommunications.</p>
<p>Telecommunications has a history of more than fifty years since its establishment. A glimpse of telecommunications machinery shows that most of them are imported. They come with machines, we go with currency, and the amount of leakage is considerable every year. As for line materials, copper wires and iron wires cannot be made domestically, which is of course not to be mentioned. Our country is known for producing porcelain, but insulators are magnetic materials. They have been repeatedly imitated in Jingdezhen, but due to cost concerns, they have not been fully improved for practical use. The so-called real domestic products are probably only the wooden poles along the line. Only a few remain, which is a pity to say.</p>
<p>People engaged in the telecommunications industry, and those who have interacted with reporters, often hear their opinions, and all have a psychology of worshiping domestic products. However, in the past, the Ministry of Communications rarely advocated machinery manufacturing in a practical way, and also rarely conducted detailed investigations on domestic products that could be applied to telecommunications. Individuals, even if they have talent and wisdom, are always troubled by the lack of testing equipment and the weakness of economic strength. In the end, they can only sigh at the ocean. Therefore, the domestic products used in telecommunications are still very few to this day.</p>
<p>The current Ministry of Communications is vigorously promoting domestic products. It has already issued orders to its subordinates to use domestic products, and now it has issued orders to its subordinates to investigate domestic production. The investigation will collect all kinds of domestic materials suitable for telecommunications, so that nothing is missed. In this way, if domestic goods can be used to compensate for the future of telecommunications, even if the cost increases slightly, it will abandon imports and use domestic products. As for manufacturing, it is especially hoped that it will cooperate with technical experts in the industrial and commercial sectors to put telecommunications materials on the road to self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>People in society, all sectors of industry and commerce, those who have made contributions to domestic telecommunications materials, and those who have studied self-made telecommunications materials, are looking forward to the popularization of domestic products and are welcomed by the telecommunications industry, then it is time to rise up upon hearing the news!</p>
<h3 id="e228">One of the New Constructions for the Convenience of Public Communication: The Establishment of Station Postal and Telegraph Agencies <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Opened First</p>
<p>Every time we arrive at various train stations, we see crowds of travelers, men, women, old, and young, in countless numbers. Among these groups of travelers, there must be quite a few who need to send telegrams or letters urgently. However, if we observe train stations across the country, which station has the facilities to conveniently send telegrams or letters? Although there are railway telegraph offices in stations, they do not have a wired connection with the local telegraph bureau. They are specifically established to handle station affairs. In places where telegraph bureaus already exist, they are restricted by the regulations of the telegraph bureau from accepting domestic telegrams from travelers. Therefore, travelers at train stations who have urgent matters and want to send telegrams or letters, except for ordinary letters that can be dropped into mailboxes, have to find the local telegraph or post office, which are mostly far from the station. This is very inconvenient for travelers at train stations! To make up for this shortcoming and for the convenience of travelers at general stations, the transportation authorities recently negotiated a cooperative method with the Railway Department, resulting in the creation of "Station Postal and Telegraph Agencies." Now, I will briefly describe the contents of the station postal and telegraph agencies to the readers:</p>
<p>1.  Station postal and telegraph agencies are attached to the most suitable locations within various stations;</p>
<p>2.  The affairs of station postal and telegraph agencies are handled by the Railway Bureau on behalf of the telegraph and post offices, with designated personnel from the Railway Bureau handling the work concurrently;</p>
<p>3.  The business hours of station postal and telegraph agencies are the same as the usual business hours of the stations where they are located.</p>
<p>4.  The duties of station postal and telegraph agencies are defined as follows: (A) Selling stamps, accepting various ordinary, registered, express, and airmail items, and sealing and dispatching outgoing mail packages. (B) Receiving domestic or Hong Kong and Macau telegrams from travelers and the public, and delivering incoming domestic and international telegrams (limited to telegrams delivered to passengers on trains and telegrams received by stations without telegraph bureaus).</p>
<p>5.  Postage and quotations are charged according to the regulations of the post and telegraph offices, without any additional fees.</p>
<p>6.  Important railway stations are connected to local telegraph bureaus by wires. Where there is a large volume of telegram traffic, Morse key and sounder or teleprinters are used. In other places, telephone sets are installed, and telegrams are transmitted by telephone, or the telegraph bureau is notified to send someone to collect them (limited to particularly lengthy official military telegrams and foreign language telegrams that are prone to errors, or when the Railway Bureau's own telegraph services are particularly busy).</p>
<p>The above is a general description of the internal organization of station postal and telegraph agencies. If all stations have these postal and telegraph agencies, then travelers at the stations can avoid the hassle of running around to find places to send telegrams and letters when they have urgent matters. However, these station postal and telegraph agencies are still in their initial stages. The transportation and railway authorities have decided to first pilot them at the Shanghai North Station, Shanghai South Station, Nanjing Xiaguan, Hangzhou City Station, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Jiaxing on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines. After achieving significant results, they will be expanded to stations on various lines throughout the country.</p>
<p>In recent years, the transportation authorities have held a very ambitious vision. On the one hand, based on the principle of commercializing state-owned enterprises, they have worked hard to improve and innovate, with all facilities and reforms being based on the premise of benefiting the people and aiming for the widespread development of the industry. On the other hand, with a spirit of cooperation, they first seek close liaison between their own postal, telecommunications, and aviation sectors, and then further liaise with other state-owned enterprises, to integrate the entire transportation industry and increase the efficiency of information dissemination. Therefore, the establishment of such station postal and telegraph agencies through the cooperation of the transportation and railway departments is not only for the convenience of the people, but also has a significant relationship to the transmission of information and the consolidation of national defense in the future. I hope that both parties will work hard to promote this, so that these station postal and telegraph agencies will be widespread throughout the country's stations in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Let's look at our eastern neighbor, Japan. Their train stations and post offices have very close communication links, and their telecommunications regulations clearly stipulate that a separate room must be set aside in each train station for communication between the train station and the post office. It can be seen that the work of this kind of communication link is very important. At a time when the country's situation is frequently in danger and foreign troubles are imminent, we should promote its success with the spirit of "cooperation" that President Wang has instructed us in this important communication work.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Remote Control Telephone Cables Used by Broadcasting Radio Stations (1) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>The rapid advancement of broadcasting in modern countries has increased the need for highly efficient remote control telephone cables in terms of design and manufacturing. The design of this type of telephone cable must be suitable for the spoken language of broadcasting, ensuring accurate pronunciation, and must also achieve clear and pure results when broadcasting various types of music, without reducing or distorting the sound. When radio engineers encounter this type of problem, they can use the existing long-distance telephone cables of the telephone bureau to create a remote control network, connecting one broadcasting station with other broadcasting stations in different locations, so that the music programs of each station can be broadcast to each other; or they can bury dedicated remote control telephone cables, directly connecting the music room with the broadcasting station, so that the programs emitted in the broadcasting music room can be broadcast.</p>
<p>When selecting or designing the core wire of a remote control telephone cable, there are two important properties that must be paid attention to: (1) The core wire must be able to transmit every note in the music, so that there is extremely accurate sound; in other words, it must have a full and wide frequency range (Wide Frequency Range) that is sufficient to match the sound wave frequency on the instrument, so that even the highest notes can be accurately transmitted; (2) The core wire must not be affected by attenuation when transmitting various frequencies, that is, the various transmission frequencies should not change regardless of the amplitude used. Furthermore, this core wire must not be affected by the induction of other nearby lines or strong lines; the result of the induction, whether it is caused by telephone calls, telegraph signals, or strong currents of electricity, can cause the broadcast music program to become unclear or uneven.</p>
<p>Using overhead wires for remote control circuits can also achieve a wide frequency band without discovering attenuation phenomena, because overhead wires have their own characteristics and can transmit high frequencies without attenuation problems. However, the facts tell us that when remote control lines use overhead wires, they are too obviously affected by the outside world. For example, lightning in the atmosphere or strong currents from nearby power lines can cause great damage to this type of non-packaged remote control line. For this reason, the remote control lines used by broadcasting stations must be cables, because their core wires are wrapped in metal (Metallic Shield), which can isolate the induction of the outside world. However, ordinary long-distance telephone cables, which must use Loading Coil to avoid attenuation of the conversation, cannot be used as remote control lines for broadcasting stations because their frequency band is relatively too small and does not have the ability to transmit the sound waves of the broadcast. The frequency in the metal circuit in ordinary two-wire circuit long-distance telephone cables is only 2,700 cycles per second (P.P.S; or Period Per Second), and the frequency in the phantom circuit is slightly higher, but only 3,500 cycles per second. Modern telephone cables have been improved several times due to the need for higher frequencies for communication efficiency, and all frequencies have been improved to 3,400 cycles per second in the metal circuit and 4,300 cycles per second in the phantom circuit. However, at this level, there is still a long way to go to use it as a remote control line to transmit music programs. The latest type of telephone cable used as a remote control line to transmit piano and violin notes should have a frequency of 10,000 cycles per second, and the circuit must be equipped with appropriate load coils for satisfactory results.</p>
<h3 id="e230">On Telegraph Rates <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The level of telegraph rates is a major issue in the history of a country's transportation. If the price is too high, it is not affordable for the economic capacity of the general public, resulting in very few beneficiaries, which violates the purpose of state-owned enterprises. If the price is too low, it is not acceptable for the value of the work of the enterprise itself, leading to unsustainable operations, which is not the principle of commercial policy. How to make the price appropriate, taking the best and discarding the worst? On the one hand, we should investigate the national economic capacity, and on the other hand, base it on the value of the enterprise itself. There is much room for discussion and research in weighing the gains and losses. European and American countries attach great importance to the issue of telegraph rates and often have organizations of rate committees to conduct research. The formulation of international rates is a focal point of discussion at international telecommunications conferences. This is because the telecommunications industry has a great impact on a country's economy, politics, and culture, and pricing requires careful and thorough consideration.</p>
<p>Commentators often criticize China's telegraph rates as being higher than those of other countries. However, according to surveys and statistics (see the comparison of telegraph rates in various countries and China in the 18th issue of this publication), Germany, Belgium, the United States, and other countries all have higher rates per word for Chinese telegrams than China. In terms of the lowest price per telegram, almost all countries except Japan have higher rates than China. If we consider the ratio of area to price, China has the largest area and the cheapest fees. Therefore, the claim that China's rates are too high is not a sound argument.</p>
<p>Commentators also say that the current domestic rates are not affordable for the economic capacity of the general public. This statement is reasonable, but according to the history of domestic rates, it is not accurate. The following is a list of domestic telegraph rates over the years:</p>
<p>Comparison of Domestic Telegraph Rates Over the Years</p>
<p>Chinese Language        Plain Language          Chinese Cipher or Foreign Language      Effective Date        Remarks</p>
<p>Within Province   Between Provinces      Within Province   Between Provinces</p>
<p>10 cents       Add 2 cents per province        20 cents       Add 4 cents per province        From August of the 20th year of the Guangxu reign</p>
<p>10 cents       Add 3 cents per province        20 cents       Add 6 cents per province        From January of the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign</p>
<p>8 cents        Add 2.4 cents per province      16 cents       Add 4.8 cents per province      From January of the 1st year of the Xuantong reign        The above were set by the Postal and Communications Department of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>6 cents        12 cents        9 cents        18 cents        From the 1st year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>8 cents        15 cents        16 cents        30 cents        From November of the 11th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>6 cents        12 cents        9 cents        18 cents        From January of the 12th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>7 cents        14 cents        11 cents        22 cents        From February of the 16th year of the Republic of China        The above were set by the Ministry of Communications of the Beijing government</p>
<p>8 cents        16 cents        16 cents        32 cents        From September of the 16th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>10 cents       10 cents        20 cents        20 cents        From October 10 of the 17th year of the Republic of China        The above were set by the Ministry of Communications of the National Government</p>
<p>Looking at the table on the right, from August of the 20th year of the Guangxu reign to the 3rd year of the Xuantong reign, a progressive system of adding fees based on the number of provinces was adopted, with the highest rate being 40 cents per word. From the 1st year of the Republic of China to October 9 of the 17th year, a system of rates within and between provinces was adopted, with the highest rate being 8 cents within the province and 16 cents between provinces. From October 10 of the 17th year, a unified system was adopted, with a flat rate of 10 cents regardless of whether it was within or between provinces. This rate was already cheaper than the rates of previous years. Since January of the 22nd year, the names and addresses of recipients of domestic Chinese telegrams within 15 characters have been calculated as 5 characters uniformly, and express telegrams have been reduced to twice the normal rate. This method is the cheapest compared to the rates of any previous era, and the current standards for material costs, the value of purchasing equipment, and the needs of employee salaries are not as high as in any previous era. The people of the past 50 years have been able to afford the higher rates of previous years, which has already been proven by facts. Therefore, according to the rates of previous years, the claim that the current rates are too high is not a factual statement.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Ministry of Communications, since the implementation of the unified rate in the 17th year, the annual operating loss has been approximately 1.1 million yuan. Since the revision of the method for calculating recipient names and addresses this year, the annual loss is approximately 480,000 yuan. Under such a large amount of sacrifice and in the extremely difficult economic situation of the telecommunications administration, some people at the telecommunications administration conference last month, in view of the repeated price increases of the postal service and railways in recent years, advocated restoring the system of rates within and between provinces to provide relief. However, the general assembly decided that the rate issue should be addressed by streamlining operations and facilitating the public, and that the current rates should be maintained. The intention is that if there are possibilities for reducing expenses in the telecommunications administration and there are hopes for expanding telecommunications services, they should be done as much as possible, and that they are unwilling to change the current telegraph rates and increase the burden on the public. This spirit of working hard to improve and facilitate the public is truly commendable!</p>
<h3 id="e231">Commentary on the Case of the Yongli and Yongzeng Joint Silver Firms in Tianjin Illegally Establishing Radio Stations <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Di You</p>
<p>(The process of solving the case) Initially, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications received a secret report that the Yongli and Yongzeng joint silver firms in Tianjin had illegally established a radio station on the building at 51 Yaohua Lane in the British Concession to communicate with Shanghai. The ministry immediately secretly instructed the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, the Radio Station, and the affiliated organizations of the Telephone Bureau to cooperate closely in the investigation. The investigation concluded that the location of the two silver firms' illegally established radio station was indeed at the aforementioned location. They then, together with the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital, consulted the British Municipal Council and obtained a search warrant to conduct a search. When they first entered, they saw nothing except two telephones. After a thorough search, they found a receiver, charger, codebook, telegraph drafts, and other parts in the dressing table. They also arrested a telegraph operator and a partner of the two silver firms on the spot. They also carefully checked the electrical wiring in the entire room, which was connected to the ceiling. When they sawed open the ceiling, they found a transmitter, two transformers, a wave meter, and a telegraph key. The British Municipal Council then extradited all the stolen goods and criminals to the Public Security Bureau for trial in court.</p>
<p>(Subsequent disposal) After the event, the Ministry of Communications recognized that various parties had assisted greatly in solving the case of the two silver firms illegally establishing a radio station. In order to reward the meritorious and facilitate future work, the ministry specially awarded a first-class medal each to the directors of the Telegraph and Telephone Bureaus, the chief engineer of the Radio Station, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and the director of the Police Department of the British Municipal Council. The hard-working telegraph personnel from the two bureaus and stations were each given bonuses. In addition, a large sum of money was allocated to the Tianjin Public Security Bureau and the Police Department to be distributed to the police officers. The criminal part of the case has been formally prosecuted by the Tianjin Local Court Prosecutor's Office for theft, and the part of the case involving infringement of telegraph business has been carefully calculated by the Telegraph Bureau and attached to the private prosecution. The main criminal in the case, the manager of the Yongli and Yongzeng joint silver firms, fled in fear of punishment after the incident and has disappeared without a trace. An order has been issued to strictly arrest him and bring him to justice. Furthermore, since the two silver firms used the city telephone system to transmit telegrams between the two silver firms and the illegally established radio station, the Tianjin Telephone Bureau has been ordered to remove all the telephones installed by the two silver firms as a warning to those who use state-owned telephones for illegal communication. Furthermore, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications believe that illegally established radio stations have been discovered in Tianjin in recent years, which has greatly affected the future of telecommunications administration. In order to thoroughly eliminate them, advertisements have been placed in major newspapers in Tianjin, offering rewards for reporting illegal radio stations.</p>
<p>(Conclusion) Article 3 of the Telecommunications Regulations states: "The following telecommunications (omitted) may be established by local governments, public or private organizations, or individuals after approval by the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Communications, or other authorized agencies." Therefore, it is not permitted by the Telecommunications Regulations to establish a radio station privately without the approval of the competent authority. Furthermore, this case involves as many as eight criminals, and the illegal radio station has engaged in eavesdropping on news telegrams from various places and soliciting commercial telegrams for profit. Considering the circumstances, it is different from other cases of illegally established telecommunications. The transmission of radio waves relies on radio waves, so those who illegally establish radio stations can listen to the radio waves and telegrams emitted by public radio stations in addition to private communication. Considering that electricity should be considered a thing under Article 340, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, there is no doubt that it constitutes the crime of organized theft under the Criminal Law. Therefore, the Tianjin Prosecutor's Office's public prosecution for theft is a strict and just measure. Furthermore, in recent years, the trend of illegally establishing radio stations for secret communication has been rampant, and the harm it causes is great. The greater harm is that it affects local public order, and the lesser harm is that it disrupts the financial market, and the harm to state-owned telecommunications is particularly significant. However, although this type of illegally established radio station has been repeatedly cracked down on by the Ministry of Communications, criminals value profits over the law and still dare to try it, stubbornly unaware of the warning. The reasons for this are that wireless radio talent, equipment, and materials are easy to obtain, and the punishment regulations are not strict enough to warn the criminals. Therefore, the fundamental solution is that the Ministry of Communications should find ways to unify and manage wireless radio talent, materials, and equipment, so that those who illegally establish radio stations lose their dependence. On the other hand, the Ministry of Communications should submit a request to the Executive Yuan to consult the Legislative Yuan to add a special article to the draft revision of the Criminal Law, imposing severe penalties on those who illegally establish radio stations, illegally communicate, and use them. The so-called "ruling a chaotic country requires severe punishments" is probably the same. Perhaps the villains will know to restrain themselves. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications is planning to increase the penalties for the latter, and for the sake of maintaining our country's wireless telecommunications industry, which is just beginning, it is necessary to realize it as soon as possible!</p>

<p>— Guo Song</p>
<p>丨丨The Result of Resolving the Public Telephone Problem丨丨</p>
<p>In the 19th issue of this publication, Mr. Lü Bing raised the issue of public telephones for public discussion, and inferred that the reason why public telephones have not been promoted in our country is because (A) the problem of use and (B) the problem of installation have not been properly resolved, so it is appropriate to establish the principle of both facilitating the public and considering business. It has been found that public telephones have been installed in various prosperous cities in our country, either operated by the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications or managed by merchants. However, because there are no guidelines, the business regulations and management methods established in various places are inconsistent and mostly inappropriate. It is not enough to arouse the public's interest in sending telegrams? The lack of development of public telephones is the main reason. Now, the Ministry of Communications has formulated one type of "General Rules for the Operation of Public Telephones by the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications" and one type of "General Rules for the Ministry of Communications to Recruit Merchants to Manage Public Telephones", which have been announced and implemented on September 22 of this year. The former is to solve the problem of use, and the latter is to solve the problem of installation. With these fixed general rules to comply with, the problem of public telephones has been resolved.</p>
<p>It has been found that the installation of public telephones is more important than that of private telephones. Why? Private telephones only provide calls for individuals or a store or an organization, and the scope is very small; public telephones provide calls for all citizens, and the need is greater. Moreover, at a time when the telephone business in our country is not yet developed, it is necessary to promote the business so that the public is happy to use it and develop the habit of calling, and then the business can be developed.</p>
<p>The purpose of the two general rules announced by the Ministry of Communications is entirely for the convenience of the public. Although its initial implementation has indeed been affected by the problems of (A) use and (B) installation mentioned by Mr. Lü Bing, it does not harm the business. It is not without loss, but in line with the principle of commercializing state-owned enterprises and making them more public, public telephones will never be ignored due to temporary minor losses. Moreover, once public telephones are developed, the public will feel the convenience and need for sending telegrams, which in turn can promote the popularity of private telephones?</p>
<p>When we are wandering around the streets and have something important to tell someone or an organization, we often suffer from the inability to communicate, or we are often rejected when we go to various businesses to borrow telephones (which is actually reasonable), resulting in a feeling of being unable to move forward or backward and having no one to tell. Now that the general rules for public telephones have been announced, we will see the installation of public telephones in prosperous areas of the city. Each time, you only need to pay a toll fee of 3 to 5 cents of silver to enjoy the convenience of calling. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's farmer policy said, "Those who till the land should have their own land." After the public telephone problem of the Ministry of Communications is resolved, isn't it "those who speak should have their own electricity"?</p>
<h3 id="e233">Several Small Hurdles to Sending Telegrams (Continued) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>In the previous two issues, twelve ways to save money have already been discussed. Now, let's talk about how to make telegrams fast and accurate:</p>
<p>(1) Urgent Telegrams: Urgent telegrams are like special appointments at a hospital outpatient clinic. The telegraph office sends such telegrams immediately upon receipt, which is much faster than ordinary telegrams. Although the fee is doubled, people don't care about a dollar or two when there are extremely urgent matters, as long as the telegram arrives quickly. Therefore, merchants mostly send urgent telegrams for market information so that it arrives instantly and they can make various important transactions. Ordinary private individuals may also send urgent telegrams if there are the most urgent matters so that the recipient can receive it immediately.</p>
<p>(2) Using the Telephone to Transmit Telegrams: The most time-consuming and laborious part of sending a telegram is that the sender must send the telegram to the telegraph office by messenger or in person. This process takes at least five minutes, and sometimes dozens of minutes. After the telegraph office receives the telegram, the time it takes to transmit it from station A to station B, or then to station C, is relatively short. However, when station B or C dispatches a messenger for delivery after receiving the telegram, it takes a considerable amount of time again. Therefore, if senders and receivers want to speed up the telegram and save the time of dispatching messengers, it is best to use a local telephone to transmit the telegram to the telegraph office over the phone, which is the most convenient. When sending a telegram, just inform the telegraph office of the text over the phone, and the telegraph office will send it immediately. When receiving a telegram, the telegraph office transmits the text to the recipient. In this way, both parties save the procedure and time of dispatching messengers, and each telegram can be faster by at least ten or twenty minutes, or even one or two hours. This is such an important hurdle!</p>
<p>(3) Installing Dedicated Line Telegraph and Telephone Machines: Merchants with a large volume of telegram traffic often use local telephones to transmit telegrams. However, because the telegraph office or their own telephone is occupied, delays are inevitable. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has come up with a good solution, which is to allow merchants to apply to the telegraph office to install dedicated lines and rent telegraph machines, or to rent dedicated telephone lines and telephones from the local telephone bureau, so that they can transmit telegrams to the telegraph office via dedicated lines without any delay. Detailed procedures can be obtained from the telegraph office or our newspaper.</p>
<p>(4) Forwarding Telegrams: If the sender is unsure of the recipient's location, such as when traveling to various places on official business or for leisure, it is difficult to determine where the recipient is when sending the telegram. In this case, the sender can write two or more place names and addresses. The telegraph office first sends it to the first place name. If it is found that the recipient has left that place, it is then sent to the second place name. If the recipient has left, it is then sent to the third place name, and so on, until it is delivered. This is a very convenient method. As for the fee, the sender can pay the fee for the first leg in advance, and the remaining fees can be collected from the recipient. The sender can also pay all the fees if they wish. If the sender wants to know when this type of forwarding telegram has been delivered, they can use the "inform upon delivery" method. Add the words "inform upon delivery" to the beginning of the telegram (counted as one word for billing), and pay an additional fee equivalent to six words of an ordinary telegram. The telegraph office will then send a notification to the sender when the telegram has been delivered, informing the sender that the telegram was delivered on a certain day at a certain time. When the sender receives this telegram, they know that the telegram has been delivered and can rest assured! I'm afraid very few people understand this hurdle of sending telegrams. I hope readers will tell their relatives and friends, so that when they encounter this situation, they can calmly send a forwarding telegram, without having to send one telegram to place A first, and then send another telegram to place B after the telegraph office informs them that it could not be delivered. This not only avoids delaying a lot of time, but also saves a lot of trouble. It is indeed a very convenient way to send telegrams!</p>
<p>(5) Transferring Telegrams: If the recipient sometimes has to go elsewhere due to important matters, but anticipates that a telegram will be sent to a certain place, in order to avoid delaying the telegram, they can go in person or notify the telegraph office by letter that if a telegram addressed to them is received, it should be immediately transferred to the telegraph office at the place they are going to and delivered to the recipient. The fee can be paid in advance by the recipient, or paid upon receipt. Also, if the recipient did not contact the telegraph office before leaving, their family members or relatives can also request that the telegram be transferred to a certain place, but the fee must be paid by the requester. This method seems similar to sending another telegram, but if the recipient notifies the telegraph office in advance, the telegram does not need to be delivered by messenger, but can be directly transferred to a certain place, which is much faster! Furthermore, if you ask family members or relatives to resend a telegram from a certain place, then at least you must add words such as "telegram from a certain place" to the text, which will cost more!</p>
<p>(6) Self-Translation of Code: I have already mentioned self-translation of code when discussing ways to save money. However, there is another advantage to translating code yourself, which is that the telegraph office can send the telegram immediately upon receipt without delay. If the telegraph office is asked to translate it, because there are more than one or two telegrams to be translated, busy telegraph offices often have several or even dozens of telegrams to be translated at the same time. In that case, even if the telegraph office dispatches three or four people to translate them, there will inevitably be some delay, which will certainly be slower than self-translated telegrams. Therefore, self-translation of code is also a small hurdle to making telegrams fast!</p>
<p>The above mentioned six hurdles are all ways to make telegrams fast. Now let's talk about how to make telegrams accurate:</p>
<p>(1) Writing Clearly: People sending telegrams often write the telegram text sloppily because the matter is urgent. When telegraph office personnel receive it, they may misread it and send it incorrectly, causing the recipient to misunderstand the meaning of the telegram and think it is the telegraph office's negligence. In foreign language telegrams, A and O, E and L, B and F, Q and G, etc. are very similar. If the writing is blurry, it is easy to misread and send incorrectly. Also, in telegrams typed by a typewriter, sometimes the typist is lazy and does not erase the misspelled letters, but instead types another letter on top of the letter, so it will become a letter that looks like both A and O, making it impossible for telegraph office personnel to identify it. This is the fault of the sender themselves. If it is wrong, they have to bear the responsibility! Therefore, writing telegrams clearly is a small hurdle to making telegrams accurate. Furthermore, the sender's name and address must be clearly stated at the bottom of the telegram so that the telegraph office can inquire or notify the sender if there is an error in the telegram or if it cannot be delivered; otherwise, it will be impossible to notify them, delaying their telegram.</p>
<p>(2) Proofreading Telegrams: If there are numbers of silver or money, or important words and phrases in the telegram, which are of great importance and cannot be wrong, then the sender can request the telegraph office to proofread the telegram during transmission in order to ensure accuracy and reliability. This type of telegram is called a proofread telegram. Write the word "proofread" at the beginning of the telegram, and pay an additional proofreading fee, calculated at one-half of the ordinary telegram fee. The text can be guaranteed to be error-free. If, unfortunately, an error occurs again, the telegraph office can refund the entire fee, but this is very rare. Although senders have to pay an additional half fee for this method, the text can be absolutely guaranteed to be accurate, so that it does not delay important matters, which is also worthwhile!</p>
<p>(3) Write the Original Text When Self-Translating Code: As mentioned above, self-translating code can save money and speed things up. However, it is inevitable to mistranslate code in a hurry. Therefore, it is best to write the original text on the bottom of the telegram so that telegraph office personnel can check the code against the original text when receiving it, and correct any errors. This can also be considered a small hurdle to making telegrams accurate!</p>
<p>I have mentioned so many hurdles for sending telegrams above, but it is inevitable that some things are missing. It is best for readers to write to our newspaper for a copy of the "Abstract of New Regulations on Saving Telegraph Fees" and other telegraph regulations (see the advertisement in the upper right corner), and read them carefully. Then you will understand all kinds of hurdles without any omissions!</p>

<p>— A Contributor</p>
<p>Improved Method for Translating and Sending Chinese Telegrams: In the past, the Ministry of Communications established a method for free translation of incoming telegrams for the convenience of the public, which has been well received by the public since its implementation. However, the incoming telegrams mixed handwritten code with translated text, making it inconvenient and not very neat for recipients to read. Therefore, a few months ago, the Ministry of Communications specially purchased a Chinese typewriter and sent it to the Nanjing Telegraph Bureau for trial. All incoming Chinese code telegrams only type the text and do not copy the code. Each line can type more than ten characters, which is very convenient for recipients to read, and the typeface is clear and the image is excellent. In order to promote this, the Ministry of Communications has specially ordered all subordinate stations to translate and transcribe the text of all incoming Chinese code telegrams received by the Weston machine, and not to copy the code. The major bureaus and stations will also purchase Chinese typewriters for application according to the example of the Nanjing Bureau.</p>
<p>Method for Counting Words in English News Telegrams: English news telegrams often contain abbreviations and irregular compound words. Because telegraph offices are required to count them as two or three words according to regulations, this often causes misunderstandings for senders. The Ministry of Communications has now established a method for counting words: all non-commonly seen abbreviations and compound words not listed in English dictionaries should be charged according to the number of words that should be counted when writing them out in full. A small booklet has been printed with detailed examples for news reporters to request and avoid misunderstandings. (This booklet can also be requested from our newspaper by letter)</p>

<h3 id="e235">Child Welfare Issues <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>The conference of child welfare leaders, bringing together experts in child education, hygiene, psychology, and other fields, has already "jointly explored" the issues, successfully completed its work, and announced its closure. It is reported that the resolutions reached include the following: (1) Requesting the government to guarantee child welfare undertakings and support their development; (2) Requesting the government to issue arrest warrants for trafficking in women and children, and to reiterate the strict enforcement of the ban on keeping slaves and raising maids; (3) Requesting an order to prohibit underage children from pulling rickshaws; and (4) Requesting the government to formulate a child law as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Chinese children have already fallen into a pitiful state along with the decline of the entire nation. Many poor orphans who have lost their parents in childhood either become beggars, thieves, and die, or countless non-orphaned children also face the same fate due to poverty "since birth." They either become slaves and maids, doing arduous work to make a living, or the sins of selling sons and daughters occur by the thousands under this fundamental cause. Especially in recent years of disasters, poor farmers first kill their children and then commit suicide, exchange children for food, and lead young girls into cities to become "child prostitutes," all of which illustrate the crux of the Chinese child problem.</p>
<p>Now, so many child welfare leaders who hold infants in their arms have gathered at sea to try to save them. Their mentality of "loving my children and extending that love to the children of others" is truly admirable, and I hope that their efforts will "cultivate virtue in their children." However, the trafficking of children and making them do arduous work such as pulling rickshaws certainly makes people "fear and feel compassion," but when they have no way to make a living, they have no choice but to sell their bodies, working like animals to maintain their lives. To seek a paper ban to eliminate this is no different from ordering them to sit and wait for death? Establishing child laws, organizing nurseries, orphanages, baby care centers, child education societies, happiness societies, and health clubs, while compassionate, still, we especially hope to see efforts to eliminate the social roots that trap children in a miserable fate. Otherwise, without addressing the root cause, I have not seen any success.</p>
<p>As this "Children's Year" is about to arrive, we would like to offer this advice to child welfare leaders, and at the same time, we hope that people will be alerted to the fact that in this syphilitic society, the facts of the problem facing children are becoming even more exposed!</p>

<p>— Linlin</p>
<p>When we changed into flannel suits, we were invited by a friend to Jiaxing, the city of Misty Rain Tower. There were four of us going together, all living in the urban circle. We felt an unusual excitement for this short trip, preparing for several days as if attending a serious banquet, and also spending considerable time hesitating about the trip.</p>
<p>Under the high sky, the morning breeze fluttered our colored ties, and we arrived in Jiaxing after a two-hour journey. A friend was already waiting for us on the platform, along with his younger sister. On the way to his home, the six of us were filled with an unusual joy.</p>
<p>Changing the environment, in the eyes of strangers, every tree and blade of grass is a rare flower and plant. We did not stop walking all afternoon, really wanting to find unexpected satisfaction in this new environment. But we did not go to Misty Rain Tower, leaving this scenic spot to enjoy tomorrow. The sun had not yet set. After dinner, we sat by the river behind his house, arguing that we should not waste this lovely autumn night. My friend's younger sister suggested hiring a small boat to cruise the river. Just then, the clear sound of selling water chestnuts came from the river. We knew that Jiaxing's South Lake water chestnuts were so famous, and several of us rushed down the stone steps. The water chestnut seller was a girl, rowing the scull alone, which was very enticing. We bought a basin of water chestnuts and sat on the stone steps to peel them. Perhaps our foreign accents aroused the girl's interest, she forgot her profession. Although she kept shouting "selling water chestnuts," she did not row her scull. My friend's younger sister jokingly asked to rent her boat, which she unexpectedly agreed to. She even rented another small boat for us, and the six of us swarmed onto it like bees.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the joke. Me, my friend's younger sister, and Qi, who came with us, jumped onto the rented boat. Except for Qi, who could row a few strokes, the two of us could not be sailors, so our boat was always far behind theirs. The water chestnut seller scoffed at us, "If you want to eat water chestnuts, hurry up and catch up." Later, after a while, we caught up, but my friend pulled Qi over, and their boat flew like an arrow, sending waves of laughter from afar.</p>
<p>Helpless, I took up the scull and tried hard to row, but still spinning in circles. So the two of us worked together to row, sweating all over, but the boat did not move forward a few feet, and the boat in front had disappeared. At this time, a boat came towards us. They said that it was now low tide, and it was not easy to row upstream. The two of us had no choice but to drop the scull and let it slowly drift back. In the moonlight, we chatted idly. I don't remember what we talked about now. The boat drifted back to her home by the river, and we sat on the stone steps for a long time before their boat returned.</p>
<p>The next day, we took the night train back to Shanghai. The brother and sister sent us to the station with warm feelings, asking when we would come to Jiaxing again to play for a few more days. Qi replied, "Next year when the water chestnuts are on the market, that girl has made an appointment with me." We parted with laughter.</p>
<p>The following spring, a friend wrote a letter saying that his younger sister was coming to Shanghai to study. But in the autumn, I suddenly received a letter from her saying that her mother did not allow her to come to Shanghai to study, and asked if I could come to Jiaxing to eat South Lake water chestnuts?</p>
<p>It was time to change into flannel suits again. Counting the years, it had been three years. The letter I sent had also been returned by the post office. I really missed the girl's clear sound of selling water chestnuts!</p>
<h3 id="e237">Emotion Tax <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Reading the 50th issue of "Lun Yu", I found the following in "Bi-Weekly News":</p>
<p>Sichuan has recently added a surtax on grain taxes, called "Emotion Tax". It is said that adding this surtax is for the purpose of providing supplies for the stationed troops. In this way, the military and the people will have harmonious feelings, and there will be no drawbacks of extortion from the people.</p>
<p>After reading it, I couldn't help but laugh bitterly and loudly for half an hour, and repeatedly shouted "Oh! Grand!" more than ten times. Still not feeling completely relieved, my fingers started to itch, so I spread out the manuscript paper and tried to elaborate on the three words "Emotion Tax".</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is not only a brand new invention in Sichuan's tax policy, but also the ultimate in tax policy progress. I think this method must neither be "existing since ancient times" nor "imported from foreign countries", but a new initiative of the local authorities. We know very well that Sichuan is quite strange as Sichuan. Take the collection of grain taxes, for example. According to reports in newspapers many times, some have been collected for more than fifty years, some for more than sixty years, and even some for more than eighty years. Then, I think the general statistics are all pre-collected for more than forty years. There won't be a fool who only observes the progress of others and "sticks to the old ways" by only pre-collecting for a few or dozens of years.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have often seen reports in newspapers that Sichuan's politics have been relatively improved, but unexpectedly the sign of its improvement is the establishment of the clever name of "Emotion Tax".</p>
<p>This cannot but be regarded as the cleverness of the local authorities, or perhaps because the surtax on grain taxes is so numerous that it is impossible to add more, and all the names have been exhausted. I racked my brains and wondered whose divine spirit came up with such a method - an unprecedented, unparalleled method.</p>
<p>However, the three words "Emotion Tax" are still a bit harsh and heartbreaking! If it is really as stated in the "Lun Yu": "In this way, the military and the people will have harmonious feelings, and there will be no drawbacks of extortion from the people." Then I will also express my congratulations on behalf of the Sichuan people.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Lemon Milk and Women <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>A young couple walked leisurely and lightly. Occasionally passing by fruit stores, the woman would often say: Buy a lemon to take back! Or walking to the entrance of a department store, stopping and saying: Buy a can of milk! The man would always inadvertently chime in: Then buy two more. Do you like to eat this stuff? The woman would smile and not answer. In the end, she always only bought one and a small can. The man would get impatient and hurriedly add: Why buy such a small can? It won't last two days. Just buy two big cans! Milk and lemons are both good things, eating more is okay. But the woman always bought according to her own ideas, not listening to the man's good intentions. The man was really a bit puzzled, why always only buy a small can and a pair?</p>
<p>When getting up together in the morning, the man didn't really pay much attention to the woman's washing up. But the woman would look for a small knife to open the milk early in the morning. The man thought she was hungry, quickly opened it, ready to pour it out and brew, and also brew some coffee to add to it. But the woman snatched it away, took the milk, towel, toothbrush, and other items, and went into the bathroom. When cutting a lemon, the man wanted to help her brew it, but she also didn't need any help. This was strange! Women's temperaments are so strange! Hard to grasp. Taking it into the bathroom, to eat it all alone? That's probably not it. Always loving this set, so he had to see what the reason was. Women are so funny, sneaking into the bathroom to take a look.</p>
<p>Water and towel were all prepared, reaching out a slender and tender ginger shoot-like hand, pouring a little milk into her palm, mixing in some water drops, rubbing her hands together, and wiping it on her face, just like wiping snow cream. The man suddenly laughed: Why are you doing this? Turning her head, she shyly smiled back: Silly, you don't understand… don't mind, go away! The man still hadn't woken up: What does it mean exactly, tell me clearly! Hee hee hee, the woman laughed non-stop, lightly wiping her face: Clumsy, go away, I'll tell you later… The man was full of curiosity, waiting beside her, watching intently.</p>
<p>The woman finished washing up, tidying up for almost half an hour. The man kept teasing her, because his legs were getting sore. With a face full of smiles, she pulled the man into the bedroom, that face like a freshly picked apple, gently touching the man's cheek and face, lightly rubbing her skin against the man's skin: How is it? More delicate, right? More smooth? The man was like he had discovered a strange thing, and laughed in amazement: It is more delicate and smooth! It turned out that women often use milk and lemon juice to wipe their faces, treating it as one of the cosmetic decorations. Washing with this stuff, is indeed "more delicate and smooth!" Not bad at all, lemon milk and women, these days, there are so many interesting things!</p>

<h3 id="e240">Evening of a Memorial Day <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Two years ago in the autumn, Ade was still a young and strong youth. He and his comrades were transferred to this prosperous metropolis for the first time. At that time, he was so happy in his heart! He had been a soldier for several years, and every year he was only desperately fighting with his brothers. Finally, he got this opportunity to come to this peaceful, happy, and peaceful city to rest. For him, he had never dreamed of such a day for years. But in less than a few months, an unexpected event happened, breaking his dream. What was presented before his eyes was no longer that peaceful, happy, and peaceful city, but a battlefield with artillery fire everywhere. All day long, what flew over his head was only that terrible cannonball and airplane.</p>
<p>The red flag of the sun was planted all over Ade's previous position. After several months of desperate fighting, Ade was lucky enough not to be killed in battle, but he had already become a disabled person. From this time on, in this city, there were always the footprints of this wanderer.</p>
<p>Hunger and cold, day by day, increasingly pressed down on Ade. Even that bowl of coarse rice soldier's meal and that thin cotton coat could not be obtained. Therefore, whenever he suffered too much from the ravages of hunger and cold, he would go crazy and bark like a dog:</p>
<p>"Am I not human? Am I doomed to starve and freeze?"</p>
<p>One autumn passed and then another autumn. Ade wandered through the streets of this city all day long, and lay under the shop awnings on North Sichuan Road all night. When it rained, he couldn't even lie down and walked on the road all night.</p>
<p>Heaven finally showed great compassion to the poor, and stopped the rain a few days ago, and the sun shone brightly all day long. Of course, this was like finding a way out for Ade, but at night, he still cursed heaven.</p>
<p>Today, when the street cleaner was sweeping the road, Ade walked from that small alley onto the road, because today is a memorial day, and there will definitely be more pedestrians on the road. This means that Ade can beg for a little more money to eat a full meal. He knew that he was Chinese, and he should also be happy on this memorial day.</p>
<p>The sun seemed particularly hot today, and the crowded pedestrians on the road were all sweating. No one bothered to take out the coins from their pockets to give to these uninteresting beggars. From morning until afternoon, Ade did not beg for a single coin.</p>
<p>On this memorial day evening, Ade, this disabled man who had been wandering in this city for two years, entered prison for the twenty-third time.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Illness <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Illness, for me, is truly a great threat. In every aspect, it is enough to devastate me and shake my inherent beliefs. After suffering through illness once, my thoughts on life are painted with a deeper layer of grey doubt. If I were not so lacking in material resources, there would not be such a great change. But when I am in dire straits, so poor that I cannot even secure my daily three meals, and then I fall ill, it is not just my thoughts that are shaken, but my entire world that crumbles. At this moment, I will despairingly shout to myself: Let it end like this, let my sorrowful life end quickly. My life is like a ripple on the water's surface in the darkness, appearing and disappearing, without a moon, without stars, and without even a sliver of light to brighten my eyes and lift my spirits! Instead, it is filled with boundless dark clouds and a thick fog of boundless gloom. What hope can I hold onto? I truly no longer wish to live out my days bearing this heavy burden of suffering.</p>
<p>Every day, I wish I could stop breathing sooner rather than later, quietly return to the earthen mound covered with weeds, and sleep forever. That would be my greatest satisfaction. But what method can I use to achieve this goal! Severing my own neck with my own hands would be the most decisive thing to do. But alas, I cannot muster that kind of courage. So, I can only hope that illness will fulfill my wish for me. Therefore, whenever an illness descends upon me, not only do I not feel the slightest terror or fear, but I even feel a sense of joy, as if my hope has been revealed. I secretly rejoice: My long-cherished wish is about to be fulfilled. I fervently pray that my condition will worsen day by day, until it can no longer worsen.</p>
<p>Each time I am bedridden, I hope that the illness will destroy my life. But no, the ending only brings me more and greater suffering. When I am ill, even if I do not take medicine, the illness does not intensify! After a few days, I recover, much to my dismay. It does not get rid of me cleanly and quickly, but it becomes an overly familiar companion, visiting me from time to time. And with each bout of illness, my body naturally becomes weaker and thinner day by day after recovery, and at the same time, my thoughts become increasingly dark and gloomy. In the end, not only do I completely lose hope in everything, but I also become a mere shell, a soulless ghost. Therefore, not only do I curse everything and hate everything, but I especially hate the illness. I originally had a strong affection for it, but now it is using this cruel method to slowly manipulate me and fool me. How can I endure this dry and tasteless life, devoid of all hope?</p>
<h3 id="e242">Insomnia <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Shan</p>
<p>It's been ten days since I started counting my insomnia.</p>
<p>My eyes gaze at the clock on the desk; the long hand is on six again, and the short hand is pointing exactly at two o'clock after midnight.</p>
<p>I recite numbers, from one to ten, my eyelids closing and opening, opening and closing. Lying on her side, my companion sleeps soundly, her face pale with melancholy and suffering, breathing outside the covers, that breath resembling the sighs of a dying person.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a threat of death dominates her entire life. And in that moment of thinking about death, all luck and happiness are destroyed under the threat of death. Tilting her head back, she scrutinizes her bluish-grey face once more.</p>
<p>"Two miserable people together..." she murmurs.</p>
<p>"Why can't I sleep?"</p>
<p>She asks herself again, her heart ringing inside like an ancient bell.</p>
<p>Is it almost a nervous breakdown? She worries, and then visions of passing by the gate of the mental hospital during the day appear before her eyes.</p>
<p>How much she detests this death-like life! No sound, moans, medicine bottles, sorrowful faces, her own neurasthenia, insomnia, no appetite... Detestable! A lonely person with a lonely heart, living in this lonely place.</p>
<p>(The day of the end of life is not far away, alas!)</p>
<p>She looks at the short hand again and sighs.</p>
<p>The reason for not being able to sleep is simple: the busy routine during the day, the instability, of course, makes it impossible to sleep soundly at night, unless one is a soulless husk. She feels sad!</p>
<p>A sorrowful heart, a person with a sorrow that no one understands, she can't get a bit of comfort for herself, and she still has to deal with adults and children, forcing herself to smile, spreading the layer of silent air to the most lively atmosphere. She hides her true self, concealing her heartfelt sorrow, daring not to shed a tear or vent her frustration, every day putting on the old routine of a clown on stage, laughing, telling stories, singing lively jazz, everyone enduring the gloomy rainy days of autumn in happiness, but what does she get? She is so uneasy.</p>
<p>(I am in great pain, but I must take care of these things, alas!)</p>
<p>Softly, as if in a dream, dragging her slippers, she extinguishes the lamp, her eyes still shining brightly in the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>The north wind is blowing, cold and desolate. A red stove in the painted building. The beauty wakes up in the morning with a sigh. Hateful husband traveling far away. Frequent thoughts, tears flowing. Long nights add to the sorrow. The birds do not know the sound of the water. Only the lonely wild goose is difficult to come out. A pair of good boats without oars. A three-legged bed like a seagull on the water. The wind blows the iron horse, clanging. The ignorant rats come to bite the pillow. It's halfway through the third watch. Dreaming of the husband as a couple. Hands hugging the waist, feet hooked. Just as the muscles and bones are softening, the rat comes to join my head. Is it upstairs? Is it hooked? Waking up, it turns out to be a dream.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Some Adorable Tidbits About Shirley Temple <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yang</p>
<p>This adorable "little baby," Shirley Temple, is currently filming "Now and Forever" at the Paramount studio. One day, just after Shirley finished filming a scene, the director, Mr. Henry Hathaway, suddenly rushed off. People were puzzled, thinking he had gone mad. Little did they know, he had gone to buy ice cream for Shirley, because her crying scene was so genuine that Hathaway couldn't help but be moved. There was also a star, Gary Cooper, who worked with her on the same set. He was originally an artist who had worked as an illustrator for a newspaper. He used all sorts of methods to get Shirley to sit still for a portrait. After it was finished, he gave her a velvet teddy bear named Grong Bay.</p>
<p>Many people think that Shirley Temple's rise to stardom (she is indeed a star, earning $1,250 per week) was a matter of luck and chance. Of course, whether it's Shirley Temple or Katharine Hepburn, without the help of luck, they wouldn't be able to reach stardom. But to say that Shirley Temple, a five-year-old child, became a star entirely by luck is an injustice to her. She has been guided by her mother since she was a child, practicing various dance arts, to get to where she is now. And once someone reaches stardom, they must have the talent to maintain their position, and Shirley Temple's position is something that no other child can snatch away. Therefore, we can't help but admire the Fox Corporation's foresight in signing her to a long-term contract of seven years. During these seven years, she works six hours a day, filming every day. So, we can look forward to seeing more of this adorable little baby in the future.</p>
<p>She herself is a star, but she doesn't understand what a star is. Her parents also try their best to keep her from knowing, so she has no sense of self-importance. At this moment, she is playing with a girl companion on the set. Her mother calls out to her, "Shirley, come here." Shirley is playing too enthusiastically, she hears her mother calling her, and only replies, "Hello," and continues playing. Her mother then calls out again, "Shirley, come here." Shirley immediately puts down her toys and runs over. Regardless of whether she is a star, her mother is still her "Mommy." Her Mommy calls her to come, and she doesn't dare not come quickly. She comes, and she calls out, "Mommy, what is it?" She does whatever her mother tells her to do, and never disobeys her mother's wishes.</p>
<p>Every night, Shirley also has to memorize the lines for the next day's filming. She starts at eight o'clock, and goes to bed after she has memorized them. She gets up at seven o'clock every morning. She arrives at the studio before nine o'clock. Her face is so rosy and beautiful that it is even better than a vase. She also doesn't need makeup to go on camera, so the makeup time is very short. After working for six hours, she is exhausted when she gets home. She likes to rest her head on the pillow and meditate for a while. The people she thinks about are the head lighting technician Jilai, the star James Dunn, the third-class carpenter Tommy, the star Gary Cooper and the actress Carole Lombard, the assistant cameraman, the director Hathaway, Jenny Gaynor, and the children Marilyn, etc. In Shirley's little mind, there is absolutely no distinction of class. In her eyes, stars, lighting technicians, carpenters, directors, etc., are all equal friends, and they all love her with the same undivided attention.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's temperament is naturally sunny. She doesn't know that there are things like disillusionment, tragedy, disappointment, and melancholy in the world. But she did have a big cry once. That day was the day after the actress Dorothy Dell died tragically in a car accident. Shirley was filming, and the camera was already ready. She suddenly heard the director Hathaway talking to someone about Miss Dell's tragic death. Shirley and Dell had co-starred in "Kidnapped Child Star," so when she heard this, she couldn't help but feel grief and burst into tears. No matter how others tried to comfort her, they couldn't persuade her. So the director simply let her cry, and ordered the camera to be turned on, and filmed segments of the scene while she was crying in Carole Lombard's arms. But her nature is closer to the side of happiness, so after she finished crying, she happily forgot the clouds of the day again.</p>

<h3 id="e247">Review of "The Lady Is Willing" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Lady is Willing</p>
<p>丨Cathay丨</p>
<p>American films fully pay attention to the development of humor and wit, and now it has almost become a so-called "trend." I see this development in almost every film, regardless of the content of the work, which is determined to require serious and profound treatment, and the result is often that a large amount of slapstick destroys the heavy tone. Not long ago, "Whom the Gods Destroy" opened at the Great Light. In the latter part, it is undoubtedly a very profound tragedy, but in the first half, the playwright wanted to make it "funny" and "slapstick", and as a result, it became two separate existences before and after, with things that could not be unified in tone. Of course, the humorization of the first part made the profundity of the second part lose a lot. Similarly, we have seen many detective films that have also been relaxed and humorous, and besides "Mist Night", we can also cite many. If we classify "The Lady is Willing" as a detective film, then it is another comedic detective film.</p>
<p>In this film, the greatest achievement is undoubtedly the wit of the dialogue and the light and elegant rhythm. For the sake of humor, many funny characters have been added, and for the sake of lightness of tone, many interesting episodes that are not related to the content have been inserted.</p>
<p>In addition to some satire on ladies and entrepreneurs, the mockery of the three fools, describing them as very vulgar and funny characters, is an unconditional joke on the poor. Even Lee Bowman, who has always played sad tragedies, has become a humorous helper.</p>
<p>Yes, in terms of content, the humor here did not excessively lose the consistency of content and form. In other words, the characters contained in the story, except for the three fools, are all worth satirizing. However, strictly speaking, due to the random grabbing of chance materials, there is not much substantial content. But the playwright exaggerated this kind of material to the fullest extent, without weakening the characteristics of capitalist works at all, and became a work where form transcends content.</p>
<p>After the opening of "Puppet", someone actually said that "the form is not enough to express the content". In addition to illustrating that the film critics of the semi-colonial China are obsessed with the established form of American films, it is not enough to disprove the unity of content and form of "Puppet". Otherwise, they just don't understand enough. But on the other hand, we should strictly condemn American comedies that only exaggerate form without seeking content to be substantial and complete. Therefore, we have no way to give "The Lady is Willing" a higher evaluation, it is just a vulgar comedy.</p>

<h3 id="e248">My Review of "Red Chamber Spring Depths" <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zigui</p>
<p>"Red Chamber Spring Depths" is a soft film worth watching, but it is a pity that it only caters to the psychology of a few people, and it is only used by the noble people of the leisure class as a tool for recreation.</p>
<p>However, "Red Chamber Spring Depths" also has its merits. The director is indeed a bit clever. For example, several inverted shots are very commendable, especially the large characters of "Wash Away National Humiliation" made of torches, which did add a lot of color. However, there are also a few places that should be brought up and discussed with the playwright. (1) Since Yu Qingfeng is a rational young artist and he already has an ideal lover Zhou Bilian, how can he not get rid of a romantic woman Luo Lan? At the same time, he was forced into adultery and marriage. (2) There are many gimmicks, and it is dragged into the formalized low-level taste. (3) After the wedding ceremony, he immediately went on a honeymoon trip "the night of the wedding". Maybe this is the playwright's new creation? Because I have never heard of it in custom.</p>
<p>As for the actors, they are working hard.</p>

<p>After the movie star Betty Compson came to Shanghai, Mei Jiaoli and Huai De, the comedic dance stars of Fox Company, also arrived in Shanghai. In these years, the attraction of the oriental little Paris to Hollywood is more than once. The production of "The Good Earth" and the filming of "Oil Lamp" undoubtedly prove how the Westerners are paying attention to this Eastern nation! This time, Huai De came to Shanghai with her husband Eddie Tanant. The purpose is to investigate the East, and leave it for her new film to experience and contribute. At the same time, she was hired by the Paramount Ballroom to start performing tonight, performing her actions on the silver screen in a physical way for the entire Shanghai movie fans. Her husband is the dance director of Fox Company, and this time he also took the stage to perform, as a capable supporting role. With Compson in front and Huai De in the back, the people of Shanghai are really lucky!</p>
<h3 id="e250">About Fairy of the World <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Willow Catkin</p>
<p>After months of day and night efforts, and consuming the hard work of many people, the first Chinese sound and dance film "Fairy of the World" has finally been completed. It has been meeting with movie fans in Shanghai on the screen of Jincheng since last Saturday.</p>
<p>This is the first work of Mr. Du Danyue, who advocates fitness and beauty. The protagonist is Yuan Meiyun, and Ma Loufen, Bai Hong, Li Mingjian, Cang Yinqiu and many singers cooperated. Yuan Meiyun, who is gradually stepping into youth, since working hard on "The Roar of the Chinese Sea", due to the art of Meng Jin, has already brought her name to the peak of art. The general movie fans' expectations for this little girl's future are just like looking forward to the clouds in a severe drought. Now she has been pulled by Du Danyue to play the heroine of this dialogue sound film "Fairy of the World". With her innate acting talent and fluent Mandarin, she is of course able to do it happily.</p>
<p>There are also a few things that are worth special mention, that is, the clarity of the film's pronunciation is comparable to that of foreign films; and the beauty and magnificence of the picture are even more rare. At a time when foreign song and dance films are prevalent in the Chinese film market, it is not necessarily a blessing to have such a Chinese song and dance film for us to appreciate!</p>

<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>This is a tragic scene from the final days of the second Mexican Revolution. General Pasquel, the leader of the reactionaries, was besieged in the mountains of Chihuahua. Pancho Villa's army had suffered a setback, but Pasquel refused to press the attack, believing that his machine gun squads would ensure his ultimate victory. Thus, he miscalculated and was captured alive by Pancho. Pancho, sucking on an orange, walked up to the bound Pasquel. He said to Thomas, "Thomas, quickly untie him! A general is a general after all. This is truly absurd!" Thomas immediately untied Pasquel. Pasquel coldly thanked him with a snort. Pancho said, "It's nothing. Don't mention it. You think you're very brave, eh?" Pasquel said, "No need to be verbose. Just shoot me." Pancho laughed, "You speak well, much better than me. You know, I often think of you. Everyone in the world says Pancho Villa is a hero, a brave man. But in front of General Pasquel, I am just a man kneeling on the ground, crawling forward. I even begged, shouted, and cried, which was quite unsightly. Do you remember?" He threw the remains of the orange on the ground. Pasquel smiled slightly and said, "I remember very clearly." Pancho said, "I beg you to forgive me for everything I've done." Pasquel said, "If a person is afraid of death, he will do many strange things." Pancho said, "You're right. Afterwards, I asked myself many times: Pancho, are you really afraid of death? I said to myself: No! I tell you, maybe it's because of this. That little husband with the mustache. Love often makes a person afraid of death. That's philosophy, isn't it? Or you love someone, you also have a wife, children. Don't you want to see them again?" Pasquel sneered, "Do you want to hear me cry and shout? No, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I won't beg you. I won't cry either. I'm ready to be shot." Pancho laughed loudly, "Shoot? Who told you about shooting? Did you all talk about shooting?" As he spoke, he picked up a jar of honey from a long table and said to Pasquel, "General, this painting is not bad. From the same place as me. Would you like some?" Pasquel was looking down, and saw the orange remains that Pancho had just eaten and thrown on the ground, already swarming with white ants. When he saw the ants, he was as frightened as if he had seen a ghost. Beads of sweat as big as soybeans burst out from his forehead one by one and flowed down his face. Pancho slowly said, "They like honey, even more than oranges." As he spoke, he stuck two thick fingers into the honey jar, scooped up a large handful of honey, and dripping, walked up to Pasquel. Pasquel took a step back, his face turning green. Pancho reached out and shoved the honey-soaked fingers into his ears, smearing them all over Pasquel's face. Pasquel screamed wildly, "No! No! Not this way! You can't! Pancho! Don't do that! Let me say something! Pancho!" But Pancho nodded to his subordinates in Pasquel's direction, and several soldiers immediately dragged the pig-like general away. Pancho handed the jar of honey to Thomas and said, "Take this. Give him more. In his nose. In his ears. Anywhere. You know what to do." Thomas took the jar and retreated. Pasquel's miserable screams continued for half a day, slowly fading until they could no longer be heard. This is one example of Pancho Villa's inhumanity. Afterwards, he also ordered that all people of Spanish descent, regardless of age or gender, must leave Chihuahua within twenty-four hours, or they would all be shot. At this time, there was chaos, traffic was cut off, and there were no trains. The young and strong could still escape on foot. The old, young, weak, and disabled who were left behind would inevitably suffer a massacre. This was the result of the hatred accumulated from the various acts of tyranny during the Spanish rule of the Mexican natives, and Pancho's use of violence to replace violence only planted a bad seed for himself.
