<p>時評</p>
<h3>内蒙之危機　愼</h3>
<p>溥儀被人嗾使由傀儡之執政。進而僭稱皇帝。其用意所在。無非爲日閥便於侵呑東北而已。而禍變之來。恐尙有甚於此者。日蘇兩國武力鬭爭之形勢。已漸明瞭。時間雖未可預料。而終必出於一戰。則已無可否定。一旦爆發其戰爭塲所。正面衝突之焦點。必在北滿原野。因日本對俄凖備已久。十萬以上之大兵移動。不能遮盡世人耳目。蘇聯自蘇僞間發生中東路糾紛後。亦已次第向遠東增兵。鞏固其防禦工事。赤塔以東沿阿木耳及烏蘇里鐡道一帶。駐兵將近十五萬。此類行動。日蘇雙方當局。亦已公然自認。故可决其戰爭之點。必在北滿原野。然勝負之分。則不在北滿。而在資源之爭奪與側面之襲擊也。</p>
<p>日本資源缺乏。無論爲鐡爲煤爲石油。皆無巨量之藏貯。必求所以吸取之地。雖有東北四省可爲其寳庫。但一旦開戰。勢不能取携自如。而必另爲之謀。且戰事一發。除正面衝突外。其側面的鬭爭。必將牽聯於我國。緣今後之戰爭。非同過去僅恃平面之搏擊。而恃飛機發達之立體戰。立體戰之襲擊。側面尤較正面爲嚴重。於是我内蒙不能不受其影響。而其他部分亦恐不免殃及矣。　　夫内蒙六盟。今去其三。哲里木·卓索圖·昭烏達·已淪異域。我國倘不嚴密防範。則今後禍患之來。仍不可止。蓋日本揷足𤍠河而後。行動甚爲便利。在前不過閒關偷渡。爲間牒式之聯絡。今則有日軍爲之助。有僞政權爲之倀。林西之無綫電臺。已由秘密安設而公開發電。貝子廟一帶。到處有軍事偵探之足迹。且日軍閥動輒「滿蒙」連稱。在大連。在奉天。在日本國内。研究「滿蒙」之機關林立。是可知侵略滿洲。固爲其旣定政策。而侵略蒙古。亦係其預定之計劃。矧其所謂大陸政策。蒙古與滿洲。早已同一重視。因其地在軍略上。北旣可以防俄。南又可以侵華也。</p>
<p>其侵略内蒙之計劃。因溥儀之僭號而愈見暴露。日本之欲擾亂華北。自𤍠河被侵以還。更爲明顯。其所顧忌者。一懼我國人民作困獸之鬭。再慮國際糾紛之不易解决。三則日本自身之財政問題。尙多難關。是以不能不捨難就易。變更方向。以圖我人口稀薄經濟力低微抵抗力最小之蒙古。且蒙古之襲取。不必用重兵。祇須收買轉變蛻化中之蒙人。卽足擾亂蒙疆矣。</p>
<p>吾人所最憂慮者。卽因内蒙地方廣漠。人口稀少。雖敵人侵占非易。然蒙古本身。旣無近代軍事組織。足以制禦强隣。我又限於地域。不能發動大兵以衛蒙疆。當此多事之秋。日蘇衝突急劇之際。内蒙在航空關係之價値。頗爲重要。且今日之内蒙古。不同於以往之新疆。蒙古自治雖已成立。但無宗敎上之爭端。又無漢蒙民族之對立。更無歷史上之仇𨻶。其恊同禦侮。互相扶助。勢似甚易。所可慮者。經濟實力薄弱。一切敎養建設。初未着手。恢復整理。動需時日。今卽因環境之危迫。而欲急謀防衛。竊恐凖備未週。而强敵又出現於境上耳。然而吾人不能不爲未雨之綢繆。亡羊補牢。猶未爲晚。卽此意也。</p>

<h3>日俄關係惡化意大利深切注視日人好戰狂與西方以威脅力主全世界對日經濟抵制</h3>
<p>●羅馬　意大利報界對於日俄關係之緊張、極爲注意、各報已發表無數文字、論日本帝國主義之危險、最近衆議院對海軍預算案所提之報吿書、已言及此事、其扼要之言曰、「日本人對戰爭之看法、與白人不同、白人欲避免戰爭、而日人則以暴骨沙塲爲無上光榮、日人以爲西方人惟世俗之樂是務、其文明偏於物質、無高尙之理想、卑下而不足道、日人之心理以爲日本民族、負有歷史上之任務、卽「大和人種之勝利」、是也、此爲世界未來慘劇之基礎、日本民族之前進、不僅以軍力爲後盾、且以爲負有任務而有自信之力、日本現已進據中國之領土、行將加以組織、日後更將鼓吹人種之仇視心理、進而攻擊白人、未來之危險已露端倪、吾人不可僅視爲𣏌人之憂而漠然置之也」、人民日報亦發表文字評論此事、其主旨在考慮歐洲各民族對此公同危險、究應何所作爲以防禦之、其言曰、「自有世界以來、人類遇有死亡之危險、其抵抗之法不外兩端、卽自衛或攻擊是也、對於日本之威脅、若欲自衛、一方宜提高一切關稅壁壘、以抵制日本貨物、一方宜低减西方各國之工資、以减輕貨物之成本、並减輕社會保險之負擔、至於攻擊、則近年曾有適宜之機會、陳於吾人之前、不幸業已失之、所謂機會卽國聯處理中日爭端之時、日本不服從該會之决定、拂袖而去、繼續從事戰事、當是時也、吾人若宣布由全世界排斥日貨、豈不甚善、惜乎毫無行動、致此良機、交臂失之、目下所希望者、惟日本或發生社會革命、以提高工資、使其貨物不能再以廉價傾銷耳、舍此以外、尙有戰爭之一途、此事自若干時以來日本國民中、已有醖釀者、其情形或爲吾人所不及料至於蘇俄或爲形勢所鼓勵、而凖備此種社會革命或戰爭、甚或促其從速實現、而不致使歐洲牽涉在内、蘇俄以外大約尙有美國、日本若與蘇俄及美國發生戰事、則被威脅之歐洲、將由此獲救矣、」人民報又謂、歐洲各國當停止内閧、不當以其視線專注於法德兩國永世不解之衝突、歐洲如不欲沉淪、則宜互相團結、以共禦外來之危險云（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>東歐一帶日軍官之活動</h3>

<p>（一）若欲達到軍縮之目的、各國應於政策問題謀妥恊、維持世界之和平、（一）攻擊軍器不能不限制、日本第二次海軍補充計劃、係自衛所必需、而不可目爲威脅香港或斐列賓、若說英美有被威脅、此乃手足一部分而已、反之、日本若受英美之威脅則將及於國家之核心、故歐美列强若妥恊、應容認日本之主張、（一）帝國六十餘年來、從未閉鎖門户、惟歐美諸國則對於亞洲民族閉鎖門户、而反要求東洋之開放、若欲貫澈此主張而圖充實軍備、實言語道斷云、（十四日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）貴族院公正會於此次議會、將嚴重檢討軍事費、且將論及軍紀問題、但未必與貴院各派一致主張强硬論、惟鑑於衆院政黨之萎頓、故貴院此際嚴正議事之空氣、各派均有、若檢討各派之主張、計有如下之三潮流、（一）一九三五年國防之重大、固不待言、惟預算案之輕易通過則不可、應嚴正檢討、且於軍紀問題亦應議論、（二）國際情形現正危險、故不論難軍事預算、及不刺戟軍部感情、（三）不深究軍事預算、向舉國一致打開時間邁進、又其間研究會保守沉默、故貴族院亦意外無風浪云、（十四日電通電）</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>自然科學與社會</h3>
<p>科學孰爲重要與急需？</p>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>靑年的感覺，本來是極銳敏的、靑年的情感是極𤍠烈的；可是現實的一切、實在太糟了，太不合理了。由於客觀的不合理，和自己缺乏人生的經騐，因此引起一般靑年的消極和煩悶。</p>
<p>靑年是時代的驕兒，未來的國家建設和社會改進。大都須靠着他們的努力而後方能成功，現在就讓他們這樣的消極過去嗎？自然，不應如此。貴報的「讀書問答」，替靑年開一智識探討的方便，不單直接的爲靑年前途的明燈、且間接的亦替社會國家謀了不少的福利，這是件極値得贊頌的盛舉！</p>
<p>同哲學陣營裏的唯物和唯心的爭辯一樣，現在浮在我的腦内且急迫須求解答的還有：科學二大類中社會科學和自然科學，究竟那一個在中國的需要，社會的急需，個人的出路上，來得比較需要些，而我去研究二者中那一個？</p>
<p>有的說：「研究自然科學罷，因爲從空間着想，在現在的中國，非它不足以反抗帝國主義的經濟侵略以至政治侵略；不足以消災救荒；不足以富國强民。從時間上着想，非它不能應付工業落後的危機；不能完成憲政時期的物質需要；不能安定現代農村經濟恐慌，羣衆失業而使時局安定。」</p>
<p>有的說：「有人以爲中國的病症在經濟貧困，對症發藥的方法，一方面是改良農村的農業生產方式，一主面是振興都市的工商業。我們試問這偌大的資本從何處來，旣須煞費躊躇，卽有之：在同時把持了中國的海關，運輸，開採，銀行等經濟特權的資本過剩，生產過剩的帝國主義，高度的壓迫下，能不能發展，能不能與之爭一日之短長呢？又是個問題了。更加上商戰頻仍，兵匪遍地的紛擾局面，有沒有發展的可能，又是個問題。更退一步說，假使帝國主義，封建殘餘都打倒了，難道農工商業就可以抵賴新式機器而振興嗎？不明白農村經濟的組織，國際政治經濟的組織，就可以隨隨便便談振興談改良嗎？那便非社會科學不可了！」</p>
<p>以上是說它倆的優點，至於缺點方面社會科學有：「中國是個產業落後的國家，無論社會科學怎樣的研究改良政治，但因了中國是個大貧小貧的國家，所以不能富强起來，再者中國現在已經有了三民主義，所以不再需要社會科學所研究出來不適中國國情的舶來主義；並且變更一種制度不是件容易的事，對於國民經濟又不合，非但不能够爲民衆謀幸福，反足以火上加油，益加痛苦。」自然科學方面有「科學家（指自然科學家）發明機器，汽車，……一切，祗供他們更加深的壓迫勞苦大衆，或享福，科學愈發達，而大多數的人民更受其蹂躪壓迫；或許卽使科學洗禮給你，或大多數人民以福利，可是當社會的基層一更動之後，卽全盤倒下。」</p>
<p>雙方瑕瑜互見，不過一般的說起二者在我們中國是同樣的需要着，但「人生有涯」，一個人的精力有限，决不能二者兼顧，「一時欲爲多事者，反至一事無成，」「十事之　通，不如一事之精通。」爲着時間計，爲着精神計，我更有一種不合邏輯的要求，到底那樣比較需要？</p>
<p>我想这恐怕不是我個人的要求，大多數的靑年類都有這種要求，這要求而能解决，或許可以稍解靑年的煩悶，所以很急的很潦草的冩來這封信希望先生參酌時代的環境，權其輕重，明其緩急，給以一個明晰的解答（千祈勿模稜兩可）。則不單是我的幸福，就是大多數的靑年亦可因此而蒙利。囉囉唣唣的冩了不少，就此結束。（余萬望來信）</p>

<h3>工學台</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>從前楊杏佛先生曾說過，中國有這樣三種人：第一種是大頭</p>
<p>腦的；第二種是大手脚的；第三種是大肚皮的，明白地說來：第一種人是學而不工；第二種人是工而不學；第三種人是不學不工，學而不工的，卽知識階級，只知用腦，不用手脚，所以稱做大頭腦的；工而不學的，指勞動階級，只用手脚，不用思想，所以稱做大手脚的；不學不工的，卽指有閑階級，頭腦旣不用，手脚又不動。</p>
<p>實際上，不但中國人如此，卽今日人類一般的生活，也都只是這麽三種，不學不工的，這裏不必說，其學而不工的，旣然學離開了工，那末無異是一具兩脚櫉，卽使你的學問再好些，也沒有用處，要是給漫畫家描摹起來，變成一個小手小脚載上一個大頭腦的怪物，其工而不學的，旣然工離開了學，便一架任人利用，終歲盲動的機器，無讑你做的如何勤懇，終無進步的希望，要是給漫畫家描摹起來，與前者恰恰相反，也是很够玩味的。</p>
<p>顯然的，工與學分家以後，工者只管關起腦門來作工，用手不用腦，勞力不勞心；學者只管閉起眼睛來空想，用腦不用手，勞心不勞力，這樣各行其道，各異其趨，一切的一切，便永無進化了，所以工學分家的病象是不該有了；那末，工學合一是必然的了，所謂工學合一，就是從學上頭去做，在做裏面去學，換句話說，就是從工作裏面去找活知識；同時又把書本上面的死知識，一一活用到工作上面去，這樣，所得的知識，才是思想與行爲結合而產生的死知識；所做的工作，也是思想與行爲結合而產生的眞工作，所以「工學合一」，實爲現代敎育上唯一的出路。</p>
<h3>戴眼鏡的哲學</h3>
<p>— 醉竹</p>
<p>眼鏡能給予人們不少的帮助。在這奇形怪狀的社會裏，使你認淸道路，明瞭世態，確乎是少不得的東西。但你在選用之初，必須揀你所需要的：否則反而有害。</p>
<p>你的眼力，若是見近不見遠，只能認識眼前事物的話，那麽你需要一付「近視」。「近視」這個名詞，反面文章。含有充分的幽默意味。它是名「近視」而實不「近視」的。它能把很遠的事態，使你淸淸楚楚見識到而一些不錯誤。但你要適可而止，不可過分求遠。看得太遠了，也許會把人看得很「小」的。</p>
<p>或者你並不求遠大的眼光，僅僅需要明瞭左近的事物而深切的認識它；那麽「老光」便能滿足你的慾望。它是把物體顯大顯明，任憑是極細微曲折的地方，它也能顯豁呈露地剖解給你看。使你觀察到事態的夾縫裏。但也不可過大，過大便把人（或物）看扁了。這是失了眞形，無益而有害的。</p>
<p>眼鏡裏頭，最好的是平光。精瑩朗澈，一點也不變更事態的眞相。所以有眞眼光的人，他是喜歡這公平的「平光」的</p>
<p>最不好是顏色眼鏡，看朱成碧，顚倒黑白，把好眼光也眩惑得閃爍不定起來。分明「朗朗乾坤」它會弄成「黑暗世界」。分明「光明前途」，它會使你「暗中摸索」。你越自命「日光如炬」，越會受它播弄。但也有幾樣好處；它能阻止利慾薰心的人，望前瞎闖。它能逃避别人的銳眼，隠藏自己的眞面。它能使賊人心虛的膽子，加大起來，以爲無人能窺察我的眼色。所以要人是歡迎它的。</p>
<p>現在戴眼鏡的人很多很多。照理應當有許多「眞眼光，好眼光，遠大的眼光，細密的眼光，」把各方面的眞形，赤條條地表現出我們眼前；但爲什麽事實幷不如此呢？爲什麽我們的目光，反不能一致呢，爲什麽各人見到的，都不同呢？大槪他們都戴錯了眼鏡了吧？還是戴了顏色眼鏡呢？怪！</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 徐豪君</p>
<p>走出醫院的門口，天空裏，疏疏落落，盤旋着幾隻「無枝可依」的鴉；馬路上面，打情調笑的儇薄少年，緊隨有一簇簇紗廠裏吐出來的女工後面。在那暮色蒼茫中，這些女工們，好像　掙脫了牢寵似的，歡笑自若，且躍且走地，趕回了伊們的家。</p>
<p>誰説我沒有家呢？我早就有家，我並且亦曾咒詛過家。但是每天，每天，當我拖了那雙沉重的腿，走上那破陋的扶梯，踏進那湫溢的屋子的時候，桌上陳列好了𤍠騰騰的晚餐，牀上鋪疊好了軟綿綿的被褥，家總是這樣預備著，期待著它主人的來臨。</p>
<p>物換星移，現在許久沒有到家了！「重門深鎖」，「鴛帳雙垂；」室内空氣，因爲沒有開窗，非常混濁；就是那幾册書，躱在罩了一層灰膜的玻璃櫉裏，久不受人翻弄，也好象失了戀的愛人似的，終日悉眉苦臉，暗地裏埋怨我「始亂終棄！」</p>
<p>這樣「鳳去樓空」的家，那裏是我棲身之所呢？無疑地，我得離家。</p>
<p>然而，「家，甜蜜的家」啊！宇宙是那樣昏暗，社會是那樣冷酷；到處碰壁的靑年們，誰也在𤍠戀你，誰也說要你；因爲祇有你，纔是他們的同情者；祇有你，展開你那仁慈的懐抱，撫摩他們創痛的心，給他們慰藉，舒適，和内心的愉快！</p>
<p>離開了你家吧？燈紅酒綠，紙醉金迷，那裏面充滿着虛僞，墮落，迷人的笑，金錢的誘惑；那雖然是公子哥兒，達官顯宦陶情沉醉的所在，但那，我敢說，决不是純潔靑年，有爲靑年所該要的家。</p>
<h3>介紹兩首民歌</h3>
<p>— 同初</p>
<p>宗法社會遺下的大家庭制，儘量有人仍在那裏歌頌它，但其一部分，至少已受到一般人心的詛咒了。</p>
<p>大家庭中，不是有所謂操大權的「家長」長嗎，那一家的人，物，似乎都是他的，他坐在高椅上，指揮着：怎樣怎樣，他人便依着去做，這是大家庭縱的方面之情形；至於橫的方面呢，互相傾軋，嫉忌，倚賴，推諉，爭鬧，「家長」知道後，自然要盡他職務的，於是一邊抽着潮烟，一邊轉着念頭：「各方都有相當理由，怎麽辦呢？還是拿軟的　　就算吧！」軟的是誰呢，自然是女子了。所以女子在這大家庭下，無緣的苦，更要多吃些。現在我要介紹我故鄕很流行的兩首民歌，你們看：她們何等在那裏歌頌理想的光臨，同時隠隠然見伊們在那裏咒詛。</p>
<p>莫道女子無行業，天天出門揀茶葉揀粗揀細任人嘲，臉泛紅霞笑生　，茶葉如何可定親，祇緣茶樹忌移根，阿奴尙未將茶受，可有郎來議　结親。</p>
<p>單住家，獨燒鍋，夫妻兩人快活多，沒有妯娌來爭吵，沒有公婆壓制我，别人羡我無雙福，我說婦女之福靠丈夫，但願丈夫不吸烟，不習賭，尋的銅錢放到家裏多。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十二回　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息　杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>他抬頭看時，這天橋旁邊，正有一座平臺，外面護有短欄干，有一個作護兵模樣的人，站在欄干邊，兀自用手向下掃着呢。積之連忙跳起來道；這樓底下有人啦。那護兵伸頭對樓下看着，格格的一笑，也沒有說什麽，竟自走了。趙翁於是站了起來，撲去身上的瓜子壳，低聲向積之笑道：還好，並沒有弄髒衣服，算了罷，我們也犯不上和這種人計較。積之道：眞是豈有此理，你不向我們道歉一聲，那都罷了，他看見了很開心，還要對我們笑笑，正說到笑，那平臺上更是三四個人聲音同起，哈哈大笑。積之以爲是自己的話，招引出來的反響，心中大爲憤怒，立刻走開去十幾步路，再回頭向那平臺上看着，原來那上面陳設了一張桌子，五把椅子。坐着兩个少年軍官，三個花枝招展的少女。這三個少女，恰是左右分排把軍官來在當中坐着。這軍官裏面，有一個臉子最白的，看去也不過三十歲以内，一手搭在那少女所坐的椅子靠背上，大有遙爲摟抱之勢。一手舉了一隻啤酒杯子，高高的齊平鼻尖。另一個軍官，嘴上養了一撮小鬍子，他兩手握着身邊少女的兩隻手，伸頭到少女耳邊去說話。那少女只管把臉來藏躱着。笑得身子如銅絲絞的一般，只管扭着，所以這平臺上的人，就全笑起來了。積之看着，便向趙翁點了兩點頭，招呼他過來。趙翁不解所謂，也就過來了。積之將他的袖子一拉，嘴向平臺上一努低聲道：你瞧，這是我們中國的軍官。現在𤍠河的形勢，一天比一天緊張，他們還有這種興致，帶着女人在這裏喝酒看紅葉。（二九一）</p>
<p>婦女的樂園</p>
<h3>女子擇配的質素</h3>
<p>— 胡楚玉</p>
<p>最近據有名醫學家的研究，對於男女的配偶問題，應注重體質的相合，體質配合適宜，自然可以生養好的兒女了。譬如：</p>
<p>一，多血質的婦人……應配粘液質的男子</p>
<p>二，神經質的婦人……應配筋骨質的男子</p>
<p>三，筋骨質的婦人……應配多血質的男子</p>
<p>四，粘液質的婦人……應配神經質的男子</p>
<p>多血質‖就是身體强壯，心神結實，性質躁急的人。</p>
<p>筋骨質‖骨骼粗大，身體結實，容易發怒，而常陷於憂鬱的人。</p>
<p>神經質‖體質瘦弱，動作敏捷，很容易爲感情所動的人。</p>
<p>粘液質‖身體富於脂肪，動作滯緩，心極寗靜，不易受感情所動的人。</p>

<p>Page 16</p>

<p>自由談笑  徐懋庸　　俄皇亞歷山大二世治世之頃，是黑暗的時代。這時代，作爲國家的俄國是成長了，然而生活的形式如舊。和官僚政府的發達一同，農奴制度也被保持得更堅固了。但在另一方面，思想也已成長了，而且思想立卽成爲對於生活的反抗。於是，在伏爾迦大川之上，洋溢起苦惱和溠歎的聲音，這聲音所組成的，便是偉大的俄國的文學。所以，這時代，其實也是文化的時代，進步的時代，問題的時代，預備再生的時代，是再生的俄羅斯民族所不能忘的時代。　　「未嘗在法蘭西大革命時代生活過的人，全然不足以言生活，」恰和這樣說的法國人似的，託爾斯泰在十二月黨員中毫不躊躇地說：「未嘗生活於一八五六年的俄羅斯的人，不會知道人類生活是怎樣的一回事。」　　一八五六年者，是克里米戰後的一年，是俄國被拿破崙三世所粉碎的一年。　　黑暗的，破壞的，血腥的時代，並不可怕，這倒是孕育新的萌芽的可喜的時代，由此可以進向光明和建設｜然而其間需要積極的活躍的力的推動。　　中國的文學史上，每逢喪亂的時代，文學也特别發達。然而中國的文人，向多「但坐觀於時變，本無情於急難。」故東漢末年的王粲，只說：「西京亂無象，豺虎方　患，復棄中國去，遠身適荆蠻。」（七哀詩）或云：「惟日月之逾邁兮，俟河淸其未極」。（登樓賦）。無非一點「㣼怛憯惻」之意。庾信的「哀江南賦」，也只是些「危苦之词，以悲哀爲主」，雖有「用無賴之子弟，舉江東而全棄，惜天下之一家，遭東南之反氣，以鶉首而賜秦，天何爲而此醉」這樣的憤慨，到底也只能「但悲身世，無處求生，每念王室，自然流涕。」　　在喪亂的時代中，最深於個人的身世之感，發爲詞賦，僅以作忘憂之用，這種文學是消極的，沒有方量。這是對於舊時代的薤露歌，也是被時代所淘汰的弱者的自輓詩。　　喪亂的時代固使人憂鬱，但憂鬱並不能藉憂鬱解放，解放o憂鬱的惟有笑。自十八世紀末到十九世紀的俄國的譏刺文學，卽是以笑去解放憂鬱的。日人片上伸說：「凡可笑者，不中懼。至少，在可笑者之前，並無慴伏的必要了。凡笑者，立於那成爲笑的對象的可笑者之上，凡可笑者，便見得渺小，無聊。一被果戈里所描冩，地主也失其怖人之力；一被果戈里所描冩，而官僚也將其愚昧曝露了。笑，使農奴制度和官僚政治的幻影消滅了。笑，是破壞；笑，是否定的力。」　　至少，凡笑者，就表現着他尙有生活的膽和力。有爲的新靑年，實當從能笑的人們中求之。不但要能幽默地微笑，還要能盡情地大笑。鬥牛  曹聚仁　　愛好新刺激的小市民，大槪是健忘的。　　十年前，由金華運牛到上海，舉行鬥賽，哄動了一時。沒多時大家都失望了，門票五元，只看見兩牛相觸，平凡到意想之外。門前冷落車馬稀，約有二星期之久，便運往南洋去了。事隔十年，伴着杭江鐵路的大典禮，這老反戲又激起上海人的新興趣來了。　　關於鬥牛的記載，以陳其元的婺州鬥牛俗（見庸閒齊隨筆）爲最近情近眞。鬥牛是一種娛神的典禮，陳其元所謂「鄕氓祈報祭賽之時，輒有鬥牛之會」者近是。我們的家鄕，以氏族爲結合的中心；氏族與氏族之間，則以「神」（如胡公，關公，觀音…之類）爲結合的中心；祀神之日，（如七月十三日八月十三日九月十三日之類）參與某社（以神爲中心的村落稱曰某社）的各村落，各送牛往賽，是爲祭賽。居民遇有疾病事變，祈神默佑；一有靈騐，亦送牛往賽，是爲祈報。與賽的牛，都是牡牛；好事之徒，或就形態，或就技能，謚以美名，稱麒麟掛·鴛鴦掛·逼山·之類。（掛者牛技之一，能撲壓敵牛者曰掛。）遇有好事殷户，因鬥賽而生意氣，乃訪求名牛以逞一快，於是鋪張揚厲，視名牛如名將，披綢帶花，十六人前引，十六人後送，送往戰塲，以博最後的勝利。假使雙方都是好勝之徒，各訪名牛，各圖最後的勝利，那就遠近馳聞，𤍠閙非常了。鬥牛不勝，激於意氣，以武力爲最後解决，亦事所常有；於是以鬥牛始，以鬥人終，演出别一種悲劇來。　　參與鬥牛的牛英雄，其養尊處優，陳其元筆記中略有所述。大抵平日「臥以靑絲帳，食以白米飯，釀最好之酒以飲之。」侍候得非常周到。將出戰之前一夕，特進補品以培養其精神，更是二十四孝外的别一精彩節目，鄕中因有「老父不如老牛」之嘆！「相傳某氏養牛，其老父愛飲酒，潛取喂牛好酒飲之；其子怒曰：「牛還沒曾喝，你倒要喝了！」）這些戰塲上的牛英雄，雖云來自田間；但他成了英雄，肉肥角利，以戰鬥爲生涯，已經忘了牛的本色，更不必說拖犁負重的耕耘責任了。不過牛英雄也有他的悲哀之處：當我幼年時，「烏龍槍」（牛名。此牛兇猛如李逵，人不能近身故名）正當鼎盛之年，葉姓和吳姓爭勝時，他橫厲無前，逞一時的威風！隔了三五年，「烏龍槍」的肉已經在市上發售了。其後「大羅鈿」（此牛身體龐大，故名）英名雀起，到處稱雄；但他替陳姓出塲那一回，一敗塗地，我們又在市塲上吃到牠的肉了。前幾年，「逼山」（此牛勇往直前，决不退避，故名）出爲盟主，不曾遇過敵手，但牠的命運，我們也可以算定。一旦尖刀在左，斧頭在右，牛英雄沒落之日；想起當年鳴鉦前引，鼓吹後送，千萬人拍手歡呼，當不禁愴然淚下了！　　牛英雄有「猪羊掛」（此牛體小而善戰，故名）者，本是一家磨房裏的推磨小牛，「牛伯樂」巨眼識英雄，送上戰塲，居然旗開得勝。無奈成名未久，又上屠塲；早知今日，悔不當初，想牠必以出磨塲而上戰塲爲恨事也！「江山代有才人出，各領風騷五百年。」今日之牛英雄，又不知屬誰氏呢！夕遊  何家槐　　走出留園的時候，已經是黃昏了。　　『到虎邱去嗎？』　　『怕有强盜吧。』　　『不，絶對沒有！』一個馬車夫解决了我們的爭論：『而且晚上有月亮，來回都是平安的。』　　馬車是破的，我們六個人擠在上面，彷彿就要片片碎裂的樣子。馬也很瘦，時常站住不肯走，就是鞭子雨似的打在它的身上，它也只喘氣，並不肯走快一點。　　『還是我們自己走去好，跑得這樣慢，不知什麽時候才能回來呢。』　　『你放心，先生！它去的時候走得慢些，回來却是跑得飛快的。』　　『難道馬也知道來回的區别？』　　『它比人還要聰明一點！』　　馬夫很驕傲的說，高高的揚了一揚鞭子，引得我們也笑了。　　晚景展開在我們面前，幾條綫似的遠山，襯着漸漸灰黯下去的霞彩。平坦而且荒凉的田畝，一片焦黃，破敗的村落，隠在枯秃的樹林中，從荆棘深處，吐出縷縷的寒烟。馬蹄的得得聲，在這黃昏的靜寂中，是很動聽的。有高有低，有急有慢，連續不斷的，在馬蹄揚起的灰塵中打着𢌞旋，有點像打花鼓的聲音　　路漸漸的平坦起來，馬也愈跑愈快了，一時石子路，一時黃花路，只有越過鐡路或者石橋的時候，它才稍稍的放慢脚步。馬夫的鞭子，也跟着空閑起來。他吹着口哨，　喝着，彷彿很高興的樣子。他的口哨有各種不同的方式，過橋，轉灣，避車子，有時嘘嘘嘘，有時噯噯噯，有時脚脚脚，都是只有馬兒跟他自己才能懂得的聲音。如果看到有人在馬車前橫過，那他就很尖聲的，彷彿要壓死人似的喊道：　　『喂，馬車！』　　遠遠地，我們看見一座蒼老的古塔，浮在黃错的陰影中，顫巍巍的壓住整個虎邱，倒有點偉大的樣子。山脚下有水，有橋，有吃食店，房屋櫛比，像一個小鎭。一走進山門，就有許多賣白蘭花的蘇州姑娘，糾纏住我們，似乎非買她們一朶不行。淸淡的花香，飄浮在各處，引人遐想。石堦是很曲折的，我們走到山頂的時候，看下面只是一片雲霧，一片灰黯。星星彷佛就浮在我們頭上，仰看那根塔，雖是温暖的天氣，我却有點兒懍然。　　「啊｜啊｜啊｜」　　不知誰在遠處呌，寗靜的空氣中，往返着回音。我們也談着講着，從頑石點頭的地方到劍池，又從劍池跑到塔後去眺望野景，聽到火車的吼聲，我們更快活，像聽到天籟似的。　　『這是唐白虎的字！』　　『西施聽說曾經在這兒洗臉，這個小橋洞，是她當做鏡子梳頭的。』　　有個買藕粉的，緊緊地跟住我們，替我們指示這個指示那個，把同一個故事講了一遍，又是一遍。　　到下山的時候，看到我們一個也不買藕粉，他竟發脾氣了：　　『我跟着你們上上下下，指點你們看各種風景，却一點生意也不做！』　　『誰要你指點，再嘮叨，請你吃巴掌！』　　看到他很吃驚似的跑開去，我們很大聲的笑了起來，笑聲在错黯中蕩漾。　　重新坐上馬車的時候，我們再戀戀不捨似的回顧虎邱一次，覺得它在迷濛的夜色中，特别的淸幽深遠。　　這時月色已經灑滿了一地。韋爾斯的預言：一九三五年中日大戰　記（續）  孟眞　　自一九三○年左右以來，議會政治，民主政體趨於沒落的傾向，普遍於世界。三一年，日本因了一次政變，政權轉入愛國主義的軍閥之手。他們的軍事以拿破侖爲規範，他們以爲這是日本的轉機。他們不管國外的債券業已大跌，國内的經濟恐慌正深，他們只知道踏着西方的覆轍前進。他們以爲龐大的中國，混亂，分裂，正日趨崩潰，從前英國乘了大莫臥兒帝國的崩潰，於是在印度建立起帝國的統治。運命註定了日本的黃金時代，就將到來。這是日本建立亞洲大帝國的時候了。　　對於這種巨大的野心，到底會有怎樣的危險，他們是不管的。他們以那種建設亞洲大帝國的幻想，而自陶醉，興奮，激勵，正如十八九世紀西方的帝國主義者，遠遠地到南北美，及東方來尋求土地財富的心理一樣。所以日本的帝國主義者，對於新時代的戰爭，近代產業的構成，個人資本主義自滅的本質，俄國所提出的敎訓，以及美國的政策，中國民族傳統的統一性與精神的堅强性，都無暇顧及。他們正給一種征服中國的𤍠情燃燒着，日本軍人的精神狀態現在恰如二十年前的德國兵士。　　李頓報吿書。已只在歷史擋案中保着殘骸了，日内瓦的决議，到底因了英國外交部含胡的聲明，法國報紙並軍需業者的親日態度及一部分美國報紙並銀行家的親日方針而等於廢紙。再加上歐美輿論之缺乏統一，於是日本軍閥的野心乃更進，像出了籠的猛虎一樣，要不顧一切的蠻幹了。　　一九三五年，日軍佔領北平與天津。於是在北平，模倣滿洲國的故技，建立一華北的君主專制政體。這個爲日本傀儡的北平政府，爲了要維持内部的安寗秩序，皇皇不可終日，尤其是平津西南道一帶，到處發生擾亂。而滿洲，内蒙，山西各地的叛徒，亦猖獗至極。從北方南下的日本軍，到了長江流域，遇着堅强的反抗。指導這戰爭的是改組後的國民黨。因此，聲勢大振，人民的敵愾心，使日本人無論在滿洲及中國本部，都不敢單獨一人外出。抵制日貨運動，嚴厲的繼續着，到處是一種恐怖的氣象。（未完）兩兄弟（八）（六）  莫泊桑著　李維克譯　　「你們明天到船上來和我作别嗎？」　　羅蘭呌道：　　「自然啦，自然啦。不是嗎，路易茲？」　　「自然啦，」她低低的說。　　筆爾又說道：　　「我們凖十一點鐘開船。你們最遲九點半鐘要到那邊才行。」　　「嚇！」他的父親呌說，「我有了一個主意了。我們和你分别後可以趕快跑上「珍珠」號釣船，以便在堤外等着你再看一次。你說好嗎，路易茲？」　　「當然好的。」　　羅蘭接着說：　　「每逢航行大西洋的郵船開行時，碼頭上總是擠滿了人，這樣一來，你便不會把我們和那些人混在一塊了。在人叢裏，我們是永遠認不出自己的人來的。你覺得好嗎？」　　「當然，好極了。就是這樣罷。」　　一個鐘頭以後，他便倒在他那仄而長的，像棺材一樣的航海的小床上。他在那上面睜開眼睛倒了很久，想着兩個月以來，在他生活裏面，尤其是在他靈魂裏面經過的一切。因爲自己曾非常悲痛並使得别人悲痛了的緣故，他那種含着挑戰和報復性質的痛苦也就疲倦起來了，彷彿一把鈍了的刀一樣。他差不多再沒有勇氣對什麽人生氣了，並且不論是關於什麽事情，他讓自己的惱怒像他的生活一樣順流而逝。他是那樣感覺得倦於爭鬥，倦於打擊，倦於憎惡，倦於一切，以至他再不能幹這些把戲了，他勉力使自己的心麻痺於遺忘中，好像我們沉入睡眠裏面一樣。他模模糊糊地聽到在他週圍的那種從來沒有聽到過的輪船上的聲音，那種輕微的，在這靠着碼頭的寗靜的夜晚幾乎聽不到的聲音；那至今使他覺得如此殘酷的創傷，他現在也不過感到一點傷口結疤時的痛苦的引張罷了。　　當水手們的動作把他弄醒時，他已睡得非常深沉了。這時天已亮了，按時而至的火車裝着那些從巴黎來的旅客到了埠頭。</p>

<p>經濟專刊美國銀行業之新發展存欵保險  徐毓枬一簡單的回顧　　美國向來以小銀行主義聞名；銀行種類，是　　大别之可分爲我　州立銀行和國立銀行二種，前者是根據州政府立法所註册設立的銀行，包括信託公司和儲蓄銀行在内，後者是根據聯邦政府法律所註册設立的銀行，兩者都由私人經營。美國法律向來不准銀行設立分行，所以有若干銀行，卽有若干各不想屬的單位，平日不通聲氣，準備分散各處，一旦遇有金融緊急或發生擠兌時，銀行都束手無策。美國銀行風潮的頻繁和倒閉銀行之多，這種一盤散沙的銀行界，實在是一個最大原因。　　一九一三年的聯邦準備條例，把銀行界一盤散沙的情形，改善了許多。然而一則因爲設立分行的限制並未廢棄，二則因爲聯邦準備銀行的會員，僅國立銀行須强迫加入，其他銀行加入與否，聽其自便，舊銀行制度下的弊病，並未完全革除。據一九二九年調查，會員銀行與非會員銀行數目約略相等，這種非會員銀行，資本旣然薄弱，辦事又不審愼，又無聯帮準備銀行爲後盾，最易引起公衆不信任而牽動金融大局，一九三三年春季的銀行風潮，使美國獲得一次嚴重敎訓。　　經過這次敎訓，美國銀行界知道本國銀行制度的弱點，在獨立而基礎不健全的銀行太多，而資本雄厚營業穏健的銀行，又格於不能設立分行的限制，不能以合作方式，盡量擴充。同時，因爲這種小銀行太多，儲户信仰非常缺乏，捕風捉影之談，每致釀成絶大風潮。要使今後銀行業有健全發展，惟有廢除設立分行的限制，便利銀行的合併而使資金集中，再以猛烈手叚，先淘汰一批基礎太薄弱的銀行，增加儲户的安全，然後以和緩方法，使各銀行或皆成爲聯邦準備銀行的會員銀行，或自行消滅。爲達到前一項目的，一九三三年銀行法第二三節規定國立銀行不僅可在本鄕本城設立分行，並可於所在州任何地點，設立分行，但須得州政府之正式同意，並服從該州法律。爲達到後一項目的，政府一方面在一九三三年春季銀行休業期中，嚴格的檢查銀行内容，凡其資產不足以應付負債者，一槪不准復業，至今還有二五○○家銀行不准營業（註一）他方面舉辦所謂存欵保險。二所謂存欵保險制度的内容　　廢除設立分行的限制，在實行大銀行主義的英國加拿大等處，早已實行，至今英加二國，獨立銀行極少，而支行則遍佈全國，其他如法德日本等國，近年來合併運動也非常顯著，所以這點並沒有什麽新異，我們且撇開不談，惟有這存欵保險，確是新鮮玩意，其他各國，雖有極强固的中央銀行爲各商業銀行作後盾，然並沒有明白保險儲户的安全，這種制度，値得提出討論。　　存欵保險制度，規定於一九三三年六月十六日經總統批准實施的銀行法，該法第八節是對於聯邦準備條例的修正，其中規定「設立一聯邦存欵保險公司（Federal　Deposit　InsuranceCorporation　以下簡稱公司）其責任在購買，特有並淸理已倒閉之國立銀行及州立銀行之資產；及保險適合本節規定之各銀行之存欵。」公司行政，由理事會負責。理事會設理事三人，除泉幣司長（Comptroller　of　Currency）爲當然理事外，其餘二人，由總統得參議會同意而委任之，任期六年。主席一職，由委任理事中選任。委任理事爲有給職，年薪一○、○○○元，每月支付，泉幣司長爲無給職。　　公司資本無定額，隨存欵的多少而增减。每股百元，由美國國庫購買一五○、○○○、○○○，國家股股欵何時收集，收集一部或全部，由理事會决定。其餘股票，分爲甲乙二類，甲類由會員和非會員銀行購買，乙類股由聯邦準備銀行承購，甲類股和國家股每年有利息六厘，乙類股則無分紅權利。甲類股欵總數，應等於承購各銀行的總存欵負債｜包括定期及活期存欵｜的千分之五，據現在估計，約爲一七五、○○○、○○○，以後各銀行存欵如有增减，其所購股票亦應比例增减。乙類股欵應等於一九三三年一月一日聯邦準備銀行公積金的二分之一，卽一三九，三○○、○○○元　　會員銀行在購買甲類股票之前，須先塡認股書，公司接得該項請求書後，卽依該請求銀行爲國立或州立，而請聯邦凖備局或泉幣司長審查該銀行的資產，是否足够應付其負債。聯邦凖備局或泉幣司長如認爲滿意，卽出一認可證明書，公司接得該項證明書，卽承認該請求銀行爲甲類股東；如認爲不滿意，卽出一否認書，公司卽根據之而拒絶其認股。非會員銀行亦經過同樣手續而爲甲類股東。但從一九三六年七月一日起，非會員銀行在未改變爲會員以前，不得爲甲類股東而享受公司各種權利，其在一九三六年七月以前已爲甲類股東而在七月以後並未改變爲會員銀行者，公司卽退還其股欵而停止其一切應享權利。　　假使州立會員銀行，因所在州法律的限制，不能購買公司股票而爲甲類股東時，可請求公司准其享受保險利益，如經公司核准，卽須以相當於該銀行存欵總數千分之五的欵項，存於公司，由後者每年給與六厘利息，而享受甲類股東的利益。以後該銀行存欵負債如有增减，其在公司的存欵，也應依千分之五的比例而增减。　　如在一九三四年七月一日以前，國立會員銀行尙未爲甲類股東時，泉幣司長得依照法律規定，指定一接班人，接收該銀行，非經該銀行變爲甲類股東後，不准復業。假使是州立會員銀行，則除非因上述所在州法律關係，得特别以存欵方法通融外，卽停止其會員銀行資格。　　本法從一九三四年七月一日實行，從該時期起，卽收集甲乙二類股本二分之一建立永久基金，其餘二分之一，由理事會隨時議决召集。凡甲類股東銀行存欵在一○·○○○元以下的儲户，給與百分之百的保險，凡自一○·○○○元至五○·○○○元者，保險百分之七十五，凡在五○·○○○元以上者，保險百分之五十。從一九三四年七月一日至同年六月三十日爲試辦保險時期，先設立一臨時基金，由各會員銀行出資相當於各銀行存欵總數千分之五的欵項，先付二分之一，其餘二分之一，在基金不足時收集。非會員銀行得公司同意，遵照規則繳淸欵項後，亦爲臨時基金的一份子。凡爲臨時基金一份子的銀行，在試辦時期，其儲户存欵在二·五○○元以下者，全部保險。在一九三四年七月以前，公司應估計除去一切開支和負債後，臨時基金還剩餘若干，而以公平方法，攤還各銀行。從此以後，凡爲臨時基金一份子的銀行，甲類股東銀行，或不能爲甲類股東而在公司有特别存欵的會員銀行，換言之，就是能享受被保險權利的銀行，因各種原因而倒閉時，泉幣司長卽指定公司爲倒閉銀行的接收人，公司應立刻籌劃一新銀行，承繼該倒閉銀行的一切存欵負債。該新銀行得公司同意，可接收新存欵，並經過法定手續後，可改變爲國立銀行。計受此新銀行法全部保護的儲户，在七月一日以前，佔會員銀行儲户總數百分之九六·五，在七月一日以後，佔百分之九九·三。此可於下面一九三三年聯邦凖備局所發表的會員銀行存欵總數中察得之（註二）會員銀行存户數　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　百分比　　　存欵數額　　　　　　　　　賬户數　　　　　　　　　存　欵　數　　　　　　　　賬户　　欵項　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　二·五○○及以下者　　　　三九·四九八·三八四　　五·五八○·三二七·○○○　九六·五　二三·七　二·五○一｜五○○○　　　　　　五六九·八三三　　一·九一二·一三二·○○○　　一·九　　八·一　　五·○○○｜一○·○○○　　　　二六九·九○三　　一·八四○·七九一·○○○　　○·九　　七·八一○·○○○｜五○·○○○　　　　一八七·一一三　　五·七二○·四○三·○○○　　○·六　一五·八五○·○○○以上者　　　　　　　　　四六·八七○　一○·四八八·六五四·○○○　　○·一　四四·六　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　｜｜　　　｜｜　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一○○　一○○　　　　　　　　三輿論的一般　　聯邦存欵保險公司，已於一九三三年九月成立。理事三人，除泉幣司長外，山總統委任葛敏士（W.J.Cummings）及白乃德（E.G.Bennett）二人，主席一職，由葛氏擔任。葛氏在無缐電演說中，聲稱『聯邦存欵保險公司現已組織成立，從今以後，公司以全部資產，爲每一被保險銀行作後盾，保障儲户存欵的安全』（註三）　　存欵保險公司旣已組織成立，輿論對此也赞否各半。反對者以爲儲户的利益太優厚；假使各銀行在自由競爭營業之下，則每一銀行，必須謹愼從事，以獲得儲户的信仰，同時儲户在存放欵項時，也必選擇一較爲妥善的銀行，在這種制度之下，各銀行業務發達與否，卽爲其營業方針是否良好的報酬。有存欵保險制度以後，儲户對於被保險銀行不必有所選擇，影響所及，自然增加較弱銀行的存欵，這無異是鼓勵　銀行。且一經營良好信譽卓著的銀行，因共同業營業失業而使其方擔損失，實與公平原則不合，此外因各原因而不能享受被保險　利的銀行，必不能得公衆信仰，勢必大批倒閉。　　贊成方面的意見，以爲除少數例外外，儲户每祇惑於利率的優厚，而沒有判斷銀行優劣的能力。政府從一九三三年春季以來，旣積極干涉銀行，非認爲該銀行確有償債能力者，不准復業，則現在已經復業的，當然是政府所認爲良好的銀行，政府爲表示其判斷健全起見，理應保障存欵人的安全。至於說使經營良好信譽卓著的銀行負擔其不良同業的損失，與公平原則不符，實則這種不公平，社會到處皆是，何獨存欵保險制度爲然？一個安份守法的良民，因爲要防止不法份子，而被政府徵警察稅，就是一個好例。且金融風潮，每易蔓延，平日經營良好的銀行，時常被累全閉，有存欵保險以後，信譽當然更加卓著，業務當然更加發達，所得過於所失。而且因爲要分擔損失，同業間必互相規勉，而趨於健全發展。　　贊成者認爲反對方面所提出的理由，卽保險制度實行後倒閉的銀行一定很多，不能成立。他們以爲這些倒閉的銀行，或則基礎薄弱，理應休業；或則自動放棄權利，因爲在一九三六年七月一日以前，非會員亦可爲甲類股東而享受被保險的權利，雖然在一九三六年七月一日以後，非會員銀行不能再爲甲類股東，因而喪失一切權利，然而它們爲什麽不加入爲會員銀行呢？這正是加强美國銀行界的聯繫而爲立法家本意之所在。贊成者承認在保險制度之下，比較上信用較差或經營較弱的銀行，其存欵要比沒有保險制度以前爲多。然而這個並不是鼓勵　銀行。他們指出「公司所保障的是存户不是銀行」。假使有卑陋的銀行家，藉保險爲後盾，以儲户存欵爲投機事業及其他非法營業，這是誤用保險制度，可由政府勒令休業，問題所在，不是保險制度本身的弱點，而是政府監督是否有效。　　以上把存欵保險制度的歷史背景，内容及輿論作了一個鳥瞰的觀察。新制度創辦伊始，將來成績如何，影響如何，贊否兩方的意見那一方面理由比较充分，這裏都不加推測或判斷，而待諸未來的最雄辯的事實。（註四）　　　　　　｜十二月二十四日於淸華｜　　註一　見Lou　on　Eoonomist.　Oct　14.　1933　　註二　見Federal　Reseeve　Bulletin.　July,1933　　註三　見　　　　　…　　　　　…　　　　　　…　　　　Ocr.1933　　註四　見　新銀行法全文，載於Federal　Reserve　Bulletin　June,　1933。又大西洋日刋（Atlantic　Monthly)十一月於載有一篇銀行家對於此制的意見。羅斯福的白銀政策與中國  維祺　　去年十二月二十一日美總統羅斯福批准世界經濟會議時最大存銀國與最大產銀國所締結之倫敦白銀恊定，及發出准人民以新採白銀送往幣廠鑄造銀幣之佈吿，其目的固在提高穏定銀價，尤其是美國國内銀價，以增進國内外貿易，及和緩國内政情，卽「冀得白銀派國會議員贊成政府貨幣政策，以分膨脹通貨派勢力，而免國會内發生膨脹通貨戰」；然因中國爲世界最大的用銀國之一，同時又是參加倫敦白銀恊定之一員，且從本年一月一日起又爲白銀恊定將發生效力之最初一年；故現在來論述這一問題，我想也不是完全無益的吧。　　爲闡明這一問題，首先必須明白的是：銀價低落的原因。銀雖與一般商品稍有不同，不因消費而滅矣，但實際它的本身仍爲商品之一；故其價格之高低，自然也不能逃出供給與需要的法則。所以自一八八○年代以降，一方面因新銀鑛的發見，技術的進步，銀產額絶對增加，另一方面因歐美諸國先後採用金本位制，廢止銀幣的自由鑄造，需要减少，於是銀的價格便逐步下落了。至於最近銀價暴落的原因，除了上述的原因外，更應加上現時的世界經濟恐慌以及印度和歐洲諸國出賣貯藏銀等特殊原因。　　爲使問題更加容易明瞭起見，以下不防略述近年銀的需給關係，和銀價低落的足迹。（一）銀的供給　　銀的供給，除了考慮新產出的白銀外，同時還應考慮貯藏銀之復歸於市塲。新產出銀，不用說是從銀鑛及其他各種金屬鑛中所生產的白銀。在過去各種金屬鑛中很少產銀，然因近來科學進步，能够用電氣分鋼法，由銅鑛鉛鑛亞鉛鑛中做爲副產物而生產許多白銀。由這一方法，不僅使銀的產額激增（占銀總產額百分之八十），同時更使銀的生產費極度低下；故這一點是値得特别注意的。至貯藏銀復歸於市塲，是由各國政府改鑄輕質銀幣，銷燬銀幣，將所得之銀及銀凖備金出賣於市塲，同時民間也基於某種必要以做爲財富蓄藏手段之銀出賣於市塲。　　銀的世界產額，自十五世紀發見美洲新大陸以來，已表示急激增加，迨十九世紀墨西哥南美洲豐富的銀鑛先後發見後，其產額則更呈飛躍的增大。因之一方面促進了銀價的低落，另一方面促進了歐美諸國的採取金本位制。然至二十世紀初，優良的銀鑛已經次第掘盡，致銀的年產額漸次减少，如一九一五年前後便是最顯著的狀勢。截至一九一三年止每年產額尙在二億盎斯以上；但一九一四年便减至一億六千八百萬盎斯了，其後至一九二一年止，每年皆在二億盎斯以下。一九二一年以後產額復升至二億盎斯以上的原因，不是由於新銀鑛的發見，而是由於科學進步，用電氣分鋼法從各種金屬鑛中當做副產的生產。茲將一八五一年以來世界銀的產額及最近各國銀的產額列表於下以資參考。　　（一）世界銀的產額（單位盎斯　）年份　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一九二一　一七一、二○○、○○○一八五一　　二八、四八八、五九七　一九二二　二○九、八○○、○○○一八五六　　二九、○九五、四二八　一九二三　二四六、○○○、○○○一八六一　　三五、四○一、九七二　一九二四　二三九、四○○、○○○一八七一　　六三、三一七、○一四　一九二五　二四五、二○○、○○○一八八一　　七九、○二○、八七二　一九二六　二五三、七○○、○○○一八九一　一三七、一七○、○○○　一九二七　二五三、九○○、○○○一九○一　一七三、○一一、二八三　一九二八　二五七、二○○、○○○一九一一　二二六、一九二、九二三　一九二九　二六二、五九八、○○○一九一三　二一五、○○○、○○○　一九三○　二四三、七○○、○○○一九一四　一六八、○○○、○○○　一九三一　一八九、一○○、○○○一九一五　一八四、○○○、○○○　一九三二　一六○、二○○、○○○　　自美洲新大陸發見以來的一四九三年一九三二年四百四十年間，全世界銀產額，總共約一百五十三億盎斯。其中約九十億盎斯係一九○○年以前四百零八年間的作品，餘六十三億盎斯則爲一九零一年以降至一九三二年三十二年間的產品。　　　（二）最近各國的銀產額　　　　　　　　（單位基羅格蘭姆）國　　　别　　　　一九二八年　　　　　　一九二九年　　　　　　　一九三○年　　　　　　一九三一年　　　　　一九三二年阿非利加大陸　　　　六二、一四○　　　　　六七、一五○　　　　　七三、三五○　　　　　六八、○○○　　　　｜｜亞爾塞利亞　　　　　　三、八七三　　　　　　四、○六五　　　　　　五、三二六　　　　　　　｜｜　　　　　　｜｜南阿聯帮　　　　　　三二、○七九　　　　　三二、○九二　　　　　三二、六六○　　　　　三三、○六五　　　　　三四、八○○北美大陸　　　二、四八二、三三五　　二、六一二、七九五　　二、三○六、九○七　　一、五九九·五五○　　一、三一○、九○○美國　　　　　一、八○○、○三六　　一、八九二、九五九　　一、四八四、四一二　　　　九六○、○○○　　　　七五七、○○○加拿大　　　　　　六八二、二九九　　　　七一九、八三六　　　　八二二、四九五　　　　六三九、五五六　　　　五五三、九○○　　　加利布海諸國　三、四五五、五○○　　三、四七四、○○○　　三、三九三、六○○　　二、七八六、○○○　　二、二五○、○○○墨西哥　　　　三、三七五、九六六　　三、三八一、四三八　　三、二七二、二八八　　二、六七八、九六六　　二、一五五、五○○中部美洲　　　　　　七九、五八二　　　　　九三、○○○　　　　一二一、三○○　　　　　　　｜｜　　　　　　　　　｜｜南美大陸　　　　　九○四、四○○　　　　九一四、八○○　　　　七三二、五○○　　　　五四○、○○○亞細亞大陸　　　　四五七、八○○　　　　四五四、九○○　　　　四六六、三○○　　　　四二三、三○○　　　　四二二、○○○日本　　　　　　　一六○、○二四　　　　一六○、六○四　　　　一七五、○六四　　　　一六七、三一五　　　　一六四、三○○印度　　　　　　　二三○、九六九　　　　二二七、○○四　　　　二一九、九六六　　　　一八四、二二六　　　　一八六、七○○荷屬東印度　　　　　六三、二○三　　　　　六一、九三二　　　　五六○、一四○　　　　　　　｜｜　　　　　　　　　｜｜歐洲大陸　　　　　三六四、七○○　　　　三七四、九○○　　　　四○○、一○○　　　　三八二、五○○　　　　　　　｜｜大洋洲　　　　　　三一二、三○○　　　　三二六、二○○　　　　三三一、○○○　　　　二二六、五○○　　　　　　　｜｜合計　　　　　八、○三九、○○○　　八、二二五、○○○　　七、七○四、○○○　　五、○○○、○○○　　從上表看來，可見世界銀產額以一九二九年爲最高，其後則漸次低落，這不用說是因世界經濟恐之影響。　　產額最多的國家爲墨西哥，一九二九爲三百三十八萬一千三十八基羅格蘭姆，一九三二年爲二百一十五萬五千五百基羅格蘭姆。次於墨西哥者爲美國，一九二九年爲一百八十九萬二千九百五十九基羅格蘭姆，一九三二年爲七十五萬七千基羅格蘭姆。第三位則爲加拿大，一九二九年爲七十一萬九千八百三十六基羅格蘭姆，一九三二年爲五十五萬三千九百基羅格蘭姆。　　貯藏銀之出賣，在歐洲大戰時因交戰諸國禁止金輸出，及以白銀增　補助貨幣，故其出賣很少。然在戰爭的過程中，各國已慣於使用小額紙幣及鋅等新補助幣，於是乘着一九二零年倫敦銀塊市場八十九便士大暴騰時，歐洲大陸諸國皆相爭銷毁銀幣將其所得出賣於倫敦市塲，不僅是銷毁銀幣，就連銀器和貯藏的銀塊，也都出現於市塲了。據說一九二零年一年間，從法國運往倫敦市塲的銀塊有一千四百六十萬盎斯，從比利時運往倫敦市塲者有三百萬盎斯，從荷蘭運往倫敦市塲者有四百萬盎斯。　　一九二一年英國改鑄銀幣减低成色，約剩九千萬盎斯出賣於市塲，其後每年皆有銀塊出賣，就一九二九年也尙出賣一千萬盎斯。他如德國，波蘭，法國，比利時，瑞士，意大利等，也皆改鑄銀幣减低成色，和發行小額紙幣，出賣保有銀於市塲。　　一九二七年印度改革幣制，採用金滙兌本位制，禁止銀幣的自由鑄造，曾將巨額的銀羅比銷毁出賣於市塲，據說十年間約有二億五千萬盎斯。其後一九三零年法　安南也採用金滙兌本位制，將其保有銀出賣。茲將列年來各國政府出賣的銀額列表於下：（單位百萬盎斯）年次　　　英國銀　　歐洲銀　　印度政　　合計　　　　　幣改　　　幣廢止　　府賣出一九二○年｜　　　　一八·○　｜　　　一八·○一九二一年｜　　　　三一·○　｜　　　三一·○一九二二年二四·○　一九·○　｜　　　四三·○一九二三年二五·○　二○·○　｜　　　四五·○一九二四年　二·○　一八·○　｜　　　二○·○一九二五年　七·○　　｜　　　｜　　　　七·○一九二六年　○·七　　｜　　　｜　　　　○·七一九二七年　一·二　　八·○　　九·二一八·四一九二八年　五·○　三二·○　二二·五六○·○一九二九年一○·○　一○·○　三五·○五五·○一九三○年｜　　　　二二·○　二九·五五一·五　　從上表看來，可見一九二八年全部賣出額爲六千萬盎斯，一九二九年爲五千五百萬盎斯，而上述一九二九年又爲新產出銀之最高額的一年；故促進其後銀價之下落，也不是無理的。　　（未完）商業新聞金融洋拆無變動江角突漲九元　　昨日洋拆價早午兩市同爲六分、劃頭加水因逢星期日銀行照例封關、無市可紀、拆票交易、早市轉漲、三百四十餘萬、新交易七十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易五十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解三千九百餘萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、洋押欵交易四十餘萬、銀行收解照例無市、輔幣江南小洋早市仍無變動、爲八百三十五元、午市忽漲九元、爲八百四十四元、交易早市九千角、午市一萬五千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲七百九十一元二角、午市爲七百九十一元四角、交易早市六萬五千角、午市七萬角、銅元縮五百文、爲二百九十五千文、交易三萬四千八百十串文、　　　　　　　　早　　　　　　　　　午洋拆　　　　　　一分　　　　　　　　六分江南　　　八百卅五元　　　　　　八百四十四元廣東　　　七百九十一二元二角　　七百九十一元四角拆兌　　一千二百六十三角九分　一千二百六十三角六分銅元　　　二百九十五千　　　　　三百九十五千衣牌　　一千九百五十文　　　　二千九百五十文角坯　　　二百三十三文　　　　　二百三十三文貼水　　　　　一十二文　　　　　　　六十二文證劵上週債市隨時局進展｜裁兵漲度達四元｜　　上週一月八日至十三日、華商證劵交易所、市價趨勢、稍有震蘯不寗之像、閩浙戰事、自取得延平後、頗有急轉直下之勢、中央軍直撲福州、旦夕可下、忽以西南軍隊開往閩南、雖去堵截閩共、但不免有項莊舞劍之嫌、日僑堅處危城不退、日人又有藉口護僞之舉、中央軍隊、難免稍受阻力、四中全會延期卽屆、是否能解决一切糾紛、加以政府發行二十三年關稅公債一萬萬元、雖云暫行不致上市塲、而經濟力已直接受其影響、公債市塲、初以中央軍節節勝利、閩亂至此、解决不遠、受此意外阻撓、致不能扶搖直上、一週經過、初以攻閩勝利者漲、繼以大户出籠而跌、中間以週四閩事有急轉直下之象、大户買進踴躣、七十五號及北帮大補空頭、債市發現不少新高價、裁兵公債、漲風最爲猛烈、衝出六十五元、惟以四十六號乘機大賣鹽稅、致鹽稅與裁兵高低相差十六七元之鉅、週五週六因此受其影響、債市乃爲其臨時發現疲不能興之象、直至週末收盤、二十號忽有大數買進、始轉堅昂、前途形勢、因十九路軍已退由福州、恐尙有大反動也、市價結果、計漲起一元至四元不等、其中裁兵大漲爲四元爲最鉅、成交總數計共一萬五千二百十九萬元、茲將其高低漲跌結果、列比較表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）種類　　現期　　最高　　　　最低　　　　较前週　　　　成交數一八關　一月　二九·二五　二八·六○　漲一·○五　　九、三○○一八關　二月　二八·一○　二七·五○　　新做開　　　　　一五○編遣　　現貨　三八·二○　三六·九○　漲三·二○　　　　　三○編遣　　一月　三八·四○　三六·五○　漲二·六○　三七、七○○編遣　　二月　三七·六○　三六·二○　漲二·七五　三二、七五○裁兵　　現貨　六五·○○　六四·○○　漲四·○○　　　　　二○裁兵　　一月　六五·八○　六三·二○　漲三·七五　　一、五○、五○○裁兵　　二月　六四·三○　六一·八○　漲三·九○　　一、一○、八○○一九關　現貨　四一·八○　……　久未做開　　　　　　　　　　　　一○一九關　一月　四五·三五　四三·三○　漲一·九○　　　　四二、一五○一九關　二月　四四·一五　四二·六○　漲二·一五　　　　二九、三○○一九善　一月　四八·一○　四五·八○　漲二·七○　　　　四六、三五一九善　二月　四七·三○　四五·一○　漲二·六○　　　　二九、二○○廿捲　　一月　四七·八○　四五·一五　漲三·○○　　　　七○、○○○廿捲　　二月　四六·八五　四四·五○　漲三·○五　　　　六○、二五○廿關　　現貨　四六·八○　……　　　　漲三·五○　　　　　　　　五○廿關　　一月　四七·七○　四五·二五　漲二·八○　　　　六○、五五○廿關　　二月　四六·二五　四四·六五　漲二·九○　　　　八○、七七○廿統　　一月　四八·五○　四六·六五　漲二·七五　　　　九九、一○○廿統　　二月　四七·五○　四六·○○　漲二·五○　　一、○五、九五○廿鹽　　現貨

<p>申報本埠增刊談言女偉人的選舉  易　　去年女靑年會方面主辦的女聲雜誌社舉行中國女偉人選舉，定額十名，分開爲歷史上的五名，近代的五名，在去年年底假座銀行公會俱樂部開票，結果歷史上的女偉人五名爲（一）花木蘭，（二）秋瑾，（三）武則天，（四）秦梁玉，（五）嫘祖，近代的女偉人五名爲（一）宋慶齡，（二）謝冰心，（三）丁玲，（四）劉王立明，（五）何香凝。而其餘落選的女偉人得票最多者，歷史上的爲孟母，李淸照，及慈禧西太后等，近代的爲王孝英，林鵬俠，廬隠，胡蝶，陳璧君等，在這一次的選舉中，選舉人只是女聲雜志社的讀者｜其實說是基督敎女靑年會的羣衆更爲確切妥當｜｜雖然不能够代表大多數的婦女同胞的思想觀念，可是就這近一千人的參加選舉的婦女同胞的人數看來，也就足以研究出中國婦女同胞的思想觀念和一斑了。　　中國歷史上與現代的女偉人，其實就不多，也是令人想了又想很難想出幾個値得稱爲女偉人的資格的人來，可是花木蘭代父從軍却被選舉爲第一名，秦梁玉奮勇殺敵當選爲第五名，近代女偉人飛行家林鵬俠雖然不在五名内也被選舉着，這一思想觀念所表現的就是婦女同胞對於戰爭是贊成的，所以崇拜戰爭的女英雄。其次秋瑾與宋慶齡是女革命家却也當選，這又表現着婦女同胞似乎也贊成革命，所以崇拜革命的女英雄。然而，謝冰心，丁玲，廬隠，李淸照，却是文藝作家，也當選成爲女偉人，這一表現那是說明在婦女同胞的心目中，文藝作家也是了不得的人物了。這與歷史上遺傳下來的崇拜英雄的婦女思想觀念似乎已經兩樣，文學家也是偉人，思想觀念已經大變，是値得注意的一回事。文學家也是偉人，婦女同胞已經有了這麽一種崇拜的思想觀念，那末，这在絞腦汁冩文章的文學家方面看來，又是足以自慰的事。這對於中國的文藝運動也是不能說沒有影響，一方面可以說是以前的文藝運動的結果，一方面可以閱以後的文藝運動更加對於社會有效力了。可是電影明星竟也被選爲女偉人，這一思想觀念的表現，却是什麽呢？說她是「大衆的愛人」嗎？（某報副刋編輯所恭維於電影明星的新名詞）説她是現代的藝術家嗎？如果她是成功爲一個藝術家那是和崇拜文藝作家一樣的思想觀念的表現了；可是胡蝶是不是已經成功一個藝術家呢？答案說還沒有。如果，因爲她是電影皇后，所以崇拜她爲女偉人，那末崇拜她的却是崇拜她的虛名，卽是說這一思想觀念的表現是崇拜虛榮了。在這次的選舉中，選舉胡蝶爲女偉人最是道地的婦女同胞的思想觀念的老實的表現了。理想的女人  老牌　　談女人，我本是一個十足的外行，因爲我太欠缺了這方面的經騐。　　但，我抑制不了靑春的逼促，却常常愛呶幾把嘴。就索性眞實地談她一回，獻給愛河裏的陶醉者們。至於自己。實實不敢領敎。　　我覺得，女人的性格必要異常的温柔，却不是要她馴服；也要有相當的一個個性，這個性却又不可太强。因爲太馴服了，她便不知道創造她自己的生命！個性太强了，則難免時時勃谿。　　關於思想，我只希望她有女人的一般智慧，而不希望她有絶頂的聰明，一個絶頂聰明的女人，便會像一頭獅子，她不但不會對你和順，而且會將你征服。慧性是要有點的，因爲愛情少不了它的潤澤，一個有點慧性的女人，她容易造成一種融樂的歡愉，而這種事情却是女人的專利。　　美吧，這點我眞不自諱，女人總該是要美麗的！不過美也有許多名項：有的是種健康的美，有的是種風騷的美，有的是種妖艶的美，有的是種端莊的美，有的是種肉感的美，有的是種淸瘦的美，有的是種病態的美，……………名項多端，頗難備舉。有的人喜歡妖艶的美，以爲妖艶的女人可以分外的使人窩心，有的人則喜歡端莊的美，以爲端莊的女人可以專愛，此外，人們還有各别的主張，不過都不是我的。我所喜歡的我不能拿某一種代表出來，我覺得這許多美點都要兼而俱有。簡單的說起來，就是我要她是長長的身材，無論從前面，從後面，從側面望過去都要那麽調和，那麽曼妙。奶部和臀部一定是要發達匀稱的，腿子和臂條一樣也要渾圓調和，而面部與全身尤其要配稱。　　在臥室裏我要她像蕩婦似的風騷；當她坐在窗上望着我出去和回來的時候，我要她純潔得像一匹白鴿，當我們一同在街上行走的時候，我要她像剛從禮拜堂出來的貞姑。　　對於部份的要求，我覺得腰部不妨細些，胸部和臀部則不能不豐滿而富於彈性。臂條是要長長的，小腿要好到合於標凖的渾圓。而對於面部，我的話要多點了，關於她的眼睛，我覺得是要睛珠漆黑的，卽管放點銳光都不妨，眉毛要長，要黑；因爲只有這样的眼睛，才會使你消魂。頰朶我覺得還是蛋圓的好，顴骨千萬高不得，假使顴骨高了，那眞會全部糟糕，因爲顴骨高的女人决不是一個温柔的女人。鼻梁我覺得要高些，兩頰的笑渦也是必要的，可是笑的時候，却無論如何不能張開得太大了，大了牠會破壞全部的和諧。　　啊，這眞糟了！講了這麽一大堆的瘋話，若是給留滯故鄕的園風聞去了，伊凖會報我一幅那麽醋氣重重的含羞面面孔，而且要賭一會嘴。　　『呵，你這鬼，原來有這麽一位美麗的女人在上海呵，難怪老久的忘掉了故鄕呵！』　　這眞天曉得，劈頭我就申明了。眞實的說一句、借用『我的朋友』（假借）一蘋兄的一句俏皮話：『冩稿子，無非爲的是七錢三，』時代實在太使我們不能呶嘴了。　　但我自信我這篇東西，對於當世的『情男愛女』，『哥兒小姐』，也不無有點點意義和貢獻，時代的驕子（？）們，你們盡性的樂吧！我獻給你們這一點禮物｜｜獨一步是要找一個這麽理想的女人。（完）黛玉焚稿  黛妮　　靜。　　沿馬路的窗垂着外國花朶的厚絨，没有風，垂直的。梳妝臺斜放在角裏，香粉，安琪兒，四七二，Rose，寇丹，Kiss-profe，牙刷，木梳，粉撲……百貨商店的橱窗，小圓桌，裸體美人的檯布，中央的膽瓶，一束鮮花仰萬頭。衣橱，照見對面的雙人沙法，沙法上壁間的畫片｜沙灘上的模特兒。雙床，帳門盍着，沒有風，垂直的。床前精巧的拖鞋。　　靜。　　特冩。　　五屜橱。葉雲鳳着時代姑娘，翻着三十八頁。一架無綫電收音機。小擺鐘的長短針一百八十度，現在不是六點鐘，停着。　　靜。壁爐中的火燄也死了似的　　臥房口露出半張臉，床上一個轉側。　　「小姐」。像遊絲一般的聲音，半張臉翕動了嘴唇。　　「唔唔…」　　帳門一陣瑣碎的震動，一般玉臂從中縫露了出來，紅色的被窩，一顆腦袋在篷亂的頭髮中央，那樣惺惺的媚眼，打着呼欠。無可奈何地從甜夢中醒來。　　嬌慵無肢力的身軀像被動的斜了起來胸口雪一般的脂玉微微起伏，兩顆顫動的肉球。小姐顯然是要起身了，半張臉的很敏捷的預備小姐起身後的一切，她最先的工作是把無綫電開了。　　｜桃花江是美人窠…　　小姐和着哼起來，脚橫頭的被窩自然的跟着跳動。忽然覺得嗓子沒有柔潤，和不上無綫電中的迷人。她灣出手臂來，那样的自然，抽了一枝烟，却瞧見　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　「阿菊」鼻樑中起了皺紋「六點鐘？」阿菊在火爐旁煮可的牛乳，頭也不回的說：　　「四點鐘，那個停了。底下就是繡香囊。」阿菊的態度雖然不像對付主人的樣子，然而居在主人地位的小姐，有時「是」反居了婢的地位的。　　｜霞飛路×百×××號××廣播電臺，XHHX播音，諸位要着上等絲襪，本台介紹××針織廠××絲襪，價廉物美，堅固耐用……現在請聽××針織廠假座本臺播送×××，×××，雙擋繡香囊，今朝開篇是陸公館點黛玉焚稿，請陸公館注意…　　一陣琵琶絃子的聲音。小姐早已跨下床來，跛着那雙精巧的拖鞋，香烟噴出來像遊絲似的活躍。一擺鐘擺動着從四點鐘開始。壁爐中的火燄融融的要呑噬小姐赤裸的脚踝。　　｜請聽黛玉焚稿。那個熟識的聲音。　　｜風雨…　宵…鐡馬…喧…賞…菱花…　　小姐沉默着。她坐在沙法上模特兒底下的雙人沙法上，左手捧着可的牛乳的玻璃　　右手的食指　　着香烟　牛乳的水蒸氣和香烟的氣息分不淸楚的在小姐面前盤旋，像她這時候的心一樣。　　｜心病了，難將…心藥治…凄淒細雨…赴黃泉…離了人間…未了…未了…緣…　　「阿菊，打電話到××去，黛玉悲秋，再討兩張開篇，說陸公館。」　　「阿菊無表情的走到臥房背後，自動機上撥着八｜四｜二｜×｜×　　「噲…你們××……陸公館……黛玉悲秋…噲噲噲…再討兩張開篇…謝謝儂。」　　「阿菊，面水。」小姐丢了烟尾，走到窗前，把外國花朶的厚絨窗帘撩了開來。　　窗外是睛朗的天空。小樹探着頭。　　百貨商店的橱窗，搬動了式樣，傾斜的，無秩序的。　　祼體美人的檯布在跳舞，膽瓶中的鮮花搖着頭。　　方塊的被窩放在床的橫頭，帳門微微的飄蕩，床前精巧的拖鞋。　　特冩。　　五屜橱。葉雲鳳着時代姑娘不見了蹝跡。無綫電播送着音樂。小擺鐘上五點鐘。　　壁爐中融融的火燄，像要呑噬什麽似的。</p>

<p>翁老五  士本　　提起了「翁老五」三字，漕涇鎭方園四五十里面積以内，誰人不知，誰人不曉，而且還個個人同樣地對她表示好感，尤其一般色迷的靑年，對她更有極度的崇拜！深刻底醉心！她的芳名，得有像殉情的名妓「蔣老五」一樣地膾炙人口，　　原來她｜翁老五｜雖是產生於低賤而不名譽的烟間，燕子窠小姐的本色，但是天生麗質，嬝娜多姿，臉龐美麗，形態的風騷，那得不使一般色情狂的公子哥兒，富紳大賈，艶羨神往，拜倒旗袍之下呢？她家里吸烟的主顧，猶如山陰道上，接踵而來，但是他們大半醉翁之意，旨不在烟！老五的父母，見女兒能受社會上一般資產階級者賞識追逐，心中暗暗欣喜，私忖靠了女兒這朶美麗之花，不愁將來沒有做老爺太太的福份？這樣看來，世間眞是「不重生男重生女！」呢！　　她十六歲了，正是含苞欲放的時候，一般游蜂浪蝶，個個餓虎似的思量一嘗禁　！但是，大家雖已煞費心機，從她十五歲情竇初開的時候，追逐到現在，一年中百般獻媚，而事實上却誰都不曾一親香澤，這原因是她的父母抱定拜金主義，暗中叮囑她，不論什麽人，都不可流露眞情，當用敷衍手段，這邊送情，那邊殷勤，不卽不離，若合若遠，使大家顚倒銷魂，天天來解囊揮霍，若一旦與誰眞個窩心，其他的人，豈不要心灰意頽？就不能如「錢樹子」的日日生金。所以；這般人雖然追逐了翁老五多時，化去了不少金錢，還沒有一個眞的作入幕之賓。　　後來她在這般逐鹿羣中，居然屬意了一位無產階級的，貌美年靑的小吳，卿卿我我，𤍠戀沸騰，月上柳梢，黃昏�期後，兩人携手郊外，喁喁情話，相依相偎，大有相見恨晚，誓定白首鴛盟。這消息傳給她父母知道了，就大起恐慌；以爲吳某家非富有，苟女兒給這窮小子騙了去，老爺太太的福分，豈不消滅了麽？好吃好穿的希望，也就成了泡影了！况且女兒旣經戀上了這人，旁的化錢的一般人，當然從此嫉恨而烟消雲散，不再來追逐了，那麽自己靠着賺錢的這只「聚寳盆」，豈非給他打碎了麽？她父母想到這裏，把吳某恨如切齒！一面暗中設法盡力阻止自己女兒和小吳戀愛的進展，還馬上當面申斥老五：『你這姑娘瘋了嗎？去和這窮小子瞎纏，我吿訴你，嫁給窮光蛋是沒有好吃好穿的，憑你這張標緻臉，怕將來沒有大官兒大富翁來娶你？不是你爸媽多話啊！要曉得現在社會上養着女兒的人們，誰不巴望女兒嫁給大官兒，大富翁，靠些裙帶的關係，可以升官發財，現在你偏不掙氣！去愛這窮小子，使你爸媽大大地失望！豈不要氣死我麽？啊呀！阿五！你改了吧！再要去接近這窮鬼，我就給你好看！』老五聽了她父母一番訓斥，知道父母對於自己的婚姻問題，是注重於「唯物史觀」，不以女兒的終身幸福爲前途，心中非常地惱恨，但對於小吳的關係，也不以父母的阻止而加以廢棄，仍舊天天和他接近着。　　霹靂一聲，一個月之後，老五的父母，竟用迅雷不及掩耳之手段，把她嫁給一位年已花甲，百萬家財的唐老頭兒做五姨太太，老五悲痛了，老五哭了。但在「蕭蕭白髮伴紅妝」的事實下，老五的父母的「老爺太太」的希望，也就實現了。毛哥哥寶妹妹同遊世界  猛安居樂業太陽打扮上山尖。我騎牛背你来牽！山歌莫打農人苦；要唱豐收苦　甜！太阳步步向上升，農人辛苦把田耕；耕得禾苗出白米，　能　　有錢人。太陽窗外笑哈哈。媽媽成日紡棉紗；織出布来市上賣，價錢猶不及棉花！紅薯山芋一　鍋；窮人有吃便快樂，留着　米　　稅，免得爺爺　見　！小說獄中記（九）  車輪十日　　昨天的一段日記剛剛冩好｜｜「三百九十三」｜｜喊我底番號聲在小鐵窗中傳來，我本能地隨着這聲音落下而立起來。是林看守長。　　「一定是你的報吿打壞了！」小胖是曉得我打這報吿的｜｜這時候他們已從工塲裏回來，白天是只有我單獨地留在這四朶堅壁築成的籠中。　　「壞了｜｜這似乎很緊急！」長脚是坐過好幾處牢的，他的經騐吿訴他在這上燈以後來提人，一定是一件嚴重的事情。　　「什麽？」是太爺和猢狲這樣問。　　「沒有什麽，打了一張報吿。」｜｜　則我的回答很冷靜，却是有點慌；我想眼前虧是要吃了。　　林看守長喊了我番號後就去拿鑰匙，在上燈以後在各看守手中的鑰匙是被收掉的。所以我們還有了這一個談話的機會。　　「不要慌，心定些。」長脚對我說。確實我是用抖動的手在穿我的皮鞋了。因在號子裏是穿拖鞋或赤脚的。　　「趕緊出來！沒有事你却要弄些出來？」林看守長在小鐡窗裏投進了這二句話就交鑰匙給看守去開門。他那一句話似乎壓倒了我們紛紛的議論，一致都靜默起來。因爲在我是恐怖逼近了，在他們也傳染到了這恐怖。　　李班長開好了門，站在門旁，挺一挺腰，拿手一揮｜｜「出來！」這一聲堅硬而嚴肅。　　走出門，聽不到一點聲音，似乎全弄都染到了恐怖的氣息而沉默了，沒有一個人問一句爲了什麽。　　我們走到鐡門口他們却騷動起來｜｜「安分些！自愛些！」李班長的聲音與它的回聲同時在我們背後襲來，似乎變得雄渾些了。　　走過智安監到大中央崗，一點聲息都沒有，不能不感服狗的威力，把這許多人的細話聲也鎭壓到肚子裏去了。　　我們的皮鞋聲特特地在靜默中通過，穿進了每個號子的每隻耳朶，帶着威脅的氣質。差不多在這裏的每個犯人養成了一種本能，聽到了皮鞋聲就靜默下來，因他知道長官到了。　　在我此時通過的世界很陌生，到了這裏難已三年，但是第一次看到電燈所隠約照亮的監衖，這樣陰森，沉靜，幽深如墓穴，在黑暗中透出蒼黃色的電光，使它周圍的白壁也悽慘地蒼黃了一塊的這一種太近乎墓穴的情景。我們似乎在死境中夢中通過它。　　但我腦袋思索的是怎麽應付當前的事情。　　我在前，他在後，互相沉默着走。　　此時的環境我覺得有了個很大的改變，在我很新鮮，因爲我們差不多終八在監房内，每天平均不到二分鐘在外面，環境絶無改變，三年一樣｜｜這時我像走到了個不可能走去的境地裏了。時代精神  何處去　　要是一一般人可以容許我這樣說，前此一個時代是以貴族官階來眩耀的，那么目前這個時代便是以金錢來眩耀的朝代了。假使沒有經過那種前此一個朝代伯人，對于那種穿著一襲破敗的貴族衣冠也昂然地赴著名貴的宴會，和著名貴的仕女肆意地高談起來的人，怕莫有點怪異罷？不過這種怪異也是當然的。因為你打經太平洋，全家福，一枝香。。。。。的門前去看看，看在那里面進出的人是不是以是些穿著破舊的衣服而沒有　錢的人呢？有人笑著羅克惠羅，說他的祖上來到美洲的時候，祇是一個背著黃包袱的窮光蛋，然而他是活不以為恥的。因為羅克惠羅的祖上到底是羅克惠羅。而羅克惠羅卻是有錢的，是世界上各種男人各種女人眼巴巴想和他攀仰想和他親近的闊人。這樣的時代本是有了錢便是有了勢的。不怕你是阿毛阿狗張三李四，祇要你有錢，你便可以在這世界上昂然著橫行著。那管你今朝宴會的錢是那裹來的，然而這個被　你招請來的上客，卻不能不竭力地向你恭維和攀仰起來，為的是，領受下你那名貴的餐宴。自己吃了別人一頓即無將人家恭維著的事情，像是很像好笑的，但是要𣇈得這通是所謂時代的精神。我們對於牠是祇有景仰著和讚嘆著的。</p>

<p>電影專刊一封澳洲的通訊英國片和美國片的宣戰（上）  引西　　這是好萊塢一位電影記者哈雷喀爾（Harry　Carr)的通信。他現在週遊世界，用他美國人的眼光，觀察各國影業的現狀，以及調查美國出品在各國的盛衰。他去年曾到過上海。他從上海冩的通訊，記者亦曾譯載去年十月二十二日本刋。他現在已經跑到澳洲，在雪泥（Sydney）冩了一封通訊，現在把它譯在下面：　　「我現在在澳洲的雪泥埠。這裏正和美國影片有劇烈的戰爭。有幾家電影院，每次開映，總登著極長的廣告，勸吿大家要看英國片，好保障「我們的這個帝國，」而每次閉幕的時候，又一定要將英皇喬治的像片，胸前掛了兩排的勳章，放映一次，以激勵一般觀衆愛國之心。有一張英國片（Be　Mine　Tonight)在這裏樹立了影片賣座的新紀錄。它竟接連放映了五個月之久。他們說那是在倫敦拍的英國片子。男主角呌Jan　Kiepura；女主角呌Magda　Schneider。兩個都是很好的英國姓名，但是男主角說話時，還帶些羅馬尼亞的口音，而女主角竟口齒倔强像德國人。原來他們一個是羅馬尼亞人，一个是德國人。　　有一次在茂爾本大學（Melbourne　University），一個英國戲劇家，發表了一篇談話。他說英國片子怎樣怎樣糟，英國攝影家怎樣笨，使頂好看的女人，都給他們拍壞了。結果他大受攻擊，學生們憤恨得差不多要將他拉得肢骸分裂。照事實而論，英國的製片家，常常尋到了一個好演員，不知道應用，結果就被美國人偷去了。英國的著名女伶，像第亞娜温　（Diana　Wynyard），伊麗莎蘭第（Elissa　Landi），朋尼妲休姆(Benita　Hume)，薩里瑪麗遮（SariMaritza)等等，一個一個都被美國吸收去了。原因就在英國人不懂得天才。　　我在此地看看好幾張英國片子，實在覺得幼穉。他們所用的技巧，還是美國自傳時代所用的方式。他們用表演的故事，往往無法連絡一貫。遇到不接氣的時候，常常來一幕茶話會，兩個婦人高聲談著：「我起詹姆士快要和愛麗絲發生戀愛了」｜使觀衆得到很顯然笨拙的一種指示。我們影戲幼穉的時候，往往有不合邏輯，不現實的地方。我昨夜看見一張片子。片裏那個女角，據說係唱片公司的一個售品員，但她竟穿了巴黎的時裝，自己開著大汽車！英國片有一樣優點。他們所採取的外景極好，常常有瑞士的阿爾柏斯山景，或意大利的水鄕，可以看得到。可惜許多人不喜歡看風景。他們說：「我們看看風景，我們去專看風景片好了。」　　　　　　（未完）影片談評評「吉地」  凌鶴｜天一公司出品，卡爾登戲院映｜　　（一）　　看完了「吉地」之後，我不能不爲中國電影惋惜。現在我得於正文之前，對天一公司貢獻一點淺薄的意見。　　中國電影界經常攝製有聲片的，只有天一公司佔着數量上的最多數，因此，許多喜歡有聲影片的觀衆，都對於天一公司懷着一種希望；在可能範圍中，滿足觀衆的需要。所以，我們希望天一公司以極愼重的極誠懇的態度來從事作品的改善。反之，如草率地製作影片，而作者又不能虛懷若谷的從事最低限度的藝術上的修養，那末，所有的作品，不能獲得可能程度的成功，乃是必然的結果。　　（二）　　先從故事方面說起，　　什麽是「吉地」的主題？破除迷信，改良農村。｜｜這是我們可從作品上推測其作者之本意的。但是作者却沒有對於這兩個問題先有正確的觀察和深刻的研究，因此所表現出來的不免淺薄，至於有意的歪曲，自然是更嚴重的問題。　　大地主許鴻業作惡多端，爲了想從父親的屍身上發財，不惜萬金購買風水，結果並不因「吉」而發財，反而因債務下獄。然而我們在畫面上看出來的却是善惡果報，因爲他驕侈淫逸，掘人祖墳，以致於得着天眼恢恢的果報。此所謂之破除迷信乎？反而加重了觀衆迷信的印象。　　其次所謂改善農村。我們看作者說明拜佛求雨是不對的，必須開　河道，引水入田，這的是科學的方法。然而這在目前的社會制度之下，决沒有實現的可能，除非鄕村的統治權已經不在土豪劣紳的手裏，何况要貧農阿良拿出賣祖墳的萬元巨欵來爲公益，這眞是唸佛婆婆的幻想啊。同樣，香姑的父母，虔心行善，交還所呑沒的公欵，也是使人有些不敢相信。　　至於一個村姑會聰明絶頂的在逃婚之後而去發奮讀書，不多時便居然可以興辦學校，都是和張鄕董等人因呑欵而下獄同樣的可笑。小錯誤更不必說。　　在這裏，我們可證明改良主義的此路不通，同時封建殘餘流毒的可怕。　　（三）　　一·有聲片必須要用這末多的總說明的字幕，太覺不能善用聲片的特長。卽如默片以安幕說明劇情，也不是高明的方法。　　二·整個的畫面都是故事的叙述，完全沒有電影本身所必須需要的戲。這是演出最失敗的地方。　　三·整個的是文明戲搬上銀幕，自導演以至於表演。　　比較小的錯誤，我們當然不必完全指出，只有擇要的冩出一些。　　A對白是旣生硬而且矛盾，這大槪是製作時並無劇本的原故。譬如說鄕董先對地主說，不知道有沒有「吉地」，後來聽見老大說有，立刻就知道是阿良的那塊祖墳。他如說白的無情感，村姑可說出「籠中的小鳥」一類的詞句。　　B紡花車的聲音儼如馬達。中景畫面時的聲音，發抖。　　C鴻業與二姨太太，調情一塲，幼稚之極。　　D香姑家門口下聘時擠滿了人在看𤍠閙，完全鴉雀無聲。　　E鴻業騎馬至老大家門口時的遠景，接了相同的兩段。　　F臨死的病人，居然可以坐起來。　　G監獄的佈景太假。　　H冲冲喜時的穿揷和「一夜豪華」等片同樣沒有必要。　　I農民種田是兒戲般的做作。　　假使說其中也有可取的地方，那只有那「覇王别姬」中的旦角，那一段舞劍眞和眞的京戲一樣。此外那做阿良母親的演員，演的十分自然。　　（四）　　整個的說，這和默片「飛絮」比較，固然相差甚遠，卽如最近開映的「靑春之火」，在表現方法上也比這一影片高明一些。　　總之，這一影片，無論如何也不會使人滿意的了。評「游英笑史」  亞夫Horse　Play　　眞的，下乘的美國片，到底使人厭倦了。特别是許多滑𥡴片，更是淺薄無聊。　　關於這一類的影片，我們眞不勝枚舉，卽如這一「游英笑史，」又是從劇本到演出，都使我們相信美國電影確是在無謂的消耗金錢與物力。　　當然，我們並不奢望黃金國的電影會給與我們極大的裨益，但是無論如何膚淺庸俗也罷，至少在故事方面總要稍微說得通順一點。　　「游英笑史」又是這一類作品的代表者，其惡劣到如何程度，我們固然不必以分數來計較，但它和中國小公司的出品，確是相差無幾。　　現在就故事來看罷，一個忠厚的窮漢子，莫明其妙的會愛上一個少女，而且少女是一個侯爵夫人的遠親。作者爲了要使窮男子能够和她結婚，於是便給他來一個意外的百萬家財，這樣，他們很可以如願以償的結合了。可是作者却有意開玩笑似的來一個好事多磨，男的雖然發財，而女的却上倫敦拜訪侯爵夫人去了。於是這多情男子，萬里訪情人，由美國鄕間來到英國倫敦，少不了閙了許多笑話。結果，不消說，一定是歡樂的收塲，團圓偕老，所謂Happy　eng。千篇一律的公式，到處都很適用。　　一個窮人，可以得着意外，天財。而一個鄕人知情人住址，凑巧得很，馬上便有侯爵夫人來給他們一個相見的機會。此所謂天作之合。這還要說什麽呢？這些較之幼稚的中國片，並不見得高超多少。　　導演者除了必要的使用了幾個伏筆，沒有可取之處。那個男主角，我們看過他的作品不少，特别是莎蘇薜次合作時，頗有成績，可是這一部片子，却比「桂花律師」猶有遜色了。「歸來」試片花絮錄  雲巖　　時間已經快到九點。唔！昨天花月不是約我今天到光華去看「歸來」試片嗎？聽說這個片子，是阮玲玉和高占非主演的，當中還夾着一位異國女性妮姬娣娜，更是國產片中的新鮮玩意兒，也許是一部値得欣賞的作品吧！所以，我就把例行公事，暫時抛開，怱怱的用過了早膳，兩輪車直放光華。　　一脚跨進了光華的大門，院子裏是冷淸淸的，幾個院役，在那裏揩拭座位。走向前去一問，原來今天的試片，是試給租界電影檢查員看的，這時檢查員還沒有到，我就跑上樓廳去，　　一會兒英法租界的檢查員都來了。電燈旣熄，斗大的「歸來」兩字，在銀幕上放眏出來，我們也就靜悄悄的把全副精神，都貫注到銀幕上去，畫面一幕一幕的展露着，而我的心靈，也在一陣喜一陣悲的動盪着，裏面確然有很多地方，描冩是非常深刻的，　　當顧彬帶着他的外國太太進門時，突然發現了他的前妻還活在間人，那一種侷促不安的狀態，的確是難以形容。花月喊着道：「高占非在開六路圓路電車了。」高占非聽得這句話，也不覺笑起來了。　　銀幕上，當　走失時，有這麽兩句對白：黛娜說·「一個孩子失去了母親，多麽可憐。」顧彬（占非飾）說：「一個母親失去了孩子，更可憐呢。」不料座位上的高占非喊起來說：「一個漢子失去了老婆，那才是眞正可憐呢。」大槪是因爲高倩蘋這兩天到南京去表演高君有點感覺生活單調嗎？我不由笑起來了　　當高占非和那外國女星接吻的時候，座中有人喊着Too　Short，還有一位坐在占非旁邊的朋友，詢問占非異國女子的吻，可够味不够味，於是又引得大家笑起來了，　　以母性之愛，克服男女之愛，以解决兩性的糾紛，來作本片的結束，這是很别開生面的。電影小說歌壇雙絶The　Cat　and　the　Fiddle(六)  墨塵　　道達對着維克多道：「我年輕的時候，玩弄女人的事情，做得多了。我曾將她們遺棄……我曾使他們傷心……我曾做種種殘酷的行爲。但是我未曾糟塌一個女人的前程。我從來沒有使一個女人在她最紅的時候，放棄了一切，去陪我在小房子裏啃麵面皮。」他的眼睛，惡狠狠地釘着維克多。他又帶着譏嘲說道：「要是你不是眞心愛她的話，那就不用說了。」維克我生氣道：「我愛她，比愛世界的一切還要厲害……就因爲我愛她太深的緣故，所以我要爲她而工作，爲她而夢想……」道達冷冷地笑道：「維克多，你自己不想想，你多麽自私自利呀。我勸你，還是一個人回去吧。等到你完成了你的小歌劇……號時候巴黎全城都在你的脚底下了，那時候你還可以和她平分着你的成功。但是你的貧窮…那好，」他聳着肩膀道：「當然，聽不聽由你。」　　維克多聽了道達的一番話，他好象恍然大悟似的。他的眼光亦變換了。他現在所看見的是樓頂層的一間小房子……裏面幾件破舊的傢俱……饑餓……寒冷……他怎忍呌先莉放棄了她現在所已經得到的一切榮華，去跟他過苦日子呢？於是他的眼步慢慢移動，去尋先莉去了。這時候，先莉正在裝理行裝。維克多跑了進去。他聽了她的聲音，使他的臉色都灰白了，因爲她正在唱着他的歌曲。他一時爲難起來，覺得他的計劃對於先莉太慘酷了。她越是這樣肯爲他犠牲，他越是不忍呌她犠牲，但是目前又不能不呌她心碎。這樣使他有萬箭穿心的痛苦，一時難以解决了。　　但是他終究照了他預定的計劃行了。他裝着很冷淡的神氣，對先莉说道：「先莉，我的計劃變更了。我不能再瞞你了。」「瞞我？」先莉抬起頭來看着他，有些莫名其妙了。維克多道：「我願意一個人去，我願意自由些。」他嘴裏這麽說，心理却懇求着她同去。「維克多」！她的聲音可怕起來了，「奇怪的很，你怎麽到現在　想到呢？」維克多道：「我們的事情，早就完成了。」先莉慢慢地跟着他說道：「事情？」維克多道：「當然，你當是什麽？」他說完了，走向鋼琴，他不敢再向先莉看了，不然他的神色給先莉看見了，會給她看出來是裝假的。他有調無腔的彈着鋼琴，慢慢地說道：「我耽擱在這裏，是因爲這裏舒服，但是現在我覺得厭倦了。呌我做丈夫是不興的。我亦不願意結婚。」先莉自言自語道：「哦，原來不過一件事情。」維克多不敢回過頭來，他背向着她道：「可不是。一切的新愛都會變老的。我們的愛當然也是如此。我還爲此講了一支歌呢。」先莉道：「我們的愛情，祇値一支歌嗎？」維克多道：「你願意聽嗎？」先莉倔强着道：「好吧，你彈給我聽吧。」於是維克多彈着琴，唱出一支歌來。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The newly appointed Chairman of Fujian, Chen Yi, believes that since Fuzhou has been recovered by the Central Government, the location of the provincial government should still be located there, and he does not intend to go to Yanping, but directly to Fuzhou. Except for Jiang Guangnai, Xu Xiqing, and others who have obvious signs of rebellion, Zheng Zhenwen, Sun Xiwu, Lin Zhiyuan, and Gao Dengting will still remain in office, with Zheng concurrently serving as the Director of Education and Sun concurrently serving as the Director of Construction. As for the Directors of Civil Affairs and Finance, the decision will be made at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 16th. Zheng has already arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai to discuss everything with Chen, and Sun will also come to Nanjing from Suzhou.

<h3>Navigation in Fujian Province is Allowed to Resume</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Fujian Incident occurred, the Ministry of Communications, in order to avoid navigation accidents and cut off supplies to the rebels, sealed off the ports of the Fujian Sea and prohibited ships from navigating.

<h3>Reasons for the Defeat in Fujian Transmitted by Japanese Telegrams</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The collapse of the Fujian government is imminent. According to official information obtained on the 13th, the Central Army and the 19th Route Army have now begun to negotiate a settlement. The most important condition is the dissolution of the Fujian Independent Government, the restoration of the original state of the 19th Route Army, and the subsequent handling of affairs in Quanzhou. There are several other conditions, which are not listed here. The conclusion of the settlement is quite possible. Judging from this situation, it is no exaggeration to say that the Fujian government has long been determined to dissolve. The direct reason for its collapse is its inferior military equipment. Other important fundamental defects include the fact that the Fujian army in Fujian has long lost credibility with the people, which is an undeniable fact. (Nikkei Allied dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Military news states that the anti-rebel military situation is like a hot knife through butter. The rebel army was attacked from all sides and had to abandon Fuzhou and retreat, hoping to resist stubbornly. Commander-in-Chief Chen of the Southern Route Army, considering that Southern Fujian was empty and bandits were rising, at the request of the people's groups, specially dispatched troops to garrison and appointed Chen Wei Yuan as the Commander of the Southern Route Army's Southern Fujian Garrison. The headquarters has received a telegram from Chen Jitang to Chairman Chiang for record and forwarded it to the troops entering Fujian for notification. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Local Chinese newspapers claim that the news of the capture of Fuzhou has now been confirmed. The Central Marines can enter Fuzhou this morning. It is reported that the 19th Route Army is now retreating towards Southern Fujian, so the Guangdong Army is rushing to the border to consolidate defenses. Last night and this morning, a large number of troops were transferred to Eastern Guangdong, fearing that the 19th Route Army would retreat into Guangdong. In view of the recent developments in the Fujian Incident, the Guangzhou military authorities convened an emergency meeting today and decided to continue to send troops to Southern Fujian, so that the Guangdong Army entering Fujian would total three full divisions.

It is reported that the authorities have also decided to suspend the monthly subsidies to the 19th Route Army. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the Pseudo-Manchu Regime's Brewing of Usurpation is Very Complicated, the Japanese Side's Ambitions Towards Russia are Unwavering, Zheng Xiaoxu Will Visit Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the puppet Manchu regime will claim the title of emperor on March 1st, move the puppet capital to Chengde, rename it Man-Mongolia, and the Ministry has repeatedly received reports from various parties, and the inside story is very complicated. There are opposing factions in Japan who support and oppose it, and there will be few results in the future. Puppet Pu and others have no legal principles, and the government has considerable methods to deal with it. It can be expressed immediately after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military officer who recently came from Chahar said that since Japan occupied Dolon last year, it has been burying its head in construction and carrying out planned aggression step by step, such as the construction of airports, roads for automobiles, and fortifications, which have now been gradually completed. On the one hand, it takes advantage of the fact that Germany and Italy are spreading high and reorganizing the League of Nations, and countries have no time to take care of the situation in the Far East. They instigate the puppet Manchu regime to rename itself Man-Mongolia in order to fulfill its dream of annexing Manchuria and invading Mongolia, induce Pu Yi to claim the title of emperor, force the signing of the Second Agreement, and take advantage of the occurrence of the Fujian Incident to seize the opportunity. At the end of last month, they suddenly occupied Xinyuan as a blatant test to observe our movements, and there is a tendency to invade Yanqing and Yongning. Recently, they have built a new road from Xinyuan to Kangzhuang to connect transportation in Chahar. In addition, they secretly send personnel to the interior to survey, or entice Mongolian banners to become independent, and recruit bandits, etc., to observe. Not only do they covet Chahar Province, but Suiyuan and Xinjiang are also their ideal possessions. Only in this way can they talk about Russia. People only know the tension of the Sino-Russian situation, but they do not know that before the Sino-Russian war, they still have to go through this catastrophe. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) At the same time as the change of the political system on March 1st, "Manchukuo" will abolish the year name of Datong and use a new year name. This new year name will be decided on the 16th. (Electricity Communication dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Zheng Xiaoxu is scheduled to go to Japan within days to liaise with the Japanese government regarding the decision on the national policy of "Manchukuo." His mission also includes the recruitment of a tutor for Pu Yi and asking the Japanese government to select a suitable person. (Electricity Communication dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese ambassador to the puppet regime, General Hishikari, hosted a banquet for the traitors at the embassy at 6 pm last night. Zheng Xiaoxu, Xie Jieshi, Zhang Jinghui, Xi Qia, Zhang Yanpeng, Ding Jianshou, Feng Hanqing, Luo Zhenyu, etc. were invited. Chief of Staff Iso, Major General Okamura, and Director of the Puppet General Affairs Office Endo and others accompanied them. During the banquet, Hishikari asked the traitors to give unanimous assistance to the promulgation of the puppet constitution and Pu Yi's claim to the throne. (China Allied dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Zheng Xiaoxu had planned to go to Japan at the beginning of this month, but because Zang Shiyi and other Fengtian factions insisted on a republican system and opposed Pu Yi's claim to the throne, Zheng observed the situation and saw signs of division, so he secretly asked Chief of Staff Iso to mediate for him. Because Iso and Zang were able to get along, after consultation, Zang and others were constrained by circumstances and agreed to take a non-aggressive attitude towards Pu Yi's claim to the throne and follow the trend. When General Hishikari visited Zheng yesterday morning, he also mentioned this matter, and Zheng was very happy, so he decided to go to Japan at the end of this month or the beginning of February to meet the Japanese Emperor and ask for assistance from all sectors of Japan in the development of the puppet state, and to discuss the content of the constitution drafted by Zhao Xinbo in Tokyo. (China Allied dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) It is widely rumored here that Pu Yi may ascend the throne tomorrow. According to rumors from outside, the Manchurian Anti-Japanese Association has offered a reward of 10,000 yuan to purchase the assassination of Pu Yi and 7,500 yuan to assassinate Hishikari, causing great shock. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Have Crossed Dengkou and Advanced, Once Clashing with Ma Hongkui's Troops, Ma's Troops Concentrated in the Shizuizi Area, Rumor is That Shops in Dengkou City Were Looted and Agency Personnel Were Detained</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Because Sun's troops were going to Woye to cultivate land, they had to cross the Dengkou area belonging to Ningxia. On the 12th, Sun sent his deputy army commander to lead a total of six cavalry regiments, departing from Wuyuan and Linhe. When passing through Dengkou, they clashed with Ma Hongkui's troops, and the battle was quite fierce. Sun's army has occupied Dengkou, and Ma's troops are concentrating in Shizuizi, and contact is still continuing. The Military Council received two telegrams from Sun this morning, one stating that the army was going to Woye, and the other stating the reason for going to Woye. He Yingqin summoned Hu Jiesan and Bai Jianmin, the representatives of Sun and Ma stationed in Beiping, this afternoon to inquire about the truth of the conflict. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Sun Dianying's troops advanced into Dengkou County the day before yesterday, most of them have continued to advance. Only a company of Ningxia Ma's cavalry is stationed in Dengkou, and the main forces are all in the Shizuizi area. Strong fortifications have been built in the area. If Sun's army continues to advance, a battle will inevitably occur. Sun's army could have detoured to the southeast of Dengkou to go to Woye, but now Sun's army is determined to advance towards Shizuizi, which is noteworthy. Hu Zongnan's troops stationed in Tianshui have been ordered to be stationed on the border of Ningxia to guard and protect the security of Gansu and Ningxia. Sun telegraphed his representative Hu Jiesan stationed in Beiping this morning, saying, "Our army has consulted with Yan to divide and garrison Woye for land reclamation, and we have telegraphed the Central Committee and the Military Council. We should pass through Dengkou, Shizuizi, Pingluo, etc., and have notified the county governments and garrisons nearby to avoid misunderstandings. I have also telegraphed Chairman Ma to notify him by air." According to a report from Sun's brigade commander, as soon as our vanguard troops passed Datang, the garrison in Dengkou was completely withdrawn, and the local area was peaceful as usual. In addition to telegraphing Chairman Ma again to explain, I also ordered our forward troops to pass peacefully. To understand the true intention of Sun's westward movement, Zhang Guanwu was sent to inspect the Baotou area. Zhang returned to Beiping yesterday to report. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun's vanguard crossed Dengkou and advanced south yesterday. Most of the infantry and artillery have also crossed the river one after another and are advancing towards Dengkou via Liangtai. Zhu Shaoliang, in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict between Sun and Ma, has ordered Hu Zongnan's Second Division to concentrate in Lanzhou, and has also transferred Lu Dachang's division of the Gansu Provincial Defense Army to Ningxia overnight to contact Hu Zongnan's division and the 15th Route Army to strictly guard the provincial border.

<p>(Beiping) A person from Baotou talked about how Sun's army claimed to be dividing the defense of Woye and sent Deputy Army Commander Yu Shiming to lead six cavalry regiments, together with the newly incorporated bandit Yang Hou Xiaozi's troops, numbering about a thousand people, to depart from the Three Saints Palace on the 11th and rush towards Dengkou. They arrived at the place at about one o'clock in the morning on the 12th. Because it was late at night, the garrison was caught off guard and only had a company of cavalry, so they did not dare to resist and were all disarmed. When Sun's troops arrived in the county, they climbed up the city walls separately, killed the soldiers guarding the city, opened the gates and rushed in, and detained the personnel of various agencies. Most of the shops in the city were looted. Sun's troops have expanded and incorporated several times, and the number of people has increased sharply. They are still named the Ninth Army Corps and are divided into six armies and fourteen divisions. (Special dispatch on the 14th)</p>

I have ordered Deputy Army Commander Yu to lead six cavalry regiments to Woye. The cavalry advances along the east of the river, and the infantry marches to Heguai Zi via the Dengkou Avenue to cross the river. They will bring their own supplies along the way and dare not trouble the local area. All circumstances have been discussed and settled with Brother Hanzhen. Please release your ties. Because Woye is on the border of Suiyuan, please order your subordinates to take care of our army as it passes by. Wishing you good health, not to be announced. Brother Sun Kuiyuan.

<h3>Liu Guitang's Remnants Flee to Weixian County, Lu Han Orders Troops to Block Them from Leaving the Province, A Unit Flees to Daming, Yu Xipeng's Division Strikes Head-on</h3>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council to Meet Today, European Situation Tense; Germany to Demand France Recognize Air Defense; Balkan Unity Underway to Conclude Non-Aggression Pact</h3>

<p>Equality Principle Must be Maintained; Portuguese Foreign Minister Declares Support for League of Nations</p>
<p>◎ Lisbon. Foreign Minister Gairo da Mata issued a statement to the press, expressing his trust in the League of Nations. He stated that although Japan and Germany have withdrawn, and Italy threatens to do so as well, the League of Nations still has 51 member states. If Britain and France continue to be loyal advocates for other countries, the League of Nations will never be in danger of collapse. Portugal will always pay attention to ensuring that the principle of equality among all nations is not hampered. As for the Four-Power Pact, its function is theoretical, but within the scope of the League of Nations, it can have practical effects. This is why Portugal did not raise any objections when this pact was concluded, he said. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Request for Recognition of Air Defense; German Response to French Note Reveals Information</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government intends to respond to the recent memorandum sent by France. A correspondent for the Morning Post in Berlin reported on this matter, briefly reporting on the content of the German Foreign Ministry's proposed response. The Morning Post published it, stating that the draft response has not been completely finalized. The correspondent believes that this response will only raise some questions, asking the French government to provide explanations, and is not preparing for further direct negotiations between the two countries. The majority of the response will address the issue of German air defense. The correspondent claimed that the German response will state that Germany's request to establish several squadrons of fighter aircraft and a number of anti-aircraft guns for defense should be immediately recognized without delay. It is likely that the German response will directly state its views. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Balkan Non-Aggression Pact Gains Support from Britain and Italy</p>
<p>(London) Greek Foreign Minister Maximos departed London for Athens today. Before leaving, he told a Reuters reporter that the Balkan issue is one of the most serious and difficult problems facing Europe today, and there is now a logical hope for resolution. It is noted that Turkey, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Turkey, Romania have already concluded treaties, and are now striving to establish a five-nation convention between Turkey, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, based on the principles of mutual friendship and non-aggression, but its main purpose is to mutually guarantee existing borders and reject revisions to the peace treaty. Before visiting Britain, the Greek Foreign Minister went to Rome and felt relieved that the Italian government had no ambitions in the Balkans and did not want to obstruct the formation of this convention. According to what he told a Reuters reporter today, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon also support this convention. The recent visit of the King and Queen of Bulgaria to the capital of Yugoslavia should dispel the inherent antipathy between the two peoples and promote the realization of this plan. However, Bulgaria, since losing territory after signing the peace treaty, has not been able to forget its lost lands, and Greece refuses to grant Bulgaria a path to the Aegean Sea. This is the biggest difficulty today, but if the other four countries conclude a convention, Bulgaria should realize the unwisdom of its isolation and also join in a change of heart. However, if this pact is completed, it will add another obstacle to the revision of the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Latvian Foreign Minister's Trip Aims for Unity Among Baltic States</p>
<p>● Stockholm, Sweden. Latvian Foreign Minister Salnais is touring various countries and recently arrived here from Berlin. Some say that Salnais' trip to Berlin was to express opposition to the Baltic Pact proposed by Soviet Russia and Poland. Salnais denied this interpretation. It has now been reliably learned from well-informed sources that the main purpose of the Latvian Foreign Minister's trip is to resolve various differences between Latvia and Finland. The relationship between Estonia and Latvia is sufficient to form the basis for the union of the Baltic states, and the relationship between Lithuania and Latvia is also similar to a considerable extent. However, to cooperate with Finland, it is still necessary to find ways to bring each other closer. The Latvian diplomatic community expects that after Latvian Foreign Minister Salnais' talks with the Finnish authorities, satisfactory results will be obtained. However, if the unity of the Baltic states is to be achieved quickly, it is feared that it will not be possible. It seems too early to make any precise judgments on this matter. What can be said is that all Baltic countries recognize the League of Nations as the best guarantee of their security and independence, and believe that its authority should be increased. Their desire to form a group within the scope of the League of Nations is quite firm. The Latvian Foreign Minister's particularly strong faith in the League of Nations has been repeatedly stated in Stockholm. Regarding the guarantee of neutrality for the Baltic states by Soviet Russia and Poland, no proposals have yet been delivered to the Latvian government. The reason why there have been reports of the conclusion of this convention is that some parties have made exploratory talks, without making any promises or assuming any responsibility. Outsiders speculate and suspect that some proposals have been made, but in fact, formal diplomatic negotiations have not begun. However, one thing we should pay attention to is that even if the Baltic states become a group, it will never cause the Scandinavian countries to join. The Latvian Foreign Minister Salnais did not touch on the issue of Scandinavian participation while in Stockholm. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Investigating Committee's Telegram to Geneva: Mediation of Chaco Dispute; Suggestion for Unified Security Zone; Both Sides Expected to Agree to Accept</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations recently received a telegram from the Chaco dispute investigating committee, stating that after the group arrived in America, they first held talks in the capital of Paraguay, then went to the Chaco to investigate, and then went to Bolivia to conduct preliminary negotiations. Then, they drafted a plan and notified both governments of its principles. This plan advocates that a certain area of the Chaco be completely withdrawn from by Bolivia and occupied by Paraguayan troops as a security zone. The majority is to accommodate Paraguay's views and has already obtained the consent of the Bolivian government. According to this plan, the Chaco dispute seems to be fundamentally resolved. Unexpectedly, after the expiration of the ceasefire agreement on January 6, Paraguay refused to extend it, resulting in the abandonment of all efforts. Now that the war has been reopened, negotiations cannot proceed at the same time. The investigating committee has already warned the two warring countries and hereby submits the above-mentioned circumstances. The League of Nations Administrative Council should decide what to do. The investigating committee is waiting quietly in America for the results of the Administrative Council's discussion. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department recently received a telegram from the embassy in Paraguay, reporting that both Bolivia and Paraguay will accept the proposal of the League of Nations investigating committee. If so, the future of the Chaco dispute is quite optimistic. According to the League of Nations investigating committee's suggestion, a certain area of the Chaco should be completely withdrawn from by Bolivia and occupied by Paraguayan troops as a security zone.

<p>French Government to Crack Down on Slander and Bribery; Ministry of Justice Drafts Two Bills to Supplement Existing Criminal Law</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, Premier Doumergue declared in the Chamber of Deputies that the government would soon propose several laws concerning newspaper defamation and abuse of power to supplement the deficiencies of the existing criminal law. These bills have been drafted by Justice Minister Raynaldy. The first proposes that news violations be changed to petty crimes, to be tried by petty crime courts. (In France, only serious crime courts have jurors. News violations have been tried in serious crime courts, and news offenders are often not punished by the court, or are lightly punished.) This bill stipulates that anyone who insults or slanders members of Congress, jurors, or witnesses may be prosecuted at the request of the person concerned. The court shall investigate and verify the truth of the alleged defamation within a maximum of 15 days. If there is an appeal, the court of appeal shall try it within one month after the appeal. Anyone who publishes or republishes false information, altered documents, or documents falsely claimed to belong to a third party may be sentenced to imprisonment for one month to one year and a fine of 50 to 1,000 francs. The second bill will be submitted to the Civil Legislation Committee of the Chamber of Deputies at the beginning of next week. Its main objective is to punish both bribe-takers and bribe-givers equally in cases of abuse of power. The bill also stipulates: (1) Public officials, employees, officers, and aides who receive gifts, donations, or any other benefits while performing official duties may be sentenced to imprisonment for one to five years and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 francs. (2) Anyone who receives gifts or rewards to lobby administrative agencies, their representatives, or their agents on behalf of others to obtain medals, contracts, or any other benefits may be sentenced to imprisonment for one to three years and a fine of 500 to 5,000 francs. (3) Anyone who bribes or attempts to bribe elected officials will also be subject to the same punishment. If the bribe-giver is a private individual, both parties will be punished equally.

<p>Further Shocking Discoveries in French Fraud Case; Arrested Newspaper Editor Threatens Congressmen; Penno Arrested for Accepting Bribes</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the arrest of Dubarry, editor-in-chief of the Volonté newspaper, and Haymarl, editor-in-chief of the Liberté newspaper, in connection with the French fraud case, there have been further shocking discoveries. Both Dubarry and Haymarl claim that if the authorities do not release them quickly, they will reveal shocking content about the fraud case, which may be very detrimental to the government. Dubarry also told a Paris judge that he could name 153 people who had accepted bribes from Stavisky, most of whom were in political circles. Haymarl also made similar threats, but it is rumored that Haymarl will soon be released because his involvement in the case is not as serious as expected. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In order to implement his decision to deal with those involved in the Stavisky fraud case, Premier Doumergue, after the meeting last night, ordered the arrest of Congressman Penno today, because Penno had received a large sum of money from Stavisky for his election campaign.

<p>The General State of Japanese Rural Depletion (Tokyo Correspondence) ｜The Business Recession Has Not Weakened｜</p>
<p>The state of industrial production and foreign trade in Japan, as shown in the figures, does not appear to be in decline. Compared with other capitalist countries in the world, it seems to be living in a paradise of panic. However, this time I traveled to Nagano and the materials I got on the short five-day trip also proved that the so-called deterioration of Japan’s moral fiber has internal causes.</p>
<p>Not a single farmer in the countryside does not cry out in pain.</p>
<p>The reasons for their cries are, first, the lack of cash. Even if there are agricultural products or agricultural by-products, such as rice, raw silk, etc., they cannot be sold. The Japanese government has planned various relief plans for this, but to no avail. The so-called inflation policy has been adopted, and the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan now amount to nearly 1.5 billion yen. These huge amounts of exchange vouchers are said to be lent to various industrial organizations for "financing" to allow them to circulate their businesses. However, in the end, this cash flowed back to the banks, and even from small banks back to large banks. Therefore, the countryside is still extremely poor. Second, farmers have too much debt. We know that Japan is still a country that has not completely broken away from agricultural management, and the countryside is still dominated by small farmers. Small owner-farmers and tenant farmers account for the main component. Now, the amount of debt owed by farmers is small, ranging from five to six hundred yen, and large, ranging from two to three thousand yen. On average, each farmer's household owes about a thousand yen. Most of these debts are private lending, and the interest rates are the highest, some as high as 30% per annum.</p>
<p>The positive expression of these scenarios, especially the situation in the countryside, and the degree of hardship are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>In many villages in Nagano Prefecture, more than two-thirds of farming families do not have soy sauce for meals, but they used to. When eating, most people do not have vegetables, and it is naturally impossible to eat fish and meat. Because the things they produce cannot be sold for money, they are even piled up and cannot be sold, so they accumulate more and more, and the farmers become even more miserable. It is said that the same is true in the Kochi Prefecture area.</p>
<p>Intellectuals cannot find jobs, cannot live in cities, and return to the countryside. But they are everywhere. However, after the Japanese warlords invaded "Manchuria", a large number of officials came out there, which could absorb the majority of intellectuals. For example, those who have a considerable relationship with the military or those involved can get their travel expenses and run there. But it cannot save the immediate crisis, nor can it generally reverse the declining trend of the countryside. Therefore, in the countryside, in smaller cities, and even in Tokyo, there are many women who are willing to work for no wages, helping you to cook, sweep the floor, and do other chores. In the past, it would have cost fifty or sixty yuan a month, but now twenty or thirty yuan is also willing to accept it.</p>
<p>Elementary school teachers in the countryside generally have a monthly salary of forty to sixty yuan, which is considered very difficult in Japan. Now, they are often in arrears for three or four months and still cannot be paid. The reason is that there is no money. Elementary school funds in Japanese villages are all planned directly by the villages. Since the countryside is so poor that there is nothing to do, and the farmers themselves have no money, they naturally cannot afford to pay rent or taxes. So elementary school teachers suffer with everyone. Using "eggs", "pigs", and "rice" to pay rent and taxes was a phenomenon that existed a year ago. It has not weakened at present, and it continues to develop universally.</p>
<p>Although Japanese rural villages have not broken away from feudal traditions, knowledge has gradually increased. They have gradually understood the source of their suffering. In particular, elementary school teachers, who have received considerable education, can think and have the tools to observe current society. They can also understand the trends of the modern world. Therefore, they realized that the so-called emergency period of militarists is a scam. The people bear false names and suffer disasters.</p>
<p>The problem of ideological guidance in rural areas is a very serious matter in Japan. Because of the various facts mentioned above, the general public, especially elementary school teachers, can no longer hide it. Therefore, red ideology is like an epidemic in the countryside, spreading very quickly. Secret organizations have also penetrated into various villages. Although the government publicly stated that it has been put out, the objective hardship still exists, and the underground red movement is still brewing fiercely. (January 5, 1934, Tokyo)</p>
<p>Liu Guitang Flees Southern Hebei; Subordinates Split into Five or Six Small Groups; Hebei-Shandong-Henan Troops Coordinate to Suppress</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Liu Guitang's troops mutinied in eastern Chahar and fled into Hebei Province, passing through Pingdong, and crossing Wuqing, Anci, Guan, Renqiu, and other counties and towns. Although they were intercepted and besieged by troops stationed along the way, they were finally able to break through the encirclement and flee to the border of Hebei and Shandong. Their tenacity and wildness are truly worthy of being perennial habitual bandits. According to reports from the provincial government, since the 7th of this month, the Liu bandits have fled through Cangzhou and Ba counties, and have been attacked from both sides by Zhang Chengde's cavalry division of the 51st Army and Wang Yizhe's 67th Army, suffering many casualties. To avoid being pursued by government troops, the remnants of the bandits split into five or six small groups, each with three or four hundred people, in order to confuse the government troops' vision, and fled to Wuyi, Hengshui, Fucheng, Dongguang, Jiahe, Gucheng, and other places. The bandits were all mounted, so their escape was extremely rapid. They bypassed heavily garrisoned cities and towns and fled. When encountering lightly garrisoned ones, they took the opportunity to attack and plunder. They looted wealth and goods, and even women were not spared. Behind the bandit teams were large groups of packhorses, carrying looted goods and women. The bandits were extremely cunning, avoiding the strong and attacking the weak. Although they had split into five or six groups, they seemed to have been defeated by the government troops, but in fact they still maintained contact with each other. When one group was surrounded, the other groups would use the strategy of attacking Wei to rescue Zhao to divert the government troops in order to relieve the danger of this group. Therefore, even with the combined forces of three or four divisions of infantry and cavalry, and the interception and pursuit of the militia, they were still unable to achieve the effect of annihilation. Liu's goal was to flee across the Tianjin-Pukou Railway into northern Shandong and return to their old nest to occupy it. If this route was blocked, they would flee to Henan Province. It is now officially reported that Liu has contacted Cui Bangjie, a well-known bandit leader on the border of Henan and Shandong, and they are echoing each other. If Liu enters the border of Henan, the two groups will merge, which will cause unrest on the border of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Yesterday, the Hebei Provincial Government received a telegram from Shandong Province, saying that it had dispatched Cao Fulin's troops to northern Shandong to block them, hoping that Hebei Province would send a large army to pursue them, so as to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. Yu Xuezhong replied that it was possible and immediately telegraphed Chen Guanqun's division stationed in Nanle and Botou towns, and Bai Fengxiang's cavalry division, and part of Zhang Chengde's force to pursue and suppress the bandits in separate routes, so as to annihilate the bandits. Another armored train team was sent to patrol back and forth between Dezhou and Jingxian on the Tianjin-Pukou Line to block the bandits' southward escape route. Yu Xuezhong told reporters from various newspapers yesterday that Liu's bandits had mutinied 52 times and were the most difficult to suppress, and that their troops were all cavalry, fleeting like a violent wind. However, the three provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Hebei have been harassed by the bandits for a long time, and they all have the determination to eliminate them as a warning for the future. Although the bandits are extremely cunning and突豕, they will never be allowed to return to their old nest and have another chance to rise again. Judging from what Yu said, Liu's bandits are being surrounded by the three provinces and may become游魂釜底.</p>
<p>From the time Liu's bandits mutinied in eastern Chahar until they fled into Hebei Province, the counties and towns they passed through, according to reports from the provincial government, are statistically as follows: Huairou, Shunyi, Tongxian, Changping, Wuqing, Anci, Yongqing, Guan, Ba, Xiong, Xinzhen, Renqiu, Hejian, Nanle, Nanpi, Boshan, Fucheng, Dongguang, Jiahe, Xianxian, Wuyi, Hengshui, Botou town, Huai town and other 24 counties and towns. Among them, Renqiu, Jiahe, Fucheng, and Guan suffered the most damage. The city walls were broken by the bandits and looted. Renqiu was occupied by the bandits for two days, and not a single chicken or dog was left. Innumerable young women were raped by the bandits and committed suicide out of shame and anger. More than two or three hundred people were taken away by the bandits and carried behind the team. The rest, such as Botou town, Dongguang, Nanpi, and Huai town, were also harassed to a lesser extent, but not as severely as Jiahe and Renqiu. If Wuqing, Anci, Ba, and Xiong counties had been attacked by the militia and garrison troops, the bandits would have fled over the county seat. Only the villages and towns they passed through were ravaged, and the city walls were fortunately preserved.</p>
<p>When Liu's bandits fled into the demilitarized zone of North China, several squads of Japanese troops stationed at various passes of the Great Wall entered Miyun, Huairou, and Shunyi. Later, because the Beiping Military Commission informed them that Liu's bandits had fled elsewhere, the Japanese troops withdrew immediately. However, 30 Japanese troops each arrived in Jixian and Sanhe counties and stationed in local inns, saying that they were here to suppress Liu's bandits. Liu's bandits were not entrenched in these two counties, so the Beiping Military Commission ordered Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of Jixian and Miyun, to go to his post immediately and negotiate with the Japanese troops nearby, so as not to allow them to stay in our territory for a long time and cause misunderstandings. Yin is scheduled to go tomorrow (the 12th). (11th)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Liu Guitang's troops fled south, Shandong Province actively deployed defenses in southern and northern Shandong to prepare for any eventuality. I recently visited Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, and asked about everything. According to him, Liu's bandits were still in the area of Xianxian, Renqiu, Wuyi, Hengshui, Nangong, and Zaoqiang as of this morning. Liu himself was rumored to be still in Hengshui, and the rest were divided into several groups. The so-called cavalry were just mules and</p>
<h3>The Crisis in Inner Mongolia: Be Vigilant</h3>
<p>Puyi was instigated to first serve as a puppet executive and then presumptuously declare himself emperor. His intention was nothing more than to make it easier for the Japanese clique to annex the Northeast. However, the coming disaster may be even worse than that. The situation of armed conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union has become increasingly clear. Although the timing is unpredictable, it is undeniable that a war will eventually break out. Once the war erupts, the focus of the direct confrontation will inevitably be in the plains of northern Manchuria. This is because Japan has been preparing for war against Russia for a long time. The movement of more than 100,000 troops cannot be completely hidden from the eyes of the world. Since the Middle East Road dispute between the Soviet Union and the pseudo-government, the Soviet Union has also gradually increased its troops to the Far East and strengthened its defensive works. Nearly 150,000 troops are stationed east of Chita along the Amur and Ussuri railways. Both the Japanese and Soviet authorities have openly acknowledged these actions. Therefore, it can be determined that the point of war will be in the plains of northern Manchuria. However, the outcome will not be determined in northern Manchuria, but in the struggle for resources and flanking attacks.</p>
<p>Japan lacks resources. Whether it is iron, coal, or oil, there are no large reserves. It must find a place to extract them. Although the four northeastern provinces can serve as its treasure house, once the war starts, it will not be able to take them freely and must find another plan. Moreover, once the war breaks out, in addition to the direct confrontation, the side battles will inevitably involve our country. This is because future wars will not be the same as in the past, relying only on flat-ground fighting, but will rely on the three-dimensional warfare made possible by the development of airplanes. The attacks in three-dimensional warfare are more serious on the flanks than on the front. Therefore, our Inner Mongolia cannot avoid being affected, and other parts of the country may also suffer. Of the six leagues in Inner Mongolia, three have already been lost. The Jerim, Josutu, and Jao Uda leagues have fallen into foreign hands. If our country does not take strict precautions, the coming disasters cannot be stopped. After Japan gained a foothold in Rehe, its actions became very convenient. In the past, it was only sneaking across the border to make contact in the style of spies. Now, it has the support of the Japanese army and the cover of the pseudo-regime. The radio station in Linxi has gone from being secretly installed to openly broadcasting. The area around the Beizi Temple is full of traces of military reconnaissance. Moreover, the Japanese warlords frequently refer to "Manchuria and Mongolia" together. In Dalian, Fengtian, and Japan, there are numerous organizations studying "Manchuria and Mongolia." It is clear that invading Manchuria is its established policy, and invading Mongolia is also its predetermined plan. Moreover, in its so-called continental policy, Mongolia and Manchuria have long been given equal importance because their location is strategically important. To the north, it can defend against Russia, and to the south, it can invade China.</p>
<p>Its plan to invade Inner Mongolia has become more exposed due to Puyi's assumption of the title of emperor. Japan's desire to disturb North China has become even more obvious since Rehe was invaded. What it is concerned about is first, that our people will fight like trapped beasts; second, that international disputes will not be easily resolved; and third, that Japan's own financial problems still have many difficulties. Therefore, it cannot but abandon the difficult and take the easy way, changing its direction to target Mongolia, where our population is sparse, the economy is weak, and resistance is minimal. Moreover, the seizure of Mongolia does not require heavy troops. It is enough to buy over and transform the Mongolians who are undergoing change to disrupt the Mongolian border.</p>
<p>What we are most worried about is that Inner Mongolia has a vast territory and a sparse population. Although it is not easy for the enemy to invade and occupy, Mongolia itself has no modern military organization to restrain its strong neighbors. We are also limited by geography and cannot mobilize large troops to defend the Mongolian border. At this time of turmoil, when the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is escalating, Inner Mongolia's value in terms of aviation is very important. Moreover, today's Inner Mongolia is different from Xinjiang in the past. Although Mongolian autonomy has been established, there is no religious strife, no opposition between the Han and Mongolian nationalities, and no historical feuds. It seems very easy for them to cooperate in resisting the enemy and helping each other. What is worrying is that the economic strength is weak, and all education and construction have not yet begun. Recovery and reorganization will take time. Now, due to the urgency of the environment, we want to urgently plan for defense. I am afraid that preparations will not be sufficient, and a strong enemy will appear on the border. However, we cannot but prepare for a rainy day. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. That is the idea.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Says Our Country's Boycott of Japanese Goods Has Subsided</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to recent intelligence from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the movement in China to boycott Japanese goods has gradually subsided, especially in Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao and other centers, which are no less active than before the September 18th Incident. The situation in the ports along the Yangtze River has also recently improved. Judging from this situation, it will not be difficult to restore trade with China to its former state. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Trade Bureau believes that Japan's trade with China has always been unorganized. It is now planning to establish a large association and grant it the exclusive right to trade between China and Japan. Regarding this case, it is reported that personnel have been dispatched to begin investigations and that concrete results will be forthcoming soon. (14th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Central Government Prepares to Organize a National Defense Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government had long planned to organize a National Defense Committee to consolidate national defense and facilitate planning, but it failed to materialize due to unresolved issues such as funding and personnel selection. It is now reported that it will be submitted for discussion at the Fourth Plenary Session, and it will be established after its passage. There is news that Chairman Chiang will assume the position of chairman. (Note: The government already has a National Defense Design Committee and a National Defense Conference; this is a committee.)

<h3>Jinpu Railway Bureau Stipulates Anti-Bandit Measures</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the robbery on the Jinpu Railway a few days ago, the Jinpu Railway Bureau has specially stipulated three anti-bandit measures to protect the safety of passengers: (1) All cooperative defense team police will be assigned to stations along the line to increase strength; (2) The police force escorting each train will be increased to more than double the original number; (3) Strict inspections of passengers boarding the train will be carried out jointly by the garrison troops and military police at each station. Stations without garrison troops or military police will be the responsibility of the railway police. In addition, three reward and punishment measures are stipulated: (1) Those who detect and prevent incidents in advance; (2) Those who solve cases on the spot and obtain both perpetrators and evidence; (3) Those who kill criminals will be rewarded separately. (1) Those who fail to detect incidents in advance; (2) Those who retreat in the face of incidents; (3) Those who lose firearms will be severely punished separately.

<h3>Deteriorating Relations Between Japan and Russia; Italy Pays Close Attention; Japanese Warmongering Threatens the West; Advocate for Worldwide Economic Boycott of Japan</h3>
<p>●Rome Italian newspapers are paying close attention to the tension in relations between Japan and Russia. Numerous articles have been published discussing the dangers of Japanese imperialism. The recent report submitted to the House of Representatives on the naval budget has mentioned this matter. Its essential points are as follows: "The Japanese view of war is different from that of white people. White people want to avoid war, while the Japanese consider dying on the battlefield the highest honor. The Japanese believe that Westerners only pursue worldly pleasures, their civilization is biased towards material things, and they have no noble ideals, which is base and unworthy of attention. The Japanese believe that the Japanese nation has a historical mission, which is 'the victory of the Yamato race.' This is the basis for a future tragedy in the world. The advancement of the Japanese nation is not only backed by military force but also by the belief that it has a mission and confidence. Japan has now occupied Chinese territory and is about to organize it. In the future, it will incite racial hatred and attack white people. The danger of the future has emerged, and we must not regard it as the worry of a few and ignore it." The People's Daily has also published articles commenting on this matter. Its main purpose is to consider what European nations should do to defend against this common danger. It said: "Since the beginning of the world, when mankind encounters the danger of death, the methods of resistance are nothing more than two: self-defense or attack. To defend against the threat of Japan, on the one hand, all tariff barriers should be raised to resist Japanese goods, and on the other hand, the wages of Western countries should be reduced to reduce the cost of goods and the burden of social insurance. As for attacking, there has been a suitable opportunity in recent years, which was presented to us, but unfortunately, it has been lost. The so-called opportunity was when the League of Nations dealt with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan refused to obey the League's decision, turned away in anger, and continued to engage in war. At that time, wouldn't it have been great if we had announced a worldwide boycott of Japanese goods? Unfortunately, there was no action, and this good opportunity was missed. What is hoped for now is that Japan may have a social revolution to raise wages so that its goods can no longer be dumped at low prices. Apart from this, there is also the path of war. This matter has been brewing among the Japanese people for some time, and its situation may be beyond our expectation. As for Soviet Russia, it may be encouraged by the situation and prepare for this social revolution or war, or even accelerate its realization, so as not to involve Europe. In addition to Soviet Russia, there is probably still the United States. If Japan goes to war with Soviet Russia and the United States, the threatened Europe will be saved." The People's Daily also said that European countries should stop internal strife and should not focus their attention on the eternal conflict between France and Germany. If Europe does not want to sink, it should unite to resist foreign dangers. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Activities of Japanese Military Officers in Eastern Europe</h3>

Japanese military officers often enter and leave these countries. For example, there is a captain from the Japanese Army General Staff in Estonia, a major from the Japanese Army in Helsinki, and Japanese military officers often visit other Baltic countries.

<h3>New Situation in the Pacific; Military Base Established on Mandated Islands; British Newspaper Exposes Japan's Current Policy</h3>
<p>(London) The "Weekly Review" today published a long article by Baron Stenbe, exposing the new situation of Japan's current policy in the Pacific. Mr. Stenbe is a former diplomat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is known for his familiarity with Far Eastern issues. He said that Japan has established a large-scale naval air base somewhere in the mandated territory of the Ogasawara Islands in the Pacific, prohibiting foreigners from landing on these islands. This kind of war preparation is not only very important but also violates Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty. Japan shall not establish fortresses in the mandated islands in the Pacific, and the United States shall not establish new fortresses in the Pacific in addition to the existing fortresses. Its significance is very significant. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Explore Antarctica; Discover a Vast Ocean</h3>
<p>▲On the 6th of this month, the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun received a telegram from the flagship of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition stating that the second Antarctic expedition led by Rear Admiral Byrd flew into the Antarctic Circle to explore the secrets of the Antarctic continent. On the 4th, the Rear Admiral and four other team members flew for three hours near 72 degrees 30 minutes south latitude. The route they took was one-seventeenth of the total length of the meridian and 150 miles south of the mother ship's location. According to Rear Admiral Byrd's report, this flight observation discovered a vast ocean of 200,000 square miles, which was previously unknown. However, it can also be said to be part of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of 1935 is Approaching; Japan's Response Policy; The Navy Actively Supplements, Claims Self-Defense and Resolves to Implement Equal Ratios</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Imperial Government has established a Disarmament Countermeasures Committee to prepare for the establishment of world peace in response to the competition and expansion of navies by various countries. The committee began its activities this year. The following is a summary of Japan's attitude towards the second disarmament:</p>
<p>(1) If the purpose of disarmament is to be achieved, countries should seek compromises on policy issues and maintain world peace. (2) Offensive weapons cannot but be restricted. Japan's second naval replenishment plan is necessary for self-defense and should not be regarded as a threat to Hong Kong or the Philippines. If it is said that Britain and the United States are threatened, it is only a part of their limbs. On the other hand, if Japan is threatened by Britain and the United States, it will affect the core of the country. Therefore, if the European and American powers compromise, they should recognize Japan's claims. (3) The empire has never closed its doors in more than 60 years, but European and American countries have closed their doors to Asian nations and demand the opening of the East. It is absurd to pursue this claim and to enrich military preparations. (14th Electric Communication Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Meaning of the So-Called "Extraordinary Times"</h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Officials Answer Questions from Foreign Reporters</p>
<p>Saying it only makes the people aware</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan frequently refers to "extraordinary times" and "the crisis of 1935," which has stimulated the UK, the US, and other countries. Foreign Ministry officials and the special correspondent of the Australian News Alliance and other foreign reporters yesterday asked the following questions: What is the true meaning of the extraordinary times advocated by the Minister? The term extraordinary times is a bit of an exaggeration, but there must be trials in the rise of a country, and Japan is at that time. The so-called extraordinary times by the ministers is only to make the people aware of the current situation in Japan. What are the conditions for Japan's return to the League of Nations? Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it still cooperates in the cause of peace. Therefore, it wants to return and believes that it will be decided according to the spirit of the edict at the time of withdrawal. Does the Japanese government believe that the League of Nations has lost its practical persuasion? The League of Nations has not completely lost its effectiveness, but it is doubtful whether it is used according to the original intention of the founders of the League of Nations. Russia and Germany are standing outside the circle, and European countries are obsessed with their current interests, making it difficult to achieve the ideal goal. What attitude will Japan take to the next disarmament conference? The government's attitude has not yet been decided, and it is not possible to say what requirements will be put forward. Japan is seeking the security of the sea, land, and air, especially today, when it is responsible for the national defense of "Manchukuo." In order to maintain peace in the Far East, it is necessary to enrich national defense. How will the government adjust and ease international trade competition? Pay attention to not disrupting foreign markets, such as prohibiting unfair competition. How does Japan observe foreign countries' criticisms of Japan's trade competition? Foreign countries' criticisms are not appropriate, and fortunately, they have gradually recognized the actual situation. Some people say that the cheapness of Japanese goods is due to forced labor and low wages. In fact, it is the result of Japan's increased efficiency and modern equipment.

<h3>Saito will Meet with the Presidents of the Two Parties Today to Explain the Budget and Seek Understanding</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito has made preparations for the parliament and is scheduled to meet with the presidents of the Seiyukai, Suzuki and the Minseito, Wakatsuki, on the 15th and 17th. Because of the extraordinary times of 1935, he earnestly requests the parliament to assist the government. This time, it will not take the form of an interview but a lunch at the Prime Minister's official residence, which is said to be friendly. Prime Minister Saito will explain in detail the government's attitude. The formation of the 1935 budget is based on the principle of national defense first. Rural countermeasures aim to exert the effectiveness of existing facilities. The rural budget may have regrets due to financial difficulties, but it is unavoidable for financial reasons. He will also seek understanding on ideological countermeasures and other non-legislative matters. (14th Electric Communication Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At this parliament, the House of Peers' Fair Society will seriously review military expenditures and will discuss the issue of military discipline, but it may not be consistent with the hard-line arguments of the various factions of the House. However, in view of the weakness of the political parties in the House of Representatives, each faction in the House has an air of serious deliberation at this time. If we examine the arguments of the various factions, there are the following three trends: (1) The importance of national defense in 1935 is self-evident, but the easy passage of the budget is not acceptable. It should be seriously reviewed, and the issue of military discipline should also be discussed. (2) The international situation is currently dangerous, so there will be no criticism of military expenditures, and the feelings of the military will not be stimulated. (3) Without delving into the military budget, the nation will move forward with a unified goal. The research group is keeping silent, so the House of Peers is also unexpectedly calm.

<p>Saying that Currency Movement Cannot Raise Prices</p>
<p>Inflation is Enough to Lead to Disaster</p>
<p>●Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today spoke of President Roosevelt's economic plan announced in the Senate, saying that currency movement cannot cause an effective and lasting rise in prices, and that inflation is enough to lead to disaster. Who says that monetary disorder can increase national wealth? The paper money of the French Revolution and the inflation in Germany in 1923 can serve as a lesson. However, we are not in a position to make a hasty judgment on the current experiment in the United States and should pay great attention to it. Mussolini's remarks were made at the end of the debate on the occupational union bill, which was subsequently passed in its original form. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>White House Secretly Discusses Monetary Policy</h3>

<p>(Washington) Both financial and political circles believe that the authorities will make an important announcement related to currency in the coming days. There has been new development in this matter today. It is heard that today's meeting between President Roosevelt, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Attorney General was to discuss the Treasury Department's custody of the Federal Reserve funds as a second step in deliberating on reforming the monetary system. Tonight, Postmaster General Farley said in a speech in Cleveland that President Roosevelt's gold policy is neither what the expansionists advocate nor what the international bankers advocate. What he takes is the middle way. President Roosevelt is down-to-earth, and the people should rest assured and wait quietly. According to Farley, President Roosevelt's main political confidant, all sectors close to the White House now believe that the currency announcement, no matter what its nature, will increase the credibility of the gold standard.

<h3>Dumping Tax to be Levied on Calcium Carbonate</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry is Discussing</p>
<p>The China Calcium Factory once requested the Ministry of Industry to increase import tariffs to restrict foreign calcium carbonate from filling our market to maintain domestic industry. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry, after receiving the request, has consulted the Ministry of Finance for a reply and has also instructed the Dumping Goods Review Committee to deliberate and reply. If it is indeed necessary to increase the tax rate or levy a dumping tax, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for implementation to maintain industry.</p>
<h3>Labor-Management Dispute Incidents</h3>
<h3>Refusal to Register Seamen</h3>
<p>The case of Zhu Zuoting, comprador of the Shanghai-Yangzhou class Zhengda Wheel of the Datong Shipping Company, obstructing the registration of seamen, has been delayed for nearly a month. The middle cabin workers of the Zhengda Hongda Longda Sanlun of the company have petitioned the Seamen's Party Department, Seamen's Union, and Seamen's Branch to impose sanctions. The Seamen's General Association has sent a letter to the company to correct this, but the company has ignored it. Now, the two general and branch unions of seamen are still advising, and they are also collecting evidence such as the comprador forcing workers to sign not to join the union and confiscating badges, preparing to deal with it in an effective way.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Middle Cabin Workers</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Taikoo Company forcibly expelling the middle cabin workers of the Wusong Wheel, after the Seamen's Union overturned the solution in Guangzhou, many people have approached the company for public negotiations. The company has gradually backed down and abandoned the original conditions. The Seamen's Union has proposed five solutions and is consulting with the company. It is now heard that the case is getting closer to resolution. Because Taikoo realizes that the case cannot be resolved for a day, it is difficult to resume business, so it has agreed to investigate the number of middle cabin workers in various shipping companies in the near future, compile statistics, and determine the number of workers to be reinstated on the Wusong Wheel.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Discusses Abolishing Contractors</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute between rice carters and the Hongtai Shoulder Transport Company in the rice industry in northern Shanghai, after the Social Affairs Bureau temporarily ordered four measures, the dock workers in the Xinzhapu and Wuzhen Road bridge areas petitioned the Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Union to stop the actions of the Hongtai Company, which actually harmed hundreds of small workers. The Union is currently conducting an investigation and will forward the results to the General Association for handling. The rice industry will convene a joint meeting for discussion, as the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the abolition of the contracting system.</p>
<h3>British and American Workers Enter the Factory</h3>
<p>More than 80 workers in the tin packaging factory of the British American Tobacco Company in Lujiazui Old Factory, Pudong, were refused work after the company changed their working hours and confiscated their work permits for no reason. Chen Peide and others were sent by the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union to negotiate with the company. The company agreed to continue to release workers according to the original working hours. The Union feared that the company would temporarily change its mind, so it specially petitioned the party and government organs to send personnel to monitor, and also sent representatives to accompany the workers to the factory to work this morning. According to the workers, if the factory still wants to change the time, they will resolutely oppose it.</p>

As a result, a large number of passengers were standing in the car. Unexpectedly, the footboard of the car was old and loose, unable to bear the load, and it collapsed. As a result, three passengers standing on the board also fell with it, and their feet were crushed by the wheels.

<h3>A Large Batch of Hainan Aquatic Products Will Be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times News Agency, This Port News, the Hainan Islands of our country are rich in aquatic products, and sea cucumber is especially abundant. The coastal natives collect it, dry it, and then sell it to foreigners, who transport it to Singapore and other places, and then refine and decorate it, and resell it to our country, making huge profits every year. It is heard that there is a Mr. Zheng in Qiongzhou Island who is good at aquatic products. Seeing that our country is exploited by foreign merchants, he is very saddened. He is now planning to raise funds to purchase and operate this trade to reduce leakage and entrust the local Tongfuhe Seafood Store to sell it on consignment. The first batch of goods arrived in Shanghai last winter, including spiky sea cucumber, sea cucumber, boot sea cucumber, black yuan sea cucumber, rock sea cucumber, and Gracilaria, totaling hundreds of catties. They are all products of the Xisha Islands of Hainan and the Nine Small Islands, and the price is very low. They were sold out soon after arriving in Shanghai. However, according to people in the seafood industry, this item is of the same quality as imported products, but the production method is slightly inferior. Tongfuhe has already sent a letter to Mr. Zheng, explaining everything so as to improve it. According to news from the fishery sector in this city, Mr. Zheng is now personally guiding the natives in manufacturing on various islands. This spring, a large batch of Hainan aquatic products will be shipped to Shanghai, and the manufacturing method of each item will be improved and there will be progress compared to the past.</p>
<h3>Bathhouse in Xiaoyou Lane, Xujiahui, Also Operates Smoking and Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>The main factory is at Xinzhazha Bridge, Zhabei</p>
<p>All persons arrested are released on bail pending trial</p>
<p>The prevalence of Shanghai's flower club gambling is the best in other cities. Since the authorities of the Chinese and French concessions have strictly investigated and banned it, this kind of gambling has been slightly reduced. Unexpectedly, it has not been long before the embers have reignited. Some people have filed a complaint with the French Police Station, requesting the Second Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant for Mao Axiang, a famous flower club king from Ningbo, who escaped and was not arrested, and his accomplices, who are now in the Xinzhazha Bridge area of Zhabei, reorganizing and opening a large flower club factory, attracting ordinary gamblers who are deeply obsessed with flower clubs to enter the bureau for gambling. The earpieces that were temporarily suspended due to the urgent investigation by the authorities have also been revived to collect gambling money. The French Concession Police Authority therefore ordered the Chinese and Western detectives in the gambling arrest team to tighten the investigation and arrest, and secretly investigated in various roads and lanes. In recent days, those who have been caught, broken up, and sent to court for punishment have been seen every day. Li Jinfeng, a local resident, is 52 years old this year. He opened the Huiquan Pond Bathhouse at No. 33, No. 964 Xiaoyou Lane, Zhenhai Ge Road, Xujiahui Town, French Concession, West Shanghai. Recently, he has seen that operating flower clubs and gambling bureaus is easier to make a profit than other types of business. Therefore, he opened another quiet room upstairs in the bathhouse and privately set up an earpiece. He hired Xu Zhenghai (39 years old) from Jiangyin as a partner to specialize in collecting flower club gambling money. Three times a day, the total number of the whole day reached hundreds of dollars. He sent people to the Zhabei headquarters and also equipped smoking beds and lights for people to smoke opium. Therefore, in one day, two kinds of business were operated, and the profits were very high. Because of this, the ignorant fools in the nearby areas have been destroyed by being lured into gambling, and have destroyed their families and lost their wealth. The bishop in the Catholic Church there learned of this and hated it deeply. He immediately wrote a letter to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation and removal. According to the letter, the police chief sent Zheng Detective Xie Guangming and Deputy Detective Hang Bingquan of the Gambling Arrest Team, along with Bao Detectives He Zongyu and Cai Zongyi, and Western Detective and secretly went to the address in the afternoon the day before yesterday, and arrested the earpiece owner Li Jinfeng, the partner Xu Zhenghai, and Zhang Jinshan (39 years old) and Yang Hongsheng (26 years old) from Danyang, who were smoking, and other four people. Several flower club paper strips, gambling money in cash of 76 yuan, corner banknotes of 5 yuan, 15 cents, 350 copper coins, two account books, an abacus, pencils, stamps, two opium pipes, spare parts for opium lamps, a bag of ashes, and a little opium paste were found. They were all taken to the police station. According to Li, he denied privately setting up a flower club earpiece, while the partner Xu Zhenghai confessed that the flower club earpiece was opened by Li Jinlong for six days. I was a partner in it, and each earpiece collected about 40 or 50 yuan, which was sent by Li to the escaped Tao Gengquan and sent to the large factory presided over by Mao Axiang in Zhabei. Zhang and Yang admitted to smoking. The police chief ordered them to be detained. The next day, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special District Local Court. The Criminal Court Chief Wang Gangxu interrogated them. According to Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, the case was prosecuted against Li and Xu according to Article 280 of the Criminal Law and Article 10 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Zhang and Yang were prosecuted according to Article 11 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Then, the Bao Detective reported the process of breaking up, searching, arresting, and detaining the defendants, and submitted the evidence to the case. When Li Jinfeng was interrogated, he supplied the opening of the bathhouse, denied private gambling in flower clubs, and hired Wang Hengyu and other lawyers to defend him. The statements of Xu, Zhang, and Yang were the same as those supplied in the police station. The court verified the confessions and ordered the debate to be opened. After the debate was declared over, the sentence was scheduled to be announced on the 17th. Later, at the request of Li's lawyer, Li was allowed to be released on bail pending judgment because he was old and ill. The official approved Li to pay 3,000 yuan for a shop guarantee to be present whenever he was summoned. Zhang and Yang each paid 100 yuan for a shop guarantee. Xu Zhenghai was still detained pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Chen Zemin's House is Stolen, the Former Thief Throws the Loot, the Later Thief Goes to Get it, It is True That a Thief Meets a Thief in a Thief, Coming Empty-Handed, How Can He Go Away Fully Loaded?</h3>
<p>Lawyer Chen Zemin, who resides at No. 5, No. 597 North Chengdu Road, was still in the room downstairs in his residence settling accounts at midnight on the 11th of this month. It was not until the fourth watch that he went upstairs to sleep. When he arrived at the side of the handrail, the electric light suddenly went out. He suspected that the servant had turned off the light too early, and did not pay attention. He entered the bedroom, and suddenly the bedding on the bed was messy. He knew that there must be something wrong. He was about to call the servant when a strong man suddenly窜out from the corner of the room and fled out the door. Chen knew that he was a thief and shouted loudly to stop him. The man then took a censer from the table and threw it at Chen. Chen wanted to avoid the fierce attack, but was forced out of the room, escaped to the balcony, jumped onto the roof, and threw tiles in all directions to stop the pursuers. Chen was afraid of being embarrassed, so he did not pursue him and let him escape. He then returned to the room and checked the items. He found that many precious clothes had been stolen, and the estimated loss was as high as 1,580 yuan. He reported it to the Xinzhazha Police Station, and Detective Ding Huaguo was dispatched to investigate. He picked up two pieces of clothing abandoned by the thief on the roof and took them back to the police station. The police chief notified all police stations to strictly arrest the thief. Later, Chen Bingxiang, an Ezhou native, was serving in the Ministry of Military Affairs, and his family was living in Shanghai at No. 50, No. 305 Hubei Road. Chen recently took a leave of absence in Shanghai. On the day when Lawyer Chen's house was stolen, Chen Yangxiang went to Zhabei to visit his two friends Li Zhijie and Bu Laowu. During the meeting, Li and others occasionally revealed that they had stolen a large number of clothes that morning. Because the loot was not easy to transport out, it was still hidden in a newly built empty house in the same Shouli, North Chengdu Road, near the scene of the theft. After Chen knew this secret, he said goodbye to Li and others. After returning to his residence, he said to his wife that a friend had entrusted him to find a house. He went out with his wife, and his wife did not suspect anything. When they arrived at the entrance of Tongshouli, they saw that there were three empty houses in the alley. He didn't know which house the loot was hidden in. Because he had not found out the address number at that time, he couldn't just look at one place. However, it was not convenient to tell the driver. He ordered the driver Hou and his wife to open the door of No. 33 first. As soon as they entered, the traces were noticed. He expected that the loot must be hidden in this house. He set up a pretext and tricked Hou and his wife to the empty house at No. 47, while Chen was searching alone inside. Soon, he found a bag of clothes in the kitchen. He was about to take it out, but Hou had already returned, and his plan failed. Chen was always alert, so he pretended that he needed a car when he returned, and asked Hou to go outside the alley to hire a streetcar for him to sit. Hou refused to listen to his orders and urged Chen and his wife to leave the house so that he could lock the door. Since Chen had entered the room, he did not want to go back empty-handed. He resolutely re-entered the kitchen, took the package, and carried it out. Hou saw that he had come empty-handed, but now he suddenly got this bag of clothes. There must be something wrong in it. He immediately called the police and arrested Chen and his wife and the bag of clothes and took them to the Xinzhazha Police Station. After questioning, he learned that it was the stolen goods from Lawyer Chen's house, but Bu and Li had already escaped after hearing the news. The police chief released Chen's wife because he knew that she did not know anything about it. Chen Bingxiang was detained until the next morning and sent to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Tingqi interrogated him. After the police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the facts of the case, he requested that the defendant be detained so that he could investigate and punish his accomplices together. Judge Wu then approved the request and ordered the defendant to be detained and wait for further interrogation on the 18th.</p>

<h3>The Devil's Calamity of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka</h3>
<p>The first phase was burned and must be printed in three days</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that the Shanghai Photographic Reproduction of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka Association, co-founded by Zhu Qinglan, Ye Gongchuo, Di Baoxian, Jiang Weiqiao, and others, has made a pure vow to photograph and circulate the Song Dynasty Qisha edition of the Great Tripitaka stored in Shaanxi, and to promote culture. The remaining missing volumes and leaves were supplemented from the refined Song and Yuan editions collected from various places in Zhejiang and Fujian. The entire 6,310 volumes were limited to 500 copies due to economic strength and were carried out arduously for two years. The first phase, one-quarter of the entire project, approximately 75,000 volumes, was contracted by the Buddhist Studies Binding Institute on Gordon Road for binding. On the afternoon of the 10th, at approximately 7:00 p.m., a fire broke out in the neighboring factory, burning all the sutra leaves that were being bound. It is reported that the printing and paper costs alone resulted in a loss of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. This irreplaceable fine copy was suddenly hit by a great calamity and can be described as a devil's obstacle. Fortunately, the Association still preserves the complete and undamaged original copy. In addition to negotiations with the Binding Institute, they are currently planning to reprint it and complete it within three months. The second phase, which is already half-printed, will be published first to comfort the expectations of subscribers from far and near.</p>

<h3>Xu Shiying and Others Initiate the Huangshan Lay Buddhist Forest</h3>
<p>A preparatory office is established in Shanghai</p>
<p>A meeting will be held soon</p>
<p>Huangshan in Huizhou is famous all over the world for its scenery. Since the completion of the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway, transportation has become convenient, and more and more people are visiting. Therefore, Xu Shiying and others initiated the organization of the Anhui Huangshan Lay Buddhist Forest. Its origin states that Huangshan is named after the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan, and it began to be prominent in the Tang Dynasty. Li Bai has a poem about traveling to Huangshan. Writers and poets of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties 有不至. Wang Datong and Ma Daokun 以逡. Every year, road repairs cost a lot of money. Tourists' poems and essays formed societies in it without interruption. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, when Cha Yihuang traveled to Huangshan, he brought 500 friends, followers, and family members, which was called a grand occasion for a while. Later, Yuan Suiyuan and Hong Beijiang both had travelogues. Xu Xiake said that among the famous mountains in China, Huangshan is the most peculiar. Painters such as Monk Shitao and Monk Jianjiang often lived there. Mei Qushan also specialized in painting Huangshan scenery, which is famous at home and abroad. In recent years, the travel of celebrities has become more and more popular. However, it is a pity that it is located in remote mountains and transportation is hindered, so it cannot compete with Kuanglu and Mogan. Now, the Wuhu-Tunxi and Hangzhou-Huizhou highways have been completed one after another. The Minister of Railways plans to build a branch road from the Tunxi-Shexian section of the highway to Huangshan. The Director of the Anhui Construction Department also considers the development of Huangshan to be a matter of urgency. A thousand-year-old secret will be revealed once and for all, which is enough to be happy about. However, Huangshan is 500 miles around, and Tiandu Peak is 4,000 feet high. It has the beauty of thirty-six peaks. Exploring the wonders and seeking seclusion cannot be exhausted in a hurry. There is also a natural hot spring, the pool water is clear and cool, and it is warm in all seasons, which can be compared with the Wenquan Hot Springs in the Western Hills of Beijing and the Tangshan Hot Springs in Nanjing. However, the only place for tourists to stay is a simple Manjushri Temple, which is inconvenient for daily life, so they often return before they have finished enjoying the scenery. The colleagues plan to choose a flat and suitable place to build a summer house, named Lay Buddhist Forest, so that visitors can eat and stay there, and enjoy themselves. When it rains and they cannot go out, they can enjoy painting, calligraphy, chess, poetry, and wine at their leisure, or stay for days or months without a fixed schedule. A Buddhist hall will be built in the forest, and monks will be invited to preside over it, and staff members will also be appointed to manage it. Lay Buddhists who are addicted to Zen meditation can stay there for a long time to discuss Taoism, worship Buddha, maintain health, and prolong life. Is this not a wise career in a famous mountain and a scenic tour outside the world? This is the first step in developing Huangshan. As for repairing roads, building pavilions, diverting springs, building bridges, surrounding hot springs, repairing ancient temples, all the arrangements of the scenery, exploring mines, developing forests, planting tea trees, planting medicinal herbs, opening parks, building schools, all the public welfare measures should be carried out step by step to achieve perfection. Although the road is shabby, it can open up the mountains and forests. How can it be the work of one hand and one foot? The colleagues' wishes are extravagant, but their strength is weak. It is difficult to achieve success without calling on all parties. It is hoped that scholars and celebrities at home and abroad will advocate it, reclusive hermits will sponsor it, generously donate, and be tireless in doing good deeds. It is hoped that they will gather strength to achieve great things. In the future, when the mountain records are revised, the financial resources for development will be recorded, and the glorious reputation will last forever with the famous mountain. The whole story is described. The initiators are Xu Shiying, Hu Pu'an, Wang Cuqi, Feng Bingnan, Zhu Ziqiao, Tao Zhixing, Cheng Linsheng, Ye Gongchuo, Yin Guang, Lin Sen, Zhen Da, Ming Dao, Huang Binhong, Yu Gumin, Wang Boqi, Wang Hanhang, Yao Wencai, Zhu Jing'an, Hong Shaopu, Yu Qiaqing, Yu Jingbo, Xu Jiyu, Xu Shiqi, Yu Kongwo, Zhu Manhua, Jiang Zhenhua, Yang Manhua, Cai Xiaohe, Cheng Kaizhou, Cheng Haitao, Xu Danfu, Cao Shuqin, Wen Lanting, Lu Danlin, Wu Jiasan, Hu Laifeng, Xu Keshi.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Shanghai office of the preparatory committee is located at Taiping Temple, Chenjiabang, British Concession, and Huining School, Beile Road. The preparatory meeting will be held at Taiping Temple soon.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Campaign on Avenue Edward VII</h3>

<h3>Ma Lianfa Accused of Murder, Two Trials Concluded, Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>Xu Yongxing, nicknamed "Chai Pan A Mao," a Ningbo native residing at 49 Songcun, Glock Road, French Concession, was playing at a friend's house upstairs in Yuqing Lane No. 2, Xinxinqiao Street, with his wife, Mrs. Chu, at 11:00 PM on January 19, 1921, when he was shot and killed by an enemy. After the French Concession police investigated the murderer, they apprehended a Danyang native named Ma Lianfa in July of last year for a kidnapping case in Danyang. Ma confessed to participating in the murder of Xu Yongxing in Shanghai. The county government notified the French Concession police, who sent detectives to Danyang to bring Ma to Shanghai and hand him over to the Second Special District Court, which filed a public prosecution on the charge of murder. At the conclusion of the trial, the court found that the evidence of Ma's crime was insufficient, and also that the testimony of the witness, Mrs. Chu, the victim's wife, was contradictory. The court acquitted him. Because the police department disagreed with the judgment, it appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The Higher Court held a hearing to summon witnesses to examine the facts, which has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case has been concluded and the judgment was announced the day before yesterday, rejecting the appeal. During the third trial appeal period, the appellant is still being held in the detention center pending instructions.</p>

<h3>Invention of Glass Soap</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Yanfu, manager of Shanghai Haiyuan Manufacturing Company, realized that the development of glass advances with social civilization, but its nature is slippery and easily stained with dirt. Without proper cleaning products, it is not easy to clean. The general public has always cleaned glass by washing it with water, wiping it with kerosene, or rubbing it with powder, which takes a lot of time and is still difficult to clean thoroughly. After two years of research, Mr. Lin invented a kind of glass soap, made from purely local raw materials using scientific methods. Its effect is not only to easily clean glass, making it smooth and less likely to be stained, but also to polish hardware, making it shiny. Porcelain, lacquerware, and sanitary ware, kitchen utensils, etc., can all be cleaned like new. The soap is as hard as a brick, weighing 9 liang and 5 qian by the metric system. If used to wipe glass, there is no need to wash with water or brush. Only a little soap is needed to wipe one side of a mirror, which does not take a few minutes, and one window can be cleaned. It saves time and is economical. A patent has been applied for with the Ministry of Industry. Gentlemen who advocate domestic products, please do not miss this opportunity. The manufacturing plant is located in the west of Beihengyi Lane, Tianbao Road, Shanghai. The general distributor is Dashenhang, 190 Beijing Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Yang Yuxun Graduates from the University of Paris</h3>
<p>And Receives a Doctor of Letters Degree</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Yuxun, who graduated with honors in Arts from the National University of Paris and received a Doctor of Letters degree, is the nephew of Yang Wenjing, a prominent figure in Si County, Anhui Province, and the second son of Mr. Yang Qing. His family has been in the Hanlin Academy for generations, known for their literary talent. Mr. Yang is less than forty years old, but has a long history in the political arena. He studied in Germany in his youth, but returned to China without in-depth study. He then entered the Baoding Military Academy and the Army University, graduating from both. He first served under Li Chun, and then joined the Northeast, gaining the trust of Zhang Zuolin, and held important positions, becoming a backbone member of the new-style military officers in the Feng Army. After the tenth year of the Republic, Mr. Yang advocated promoting national unity and jointly planning national affairs. He suggested to Zhang Zuolin the establishment of the Sun-Duan-Zhang tripartite alliance. At that time, Mr. Yang was the plenipotentiary representative of the Northeast. He established a joint conference of provinces in Shanghai with Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, and others to jointly plan construction. After the thirteenth year of the Republic, Zhang Zuolin recommended Mr. Yang to assist the central government. Since then, Mr. Yang has shown great prominence, serving as the Deputy Minister and Minister of the Army, and also serving as the enforcement officer for the Jingji Garrison and the Jinpu and Huning railways, maintaining railway administration, and being loved by merchants and travelers. At that time, the Feng Army had strict discipline and a great reputation, due in no small part to Mr. Yang's efforts. After the Huanggutun Incident, Zhang Xueliang succeeded his father's career and appointed Mr. Yang as a representative to enter the pass because he was familiar with the situation in the South and had many old friendships with important figures in the Party-state. He went to Ping, Jin, Jing, Hu, and the two Guangdong provinces to negotiate for unification. Mr. Yang's long-cherished desire has finally been achieved. After Fengtian raised the banner of unification, Mr. Yang decided to go to Europe to continue his studies. He sold his private property in Tianjin to pay for his studies. In Europe, he specialized in social education. In addition to the fixed courses at the University of Paris, he also investigated primary and secondary school education in England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and other countries, paying particular attention to rural primary school education. According to overseas correspondence, Mr. Yang has graduated with honors from the University of Paris and received a Doctor of Letters degree. Mr. Yang is a formal military officer from the Army University, but he was able to thoroughly realize the importance of learning and bury himself in books at the National University of France. After years of hard work, he earned a degree. He can be said to be the first person to implement the cessation of military affairs and the pursuit of literary studies.</p>
<h3>Inducing Someone's Wife, Demanding Payment</h3>
<p>Chen Guisong Lost His Wife in Panic</p>
<p>Liu Zhengbang Took Advantage of the Situation to Demand Payment</p>
<p>Hu Weiren Spoke the Truth</p>
<p>Chen Guisong from Taixian lives in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, and works on a coal boat there. His wife, Mrs. Hu, named Xiaokouzi, is 24 years old. Although she comes from a humble family, she is quite beautiful, so many people covet her. On January 3 of this year, Mrs. Hu suddenly disappeared. Chen Guisong immediately sent out scouts to search for her. Liu Zhengbang, an idle loafer with no permanent occupation who loiters around Tanzhiwan, makes trouble and extorts money, so he is generally called a "gambler" and everyone fears him like a tiger. After Mrs. Hu disappeared, Liu Zhengbang volunteered to Chen, claiming that he would find Mrs. Hu, but Chen had to pay him thirty yuan. Chen Guisong is a poor scholar, so he has no such huge amount of money. He repeatedly pleaded with Liu to reduce the amount. Just as they were negotiating, Hu Weiren, a 17-year-old boy who lives with Chen Guisong, pointed out to Chen that before Mrs. Hu disappeared, he had seen Liu Zhengbang and Mrs. Hu in the bedroom together on a certain night, and it was not the first time. Chen Guisong realized that he had been working the night shift for a week and staying outside, and Liu took this opportunity to seduce his wife and commit adultery, so Mrs. Hu's disappearance was clearly Liu Zhengbang hiding her. He called the police, arrested Liu, and also sent the witness Hu Weiren to the Fourth District Police Station for questioning. It was found that the case was about inducing and harboring a married woman, so the case was transferred to the local court for trial yesterday.</p>
<h3>Two Wu Changnians</h3>
<p>I don't know if they are the ones who killed Xu Fangcai.</p>
<p>Shen Cai, a Jiangbei woman who runs a pancake shop at 332 East Broadway, is a middle-aged woman with lingering charm. Her husband is away on business and often not in the shop. Shen Cai is not used to sleeping alone. Last spring, she became acquainted with Xu Fangcai, a fellow villager, and they fell in love and were very close. There was a worker in the shop named Wu Changnian, who also flirted with Shen Cai from time to time, but there was no physical relationship. Later, due to an argument with Shen Cai, he was fired in May. Wu knew the details of Shen Cai's affair with Xu Lang. At midnight on July 9, Wu asked Xu for association money but Xu refused. Wu left resentfully. At 3:35 AM on the morning of the 10th, Xu was relaxing in the Xingqing Lane near Broadway, lying on the floor to cool off. Wu took the opportunity to stab him in the abdomen with a sharp knife. Xu woke up from his sleep in pain and chased Wu. After walking a few steps, he fell to the ground and cried for help. The patrolling Chinese police heard the alarm and arrived at the scene. They saw Xu struggling for his last breath with a murder weapon next to him. At that time, he was still able to speak and identified the murderer as Wu Changnian. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries at around 5:00 AM. The Huishan Police Station investigated Wu's pancake shop at 880 Hanbile Road and ordered detectives to arrest him secretly, but he had already fled. The day before yesterday, the Hongkou Police Station received a report from an informant and sent a detective, Zhang Desheng, to arrest a man named Wu Changnian from Jiangbei on Jiujiang Road. He is 37 years old. According to his confession, he has lived in Xinming Road, Zhabei, for more than 20 years. He knew nothing about Xu Fangcai's assassination. The police chief ordered him to be detained. The next morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the previous circumstances and requested that he be detained for further investigation. Wu Changnian firmly denied it. Judge Xiao Fen instructed that he be detained and the matter be investigated further.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Natural Science and Society</h3>
<p>Which science is more important and urgently needed?</p>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>The feelings of young people are naturally very sharp, and their emotions are extremely intense; however, the reality of everything is too bad and too unreasonable. Due to objective unreasonableness and their own lack of life experience, a general sense of negativity and boredom arises among young people.</p>
<p>Young people are the favored children of the era, and the future national construction and social improvement must rely on their efforts to succeed. Should we allow them to pass by so negatively now? Of course not. Your newspaper's "Reading Q&amp;A" provides a convenient forum for young people to explore knowledge, not only directly guiding young people toward a brighter future but also indirectly benefiting society and the nation. This is a very commendable undertaking!</p>
<p>Like the debate between materialism and idealism in the philosophical camp, what floats in my mind and urgently needs to be answered is: Among the two major categories of science, social science and natural science, which one is more needed in China, more urgently needed by society, and more beneficial to individual careers? Which one should I study?</p>
<p>Some say, "Study natural science, because from a spatial perspective, in present-day China, it is indispensable for resisting the economic and even political aggression of imperialism; it is indispensable for eliminating disasters and relieving famine; it is indispensable for enriching the country and strengthening the people. From a temporal perspective, it is indispensable for addressing the crisis of industrial backwardness; for fulfilling the material needs of the constitutional period; for stabilizing the modern rural economic panic and mass unemployment to stabilize the situation."</p>
<p>Some say, "Some people believe that China's ailment is economic poverty, and the prescription is, on the one hand, to improve the agricultural production methods in rural areas, and on the other hand, to revitalize urban industry and commerce. We ask, where will this huge amount of capital come from? Even if it is available after much hesitation, can it develop under the heavy pressure of imperialism, which holds China's customs, transportation, mining, banking, and other economic privileges at the same time, and which has excess capital and excess production? That is another question. Furthermore, given the frequent commercial wars and the chaotic situation of bandits everywhere, is there any possibility of development? That is another question. Taking a step back, even if imperialism and feudal remnants are overthrown, can agriculture, industry, and commerce thrive without relying on new-style machinery? Can you casually talk about revitalization and improvement without understanding the organization of the rural economy and the organization of international political economy? Then social science is indispensable!"</p>
<p>The above describes their advantages. As for the disadvantages, social science has: "China is an industrially backward country. No matter how much social science studies and improves politics, it cannot become rich and strong because China is a country of widespread poverty. Furthermore, China already has the Three Principles of the People, so it no longer needs imported ideologies researched by social science that are not suitable for China's national conditions. Moreover, changing a system is not easy and is incompatible with the national economy. It will not only fail to bring happiness to the people but will also add fuel to the fire and increase suffering." Natural science has: "Scientists (referring to natural scientists) invent machines, automobiles,... everything, only to allow them to further deepen the oppression of the toiling masses, or to enjoy happiness. The more developed science is, the more the majority of the people suffer its trampling and oppression. Perhaps even if science bestows benefits on you or the majority of the people, it will all collapse once the foundation of society changes."</p>
<p>Both sides have their flaws and merits, but generally speaking, both are equally needed in our China. However, "life is limited," and one person's energy is finite, and one cannot take care of both. "Trying to do too many things at once will lead to nothing being accomplished," and "it is better to be proficient in one thing than to be superficially knowledgeable in ten." For the sake of time and for the sake of spirit, I have an illogical request: Which one is more needed?</p>
<p>I think this is probably not just my personal request; most young people have this request. Resolving this request may slightly alleviate the boredom of young people. Therefore, I am writing this letter very urgently and hastily, hoping that you will consider the environment of the times, weigh the importance, clarify the urgency, and give a clear answer (please do not be ambiguous). This will not only be my happiness but will also benefit most young people. I have written a lot of rambling words, so I will end here. (I hope to receive a letter)</p>

<h3>Work-Study Platform</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xingfo once said that there are three kinds of people in China: the first is the big-headed, the second is the big-handed, and the third is the big-bellied. To put it clearly: the first kind of people study but do not work; the second kind of people work but do not study; the third kind of people neither study nor work. Those who study but do not work are the intellectual class, who only use their brains and not their hands and feet, so they are called big-headed. Those who work but do not study refer to the working class, who only use their hands and feet and not their minds, so they are called big-handed. Those who neither study nor work refer to the leisure class, who use neither their brains nor their hands and feet.</p>
<p>In fact, not only are the Chinese like this, but also the general life of human beings today is only these three types. There is no need to talk about those who neither study nor work. As for those who study but do not work, since study is separated from work, it is no different from a two-legged cupboard. Even if your learning is better, it is useless. If a cartoonist were to depict it, it would become a monster with small hands and feet carrying a large head. As for those who work but do not study, since work is separated from study, they are like machines that are used by others and blindly move all year round. No matter how diligent you are, there is no hope of progress. If a cartoonist were to depict it, it would be exactly the opposite of the former, which is also quite interesting.</p>
<p>Obviously, after work and study are separated, workers only care about closing their minds to work, using their hands but not their brains, and exerting physical labor but not mental labor. Scholars only care about closing their eyes to imagine, using their brains but not their hands, and exerting mental labor but not physical labor. In this way, each goes its own way and each follows its own trend, and everything will never evolve. Therefore, the pathological phenomenon of the separation of work and study should not exist. Then, the integration of work and study is inevitable. The so-called integration of work and study means doing things from the perspective of study and learning from within the doing. In other words, it means finding living knowledge from work and at the same time applying the dead knowledge from books to work. In this way, the knowledge gained is dead knowledge produced by the combination of thought and action; the work done is also true work produced by the combination of thought and action. Therefore, "integration of work and study" is truly the only way out for modern education.</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Wearing Glasses</h3>
<p>— Drunken Bamboo</p>
<p>Glasses can provide people with a lot of help. In this strangely shaped society, they are indispensable for enabling you to clearly recognize the road and understand the ways of the world. But at the beginning of your selection, you must choose what you need; otherwise, it will be harmful.</p>
<p>If your eyesight is such that you see the near but not the far, and can only recognize things in front of you, then you need a pair of "nearsighted" glasses. The term "nearsighted" is ironic and contains plenty of humor. It is named "nearsighted" but is actually not "nearsighted." It can allow you to clearly see and understand distant situations without making any mistakes. But you must know when to stop and not seek distance excessively. Seeing too far may make you see people as very "small."</p>
<p>Or perhaps you are not seeking a broad perspective, but only need to understand nearby things and deeply recognize them; then "farsighted" glasses can satisfy your desires. They magnify and clarify objects, allowing you to dissect and expose even the most subtle and intricate details. This allows you to observe the gaps in situations. But it shouldn't be too large either, as making it too large flattens people (or things). This loses the true form and is useless and harmful.</p>
<p>Among glasses, the best are plain lenses. They are clear and transparent, and do not alter the truth of situations in any way. Therefore, people with true vision like this fair "plain light."</p>
<p>The worst are colored glasses, which make red appear green, and reverse black and white, causing even good eyesight to become dazzling and uncertain. They will turn a clear and bright world into a "dark world." They will turn a "bright future" into "groping in the dark." The more you claim to have "piercing eyes," the more you will be manipulated by them. But there are also some benefits; they can prevent those blinded by greed from rushing forward blindly. They can evade the sharp eyes of others and hide one's true face. They can increase the timid courage of thieves, making them think that no one can perceive their intentions. So some people welcome them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are many, many people wearing glasses. Logically, there should be many "true visions, good visions, broad visions, and meticulous visions" that nakedly reveal the true forms of all aspects before our eyes; but why is this not the case? Why can't our visions be consistent? Why do people see different things? Perhaps they are all wearing the wrong glasses? Or are they wearing colored glasses? Strange!</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Xu Haojun</p>
<p>Leaving the hospital gate, in the sky, sparsely, a few crows "without branches to rely on" circled; on the road, frivolous young men jesting and flirting, closely followed clusters of female workers pouring out of the yarn factories. In that dim twilight, these female workers, as if freed from their cages, laughed freely, leaping and walking, hurrying back to their homes.</p>
<p>Who says I have no home? I have long had a home, and I have even cursed it. But every day, when I dragged my heavy legs, climbed the dilapidated stairs, and stepped into the damp room, a steaming dinner was laid out on the table, and soft, fluffy bedding was spread on the bed. Home was always prepared like this, waiting for its master's arrival.</p>
<p>Times have changed, and I haven't been home for a long time! "Heavy doors are deeply locked," "embroidered curtains hang low;" the air inside is very turbid because the windows have not been opened; even those few books, hiding in a glass cabinet covered with a layer of gray film, have not been touched for a long time, and seem like lovers who have lost their love, frowning all day, secretly complaining that I "started and abandoned!"</p>
<p>Such a home, with "the phoenix gone and the tower empty," where is my place of rest? Undoubtedly, I must leave home.</p>
<p>However, "home, sweet home!" The universe is so dark, and society is so cold; young people who are constantly running into walls, who doesn't yearn for you, who doesn't say they want you? Because only you are their sympathizer; only you open your kind embrace, caress their wounded hearts, and give them comfort, ease, and inner joy!</p>
<p>Leave your home? Bright lights and green wine, extravagance and dissipation, are filled with hypocrisy, depravity, charming smiles, and the temptation of money; although that is where young masters and high officials indulge and revel, but that, I dare say, is definitely not the home that pure and promising young people should want.</p>
<h3>Introducing Two Folk Songs</h3>
<p>— Tongchu</p>
<p>The large family system left over from patriarchal society, although there are still people singing its praises, but at least a part of it has been cursed by the general public.</p>
<p>In a large family, isn't there the so-called "patriarch" who wields great power? The people and things of that family seem to all belong to him. He sits on a high chair, directing: do this, do that, and others do as he says. This is the situation in the vertical aspect of a large family; as for the horizontal aspect, there is mutual infighting, jealousy, dependence, shirking responsibility, and quarrels. After the "patriarch" knows, he naturally has to fulfill his duties, so he smokes cheap cigarettes while turning over thoughts: "Each party has considerable reasons, what to do? Better to take a soft approach... call it even!" Who is the soft target? Naturally, it's the woman. So women in this large family have to endure even more unwarranted suffering. Now I want to introduce two popular folk songs from my hometown, look: how they are singing the arrival of their ideals, while also faintly cursing.</p>
<p>Don't say women have no work, going out every day to pick tea leaves, picking coarse or fine, letting people mock, faces flushed with a smile, how can tea leaves determine marriage, only because tea trees avoid transplanting roots, the girl hasn't received the tea yet, will a man come to discuss tying the knot.</p>
<p>Living alone, cooking alone, the couple are happy together, no sisters-in-law to quarrel, no parents-in-law to suppress me, others envy me for unmatched fortune, I say women's fortune depends on their husband, I only hope the husband doesn't smoke, doesn't gamble, and brings home more money.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Battalion Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Two: Murmuring Under the Lamp, Heartfelt Advice to a Weak Child / Strolling Down the Mountain, Coldly Watching Heroes</p>
<p>When he looked up, there was a platform next to this Tianqiao Bridge, with a short railing outside, and a person who looked like a guard was standing by the railing, sweeping downwards with his hand. Ji hurriedly jumped up and said; There's someone under this building. The guard stuck his head out and looked down, giggled, didn't say anything, and walked away. Mr. Zhao then stood up, brushed the melon seed shells off his body, and said to Ji in a low voice: It's okay, I didn't get my clothes dirty, forget it, we don't need to bother with this kind of person. Ji said: It's really outrageous, it would have been fine if you didn't apologize to us, but he was happy to see it and had to smile at us. As he spoke of smiling, there were even three or four voices rising from the platform, laughing heartily. Ji thought it was a reaction brought about by his own words, and was very angry in his heart. He immediately walked away for a dozen steps, then turned back to look at the platform. It turned out that there was a table and five chairs set up on it. Two young military officers and three gaudily dressed young women were sitting there. These three young women were arranged on the left and right, sitting in the middle of the military officers. Among these military officers, one had the fairest face and looked no more than thirty years old. One hand was on the back of the chair the young woman was sitting on, as if he was about to embrace her from afar. One hand held a beer glass high, level with the tip of his nose. Another military officer, with a small mustache, held the two hands of the young woman beside him with both hands, and leaned his head to speak into the young woman's ear. The young woman only tried to hide her face. She laughed so much that her body twisted like a copper wire, constantly writhing, so everyone on the platform laughed. Ji looked at this, nodded to Mr. Zhao, and beckoned him to come over. Mr. Zhao didn't understand what he meant, so he came over. Ji pulled his sleeve, poked his mouth towards the platform, and said in a low voice: Look, these are our Chinese military officers. Now the situation in Rehe is becoming more and more tense, and they still have the mood to bring women here to drink and watch the red leaves. (291)</p>

<h3>Key Cases Decided by the Ministry of Education's Mass Education Committee</h3>
<p>▲ Discussing and deciding on the ways to implement mass education.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Mass Education Committee has held meetings and decided on various cases, which have been reported in this newspaper. Therefore, people across the country want to know the details of the content of each resolution. Our reporter specifically visited the Ministry to find out the details as follows:</p>
<p>A. Discussing and deciding on the ways to implement mass education. This implementation pathway was drafted by Chen Lifu, Chen Jian, and Meng Xiancheng. In other words, it is a case formed by combining the opinions of the three and then revised and passed by the general assembly. Therefore, the entire assembly unanimously and attentively regarded this case as extremely important. It is heard that after this case is passed, all future mass education efforts will take this as a principle, and the methods mentioned in it, such as "learning by doing" and "knowing by doing," although many people who have been engaged in mass education before have also implemented them in this way, but after this joint regulation, there will be more basis for it in the future. The full text of the original case is as follows:</p>
<p>Mass education is to supplement the deficiencies of school education in order to achieve the goal of social construction. The first priority of construction is people's livelihood. The content of people's livelihood includes four things: first, people's lives; second, the survival of society; third, the people's livelihood; and fourth, the lives of the masses. Therefore, the purpose of mass education is obviously to enrich people's lives, support the survival of society, develop the people's livelihood, and continue the lives of the masses. In other words, the focus of mass education is on people's livelihood, and it is appropriate to start from people's livelihood in order to achieve the progress of people's rights and national rights. Now, if we want to improve people's lives and the people's livelihood, we must rely on the enrichment of vitality. If we want to ensure the survival of society, we must rely on the cultivation of organizational power. If we want to enhance the lives of the masses, we must rely on the promotion of national self-confidence. Therefore, the cultivation of vitality, organizational power, and self-confidence is what those engaged in mass education should strive for at present. In order to advance mass education, we must first enable the talents cultivated by school education to have the skills to achieve the above objectives and be able to become practical service providers and instructors for society. Then, the country will have one more educated person, that is, society will have one more mass educator. Otherwise, mass education does not belong to society, nor can it seek solutions to the problems of society itself. Therefore, if we want to solve the problem of mass education in the future, we should still take fundamentally improving the direction and methods of school education as a prerequisite. For temporary measures, we should formulate its goals and methods according to the objective conditions of society and the subjective conditions of social education as follows: 1. Goals: Starting from the urgent needs of the people's lives, actively enrich their vitality, thereby cultivate their organizational power, and promote the self-confidence of the entire nation, in order to achieve the educational goals of national independence, the universality of civil rights, and the development of people's livelihood. 2. Methods: Various mass education institutions should provide practical living organization tools and technologies, and do their best to organize experimental areas and other experimental undertakings, and gradually promote them, so that the masses can learn by doing and know by doing while participating in organizing and using tools and technologies, thereby obtaining the knowledge and skills necessary for their lives.</p>
<p>B. Discussing and deciding on two important points regarding the implementation path as follows: 1. Deciding to use mass schools, mass education centers, and mass education experimental zones as institutions for implementing the new path. 2. Various mass education institutions should consider the strength of talent and funding, delineate teaching areas, and base the standards and procedures of teaching on the actual needs of the masses in the area. This resolution aims to make existing mass education institutions suitable for the new path. 1. Deciding to refer the cases for discussion. The Ministry referred nine cases for discussion, and they were generally revised and passed. They contained a wide range of content and were complicated. The Ministry will announce them soon, and readers will know the details at that time. However, what can be reported first is that the regulations for mass schools will be announced soon, and the provisional regulations for mass education centers will also be revised and announced soon. In addition, the personnel appointment and treatment regulations for social education personnel, which have been expected for a long time, were also decided to be established and handed over to the Ministry's competent department and the Counselor's Office for research and revision. Once the revision is completed, it can be announced.</p>

In addition to forwarding the document, this order is issued to the bureau chiefs to follow and forward to all public and private high schools under their jurisdiction to comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Tsinghua University Graduate School Dispute: University Affairs Meeting Admonishes Students</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Yinque Sends Letter to the President Explaining Reasons for Not Sending Zhu Yanfeng</p>
<p>▲ Graduate Student Association Sends Representatives to Petition the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Tsinghua University held a university affairs meeting on the evening of the 12th and resolved the dispute over the graduate school sending students abroad. The president will issue a notice to the students, explaining the truth of the matter and warning the students not to listen or act rashly. Professor Chen Yinque sent a letter to President Mei Yiqi, reporting on the process of not selecting graduate student Zhu Yanfeng. At the same time, the Graduate Student Association held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The details of each party's situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>President's Announcement</h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of graduate students from this university's graduate school to study abroad, Article 14 of the graduate school's charter states, "All graduates from the university's graduate school whose grades are all above average may be recommended by the department heads to the council for selection and dispatch to study abroad." The original intention of this article was to carefully select and cultivate outstanding talents. When the council of this university recently discussed the issue of this year's graduate students, it also agreed that this article refers to the ability of each department's graduates to pursue advanced studies, and that each department should first review and decide whether to recommend them or not, and does not mean that all those with average or higher grades must be recommended by the department heads to the council. Furthermore, the recommendation procedures for this year's graduates have all been discussed in detail by the professors of each department in separate meetings, and the opinions of the research supervisors have been expressed and jointly decided, and then the department heads have submitted letters of recommendation. Furthermore, regarding the recent recommendation of this year's graduates from the Department of History of this graduate school to study abroad, Shao was recommended in 1933, and recently, Professor Chen Yinque of the department sent a letter stating the process, and the facts are available and can be reviewed. It is now found that Zhu Yanfeng, a graduate of the Department of History in this year's class, has not been sent abroad for research and has made a statement. He has been repeatedly explained and earnestly persuaded, but he has not realized his mistakes. Instead, he has arbitrarily attacked the head of the Department of History and slandered the council of this university. Such erasure of facts and confusion of public opinion are a betrayal of the school's purpose of nurturing talents for many years and are deeply regrettable. If the student has any more excessive words or actions of this kind in the future, this school will have to take strict disciplinary action to maintain discipline. I am sincerely afraid that the students may not be fully aware of the cause and effect of this matter and may be misled. Therefore, I am issuing this detailed statement so that everyone can know it. This is the announcement. President Mei Yiqi.</p>
<h3>Admonish Students</h3>
<p>It has been found that the Graduate Student Association of this school submitted two letters to this office and the council on the 9th of this month, all arising from the issue of selecting graduate students to study abroad. Regardless of the content of the requests in the letters, the wording is mostly inappropriate. On the one hand, the truth of the matter is not clear, and there are arbitrary slanders. On the other hand, the requests are based on intimidation, and the matter is akin to coercion. These students are all university graduates with considerable experience in scholarship and governance, and their thinking should be more mature and their behavior more reasonable. The performance in the two letters is very wrong and deeply disappointing. Even the students themselves must feel deeply sorry when they reflect on themselves. For the time being, considering that the occurrence of this matter is due to Zhu Yanfeng's strong arguments and that some important facts have not been paid attention to by the students, it has led to a temporary rash event. The president of this school, in view of his first offense, will not pursue the matter further. As for the facts of the selection of graduate students from this year's graduate school to study abroad, a separate announcement has already been issued. The students should be more clear about the fairness of this selection of students to study abroad. The president of this school has high hopes for how they should be more careful in their actions and words in the future. This is the announcement. President Mei Yiqi.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>After the above announcement was issued, the Graduate Student Association convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon at 7:30 to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that (1) the school should be requested to remove Jiang Tingfu from his position. This case will be submitted to the Student Union. (2) A statement will be issued explaining the inside story. (3) The Ministry of Education will be telegraphed to request a thorough investigation of the examination results. Before the investigation is completed, the students who have been selected to study abroad will be temporarily suspended from going abroad. (4) A representative will be sent to Beijing to personally present everything to the Ministry of Education. (5) A clarification will be made regarding the points in the school's announcement. The meeting adjourned at 10:30.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Groups to Hold Spring Joint Gathering</h3>
<p>▲ Meeting to be Held at 7 pm on the 19th at the International Recreation Club</p>
<p>The Sino-British Cultural Association and the Nanjing Returned Students Association have been working hard to introduce and communicate the cultures of the two countries, such as inviting famous British scientists to teach at universities in China and guiding students sent to study in the UK with Boxer Indemnity funds. They are currently actively planning to carry out these efforts. In the UK, academic and cultural groups have also come to China to express their willingness to cooperate in order to enhance the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and international relations. However, activities to connect with the feelings of members have not yet been held. As the new spring season approaches, it has been scheduled to hold a spring joint gathering at 7 pm on the 19th of this month at the International Recreation Club in Sanpailou, the capital city. In addition to a dinner, there will be entertainment. It is heard that Liang Yunli, Chen Xuenan, and Yu Mu have been invited to perform Han opera, Mrs. Wu Quan to perform Qin opera, a professor from Central University to perform Western music, and other interesting programs. All members of the two associations and their wives have been invited to participate, and the expenses will be paid by the associations. Many Chinese and foreign guests have been invited to make it a grand event. The organizers of the two associations, Zheng Tianxi, Zhang Daofan, Liu Haiping, Bulongde, Hang Liwu, Chen Jian, and He Meng, have been preparing everything these days.</p>

<h3>Daring Strange News: Jinnan Suffers Defeat Against the Navy in the Last Five Minutes; Navy Scores Consecutive Goals, Leading to a Tragic 2-3 Loss for Jinnan | A Scene from the Western League A Division Football Match |</h3>
<p>The Jinnan football team, after a devastating defeat to the Western Police last week, met the British Navy yesterday at Shen Park for an A Division match. They initially believed victory was assured, but unexpectedly lost 2-3. From now on, Jinnan's future and hopes seem diminished. Few spectators braved the cold, overcast weather to witness Jinnan's defeat. The Navy's players were all ordinary, their movements clumsy, their running slow, and their shots required deliberate footing. They relied solely on their tall stature to overwhelm Jinnan. The absence of Xu Heng from Jinnan undoubtedly had an impact, and Zhou Honglun's replacement of Wang Nanzhen was far less effective than Wang. The forwards' efficiency was even lower, and their performance was lackluster. The field conditions were poor, the soil frozen with ice, and the rain caused the ball to not bounce, disrupting normal play. Thus, Jinnan was defeated. Each side scored a penalty, resulting in a 1-1 draw at halftime. It was a coincidence that both Jinnan and the Navy were each awarded a penalty kick. After the start of the match, Jinnan immediately took the offensive, but several shots were ineffective. After a fierce offensive lasting twenty minutes, Jinnan again led an assault, reaching the Navy's goal. Defender Nicol, in a rush to defend, committed an illegal collision, resulting in a penalty. Luo Haiguang scored, repaying the favor. Unexpectedly, ten minutes later, Chen Zhenxiang also committed a foul in front of the goal, and the Navy also scored a penalty through Byrne-Lynch. Thus, the first half ended in a 1-1 draw, evenly matched.</p>
<p>Cai Lingcai Scores a Goal</p>
<p>The second half began, and Jinnan continued to press the attack, but their hearts and strength were misaligned. Repeated attacks proved fruitless, and numerous offside calls thwarted their advances. Ten minutes later, Luo Haiguang made a solo run, attacking the goal alone. With no one to stop him, he had a great opportunity to score, but Luo astonishingly shot the ball high into the sky, missing the goal, which was a great pity. As the second half passed the thirty-minute mark, Cai Lingcai dribbled in and scored with a single shot. Phillips was unable to save it, giving Jinnan a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>The Last Five Minutes</p>
<p>With only five minutes left until the end of the match, everyone believed that Jinnan could maintain its lead. However, misfortunes never come singly. In these final five minutes, the Navy suddenly scored twice in quick succession, turning victory into defeat. The Navy's relentless attack saw Robinson penetrate from the right wing, reaching the baseline and passing back to the center. Tugwell tried to get the ball but failed, and O'Connor gently kicked it into the goal, resulting in a tie. Unexpectedly, one minute later, they repeated the same maneuver, scoring again. Jinnan suffered a tragic defeat as a result, with a final score of 2-3. The Navy avoided a shutout and earned two points.</p>

<p>Western Youth Basketball Situation</p>
<p>▲A Division Championship a Must-Win for Max and Pirate Teams</p>
<p>▲B Division One: Fei Xia vs. Wan Xing Finals Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>▲B Division Two Belongs to Xin Yang, B Division Three to Ming Qiang</p>
<p>| Three Matches Tonight |</p>
<p>The Western Youth Basketball Association has been underway for a long time, and only a few matches remain. It is expected to conclude next week. The champions of each division can generally be predicted. The schedule for today's three matches is as follows:</p>
<p>Western Youth vs. Xin Yang Afternoon 7:00 PM B Division Two</p>
<p>Friendship vs. John Afternoon 8:00 PM A Division</p>
<p>West Team vs. Jinnan Afternoon 9:00 PM A Division</p>
<p>Currently, there are still over ten matches remaining in A Division. Half of these can be completed this week. The Max and Pirate teams have the strongest lineups and win every game. The champion and runner-up will undoubtedly come from these two teams. The highly anticipated Shanghai University team has had a significant drop in performance due to the absence of two or three key players. The status of Jiangwan Bo is still good. In B Division One, Fei Xia has five wins out of five matches, and Wan Xing has four wins out of four matches. Both teams have excellent players and skills. Who will win depends on the outcome of their match tomorrow night at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>In B Division Two, Xin Yang can comfortably sit in first place. Their only strong opponent, John High School, has already been defeated by Xin Yang. In B Division Three, Ming Qiang is undoubtedly in first place. It remains to be seen who will emerge victorious in the final B Division Three showdown.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education's Committee for Compiling Outlines for Physical Education Professors in Primary and Secondary Schools to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Committee for Compiling Outlines for Physical Education Professors in Primary and Secondary Schools is scheduled to meet at the Ministry of Education today (the 15th) starting at 9:00 AM. The committee members include Wu Yunrui (Editor-in-Chief), Wu Cheng, Cheng Dengke, Song Junfu, Chen Kui Sheng, Ling Chen Yingmei, Zhang Huilan, and others. In addition to the Ministry of Education's Physical Education Inspector Hao Gengsheng, the Deputy Minister of Education will also attend the meeting (Minister Wang may not be able to attend due to a meeting at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 15th). It is reported that the meeting will discuss preliminary issues related to the compilation, including: (1) The physical education curriculum standards for each level of school, although recently promulgated, were established four years ago. In the past four years, the international situation and domestic political and economic conditions have changed significantly. Is it appropriate to compile the teaching outline based on the standards set several years ago? This needs to be decided by public vote. (2) What types of teaching materials should be selected for each grade and how should they be distributed? This also needs to be decided. (3) Should the teaching materials be divided by week, day, or semester? This should be decided by public vote. (4) Physical education equipment is directly related to the implementation of teaching. Given the current financial difficulties, to what extent should the hypothetical installation of physical education equipment be considered? This needs to be decided by public vote. In addition, the meeting will discuss the compilation methods for junior high school physical education textbooks, including: (1) Unit of teaching materials, (2) Modified teaching materials, (3) Allocation of various activities within three years, (A) Game activities (1. Ball games, 2. Games), (B) Natural activities (1. Track and field, 2. Swimming), (C) Self-defense activities (1. Chinese wrestling, 2. Grappling), (D) Self-testing activities (1. Mat exercises, 2. Apparatus exercises, 3. Skill exercises), (E) Rhythmic activities, (F) Outdoor activities, (G) Corrective exercises, (H) Allocation of various activities, (I) Class hours allocated to various activities in each school year). It is expected that the compilation of the junior high school part will be completed during this winter vacation, and the high school and elementary school parts will be completed during the summer vacation. This meeting is expected to last about two days.</p>

<p>Special Correspondence: Report on Vocational Education by Ministry of Education Specialist on Inspection Tour of Europe (8)</p>
<p>a) Fine Arts and Metalwork Department: Practical work is divided into several branches, with each branch allocated a certain amount of time. For each item made, a complete drawing must first be created, and then each part of the item is made according to the drawing. For example, iron gates and railings with patterns are made according to this procedure. Even small items such as knives and forks must first have a drawing, and then the item is made, with the dimensions and sizes detailed on the drawing. (b) Shoemaking Department: This department is a training class for craftsmen. In addition to ordinary shoemaking work, it also studies special irregular foot shapes to determine which style of shoe is suitable. (c) Textile Pattern Department: The first step is to design the pattern, then match the raw materials and colors, and then weave the finished product, all done by the students themselves. (d) Fine Arts Writing Department: Studies the coloring of interior walls and patterns, and the coordination of appliance colors. (e) Materials Department: This department is where students practice masonry and plaster statues. Students from all departments must go through this department's work, which is regarded as basic training in art. (f) Decorative School (die Dekorationsfacbule): This school is jointly run by the municipal government, trade union, industrial association, commercial association, and various industry associations. In terms of organization, administration, and academic affairs, it is affiliated with the handicraft school. In terms of administration, there is a board of directors, composed of one representative each from the municipal government, industrial association, commercial association, various industry associations, and trade union, and the principal of the handicraft school. The representative of the municipal government serves as the chairman of the board. The purpose of this school is to train personnel for shop window and residential interior decoration. Therefore, the academic subjects are divided into two departments: 1. Shop Decoration Department, 2. Interior Decoration Department. The courses taught include handicraft, advertising, and fine arts, and can also serve as art supplementary classes for those serving in this profession. 1. Shop Decoration Department: The course length was initially divided into two semesters, but it was considered insufficient. With the consent of the German Shop Window Decoration Industry Association, it was increased to three semesters. The daytime courses are 44 hours per week. Students who already have a foundation can have their class time appropriately reduced. Upon graduation, an examination must be held, and a representative of the German Shop Window Decoration Industry Association participates in the examination committee. In addition to daytime classes, the school also offers evening classes and half-year classes. Research on the display of shop cosmetics, clothing, and other items is done by students themselves, and they must plan how to make the display eye-catching and attractive, and change it at any time to seek beauty. The teachers only provide guidance. 2. Interior Decoration Department: The design, matching of materials, style, and drawing of interior woodwork, etc., include general drawings and sectional drawings, with detailed dimensions and sizes. This department also teaches house planning and pattern making. Graduates can become architects. The wood used for making utensils is softened by steam and then tightly pressed with a pressing machine.</p>
<p>Koln Occupational School</p>
<p>Occupational schools are mostly funded by local groups or private factories. If it is a local public school, the state government subsidizes 25% of the funding. The teachers of private schools are recommended by public groups or factories and appointed by the director of education. For local government public schools, the state government can appoint a quarter of the teachers.</p>
<p>(1) Municipal Boys' Half-Day Supplementary School This school's academic subjects are divided into two categories: The first category is supplementary classes, set up for students to supplement their studies, with classes from eight to ten hours per week. However, students must be elementary school graduates to enroll. The second category is divided into two parts: (a) Students in the sixth grade of middle school without practical experience, (b) Students in the sixth grade of middle school with practical experience.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, there are workshops for electrical engineering, machinery, metalwork, and forging. Each practical session is three and a half hours, focusing on the accuracy of the craft to supplement the deficiencies of apprenticeship training. When visiting, the theoretical lesson was physics optics, testing refraction, using a glass tank filled with water and flat, shining a light beam into the water. The light refracts at an angle when it enters the water from the air, which is clearly visible. The students are deeply impressed by this phenomenon, which is far more effective than drawing and analyzing on the blackboard, which is empty and unfounded. This further demonstrates the importance of equipment in school science courses. The practical situation in each department is as follows: () Automobile Repair Department: The control components of each part of the automobile, such as lights, signals, carburetors, engines, and speed changers, are arranged on the test bench to familiarize students with them and teach them about the problems that occur in each part and how to repair them. () Plumbers Practical: Practical activities of bricklaying and roofing, such as preparing for the craftsman's examination. () Barber Shop: Practical for three and a half years before graduation. All unemployed workers can get a haircut here without charge, as a resource for students to practice. On this day, an examination was held, with the director of the barber industry association as the proctor. The time required for a haircut, its style, and the quality of the work must be the criteria for evaluating the exam results. () Clothing Department: Attention is paid to the quality of work on each part of the clothing, such as buttonholes and pockets, and how to make them strong and durable, which is highly valued during training.</p>
<p>(2) Secondary Architectural School This school is a full-day vocational school. Enrolled students must be at least 16 years old and have at least one year of practical experience (such as having served as a plumber, etc.) before they can participate in the entrance examination. The course is five semesters long. Graduates who pass the graduation examination can become craftsmen in the construction of houses, roads, ditches, and bridges.</p>
<p>(3) State Vocational School The academic level of this school is higher, similar to the level of university engineering and higher industrial schools. It is currently divided into three departments: 1. Architectural Engineering, 2. Electrical Engineering, 3. Machine Manufacturing, and also has evening supplementary classes and vocational teacher training classes.</p>
<p>The equipment includes the following departments: 1. Materials Testing Machine Room, 2. Electrical Engineering Laboratory, 3. Electric Welding and Gas Welding Machines, 4. Metalworking Gear Bed, 5. Gas Pipe and Water Pipe Installation, 6. Photometry Testing Room, 7. Display Room of Mechanical Models, such as gear matching pistons, etc., with many styles, 8. Radio Department, in addition to sound-emitting and receiving machines and vacuum tubes, there are also wave detectors.</p>
<p>The school is a half-day school, run by a dye factory and managed by the local government education bureau. The practical lessons are four years, and all the specialized factory workshops are rotated for learning. The theoretical lessons are three years, only eight hours per week, and there are two hours of physical education lessons. The teaching materials are detailed, and the lessons for each month, day, and hour must be determined in advance, and the teaching is based on this.</p>
<p>Frankfurt-Main</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural Education The agricultural schools in this area are divided into three levels: The first level is supplementary school, a village supplementary school, b special class. The second level is agricultural vocational school, a agricultural school (graduating in two semesters), b agricultural middle school (divided into six grades from 10 to 16 years old), c agronomy institute (Seminar for farmers). The third level is agricultural higher school. Students entering the agricultural college must have studied in middle school to the sixth grade or be graduates of agricultural school. In addition, there is also an agricultural women's class, specializing in home economics, needlework, fruit storage, etc., but must have three years of supplementary school before entering the school.</p>
<p>(2) Employment Guidance Bureau The employment guidance is not very same in each state. The Frankfurt-Main Employment Guidance Bureau handles two aspects of guidance: (1) Education (2) Economy. Student personality is most important. After graduation, the teachers list the reports in detail according to the usual observation. The physical condition is reported by the school doctor's inspection. According to the school report, the guidance bureau goes to each school for detailed oral consultation, and answers questions for students. When students go to the bureau, they must be accompanied by their parents. When students are consulted at the bureau, they must fill in a volunteer book, detailing their future professional aspirations and ideals. The handwriting reveals part of the personality. Students from each school, whether from elementary, middle or vocational schools, are assigned to different people for guidance, and various tests are given, such as students' psychological talents and finger movements, etc. On the one hand, students' personality can be known, and on the other hand, students can understand the knowledge and skills that should be available in the profession. The test methods are filling in words, puzzles, matching materials, mechanical assembly, making things according to drawings, etc. During the test, the teacher observes the student's finger movements and the degree of mental agility. After the test, a certificate must be filled in, after sixteen different inspections, and then it is ended. The inspection certificate also states the level of physical fitness, etc. These are all pre-procedures, and the guidance for each person must also refer to the world situation and local economic conditions, that is, the needs of the labor market, and then a definite decision is made.</p>
<p>Vocational Education in Stuttgart Young men and women who leave school at the age of thirteen or fourteen must intermittently enter supplementary school. The subjects include the following: 1. Craftsmanship, 2. Industrial manufacturing, 3. Commerce, 4. Agriculture. The lessons learned are 1. Citizenship, 2 Mathematics, 3. Records, 4 Vocational lessons. For women's schools, there is one clothing and two home economics. For agricultural schools, rural work is also important. School expenses are shared equally by the state government and the municipal government</p>
<p>Nunchen</p>
<p>There are three types of craftsmen schools, one printing craftsman school, two textile craftsman school, three lacquer craftsman school, all are the nature of secondary schools, and textile craftsman school is a women's school, but this time only the printing craftsman school was visited.</p>
<p>Printing Craftsman School This school was established in 1927 as a joint venture between the City of Munchen and the German Printing Association, and is one of the model schools. The initial funding was jointly borne by the state government and the printing association. Machine factories also donated a lot of printing machinery. Students admitted must have studied in public schools for more than ten years and have more than two years of printing or typesetting experience. The course is three semesters, and it is now planned to expand to four semesters. The first and second semesters focus on typesetting, the third semester is on printing, and the fourth semester is on lithography and copying. The practical lessons, such as typesetting and printing, are 25 hours per week. In addition, it also teaches the knowledge that should be possessed by various items in the printing industry, such as papermaking, source of raw materials, machine construction, color platemaking, cost accounting, wages, mathematics, bookkeeping, accounting methods, and payment of bills, drafts, commercial law, industrial organization, statistics, publicity, book binding, calculation, etc.</p>
<p>Students must also learn machine typesetting and bookbinding machines for a total of four weeks. Visiting trips to paper mills, printing machine factories, and dye factories are explained in detail by experts from each factory. There are currently 60 students, 30 studying printing and 30 studying typesetting.</p>
<p>Vocational Education in Dre den</p>
<p>The city of Dre den, the capital of Saxon, is the most active in promoting supplementary education. School associations are organized throughout the state to promote vocational supplementary schools. There are already 380 associations, and there are already 845 supplementary schools, seven of which have more than 100 classes, which also shows their development. Each week's homework is between three hours and twelve hours, averaging seven hours.</p>
<p>There are about 300 vocational schools, mostly founded by trade unions, industrial and commercial associations, agricultural associations, group associations. Only 12 schools are completely state-run. The vocational classifications include commerce, agriculture, manufacturing, industry, architecture, textile, leather making, flour milling, watchmaking, locksmith, ironwork, shipping, horticulture, musical instruments, etc., all of which are closely related to economic life.</p>
<p>Three. French Vocational Education</p>
<p>France first established "Practical Schools" in 1892, which was the beginning of vocational education, only forty years ago. Therefore, among all levels of education, vocational education is the most immature. "Practical Schools" are subordinate to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and its regulations on the purpose of such schools are specially and solemnly stipulated as follows: "Practical Schools are fundamentally and importantly different from ordinary senior elementary schools, that is, practical schools must tend to vocational application subjects and provide students with substantial apprenticeship training."</p>
<p>Therefore, the nature of practical schools is the training institute for factory technicians and shop employees.</p>
<p>However, practical schools do not represent the entirety of French vocational education. The organization of French vocational education is becoming increasingly complete. In addition to "practical schools," there are national specialized technical schools, national arts and crafts institutes, and central industrial manufacturing schools. Those with specialized characteristics include higher commercial schools. Before the European War, these schools were all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but at the end of the European War, they were all transferred to the Ministry of Education, and a special department was established to manage them. In 1925, the National Assembly resolved to expand vocational education, and the apprenticeship tax was also passed in that year, so the foundation of vocational education was more stable and the organization was more detailed.</p>
<p>Purposes of French Vocational Education</p>
<p>In the minds of French educators, vocational education must have two conditions: first, it must provide technical training; second, it must supplement national education and understand the national vocation, that is, to simultaneously increase the production capacity of technicians and their personal value in society. In modern times, mechanical appliances, factory organization, and production and sales methods have been improving day by day, and the training of skilled craftsmen is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>The beginning of youth career is best to be early. The appropriate time should be after the completion of elementary school, no later than sixteen years old, so that they can enter the society to serve and make a living on the day of completing training. If it is delayed for too long, it will waste time, delay employment opportunities, and delay the precious time when young people's intelligence is at its peak and easy to learn.</p>
<p>Vocational education must respond to environmental changes and have special responsibilities. The training methods must be able to meet modern needs on the one hand, and at the same time pay more attention to the social economic situation and changes in production organization, so that school classes can keep pace with the times, without lagging behind and being separated from social realities. Therefore, school managers and industry and economic circles must seek long-term and close cooperation to solve various problems in vocational training.</p>
<p>In most vocational schools in France, there are organizations of relevant committees. Practical schools and handicraft schools have "improvement departments," national vocational schools and arts and crafts colleges have management committees, and specialized technical classes at all levels have local committees. These committees are very free in terms of curriculum organization and the exercise of management powers in schools. All suggestions for improvement, etc., will be adopted by senior management agencies if they are possible within the scope of economic conditions.</p>
<p>In most vocational schools in France, in addition to the basic (1) machine repair mechanic (2) carpenter and (3) ironworker departments, specialized departments are set up according to local special circumstances, such as the clothing department in Vienna and Elbocuf, the shoemaking department in Romans and Nimes, the glove-making department in Grenoble, the lace department in Le Luy, the weaving department in Roubaix and Jourcoinq, the building department in Jourcoing, the pipe department diamond department in St Claude are all famous, and the practical schools in various places also have training departments for rural technicians, so vocational schools have deeply penetrated into the economic organization of local urban areas, and can be revised in the teaching methods and curriculum development according to local needs to make the cooperation between schools and local economy achieve the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>If you want to understand local needs, you must investigate the social situation, so the school guidance committee must have the participation of representatives from the economic sector, and the student examination committee must also have employers, foremen, technicians, and clerks as judges. Celebrities from industry and commerce are invited to visit the school from time to time. All those who care about vocational schools, support them, and promote their success will do their best to attract them.</p>

<p>Pulse Diagnosis Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>People on the market who think they know something about medicine often say, "Western medicine doesn't pay attention to pulse diagnosis. Traditional Chinese medicine really relies on pulse diagnosis." This kind of mixed-up tone is actually recognized by most people. However, when asked how new medicine doesn't pay attention and how old medicine diagnoses, there is no thorough explanation. In fact, the pulse diagnosis of old medicine has always been used to hypnotize people with mystery. Judging from rational reasoning, cun kou pulse diagnosis is really a bit unreliable. Didn't Mr. Yu Yunxiu already write an article in the previous few issues to criticize it severely? During the January 28th Incident, I asked several Confucian doctors, saying, "There are many wounded soldiers in the wounded soldier hospital who have lost one hand. But they often have some minor colds. According to the usual argument that western surgeons are good at surgery and Chinese doctors are good at internal medicine, if you are invited to diagnose them, then three-sixths of cun, guan, and chi have been lost. Is it convenient or inconvenient for you to diagnose the disease? Is it clear or unclear whether the left liver and right lung are messed up?". This simple question did not get an answer. Ah, mystery is not omnipotent! As for new medicine pulse diagnosis, there is actually considerable research. However, most of it is used to determine the condition of the heart and blood vessels. It cannot be a misjudgment of all diseases. Occasionally, there are slow pulses in typhoid fever, bigeminal pulses, and special fast pulses and slow pulses in several types of poisoning phenomena, which can also be used as a major reference in the direct diagnosis of diseases. Now I will extract the pulse term of new medicine. Readers, you will understand that new medicine also studies pulse diagnosis.</p>
<p>(1) Pulse speed. There is Pulsus celer for fast pulse. There is Pulsus tardus for slow pulse</p>
<p>(2) Pulse size. There is Pulsus altus for large pulse. There is Pulsus parvus for fine pulse.</p>
<p>(3) Pulse hardness. There is Pulsus durum for hard pulse. There is Pulsus mollis for soft pulse</p>
<p>In addition, there are many pulse abnormalities and pulse characteristics. For example, alternating pulse is called Pulsus alternans. Anacrotic pulse is called Pulsus anocrotus. Bigeminal pulse is called Pulsus bigeminus. Bisferiens pulse is called Pulsus bisferians. Frequent pulse is called Pulsus frequens. Paradoxical pulse is</p>

<p>New Developments in American Banking: Deposit Insurance By Xu Yuhan</p>
<p>A Brief Review</p>
<p>The United States has always been known for its small banking system. Broadly, banks can be divided into two types: state banks and national banks. The former are banks registered and established according to state government legislation, including trust companies and savings banks; the latter are banks registered and established according to federal government laws. Both are privately operated. American law has historically prohibited banks from establishing branches, so several banks mean several independent entities. They usually do not communicate and are prepared to be dispersed in various locations. Once a financial emergency or a bank run occurs, banks are helpless. The frequency of banking crises and the large number of bank failures in the United States are largely due to this fragmented banking sector.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 improved the fragmented state of the banking sector to a great extent. However, partly because the restriction on establishing branches was not abolished, and partly because only national banks were required to join the Federal Reserve System, while other banks could choose to join or not, the drawbacks of the old banking system were not entirely eliminated. According to a survey in 1929, the number of member banks and non-member banks was roughly equal. These non-member banks, with weak capital and imprudent operations, and without the backing of the Federal Reserve, were most likely to cause public distrust and affect the overall financial situation. The banking crisis in the spring of 1933 gave the United States a severe lesson.</p>
<p>After this lesson, the American banking sector realized that the weakness of the national banking system lay in the large number of independent and unsound banks, while the banks with strong capital and stable operations were restricted from establishing branches and could not expand as much as possible through cooperation. At the same time, because there were too many small banks, depositors lacked confidence. Groundless rumors often led to major crises. To ensure the sound development of the banking industry in the future, it was necessary to abolish the restriction on establishing branches, facilitate bank mergers to concentrate capital, eliminate a group of banks with weak foundations through drastic measures to increase the safety of depositors, and then use gentle methods to make all banks either become member banks of the Federal Reserve or dissolve themselves. To achieve the former goal, Section 23 of the Banking Act of 1933 stipulated that national banks could not only establish branches in their hometowns and cities but also establish branches anywhere in the state, provided they obtained formal consent from the state government and complied with the state laws. To achieve the latter goal, the government strictly examined the internal conditions of banks during the bank holiday in the spring of 1933. All banks whose assets were insufficient to cover their liabilities were not allowed to reopen. To date, 2,500 banks are still not allowed to operate (Note 1). On the other hand, the government implemented the so-called deposit insurance.</p>
<p>The Content of the Deposit Insurance System</p>
<p>Abolishing the restriction on establishing branches has long been practiced in countries such as Britain and Canada, which implement large banking systems. Today, there are very few independent banks in Britain and Canada, while branches are spread throughout the country. In other countries such as France, Germany, and Japan, merger movements have also been very significant in recent years, so this is not new. We will set this aside. Only deposit insurance is truly a novel idea. Although other countries have very strong central banks to back commercial banks, they do not explicitly insure the safety of depositors. This system is worth discussing.</p>
<p>The deposit insurance system is stipulated in the Banking Act, which was approved and implemented by the President on June 16, 1933. Section 8 of the Act is an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, which stipulates that "a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation) shall be established, whose responsibilities include purchasing, holding, and liquidating the assets of failed national and state banks; and insuring the deposits of banks that meet the requirements of this section." The administration of the Corporation is the responsibility of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consists of three members, including the Comptroller of the Currency as an ex officio director, and the other two are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate, with a term of six years. The chairman is elected from among the appointed directors. Appointed directors receive a salary of $10,000 per year, paid monthly. The Comptroller of the Currency is an unpaid position.</p>
<p>The Corporation's capital is not fixed and varies with the amount of deposits. Each share costs $100. The U.S. Treasury purchases $150,000,000. The timing of the collection of the national shares, whether partial or full, is determined by the Board of Directors. The remaining shares are divided into two categories: A and B. Class A shares are purchased by member and non-member banks, and Class B shares are purchased by Federal Reserve Banks. Class A shares and national shares pay 6% interest per year, while Class B shares do not have the right to dividends. The total amount of Class A shares should be equal to 5/1000 of the total deposit liabilities of the purchasing banks—including time and demand deposits. It is currently estimated to be around $175,000,000. If the deposits of each bank increase or decrease in the future, the number of shares purchased should also increase or decrease proportionally. The amount of Class B shares should be equal to one-half of the Federal Reserve Banks' surplus on January 1, 1933, which is $139,300,000.</p>
<p>Before purchasing Class A shares, member banks must first fill out a subscription form. After receiving the request form, the Corporation will ask the Federal Reserve Board or the Comptroller of the Currency to review the bank's assets to determine whether they are sufficient to cover its liabilities, depending on whether the requesting bank is a national or state bank. If the Federal Reserve Board or the Comptroller of the Currency is satisfied, they will issue a certificate of approval, and the Corporation will recognize the requesting bank as a Class A shareholder. If they are not satisfied, they will issue a denial letter, and the Corporation will refuse its subscription accordingly. Non-member banks also go through the same procedures to become Class A shareholders. However, from July 1, 1936, non-member banks may not become Class A shareholders and enjoy various rights of the Corporation unless they change their status to member banks. Non-member banks that were Class A shareholders before July 1, 1936, but did not change their status to member banks after July, will have their shares refunded and their rights terminated.</p>
<p>If a state member bank cannot purchase shares of the Corporation and become a Class A shareholder due to restrictions in the laws of the state where it is located, it may request the Corporation to allow it to enjoy insurance benefits. If approved by the Corporation, it must deposit an amount equivalent to 5/1000 of the bank's total deposits with the Corporation, which will pay 6% interest per year and enjoy the benefits of a Class A shareholder. If the bank's deposit liabilities increase or decrease in the future, its deposits with the Corporation should also increase or decrease proportionally at a rate of 5/1000.</p>
<p>If a national member bank has not become a Class A shareholder before July 1, 1934, the Comptroller of the Currency may appoint a successor to take over the bank in accordance with the law, and the bank will not be allowed to reopen until it becomes a Class A shareholder. If it is a state member bank, its membership status will be terminated unless it can be accommodated by depositing funds due to the aforementioned state law relationship.</p>
<p>This law will be implemented from July 1, 1934. From that time, one-half of the Class A and Class B capital will be collected to establish a permanent fund, and the remaining one-half will be convened by the Board of Directors at any time. Depositors with deposits of $10,000 or less in Class A shareholder banks will be given 100% insurance. Those with deposits between $10,000 and $50,000 will be insured for 75%. Those with deposits over $50,000 will be insured for 50%. From July 1, 1934, to June 30 of the same year, is the trial insurance period. A temporary fund will be established, with each member bank contributing an amount equivalent to 5/1000 of each bank's total deposits, with one-half paid in advance and the remaining one-half collected when the fund is insufficient. With the consent of the Corporation, non-member banks will also become part of the temporary fund after paying the funds in accordance with the rules. Banks that are part of the temporary fund will have their depositors' deposits insured in full up to $2,500 during the trial period. Before July 1, 1934, the Corporation should estimate the remaining balance of the temporary fund after deducting all expenses and liabilities, and refund it to each bank in a fair manner. From then on, when a bank that is part of the temporary fund, a Class A shareholder bank, or a member bank that cannot be a Class A shareholder but has a special deposit with the Corporation—in other words, a bank that can enjoy the right to be insured—fails for various reasons, the Comptroller of the Currency will appoint the Corporation as the receiver of the failed bank. The Corporation should immediately plan a new bank to inherit all the deposit liabilities of the failed bank. With the consent of the Corporation, the new bank may accept new deposits and, after completing the legal procedures, may change its status to a national bank. It is estimated that depositors who are fully protected by this new banking law accounted for 96.5% of the total number of depositors in member banks before July 1, and 99.3% after July 1. This can be observed from the total number of deposits in member banks published by the Federal Reserve Board in 1933 below (Note 2).</p>

<p>A General Overview of Public Opinion</p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was established in September 1933. In addition to the Comptroller of the Currency, President Shan appointed W.J. Cummings and E.G. Bennett as the three directors, with Cummings as the chairman. In a radio address, Cummings stated that "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has now been organized and established. From now on, the Corporation will use all its assets to back every insured bank to protect the safety of depositors' deposits" (Note 3).</p>
<p>Since the Deposit Insurance Corporation has been organized and established, public opinion is divided. Opponents believe that the benefits to depositors are too generous. If each bank operates under free competition, each bank must be prudent to gain the trust of depositors. At the same time, when depositing funds, depositors must also choose a better bank. Under this system, whether a bank's business is developed is a reward for whether its business policy is good. With the deposit insurance system, depositors do not have to choose insured banks, which naturally increases the deposits of weaker banks. This is tantamount to encouraging poor banks. Furthermore, a well-managed and reputable bank bears the losses of its poorly-managed peers, which is inconsistent with the principle of fairness. In addition, banks that cannot enjoy insurance benefits for various reasons will not gain public trust and will inevitably fail in large numbers.</p>
<p>Those in favor believe that, with a few exceptions, depositors are often only attracted to higher interest rates and do not have the ability to judge the quality of banks. Since the government has actively intervened in banks since the spring of 1933, and only allows banks that it deems to have the ability to repay debts to reopen, the banks that have reopened are naturally those that the government deems to be good. To show that its judgment is sound, the government should guarantee the safety of depositors. As for saying that well-managed and reputable banks bear the losses of their poorly-managed peers, which is inconsistent with the principle of fairness, such unfairness exists everywhere in society, why should only the deposit insurance system be singled out? A law-abiding citizen pays police taxes to prevent criminals, which is a good example. Moreover, financial crises easily spread, and banks that are well-managed on weekdays are often implicated and closed down. With deposit insurance, their reputation will naturally be even more outstanding, and their business will naturally be even more developed, so the gains outweigh the losses. Moreover, because they have to share losses, peers will inevitably encourage each other and move towards sound development.</p>
<p>Supporters believe that the reasons put forward by the opposition, namely that many banks will fail after the implementation of the insurance system, are untenable. They believe that these failed banks are either weak in foundation and should be closed down, or they voluntarily give up their rights. Because before July 1, 1936, non-members could also be Class A shareholders and enjoy the right to be insured. Although after July 1, 1936, non-member banks could no longer be Class A shareholders and therefore lost all rights, why didn't they join as member banks? This is precisely the intention of the legislators to strengthen the connection between the American banking sector. Supporters admit that under the insurance system, banks with relatively poor credit or weaker management have more deposits than before the insurance system. However, this does not encourage poor banks. They pointed out that "what the Corporation guarantees is depositors, not banks." If there are base bankers who use insurance as a backing to engage in speculative businesses and other illegal operations with depositors' deposits, this is a misuse of the insurance system, which can be ordered to close down by the government. The problem lies not in the weakness of the insurance system itself, but in whether government supervision is effective.</p>
<p>The above is a bird's-eye view of the historical background, content, and public opinion of the deposit insurance system. At the beginning of the new system, what the future results will be, what the impact will be, and which side of the supporters and opponents has more adequate reasons, will not be speculated or judged here, but will be left to the most eloquent facts of the future.

<h3>Roosevelt's Silver Policy and China By Wei Qi</h3>
<p>On December 21st of last year, U.S. President Roosevelt approved the London Silver Agreement concluded by the largest silver-holding country and the largest silver-producing country at the World Economic Conference, and issued a proclamation allowing people to send newly mined silver to the mint to mint silver coins. The purpose of this was to increase and stabilize the price of silver, especially the domestic price of silver in the United States, to promote domestic and foreign trade, and to ease the domestic political situation, namely, "hoping to obtain the support of silver-faction congressmen for the government's monetary policy, to divide the power of the inflationary currency faction, and to avoid an inflationary currency war in Congress." However, because China is one of the world's largest silver-using countries, and is also a member of the London Silver Agreement, and because the Silver Agreement will be effective from January 1st of this year, it is not entirely useless to discuss this issue now.</p>
<p>To clarify this issue, it must first be understood that the reason for the decline in the price of silver. Although silver is slightly different from general commodities, it is not destroyed by consumption, but in fact, it is still one of the commodities. Therefore, the height of its price naturally cannot escape the law of supply and demand. Therefore, since the 1880s, on the one hand, due to the discovery of new silver mines and the advancement of technology, the output of silver has absolutely increased. On the other hand, because European and American countries have successively adopted the gold standard and abolished the free coinage of silver coins, the demand has decreased. Therefore, the price of silver has gradually fallen. As for the recent plunge in the price of silver, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons, special reasons such as the current world economic panic and the sale of stored silver by India and European countries should also be added.</p>
<p>To make the issue easier to understand, the following may briefly describe the supply and demand relationship of silver in recent years and the traces of the decline in the price of silver. (1) Supply of Silver</p>
<p>In addition to considering the newly produced silver, the supply of silver should also consider the return of stored silver to the market. Newly produced silver is, needless to say, silver produced from silver mines and various other metal mines. In the past, very little silver was produced in various metal mines, but because of recent advances in science, many silver can be produced as a by-product from copper mines, lead mines, and zinc mines by using electric steel separation methods. This method not only dramatically increased the output of silver (accounting for 80% of the total silver output), but also greatly reduced the cost of silver production. Therefore, this point is worth special attention. As for the return of stored silver to the market, it is due to the government's recoinage of light silver coins, the destruction of silver coins, and the sale of the resulting silver and silver reserves to the market. At the same time, the people also sell silver, which is used as a means of wealth storage, to the market based on certain needs.</p>
<p>The world output of silver has shown a sharp increase since the discovery of the New World in the fifteenth century. When rich silver mines in Mexico and South America were discovered one after another in the nineteenth century, its output showed a leaping increase. As a result, on the one hand, it promoted the decline in the price of silver, and on the other hand, it promoted the adoption of the gold standard by European and American countries. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, the excellent silver mines had been gradually exhausted, resulting in a gradual decrease in the annual output of silver, as was most evident around 1915. Until 1913, the annual output was still above 200 million ounces, but in 1914, it decreased to 168 million ounces. Since then, until 1921, it was below 200 million ounces every year. The reason why the output rebounded to above 200 million ounces after 1921 was not due to the discovery of new silver mines, but due to the advancement of science, which used electric steel separation methods to produce it as a by-product from various metal mines. The following table lists the world silver output since 1851 and the recent silver output of various countries for reference.</p>
<p>(1) World Silver Output (Unit: Ounces) Year 1921 171,200,000</p>
<p>1851 28,488,597 1922 209,800,000</p>
<p>1856 29,095,428 1923 246,000,000</p>

<p>1915 184,000,000 1932 160,200,000</p>
<p>From 1493 to 1932, a total of 440 years since the discovery of the New World of the Americas, the total world silver output was approximately 15.3 billion ounces. Among them, approximately 9 billion ounces were produced in the 408 years before 1900, and the remaining 6.3 billion ounces were produced in the 32 years from 1901 to 1932.</p>
<p>(2) Recent Silver Output of Various Countries (Unit: Kilograms) Country 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932</p>

<p>Total 8,039,000 8,225,000 7,704,000 5,000,000</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the world silver output was the highest in 1929, and then gradually declined, which is needless to say due to the impact of the world economic panic.</p>
<p>The country with the most output is Mexico, with 3,381,138 kilograms in 1929 and 2,155,500 kilograms in 1932. Mexico is followed by the United States, with 1,892,959 kilograms in 1929 and 757,000 kilograms in 1932. The third place is Canada, with 719,836 kilograms in 1929 and 553,900 kilograms in 1932.</p>
<p>The sale of stored silver was very small during the European War because the warring countries prohibited the export of gold and increased the amount of silver used for auxiliary currencies. However, in the course of the war, various countries have become accustomed to using small-denomination paper money and new auxiliary coins such as zinc. Therefore, taking advantage of the great surge in the London silver block market in 1920 at 89 pence, the European countries competed to destroy silver coins and sell the resulting silver to the London market. Not only silver coins were destroyed, but also silverware and stored silver blocks also appeared in the market. It is said that in 1920 alone, 14.6 million ounces of silver blocks were shipped from France to the London market, 3 million ounces were shipped from Belgium to the London market, and 4 million ounces were shipped from the Netherlands to the London market.</p>
<p>In 1921, Britain recoinaged silver coins, reducing the quality, and sold approximately 90 million ounces to the market. Since then, silver blocks have been sold every year, and even in 1929, 10 million ounces were sold. Other countries such as Germany, Poland, France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy also recoinaged silver coins to reduce the quality, and issued small-denomination paper money, selling the silver they held to the market.</p>
<p>In 1927, India reformed its monetary system, adopted the gold exchange standard, and prohibited the free coinage of silver coins. It destroyed and sold a huge amount of silver rupees to the market. It is said that approximately 250 million ounces were sold in ten years. In 1930, French Annam also adopted the gold exchange standard and sold the silver it held. The following table lists the amount of silver sold by various governments over the years: (Unit: Million Ounces) Year British Silver Coinage European Silver Coinage Abolition Indian Government Sales Total</p>
<p>1920｜｜18.0｜18.0</p>
<p>1921｜｜31.0｜31.0</p>
<p>1922 24.0 19.0｜43.0</p>
<p>1923 25.0 20.0｜45.0</p>
<p>1924 2.0 18.0｜20.0</p>
<p>1925 7.0｜｜7.0</p>
<p>1926 0.7｜｜0.7</p>

<p>1929 10.0 10.0 35.0 55.0</p>
<p>1930｜22.0 29.5 51.5</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the total sales amount in 1928 was 60 million ounces, and in 1929 it was 55 million ounces. The above-mentioned 1929 was also the year with the highest amount of newly produced silver. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to promote the subsequent decline in the price of silver.</p>

<p>Last Week's Bond Market Followed the Development of the Situation｜The Increase in Troop Reduction Reached Four Yuan｜</p>
<p>From January 8th to 13th last week, the market trend of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange showed a slight tremor and restlessness. The Min-Zhe war, after the capture of Yanping, showed a rapid reversal. The central army struck Fuzhou and could take it down at any moment. Suddenly, the southwestern army went to southern Fujian, although it was to block the Fujian communists, it inevitably had the suspicion of Xiang Zhuang's sword dance. Japanese expatriates firmly refused to retreat from the dangerous city, and the Japanese again had an excuse to protect the puppets. The central army inevitably suffered some resistance. The postponement of the Fourth Plenary Session was approaching. Whether it could resolve all disputes, coupled with the government's issuance of 100 million yuan in 23-year tariff bonds, although it was said that it would not be listed on the market for the time being, the economic power had already been affected by it. The bond market initially rose due to the central army's successive victories and the imminent resolution of the Fujian rebellion, but was unable to rise steadily due to this unexpected obstacle. After a week, it initially rose with the victory of the attack on Fujian, and then fell due to the emergence of large households. In the middle, on Thursday, the situation in Fujian showed a rapid reversal, and large households bought in enthusiastically. No. 75 and the northern gang greatly covered their short positions. The bond market saw many new high prices. The troop reduction bonds rose the most fiercely, breaking through 65 yuan. However, No. 46 took the opportunity to sell a large amount of salt tax, resulting in a difference of 16 to 17 yuan between the high and low prices of salt tax and troop reduction. The bond market was therefore temporarily tired and unable to rise on Friday and Saturday. As the weekend closing approached, a large number of purchases suddenly appeared for No. 20, and it began to turn firm and expensive. The future situation, because the 19th Route Army has retreated from Fuzhou, is feared to have a major reaction. As a result of the market price, it rose by one yuan to four yuan. Among them, the troop reduction rose the most, at four yuan. The total number of transactions was 152.19 million yuan. The results of the high, low, rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>University Faculty Association Responds to the City's Independent Education Funding Movement</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday's Reply to the City Education Association Expressed Approval</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Faculty Association, regarding the city's independent education funding movement, sent a letter yesterday to the City Education Association, stating:</p>
<p>"In response to your esteemed letter, we have learned that the only foundation for promoting education lies in sufficient and guaranteed funding. This is a consensus among education practitioners. Shanghai, as the cultural center of the country, has never had independent education funding, which is a major obstacle to the development of education. We approve of your esteemed association's proposal to ensure that the city's education funding should account for a quarter of the city's total revenue, earmarking certain reliable tax revenues to offset this, and establishing an education funding management office to handle this matter. Your insightful and strategic plan is worthy of admiration. From now on, existing education funds can be allocated, and the funds can be completely independent. The development of education in the city can be expected. Our colleagues unanimously agree with this. This is our formal reply. We wish you peace. The Shanghai University Faculty Association."</p>
<h3>International Society for Communicating International Culture Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Elected Cai Zhengya, Xu Peikun, and Others as Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>▲Soliciting Essays on How to Deal with World War II</p>
<p>The International Society was initiated and organized by over a hundred renowned scholars from home and abroad, including Chen Guyuan, Zhao Jingchen, Cai Zhengya, Wu Yugan, Zhou Gechang, Zhang Sumin, and Xu Peikun. It is dedicated to studying current international issues, communicating international culture, and discussing China's path in the Second World War. The society has been preparing for a long time and held its inaugural meeting in Shanghai yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Origin of the Initiative</h3>
<p>The origin of the society's initiative is as follows: "The organization of every free group has its historical motivation for social development. 'Independence and self-reliance' is a powerful expression of oppressed nations resisting oppressor nations. 'Catching up' is a clever strategy for countries to advance along the path of advanced countries. China's failures have often been due to the public's lack of understanding of the international situation. To remedy this deficiency, we must gather our strength, study, and analyze to simplify the complex international situation and make it accessible to the public. The idea of organizing the International Society lies in this. The world is shaking and unstable. Although we luckily survived the 'September 18th' and 'January 28th' incidents in terror, the terrible catastrophe will eventually come. In this future of turbulent changes, we should not cling to the old and tolerate and endure. We should 'change peace to resistance' and 'change patience to struggle', jump out of the circle of oppression and exploitation, and reach the bright and broad road. Let intellectuals and people of lofty ideals come!"</p>
<h3>Establishment Situation</h3>
<p>The society held its inaugural meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday at its headquarters at No. 67 Huanlong Road in the city. More than 120 initiators attended.

<h3>Dedication Ceremony of Shangwen Elementary School Building</h3>
<p>Shangwen Elementary School on Shangwen Road in this city held a dedication ceremony for its new school building and an exhibition of student achievements at 9:00 AM yesterday. Tong Xingbai, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Chen Kecheng, representative of the Municipal Government, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Section Chief Chen, Huang Zhaoxiong, representative of the Municipal Education Association, guests Tang Guanyu, Lin Kecong, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Yongchun, and other teachers and students from the entire school, totaling about 300 people, attended. First, Ms. Yang Jingyi, the principal of the school, reported on the construction of the school building. Then, Tong Xingbai, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Chen Kecheng, representative of the Municipal Government, Director Pan and Section Chief Chen of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Huang Zhaoxiong, representative of the Municipal Education Association, delivered training speeches one after another. Director Pan's training speech stated: "Today is the dedication ceremony of the new school building of Shangwen Elementary School. We hope that with the new school building, there will be new developments. Previously, all teachers and staff of the school devoted themselves to the construction of the new school building. In the future, they should strive for the reform of education. Nowadays, people generally believe that China used to emphasize literature over martial arts, which caused the people to be unable to become strong. Now it seems incorrect to emphasize literature again. In fact, the word 'literature' should not be interpreted as the literature of martial arts, but as the literature of culture and civilization. In the school, we should study academics to create a new culture and continuously improve the inherent civilization. We hope that elementary school students will establish their outlook on life and determine their goals in school, and there will surely be good results in the future." Finally, Principal Yang delivered a thank-you speech. The meeting did not end until 12:00 noon. From 1:00 PM in the afternoon, recreational activities began. The school building constructed this time is quite magnificent, with construction costs totaling more than 60,000 yuan.</p>
