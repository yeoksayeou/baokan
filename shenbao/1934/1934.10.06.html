<p>林陸相謂未脱非常時期</p>
<p>日報所載日德同盟内容</p>
<p>（東京）　林陸相五日上午五時由金澤回京、陸相談曰、陸軍因此次關西風災被重甚大、地方農村復興費達巨數、第二次國防充實問題須要愼重考慮、編成預算、陸軍發行關於國防問題之小册子、對於各方面起大影響、然現在國際情形未脱非常時期、國民全體應有充分覺悟、敎育思想及經濟問題與軍備有密接關係、係由國防見地研究之重要問題、軍部考慮經濟動員資金動員等國民動員之計劃、故擬於將來再發小册子、猛促國民覺悟云云、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>法國哈瓦斯通訊社前發表巴黎各報所傳日德同盟消息、惟其電文簡單、無由測知其内容、據大阪每日新聞巴黎特派員專電、巴黎各大報所載日德同盟密約内容全文如後、</p>
<p>日本對蘇俄外交失敗後、進行聯德計畫、由日要人德川公爵·前陸相荒木·及今夏訪問德國陸海軍當局之松下中將進行日德秘密同盟、迨至八月密約遂告成立、其内容要點如後、</p>
<p>（一）德國承認日本在貝凱湖以東西伯利亞一帶之特殊利益、</p>
<p>（二）日本承認德國在烏克蘭一帶之殖民地計畫、</p>
<p>（三）兩國約定政治上軍事上互相援助、</p>
<p>（四）該約期限爲五年、</p>
<p>德方根據該密約、擬於今後六個月内選派航空技術家五百人赴日、其中十名卽將渡日　德海軍及軍需化學廠亦派技術家赴日、恊助日方軍事技術云、（中聯社）</p>
<p>（東京）　本日閣議席上、由林陸相關於小册子問題加以解釋、但一部分閣員則謂、此次陸相在旅行中突然發表小册子、世上以爲因有任何特種事情方能出以此種行動、恐對於財界及其他關係上惹起惡劣影響、嗣後倘有此種發表之際、應請與政府充分取得聯絡、務乞加以留意、林陸相對於此種意見、亦表示諒解矣、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　林陸相在五日閣議席上辯明小册子問題、謂小册子中記載事項並非由軍部本身實行、於是本問題已無一段落、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>日本軍事計劃</p>
<p>所謂「國防國策之提倡」</p>
<p>（華聯社東京通訊）陸軍省於十月一日出版小册子十六萬部、題爲「國防之本義及其强化之提倡」、其中「國防國策之提倡」一段、係軍部素來之提倡、茲錄其要綱如下、足以窺軍部之政策、</p>
<p>國防之組織　將來國際間之抗爭、可謂係智能與智能、組織與組織之比賽、故又可謂、勝利之錦標、當落於具有比對手優秀之計劃者及組織者之掌上、於是、國防國策者、可簡單定義如下、以國防的目的、對國家所有之國防要素加以組織及運用之政策、</p>
<p>國防與國内問題　（一）國民生活之安定、如祗有國民之一部份享受經濟上之利益、尤其是不勞而得、而國民之大部份淪於水火之中、因而發生階级之對立、如有此事實、由一般國策或由國防政策觀之、此乃不可一暼而去之問題、故希望全體國民、抛棄利己的個人主義經濟觀念、大悟而採取全體的經濟觀念、又爲實現皇國之理想、向樹立適當之經濟機搆一路邁進、苟有心靈之人、勿論學者或實業家、又不問在朝在野、須舉國一致考究其對策、企圖其實現、關於國民生活、目前之最大問題、爲匡救農山漁村、（二）農漁村之更生、農產物價之不公平及不安定、生產品配給制度之不完備、農業經營法之缺陷與過剩勞働力利用之不適當、佃農問題、公税公捐等農村負担之過重與負債之增加、肥料之不廉、農村經融之不圓滑、繭絲價之暴跌、旱水風雪蟲等自然災害、農村之果農思想及缺乏中堅人物、有限定之耕地及人口之過剩、上記之諸原因互相交錯而惹起現在之農村之疲敝、然此等原因之半數以上、可歸納於都市與農村之對立、而爲救濟窮窘之農村、固極需要社會政策的對策、然更爲緊要者、須以農村與都市之相依存及國民共存共榮之全體觀念爲根幹、改善經濟機搆、解决人口問題等講究根本對策、而希望農村自身之自律的勤勞精神及剥造力之强化發展、而由根底恢復元氣、（三）總意發明之組織、統制科與機關、使其合理化·能率化·節省化·以便利用、爲奬勵發明供給資金、利用研究機關、改善特許制度等諸設施、爲需要、</p>
<p>國防與思想　思想是人的要素、卽精神力及體力之充實、故須由與校及社會敎育機關加以陶冶、同時須矯正社會之缺陷、整調經濟組織、以安定國民生活、救濟農村使其蘇生、而培養民力、</p>
<p>（一）國民敎化之振興、使國民對肇國之理想及皇國之使命、抱有深切之認識及鞏固之信念、而使其對皇國内外瀰漫之不正而過激之任何思想、絲毫不爲之動摇、須確立如此堅决之國家觀念及道德觀念、涵養爲國家及全體犧牲自己之崇高之思想、艾除無視國家、忌避國家所需統制之個人主義及違背國家利益之極端之國際主義及利己主義、養成朴實剛毅之氣風、一掃頽廬空氣、使國民通曉世界之現狀及國際情勢、認日本在世界上之地位、顯揚民族特有之文化、防止泰西文物之無批評之吸收、改變智育偏重之敎育制度、重視訓育、且須注重實務的實際的敎育、又須謀體育之進步、</p>
<p>國防與武力　現在我國陸軍保有之軍備是足以維持國防之消極的最小限度之軍備、在大戰止後、俄國之軍備薄弱之時代、尙足以維持東亞和平之靜和目的、但今因滿洲事變、國防之第一線擴大、須維持比皇國三倍大之領域之治安、故由消極的國防觀之、尙感軍備之不充分、然而蘇俄因實施五年計劃、現已保有世界最大之軍備、而且漸充實遠東之軍備俄「滿」國境不斷糾紛、而國内之許多案件及最近賴加顯明之俄國之挑戰的態度與常習之不信行爲、實使吾人不敢逆料此後日俄關係將如何推移、故爲準備一旦遭遇情勢變化之時、須備有完全之兵力及充實之裝備、此乃爲時局對策之最要事也、（一）擴張航空兵力及民間航空之急務、若合計俄之三千架、美之三千架及中國之五百架、卽圍繞日本之列國空軍勢力超過六千架、雖以外交政略能制限敵國爲一國、最小限度、尙須預想有敵國空中勢力三千架、然日本僅有一千架左右之陸軍航空力、尙可稱國防完備乎、</p>
<p>國防與經濟之調整　現經濟機搆、對於我國之經濟的發展、雖曾有大貢獻、但就國家全體、尤其就國防之觀點來看、尙有如左之改善調整底餘地、現經濟機搆旣以個人主義爲基本原則而發達、故從另一方面言、此種經濟浩動、乃有放任個人利益之濫暢的傾向、於是遂不能與國家國民全般之利益一致、而自由競爭激化之結果、又有釀成抑他思想及階級對立觀念之恐怖、富之偏在造成國民大衆之貧困、失業、中小產業與農民之没落、以致國民生活不能安定、現經濟機搆之國家的統制力小、故對於資源開發、產業振興、貿易促進等、不便爲一元的運用而動員全力、又因國家預算甚受限制、以致在國防上之絶對必要的施設、甚至不能實現、對於現經濟機搆改革之方案、雖有種種之意見、但就國防之見地言、則可列舉如下、基於建國之理想、立國於道義的經濟觀念、以增進國家之發展及國民全體之福慶、促進國民全體之活動、使各能應其勤勞所得、以資國民大衆之生活安定、改善金融諸制度及產業之經營、以期儘可能地開發資源、振興產業、促進貿易及充實國防之施設、在不違反國家之要求的範圍内、使個人方面滿足其個人創業與企業慾、以愈發增大其勤勞心、整理税制以求租課之眞正達於公平原則、戰時經濟之確立、戰時不定資源之企業的奬勵、不足資源之貯藏、代用品之研究、戰時海外資源取得之計劃、······平時均須利用之以促進國防產業的實行而過剩生產品之輸出對策、戰時財政金融對策、貿易對策勞動對策等、尤須平時加以廣泛的研究、以完成其準備、</p>

<p>美國主張討論政治問題</p>
<p>日本揚言不惜退出會議</p>
<p>（倫敦）　由華盛頓寄來之報告觀之、一九三五年海軍會議初步談話在本年十月間舉行、似有擴充範圍之可能、此間人士對於此事、極感興趣、惟英國政府見地似尙來决定、官塲以爲初步談話之程序如何及其參加入數之多寡、在大部分範圍之内、須視日本態度而定、目前所當了然之問題爲倫敦海約是否延長、抑係另訂新約、但如日本提議廢止華盛頓海約、則遠東各國力量均等又成問題、而談話之範圍將大爲推廣、此時任何推測雖均嫌太早、但一般人預料、如各國提議以纯粹海軍以外之問題列入議程之内、則英國政府亦不致反對云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　軍縮會議代表台維斯與海軍總參謀長史丹萊、將於十月十日前往倫敦、參加海縮會議初步談判、當此時間、美國政府高級人員、顯然憂慮日英兩國同時反對美國、此種憂慮所由起、係因接得消息、謂日本凖備要求减少裝甲艦總噸數、易詞言之卽美國勢難按照現行海軍條約機續保有三萬五千噸之軍艦、而英日兩國則可藉此而建造噸數較小隻數較多之軍艦、似此美國若欲保有三萬五千噸之軍艦、勢必减少隻數而後可、顧美國有事于太平洋之時、又非保持行動範圍較大之軍艦不爲功、以故日本方面縮减裝甲艦總噸數之計畫、必將引起美國方面一致之反對、自可斷言、卽謂美國寗願廢棄現行海軍條約、而必不接受此種計畫、亦無不可、此外聞日本又擬主張各國停止建造輔助艦、而以目下所有者爲限度、此在美國按之現行海軍條約、仍可建造十一萬五千噸之數者、自亦非所願聞也、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　美國軍縮政策、自海軍參謀長史丹萊出馬以後、漸次顯明其輪廓、表示反對日本廢除比率主義之主張、始終維持現行比率之態度、日美之間根本意見旣然不相容、軍縮預備會議前途不可避免决裂、但英國對此態度如何、爲日海軍極關心之事、英國對於華府及倫敦兩條約雖不滿意、然觀察其國内情形、財政回復徐徐不進、一九三七年以後造艦經費頗難籌獲、交涉如陷决裂、則對美法政策更增困難、英政府爲避免發生此種情形起見、極力考慮萬全方法、以期會議圓滿成功、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　美國代表部主張擴大一九三五年海軍會議議題、討論政治問題、英國亦謂、日本通告廢除華府條約、則不可避免提起政治問題、日政府尙未充分知悉英美官方意圖、但前次預備會議、曾以絶對不討論政治問題爲條件出席會議、日本如此立塲將來亦無改變、故英美主張如係確實、則日本决定不參加會議、又會議中途提議政治問題、則立卽退出會揚、（五日日聯電）</p>

<p>東北四省中栽植鴉片區。吉林有十八縣。興安全區。熱河省各地。遼寗則有長白·臨江等若干縣。其栽培面積。總計在六萬五千頃以上。收穫量將超過一百萬担。我國受烟害久矣。自鴉片戰後。外毒之輸入。迄未能絶。近正在國際間謀所以取締之法。而僞滿如此大舉種烟。非特爲彼增加收入計。實亦欲禍我中國。以陷我民族於歷刧不復之境也。</p>
<p>我國人民近已漸次自覺。每多自動戒烟者。良以個人經濟。旣日感枯渴。而鴉片之刺激性。究不能及近代文明之深刻。惟我北部各省區。一般生活單簡。民間幾無娱樂可言。於是彼乃乘此弱點。以鴉片製爲嗎啡。其初賣價甚賤。吸食尤便。故「白麵」在冀·綏·晋·豫·各省中非常流行。而被毒之深。爲禍之烈實遠過於鴉片。蓋鴉片尙易戒除。「白麵」則一旦上瘾。卽深入膏肓而不可救。彼旣强奪我東北四省。又知我當地人民之不甘屈服。我國農民性質。雖不免習於守舊。而忍勞負重。却爲特長。日人深懼我人民運用此點。爲持久之反抗。故於奪據四省之後。首先卽開放烟禁。任一般中下級社會分子。自由吸食。同時更設爲種種引誘。以期消滅我國人民之活動。换言之。卽所以消滅我民族之抵抗力也。</p>
<p>不觀夫被日人統治後之台灣乎。其人民反抗。所以僅止於呼號者。固由於地小人稀。土産富厚。人皆安於現狀所致。而鴉片之麻醉。使地方有爲之青年。盤旋於香烟燎繞中。消失其上進之勇氣。亦與有力焉。頃者東北之大量栽種嬰粟。其用意豈止於毒害四省人民而已。行將見其運送入關。使冀魯各省無凈土。甚或傳播於長江流域之市塲。以爲從前印度土商勢力機。茲事也。實爲我國人民當前之巨禍。且有遺毒子孫之憂。是以吾人應下最大决心。爲民族將來計。爲國家生存計。從速實行肅清烟毒。而對於東北四省之來源。尤宜特别注意焉。</p>
<p>政府現正嚴厲禁烟。一再明令依期戒絶。苟能堅持不懈。則烟土之來源。自可望逐漸斷絶。惟此種烟禍。種因旣久。毒源又深。祇恃法令之禁制。恐仍不足以收絶對的效果。是以道德上之自制。亦足輔助法令之不及。社會動力。發於民間。倘各種團體。能多方勸戒。先使有職業者斷絶鴉片。以唤起各個人之自覺。則已吸者自必倣戒。未吸者永不霑染。我能先自拒絶。則人雖百方設阱。謀害我民族。又將奚益哉。</p>

<h3 id="c222">新式眞空管的分類比較觀 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>眞空管日新月增，式號繁多，喜自製收音機的同志，往往無從選擇，其實通常交流機採用的眞空管，可依其絲極電壓，分爲２·５v及６·３v兩大類，此兩類間有許多眞空管之特性，頗多雷同或類似的，茲再依其構造特性，分類比較之。</p>
<p>（一）三極管　先自三極管開始，在２·５v類内，有２７及５６兩種，可與６·３v類的３７及７６相當，５６與７６，除絲極電壓電流不同外，其特性功用全完相同，至於２７與３７則稍有參差，３７的陰極較小，其互導屏流亦均稍弱，但實際設計時，效用完全視爲無異。</p>
<p>（二）雙屏三極管（Diode_Priode）　雙屏三極管者，卽普通三極管内，另添一對屏極，在２·５v類内，有５５及２Ａ６，同時５·３v類亦有８５及７５，可與之分别相當，特性完全相同。５５與２Ａ６之所以不同者，僅以５５之放大係數爲８·３，而２Ａ６爲Ioo，故如需輸出電力較大時，以採用２Ａ６爲宜。</p>
<p>（三）不變冪四極管及五極管　此類眞空管的主要任務，爲無極外差機的第一及第二檢波管，２·５v類内有２４及５７，在６·３v類内，能與之相當者，有４６，６Ｃ６及７７，３６與２４係四極管，除３６之陰極較小，絲極耗費之電力較弱外，其他特性效用，與２４頗相類似；５７，７７，６Ｃ６均係五極管，７７與６Ｃ６，構造上頗多不同處，但電的特性，仍完全一致，如７７之管内隔離，係圍繞屏極，而６Ｃ６之隔離，則在屏極之上；７７之管内隔離，其優點雖可减少收音機之隔離裝置，然因輸出電容量同時增加，對於高週率綫路，頗多不利。</p>
<p>（四）變冪四極管及五極管　收音機之高週率放大或中間週率放大級，採用此項眞空管，最爲相宜，在２·５v類内，式號較少，僅３５與５８兩種，３５實與２４相同，５８亦與５７類似，所不同者，僅前者多一變冪作用耳。在６·３v類堪與之相當者，有３９，４４，６Ｄ６，及７８諸式，之變冪作用較弱於３５，困３９專爲汽車收音機適用，其輸入信號之强度，自不若户内收音機之裝有高大天綫者可比。７８之特性，處於３９與６Ｄ６之間，４４則可視爲與３９完全相同，可交互替用。上述諸管，除３５外，均有一鎭壓柵，成五極管。</p>
<p>（五）特種眞空管　或稱混合管（Combination　Tube)，亦屬複作用眞空管的一種，在２·５v類有２Ａ７及２Ｂ７，５·３v類内亦有６Ａ７及６Ｂ７與之相當，６Ａ７常作無極外差機的週率變换器，另有一柵極專供振盪之用，故毋需再設振盪管。２Ｂ７與６Ｂ７均爲雙屏五極管，雙屏可作檢波之用，五極部份，以之作成音週率或中間週率放大，均屬相宜。</p>
<p>（六）强力輸出管　２·５v類的强力輸出管，式號頗多，４５，２Ａ３，４６，均係燈絲式三極管，２Ａ３較４５爲優，因能輸出較大電力，而失眞度極微，４６用作Ａ類放大時，其輸出較小於４５，如用作Ｂ類放大時，則較４５爲强，但失眞度較２Ａ３爲甚。４７與２Ａ５係五極强放管，其特性極類似，惟後者爲陰極式，交流聲可大爲减少，以此，似較４７爲優。此外，復有５９號者，兼有４７及４６之效用，因有三個柵極接至管外，祇需變更綫路之接法，可使適合某種功用。６·３v類的强力輸出管，僅有４２，４Ｉ，８９三號，４２與２Ａ５之特性雷同，４Ｉ僅輸出稍弱，至於３９可視爲小型的５９，因其特性效用，亦多相同者。</p>
<h3 id="c223">狂呌的一個原因 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>最近一個朋友裝了一隻三管機，眞空管是用一隻三三檢渡，二隻三十低放，全機如電池外，都裝在一隻美麗木箱裏，不料裝好後試聽狂呌之聲不絶，因此把低周率變壓器初級ＰＢ對掉，結果無效，後來疑心柵路和屏路接綫平行了，仔細檢查，同時把可疑的地方重行接過，這弊病便好了，但是將收音機放進箱匣裏去時，却依舊狂呌，然而從箱匣裏拿出來時，狂呌就止，因此我决定這狂呌定與擴聲器有關（因爲擴聲器是裝在箱子裏的）但擴聲器在箱之上部，收音機在箱之下部，與變壓器等都有相當距離，决不會因配合而起狂呌，仔細觀察之下，才將緣故發現原來擴聲器上的接線因爲太長，没有把牠紥起，而恰巧落在柵電容器和柵漏上，因此屏路和柵路因配合而生狂呌，當時就把餘下的擴聲器上的綫（卽喇叭綫）紥起狂呌，就没有了，所以我們在把擴聲器和收音機裝在一處時，擴聲器上的綫，却也要加以注意。</p>
<h3 id="c224">自動調節輸出電壓的代電器 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>在乙類放大器中，柵壓不宜以電器的源供給之；因爲變動的柵流回流入代電器，易使電源變化，柵壓不得穏定，工作遂致不良。若欲减少其電壓變化，厥惟二法；一在輸出處跨接一低耗阻的分流器；一使荷載保持常值。然使用低耗阻的分流器，損失電力過大，太不經濟；所有應討論第二法，使荷載保持常值，其變化幾等於零。</p>
<p>如圖所示，卽爲自動調節輸出電壓的代電器。其與普通代電器所不同的，除整流管與濾波裝置外，復有一調節眞空管（Regulation　Vocuum_Tube）簡稱調節管；及自柵耗阻器RI，其價值須需數百萬歐姆，俾調節管在無荷載時，恰截止屏流。輸出的電壓等於代電器總電壓减去調節管有截止屏流時所需電壓之較。</p>
<p>此代電器用於乙類放大器中供給柵壓，則電流回入調節管，該管遂有柵流；因此，經過調節管的電壓加增，而自柵耗阻器ＲＩ的電壓减少。調節管與ＲＩ耗阻器間的降壓總和必等於電源的總壓；旣ＲＩ的電壓减少，卽調節管柵壓减少，遂使屏極總阻减低。跨接於其上的輸出電壓，經此控制，不受荷載而變化，能保持常值了。</p>
<p>此器若用於乙類放大器中供給穏定的屏壓，其綫路與上述控制柵壓的雷同。惟ＲＩ值减少，使調節管無外負荷時，通過的電流恰爲最高平均荷載電流時的兩倍。</p>
<p>當接外荷載後，經過自柵耗阻器ＲＩ的電流加增。調節管的柵壓旣增，使屏流减少；因此，外荷載電流遂得增大。一减一增，恰相抵償，致輸出電壓能保持於常穏。</p>

<p>一天。同學吴君。託我代他裝天地裝天地綫。他是個寄宿生。得到了學校當局的許可。便在三層樓的洋臺上裝了天綫（約有七十五尺）天綫裝好了。接着就要裝地綫。但是自來水龍頭離宿所很遠（離自來水的鉛管亦很遠）。打鐵條又被同學們所弄壞。我偶然看見窗外有一棵大樹。樹枝離窗口極近。不覺異想天開。以爲樹有導電性。便把銅絲縛在樹枝上。接在收音機上一聽。成績果然不錯。所以今天寫出來供獻給諸位。</p>

<p>第二回　作貿入民間緊回永壽别家來天上人到長安</p>
<p>那女孩子將四個門牙咬了袖口，也只是低頭看了地面上。賈多才忽然轉個念頭，這全是自己錯了，旣然很贊賞這個女孩子，怎好讓人家太難堪了。於是個那老婦人道：你們旣然也到了西安，那就很好，慢慢的總可以想點法子，你們住在那裏呢？那中年婦看了賈多才一眼，向後退了一步，分明有什麽話要説，忽然一害羞，又朝後忍回去了。還是那老婦人，看到這位老爺，不爲無意，就揷言道：這孩子爸爸在那裏，我們是没有得着信息。這孩子舅舅也過去了，舅娘倒是在這裏，我們就住在那裏。這孩子舅娘帶我們出來看看，我們像到了天宮裏一樣，捨不得回去，她先走了。現在我們正爲着難，不知道怎樣回家去呢。賈多才道：你們親戚住在那裏呢？我送你們回去得了。老婦人手扶了樹幹，昻着頭想道：什麽巷子？那中年婦向她一擺頭道：不！我記得在天上。賈李二人，都不由笑了起來。中年婦紅了臉笑道：不，不，是個什麽天後頭。那姑娘實在忍不住了，就一偏頭，向他們瞪了眼道：你們的記心眞壞，不就是小西天後面王家巷子八號嗎？這一點事都不記得，還出來尋什麽人呢？賈多才道：那好極了，我們就住在小西天，我們一路引你回去好了。那兩個婦人，没有説可以，也没有説不可以，只是將身子向後退了兩步，有點讓賈李二人向前走的意思。賈多才點點頭道：你們跟了我走罷。（三四）</p>
<h3 id="c228">王壬秋之上海觀 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>距今四十五年前的光緒十五年，文學家王壬秋要到天津去，看李鴻章，路過上海，（那時京漢路還没築，長江裏的輪船倒已經有得駛行了，所以他繞圏兒到上海的。）躭擱了好幾天，看他的日記，有幾椿事情，可以見到他老人家對於上海有怎樣的觀念？</p>
<p>「至丹桂園，燈戲頗爲工巧熱鬧」。上一天他已經到過天仙園看戲，後來還去過一次，可知他是一個享樂主義者，並且可知他是外家，所以只賞識他們的工巧和熱鬧，不像羅廮公李釋戡一輩子有内家的看法。</p>
<p>「搢階來言，請買辦之非，云士商不可爲朋，况買辦夷奴，而學士與周旋，甚乖於禮。此言與余合，然與時局不合。」因爲白天有人請王壬秋去陪輪船買辦吃飯，他没有去。這一番議論，迂得可笑，後來那一個學士，不和買辦往來呢？但是老先生還算明白，説與時局不合，比那位搢階先生高一籌。</p>
<p>「入新北門至城隍廟，······出城看大自鳴鐘，乃别而還。上海街屋隘暗，猶見海遙荒縣之制，城人亦多，未知何處容之？」這是他指上海城内而言，當時的確狠「隘暗，」可是他懷疑於人多，何以爲生？倒是一個留心民生的人。倘然現在他趁火車到上海，見到旅館的多而富麗，更要驚訝何來如許闊客呢？</p>
<p>「書館妓女九人彈唱六曲，花錢二百文，似廉甚，貴游戲無賤如此者。」大約是四馬路的女説書，在四十多年前的生活程度，不過如此，就是現在的青蓮閣，也不過兩毛錢啊，怎的王老先生已經認爲便宜得了不得呢？</p>
<p>雖然這些事，都是很瑣碎的，但是中間已經過許多變化，要是講給現在的青年們聽，已要認做奇談了；倘然再隔幾十年，翻到今天的春秋，怕不要看做上古史料麽？</p>

<p>在杭州，上了孤山，預備到曼殊大師的歸宿處，可是不認識途徑。因此就問路人：「蘇曼殊的墳墓在那兒？」但是他們把我領到蘇小小的墓那裏去。想不到妓女因爲自古文人宣傳的緣故，倒能名傳千古。有許多文人，却没有人紀念他，認識他。</p>
<h3 id="c230">厠所文學 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 夫凡</p>
<p>任何人看了這題目，一定以爲我將「厠所」和文學」連綴在一起，是侮蔑了文學的尊嚴，挑起了文學家的反感。但我絶不顧慮到這些，文學的尊嚴和文學家清貴，並不能阻止厠所文學的存在。你看現在各學校只要有厠所，那一處不是塗得琳瑯滿目，極洋洋之大觀？</p>
<p>我們曉得，某一種文學總有某一種格調和風味的，但學校裏厠所文學，却經過一次痛快的解放，要寫什麽，就寫什麽，没有一切體制和外觀上的束縳。它裏面含有我們祖先傳下來的八股文，有摩登人物必學的新詩歌；有簡明的救國計劃，有生動的抗日口號；有皇后小姐的月旦評，有公子哥兒的風流史；有衰感頑艶的情書，有桑間陌上的趣話；有鄉下鄙俚而肉麻的稱呼，有張競生博士所常用的術語；有滑稽的遊戲小品，有幽默的諷刺文字；有校長敎職員的功過錄，有名流大人物的褒貶詞；有聞所未聞的秘密消息，有見所未見的新奇學理；有富於刺激性的圖書，有難於索解的燈謎，有尖的哲學，有駡人的藝術。······有······</p>
<p>有人説：『厠所是學生自然而眞實的意見箱。』我想來這話是不錯的，所以我現在有一個提議，就是敎育家要考查一個學校，先要從隠微處着手，最好能降低身份，到厠所去巡閲一次，那末關於一校學生的成績，思想，和意見，就可以得一個簡明的輪廓了。</p>

<p>— 朱瘦桐</p>
<p>薄暮的時候，殘陽像血樣的紅，染着天空半壁，仿彿少女淺飲，朱顏微酡般的嬌艶；遠遠地襯着幾叢碧綠樹林，覺得格外可愛。在這裏，透出雀兒們的喧噪，有時偶然一二隻冲出樹梢，很迅速的飛去。</p>
<p>白楊，梧桐的葉子，經不起再番風吹雨打，都辭着枝頭，在空中飛舞了一回，飄散在四周的道旁。踐踏了這些敗葉前進，發出一種細碎的聲音，仰望着蔚藍的天空，孤雁帶着凄絶的哀音，懷了寂寞的心腸，缓缓地飛向它歇宿的地方。輕微的角聲，隨風送入耳鼓，斗的勾起我不可言狀的憂鬰。漂泊的游子，滿深着創痕的心坎，那裏遭受得住這幽咽的笳聲襲撃呢？</p>
<p>池畔蘆蔁，吐出潔白的花兒，臨風顫動，瘦弱可憐。　前，籬下，時見一二殘花，點綴這冷落的村野。</p>
<p>這一帶，都是羊腸般的小徑，没有轔轔的車聲，震動澄清的空氣；也没有妖媚婦女的足跡，印上這清香的泥土。在那炊烟四起的當兒，祇有肩着鐵鋤，信口亂唱，很愉快地，大着脚步向歸途中走去的農夫。</p>

<h3 id="c233">羅陽異味錄（上） <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>羅店，别名羅谿，又稱羅陽，我的故鄉，是寳山縣屬的首鎭。這鎭位處西鄕，和嘉定縣接壤，風水清嘉，俗尙醇美，時生人傑，也饒物華。單論食品一門，羅店有好多可口的東西，爲别處所不及。西風起了，我也不免動蓴羹鱸膾之思，就在這裏不厭絮絮如數如家珍，且來談談故鄕風味。若有老饕因此大動食指，可以立刻往滬北太陽廟，搭乘滬太長途汽車，不須一小時便可到逹羅店，親嘗異味，順便在鎭上巡禮一回，也是一樂。現在有孫丈誕石和諸位鄕老們籌建羅陽公園，我也被推忝爲贊助委員之一，待公園在最近的將來告成了，滬人士前往短足清避，鼓腹大嚼，當更能盡興而歸哩！羅店吃品，簡直美不勝收，略舉幾件，以作小小垂涎的資料：</p>
<p>一，茶肴之部</p>
<p>紅燒羊肉　這裏所舉的茶肴，是羅店人家家常也善於烹煮的。他們所作紅燒羊肉，妙在毫不腥臊，火候逹到肉酥而未爛，湯汁稠黏，入口肥腴，鮮甜無比！西鄕人家的菜肴，如蘇崑一帶，本重甜頭，而羅店紅燒羊肉的甜味，恰是需要到這程度，不嫌其甜的。一碗熱騰騰的紅燒羊肉在餐室門口端進來時，遠遠地已能聞得一陳甜香，使人胃口大開，食慾亢進了！我家貼鄰有一個做廚子的，名呌阿香保，做這道菜最爲拿手。</p>
<p>清湯魚圓　魚圓各地都有，獨是羅店人做的魚圓，聽説裏頭配合有鷄蛋，山藥，和其他特殊的作料，所以特别的鮮美。他嫩得勝過嫩荳腐，入口一悶而化。他又有特别潔白的顏色，和純無細滓的清湯，非别處所製可及，敎人看了也可愛的。這正是可餐的秀色，合着一句形容急色兒見了當前美色的話：「恨不得一口水把他吞下肚去！」這清湯魚圓，就敎一個人連吃幾碗也不會厭的。</p>
<p>燒𩸩魚　這𩸩魚又名「白潔」，（不知潔字是不是這樣寫法）又稱「𩸩老鼠」，因爲他是水老鼠變成的，人家這樣説。這種魚在西鄕獨多，不大容易在上海或别處買到的。他的長處在於多肉，皮與其近處及頭部很肥，尤其是兩頦；愛吃𩸩魚的人最是愛他的肥。這𩸩魚在家常是紅燒的多，在筵席裏白燒着也各有所長。今春我凑巧參與恰在羅店舉行的寳山全縣公務員聯歡會（？），在那席上吃到白燒大𩸩魚的頦塊，而益歎他的肥腴有讚美的價值哩！（這魚名的讀音如「會」，不知這𩸩字有誤不，未暇查考，待正。）</p>
<p>熏鯽魚和燻田鷄　西鄕的河道是死水，清澈見底，所產魚蝦，水族之屬，易得巨大的，而味也特鮮。挺大的鯽魚，燻了更加馨香開胃，他須經過油煎的手續，透得細骨可以和食，免了檢骨之煩。燻鯽魚由家常所煮，那風味却勝過一切茶食店所賣的燻青魚不知多少。至於燻田鷄，是有沿街呌賣的，形大而肉細；也有燻過的田鷄肺成堆地可買，那細腻祇有鷄舌差可相擬，竟會令人捨不得一氣吃完他。燻田鷄和田鷄肺雖不大列入正式的筵席，但佐酒小酌，是很相宜的。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>往常，我們總是很不容易在任何一道河流的旁邊，見到有多少樹木；原因是爲了中國人的習慣，向來不知道注重園林的建設。一般窮苦人家，爲着没有錢買燃料的綠故，更爭先恐後的到處斫取樹木，以致除掉十分荒僻的區域，如吉林，黑龍江等等以外，中國本部，幾無一處森林；便是稍成行列的樹木，也少有。而在這一條長河的左右，却有很整齊的兩行樹木種着；絲絲下垂，像一簇簇綠線似的楊柳，在水面上徐徐飄拂，中間還來着開得像紅錦似的桃花，這情景端的可愛煞人。</p>
<p>太后看到了這樣美麗的景緻，那裏就肯輕輕錯過，堅執着要吩咐停車，讓伊自己下車去小步一回。伊的意志當然是没有人能挽回的，于是這一列黄色火車，便在中途停了下來。車上凡有執事的人，少不得一齊隨着伊下去了。但是下車，要自由行動却不能；只有太后和我們幾個侍從女官，可以隨意走動走動。在車上端端整整的站立了許多時候之後，這種輕微的運動，實在是十二分需要的。因爲其餘的人都得照着宮中原有的規矩，向太后肅立致敬；不過那些太監也是可以往來奔走的，太監本來不能算是人，所以也可以讓他們自由了。只苦了那一班隨駕大臣，都像泥塑木彫似的站立着，眼睛也不能向四面眺望，必須永遠注視着太后，以便太后要有什麽話説給那一個人聽的時候，這個人就可立刻走上去。（一四四）</p>

<p>— 華子</p>
<p>因爲知道我近來的生活情况不佳，一位數年前的同學（但也疏遠了數年了）一天晚上特地走到我的庽所，説已代我謀得了一個職位，待遇也不惡，説畢留下了一封介紹信，呌我翌晨去看某君。他説，「我覺得你是個應得有較好生活的人，我的家内的人也都説你是個『好』人，逼着我代你注意，現在幸而已成功了」。我心中雖然没有怎樣雀躍，像失業了許久而一旦得了業似的，他的一種誠摯的好意，却不得不使我感動。</p>
<p>走去一問，原來不過是做稿的事。且也不是什麽特約或長期撰述，而祇是每種刋物在後面都登着投稿條例的程度的做稿。我倒也不怎樣失望，因爲我始初就没有怎樣的期待。我很明白，我的久疏了的同學是習工程的，他是上了小小的當了。但他的上了小小的當，也不是人家故意騙他的。他自己也不知道受了騙，反而心中感到了無上的愉快，覺得自己已做了一椿對得住老友的事情了。人生怱怱，能有幾回嘗得到如此的愉快呢？</p>
<p>世上的人，大致可以分爲兩種典型。一是生下來受人騙的，一是生下來就是一副懷疑的骨子，雖不一定欺人，至少也是不輕易受人的欺的。前一種人，是所謂獃子，過份的「老實頭」，至少也具帶幾分獃氣的人；後者則常表現爲瀟灑倜儻的思慮者，懷疑者。前者的極端的例，我們可舉吉訶德先生，後者則十九世紀末期俄國小説中頗不乏其例。</p>
<p>世界的成功家，也多帶一些獃氣的。因爲世界本身就是冒險，假若左右懷疑，那裏還有成功的希望？至於戀愛則更然。前者視戀愛爲第二生命，後者視之爲一種遊戲。但得到了最大的戀愛的蝴醍味的，當然是前者。阿那托爾，法郎士的小説「泰綺斯」，其主人公巴夫紐斯，是一個嚴格的禁慾主義者，但爲了一個舞女泰綺斯，竟至抛棄了自己的信仰；但得到了戀愛的三昧的，嘗得了人生的眞諦的，却是他而不是尼西亞斯。</p>
<p>易受騙者的偉大和幸福！祇有他們，才能嘗到人生的眞味，戀愛的意義。何怪有人説，「經過了人和的青年期及壯年期而逹初老之域的人，當靜靜地回顧過去時，祇有後悔其戀愛生活中不幸一次也未曾受過騙，决没有後悔其受了一次騙的。」</p>

<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>昨日寫完「蚌壳生羅漢」那篇文章，今天又記起清慵訥居士咫聞錄卷三有「蚌中珠佛」一條。</p>
<p>「蚌中珠佛」的故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>乾隆乙未年五月，江南大旱，巢縣巢湖裏的水也乾了，船都不能行動。一天夜裏，月光很好。一個漁夫忽然看見船頭有凉風吹來，水深尺多，好像有什麽東西在那裏呼吸，又尋找不出。他就把船上的小風帆掛起，趁風走去。直到天光，已經走了一百多里，風息了，水又乾了，船還是走不動。他看見一個大蚌，好像木盆那麽大，很有光彩，不覺奇怪起來，把蚌壳剖開，裏面有珠佛一座，眉目身體，一毫不缺，每到夜裏就要發光。他携着這隻大蚌到珠賓店子去寄賣，恰好那個時候有西洋某國的入貢使臣，見了非常愛悦，願拿三萬兩銀子買去。不料漁夫貪心難足，希望更高的價錢，所以遲了許多没有賣出。後來再去問那使臣，使臣説道：「從前你要買給我，價錢加一倍都可以，如今就連一文錢都不値了。」漁夫聽了，很驚駭的問他道：「你爲什麽從前肯出高價錢，現在倒説一錢不値呢？」他説：「從前蚌珠很好，又可栽培，用藥去養牠，還可以長大。如今蚌已死了，不過是一個雕刻的東西，供人賞玩罷了。」漁夫仍然把蚌携到賓店子去賣，僅僅得錢五百文。</p>
<p>這當然又是一段神話。</p>
<h3 id="c255">迴讀屋與青年 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 傅紅蓼</p>
<p>文學，給與青年們是那樣一個美麗的憧憬；但無論任何一位青年，當他們開始踏入文學底圍牆的時候，却没有一個不感茫茫然毫無所從之苦。這是説一個青年，當他從美麗的幻想，踏入實踐的時候，對於文學上派别問題，路徑問題，以及應讀某種名著，才會裨益其初學，或是選擇書本，和時代的關係等等，一切都在他們腦海中發生着阻碍，甚或至自己走到書店裏去，對着那五花八門排列的書籍，究竟不知買那一本的好。這一切，都是對於一個嗜好文學，初學文學的青年們底一種普遍的煩惱，而且這煩惱，始終遺傳着，從五四一直到現在。</p>
<p>是什麽原因，才會造成這種現象呢？當然，我們不能責備一個青年，没有選擇的天才；我們要責備的，還是我們自已的文壇，以及那些被承認或自認在文壇裏已有相當歷史，和負有相當責任的文學家們！青年們在文學系統上所應得的遺產，（這裏並不是像文學月報上所指的遺產相同。）的確是太微薄了，甚或可以説是没有。青年們要想看一本比較有系統的文學史或是文學槪論之類的書，結果他們會從書本裏看到若干種不同的事實和理論，（這種事實，在本報讀書問答裏青年們底問訊，時常可以看得到的。）要想讀一些世界名著，其結果在書本裏，也會　找到許許多多看不懂的翻譯句子。在一些刋物上，看見的只是一些意見的鬥爭，和變相的批評；他們要想在那些刋物上，獲得一些名作家們對於學習文學的修養經騐，以及誠懇地關於文學底指示，或是作家們研究文學的身邊要記，（如Note　Book）那是和幻想般一樣渺茫了。這些原因，都是損傷整個文壇元氣的要素，而也會影響到所謂「文壇裏爲什麽没有偉大作品產生」那個問題身上去。老作家們把自己成功的艱辛，都給忘掉了，而且對於青年，更是遺忘得一乾二凈；文壇裏的生力軍旣不見產生，而老作家們又難免不爲年齡所牽制，結果把整個文壇弄得了貧血症，而所謂其他的雜病，如「文言復興」便也是乘時而起，這前途，的確是不堪設想！</p>
<p>從這種現象中，我們發現「文壇是需要青年，青年是需要着指導！」不但嗜好文學的青年如此，卽在大學院裏的青年，也是如此！</p>
<p>在三卷一號的文學月報裏，有一篇「大學文，」學那是一篇大學文學院底通訊。那裏有很切實的描寫，是説一個文學院裏的文學人，他們幾乎不知道文學；原因是和中國文壇太漠然無關之故。雖然他們也讀的許多世界文學書籍，但他們自己都説不出自己倒底幹什麽，和一些文學上的眞意義。他們雖然知道文學院是從事文學工作，但事實這種人材，却難得出於文學院。可見青年們在文學上是怎樣的失途，而同時又需要着怎樣有益的指導！</p>
<p>眼前，要想補救這種缺憾，我以爲應當模倣日本所設立的一種有組織有系統的「迴讀屋」。</p>
<p>「迴讀屋」，是日本一種專租文學書籍雜誌的書店，每月納費三元，定一份「迴讀」書，他們就會每三天送一本書來。隨便什麽大作品，書名由自己選擇，每月可看十册書。</p>
<p>這種辦法，對青年的確的確是太有益了，一方面旣可以免掉青年們書籍費的重負担，同時更可以督促着，增加了青年們的看書慾，的確是値得倣行的事。</p>
<p>「迴讀屋」式的書店，在中國也何曾没有，不過那裏所租借給青年流覧的，都是一些劍俠和張恨水式的小説，新文學的書籍，簡直一本都没有。所以眼前，我們覺得「迴讀屋」式的新文學租書店，是非常須要的。我們底辦法是須由許多在文學上有功績，有修養的人來主辦，選擇世界上眞有價値的文學書籍，對於租書的人，發給一種表格，使他們塡寫。凡對於初入文學園地的青年，可以由我們替他們代選定了對文學研究有系統的書。送給他們去看，使其對於文學上，不會感到一種那樣紛亂；而且在這經濟不景氣的現社會，這種减輕書籍負担，更是須要的事！</p>
<p>當然，我們並不主張使青年們死板地研究文學，但這種辦法，至低是會很有裨益於「初學的」青年們的！</p>
<h3 id="c256">翻譯今年又盛行了 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>繙譯的東西，曾經被人看作「媒婆」而一直輕視下來的，你看中國譯作多麽稀少，就可知道。至於内容全是譯作的雜誌之不能見到，那是不用説的了。</p>
<p>而今年，情形有點變異了。</p>
<p>起先是「文學」來了個繙譯專號。「有計劃的繙譯是必要的；同時，打破那種鄙視繙譯的空氣，也是必要的」。從這幾句話里，我們對於出繙譯專號之苦心，是表示甚深的同情的。可是，單就由一個雜誌出本專號便够了嗎？</p>
<p>於是相隔了半年，「譯文」出現了。</p>
<p>關於「譯文」，有人説過了，這里從略吧。</p>
<p>緊接着「譯文」而出現的，是「世界文學」。</p>
<p>這又是以繙譯爲主的，以「介紹各國文學，估量它對於世界文學抑卽新文學的價値；登載内容或形式可以取資的作品；作絶對客觀的態度，探求中國文學走向世界文學的徑途」（見發刋詞）爲目的的刋物。</p>
<p>姑放下其洋洋萬言的發刋詞不論；單就其創刋號的内容來説，我以爲，這是一本値提介紹的刋物。</p>
<p>我佩服能寫下極佳的作品的作家；我有時郤更其佩服能將外國偉大名著譯得很好的人。這種苦工作有時比創作更難，甚至需要一種低能的蠻勁的。你不能説一部莎士比亞的名著究竟不是中國的作品，因而不去睬它；反之，托爾斯泰，高爾基，左拉諸家的著作介紹到中國來，顯然是有其意義的。</p>
<p>尤其是我們從事寫作的人，能够在他們的作品里去找點可以學習的東西，究竟是好的。</p>
<p>不過事實昭示我們，中國譯作常常不被歡迎，是因爲有的使人實在看不懂的緣故。這種不忠實的譯作一旦在市塲上多起來，敎人一聽見繙譯就頭痛。「因噎廢食」是不行的，能够譯得好東西的人也是有的，可是一般的讀衆却無耐心去選擇，於是乎繙譯很遭了一下厄運。</p>
<p>値此「譯文」，「世界文學」創刋之際，我希望在内容上，極力使之完善；譯什麽，怎樣譯，都得好好考慮一下，如果能由是而轉移一下目前讀衆的態度，那麽，所謂「雜誌年」究竟有了點功績了。</p>
<p>還有，「現代」也出了美國文學專號，使繙譯的聲氣更加大起來。願從此有更多的外國佳作介紹到中國來，恐怕創作的進步，多少也有頼於此的咧。</p>

<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>「孝子」二字，本來有幾種解説：（一）孝子是父母去孝兒子，不是兒子去孝父母，這呌做孝子，（二）孝子不過孝在嘴上，所以呌做「孝嘴」，眞的，這些話已是「古話」，不去説他，但總是「孝子」。</p>
<p>昨天我在朋友書桌上，偶然看見一本厚厚的訃告，我揭開來一看，上至國府要人，（除孫總理没有題詞外）下至滬上名流，多有他們極口稱揚的讚語呀！眞是了不得，我連聲稱讚道，孝子！孝子！</p>
<p>後我在行述中，找找他的事業，也一些兒找不到他的豐功偉跡，不過説盡力公益事業，有功革命不小等等的空頭話，呀！更是了不得，這樣的人物，居然也人人稱道，個個讚揚，眞是了不得。</p>
<p>我後來推敲他的原因，原來是父以子貴，亦是一種顯親揚名之道，但是，但是······不是兒子養得好，那裏會有這樣的榮宗耀祖的成績出來，因此父以子貴，而子亦以父貴了，不是孝子不及此。</p>
<p>於是乎我疑心到「孝子」二字如前兩説，或還有差誤，現在孝是大家不講了，講起孝子，大家有些兒頭痛，故就拿事實來看，也只有看見「孝紙」，而没有看見孝子，故與其説他是孝子，不若説他是「孝紙」較爲切實罷。</p>

<p>楓葉像喝了過量的葡萄酒，醉得滿臉通紅，和瘦黄的柳葉，被無情的西風，一片片地從生活力日益衰弱的母枝上趕了下來，縱横地睡在任來往行人踏踐着的人行道上，在低首地嘆息！</p>
<p>天，顯現得怪莊嚴。晚風，蕭蕭地在吹着；挾着人馬奔騰的聲音！我踽踽地在秋的原野裏獨行，全身的每個細胞都在收縮着；這時，我眞有點悚然！</p>
<p>桂花被西風吹開了，吐放着馥郁的芳香！是栽在後園的東南邊的一個角落裏；靠着牠的兩旁的是幾顆衰柳。在蒼蒼地暮靄裏，有兩三個小孩在從瓦片中，牆隙裏尋求「喞喞，喞喞」的小虫。</p>
<p>母親牽着伶慧的三妹從後門走出，滿臉堆着笑容現出極慈祥地；指着那顆正開花的桂樹對我説：「這是你祖父手植的！」</p>
<p>「是在這屋做起來的後一年。」她又指了自己的住屋，補上了一個註脚。</p>
<p>祖父，我是没有看見過：「手植」這兩個字，在我那時稚弱的腦府裏，倒有點欠解。可是我對桂花的發生好感，却是在把牠的花瓣摘下，經過日光一晒，貯藏在瓶子裏，用鹽醃了之後拿來泡茶，倒覺清香可口！所以到了圍爐的時候或者是新年裏，鄰居的人們，都歡喜到我家來喝「桂花茶」。</p>
<p>這是五年前的事，我一點也没有記錯；現在追想起來，好像還是昨天！可是時光有點像小偸，不經意地就從頭上，身邊，手指旁溜過。如今，我已戴上了「成人」的冠冕，使我到處飄流，受盡了人們的白眼，嘗够了人間的酸辛，苦楚！啊，我個飄零的遊子喲！心神有如浮萍；得不看憑依，得不着慰藉！</p>
<p>紅的楓葉，瘦黄的柳葉，又隨着西風有節奏似的往下飄落，校園裏的桂花，在吐放着馥郁的芳香，可是；在五百里以外底我的家呢？</p>

<p>— 欣子</p>
<p>這年頭是個復古的年頭，不僅男女授受不親，就是别的方面反映出來的，也千奇百怪的無奇不有。譬如説，前些年頭是曾公開徵求過飛簷走壁之士過的，可是結果是失望，不僅會飛簷走壁的没有，就是連應徵的人也没有，這很使那位訪賢的大人怏怏不快，大嘆國術失傳不止的。</p>
<p>照七俠五義，施公案，彭公案，以及别的什麽武俠小説的定例，那些飛簷走壁的英雄，大都是站在「青天」大老爺一方面帮助爲民除害的。再説得開一點，就是那些看破紅塵不求名利的「半仙」了，會得騰雲駕霧，會得飛劍和别的法寳，也往往爲了主持正義起見，不惜開一開殺戒。</p>
<p>大槪眞是國術失傳了？照理，那輩無用武之地的英雄，不是正是投身報效榮宗顯親的時候嗎！可是結果，是失望，就連應徵的也一個都没有，這大槪並不是現在的英雄比較小説上的英雄清高，不求顯逹，而是「國術失傳」的緣故。</p>
<p>今年可不同了，前些年頭徵求不到的，今年可自動地出現了，不僅會飛簷走壁，並且還能使刀槍不入，卽使用的是手槍，子彈也不能打進他的身體上去，並且據他向訪問者説，他不僅會了這二樣，並且還懂得飛劍和點穴。</p>
<p>據曾經去訪問過的朋友説，那位英雄確是個很漂亮的小夥子，西裝，綢質的襯衫，咖啡色的跳舞皮鞋，頭髮梳得光光的，臉上大槪還塗過一層雪花膏，不停的抽着紙烟，要是不説穿的話，誰都不以爲這樣一個紈袴子弟型的人就是刀槍不入的英雄。</p>
<p>或許眞是時代進展了的緣故，這樣的裝飾和武俠小説裏給我的印象是完全兩樣的，但是一想到小説（尤其是武俠小説）大都是文人們所造的空中樓閣，心裏也就釋然了。所以，一定説英雄的裝飾不該這樣漂亮的，那也未免太以皮相看人了。何况以舊小説做脚本的京戲便不如此，譬如有一次看「天霸拜山」，那一位飾黄天霸英雄的，前後的衣服便换了三次之多，而三次衣服又全是那麽簇新漂亮的，手裏並且還套着一個閃閃發光的金鋼鑽戒指，這樣一個儀表非凡的英雄，係能説不該打扮着這麽漂亮嗎？</p>
<p>所以，打扮得漂亮便不是英雄那樣的結論是未免太可笑的，而中國的國術並未失傳給證實，那却是使多少有心人雀躍三百的呀！</p>

<p>最苦痛的，還不是上面那些事；而情感和理智間的矛盾，才是使我最無法解除的。</p>
<p>常常地，爲了生活的逼迫，我想任性地幹一下卑汚的事，以求行物質的享受，和崇高的地位。再一想時，理智馬上擺出一副嚴正的臉，不客氣地責備起來。他敎我應該有一個謹嚴的生活，走着坦白的大途，從不斷的努力中去探求光明。</p>
<p>我的大部分的時間，可説是在理想的矛盾和行爲的矛盾，以及理想和行爲的矛盾中滑過去了。然而，至今我還不能肯定地解答這問題：</p>
<p>「人類是不是永遠生活在矛盾中的呢？」</p>

<p>— 冬冬</p>
<p>昨晚整夜不曾合過眼，或許是過於興奮吧。實在的，朋友！我得了你母親告訴我關於你的消息之後，我眞歡喜到不曉得要如何表現好。在你母親，那當然是跳過了獲得了寳貝的喜歡的；不過，她老人家又免不掉要淌下幾點眼淚的，頓時的歡悦，拘起了她已往的傷痕，而担心着你的堅强的個性，會不願接受她的苦勸，重復回歸家裏來的。我安慰她一會，在她委託之下，應允着今天來這兒找你。</p>
<p>在回家的路上，你的影子一刻也離不掉我的腦海，委實你那一次的出走，也未免太過硬心腸了呢。我倆是多年的老友，我很同情你的性格，你的隠藏在内心的傷心事；我覺得你的性格並非一般俗不可耐的人們所能洞悉的，但是我眞不解，你竟把我也和旁人一般的看待，這一點，無論如何，你是應該引爲過失，而加以自責的。何况你還抛棄了白髮的老母，稚小的弟妹呢。</p>
<p>在時晨鐘敲了六下的時候，我揉一揉疲憊的眼睛，撑起了困倦的肢體，用了冷水洗了一回臉，提起精神，趕赴開往Ｃ村的早班船。</p>
<p>到了Ｃ村，我急忙挽了一位粗壯的男子漢，訽問這兒的路綫，他伸長了指尖指示了半嚮，我祇是隨着他的聲音，唔唔唔地應着，其實我是模糊得很，右轉左轉的次數，弄得我不知要先從那條路走起。那位粗漢，大槪知我一時記不清了，這麽多的轉灣吧，最後他告訴我先從左邊一直走去，到了那雙叉路口，再問問路人。我照着他的指引，足足走了一個鐘頭，問過了好幾人，才到了你這間古色古香的寓所來。</p>
<p>事情是這麽地倒霉，凑巧你剛剛出門去。我詢問你的鄰居，她説你極罕到外面去，鎭天祇是坐在家裏，今天不曉得有什麽値得你出去走走的事情，驅使你，暫時抛撇了這間古屋。</p>
<p>在這兒，我已是等了差不多三個鐘頭了，我是不能再等了，我得趕回去，遲點，恐怕趕不上輪船，呌家裏的人掛心着。現在，寫了這麽多的話給你。是誠懇地希望你回家一行！</p>
<h3 id="c264">賭博與娱樂消遣 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>自從人類社會進化到使人類對於物質的亨受，有不滿足的時候，人類的慾望越大，他的僥倖心越强，因此想從窮困的境况當中，求得毫不費力地於最短期間發財，於是乎賭博求利成爲傳統觀念。尤其在這富益富貧益貧的現社會，賭博之風最盛。</p>
<p>考賭博在古時雖然不至於没有，但在戰國春秋時代，如從孔丘聖人對於賭博是行爲敎學生子勤習的課外工作這一史跡看來，古之人對於賭博是不想從那裏發財可知。（論語記：「子曰，飽食終日無所用心，不有博奕者乎，爲之尤賢夫巳。」孔丘聖人以爲終日賭博比較終日丢而郎當好得多。然而，現在就連下棋都有人用來望發發小財，眞是世風日下，不堪回首！</p>
<p>最是令人不解的是，凡是娱樂消遣的事件，如果不用金錢在裏頭起了輸赢的作用，人們就認爲没趣没勁兒的事，這豈不奇乎哉？四個老太婆打起麻將牌來！她們自然是認爲在娱樂消遣，可是如果有人聲明這是打打玩的，那她們便不願意坐攏了。難道説娱樂消遣與賭博是不能分開的嗎？這就令人越想越莫名其土地堂了。</p>
<p>外國人的賽馬，賽狗，回力球比賽在表面的意義上看來，分明是給觀衆娱樂消遣的遊戲；可是他們爲的是在賭博；一邊的人是設下這種遊戲坐收抽水的利益，當做生意經，另一邊的人是在買票賭博希望發發小洋財。外國人懂得社會人心的弱點，他們將娱樂消遣的事件都商品化，拿來做生意，這在我們中國的古聖賢是連想都想不到的事。</p>
<p>然而有設賭博求利的人，有下賭希望發財的人，其原因都是社會制度使人對於物質的享受不滿足的緣故；如果社會上没有賭博那一天，必定是那令人對於物質的享受已可滿足的社會制度到來了。</p>

<h3 id="e9">Legislative Yuan Passes Constitutional Draft on Articles Concerning the Executive Yuan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Council is chaired by the President</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Has 20 Ministers of State</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan met at 2:30 PM on the 5th to review the articles of the Executive Yuan in the second section of the constitutional draft. Article 55, "The Executive Yuan is the highest organ of the central government for exercising executive power," was passed unanimously. Article 56, "The Executive Yuan shall have one President and twenty Ministers of State, who shall be appointed and dismissed by the President," Tao Xuan said that the ministers of state are equivalent to the provincial government and do not serve as members of the department, so they are idle and have nothing to do or are not responsible. The word "minister of state" should be deleted, because we hope that there will be fewer high officials. Zhao Naichuan agreed with Tao's intention and added a supplement. Cheng Zhonghang and Chuan Bingchang expressed their opposition, saying that the role of the minister of state is to gather people with rich political experience and ask them to criticize the current administration. Even the members of the current provincial government who do not serve as heads of departments have many people who bury their heads in their work. This system cannot be considered bad because of one or two nominal members of the provincial government. Moreover, the 20 ministers of state, in addition to the heads of various ministries and commissions as ex officio members, the remaining six or seven people discuss national affairs together, advocate fairness, and coordinate the opinions of various departments, which is most important. Sun Ke also said that this system is very good. In the current various meetings, those with positions often do not speak, and the speakers are mostly those who do not hold concurrent positions. After Sun finished speaking, there was no objection in the whole hall, and it was passed according to the original plan. Article 57, "The Executive Yuan shall establish various ministries and commissions to take charge of national administrative functions." Luo Yunyan said that the commission system is still in the trial period and should not be stipulated in the constitution, so he advocated deleting the four characters "various commissions." Liu Guanxun agreed with Luo's intention, while Cheng Zhonghang and Chen Changheng advocated maintaining the original plan. As a result, it was still according to the original plan, and according to the proposal of Yang Gongda, the two characters "national" were deleted, and the second reading was amended and passed. Articles 58 and 59 were only slightly deleted and revised, and the second reading was amended and passed. Article 60, "The Executive Yuan shall establish an administrative council, which shall be composed of the President, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Ministers of State, with the President as the chairman. If the President is unable to attend for some reason, the President of the Executive Yuan shall be the chairman." Some members believed that the powers and duties of the President of the Executive Yuan and the President were not clearly divided, and they advocated adding modifications. Later, after Fu Bingchang and others explained, it was still according to the original plan, and the three characters "for some reason" and "able" were deleted, and the second reading was amended and passed. In Article 61, only the order of the articles of each paragraph was slightly changed, and the five characters "President of the Executive Yuan" were added to the sixth paragraph, and it was passed according to the original plan. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a regular meeting on the morning of the 5th to discuss ordinary cases. In the afternoon at 2:30, it continued to meet to review Chapter 4 of the constitutional draft, Section 2 of the Central Government, the Executive Yuan.

As a result, the second reading was amended and passed the following articles in Section 2, Executive Yuan. Article 55, "The Executive Yuan is the highest organ of the central government for exercising executive power." Article 56, "The Executive Yuan shall have one President and twenty Ministers of State, who shall be appointed and dismissed by the President." Article 57, "The Executive Yuan shall establish various ministries and commissions to take charge of administrative functions." Article 58, "The ministers of various ministries and the chairmen of various commissions of the Executive Yuan shall be appointed and dismissed by the President from among the Ministers of State." Article 59, "The President of the Executive Yuan, the Ministers of State, the ministers of various ministries, and the chairmen of various commissions shall be responsible to the President." Article 60, "The Executive Yuan shall establish an administrative council, which shall be composed of the President, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the Ministers of State, with the President as the chairman. If the President is unable to attend, the President of the Executive Yuan shall be the chairman." Article 61, the following matters shall be resolved by the administrative council: (1) legal bills and budget bills submitted to the Legislative Yuan; (2) martial law cases and amnesty cases submitted to the Legislative Yuan; (3) declarations of war cases, peace treaty cases, treaty cases, and other bills on important international matters submitted to the Legislative Yuan; (4) matters of common concern between various ministries and commissions; (5) various items submitted by the President for deliberation; (6) matters proposed by the President of the Executive Yuan, various Ministers of State, various ministries, and commissions. The meeting adjourned at 5:00. The meeting will continue at 9:00 AM on the 6th. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke wrote several issues on the Chinese constitution, which he plans to submit to various newspapers for publication on Double Ten Day. The content will detail the drafting and decision-making process of major issues such as the form of government, people's rights and freedoms, equalization of power, the boundary between political and governing powers, and the presidential system and cabinet system, which are of most concern to the people of the country, to inform the people of the country.

<p>Content of Japan-Germany Alliance as Reported by Japanese Newspapers</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi returned to Tokyo at 5:00 AM on the 5th from Kanazawa. During the meeting, he stated that the damage to the army from the recent Kansai storm was significant. The cost of reconstruction in rural areas is substantial, and the second national defense enhancement issue requires careful consideration for budget allocation. The army published a booklet on national defense issues, which has had a significant impact on various sectors. However, the current international situation is not yet out of an extraordinary phase. The entire nation should have sufficient awareness, and the education of thought and economic issues are closely related to military preparedness. It is an important issue to study from a national defense perspective. The military is considering plans for national mobilization, including economic and financial mobilization. Therefore, it plans to publish another booklet in the future to vigorously promote national awareness, etc. (5th Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>After Japan's diplomatic failure with Soviet Russia, it proceeded with a plan to ally with Germany. Duke Tokugawa, former Minister of the Army Araki, and Lieutenant General Matsushita, who visited German army and navy authorities this summer, conducted secret Japan-Germany alliance negotiations. By August, a secret agreement was established. The main points of its content are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Germany recognizes Japan's special interests in the area east of Lake Baikal to Siberia.</p>
<p>(2) Japan recognizes Germany's colonization plans in the Ukraine area.</p>
<p>(3) The two countries agree to provide mutual political and military assistance.</p>
<p>(4) The term of the agreement is five years.</p>
<p>Based on the secret agreement, the German side plans to send 500 aviation technicians to Japan within the next six months, ten of whom will depart for Japan soon. German naval and military chemical factories will also send technicians to Japan to assist in Japanese military technology. (China United Press)</p>

<p>Japanese Military Plan</p>
<p>The So-Called "Advocacy of National Defense and National Policy"</p>
<p>(China United Press Tokyo Dispatch) The Ministry of the Army published 160,000 copies of a booklet on October 1, entitled "The Essence of National Defense and the Advocacy of its Strengthening." The section on "Advocacy of National Defense and National Policy" is the military's longstanding advocacy. The following is a summary of its main points, which is sufficient to understand the military's policy:</p>
<p>Organization of National Defense: Future international conflicts can be described as competitions of intelligence against intelligence and organization against organization. Therefore, it can also be said that the trophy of victory will fall into the hands of those who have superior plans and organizers compared to their opponents. Therefore, national defense policy can be simply defined as follows: a policy that organizes and utilizes all national defense elements of a country for the purpose of national defense.</p>
<p>National Defense and Domestic Problems: (1) Stability of National Life: If only a portion of the people enjoy economic benefits, especially those obtained without labor, while the majority of the people are in dire straits, resulting in class conflict, if this fact exists, it is a problem that cannot be ignored from the perspective of general national policy or national defense policy. Therefore, it is hoped that all the people will abandon their selfish individualistic economic concepts, awaken and adopt a holistic economic concept, and move towards establishing an appropriate economic mechanism to realize the ideals of the imperial country. If there are people with conscience, regardless of scholars or entrepreneurs, and regardless of whether they are in or out of government, they must unite as a nation to study countermeasures and strive for their realization. Regarding national life, the biggest problem at present is to save the agricultural, mountain, and fishing villages. (2) Regeneration of Agricultural and Fishing Villages: The unfair and unstable prices of agricultural products, the imperfection of the production distribution system, the defects in agricultural management methods and the inappropriate use of surplus labor, tenant farmer issues, the excessive burden of public taxes and levies in rural areas and the increase in debt, the unaffordable price of fertilizers, the lack of smooth rural financing, the sharp drop in silkworm and silk prices, natural disasters such as droughts, floods, wind, snow, and insects, the short-sighted thinking of rural villagers and the lack of backbone figures, the limited arable land and the surplus population, the above-mentioned causes are intertwined and cause the current rural exhaustion. However, more than half of these causes can be attributed to the opposition between urban and rural areas. While social policy countermeasures are extremely necessary to save the impoverished rural areas, what is even more important is to take the overall concept of interdependence between rural and urban areas and the coexistence and co-prosperity of the people as the foundation, improve the economic mechanism, solve the population problem, and other fundamental countermeasures. It is hoped that the self-disciplined work ethic and creative power of the rural villages themselves will be strengthened and developed, and that they will restore vitality from the bottom up. (3) Organization of General Will and Invention: Rationalize, streamline, and economize the command and control departments and organizations to make them usable. Provide funds to encourage inventions, utilize research institutions, improve the patent system, and other facilities are necessary.</p>
<p>National Defense and Thought: Thought is the human element, i.e., the enrichment of mental and physical strength. Therefore, it must be cultivated by schools and social education institutions. At the same time, the defects of society must be corrected, the economic organization must be adjusted to stabilize national life, and the rural areas must be saved and revitalized to cultivate the people's strength.</p>
<p>(1) Promoting National Edification: To make the people have a deep understanding and firm belief in the ideals of the founding of the nation and the mission of the imperial country, and to make them unswervingly resist any unjust and excessive thoughts permeating the imperial country inside and outside, it is necessary to establish such a firm national concept and moral concept, cultivate the noble idea of sacrificing oneself for the country and the whole, eradicate individualism that ignores the country and shuns the control required by the country, extreme internationalism that violates the interests of the country, and egoism, cultivate a simple and resolute spirit, sweep away the decadent atmosphere, make the people understand the current situation of the world and the international situation, recognize Japan's position in the world, promote the unique culture of the nation, prevent the uncritical absorption of Western civilization, change the education system that overemphasizes intellectual education, emphasize moral education, and also focus on practical and realistic education, and also strive for the progress of physical education.</p>
<p>National Defense and Military Strength: The military equipment currently possessed by our country's army is sufficient to maintain the passive minimum limit of national defense. In the era after the Great War, when Russia's military equipment was weak, it was still sufficient to maintain the static purpose of peace in East Asia. However, now, due to the Manchurian Incident, the front line of national defense has been expanded, and it is necessary to maintain the security of an area three times larger than the imperial country. Therefore, from the perspective of passive national defense, the military equipment is still felt to be insufficient. However, because Soviet Russia is implementing a five-year plan, it already possesses the world's largest military equipment, and it is gradually enriching its military equipment in the Far East. The border between Russia and "Manchuria" is constantly experiencing disputes, and the many cases in the country and the recent obvious challenges and habitual untrustworthy behavior of Russia have made us not dare to predict how the future relationship between Japan and Russia will develop. Therefore, in order to prepare for the event of a change in the situation, it is necessary to have complete military strength and enriched equipment. This is the most important thing for dealing with the current situation. (1) The Urgent Need to Expand Air Force Strength and Civil Aviation: If we add up Russia's 3,000 aircraft, the United States' 3,000 aircraft, and China's 500 aircraft, the air force strength of the countries surrounding Japan exceeds 6,000 aircraft. Even if diplomatic strategies can limit the enemy country to one country, at a minimum, it is still necessary to anticipate an enemy air force strength of 3,000 aircraft. However, Japan only has about 1,000 aircraft of army aviation force. Can this still be called complete national defense?</p>
<p>Adjustment of National Defense and Economy: Although the current economic mechanism has made great contributions to the economic development of our country, from the point of view of the entire country, especially from the point of view of national defense, there is still room for improvement and adjustment as follows. Since the current economic mechanism is developed based on the basic principle of individualism, from another point of view, this kind of economic activity has a tendency to let individual interests flourish, so it cannot be consistent with the overall interests of the country and the people. As a result of intensified free competition, there is also the terror of creating the idea of suppressing others and the concept of class opposition. The polarization of wealth causes the poverty of the masses, unemployment, the decline of small and medium-sized industries and farmers, resulting in the instability of national life. The national control force of the current economic mechanism is small, so it is inconvenient to use it in a unified manner to mobilize all efforts for resource development, industrial revitalization, and trade promotion. Also, because the national budget is very limited, even the facilities that are absolutely necessary for national defense cannot be realized. Although there are various opinions on the reform plan of the current economic mechanism, from the point of view of national defense, the following can be listed: based on the ideal of building a country, establishing a country with a moral economic concept, to promote the development of the country and the well-being of all the people, promote the activities of all the people, so that each can respond to their labor income, to stabilize the lives of the masses, improve financial systems and industrial management, in order to develop resources as much as possible, revitalize industries, promote trade and enrich national defense facilities, within the scope of not violating the requirements of the country, enable individuals to satisfy their personal entrepreneurial and business desires, in order to further increase their hard work, sort out the tax system to seek the true achievement of fairness in taxation, the establishment of wartime economy, the enterprise encouragement of wartime uncertain resources, the storage of insufficient resources, the research of substitutes, the plan for obtaining overseas resources in wartime, ...... In peacetime, they must be used to promote the implementation of national defense industries and the export countermeasures of surplus products. Wartime financial and financial countermeasures, trade countermeasures, labor countermeasures, etc., must be extensively studied in peacetime to complete their preparation.</p>

<p>The United States Advocates Discussing Political Issues</p>
<p>Japan Threatens to Withdraw from the Conference at All Costs</p>
<p>(London) Judging from reports from Washington, the preliminary talks for the 1935 Naval Conference, scheduled for October this year, seem likely to expand in scope. People here are extremely interested in this matter, but it seems that the British government's views have not yet been decided. Officials believe that the procedures for the preliminary talks and the number of participants must be determined to a large extent by Japan's attitude. The problem to be clarified at present is whether the London Naval Treaty will be extended or whether a new treaty will be concluded. However, if Japan proposes to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty, the equal strength of the countries in the Far East will become a problem again, and the scope of the talks will be greatly expanded. Although any speculation at this time is too early, it is generally expected that if the countries propose to include issues other than purely naval issues on the agenda, the British government will not object. (4th Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Arms Reduction Conference Representative Davis and Chief of Naval Operations Stanley will go to London on October 10 to participate in the preliminary negotiations of the Naval Reduction Conference. At this time, senior officials of the U.S. government are clearly worried that the U.K. and Japan will jointly oppose the U.S. This concern stems from the news that Japan is preparing to demand a reduction in the total tonnage of battleships. In other words, it is difficult for the U.S. to continue to maintain 35,000-ton warships under the current naval treaty, while the U.K. and Japan can use this to build smaller and more numerous warships. If the U.S. wants to maintain 35,000-ton warships, it will have to reduce the number of warships. However, when the U.S. has an affair in the Pacific, it will not be effective if it does not maintain warships with a larger range of action. Therefore, Japan's plan to reduce the total tonnage of battleships will inevitably cause unanimous opposition from the U.S. It can be asserted that the U.S. would rather abandon the current naval treaty than accept this plan. In addition, it is heard that Japan also intends to advocate that all countries stop building auxiliary ships and limit themselves to the current number. This is also not what the U.S. wants to hear, as it can still build 115,000 tons under the current naval treaty. (4th Havas)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The U.S. arms reduction policy has gradually revealed its outline since Chief of Naval Operations Stanley came forward, expressing its opposition to Japan's claim to abolish the principle of ratio and maintaining its attitude of maintaining the current ratio. Since the fundamental opinions between Japan and the U.S. are incompatible, the future of the arms reduction preparatory meeting will inevitably break down. However, the British attitude towards this is a matter of great concern to the Japanese navy. Although the U.K. is dissatisfied with the Washington and London treaties, observing its domestic situation, the financial recovery is slowly progressing, and it is difficult to raise funds for shipbuilding after 1937. If negotiations fall apart, it will make the policy towards the U.S. and France more difficult. In order to avoid this situation, the British government is making every effort to consider a foolproof method to ensure the successful completion of the meeting. (5th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The U.S. delegation advocates expanding the agenda of the 1935 Naval Conference to discuss political issues. The U.K. also said that if Japan announces the abolition of the Washington Treaty, it is inevitable to raise political issues. The Japanese government has not fully understood the intentions of the British and American officials, but the previous preparatory meeting attended the meeting on the condition that political issues would not be discussed at all. Japan will not change its position in the future. Therefore, if the British and American claims are true, Japan has decided not to participate in the meeting. Also, if political issues are proposed in the middle of the meeting, it will immediately withdraw from the meeting. (5th Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>(Washington) Treasury officials told the Associated Press today that there has been no change in the U.S. silver purchasing policy in China recently and denied having purchased large quantities of silver from Chinese people. This statement was issued in response to rumors that the Treasury Department had purchased approximately five million ounces of silver from American banks in Shanghai and Tianjin. If it is shipped to London, it would be more profitable. This seems to contradict the U.S. Treasury's claim of having purchased silver in China. Some of the raw silver may be used for industrial purposes, and some of it may be shipped to New York for refining and then to London. Telecommunications from China also stated that if the Treasury Department's silver purchase in China has not stopped since the second Chinese silver note was issued, it must have decreased.

<h3 id="e27">German Trade Import Surplus <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Imports of American Goods are the Largest</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's foreign trade import surplus is the largest in terms of the amount to the United States. In the first six months of this year, the import surplus to the United States was 160,000,000 marks. Without the recently adopted import restriction measures, it would have increased to 350,000,000 marks. There are two reasons for the increase in the import of American goods to Germany: (1) The devaluation of the U.S. dollar, which has the same effect on the German export industry as the increase in U.S. import tariffs. (2) The increase in sales of Japanese goods in the U.S. market has crowded out German goods. (4th Havas)</p>

During this period of budget preparation and on the eve of the convening of the provisional parliament, the condition of Minister of Finance Fujii is of great concern to all parties. However, the so-called resignation due to illness is only speculation. Vice Minister of Finance Tsushima stated on the 5th that the Minister of Finance's illness is very mild and there is no fever. After resting this week, he will be able to go to the office next week. Not only is there no news of resignation, but there is no such intention. (5th Jiji Shokuho)</p>

<p>Madrid The establishment of Lerroux's new cabinet has already caused a serious upheaval in Spain. After the announcement of the new cabinet members, socialist trade unions throughout the country immediately declared a general strike in protest against the new cabinet's inclusion of three members of the Catholic Party. Trams and streetcars have now disappeared from the streets of the capital. Union leaders claim that all work will be suspended on Friday.

<p>Madrid - Due to the strike in the capital, things are inconvenient. The purpose of the strike is to remove the three Catholic Party members from the new cabinet. The Spanish Republic is currently facing its most serious crisis since its establishment. A state of martial law has been declared in the province of Asturias due to riots, but the cabinet hopes that the capital will not need to be declared under siege. So far, no major riots have occurred in the capital. Only a few trams occasionally run on the streets, each guarded by four soldiers. Besides milk stalls, some tobacco shops and food stores are still open. Crowds are gathering outside bakeries, preemptively stocking up in case of a strike. Shops have only been slightly affected today. Troops are stationed at administrative offices and important locations. The general strike order was issued before midnight, but the government had preemptively deployed troops to protect public places. Police ordered pedestrians on the streets to return home, and those who resisted were arrested. Several groups of strikers were forced by soldiers with rifles to stand against walls with their hands raised until cars arrived and took them away. Last night, during a search of a house, three people were shot dead, including one police officer. Today, police found a machine gun in a streetcar. A striker dressed in military uniform entered a camp trying to steal a machine gun but was discovered and arrested. Police also found a machine gun at the entrance to a large camp under control. All businesses in Barcelona have ceased operations, and the overall situation is very serious. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid - The new Lerroux cabinet had just been formed when the general strike began at midnight. This morning, bakers stopped working, and cafe waiters, rental car and streetcar drivers all left their posts. A bloody tragedy occurred in the Puerta del Sol district. Rioters were secretly meeting somewhere when police raided them, seizing 14 submachine guns and many pistols. Both sides opened fire, resulting in the death of one assault guard and one striker, with seven injured and 200 arrested. Militias exchanged fire with strikers on the streets, and extremists attacked a barracks, which was repelled by soldiers, resulting in one death. Rumors circulated that the authorities would soon issue a state of martial law. Nationwide inspections have been implemented. Printers have left their factories. Only two or three right-wing newspapers published as usual this morning. Several cabinet members are currently meeting to exchange ideas. The new Minister of Interior, Valgallo, claimed that he was quite optimistic and that the government had taken all measures to quell the incident. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>State of Martial Law Declared in Asturias Province</p>
<p>Madrid - Today, the red revolution has plunged the province of Asturias into open civil war. Turmoil elsewhere is also worsening the situation. An official announcement this afternoon stated that 12 people have died and 16 seriously injured in the fighting in Asturias. The government is currently trying its best to cope with the incident. Casualties are expected to continue to rise. Martial law has been declared in Asturias, and the government's suppression efforts are currently limited to that province. (National dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid - Only the province of Asturias has declared martial law after the outbreak of the general strike. According to private sources in Oviedo, Asturias, the general strike in the mining area is clearly revolutionary in nature. Work in the mining area has completely stopped, and railway vehicles have ceased operation. Authorities in Oviedo are guarding the city with machine guns. Troops and even aircraft are being transferred from Alto de los Godos to Oviedo to suppress the unrest. The governor has ordered shops to open. Rebels reportedly attacked the militia barracks in Lugana, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The militia barracks have been burned down. Large groups of armed striking workers exchanged fire with militia assault vehicles. All barracks in the mining area have reportedly been attacked by workers. Rebels are carrying weapons and wearing red armbands. Due to their large numbers, militia assault vehicles could not hold out and have been forced to retreat. However, these private reports should be taken with a grain of salt, as communication between the capital and Oviedo is blocked, and it is currently impossible to obtain reliable information.

He also said that he would report to the public via radio every two hours from now on. Catalonia has completely gone on strike. The city of Sabadell has been controlled by syndicalists and left-wing Catalan youth, who are maintaining order in the city with weapons. Many cars have been confiscated, with the words "Emblem of the Revolutionary Army" written on them. The parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia is scheduled to meet this afternoon, which is attracting widespread attention.

<h3 id="e36">The Opium Policy Under the Rule of Pseudo-Organizations by Jing <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Opium is planted in the four northeastern provinces. There are eighteen counties in Jilin, the Hingan Special District, and various places in Rehe Province. In Liaoning, there are several counties such as Changbai and Linjiang. The total cultivated area is over 65,000 hectares, and the harvest will exceed 1 million dan. Our country has suffered from opium for a long time. Since the Opium War, the import of foreign poisons has not been stopped. We are currently seeking methods of prohibition internationally. However, the puppet Manchukuo is planting opium on such a large scale not only to increase its income but also to harm China and plunge our nation into a state of no return.</p>
<p>The people of our country have gradually become aware, and many are voluntarily quitting opium. This is because personal economies are feeling increasingly depleted, and the stimulation of opium ultimately cannot match the depth of modern civilization. However, in our northern provinces, general life is simple, and there is almost no entertainment for the people. Therefore, they take advantage of this weakness to turn opium into morphine. Initially, it is sold very cheaply and is especially easy to consume. Therefore, "white powder" is very popular in Hebei, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Henan provinces. The depth of the poisoning and the severity of the harm far exceed that of opium because opium is easier to quit. Once addicted to "white powder," it penetrates deep into the marrow and cannot be saved. After forcibly seizing our four northeastern provinces, they also know that the people of our area are unwilling to submit. The nature of our country's farmers, though inevitably accustomed to conservatism, has the special characteristic of enduring hardship and bearing heavy burdens. The Japanese deeply fear that our people will use this point to resist persistently. Therefore, after seizing the four provinces, they first opened up the opium ban, allowing general middle and lower-class members of society to consume it freely. At the same time, they set up various temptations in order to eliminate the activities of our country's people. In other words, it is to eliminate the resistance of our nation.</p>
<p>Does one not see Taiwan after being ruled by the Japanese? The reason why its people's resistance is limited to only appeals is due to the small land and sparse population, abundant local products, and people being content with the status quo. However, the anesthesia of opium, which causes local young people with potential to revolve in the smoke of cigarettes and extinguish their courage to move forward, is also a powerful factor. Recently, the large-scale planting of poppies in the Northeast is not only intended to poison the people of the four provinces. One will soon see them transported into the customs, leaving no clean land in Hebei and Shandong provinces, or even spreading to the markets of the Yangtze River basin. The strength of the former Indian earth merchants will serve as a model. This matter is a great disaster for the people of our country and a worry about leaving poison to future generations. Therefore, we should make the greatest determination for the future of the nation and the survival of the country and quickly implement the eradication of opium. We should pay special attention to the source of the four northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>The government is currently strictly prohibiting opium and repeatedly ordering people to quit on schedule. If it can persevere, the source of opium can be expected to gradually be cut off. However, this kind of opium disaster has been caused for a long time, and the source of the poison is deep. Relying only on the prohibition of laws may still not be enough to achieve absolute results. Therefore, moral self-control is also sufficient to supplement the shortcomings of the laws. Social power originates from the people. If various groups can persuade in many ways, first make those who have jobs quit opium to awaken the self-awareness of each individual, then those who are addicted will inevitably imitate and quit, and those who have not been addicted will never be stained. If we can refuse ourselves first, then even if people set traps in every way to harm our nation, what good will it do?</p>

<p>Barthou's Meeting and Discussion Results</p>
<p>Rescheduled Rome Trip Date</p>
<p>(Paris) - Political circles now acknowledge that Foreign Minister Barthou postponed his trip to Rome because he wanted to talk to King Alexander of Yugoslavia. The King of Yugoslavia departed from Belgrade last night and will arrive in Paris tomorrow. The King of Yugoslavia is traveling on the torpedo destroyer Dubrovnik along the Dalmatian coast. En route he will visit the island of Korcula. The French Mediterranean Fleet will escort him to Marseille. Paris regards the King of Yugoslavia's visit as a very important event, and its outcome will have a significant impact on Foreign Minister Barthou's future meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (National dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - The date of Foreign Minister Barthou's trip to Rome to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is currently undetermined, but it is said that Barthou will not be able to go before All Saints' Day (i.e., November 1st). King Alexander of Yugoslavia is scheduled to visit France on the 9th of this month, and Barthou will definitely wait for him to come so that he can have the results of his talks with the King of Yugoslavia in preparation for his meeting with Mussolini. (Havas dispatch, 4th) - The capital of Yugoslavia - King Alexander and Queen Marie recently left here for the port of Zelenika in Dalmatia, from where they will travel by cruiser to France. Foreign Minister Yevtic is also traveling with them. According to Yevtic, speaking to a Havas reporter, the King's trip is a clear expression of Yugoslavia's feelings and sincerity towards France, and is enough to show that the friendship between the two countries is an unbreakable chain. He also said that after the King's visit to the Serbian capital, this trip further proves that France and Yugoslavia are cooperating in a harmonious way to solve the problems of consolidating peace and guaranteeing the interests of both countries. (National dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - London newspapers report that French Foreign Minister Barthou's trip to Rome has been postponed, but this has not yet been officially confirmed here. However, according to reports from Rome, the news from London does not seem to be entirely unfounded. Political circles here also say that Barthou's postponement of his trip to Italy is probably due to the fact that the initial negotiations with the Italian side have not yet yielded satisfactory results. Therefore, Barthou believes that the time for a personal trip to Rome to negotiate directly with Mussolini is not yet ripe. Another thing to note is that the various conveniences that the French Foreign Ministry had planned to give to the Italian people in the Tunisian colony have now been objected to by the Ministry of Colonies, so the progress of the Foreign Ministry's negotiations has been hampered. In addition, Foreign Minister Barthou is not willing to rush to mediate the dispute between Italy and Yugoslavia. (National dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Said the Move Aims to Avoid Dictatorship</p>
<p>Foreign Policy Based on Peace</p>
<p>Hopes for People's Sincere Unity</p>
<p>(Paris) - Tonight, Prime Minister Doumergue gave his sixth broadcast speech explaining his plan to reform the constitution. He said that this kind of reform is to avoid the dictatorship of one or a few people, because the evolution from disorder to anarchy and ultimately to dictatorship is inevitable. The Prime Minister went on to say that he wanted to select officials in major institutions to be subordinate to the Prime Minister's Office. In this way, the Prime Minister can easily understand the affairs of the major departments and easily achieve the effect of full administrative cooperation. In addition to the General Secretariat, the Prime Minister's Office also has the Higher Committee of National Defense and the National Economic Council attached to it. The members of the National Economic Council are appointed by the government, and their authority is to provide advice to the government. Economic Committee sub-branches are also set up in various places to make their tasks easier to carry out. The Prime Minister went on to say that he wanted to completely separate political and judicial institutions and had already drafted a plan that would be submitted to Congress for discussion. Doumergue then described one by one the results that the government had achieved in various aspects, saying that they had been very effective. Doumergue said that in terms of foreign policy, the policy that the French government is determined to implement is to maintain peace to the greatest possible extent. France itself is actively promoting peace, and France is sincerely cooperating with all countries that have the same goal of peace. Finally, Doumergue criticized the unified front of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, saying that its outcome would inevitably lead to dictatorship. This passage was very long. Doumergue concluded by urging the French people to unite sincerely, eliminate party prejudices, and said that since the constitutional reform plan has been determined, he will not be able to make any changes. He is quite confident that this reform proposal will be passed. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(London) - At the Conservative Party Conference in Bristol today, Sir Croft spoke out against the government's Indian policy and proposed a resolution expressing his political views, believing that the union between Great Britain and India in the central government of the Indian Empire cannot be dissolved and urging the government not to approve any recommendations that could endanger the future of India in the Empire. The motion was then amended by a vote of 543 to 520. The amendment stated that for the benefit of the party, the conference should not pass any resolutions, especially because it had previously been decided that a special meeting of the party committee would be held when the report of the Joint Select Committee was published to consult with Baldwin. The previous meeting was very turbulent, with some making contemptuous noises, some making catcalls, and some cheering. The amendment was put to a show of hands.

<p>(Tianjin) - Three Japanese men, Taniguchi Isamu, Uematsu Karo, and Fujie Neno, were seeking employment in Beiping and studying Chinese at a fellow students association. Because they had not been employed for a long time, they had a whimsical idea and plotted to defraud a large sum of money from Chinese officials. The matter was discovered and the three were arrested by the Japanese military police. The three went to the headquarters of the Chinese military police in Beiping at the end of August, claiming that they had worked in the staff department of the Japanese military police headquarters in Changchun, but because the actions of Japanese officials and Manchurian officials were unreasonable, they decided to work hard for China and abandoned their posts to come to Beiping, requesting the Chinese Ministry of Finance to issue 100,000 yuan to implement their plan. Because their attitude was suspicious, the Chinese military police reported to the Beiping Military Branch and investigated the actions of the three men at the same time. Before long, the Japanese military police also learned of the matter and secretly investigated the actions of the three men. At the end of September, the military branch notified the military attache Shibayama of the details. The Japanese military police were ordered to arrest the three men and hand them over to the police of the embassy. The Japanese authorities ordered the three men to be expelled from Beiping because they had not committed a crime, but their actions were not cautious. (Japanese Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At Wangjia Inn in Xifengdengwu Town, Tangshan, on the evening of the second, thirty-odd plainclothes strong men suddenly appeared, each equipped with a box cannon and carrying two large leather suitcases of bullets. They claimed to be a certain unit of the pseudo-Manchukuo army and had recruitment banners. On the third, they sent out two men to recruit along the streets. Three people, unaware of the situation, joined them. The town's self-defense corps sensed something was amiss and reported it to the county government, which dispatched thirty members of the San Nü'er River Self-Defense Corps to assist. On the morning of the fourth, the two self-defense corps surrounded Wangjia Inn. The bandits attempted to resist but were unsuccessful and were captured in their entirety. After being sent to the county, due to the involvement of a certain country, fearing it would stir up trouble, they were all expelled from the country. The pseudo-unit has fled towards Yutian Yahong Bridge. The provincial authorities, regarding the security of the Kailuan Five Mines, have decided to send personnel to investigate and reorganize.

<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Minister of Justice Shi Zhiquan stated that this inspection of Hubei's judiciary included Wuhan, Yichang, Shashi, and more than ten other locations. Due to official duties requiring attention, he returned to the capital first, while Shen Jiayi continued the inspection. The cases inspected in various counties showed few backlogs. Except for Wuhan and other places, the number of cases accepted was very small, with criminal cases exceeding civil cases, which is a natural result of economic decline and people's hardship. As for prisons and detention centers, only those in Wuhan and Yichang are modern, while the rest are old prisons and desperately need to be improved. Shi further stated that the Ministry's transfer to the Judicial Yuan could happen at any time. Since Luo Wengan has resigned, he is still responsible for reviewing important documents until someone takes over. He and Zheng Tianxi also feel that their abilities are limited and the responsibility is heavy, and they have not achieved much, so they have also requested to resign.

<h3 id="e78">On the Eve of the Beiping Administrative Reorganization Conference <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Various Committee Members Arrive in Beiping One After Another to Attend the Meeting</p>
<p>The List of Members of the War Zone Reorganization Committee Has Not Yet Been Finalized</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Fifth Conference of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Administrative Reorganization Committee is scheduled to be held tomorrow (the sixth). The administrative authorities of the five provinces and two municipalities, such as Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu and Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan, have arrived in Beiping one after another. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie is expected to arrive in Beiping at 8:19 AM this morning (the fifth). Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi is scheduled to arrive at Xizhimen Station at 8:00 AM this morning (the fifth). Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong originally intended to come to Beiping earlier, but was delayed due to the Gongyue Incident, negotiating with the Japanese in Tianjin. As of 1:00 PM today (the fifth), the 51st Army's office in Beiping has not yet received Yu's departure time. It is speculated that he will come to Beiping tonight (the fifth), which will not delay the meeting on tomorrow (the sixth). Shanxi Provincial Chairman Xu Yongchang may send a representative to attend if he cannot make it in time. Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang has prepared to attend as scheduled. Other committee members such as Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Zuomin, Jiang Menglin, Tang Erhe, Wang Shuhan, Zhang Boling, Qin Dechun, Wang Kemin, and He Qigong are expected to attend and participate, totaling about a dozen people.</p>
<p>The biggest goal of this conference is to build up morale. When Chairman Huang (Fu) took office last year at a time of crisis in the North, he declared that he had come to jump into a fire pit, working hard to stabilize morale. That work has now been completed. In order to further stabilize the North, Huang believes that it will be impossible to succeed without building up morale. Therefore, this meeting will have a thorough discussion on this point. The second goal is the war zone reorganization issue and the renewal of northern politics. Regarding war zone reorganization, namely the procedures for the establishment of the War Zone Reorganization Committee, the draft organizational law of the committee has been jointly drafted by Tong, Li Zeyi, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others over the past half month, and was completed as of yesterday (the fourth). It can be submitted for discussion and passed at the conference tomorrow (the sixth), and the date of its establishment will be decided. After the establishment of the committee, it will be fully responsible for all post-war events in the war zone and will liaise with the Japanese to ensure their completion. As for the list of committee members, as far as this reporter knows, although it has been internally determined, before it is officially announced, any rumors can only be regarded as speculation and cannot be regarded as a fixed list. The renewal of northern politics is an inherent authority of the Administrative Reorganization Committee itself, and there is no doubt about it. Moreover, at a time when national crisis is on the rise, if we want to have diplomatic solutions and strength, the starting point is to improve politics. Therefore, Chairman Huang (Fu) has returned to the North this time with the greatest determination, working hard in this direction. Regarding the training of civil servants and the investigation of the political situation and public opinion of the five provinces and two municipalities under his jurisdiction, Huang intends to present his opinions at this meeting and discuss a method for promoting them.</p>
<p>The agenda for tomorrow's (the sixth) meeting was set by the committee's First Section yesterday (the fourth), and will be distributed to the attending committee members today (the fifth). Although there was a proposal to extend the meeting by one day, it has not been considered a concrete decision. However, there are too many reporting items, and a decision will be made based on the length of time available. Chairman Huang (Fu) decided to hold a banquet at the Diplomatic Building at 7:00 PM tonight (the fifth) to welcome the assembled committee members, during which the committee members will exchange views on tomorrow's (the sixth) meeting.

<p>Rubber: London The London rubber market was calm this morning. At noon, the transaction price for the January-March term was 7 pence 0625, down .125.</p>
<p>New York Rubber opened lower by 8 to 12 points due to the movement in the London market, and then rebounded slightly. However, the market price fell by 7 to 11 points due to large-scale liquidation by various parties. Most were forward contracts.</p>
<p>Securities: New York The factors favoring the market before the opening of the New York securities market were (1) the securities market showed good resistance to retail liquidation, and (2) the strength of government bonds, which is now making sentiment firmer. The factors unfavorable to the market were (1) the lack of strong signs of trade recovery, which is disappointing, and (2) the panic selling of various stocks in California due to the political situation in that state, causing unrest. However, it is believed that this type of movement is now gradually subsiding. The securities market opened steadily this morning. Yesterday's upward trend still exists. Various quotations rose, at most by 1 point. The upward trend seems to be unfolding slightly, but there are no exciting developments elsewhere, so it is expected that the previous prices may not be able to continue to rise. Judging from today's atmosphere, the authorities' policy is turning towards stability and firmness. It is heard that the Reconstruction Administration is now considering abolishing the Blue Eagle and fixed price methods. The market prices of various New York securities are as follows:</p>

<p>Engaged in Several Hand-to-Hand Battles, Occupying More Than Twenty Bandit Forts in a Row</p>
<p>The Pseudo-21st Division Launches a Full-Scale Counterattack but All Fail</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: According to military sources, Liang's troops of the XX Division were the most forward line among the Sixth Route Army troops when they occupied Dajiaokeng Xiongling last time. According to recent reports, the bandits, seeing that the troops' advance was difficult to stop, dispatched the pseudo-21st Division to confront them. At dawn on the 28th of last month, Liang's troops began attacking Taipingshan Shijingkeng, more than ten miles south of Xiongling. The pseudo-21st Division defended tenaciously, relying on the dangerous terrain. After four hours of fierce fighting, our officers and soldiers became braver and more vigorous, launching fierce charges. The bandits were horrified and collapsed, falling off cliffs and into ravines, trampling on each other. Liang's troops captured more than twenty bandit forts in one go, completely occupying Taipingshan Shijingkeng. Afterwards, the bandit army, thinking that our army was either exhausted or negligent in defense after a great victory, launched a full-scale counterattack. Little did they know that Liang's troops had surplus courage and were very vigilant. They waited for them to pounce, calmly responding to the battle. After several hand-to-hand combats, the bandits were unsuccessful and fled in disarray, abandoning their armor and weapons. It is estimated that 300 to 400 bandits were killed in this battle, more than 30 bandits were captured, and one light machine gun, more than 30 rifles, two Mauser pistols, and a red flag were captured.

<h3 id="e82">Relief for Peasant Households in Recovered Bandit Areas of Jiangxi <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Forty-One Counties and Five Special Districts</p>
<p>Fifteen Yuan in Loans Proposed for Each Household</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Rural Cooperative Committee is investigating the disaster situation in this province. The most severely affected areas include forty-one counties and five special districts. Based on the investigation results, a proposed estimate of the number of peasant households to be relieved and the amount of agricultural loans has been drafted. The estimate lists a total of 292,000 peasant households in need of relief, with a proposed minimum loan amount totaling 1.5 million yuan (the table is omitted). The explanation of the table is as follows: (1) The counties and districts listed in this table are those that have been ravaged by bandits for a long time, have suffered heavy losses, and are in urgent need of relief. (2) The total original population of each county is based on the figures obtained from the Ministry of Interior Affairs in the 17th year of the Republic [1928] and the Department of Civil Affairs in the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. (3) The columns for the estimated number of people needing relief and the estimated number of peasant households needing relief are based on the general figures obtained from the investigation of counties where the committee dispatched instructors to handle rural relief, and with careful estimates referencing the disaster reports of the Department of Public Security of the Department of Civil Affairs and other agencies over the years. However, the special districts are newly established by dividing existing counties, and their population cannot be investigated. Moreover, they have not been completely cleared of bandits, making on-site investigation even more difficult. Therefore, the population and number of households have not been reported. (4) The column for the amount of farmer loans calculated at fifteen yuan per household is based on the costs of cattle, farm tools, seeds, and food during the farming season, excluding land and housing. Each farm household, averaging four to five people, cultivates an average of ten mu [approximately 1.65 acres] of land. The capital required is at least as follows: half a head of cattle (i.e., two households share one head) costs about eighteen yuan, farm tools cost about fifteen yuan, seeds cost about three yuan, and four months of food and oil during the seeding period cost about twenty-four yuan. According to the above table, the total cost is sixty yuan. If it is assumed that four households share one head of cattle, and most of the farm tools can be saved, only four or five yuan need to be added. Half of the living expenses during the farming season can be earned through day labor or rough handicrafts, which requires another thirty yuan. Now, if we calculate an average supplement of half, then at least fifteen yuan is indispensable. Therefore, it is calculated at fifteen yuan. (5) The columns for the proposed grades and proposed minimum amounts are because the number of households needing relief in each county is by no means uniform. It is proposed to simplify the complex by using a progressive series, dividing them into eight grades, and the loan amounts are also progressively calculated into eight levels. Those with 1,500 to 2,500 households needing relief are classified as Grade Xin, 2,500 to 4,000 households as Grade Geng, 4,000 to 6,000 households as Grade Ji, 6,000 to 8,500 households as Grade Wu, 8,500 to 11,500 households as Grade Ding, 11,500 to 15,000 households as Grade Bing, 15,000 to 19,000 households as Grade Yi, and 19,000 to 23,500 households as Grade Jia. The proposed loan amounts are also calculated progressively according to the number of households. Those listed in Grade Xin receive a loan of 20,000 yuan, Grade Geng 25,000 yuan, Grade Ji 30,000 yuan, Grade Wu 35,000 yuan, Grade Ding 45,000 yuan, Grade Bing 60,000 yuan, Grade Yi 80,000 yuan, and Grade Jia 105,000 yuan. As for the special districts, all of which are newly established by dividing various counties, there is no independent population survey number. The number of peasant households needing relief and the grade of loan to be listed are not estimated. However, the jurisdictions are not very large, so it is temporarily assumed that they are at Grade Xin and the required farmer loan amount is estimated. Those originally belonging to a certain county that are incorporated will still be proportionately transferred from the total loan amount listed in the original county. Those originally belonging to a county that does not handle rural relief and has not listed any loan amounts will be separately determined to make up for it. For example, half of the jurisdiction of Cihua and Zhaoqiao Districts originally belonged to a county that did not list any loan amounts, so each is separately listed with a loan of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yangtze River National Products Tour (III) (Heng) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Arrived in Jiujiang on September 15th and stayed for one night. Then, took the Nanxun Road to Nanchang. The Nanxun Road was a notorious corrupt railway in the past. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was stationed in Nanchang, officials and dignitaries have traveled frequently, making transportation extremely important. Therefore, after the efforts of the Ministry of Railways, a express train runs every morning, and everyone must buy a full ticket. This order can be strictly followed, so the order is well-maintained. A slow train runs once in the afternoon, which is more crowded. When the train arrives at Niuhang Station, cross the Gan River to the distant provincial capital. The Railway Bureau is currently planning to build a river bridge, contracted by Shanghai Fook Kee Construction Company, which is expected to be completed in May next year. Then, travelers will have much more convenience. The first problem encountered by our group upon entering Jiangxi Province was the issue of exemption from donations. It is stipulated that all kinds of goods imported from Jiangxi are subject to the Bandit Suppression Rehabilitation Donation, with silk and satin subject to a donation of up to 10% of the price. The exhibits brought by our group are purely promotional in nature and are clearly different from general business. However, it must be resolved before the meeting. We requested the provincial authorities to exempt this donation in order to promote national products. Therefore, after arriving in Nanchang, we visited Cheng Baiyong, the Director of the Education Department, and had a very pleasant conversation. We learned that education in Jiangxi is now being handled smoothly. Cheng is an educator who has worked hard and struggled. He is simple and quiet in his life. Wherever he serves as an official, the education community is attracted to him. He was introduced to meet Gong Boxun, the Director of the Construction Department, and agreed to continue the discussion at the Municipal Committee at 8 o'clock the next morning. Yan [Gong] also serves as the chairman of the Municipal Committee, and the committee is actually a miniature version of the municipal government. The next morning, we arrived on time with a written statement and were assigned Xia, the section chief of the Second Division, to forward the document to the provincial government, requesting approval for exemption from donations. Huang, the section head, was also sent to visit Liu, the Secretary-General of the provincial government. As a result of the earnest discussion, we were granted permission to promote the products. The decline of China's silk industry is considered a serious problem by people across the country. Having obtained the approval of Chairman Xiong, the Bandit Suppression Rehabilitation Donation Bureau was designated to verify and release the goods. This shows the sincerity of the Jiangxi provincial authorities in maintaining national products, which is truly commendable. If the request for exemption from donations had followed the normal procedures, it would not have been completed in ten days. Now, it was handled quickly in just two days, which is even more pleasing. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Xiong, the various agencies in Nanchang are constantly seeking a way out in hardship. They start working at 8 a.m., which is full of vigor. Huang Guangsheng, the director of the Public Security Bureau, is an old friend from Shanghai. He said that after arriving in Jiangxi for three years, he must return home at 8 or 9 p.m. every night, which shows the intensity of the work. The Nanchang police are very amiable and approachable. On the morning of the September 18th National Humiliation Day, at 11 a.m., they ordered the people of the city to stop working for three minutes to express their grief. At that time, I happened to be walking on the road and stopped to remain silent. I saw that the police were able to responsibly train the people. This method is more effective than posting slogans and shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Our group held a meeting in Nanchang, using the YMCA as the venue. More than 100 people attended, including administrative officials, representatives of the party headquarters, and guests from various agencies. The meeting lasted for five days, and the number of visitors reached more than 30,000. Many military and government officials visited. The government stipulates that during commemorative weeks, officials must wear blue robes and black jackets. Purchasers are often troubled by distinguishing whether they are national products. Now, seeing the beautiful silk blue robes and black jackets on display by the Meya Silk Company, they are all welcome and have become a common need among people in the agencies. The Nanchang National Products Promotion Association is the center of the Nanchang National Products Movement, gathering people from all walks of life into one place. They have done a lot of work to promote national products. The Nanchang Women's Association is also working hard to promote national products and is very concerned about the Shanghai Women's National Products Year Movement. The five words "Women's National Products Year" have a deep impression in the Nanchang women's community.</p>
<p>Nanchang is a famous city in Jiangxi. According to a survey by the Public Security Bureau in the 12th year of the Republic [1923], the city's population is 274,203. It controls the hub of the Gan River and uses the Nanxun Railway as an export line. Since the 16th year of the Republic [1927], it has become a military and political center. The market has prospered accordingly. In recent years, bandits and communists have infested various counties, and the wealth of the entire province has been concentrated in the provincial capital. The number of military and political personnel and consumers has increased significantly, and commerce has flourished. What is particularly satisfying is that there are very few inferior goods. For example, piece goods, which have the largest sales volume, have almost completely become a national product market, which is really rare. In terms of commodity sales, Meya silk and satin have long had a place in Nanchang. The fabrics of Hongxin Factory, the twill and drill of the Meiheng Textile Factory, the Ink Chrysanthemum brand socks of the China First Knitting Factory, the Five Harmony Goose brand health shirts, the enamelware of the China Enamel Factory, and the felt hats of the Huafu Factory are all selling well, adding color to the Shanghai national products industry. The banking industry is also showing a rising trend. The Bank of China was established the earliest. In addition, the Central, Shanghai National Products, and other banks have branches, and their business is very developed. Recently, the Jiaotong Bank and the Continental Bank are also planning to set up branches, which shows that the status of Nanchang has been determined by the Chinese financial community.</p>

<p>The China Bank and Jiaotong Bank have been established in Changshu for nearly ten years, and their business has been extraordinarily developed. The two banks hold the power of the entire city's financial community. The Daonan Company built a new market in the city the year before last, purchasing the entire site of the old county government. In order to develop its business, Jiaotong Bank first purchased land from Daonan Company to build a new building, which began construction in May of last year. At the same time, the China Bank also purchased more than one mu [approximately 0.16 acres] of land opposite it and started construction at the same time. Now, the new buildings of both banks have been completed and stand tall, facing each other in the new Daonan Market. They have now been inspected and accepted separately. Jiaotong Bank has also scheduled the opening ceremony for the 11th of this month and will move into the new business premises. China Bank will move in during the last ten days of this month due to temporary delays. It is also reported that Zhang Gongquan of the Shanghai Head Office will come to Changshu to attend the ceremony. Following the example of the China and Jiaotong Banks, Jincheng Bank, Shiye Bank, and Tongyi Bank have also purchased land to build buildings. In the future, the Daonan New Market area will be like the Bund of Shanghai.</p>

<p>This year's prolonged drought has caused a disaster, which has greatly affected the autumn harvest. In order to provide relief in case of emergency, the local authorities have organized an Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee to investigate the situation in various townships and establish agricultural warehouses, hoping that the villagers can have a place to obtain loans. Currently, in addition to the Farmers' Bank, which has established many branches in Dongtang City, Meili, Zhitang, Baimao, and other places, the County Management Committee is also setting up new warehouses based on the reports from various townships. However, the number of townships applying for additional warehouses is very large, and it is difficult to cope with due to limited funds. Based on actual observation, Hexing Town in Shazhou City and Liantang Town in the Third District are indeed necessary to establish. On the 4th of this month, the committee decided to first set up two places, and will continue to add more successively, and follow the provincial order to establish them within this month, so that farmers can store and mortgage goods.</p>

<p>Zhang Jiabing, a famous throat doctor in Yuantong Road, Guangfu Gate, has a secret recipe. Even the most dangerous throat diseases can be cured by Zhang's treatment, so his business is excellent. In recent days, Zhang was preparing medicinal materials to make swelling-reducing pearl yellow powder, throat-protecting pearl yellow powder, and flesh-regenerating powder, etc. He used a huge grinding vat behind the clinic and had been grinding for two days. At 7:30 p.m. the night before, Zhang and his son Xijun and others were sitting around the dinner table, while the coachman A'er was grinding the medicinal materials. Suddenly, there was a loud bang in the grinding vat, and it exploded instantly, injuring A'er's eyes. The vest and trousers he was wearing were all burned. His flesh was a bloody mess and he was severely injured. The objects in the room and the glass in the windows were completely shattered. The grinding pestle and grinding vat were smashed to pieces and flew several feet away. Zhang's daughter-in-law Xiang Shi and Sun Lin Sheng were slightly injured. After the incident, the injured were rushed to the hospital for treatment, and the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau also sent police to the scene to investigate and summoned Zhang Jiabing to the bureau for questioning. However, the cause of the explosion is still unknown.</p>

<p>Tu Xiaolai and Xu Peihuang came to Wuxi a few days ago to discuss the solicitation of shares with Director Yan and other preparatory directors and promoters. Then, they went to Chu to inspect the Wuxi-Chu section of the project. Regarding the issue of share solicitation, the county government has scheduled a meeting with local people in the next few days to coordinate and jointly solicit donations. The Chamber of Commerce also believes that this road starts from Wuxi, passes through Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, Nanxiang, Zhenru, and reaches Baoshan, with a total length of 140 kilometers. All the areas it passes through are rich areas south of the Yangtze River. It was previously ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to solicit merchants to undertake the project, and it has been approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government to sign an exclusive contract for passenger and freight transport for a period of 30 years. Compared with other investment projects, it has full guarantees. Yesterday, it has been announced to all industries to actively subscribe for shares.</p>
<h3 id="e91">County Committee Surveys Wasteland in the Rain <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The disaster situation in the fields of each district of this county is different. The high fields have neither been transplanted with rice seedlings in time nor planted with drought-resistant crops, so there is no harvest at all. The flat and low fields have been transplanted with rice seedlings relying on human and mechanical power to pump water. However, during the rice heading stage, they were subjected to the white dew rain and insect damage, resulting in most of the rice heading but not bearing fruit, which has not been seen in decades. The harvest has been greatly reduced. The county government, in view of this, has followed the autumn survey method of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, taking the overall reduction of the county as the principle. Those that are completely wasteland can be reported in a special register for exemption. However, according to the reports from various districts, the disaster area is more than 300,000 mu [approximately 49,500 acres], accounting for 75% of the total acreage. But according to the actual situation, the disaster area in the county should be more than 500,000 mu [approximately 82,500 acres], accounting for two-fifths of the total acreage. However, farmers who report wasteland must go through the district grain clerks, and the district grain clerks, with their bad habits difficult to change, extort and demand a reporting fee of five or six jiao per mu. Therefore, some villagers are unwilling to report wasteland. Recently, the rain has been continuous, and the wasteland survey committee of this county has set off in the rain to investigate the villages. As of yesterday, the survey has been completed and will be reported to the county government for review. At the same time, the Department of Finance has appointed Ye Tiesheng as the wasteland survey committee member for this county and is expected to come to Wuxi for a review survey with the committee members of the Department of Civil Affairs and Construction within a few days.</p>

<p>Tobacco and alcohol merchants in Wu County had a dispute with the tax bureau over the issue of license grades. The provincial bureau once sent a commissioner to Changzhou to investigate, but no solution was found. Recently, the Department of Finance sent Commissioner Huang Zhefu to Changzhou to investigate. On the afternoon of the 4th, a meeting of tobacco and alcohol merchants was convened at the County Chamber of Commerce to mediate. Sheng Jingfu, the representative of the County Party Department, and Dai Xizhi, the representative of the County Chamber of Commerce, participated. Zhu Jinzhang of the Tax Collection Office negotiated on the cigarette part. After the representatives made every effort to mediate, the cigarette industry resolved the issue by adding 20-30% to the original tax amount for both large and small businesses. The tobacco merchants and the tax bureau have agreed, and it can be said that it has come to an end. The alcohol merchants' problem is smaller and has not been discussed yet. It is planned to schedule another mediation session, which is generally not a problem. Commissioner Huang, with the results already achieved, left Changzhou for Wuxi today (the 5th).</p>

<p>Wang Qingdong, the chief of the Eighth District of Wu County, recently caused two bandits, Yang Jinchuan and Tang Shenggeng, to escape due to the negligence of the militia in handling a bandit case. County Magistrate Hou Houzong suspected that he had accepted bribes to release them and placed District Chief Wang in the custody of the political police for several days. Upon hearing the news, the district chiefs, considering that this year's drought has caused a disaster, the bandits in the four villages are gradually increasing, and the winter defense is tight, the defense regiments have been ordered to be abolished long ago, and the public security branches have also been cancelled one after another, the local strength is empty, and the district offices have no equipment, jointly tendered their resignations on the 4th. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Hou released District Chief Wang Qingdong and retained the district chiefs, and summoned the district chiefs today (the 5th) for talks, advising them to dismiss their intention to resign.</p>

<p>The weather in this county was hot for three days, from the 28th to the 30th of last month, just like early summer. On the 1st of this month, there was a strong wind for a day, and it rained that night. To this day, the 4th, the autumn rain is continuous day and night. The early rice in the villages has been harvested, and the late rice is also reaching the harvest season, needing sunlight to absorb moisture, so that the grains can be stored for a long time. Now, the ripe grains are likely to be knocked down into the mud, scattered all over the fields. Those who harvest have already sprouted. If the weather does not clear up again, the impact on the autumn harvest will be very significant.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu County Government convened a meeting of the directors of the Construction and Public Security Bureaus and the district chiefs at 3 p.m. today (the 3rd) to discuss the emergency conscription of labor for guiding the Huai River. The chairman was County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang. The summary of the resolutions is as follows: (1) Conscript 5,000 laborers for guiding the Huai River. (This is the minimum number. According to the provincial order, 12 counties must conscript 160,000 laborers in one period. Now, excluding Jiangdu's 5,000 laborers, each of the other 11 counties should conscript more than 14,000 laborers.) Each district shall apportion the assigned number of laborers as follows: each of the five districts, namely the first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, shall apportion 556 people, and each of the four districts, namely the third, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts, shall apportion 555 people. Each district shall apportion the number of conscripted laborers according to the above-mentioned assigned number to each old governing township, and shall conscript the required number within the time limit. The old governing townships of each district shall conscript laborers from their respective jurisdictions according to the assigned number and shall not neglect it in the slightest, so as not to delay the work. The laborers conscripted for guiding the Huai River can dig at least two to three cubic meters of mud per day. Each cubic meter is calculated at 8 cents of silver, so each person can earn 16 to 24 cents of silver per day. In order to show compassion for the hard work, each old governing township shall raise funds locally to provide each person with living expenses of 6 to 8 yuan of silver per month, to show preferential treatment.</p>

<p>In the area of Qitangxia Gaojiadun, Yaojiashetou, Wangjiashetou, and Yangdingqiu, which are located at the intersection of the Fifth and Sixth Districts of Yuyao, the sea tide broke through the embankment due to heavy rain the day before yesterday. The water depth in the salt farmers' houses was one foot deep, and the situation was extremely critical. The salt farmers fled to Liutang overnight for help and immediately loaded more than 20 ships of mud to rush to block the side of Qitang. Fortunately, the embankment was not badly damaged, and the sea tide receded soon after, so they were able to turn the crisis into safety. However, the salt farmers had already lost more than a thousand gold [monetary unit].</p>

<p>Zhong Ruilin and Zhong Xingsheng, farmers in Duanqiaotou near Siduan Port in Yindong, lived next door to each other and were quite well-off. At about 12 p.m. the night before (2nd), a group of 13 or 14 bandits broke into their homes and robbed them. At about 1 a.m., the bandits used a customary cannon to demonstrate their power and escaped with their loot. The farmers heard that it was not a gun, so they beat gongs to gather people to chase and capture them. The bandits were outnumbered and one bandit was killed. The rest crossed the river and fled. However, the farmers still bravely pursued and captured another bandit, Zong Lin, and sent him to the Panhuoqiao Police Station for verification. However, according to Zhang's confession, he was a highway worker and was just passing by and was captured, not a bandit.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Guo of Hefei, considering that there was no harvest in the autumn and the farmers in the four villages were cut off from their livelihoods, corresponded with the Nanjing Branch of the Shanghai Bank to request the bank to set up a farmer mortgage loan office in Hefei to provide relief. It has been matured and the bank has decided to invest 500,000 yuan for a trial period of two years. The location has been selected at the original site of the Dasheng Silk Shop in Gulou North, which has been undergoing major repairs and will be officially opened for business within a few days. Local public groups are currently discussing all mortgage loan methods, which is also a ray of hope for the countryside.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Letter of Correction <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having recently read in your newspaper (September 27 issue) the article stating: "Reactionary elements are actively engaging in treacherous activities in the war zone. Furthermore, the 'Humane Loving Charity Society' has been established in Tangshan. The majority of its members are from the lowest classes and among the traitors who have joined is Geng Zixiang..." I was shocked beyond measure. After graduating from the Baoding Military Academy in the 11th year of the Republic [1922], I have been working diligently and have always behaved within the bounds of propriety. Last winter, I returned to my hometown to visit relatives and have been keeping to myself, not interfering in any matters. In January of this year, Director Zhao of the Tangshan Special Public Security Bureau hired me as a consultant. Apart from occasionally assisting with official duties, I have not participated in any local organizations or societies. Unexpectedly, your newspaper has now branded me as a traitor and included me in the Humane Loving Charity Society. This situation suggests that a villain is fabricating names in an attempt to frame me. As this concerns personal reputation, it cannot be allowed to be damaged by others. In addition to filing a report with the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, I request that you immediately issue a correction to prevent misleading rumors. This would be most convenient.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Geng Zixiang, Consultant of the Tangshan Special Public Security Bureau</p>

<p>Chinese Consul in New York Presents Six Proposals</p>
<p>National Product Manufacturers to Jointly Study with Various Organizations</p>
<p>Local national product manufacturing organizations recently learned that Mr. Ye Keliang, the Chinese Consul in New York, telegraphed the government, reporting that Americans are now rejecting German goods, and Japanese goods are taking the opportunity to be sold in the United States. However, Chinese goods are quite popular with Americans. He specifically proposed six methods for promoting national products in the United States, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, instructing national product organizations across the country to pay close attention. It is advisable to start with the United States, organize a national product promotion agency, and establish national product associations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and other places to facilitate communication and seek convenience for American purchases. Upon hearing this news, the national product industry in Shanghai believes that this is a unique opportunity to promote national products. They will jointly study promotion methods with various national product organizations and request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to instruct the national industrial sector to join together to develop foreign markets.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Master Anqin Opened Altar Yesterday to Impart Dharma <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Impart Dharma for Four Days to Broaden Buddhist Connections</p>
<p>To Leave Shanghai on the 9th for Hong Kong and then Enter Tibet via India</p>
<p>Pujing Lama Anqin Hutuktu arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd of this month and resided at the Buddhist Jingye Society on Hed Road. On the afternoon of the 4th, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, he gave a lecture on the Hevajra Tantra. In response to the requests of lay Buddhists Wang Yiting, Tang Zhugong, Huang Hanzhi, Feng Yangshan, Wen Lanting, Li Yunshu, Qu Wenliu, and others from Buddhist organizations such as the Buddhist Jingye Society and the Chinese Buddhist Association, he opened an altar at the same society yesterday afternoon to impart the Dharma. The Dharma altar was set up in the Buddha hall on the second floor of the society, surrounded by yellow cloth. In the center of the altar was a Dharma seat covered with yellow cloth. Master Anqin sat cross-legged on it. Above the Dharma seat hung a horizontal banner with the black characters "The Dharma Wheel Turns Constantly" on yellow cloth. The arrangement was solemn. The Dharma will be imparted for a total of four days. The program is recorded as follows: The Hevajra Tantra on October 5th, the Guhyasamaja Tantra on the 6th, the Jnana-Vajra Tantra on the 7th, and the Avalokitesvara Dharma on the 8th. According to Anqin's translator, Mr. Wang, speaking to the *New News Agency* reporter, the first three Dharmas, according to the law, cannot be universally spread, so the number of people is limited. As for the Avalokitesvara Dharma on the 8th, all men, women, old, and young can receive the Dharma. However, they must register with the society in advance to broaden their Buddhist connections. It is also learned that after Master Anqin completes the Dharma imparting on the 8th, he has decided to take the Italian postal ship *Conte Verde* from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 9th, then transfer to the *Tina Leis* liner to Calcutta, disembark, and enter Tibet via India to arrange for the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet and promote the Central government's intentions.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yongping Rescues Chunhua <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Two Ships Arrive in Shanghai One After the Other</p>
<p>Yongping Acts Righteously and Courageously</p>
<p>Chunhua Expresses Gratitude</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Fuzhou-bound liner *Yongping* arrived in Shanghai later than scheduled this time, as it assisted in the rescue of the *Chunhua*, which was of great importance in preventing over two hundred people on board from running out of food and water. The ship has now arrived in Shanghai. The report on the ship rescue is described below. Manager Yu Da's *Chunhua* ship ran aground outside Quanzhou. After more than sixty days, workers and technicians from the Hongchang Machinery Factory were dispatched by the Shanghai Insurance Association to assist in the rescue. On September 23rd, it was pulled out of the reef and sailed to the sea near Jiunanji Mountain, where Fujian and Zhejiang meet. The engine suddenly broke down and could not move. The sea was very rough, and the *Chunhua* was unable to move. It drifted at sea for four consecutive days. The food and fresh water prepared on board were only enough for two days. Unexpectedly, an accident occurred halfway, and it was stranded at sea for more than four days. Food and water were cut off. There were a total of more than two hundred people on board, who had been starving for a long time, and there was no water. They had to try to catch a little bit of rainwater to quench their thirst. Just when they were in a dangerous situation, the ship owner, Hengsheng, sent an electric distress signal from the ship, which was received by the *Yongping*. The *Yongping* ship owner, Tang Liquan, sailed his ship to Jiunanji Mountain to do his best to rescue. The first priority was for the *Yongping* to provide rice and fresh water to prevent more than two hundred people from becoming starving ghosts. Then, he used iron cables to tow it to Sanpan South Port near Pingyang outside Wenzhou. At the same time, he telegraphed Shanghai to send a ship to rescue it, so that the *Chunhua* was able to escape danger and return to Shanghai, thanks to the righteous and courageous assistance of the *Yongping* ship owner, Tang Liquan. The *Chunhua* has returned to Shanghai and is now under repair. After the *Yongping* arrived in Shanghai, it reported the situation to the general office, which was greatly praised by the bureau. All the more than two hundred people on board the *Chunhua* expressed their gratitude to Mr. Tang and requested the Northeast Shipping Company to issue a formal letter to thank the *Yongping* ship owner, Mr. Tang, and all the crew members.</p>
<p>According to *New News Agency*, the Yuda Shipping Company's *Chunhua* cargo ship, which sailed from Niuzhuang to Quanzhou, ran aground mid-way. It was subsequently rescued by the *Yongping* and towed back to Shanghai. The company yesterday reported the grounding incident to the Maritime Bureau. The *New News Agency* reporter obtained the original text as follows: At 5:40 PM on July 18th, fully loaded with bean cakes, it departed Niuzhuang for Yantai to continue loading cargo. On the 20th, it departed Yantai. It encountered great difficulties due to strong winds passing through Qingdao. On July 26th, at 1:00 PM, it anchored on the ocean surface of Quanzhou. The draft of the bow was nineteen feet and one inch. At 1:00 PM, the pilot led the ship to raise anchor and enter the port. Unexpectedly, it ran aground at Chongwu outside Quanzhou. The second hold and coal bunker of the bow immediately leaked. It immediately reversed and retreated and ran aground a second time. The wheels were also hit. At that time, the tide was very rapid. It hired many small boats to unload the cargo and sent troops to guard it because there were many bandits there. It sent a telegram to ask for help. On the 31st, it received a reply from Shanghai, asking it to wait for assistance. By August 7th, no one had come to help. It sent another telegram for help and ordered the crew not to leave their posts. On the 19th, the *Haian* ship and several steamships sailed from Xiamen to unload the cargo. On the 22nd, the rescue team of thirty-six people and the Shanghai Insurance Company also came together from Shanghai. The seawater in the hold was then extracted. By the 25th, the cargo had been completely unloaded. On the 27th, it encountered thieves, who were repelled by the military police. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. On September 5th, it encountered a hurricane and the anchor chain was broken. It immediately replaced it with another anchor. By the 14th, all the goods had been unloaded. By the 17th, the holes in the hold had also been repaired. On September 22nd, after leaving Quanzhou and traveling to longitude 24 degrees 17 minutes and latitude 121 degrees, it suddenly heard a loud noise. The machine was damaged and the wheel came off. It immediately dropped anchor. Several rockets were fired at night in the hope that other ships would come to rescue them, but the result was ineffective. The radio was also damaged. On September 24th, a civilian ship passed by, so Fei Shixing and Xiang Zhuang were sent by boat to the shore to telegraph Shanghai for help. The weather was bad, with strong winds and heavy rain. The passengers on board were very panicked. Fortunately, on September 27th, the *Yongping* ship sailed over and began towing. At 3:00 PM on September 30th, it safely arrived in Shanghai.</p>

The work has now been completed, and they returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that the results of this trip were very satisfactory. Once the funds from all parties have been collected, preparations can be made for the highway to be open to traffic.</p>

<p>Plan to Seek Relief from Party and Government Organs Today</p>
<p>Eight People Still Detained in Japanese Police Station and Not Released</p>
<p>According to the *Daily News*, Japan expels our overseas Chinese compatriots using a method of piecemeal transportation to avoid the attention of our people. The previous two batches of those expelled and returned home numbered over a hundred people. Those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday were forced to leave at the end of last month and took the Japanese ship *Asama Maru*, arriving in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. They are still staying at the Lao Gongxin inn on the Bund, in extremely wretched condition. Most of them are small factory workers and hawkers, including Wu Wentian, Xu Baolian, Zhou Chengqi, Chen Ahai, Ma Jinji, Zhang Sanlai, Ma Zuofa, Sun Dianzhong, and Xu Zizhong, totaling ten people.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to Zhou Chengqi, an expelled overseas Chinese, speaking to a *Daily News* reporter, the Japanese expulsion of our overseas Chinese compatriots is not only devoid of any reason, but also too contemptuous of humanitarianism. The overseas Chinese compatriots who were expelled and returned home this time were beaten and kicked by Japanese police on the boats and trains, suffering greatly. After being forced to board the ship, the Japanese police confiscated all the remaining money that the overseas Chinese compatriots carried with them in their luggage. All of it was confiscated except for the money to purchase tickets. Therefore, when they arrived in Shanghai this morning, more than a dozen people were penniless. Fortunately, the owner of the Lao Gongxin inn, who is from the same hometown as many of the overseas Chinese compatriots, treated them well. However, those who have arrived here are unfamiliar with the place and their livelihood is precarious. They want to return to their hometowns, but they have no money for travel expenses. They plan to go to the City Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government two agencies tomorrow (i.e., today) to seek relief.</p>

<p>The Japanese government is quite concerned that the expulsion of overseas Chinese will be sensational, so it is using a cunning strategy of transporting them in succession. In addition to those who arrived in Shanghai today, there are still eight overseas Chinese compatriots who were detained by the Japanese police in the Minamisenju Police Station in Tokyo on the 27th of last month. They have not yet been released and have not been subjected to the same abuse. They may be expelled and returned home next time. The list is as follows: Wu Panbin, Pan Yipeng, Zhou Qinglu, Pan Linde, Lin Jinwen, Chen Zhenmin, Zhou Xiqin, and seven others. There is one other person whose name is unknown.</p>

<p>All Departments' Work Completely Suspended</p>
<p>Second Special District Court Held Trial Yesterday</p>
<p>Labor Union and Association Both Request Impartial Judgment</p>
<p>The Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory at 1102 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, because the Rubber Industry Union of the Second District, organized by the factory workers, sent personnel to the factory to collect membership fees, the two sides had not yet agreed on the number of days and the location of the collection, resulting in interference from the factory side. A major conflict and violent incident occurred between labor and management. Xue Fuji of the factory and four detectives sent by the political department of the patrol were injured, and factory workers were also injured. After the French patrol heard the alarm, they immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest Wang Diansheng, a Nanking native and director of the labor union who incited the assault, and took him back to the patrol station for investigation. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the factory immediately suspended work to await a legal resolution. The details were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is an investigation and record of the various news items yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e124">All Work Suspended <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to *Da Gong She*, after the disturbance at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory the day before yesterday due to preventing the union from collecting fees, the factory's accounting room and office were destroyed, and the factory's supplies were also in disarray. The factory believes that the workers gathered a crowd to cause trouble, causing significant losses to the factory. In addition to requesting the Party and government authorities to investigate the matter according to law, the factory announced yesterday that it would temporarily suspend work pending a resolution. The work of all departments, including the rubber bottom, face, lining, stripping, packaging, and cutting departments, was completely suspended. Many detectives were stationed at the factory entrance to prevent accidents. Although some workers went to work yesterday morning, they were all prevented from entering the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Thorough Party and Government Investigation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to *Da Gong She*, the Party and government authorities believe that the workers of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory gathered a crowd to cause trouble, assaulted the manager, and destroyed the factory buildings, considering the situation to be serious. Tan Peiyan of the Third Section of the Social Bureau was dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation. Yesterday, Dai Youheng of the Civil Affairs Section of the City Party Headquarters went to various parties to investigate the truth. After completing the investigation, Mr. Dai drove to the Social Bureau in the central district of the city to exchange views with Tan Peiyan in order to report to the Standing Committee and find a way to deal with the situation to prevent the labor unrest from prolonging.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Continued Detention of Workers <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>According to *Da Gong She*, when the disturbance occurred the day before yesterday, Wang Diansheng, the director of the labor union, was immediately arrested by the French patrol and taken to the patrol station for detention. He was sent to the Second Special Court for trial yesterday morning. Many factory workers went to listen to the trial. The injured detectives identified workers Xu A'gen, Zhao Mohai, Ren A'lin, and Wu Jingxi as those who committed the assault on the spot. They were immediately arrested and detained for secret interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e127">COURT HEARING <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>After Wang Dian Sheng was arrested, the police conducted a thorough investigation. Yesterday morning, Wang was escorted to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division 1, where Judge Xiong Hui Cui, along with Clerk Tao Zong Kan, presided over the trial. According to the police lawyer, Gu Shou Xi, the case's details were roughly as follows: The defendant, formerly a worker at the Da Zhong Hua Factory, was dismissed by the factory in May of this year for organizing a labor union. Out of the factory's 1,600 male and female workers, 200 strongly desired the remaining 1,400 to join the union, which they refused. Disputes arose, and the factory advised against forcing membership. The defendant, being a dismissed worker, returned to the factory without justification. Amidst a serious and chaotic situation, the police department, upon hearing the news, dispatched four detectives to maintain order. Because of the defendant's shout to "attack," a group of workers echoed the riot. At that time, five workers and four detectives were beaten and injured. When the defendant was arrested, he resisted fiercely and threw a teacup at his head, causing injury, which can be proven by factory employees. However, Mei Cai (transliteration), the head of the Bei Dang Road Police Station, personally led detectives to suppress the situation, firing several shots into the air to quell the disturbance. Today, three more workers involved in the violence were arrested, and the police are investigating. Based on the crimes of obstructing official duties and inciting injury under criminal law, the defendant is being prosecuted, and the court is requested to handle the matter according to the law. The court then summoned the plaintiff, Factory Owner Xue Fu Ji, who was represented by Lawyer Li Mo, who stated that Xue Fu Ji could not attend due to injuries, but the factory had also suffered losses and requested to file a civil lawsuit. The losses suffered had not yet been calculated clearly and requested temporarily reserving the right to do so. The judge then questioned the defendant, Wang Dian Sheng, who stated: He is 35 years old, from Nanjing, and was a former worker at the Da Zhong Hua Rubber Factory, where he worked for five years. He stopped working there in May of this year. Yesterday, he did not go to the factory. He and Yu Shao Qing, the secretary of the First District Rubber Union, were eating buns at a restaurant at the intersection of Wen Lin Road. At the Jin Ji Bridge, they met Zhang You Cai, Chen Yu Cheng, and Xue Jin He from the union, who said they were going to the factory to collect membership fees, and that Zhu Jin Sheng, a standing director, had reported to the city party headquarters, and Mr. Dai You Heng had mediated, and Manager Xue Fu Ji had agreed to put a table in the car workshop to collect money for three days, the fourth, fifth, and sixth. The membership fee was two jiao per worker, and non-members were not charged. The Second District Rubber Union was established at the end of last year, with only 800 members from the Da Zhong Hua workers. My dismissal issue has not yet been resolved, so I am still a member. Yesterday, male and female workers went to the city party headquarters to petition, and the party headquarters sent Mr. Ji to mediate. Because Mr. Ji called someone to accompany him, Zhang Wu Chang and I hired three rickshaws to go together. However, I was unconscious at the time and did not know how the injury to my face occurred. Later, I was arrested by detectives, etc. The court then summoned and questioned the injured police detectives. Detective No. 328 testified that yesterday afternoon, a little after one o'clock, the police station received a call from the Da Zhong Hua Rubber Factory, so they sent me to investigate the cause. When I arrived at the factory, I saw people hitting others with iron bars. I went to the accounting room, and someone shouted, "Don't run, attack! Kill them!" Because there were so many people, I couldn't see clearly. My head was broken, so I escaped. Detective No. 319 testified that the one shouting to attack was the defendant Wang Dian Sheng. Wang immediately denied shouting. Detective No. 332 testified that he was stationed at the factory. In the morning, the manager did not allow the union to set up a table to collect membership fees. Dai You Heng from the city party headquarters came and said that it could be placed temporarily, but not permanently. The manager then summoned Xue Jin He and others and questioned them. Xue and others said that nine out of ten unions want bloodshed, and they shouted and committed violence, using steel lasts and other objects as weapons, and attacked. The one who hit me was Pan De Bao, and the one who hit the people beside me was Yang Zhen Gui. I jumped out of the wall, and they shouted, "Down with the running dogs!" Detective No. 357 testified that the ones shouting and attacking were the defendant Wang Dian Sheng, etc. The judge also summoned Mei Cai Ge Liu, the head of the Bei Dang Road Police Station, and Deputy Head Ge La Di for questioning. After hearing the situation, because it was past noon, the court announced that the trial would continue at 2:00 PM. The four injured detectives returned to the hospital for treatment. At 2:15 PM, Judge Xiong continued the trial in Criminal Division 1. Witnesses Fang Zhen Hai, Zhang Jing Yang, Xue A Lin, Lu Xiang Gao, Yu Xing Hao, and others from the factory testified about being beaten. Guo Yao Qing, a Shandong native, the factory's security guard, also testified about the violent events. Finally, Detective No. 316 reported the circumstances of the defendant's arrest. Because the witnesses were not all present, the court adjourned the trial to 2:00 PM on the 15th and ordered the defendant to be held in custody. Before the court hearing this case that day, three workers with the surnames Zhang, Wu, and Xue, who were involved in the violence, came to the court, first went to the registration office to get admission tickets, and when they entered the First Court to listen, they were encountered by the detectives who were at the scene at that time, who immediately arrested them and took them back to the police station for investigation, waiting to be escorted to the court for trial today and merge the cases.</p>
<h3 id="e128">LABOR UNION DECLARATION <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Second District Rubber Industry Union issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Da Zhong Hua dispute, stating: Since our union held elections on September 23rd, although the time has been short, we have not dared to boast about reorganizing union affairs and harmonizing labor-management relations, but it can be said that the results have been remarkable. For example, repeated postings of notices, strict emphasis on union records, and letters advising the factory are numerous, which can be proven by the facts and cannot be completely erased. It is believed that those in charge of the factory, with their understanding, can also imagine this. The occurrence of this unfortunate incident was truly unexpected, but upon thorough investigation, one cannot help but feel sorry for the factory. The cause of this unfortunate incident was extremely minor. The next day, our union sent personnel to the factory to request convenience for the union to collect membership fees. Comrade Dai You Heng from the city party headquarters was present, and after discussions among the three parties, it was agreed that the factory would allocate the car workshop to set up a temporary office, to be implemented for three days from October 3rd to 5th. Our union members, upon hearing the report, unanimously believed that managers Xue and Wu were worthy of being called wise and capable, and their handling was appropriate. They were delighted that sincere cooperation could be expected. However, the unfortunate breach of trust was like a bolt from the blue. October 3rd was peaceful, but on the morning of the 4th, the factory removed the tables and chairs from the car workshop. When Qiu Guan Sheng, a director of our union, inquired about it, he was told that it was inconvenient in the morning and would wait until the afternoon. By the afternoon, the factory was straightforward and blunt, stating that it was impossible to deal with, and in an instant, detectives were secretly deployed. Thus, this unfortunate incident unfortunately began, with more than a dozen live rounds fired, threatening workers who had no weapons, intending to make the workplace, which workers rely on for their lives, a burial ground. After the injured workers fled the factory gate and petitioned the party headquarters, the factory even regarded passersby as workers, injuring Mr. Wang from Pu Dong, and arresting and injuring Wang Dian Sheng, a director of our union who had come with representatives from the party headquarters to investigate. Alas, when the city gate is breached, fish in the pond are affected. What are people to do? This is unbearable to hear. This is a brief account of the incident. For several years, our union members have believed that they have not only been without fault, but have also made great contributions. For example, the factory's capital has suddenly increased from 70,000 to 80,000 to 8 million in five or six years. When Manager Xue was detained by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation movement the year before last, all the male and female workers went to plead for his release. These are the major examples. As for the worsening labor-management relations in recent years, it is due to the factory's jealousy of workers organizing unions, reducing wages by 60%, arbitrarily dismissing and transferring workers, and raising the status of relatives, among other unfair actions. It is hoped that all circles will understand, base their judgments on facts, and make fair decisions. This is our earnest prayer. This declaration is hereby made.</p>
<h3 id="e129">COMPANY LETTER <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>A letter from the Da Zhong Hua Rubber Factory Company to this newspaper states: We respectfully inform you that a worker riot occurred at our factory on the afternoon of the 4th, and we have briefly described the situation. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 5th, we convened a temporary meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, and the following was resolved: (Above omitted) On October 4th, a group of workers prearranged to form a team, disrupting each department during working hours, coercing strikes, and plotting riots. We had no choice but to request protection from the French police. Before the detectives arrived at the factory, workers such as Zhang You Cai led more than a hundred workers, rushing out from inside, carrying weapons, hitting anyone they encountered, and destroying anything they saw. They disobeyed the detectives' attempts to stop them and instead surrounded and beat them. The detectives avoided them by entering the accounting room, but the rioters destroyed the accounting room. Manager Xue, eight employees, and detectives were all beaten and injured. Such wanton rioting clearly indicates prior organization and a separate background, with the intention of causing disturbance and creating a serious impact. However, the factory had reported to the city party headquarters and the social affairs bureau before and after the incident, requesting them to stop it in the hope of eliminating it. However, the incident was unexpected, and the factory has lost its guarantee. Under this violent coercion, it is difficult for the factory to reopen without complete and adequate guarantees. If it affects the branch factories or the raw material factory, we can only bear the pain of completely liquidating. Before there is a solution, the company will temporarily send personnel to oversee it. (Below omitted) The details of the incident are further elaborated to clarify the truth. Since the summer of this year, there has been a severe drought without rain, and rural areas have gone bankrupt, resulting in the company's galoshes being slow to sell and both goods and accounts being in trouble. Therefore, both the first and second factories stopped production for eighty days. Although work resumed on August 27th, sales have not been smooth, so reducing production is also a last resort. Soon after, more than 70 galoshes bottom workers working on piece rate in the first factory, including Qiu Guan Qing, requested an increase in work. We told them that they were not listening to dispatch and were unwilling to be reassigned to other departments. They could only wait for the increase in sales, and there was no other way. Therefore, at that time, we still planned to adjust several workers to other departments to make adjustments. However, Liu De Gui and others stated that a meeting must be held before a decision could be made. Unexpectedly, the next day, the labor union sent a letter that did not mention the adjustment to other departments, but insisted on restoring the previous work requirements. It can be seen that they were deliberately making things difficult for our factory. Recently, the stock has slightly sold, and the number of galoshes produced per day has increased from 2,000 pairs to about 6,000 pairs. The income of each worker has also increased accordingly, but their actions are still extremely arrogant. Therefore, we know that they are not purely for the issue of increasing income, but are actually intending to sabotage. Therefore, we reported to the party and government organs for thorough investigation, but the party and government have not yet made any statement. A week ago, more than 70 of them formed a team to harass the work places of each department. On the 3rd, it was even worse. We asked Mr. Dai You Heng of the Civil Mediation Section of the Party Department to come to the factory to persuade them. At that time, all three parties stated that they would no longer harass the work place. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Dai left, the harassment continued as before. On the morning of the 4th, they came to harass again. The factory told the Party Department, and Mr. Dai instructed the labor union representatives to go to the department to negotiate, but they refused. Xue Jin He, Huang Jin Sheng, Chen Yu Cheng, and others said that it would not stop until blood flowed. The situation was fierce. Then we saw Wang Dian Sheng, Qiu Guan Qing, and others watching outside rush in, gather the crowd, and each hold weapons to rush into the accounting room, hitting anyone they encountered and destroying anything they saw. The objects and windows in the accounting room were completely destroyed. For a time, men shouted and women cried, and the order was chaotic. The rioters, seeing that no one was interfering, did their best to commit violence, and each department suffered huge losses. When many patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, they dispersed in a crowd and then went to Jin Ji Bridge to gather, forcibly pulling male and female workers to the city party headquarters to petition in the name of workers. This kind of riot did not occur when wages were less than five jiao per day, but occurred today when wages have reached more than six jiao per day. It is obvious that it was organized in advance and intended to destroy it, which is beyond doubt. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and foreign goods are being dumped, the rubber industry is even more precarious. Our company is still trying to support it for the sake of the workers' livelihoods, but this part of the workers is so violent that the company is forced to this point and has no way to deal with it. We hope that you will investigate and uphold public opinion, and the future of national goods depends on it. Sincerely, Da Zhong Hua Rubber Factory Xing Ye Co., Ltd. October 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e134">THE BEAN AND RICE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO PRESENT ITS VIEWS ON IMPROVING THE BROKERAGE TAX <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Lists four items to request the Finance Bureau to handle flexibly</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association believed that the new brokerage business rules and the detailed rules for the collection of brokerage tax in this city were difficult for various industries to implement. It sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to convene a joint meeting of various brokerage industries to discuss remedial measures. The City Chamber of Commerce convened various industries for discussion on the 27th of last month. Four methods were discussed and resolved, and the original letter has been forwarded to the City Finance Bureau for flexible handling. The original text has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the association believes that there are still imperfections in the points discussed the day before yesterday, so it specially lists four items of opinions based on the special circumstances of the industry: (1) The business items of the bean and rice industry are extremely complicated. If each item of goods must have a certificate, there will be more than ten certificates. Those who are brokers cannot bear this major burden. Therefore, the association believes that the business items of the bean and rice industry should be summarized into three categories: A. Rice, B. Miscellaneous grains (including beans, wheat, and all other miscellaneous grains), C. Oils (including various oils and cakes made from their residues). When reporting for registration certificates, it should be limited to these three certificates at most. (2) When the brokerage obtains the certificate, it pays taxes first, and there is no need to provide a guarantee or pay a deposit separately. The joint meeting decided that the registration certificate should be certified and obtained on behalf of each industry association, which is the most appropriate method. However, the association believes that it should be further stated that anyone who registers the certificate and obtains it on behalf of each industry association will no longer need to provide a guarantee or pay a deposit separately. (3) The application form for obtaining the certificate originally set by the City Finance Bureau must state the annual turnover and brokerage income. The prosperity and decline of each brokerage business often changes with the prosperity and decline of the social economy and the smoothness of market transactions. There are monthly and yearly changes, so it is difficult to predict profit and loss. Moreover, those who obtain a long-term certificate will estimate the business situation within five years, and even sages cannot foresee it. Therefore, the association believes that it is difficult to fill in the above regulations. (4) The application form must also be attached with a photo of the brokerage. According to the brokerage is also one of the merchants. It has not been heard that other industries have paid and pasted photos to the official. Why is the brokerage discriminated against alone? Therefore, the association believes that merchants in various industries receive equal treatment from the government. It is not convenient to comply with the matter of brokerage households paying verification photos. It is heard that the above four opinions have been sent to the City Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the City Finance Bureau, which is requested to allow flexible handling.</p>

<p>The Ant Society at 536 Sichuan Road was organized by enthusiastic cultural figures. Since being registered with the Education Bureau, the society has been developing rapidly, with more than 500 members. The Ant Correspondence Library, which lends books to readers unconditionally, is well-known at the time, and nearly a thousand people have borrowed books, as far away as Korea. The Ant Theater Troupe performed in the spring and won countless praises. Other activities such as reading groups, friendship meetings, and travel photography have all given people a beautiful impression and have a profound cultural movement meaning. Therefore, requests to join are endless. In response to external requests and to complete a year-long plan, a congress for recruitment will be held for one month. The society held the opening ceremony of the recruitment congress at the YMCA the other day, and more than fifty people, including Zhuang Hua, Wang Weiyi, Tu Tinghao, Yu Peiwen, Lan Simian, and Huang Tiren, the captains of each team, attended. The situation was very enthusiastic. It is heard that in order to seek true comrades, the society is implementing open recruitment.

A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency specifically inquired at the office of the preparatory committee yesterday. The construction of the fish market has long been planned, but it has not been implemented due to funding constraints. The funding was originally set at 1,671,000 yuan, which was reduced to 1 million yuan by the Central Political Committee, and the drawings were changed. Now all the plans are in place, and the Ministry of Industry has also raised the funds, so it was decided to start bidding today. The location has been surveyed at Zhou Jia Zui Island, Ding Hai Bridge, Yang Shu Pu, with a total area of ​​more than forty acres. After multiple consultations between the association and the landowners, they have agreed to lease it for use. The land is located along the Pu River, where the river water is deep and can accommodate a large number of fishing boats. This bidding is for the entire construction of the market, including (1) the fish market, (2) the warehouse, (4) the cold storage, etc. The estimated cost is about 500,000 yuan, which is designed by architect Xu Jingzhi. In addition, the floating bank is planned to be built by the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the cold storage machine is planned to be designed and ordered by the United Engineering Company. In addition to the entire building, there is also room for future expansion. This bidding will be closed in the middle of this month. After signing the contract, construction can be started at the beginning of next month. After a part of the market is completed, the cold storage equipment and radio will be added to preserve fresh fish and report on fish harvests and market prices. In addition, it is planned to add several transport steamships to tow fishing boats to Chongming Island and other places. It is said that the completion of the entire market will be no later than the middle of next spring.</p>

<h3 id="e137">ROBBERS ROB THE POST OFFICE <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Everyone sending letters was driven away together</p>
<p>Approximately 300 yuan was robbed</p>
<p>The Xin Zha Road Post Office branch at 79 Xin Zha Road, Changsha Road, Public Concession, was at approximately 10:50 AM yesterday, when the staff was busy receiving and delivering mail, when three robbers suddenly broke in, speaking Shanghai dialect, each wearing blue-black silk long gowns, and holding pistols. First, everyone in the office who was delivering mail was ordered to leave the door. The letter senders, seeing this situation, all fled with their heads in their hands. One robber followed the crowd out and stood guard at the door. The two robbers inside raised their guns and entered the counter from under the counter door. First, they guarded the branch director, and then they monitored each staff member, not allowing them to make any noise or act. The staff members were unable to resist, so they had to let the robbers do what they wanted. They watched as the robbers first searched the money order counter, then robbed the stamp counter, and finally forced the branch director Luo to hand over the key to the silver cabinet. When one of the robbers was about to open the cabinet, he suddenly became anxious and fled outside. Another robber, thinking that the matter outside had been leaked, did not have time to open the lock, so he also took the key and fled with him. Therefore, the silver cabinet was not opened. After the robbers left the door, the staff members urgently used the telephone to report to the Xin Zha Police Station. The police station immediately dispatched detectives to rush to the scene, but the robbers had already fled far away. After inspecting the money order and stamp counters, the total loss was more than 298 yuan. The detectives inspected the scene and reported back to the police station, and then went out to pursue the robbers. The branch also immediately reported to the headquarters to request that someone be sent to investigate and arrest the robbers.</p>
<h3 id="e138">HU XI YUAN HOPES THAT THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL PAY ATTENTION TO QINGDAO'S INDUSTRY <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Transportation and products are suitable for handling industry</p>
<p>Do not only regard it as a summer resort and tourist area</p>
<p>Industrial tycoon Hu Xi Yuan recently returned to Shanghai from North China. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Hu and asked about the recent situation of industry in North China. After a long conversation, he paid special attention to Qingdao's industry. Mr. Hu said that Qingdao was purely a military port during the German occupation, so there was absolutely no industry to speak of. Since our country took it back, it was changed to a commercial port, and citizens began to gradually promote industry. Although it has not yet reached the stage of development, the future is unlimited. Its workers are diligent, hard-working, and obedient to command, and the industrial raw materials are abundant. It is easier to start handling industry than in any other place in the country. The agricultural products of the area are cotton, tobacco leaves, peanuts, beef, and fruits, which are the most common. There are also marine products. The raw materials for glass are also very rich. The coal, which is indispensable in industry, is also very convenient to transport in Qingdao. The city has the Ji Lu Needle Factory and the Qingdao Stone Company, which are not available in this city, and especially the products of the Stone Company, such as marble, marble, and various beautiful stone materials for construction, are enough to defeat the imported goods worth tens of millions of yuan every year. In short, Qingdao's transportation, water conservancy, products, and folk customs are all suitable for the conditions for handling industry, and the security is very good and the climate is excellent. Since the loss of the four provinces, it has become the throat of North China and will surely become a very important industrial and commercial area in the country in the future. I hope that the Chinese people will no longer only regard Qingdao as a summer resort, ignore its industry and commerce, and sit back and let foreigners take the place of the authorities, and wait until they have developed their great power to the point where it is impossible to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e139">THE VANGUARD OF JAPANESE GOODS DUMPING HAS ARRIVED IN SHANGHAI <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>What are the feelings of the Chinese people?</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese Goods Sample Exhibition was originally scheduled to be held at Yipinxiang from the 7th to the 9th. Later, due to the opposition from the Chinese side, it was changed to the original site of the North Fu Department Store. On the 4th, the 18 members of the sample group arrived in port on the Nagasaki Maru. According to the president of the Otani Wholesale Guidance Society, the Japanese reporter said that the Sino-Japanese national conditions have gradually returned to normal, and this sample exhibition is of profound significance. Initially, there were 85 companies that joined the exhibition. Due to the wind and water disaster in the Kansai region, most of the products in Osaka have been suspended. There are currently 35 companies in Tokyo, 18 in Osaka, 10 in Nagoya, and 2 in Gifu. In the future, the second event will reach hundreds. The purpose of this sample exhibition is to restore the reduced purchasing power after the incident. There are currently 17,000 to 18,000 items of goods being shipped.</p>
<h3 id="e140">National Zhang Zhongjie Invents Peace Fire Extinguishing Grenade <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Patent Application, Low Price</p>
<p>The Peace Industrial Factory, located at Heji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, Shanghai, manufactures various Peace fire extinguishers and all kinds of firefighting equipment. Due to their low price and good quality, they are well-received by all sectors. It is learned that Mr. Zhang Zhongjie, a technician at the factory, has recently invented a Peace fire extinguishing grenade. It is a glass vacuum containing liquefied carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). When encountering burning gasoline or alcohol, the grenade can be thrown into the fire at any intensity, immediately releasing carbon dioxide gas, completely extinguishing the fierce flames in an instant. After many tests, the results are excellent, making it a truly beneficial tool for fire prevention. Each unit is sold for only two yuan in national currency. It is reported that a patent application has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry. According to Mr. Zhu Binghai, a researcher at the Central Meteorological Institute, the climate this winter is expected to be drier and colder than last year. Therefore, the factory is now actively rushing to produce stock to meet the urgent needs of society.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Foreman of Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory Assassinated <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Thugs Break into Bedroom in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>One Shot to the Chest, Severely Wounded</p>
<p>Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory is located at No. 20, Liyuan Road, Luban Road, Nanshi. It has been established for fourteen years. There is a foreman named Ni A'er, 39 years old, from Tongzhou, who joined the factory as a worker when it first opened. Due to his years of service, he has risen to the position of foreman. He is also honest, so he is highly trusted by the factory. He currently earns a monthly salary of 30 yuan and is responsible for managing workers and directing all work. The factory even allowed Ni A'er to move his wife, Ms. Wu, and their three children into the factory workshop for his convenience in supervising the work. Unexpectedly, at about 2:30 AM yesterday morning, just as Ni A'er and his wife and children were sound asleep, three bandits, each armed with a pistol, pushed open the factory gate from behind the factory workshop and broke into Ni's bedroom. Without asking any questions, they fired a shot at Ni A'er's chest, who was asleep in bed. The bullet entered below the right nipple and exited from the right waist in the back, causing blood to gush out instantly. The assailants, seeing their goal achieved, immediately turned and fled. Ni's wife, Ms. Wu, was awakened by the gunshot. She saw her husband lying stiff in a pool of blood, barely breathing. She was terrified and cried out loudly. At the same time, other workers in the factory also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. There was a commotion and much discussion. It was not until about 5 AM at dawn that an ambulance was called to take Ni to the Penglai Road Yuezhifu Hospital for treatment, accompanied by his elder brother, Yan Shaoshou, his uncle, Yan Haichun, and the deputy foreman, Ji A'tao. Due to excessive blood loss and severe injuries, he was then transported by car to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. However, since the case involved assassination, the hospital, as a matter of procedure, reported it to the Aivenyi Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. After investigation, Yan Shaoshou and others were considered to be highly suspicious. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's Ximen Branch was immediately notified to dispatch police to arrest Yan Shaoshou and others and take them to the station for questioning. Meanwhile, they went to the scene of the incident to investigate and found a bullet head in Ni's bedroom, which they took back to the police station for examination. They are now investigating the details of the case in order to apprehend the assailants. However, based on the circumstances, it is likely that the assassination was motivated by revenge.</p>

<p>Prostitute Declares Unwillingness to Claim the Body</p>
<p>Body Handed Over to Pushan Villa for Burial</p>
<p>Wang Huangshi, an old woman from Wuxi, 67 years old, was working as a maid at the home of prostitute Li Huifang at No. 42, Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road. At about 8 AM the day before yesterday, she was sent by her mistress to buy vegetables. While crossing Aiduya Road, intending to go from north to south across the road, a British man, Bo Jisi (transliteration), was speeding west on a motorcycle with license plate number 2058. He was unable to brake in time and knocked the old woman down. A police officer arrived and recorded the motorcycle number. He then notified the Laozha Police Station to send an ambulance. The injured woman was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but she died soon after. The body was taken to the Philan Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, appointed by the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. The British man, Bo Jisi, testified that he was 22 years old, resided in the French Concession, and worked at the Yipin Bank. On that day, he was riding his motorcycle, license number 2058, from west to east on Aiduya Road when the old woman suddenly crossed the road from north to south from the sidewalk. He only saw her when she was about two feet away, so he braked immediately, but it was too late. The brothel owner, Li Huifang, testified that she was 21 years old, from Wuxi, and worked as a prostitute. The deceased was her maid. Yesterday morning, she ordered her to go out to buy vegetables. She did not know that she had been hit by a car until someone told her. Her family members are all in her hometown. She has already written to notify them. She cannot claim the body on their behalf. After hearing the testimonies, Tang determined that the deceased, Wang Huangshi, was a female who died from injuries sustained after being hit by motorcycle number 2058. As there were no family members to claim the body, it was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Departure of Chief Martin of the Shanghai Municipal Police <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The colleagues of Mr. R.M.J. Martin, the Extra Chief and Prison Superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Police, wrote an article to send him off as he was granted leave from the Municipal Council. The article reads, "Jiang Lang has a line, 'What dims the soul most is only parting.' Today, there is someone who will bid farewell to the Chinese and foreign society of Shanghai. Who is this person? It is none other than Mr. R.M.J. Martin, who has stayed in Shanghai for many years, has long served as a police chief, and holds the position of Extra Chief and Prison Superintendent. During the European War, he once joined the British Expeditionary Force as a captain. He has now been granted retirement by the Municipal Council. Since 1905, he came to Shanghai to assist in organizing and training the police force. His goal was to cultivate honest, brave, and efficient Chinese and foreign personnel. He is not only admired by his compatriots, but also has deep friendships with many Chinese people. Without a thorough knowledge of Chinese, how could he have achieved this? He is indeed the one who has the widest circle of friends and the most guests among Chinese and Westerners. Not only did he master Chinese himself, but he also paid close attention to the study of Chinese by Western personnel, as it is considered a matter of course in the Municipal Council's regulations for Westerners to read Chinese. As a person, he has received advanced training. He is cautious and decisive in handling matters, possessing the demeanor of Zhuge. Although he is strict with his subordinates, his colleagues all respect and love him. He has served in the Municipal Council for as long as twenty-nine years, rising through the ranks to his current position and repeatedly filling the vacancy of Chief. The Municipal Council is extremely pleased to have such a police chief. He is able to cope with difficult situations and handle them appropriately. These achievements are unmatched by any police chief. Otherwise, the results of cooperation with the Chinese authorities would not be as satisfactory as they are today. He has been awarded the First Class Medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force by the National Government. Today's China is certainly not comparable to the past when awards were given out too liberally. It is certainly a great honor for a Westerner to receive this. Moreover, not only is his own hard work seen by the people of Shanghai, but he is also able to take into account the hopes of his colleagues for a satisfactory life. Because of his strong leadership of the Chinese, Western, Japanese, and Indian police, all the police officers, under his guidance, are able to devote themselves to their duties. These two points have enabled the public concession police force to achieve its highest efficiency. The duty of the police is to ensure the safety and security of society. The ability of the police to fulfill their duties is the honor of the police authorities. He has strengthened the material satisfaction of all police personnel, confirming that this is a basic condition for improving work efficiency. Now that he is about to leave, the various achievements he has made in the police force provide a model for those who succeed him to assist in the police affairs and build trust in all parties. This is a success of his career, and it also reveals his honor. Although he is leaving, because of his hard work, the public concession police force has made great achievements, and he can be content. On this day of sadness for both Chinese and Westerners, their only sincere wish for him is that his health may be boundless and his happiness may be boundless."</p>

<p>Defendant Wang Appeals to the Supreme Court, Ordered for Retrial</p>
<p>Testimony Conducted Yesterday, Waiting for Huang Shaotang for Further Testimony</p>
<p>On March 24th, 1932, at approximately 8 PM, a shooting occurred in the Shanguangdao area of Hong Kong, resulting in the death of Feng Deqian. It was later learned that Zheng Guoyou had instructed the rickshaw driver Liu Xing (also known as Ah Liu) to hire a killer to murder Feng Deqian because Feng Deqian had stolen his lover, the movie star Li Minghui. Liu then negotiated with Xu Yongchen, promising 2,000 yuan for the job. Xu Yongchen then negotiated with Wang Nengxiang, who agreed. That evening, when Feng Deqian and Li Minghui went out for a walk, Wang shot and killed Feng. The above information was provided by Xu Yongchen in the Hong Kong court, and Li Minghui testified that she witnessed the assailant wearing a coffee-colored suit, which was similar to the color of the suits Wang Nengxiang usually wore. Later, the Hong Kong Police Bureau gave Wang Nengxiang's photo to witnesses Ye Youtian, Jiang Jiamou, and Zhang Kunyuan for identification. They all confirmed that the photo was indeed Wang Nengxiang. After Wang Nengxiang was arrested, he was interrogated and sentenced by the First Special District Court. He refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Jiangsu High Second Branch Court. On August 3rd, 1933, the Second Instance sentenced him to life imprisonment. Wang still refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court. As a result, the original sentence was revoked and remanded to the Jiangsu High Second Branch Court for retrial. Due to jurisdictional issues, Wang Nengxiang was transferred to the Nanshi District Court for investigation, which concluded and charged the criminal court, requesting a public trial. The defendant Wang Nengxiang hired lawyer Pan Zhe to defend him. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, Judge Sun Jikang specially opened the Fifth Court for the trial. Defendant Wang Nengxiang was brought to the court. He stated that he was 29 years old, from Nantong, and worked as a carpenter. (Question) When did you go to Hong Kong? (Answer) I went to Hong Kong in 1929. (Question) When did you come back? (Answer) I came back at the end of the fourth lunar month of 1931. (Question) Do you know Xu Yongchen? (Answer) No, I don't know him. (Question) Did you stay at the Jintan Hotel on March 8th, 1931? (Answer) No. (Question) Do you know Liu Xing, Zheng Guoyou's rickshaw driver? (Answer) No, I don't know him. (Question) Did Xu Yongchen give you 50 yuan and a pistol in the Hong Kong court and tell you to kill Feng Deqian? (Answer) I don't know him, so how could this have happened? (Question) Zhang Kunyuan followed you to Shanghai and arrested you? (Answer) I was really wronged. (Question) Do you have a Western suit? (Answer) Yes, the color is red and black. (Question) The official said, then that's right. The assailant was wearing a brown suit, which is similar to the color you said. Moreover, Xu Yongchen said you shot the gun in the Hong Kong court, and Li Minghui also said it very clearly in the Special District Court. (Answer) I was really wronged, because most people in Hong Kong wear Western suits. (Question) Where were you at the time? (Answer) I went to the Guangdong Dadong Company from Hong Kong on February 10th, 1932, and returned to Hong Kong on March 2nd. I stayed in the Dadong Company factory in Guangzhou every night, and Mao Er, who was in the same room, can prove it. Huang Shaotang can also prove it. (Question) Do you have any rebuttal evidence to present? (Answer) Because the Dadong Company has already closed down, the Special District Court went to investigate, but there were no results. (Question) Where are Mao Er and Huang Shaotang now? (Answer) I don't know. At this point, lawyer Pan Zhe stood up and said, "Please adjourn the court for two weeks. It has now been found that the witness Mao Er's whereabouts are unknown. However, Huang Shaotang's father is in Shanghai. It is said that Huang Shaotang has returned to his hometown. After verifying Huang's address, a subpoena will be submitted to the court to summon him to court to testify and exonerate the innocent." (Question) The official approved it. He instructed lawyer Pan to quickly investigate where Huang Shaotang is actually located and inform the court so that a verdict can be made as soon as possible. After the instructions were given, the court adjourned. Wang Nengxiang was ordered to remain in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Electric Silk Weaving Factory Guild Praises Da Xin Silk and Satin Bureau <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Since its opening, Da Xin National Silk and Satin Bureau at the intersection of Third Avenue and Shilu Road has been very popular among ladies from all walks of life. Therefore, despite the recent days of cloudy and rainy weather, customers have been crowding the store, which is very different from the past. This shows the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for patriotic goods after the national crisis. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Guild believes that the bureau's shift in business strategy has a spirit of commercial revolution and has already sent a letter of praise. Yesterday, the Shanghai Electric Yarn Weaving Factory Guild also followed up with a letter to the bureau, expressing its support, and expressing its outrage at the common practice of salespeople using fine domestic silk and satin to pass off as foreign goods. The original letter stated: "Respected Bureau, your adoption of a plan to fully promote domestic silk and satin in order to assist the government's policy of production to save the country not only provides effective relief for our country's declining silk industry but also allows our guild members, who are working hard, to have a place to stand tall. Our guild members, in view of the import and dumping of foreign goods, do their best to study the patterns, materials, costs, and prices in order to resist. As a result, the exquisiteness of many domestic silk and satin is comparable to foreign goods, and the price is lower than that of foreign goods that must be subject to tariffs. However, salespeople in the market do not promote them and use the psychology of the Chinese people's fondness for foreign goods to pass off fine domestic goods as foreign goods, which undermines the achievements of our members' efforts. It is extremely distressing. Fortunately, your bureau has risen up and built a new base for domestic silk and satin, which will surely wash away the shame of passing off fine domestic products as foreign goods and encourage our guild members to continue their efforts. In addition to our gratitude, we hereby send this letter to express our thanks and express our willingness to do our best to support the implementation of your plan."</p>

<p>Since the Wuxi Anti-Smoking Association issued a notice requiring opium smokers to register by September 30, most opium smokers in Wuxi have complied and registered. The fee for a Class A license is six yuan, and the fee for a Class B license is six cents. Those who register receive a receipt. However, in view of the fact that sales and smoking places and official opium shops have not yet been established, opium smokers still go to the original opium dens to smoke. Unexpectedly, at about 4 pm on the 3rd of this month, the Wuxi Public Security Bureau secretly dispatched a large number of policemen to arrest all opium dens inside and outside the city. Most opium smokers carried receipts from the Anti-Smoking Association, but they were all caught. Therefore, in the past two days, all opium smokers who escaped the net in Wuxi have boarded the Beijing-Shanghai train and fled to Shanghai in a state of extreme embarrassment. They are now discussing countermeasures.</p>

<p>Demanding a Divorce</p>
<p>Zhou Guansan, the Chinese general manager of the Far East Aircraft Company and a native of Hangzhou, was recently sued in the First Special Court by his wife, Wang Yuqing, represented by lawyer Le Junying, requesting cohabitation and payment of 30,000 yuan in alimony. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the First Special Court summoned Zhou Guansan, accompanied by lawyer Zhang Li, to the Fourth Civil Court. Lawyer Zhang stated that the defendant had filed a statement with the court today in response to the plaintiff's lawsuit, and filed a countersuit demanding a divorce. The lawyer also stated that the court had instructed him to advise both parties to reconcile, but this matter could not be carried out due to the bad relations between the two parties. Lawyer Le also stated that he had telegraphed Lawyer Zhang, asking the defendant to pay attention to the feelings of a decade of marriage and reconcile, but the reply was not only that reconciliation was impossible, but also that a countersuit would be filed, so no negotiations could be held. Judge Zhang then advised Zhou Guansan to reconcile, but Zhou stated that there was no possibility of reconciliation. The court believed that the defendant's countersuit was related to the plaintiff's lawsuit, and the defendant's countersuit had just been submitted today and had not been delivered to the plaintiff, so the case could not be debated today. It was ordered that the hearing be postponed to 3:30 pm one week later.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Chief Editor: In the local news section of your esteemed newspaper on October 5th, there was a report about Chang (mistakenly printed as Shang) Zhongxuan committing suicide by taking poison. Upon investigation, Chang Zhongxuan is the younger brother of Wen and others. He served Guangzhong well and was well-regarded by Bin Dong. This suicide attempt by our younger brother was purely due to unresolved marital problems. Wen and others blame themselves for not paying attention in advance, which led to this unfortunate event. Having read the report in your esteemed newspaper, it appears to be based on hearsay. Therefore, we specially request a correction. We wish you peace. Respectfully, Chang Wen, Chang Guoxia, together. October 5th. (Mailing address: 38 Shunzhi Lane, Kunming Road)</p>

<p>Date Set for December 16th</p>
<p>Route the Same as Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, the International Walking Race Association held its annual meeting at the Shanghai Engineering Association on Sichuan Road. Westerners Lee Ted, McKenna, Howatt, Ross, Izzet, and Chinese Shen Siliang, Shi Youhui, Zhou Yuyu, and others, as well as many other foreigners, attended the meeting. The outcome was unexpected. Many people had already made contact beforehand, leading to a chorus of agreement to stop holding the event. Our country had heard this news early on, so it strongly opposed the decision and insisted on continuing the event. However, the foreigners, given that no British people were participating and that the Chinese had won the championship for six consecutive sessions, made various excuses and refused to hold the event any longer, abandoning over thirty years of long history. This can be described as painful. After the meeting, American Howatt, British Ross, French Izzet, and Chinese Shi Youhui and others held an emergency meeting at 83 Central Road to discuss how to deal with the situation. They unanimously agreed to reorganize a Chinese-foreign committee, with an equal number of members from each side, to continue holding the event. The date was set for December 16th. The route will be the same as before. All Shanghai Chinese open walking races may be expanded to include international participants, and the scheduled date may be postponed. The Chinese Walking Race Association is scheduled to continue practicing the 13-mile race at 7:00 AM tomorrow. Those who wish to join should gather at the Tongfu Road intersection on time. Each competitor must hire their own lead runner to facilitate forward progress.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Municipal Stadium Preparing to Organize a Fun and Rich Ping Pong Competition <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal No. 1 Stadium is now preparing to organize the second ping pong competition. In addition to those whose profession is sports, all ping pong teams from all walks of life can register to participate. The registration period is from the 14th of this month to the 4th of next month. The method is quite different from ordinary ping pong competitions, as its purpose is purely to promote indoor sports and increase the interest of the participants. The main points are recorded below: (1) Each team registers 10 players (7 or more, less than 10 is also acceptable, each person cannot join two teams). Seven players will be on the court for the competition. When registering, the number of each player must be clearly indicated, and a six-inch photo of all players must be attached, also indicating the number. The first seven numbers are the official players, and the numbers below seven are the reserves. Each game will follow this numbering, from front to back, in order, and no other roster can be arranged to change the order in an attempt to win by skill. If an official player is absent due to an event, the reserve player's replacement must also follow the numbering, from front to back, without chaos. (2) Competition method: using the continuous capture system. The method depends on the number of participating teams, drawing lots to divide into several groups. Each group will conduct a single round-robin tournament. After the competition, the winning team will be given a championship. This is the first round of the competition. Then, the winning teams will withdraw, and the teams in each group will be mixed and re-drawed to form groups to hold the second round of the competition. The winning teams in each group will still be given championships. Then, the winning teams will withdraw, and the above method will be used to re-draw lots to form groups to hold the third round of the competition. The winning teams in each group will still be given championships. The number of rounds of competition depends on the number of participating teams. (3) Each individual competition will use the best-of-five format. In each game, the team with the most winning players wins. Each win earns one point. After each round of the competition, the team with the most points wins. If the scores of two teams are equal, another final will be required. If the scores of three or more teams are equal, the elimination competition method will be used to determine the championship. It is also heard that the competition date is from 6:00 PM every Monday to Friday, which does not interfere with the occupations of people from all walks of life. For details, you can ask the stadium to read the regulations.</p>
<p>Also, the small football competition at the stadium on October 10th, the game between Chunguang and Wheelock, will be held at 9:30 AM on the 7th (Sunday) in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Shandong Education Adopts New Reforms, Each County Middle School Sets Up Normal School <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Normal School Changed to Vocational School</p>
<p>Director of Education He Siyuan Enters Beijing to Ask for Instructions</p>
<p>Jinan Communication, In recent years, the province's 13 provincial middle schools, county middle schools, and private middle schools have established many more. After graduation, students cannot enter high school and achieve nothing, which is a pity. Now, the Shandong Provincial Department of Education is promoting survival education and compulsory education, and setting up normal schools and vocational schools, so that students can learn a skill to make a living after graduation, or serve as teachers in rural primary schools to eliminate illiteracy. It is intended to restrict these surplus county and private junior middle schools. The Ministry of Education has approved the change of each county's middle school to a normal school and the provincial normal school to a vocational school. Director of Education He Siyuan believed that this reform was very important, so he took the 305 train to Beijing this morning (the 3rd) to visit Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education to ask for instructions and discuss everything. The reporter met He on the train and asked about everything. According to him, he recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to reform the normal schools, middle schools, and vocational schools in the province, so he entered Beijing to ask for instructions. In addition, he also visited Dean Dai (Chuanxian) to discuss the restoration of the Confucius Temple in Qufu and the preferential treatment of Confucius' descendants. The restoration of the Confucius Temple is a huge project that requires a lot of money. Relying solely on donations will not help. There must be basic funds before one dares to start. Although the general methods for preferential treatment of Confucius' descendants have been drafted, they are also plagued by economic difficulties. All of these need to be discussed with Dean Dai to improve the methods. He is scheduled to return to Jinan from Beijing on the 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Liu Wendao's Speech at Jinan University: Six Meanings of Italian Revival <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Our country's ambassador to Italy, Mr. Liu Wendao, at 3 p.m. yesterday, at the invitation of the National Jinan University in Zhenru, came to the university to give a speech. Upon arrival, he was personally led by the university president, Shen Pengfei, to the Zhiyuan Hall of the university. More than a thousand students attended. The main points of his speech are recorded below. Mr. Liu first pointed out that since the European War, among the countries in Central Europe that have revived, there are Turkey, Italy, and Germany. Having been stationed in Germany for two years and in Italy for one year, I am relatively familiar with the political situation of the two countries. I feel that Italy was in extreme disorder before and after the European War, with frequent natural disasters and wars. The degree of internal and external troubles was worse than that of China today. However, since Mussolini seized power by force and used democracy to govern, he has won the sympathy of the people nationwide and astonished the world by looking down on everything. In fact, Mussolini's success, although not easy, also has an indelible spirit underlying it. The greatest banner, to warn and encourage people, is the Six Meanings: (1) Order: When Italy was in extreme turmoil, he saw clearly that the most important prerequisite was to calm people's hearts and restore the inherent order of the country. Therefore, his personal life and behavior were especially cautious in word and deed to set an example for the people. It is necessary to rectify one's own heart before one can cultivate oneself, manage one's family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world. Otherwise, if the father is not kind and the son is not filial, and one person implicates a family or a country, it is truly one person eating misfortune and a country causing chaos. Moreover, keeping order is not surrendering to someone, but cultivating civic habits and fulfilling national obligations; (2) Authority: After social stability, there is a need for authority everywhere. The so-called authority is not relying on bullying neighbors, but people being able to do their best, not fearing threats, and being loyal to their duties. It is difficult to say in China where the spirit of the rule of law has not been established, but it can be done in Italy, and it can be seen from a certain thing; (3) Justice; (4) Faith; (5) Obedience; (6) Struggle; These are the great meanings. In short, they are all a consistent policy with a chain-like nature. First, there must be order, then there will be authority. With authority, one can naturally uphold justice and gain people's faith. When the words are correct and things are in order, the world will follow the orders, and then one can talk about struggle, embracing a view of life that completes personality, until one has exhausted one’s efforts and dies. Finally, he explained in detail that revival lies in education, and he greatly encouraged the students of the university. The meeting ended at half past four.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Italian Far East Friendship Association Subsidizes Chinese Students Studying in Italy <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Two places are offered, and there is a great enthusiasm for applications.</p>
<p>The Italian Far East Friendship Association, in order to help students studying in Italy to connect and foster friendship between China and Italy, is willing to subsidize 5,000 lire (equivalent to more than 1,200 Chinese yuan) for qualified students studying in Italy. The details have been published in various newspapers. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency inquired about this from Mr. Lu Si, the person in charge of the association, yesterday. According to him, this motivation is purely to seek friendship between China and Italy and to help ambitious students studying in Italy. However, due to the economic relationship of this association, this small amount can only be a subsidy. Because few of the applicants are proficient in Italian, if they want to learn, it will take a year of effort, and the association's subsidy is only for one year. If they want to continue in the future, they still have to bear it themselves. Although English is common, it is actually not very convenient for studying, and the association only accepts two people, and the number is limited. It is said that there is a great enthusiasm for applications.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Comparative View of the Classification of New Vacuum Tubes <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes are increasing day by day, and there are many types. Comrades who like to make radios often have no way to choose. In fact, vacuum tubes commonly used in AC machines can be divided into two categories according to their filament voltage: 2.5v and 6.3v. Many of the characteristics of vacuum tubes between these two categories are quite similar or similar. Now, according to their structural characteristics, they are classified and compared.</p>
<p>(1) Triode: Starting with the triode, in the 2.5v category, there are 27 and 56, which can be equivalent to 37 and 76 in the 6.3v category. Except for the different filament voltage and current, the characteristics and functions of 56 and 76 are completely the same. As for 27 and 37, there are slight differences. The cathode of 37 is smaller, and its transconductance and screen current are also slightly weaker, but in actual design, the effect is completely regarded as the same.</p>
<p>(2) Double-Plate Triode (Diode_Priode): A double-plate triode is an ordinary triode with an additional pair of plates. In the 2.5v category, there are 55 and 2A6, and in the 5.3v category, there are 85 and 75, which can be equivalent to each other, and their characteristics are completely the same. The only difference between 55 and 2A6 is that the amplification coefficient of 55 is 8.3, while that of 2A6 is 100. Therefore, if a larger output power is required, it is advisable to use 2A6.</p>
<p>(3) Constant Power Tetrode and Pentode: The main task of this type of vacuum tube is the first and second detector tubes of the superheterodyne machine. In the 2.5v category, there are 24 and 57. In the 6.3v category, those that can be equivalent to them are 36, 6C6 and 77. 36 and 24 are tetrodes. Except that the cathode of 36 is smaller and the power consumption of the filament is weaker, other characteristics and effects are quite similar to 24; 57, 77, and 6C6 are all pentodes. There are many structural differences between 77 and 6C6, but the electrical characteristics are still completely consistent. For example, the internal isolation of 77 surrounds the plate, while the isolation of 6C6 is above the plate; Although the advantage of the internal isolation of 77 can reduce the isolation device of the radio, the output capacitance also increases at the same time, which is quite unfavorable for high-frequency circuits.</p>
<p>(4) Variable Power Tetrode and Pentode: This type of vacuum tube is most suitable for the high-frequency amplification or intermediate-frequency amplification stage of a radio. In the 2.5v category, there are fewer types, only 35 and 58. 35 is actually the same as 24, and 58 is similar to 57. The only difference is that the former has a variable power effect. In the 6.3v category, those that can be equivalent to it are 39, 44, 6D6, and 78. The variable power effect of is weaker than that of 35. Because 39 is specially designed for car radios, the intensity of its input signal is not as comparable to that of indoor radios equipped with large antennas. The characteristics of 78 are between 39 and 6D6, and 44 can be regarded as completely the same as 39 and can be interchanged. All of the above tubes, except 35, have a suppression grid and become pentodes.</p>
<p>(5) Special Vacuum Tube: Also known as Combination Tube, it is also a type of complex vacuum tube. In the 2.5v category, there are 2A7 and 2B7, and in the 5.3v category, there are 6A7 and 6B7, which are equivalent to them. 6A7 is often used as a frequency converter for superheterodyne machines, and there is another grid dedicated to oscillation, so there is no need to set up an oscillation tube. 2B7 and 6B7 are both double-plate pentodes. The double-plate can be used for detection, and the pentode part is suitable for audio frequency or intermediate frequency amplification.</p>
<p>(6) High-Power Output Tube: There are many types of high-power output tubes in the 2.5v category. 45, 2A3, and 46 are all filament triodes. 2A3 is better than 45 because it can output greater power and the distortion is extremely small. When 46 is used for Class A amplification, its output is smaller than 45. If it is used for Class B amplification, it is stronger than 45, but the distortion is greater than 2A3. 47 and 2A5 are pentode power amplifier tubes, and their characteristics are very similar, but the latter is a cathode type, which can greatly reduce AC noise. In this respect, it seems to be better than 47. In addition, there is No. 59, which has the effects of both 47 and 46. Because there are three grids connected to the outside of the tube, only the connection method of the circuit needs to be changed to suit a certain function. There are only three high-power output tubes in the 6.3v category: 42, 4I, and 89. The characteristics of 42 and 2A5 are the same, and the output of 4I is only slightly weaker. As for 39, it can be regarded as a small 59, because its characteristics and effects are mostly the same.</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Reason for Loud Screaming <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>Recently, a friend installed a three-tube radio. The vacuum tubes used were one 33 detector and two 30 low-frequency amplifiers. The whole machine, except for the battery, was installed in a beautiful wooden box. Unexpectedly, after installation, the screaming sound continued. Therefore, the primary PB of the low-frequency transformer was swapped, but the result was ineffective. Later, I suspected that the grid circuit and the plate circuit were connected in parallel. After careful inspection, I reconnected the suspicious places, and the problem was solved. However, when the radio was put into the box, it still screamed, but when it was taken out of the box, the screaming stopped. Therefore, I decided that the screaming must be related to the loudspeaker (because the loudspeaker was installed in the box). However, the loudspeaker was in the upper part of the box, and the radio was in the lower part of the box, and there was a considerable distance from the transformer, so the screaming would not be caused by the matching. After careful observation, I discovered the reason. It turned out that the wiring on the loudspeaker was too long and was not tied up, and it happened to fall on the grid capacitor and grid leak. Therefore, the plate circuit and the grid circuit produced screaming due to matching. At that time, I tied up the remaining wires on the loudspeaker (that is, the speaker wires), and the screaming was gone. Therefore, when we install the loudspeaker and the radio together, we must also pay attention to the wires on the loudspeaker.</p>
<h3 id="e224">DC Generator with Automatic Output Voltage Regulation <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>In a Class B amplifier, the grid voltage should not be supplied by the electrical source; because the fluctuating grid current flows back into the generator, it easily causes the power supply to change, and the grid voltage cannot be stabilized, resulting in poor operation. If you want to reduce its voltage change, there are only two methods: one is to connect a low-impedance shunt at the output; and the other is to keep the load constant. However, using a low-impedance shunt results in excessive power loss, which is too uneconomical; therefore, the second method should be discussed, which is to keep the load constant, and its change is almost zero.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, it is a DC generator with automatic output voltage regulation. The difference between it and an ordinary DC generator, in addition to the rectifier tube and filter device, is that it has a Regulation Vocuum_Tube, referred to as a regulation tube; and a self-grid resistor RI, whose value must be several million ohms, so that the regulation tube cuts off the plate current when there is no load. The output voltage is equal to the total voltage of the generator minus the voltage required for the regulation tube to have a cutoff plate current.</p>
<p>If this generator is used in a Class B amplifier to supply the grid voltage, the current flows back into the regulation tube, and the tube then has a grid current; therefore, the voltage passing through the regulation tube increases, and the voltage from the self-grid resistor RI decreases. The sum of the voltage drops between the regulation tube and the RI resistor must be equal to the total voltage of the power supply; Since the voltage of RI decreases, the grid voltage of the regulation tube decreases, which reduces the total plate impedance. The output voltage connected across it is controlled by this, and does not change with the load, so it can be kept constant.</p>
<p>If this device is used in a Class B amplifier to supply a stable plate voltage, its circuit is the same as the above-mentioned control grid voltage. However, the RI value is reduced so that the current passing through the regulation tube when there is no external load is exactly twice the highest average load current.</p>
<p>When an external load is connected, the current passing through the self-grid resistor RI increases. Since the grid voltage of the regulation tube increases, the plate current decreases; therefore, the external load current can be increased. One decrease and one increase cancel each other out, so that the output voltage can be kept constant.</p>

<h3 id="e225">A Simple Method for Grounding <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>One day, a classmate, Wu Jun, asked me to install an antenna and ground wire for him. He was a boarder and had obtained permission from the school authorities, so he installed an antenna (about 75 feet long) on the balcony of the three-story building. After the antenna was installed, he had to install the ground wire. However, the tap was far away from the dormitory (also far away from the lead pipe of the tap). The iron bars were also damaged by the students. I happened to see a big tree outside the window. The branches were very close to the window. I had a whim and thought that the tree had conductivity. So I tied a copper wire to the branch and connected it to the radio for listening. The result was indeed good. So today I write it out for your reference.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Alsea's Latest Invention: Shortwave Antenna <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the sales of shortwave radios have become increasingly popular. In order to eliminate noise and increase efficiency, radio listeners in all sectors attach great importance to the improvement of antennas. In view of this, Alsea Victory Company specially conducted in-depth research by its experienced technicians and invented a new type of home antenna, called "Alsea's Latest Antenna." It can receive radio waves from the sea, land, and air. The installation is simple and can be used in every household. The method uses a double-crossover wire equipment. The efficiency of receiving long and short wave radio signals is several times higher than that of ordinary antennas. Even if the lead-in wire of the radio is more than 500 feet long, the receiving efficiency is still not reduced. It can also avoid the noise generated by this lead-in wire. A switch is installed inside the radio, which is specially used to change the reception of broadcast and shortwave programs. Therefore, after all long and short wave radios are retrofitted with this new Alsea antenna, the receiving performance will definitely be improved. The performance of old-fashioned shortwave radios with adapters is also good when using this antenna. In addition, if the roof area is too small to install a long enough antenna, you can also retrofit this new type of antenna, and you can get the same effect.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Entering Trade into the Folk, Returning to Yongshou, Leaving Home, and Arriving in Chang'an</p>
<p>The girl bit her four front teeth on her sleeve, and just looked at the ground with her head down. Jia Duocai suddenly changed his mind, it was all his fault. Since he admired this girl very much, how could he make her too embarrassed? So he said to the old woman: Since you have also arrived in Xi'an, that's very good. You can always think of a way slowly. Where do you live? The middle-aged woman glanced at Jia Duocai and took a step back, clearly having something to say, but suddenly she was shy and endured it back. It was the old woman who saw that this old master was not unintentional, so she interjected: This child's father is there, we have not received any information. This child's uncle has also gone there, but the aunt is here, and we live there. This child's aunt took us out to see, we felt like we had arrived in the Heavenly Palace, and we were reluctant to go back, so she left first. Now we are in trouble, not knowing how to go home. Jia Duocai said: Where do your relatives live? I'll take you back. The old woman supported the trunk of the tree and thought with her head raised: What alley? The middle-aged woman shook her head at her and said: No! I remember it's in Heaven. Jia Li and the two couldn't help but laugh. The middle-aged woman blushed and smiled: No, no, it's something-Heaven behind. The girl couldn't bear it any longer, so she turned her head and glared at them and said: Your memories are really bad, isn't it No. 8 Wangjia Alley behind Little Western Paradise? You don't even remember this little thing, what people are you looking for? Jia Duocai said: That's great, we live in Little Western Paradise, we'll lead you back along the way. The two women didn't say yes or no, but just took two steps back, meaning to let Jia Li and the two move forward. Jia Duocai nodded and said: Follow me. (34)</p>
<h3 id="e228">Wang Renqiu's Shanghai Observations <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Forty-five years ago, during the Guangxu fifteenth year, the writer Wang Renqiu was going to Tianjin to see Li Hongzhang, and he passed through Shanghai. (At that time, the Beijing-Hankou Railway had not yet been built, but there were already steamships sailing in the Yangtze River, so he took a detour to Shanghai.) He stayed for several days. Looking at his diary, there are a few things that can show what kind of ideas the old gentleman had about Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Arrived at Dan Gui Yuan, the lantern show was quite elaborate and lively." The previous day he had already been to Tianxian Yuan to watch a show, and later he went there again, which shows that he was a hedonist, and also that he was an outsider, so he only appreciated their craft and liveliness, unlike Luo Yinggong and Li Shikan, who had insider views all their lives.</p>
<p>"Jin Jie came to speak of the evils of compradors, saying that scholars and merchants cannot be friends, let alone compradors, who are barbarian slaves, and scholars associate with them, which is very contrary to propriety. This statement agrees with me, but it does not agree with the current situation." Because someone invited Wang Renqiu to accompany a steamship comprador for dinner during the day, he did not go. This argument is ridiculously pedantic. Which scholar did not associate with compradors later? But the old gentleman was still clear-headed, saying that it did not agree with the current situation, which was a cut above Mr. Jin Jie.</p>
<p>"Entered the New North Gate to the City God Temple... Exited the city to see the Big Self-Ringing Bell, then left and returned. The streets and houses in Shanghai are narrow and dark, still showing the system of a remote and desolate county, and there are also many people in the city, not knowing where to accommodate them?" This is what he meant regarding the inner city of Shanghai. At that time, it was indeed very "narrow and dark," but he wondered how so many people could make a living? He was indeed a person who cared about people's livelihood. If he took the train to Shanghai now, and saw the many luxurious hotels, he would be even more surprised where so many big spenders came from!</p>
<p>"The storyteller and nine prostitutes sang six songs in the library, spending 200 copper coins, which seemed very cheap. No game is so inexpensive for the wealthy." It was probably the female storytellers on the Four Horses Road. Their living standards were only like this more than forty years ago. Even the Qinglian Pavilion now only costs two dimes. How could Mr. Wang already think it was incredibly cheap?</p>
<p>Although these things are very trivial, there have been many changes in the meantime. If you tell them to the young people now, they will already think they are strange tales. If you flip through today's chronicles in a few decades, I'm afraid they will be regarded as ancient historical materials, right?</p>

<p>— (Hanyu)</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, I went up Gushan, preparing to go to the final resting place of Master Manshu, but I didn't know the way. So I asked a passerby: "Where is Su Manshu's tomb?" But they led me to Su Xiaoxiao's tomb. Unexpectedly, because of the promotion by literati since ancient times, courtesans can be famous for thousands of years. There are many literati, but no one commemorates or knows them.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Toilet Literature <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Fufan</p>
<p>Anyone who sees this topic will definitely think that I am linking "toilet" and "literature" together, insulting the dignity of literature and provoking the resentment of writers. But I don't care about these things at all. The dignity of literature and the lofty status of writers cannot prevent the existence of toilet literature. Look at all the schools now, as long as there are toilets, which one is not painted all over with dazzling colors, a truly magnificent sight?</p>
<p>We know that a certain kind of literature always has a certain style and flavor, but the toilet literature in schools has undergone a thorough liberation. You can write whatever you want, without any system or external constraints. Inside, it contains the eight-legged essay passed down from our ancestors, as well as the new poems that modern people must learn; there are concise plans for national salvation, and vivid anti-Japanese slogans; there are monthly evaluations of empresses and young ladies, and romantic histories of young masters; there are declining and gorgeous love letters, and interesting stories from mulberry fields and paths; there are vulgar and disgusting nicknames from the countryside, and terms commonly used by Dr. Zhang Jingsheng; there are funny game sketches, and humorous satirical texts; there are records of the merits and demerits of the principals and faculty, and complimentary and derogatory words for celebrities and big shots; there are unheard-of secret messages, and unseen novel theories; there are stimulating books, and riddles that are difficult to solve; there is pointed philosophy, and the art of scolding people. ... There is ...</p>
<p>Someone said: "The toilet is a natural and truthful opinion box for students." I think this is correct, so I now have a suggestion, which is that educators who want to examine a school should start from the hidden places. It is best to lower their status and inspect the toilets once. Then, regarding the students' grades, thoughts, and opinions in the school, they can get a concise outline.</p>

<p>At dusk, the setting sun was as red as blood, dyeing half the sky, like a girl's light drink, with a delicate blush on her cheeks; far away, it set off a few clusters of green trees, making it feel particularly lovely. From here, the chirping of sparrows could be heard. Occasionally, one or two would rush out of the treetops and fly away very quickly.</p>
<p>The leaves of poplars and Chinese parasol trees could not withstand the repeated wind and rain, and they all left the branches, danced in the air, and scattered on the roadsides around them. Stepping forward on these fallen leaves made a subtle sound. Looking up at the blue sky, a lone goose carried a mournful cry, and with a lonely heart, slowly flew to its resting place. A faint horn sound was carried by the wind into the eardrum, stirring up my indescribable melancholy. How could a wandering wanderer, with a heart full of wounds, endure the assault of this weeping reed pipe sound?</p>
<p>The reeds by the pool spit out white flowers, trembling in the wind, thin and pitiful. In front, under the fence, one or two remaining flowers could be seen, adorning this desolate countryside.</p>
<p>This area is full of sheep intestines-like paths, without the rumbling of cars disturbing the clear air; nor are there the footprints of enchanting women imprinted on this fragrant soil. At the time when smoke is rising from the cooking stoves, there are only farmers shouldering iron hoes, singing casually, happily walking home with big steps.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Luoyang Exotic Flavor Records (Part 1) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>Luodian, also known as Luoxi, or Luoyang, my hometown, is the first town under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. This town is located in the western countryside, bordering Jiading County. The feng shui is clear and beautiful, the customs are simple and beautiful, outstanding people are born from time to time, and it is also rich in natural resources. Just talking about the food, Luodian has many delicious things that are not available elsewhere. When the west wind rises, I can't help but think of perch soup and minced perch. I will talk about the flavors of my hometown here, tirelessly and as if enumerating family treasures. If any gourmand is greatly moved by this, he can immediately go to the Sun Temple in northern Shanghai, take the Shanghai-Tai long-distance bus, and arrive in Luodian in less than an hour to taste the exotic flavors in person, and take a tour of the town. It is also a pleasure. Now, Sun Zhang Danshi and other village elders are planning to build Luoyang Park. I have also been promoted as a sponsor. When the park is completed in the near future, Shanghai people will be able to go there for a short trip to clear their minds, eat their fill, and return home even more happily! Luodian's food is simply too beautiful to take in. Let me list a few things to serve as a little drool-inducing material:</p>
<p>1.  Tea Dish Category</p>
<p>Braised Mutton The tea dishes listed here are those that Luodian families are good at cooking in their daily lives. The wonderful thing about their braised mutton is that it is not fishy or gamey at all. The cooking is done to the point where the meat is crispy but not mushy, the soup is thick and sticky, and the taste is rich, fresh, and sweet! The dishes of families in the western countryside, such as the Sukun area, are inherently sweet, and the sweetness of Luodian's braised mutton is exactly what is needed to this degree, without being considered too sweet. When a bowl of steaming braised mutton is brought in from the door of the dining room, you can smell a sweet fragrance from afar, which makes your appetite open and your appetite boosted! There was a cook next door to my house named A Xiangbao, who was best at making this dish.</p>
<p>Clear Soup Fish Balls Fish balls are available everywhere, but the fish balls made by Luodian people are said to contain eggs, yams, and other special ingredients, so they are particularly delicious. They are more tender than tender tofu, and they melt in your mouth. They also have a particularly clean white color and a clear soup with no impurities, which cannot be matched by those made elsewhere. People find them lovely to look at. This is truly an edible beauty, matching the sentence used to describe a lustful person seeing a beautiful woman in front of him: "I can't wait to swallow him in one gulp!" This clear soup fish ball can make a person eat several bowls without getting tired of it.</p>
<p>Braised Sea Eel This sea eel is also called "Baijie" (I don't know if the character "jie" is written this way), and also called "sea eel rat," because it is transformed from a water rat, people say. This kind of fish is only abundant in the western countryside and is not easy to buy in Shanghai or elsewhere. Its advantage is that it has a lot of meat, and the skin and its nearby parts and head are very fatty, especially the cheeks. People who love to eat sea eel love its fat the most. This sea eel is usually braised at home, and it also has its own advantages when cooked white at banquets. This spring, I happened to participate in the Baoshan County civil servants' get-together (?) held in Luodian, and I ate the cheek pieces of white-braised large sea eel at that table, and I sighed at its fat and richness and its worth of praise! (The pronunciation of this fish's name is like "hui". I don't know if the character "eel" is wrong. I haven't had time to check it. Please correct me.)</p>
<p>Smoked Crucian Carp and Smoked Field Chicken The rivers in the western countryside are stagnant water, clear to the bottom, and the fish, shrimp, and aquatic creatures produced are easy to be huge, and the taste is also particularly fresh. The rather large crucian carp is even more fragrant and appetizing after smoking. It must go through the process of frying in oil, so that the fine bones can be eaten together, avoiding the trouble of picking bones. Smoked crucian carp is cooked at home, but the flavor is better than the smoked herring sold in all the tea shops by an unknown amount. As for smoked field chicken, there are street vendors selling it, large in shape and fine in meat; there are also smoked field chicken lungs that can be bought in piles, the delicacy of which can only be compared to chicken tongue, and it would be a shame to eat them all in one breath. Although smoked field chicken and field chicken lungs are not included in formal banquets, they are very suitable for accompanying wine.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Records of the Fleeting Fragrance of the Imperial Scent <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the past, we always found it very difficult to see many trees next to any river; the reason was that Chinese people have always not known how to pay attention to the construction of gardens. Ordinary poor people, because they have no money to buy fuel, compete to cut down trees everywhere, so that except for very remote areas, such as Jilin, Heilongjiang, etc., there are almost no forests in the mainland of China; even rows of trees are rare. But on the left and right of this long river, there are very neat rows of trees planted; drooping down like clusters of green threads, the willows gently fluttered on the water, and in the middle came peach blossoms blooming like red brocade, this scene was truly lovely.</p>
<p>When the Empress Dowager saw such a beautiful scenery, how could she let it go lightly? She insisted on ordering the car to stop so that she could get out of the car and take a small walk. Of course, no one could dissuade her will, so this yellow train stopped in the middle of the road. Everyone on the train who had duties had to follow her down. But getting out of the car did not mean free movement; only the Empress Dowager and a few of us female attendants could walk around at will. After standing upright on the train for a long time, this kind of slight exercise was really necessary. Because the rest of the people had to stand respectfully to the Empress Dowager according to the original rules of the palace; however, those eunuchs could also run back and forth. Eunuchs could not be regarded as people, so they could be allowed to be free. Only those accompanying ministers suffered, standing like clay sculptures and wood carvings, their eyes unable to look around, but must always look at the Empress Dowager, so that when the Empress Dowager had something to say to someone, this person could immediately walk up.

<h3 id="e235">The Financial Situation Lingers Without Special Changes, and the Standard Gold Price Rises Another 2.6 Yuan <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday presented a lingering state. It was weak at first and then firm, lacking special disturbances. The overall trend of the day was even and mediocre. In the early morning, the overseas silver market shrank in both England and the United States, and the London raw gold fell by 1.5 pence. The exchange rate shrank slightly, the US prices rose slightly, and the stocks rose and fell slightly. The Associated Press reported that the US Chamber of Commerce opposed the establishment of a central bank and still supported the Federal Reserve System. This move contained the nature of a stable dollar, but at the same time, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said that it was not yet time to stabilize the gold pound, which made people feel flustered. The outside trading market initially traded at 31.2 yuan, and a selling spree suddenly arose, falling to 27.8 yuan. After the opening, it was flat and weak, and the banks were still taking it in. There were also buyers taking advantage of the situation, and it was pulled up. However, because the HSBC bank's listing was lengthened, there was still a struggle. The people's minds were stable, and although it rose to more than 30 yuan, the banks' appetites turned out to be stuffed out, the domestic market hardened, and the overall trend was still weak. There was a lot of hovering in the middle. It seemed that the chips on the table were dry, so although it fell, it was still able to maintain. The struggle was particularly fierce. When it rebounded to more than 30 yuan, there was suddenly a rumor in the market that our country was planning to reduce the fineness of silver coins. The buying spree arose, and the rise was also rapid, but there was some supply at the high price. Although the Guangdong bank entered, it tended to hover again. The exchange rate situation was normal. At noon, it was firm and then flat again. In the afternoon, the rumor of the morning became more prevalent, and the big players frantically grabbed exchange bills, making the situation even more tense. The opening trend was high, and after the opening, the exchange rate was even tighter and rose again. The Guangdong bank sold the notes and fell slightly. When the Bombay telegraph reported that it was rising by 7.7.7 annas, the selling spree arose slightly, and the work was completed downstream. After entering, the overall trend suddenly became stagnant. There were not many transactions in the market, and the exchange rate was also flat. After the low, it presented a boring situation for a long time. The Guangdong bank still sold slightly. There were not many buyers in the market and it was low again, but after the low, the Guangdong bank chased and bought again. Finally, the market situation recovered steadily. As for the new December futures trading, the turnover was limited. It was mostly a swap between the two sides. The difference between the November and December periods was about a few jiao higher for the buyer. The market situation was mediocre throughout the day. Even if there were rumors that were unfavorable to short positions, the overall situation was not as panicked as in the previous few days. The office has already announced in writing the transfer procedures and the revised rules. Now I will record the market situation of the day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 928.6 yuan, down 1.6 yuan from the previous closing. The exchange rate opened at a recent selling price of 1 shilling 5 and 4375/10000 pence, and half a pence, and the US exchange rate was 35.9375 yuan. Citibank stuffed the November US dollar at 36 yuan. Fuxing Yong Yuanchun sold the note, and it fell to 6.6 yuan. Fuxing Yongda, Fayongheng, Yufu, Yuzhaofeng, Changlaijin, Huabi grabbed the December US dollar at 0.0625, and it rose to 30 yuan. It was learned in advance that HSBC's listing rose by 125 for English and 25 for American. Yuanchun Zhaofengchang sold to 27.7 yuan, and then corrected that the US dollar only rose by 0.01875. Hengyu Hongxing Yicheng Dingchang Yongfeng Dingkang Jin Tiao, and then rose to 30.06 yuan. Dadecheng Ruikang Fuxing Yongqing Yu Yuanchang Yong got rid of it and gradually went downstream. Huabi came out with the December US dollar at 0.0625, and retreated to 28.2 yuan. Hengyu Fuyu took advantage of the low to enter the note, and it recovered by 1 yuan, but because the domestic market suddenly loosened, Maccallum stuffed the December US dollar at 0.0125. Fuan Yuanchang Yong and others sold again, and it fell back to 6.5 yuan. The people's minds were still stable. Dadecheng Yicheng Fuan Dafayong Huixiang Hengchang Yong Fuxing Yong took advantage of the low to buy in. Zhenjin grabbed the January shilling at 0.0625, and it rose to 30.05 yuan. Citibank came out with the October US dollar at 36 yuan, and it still retreated to within 30 yuan. Huabi restuffed the February US dollar at 0.0125. Yuanyi Dafayong Dadecheng got rid of it, and it fell to 8 yuan. Shunmao Fuxing Yong Yuanyi Dadecheng Hengyu successively purchased, and it rose to more than 30 yuan, and a buying spree arose. It was suddenly rumored in the market that our country would reduce the fineness of silver coins. Hengyu Dadecheng Qianchangxiang Hengxing frantically entered, and it rose to 33.5 yuan. Yuansheng Yong Yuanfeng Yong Fuan took advantage of the high price to get rid of it, and it fell to within 2 yuan. Hengxing Fuxing Yong Hengxingyuan entered again, and it rose to 3 yuan again. Dafayong Fuchang Fuan sold again and it fell to 1 yuan. The noon closing was 931.5 yuan. Hengxing came up and bought it frantically. The after-market closing was flat.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 934.7 yuan, because it was affected by the rumors from the morning, and Dadecheng and others tried hard to grab exchange bills. Hengxing came to sell, and it retreated from 5 yuan to 3.7 yuan. Ruikang Dadecheng Shunmao She Fuxing Yong Hengyu competed to buy. The bank was doing the January US dollar at 36 yuan, and it rose to 6 yuan. Shengda Hengxing sold and entered again, but there were many struggles. When Bombay rose by 7 annas, Shunmao Yicheng Dadecheng Dafayong Yuanmaoyong Dalian Bang Fuyu sold the notes, and it immediately retreated to 2.3 yuan. Hengyu Huixiang Yuanchang Yong Yuanfeng Yong Ruikang and others took advantage of the low price to take in the notes. Although the bank stuffed them, they gradually rose to 3.9 yuan. Hengxing limited the market and did not get rid of them. Shangchang jointly sold them, and they fell to 1.5 yuan. Shengda Hengxing Fuchang suddenly had a buying appetite, and the closing price rose to 932.8 yuan again. After the closing, Shengda suddenly had a selling appetite, and it turned from stable to flat. It was found that the highest price of the day was 936 yuan and the lowest price was 926.5 yuan, with a difference of 9.5 yuan. As a result, it rose another 2.6 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The new standard for the November period also retreated to 926.6 yuan in the morning opening. There were not many transactions. Shenyu and Wanxing did 70 notes for 8 yuan, which was half a yuan different from the November period. By noon, the closing was 31.5 yuan. The after-market opened at 34.7 yuan, lacking transactions. It was extended to the closing price of 932.8 yuan, which was also up 2.6 yuan from the previous closing. The new number of December chips increased to 2,961 notes, with a total of 14 long positions and 15 short positions.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 35.6875 yuan based on HSBC's US exchange rate listing rising by 0.01875, which was equivalent to a standard gold price of 969 yuan and zero. According to the closing price, it was about 37 yuan, which was about 7 yuan less than the previous closing. The settlement price of the new December standard was 964.2 yuan based on the standard gold price listed by the Central Bank. According to the closing price, it was about 31 yuan, which was about 3 yuan more than the previous closing. The registration price for this month was 932 yuan, the same price for November, and the same price for December. The morning water supplement was 932 yuan, and the afternoon water supplement was 933 yuan. The pure gold price was increased by 10 yuan, and the listing was 938.6 yuan. There was still a lack of large amounts in the market. The transaction water addition was similar to the previous day, and the buying sentiment was extremely weak. There were few October notes left after the public order was collected and released on the same day. Only 49 notes were left.</p>
<p>The transactions in the market were chaotic. In summary, Hengyu Yuanxing Shunmao Hengxing Yuan Dadecheng Fuxing Zhengchang Hongkang Yong Yongli Wanxing Shunli, etc. were on the buying side. Dachangxiang Fuyu Daxing Yong Yuan Kangxiang Fuchang Tianfeng Yong Huiyuan Yingxiang Yuanchun Chunyuan Yongshen Changyong, etc. were on the selling side. Hongxing Futai Hengyu Qingyong Yifeng Yongshengda Hengxing, etc. entered first and then exited. Dafayong Tongchun Fuxingyong Yuanmaoyong Huixiang exited first and then entered. Dalian Bang and Wanxing did a total of more than 1,600 notes, squeezing in about 300. Shunli did a total of more than 900 notes, squeezing in dozens. Guangdong Gang Shengda entered and exited 200 to 300 each. Hengxing entered more than 500 and exited more than 300. The total number of transactions on the day was 44,723 in the morning and 24,458 in the afternoon. The total number in November was 29,330, with a total of 55 long positions and 59 short positions.</p>
<p>The public orders released on the day were 105 from Shenkang and 7 from Yingfengheng. The ones collected were 70 from Fuchang and 14 each from Yuanyi Wanxing Dadecheng, totaling 112. The settlement price for collection and release was 932 yuan.</p>

Article 47 For fixed-term sales and purchases, if the goods are not delivered by the end date, the settlement shall be based on the standard gold listing price listed by the Central Bank on the same day. The above-mentioned standard gold price is calculated based on the Central Bank's customs gold unit listing on the same day, which is based on the London pure gold price calculated according to the Central Bank's shilling listing (Shanghai 978 fineness market average gold ten taels (that is, one note) equals London pure gold 9.82607 ounces). In addition to the December transactions that have been done since September 17, all established fixed-term sales and purchases shall be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned article when the December period is transferred on the 15th of this month. If there is no transfer and cash is available for payment, the delivery shall be made in accordance with the regulations. In the event that the goods are not delivered by the end date, the old regulations shall still be followed.</p>
<p>The calculation method of the standard gold price of the Central Bank is as follows:</p>
<p>The pure gold price in London today is 142 shillings and 1 pence, converting pence to 1.705 pence. Each market average gold ten taels (978 fineness) is equal to London pure gold 9.82607 ounces. Multiply 9.82607 by 1.705, which equals 16.753.4 pence. The Central Bank's listing today is 1 shilling and 5 pence and 375/10000, which equals 17 pence and 375/10000. Divide 16.753.4 by 17.375, which equals a standard gold price of 964.2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Dull Foreign Exchange Market Situation <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, the London large transaction and Bank of America both decreased by 125. London raw gold decreased by 1.5 pence. Sterling against the US dollar decreased by 625, the US dollar against Sterling decreased by 125. Sterling against the French Franc fell by 13 pounds, and the US dollar against the French Franc increased by 75. A foreign dispatch stated that the American Chamber of Commerce opposed the idea of establishing a central bank to manage the currency system. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price at one shilling five pence four three seven five and a half pence against the cable. The US dollar was at 35.9375 yuan, which was a slight decrease compared to the previous close, with Sterling down 0.0625 and the US dollar up 0.125, because the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, [Neville] Chamberlain, indicated that stabilizing the gold standard was not yet the right time. After the opening, the market was flat. Subsequently, with the listing by HSBC, Sterling increased by 0.125, and the US dollar increased by 0.1875. The bank had further selling interest, and the process seemed loose, but there was a lot of fluctuation. Later, rumors that our country would reduce the silver content of its currency caused a potential tightening, but it was still ordinary. In the afternoon market, Chinese merchants entered and made up for their positions, causing a sudden tightening. However, because banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, coupled with reports from Bombay indicating an increase of 7 annas, the process loosened again, eventually leading to a sluggish situation. At closing, the near-term selling price was one shilling five pence four three seven five for Sterling and 35.8125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the previous close, both Sterling and US dollar showed uncertainty. American firms sold approximately US$500,000, and also sold a small amount of gold. Banks still had selling interest. Overall, the situation was dull. Today, the day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Slight Interest Rate and Simple Clearance <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation was relatively simple. Due to the fifth day of the lunar month, the amount of clearance at Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) increased more than usual. However, the amount of clearance at the modern banks was still limited, even more quiet than the past few days, due to the continuous rainy weather, which hindered the smooth flow of goods. The market interest rate was the same for both the morning and afternoon sessions, at 1.2%, with no increase in rate for extensions. The transaction volume of short-term bills was over 3.1 million in the morning session, over 700,000 in new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon session, and over 400,000 in transactions within the small association. The amount of foreign exchange collateral transactions for redemption was over 500,000 and over 900,000 in new transactions. The amount of banknotes recovered was over 700,000 and the amount issued was over 600,000, with customer sources and destinations each accounting for 200,000. Bank clearance: Foreign banks cleared over 2.4 million in bills, over 3.6 million in various goods, foreign exchange collateral, and miscellaneous items, and over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlement, with 300,000 in withdrawals. Chinese banks cleared over 2.0 million in bills, over 5.1 million in various goods, foreign exchange tax collateral, and miscellaneous items, and over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlement, with 300,000 in withdrawals.

<h3 id="e239">Rumors Trigger Bond Market Decline <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Far-term "Regular Six" Bonds Drop One Yuan and One Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange experienced sudden market fluctuations. Initially, the market was weak and listless. In the afternoon session, rumors arose, causing unnecessary panic. The rampant activities of bandits in Sichuan province seemed undeniable. The news from the exchange only surfaced in the afternoon session. Many blindly followed, swayed by the tide without understanding the underlying reasons, and sold off their holdings. Such individuals are easily deceived. Even if there is a small upside in the future, the rebound will be limited. It is advisable to exercise caution. The overall trend yesterday was mainly downward. The market opening in the morning saw mixed gains and losses, with more declines than gains, but the magnitude was minimal. Only the No. 11 counter saw more buying activity. In the second session, prices continued to decline by two or three jiao uniformly. Most of the selling came from retail investors. The afternoon opening continued the decline of two or three jiao in the previous session. After the salt tax, the market rebounded by about one jiao, but remained chaotic and fluctuating. At the close, rumors suddenly surfaced, causing many to sell off their holdings without understanding the situation. The No. 78 counter saw the most aggressive selling. The sellers were mostly out-of-town investors. The floor traders, already holding short positions, took advantage of the opportunity to amplify the trend, leading to an irrational sell-off. Initially, the decline was minimal, but it intensified, with the far-term "Regular Six" bonds dropping by one yuan and one jiao, demonstrating the intentions of the floor traders. Given this, there is likely to be another wave of fluctuations in the future. The market results showed declines ranging from two or three jiao to two yuan and a half, almost entirely occurring during the closing session. The total turnover was 9,635,000 yuan. The following is a comparative table showing the results of the increases and decreases (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from the American-Feng Company, yesterday (the 4th) in the New York stock market, the sharp drop in the stock of the California Company caused confusion. The potential election of [Upton] Sinclair prompted speculators to take short positions. However, the pressure dissipated before the close, and most stocks rebounded. The bond market was mixed and slightly lower. US government bonds were firm due to purchases by banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. Small exchange stocks tended to decline. Chicago wheat rebounded due to large transactions of flour in the East and Southwest. The total daily turnover was 610,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>|                       | 3rd    | 4th    | Fluctuation |</p>

<p>The fluctuation of spot yarn is uncertain.</p>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, but the sales of spot yarn have become increasingly sluggish, and the selling prices are declining. Due to long-term stockpiles, manufacturers have reduced prices to seek sales, causing market anxiety. However, the continuous decline in recent days has prompted some to offset their losses with profits, stabilizing the market somewhat. Nevertheless, foreign short positions have not yet been covered.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Forward Yarn: Near-Term Decline, Far-Term Increase <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, profits were taken, stabilizing the market slightly. After the second and third sessions, the market turned weak again. As spot yarn prices were relatively low, with 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn selling for 177 yuan including tax, and 20-count Globe yarn priced at 176.5 yuan including tax, the price of spot yarn for this month was still higher than spot yarn. A decline began, with all months falling by 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao. The market remained weak at the afternoon opening. It was reported that spot yarn transactions were sluggish. After the second and third sessions, prices rebounded due to rising cotton prices. However, at closing, manufacturers sold off far-term contracts, causing prices to fall again. As a result, all months increased by 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao. The total daily turnover was 59,200 bales. Sales included 3,800 bales from Tongfu, 1,450 bales from Tongji, 4,550 bales from Dafeng, 1,650 bales from Daji, 550 bales from Jinchang, 950 bales from Huikang, 500 bales from Yuande, 800 bales from Xiecheng, 2,850 bales from Dachang, 750 bales from Mingde, and 800 bales from Deji. Purchases included 750 bales from Shenji, 950 bales from Shenyu, 1,850 bales from Dafu, 2,050 bales from Gengfeng, 1,000 bales from Shenchang, 1,000 bales from Ruida, 1,950 bales from Taichang, 2,550 bales from Changbai, 1,100 bales from Xincheng, 2,700 bales from Renfeng, and 1,000 bales from Xiecheng. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales remain weak. The total purchases by all groups for the day were 495 bales, with prices falling by 0.5 to 1 yuan. The purchases by each group are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon because the bulls maintained their positions and did not release them. Also, there was not much inventory in the warehouses, so it was easy to rebound slightly. However, the situation in the American cotton market remained weak. Another view was that the arrival of goods from various regions was not large.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Zheng Spot: Morning Decline, Afternoon Rebound <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, due to the slight decline in US cotton, there were not many buyers, and all months fell by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the market suddenly tightened because some people predicted that US cotton might rebound. Short covering and bull price increases resulted in all months rising by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The total daily turnover was 113,600 dan. Sales included 3,500 dan from Hongchang, 1,000 dan from Hexing, 1,000 dan from Jinchang, 1,900 dan from Yuanda, 6,200 dan from Changhe, 5,100 dan from Yuanxingchang, 1,500 dan from Xiesheng, 1,400 dan from Dachang, 2,500 dan from Xiesheng, 3,700 dan from Tongji, 3,800 dan from Hengyi, 1,200 dan from Suilong, and 1,200 dan from Dafu.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices were mixed due to anticipation of the government report. Prices initially weakened due to selling by foreign firms, but then rebounded due to short covering. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices rose or fell by 2 to 4 points. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 6 points. Indian cotton weakened due to bull liquidation and speculative selling. As a result, Pingguoer fell by 1.5 rupees, and Omu La and Bairo Creek fell by 2.25 rupees.

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a trend of rising first and then falling in various months. As the quoted prices for foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada both rebounded by about 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, the opening price reflected the improved sentiment of both insiders and outsiders. Northern merchants were already conducting business transactions, so the opening price for the current month was about 0.03 yuan higher, and the forward price was 0.04 to 0.05 yuan higher. However, by the second session, various factories were selling off their holdings, and as there were many floating positions in the market, they took the opportunity to dispose of them. The market sentiment for various months saw a decline, and the momentum was quite strong. By the fourth session, the price had fallen by 0.02 to 0.04 yuan compared to the initial opening. At the afternoon opening, the current month was initially very flat, but then, as the Northern merchants continued to do business, the near and far terms were active, and the factories remained on the sidelines, causing the market to improve, reversing the weak trend. Judging from the activity of the Northern merchants, the market is likely to improve later. As a result, the current month rose by 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, November rose by 0.02 yuan, December rose by 0.03 yuan, January rose by 0.0325 yuan, and February rose by 0.0225 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Futures Wheat Fluctuation Unpredictable <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Ultimately Driven Higher by Flour Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in both the morning and afternoon sessions, showed unpredictable fluctuations in various months. In the end, the outlook turned positive. At the morning opening, as foreign wheat prices were about 0.4 to 0.5 yuan higher, the sentiment among industry insiders was naturally optimistic. The opening price was about 0.02 to 0.03 yuan higher compared to the previous day. Subsequently, as the flour market rose and then softened, market sentiment weakened, and prices fell back. At the afternoon opening, the near and far term markets remained sluggish. Later, as the flour market rebounded, prices gradually rose. Currently, the central force in the wheat market is the flour market, so the prosperity or decline of the market depends on flour sales. However, based on the past few months, the ordering of foreign wheat is inevitable. If the market price is too high, it will directly or indirectly open the door for foreign wheat. As a result, the current month rose by 0.06 yuan, November rose by 0.08 yuan, and December and January each rose by 0.06 yuan. The spot wheat market, which had been stagnant for many days, saw a slight upturn yesterday. Prices fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The opening price for Shandong Xuzhou Bengbu wheat was 3.32 yuan, with 2,000 bales purchased by Xinda.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign rice production prices rebounded and the market sentiment was rising. Futures speculators were unwilling to release their holdings, and prices rose by 0.05 yuan. Although spot foreign rice had arrived, domestic sales were active. After the prices of spot and futures rice/paddy rose yesterday, the market also stabilized. Tongyi (company name) shipped 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice to Jiujiang and 1,200 bags to the local market. High-quality goods opened at 10.06 yuan, medium-quality goods at 10.034 to 10.015 yuan. The local market also shipped 100 bags of small glutinous rice and 58 bags of Annam Japonica rice. The recent arrival of spot rice/paddy has been limited, while domestic sales have been active. Yesterday, 908 bags of processed rice and 1,900 bags of brown rice were processed and shipped, with prices rising by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan or more. Spot transactions were suspended due to the high production prices. Rebound goods were priced 0.1 yuan higher. Later, 200 tons of Saigon rice for October were shipped inland and 100 tons were shipped to the local market, with prices ranging from 4.6 yuan to 4.65 yuan, about 0.05 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>

<p>The price of sun-dried longan meat from Xiamen has been falling frequently recently. In previous years, the price of Hainan goods was higher than that of Xiamen, but this year, due to limited production, it was difficult to equalize supply and demand, and the price was higher than that of sun-dried meat. Therefore, the sales of Xiamen goods have been gradually increasing, but prices have been difficult to improve. Yesterday, the numbered shops continued to open more than 100 boxes, and the price fell another 3 yuan. The market price may stabilize somewhat at this point.</p>

<p>— Hua Zi</p>
<p>Because he knew my recent living situation was not good, a classmate from several years ago (but who had also been estranged for several years) came to my humble abode one evening, saying he had found a position for me, with decent pay. He then left a letter of introduction, telling me to see a certain Mr. So-and-so the next morning. He said, "I feel you are someone who deserves a better life, and the people in my family all say you are a 'good' person, and they kept urging me to pay attention to you. Now, fortunately, I have succeeded." Although my heart was not exactly leaping for joy, as if I had been unemployed for a long time and suddenly found work, his sincere goodwill could not but move me.</p>
<p>I went to ask and found out it was just about writing articles. And it wasn't some special assignment or long-term engagement, but just writing articles to the extent that every publication has submission guidelines at the back. I wasn't exactly disappointed, because I hadn't had much expectation to begin with. I understood very well that my long-estranged classmate studied engineering, and he had been slightly fooled. But his being slightly fooled wasn't because someone deliberately deceived him. He himself didn't realize he had been fooled; on the contrary, he felt immense joy, feeling that he had done something for an old friend. Life is fleeting, how many times can one experience such joy?</p>
<p>People in the world can generally be divided into two types. One is born to be deceived, and the other is born with a skeptical nature, who, even if not necessarily deceiving others, at least doesn't easily get deceived. The former are the so-called simpletons, overly "honest folks," or at least those with a bit of a simple air; the latter often manifest as free and unrestrained thinkers, skeptics. An extreme example of the former would be Mr. Quixote, and the latter can be found in abundance in late 19th-century Russian novels.</p>
<p>The world's successful people also carry a bit of the simpleton's air. Because the world itself is an adventure, if one is suspicious to the left and right, where is there hope of success? The same goes even more so for love. The former see love as a second life, the latter see it as a game. But those who get the greatest taste of love are, of course, the former. Anatole France's novel "Thaïs," its protagonist Paphnutius, is a strict ascetic, but for a dancer Thaïs, he even abandons his faith; but it is he, not Nicias, who obtains the essence of love and tastes the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>The greatness and happiness of those easily deceived! Only they can taste the true flavor of life, the meaning of love. No wonder someone said, "Those who have passed through the youth and prime of life and reached old age should quietly reflect on the past, and they will only regret that they were never deceived in their love life, and never regret being deceived even once."</p>
<h3 id="e254">Postscript to "A Lohan Born from a Clam Shell" <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Yesterday I finished writing the article "A Lohan Born from a Clam Shell," and today I remembered that the Qing dynasty Yongne Jushi's "Zhi Wen Lu," volume three, has a section called "Buddha Pearl in a Clam."</p>
<p>The story of the "Buddha Pearl in a Clam" goes like this:</p>
<p>In the fifth month of the year Yiwei during the Qianlong reign, there was a severe drought in Jiangnan, and the water in Chaohu Lake in Chaoxian County also dried up, and boats could not move. One night, the moonlight was very good. A fisherman suddenly saw a cool breeze coming from the bow of his boat, the water was only a little over a foot deep, and it seemed like something was breathing there, but he couldn't find it. So he raised the small sail on his boat and went with the wind. By dawn, he had traveled over a hundred li, the wind stopped, and the water was dry again, and the boat couldn't move. He saw a large clam, as big as a wooden basin, very shiny, and he felt strange, so he opened the clam shell and found a Buddha pearl inside, with eyebrows, eyes, and body, nothing missing, and it glowed every night. He took this large clam to a jewelry shop to consign it for sale, and it happened that a tributary envoy from a Western country was there at the time. When he saw it, he was very fond of it and was willing to pay 30,000 taels of silver to buy it. Unexpectedly, the fisherman was greedy and hoped for a higher price, so he delayed for a long time and did not sell it. Later, he went to ask the envoy again, and the envoy said, "If you had wanted to sell it to me before, I would have doubled the price, but now it's not worth a penny." The fisherman was shocked and asked him, "Why were you willing to pay a high price before, but now you say it's not worth a penny?" He said, "Before, the clam pearl was very good and could be cultivated. If you nourished it with medicine, it could still grow bigger. Now the clam is dead, it's just a carved thing for people to admire." The fisherman still carried the clam to the jewelry shop to sell, and only got 500 cash.</p>
<p>This is of course another myth.</p>

<p>— Fu Hongliao</p>
<p>Literature gives young people such a beautiful vision. However, when any young person begins to step into the confines of literature, there is not one who does not feel lost and at a loss. That is to say, when a young person steps from beautiful fantasy into practice, they are hindered in their minds by questions of literary schools, paths, which famous works should be read to benefit their initial learning, or the relationship between the selection of books and the times. Or, they even go to the bookstore and, facing the dazzling array of books, do not know which one to buy. All of this is a common worry for young people who love literature and are learning it, and this worry has been inherited from the May Fourth Movement until now.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this phenomenon? Of course, we cannot blame a young person for not having the talent to choose. What we should blame is our own literary world, and those writers who are recognized or consider themselves to have a considerable history and responsibility in the literary world! The inheritance that young people should get in the literary system (this is not the same as the inheritance mentioned in the "Literary Monthly") is indeed too meager, or even non-existent. If young people want to read a relatively systematic literary history or a book on literary theory, they will find several different facts and theories in the books (this fact can often be seen in the questions and answers of young people in this newspaper's reading column). If they want to read some world masterpieces, they will also find many translation sentences that they cannot understand in the books. What they see in some publications is only the struggle of opinions and disguised criticism. They want to obtain some experience from famous writers on the cultivation of learning literature, as well as sincere instructions on literature, or notes of writers' research on literature (such as Notebook), which is as elusive as fantasy. These reasons are all elements that damage the vitality of the entire literary world, and will also affect the question of "why there are no great works produced in the literary world." Old writers have forgotten the hardships of their own success, and have completely forgotten about young people. The new forces in the literary world are not seen to be produced, and the old writers are inevitably constrained by age, resulting in the entire literary world becoming anemic, and so-called other miscellaneous diseases, such as "literary revival," are also rising at the same time. The future is indeed unimaginable!</p>
<p>From this phenomenon, we find that "the literary world needs young people, and young people need guidance!" This is not only true for young people who love literature, but also for young people in universities!</p>
<p>In the first issue of the third volume of the "Literary Monthly," there is an article "University Literature," which is a communication from a university's literature department. There is a very realistic description, saying that literary people in a literature department hardly know literature. The reason is that it is too indifferent and irrelevant to the Chinese literary world. Although they also read many world literature books, they themselves cannot say what they are doing and some of the true meanings of literature. Although they know that the literature department is engaged in literary work, in fact, it is difficult for such talents to come from the literature department. It can be seen how lost young people are in literature, and at the same time how much they need beneficial guidance!</p>
<p>At present, in order to remedy this deficiency, I think we should imitate the kind of organized and systematic "circulating libraries" established in Japan.</p>
<p>"Circulating libraries" are bookstores in Japan that specialize in renting literary books and magazines. For a monthly fee of three yuan, they subscribe to a "circulating" book, and they will send a book every three days. No matter what great work it is, the title is chosen by oneself, and ten books can be read every month.</p>
<p>This method is indeed very beneficial to young people. On the one hand, it can save young people from the heavy burden of book fees, and at the same time, it can urge and increase young people's desire to read. It is indeed worth imitating.</p>
<p>There have been "circulating libraries"-style bookstores in China, but what they rent to young people are some knight-errant and Zhang Henshui-style novels. There is simply not a single new literary book. Therefore, at present, we feel that new literary rental bookstores in the "circulating libraries" style are very necessary. Our method is to be run by many people who have made contributions and have cultivation in literature, and to choose truly valuable literary books in the world. A form should be issued to those who rent books, so that they can fill it out. For young people who are just entering the garden of literature, we can choose a systematic book on literary research for them. Send it to them to read, so that they will not feel so confused about literature. Moreover, in this current society of economic depression, it is even more necessary to reduce the burden of books!</p>
<p>Of course, we do not advocate that young people study literature rigidly, but this method will at least be very beneficial to "beginners"!</p>
<h3 id="e256">Translation is Popular Again This Year <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Translated works were once regarded as "matchmakers" and have been looked down upon ever since. You can tell by how few Chinese translations there are. As for magazines that are entirely composed of translated works, it goes without saying that they cannot be seen.</p>
<p>But this year, the situation has changed a bit.</p>
<p>First, "Literature" came up with a special translation issue. "Planned translation is necessary; at the same time, it is also necessary to break the air of contempt for translation." From these words, we express deep sympathy for the painstaking efforts of publishing a special translation issue. However, is it enough to just have one magazine publish a special issue?</p>
<p>Then, after half a year, "Translation" appeared.</p>
<p>Regarding "Translation," some people have already talked about it, so I will skip it here.</p>
<p>Following "Translation," "World Literature" appeared.</p>
<p>This is another publication that focuses on translation, with the purpose of "introducing the literature of various countries, estimating its value for world literature, that is, new literature; publishing works whose content or form can be used as a resource; taking an absolutely objective attitude to explore the path of Chinese literature to world literature" (see the inaugural speech).</p>
<p>Leaving aside its verbose inaugural speech; just looking at the content of its inaugural issue, I think this is a publication worth introducing.</p>
<p>I admire writers who can write excellent works; I sometimes even admire those who can translate great foreign masterpieces very well. This kind of hard work is sometimes more difficult than creation, and even requires a kind of low-energy brute force. You cannot say that a masterpiece by Shakespeare is ultimately not a Chinese work and therefore ignore it; on the contrary, introducing the works of Tolstoy, Gorky, and Zola to China clearly has its significance.</p>
<p>Especially for those of us who are engaged in writing, it is good to be able to find something to learn from in their works.</p>
<p>However, the facts show us that Chinese translations are often not welcomed, because some of them are really incomprehensible. Once such unfaithful translations become numerous in the market, they make people get a headache as soon as they hear the word translation. "Throwing away food because one choked on it" is not good. There are some people who can translate good things, but the general public does not have the patience to choose, and so translation has suffered a bit of misfortune.</p>
<p>At the time of the inaugural issue of "Translation" and "World Literature," I hope that they will strive to make it perfect in terms of content; what to translate and how to translate must be carefully considered. If it can change the current attitude of the public, then the so-called "magazine year" will have made some contribution after all.</p>
<p>Also, "Modern" has also published a special issue on American literature, making the voice of translation even louder. May more foreign masterpieces be introduced to China from now on, I am afraid that the progress of creation also depends on this to some extent.</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>The people in the village heard about Dong Quezi. They all hid. Shanfu smoked a good amount of opium at Aji's house and walked from the head of the village. He walked along, singing Meng Jiangnu. He didn't know what had happened in the village. Why was he being attacked? He didn't see anyone returning from working in the mountains or fields. He sang and sang until he reached Cuiluting Pavilion. Suddenly, more than a dozen hands stretched out from the pavilion, grabbing his chest, grabbing his hands, and pulling his legs. Shanfu was immediately tied up by those yellow uniforms.</p>
<p>"What, what? Are you robbing in broad daylight?" Shanfu was startled, and then he understood what was going on. But he still shouted in a pompous manner.</p>
<p>"Robbing? Calling you to training." The squad leader stood up from the wooden beam in the pavilion. "Okay, now we have you to make up the numbers. We don't need the village chief to ask for people anymore."</p>
<p>"Haha!" Shanfu laughed. "Are you drafting soldiers? Why didn't you tell me earlier? I have nothing to do. I'm very willing to learn how to drill." He said, loosening his right hand, took out a cigarette, and sent it to the squad leader's mouth, "What's your honorable surname?"</p>
<p>"My surname is Hong." The squad leader responded weakly.</p>
<p>"Your full name." Shanfu was full of flattery.</p>
<p>"My given name is Le." The squad leader couldn't help but soften his tone.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Filial Piety Paper <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The words "filial son" originally have several interpretations: (1) A filial son is when parents show filial piety to their son, not when the son shows filial piety to his parents, this is called a filial son, (2) A filial son is only filial in words, so it is called a "filial mouth." Truly, these words are already "old sayings," so let's not talk about them, but it's always "filial son."</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to see a thick obituary on a friend's desk. I opened it and looked at it. From important figures in the national government (except for Sun Yat-sen, who did not write an inscription) to famous figures in Shanghai, there were many praises that they uttered to the extreme! It was really amazing. I repeatedly praised, filial son! Filial son!</p>
<p>Later, I looked for his career in the biography, but I couldn't find any of his great achievements. It just said that he had done his best in public welfare undertakings and had made no small contribution to the revolution, etc., empty words. Ah! It was even more amazing. Such a character was actually praised by everyone. It was really amazing.</p>
<p>Later, I pondered the reason, and it turned out that the father became noble because of the son. It was also a way to show off relatives and make a name for oneself. But, but... if the son is not raised well, where would there be such achievements to honor the ancestors? Therefore, the father becomes noble because of the son, and the son also becomes noble because of the father. A non-filial son cannot achieve this.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suspected that the two previous interpretations of the words "filial son" might still have errors. Now everyone doesn't talk about filial piety, and everyone has a headache when they talk about filial sons. Therefore, looking at the facts, we only see "filial piety paper" and don't see filial sons. Therefore, rather than saying that he is a filial son, it is more accurate to say that he is a "filial piety paper."</p>
<h3 id="e259">Osmanthus Blossoms <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Shucheng</p>
<p>The maple leaves, as if having drunk too much wine, are drunk with flushed faces, and the thin yellow willow leaves are driven down from the increasingly weakened mother branches, piece by piece, by the merciless west wind, lying horizontally on the sidewalk where passersby tread on them, sighing with their heads lowered!</p>
<p>The sky appears strangely solemn. The evening wind is blowing rustlingly, carrying the sound of galloping horses and men! I walk alone in the autumn wilderness, every cell in my body is contracting; at this moment, I am really a little frightened!</p>
<p>The osmanthus flowers have been blown open by the west wind, emitting a rich fragrance! It is planted in a corner of the southeast side of the backyard; next to it are several withered willows. In the hazy twilight, there are two or three children searching for the "chirping, chirping" little bugs among the tiles and wall crevices.</p>
<p>My mother, holding my clever third sister's hand, walks out from the back door, her face full of smiles, showing extreme kindness; pointing to the osmanthus tree in full bloom, she says to me, "This was planted by your grandfather!"</p>
<p>"It was the year after this house was built." She added a footnote, pointing to her own house.</p>
<p>I have never seen my grandfather: the words "hand-planted" were a bit incomprehensible to my weak brain at that time. However, my fondness for osmanthus flowers developed from picking their petals, drying them in the sun, storing them in bottles, pickling them with salt, and then using them to make tea, which I found fragrant and delicious! So, when it came to the time of the winter solstice or the New Year, the neighbors all liked to come to my house to drink "osmanthus tea."</p>
<p>This was five years ago, and I haven't forgotten it at all; now, when I think back to it, it seems like it was just yesterday! But time is a bit like a thief, imperceptibly slipping past our heads, bodies, and fingers. Now, I have put on the crown of "adulthood," causing me to drift everywhere, suffering the cold eyes of people, and tasting enough of the sourness and bitterness of the world! Ah, my wandering wanderer! My mind is like duckweed; unable to find support, unable to find comfort!</p>
<p>The red maple leaves and the thin yellow willow leaves are falling down with the west wind in rhythm again, the osmanthus flowers in the campus are emitting a rich fragrance, but; what about my home, which is five hundred miles away?</p>
<h3 id="e260">People Who Fly Over Walls <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Zi</p>
<p>This year is a year of revival of the old ways. Not only are men and women not allowed to touch hands, but the other reflections of this are also bizarre and abound. For example, a few years ago, there was a public search for people who could fly over walls, but the result was disappointing. Not only were there no people who could fly over walls, but there weren't even any applicants. This made that talent-seeking adult very unhappy, and he sighed that the national martial arts had been lost.</p>
<p>According to the precedents of "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," "The Cases of Judge Shi," "The Cases of Judge Peng," and other martial arts novels, those heroes who flew over walls were mostly on the side of the "Qing Tian" (upright judge) and helped to eliminate harm for the people. To put it more openly, they were the "semi-immortals" who had seen through the world and did not seek fame or profit. They could ride the clouds and mist, and they had flying swords and other magical treasures. They often did not hesitate to start killing in order to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Could it really be that the national martial arts had been lost? Logically, isn't it the time for those heroes who have no use for their martial arts to devote themselves to serving the country and honoring their ancestors? But the result was disappointment. Not even one applicant appeared. This is probably not because the heroes of today are more noble than the heroes in the novels and do not seek prominence, but because of the "loss of national martial arts."</p>
<p>This year is different. What could not be found a few years ago has now appeared automatically. Not only can they fly over walls, but they can also make themselves invulnerable to swords and spears. Even if a pistol is used, the bullets cannot penetrate their bodies. And according to what he told the interviewer, he not only knows these two things, but he also knows flying swords and acupressure.</p>
<p>According to a friend who had visited him, the hero is indeed a very handsome young man. He wears a suit, a silk shirt, and coffee-colored dancing shoes. His hair is combed neatly, and he probably has a layer of snow cream on his face. He keeps smoking cigarettes. If he didn't tell you, no one would think that such a dandy type of person is an invulnerable hero.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is really because the times have progressed that such a decoration is completely different from the impression that martial arts novels give me, but when I think that novels (especially martial arts novels) are mostly castles in the air built by writers, I feel relieved. Therefore, it is too superficial to say that a hero's decoration should not be so beautiful. Moreover, the Peking opera based on old novels is not like this. For example, once I watched "Tian Ba Baisan," the hero who played Huang Tianba changed his clothes three times, and all three sets of clothes were so new and beautiful, and he also wore a sparkling diamond ring on his hand. Can it be said that such a extraordinary hero should not be dressed so beautifully?</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion that being dressed beautifully means not being a hero is too ridiculous, but the fact that Chinese martial arts have not been lost is what makes many people rejoice.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Contradictions <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>"Are humans destined to live in contradictions forever?"</p>
<p>Whenever the night is hazy outside the window and the city's pulse temporarily stops beating, when I am lonely, keeping company with the burnt-out white candle, gazing at the flickering candlelight on the white wall, this question is like a regular customer, visiting me again.</p>
<p>As usual, I furrow my brow, grab my disheveled hair, and freeze. Naturally, I believe that contradictions can make the path of life more accurate and faster. But sometimes - and often - they will inevitably hinder life, making it take detours, or even go backwards.</p>
<p>Right now, the contradictions in life are making me too painful.</p>
<p>When it's lively, I often feel noisy and disgusted, but when it's calm, I often feel lonely.</p>
<p>When I lived in my hometown, it was really boring and monotonous, like a dormant worm, eagerly hoping to go to the city to be active; but when I got to the city, the disturbance and chaos</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The appearance made me uneasy, and I often missed the beautiful hometown.</p>
<p>Like ordinary people, in the hot summer, when the sun is scorching above my head and sweat is flying, I really hate it and think it's better to be in winter. But when winter really comes, the north wind howls, the snow flies, and it's so cold that my nose almost falls off, I get the idea that it would be better to be a little hotter in the summer.</p>
<p>The most painful thing is not the things mentioned above; but the contradiction between emotion and reason is what makes it most impossible for me to resolve.</p>
<p>Often, because of the pressure of life, I want to recklessly do something despicable in order to seek material enjoyment and a high position. When I think about it again, reason immediately puts on a solemn face and scolds me unceremoniously. He teaches me that I should have a strict life, walk on a straight path, and seek light through constant effort.</p>
<p>Most of my time can be said to have slipped by in the contradictions of ideals and the contradictions of behavior, as well as the contradictions of ideals and behavior. However, to this day I still cannot definitively answer this question:</p>
<p>"Are humans destined to live in contradictions forever?"</p>

<h3 id="e263">Friendship <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Dongdong</p>
<p>I didn't close my eyes all night, perhaps due to excessive excitement. Truly, friend! After your mother told me about you, I was so happy I didn't know how to express it. For your mother, of course, it was like regaining a beloved treasure; however, she couldn't help but shed a few tears. The sudden joy stirred up her past sorrows, and she worries that your strong personality will be unwilling to accept her earnest advice and return home. I comforted her for a while and, at her request, promised to come here and find you today.</p>
<p>On the way home, your shadow never left my mind. Indeed, your departure that time was a bit too hard-hearted. We are old friends of many years. I sympathize with your character, your hidden sadness; I feel that your character is not something that ordinary, vulgar people can understand, but I truly don't understand why you treat me the same as everyone else. In any case, you should consider this a fault and reproach yourself for it. Moreover, you abandoned your white-haired mother and young siblings.</p>
<p>When the clock struck six, I rubbed my tired eyes, propped up my weary limbs, washed my face with cold water, braced myself, and rushed to catch the early boat to Village C.</p>
<p>Arriving at Village C, I quickly grabbed a sturdy man and inquired about the route here. He stretched out his fingertip and pointed for a long time. I just responded with "uh-huh, uh-huh" to his voice, but I was actually very confused. The number of right and left turns left me not knowing which road to take first. The burly man probably realized I couldn't remember all the turns at once, so he finally told me to go straight ahead on the left side, and then ask passersby at the intersection. I followed his directions, walked for a full hour, asked several people, and finally arrived at your quaint residence.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, you had just gone out. I asked your neighbor, and she said you rarely go out. You usually just sit at home all day. She didn't know what made you go out today, causing you to temporarily abandon this old house.</p>
<p>I have been waiting here for almost three hours. I can't wait any longer. I have to go back. If I'm late, I'm afraid I'll miss the boat and make my family worry. Now, I have written so many words to you. It is my sincere hope that you will come home!</p>
<h3 id="e264">Gambling and Entertainment <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>Since human society evolved to the point where people are dissatisfied with material enjoyment, human desires have grown, and their gambling spirit has become stronger. Therefore, they want to get rich effortlessly in the shortest possible time from their impoverished circumstances. As a result, gambling for profit has become a traditional concept. Especially in this present society where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the trend of gambling is at its peak.</p>
<p>Although gambling was not completely absent in ancient times, judging from the historical fact that Confucius, the sage, considered gambling as extracurricular activity to be encouraged among his students during the Warring States and Spring and Autumn periods, it is clear that the ancients did not intend to get rich from it. (The Analects records: "The Master said, 'Is it not better to play chess than to do nothing all day long?'" Confucius believed that gambling all day was better than being idle all day. However, nowadays, even playing chess is used to make a small fortune, truly the morals of the world are deteriorating, it is unbearable to look back!)</p>
<p>What is most puzzling is that for all entertainment activities, if there is no money involved in winning or losing, people think it's boring and uninteresting. Isn't this strange? Four old women play mahjong! They naturally think they are having fun, but if someone declares that this is just for fun, then they are unwilling to sit together. Does this mean that entertainment and gambling cannot be separated? The more you think about it, the more inexplicable it becomes.</p>
<p>Foreigners' horse racing, dog racing, and jai alai games, on the surface, are clearly games for the entertainment of the audience; but they are for gambling. One side sets up these games to collect commission as a business, and the other side buys tickets and gambles in the hope of making a small fortune. Foreigners understand the weaknesses of human nature in society. They commercialize entertainment activities and use them to do business, which is something that our ancient Chinese sages could not even imagine.</p>
<p>However, the reason why there are people who set up gambling for profit and people who gamble in the hope of getting rich is because the social system makes people dissatisfied with material enjoyment. If there is no gambling in society one day, it must be when a social system that allows people to be satisfied with material enjoyment arrives.</p>

<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>In the morning, a round sun had already hung in the sky, and birds chirped sharply, seeming to be immersed in mutual joy. All around was quiet.</p>
<p>People were all in sweet slumber. In order to fight for life, I had to abandon my comfortable sleep.</p>
