<p>— 恒</p>
<p>第二次大戰之爆發。於日本强佔我東四省時。言者甚多。且信其必在東方。及至最近一年以來。因國際間新問題之　生各國注意力方向轉移遂使前此極度緊張之遠東問題。爲之無形弛緩。而二次大戰之呼聲。亦日見銷沈。談國際政治者。亦多疑二次大戰勢將先發於歐洲。實則我之東北問題一日不解决。則遠東之火藥庫。亦必一日不消滅。一年來各國之所以對東方沈默者尙在實力未足以應付日本耳。試觀遠東利益最著各國之亟亟備戰從可知其對日態度。實未放鬆如英國二年來竭力擴大海軍預算趕速完成新加坡軍港。意義所在。不問可知。至於美國。雖已許諾菲島獨立然其國會所通過之一○二艘海軍案。實爲華府會議以來僅有之壯舉。謂其用意在於自保。不欲過問日本在遠東之行動。孰能信之。他如在遠東擁有安南殖民地之法國。其海軍預算之增加。亦堪驚人。按法之海軍預算。一九三三丨三四年僅爲二·七一七·○○○·○○○佛郎。本年三月六日國會通過預算。則增至九。○一三·○○○·○○○佛郎。可見其意。亦非不欲置喙遠東問題也。至於蘇俄對日備戰。屢見報章。尤爲顯然。綜上所述。可知往日各國之沈默乃在埋頭，預備實力。以作第二次大戰之凖備。近自日本外務省務省發表對華聲明後所生之反響似各國之意嚮。並未較淡於九一八與一二八之時也。</p>
<p>故第二次世界大戰之爆發。實爲時間問題。而其爆發之導綫。恐仍將以遠東問題爲核心。蓋日本一日佔有東北。則英美法俄在遠東之勢力必致一日不能均衡各國在華之經濟利益。不獨有受日本壟斷之虞。卽英美法俄在太平洋印度洋之領土。亦有依次受其侵蝕之患。故其欲圖限止日本勢力之過度擴張。亦爲事理所必至。觀於英國今日之主張擁護九國公約與各國輿論之一致枰擊日本。尤爲昭著。特歐。美各國與日本之戰爭。何時爆發尙。尙難預言耳。以大勢推之。設第二太平洋會議時。有關遠東之均勢問題。與英美日三國海軍比例問題。不能解决。則皆能使遠東之戰禍。加速爆發者也。</p>
<p>我國於此局勢之下。果將採若何之政策乎。此値得吾人深切注意者也。若此一大戰發生於太平洋。我如置身局外。坐觀成敗。則不論何方勝利。中國皆有受人宰割之虞。蓋日本而勝。則我將受日本之獨力支配。日本而敗。則我亦將坐待列强之瓜分。故大戰一旦爆發。其勢不容我國保持中立。不容我國不參預戰爭。吾國所能選擇者。僅爲果將站在列强方面。抑將站在日方面之一點。就近數十年之歷史以觀。中國之所以能至今不亡者。賴有列强之均勢耳。均勢存。中國尙能自存。均勢破。則中國卽不堪設想矣。唯其如是。中國之應付政策。不利於一國之獨强。而利於列强之均勢。今各國之所以不直日本。而羣起作實力之凖備者。卽欲保持其在遠東之均勢。均勢一破。列强各國勢必各自爲謀。各自競圖其在遠東之勢力。而我益危。明乎此點。則在此世界大戰未爆發之前。我國不能不有所考慮。有所凖備矣。</p>
<p>總之立國於世界之上。所以能獨立生存者。無一不恃多聯與國况中國當此危難之際。國際能與吾以同情者。者尤當保持之。各國外交政策當然不肯輕易表示。外交當局一時之喜怒。亦不能窺測其眞意之所在。故當國者亦不能據一時之情勢而定我方針。惟多聯與國。乃外交上一定不易的有利主義。吾之此言。非欲依賴國際之援助也。依賴他人而自己漫無布置。職爲誤國之道。必也一方利用國際間之情勢。運用敏捷这外交手腕。以善謀應付。一則本自己一貫之外交政策。努力凖備實力。將來時機一到。庶不致束手無策耳。</p>

<p>廢買辦改管事查輪船上業務管理、各國均無用買辦包繳制者、唯我國有此畸形制度、蓋當初外輪行駛我國内地、不諳營業、故有雇用華人、以充買辦、浸淫至今、本國商輪、亦設買辦一職、而將客脚行包繳制、因之積弊叢生、買辦但求增多收入時、有乘客溢額釀生危險、上年招商局曾施行廢除買辦制、結果祗普安新銘等二三船、餘仍打不破此積習、今交部議定將各輪買辦、一律廢除、關於業務部分之職務、由輪公司改聘熟諳航務之管事長充任、以打破包繳制度、</p>

<p>中央社云、昨據國際貿易局指導處主任李澤晋談、吾國砲竹焰火、製造精良、出口頻繁、輸往南洋者尤夥、近年荷印亦設</p>
<p>廠自製、計三十一家、但出品幼稚、數量有限、平均每年約値一百三十五萬盾、而荷印之砲竹焰火消費、平均年需六百萬盾左右、其中百分之九十一爲發響之砲竹、尤以鞭砲爲最多、此項砲竹、十九輸自我國者、</p>
<h3 id="c134">釐訂條例動機 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>當地所設之製造廠、亦有相當成績、故該項條例之成立、實爲維護當地炮竹焰火工廠之發展、蓋歷來輸入之炮竹焰火、從未發生任何危險、祇有當地工廠、因配合綠酸鹽　ｈｌｏｒａｔｅ混合原料不愼、曾經爆發數次、查製造有聲炮竹、先前均用硝石混合原料、惟因用該項原料、如非配合十分凖確、與封裹緊固、燃放發聲、每不響亮、故以後皆改用鈣Ｃａｌｃｉｕｍ綠酸鹽Ｃｈｌｏｒａｔｅ配合、取其發聲較高、製造時亦比較容易、但配合時往往有爆發之危險、該地政府、因於一九二九年三月一日出令禁止、當地廠家、旣不能用鈣Ｃａｌｃｉｕｍ綠酸鹽Ｃｈｌｏｒａｔｅ製造、其出品之發聲高度、更不能與入口貨競爭、故條例中併入口炮竹焰火之含有鈣綠酸鹽者、亦均禁止輸入、條例中之准許入口者、皆屬於當地廠家已能製造而有成效者、所以使當地之出品與入口貨、不致相差太鉅也、</p>

<p>對於華歐籍居民、除購買乎續、依律繳費之外、並無多大關係、政府特别注意之處、當在土人、土人居處尙多茅屋、隨意燃放炮竹焰火、不無危險、加之大多數土人、對於經濟向無預算、亦毫不知節制、每逢年節婚事、或舉行割禮、亦以大事燃放焰火炮竹爲榮耀、往往因消費太大、無力完納國稅、燃放炮竹焰火、須請准後、政府卽易以監視其經濟能力、而加以限制矣、</p>

<p>昨日將國際新聞的本質及鑑别國</p>
<p>際新聞應具的知識槪略的述過了。今日進而槪述中國報紙上的國際新聞的讀法。編者</p>
<p>中國報紙對於國際新聞向來是不大注意的。以前只有沿海沿江的幾個大都市裏、日報上纔裝飾一排或二排左右地位的國際新聞。至於，有系統論述國際時事的雜誌，以前更是少有。現在可有些兩樣了。因爲中國受到國際情勢的影響太大、要求國際知識的人也越多，報紙雜誌也就漸漸注意這方面來了。在日報方面，上海的申報，新聞報，時事新報，都有相當地位登載國際新聞，其他如中華日報，民報，時報，晨報，大美，大晚兩晚報亦都不忽略國際新聞的登載，材料亦比較豐富，外埠如南京中央日報（官辦的）中國日報，新京日報，也都載重要的國際電訊，北平的京報，晨報，天津的大公報，益世報，廣東香港漢口各大日報均有國際新聞一欄。這些報紙中的國際新聞雖然大部分均先見於上海各報，但其中亦有先見於北平天津或廣州方面者，這因爲北平現在仍是華北政治的中心，天津又爲華北國際貿易的樞紐，廣州是西南政治中心，他們受到國際方面的刺激有時是直接的，關於最近我們還應加以注意的，是南昌九江方面的日報，雖然他們是内地報的性質，國際新聞篇幅甚少，但因南昌事實上成了今日中國政治的總樞紐，一切重要會議，重要國策大多决定於比。在這裏的日報中，有時也可以得一些國際與中國的消息的片斷。</p>
<p>讀中國報紙中的新聞比讀外國報紙中的國際新聞要不同得多。大槪在外國，全國報紙所刋載的國際新聞大大體上總是一致的，而我國就完全兩樣。這是因爲别人的新聞事業有了統制，報紙規模大，銷路寛，經濟力雄厚，交通工具完備，人才衆多，可以在世界各重要政治經濟中心特派記者。中國報紙完全不能如此。中國新聞不獨自己不能統治，反之，幾乎外國通訊社統治了中國新聞事業，至少在國際新聞部分是如此。中國報紙上的國際新聞是從何處採訪的呢？是仰賴外國通訊社。在中國供給新聞的外國通訊社，最有名的有英國的路透社，法國的哈瓦斯社，德國海洋社，美國的合衆社，日本的新聞聯合社與電報通訊社，蘇聯的塔斯社等。他們因爲各具有不同的政治經濟背景，藉着政治經濟的威力直接侵入中國新聞事業來；自然，他們發出的稿子，只是替自己國家政策辯護，彼此有矛盾的。這一點。是中國報紙上國際新聞的特色，對於偶然披閱國際新聞的人，見了同一國際事件許多矛盾的記載，弄得不知信誰的好，不免有點費解。但是在有了讀報經騐的人，對於了解國際事件的眞僞上倒反特别覺得便利。</p>
<p>自然，在閱讀國際新聞時，先檢查這一新聞的來源，明瞭其政治的立塲與背影是必要的。首先，注意發這稿的通訊社。關於以上幾家通訊社的立塲用不着我們再一一詳說，他們中除塔斯社另有其背景外，其他都可說是帝國主義的侵略勢力，不同的是各自利害不同·而又互相傾軋罷了。</p>
<p>次之，我們應明瞭中國報紙編輯國際新聞的習慣。因爲中國報紙對於國際新聞的登載，</p>
<p>向例是取所謂［客觀主義］的。就是對於一個國際事件，許多不同的報告，在一處登出。同時用小標題，聲明［Ｘ方意見］，［Ｘ國態度一］或</p>
<p>［Ｘ通訊社所傳如此］等字樣。到底眞像如何，讓讀者自己去比較。但這每每使人厭煩，因爲同一消息分作各方面記述，總不免有些重覆，粗心的人，自然隨便讀一部分就擱置了。然蒐集國際問題的專家和精心的讀者，却不應怕麻煩，一定不能採取了某（方）的意見就滿足了。這是最最値得注意的一點。這也是最有價値的材料。</p>
<p>第三，檢查一件國際新聞，不要因爲它是虚造的謠言，就棄之不取了，你儘可不相信它，你却應一視同仁把它作一伴材料看。因爲卽令是一件謠言，它本身也是有新聞價値的。甲國對乙國爲什麽要虚構這種謠言？謠言的作用是什麽？一個研究國際新聞的人，（如果抱的是科學者的態度）他就要窮追造這謠言的根源。如日本時常傳出蘇聯在遠東有增兵等等，無非藉以掩飾自己確已增兵我三省的鐵證。諸如此類，不勝枚舉。（未完）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>然而無論什麽困難的問題，終是有辦法可以解决的。當那司機或是他的助手，那火夫或是他的助手，以及那些司閘夫，－他們一共是六個－需要進食或睡覺的時候，他們都可以回到那掛在煤水車後面的半節車廂裏去。在吃的時候，雖然站着或俯着是很吃力的，可是他們蹲的方法都是很熟練，儘可以蹲着吃飯或喝茶。我們往往看見中國的工役，在平時也是很歡喜蹲踞着的。</p>
<p>那末睡覺又怎麽樣呢？</p>
<p>無論什麽人總不能站着睡覺啊！就是他們這些習慣於蹲着的工役，也不能蹲着睡啊！只要車子輕輕一動，他就要倒下來了。但是不要忙，還有一個很聰明的法子咧！這個法子也是宮中人所常用的。譬如我，照例也是絶對不許當着太后坐下去的，除非伊給我特許賞賜我坐，我才可以坐；卽使在伊睡覺的當兒，輪到我服侍，我也不能私自在什麽椅子或凳子上坐下。但是我可以坐在地板上，或躺在地板上。－祗苦少一個舒適的枕頭而已－因爲我坐在地上，或是躺在地上的時候，我的身體比較伊老人家躺在床上的身體終是低，所以便不算違法了。</p>
<p>這些車上的工役，便完全仿效了我們的辦法。</p>
<p>他們雖不能坐，也不能蹲着睡覺，可是他們儘可以躺在地板上啊！這樣，他們終比太后低了。太后在自己的車廂裏，不是坐在伊的寳座上，便是躺在床上。床當然總比地板高多了！（二○）</p>

<p>— 熊丸</p>
<p>浴着暖暖的春陽，很輕適地踏上這座白川橋。微風沿河岸横向橋上吹過，帶來不少的菜子花香。橋下的河水緩緩地流着，反映日光，燦爛奪目。橋上不時有一輛汽車輕快地馳過；幾輛人力車懶懶地拖過；幾個人兒微笑地踱過。他們都很自然的。馳過，拖過，踱過。然而我，神經過敏了罷？總覺得這景象有點異樣：這微風帶來的不是菜子花香，倒彷彿有點腥氣。流着的河水，多少帶有些紅色，像血一般。這座漆黑了的白川橋，獰猙了它的面目，就彷彿是前年屠燒上海的白川大將的面容。我憤恨了，却恐懼了，慌慌地跑下橋來，奔回吳淞。從黃浦江裏迎面駛來一條大輪，施杆上一面紅團團的旗子飄揚着。我，沒有什麽！</p>

<p>— 蛋</p>
<p>早些年第一次到上海，便看見水菓攤上擺有所謂［暹羅蜜橘］，各大公司的水菓部也有。</p>
<p>這種橘子（其實是柑）在南方更多，却沒有標明國籍，但一到上海便變爲暹羅的了。它從什麽時候起入了暹羅籍，或眞是暹羅來的，而暹羅那樣的氣候會不會產生這種橘子？這些問題連大菓攤的老板們也很含糊。祇因一向呌［暹羅蜜橘］，便呌［暹羅蜜橘］。</p>
<p>其實這種［暹羅蜜橘］並不是暹羅來的，它是眞正國貨，像胡蝶是國貨明星樣，並無假冒等情。</p>
<p>暹羅出口除了米是大宗，柚子與杧果也佔了相當地位？柚子因爲兩廣福建都有，所以在中國的銷路沒有杧果那麽好。在中國市塲的杧果，上海這方面幾乎全給暹羅佔了去，吕宋的［象牙杧］雖也很有名，但不大見。暹羅當然也有橘子，係一種熱帶的橘子，色靑黃，皮薄味酸，實不高明。</p>
<p>現在在上海水菓攤出售的所謂［暹羅蜜橘］，本是潮州的［椒柑］。［編者按伯鴻君來函，云名漿柑，產於潮陽。）道地國貨，大家却硬把它當做外國種，并且引起有心人惟經先生的注意，隱隱呌人抵制。眞是未出國門，便成異類，橘而有知，此恨綿綿。</p>

<p>第二十八回　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書</p>
<p>舊歷新年，有兩件事情，給人一種最大的印象。其一是晚上的爆竹聲，其二便是人家張貼的春聯。在晚上爆竹無聲，引起了甘積之許多感慨。到了第二日上午，偶然送一個客到大門口來，見海甸街上人家門首，紅紙招展，都貼有春聯，而且家家大門緊閉。再加上兩三個穿新衣服的小孩子，由面前經過，這便令人感到今天的氣象，究竟舉平常不同。過了一會，甘厚之照舊上衙門去了，甘太太請了幾位街坊來打牌，只把積之一個人丢在書房裏。他心想，今天究竟是個節期，這樣在家裏坐着，未免無聊。街上那些春聯，也是民間文學之一，何妨親自去調查一下。將來作一篇小品投到報館裏去，也可以弄他幾個稿費。他有了這個心事，就把昨天立誓不出門的那個心願給忘了。穿上了大衣，帶着鉛筆和日記本子，就向街上走來。看了有二三十家，都是些陳舊的套子，不過却矛盾的有趣。有一家羊肉店門口，却是［太平歲月，積善人家。一］一棺材店門口，又是［座上客常滿，樽中酒不空。］還有一家接生姥姥，門口竟貼着［一人有慶，五世其倡］的小對聯。這個倡字不知是故意如此寫的，或是寫錯了，然而上聯的一人有慶，在接生姥姥口裏，就萬不宜出此。試想他要和多少人接生，結果只是一人有慶，這不太慘了嗎？（三七一）</p>

<p>— 無聊客</p>
<p>前人對於硯的研究，眞可謂無微不至，如硯的使用，新墨不宜重磨；開水不宜偶用；則有所謂用硯法。如硯的洗滌，重漬擦磨用浮炭；平常洗滌用蓮殼皂莢；則有所謂滌硯法。硯更宜用何材。内襯宜用何物；則有所謂藏硯法。冬天用硯，如何防損壞，如何使不冰凍；則有所謂暖硯法。修補破損，如何利用石末，如何鍜鍊臘；則有所謂補硯法。凡此種種，確亦有些藝術的意味，但實在太瑣細了，故皆略而不論。惟於文化藝術上最有關係的一點，就是在辨别作品眞贋，此則不可不詳細研究的。至於如何研究辨别眞贋，日人有一種方法，可以介紹諸位。</p>
<p>日人說；中國古硯上詩銘題跋的雕刻，眞僞很難判别，吾人欲研究中國古硯，祇有從古來之書畫金石文字上用功。好在中國近來，已公開研究書畫，可以熟看書畫之眞蹟，以參證硯的眞僞，如高鳳翰以左手刻銘，則須留心其流傳之字跡，是否有同樣之體魄與姿勢。黃莘田刻銘，眞有一種閩派的特徵，能多看黃與閩派人的作品，始能識其優劣。金冬心的書畫法，係一種變體，變體反易假冒，須先知其學力之深厚，與其用筆的來源，乃始能漸辨其眞僞。又如高鳳翰紀曉嵐等作品有拓本者，則從其拓本而細細研究之。有一種工書而不能篆刻之名人，則以所書僱著名鐵筆家代爲篆刻，此際欲辨别其是否保持原態甚難，乾隆所藏之遠奇峯硯（米芾遺硯），係親筆所題，而由著名鐵筆家篆刻，能保持其原有氣勢，是以可貴。總之研究眞僞，必須廣羅篆隸碑帖一切金石文字，及書畫眞蹟，日日勤看，參照比較，不厭不倦，自然左右逢源，見識日進。</p>
<p>茲有必須聲明者；余介紹此種方法，非眞勸人用此方法去研究古硯也，惟以爲無論研究何種文藝，何種科學，必須從此笨辦法苦功夫着手。日人惟能用此笨辦法苦功夫！故其國家乃有如此進步，中國多一見即知一講卽曉的聰明人，而不肯埋頭學笨辦法，用苦功夫，故終於一事無成。倘再自恃其聰明，而不肯從笨辦法苦功夫做起，非特新的文化，新的科學，終於落人之後，永無發展的一日，卽舊的僅存的一些固有的殘缺不全的學藝，亦將放棄以盡，將來要知道一些古代學藝，亦將從日人手中討生活了，這是何等痛心的事！無聊說硯，原是消遺的，滑稽的，於文藝本無多大關係，諸君看也罷，不看也罷；研究罷，不研究也罷；不過最後的這句話，希望諸君必須牢記的，纔算這篇文章尙有些小意思。</p>

<p>主席各位同學、今天兄弟應現代思潮社之邀、到此地來講演、趁此機會和各位見面談話、覺得非常高興、今天我所講的是［新生活運動的知行問題］、此問題似乎太抽象不易講、因爲［知］［行］好像牽涉到哲學問題上去的、今將知行問題和新生活運動合起來研究一下、研究以後、就可知道新生活運動應該怎樣去做、找到了一條正確的路徑、就不致於傍徨和送惑了、於新生活運動的推進、是很有意義的、我現在分幾點來向各位說明、</p>
<p>第一新生活運動的史的說明有許多人說、新生活是舊生活之反面、新生活與舊生活相對待的、新生活是好的、那麽舊生活一定是不好的、但照我的研究、不是如此、因爲新生活要恢復禮義廉恥、而禮義廉恥在中國歷史上有長時期的發皇、那末舊生活不一定是壞的了、所以我主張應該分成三個名稱、一個是目前我們所說的［新生活］、一個是中國歷史上的［舊生活］、還有一個是近百年來才發展的［壞生活］、提倡新生活的原因、就是糾正壞生活、而要造成新生活、尤必須在歷史上所有的生活方式裏面找尋其優點、以供參考、所以此三種生活新生活是合乎現在時代、及我人生活環境的舊生活雖有其優點、但繁文縟節太多、也不合現代的人生、以新生活做標凖來談、則舊生活是太過、而壞生活則不及、過與不及、均不合我人的生活、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>項松茂先生的失踪，已有二年多了，從各方面事實的證明，項先生的被害，是無可疑了。敵人慘酷的毒手，無論那一個人，都是痛心切齒的憤慨。而社會上喪失一位慈祥和藹熱心國貨的項先生，尤其使國貨界處到很大的打擊，和很大的犧牲。猶記得五六年前記者在機聯會刋，曾撰[能幹哉松茂先生，每年挽回利權三百六十萬元]一文，一時投函欲謁見項先生和參觀其固本皂藥廠的，無慮二三百人。因爲沒有因本肥皂以前，我們日常所用的，都是外國肥皂。項先生本其毅力和雄心，從德人手中所辦的工廠，拿來自己經營，歷盡辛苦艱難，以有今日成就，又能自製新藥，以替代舶來的藥品，這種功績，安得不令人景仰佩服到五體投地？故如項先生的行爲，纔不愧爲國貨界的完人。在國貨史，可以千秋不朽了。希望國貨界同志，本着項先生的毅力和精神，來繼續項先生未完的事業。</p>
<h3 id="c224">大可注意之原產國標記條例 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>

<p>最近江海關布告云；[查進口貨原產國標記條例，展緩至本年七月一日施行，業於上年十一月二十二日布告在案，現奉政府令飭，進口貨原產國標記條例，應再展緩施行，俟有定期，再行飭遵。]云云。</p>
<p>看了這張布告，不由地起人疑懼起來，究竟這一而再而三的展緩，是誰的阻力，誰的意思？保障國貨惟一的生命綫，是靠這個條件，遏制劣貨改頭換面冒牌朦混的奸滑手叚，是靠這個條例，現在政府併這個起碼式的自定條例，還不敢施行，還不敢硬幹，國貨前途，還有什麽希望？唉，弱國無外交，現在連這關政都不能辦，可憐的是工廠，可憐的是國貨界。</p>
<h3 id="c225">國貨談話糖話 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>白糖，雖然不能和柴，米，油，鹽，醬，醋，茶，相提並論，然而也是家庭中不可一日缺的必需品。因爲吃甜的入，固然要和牠朝夕不離，就是不喜吃甜的人，燒起菜來，也要放一點糖，以調和口味，於是白糖也就成爲家庭的必需品了。</p>
<p>白糖，我國出產的很多，足可以供給全國的需用，但是後來因爲臺灣，被人家割據了，白糖的出產，突然减少。加之這幾年受了外貨洋糖的傾銷，排擠，弄得國貨糖業，一蹶不振。—其實這不但是糖業這樣，其餘的各業，也都受了外貨的排斥，一蹶不振。—並且中國人的習慣，向來是只知保守，不知研究改良。所以到現在的中國白糖，還是不白，而成爲黃色，不過顏色雖然是黃色，而糖味的確是比較洋糖甜。但是洋糖雖然不很甜，而顏色則的確很白，—簡直和雪一樣—不愧稱作白糖。大槪就因爲洋糖雪白的緣故，一般人都喜歡購用洋糖，於是洋糖的銷路，就很大了。據實業部國際貿易局，和海關方面的調查統計，每年洋糖進口的數量，竟達一千四百萬擔，價値一萬萬元以上，居外貨進口數量的第二位。你看這個數目，是多銷驚人啊—想不到這小小的白糖，一年竟會有這銷巨大的漏巵，而且那些提倡國貨的，竟也忽略了這一項，但是，現在要請提倡國貨的人們注意了！</p>
<p>白糖，據說是甘蔗作的。而我國的四川等省，因爲甘蔗太多，都把甘蔗晒乾，作爲引料，這不是太可惜了嗎？—見顧執中先生等的四川調查—希望我國的大實業家來注意一下，使我國的糖業，能够復興，不致再有這巨大的漏巵，那實在是國人日夜希冀而期待着的！</p>
<p>除掉洋糖以外，還有一種漏　巵，也是很可觀的。這是什麽呢？就是留蘭口香糖，據實業部的調查，每年竟有二百多萬的漏巵。而上海竟佔了二分之一，－一百萬元－天津大約有二十萬元，北平大約有十二萬元，其餘是銷在漢口等埠。－並且廣州省，福建省，和西南各省，還沒有統計在内。－試想這極微末的留蘭口香糖，每年竟有這許多漏巵，這不得不感謝那般摩登男士，時髦女郎了吧！</p>
<p>提倡國貨，先從這些微末的事作起，同胞們！努力吧！努力吧！</p>
<h3 id="c226">三個不同樣的人 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 柯定盫</p>
<p>現在有三個不同樣的人，請大家來檢視一下；</p>
<p>甲，穿嗶嘰長袍，直貢呢馬褂。乙，穿布的長袍，直貢呢背心。丙，穿春花呢西裝。</p>
<p>這樣的三個人，是我們中國人的極普遍的服裝，不過西裝在鄕鎭，並不是普遍的服裝，穿長袍馬褂或背心的人，可以說到處都是一樣的。</p>
<p>再說到長袍馬褂或背心，依着系統</p>
<p>來講，也有幾百年了，他的式樣，可說是祖傳！不但祖傳，可說是列祖列宗的傳下！在起先，都是中國的絲織品，如寗綢，紡綢，庫緞·····等等，穿起來，起碼幾十年，就譬如年老的人不要穿了，就拿來改改把兒子穿，兒子穿穿不要穿了，拿來改改把孫子穿，祖孫穿了三代，還沒有把那料子穿破，再拿來改改把孫子的弟弟穿，這是道道地地的中國貨，一穿幾十年，眞是何樂不爲呢！</p>
<p>現在就兩樣了，自己做了一件衣裳，常常穿不到幾個月，就是一個洞，或者花頭起毛了，或者顏色脫掉了，不要說穿不到幾十年，就是一年，都還勉强，據說這種穿不到一年的料子，却遠自外國來的外國貨呢？這眞是寃哉枉也！　　中國人應當穿經久耐用的中國貨，纔是不錯，爲什麽要去買不經久不耐穿的外國貨呢？這其中却有道理，［人之好勝，各處皆同，］惟其如此，一個人穿穿外國貨，引以爲榮，就有人去看樣，後來弄得百人千人萬人都是這樣，够了够了，大家以穿外國貨爲榮，中國貨沒有去路，漸漸的農產物價低落農村經濟破產，市景蕭條，失業日衆，危者殆者的境地，迎面而來了。</p>
<p>再來檢視甲，乙，丙三個人－</p>
<p>甲，他的嗶嘰長袍，做面子的嗶嘰，是外國貨，做裏子的駱駝絨是中國貨，馬褂直貢呢是外國貨。</p>
<p>乙，布長袍是中國貨，可是他的直貢呢馬褂是外國貨。</p>
<p>丙，一套西裝，是外國貨。</p>
<p>照以上看來，却都有些外國貨，可是中國貨的嗶嘰，直貢呢，春花呢，中國貨樣樣都有，那麽爲什麽不去採用呢？這全在乎自己一轉念間的事，那末爲什麽不穿國貨呢？我以爲最好在不久的將來，在三個人中，不至有不同樣的發現，換句話說，就是；［大家服用國貨，再不至有三個不同樣的人，而看到無論何處，都是一律服用國貨同樣的人了。］</p>

<p>歲月匆匆，［婦女國貨年］已去其三分之二了！這婦女國貨年點綴着這不景氣的商市，雖然覺得熱鬧許多，但是；利用牠明目張胆作推銷洋貨的工具，也數見不鮮！</p>
<p>婦女界裏的摩登姑娘，闊太太，視金錢爲無足重輕，隨便揀時髦貨買，用了沒有多時，又棄舊換新的再來揮霍！照這樣一輩子下去，要希望婦女界提倡國貨支票的兌現，眞是緣木求魚了！祗見她們很慷慨的兌現給外國人，還自以爲最聰明的女子呢，什麽脂粉，香水，口香糖這些東西，居然有驚人的數字！　　我願婦女界趕快覺悟，以兌現給外國人的錢，轉而爲婦女國貨年的國貨兌現，佔將來復興國貨史中最光榮的一頁！願婦女界速起圖之！</p>

<h3 id="c230">提倡國貨－建設漢口　爲國内自由市 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 張延祥</p>
<p>漢口原爲我國第二大商埠，現則降爲第六商埠，已退落在廣州天津之後，縱觀漢口地位與前相同，仍爲我國腹地之中心，但受各項環境之影響，以致衰敗。一則由隴海鐵路通至海州，西至潼關，故陜甘晋豫各省貨物，均由隴海東行，不經漢口，二則川江湘江輪船發達，由重慶宜沙以及長沙岳口，直達京滬，不由漢口轉駁，三則長江水道未曾整理，日形淤淺，而襄河逐年淤塞，貨物難暢其流，出口減少，此依交通方面而論，其他兵匪災害，東北淪亡，均爲漢口衰落之重要原因。現在一般人之觀察，以爲漢口之復興，將待粤漢鐵路株韶段工竣，全路通車之時，當可重執華中商業之牛耳，握南北交通之中樞，鄙意不然，粤漢鐵路期於四年通車，而玉萍鐵路，亦正趕築，將來滇桂湘黔貨物必由株州轉玉萍路，東出滬杭，比較從漢口轉江輪爲迅速便利，設將來東方大港能完成，則此路更比由長江下行爲短，故粤漢路與玉萍路同時完成，則漢口市塲毫無利益，且粤漢路完成，武漢鐵橋未建，江面遼闊，漲落約五十尺，卽使設備火車過江輪渡，比南京浦口間，困難倍蓰，一時難於實現，故從南段北來之貨，止於武昌，不能到漢，再由漢口地勢而論，濱江一帶，多屬漲灘，積淤泥沙，難泊大輪，將來起卸碼頭以及貨棧，必多設於武昌一邊，而漢口祗餘商塲而已，漢口地勢低窪潮濕，西北兩面，爲鐵道所阻隔，鐵道以外，全無市塲，鐵道以東，僅極狹地帶，已感擁擠擴充困難，將來工廠，决少設於漢口。</p>
<p>依照以上觀察，漢口市塲，根本難於復興，則提倡國貨，更多阻碍，因漢口市塲不發達，則工業不振，工業品專恃外埠輸入，市塲更形枯窘。且輸入之工業品及消耗品，均屬外貨，上海南京九江之國貨工業品及消耗品，亦不得來漢口，外國貨恃其關稅之保障，從上海運至漢口，無須重行納稅，我國貨在上海製造者，原料煤炭等進口，已經納關稅，其出品運來漢口，再須納關稅，實屬雙重稅制，而爲保護洋貨，侵奪國貨市塲之一種反保護稅制。（未完）</p>

<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>因爲要趕車，起了一個兩年以來所僅有的早。車是九點鐘開，十一點多就到了蘇州。坐上了一輛黃包車，可是因爲不曉得要到那里去，在拉到了　門馬路的時候，就要它停了下來。</p>
<p>可是眞不曉得要到那里去嗎？不，並不是不曉得，只是在躊躇。雖然想了這樣久要去看看－－小姐的，現在眞到了蘇州，却又决不定要不要去看她了。</p>
<p>關於－－小姐，嘗有好幾個人在我的面前稱讚過。嗣後我就留心她的文章－－的確不壞，就看到了的幾篇講。她的文章好在沒有酸氣，無論是文人的或者女子的。於是我總想去看看她，只苦得找不到什麽去看她的藉口。我不好意思對家裏說爲了要去看她特地跑到蘇州去，就是對我自己也不肯這樣作。那會太顯得鄭重，至少在她看來。而且我就從沒有這樣地去看過一個不認識的人，而且不經介紹地。對於她我却决定；不去看則已，去則一定不用介紹。我只是在等那藉口的來臨。而終於，它來了，那是我的一個親戚的結婚。我便决定了親自去道喜。在臨動身的前一晚，以電話從一個編輯那里得到了她的住址，雖然聽得不十分淸楚。</p>
<p>［想了這樣久要去看她的，爲什麽又不去看她？］一邊走，一邊在問着自己。</p>
<p>［－－灣認識？］終於脫口對一個在隨着來兜生意的車夫說［－－園？認識。是－－園。］</p>
<p>［在那里？］有些不信任。［在－－門内。］</p>
<p>那對了，－門我是聽凖了的車夫要我站住，等他去把車拉來。</p>
<p>［現在我還不要；我還得吃東西，］依舊躊躇着；我給了他幾個銅元，不要他的車。</p>
<p>［吃東西，我可以等，］他固執地說，並摧薦着這家菜館，那家點心店。</p>
<p>我還是回絶了他，便只顧自己走了。</p>
<p>可是在我吃好了點心，從一家店舗，依舊不很確定地，走出來的時候，看到了那車夫蹲在他的車了的踏板上等着。一見到我，他就站了起來，讓我走上車去。</p>
<p>我便這樣不費事地給那車夫的固執送到了－－－小姐的門前。</p>
<p>下了車，正見有一位小姐在拉門鈴，我以爲就是她，便告訴了她我要找誰。她說她在家裏；門開了，她便指引我到客廳裏去坐。</p>
<p>不久，－－小姐出來了。［哦，林先生，我們見過的，］她跨進了客進廳的門就笑着說。（未完）</p>

<p>— 大野</p>
<p>哥兒們閒着沒事，尋些事物消遺，許多舊玩具玩厭了，便大家說；弄文學吧。於是阿大揩乾鼻涕寫小說，阿二抛開皮球說；［你寫小說我便來批評］。阿三說；［我吸紙烟，便有紙烟文學］，阿細說；［我昨天聽了一個笑話，我便說笑話］。小毛女孩兒家，拿着鉛筆在圖畫紙上描花，咕咕噥噥，［你們都弄文學，我便弄藝術了］。於是一時都埋頭伏案，努力工作起來了。</p>
<p>大人們聽到孩了們都寂靜了，非常奇怪，一瞧都在埋頭伏案，便說；［讓他們去玩去吧！只不要鬧市事呵····］</p>
<p>且夫這麽一比擬，大人先生又將不高興矣！但請别要看輕了小孩！［人間世］不是莊子中的一篇名麽？卽以莊書爲例，其無爲之極致，大槪是還吾初服，化爲小孩。莊子是和老子一貫的，老子中並不反對［嬰兒］；世上不喜嬰	兒的，大槪是佛敎，眞言宗有［嬰童無畏心］，［愚童持齋心］與［異生羝羊心］並列。但這無妨。幽默大師并不信佛敎的。</p>
<p>看來今朝提倡幽默，明朝提倡吸烟，過一日反對痰迷詩，（雖則自己也扭扭揑揑恭和某老人一首，不見得非痰迷。）一忽兒又發現小品是文學正宗了。－－（這好像敗家子忽然在破櫃裏發現了一粒小珍珠，大嚷道；［這還能値錢］！）嗚呼！此［道兄］之所以爲［小孩］也！</p>
<p>夫［欲行大道，莫示小徑；無以大海内於牛跡，無以日光等彼螢火］！故作仁人義士，摩頂放踵，雖然可以不秘，但坐在黃河决口裏猶自飄飄然，却未免使人黯傷。如果提倡，還是比較偉大的東西較有意義吧！十四年來的小品文的成功是提倡小品的結果麽？抑是提倡比小品廣大一千倍的西洋文化的結果呢？</p>
<p>書店不銷西洋文學書，競出兒童敎科書和玩具了，賣者買者皆省力；剩水殘山中只能容衆狙似的［兒童］，無能爲力亦不爲力了。爲救社會起見，只剩了幽默和小品，勉之矣！</p>
<h3 id="c236">周作人詩讀法 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>近日有人登龍未就，在人言週刋，十日談，矛盾月刋，中華日報及自由談化</p>
<p>名投稿，系統的攻擊［人間世］，如野狐談佛，癩　談仙，不欲致辯。但自由談曾有他人一篇批評周作人先生個人態度，今日拜讀曹聚仁先生［周作人先生的自壽詩］，甚洽我心，覺有些話要說。昨得周先生與人間世稿，内附短簡云；·；得劉大杰先生來信，謂讀拙詩不禁凄然淚下，此種看法，吾甚佩服。（原函已轉劉先生，記其大意如此）余復周先生信，雖無存稿，大意如下·····此詩自是如此看法，寄沉痛於幽閒，但世間俗人太多，外間頗有訾議，聽之可也，惟自怪不應將此詩發表，放在傖夫堅子眼前耳。長沮桀溺乃世間熱血人，明人早有些語；····</p>
<p>所謂明人早有此語，係徐芳答傅瀛賓書中話，錄之於此；</p>
<p>弟賦性淺褊，於當世之務，又復　昧弗達，向來嘐嘐嘵嘵，非敢自鳴孤激，亦以同室之鬭，義無坐視。究竟絲髮奚裨，祗添一種罪案耳。扼豺虎之吭而奪之食，爲念雖切，識者笑其愚矣。自昔皆然。不止今日也。且楚狂沮溺，春秋之最冷人也。然味其言，非天下冷人也，而正天下之熱人。熱極矣，而無如何，則不得不歸於冷耳。極熱必極冷，此乘桴之所以嘆也。吾素最反對淸談亡晋之論，晋之亡不在阮藉猖狂，而在昏君暴主殺人如麻使阮藉不得不猖狂之環境。向來中國無民權，直言之士每死於宦閹之手，漢之黨錮，明之淸議，皆其例也。後之論史者，每謂淸談亡國，不啻爲逆閹洗煞，陋矣，且亦寃矣。夫飲酒猖狂，或沉寂無聞，亦不過潔身自好耳。今世癩鼈，欲使潔身自好者負亡國之罪，若然則［今日烏合，明日烏散，今日倒戈，明日憑軾，今日爲君子，明日爲小人，今日爲小人，明日復爲君子］之輩可無罪。孔子聖人尙有乘桴浮於海之嘆，今世癩鼈一股頭巾氣幾欲駕聖人而上之矣。</p>
<h3 id="c237">萬勝 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 草明女士</p>
<p>萬勝，我底一個同族的姐姐，有着圓而閃黑的靈活的眼睛，常常現着兩個笑渦的，豐滿的兩頰。這一副又柔媚，又跳動，又堅忍的面龐，經常地抵受着她底惡劣的遭遇：絲廠裏焙炙女工們底血液的蒸氣機；消磨她底靑春的酗酒的父親，和賭迷的哥哥。</p>
<p>我們鄕裏，生產方面，女人是佔主要地位的。男人們除了經營絲，繭，種桑，和做店員之外，其餘不是閒着就是跑到城市裏面去了。至於女人，一出世就被一般命運决定了，她們底生命力不是消磨在絲廠裏的就是耗費在桑畿上。我們底萬勝同樣地被命運磨折着；一方面就十足地表徵着這些獨立的，順德的女人們底特色－－自然不每個順德女人都如此－－接近過順德女人的人們，一定會在她底温柔中找出她底勇猛，在活潑裏找出她底堅决的性格的吧。</p>
<p>萬勝二十七八歲的時候，我只有她年齡底一半那麽大。因爲我家裏人曾經說再過一兩半便呌我跟她學師。所以，我對她慢慢留意起來。</p>
<p>在夏天，下午七點鐘左右，東溪河一個渡頭最高那級石階上，便可以找到萬勝底踪跡。她無力地捧住飯碗，無神地咀嚼着，讓疲弱的姿影投在黃濁的河水上面。有時候，她會放下碗筷，走下石階，把雙脚浸在水裏，眼睛厭煩而又憂慮地凝視着河面。</p>
<p>［我將來要做你底學徒，你高興麽］？一天在那渡頭石階上我跟她並排坐着，對她說了。</p>
<p>［你？唔，我勸你不要進絲廠了吧！］她决斷地說。［你還是趁早轉行的她。絲廠有什麽好處？－－簡直是一個火爐哩－－你這樣想想就得了，比方骨頭是樹枝，要是樹枝給火烤乾了漿汁變成炭條的時候，一敲就會斷的了。當眞，我們夜裏轉身的時候，那敢用力！］她呑了一口飯，强拉我吃了塊猪肉，機續說；［我們辛苦到晚，不要說好處了，吃得飽，穿的雖然粗衣麻布也算好了，可是，做不到吓！唔，這兒的女人們····吃苦，我們沒有做過錯事咯，我也不相信前世犯了罪這些事情的·····九妹，你年紀小哩，你還懂得不多。］我愛聽她這種帶點未熟的靑梅底酸澀的味道的話語。（未完）</p>

<p>— 風子</p>
<p>（一）聲</p>
<p>這幾年，在外面住久了，偶然回來，對於故鄕的一切，很多隔膜，心里老是缺憾似的，覺得總不像藏在記憶里的那樣親切了。有時想想，却又覺得時序依舊，景物也遺是依舊，甚麽都不曾改樣。</p>
<p>像換了　的燕子似的，惘惘地，惘惘地。</p>
<p>蛟川依舊在流，歲月一樣的在流過去，同學少年却都被生存的條件帶到都市里去了。這里只留下一些老的少的女的，有財產的土豪劣紳和沒錢出門的窮光蛋。有了這些人物，這里的空氣永遠只有沉悶。一方面是剝削和享樂，另一方面就是所謂［嚼着苦汁營生］。</p>
<p>使盡平生的氣力來運用極度的壓抑，和使盡平生的氣力來承受極度的壓抑，便形成這個無聲的鄕村。］</p>
<p>鄕村眞是［無聲］的，有，除非是舊曆年頭的爆竹聲，然而過了這個時期，也就不再聽見四十　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　風子　　　　了。現在，怕只有老年人對於世態人心的微弱的感喟吧！然而這成個甚麽聲音呢？</p>
<p>孩子們一年年大起來，一批批往都市跑，鄕村對於他們永逮只能留在腦袋里憧憬了。　下的大都是些十歲以下的。但十歲以下的孩子還是要大起來，還是要往都市跑。</p>
<p>再過多少時候，鄕村怕會變做沒有壯丁的區域吧！就是婦女，也有不少到熱鬧城市里去做工或帮傭的，但這里總算還留下了她們的大多數。</p>
<p>老年人的感喟對於這鄕村從來不曾發生過進步的效力　　　女們是連感　都沒有。她們只知道怎樣設法使這一天温飽，等到不能温飽的時候，就說是生成了這條苦命。</p>
<p>田里的工作在我們那兒的婦女是不做的，至多只會種些菜蔬。所以除了男人們從都市里能够寄些錢回來的外，婦女營生的方法，就只做成衣匠，賣菜蔬，可者養幾只雞蛋賣。白天为够，夜里再找些户内工作，雖在三更以後，連狗聲都寂的當兒，也還常常可以聽見［沙沙］地紡紗的聲音。</p>
<p>這該是代替她們嘴兒的僅有的聲音吧！</p>

<p>昨日西風括黃沙，掀開簾子望見她；窄窄腰兒小小脚，粉酡臉兒賽桃花。賣掉畝田，</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>父親和麗姑旋轉身子，預備走了，妹妹還咕噥着說；［我也要去的······］然而他們頭也不回的走了。麗姑還笑着對父親說一句什麽話，父氣點了點頭。孩子的心裏，這實在太悲哀了，父親爲什麽不肯呢？而且他們把抱怨父親的心，抱怨着麗姑了，要是她說了一句話，說不定把就會肯的，但麗姑一聲也沒有響。那悲哀，使哥哥哭了，於是妹妹也哭了起來。他十分抱怨着父親，前回說陪他們玩兩天，又是只玩一天，爸爸真不是好爸爸了；他多麽高興着陪麗姑去，可是他爲什麽不肯帶我們呢？麗姑又只會笑，不肯說一句好話，要是媽媽，一定帶去了！爸爸還說麗姑會愛我們的·····他越想越覺得苦憫，眼淚也越流越多了。妹妹帶着哭聲嚷道；</p>
<p>［哥，爸不帶我們去，我們明天不上學，我們呌陸媽陪去玩！］</p>
<p>［哥哥仍舊哭着，不答應妹妹的話，陸媽和王媽化了多大力量。才把他哄到了裏面去。］［我要媽媽的！］他停住哭，又跥着脚說。看看母親的照，又哭起來了。</p>
<p>臨睡時候，妹妹撅着嘴說；</p>
<p>［哥，麗姑不帶我們去，我不喜歡她了。］</p>
<p>哥哥望了她一下，也說；</p>
<p>［麗姑不愛我們的！］</p>
<p>孩子都睡了。在睡夢中，那哥哥看見媽媽抱着妹妹，媽媽給她講神仙的故事，妹妹倚在媽媽的懐裏微微地搖着身子。他一個人在拍皮球，媽媽喊他說；［明，你的乎拍得這樣髒了，快聽媽媽講故事吧！］他便停止着聽了一會，媽媽微笑地擺着身子，嘴裏不住的講。忽的妹妹打斷了媽媽的故事說；</p>
<p>［媽媽，我們吃什麽點心呢？］</p>
<p>［啊，今天媽媽沒有做，好乖乖，聽完了故事吧！］</p>
<p>［我要的！］妹妹的小手輕輕撫着媽的臉說。</p>
<p>於是媽媽在抽屜中拿了許多美麗的軟糖和餅乾，分給他們。但他一回頭媽就不見了，他便大聲的喊媽媽，到處去找。她像是媽媽答應着他，把他抱着了，一張眼，抱他的却是爸爸呢！［醒醒吧，明不要哭，爸爸抱着呀！］</p>
<p>但孩子一聽他的話，更哭得兇了。</p>
<p>［媽媽沒有了，我要媽媽的！］他喊着。</p>
<p>［有爸爸在這裏呢，不要哭！］父親這樣說着，那一顆眼淚正滴在孩子的頰上。</p>
<p>［媽媽沒有了！］孩子伏在父親的肩頭，悲傷地飲泣。（完）</p>

<p>— 姑射</p>
<p>目前國家正是到了危急存亡千鈞一髮之。是本的拿中國放在手裏任意搓揑，國際帝國主義在遠東互相鬭爭的緊張程度，差不多達到了空前未有的尖銳點。中國在這時才眞正做了［爼上之肉，宰割由人］，。國民們！大家也覺得目前眞是［大難臨頭］了嗎？</p>
<p>回顧九一八以來，當初我們的民氣是何等緊張。反日會，義勇軍，請願，遊行，差不多每一個人都激漲起了全身的血脈，從事救國運動。奔走呼號，熱烈至於極點。而現在則一聲不聞了。國難的程度，一天一天增加，相反的，國民救國的熱情，却一天一天低落。這是一種什麽現象？這才是眞正的亡國現象！國家的危難不足慮，國民的頽廢，到了如此的程度，這才眞是足以亡國而有餘！</p>
<p>國民們不要以爲［亡國］［亡國］，喊了這麽幾十年，［共管］［瓜分］，聽了這麽久，而國終究還沒有亡，國終究還沒有被［共管］，終究還沒有被［瓜分］，現在還不是一樣，儘管危機緊張到甚麽程度，我們一樣會得渡過去的，急什麽呢？這是最大的錯誤，最不可挽救的亡國心理！須知，以往的所以還沒有被［瓜分］，還沒有被［共管］，名義上國還沒有亡，並不是因爲我們還有可以自存之理，而是他們還沒有由事實上的瓜分與共管就進而作名義上的瓜分與共管之必要，就是說，他們還不需要就立刻實行名義上的瓜分或共管，他們之間還有均勢在維持着，儘可靠這均勢來和平的平均剝中國。而現在則大不然了。遠東均勢，早因日本九一八的行動而打破，一方，帝國主義危機的尖銳化，也有迫使他們非更加加緊的分割殖民地不可。世界殖民地，至十九世紀末至，早已分割凈盡，其問經過一九一四至一八年的世界大戰，而有二次的分配，現在所剩下來的，就只有我國一國了。中國在事實上雖早已分配於列强各國，然名義上尙保持獨立，現在他們所討論的，就是怎樣從事實上的瓜分而實行名義上的瓜分，大家索性在中國劃出一塊土地，標上某國所領字樣，派駐總督大臣治理。而日本就首先實行了這一計劃。跟着日本之後，各國難保不要［如法泡製］，這樣，形成了最近列强對中國爭奪戰的激烈局面。中國爭奪戰的結果，當然很容易的中國由事實止的淪亡再進而爲名義上的淪亡，簡直的直屬於各國。這是必然的道路。須知，這是帝國主義發展到最後期必然的結果！帝國主義危機發展到最　點　　殖民地的分割載，也　激烈，不到帝國正義最後的倒　，這分割　戰一日不會停止。國人們，這危機的深化，大家也該認淸楚了嗎？</p>
<p>帝國主義間的鬭爭，一日尖銳一日，中國被分割的程度，也一日高漲一日，相信不久的將來，帝國主義的魔手，會伸到中國來眞的把我們的地圖一塊一塊撕碎。國民們，大家也覺得這危機的程度已經達到了可怕的頂點了嗎？頽廢與享樂，挽救不了我們的靈魂，起來罷！早早覺悟，來共謀一個自救的出路！</p>

<p>，派遣來華留學，該生等訂於本月二十二日午前十時，由東京車站出發赴神户，於二十五日由神户乘連絡船來華，該少年井上伸一等，年齡均爲十四歲，内中七人當往天津，就學於中日學院，其餘三人，預定入漢口之江漢中學求學，並擬在華將來投考中國之大學，預定留學十年畢業後，以六年爲義務年限，使之就事，以便澈底理解中國。］</p>
<p>派遣學生到外國留學，本是極平常的事，値不得大驚小怪。可是日人的舉動，總有幾分詭秘，敎人莫測高深。就像他們這回要送人到我國來讀書，目的却並不在求學，而是要使之澈底理解中國，這不是有用意嗎？難道他們口頭上不時在嚷着中日親善，對於我國情狀，竟是這樣不理解，而必等待十年後這十位由日本全國挑選出來的英俊少年來理解？不是的，他們在理解上面，還加上澈底二字。原來他們對於中國，理解是理解的，不過理解不澈底吧了，故今番特地　這幾位日童來留學，希望將來能對我國理解得澈底些　，　一　到達一　息，不禁悲喜交集。悲者，當現下日本對我國尙未有理角澈底之前，我們已喪失一塊偌大的土地了，萬一他日埋解澈底之後，我們這個老大的中國，恐怕就要保不住了。喜者，或者日本一向之所以欺侮我國，是因爲對我國沒有理解澈底使然，幸而將來他們理解澈底了，會把搶去的失地交還我們，眞實和我們稱着大哥賢弟的親熱起來。好在這十位日靑年就要光臨敝國來了，我們不妨暫將國家的命運寄托在他們身上吧！</p>
<p>說起留學生，又使我們觸動了許多感想來。我國不是年年也派遣一批批學生到歐美或日本去留學，不是年年也有不少留學生由歐美或日本回來的嗎？但是他們帶給我們的是些什麽，我們眞說不出來。他們之間，不知道有沒有人能澈底理解外國？大槪總是理解的多吧，因爲我國的留學生，自來就有一個共同的傾向，倘他是留學美國的，歸國之後，他就倡着親美論，倘他是留學英日的，歸國之後，他就倡起親英親日論。沒有澈底理解，他們怎樣會主張和人家親善呢？更有倡賣國論的，我國近來所產生的那些漢奸和一班媚人派，他們從前都是留學過日本的。照此推論起來，這幾個帶有重大使命留學來華的日本少年　　來學成歸　後，想不至會於我國不　的　我們等　　！我們謹在此先　他們表示一些歡迎之意！</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Government Holds Three Meetings in One Day, Preparing to Follow Britain in Launching Action Against Japan; Secretary of State Hull Issues Ultimatum Upon Return to Capital; Our Foreign Ministry Reiterates Solemn Position <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, responsible sources declared that the U.S. will, following Britain, officially notify Japan, urging it to heed its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's declaration has already caused disputes sufficient to brew a major Far Eastern situation. Now, repeated conversations by Japanese diplomats with journalists have further expanded this situation. It is said that U.S. officials will not only question Japan about its ambitions and urge it to heed treaty obligations, but will also demand an explanation for the statement by the Japanese Consul-General in Geneva, Yokoyama, that the U.S.-owned Philippines, British India, the Asian part of Soviet Russia, the Dutch East Indies, and China are countries with which Japan intends to cooperate to maintain peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull will return to Washington from New York today. Hull's return to the capital will be the day the U.S. government launches its action against Japan. The U.S.'s action will either be a direct ultimatum to Japan or instructions to U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, to inquire.</p>
<p>Under Secretary of State Phillips held three meetings on the current situation today. The first was a meeting with President Roosevelt at the White House. No public announcement was made regarding the decisions made. The second was a meeting with officials from the State Department's Far Eastern Division. The third was a meeting between the Under Secretary of State and Japanese Ambassador Saito, lasting over an hour. It is understood that during the meeting, the Under Secretary of State asked Ambassador Saito to explain Japan's new policy towards China as reported in the newspapers. The Under Secretary of State also held brief consultations with the British and French Ambassadors.</p>
<p>The actions of the Japanese in publicizing statements only made to newspapers throughout the world have aroused extreme resentment among U.S. officials, who consider this issue the most important development in the Far East since Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to China in 1915. What U.S. officials find particularly unsettling is that Ambassador Saito made a lengthy statement to journalists yesterday, containing important insinuations, but disregarding government officials. The British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement that Japan's declaration must be officially clarified has been unanimously agreed upon here. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(London) Chinese Envoy to Britain Guo Taiqi's visit to U.S. Ambassador to Britain Bingham today reveals that, after Japan's declaration, various countries are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, causing anxiety in China. It is understood that Envoy Guo was unable to make Ambassador Bingham express the U.S.'s position. It is reported that the U.S. Ambassador replied to Guo, saying that he had not yet received instructions from the State Department regarding this matter. As Envoy Guo returned to the embassy, Chinese Envoy to the U.S. Shi Zhaoji sent a cable reporting that the lack of activity in Washington was due to Secretary of State Hull's trip to New York and the absence of any formal communication from Tokyo. However, Shi seemed to have received assurances from U.S. officials, so he continued in his cable, "[The State Department's attitude of maintaining the dignity of treaties has not changed.]" Before visiting Ambassador Bingham at 5 p.m. today, Guo exchanged views with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. Guo intended to explore why Japan issued its declaration claiming to be the protector of peace in the Far East at this time. According to a major diplomat who spoke to the Associated Press, there were many causes for the Hirota Declaration, and the daring rescue of the victims of the Chizukesu tragedy by Soviet pilots was the main reason for prompting this. The Soviet pilots' rescue on April 13 was a powerful demonstration of the strength of the Soviet Air Force, shocking Japan, which then issued its statement to the world on April 18, intending to divert Soviet attention, saying that Japan is currently focused on China and does not value Siberia.

<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador Saito and Under Secretary of State Phillips held a brief meeting today to discuss Japan's statement on its China policy. It is understood that Saito did not send a formal notice to Phillips, but said that he had not been instructed by his government to visit the Under Secretary. He also did not expect the Tokyo Foreign Ministry to instruct him to forward any formal documents regarding Japan's policy to the State Department. He also said that the statement issued in Tokyo on April 17 was merely a reaffirmation of a well-known policy. Japanese officials were quite surprised that there was such a reaction in capitals around the world. Foreign Minister Hirota had previously announced this policy in the Diet, and foreign diplomats who heard it had never criticized it. Japan does not want to completely close the open door in China to exclude other countries, but Japan will insist that any foreign country or foreigner must consult with Japan before establishing any relations with China that may be detrimental to Japan. Saito told reporters afterwards that he and Phillips did not discuss Japan's policy, nor did they discuss the application of Japan's policy to U.S. interests in China. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After meeting with U.S. Under Secretary of State Phillips today, Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Saito told visitors, "[I have declared that Japan has no intention of undermining the Nine-Power Treaty,"] However, he had explained to Phillips that Japan requires countries to consult with Japan before investing in or supplying goods to China. Phillips declined to comment on the contents of the meeting. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Foreign Ministry Re-articulates Solemn Attitude Toward Japan; China's Sovereignty and Independent National Character Will Not Tolerate Damage or Interference from Any Country <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the statement issued by the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry on April 17, the Japanese side summarized and explained the points explained by the spokesperson to our diplomatic authorities on the 24th, stating: (1) Japan sincerely hopes for the preservation, unification, and prosperity of China, and will absolutely not obstruct or harm China's independence or interests; (2) Japan welcomes foreign countries trading with China for economic or commercial relations, and Japan will further abide by various agreements related to China, and at the same time hopes that China will honestly implement the principles of equal opportunity and open door; (3) Japan has no intention of harming foreign interests in China, but if foreign countries jointly confront East Asia and take actions that violate the order and peace of East Asia, Japan will only vehemently oppose it. The above is the natural attitude that Japan, which has the responsibility of jointly maintaining the peace and order of East Asia with China and other East Asian countries, should take. In other words, if the nations and the League of Nations confront China with an attitude of jointly managing China, it will only be excluded. The spokesperson of our Foreign Ministry stated that the above points stated by the Japanese side do not fully conform to the content of the original statement of the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 17th, and although the Japanese responsible authorities have repeatedly made various explanations of the original statement at home and abroad, which either clearly contradict the original text or are more profound than the original text, they have never denied the original statement. The Japanese government should be responsible for the original statement. As for China's position, it has been expressed by our spokesperson in a statement on the 19th. The statement clarified China's solemn attitude on the responsibility of maintaining peace, cooperation between China and other countries, and the relations between China and Japan. What should be further explained is that China's sovereignty and its independent national character will not allow any country to damage it with any excuse. All relations between China and other countries or the League of Nations are in accordance with the law and based on China's own development and security, and will not allow any country to interfere with any excuse. Japan is overly concerned that the nations and the League of Nations will confront China with an attitude of joint management. Neither the League of Nations nor the nations have any intention of what Japan is concerned about. China, with its independent dignity, cannot tolerate the joint management forces that bind China for a moment, just as it cannot tolerate the independent binding forces of any country. The reason is clear and the righteousness is correct. Moreover, when China began to cooperate with the League of Nations, Japan had not yet announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations. Japan had long supported the policy of China's cooperation with the international community. Is Japan now legally still a member of the League of Nations? Japan hopes that China will implement the principles of equal opportunity and open door. Regarding China's economic relations with other countries, China has no intention of excluding any country. However, the motivation for initiating this principle was originally to prevent any country from monopolizing its economic and other relations in any region by virtue of its special power and excluding other countries. Now, according to the Japanese statement, Japan clearly wants to exclude the legitimate relations of other countries with China. Then the responsibility for the shake-up of the open-door policy lies not in China but in Japan. In short, China is now striving internally to eliminate banditry and engage in production and construction work, and externally to guarantee international security and maintain international treaties such as the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty. The progress of internal work does not allow interference from other countries, and the implementation of external policies depends on the cooperation of related countries, and it is hoped that the inviolability of international law and the sacred dignity of treaties will be jointly maintained. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, after Japan issued the so-called anti-assistance policy to China's construction on the 17th, it has aroused great attention from European and American countries. Yesterday, Reuters Tokyo reported that the Japanese cabinet had approved the non-formally issued declaration on the 17th. However, our diplomatic authorities have not yet seen this kind of formal document, so it is difficult to determine whether the declaration on the 17th and the content of the cabinet's approval on the 24th that the East Asian peace policy will not be changed are of the same nature, so no comments will be issued for the time being. However, regarding this issue, it is expected that Rassman will present a detailed opinion report at the League of Nations technical conference, and our country will have Gu Weijun as a representative to attend.

<p>(London) This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons in response to questions from members of parliament regarding the Far Eastern issue that he did not want to criticize before receiving a reply from Tokyo. However, he stated that the repeated declarations of new policies by Japanese officials recently have increased disputes in the situation, and it is difficult to say which of these repeated declarations is based on. The British Cabinet held a cabinet meeting this morning. Although there was no public announcement afterwards, all parties deeply believe that what was discussed was nothing more than the disarmament conference and the Far Eastern situation. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Leeds Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution today, requesting the British government to do its utmost to protect British interests in China. This proves that British merchants are extremely apprehensive about Japan's announced new policy towards China. The mover of the motion stated that a forceful approach should be taken to maintain the opening of the door in China for trade, because if Japan applies the principles applied to Manchuria to the entire China, then our trade with China can only be said goodbye. According to dispatches from Washington, the United States will at least remain silent and watch any international disputes caused by Japan's declaration on April 17 for the time being. Under Secretary of State Phillips was asked whether the United States had the possibility of cooperating with Britain to try to rectify the current situation in China and Japan, and his answer was completely irrelevant, or he was told that the Chinese envoy to Britain Guo Taiqi had consulted with the U.S. Ambassador to Britain Bingham on the Japanese declaration. When Phillips heard this, he said that the U.S. government had not sent instructions to Bingham, and Bingham had not reported to the State Department the situation of talking with any officials.

<p>(Geneva) The news that the Japanese Cabinet has approved the [no meddling in China] policy is seen here as having created a new situation, which will have extremely serious consequences for international trade, and is a direct challenge to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. There is now reason to believe that Japan is extremely anxious about the activities of League of Nations economic expert Dr. Raschmann. Raschmann is currently on his way back here from China. It is said that his report not only contains a plan for technical cooperation with China, but also contains far-reaching political suggestions. Therefore, Japan's declaration is actually intended as a warning to the League of Nations to discuss Raschmann's report. According to a Japanese spokesperson in Geneva, Japan's position is that of a doctor at the bedside of a sick China. Although there are other doctors treating it, only the Japanese doctor can prescribe the right medicine. The rest are mediocre doctors, and the prescriptions they prescribe are only enough to increase its fever. (Shanghai Times Special Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Second World War and Our Countermeasures <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>There were many who spoke of the outbreak of the Second World War when Japan forcibly occupied our Northeast Provinces. Moreover, they believed that it would certainly be in the East. Until recently, due to the emergence of new problems between countries in the international arena, the focus of attention shifted, and the previously extremely tense Far Eastern problem was invisibly eased. The call for a second world war also gradually disappeared. Those who discussed international politics also mostly suspected that the second world war would break out in Europe first. In fact, if our Northeast problem is not resolved for a day, the powder keg of the Far East will not be extinguished for a day. The reason why various countries with the most significant interests in the Far East have been preparing for war with such urgency over the past year is that their attitude towards Japan has not relaxed. The meaning of Britain's efforts over the past two years to expand its naval budget and quickly complete the Singapore naval base is self-evident. As for the United States, although it has promised the independence of the Philippines, the 102-ship naval bill passed by its Congress is the only grand undertaking since the Washington Conference. Who can believe that its intention is to protect itself and does not want to interfere in Japan's actions in the Far East. As for France, which owns the Annam colony in the Far East, the increase in its naval budget is also astonishing. According to the French naval budget, in 1933-34 it was only 2,717,000,000 francs. The budget passed by Congress on March 6 of this year increased to 9,013,000,000 francs. It can be seen that its intention is not unwilling to intervene in the Far Eastern issue either. As for the Soviet Union's preparations for war against Japan, they have been repeatedly seen in newspapers, and are particularly obvious. In summary, it can be seen that the silence of various countries in the past was to bury their heads and prepare their strength in preparation for the Second World War. The reaction since the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on China seems that the intentions of various countries are no less dim than during the September 18th and January 28th Incidents.</p>
<p>Therefore, the outbreak of the Second World War is really a matter of time. Moreover, the fuse for its outbreak is feared to still be centered on the Far Eastern issue. If Japan occupies the Northeast for a day, the balance of power of Britain, the United States, France, and Russia in the Far East will inevitably become unbalanced. The economic interests of various countries in China are not only in danger of being monopolized by Japan, but the territories of Britain, the United States, France, and Russia in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are also in danger of being eroded by Japan in turn. Therefore, their desire to limit the excessive expansion of Japan's power is also inevitable. It is particularly obvious in Britain's current advocacy of upholding the Nine-Power Treaty and the unanimous criticism of Japan by public opinion in various countries. It is only difficult to predict when the war between European and American countries and Japan will break out. Judging from the general trend, if the issue of the balance of power in the Far East and the issue of the naval ratio between Britain, the United States, and Japan cannot be resolved at the Second Pacific Conference, they can all accelerate the outbreak of war in the Far East.</p>
<p>What policy will our country adopt under this situation? This is something that deserves our deep attention. If such a major war occurs in the Pacific, if we stay out of it and sit back and watch the success or failure, then no matter which side wins, China will be in danger of being controlled by others. If Japan wins, then we will be subject to Japan's independent control. If Japan loses, then we will also sit and wait for the division of the powers. Therefore, once a major war breaks out, it will not allow our country to remain neutral and not allow our country not to participate in the war. What our country can choose is only whether to stand on the side of the powers or on the side of Japan. Judging from the history of the past few decades, the reason why China has been able to survive to this day is thanks to the balance of power of the powers. If the balance of power exists, China can still survive. If the balance of power is broken, then China is unthinkable. Only because of this, China's coping policy is not conducive to the independent strength of one country, but conducive to the balance of power of the powers. The reason why various countries do not directly oppose Japan but have risen up to prepare their strength is to maintain their balance of power in the Far East. Once the balance of power is broken, the powers will inevitably seek their own interests and compete for their power in the Far East, and we will be in greater danger. If we understand this point, then before this world war breaks out, our country must have some consideration and preparation.</p>
<p>In short, standing on the world, no one can survive independently without relying on alliances with countries. Moreover, when China is in such a difficult situation, it is especially important to maintain those who can sympathize with us internationally. The diplomatic policies of various countries will certainly not be easily expressed. The temporary joy and anger of the diplomatic authorities cannot be used to peek into their true intentions. Therefore, those in power cannot determine our policy based on the temporary situation. However, allying with more countries is a certain and unchanging beneficial principle in diplomacy. What we are saying is not to rely on international assistance. Relying on others while not making arrangements ourselves is the way to mislead the country. It is necessary to use the international situation on the one hand, use agile diplomatic skills to plan and cope well, and on the other hand, base on our own consistent diplomatic policy and strive to prepare our strength, so that we will not be at a loss when the opportunity comes in the future.</p>

<p>Saito's so-called "unfriendly behavior"</p>
<h3 id="e10">If a Bomb Were Thrown at London, It Would Have the Same Globally Shocking Significance as the So-called "Serious Consequences" of 1924 <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(London) In the past ten years, Saito is the second Japanese ambassador to the U.S. to use a tone that has shocked the world and has been seen as having great significance. When the U.S. Congress passed the Immigration Act in 1924, the Japanese ambassador to the U.S. at the time was Hanihara, who called the move would have serious consequences, and was fatally struck in his political career. Saito issued a statement in Washington yesterday, saying that if foreign countries ignore Japan's application to consult with Japan before establishing any collusion with China, Japan will regard it as an unfriendly act. Such a statement would be like a bomb thrown at London, which not only would not weaken the impact of the [no meddling in China] declaration issued by Tokyo on April 17, but would make it even more serious.</p>
<p>Observers here recalled the words of a spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs who told reporters on April 20 that the declaration of Japan's intention not to allow interference in China had caused a reaction all over the world, which was quite surprising. It is important to know that this is only an extension of the speech made by Foreign Minister Hirota in the Diet in January, etc. It is believed that the issuance of this statement is intended to change public opinion, because Japan has seen that those in power in various countries around the world are disturbed by Japan's declaration, so there is a tendency to ease its attitude. However, Saito's statement has the opposite effect. People here see China's reaction to Japan's declaration as being too neutral, but political commentators are amazed at the power of the outcry, because Far Eastern public opinion is now ready to be launched. As for the stock market, Japanese stocks are slightly weak, but this is not important. Whenever any shocking news occurs in the Far East, the market will show this phenomenon. As for China, it must be very worried about Japan's declaration, fearing that the national construction plan will be affected. If foreign assistance is indeed restricted, then the construction of roads, railways, and other development plans may be seen by Japan as containing the danger of hindering peace in the Far East. According to well-informed sources in London, Japan's declaration is aimed directly at China, and other countries are secondary. This was aroused by the failure to agree on a solution to the problems of traffic and postal services at the Nanchang Conference. Members of the China Committee who are members of Congress are quite suspicious of Japan's declaration, and they all say that its wording is indeed strict. They will try their best to put this matter before the Congress and urge the government to resist any infringement of the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees China's territorial and administrative integrity. At the same time, according to Washington news, the United States will never be directed by Japan. However, the United States' feelings about the Chinese domestic situation have recently changed greatly. The State Department will try its best to act cautiously to avoid any tension in relations between the U.S. and Japan. Reporters in the U.S. capital all say that it is difficult to expect the State Department to make any suggestions in Tokyo as Stinson did when he was in power.

<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, Britain may suspend the scheduled British-Japanese trade negotiations due to the disputes in the Far Eastern situation. British Ministry of Commerce officials did not comment on this news. However, according to the British Chamber of Commerce Federation, it intends to convene a sub-committee to hold a special meeting as soon as possible to discuss Japan's commercial competition and its announced new policy towards China. Influential figures in British business circles are reportedly very opposed to conducting British-Japanese trade negotiations at present, because they deeply believe that the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty may therefore not support Britain's negotiations with Japan in this tense situation. Therefore, British-Japanese trade negotiations will be suspended for several weeks. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(New York) A New York newsletter today editorialized, titled Japan, Which Is Acting Wrongly, severely criticized Japan's policy toward China, saying that the more Japan speaks about its proposed policy, the more cowardly and treacherous its words become. The more uncomfortable the situation that Japan is creating in the Pacific, the more important point is that Japan has already violated the extremely important international treaty it signed, resulting in the loss of world credibility. Now it is exploring purely oriental tricks, sending children to present a proud and rude challenge to the world with an extremely dishonest attitude. The New York Daily News compared Japan's policy tone with Germany's before the war, saying that if Japan continues to turn those who are its friends into its enemies, it will eventually follow in Germany's footsteps.

<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's organ newspaper attacked the newspaper and commented on the Far Eastern issue, stating: [Since the European War, Japan's desire to develop land and promote markets has not been concealed. Japan's trade in North and South America, Central Asia, and India has lowered prices, causing merchants everywhere to be disturbed. If there is a conflict in the Far East, Germany has no reason to interfere if it is not necessary. However, we do not want to lose our commercial relationship with China and Japan. Our Germany has no capital to use for adventures in the Far East. Washington hopes that Britain will promote joint action to deal with Japan.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the true meaning of the unofficial statement on Japan's policy towards China on the 17th, Foreign Minister Hirota has adopted a policy of taking advantage of opportunities to fully explain it to the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Tokyo. He has already provided subtle and frank explanations to Soviet Ambassador Yurenev, Chinese Minister Jiang Zuobin, and several others who had been informally notified. The points Hirota emphasized in his explanation are: (1) Japan's special position and responsibility in East Asia have been demonstrated by numerous historical facts since the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. (2) This statement is merely to prompt other countries to re-recognize this special position and does not differ from past policies or actions.

Two bandits and an old Japanese woman who harbored the bandits were captured by the Japanese police station. The two bandits have been extradited by the French Municipal Council. The old Japanese woman was not extradited due to the protection of the Japanese consulate. This case was solved thanks to a report from the driver of car number 1376 to the Japanese police station. The car was rented by the bandits from the Taiyo Motor Company in the Japanese Concession. The driver, fearing involvement, reported the bandits' address to the police. Detectives from the Japanese station went to the address, the third floor of Xiangyuan Lane on Mishima Street in the Japanese Concession, and captured the bandits. Hongji was still in the room and was sent back along with the bandits. (Special Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Colon, Canal Zone. The highest record for the rapid passage of the U.S. fleet through the Panama Canal was broken today. Warships passed through in single file, a length of about 200 miles, starting at Balboa on the Pacific coast and reaching Colon on the Atlantic coast. This redeployment began yesterday morning and, according to an emergency order from Commander-in-Chief Cellars, will be entirely completed today. Commercial ships are currently moored on the west side of the isthmus, and there may be more ships arriving today, all of which will have to wait for the warships to complete their transit of the canal. (25th National Telegram) Balboa (Panama Canal Zone) The ambition of the U.S. Navy and Army has ordered all departments to research and try to sail one hundred and eleven warships through the Panama Canal and into the Atlantic Ocean within 24 hours, causing thirty ships, including the British cruiser Exeter, to halt their forward journey today. This action by the U.S. Navy is part of the recent twelve-day tactical exercise in the South Pacific. This special move has never been attempted before. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>China United Press Taipei Correspondence: On the afternoon of April 12th, eleven warships were discovered sailing north off the coast of Hualien Port. The Yilan Police Department and the Shanghai Naval Attaché stationed in Taipei received the news and dispatched a small boat to pursue them, but they were unable to find any trace of the strange warships. The Shanghai Attaché immediately reported to the Magong Naval Base Command. The authorities believed that they were destroyers of the U.S. Navy in the Philippines, but they did not violate territorial waters, and the truth was not obtained, so nothing could be done. Because of this incident, the people of Taiwan are quite panicked.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Army, in order to prepare for air raids on the capital, strongly feels the need to establish a Defense Command during peacetime to prepare for air defense and is currently studying it. The proposed costs are: 1 million yuan for construction of the Defense Command, 500,000 yuan for internal equipment, and 500,000 yuan for land acquisition, totaling 2 million yuan.

<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Lin is steadily proceeding with preparations to establish the Army's own national defense policy. Once his original proposal is established, he will meet with various ministers separately to exchange opinions in order to realize this national policy. Minister of the Army Lin has always maintained an attitude of absolute support for Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic efforts. It is said that Minister of the Army Lin's views on diplomatic issues are as follows:</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Lin absolutely supports Foreign Minister Hirota's ongoing work of foreign friendship. At the same time, he is always cautious and pays attention to his own words and actions to avoid causing misunderstandings by foreign countries. In other respects, he actively engages in friendship work whenever the opportunity arises, so that the major powers fully understand Japan's true intentions. The Minister of the Army also hopes that China and Russia, which bear the same responsibility for maintaining peace in the Far East, will exercise self-respect and maintain friendly relations with Japan. Japan's diplomatic policy has always been based on friendship. Even if it is necessary to express national indignation and resolutely resist, in normal times diplomacy should never be based on the ideal of "forty-three against one" in the League of Nations. (25th China United Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before assuming office, Minister of the Army Lin examined Japan's profound crisis and felt that it was necessary to adjust diplomatic, national defense, and internal affairs issues. He is currently studying countermeasures. Recently, he decided to realize his specific plans and take the opportunity to implement the three major policies decided by the cabinet, fully incorporating the Army's opinions into these policies in order to expand them and use them as a solid plan. Minister of the Army Lin knows that internal affairs meetings and other meetings have had weak effects in the past, and he has decided to negotiate directly with each cabinet member. He will first meet with Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai and Foreign Minister Hirota to coordinate everything. (25th Electric Communications Dispatch)</p>

<p>Madrid. The Lerroux Radical Cabinet resigned en masse at noon today because it did not approve of President Zamara's political amnesty bill. Disturbances have occurred throughout the country in recent days. General strikes and semi-revolutionary political unrest have occurred in Madrid, San Sebastian, and other major cities. Political observers say that the cabinet's mass resignation may lead to a serious government crisis. Premier Lerroux declared after submitting his resignation that his cabinet had decided to oppose the president's amnesty bill because the cabinet clearly no longer had the president's trust. The amnesty bill included General Chappuis, who had committed serious treason and was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. After accepting the resignation, the President immediately convened a meeting of leaders of various political parties to seek new figures to form a cabinet. (25th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Reasons for the Fall in Silver Prices (London) London financiers believe that the fall in silver prices is due to the failure of the silver faction in the United States because President Roosevelt refused to adopt their proposals. Financiers also believe that, given the current world situation, the normal price of silver should be around 18.5 to 19 pence. China is the most important factor in the silver market. China has recently kept silver prices about one penny below parity, so the sale by the United States will bring silver prices in line with Chinese prices. The London silver market was stable after the listing of silver prices today. (Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Speculators' Efforts Fall Short (New York) Foreign speculators intended to use a surprise attack to cause the U.S. dollar to fall, but today this plan has completely failed. Since last Friday, their manipulation plan has begun to be active, and the value of the dollar has gradually fallen. Foreign speculators all thought that success was at hand, but unexpectedly, on Saturday morning, the Ministry of Finance suddenly issued a notice stating that the U.S. government had decided to maintain the gold price so that it would match the dollar's price, resulting in failure.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt does not seem to be eager to engage in new experiments on monetary issues. Originally, the president had great hopes for the policy of buying gold abroad and devaluing the dollar, but judging from his recent declarations, it can be said that he has expressed disappointment. Since this policy has not had the expected effect on gold, it does not seem that it will be effective on silver either. Some observers point out that President Roosevelt is now skeptical of the new theories of Professor Warren of London (who proposed buying gold). Warren's name is no longer mentioned, and the President's attitude towards monetary and price-raising issues is now very conservative, probably for this reason. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the silver faction in Congress is enthusiastic and taking the offensive, the 25 members of the Senate Presiding Officers, led by Laboring, today compiled the Senate agenda for the future and removed the silver issue.

(24th Havas Telegram) (Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today sent the Senate a list of silver depositors in the country, mostly large companies and banks, such as Manhattan Bank with 11 million ounces of silver, Chase National Bank with 4 million ounces, and certain prominent individuals also on the list. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the Ministry of Finance released the list of silver depositors in the country this afternoon, large quantities of silver were sold off in the market, causing silver prices to plummet. Regarding the release of the list, the financial community believes that it is not surprising that the list includes many large banks and silver brokerage firms, because these companies all have important business relationships with the Far East. Although they sometimes engage in speculative behavior, the government does not need to accuse them of speculation. Currently, some in the Senate are beginning to advocate for an investigation into silver speculation. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e73">London Disarmament Talks: Britain and Italy Moving Towards Common Goal; Scale of Disarmament May Be Lowered to Achieve Success; Germany Still Insists on Principle of Equality in Armaments <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(London) Recent events have made a disarmament treaty with an outline of British proposals all the more necessary. This was the conclusion of the talks in London between Italian representative Suvich, British Foreign Secretary Simon, and Eden. The Italian government believes that if the entire British plan cannot be accepted by others, it may be better to lower the scale and make a smaller disarmament in order to achieve success. The British side believes that the British plan has reduced difficulties compared to the original disarmament proposals because: (1) Some countries with a genuine spirit of self-restraint have reduced their armaments to a lower standard than they can permanently agree to, such as the British Air Force and the French Army; (2) If the purpose is to limit armaments according to the current level, it is still doubtful whether some countries will allow people to investigate their armaments and numbers; (3) A static agreement will necessarily involve restrictions on the number of various armaments, and it will be difficult to implement supervised management of this aspect. It is expected that when the current talks end tomorrow, there will be tangible progress towards a common goal.</p>

This treaty, based on equality, could give Europe peace and restore the necessary sense of security and trust for the recovery of European economic life. The right to self-defense and equality cannot be denied to Germany. No one can deny the moderation of Germany's demands for national defense tools. Hitler's appropriate armaments demands have shown an unshakable determination to defend the country and mark the beginning of a new era of genuine peace in Europe. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Bardoux Leaves Warsaw for Czechoslovakia, Relations Between Poland and Czechia Expected to Improve. Krakow, Poland. French Foreign Minister Bardoux and Polish Foreign Minister Beck arrived here last night at 11:50 pm, planning to leave for Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, tomorrow. (25th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Warsaw. French Foreign Minister Bardoux has completed his official visit to Poland. The government issued a communiqué reporting the results of Bardoux's trip, stating that the first thing to declare is that the 1921 French-Polish alliance treaty remains the basis of relations between the two countries. Regarding the disarmament issue, Bardoux explained France's views in detail, which seem to be in line with Poland's views. In addition, Poland intends to maintain a good-neighborly policy with its neighbors and intends to negotiate with Soviet Russia to extend the effective period of the mutual non-aggression treaty between the two countries (Soviet Russia and Poland are in negotiations, see our telegram of April 21). As for the Czech arrest and subsequent release of Polish people, it is hoped that it can be resolved peacefully. French Foreign Minister Bardoux also discussed economic issues and prepared to hold negotiations in Warsaw to establish a temporary solution. (24th Havas Agency Telegram) (Paris) Local newspapers believe that French Foreign Minister Bardoux's talks with Polish General Pilsudski in Warsaw are the most important event of Bardoux's trip. The Daily News reported that Pilsudski had repeatedly stated that the French-Polish agreement was unchangeable and told Bardoux that Poland would continue to support the League of Nations as the only mechanism for resolving international problems. According to reports, Pilsudski's friendship with Soviet Russia is limited to the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty and will not form a closer relationship. Furthermore, he did not mention the dispute between Poland and Czechia, which France values, which is strange. Regarding the German-Polish treaty, he discussed it in detail, but stated that there are no secret agreements between Germany and Poland. Regarding Germany's restoration of armaments, he reportedly held an extremely positive observation point and sarcastically suggested to Bardoux that France would eventually be oppressed and should improve its current attitude towards Germany. Furthermore, because Polish Foreign Minister Beck will accompany Bardoux to Krakow today, it is believed that Bardoux's trip to Warsaw seems to be a victory on the surface.

<p>London Gold: The London gold price today was 135 shillings and 6.5 pence, a decrease of 4.5 pence compared to yesterday's price.</p>
<p>London Silver: The London silver market was weak today, with spot prices at 18 pence 75 and futures at 18 pence 875, both down 5625. This was mainly due to selling by the United States and China, as well as weak buying interest. The New York silver market opened weakly today due to unfavorable foreign news and the liquidation of long positions. The opening drop was quite sharp, about 1.5 US cents lower than London, which triggered buying. About half of these transactions came from London. The market gradually stabilized before noon, and prices recovered slightly because the liquidations after the opening had been absorbed. However, according to Washington news, the silver faction seems to be failing, so the market is not very calm. Therefore, the opening price of the forward silver market here today was reduced by 55 to 100 pounds compared to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Bombay Silver: The Bombay silver market was weak at 5:30 PM today. The spot price was 52 rupees and 8 annas, down 1 rupee and 5 annas. Futures both fell, one by 1 rupee and 4 annas, and the other by 1 rupee and 5 annas.</p>

<p>British-American: In the London foreign exchange market this morning, European operators repurchased US dollars, causing the British-American exchange rate to open down 125 to 5 dollars and 1 dime and 5 cents. Before noon, prices gradually trended down to 5 dollars, 1 dime, 4 cents, and 4375, a decrease of 5625 compared to the opening. Also, one US dollar equals 3 shillings and 10 pence and 5629 British gold.</p>
<p>British-French: The opening was 77 francs 37, the same as yesterday's closing price. Later, there were mixed ups and downs. At 3 PM, the price was 77 francs 53. US-British: The New York exchange rate for British pounds opened at 5.14.125 today, a sudden drop of 1 cent compared to the previous day. The second round recovered slightly, changing to 5.14.625. The third, fourth, and fifth rounds also fell slightly to 5.14.25. The sixth round was the lowest at 5.14.00.</p>
<p>US-French: The New York exchange rate for French francs opened at 6.64.00 today, a decrease of .2.</p>

<p>American Cotton: When the cotton market opened today, prices rose due to improvements in the actual position, large-scale purchases by peers, the capture of short positions, and reactive purchases, as well as purchases by European and Japanese merchants. The liquidation of long positions and selling from the local South and New Orleans were all absorbed. After the opening, news from Liverpool turned positive, and peers bought in droves, but foreign merchants sold due to the spread of May futures settlements and the weakness of the US dollar, which slightly offset the rise. The New York market issued 20,200 bales of May delivery notices, while New Orleans issued 33,100 bales.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market opened weaker this morning. At 1 PM, the price for July futures was 5.79, down 6 pounds.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market price for July futures was 4 shillings and 3 pence 875, down 375 from yesterday's close.</p>

<p>London: Rubber was slightly weaker in London today. At noon, the transaction price for July and September futures was 6 pence 0625, down one thirty-second.</p>
<p>New York: Although the rubber market was active in New York, prices were weak. Due to the lack of news restricting production, speculators liquidated their long positions.</p>

<p>In New York today, security opening prices showed narrow and mixed fluctuations. The prices of major items were all weak, but the stock market was still able to maintain, which can be seen as encouraging. However, the speculative psychology in the market has cooled down, and it is expected that there will be a trend of minor and unimportant transactions in the short term. If the market stalls thereafter, prices will also weaken. Merchants are now waiting for developments and are unwilling to make new transactions immediately. The report of He Sheng Yangxing on the market prices of fifteen types of New York securities (ending at 1:45 AM) is listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Japanese Troops Encircle the Anti-Japanese Volunteers in Hulin丨Chen Dongshan and Gao Yushan Defend丨丨 <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>A correspondent in Harbin reports that the Anti-Japanese Volunteers in eastern Jilin Province were active near Suifenhe last month, occupying Hulin and besieging Mishan. The units of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers led by Chen Dongshan and Gao Yushan are echoing the units of Wang Delin and Kong Xianwu in the Tokyo Cheng area, forming a connection. The Hirose unit of the 10th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Harbin attacked with a large force. At that time, the Chen and Gao units were being pursued by the Japanese troops in Fujin from the rear, facing enemies on both sides for a time. They retreated to Guliyulin in Hulin, where they defended the dangerous terrain and gradually replenished their forces, waiting for another opportunity. The 10th Division of the Japanese Army still sent the Kaneko branch of the Takamori unit stationed at Maqiaohe along Mishan Hulin, to attack in coordination with the 4th Cavalry Brigade of the puppet Jilin Army, led by Guo Baoshan. The Fujimoto detachment of the Osedo unit of the Japanese Army stationed in Yanshou connected with the 7th Brigade of the puppet Jilin Army, led by Bai Wenqing, and went straight to Hulin. The Yoshizawa detachment of the Japanese Army stationed in Duojin went to Baoqing, attacking the flank of Hulin. After the fierce battle last month, the Chen and Gao units of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers suffered heavy casualties and were short of ammunition. Because the city defenses of Hulin offered no protection, they joined more than a thousand Anti-Japanese Volunteers of Wang Sanhao in Raohe at Guliyulin, using each other as a stronghold. The Japanese army's attack plan seems to be to encircle them on three sides. If the mountains are difficult to break through, they also plan to besiege the Anti-Japanese Volunteers for a long time. Therefore, all roads leading out of Guliyulin have been fortified with blockhouses by the Japanese army, which are equipped with machine guns to monitor the Anti-Japanese Volunteers. Each blockhouse is stationed with 100 to 150 Japanese soldiers. The original name of the valley was Dumugou. The area is about 80 li from east to west and about 160 li from north to south.</p>
<p>The main products are opium, timber, and fur. It is a large forest area. The logged forests and empty land are scattered with more than a thousand households. The roads leading out of the valley include the four main roads of Mishan, Tuanshanzi, Baoqing, and Hulin. Among them, the road between Mishan and Hulin is relatively flat, and cars can be driven in winter. Today, all four main roads have been blocked by the Japanese army. The grain stored in Guliyulin can be eaten for six months. Currently, Gao Yushan and Chen Yushan have sent troops to occupy the traffic crossings based on the natural barriers, digging trenches for long-term defense. On the one hand, they led the troops to implement a per capita land allocation system, separately reclaiming land as a self-sufficiency measure. Therefore, it currently forms a standoff with the Japanese army. This unit of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers is the most organized and strongest among the various units in Jilin and Heilongjiang, so the Japanese and puppet troops are eager to eliminate it. Chen and Gao are also afraid of being besieged for a long time and running out of food, so they sent representatives to Suifenhe, Yimianpo, Muling, Ning'an, Dongning, Dunhua and other places to contact various branches of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers, intending to use the strategy of "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao" to lift the siege of Guliyulin. Recently, Genshan, Jinshan, Qingshan, and Daqingshan in the mountains of Yimianpo and other places, and famous mountains in the Weihuling area, Delin, Chaoyang, Xishuangsheng and other branches of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers are several thousand strong, and are active around Hengdaohezi, aiming to capture Suifenhe to force the Japanese army to rescue. Therefore, in the past week, the Dongtie Hasui Line has become tense again, which is caused by the activities of the Anti-Japanese Volunteers. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Bandit Liu Completely Annihilated, All Armies are Searching for Remnants <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondent reports that when Liu Guitang's remaining bandits were fleeing westward at Henggou at 3:00 AM on the 23rd, they were intercepted by Kang Zhankui's regiment, killing dozens. They then broke up into smaller groups and fled separately. A larger group desperately fled along the border between Rizhao and Juxian. Finally, they fled west along the Xun River from Liangshankou in Rizhao and were intercepted by various armies, putting them in a very embarrassing situation. They passed Zhuzhou Nanling, entered Juxian County, passed Tianzhuang, Mazhuang, Yaobu, Heijian, and fled into the mountains, hiding in the wheat fields around Xianglushan Langwoshan Maqiyao. The bandits also changed into white trousers and jackets and, because they had been fleeing day and night in Shandong for a month, had no time to shave. On the evening of the 23rd, they busily shaved their hair with knives, preparing to hide with guns. On the morning of the 24th, two central airplanes flew in the direction of reconnaissance, but because the bandits were scattered and hiding, they were not discovered. Later, the bandits traveled south from the disordered mountains, passing Shanghu, Jishan Xipi, and Tangzhuang. At about 10:00 AM, they arrived near Tubaiyanggou and Xiabaiyanggou and were detected by the bandit suppression army. Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division, led a battalion of infantry and a company of cavalry to attack Baiyanggou from Liugou to the northwest. Liu's battalion of the 22nd Division also advanced from Dadian via Laozi Lve to the southeast. The bandits suddenly encountered Zhan's unit and, not daring to resist, fled in a panic to Dongjiantou. At that time, Liu's battalion also arrived to intercept and suppress them. The bandits turned back south and passed Shangxiabaiyanggou to Sanguanmiao Wanghailou. Zhan and Liu's units immediately surrounded and attacked them from both sides. The bandits could not break through despite fighting to the death. By 4:00 PM, the situation was completely resolved. In this battle, more than 60 rifles, 4 pistols, more than 60 bandits were killed, and more than 30 were captured. More than 70 good horses were obtained. No one escaped. Liu's battalion returned to Juxian, and Zhan Shutang is searching for the remaining bandits in Sanguanmiao near Shangxiabaiyanggou. Another small group, about twenty people, fled into Rizhao on the 23rd, from Hujiazhuang to the north of Sanzhuang. The Rizhao People's League immediately surrounded them. The bandits did not resist and claimed to be willing to surrender their guns. The district chief asked County Chief Yang Jinbiao for instructions. On the afternoon of the 24th, they completed the surrender of their weapons. One battalion of Gao Lantian's unit is now stationed in San Zhuang for suppression. Liu's bandits had been raiding Shandong for nearly 40 days, and now they have been completely resolved, removing a major threat from North China. Now the bandit suppression armies are following Han Fuju's orders, searching for the remaining bandits and returning to defense. Ma Guanyi's brigade will soon arrive in Zaozhuang, board trains and return to Dezhou. Gao Lantian's regiment will also go to Gaomi and return to its original defense in Haiyang. Kang Zhankui's regiment arrived in Qingzhou on the 24th, boarded trains and came west. Tang Bangzhi's brigade will return to Jinan. Also, when the bandits passed Rizhao, the Lian Zhuang Hui captured two or thirty scattered bandits. When the bandits fled in Shichang, Ma Guanyi's brigade also captured more than a dozen people in the north. According to reports, the 22nd Division seized a large amount of military equipment from the bandits this time, including six light machine guns and more than two hundred rifles. Other parts have not yet been counted and reported. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Lu Han Dispels Resignation Intentions, Jiang Bocheng Arrives in Jinan to Console and Retain <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondent reports that Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju had asked to resign because Liu's bandits had been raiding Shandong for more than a month before the bandits were mostly suppressed. However, the past command and arrangements were very troublesome, so he was physically unwell. Furthermore, because Liu's bandits were such a small group and could not be immediately eliminated in Shandong for more than a month, he felt that he had not fulfilled his military duties. Therefore, he recently telegraphed National Government Chairman Lin Sen, Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei, and Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting to resign from all his positions so that he could recuperate. After the telegrams were sent, the central government believed that North China was in a time of crisis and relied heavily on him. How could it allow him to withdraw? Lin, Wang, and Chiang all sent telegrams of consolation and encouragement. Chiang even telegraphed Han again, saying that at this time of national crisis, the security of North China is of great importance to the overall situation, urging him to do his best and eliminate the intention to resign. He also ordered Chiang Po-cheng to come to Jinan from Peiping to personally convey his condolences and retain him. Chiang Po-cheng arrived in Jinan from Peiping on the morning of the 22nd and personally spoke with Han about everything. After being persuaded by various parties, Han replied to Chairman Chiang this evening, saying that he would comply and cancel his resignation, and would temporarily be responsible for Shandong's military and political affairs as usual, and would strive to serve the public despite his illness.</p>
<p>Also, news reports that Shen Honglie, Ge Guangting, Jiang Bocheng and others came to Jinan some days ago to persuade and retain Han Fuju, who had resigned from the central government. Han has now dispelled his intention to resign after being persuaded by various parties, and has been meeting and talking with Jiang, Shen and Ge for days. Today (24th) at 10:00 AM, Han, accompanied by Jiang, Shen and Ge, took a car to Luokou to visit the Yellow River and had lunch together in Luokou. Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Education Director He Siyuan, Construction Director Zhang Honglie, Provincial Government Committee Member Zhang Cheng and others also went along. They returned to Jinan at 2:00 PM. Jiang Bocheng, with Han having dispelled his intention to resign and his mission completed, was originally scheduled to leave Jinan and return to Peiping tonight (24th). Ge Guangting and Shen Honglie also planned to return to Qingdao, but were retained by Han and changed their plans to leave Jinan separately tomorrow morning (25th). The following is a record of Jiang Bocheng's conversation: [Chairman Han's reason for resigning this time was actually because of his eagerness to seek improvement</p>
<p>and to govern well. Chairman Chiang saw Chairman Han as the pillar of North China and relied heavily on him, so he telegraphed to earnestly retain him. After I arrived in Jinan, I worked with Mayor Shen (Honglie), Chairman Ge (Guangting) and local gentry and merchants to do our best to retain him. Chairman Han has dispelled his intention to resign and will continue to be responsible for Shandong's military and political affairs. Regarding the Shandong party affairs disputes, Chairman Chen (Lifu) originally planned to come to Shandong for a trip to convene various committee members to talk and explain everything, but because of his busy public affairs, he will not come north for the time being. After I came to Jinan, I invited Chairman Zhang (村) and Chairman Li (Wenzhai) and others to talk. The misunderstandings between the two sides have been resolved, and the party affairs work will continue as usual, without any problems. As for the Jinan Arsenal, Chairman Han believes that it is expensive and difficult to operate, and plans to ask the Central Government to take it over. After I met with Chairman Han and discussed it, it was decided to ask the Central Government to take over, and I have telegraphed Chairman Chiang to report this situation, asking him to instruct the Ministry of Military Administration to send personnel to take over. I have completed my public affairs in Jinan, so I will return to Peiping immediately.] etc. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Public Appeal by Songjiang Citizens Regarding River Dredging <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Tang Gengyang and other citizens of Songjiang collectively sent a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, the Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman, the Director of Finance Chen, and the Director of Construction Shen, regarding river dredging. The telegram stated: All previous river dredging projects in Songjiang were planned and carried out based on the convenience of weather, geography, and manpower, always achieving results with minimal cost. Now, the County Magistrate Jin Tigan and the technical director Xu Mo Jia, for the sake of dredging the city river, are colluding with local powerful merchants and cleverly imposing harsh taxes. During the busy farming season of the plum rains, they recklessly recruit hundreds of strong out-of-town laborers, squandering more than three times the provincial funds and people's wealth, causing great harm to the local area. We respectfully present this to your esteemed office: (1) After the Qingming Festival, farming activities are in full swing. At this time, to cut off the dam and the water source deprives the rice paddies of irrigation. This is the first thing that hinders agricultural work. (2) In the late spring climate, there is continuous overcast and rain. Dredging the river by pumping water causes it to overflow as quickly as it's pumped. Squandering funds and wasting time will only lead to clumsiness. This is the second thing that violates the seasons. (3) The dredging cost of our Songjiang city river has never exceeded 20,000 yuan. Taking the two instances of the 6th and 14th years of the Republic as examples, the cost of earth excavation, regardless of difficult labor and transportation, averaged only 55 cents. The total dredging cost was less than 20,000 yuan. The established case can be reviewed. However, this time, there is intentional delay, and recruitment and bidding are only conducted when the farming season is approaching. As a result, the Taichang Gravel Company, which has no river dredging experience, rises to take the contract. Consequently, the price of 20,000 yuan in previous years suddenly jumps to a huge sum of 63,000 yuan. (According to the county government's announcement, in addition to the construction fee of 28,000 yuan approved by the provincial departments, the designated local donation portion requires 35,000 yuan.) This is the third thing that falsely squanders provincial and local funds. (4) The labor cost per cubic foot in Songjiang has suddenly increased, nominally at 40 cents, but in reality, difficult labor and long-distance transportation are secretly added, making it as high as 1.84 yuan per cubic foot. In reality, there is no so-called difficult or long-distance transportation in dredging the city river. This is how they deceive superiors, defraud the public, and cleverly embezzle funds. This is the fourth thing that is unacceptable. (5) Songjiang is located in a vital area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, often infested with bandits. Now, in a place where farming is flourishing, all industries are withering, and vagrants are abundant, suddenly recruiting thousands of strong out-of-town laborers and gathering them in an important city will inevitably disrupt the local area. Recently, the initial dredging in Huayang Town, east of the city, has already caused neighboring residents to suffer from the indiscriminate dumping of river mud, leading to frequent disputes. With such disturbances at the beginning, the future is long and the risks are even more worrying. This is the fifth thing that is unacceptable. (6) Songjiang is a water town, and waterway transportation is crucial to the prosperity of commerce. In recent years, Songjiang's commerce has declined, and the city is in recession, far less prosperous than Qingpu's Zhujiajiao town. The reason is that the rivers are not smooth, causing congestion. River dredging should be a priority, but it is not done from the source, and only the surface mud is dug in the center of the city river, which is practically the same as not dredging at all. This is the sixth thing that is unacceptable. (7) There should be a budget for river dredging, but the budget has never been published. There should be a scheduled date for the contractor to be paid, but the payment date has not been announced. Not only is the public completely unaware of this important matter, but even the standing committee members of the river dredging project are in a fog, unable to inquire. This is the seventh thing that is unacceptable. (8) At the beginning of the preparations, the county government proposed that all river dredging staff should be paid salaries. The upright gentlemen of Songjiang, unwilling to fill their own pockets with the people's hard-earned money, requested the cancellation. However, the county government's existing public officials who are assigned to river dredging duties all hold concurrent positions and receive concurrent salaries. The people pay taxes to support these public officials with regular monthly salaries, and when their duties arise and are related to construction, these natural committee members want to obtain this undeserved benefit. This is the eighth thing that is unacceptable. In addition to these eight unacceptable things, there is also the matter of soliciting donations, which goes against public opinion. Ordinary people are distinguished as gentry and wealthy, and certain types of businesses are selected and tasked with paying special donations. Songyi is located in the interior, and most people live by digging wells and farming, content with their daily lives, so there are no wealthy merchants to speak of, and even fewer wealthy gentry to behold. Imposing donations here is already the height of exploitation. Furthermore, there is a rental housing donation, where each household must donate two months' rent, half from the landlord and half from the tenant, assuming that those who rent houses from others must have surplus funds, and those who live under someone else's roof can spare one month. Who knows that families of eight have no other income and rely on this for their livelihoods? Donating these two months' rent would starve their eight mouths, and those who live under someone else's roof suffer even more. Moreover, during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, there was a proposal to collect two months' rent, entrusting the police chief to supervise with inspectors and hiring employees from the Chamber of Commerce to collect donations from house to house. The people of Songjiang scraped together what they could to provide it. To this day, there has not been a single report of the expenses, shown to the public. All of the above are facts, and violating the three major principles of weather, geography, and manpower is especially unreasonable. We have no choice but to request your esteemed office to swiftly order the cessation of forced donations, and to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth of the construction funds, to punish corruption and bring peace to the good people. The people of Songjiang would be fortunate, and the local area would be fortunate. Citizens of Songjiang County, Tang Zhigao, Sun Huzhan, Lu Guiliang, Wu Cunfu, Xia Xiasan, Song Yunsheng, Wang Zhongwei, and Liang Ruoyuan, respectfully kowtow.</p>

<p>The Provincial Government ordered the county to thoroughly investigate the incident in Tinglin Township, Punan, where villagers destroyed the Public Security Bureau during a lantern festival. The county police authorities have strictly arrested and interrogated the villagers involved. Details have been reported in the Shanghai and Songjiang newspapers. It is now learned that Xu Weisheng and others, natives of Songjiang residing in Beijing, after seeing reports on the cause of the incident, which included the tearing of the national flag and the burning of the Premier's portrait by members of the Public Security Bureau, believe that there is a need to present the case to the province for thorough investigation. They have specifically attached newspapers and telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate and deal with the matter. The county government has now received a directive from the provincial government ordering a thorough investigation and response.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Recent Developments in Land Survey and Measurement <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Our county previously received an order from the province to carry out land survey and measurement. During the tenure of former County Magistrate Shen, funds were raised for the land survey and measurement, and a Land Survey and Measurement Fund Management Committee was established, with funds deposited in the Farmers Bank. Personnel were also dispatched to make preparations. The Provincial Land Bureau also sent personnel to Songjiang last year to measure the central point and establish a marker in the eastern city, which was carried out quite intensively. Measurement has already begun in the Xijiaoziyu area of the fifth Ku of the tenth district at the beginning of this month. At the same time, the measured fields are being drawn into maps. The aforementioned work team members were sent by the Provincial Land Bureau, with He Xuzu, leader of the first group of the Provincial Land Survey and Measurement team, leading the team to Songjiang. An office was set up in Qiujiawan, and 50 surveyors were recruited to serve. After the measurement of the tenth district is completed, the first district will be measured in sequence. It is now learned that the Provincial Land Bureau has sent five employees, including Yan Zheng, to Songjiang yesterday to carry out measurements at the marker site in the East Gate. Group leader He has sent a letter to the chief of the first district to request assistance. After the land survey and measurement in our county is completed in the future, registration will be carried out, which requires personnel with considerable knowledge to serve. Therefore, County Magistrate Jin has selected Hu Runlin and Shen Shuyong to go to the province for training, and they have already set off.</p>

<p>In order to promote the development of social undertakings in various counties, the Provincial Party Headquarters has divided all counties in the province into several districts, sending commissioners to provide guidance, stationed in the central county to set up offices. Our county and neighboring counties are listed as the second district, with our county as the central county. Niu Changyao, a member of the Provincial Party Committee, serves as the guidance commissioner, and the office is organized within the First District Party Headquarters in the city. Work has begun today. County Magistrate Jin and the county executive committee visited him together. It is heard that Commissioner Niu will actively promote cooperative undertakings in our county to benefit the rural areas.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department intends to take over the county's city and township long-distance telephone services in order to unify telephone management. The County Chamber of Commerce specifically submitted a petition to the Provincial Government yesterday (24th), stating that the telephones in all townships of the county were constructed with donations from the local people, costing 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. They are purely part of the county's public property and are also a type of county-run enterprise. If the takeover is approved, not only will local construction lack guarantees, but who would be willing to try to run public enterprises? Please instruct the Construction Department to exempt the takeover. Even if it concerns unified telephone administration and the request is not adopted, it is requested that a fair valuation be made and the compensation be paid to value the county's assets and respect public opinion.</p>

<p>The County Construction Bureau technicians have completed the measurement of the road surface of the Huanhu Road on the Five-Li Lake in the western township of our county. The entire line is 11 kilometers and 89 meters long, and it has been determined that a Changqiao Bridge should be built at Baojiekou, with the foundation at Baojieqinshan, passing near Huiquanshan. The head of the third district, Yu Xunzhen, and the bridge construction director, Rong Desheng, have negotiated and agreed. Because this matter is significant and the construction period is very long, it has been presented to the county government for approval and a notice has been issued to inform the people on both sides of the river to cooperate in order to facilitate the progress. Subsequently, Rong Desheng ordered the construction of more than 20 factory buildings at the base of the bridge on both the east and west sides, and contracted the project to Gu. Cement, steel, yellow sand, and foreign pine and other application materials were transported to the site, and central wooden piles were nailed in the center of the river as a standard for work. After breaking ground at the end of last month, construction has commenced. First, wooden piles are nailed and erected at the bridge abutments on both ends, and foreign pine planks are laid on top as the initial work for making cement piles. There are dozens of workers actively working, and there are two ferries traveling back and forth between the two ends. The bridge project is very large, with an estimated 60 loops and a grand scale, requiring more than 100,000 yuan, which can be called the largest project in the county.</p>

<p>The notorious bandit Gu Yuliang of Wu County, using the alias Jiang Helin, previously lived in Gujia Village in the third district. He was fierce and engaged in robbery, murder, arson, and all kinds of evil. He was able to fire a box gun with both hands. For example, he robbed the house of Wang Songyun, the township assistant of Qianlou Luan Township, and set fire to dozens of houses, robbed boats at the wharf, and killed and wounded many people. Some of his accomplices were arrested and executed, but Gu Yuliang pretended to die of illness and went into hiding in Shanghai. Every winter, he would return to his hometown with accomplices to rob. Recently, in February, he privately carried a box gun and a rifle in the vicinity of Baima Temple in Jintan County to rob. The rifle failed to fire continuously and was surrounded and captured by the public, and sent to the county for sentencing to fifteen years' imprisonment. When County Magistrate Cai of our county heard the news, he first sent a letter to the county government to inquire, and then received a reply stating that he had committed many crimes in Changzhou and was allowed to be extradited. Yesterday (24th), he prepared a document and sent police to Jintan to escort the bandit Gu Yuliang to Changzhou for interrogation.</p>

<p>After the Sheng Kang Qianzhuang on Cuiya Street in this city was robbed at 2:00 pm on the 31st of last month, Zhao Shunfa, the head of the detective team of the Security Division, immediately purchased a wide range of informants and cooperated in the investigation. It was later found that the case was committed by Yu Aliang, who lives in a certain village west of Yinjiang Bridge in Yinxi. Yu is a well-known bandit with many accomplices, who has been kidnapping and robbing in Shanghai. In March of this year, he committed a crime in Shanghai. Due to the urgent pursuit by the police, it was difficult to settle down. He and two gangs of bandits came to Ningbo with weapons to rob the Sheng Kang Qianzhuang. After obtaining the loot, they fled to their hometown to hide. On the 2nd of this month, they went to Shanghai, and on the 21st, they took the Hongxing wheel to Ningbo again. Captain Zhao received a telegram from Shanghai and waited at the port in advance. As soon as the wheel arrived at the port, he arrested the bandit Yu, took him back to the team for interrogation.</p>

<p>Philippine Senate Speaker Quezon, accompanied by his wife and several Philippine senators, went to the United States to discuss the issue of independence. Now that they have achieved success, they arrived in Shanghai on the Empress of Canada. The Pan-Pacific Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mayor Wu all held banquets to entertain them one after another. They are scheduled to return to the Philippines by the original vessel this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Special Ship to Greet <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The ship entered port at around 8 o'clock yesterday morning and docked at the Qichangzhan wharf in Pudong at 9:45. The welcoming personnel included Tang Shixuan, representative of Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Zhao Tiezhang, section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, and personnel from the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai. A Jinghui small vessel of the Jianghai Customs was specially prepared to greet them in advance. After Mr. Quezon exchanged greetings with each of the welcoming personnel on the ship, he transferred to the special ship at 9:30 and sailed back to the Xinguang wharf, where he went ashore and went to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Accompanying Personnel <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Those who came with Mr. Quezon, in addition to his wife and one son and two daughters, included Senator Quireno and his wife and daughter, Ernan and his wife and daughter, Capelton, Nieto, and Las and his wife and daughter, Mrs. Maria Picameiro, Mrs. Dulores Picameiro, Ms. Homolo, Mrs. Lama, Mrs. Achangyu, Mr. Losen Shore, Dr. Cabenuno, Mr. Jasu, Mr. Keyuan, Mr. Quireno, Mr. Pield, Ms. Carmen, Mr. Gaxia, and Mr. Anke, a total of more than 30 people.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Chamber of Commerce Reception <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a tea party in the conference room on the third floor of the chamber at 5:00 pm yesterday because Mr. Quezon had negotiated several times for the Philippine independence movement and has now achieved satisfactory results. The Philippines is a region where overseas Chinese gather, and overseas Chinese merchants occupy a dominant position. In the future, after the Philippines becomes independent, trade between China and the Philippines will inevitably flourish. In addition to Quezon and his wife and the entire delegation, those present included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of Public Utilities Xu Peihuang, Municipal Government Secretary Tang Shixuan, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Committee Members Wang Yansong, Pei Yunqing, Chen Zheqing, Yu Zuoting, Wen Lanting, and chairmen of various trade associations, Chen Liting and his wife, Liu Wang Liming, and others, totaling more than 80 people. Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting and Xie Fusheng served as the translator.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcome speech, saying, "On October 12, 1929, ten groups gathered here to welcome you. At that time, there was a saying: 'Mr. Quezon is a leader who seeks happiness for the Philippines, with great aspirations and diligent achievements.' All of us present here deeply admire him.</p>
<p>We hope to continue to work hard year after year and achieve a Chinese idiom, which is 'Where there is a will, there is a way.' We said this sentence exactly four and a half years ago. Mr. Quezon has surprisingly returned to his hometown with his successful mission to report to his compatriots. This is such a fortunate thing. We believe that the Philippines' position is the vanguard of peace in the Pacific, and the success of the Philippines in the political aspect is of great significance to the future of the Pacific. Therefore, our small tribute today can also be called a celebration banquet for Mr. Quezon. The communication between the Chinese and Filipino peoples is earlier than the communication with Europeans and can be called old friends. The communication has been long, and for hundreds of years, the two peoples have had a history of intermarriage, so they can also be called close neighbors with kinship. Because we have these two qualifications, our country is willing to cite a Chinese idiom, which is 'Nothing is too good to talk about.' Today, we will contribute this meaning to Mr. Quezon. The Filipino people are the most capable of absorbing new ideas, without being rigid or stubborn, and are the fastest progressing people. We know that the reform of the Philippines' internal affairs, the popularization of education, and the development of the economy have only been in history for four or fifty years, but in terms of its achievements, it can be at least equivalent to the progress of a century. Therefore, based on the past history, we can make predictions for the future. We believe that the next ten years will be a time for the Filipino people to struggle harder. We believe that the result of the Filipino people's efforts can build an Eastern Switzerland and an Eastern Belgium in the Pacific. This is a prediction we dare to make. As old friends, and as close neighbors with kinship, we plan to organize a commercial delegation to visit your country in the autumn and winter to observe the progress of various facilities recently, so as to learn from our country and seek the development of commerce between us, so that the connection between the two peoples will become closer and closer. I hope Mr. Quezon will be willing to convey this idea in advance. With the return trip imminent, I would like to raise a glass to celebrate Mr. Quezon and the success of the Filipino people's efforts, and wish them unlimited progress in the future."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Quezon's Reply <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Quezon replied, "The Philippine Independence Movement delegation, on its way back from the United States, when passing through Shanghai, is grateful for this grand celebration meeting held by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and commercial groups. I respectfully express my gratitude on behalf of the entire delegation. Recalling four years ago, when I passed through Shanghai for the Philippine independence movement, the Chamber of Commerce and others welcomed me, and at that time, there was a saying that 'the Philippine independence will eventually be successful.' At that time, it was still a kind of hope and prediction, but now it has become a reality. The result of this trip to the United States is that from next year, the entire island will be completely autonomous, and all officials will be appointed by Filipinos, but the American flag will still be hung. After ten years, the American flag can be removed and become a new country in the Pacific recognized by the world. The people of our country are very happy with the success of this trip by the delegation. The ideal of the past has now become a brilliant reality. I am one of the most enthusiastic about the independence movement. In my childhood, I had the idea of the independence of the Philippines in my mind, and since I grew up, I have taken the independence of the Philippines as my only mission. Today, I am deeply ashamed that the Chairman gave a speech to celebrate the success and development of the independence of the Philippines. At the same time, I sincerely accept this kindness. The relationship between China and the Philippines has a long history. The Philippines has been in communication with China since the beginning of its founding. I hope that friendship will increase and commerce will prosper in the future. The blood relationship between the people of the two countries is especially valuable. Almost all famous people in the Philippines have Chinese blood, and the large number of overseas Chinese in the Philippines, their high moral character, and their purity and credibility are especially welcomed by Filipinos. The chairman said that there will be a commercial investigation team to the Philippines this autumn, which is deeply welcomed. If you say sightseeing, I dare not accept it. If you want to seek mutual understanding and practical cooperation between the two countries, you must have frequent contact. A year ago, a semi-official investigation team from the Philippines came to China and was well received. The Chinese delegation will be greatly welcomed this autumn. I also have a request to the chairman: I hope to pull Mayor Wu to go together, which will be even more welcome. The enthusiasm of the Philippines in welcoming the Chinese delegation must far exceed that of any other visiting groups or representatives, and I hope that this will be the first time for the Chinese investigation team to go to the Philippines, and there will be countless trips back and forth, so that the commercial and national feelings of the two countries will increase day by day. Because the interests of the two countries are related, China's progress is the Philippines' progress, and the Philippines' progress is China's progress. I am honored that the chairman celebrated and praised the future of our delegation. I respectfully transfer it to China. China is gradually progressing today. Because of its vast land and abundant resources, and its excellent people, it will surely be the leader of the world in the future."</p>

<p>Mr. Lan is currently about fifty-six or fifty-seven years old. He is a graduate of the University of Melbourne in Australia.

This time, he has come to investigate the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and other places. According to Mr. Lan's interview with reporters, his first visit to the Dutch East Indies was because that location is closest to Australia, so he went there first. In the future, the Australian side may add commercial commissioners in important commercial ports in the Far East, but this is not an urgent need. Mr. Moore, an intelligence officer who came with me this time, is preparing to handle the liaison work needed for commerce, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e125">More than a Thousand Representatives of the Zhabei District Rent Reduction Association Petition <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Student representatives explained their plight, and Section Chief Hong promised to forward it. The Zhabei District General Association of the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, based on the resolution of the representatives' conference the day before yesterday, gathered at its Baoshan Road clubhouse at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 1,000 representatives from various branch associations arrived, each holding a white flag with slogans such as "[Reduce Rent to Revitalize the Zhabei Market]", "[Rent Reduction as the Vanguard for the Prosperity of the Zhabei Market]", "[Request the Mayor to Consider the Citizens Surviving After the War]", and "[Demand the Mayor to Quickly Reduce Rent]". Under the command of Ma Rugen, Jiang Yanqing, Feng Qibiao, and others, they boarded more than 30 freight trucks and proceeded in an orderly manner towards the municipal government. The citizens on Baoshan Road and Jiangwan Road applauded and cheered on both sides, almost emptying the streets. Unexpectedly, while passing the West Road of the Sports Association, the Public Security Bureau of the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District received an order from the municipal government to stop their progress. Therefore, the bureau specially dispatched all armed police to stop them. After repeated negotiations by the responsible personnel of the association, the bureau chief requested instructions from the municipal government. The municipal government agreed to send representatives to the bureau to meet face-to-face. A temporary citizens' representatives' conference was immediately held on that road, and Sun Junman, Xu Zaikang, Wei Zhiqiu, Lü Chunsan, Zhang Jimao, and five other representatives were publicly elected to go to the municipal government with a small number of people to request the mayor to alleviate the suffering of the citizens of Zhabei after the disaster and to provide relief for the current situation. Because the mayor had other important business that day, Section Chief Hong of the Second Department was specially appointed to receive them on his behalf. The representatives of the association presented the suffering of the people in Zhabei who had been affected by the disaster, as well as the various oppressions they suffered from landlords, coupled with the decline of commerce and the sluggish market, and all the phenomena. They even asked Section Chief Hong to forward the suffering of the citizens of Zhabei to the mayor. Section Chief Hong was responsible for replying, promising to fully convey it to the mayor. At the same time, Section Chief Hong stated that he would make all the facilities in Zhabei after the war benefit all the citizens of Zhabei. The representatives of the association were satisfied, bid farewell, and led the representatives of the entire district back to the Baoshan Road clubhouse, reported the situation of the petition to the municipal government to the branch associations. All the representatives were satisfied and decided to hold another representatives' conference of various branch associations the next day.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The United States Establishes a Lieutenant General Resident in Shanghai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Lieutenant General White Radman of the U.S. Army, who arrived in Shanghai from the United States on Sunday night, took office yesterday. Mr. White is appointed as the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai. Colonel Bi Mang, the original commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment, will continue to serve as usual. The stationing of a lieutenant general in Shanghai is the beginning of a new system and is similar to the British system of stationing troops in Shanghai, where in addition to the commander of the army, there is also a lieutenant general as commander.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Federation of Industrial Associations Petitions the Ministry of Industries to Define the Enforcement Methods of the Production Conference: Matters Belonging to the Government to be Executed by the Government; Matters Belonging to Production to be Executed by the Industry Itself <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the National Production Conference, after receiving the order from the Ministry of Industries to appoint Guo Shun, Qian Chengxu, Cai Shengbai, and others as the conveners of the city to organize the preparatory committee for the production conference, was indefinitely postponed because the implementing agency had not yet been determined. Guo Shun, chairman of the China General Federation of Industrial Associations, and others have specially suggested to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industries, in their capacity as members of the Central Committee, to propose to the Central Political Council that all motions belonging to the government should be executed by the government, and those belonging to the industrial production itself should be executed by the industrial groups. The following is an excerpt from the presentation: (The preceding is omitted) (1) In view of the fact that various controls have failed to fully develop their effectiveness, it is considered that convening the conference itself is extremely empty. (2) The Third Plenary Session did not stipulate the issue of enforcement, so it was resolved that it was only for the government's reference, equivalent to a memorandum of advice. (3) If a conference is convened, the required expenses are roughly estimated to be 18,000 yuan. In recent years, the industrial sector has been affected by the economic downturn, and fundraising has been extremely difficult. A detailed examination of the above are all obstacles to convening the conference in the future, but there is room for transformation in the environment to resolve its difficulties. Moreover, Chinese industrial production is about to collapse completely today. To save it in time, there is no other way than the joint cooperation of the government and the people. Under the guidance of the government, convening the conference can also be regarded as one aspect of the method of saving the country through production. Under this circumstance, we hereby suggest: 1. Please ask the minister, in his capacity as a member of the Central Committee, to submit this case to the Central Political Conference to resolve the enforcement issue in advance. The method is (A) All motions and resolutions belonging to the government shall be executed by the government. (B) Those belonging to the industrial production itself shall be executed by the industrial groups. 2. Please ask the minister, in his capacity as a member of the Central Committee, to submit this case to the Central Political Council and include the issue of the expenses for convening the conference in the proposal for discussion. After detailed calculation, the prescribed amount is 18,000 yuan. It is proposed that the conference decide to allocate 10,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance, and the remaining 8,000 yuan will be raised by the production sector. (The following is omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e128">Aviation Donations Still Underway: The Stance of the Hotel Industry <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The office of the solicitation team of the Municipal Aviation Association held a discussion meeting with the hotel industry in the city at 4:00 p.m. yesterday on the ninth floor of the YMCA. Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao) presided, and Zhou Nianxing took the minutes. More than 50 representatives from major hotels attended. First, the chairman reported that Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to other matters, and he represented him in reporting his views. Then, he briefly described the opinion that aviation donations for the hotel industry must be collected, and the situation of contacting the authorities of the two concessions, hoping that everyone would work hard to be responsible for carrying out the donations, etc. Subsequently, Zou Xieqing, representative of the Zhongzhou Hotel, Zhao Quansheng, representative of the Dajiangnan Hotel, Xu Wenzhao, representative of the Hongfu Hotel, Sun Qiuping, representative of the Asia Hotel, Zheng Shaochou, representative of the Yangzi Hotel, Gao Weifu, representative of the Mengyuan Inn, and Yao Songnian, representative of the Shengtai Inn, successively expressed their opinions. The general idea was that although hotel colleagues have difficulties in collecting donations for aviation for national salvation for the hotel industry, they should work hard to carry out the donations. This is a voluntary donation by the people. No matter what, they must be responsible for handling it, but they should ask the Aviation Association and the municipal government to cooperate to help them carry out the donations, so that they can increase their strength to overcome difficulties. Then, no matter how difficult it is, they will do their part, etc. Therefore, the result of the discussion was that each hotel should continue to work hard to be responsible for collecting aviation donations for national salvation.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Municipal Government Compiles the New Budget for the 23rd Year <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has decided on the principles for the new budget for the 23rd year and ordered various bureaus to prepare it separately. According to the Central News Agency's inquiry with the municipal government, the new budget will use the actual amount received in the previous year as the standard. Although the budget for the previous year was announced with a total amount of 11 million yuan, due to the fact that the land tax revenue was not collected according to the budget, the municipal treasury was in deficit. The new budget has not yet been implemented. The actual expenditure was 10 million yuan, and the new budget for this year will be prepared according to the above number.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant: The Self-Made Ninghai New Aircraft Was Closed Yesterday; Xu Chengqi Was Discharged from the Hospital After Recovery <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that Zeng Yijing, the director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, met with reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday and announced the recent work of the plant in great detail. It is specially recorded as follows: The Ninghai New Aircraft Was Closed Yesterday, according to Zeng, the second new aircraft of the Ninghai ship was started to be closed today (the 25th). As for when it will be completed, it is still difficult to determine at present. It is expected to be in late May. The rumor that it will be test-flown in the next few days is not accurate. The first Ninghai aircraft was sent for repair a few days ago, and it is expected to be completed in the middle of next month. The plant has limited personnel, and is currently rushing to repair the first Ninghai aircraft, so the progress of the second Ninghai aircraft will be slightly delayed.</p>
<p>The Factory Building Project Will Be Completed in August. In order to increase the auxiliary force of the Navy, the Ministry of Navy has specially allocated funds to expand the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Plant. The construction of the factory building has already begun. It started on April 1st and is scheduled to be completed by the end of August. After the factory building is completed, we will find ways to purchase more parts.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengqi Has Been Discharged from the Hospital. Instructor Xu Chengqi was injured in a plane crash and came to Shanghai for medical treatment. Xu's body has now fully recovered. I once asked Xu to move to the naval hospital for a short rest, but Xu felt bored with the life in the hospital, so he was discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday. As for the Jiangfeng aircraft, the plant is currently very busy with work, so it has not yet started to repair it.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Merchants from Northern Jiangsu Present a Document to the Authorities Regarding the Reorganization of Salt Affairs Agencies <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Salt merchants Wang Jianqiu, Tang Xinan, Wu Xiuzheng, Liu Zhuting, Qiao Shuangqiu, Kang Shuwen, Qiu Yuzhou, Zhu Yabo, Yuan Yuetan, Wang Mingxiao, Xu Xiangjiu, and Li Yangren, et al., from Northern Jiangsu, presented a document to the financial and salt affairs authorities regarding the reorganization of salt affairs agencies. The original text is recorded as follows: Presenting [this document] for the auditing concurrently holding positions, outstanding achievements, merchants feeling convinced, looking up to and requesting the approval of public opinion, in order to promote justice, and avoid confusion of black and white. We humbly believe that in times of national crisis and financial difficulties, simplification of government is the priority. The key to simplifying government is to simplify officials. More agencies mean more waste, and even more opportunities for corruption. Under the old system of Chinese salt affairs, administration, anti-smuggling, and auditing were governed separately, without mutual leadership. When an administrative official performed an official duty, he had to consult with the auditors. When an auditor caught a salt smuggler, he had to send a letter to the anti-smuggling agency for handling. For ordinary matters, there was not much difference. In special cases, there were conflicts of interest. Not only were official documents delayed, but also conflicting opinions were generated, and the harm was unimaginable. Moreover, many administrative personnel were corrupt, and the anti-smuggling bureaus were even more deeply flawed. Therefore, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the financial officer believed that various salt affairs agencies were subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. In addition to auditing, they were all superfluous agencies. He specially requested the approval of the Executive Yuan to appoint the director-general of the General Office of Salt Affairs Auditing concurrently as the director of the Salt Affairs Department, and to appoint the auditors of the auditing offices of Xiang, E, Western Anhui, and each bank concurrently as the directors of the Transportation Bureaus of each bank. The managers of the auditing sub-offices of Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Northern Jiangsu were concurrently appointed as the commissioners of each region, and the managers of the auditing sub-offices of Songjiang and Southern Jiangsu were concurrently appointed as the deputy commissioners of the region. Foreign auditors of each region still held their original positions. All anti-smuggling and administrative matters were handled concurrently by Chinese officials. Since the auditing concurrently holding positions in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the national income has increased by 76 million yuan compared with the 10th year of the Republic of China. The expenditure item can save 3 million yuan per year, and the elimination of malpractices has reached 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Taking Zhejiang as an example, since auditing concurrently holding positions, the tax revenue in 20 years and 9 months has increased to 400,000 yuan. After the cancellation of the Wenzhou contractor, the tax revenue has been consolidated to more than 100,000 yuan. The tax police expenses can be saved by more than 100,000 yuan. Taking Northern Jiangsu as an example, since the auditing concurrently holding positions, the tax revenue in the 20th year was 11,545,000 yuan, the tax revenue in the 21st year has reached 12,447,000 yuan, and by the 22nd year, it has increased to 17 million yuan by the end of October, and to more than 20 million yuan by the end of December, which is an unprecedented achievement. As for saving expenses and eliminating black fees, it is only a small matter of tens of thousands of dollars. All the above-mentioned are based on reliable evidence, and are by no means empty words and embellishments, so they can be compared to flattering words. Unless those who rely on malpractices for food and have the intention of holding grudges and sabotage, everyone has a good reputation. However, this is only in terms of finance. Let us analyze it again from the facts that can be called commendable. First, construction: It can be seen that several years ago, there was no direct road for cars from Banpu Yunshe to Yanzhen, there were no tax police distributed, and there was no salt pile as a place to return. Bandits were rampant, salt beaches were abandoned, and merchants suffered from it. Since the auditing concurrently holding positions, car roads are like chessboard, tax police teams are standing tall, and there are salt piles as a place to return. There are telephones in the salt pile, and they can travel back and forth in one day. Anti-smuggling and bandit suppression are convenient. The rivers transporting salt have been dredged for about 100 miles to facilitate transportation and many sluice gates have been built to save water. Self-running water wells have been added in places without drinking water to ensure hygiene. Yanzhen can be called a paradise. The price of salt ponds has increased, and the people of the place whose rural areas are bankrupt and lying on pillows are no less than the difference between heaven and earth compared with the fact that no one has cared about the salt ponds for several years and they have almost stopped operating. This is the merit of construction. Second, anti-smuggling: It can be seen that before anti-smuggling was merged, the anti-smuggling army was named anti-smuggling, but in fact it was releasing smuggling. Smuggled salt spread all over the place. The annual tax revenue was only 10 million yuan, or only 7 to 8 million yuan, or 5 to 6 million yuan. Except for special accidents in the 19th year, the tax revenue increased sharply, and the malpractice of over-sales and backlog was still not eliminated. Since the auditing concurrently holding positions in the 20th year, not only is the regular amount sold smoothly, but also the amount that has not been sold in Jinan for six years will be replenished in the 22nd year in order to enrich the national tax. In the past, people in the five counties and five counties ate coastal salt, but in recent years, official salt shops have been set up in various counties, and the average tax rate is not restricted. Even those who make salt do not eat untaxed salt. There have been people who have applied for an increase in the amount of sales because the amount of sales is too small every month. This shows that there is more official salt and less smuggled salt. The more official salt there is, the smoother the sales market is, and the smoother the sales market is, the higher the tax rate will be. This is a natural cycle. In the past, places such as Tanggou in Shuyang, Linhong in Donghai, Qingsantuan in Ganyu, and various seaports in Guan, Lian, Fu, and Ning were all important ways to smuggle. In recent years, the malpractices have been eliminated and the atmosphere has been cleared. Why are the roads for smuggled salt cut off? It is the merit of anti-smuggling. Third, bandit suppression: In the past, bandits and salt bandits were divided, and anti-smuggling and bandit suppression were also divided. In recent years, bandits and salt bandits have merged, and anti-smuggling and bandit suppression have to merge. In the past, the anti-smuggling camp was often disarmed by bandits in the Longju Dongzhuo Mountain area, and camp officials were also killed from time to time. Therefore, the Yanzhen area was mostly occupied by bandits, and it was common to lift people and rob them. Since the tax police were merged into auditing in the 20th year, Yangji, Wangji, Yaoyu in Guanyun, Longju, Xinba in Donghai, and various borders in Shu, Gan, Lian, and Fu occupied by bandits were all bravely repelled by the tax police, killing and injuring countless people. There are reports on file. All of the above are places far away from the salt beach that rely on the tax police for protection, and why there are no bandits in Taiping, Zhongfu, Linxing, and Jinan Yanzhen? It is the merit of bandit suppression. Fourth, the unification of power: There is no lack of talent in administrative anti-smuggling. In fact, the legislation is not good, people have no guarantee. When the country is in trouble, it cannot fully enforce the law. Therefore, everyone has the intention of being a magistrate for five days. The act of theft is almost like the Yin people will eat without disaster. Even the dignity of the deputy commissioner is only used to entangle matters and has already been wanted. Even the weight of the director is now escaped because of the tax guarantee relationship. The past is not forgotten, and the future is a teacher. It is impossible not to observe it. Since the auditing concurrently holding positions, there is no matter of exercise and accommodation in the administrative process. The anti-smuggling matters are as easy as an arm to use, and there is no suspicion of being too big to fall. Because of this concurrent position, it can resist the interference of foreign troops from the outside, and there is no fear of slanderous books from the inside. It is up to the authorities to trust it from beginning to end. The four items presented above refer to the outstanding ones. They are all achievements after the concurrent positions. If there is no public opinion as a backing, it will inevitably lead to the destruction of public opinion and the accumulation of destruction by those who hold grudges. It is in embellished rhetoric, either saying that sovereignty is lost and handed over to foreigners, or that auditing is arbitrary and abuses its power. If it is said that sovereignty is lost, the country does not have an explicit order for foreign auditors, and foreign auditors have not interfered with the act of concurrently holding positions. If it is said to be arbitrary, it should also examine the facts and not listen to one-sided unfounded words, and then decide on the case of Zeng Shen killing people. For the sake of the overall situation, Jianqiu and others dare not avoid suspicion and resentment, and explain everything in detail. We humbly ask for your approval of public opinion in order to promote justice and avoid confusion between black and white, which is a public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Ministry of Communications Orders Shipping Companies in Shanghai to Vigorously Improve Ship Management and Reform the Malpractices of the Business Department <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Our country's ship management has never had a fixed system, and the number of crew members has never been stipulated. The comprador system of the business department and the tea room system of various cabin classes are the worst habits. The improvement of ship management proposed by the last Promotion of Shipping Conference has been decided by the Ministry of Communications to unify the crew system of sea-going ships and river ships (already recorded in the 20th issue of this newspaper, omitted) and to eliminate the bad habits of the business department, vigorously implement the new system, abolish the comprador, prohibit tea room extortion, improve ship facilities, and rectify pier management. Yesterday, the Ministry of Communications issued an order to the shipping companies in Shanghai to vigorously implement the formulated measures. The following is a summary of its general outline:</p>
<p>Abolish the Comprador and Change to Administrators. In other countries, business management on ships does not use the comprador system, only our country has this abnormal system. When foreign ships first sailed in the mainland of our country, they were not familiar with business, so they hired Chinese people as compradors. This has been going on until today, and domestic merchant ships also have a comprador position, and the system of charging passengers and packages is used, resulting in many malpractices. Compradors only seek to increase their income. Sometimes passengers exceed the limit, causing danger. Last year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company implemented the abolition of the comprador system, but only two or three ships, such as the Pu'an and Xinming, broke this long-standing habit. Now, the Ministry of Communications has decided to abolish all ship compradors. The duties of the business department will be assumed by administrators who are hired by the shipping companies and are familiar with shipping matters in order to break the system of charging passengers and packages.</p>
<p>Revolutionize the Bad Habits of Tea Rooms. For the servants and tea rooms needed on the ship, the shipping company shall hire polite tea rooms, train them, and pay them monthly wages. They are responsible for taking care of the passengers on the ship. The various bad habits of the tea rooms used on the original ships must be thoroughly eliminated, and the number of tea rooms must be stipulated. They are not allowed to solicit alcohol and other expenses from passengers at will. If there is any of the above, the passengers may report to the administrator, who will immediately dismiss and replace them. After the various ships are inspected and determined by the Shipping Administration Bureau, passengers must abide by the specified number. The number of passengers in the economy class must not exceed the limit in order to prevent a major danger from occurring. Pay Attention to Various Facilities. Ship hygiene and cleanliness are not valued by the current ships. It is now limited to ships from 200 tons and above, and the voyage starts from one day to arrival. One to two doctors should be added to the ship to diagnose the passengers' illnesses. Various classes of cabins should pay more attention to hygiene and cleanliness. Isolation rooms should also be set up on the ship so that in case there are passengers with infectious diseases, they can be moved to the isolation room to avoid danger to the public. In addition, ships should depart at a fixed time and should not be delayed at will. As for the piers, marine police should be equipped, and passengers should be strictly guarded when boarding and disembarking and loading and unloading goods, and hoodlums should be driven away.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Dutch East Indies Government Formulates Regulations on Firecrackers and Fireworks, Chinese Merchants Pay Attention <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that according to Li Zejin, director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, our country's firecrackers and fireworks are well-made, and are frequently exported, especially to Southeast Asia. In recent years, the Dutch East Indies has also set up factories to manufacture them, with a total of 31 factories, but the products are immature and the quantity is limited. The average annual value is about 1.35 million guilders, while the average annual consumption of firecrackers and fireworks in the Dutch East Indies is about 6 million guilders, of which 91% are sounding firecrackers, especially firecrackers. 19 of these firecrackers are imported from our country.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Motivation for Formulating Regulations <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The local factories also have considerable achievements, so the establishment of these regulations is to protect the development of local firecracker and fireworks factories. In the past, imported firecrackers and fireworks have never caused any danger. Only local factories have had several explosions due to improper mixing of green salt and chlorate. It is found that sounding firecrackers were previously made with a mixture of saltpeter. However, because the use of this raw material, if not precisely matched and tightly sealed, the sound of burning is often not loud. Therefore, in the future, calcium chloride Calcium Chlorate is used for matching, which is louder and easier to manufacture, but there is often a danger of explosion during matching. The local government issued an order on March 1, 1929 to prohibit it. Local manufacturers could not use Calcium Chlorate Calcium Chlorate for manufacturing. The sound of their products could not compete with imported goods. Therefore, the regulations also prohibit the import of firecrackers and fireworks containing calcium chloride. Those who are allowed to be imported in the regulations are all those that local factories have been able to manufacture effectively, so that the local products and imported goods will not be too different.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Permission to Set Off Firecrackers <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>In addition to purchasing for renewal and paying fees in accordance with the law, there is not much relationship with Chinese and European residents. The government pays special attention to the indigenous people. Most of the dwellings of the indigenous people are thatched huts. It is not without danger to set off firecrackers and fireworks at will. In addition, most of the indigenous people have no budget for economy and have no sense of restraint. Whenever there is a New Year's festival, wedding, or circumcision ceremony, they are proud of setting off fireworks and firecrackers. Often, because the consumption is too large, they are unable to pay the national tax. Setting off firecrackers and fireworks must be approved before the government can easily monitor their economic capacity and restrict them.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Firecracker Import Procedures <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Because the provisions of the regulations, its approval or disapproval, depends entirely on the matching and composition of the raw materials, it is necessary to first submit the samples to the Bandung Firecracker Fireworks Inspection Bureau for chemical inspection to be qualified before paying taxes for import. Otherwise, it will be rejected. In order to avoid this difficulty, exporters should first ask the local Dutch consul to inspect the samples before the goods are shipped, or send them to our country's resident consul or resident consul-general in Jakarta for transfer to the Bandung Firecracker Fireworks Inspection Bureau for inspection. After knowing that it is qualified, it is appropriate to ship it out.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Important Points Regarding Transportation and Sales <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>(1) Article 1 of the Detailed Implementation Rules of the 1932 Ordinance on Firecrackers and Fireworks, Clause (A), Section (Sub-Section): The explosive materials (prohibited raw materials) designated in the laws and regulations promulgated by the Dutch East Indies government in 1893 and amended in 1931 refer to mixtures of the following raw materials: explosive medicines containing gasified substances, picrate salts, blasting powder (green acid), violent explosives, dynamite made with a combination of nitric acid and glycerin, nitro-glycerin and other nitro compounds, Verian explosives, ammonium nitrate explosives (such as</p>
<p>plastic explosives and luminescent explosives, etc.), blasting gelatin, water gel explosives, special explosives, and explosive materials with the same properties as those listed above. Gunpowder made with a combination of niter, sulfur, charcoal, and ink is also included. (Note: Materials without graphite and hard lumps are not included in the prohibition list.) (2) Although calcium gas acid and picrate salts are included in the category of explosive materials, they are indispensable raw materials for the manufacture of fireworks. For example, [Bengal] fireworks, illuminating projectiles, and various other fireworks all use gas acid salts as the main component. The sharp sound effects of rockets, whistles, and cannons cannot be achieved without picrate salts as the main component. Therefore, those who use these materials, if their purpose is not explosion but solely for their light-emitting properties, are not included in the prohibition list. (The sharp sound mentioned in this section does not refer to the explosive sound of firecrackers.) (3) The raw materials mentioned in Clause (B) of Article 1 of the detailed rules are permitted because they are not easily ignited or exploded by vibration or friction. The method used here to check explosive power is to grind the medicinal materials from firecrackers and fireworks between a magnetic pestle and mortar. If they are easily ignited or exploded, they are immediately prohibited. The mortar used has a diameter of 7 centimeters and no glaze inside, while the pestle is 10 centimeters long and also has no glaze on the end that touches the mortar. During manufacturing, one can first test it oneself according to the law. (4) For already manufactured</p>
<p>firecrackers and fireworks, if you want to transport and sell them to the Dutch East Indies, it is advisable to first send samples to the Bandung Firecracker and Fireworks Inspection Bureau for inspection before shipping them, to avoid</p>
<p>complications. It is best to consult with the nearest Dutch consulate regarding the shipment of samples. (Attached is a request form and its translation). Regarding packaging, etc., you should first carefully review the ordinance and its detailed rules.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Ordinance on Firecrackers and Fireworks <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Translated by the Consulate in Makassar as follows: (1) The amount of dangerous firecrackers and fireworks displayed in front of a store (not in whole boxes) shall not exceed 25 kilograms, and other firecrackers and fireworks shall not exceed 100 kilograms. (A) Clause (Note: Dangerous firecrackers and fireworks are detailed in Article 1(A) of the Ordinance.) (2) In a safe location away from crowds, the total amount of stored firecrackers and fireworks in boxes (sealed boxes) shall not exceed 250 kilograms for those with dangerous properties, and 1,000 kilograms for other firecrackers and fireworks. (Note: According to the provisions of Article 8 of the Detailed Rules, when the quantity of firecrackers and fireworks exceeds 250 kilograms and 1,000 kilograms, they should be stored in specially built warehouses. Refer to the original text of the article.) (3) When packing firecrackers and fireworks, a space wide enough to walk through should be left between each box. The markings on the box surface should all face outward, so that they can be easily seen without moving them during inspection. (Note: Pay attention to the full text of Article 7 of the Detailed Rules.) (4) No easily flammable goods should be stored at the same location as firecrackers and fireworks. (5) The delivery and transportation procedures for firecrackers and fireworks should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of Decree No. 10 of the 1933 Government Gazette. (Note: i.e., Article 7 of the Detailed Implementation Rules). (6) If the permit is declared revoked, all firecrackers and fireworks must be handed over within 14 days. (Note: Pay attention to Article 12 and the attached article of Article 12 of the Ordinance, and Article 10 of the Detailed Rules.) (7) All laws and regulations related to safety issues for this type of</p>
<p>business shall apply. (Note: For example, warning signs in Chinese and Western languages should be hung where firecrackers and fireworks are stored, such as [No Admittance for Unauthorized Persons] [No Smoking], etc. It is also advisable not to use oil lamps or candles indoors, and it would be even better to have fire extinguishers available.) (8) When the permit is declared revoked or becomes invalid according to law, the original permit should be returned within 30 days from the date of issuance of the notification. (Note: Pay attention to Article 4 of the Detailed Rules and Article 7 of the Ordinance. If you disagree with the reasons stated in the approval order, you can file an appeal according to the provisions of Article 11 of the Detailed Rules.) This case has been recorded and sent to the Municipal Council, the local administrative chief, the police chief, the fire brigade captain, the director of the Public Works Department of this office, the inspector, the treasurer, and the accountant for their records, and an abstract has been copied and issued to the requester for their retention.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Bureau of Railways Announces: Director Huang's Sick Leave is a Fact; Returning to Shanghai at the Beginning of Next Month to Resume Duty <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau of Railways announced yesterday that Director Huang has taken sick leave due to soreness in his right arm. Rumors that his illness is serious or due to other reasons are all speculation. Director Huang, due to the restoration of the North Shanghai Railway Station and receiving guests for visits in September of last year, felt overworked, which caused the recurrence of his old diabetes. His right arm and</p>
<p>head became sore and painful, making movement difficult. Although various methods such as electrotherapy and massage were used for treatment, they were not very effective. Furthermore, due to heavy official duties, he was unable to rest adequately. Recently, he was persuaded by doctors to decide to take sick leave, which was approved by the ministry. On the 21st of this month, he left Shanghai for Hangzhou and then went to Mogan Mountain for a short stay. Director Huang's diabetes is now gradually improving, and the soreness in his right arm is also gradually decreasing. The news of his serious illness is completely unfounded, and there are no other reasons for this leave besides recuperation. The leave will be at least two weeks and at most three weeks, so he will</p>
<p>return to Shanghai at the beginning of next month to resume duty.</p>

<p>Yesterday, General Manager Liu Hongsheng issued a notice and distributed a staff survey form to various departments, stating in brief that the Bureau had been ordered to implement austerity measures. The staff of each department are to fill in their names, positions, dates of entry into the Bureau, salary amounts, etc., as listed in the form. There is also a remarks column, which is to be filled in by the heads of each department with additional comments, stating each person's diligence, laziness, and the complexity of their work, etc., to be submitted to the General Manager by Friday afternoon of this week for assessment. The staff, upon hearing the news, have become very panicked.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession will hold a review at the Race Course at 3:30 PM on Saturday, the 28th of this month. Brigadier F. Thackeray, the British military commander stationed in Shanghai, has been invited to serve as the reviewing officer. The headquarters of the Volunteer Corps has already issued detailed orders.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a notice was issued to the inmates of the Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. In order to prevent inmates from soliciting agreements or paying bribes, a second notice was specially issued under the authority of the Commander, providing detailed instructions. The original text is as follows: Notice No. 3 of the Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters: Regarding the issuance of a notice, this department has always adhered to the principle of [speedy handling and conclusion of cases, without unjustly punishing or letting go]. However, in order to discover the truth and avoid unjustly punishing or letting go, it is necessary to strive for thoroughness in summoning witnesses, investigating evidence, and studying the facts of the case. Therefore, although the staff members are working diligently, there may still be cases that cannot be concluded quickly despite efforts to expedite them. The head of this department is</p>
<p>very regretful. Recently, it has been discovered that some inmates or their family members hope to escape the law by chance</p>
<p>or be released early, and have engaged in bribery. For example, the family of Shen Guanquan entrusted someone to find a way, and were defrauded of over a thousand yuan. Not only did they waste money, but they also violated the law, which is tantamount to adding crime upon crime. This is both pitiful and hateful. The head of this department is confident that he is fair, impartial, and strict in enforcing the law, and that the staff members also conduct themselves with integrity,</p>
<p>are loyal to their duties, and will not allow the guilty to escape the law, nor will they allow the innocent to be wronged. He will never make any changes due to the solicitation of inmates or their family members, nor will he deign to accept bribes and demean his character. For this reason, all inmates in custody are hereby notified again that they must wait patiently for the trial and earnestly instruct their family members not to engage in such matters again. Those who deliberately violate this will be severely punished. If there are unscrupulous individuals who extort money under false pretenses, please secretly report them to the head of this department for strict investigation and punishment. This notice is issued on the [Day] of April in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Tao Baichuan, Head of the Department.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Representatives of Machine Ice Dealers Petition Party and Government Organs Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the delegation of machine ice dealers convened a meeting of representatives yesterday afternoon. More than 30 people, including Dai Quangen and Ni Jiangfu, attended. Chairman Qiu Haitao reported on the letters to various factories advising and the situation of contact with various parties, and then began the discussion. (1) Appointed Qiu Haitao, Pan Zuqiang, Dai Genfu, Dai Quangen, and Qin Xin as five representatives to continue submitting petitions to party and government organs. (2) Strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from undermining the market, and form an investigation team to work in various places. (3) Investigate the business situation of fellow traders, which will be handled by the investigation team. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The petition is also recorded as follows: Petitioning regarding the scum of machine ice dealers, colluding with people outside the industry, reversing the facts, and the Chinese ice factories being used by them, selling out the market, and disgracing the international community. Attachment: Continued petition requesting prompt handling. The undersigned merchants previously learned that Fu Zhiqing, the manager of the Oriental Ice Factory, colluded with Gu Fuxiang and others from the Weixing Company, the scum of the machine ice dealers, to organize the Xiecheng Company on Hambi Li Road, monopolizing the products of the Shanghai Chinese ice factories and completing a trust, hoping to manipulate it freely. On April 19, we jointly appealed to your Association (Government) (Bureau) to thoroughly investigate and stop this. Now, the Chinese ice factories have unfortunately fallen into their trap. The compromise method is for people from Xiecheng to use their personal names to subsidize Qiaolong Ice Factory 10,000 yuan per year and Guangyi Ice Factory 5,280 yuan,</p>
<p>in exchange for ceasing operations. In addition, contracts were signed with seven factories, including Dahua, Qiahe, Maochang, Hongchang, Yongxin, and Xin Xie Mao, to exclusively sell at the lowest price permanently, and not to sell to others. For this reason, the price of ice has suddenly increased from about 10 yuan per ton to 17 yuan in the past few days. In the future, we don't know to what extent it will increase. A good market has been ruined by a few scum, which is very regrettable. And the few scum of machine ice dealers are still unrepentant, and dare to hold a big meeting to reverse the facts, and on April 23, they published a news item in the local news column of the Shen Bao, "[Managers of Ice Factories and Fellow Traders Held a Meeting Yesterday to Rectify Trade Rules]," hoping to deceive the society. Regarding what they referred to, we will briefly correct it on the left: (1) Gu Fuxiang and others, five or six people, are not machine ice manufacturers, but all belong to machine ice dealers. Qian Acai is the owner of a fruit shop, completely an outsider. How can he participate in the rectification? This is their attempt to deceive the society, and it should be corrected. (2) Fu Zhiqing, who is currently organizing Xiecheng at the Oriental Ice Factory, is the manager of Oriental. How can he be said to have nothing to do with it? This is their attempt to cover up, and it should be corrected. (3) As for the saying that the price of machine ice has fallen and the capital is at stake, it is not true. Because the market price has not changed significantly in the past few decades. Based on the cost over the years, it is at most three or four yuan per ton, while the selling price has been around seven or eight yuan. How can it be said to be losing money? This is their obvious forgery, and it should be corrected. (4) The total number of machine ice dealers in Shanghai is five or six hundred. If they are allowed to hold a big meeting with only six or seven people to organize a joint office, and even want to organize a guild, it is not only a joke, but what else could it be but being commanded by the Japanese? This is their absurdity, and it should be corrected. (5) Furthermore, regarding the engagement of legal counsel, the facts are there, and cannot be concealed by legal counsel. This is their intimidation, and it should be corrected. In summary, the facts are all there, and cannot be reversed. At this time, when the whole country is vigorously promoting the New Life Movement and striving to strengthen the national power, Gu Fuxiang and the Oriental Ice Factory dare to destroy it arbitrarily and risk being unrighteous. It is very hateful. Therefore, a copy of a Shen Bao news item, as well as a list of the number of people organizing Xiecheng Company and a statistical table of all Chinese and foreign ice factories in Shanghai, are attached, and we continue to submit them to your Association (Government) (Bureau) for review and prompt handling, which is for the public convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Yang Bingxun vs. Cai Zhaolu Lawsuit Judgment <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yang Bingxun, the inventor of Chinese shorthand, was sued by his disciple Cai Zhaolu from Dongtai, to the Hui Sili (Mixed Court) for biting his ear. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court continued the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. According to Yang Bingxun, after the previous postponement, he had once contacted to reach a settlement, but it failed because the plaintiff demanded 1,000 gold, etc. The court then advised both parties to make concessions, as they were teacher and student, but the plaintiff insisted that 2,000 gold was the minimum, so mediation was impossible. The trial then proceeded. Cai Guanglu's testimony was the same as before, while Yang Bingxun testified that at the time, he was brutally beaten by the plaintiff and his brother Zhaozheng, and his wife Ni, and his head was dizzy, so he did not know how the plaintiff's ear was injured. He also presented the carter Wang A'er and the maid Zhu Xiaoshi as witnesses. Wang and Zhu testified that they saw the defendant being beaten by the plaintiff and shouting for help. The investigator handling the case then presented evidence proving the investigation situation, and it was seen that the defendant's door had indeed been broken. Finally, Jiang Baolian, the lawyer for the police station, argued that based on the testimonies of both parties and the witnesses, it could be determined that the plaintiff went to the defendant's room to beat him, but although the defendant denied biting the plaintiff's ear, it was obvious that the defendant may have bitten the plaintiff in self-defense at the time. As for whether the self-</p>
<p>defense was excessive, the court should consider it, etc. After the defendant's lawyers Yan Luqing and Da Yaoxian made their defenses one after another, Judge Zhan declared in court that Yang Bingxun was guilty of harming another person's body and was fined 100 yuan. If he chooses to serve time instead, one yuan will be equivalent to one day. Yang indicated that he would consider whether to appeal. The court then ordered a bail of 200 yuan during the appeal period.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that Yutai Yongde Yuanhe and other commercial firms in Yingkou have now sold more than 5,000 catties of ginseng, worth more than 600,000 Japanese yen. They have sent personnel to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to establish branches and promote this large amount of ginseng, etc. The reporter inquired with the ginseng industry in this city yesterday. It is said that people from Pingjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Minyue (Fujian and Guangdong) all regard ginseng as a tonic, so although there are no accurate statistics on annual sales, it is believed to be a very large number. Ginseng is produced in the Changbai Mountain area and has always been distributed to various places. Now that the Northeast has been occupied, this production and sales have long been seized. The Japanese are now engaged in encouraging the cultivation of ginseng in that area, and have sent personnel to Beijing, Shanghai, Minyue, and other ports to promote it. Yutai Yong and Deyuan Yong, two ginseng firms, recently sent personnel to Shanghai to promote it to various ginseng firms, and it is also heard that they will establish a firm in Shanghai to manage it. Therefore,</p>
<p>it is generally believed that the ginseng market will be completely manipulated by the Japanese in a few years.</p>

<p>City property No. 44, next door to the east of Xietai Wine Shop on Dongxin Bridge Street in the French Concession, was burned down on the night of the 13th of this month, leaving a lot of charred wood materials, which were coveted by ordinary "tramps." At 2:10 PM yesterday, about three to five of these people went to dismantle it again. Carelessly, they caused the wall along the road and part of the house to collapse. At that time, a Route 5 tram was passing by, and it was hit, immediately cutting off traffic. As many as ten trams were connected and stopped. The police station, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to suppress it. On the one hand, they notified the fire brigade to drive to dig. Until dusk, two "tramp" corpses were dug out, and they were immediately taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Morgue for examination, and a report was requested from the Second Special Court for examination.</p>

<p>Kidnapper Fei Xiangqing, a native of Ningbo, 40 years old, and Xu Arong, a native of Yangzhou, 35 years old, colluded with accomplices to hold weapons at 11 PM on the evening of December 24 of last year to kidnap Tao Changhai, a local resident, near Laobazi Road on North Henan Road. He lived at No. 182 North Sichuan Road and was a compradore at Ellis &amp; Hays &amp; Co. on the same road. They hid the hostage at No. 91 North Henan Road and demanded a large ransom. Subsequently, Hua Inspector Lu Liankui of the Public Concession Inspection Department learned of it and went to rescue the hostage Tao Changhai with the help of Chinese and Western detectives. Fei, Xu, and more than a dozen other men and women were arrested and taken to the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation, Xu and Fei were sentenced to death and were approved by the superiors. The police station brought the two prisoners to the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning. Judge Shen Shanzeng presided over the court and asked Fei and Xu if they had any last words and sent letters to their families. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, stated that the families of the two prisoners had arrived in court, and Fei's wife, Zhu, was related to the case and was sentenced to three years in prison, which she was serving. Now her son had arrived in court, etc. According to his son, Fei Sanmao, 15 years old, Fei Xiangqing shed tears when he saw his son and said that he was sentenced to death for breaking the law, which was his own fault. He hoped that his mother's brother and Chen's mother would buy a coffin and go to the execution ground to collect his body and transport it to the guild hall for placement by a transport truck. Do not use charity coffins. After your mother is released after serving her three-year sentence, the mother and son should live a peaceful life. You must find a legitimate business, and send your sister to relatives in Hankou, etc. Xu Arong was calm and told his mother and wife that they did not need to be sad. His wife was holding a child and instructed her to raise it well and return to</p>
<p>their hometown as soon as possible and take his corpse to the execution ground, etc. Judge Shen then instructed the two prisoners to be sent to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for execution. Chinese and Western police immediately took them down, together with the case files, photos, etc., and escorted them to the Caoh</p>

<p>Every summer, cholera tends to spread in this city, causing great harm. In view of this, the central health authorities and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, in the early summer of previous years, joined forces with the health departments of the concessions to organize a joint epidemic prevention agency to prevent and control cholera, with considerable success. As the end of spring is approaching again, in order to make proper arrangements in advance to curb the occurrence of cholera, the Director of the National Health Administration, Liu Ruiheng, specially took the night train to Shanghai on the night before last (the 23rd). Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., he convened the first meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room to discuss the preparatory matters for prevention.

<p>Guo Zibin, a wealthy Chaozhou merchant residing in Wenheli, Dagu Road, had assets of no less than ten million yuan. He had five sons. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, Zibin, due to his old age, divided his property and made a will. When Zibin died the year before last, his sons heard the news and rushed to Shanghai to attend the funeral. When they wore filial attire, they saw a mourning couplet hanging in front of their father's spirit, which was sent by their stepmother, Fang. Fang paid someone to write the couplet, but the tone of the couplet insulted the sons. The sons were displeased, believing that their stepmother, Fang, had deliberately insulted them. Therefore, the eldest son, Huatang, removed and collected the couplet. Later, Huatang and his four brothers decided that if their stepmother ever infringed on their reputation or property, they would jointly negotiate with her. All rights and obligations should be jointly responsible, and contracts should be sold and sealed as proof. Subsequently, Huatang and others found that their father had 14,000 taels of silver deposited in the Fuyuan Qianzhuang in Japan, under the name of San Linshi. There were also 18 shares of the Hongyu Yarn Factory on Maigen Road, with a capital of 10,000 yuan per share. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, due to losses, the factory was sold to the Wing On Company. All shares were valued at 2,500 yuan per share, totaling 45,000 yuan. All of the above funds were collected by the stepmother, Fang, and should be handed over and distributed proportionally. It was also found that in the nineteenth year of the Republic, their father had asked lawyer Yuan Hanyun to revise his will in Japan. This will was also hidden by Fang and refused to be handed over. Therefore, they hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to file a lawsuit against their stepmother, Fang, in court. However, the trial resulted in a loss. Huatang and his four brothers all expressed their dissatisfaction, and</p>
<p>further found that their father Zibin also had two pawnshops, Renyuan Pawnshop and Baoxing Pawnshop, with a total deposit of 1,400 yuan, which had recently been privately transferred by the stepmother, Fang, to the name of her son, Wenzhong. Evidence has already been found, and this point proves that the above two facts have been undoubtedly embezzled. Therefore, they still entrusted lawyer Wu to file an appeal, and the court will soon open for trial. It is also heard that the funeral expenses after Zibin's death amounted to as much as 100,000</p>
<p>yuan, which was used to sell 108 shares of HSBC Bank shares that Zibin had allocated in Japan for charity, and entrusted</p>
<p>a certain qianzhuang to handle the sale, the proceeds of which were used. It can be said that it was the most extravagant funeral in Shanghai in recent years.</p>

<p>At around 3 p.m. yesterday, police officers Chen Zhirong and Xin Maosong of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team were patrolling the river on a patrol boat when they suddenly saw a sampan with license number 793</p>
<p>coming from east to west near the Taikoo Wharf. They saw that the boat was carrying two passengers and a large wooden box. However, when the two passengers saw the patrol boat parked in front of them, they suddenly looked flustered and restless, which aroused the suspicions of Officer Chen and others. They immediately stepped forward to block their path and ordered them to stop. After boarding the sampan, they carried out an inspection. Because the large wooden box on the boat was very heavy, they used their bayonets to pry open the box lid. After careful inspection, they discovered that the box secretly contained 13 rifles, 10 revolvers, 1,010 rifle bullets, 670 revolver bullets, 9 leather gun holsters, 4 ammunition boxes, 5 leather belts, and a canvas cover, worth approximately</p>
<p>several thousand yuan. They immediately escorted the two passengers who were transporting the wooden box, along</p>
<p>with the boatman, Zhou Xiaoluozi, a Shandong native, back to the team. When Chief Zhu and Deputy Chief Li conducted a preliminary interrogation of the case, one of them, Huang Achang, 43 years old, a Guangdong native, confessed that he was a worker in the storeroom of the British Taikoo Company in Pudong. These firearms were ordered by Cai Qijie, the Chinese bookkeeper in the storeroom, to be transported to the office of the Taikoo Company in Puxi and handed over to a Westerner named Shige (translation). As for whether they were being sold or if there were other circumstances, he did not know. The other passenger, Lu Yaoming, 40 years old, from the same hometown as Huang, and Huang's partner, confessed that he was helping Huang Achang transport the wooden box this time, and did not know the other circumstances. The boatman, Zhou Xiaoluozi, confessed that he was 21 years old and had been hired by Huang and others to transport the wooden box to Puxi, but he did not know that the box contained so many guns. Because the incident involved the smuggling of a large number of firearms, they immediately wrote a report and sent the arrested witnesses to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation at around 6 p.m. last night.</p>

<p>The Traffic Department of the Two Roads Administration issued a letter to all stations yesterday, stating, "It has been found that porters at each station still swarm onto passenger trains and compete to carry luggage when passenger trains arrive. This not only disrupts the order of our railway, but also hinders passengers from getting off the train. Moreover, mistakes are easily made or items are lost in the rush, leading to criticism from the outside world. This department has repeatedly strictly prohibited this, and it should be strictly enforced. In the future, when passenger trains arrive, porters should line up in an orderly manner on the platform about two meters away from the passenger train. They must not rush onto the train unless called by passengers. Each stationmaster should be fully responsible</p>
<p>for handling this matter. If there are any violations of this regulation, they should be reported immediately for severe punishment. Do not conceal or neglect them, lest you fail in your duties. In addition to distributing this document, the traffic section chiefs of each section should forward it to all for compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Update on the Water Cut-Off in Peideli - Requesting Fairness from All Organizations <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Peideli, Dazha Road, Xinzha, was cut off from water at 10 a.m. on the 24th because the landlord, the Catholic Church, failed to collect additional water fees. The houses in Peideli total more than 100 buildings, and the tenants number about 3,000. Drinking water is indispensable, and once it is cut off, they suffer greatly. All the residents held an emergency meeting the night before last and immediately sent more than one male and female representative to the Xinzha Police Station to report the water cut-off situation and request an emergency stop. The police station used the telephone to inquire with the Water Company, and the Water Company sent Chinese and Western officials to the police station to explain. They said that the Catholic Church had sent a letter to the Donation Bureau of the Municipal Council, and then the Donation Bureau ordered the company to cut off the water. If there is a reason, you can negotiate with the Donation Bureau. However, yesterday morning, the tenant representatives negotiated with the Donation Bureau of the Municipal Council, and the reply was that there was no such thing. It can be seen that it is actually a pretext of the Water Company. Yesterday, various alleys in the neighborhood posted many slogans such as "Illegal water cut-off, inhumane" and "Respectfully request assistance from all walks of life," and satirical pictures. On the one hand, lawyer Wang Hangu has been hired as a legal advisor to send a letter to the Catholic Church on behalf of the tenants, giving a serious warning. A letter was also sent to the French Consulate, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, requesting fairness and providing immediate assistance. It is also heard that yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m., most of the women in the neighborhood intended to rush into the Qiude Girls' School run by the Catholic Church to fetch water. The principal notified the Xinzha Police Station, and many Chinese and Western police officers were dispatched to suppress the situation, preventing an incident from occurring.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Doctor Ke Shengcang Sued - City National Medical Association Already Replied to the Court - Still Needs the Identification Report from the Shenzhou Pharmaceutical Association <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Feng Heqing, a Ningbo native and employee of the Commercial Press, lives at No. 17 Yangzhengli, Tangshan Road. His nine-year-old son, Xiangguang, suddenly</p>
<p>suffered from fever and chills on February 22nd. The next day, he invited Dr. Ke Shengcang, a Chinese medicine practitioner from Ningbo, to diagnose him at No. 30 Xianggli, East Xihua Road. He believed that it was a case of injured tendons due to a fall and prescribed a prescription containing the medicine of raw soap beans. However, after Feng Xiangguang took the medicine, his whole body ached, he had more than ten consecutive diarrheas overnight, his fever increased sharply, and the situation</p>
<p>worsened. He then hired other doctors to treat him, who diagnosed that Dr. Ke had made a medication error. Now, Xiangguang's condition has turned into scarlet fever and he has been sent to an isolation hospital. He has not yet recovered. Feng Heqing then hired lawyers Shen Zongyu and others to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Ke Shengcang of negligent injury. The Special Court has already summoned Ke twice and ordered him to pay a bail of 200 yuan, pending the submission of the prescription to the Shanghai National Medical Association and the Shenzhou Pharmaceutical Association for identification and verification of the facts. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the continued trial of this case had arrived. Both the plaintiff and the defendant arrived at the court with their respective lawyers. The Shanghai National Medical Association has also sent a reply to the First Special Court. The content mainly concerns the two points inquired by the Special Court: (1) The child is nine years old, of medium build, if due to a fall and injured tendons, resulting in a hard, red, and swollen lump on the inside of the left hip, fever, and constipation, can he take the prescription? (2) If the superficial syndrome of wind and cold has not been relieved, is there a possibility of pneumonia due to the misapplication of the prescription? Regarding the first point, there is</p>
<p>nothing wrong with taking this prescription to relieve the superficial syndrome, disperse blood stasis, relieve pain, and promote bowel movements. Regarding the second point, it does not seem</p>
<p>likely to cause pneumonia. The</p>
<p>corresponding reply was sent. The presiding judge, Deng Fangcun, issued this reply to both parties for</p>
<p>viewing. Because the witness, Dr. Yuan, did not arrive today, and the identification report from the Shenzhou Pharmaceutical Association has not yet been submitted, he briefly interrogated the plaintiff and defendant and ordered a rescheduling for seven days later. The defendant will remain on the original bail.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Fires in Southern Shanghai in One Day: Over Ten Houses Destroyed on Old Granary Street <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>At house number 141, a three-story building on Old Granary Street inside the Old North Gate, lived Zhou Ziquan and over ten other families. Due to the complexity of the residents, yesterday morning around 5 a.m., a fire broke out in the east wing of the building, in the home of Zhou Yilin, due to carelessness. The fire quickly intensified, breaking through the roof. Upon learning of the fire, various fire brigades rushed to the scene and worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze. The fire was finally put out around 10 a.m. As a result, besides the minor losses sustained by the stove shed belonging to Ye Arong, the three-story building and all the belongings of the residents were completely destroyed. The losses were quite significant. Only the second landlord, Zhou Ziquan, had insured the property for 3,000 yuan with the American &amp; Foreign Insurance Association, and Hongtaichang Chinese and Foreign Goods Company had insured for 3,000 yuan with the North China Insurance Company. As for the rumors that Li Guifu and Zhou Yilin had also insured, this has yet to be confirmed. At the time, all the neighbors were startled awake from their dreams. Chaos ensued, and police officers arrived to maintain order and investigate the cause of the fire. However, Zhou Yilin and Li Guifu, fearing punishment after causing the disaster, fled and disappeared without a trace. As a result, the second landlord, Zhou Ziquan, Yang Xiaofu, the adopted son of the third tenant Li Guifu, Chen Shichang, an old tailor from Pudong who guaranteed Zhou Yilin's rent, and Zhu Wangshi, a woman from Tongzhou residing at number 10 Hengde Lane in the Nine Acres area, who acted as a guarantor, were all taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

<p>Also, yesterday morning around 8 a.m., a fire broke out at Zhang Shunxing Construction Company in Dejing Lane on Huining Road in the South City, caused by sparks from cooking. Half of the kitchen was destroyed. Upon learning of the fire, the West District and other fire brigades quickly dispatched fire trucks to the scene. The fire was already being vigorously extinguished by neighbors, so the fire hoses were not used. At the time, Niu Asi, a resident of Guan Factory in the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, from Nanxun, was detained for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Additional Information on the Insult to the Zhenru Postal Worker <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union issued a statement, saying that the recent report about the Ministry of Communications advising postal workers to be mindful of etiquette, and involving the Zhenru Post Office postal worker's explanation of postage to a sender, contained many inaccuracies. Postal workers, as state public servants, have always treated the public with humility and courtesy. They are especially patient in explaining postal regulations to those who are unclear. However, the incident that occurred at the Zhenru Post Office involved Chen Liangru, a researcher at the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute, who forcefully insisted on mailing publications with insufficient postage through the post office and falsely claimed that he had registered for preferential treatment at the post office. The postmaster, Mr. Ma, thoroughly checked the bureau's instructions regarding publications registered as newspapers but found no record of the said publication. He explained this to Mr. Chen and presented the bureau's instructions for him to read, to avoid any misunderstanding. Unexpectedly, Mr. Chen became enraged, slammed the table, and shouted, "How dare a mere postmaster like you make things difficult for me! I will complain to the Ministry of Communications!" He even boasted that Zhu Jiahua was his relative, making a great show of his power and acting unreasonably. Postmaster Ma, realizing that Mr. Chen was beyond reason, reported the entire situation to the management bureau, requesting them to negotiate with the research institute to restrain Mr. Chen from abusing his influence and to issue a warning. This is a brief account of the truth. As for the previous report that the Ministry of Communications ordered the Directorate General of Posts to thoroughly investigate the truth, alleging that the postal worker's attitude was arrogant and made people uncomfortable, it is feared that this was due to being deceived by Mr. Chen, or perhaps there were other emotional factors at play, which are unknown to outsiders.</p>

<h3 id="e174">How to Collect and Identify International News (2) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I gave a general description of the nature of international news and the knowledge that should be possessed to identify international news. Today, I will further describe how to read international news in Chinese newspapers. - Editor</p>
<p>Chinese newspapers have never paid much attention to international news. In the past, only a few major cities along the coast and the Yangtze River had a row or two of international news in their daily newspapers. As for magazines that systematically discussed international affairs, there were even fewer in the past. Now things are a little different. Because China is so greatly affected by the international situation, and more and more people are demanding international knowledge, newspapers and magazines have gradually begun to pay attention to this aspect. In terms of daily newspapers, Shanghai's Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shishi Xinbao all have a considerable amount of space to publish international news. Other newspapers such as Zhonghua Daily, Min Bao, Shi Bao, Chen Bao, Damei, and the two evening newspapers, Da Wan, also do not neglect the publication of international news, and the materials are relatively rich. In other cities, such as Nanjing's Central Daily (officially run) and China Daily, and Xinjing Daily, they also publish important international news. The Jing Bao and Chen Bao in Beiping, the Dagong Bao and Yishi Bao in Tianjin, and the major daily newspapers in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Hankou all have an international news column. Although most of the international news in these newspapers is first seen in the Shanghai newspapers, some of them are first seen in Beiping, Tianjin, or Guangzhou. This is because Beiping is still the political center of North China, Tianjin is the hub of international trade in North China, and Guangzhou is the political center of the Southwest. Their exposure to international developments is sometimes direct. Recently, we should also pay attention to the daily newspapers in Nanchang and Jiujiang. Although they are inland newspapers in nature, the amount of international news is very small, but because Nanchang has in fact become the general hub of Chinese politics today, most of the important meetings and important national policies are decided here. In the daily newspapers here, you can sometimes get fragments of international and Chinese news.</p>
<p>Reading international news in Chinese newspapers is very different from reading international news in foreign newspapers. Generally speaking, in foreign countries, the international news published in national newspapers is largely consistent, but in our country, it is completely different. This is because other countries have control over the news industry, newspapers are large in scale, have wide circulation, have strong economic power, have complete means of transportation, and have a large number of talents, and can send special reporters to various important political and economic centers in the world. Chinese newspapers cannot do this at all. Chinese news not only cannot control itself, but on the contrary, foreign news agencies almost control the Chinese news industry, at least in the international news section. Where do Chinese newspapers get their international news from? They rely on foreign news agencies. The most famous foreign news agencies that supply news in China are the British Reuters, the French Havas, the German Transocean, the American United Press, the Japanese News Alliance and Telegraph Communication Company, and the Soviet TASS. Because they all have different political and economic backgrounds, they directly invade the Chinese news industry by means of political and economic power. Naturally, the articles they issue are only to defend their own national policies, and they contradict each other. This is a characteristic of international news in Chinese newspapers. For people who occasionally read international news, they see many contradictory records of the same international event and do not know who to believe, which is a bit confusing. However, people with experience in reading newspapers find it particularly convenient to understand the truth and falsehood of international events.</p>
<p>Naturally, when reading international news, it is necessary to first check the source of the news and understand its political position and background. First of all, pay attention to the news agency that issued the article. It is not necessary for us to explain the positions of the above news agencies in detail. Except for TASS, which has its own background, the others can be said to be imperialist aggressive forces. The difference is that their respective interests are different and they are mutually antagonistic.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should understand the habit of Chinese newspapers in editing international news. Because Chinese newspapers have always adopted a so-called "objectivist" approach to the publication of international news. That is, many different reports on an international event are published in one place. At the same time, small headlines are used, declaring [X's opinion], [X country's attitude], or [X news agency reported it this way]. What the truth is, let the readers compare for themselves. But this often makes people bored, because the same news is described from various aspects, there are always some repetitions. Careless people will naturally just read a part of it and put it aside. However, experts in collecting international issues and careful readers should not be afraid of trouble and must not be satisfied with adopting a certain opinion. This is the most noteworthy point. This is also the most valuable material.</p>
<p>Third, when checking an international news item, do not discard it because it is a fabricated rumor. You may not believe it, but you should treat it as a companion material. Because even if it is a rumor, it itself has news value. Why does country A fabricate such a rumor against country B? What is the role of the rumor? A person who studies international news (if he has the attitude of a scientist) must pursue the root of the rumor. For example, Japan often spreads rumors that the Soviet Union is increasing its troops in the Far East, etc., in order to cover up the ironclad evidence that it has indeed increased its troops in our three northeastern provinces. There are many examples of this kind. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, no matter how difficult the problem is, there is always a way to solve it. When the driver or his assistant, the fireman or his assistant, and the brakemen—there were six of them in all—needed to eat or sleep, they could all return to the half-car attached to the back of the water truck. While eating, although it was difficult to stand or bend over, they were all very skilled in squatting, and they could squat to eat or drink tea. We often see Chinese laborers who also like to squat at ordinary times.</p>
<p>Then how about sleeping?</p>
<p>No one can sleep standing up! Even those laborers who are accustomed to squatting cannot sleep squatting! As long as the car moves slightly, they will fall down. But don't worry, there is another very clever way! This method is also commonly used by people in the palace. For example, I am absolutely not allowed to sit in front of the Empress Dowager unless she gives me special permission to sit. Even when she is sleeping and it is my turn to serve her, I cannot sit on any chair or stool privately. But I can sit on the floor or lie on the floor—only lacking a comfortable pillow. Because when I sit or lie on the ground, my body is always lower than her old body lying on the bed, so it does not count as a violation of the law.</p>
<p>The laborers on these cars completely imitated our method.</p>
<p>Although they cannot sit or sleep squatting, they can lie on the floor! In this way, they are always lower than the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager in her car, either sits on her throne or lies on the bed. The bed is of course much higher than the floor! (20)</p>

<p>— Xiong Wan</p>
<p>Bathing in the warm spring sun, I stepped onto this White River Bridge very lightly and comfortably. The breeze blows across the bridge along the river bank, bringing a lot of rapeseed flower fragrance. The river under the bridge flows slowly, reflecting the sunlight and shining brightly. From time to time, a car whizzes across the bridge; several rickshaws lazily drag across; and several people stroll across with a smile. They are all very natural. Whizzing, dragging, strolling. However, am I too nervous? I always feel that this scene is a bit strange: what the breeze brings is not the fragrance of rapeseed flowers, but it seems to be a bit fishy. The flowing river water is somewhat reddish, like blood. This blackened White River Bridge shows its hideous face, just like the face of General Shirakawa, who slaughtered and burned Shanghai two years ago. I was angry, but I was also afraid. I ran down the bridge in a panic and ran back to Wusong. A large wheel drove in from the Huangpu River, and a red round flag fluttered on the boom. I, nothing!</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Nationality of the Mandarin Orange <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Egg</p>
<p>Years ago, when I first arrived in Shanghai, I saw what were called "Siamese Mandarin Oranges" displayed on fruit stands, and in the fruit sections of major companies as well.</p>
<p>This type of orange (actually a tangerine) is more common in the South, yet its nationality isn't specified there. However, once it arrives in Shanghai, it becomes Siamese. When did it acquire Siamese citizenship, or is it truly from Siam? And would the climate of Siam even produce this kind of orange? Even the owners of the large fruit stalls are vague about these questions. They simply call it "Siamese Mandarin Orange" because that's what it's always been called.</p>
<p>In reality, this "Siamese Mandarin Orange" isn't from Siam at all. It is a genuine domestic product, like the Butterfly brand is a domestic star, with no counterfeiting involved.</p>
<p>Besides rice being the major export of Siam, pomelos and mangoes also hold considerable importance. Since pomelos are also found in Guangdong and Fujian, their sales in China aren't as good as mangoes. In the Chinese market, Shanghai's mango supply is almost entirely dominated by Siam. While Luzon's "Ivory Mangoes" are also famous, they are rarely seen. Siam certainly has oranges, a type of tropical orange that is greenish-yellow in color, with a thin skin and sour taste, and not particularly outstanding.</p>
<p>The so-called "Siamese Mandarin Oranges" currently sold in Shanghai fruit stalls are actually the "Pepper Tangerines" from Chaozhou. (Editor's note: Mr. Bohong wrote to say they are called "Jiang Tangerines," produced in Chaoyang.) A genuine domestic product, yet everyone stubbornly treats it as a foreign variety, even attracting the attention of thoughtful individuals like Mr. Wei Jing, implicitly calling for a boycott. Truly, before even leaving the country, it's become an alien. If oranges had feelings, they would deeply resent this.</p>

<p>Chapter 28: Coincidental Viewing of the Opera, Foolish Love Found in a Handkerchief; Diligent Inquiries About Illness, Misunderstanding Through a Letter</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, two things left the biggest impression on people: one was the sound of firecrackers at night, and the other was the Spring Festival couplets pasted on people's doors. The absence of firecrackers at night filled Gan Jizhi with many emotions. The next morning, while seeing a guest to the front door, he noticed the red paper fluttering on the doorways of houses along Haidian Street, all bearing Spring Festival couplets, and every door tightly shut. Adding to this were two or three children in new clothes passing by, which made him realize that today's atmosphere was indeed different from usual. After a while, Gan Houzhi went to the government office as usual, and Mrs. Gan invited a few neighbors over to play mahjong, leaving only Jizhi alone in the study. He thought to himself, today is a holiday after all, and sitting at home like this is rather boring. Those Spring Festival couplets on the street are a form of folk literature, why not go and investigate them in person? He could then write a short essay and submit it to a newspaper, perhaps earning a few manuscript fees. With this in mind, he forgot his vow from the previous day not to leave the house. He put on his coat, took a pencil and notebook, and headed out onto the street. He looked at twenty or thirty houses, and found that the couplets were mostly old and cliché, but interestingly contradictory. One butcher shop had the couplet: "Peaceful Times, Benevolent Family." A coffin shop had: "The Seats Are Always Full of Guests, The Jug Is Never Empty." A midwife's house even had the small couplet: "One Person Has Celebration, Five Generations Will Initiate." He wasn't sure if the word "initiate" was intentional or a mistake, but the first line, "One Person Has Celebration," was highly inappropriate coming from a midwife. Imagine how many births she attends, and yet only one person has a celebration, wouldn't that be too tragic? (371)</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Record of the Renovation of Guyi Garden <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Haiyang Yuyin</p>
<p>The spring night banquet in the peach and plum garden had Li Bai write a preface for it. The completion of the Joyful Rain Pavilion had Su Shi write a record for it. The ancients rejoiced in their experiences and recorded their magnificence, which was well-founded. Guyi Garden was founded during the late Ming Dynasty, and through the Qing Dynasty to the present, it has been over four hundred years. It has been repeatedly ravaged by war and repeatedly renovated. In the founding years of the Republic of China, it was renovated and refreshed by predecessors and various businesses in the town. In the year of Jiazi (1924), it was destroyed again. During the January 28th Incident, the Four-Sided Hall became a place for tying horses. The pavilions, towers, corridors, and paths were trampled beyond recognition, with only the Mandarin Duck Hall still barely habitable. Initially, Mr. Wang Quantu suggested establishing a Basic Committee for the Mandarin Duck Hall, fostering their dependence. A simple constitution was drafted, and a dozen people signed their names, simply to preserve the historical site, with no grand ambitions for large-scale renovation. In the autumn month of that year, colleagues celebrated Mr. Lu Jingwen's fiftieth birthday, holding a banquet at the residence of Mr. Li Liangcai, and during the banquet, Mr. Lu proposed raising funds to renovate the garden, contributing one hundred silver dollars from his birthday gift money as an initial contribution. Thereupon, colleagues initiated fundraising, and with the sincere support and generous donations of gentry and businessmen from near and far, the collective effort proved easy. Construction began gradually on the twenty-second day of the second month of Guiyou (1933), and was completed by the end of the year after ten months. During this period, workers were hired, materials were procured, walls were decorated, paths were cleared, and flowers and trees were replanted. Suddenly, magnificent buildings stood in rows, shining brightly, and from afar, the trees appeared lush and the atmosphere was magnificent. The desolate scene of the past has been transformed in a short time, and now the gates are crowded with carriages and tourists like clouds. The construction of a large building cannot be supported by a single piece of wood; the reconstruction of an ancient garden cannot be accomplished suddenly by the efforts of one person. As the poem says, "Planning and building it, it will be completed in a short time." If not for the enthusiasm and dedication of the gentlemen involved, how could this have been achieved? As the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way," and now it has indeed come true. I, being unworthy, am fortunate to be a part of this, joyfully witnessing its completion, and humbly write this record.</p>

<p>— Fu Gong</p>
<p>An ancient intention paints flying rafters, charcoal forming heaps. How many times has a fragrant heart and noble spirit turned to ashes? Bitterly shedding tears of a flowery age like embroidered zithers. Lost in intoxication, the beauty cannot be called back. Imitating the style of Geng Bai, I invite you to join in composing: The red flower beside her temples sways even more gently. The maiden's life is free from all worries. Lightly applying Parisian powder to her cheeks. Wearing clothes that flatter her figure, bearing the brand's seal. Her subtle words reveal she understands from the start. Her passionate emotions pour out like a waterfall, hard to contain. Three years of missteps become a hollow dream. This night urges one's hair to turn completely white.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Research on Inkstones (A Summary of Thirty-One Studies) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wuliao Ke</p>
<p>The ancients' research on inkstones can be described as meticulous in every detail. For example, regarding the use of inkstones, fresh ink should not be heavily ground, and boiling water should not be occasionally used; hence, there is the so-called "Method of Using Inkstones." Regarding the cleaning of inkstones, heavy stains should be rubbed with floating charcoal, and ordinary cleaning should use lotus seed pods and soap beans; hence, there is the so-called "Method of Cleaning Inkstones." Furthermore, what materials are suitable for making inkstones, and what materials are suitable for lining them; hence, there is the so-called "Method of Storing Inkstones." Regarding the use of inkstones in winter, how to prevent damage and how to prevent freezing; hence, there is the so-called "Method of Warming Inkstones." Regarding repairing damages, how to utilize stone powder and how to forge wax; hence, there is the so-called "Method of Repairing Inkstones." All of these aspects indeed have some artistic flavor, but they are too trivial, so they will be briefly omitted. However, the most relevant point in terms of culture and art is the ability to distinguish between genuine and fake works, which must be studied in detail. As for how to study and distinguish between genuine and fake, the Japanese have a method that can be introduced to everyone.</p>
<p>The Japanese say: It is very difficult to judge the authenticity of poems, inscriptions, and colophons carved on ancient Chinese inkstones. If we want to study ancient Chinese inkstones, we must put effort into ancient calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy. Fortunately, China has recently begun to openly study calligraphy and painting, so we can carefully examine the authentic works of calligraphy and painting to compare and verify the authenticity of the inkstones. For example, if Gao Fenghan carved inscriptions with his left hand, then we must pay attention to whether the calligraphy attributed to him has the same structure and posture. Huang Xintian's carved inscriptions truly have a characteristic Fujian style, and only by seeing more works by Huang and other Fujian artists can we recognize their strengths and weaknesses. Jin Dongxin's style of calligraphy and painting is a variation, and variations are easily imitated, so we must first know the depth of his academic ability and the source of his brushwork before we can gradually distinguish between genuine and fake. Also, for works by Gao Fenghan, Ji Xiaolan, and others that have rubbings, we should study them carefully from the rubbings. There are some famous people who are skilled in calligraphy but not in seal carving, so they hire famous seal carvers to carve seals on their behalf. In this case, it is very difficult to discern whether the original state has been preserved. The Yuan Qifeng Inkstone (Mi Fu's legacy inkstone) collected by Emperor Qianlong was inscribed in his own hand and carved by a famous seal carver, and it is valuable because it was able to maintain its original spirit. In short, to study authenticity, we must widely collect all kinds of inscriptions, clerical scripts, stele inscriptions, and other epigraphic writings, as well as authentic calligraphy and paintings, and diligently look at, compare, and study them every day, without being tired of it. Naturally, we will be resourceful and our knowledge will increase day by day.</p>
<p>Here, I must declare: I introduce this method not to genuinely encourage people to use this method to study ancient inkstones. I only believe that no matter what kind of literature, art, or science is studied, one must start with this foolish and laborious approach. The Japanese are able to use this foolish and laborious approach! Therefore, their country has made such progress. China has many clever people who know immediately upon seeing and understand immediately upon hearing, but they are unwilling to bury themselves in learning foolish methods and putting in laborious effort, so they ultimately achieve nothing. If they continue to rely on their cleverness and are unwilling to start with foolish methods and laborious effort, not only will new culture and new science ultimately lag behind others, with no day of development, but also the few remaining inherent and incomplete learning arts will be abandoned, and in the future, to know something about ancient learning arts, we will have to make a living from the Japanese. What a heartbreaking thing this is! Pointless talk about inkstones is originally for leisure and amusement and has no great relationship with literature and art. It is up to you whether you read it or not, whether you study it or not. However, this last sentence, I hope everyone must remember it firmly, only then this article will have some small meaning.</p>

<p>Sun Che of Shanxi Province, our country's 10,000-meter athlete participating in the Far Eastern Games, recently sought treatment at the Red Cross Hospital for pneumonia. It was thought that he would recover quickly and win glory for the country. Unexpectedly, the tragic news arrived yesterday. Mr. Sun, suffering from both pneumonia and liver disease, passed away suddenly at 12:30 AM last night (the 24th) before he could be treated. In total, he was only in the hospital for three days. Not only does this mean our country has lost a hope in the Far Eastern Games, but it is also a major loss for the sports community in our country. Alas!</p>
<p>Relapse of Old Illness According to Ma Yuehan, the coach of our country's Far Eastern Games track and field team, according to Mr. Sun himself, he had a history of liver disease, which would recur from time to time,</p>
<p>but he didn't take it seriously. This time, his old illness relapsed. At first, he didn't take it seriously. Then he caught a cold, and his lungs were also affected. The symptoms this time were different from before. He jokingly said to Mr. Ma, "My illness is different, I'm afraid I won't be able to return home." Mr. Ma scolded him for his wild talk and comforted him with kind words. He was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Hague Road for treatment.</p>
<p>He Died Suddenly The doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, but at first, they didn't think it was serious. On the second day of his admission, Mr. Ma still thought he would recover soon. Unexpectedly, his condition deteriorated sharply, and both illnesses broke out together, leading to his death. He passed away around 12:00 AM on Sunday night. The tragic news spread quickly, and everyone was shocked and lost color. Yesterday morning, the Association and Mr. Ma took care of all the funeral arrangements and placed the coffin in the Shandong Guild Hall on Wangzhi Road.</p>
<p>When the coffin was being prepared in the hospital, all the Far Eastern Games athletes in Shanghai went to the hospital to pay their respects and express their condolences. Telegram to His Family Mr. Sun belonged to the Second Regiment of the Zhengtai Railway Guard in Shanxi. Yesterday, the Association urgently telegraphed the Shanxi Provincial Department of Education and the Second Regiment of the Railway Guard in Yuxian County, Shanxi, led by Regiment Commander Lang.</p>
<p>His Record Mr. Sun participated in the North China Far Eastern Games preliminary rounds in Tianjin this time. He set a new national record of 34 minutes and 1 second in the 10,000 meters. In the Shanghai preliminary rounds on the 14th of this month, he still achieved a result of 34 minutes and 49 seconds, breaking the national record and winning the championship. Such talent, yet Heaven did not grant him long life. What more can be said?</p>

<p>Our country's track and field re-selection competition was held at the China Track and Field Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, including the high hurdles, 800 meters, 1500 meters, and 400 meters events. The results of the tests were: Lin Shaozhou finished the high hurdles in 16.8 seconds, and Dai Shuguo finished the 400 meters in 54.3 seconds. After reviewing the results, the selection committee deemed that the performances of these two individuals met the standards and they were selected.</p>
<p>In each event, there was only one person. Other athletes joined in midway to encourage their speed. Lin's high hurdles technique was excellent, and 16.8 seconds seemed like he hadn't exhausted his full potential. There is still room for improvement in the official competition. Dai Shuguo's 400 meters performance didn't seem great. Also, Wang Mingshen, the famous general from the Northeast, had a mediocre performance in the 800 meters, and Chen Xingpei's 1500 meters performance was also not selected. Wang's strength has not yet recovered after his illness. It is difficult to recover in a short period. It is hoped that Mr. Wang will take good care of himself.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Ministry of Education Maintains Local Education Funding: Taxes Used for Education Remain Unchanged Until Firm Compensation Is Provided, Executive Yuan Instructs the Ministry of Education to Order Provinces and Cities to Comply <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>News from the education sector: In order to maintain local education funding, the Ministry of Education submitted a request to the Executive Yuan in February of this year and issued a circular to provincial and municipal governments, stating that taxes used for education funding should strictly comply with the Measures for Guaranteeing Local Education Funding. Until a firm and equivalent compensation is provided, the status quo should be maintained to preserve education. The Executive Yuan believes that abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes is an important policy of today, but education is tied to the lifeline of the nation, and guaranteeing education funding is also not to be neglected. Local governments should urgently consider proper compensation for these types of taxes, taking into account both considerations. Therefore, the Executive Yuan issued a circular to provincial and municipal governments to investigate various harsh and miscellaneous taxes and scheduled a meeting in June of this year to plan for the abolition and compensation measures. The intention is none other than to reduce the burden on the people while still preventing major impacts on local affairs. Because the Ministry of Education's request to maintain the Measures for Guaranteeing Local Education Funding is for the sake of planning compensation and is not inappropriate, it has been instructed to the Ministry of Finance to inform them, and the department has issued a special instruction to provincial and municipal governments to handle the matter jointly. It is understood that the department has already issued instructions to education departments and bureaus across the country to instruct their subordinates to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Tong Xingbai Speaks: The Knowing and Doing Problem of the New Life Movement <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>(1) Chen Dongbai's Notes: The Modern Thought Society recently held its third academic lecture in the auditorium of the Provincial Shanghai Middle School, inviting Mr. Tong Xingbai, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, to speak on the topic of "The Knowing and Doing Problem of the New Life Movement." The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>Chairman, fellow students, today I am very happy to be invited by the Modern Thought Society to come here to give a lecture and to meet and talk with you. Today I am talking about [The Problem of Knowing and Doing in the New Life Movement]. This problem seems too abstract and difficult to explain, because [knowing] and [doing] seem to involve philosophical problems. Today, let's combine the knowing and doing problem with the New Life Movement to study it. After studying it, we can know how to do the New Life Movement. If we find a correct path, we will not be at a loss and confused. This is very meaningful for promoting the New Life Movement. I will now explain it to you in several points.</p>
<p>First, the historical explanation of the New Life Movement: Many people say that the New Life is the opposite of the old life, and the New Life is opposed to the old life. The New Life is good, so the old life must be bad. But according to my research, this is not the case, because the New Life wants to restore propriety, justice, integrity, and shame, and propriety, justice, integrity, and shame have flourished for a long time in Chinese history, so the old life is not necessarily bad. Therefore, I advocate that it should be divided into three names, one is the [New Life] that we are currently talking about, one is the [Old Life] in Chinese history, and the other is the [Bad Life] that has developed in the last hundred years. The reason for advocating the New Life is to correct the bad life, and to create a New Life, we must find its advantages in all the lifestyles in history for reference. Therefore, these three kinds of life, the New Life, are in line with the current era and our living environment. The Old Life, although it has its advantages, has too many formalities and is not in line with modern life. Talking about the New Life as a standard, the Old Life is too much, and the Bad Life is not enough. Too much or not enough is not in line with our lives.</p>

<h3 id="e223">In Memory of Mr. Xiang Songmao <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>It has been more than two years since Mr. Xiang Songmao disappeared. Based on the evidence from various sources, there is no doubt that Mr. Xiang was murdered. The cruel and vicious hands of the enemy cause everyone to feel heartbroken and indignant. Moreover, society's loss of a kind, amiable, and enthusiastic supporter of domestic goods, Mr. Xiang, has especially dealt a major blow and sacrifice to the domestic goods industry. I still remember five or six years ago when the reporter wrote an article in the Machine Union Journal titled [How Capable is Mr. Songmao, Recovering 3.6 Million Yuan in Rights Each Year], and more than two or three hundred people wrote letters wanting to meet Mr. Xiang and visit his Guben Soap Factory. Because before Yinben soap, the soaps we used every day were all foreign soaps. Mr. Xiang, with his perseverance and ambition, took over the factory run by the Germans and managed it himself, enduring all kinds of hardships and difficulties to achieve today's success. He was also able to produce new drugs to replace imported medicines. How could such achievements not inspire admiration and respect? Therefore, Mr. Xiang's actions deserve to be called the perfect person in the domestic goods industry. In the history of domestic goods, he can be immortal for thousands of years. I hope that comrades in the domestic goods industry will continue Mr. Xiang's unfinished business with Mr. Xiang's perseverance and spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Highly Important Regulations Regarding Country of Origin Labeling <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, the Jianghai Customs issued a notice stating: "[The implementation of the 'Regulations Regarding Country of Origin Labeling for Imported Goods' has been postponed to July 1st of this year, as announced on November 22nd of last year. Now, according to government orders, the implementation of the 'Regulations Regarding Country of Origin Labeling for Imported Goods' should be further postponed, and further instructions will be issued once a specific date is set.]"</p>
<p>Upon reading this notice, one cannot help but feel apprehensive. Whose obstruction is causing this repeated postponement, and whose intention is it? The only lifeline for protecting domestic goods relies on this condition. Curbing the cunning tactics of inferior goods being disguised and sold as genuine products depends on these regulations. Now, the government is unwilling to implement even this basic self-imposed regulation and hesitates to act firmly. What hope is there for the future of domestic goods? Alas, weak nations have no diplomacy. Now, even customs administration cannot be managed. Pity the factories, pity the domestic goods industry.</p>
<h3 id="e225">A Chat About Domestic Goods <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Although white sugar cannot be mentioned in the same breath as firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea, it is nevertheless a daily necessity in the household. Because those who enjoy sweets need it constantly, and even those who do not like sweets add a bit when cooking to balance the flavors. Therefore, white sugar has become a necessity in the household.</p>
<p>Our country produces a lot of white sugar, enough to supply the entire nation. However, after Taiwan was ceded to others, white sugar production suddenly decreased. In addition, in recent years, it has suffered from the dumping and squeezing of foreign sugar, causing the domestic sugar industry to decline. In fact, it's not just the sugar industry that's like this; all other industries have suffered from the exclusion of foreign goods and have declined. Furthermore, the Chinese people's habit has always been to conserve what they have and not to research and improve. Therefore, the Chinese white sugar to this day is still not white but yellow. However, although the color is yellow, the taste of the sugar is indeed sweeter than foreign sugar. But although foreign sugar is not very sweet, the color is indeed very white—almost like snow—deserving the name "white sugar." Probably because foreign sugar is snow-white, most people like to buy foreign sugar, so the sales of foreign sugar are very large. According to the statistics of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and the customs, the annual import of foreign sugar reaches 14 million piculs, worth over 10 million yuan, ranking second in the import volume of foreign goods. Look at this number; it is shockingly high! Who would have thought that this small white sugar would have such a huge annual drain, and those who advocate domestic goods have overlooked this item. But now, I urge those who advocate domestic goods to pay attention!</p>
<p>White sugar is said to be made from sugarcane. And in Sichuan and other provinces of our country, because there is too much sugarcane, they dry it and use it as fuel. Isn't this too regrettable? —See the Sichuan investigation by Mr. Gu Zhizhong and others—Hopefully, the great industrialists of our country will pay attention to it, so that the sugar industry of our country can be revived and there will be no more of this huge drain, which is what the people of the country hope and expect day and night!</p>
<p>In addition to foreign sugar, there is another kind of drain that is also considerable. What is it? It's Wrigley's chewing gum. According to the investigation by the Ministry of Industry, there is an annual drain of more than two million yuan. And Shanghai accounts for half of it—one million yuan—Tianjin has about 200,000 yuan, and Beiping has about 120,000 yuan. The rest are sold in Hankou and other ports.—And Guangzhou Province, Fujian Province, and the southwestern provinces are not included in the statistics.—Imagine that this extremely small Wrigley's chewing gum has so much drain every year. This must be thanks to those fashionable men and women!</p>
<p>Let's start advocating domestic goods from these trivial things, compatriots! Work hard! Work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e226">Three Different People <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Now there are three different people; please examine them:</p>
<p>A: wears a serge long gown and a straight-collared waistcoat made of tribute wool. B: wears a cloth long gown and a straight-collared vest made of tribute wool. C: wears a spring tweed Western-style suit.</p>
<p>These three people represent the most common clothing of our Chinese people, but Western-style suits are not common in rural towns. People wearing long gowns and vests can be said to be the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Furthermore, long gowns, vests, according to the system, have been around for hundreds of years. Their styles can be said to be inherited! Not only inherited, but they can be said to be passed down by ancestors! In the beginning, they were all Chinese silk fabrics, such as Ning silk, spun silk, and damask satin, etc. Wearing them for at least decades. For example, when an old person no longer wants to wear them, they take them to alter and let their son wear them. When the son no longer wants to wear them, they take them to alter and let their grandson wear them. Grandfather and grandson wear them for three generations, and the material has not been worn through. Then they take them to alter and let the grandson's younger brother wear them. This is genuine Chinese goods, worn for decades. What could be more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Now it's different. After making a piece of clothing, one often doesn't wear it for a few months before it has a hole, or the pattern starts to fray, or the color fades. Not to mention not wearing it for decades, it's even difficult to wear it for a year. It is said that these materials that cannot be worn for a year are foreign goods from faraway lands. This is truly unjust! Chinese people should wear durable Chinese goods. Why buy foreign goods that are not durable? There is a reason for this: [People's desire to win is the same everywhere.] Because of this, if one person wears foreign goods and feels proud of it, others will go and look at the style. Later, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of people are like this. Enough, enough. Everyone takes pride in wearing foreign goods, and Chinese goods have no way to go. Gradually, the prices of agricultural products fall, the rural economy collapses, the market is depressed, and unemployment increases. The situation of the endangered and precarious is coming head-on.</p>
<p>Let's examine the three people, A, B, and C:</p>
<p>A: His serge long gown, the serge for the face, is foreign goods, and the camel hair for the lining is Chinese goods. The straight-collared vest made of tribute wool is foreign goods.</p>
<p>B: The cloth long gown is Chinese goods, but his straight-collared vest made of tribute wool is foreign goods.</p>
<p>C: The whole suit is foreign goods.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, they all have some foreign goods. But Chinese serge, tribute wool, and spring tweed are all available. So why not use them? It all depends on one's own change of mind. So why not wear domestic goods? I believe that in the near future, there will be no such different discoveries among the three people. In other words, [everyone uses domestic goods, and there will no longer be three different people, and wherever you look, everyone will be wearing the same domestic goods.]</p>
<h3 id="e227">Will the Women's Domestic Goods Year Be Redeemed? <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Time flies, and two-thirds of the [Women's Domestic Goods Year] has already passed! This Women's Domestic Goods Year has added a lot of liveliness to this sluggish market, but it is not uncommon to see it being used as a tool for promoting foreign goods in a blatant manner!</p>
<p>The fashionable girls and wealthy wives in the women's world regard money as insignificant and casually pick fashionable goods to buy. After using them for a short time, they discard the old and replace them with new ones, squandering again! If they continue like this for the rest of their lives, hoping for the redemption of the Women's Domestic Goods Year check is like climbing a tree to catch fish! They are only seen generously redeeming for foreigners and even think of themselves as the smartest women. The figures for things like cosmetics, perfume, and chewing gum are astonishing! I hope that the women's world will quickly realize that the money redeemed for foreigners should be turned into domestic goods redemption for the Women's Domestic Goods Year, occupying the most glorious page in the future history of the revival of domestic goods! I hope that the women's world will quickly take action!</p>
<p>Observation Notes</p>
<h3 id="e228">Record of Visiting the Completion of the New Tai Kang Factory <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Chucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tai Kang Canned Food Company purchased land next to Fenglin Bridge in southern Shanghai to build a new factory. On April 15th, it held a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the new factory and invited guests from all walks of life to visit. Chucheng went there at 9:00 a.m. that day. The colorful archway at the entrance reached the clouds, fully decorated with electric lights, shining brightly. After signing in, I went to the living room. On the wall hung many plaques presented by Chairman Chiang, such as [Enterprise to Save the Country] and Mayor Wu Tiecheng's [Promote Welfare and Industry]. After meeting old friends such as Fang Shiru and having refreshments, I was led by him to visit. The entire factory is divided into management, engineering, and administrative departments. The engineering department includes eleven sections: biscuit manufacturing, machine manufacturing, can manufacturing, canned food manufacturing, candy manufacturing, Western pastry manufacturing, Chinese pastry manufacturing, bread manufacturing, preserved tangerine peel manufacturing, biscuit packaging, candy packaging, and chemical inspection. Workers are divided into permanent and temporary types. There are about 200 permanent workers, whose wages are calculated by work. Temporary workers' wages are determined according to the complexity of the work. Wages are calculated by piece. Both men and women are employed. When working, male workers wear blue cloth uniforms, and female workers wear white cloth cheongsams, clean and tidy, which is rarely seen in food factories. In the canned food manufacturing department, bamboo baskets are piled up like mountains, and dozens of female workers are unpacking</p>

<p>— Chu Jianping</p>
<p>Wearing a stiff, foreign lead-skinned Western suit, entering a grand department store, taking out a textured leather wallet, and saying the name of an item in English to the clerk; how imposing and magnificent!</p>
<p>If you want to instantly become a comical figure, just shout "Half a catty of Huadiao wine" or "A bottle of Yuanliang liquor" next to the champagne bottles in any dance hall. It will guarantee you a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, on Yuyuan Road in the Town God Temple, I saw a gentleman in loose robes buying a squeaking rubber kitten from a black market peddler. "Is this a Japanese product?" The patriotic gentleman asked.</p>
<p>"It's clearly printed in English on it, so of course it's a British product." The black market peddler pointed to "Made in Japan" as proof.</p>
<p>This gentleman was probably afraid of revealing his ignorance of English and being scolded as a boor by everyone. So he pretended to be an expert and bought one.</p>
<p>The bamboo shoots are cut into strips and placed in a four-foot-high, five-foot-square cement container. After seasoning, they are cooked in a pot. I said to Mr. Fang, "Qin Shaoyou's poem about bamboo shoots says, 'The beautiful color is as lovely as jade cut with a knife, and the pure fragrance is endless as a dragon is cooked in a tripod.' Today, we are here watching young female workers cut so many fresh bamboo shoots with knives and cook them in huge pots. It can be said that we have feasted our eyes. If Shaoyou saw it, I don't know how he would dance with joy." After cooking, they are put into cans and placed on a conveyor belt, automatically transported to the steaming room, which is very convenient. After looking at all the departments, the biscuit-making machine is the most magnificent and interesting. First, there is a machine that mixes flour, milk, white sugar, and other ingredients, rotating endlessly, evenly weighing. Then, there is a machine that cuts the flour mixture into blocks, about one and a half feet wide, two feet long, and one inch high, continuously. The flour blocks are transported to the front machine, pressed into thin sheets one minute high, connected to each other. At first glance, it looks like a bolt of white cloth. Rolling to the front, the machine presses down and prints patterns on the dough, cutting it into round or square shapes, and leaving it on iron plates. It then enters the oven, which is one zhang wide, five zhang long, and six chi high, with three fire doors. The surroundings are built with white porcelain bricks, and the hot air rises without leaking out. After baking, it is poured into bamboo containers and transported to the packaging department by elevator. It is said that this machine was newly purchased from the UK in 1933. With rapid production, the cost can be reduced. To compete with foreign goods, we have to work hard like this. I deeply admire the factory's officers and am happy to record it.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Promote Domestic Goods - Build Hankou - A Free City for the Country <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yanxiang</p>
<p>Hankou was originally the second largest commercial port in our country, but now it has been reduced to the sixth largest commercial port, falling behind Guangzhou and Tianjin. Looking at Hankou's position, it is still the center of our country's hinterland, but it has declined due to the influence of various environments. One reason is that the Longhai Railway extends to Haizhou in the east and Tongguan in the west, so goods from Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Henan provinces all travel east via the Longhai Railway, bypassing Hankou. Second, the shipping on the Sichuan River and Xiang River is developed, and ships from Chongqing, Yisha, Changsha, and Yuekou directly reach Beijing and Shanghai, without transshipment in Hankou. Third, the Yangtze River waterway has not been dredged, and it is becoming increasingly shallow, while the Xiang River is silting up year by year, making it difficult for goods to flow smoothly and reducing exports. This is based on transportation. Other disasters caused by soldiers and bandits and the loss of the Northeast are important reasons for Hankou's decline. Now, people generally believe that the revival of Hankou will be when the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is completed, and the entire line is open to traffic, when it can regain the commercial leader in Central China and hold the transportation hub between the North and the South. I don't think so. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is expected to be open to traffic in four years, and the Yuping Railway is also being built. In the future, goods from Yunnan, Guangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou will definitely be transferred to the Yuping Railway in Zhuzhou and travel east to Shanghai and Hangzhou, which is faster and more convenient than transferring to river ships in Hankou. If the future Eastern port can be completed, this route will be even shorter than traveling down the Yangtze River. Therefore, when the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and the Yuping Railway are completed at the same time, the Hankou market will have no benefit. Moreover, when the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is completed, the Wuhan Railway Bridge has not yet been built. The river surface is vast, and the tide rises and falls about fifty feet. Even if a train ferry is set up across the river, it will be much more difficult than between Nanjing and Pukou and difficult to achieve in a short time. Therefore, goods coming north from the southern section will stop in Wuchang and cannot reach Hankou. Furthermore, judging from the terrain of Hankou, the areas along the river are mostly tidal flats, accumulating silt and sand, making it difficult to moor large ships. In the future, unloading docks and warehouses will be mostly set up on the Wuchang side, and Hankou will only remain a commercial market. Hankou's terrain is low-lying and humid. The northwest sides are blocked by railways. Outside the railways, there is no market at all. East of the railways, there is only an extremely narrow area, which is already crowded and difficult to expand. In the future, factories will definitely be set up less in Hankou.</p>
<p>According to the above observations, it is fundamentally difficult to revive the Hankou market, which will further hinder the promotion of domestic goods. Because the Hankou market is not developed, the industry will not prosper. Industrial products rely solely on imports from other ports, and the market will be even more impoverished. Moreover, the imported industrial products and consumables are all foreign goods. Domestic industrial products and consumables from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiujiang cannot come to Hankou either. Foreign goods rely on the protection of their tariffs. When transported from Shanghai to Hankou, they do not need to pay taxes again. Domestic goods manufactured in Shanghai have already paid tariffs on imported raw materials and coal. When their products are transported to Hankou, they have to pay tariffs again, which is actually a double taxation system and a reverse protection tax system that protects foreign goods and encroaches on the domestic goods market. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e231">China National Products Company Spring Sale with Special Prices <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Since the China National Products Company (Nanjing Road Continental Mall) held its Spring Sale on April 17th, the total daily sales have exceeded the records of all previous sales, which was unexpected by the company. The reason is that the company was extremely cautious in importing goods before the sale, and all those that would hinder sales were not imported. As a result, the seasonal spring products currently on sale are all unique in Shanghai. Customers from all walks of life have praised them. For example, the standard crepe in the silk and satin department is 1.5 yuan per foot, buy one foot get one foot free; Tai Zhen crepe, is 60 cents per foot, buy one get one free. The department's custom-made fashion is comfortable and fits well, which is unprecedented and deeply welcomed by the women's community. In the fabrics department, Bailai ne is 38 cents per foot, buy one get one free; Dazhong ne is 32 cents per foot, buy one get one free. The Samsung brand cosmetics in the cosmetics department, some are sold at special prices, some are buy one get one free, which is also a rare opportunity. Today, the flat-bottle Gui Na hair tonic is 80 cents per bottle, buy one get one free. Other departments also have very special products that are popular with all sectors of society.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Worth Introducing Domestic Pediatric Medicine Partridge Vegetable <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Foreign pediatric pills sell in large numbers in the domestic market every year, which is alarming. The owner of Guangzhou Hongxing Pharmacy, seeing this, invented a kind of partridge vegetable, in order to stop this drain. The medicine is mild and effective, and it is good for treating all kinds of children's diseases and also helps children grow. Children from one to eleven years old, suffering from malnutrition, worm infestation, milk regurgitation, night crying, epilepsy, stomach pain, headache, abdominal distension, constipation, teeth grinding after sleeping, sallow complexion, thinness, etc., all kinds of miscellaneous diseases, once taken, the effect is miraculous. It is truly a sacred medicine for children. The price is low, and the method of administration is simple, requiring only half a cup of boiled water to brew it. It is even better than other kinds of pills and powders. It has been sold in South China for many years. Everyone in Guangzhou, Siam, Annam, Singapore, and the Philippines knows the effect of partridge vegetable and regards it as a family secret treasure. The box surface is printed with a portrait of the inventor Zhang Siyun, and the printing is exquisite. Now, in order to facilitate patients in this city and North China, we have entrusted Changfaxing in Huayefang, Jiujiang Road, to be the sole agent.</p>
<h3 id="e233">New Domestic Goods News for a Week <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaofu</p>
<p>(1) Guo Weiping and Zhao Bingren, special envoys of the Northwest Domestic Goods Mobile Exhibition Group, have arrived in Xi'an after contacting Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. They have telegraphed the Shanghai domestic goods factory to prepare products, which can be shipped at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>(2) Jiangxi Province's planned porcelain factory is in sight, and Mr. Du Chongyuan is preparing in Gan.</p>
<p>(3) Ding Yusan invented an automatic sewing machine, which has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and granted a five-year patent. (4) Xiang Kangyuan, general manager of Kangyuan Canning Factory, went to Nanyang to raise capital, which was very popular with overseas Chinese in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh Penang, Bangkok and other places, and the results were very good.</p>
<p>(5) In order to expand the domestic goods movement, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall has decided to hold a spring domestic goods exhibition from May 1st, with a continuous exhibition for three weeks. More than 100 factories in this city are prepared to participate.</p>
<p>(6) The Shanghai Chinese National Cotton Fabric Market was organized by Du Yuesheng, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Renzhi, Yu Zhendong, Zhang Rongchu, etc. After four months of planning, the internal layout has been renewed. Since the establishment of the market in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, it has officially opened on April 21st.</p>
<p>(7) The Shanghai manufacturer representatives Fang Jiange, etc. of the Changsha Domestic Goods Exhibition have arrived in Hunan, and the exhibition will officially open on May 1st.</p>
<p>(8) China Bank recently noticed that my country's industry is backward and foreign goods are flooding the market. Factories operated by Chinese people with strong capital can obtain considerable assistance; however, those with smaller scopes feel a lack of working capital and it is difficult to develop. Therefore, a kind of factory loan is being offered, which is said to be based on assisting small-capital industries operated by Chinese people as a principle. The methods are divided into overdraft, discounting, and mortgage. This is also good news for small industrial circles.</p>
<p>(9) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce notified all industries that banners and slogans should all use domestic goods.</p>
<p>(10) The two trade associations of the silk and satin industry and the electric silk weaving factory in this city have had their silk and satin for sale in Guangzhou detained by Zhongxing Company, which contracted the special tax on imported foreign cloth in Guangdong Province, with a total of three to four thousand bolts. At this time when the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is in great decline, this blow is very harmful. Representatives Lou Fengshao and Gao Shiheng and others have also petitioned. Now it is learned that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has fully accepted all the points of the petition and has telegraphed the Southwest authorities, requesting them to release them as soon as possible, so the result is satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Homecoming <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Because I had to catch the train, I got up earlier than I had in two years. The train was leaving at nine o'clock, and I arrived in Suzhou a little after eleven. I got into a rickshaw, but because I didn't know where to go, I asked it to stop when it reached Quanmen Road.</p>
<p>But do I really not know where to go? No, it's not that I don't know, it's just that I'm hesitating. Although I've wanted to go see Miss -- for so long, now that I'm really in Suzhou, I can't decide whether to go see her or not.</p>
<p>Regarding Miss --, I've heard several people praise her in front of me. Afterwards, I paid attention to her articles -- they were indeed not bad, and I read several of her lectures. The good thing about her articles is that they are not pretentious, whether they are written by a literati or a woman. So I always wanted to go see her, but I couldn't find an excuse to go see her. I was embarrassed to tell my family that I ran to Suzhou specifically to see her, and I wouldn't even do that to myself. That would seem too formal, at least in her eyes. And I had never gone to see someone I didn't know like that, and without an introduction. For her, I decided: either don't go, or if I go, I definitely won't use an introduction. I was just waiting for the excuse to come. And finally, it came, which was the wedding of one of my relatives. So I decided to personally offer my congratulations. On the night before I left, I got her address from an editor over the phone, although I didn't hear it very clearly.</p>
<p>[I've wanted to go see her for so long, why don't I go see her?] I asked myself as I walked.</p>
<p>[-- Bay? Do you know -- Garden?] I finally blurted out to a rickshaw puller who was trying to get my business [--- Garden? I know it. It's --- Garden.]</p>
<p>[Where is it?] I was a little distrustful. [Inside -- Gate.]</p>
<p>That's right, I heard -- Gate clearly. The rickshaw puller asked me to stop and wait for him to pull the rickshaw over.</p>
<p>[I don't want it now; I have to eat something.] I was still hesitating. I gave him a few copper coins and didn't want his rickshaw.</p>
<p>[I can wait while you eat,] he said stubbornly, recommending this restaurant and that dim sum shop.</p>
<p>I still refused him and just walked on my own.</p>
<p>But after I had eaten my dim sum and came out of a shop, still not very sure, I saw the rickshaw puller squatting on the footboard of his rickshaw, waiting. As soon as he saw me, he stood up and let me get into the rickshaw.</p>
<p>And so, I was taken to the door of Miss --'s house without any trouble, thanks to the rickshaw puller's persistence.</p>
<p>As I got out of the rickshaw, I saw a young lady ringing the doorbell. I thought it was her, so I told her who I was looking for. She said she was at home; the door opened, and she guided me to sit in the living room.</p>
<p>Soon, Miss -- came out. [Oh, Mr. Lin, we've met,] she said with a smile as she stepped through the door of the living room. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e235">Regarding Children <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Da Ye</p>
<p>The boys were idle and looking for something to do for fun. They were tired of many old toys, so they said, "Let's do literature!" Then A-Da wiped his snot and wrote a novel. A-Er threw aside his rubber ball and said, "If you write a novel, I'll critique it!" A-San said, "I smoke cigarettes, so I'll do cigarette literature!" A-Xi said, "I heard a joke yesterday, so I'll tell jokes!" The little girl Xiao-Mao was holding a pencil and drawing flowers on drawing paper, muttering, "You're all doing literature, so I'll do art!" So, for a while, they all buried themselves at their desks and worked hard.</p>
<p>The adults heard that the children were all quiet and were very surprised. They looked and saw that they were all buried at their desks, so they said, "Let them play! Just don't make a scene in the market..."</p>
<p>Moreover, with such a comparison, the adults and gentlemen will again be unhappy! But please don't look down on children! Isn't "Ren Jian Shi" (The Human World) a famous chapter in Zhuangzi? Taking the book of Zhuangzi as an example, its ultimate state of inaction is probably returning to one's original state and transforming into a child. Zhuangzi is consistent with Laozi. Laozi does not oppose "infants". Most of those in the world who dislike infants are Buddhists. In the Shingon sect, "fearless infant mind", "fasting mind of a foolish child" and "heart of a different-born ram" are listed together. But this doesn't matter. The master of humor does not believe in Buddhism.</p>
<p>It seems that today we advocate humor, tomorrow we advocate smoking, and the day after tomorrow we oppose phlegm-filled poems (although I myself reluctantly echoed an old man in a poem, which is not necessarily free of phlegm). Suddenly, we discover that the essay is the orthodox form of literature! -- (This is like a prodigal son suddenly finding a small pearl in a broken cabinet and shouting, "This is still worth something!") Alas! This is why this "Daoist brother" is a "child"!</p>
<p>"If you want to walk the great path, do not show the small paths; do not contain the great sea in a cow's footprint, do not equate the sunlight with a firefly"! Therefore, acting as a benevolent and righteous person, wearing out the crown of one's head and wearing out one's heels, although it may not be kept secret, but sitting in the Yellow River breach and still feeling complacent will inevitably make people feel sad. If we are advocating, it is more meaningful to advocate greater things! Is the success of essays in the past fourteen years the result of advocating essays? Or is it the result of advocating Western culture, which is a thousand times greater than essays?</p>
<p>Bookstores don't sell Western literature books; they are competing to produce children's textbooks and toys. Sellers and buyers are both saving effort. In the remaining mountains and rivers, only "children" like a crowd of monkeys can be accommodated, unable to do anything and unwilling to do anything. To save society, only humor and essays are left. Encourage them!</p>
<h3 id="e236">How to Read Zhou Zuoren's Poetry <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Recently, someone who has not yet achieved fame, in Ren Yan Zhou Kan, Ten Days Talk, Contradiction Monthly, China Daily and Free Talk, using pseudonyms to contribute articles, has systematically attacked "Ren Jian Shi". It is like a wild fox discussing Buddhism or a leper discussing immortality. I don't want to argue. But there was another article in Free Talk criticizing Mr. Zhou Zuoren's personal attitude. Today, after reading Mr. Cao Juren's "Mr. Zhou Zuoren's Self-Congratulatory Poem," it resonates deeply with my heart, and I feel I have something to say. Yesterday, I received a draft from Mr. Zhou and Ren Jian Shi, with a short note attached: "I received a letter from Mr. Liu Dajie, who said that reading my clumsy poem made him shed tears with sadness. I greatly admire this kind of interpretation." (The original letter has been forwarded to Mr. Liu, so this is a summary of its main points). I replied to Mr. Zhou's letter. Although I have no copy, the gist is as follows... This poem is certainly meant to be interpreted in this way, expressing deep sorrow through leisure. But there are too many vulgar people in the world, and there has been much criticism from the outside. I can listen to it, but I only blame myself for not publishing this poem, placing it before the eyes of boors and fools. Changju and Jieni were passionate people in the world. The Ming people had some sayings...</p>
<p>The so-called saying of the Ming people comes from Xu Fang's reply to Fu Yingbin's letter, which is recorded here:</p>
<p>I am inherently shallow and narrow-minded, and I am also ignorant and unenlightened about the affairs of the current world. I have always been garrulous and loquacious, not daring to claim that I am lonely and radical, but also because in the battle within the same room, righteousness dictates that I cannot sit idly by. In the end, what good does a hair's breadth do? It only adds another crime. To strangle a jackal's throat and snatch its food, the thought is urgent, but those with knowledge will laugh at its foolishness. It has always been like this. Not just today. Moreover, Chu Kuang and Jieni are the coldest people in the Spring and Autumn period. However, tasting their words, they are not the cold people of the world, but precisely the hot people of the world. It is extremely hot, and there is nothing to be done, so one has to return to coldness. Extreme heat must be extreme cold. This is why one sighs on a raft. I have always been most opposed to the theory that pure talk destroyed the Jin Dynasty. The fall of the Jin was not due to Ruan Ji's licentiousness, but to the environment in which昏君 and tyrannical rulers killed people like hemp, forcing Ruan Ji to be licentious. In the past, China had no civil rights, and outspoken scholars often died at the hands of eunuchs. The party imprisonment of the Han Dynasty and the Qing debates of the Ming Dynasty are all examples of this. Later historians often say that pure talk destroyed the country, which is no different from exonerating the rebellious eunuchs. It is crude and also unjust. Drinking and being licentious, or being silent and unknown, is only being clean and self-respecting. Today's lepers want those who are clean and self-respecting to bear the crime of destroying the country. If so, then those who are "today united like crows, tomorrow scattered like crows, today surrendering, tomorrow leaning on the carriage bar, today gentlemen, tomorrow villains, today villains, tomorrow back to gentlemen" can be blameless. Even Confucius, a sage, sighed about floating on the sea on a raft. Today's lepers, with a face full of Confucian indignation, almost want to surpass the sage.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Wan Sheng <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Cao Ming</p>
<p>Wan Sheng, one of my cousins, has round and sparkling black eyes and plump cheeks that often show two dimples. This face, which is both gentle and lively, yet also strong and resilient, constantly endures her wretched circumstances: the vapor machines in the silk factory that broil the blood of the female workers; a father addicted to alcohol who wastes away her youth, and a gambling-crazed brother.</p>
<p>In our village, women occupy the main position in terms of production. Apart from managing silk, cocoons, planting mulberry trees, and working as clerks, the men either idle around or go to the cities. As for the women, their fate is decided from birth: their vitality is either worn down in the silk factory or consumed in the mulberry fields. Our Wan Sheng is similarly tormented by fate; on the one hand, she fully embodies the characteristics of these independent Shunde women—naturally, not every Shunde woman is like this—people who have been close to Shunde women will surely find her courage in her gentleness, and her decisiveness in her liveliness.</p>
<p>When Wan Sheng was twenty-seven or eight years old, I was only half her age. Because my family had said that in another year or two, they would ask me to apprentice with her, I slowly began to pay attention to her.</p>
<p>In the summer, around seven o'clock in the afternoon, Wan Sheng could be found on the highest stone step of a ferry in Dongxi River. She listlessly held her rice bowl, chewing without energy, allowing her weak figure to be reflected on the yellow and turbid river water. Sometimes, she would put down her chopsticks, walk down the stone steps, soak her feet in the water, and stare at the surface of the river with eyes that were both tired and worried.</p>
<p>"I'm going to be your apprentice in the future. Are you happy?" One day, I sat next to her on the stone steps of the ferry and said to her.</p>
<p>"You? Well, I advise you not to enter the silk factory!" She said decisively. "You should change your profession as soon as possible. What good is there in a silk factory? -- It's simply a furnace -- Just think of bones as branches. When the branches are baked dry by the fire and the sap turns into charcoal, they will break with a single knock. Really, we don't dare to use any force when we turn over at night!" She swallowed a mouthful of rice, forcefully made me eat a piece of pork, and continued, "We work hard until late, not to mention the benefits, eating enough and wearing coarse linen clothes is already considered good, but it's impossible! Well, the women here... We've never done anything wrong, and I don't believe in things like committing crimes in a previous life... Jiu Mei, you're young, you don't understand much." I loved listening to her words, which had a bit of the sour and astringent taste of unripe green plums. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>(I) Sound</p>
<p>These past few years, having lived outside for a long time, returning occasionally, I feel a sense of alienation from everything in my hometown. My heart always feels incomplete, as if it's not as intimate as it's stored in my memory. Sometimes, when I think about it, I feel that the seasons are still the same, the scenery is still the same, and nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Like a swallow that has changed its nest, lost, lost.</p>
<p>The Jiaochuan River still flows, and the years flow by in the same way, but the classmates of my youth have all been taken to the cities by the conditions of survival. Here, only some old, young, and female people are left, wealthy local tyrants and gentry, and poor wretches who have no money to go out. With these people, the air here is always only dull. On the one hand, there is exploitation and enjoyment, and on the other hand, there is the so-called "making a living by chewing on bitter juice."</p>
<p>Exerting all one's strength to practice extreme suppression, and exerting all one's strength to endure extreme suppression, forms this silent village.</p>
<p>The countryside is truly "silent." If there is any sound, it is the sound of firecrackers at the Lunar New Year, but after this period, one no longer hears it. Now, perhaps only the elderly have a weak lament for the ways of the world and the human heart! But what kind of sound does this make?</p>
<p>The children grow up year by year, batch after batch running to the cities. The countryside can only remain a longing in their minds forever. Those who remain are mostly under the age of ten. But children under the age of ten will still grow up and still run to the cities.</p>
<p>After how much longer, the countryside will probably become an area without strong men! Even women, many go to the bustling cities to work or as helpers, but most of them still remain here.</p>
<p>The lamentations of the elderly have never had a progressive effect on this village. The women do not even have a lament. They only know how to find a way to ensure that they are warm and full for this one day. When they can't be warm and full, they say that they were born with this bitter fate.</p>
<p>The women in our area do not do the work in the fields; at most, they only grow some vegetables. Therefore, apart from the money that the men can send back from the cities, the women's ways of making a living are only to work as seamstresses, sell vegetables, or raise a few chickens to sell eggs. During the day, they are not satisfied, and they look for some indoor work at night. Even after midnight, when even the sound of dogs is silent, one can still often hear the "swishing" sound of spinning yarn.</p>
<p>This must be the only sound that replaces their mouths!</p>

<p>— Yang Sheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, the west wind blew yellow sand, opening the curtain and seeing her; Narrow waist and tiny feet, pink face like peach blossoms. Selling acres of fields,</p>
<p>Pawning a car; Marrying the dear enemy home early, So I don't have to worry about both sides, So you don't have to worry about both sides!</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Father and Li Gu turned around, ready to leave. My younger sister was still grumbling, "I want to go too..." But they left without looking back. Li Gu was still smiling and saying something to Father, and Father nodded. In the child's heart, this was really too sad. Why wouldn't Father agree? Moreover, they blamed Li Gu for their complaints about Father. If she had said a word, he might have agreed, but Li Gu didn't say a word. The sadness made the older brother cry, and then the younger sister also cried. He complained a lot about Father. He had said before that he would play with them for two days, but he was only playing for one day. Dad was really not a good dad. He was so happy to go with Li Gu, but why wouldn't he take them? Li Gu would only smile and wouldn't say a kind word. If it were Mom, she would definitely take them! Dad also said that Li Gu would love them... The more he thought about it, the more pitiful he felt, and the more tears he shed. The younger sister cried and shouted:</p>
<p>"Brother, Dad won't take us, we won't go to school tomorrow, we'll ask Lu Ma to take us to play!"</p>
<p>The older brother was still crying and didn't answer his younger sister's words. It took a lot of effort from Lu Ma and Wang Ma to coax him inside. "I want Mom!" He stopped crying and stomped his feet, saying. He looked at the mother's photo and cried again.</p>
<p>At bedtime, the younger sister pouted and said:</p>
<p>"Brother, Li Gu won't take us, I don't like her."</p>
<p>The older brother looked at her and said:</p>
<p>"Li Gu doesn't love us!"</p>
<p>The children were all asleep. In his sleep, the older brother saw his mother holding his younger sister. His mother was telling her fairy tales, and his younger sister was leaning in his mother's arms, swaying gently. He was playing with a rubber ball alone, and his mother called out to him, "Ming, your ball is so dirty, come and listen to Mom's story!" So he stopped and listened for a while. His mother smiled and swayed, constantly telling the story. Suddenly, his younger sister interrupted his mother's story and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, what snacks are we eating?"</p>
<p>"Ah, Mom didn't make any today, be a good girl and listen to the story!"</p>
<p>"I want some!" The younger sister's little hand gently stroked Mom's face.</p>
<p>So Mom took out many beautiful soft candies and biscuits from the drawer and distributed them to them. But when he turned around, Mom was gone, so he shouted loudly for Mom and looked everywhere. It seemed that Mom was answering him and hugging him, but when he opened his eyes, it was Dad who was hugging him! "Wake up, Ming, don't cry, Dad is hugging you!"</p>
<p>But when the child heard his words, he cried even more fiercely.</p>
<p>"Mom is gone, I want Mom!" he shouted.</p>
<p>"Dad is here, don't cry!" Father said, and a tear fell on the child's cheek.</p>
<p>"Mom is gone!" The child lay on his father's shoulder, sobbing sadly. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e242">Record High Gold Bullion Prices - Gold Price Surges Past 1,000 Yuan - Resulting in a Frenzied Increase of 22.9 Yuan - US President Rejects Silver Legislation; Silver Market Experiencing Fierce Short Squeeze - Rumors of Japanese Government Purchasing Pure Gold; City-Wide Short Covering Intensifies <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The gold market, fueled by the collapse of silver prices, strengthened its upward trend and yesterday surpassed the 1,000 yuan mark. The US President continues to firmly reject any silver legislation that involves quantitative easing. The US silver market experienced a fierce short squeeze. The local gold market is undergoing short covering, with small-scale downward reactions occurring over consecutive days. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw a sharp decline across the board, with futures silver prices on the London and New York exchanges plummeting by 175 to 210 British pounds per troy ounce. Exchange rates were flat, with London gold rising by 3 1/2 pence. US wheat fell by 3.75, US cotton by 31 pounds, and the wool market opened with a surge to 96-97 yuan. This price didn't hold, and it continued to rise. Although the banks' appetite was flat after the opening, the gold market remained stable. News that HSBC would lower its listing price by 0.25 British pence and 0.5 yuan for US dollars, coupled with a Reuters report that the US Treasury Secretary had compiled a list of speculators in silver and sent it to the Senate, pushed the price past the 1,000 yuan mark. Although there was a pullback after that, the confidence remained firm. Except for the Guangdong banks, the short squeeze was still fierce, and the market situation showed a trend that was difficult to fall and easy to rise. The banks' appetite shifted to accepting foreign exchange, and the market tightened. Before noon, a Reuters report that the Japanese government had purchased pure gold today further boosted confidence, and gold prices rose even more. Trading was active in the market, with more than 70,000 transactions in half a day. The price of red gold was 1,012 yuan, and the spread continued to narrow to 2.5 yuan. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price this morning was 996.7 yuan, up 13.6 yuan from the previous closing price. The opening price of goods was the same. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices: British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 0.625; US exchange at 33.5 yuan. Wing Fung Heng, Fu On, Heng Hing, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Hing Yuan, Fu Yu, and others immediately entered the market. Although Qian Chang Xiang and Ding Kang sold, the price still rose to 9 yuan. Da De Cheng and Sheng Da sold bars, and the US dollar for August was reduced from 8.125 to 7.1 yuan. News came that HSBC would lower its listing price by 0.25 British pence and 0.5 yuan for US dollars. Heng Hing, Bing Hing, Fu Hing Yong, Yu Qing Yong, Yi Da Yong, Da De Cheng, Heng Hing Yuan, Yuan Sheng Yong, She Chang, and others scrambled to buy Yokohama Specie Bank. Macaulay ate up US dollars for September at 8.75, pushing the price past the 1,000 yuan mark to 1,010 yuan. Although Yuan Chun and others once sold within the 1,000 yuan range, Macaulay again bought US dollars for September at 8.125, and Fu Chang, Heng Tai, the Dalian banks, Yi Da Yong, Yu Qing Yong, Yuan Chun, Da De Cheng, Qian Chang Xiang, Zheng Chang, and others rushed in to 1,004.8 yuan. The market situation was unstable, and as soon as the goods were sold, the scattered shorts gave up their positions, and the price fell to 2 yuan in an instant. Mitsui also sold US dollars for June at 3.75. Yokohama Specie Bank bought US dollars for August at 0.5 yuan. Hua Bi and Korea ate up 0.625 for August. Zheng Chang, Yuan Chun, Yuan Mao Yong, Qing Fa Yong, and others again advanced to 4.7 yuan. Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Tong Yi, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Xing, and others supplied bars one after another, and the price fell to within 2 yuan. At this time, Zhi Feng Yong and Fu Chang took advantage of the low price to take in bars, while Heng Xing and Sheng Da sold, struggling around 2 yuan. However, confidence was high, and it was easy to rise and difficult to fall. As soon as Heng Yu, Yong De, Yi Da Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, and Yong Feng entered the market, the price rose immediately, rising to 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Goods, Heng Xing, Wing Fung Heng, and Sheng Da supplied bars again, falling to 3.7 yuan. However, because Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Yong Feng, Yuan Feng Yong, Heng Tai, Qing Fa Yong, and Yi Da Yong had a strong appetite to buy, the price rose to 1,007 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 1,006 yuan, with goods trading at 7 yuan. After the close, goods, Wan Xing, Yi Da Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, and others supplied bars one after another, eventually adding up to more than 8 yuan. The highest price during the half-day was 1,007 yuan, and the lowest price was 997 yuan, a difference of 10.3 yuan. As a result, it rose 22.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was set with HSBC's US dollar listing price falling by 0.5 yuan to 33 yuan. The gold bullion prices were 1,048 yuan with change. According to the closing price, the premium was approximately 42 yuan, less than the 7 yuan premium from the previous close. The registration price for May was 1,009 yuan, and for June, 1,006 yuan. The morning supplement was 1,009 yuan. The price of red gold was 1,012 yuan. The price of refined red gold was slightly sluggish due to the rise in gold bullion. In the market, the Tianjin banks sold 350 taels to Da De Cheng, with a premium of 14.5 yuan. 3,000 taels of East goods arrived, with a premium of 13 yuan. Finally, Wing Fung Heng sold more than 300 taels to the Tianjin banks, with a premium of 15 yuan. The spread was only 2.5 yuan, with Rui Kang paying Da Fung Heng 35 taels. Then he paid Da De Cheng 35 taels at the same price. Although there were rumors that the Central Bank would open spot, it was actually difficult to complete the transaction. The Central Bank's buying price had to be flat, while the industry needed a premium of 4 yuan, making it difficult for both parties to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely active. Zhi Feng Yong, Yang Da Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu, Heng Chang Yong, Da De Cheng, Chang Sheng Yong, Bing Hing, Yi Cheng, Heng Tai, Zhao Feng Chang, Fu Yu, Cheng Kang Yong, Yong De, Shen Kang, and others were on the buying side. Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yi Feng Yong, Hui Xiang, Tong Chun, Yuan Chun, Fu Tai Heng, Sheng Da, and Qian Chang Xiang were on the selling side. Wing Fung, Heng Yu, Qing Yong, Xie Xing Yong, and Da Fa Yong advanced and exited. Qing Fa Yong and Yong Feng exited and re-entered. The Dalian banks and Wan Xing together made about 2,900, covering about 800 taels. Shun Li made more than 2,900 together, covering about 400 taels. The Guangdong banks and Heng Xing traded 700 taels in and out, with slightly more going in. Sheng Da entered less than 100 taels and exited more than 800 taels. The total number of transactions on that day reached 79,450 taels.</p>
<p>Regarding the May contracts that had not yet been settled, the bulls Qian Chang Xiang still held about 4,300, Yuan Yi more than 2,900, Qing Fa Yong less than 900, Tong Chun a weak 300, Shen Kang more than 100, for a total of nine bullish parties. The bears included Tong Feng Heng and Wing Fung Heng with more than 2,100 taels each, Da De Cheng with more than 1,100 taels, Heng Xing with more than 800, Da Fung, and Heng Yu with more than 500 each, Ding Tai with just over 300, 　 more than 200, Hui Xiang, Xiang Feng, and Ding Chang with more than 100 each, for a total of twenty bearish parties. Up to today, there were still 8,680 taels remaining.</p>
<p>Looking at the June contracts, the buyers included Tong Feng Heng with just under 4,300, Wan Xing with just over 2,300, Fu Chang and Shun Li with just over 2,000 each, Run Chang Yu with just over 1,900, Yi Feng Yong with just under 1,500, Qing Fa Yong with just over 1,600, Zhi Feng Yong, Wing Fung Heng, and Shun Mao with more than 1,200 each, Da Xing Yong with just over 1,100, Ding Kang and Heng Xing Yuan with over 1,000 each, Shen Yu Yi Cheng and Heng Yu with over 700 each, Hong Xing Yong Fu An, and Run Chang Yong with more than 600 taels each, Da Shun and Fu Yu with more than 500 each.

As of today, the total number of chips has increased to 31,955 taels.</p>

<p>Great Comparison Period Day</p>
<h3 id="e244">Few Long-Term Deliveries -- Foreign Call Loan Rate Returns to Three Percent -- <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Great Comparison Period Day before the end of the fourth period. Long-term deliveries only amounted to 3.89 million from the money shops, still very few. The loan call loan rate was, due to operational relationships, a result of everyone racking their brains and using various means, still kept strictly secret and unwilling to reveal any information. Being in today's situation, on the one hand, there was a desire to ensure the safety of released loans and carefully select borrowers, while on the other hand, there was the distress of not being able to avoid lending for the sake of the business itself. This created a hesitant situation with many fears. The foreign call loan market was at 3 percent for both the morning and afternoon sessions, a slight decrease of .2 percent compared to yesterday. Watered down and meaningless head clearing continued, further weakening market sentiment. The volume of call loan note transactions was over 5.1 million for the morning session and 400,000 for the afternoon session. Transactions within the Small General Association amounted to over 500,000. Foreign call loan transactions, including withdrawals and new deals, amounted to over 2.9 million. Bank settlements: foreign banks settled over 3.3 million in note payments, over 7.6 million in various merchandise exchange collateral miscellaneous payments, over 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlements, 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 800,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks settled over 4.6 million in note payments, over 7.3 million in various merchandise exchange collateral miscellaneous payments, over 1.1 million in customs duties, and 500,000 in warehouse deposits. Japanese banks settled over 3.1 million in note payments, over 5.8 million in various merchandise exchange collateral miscellaneous payments, over 1.5 million in exchange settlements, and 600,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Money shops' foreign public bills settled over 51 million, foreign head clearing payments settled over 11 million, various route remittances amounted to over 600,000, cash receipts were 900,000, currency note withdrawals and issuances amounted to over 2.2 million, Anlu sources were 200,000, and going to the stomach was 500,000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total exchange amount at the city's note exchange house was 7,775,731.28 yuan, including 3,893,635.4 yuan in silver dollars and 3,882,095.88 yuan in exchange drafts in silver dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small silver dollars were at 840 yuan for both morning and afternoon sessions, a slight decrease of 5 yuan from the previous day.

Guangdong small silver dollars were at 745 yuan for the morning session, an improvement of 4 corners from the previous day. The afternoon session continued to rise by 6 corners, reaching 745.6 yuan, resulting in a recovery of 1 yuan from the previous day. The volume of transactions was 80,000 corners in the morning session and 65,000 corners in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained unchanged, at 3216.500 cash for both morning and afternoon sessions, with a transaction volume of 31,997 units, with a value of 980 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only traded the May futures contract. The April futures contract was left for settlement on the 27th. The market initially continued the upward momentum from the afternoon of the previous day, but then gradually declined due to large-scale selling by major players. The increasingly serious international situation, resembling an impending storm, discouraged bullish sentiment. The morning opening saw scattered buying, which was quite enthusiastic. The Disbandment Bonds showed stronger gains, and despite heavy selling of the No. 44 bond, the pressure was not enough to lower prices, with most continuing to rise by 2-3 corners. After that, each board showed weakness and listlessness. The Nos. 35.53 and 16 bonds, etc., saw extremely heavy selling, and there were very few buyers. Sentiment seemed to have turned negative. Today, only the May contract will be traded. The June futures contract must wait until the 28th to begin trading. The market price trend seems to be weakening, but the decline is not expected to be drastic. In general, it is feared that there will be large-scale fluctuations for the time being. Market prices ended with a uniform decline of 1-2 to 5-6 corners. The total turnover was 6.54 million yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot goods and 6,535,000 yuan in futures. The results of the price changes are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a market report from the New Fung Foreign Firm citing the Wall Street Journal, the New York Stock Exchange plummeted as the general view was that the currency inflation plan was likely to be shelved, silver prices plunged by 2 cents, most commodities weakened, and the market also fell sharply. A reaction occurred before the close, with a slight recovery. Forward silver was weak throughout the day. Later, due to the announcement of the list of those holding silver, speculators believed that this was a sign of the government's attack on legislation in the current Congress and tended to close out their positions, intensifying the fall in silver prices. The small exchange also fell. Bonds were mixed, but American and high-grade bonds were particularly strong. Furthermore, a report from the agency stated that (securities) traders were waiting for news to develop, and the market fluctuated meaninglessly. (Wheat) Although the basic position of wheat favored the bulls, it did not improve because those hoping for expansion were disappointed and sold. (Cotton) The market was low due to selling of the May contract and the sharp fall in silver prices. According to the report, Congress intended to protect the President from mandatory silver legislation, and spot demand was sluggish. (Sugar) The market was stable, and the spot market continued to improve. (Rubber) The market was firm, with the industry as the main buyer, indicating that rubber was in the hands of powerful players. (Silver) The market plummeted as the bulls panicked and sold off, and loss-limiting transactions were triggered. Once the limit price was reached, automatic selling continued, further intensifying the decline. London silver prices were higher than New York, so large amounts of silver were transported there. The total daily turnover was 1.27 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market is gradually moving towards stability. Recently, sales of spot yarn in North and South China have been brisk, with approximately 20,000 bales being purchased. Some people have high expectations, and new selling has temporarily stopped. At the same time, cotton has also trended upwards, leading to greater stability in the yarn market. Forward marked yarn may see a price of around 178 yuan.</p>

<p>At the opening of the marked yarn pre-market, the market was stable. After two or three boards of auctions, prices rose again, with each month rising by 7-8 to 1 yuan. The afternoon situation remained buoyant, with each month rising another 2-4 corners. The total volume of transactions for the day was 23,600 bales. Sales included 900 bales from Tongfu, 800 bales from Chunji, 1,150 bales from Yuanda, 2,100 bales from Gengfeng, 750 bales from Changyu, 950 bales from Taichang, 850 bales from Tonghe, and 1,350 bales from Dachang.

<p>The cotton market is quite tight. Because the settlement price of the previous day was higher, bullish sentiment is stronger. There are rumors of a squeeze on the May contract. However, spot sales have not been particularly brisk. The Ningbo group is making large-scale redemptions, and the market is becoming more buoyant. However, the future situation is unlikely to be excessively bearish.</p>

<p>At the opening of the marked cotton pre-market, although American cotton fell, silver prices contracted, and the gold market rose, buying sentiment in the market was still strong.

<h3 id="e254">The Main Reason for the Sudden Boom in North China Sales: Some Prices Are Lower Than Japanese Yarn; High Cotton Prices Affect Chinese Factories Reducing Work and Shipping <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Since September 18th, the North China cotton yarn market has been completely occupied by Japanese yarn, leaving no room for Chinese yarn. This has caused a major blow to China's cotton industry. However, recently the sales of coarse yarn have suddenly boomed, and purchases by the Tianjin group have continued unabated because some yarn prices are lower than Japanese yarn (previously, Japanese yarn prices were on average 7-8 yuan lower than Chinese yarn) by 3 to 5 yuan. Therefore, adhering to the principle of choosing cheaper options, Chinese yarn has suddenly risen and become active. Furthermore, due to the impact of high cotton prices, Chinese factories in the area have reduced work and shipments. Statistics show that purchases of various yarns in the past few days have all been around 10,000 bales. However, detailed information, due to the particularly low selling prices, the factory is unwilling to announce publicly. Some news has been recorded: Shenxin Factory's 10-count coarse yarn, 3,000 bales; Yong'an Factory's 10-count Jincheng, 1,000 bales, priced at 151 yuan; 10-count Jiahe, 1,500 bales, priced at 130 yuan; Puyi Factory's 16-count Diqiu, 1,500 bales, priced at 162 yuan; also 1,000 bales of 10-count coarse yarn. The recent trading prices of Chinese and Japanese yarn in the market are recorded below (for reference):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed, with possible delivery of heaven, bull closing, and poor spot market conditions leading to a decline. As a result, spot prices fell by 30 points, and futures fell by 20 to 31 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices remained unchanged, and futures rose. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to selling by European exporters, but later recovered due to buying by speculators. As a result, both Pingal and Omla rose by 2.5 corners, and Bairaoqi remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded below (24th telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed an initial flat and then brisk trend. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago continued to be lower by a small 2-3 corners, and Canada was lower by a small 1 corner. Therefore, when prices opened, the market atmosphere was slightly good. However, because the exchange announced that the market would, from today, empty one side of the margin and collect an additional 500 yuan, this situation seemed to be considered for the bulls, in order to maintain them. Therefore, fewer new shorts came out, and new longs slightly increased, so the market turned for the better. Until the afternoon opening, the current month showed a circling trend. The distant months, due to off-market hedging and market speculation, were gradually absorbed, so the market gradually returned briskly. The exchange also charged additional margins to the short side last year, and then immediately canceled them. It is unknown whether it can last. As a result, the current month rose by 1 point, May rose by 2.25 points, June rose by 2.5 points, July improved by 1.75 points, August rose by 2 points, and September rose by 2.25 points.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Near Wheat Down, Far Wheat Up <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed a trend of near decline and far stability for each month. Foreign wheat quotations continued to be lower by a small 1-2 corners, so market sentiment was naturally uneasy. However, at present, the highs and lows are temporarily distinguished between near and far. Because this month is the last day of trading, there is a lot of inventory on the market, and factories have no intention of receiving, so the bulls are under actual pressure and have to shout down. The distant months, although initially average, later turned brisk due to the flour market turning brisk and because off-market longs gradually increased. It is said to be related to those who hold up flour prices, so market sentiment has also improved slightly. However, the wheat market must recently look at the weather and the annual harvest, and it cannot be compared with the flour market situation. As a result, the current month fell another 5 points, and the closing price was miserably small at 3 yuan and 83 corners. June rose by 3 points, July rose by 5 points, and August rose by 3 points. Spot wheat has not opened because the factory's stomach has not moved.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Hsien rice from various places was small. The Ke group's appetite was very strong. However, for several consecutive days, the two major groups from Fuzhou and the mainland have been conducting business smoothly. The market price has gradually increased. The arrival is small, and the cargo owners have shouted loudly. The entering households claim greatly and are unwilling to yield. Therefore, the volume of transactions has decreased. Only the yarn market Hsien rice is being competed for by the Fuzhou group and the mainland. Yesterday, 1,500 bags were traded, and the price increased by another 5-6 points. The general market price opened at 5 yuan and 8 corners, and the next was 5 yuan and 7 corners. The prices of other various shaking machine rice and small twisted rice have all stabilized. A total of 3,296 bags of various rice were shipped out of the city, and were divided among this street, Fuzhou, and the mainland. If there are no smooth sales in the future, the market price may temporarily stabilize again.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Late Rice Arrival and Sales Are Equally Opposed <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources for various groups have slightly increased again, with nearly 50 numbers arriving (over 8,000 stones). Late rice accounts for about half, and the distribution situation is bleak. The Rong group's purchase appetite continues to be strong. For example, the North and South Ocean groups have been quite active since the beginning. The situation seems to feel stagnant, but later the arrival sources also surged. Therefore, although the sellers once shouted up the price, the customers' eating plate was difficult to loosen in the end. As a result, statistics show that the two groups jointly entered Qingjiao Songsi Xilian and other goods, over 3,000 bags. The market situation finally showed a stable situation. The arrival of Hou Geng from various groups was quite large, and the sales market was significantly inferior. The market situation was flat and colorless. The prices of Su Tong Nangang and other goods of the Chang group inevitably fell by 5 points. The price of Du Yang Jian was maintained by the continued rise of customer tips to stabilize it. Although the original change to the stomach did not show decline, the sources were too strong and were inevitably slightly affected, showing a slight softness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over forty numbers of goods arrived from various routes in Hexia. The sales appetite for various colors in the market, white stem sheep tip Du tip Port tip passenger tip slightly melted, change to the original early thin rice is average, Yin yuan goods are scarce and the sales are active, the market shape white stem high material is stable, Zhongguan price is reduced near the corner, and the second cargo is repaired for several minutes. The change in Yuan price is a small corner or so. The Du tip Port tip passenger tip thin rice price shape is fair, and the Yin Yuan price is lifted by 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>The soybean market price continued to rise yesterday by 3-4 cents or so. The price of goods from Zhongguan was fresher and more attractive than high-quality beans, so the sentiment was good. The distribution situation included factories trading 7-8 carts of Yingzhou beans, priced from 2 yuan and 62 cents to 56 cents, and also going to Dangshan beans for one cart, priced at 2 yuan and 60 cents. Local purchasing agents purchased 3 carts of large-grained Yingzhou beans, priced from 2 yuan and 65 cents to 63 cents, and also going to Feihe beans for two carts, priced at 2 yuan and 68 cents to 66 cents. Export groups purchased two carts of Zhengyangguan beans, priced from 2 yuan and 74 cents to 77 cents. The arrival source is still not surging, and is currently around 10 carts per day. There may not be much more in the future, so the future of the soybean market has a fairly stable foothold.</p>

<p>Early Spring Chill Affects Silkworm Ant Development. [Yuhang] The collection of early silkworm ants this season is uneven. Late silkworms are better. After the leaves opened, the weather was clear and warm, and silkworm development was smooth. Unexpectedly, after continuous spring rains, coupled with colder weather, the early gang of silkworms with three sleeps and vigorous leaves, due to unsuitable temperature and humidity, were found to have diseases such as not eating and not sleeping. The late silkworms' third sleep was also not working, and silkworm households are busy taking care of them. [Yuanjiachang] Farmers in the area are quite happy to raise ants this year. However, there are more people raising late silkworms. After collecting the ants, the weather was clear and warm, and the silkworms developed quite well. In the past two days, the spring cold was severe, and combined with the uncoordinated feeding of leaves after the rain, most of the early silkworms were stiff and unable to get up, and the late silkworms' appetite also decreased sharply. The instructors are currently adjusting the temperature, and the silkworm households have all set up fire basins in the silkworm room to increase warmth and remove humidity. [Shangyu] Farmers in the four villages all incubated the improved species distributed by the Improvement Association this year. The weather was clear and warm during the incubation period, and the collection of ants was quite uniform, and the development was also good. Most of the large gangs have already completed two sleeps and have sufficient leaves. Unexpectedly, it has been raining heavily for the past two days, and the weather has suddenly turned cold. The silkworms are delaying their sleep, and everyone is using firepower to get warm. [Haiyan] Silkworm households in various cities and villages have reduced the amount of feeding this year because they have learned from previous years' silkworm failures, and have discarded native silkworm species and did not raise them. They all hatched improved species, and the instructors helped to promote the green. The early gangs have been opening leaves for the first sleep for many days, and the late gangs have also tried the leaves. Fortunately, the instructors fed them with improved mulberry leaves, so although the weather is cold and rainy, the impact is still slight.</p>
<p>Waste Silk Transportation Methods Are Increasingly Sparse. Our country's yellow and white silk heads (collectively referred to as waste silk by the customs) have traditionally relied on French sales as the destination. In recent years, the impact of artificial silk and Japanese silk scraps (i.e., silk heads) has caused French sales to plummet. This time, the French mail ship Xue Xianghao exported only 89 packages of yellow and white silk heads jointly owned by Baili and others to Marseilles and other ports.</p>
<p>Factory Classics Only Have Spot Trading. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has gradually shrunk, and silk prices are looking good. However, the European and American markets currently have thick silk inventories, and the supply exceeds demand, so factory sales have not improved. Although Chinese silk has a higher pulling price due to the reduced exchange rate, the light factories in Shanghai have spot transactions, estimating that yesterday B had 20 but the price turned firm.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Upcoming Release of Zhuji Green Tea <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>In Zhuji, Xiaoshan, and other areas of Zhejiang Province, which are traditionally known for producing the earliest batches of green tea, the tea buds have been slow to develop due to the recent cold weather, barely showing their tips. According to people from the area, tea farmers in Zhuji are preparing to begin picking tea leaves immediately. However, buyers are showing little interest, so the price of the new tea is not expected to be high.</p>
<p>There are still 6,000 boxes of tea stored in Shanghai. New tea will soon be on the market. According to a recent survey, there are still over 6,100 boxes of tea stored in Shanghai, including 5,400 boxes of local "Zhen Mei," "Zhen Mei Needle," and "Xiu Mei" green teas, and only 700 boxes of imported green tea. The future trend of the tea market is most unfavorable for local teas.</p>
<h3 id="e263">News from Anhui Province on the Eve of Tea Harvesting <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Wuyuan green tea is considered the highest grade among foreign boxed teas. It is regarded as an unparalleled treasure in European and American markets. In recent years, while Russian sales of "Gong Xi" tea have declined, the demand for other varieties such as "Zhen Mei," "Chou Xin," "Feng Mei," "Xiu Mei," "Zhen Mei Needle," "Ma Zhu," "Gong Zhu," "Zhi Zhu," and "Xia Mu" teas has steadily increased in various European and American countries. Therefore, in the competition among foreign teas, Wuyuan tea's reputation remains unshakable. In recent years, affected by the global economic panic, sales have decreased compared to previous years, but prices are still higher than before the tenth year of the Republic [1921]. Last year, those who sold their tea early and quickly made a small profit, while those who held on to it suffered losses. This year, existing tea businesses, noting that the tea stored in Shanghai has been sold and that foreign demand remains strong, are continuing to operate. The demand for supplies such as crates, firewood, charcoal, lead strips, and paper has increased as tea businesses rush to prepare. As of now, except for tea businesses in the southwest villages bordering Jiangxi, which have been disrupted by local communist bandits and cannot open, about 200 tea businesses in the three northeastern towns are preparing to open. This has created a palpable sense of tension in the market.</p>
<p>Liuan and Huoshan are renowned tea-producing areas in western Anhui. Areas such as Mabuxi, Hujiadian, Qingshan, Maotanchang, Guanjia Du, Du Bo, Lianhua Shan, and Fenghuang Tai all produce excellent tea. The annual output is approximately 400,000 [units of measurement]. Local shops and businesses specialize in teas categorized by shape, such as "Mao Jian," "Xiang Pian," "Lian Xin," "Que She," "Gua Pian," "Que Zhen," "Mei Pian," "Kui Zhen," "Yu Zhen," "Yin Zhen," and "Feng Chi." The largest market is Shandong Province, followed by North China and other provinces. However, due to years of banditry, tea merchants have been hesitant to travel to the area, and sales have declined year by year. This spring's tea market is particularly sluggish. Stored tea sells for only three or four yuan per [unit of measurement], and those priced at five or six yuan are rarely inquired about. Business is 70-80% lower than in previous years. Tea farmers generally feel the hardship of having goods they cannot sell. With the spring rains, the new tea season is about to begin. The bandits near Qingshan and the Taojia River area have not yet been suppressed. The Huoshan County Magistrate, recognizing that the livelihoods of the local people depend entirely on tea, has, in conjunction with the Tea Industry Association, telegraphed the Chairman of Anhui Province, requesting the dispatch of troops to be stationed in the tea-producing areas to protect merchants conducting business and to aid the rural areas. At present, tea merchants from Shandong are gradually arriving, but not with the same enthusiasm as in the past. The prospects for this year's tea market are still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Sugar Market: White Sugar Rises with Customs Gold Unit <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tense due to the sharp rise in the Customs Gold Unit to 2042. Spot prices, such as No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar, rose by 20 cents to 20.02 yuan. No. 9 KNG red sugar was priced at 15.80 yuan, and local No. 1 refined white sugar was priced at 18.60 yuan, also up 10 cents, with transactions occurring. However, Swire Sugar's "B" mark, although quoted at 20.05 yuan, saw no transactions. Wholesalers offered over a hundred boxes of Beihai "Pian Qing" sugar from Guangdong at 9 yuan, and over a hundred packages of Longjiang "Qing" sugar from Chaozhou at 10.40 yuan. Several dozen packages of "Zhi Yang" sugar were offered at 15 yuan, and over eighty packages of "Tong Shou Hu Ru Fen" sugar were offered at 7.50 yuan. A Jianbang wholesaler offered sixty packages of No. 2 and 3 Guangbing sugar at the original price of 24 yuan, but buyers were uninterested, and no transaction occurred.</p>

<p>Since the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, metal prices have soared. Wholesale prices have reached 15.75 yuan per picul, an increase of 15 cents from the previous day, while retail prices have reached 16 yuan, an increase of over 30 cents. Tea merchants are very eager to purchase, resulting in transactions of two to three hundred bars.</p>

<h3 id="e266">National Crisis and National Self-Salvation <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Gu She</p>
<p>The nation is now at a critical juncture, a moment of imminent peril. Japan is manipulating China at will, and the tension of the international imperialist struggle in the Far East has reached an unprecedented peak. At this moment, China has truly become "meat on the chopping block, to be carved up at will." Fellow citizens! Do you also feel that we are facing an "imminent disaster"?</p>
<p>Looking back to the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident] and its aftermath, our national spirit was initially so tense. Anti-Japanese associations, volunteer armies, petitions, and demonstrations, almost everyone's blood was stirred, and they engaged in the national salvation movement. They ran around calling for help, with extreme enthusiasm. But now, there is silence. As the national crisis intensifies day by day, the people's passion for national salvation is declining day by day. What kind of phenomenon is this? This is a true sign of national demise! The national crisis is not as worrying as the people's decadence, which has reached such a degree that it is more than enough to lead to the country's downfall!</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, do not think that because we have been shouting about "national demise" and "national demise" for decades, and have been hearing about "joint administration" and "partition" for so long, but the country has not yet fallen, has not yet been "jointly administered," and has not yet been "partitioned," that we will still be able to get through this, no matter how severe the crisis is, so there is no need to rush. This is the biggest mistake, the most irreparable psychology of national demise! You must know that the reason why we have not been "partitioned" or "jointly administered" in the past, and the country has not nominally fallen, is not because we have the ability to survive on our own, but because they have not yet found it necessary to move from de facto partition and joint administration to de jure partition and joint administration. That is to say, they do not need to immediately implement de jure partition or joint administration. There is still a balance of power between them, and they can rely on this balance of power to peacefully and equally exploit China. But now, things are very different. The balance of power in the Far East has long been broken by Japan's September 18th actions. On the one hand, the intensification of the imperialist crisis has also forced them to intensify the division of colonies. By the end of the 19th century, the world's colonies had already been completely divided. After the World War of 1914-1918, there was a second allocation, and now the only country left is China. Although China has already been de facto allocated to various powers, it nominally maintains independence. Now, what they are discussing is how to move from de facto partition to de jure partition. Everyone simply divides a piece of land in China, marks it with the name of a certain country, and sends a governor-general to administer it. And Japan was the first to implement this plan. Following Japan's example, other countries will inevitably "follow suit." This has led to the recent fierce competition among the powers for China. The result of the struggle for China will naturally and easily lead to China's demise, from de facto to de jure, directly belonging to various countries. This is an inevitable path. You must know that this is the inevitable result of the development of imperialism to its final stage! As the imperialist crisis develops to its [missing word] point, the division of colonies becomes more [missing word], and this division [missing word] will not stop until the final fall of imperialist justice. Fellow citizens, should you all clearly recognize the deepening of this crisis?</p>
<p>As the struggle between imperialist powers intensifies day by day, the degree of China's partition also increases day by day. It is believed that in the near future, the magic hands of imperialism will extend to China and truly tear our map into pieces. Fellow citizens, do you all feel that the degree of this crisis has reached a terrible peak? Decadence and enjoyment cannot save our souls! Arise! Awaken early and work together to find a way to save ourselves!</p>
<h3 id="e267">Thorough Understanding of China <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>This can be considered a kind of glory. Our country has always only had students going abroad to study, but now Japan has sent children to study in our country. A Reuters dispatch from the 15th stated: "The East Asian Common Culture Association has selected ten young boys from Japan and sent them to study in China. These students are scheduled to depart from Tokyo Station at 10:00 AM on the 22nd of this month and travel to Kobe, where they will take a connecting ship to China on the 25th. The ages of these boys, including Inoue Shinichi, are all 14. Seven of them will go to Tianjin to study at the Sino-Japanese College, while the remaining three are scheduled to enter the Jianghan Middle School in Hankou. They also plan to take the entrance exams for Chinese universities in the future. They are scheduled to study for ten years, followed by six years of compulsory service, so that they can thoroughly understand China."</p>
<p>Sending students to study abroad is a very common thing and not worth making a fuss about. But the actions of the Japanese always have a bit of mystery, making it difficult to fathom their depths. For example, this time they want to send people to our country to study, but the purpose is not to seek knowledge, but to thoroughly understand China. Isn't there an intention here? Could it be that they are constantly clamoring for Sino-Japanese friendship, but they do not understand the situation in our country, and must wait for these ten handsome young boys selected from all over Japan to understand it after ten years? No, they have added the word "thoroughly" to their understanding. It turns out that they do understand China, but their understanding is not thorough enough. Therefore, this time they have specially sent these Japanese children to study, hoping that they will be able to thoroughly understand our country in the future. When I first heard this news, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of sadness and joy. The sad thing is that before Japan has thoroughly understood our country, we have already lost a huge piece of land. If they thoroughly understand it one day, I am afraid that our old and big China will not be able to be preserved. The happy thing is that perhaps the reason why Japan has always bullied our country is because they have not thoroughly understood our country. Fortunately, they will thoroughly understand it in the future, and will return the lost territory to us and truly treat us with the warmth of brothers. Fortunately, these ten young Japanese men are about to come to our country, and we may as well temporarily entrust the fate of our country to them!</p>
<p>Speaking of students studying abroad, it has stirred up many feelings in us. Doesn't our country also send batches of students to Europe, America, or Japan every year to study? And aren't there also many students who return from Europe, America, or Japan every year? But what they bring to us is something we really can't say. Among them, I don't know if there is anyone who can thoroughly understand foreign countries? Perhaps they always understand a lot, because students from our country have always had a common tendency. If he studied in the United States, after returning home, he would advocate pro-Americanism. If he studied in England or Japan, after returning home, he would advocate pro-British or pro-Japaneseism. If they didn't thoroughly understand, how could they advocate friendship with others? What's more, there are those who advocate national betrayal. Those traitors and flattering factions that have emerged in our country recently were all studying in Japan before. According to this reasoning, these few Japanese teenagers who have come to China to study with important missions [missing word] after returning from their studies, will probably not be [missing word] to our country [missing word]. We will wait [missing word]! We would like to express some welcome to them in advance!</p>

<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>Are you still in this world? It's been almost a year since we received your letter! At first, we suspected that you had been squeezed out of the bureau, because we were always worried that your small position would be difficult to maintain. And you once told me that even if your superiors were willing to accommodate you, that world of demons and monsters was not a place for you to settle down, and it would be better to go back to your hometown and eat sweet potatoes. But, people would definitely inform us if they left A Port and went elsewhere, but we have not yet received any news from you about this [missing word]. Or have you seen through that we are friends who are ungrateful and lack loyalty, not worthy of sharing hardships, so you angrily decided to break off relations with us? You are poor, how can we not know deeply. Having to treat a guest to three copper coins worth of peanuts, I once swallowed white rice mixed with tears in the dark! But after we fled, you should be able to imagine the difficult and arduous situation. Without you asking for help, we have tried our best several times to scrape together some money to send to you, but we are powerless to do so, and the regrets in our hearts are never remedied for the hunger in your stomachs! Oh, perhaps our speculation is wrong? Are you such a person?</p>
<p>Or are you truly unfortunate and have died? In the last letter you wrote to us, from the hasty and crooked handwriting and the intermittent and plaintive sentences, we know that your illness was unusually rapid and severe! What makes us feel infinitely shocked and sad is that there are still faint traces of your tears and bloodstains on the letter paper! After reading this bad news, we couldn't help but look at each other in dismay! What disease are you suffering from? The letter did not say clearly. What are the changes in the condition after recuperation? We know nothing about it. We can't wait to rush to the sickbed to comfort you! All we can do is quickly write letters, one letter, two letters, three letters, but the reply is always silent! Until today, whether you are alive or dead? We still can't understand! A weak body, how can it withstand the fierce attacks of vicious disease demons? No one could have expected that leaving in such a hurry without saying goodbye would indeed become a permanent farewell? More than ten months of heart-to-heart friendship has left us with endless pain! In the vast world, how many can be considered confidants? If you are dead, can death forget us? If you are dead, can you rest in peace? Aren't there still an old mother and young siblings in your family? Isn't there still a young wife whom you have been married to for a short time and shared the joys and sorrows with? Isn't there still a - no, he died long after he fell to the ground.

<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>He is my eldest sister's husband. I don't understand why I should think about him. That child also understands women's hearts too well. I think my eldest sister is very happy. Thinking, a black shadow rushed from the waist door again. Looking closely, it was my eldest sister. She was wearing a thin silk shirt, and her belly was slightly high in front. I wanted to laugh, but I couldn't laugh, as if I had done something hypocritical to her. I gently called out to my eldest sister, so low that it only rolled in my throat. My eldest sister sat beside me, stroking my arm and asked, "Are you sick?" I nodded, pretending to stand up reluctantly, and said, "The weather is not right. Mom is in the back." Then I took her hand and walked inside. My eldest sister kept calling out "Auntie" along the way. My mother came out of the kitchen with water dripping from her hands.</p>
<p>My eldest sister joked, "Auntie, my little sister is thinking of her brother-in-law. Look, her face is as red as a monkey's butt." I couldn't help but start to hit my elder sister, trying to tear her mouth. My mother came over to stop me and said, "Don't fight. Your elder sister is pregnant. If your brother-in-law finds out, he won't like it." Then I laughed, as if that lovely person was already standing in front of me.</p>
<p>After sitting down, my eldest sister said seriously, "Brother-in-law invites you to go to the movies." I glanced at my mother. She didn't seem to have heard [missing word] clearly, so I deliberately said that I wasn't comfortable today and didn't want to go. My eldest sister pursed her lips, "Is the little girl afraid of being seen by others?" I wanted to start hitting her again, but my mother said, "Your brother-in-law is kindly inviting you. Go ahead." It was clear that my mother had agreed. I still pretended to ask if my eldest sister was going. She pulled me and said as we walked, "Are you afraid your brother-in-law will eat you?"</p>
<p>When we arrived at my uncle and aunt's house, he was pacing back and forth in the hall. Today, he was wearing a new suit. The way his trouser legs swayed as he walked was quite stylish. When he saw us come in, his gaze shot at me, as if asking my eldest sister, "Is my sister going?" "My sister is afraid you'll eat her," my eldest sister's answer made everyone in the hall laugh.</p>
<p>After the movie, we ate dinner at a restaurant and returned to my uncle and aunt's house together. My eldest sister still escorted me back to my room. Whether it was on the tram, in the movie theater, or in the dining room, he was always carefully guarding against my eldest sister and me. He was guarding against my eldest sister, his wife. I felt that he had ulterior motives for being so attentive to me, because his eyes were always staring at me intensely after every move. Or maybe I'm just being too sensitive, but I hope my eldest sister doesn't notice these things.</p>
<p>Again, I have written so much. My mother often asks me what I am writing. Should I tell her? I have really changed recently.</p>
