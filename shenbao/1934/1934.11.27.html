<h3 id="c24">英美合作之前途 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>關於海縮問題。我人甚盼英美合作。前論已詳言之矣。頃據外電。英美當局之態度。亦已有此傾向。如英國保守黨領袖包爾温一方盼望美國之早入國聯。他方更主張英國海軍之行動。應以美國之態度爲轉移。言外之意。一若今日英國態度之游移不决。實受美國之影響也者。同時。英外部對於英日締結不侵條約之説。亦加正式否認。至華盛頓方面。則數日以來。對於此點。屢有表示。而國務卿赫爾對新聞記者之談話。尤爲明顯。據此以觀。則我人前此所切望之英美合作。至今已露其端倪。蓋日本若堅具廢約之决心。英美爲維持遠東均勢計。不能不出於合作之一途也。</p>
<p>一月以來。以英國態度之曖昧。乃使海縮會談之趨向。晦暗難明。唯至今日。則英美日三國對於海縮之態度。又復明顯。即日本之立塲。全在軍備平等。而英美之態度。則仍在維持華府海約也。英國前此態度曖昧。不遽表示顯然之主張。其意殆欲判明日美真正之意嚮。以爲確定自己方針之準備耳。今觀包爾温之言。即知美國對日。若真能不曲不撓。準備以武力維持海約者。則英國海軍。亦必與美國相合作。於此我人可以判斷。英人曩昔對日之態度。大抵屬於「虚與委蛇」之性質。並非真有所愛於日本也。</p>
<p>今英美之態度。既已逐漸明瞭。往後之發展。自不外二途而已。（一）則日本屈服而讓歩。（二）則日本不甘屈服而堅决反抗英美之壓廹。據昨日東電觀察。日本之廢除華府海約。並不以英美之合力反對而稍變。是其所採之方針。已甚明顯。易詞以言。即日本對於英美之合力壓廹。固已準備抵抗矣。</p>
<p>海縮談判之情勢發展如此。國人應加注意者。有數事焉。（一）爲英美合作對於我國之意義。（二）爲英美實力壓廹日本之時間問題。（三）爲我國之預備。國人對於英美合作。有認爲極好消息者。以爲如此則日本對我之一切侵略行動。皆可由此糾正。亦有以爲英美之合作。純爲謀自己之利益。日如一旦屈伏。英美對我之壓廹。未必有異於日者。此二態度。似皆過當。前者期望過奢。後者悲觀太甚。實則英美果能合作。以實力壓廹日本。無論如何。至少可以稍戢軍國主義之野心。而英美自身亦有其矛盾對立之點。頗難處處一致也。</p>
<p>至於實力壓廹日本之時間。與我今後之準備。亦有密切之關係。以勢推測。至少亦須五年之久。其故有可得而言者。（一）則歐洲之糾紛。自馬賽慘案而後。又日臻於複雜。欲求歐局之底定。决非短期聞內所能奏效。歐局不定。則英之海軍。不能放膽東移。策應美國之艦隊。（二）則英之新加坡軍港。須於一九三八年底工竣。（三）則美之文生氏海軍建造計劃。亦須於一九三九年完成。（四）則日本於宣告廢約之後。亦必竭力造艦。以應來日之事變。故短期間內。英人過問遠東事件之實力。尚有牽制。而美之海軍。亦有待於擴充。此皆形勢之顯然可見者也。</p>
<p>英美對日之實力壓廹。不能立即實現。</p>
<p>已如上述。而我人對此一事變之來臨。則必當有所準備。國於大地。必先有其自存之道。而後始足言夫外交局勢之利用。故今日之國防。當出全力布置之。至於國際間之援助。猶在其次耳。</p>

<p>［倫敦］今晨美總代表台維斯與日大使松平會議之際、曾討論日本廢止華盛頓海軍條約後舉行海軍談也舌所取之可能的手續、今晨之會議、乃兩國總代表第一次所開非正式之討論、現料日本將於十二月十日宣布廢止華盛頓條約、數方面現覺該約之廢止、結果將使海軍談話告終、聞兩代表今晨會談時、並未提及政治問題、因松平表明日本所答覆兩星期前英國所提出之問題、尚未完備也、此項問題涉及海軍質的限制、太平洋中屬地不築防禦工程、造艦程序應相互照會、據松平宣稱、太平洋中屬地不築防禦工程一節、渠仍候政府之訓令、松平正式確告台維斯、外傳日本向英國提出海軍五·四·四比率之説、實無根據倫敦人士現覺如海軍談話一旦轉入政治方面、則必將向日本詢問中國土地完整及開放門户二事、惟此項質問、非待松平表明新訓令所示以之方針後、不致提出、星期四日康特公爵將與環麗娜郡主結婚、星期三日國會將辯論國家防務、故在星期五日以前海軍代表不致續開談話（二十六日路軍電）</p>

<h3 id="c95">日本臨時議會的展望 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>政民兩黨會同作戰</p>
<p>預算編成屢受挫折</p>
<p>立憲政治的國家、對於議會當然特别注重、因爲議會是民意的代表機關、督促政府、作種種人民所要求的工作、日本最近的議會、固然還是惟一的立法機關、但事實上、多數民衆好像並不很熱烈的要求他、即專門作政治的生活的政黨、也没有什麽表現、足以代表民衆、反之、民衆對於政黨、去很冷淡、似乎覺得關係並不密切、也不希望議會裏能解决他們的問題、政黨的萎靡不振、更是不可掩飾的事實了、</p>
<p>民政黨是現政府的與黨、可是岡田內閣成立以來、除對外政策是踏襲着從前政策、没有變化、不受國民批評以外、其餘也是無所短長、一般輿論亦少有好感、所以民政黨雖然算是與政府一致、照理該擁護政府的主張、然而最近岡田內閣的微温態度、對增加租税一案、更惹起不少的反感、即民政黨內不平的聲浪、也到處可聞、最顯著的象徵、就是政民兩黨的聯合運動、</p>
<p>政民兩黨提携工作、原不自今日始、五一五犬養被刺事件發生、議會政治動摇以來、每當政治季節、就有人高倡政黨提携運動、或舉國一黨論、但是都没有什麽效果、何况議會之中、政友會差不多有三百個議員、在衆院四百六十六席中占絶對多數、就將民政黨加上、也未必有用、</p>
<p>這一次兩黨提携動、所以比較上有力的原因、一則是受在「滿」機關組織改革的影響、再則是受軍部發行那本國防本義小册子的刺激、因爲生「滿」機關、原來是文治派和武人共治的、換一句話、是資本家、是相當有力的管理人、可是近年以來、他們對「滿」投資、已不很安心、甚至有的人不願再投新資本下去、怕將來掌握不住、又恐怕安全不充分、但那裏究竟有開發的餘地、應該把過剩資本投下去、不過像現在、把政治上一切權力都轉到軍部手中、他們就早覺着不妥當了、軍部發行小册子的問題、在貴族院和衆議院中、都有相當的反感、無如懾於軍部的威力、勢不敢發、假如政民兩黨真能聯合一致、或者更容易應付亦未可知、並且民政黨方面、若槻禮次郎既辭去總裁、黨首一時無人、提携運動自然感覺必要、政友會中鈴木喜三郎對兩黨聯合、並不十分熱心、可是一方面有久原房之助的「一國一黨論」他方面又有山本條太郎「擁護立憲政治説」、而床次入閣之後、該黨在統制上又發生問題、所以鈴木不能不容納政民兩黨聯合的提議、然而聯合能到什麽程度、是否能舉黨一致與現政府搏戰、還是疑問、因爲擁護憲政、到底是一句抽象的空話、並不能提起聯合的精神、除非對岡田內閣下總攻擊、在倒閣運動中取聯合、方纔可能、鈴木以純在野黨的首領、固然贊成此舉、久原一派也大體同意、不過他有擁宇垣一成作該黨總裁、或擁護南次郎大將爲內閣總理的意圖、山本（條太郎）似乎還不很贊成積極倒閣、民政黨雖也傾向於倒閣運動、但是没有立即呌該黨出身的閣員退出內閣的决心、祗是在改革問題上繞圈子、是則聯合運動、對於實際問題、非但不能聯合、而且還有分立之虞、</p>
<p>現內閣本身的力量、原來是由軍部·官僚·政黨·三者凑合而成的、根本難於一致、我們看新增預算問題的爭執、軍部的主張、自然蓋過一切、現在他雖然一再讓歩、恐怕結果軍費會占國庫支出總數的百分之四六、以至百分之五○、其他如救濟災害等、也相當增加、可是與國防費相比較、究竟是少數、事實上與金融家産業資本相接近的財長藤井、既不能不顧到財界現狀、又不能拂逆軍部的要求、結果倒閣的、恐怕將不是議會、而是內閣自身所包含的矛盾哩、（一九三四年十一月二十二日於東京）</p>

<p>俟省府通過再行在蕪湖正式簽訂</p>
<p>總額百廿萬三期解欵廿個月還淸</p>
<p>安徽省政府、以今歳災荒奇重、税入鋭减、行政費頓感困難、爰向中央等五銀行、接洽借欵一百二十萬元、以資應付、該項借欵、自經皖省財政廳長毛龍章來滬接洽後、業已完全商妥、並於上星期六（二十四日）簽訂草合同、由毛廳長於昨日下午、携帶返皖報告、候省府會議通過後、即在蕪湖與各承借銀行分行正式簽訂、兹將新新社記者探悉各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>洽商經過</p>
<p>皖省府此次曾呈准中央發行二十三年地方庫劵九十萬元、兹爲手續上便利起見、即將該項庫劵中止印發、一面在核准庫劵數額範圍內、由財政廳長毛龍章來滬、向中央等五銀行借欵八十萬元、並連同先前與該五銀行商妥、彌補該省預算不足之借欵四十萬元、總計一百二十萬元、以資應付行政費之用、即以財政部補助該省之全部鹽餘作爲擔保基金、經毛廳長來滬、連日與承借銀行一再接洽磋商結果、始於上星期六完全商妥、並在借欵草合同簽字、</p>
<p>簽訂合同</p>
<p>該項借欵接洽就緒後、毛廳長即於上星期六下午三時、在中央銀行三樓、邀集各承借銀行、作最後之决定、並將合同草案、逐條加以修正後、即由各銀行代表在該草合同上簽字、簽字代表、計爲中央銀行滬行副經理周邦新·中國銀行滬行副經理程慕灝·交通銀行滬行經理張佩紳·中國實業銀行總經理劉晦之·上海銀行總行副經理鄒秉文代表·暨皖財政廳長毛龍章等六人、并悉五銀行已於昨日將該草合同郵寄蕪湖分行、俟皖省府通過後、再行正式簽字、</p>

<p>用途係爲撥付經常國庫支出費用</p>
<p>以九二解欵由建設銀公司等承購</p>
<p>抵押借欵説係誤傳</p>
<p>申時社云、財政部爲輔助國庫支出、近特將該部最近發行之捲菸印花税票三千萬元、躉售於中國建設銀公司·及本埠各銀行·分十二期付淸、申時社記者、昨晚往謁孔氏、當蒙告知該欵項用途、及接洽經過、兹特分誌如下、</p>
<p>孔財長談</p>
<p>據孔氏云、近外傳財政部將紙烟印花税、向滬銀行界抵押三千萬元云云、此確係事實、惟非爲「抵押」性質、係財政部允准將新近發行之捲烟印花税三千萬元、全部躉售於中國建設銀公司、再由該公司向股東各銀行推銷承購、現已由財政部與建設銀公司完全商妥、由該公司直接向財部負責繳解現欵、</p>
<p>鉅欵用途</p>
<p>至財部方面對此項現欵、仍係發補經常國庫支出、並無特殊用途、故躉售紙烟印花三千萬、不過財部冀得稍提關應用現欵、並非爲借欵性質、現建設銀公司本身决承購全部三分之一、計一千萬元、餘二千萬元、由建設銀公司股東銀行分配承購、此蓋爲公司內部之事、並非財部向銀行抵押借欵、</p>
<p>九二付欵</p>
<p>又據孔氏續談、該項躉售方面、財部允以九二付欵、其中百分之八作爲承購者之利益、昨日報載九三計算係不確、並規定分十二期交欵、即自下月起、每月由銀公司方面負責向財部繳解、限一年內解淸、財部方面、則每月將紙烟印花税票三百萬元、交中央銀行、由中央銀行將税票售出後所得現欵、分别按期付送各承借方面云、</p>

<p>華東社記者昨晨向本埠全盛民信局探悉、自交通部限令全國民信局、在本年內一律結束後、全國各地民信局同業、以生計行將告絶、來日難以維持、均紛紛推派代表晋京、向中央請願呼籲、日前上海推派華雲錦·印元通·二人、會同寗波代表王文江·鄔韻玉、蘇州代表任士庭、紹興代表王同人等多人、自滬赴京、向中央黨部·行政院·交通部·等機關請願、無如交部取締民信局、已具决心、無法收回成命、故卒未得當局允許、代表等因無結果而返、</p>
<p>格於情勢準備結束</p>
<p>目下十一月份業將終了、轉瞬即屆限期、離年終爲時僅有一月、內地如漢口·杭州·長沙·南昌·濟南·徐州·寗波·蘇州·常州·松江·温州·鎭江·等地同業、已由當地警局、循該地郵局之請、勸令必須於年內結束、各該地民信局以已無轉圜餘地、故均已準備結束、</p>
<p>四局剴切勸令停業</p>
<p>本埠共有民信局五十四家、公共租界工部局·及市社會·公用·公安·等四局、准郵務管理局請求、並遵行政院訓令、昨晨均分别派令探捕及職員、在各該管區域內、逐一剴切勸令停業、現該業因格於情勢、已準備於年內結束、</p>
<p>善後問題殊感困難</p>
<p>惟民信局結束後善後問題、至感困難、蓋民信局創於前淸乾隆初葉、迄今已有百年歷史、慘淡經營、煞費苦心、始得民間信任、依此爲生者不下十萬人、是以百年來努力信用發展、並無盈餘、今定年內結束、全國民信局員工十萬人、將完全失業、發生勞資解僱問題、在資方既無餘資以給退職金、而勞方亦難於維持將來生計、故甚感嚴重云、</p>
<p>民信公所昨再集會</p>
<p>全國民信業代表、昨日下午、又在裏鹹瓜街民信業公所開緊急代表會、從四時起至六時始散會、出席代表華雲錦·印源通·王同文·任士庭·鄔韻玉·等三十餘人、當即推出代表、草擬呈文、並决定於本星期三或四、分向市政府·市黨部·社會局·郵政總局·等各有關係機關、分别請願、陳明困難情形、並悉該代表等擬於五中全會開會前、分數批晋京、先向各中委個别請求、然後於十二月十日、再齊集向會中請願、</p>
<p>失業員工適當工作</p>
<p>目下政府對此民信事業、雖亦承認係我國文化事業中之傳播者、但郵政事業、世界各國均係國家專營事業、致民信業盛行後、與郵政事業根本衝突、故祇得忍痛取締、對失業員工善後生計、確係絶大難題、據熟悉此業之半官方面語云、政府已用最大决心、勸令民信業停業、但對失業員工之適當工作、頗費躊躇、其實最適宜之安插法、不若將此大批員工、分赴邊疆郵局稀少之處、創設郵局、因民信業中不少刻苦耐勞之輩、且渠等亦粗通文字、若能如此相商、則對我國文化交通建設各端、均有裨益、而於十餘萬人生計、亦可解决矣云云、</p>

<p>船主决用國人</p>
<p>决不遷就港方</p>
<p>國營招商局第二艘新輪海亨號抵滬後、即進高昌廟海軍部江南造船所第三新船塢、昨晨十時、招商局船舶科長趙雲台等、會同承造之英國船廠駐滬代表馬爾康洋行工程師、赴高昌廟檢騐機器等、俟檢竣後、再由江南造船所髹漆、該局擬於二十九日接收、惟船主問題、因香港船政廳堅持、華人必須考試、否則並大副亦須用外籍人員充任、方可給發客牌、局方對此、認爲港政府歧視我國、如再遷就、不特影響我國主權與地位、將使我國航權、永無爭回之望、故已决定、寗犧牲香港搭客、决用本國人充當船長、而拒絶考試、</p>
<p>港廳堅持成見</p>
<p>招商局爲四海輪、請領香港客牌事、特派船舶科副主任周厚坤赴港、向船政廳接洽、海元輪因船主爲外籍人員、不生問題、已經領到、其他各輪、香港當局、仍堅持成見、如果船主用外國人則可塡發、設用中國人、則難以同意、至少須加試騐、經周主任一再力爭、以中國船主已有中國政府所給之證書、港政府不應再加考試、現周君已乘大來洋行麥金蘭總統輪返滬、謂港政府對於新輪客牌、必須船主大副輪機長三人、全用外人、始可給予、否則絶對不予同情、</p>
<p>局方决用國人</p>
<p>海亨船主及大二三副等全用華人充任、早在上星期四理事會通過、（已載本報）今據周主任由港返滬言及香港政府之主張、乃又續開理事會討論、當塲僉以此事關係國家地位、而港政府對我國過於難堪、且該輪船主已派定馬家駿、無論如何、不再變更、决計任用國人駕駛、總船主與船舶科主任、亦一致表示同情、遂由理事會公决、海亨船員全用國人充任、已令即日準備到船任事、</p>
<p>寗願犧牲港綫</p>
<p>惟用華人船主、最大限度、不過香港不出搭客船牌、局方討論之下、以新置海輪、目的專在汕粤、本非專備香港客位、故寗願犧牲香港搭客、决不能遷就港方主張、自貶國家地位、此事發表後、我國航業界與駕駛船員等、對該局不屈不撓、咸表示十分敬佩云、</p>

<p>東方旅行社主辦之平瀋通車、自實行以來、將及五月、一度曾傳該社將行改組、嗣即消息沉寂、緣該社本爲中國旅行社及日本觀光局合組、而最近又有兩方不願承辦之意、新聲社記者昨晨特訪兩方負責人員、採詢真相、兹分記詳情於後、</p>
<p>陳湘濤談話　據中國旅行社社長陳湘濤談、東方旅行社之組織、規定須向中國政府註册、中旅社及觀光局兩方面、迄未正式簽訂任何合同、故亦未辦理註册、初日方代表平山、曾擬一合同草案、送我方代表張水淇寄滬後、本人囑將其內容一二點、須加修正、旋平山表示、暫行不必簽訂合同、觀光局方面、俟試行承辦期滿、即擬將責任擺脱、張代表當亦表示、中國旅行社之意亦同、是此意原爲日方先行提出也、東方旅行社自成立後、一切均擅自處理、中國旅行社向未過問、在此情形下、徒負名義、實可不必、且中國旅行社接受鐵道路之委託、係「試辦六個月、」故本社復六月十三日鐵道部總字第二三六九號之公函、亦即以上項董事會所决議之意見奉復、（按該函曾經發表）今日方國際觀光局既不願續辦、則本社方面自亦甚願根據以前董事會决議、希望於十二月三十一日試辦期滿、即行如期結束、况東方旅行社負責人平山與張水淇等、均有以私人名義接辦之意、則本社更所樂從、如鐵道部仍須繼續、則有待董事會之决定也、</p>
<p>觀光局表示　又據日本國際觀光局上海分局經理籐末虔三談、關於該局擬退出東方旅行社消息、究竟如何、滬上方面、真相如何、尚未明瞭、因此事係東京總局主辦、迄未對滬局有何表示也、</p>
<p>日當局態度　記者昨晨更往日本鐵道省上海事務所探詞、當由其當局奥谷三郎出見、據謂關於此事、觀光局方面、迄並未向政府有任何請求、而官塲亦迄並未接得任何正式消息、余意此訊殆係謡傳、縱觀光局及中國旅行社誠有不願繼續承辦之意、中日雙方政府、亦必以政府力量、使其打消此意、繼續承辦、更進一歩説、縱東方旅社不獲繼續、則另行成立一種機關、亦未爲不可、</p>

<p>日文日日新聞云、沈家灣實業百貨商店、前爲附設菜點部、與全埠日商飲食店同業組合、發生齟齬、組合方面、從擁護利益的立塲、恊議對策、而實業百貨店從業員、送脅廹於飲食店組合、於是組合方面、愈爲激昂、向總領事館呈訴、又實業百貨店、擬新設理髮部、並以半强硬態度、與理髮業發生衝突、因此組合員與百貨店之抗爭、益形激烈、昨夜雙方、均開緊急會議、恊議應付之策、此因百業不景氣、各業小資本家、因百貨店之競爭、難以立足、有以致之、即百貨店對於任何部分、大抵較其他商店爲廉、例如啤酒、百貨店每瓶售四角八分、而料理店則售七角、於是小資本之經營、遂受重大影響、此種對抗、在日本內地、已成爲社會問題、今不幸竟發生於上海日商間、其糾紛之結果、殊難預測云、</p>
<p>日據每日新聞云、實業百貨商店、自成立以來、已屆一年、該店營業最發達者、爲食堂部、每日平均有六千五百元左右、推其營業之所以發達者、附設各部份貨物、咸比普通單獨經營小商店爲廉、如啤酒日本酒鋤燒（牛鳥魚肉火鍋）等、因特别廉價、與組合方面曾發生衝突、雙方各有主張、日當局亦無從裁斷、然而百貨店食堂之廉貨、因各貨批價稍廉、故售價亦低、自與貪圖暴利之商店、不能同日而語云、</p>

<p>近年以來、政府鑒於過去教育設施與國民實際生活之不相應、廼力圖有所矯正、在中央所宣示之教育宗旨中、曾屢以養成國民刻苦耐勞之精神、增進國民生産技能爲言、於其所頒行之教育實施辦法中亦確定以『勞作』『生産』『實用』爲各級教育之核心、於是在普通學校中『手的訓練』、亦漸視與『腦的訓練』同等重要、在教育整個系統中、職業教育亦漸視與普通教育同等重要、教育部爲執行中央教育政策、近年以來、一面積極注意中小學勞作科目之設置、一面則力圖全國職業教育之改進、如訂定各省市中等學校設置及經費支配標準辦法、以確定職業教育經費應佔比率、矯正過去偏重普通中學之弊、規定各省市縣推行職業教育程序、以定進行歩驟、制定各省市職業學校職業學科師資登記及訓練辦法大綱、以期改善師資、頒行職業學校各科教學科目及時數概要與職業學校各科課程表教材大綱及設備概要、以示教學標準等等、均爲教部近年以來力圖推進職業教育之設施、</p>
<p>惟各省市推行職業教育之最近成績、究竟曾否達到政府所預期之最低標準、曾否實現各該省市事實上所可能之進歩、實有切實考察之必要、教育部本年內曾指定區域、分派專員、視察職業教育、實地考核、徒以人力及時間限制、未能作普遍詳密之視察、且所注重者爲法令之執行及一般情况、對於教學實在成績、尚鮮細密之查考、此次舉行全國職業學校及中小學勞作科成績品展覽會、其目的即在檢閲各省市職業教育及中小學勞作訓練之實績、</p>
<p>此次展覽會在我國興學史上、尚屬創舉、其於今後職業教育及中小學中之勞作訓練、自可發生重大影響、惟教部同人絶不願有絲毫的誇張或紛飾、對於此次展覽品、甚望其能合於次列諸條件、第一能代表平時一般成績、而非臨時特别製作之品、第二能顯示科學的技術、第三具有實用價值、足以表現校作業與社會生産之合一、實際上諸展覽品是否具備以上條件、則甚望參觀人士悉心體察、尤望羣以體察之結果昭示吾人、俾從事教育行政與學校工作者、得以確定今後改進之途徑、</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>中國最繁盛的所在，自然是上海。上海最繁盛的所在，自然英租界裏的南京路，即大呼大馬路者是也。再説到大馬路的繁盛的中心點，那麽，我想，該算是日昇樓了吧。</p>
<p>不錯，日昇樓是南京路與浙江路的交义點，而正南方，還有一條湖北路。若是用飛機到半空裏去攝取一幀日昇樓，鳥瞰圖，我想交义着的南京浙江二路，再加上一條湖北路，或許果然是像五條蜿蜿蜒蜒的生龍了。日昇樓是一家已有很悠久的歷史，茶樓，原名五龍日昇樓，今人簡稱之曰日昇樓，而不言五龍，這實是一個大大的錯誤。</p>
<p>日昇樓，居於南北東西交通總樞紐的地位，各種車輛與行人，一大批，一大批的不絶來往着，所以有人説，每天二十四小時之中，經過日昇樓的，至少當有十萬人。這話，雖然没有精確的統計作證，但是據我瞧來，這數目，或許還嫌説得太小呢。</p>
<p>先施，永安二大公司，與日昇樓頭對峙着，在浙江與湖北路之間，永安還在建築新屋。落成之後，這個上海的繁盛中心點，自將益發雄壯了。但是我希望在這靠東的一帶二轉角，永久的維持着原狀。一則可以永保着五龍日昇樓，二則怕的五個大厦豎立着，没有了烟兑，糖食，水菓，點心等店舖子，以及其他一切，如糖炒栗子攤，生煎饅頭攤等之後，不再有吸引行人的能力了呀。</p>
<h3 id="c202">窓口的趣味 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 以文</p>
<p>人的性情，很容易受環境的影響，甚至環境會决定人的意志，所以，孟母要有擇鄰的事。爲的是變換一個環境，會使人感着新趣味的我們不嫌搬塲的麻煩，從一個較大的舊居，搬進了小的新居，新居裏，恰能放二張床，二張台子，同一張凳，句一個人是只能坐在床上做事的走路要學着蟹横行，小得這樣，似乎有些討嫌。但是，窓口的風景，倒很不差，牆上的絲籮，蔓延到窗口，無力地垂着，遮去了窗的三分之一。花園路上的樹木，從窗口看去，綠蔭很是深濃，間或，還有一二片飄飄的落葉飛下。遠近的房屋，隱隱地現着，悄悄地，没有車輪的軋軋，没有人們的喧噪、想不到熱鬧的上海，竟也有這樣幽静的區域。到了晚上，暮色籠罩着沈鬱的樹，獨有一盞路燈，好像是一顆光芒四射的星，房裏的燈火熄後、路燈的光，透過玻璃，照得壁上印着模糊的絲籮的影。早上醒來，太陽直射着我們的窗，壁上斑駁的樹影，如同銀幕一樣，而另有别緻的，是上面的氣窗，用鉛片代替玻璃，中間剪了個圓洞，陽光穿過圓洞，照得壁上有個分外明亮的白的圓，這個白圓，同斑駁的樹影，在一個幾乎全部都黑的鏡框中，也可以看見，兩兩相對，真是莫明真假，漸漸的移動終至没有了。總之，我們的新居雖小，可是窗口的趣味不小，窓口的趣味可以抵消房間的窄狹的苦處而有餘，所以我們便很安的住下了。</p>

<p>— （仲）</p>
<p>握手，本來是歐洲國家的禮儀，到了現在，已普及於全世界，就在我國，也很盛行。人們無論老少，無論男女，相見都要互相握一握手，以代替點頭，鞠躬及作揖等禮節。但是握手這件事的來歷如何，却很少有人知道的。我現將聽自西友的話寫給大家看：</p>
<p>原來這一件事發生在上古時代的歐西一帶的。那時的歐人，性格勇敢而且直爽，出外必於腰間佩掛刀劍，以作護身之具。因爲上古人民，在共同生活中，偶爾發生了齟齬，彼此都得把刀劍拔出來互相示威；要是一方對前事已有切實之表示，一方就伸出他的右手來，握對方的手，而對方要是同情，亦伸出他的右手，以表示言歸於好。</p>
<p>在這樣一段簡單的史實中，我們可以明白了握手的來歷。可是現代的人們，連握手發生地的歐人，對於這一件事已經和點頭鞠躬等禮節一樣普通，不很有什麽意義好説了。只有在足球塲網球塲上，兩方健兒在比賽時，都像仇敵一般光景，等到比賽終結了，彼此都伸出手來，互相握握，這倒有些上古西歐人民的遺風呢！</p>

<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅廹敷粉學風流</p>
<p>可是浣花却誤會了，他以爲賈多才在欣賞他的姿色，不時的咬了那淺薄的嘴唇微笑，又將那有深框的眼睛，斜了向賈多才偷覷着。賈多才越見他那些做作，越覺難受，便轉過臉去，和李士廉談話。楊浣花聽説賈多才是個銀行裏的人，十二分的願意接近，不想祗説了幾句同鄉的交情，他就不理會了。要和他接上一點電流吧？他又掉過臉子去了，難道走上前，把他的臉扭轉過來不成？低頭向自己懷裏看了一會子，有了個主意了，借了棹上放下的一包烟捲拿到手上來，向許多人笑問道：那位抽烟嗎？郭敦品倒知趣，向他道：敬這位賈先生一枝罷。浣華更不待他答話，已是用那三個瘦削的指頭，夾了一枝烟捲送到賈多才面前來。這時，他决不能再爲拒絶，也祗好站起來將烟接着。浣華更是歩歩進逼，早伸手到衣袋裏去摸出一盒火柴來，擦了一根，向前伸着，要替賈多才點火。他真没有料到他會這樣客氣的，所以那烟捲還不曾放到嘴裏去。浣花却真有那種耐性，兩指嵌了一根點着的火柴，微彎着腰，静静的等着。直等賈多才嘴裏啣了烟以後，給他來點上，那火柴的火燄，已是燃燒到手指邊上來了。賈多才看他這番殷勤，自然也有些不過意，於是向他笑道，到這裏來的人，都是客，你就不必客氣了。他微笑着，回到原位子上去坐下了。郭敦品坐在床上，比較是離着遠一點，他心裏想着，老賈也娮還没有將他看淸楚，所以還是淡淡的樣子。（七四）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這裏所有的幽寂而富有古意的空氣，高大而茂盛的樹木，以及花鳥的點綴之缺乏，差不多全是天生就的，人力怎能改造得來？除非把北京皇宫中所有的陳設，花木，魚鳥等等一起遷移過來，終不能蓋藏過它們原有的古樸和空洞的真面目；就是能够蓋藏過：也只是等於塗上了一重粉飾，它們的本質是永遠無從更換的！</p>
<p>我終於因爲震顫過甚而不能在廊下久留，怱怱回到了我自己的寢室中去。</p>
<p>我們這一間寢室裏一起躺着四個人，除我和我的妹妹之外，還有兩個女官跟我們一起住着。其時伊們三個人都已睡得很很濃了，因爲恐怖和不安寗的幻覺始終不曾侵入伊們的腦神筋，伊們自易安然入夢了。可是我呢？却兀是惴惴然惟恐大禍之將臨，連吹熄燭火的勇氣也没有。雖然我自己也很明白，這是一種愚蠢得十分可笑的思想，像這樣刁斗森嚴的宫禁之內，難道真會有什麽不幸的事件，臨到我們頭上來嗎？無庸懷疑，這是絶對不可能的！我而且還知道這時候太后已在那正殿的寢宫裏睡得非常的安適，既然太后的心上一些没有恐懼或不安，那末我是伊的侍從女官，當然也應不受絲毫的恐嚇，勉力學着伊的鎭定的態度，爲什麽還要疑神疑鬼的自己作弄自己呢？</p>
<p>就在這樣自相矛盾，思潮起伏的狀態中，我獨自悄悄地爬上了床去。初上床的時候，我很堅决地自信今晚是不用想有安穩的覺好睡了，也許連眼皮也不能合上：但後來在床上翻騰了半晌之後，不知道我怎樣下了一個决心，居然把眼皮合上了，而且還是睡得很舒服，連天亮也不知道。（一八四）</p>

<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>方言各地不同，非生長本地者，每不易索解。上海方言尤較别地爲複雜，有音無字者頗屬不少，然其中亦不乏可用文字表白，及有來源可考者。兹舉數例如次，藉見一斑。</p>
<p>毛病　俗以習氣爲毛病，語見黄山谷刀筆：「此荆南人毛病。」</p>
<p>關子　事之緊要處也，語出唐書。李逢吉用事時，親厚者有張又新，李仲言等八人，又有從而附麗者八人，皆任顯要，時人目爲八關十六子。凡有干求，必先賂關子，而後達逢吉，則事無不遂。俗又有賣關子一語，言藏其緊要之語，秘不肯宣也，來源或即同此。</p>
<p>垃圾　舊作拉扱，言塵土雜物穢積也。然夢梁錄有「諸河載垃圾糞土之船，」則二字之爲用，由來亦久矣。</p>
<p>空頭　虚而少實之謂，見北史斛律金傳：「空頭漢合殺。」</p>
<p>面子　俗稱有光榮爲面子，舊唐書張濬傳：「賊平之後，方有面子。」</p>
<p>豬玀　上海人駡人之語，實爲豬婁之訛。左傳：「既定爾婁豬，盍歸找艾豭。」</p>
<p>正經　不挾詐趨邪之謂也。詩君子陽陽章，譜云：「路寢之常樂，風之正經。」</p>
<p>惡　糞俗謂之惡，讀去聲。前漢昌邑王傳：「如是青蠅惡矣。」顔師古註曰：「即矢也。越王勾踐爲吳王嘗惡。」</p>
<p>頭家　設局邀賭以取頭錢者曰頭家，亦曰抽頭。唐英華薛恁有戲樗蒲頭賦云：「鑒坐中之奔北，非爲席上之司頭。」又蘇長公記少年有博者，以千金得賭錢不輸方，歸發視其方曰，但止乞頭。即抽頭也。</p>
<p>差路　不正曰差路。唐詩云，松木巖前差路多。</p>
<p>擡舉　扶持曰擡舉。白樂天高荷詩：亭亭自擡舉。</p>
<p>打孛　俗作打棚，調弄别人以自取樂也。吳下諺聯：「任爾穿花來打孛。」</p>
<p>薄相　俗作白相，亦作孛相，爲吳中通行之俗語，意謂嬉戲也。黄山谷與範長老書云：「韓十逐日上鄰學，且護其薄相耳。」又趙閑遊華山寄元裕之詩：「山神戲人亦薄相。」</p>
<p>黄六　虚詐不實曰黄六。沈自南藝林彚考云：「黄巢行六而多詐，故詐騙人者曰黄六。」</p>
<p>交關　俗稱極多曰交關，語出晋書裴秀傳：「交關人事。」</p>
<p>温暾　物之熱而不甚者曰温暾。白樂天開元寺詩：「池水暖温暾；」又王建宫詞：「新晴草色暖温暾。」</p>
<p>作人情　餽人以物稱爲作人情，見杜工部詩「粔粧作人情。」</p>
<p>訂真　俗以認真爲訂真，又訛爲頂真，源出王充論衡，就世俗之書，訂其真僞，辨其虚實。</p>
<p>乾癟　物枯乾也，見七修類藍詩，「丞相做事業，專用黄蔡葉，西風一夜起乾癟。」俗稱乞丐爲癟，謂其寒無衣，饑無食，居然室，衣食住三項俱乾癟而無着落也。</p>
<p>欵乃　音如靄襖，乃肩夫荷重物時一聲欵，聲乃，或自相應和，或兩相應和所發之聲也。源本棹船歌，朱子辨云：「欵乃棹船相　將」，今人倒呼之誤矣。</p>
<p>連忙　急於成工之謂。朱子集雲答記事詩：「逐急添茅蓋，連忙畢土田。」</p>
<p>㜘　上海人稱物之美者曰㜘，其音如誣。嵇叔夜琴賦：「或怨㜘而躊躇。」</p>

<h3 id="c217">現實的與浪漫的 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 企</p>
<p>不管文學史家如何把文學潮流劃分爲現實主義與浪漫主義兩大類，但在文學實踐中這兩種傾向却在種種不同的歷史條件之下各具有種種不同的藝術的社會的內容，而且常互相綜錯，不能機械地分開來。同一個作家的創作裏可以包含現實的和浪漫的兩種要素。就是最優秀的現實主義的作家有時也會把幻想的成分滲進現實裏，這在文學史上，是數見不鮮的。</p>
<p>在莎士比亞的戲曲裏我們看見了哈孟雷特的父親之亡靈的出現，可怕的妖怪廵逡於舞台之上，以及現實被誇張得非常可怕的地方。巴爾扎克的「鮫皮」是被稱爲比一切科學研究更能給人以關於當時法國社會的明確概念的，但「鮫皮」卻是一篇Fantastic的故事。郭歌里的小傑作「外套」裏出現了在夜間剝取行人外套的鬼怪，「鼻子」的主人公會看見自己失落的鼻子坐着馬車在街上跑，還自稱五等文官。「維依」（Viy）更是一篇讀之令人毛髮悚然的神怪故事。然而這種浪漫的幻想和現實的描寫之可驚的結合却並没有妨礙這些作家是文學史上最偉大的現實主義者。</p>
<p>對現實主義和浪漫主義的舊式的區分法是不可靠的。狄納莫夫（Dinamov）在一篇關於莎士比亞的文章裏指示了對現實主義的正確的看法，是值得我們參考的。現在且把狄納莫夫的話引用如下：</p>
<p>「對於莎士比亞的評價並不是依據於他的現實主義的外表（External　Aspecrs），重要的是在莎士比亞没有用觀念論的觀點去看現實，他在意圖上，內容上，他的作品性質上是現實主義者，他利用各種各樣的文學戲劇的形式和體裁，從喜劇到悲劇，從悲劇到輕鬆的故事，從没有把客觀現實當成簡單的『精神』的反映，他的基礎根本是周圍世界，現成的而非杜撰的」。</p>
<p>從這段話裏我們可以看出現實主義的標準來。一個作家，如果他對現實的根本認識不是從抽象的主觀的觀念而是從現實及其本身的客觀定律出發的話，則他的作品即使有把現實幻想化的地方，仍然是現實主義的作品。反之，浪漫主義的文學卻是以澈頭澈尾的主觀的觀念論的態度去對付現實的。幻想，對幻想的渴望是浪漫主義的根源。在浪漫主義者看來，幻想就是現實。用浪漫的幻想來代替灰色的現實，這實際上不過是對於現實的一種逃避罷了。浪漫主義作爲一種趨勢（Trend）正是這樣的東西。</p>
<p>進歩的文學應該繼承現實主義的精神，把兩脚堅牢地立在現實上，這是毫無疑義的。不過牠同時必須踏過舊現實主義的界限，把浪漫主義當作牠的藝術創作的必然的一面。在這裏，浪漫主義只是現實主義的一個構成部分，而並不是作爲一種趨勢和現實主義對立的。浪漫的要素，呈現在真實的人生中。如果我們對人生的積極面作深刻透視的時候，我們一定可以發現許多使人難於相信的英雄的（Heroic）的題材吧。</p>
<p>舊現實主義的文學卻是非英雄的。牠以對於人生的黑暗面的偏愛爲特色。牠所寫的盡是社會的醜惡，腐敗與虚僞。這些作家們寫不出「高尚與美麗的事物」，他們筆下的人物大都是不會有光明的思想與良好的行爲的俗物們（Philitsines）。所以他們的作物愈是現實的，就愈煊染了陰鬱暗淡的色調，而缺少可以令人歡忻鼓舞的浪漫的英雄的氣分。這種氣分在進歩的現實主義的作品裏却充分地表現出來。因爲祇有進歩的作家纔能深入人生的積極面，從那裏找出可歌可泣英勇壯烈的事實來。</p>
<p>「現實主義云者就是除開仔細真實外還要正確地傳達典型的環境中的典型的性格」這是至理名言。所以作家必須具有把生活現象典型化普遍化的能力，他所要表現的與其説是生活自身，毋寗説是關於生活的真理。典型的東西並不是現代的，可以隨拾即得的，而是由作者在許多東西中把那典型的，特質的，共通的抽來，綜合而成的。唐吉訶德或哈孟雷特並不真有其人，而是莎士比亞，西萬提斯從許許多多人中取出最典型的特質，習慣，趣味，希望，信仰語法等等，將牠們統一在這兩個人物身上，因此大家都覺得自己的血管裏有些唐吉訶德或哈孟雷特的成分在內、這種概括的典型，即便被誇張到非常浪漫的程度，也還是具有藝術的真實性的。</p>
<p>藝術的概括有時簡直是一種「豫見」。作者由現實攝取隱秘的未發展的或在胎芽中的一片叚，在人們還没有覺察出來的時候，就用誇張的形式指給他們看，於是那一片叚的本質就更典型，更明顯了。當「虚無主義」還没有成爲俄國社會的一大潮流，而屠格湼夫便把一個虚無主義者典型的人物描寫在「父與子」裏的時候，當時的批評家們是把那看成作者空想出來的東西的。他們不知道那正是現實之藝術的概括。</p>
<p>藝術的概括不是事實之單純的表現，如果没有創造的想像力或幻想，是不能把現實的素材改製爲藝術品的。浪漫主義者們用以逃避現實，神馳於虚無飄渺之境的那種幻想，在進歩的現實主義的作品中，絶不能佔有位置，自不待言。但幻想本身並不是壞事，不能幻想的人毋寗説是愚蠢的。進歩的作家要在歷史的運動中去看現實，從現實中找出在時代的發展上具有積極意義的方面，而且要把那方面的未來的輪廓表現出來。他不但要描寫現實中已經存在的東西，而且也要描寫現實中可能存在的東西。這就有賴於豐富的幻想。然而這樣的幻想並不是和現實的進行相矛盾，而正是可以鼓舞人們去努力實現牠的。文學作品滲進了這種幻想的要素的時候很可能帶有浪漫主義的色彩。而這種浪漫性是在現實中生着根，具有照耀現實，充實現實的作用的。</p>
<p>要踏過現實表面的界限，深入現實綜合現實，達到現實之本質的真實的反映，這不但要有正確的世界觀，而且還要有對於現實的深刻洞察和想像之廣大的自由纔行的。</p>

<p>— 東萌</p>
<p>在燈下讀書的時候，有許多蜉蝣飛來撞去在幾度打擾之後，便落在紙上了。到了第二天，這些小東西的屍體，便成陣地横陳在白紙上，有如不甚規則地鑲嵌着的花紋。</p>
<p>友人稱蜉蝣朝生暮死，這小東西的壽命，大概不很長久，然而依勃想克底神秘的詩句，一粒沙一個世界的眼光觀之。則彼等之生存年代，亦可以説是無限。宇宙雖大，然而比到别的行星，却是異常的渺小。就拿動物來説，許多木然無知的東西，如龜象類，不也都比人類的年齡大得多麽。如果我們不願意自己誇大的話？那末！地球的年齡比之别的許多行星，是極其短促了。兩者相較，也不免自氣餒起來，而有生暮死之感罷？</p>
<p>然而人類到底是有靈性的東西，其所以高出於萬物者在此。蜉蝣至多算是微生物，你看，牠的形態是多麽渺小！中國詩人有一妙喻：謂蜉蝣撼大樹，多見其不自量。人類間，却没有這樣的情形。即使相互鬥，有着傾軋，爭鬥，或者近於殘酷的殺戮。但總是各擇其可以角觸的對手，拿來推擠排斥踐踏；亦可以説是撼吧；然而所撼的却是自己的同類。更是在没有動手之前，就已决定了自己的目的物。</p>
<h3 id="c220">喝早茶的人 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 尹光</p>
<p>除了家庭，在四川，茶館，恐怕就是人們唯一寄身的所在了。我見過很多的人，對於這個慢慢酸化着一個人的生命和精力的地方，幾乎成了一種嗜好，一種分解不開的寵倖，好像鴉片烟癮一樣。</p>
<p>一從舖蓋窩裏爬出來，他們便紐結也不扣，披了衣衫，趿着鞋子，一路嗆咳着，上茶館去了。有時候，甚至早到茶爐剛剛發火。這種過早的原因，有時是爲了在夜裏發現了一㸃值得告訴人的新聞，一張開眼睛，便覺得不從肚子裏掏出來，實在熬不住了。有時卻僅僅爲了在舖蓋窩里，夜深的時候，從街上，或者從鄰居家裏聽到一點不尋常的響動，想早些打聽明白，來滿足自己好奇的癖性。</p>
<p>然而，即使不是爲了這些，而是因爲習慣出了毛病，這也不會使他們怎樣感到掃興。他們儘可以在黎明的薄暗中，蹲在日常坐慣了的位置上，打一會兒盹。或者從堂官口裏，用一兩句簡單含糊含的問話，探聽一點自己没關照到的意外的故事。</p>
<p>「這樣晏……睡得遲嗎？」</p>
<p>「水巷子又出怪事哩，」堂官解釋道，「他們就把那爛貨弄在階沿上，……」</p>
<p>「嘻，我是説那裏嘻嘻哈哈的，」客人滿足地發笑了。</p>
<p>自然，倘是堂官簡捷地回答説，「還早呢。」他們便很快地迷糊過去了，直到把茶泡上，那個在打更匠睏覺時就醒轉來了的可憐人，招呼説「泡起了呢，」這纔從喉嚨裏應聲道，「哼，」或者微微點一點頭。不過即使他們一無聲響，堂官一經招呼，便算義務已盡，各自管照自己的工作去了。</p>
<p>當他們發覺茶已經泡好了的時候，總是先用二指頭沾一點，潤潤眼角，然後緣着碗邊，很長地吹一口氣，現法浮在碗面上的炒焦了的茶梗和碎葉，一氣喝下大半碗去。於是吹着火烟筒，咳喘住一團，恰像一個問話符號似的。要到茶堂里有别的客坐下了，這種第一個上茶舖的人，纔現出一個活人的模樣，拏出精神來，用遲緩的調子，報告出堂官講説過的故事，夾雜着感慨和議論。</p>
<p>「還是那壞東西不好，見了人就打打狂狂的。」</p>
<p>「母狗不擺尾，公狗不上背呀！」别的人附合着。</p>
<p>等到這一類的談話可以告一段落了，報告者呵欠，揉一揉眼皮，向茶爐邊嘟噥道，「還没洗臉呢。」於是堂官拖過一張凳子，擺在家人坐位邊順手的地方，打了臉水來。像這樣，要洗臉，是不必改變蹲着的姿式的。祗需略微側一側身子，斜伸出兩支手去，就行了。然而，要是還没參加别的茶客的談話，要洗一張臉子，那時間是會費得很長久的。</p>
<p>「您這話一點也不寃枉他。我看到的，比這更醜呢。比方説……」剛用指頭提起來的臉帕，又落在臉盆里面去了。</p>
<p>有時候，需得堂官另外換上一盆臉水，他們纔能够完成這一件十分困難的工作。於是一邊趿上鞋子，扣着紐扣，一邊踱往街對過的酒釀灘上去，躬着身子向裝着物事的担子打量一回，然後點着指頭，一字一字地叮嚀道：</p>
<p>「聽淸白了麽？——加一個蛋。要新鮮的。好，就是這一個罷。您照照我看，……」</p>
<p>當小菜販沿着冷前的街市呌賣起來了的時候，他們總照例買上一點豆芽，堆在茶桌上，一根一根地擷着根，恰像繡花一樣的精細。從他們的神情上看來，這還是一種近乎闊氣的舉止呢。這擷好了菜，家里的孩童們，是自會來取回的，用不着他們動歩；祗需千篇一律地關照道：</p>
<p>「從不説得來，——多加一點醋，炒生一點，！」</p>
<p>早飯的時候，直到家里的人催過三五遍了，他們纔一面慢騰騰地，把茶碗端到茶桌子中間去，呌堂官照料着，讓吃過飯再來，一面戀戀地同茶客們開談着，好像十分不願意走開去似的。</p>
<p>「又怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「又怎樣，還不是認錯了事。」</p>
<p>「我早就説罷，再讓他吃一點辣子；我倒凉爽呢。……」</p>
<p>到這時，全個早晨的時間，已經給他們花費乾净了。但他們毫不覺得可惜。其實，也没有想到，這一點。等到肚子一飽，又有許多時光，在等待着他們，像闊人使用資財一樣地浪費了。</p>
<p>在這里，我但願目前的震盪不會攬擾他們。</p>

<p>— （Joseph　Conrad著）吳向隅譯</p>
<p>在柯爾柏魯克的港口，大家所知道的海格波特船長並不是怎樣受人歡迎的人物。他並不是這地方的人。他從前會住在這地方的理由並不怎樣神秘——他常把那些理由公開地告訴人——但那些理由是極荒謬不可信的。他很顯然是有一些錢的，因爲他曾買一塊地，並造了兩座極低廉的很難看的黄磚小屋。他自己住了一座，而把别一座出租給約夏，嘉維爾——瞎子嘉維爾是個造船者——有着家庭專制魔王的壞名譽。</p>
<p>這兩座小屋當中一堵牆是共同的，前面的兩方小園是用鐵栅隔開；後面的兩方小天井用木栅隔開。貝珊，嘉維爾小姐似乎有着指定的權利一樣，可以把那要晒乾的檯布，藍的破衣，或一條裙晒在當中。</p>
<p>『那要把木頭爛掉的，貝珊我的女孩子』，那位船長從他的木栅那邊温和地説，每次當他看見她施行那特權的時候。</p>
<p>她是一個長身的女子；木栅是低矮的，她能够把她的兩肘擱在木栅的上面。她的兩手在她洗好一些衣服後，一定是紅的，但她的前臂却是白而美的，她總是默默地看着她父親的地主——這種含有意義的沉默中，帶着一種親切的企翹的熱望的態度在裏面。</p>
<p>『那要把木頭爛掉的，』海格波特船長重複地説。『在你，我知道這不過是一種不愛惜的無意議的習慣。你在後面天井爲什麽不懸一條繩呢？』</p>
<p>嘉維爾小姐對於這一些也不説什麽——她只消極地摇摇頭。在她的一邊的後天井內，有一塊黑土的花床，四周用石圍着，在這裏面，有着幾顆她閒暇時候種的花，看起來已長得極繁盛，像悠屬　異國的一樣；而在木栅的那邊，野花長與膝齊，海格波特船長只現在一個直挺的健康的身體，包在第一號從頭至脚帆布衣服中。他用着這種顔色，這種他所選擇做衣服的粗硬的特殊衣料人家看起來——這是他的目前的給人觀察的一種無聲的標記——正像青灰石化成的一個殭硬的人直立一塊不够做一間好的彈子房大的荒野中一樣。總之他是一個壯大的石人，有着紅而美的顔面，一隻藍而無神的眼睛，一把下垂到胸口，柯爾柏魯克人從來没有看見他剪剃過的大鬍子。</p>
<p>七年以前，柯爾柏魯克著名的滑稽家那位理髮匠，一天剛巧驕傲地坐在海口的「新旅店」的酒排間內，這位船長也到那兒去買一昂司的烟葉，理髮匠曾頑皮地問他什麽時候他就可以做他的生意，船長很嚴重地回答他「我想，下一個月」。當他從插在袖口中的手巾內拿出了一個半辨士付賬後，海格波特船長走了出去。門一關好，那位理髮匠大笑起來。『這老傢伙同一個青年人馬上就要手挽手到我的店中理髮了。裁縫也快有生意，理髮匠有生意，臘燭店也快有生意；好時候要到柯爾柏意克來了，要來了，一定的。他常常回答「下星期」，現在他却説「下一個月」，也許不久，據我想來，要説「明春」了。』</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>在這世界火藥庫遍佈，而火藥氣息亦復瀰漫的現在，是「和平爲懷」的慈悲家和外交家頂出風頭的時候，如像羅馬教皇不久以前祈禱和平會，總教蔡寗來華後在北平及各地所開的祈禱和平會，均曾轟動一時，震播遐邇。至若法外長巴爾都，因馬塞慘案身殉而爲「和平」奔走之聲益著，英國前外長漢德森由努力「軍縮」，獲諾貝爾和平奬章而得名，均其犖犖大者。</p>
<p>但世界列强在此經濟恐慌浪潮中，爲覓取市場而角逐，爲分割殖民地而伙併，「地大物博」的中國，早成了各帝國主義攫取之主要目的，戰爭的結果無論誰勝誰負，均將以中國作犧牲品；作戰時的踐踏，事後的宰割，其受惠者均將是中國所殘存着的土地與四萬萬人民。一想及這黄帝子孫所必然遭到的蹂躪和命運，真是「不寒而慄」，我們之反對大戰擁護和平，若不以「人道主義」挽回甚麽「人類刦運」，而以自身的解放爲實益，其主旨固在此。</p>
<p>可是帝國主義的必然趨於以戰爭來解决「重分天下」的問題，是現社會組織下的必然結論，而以「祈禱和平」的方式要他們不要戰爭，不異於勸張獻忠不要殺人，求他們不掠奪殖民地，更等於説服貓兒不要咬耗子。如若已被視如「俎上之肉」的我們，想從「祈禱和平」的方式中，找到一民族獨立解放之道，就純全像已决的囚，希望神天的搭救，來安慰自己。</p>
<p>自然，「祈禱和平大會」，就成了這一「進歩」的表現。然而真正的和平，却恐怕不能單單以「祈禱和平」四字，可以解决。</p>
<h3 id="c223">賣花女郎 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 陸印全</p>
<p>秋天是飄渺的，像抹飄渺的輕雲，在闇闇的銀海那麽深遠的西天上閃飄着，悄悄地漾來，現在又悄悄地漾過去了，再過一霎那，僅僅這一霎間，或許要看不到秋天的殘痕了。當秋天來的時候，我没有什麽特殊的感覺，説來有點兒奇異，有時竟並不曾感到秋天的存在，而現在要消逝的當兒，或却有些戀戀，縱然知道留戀的情緒是始終拖不住光陰的飛逝的，但固執的心緒還偏要如此；人啊，是多麽的儍呢。</p>
<p>别人都説秋天是藴藏在緋紅的楓葉</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>裏，肥蟹的尖螯裏的，而我，或許你們竟不會相信吧，是從窗外的一個賣夜來香女郎的呌喊聲裏，意會到秋天的存在，同時，也在這喊賣聲裏，我感覺到深秋的隕落。這絲凄凄的輕音，確是含滿了秋天的鬱鬱，不，不僅是一點鬱鬱，簡直是整個的秋天呢。</p>
<p>每天都是這樣，我從外面歸來，在窗畔讀些新到的雜誌，或拿起筆寫字的時候，一個怪憔悴的喊聲，從我底樓下，像深秋的氣息般地，佻輕刁飄過：</p>
<p>——賣夜來香啊！</p>
<p>這短短的喊聲，縱然是没有音樂的聲韻，但從這呌聲裏，爆發出秋那樣多量的悲愁。本來很恬静的心，現在也不免被這聲音顫得抑鬱起來了，即使喊聲是浮過去了，甚至聽不出了，而我底心上却依然壓着鉛塊般的窒塞，不知這窒塞到什麽時候才能融散呢？</p>
<p>在新秋的當兒，這女郎的賣花聲似乎還響亮些，現在却有似跟着秋的老去地漸漸憔悴起來了，我真不懂從一個妙齡女郎的嘴唇邊，怎會逸出這樣憔悴的聲音來呢？難道她没有青春麽？青春，在生活綫的絞織裏消逝了吧。</p>
<p>爲了一點憐惜和同情，我每天總要聽聽這悲怨的聲音，在静静的人生之流泉裏，加綴一些輕愁，倒也是需要的。</p>
<p>秋愈是深，她底聲音也愈是微弱了。但今天，怎樣的，我竟聽不見這喊聲了，她不來賣夜來香了麽？我想，大概她是跟着殘秋一同消逝了。</p>
<p>而我底心上却依然壓着鉛塊，即使樓角上也漾起了淡淡的悲愁。</p>
<h3 id="c224">公園裏 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 周漢</p>
<p>偶然高興，想要到公園裏頭去晒太陽。——住在没有太陽的家，對於太陽是好像引起了愛情似地在渴慕着了。</p>
<p>公園已經是滿園秋色：到處可以看見菊花。坡上是菊花，路邊是菊花，草地的中央也是菊花，我雖然不是爲賞菊而來，却也要瞟她幾眼，鑒賞一鑒賞黄的好還是白的好了。同時，一路賞菊一路跑到大草坪　的牆邊去找椅子坐晒太陽。</p>
<p>在那裏有好多江北媽媽在照顧外國孩子玩，她們有的手上在打毛綫衫，幽閒地。好容易被我找到了一把椅子，我坐下去，裝做打盹在晒太陽。兩個媽媽嘩啦嘩啦地在談話，説出一段風流事，她們以爲我睡着了呢。</p>
<p>一個年紀大一點的説，「他喜歡你呢」。另一個年紀小一點的馬上表示着一半難爲情一半生氣地回答，「没得這個話」，那大的爲要證明她的話引出時間和地點來了。她説，「昨天在後門邊，他不是和你談得蠻要好？」那小一點的不做聲了。我開開半隻眼瞟她一下，她的臉上的紅暈從頰上泛到耳根。我很想聽多一點，而她們照顧的外國孩子玩一玩跑遠去了，她們高聲地喊呌，「奥斯卡，瑪琍！」談話也就停止了。</p>
<p>一個法國小孩子騎着一隻三輪小車跑到我的身邊而停止，將我的脚都碰着了。他哈哈哈地大笑起來。我張開眼望他一下，那小孩子下了車子眼光盯住我好半天。我呌做運動，他誤會我的意思，而且不知爲什麽，却在草地上翻起筋斗來。他的媽媽老遠地喝住了他，而且跑來拉他的小手走開去了。</p>
<p>一羣俄國小孩子圍住了我。那是前幾天認識了的。他們要我起身領導他們學兵士的體操。孩子們真頑皮，我不肯，他們便都盤上我的身上來摸我的鬍子了。而且，有的在我的後面，在拉下我坐的椅子，使我倒下去了。碰到孩子們真没有辦法！於是乎照他們的意思站起來發號施令了。</p>
<p>大的在前，小的在後，已經排好隊伍了，可是有一個小的偏要站在前面，而那大的不肯，爭執起來，鬧珹一團，倒在地上打滾了。好容易將他們排成了隊伍，呌開歩走，而走不上幾歩遠，又跑散了。你們跑散，我可以安心坐下椅子晒太陽，我不管了，便坐在椅子上，連眼睛都閉上了。</p>
<p>可是，他們並不就此散開跑去，却又集攏來在一起，而且看我不理他們，又跑來找我了。這真是討厭不過的事。我提議着講故事給他們聽，這才答應下來。而且很天真地很親摯地張着小眼睛望着我講神怪的故事。</p>
<p>我想起了家裏的小弟妹們來了。家裏的小弟妹們也常常圍住着我聽我講故事呵。然而，潦倒半生，到處流浪的我，有家歸不得呵！出了公園，懷鄉病無日或已。</p>

<p>列車在黑暗的夜裏循着軌道輾進，三等車箱裏擠着各式各樣的人物，閙着各地的方言，吵得人發慌，可是，到了列車開駛一個鐘頭之後，在疲倦的襲擊中，那種毫無顧忌的，不論男女的横倒直躺的景象，真可謂蔚然大觀。</p>
<p>一個短髮白布上衣黑裙子的女學生，帶着一個被包和一隻箱子走進車箱裏來，把被包攔在上面的網裏，便把箱子作爲枕頭躺着，起先，她是灣曲着脚着，後來她竟將脚伸直架在一個陌生的男子腿上；睡得呼呼地呌；而那個男子也若無其事似地睡得很甜，有時還把一隻脚架上女的大腿呢。這麽一對陌生的男女交义着脚睡覺，并不是他們不曉得禮義廉恥，而是在這三等車座裏的環境，在支持不了的疲倦中，使他們很自然的做出來。從這裏使人想到了那些禁止男女同行同食的把戲，祇是一些茶餘酒後談話的資料吧了！</p>
<p>因爲大家全都躺着，彷彿這三等車箱裏就像個義塚。那個呆坐的胖子，就像一個看墳山的人，這胖子是個北方人，胖胖的臉龐，瞇着眼，蓄着八字鬍，樣子怪像那曾經在杭州設壇求雨的班禪大師，他老是微笑着，望着這横倒直躺的衆生，静默地抽着他的桿烟，一直到了列車進月台的時候，這胖子始終没有睡，這并不是他不想睡，而是所有的地位，全都被人佔去了。因此，他也就只好坐着了。那種禮讓的精神，是充分地代表了中國人的。</p>
<p>談到中國人的精神，這也是一個代表作呢。那是列車經過F站的時候，三等車箱裏增添了幾個人，其中有一個穿着長袍馬褂的紳士派頭十足的中年人，一看見這像義塚一樣的情景，便摇頭嘆息着：「這樣像　什麽樣子」！可是，過了一會兒，我們這一位中年的紳士，也就像忘記他剛纔講的是什麽話，而把身子塡進義塚裏去，而且鼾聲如雷；這樣像什麽樣子呢？不過，這種勇氣也着實可佩！</p>
<p>一個像走江湖那樣的人物，油頭滑腦的，却在同車的人只顧着睡覺没有注意他的時候，他竟用了不曉得是什麽手法，吊上了一個中年的婦人，本來他們是坐在中間，後來便悄悄地移到那個角落裏去。那個角落裏雖然有幾個護車的兵士在那裏，可全都睡熟了，讓他們兩個一見如故的人在談判其進行的手續。</p>
<p>厠所上雖然是標明了男女，可是，這三等車箱裏的人却似乎不管是男是女，祇要是厠所就得了。有一次一個男子走進女厠所去把門閉了，一個女人却在外面等着，等着，等着還不見那男的辦完公事出來，於是她便走進男厠所去了。還有一個老頭子和一個女子爭着進女厠所去的活劇，在這三等車箱裏演出。</p>
<p>列車駛進上海北站的時候，天已亮了，這三等車箱裏也就像列車剛開駛時那麽的吵閙起來了，那個「這樣像什麽樣子」的中年紳士帶着惺忪的眼走下車去，那個白布上衣黑裙子的女學生對於和一個陌生的男子交义着脚睡覺若無其事地走了，像班禪大師那個胖胖的北方人，依然是瞇着眼笑，爭厠所的人也各自散了，就祇有那個油頭滑腦的人帶着那個吊上的中年婦人一道去。一切的一切，在這三等車箱裏都像「大飯店」那樣的變幻着，因爲這同樣的是一個社會的縮影啊！</p>
<h3 id="c227">談「登龍」 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 淡然</p>
<p>凖備向文學這條路上走的人差不多都希望着「登龍」，誠然，「登龍」是取得地位的關隘，不「登龍」是不能聽到人家説你是「文學作家」的，要走文學這條路當然要想成「名」，要成「名」當然便要想到「登龍」了。這是用不着反對的事。不過，在這里我要來一個「當頭棒喝」。</p>
<p>近日在一個朋友的家里偶然翻到剪下來的南京朝報副刋，看到有一篇談到「章克標求職啟」的文章。「章克標求職啟」是登在申報分類廣告欄的，我以前没有看到。爲免除抄人家的文章起見，節錄他的要點是「數年來藉筆耕以爲生，號稱自由職業，實爲體面乞丐，兹爲生活，欲求職業一個」。</p>
<p>章克標原是以秘本「文壇登龍術」貢獻給一般人的，他的「登龍術」當然不壞。然而他是「兹爲生活，欲求職業一個」了。</p>
<p>這里，我們可以得到兩個解答：</p>
<p>第一，「登龍」雖然似乎有一定的界限，但究無實在的疆域。章克標已經「登龍」了嗎？假若説他「没有」，那麽我們便可以知道「登龍」之難了。以秘本「文壇登龍術」的作者竟不能達到「登龍」的目的，一般剛走文學這條路的人們總應當「知難而退」吧！</p>
<p>第二，我們從「章克標」這三個字有不少的人都熟習這一事實來説，我們自然可以説：「章克標是登龍了」。然而已經「登龍」的人尚要「兹爲生活，欲求職業一個」。則「登龍」的價值便很可懷疑了。「登龍」以後還不能解决自己的生活，還要求職業。『一般渴望着「登龍」的人們必須早些預備「糧草」』，必須把這一句話在「文壇登龍術」翻版的時候印在書面上。免得一般人蹈章克標的覆轍。</p>
<p>聽説在外國，一個作家是不愁生活的。有一部相當的作品發行，便一生吃喝不盡。然而那到底是外國啊。上帝註定你生在亞細亞的東部，你有什麽辦法？</p>
<p>最後我要堅一塊路牌，把「我與文學」裏面孫席珍的話借來寫在上面：『此道不可以安身立命』。</p>
<p>此外，我必聲明的：我這篇文章原是就事論事，自以爲是『慨乎其言之』。並没有輕薄章先生的意思。請章先原諒。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>你是迷途上的指示者，能够使一般遇到困難問題的人，得到相當的解决與明瞭，我是非常欽佩。我現在也有一個問題特冒昧地來懇求，希望你有暇的時候，就在這最近的幾天發表出來；那就感激不盡了。</p>
<p>三年前我是一家商舖中的學徒，有職員某甲，和我很是親近，但是他有一種惡習，對於跑狗可以説是没有一次不去的。所以他陸續的向我借去一百元之上，他的用途，大都是用在這個地方。在這筆欵子裏面，除了是我家中的錢，以外還有别人托吾寄遞，而給他借去的。當他借去的時候總是説不日就可理淸，同時用一種花言巧語，或是約了一同去看電影等等，年紀輕的我，怎經得起這樣的哄騙呢？</p>
<p>但是到了現在，因爲旁人的追廹，同自己經濟的拮据，我已經屢次向他索取，但是他竟置之腦後，若無其事的一樣。唉，呌我用什麽方法向他要錢呢？真是爲難極了。請先生指示一個辦法吧！敬祝</p>

<p>編者按：在借錢給人的時候，有一個先决問題，就是這個人借錢做什麽？假使他是用在正當方面，那末我們應該帮助他，借給他；但是他假使爲了不正當的用處，就應該加以拒絶，因爲你借錢給他去做壞事，你就成了助紂爲虐的人了。像宋君的朋友借了錢去跑狗，跑狗是種賭博，是一種很不好的惡習，那末就不應該借錢給他，可是宋君却因爲他的花言巧語的哄騙以及看電影，等等的誘惑，不但把自己的錢借給他，並且别人的錢也被他騙去輸掉了。這是宋君第一個錯誤的地方。</p>
<p>還有，關於借欵的種類有兩種：一種是道德上的借欵，這種借欵必須雙方交誼很深，談不到將來還不還的問題，並且那借錢的人平時的信用也很好，所以不必寫什麽借據。第二種是有擔保的借欵。這種借欵在事前必須有相當擔保，並且還要，另具字據，説明歸還日期，以作將來的憑證。宋君們的借欵當然談不到是道德上的借欵了，可是宋君在借欵時却没有呌他的朋友寫字據，實在是一個大大的錯誤。因爲没有字據，並且根據來信所述，似乎還没有第三者參與其間，那末他可以不顧良心的否認一切，那時在法律上他是不負責任的。</p>
<p>現在補救的方法只有趕快呌他寫張借據給你，最好請别人作證。有了借據你應該立刻向他要錢，不必再拖延下去了。</p>
<p>最後編者要聲明的就是，我們發表這封信的目的，不是在替宋君想出什麽方法來索還這筆欵子，而是在忠告一般讀者對於借錢給人的一些意見，希望大家注意到這點。</p>

<h3 id="c235">「次殖民地」的電影 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇萍</p>
<p>「中國是次殖民地，」許多人這樣説。不要談什麽政治，外交，經濟，軍事，這些國家大事，單説中國的電影罷，也具體地表現出次殖民地的特質。</p>
<p>從前洋大人拍好的影片，中國總是無條件接受的。近來外片也受檢查了，但，中國人不能拍的神怪片肉感片，洋大人是可以輸入公映的。辱華片不到中國來放映了，可是「大地」「煤油燈」等多少有辱華嫌疑的片子，却可以到中國內地找中國人來拍戲。</p>
<p>對於外片，中國人幾乎没有選擇取捨的權利。好萊塢拍好了影片，就可以拿到中國來做，不管中國觀衆聽得懂或聽不懂戲中的對白。在别個國度裏，外片的輸入放映，没有這樣簡單。美國片法國去，要改拍法語對白或加上法文字幕。法國片到德國去，就得改拍德語對白或加上德文字幕。就是在日本，外片都得加上日文字幕。雷電華的片子，還要在東京另請日本演員改拍日語對白的拷貝呢！中國的觀衆大約是語學的天才，無論英語片法語片德國片俄國片都得聽得懂。假使聽不懂，外國片商也不管，你還是到影戲院裏去練習外國語去罷。</p>
<p>咱們有國産電影，咱們有影片公司能自己拍戲，這當然是很光榮的。可是拍戲須守着一個範圍，不能越過本份。譬如説，有傷洋大人面子的塲面不要拍，免得有傷邦交，這還説得通（辱華片是否有傷邦交，這裏不必去論）。外國欺辱中國，洋大人横行覇道的事，也不要拍，這却爲了什麽，不免令人費解。至於同一事件，對方的國家拚命拍成影片駡我們，而我們却連記錄事實真相的新聞片都不能拍，拍了也不能公開放映，那却更令人莫明其土地堂了。所以，義勇軍的片子不能拍，淞滬之戰的片子不好拍，九一八事件不好拍，中國被侵略的歷史片也不能拍。「惡鄰」那樣寓言性質的片子，租界不許做，「爲國犧牲」也得被禁映，就連「上海二十四小時」那樣的生活素描的片子，因爲一點牽渉了租界的廵捕，到現在，公映還是遥遥無期呢。最近，情勢更加厲害了。「九一八」「一二八」「東北」這一類的字幕不好用，東北四省的地圖都不要上銀幕。中國電影界也真是太可憐了。</p>
<p>中國各方面的事業都有外資侵入，只有文化事業部門——不，嚴格地講，也只有書業和電影業還在中國資本的支配之下。可是近來報紙的消息，上海將有中外合資的影片公司出現了。本來，在外國，他國資本來經營電影事業的也有，好萊塢幾家大公司在英德法各國都有攝影塲，但情形是兩樣的。中國若有了中外合資的影片公司，不單幾家國産影片公司都得關門大吉，就連中國的電影事業，不，就連中國的文化，都要在外資的支配之下了。好在現在還只是傳説，也許不會成爲事實罷。姑拭目以俟好了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c236">評「黑貓」 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 石斧</p>
<p>“The　Black　Cat”大光明映</p>
<p>自從「陰森可怕」「鬼氣偪人」外加「巧妙機關」這一類的片子，也有一部份人歡迎之後，於是乎造成了兩個人的機會，鮑立斯卡洛夫·和裴拉羅哥西，前一位的化妝藝術，除了「有目共賞」，前無古人的千面人郎却乃之外，卡洛夫却確是還没發現同樣的一個「後之來者」，末一位在好蘭塢有「大塊蛋」Big　Bad　Bela之稱，當然也要有他的特殊形容惡人的長處。</p>
<p>可是在這「黑貓」裏，雖然是「兩美具」「二難并」，可是除了給我們聽了些慘虐的呼聲，和看了些殺人的藝術而外，並無其他的好處，並且懷疑到在這樣的世界裏，竟還有像哈葛德小説中所描寫的那些宗教裏殺人的祭禮。</p>
<p>劇本爲了廻護着「弄死人」也的道理，所以不得不弄出一些祭禮的花樣，這樣纔可以造成許多恐怖的塲面，本來恐怖片是脱不了這些窠臼的，不過這片子的佈局也太不進化了，因了竭力想增加這奇突和凄厲的力量，倒反教人看了並不能「毛骨悚然」。</p>
<p>對於情節上既如上述，那末也無非看看這兩位怪人又在作什麽怪罷了。卡洛夫自有他的老套，裴拉也不見有何特長，在兩人相打時候的動作，笨得不像真打。佈景是很利用些圖案立體的新式建築，我們想不到在看神秘片中，可以領略裝修學。</p>
<p>本來好蘭塢的製片商就「派别井然」，像華納以社會短劇和古典派見長，米高梅以近代寫實的一類片子號召，柯倫比亞是音樂歌舞片的能手，而聯美又是以美術同文藝的作風片著名，其餘的「等而下之」，要算環球的「浮而不實」，「大而不當」的片子爲最多。聽説這片的賣座很好，因此聯想到劍俠小説流行的時候，確是有人去「棄家訪道」和從窗口裏「騰雲」跳下去跌死的人。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c237">「閨怨」的我見 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 尼克</p>
<p>這是一張根據文藝作品改編的一齣戲，所以要用另一種看法來説説它。</p>
<p>大凡没文學著作方面改編而成的影片，不外以情節的編製，人物的描寫，來成功另一作風。關於前者如囂俄，大小仲馬氏的小説都是。而後一類如狄根司的小説，又如『小婦人』這一類都是。前者編成電影，自然是格外容易煊染得動看，而後都便充其量的編到十二分好處，也不過是看看各演員的表情動作而已，能彀演出來有『慷慨激昻』，或是『纒綿悱惻』，以至於令人有『啼笑皆非』的感覺，也可以説是很好的成績了。</p>
<p>我們如果去看的戲，劇本是從我們素來知道的某書或某故事或某小説改編而成的，那末我們在未看前先有了一種成見和希望，那末，這一類的戲，雖能轟動一時，但因爲成見人人不同，希望滿足的程度也不能一致，於是欣賞一方面，就打了折頭了。</p>
<p>這齣『閨怨』據我看也僅是人物描寫的一些技巧而已，從瑙瑪希拉起到瑪琳沙利文止，在揣摩當時人的動作個性上，有很大的成功，並且都相當的賣力。</p>
<p>這裏有和『小婦人』大致相類的作風，可是『小婦人』充滿了『和氣致祥』的色調，而這裏是處處『肅殺』而『凄厲』。但是『不求甚解』和取樂的觀衆，對於本片是未必能滿足的。</p>
<h3 id="c238">「麥夫人」將公映 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 火</p>
<p>張石川導演，胡蝶與舞國名姝梁氏姊妹主演的「麥夫人」，是一張全部對白歌唱聲片。這兒有波浪形的故事和刺激性的描寫，還有趣味的粤劇穿插：計有謝醒農，陳錦棠合演的「璇宫艷史」，曾三多，謝醒農，馮小非合演的「冰山火綫」與「天姬大送子」，胡蝶第一次在銀幕上和挂各揚主演的「皇姑嫁何人」，全片充滿了幽柔的南國情調，洋溢着美妙的浪漫氣息。演員值得介紹的有粤籍小生胡藝星他是明星公司的基本演員，雖然在銀還未成名，但在這兒那英俊爽颯的表情，顯然地他的前途是未可限量的。梁氏姊妹賽珠，賽姗，這一對嬌憨的南國麗人，也在本片中出現了，雖初上鏡頭，但表演的成績，也有意外的成功。本片不日在新光大戲院公映。（却）</p>

<p>阿華每月所掙到的工錢是很有限的還不足維持一家人的生活哩。所幸他們每天能賣出一些花，藉以補足家用。可是近來因爲受了都市不景氣的影響，花的銷路也因之而受了打擊，甚至於一天賣不出一朶花。</p>
<p>有一天早晨，小華娘又照例的携着一籃剛從園中採下來的鮮花到花市裏兜售，但很不幸的又没有把花賣去。她憂急的徘徊在飛花村車站的臨近處，適巧被站長看見了，他見了她那一種眣麗的風姿，不禁砰然心動，於是在第二天乘阿華不在家時到了她的家裏，但因爲阿華的父親在家，他没有敢做出放肆的舉動，僅向她抛了一個瞇眼，給了小華一枚銀元而去。</p>
<p>是一個狂風暴雨雷電施威的恐怖之夜，阿華父親的老病突然的轉劇，從他呼吸的短促：眼向上眨的形像中，已告訴了人他就將離開人間了。小華娘見到這可怖的景象，急忙的冒着雨在黑夜裏奔到車站，要求站長允許阿華馬上回來，但阿華適被總站調到另一地叚開兵車去了，四五天後才能回來。</p>
<p>小華娘得到了這個消息時，他急得眼眶中的淚水像斷綫似的流着。聰明的站長見是機會到了：也很慷慨地從衣袋中掬出一疊鈔票給她：「這小事，我先借一點錢給你好了」。小華娘感激的拿着錢飛也似的奔了回來。然而年老的公公，已等不及她的回來而瞑目長逝了！</p>
<p>幾天以後，阿華回來，他一踏進家門看見父親的靈位時，他是號啕大哭得幾乎昏絶過去。待小娘告訴他喪費是站長借給的時候，阿華不禁勃然大怒：他責小華娘不應該向這種壞人去借錢。</p>
<p>阿華父親的死，自然給站長很大的便利，在阿華一不在家時，站長便偷偷的跑了來，而且每次都帶了很多東西送給她。小華娘的意志，便在站長的物質與獻慇懃的兩重誘惑下摇動了。又終於在某一天的早晨，她受了站長的甜言蜜語的麻醉，乘小華熟睡的當兒，隨着站長到上海去了。他們到了上海，游遍了許多熱鬧的塲所，買了很多的時髦衣服。</p>
<p>到了晚上，站長把她哄騙到旅館裏去，將她灌醉了，而達到了他蹂躪女性的目的。（未完）</p>

<p>Tan Zhen Reports on Impressions of Judicial Inspection</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Government held its 158th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 26th. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Lin Sen, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu, Tan Zhen, Deng Jiayan, Li Zonghuang, Jiao Yitang, and all staff members, totaling over six hundred people. Chen Guofu presided over the meeting, and Tan Zhen gave a report. He stated that he was dispatched to foreign countries to inspect the judiciary for several months, covering dozens of countries, and inspected the judicial systems of various countries. Because of social stability, the judicial systems in countries like England and France are on the right track. Countries like Italy and Germany have undergone significant changes due to their unique environments, but the people's actions regarding social conditions are consistent, which is admirable. However, when in Germany, a professor at the University of Berlin asked whether the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People was included in the Civil Code of our country. Upon hearing this, I had many thoughts. In fact, our country's laws, from the founding of the Republic of China to the present, have mostly been copied and imitated, and have not been suitable for the national conditions, nor have they contained the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. It can be said that they only have a shell. A fundamental reform should be made to include the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People in the law. I hope that all comrades will no longer be perfunctory and should work together with revolutionary means. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Future of Anglo-American Cooperation <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of naval reduction, I sincerely hope for Anglo-American cooperation. I have already discussed this in detail in previous articles. According to recent foreign dispatches, there is already a tendency in this direction in the attitudes of British and American authorities. For example, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the British Conservative Party, on the one hand, hopes that the United States will join the League of Nations soon; on the other hand, he advocates that the actions of the British Navy should be shifted in accordance with the attitude of the United States. The implication is that Britain's wavering attitude today is actually influenced by the United States. At the same time, the British Foreign Office has formally denied the rumors of a non-aggression treaty between Britain and Japan. As for Washington, it has repeatedly expressed its views on this point in recent days, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull's conversation with reporters is particularly clear. Judging from this, the Anglo-American cooperation that we have been hoping for has now begun to show its signs. If Japan is determined to abolish the treaty, Britain and the United States, in order to maintain the balance of power in the Far East, will have no choice but to cooperate.</p>
<p>For a month, the ambiguous attitude of Britain has made the trend of naval reduction talks obscure and difficult to understand. However, as of today, the attitudes of Britain, the United States, and Japan towards naval reduction have become clear again. Japan's position is entirely based on equality of armaments, while the attitudes of Britain and the United States are still to maintain the Washington Naval Treaty. Britain's ambiguous attitude before, without immediately expressing a clear position, was probably intended to determine the true intentions of the United States and Japan in order to prepare to determine its own policy. Now, judging from Baldwin's words, we know that if the United States can truly be unyielding towards Japan and prepare to maintain the naval treaty by force, then the British Navy will also cooperate with the United States. From this, we can judge that the British attitude towards Japan in the past was mostly of a "hypocritical" nature and not truly affectionate towards Japan.</p>
<p>Now that the attitudes of Britain and the United States have gradually become clear, the future development will naturally be nothing more than two paths: (1) Japan yields and makes concessions; (2) Japan refuses to yield and resolutely resists the pressure from Britain and the United States. According to yesterday's Dongdian observations, Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty will not change slightly due to the joint opposition of Britain and the United States. The policy it has adopted is already very clear. In other words, Japan is already prepared to resist the joint pressure from Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Given the development of the naval reduction negotiations, there are several things that the Chinese people should pay attention to: (1) The significance of Anglo-American cooperation for our country; (2) The time frame for Britain and the United States to exert real pressure on Japan; (3) Our country's preparations. Some Chinese people believe that Anglo-American cooperation is extremely good news, thinking that all of Japan's aggressive actions against us can be corrected by this. Others believe that Anglo-American cooperation is purely for their own benefit, and if Japan were to submit, the pressure from Britain and the United States on us might not be different from that of Japan. Both of these attitudes seem excessive. The former is overly optimistic, and the latter is too pessimistic. In fact, if Britain and the United States can truly cooperate to exert real pressure on Japan, no matter what, it can at least slightly curb the ambitions of militarism. Moreover, Britain and the United States themselves have contradictions and opposing points, making it difficult to be consistent everywhere.</p>
<p>As for the timing of exerting real pressure on Japan and our future preparations, there is also a close relationship. Based on the situation, it will take at least five years. The reasons for this are as follows: (1) The disputes in Europe have become increasingly complex since the Marseille Massacre. It is impossible to resolve the European situation in the short term. If the European situation is not settled, the British Navy cannot boldly move east to support the American fleet. (2) The British Singapore naval base must be completed by the end of 1938. (3) The American Vinson Naval Construction Plan must also be completed in 1939. (4) After declaring the abolition of the treaty, Japan will also do its best to build warships in response to future events. Therefore, in the short term, Britain's ability to intervene in Far Eastern affairs is still constrained, and the American Navy also needs to be expanded. All of this is clearly visible in the situation.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Real Pressure on Japan Cannot Be Realized Immediately.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we must be prepared for the arrival of this event. A country on earth must first have its own way of survival before it can talk about taking advantage of the diplomatic situation. Therefore, today's national defense should be arranged with all our strength. As for international assistance, it is secondary.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Philippine National Defense Plan <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Cultivating Aviation Talents and Organizing the Army</p>
<p>Complete Independence in Fourteen Years</p>
<p>[Manila] Filipinos anticipate that a republican government will soon be established and complete independence will be obtained. They are now engaged in a national defense plan in preparation for the implementation of the independence plan and to obtain the necessary guarantees. The Constitutional Assembly, which closed on November 8, passed a bill stipulating the establishment of a National Defense Bureau. The parliament also stipulated an increase in police force and the establishment of a police air defense force as the basis for the future organization of the army on the island. This plan will be accepted by Philippine Governor-General Murphy. After its approval, it will become law. The National Defense Act stipulates an implementation fund of 102,800 yuan and stipulates that students will be sent to the U.S. Army School for study. A total of 20 people will be sent to West Point, 12 to Annapolis, and 12 to other flight schools. The plan sets a 14-year plan with a total cost of 2 million yuan. It is estimated that when the island becomes fully independent in 14 years, there will be 420 Philippine military officers with military knowledge to lead the Philippine army. In addition, there are 6,500 officers and men of the Philippine Detective Team and the Philippine Police Supplementary Detective Team, and 6,000 policemen. Another bill allocates 512,500 yuan to expand the police force, adding 1,800 policemen and police officers. The police expenses stipulated in the budget are 1,750,000 yuan. In addition, 250,000 yuan is designated as the cost of a police air force of ten aircraft and 120 pilots. There is currently no air force in the police, and there are very few police officers with flight experience. (November 26, National Electric)</p>

<p>A Clear Expression After Anglo-American Understanding</p>
<p>Political Issues Definitely Raised in Naval Talks</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources today, British Foreign Secretary Simon has solemnly declared to Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and Japanese naval representative Yamamoto that issues such as China's territorial integrity should be taken into consideration at all times. This is the basis of Britain's Far Eastern policy and cannot be separated. The British Foreign Secretary has notified Japan in firm and clear terms. Observers here believe that the British Foreign Office's re-declaration of its policy is the result of the recent Anglo-American understanding, and it is also heard that American envoy Davis will also advise Ambassador Matsudaira on the U.S. government's concern for maintaining the open door policy and continuing to recognize China's territorial integrity, and China's concerns have also been dispelled by Foreign Secretary Simon's statement. (November 25, National Electric)</p>
<p>[London] When Foreign Secretary Simon met with Ambassador Matsudaira on the 21st, he raised the issue of China, saying that preserving China's territory is the foundation of Britain's Far Eastern policy and must not be changed. This policy was also stated during the Anglo-American talks on the 23rd and was endorsed by the United States. The U.S. will raise the issue of China's open door and territorial integrity, which are of utmost concern to the U.S., at the next U.S.-Japan talks. The reason why Britain and the United States have raised the issue of China is to reject Japan's request for equality. The trend is extremely noteworthy. (November 25, Dentsu Electric)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon announced in the House of Commons today that Japan has replied to Britain's protest against the oil monopoly in "Manchukuo" and has now ordered Ambassador Clive to reply. The British government is closely watching the issue but cannot make further announcements at this time. The Foreign Secretary denied the claim that Britain is acting alone on the matter and said that it is in close contact with the United States and the Netherlands. (November 26, Reuters Electric)</p>

<p>Japanese Side Denies Mentioning 5·4·4 Ratio</p>
<p>[London] During the meeting between the US General Representative Davis and the Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira this morning, they discussed the possible procedures for holding naval talks after Japan abolished the Washington Naval Treaty. This morning's meeting was the first informal discussion between the two countries' General Representatives. It is now expected that Japan will announce the abolition of the Washington Treaty on December 10. Some parties now feel that the abolition of the treaty will bring the naval talks to an end. It is heard that political issues were not mentioned during this morning's meeting, because Matsudaira stated that Japan's reply to the questions raised by Britain two weeks ago was not yet complete. These questions involve qualitative restrictions on naval forces, the non-construction of defensive works in territories in the Pacific, and mutual notification of warship construction procedures. According to Matsudaira, he is still awaiting instructions from the government regarding the non-construction of defensive works in territories in the Pacific. Matsudaira officially assured Davis that there is no basis for the rumor that Japan proposed a 5·4·4 ratio for the navy to Britain. People in London now feel that if the naval talks turn to political aspects, Japan will definitely be asked about China's territorial integrity and the open door. However, this question will not be raised until Matsudaira expresses the policy shown in the new instructions. Duke of Connaught will marry Princess Helena on Thursday. Parliament will debate national defense on Wednesday, so naval representatives will not continue the talks before Friday. (November 26, Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>[London] The US Chief Representative to the Naval Talks, Davis, met with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Matsudaira, this morning for an hour. According to the recent declaration by Yamamoto, the Japanese Chief Specialist Commissioner of the Navy, the naval issue has now reached the stage of discussing specific aspects. However, this morning's US-Japan talks did not seem to confirm Yamamoto's declaration. At the beginning of the talks, Ambassador Matsudaira first stated to Davis that the Japanese representative had not intended to acknowledge the British Navy's superiority to establish an agreement, and had not made such a proposal to Britain. In other words, Matsudaira has denied the outside world's rumors that Japan is preparing to establish a naval treaty based on the ratio of 5 for Britain, 4 for the United States, and 4 for Japan. However, since the strictness of Japan's proposed claims has been fully understood, the comfort that Matsudaira gave Davis in this morning's meeting was just diplomatic rhetoric. Therefore, the talks tonight were not limited to this point. Matsudaira also tried to convince Davis that Japan had not made a detailed reply to Britain's reconciliation plan, especially to the clause in the British proposal that certain provisions of the Washington Treaty should be retained after its abolition. Japan did not make a detailed reply to this statement, which probably refers to Article 19 of the Washington Treaty regarding the non-addition of defensive works in the Pacific. In short, Matsudaira has at least assured Davis from a procedural point of view that the door to negotiations is still open. The second part of the talks was about the outlook for the future after the abolition of the Washington Treaty, since the abolition of the Washington Treaty is a foregone conclusion. However, it seems that neither the Japanese nor the American representatives have reached any conclusions on this level. (November 26, Havas Electric)</p>

<p>[Tokyo] Former Minister of the Army Sadao Araki gave a radio address on the 26th entitled "The Naval Disarmament Conference and the Standpoint of the Japanese Empire," using his qualifications as an army general to discuss naval issues, clarify the unity of army and navy defense, and promote national awareness of national defense. He briefly stated that even if Japan is in an isolated position, it must be willing to deal with national difficulties. (November 26, Japanese United Electric)</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Naval Conference is Gradually Becoming More Complex <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Both Political and Substantive Issues are Raised</p>
<p>[London] The London Naval Preparatory Conference has been going on for a month, and the time for Japan to notify the abolition of the Washington Treaty is gradually approaching. It has now reached the crossroads of success or failure. The private meeting between Matsudaira and Davis held this week was the first private meeting between Japan and the United States. Because the negotiations are at a major turning point, they have become the focus of attention from all parties. The US attitude remains tough, clearly distinguishing between equality of naval power and equality of national defense security. Because of the fear that Japan's acquisition of equality of naval power will undermine the sense of national defense security, it resolutely maintains the current naval ratio system. Therefore, it is not permissible to be optimistic about the outcome of the US-Japan private meeting. At present, there are only three ways to break the situation, namely: (1) Gradually increase the Japanese ratio within a certain period to achieve equality; (2) Gradually reduce the naval power of Britain and the United States to achieve equality at a lower level than the current level; (3) Start discussing the issue of qualitative restrictions. Regarding the above three methods, Representative Yamamoto's compromise proposal is highly anticipated and hoped for. The agenda guiding the talks this week will likely not go beyond the scope of the deadline for achieving equality and the issue of qualitative restrictions. Since the beginning, the preparatory conference has gradually changed from a one-dimensional negotiation centered on the issue of heavy restrictions to a complex, multi-dimensional situation involving qualitative and political issues.

<p>Still Says the Manchuria Issue Should be Excluded</p>
<p>[Tokyo] There is a trend towards introducing political issues into the London Preparatory Conference. However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that it has not yet received any specific expressions from Britain and the United States regarding this matter. At a time when Japan's attitude is firm and unwavering, this proves that Britain and the United States lack confidence. When the Japanese government agreed to participate in the preparatory conference, the fact that East Asian political issues would not be introduced had been confirmed by Britain and the United States. It is unbelievable that Britain and the United States would propose discussions at this time. However, although the Japanese government opposes discussing the China issue and the Manchuria issue, it also expresses its support for discussing political issues that can establish the principle of peace and non-war between Britain, the United States, and Japan, and achieve the goal of maintaining world peace, so that naval negotiations can be successfully concluded. In addition, the Japanese government is convinced that Japan's disarmament plan is fair and appropriate, so the Japanese side has no intention of raising this type of political issue. (November 26, Dentsu Electric)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The theory of establishing a new treaty at the Guandong Naval Preparatory Conference is gradually gaining traction. Countries are considering this issue with the expansion and strengthening of the Four-Power Treaty as the center. Therefore, there is currently a proposal to extend the validity period of the Four-Power Treaty by ten years in order to realize the new treaty. The procedure for extending the validity period of the Four-Power Treaty is not complicated and is easily agreed upon by various countries. Japan has no objection to the issue of extension.

<p>[Washington] People in Europe and the United States now regard Soviet Russia as the backbone in the event of a war in Europe and Asia. The US government wants to quickly resolve the loan negotiations with Russia to increase Soviet Russia's military and economic strength. Responsible parties believe that since Japan is determined to abolish the naval treaty, the Nine-Power Pact and the Four-Power Treaty will be torn up. The navy and diplomacy are thinking about ways to guarantee peace. The government's current focus is on maintaining the political status quo to await the clarification of the world's economic situation and naval issues. Although officials here deny that the issue of the status of Soviet Russia was considered during the current negotiations, fair responsible authorities believe that this is an inevitable result. (November 25, National Electric)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US-Russian debt issue will soon be effectively resolved when US Ambassador to Russia Bullitt and Russian Ambassador to the US Troyanovsky meet in Washington. The US Ambassador will arrive here before the Russian Ambassador returns to office. It has been tentatively decided that the two will hold talks with President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Hull at that time. Some observers believe that the two countries may renegotiate loans to Russia to revive American heavy industry and temporarily shelve the old debt issue that is currently stalled. Industry leader Cooper said today that it is very foolish for American businessmen not to invest in Russia's huge trade, and said, "It is generally known that both countries will benefit greatly after this issue is resolved, but it is still delayed. I really don't know why." Officials of the Soviet Russian trade agency Amtorg Trading Corporation also said today that Russia can ship 45,000 tons of raw gold to the US within a year. Soviet Russia can earn 6 million US dollars from this, and the new US-Russian loan can be used to pay interest. Therefore, commercial relations will definitely develop. Some American engineers also said that Russia's gold mines are inexhaustible, especially in Siberia. (November 25, National Electric)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The close cooperation between France and Soviet Russia can be seen from the news of the judges, because the two countries will continue their active diplomatic activities.

At the same time, French Ambassador to Russia Herfant is also conducting negotiations with the Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Committee and former Soviet Russian diplomat Arosev in Moscow.

On November 18, two female passengers, one Soviet, Labogun, and one Swiss, Maga, and a railway guide, Soviet, Gadet, were beaten by Japanese soldiers when they wanted to pass through the lane where the Japanese guards were sitting on their way to the dining car when they arrived in Harbin. The Japanese army continued to seize all the buildings owned by the railway. On November 19, four armed Japanese soldiers forcibly occupied the residences of road workers Vaher and Oblestov at Shuangchengpao Station and threw their furniture onto the street. On November 18, Japanese police forcibly drove railway supervisor Deman Lunbai out of his residence at Suifenhe Station and forcibly occupied many road workers' residences. On November 16, Japanese troops, under the command of officers, moved all the materials and machinery in the Chinese Eastern Railway Leather Factory, regardless of the factory's protest, and drove the factory's employees out. The factory immediately organized a committee to be responsible for the safekeeping of the remaining property of the factory and to estimate the amount of losses on the spot. Japanese officers did not allow them to enter. The director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, Roti, has written to the director of the Japanese army group, making a firm protest against the extortionate actions of the Japanese officers, and stating that all the losses caused by such actions by the Japanese officers will be added to the amount owed by the Japanese army to the railway.

<p>Cooperation Between the Government and the Financial Industry</p>
<p>Striving to Save the Economic Panic</p>
<p>The Debt Raising Method is Quite Clever</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the situation here today, President Roosevelt has trended towards liberalism. Observers, because business leaders wanted to know what the President's attitude was, said that judging from the President's measures in recent months, it can be seen that the "New Deal" has trended towards moderation. The impetus for radical change has been shifted by the conservative trend. The most radical action by the government at present is the attack on public utilities, such as the investigation of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Although the company's employees said that they had no secrets and therefore welcomed the investigation, Wall Street believed that this was a hostile action by the government, because the result may lead to a reduction in the general public utility fees. As for the President's current conservative moves, there are about the following items:</p>
<p>(1) The government's way of changing the value of the dollar will no longer change; (2) Encourage bankers and business leaders to participate in the government's revival movement; (3) Oppose the silver act again.</p>
<p>The connection between the government and large merchants is also regarded as the most important development in Washington in recent months. Bankers, industrialists, and financiers have all expressed their cooperation with the President. For several weeks, the President has been listening to the various suggestions of the large industrialists, preparing to fight the economic panic again. Some observers believe that the large merchants' entry and exit of the White House is a sign of the temporary loss of power of the "brain trust," but those who are friendly to the government laugh it off.

Since March 1 last year, although the total amount of public debt has increased by 29 percent, the total amount of interest has only increased by 14.7 percent. (November 25, National News Agency)</p>

This burial is on the verge of abolishing the mine. The workers of the whole mine have lost their way and will cause major social problems. 300 victim families rushed to the scene. Fathers cried for their sons and wives cried for their husbands. It was extremely tragic and absorbed the sympathy of all parties. However, there is no hope of rescuing the 50 or so victims. It is impossible to predict how long it will take to restore the entire mine. The damage is great. (November 26, Dentsu Electric)</p>

<p>Okada Flustered in Selecting Successor</p>
<p>No Impact Expected on Financial Circles</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Finance Minister Fujii, due to the worsening of his illness, has decided to resign. Vice Minister Hoshima carried Finance Minister Fujii's letter of resignation at 3:40 PM and visited Prime Minister Okada to hand it over. Regarding the Finance Minister's illness, it is a severe case of catarrhal bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and pyothorax. The condition announced at 3:00 PM included a respiratory rate of 25, a normal body temperature, a pulse of 90, and extreme fatigue. (December 26th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Finance Minister Fujii, who was initially scheduled to deliver a speech on financial issues at the provisional parliament convened tomorrow, will be unable to attend due to his severe illness. However, if the Finance Minister's condition proves to be permanently debilitating, the government must urgently consider a successor. Therefore, Prime Minister Okada is deeply considering the progression of Finance Minister Fujii's illness and his potential successor. Furthermore, if a replacement of the Finance Minister becomes necessary, the possibility of Commerce Minister Machida succeeding him is considered to be the most likely. (December 26th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Governor of the Bank of Japan, Hijikata, made the following remarks regarding the impact of Finance Minister Fujii's resignation due to illness on financial circles:</p>
<p>Finance Minister Fujii's sudden resignation due to illness is quite astonishing. However, the fixed financial policy of the current cabinet is unlikely to change abruptly as a result. Moreover, the budget for the next fiscal year has already been finalized and was established yesterday. Therefore, financial circles are unlikely to be affected. Stock trading on the 26th also did not experience any significant fluctuations. However, I sincerely sympathize with the Finance Minister for resigning midway through his term due to illness.

<p>Elder Statesman Yamamoto of the Seiyukai Takes the Front Line</p>
<p>Will Lash Out at the Government on Disarmament Issues</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government, in a cabinet meeting on the 24th, decided on the content of speeches to be given by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at the provisional parliament, as well as various other matters, in preparation for parliamentary countermeasures. According to government observations, even in the worst-case scenario in the provisional parliament, a motion of no confidence is unlikely to be introduced. However, issues that may arise in the ordinary parliament include: (1) the tax increase problem; (2) the merits and demerits of Fujii's financial policies; (3) the army pamphlet problem; (4) the budget problem for next year; and (5) rural relief and the cultural revolution issue in the Manchurian resident agency. (December 26th, Japan League News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai Party has decided to fully criticize the government in the provisional parliament. Regarding the lack of effective and sincere measures for rural relief, and the disciplinary issues related to the reform of agencies in Manchuria, they have decided to take an independent stance, without any leniency, and strictly criticize the government. However, they have decided to continue their friendly relationship with the Minseito Party, taking a coordinated and amicable approach to achieve concrete cooperation. Yamamoto Teijiro will clarify the party's beliefs regarding disarmament issues. At the same time, the Seiyukai and Minseito will jointly submit a resolution regarding treaty abolition and demands for military equality, so that the national consensus on disarmament can be reflected in the provisional parliament, and use it to lash out at the government.

<p>Seeking to Save the Nation Through Constitutionalism</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The joint statement of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties was released at 3:30 PM. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>Our domestic and international situation is truly in a worrying and difficult state. As we face these eventful times, parliamentary politics based on the great principle of constitutionalism, and political parties rooted in the will of the people, have an even greater importance in their operation and responsibility. This is self-evident. In this serious period, political parties should also aim high and proceed on a grand scale. They should liquidate past emotional responses and other handling methods, and completely eliminate narrow partisan habits. There should be no debate about the need to strictly abolish the struggle for political power. From now on, we should sincerely share the hardships, work together with one heart, and strive to overcome the national crisis. This cooperation between the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, devoting ourselves to the country, stems from this purpose, and its motive should be absolutely pure. The attitude should be consistently reasonable. On the basis of national unity, the two parties will work together to establish appropriate national policies in order to save the nation from its difficulties and alleviate the suffering of the people. There is no other way to do this. (December 26th, Japan League News)</p>

It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is extremely anxious about Italy's foreign trade deficit and the budget shortfall. He is eager to protect the Italian currency to avoid being forced to abandon the gold standard before other gold-using countries.

According to him, the cotton seeds in Shanzhou and Anyang counties in Henan Province were originally selected by me in Shanghai as good seeds and distributed to cotton farmers for planting. After several years, there has been progress compared to before. In recent years, Hebei Province has the best cotton production in China, but the annual demand of various yarn factories is still insufficient, so it is necessary to purchase foreign cotton. I only hope that the Chinese people will actively expand cotton fields, improve seeds, and increase domestic cotton to resist the intrusion of foreign cotton. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>[Xiamen] The Taiwan Industrial Inspection Group, led by Chen Ticheng, Director of the Construction Department, a group of twenty-two people, returned by ship from Keelung on the Guangdong Maru and arrived in Xiamen on the morning of the 26th. Wang Guipan, Director of the Special Public Security Bureau, and various organizations boarded the ship to welcome them. Tsukamoto Takeshi, the Japanese Consul, received a telegram from the Governor of Taiwan and also boarded the ship to welcome them with great enthusiasm. They stayed at the Tianxian Hotel. Wang hosted a banquet at Nanputuo Temple at noon. From 4 to 6 p.m., the Japanese Consul held a tea party to welcome them. In the evening, the various bus companies in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen hosted a banquet. Chen said that the Taiwan Governor's Office provided excellent hospitality for this inspection, and all technical agencies were able to sincerely provide guidance. Taiwan has been under Japanese rule for nearly forty years. Because its administration is a colonial style, the government has great power, so policies are easy to implement, and current construction is very successful, especially in agriculture and water conservancy. The products of sugarcane are the most abundant. Afforestation and trial planting of Fuzhou fir from Fujian have been effective. There is very little wasteland. Eighty percent of the land in Taiwan is government-owned, and twenty percent is privately owned. Because the bay industry is developed and there is a surplus of capital, they are striving to find outlets in Fujian Province. This group's inspection focuses on agriculture and water conservancy. After returning, they will formulate a concrete plan and gradually implement it after one year. They plan to afforest in western Fujian and manage water in eastern Fujian to open up paddy fields, etc. The Taiwan Governor's Office welcomed this trip very warmly, and the Japanese are extremely keen to make connections. The Xiamen Daily published an editorial on the 26th strongly advocating friendship. However, the group declared in Taiwan that it was purely technical and did not involve politics.

<p>The Pseudo-Army Occupies Important Towns and Villages</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Among the counties in the war zone, Yutian is the most chaotic recently. The number of bandits is almost uncountable. Almost every village and town in the county has bandits, and there is almost no village where robbery does not occur every day. The strength of the local militia is only enough to defend the outskirts of the county and block large groups of bandits from entering, but the bandits lurking within the territory are like rats gnawing and insects eating away from the inside, and there is no power to suppress them. The former County Magistrate, Chen Baosheng, was transferred to the province due to the Gong Yue case, awaiting another appointment. The newly appointed County Magistrate, Huang Zhongkai, although he has taken office, is controlled by the Security Reinforcement Team, and government orders are not implemented. He only flatters the Security Team to protect himself. Recently, the areas occupied by bandits include Fengwu Town, bordering Fengrun and Yutian, with about six or seven hundred people. They actually control the post and telecommunications, block traffic, and issue orders to nearby villages. Lin Cangnan Town is also occupied by more than a hundred bandits, who go out dozens of miles during the day to rob villages. These bandits all avoid calling themselves bandits, claiming to be a certain detachment or brigade of the Pseudo-East Asia Alliance Army of Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang, or a certain regiment headquarters, brigade headquarters, or detachment headquarters. The people of Yutian are deaf and blind because the traffic is controlled by bandits, and they cannot distinguish the authenticity of these bandit troops. Those who have the strength to escape move elsewhere, and those who do not have the strength to move far away are left to be slaughtered by the bandits. Although the authorities are well aware of the situation here, they cannot send troops to suppress them due to the limitations of the war zone, and the situation is also extremely complicated, which cannot be resolved by simple military action.

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London Gold Price: Today's listed price is 139 shillings and 6 pence, 1 pence higher than Saturday.</p>
<p>London Silver: The silver market was stable today. Speculators bought in the morning, and there were not many suppliers. The spot price is 24.5 pence, and the futures price is 24.625 pence, both up 0.0625.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate</p>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market was quiet this morning. After the authorities initially used the stabilization fund to adjust the exchange market, there were fewer and fewer transactions. The pound sterling showed a weak trend against gold coins and against the US dollar. The opening price of the US exchange rate was 4 US dollars and 99 cents, 1.25 lower than the closing exchange rate between the US and the UK on Saturday. It continued to decline slightly in the morning, but the number was very small. At 1 p.m., the price was 4 US dollars and 98 cents 5625, 4375 lower than the opening price, but it rose 0.0625 at 2 p.m., reaching 4 US dollars and 98 cents 625.</p>
<p>British-French: The trend of the franc is the same as that of the US dollar. The opening price was unchanged, at 75 francs 71. It fell 12 points at 1 p.m., but rebounded 6 points at 2 p.m. The most recent price is 75 francs 65.</p>
<p>American-British: The opening exchange rate between the US and the UK in the New York foreign exchange market today was 4 US dollars and 98 cents 625, down by half a point. The French exchange rate was higher, with an opening price of 6 US dollars and 59 cents 25, 1.25 higher than the closing price on Saturday.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: The cotton market opened this morning, with prices up 6 points, and then rose slightly. Demand in Europe is strong, and transactions are smooth.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The wheat market opened with only slight changes, due to conflicting forces. However, the foundation of the wheat market is strong, and it is easy to rise at the first sign of good news.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market rose higher today. At 1 p.m., the price for December was 4 shillings and 9.125 pence, 0.875 higher than on Saturday.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market rose today. At 1 p.m., the price for January was 6.71, up 6 points.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The market was firm this morning. The transaction prices for January-March at noon were 6 pence 4375, 0.125 higher than the final price on Saturday.</p>
<p>New York: The market today followed the London market. The opening price was firm, up 10 points, and then continued to rise by 5 points. Sentiment is quite stable.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: Factors favorable to the market before the opening of securities were: (1) Commercial prospects and confidence are gradually increasing. Some expect steel mill activity to reach 40% of its production capacity soon, due to housing construction and demand from the automotive and railway industries. (2) Washington clearly intends to work closely with the business community to carry out a general revival plan. Unfavorable factors for the market were that although the securities market opened firm and was quite active, the gains were limited to small numbers. After the opening of securities today, steel stocks continued to be heavily traded. 3,800 shares of US Steel Corporation stock were traded at prices 0.625 higher than the closing price on Saturday. Market sentiment is good, and there are signs that the gains are expanding.</p>
<p>Hopseng &amp; Co. received a telegram from New York on the 26th stating that no foreign countries had issued bonds in the United States in the past four years, but this morning's news was that Finland is currently issuing 4% public bonds in the United States, totaling 10 million US dollars. The issue price is 101 US dollars and 50 cents for those due in 1936, and 97 US dollars for those due in 1939. It is heard that the proceeds of this bond will be used as a debt repayment fund.

<h3 id="e95">Prospects for the Japanese Extraordinary Diet <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Two Parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, will Fight Together</p>
<p>Budget Compilation Repeatedly Frustrated</p>
<p>In a constitutional political country, special attention is naturally paid to the parliament, because the parliament is the representative body of public opinion, urging the government to do all kinds of work required by the people. The recent parliament in Japan is still the sole legislative body, but in fact, most of the public does not seem to be very enthusiastic about it. Even political parties that specialize in political life do not have any performance that is sufficient to represent the public. On the contrary, the public is very indifferent to political parties, and seems to feel that the relationship is not close and does not hope that they can solve their problems in the parliament. The depression of political parties is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The Minseito is the party of the current government, but since the establishment of the Okada cabinet, except for the fact that its foreign policy has followed the previous policy without change and has not been criticized by the public, the rest has been unremarkable, and general public opinion has little favor. Therefore, although the Minseito is considered to be consistent with the government and should theoretically support the government's proposals, the Okada cabinet's lukewarm attitude towards the increase in taxes has aroused a lot of resentment. Even the discontented voices within the Minseito can be heard everywhere. The most obvious symbol is the joint movement of the Seiyukai and Minseito.</p>
<p>The work of cooperation between the Seiyukai and Minseito did not start today. Since the May 15th assassination of Inukai and the shake-up of parliamentary politics, every political season, someone has loudly advocated the movement for cooperation between political parties or a one-party system for the whole country, but none of them have had any effect. What's more, the Seiyukai has almost 300 members in the parliament, accounting for an absolute majority of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives. Even if the Minseito is added, it may not be useful.</p>
<p>The reason why this time the movement for cooperation between the two parties is relatively strong is, firstly, it is affected by the reform of the organization of institutions in "Manchuria", and secondly, it is stimulated by the booklet "The Essence of National Defense" issued by the military. Because the institutions in "Manchuria" were originally co-governed by civilian and military officials. In other words, they are capitalists and quite powerful managers. However, in recent years, they have not been very at ease with their investment in "Manchuria", and some people are even unwilling to invest new capital anymore, fearing that they will not be able to control it in the future and that safety is not sufficient. But after all, there is room for development there, and excess capital should be invested. However, they have long felt that it is inappropriate to transfer all political power to the military as it is now. The issue of the booklet issued by the military caused considerable resentment in the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, but they dared not express it because they were afraid of the power of the military. If the Seiyukai and Minseito can really unite, it may be easier to deal with. Moreover, since Wakatsuki Reijiro resigned as president of the Minseito, there is no one to head the party for a while, and the cooperation movement naturally feels necessary. Suzuki Kisaburo of the Seiyukai is not very enthusiastic about the union of the two parties, but on the one hand, there is Kusuhara Fusanosuke's "one-party system for the whole country," and on the other hand, there is Yamamoto Jotaro's "theory of supporting constitutional politics," and after Tokonami's entry into the cabinet, problems have arisen in the party's control, so Suzuki cannot but accommodate the proposal for the union of the Seiyukai and Minseito. However, it is doubtful whether the union can reach what extent, whether it can fight against the current government with a unified party, because supporting the constitution is, after all, an abstract and empty statement and cannot raise the spirit of union. Unless a general attack is launched on the Okada cabinet and the union is formed in the movement to overthrow the cabinet, it is only possible. Suzuki, as the leader of a purely opposition party, certainly supports this move, and the Kusuhara faction also generally agrees, but he intends to support Ugaki Kazushige as the president of the party or support General Minami Jiro as the prime minister of the cabinet. Yamamoto (Jotaro) does not seem to be very much in favor of actively overthrowing the cabinet. Although the Minseito also tends to the movement to overthrow the cabinet, it is not determined to immediately call on the cabinet members from the party to withdraw from the cabinet, but is only going around in circles on the issue of reform. In this case, the union movement will not only fail to unite on practical issues, but there is also a risk of separation.</p>
<p>The strength of the current cabinet itself was originally composed of the military, the bureaucracy, and political parties, and it is fundamentally difficult to be consistent. We see the disputes over the issue of the increased budget. The military's position naturally overrides everything. Although it has repeatedly made concessions now, the result is probably that military spending will account for 46% to 50% of the total national treasury expenditure. Other expenses, such as disaster relief, have also increased considerably, but compared with national defense spending, they are ultimately a minority. In fact, Finance Minister Fujii, who is close to financiers and industrial capital, cannot but take into account the current financial situation and cannot disobey the demands of the military. The result is that it is probably not the parliament that will overthrow the cabinet, but the contradictions contained within the cabinet itself. (November 22, 1934, Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Japanese Urgently Seek to Develop Gold Mines in Jehol <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Ten Major Gold Mountains Discovered in the Yinshan Mountains</p>
<p>The Most Extensive Coal Seams in the Congling Mountains</p>
<p>Chengde Correspondence: Jehol is mountainous, so it is rich in mineral resources. Along the Shanhaiguan border wall, far from Kaiping and Luanzhou in Hebei, between Shimenzhai Chaoyang Xinqiu, belonging to the Congling Mountains, there are extensive coal seams. From the Harqin to the Ongniut Banner and the Han tribes, belonging to the Yinshan Mountains, the Japanese have recently discovered "Ten Major Gold Mountains." The Japanese are now investigating and studying and planning to mine. The location and content of the gold mines are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Xindaba Gold Mountain, located in Xinqiu Nanli Yu, is embedded in granite. There are two gold-bearing quartz veins, one is 350 feet long and 1.5 to 5 feet wide, and the other is also 350 feet long and 2 to 3.5 feet wide, both containing gold at a rate of 2 to 8 parts per million and silver at a rate of 8 to 10 percent. (2) Xu Jiabei Man Gold Mountain, located 1.5 miles south of the Beizi Mansion in Beigushan, Chaoyang, has two quartz veins penetrating gneiss, one extending 500 meters and 2 inches to 1.3 feet wide, and the other extending 600 meters and 2 inches to 7 inches wide, which increases to 3 feet at the outcrop in the old pit. If the trace of the road to gold is obtained from the first two veins, the extension of the vein is very promising. (3) Shang Shelihu Gold Mountain, located 3 miles south of the Beizi Mansion in Gushan, has Baigu Matai Stone penetrating gneiss, with two quartz veins, one extending 500 meters and 1 to 4.5 feet wide, and the other extending 300 meters and the width is unknown, reportedly 4 to 5 feet. The gold content of the two veins is 3 parts per 100,000. The pit is currently full of water, so it has been suspended. There is great hope if a drainage machine is used. (4) Yangjiawanzi Gold Mountain, located 150 miles northeast of Jianping, has four quartz veins of Baigu Matai Stone penetrating gneiss, one 1,000 feet long and 1 to 4.5 feet wide, the second 800 feet long and 4.5 feet wide, the third 1,500 feet long and 1 to 3 feet wide, and the fourth 1,100 feet long and 5 inches wide. The gold content of the four veins is 3 to 6 parts per million, which is the most promising gold vein in Jehol. (5) Jinchanggouliang Gold Mountain, located 16 miles northwest of Chaoyang, has ten gold-bearing quartz veins embedded in gneiss, the largest being 700 meters long and 2 inches to 1 foot wide, containing gold at a rate of 2 to 8 parts per 100,000, but the vein is small, which is its shortcoming. (6) Lai Maozi Gold Mountain, located 1.5 miles east of Jinchanggouliang, has gold-bearing quartz veins embedded in coal and rock, with a number of veins ranging from one to five, the largest being 1,300 meters long and 1 inch to 7 feet wide, containing gold at a rate of 1 part per 10,000 to 2 parts per 100,000. (7) Xiao Changquan Gold Mountain, located 100 miles southeast of Jianping, has four quartz veins embedded in gneiss, the longest being 1,500 feet and the other five or six hundred feet, with a vein about one foot wide containing 2 to 8 parts per million. It is very promising if a drainage machine is installed. (8) Jiguan Mountain, located northeast of Chifeng Nan Harachili Prefecture, is filled in the gaps between Gang Stone or Hua Yan Banshi, mainly with quartz veins, containing gold at a rate of 2 to 10 parts per 100,000. (9) Nianzigou Gold Mountain, located 30 miles northwest of Chengde, has a simple quartz vein deposit of cloud stone, with three veins containing gold at a rate of 2 parts per 100,000, starting from 5 feet wide. (10) Luotuo Gou Gold Mountain, located about 25 miles northwest of Chengde, has a long-grown bed and is very promising. After checking that Jehol has been seized by the Japanese, the great mountains are no longer ours. I wonder what our people will think after hearing the news that the Japanese are mining gold in Jehol.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Members of the Mongolian Political Council Will Go South to Visit Chiang Kai-shek <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>To Thank Chairman Chiang for His Virtues and Comfort</p>
<p>To Submit a Report on the Recent Work of the Mongolian Political Council</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After Yun Duan Wangchuk, Chairman of the Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Council, and Demchugdongrub, Secretary-General, returned to the temple after meeting with Chairman Chiang in Suiyuan, they were deeply grateful for Chairman Chiang's virtues and comfort, so they appointed Bu Ying Dalai, Director of the Security Department of the Council, and Chen Shaowu to come to Beiping from the temple to prepare to go to Nanjing. In addition to meeting with Wang Jingwei, Shi Qingyang and other central figures to report on the work of the Council since its establishment, they also plan to go to Jiangxi Province to meet with Chairman Chiang on behalf of Yun and De to express their gratitude. After Bu Ying and his party arrived in Beiping, they were initially busy with socializing, so the date of departure was undecided. Then, at the insistence of the Mongolian compatriots in Beiping, they planned to convene a meeting of all compatriots to express their welcome and to present some public opinions of the compatriots in Beiping and ask Bu Ying et al. to forward them to Chairman Chiang for review. Later, due to other trivial matters, the date of departure was postponed again and again. As of today (the 24th), it is said that it has been set for 6:50 p.m. tomorrow (the 25th) to take the Pingpu train south, and it is planned to arrive before Chairman Chiang leaves Nanjing to avoid going to Jiangxi again.</p>
<p>The reasons for the delayed departure of Bu Ying Dalai and his party are roughly as mentioned above. Upon careful consideration, there are two reasons: (1) the selection of companions has not been determined; (2) the Mongolian compatriots in Beiping have made certain suggestions to Bu Ying Dalai regarding the missing Han Fenglin. Regarding the selection of companions, it was originally planned to invite Xiao Zhenying, a member of the military branch, to accompany them to provide leadership, but Xiao was ordered to accompany the Overseas Chinese Inspection Group to visit Chahar when they passed through Beiping, so he could not leave in a hurry. Bu Ying Dalai and others also postponed their trip south for this reason. Regarding the Han Fenglin incident among the compatriots in Beiping, after Chairman Chiang met with them in Beiping and promised to investigate the matter within one month, they expressed their gratitude in unison. When the representatives of Yun and De returned to Beiping, they held several meetings and formulated a letter of suggestion to Bu Ying Dalai et al., hoping that Bu Ying Dalai et al. would not make this trip in vain. Bu Ying Dalai et al. felt a great responsibility and had to consider it before leaving, so as not to disgrace their mission in both public and private matters.</p>
<p>Today (the 24th), Liang Zhixiang, a Mongolian compatriot in Beiping, told reporters that in addition to meeting Chairman Chiang and thanking him on behalf of Yun and De, Bu Ying Dalai et al. will also meet with the heads of various relevant ministries in the central government, submit a report on the work of the Mongolian Political Council since its establishment, and ask for instructions on everything. The compatriots in Beiping were previously panicked due to the disappearance of Han Fenglin, but in view of the difficult times for the country, they did not dare to make any expressions other than waiting for the government to investigate the matter thoroughly. Taking advantage of Bu Ying Dalai's visit to Nanjing, the compatriots in Beiping specially appointed Bu Ying Dalai as the representative of the compatriots and attached a statement when meeting Chairman Chiang, so that the whereabouts of Han Fenglin would be revealed as soon as possible to dispel doubts, etc. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Success of the Fifth Encirclement Campaign: Huichang is Completely Recovered <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>There are No More Bandit Areas in Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>Scattered Bandits in the Four Townships are Awaiting Suppression</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Huichang is the gateway for southeastern Jiangxi to Fujian and Guangdong, bordering Ruijin to the north, Xunwu to the south, Yudu and Anyuan to the west, and Wuping in Fujian and Pingyuan in Guangdong to the east. It is also the key point of the bandit areas of the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. The throat of Huichang connecting Fujian and Guangdong is at Yunmenling. Before sea transportation was available, it was the hub for trade in the border areas of the three provinces. There was a customs office, and the terrain was dangerous, making it a must for military competition. In the past, the Red Army's strategy was to defend against Guangdong and attack Jiangxi and Fujian, that is, to defend Guangdong with Huichang Yunmenling and consolidate the rear of its pseudo-central government. Ye Jianying led the troops directly under the pseudo-central government, such as students from the Red Army School, the Pseudo-Guard Division, the First Supplementary Division, and Chen Yi and other forces in the Pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Military Region, and deployed them in the Yunmenling area, building solid fortifications to defend to the death. The Zhu-Mao pseudo-1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th pseudo-army groups were able to harass eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian with peace of mind, which shows the importance of its relationship. The Fifth Encirclement Campaign by the National Army used the Southern Route Army to attack Yunmen, directly attacking the heart of the pseudo-central government to destroy the bandits. If Huichang could have been captured earlier, the encirclement campaign could have ended earlier. However, when the Northern Route Army captured Shicheng and the Eastern Route Army captured Tingzhou, and the Red Army fled west with all its strength, the Southern Route Army was unable to advance on Huichang according to the planned plan due to fierce battles in Xinfeng, Dayu, and Nankang. The plan was changed, and the Eastern Route Army took Ruijin Huichang from east to west. According to publicly released news, after Li Yutang, Liu Kan and other troops advanced towards Huichang from Wuping and Shanghang, the pseudo-independent regiments, local guerrillas, and scattered bandits along the way were all defeated. On the 20th, they surrounded Huichang County. Seeing that the situation was not good, the remnant bandits abandoned the city and fled west. The Li Division then entered the county seat on the 23rd to handle the aftermath. Since 1927, Jiangxi has been shrouded in Red Terror. More than 20 of the 81 counties in the province (now Guangze in Fujian and Wuyuan in Anhui have been划赣共八十三 counties) were completely occupied by bandits. More than 20 counties guarded by the National Army existed in name only. More than 20 counties where bandits appeared and disappeared irregularly were trapped in the situation where bandits went when the army came and bandits came when the army left. The truly safe areas were only Nanchang, Xinjian, Jiujiang, Jinkou, and five or six other counties. As of the 17th of this month, under the gradual advancement of the National Army's steady encirclement and blockade, only Huichang County remained in the hands of bandits in all counties in the province. Now that Huichang has also been recovered, there are no longer any bandits occupying towns in Jiangxi. Only the scattered bandits in the newly recovered areas and the heavily bandit areas in the four townships urgently need to be suppressed and appeased. (November 24)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Salt Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel to Inspect Salt Affairs in Shaanxi Province <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Li Yujie Arrives in the Province, First Inspecting Guanzhong</p>
<p>Xi'an Correspondence: In order to coordinate and rectify salt affairs in various localities and increase salt tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance has dispatched commissioners to various provinces for inspection, in order to facilitate rectification. Li Yujie, the Shaanxi Province Salt Affairs Inspection Commissioner, arrived in the province some days ago and is staying at the Shaanxi Provincial Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Revenue Bureau. According to Li, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that since the second year of the Republic of China, when Yuan Shikai privately borrowed 20 million gold pounds from the Five-Nation Banking Consortium, using the national salt tax as collateral, all subsequent salt affairs in China have been subject to foreign supervision, resulting in the outflow of rights and interests and numerous loopholes, which has greatly harmed the national treasury and economy. Therefore, in October of last year, the Ministry of Finance established the Salt Affairs Inspection General Office, with branch offices established in various production areas and salt tax revenue bureaus established in sales areas, specializing in salt affairs and tax revenue matters, under the unified jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent foreigners from profiting from it. However, since the salt tax in various localities was placed under the management of the Ministry of Finance last year, active efforts have been made to rectify it. Now, in order to increase tax revenue, commissioners have been dispatched to various provinces for inspection. The revenue from salt tax in this province, in addition to the regular expenses of the tax bureau and the payment of foreign debt installments, has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to be allocated to the province's entire education fund, in order to expand education and cultivate talents. This time, I came to Shaanxi, have already met with Chairman Shao, and plan to contact various party and government organs in the coming days. I plan to inspect the inland area of Guanzhong first, and then proceed to the Hanzhong and Yulin areas. If there is an opportunity, I also plan to visit Lanzhou. (23rd)</p>

<p>Water Police Captain Captures Thief in Fengjing</p>
<p>Hu Tu, the captain of the Water Police Team stationed in Songjiang of the Provincial Public Security Team, recently received a secret report that the bandit Gu A'bu was recently discovered in Fengjing. He immediately dispatched patrol officer Gu Lansheng to lead a team to Fengjing to arrest him. Gu was indeed captured in the Xinhua Hotel in the town and taken back for interrogation. It is said that the criminal is from outside the North Gate of this county, 30 years old. He used to work in a certain restaurant in Fengjing. Later, because of his association with bad friends and his bad behavior, the owner, fearing that he would take excessive action, dismissed Gu. Since Gu lost his job, his life became more difficult, so he associated with bandits and committed crimes in the Fengjing area. After the government investigated, the criminal disappeared without a trace. Now, a informant saw him and reported to the team, so he was captured without resistance.</p>
<p>Extensive Establishment of Warehouses to Relieve Rural Areas</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered all counties to extensively establish warehouses in order to relieve rural areas. After receiving the order, this county consulted with the Farmers Bank and convened local gentry to discuss preparations. It has been decided to set up locations in Tinglin, Sijing, and Huayang Bridge. The Farmers Bank will also follow the case and set up two agricultural product warehouses in Cangqiao and other places. The methods are roughly the same. All agricultural products and agricultural tools can be used to apply for loans from the warehouse. Approximately 70% of the value of 100 yuan can be pledged, with a monthly interest rate of 9%, and a warehouse rental fee of 6%. It can be redeemed at any time, so that the farmers' economy can be used for turnover.</p>

<p>Zhu Shusheng, the newly appointed president of the Jiangsu Higher Court, recently personally set off to various places for inspection in order to understand the judicial and prison conditions in various places, so as to facilitate rectification. Some days ago, Zhu, accompanied by Yang Boken, the accounting director of the High Court, first inspected the Zhenjiang Court, then went to Changzhou, and arrived in Wuxi from Changzhou at 9 p.m. the night before. He stayed at the Railway Hotel. Xu Tigan, the president of the local branch court of this county, Qian Chengjun, the chief prosecutor, and Xing Yuantang, the prison warden, all went to the hotel to pay their respects after hearing the news. Xu and others also accompanied him to visit famous scenic spots such as Huishan, Meiyuan, and Yuantouzhu. Yesterday, he inspected the court, the newly built prison, and the detention center. After lunch, he inspected the county prison branch office and returned to Suzhou in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Disputes over the Exchange Rate of Rice and Bean Businesses</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, the rice and bean businesses in this county decided to change the 99 exchange rate to 98.4 because the price of grain was low and it was difficult to maintain expenses. This caused opposition from the grain merchants in Bengbu, who sent personnel to Wuxi to negotiate. The county chamber of commerce in this county invited grain merchants from Wuxi, Wujin, and Bengbu to discuss a solution. As a result, it was decided that when the price of yellow beans is below five yuan per stone, the 99 exchange rate will be changed to 98.6. If it rises to five yuan or more, the 99 exchange rate will be restored. All three parties agreed, and the dispute was resolved. Recently, the Bengbu Grain Industry Association, the Transportation Association, the Grain Merchants Association, etc., stated that the current price of yellow beans has risen to more than five yuan, but Wuxi has not yet restored the 99 exchange rate. Therefore, they specially requested the county chamber of commerce in that city to send a telegram to the county chamber of commerce in this county yesterday, asking it to immediately stop the 98.6 exchange rate and restore the 99 exchange rate, so as to avoid further disputes.</p>

They broke into the house and grabbed Gao, forcing him to hand over silver dollars. When this was unsuccessful, they kidnapped him. Before leaving, the bandits ordered his family to prepare 1,000 silver dollars within five days and send them to a certain place for redemption. Otherwise, they would tear up the ticket.

<p>Sanbaitang in Luxu is a vast expanse of water stretching for hundreds of miles. Yesterday, a merchant ship was sailing there when two fast boats suddenly emerged from a small port and intercepted it midway. The bandits swarmed onto the ship and robbed it at will. When the passengers tried to shout, the bandits opened fire. Fortunately, no one was injured. Before leaving, they kidnapped one of the passengers and fled with a loud shout. The patrol boat of the 7th Detachment of the Water Police stationed in Taozhuang Town received the news and immediately telegraphed the detachment headquarters for instructions. Later, it received a reply stating that the matter concerned the Jiangsu border and it was inconvenient to cross the border to pursue and suppress the bandits. Therefore, the bandits were able to escape leisurely.</p>

<p>In Zhangjiaqiao, Guojie Township, Wangdian, Jiaxing, the home of Jin Zhou, a farmer, was entered by several bandits speaking the local dialect and the dialect of traveling merchants at about 1 a.m. on the 25th. They broke in by digging a hole in the wall and held long spears and sharp knives. They shouted to forbid any noise and tied up Jin Zhou, Jin Youguan, Jin Xiaoguan, and worker Yao A'da with ropes. The bandits then broke into the inner room and searched at will. They poured kerosene on Jin Zhou and set her on fire, forcing her to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Jin Youguan's chest and face were injured by gunfire, and Jin Xiaoguan and Yao A'da's heads were injured. Jin Zhou said that there was no hidden silver in the house, so even though she was burned by the fire, she could not tell them. The bandits also searched the house, but did not find any cash. When dawn was approaching, the bandits took away clothes, soft goods, and silver dollars worth more than 300 yuan. Afterwards, a report was made to the Fifth District Office and the Fifth Public Security Bureau, who sent personnel to investigate. On the 26th, the injured people were taken to the local branch court to be examined, and a request was made to order the arrest of the stolen goods and bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Anhui Province Loan Agreement Negotiated, Draft Contract Signed <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>To Be Officially Signed in Wuhu After Provincial Government Approval</p>
<p>Totaling 1.2 Million, to Be Disbursed in Three Installments and Repaid in 20 Months</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government, due to the extraordinary severity of this year's drought and the sharp decline in tax revenue, felt that administrative expenses were difficult to manage. It therefore contacted the Central and five other banks to negotiate a loan of 1.2 million yuan to cope with the situation. The loan has been fully negotiated since Mao Longzhang, the Director of the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance, came to Shanghai to negotiate. A draft contract was signed last Saturday (the 24th), and Director Mao took it back to Anhui yesterday afternoon to report. After it is approved by the Provincial Government, it will be officially signed in Wuhu with the branches of the borrowing banks. The details of the situation learned by the New News Agency reporter are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government had previously obtained approval from the Central Government to issue 900,000 yuan of local treasury bonds for the 23rd year of the Republic. For the sake of procedural convenience, the issuance of the treasury bonds was suspended, and Director of Finance Mao Longzhang came to Shanghai to borrow 800,000 yuan from the Central and five other banks within the approved quota for treasury bonds. Together with the 400,000 yuan loan previously negotiated with the five banks to make up for the province's budget deficit, the total amount was 1.2 million yuan to be used for administrative expenses. The entire salt surplus allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the province was used as a guarantee fund. After Director Mao came to Shanghai, he repeatedly negotiated with the borrowing banks, and a full agreement was only reached last Saturday. The loan draft contract was signed.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract</p>
<p>After the loan was negotiated, Director Mao invited representatives from the borrowing banks to the Central Bank on the third floor at 3 p.m. last Saturday to make a final decision. After revising the draft contract clause by clause, the representatives of the banks signed the draft contract. The representatives who signed were Zhou Bangxin, the Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, Cheng Muhao, the Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, Zhang Peishen, the Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications, Liu Huizhi, the General Manager of the China Industrial Bank, Zou Bingwen, the Deputy Manager of the Head Office of the Shanghai Bank, and Mao Longzhang, the Director of the Anhui Department of Finance. It is also understood that the five banks mailed the draft contract to their Wuhu branches yesterday. After it is approved by the Anhui Provincial Government, it will be officially signed.</p>
<p>Five Banks Undertake the Loan</p>
<p>The banks that undertook the loan include the Central, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, and China Industrial Bank. The total amount of the loan is 1.2 million yuan. The Central Bank will undertake 600,000 yuan, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, and China Industrial Bank will undertake 600,000 yuan separately, for a total of 1.2 million yuan. The guarantee for the loan is the same as the guarantee for the Anhui Province local treasury bonds approved for issuance by the Central Government, that is, the entire salt surplus allocated by the Ministry of Finance to the province, with an annual interest rate of 9.6%, or a monthly interest rate of 8%.</p>
<p>Disbursing in Installments</p>
<p>The method of disbursing the funds is also stipulated in the contract. It will be disbursed in three installments. The first installment of 800,000 yuan will be disbursed on December 1 of this year, the second installment of 200,000 yuan will be disbursed on February 1 next year (end of the lunar year), and the third installment of 200,000 yuan will be disbursed on June 1 next year (lunar Dragon Boat Festival). It has also been decided that repayment will begin in February next year, and the full amount will be repaid in 20 months.</p>
<p>Mao Returns to Anhui</p>
<p>Mao Longzhang, the Director of the Anhui Department of Finance, has now completed his official business in Shanghai and left Shanghai for Anhui at 4 p.m. yesterday with the signed draft contract to report the progress to Liu Zhenhua, the Chairman of Anhui Province. Once it is approved by the Provincial Government, it will be officially signed with the Wuhu branches of the Central and other banks.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Finance Minister Kong Discusses Ministry of Finance's Wholesale of Cigarette Stamp Tax <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Purpose Is to Allocate Funds for Regular National Treasury Expenditures</p>
<p>Construction Bank and Other Companies Undertake the Purchase at 92% of Face Value</p>
<p>The Explanation of Mortgage Loans Is a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that in order to supplement national treasury expenditures, the Ministry of Finance recently wholesaled 30 million yuan of newly issued cigarette stamp tax tickets to the China Construction Bank and various banks in this port, to be paid in twelve installments. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter visited Kong last night and was informed of the purpose of the funds and the negotiation process. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Speaks</p>
<p>According to Kong, it has recently been rumored that the Ministry of Finance mortgaged 30 million yuan of cigarette stamp tax to the Shanghai banking community. This is indeed a fact, but it is not a "mortgage." It is that the Ministry of Finance has approved the wholesale of all 30 million yuan of newly issued cigarette stamp tax tickets to the China Construction Bank, which will then promote and undertake the purchase to its shareholder banks. The Ministry of Finance and the Construction Bank have now fully negotiated, and the Construction Bank is directly responsible to the Ministry of Finance for paying the cash.</p>
<p>Use of the Huge Sum</p>
<p>As for the Ministry of Finance, the cash will still be used to supplement regular national treasury expenditures and has no special purpose. Therefore, the wholesale of 30 million cigarette stamps is just the Ministry of Finance hoping to obtain cash for application in advance and is not in the nature of a loan. The Construction Bank itself has decided to undertake one-third of the total purchase, amounting to 10 million yuan. The remaining 20 million yuan will be allocated to the shareholder banks of the Construction Bank for undertaking the purchase. This is an internal matter of the company and is not the Ministry of Finance mortgaging loans to banks.</p>
<p>Payment at 92% of Face Value</p>
<p>Kong continued that the Ministry of Finance would allow a payment of 92% of face value for the wholesale, with 8% as the profit of the undertakers. Yesterday's report of 93% was inaccurate. It is stipulated that payment will be made in twelve installments, that is, starting next month, the silver company will be responsible for paying the Ministry of Finance each month, with a limit of one year for payment. The Ministry of Finance will then deliver 3 million yuan of cigarette stamp tax tickets to the Central Bank each month. After the Central Bank sells the tax tickets, the resulting cash will be paid to the undertakers in installments.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Two Telegrams from the All-Zhejiang Public Association to the Zhejiang Provincial Government <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Appealing for the Disaster Victims in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Re-survey the Disaster Areas, Respectfully Addressed to Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The drought disaster in Zhejiang Province this year has been extremely severe. We are currently in the rainy season, and while we urgently hope for rain, the planting of farmland is incomplete. Those that have been planted have just been transplanted, and their roots are fragile and unable to withstand the scorching sun. They have all been baked to death. According to statistics, the harvest in various counties throughout the province is only 30% to 40%. Those near the water have some harvest, but they have exhausted dozens of days and nights to pump water for irrigation, and the income is not worth the effort. They are also equally pitiful. We have heard that the Provincial Committee has investigated and reported the disaster situation and harvest quantity in various counties, such as Jiaxing County being set at 65%, Wuxing County at 50%, and Deqing County at 45%. These reports are inaccurate and inconsistent with the disaster situation in various regions. The Provincial Committee and others came to the border for investigation after the autumn harvest, and the disaster situation had already passed. Moreover, they did not conduct surveys acre by acre, but only relied on the narratives of village elders and neighborhood chiefs and made arbitrary conclusions, which are not enough to satisfy the people. This drought has lasted for more than three months, which is rare in the past century. The withered stems and leaves sway in the scorching sun, and there is no harvest, which is shocking. After successive years of famine, at a time when the countryside is collapsing, it is already difficult for middle-class farmers to survive, let alone the poor. Taxes are the sacred duty of the people, but in the midst of this disaster relief, it seems that we should be lenient so that the disaster victims can avoid being compensated. The investigation of disaster-stricken fields should be based on facts, and it is better to be lenient than harsh. It is hoped that harsh policies will be eliminated and that the benefits of tax reduction will be extended. Our Association has compassion for our hometown and cannot remain indifferent. For this reason, we urgently request that your Excellency approve the dispatch of personnel to re-survey the counties most severely affected by the disaster and grant them full exemption. Those that are slightly less severe should be reduced based on verification. All past arrears should be postponed to relieve the people's suffering and prioritize disaster relief. We respectfully bow nine times on behalf of the disaster victims. Shanghai All-Zhejiang Public Association.</p>
<p>Organize Work Relief, Respectfully Addressed to Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: This year's drought in Zhejiang has caused a disaster. The severity of the disaster and the tragedy of the situation have been reported by various counties and are already well known. There is no need to reiterate them. We have now heard that the Provincial Relief Committee has negotiated and obtained approval from your Excellency to allocate 1 million yuan in cash from the newly issued public bonds. Various charitable organizations in Shanghai, such as the Chinese Jisenghui, the China Foreign Relief Association, and the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, have also raised funds to assist in the joint implementation of winter relief. However, the disaster area is too wide, and the counties have identified nearly 3 million disaster victims who cannot survive without relief. Although the investigators have conducted house-to-house surveys and strictly eliminated some, it is still felt that the disaster is severe and the funds are insufficient to distribute. Since all are disaster victims, it is not only impossible to have one area receive relief while another is denied, but it is also unbearable. We propose to quickly convert the 6 million yuan of public bonds designated for work relief into cash and implement it simultaneously with winter relief. This will allow the strong to live by working and focus on distributing winter relief to the elderly, weak, women, and children. The number of recipients can be greatly reduced, and there will be no worry about insufficient relief funds. The future of the Zhejiang disaster is promising. Our Association appeals for the disaster victims in our hometown. For this reason, we urgently request that your Excellency quickly order the Department of Finance to raise funds to alleviate the disaster and eliminate the tragedy. We will be infinitely grateful. Shanghai All-Zhejiang Public Association.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Shanghai Money Market Extraordinarily Tight <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Call Loan Rate Rose to 28 Cents Yesterday</p>
<p>The Demand for Silver Coins in Shanghai Is Therefore Increasing Daily</p>
<p>The daily call loan rate in the Ningbo Road Money Market has soared due to the extraordinarily tight money market, and the forward discount has also increased. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Soaring</p>
<p>The call loan rate in the Ningbo Road Money Market yesterday was 28 cents for the first session at 8:30 a.m. and 28 cents for the second session at 12:30 p.m. As for the forward discount, it opened at 43 cents yesterday afternoon (that is, a discount of 43 cents per 1,000 yuan). The call loan rate is usually only five or six cents, but it has now soared from five or six cents to 15 cents, 25 cents, and reached a peak of 28 cents.</p>
<p>Various Reasons</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reporter learned from the banking and money industry that the high call loan rate is due to the increasing demand for silver dollars in the city. The reasons are that agricultural products such as cotton and miscellaneous grains are being launched on the market one after another, and businesses are importing silver into the interior to purchase them. In addition, public bonds issued by various provinces are being mortgaged for loans from Shanghai banks, and silver is also being exported, resulting in a decrease in silver reserves in the city, which has led to this phenomenon.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Japanese Military Attachés Hold Important Secret Meeting <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Suzuki and Southwestern Figures Discuss Sino-Japanese Cooperation</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Sell Well in Guangdong and Guangxi, Anti-Japanese Atmosphere Disappears</p>
<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports that Japan's long-standing designs on South China are evidenced by the so-called "Across the Strait Conference" held in Taiwan and the purchase of military equipment by the Japanese on behalf of the Southwestern military and the employment of more than ten Japanese military officers in Guangxi, which stirred up student unrest. Its emphasis on South China is evident. Recently, Lieutenant General Suzuki, after inspecting Guangdong and Guangxi, convened resident army military attachés from various places in South and North China in Shanghai on the 17th and 18th of this month and held an important secret meeting at the Donghe Foreign Firm on Peng Road, Hongkou. The attendees included military attachés Hanatani from Jinan, Chichi from Guangzhou, Wataru from Hankou, Takahashi from Nanjing, Shibayama from Beiping, Izomoto from Shanghai, Chief of Staff Sakai of the Tianjin Garrison, and Colonel Otori, the head of the special service agency in the puppet state. First, they listened to reports from military attachés from various places, discussed and agreed on a unified attitude towards China in the future. Lieutenant General Suzuki reported on the inspection of Guangdong and Guangxi. The meeting was extremely confidential. It is said that the Japanese military's policy toward China has always been consistent. Lieutenant General Suzuki went to Guangdong and Guangxi for inspection on the 30th of last month and returned to Shanghai on the 16th of this month after half a month. According to his remarks, after arriving in Guangdong, he met with Hu Hanmin and Chen Jitang and exchanged frank opinions on the China issue. He then went to Guangxi to meet with Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi. Summarizing the talks of Hu, Chen, Li, and Bai, he learned that the southwestern figures all held the same view, that is, to establish peace in East Asia based on the Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asian ideal, China must cooperate with Japan. He also said that the previous anti-Japanese slogans in the Southwest were due to the circumstances at the time and were not their original intention. There is now no anti-Japanese sentiment in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Japanese goods are selling well. They (referring to Hu, Chen, Li, and Bai) are convinced that Sino-Japanese friendship must start with economic cooperation. Therefore, I am convinced that Japan should pay full attention to this point in order to gradually promote the reality of friendly relations between China and Japan in the economic field and to consolidate the foundation of lasting peace in the Orient. After the meeting adjourned, the military attachés are now leaving Shanghai one after another. It is also heard that a certain military attaché has been appointed to return to Tokyo yesterday to report to the military. As for the content of the meeting, due to its confidential nature, the details are unknown. However, it is rumored that the result of the meeting suggested to the Japanese military that the situation in East China, South China, and North China is different, and the corresponding policies should therefore be different.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Public Security Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Shanghai Municipal Council Urge Private Postal Services to Cease Operations <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Petition to the Capital Fails, Ready to Close Down</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Unemployed Employees Should Be Provided for</p>
<p>A report from the Huadong News Agency states that in order to unify the postal system, the Ministry of Transportation has specially ordered the Directorate General of Posts to strictly order domestic private postal services to cease operations, and has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to all provincial, municipal, military, and police authorities to assist the post office in suppressing them, ensuring that they all close down within a set period. This matter has been reported in the newspapers repeatedly. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency continued to investigate the situation at the private postal services and recorded the following details:</p>
<p>Petition to the Capital Ultimately Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency inquired at the Quansheng Private Postal Service in Shanghai and learned that since the Ministry of Transportation ordered all private postal services nationwide to close down within this year, industry colleagues from private postal services across the country, fearing that their livelihoods would be cut off and their future would be difficult to sustain, have successively dispatched representatives to the capital to petition the central government. Recently, Shanghai dispatched Hua Yunjin and Yin Yuantong, together with Ningbo representatives Wang Wenjiang and Wu Yunyu, Suzhou representative Ren Shiting, Shaoxing representative Wang Tongren, and others, from Shanghai to Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, and other agencies. However, the Ministry of Transportation's determination to suppress private postal services was resolute and could not be reversed, so they ultimately did not receive the authorities' permission. The representatives returned due to the lack of results.</p>
<p>Preparing to Close Down Due to the Situation</p>
<p>Currently, November is almost over, and the deadline is approaching in an instant. There is only one month left until the end of the year. Industry colleagues in inland areas such as Hankou, Hangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Jinan, Xuzhou, Ningbo, Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, Wenzhou, and Zhenjiang have already been urged by the local police bureau, at the request of the local post office, to close down by the end of the year. Private postal services in these areas have no room for maneuver, so they are all preparing to close down.</p>
<p>Four Bureaus Urge Closure Earnestly</p>
<p>There are a total of 54 private postal services in Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, as well as the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the request of the Postal Administration and following the instructions of the Executive Yuan, dispatched detectives and staff yesterday morning to earnestly urge them to close down one by one within their respective jurisdictions. Now, due to the situation, the industry is preparing to close down by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Aftermath Problems Particularly Difficult</p>
<p>However, the aftermath problem after the closure of the private postal services is particularly difficult. Private postal services were founded in the early Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty and have a history of hundreds of years. They have been painstakingly managed and have worked hard to gain the trust of the people. No fewer than 100,000 people depend on this for a living. Therefore, there have been no surpluses in the past century of efforts to develop credit. Now that it has been decided to close down by the end of the year, 100,000 employees of private postal services nationwide will be completely unemployed, resulting in labor-management dismissal problems. The capital side has no surplus funds to provide severance pay, and the labor side will find it difficult to maintain their future livelihoods, so it is considered very serious.</p>
<p>Private Postal Service Guild Hall Held Another Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the national private postal service industry held an emergency representative meeting again at the Private Postal Service Guild Hall on Lixian'gua Street, starting from 4:00 PM and ending at 6:00 PM. More than 30 representatives, including Hua Yunjin, Yin Yuantong, Wang Tongwen, Ren Shiting, and Wu Yunyu, attended the meeting. Representatives were immediately elected to draft a memorial and decided to submit petitions to the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Directorate General of Posts, and other related agencies this Wednesday or Thursday to explain the difficult situation. It is also understood that the representatives plan to go to Beijing in batches before the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, first individually requesting each member of the Central Committee, and then gathering again on December 10 to petition the meeting.</p>
<p>Appropriate Jobs for Unemployed Employees</p>
<p>At present, although the government also recognizes that private postal services are disseminators of culture in China, the postal service is a state-run business in all countries around the world. The prevalence of private postal services fundamentally conflicts with the postal service, so it has no choice but to suppress them painfully. The aftermath of the livelihoods of unemployed employees is indeed a major problem. According to a semi-official source familiar with this industry, the government has made the utmost determination to urge private postal services to cease operations, but is hesitant about appropriate jobs for unemployed employees. In fact, the most appropriate placement method would be to send this large number of employees to border areas where post offices are scarce to establish post offices, because there are many hardworking and diligent people in the private postal service industry, and they also have a rough understanding of writing. If they can discuss this with each other, it will be beneficial to all aspects of China's cultural and transportation construction, and the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people can also be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e117">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Inspects Haiheng Vessel Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Shipowner Decides to Use Chinese Nationals</p>
<p>Absolutely Will Not Yield to Hong Kong</p>
<p>After the second new vessel, Haiheng, of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai, it entered the No. 3 New Dock of the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant of the Naval Department in Gaochangmiao. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Zhao Yuntai, section chief of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Marine Department, and engineers from the Shanghai representative office of the British shipyard that built the vessel went to Gaochangmiao to inspect the machinery. After the inspection is completed, the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant will paint it. The company plans to take over on the 29th. However, regarding the issue of the shipmaster, the Hong Kong Marine Department insists that Chinese must take an exam, otherwise even the first mate must be filled by foreign personnel before a passenger license can be issued. The company believes that the Hong Kong government is discriminating against China. If it yields again, it will not only affect China's sovereignty and status, but will also make it impossible for China to regain its navigation rights. Therefore, it has decided to sacrifice Hong Kong passengers and use Chinese nationals as captains, refusing to take the exam.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Authorities Insist on Preconceived Ideas</p>
<p>Zhou Houkun, deputy director of the Marine Department, was specially sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Marine Department for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's application for a Hong Kong passenger license for the Sihai vessel. Because the shipmaster of the Haiyuan vessel is a foreign national, there is no problem and it has already been issued. For other vessels, the Hong Kong authorities still insist on preconceived ideas. If the shipmaster is a foreigner, it can be issued, but if a Chinese is used, it is difficult to agree, and at least an examination must be added. Director Zhou repeatedly argued that the Chinese shipmaster already has a certificate issued by the Chinese government, and the Hong Kong government should not add an exam. Mr. Zhou has now returned to Shanghai on the McKinley President vessel of the Dollar Steamship Lines, saying that the Hong Kong government requires that the shipmaster, first mate, and chief engineer of the new vessel must all be foreigners before it can be granted, otherwise it will absolutely not sympathize.</p>
<p>Company Decides to Use Chinese Nationals</p>
<p>The shipmaster, first, second, and third mates of the Haiheng are all Chinese nationals. This was approved by the board of directors as early as last Thursday (as reported in this newspaper). Now, according to Director Zhou's return from Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government's position was discussed again at the board of directors. It was unanimously agreed that this matter concerns the status of the country, and the Hong Kong government is too embarrassing to China. Moreover, the shipmaster of the vessel has been appointed Ma Jiajun, and no changes will be made under any circumstances. It was decided to use Chinese nationals to drive the vessel. The chief shipmaster and the director of the Marine Department also expressed their sympathy. Therefore, the board of directors resolved that all crew members of the Haiheng vessel should be Chinese nationals and ordered them to prepare to take up their posts on the vessel immediately.</p>
<p>Willing to Sacrifice Hong Kong Route</p>
<p>However, using Chinese shipmasters, at most, will not issue passenger licenses for Hong Kong. After discussion, the company believes that the purpose of the new ocean-going vessel is specifically for Swatow and Guangdong, and it is not specifically prepared for Hong Kong passenger seats. Therefore, it is willing to sacrifice Hong Kong passengers and absolutely cannot yield to the Hong Kong authorities' demands and degrade the country's status. After this matter was announced, China's navigation industry and shipmasters expressed their admiration for the company's unyielding spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Rumors of Private Takeover of the Ping-Shen Through Train <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Neither Signed a Contract nor Registered</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Merchants Unwilling to Continue After Trial Period Expires</p>
<p>Japanese Side Indicates That the Two Governments Are Determined to Maintain It</p>
<p>The Ping-Shen through train, organized by the Oriental Travel Agency, has been in operation for nearly five months. It was once rumored that the agency would be reorganized, but then the news subsided. The agency was originally jointly established by the China Travel Service and the Japan Tourist Bureau, but recently both parties have expressed their unwillingness to continue operating it. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency specially visited the responsible personnel of both parties to inquire about the truth. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Chen Xiangtao's Remarks According to Chen Xiangtao, president of the China Travel Service, the organization of the Oriental Travel Agency stipulates that it must be registered with the Chinese government. Neither the China Travel Service nor the Tourist Bureau has formally signed any contract, so it has not been registered. Initially, Mr. Hirayama, the Japanese representative, drafted a contract and sent it to our representative, Zhang Shuiqi, who forwarded it to Shanghai. I instructed him to make some revisions to its contents. Then Mr. Hirayama said that it was not necessary to sign a contract for the time being. The Tourist Bureau plans to get rid of its responsibility after the trial operation period expires. Representative Zhang also stated that the China Travel Service has the same intention. This intention was originally proposed by the Japanese side. Since its establishment, the Oriental Travel Agency has handled everything on its own, and the China Travel Service has never intervened. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to bear the name in vain. Moreover, the China Travel Service's acceptance of the railway's entrustment is "a trial operation for six months." Therefore, the company replied to the Ministry of Railways' letter No. 2369 on June 13, which is the same opinion as the board of directors' resolution (the letter has been published). Now that the Japanese International Tourist Bureau is unwilling to continue, the company is also very willing to end it as scheduled on December 31 according to the previous board of directors' resolution. Moreover, Mr. Hirayama and Zhang Shuiqi, the persons in charge of the Oriental Travel Agency, both intend to take over in their private capacities, which the company is even more happy to see. If the Ministry of Railways still needs to continue, it will depend on the decision of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Tourist Bureau's Statement According to Fujisue Kenzo, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Japan International Tourist Bureau, he is not clear about the truth of the news that the bureau plans to withdraw from the Oriental Travel Agency. The truth in Shanghai has not been clarified. This matter is organized by the Tokyo headquarters, and there has been no indication to the Shanghai branch.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Japanese Authorities Yesterday morning, the reporter went to the Shanghai office of the Japanese Railway Ministry to inquire. Okutani Saburo, the official in charge, came out to meet. According to him, the Tourist Bureau has not made any requests to the government regarding this matter, and the officialdom has not received any formal news. He believes that this news is probably a rumor. Even if the Tourist Bureau and the China Travel Service are unwilling to continue operating it, the Chinese and Japanese governments will definitely use the power of the government to dispel this intention and continue to operate it. Furthermore, even if the Oriental Travel Agency is not continued, it is not impossible to establish another agency.</p>

<p>Japan's expulsion of overseas Chinese continues unabated. In the past two months, sixteen batches of our overseas Chinese have been expelled back to China. More than 20 homeless refugees are stranded in Shanghai, and the authorities have not yet taken proper measures, causing the livelihoods of overseas Chinese to be particularly alarming. The seventeenth batch of expelled overseas Chinese, including Xu Zhisong, Yu Xiangyan, Xu Jingfei, Xu Zhilian, and Ye Xunsen, arrived in Shanghai on the Asama Maru yesterday afternoon and are staying at the Laogongxin Inn. The situation is extremely embarrassing. It is said that a large number of overseas Chinese will be expelled to Shanghai in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Guild Hall has recently spared no effort in rectifying guild affairs, correcting malpractices in the industry, and seeking the welfare of the industry. Three major guidelines for rectifying industry regulations were previously agreed upon and have been signed and followed by relevant industry colleagues, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the fifth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the guild hall was held. Twelve members, including Luo Qinghua, Xi Gongshi, Suo Zuosun, Cheng Weisheng, Shen Qinzhai, Wu Xingcha, Luo Liqin, Xu Limin, Lou Fengshao, Lu Zhengbing, Tu Zhongying, and Shen Jien, attended the meeting. Luo Qinghua chaired the meeting, and after performing the ceremony, the chairman reported on the reply telegram from Chairman Jiang and began to discuss (1) the case of earnestly rectifying industry regulations, which was resolved as follows: (A) The three major guidelines previously agreed upon will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for record (B) Industry colleagues who delay in implementing the aforementioned guidelines should first be corrected by sending letters (C) Regarding the old Jiuhuo between various factories and shops, the sentiment of the host and guest between industry colleagues should be restored. After being notified in a consolidated case, letters will now be sent to all factories and shops under this guild hall to follow them together, and the Electrical Machinery Guild Hall will also be requested to forward them to its members for reference (2) The Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry plans to formulate an outline for the identification of domestic silk and satin and solicit opinions, which was resolved as follows: a letter will be sent to state opinions (3) The case of organizing a national silk exhibition, which was resolved as follows: Wang Yansong, Luo Qinghua, Wu Zhihao, Lu Zhengbing, Shen Qinzhai, Wu Xingcha, Lou Fengshao, Tu Zhongying, Luo Kunxiang, and others were appointed as preparation committee members, and a reply letter was sent to Mr. Shen Tianxin of the Hu She to jointly prepare. After resolving the important cases, the meeting adjourned. After the meeting, the chairman of the guild hall said that this guild hall is composed of silk and satin factories and shops from Hangzhou, Huzhou, Suzhou, Sheng, Lu, and Yu, and silk and satin bureaus in Shanghai, with a wide range. Rectification is not easy, but if they are allowed to fight each other, they will all perish. How can this be the blessing of the national economy and the people's livelihood? Therefore, this guild hall will not avoid difficulties and will earnestly rectify. The three major guidelines previously agreed upon have been unanimously signed by the retail industry, which shows that industry colleagues have a deep understanding. This guild hall is now submitting the aforementioned guidelines to the competent authorities for record in accordance with industry regulations, hoping that industry colleagues can abide by them consistently. If there are still those who comply in appearance but disobey in reality, regardless of whether they are members or non-members, they will be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for punishment in accordance with Article 26 of the industry regulations. There will be no favoritism. The day before yesterday, 38 industry colleagues jointly sent a letter to me, pointing out that a certain silk and satin bureau did not comply with the guidelines. This guild hall immediately sent a letter to correct it. The silk and satin bureau has accepted the advice, and others who have not complied have also been corrected by sending letters. In summary, this guild hall has an unshirkable duty to revive national silk, but it is hoped that all industry colleagues will work together. If there are opinions to be stated, you can feel free to do so and do not need to issue anonymous letters. As for organizing a national silk exhibition, the purpose is to promote the advantages of national silk and enable all sectors to have a correct understanding of it. In the future, we will also need the help of the press.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, a dispatch from the capital states that the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Transportation has been scheduled to move from Shanghai to Beijing before December 15. According to the reporter's inquiry with the bureau, Zhu Menghou, director of the General Affairs Department, said that the bureau has not yet received an order from the ministry regarding the deadline for the move to Beijing. According to information obtained by the bureau, the earliest time to move to Beijing for office work will be New Year's Day next year, because the new building of the Nanjing General Bureau has not yet been fully completed, and the children of the employees of the Shanghai Post Office are studying in schools in Shanghai, so they must wait until the end of their academic semester before they can go to Beijing with their parents. As for private postal services, the Ministry of Transportation has ordered them to stop operating by the end of this year, and the deadline will not be extended.</p>

<p>Ningbo Gang Overwhelmed</p>
<p>Criminal Lawsuit Filed with the Court</p>
<p>Requesting Assistance from Fellow Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Association Sends Letter to Water Patrol Team to Stop</p>
<p>From Floating Buoy No. 17 to Floating Buoy No. 30 in Yangshupu, Shanghai, the mooring and unmooring of all vessels of various shipping companies berthing or departing at that location has been contracted by a Ningbo man named Chen Shenbao since 1926. The shipping companies subsidize Chen Shenbao's labor costs of five or six yuan each month. The total monthly income is also around one hundred yuan. Therefore, Chen has been running this business for nine years, working hard and saving carefully, and now he is well-off. However, Chen Shenbao's experience is well known to his colleagues at the pier, who are very envious. There is no shortage of those who want</p>
<p>to replace him. Unexpectedly, the other day, Shen Youcai, a local who is engaged in loading and unloading work at the pier, gathered more than 30 accomplices and, in three rowing boats, propped up to Chen's work place in Yangshupu, driving away Chen and Chen's assistants, and replacing them in the mooring and unmooring work for various shipping vessels from Floating Buoy No. 17 to Floating Buoy No. 30. At that time, Chen refused to accept it and also led his assistants</p>
<p>to fight back, but eventually retreated due to being overwhelmed. However, he could not bear to give up the business rights that had been in place for many years. Therefore, in addition to entrusting lawyer Liu Shiqi to file a criminal lawsuit with the local court, he went to the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai on Tibet Road the day before yesterday evening to request assistance. Based on the above-mentioned facts, the association specially sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Water Patrol Team yesterday morning,</p>
<p>requesting strict prohibition. The original letter is recorded below. Dear Sirs, According to a letter from our fellow villager Chen Shenbao (omitted), he requests that we provide assistance, etc. It has been reported to the association that Shen Youcai and others have forcibly seized the business, which is illegal. Before the matter is resolved by the court, we request that Your Captain strictly prohibit it and issue a notice to avoid disputes. We hereby send this letter to you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it accordingly. This letter is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Water Patrol Team.</p>

<p>The weather in Shanghai has been very warm in recent days, with the temperature rising to around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Yesterday morning, it suddenly rained continuously, and there was no sunlight all day. By around 6:00 PM in the evening, heavy fog was spreading. When the reporter went to Zhabei, the lighthouses of the Yong'an, Sincere, and New World companies on the Xinza Road Bridge all looked dim. Although the heavy fog seemed to dissipate slightly after dark, there was still a drizzling rain. According to general expectations, a strong northwesterly wind will blow within days, otherwise it will be difficult to hope for sunny weather.</p>

<p>Dr. Eddie of the United States is a world-renowned speaker. This is his ninth visit to China. His speeches in various provinces have been warmly welcomed. Last night at 7:00 PM, the Shanghai YMCA specially held a welcome reception for Dr. Eddie in the West Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA. More than 200 guests attended. At the reception, Dr. Cao Yunxiang, chairman of the association, first gave a welcome speech, and Mr. Lu Ganchen, the general secretary of the association, gave an introduction. Then Dr. Eddie gave a speech on "China and the Crisis of the World." There were also musical performances and singing on the spot to add to the excitement. Dr. Eddie's speech briefly stated that he had recently traveled around the world and saw that all countries were hiding crises. This crisis has recently affected China. However, China has a very ancient culture and many farmers. Now it only needs a strong leader to save China. In the past, Poland and Denmark had lost their lands, but later they became strong by revitalizing education and purifying officialdom. There are too many illiterate people in China, and officials are often corrupt. Moreover, Sichuan has collected taxes for decades to come, and there are opium and heroin in North China that poison the people. Ladies and gentlemen, if you cut open my heart and look, there are two words "China" in my heart. I love China. I hope that the Chinese nation will be revived. I must hope that everyone will remove their "selfish" hearts, let the poor have food to eat, and no longer oppress the majority of the poor.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Robbery at Yucheng Silver Company on Henan Road <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Company Employees First Bound Up</p>
<p>Eight Thousand Four Hundred Yuan Stolen</p>
<p>As winter approaches and the weather turns colder, a class of petty thieves, mostly driven by hunger and cold, resort to desperate measures. As a result, robbery cases have been occurring frequently for the past month, reaching alarming numbers. However, a careful examination of these individuals' actions suggests they are premeditated and deeply familiar with the inner workings. Otherwise, they could never be so agile. Since the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank was robbed of over four thousand yuan the day before yesterday, all parties are in pursuit. Unexpectedly, the Yucheng Silver Company on Henan Road was reported to have been robbed yesterday morning. It is learned that the company is located at No. 111, 2nd Floor, Jinxing Building, No. 505 Henan Road, Public Concession. The manager is Xie Xuchu from Shaoxing. Yesterday morning, around 9:00 AM, the company sent employees to withdraw over eight thousand yuan in bank notes from the China Industrial Bank. They immediately locked it in the safe. Before the key was even fully turned, three robbers, each wearing a long robe and brandishing a pistol from their sleeves, broke into the company's office. They threatened the staff to remain silent, then proceeded to bind all those in the office and confine them to a single room, guarded by one of the robbers. They then interrogated who was in charge of accounting and demanded the safe keys, making off with all eight thousand four hundred and eighty-odd yuan in bank notes that had just been stored. The robbers then hastily fled downstairs. By the time the staff managed to break free of their bonds and chase them downstairs, the robbers had long disappeared without a trace. They immediately reported the incident to Manager Xie Xuchu, who in turn reported it to the police station, requesting an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and inquire about the appearance and features of the robbers to aid in the pursuit. However, it is noteworthy that the robbers were well-informed, agile in their methods, and always successful, especially focusing on financial institutions, which is worthy of further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Forgery of School Certificate Case Appealed and Returned for Retrial <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhen, from Baoshan, studied at the private Qunzhi University on Caobadu Roberts Road. The school closed down in 1930. Zhang Zhen then forged a graduation certificate from the school to defraud others and petitioned the Ministry of Judicial Administration for qualification, obtaining a lawyer's certificate. The Ministry of Judicial Administration detected suspicious circumstances and transferred the case to the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate for investigation. A newly carved wooden seal of "(Shanghai Private Qunzhi University) (Fengtian Fengcheng Yucai) (Fujian Pucheng Puguan) Two Middle Schools" and private seals of Zhang Xiangwen and others, totaling fifteen, were found at Zhang's residence, along with blank graduation certificates, etc. Zhang Zhen was immediately detained, interrogated, and prosecuted in the criminal court. Zhang Zhen was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and a fine of four hundred yuan for forging seals. Zhang Zhen refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the original court. As a result, the appeal was rejected. Zhang then appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, and the High Court issued a verdict: (Main text) The original judgment is revoked, and the case is returned to the Shanghai Local Court for a new trial. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Guan Liting specially opened the Tenth Court for the trial. Zhang Zhen hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to appear in court to defend him. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the detained Zhang Zhen to be brought to the stand. Zhang stated that he was 24 years old, from Baoshan, residing at No. 9, Zhonghua Road, Ximen. He enrolled in Qunzhi University in the spring of 1927 and graduated in the summer of 1930, with over three hundred classmates. All the graduation certificates were entrusted to the defendant by Principal Luo Jie, who collected a handling fee of five yuan per certificate, totaling about thirty certificates, or over one hundred yuan. After obtaining the confession, the judge ordered him to be remanded in custody and to await a continued hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Shooting Incident in a Brothel <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xin Sentenced to Three Months Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Xin, an employee of the Yifeng Sugar and Porcelain Factory, previously drank excessively at the Huanqiu Hong brothel. Later, he went to Lu Aiying, a prostitute at the Lihua brothel in Fuxiang Lane, Guangxi Road, and somehow took out his self-defense pistol and fired a shot, hitting Zhang Sujuan, a prostitute in the same courtyard, in the right leg. Chen was arrested by the police and prosecuted in the First Special Court under Article 282 of the Criminal Law. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the chief criminal judge of the First Special Court, continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that the injury to the victim, Zhang Sujuan, has been diagnosed by a doctor. The bullet hit the bone under the left leg, which is now fixed with a plaster cast and will take about four weeks to heal and should not result in a permanent disability. When questioned, Chen Xin confessed that it was indeed due to excessive drinking. The court informed him that Zhang Sujuan's mother had filed a civil suit, demanding compensation of six thousand yuan. What is your intention? He replied that he was unable to pay this amount. The court then ordered the commencement of arguments. After the police lawyer, Wang, made his argument, Chen's lawyer, Fan Gang, rose to respond, stating briefly that the charge of attempted murder brought by the police could not be sustained. At the time, the defendant was indeed confused by alcohol and his mind was unclear, and there was no intention to kill. However, negligence cannot be avoided. The defendant's family relies entirely on him for a living. The court should grant leniency and impose a particularly light sentence. Judge Qian then announced the verdict in court, sentencing Chen Xin to three months of imprisonment for using a method sufficient to cause death and injuring a person. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be offset at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. One pistol and five bullets were confiscated. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the civil court of this court for trial.</p>

<p>Date: 4:00 PM on the 29th</p>
<p>Location: 9th Floor, YMCA, Baxianqiao</p>
<p>German Modern Art Products were exhibited at the German School in this city two years ago. At that time, due to the limited space and small scale, its excellent results have been deeply imprinted in the minds of Shanghai residents. Now, it is learned that there will be a large-scale exhibition again. The location has been selected on the 9th floor of the YMCA in Baxianqiao, Route Min Teh Ni Ying, French Concession, this city. It is scheduled to open at 4:00 PM on the 29th of this month, that is, this Thursday. The exhibition will be held there from 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day until the 5th of next month. The exhibits include a large number of oil paintings, watercolor paintings, copperplate paintings, pastel paintings, and woodcut art. Most of them are carefully crafted works by emerging German artists, depicting German city and rural landscapes. The prices are very low, ranging from two yuan to one hundred and twenty-five yuan, and most of the works are below twenty-five yuan, making them most suitable as Christmas gifts. The persons in charge are Mrs. Klippai, wife of the German Consul General in Shanghai, Mrs. Wang Rutang, wife of the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Lawrence, wife of the manager of the German firm Lihe Foreign Firm, and Ms. Huang, chairman of the Shanghai YWCA. It is heard that the admission ticket for this exhibition costs only five dimes, and all the proceeds from the ticket sales will be transferred to the Pudong Civilian Model Village to be used as a charitable act. Through this exhibition, the cultural relationship between China and Germany will be deepened.</p>

<p>The Rebuilding Cao E Filial Daughter Temple Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Shanghai Association of Fellow Townsmen from the Seven Counties of Shaoxing. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Xu Qianlin, Wang Yansong (representative of Tian Xiangru), Pei Yunqing, Zhang Deyi, Zhu Xinpei, Lu Zhinan, Ren Fengkui, Chen Yangqing, Zhang Congpei, and others attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on the total budget for construction materials, which requires 100,000 yuan. The rear hall has already been completed, costing over 27,000 yuan in labor and materials. The donations collected by various money shops and banks totaled over 18,000 yuan as of today. The main hall has already started construction. The principle of the project is to be solid and durable, not pursuing aesthetics. Next, it was resolved that all previous payments were temporarily advanced by Ren Fengkui. As the end of the year approaches, payments for various construction materials must be met and reimbursed, which is a significant shortfall. Each committee member should do their best to raise funds. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the committee, and Pei Yunqing, the economic committee member, were publicly elected to be responsible for stamping the donation checks for action by the various villages to show seriousness. A request will also be submitted to the Shaoxing County Government to approve the construction of a dry sluice gate and issue a notice prohibiting the accumulation of dirty debris in the temple to enhance its appearance.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Federation of Charitable Organizations is running a temporary winter shelter, scheduled to open on December 1st. Yesterday, it specially submitted a request to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau for funding for relief and sent separate letters to major philanthropists soliciting donations for assistance to maintain operations. The document submitted to the Municipal Government stated: "Regarding the matter of requesting funds, we received an official letter from the Social Affairs Bureau stating that the Municipal Winter Civilian Shelters have been organized by your association in the past, with remarkable results, benefiting the poor significantly. The severe drought in various provinces this year has led to rural bankruptcy, and the lack of competitiveness in industry and commerce has resulted in a large number of unemployed people, increasing poverty, making it even more necessary to follow the previous cases. Now that winter is approaching, we are hereby requested to review the previous cases, start preparing early, and report the preparation situation. This is our hope.' A proposal was convened on the 14th of this month by various charitable organizations, stating that after the drought this year, all industries have been devastated, and there are more poor people. The winter shelter should be organized early to provide relief. Our association will actively prepare for it, and it has been decided to start accepting people on December 1st. The Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station will be borrowed as the first shelter, and the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road will be the second shelter. After the two shelters are full, we will look for houses to expand. As for the expenses for accommodation, more than 10,000 yuan was raised by various charitable organizations during the meeting on the 14th of this month. It is estimated that the number of people accommodated this year will be even more than in previous years, resulting in a significant shortfall. At a time when the market is declining, fundraising is particularly difficult. In previous years, we received assistance from Junfu, and even more is needed this year. We sincerely request that you review the case and allocate additional funds, while our association will find ways to solicit donations to meet the needs. We are extremely grateful.' (The Social Affairs Bureau document is omitted.) Separate letters were sent to the Relief Committee, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Huashang Electric Company, Inland Tap Water Company, Flour Exchange, Merchant Shipping Association, Chinese Red Cross Society, Yan Weilian, Pang Yitai, and other philanthropists, stating: 'We are writing to inform you that our association establishes winter shelters every year to accommodate the poor. After the drought this year, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and all industries have been devastated, with more poor people. We plan to start early and have decided to start accommodating people on December 1st. The Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station will be borrowed as the first shelter, and the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road will be the second shelter. After the two shelters are full, we will look for houses to expand. However, the shelters have no dedicated funds and rely entirely on donations. We are grateful for the donations and assistance from your association over the years, which have benefited the poor. Even more is needed this year. We sincerely request that you generously donate to maintain operations. If you generously provide benevolent aid, we will be deeply grateful.'"</p>

<h3 id="e135">Various Groups in Fuyang County Send Telegram to Shanghai Requesting Disaster Relief Due to Severe Drought <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>160,000 Disaster Victims Wandering the Roads</p>
<p>Hoping for Generous Relief Funds to Alleviate Suffering</p>
<p>Various groups such as the Fuyang County Party Department and the County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to various charitable organizations in this city yesterday requesting disaster relief due to the severe disaster situation in the county. The original telegram stated: 'Respected recipients, Our Fuyang is located in the lower reaches of the Qiantang River. The areas along the river are all low-lying, while the surrounding villages are high-lying. Three days of rain will cause floods, turning the area into a swamp. Ten days of sunshine will cause rivers to dry up and fields to crack. Years of rice moth disasters and floods have followed one after another, like a sick man who has suffered from a long-term illness, whose vital energy and essence have been exhausted and who is confined to bed. But if the sick body has a chance to rest, then our people may have a chance to recover. Why is the heaven so unkind, sending down another terrible disaster? Since summer, it has been sunny and without rain, and the long drought has become a disaster. The rice seedlings have all withered. Early crops such as corn have had reduced harvests due to the lack of water. Autumn crops such as buckwheat have also withered one after another due to the early frost. In total, there are as many as 160,000 disaster victims in Fuyang. The cries of geese are everywhere, and refugees wander the roads. Prosperous families have become poor people, and the extremely poor have become starving people. They dig grass roots to fill their stomachs and peel tree bark to satisfy their hunger. In the blink of an eye, the weather will be cold and freezing, and the hungry people will have no clothes and no food. The tragic scene is unbearable to imagine. This is truly a great catastrophe in history and a great disaster in a century. Our association and others serve our hometown, with a strong sense of responsibility. Witnessing the tragic scene, it is difficult to sit idly by. In addition to exhausting our meager efforts to appeal to the local authorities in various counties for relief, we have always admired your association's concern for the suffering and your compassion for others. Relief does not distinguish between regions, and donations are made without regard to east or west. We dare to imitate the weeping of the prison gatekeeper to replace the call of Jiang Bo. We humbly hope that you will have compassion for the disaster victims, jointly seek rescue, and generously grant relief funds to alleviate their suffering. Either remit the funds to our association for distribution or send personnel to the disaster area for distribution. In any case, a steady stream of thousands of gold and ten thousand mirrors will arrive, and the survivors after the catastrophe will forever be grateful for the boundless merit. Urgent words, mixed with tears, kind clouds are in the hall, endlessly reluctant. Fuyang County Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Zhejiang Province, County Farmers Association Relief Association, Women's Association, Committee for the Management of County Public Funds and Properties, County Chamber of Commerce, Stevedores' Union, etc., kowtow together.'"</p>
<h3 id="e136">Pudong Public Security Bureau Rectifies Traffic at Dongchang Wharf <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Specifies Eleven Measures</p>
<p>Since the opening of the city ferry, the number of rickshaws at Dongchang Road Wharf in Pudong has increased significantly. Conflicts often arise due to soliciting business or arguing about fares. Zhang, the Director of the Pudong Public Security Bureau, gathered opinions from all parties to address this traffic issue and formulated eleven compromise measures, which were announced to passengers and rickshaw pullers for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) There are 41 fixed rickshaws at Dongchang Road Wharf every day. The west end of the parking area is designated as the starting point. Latecomers or non-fixed rickshaws should line up neatly in order from east to west according to the prescribed sequence (one row if there are few cars, two rows if there are many cars). Rickshaw pullers are not allowed to leave their cars to solicit business at the wharf. (2) After fixed or non-fixed rickshaws transport passengers to the wharf, they must turn left and exit through the back door of Huatong Warehouse. They must not linger or solicit business directly, obstructing order and traffic. (3) Among the 41 fixed rickshaw pullers, one person should be drawn in rotation every day to be on duty (the rotation list will be determined separately) to maintain order in the wharf parking area. (4) The on-duty rickshaw puller's service hours are from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. (5) The on-duty rickshaw puller's meal expenses are borne by the non-on-duty fixed rickshaw pullers. Each person will pay a certain amount of copper coins to the on-duty rickshaw puller as meal expenses. (6) The on-duty rickshaw puller must wear a numbered uniform (style to be determined separately) during service hours for identification. (7) Starting from Dongchang Road Wharf, the minimum rickshaw fare is 15 copper coins. A full-day fare is $1.50, including meal expenses. Passengers can choose to tip for meal expenses. Thirteen hours is considered one day. The zero-hire fares to various places in Pudong are detailed in a separate table. A surcharge of 30 cents will be added for waiting over one hour, and so on. For those waiting for a long time, the fare can also be negotiated to some extent, but it should not exceed the all-inclusive price. (8) For pilgrims from Dongchang Road Wharf to Qinci Yangdian Temple, the round-trip fare is 60 cents. The round-trip fare to Qijia Temple is 80 cents. Even if the waiting time is longer, it must not be calculated according to the example of Article 7. (9) If passengers and rickshaw pullers know each other or have a special relationship and do not follow these measures, both parties are free to ride or pull.

<h3 id="e139">Kidnapping Case Cracked in Zhenru <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Three Kidnappers Captured on the Spot</p>
<p>Two Hostages Rescued in Suzhou</p>
<p>To Be Sent to Suzhou for Trial Within Days</p>
<p>Zhou Weilie, the director of the Second District of the Jiangsu River Police, has been planning the defense since his transfer, which is quite comprehensive. Unexpectedly, last month, Zhu Shouchun, the son of Jin Qiangui from Zhu Mazhuang, Hushu Pass, and Ni Mu, Bao and his son Yuan Yuan, grandson Xiao Laohu, etc. from Lushangwei Village in Wuxian County were kidnapped and ransomed successively. Afterwards, the district director immediately ordered the team to search and investigate in all directions. As a result, the case was solved in Zhenru the day before yesterday, and three kidnappers, Wang Ziqing, Guo Kuangsheng, and Liu Ziming, were captured on the spot, and two hostages were rescued. Two pistols were seized. The reporter of Huadong News Agency made a special investigation and recorded the following:</p>
<p>The Whole Family Was Kidnapped. On the evening of October 1st, at about 9:00 PM, more than ten robbers suddenly came to the home of Ni Mubao in Lushangwei Village, Wuxian County. They pried into the house from the roof of the wing room, then opened the gate and searched and robbed at will for about an hour. Before leaving, they kidnapped Ni Mubao and his son Yuan Yuan. On the night of October 3rd, several thieves came again and kidnapped his grandson Xiao Laohu for ransom. One of the kidnaped Ni Mubao has been rescued by the First Detachment of the Zhejiang Water Police at the Taihu Estuary, and several bandits have been arrested and sent to the Changxing County Government for trial. His son Yuan Yuan and grandson Xiao Laohu are still in the bandits' lair.</p>
<p>Letter Demanding Ransom. Jin Qiangui, a farmer in Zhu Mazhuang, Hushu Pass, is well-to-do. He has a son named Shouchun, who is seven years old. Qiangui and his wife love him very much. On the evening of the 18th of last month, at about 12:00 PM, they were suddenly robbed, and Shouchun was kidnapped. Afterwards, the whole family received three letters from the bandits, one stating that they lacked travel expenses, so they took this action, the second demanding 3,000 yuan to redeem the ticket, and the third asking Jin to personally bring the money to Zhenru Station in Shanghai by the 11:00 AM train the day before yesterday to redeem the ticket, explaining that after getting off the train, he should walk east along the motor road, and someone would come to contact him. The matter was detected by the detectives of the Second District of the River Police, who reported to the District Director Zhou Weilie. The director then ordered the detectives Ma Baisheng, Mao Wenlong, Shao Henglong, Wang Zhen, etc. to invite the client and give them the opportunity.</p>
<p>Three Bandits Arrested. The detectives first came to Shanghai to ask the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Zhenru Public Security Sub-bureau for assistance. By about 3:00 PM, the time stipulated in the bandits' letter had arrived. The detectives disguised themselves and arranged the scene. Then, they instructed Jin to follow the indicated direction. About 300 meters away, one person in short clothes and two people in long gowns came forward to contact Jin. After about two minutes, the detectives drew their guns and surrounded the bandits. The bandits knew they had failed and ran away along the motor road towards Shanghai. The detectives also chased closely. The three bandits changed their plan and turned to the wasteland behind Jinan University to escape. Before they could take a dozen steps, a small river blocked them. In desperation, the bandits jumped into the river to escape. The police immediately dispersed on both sides of the river and captured the three bandits in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Hostages. After the three bandits were arrested, they were taken to the Zhenru Public Security Sub-bureau for detention. According to the bandits, the ticket was hidden in a large boat next to the bamboo raft at Yongning Bridge outside Loumen in Suzhou. In addition to temporarily handing over the two bandits, Guo Kuangsheng and Liu Ziming, to the sub-bureau for custody, the detectives took Wang to Suzhou by express train that night. At about 9:00 PM that night, they rescued the two hostages, Jin Zishouchun and Ni Mubao's grandson Ah Er (Xiao Laohu), from Yongning Bridge outside Loumen, as well as Ouyang Renfu, who was in charge of "the boat" and "the ticket," and seized two pistols and one boat. They are still being interrogated by the Detective Team. It is expected that they will be sent to Suzhou for trial the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>Payment of 500 yuan allows for the reservation of a house to be built.</p>
<p>Attention is fortunately given to the general salaried class.</p>
<p>The Rose Garden New Village, established by the China New Village Construction Society, is scheduled to begin construction on December 9th. The second phase of the popularization plan will be launched in advance to meet the urgent needs of the general salaried class. Details were published in this newspaper on the 24th. It is now known that the popularization plan will be officially announced today. The designed houses are divided into two grades, D and E, with a uniform base of five fen. The houses are of the latest construction. Grade D has seven rooms, and Grade E has five rooms, all surrounded by gardens. Each grade of house has two styles. The figure below shows the first style of Grade D. This plan is designed for those who pay a monthly rent of 50 to 90 yuan for urban housing. The fixed construction cost of Grade D houses is 600 yuan, with monthly installments ranging from 73 to 88 yuan. The fixed construction cost of Grade E houses is 500 yuan, with monthly installments ranging from 51 to 62 yuan. The term for obtaining ownership is from two to thirteen years.

<p>Lung disease is an unresolved problem for both Western and traditional Chinese medicine in the 20th century. Therefore, there are many researchers, but few who can truly treat it. Recently, Mr. Feng Zijun, a revolutionary predecessor from a Yunnan family, has been researching lung diseases for many years and has developed a special medicine for treating lung diseases with miraculous effects. Even in the third stage, after treatment, all cases are brought back to life. In recent years, he has traveled to various provinces with the army, curing countless cases of lung disease. Therefore, contemporary celebrities have called him the "Great Medicine King." Now, in response to requests for consultations in Shanghai, friends have strongly urged him to practice medicine to save the masses. Mr. Feng reluctantly agreed and has now established a clinic at No. 23 Siming Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Luber. He will officially begin consultations on the 28th of this month. Previously, when Mr. Feng participated in the Northern Expedition, he served as a counselor in the First Route General Headquarters under Commander-in-Chief He, stationed in Nanjing. The number of patients was endless, and his reputation was universally praised. He is truly a dawn for the medical community and a savior for lung diseases.</p>
<h3 id="e146">French Police Seize a Large Quantity of Red Pills <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>At No. 9 Rue Auliff</p>
<p>Ganslin (transliteration), a Western detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession, and Chinese detective Ma Zhongrong, were patrolling the Chenjiabang area of Chengdu Road at 1 PM the day before yesterday when they saw a group of people acting suspiciously. Upon searching them, they found a package of red pills, totaling thirty-six, in their pockets. They were immediately taken to the police station. Interrogation revealed that his name was Wu Heshang, 27 years old, a local resident living at No. 9 Rue Auliff in the French Concession. He admitted to selling drugs. The detectives immediately took Wu to the French Police Station and reported the situation. Western detective Pu Quegu (transliteration), along with detective Cao Fuchang, deputy detective Wang Anming, and detective Jiang Huchen, rushed to the location and arrested a woman, Wu Zhou (25 years old, a local resident). Inside the house, they seized sixteen packages of red pills, each containing one thousand pills, totaling sixteen thousand pills. Interrogation revealed that the red pills were delivered by Qin Kun'gen (37 years old, a local resident), an accomplice living at No. 18 Rue Lanweiai. The detectives immediately rushed to the address and arrested Qin. Qin further stated that the red pills belonged to Ni Agou, the owner of the front building at No. 13 Huabao Lane, Huanghe Road, who manufactured them himself using a machine. The Chinese and Western detectives rushed to Huabao Lane to arrest Ni, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. According to Qin's statement, the manufacturing machine was located in the back building at No. 13 Liuhe Lane, Huanghe Road. They rushed to search it but only found two sieves used for making pills. Nothing else was found. Wu Zhou and Qin, along with the red pills and sieves, were taken to the police station and yesterday were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court. Judge Xiong conducted a preliminary hearing. Because the police investigation was not complete, they requested a postponement. After questioning the defendants, the judge ordered them to be remanded in custody and granted a postponement for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Discord Between Japanese Department Stores and Small Capital Shops <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants Opposing Each Other</p>
<p>The Authorities Have No Way to Adjudicate</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Daily News," the Shenjiawan Industrial Department Store previously established a restaurant department, which caused discord with the Japanese restaurant industry association in the city. The association, from the standpoint of protecting its interests, discussed countermeasures. However, employees of the Industrial Department Store sent threats to the restaurant association, which further angered the association. They filed a complaint with the Consul General. The Industrial Department Store also planned to establish a barber shop and, with a somewhat forceful attitude, clashed with the barber industry. As a result, the conflict between the association members and the department store intensified. Last night, both sides held emergency meetings to discuss countermeasures. This is because of the sluggish economy, which makes it difficult for small-capitalists in various industries to survive due to the competition from department stores. Department stores are generally cheaper than other stores in any area. For example, beer is sold for 48 cents per bottle at the department store, while it is sold for 70 cents at restaurants. As a result, the operation of small capital is greatly affected. This type of opposition has become a social problem in Japan. Unfortunately, it has now occurred between Japanese merchants in Shanghai. The outcome of the dispute is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Daily News," the Industrial Department Store has been established for one year. The most developed business of the store is the dining room, which averages around 6,500 yuan per day. The reason for its development is that the goods in the various affiliated departments are cheaper than those of ordinary independently operated small shops. For example, beer, sake, and sukiyaki (beef, bird, and fish hot pot) are particularly cheap, which caused conflict with the association. Both sides have their own arguments, and the Japanese authorities have no way to adjudicate. However, the cheap goods in the department store's dining room are due to the slightly cheaper wholesale prices, so the retail prices are also lower, which cannot be compared with stores that seek excessive profits.</p>

<p>Chen Zhao, a widow from Zhenjiang residing at No. 80 Xiamen Road, had a daughter named Qiaoyun, 29 years old, with some beauty. Since childhood, she had been betrothed by her mother to the Wang family in her hometown as a daughter-in-law. However, recently, the girl's heart had opened, and she had fallen in love with Liu Shude in Shanghai, and they had made a vow of lifelong commitment. This made her very dissatisfied with the marriage arranged by her mother. A few days ago, she received a notice from the Wang family stating that they would choose an auspicious day for the wedding. Chen Zhao then told her daughter to quickly prepare her luggage and return to her hometown to fulfill the wedding ceremony. Upon hearing this, the girl was filled with resentment and suddenly had thoughts of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide. Her mother caught a glimpse of her but it was too late. She was already moaning in bed. She was immediately sent to Guangren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the Laozha Police Station, and detective Xie Guisheng went to investigate. He then took the body to the Ferry Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, accompanied by medical examiner Wei and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Interrogation of Chen Zhao, the deceased's mother, revealed the previous situation. Guo concluded that the deceased, Chen Qiaoyun, a female, had died from opium poisoning. The body was released to her mother, Chen Zhao, who signed a statement to take it back for encoffining.</p>

<p>One Injured in a Fall, Two Burned</p>
<p>Liu Mingxing, a 45-year-old blind man from Hubei, residing at No. 163 Yuanchang Road, Hongkou, made a living by lending money at usurious rates. Yesterday morning at around 5:30 AM, a fire broke out because a tenant downstairs was careless with fire. The fire quickly spread. The fire department rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. As a result, one shop was burned down. When the fire was raging, Liu jumped from the building and broke his leg and fractured his back. His wife, Yu (46 years old), was burned all over her body. Also a girl, one of two landlords, was rescued from the fire but suffered burns to her head and hands. She was taken to the Shanghai Sanatorium by ambulance.

<h3 id="e152">Ninety-Eight Members of the Lawyers' Association Suggest Maintaining the Committee System Temporarily <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, due to an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to amend its articles of association and restore the president-council system prior to the Republic of China year 16, has convened six general membership meetings, but each time the quorum was not met and the meeting was adjourned. It was decided to postpone the meeting for three weeks. However, ninety-eight current members have jointly proposed to maintain the provisions of the provisional articles of association regarding the committee system, and have requested that the resolution be decided by the general meeting and submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for temporary approval to continue its use. The original text is transcribed below. Case: This Association received the Instruction No. 3517 from the Shanghai District Court, transferred by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating that the China Rule of Law Promotion Society reported that the Shanghai Lawyers' Association adopted the committee system, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 26 of the Lawyers' Regulations. It is requested that the Association be ordered to comply with the amendment. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association, due to special circumstances, previously presented a request to temporarily implement the committee system. Since it was a temporary expedient measure, it should still follow Article 26 of the Lawyers' Regulations and be amended. After receiving the above instruction, this Association formulated an amendment and included it in the agenda, convening a general membership meeting to submit it for discussion. However, the meeting failed to be convened five consecutive times, resulting in no resolution on this matter. The members stated that after this Association requested and was approved to implement the committee system, the Association's affairs have been progressing daily for eight years. Examining the past history, the work efficiency during the committee system was actually much higher than during the president system. The facts are all there and can be reviewed. Therefore, from the standpoint of this Association, there is absolutely no need to feel the necessity of amendment. Moreover, this Association has many members and heavy affairs, which cannot be compared with other associations. The special circumstances of changing to the committee system still exist. Since the announcement of the amendment, six meetings have been convened, but none have been successful. The direction of people's hearts can be measured. Since the Ministry of Judicial Administration temporarily approved the adoption in the past due to special circumstances, it must be able to appreciate the sentiments of the people and temporarily approve the continued adoption today, when the special circumstances still exist. Is it appropriate? Please decide. Proposers: Ding Zheming, Ding Qiwu, Wang Youling, Dong Kang, Zhang Yaozeng, Wu Kaisheng, Shen Junru, Wang Weizhen, Shi Liang, Chen Tingrui, Wu Guotai, Li Ming, Ge Zhiqin, Xu Wenrong, Yu Zhongluo, Li Shirui, Shan Yuhua, Xu Zuoliang, Che Bingrong, Zhu Fuju, Zhou Shiying, Yu Qinxiang, Yu Yuan, Guo Shouyi, Zheng Wentong, Yang Yuan, Pan Xi, Pan Zhensheng, and ninety-eight others signed and sealed.</p>

<p>Submitted a Request to the Municipal Government to Allocate Funds for Purchasing Rice</p>
<p>The weather has been dry this year, and the autumn harvest is expected to be poor. Not only are farmers suffering losses, but the future of the people's food supply is also greatly affected. Currently, the authorities in various provinces and cities are taking advantage of the autumn grain harvest to manage warehouses and store grain. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs in this city has also repeatedly forwarded central government instructions to pay attention to the people's food supply. Therefore, it has formulated measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. According to Zhou Minggang, the director of the Food and Beverage Section of the Bureau, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, this city is a major industrial and commercial hub, and the issue of the people's food supply is of great importance. Although it is now the autumn grain harvest season, rice prices continue to rise. According to current market prices, each shi has risen to 13.5 yuan. If calculated in haihus, it will be around 18 yuan. By next spring, rice prices will inevitably rise further. The Bureau has now submitted a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds for purchasing rice to regulate the people's food supply. If the Municipal Government can allocate the funds, it plans to purchase rice in rice-producing areas in the country, such as Hunan and Jiangxi, or to purchase from rice-producing countries abroad. Once the Municipal Government approves, it will proceed actively.</p>

<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market Winter Price Reduction: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market on the north side of the Tianhou Palace Bridge in this city implements production and sales cooperation, so the prices of various daily necessities sold are surprisingly low, which cannot be matched by other places. During this winter price reduction period, it is a true sacrifice. Recently, a large batch of new-style silk cloth clothing materials and various seasonal goods have been shipped in, and two leather goods stove parts have been newly opened on the second floor, all sold at the lowest prices. Those who want to add winter clothing and winter supplies, this is a rare good opportunity.</p>
<p>Shengsheng Pasture Business Advances Rapidly: Shengsheng Pasture, run by Chinese people, is a large-scale pasture created by Shen Jiucheng, the founder of Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. The precision of the equipment and the thoughtfulness of the service are comparable to those run by foreigners. Shen, in view of promoting national goods and reversing the outflow of foreign goods, has expanded its business this winter. Since the new method of preferential treatment for long-term customers was introduced last month, the number of fixed customers has been increasing day by day. The 1,200-pound steam sterilizer was insufficient, and a new sterilizer with a capacity of 1,800 pounds was installed last week, working day and night to avoid the trouble of demand exceeding supply. The current daily production has reached more than 3,500 pounds. Fixed customers who subscribe for more than one year enjoy a 30% discount and receive two free fruit cakes worth 2.4 yuan. It is reported that since last month, more than 4,000 of these fruit cakes have been given away, which shows the rapid progress of the business. The articles of association and price list will be sent immediately upon request. It is reported that it will end at the end of the month. The business department of the factory is at 175 Daxi Road. The original telephone number was 20486, and a new telephone number, 2Ren099, has been added, which is the easiest to remember.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao: Recently, there have been cases of throat ailments. Going to bed earlier and drinking a cup of salt water in the morning, and drinking a decoction of sliced radish (both green and white varieties) instead of tea during the day, can quickly eliminate the symptoms even at the onset. It is advisable for everyone to take preventative measures to avoid this ailment. I respectfully request that your esteemed newspaper publish this to promote it, which would be a great service.

<h3 id="e169">Suggestions for Improving Labor Education in Wuxi and Shanghai <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Ministries of Industry and Education have Ordered the Directors of Wuxi and Shanghai to Take Note</p>
<p>The Ministries of Industry and Education previously sent section chiefs Yang Fang and Zhong Lingxiu to inspect the implementation of labor education in Wuxi and Shanghai and to guide the organization of labor education experimental zones in both locations. Yan Shenyu (Wuxi), Pan Gongzhan (Shanghai), and others were appointed as chairmen of the steering committees for the labor education experimental zones in their respective areas. Section chiefs Yang and Zhong will present their inspection findings to the two ministries. Recently, the two ministries copied and forwarded the inspection report to Chairman Yan Shenyu (Wuxi) and Chairman Pan Gongzhan (Shanghai), instructing them to take note. The following are excerpts from the report regarding suggestions for improving the implementation of labor education in Wuxi and Shanghai:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, some of the labor education practices in Wuxi and Shanghai are effective and worthy of emulation, while others are poorly implemented and urgently need improvement. Several issues are detailed below: (1) "The steering committee for the labor education experimental zone should be organized quickly to serve as a central agency for promoting, guiding, and improving labor education." In Wuxi and Shanghai, those involved in labor education operate independently, without a unified central agency for guidance, planning, evaluation, and supervision. Although the Ministry has long promulgated the "Outline for the Implementation of Labor Education," providing some direction, the lack of supervision and evaluation has led to procrastination, hesitation, or the use of excuses to avoid implementation. It is imperative to establish the steering committee as soon as possible to serve as a central agency for guiding and supervising labor education in the area. This will allow for the establishment of specific measures, strict correction of errors, and the gradual implementation of well-regulated practices, leading to unobstructed progress and tangible results. (2) "Labor education provided by factories should focus on the workers themselves." Some factories in Wuxi and Shanghai provide labor education that complies with the provisions of Article 1 of the "Outline for the Implementation of Labor Education," aiming to enhance the knowledge and skills of the workers themselves. However, the majority run schools for the children of workers, while regarding the education of the workers themselves as optional and allowing them to make their own decisions. This violates the original intention of the "Outline for the Implementation of Labor Education" promulgated by the two ministries and should be corrected by encouraging factories to change their erroneous concepts and focus on improving labor education for workers. (3) "Factories should be required to develop plans for the phased implementation of labor education." Most of the labor schools or labor classes run by factories in Wuxi and Shanghai are perfunctory and lack planning. Furthermore, those that have not been established account for 70-80% of all factories. Factories should be urged to develop plans for phased implementation, allowing for periodic evaluation to achieve universalization and complete success. (4) "The curriculum of labor schools should be implemented separately in accordance with regulations." Article 5 of the "Outline for the Implementation of Labor Education" clearly stipulates the curriculum for labor schools or labor classes. However, an investigation of the labor schools run by factories in Wuxi and Shanghai reveals that the curriculum is often arbitrarily reduced, with students selecting only one or two subjects or adding irrelevant subjects. This is improper and should be corrected by urging factories to follow the regulations and teach the subjects separately, without arbitrary additions or subtractions. (5) The labor education department of the Experimental Public School attached to the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute in Wuxi and the public education center in the south gate of the city have well-planned and well-managed programs that can serve as models for those involved in labor education. Factories should be instructed to pay attention to emulate them to make improvements.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Minister of Education Wang Shijie Discusses the Purpose of the National Labor Exhibition <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education will compile a comprehensive list of the achievements of this year's National Vocational School and Elementary and Secondary School Labor Courses. The first item on the list is Minister Wang's discussion of the purpose of the achievements exhibition, followed by statistics on the types of exhibits and various charts, etc. The full text of Minister of Education Wang Shijie's discussion on the purpose of the National Vocational School and Elementary and Secondary School Labor Course Achievements Exhibition is recorded below:</p>
<p>In recent years, the government, recognizing the discrepancy between past educational facilities and the actual lives of the people, has been striving to correct this. In the educational goals announced by the central government, it has repeatedly emphasized cultivating the spirit of hard work and endurance among the people and enhancing their productive skills. The educational implementation measures promulgated by the government also identify "labor," "production," and "practicality" as the core of education at all levels. As a result, "manual training" in general schools is gradually being regarded as equally important as "brain training," and vocational education is gradually being regarded as equally important as general education in the entire educational system. In order to implement the central government's educational policies, the Ministry of Education has, in recent years, been actively paying attention to the establishment of labor courses in elementary and secondary schools, while also striving to improve vocational education throughout the country. For example, it has formulated standard measures for the establishment and funding of secondary schools in various provinces and cities in order to determine the proportion of vocational education funding and correct the past bias towards general secondary schools; it has stipulated procedures for promoting vocational education in various provinces, cities, and counties in order to determine the steps for implementation; it has formulated outlines for the registration and training of vocational school teachers in various provinces and cities in order to improve the quality of teachers; and it has promulgated outlines for the teaching subjects and hours of vocational schools, as well as outlines for the curriculum and equipment of vocational schools in order to show teaching standards, etc. These are all facilities that the Ministry of Education has been striving to promote vocational education in recent years.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation to determine whether the recent achievements of various provinces and cities in promoting vocational education have reached the minimum standards expected by the government and whether they have realized the progress that is factually possible in each province and city. This year, the Ministry of Education has designated regions and assigned special commissioners to inspect vocational education and conduct on-site assessments. However, due to limitations in manpower and time, it has not been possible to conduct universal and detailed inspections, and the focus has been on the execution of laws and general conditions, with little detailed examination of actual teaching achievements. The purpose of holding this National Vocational School and Elementary and Secondary School Labor Course Achievements Exhibition is to review the actual achievements of vocational education and labor training in elementary and secondary schools in various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>This exhibition is an innovation in the history of education in our country and will have a significant impact on vocational education and labor training in elementary and secondary schools in the future. However, the colleagues of the Ministry of Education absolutely do not want to have the slightest exaggeration or embellishment. For this exhibition, we hope that it can meet the following conditions: First, it can represent the general achievements of ordinary times, rather than specially made products made temporarily; second, it can display scientific technology; third, it has practical value and can reflect the unity of school work and social production. Whether the exhibits actually meet the above conditions is something we hope visitors will carefully observe, and we especially hope that the results of their observations will be revealed to us so that those engaged in educational administration and school work can determine the path for future improvement.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, Central News Agency, 26th) The Ministry of Education's funding for the National Academic Work Advisory Office is 1,000 yuan per month, totaling 9,000 yuan for the current year. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has approved the expenditure from the education and culture fee item. The National Government has recently ordered the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to separately instruct the financial, educational, and auditing departments to take note.</p>

<p>Details of the Anhui Provincial Domestic Education Inspection Delegation's continuous visits to Shanghai have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the entire delegation departed from their residence at the Oriental Hotel at 8 AM yesterday morning in two public buses. They first visited the World Book Company's main factory. The manager, Mr. Lu Shangyi, explained the history, current situation, and future direction of the company.

The second group visited the Twenty-Second Society and Daxia University. The third group visited the China Vocational School, the China Vocational Education Society, and went to the National Educational Film Promotion Office and Kodak Company to inquire about film matters in order to actively promote film teaching in social education after returning to Anhui. The head of the delegation, Director Yang Lian of the Anhui Education Department, gave a lecture at the Anhui Middle School in this city at 8 AM and at Daxia University at 4 PM, so he did not accompany them on the visit. In the evening, the Da Dong Book Company hosted a banquet for the entire delegation at the Bankers' Association, inviting education experts Shen Pengfei, Dong Renjian, Chen Kemei, and Li Ximou to accompany them.

<h3 id="e176">City Education Association Requests the Aviation Association to Continue Handling Aviation Donations <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Association Will Also Continue to Raise Funds to Purchase the Shanghai School No. 2 Aircraft</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association has made considerable efforts to raise funds for aviation donations. Last year, it pioneered the purchase of the Shanghai School aircraft. This initiative prompted various organizations to make successive efforts, leading to the appearance of aircraft such as the Shanghai Merchant and Shanghai Worker. However, since this year, the aviation donation movement has gradually declined. The association believes that this movement should continue to be pursued unceasingly in order to avoid being criticized for a five-minute fever and to strengthen national defense. Therefore, it has decided to continue raising funds to purchase the Shanghai School No. 2 aircraft and has sent a letter to the China Aviation Association requesting it to continue handling aviation donations. An excerpt of the original letter is recorded below: Respected Sir, It has been investigated that the Aviation Association's aviation donations have been able to accumulate small amounts to prepare aircraft for national defense, and the results are gratifying. However, our country has a vast territory and must have a large number of aircraft installed and equipped to consolidate air defense and defend the country without any worries. Moreover, now that military reduction negotiations have broken down, imperialists are sharpening their swords and preparing for a second world war. All of our people must be inspired and excited, catch up quickly, and donate aircraft to help the government strengthen its air defenses in order to fulfill our national duties. In view of this, our association has submitted a discussion at the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and it has been decided that holding aviation donations is an urgent matter. In addition to our association having previously donated the Shanghai School No. 1 aircraft, we should continue to raise funds to purchase the Shanghai School No. 2 aircraft, and it has been unanimously resolved to urge your association to continue handling aviation donations to benefit national defense. This record is filed for your reference and action, and we hope to receive a reply.</p>

In past investigations of various schools, there has often been a lack of attention to this, causing students to be rejected at graduation due to procedures not meeting requirements, and the schools are at a loss as to why. The impact is not small. In view of this, and in order to remedy the situation, this bureau has formulated a student registration card for each school's self-use. Please imitate and apply it yourself. However, if the original method used is indeed excellent, it can also be used as a reference for improvement, to achieve perfection. The cards must be completed within one month of the arrival of this document. This bureau will send personnel to the schools at any time for spot checks. This order is for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Director of Gansu Education Department Shui Zi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Will Return to Nanjing Tonight</p>
<p>Shui Chuqin, Director of the Gansu Education Department, went to Beijing a few days ago to attend an inspection meeting, and to ask the educational authorities for instructions on policy direction and to raise local education funding. After completing his official duties, he and a secretary took the overnight express train to Shanghai the night before, arriving at the station at 8 AM yesterday morning and staying at the East Asia Hotel. A reporter from the Kwok Man News Agency met Mr. Shui at the hotel yesterday. According to him, he had no other tasks than to visit friends. However, he recently read a report about Tao Xingzhi's popularization of national education, which had very good methods. He would very much like to talk to him about it. If it is economical and effective, it would be very appropriate to try it in Gansu Province, as Gansu Province is poor and the people are poor, and the economy is extremely strained. All facilities have no way to start. He has repeatedly submitted to the Central Government requesting resignation, but has not been approved. However, while in office, he will still be responsible for everything. This trip south has received a lot of sympathy from the authorities for the request to allocate local education funding, who believe that this is an urgent matter at present. If nothing is done to improve or force education, the large number of out-of-school children in Gansu Province, which account for 10% of the population, will be a major hidden worry for the future of the nation. It is reported that Mr. Shui will not stay in Shanghai for long and will take the express train to Beijing tonight and then return to the province to preside over the department's affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Huang's Chuanjing Study Offers Western Books <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>A Good Opportunity to Enrich the Library</p>
<p>Huang's Chuanjing Study, due to the expansion of its collection of Chinese classics, intends to transfer its collection of three major Western magazines, regardless of their original value, to domestic public and private libraries for safekeeping, or to exchange them for useful books. These include: (1) The China Economic Monthly, published by the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, a total of 84 volumes from the first issue to the end of last year. The contents all explore the production and sales of local products, as well as import and export statistics over the years, and major works on social economy. It is truly an important modern publication in our country. (2) The Chinese Science and Art Magazine, a total of 120 thick volumes from the first issue to the end of last year. It contains many translations of ancient and modern Chinese codes, poems, prose, novels, as well as inscriptions and techniques for appreciating fine objects. Each issue also has dozens of valuable color and monochrome pictures. (3) The Geographical Magazine published by the American Geographical Society, a total of 174 thick volumes from 1918 to June 1932. Each volume has one or two hundred color and monochrome photographs, and the text is mostly descriptive with little theory, all photographed and written by people who have experienced the situation firsthand, which is by no means comparable to those who construct theories behind closed doors. Regarding the situation in our border areas and inland areas, there are often detailed records, and many writers in various countries have adopted and compiled them as material for geographical books. The above three types are still being published and are all in perfect condition. If libraries or individuals wish to obtain a large number of reference books, they can write to Mr. Huang Qingzhi at the Accounting Department, Room 14, 3rd Floor, Shanghai Post Office for consultation.</p>

<p>Last Night Both Groups Were One-Sided</p>
<p>Since the opening of Xiqing Basketball, interest has been weak. Last night, both games in Group A were one-sided: (1) Nanxing defeated Chizhi, 76 to 21; (2) Mailing defeated Qingguang, 60 to 21. Tonight, the two games in Group A, Jinan versus the Xiqing Pirates, should break the dull atmosphere. Jinan can be called outstanding among the Chinese teams, and there should be a fierce battle at that time. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan　versus　Xiqing　Group A　7:15 PM</p>
<p>Jiangwan　versus　Yeshi　Group A　8:15 PM</p>
<p>Nanxing Defeats Chizhi: Nanxing was as lively as a dragon, and their passing and shooting were very impressive. Chizhi had no defensive strategy, let alone offense. The whole game was controlled by Nanxing, who roamed freely and unscrupulously. In the first half, it was 27 to 5. In the second half, Chizhi once made efforts and scored more points, but the result was 76 to 21, and Chizhi was defeated.</p>
<p>Nanxing　Shots　Free Throws　Fouls　Points　Chizhi　Shots　Free Throws　Fouls　Points</p>

<p>Nanxing Second Half 49 Chizhi 16 Total 9 3 6 21</p>
<p>Mailing Defeats Qingguang: Qingguang is past its prime and no longer mighty. The entire team relies on Dong Xiaopei alone to score points. Unexpectedly, the referee was overly aggressive and imposed arbitrary penalties. Little Dong was ejected in the first half. Mailing came on strong, and with their height and strength, they had the advantage everywhere. Qingguang had almost no resistance. The first half was 37 to 9, and the final result was 60 to 21.</p>

<p>Hope is the bud; many great careers are built because hope sprouts and grows.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Risheng Building <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The most prosperous place in China is naturally Shanghai. The most prosperous place in Shanghai is naturally Nanjing Road in the British Concession, also known as Great Horse Road. Speaking of the prosperous center of Great Horse Road, I think it should be Risheng Building.</p>
<p>That's right, Risheng Building is at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, and directly south is Hubei Road. If you take an aerial photo of Risheng Building from an airplane, I think the intersecting Nanjing and Zhejiang Roads, plus Hubei Road, might actually look like five winding dragons. Risheng Building is a teahouse with a very long history, originally called Five Dragons Risheng Building. Today, people simply call it Risheng Building and don't mention Five Dragons, which is a big mistake.</p>
<p>Risheng Building occupies a pivotal position in the north-south and east-west transportation hub. All kinds of vehicles and pedestrians come and go in large numbers, so some people say that at least 100,000 people pass by Risheng Building every 24 hours. Although there is no precise statistical evidence for this, in my opinion, this number may still be an underestimate.</p>
<p>The Sincere and Wing On department stores face each other across from Risheng Building, and Wing On is still building a new building between Zhejiang and Hubei Roads. After its completion, this prosperous center of Shanghai will naturally become more magnificent. But I hope that the area near the east corner will permanently maintain its original state. One reason is to permanently preserve the Five Dragons Risheng Building, and the other is that I fear that if five large buildings are erected, without tobacco, sweets, fruits, snack shops, and everything else, such as sugar-roasted chestnut stalls and pan-fried bun stalls, there will no longer be the ability to attract pedestrians.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Interest of the Window <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Wen</p>
<p>People's temperament is easily affected by the environment, and even the environment can determine people's will. Therefore, Mencius' mother chose her neighbors. For the sake of changing an environment, it will make people feel a new interest. We don't mind the trouble of moving, moving from a larger old residence into a small new residence. In the new residence, there is just enough space for two beds, two tables, and one stool. It can only seat one person, and you can only work on the bed. When walking, you have to learn to walk sideways like a crab. It's so small that it seems a bit annoying. However, the scenery from the window is not bad. The silk vines on the wall spread to the window, hanging down weakly, covering one-third of the window. The trees on Huayuan Road, seen from the window, have very deep and dense green shade. Occasionally, one or two fluttering fallen leaves fly down. The nearby and distant houses appear faintly, quietly, without the creaking of wheels, without the hustle and bustle of people. It's unexpected that bustling Shanghai actually has such a quiet area. In the evening, the twilight shrouds the somber trees. Only one street lamp is like a radiant star. After the lights in the room are turned off, the light from the street lamp shines through the glass, illuminating the wall with a blurred shadow of the silk vines. When I wake up in the morning, the sun shines directly on our window, and the mottled shadows of the trees on the wall are like a silver screen. Another unique feature is the transom, which uses lead sheets instead of glass, with a round hole cut in the middle. The sunlight passes through the round hole, illuminating the wall with an exceptionally bright white circle. This white circle, together with the mottled shadows of the trees, in a frame that is almost entirely black, can also be seen, facing each other, it is truly impossible to tell what is real and what is fake. Gradually, it moves until it disappears. In short, although our new home is small, the interest of the window is not small. The interest of the window can more than compensate for the hardship of the narrow room, so we live here very comfortably.</p>

<h3 id="e204">A Brief History of the Handshake <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhong)</p>
<p>The handshake was originally a European custom, but now it has spread all over the world. In our country, it is also very popular. People, whether old or young, male or female, shake hands with each other when they meet, replacing nods, bows, and cupped-fist salutes. But few people know the origin of the handshake. I will now write down what I heard from a Western friend for everyone to see:</p>
<p>Originally, this event happened in the ancient Western world. At that time, Europeans were brave and straightforward. When going out, they always wore swords at their waists as protective gear. Because people in ancient times occasionally had disagreements in their common life, they had to draw their swords to demonstrate to each other. If one party had a sincere expression of regret, the other party would extend their right hand to shake the other party's hand. If the other party sympathized, they would also extend their right hand to indicate that they were back on good terms.</p>
<p>From this simple historical fact, we can understand the origin of the handshake. However, for modern people, even Europeans, where handshakes originated, this event has become as common as nodding and bowing, without much significance. Only on football fields and tennis courts, when athletes on both sides compete, they look like enemies. When the competition ends, they extend their hands to shake each other, which still has some of the style of the ancient Western Europeans!</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Fawning and Smiling, Holding Up a Lamp to Illuminate Her Haggard Appearance, Driven by a Hungry Stomach, Applying Powder to Learn Flirtation</p>
<p>However, Huanhua misunderstood. He thought that Jia Duocai was admiring his beauty, and he smiled from time to time, biting his shallow lips, and glancing sideways at Jia Duocai with his deep-set eyes. The more Jia Duocai saw those affectations, the more uncomfortable he felt, so he turned his face away and talked to Li Shilian. Yang Huanhua heard that Jia Duocai was a banker, and he was very willing to approach him. He didn't want to, after only saying a few words about their friendship as fellow villagers, Jia Duocai ignored him. Want to connect a little electricity with him? He turned his face away again. Could he walk over and turn his face around? He looked down at his bosom for a while and had an idea. He borrowed a pack of cigarettes placed on the table and held it in his hand, smiling and asking many people, "Does anyone smoke?" Guo Dunpin knew what to do and said to him, "Offer Mr. Jia one." Huanhua didn't wait for him to answer and had already pinched a cigarette with his three thin fingers and sent it to Jia Duocai. At this time, he could no longer refuse and had to stand up and take the cigarette. Huanhua pressed on even harder, reaching into his pocket to take out a box of matches, struck one, and stretched it forward to light Jia Duocai's cigarette. He really didn't expect him to be so polite, so he hadn't put the cigarette in his mouth yet. Huanhua really had that kind of patience, holding a lit match between two fingers, bending slightly, waiting quietly. Only after Jia Duocai held the cigarette in his mouth did he light it for him. The flame of the match was already burning near his fingers. Jia Duocai, seeing his attentiveness, naturally felt a little embarrassed, so he smiled at him and said, "Everyone who comes here is a guest, you don't have to be so polite." He smiled and returned to his seat. Guo Dunpin, sitting on the bed, was a little farther away. He thought to himself, "Old Jia probably hasn't seen him clearly yet, so he's still so indifferent."

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The pervasive tranquility and antique air, the tall, lush trees, and the lack of floral and avian embellishments here are almost entirely natural. How could human effort ever transform them? Unless all the furnishings, flowers, trees, birds, and so forth of the Forbidden City in Beijing were moved here, it would be impossible to conceal their original rustic and empty true face. Even if they could be concealed, it would only amount to applying a layer of cosmetic adornment; their essence could never be altered!</p>
<p>I finally trembled so violently that I could not linger on the veranda and hastily returned to my own chamber.</p>
<p>Four of us slept together in this chamber. Besides my sister and me, there were two other female officials. At that time, all three of them were already sound asleep because the illusions of terror and unease had never invaded their minds. They could easily drift off into peaceful dreams. But what about me? I was still apprehensive, fearing that a great disaster was about to befall us, and I didn't even have the courage to blow out the candle. Although I myself understood that this was a foolishly ridiculous thought, could there really be any unfortunate events in this heavily guarded palace that would befall us? There was no need to doubt; it was absolutely impossible! Moreover, I also knew that at this time, the Empress Dowager was sleeping very comfortably in her palace in the main hall. Since the Empress Dowager felt no fear or unease, then I, as her attendant female official, should naturally not be intimidated in the slightest, striving to emulate her calm demeanor. Why should I continue to be suspicious and torment myself?</p>
<p>In this state of self-contradiction and fluctuating thoughts, I quietly climbed into bed alone. When I first got into bed, I firmly believed that I wouldn't be able to sleep soundly tonight, perhaps not even able to close my eyes. But after tossing and turning in bed for a while, I don't know how I made up my mind, but I actually closed my eyes and slept very comfortably, not even knowing when it was dawn. (184)</p>
<p>Local Customs and Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e207">A Dictionary of Shanghai Vernacular <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai General News Agency</p>
<p>Dialects differ from place to place, and those not born and raised locally often find them difficult to understand. The Shanghai dialect is especially more complex than other dialects. There are quite a few expressions that have sounds but no corresponding written characters. However, there are also some that can be expressed in writing and whose origins can be traced. Here are a few examples, to give a glimpse.</p>
<p>毛病 (Máo bìng) - Fault; bad habit. Commonly used to describe a habit as a fault. The term appears in Huang Shangu's writings: "This is the fault of the people of Jingnan."</p>
<p>關子 (Guān zi) - Crux; key point. It refers to the crucial point of a matter. The term originates from the Book of Tang. When Li Fengji was in power, he had eight close associates, including Zhang Youxin and Li Zhongyan, and another eight who attached themselves to them. All held important positions, and people at the time called them the "Eight Gatekeepers and Sixteen Sons." Anyone seeking a favor had to bribe the "gatekeepers" first before reaching Li Fengji, and then everything would be accomplished. The common expression "賣關子 (mài guān zi)" - to keep someone in suspense - refers to hiding the crucial information and refusing to reveal it. The origin is likely the same.</p>
<p>垃圾 (Lā jī) - Garbage; trash. Formerly written as "拉扱 (lā chā)," referring to accumulated dirt, debris, and filth. However, the Meng Liang Lu (Dream Log Records) mentions "boats carrying garbage and manure on various rivers," indicating that the term has been in use for a long time.</p>
<p>空頭 (Kōng tóu) - Empty; unsubstantial. Refers to something that is empty and lacks substance. Found in the History of the North: Biography of Hülü Jin: "An empty head should be killed."</p>

<p>豬玀 (Zhū luó) - Pig. A term used by Shanghainese to scold people, actually a corruption of "豬婁 (zhū lóu)." Zuo Zhuan: "Once you have settled your female pigs, why not return to find your male pig?"</p>
<p>正經 (Zhèng jīng) - Proper; upright. Refers to not engaging in deception or pursuing wickedness. Book of Songs, chapter on "Gentleman Yang Yang," commentary says: "The constant joy of the royal chamber is the proper way of the wind."</p>
<p>惡 (È) - Excrement. Commonly refers to dung, pronounced with a falling tone. History of the Former Han Dynasty, Biography of the King of Changyi: "Such things are like bluebottle fly dung." Yan Shigu's annotation says: "That is, feces. King Goujian of Yue tasted the excrement for the King of Wu."</p>
<p>頭家 (Tóu jiā) - Banker; owner. Refers to the person who sets up a gambling game to collect a commission. Also called "抽頭 (chōu tóu)" - to take a cut. Tang Yinghua's "Rhapsody on Playing Sugoroku" says: "Seeing those defeated in the game, not acting as the head in the game." Also, Su Dongpo recorded that a young man who gambled and won a thousand gold pieces without losing found a formula that said, "Only ask for the cut." That is, to take a commission.</p>
<p>差路 (Chā lù) - Wrong path. Refers to something that is not proper. Tang poetry says, "There are many wrong paths in front of the Pine Tree Rock."</p>
<p>擡舉 (Tái jǔ) - To lift up; to support. Refers to assisting. Bai Letian's poem "High Lotus": "Standing tall, lifting itself up."</p>
<p>打孛 (Dǎ bèi) - To tease; to play tricks on. Commonly written as "打棚 (dǎ péng)," referring to making fun of others to amuse oneself. Wu Xia Proverbs couplet: "Let you come to tease."</p>
<p>薄相 (Báo xiàng) - To play around; to amuse oneself. Commonly written as "白相 (bái xiàng)," also written as "孛相 (bèi xiàng)," a common vernacular in Wu region, meaning to play around. Huang Shangu's letter to Elder Fan says: "Han Shi goes to the neighboring school every day, just to protect his play." Also, Zhao Xianyou's poem "Visiting Mount Hua and Sending to Yuan Yuzhi": "The mountain gods also play tricks on people."</p>
<p>黄六 (Huáng liù) - Fake; false. Refers to something that is deceptive and not real. Shen Zinan's Yilin Hui Kao (Collected Examinations of the Forest of Arts) says: "Huang Chao walked sixth and was often deceitful, so those who deceive people are called Huang Liu."</p>
<p>交關 (Jiāo guān) - Very much; a lot. Commonly refers to something that is extremely numerous, from Jin Shu, Biography of Pei Xiu: "Dealing with numerous human affairs."</p>
<p>温暾 (Wēn tūn) - Lukewarm. Refers to something that is warm but not very hot. Bai Letian's poem "Kaiyuan Temple": "The pool water is warm and lukewarm"; also Wang Jian's Palace Poem: "The new clear grass color is warm and lukewarm."</p>
<p>作人情 (Zuò rén qíng) - To give a gift; to do someone a favor. Refers to giving someone something as a gift, from Du Gongbu's poem "Fried cakes as gifts."</p>

<p>乾癟 (Gān biě) - Dried up; withered. Refers to something that is dry and withered, found in Qi Xiu Lei Lan (Seven Repairs Classified Orchid) poetry, "The prime minister does business, only uses Huang Cai leaves, the west wind rises overnight and dries up."

<p>欵乃 (Kuǎn nǎi) - Sound of oars. Pronounced like "ǎi ǎo," the sound made by a porter when carrying a heavy load, or the sound of oars, either responding to oneself or responding to each other. Originally a boatman's song, Zhu Xi distinguished it as: "The oars of the boat match each other," now people call it in reverse by mistake.</p>
<p>連忙 (Lián máng) - Hastily; hurriedly. Refers to being eager to complete work. Zhu Xi's Collected Poems: "Hurry to add thatch to the roof, quickly finish the field."</p>
<p>㜘 (Chū) - Good; beautiful. Shanghainese call something beautiful as "㜘 (chū)," pronounced like "wū." Ji Kang's "Rhapsody on the Qin": "Or complains and hesitates."</p>

<p>Rumor of Abolishing Equalization Tax</p>
<p>Gold Market Suddenly Plunges</p>
<p>Closing at 1002.7 Yuan</p>
<p>A Drop of 13.9 Yuan</p>
<p>Following the surge in the gold market since the end of last week, with fervent buying, yesterday's market suddenly had rumors of abolishing the equalization tax. People were abuzz, causing sentiment to turn weary and the price of gold to fall, nearly approaching the 1,000 yuan mark. It was found that in the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US were uniformly down, and forward silver prices also decreased by 4.5%. Exchange rates also narrowed. London spot gold rose by one penny. In off-market pre-trading, the opening price rose to 18 or 19 yuan. Ding, Fuxing, Yongshen, Kang, and others took advantage of the high price to sell, and the market immediately went down. The Central Bank's listing revealed that the UK and US were both flat, the Customs gold unit rose by one li, and the standard gold price also rose to 1003.9 yuan, which had little impact. The morning opened with a low price. Although large players came to sell heavily after the opening, there were still enthusiastic buyers, and the price seemed to rise again. Before long, however, the banks' appetite remained saturated, and large players continued to sell aggressively, causing sentiment to become weary. Chinese merchants lacked buying appetite, and the domestic market loosened, retreating to within the 10 yuan mark. Although there was support at the low price, and there was contention at the 10 yuan mark, due to the large players such as Senchang, Yongda, Changxiang selling more, the market was oversupplied, gradually going down. Furthermore, there were rumors that the silver equalization tax might be abolished. Buyer sentiment was once timid, and large players such as Yifeng and Yong also came to supply, causing the price of gold to fall further. The announcement of the silver equalization tax was unchanged, still levying 6.25%. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 59375. Sellers felt disappointed, and after falling, the price gradually rose. After entering, Chinese merchants' appetite trended upward, and banks lacked selling appetite. The shilling became even tighter. Sentiment stabilized again. Although there was fluctuation, large players already had buying appetite. The price once broke through the 10 yuan mark outside the range at noon, but the noon closing saw a pullback, and the market was also weary after the closing. In the afternoon market, the market turned from weary to flat. Large players had mixed appetites, so the market situation was extremely unstable at this time, with frequent ups and downs. The initial report of Indian silver rose by two annas, but sentiment remained stable. Although it fell, it was still able to pull up. Before long, the banks still had selling appetite, and the domestic market loosened again. Large players took advantage of the trend to supply, and the rumor of abolishing the equalization tax arose again. Retail investors also had disposals, nearly approaching the 1,000 yuan mark, but the selling wind was temporary. Before long, the price recovered again. The banks slightly bought at the low price. The second report of Indian silver rose by a small one anna, gradually recovering. Finally, it presented a state of hesitation. Throughout the day, sentiment went from firm to hard. There was quite a lot of struggle in the middle. As for the rumor of abolishing the equalization tax, people were abuzz, and the gold market was forced to decline. However, after the equalization tax is abolished, will there be no other unexpected changes? Will the price of gold collapse and be unable to recover? These are all the restraints that are cited in the minds of colleagues. Funds were unexpectedly tightened again, causing the spot market to be extremely weary. General longs were extremely embarrassed, and the spread was even higher. Now, after recording the day's market situation,</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1012.2 yuan, a drop of 4.4 yuan compared to last Saturday. Fuxing Yong aggressively sold, falling to 1 yuan. Dafa and Yongshun Li Lai entered and rose back to 3.5 yuan, but there were many sellers, and the market immediately went down. Sumitomo filled the January US dollar at 875. The British filled the shilling at 9375. Senchang, Yongda, Changxiang, Fuyu, Hongxing, Xin Chang, Qian Changxiang, Dadecheng, and others all sold, falling to 07.5 yuan. Tianfeng, Dalian Gang, Tongyi, and Shangjin rose to 10 yuan. Fuxing Yong Fuyu still sold, and the price dropped to 08 yuan. Shun Li and Yicheng entered, rising to 10 yuan 05 jiao. They learned in advance that HSBC's listing of British and American exchange rates would not move, and sentiment suddenly became weary. Hengyu, Dafa Yong, Hongli, Dachangxiang, Senchang Yong, and Fuchang sold, falling to 7.3 yuan. Fuxing Yong, Zhaofeng Chang, Hengyu Yong Li Lai entered, rising to 9.5 yuan. The British filled the January US dollar already at 33.125 and still fell. North Korea came out with the December shilling at 0625. Yuan Yi, Hengyu, Fuxing Yong, Fuyu, and Dachangxiang came to sell, falling to 5 yuan. Bingxing, Yuqing Yong, and Yicheng took advantage of the low price to enter, rising to 6 yuan. Fuxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Dingkang, and Dafa Yong sold, and the market still saw a downward trend. In addition, Yifeng Yong aggressively sold, and the price fell to 2.8 yuan. The announcement of the silver equalization tax was unchanged, still levying 6.25%. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling 5 pence 59375. Dalian Gang, Tongyi, and Hengxing entered, and the shorts also felt disappointed, rising to outside 6 yuan. Macquarie bought the March shilling at 875. There was still a pullback at this time, but the general trend was stable, struggling around 6 yuan. Afterwards, Hengchu and others entered, and the price rose back to 8.8 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang, Tianfeng Shengda, Dadecheng, and others slightly sold, falling to 6.8 yuan. Shunmao took advantage of the low price to aggressively enter, and Dafa Yong Hengyu and Dadecheng also took in, and the price rose to 10 yuan 05 jiao. Yifeng Yong and others took advantage of the high price to dispose of, and the noon closing retreated to 1008.8 yuan. After the closing, Yifeng Yong and Yuqing Yong were still selling, and the price retreated to within 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1006 yuan. Fuxing Yong Fuchang Zhengchang and others all entered. Mitsui bought the February US dollar at 33 yuan, rising to 7.5 yuan. Senchang Yong Yuqing Yong Dacheng Mao Yong Dafa Yong sold, retreating to 4.5 yuan. The British bought the January shilling at 4 pence. Fuxing Yong Tianfeng Yong Dadecheng Fuyu Dacheng Dachangxiang came to enter, rising to 6.7 yuan. Mumbai rose by 10.10.10 annas. Dingkang Qingyu Dafa Yong Dadecheng Wanxing sold, falling to 3.8 yuan. At this time, Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang Fuxing Yong took in, rising to 6.8 yuan. HSBC filled the March shilling at 75 and was difficult to sell. Qingyu Dadecheng Dafa Yong Fuxing Yong and others continuously supplied, falling to 08 yuan. Changda Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang Yifeng Yong Hengyu Zhengchang and others jointly took in. Although Yuankang Xiang sold, the banks slightly replenished and rose after fluctuation. Mumbai pulled back 1.1.1 annas, gradually rising back to 4.6 yuan. Yuankang Xiang Hongli and others slightly sold, and the closing price retreated to 1002.7 yuan. After the closing, Yuan Maoyong and others slightly took in, sentiment remained stable, rising to above 3.5 yuan, but Hengxing Yuan and others sold heavily and flattened again. It was found that the highest price of the day was 1013.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1000.8 yuan, with a difference of 12.7 yuan. As a result, it fell back 13.9 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the standard gold price listed by the Central Bank, which was 1003.9 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about yuan, about 14 yuan less than last Saturday. The December book entry price was 1006 yuan, and the January price was 1009 yuan. The morning makeup water was 1006 yuan, and the afternoon makeup water was 1000 yuan. The red gold price was 1012.2 yuan. The spot market was still extremely sluggish. With HSBC urging cash deposits, the longs had no buying appetite, so Tianjin goods had been reduced to the same price as the standard gold price, but no deal was made. In addition, it was heard that there were more than 300 taels of transactions, bought in by Dafeng Heng, according to the saying of adding 1.75 yuan. The spread situation was even more panicked for the longs. The banks were unwilling to deposit, and the foreign spread was even higher, so the discount was even higher, and there were still no shorts to respond. As of today, there were 7,630 January forward contracts remaining, with a total of 29 longs and 9 shorts.</p>
<p>The floor trading was chaotic, and some longs came out. In summary, Senchang Yong Yifeng Yong Fuyu Renfa Yong Hengtai Dachangxiang Fuxing Wu Yi Zhaofeng Chang Wu Maoyong Hongxing Yong Dashun Huixiang Yuanchang Yong Fuan Hongli Hengxing Yuan and others were on the selling side. Tongtaichang Yicheng Tongchun Fuxing Yong Xiangfeng Qingfa Yong Yingxiang Dingtai Dacheng Shunmao Tongfu Wuchang Xiang Hengxing Youkang Zhengchang and others were on the buying side. Fuxing Yong Dachangxiang Shenkang Hengyu Hengchang Yong first went out and then came in. Dadecheng Dafa Yong and others first came in and then went out. Dalian Gang Wanxing did a total of more than 1,600 contracts, squeezing in more than 200 contracts. Shunli did a total of more than 1,300 contracts, squeezing in more than 200 contracts. Guang Gang Shengda had little trading. Hengxing entered less than 200, and sold a small number. The total number of transactions on the day was 47,782 contracts in the morning and 28,063 contracts in the afternoon. The total number of January future chips was 26,292 contracts, with a total of 68 longs and 46 shorts.</p>

<p>Tracing back to when the US government raised the price of silver and implemented a silver purchasing policy, the outflow of silver in our country was extremely large, so our government had no choice but to implement an increase in silver export taxes, and at the same time, levied an equalization tax, with the Ministry of Finance instructing the Central Bank to list and announce it daily. The outflow of silver was able to be stopped. Recently, the equalization tax on silver set by the Central Bank is relatively loose, which is because the Ping Shi Committee followed the request of foreign banks to regulate the market. Looking at Saturday, the equalization tax announced by the Central Bank was 6.25%, which was based on the British exchange rate of 1 shilling 5 pence 6875 as the flat price. In terms of the exchange market, the formal transaction of the British exchange rate was 1 shilling 4 pence, with a difference of more than 1.5 pence, which is the difference between the London and Shanghai silver markets. In other words, if the Shanghai banking community loaded silver to the UK, after deducting the taxes to be paid, they could still obtain a gross profit of more than 1.5 pence. Moreover, the payment of the equalization tax has also been changed to be calculated on the date of customs declaration, which is why the banks are happy to load and export. However, foreign banks are still worried that after a unified supply, the local exchange market will suddenly harden, and the overnight British silver will suddenly rise sharply, so there is still hesitation, and the shipment of silver can also be slightly restrained. Recently, it has been thought that the silver tax cannot control the outflow of silver, but they do not know that there is still this reason. In addition, even if the banks do not ship, looking at the standard gold price, they are still leaking almost entirely, so it can be seen that only starting from the currency is not a fundamental solution. In order to clarify the calculation method of the equalization tax for all sectors, the formula is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to the above table, the actual silver equalization tax on the day is found. (Qin)</p>

<p>Foreign Spread as High as Two Jiao Eight Fen</p>
<p>Head Money Actually Raised to Four Jiao Two Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market situation was such that, as it was the beginning of the week, it was necessary to replenish the large amount of deposit money that expired on the weekend and Sunday, so the situation suddenly became tense. The foreign spread market price was two jiao eight fen in the morning and noon markets, an increase of eight fen compared to the end of last week. And the head money plus water, because various due bills and deposit money had to be replenished, and the head money position in the market was lacking, all were paid in cash, so the addition of water rose sharply, initially to two jiao four fen, then changed to three jiao eight fen, and finally to four jiao two fen, with a soaring trend. This is an accidental temporary situation, not related to the overall situation. The number of transactions in spread bills was more than 4.3 million in the morning market for transfers and new transactions, and more than 200,000 in the afternoon market. The total number of transactions in the small association was more than 800,000.

<p>Jiang Jiao Copper Coins Were Both Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiang Jiao small foreign money, in the morning market, once fell by 2 yuan 5 jiao, making 828 yuan 5 jiao, and in the afternoon market, it actually recovered 6 yuan 5 jiao, for 835 yuan. As a result, it rose by 4 yuan compared to the previous day, making a transaction of 4,000 jiao in the morning market and 12,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign money was 746 yuan in the morning market, and it was changed to 746 yuan 2 jiao in the afternoon market.

<p>The Split Interest is High and Public Debt Continues to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, only the December Futures Were Traded</p>
<p>The January Issue is Scheduled to be Listed on the 29th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only traded the December futures for one month, and the November futures have already been stopped, and are allowed to be settled on the 28th. The 24th year January futures, starting from the 29th, will begin to be listed. The market is still falling due to tight money, which is what the reporter expected. Yesterday was Sunday, and the foreign spread was only two jiao, which is because there was no transaction relationship, and it was not that cash suddenly had a source. Yesterday morning, the foreign spread suddenly hung at two jiao eight fen, and it was heard that the financial community had a total of 30 million yuan in loans, so the head money made about four jiao in the afternoon, which is the highest price in many years, and it can also be seen that the cash in the market is short. However, with the soaring foreign split interest in recent days, the market is very dangerous, and beware of reaction. In the shortest term, the foreign split interest is still not easy to return to small, but not too high, and the market price will not rise and fall again. Yesterday, because the foreign split interest rose, and a new high price was seen, the market was soft, and the opening fell by one or two jiao to about half a yuan. The second market was relatively stable, slightly less than one jiao. It is estimated that the general population expects the head money to shrink in the afternoon, but unexpectedly, it was counterproductive, and the highest price of the head money made four jiao two fen, and the closing was three jiao eight fen. There was also a large amount of need in the market, which led to the high price that has not been seen in many years, so the market opened again by one or two jiao to half a yuan in the afternoon, and the closing still did not improve, and it was reduced by another one or two jiao to three jiao and a half. The whole day was falling, with Zhengliu being the most severe, with a sharp advance and quick retreat, which is bound to happen. The buying and selling was dominated by large households selling and retail investors buying, and there are still many waves ahead. The final result of the market price was a drop of four jiao to one yuan and two jiao. The total number of transactions was 15,495,000 yuan. Now, the results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: Hundred Yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e210">Yarn Flowers <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The Market Trend for Yarn Remains Strong</p>
<p>The yarn market experienced a morning dip followed by an afternoon rise, maintaining a strong overall trend. This was due to substantial purchases by the Tongcheng Company, totaling a massive 8,800 bales, which caused a stir in the market. Simultaneously, spot yarn sales saw increased procurement from Sichuan merchants. However, the silver exchange rate remained high at 28%, although there is significant organization within the financial sector, and current support remains robust.</p>
<p>Good Yarn Prices at 23.4 Cents - Trading in Yarn Commences:  The opening market for yarn saw a slight loosening of conditions as foreign cotton prices were weak, and many long positions from the previous day were closed.  Concurrently, gold prices saw a minor rebound, reducing buyer interest in the market.  Prices for various grades of yarn dropped by 4.5, 7, and 9 cents.  In the afternoon, news of activity by Sichuan merchants in the spot yarn market spread, alongside confirmation of Tongcheng Company's massive purchase of 8,800 bales, greatly unsettling the market. Short sellers covered their positions, causing a sudden rise in market prices, ultimately resulting in gains ranging from 6.9 cents to 1.1 cents across all months.  Total trading volume for the day was 31,900 bales. Sales were led by Dafeng with 2,100 bales, Tongsheng with 600 bales, Jifeng with 450 bales, Hengyi with 450 bales, Daji with 1,900 bales, Gengfeng with 4,150 bales, Taichang with 800 bales, Run (blank) with 1,900 bales, Xinchang with 600 bales, Jinchang with 1,350 bales, Hengde with 1,100 bales, and Xincheng with 700 bales. Purchases were led by Dafeng with 1,250 bales, Jifeng with 700 bales, Jinchang with 700 bales, Renfeng with 550 bales, Yida with 600 bales, Changfeng with 4,500 bales, Xincheng with 650 bales, Yicheng with 1,650 bales, Tonghe with 750 bales, and Runkang with 550 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Reach 1,400 Bales: Spot yarn sales remain brisk. Total purchases by various merchants for the day amounted to 1,400 bales, with prices rising by 5 cents. Purchase amounts by various merchants are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan: 405; Inland: 505; Hankou: 25</p>
<p>Guangdong: 145; Ningbo: 30; Wuhu: 20</p>
<p>Northern Merchants: 20; Shantou: 40; Peers: 60</p>
<p>Anqing: 100; Jiangxi: 10; Luzhou: 40</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Reaches New Highs</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rose, with a sudden surge in the afternoon due to tight supplies, a lack of sellers, and depleted arrivals from all regions. Moreover, a portion of the spot cotton is held by the financial sector, making it difficult to ensure sufficient supply in the market.  Consequently, some long positions are gradually being unwound.  Far-month contracts even surpassed 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Contracts See Panic Buying in After-Market Trading: Trading in cotton futures opened lower due to softness in Indian and American cotton markets, and some long positions being unwound from the previous day, causing the market to slightly flatten.  Simultaneously, gold prices also declined, with losses ranging from 5.15 cents to 20 cents across all months.  The market tightened steadily after the afternoon opening, as available contracts were scarce and short sellers aggressively covered their positions.  Far-month contracts reached new peaks, ultimately resulting in gains ranging from 20 cents to 45 cents across all months.  Total trading volume for the day was 125,700 dan. Sales were led by Xincheng with 4,200 dan, Shenji with 1,500 dan, Hengde with 2,100 dan, Changji with 2,000 dan, Dafu with 2,800 dan, Tongji with 1,900 dan, Daji with 2,600 dan, Huikang with 2,700 dan, Gengfeng with 2,200 dan, Changfeng with 5,800 dan, Mingde with 3,300 dan, and Yuan Yi with 1,600 dan.  Purchases were led by Jifeng with 4,200 dan, Jinchang with 1,500 dan, Shenji with 1,500 dan, Changhe with 2,700 dan, Tongji with 1,900 dan, Zhenda with 2,700 dan, Tongxing with 2,100 dan, Yicheng with 2,000 dan, Runkang with 5,800 dan, and Yifeng with 1,900 dan.  The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>High Spot Cotton Prices Curb Mill Appetite: Spot cotton sales are generally flat due to high prices hindering mill demand. However, the high futures prices cause those holding cotton to be reluctant to sell. Source includes 1,200 bales of Tong cotton and 916 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Cotton: 46.50 yuan; Shenxin Factory Intake: 110 pieces; Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton: 35.00 yuan; Baoxing Factory Intake: 100 pieces; Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Private Telegraph from U.S. Indicates Optimism for American Cotton: Maoxin Foreign Firm in this city received a telegram from New York on November 26th stating that cotton market sentiment has improved significantly, overall morale has recovered, confidence has greatly increased, and it is predicted that American cotton prices will rise.</p>
<p>Statistics for October Import of Foreign Cotton to This City</p>
<p>According to a survey by Gao Erting Foreign Firm, the quantity of foreign cotton imported into Shanghai in October of the 23rd year amounted to 79,125 pieces of American cotton, 6,237 pieces of Indian cotton, and 450 pieces of Egyptian cotton.

<p>Southern Rice is Expensive, Northern Rice is Shipped South</p>
<p>This is the First Time... Amounting to 300 Bags</p>
<p>The North is a wheat-producing region, and rice has traditionally been shipped from the South to the North. However, this year, the North has seen an excellent rice harvest. Recently, 300 bags of local rice (what Tianjin residents call rice is actually japonica rice) have been shipped from Tianjin to Shanghai. Samples will be available for viewing today or tomorrow. This is the first instance of northern rice being shipped south.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Also Follow, Dropping Slightly by 6-7 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the morning opening, prices for all months were generally stable, with foreign wheat quoted at around 34 cents higher for Chicago and 23 cents higher for Canada. At the opening, the price of foreign wheat rose, but rumors of a tax increase proved to be unfounded, resulting in a peaceful opening. Short sellers then covered their positions, leading to a slight increase. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, due to the rapid decline in the flour market that morning, market sentiment became extremely weak, leading to a surge in selling pressure and a sharp drop in prices. This volatile situation is entirely dependent on whether or not a tax will be imposed on foreign wheat. Therefore, future price movements cannot be predicted by normal means. As a result, this month's contract fell by 7 cents, December's by 6 cents, January's by 7 cents, and February's by 9 cents. The spot wheat market saw no demand from factories and was quiet.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat, the matter of importing French wheat, has become a thing of the past. The hedging resulting from the fire in the Yamaha warehouse has had an increasingly strong influence on foreign markets, causing prices to rebound. In addition, strong demand for spot goods and unfavorable crop news have contributed to the rise.</p>
<p>Longs Recoup Gains, Floating Shorts Add Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, prices for all months generally showed a sharp decline, with foreign wheat quoted at around 34 cents higher for Chicago and 23 cents higher for Canada. At the opening, the price of foreign wheat rose, and there was a lingering effect from the previous week's surge, leading most people to expect a good outlook. However, the previous week's rise was due to rumors of a tax increase on foreign wheat. Now that this rumor has been proven false, this month's contract opened low at 44 cents, effectively shorting 2.5 cents, and then further declined to 2.25 cents. As a result, forward prices immediately showed volatility, falling by 34 cents. Longs recouped their gains freely, and floating shorts took advantage of the situation to exert selling pressure, presenting a stark contrast to the previous week's situation. When the market opened in the afternoon, the trend stabilized slightly, and trading between both sides became clearer. Many profited from recouping gains, while new longs still entered the market, resulting in a temporary stalemate. As a result, this month's contract fell by 3.5 cents compared to the previous week, December's by 4 cents, February's by 3.5 cents, February's by 3.25 cents, March's by 4.25 cents, and April's by 3.75 cents.</p>
<p>Customer Rice Transactions Gradually Turn Cautious</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the foreign indica market saw continued inquiries from local merchants, but with prices already tight, appetite seemed to be waning. The Jiujiang merchants, who were active the day before yesterday, have now stopped.  Additionally, customer indica rice has continued to arrive in port, with approximately 20,000 new arrivals yesterday and today. Orders for foreign wheat have also continued to arrive. Customer indica weakened slightly by 56 cents, while other prices remained flat. Total of 60 bags of indica rice were opened from various sources yesterday, which were distributed by the local merchants.</p>
<p>Spot foreign rice only opened at 1,800 bags. Futures rice saw Heyi seeking to sell March-April contracts, but price negotiations failed. The entire city only saw 500 tons of recovered goods transacted. The future market is generally bearish. Current stocks of foreign rice are large and digestion has been stagnant, so prices fell slightly by 10 cents yesterday.</p>
<p>Riverfront Rice Market Remains Stable Due to Rain</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the various sources of supply were slightly more abundant, totaling nearly 40 sources with over 6,000 stones of goods. Sales in the local market were sluggish, with only Yantai merchants purchasing over 400 bags. The market sentiment remained soft, and prices for various grades of goods saw no change. Only Duyangjian, same village products, due to stockouts for almost ten days, inevitably saw a slight freshness upon arrival. Other sources remained flat. Although the Yinyuan liquor merchants were still able to move nearly 1,000 bags, they were unwilling to accept small profits, leading to an outwardly withered and internally depleted state, all being tasteless. Prices fell by a small margin.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over ten sources of supply from the riverfront. Market sales were sluggish due to the rain, and prices for all grades of white japonica rice remained stagnant. Market sentiment was similar across the board.</p>

<p>Groundnuts See Initial Surge in Prices</p>
<p>India Peanut Crop Failure... European Sales Recover</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Need are Strong... Land Prices Rising Continuously</p>
<p>Groundnuts plummeted last year, falling from a high of over ten yuan to below three yuan, a rare occurrence in decades. The reason for the decline was the rise of Indian groundnuts as a substitute. As a result, some farmers in Shandong and other places who could grow cotton switched to growing cotton this year. However, this year, India has experienced a severe drought, resulting in a large crop failure of groundnuts. Consequently, Europe must still seek supplies from China. A large quantity of groundnuts stored in Qingdao were sold by Dongyang firms to European merchants. There is still a demand for new groundnuts. Guangdong merchants have also been major customers of groundnuts, especially for groundnut oil, with sales in Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places being particularly high. As a result, producers have been raising prices as Guangdong merchants search for supplies, and arrivals have been scarce, further strengthening prices. Land prices in Xuzhou have also risen from 3.8 yuan to 4.8 yuan. Yesterday, the Shanghai market rose by 20 cents, with Xuzhou groundnuts opening at 5.8 yuan, common Tancheng groundnuts at 5.9 to 6 yuan, and Kaifeng groundnuts at 6.3 to 6.4 yuan. Around 5 PM, it was reported from Xuzhou that the purchase price had reached 5 yuan, and the trend remained strong.</p>

<p>Rumors of Increased Taxes on White Slab Sugar</p>
<p>The Sugar Market Sees Either Price Increases or Caution</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the sugar market tightened due to rumors of changes in tariffs on white slab sugar. The guild set the price for 24 raw sugar white spot goods at 18.5 yuan, up by 10 cents. This factory's refined white sugar, because most of it uses white slab sugar as raw material, each factory is unwilling to redeem, except for the Siming factory that did not understand the details, redeemed more than a thousand bags alone. Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten, with the exchange rate slightly increasing and the tariff issue on white slab sugar remaining unresolved. The guild set the price for 24 raw sugar white spot goods at 18.55 yuan, with a little transaction, slightly increase by 5 cents from the day before, re-exported goods at 5.2 yuan, the increase is the same. The prices for 8 and 9 grade raw sugar increased by another 10 cents, with spot goods offered at 14 yuan and re-exported goods at 5 yuan, but there was little trading. This factory's refined white sugar had no sales because the tariffs are not determined. Market vendors in Guangdong had dozens of packages of Huizhou white, which was inferior, offered at 16.3 yuan. Merchants in Xinghua offered a batch of Xinghua raw sugar at 12.4 yuan. Merchants in Chaozhou, because the number of new Chaoqing arriving was not high, but the ground price rose, so the market was strong again. Yesterday, more than 400 packages arrived, and more than 300 packages have been offered, with the contract at 13 yuan, followed by 12.85 yuan, 8 yuan, 7 yuan, an increase of 34 cents from the previous market. Hueilai Qing cost 12.45 yuan.</p>

<p>Japanese Establish Tea Factory in Shanghai</p>
<p>After Japanese green tea was directly shipped to Morocco for sale last year by Japanese merchants, its quality was either superior or inferior. Without mixing it with Chinese tea, it was impossible to promote it. The Japanese merchants now know this situation, and in order to imitate the Chinese tea manufacturing method, they established a large-scale tea factory in Shanghai. It is said that a huge factory is being built on Tangshan Road, employing many tea workers from Jiangxi, specializing in the production of Zhenmei, Zhenmei and other patterns for the purpose of mixing with Japanese tea for export. According to observations by general tea merchants, if Japanese merchants manufacture and sell it properly in the future, Chinese tea will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics are Gradually Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Wuxi silk fabric manufacturers, due to white fabrics being promoted through export sales, are releasing next month's futures silk in Shanghai, amounting to a not-insignificant amount. In the blink of an eye, the end of the month for settlement is approaching, and the stored silk fabrics are being gradually shipped to Shanghai. In the last five days, a total of 280 pieces of white fabrics from Yuetu, Shuangying, Santiaowu, and Qixing brands have been loaded and are waiting to be settled.</p>

The wholesale price of genuine 4026 single-sided waterproof and beautiful raincoat fabric is 5.2 yuan per yard, with a slight increase of 10-20 cents for individual cuts. A currently sold raincoat costs an average of 21 yuan. The original Changlan gray silver checkered raincoat has become outdated in Shanghai, so those with old stock are selling them for only 13-14 yuan each. A double-sided gauze raincoat costs about 10 yuan each in stores.</p>

<p>Sichuan Merchants Procure Hardware</p>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has been greatly impacted by the financial emergency, and sales have been severely hampered. Factories no longer have the financial strength to absorb spot goods, and merchants are reducing purchases because their suppliers are unwilling to extend credit. As a result, the amount of transactions in the market has been greatly reduced. Only the Sichuan trade is thriving. The reason is that the remittance rate from Sichuan to Shanghai has suddenly decreased, and merchants in that area are profiting. In addition, with the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River not yet shallow, they are rushing to procure goods for winter sales. Therefore, the amount of transactions is much higher than that of other merchants. Although it rained continuously yesterday, there were still 3,000-4,000 dan of transactions. Among them, English steel plates, local factory yuan nails, new lead wire, galvanized iron sheet, tinplate, chess copper, and scissor mouth iron were the most popular. Angle iron, galvanized iron tiles, oil iron wire, and road leather were also reportedly popular. However, market prices have not changed much.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Realistic and Romantic <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Regardless of how literary historians divide literary trends into realism and romanticism, in literary practice, these two tendencies each have different artistic and social contents under different historical conditions, and they are often intertwined and cannot be mechanically separated. The creation of the same writer can contain both realistic and romantic elements. Even the most outstanding realistic writers sometimes inject elements of fantasy into reality, which is not uncommon in literary history.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare's plays, we see the appearance of Hamlet's father's ghost, terrible monsters patrolling the stage, and places where reality is exaggerated to a terrible extent. Balzac's "The Magic Skin" is said to provide a clearer understanding of French society at that time than any scientific research, but "The Magic Skin" is a Fantastic story. Gogol's masterpiece "The Overcoat" features ghosts stripping pedestrians of their overcoats at night. The protagonist of "The Nose" sees his lost nose riding in a carriage down the street, and even claims to be a fifth-rank civil servant. "Viy" is even a terrifying ghost story that makes your hair stand on end. However, this amazing combination of romantic fantasy and realistic depiction did not prevent these writers from being the greatest realists in literary history.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned distinction between realism and romanticism is unreliable. Dinamov, in an article on Shakespeare, pointed out the correct view of realism, which is worth our reference. Now let me quote Dinamov's words as follows:</p>
<p>"The evaluation of Shakespeare is not based on his external appearances of realism, but what is important is that Shakespeare did not look at reality from an idealist point of view. In his intention, in his content, and in the nature of his works, he is a realist. He utilized all kinds of literary and dramatic forms and genres, from comedy to tragedy, from tragedy to light stories, without ever treating objective reality as a simple reflection of the 'spirit'. His basis is fundamentally the surrounding world, ready-made rather than fabricated."</p>
<p>From this passage, we can see the standard of realism. If a writer's fundamental understanding of reality does not start from abstract subjective concepts but from reality and its own objective laws, then even if his works have places where reality is fantasized, they are still realistic works. On the contrary, romantic literature deals with reality with a thoroughly subjective, idealistic attitude. Fantasy, the desire for fantasy, is the source of romanticism. In the eyes of romanticists, fantasy is reality. Replacing gray reality with romantic fantasy is actually just an escape from reality. Romanticism as a trend is exactly this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Progressive literature should inherit the spirit of realism and stand firmly on reality, there is no doubt about this. However, at the same time, it must step over the boundaries of the old realism and regard romanticism as an inevitable aspect of its artistic creation. Here, romanticism is only a component part of realism, and not a trend that opposes realism. Romantic elements are present in true life. If we take a deep perspective on the positive side of life, we will surely find many heroic themes that are hard to believe.</p>
<p>The literature of old realism is non-heroic. It is characterized by a preference for the dark side of life. What it writes is all the ugliness, corruption, and hypocrisy of society. These writers cannot write "noble and beautiful things." The characters in their pens are mostly Philistines who do not have bright ideas and good deeds. Therefore, the more realistic their crops are, the more they show a gloomy and dim color, lacking the romantic and heroic atmosphere that can make people happy and inspired. This atmosphere is fully expressed in progressive realistic works. Because only progressive writers can delve into the positive aspects of life and find facts that are both moving and heroic.</p>
<p>"Realism is about accurately conveying typical characters in typical environments in addition to being detailed and authentic," this is a profound statement. Therefore, writers must have the ability to typify and generalize life phenomena. What they want to express is not life itself, but rather the truth about life. The typical thing is not modern, it can be picked up and obtained easily, but it is extracted and synthesized by the author from many things that are typical, essential, and common. Don Quixote or Hamlet do not really exist, but Shakespeare and Cervantes took the most typical qualities, habits, tastes, hopes, beliefs, grammar, etc. from many people and unified them in these two characters, so everyone feels that some of Don Quixote or Hamlet's elements are within their own blood. This kind of generalized typicality, even if it is exaggerated to a very romantic degree, still has artistic authenticity.</p>
<p>Artistic generalization is sometimes simply a "premonition." The author takes a secret, undeveloped, or embryonic fragment from reality, and points it out to people in an exaggerated form before they are aware of it, so the essence of that fragment is more typical and clearer. When "nihilism" had not yet become a major trend in Russian society, and Turgenev described a typical nihilistic character in "Fathers and Sons," contemporary critics regarded it as something that the author had imagined. They did not know that it was precisely the artistic generalization of reality.</p>
<p>Artistic generalization is not a simple representation of facts. Without creative imagination or fantasy, it is impossible to transform realistic materials into works of art. The kind of fantasy used by romanticists to escape reality and wander into ethereal realms cannot occupy a position in progressive realistic works, Needless to say. But fantasy itself is not a bad thing, and it can be said that people who cannot fantasize are stupid. Progressive writers must look at reality in the historical movement, find aspects with positive significance in the development of the times from reality, and express the future outline of those aspects. He must not only depict what already exists in reality, but also depict what may exist in reality. This relies on a rich imagination. However, such fantasy does not contradict the progress of reality, but can encourage people to strive to realize it. When literary works are permeated with this element of fantasy, they are likely to have romantic colors. And this kind of romanticism is rooted in reality and has the effect of illuminating and enriching reality.</p>
<p>To step over the boundaries of the surface of reality, delve into reality, synthesize reality, and achieve a true reflection of the essence of reality, this requires not only a correct worldview, but also a deep insight into reality and a great freedom of imagination.</p>

<p>— Dong Meng</p>
<p>When I was reading under the lamp, many mayflies flew around and collided. After several disturbances, they landed on the paper. By the next day, the bodies of these little things were lying in formation on the white paper, like irregularly inlaid patterns.</p>
<p>A friend said that mayflies are born in the morning and die in the evening. The lifespan of these little things is probably not very long. However, according to Emerson's mysterious lines of poetry, looking at a world in a grain of sand. Then their years of existence can also be said to be infinite. Although the universe is large, it is extremely small compared to other planets. Taking animals as an example, many dull and ignorant things, such as turtles and elephants, are also much older than humans. If we don't want to exaggerate ourselves? Then! The age of the earth is extremely short compared to many other planets. Comparing the two, one cannot help but feel discouraged and have a sense of living in the evening and dying.</p>
<p>However, human beings are ultimately spiritual things, and this is what makes them superior to all things. Mayflies are at most microorganisms. Look how small their form is! A Chinese poet has a wonderful metaphor: saying that mayflies shake big trees, it is often seen that they overestimate themselves. Among human beings, there is no such situation. Even if they fight each other, there are discords, struggles, or even cruel killings. But they always choose opponents that they can touch, and push, exclude, and trample on them; it can also be said to be shaking; but what is being shaken is their own kind. Moreover, they have already decided on their target before they even start.</p>
<h3 id="e220">People Who Drink Morning Tea <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Guang</p>
<p>Besides the family, in Sichuan, the teahouse is probably the only place where people can find solace. I have seen many people who have developed an addiction, an inseparable indulgence, to this place that slowly erodes a person's life and energy, much like an opium addiction.</p>
<p>As soon as they crawl out of their bedding, they don't even bother to button up their clothes. They throw on their garments, slip on their shoes, and, coughing all the way, head to the teahouse. Sometimes, they arrive so early that the tea stove has only just been lit. The reason for this early arrival is sometimes because they discovered a piece of news worth telling people during the night. As soon as they open their eyes, they feel they cannot hold it in. Other times, it is simply because they heard an unusual noise from the street or a neighbor's house late at night while in bed, and they want to find out what happened to satisfy their curiosity.</p>
<p>However, even if it is not for these reasons, but because their habits have gone awry, this will not discourage them. They can sit in their usual spot in the dimness of dawn and doze off for a while. Or, they can try to glean some unexpected stories that they missed from the server's mouth with a few simple, vague questions.</p>
<p>"So late... Did you sleep late?"</p>
<p>"Strange things happened again in Water Alley," the server explains. "They just left that pile of junk on the doorstep..."</p>
<p>"Heh, I heard the giggling there," the customer laughs in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Of course, if the server curtly replies, "It's still early," they will quickly drift back to sleep until the pitiable person who wakes up before the night watchman falls asleep calls out, "The tea is ready!" Then, they will respond from their throats, "Humph," or nod slightly. However, even if they are silent, once the server calls out, their duty is fulfilled, and they each go about their work.</p>
<p>When they realize that the tea is ready, they always first use two fingers to dab a little on the corners of their eyes. Then, along the edge of the bowl, they blow a long breath to clear away the charred tea stems and broken leaves floating on the surface. They then drink down most of the bowl in one gulp. Then, puffing on their fire pipe, they cough and wheeze, forming something like a question mark. Only when other customers sit down in the teahouse does the first person to arrive at the teahouse appear to be alive. They perk up and, in a slow tone, report the story told by the server, interspersed with sighs and comments.</p>
<p>"It's still that bad thing that's no good, hitting and acting crazy when it sees people."</p>
<p>"If the bitch doesn't wag its tail, the dog won't get on its back!" another person echoes.</p>
<p>When this kind of talk can be brought to a close, the reporter yawns, rubs his eyelids, and mutters to the tea stove, "I haven't washed my face yet." So, the server drags a stool and places it in a convenient spot near the family seating area and brings over some water for washing. This way, it is not necessary to change the squatting position in order to wash one's face. One only needs to turn slightly to the side and stretch out both hands. However, if one has not yet participated in the conversations of other tea drinkers, washing one's face can take a very long time.</p>
<p>"You are not wronging him at all with your words. What I saw was even uglier. For example..." The washcloth, just raised by the fingers, falls back into the washbasin.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the server has to change the water in the washbasin before they can complete this very difficult task. Then, while slipping on their shoes and buttoning their buttons, they stroll over to the rice wine vendor across the street, bending over to examine the items on the carrying pole, and then, pointing their finger, they carefully instruct, word by word:</p>
<p>"Listen clearly? - Add an egg. A fresh one. Good, this one will do. You look at it for me..."</p>
<p>When the small vegetable vendors start calling out their wares along the chilling street market, they always buy some bean sprouts as usual, pile them on the tea table, and pick off the roots one by one, as finely as if they were embroidering. From their expressions, this is also a gesture close to extravagance. Once the vegetables are picked clean, the children at home will come and take them back, without them having to move a step; they only need to give the same old instructions:</p>
<p>"Don't talk about it, - add a little more vinegar, stir-fry it a little raw, got it!"</p>
<p>At breakfast time, they do not go home until the people at home have urged them three or five times. They slowly take the tea bowl to the middle of the tea table, ask the server to take care of it, and say they will come back after eating. All the while, they talk to the tea drinkers reluctantly, as if they are very unwilling to leave.</p>
<p>"And then what?"</p>
<p>"And then what, it wasn't admitting that he was wrong."</p>
<p>"I told you long ago, let him eat a little chili; I feel refreshed... "</p>
<p>By this time, the entire morning has been spent. But they don't feel sorry at all. In fact, they didn't even think about it. Once their stomachs are full, there is still a lot of time waiting for them, wasted like a wealthy person using their wealth.</p>
<p>Here, I only hope that the current unrest will not disturb them.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Tomorrow (1) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— (Written by Joseph Conrad) Translated by Wu Xiangyu</p>
<p>Captain Hagberd was not a popular character in the port of Colebrook. He wasn't from around here. The reasons he used to live here weren't too mysterious - he told them to people openly - but those reasons were ridiculously unbelievable. He obviously had some money, because he had bought a piece of land and built two very cheap, unsightly yellow brick houses. He lived in one himself and rented the other to Joshua, Javvil - blind Javvil, a shipbuilder - who had a bad reputation as a domestic tyrant.</p>
<p>The two houses shared a wall, and the small front gardens were separated by iron fences; the small back patios were separated by wooden fences. Besson, Miss Javvil, seemed to have a designated right to dry her tablecloth, blue rags, or a skirt in the middle.</p>
<p>'That'll rot the wood, Besson, my girl,' the captain said gently from his side of the wooden fence, every time he saw her exercising that prerogative.</p>
<p>She was a tall woman; the wooden fence was low, and she could rest her elbows on top of it. Her hands must have been red after she'd washed some clothes, but her forearms were white and beautiful. She always silently looked at her father's landlord - this meaningful silence was accompanied by an attitude of cordial anticipation.</p>
<p>'That'll rot the wood,' Captain Hagberd repeated. 'For you, I know this is just a careless, unintentional habit. Why don't you hang a rope in the back patio?'</p>
<p>Miss Javvil didn't say anything about this either - she just passively shook her head. In her back patio on one side, there was a bed of black soil, surrounded by stones, in which she grew a few flowers in her spare time, which looked very prosperous, like leisurely foreign ones; and on the other side of the wooden fence, wild flowers grew knee-high, and Captain Hagberd only showed a straight, healthy body, wrapped in a number one head-to-toe canvas suit. Using this color, this coarse, special material that he chose to make clothes, people looked at him - this was a silent marker of his current observation - just like a petrified man turned to bluestone standing upright in a wasteland not big enough for a good billiard room. In short, he was a huge stone man, with a red and beautiful face, a blue and lifeless eye, and a beard that drooped to his chest, which the people of Colebrook had never seen him cut or shave.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Colebrook's famous comedian, the barber, happened to be proudly sitting in the saloon of the "New Hotel" on the seafront one day when the captain also went there to buy an ounce of tobacco. The barber playfully asked him when he could do his business. The captain replied very seriously, "I think, next month". After Captain Hagberd took out a halfpenny from the handkerchief tucked into his cuff to pay, he walked out. As soon as the door closed, the barber laughed. 'This old guy and a young man are about to walk into my shop hand in hand for a haircut. The tailor will soon have business, the barber will have business, and the candle shop will soon have business; good times are coming to Colebrook, they're coming, definitely. He used to answer "next week", but now he says "next month", maybe soon, I think, he'll say "next spring".'</p>

<h3 id="e222">Great Assembly for World Peace Prayer <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>In this world where gunpowder depots are scattered and the smell of gunpowder permeates, it is time for compassionate people and diplomats who "cherish peace" to take the lead. For example, the peace prayer meeting held by the Roman Pope not long ago, and the peace prayer meetings held by General Superintendent Cai Ning in Peiping and other places after he came to China, all caused a sensation and spread far and wide. As for French Foreign Minister Barthou, who sacrificed his life in the Marseilles tragedy and worked harder for "peace", and former British Foreign Minister Henderson, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in "disarmament", they are all outstanding figures.</p>
<p>However, in this wave of economic panic, the world's great powers are competing to find markets and joining forces to divide colonies. China, with its "vast land and abundant resources", has long become the main target of plunder by various imperialisms. No matter who wins or loses the war, China will be sacrificed. The trampling during the war and the slaughter after the war will all benefit the remaining land and 400 million people of China. Thinking of the trampling and fate that the descendants of the Yellow Emperor are bound to encounter, it is truly "chilling to the bone". Our opposition to war and support for peace is not to save some "human catastrophe" with "humanitarianism", but to take our own liberation as a practical benefit. The main purpose is here.</p>
<p>However, the inevitable trend of imperialism is to use war to solve the problem of "redistributing the world". This is the inevitable conclusion under the current social organization. Asking them not to go to war by means of "peace prayer" is no different from advising Zhang Xianzhong not to kill people. Asking them not to plunder colonies is like persuading a cat not to bite mice. If we, who have been regarded as "meat on the chopping board", want to find a way to national independence and liberation from "peace prayer", it is purely like a prisoner who has been sentenced to death, hoping for salvation from God to comfort ourselves.</p>
<p>Naturally, the "Great Assembly for Peace Prayer" has become a manifestation of this "progress". However, true peace, I am afraid, cannot be solved simply by the four characters of "peace prayer".</p>

<p>— Lu Yin Quan</p>
<p>Autumn is ethereal, like a wisp of ethereal light cloud, flickering in the deep silver sea of the dark west sky, quietly rippling in, and now quietly rippling away again. In just a moment, perhaps we will not be able to see the remnants of autumn. When autumn comes, I don't have any special feeling. It's a bit strange to say, sometimes I don't even feel the existence of autumn. But now that it is about to disappear, I am somewhat reluctant. Even though I know that the emotion of reluctance will never be able to hold back the passage of time, my stubborn heart still insists on doing so; people, how foolish they are.</p>
<p>Others say that autumn is hidden in the scarlet maple leaves</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>in the sharp claws of fat crabs, but I, perhaps you won't even believe it, realize the existence of autumn from the cry of a night-blooming jasmine flower girl outside the window, and at the same time, I feel the fall of late autumn in this cry. This wisp of sorrowful light sound is indeed full of the gloom of autumn. No, it's not just a little gloom, it's simply the whole of autumn.</p>
<p>Every day is like this, when I return from outside, reading some newly arrived magazines by the window, or picking up a pen to write, a rather haggard cry, from downstairs, like the breath of deep autumn, lightly floats over:</p>
<p>--Selling night-blooming jasmine!</p>
<p>This short cry, even without musical rhythm, bursts out with such a large amount of sorrow as autumn from this cry. My originally very tranquil heart is now inevitably depressed by this sound. Even if the cry has floated away, even if I can't hear it anymore, a lead-like blockage still presses on my heart, I don't know when this blockage will dissolve?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new autumn, the flower girl's cry for sale seems to be louder, but now it seems to be gradually withering as autumn grows old. I really don't understand how such a haggard sound can escape from the lips of a beautiful young girl? Does she not have youth? Youth, disappeared in the weaving of the lifeline.</p>
<p>For a little pity and sympathy, I always listen to this mournful voice every day, adding some light sorrow to the quiet stream of life, it is also needed.</p>
<p>The deeper autumn is, the weaker her voice becomes. But today, how is it that I can't hear this cry? Is she not coming to sell night-blooming jasmine? I think, perhaps she disappeared along with the late autumn.</p>
<p>And a lead block still presses on my heart, even if a faint sorrow ripples on the corner of the building.</p>
<h3 id="e224">In the Park <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Han</p>
<p>Occasionally happy, I wanted to go to the park to bask in the sun. - Living in a house without sun, I am yearning for the sun as if I have fallen in love.</p>
<p>The park is already full of autumn colors: chrysanthemums can be seen everywhere. There are chrysanthemums on the slope, chrysanthemums by the road, and chrysanthemums in the center of the lawn. Although I didn't come to admire the chrysanthemums, I still have to glance at them a few times to appreciate whether the yellow ones are better or the white ones are better. At the same time, I ran to the wall of the large lawn while admiring the chrysanthemums to find a chair to sit and bask in the sun.</p>
<p>There are many Jiangbei mothers there taking care of foreign children playing. Some of them are knitting sweaters in their hands, leisurely. I finally found a chair and sat down, pretending to doze off while basking in the sun. Two mothers were chatting in a rustling voice, telling a love story. They thought I was asleep.</p>
<p>One of them, who was older, said, "He likes you." The other, who was younger, immediately replied with half embarrassment and half anger, "There is no such thing." The older one brought up the time and place to prove her words. She said, "Wasn't he talking to you very well by the back door yesterday?" The younger one was silent. I opened half an eye to glance at her. The blush on her face spread from her cheeks to the roots of her ears. I wanted to hear more, but the foreign children they were taking care of ran away while playing. They shouted loudly, "Oscar, Mary!" The conversation also stopped.</p>
<p>A French child rode a tricycle to my side and stopped, bumping my foot. He laughed loudly. I opened my eyes and looked at him. The child stared at me for a long time. I called out to exercise. He misunderstood what I meant, and for some reason, he started doing somersaults on the grass. His mother shouted at him from afar and ran over to pull his little hand away.</p>
<p>A group of Russian children surrounded me. I had met them a few days ago. They wanted me to get up and lead them in learning soldier gymnastics. The children are really naughty. I refused, so they all climbed on me and touched my beard. Moreover, some of them were behind me, pulling down the chair I was sitting on, causing me to fall down. There is really no way to deal with children! So, I stood up and gave orders according to their wishes.</p>
<p>The older ones in front and the younger ones in the back, they had already lined up, but one of the younger ones insisted on standing in front, and the older one refused. They argued and made a mess, rolling on the ground. It was hard to get them into formation, and when I told them to start walking, they ran away after only a few steps. If you run away, I can sit back in the chair and bask in the sun. I don't care, so I sat in the chair and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>However, they didn't just run away, but gathered together again, and seeing that I was ignoring them, they ran back to me again. This is really annoying. I suggested telling them a story, and they agreed. And very innocently and warmly, they stared at me with their little eyes, listening to a story about gods and monsters.</p>
<p>I thought of my younger siblings at home. My younger siblings at home often surrounded me and listened to me tell stories. However, after a life of wandering, I can't go home! After leaving the park, homesickness has been constant.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Cartoon on the Train <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>The train rumbled along the tracks in the dark night. The third-class carriage was crowded with all kinds of people, making noise in various dialects, which made people panic. However, after the train had been running for an hour, under the attack of fatigue, the scene of unrestrained lying down, regardless of men or women, was truly a spectacle.</p>
<p>A female student with short hair, a white cloth shirt, and a black skirt walked into the carriage with a quilt and a box. She put the quilt in the overhead rack, and then lay down with the box as a pillow. At first, she was bending her feet, but later she stretched her feet straight and put them on the leg of a strange man; she was sleeping soundly and loudly; and the man was also sleeping sweetly as if nothing had happened, sometimes even putting one foot on the woman's thigh. Such a pair of strange men and women sleeping with their feet crossed does not mean that they do not know propriety, justice, and shame, but in the environment of this third-class seat, in the face of unbearable fatigue, they naturally do it. From this, one is reminded that those tricks of prohibiting men and women from traveling and eating together are just materials for after-dinner conversations!</p>
<p>Because everyone was lying down, it was as if this third-class carriage was like a mass burial ground. The fat man sitting blankly was like a grave keeper. The fat man was from the north, with a fat face, squinting eyes, and a mustache, looking like the Panchen Lama who once set up an altar in Hangzhou to pray for rain. He was always smiling, looking at the prostrate masses, silently smoking his pipe. Until the train entered the platform, the fat man never slept. This was not because he didn't want to sleep, but because all the seats were occupied. Therefore, he had no choice but to sit. That spirit of courtesy fully represents the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Speaking of the spirit of the Chinese people, this is also a masterpiece. That was when the train passed F station, and a few more people were added to the third-class carriage. Among them was a middle-aged man dressed in a long gown and mandarin jacket, who looked very gentlemanly. When he saw this scene like a mass burial ground, he shook his head and sighed: "What does this look like!" However, after a while, this middle-aged gentleman seemed to forget what he had just said, and stuffed himself into the mass burial ground and snored loudly; what does this look like? However, this courage is really admirable!</p>
<p>A figure who looked like a wandering hustler, with greasy hair, actually managed to pick up a middle-aged woman when the people in the car were only busy sleeping and didn't pay attention to him. They were originally sitting in the middle, but later quietly moved to that corner. Although there were a few soldiers guarding the car in that corner, they were all sound asleep, allowing the two people who had just met to negotiate the procedures for their progress.</p>
<p>Although the toilets were marked for men and women, the people in this third-class carriage seemed to care whether it was men or women, as long as it was a toilet. Once, a man walked into the women's toilet and closed the door, and a woman was waiting outside. Waiting, waiting, and still not seeing the man finish his business and come out, so she walked into the men's toilet. There was also a farce in which an old man and a woman were fighting to enter the women's toilet, which was staged in this third-class carriage.</p>
<p>When the train pulled into Shanghai North Station, it was already dawn. This third-class carriage became as noisy as when the train had just started. The middle-aged gentleman who "what does this look like" walked off the train with sleepy eyes. The female student with the white cloth shirt and black skirt walked away as if nothing had happened to her sleeping with her feet crossed with a strange man. The fat northerner who looked like the Panchen Lama was still smiling with squinting eyes. The people who were fighting for the toilet also dispersed. Only the greasy-haired man took the picked-up middle-aged woman away together. Everything, everything in this third-class carriage is changing like a "grand hotel", because it is also a microcosm of society!</p>
<h3 id="e227">On "Climbing the Dragon Gate" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Dan Ran</p>
<p>Those preparing to embark on the path of literature almost all hope to "climb the dragon gate." Indeed, "climbing the dragon gate" is a crucial step in gaining status. Without "climbing the dragon gate," one cannot hear others call you a "literary writer." To walk the path of literature, one naturally wants to achieve "fame," and to achieve "fame," one must naturally think of "climbing the dragon gate." There is no need to oppose this. However, here I want to give a "wake-up call."</p>
<p>Recently, at a friend's house, I happened to come across a clipping from the Nanjing Chao Bao supplement, where I saw an article discussing "Zhang Kebiao's Job Advertisement." "Zhang Kebiao's Job Advertisement" was published in the classified ads of the Shen Bao, which I had not seen before. To avoid copying someone else's article, I excerpt the main points: "For several years, I have made a living by writing, claiming to be a freelance professional, but in reality, I am a dignified beggar. Now, for the sake of living, I seek a job."</p>
<p>Zhang Kebiao originally contributed the secret "Techniques for Climbing the Dragon Gate in the Literary World" to the general public. His "techniques for climbing the dragon gate" are certainly not bad. However, he is now "seeking a job for the sake of living."</p>
<p>From this, we can derive two answers:</p>
<p>First, although "climbing the dragon gate" seems to have certain boundaries, it ultimately has no real territory. Has Zhang Kebiao already "climbed the dragon gate"? If we say he "has not," then we can understand the difficulty of "climbing the dragon gate." If the author of the secret "Techniques for Climbing the Dragon Gate in the Literary World" cannot achieve the goal of "climbing the dragon gate," then those who have just embarked on the path of literature should "retreat in the face of difficulty"!</p>
<p>Second, from the fact that many people are familiar with the three characters "Zhang Kebiao," we can naturally say: "Zhang Kebiao has climbed the dragon gate." However, even someone who has already "climbed the dragon gate" still needs to "seek a job for the sake of living." Then, the value of "climbing the dragon gate" is very questionable. If "climbing the dragon gate" cannot solve one's own livelihood and one still needs a job, then 'those who yearn for "climbing the dragon gate" must prepare "supplies" early,' and this sentence must be printed on the cover when the "Techniques for Climbing the Dragon Gate in the Literary World" is reprinted to prevent people from following in Zhang Kebiao's footsteps.</p>
<p>I heard that in foreign countries, a writer does not have to worry about livelihood. If a decent work is published, one can eat and drink endlessly for life. But that is, after all, a foreign country. God destined you to be born in eastern Asia, so what can you do?</p>
<p>Finally, I want to erect a road sign, borrowing Sun Xizhen's words from "Me and Literature" to write on it: "This path cannot provide a secure livelihood."</p>
<p>In addition, I must declare: This article of mine is originally a discussion of the matter at hand, and I believe it is 'an expression of deep emotion.' I have no intention of disrespecting Mr. Zhang. Please forgive me, Mr. Zhang.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Lending Money to Someone to Bet on Dog Racing? <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>You are the guide on the path of the lost, capable of providing considerable solutions and clarity for those who encounter difficult problems. I admire you very much. I now also have a question that I venture to ask, hoping you will publish it in the next few days when you have time. I would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I was an apprentice in a shop. There was a clerk, Mr. A, who was very close to me, but he had a bad habit. He could be said to never miss a dog race. Therefore, he gradually borrowed more than one hundred yuan from me. His purpose was mostly for this place. Among these funds, besides my family's money, there was also money entrusted to me by others for delivery, which he borrowed. When he borrowed the money, he always said that he could settle it soon and used sweet talk or invited me to go to the movies, etc. How could a young person like me resist such coaxing?</p>
<p>But now, because of pressure from others and my own financial difficulties, I have repeatedly asked him to return the money, but he ignores it as if nothing happened. Alas, what method can I use to ask him for the money? It is truly extremely difficult. Please, sir, provide a solution! Respectfully wishing you</p>
<p>Peace, Song Long</p>
<p>Editor's Note: When lending money to someone, there is a prerequisite: what will the person do with the money? If they are using it for a legitimate purpose, then we should help them and lend it to them. But if they are using it for an improper purpose, then we should refuse, because if you lend them money to do bad things, you become an accomplice to evil. Like Mr. Song's friend, who borrowed money to bet on dog racing, dog racing is a form of gambling and a very bad habit. Then, you should not lend him money. However, Mr. Song, because of his sweet talk and the temptation of movies, etc., not only lent him his own money, but also allowed him to swindle away other people's money to lose. This is Mr. Song's first mistake.</p>
<p>Also, there are two types of loans: one is a moral loan. This type of loan requires a deep friendship between the two parties, and the question of whether it will be repaid in the future is not discussed. Furthermore, the borrower's usual credit is also very good, so there is no need to write a loan agreement. The second type is a secured loan. This type of loan must have adequate collateral in advance, and a written agreement must be made, stating the repayment date, as proof for the future. Mr. Song's loan certainly cannot be considered a moral loan, but Mr. Song did not ask his friend to write a loan agreement, which is a big mistake. Because there is no written agreement, and according to the letter, it seems that there was no third party involved, then he can deny everything without regard for conscience. At that time, he is not legally responsible.</p>
<p>The only way to remedy the situation now is to quickly have him write you a loan agreement, preferably with someone as a witness. With a loan agreement, you should immediately ask him for the money and not delay any further.</p>
<p>Finally, the editor wants to declare that the purpose of publishing this letter is not to find a way for Mr. Song to recover the money, but to advise readers on some opinions about lending money to others, hoping everyone will pay attention to this point.</p>

<p>Topic: Stone Drum Song</p>
<p>Zhang Sheng holds the stone drum inscriptions in his hand,</p>
<p>And urges me to try to compose a Stone Drum Song.</p>
<p>Du Fu and Li Bai are no more,</p>
<p>With my meager talent, how can I cope with the Stone Drums?</p>
<p>The Zhou dynasty declined, and the world was in turmoil,</p>
<p>King Xuan rose in anger and wielded the heavenly halberd.</p>
<p>He opened the Mingtang wide to receive courtly homage,</p>
<p>And the swords and jade pendants of the dukes clanged as they rubbed against each other.</p>
<p>He hunted in Qishan, displaying his heroic prowess,</p>
<p>And the beasts of the field for ten thousand li were all swept into the net.</p>
<p>He carved the merits and achievements to proclaim to all generations,</p>
<p>Chiseling stones to make drums, demolishing towering heights.</p>
<p>The attending officials were all masters of talent and art,</p>
<p>Carefully selected to compose and carve, leaving a record on the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Rain and sun drenched, wild fires blazed,</p>
<p>Ghosts and spirits guarded it, needing constant protection.</p>
<p>From where did you obtain the paper copy?</p>
<p>Every detail is complete, without any errors.</p>
<p>The words are stern, the meaning dense, difficult to understand,</p>
<p>The script is unlike either the clerical script or the tadpole script.</p>
<p>After many years, how can it avoid missing strokes?</p>
<p>A quick sword can cut through and create dragons and mythical beasts.</p>
<p>Phoenixes soared and phoenixes danced, many immortals descended,</p>
<p>Coral and jade trees intertwined their branches.</p>
<p>Golden ropes and iron chains locked the buttons tightly,</p>
<p>Ancient tripods leaped in the water, dragons soared like shuttles.</p>
<p>Vulgar scholars cannot enter with their poetry,</p>
<p>The two elegant collections are cramped and without free-flowing style.</p>
<p>Confucius traveled west but did not reach Qin,</p>
<p>Holding a parasol, neglecting the stars, leaving behind righteous daughters.</p>
<p>Alas, I love antiquity but was born too late,</p>
<p>Facing this, tears flowed in torrents.</p>
<p>I remember when I was first summoned by the Imperial Academy,</p>
<p>That year, the era name was changed to Yuanhe.</p>
<p>An old friend serving in the right garrison,</p>
<p>Measured and excavated the old inscriptions for me.</p>
<p>I washed my crown and bathed, reporting to the Director of the Imperial Academy,</p>
<p>Such treasures, how many still exist?</p>
<p>They can be easily transported in felt bags and reed mats,</p>
<p>Ten drums only require a few camels.</p>
<p>Presented in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, comparable to ancient tripods,</p>
<p>Their value is more than a hundred times greater.</p>
<p>If the sacred grace allows them to remain in the Imperial Academy,</p>
<p>The students can discuss and learn together.</p>
<p>Viewing the classics, Hongdu is still choked with sobs,</p>
<p>Sitting and watching the whole country come running.</p>
<p>Chip away at the moss, scrape away the dirt, revealing the angles,</p>
<p>Place them properly, level and not tilted.</p>
<p>Build deep eaves and wide roofs to cover them,</p>
<p>Through long ages, hoping to remain without error.</p>
<p>High officials in the central court are old and experienced,</p>
<p>How can they be grateful or timid and hesitant?</p>
<p>Shepherds strike fire, oxen sharpen their horns,</p>
<p>Who will again take the hand to rub and polish?</p>
<p>Day by day, month by month, they will wear away and become buried,</p>
<p>For six years, gazing west, I empty sing.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Movies of "Semi-Colonies" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ping</p>
<p>"China is a semi-colony," many people say. Leaving aside politics, diplomacy, economics, and military affairs, these major national issues, let's just talk about Chinese movies, which also concretely reflect the characteristics of a semi-colony.</p>
<p>In the past, movies made by foreign overlords were always accepted by China unconditionally. Recently, foreign films have also been subject to censorship, but the supernatural and sensual films that Chinese people cannot make can be imported and publicly screened by foreign overlords. Movies that insulted China are no longer shown in China, but "The Good Earth," "The Oil Lamp," and other films that have some suspicion of insulting China can find Chinese people to act in them in mainland China.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign films, Chinese people have almost no right to choose. Hollywood can take movies to China after they are made, regardless of whether Chinese audiences understand the dialogue in the play. In other countries, the import and screening of foreign films is not so simple. American films going to France must be re-shot with French dialogue or have French subtitles added. French films going to Germany must be re-shot with German dialogue or have German subtitles added. Even in Japan, foreign films must have Japanese subtitles added. RKO's films even have to have Japanese actors re-shoot copies with Japanese dialogue in Tokyo! Chinese audiences are probably geniuses of language, and must understand English films, French films, German films, and Russian films. If they don't understand, foreign film merchants don't care, you can still go to the movie theater to practice foreign languages.</p>
<p>We have domestic movies, and our film companies can make movies themselves, which is of course very glorious. However, making movies must adhere to a certain scope and not overstep one's bounds. For example, scenes that harm the face of foreign overlords should not be filmed, so as not to harm diplomatic relations, which is understandable (whether movies that insult China harm diplomatic relations need not be discussed here). Things where foreign countries bully China and foreign overlords act domineeringly should also not be filmed, but this is for what? It is inevitable that people will be puzzled. As for the same event, the other country desperately films it to scold us, but we cannot even film newsreels that record the truth of the facts, and even if we film them, we cannot publicly screen them, which is even more incomprehensible. Therefore, movies of the Volunteer Army cannot be filmed, movies of the Battle of Shanghai are not good to film, the September 18th Incident is not good to film, and historical films of China being invaded cannot be filmed. A movie with allegorical nature like "Evil Neighbor" is not allowed to be made in the concessions, and "Sacrifice for the Country" must also be banned. Even a movie like "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours," a sketch of life, is still far from being publicly screened because it involves a little patrol in the concessions. Recently, the situation has become even more severe. Subtitles such as "September 18th," "January 28th," and "Northeast" are not good to use, and maps of the four northeastern provinces should not be on the screen. The Chinese film industry is really too pitiful.</p>
<p>Foreign capital has invaded all aspects of Chinese business, and only the cultural business sector—no, strictly speaking, only the book industry and the film industry are still under the control of Chinese capital. However, according to recent newspaper reports, a Sino-foreign joint venture film company will appear in Shanghai. Originally, in foreign countries, there are also foreign capital-operated film businesses. Several major Hollywood companies have photography studios in England, Germany, and France, but the situation is different. If China has a Sino-foreign joint venture film company, not only will several domestic film companies have to close down, but even China's film business, no, even China's culture, will be under the control of foreign capital. Fortunately, it is still just a rumor now, and maybe it will not become a reality. Let's wait and see.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e236">Review of "The Black Cat" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Stone Ax</p>
<p>"The Black Cat" at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>Since "eerie and terrifying," "ghastly," plus "clever mechanisms" and other similar films have been welcomed by some people, it has created opportunities for two people, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. The former's makeup art, in addition to being "pleasing to the eye," has not had a peerless master like Lon Chaney before, and Karloff has certainly not yet discovered a similar "follower." The latter is known as "Big Bad Bela" in Hollywood, and of course he must have his own special advantages in portraying villains.</p>
<p>But in this "Black Cat," although it has "both beauties" and "two difficulties," it gives us nothing more than some tragic screams and some murderous art, and there are no other benefits. Furthermore, one may doubt whether there are still the murderous rituals of religions as described in Haggard's novels in such a world.</p>
<p>In order to protect the reason for "killing people," the script had to come up with some sacrificial patterns, so that many horror scenes could be created. Originally, horror films could not get rid of these clichés, but the layout of this film is too unevolved. Because it tried hard to increase the power of strangeness and desolation, it made people unable to "get goosebumps" after watching it.</p>
<p>Regarding the plot as mentioned above, then it is nothing more than seeing what strange things these two weirdos are doing again. Karloff has his own old routine, and Bela does not see any special features. The movements when the two fight are so clumsy that they don't look like real fights. The scenery is very useful in some new-style architectural patterns and three-dimensionality. We can't imagine that we can learn about decoration in watching mystery films.</p>
<p>Originally, Hollywood's producers were "clearly divided." Warner is known for its social short plays and classics, MGM is known for its modern realistic films, Columbia is a master of musical dance films, and United Artists is known for its artistic and literary films. Among the others, Universal's "superficial" and "large but inappropriate" films are the most. It is said that this film sold very well, so I think of when swordsmen novels were popular, there were indeed people who went to "abandon their homes and seek the Tao" and "fly" out of the window and fall to their deaths.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e237">My View on "Grievance of a Lady" <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Nick</p>
<p>This is a play adapted from a literary work, so it must be discussed from another perspective.</p>
<p>Generally, films adapted from non-literary works succeed in another style through the compilation of plots and the depiction of characters. The former includes novels by Xiao E, Alexandre Dumas père, and Alexandre Dumas fils. The latter includes novels by Dickens, and also a film such as "Little Women." The former is naturally easier to render dynamically into movies, while the latter, even if it is edited to the best degree, is only about watching the expressions and actions of the actors. If it can be performed with "generosity and agitation," or "gentle tenderness," to the point where people have a feeling of "laughing and crying," it can also be said to be a very good result.</p>
<p>If we go to see a play whose script is adapted from a certain book or story or novel that we have always known, then we have a preconceived notion and hope before we watch it. Then, this type of play, although it can be a sensation for a while, is that preconceived notions differ from person to person, and the degree of satisfaction of hope cannot be consistent, so in terms of appreciation, it is discounted.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this "Grievance of a Lady" is only some skills in character depiction. From Norma Shearer to Maureen O'Sullivan, it has great success in trying to figure out the actions and personality of the people at that time, and they are all quite hardworking.</p>
<p>There is a roughly similar style to "Little Women" here, but "Little Women" is full of a "harmonious and auspicious" tone, while here it is everywhere "solemn" and "desolate." However, audiences who "do not seek deep understanding" and seek amusement may not be satisfied with this film.</p>
<h3 id="e238">"Mrs. Mai" to be Released <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Fire</p>
<p>"Mrs. Mai," directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Hu Die and the famous dance troupe Liang sisters, is an all-dialogue and song sound film. It features a wavy story and stimulating descriptions, as well as interesting Cantonese opera excerpts: including "The Amorous History of Xuan Palace" performed by Xie Xingnong and Chen Jintang, "Ice Mountain Fire Line" and "The Heavenly Maiden Delivers a Son" performed by Zeng Sanduo, Xie Xingnong, and Feng Xiaofei, and "Who Will the Imperial Daughter Marry," Hu Die's first appearance on screen with Gua Ge Yang. The entire film is full of a soft Southern flavor and overflows with a wonderful romantic atmosphere. The actor worth mentioning is the Cantonese young man Hu Yixing. He is a basic actor of the Mingxing Film Company. Although he has not yet become famous on the screen, his handsome and refreshing expression here clearly shows that his future is limitless. The Liang sisters, Saizhu and Saisan, this pair of charming Southern beauties, also appear in this film. Although it's their first time on camera, their performance is surprisingly successful. The film will be released soon at the Xinguang Grand Theater. (Que)</p>

<h3 id="e243">Flying Flower Village (1) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Shi</p>
<p>Produced by Yihua Company, directed by Zheng Yingshi, starring Gao Zhanfei, Hu Ping, etc.</p>
<p>The spring breeze brings a warm breath to the world, and the scenery of Flying Flower Village is particularly charming. In the east of the village, there are several low houses in the shadows of flowers and green water, which are the flower garden and home of Ah Hua (played by Gao Zhanfei), who works as a cook on the train. In addition to going to work on the train every day, the planting, picking, and selling of flowers at home are handled by his old father (played by Qin Tong), who lost a left leg, and his young daughter Xiao Hua (played by Chen Juanjuan), and Xiao Hua's mother (Hu Ping) who work together.</p>
<p>Ah Hua's personality is very stubborn. When the stationmaster (played by Wang Naidong) gives him a lot of money and asks him to help smuggle private goods, he firmly refuses. The stationmaster believes that his refusal to go along with him has become an obstacle to their secret work, so he develops the determination to dismiss Ah Hua on the pretext of an excuse.</p>
<p>The wages that Ah Hua earns each month are very limited and are not enough to support his family. Fortunately, they can sell some flowers every day to supplement their household expenses. However, recently, due to the impact of the urban recession, the sales of flowers have also been affected, and they cannot even sell a single flower in a day.</p>
<p>One morning, Xiao Hua's mother, as usual, carried a basket of fresh flowers just picked from the garden to the flower market to sell, but unfortunately, she did not sell the flowers again. She anxiously wandered near the Flying Flower Village station and happened to be seen by the stationmaster. When he saw her beautiful demeanor, he couldn't help but be moved. So, the next day, when Ah Hua was not at home, he went to her house, but because Ah Hua's father was at home, he did not dare to make any presumptuous moves, only winked at her, gave Xiao Hua a silver dollar, and left.</p>
<p>It was a terrifying night of wind, rain, thunderstorms, and lightning. Ah Hua's father's old illness suddenly worsened. From his short breaths and the upward blinking of his eyes, it was clear that he was about to leave this world. When Xiao Hua's mother saw this terrifying scene, she hurriedly braved the rain and ran to the station in the dark to ask the stationmaster to allow Ah Hua to return immediately, but Ah Hua had been transferred by the main station to another section to drive a military train, and would not be back for four or five days.</p>
<p>When Xiao Hua's mother received this news, tears streamed down her face like a broken string. The clever stationmaster saw that the opportunity had arrived: he also generously took out a stack of banknotes from his pocket and gave them to her: "This is a small matter, I'll lend you some money first." Xiao Hua's mother gratefully took the money and ran back like lightning. However, the old grandfather had not waited for her return and had closed his eyes and passed away!</p>
<p>A few days later, Ah Hua returned. When he stepped into the house and saw his father's memorial tablet, he wailed and cried so much that he almost fainted. When Xiao Niang told him that the funeral expenses were lent by the stationmaster, Ah Hua couldn't help but burst into anger: he blamed Xiao Hua's mother for not borrowing money from such a bad person.</p>
<p>Ah Hua's father's death naturally gave the stationmaster great convenience. When Ah Hua was not at home, the stationmaster secretly ran over, and each time he brought many things to give to her. Xiao Hua's mother's will was shaken by the stationmaster's material and dedicated double temptation. Finally, one morning, she was anesthetized by the stationmaster's sweet words and, while Xiao Hua was fast asleep, followed the stationmaster to Shanghai. When they arrived in Shanghai, they traveled around many lively places and bought many fashionable clothes.</p>
<p>In the evening, the stationmaster coaxed her to a hotel, got her drunk, and achieved his goal of trampling on women. (To be continued)</p>
