<p>時評</p>
<h3>救濟東北失學靑年　愼</h3>
<p>兩年以來東北四省必衆。因瀋變驟發。激於民族義奮。起而與横暴之侵略者肉搏抗爭。其犧牲於敵人刀劍之下。前方火砲之中者。正不知其幾千萬也。此種壯烈之死傷。雖未足以恢復東北。然亦足爲民族爭光。使東北失陷之歷史生色。頃者一般東北靑年。回念前塵。旣不勝其憤慨。而又目擊侵略者雄心未已。希圖整個併吞東北。使昔日之東三省。變爲今日之朝鮮。則其悲憤之情緒。自較内地靑年尤爲過之。吾人逆料此籍隸東北四省靑年中之智識分子。除一二投降日帝國主義者外。未有不以恢復故土爲念者也。</p>
<p>惟今日之中國。受病已深。欲於此時衝破當前之難關。須先有相當時期之安定。由此定。而後進謀有條理之建設。而後進謀充足實力之凖備。備於是一般靑年。以爲河淸難俟而煩悶愈深。然此亦毌怪其然。蓋彼原籍原北之靑年。當九一八事變未興之前。其一般經濟生活。因東北經濟情形較内地爲優裕。</p>
<p>故其個人生活環境亦較佳。乃一旦遭此空前未有之打擊。一夜之間。遂使往日繁富之區。論爲異域。生活憑藉。陡被推翻。甚或財產盡被没收。無路可歸。不得已而轉道平津。前途茫茫。不知所屆。此種情景。甚可悲憫者也。</p>
<p>在平津及其他各地由東北轉學而來之靑年學生。總計當在一萬左右。政府當局已通令各學校。凡東北學生皆免收學費。近且擬定津貼辦法。一以勉勵受難靑年之勤學。一以救濟無家可歸之學子。此誠振起民族意識之一道。然而東北全境正在受敎育時期之靑年與幼年。統計總數。至少在四十萬以上。今受日人壓迫。或以經濟上被剝削。不能續受敎育。或感日人之政治驅迫。不願接受其奴隸式敎育。或爲地方所限。或爲勢力所迫。屈處日軍鐵蹄下。長日呻吟而無可告語者。更不知幾十百倍於今日流落關内之失學靑年也。今者此屈處於日軍鐵蹄下之靑年。固已無法招徠。而飄流於關内之東北學生。則應盡力急施救濟。以免其失學并兾其有所造就。將來爲國服勞。任救國之艱鉅工作。此最所不可忽視者也。</p>
<p>抑我人更有言者。失學之靑年。固應急予救濟。而因抗日流落。家產淪没。無路可走之人。亦不宜長使失業。窮無所歸。致將來民族運動中多一重煩難。興念及此。我國今日失業羣廣大。苦無法救濟者正多。又豈僅東北難民而已。不遇東北難民。受災最深。被難最烈。故於救濟東北學生之際。同時尤應速施救濟東北難民之方策。或興辦公共事業。或舉辦東北人所特長之產業。務使失業之人。皆有工作。無論其爲農。爲工。爲智力勞動。爲商業運輸。必皆使之轉入生產行程之中。與中國復興之前途。當亦不無補益也。</p>

<p>平凖基金運用限爲兩年</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統所提出之貨幣法律草案、經參議院銀行委員會以十五票對二票之多數通過、但附以修正案二項、其一規定匯兌調節基金、應另設委員會以管理之、委員五人、一爲財政部長、一爲聯邦凖備銀行理事長、一爲貨幣稽核員、此外二人則由大總統指派之、　第二修正案、則係將匯兌調節基金之存在、在理論上以二年爲限度、但授權總統於必要時得延長限期云、一般人現慮貨幣不能兌現、多主張新美元應依照法國現行制度、得兌現大條金、且深慮該法案通過後、信用膨脹幾無限制、或致物價猛漲、而引起又一度之金融恐慌、白宮方面亦明白此種危險、故羅斯福表示、將日前用以雇傭四百萬工人之民事工程經費、至五月一日卽行停止云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英國遠東海軍將以新加坡爲集中點</h3>
<p>坎特號艦上進行秘密會議</p>
<p>歐戰名將愛倫璧東遊之謎</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英國愛倫璧上將曾在歐戰中享盛名、現將往遊遠東、此項消息、已使新加坡等處發生愛倫璧上將行將參加英國遠東海軍會議之推測、雖愛倫璧自稱、渠往東方、僅屬消遣性質、但終未能銷釋參加會議之謡言、故海陸軍部不得不發否認之文、聲明愛倫璧上將純以私人資格往遊遠東、未有何種官塲使命、且愛倫璧上將目前並非在職人員云、</p>
<p>路透社聞諸可靠方面、報紙推測與新加坡海軍會議及防禦工程有關者、率皆言之過甚、據官塲聲明、新加坡會議僅爲一種自動的尋常事件、而防禦工程則不過按照許多年前所已通過之政策而行耳、此種政策、閣員已屢在衆院言之、今旣未有新發展、亦未變更原定純粹地方防禦政策也云、</p>
<p>此說與外傳種種大相逕庭、報紙推測究從何來、溯其原因、殆由於新加坡海軍會議之秘密舉行、會議在英艦坎特號上行之、而此艦則泊於新加坡港中之最隠僻地點、此謡言之所以紛起也、</p>
<p>聞議程有下述四項、（一）新加坡將來爲海軍集中點之討論、（二）海軍根據地各種工程之進行、（三）遠東時局、（四）與當地艦隊有關係之一般事件、惟海軍部未曾宣佈議程、故上述四項之是否確實、猶未可盡信、</p>
<p>新加坡之會議始於一九二一年、惟目前所舉行者乃過去八年中之第一次、列席者除駐華英艦隊總司令德萊友中將、那斯密士中將、達爾格立施少將、及華生少將外、尚有海峽殖民地總督金文泰、及馬來總指揮阿爾德菲等人、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　每日電聞今日載有社論、謂新加坡海軍會議所引起之注意、證明英帝國在遠東海上及太平洋上之政策問題漸臻重要、又謂美日兩國積極海軍政策所造成之狀態、固未必損及英帝國之利益、但事有頗明瞭者、審愼得行考慮新加坡防務所必要諸端、今已臻其時矣云云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　標凖晚報發表社論、評論新加坡英國海軍會議開幕、略謂各方對新加坡新軍港主張善於利用、且須加以防守、此項會議不啻對此項主張加以批准、由英帝國立塲言、此會意義甚爲重大、該報旋說明新加坡防守計劃、謂英國在遠東絶對有駐紥海軍之必要、該報繼稱、任何人如指出時局之嚴重、誠有被人譏爲凖備戰爭之虞、但英國商務所必經之海道、必須加以保護、則爲全世界明達之士所一致承認者也、新加坡軍港不足爲一種威脅、日本已了解之、日本外相廣田最近之演說、不嘗謂東西兩大海軍國、地位相同、彼此實有和衷共濟以維持和平之可能乎、英國之態度正欲如此、總之、新加坡軍港地有益於和平、而非凖備戰爭也、云云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美大海軍計畫</h3>

<p>日議會質問戰</p>
<h3>民政黨議員高唱積極對華</h3>
<p>廣田答稱容徐圖之</p>
<p>對列國必先求諒解</p>
<p>（東京）　今日之衆議院本會議、於下午一時十九分開會、開始向國務大臣質問、民政黨之町田忠治登壇謂、促進「滿洲國」之發達、一面對列國解釋無用之猜疑、爲最關緊要、因此必需積極的外交工作、、卽對於中國不待其覺司、而必由日本實施令中國覺悟之外交工作、對於其他之確保親善關係、政府曾否採取積極方法、又一九三五年之危機、日本不得不以正義以上之外交手段、貫澈日本主張云云、高唱積極外交工作之必要、民政黨均拍手贊成、後由廣田外相答復、謂日本對於「滿洲國」之信念、自然將令列國逐漸理解、至對華之積極工作、余亦贊成、惟客觀情形、不容急速爲之、擬緩步行之、一九三五年亦無難關、與美亦努力於互相諒解、所謂危機之言辭、當無令國民與隣國迷惑也、（廿四日電通電）</p>
<h3>床次宣言决心護憲</h3>
<p>（東京）昨日政友會顧問床次竹二郎在國會之演說、甚爲各界所注意、其中有兩點足支配政局、一則力倡議會政治、爲欽定憲法所明定之制度、不可輕輕放棄、二則舉日俄戰爭及中日戰爭爲例斯時日政黨一致支持日軍部作戰、使日軍在沙塲得勝、政黨政治與戰爭政策有益無損、床次之演說係坦白表明政黨之决心、對於政民兩黨之合作運動貢獻不少、兩黨之合作或從此加速度實現云、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<h3>追究軍部宣傳戰爭</h3>
<p>（東京）　政友會議員安藤正純今日在下院質問政府、反對政府尤其是軍部壓迫言論、安藤質問之大綱如左、（一）國嵺法西斯獨裁論甚盛、欲倣德意兩國之獨裁政治、將日本之政治歸少數掌管、政府對此運動之意見如何、（二）軍部極力宣傳一九三六年有戰爭、其根據何在、（三）軍部近來採取秘密主義、一切之重要問題、不願給國民知道、究竟軍部相信無國民之援助、軍隊亦能對外戰爭否、</p>
<h3>日本鼓吹戰爭引起各國反感</h3>
<p>軍部懸崖勒馬擬予取締</p>
<p>（東京）　日軍部少壯派軍官之言論、在美俄意各國被認爲日軍部有意造成戰爭、各出版公司及雜誌副刋等、爲投時好過事戰爭之宣傳如「日之出」之日美戰爭未來記及「我海軍」在美國被没公、現代所登之末次司令長官之言論、被美國海軍軍令部責爲挑撥戰爭之文章等、各國對軍部言論萬分注意、昨日在日國會亦起問題、要求政府取締挑撥戰爭之出版物、聞陸軍省亦鑑及内外空氣萬分危急擬取</p>
<p>締此種言論云、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　東報稱、舊金山美報對廣田外相之演辭評謂、日已愛和平、美亦莫不求和平、然日出版界與軍人勾結、極力鼓吹戰爭、而對美尤甚、日政府准其出版業與新聞業者刋載恫嚇美國並破壞美國軍事機關之文章、對此種文字應嚴重取締云、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（四）軍部極力壓迫國民之言論、一意欲使國民相信三六年有戰爭、又不准國民顧問因何有戰爭、果然有戰爭否、軍部之存心何在、（五）軍部昨年發出反對離間軍民聲明書、軍部之眞意在於壓迫言論乎、或果有此種事實、林陸相之答復甚簡、大角海相又謂不便舉事實答復、如果舉事實答復、對外有影響、可開秘密會領敎、因民政黨追究甚急、軍部亦不容再辭、遂同意開兩秘密會、說明軍部之立塲、至下午</p>
<p>四時四十八分始畢、（二十四日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　民政黨系統之上院議員加藤政之助、今晨在國會質問財政問題及軍備、責軍部故意過事戰事宣傳、挑撥戰爭、其演辭大綱如次、世界經濟恐慌、各國之財政均告不足、並作日本一國之困難、惟英國經兩年之努力、出入已相抵、日財政部有意取範於英國否、軍部極力宣傳一九三五年之危機、究竟軍部所謂危機指某種事實而言、現時國民因受軍部之宣傳、多信一九三五年有戰爭、致使財界取消極態度、不敢積極投資、觀察美國及俄國之内情、若日本不挑戰兩國、决無戰爭、因軍部宣傳戰爭、使財政部犧牲一切、擴大無用之軍備、國家在進步時期、可不必取收縮財政之政策、惟八年與九年之預算比較、明年之預算已逾二十三萬萬元、政府有意增稅否、對公債仍使日本銀行收買否、（廿四日華聯電）</p>
<h3>廣田外交演辭各國輿論反響</h3>
<p>不啻宣佈亞洲門羅</p>
<p>抱有控制中國野心</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日本廣田外相在貴族院之演說引起此間報界兩種解釋、互相矛盾、其一謂日本有意侵略中國全部、其一謂廣田之態度、表示温和、意欲與歐美接近、政界人士所見、則折衷於兩者之間、謂廣田之意、似宣佈一種亞洲門羅主義、此種主義、由其本身言之、自非無詞可執、第於英國在遠東利益之發展、或有所不利耳、政界人士以爲廣田演說之意義、不過如此、並不若「每日民聲報」及泰晤士報所言之甚、前者謂日本有控制全中國之野心、後者謂日本將與歐美合作、皆各走極端者也、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日俄關係日趨緊張美俄携手日感威脅</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　日本陸相荒木大將之辭職、法國方面評論者尚少、因荒木辭職之關係、與其對日本外交政策之影響如何、此間尚未接得充分消息故也、惟一般人對于下列一事、甚爲滿意、卽日俄關係雖始終緊張、但衝突一層、已似不致必然發生、最近蘇俄重工業代表加昻諾維契發表演說、誠然表示蘇俄方面之重大憂慮、但一般人以爲美俄恢復常態關係一舉、不啻予日俄緊張情形、以一種安神之藥劑、實太平洋穏定之一種因素云、（加氏係共產黨中央委員會及莫斯科區委員會書記）、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>各國正忙籌對日政策非和平空言所能收效</h3>
<p>（柏林）　柏林交易所日報評論日本外相在貴族院之演說、認爲大政治家之傑作、其言曰、「由廣田演說、可見日本對於中國時局及日俄關係、極爲重視、日本對蘇俄在中國之活動、注意觀察、且保留干涉之可能、廣田明謂日本與蘇俄國交之進展如何、全視蘇俄對「滿洲國」採取如何態度而定、廣田外相對日本在太平洋上和平努力一再言之、但们日本國力之發展、足以引起若干危險一層、似亦未嘗諱言、」該報結論謂、「美國國會旣有海軍建</p>
<p>築案之提出、而英國紐西蘭澳洲等處海軍司令在新加坡又有帝國海軍會議之舉行、而蘇俄共產黨中央委員會及莫斯科區秘書加昻諾維契在莫斯科城區黨大會中、亦發表關於國際政策之演說、則國際衝突所可發生之地方、以及衝突之性質如何、概可想見矣」云云（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本對軍縮的準備工作（東京通信）</h3>
<p>召集外陸海三部聯合恊議會</p>
<p>已决定對付軍縮的原則三項</p>
<p>日本自去年三月通告通出國際聯盟之後、到明年就算滿足兩個年了、就以往一年中日本政治上的情形、軍事的行動上看、</p>
<p>明年三月以前當然没有歸復國聯的希望、然則、再過一年多的時光、日本就要正式退出國際聯盟、於是當前就發生三個重大的問題、</p>
<p>（一）南洋羣島委任統治的歸還問題、</p>
<p>（二）「滿洲國」不爲世界各國所承認的問題、</p>
<p>（三）海軍軍備縮小問題、</p>
<p>日本軍部各領袖與政府對第一問題、已决定硬行强佔、决不還給國聯、因爲加洛林和馬利亞納兩羣島、日本已有了相當的軍事設備、對美對英都有了軍事上的凖備、所以現時以至於今後絶不肯隨便就對南洋羣島放手、傀儡國的情形、卽在日本國内除軍部當局而外、都不免有些隔膜、可是那個地方祇有日本的軍國主義者纔口說牠是國家、而世界各國自去年夏季以後、莫不一致排日、其排日的原因、雖然都應該歸着到經濟、但是政治上却不能不說是日本慫恿溥儀製造傀儡的結果、美國曾經申明反對、英國也策動排日、恐怕事實的推移、不能够永久放任、讓日本横行於東亞、</p>
<p>雖然在日本軍界樂觀論者方面、以爲美國在太平洋的艦隊、（大西洋艦隊在内）將於今年四月一同復航大西洋、此與日本的立塲確有相當諒解、也就是對日表示好感之處、所以廣田的新外交政策、特别對美示好、他以爲日美之間直接的武力衝突性很少、目前的危機大有挽回的可能、殊不知事實却不是如此、美國的艦隊今年秋季依然要回到太平洋來、這個艦隊之存立於太平洋上、雖不必卽爲挑戰作用、可是無疑的是對日本的威脅、假使日本再繼續預下去、日美的危機必愈積愈多、終於祗有一戰、現時美國固然不能採取攻勢、｜美國的海軍實力没有戰勝的把握、｜然而美國把大西洋艦隊都集中在太平洋、同時把那些不適用的軍艦改裝起來、又在擴張空軍、舊金山與夏威夷間的長途飛航、也是一種有軍事上得大意義的試練、並且還要照倫敦條約所允許的數量、建造新艦艇、</p>
<p>日本對於這些事實變遷的注意、當然决不肯放鬆、　除了積極應付作第二次海軍補充計劃之外、外交上也有了凖備、特别是應付第二次海軍會議、日本於國際軍備問題的凖備工作、大要如下、</p>
<p>（一）由外務部歐美局長召集陸海軍關係者組織三部聯合恊議會、每週開會一次、研究歐美所發生的新問題、同時由外務·陸軍·海軍·三部課長和大佐以上的官吏、組織軍縮調查研究委員會、對軍縮爲專門的研究、由該委員會、蒐集軍縮一切的資料、並擬具對列國的對案、</p>
<p>（一）外務·陸軍·海軍·三部的大臣次長以及有關係各局長各部長爲委員、組織三部軍縮幹部會、他們以爲一九三五年六月將由英國或美國發出軍縮會議的請柬、所以日本最遲當於本年十月完成其一切凖備工作、</p>
<p>至於日本對於軍縮的原則、第一、是標榜自主的立塲、不受任保牽制、要求海軍軍備平等、徹底推翻華盛頓條約所規定的比率、第二、關於議題的範圍、日本主張以「海軍保有量」「沿海岸的防備」、「海軍根據地」等海軍關係爲限、絶對反對涉及其他政治問題、換一句話說、就是不能重提華盛頓九國公約、第三、各國對軍縮如有預備會議、則日本必須參加、否則卽拒絶出席於本會議、這是日本應付一九三六年危機的一種方策、也可以從此看出日本所謂國策之一斑、（一九三四年一月十八日於東京）</p>

<p>乃由茶房飛報賬房間、轉報該管捕房、派探馳來、用救護車將男女二屍、載送仁濟醫院、經醫生勘騐、係服阿芙蓉膏自殉、當將屍體轉舁騐屍所、候報法　勘騐、在房中搜出紙包一個、内中盡係照相信件甚夥、然並無遺書、隨由探員帶入捕房存案、</p>

<h3>滬沙輪局翻沉拖船兩艘</h3>
<p>船小貨多出口遇險</p>
<p>損失約一萬四千元</p>
<p>停班辦理賠償手續</p>
<p>新聲社云、本埠盆湯弄蘇州河沿岸老公茂輪船局西首滬沙輪船局、本月二十日開小輪拖帶貨船三艘、滿裝糖雜貨之類、於淸晨三時許、由蘇州河駛出外江大達公司一號碼頭時、爲巨浪所激、拖船觸及鐵錨、當塲沉没貨船二艘、損失約一萬四千元、兹將詳情調查如下、</p>
<p>成立未久</p>
<p>滬沙輪船局、成立不滿一年、經理名金匯東、係由滬張輪船局經理喬念椿·與金匯東·及崑山太倉各地商人所合組、由滬開航於崑山·太倉·雙鳳·直塔·沙頭·各埠、所用輪船、係與滬張輪船局合作、董事會設於太倉萬泰醬園内、平時專以運輸各地貨物爲大宗、</p>
<p>出險原因</p>
<p>此次因適係舊歷年關、崑山太倉沙頭各地南貨號、在滬均採辦年貨、合向本埠均益糖行等購辦紅白糖及海味等雜貨、託由該輪局裝運、計裝貨船三艘、用小輪拖帶、惟貨船船身甚小、而三船分裝、計有五百包以上、同時該局輪船、向駛蘇州河内河水道、故往來較易駕駛、是日因蘇州河淤塞未通、各内河輪船、均改由浦江繞道、該輪船局以所裝年貨、均係應時物品、不能久擱、遂亦改駛外江、以期早日送到</p>
<p>翻沉經過</p>
<p>惟因駕駛者、對於外江行駛、缺乏經騐、加以前數日中、天時陰霾·潮汛較大、潮趁風勢、江流益急、故雖冒險駛出、僅至大達公司一號碼頭、卽遭巨浪所激、貨船反觸大鐵錨上、船小載重、頓遭沉没、船員四人、亦落江中、幸斯時適有公安局水巡隊駐守警察幣見、故不待呼救、卽經駕船救起、得告無恙、其餘一船、亦經船員及水警等竭力施救、幸未覆没、當卽駛回輪局、覆没兩船、於是日午後、始在大達碼頭浮起、惟糖貨已飽魚腹矣、</p>
<p>損失萬餘</p>
<p>事後調查、覆没兩船、均係均益所裝糖貨、計四百百包、所幸一船獲救、計裝糖雜貨約一百餘包、總計値洋一萬五千元、故此次所蒙損失、據輪局中人稱、當在一萬三千以上、又悉均益糖行等、已先收欵、故此項交涉、係由沙頭横涇等各地南貨號與輪船局直接辦理、</p>
<p>停班會商</p>
<p>滬沙輪船局自出險後、業已停止開航、股東喬念椿·經理金匯東·等、曾於二十二日在太倉萬泰醬園董事會開會、討論善後辦法、並由經理金匯東、赶至沙頭、與各南貨商直接磋商賠償辦法、聞將來决照原價酌賠若干成、一俟賠償交涉完竣後、始行設法復開、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣訓練我們的頭腦（二）</h3>
<p>｜｜答許樂眞君</p>
<p>在答覆你所提出的幾個問題之前，我們不</p>
<p>能不對於你表示一番敬意。你能那樣自謙的對過去生活認眞的檢查，這是非常難得的。不過，我們對你目前懷抱的「希望」｜｜「養成一個有組織，嚴密，　敏和健全的頭腦……做一個</p>
<p>認識時代的人。」｜｜雖然也是完全同意的，但同時也還有些補充的意見，先寫出來供你參考。</p>
<p>第一，你的「希望」好像有點離開了實踐，很抽象的提出似的。固然你想「做一個認識時代的人」，是很正確的，但這結論的引出，不是從你生活奮鬥中，辛酸的經歷中而來。你全信中叙述「環境」不過寥寥十餘字，全信寫的是過去的讀書生活，讀書以外，似乎你頗忽視其他一切了。所以你讀書變成了無目的，與實際生活不配合，又似乎每一門都未完全達到應用；並且門類也很雜，根據來信，也就看出你對實際生活太隔離，太漠視，完全陷於所謂「純粹學人」的態度，你想把你自己先造成了一個完人，然後去認識時代，或者做點什麽（這一點你都未提出，不過是我的推測。）這是我們認爲一個很大的缺點。</p>
<p>第二，因爲有了以上的觀念，所以你就想到「什麽學科會使我的腦力嚴密，健全，靈敏並剷除無謂的空想，妄想。」這在表面看來，萬分正確，但一經現實的實騐，然知道這還是一種空想。科學確有訓練人的頭腦健全，嚴密，靈敏的作用，但頭腦的健全，嚴密，靈敏祗能在社會生活中養成，不能依靠科學，科學提示的是方法，腦的訓練在運用。至於剷除無謂的「空想，妄想」，尤不是專門依靠理智的。此間就不少理敎學家，同時他是最多空想的人。破除「空想，和妄想」也祗能在實際生活中，以有組織的合理生活去代替散漫多閑的生活，方有可能。（未完）</p>

<h3>天賜莊之雪</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>「塡平世匕崎嶇路，飛入人間富貴家。」這是歌頌雪的公平，但是崎嶇之路，雖暫時的表面的塡平，不久還是要露出眞面目來。並且餘雪未融，結了冰更見滑滑難行。至於富貴之家，見了雪，要端正了羊羔美酒來欣賞，絲毫没有感到冬的嚴厲。那麽所謂一公平亦僅矣」了！</p>
<p>天賜莊是蘇州的特别區，不是治權上的話，乃是環境上的話。我們走了望星橋，過了幾家小店以後，就覺得豁然開朗，約翰堂和博習醫院門前的冬靑樹，好似聖誕節綴着棉花的聖誕樹，表示他的純潔之愛。望見病宗裏白衣冠的看護，往來蹀　，不知道臥在病榻上的有没有知道老天下了大雪，能不能掙紥起來望望城齒咬雲，野田種玉的奇觀。</p>
<p>東吳大學幾株法國梧桐，本來淸　如老人，現在堆了雪，臃腫肥壯了，草地的枯黃全換了潔白，不覺得冷的可怕，只覺得靜的可喜。雖是靑年們還在活動，搏着雪野戰，到底躱在屋子裏的多。登到最上層去，「雙塔」並峙在不遠的叢屋中，好似孩子們把雪疊着頑的。一切都添了詩情和畫意，除掉老天，誰有這偉大的游戲？覺得「未若柳絮因風起，」不脫女孩字家小心思。「戰罷玉龍三百合，殘鱗片甲滿天飛。」也組豪得太不相稱。倒是紅樓夢上香菱姑娘的「參天玉樹寒無影，墮地銀河凍不流，」是在細看着雪，是在細寫着雪，尤其是今日的天賜莊，可以把這兩句詩來描盡，來題詠。因爲天賜莊有無數參差的樹，有廣大的塲，悠長的路。</p>
<p>凌敎授的宅子裏，華燈之下，坐着一個冒雪而來的「老曲先」撅着笛侍候凌敎授打起精神，從丹田裏唱出他「官生」的崑曲來，隨着笛聲飄到雪的匼匝中。接着又是「雨絲風片，烟波畫船。」女孩兒家的　喉嚨。啊！不是禮拜堂晚禮拜堂晚禱的鐘，不是悲啊娜和凡亞林，不是「夢中情</p>
<p>人」的歌，這片時間的天賜莊，是我們的了。</p>
<h3>雪後</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>老天把滿臉的鉛灰洗掉，露出一張漂亮的臉。</p>
<p>橋欄上堆着一層雪，不過，薄得像霜那麽樣的。橋面上太滑了些兒，年紀輕脚勁好的人，不至於滑跌，像伊這麽樣一圙年老力衰的老婆子，四肢已凍的麻木，就着實吃力了呢。</p>
<p>空身子又比較好些。可是，伊不能丢掉那隻相依爲命的花生籃，腋下再挾柄破紙傘，緊緊的讓自家兒枯萎的身子給那襲又厚，又髒，又破得不成模樣的襖兒裹着。挨一步喘一口氣，那雙小脚，在泥漿上踐出很明顯的三角形。</p>
<p>够小心的伊左手抓住橋欄，讓冷的雪片子貼上手心，讓冷的浦江面上刮來的野風，尖刀般的戮進肌膚。挨一步，喘一口氣，伊要挨過這頂橋。</p>
<p>伊自己從没這樣想過：　老了，没有用了。』</p>
<p>然而，確實是没用了，『叱哎』跌啦，花生滾開去。滾開去｜伊生命的源泉。年老人血氣衰弱，怎經得起跌。一跌就不容易爬起。笑聲，在周圍是不少，但，扶伊起來的胳膊是没有呵。要在這社會上找同情嗎？比找什麽都難。</p>
<p>老婆子不再等路人的攙扶，不再等人與人之間應有的互助精神。伊掙扎着爬了起來，花白的頭髮，花白的眼。</p>
<p>籃拾起來了，破紙傘拾起來了，又拾起了泥漿中的花生。</p>
<p>在橋上，抬起瘦小的腦袋，望到那排洋屋頂上魚鱗兒般的積雪，茫然的。</p>
<p>伊感覺到只有伊獨個子在這茫然的人世上站立着了。</p>
<h3>爐火熊熊</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>在嚴冬，我們見到爐火熊熊，自然是很歡喜的。這是它熱的力吸誘了人們！</p>
<p>上海的舞塲，個個都擁擠不堪，舞客們不因天寒而减少，樂聲鏗鏘，舞客們擁抱了舞女，一個旋律的一個旋律的舞着，這是的熱力吸誘了人們！</p>
<p>上海妓院，内地私娼，在冬之夜，生涯更好，窗外白雪皚皚，窗内兩情繾綣，兩人熱似火，怎知窗外寒？道又是一種熱力吸誘了人們！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十三回　創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂歡情未洽促别到飛符</p>
<p>積之正呆望着，有哥哥一個聽差由門裏出來，也不等他說話，就笑道：你看，這豈不是一種無聊的舉動。聽差笑道：二爺將來辦喜事，一定是在城裏飯莊子上辦。積之道：我呀……說着，淡淡的笑了，不向下說了。聽差笑道：你瞧，人家也是文明結婚，軍樂隊花馬車，全來啦。積之向前看時，可不是嗎？一大班穿紅色衣服的軍樂隊，帶着大鼓銅笛，向趙家門裏來，同時，一輛花馬車，慢慢的行來，在趙家門口停住。積之道：這可就怪啦。他們男家在這大門裏，女家也在這大門裏，要這花馬車何用？他說這幾句話，聲音未免高一點，那個茶水爐子邊下，就有一個人走近前來笑道：二爺短見啦。女家借着我們店裏辦事呢，這裏光算是男家。回頭就打發花馬車到我們那　邊娶新娘子。積之被那人呌着，注意起來，就認得他了，乃是乳茶舖裏的一個伙計。便笑道：你還兼着這一行買賣啦，伙計笑道：我們掌櫃，原來就是幹這一行的。鄉下辦事的少，這才在海甸街上，開了一家乳茶舖的。積之笑道：你們也太會作生意了，攬了男家的買賣，又把女家拉到你們那裏去。這一來，男家又得多花一筆花馬車的錢。伙計笑道：您這正是把話倒來說着，人家爲的是要露一露花馬車，女家才挪到我那裏去的。我說到這裏，回頭看了看人，才低聲笑道：不想楊家老姑娘，嫁給了這位趙連長。積之聽他這話，心裏動了一動，便向伙計笑道：你這話有些不通。你覺着他不應該嫁趙連長，又應該嫁誰呢？</p>

<h3>掙扎線上的人</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>淸晨的空氣怪冷的，我雖則坐在牆角頭晒太陽，實際上可並得不到什麽暖意，因爲陽光是徼弱得可憐。</p>
<p>彭，彭，彭，小鏜鑼響着，一個人牽着一隻猴子，另外一個人擔着一些要猴子的傢伙。在弄堂裏敲着敲着，走着走着，可没有一個小孩子出來看熱閙。那兩個要猴子的想走，然而又停了。他們在耐着心兒等，希望有意外的觀衆，意</p>
<p>外的獲得。</p>
<p>但是天冷，而且是淸晨，孩子們都匿居在室内，雖有鑼聲的誘騙，可仍不願意出外。要猴子的只好失望地走了，帶着寂寞的心情，寂寞的悲哀。</p>
<p>爲生活，他們不能不冒着朝寒出來走動，出來東穿西穿吸引穉幼的觀衆。無疑的，他們是悽苦的掙扎綫上的人。</p>
<p>一忽見，又來了拾垃圾的母女倆。母是五十多歲中年以上的婦人，女却祗還是十二三歲的小姑娘。母女倆在垃圾桶裏敏捷的翻檢着，大槪是淸晨的緣故罷，垃圾桶裏的廢物似乎儲藏得很富，那母親竟大着膽子把底下的門也開了出來，在怱忙地像是滿意地撮拾着，却不料旁邊走來一個住在附近的老者，大聲的把伊們斥駡，並且驅趕着。</p>
<p>母女倆還戀戀地不肯走，那老者却逕自走向外面去了。於是，女兒在巡風，母親依舊在拾。但好像窮人的命總是苦的，那老者又從外面回來了，母親接受了女兒的通知，母女倆又　促的挾着籃子走了。｜我非常不平，窮人連拾垃圾的自由都没有。</p>
<p>據我看，那母女倆走的時候也是深深地感到悲哀的，母親是那樣沉靜，女兒是那樣乖巧。可是爲生活，伊們不能不受着人們的蔑視而幹那卑賤的營生，無疑的　　同樣是悽苦的掙扎線上的人。</p>
<h3>影星訪問</h3>
<p>— 雲巖</p>
<p>好久要想去見見那位電影權威者胡蝶女士，可是，去訪了幾次，都没有見到，明星公司的司閽老山東，倒也非常客氣。不然，像我一個落拓的人，去訪這樣一位時代佳人，眞是唐突西子了。遺好，居然承他的情很客氣地答復我。昨天，踏雪閑逛又踏上了杜美路，脚裏明白，走到了明星公司的大門口了，我又去間那位老山東，胡小姐回來了嗎。這回可是眞倖運，他說：方纔汽車進去，你自己走到會客室去，自有人照呼你的。我連忙向裏邊走，問了一個信，自己還通報了姓名。一怱兒，一位明眸皓齒的姑娘立在我面前了，看伊臉上有些風塵之色，一望而知伊纔從遠道回來，還没有重施脂粉呢。我鞠了一個躬，陳訴了數句仰慕的話，伊很歉和的對答着，不時看見到一面梨渦的笑痕。後來，我問到了道次上南京去的情形，伊說：很不安，承蒙首都的觀衆垂靑，捧塲，勉强没有出醜。不過，歸途趁的是夜車，南京的雲下得很大，天氣冷得很，我們同去的諸位，都受了些風寒，有的鼻子　，有的發寒熱，我也有些頭脹怕風呢，所以就要想回去休息休息，……我也就告退出來了。</p>

<h3>我也來談談金魚</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>吳吉人君，送給我一本金魚飼養法，讀了興趣盎然，也來談談金魚，以凑熱閙。　金魚是鯽的變種，所以一稱金鯽，蘇舜欽詩：沿橋待金鯽，古時鑰形似魚，李商隠又有牢合金魚鏁桂叢的句，前天烟橋的老弟劍威喜宴席上，卓呆說：把蠶蛾的子，散在新的方甎上、在烈日中曝乾，然後抛在水裏，可以變爲金魚，但是他也是聽人家傳說的，没有試騐過，今年他擬在勞圃的池子裏，如法一試，不知道能否成功。</p>
<p>金魚中有珍珠鱗一種，世所未見，頭額紅如鹤頂，尾温潤如玉　周身細鱗突起，顆顆圓形，彷彿穿着一件珍珠衫，定遠方調臣先生有詩道：「我家盆池淸且漣，中有游魚洋洋焉，一魚赤鱗白其嶺，一魚碎點如星懸，其中一魚眞矯然，細鱗突起比珠圓，分明一一相回旋，周身的礫銀絲穿，玉尾長曳可及肩，游行大腹何便便，更奇魚額紅而鮮，色若珊瑚圑若錢，（下略）」這詩可以收入養魚經，不知道魚樂國裏，有没有這珍珠鱗種？</p>
<p>長物志中，有觀魚吸水水缸三則，爲蓄金魚的所宜採納，「觀魚：一宜早起，日未出時，不論陂池盆盎，魚皆蕩漾於淸泉碧沼之間，又家凉天夜月，倒影揷波，時時驚鱗潑刺，耳目爲醒，至如微風披拂，琮琮成韻，雨過新漲，榖紋皺綠，皆觀魚之佳境也」，二吸水：「盆中換水，一兩日卽底積垢膩，宜用湘竹一段，作吸水筒，吸去之，倘過時不吸，色便不鮮美，故佳魚池中斷不可蓄」，三水缸：「有古銅缸，大可容二石，靑綠四裏，古人不知何用，當是穴中注油點燈之物，今取以蓄魚最古，其次以五色内府官窰瓷所燒，純白者亦可用，惟不可用宜興所燒化缸，及七石牛腿諸俗式，余所以列此者，實以備淸玩一種，若必按圖而索，亦爲板俗。」</p>
<p>黎黃陂没世有年，猶記他自下政治舞臺後，蟄居津門，頗以園亭花木，姬妾聲色，爲他暮年的娛樂，某姬，南方人，素性喜靜，花晨月夕，常盤桓在風廊水榭之間，所以四方有獻奇花異草的，都由伊吩咐園丁栽種，或獻金魚多尾，都是上品龍種，突睛麗色，鰭尾修長，某姬很是愛玩，特建濠亭，位置魚缸，有一天，金魚忽被一獅子形的狸奴所捕食，這狸奴是黃陂愛妾危夫人所蓄的，某姬没有知道，因愛護金魚，便把那狸奴重盤致死，危夫人的女僕，奔訴主人，危夫人大怒，堅請黃陂處置伊，某姬却以狸奴喪金魚多命，論罪當抵，各執一詞，黃陂再三調停，很費許多唇舌，某姬究屬新進，大家都袒危夫人，說：食魚是狸奴的本性，某姬不用他法制止，遽下賤酷手段，理屈，最後解决，把缸中所蓄金魚，盡行殺掉，以祭狸奴，危夫人氣雖平，然某姬憤極絶食，黃陂密許伊重購佳魚，纔得勉進粥湯，親信某戲對黃陂說：兩憎之間難爲魚，續一語道：兩愛之</p>
<p>間難爲夫，說的黃陂笑了起來。</p>

<p>多、如試卷試題試塲之編配、手續之繁、難以言喻、餘者時間經濟之浪費、猶屬餘事、欲求輕而易舉、對於各校呈報手續、固應力予簡便、而此種分區辦法、似以小爲便、會考時間、尚須提早、最好在五月下旬、因至七月太熱、政府辦公時間縮短、學生相聚多人、易生疾病、（二）全省應取同一敎材、宜指定出題參考書、俾學生練習能有依據、出題時宜多出問答題、少出測騐題、命題應從大處着眼、並重理解、而避免無謂之記憶、命題數量要多、每科總在十個以上、使所包括之敎材較廣、且有選答之機會、（三）核算成績、平日成績、應不計算在内、以免流弊、（四）復試辦法、手續殊嫌繁瑣、辦理極感不便、學生方面、惑受困難之處、亦多亟應改善辦法、（五）中小學生畢業會考委員之組織、應於襄試委員之外、增設主考委員及監試委員、以主試委員、分任各區主試事宜、襄試委員任擬題閱卷事宜、監試委員任監試事宜、（六）中小學畢業學生、每因參加會考、日夜凖備、用功過度、頗影響於身體健康、小學兒童發育、尚未完全、妨害尤甚、（七）該省各方對於會考規程第九條一科或二科不及格、應行復試之規定、均認爲廳方舉行中學會考後、評定成績、在在需時、辦理復試、頗多困難、而應考學生亦感受守候復試、所費甚巨、且因時間迫促、交通不</p>

<h3>世界短跑怪傑托倫放棄運動生活</h3>
<p>感覺失業苦痛</p>
<p>决計努力事業</p>
<p>世界短跑怪傑、黑人愛迪托倫、將宣告退隠、不再現身田徑塲、决計努力從事於其職業、按托倫爲百米二百米之世界亞林比克冠軍、密希干大學習醫、其自運動塲退隠、並無特殊不滿、僅爲找尋職業、去秋向各處尋找職業、皆告失敗、於是不得不歸提德洛愛故鄉、亞林比克抵家鄉之第二日、遇歡迎者之音樂隊、及其表兄富特蘭、富爲一苦工、托倫竟觸景生情、以爲其表兄職位雖卑、亦有職業、而彼則連父母亦不能供養、成一醫生之學業、亦只能中輟、而成一有名醫生、亦徒屬夢境耳、</p>
<p>密希干大學四年旣畢、一躍而爲世界短跑明星、其參加亞林比克預賽之前一日、致函其母云、如一躍爲冠軍、則家庭狀况、從此可以漸好矣、</p>

<h3>告熱心國貨的各地人士</h3>
<p>— 仰䒪</p>
<p>提倡國貨，不是限於一隅，是要全國各地，一齊起來努力一下，纔有效力。今年旣公定爲婦女國貨年，很多人說：「這個年頭，彷彿只有上海人在那裏起勁，各地方的人，還是𨶑無聲息，難道這一年是上海人的婦女國貨年嗎」？記者聽了，發了一個呆，後來一想，確是婦女國貨運動，還没有普遍的缺憾。我想各地方的男女人士，聽了也要發念的，明明是全國的婦女國貨年，爲什麽只熱閙上上海一地，各地方祚不響應，從此罷休嗎？倘使有血氣有毅力的熱心人，一定不肯旁觀，更一定不肯冷淡。吾以爲各地方的地方的宣傳運動，固然要緊。而入手的方法，莫如舉辦國貨公司，作實際上提倡國貨的總樞紐。現在中國國貨公司，在圓明園路一號有全國聯合辦事處的設立，正在分約全國各地人士，設立中國國貨公司，一切辦法，十分完善，凡屬都會以及通商大埠，都有詳細規定的標凖，因特介紹於下，希望各地熱心的人士，大家一致起來，開辦這種利人利己的國貨公司，在我們的理想，這一年中，至少全國各地要有二十個國貨公司出現。</p>

<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>婦女受駡年</h3>
<p>— 艾慈女士</p>
<p>翻開各報關於「婦女國貨年」的文稿一看，似乎作者都站在一條戰綫，向婦女界總攻擊：說去年的「國貨年」没有成績，都是婦女不用國貨的結果，而且有十個月外國進口的脂粉香水，達一百四十萬的統計，來證明婦女的奢侈，如果這種的作風不改變，我以爲與其名爲「</p>
<p>婦女國貨年」，不如改爲「婦女受駡年」，倒來得爽直啦。</p>
<p>男女都是國民，「婦女國貨年」的名稱，根本就來得幽默，談到國貨，誰都不能否認，我們的衣，食，住，行，一切的一切，都用國貨的，幾乎没有一個人了，說來是何等痛心啊！小孩子生後一天吃的代乳粉，有國貨嗎？各人的衣着，有是完全國貨的嗎？住的房屋，用的器具，全是國貨嗎？交通越便利，鐵道，公路，空路越多闢，火車，汽車，飛機有完全國貨嗎？你知道在「航空救國」的運動裏，送了多少錢到外國去了</p>
<p>嗎？我以爲不要借一百四十萬的數目，來做「婦女受駡年」的資料，因爲這不是提倡國貨的根本辦法。</p>
<p>記着有人說過，「歐美人創造，日本人仿造，中國人不造」，但是現在我們可以稍爲樂觀了：仿造的東西，實在不少，走進國貨公司去看看，不是有很好的成績展覽着嗎？本來祗要是國人資本，國人製造，卽使原料完全是外國貨，也合着規定的國貨標凖，大家買去服用，應當是愛國了吧？我現在用的稿紙，也是國貨，是天章出品，但是，有人說：「你這樣算愛國，還不澈底，你的確知道没有用外國原料嗎？你越提倡外國原料的國貨，金錢流到外國去，不是越多嗎？這不過五十步和百步的差罷了」。　　當然，原料自給的國家，世界上恐怕没有一國，但是現在靠外國供給原料最多的國家，恐怕要數我們第一了，我們會仿造，進了一步：我望生產界，再進一步，求原料自給，造出完全的國貨，售價可以廉，買的人一定多；否則明年成年年定一個「××國貨年」，一定不濟事的｜</p>
<h3>愛敬土貨和澈底的提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>自北大營砲聲響後，國人競思抵抗。瀋陽的飛機被奪了，於是以過山砲手溜彈作抵抗，以步機作抵抗，最後提倡以大刀抵抗，甚至以石子抵抗。中國人武力抵抗，漸漸的提倡土貨。據我看來，這武力抵抗非用最新的最摩登的方法不可。飛機毒彈排砲潛艇唐克車等，這是摩登抵抗方法。要是不能採用這方法還是老老實實不抗抵的好。</p>
<p>至於經濟上的抵抗，那是大不然，經濟上的抵抗就是提倡國貨。那是愈土愈好，愈土愈妙，印度甘地的好處妙處就在織土布，三個大字。日本工業製造已爲西洋各國所害怕。但是國内還拚命用土貨。吾們中國製造業尚未發達。一切衣食住所需的東西，如果不用本國原有土貨，是絶對不會自給自足的。譬如衣，你如果不穿綢緞土布，那麽一定要穿洋貨或華洋混合品。譬如食，你如果不吃砂糖，你一定要吃日本白糖。（西洋貨近來極少）譬如住，你如果不願意住杉木構造的中國式房屋。你一定會住洋松構造的西式房屋了。我並不是反對歐化，不過是說中國工業尚未發展的當兒，請你慢慢歐化罷了。如果大家都能認淸愈土愈妙的道理。你先要存一個愛敬土貨的心，這樣就是不能樣樣土化本國貨。至少能够抵抗一些外來的侵略。好在此種勝利，是如操左券。不折不扣，土一分有一分好處的。質言之，　就是愈土愈勝利。所以我說，武力抵抗，愈土愈失敗。經濟抵抗，愈土愈勝利。</p>
<p>廣東人受外國刺激最上。提倡國貨，也是最早。他們最初所用的口號，還是提倡土貨四字。請你看看南京路上先施永安各大公司，不是明明書寫統辦洋貨土貨麽？</p>

<p>作者在民國七八年的時候，在故鄉担任商業學校的校長。這時候我對於國貨的提倡，非常熱烈。我勸戒學生購用國貨，同時組織國貨商店，販賣國貨。自己是本身作則，不但穿的衣料全用國貨，並且家裏所用的東西，都用國貨。當時有一件可笑的事情。就是我夜間看書，竟然點起一盞舊式的菜油燈。不但不用電燈，並不用美孚油燈。這裏頭我有一種極堅忍的思想。那時我一方面受歐洲大戰的影響；一方面受日本「自給自足」主義的刺激。當時我看到一種日本雜誌上面載一篇銅山大王虎衛門的故事。這虎衛氏雖然是日本的豪富，但是他的個人生活，非常儉約。晚上看書用一種舊式的風燈。這篇傳記上還贊他是有「嶙嶙的奇骨」。並且有一張攝影，所攝的就是虎衛氏席地而坐，就風燈讀書的樣子。作者看了頗爲佩服。所以晚間讀書，改用最道地的國貨｜｜菜油燈。當時看書又看到印度甘地的故事。甘地憤印度的交通器具，爲英國人所襲斷，所以他出門的時候，不講什麽效率不效率，還是坐着印度舊式的木舟。那時作者在家鄉的一種雜誌上做篇論文，提倡國貨。中間有兩句話，引用上面兩件故事。說道：「當學虎衛之風燈，預儲實力於未亡之前。毌若甘地之木舟，徒留遺恨於已亡之後」。句子雖做得不行。但當時個人之所信，和意念之堅定，亦可想而知。</p>
<p>這樣一個土頭土腦的人，後來到上海做事，受了不少刺激和包圜，也有些沾不住了什麽呢帽嗶吱等等逐漸侵入我的身上了。上海人的崇拜來頭貨，蔑視本國風俗物品，實在是全國之冠。這是通商以來九十餘年中所造成的錯覺。去年提倡國貨定名國貨年，雖不標明男子，大槪男子有其較大的責任。提倡的結果，很慚愧，就一月至十月的統計，着，已有六萬萬元的輸入超過。今年是婦女國貨年，這責任的重心，是輪到一般的姊妹們了，看明年的統計怎樣。危險呀！</p>
<p>老年的太太們她們都能守一些舊習慣。年幼的女孩子她們是隨母姊怎樣是怎樣的。所以婦女國貨年的重心更在中年的姊妹們。如何打倒九十餘年來的錯覺，竭力提倡購用國貨，的確是今年姊妹們最大的責任。</p>

<h3>婦女們應認眞幹一下</h3>
<p>— 競存</p>
<p>我深信婦妇國貨年中的婦女，不僅僅要做一個國貨消息者，同時要做一個國貨生產者，可是現在的太太小姐們，要請龜們直接去參加國貨的生產工作，在她們認爲是降尊紆貴的一件事，無論如何是不可能，卽使可能，無論如何她們又是不肯去做。我深信婦女國貨年中的婦女，若不能直接或間接的參加或恊助國貨生產事業，都不配說是一個婦女國貨年中的婦女，都對不起社會今年對於婦女們的推崇。在國貨年的開頭，我曾經請求今年的婦女們拿出精神做出一些成績來，表現婦女的能力，以慰社會的渴望，過後，我曾經提出一個婦女要參加國貨生產事業的口號，做今年婦女們的工作目標，現在，婦女國貨年的一月，漸漸要過去了，婦女們所表現的成績在甚麽地方呢？難道婦女交誼大會就是婦女國貨年的成績嗎？難道請一位女士騎着馬指揮國貨運動遊行大會的行列，就是婦女國貨年的成績嗎？難道請一兩位名媛行國貨商塲或展覽會的揭幕禮，就是婦女國貨年的成績嗎？這不是，那不是，究竟怎樣纔算是婦女國貨年的眞實成績？請就我一時所想到的寫幾條出來：</p>
<p>（一）凡是結了婚的男子，都不敢再買一文的外國貨，以避免太太的責罰。</p>
<p>（二）子女們都知道用國貨是國民的責任，買外國貨是國民一種最大的恥辱。</p>
<p>（三）摩登的太太小姐們，身上，屋裏，胃裏，都找不出一種東西是舶來品。</p>
<p>（四）有知識的婦女們，把他們開會，交際的時間，應用到工廠裏去，做敎育女工和指導女工改善生活的工作。</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>（五）資產階級的婦女們，節省下她們的裝飾費，娛樂費，投資到國貨工廠裏去。</p>
<p>（六）到了年底，海關報告册上的入超數字，减少了好幾位，而化裝品的進口數量，幾等於零。</p>
<p>（七）每天的報紙上，都登載着小規模的家庭工業組織的產生和發展擴張的消息。</p>
<p>（八）上海薦頭行中待僱的婦女，日漸减少，一部份被國貨工廠吸收了去，擔任工作，一部分則回到農村去。從事她們的農村副業。</p>
<p>這上面的八點，是我一時所想到的婦女國貨年所應有的成績，也許有人說我把這婦女國貨年看得太認眞，我也承認，我想旣然規定着婦女國貨年，理應要認起眞來幹一下，我國人的一種大毛病，就是不認眞，所以甚麽事都没有成績，如果大家認眞的幹起來，這上面的八點，我想是不難做到的，如果大家不肯認眞的做，到了年底，依然表現不出一些成績來，我想建議改「婦女國貨年」爲「婦女風頭年」，請求地方恊會幾個團體追認一下，以期名副其實。</p>
<h3>告太太們幾句話</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>太太們！小姐們！請你們看，下列的幾段事。</p>
<p>也小知從那一年起，這些碧眼兒，倭子兒，他們都看中了我們，打開了我們的大門，把他們的剩餘商品，一大批，一大批的運進我國，同時，幾個較大的地方，通商口岸，都成了他們肆行搜括的巢穴，十幾層的單房。建築物。早聳五着。是洋行，是外國銀行，是外商在華所設的廠房。經之。都是來搜括我們血汗的塲所，這樣，一年年盈千盈萬的金錢，就由我們的袋裏。洪水滔滔的滾到外洋去。</p>
<p>接下去講，那些在華設廠的外商，他的資本是剩餘的，他看凖了我們所需要而缺乏的東西，就趕緊設法去製造而經營，並且，利用着我國最便宜的工資和原料，又仗着不平等條約做護符，這樣，他就佔着了初步的便宜。</p>
<p>再進一步，他們就把這些貨物，推進了我們的大公司，商店，靠我們這許多的洋貨推銷員去推銷了，别的不說，我們單看充滿洋氣的南京路上，販賣着洋貨的大公司，已有多少，到夕陽西沉，華燈初上的時候，一批，的摩登女郎，太太當她們從公司裏出來的時候，可以說那一個不在捧着她們心一愛的洋貨　　我們儘管地在和他們推銷着，但你們總也能看到他們｜｜滬西一帶富麗堂皇的洋房，那一宅不是這些搜括我們血汗，徒供他們享受的樂園，當然，我們更能想到，在馬路上横衝直撞的都是洋人所坐的汽車，向洋人低頭媚笑的，不單是平民，而還有政客和要人。</p>
<p>果然，這是我們自己不爭氣，無用多說的所以，别的年頭且不講，在國貨年，還顯露了入超九萬萬元的新紀錄。</p>
<p>我們的太太們，你們看了上面的話，可怒火上升，好！今年是婦女國貨年，正是你們出力的時候，祗要趕緊追去，過去是還不足慮的，啊！你們起來吧！</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年怎樣工作</h3>
<p>— 道而</p>
<p>去年是國貨年，但是海關入超還是四萬萬一千萬；並且去年國内的市面，比往年更壞，人民的購買力異常薄弱，但是購買舶來品，却還有這許多金錢流到外國去，假使這四萬萬一千萬都購買國貨，國貨工廠一定可以更加發達，這是無疑的。</p>
<p>現在國貨不能暢銷，誰都知道一大半原因，爲的是洋貨傾銷的關係，但是洋貨爲什麽可以使中國人情願買，我們也應該仔細研究。一般情願買洋貨的人，他們何嘗眞願意把金錢送給外國人，而對於國貨，何嘗一定痛恨厭棄；只因洋貨的式樣，又美麗，又便宜，國貨的花式旣少，價格又貴，自然在購買的時候被洋貨吸引着而不願買國貨了。</p>
<p>有人說購買洋貨，金錢外溢，不如買國貨，卽品質壞些，價格貴些，金錢總在本國。買國貨是國民的義務，也可以說是國民的道德，但是，這是一種理論，而事實上却不然。因爲各人經濟情形不同，他用便宜的價格，能買得較好的東西，他就顧不得國貨與非國貨；何况法律上又没有規定購買洋貨是犯罪，所以只能勸他購買國貨，而不能禁止他購買洋貨。國貨如果能式樣品質旣好且多。價格比洋貨便宜，自然不必勸人買，而自然暢銷。</p>
<p>所以，我以爲婦女國貨年勸婦女購買國貨，還是消極的提倡國貨，而不是積極的提倡國貨。如果要積極的提倡國貨，應該設法督促國貨工廠努力改良出品，代他設計與進行如何可使他成本改輕，售價可以儘量减低，一方面還要調查每一種的洋貨與國貨，把他的品質與售價，做成比較表，給國貨工廠去研究，怎樣才可以做得同洋貨一樣優美，或者還比洋貨更優美一些，同時除了工料減低成本，請求政府减低國貨稅率，國貨自然受任何人的歡迎了。大槪現在國貨吃的虧，大部份在花式少，樣子不及洋貨美觀，這是最大的原因，倘使在這上面先加研究，至少可以使購買力比較充裕的國人，先行採用，這一點因爲已有一個例子了。就像美亞織綢廠的綢緞，他們出品很多，而且質地與式樣，都比洋貨好，價格又低廉，最近所出二三春式蘿娜綢，中國婦女購買的人固已很多，而外國人也買的很多，可見一件貨品的暢銷，第一要品質優美，不必重言聲明這是國貨，才可以吸引他人購買的。國貨如果不改良品質，减低價格，雖是儘量宣傳，或者向各國人去演講國人必須提倡國貨購買國貨，也是事倍而功半。</p>
<p>今年是婦女國貨年，最好請熱忱婦女國貨運動諸君，先把婦女應用的物品研究一下，那幾種國貨應該怎樣改良或增加花式到如何程度，才適合於婦女的愛好與應用，第二步再設法在可能範圍内改輕價格，這是很有價値而切合實際的工作啊！</p>

<h3>國貨與義務心之養成</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬聶其杰述</p>
<p>今日國事衰敗至此，由於國民缺乏義務心，殆不可諱言，一般官吏，發財之意多，盡職之意少，想亦普通人同有之感覺也，大抵今日人民，對於政府及一切公共機關，皆有懷疑之意，更進一步言之，人民彼此相信之意亦薄，恐所付託之事，不能忠實代辦，此又人人同有之感覺也，此亦大可哀矣。凡一進步國家之進行，不徒賴有完善之法律與章程，而賴有多數富於責任精神之人，使之推行盡利，否則雖有治法，等於具文矣。所謂責任精神，卽義務心也。人民之義務心，不能驟然輸入，須有方法以養成之，中國自古之敎義，卽處處向此點着重，簡言之，卽使社會常有重義輕利之觀念是也，分而言之，各個人相對各有其義務，以五倫槪括之，實卽對於全羣之責任也，如忠義對於君而言，爲其代表全羣也。孟子言君之義最明「曰殘賊之人謂之一夫、聞誅一夫紂矣，未聞弑君也。」又「民爲貴，君爲輕。」故忠君所以忠於羣也。孔子曰，「君使臣以禮，臣事君以忠，」則事君以忠者，有相當之條件，必在謀人民利益範圍以内，而忠事之也，提倡忠義。卽養成責任心之善法，如我國社會崇拜關岳，讀其書者，則破敵除奸之念，自然奮發，北方重義俠，多厚俗，蓋受其影響甚大也。孝義者，對於父母而言，此亦欲矯正人類重權利輕義務之劣性也。凡人自孕育哺養提携療護敎育，乃至婚嫁，皆由父母之力，及長成能自立，每易忘其昔日所受享之恩惠，一如社會上借錢者，當時百般哀求，得之則千聲萬謝，迨至索還時，雖己富有，每圖賴債，多至涉訟，又如作官者，只顧得錢，不圖稱職，同一心理也。古之哲人，察知人類同有之弱點，以爲社會秩序，不能恃法律維持，必須自幼養成人人之責任心，使知受享者，必應有所報答也，故特别奬勸孝道，懲戒不孝，國家制爲法律，社會形爲淸議，而其效亦甚顯明，古諺有之，「求忠臣必於孝子之門，一考諸歷史，未有能孝之人，而爲貪官汚吏者，未有能孝其親而爲害於人羣者，何也？彼己有充分之責任心，輕視權利而重視義務，故能臨財不苟得，臨難不苟避也，今人欲打到孝道者，殆未深思全體利害耳。節義者，對於夫婦而言，亦培成責任心之要事也。大抵訂婚之時，山盟海誓，各以白首相期，此等甜蜜之言語，係欲爲一時戀愛引誘之工具乎？</p>
<p>亦將有實際履行之意思耶？若志在履行，而竟能實踐其然諾，方足爲責任心之表示，今之人，動輒中道分離，别有戀愛，大抵或因别遇較健美之男女，或者利其資財勢位，而一切誓約，悍然置之不顧，甚則並子女而亦棄之，此等亡失責任心之行爲，今日最爲普通，以如此之人民，欲共國而忘身公而忘私，不亦難乎？近人頗有唱打倒貞操之說者，美其名曰解放婦女。吾則以爲打倒貞操，最不利於婦女者也，何則，自由戀愛理論雖多，實際上男子多以性慾美色爲前提，女子易爲感情所蒙蔽，有理智之選擇者甚少，女子所恃者，十數年短期間顔色而已，過此時期，卽易爲男子所厭，舊社會如此，新社會亦如此，况女子因孕育之故，易得疾病，及其被棄，顔色已衰，難於别嫁，男子則不然，衰老較遲，肉慾較盛，旣無孕育之累，謀生活動力亦較强，故常處優越之地位，吾所見社會中女子受此屈抑者多矣，昔日有貞操之說，表面上誠爲片面，實際上女子較得相當之保護，男子縱納妾而公然棄婦不顧者，社會中尚不多見，女子固多守貞，男子爲妻守義者，亦不乏人，蓋爲良心所驅使故耳，自古通人，亦從不主張勸靑年孀婦守節，且舊日奬勸貞操，初無法律强制，惟對於持守之精神，加以褒揚而已，其奬勸雖僅在婦女，而影響實及於全社會，今則此種精神久已消滅，尚有何物待打倒乎，况我國民性質，近來日流於輕率浮淺，不能遠慮，而易健忘，五分鐘愛國熱忱，爲世所笑，官吏信誓旦旦，少有能守多數人志意力之薄弱，不可諱言，今圖挽救，非空言所能有效，必須從優生遺傳改善，培養一般靑年男女，以嚴重肅穆之風，必有强毅貞固之父母，尤其母性，然後能誕生心理健全之子女，一再傳而後，庶幾有多數偉大人格之國民，以收拾此破碎腐爛之時局也，敎育家及負指導社會之責者，幸毌忘焉。</p>
<p>常人所稱爲忠孝節義，今日久已視爲迂論不層掛齒，然細加分析，關係於責任心之養成，如此其鉅，古人所爲提倡表率，良非迂也。日前小兒聞黃任之先生談及日本近事，謂彼國人責任精神，眞不可及，彼何以能至此哉？蓋由提倡奬進之力也乃木大將戰勝强俄，全國尊爲軍神者也，乃於明治帝之死，殺以殉其君，其妻亦以七十之高年自殺以殉其夫，自今人觀之，似無竟義，然其影響於軍國民之訓育，及社會之風紀者，甚巨，今東京有乃木神社，過其門者，無不鞠躬致敬，使人聯想以身殉國以身殉夫與戰勝强俄爲一事，則其責任心與爲國犧牲之心自然而生矣。彼能發揚舊有道德則愛國之精神如彼，我國人打倒一切禮敎，而腐化之現狀如此，可不深長思乎？以上所述，如能實行，則不僅國貨得以提倡，而一切國事，皆有改良之望，鄙人願與諸君共相勉勵切磋，以期有補於萬一耳。</p>
<h3>怎樣纔是一個十分美滿的家庭</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>咦！本刋是『國貨週刋』，不是研究婦女與家庭的刋物。爲什麽，區區却要在本刋上提出這麽一個問題｜｜怎樣纔是一個十分美滿的家庭？｜｜呢？我想：諸君在看見這個題目，未讀到正文之先，也許要有這樣的懐疑，和這樣的稀奇吧？其實說穿了，用不着懷疑，嘸没啥稀奇。</p>
<p>因爲，天地間芸芸衆生，除非是抱獨身主義的『和尚』，誰不需要家庭？尤其是美滿的家庭，爲人人所羨慕的。那麽，『怎樣纔是一個十分美滿的家庭？』，這個問題，是很廣大的了，自然，爲大家所急要知道的。而且在這『婦女國貨年』，更爲大家所應該明瞭的一件事情。區區現在所說的問題，就是涉及國貨的，所以便在本刋上來談談。</p>
<p>我們知道，一般人對於『美滿家庭』的心理，一言以蔽之，不外乎『幸福』兩個字。但是，我覺得在這個年頭上，家庭光是『幸福』，還不能說是『十分美滿的家庭，』只可說是『九分美滿的家庭。』還有『一分的美滿，』你該明白，就是每天不論是着的；吃的；用的；樣樣都採取『國貨』。在家庭裏找不出一點點的『洋貨』來，那你的家庭纔是一個『十分美滿的家庭』哩！否則，就是『美中不足』了！還談得到『十分美滿』嗎？</p>

<h3>雜談禮敎</h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>漢高祖旣登大位，因爲羣臣放肆，便覺得坐龍廷的滋味未必比住凉亭好；等到叙孫通把朝儀一定，才恍然於做黃帝的高貴，而感到禮敎的需要。</p>
<p>其實需要禮敎的，除非身是皇帝。倡導禮敎的人，常是只替爲帝爲王者設想。每每讓大衆戴上鐐銬，使人與人之間隔着高牆，而僅僅給予少許野心家以特權。如果有人擺脫了鐐銬，爬過高牆，甚而至於使野心家的特權發生動摇，那就是背叛禮敎，成爲「亂臣賊子」，「人人得而誅之」了。</p>
<p>然而這也並不是甚麽不易的定律。</p>
<p>「亂臣賊子」如果能够做到帝王，倡導禮敎的先生們也就立刻背着禮敎的招牌光臨了。這回自然也還是替爲帝爲王者設想。亂臣賊子一坐龍廷，不免就生野心，鐐銬旣鎖不着自己，而况還有許多好處，落得做個人情。所以幾千年來，諸子百家，被斥爲邪說異端，散佚殆盡，而孔二先生却能够巍然獨存。</p>
<p>孔二先生的巍然獨存，也便是禮敎的不落伍。何况讀書人還要拿來當作看家本領，努力宣傳。於是男人制服女人，禮也；主子壓迫奴才，禮也；上司驅策下官，禮也；至於帝王治國，當然更非禮敎不可。這見解越來越深，就弄到雖非「亂臣賊子」，但「君要臣死」，也就「不得不死」了。</p>
<p>這上面便產生了「莫須有」。</p>
<p>但其結果更慘的，却要算死守雎陽城這一幕了。據唐書忠義傳載：張巡守雎陽城，君子奇攻圍旣久，城中糧盡，易子而食，拆骸而爨。巡乃出其妾，對三軍殺之，以饗軍士；曰「請公等爲國家戮力守城，一心無二。巡不能自割肌膚之以啖將士，豈可惜此婦人！」將士皆泣下，不忍食。巡强令食之。括城中婦女旣盡，以男夫老小繼之，所食人口二三萬」</p>
<p>這回是弄到夫要妻死，官要民死，也都不得不死了。因爲要保全自己對主子的一些忠心，去完成禮敎，便不惜犧牲無辜。所謂禮敎也者在這裏才現出了它的眞面目：原來是吃人的惡魔！</p>
<h3>爲「批評家」辯</h3>
<p>— 埜容</p>
<p>「批評家」近來似乎成了衆矢之敵，倘使是指摘短處呢，犯了「摧殘」罪，據說「殺錯了人」。然而對作品一加讚許，又犯了「神經過敏」罪，使文壇「喜氣洋溢」，無助於文化的發展。前者已經有人視爲「暴徒」，據說將被「窒息了的作家」踢入「冷宮」，受點幽禁之苦。後者也有不少的人在口誅筆伐。</p>
<p>這反響，一方面是來自「作家之羣」，說是被「批評」窒息了他們的創作。一方面倒似乎不是作家，只是一些仗義之士，爲作家代抱不平的。看他們爲文化前途而悲憫作家的口氣，可知是站在旁邊的第三者。</p>
<p>批評家身臨於夾攻之中，似乎已瞠目結舌，自知罪孽深重，無辭可答。然而跳上戲台去把扮曹操的戲子一斧劈死的人，其實如今倒並不是批評家，而是那被扮演的眞曹操。如今的樵夫雖然也同在台下，但還不至分不出皂白，辯不明眞假。何况一個批評家的地位，與一個觀衆的樵夫的地位並不相同，何况樵夫要劈他一斧的是眞的曹操呢？</p>
<p>倘使是「殺錯了人」，那也只是出於「誤會」，並非與戲子有仇，是情有可原的。</p>
<p>一個眞正的批評家所要指出的是曹操的社會存在是否眞實，與扮演曹操的唱工和做工何如。倘如把曹操演成了岳飛，或岳飛演成了曹操，就劈他一斧也是該的。批評家的斧頭的方向是在這裏，而不是台上，更不是台上的戲子。</p>
<p>批評家並不怕曹操演得眞切，正痛恨戲子們不能眞切的把曹操演出於觀衆之前。痛恨那演曹操的是曹操們自己，要劈死戲子的也是曹操。因爲他演得太像他們自己。戲子們不要「錯認了仇人」。　　我雖不是批評家，但甚眞正的批評家呌屈。批評家並不會「殺錯了人」，倘如「誤會」，那也是執行那「斧鉞之誅」的個人的責任。所以「樵夫」終是樵夫，不是批評家。</p>
<h3>失眠</h3>
<p>— 周枌伽</p>
<p>近幾天來，幾乎夜夜都閙着失眠。</p>
<p>失眠，這並不是一種厲害的症候，然而在過着勞心生活的人，却是一種威脅也不知道這失眠症是怎樣發生的。照例，每天一到晚上十點鐘我便上了床；床上是裝着電燈開關的，只要一伸手，把燈捺熄，我就可以蘧遞然的進入夢中。在夢中，一切人類都是平等的，不論是擁貲千萬的富翁，或是筆路檻樓的小民。</p>
<p>可是，有一夜，情形却不同了。我照常熄了燈，向包圍在四周的黑暗投了最後的一瞥，便閉上眼皮，預備到黑甜鄉裏去尋我的好夢。不料眼皮雖已閉上，夢却老把我關在門外，彷彿一切都注定我要受一夜磨難似的，翻來覆去總是睡不着覺，腦海裏像開了特别快車，思潮奔騰澎湃的没有停歇的時候。</p>
<p>首先讚進我頭腦裏來的，便是文壇上的「京派」和「海派」的問題。於是「名士才情商業競賣」這八個大字，就很快的在我腦裏一閃。接着，又從文壇上的「京派」和「海派」，想到戲劇界的「京派」和「海派」，想到梅蘭芳的貴妃醉酒和小達子的狸貓換太子，想到粗聲怪氣的小達子演的戲，當然不如文學博士梅蘭芳演的戲佳妙，而「海派」之不如「京派」，也大槪是一定不移之論了。最後是覺得「京派」這兩個字有些不妥，應該改爲「平派」。因爲北京現已改稱北平，京劇也已改稱平劇，若文壇上人猶自居「京派」之名，難免不被人目爲有某種嫌疑這樣想着想着，思潮層出不窮，而夢境離開我也就愈趨愈遠了。</p>
<p>驀地睜開眼來，顯現在我眼前的是黑暗的一團。這黑暗使我苦惱，我不禁想起明天還有許多事要做，今夜無論如何一定要睡着覺，否則到明天，卽使勉强能做事，人也要疲倦得非凡，而一切預定的計劃不用說都完了。因此，我便努力强制着那些思潮，要把自己硬納進夢境中去。</p>
<p>「睡吧！一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八……」我默默的唸誦着這數目字。這是一個朋友敎導我的，據說有意想不到的效力，失眠的人只要一直唸誦下去，不到一百的數目，便會不知不覺的進入夢中。現在，我便照着實行了。可是到數近一千個還醒着時，就知道這方法也不中用，不得不另謀别法。别法是把手放在左邊乳下，並盡力想着自己的脚部，使頭腦　的血液下流，便容易睡着。這是我從某一本書上看來的。實行起來倒也並不困難。只是覺得想自己的脚部，未免太乏味，不如想自己的屁股，大槪也一樣能使頭腦裏的血液下流。於是，我便盡力把思潮集中到我的屁股上去。誰知這一來更壞了！我的念頭很快的從屁股轉到林語堂先生「論踢屁股」那篇文章，又從那篇文章轉到苦茶庵笑話選裏所提到的將頭比屁股爲戲的笑話，而睡夢也更不易臨到我身上。</p>
<p>天却就在我這努力想睡中間亮了起來。天亮了，我不得不起身做事。一做事，人就疲倦得要命，呵欠連連的，只想躺到床上去睡。好容易推到上了床，頭一靠着枕，我却又睡不着了。一切都只是昨夜的繼續，思潮依舊在奔騰澎湃，腦海裏依舊在開特别快車，而且更多了一種聲音：</p>
<p>「走快點！美利堅，走快點！」</p>
<p>這是一篇短篇小說的名字，作的人不訪得了，大槪是美國的果爾德。不知怎樣這時却儘連續不斷的在我頭腦裏響着。爲了要使這聲音消滅，我不得不另外用一種想念來代替。於是，我便想到了溥儀打做皇帝，想到了坐在皇位上的風味，想到了秦始皇，亞歷山大，拿破崙，威廉二世，希特勒，想到了第二次世界大戰。而我的頭腦裏，也就在這時發出了「轟」的一響，彷彿二次大戰的火藥庫已經燥炸了。</p>
<p>這樣，我又眼睜的看了一夜黑暗。一連幾夜在失眠中過去。疲倦，失望，苦惱，交襲到我衰弱的身上，我實在支持不住了。屢次想往藥房裏去買一瓶安神藥水來吃，却又每次都爲妻所阻止。妻的那懦怯的心，總怕我吃了安神藥水，會從此長眠不醒。但她那里知道，我正巴不得能够長眠。因爲一經長眠，我便可以不至於每夜每夜都面對着黑暗，不至於恐懼第二次世界大戰的到來，更不至於恐懼有一天會向和我差不多年齡的溥儀俯首稱臣了。</p>
<h3>評「妬誤」</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>最近商務印書館出版了黎烈文兄留法時翻譯的一部劇本「妬誤」。</p>
<p>關於道位法國戲劇家培兩　（）Ｊ·Ｊ·Ｂernard，我是一點知識都没有；只從他的「妬誤」這個劇本看來，我們可以看得出他是一個非常優秀的劇作家。</p>
<p>「妬誤」原名「　燃壞了的火」（Ｌe　Feu　pui　reprend　mal)；譯者因嫌原名累贅，改題「妬誤」。但我却以爲原名是更能表現出這劇本的意義，因爲我們不能只把這本書看做「研究嫉妬心的新的一頁」（批評家Ｒegis　Gignour的話），不管作者是有意或是無意，他在這劇本裏是提示了更多的問題。而這些問題是有關於前次的世界大戰。</p>
<p>劇情是非常的簡單，人物也只有四個，一對夫妻，老父及妻之女友；塲所是在法國的一個小城市裏，時間正在歐洲大戰之後。丈夫安得烈是一個中學敎員，在戰初旣成了俘虜，囚在達姆斯塔營中直有四年；同時他的妻勃朗施也就在苦痛中期待了四年，可是在最後的幾個有，　和那小城市中的家家户户一樣地，她在家裏收留下一個美國兵。關於這事，後來她自己對她的女友貞勒說：「市長先生是那樣懇請着。你很可相信否則我决不願意的。但市長先生對我說，在我們這樣小城内，一個敎員的女人應當給人家一個好榜樣。安得烈如果在家時，也一定會對我說這一樣的話的。因此我才接受了。」但就在休戰條件簽字後，父親妻子以及朋友熱烈的歡迎安得烈回家的那當天，他就對妻懷下了疑嫉。其次幾乎不藉任何具體的事實，表現了那丈夫的疑惑和妬嫉的心理的發展，四年來夢想着的夫婦重聚的生活的幸福，片刻都没有實現，而每天兩個人在爭吵着。這種冷酷的現實給與勃朗施的失望，是超過了她四年以來所忍受過來的一切的痛苦：</p>
<p>勃朗施（深思）……安得烈被俘·那時我有一種義務。他不在我身邊，他不幸，所以他能够競爭。但現在他回來了，而這已不是從前的安得烈。</p>
<p>貞勒，你太把你自己的失望看得重要了，你没有從前那般寬大。</p>
<p>勃朗施　也許如此；但是常生活却道樣無情！它把我們心愛的人所有的那種頂壞的地方顯給我們看……自從他回來後，安得烈在我的眼中只是一個普通人而已。</p>
<p>就是這無情的日常生活，逼迫着她要她離開她的丈夫，要她隨着那個曾經幾個月和她住在一個屋裏的美國兵走到一個新的世界去；這個美國兵雖然和她未曾發生過什麽關係，但在最後臨走的時候，曾對她表示了愛，而現在還和她通着信。雖然事實上她没有走，雖然在全劇的收尾，躺對着她那多疑妬嫉的丈夫這麽說：「啊，你呌我怎麽好走呢？」可是她的心是破碎了，她是嘗受着深刻的幻滅的痛苦，而她的未來的生活預定着是不幸的。（未完）</p>
<h3>父女（六）</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>她像是已經完全明白了父親心中的苦處，知道在父親的情况中這是一條自然該走的路。對父親的怨憤已經消下去，譴責也就變成了安慰。</p>
<p>「從此以後，孩子，我由心中答應你，｜｜再也不吏一滴酒近我的嘴唇！」他下了最大的决心，在說完這句話的時候，眼睛瞪得大大的。</p>
<p>「我知道您會這樣做，爲了您的女兒，爲了您自己。」</p>
<p>她說完了，便把臉仰着，偎依到他的臉上去。</p>
<p>天已經大亮了，秋晨的好陽光從窗帘的縫裏鑽進來，照在他們的身上，她扶起父親，緩緩地站起身來，走到窗前，拉開了窗帘，望到窗外的景物，眼前是堆滿了血一樣紅的楓葉，那樣艶麗，像是永遠也不會使人想到再過幾天就要落在地上爲人踐踏成灰塵的。在路上，已經舖滿了黃色的落葉，那也都是有過如翠玉一樣綠的好日子的；可是秋天結束了一切，都只能安然地躺在地上了。</p>
<p>他凝神地望着，像有着什麽深思似的，到後來微微點點頭，喃喃地說道：</p>
<p>「我該珍重自己，我該珍重自己！」</p>
<p>傍在身邊的女兒，聽到這樣的話便望他笑着，陽光照在他們的臉上有着異樣的光輝。　　這以後他們就更安順地過着日子，度過了秋天便是寒肅的冬日。可是他們的心却温暖着，父與女是相互地給着慰安。</p>
<p>一個晚間，父親到獨身者俱樂部去了，因爲那裏有一位知名之士的演講會。她一個人坐在起坐間裏爲父親織着一件毛絨衣，友人送來的一隻雪獅子貓在滾着那絨線球玩着。她頗感興趣地望着它，可是兩隻手仍然没有亭停止工作。這時候女僕進來和她說道：</p>
<p>「小姐，外面有一位女客來看老爺。」</p>
<p>「什麽，一位女客？」</p>
<p>她放下了手中的活計，帶着一點驚訝的神情問着。</p>
<p>「是，看起來像是有三十幾歲的樣子，一個人坐了汽車來的。」</p>
<p>「你没有告訴她老爺不在家麽？」</p>
<p>「她說也願意見小姐。」</p>
<p>「她知道我？」</p>
<p>「她像是知道。」</p>
<p>「那就請進來吧。」</p>
<p>她站起身，拍去身上的碎絨頭，用手指掠一掠頭髮；她心中起了大大的疑問。這麽多年，從來還没有過單身的女客來拜訪過父親的，這一位該是什麽樣的女人呢？那個女客已經隨着女僕走進來，突然像是有微弱的電流在她的身上巡行了一周，她疑惑着自己的眼睛，再睜大了些，她的心起始在打着抖。她想呌出些什麽來，但她立刻知道那是多麽不相宜，她就强自忍了下去。她看到那婦人也在注視着她，呆呆地，像是忘掉了自己。她看到那婦人有近五十的年紀了，可是有好身材，和應時的衣着，又憑着特長的打扮，看起來就容容易易地减去了十年或十五年的年齡。在眼角那裏，她分明地望到那顆紅痣。那女客也像是想突然地呌出什麽來，也是吞住了，只訥訥地說：</p>

<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈疲跌之象、洋麥報價、雖芝加哥回好二角外、均拿大好近角、不過業内外人心、並不因此振奮、以市塲傳政府借麥、又有兩船抛售、價爲四元二角、上海交貨、由大小各廠攤買、故市上人心已虛、廠家抛胃亦盛、市面均見低落、迨至下午開盤、遠期各月份、廠家仍陸續抛售、惟以買氣不振、賣量亦屬不多、至本月份因多空互　、出入無幾、結果本月份較前日小五厘、二月份跌二分二厘半、三四月份跌一人七厘半、五月份跌一分半、六月份跌一分二厘半、</p>
<h3>遠期新麥已破八角關</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、雖回好一角及二角外、惟本月份因交割已近、多頭急事回出、廠家均有洋麥進口、標凖似</p>
<p>無收意、故最後低至三元九角半、較前日又小三分、遠期交易仍不甚暢、上落有限、惟六月份已破八角關口、低至七角九分、後步如政府偕麥、陸續抛售、標麥當少希望云、</p>

<h3>南北貨苦杏仁貨缺奇俏</h3>

<h3>日用品商塲的槪述（四）溪南</h3>
<p>本來吾國的店家，夥友膳宿，由東家供給，所得薪俸，單供仰事俯畜之用　。自從「洋行制度」流行以來，這膳宿問題，發生變化，包括在薪水以内，不再供給。其後，吾國的銀行公司也是照樣辦理。因此在公司行家做事的朋友，吃飯遂發生問題，除了回家吃飯之外，少不得要上館子，可是兩者多費。省錢朋友，於是有的乾餱充飢，有的臨時呌飯。尤其是四川路東至浦灘一帶，都是洋行銀行大公司海關所在，一般職員，吃飯問題的解决，很覺得嚴重，可是天下事，如有需要，必有供給，爲消費而設立的臨時食堂，亦如雨後春笋。最著的如通商銀行旁邊進去的路上，居然「供帳道左」紅燒牛肉咖啡麵包吐司之類，應有盡有，到了星期日，亦與各行家同樣休息。外白渡橋以北，虹口楊樹浦一帶，碼頭居多，故祇有油條大餅之屬，專爲苦力果腹罷了。</p>
<p>沿浦，關於食的方面，尚有法租界十六舖的魚市塲，他們的交易，正大一般人高臥方酣天時破曉的時候，趕小菜塲的小販，都趁這時候，販運至各馬路去賣。所以魚鮝行也都彚集在</p>
<p>這處，靑蘿　乾，紫大頭，是他們附帶的營業。</p>
<p>十六舖又是水菓行的「發祥地」，東門路裏馬路一帶，有不少的水果行，可是南粤所產的香蕉糖庶，有一部分行家是說在吳淞路等處。買水菓，果然向行家去買爲便宜，但亦不盡然，如其會買的話，倒是小販手中會買着便宜貨。尤其行家的秤，小至莫明其妙，大約他們所謂一斤，還不及一磅。這一種情形，不但是水菓行家店家所不免，卽如號稱大的國貨商塲，一元的十斤橘子，一復秤，只有八十兩左右，「小」得更加不可想議了。（待續）</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市益爲不景氣</h3>
<p>（永亨絲廠又告停工）本埠絲廠業因海外絲銷仍無轉機、新年中勉强開工者祗南市寳泰順一·二兩廠、及閘北　蒼虹口永亨福繪等單雙言絲廠五家、詎歐美絲市仍趨疲滯、實銷不動、國内　門銷胃不暢、且須虧折、故各廠勢難支持、虹口天寳路永亨絲廠、（絲車二百零八部）前日又告停工、現計全市開工之絲廠、祗寳泰順等四家、其中恒蒼等兩家、尚係代客繅絲餘繭、　醫卽須停止工作云、</p>
<p>（黃白絲頭輸出益减）黃白絲頭出口日趨退化、上週輸出益减、各郵船祗裝往歐美各國計五百三十七担、其中印屬祗裝去一担、</p>
<p>（歐美絲銷難望轉機）横濱日絲市塲、現期絲價漲跌靡定、紐約標凖絲價仍趨盤旋、里昂英倫價無榮辱、各絲廠存絲足數需求、電報轉滬寥落、華　商手中存絲價小難售、市氣擯持、絲銷一時難望轉機、昨祗内地各綢廠進白廠經四十包、償仍堅挺、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>紳士們幹的玩意兒</h3>
<p>— 雲菲</p>
<p>上海奶奶太太小姐發起之國貨展覽會，有一展覽室曰「模範家庭」，所謂模範家庭也者，係是一間華麗堂皇的會客室與臥室合併的家庭，在該室裏的一切傢具，看看標價，須要一千元。</p>
<p>的確，現在有許多事體，名目上是爲社會大衆設想，而其實質，却不過是紳士幹的玩意兒。譬如上舉的例罷，他的名目是國貨展覽會，而其宣傳目標則爲「模範家庭」，照常理而論，這「國貨」應該是人人能用的國貨，而這模範家庭，也至少是要人人能够「模範」的「家庭」，然而事實上所謂模範家庭，便要一個</p>
<p>一千元的傢具」｜世界事就常是如是滑稽，名目儘管說得好聽，而實際總不過是一套騙人的玩意兒｜</p>
<p>社會上類此的事眞多着呢，譬如說是講衛生罷，一班人總是呌人家要營養適當，每天早上最好吃杯牛奶，多運動，分工作過度，星期日最好到公園裏去走走，這樣身體才會强健起來。有了病，要立刻請醫生看，切勿聽信女巫道士們的胡言，送鬼吃仙方，這是要送命的。這些話聽去何嘗不是。而其實他們平日連大餅還是勉强吃得兩個，吃點白飯靑菜已甚困難，不要說什麽牛奶之類。工作麽，是牛馬式的。運動休息，在他們是根本談不到。生了病罷，醫生｜無論是西醫中醫，都是可望而不可卽的，不去請女巫道士請誰呢？他們所需要的報酬，横豎不過是那麽幾個角子或幾百錢，這才眞合得他們的脾胃呢。並如講敎育罷，一般人總常時閙着要敎育普及，要使鄉村兒童都能識字，於是儘量在鄉村推廣學校，又恐農民無力負擔子弟們的學費，不肯送子弟們來上學，於是又間或有幾所義務小學的設置，一切學費書籍，都由學校供給，學生只須化些時間來讀讀好了，這樣對於農民可算仁至義盡，普及敎育，不成問題了。而其實還儘有大批的農民，他們連放一個小孩子來讀義務書也不肯的。因爲他們有一個小孩子就要作一個人的用塲，田忙了，要小孩子帮忙，空了，也要小孩子樵柴或放牛，這也抵得半個工人的作用呢，要他們子弟來讀書，就等於搶去他半個工人。他明知識字的好處，然而寗願子弟不識字，不願平白丢掉半個工人的。這樣結果義務學校是義務學校，農民還是農民，普及敎育，問題還是解决不了。其他社會上事和這相同者隨處皆是，一般人總只從上面着想，而不肯從下面根本上着想，所以結果無一不是落了空的。其實目前社會上最需要的，倒不是什麽衛生敎育等等好名詞，而是最起碼最起碼的「吃飯」問題。吃飯問題解决了，才能再談共他。目前他們是飯也没有吃，那裏還有聞心思去講到吃飯外的事情？然而，怎樣使他們有飯吃呢？社會上一般高等人是不去想的。他們只會站在高處唱高調，說風凉話。</p>
<p>記得從前有一年法國大饑，餓死的人很多，法公主道，救饑最易，何至餓死，這雖是民間傳說，未必可靠，然而由此亦可見富人不知窮人的苦，其間相隔，實有出乎意外的。目前一班太太小姐老爺們所講究的社會事業，大槪</p>
<p>也是屬於呂蒙正一指寒病之類了。</p>
<p>某要人曾經說過這樣一句話，他說，現在我們樣學美國，這是錯誤的，美國是富人，我們是窮人，我們只有窮做，要學美國，結果是一樣都弄不好的。這幾句話很有意思。我現在也要套他的話來說，我們現在所最急需解决的是大家的吃飯問題，而不是諸位大人先生們口中的社會事業｜你們眞的有意思來辦社會事業麽，那末就請你先從這方面下手罷，紳士們管的玩兒，現在我們是根本不需要喲｜</p>
<h3>文人的三行</h3>
<p>— 美</p>
<p>「文章自己好」，這是中國人最普通的諺語。這諺語是十足地顯露着中國文人的自驕自大。本來，中國有遼闊的土地，雄壯的山河，同時在四萬萬人中識字者｜這是指非文盲，而非文人｜據去年的統計，只有百分之十，由此看來，則文人之自驕自大實爲自然環境與社會環境所促成，非文人本身之過也。</p>
<p>文人的自驕自大也不一定是基於其「一字値千金」的心理。若因文人知道寫幾個字就應該自驕自大，則上海南京的文丐跪伏在馬路旁以粉筆寫出大篇的自述，供諸多「過往君子」的欣賞，何以所得的代價，不過銅元數十枚，而不堪一飽呢？由此可知文人的自驕自大乃别有道理了。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>文人的自驕自大是在三行，何謂三行，卽「我行，你不行，他也不行」是也。這裏均所謂「行」，並不是行走的意義，而是「好」的隠語。所謂「我行的你不行，你不行，他也不行」也者，似乎是說「我的作品好，你的不好，他的也不好」或「我能作好的文章，你不能，他也不能。」在下少小讀書，由是亦忝在文人之列，常與文人游，文人見我書架上所陳列之書籍，忽而指着某書曰「不行」，忽又指着他書曰「亦不行」，言語之間，似乎只有他自己才「行」：現在的一般批評家，又何嘗不然。人家的文章，落在他的筆下，没有一篇是「行」的，言語之間，似乎只有他自己的文章才「行」。一個文人都抱着三行中的「我行」主義，於是乎中國的文人都「行」起來了！　　凡文人都學過修詞學，故其造句能恰到妙處。文人雖抱着「我行」主義，但决不以「我行」宣佈於衆，其所宣佈於衆者是「你不行」或「他也不行」，蓋「你不行」「他也不行」，等於「我行」；這與代數中的Ａ方乘Ｂ方等於Ｃ方一個樣子。但一旦「我行」主義的某文人幸而被人重視，則吾輩「不行」之文人均熱望某文人偉大作品之出現，不料某文人之偉大作品在許多批評家的筆下又在「不行」之列，於是另一「我行」主義之某文人又繼之而起，彼倒此立，結果個個都是「天才家」，也個個都是「低能兒一，至今我們在這三行之中，找不出一個眞正的「我行」作家。</p>
<p>這就是近幾年來中國文壇的大轉變，也就是近幾年來中國文壇的怪現象。</p>
<h3>等候</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>下雪了，幾地暖熱後，終於在今天下雪了。一片片飄飄的雪花，從天空中掉下來，落在我篷鬆的亂髮，和大衣的皮領上，陣陣的西北風直向我的臉上吼過來，我祗有把頭向大衣領裏鑽，兩隻凍得紅腫的手縮在袖管裏；十分鐘一次的擺渡輪船，不知開過了幾多艘，可是我忍耐地等候着，在加勁地吹着的西北風中等候着我的她，像小鳥一般的那人兒。</p>
<p>「今天是星期日，她學校是有一天尩假，並且我剛才打電話去問她，聽筒裏像鶯囀的聲音中，明明聽見她說過一會兒就來。怎麽老是這樣的要我等着不來呢？」我心裏這樣的想。</p>
<p>一大批的人，又從這小小的渡船裏流出來。這一葉小舟喘着氣慢慢地又把另外的一羣帶走了。我孤單單的我，還是站在碼頭上，這時呈現在我眼前，更是妻凉寒愴！我抖索索地覺得心靈都有些寒冷了，看見黃浦裏滾滾的浪濤，給大輪船經過時汹湧地奔騰着，港裏水面上也起了不靜的浪花，我懼怕了，我疑心這大浪會將我捲入那深淵的漩渦裏去。　　一分鐘二秒鐘這樣的過去，我注視着表，它告訴我是十二時了，我默然屈指計算着，我站在這兒足足已等候了三個鐘頭了。</p>
<p>一輛黃包車遠處飛行而來，我努力地望着，車上果然是個女郎，我疑心是她，可是車子到了我面前時，又給車夫的兩條健腿没命地帶過去了。我開始在咒詛這車夫太無情太殘酷了，爲什麽不把我的地帶了來呢？雖是這樣，然而我並没有失望。</p>
<p>「出了什亂子，不來了？祷不太意外嗎？……」我簡直不敢這麽的想，我希望我所想的是神經過敏的。</p>
<p>踱·踱，踱的一陣皮鞋聲，從我的後面走近來。我相信這是我的她，然而我還是不敢回頭，恐怕這又會使我失望的。</p>
<p>時間又過了三十分了，我實在有些等得不耐煩了，於是我逆風地走到Bu's　Stou　的標記前　　因爲她必定乘×路以共汽車來的。忍耐地等候着，不一會，眞的一輛公共汽車載着擁擁擠擠一車的乘客，望進去黑黝黝地砌滿了人頭，於是我拉長了頭頸，抖擻着精神，望着這汽車門裏吐出來的乘客，呵！那裏有她呢？何處找得出她的影兒來呢？車子接二連三的來了。四輛，五輛，結果，啊，我深深地掉在失望的慘境中。</p>
<p>我下意識地又慢步渡向碼頭上去了。一路上頭給風吹着，痛得裂開來了，四肢凍得僵硬，下半身分外的酥軟，幾乎要攤下去了。江面上跟着浪濤來的怪風，我把一小時來保持着的熱烈的心胸。趕得成了氷氷的了。呵！她敷衍我，辜負了我。於是我毅然忍痛地買了票走下了渡船，我凝視着江心，凝視着這淘天的浪花，我隨舟漂泊在這茫茫的江中，自己悵悵的心境，差不多空虛到了萬分！</p>
<p>呵！她呀！小鳥般地那人兒哪，那兒去了呢？</p>
<h3>新嫁娘</h3>
<p>— 欲歸</p>
<p>壁爐中的火燄融融地從火門口冲出來，室内自然温暖的使人不復記憶現在是路有凍死骨的大雪寒天。然而我們的曼麗小姐，她坐在壁爐旁的心郤没有跟着和暖起來，冷冷的像雪花。她沉默着，將間已在午夜，其實要算第二天的早上了。</p>
<p>房中的燈光是那樣輝皇，牠照着一切的家具，新的銅床，新的璧飾更有那新的結婚照。如其曼麗小姐的頭能略略抬起，我們不難從結婚照上可以猜測她是一個新嫁娘了。</p>
<p>說起曼麗小姐的大名，在每個年靑人的腦經上是佔據着很多的地位的。她是女校的皇后，她是安琪兒一般的天仙。對於結婚這類事，我們的曼麗小姐也做過許多處女的美夢，她拒絶過每個年靑人的殷勤，她認是自己是在天空中飛翔的乳燕，不是可以關在金絲龍中的百靈。她的理想中的配偶還在她的美夢之中，然而｜她做了新嫁娘了。</p>
<p>窗外的雪片像鵝毛似的飄，曼麗小姐的心也像鉛似的沉。她仰起頭來，目光從結婚照上瞥過，她不信穿着大禮服，站在她身旁的那個漢子竟會自己終身的金絲籠。於是一切年靑男子的頭在她面前掃過，她的處女的美夢是完全打破了。她怨恨自己太没有勇氣，她可以隨便擇一個獻殷勤的靑年男子逃去她媽的手掌，無論結果如何，自己反正是生定了的被賣品。賣給你，賣給他，到賣完自己的肉體爲止。然而｜她是那漢子的法律上的妻子了。</p>
<p>曼麗將自己的頭一陣亂摇，她以爲可以將雜亂的思潮抛棄的，但是許多年靑男子的頭更形踴躍的在她面前掃過，她就像發狂似的跳起來投身到床上去。她雙手掩着自己的臉，兩條腿在床沿摇蕩，她没有哭，她不能哭了。突然鐘聲打了五下，像鐵錘一般的擊着她的心。</p>
<p>「啊，不回來了」！她像向面前掃過煌年靑男子們訴苦。</p>
<p>坐起身來挺勁的大笑一聲，自然曼麗小姐這時候想不到什麽値得大笑的事件，一如新寡的釐嫠婦在夜深人靜時放聲一哭的舒舒胸中的怨氣。眞的，大笑一聲之後，她認淸自己在那張新的銅床上，掛着美麗的纓絡的新床，喪失她處女的美夢的新床，也是自己終身的命運被判决了的新床。</p>
<p>曼麗小姐一時不信自己會從沙發上搬到床上來的，於是她再大笑起來，她舉起握緊的拳頭在空中努力揮動。</p>
<p>「我脫離這金絲籠」｜那聲音像什麽會義上的喊口號一般的宏大，曼麗小姐已像一頭荒山中的猛　她舞張着爪牙，尋覓那穿大禮服的漢子。但是房中除了璧爐中的火燄融融地從火門口冲出來，她没有對象來供自己的快意。</p>
<p>她迅速的蹤身上椅，舉起那結婚照像向璧爐中投去。她大聲笑着，拍着手，一如殺了那穿大禮服的漢子一般。</p>
<p>她勝利了，她需要休息，她倒身到銅床上。一時無千數年靑男子的頭奔聚攏來，曼麗小姐望了望美麗的纓絡，她又坐起身來了，她要投身到他們的懷中去，她已冲破了金絲籠的虎口她猛的向前撲去…。</p>
<p>「這時候就睡熟了」！一個粗大的聲音手溜彈似的震破她的耳糢。</p>
<p>睜開眼來，穿大禮服的漢子綳緊着臉駡人。</p>
<p>兩顆淸淚從曼麗小姐的眼眶中掛下來，她注視着那張結婚照。「你是新嫁娘啊」！無數年靑男子的頭向她嘲笑。</p>
<h3>小小遊藝會</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>初中裏的學生，近八日來什麽都在忙中過着，原來是因爲星期六他們要開一個小小的遊藝會。所以他們在忙着印入塲券，他又在忙着寫通告，那幾個在練戲，這幾個又在扎紅綠紙花，幹這樣，做那樣，東跑西穿，忙得個不亦樂乎！他們的念頭都會集在這個將要在星期六晚上開幕的小小遊藝會上。</p>
<p>原因是因爲上星期六五年級也曾開過這麽一個小小的遊藝會，因此初中部裏的學生，不認示弱地也來幹了這麽一套玩意兒，他們懷念着：難道我們堂堂的中學生，豈會不値這些高小部裏的學生嗎？所以我們便可斷定他們這次遊藝會組織的動機和起緣是要顯一顯他們中學生的顔色而與高小部裏競爭雄心，雖然他們公佈着的唯一宗旨是爲着學業上的切磋和羣體生活的養成。</p>
<p>『看見人們有了長處，自己就應當迎頭趕上去學，切不可以生妒忌心，而競爭心是應該有的。』這是我入了學校，就聽見敎師們常常這樣對我說的，現在自己處了當敎師的地位，也同樣對學生這樣說着。</p>
<p>五年級開遊藝會的日期離今天也不過五六日之多，所以對於當日的情形，我還能够明晰地記着：</p>
<p>自己担任了五年級的級任，由五年級同學的要求終於爲他籌劃了一切而能在上星期開始舉行了一個僅具雛形的極小的遊藝會，除了附和了學生的意思而不使他們過分掃興外，唯一的宗旨是給他們多知道些普通的常識和會議上的情形，因爲這裏大多是工人子弟，對於一切方面都感到欠缺。借了幕布舞衣，搭了一個小小的臺，照例請了各級代表若干人（其實各級的人數是超過代表人數以上的）。到了時刻就振鈴開會，一間小小的敎室里祇看見漆黑的人頭，大家　　着　把　小小的教弄得水　不通。照例是行過儀式然後節目開始表演，在開始表演的時候，除了初級的小孩子，凸出了眼睛，眼望着臺上津津有味的看着外；其餘的當一幕演完後就怪聲的呌好起來，有的還鼻頭裏冷笑着帶了譏諷的口吻。於是房子裏就閙得不肯休止　　這樣呌人頭疼的事情才過去不到一星期，初中的學生也來忙着要玩這一套，他們的結果，怕還不是一樣嗎？</p>
<h3>兩種人的請假</h3>
<p>— 何處去</p>
<p>坐在課堂裏坐久了，屁股便禁不住脹痛看，看着書本看久了，頭腦也禁不住昏起來，於是漫然地想到外面走一遭，順道看看這，看看那，藉以疏散疏散，而調劑着書齋生活的事情，要也是順乎人情而自然得很的罷？</p>
<p>然而學校的規條却顯然是不顧及這些的。什麽學生不得無故缺課呀，缺了課便没有學分呀，没有學分便畢不了業呀，種種種種都是限制學生離開學校的。於是而學生們請着假出外去逛一趟的事也是當然的罷？</p>
<p>請着假出去應當是有事的。然而坐久了屁股痛庆一類的事，却偏難得人家承認起來。於是而不得已的誑謊着說是病了呀，說是家裏有了事呀，如是如是而製着那請假條子去悠哉遊哉的却也是情不自己的。</p>
<p>誑謊着去悠哉遊哉的事本是干禁的。然而好在這是爲了自己的健康。因爲屁股脹痛了難免不會潰爛的，腦經昏多了難免不生腦膜炎。得着這樣的災難的時候，人家頂多是說一聲可敬呀，難得的很呀之類的惋惜話，然而自己却是白白地葬送了。想着想着，這够是多麽不智的事情。</p>
<p>所以說爲着健康請着假去疏散疏散的人總是懂得養生之道而曉得爲自己打算的。</p>
<p>坐在朝堂裏把國人的事當做是自己的事而思考着憂慮着的政治家們，有時候也常是發生這類的健康的問題的。</p>
<p>政治家們發生健康的問題是普普通通的，常常慣慣的，並且是一點都用不着驚疑的。爲甚麽呢？因爲政治家也是人，而人是常常會病的。</p>
<p>一般的人總認爲偉人便是超人似地。其實偉人也祇是打算方面超然於人，手腕方面超然於人，至於生理方面也是常人一股的。</p>
<p>要是常人一般的，便會發生常人一樣的健康問題。更何况爲着國人打算是那麽操勞的，爲着國人做事是那麽够苦的。操勞得够了惟苦着够了，你怕還不會病了？</p>
<p>於是政治家們爲着自己的健康問題而不惜忍痛地離開朝堂，也請着假養着病的事情，要也是順乎人情之至罷。</p>
<p>爲着自己的健康不惜請假治養的，這總是　得人生眞　的人。在常人　　我們，去效法效法，敬仰敬仰，佩服佩服，也是應該地罷。</p>

<h3>新兒</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>「新兒，爹爹回來了，趕快起來呀！」怪頑皮的六歲大的新兒，爲了早餐没有吃得飽，扔在地上哭了半天了，娘逗他，他不理，駡他打他，他也不怕。獨獨這麽一喊，他便連忙翻爬起來，渾身是灰的猛撲在娘懷裏，呌着黃鶯兒啼似的童聲：</p>
<p>「娘，爹爹回來了，去接呀！」新兒性急得跳將起來，拉着娘的衣袖硬要到門外頭去接爹爹。</p>
<p>這是新兒的第三次希望了。</p>
<p>第一次是在新年，他對娘說，今年滿六歲了，要做一套新衣，娘給他煩擾不過，只得順口答應了：「到了三月，收好棉花，一定給你做！」新兒也就存着希望，天天到田裏去看棉花，有一二枝結了苞，他就忙奔忙呌的跑回家報告娘，提出製新衣的成議。後來天公老是霏着毛毛雨，新兒有十來天没去看棉苗了，却聽得爹爹總是向娘使氣：「背時，這樣的霪雨，棉花都萎縮了！」果然十畝地的棉田，收不到兩三担死黃花，娘揀着，新兒還在跟前閙着製新衣，娘惱不過，給他響了兩個耳光，這才扔倒地上哭去了。</p>
<p>過了兩天，新兒趁着娘要他種牛痘的好機會，便又提出做新衣的條件來，娘劃算着，最近是全無出息，連柴米都日了不住日，只靠五月新麥出世，於是也就肯定的對新兒說：「你種好牛痘，五月收了麥，定呌爹爹給你去買布來做。」新兒首先有點不大相信，摇摇頭，彷彿大人一樣的說着不不，第三個還是不，「不不不，怎樣？」娘火透了，睜着圓眼對他這樣睹着，「不要，現在做！」「乖乖，現在没有錢啦，五月一定給你做！」新兒終給慈祥的娘說服了，「到了五月一定要做！」「一定給你做！」新兒也就肯種了牛痘。</p>
<p>新兒望着，望着，五月到了，天公得巧，風調雨順，黃色的麥穗結實的在風浪裏擺盪，新兒眞喜的狂了。</p>
<p>麥子一担一担的由爹爹的肩脖挑上塲來，新兒坐着矮凳防守鷄鴨來抓食，麥打好了，堆着像一面鍋形的小山，爹爹就到城裏去呌人來買，麥買去了，雪白的洋錢在爹爹的掌中翻覆，新兒就想起了做新衣，在娘跟前扭來扭去，爹爹的嘴對着娘在咭裏咕嚕：「唉，麥價這樣賤，這點錢還債都還不淸呀！」爹爹怒了，手掌應聲的落在新兒的面上，於是新兒又哭倒了。</p>
<p>到了七月，新兒又有了做新衣的願望，娘帶着悲苦的心對他說：「爹爹到城裏探聽榖價去了，這番，若是十二擔新榖全賣掉了，一定給你做一套！」新兒也就窩心希望着。</p>
<p>爲了一頓早餐没有吃飽，新兒扔在地上哭了半天了，怎樣也逗不動他起身。　　「新兒，爹爹回來了，趕快起來呀！」這才使得新兒連忙爬將起來。</p>

<h3>怎樣解除由家長訂定的婚約？</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>敝人童年時由家長作主，與乙女訂立婚約，初我亦極力抗議，但總因能力不足，只得聽從家長包辦。直至民十七年敝人年長稍有知識，對於此婚事屢向家長提出抗議，家長置之不理，但又過一年後，乙家不幸忽遭横逆，其家長均逃匿避禍。乙女無人照顧，故敝家長卽將乙女帶來，暫時代養，此事敝人雖屢次反對，總不見效。敝家長代養乙女至今，亦知乙女性情不良，故對敝人倒表同情，惟乙家長於民二十年返家，而乙女則仍留養我家，並始終反對解約，今敝家長雖對敝人表同情，但不知解約手續，一切責任還在我的身上，可是我又是没有能力的，所以只好請你們指導和答復以下的問題一</p>
<p>甲，敝人能否以以下三點作爲解約的理由！</p>
<p>一，係家長作主所訂之婚約，未經當事人之同意，</p>
<p>二，乙女係舊式女子，並不識字，且性情與敝人不合，</p>
<p>三，根據現在的結婚自由，退婚自由，婚姻自由的口號，</p>
<p>乙，倘敝人不與乙女結婚，而又與丙女自由宣告同居，是否是重婚，</p>
<p>丙倘不得解約而敝人登報申明不承認家長所訂之婚約，是否有效，</p>
<p>丁，倘敝人登報申明不承認由家長作主所訂之婚約，假如這種辦法有効，敝家長應負什麽責任？</p>
<p>戊，倘不得解約而二人均至二十歲以上，而敝人永不願與乙女結婚，如是，是否要受法律制止。</p>
<p>上面的幾個問題，均請</p>
<p>先生給我一個圓滿的答復和指導吧，完了，敬祝鐸安　江一凡上</p>
<p>編者按；照現行民法所規定，「婚約應由當事人自行訂定」，換句話說，如婚約非由男女當事人自行訂定者，應屬無效。所以你解約理由第一項，是可以成立，第二第三兩項則不成立，但有了第一項理由也儘够了，第二第三兩項理由是無庸提出的。解除婚約須由「訴請」，你但登報聲明，恐與手續不合。至於來函乙項所謂「與丙女自由宣告同居」則非法律所允許，因何對於以前婚約在未解除之前，這種行爲是不合法的。你解除婚約之後，你家長要負什麽責任，則照二十年上字一三七七號解除婚約及返還聘物涉訟判决要旨上講，是「父母本於舊律之主婚權作用，爲其幼小子女訂立婚約，依婚姻自由之原則，其子女之一造，如成年後，不願履行該婚約者，固得訴請解除，而在締約當事人。究不容其無故翻異」所以你家長如不具備民法所規定解約條件，是不能無故解約的。但是「婚約不得請求强迫履行」，亦爲法律所明定，如果硬要解約，並非是不可能，不過他方有「損害賠償之請求權」罷了。戊項辦法，法律上亦無特别規定，不過容許他方得解除婚約，並請求損害賠償而已。</p>
<p>總之，這種事件，是應由法律解决的，所以一切詳細進行手續，你須請敎律師。</p>

<h3>曼麗的自由（六）</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>你不用爭辯，你以爲你從家庭逃婚出來，這就是革命的前進的人物嗎？自從五四運動以後，男的女的從家庭逃婚出來的人不知有多少。那不過是初期的社會運動中的家庭革命的陳跡，算不了什麽偉大的行動和光榮的歷史喲。五四運動以後，從家庭革命出來的女靑年，到了現在是有三種不同的境遇和思想觀念的人。有一種人是奮鬭前進的結果，現在做了賢妻良母地在自己的小家庭裏頭屈服着了。有一種人是當時呼吸着新思想跑上革命之路，到了現在如果不是死亡就是消沉悲觀地盡情的享樂，對於家庭固然厭惡，對於人生也是虛無，｜｜這種人在過着慢性自殺的生活。還有一種人當時抱着經濟獨立生活獨立的志願，學醫科產科的最多，其次就是敎書，到了現在當了醫生或敎員，生活固然獨立，年華已隨流水去，老處女一向，其痛苦祗有自己曉得。</p>
<p>你是五卅運動那時代覺醒過來的靑年，可是你祇有單純的頭腦，因此你從家庭革命出來以後，單純地爲自己的前途而奮鬭；因此你不了解政治思想你厭惡政治；因此你不了解人傑的因政治思想而發生的苦惱；因此你在憂愁不安，你不能够和他生活下去而離開了他。</p>
<p>曼麗，這是你的錯啊！</p>
<p>現在你離開他了，難道一點後悔都没有嗎？難道一點痛苦都不覺得嗎？「不，不，我的身體雖然離開了他；我的心兒還是在想念着他，我的靈魂常常是飛找他喲！」你一定要這樣的告訴我。你一定更加埋葬在憂愁不安的濃霧裏頭呵！</p>
<p>曼麗，那未，你應該想一想你自己的過失：你爲什麽不求了解他呢？</p>
<p>你現在明白了麽？你不了解他的唯一原因，就是你的思想落伍了！</p>
<p>還有，你祗看見你自己，除了你自己以外，連你的愛人都看不見。這自然是你的特殊，你的驕傲，但也就是你的悲哀。自尊心固然是寳貴的，但自尊心膨脹以至於無極，那是變成了目空一世的唯我獨尊的畸人呵！極端的個人主義者，尤其是女子。在現代社會是難以幸福地生存着的呵！</p>
<p>你莫夢想着祗要你努力奮鬭，一有威權與金錢，愛人是不成問題的。愛，固然可以用威權掠奪，也可以用金錢收買，可是，你所得的並不是愛人，而是人的俘虜呵！</p>
<p>你還須記牢：新人没有舊人好，初戀愛的人是永遠不會忘記的呵！</p>
<p>然而，你如果悔過，可是已經遲了！</p>
<p>人傑自從醫院出來以後，性情，意志，思想，觀念，完全都度了啦。</p>
<p>久雨必晴，他正是一隻風雨表。</p>
<p>那一天，我去找他，｜｜就是你們住的家｜｜第一令我詫異的是，他舉止遲鈍，人蒼老，不大喜歡說話；而且從原有的憤慨的表情上他去了失望，來了樂觀，他變成了一個沉毅勇敢的戰士模樣的人。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, after the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy arose, Huang Shaoxiong went to Bailing Temple to negotiate the autonomy plan. Because the representatives of various leagues and banners had disputes over the meaning of the clauses, the government is currently mediating. It is reported that a certain representative suddenly received a telegram, which was a secret telegram from Wu, a certain director of the Zhangjiakou Bureau, requesting him to contact other representatives to fundamentally oppose the autonomy plan stipulated by the Central Government, and inciting them to leave Beijing as a group and communicate with a certain staff officer sent by the Japanese puppets. However, it is reported that the representative clearly understands the great righteousness and has expressed to others that China's five ethnic groups are equal, and the Mongolian people have a unique spirit in history and status. As a representative, he will never be induced by any evil forces, and believes that Wu is intentionally insulting him. He has reported the details to his superiors and expressed his feelings to the authorities. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama Arrived in Beijing Yesterday Afternoon</h3>

The Panchen Lama, supported by his attendants, walked out of the station and boarded a ferry to cross the river. The Panchen Lama and Dai rode in the same car to the Panchen Lama's residence at No. 5 Shenjia Lane. Lin and Wang visited and left after a brief conversation. In the afternoon, the Panchen Lama paid respects to Lin, Wang, and Chiang. He attended the plenary session in the morning of the 25th. According to the Panchen Lama, who spoke to a Central News Agency reporter at his residence, he had been away from Beijing for more than a year. In the spring of last year, due to the North China Incident, he was ordered by the commander of the Beiping Military Branch to travel west to Xuanhua, and received telegrams from various leagues and banners welcoming him to preach the Dharma. Later, he preached the Dharma in Ujimqin and Xilingol League and other places, which took five years to complete. Afterwards, he was stationed at Bailing Temple. Recently, he was summoned to Beijing by President Wang via telegram to discuss border affairs and attend the plenary session. Also, due to the passing away of the Dalai Lama, Chairman Lin and President Dai, among others, established altars to offer prayers, and instructed him to preside over the ceremony, so he set out for Beijing. At the beginning of the Inner Mongolian autonomy issue, he immediately informed all the princes to respect the wishes of the Central Government. Later, Minister Huang came to the temple to meet with the princes, and he made every effort to mediate. The princes deeply understood the great righteousness, so the autonomy issue was resolved. All Mongolian banners have sent personnel to Beijing to thank the Central Government for its benevolence. As for the passing of the Dalai Lama, he only learned about it after receiving a telegram from Beijing. He was deeply saddened by the news. Although he and the Dalai Lama had some misunderstandings in the past, they have recently been cleared up. The Dalai Lama had expressed his welcome for him to return to Tibet. He was deeply saddened by his sudden death. In addition to ordering all the lama temples in Mongolia, Tibet, and Qinghai to chant sutras and offer prayers, he also wrote a book, instructing the Dalai Lama to reincarnate as soon as possible so that the political and religious leadership would have someone to preside over it. There are rumors that chaos has recently occurred in Tibet, but he has not heard of it yet. He has no suggestions for the plenary session. Whether he will enter Tibet or not is all up to the Central Government. He has just arrived in Beijing, and his future movements have not yet been decided.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Rescuing Northeastern Students Who Have Lost Their Education - A Caution</h3>
<p>For the past two years, the Northeast Four Provinces have been in turmoil. The sudden outbreak of the Mukden Incident (September 18th Incident) ignited national righteous indignation, leading to a courageous fight against the tyrannical invaders. Countless people have sacrificed their lives under the enemy's swords and guns, and in the line of fire. While these heroic sacrifices may not be enough to recover the Northeast, they are enough to bring glory to the nation and add color to the history of the Northeast's fall. Recently, Northeastern youths, reflecting on the past, cannot suppress their indignation. Witnessing the invaders' unyielding ambitions to completely annex the Northeast, transforming the former Three Eastern Provinces into what Korea is today, their emotions of grief and anger are even stronger than those of youths in the interior. We anticipate that among the intellectuals from the Northeast Four Provinces, except for a few who have surrendered to Japanese imperialism, none do not long for the recovery of their homeland.</p>
<p>However, today's China is deeply ill. To break through the current difficulties, a period of stability is necessary. From this stability, a methodical construction can be planned, followed by adequate preparations. Consequently, many youths feel impatient and frustrated, believing that waiting for the Yellow River to clear is impossible. This is understandable, as the economic lives of youths originally from the Northeast were generally better before the September 18th Incident, due to the region's superior economic conditions compared to the interior.</p>
<p>Therefore, their personal living environments were also better. However, this unprecedented blow abruptly turned a once prosperous area into foreign territory overnight. Their means of livelihood were suddenly overturned, and their assets were even confiscated, leaving them with nowhere to return. They had no choice but to turn to Tianjin and Beiping, with a bleak future and no idea where to go. This situation is truly pitiable.</p>
<p>The total number of Northeastern students who have transferred to schools in Tianjin, Beiping, and other places is estimated to be around 10,000. The government has instructed all schools to exempt Northeastern students from tuition fees. Recently, a stipend plan has been drafted, both to encourage the diligent study of these afflicted youths and to provide relief to homeless students. This is indeed a measure to revitalize national consciousness. However, the total number of youths and children in the Northeast who are of education age is at least over 400,000. Now, under Japanese oppression, they are either unable to continue their education due to economic exploitation, unwilling to accept their slave-like education due to Japanese political coercion, restricted by their location, or forced by circumstances to languish under the iron heel of the Japanese army, suffering in silence for days on end. Their numbers are tens, if not hundreds, of times greater than the number of Northeastern students who have lost their education and drifted into the interior. While it is impossible to reach those youths under the Japanese army's iron heel, every effort should be made to provide immediate relief to the Northeastern students drifting in the interior, to prevent them from losing their education and to enable them to achieve something, so that they can serve the country in the future and shoulder the arduous task of national salvation. This is of utmost importance and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have something else to say. While immediate relief should be provided to youths who have lost their education, those who have been displaced and lost their homes due to the resistance against Japan, with nowhere to go, should not be left unemployed and destitute for long, lest they add another layer of difficulty to the national movement in the future. Thinking of this, the number of unemployed people in our country today is vast, and many cannot be helped. It is not just the Northeastern refugees. However, Northeastern refugees have suffered the most and been the most severely afflicted. Therefore, while providing relief to Northeastern students, policies should also be quickly implemented to aid Northeastern refugees. Whether by establishing public works projects or promoting industries specific to the Northeastern people, efforts must be made to ensure that all unemployed people have work, whether in agriculture, industry, intellectual labor, or commercial transport. They must all be integrated into the production process, which will undoubtedly contribute to China's future revival.</p>

<p>Openly Establishes Government</p>
<p>Engages in Collusion with Afghanistan and India</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to the TASS news agency in Tashkent, a new government has been established in Kashgar, supported by the Hui headsman of Khotan. The new government has declared that the entire western part of Xinjiang is under its jurisdiction and has announced its secession from China. It is reported that a merchant named Dumora has been appointed as the chief representative of the new government and has led a delegation to Afghanistan to negotiate a treaty of friendship. The delegation also plans to visit India. The new government has issued a declaration expressing its independence and has called for the expulsion of Chinese people from Xinjiang. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to reports from Tashkent, Kashgar (Shule), the largest center in southern Xinjiang, has established a new government, supported by the Hui headsman of Khotan, whose territory is close to the border of British India (Kashmir). The head of the new government is a merchant named Sabit Damulla, who is a subordinate of the headsman. The new government claims its territory as the entire western section of the new province, declaring its secession from China and safeguarding its independence. It has also dispatched a delegation to Afghanistan, which borders the southern part of the new province, to negotiate mutual recognition with the Afghan government in Kabul.

<h3>Yang Dezhao Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Dezhao, the representative of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters stationed in Nanjing, returned to his native place of Dapu in December last year to celebrate his mother's birthday. He arrived in Shanghai by ship a few days ago and arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. Secretary Dai, who accompanied Yang, said that Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang of Guangdong firmly opposed the Chen-Li rebellion in Fujian. Fortunately, the Fujian Incident has been resolved. The Southwest is paying close attention to the aftermath of the 19th Route Army. Public opinion is that the 19th Route Army has the glory of resisting Japan in Shanghai, and maintaining its original name would be a credit to the Party and the country. Therefore, the Southwest authorities hope that the Central Government can properly handle it. However, Chen Jitang of Guangdong has no objection to incorporating the army. The rumor that Chen intends to incorporate the army is inaccurate. Guangdong previously planned to borrow 15 million yuan and requested the Central Government's guarantee to rescue the financial situation. It is reported that the Central Government has agreed to provide assistance, so this case may be postponed. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Detour to Ligangbao</h3>
<p>Beiping Military Council Telegrams Sun to Halt Advance</p>
<p>Sun Requests Central Government to Quickly Devise Measures</p>
<p>Critical Situation in Ningxia Province</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun's troops have crossed Pingluo and advanced to Ligangbao. Whether Pingluo has been captured by Sun's army is not yet known as Beiping has not received a report. The Beiping authorities are awaiting orders from the Central Government to resolve the situation. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Council decided this morning to send a telegram ordering the cessation of military action. Ligangbao has been occupied by Sun's army, and the Ma army has suffered considerable losses. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's cavalry and artillery are still besieging Pingluo. Another unit of infantry has detoured to Ligangbao (40 miles from Ningxia). The Ma army in Ningxia is doing its best to resist. The authorities here are very dissatisfied with Sun's defiance of orders to advance west. After requesting instructions from the Central Government on how to handle the situation, they will take action. Hou Cheng, who was ordered to go to Shanxi, has temporarily stayed in Taiyuan, and it is uncertain when he will return to Beiping. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is scheduled to leave Beiping for Zhangjiakou on the 26th. Qin Decun will accompany him. The situation in Ningxia is extremely urgent. It is reported that Song is trying to mediate. The authorities in North China are still awaiting orders from the Central Government on how to handle the situation before instructing both sides to comply. A telegram from Ningxia on the 22nd reported that the Gansu and Qinghai armies are on standby to advance. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying's telegram, urgently addressed to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, the Central Executive Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Examination Yuan: I, a simple military man, lack learning. After the War of Resistance against Japan, the Central Government, mindful of the hard-fought lives of tens of thousands of officers and soldiers, ordered us to go to Qinghai to reclaim wasteland. Previously, Chairman Ma of Ningxia did not allow us to pass through. Recently, due to the extreme cold and snowy weather in the Wulin area, with no housing and exposed to the elements, frostbite and deaths are inevitable. After consulting with Director Yan, he agreed to allow my army to be stationed in a part of the fertile land in the southwest of Suiyuan Province to spend the winter, not to march the entire army. Chairman Ma still misunderstands, stopping the troops advancing on the road to Shizuizi. After receiving orders, I immediately ordered the troops to stop advancing. However, the troops advancing through the Hedong area had not yet reached Wulin when the Ningxia Ma army, claiming that Wulin was under Ningxia's jurisdiction, sent troops to counterattack and wiped out my battalion under Li, resulting in a conflict. (Omitted) I earnestly request the speedy dispatch of senior officials to investigate the facts, clearly order punishment, and also request that these tens of thousands of stranded and impoverished officers and soldiers be graciously dealt with. Although we are stranded in the wilderness, with limited options, lacking food and clothing, crying out in hunger and cold, with nowhere to return, we dare not disobey your orders, and will do our utmost with our foolish sincerity, and repay the country's gracious kindness with our hot blood and heads. I humbly submit my request for your consideration. Qinghai Reclamation Director and Commander of the 41st Army Sun Kuiyuan respectfully bows. (24th Dispatch) (Beiping) Ligangbao, only thirteen miles from Ningxia's provincial capital, has been occupied by Sun Dianying's army. It is feared that the provincial army defending Pingluo will have to surrender because their retreat route has been cut off. The Beiping Military Council considered the Ningxia matter this morning and decided to await instructions from Nanjing. People here now hope that Yan Xishan and Song Zheyuan will step in to mediate. The situation in Ningxia's provincial capital is very serious, and communication with Beiping may have been interrupted. (24th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Committee's Message to the People of the Nation</h3>
<p>To Quell the Fujian Rebellion</p>
<p>Aiming to Unify Will</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's message to the people of the nation regarding quelling the Fujian rebellion reads as follows: Since the rebel Chen Mingshu and others colluded with bandits and launched a rebellion, raising troops in Fujian, the news of the turmoil spread far and wide, arousing indignation throughout the country. Denouncing their crimes and demanding their punishment, the righteous cause was awe-inspiring. The Central Government, concerned about Fujian, was determined to safeguard the foundation of the nation, and thus ordered the army to swiftly suppress and eliminate them. The power of the military forced the rebel army to collapse and flee, and the fundamental suppression is imminent. This is due to the strategic command of the military leaders, the loyalty and courage of the soldiers at the front, and the support of public opinion and the condemnation of the people, which clearly distinguished right from wrong. Now, after quelling the rebellion, the Central Government, deeply concerned about the people's suffering, hereby proclaims several points to our people: The Three Principles of the People of our Party are the highest principles led by our Party Leader to revive the Chinese nation and lead the national revolution. Although they have not been fully realized due to internal and external troubles, each rebellion has made the principles more evident. All heresies and fallacies cannot shake them in the slightest. As of today, our Party's principles are intertwined with national construction and national survival, and cannot be separated. Those who betray our Party's principles and undermine the national revolution are tantamount to destroying national construction and endangering national survival. They will inevitably be subjected to the sanctions of public justice of the entire nation, and will hardly be spared, and their downfall will follow. Moreover, under the leadership of our Party Leader, we have engaged in the national revolution, undergoing decades of struggle and countless failures before overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China. In 1926, we launched the Northern Expedition, continuing the heroic struggle and sacrifice, in order to eliminate the warlords and revive the Republic of China. Therefore, our Party bears the mission of nurturing, safeguarding, constructing, and prospering the Republic of China, ensuring that the country enters the realm of freedom and equality, and that the people advance towards happiness and prosperity, so that the national revolution will be completely successful and the Three Principles of the People will be fully realized, and only then will we not betray our Party's mission. Those who endanger the unity and peace of the people and undermine the revival and construction of the Republic of China will be exterminated by our Party with all our strength. However, social trends, if not governed, will lead to chaos. Once the vital energy is full, external evils will naturally subside. Learning from past events, we know that to transform chaos into order, the fundamental key lies in the Republic of China's ability to defend and govern itself, and its spirit of striving for survival. Therefore, strengthening social organization is extremely important. If social organization is sound, the people's strength will naturally be strong, which can curb the spread of heresies and sanction the occurrence of rebellions. The outbreak of the Fujian rebellion was extremely rampant, but it was gradually quelled in less than two months. This is not only due to the appropriate military mobilization, but also to the public's condemnation. This shows that the soundness of social organization is closely related to the elimination of rebellions. Furthermore, we would like to say something to the youth of the nation: Domestic reactionaries often try to exploit young people, deceiving them with heresies and fallacies, and enticing them with empty fame and meager profits. Some young people, due to their weak knowledge and wavering will, often disregard right and wrong and willingly become tools. Young people are the pillars of future society and the backbone of national construction. Their mission is extremely important. However, those who have lost their minds and love chaos, in order to achieve their manipulative purposes, do not hesitate to lead them astray, trapping them in punishment, damaging the vital energy of society, and destroying the vitality of the nation. This is especially heartbreaking. In this Fujian rebellion, the rebels arbitrarily exploited young people, using them as tools and making them their sacrifices, which is truly the height of depravity. Young people, reflecting on the past, should also be keenly aware, act cautiously, and encourage each other, channeling their thoughts into the right track and cultivating a solid foundation of knowledge, in order to shoulder the mission of the nation's future. The above points should be deeply understood and jointly corrected by all our people after the incident, in order to curb the seeds of danger and move towards the path of construction. Today, with internal and external troubles, the foundation of the nation is precarious. Only by uniting the will and ability of the people of the nation, with everyone working together, can we maintain the life of the nation and glorify the spirit of history. All our people must unify their will, concentrate their talents, and develop their spirit, in order to turn chaos into order and strive diligently. The saying "difficult times build the nation" is a clear lesson from the past. The historical examples of striving for strength and wiping out humiliation are clear. Therefore, we have listed the key points for everyone to encourage each other. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Direct Franco-German Negotiations Fail, Prospects for Disarmament Dim Further</h3>
<p>British Cabinet Meeting Leans Towards Further Mediation</p>
<p>If There Is Still No Breakthrough, a Convention to Maintain the Status Quo Will Be Agreed Upon</p>
<p>(Paris) The situation on disarmament has become dark again. Reuters has learned from reliable sources in Paris that the French government is disappointed with the German reply. The attitude expressed by Germany in its reply is described by the French as delaying and unfavorable to bilateral negotiations. Therefore, from now on, all hopes for disarmament will gradually fade. The exchange of notes between France and Germany only shows that the two sides have major differences of opinion in principle. It is said that the German reply did not make any concessions to the French proposal, but only offered theoretical arguments in a polite way to prove the legitimacy of its previous demands. The note also raised many technical questions, which are currently being carefully studied by the ministers of the French defense departments. The French government is paying close attention to tomorrow's British Cabinet meeting, which will discuss whether Britain should propose any suggestions to Germany to resolve the arms dispute. Germany also recently replied to Britain's inquiry about certain aspects of the equality demands, implying that Germany welcomes such suggestions. The main result of accepting this invitation will be for Britain to step in and mediate, and to make suggestions to alleviate the Franco-German conflict. However, France now feels that the executive committee of the Disarmament Conference should firmly decide at the London meeting in February whether the disarmament convention should be signed by Germany, so that the Disarmament Conference can decide its own future. The meaning of certain aspects is that countries should, in accordance with the suggestion of Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Benes, conclude a convention, mutually agreeing to maintain the current level of armaments without expanding them, and stipulating that if any party violates the convention, all signatory countries can withdraw from the convention and act freely.

<h3>British Inclination to Mediate</h3>
<p>Commercial Recovery Depends on Successful Disarmament</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet will convene tomorrow to consider Germany's response to France's disarmament proposals, as well as various questions concerning this matter from Britain. Germany has requested Britain to act as a third-party mediator. The British Cabinet finds this to be a difficult decision. At the same time, public opinion in London tends to oppose involvement in the Franco-German affair. However, leading politicians believe that the recovery of world commerce depends on the success of disarmament. Therefore, it is believed that Britain's acceptance of Germany's request could lead to an earlier successful disarmament. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet's Disarmament Subcommittee met this afternoon, chaired by Lord President of the Council Baldwin, as Prime Minister MacDonald had gone to the Leeds area to continue campaigning for the National Government's policies. During the meeting, Foreign Secretary Simon explained to his colleagues the German reply to France and the answers to the points raised by British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, on December 20th.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the Cabinet seems to advocate Britain acting as a mediator again. While the mediation approach will not deviate from Prime Minister MacDonald's original disarmament plan, recent German negotiations will be taken into account to achieve mutual adaptation. Semi-official sources believe that Britain wants to "bridge" and connect the views of France and Germany. The Cabinet's Disarmament Subcommittee today is seeking a way to build this bridge. Although diplomatic circles are keeping this matter strictly confidential, the impression among those close to the government is more optimistic than yesterday. After studying the German reply, the government feels that although an immediate compromise is not possible, there is at least the possibility of reopening negotiations to seek a compromise. It is generally believed that the outcome of Britain's re-mediation will depend on the extent of concessions we can demand from both sides. This point is not concealed. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Truth about German Armaments</h3>
<p>Will Make Demands with Strength in the Future</p>
<p>(London) A correspondent for The Times in Berlin has written a lengthy article examining German military activities under the rule of the National Socialist Party. His conclusion is that German rearmament is a fait accompli, or at least well on its way to completion. Since German rearmament cannot be eradicated at the root, the goal of European countries should be to compel Germany to rearm for peaceful purposes. The article states that Germany is deliberately moving towards military equality and pursuing this goal through rearmament. Germany's initial proposal to France involved a substantial increase in the German army. In the eighteen months since former Chancellor Papen took office, Germany has decided to rearm, as the nation's youth look forward to rearmament as a means of advancement, and industry expects rearmament to increase its orders. All kinds of desires rely on rearmament for satisfaction. Leading figures in German political circles have made declarations expressing their unwavering determination to rearm Germany immediately, without further delay. If Germany is prepared to negotiate with other countries, the negotiations will only concern the length of military service and the quantity of future Party army armaments. Therefore, German rearmament is no longer in question. The question is whether Germany is rearming because its national defense is not secure or whether it intends to use force to achieve its ultimate political goals. The correspondent then provides a detailed analysis of military technology, concluding that today we cannot ignore the irrefutable evidence. From now on, Germany will rely on its powerful military force to make demands. If we do not want to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the obvious facts, then it is almost inevitable that we will reach a satisfactory agreement with Germany on the issue of armaments. This is the only way to study whether Germany can cooperate sincerely to maintain peace in Europe. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald's Lobbying Consolidates Government Position</h3>
<p>Britain is Loyal to the League of Nations</p>

When he spoke, some cheered while others booed, repeatedly interrupting his speech. The Prime Minister mentioned the tariff negotiations between Britain and France, saying that France's recent proposals were extremely unfair to British industry and that the French would soon realize this unfairness. The British government is now prepared to begin work, as soon as circumstances permit, on establishing agreements that remove unnecessary obstacles to commerce among nations. The British government is loyal to the League of Nations and hopes that cooperation between Italy, France, and smaller countries will strengthen the League to cope with current difficulties.

<h3>U.S. Senate Silver Committee Passes Roosevelt Currency Bill</h3>
<p>But With Significant Amendments</p>
<p>Stabilization Fund Operation Limited to Two Years</p>
<p>(Washington) The currency bill proposed by President Roosevelt has been passed by the Senate Banking Committee by a majority of 15 votes to 2 votes, but with two amendments attached. The first stipulates that the Exchange Equalization Fund should be managed by a separate committee of five members: the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, the Comptroller of the Currency, and two others appointed by the President. The second amendment limits the existence of the Exchange Equalization Fund to two years in theory but authorizes the President to extend the term if necessary. There are general concerns that currency may not be redeemable, and many advocate that the new dollar should be redeemable for large gold bars, according to the current French system. There are also deep concerns that credit expansion will be virtually unlimited after the bill is passed, which may lead to a sharp rise in prices and trigger another financial panic. The White House is also aware of this danger, so Roosevelt has indicated that the Civil Works Administration's funding, which was previously used to employ four million workers, will be halted on May 1st.

<h3>British Manchester Rejects Japanese Goods Movement</h3>
<p>Minister of Commerce Rushes to Hear Opinions</p>
<p>(London) Manchester held a large demonstration against the dumping of foreign goods today, with speakers focusing on Japanese competition. Thousands of people participated in the demonstration, including several Conservative Members of Parliament, representatives from various parts of the cotton industry, and mayors of important cities in Lancashire. The first speaker today was Conservative MP Astor, who pointed out that tariffs were insufficient to eliminate dumping and advocated a straightforward ban. Another MP, Lees-Smith, said that if no action was taken, the next election would sweep away all current cabinet members. MP Shackleton asked why the Japanese delegation had been in Britain for months but had not yet received instructions from Tokyo. After the meeting, a motion was passed amidst loud shouts, demanding that the government immediately take measures to resist Japanese competition, abolish all most-favored-nation treatment clauses in the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty, and advise British colonies and dominions to do the same. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of Commerce Runciman is leaving for Manchester today, where he will hold two days of discussions with representatives from various parts of the cotton industry. Runciman will discuss two matters with the cotton industry: Japanese competition and the reorganization of the Lancashire cotton industry. The fact that the Japanese delegation has not yet received instructions from Tokyo to begin negotiations is now causing impatience among the British, as can be seen from yesterday's demonstration in Manchester. Runciman's trip to Manchester should not be interpreted as government intervention; he merely wants to hear the opinions of those in the cotton industry on the ground. Several advisors will accompany him, and they are expected to return to London on Friday. After arriving in Manchester, they will meet with members of the local Chamber of Commerce and representatives of various Lancashire cotton organizations to discuss everything. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan Did Not Protest Against Italian Commentary</h3>

According to Italian authorities, the Japanese ambassador has not yet contacted the Italian government about this matter. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>British Far East Navy to Centralize at Singapore</h3>
<p>Secret Meeting on HMS Kent</p>
<p>The Mystery of European War Hero Allenby's Visit</p>
<p>(London) The news that British General Allenby, who enjoyed fame in the European War, is about to visit the Far East has led to speculation in Singapore and other places that General Allenby will participate in a British Far East naval conference. Although Allenby claims that his visit to the East is purely for leisure, he has ultimately failed to dispel rumors of his participation in the meeting. Therefore, the Admiralty and War Office have had to issue denials, stating that General Allenby is visiting the Far East in a purely private capacity, without any official mission, and that General Allenby is not currently an active member of the military.</p>
<p>Reuters learned from reliable sources that newspaper speculation related to the Singapore naval conference and defense projects is largely exaggerated. According to official statements, the Singapore conference is merely a routine event that occurs automatically, and the defense projects are simply being carried out in accordance with policies that were approved many years ago. Cabinet members have repeatedly stated this in the House of Commons, and there are no new developments or changes to the original purely local defense policy.</p>
<p>This statement is very different from various rumors. The source of newspaper speculation is likely due to the secret holding of the Singapore naval conference, which was held on the British ship Kent, which was docked in the most secluded location in the port of Singapore. This is why rumors have arisen.</p>
<p>It is heard that the agenda has the following four items: (1) Discussion of Singapore's future as a naval concentration point; (2) Progress of various naval base projects; (3) The situation in the Far East; (4) General events related to the local fleet. However, the Admiralty has not announced the agenda, so it is not yet fully known whether the above four items are accurate.</p>
<p>The Singapore conference began in 1921, but the current one is the first in the past eight years. Attendees include Vice Admiral Dreyer, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China; Vice Admiral Nasmith; Rear Admiral Dalgleish; Rear Admiral Watson; Governor of the Straits Settlements Clementi; and Commander of Malaya Sir Cecil Clementi, among others. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail today carried an editorial stating that the attention aroused by the Singapore naval conference proves that the policy issues of the British Empire in the Far East and the Pacific are becoming increasingly important. It also said that the situation created by the active naval policies of the United States and Japan may not necessarily harm the interests of the British Empire, but it is quite clear that the time has come for prudent consideration of the necessities of Singapore's defense. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Evening Standard published an editorial commenting on the opening of the British naval conference in Singapore, stating that all parties advocate making good use of Singapore's new naval port and defending it. This conference is tantamount to approving this proposition. From the standpoint of the British Empire, the significance of this conference is very great. The newspaper then explained Singapore's defense plan, saying that Britain absolutely needs to station a navy in the Far East. The newspaper continued, "Anyone who points out the severity of the situation runs the risk of being ridiculed as preparing for war, but the need to protect the sea lanes that British commerce must pass through is unanimously recognized by enlightened people all over the world." The Singapore naval port is not a threat, and Japan has understood this. Did Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota not recently say in a speech that the two major naval powers of East and West are in the same position and that there is a possibility of mutual cooperation to maintain peace? This is exactly the attitude that Britain wants. In short, the Singapore naval port is beneficial to peace, not a preparation for war. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Massive Naval Plan</h3>
<p>Passed by House Naval Committee</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee today unanimously passed the Vinson bill to build 120 warships. To expedite progress, the committee plans to incorporate the bill into the annual naval appropriations bill currently under review in the House. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Vinson, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, has proposed a five-year naval construction plan, requesting an appropriation of $380 million to build warships to expand the U.S. Navy to the limits permitted by the London Naval Treaty. This sum will be paid over five years, at $75 million per year. The Naval Affairs Committee has unanimously passed this bill. Admiral Standley, Chief of Naval Operations, declared that he would request Congress for an appropriation of $15 million to $25 million in order to begin building 20 warships before June of this year.

<h3>Interpellations at the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<h3>Seiyukai (Constitutional Association) Members Advocate Active Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Hirota Answers that He Will Proceed Slowly</p>
<p>Must Seek Understanding from All Countries First</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's plenary session of the House of Representatives opened at 1:19 p.m., starting with interpellations to the Ministers of State. Tadaharu Machida of the Minseito Party (Democratic Constitutional Party) took the stage, saying that it was most important to promote the development of "Manchukuo" and to explain the pointless suspicions to all countries, which requires active diplomatic work. That is, Japan must implement a diplomacy that makes China realize without waiting for it to become aware, and whether the government has taken active measures to ensure friendly relations with others. He also said that Japan must pursue its claims in 1935 with diplomatic means that go beyond justice, advocating the necessity of active diplomatic work. The Minseito Party applauded in agreement. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that Japan's belief in "Manchukuo" would naturally lead other countries to gradually understand, and that he also agreed with active work towards China, but the objective situation does not allow for rapid action and it is intended to proceed slowly. There will also be no difficulties in 1935, and efforts are being made to seek mutual understanding with the United States. The term crisis should not mislead the people or neighboring countries.

<h3>Tokonami Declares Determination to Protect the Constitution</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday's speech by Tokonami Takejirō, advisor to the Seiyukai Party, in the Diet was highly regarded by all sectors. Two points, in particular, are expected to influence the political situation: First, he strongly advocated parliamentary politics, which is a system clearly defined by the Meiji Constitution and should not be lightly abandoned. Second, he cited the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War as examples of times when Japanese political parties unanimously supported the Japanese military in combat, enabling the Japanese army to win on the battlefield. Party politics and war policies are beneficial and harmless. Tokonami's speech was a frank statement of the party's determination and contributed greatly to the cooperation movement between the Minseito and Seiyukai parties. The cooperation between the two parties may be realized at an accelerated pace from now on. (Hualian Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Investigation into the Military's Propaganda for War</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Seiyukai Party member Ando Masazumi questioned the government in the Lower House today, opposing the government's, especially the military's, suppression of speech. The main points of Ando's questions are as follows: (1) The theory of Japanese fascism and dictatorship is very prevalent, seeking to emulate the dictatorial politics of Germany and Italy and place Japan's politics under the control of a small number of people. What is the government's opinion on this movement? (2) The military is vigorously promoting that there will be a war in 1936. What is the basis for this? (3) The military has recently adopted a policy of secrecy, unwilling to let the people know all important issues. Does the military really believe that the army can wage war abroad without the support of the people?</p>
<h3>Japan's Warmongering Arouses Antipathy in Various Countries</h3>
<p>The Military Reins in on the Brink of Precipice and Plans to Crack Down</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The remarks of young officers in the Japanese military have been interpreted in the United States, Russia, and Italy as the Japanese military's intention to create a war. Publishing companies and magazine supplements are catering to current preferences for war propaganda, such as "Hi no De's" (Rising Sun) "Future Record of the Japanese-American War" and "Our Navy" being confiscated in the United States, and Commander-in-Chief Suetsugu's remarks published in "Modern" being blamed by the US Naval Command as articles inciting war, etc. All countries are paying close attention to the military's remarks, and the issue was raised in the Japanese Diet yesterday, demanding that the government crack down on publications that incite war. It is heard that the Ministry of the Army, mindful of the extremely dangerous atmosphere at home and abroad, is also planning to crack down on this kind of speech. (Hualian Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Shimbun (Eastern News) states that US newspapers in San Francisco commented on Foreign Minister Hirota's speech, saying that Japan loves peace and the United States also seeks peace, but the Japanese publishing industry is colluding with the military, vigorously promoting war, especially against the United States. The Japanese government allows its publishing and news media to publish articles that intimidate the United States and undermine US military institutions, and serious crackdowns should be carried out on such writings. (Hualian Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(4) The military is vigorously suppressing the speech of the people, single-mindedly wanting the people to believe that there will be a war in 1936, and does not allow the people to ask why there will be a war, and whether there will really be a war. What is the military's intention? (5) The military issued a statement last year opposing the alienation of the military and the people. Is the military's true intention to suppress speech, or is there really such a fact? Army Minister Hayashi's answer was very simple. Navy Minister Osumi also said that it was inconvenient to answer with facts, and if facts were answered, it would have an impact on foreign countries, so he could open a secret meeting to explain. Because the Minseito Party was pressing hard, the military could no longer refuse, and agreed to hold two secret meetings to explain the military's position, which ended at 4:48 pm. (Hualian Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Katō Masanosuke, a member of the upper house belonging to the Minseito Party, questioned this morning in the Diet on financial problems and military preparedness, criticizing the military for deliberately exaggerating war propaganda and inciting war. The main points of his speech were as follows: The world economy is in turmoil, and the finances of all countries are inadequate, as is Japan's own difficulty. The United Kingdom has balanced its budget after two years of effort. Does the Japanese Ministry of Finance intend to take the United Kingdom as an example? The military is vigorously promoting the crisis of 1935. What kind of facts does the military's so-called crisis refer to? At present, due to the military's propaganda, many people believe that there will be a war in 1935, which has led the financial world to take a negative attitude and dare not invest actively. Observing the internal affairs of the United States and Russia, if Japan does not challenge the two countries, there will be no war. Because the military is promoting war, the Ministry of Finance is sacrificing everything to expand useless military preparedness. During a period of progress, it is not necessary to adopt a policy of contraction of finances, but comparing the budgets of the 8th and 9th years, next year's budget has exceeded 2.3 billion yuan. Does the government intend to increase taxes? Will the government still allow the Bank of Japan to buy up government bonds? (Hualian Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Reactions of Public Opinion in Various Countries to Hirota's Diplomatic Speech</h3>
<p>No Less Than Declaring an Asian Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Harboring Ambitions to Control China</p>
<p>(London) Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's speech in the House of Peers has aroused two conflicting interpretations in the press here. One is that Japan intends to invade all of China, and the other is that Hirota's attitude shows that he is moderate and intends to approach Europe and the United States. Political figures, however, take a compromise between the two, saying that Hirota's intention seems to be to declare an Asian Monroe Doctrine, which in itself is not without arguments, but may be detrimental to the development of British interests in the Far East. Political figures believe that the meaning of Hirota's speech is only this, and not as much as what the "Daily People's Voice" and the "Times" have said, the former saying that Japan has ambitions to control all of China, and the latter saying that Japan will cooperate with Europe and the United States, both of which are going to extremes.

<h3>Japanese-Russian Relations Becoming Increasingly Tense, Japan Feels Threatened by the United States and Russia Joining Hands</h3>
<p>(Paris) There has been little commentary in France on the resignation of Japanese Army Minister Araki, due to the lack of sufficient information here on the relationship of Araki's resignation to its impact on Japanese foreign policy. However, people in general are very satisfied with the following: Although Japanese-Russian relations have always been tense, it seems that a conflict is not necessarily inevitable. Recently, Soviet Russian Heavy Industry Representative Kaganovich delivered a speech that truly expressed the Soviet Russian side's major concerns, but people in general believe that the restoration of normal relations between the United States and Russia is nothing less than a tranquilizing agent for the tense situation between Japan and Russia, and is truly a factor of stability in the Pacific. (Kaganovich is the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Moscow District Committee). (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Various Countries Are Busy Preparing Policies Towards Japan; Empty Words of Peace Will Not Achieve Results</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung commented on the Japanese Foreign Minister's speech in the House of Peers, considering it a masterpiece of a great statesman. It stated, "From Hirota's speech, it can be seen that Japan attaches great importance to the situation in China and its relations with Russia. Japan is closely observing the activities of Soviet Russia in China and reserves the possibility of intervention. Hirota clearly stated that the progress of diplomatic relations between Japan and Soviet Russia depends entirely on the attitude of Soviet Russia towards 'Manchukuo.' Foreign Minister Hirota repeatedly spoke of Japan's peaceful efforts in the Pacific, but he did not conceal the fact that Japan's national power development is sufficient to cause some danger." The newspaper concluded, "The U.S. Congress has already proposed a naval construction plan, and naval commanders from Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and other places are holding an Imperial Naval Conference in Singapore. Furthermore, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and Moscow Regional Secretary Kaganovich have also delivered speeches on international policy at the Moscow city district party congress. Therefore, the places where international conflicts may occur and the nature of the conflicts can be generally imagined." (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Concrete Conditions for Receiving Yuguan Were Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Yiwo Telegraphed the Kwantung Army to Report</p>
<p>Tao Shangming Awaits News in Yuguan</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of receiving Yuguan has not been realized due to the excessively harsh conditions proposed by the Japanese side. Tao Shangming was ordered to go to Yuguan a few days ago to negotiate with Yiwo based on our side's formulated policy. Although the Japanese side expressed agreement to the reception, they strongly disputed the relocation of the puppet organizations outside the pass. After several contacts between Tao and Yiwo, a concrete condition has been agreed upon and has been telegraphed by Yiwo directly to the commander of the Kwantung Army for reporting. Therefore, Tao is still staying in Yuguan, waiting for a reply from the Kwantung Army. If the Kwantung Army has no objection, the reception can be started. According to sources in relevant circles, the Japanese side recently indicated that if negotiations proceed smoothly, our side could take over in early next month. However, the issue of Dongluo City was not discussed. The Japanese are building barracks in Dongluo City, most of which are now completed, and some Japanese and Korean merchants in Yuguan have already moved there. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Site Selection for the Central Machine Factory Changed Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Machine Factory is being prepared with funds borrowed from the British Boxer Indemnity. The factory site was originally selected in Caoxie Gorge, covering an area of over one hundred mu. However, the terrain there is too low, and filling the foundation would require 190,000 yuan, which is not cost-effective. Therefore, another factory site will be purchased, and the land in Caoxie Gorge will be sold at the prevailing price. Once a decision is made, Lu Weifu, the director in charge of the factory's preparation, will depart for England to order machinery. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Restricts the Purchase of Materials by Military Organizations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that in the past, various military organizations have generally estimated and requested funds when ordering materials from abroad. There was no detailed plan beforehand, and no serious acceptance inspection was conducted afterward. The waste and extravagance involved were self-evident. Yesterday, he ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to inform all subordinate units that in the future, if any military organization orders goods from abroad with a value of over 3,000 yuan, it must first submit its purpose and order plan, along with the necessary estimate, drawings, and samples. After the review and approval of the responsible auditing office, Chiang himself will personally approve it before a contract can be signed. When the goods are delivered, the auditing office must also be requested to inspect and audit them before the procedures can be completed. This will be a standing rule from now on and must not be deliberately violated. (Special Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Banknotes Dance From a High Building</h3>
<p>A Wealthy Greek Man Abhors Money</p>
<p>Passersby Scramble, Order Is Greatly Disrupted</p>
<p>Athens A wealthy Greek industrialist named Ramas developed a strange habit today. From the top of his residential building, he scattered banknotes of 100, 500, and 1,000 drachmas (the Greek currency) downwards, causing passersby to scramble for them. This news spread rapidly throughout the city, and tens of thousands of people gathered spontaneously, vying to grab the banknotes fluttering in the air. By the time the police arrived to suppress the situation, the scramble had turned into a riot. They had to mobilize reserve soldiers to disperse the crowd. The police then entered Ramas's residence and prohibited him from throwing banknotes again. However, when Lai saw the police enter his room, he tore up the piles of banknotes in front of him and told the police that he deeply hated this filthy money and was tired of being burdened by it. Later, the police, believing that he was mentally disturbed, sent him to a hospital. His family checked his accounts and found that he had scattered over 100,000 drachmas in a short period.

<h3>Japan's Preparations for Disarmament (Tokyo Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Convening a Joint Consultative Conference of the Three Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy</p>
<p>Three Principles for Dealing with Disarmament Have Been Decided</p>
<p>It will be two full years since Japan announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations in March of last year. Judging from Japan's political situation and military actions in the past year,</p>
<p>There is, of course, no hope of returning to the League of Nations before March of next year. However, in just over a year, Japan will formally withdraw from the League of Nations. Consequently, three major problems have arisen:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of returning the mandated territory of the South Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of "Manchukuo" not being recognized by countries around the world.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of reducing naval armaments.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Japanese military and the government have decided to forcefully occupy the first issue and will never return it to the League of Nations. Because Japan already has considerable military facilities on the Caroline and Mariana Islands, it has made military preparations against the United States and Britain. Therefore, it will absolutely not readily relinquish control of the South Pacific Islands, either now or in the future. Regarding the situation in the puppet state, even within Japan, apart from the military authorities, there is some sense of alienation. However, only Japanese militarists claim it is a country, while all countries around the world have unanimously rejected Japan since the summer of last year. Although the reasons for this rejection should all be attributed to economic factors, politically, it cannot be denied that it is the result of Japan's encouragement of Puyi to create a puppet regime. The United States has stated its opposition, and Britain has also promoted anti-Japanese sentiment. It is feared that the current situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely, allowing Japan to act rampantly in East Asia.</p>
<p>Although optimists in Japanese military circles believe that the US fleet in the Pacific (including the Atlantic fleet) will return to the Atlantic together in April of this year, indicating a considerable understanding of Japan's position and expressing goodwill towards Japan. Therefore, Hirota's new diplomatic policy is particularly friendly to the United States. He believes that there is very little direct military conflict between Japan and the United States, and the current crisis has a high possibility of being averted. However, the reality is not so. The US fleet will still return to the Pacific this autumn. Although the presence of this fleet in the Pacific does not necessarily serve as a challenge, it is undoubtedly a threat to Japan. If Japan continues to proceed in this way, the crisis between Japan and the United States will continue to accumulate, and ultimately, there will only be war. At present, the United States certainly cannot adopt an offensive stance because the United States' naval strength does not have the certainty of victory. However, the United States has concentrated its Atlantic fleet in the Pacific, while refurbishing its unusable warships, and expanding its air force. Long-distance flights between San Francisco and Hawaii are also a trial with great military significance. Furthermore, it will build new warships according to the number allowed by the London Treaty.</p>
<p>Japan's attention to these factual changes will certainly not be relaxed. In addition to actively responding to the second naval replenishment plan, it has also made diplomatic preparations, especially in preparation for the Second Naval Conference. Japan's preparations for international armament issues are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will convene a joint consultative conference of those related to the Army and Navy, which will meet once a week to study new issues arising in Europe and the United States. At the same time, the section chiefs of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy, and officials with the rank of colonel or above, will form a disarmament investigation and research committee to conduct specialized research on disarmament. The committee will collect all information on disarmament and formulate countermeasures to other countries.</p>
<p>(2) The ministers, vice ministers, and related bureau chiefs of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy will form a three-ministry disarmament executive committee. They believe that the invitation to the disarmament conference will be issued by Britain or the United States in June 1935, so Japan must complete all its preparations by October of this year at the latest.</p>
<p>As for Japan's principles on disarmament, first, it promotes an autonomous stance, not subject to any constraints, and demands equality in naval armaments, completely overturning the ratio stipulated by the Washington Treaty. Second, regarding the scope of the agenda, Japan advocates limiting it to naval-related issues such as "naval holdings," "coastal defenses," and "naval bases," and absolutely opposes involving other political issues. In other words, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty cannot be re-raised. Third, if countries have preparatory meetings on disarmament, Japan must participate; otherwise, it will refuse to attend the main conference. This is a countermeasure by Japan to the 1936 crisis and can also be seen as a glimpse of Japan's so-called national policy. (January 18, 1934, Tokyo)</p>

It is reported that the Japanese aims are, firstly, to use Pu Yi's ascension to the throne to buy the hearts of the people in Manchuria and Mongolia; and secondly, to advance towards Chahar and Suiyuan to complete their Manchuria-Mongolia policy. As for North China, they will decide their strategy of invasion based on how we respond. After the Japanese and puppet troops in Eastern Chahar harassed Longmensuo, they temporarily withdrew their troops after our negotiations. However, they are still using the excuse that troops cannot be stationed along the Great Wall line to demand that we withdraw our troops stationed in the Longmensuo area. We argue that the Longmensuo area is not within the scope of the Tanggu Truce and it is impossible to withdraw our troops. The Japanese troops still disagree. Nishio Giichi, the commander of the 8th Division of the Japanese Army, sent a telegram to Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, yesterday (the 22nd), pointing out that we had increased troops in Longmensuo and other places. Shibayama then visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu based on the telegram and verbally questioned them. He and Huang both stated that there was no such thing. Furthermore, at 2 PM yesterday, Qin Dechun visited Shibayama and formally replied, firmly denying the increase in troops, and asked Shibayama to forward the telegram to Nishio Giichi. This kind of action by the Japanese side is purely a provocation, regardless of whether the facts are true or not. Song Zheyuan, the Chairman of Chahar, who was visiting relatives in Tianjin, was summoned back to Beiping late last night. Today, he separately visited He and Huang. At the regular meeting of the Military Affairs Commission tomorrow (the 24th), the issue of Eastern Chahar will be brought up for discussion. After Song attends the meeting, he will immediately return to Chahar.</p>
<p>Recently, puppet rebels and traitors have been active in the Beiping and Tianjin areas, plotting wrongdoing. However, they have not succeeded due to the strict prevention by the authorities. Since the puppet organization announced its reform on the 20th, traitors have become even more arrogant. Recently, they have been sending threatening letters to various newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin in the names of the East Asia League, North China Residents, and the Yamato Club, etc., preventing the publication of anti-Japanese and critical writings on the puppet organization. The wording is extremely absurd. In addition to intensifying the prevention and arrest of the police and military police in Beiping and Tianjin, personnel have also been secretly dispatched to protect the newspaper offices to prevent unexpected events.

<h3>The Situation in the Northwest is Increasingly Tense, with Fierce Fighting Between the Sun and Ma Factions</h3>
<p>Sun's Troops Cross the River and Advance Westward, Besieging Pingluo</p>
<p>Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Troops Mobilized to Defend Against Sun</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Sun Dianying's troops' westward advance is reportedly due to the large number of soldiers and lack of supplies. They are trapped in Western Suiyuan and unable to survive, so they are heading west to find a way out. Sun was originally appointed as the Commissioner of Reclamation in the Qinghai Border Region. Reclamation and garrisoning in Qinghai would have been justified. However, due to circumstances and restrictions, the Northwest provinces will not allow Sun's troops to gain a foothold there. After a problem arose previously, the Central Government had no fundamental solution. It simply issued an order to temporarily suspend the westward advance, stay in the original defense areas, spend the winter, and discuss the matter later. Now, Sun's troops, with tens of thousands of starving soldiers, are desperately seeking food. Therefore, despite knowing that it violates the Central Government's orders, they cannot openly advance westward. Instead, they claim to be dispersing to defend the fertile fields, secretly planning to move west. Before the launch, they claimed on the one hand that they could not survive the winter and were dispersing to defend the fertile fields, and on the other hand, they obtained the consent of Yan of Shanxi to act as backup. Since the start of the campaign, they have adopted a method of undeclared war, first occupying Zhenkou, where Ningxia and Suiyuan meet, and then probing Shizuishan, the gateway to Ningxia. Ma Hongkui's troops in Ningxia had long been prepared for Sun. The Shizuishan area is strategically located and easy to defend, with heavy troops stationed there. Sun's troops, seeing that Ma's troops were prepared when they attacked Shizuishan, stopped their westward advance after a brief contact and claimed that they were complying with the order to stop the westward advance, detour to Woye, and move south along the Yellow River, dividing their forces to invade Ningxia. Ningxia and Suiyuan are separated by a river. While Shizuishan is easy to defend but difficult to attack, there are many ferries elsewhere and the defense line is long, making it easy to cross the river secretly. In addition, it is now the dead of winter, and the river is dry and frozen, making it possible to cross the river anywhere. The danger of the Yellow River is practically zero. After Sun's troops bypassed Shizuishan, they crossed the river and advanced westward, one route attacking Pingluo, and the other using cavalry to raid Ligangbao between Pingluo and Ningxia, attempting to cut off the connection between Pingluo and Ningxia. Ligangbao is 40 miles from Pingluo and about 60 miles from Ningxia. Yu Shiming's cavalry of Sun's troops has raided the area ten times but failed. They are now focusing all their efforts on attacking Pingluo, hoping to occupy Pingluo and gain a base in Ningxia, before advancing on the provincial capital of Ningxia. Ma Hongkui's troops also consider the terrain of Pingluo to be important and are doing their best to defend it. In recent days, the fighting in that area has been extremely fierce. If Sun's troops continue to advance westward, the war is bound to escalate.</p>
<p>In recent days, both Sun and Ma have sent telegrams to Beiping, engaging in a war of words. The authorities in Beiping believe that although Sun's troops are under the Beiping Military Affairs Commission, geographically they belong to the two Pacification Zones of Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Taiyuan. Therefore, they cannot let this matter go. On the one hand, they telegraphed Sun, ordering him to stop his westward advance. On the other hand, they sent personnel to seek the opinions of Yan of Shanxi, and telegraphed the situation to the Central Government to request instructions, striving to first stop the conflict between the two sides, and then discuss a solution in the long term. It is reported that Shanxi does not have any particular fondness for Sun. However, it is impossible for Shanxi to cooperate with other parties to resolve the issue of Sun's troops. This time, Sun's westward advance is a matter of Shanxi adopting a send-off policy. As Sun's troops move, Wang Jingguo's troops will follow. Since the 19th year, most of the guest troops stationed in Shanxi and Suiyuan have been withdrawn. Currently, the only remaining troops are those of Sun Dianying. His voluntary westward advance is what Shanxi has been praying for. (January 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Mutiny in Yutian Expands</h3>
<p>The Evil Consequences of Reorganizing Bandit Troops</p>
<p>Shi Yousan Pulling Strings Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The mutiny of Hu Xie Wu's Security Corps in Yutian County, Northern Hebei, led by Zhang Futang, has occupied the Yayang Hongqiao area for a week now. This matter has recently shown signs of expansion, and due to certain background relationships, the provincial authorities are finding it difficult to deal with. The Hu Xie Wu Security Corps was originally formed by reorganizing Shi Yousan's rebel army. After the Tanggu Truce was established, Shi Yousan's responsibility of being driven by the Japanese puppets was over. The puppet troops under his command could not be properly placed, so the provincial authorities, together with Li Jichun's puppet troops, reorganized them into security corps, led by Zhao Lei, Li Zuozhou, and Hu Xie Wu. Zhang Futang, the brigade commander of Shi's troops, was incorporated into one of the battalions of Hu Xie Wu's division. Due to budgetary concerns, the provincial authorities limited the number of officers and soldiers in each battalion to no more than 1,000. Hu Xie Wu's recruitment in Yutian actually led to the inability to manage the situation, and his subordinates refused to be reorganized. Therefore, although he wanted to reorganize according to the number set by the province, it was impossible. For several months, the 700-800 officers and soldiers left over after the reorganization could not be properly dealt with. He repeatedly came to the province to ask for instructions. In order to maintain the original plan, the province refused to make any changes. It also issued 3,000 yuan twice to Hu for the dismissal of the remaining officers, but Hu, despite receiving the money, did not dare to do so due to difficulties. Recently, he even used the excuse of insufficient pay to extort money from the local area. Merchants have already contributed several times and are unable to bear the burden. They telegraphed the province, asking them to instruct the division not to extort any more money. Based on the situation, the province strictly ordered the division to reorganize according to the set number. At this point, the division was secretly instigated by Shi Yousan, who was residing in Tianjin, to defect to the puppet side and request to be incorporated into the East Asia League Army. So on January 14th, the mutiny occurred. Zhang Futang initially led a detachment of about 550 people to Yayang Hongqiao Town, 35 miles from Yutian. The town is a famous commercial center in Yutian, with a well-fortified stronghold. The rebel army immediately occupied the town, looting and plundering, raping women, and committing all kinds of crimes. They closed the four gates of the stronghold and guarded them with bandits, prohibiting entry and exit, and demanding that the Chamber of Commerce pay 50,000 yuan. The Chamber of Commerce was unable to raise the money, so the president was arrested and shot. Wealthy merchants and residents were kidnapped. The local militia did not dare to attack rashly because the merchants and residents had not escaped. The rebel army, knowing that the government troops were hesitant to attack, became even more rampant, occupying the town and refusing to leave. On the 18th, the security corps in the city also mutinied one after another. One part fled to Yayang Hongqiao and joined the first group of rebels, and the other part occupied Hongqiao Town, 13 miles from the city, broke into the town, seized the militia's weapons, and shot more than 40 residents. Then, they looted for three days, and sent out a detachment to loot Lin Nan Cang Town, extorting 15,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce. Dong Tianhua, the magistrate of Yutian County, borrowed more than 3,000 militiamen from the nearby Zunhua, Fengrun, and Jixian counties on the 19th, surrounding Yayang Hongqiao and Hongqiao Town to eliminate the rebels. Zhang Futang led the rebel army to resist the attack, and set fire to the entire town of Yayang Hongqiao. The fire started on the night of the 20th, and was still burning on the evening of the 21st. Looking out into the night, the red light illuminated the sky, and the rebels were still resisting. The provincial government received a report a few days ago, and in addition to telegraphing the security corps in the war zone to suppress the rebellion, they also sent Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Inspector of Jiji District, along with Section Chief Li of the provincial government to investigate the truth in order to resolve the matter. Yin and Li left Beiping by long-distance bus on the 21st. The people of Yutian, having suffered a great calamity, sent eight representatives, including the president of the Chamber of Commerce, to the province yesterday to petition, demanding that a large army be sent to suppress the rebellion as soon as possible, so as to prevent the rebels from gathering more and more. According to the provincial government's investigation, Shi Yousan is indeed pulling strings behind the scenes of this rebellion. Shi has not moved from Tianjin, but has people coming and going to deliver messages. In addition, Peng Zuyou, the nephew of Peng Shoushen, the former division commander of the Zhili Army, personally arrived at Yayang Hongqiao Town to command everything on behalf of Shi. Peng was bought by the Japanese side during the Tianjin Incident to be the captain of the plainclothes team, willingly working for the tiger. This time, as soon as there was a disturbance, he was eager to try. Yutian is located in a demilitarized zone, and large armies cannot enter. The rebels have gathered more than 2,000 people. The provincial government is concerned that the few security corps and militia in the war zone will not be able to resolve the situation easily. They plan to come up with a good strategy after receiving the reports from Yin Rugeng and Section Chief Li. (January 23rd)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The County Government Welcomes the Handover of Notorious Bandits for Trial</p>
<p>The cases of the notorious bandits Xia Dasan Mazi and others, who gathered together to rob Wu Youlan's family in Punan Zhujiahang, etc., were investigated by Yang Shijie, who was dispatched by the former Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jing, who purchased information in Shanghai and arrested Xia Dasan Mazi and his wife in the silk factory workshop in Hongkou and escorted them to Songjiang. They confessed that their accomplices, Xia Sanxiao Mazi and others, were still hiding in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province. Chen Shuliang, the former Chief Inspector, was dispatched to Pinghu with a document to arrest Xia Sanxiao Mazi, his mother Wang, and three other bandits, Wang San San, at their address. One Mauser pistol and one 6-inch pistol were found, along with 161 rounds of ammunition and three bandit ships. Because the magistrate of Pinghu County was in the process of changing hands, no one was responsible, so they were not brought back. Xia Dasan Mazi's wife, who is currently detained in Songjiang, is six months pregnant and gave birth at the county hospital a few days ago. The county government specially dispatched Fei Gongxia, a patrol officer of the water patrol team, to Pinghu with a document to welcome the transfer of the criminals. The three bandits and the seized guns and ammunition have been escorted to Songjiang by Officer Fei today. They have been instructed to be temporarily detained in the county prison. The three bandit ships are expected to arrive in Songjiang tonight.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>People's Affairs Department Committee Inspects Water Police</p>
<p>Zhang Jiqun, director of the inspection team dispatched by the Department of Civil Affairs, arrived in Suzhou the day before yesterday and stayed at the Railway Hotel. It was decided that the inspection of the water police of each team in the second district would begin today (the 25th). In order to shorten the deadline, it was decided to divide into three groups to set off and inspect separately. The first group consisted of Zhang Jiqun and Wei Zhanyuan, who inspected teams seven and eight. The second group consisted of Zhang Dong and Gu Yuji, who inspected teams five and six. The third group consisted of Zou Wenxuan and Hui Erfeng, who inspected teams nine and ten. After the inspection of the second district is completed, they will go to Minhang to inspect the water police of the first district.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Wuxi and Cheng Counties Implement Joint Defense</p>
<p>Since the winter defense, each district under the county has implemented joint defense in order to strengthen their strength. Recently, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu believes that this county is adjacent to Jiangyin's jurisdiction, and transportation is convenient. At this time of winter defense, it is urgent to implement joint defense for mutual protection. Therefore, he specially instructed the directors of the fourth and fifth joint defense districts to follow suit and implement joint defense with the police forces of Jiangyin. At the same time, he also sent a letter to the Jiangyin County government, ordering the heads of each district under its jurisdiction to meet with the police chiefs of the adjacent districts in Wuxi to negotiate joint defense.</p>

<p>The Entire City Lowers Flags to Express Sorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai community regards the January 28th Shanghai Incident as the most profound and painful memory of two years ago. In order to mourn the fallen soldiers and the compatriots who lost their lives, it has been decided that on this day, all agencies, organizations, schools, and shops throughout the city will lower their flags to half-mast for one day to express sorrow.</p>
<p>National Goods Promotion Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>The Party, government, and military authorities, according to the instructions of the Central Government, in order to arouse the public's awareness of the Shanghai Incident, stipulated that on this day, local administrative authorities should lead domestic goods manufacturers to hold a National Goods Movement Promotion Week, so that the public would be alerted. However, the local authorities in this city, due to the limited time and insufficient preparation, decided to postpone the National Goods Movement Promotion.</p>
<p>Airplanes Distribute Leaflets</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, the most threatening aspect for our country was the enemy's aircraft. In order to make the public aware of the importance of the aviation industry, the China Aviation Association has reportedly telegraphed the Hangzhou Aviation School to fly the Shanghai Merchant, Shanghai Worker, Shanghai Boy Scout, Shanghai School, Ningbo, and Shanghai No. 1 aircraft, donated by the Shanghai public, to Shanghai at that time, to distribute slogans and leaflets promoting aviation and commemorating national humiliation.</p>
<p>Military and Police Joint Alert</p>
<p>The military and police authorities in this city are deeply concerned that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to disrupt public security on this day. It has been decided that from 5:00 AM, the Garrison Command, Security Office, Public Security Bureau, Security Corps, and other agencies will jointly announce a special alert. Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has already ordered the supervisory departments, detective teams, and district chiefs to be doubly attentive and strictly prohibit all illegal gatherings and parades. The police authorities in the concessions have also decided to be strictly on alert on this day, and will send more detectives to patrol the Japanese areas in Hongkou North Sichuan Road to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition Will Officially Open on "January 28th"</h3>
<p>The Venue is the Open Space on Limma Road, Sixteen Pu</p>
<p>Tang Guanyu Unveils the Ceremony and Invites Participation from All Sectors</p>
<p>According to the Industrial Society, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, in order to commemorate the national crisis of January 28th, expand the promotion of the Women's National Goods Year, and promote the public's understanding of national goods, has specially organized the Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition, soliciting exhibits from member factories. The number of people who have registered in recent days has been extremely enthusiastic. The construction of the venue is nearing completion and is scheduled to officially open on the 28th of this month. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Venue Construction</p>
<p>The association believes that Shanghai South is adjacent to Pudong, the market is prosperous, and the population is dense, making it necessary to actively promote national goods. Therefore, it sent personnel to survey the open space on Limma Road in Sixteen Pu as the venue. Thanks to the enthusiasm for national goods by the Quanzhang Guild Hall, Dada Company, Du Yuesheng, Chen Weifang, Yang Guanbei, and other gentlemen, they generously agreed to lend their support to this grand event. They also consulted with Shanghai Municipal Construction Association Standing Committee Member She Yangeng to design the venue. Yao Guilin of Fuji Construction Company kindly lent materials. The venue is 300 feet long and 150 feet wide, with 140 rooms built in the shape of a trowel, connecting beauty and meeting needs. Zheng Liankun, an architect, is currently supervising the construction, which is scheduled to be completed by the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>Specified Industries</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the venue, it is impossible to accommodate all factories to participate. Yesterday, Director Lin Guyun of the Cooperation Section, together with Standing Committee Members Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Xu Jianruo, and Fang Jiange, strictly specified the industries and participating factories as follows: Silk fabrics 3, Cloth 3, Woolen cloth 2, Cotton knitwear 12, Rubber 4, Leather goods 4, Woolen hats 2, Ties 1, Underwear 1, Lacquerware 1, Oiled paper umbrellas 2, Toothbrushes 3, Candy 2, Food 1, Cosmetics 6, Toys 2, Stationery 1, Silk landscape 2, Jewelry 2, Thermos flasks 4, Combs 2, Mirror box 1, Electrical appliances 2, Flashlights 1, Copperware 2, Glassware 2, Rattanware 1, Bamboo ware 1, Soap 1, Scissors 2, Enamelware 3, Refined steel 2, Pharmaceuticals 1, Pottery 2, Porcelain 2, Raincoats 1, Seasonings 2, Cigarettes 1, Bakelite 1, Tea 1, Entertainment items 1, totaling 48 categories and 124 factories.</p>
<p>Scheduled Opening</p>
<p>In order to give the public a deep impression of January 28th and promote the concept of saving the country through national goods, the association has scheduled the opening ceremony to be held at the venue on Limma Road, Sixteen Pu, at 10:00 AM on the 28th of this month. Sun Daosheng, the director of the Propaganda Section, has designed the decorations. Invitations have been sent to representatives from all agencies, public organizations, and sectors of the city, and Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai, and Ms. Tang Guanyu have been invited to unveil the ceremony to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Reduction of U.S. Cotton Loan: Economic Commission Has No Definite News</h3>
<p>Cotton Yarn Industry Sources Say:</p>
<p>Or The Deadline May Be Extended</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, a United Press International telegram from Washington yesterday reported that Jesse Jones, head of the US Federal Loan Administration, said that the US$50 million US cotton and wheat loan signed by Song Ziwen, the former Chinese Minister of Finance, was originally intended to purchase US$40 million worth of cotton and US$10 million worth of wheat. Since the agreement was signed, China has only used US$7 million worth of cotton. By the originally specified expiration date of July 1st, China is unlikely to be able to use US$40 million worth. Therefore, China and the United States are currently seeking ways to reduce the total amount of the US$50 million loan, etc. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter specially asked Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Commission, about this. Chen was busy with official duties and sent Director Deng to meet the reporter. According to Deng, Chairman Chen had not yet received definite news about the UPI telegram, but had only seen it in the newspapers. The reporter then inquired from sources in the local cotton yarn industry and learned that since former Minister Song went abroad in April of last year to attend the World Economic Conference and signed the US$50 million loan, of which US$40 million was to purchase cotton, with July 1st as the expiration date, only US$7 million has been used so far. This means that by July 1st, there will still be US$33 million worth of cotton that cannot be purchased. The reason is that imports of foreign cotton in our country (including cotton textiles, etc.) amount to 300 million national currency per year, but Japanese and Indian goods account for more than 60% of this. Therefore, it is widely believed that when the July 1st deadline arrives, it will be necessary to extend the deadline, otherwise it will be difficult to purchase the remaining US$33 million worth of cotton. As for the fact that China and the United States are currently seeking ways to reduce the US$50 million loan amount, inquiries from relevant parties in this city, such as the Shanghai office of the National Economic Commission, have all stated that they are unaware of this.</p>
<h3>The Outcome of the Huidefeng Labor Strike Mediated by the Party and Government</h3>
<p>Five Resolutions Decided</p>
<p>The Assault and Battery Section to Be Prosecuted Separately</p>
<p>The Union Announces Resumption of Work This Morning</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, Huidefeng Company, a British firm, recently hired Ni Huiyang as a foreman, who led new workers to drive out old workers, triggering a labor strike. The other day, a violent fight occurred due to the forceful seizure of work, escalating into a bloody tragedy. The union immediately petitioned the Party and government authorities for investigation. After the Party and government authorities sent personnel to mediate, it was decided that work would resume this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Request for the Arrest of the Culprit</p>
<p>All workers of Huidefeng Company, believing that Ni Huiyang, hired by the company, led hooligans to seize work at approximately 6:00 PM the other day, resulting in a tragic fight with many workers injured, were filled with righteous indignation. Yesterday morning, they dispatched representatives, including Zi Ayou, Mao Zhixian, Chen Baofeng, and more than ten others, to petition the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting the arrest of the troublemaker Ni Huiyang and assistance in resolving the dispute. Huang Tiren of the Civil Affairs Department received them and promised to find a way to mediate. They then went to the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center to petition, where Wang Xianqing received them and promised to work with the Municipal Party Headquarters to handle the matter. Party and Government Mediation</p>
<p>Since all workers were forced to go on strike, Ni Huiyang gathered a large number of hooligans at 5:00 PM the other day, attempting to forcibly seize work, which led to a conflict with the workers and a bloody tragedy. The union immediately petitioned the Party and government authorities for investigation. Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters sent Huang Tiren, and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Jintao, to the company for mediation. As a result, the company acknowledged: (1) Ni Huiyang is suspended from his position; (2) Workers will no longer be dismissed without reason in the future; (3) Workers will resume work collectively tomorrow morning; (4) There should be no unjustified strikes; (5) When adding workers, the company will hire those recommended by the old supervisors or foremen. As for the conflict case, it will be legally resolved separately with Ni Huiyang.</p>
<p>Injured Workers Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>During the conflict at 6:00 PM the other day, both new and old workers were injured. The new workers had already been sent by the police to the Tongren and Renji hospitals. The injured old workers included Chai Zhenyu from Cibei, Lu Bingqian from Jiangyin, Shi Heqing from Chongming, and Fu Fuchang from Yuyao. These four were sent to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment by the union yesterday. Ningbo native Zhang Qinghua went missing on the scene, and his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work This Morning</p>
<p>After the Party and government mediation of the labor strike, it was decided that work would resume tomorrow morning. The union issued a special notice to all workers yesterday, stating: Fellow workers, this labor strike and the bloody tragedy that occurred were purely caused by Ni Huiyang's despicable behavior and illegal actions, which we deeply resent. Now, the Party and government authorities have sent personnel to mediate and decided: (1) The company will dismiss Ni Huiyang; (2) The company acknowledges that it will never dismiss workers in the future; (3) Workers must not strike without reason; (4) The added workers will be hired by the company upon the recommendation of the old supervisors or foremen; (5) Work will resume collectively tomorrow morning. Although Ni Huiyang has been dismissed by the company, his destructive actions and daring to incite a crowd to fight are truly lawless. We will petition the Municipal Party Headquarters to inform the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest and bring to justice the ringleaders Ni Huiyang and Niu Qilin, and file a criminal lawsuit in court. We hope that all our members will abide by these decisions and return to work as usual tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning).</p>
<h3>"January 28th" Memorial Day as Mass Mobilization Day for Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Leaflets and Slogans Posted Throughout the City</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee issued four important letters yesterday, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mass Mobilization on "January 28th": The Committee sent letters to various organizations in the city yesterday, stating: With the impact of the "January 28th" incident, the Shanghai market has declined, unable to recover, and it is difficult to maintain. To regulate finance, maintain the current situation, and relieve the people's livelihood, reducing rent has become a way to lessen the burden on citizens. We have convened meetings with various organizations to form the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee. The necessary expenses will be covered by donations of five, ten, twenty, or thirty yuan from various organizations. At the first executive meeting on January 23rd, it was resolved that: (A) The "January 28th" Memorial Day will be designated as the mass mobilization day for rent reduction in the city. At that time, slogans will be distributed, and we request that various organizations distribute them to their affiliated shops and households for posting to promote awareness and achieve maximum effectiveness. (B) The rent reduction movement requires collective wisdom and concerted solidarity. We hereby request that the affiliated branches of various organizations promptly convene citizens' meetings to discuss rent reduction plans. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter. If there is a scheduled meeting, please inform the committee three days in advance so that we can send personnel to participate. In response to the resolutions, we notify your organization to: (1) Allocate the agreed funds immediately to facilitate progress; (2) Distribute and post leaflets and slogans widely to emphasize publicity; (3) Hold a rent reduction meeting as soon as possible to ensure universal participation and demonstrate its popularity. We hope you will handle this promptly for the public good.</p>
<p>Representative Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow: The Committee separately notified representatives of various organizations yesterday, stating: At the first executive meeting on January 23rd, it was resolved that: the principles of rent reduction and important cases for future action should be approved and implemented by the general assembly of representatives of various organizations. We hereby schedule a representative meeting for Friday, January 26th, at 2:00 PM at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's regular meeting room in Tianhou Temple Bridge. We hope that your representative will attend on time to discuss important cases and jointly plan progress. This matter concerns the relief of the people's livelihood, so please do not delay.</p>
<p>Letters of Appointment for Legal Advisors: The Committee sent letters to twenty-seven lawyers, including Xue Du Bi and Ma Junshuo, stating: Our committee is dedicated to upholding the people's livelihood and promoting rent reduction, which is currently actively underway. At the first executive meeting held on January 23rd, it was resolved to establish a legal advisory group and appoint legal experts. We have long admired your profound legal knowledge and sense of justice. It has been decided to appoint you as one of the advisors of the legal advisory group of our committee. We hope that you will agree to take on this role and fulfill your responsibilities in safeguarding legal rights and assisting in the progress of the rent reduction movement, thereby strengthening our public relations.</p>
<p>Letters of Appointment for Secretaries and Staff: The Committee separately sent letters to various secretaries and staff, stating: In accordance with the resolution of the first executive committee meeting on January 20th, you are appointed as a secretary (staff member). We have long admired your enthusiasm for social work. We rely on your efforts to promote the rent reduction movement. Please assume your position immediately to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Goes to the Capital</h3>
<p>Accompanied by Wang Jiazhen and Others the Night Before</p>
<p>Mo Dehui, the former plenipotentiary representative of the Sino-Soviet Conference, arrived in Shanghai some days ago after returning from Europe. It has been learned that Mr. Mo, upon receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the night before, traveled to Beijing with his wife and former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiazhen on the overnight train from Beijing to Shanghai to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He then plans to go to Peiping. Mr. Wang is permitted to return to Shanghai within a week.</p>
<h3>Sun Chuanfang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reportedly a Private Visit</p>
<p>According to Guomin She, Sun Chuanfang, the former commander-in-chief of the Five Provinces Allied Army, has been residing in Tianjin since stepping down and has not engaged in political endeavors for a long time. According to visitors from North China, Sun usually studies Buddhism to occupy his time, stays at home, and avoids discussing politics with visitors. In the spring of last year, he once sought to escape the world and planned to completely abandon his political life, which caused quite a stir in society. However, various parties, considering Sun to be a veteran general in North China, did not want him to remain idle and invited him to come out of retirement, but Sun would only smile and put his hands together in prayer. Recently, after Zhang Xueliang returned to the country, Sun and Zhang developed a close friendship. Yesterday, Sun came to Shanghai from Tianjin to express his welcome and condolences. However, Sun's visit was entirely a private affair. He told people that Jiangsu and Zhejiang were his second home.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Rice Transported to the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Bags Transported in Three Weeks</p>
<p>All Transshipped from Dalian Bay to Various Places</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, China has prohibited the transportation of rice to the puppet state. The customs authorities do not allow any rice, wheat, or flour to be shipped to the northeast coast. The puppet state, lacking food, purchased it from Siam and Annam to compensate. Since the beginning of this year, the customs authorities have lifted the ban on rice exports, and the puppet state has been procuring food from Shanghai. From the 1st of this month to the present, a total of more than ten thousand bags of white rice have been shipped from Shanghai to the puppet state in the past three weeks. Because Andong and Yingkou are frozen, the rice is imported through Dalian and then transshipped to various places in the Northeast. The Dalian Steamship Company has transported the most, and the shipments are still continuing.</p>
<h3>United General Association of Marine Engineers Crackdowns on Unlicensed Seamen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Formal Document Was Submitted to the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>Instructing the Maritime Affairs Bureau to Strictly Comply</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the United General Association of Chinese Marine Engineers in the city, in order to crack down on unlicensed seamen and ensure safe navigation, submitted a formal document to the Ministry of Communications yesterday, instructing the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau to strictly comply. The original text states: Shanghai is a major trading port, with the highest number of ships entering and leaving the country. However, many of the personnel in the navigation and engine departments of various ships not only do not possess certificates or apply for testing but also have crew members with certificates falsely impersonating others. For example, the Longshan vessel of the Sanbei Company, which is exporting this month, falsely used the name of Mao Jietang, who is currently serving on the Shengan vessel, to fill a position. Furthermore, the first and second engineers of the Sanjiang, Fuxing, and Daxing vessels of the Daxing Company, the second engineer of the Beitai vessel of the Beifang Company, and the chief engineer and first and second engineers of the Xinli vessel of the Xinchangtai Company all lack certificates. Such situations are too numerous to mention, and the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau is aware of it but does not take action. Despite repeated requests from the association, they remain the same, allowing them to clear customs and set sail. According to the current laws and regulations of the Ministry, for the navigators and engineers who have not obtained certificates, except for those who have applied for testing within the prescribed time limit and have not yet completed the procedures, they may be temporarily allowed to serve. All others should be strictly cracked down on by the competent authorities by the end of November of last year and not allowed to serve in order to uphold the law. This has already been circulated in the past, but the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau acts arbitrarily, disregarding the law, and it is difficult to shirk its responsibility. Moreover, sailing at sea involves dangerous conditions. In the event of an accident, the lives and property of many people would be lost at the hands of the bureau. Insurance companies can also refuse to pay compensation due to the employment of illegal crew members, indirectly increasing the losses of shipping merchants. The Ministry issued Instruction No. 2789 to the bureau in October of the 22nd year, stating that shipping companies continue to employ such personnel because they have lower salaries. This treats navigation as child's play and should be strictly cracked down on to ensure safety. As for the crew members who have certificates but are unemployed, it is unavoidable in the industry. If they are left idle and scattered, it would be a pity. The bureau should send letters to the marine engineers' associations, navigators' associations, and joint associations in various localities to conduct detailed investigations to find ways to resettle them. This is deeply insightful and takes all parties into consideration. If the bureau had a clear conscience and acted prudently and impartially, how could it have given others cause to criticize and create such a corrupt phenomenon? The association believes that China's maritime administration is still in its infancy, and it is impossible to allow this maritime affairs bureau, which abandons its responsibilities and exists in name only, to set a bad precedent and hinder the future development of the maritime administration. The association cherishes the maritime administration and has sympathy for it. Therefore, we have prepared a detailed document, hoping that you will examine it, conduct a thorough investigation, and strictly punish those responsible, ordering them to strictly comply with the laws and regulations to ensure safety and maintain the maritime administration.</p>
<h3>Second Examination of Chinese and Foreign Seafarers</h3>

<p>Examinations to Be Held Every Three Months Thereafter</p>

A total of 117 people were approved by the examination committee to take the examination. Forty to fifty people who registered did not take the exam, mostly because their ships were in other ports and they were unable to come to Shanghai to participate. If there is a valid reason, they will be allowed to take a supplementary examination. The Ministry of Communications plans to hold an examination every three months thereafter.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Mandates Consumers Bear Unified Tax on Cement</h3>
<p>Construction Association and Others Petition for Exemption from Increase</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Replies Yesterday, Finding It Difficult to Approve</p>
<p>The Shanghai Building Contractors Association and the Shanghai Construction Association previously submitted a joint petition to the Ministry of Finance because the Ministry of Finance doubled the unified tax on cement, and the member construction companies felt unable to bear the burden. They requested the Ministry of Finance to withdraw the order and continue to collect the tax at the original rate. The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday that it was difficult to approve and instructed them to persuade and encourage members to comply. The original text is recorded as follows: Having received the petition, the Ministry of Finance states that the cement tax increase was originally a last resort for the government. At a time when the national treasury is depleted and major construction projects and bandit suppression operations require funds everywhere, manufacturers should make an effort to assist. Moreover, the newly revised cement unified tax rate is uniformly increased throughout the country, and each factory bears an equal burden. Manufacturers are only responsible for collecting and paying the tax on behalf of others, and consumers will ultimately bear the tax obligation, so construction companies should not experience any particular difficulties. As for imported cement, since it must also complete customs duties, how can it be sold at a lower price? This matter concerns a general case, so the request to withdraw the order is difficult to approve. The construction companies are all deeply understanding, so please persuade and encourage them to comply. This is our sincere hope. This batch.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Explains Fee Collection Method for Foreign Language Cipher Telegrams</h3>
<p>Cannot Imitate Domestic Cipher Telegram Fee Collection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Communications, stating that the domestic foreign language five-letter cipher telegram fee collection was higher than international regulations and requested a reduction to benefit commerce. It has now been learned that the Chamber of Commerce received a response from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, which is recorded as follows: Having received the tele message, the Ministry of Communications states that foreign language ten-code cipher telegrams have no meaning and are difficult to pronounce. Telegraph bureau staff find it extremely difficult to transmit these telegrams, and even if the speed is reduced, there is still a risk of errors. The competent authorities of various countries' telecommunications have long discussed abolishing ten-code cipher telegrams. The Ministry also believes that this matter can improve the speed and accuracy of telegram delivery and benefit both the telegraph bureau and the public. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish domestic foreign language ten-code cipher telegrams and replace them with five-code ones when implementing the new regulations of the Madrid International Telegraph Conference this year. As for the five-code cipher telegram fee collection method, the Ministry has carefully considered it before making regulations, and there are various reasons why it cannot imitate the international cipher telegram reduction fee collection. The explanations are as follows: (1) The standards for domestic rates and international rates are fundamentally different. The standards for domestic telegram rates are fundamentally different from international telegram rates. For example, the distance between Nanjing and Peiping is roughly equal to the distance between Nanjing and Nagasaki. However, a foreign language telegram from Nanjing to Peiping only costs 20 cents per word, while one to Nagasaki costs 1.25 yuan per word. If domestic rates were set according to international standards, the current rates between Nanjing and Peiping would have to be increased by at least six times, which is not allowed. (2) Domestic foreign language five-code cipher telegrams should be charged the same as Chinese cipher telegrams to ensure fairness. Currently, domestic telegram rates for Chinese plain text are 10 cents per word for four codes, and for Chinese cipher text are 20 cents per word for four or five codes. This has been in place for a long time and has not caused any inconvenience. The new foreign language five-code cipher telegrams are composed of five Roman letters, and their rates are equal to Chinese cipher telegrams. However, the labor and materials required for transmission are more than Chinese cipher telegrams. If foreign language cipher telegrams are charged at a reduced rate according to international telegram regulations, while Chinese cipher telegrams maintain the old price, it would be unfair to the public sending cipher telegrams domestically. If, therefore, Chinese cipher telegram rates are uniformly reduced, the loss would be too great, which the current depleted telecommunications economy cannot afford. Therefore, the matter of reducing domestic foreign language cipher telegram fees may be realized when the telegram business develops and the economic situation is better, or when Chinese cipher telegram fees are reduced at the same time. However, it is not the time yet. (3) One word in a cipher telegram can replace dozens of words in plain text, and the fees are already very low. Cipher telegrams can use one word to represent dozens of words in plain language. For example, according to the ABC Telegraphic code, the word OPKAH represents "goods advised 'To be delivered free of duty and all charges' Collect duty forward but debit us with delivery charges to the nearest railway station Reference No（｜｜）," which is 27 words, not including punctuation marks. Currently, it is only charged at the rate of one word in foreign language plain text, which is very low. If it is reduced by 40% according to plain language rates, it would be too unfair to senders of plain language telegrams. (4) For the convenience of calculation and fee collection, domestic foreign language cipher telegrams need to have the same rates as plain language. The Ministry of Communications aims to simplify and streamline domestic telegram rates. For example, Chinese plain text is charged at 10 cents per word, regardless of whether it is within the province or across provinces. When Chinese cipher telegrams or foreign languages are doubled, it is convenient. If a separate fee collection method is established for foreign language cipher telegrams, domestic telegram rates will become complicated again, which is not appropriate. In short, the Ministry of Communications manages the national transportation industry and actively strives to facilitate public communication and reduce the burden on the people. In previous months, we launched inexpensive social telegrams, stipulated that incoming telegrams are free of charge, and that Arabic numbers can be used to represent numbers and telephone numbers can be used to replace telegram addresses in translated telegrams. Recently, we implemented new regulations for Chinese telegram addresses, which saves money, and reduced the price of express telegrams, which are all major measures. According to statistics, the implementation of the new regulations for telegram addresses alone will reduce government revenue by 400,000 yuan per year. The reduction in the price of express telegrams will reduce revenue by another 100,000 yuan. The Ministry's emphasis on these public interests and its efforts to facilitate communication are evident to the people. Foreigners account for the majority of users of foreign language cipher telegrams, and the new fee collection method has a minimal impact on Chinese merchants. All the reasons have been stated above. We hope that you will inform the members of the explanation in detail to avoid misunderstandings. This is most important. This batch.</p>

<h3>The Government Subscribes to 50,000 Shares of the China National Products Sales Company</h3>
<p>Approved by the Executive Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Informs the Company for Consideration</p>
<p>The China National Products Sales United Company previously submitted a petition to the Central Government requesting that the government subscribe to 50,000 shares to show its support. It has been learned that it has been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has informed the company for consideration. The original letter states: Having received the letter from the Secretariat of the Central Political Conference forwarded by the China National Products Sales United Company requesting that the government subscribe to 50,000 shares as an example, as was done with the China National Products Bank. The Ministry believes that the company's proposed articles of association and plans are designed to concentrate economic activity in both production and sales and to improve organization, with far-reaching intentions and thorough planning. China's industry and commerce have long been immature, chaotic, and scattered, which is the root cause of economic decline. The company's organization is the first step in cooperation and has the prototype of control, which should be promoted. It was therefore presented to the Executive Yuan meeting and approved that the government subscribe to 50,000 shares of the company to show its support.</p>

All Chinese people share a deep indignation. Fortunately, with the valiant efforts of all generals and soldiers in the campaign, the rebel army has been routed upon hearing the news.

The telegram is urgent, and we look forward to your response with great anticipation. Respectfully, the Sichuan Sui Prefecture Sojourners' Relief Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Ms. Jiang Petitions to Go to Fujian for Relief</h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society politely declines.</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang Yang Tongguan, a famous woman from Suzhou, aged nineteen, volunteered as a nurse with the Red Swastika Society's relief team in the Great Wall area this spring and worked diligently. When the Fujian Incident occurred this time, Ms. Jiang was eager to help and volunteered to join the relief team to work. It is reported that the association has replied with a polite refusal. The original letter replying to the Suzhou Red Swastika Society is recorded below: "To the esteemed Chairman Zhang: We received your letter yesterday, delivered by Chairman Zhang, stating that Ms. Jiang Yang Tongguan intends to join our relief team and depart for Fujian. After public discussion among our colleagues, everyone expressed deep admiration for Ms. Jiang's noble aspiration of offering salvation as a prominent woman from a distinguished family. However, as both our northern and southern teams are departing for the front lines without any female participants, it would be inconvenient for her to accompany the team. Moreover, Fujian Province is mountainous, with difficult roads and thorny paths. Even the relief team must venture forth at their own risk to provide disaster relief in the affected areas. How could we ask a woman to lightly attempt such a task? Should there be a need for female members to assist in the front lines in the future, we will send a special letter to request her assistance to fulfill her great ambition." We are sending this letter in reply, hoping you will convey our message and our sincere admiration.</p>

<h3>Tuberculosis Prevention Association Donates Three Types of Books</h3>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association has been actively planning and implementing anti-tuberculosis measures recently, and the work is extremely tense. However, the association believes that there is still a lack of knowledge about tuberculosis prevention in Chinese society, making it easy to create barriers to implementation. Therefore, it is working together with the Tuberculosis Society to compile and print a series of books on tuberculosis and distribute them widely to society, so that all sectors can have a considerable understanding of the disease, which will help to achieve twice the result with half the effort in anti-tuberculosis work. The books that have already begun to be distributed are: "Tuberculosis Guide," postage fee of two cents, "Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Methods," postage fee of one cent each. For all three types, the postage fee is four cents. Send to the Association at No. 41 Chihama Road, Avenue Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Netherlands Restricts Import of Rattan, Willow, Bamboo, and Grass Utensils</h3>
<p>Letter from the Netherlands Consulate</p>
<p>International Trade Bureau for Reference</p>
<p>According to the Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau, the Bureau recently received a letter from the Netherlands Consulate in Shanghai regarding the restriction of the quantity and value of rattan, willow, bamboo, and grass utensils exported from China. The country recently promulgated new regulations that all imports from various countries to the Netherlands, such as wooden furniture, velvet, leather, electrical utensils, glass, ceramics, and utensils made of rattan, willow, bamboo, and grass, are subject to considerable import restrictions. Of the above-mentioned commodities, China has exports of wooden goods and rattan, willow, bamboo, and grass utensils. There are very few or no exports of other commodities. Only Chapter 1 of the regulations, regarding furniture, is recorded. (1) (2) are as follows: (1) Regarding furniture, (A) the import value of wooden goods or furniture decorations and their parts from various countries shall not exceed 75% of the export value of the same trade goods in any five months of 1931 and 1932; (B) the import value of bamboo, rattan, reed, and wicker products shall not exceed 75% of the average quantity value of the exporting country in any five months of 1931 and 1932; (2) the import value of coarse velvet, silk velvet, wool velvet, and other velvet fabrics and their manufactured products shall not exceed the average export</p>
<p>75% of the quantity value of the exporting country in any five months of 1931 and 1932.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Rickshaw Industry Association</h3>
<p>Discussing How to Deal with the Notice of Suspending the Issuance of Licenses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association held a discussion meeting at its association in Sanminfang, Nanshi at 10 AM the day before yesterday. Because many unlicensed members came to the meeting, some even cried out for relief because the authorities had stopped issuing rickshaw licenses, and their livelihoods had been interrupted. Some棚户 only had one rickshaw, which affected their business and they appealed to the association. The association believed that these people were all poor and ordinary people, and many families relied on one rickshaw for a living. Therefore, it first ordered registration (only those who had legal licenses but were suddenly suspended this time could register), and then the standing committee members Qiu Chunshan, Yu Dajin, etc., comforted them.

<h3>Zhang Yichen et al. Request Strict Punishment for Six Westerners Who Gang-Raped a Chinese Woman</h3>
<p>The New Voice reports that after the news that a Guangdong woman, Ms. Wang Zhang, was gang-raped and robbed by six Westerners after returning from a hui meeting was revealed in the newspapers, all sectors of society were deeply indignant. Zhang Yichen and other members of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession believed that this matter was of great concern to the public order of the Concession and the safety of Chinese women. They sent a letter to the chairman of the association, requesting him to forward it to the Public Works Department to strictly order the relevant police stations to investigate and deal with the matter. The original letter said: "To the esteemed: Yesterday's newspaper reported that Ms. Wang Zhang, a Cantonese woman living at No. 5 Renzhili, North Sichuan Road, was suddenly dragged into the third floor of No. 10, Alley 24, Huade Road, by six men resembling Filipinos at night on the 19th of this month, where she was gang-raped and lost 44 foreign dollars. Although the police station has been investigating, there are still no clues. After reading the newspaper, the colleagues are deeply indignant. This matter is of great concern to the public order of the concession and the safety of Chinese women. Our association, as a group of taxpayers in the concession, cannot but pay close attention to it. We propose that this association quickly send a letter to the Public Works Department, ordering the relevant police station to solve the case within a time limit, or immediately convene the Executive Committee to discuss support methods, so as to maintain good customs and make a severe punishment for the barbarous behavior of people claiming to be from civilized countries. Is it appropriate? We respectfully hope that you will adopt and implement it." To Chairman Wang Xu of the Public Concession Taxpayers Association, members Zhang Yichen, Cao Zhigong, Yu Zhongxian, January 24.</p>

<h3>Unveiling the Inside Story of the Thirteen Thousand Dollar Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Wang Chung-kan Steals a Check</p>
<p>A Russian Forges the Signature</p>
<p>Regarding the case where the Mackenzie &amp; Co. bank was defrauded of $136,688.25 by swindlers using a forged check with the signature of a manager from the British American Tobacco Company, the report from the General Police Station stated that a Russian named J. P. Afanasiev, an employee of the Pu Xi Yanghang, was suspected of being involved in the scheme and was detained at the First Special District Court for interrogation. This was previously reported. Since the Russian's arrest, the police have continued their investigation and learned that another Russian named Ignatieff was also one of the perpetrators. Ignatieff was acquainted with Wang Chung-kan (also known as Wang Hao-ran), a Chinese employee of Mackenzie &amp; Co. from Zhejiang. Before the fraud, Ignatieff had inquired with Wang about the financial dealings between the British American Tobacco Company and Mackenzie &amp; Co. He also asked Wang to let him see the British American Tobacco Company's checks kept in the bank. Wang complied with his request and secretly took a check that had already been paid by Mackenzie &amp; Co. from the safe deposit box and gave it to him. Ignatieff was then able to imitate the signature and forge the check with his accomplices to obtain the large sum of money. However, after the incident, Ignatieff immediately fled and disappeared. The authorities, considering that Wang Chung-kan's irregular actions indicated collusion with the other perpetrators, sent detectives to Mackenzie &amp; Co. yesterday to arrest Wang. Wang confessed to letting Ignatieff inspect the check. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Feng interrogated him. The police lawyer, Li Zhi-shan, explained the case and requested that Wang be detained along with the previously arrested Russian suspect. The court granted the request and ordered the defendant to be detained for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Preparations Were Made Multiple Times Between Hangzhou and Shanghai</p>
<p>Finally, the Abduction Took Place at the Intersection of Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>A Ransom of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Was Initially Demanded</p>
<p>The Gangsters' Interrogation Continued Until Dusk Yesterday Before Adjourning</p>
<p>Tao Chang-hai, a local comprador for Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. on North Sichuan Road, was kidnapped on the night of December 24th last year at 12:10 AM. He was returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou in his own car when he was abducted at the intersection of North Henan Road and Avenue Edward VII. He was held captive in a room on the upper floor of the gang's den at No. 91 Guling Road (North He Road). A letter demanding a large ransom was sent. The case was solved by the entire team of investigators from the Inspectorate General's Office, including Chief Inspector Lu Lian-kui, Detectives Liu Shao-kui and Feng Zhi-ming, and Police Officers Liu Jun-jie and Wu Huan-zhang, at 7:00 PM on the 13th of this month. The victim, Tao Chang-hai, was rescued, and sixteen people were arrested, including kidnappers Xiang Fei-qing, Xu A-rong, Fei Zhu-shi (a woman), and suspects Bao Zu-cai, Xu Wang-shi (a woman), and Tao Wang-shi (a woman). Three pistols, 101 bullets, glasses, iron chains, and other items were also seized. All were sent to the First Special District Court. After Tao Chang-hai detailed the events and identified the defendants, they were ordered to be remanded in custody for further proceedings. The police investigation revealed that seven of the defendants, including Bao Zu-cai, Jiang Yong-xi, Cao Nai-wen, Lu Gui-sheng, Dong Bing-you, Xu Wang-shi (a woman), and Tao Wang-shi (a woman), were not involved in the case and requested their release. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yu-gui, presiding over the Second Criminal Court, continued the interrogation. The police lawyer, Wang Yao-tang, stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that:</p>
<p>The Ring Leader of This Case</p>
<p>Was Named Chen Gui-sheng</p>
<p>In April of last year, Chen Gui-sheng, along with the fugitive Wang Xue-qing and defendant Fei Xiang-qing, plotted to kidnap Tao Chang-hai. Later, Chen committed another crime and was arrested by the French police and sentenced to death by the Second Special District Court. The plan was thus halted. Later, in September, Wang Xue-qing and others continued the plan with the fugitive Tao Yu-tang. Tao Chang-hai often went to Hangzhou for business, and they planned to abduct him near the Gongchen Bridge. The defendants Fei Xiang-qing, Xu A-rong, and Zhou Song-lin went to Hangzhou to wait for an opportunity to act, but due to time constraints, it was difficult to carry out the plan. (Wang Xue-qing lived at No. 3 West Main Street in that area.) They changed their strategy and returned to Shanghai in November. Tao Yu-tang and five others, including Chen De-quan, each contributed 320 yuan and made a down payment to the Pick Company to purchase a Chrysler automobile for the purpose of kidnapping Tao Chang-hai. Tao Yu-tang also arranged to rent a building at No. 91 North He Road from the Union Realty Department at No. 12 Jiujiang Road for 85 taels of silver per month, starting from the first of this month. He asked Mrs. Zhang, the owner of the Wanli Clothing Store in the French Concession, to have her son act as guarantor. The house was prepared to hold the hostage. After everything was arranged, Zhou Song-lin, Zhang Lin-sheng, Zhu Kun-shan, Fei Zhu-shi, and Xu Xue-shi moved into the house one after another. On the 23rd, Wang Xue-qing learned that Tao Chang-hai would:</p>
<p>Return to Shanghai from Hangzhou the Next Evening</p>
<p>Tao Yu-tang then notified Chen De-quan to drive the Chrysler automobile (original license plate number 4306) to the front of No. 91 North He Road and hand it over to the defendant Xu Zhao-fu, the driver, to drive to the North Railway Station. He then used black paper and white characters to change the license plate to No. 8376 and went to the intersection of North Henan Road and Avenue Edward VII. When Tao Chang-hai's car arrived, they blocked its path. Tao Yu-tang, Zhu Xiang-qing, and Xu A-rong, each holding a pistol, forbade any outcry. Tao Yu-tang rushed forward, dragged Tao Chang-hai out, and pulled him into the car. Zhu, Xu, and Tao sat next to him to watch over the hostage. On the way, they removed the fake license plate number, revealing the original number 4306, and drove directly to the gang's den, where they held the hostage on the upper floor of the side room. They put black glasses on him and used iron chains to lock his feet. They forced him to write letters to his family:</p>
<p>Demanding a Ransom of 500,000 Dollars</p>
<p>For His Release, a Total of Five Letters. An Investigation Revealed That Tao Chang-hai Wrote Only One Letter; the Rest Were Written by the Gang Using the Name Wang Tie-min (The Alias Used by Fei, Xu, and Tao). A Person Had Been Sent to Negotiate Twice Before and Received 500 Yuan. Later, on the 13th Evening, While Meeting Again at the Corner of Route Ghisoni and Avenue Haig, They Were Caught by the Police. Now, a Public Prosecution Has Been Filed Based on Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and Article 371, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for the Crime of Intimidation. The Letters, Iron Chains, Guns, and Ammunition Were Presented to the Court for Inspection. The Court Ordered Each Defendant to Be Interrogated Separately. Fei Xiang-qing Testified That in April of Last Year, He Met Chen Gui-sheng in Hangzhou. Chen Proposed Kidnapping Tao Chang-hai and Opening a Cangzhou Hotel. Wang Xue-qing Was Also Present. They Discussed It Once, But Chen Committed a Crime in Tianjin and Was Never Seen Again. In September, He Continued the Plan with Tao Yu-tang and Others. Chen De-quan Was Entrusted to Purchase the Automobile. I Also Contributed 320 Yuan. There Were a Total of Five People Sharing the Cost. The Car Cost a Total of 1,050 Taels of Silver. Tao Yu-tang Rented the House on North He Road for 85 Taels per Month. When Tao Chang-hai Returned to Shanghai, Wang Xue-qing Notified Us.</p>
<p>Tao Yu-tang Retrieved the Guns, and He, Xu A-rong, and Xu Zhao-fu Took the Self-Purchased Car. Xu, the Driver, Stopped the Car at the Intersection of North Henan Road and Avenue Edward VII. Tao Yu-tang Then Dragged the Hostage into the Car. He and Xu A-rong Sat on the Left, and Tao Sat on the Right.</p>
<p>The God of Wealth Resided in the Center, Driving Directly to the House at No. 91 North Henan Road. They Confined Him Upstairs. Tao Yu-tang Asked Someone to Write a Letter to the Victim's Family Demanding a Ransom, Etc. Xu A-rong Testified That in September of Last Year, He Met Fei Xiang at Baoshan Road. He Said That Tao Chang-hai Was a Comprador for Arnhold, Karberg &amp; Co. and Had Money, So They Proceeded with the Kidnapping. Chen De-quan Handled the Purchase of the Car, and He Also Received the Registration. He Contributed a Share of 320 Yuan to Fei. He Had Planned to Kidnap the Victim in Hangzhou.

<h3>Double Suicide by Poisoning at the Old Eastern Hotel</h3>
<p>Zhou Xie-sheng and Zheng Yin-hua</p>
<p>Commit Suicide Due to Weak Will and Romantic Despair</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Couple Arrives</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a young couple committed suicide by poisoning at the Old Eastern Hotel on Zhejiang Road, near the Samma Road. The details are as follows: Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young couple arrived at the Old Eastern Hotel and booked room number 40 on the fourth floor, paying a deposit of five yuan. The man identified himself as Wang Xie-sheng, 24 years old. The woman:</p>
<p>Did Not Leave Her Name. Soon after, they went out together and returned around 6:00 PM, bringing back a large amount of fruit. They ate and talked, appearing very affectionate and showing no signs of distress. Around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, they went out again and did not return to sleep until around 4:00 AM, near dawn.</p>
<p>Instructions to the Tea Boy Before Going to Bed</p>
<p>Before going to bed, they instructed the tea boy to call them after 12:00 PM, saying that they were feeling weak. When the time came, the tea boy routinely inquired whether the guests wanted to extend their stay. He knocked on the door and called out several times, but there was no response. Suspicion arose, and he forced the door open. He saw a couple embracing in bed. He felt them and found that their bodies were as cold as ice and their faces were pale. It appeared that they had committed suicide by poisoning.</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital for Examination</p>
<p>The tea boy immediately reported to the front desk, who in turn reported to the relevant police station. Detectives rushed to the scene and transported the bodies of the man and woman to Renji Hospital in an ambulance. After examination, the doctor determined that they had committed suicide by taking opium paste. The bodies were then transferred to the morgue to await legal examination. A paper package was found in the room, filled with numerous photographs and letters, but no suicide note. The detectives took these items back to the police station for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Description of the Deceased's Clothing</p>
<p>The man was wearing a camel-colored flannel robe, wool socks, and leather shoes, with a felt hat. The woman was in her late teens, with short hair and somewhat attractive features. She was wearing a diagonally striped red cotton cheongsam, a black wool coat with a leather collar, coffee-colored silk stockings, and black velvet shoes.</p>
<p>The Real Names of the Man and Woman</p>
<p>After the incident, reporters investigated and learned that the deceased man was named Zhou Xie-sheng, 24 years old, from Suzhou. He worked as a registration clerk at Chongren Hospital on Six Ma Road, under Dr. Wu Yu-sun. He had previously been a trainee at the hospital before being promoted to this position, earning over 20 yuan per month, which was enough to live on. The woman was named Zheng Yin-hua, only 17 years old, from Ningbo. She was temporarily staying at her sister's Yongcangxiang clothing shop at No. 10 Yuren Lane on Yunnan Road. Her sister was pregnant and due to give birth soon, so she had written to Ningbo, inviting her mother to Shanghai to help with the childbirth. Yin-hua, unaccustomed to rural life, came with her mother. It had only been a month.</p>
<p>The Origins of Their Acquaintance</p>
<p>However, Shanghai was a bustling metropolis, and Yin-hua was influenced by what she saw and heard, becoming increasingly fashionable. In her free time, she often strolled along the nearby streets. One day, she happened to meet Zhou Xie-sheng. They exchanged affectionate words, fell in love at first sight, and swore a vow of love. Since then, the couple was often seen at movie theaters and amusement parks. It is said that Zhou had visited her sister's house once. Recently, due to marriage issues, they committed double suicide by poisoning.</p>
<h3>Two Towboats of the Shanghai-Shasha Shipping Bureau Capsize</h3>
<p>Small Boats Carrying Too Much Cargo Encounter Danger Exporting</p>
<p>Losses Estimated at 14,000 Dollars</p>
<p>Service Suspended to Handle Compensation Procedures</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai-Shasha Shipping Bureau, located west of the Lao Gongmao Steamboat Bureau along the Suzhou Creek bank at Penthang Lane in this city, set out three small cargo boats towed by a small steamboat on the 20th of this month. The boats were fully loaded with sugar and sundry goods. Around 3:00 AM, when the boats were sailing out of the Suzhou Creek towards the No. 1 Wharf of the Dada Company on the outer river, they were struck by a large wave and the towboat hit an iron anchor, causing two of the cargo boats to sink on the spot. The losses are estimated at 14,000 dollars. The details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Established Not Long Ago</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Shasha Shipping Bureau was established less than a year ago. The manager is Jin Hui-dong, and it was co-founded by Qiao Nian-chun, the manager of the Shanghai-Zhang Shipping Bureau, Jin Hui-dong, and merchants from Kunshan, Taicang, and other places. It operates routes from Shanghai to Kunshan, Taicang, Shuangfeng, Zhita, and Shatou. The steamboats used are in cooperation with the Shanghai-Zhang Shipping Bureau. The board of directors is located in the Wantai Sauce Garden in Taicang. It mainly transports goods from various places.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident</p>
<p>This time, it was near the Lunar New Year, and Nanhang shops from Kunshan, Taicang, Shatou, and other places were purchasing New Year goods in Shanghai. They collectively purchased white and brown sugar, seafood, and other sundry goods from Junyi Sugar Shop and other places in this city and entrusted the shipping bureau to transport them. A total of three cargo boats were loaded and towed by a small steamboat. However, the cargo boats were very small, and the goods were divided among the three boats, totaling over 500 packages. At the same time, the shipping bureau's steamboats usually sailed on the inner river waterway of the Suzhou Creek, making navigation easier. On that day, because the Suzhou Creek was silted up and impassable, all the inner river steamboats had to take a detour via the Huangpu River. The shipping bureau thought that the New Year goods were seasonal items that could not be delayed, so they also decided to take the outer river route, hoping to deliver the goods as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Process of Capsizing</p>
<p>However, the driver lacked experience in navigating the outer river. In addition, the weather had been overcast and the tide had been high in the past few days. The tide caught the wind, making the river current even stronger. Therefore, despite venturing out, the boats were only able to reach the No. 1 Wharf of the Dada Company before being struck by a large wave. The cargo boat hit a large iron anchor, and the small boat was overloaded, causing it to sink immediately. Four crew members also fell into the river. Fortunately, police officers from the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team were stationed there. Without waiting for a call for help, they immediately drove a boat to rescue them, and they were safe. The other boat was also saved by the crew and water police. It was immediately driven back to the shipping bureau. The two boats that capsized were only lifted from the Dada Wharf that afternoon. However, the sugar cargo had already been consumed by the fish.</p>
<p>Losses of Over Ten Thousand</p>
<p>After the incident, an investigation revealed that both of the sunken boats were carrying sugar cargo loaded by Junyi, totaling 400 packages. Fortunately, one boat was saved, carrying approximately 100 packages of sugar and sundry goods, totaling 15,000 yuan. Therefore, the total losses suffered were said by people in the shipping bureau to be over 13,000 yuan. It was also learned that Junyi Sugar Shop and others had already received payment in advance. Therefore, the negotiations are being handled directly by the Nanhang shops from Shatou, Hengjing, and other places and the shipping bureau. It is said that the compensation will be based on the original price, with a certain percentage being paid. The shipping bureau will only resume operations after the compensation negotiations are completed.</p>

<p>The Police Are Proceeding in Other Directions</p>
<p>Regarding the incident where Fan Ai-sheng, the manager of Dehe Gongji Indigo Shop and a prominent dye merchant in this city, was forcibly dragged from his hired car at the intersection of Shantou Road and Guangxi Road at 7:45 PM the night before last and forced into a black-plated car with the license plate number 6539, all aspects of the incident have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after Fan's family reported the incident to the police, detectives were dispatched to search for the perpetrators. An investigation into the car's registration number was also launched. After searching all night, it was discovered that the number was forged. The owner of the car is Conner, an American resident of Guofumin Road in the French Concession. Conner has been hospitalized for a long time, and his car has not been used for quite some time. Therefore, the police are currently proceeding with the investigation in other directions.</p>
<h3>Prominent Merchant Bei Run-sheng Entangled in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Accused of Instigating Embezzlement and Other Crimes</p>
<p>Has Been Bombed Four Times</p>
<p>Zhao Ke-qing, a deceased wealthy merchant from Suzhou, opened Qingfeng Yangbu Shop on Nanjing Road in the Guangxu year 15. Zhao Guan-qing, a relative, was appointed as manager. Later, Guan-qing also gathered funds to open Yisheng Yangbu Shop at the front of Qingfeng Shop, which was previously the most famous "Red Fence" among the foreign goods businesses. The shareholders were Bei Run-sheng and the now-deceased Zhao Yu-ting (a cousin of Zhao Ke-qing), among others. Guan-qing also had one share and served as the manager. In the Guangxu year 30, Yisheng Shop was reorganized and soon went bankrupt. Qingfeng Shop was also sealed by the former Mixed Court because it was in the same location. Manager Zhao Guan-qing, believing that shareholders Bei Run-sheng and Zhao Yu-ting's sons, Zhao Zhu-lin and his brothers, should be responsible for the debts under their shares, filed a lawsuit against Bei and Zhao Zhu-lin and his brothers in the former French Concession Court in the early years of the Republic of China, requesting that they be ordered to pay the outstanding debts they were responsible for. During the hearing, Bei denied being a shareholder of Yisheng, claiming he was merely an advisor. At the same time, Zhao Ke-qing's descendants, Zhao Jing-qing and his brothers, also claimed that Qingfeng Shop's funds had been misappropriated by Yisheng, resulting in the sealing of Qingfeng Shop, and they joined the lawsuit against Bei and others. The result was that they were all defeated. Guan-qing, dissatisfied with the original judgment, requested a retrial and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, but his appeal was rejected. Later, through the mediation of friends from both sides, Bei was ordered to pay Zhao Guan-qing 50,000 yuan to resolve the dispute. Now, Zhao Ke-qing's sons, Zhao Jing-qing, Zhao Zhuo-ru, Zhao Zu-zhang, and Zhao Yun-pu, claim that the profits from Qingfeng Shop, which was founded by their ancestors, had been misappropriated and embezzled by the shareholders of Yisheng Shop, Bei Run-sheng, Zhao Yu-ting, and others, with the instigation of manager Zhao Guan-qing, amounting to over 400,000 yuan. Because Yisheng went bankrupt and was sealed, Qingfeng was implicated, and the funds were lost. Zhao Guan-qing sued Bei Run-sheng and others, and Bei twice paid Guan-qing over 100,000 yuan (including the payment in the Republic of China year 17), which Zhao Yu-ting's sons, Zhao Zhu-lin and Dian-chen, handled. However, the funds misappropriated from Qingfeng Shop remained unrecovered, resulting in the loss of the shared property left by their ancestors. Therefore, they have hired three lawyers, Zhang Shi-zhao, Chen Ze-min, and Peng Yuan-xun, to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court, accusing Bei Run-sheng and Zhao Yu-ting's sons, Zhao Zhu-lin, Zhao Pin-hou, Zhao Yin-nian, and Zhao Guo-ping, and Zhao Guan-qing of instigating embezzlement and other crimes and requesting a legal investigation. (The lawsuit is lengthy and has been omitted.) The court issued summonses based on the complaint and scheduled a hearing for yesterday afternoon. The plaintiffs arrived at the court on time with their lawyers, Chen Ze-min. The defendant Bei Run-sheng (accompanied by his self-hired Russian bodyguard and four detectives assigned by the police for protection) and the Zhao brothers arrived at the court with their defense attorneys, Lu Shao-zong, Yu Zhong-luo, Peng Qi, and Jiang Bao-li. However, Zhao Guan-qing was represented by lawyer Li Mian due to illness. At the sound of the third bell, Judge Wu Fang-lian opened the Second Criminal Court for a special hearing. He summoned the parties and lawyers to the court. First, he asked each person's age, place of origin, address, and occupation. Then, Chen, the plaintiffs' attorney, began to state the purpose of the prosecution. Lawyer Li Mian then stated that he was representing the defendant Zhao Guan-qing because Zhao was ill and unable to get out of bed and had only been retained last night and had not yet studied the case. He requested that the court grant a postponement. The judge, considering that the key defendant Zhao Guan-qing was absent, adjourned the hearing. The defendant Bei Run-sheng then stated that although Zhao Guan-qing was absent today, the Zhao Zhu-lin brothers and others were present and could be interrogated. He also claimed that he had no shares in Yisheng and was merely an advisor. This case had been litigated by Zhao Guan-qing for a long time. Initially, Guan-qing negotiated with businessmen, and Zhou Wei-shi and Zhang Lan-ting mediated, ordering him to give Guan-qing 50,000 yuan. In the Republic of China year 20, Guan-qing was involved in litigation again, and the plaintiffs did not participate in the prosecution, resulting in a defeat. Later, Guan-qing requested a retrial, but it was still unsuccessful. The plaintiffs did not request a retrial. Later, Guan-qing appealed, and Du and Zhang mediated, and he paid 50,000 yuan. The case was closed. Now, the plaintiffs have suddenly filed a lawsuit, rehashing old matters, which is completely unreasonable and should be clearly recognized. The judge then questioned the plaintiff Zhao Jing-qing about the circumstances of the defendants' instigation of embezzlement and announced that a further hearing would be scheduled and instructed the plaintiffs that if the defendants filed a counterclaim, they should all appear at the next hearing. After finishing speaking, he adjourned the court. It is reported that Bei Run-sheng's house has been bombed four times this year, and now he is entangled in litigation again, which is truly unfortunate.</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Train Our Brain (II)</h3>
<p>｜｜Answer to Mr. Xu Lezhen</p>
<p>Before answering the several questions you have raised, we</p>
<p>cannot help but express our respect for you. It is very rare that you can so humbly and earnestly examine your past life. However, we also fully agree with your current "hope" ｜｜ "to develop an organized, rigorous, sensitive, and sound mind... to be a person who understands the times." ｜｜ But at the same time, we also have some supplementary opinions, which we will write out for your reference.</p>
<p>First, your "hope" seems a bit removed from practice, presented very abstractly. Of course, your desire to "be a person who understands the times" is very correct, but this conclusion is not derived from your life's struggles or bitter experiences. You only describe "environment" in a few dozen words in your entire letter. The entire letter is about your past reading life, and outside of reading, it seems you have quite neglected everything else. So your reading has become aimless, uncoordinated with real life, and it seems that you have not fully achieved application in every subject; and the categories are also very miscellaneous. Based on the letter, it can be seen that you are too isolated and indifferent to real life, completely trapped in the attitude of a so-called "pure scholar." You want to create yourself as a perfect person first, and then understand the times, or do something (you did not propose this point, but it is my speculation.) This is what we consider a big flaw.</p>
<p>Second, because you have the above concept, you think about "what subjects will make my brain rigorous, sound, sensitive, and eliminate unnecessary fantasies and delusions." This seems perfectly correct on the surface, but after realistic testing, it turns out that this is still a fantasy. Science does have the effect of training a person's brain to be sound, rigorous, and sensitive, but the soundness, rigor, and sensitivity of the brain can only be cultivated in social life, not by relying on science. Science suggests methods, brain training is in use. As for eliminating unnecessary "fantasies and delusions," it is not specifically dependent on reason. There are many theologians here who are also the most imaginative people. Breaking "fantasies and delusions" is only possible in real life, by replacing a loose and idle life with an organized and rational life. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Snow in Tiansi Village</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>"Leveling the rugged roads of the world, flying into the homes of the rich and noble." This is praising the fairness of snow, but the rugged roads, even if temporarily and superficially leveled, will soon reveal their true faces. And before the remaining snow melts, the ice becomes even more slippery and difficult to travel. As for the wealthy families, seeing the snow, they must prepare fine lamb and wine to appreciate it, without feeling the severity of winter at all. Then the so-called "fairness" is only this!</p>
<p>Tiansi Village is a special district of Suzhou, not in terms of administrative rights, but in terms of environment. After we walked through Wangxing Bridge and passed several small shops, we felt suddenly enlightened. The wintergreen trees in front of the John Hall and Boxi Hospital were like Christmas trees adorned with cotton, expressing their pure love. Looking at the white-robed nurses coming and going in the hospital, I wonder if those lying on the sickbeds know that the old sky has brought down heavy snow, and can they struggle to get up and look at the spectacle of city teeth biting the clouds and wild fields planting jade.</p>
<p>Several plane trees at Soochow University, originally as clear and sparse as old men, are now covered with snow, bloated and fat. The withered yellow of the grass has been completely replaced by pure white, and one does not feel the fear of the cold, but only the joy of the stillness. Although the young people are still active, fighting snow battles, most of them are hiding in the house after all. Climbing to the top floor, the "Twin Pagodas" stand side by side in the not-so-distant cluster of houses, as if children were stacking snow for fun. Everything has been added with poetic sentiment and artistic flavor, who has this great game except the old sky? Feeling that "it is not as good as willow catkins rising in the wind," is not getting rid of a girl's careful thoughts. "After the Jade Dragon has fought three hundred rounds, the remaining scales and armor fly all over the sky," is also too disproportionate to be considered heroic. On the other hand, Xiangling's "The towering jade tree has no shadow in the cold, and the fallen silver river does not flow when frozen," in A Dream of Red Mansions, is looking closely at the snow, is writing closely about the snow, especially today's Tiansi Village, which can be described and praised with these two lines of poetry. Because Tiansi Village has countless uneven trees, a vast ground, and a long road.</p>
<p>In Professor Ling's house, under the bright lights, sits an "old tune master" who came through the snow, pouting his flute to wait for Professor Ling to cheer up and sing his "official student" Kunqu Opera from his dantian, and with the flute sound drifting into the snow's enclosure. Then there is "rain silk and wind fragments, misty waves and painted boats." A girl's gentle throat. Ah! Not the evening prayer bell of the chapel, not the biolina and violin, not the song of "Dream Lover," this time of Tiansi Village is ours.</p>
<h3>After the Snow</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The old sky washed away its face full of lead gray, revealing a beautiful face.</p>
<p>A layer of snow piled up on the bridge railing, but it was as thin as frost. The bridge surface was a bit too slippery, people who are young and have good leg strength will not slip and fall, but for an old woman as old and weak as her, whose limbs have been frozen numb, it is really difficult.</p>
<p>An empty body is relatively better. However, she cannot lose the peanut basket on which she depends for life, and she has to hold a broken paper umbrella under her arm, tightly wrapping her own withered body in that thick, dirty, and tattered coat. She takes a step and breathes, and her small feet leave a very obvious triangle on the mud.</p>
<p>Carefully enough, she grabs the bridge railing with her left hand, letting the cold snowflakes stick to the palm of her hand, letting the wild wind blowing from the cold Huangpu River, stab into her skin like a sharp knife. Step by step, panting, she wants to get over this top bridge.</p>
<p>She herself never thought this way: "I'm old, I'm useless."</p>
<p>However, it is true that she is useless, "Ouch," she fell, the peanuts rolled away. Rolled away—the source of her life. Old people are weak, how can they withstand a fall? Once you fall, it is not easy to get up. There is no shortage of laughter around, but there are no arms to help her up. Want to find sympathy in this society? It's harder than finding anything else.</p>
<p>The old woman no longer waits for passers-by to help her, no longer waits for the mutual assistance that should exist between people. She struggles to get up, her hair white, her eyes white.</p>
<p>The basket is picked up, the broken paper umbrella is picked up, and the peanuts in the mud are also picked up.</p>
<p>On the bridge, she raises her thin head and looks at the fish-scale-like snow on the row of foreign roofs, blankly.</p>
<p>She feels that she is standing alone in this blank human world.</p>
<h3>The Furnace is Burning</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>In the severe winter, we are naturally very happy to see the furnace burning. It is its heat that attracts people!</p>
<p>Shanghai's dance halls are all overcrowded. Dancers don't decrease due to the cold weather. The music is sonorous. The dancers embrace the dancing girls, dancing one melody after another. It is their heat that attracts people!</p>
<p>Shanghai brothels and private prostitutes in the mainland have an even better life on winter nights. Outside the window, the snow is white, inside the window, two feelings are intertwined. The two are as hot as fire, how can they know the cold outside the window? It is another kind of heat that attracts people!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Third: The Pain is Unbearable, He Listens Intently to the Music; The Joy is Not Exhausted, Farewell Arrives with a Flying Talisman</p>
<p>Ji Zhi was staring blankly when a messenger from his brother came out of the door. Without waiting for him to speak, he smiled: Look, isn't this a boring act? The messenger smiled: The second master will definitely hold his wedding at a restaurant in the city. Ji Zhi said: Me... Saying that, he smiled faintly and didn't say anything more. The messenger smiled: Look, people are also having a civilized wedding, military band and flower carriage, all here. When Ji Zhi looked forward, wasn't that right? A large group of military bands in red clothes, with big drums and brass flutes, were coming towards the Zhao family's door. At the same time, a flower carriage slowly drove and stopped at the Zhao family's door. Ji Zhi said: This is strange. The groom's family is in this gate, and the bride's family is also in this gate, what is the use of this flower carriage? When he said these words, his voice was a little high. A person near the tea stove walked up and smiled: The second master is short-sighted. The bride's family is borrowing our shop to hold the event. This place only counts as the groom's family. Later, they will send the flower carriage to our side to pick up the bride. Ji Zhi was called out by that person, and when he paid attention, he recognized him as a shop assistant from the milk tea shop. He smiled: You also do this line of business? The shop assistant smiled: Our boss used to do this line of business. There are few events held in the countryside, so he opened a milk tea shop on Haidian Street. Ji Zhi smiled: You are too good at doing business. You have taken on the groom's business, and you have also pulled the bride's family to your place. This way, the groom's family will have to spend more money on the flower carriage. The shop assistant smiled: You are saying the words backwards. People are doing it to show off the flower carriage, that's why the bride's family moved to our place. When I said this, I looked back at the people before whispering: Unexpectedly, the old Yang family's daughter is marrying this Company Commander Zhao. When Ji Zhi heard this, his heart moved, and he smiled at the shop assistant: Your words are a bit inconsistent. You feel that she shouldn't marry Company Commander Zhao, who should she marry then?</p>

<h3>People on the Line of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>The morning air is strangely cold. Although I am sitting in the corner of the wall basking in the sun, I actually don't get any warmth, because the sunlight is pitifully weak.</p>
<p>Peng, peng, peng, a small gong is ringing. One person is leading a monkey, and another person is carrying some of the monkey's things. They are knocking and walking in the alley, but not a single child comes out to watch the fun. The two monkey performers want to leave, but they stop again. They are patiently waiting, hoping for unexpected audiences and unexpected gains.</p>
<p>But it is cold, and it is morning. The children are hiding indoors. Although there is the enticement of the gong, they are still unwilling to go out. The monkey performers have no choice but to leave in disappointment, with lonely hearts and lonely sorrow.</p>
<p>For the sake of life, they have no choice but to brave the morning cold to move around, going east and west to attract young audiences. Undoubtedly, they are people on the line of bitter struggle.</p>
<p>Suddenly, here comes the mother and daughter who pick up garbage. The mother is a middle-aged woman over fifty years old, but the daughter is only a little girl of twelve or thirteen years old. The mother and daughter are quickly rummaging through the garbage can. Perhaps because it is early in the morning, the waste in the garbage can seems to be very rich. The mother is boldly opening the bottom door and hurriedly picking up what seems to be satisfactory. But unexpectedly, an old man who lives nearby walks up, loudly scolding them and driving them away.</p>
<p>The mother and daughter are still reluctant to leave, but the old man goes outside on his own. So, the daughter is patrolling, and the mother is still picking up garbage. But it seems that the fate of the poor is always bitter. The old man comes back from outside again. The mother receives the daughter's notification, and the mother and daughter hurriedly leave with their baskets. I am very upset, even the poor don't have the freedom to pick up garbage.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the mother and daughter also feel deeply saddened when they leave. The mother is so calm, and the daughter is so well-behaved. But for the sake of life, they cannot but endure the contempt of people and do that humble business. Undoubtedly, they are also people on the line of bitter struggle.</p>
<h3>Movie Star Interview</h3>
<p>— Yun Yan</p>
<p>I had wanted to meet Ms. Hu Die, the renowned figure in the movie industry, for a long time. However, despite several attempts, I hadn't been able to. The gatekeeper of the Star Film Company, an old Shandong man, was very courteous. Otherwise, for a down-on-my-luck person like me to visit such a beautiful woman of the times would truly be an intrusion upon Xi Shi [a legendary beauty]. Luckily, he was very kind and gave me a courteous reply. Yesterday, I was strolling aimlessly in the snow and ended up on Rue Dupleix. My feet knew it, and I found myself at the gate of the Star Film Company. I asked the old Shandong man again if Miss Hu had returned. This time I was truly fortunate. He said, "A car just went in. Go to the waiting room yourself, and someone will attend to you." I quickly went inside, announced my name, and asked for directions. Soon, a bright-eyed, white-toothed lady stood before me. Her face showed signs of travel, and it was clear she had just returned from a long journey and hadn't yet reapplied her makeup. I bowed and offered a few words of admiration, to which she responded with a gentle smile, revealing dimples from time to time. Later, I asked about her trip to Nanjing. She said, "I was very nervous. I am grateful for the support and applause of the audience in the capital, and I barely managed to avoid embarrassment. However, we took the night train back, and it was raining heavily and very cold in Nanjing. Many of us who went together caught colds. Some had runny noses, and some had chills and fever. I also have a headache and fear of the wind, so I just want to go back and rest..." And so, I took my leave.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Reports</p>
<h3>Let Me Also Talk About Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Jiren sent me a book on goldfish breeding. After reading it, I became very interested and would like to talk about goldfish as well, to join the fun. Goldfish are a variant of the crucian carp, so they are also called gold crucian carp. Su Shunqin wrote in a poem: "Waiting for gold crucian carp by the bridge." In ancient times, keys were shaped like fish. Li Shangyin also had the line, "Firmly locking the osmanthus grove with golden fish locks." The other day, at the banquet of my old brother Jianwei at Yantang [Smoke Bridge], Zhuo Dai said, "Scatter silkworm eggs on new bricks and dry them in the hot sun, then throw them into the water, and they can turn into goldfish." But he only heard this from others and hasn't tried it himself. This year, he plans to try it in the pond of Lao Pu, and I don't know if it will succeed.</p>
<p>Among goldfish, there is a type called pearl scales, which is rarely seen in the world. The head is as red as a crane's crest, and the tail is as warm and moist as jade. The body is covered with small, protruding scales, each one round, as if wearing a pearl shirt. Mr. Fang Tiaochen of Dingyuan has a poem that says: "In my pond, clear and rippling, there are swimming fish, carefree. One fish has red scales, white on its ridge, another has speckled spots like hanging stars. Among them, one fish is truly outstanding, with small scales protruding, round like pearls, clearly revolving one by one, with silver threads running around its body. Its jade tail is long, reaching its shoulder, and it swims with a large belly, how convenient. Even more amazing, the fish's forehead is red and fresh, the color like coral, round like a coin (omitted below)." This poem can be included in a fish-raising manual. I wonder if this pearl scale species exists in the Fish Paradise?</p>
<p>In "Treatise on Superfluous Things," there are three sections on fish-watching water tanks, which should be adopted for raising goldfish: "Watching Fish: It is best to get up early, before sunrise. Whether in ponds or basins, fish all swim in clear springs and green pools. Also, on cool, clear nights with a moon, reflections are inverted in the waves, and from time to time, startled scales splash, awakening the eyes and ears. As for a gentle breeze rustling, making a harmonious sound, or after a rain, new water rises, with ripple patterns crinkling green, these are all good times to watch fish." Second, "Siphoning Water: Changing water in a basin every day or two will result in a greasy residue accumulating at the bottom. It is best to use a section of Xiang bamboo to make a siphon to remove it. If you don't siphon it out in time, the color will not be fresh and beautiful, so it is impossible to store it in a good fish pond." Third, "Water Tank: There are ancient bronze tanks, large enough to hold two dan [a unit of volume] of water, green all around. People in ancient times did not know what they were used for, but they must have been for pouring oil into to light lamps. Now, taking them to store fish is most ancient. Next, use porcelain from the Five-Colored Imperial Kiln, pure white ones are also acceptable. However, you must not use the flower pots fired in Yixing or the vulgar style of seven-dan cow legs. The reason I list this is really to prepare a kind of refined object to play with. If you must follow the diagram, it would also be conventional."</p>
<p>Li Huangpi has been gone for many years. I still remember that after he stepped down from the political stage, he lived in Tianjin, and gardens, flowers, trees, concubines, and sensual pleasures were his entertainment in his later years. A certain concubine, a Southerner, was inherently quiet. At flowery mornings and moonlit nights, she often lingered between the wind corridor and the water pavilion, so those who presented strange flowers and exotic plants from all directions were ordered by her to be planted by the gardeners, or they presented many goldfish, all top-quality dragon species, with protruding eyes and beautiful colors, and long fins and tails. The concubine loved to play with them, and a special Hao Pavilion was built to place the fish tanks. One day, the goldfish were suddenly caught and eaten by a lion-shaped cat. This cat was raised by Madam Wei, Huangpi's beloved concubine. The concubine did not know, and because she loved the goldfish, she crushed the cat to death. Madam Wei's maid ran to complain to her mistress. Madam Wei was furious and insisted that Huangpi deal with the concubine. However, the concubine argued that the cat had killed many goldfish, so it deserved to die. Each held their own views, and Huangpi repeatedly mediated, expending much effort. The concubine was ultimately a newcomer, and everyone sided with Madam Wei, saying: Eating fish is the nature of cats, and the concubine did not use other methods to stop it, but resorted to cruel means, which was unreasonable. The final solution was to kill all the goldfish in the tank to sacrifice to the cat. Although Madam Wei's anger subsided, the concubine was extremely angry and refused to eat. Huangpi secretly promised to buy her good fish again, and she barely managed to drink some porridge. A trusted actor said to Huangpi, "It is difficult for fish to be between two hates." He added, "It is difficult for a husband to be between two loves," which made Huangpi laugh.</p>

<h3>Educational Status of Anhui Province (4)</h3>
<p>｜Inspection Report by Special Commissioner Li Ximou of the Ministry of Education｜</p>
<p>(Ji) "Implementation Status and Opinions of Those in Charge of the Provisional Regulations for the Graduation Examination of Primary and Secondary Schools." When the high school entrance examination was held, disputes arose. However, the results were still implemented according to the original plan. The examination system has both advantages and disadvantages, and everything depends on how the authorities use it. Before the entrance examination in Anhui Province, each subject first drafted several preparatory questions, which was criticized by many people. In fact, this situation is common in most provinces, and the method should not be too strict at the beginning of the entrance examination system. If young students are motivated to study because of the entrance examination, then the examination system has achieved its goal. (The Provincial Education Department has prepared various statistics on the entrance examination situation in primary and secondary schools, which are omitted here.) The opinions of the person in charge of the province regarding the entrance examination are summarized as follows: (1) Handling the entrance examination affairs is extremely complicated, and it is even more difficult to hold them in a centralized manner. The complexity of the procedures, such as the allocation of examination papers, examination questions, and examination venues, is beyond words. The waste of time and money is secondary. In order to make it easy and convenient, the procedures for reporting from various schools should be simplified, but this kind of decentralized method seems to be easier on a small scale. The examination time should also be advanced, preferably in late May, because it is too hot in July, the government office hours are shortened, and students gather in large numbers, which can easily cause diseases. (2) The entire province should use the same teaching materials, and it is appropriate to designate reference books for examination questions, so that students can have a basis for practice. When creating questions, it is appropriate to create more essay questions and fewer test questions. The questions should focus on the big picture and emphasize understanding, while avoiding unnecessary memorization. There should be a large number of questions, more than ten in each subject, so that the teaching materials covered are wider and there is an opportunity to choose answers. (3) In calculating grades, daily grades should not be included to avoid malpractice. (4) The re-examination method is cumbersome and inconvenient to handle. Students also feel that there are many difficulties in waiting for the re-examination, which is very costly, and because the time is tight, the traffic is</p>
<p>inconvenient, which hinders the college entrance examination. The method should be improved urgently. (5) In the organization of the graduation examination committee for primary and secondary school students, in addition to the assistant examination committee members, there should be chief examiners and invigilators. The chief examiners should be responsible for the chief examination affairs in each district, the assistant examination committee members should be responsible for drafting questions and grading papers, and the invigilators should be responsible for invigilation. (6) Primary and secondary school graduates often prepare for the entrance examination day and night, and work too hard, which affects their health. The development of primary school children is not yet complete, and the harm is even greater. (7) All parties in the province believe that after the department holds the high school entrance examination and grades are determined, it takes time, and it is difficult to handle the re-examination, and the candidates also feel that waiting for the re-examination is costly, and because of the urgency of time, the traffic is</p>
<p>inconvenient, which hinders the entrance examination, and methods should be sought to provide relief. According to the department's opinion, this article should be changed to the regulations for high school students' entrance examination in accordance with Articles 64 and 65 of the High School Regulations, and students who fail to pass all subjects in the examination should not graduate. If there are subjects that fail in three or more subjects or only two subjects fail, but the subjects are any two of the four subjects of Chinese, English, mathematics, and nature in junior high school, or any three of the five subjects of Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, and chemistry in high school, the students should repeat the grade for one year. If there is one subject that fails or although there are two subjects that fail, but the subjects are not as stipulated above, the students should be ordered to take a re-examination once. However, these students may be issued a certificate by the department and bureau to take the high school or vocational school examination first. After being admitted, they will be treated as probationary students, and after participating in the next graduation examination, they will be given a graduation certificate after passing the re-examination of the failed subjects, which can only be used as a formal student after verification by the school where they studied. (8) Students' families and society support the examination system, but because of the phenomena and problems described in item 6, there are many requests to improve or abolish the primary school entrance examination method, and at the very least, it cannot be consistent with the high school entrance examination method, and there are many suggestions for holding an examination for university graduates in order to standardize the level of university students.</p>
<p>(9) Free methods, scholarships and improvement suggestions. In addition to scholarships for studying abroad at public expense and scholarships from domestic universities, normal schools and women's vocational schools are exempt from tuition and meal fees, and vocational schools for men and women are exempt from tuition fees. The intention of this scholarship and free method is good, and the initial effect is also great, but after a long time, the situation of the times has changed, and the drawbacks have arisen, and it seems necessary to revise it. The various scholarships and free methods are listed below: (A) "Provincial Primary and Secondary School Free Method", (1) Free method for students with excellent grades. Each student in the province's high school pays 20 yuan per year for tuition, 10 yuan per year for junior high school, and 3 yuan per year for senior primary school. It is now stipulated that there are three free places in each class, and those who are ranked in the top three in the total average of each semester are exempt from tuition fees. (2) Method of exempting tuition fees for students in disaster areas in the 22nd academic year. The province has a method of exempting tuition fees for disaster areas such as Liu'an, Huoshan, Huoqiu, and Fuyang this year. All students in the province's provincial high school whose families in their original place of origin have been directly harmed by bandits and are unable to pay fees can be exempted from tuition fees with proof from the county government of their original place of origin. However, this method is temporarily limited to this year. (B) "Methods and quotas for scholarships abroad." It has been found that the province has always had a subsidy item for students studying abroad at their own expense, which is listed in the province's local budget. In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China, due to the determination of the regulations for studying abroad, this subsidy item was changed to a scholarship, and eleven regulations for scholarships for Anhui students studying abroad at their own expense were formulated and reported to the provincial government and the Ministry of Education for record. This scholarship stipulates that there are seven countries with vacancies: (1) The United Kingdom has a fixed quota of eight, with each student receiving 8 pounds of English money per month. (2) Germany and Austria have a total of 13, with each student receiving 120 marks of German currency per month. (3) France and Belgium have a total of 22, with each student receiving 500 francs of French currency per month. (4) The United States has 12, with each student receiving 40 US dollars per month. (5) Japan has 15, with each student receiving 40 yen per month. The total amount is 70, and the annual cost is approximately 97,000 yuan. () The scholarship for each student is approximately half of the provincial expenses.) The procedures for checking and supplementing should be based on the regulations that students who have been admitted to a famous university for one year and have excellent grades must also submit a certificate of academic performance issued by the president of the school and a self-filled registration form to the department for review and registration. After confirming the vacancy, it will be submitted for summary review and supplement, and the scholarship will be issued from the month it is approved. It has been found that the Ministry of Education has ordered all provinces to revise the existing regulations for scholarships for students studying abroad at public expense and at their own expense. Since public-funded students need to take preliminary and follow-up tests to show seriousness, it seems that students studying abroad at their own expense should also be tested in China. The province now plans to set the amount of each scholarship according to the talents needed by the province, and set the questions according to the examination method for public-funded students (emphasizing science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine). After the department passes the examination, it will report to the Ministry of Education for record, and ask for the issuance of a study abroad certificate, allowing them to study abroad, and then change the name to half-public-funded students, and the monthly tuition fee will be issued at half the rate of public-funded students. (Regulations will be formulated separately.) (C) "Loans from various counties". The province had previously issued repeated orders to stop the practice of students' subsidies and sightseeing fees from various counties, as it hindered the progress of local primary schools. Later, the counties reported that many of the students from the counties studying at various universities were poor, and asked for separate regulations to be issued to provide university students with loans. The department considered the matter to be feasible and approved the request, and ordered the formulation of loan methods to show restrictions, but this kind of regulation is based on local financial resources. If funds are not sufficient, it is still not allowed to be established. In fact, it is different from scholarships and subsidies in name, and the designated funds are limited, so it does not seem to have much to do with it. Counties that have established loans include Liu'an, Wangjiang, Shitai, Fuyang, Suxian, Qianshan, Taihu, Mengcheng, Fanchang, and Dangtu. (D) "Scholarships for domestic universities." Eleven regulations have been formulated regarding the method of awarding scholarships to domestic universities, which can focus on academic performance and subjects. Unfortunately, special consideration for poor children has not been specifically mentioned, which seems to be a shortcoming. The Anhui Education Department has scholarships for students studying at domestic universities, including 35 quotas at Central University, 2 at Shanghai Medical College, Shanghai Business College, (3), Zhongshan University, (2), Peking University, (8), Beiping Normal University, (10), Peking University Engineering College, (5), Peking University Agricultural College, (2), Peking University Medical College, (3), Peking University Law School, (3), Peking University Women's</p>
<p>College of Arts and Sciences, (5), Peking University Business College, (2), Peking University Art College, (2), Tsinghua University, (10), Beiyang Institute of Technology, (6), Wuhan University, (12), Zhejiang University, (3), Tongji University, (5), Jinan</p>
<p>University, (3), Hangzhou Art College, (1), Music College, (1), Jiaotong University, (10), Jiaotong University School of Civil Engineering, (5), Jiaotong University Beiping Railway Management College, (3), Nankai University, (5), Fudan University, (5), Guanghua University, (4), Daxia University, (4), Yanjing University, (5), Union Medical College, (2), Jinling University, (12), Nantong College Textile Department, (2). Each of the above receives 110 yuan per year. (E) "Suggestions for improving free and scholarship policies." The Education Department has the following suggestions for improving the scholarship and free methods: (1) The number of free places should be the same throughout the province. Each county's senior primary school should stipulate the number of free places for students with excellent grades. Provincial high schools (normal and vocational schools have no tuition fees) should be stipulated by the province. The number of free places should be determined by examination results. This free place is mainly to exempt tuition fees, and other expenses should be paid as usual. (2) Poverty scholarships should be established. Counties should set up poverty scholarships, limited to senior primary schools and junior vocational schools. The province should set up poverty scholarships, limited to secondary schools and vocational schools. Provincial universities should also set up poverty scholarships. This scholarship is divided into half-fee and full-fee (including tuition, meals and accommodation fees. (3) Students with poverty scholarships should be strictly examined to obtain them, and they should be strictly managed when they enter the school. (4) Students with scholarships to study abroad should also obtain them through examinations. (5) Domestic scholarship students should be effectively managed by the original school to determine performance standards.</p>
<p>(10) Inspection Notes. School inspections, regarding books, instruments, classrooms, cleanliness, etc., which are superficial are obvious. Regarding teaching methods, moral education guidance, and the school spirit, it is not easy to be accurate about the impression unless a long period of inspection is obtained. This inspection in Anhui only lasted for more than 20 days, and it is inevitable that it cannot be detailed. Schoolwork, the situation of the school, the advantages and disadvantages of the teaching methods of teachers, etc., are all based on the impressions obtained by chance in a very short period of inspection. It can be imagined that it is rash. The following kinds of things are all offered in good faith, and please do not criticize them with malice. As the saying goes, only good people can accept all words, which is what is hoped for the educational authorities of Anhui Province. (The original report lists the situation of the schools inspected, which is omitted due to space limitations.) (End)</p>

<h3>Chinese Cultural Advancement Association Holds Inaugural Meeting of Promoters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan and others were elected as preparatory committee members.</p>
<p>The preparation time is limited to two weeks.</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Advancement Association, initiated by Chen Guofu and others, held an inaugural meeting of promoters at 2:00 PM yesterday at No. 66 Hankou Road. A preparatory committee was immediately elected to organize the preparatory committee and be responsible for the progress of the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Promoters present: There were more than 100 people, including Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Tong Xingbai, Ding Mocun, Tao Baichuan, Guo Wei, Ye Xiufeng, Zheng Zhengqiu, Shao Zuiweng, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Bai, Zhou Feicheng, Huang Zaoxiong, Yuan Xueyi, Xu Xingchu, Chen Jicheng, Xu Zexiang, Xue Guangqian, Tang Zengshou, Xu Shaodi, Chen Baohua, Zhang Zhengfan, Long Tiyao, Fang Huanru, Wang Xinming, Huang Xianggu, Kang Xuanyi, Huang Hao, Li Shiqun, Zhou Yuying, Yuan Yeyu, and Tang Huiping. Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, etc. were unable to attend due to attending the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee.</p>
<p>Chairman's report: The meeting began at 2:00 PM. Guo Wei was elected as the temporary chairman and Xu Xingchu as the recorder. After performing the etiquette, the chairman first reported on the situation of the initiation, followed by Pan Gongzhan's report on the significance of organizing the Chinese Cultural Association. He briefly stated that the standard of a country and nation in historical events is based on culture. The foundation of political economy and all undertakings is culture. The construction of all undertakings depends on the spirit, and the power to encourage this spirit is the greatest with culture. Culture not only expresses thoughts, but also transforms thoughts. Therefore, the transformation of human life is all based on culture as the original driving force. Since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, there has been a great revolutionary movement, and the power of its occurrence is due to the fact that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, since the founding of the Tongmenghui, has been engaged in ideological transformation and guidance, giving the nation a new life and strength. In other words, culture is the basic strength to promote it. However, because in the process of revolution, most people pay attention to politics and military affairs, and ignore culture, those in society who are committed to cultural undertakings have embarked on the road of politics and military affairs, so the reactionary factions seize the cultural tools by chance, so the revolutionary forces are developing day by day, and the reactionary propaganda of the Communist Party is also spreading day by day, especially in recent years. Therefore, we initiate this meeting to promote and revive the national culture on the one hand to build our theory, and to eliminate the reactionary theory that does not meet the needs of our country on the other hand.</p>
<p>Election of the Preparatory Committee: Then discuss the matters. (1) It was decided that the number of preparatory committee members should be 11, and Pan Gongzhan, Ding Mocun, Guo Wei, Jiang Jianbai, Zheng Zhengqiu, Tong Xingbai, Zhu Yingpeng, Li Zhiyun, Zhu Yinong, Fang Huanru, Chen Bai and other 11 people were elected as preparatory committee members, and Ding Mocun and Guo Wei were the conveners of the preparatory committee. (2) The task of the preparatory committee is to be responsible for all the progress from the closing of the initiators' meeting to the establishment of the general assembly. (3) The declaration of the association will be temporarily based on the origin of the creation, and the initiators can submit written opinions to Mr. Ding Mocun to the preparatory committee within five days. (4) The preparation period should not exceed two weeks at most. (5) All those present today and the initiators published in the previous newspapers are</p>
<p>the initiators of the association. After the meeting, the meeting was adjourned and the photos were taken.</p>
<h3>Successful Resolution of the Jinda Disturbance</h3>
<p>Acting President Shen Pengfei to Arrive in Shanghai to Assume Duties Soon</p>
<p>Students' Attitude Has Softened, Expressing Welcome to Shen</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The disturbance at National Jinan University, since its occurrence, has lasted for a month now. The Ministry of Education has already decided on a solution, sending Zheng Hongnian to Nanyang to inspect overseas Chinese education, while school affairs will be managed by Shen Pengfei, Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, as acting president. The students' attitude has become more moderate and they welcome Shen. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Education: Zheng Hongnian received Instruction No. 789 from the Ministry of Education on January 23rd, stating, "You are hereby assigned to Nanyang to inspect overseas Chinese education and raise funds for National Jinan University. This order is to be followed." It is reported that Shen will arrive in Shanghai soon to take over duties, and since he cannot handle the duties of Director of the Higher Education Department concurrently, Minister Wang will appoint someone to act in his place temporarily.</p>
<p>Letter from the Board of Directors: The Jinda Board of Directors sent a letter to Zheng Hongnian yesterday, stating, "Respectfully informing you that the Board of Directors of this school held a meeting on the 19th of this month to discuss and resolve the disturbance, deciding to send President Zheng to Nanyang to inspect overseas Chinese education and raise funds for Jinda. During your absence, please have the Ministry of Education send someone to maintain school affairs. Regarding the students who initiated this disturbance, please have the Ministry of Education investigate and deal with them strictly." It is hoped that this letter, along with the recorded details, will be reviewed. Respectfully, Sun Ke, Standing Director.</p>
<p>Student Expression: The school's student organization to protect the school and expel Zheng will convene a meeting today</p>
<p>in the morning and plans to hold a</p>
<p>general student assembly tomorrow to discuss everything. It is reported that the students are satisfied with the Ministry of Education's decision and their attitude has softened. They also welcome Director Shen's acting presidency, so the school disturbance can be considered over.</p>
<p>Zheng's Remarks: According to Zheng Hongnian's remarks to reporters yesterday,</p>
<p>"Since the disturbance occurred at Jinda, I have stated to the Board of Directors that I will (1) not interfere, (2) not resign, (3) not take leave, (4) not recommend someone to act in my place, and (5) not want the school to be dissolved. Now, the Ministry of Education has assigned Director Shen to act as president. Shen has many years of experience in education and should be able to handle it with ease. I have already sent a telegram to welcome him. The faculty and staff whom the students wanted to expel have also resigned from their positions. This matter can be considered over. I hope the students will focus on their studies and make up the exams. All handover procedures within the school were completed ten days ago. From now on, I will not manage school affairs in any way and hope that no one, whether from inside or outside the school, will come to discuss school matters with me again. As for the Ministry of Education sending me to Nanyang to inspect overseas Chinese education, I was not informed beforehand and have no intention of going at present."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Shanghai's Four Night Schools to Stop Enrolling New Students</h3>
<p>Orders Schools to Close in Phases</p>
<p>There is no Immediate Closure</p>
<p>Regarding a news item about the Ministry of Education ordering Shanghai Jiang, Chi Zhi, the School of Law and Political Science, and the Business School to stop running night schools, it has been learned that the Ministry of Education, considering the establishment of night schools, has many inconveniences in terms of military training and student self-study, so it has ordered the schools not to enroll new night school students or transfer students from the next semester. As for current students, the schools will close in phases, and there will be no problems with the qualifications of current students. As for whether the schools receiving the order are limited to the aforementioned four schools, this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Educator Yang Pingyu Passes Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Pingyu, former section chief and supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, and former professor of the Second Jiangsu Provincial Normal School and principal of the attached elementary school, served in the education field for more than thirty years. His scholarship and morality were admired by society. Due to old age and declining health, he passed away from illness at 6:00 AM on the 23rd of this month.

<h3>County Elementary School Mandarin Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau, taking advantage of the winter vacation, has scheduled a three-day Mandarin exhibition for all elementary schools in the county from today (the 25th) to the 27th, held at the Beiqiao Elementary School in the new county seat. After drafting plans, designated schools in each district were asked to prepare and collect exhibits from various schools and send them to the venue. Yesterday, the bureau sent staff to arrange the exhibits from the schools in each district in the east and west classrooms and the assembly hall of Beiqiao Elementary School. There are dozens of exhibits from each school, such as diaries, notebooks, novels, stories, poems, letters, dictation, phonetic symbols in large and small characters, as well as reading methods, teaching methods, composition teaching, calligraphy, etc. for elementary and advanced Mandarin courses. They are all excellent works from various schools. The bureau has also hired judges to review them starting today, so as to select the best for awards to encourage them. At the same time, schools will notify their students to visit the venue.</p>
<h3>Zhu Mingxin Discusses the Situation of Gansu College</h3>
<p>Zhu Mingxin, Dean of Gansu College, came to Shanghai on official business the other day. According to him, this trip to Shanghai represents President Wang Jinghuai in raising books from major bookstores. He has already contacted various bookstores and achieved good results. The managers of the bookstores, recognizing the backwardness of culture in the Northwest, have all agreed to donate. When asked about the Ministry of Education's reorganization of the college, he said that this concerned the internal organization of the college. Because the college's organization still used the old system, which was largely inconsistent with the ministry's orders, the outline was re-established and submitted to the ministry for approval. However, the outline took too much into account the local situation, which led to its rejection by the Ministry of Education. In fact, the college had already implemented all the points indicated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Nankai Alumni in Shanghai Host Banquet for President Zhang Boling</h3>
<p>Zhang Boling, President of Tianjin Nankai School, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd evening due to school affairs, the details of which were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The Nankai Alumni Association of this city held a banquet at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao at 5 PM the day before yesterday to welcome him. More than a hundred alumni of the school attended. During the banquet, Zhang gave a speech, saying that he had been greatly stimulated by observing current affairs in recent years. After introspection, he believes that the greatest concern of our country is that everyone cannot abandon their personal opinions and unite and cooperate. The nation has reached a critical juncture of life and death. If we do not wake up, we will be eliminated by the world forever. His words were filled with emotion. Then, Zheng Tonghe reported on the recent work of the alumni association. It was decided on the spot to raise scholarship funds for the alma mater, plan a meeting place, and compile an alumni directory. After the banquet, a movie was filmed to commemorate the occasion. The gathering ended happily at 8 PM that night.</p>

Yang Weiyu serves concurrently as the principal. Teaching and management are strict, the curriculum is practical, and ability-based classes are implemented, with emphasis on individual teaching. It has been well-received by society. Now, because the original rented school buildings are insufficient, it has moved to a new campus at No. 561 La Fei De Road, west end of Lu Ban Road. The architecture is exquisite and the campus is spacious. Its complete facilities are rare among private elementary schools. Enrollment is scheduled for February 2nd and school starts on the 3rd. Boarding students are also being accepted.</p>

In the future, transferring to that school will have special advantages.</p>

<h3>World Sprint Phenomenon Tolan Gives Up Athletic Life</h3>
<p>Feeling the Pain of Unemployment</p>
<p>Determined to Work Hard</p>
<p>World sprint phenomenon, African-American Eddie Tolan, will announce his retirement and no longer appear on the track, determined to work hard at his profession. Tolan is the Olympic champion in the 100m and 200m. He studied medicine at the University of Michigan. His retirement from the athletic field is not due to any particular dissatisfaction, but simply to find a job. Last autumn, he sought jobs everywhere but failed. Therefore, he had to return to his hometown of Tiddeloa. The second day the Olympian arrived home, he encountered a welcoming band and his cousin Footland. Foot is a laborer. Tolan was so touched by the scene that he thought that although his cousin's position was humble, he had a job, while he could not even support his parents. Completing his medical studies would only be interrupted, and becoming a famous doctor would only be a dream.</p>
<p>After graduating from the University of Michigan for four years, he became a world sprint star. The day before participating in the Olympic preliminaries, he wrote to his mother, saying that if he became a champion, the family's situation could gradually improve from then on.</p>
<p>Now Tolan has found a place. As a secretary in an agency, he has somewhat fulfilled his wishes. Eddie told people, "I am confident that I will no longer race. From now on, I will work hard at my profession. The walls of gold and silver medals, is that all it is worth?"</p>
<h3>West Youth Basketball League, Liangjiang Beats Southeast A</h3>
<p>｜Twenty-Five to Fifteen｜</p>
<p>Too Many Fouls Detract From the Performance</p>
<p>Four Players From the Liangjiang Team Were Sent Off</p>
<p>The results of last night's West Youth women's basketball games showed that the Liangjiang beauties continued to win. Liangjiang defeated Southeast A 25-15. The American women defeated the Red team 25-22. In the game between Liangjiang and Southeast, the fouls on both sides were countless. As many as four players from the Liangjiang team were sent off. Two players from Southeast were also sent off, making it almost impossible to form a team with so few people. The results of last night are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Liangjiang Wins Southeast A 25-15</p>
<p>(2) American Women Win Red Team 25-22</p>
<p>(3) McLing Wins Yellow Team 17-12</p>
<p>(4) Green Team Wins Elementary 50-8</p>
<p>The game between Liangjiang and Southeast A was greatly marred by too many fouls on both sides, and the interest was also silent. In the last quarter, almost all of Liangjiang were substitutes. Yang Sen, Chen Rongming, Chen Baixue, and Shi Ruixia were all sent off one after another. Fortunately, on the Southeast side, main players Liao Zhuyuan and Li Yinan were also sent off, and their fighting power was also weak. Otherwise, Liangjiang would have suffered an accident. The large number of players sent off set an unprecedented record in women's basketball games. Initially, Pan Meng scored first, opening the record. Liao Zhuyuan scored one point on a free throw. Liangjiang took the lead 2-1. Liangjiang continued to score five points. Southeast remained the same. After 10-4 in the first quarter, Southeast relied on Liao Erfeng to enter and exit the basket and chased to 12-10, only two points behind. Unfortunately, it stopped again, and at 17-10, Yang Sen was sent off. At 19-10, Shi Ruixia was also sent off. The first half ended at 21-11, with Liangjiang taking the lead. Starting in the second half, Southeast could not take advantage of Liangjiang's wavering opportunity to attack, and its own fouls were also numerous. At 22-11, Southeast's Li Yinan and Liao Zhuyuan were also sent off. At 25-11, Chen Rongming was sent off. In the last eight minutes, Southeast was still sluggish, even though the opponent was all reserves. The result was a 25-15 victory.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's West Union Group A Football Match, Wah Sazes Wins Navy Nine to One</h3>
<p>Yesterday there was a West Union Group A football match between Wah Sazes and the British Navy, held at the racecourse. As a result, Wah Sazes won nine to one.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Port Trial Match</h3>
<p>Four to Four Draw</p>
<p>｜Shanghai Is Unprepared, Strange｜</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 21st Dispatch) The Tianjin Football Association held the third port trial match at the British stadium this afternoon, divided into red and white teams. As a result, both sides scored two goals in the first and second halves, resulting in a 4-4 draw. (Note: The Red team is the official port team.)</p>
<p>Red Team Lineup</p>
<p>Martel Silver Dailo Sun Sijing Hair Luo Kexibao</p>
<p>Jiang Lu Aqier Robes Tof Er Jones Finn Garis</p>
<p>White Team Lineup</p>
<p>Mosass Dikaofu Brown Bo Ang Villi Mi Xia Liang Suofu Yong Kao Lost Mingzong Dailei Fo Ai Sang Thomas Bai Di (Top) Tolan Neif (Bottom) Rogers</p>
<p>Overall, the worst player on the port team was center forward Robes Tof. His footwork was unreliable, he rushed forward randomly, and he delayed many good opportunities. In this reporter's opinion, he has no qualifications to represent the port team. Aqier, in the left inside forward position, is quite worthy of being appointed. Jiang Lu on the left wing is also good. Johnson was unable to attend due to illness, but can also play the center forward position. I believe that Johnson as the center forward, Aqier as the left inside forward, and Jiang Lu on the left wing would make the forward line more complete. Defender Silver also has minor flaws and is slower to move. Brown and Fei Yuehan in the military team are both better, but are limited by regulations. Brown, Liang Mingzong, and Villi Suofu in the White team are all good and are promising talents for next year's port team.</p>

<h3>Report on Vocational Education from the Ministry of Education Commissioner's Trip to Europe (11)</h3>
<p>(5) School Visit Records</p>
<p>French vocational education observation locations: Paris, Nancy, and three locations in Lyon. Lyon is France's largest industrial area, so vocational education is quite developed. In terms of population, Lyon ranks second in the country.</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>(1) (Paris Municipal) This school is a vocational school under the Paris municipality.</p>
<p>Established in 1886, it mainly teaches furniture manufacturing, divided into two departments: 1. Furniture Department: (1) Cabinet making, (2) Table making, (3) Wood carving, (4) Curtain weaving. 2. Metalworking Department: (1) Sculpture, applied to bronzes, gems, jewelry, etc., (2) Model making. The workshop area within the school</p>
<p>is 4,800 square meters. Facilities include drawing and sketching studios, woodworking and metalworking shops, and various manufacturing equipment workshops. The equipment is very new and complete. Education focuses on students' aesthetic training, so that the structure of patterns can be unique and different from the mundane, while being pleasing to the eye. For each item of equipment</p>
<p>manufacturing process, it must begin with a pattern, from the pattern to material selection, from the material to color matching, and then to completion. Therefore, it is innovative and practical. Admission requires an examination, including subjects such as French, calculation, and drawing. Admitted students are all primary school graduates, and some have studied in higher primary schools. The age is about 13 to 14 years old. The course is divided into three years, with examinations every year. Those who fail are asked to withdraw from school. Excellent graduates who wish to stay at school for further study have a special class in the following year. Currently, 40% of graduates stay at school to attend the fourth year of classes. Each week's coursework is 54 hours. The morning is for general education and engineering theory classes, and the afternoon is for workshop practice, accounting for 30 hours. Workshop practice instructors are allowed to hold concurrent positions outside the school that are related to their duties. School workshop practice strives to match factory conditions, so when students use machinery in practice, the time required for each action must be recorded by the students. This is a common key point in the training of French apprentice schools. The school is responsible for introducing students to employment, so the principal has close ties with the factory sector, and it is easier to help students find employment.</p>
<p>Three-year graduates are given a Certificat d'Apprentissgelh rh . Graduates are awarded a Diplome. Students residing in Paris are free of charge, while those residing in the suburbs pay 300 francs per year, and students from other provinces pay 700 francs per year.</p>
<p>(2) School of Book Trades. This school is run by the Paris Municipality and is a world-renowned school for printing and bookbinding. Established in 1889, it was initially very simple, but gradually developed. It now offers 15 vocational courses related to the book trade, with the aim of training skilled workers specializing in book trade crafts. Admission requirements are primary school graduation, but students must pass an entrance examination, aged 13 (4) to 17 (8) years old. After graduation, a apprentice certificate is given. The instructors in the school are selected through open competition, regardless of nationality, and are all experts in art and crafts. The entrance examination subjects are (1) dictation, (2) arithmetic, (3) sketching, and a medical examination to determine whether they are suitable for vocational work. At the beginning of admission, students are required to tour various workshops to choose the one they like, and given a few days of trial learning to determine their suitability based on their skills and work. Poor students are exempt from lunch fees, subsidized by the city council. For poor children with excellent grades, living expenses are also provided. Students residing in Paris are also free of charge, while those residing in the suburbs are given 300 francs per student per year with the approval of the local council, and students from other provinces pay 600 francs per year. The school's curriculum emphasizes both theory and practice, especially focusing on patterns. Lithography, wood carving, leather decoration, cork carving, copper engraving, etc., all use patterns as a basic subject. However, those who study other professions also pay attention to geometry and color science. Practical subjects account for 30 hours per week in the first year, 33 hours in the second year, and 36 hours per week in the third and fourth years. Those who fail the year-end exam are asked to withdraw from school. Employers and workers in the printing industry are represented on the examination committee. General subjects include history, geography, national language, science (physics and chemistry), mathematics (arithmetic, algebra, geometry), accounting, outline of laws, outline of rational factory organization, history of art, sketching (plaster, objects, human body), plant and animal research, decorative construction, etc. The courses are as follows: 1. Lithography, divided into four subjects: color printing, lithographic patterns, stone carving, and lithographic plate making. 2. Sculpture, divided into four subjects: wood carving, copperplate engraving, soft paste engraving, and plate making. 3. Photography, divided into three subjects: photography, photographic plate making, and color portraits. 4. Bookbinding, divided into two subjects: installation and leather decoration.</p>

<p>Words of Contribution</p>
<h3>To Enthusiastic People from All Over the Country Who Support Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang Yi</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods is not limited to one corner, but requires efforts from all over the country to be effective. This year has been officially designated as the Women's Domestic Goods Year, and many people say: "This year, it seems only the people in Shanghai are putting in effort, while people in other places are still silent. Is this year Shanghai's Women's Domestic Goods Year?" The reporter was stunned upon hearing this, but later thought that the women's domestic goods movement indeed had the shortcoming of not being widespread. I think men and women from all over the country must also be thinking: it is clearly the national Women's Domestic Goods Year, why is it only lively in Shanghai? Will the other places simply not respond and give up? If there are passionate people with vigor and perseverance, they will definitely not stand idly by, and even more certainly will not be indifferent. I believe that local propaganda movements in various places are certainly important, but the most practical method is to establish domestic goods companies, serving as the central hub for promoting domestic goods in practice. Currently, the China National Products Company has a national joint office established at No. 1 Yuanmingyuan Road, and is in the process of separately contacting people from all over the country to establish China National Products Companies. All methods are very comprehensive, and there are detailed standards for all metropolitan areas and major trading ports. Therefore, I would like to introduce it below, hoping that enthusiastic people from all over the country will unite and open such domestic goods companies that benefit both themselves and others. In our ideal, at least 20 domestic goods companies should appear across the country this year.</p>
<p>Design Table for China National Products Companies in Various Locations</p>

<p>Domestic Goods Talk</p>
<h3>Women's Year for Being Scolded</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ai Ci</p>
<p>Opening up various newspapers regarding "Women's Domestic Goods Year", it seems that the authors are standing on a battle line, launching a general attack on the women's community: saying that last year's "Domestic Goods Year" had no results, and it was all the result of women not using domestic goods, and there is a statistic that 1.4 million foreign imported lipsticks and perfumes in ten months, to prove women's extravagance. If this kind of style does not change, I think it is better to rename it as "Women's Year for Being Scolded" rather than "Women's Domestic Goods Year", which would be more straightforward.</p>
<p>Men and women are all citizens. The name "Women's Domestic Goods Year" is fundamentally humorous. When it comes to domestic goods, no one can deny that we use domestic goods for all our clothing, food, housing, and transportation. There is almost no one, how heartbreaking to say! Does the infant formula eaten by children one day after birth have domestic goods? Is everyone's clothing entirely domestic goods? Are the houses we live in and the appliances we use all domestic goods? The more convenient the transportation, the more railways, highways, and airways are opened, are the trains, cars, and airplanes completely domestic goods? Do you know how much money was sent to foreign countries in the "National Salvation Through Aviation" movement? I think do not use the number of 1.4 million to create the data for the "Women's Year for Being Scolded", because this is not the fundamental way to promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>I remember someone said, "Europeans and Americans create, Japanese imitate, Chinese do not create", but now we can be slightly optimistic: there are indeed many imitations. Go into the domestic goods company and see, aren't there good achievements on display? Originally, as long as it is Chinese capital and Chinese manufacturing, even if the raw materials are completely foreign goods, it meets the prescribed standards for domestic goods. Shouldn't it be considered patriotic to buy and use them? The manuscript paper I am using now is also a domestic product, produced by Tianzhang, but someone said: "You are not completely patriotic if you think like this. Do you really know that no foreign raw materials are used? The more you promote domestic goods with foreign raw materials, the more money flows to foreign countries, isn't it? This is just a difference between fifty steps and a hundred steps." Of course, there is probably no country in the world that is self-sufficient in raw materials, but now the country that relies on foreign supply of raw materials the most is probably us. We can imitate, which is a step forward. I hope the production sector will take another step forward, seek self-sufficiency in raw materials, create completely domestic goods, and the selling price can be cheap, and more people will definitely buy it; otherwise, it will be useless to set a "×× Domestic Goods Year" every year!</p>
<h3>Love and Respect Local Goods and Thoroughly Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>Since the sounds of cannons at Beida Camp, the Chinese people have competed to think of ways to resist. The airplanes in Shenyang were seized, so they resisted with over-mountain guns and grenades, with rifles and machine guns, and finally advocated resistance with broadswords, and even with stones. China's armed resistance gradually promoted local goods. In my opinion, this armed resistance must use the latest and most modern methods. Airplanes, poison gas, artillery, submarines, tanks, etc., these are modern methods of resistance. If these methods cannot be adopted, it is better to honestly not resist.</p>
<p>As for economic resistance, it is very different. Economic resistance is promoting domestic goods. The more local, the better, the more local, the more wonderful. The benefit and wonderfulness of Gandhi in India lies in weaving local cloth, three big characters. Japanese industrial manufacturing is already feared by Western countries, but the country still desperately uses local goods. Our Chinese manufacturing industry is not yet developed. If all the things needed for clothing, food, housing, and transportation do not use the original local goods of this country, it will absolutely not be able to be self-sufficient. For example, in clothing, if you don't wear silk or local cloth, then you must wear foreign goods or Sino-foreign hybrids. For example, in food, if you don't eat granulated sugar, you must eat Japanese white sugar. (Very few Western goods recently) For example, in housing, if you don't want to live in Chinese-style houses constructed of cedar wood, you will definitely live in Western-style houses constructed of foreign pine. I am not opposing Westernization, but I am saying that while China's industry is not yet developed, please Westernize slowly. If everyone can recognize the principle that the more local, the better, you must first have a heart of loving and respecting local goods. In this way, even if you cannot localize everything into domestic goods, you can at least resist some foreign aggression. Fortunately, this kind of victory is as sure as can be. Without a doubt, one point of local goods has one point of benefit. In short, the more local, the more victorious. Therefore, I say that armed resistance, the more local, the more it fails. Economic resistance, the more local, the more it succeeds.</p>
<p>The people of Guangdong are most stimulated by foreign countries. They were also the earliest to promote domestic goods. The slogan they used at first was also to promote local goods. Please take a look at the Sincere and Wing On department stores on Nanjing Road, isn't it clearly written that they sell both foreign and local goods?</p>
<p>Women's Talk on Domestic Goods</p>
<h3>Telling Sisters the Enthusiasm for Promoting Domestic Goods Fifteen Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Pan Yin Ge</p>
<p>When the author was the principal of a commercial school in his hometown in the seventh or eighth year of the Republic of China, I was very enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods at this time. I advised students to purchase and use domestic goods, and at the same time organized domestic goods stores to sell domestic goods. I set an example myself, not only wearing clothes made entirely of domestic goods, but also using domestic goods for everything in my home. There was a ridiculous thing at the time. That is, I even lit an old-fashioned vegetable oil lamp to read at night. Not only did I not use electric lights, but I did not use Mobil oil lamps. I had a very persevering thought in this. At that time, I was affected by the European War on the one hand; and stimulated by Japan's "self-sufficiency" doctrine on the other hand. At that time, I saw a story about the copper king Torawiemon in a Japanese magazine. Although this Torawi-san was a wealthy man in Japan, his personal life was very frugal. He used an old-fashioned wind lamp to read at night. This biography also praised him for having "unyielding integrity". And there was a photo, which was a picture of Torawi-san sitting on the ground, reading by the wind lamp. The author admired it very much after reading it. So I changed to using the most authentic domestic product - vegetable oil lamps - to read at night. At that time, I also read the story of Gandhi in India while reading. Gandhi resented that India's transportation equipment was taken over by the British, so when he went out, he didn't talk about efficiency, but still rode in an old-fashioned Indian wooden boat. At that time, the author wrote an essay in a magazine in his hometown, promoting domestic goods. There were two sentences in the middle that quoted the above two stories. He said: "When learning from Torawi's wind lamp, reserve strength before it is too late. Do not be like Gandhi's wooden boat, leaving regrets after it is too late." Although the sentences were not well written, it is conceivable that the individual believed in and the determination of the idea at that time.</p>
<p>Such a rustic person later came to Shanghai to work, and was stimulated and besieged a lot, and some things gradually invaded my body, such as felt hats and Serge. Shanghai people's worship of foreign goods and contempt for local customs and goods are indeed the best in the country. This is the illusion created in the past ninety years or so since the opening of trade. Last year, the promotion of domestic goods was named Domestic Goods Year. Although men were not specified, men probably have a greater responsibility. The result of the promotion is very ashamed. According to the statistics from January to October, the import surplus has exceeded 600 million yuan. This year is the Women's Domestic Goods Year, and the focus of this responsibility has turned to the general sisters. Let's see how the statistics will be next year. It's dangerous!</p>
<p>Older ladies can keep some old habits. Young girls will do as their mothers and sisters do. Therefore, the focus of Women's Domestic Goods Year is more on middle-aged sisters. How to break the illusion of the past ninety years and do our best to promote the purchase and use of domestic goods is indeed the greatest responsibility of our sisters this year.</p>

<h3>Women Should Do Some Serious Work</h3>
<p>— Jing Cun</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the women in the Women's Domestic Goods Year should not only be consumers of domestic goods, but also producers of domestic goods. However, the current ladies and young ladies think that it is a humiliating thing to directly participate in the production of domestic goods. It is impossible no matter what. Even if it is possible, they are not willing to do it no matter what. I firmly believe that the women in the Women's Domestic Goods Year, if they cannot directly or indirectly participate in or assist the domestic goods production business, do not deserve to be called a woman in the Women's Domestic Goods Year, and they are sorry to the society for this year's respect for women. At the beginning of the Domestic Goods Year, I once asked the women of this year to show their spirit and make some achievements to show women's ability and comfort the society's desire. Afterwards, I proposed a slogan for women to participate in the domestic goods production business as this year's work goal for women. Now, January of the Women's Domestic Goods Year is gradually passing, where are the achievements that women have shown? Is the Women's Friendship Conference the achievement of the Women's Domestic Goods Year? Is it the achievement of the Women's Domestic Goods Year to ask a lady to ride a horse and direct the procession of the Domestic Goods Movement Parade? Is it the achievement of the Women's Domestic Goods Year to invite one or two socialites to open the Domestic Goods Bazaar or Exhibition? This is not it, that is not it, so what is the real achievement of the Women's Domestic Goods Year? Please write down a few points that I thought of for a while:</p>
<p>(1) All married men dare not buy any more foreign goods to avoid their wives' scolding.</p>
<p>(2) Children all know that using domestic goods is the responsibility of citizens, and buying foreign goods is the greatest shame of a citizen.</p>
<p>(3) The fashionable ladies and young ladies cannot find any imported goods on their bodies, in their houses, or in their stomachs.</p>
<p>(4) Knowledgeable women should use their time for meetings and socializing in factories to educate female workers and guide female workers to improve their lives.</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>(5) Women of the bourgeoisie should save their decoration fees and entertainment fees and invest in domestic goods factories.</p>
<p>(6) By the end of the year, the import surplus figures in the customs report will be reduced by several digits, and the import quantity of cosmetics will be almost zero.</p>
<p>(7) The newspapers publish news of the emergence, development, and expansion of small-scale family industrial organizations every day.</p>
<p>(8) The number of women waiting to be hired in Shanghai's employment agencies is gradually decreasing. Some are absorbed by domestic goods factories to take on jobs, and some return to the countryside to engage in their rural side businesses.</p>
<p>The above eight points are the achievements that I temporarily thought of for the Women's Domestic Goods Year. Maybe some people say that I take this Women's Domestic Goods Year too seriously. I also admit that I think that since it is stipulated as the Women's Domestic Goods Year, we should take it seriously and do some work. One of the biggest problems of our Chinese people is that we are not serious, so nothing is achieved. If everyone works seriously, I think the above eight points are not difficult to achieve. If everyone is unwilling to do it seriously, and still cannot show some achievements by the end of the year, I would like to suggest changing "Women's Domestic Goods Year" to "Women's Show-off Year", and ask the local collaboration association and several groups to retroactively recognize it, in order to match the name with the reality.</p>
<h3>A Few Words to the Ladies</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Ladies! Young ladies! Please look at the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>I don't know from which year onwards, these blue-eyed children, dwarfs, they all took a fancy to us, opened our doors, and shipped their surplus goods into our country in large quantities. At the same time, several larger places and trading ports have become their dens for肆意搜刮. Buildings with more than a dozen floors. Buildings that are already towering high. They are foreign firms, foreign banks, and factories set up by foreign businessmen in China. They are all places to search and scrape our blood and sweat. In this way, year after year, tens of thousands of dollars flow from our pockets. Torrentially rolling to foreign lands.</p>
<p>Next, those foreign businessmen who set up factories in China, their capital is surplus, they have identified the things we need and lack, and they quickly find ways to manufacture and operate, and use our country's cheapest wages and raw materials, and rely on unequal treaties as护符, in this way, they have already taken the initial advantage.</p>
<p>Going a step further, they push these goods into our large companies and stores, relying on our many foreign goods salesmen to promote them. Let's not talk about anything else, let's just look at Nanjing Road, which is full of foreign atmosphere, how many large companies selling foreign goods are there? When the sun sets and the lights are lit, a group of fashionable girls, when their wives come out of the company, it can be said that everyone is holding their beloved foreign goods. We are promoting them hard, but you can always see them - the magnificent洋房 in the western suburbs of Shanghai. Which house is not a paradise for them to search our blood and sweat and enjoy it? Of course, we can also think that the cars that are running rampant on the road are all ridden by foreigners, and it is not only civilians who bow and smile at foreigners, but also politicians and important people.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is because we ourselves are not competitive, there is no need to say much. So, let's not talk about other years. In the Domestic Goods Year, a new record of an import surplus of 90 million yuan was revealed.</p>
<p>Our ladies, when you read the above words, you can be angry. Good! This year is the Women's Domestic Goods Year, and it is the time for you to contribute. Just hurry up and catch up. There is still nothing to worry about in the past. Ah! Get up!</p>
<h3>How to Make the Women's National Products Year Work</h3>
<p>— Dao Er</p>
<p>Last year was the National Products Year, but the customs deficit was still 410 million. Moreover, the domestic market was worse than in previous years, and people's purchasing power was exceptionally weak. However, so much money still flowed abroad to purchase foreign goods. If all 410 million had been used to buy domestic products, domestic factories would undoubtedly be more developed.</p>
<p>The reason why domestic goods cannot sell well now, as everyone knows, is largely due to the dumping of foreign goods. But we should also carefully study why foreign goods can make Chinese people willing to buy them. In general, people who are willing to buy foreign goods do not really want to send money to foreigners, nor do they necessarily hate and reject domestic goods. It is only because foreign goods are more beautiful and cheaper in style, while domestic goods have fewer designs and are more expensive, naturally attracting people to buy foreign goods instead of domestic goods when making purchases.</p>
<p>Some people say that buying foreign goods leads to money outflow, so it is better to buy domestic goods, even if the quality is worse and the price is higher, as the money remains in the country. Buying domestic goods is a national obligation and can even be said to be national morality. However, this is just a theory, and the reality is different. Because everyone's economic situation is different, if they can buy better things at a cheaper price, they will not care about domestic or foreign goods. Moreover, there is no law stipulating that buying foreign goods is a crime, so we can only persuade people to buy domestic goods, but not prohibit them from buying foreign goods. If domestic goods have good styles, good quality, and are plentiful, and the price is cheaper than foreign goods, then naturally there is no need to persuade people to buy them, and they will sell well naturally.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that the Women's National Products Year's promotion of buying domestic products is still a passive way of promoting domestic products, rather than an active one. If we want to actively promote domestic products, we should find ways to urge domestic factories to work hard to improve their products, help them design and implement ways to reduce costs and lower prices as much as possible. On the other hand, we should also investigate all kinds of foreign and domestic goods, make a comparison table of their quality and prices, and give it to domestic factories to study how to make them as good as or even better than foreign goods. At the same time, in addition to reducing the cost of labor and materials, we should ask the government to reduce the tax rate on domestic goods, and domestic goods will naturally be welcomed by everyone. Generally speaking, the biggest disadvantage of domestic goods now is the lack of variety and the fact that their appearance is not as beautiful as foreign goods. This is the biggest reason. If we study this first, at least we can make the more affluent Chinese people adopt them first. There is already an example of this. Like the silk fabrics of the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory, they produce a lot, and the quality and style are better than foreign goods, and the price is low. Recently, their two-three spring style Luo Na silk has been bought by many Chinese women, and many foreigners also buy it. This shows that the first thing for a product to sell well is to have excellent quality. There is no need to repeatedly declare that it is a domestic product to attract others to buy it. If domestic goods do not improve quality and reduce prices, even if they are promoted as much as possible, or even if people give speeches to people in various countries saying that Chinese people must promote domestic goods and buy domestic goods, the effort will be twice the result.</p>
<p>This year is the Women's National Products Year. It would be best to ask those who are enthusiastic about the women's national products movement to first study the items used by women and how to improve or increase the styles of certain domestic products to a degree that suits women's preferences and uses. The second step is to find ways to reduce prices within the possible range. This is a very valuable and practical job!</p>

<h3>National Products and the Cultivation of a Sense of Duty</h3>
<p>— Nie Zeng Jifen Nie Qijie, narrated</p>
<p>Today, the national affairs have declined to such an extent, and it is undeniable that the people lack a sense of duty. In general, officials have more intention of making money and less intention of fulfilling their duties, which I think is also a common feeling among ordinary people. Generally speaking, people today have a sense of suspicion towards the government and all public institutions. To go a step further, people's trust in each other is also weak, and they fear that the entrusted matters will not be handled faithfully. This is also a feeling that everyone has, which is also very sad. The progress of any progressive country does not only rely on perfect laws and regulations, but also on a large number of people with a spirit of responsibility to promote and benefit them to the fullest extent. Otherwise, even if there is a method of governance, it is equivalent to a mere formality. The so-called spirit of responsibility is the sense of duty. The people's sense of duty cannot be instilled suddenly, and there must be a method to cultivate it. Chinese doctrines since ancient times have emphasized this point everywhere. In short, it is to make society often have the concept of valuing righteousness over profit. In terms of division, each individual has their relative duties, which can be summarized by the five relationships, which is actually the responsibility to the entire group. For example, loyalty is for the ruler because he represents the entire group. Mencius's words on the righteousness of the ruler are the clearest: "A person who is cruel and tyrannical is called an ordinary man. I have heard of the execution of the tyrant Zhou, but I have not heard of the assassination of a ruler." Also, "The people are most important, and the ruler is least important." Therefore, loyalty to the ruler is loyalty to the group. Confucius said, "The ruler treats his ministers with courtesy, and the ministers serve the ruler with loyalty." Therefore, serving the ruler with loyalty has certain conditions, which must be within the scope of seeking the interests of the people. Promoting loyalty and righteousness is a good way to cultivate a sense of responsibility. For example, our society worships Guan Yu and Yue Fei. Those who read their books will naturally be inspired by the idea of defeating enemies and eliminating traitors. The north values chivalry and has thick customs, which is greatly influenced by this. Filial piety is for parents, which is also to correct the human weakness of valuing rights and neglecting obligations. Everything from pregnancy, nurturing, care, protection, education, and even marriage is done by the parents. When people grow up and become independent, they easily forget the past favors they have enjoyed, just like those who borrow money in society. At the time, they beg in every way, and when they get the money, they thank them a thousand times. But when it comes to repayment, even if they are rich, they often try to evade the debt, and often go to court. Another example is officials who only care about getting money and do not try to be competent, which is the same mentality. Ancient philosophers realized that humans have the same weaknesses, and believed that social order cannot be maintained by laws. It is necessary to cultivate everyone's sense of responsibility from an early age, so that they know that those who enjoy must repay. Therefore, they specially rewarded filial piety and punished unfilial piety. The state made it into law, and society formed clear opinions, and the effect was very obvious. There is an ancient saying, "Look for loyal ministers in the homes of filial sons." Looking at history, there has never been a filial person who was a corrupt official, and there has never been anyone who was filial to their parents and harmed the people. Why? They have a full sense of responsibility, despise rights and value obligations, so they can be incorruptible in the face of wealth and not avoid danger in the face of difficulty. Those who want to overthrow filial piety today have not thought deeply about the overall interests. Fidelity is for husband and wife, which is also an important matter for cultivating a sense of responsibility. Generally speaking, at the time of engagement, vows of eternal love are made, each with the expectation of growing old together. Are these sweet words intended to be tools for temporary love and seduction?</p>
<p>Or will there be a real intention to fulfill them? If one is determined to fulfill them and can actually practice their promises, then this is enough to be a manifestation of a sense of responsibility. Today, people often separate halfway and have other loves, mostly because they have met more handsome men and women, or because they are interested in their wealth and status. They disregard all vows and even abandon their children. This kind of behavior of losing a sense of responsibility is most common today. With such people, is it not difficult to devote themselves to the country and forget themselves in public matters? Recently, some people have advocated overthrowing chastity, glorifying it as the liberation of women. I think that overthrowing chastity is most unfavorable to women. Why? Although there are many theories of free love, in practice, men mostly take sexual desire and beauty as prerequisites, and women are easily blinded by emotions. There are very few who choose with reason. What women rely on is only beauty in a short period of ten years. After this period, they are easily disgusted by men. The old society was like this, and the new society is also like this. Moreover, because of pregnancy, women are prone to illness. When they are abandoned, their beauty has declined and it is difficult to marry again. Men are not like this. They age later, have stronger carnal desires, have no burden of pregnancy, and have stronger motivation to make a living, so they are often in a superior position. I have seen many women in society who are subjected to this oppression. In the past, the saying of chastity was indeed one-sided on the surface, but in fact, women received considerable protection. Even if men took concubines and openly abandoned their wives, there were not many in society. Women mostly guarded their chastity, and there were also many men who were loyal to their wives, driven by conscience. Since ancient times, enlightened people have never advocated encouraging young widows to remain chaste, and in the past, there was no legal compulsion to reward chastity. Only the spirit of perseverance was praised. Although the reward was only for women, the impact actually extended to the entire society. Now that this spirit has long disappeared, what is there left to overthrow? Moreover, the nature of our people has recently become increasingly frivolous and superficial, unable to foresee the future, and easily forgetful. The five-minute patriotic enthusiasm is laughed at by the world. Officials make solemn vows, but few can keep them. The weakness of the will and strength of the majority of people is undeniable. Today, if we want to save the situation, empty words will not be effective. We must start with improving eugenics and heredity, and cultivate a general group of young men and women with a serious and solemn style. There must be strong and steadfast parents, especially mothers, and then can healthy children be born. After repeated generations, there will be a majority of great-character people to clean up this broken and rotten situation. Educators and those responsible for guiding society, please do not forget this.</p>
<p>What ordinary people call loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness has long been regarded as pedantic and not worth mentioning. However, after careful analysis, it is so important to the cultivation of a sense of responsibility that the ancient people's promotion and role models were not pedantic. A few days ago, my child heard Mr. Huang Renzhi talk about recent events in Japan, saying that the Japanese people's spirit of responsibility is truly unmatched. How did they achieve this? It is because of the power of promotion and advancement. General Nogi won the war against the strong Russia, and the whole country respected him as a military god. When Emperor Meiji died, he killed himself to die for his ruler, and his wife also committed suicide at the high age of seventy to die for her husband. From the perspective of today's people, it seems meaningless, but its impact on the military and national training and social discipline is very large. Now there is Nogi Shrine in Tokyo. Those who pass by the door bow and pay their respects, making people associate sacrificing oneself for the country and sacrificing oneself for one's husband with winning the war against the strong Russia, and their sense of responsibility and willingness to sacrifice for the country will naturally arise. They can promote the old morality so that the spirit of patriotism is like that. Our people overthrow all rituals and teachings, and the current state of corruption is like this, which can not be deeply thought about? If the above can be implemented, not only can national products be promoted, but all national affairs can also be improved. I am willing to encourage and learn from you all to contribute to the one-in-ten-thousand.</p>
<h3>What Constitutes a Perfectly Happy Family</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Huh! This publication is the "National Products Weekly," not a publication that studies women and families. Why would I raise such a question in this publication – what constitutes a perfectly happy family? I think: when you see this title, before reading the main text, you may have such doubts and such curiosity, right? In fact, to put it bluntly, there is no need to doubt, and there is nothing curious about it.</p>
<p>Because, among all living beings in the world, unless they are "monks" who embrace celibacy, who doesn't need a family? Especially a happy family, which is envied by everyone. Then, "what constitutes a perfectly happy family?" This question is very broad, and naturally, everyone urgently wants to know the answer. Moreover, in this "Women's National Products Year," it is even more something that everyone should understand. The question I am talking about now involves national products, so I will talk about it in this publication.</p>
<p>We know that the psychology of the general public regarding "happy families" can be summarized in one word: "happiness." However, I feel that in this day and age, a family that is simply "happy" cannot be said to be a "perfectly happy family," but can only be said to be a "nine-tenths happy family." There is still "one-tenth of happiness" that you should understand, which is to adopt "national products" for everything, whether it is clothing, food, or daily necessities. If you can't find even a little bit of "foreign goods" in your home, then your family is a "perfectly happy family"! Otherwise, it is "a fly in the ointment"! How can you talk about "perfect happiness"?</p>

<h3>Random Talk on Ritual and Doctrine</h3>
<p>— Feng Zi</p>
<p>After Emperor Gaozu of Han ascended to the throne, because the ministers were unrestrained, he felt that the taste of sitting on the dragon court was not necessarily better than living in a cool pavilion. It was not until Sun Tong had established the court etiquette that he suddenly realized the nobility of being the Yellow Emperor and felt the need for ritual and doctrine.</p>
<p>In fact, those who need ritual and doctrine are only emperors. Those who advocate ritual and doctrine often only think for emperors and kings. They often put shackles on the masses, separating people with high walls, and only giving a few careerists special privileges. If someone gets rid of the shackles, climbs over the high walls, and even shakes the special privileges of the careerists, that is betraying ritual and doctrine, becoming a "rebellious minister and traitor," and "everyone can punish him."</p>
<p>However, this is not an immutable law.</p>
<p>If the "rebellious minister and traitor" can become an emperor, the gentlemen who advocate ritual and doctrine will immediately come with the signboard of ritual and doctrine. This time, naturally, they are still thinking for the emperor and king. Once the rebellious minister and traitor sits on the dragon court, he will inevitably have ambitions. Since the shackles cannot lock himself, and there are still many benefits, he might as well do a favor. Therefore, for thousands of years, the various schools of thought were dismissed as heresies and almost completely lost, but Confucius was able to stand tall alone.</p>
<p>Confucius's towering presence is also the reason why ritual and doctrine do not fall behind. Moreover, scholars also want to use it as their housekeeping skills and promote it vigorously. Thus, men subjugate women, which is ritual; masters oppress servants, which is ritual; superiors drive subordinates, which is ritual; and as for emperors governing the country, it is of course indispensable to ritual and doctrine. This understanding becomes deeper and deeper, and it reaches the point where even if one is not a "rebellious minister and traitor," but "if the ruler wants the minister to die," then the minister "must die."</p>
<p>This is where "perhaps" arises.</p>
<p>But the more tragic result is the scene of defending Suiyang City to the death. According to the Tang History, Biography of Loyalty and Righteousness: "Zhang Xun defended Suiyang City, and the siege by the rebels lasted for a long time. The food in the city was exhausted, and children were exchanged for food, and bones were broken for firewood. Xun then took out his concubine, killed her in front of the three armies, and feasted the soldiers, saying, 'Please, gentlemen, work hard for the country to defend the city, with one heart and no second. Xun cannot cut his own flesh to feed the soldiers, so how can he regret this woman!' The soldiers all shed tears and could not bear to eat her. Xun forcibly ordered them to eat her. After the women in the city were exhausted, they were followed by men, old and young, and the population eaten was twenty to thirty thousand."</p>
<p>This time, it reached the point where the husband had to kill his wife, and the official had to kill the people, and they all had to die. Because to preserve one's loyalty to the master and complete the ritual and doctrine, one does not hesitate to sacrifice the innocent. What is so-called ritual and doctrine, in this case, reveals its true face: it turns out to be a man-eating demon!</p>
<h3>In Defense of "Critics"</h3>
<p>— Ye Rong</p>
<p>"Critics" seem to have become the target of public criticism recently. If they point out shortcomings, they are guilty of "devastation," and it is said that they "killed the wrong person." However, if they praise a work, they are guilty of "nervousness," making the literary world "filled with joy," which does not help the development of culture. The former has already been regarded as a "thug," and it is said that the "suffocated writers" will be kicked into the "cold palace" and suffer some confinement. The latter also has many people who are verbally criticizing and writing against them.</p>
<p>This reaction comes partly from the "group of writers," who say that their creation is suffocated by "criticism." On the other hand, it does not seem to be writers, but some chivalrous people who are speaking out for the writers. Judging from their tone of compassion for the future of culture and the writers, it can be seen that they are third parties standing by.</p>
<p>Critics, caught in the crossfire, seem to be speechless, knowing that their sins are heavy and have no excuse to answer. However, the person who jumped onto the stage and chopped the actor playing Cao Cao to death with an axe is actually not a critic today, but the real Cao Cao who is being played. Although the woodcutter is also in the audience today, he is not so confused that he cannot tell black from white, or distinguish between truth and falsehood. Moreover, the position of a critic is not the same as the position of a woodcutter in the audience, and besides, it is the real Cao Cao who wants to chop him with an axe?</p>
<p>If he "killed the wrong person," it was only out of "misunderstanding," not because he had a feud with the actor, which is excusable.</p>
<p>What a true critic wants to point out is whether Cao Cao's social existence is real, and how well the actor plays and sings Cao Cao. If Cao Cao is played as Yue Fei, or Yue Fei is played as Cao Cao, then chopping him with an axe is justified. The direction of the critic's axe is in this direction, not on the stage, and even less on the actor on the stage.</p>
<p>Critics are not afraid of Cao Cao being played vividly, but hate that the actors cannot vividly present Cao Cao to the audience. They hate that the ones playing Cao Cao are the Cao Caos themselves, and the ones who want to chop the actors to death are also Cao Cao. Because he plays too much like themselves. The actors should not "mistake the enemy." Although I am not a critic, I am speaking out for the true critics. Critics will not "kill the wrong person." If there is a "misunderstanding," it is the responsibility of the individual who executes the "axe punishment." Therefore, the "woodcutter" is always a woodcutter, not a critic.</p>
<h3>Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fenjia</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have been suffering from insomnia almost every night.</p>
<p>Insomnia is not a serious symptom, but it is a threat to people who lead a life of mental labor. I don't know how this insomnia started. As usual, I go to bed at ten o'clock every night. The bed has a light switch, and as long as I reach out and turn off the light, I can fall into a dream. In dreams, all human beings are equal, whether they are rich people with millions of dollars or small people with no way out.</p>
<p>However, one night, the situation was different. I turned off the light as usual, gave a last glance at the darkness surrounding me, and closed my eyelids, ready to go to the land of sweet dreams to find my good dreams. Unexpectedly, although my eyelids were closed, dreams kept me out of the door, as if everything was destined for me to suffer a night of torment. I tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep. My mind was like a special express train, and my thoughts were surging endlessly without stopping.</p>
<p>The first thing that entered my mind was the issue of the "Beijing School" and "Shanghai School" in the literary world. Then, the eight characters "Celebrities, talent, commercial competition, auction" quickly flashed through my mind. Next, from the "Beijing School" and "Shanghai School" in the literary world, I thought of the "Beijing School" and "Shanghai School" in the theater world, and thought of Mei Lanfang's "Drunken Concubine" and Xiao Dazi's "The Civet Cat for the Prince." I thought that the drama performed by the rough and strange Xiao Dazi was certainly not as good as the drama performed by Dr. of Literature Mei Lanfang, and that the "Shanghai School" was certainly not as good as the "Beijing School." Finally, I felt that the word "Beijing School" was a bit inappropriate and should be changed to "Beiping School" Because Beijing has now been renamed Beiping, and Beijing opera has also been renamed Ping opera. If people in the literary world still call themselves the "Beijing School," they will inevitably be seen as having some suspicion. Thinking this way, thoughts emerged one after another, and the dreamland moved further and further away from me.</p>
<p>Suddenly opening my eyes, what appeared before me was a mass of darkness. This darkness made me distressed, and I couldn't help but think that there were many things to do tomorrow, and I must fall asleep tonight, otherwise, even if I could barely do things tomorrow, I would be extraordinarily tired, and all the planned plans would be finished. Therefore, I tried to force those thoughts and force myself into the dreamland.</p>
<p>"Sleep! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight..." I silently recited the numbers. This was taught to me by a friend, who said that it had unexpected power. People with insomnia only need to keep reciting, and before they reach a hundred, they will unknowingly fall into a dream. Now, I tried it out. But when I was still awake after counting nearly a thousand, I knew that this method was not working and I had to find another way. Another way was to put my hand under my left breast and try to think about my feet, so that the blood in my head would flow down and it would be easier to fall asleep. This was what I read in a book. It was not difficult to put it into practice. It was just that thinking about my feet was too boring. It would be better to think about my buttocks, which would probably also allow the blood in my head to flow down. So, I tried my best to concentrate my thoughts on my buttocks. Who knew that this would be even worse! My thoughts quickly turned from my buttocks to Mr. Lin Yutang's article "On Kicking Butts," and from that article to the joke mentioned in the Ku Cha An Jokes Collection that ridiculed comparing heads to buttocks, and sleep was even more difficult to come to me.</p>
<p>The sky brightened while I was trying to sleep. The sky was bright, and I had to get up and do things. As soon as I did things, I was terribly tired and yawning constantly, and I just wanted to lie down on the bed and sleep. With great difficulty, I managed to get to bed, and as soon as my head hit the pillow, I couldn't fall asleep again. Everything was just a continuation of last night. Thoughts were still surging, my mind was still running on a special express train, and there was even more of a sound:</p>
<p>"Run faster! America, run faster!"</p>
<p>This was the name of a short story, and the author was forgotten, probably the American Gold. I don't know why, but at this time, it kept echoing in my mind continuously. In order to make this sound disappear, I had to replace it with another kind of thought. So, I thought of Puyi becoming emperor, the feeling of sitting on the throne, Qin Shihuang, Alexander, Napoleon, Wilhelm II, Hitler, and World War II. At this time, my mind made a "boom" sound, as if the gunpowder depot of the Second World War had exploded.</p>
<p>In this way, I watched another night of darkness with my eyes wide open. Several nights in a row passed in insomnia. Fatigue, disappointment, and distress attacked my weak body, and I really couldn't hold on any longer. I repeatedly wanted to go to the pharmacy to buy a bottle of sedative water to drink, but I was always stopped by my wife. My wife's cowardly heart was always afraid that if I drank sedative water, I would fall into a long sleep and never wake up. But she didn't know that I was eager to be able to sleep forever. Because once I slept forever, I wouldn't have to face the darkness every night, I wouldn't have to fear the arrival of World War II, and I wouldn't have to fear bowing to Puyi, who was about my age one day.</p>
<h3>Review of "Jealousy"</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Recently, the Commercial Press published a play titled "Jealousy," translated by Mr. Li Liewen during his time in France.</p>
<p>Regarding the French playwright J.J. Bernard, I have no prior knowledge. However, based solely on his play "Jealousy," we can discern that he is an exceptionally talented playwright.</p>
<p>"Jealousy" was originally titled "Le Feu qui reprend mal" (The Fire That Rekindles Poorly). The translator, deeming the original title cumbersome, renamed it "Jealousy." However, I believe the original title better expresses the play's meaning, as we cannot merely regard this book as "a new page in the study of jealousy" (in the words of the critic Regis Gignour). Whether intentional or not, the author presents more profound issues within this play, issues related to the previous World War.</p>
<p>The plot is remarkably simple, with only four characters: a married couple, the wife's elderly father, and a female friend. The setting is a small city in France, taking place after the European war. The husband, Andre, is a high school teacher who was captured at the beginning of the war and imprisoned in the Darmstadt camp for four years. During this time, his wife, Blanche, endured four years of anticipation and suffering. However, in the last few months, like many households in that small city, she housed an American soldier. Later, she explained this to her friend, Jeanne: "The Mayor insisted so earnestly. You can believe that I would never have wanted to otherwise. But the Mayor told me that in a small town like ours, a teacher's wife should set a good example. Andre would have told me the same thing if he were here. That is why I accepted." However, on the very day the armistice was signed, when the father, wife, and friends enthusiastically welcomed Andre home, he became suspicious and jealous of his wife. Subsequently, almost without any concrete evidence, the play portrays the development of the husband's doubts and jealousy. The happiness of the reunited couple, which he had dreamed of for four years, never materializes, and they argue every day. This harsh reality brings Blanche a disappointment that surpasses all the pain she had endured for four years:</p>
<p>Blanche (pensively)... Andre was captured. At that time, I had a duty. He was not by my side; he was unfortunate, so he could compete. But now he has returned, and he is not the same Andre.</p>
<p>Jeanne, you take your own disappointment too seriously; you are not as forgiving as you used to be.</p>
<p>Blanche Perhaps so; but everyday life is so ruthless! It shows us all the worst aspects of the people we love... Since he returned, Andre is just an ordinary man in my eyes.</p>
<p>It is this ruthless everyday life that forces her to leave her husband and follow the American soldier, who lived in the same house as her for several months, to a new world. Although nothing ever happened between them, he expressed his love for her when he left, and they still correspond. Although she does not actually leave, and although at the end of the play, she says to her suspicious and jealous husband, "Oh, how can you ask me to leave?" her heart is broken. She is experiencing profound disillusionment, and her future life is destined to be unhappy. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Father and Daughter (6)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>She seemed to fully understand the suffering in her father's heart, knowing that this was a natural path for him to take given his circumstances. Her resentment towards her father had subsided, and condemnation had turned into comfort.</p>
<p>"From now on, child, I promise you from the bottom of my heart—I will never bring a drop of alcohol near my lips again!" He made the greatest resolution, his eyes wide as he spoke.</p>
<p>"I know you will do it, for your daughter, for yourself."</p>
<p>After she said that, she lifted her face and leaned close to his.</p>
<p>It was already broad daylight, and the beautiful autumn morning light streamed in through the gaps in the curtains, shining on them. She helped her father up, slowly stood up, walked to the window, pulled back the curtains, and looked at the scenery outside. Before her were piles of blood-red maple leaves, so vibrant, that it was hard to believe that in a few days they would fall to the ground and be trampled into dust. The road was already covered with yellow fallen leaves, which had also had good days as green as jade; but autumn had ended everything, and they could only lie peacefully on the ground.</p>
<p>He stared intently, as if deep in thought, and then nodded slightly, muttering:</p>
<p>"I must cherish myself, I must cherish myself!"</p>
<p>The daughter, standing by his side, smiled at him when she heard these words, the sunlight shining on their faces with an unusual radiance. After that, they lived even more peacefully, passing through autumn and into the bleak winter days. But their hearts were warm, father and daughter giving each other comfort.</p>
<p>One evening, the father went to the bachelor's club, because there was a lecture by a well-known person there. She was sitting alone in the sitting room, knitting a wool coat for her father. A snow-white Persian cat, sent by a friend, was playing with the ball of yarn. She watched it with interest, but her hands did not stop working. At this moment, the maid came in and said to her:</p>
<p>"Miss, there is a female guest outside to see the master."</p>
<p>"What, a female guest?"</p>
<p>She put down her work, asking with a hint of surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes, she looks like she's in her thirties, she came alone in a car."</p>
<p>"Didn't you tell her that the master is not at home?"</p>
<p>"She said she would like to see the young lady as well."</p>
<p>"She knows me?"</p>
<p>"It seems she does."</p>
<p>"Then please, show her in."</p>
<p>She stood up, brushed the loose wool from her clothes, and ran her fingers through her hair; a great doubt arose in her heart. For so many years, there had never been a single female guest visiting her father, what kind of woman could this be? The female guest had already walked in with the maid, and suddenly it was as if a weak current ran through her body. She doubted her eyes, widened them a little more, and her heart began to tremble. She wanted to call out something, but she immediately knew that it was too inappropriate, so she forced herself to hold back. She saw that the woman was also staring at her, blankly, as if she had forgotten herself. She saw that the woman was nearly fifty years old, but had a good figure, fashionable clothes, and with her special makeup, looked easily ten or fifteen years younger. At the corner of her eye, she clearly saw that red mole. The female guest also seemed to want to suddenly shout something, but she swallowed it back, and only stammered:</p>

<h3>Gold Market Repeatedly Breaks Through 700 Yuan Mark in Half-Day Trading</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Slightly Up by 40 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was extremely stable. It repeatedly broke through the 700 yuan mark during the day, with market conditions appearing slightly erratic. Overseas telecommunications also lacked any special stimulus, and market sentiment was still good. At the opening of the morning session, overseas silver markets in the UK and US were declining, exchange rates were relatively stable, the Five Metals Exchange saw a decrease in the price of forward silver by 2.0-3.5%, London spot gold decreased by 2 pence, US cotton increased by 2 pounds, and US wheat was down by 0.075. Stock prices fluctuated slightly. Reuters from Washington reported that the US Treasury Department announced the issuance of 1,000,000,000 yuan in public debt. Reports also indicated that the US Treasury Department claimed that silver coins would be minted once a substantial amount of silver was collected. The opening price for rough bars immediately fell to 95 yuan. However, Reuters reported that the US Senate Banking Committee had made four amendments to the currency system proposal, including a limit of 2 years on the use of a 2,000,000,000 yuan stabilization fund, to be managed by a five-person committee, and a restriction on the President's power to reduce the value of the US dollar within two years. However, it was also reported that the time frame for these provisions might be shortened. Market sentiment then stabilized. After the opening, the domestic market suddenly tightened, breaking through the 700 yuan mark. Afterwards, due to banks selling at high prices and buying at low prices to cover their positions, the market struggled around 700 yuan. Finally, as the exchange rate stabilized and the gold market weakened slightly, Reuters re-dispatched the above two telegrams, which had little impact. The price of refined gold was 1,096 yuan. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 695.7 yuan, a decrease of 2.3 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 5.5 yuan. Exchange rates at the opening were 1 shilling 4.25 pence for the near-term sale of British currency, and 33.875 yuan for US currency. Hengxing immediately sold when it entered the market for 5.5 yuan, but due to Shunli, Yuanmao, Yongjin, and other firms needing to settle US dollars for May at 34.5 yuan, the market was stable. Afterwards, the domestic market gradually tightened. Yuanmao, Yongda, Dafa, Yongda, Decheng, Zhifeng, Yongying, Fengheng, Yuanchang, Yongyi, and other firms rushed to purchase futures contracts, pushing the price up to 702.5 yuan in an instant. HSBC, Huabi, and Datong sold US dollars for April at 1.25, while Hengyu, Bingxing, Shunli, Yuanchang, Yongyi, Dayong, and other firms sold high to take profits. It was learned that HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the market re-entered the 700 yuan range. However, due to Zhifeng, Yongfu, Yuheng, Yu Zhengchang still having buying interest, the price rose again to 701.3 yuan. Bingxing and Hengyu sold again, Citibank also sold March US dollars at 34 yuan, and the situation weakened again. Dadecheng and other firms also sold, and the price fell to 697.5 yuan. Shanghai then sold March US dollars at 0.0625 and May at 0.4375. Soon after, Mitsui purchased May US dollars at 0.4375, and Zhifeng, Yonghui, Xiangtong, Hengyu, and other firms jointly purchased futures contracts, causing the market to rebound to above 700 yuan. April US dollars at 0.1875 were difficult to settle. Zhifeng, Yongyi, Fengyong, Yuanchang, and other firms re-entered, causing the market to rise to 701.8 yuan. Mitsui and Citibank sold April US dollars at 0.125, and Dafa, Yongyuan, Mao Yongheng, Xingzhao, and Fengchang successively supplied futures contracts, causing the market to gradually retreat to 697.7 yuan. Zhifeng, Yonghui, and Xiang re-entered, and the market closed at 698.4 yuan at noon. Goods were traded at 8.7 yuan. After the close, the market was initially stable but then weakened. Hengtai and Zhifeng sold Yong off their positions, and the price finally retreated to within 8 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 702.5 yuan, and the lowest was 695.5 yuan, a difference of 7 yuan. As a result, the market rose slightly by 40 cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price, due to HSBC Bank's US dollar listed price remaining unchanged at 33.5 yuan, resulted in a standard gold price of over 716 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 18 yuan below the standard price, a very small difference compared to the previous close. The registered price for this month was 721 yuan, February was 712 yuan, and March was 698 yuan. The morning replenishment price was 721 yuan. The price of refined gold was 1,096 yuan. Trading in the market was scarce, with slight buying by customers. Yingfengheng sold to the Tianjin group for 1,096.5 yuan, which was then reduced to 1,093.5 yuan. Only about 500 taels were traded in total. 1,561 futures contracts remained for January, and 6,489 for February.</p>
<p>Trading in the market remained flat. Overall, Bingxing, Yuanmao, Yifeng, Yongchang, Shengyong, Daxing, Yongheng, Yuheng, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, Yuanheng, and goods were on the selling side, while Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Mao Yongyong, Decheng, Shunli, Hengchang, Yongxianghe, Sida, Huixiang, Dachang, Xiangda, Kangfutai, and Heng were on the buying side. Yuanchang, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yuanmao, Yongdafa, Yongyuan, Chuntengtai were initially buyers and later sellers, while Hengxing, Hengxingyuan, Dadecheng were initially sellers and later buyers. The Dalian group, along with Shunli, jointly traded approximately 2,100 contracts, rolling in over 300 contracts. Wanxing jointly traded slightly over 1,100 contracts, rolling in a few contracts. The Guangzhou group, along with Hengxing, were initially sellers and later buyers, with slightly more selling. The total number of transactions today was 46,333 contracts. The total number of March chips was approximately 35,980, with 34 long positions and 64 short positions in total.</p>

<h3>Clearing of Silver and Cash Transactions Approaching End</h3>
<p>| Complexity and Simplicity Seen |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interest rate for interbank loans in both Chinese and foreign banks remained unchanged in the morning and afternoon markets, calculated at 5%. Head drafts were level with no added water, and there was an excess of head cash, with no one willing to accept it. There was even a discount of 20 cents per thousand yuan for accepting cash, which was a recent record low due to the falling market. As head drafts were loose and acceptance was difficult, there was a reluctance to accept cash, hence the need for a discount on cash. The turnover of short-term bills was 4,890,000 yuan in the morning market for transfers and new transactions, and 300,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Transactions in the small clearing house amounted to over 500,000 yuan. Foreign pawn transactions involved redemptions of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan and new loans of over 700,000 yuan.

<h3>Significant Fluctuations in Jiangjiao</h3>
<p>Morning Market Surges 35 Yuan</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Retreats 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollar market experienced a special surge in the morning, reaching 880 yuan, a rise of as much as 35 yuan compared to the previous day's morning market. However, the market then fell sharply by 20 yuan in the afternoon, to 860 yuan. The magnitude of the fluctuations was rarely seen. Nevertheless, the final result was an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The difference in fluctuations was astonishing. The transaction volume in the morning market was 22,000 jiao, and 12,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were priced at 792.2 yuan in the morning market and 792.8 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in an increase of 40 cents compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The transaction volume was 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins retracted by 500 wen, to 291,500 wen, with 34,980 strings traded, totaling a value of 12,000 foreign dollars.</p>
<h3>Short Squeeze in Securities and Bond Markets Intensifies</h3>
<p>| Continues to Rise Several Jiao to 1.1 Yuan |</p>
<p>| Salt Tax Actually Exceeds 50 Yuan Mark |</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, with the final one or two days of futures trading for this month approaching, the market continued to experience a short squeeze. The salt tax actually broke through the 50 yuan mark, as the reporter had predicted. From there, it steadily rose, closing near 51 yuan. Far-term salt tax also reached 50 yuan. Currently, the market is temporarily disengaging and focusing on chips. The short covering in the market is mostly driven by retail investors, while firms #4 and #11 consistently sold, and firm #46 joined the selling side in the afternoon, with a significant volume. The trend seems to be driven by a short squeeze leading to long position swapping, which inevitably leads to times of short selling. Today's trend is expected to be volatile, as the last day of trading for January futures is approaching. Trading ended yesterday, with good gains in each of the four trading sessions throughout the day, generally rising by 20-30 cents. In the middle, there was a slight pullback in one or two stocks due to aggressive selling by large firms, but this did not significantly affect the overall market. If firm #46 continues to sell, the market may still experience fluctuations, as it is rumored that the firm still has a large selling appetite, while retail shorts have mostly covered their positions. As a result, market prices continued to rise, ranging from several jiao to 1.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated at 22 to 23 million yuan. Due to the lateness of the hour, detailed figures were omitted.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Firm and Rising</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 23rd that the New York stock market was exceptionally firm and rising due to positive news regarding industrial and commercial legislation, including the passage of the Vincent Act. Steel and shipbuilding stocks were particularly strong, and the overall market rose several jiao to 4 yuan. Bonds experienced slight variations, and sugar stocks rose due to the recognition of Cuba. The trend is expected to remain high. The total transaction volume for the day was 2,380,000 shares. The wheat market exhibited oversold conditions, and Kansas was suffering from dust storms and drought, making it extremely favorable for buyers. The shelving of legislation to reduce cotton acreage, the opposition of a minority of senators to the gold bill, and the reduction of government spending in the mid-February consumption process all made it unfavorable to buy at the moment. The spot market was firm. The Dow Jones Indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 106.62 Up 1.53</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 48.11 Up 0.57</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 29.96 Up 0.11</p>
<p>40 Bonds 88.60 Down 0.22</p>
<p>11 Commodities 52.15 Down 0.18</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Marked Yarn Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly and the situation appeared relatively stable, but actual demand was weak. It was found that only slightly less than 300 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day. This softened market sentiment. It is expected that the end of the lunar year will cause various parties to prepare to close their accounts, so spot sales feel especially bleak.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Muted: At the opening of the marked cotton market, there was a slight tightening of market sentiment due to a lack of sellers. Prices rose by 3-560 cents in various months. In the afternoon, it was heard that there were not many spot transactions and prices fell by 1.1-3 cents in various months. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,200 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 3,500 bales, Xiesheng 400 bales, and Yuanda 700 bales. Shenji bought 600 bales, Yukang 650 bales, Chuangji 250 bales, and Wenhe 300 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>March 174.8 Up 55 5,750</p>
<p>January 170.5 Down 2 12,450</p>
<p>April 176.4 44 1,050</p>
<p>February 172.5 62 4,550</p>
<p>Total 115,800</p>
<p>Fewer Yarn Sales: The current sales situation is increasingly clear. It was found that the total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the day was only 283. The market was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 147 Guangdong 80 Fellow Traders 10</p>
<p>Changsha 20 Ningbo 1 Zhenjiang 25</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Shows Signs of a Short Squeeze</h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm again, with the delivery period for this month approaching, and sellers lacking sufficient chips to clear their positions. Short sentiment is increasingly strong, showing signs of a short squeeze. Distant months have also been stimulated, but spot cotton transactions are particularly scarce. According to some, there are hundreds of thousands of dans of cotton stored in Hankou, but due to excessive moisture, it is difficult to export to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Slightly Smart: At the opening of the Zheng standard market, scattering short covering for this month caused prices to rise across the board by 2.1-3 cents. In the afternoon, large long players closed their positions, causing prices to fall by 0.05-0.15 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 71,400 dans. It was found that Yuanda sold 8,200 dans, Shenchang 2,300 dans, Tongfu 1,000 dans, Tongji 1,500 dans, Yongchang 1,200 dans, Xinheng 2,200 dans, Chuangji 2,000 dans, Tonghe 1,700 dans, Changhe 1,700 dans, and Jifeng 1,700 dans. Dafeng bought 4,300 dans, Changfeng 6,800 dans, Gengfeng 1,600 dans, Renfeng 1,700 dans, Hengyi 2,100 dans, Xiesheng 2,100 dans, and Yuchang 1,600 dans. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>April 4195 Up 20 192,200</p>
<p>January 4220 Up 25 64,900</p>

<p>March 4190 15 198,800</p>
<p>Total 756,800</p>
<p>Factory Demand Remains Stagnant: The spot cotton business remains sluggish. Sources include 1,119 bales of Yao cotton and 1,200 bales of Tong cotton. Current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Huoji 3775 Yeqin Factory enters 300 bales Spot delivery to Wuxi</p>
<p>Shashi 4025 Shenxin Factory enters 500 pieces February delivery to factory</p>
<p>Lingbao 4875 Also 84 pieces Also</p>
<h3>Slight Rise in US Cotton Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially fell due to mass selling, but later rose due to spot merchants buying and strength from Wall Street. As a result, the spot price remained unchanged, while futures rose by two to four points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures fell by ten to eleven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by thirteen points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to long positions closing, but later rebounded as brokers bought on behalf of Japanese merchants. As a result, Pingar rose by 2.5 angles, Ormla fell by 1.5 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek fell by 7.5 angles. (Original telegraph from the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Food Factories Massively Sell Futures Flour, Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for each month generally showed a tired and falling trend. Although the quotation for foreign wheat improved by 0.20 outside of Chicago, and even more in Canada, people inside and outside the industry were not encouraged by this. It was rumored in the market that the government was borrowing wheat and there were two more ships for sale, with the price being 4.20 yuan, delivered in Shanghai, to be purchased proportionally by large and small factories. Therefore, market sentiment was already weak, and factory selling was also strong, with the market showing declines across the board. When the market opened in the afternoon, factories continued to sell distant months, but because buying interest was weak, the volume of selling was not high. As for the current month, because of mutual competition between longs and shorts, the changes were negligible. As a result, the current month was slightly down by 0.005 yuan compared to the previous day, February fell by 0.0225 yuan, March and April fell by 0.0175 yuan, May fell by 0.015 yuan, and June fell by 0.0125 yuan.</p>
<h3>Distant New Wheat Breaks Eight-Angle Threshold</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market generally showed a flat and tired trend. Although the quotation for foreign wheat improved by 0.10 and 0.20 yuan, the current month, due to the approaching settlement, longs were eager to sell back. Factories were importing foreign wheat, and it seemed they had no intention to accept delivery. Therefore, it finally fell to as low as 3.95 yuan, down another 0.03 yuan from the previous day. Distant trading remained not very active, with limited fluctuations. However, June had already broken the 0.80-angle threshold, falling to 0.79 angles. It is said that if the government were to sell wheat together, there would be little hope for standard wheat.</p>
<h3>客秈 (Ke Xian) Only Has 福州 (Fuzhou) as a Route</h3>
<p>||Prices Continue to Rise by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan||</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice from Minhua was very active. Since the end of the war, the Fuzhou gang has had a very strong demand from various places. In recent days, Chinese merchant ships have been opening up daily, so the Fuzhou gang is quite enthusiastic. In addition to the Fuzhou provincial gang, the Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Xinghua gangs also have businesses. However, because everything has not yet been properly coordinated, only a small number of Hakka people are contacting merchants to arrange for loading. The market has not yet opened up, and the spot goods have not yet been loaded. The appetite of the provincial gang continues to increase. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags were traded, and the price has risen by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. Brokers are still optimistic and are quoting prices 0.10 yuan higher, so the gang has not been able to conduct business smoothly. Our street and the Zhejiang gang also have an appetite, but because the price is rising, they dare not do too much. Yesterday, our street traded more than 1,000 bags, and the Zhejiang gang did not move. According to the current activity of this Ke Xian rice, the market still needs to be optimistic. However, the inventory in the market is very sufficient, and deliveries arrive daily, so prices have not yet jumped.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Tong Geng Price Good, Up 0.05 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources for all gangs were scarce, with only ship numbers 25 and 26 arriving (totaling over 3,000 shi). The wholesale and retail appetite from our street was relatively lackluster, so the price of Chang gang, Suzhou Tong gang's thick Geng rice increased by 0.05 yuan. However, South Port's early rice did not show any change. As for late rice, the customer's interest in bagged rice has turned lazy, so the whole city only took 500-600 bags of Si Song high-quality goods from the Beiyang gang. Therefore, most late rice such as Qing Jiao and Xi Lian were only moving in small quantities. Fortunately, the market did not have much arriving goods and still appears steady. Du Yang's top-quality goods lacked flavor, and the market showed a brisk color. Yin Yuan seems to be slightly stable, while Bian Yuan is still outstanding.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, 50 or more ships arrived from various routes along the river. The inland river freezing has cleared, and the sales appetite for various colors in the market has slightly moved. The market for white Geng, Yang Du, Bu Ke, and top-quality goods is stable. White Yuan has tightened by several points. Early thin rice Yin Yuan is firm. The bagged goods are carefully being moved.</p>
<h3>Green Beans are Plentiful, Market is Tired</h3>
<p>The market condition for green beans has been flat for a long time. There are not many sources. The bottom inventory is about 50,000 to 60,000 bags of both Ming and Mao green beans. However, Ming green beans are more numerous than Mao green beans. The main outlet is Nanhua, and the Beiyang has the Yantai gang. Western merchants are not as continuous in their trading as in previous years, so it is not easy for the market to improve. However, the selling price of high-quality vegetable green beans is 5.12 yuan, which is probably the bottom. Yesterday, the market had a Western firm, Gao Zeng Foreign Firm, purchasing 799 bags of high-quality vegetable green beans, with the price being 5.18 yuan, which is said to be an unprocessed price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Gradually Turns Upwards</h3>
<p>||Chao Qing Returns Soft||</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to the rise in Customs Gold and the shrinking of the Dutch exchange rate, making the trend even tighter. The association’s marked price for No. 24 coarse granulated white common goods was 19.60 yuan, up 0.20 yuan from the previous day. Transit goods were quoted up by 0.15 yuan, at 6.70 yuan. Old Dutch red goods were 16 yuan, and new goods were 15.75 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted up to 20 yuan, but the deal did not go through. The factory's refined white sugar was in short supply, and Zhenyu No. 1 also rose by 0.20 yuan to 18.80 yuan. Changxing opened more than 1,000 bags of Zheng refined Dutch white sugar, with the price being 19 yuan. Chao Qing did not continue to open because the opinions of the firms on both sides did not come close, and the market trend looked small.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Bitter Apricot Kernels Scarce and Surprisingly Popular</h3>
<p>Bitter apricot kernels are now in short supply because there is no continuing supply, and the inventory is thin. At the same time, there is demand from the sales side, making the trend tight and popular. Yesterday, the higher-priced goods in the market were being asked for over 30 yuan by customers, up about 10 yuan from the lowest price.</p>
<h3>A List of Chinese-Owned Woolen Mills in Tianjin and Beijing</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: In addition to the official military and political department's Beijing Woolen Mill, there are seven woolen mills in the Tianjin and Beijing area that are operated by Chinese merchants. The factory names and addresses are listed below for reference:</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Daily Necessities Market (4) Xi Nan</h3>
<p>Originally, in our country, the shopkeepers provided food and lodging for their employees, and the salaries they received were only for supporting their families. Since the "foreign firm system" became popular, this food and lodging issue has changed. It is included in the salary and is no longer provided. Later, our country's banks and companies also did the same. Therefore, friends who work in companies and firms have a problem with eating. Besides going home to eat, they have to go to restaurants, but both are expensive. Frugal friends then sometimes eat dry food, and sometimes order food temporarily. Especially in the area from East Sichuan Road to the Bund, where foreign firms, banks, large companies, and customs are located, the resolution of the eating problem for general staff is very serious. However, in this world, if there is a need, there will be a supply. Temporary canteens established for consumption are also like bamboo shoots after a rain. The most famous is the road next to the Bank of Communications, where there are actually signs saying "Food Available on the Left," with braised beef, coffee, bread, toast, etc., available. On Sundays, it also rests like other firms. North of the Waibaidu Bridge, in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, there are many docks, so there are only things like fried dough sticks and large pancakes, just to fill the stomachs of coolies.</p>
<p>Along the river, regarding food, there is also the fish market in the French Concession's 16 Pu. Their transactions are fair. When most people are still soundly asleep, before dawn, the peddlers who rush to the small vegetable market take advantage of this time to transport goods to sell on various roads. Therefore, fishmongers are also gathered here, and 青蘿乾 (preserved radish) and 紫大頭 (purple mustard tuber) are their related businesses.</p>
<p>16 Pu is also the "birthplace" of fruit shops. There are many fruit shops along Dongmen Road 裏馬路 (Inner Horse Road). However, some people say that bananas and sugar cane produced in South Guangdong are found in places like Wusong Road. Buying fruit is indeed cheaper to buy from shops, but that is not always the case. If you know how to buy, you can buy cheaper goods from peddlers. Especially the scales of the shops are so small that it is inexplicable. Approximately, what they call a catty is less than a pound. This situation is not only unavoidable for fruit shops, but even large domestic goods stores claim that ten catties of oranges cost one yuan, but when re-weighed, it is only about eighty taels, which is even more unbelievably "small." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Market Becomes More Depressed</h3>
<p>(Yongheng Silk Factory Announces Shutdown Again) The local silk factory industry has not seen any improvement in overseas silk sales. Only one or two Bao Tai Shun factories in Nanshi and five single and double yarn silk factories such as 　Cang in Zhabei and Yongheng Fu Hui in Hongkou barely resumed work during the New Year. Unexpectedly, the European and American silk markets continued to be sluggish, with no actual sales. Domestic 　gate sales were sluggish and suffered losses, so it was difficult for the factories to sustain themselves. Yongheng Silk Factory (208 silk machines) on Tianbao Road, Hongkou, announced its shutdown again the day before yesterday. Currently, it is estimated that only four silk factories are operating in the city, including Bao Tai Shun. Among them, Heng Cang and other two factories are still reeling silk for customers with the remaining cocoons. As soon as they are used up, they will have to stop working.</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Silk Waste Exports Decrease Further) Yellow and white silk waste exports are increasingly deteriorating. Exports decreased further last week. Only 537 dan were loaded onto various postal ships to Europe and the United States, of which only 1 dan was loaded to Indian territories.</p>
<p>(European and American Silk Sales Are Unlikely to Improve) The Yokohama Japanese silk market saw uncertain fluctuations in current silk prices. New York standard silk prices remained hovering. Lyon and London prices showed no change. Various silk factories had sufficient silk inventory to meet demand. Telegrams relayed to Shanghai were scarce. Hua 　merchants had difficulty selling silk in their hands at low prices. Market sentiment was pessimistic. Silk sales are unlikely to improve in the short term. Yesterday, only inland silk factories purchased 40 bales of white factory silk. Repayment remained firm.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Things Gentlemen Do</h3>
<p>— Yunfei</p>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition organized by Shanghai grandmothers, wives, and young ladies has an exhibition room called "Model Family." The so-called model family is a magnificent living room and bedroom combined. Looking at the price tags of all the furniture in that room, it costs 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many things these days that are ostensibly designed for the public good, but in reality, they are just things gentlemen do. For example, the above-mentioned case. Its name is the National Goods Exhibition, and its promotional target is the "Model Family." According to common sense, these "national goods" should be national goods that everyone can use, and this model family should at least be a "family" that everyone can "model." However, in fact, the so-called model family requires "furniture worth 1,000 yuan" - things in the world are often so comical. The name may sound good, but the reality is just a set of deceptive tricks.</p>
<p>There are really many such things in society. For example, when it comes to hygiene, a group of people always tells others to have proper nutrition, drink a glass of milk every morning, exercise more, avoid overworking, and go for a walk in the park on Sundays so that their bodies will become stronger. If they get sick, they should see a doctor immediately and never listen to the nonsense of witches and Taoists, offering sacrifices to ghosts and eating elixirs, as this will lead to death. These words sound reasonable enough. But in reality, they can barely afford to eat two large pancakes a day, and it is already difficult to eat some white rice and vegetables, let alone anything like milk. As for work, it is like that of oxen and horses. Exercise and rest are completely out of the question for them. When they get sick, doctors - whether Western or Chinese - are out of reach. Who else can they turn to but witches and Taoists? The reward they require is, in any case, only a few cents or a few hundred cash, which is truly in line with their means. And as for education, people often clamor for universal education, to enable children in rural areas to read. Therefore, they try their best to promote schools in rural areas, and are afraid that farmers will not be able to afford their children's tuition fees and will not send them to school. Therefore, there are also occasionally a few free primary schools set up, with all tuition fees and books provided by the school. Students only need to spend some time studying. This can be considered the utmost benevolence and righteousness towards farmers, and universal education is no longer a problem. But in reality, there are still a large number of farmers who are unwilling to let even one child attend free school. Because they need a child to do the work of one person. When the fields are busy, they need children to help. When they are free, they also need children to gather firewood or herd cattle, which is equivalent to half a worker's work. Asking their children to study is tantamount to taking away half a worker from them. They know the benefits of literacy, but they would rather have their children illiterate than lose half a worker for nothing. As a result, free schools are free schools, farmers are still farmers, and the problem of universal education is still not solved. Other social issues are similar to this everywhere. People always only think from the top, and are unwilling to think from the bottom, so the result is always in vain. In fact, what society needs most at present is not good words like hygiene and education, but the most basic and minimal "eating" problem. Only when the eating problem is solved can we talk about other things. At present, they don't even have food to eat. Where do they have the mood to think about things other than eating? However, how can we make them have food to eat? The general upper class in society does not think about this. They only know how to stand on high ground and sing high-sounding tunes, saying cool words.</p>
<p>I remember that there was a great famine in France many years ago, and many people starved to death. The French princess said that it was easy to relieve the famine, so how could people starve to death? Although this is a folk legend and may not be reliable, it also shows that the rich do not know the suffering of the poor. The gap between them is truly beyond expectation. Most of the social undertakings that the ladies and gentlemen are pursuing at present are also like the cold sickness that Lü Mengzheng pointed out.</p>
<p>A certain important person once said such a sentence. He said that it is wrong for us to learn from the United States now. The United States is a rich country, and we are a poor country. We can only do things the poor way. If we learn from the United States, the result will be that nothing will be done well. These few words are very meaningful. I also want to quote his words now, what we need to solve most urgently now is the problem of everyone having food to eat, not the social undertakings in the mouths of you adults and gentlemen - if you really want to run social undertakings, then please start from this aspect first. We don't need the games that gentlemen play at all now.</p>
<h3>The Three Lines of Literati</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>"A good article is good in itself" is the most common saying among Chinese people. This saying fully reveals the self-pride and arrogance of Chinese literati. Originally, China has vast land, magnificent mountains and rivers, and at the same time, among the 400 million people, those who are literate - this refers to non-illiterate, not literati - according to last year's statistics, only account for 10%. From this point of view, the self-pride and arrogance of literati is actually promoted by the natural and social environment, and it is not the fault of the literati themselves.</p>
<p>The self-pride and arrogance of literati is not necessarily based on their "one word is worth a thousand gold" mentality. If literati should be self-proud and arrogant just because they know how to write a few words, then why do the literary beggars in Shanghai and Nanjing kneel on the roadside and write long self-descriptions with chalk for the appreciation of many "passing gentlemen," but the price they get is only dozens of copper coins, which is not enough to fill their stomachs? From this, we can know that the self-pride and arrogance of literati has other reasons.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The self-pride and arrogance of literati lies in three lines. What are the three lines? They are "I'm good, you're not good, and he's not good either." Here, "good" does not mean the meaning of walking, but is a hidden word for "good." The so-called "I'm good, you're not good, and he's not good either" seems to mean "My work is good, yours is not good, and his is not good either," or "I can write good articles, you can't, and he can't either." When I was young, I studied and was also listed among the literati. I often hung out with literati. When literati saw the books displayed on my bookshelf, they suddenly pointed to a certain book and said "not good," and then pointed to another book and said "also not good." In their words, it seemed that only they themselves were "good." Are today's critics any different? In their writing, none of other people's articles are "good." In their words, it seems that only their own articles are "good." A literati all hold the "I'm good" ideology in the three lines, so Chinese literati all "become good"! All literati have studied rhetoric, so their sentence-making can be just right. Although literati hold the "I'm good" ideology, they never announce "I'm good" to the public. What they announce to the public is "you're not good" or "he's not good either," because "you're not good" and "he's not good either" are equal to "I'm good." This is like A squared times B squared equals C squared in algebra. But once a certain literati with the "I'm good" ideology is fortunately valued, then we "not good" literati all eagerly hope for the appearance of a great work by that certain literati. Unexpectedly, the great work of that certain literati is again listed as "not good" in the writing of many critics, so another certain literati with the "I'm good" ideology rises up to succeed him. They fall and stand in turn, and as a result, everyone is a "genius," and everyone is a "feeble-minded child." So far, we have not found a real "I'm good" writer in these three lines.</p>
<p>This is the great transformation of the Chinese literary world in recent years, and it is also the strange phenomenon of the Chinese literary world in recent years.</p>
<h3>Waiting</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>It snowed. After several places experienced warmth, it finally snowed today. Flurries of snowflakes fell from the sky, landing on my disheveled hair and the fur collar of my coat. Gusts of northwesterly wind roared straight at my face. I could only bury my head deeper into my coat collar, my two frozen, red hands tucked into my sleeves. Ferries arrived every ten minutes. I don't know how many sailed past, but I patiently waited, waiting for her, that bird-like person, in the intensifying northwesterly wind.</p>
<p>"Today is Sunday. Her school has a day off, and I just called her. I distinctly heard her say she'd be here soon in the oriole-like voice coming from the receiver. Why does she always make me wait and never come?" I thought to myself.</p>
<p>A large group of people poured out of the small ferry. The little boat wheezed and slowly carried another group away. I stood alone on the dock, feeling desolate and forlorn! I shivered, feeling a chill in my soul. Seeing the rolling waves in the Huangpu River, surging wildly as large ships passed, and the restless ripples on the water's surface in the harbor, I grew fearful. I worried that the large waves would pull me into the whirlpool of the deep abyss. Minutes and seconds ticked by. I watched my watch, which told me it was twelve o'clock. I silently counted in my head; I had been waiting here for a full three hours.</p>
<p>A rickshaw flew from the distance. I strained my eyes, and indeed, there was a girl on the rickshaw. I suspected it was her, but as the rickshaw reached me, the puller's strong legs carried it past me with relentless speed. I began to curse the rickshaw puller for being so heartless and cruel. Why didn't he bring my girl? Even so, I didn't lose hope.</p>
<p>"Did something happen? Is she not coming? Isn't that too unexpected?..." I dared not think that. I hoped my thoughts were just the result of oversensitivity.</p>
<p>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, the sound of leather shoes approached from behind. I believed it was her, but I still didn't dare turn around, afraid of another disappointment.</p>
<p>Another thirty minutes passed. I was really getting impatient. So, I walked against the wind towards the Bu's Stou sign, because she would definitely arrive on the × route bus. Patiently waiting, before long, a bus arrived, packed with a crowded mass of passengers. Peering in, I saw only dark heads. So, I craned my neck, perked up my spirits, and watched the passengers pouring out of the bus door. Alas! Where was she? Where could I find her shadow? Bus after bus arrived. Four buses, five buses. In the end, ah, I fell deeply into the bitter realm of disappointment.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, I slowly walked back to the dock. The wind whipped my head, causing it to ache. My limbs were frozen stiff, and my lower body felt especially weak, almost collapsing. The strange wind accompanying the waves on the river transformed the passionate heart I had maintained for an hour into one of ice. Ah! She was toying with me, letting me down. So, I resolutely bought a ticket, enduring the pain, and walked onto the ferry. I stared at the center of the river, staring at the towering waves. I drifted along the vast river with the boat, my own melancholy reaching a state of utter emptiness!</p>
<p>Ah! Her! Where has that bird-like person gone?</p>
<h3>The New Bride</h3>
<p>— Yu Gui</p>
<p>The flames in the fireplace surged warmly from the fire door, naturally warming the room and making one forget that it was a bitterly cold, snowy day with frozen bodies on the roads. However, our Miss Manli, sitting by the fireplace, did not find her heart warming along with the room; it was cold like a snowflake. She was silent, and it was already past midnight, almost the next day.</p>
<p>The light in the room was so bright, illuminating all the furniture: the new copper bed, the new wall decorations, and especially the new wedding photo. If Miss Manli could just lift her head slightly, we could easily guess from the wedding photo that she was a new bride.</p>
<p>Speaking of Miss Manli's reputation, she occupied a significant place in the minds of many young people. She was the queen of the girls' school, an angel-like celestial being. Regarding marriage, our Miss Manli had many virginal dreams. She rejected the attentiveness of every young man, believing herself to be a swallow soaring in the sky, not a lark that could be confined to a gilded cage. Her ideal mate was still in her beautiful dreams, yet—she had become a new bride.</p>
<p>Outside the window, snowflakes fell like goose feathers, and Miss Manli's heart felt as heavy as lead. She raised her head, her gaze flicking over the wedding photo. She couldn't believe that the man in a formal suit standing beside her would be the gilded cage of her life. Then, the faces of all the young men swept before her, her virginal dreams completely shattered. She resented herself for lacking courage. She could have casually chosen an attentive young man to escape from her mother's grasp, regardless of the outcome. She was destined to be a commodity, sold to you, sold to him, until her body was completely sold off. Yet—she was that man's legal wife.</p>
<p>Manli shook her head wildly, thinking she could cast off the chaotic thoughts, but the faces of many young men swept even more enthusiastically before her. She jumped up as if in a frenzy and threw herself onto the bed. She covered her face with her hands, her legs dangling off the edge of the bed. She didn't cry; she couldn't cry. Suddenly, the clock struck five times, hitting her heart like a hammer.</p>
<p>"Ah, he's not coming back!" she lamented as if complaining to the young men sweeping before her.</p>
<p>She sat up and laughed heartily. Naturally, Miss Manli couldn't think of anything worth laughing about at this moment, just like a newly widowed woman who cries out loud in the quiet of the night to relieve the resentment in her chest. Indeed, after laughing aloud, she recognized that she was on that new copper bed, a new bed with beautiful tassels, a new bed where she lost her virginal dreams, and also a new bed where her life's fate had been decided.</p>
<p>Miss Manli didn't believe for a moment that she could move from the sofa to the bed. So, she laughed again, raising her clenched fist and waving it vigorously in the air.</p>
<p>"I'll break free from this gilded cage!" The voice was as loud as a slogan shouted at a rally. Miss Manli was now like a fierce beast in a wild mountain, baring her claws and teeth, searching for the man in the formal suit. But in the room, besides the flames in the fireplace surging warmly from the fire door, she had no object for her pleasure.</p>
<p>She quickly climbed onto the chair, raised the wedding photo, and threw it into the fireplace. She laughed loudly, clapping her hands, as if she had killed the man in the formal suit.</p>
<p>She had won; she needed rest. She fell onto the copper bed. Instantly, countless young men's heads gathered. Miss Manli looked at the beautiful tassels. She sat up again, wanting to throw herself into their arms. She had broken through the tiger's mouth of the gilded cage. She suddenly lunged forward...</p>
<p>"Falling asleep at a time like this!" A rough voice, like a flying bullet, shattered her eardrums.</p>
<p>Opening her eyes, the man in the formal suit scowled.</p>
<p>Two clear tears hung from Miss Manli's eyes as she stared at the wedding photo. "You are a new bride!" The heads of countless young men mocked her.</p>
<h3>A Small Variety Show</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>The middle school students have been busy with everything for the past eight days. It turned out it's because they are holding a small variety show on Saturday. So, they were busy printing admission tickets, and others were busy writing notices. Some were practicing plays, while others were making red and green paper flowers, doing this, doing that, running east and west, busy and happy! Their thoughts converged on the small variety show that would open on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The reason is that the fifth graders also held such a small variety show last Saturday. Therefore, the students in the junior middle school department, not wanting to be outdone, also did the same thing. They thought: how can we, dignified middle school students, be inferior to these primary school students? So, we can conclude that the motive and origin of their organizing this variety show was to show off their middle school student status and compete with the elementary school department, although their only proclaimed purpose was to discuss academic studies and cultivate group life.</p>
<p>"When you see others have strengths, you should catch up and learn from them. You must not be jealous, but you should have a competitive spirit." That's what I heard teachers say to me often when I entered school, and now that I am in the position of a teacher, I say the same to my students.</p>
<p>The date of the fifth grade variety show was only five or six days ago, so I can still clearly remember what happened that day:</p>
<p>I took on the responsibility of being the class teacher of the fifth grade. At the request of the fifth-grade students, I finally planned everything for them and was able to hold an extremely small variety show with only a prototype last week. In addition to complying with the students' wishes and not disappointing them too much, the only purpose was to let them know more about common sense and the proceedings of meetings, because most of them are children of workers and lack knowledge in all aspects. Borrowing curtains and dance costumes, a small stage was built, and representatives from each grade were invited as usual (in fact, the number of people in each grade exceeded the number of representatives). When the time came, the bell rang to start the meeting. In a small classroom, only black heads could be seen. Everyone squeezed together, making the small classroom unbearably crowded. As usual, after the ceremony, the program began to perform. When the performance started, apart from the junior children who poked out their eyes and watched the stage with relish, the rest yelled out "Bravo!" in strange voices after each act, some even laughing coldly in their noses with a mocking tone. So, the noise in the room was endless. That headache-inducing thing had only passed for less than a week, and the middle school students were also busy trying to play this game. Wouldn't their result be the same?</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Leave</h3>
<p>— Where to Go</p>
<p>Sitting in the classroom for too long, my buttocks can't help but feel sore and swollen. Looking at books for too long, my brain can't help but feel dizzy. So, I casually think about going outside for a walk, taking a look here, taking a look there, in order to relax and regulate the life of a scholar. Isn't that something that is very natural and in accordance with human feelings?</p>
<p>However, the school rules clearly don't take these into account. Students must not be absent from class without a reason, and absenting from class results in no credits, and no credits mean no graduation. All kinds of things restrict students from leaving school. So, isn't it also natural for students to take leave and go out for a stroll?</p>
<p>Taking leave should be for something. However, things like sitting for too long and getting sore buttocks are difficult for people to acknowledge. So, isn't it also a matter of not being able to help oneself to lie and say that one is sick, or that something has happened at home, and so on, and then taking that leave slip to leisurely stroll around?</p>
<p>Leisurely strolling around with a lie is inherently forbidden. But luckily, this is for one's own health. Because getting sore buttocks is bound to lead to ulceration, and getting dizzy too often is bound to lead to meningitis. When such disasters befall, people at most say a word of respect, or how rare it is, and other similar words of regret, but one's own self is needlessly ruined. Thinking about it, how unwise is that?</p>
<p>So, those who take leave for the sake of their health and go out to relax always understand the way to preserve life and know how to plan for themselves.</p>
<p>Politicians who sit in the court and think about and worry about the affairs of the country as if they were their own also often have this kind of health problem.</p>
<p>It is very common and frequent for politicians to have health problems, and there is no need to be surprised. Why? Because politicians are also people, and people are often sick.</p>
<p>People generally think that great people are like supermen. In fact, great people are just superior to others in terms of planning and superior to others in terms of skills, but in terms of physiology, they are just like ordinary people.</p>
<p>If they are like ordinary people, they will have the same health problems as ordinary people. What's more, they are so busy planning for the country and so hardworking doing things for the country. If you are busy enough and work hard enough, wouldn't you get sick?</p>
<p>So, isn't it also most in accordance with human feelings for politicians to reluctantly leave the court for the sake of their own health problems and take sick leave to recuperate?</p>
<p>Those who spare no effort to take leave and recuperate for the sake of their own health are always those who have attained the true essence of life. It is proper for us ordinary people to emulate, admire, and admire them.</p>

<h3>Xin'er (New Child)</h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>"Xin'er, Daddy is home! Hurry and get up!" The mischievous six-year-old Xin'er, not having had enough to eat for breakfast, threw himself on the ground and cried for a long time. His mother tried to coax him, but he ignored her. Scolding and hitting him didn't scare him. But the moment he heard that shout, he immediately scrambled up, covered in dust, and threw himself into his mother's arms, calling out in a childlike voice like a singing oriole:</p>
<p>"Mother, Daddy's home! Let's go meet him!" Xin'er jumped up impatiently, pulling on his mother's sleeve, insisting on going outside to meet his daddy.</p>
<p>This was Xin'er's third hope.</p>
<p>The first time was during the New Year. He said to his mother that he was six years old this year and wanted to have a new set of clothes made. His mother, unable to bear his pestering, simply agreed: "When March comes and the cotton is harvested, I'll definitely make them for you!" Xin'er then lived in hope, going to the fields every day to look at the cotton. When one or two branches formed buds, he would rush home, excitedly telling his mother and proposing the making of new clothes. Later, the weather was constantly drizzling, and Xin'er didn't go to see the cotton seedlings for ten days. But he heard his father always getting angry with his mother: "Damn it, with this kind of incessant rain, the cotton is all withering!" Sure enough, the ten acres of cotton fields didn't yield even two or three loads of dead, yellow flowers. As his mother sorted through them, Xin'er was still nagging her about making new clothes. His mother, annoyed, slapped him twice, and he fell to the ground crying.</p>
<p>Two days later, Xin'er took advantage of the good opportunity of his mother wanting him to get vaccinated against smallpox to bring up the condition of making new clothes. His mother calculated that there was absolutely no income recently, and they couldn't even afford firewood and rice every day, only relying on the new wheat that would come out in May. So, she definitely said to Xin'er: "If you get vaccinated well, and we harvest the wheat in May, I'll definitely tell Daddy to go buy cloth to make them for you." Xin'er was a bit skeptical at first, shaking his head, and said "No, no, the third time was still no. "No, no, no, what do you want?" His mother's anger flared, staring at him with round eyes. "I don't want it, make them now!" "Good boy, there's no money now. I'll definitely make them for you in May!" Xin'er was finally persuaded by his kind mother. "You must make them in May!" "I'll definitely make them for you!" Xin'er then agreed to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Xin'er looked, looked, and May arrived. The weather was good, with favorable winds and rain. The yellow wheat ears swayed steadily in the wind and waves. Xin'er was truly delirious with joy.</p>
<p>Load after load of wheat was carried on his father's shoulders to the threshing ground. Xin'er sat on a low stool to guard against chickens and ducks coming to grab food. The wheat was threshed, piled up like a small, pot-shaped mountain. His father went to town to get someone to buy it. The wheat was sold, and the silver dollars flipped in his father's palm. Xin'er then remembered making new clothes, twisting and turning in front of his mother. His father whispered in his mother's ear: "Ah, the wheat price is so low, this little money isn't even enough to pay off the debt!" His father got angry, and his palm landed on Xin'er's face, and Xin'er cried again.</p>
<p>In July, Xin'er had the desire to make new clothes again. His mother said to him with a grieving heart: "Daddy has gone to town to inquire about the grain price. This time, if all twelve loads of new grain are sold, I'll definitely make a set for you!" Xin'er then hoped wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Because he didn't have enough breakfast, Xin'er threw himself on the ground and cried for a long time. No matter how hard they tried to coax him, they couldn't get him to get up. "Xin'er, Daddy's home! Hurry and get up!" Only this made Xin'er scramble up at once.</p>

<h3>How to Dissolve an Engagement Arranged by Parents?</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>When I was a child, my parents arranged an engagement for me with Miss Yi. At first, I strongly protested, but because I lacked the ability, I had to obey my parents' arrangements. It wasn't until 1928 that I grew older and gained some knowledge, and I repeatedly protested this marriage to my parents. My parents ignored me, but a year later, the Yi family unfortunately suffered a sudden misfortune, and their parents all fled to escape disaster. Miss Yi was left without anyone to care for her, so my parents brought Miss Yi to temporarily care for her. Although I repeatedly opposed this matter, it was always ineffective. My parents have been taking care of Miss Yi to this day and also know that Miss Yi has a bad temper, so they sympathize with me. However, the Yi family parents returned home in 1931, but Miss Yi still remains in our care and has always opposed the dissolution of the engagement. Now, although my parents sympathize with me, they don't know the dissolution procedures, and all the responsibility is still on my shoulders, but I also lack the ability. So, I can only ask you to guide and answer the following question:</p>
<p>A, Can I use the following three points as reasons for dissolving the engagement?</p>
<p>One, the engagement was arranged by my parents without the consent of the parties involved.</p>
<p>Two, Miss Yi is an old-fashioned woman, illiterate, and her temperament does not match mine.</p>
<p>Three, according to the current slogans of freedom of marriage, freedom of divorce, and freedom of marriage.</p>
<p>B, If I do not marry Miss Yi and freely declare cohabitation with Miss Bing, is this bigamy?</p>
<p>C, If the engagement cannot be dissolved and I publish a statement in the newspaper that I do not recognize the engagement arranged by my parents, is this effective?</p>
<p>D, If I publish a statement in the newspaper that I do not recognize the engagement arranged by my parents, if this method is effective, what responsibility should my parents bear?</p>
<p>E, If the engagement cannot be dissolved and both of us are over twenty years old, but I will never want to marry Miss Yi, will I be subject to legal restraint?</p>
<p>Please give me a satisfactory answer and guidance to the above questions. Completed, best wishes for your health. Jiang Yifan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: According to the provisions of the current Civil Code, "Engagements should be made by the parties themselves." In other words, if the engagement is not made by the male and female parties themselves, it should be invalid. So, your first reason for dissolution is valid. The second and third reasons are not valid, but having the first reason is enough, and there is no need to raise the second and third reasons. Dissolving an engagement requires "filing a lawsuit." If you just publish a statement in the newspaper, I'm afraid it doesn't comply with the procedures. As for your letter's item B, the so-called "freely declaring cohabitation with Miss Bing" is not allowed by law because, before the previous engagement is dissolved, this behavior is illegal. Regarding what responsibility your parents should bear after you dissolve the engagement, according to the main points of the judgment in the case of dissolving an engagement and returning betrothal gifts in the twentieth year (Shang Zi No. 1377), "If parents, based on the power of arranging marriages under the old law, arrange an engagement for their young children, according to the principle of freedom of marriage, if one of their children, after reaching adulthood, is unwilling to fulfill the engagement, they may sue for dissolution, but in the contracting parties, they should not be allowed to change their minds without reason." So, if your parents do not meet the conditions for dissolution prescribed by the Civil Code, they cannot dissolve the engagement without reason. However, "Engagements cannot be forced to be fulfilled" is also clearly stipulated by law. If you insist on dissolving the engagement, it is not impossible, but the other party has "the right to claim damages." There are no special provisions in the law for the E item method, but it allows the other party to dissolve the engagement and claim damages.</p>
<p>In short, this type of incident should be resolved by law, so you must consult a lawyer for all detailed procedures.</p>

<p>You don't need to argue. Do you think running away from your family marriage makes you a progressive figure in the revolution? Since the May Fourth Movement, countless men and women have run away from family marriages. That was just a relic of the family revolution in the initial social movement, not some great action or glorious history. After the May Fourth Movement, the female youths who came out of family revolutions now have three different situations and ideologies. One type struggled and advanced, and now, as virtuous wives and good mothers, they are subdued in their small families. Another type breathed in new ideas at the time and embarked on the revolutionary path, but now, if they haven't died, they've become dejected and pessimistic, indulging in pleasure, detesting the family, and feeling nihilistic about life. || These people are living a slow suicide. There is also a type that held the ambition of economic independence and independent living at the time, and most studied medicine and obstetrics, followed by teaching. Now, as doctors or teachers, their lives are indeed independent, but their youth has passed like flowing water. The pain of being an old maid is only known to themselves.</p>
<p>You are a youth who awakened during the May Thirtieth Movement era, but you only have a simple mind. Therefore, after you came out of the family revolution, you simply struggled for your own future. Therefore, you don't understand political thought, and you hate politics. Therefore, you don't understand the suffering that great figures experience because of political thought. Therefore, you are worried and uneasy, and you cannot live with him and left him.</p>
<p>Manli, this is your mistake!</p>
<p>Now that you've left him, do you feel no regret at all? Do you feel no pain at all? "No, no, although my body has left him, my heart is still thinking of him, and my soul is often flying to find him!" You must tell me this. You must be even more buried in the thick fog of worry and unease!</p>
<p>Manli, then, you should think about your own mistakes: Why didn't you try to understand him?</p>
<p>Do you understand now? The only reason you don't understand him is that your thinking is outdated!</p>
<p>Also, you only see yourself. Apart from yourself, you can't even see your lover. This is naturally your uniqueness, your pride, but also your sorrow. Self-esteem is certainly precious, but self-esteem that expands to infinity becomes a distorted person who is arrogant and self-centered! Extreme individualists, especially women, find it difficult to live happily in modern society!</p>
<p>Don't dream that as long as you work hard and have authority and money, a lover is not a problem. Love, of course, can be plundered with authority, and can also be bought with money, but what you get is not a lover, but a human captive!</p>
<p>You must also remember: New people are not as good as old people, and the first person you love will never be forgotten!</p>
<p>However, if you repent, it is already too late!</p>
<p>Since Renjie came out of the hospital, his temperament, will, thoughts, and concepts have all changed completely.</p>
<p>After a long rain, there will be sunshine. He is precisely a barometer.</p>
<p>That day, I went to find him—the house where you lived—the first thing that surprised me was that he was slow in his movements, looked old, and didn't like to talk much; and from the original expression of indignation, he had lost his disappointment and gained optimism. He had become a resolute and brave warrior.</p>
