<h3 id="c19">匈牙利與中歐霸權彤 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>前日外電稱巴徐論壇。近頗關心於匈牙利國際政策的變化。本年三月間匈牙利和意大利曾成立妥協。其時德意關係。尚稱接近。所以意匈的結合。不足爲異。到了七月二十五日奥國發生政變德意間過去的妥恊基礎。根本上發生動搖。於是匈牙利對外關係的向背。遂成了一個絶大的問題。因爲匈牙利在目前的歐洲政局之下。根本不曾脫離殖民地化的階叚。所以他的國際關係。便不容有中立的餘地。和模稜兩可的態度了。</p>
<p>現在這匈牙利的鹿。究竟將死在誰手呢。這不僅巴黎的論壇。要有（聯意歟？新德歟）的懷疑。卽在旁觀的我們。也要給這處於歐洲霸權國宰制下的九百萬匈牙利人民估量一下。目前匈牙利的國際關係。誠然己經到了一個轉變的重要關頭。據二十四日巴黎電訊。說法外長重返日内瓦。有三大任務。其一卽在於進行保障奥國獨立計劃。法外長爲何如此僕僕道途呢。當然是爲應付德國。而匈牙利問題的如何處置。恐怕也有關係的。</p>
<p>要問匈牙利的對外關係。究竟如何。我們以爲應該由經濟方面觀察。尤其要從匈牙利的國際金融關係觀察。經濟爲大國統治殖民地的主要工具。匈牙利自大戰結束以後。國内人民的經濟生活。幾於盡由大國操縱。因爲財政上收支不敷。外債佔了債務總額的百分之七十。商業金融方面。更加債務纍纍。當一九三一年中歐金融風潮發生時。匈牙利商業銀行共負國外活期債務達八萬萬迸果（丹幣）以上。可想見匈牙利在金融上。己完全成爲歐洲資本輸出國家的附庸。其次就對外貿易方面說。匈牙利雖一方面消納德國貨物。佔全年進口的百分之二十二。但其最大的主顧。却爲他的鄰邦奥大利。約全部出口的百分之三十。這樣便增加了奥大利對於奥牙利人民的需要。總之。由多牙利的國際金融貿易關係。以觀察他的外交路綫。似乎柏林這條路未必有十分成功的希望。更從巴黎方面觀察。都說匈意接近以後。己使兇牙利在經濟上得到無限利益。這雖是法國一方面的宣傳。但是從意大利曾於匈牙利的出海通道上。給予相當便利一點看。則法意努力誘致對匈政治上的接近。當然很有成功的可能性。不過我們以爲匈牙利在德國霸權之下。可以成爲附庸地位。而在法意接近之下。恐怕其地位就要和附庸不同了。能否保持其舊日相當地位。正是難說。是故匈牙利國際政策的變化。確是在中歐糾紛問題中的一重要問題。</p>

<p>船主途中裝病　船主對此事、係根本反對乾、但無法應付、故順安輪於駛出吳淞後、便裝病在船、而將駕駛之事、委托大二副盛復臣、王道基代爲管理、而歐陽泰到船以後、始終未將此事、向船員言及、迨船抵温州海面、大二副向歐陽泰報告航和時、該船主猶未宣布此事、</p>
<p>自首三都澳關　至本月十八日、順安輪行駛至三都澳、該船主以本輪行將開抵泉州、如果此事不宣布、則所報之出口貨不符、客家勢必追究、如果依陳友伯之毒計炸船、則關係過巨、再四考慮、熟權輕重、遂將此事之詳細原因、盡告大二副盛王二人、並磋商如何應付、三人討論之下、祇得向三都澳海關自首、因將順安輪開至三都澳、卽派大副盛復臣、報告海關、</p>
<p>人船一併扣留　　三都澳海關據報後、以情節十分重大、立卽將順安輪扣留、並將船主歐陽泰亦扣在關、所有陳友伯圖炸全輪之炸藥并爲起出、卽行密電上海澈究此案、查順安輪中所裝者、麵粉最多、次爲荳麥香烟與疋頭雜貨等項、今亦一併阻留在三都澳、連日客家貨主、紛紛向該公司探詢乾甚多、</p>
<p>陳友伯己被捕　順安輪被扣事發後、滬經理陳友伯得訊、卽乘機潛逃、公司事務停頓、同時該公司董事長鄭仲武、對經理不端行爲、於公司信譽掃地、特派員赴愛文義路大通路同壽里五十七號陳友伯寓所找尋、亦杳無影踪、是以分向公安局捕房等警務機關、報告跴緝、始於前日下午二時、在盧家灣、由鄭仲武途遇扭獲、送至捕房、公司内祇有職員學生等三數人、其餘重要職員、均己避匿、陳友伯己被押法捕房、將送法庭訊究、</p>
<p>保險聲明退保　順安輪船公司之順安輪、係由愛多亞路三十八號中國船舶保險聯合會承保船險六萬元、該公司並將該輪向静安寺路華安保險公司押欵一萬五千元、據中國保險聯合會經理湯旦華語人、在上前雖未能證實其是否圖詐賠欵、但船員確有互相爭奪之情勢、查輪船航海、非與陸地可比、稍一疏忽、卽有觸礁或沉没之危險、現船員間旣發現此種秘密、聯合會爲免將來糾葛起見、業己聲明退保、一切單據、均宣告作廢、</p>
<p>航局澈查待懲　交通部上海航政局、前日據非正工之報告後、疑信參半、以爲該輪船主歐陽泰秉性忠厚、作事幹練、决無出此串通炸船之不法行爲、嗣後由大副盛復臣之妻挈帶盛氏親律函件、向航政局報告後、昨卽派員赴江海關調查、該輪確被三都澳海關扣留、故航局現正詳查眞相、以便懲處云、</p>

<p>包探與巡捕亦慘死非命</p>
<p>丨兇手逃逸事態嚴重丨</p>
<p>本月十六日晚十一時三十五分、四馬路畫錦里第三十七號愼記謙吉旅館第三十四號房間内曾發生一暗殺案、被害者名熊國華、據稱係台州人、年三十四歲、當時報傷勢尚無大碍、故經送山東路仁濟醫院醫治後、漸見痊可、各情己詳本報、詎昨日下午、竟在醫院内仍被槍殺、並害及探捕各一名、茲將各情詳誌於下、</p>
<p>熊國華　　當本月十六日晚、熊國　　傷己大愈　華在謙吉旅館第三十四號房間内、被兩匪徒賺開房門、遭遇槍擊後、卽倒地不省人事、該館賬房乃急卽報告捕房、立派中西探捕前往查勘、一面將熊國華車送山東路仁濟醫院救治、當由該院送之入第一層樓第一百四十五號病房第十八號病床上、經醫師檢騐後、察得共傷三處、一在嘴部、一在頸根、一在右胸、惟尚無十分大碍、故經將子彈箝出、悉心診療後、傷勢己漸平復、並不久卽可出院矣、但當時捕房方面、以斯案兇犯未獲、而熊之來踪去跡、亦頗可疑、故每日特撥派包探三名、輪流駐院監視、以防萬一、</p>
<p>出手槍　昨日下午三時、仁濟醫</p>
<p>代探病券　院以己屆規定探病時間、乃將大門開放、任探病者魚貫進内、惟爲防止閒雜人等　見、特爲探病者製發一種探病證券、憑此方可進内、法至良善、詎至三時四十分許、又來男子四名、兩穿中山裝、一穿黑長衫、一穿藍布長衫、年約二三十歲左右、前往該院、直闖進内、當時該院賬房間門口檢劵者卽向其索取憑證、該四男子置之不理、直往内走、檢劵者以其破壞定規、乃將彼等攔阻、正擾攘間、該四男子竟各出手槍、向檢券者示威、並揚言（此卽門券）、隨卽由兩男子押其退入帳房間、連同帳房間電話間内職員等、一併看守、不許動彈、一面將電話機阻塞、斷絶通話、</p>
<p>中兩彈　尚有兩男子、卽於斯時　　一命嗚呼　直上第一層樓闖入第一百四十五號病房、走近第二十八號病床時、熊國華尚臥於床上、忽見有人進内、正擬叩問時、該兩男子卽袖出手槍、各向其開放一槍、均在頭部及腦部、熊以猝不及防、况又傷勢方復、無力抵抗、故竟束手就斃、鮮血腦漿、汚及滿床、該兩男子見目的己達、卽反身出房而逸、當時隔室病人等驟聞槍聲、咸驚魂不定、而其他職員等、則又無法擒獲、乃祇得任其由石梯飛奔下樓而逸、</p>
<p>范永泉　當斯時、該負責監視熊　　死於非命　國華之老閘捕房第二百五十三號包探范永泉、清江人、適在樓下會客室内閒坐、忽聞槍聲起自第一百四十五號内、知事不妙、乃急拔出所佩手槍、走出會客室、但斯時兩兇手己奔至樓下小花園旁、與帳房間内兩男子會合、范意爲樓上逃避下樓者、故毫不起疑、仍向該男子迎面走去、詎其所持槍械、己被彼等瞥見、持者無心、見者有意、意爲范己識破彼等舉動、乃竟各持手槍、齊對范探指住喝令停步、高舉兩手、范探猝不及防、無從抵抗、乃祇得依之舉手、詎一霽那間、無情槍彈、己似連珠而發、中在范探胸部、應聲倒地、鮮血直冐、頓時身死、</p>
<p>一巡捕　但禍起竟有出乎意料者　　死出意外　、當范探被殺、兇犯尚未逸出該院時、法捕房方面、適發生一毆鬥案、被傷者名楊玉麟、惟傷勢甚輕、乃命第七百二十一號巡捕護送至仁濟醫院求治、進門後、該楊玉麟卽獨自經小花園旁步往診療室就診、法華捕在後、相距約十碼許、跟隨而入、兇犯等一見、認作前來逮捕者、卽一擁上前、又將法華捕喝住、該第七百二十一號法華捕見狀、情知不妙、况又赤手空拳、奚能抵抗、亟反身圖逸、但兇手四人己由其身後發槍、計發三槍、胥被命中、貫穿前胸、隨亦倒於小花園旁、氣絶身死、四兇犯旣殺三人、己如入無人之境、乃從容逸出醫院、分散奔命、及捕房得報、趕派全班中西武裝探捕趕到四去追緝、則早己鴻飛冥冥、乃亟通知法捕房將第七百二十一號華捕屍身先行車送騐屍所、入晚續將范·熊·兩屍送往騐屍所、待今晨報請法院檢騐、並通知全市警政機關請予一體協助、追捕在逸兇犯、</p>

<p>虚事擴張　　以吸收現金維持裝璜華麗再利用廣告宣傳、祇須存洋五十元、無須擔保、便得領用支票簿、在社會上使用實開滬上銀行界空前未有之特例、又以五年計畫儲蓄·十年計晝儲蓄·新生活儲蓄·等巧立名目、以優厚利率廣告爲號召、詎料該分行不及一載、支行僅及兩月、而同時倒閉、則自訴人等信託之五年計畫·十年計畫金按月業己繳付、而被告等竟違背五年·十年·之任務、猝然閉歇、致令儲户己繳付之金額、盡爲被告等或三人不法之所有、同時儲户受有損害、足見當初（見本年六月二十一日該行開業各報廣告）及五年十年計畫其他高利儲蓄章程、均爲吸收現金之工具圖得不法利益之手段、該被告等實犯刑法第三百六十六條之背信罪、（二）按五華銀行八仙橋支行、於本年八月二十一日倒閉之、</p>

<p>答徐思</p>
<p>徐君來信說，他看見一篇文章，臺面講；一自然科學發生在先，社會科學成立在後。所以没有自然科學的根基而亂講社會科學。所謂社會科學仍是一種玄學······殊不知所謂社會科學中的種種理論基礎，都是由自然科學而來。若連自然科學的基本知識都不懂，則社會科學何能了解。）徐君因爲自己的自然科學知識很淺薄，看了這段文章，很懷欵自己是否有研究自然科學的資格。現在且先答覆他這一疑點罷！</p>
<p>（自然科學發生在先，社會科學成立在後）這話是眞的。眞正的社會科學只有幾十年來才有，自然科學却在二千年以前便己萌芽了。但這發生的時間之先後，並不能就因此證明社會科學是直接由自然科學的地點上生長起來。自然，我們不能否認自然科學與社會科學有着一定的關係，社會科學中的許多法則，必須用自然科學的知識去帮着解釋，但社會現象究竟是社會現象，無自然現象根本有着不同的地方，社會發展的一切法則與自然現象生變化也决不能看做同一件事，我們解釋社會現象時，如果太偏重目然科學，就要陷入錯誤。例如用法理學中性慾來解釋社會現象，說某國的滅亡是爲了一個女人的爭奪，用地理學來解釋人類社會，說古代北方的强悍是由於氣候寒冷等，都是以自然現象解釋社會現象的錯誤。因爲國家的滅亡，眞正的原因是由於經濟的力量不足以抵抗外來的侵略者，古代北方人的强悍好鬭，是由於他們遊牧生活的困難的經濟情形所逼近成的。社會現象有社會現象目己的法則，這一點是先要認清楚的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c161">婦女服用國貨社的倡議 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 陳雪芷女士</p>
<p>婦女國貨年己經過去半年多了；在這過去半年中的成績怎樣，現在我們暫且不論，致於未來幾個月中的工作，我們眞應該怎樣的努力幹一下呵！</p>
<p>前天報載婦女國貨年運動委員會開設計七作經濟三委會聯席會議，討論下半年度工作綱要；雖然現在有些報紙都在向該會以及我們女界下總攻擊令，但我總覺得幹國貨事業幹總比不幹來得好些，老實說，婦女國貨年運動委員會上半年度的七作也可算得努力的了！假使要想把這驚人的入超數額的責任完全擔到我們婦女們的肩上，也未免太過火些了！入超自有其復雜的原因存在着，眞非我們的能力所能把它去除的，但我們幹還是要幹，决不能因了這件事情而灰心的呢！</p>
<p>無論幹件什麽事情，一定要它立刻看見効力，這當然是很難，不過影響到將來的効力却拫大；幹國貨事業也未嘗不是如此，所以我們祇要埋下頭來猛幹，其効力如何，將來自然會顯在我們目前的！</p>
<p>現在眞是婦女國貨年下半年度工作開始的時候，我因爲也是女界的一份子，所以不自藏拙的來貢獻一些意見，不知道該會是否能够採納？</p>
<p>我們幹一件事，總希望它有些實際性，所以我覺得現在亟應組織一個婦女服用國貨社，一方面是因爲它富於實際性的，另一方面也可作爲婦女國貨年的永久紀念，現在把組織婦女服用國貨社的幾個要點寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）以提倡國貨，發展國民經濟，并養成國民服用國貨的習慣爲宗旨。</p>
<p>（二）社員不限資格，一槪歡迎加入。</p>
<p>（三）社員除了無國貨替代的必需品外，不得購買或服用洋貨。</p>
<p>（四）凡社員均須負担下列諸工作：</p>
<p>（甲）介紹同胞入社。</p>
<p>（乙）宣傳國貨。</p>
<p>（丙）調查國貨的名稱商標及製造廠名。</p>
<p>（丁）組織國貨商店。</p>
<p>（戊）隨時隨地組織分社。</p>
<p>我這理想中的婦女眼服用國貨社是可大可小，大可大到如創辦各種提倡國貨的機關和中國國貨公司小可小到二三個朋友結合起來，相約一致服用國發，我的希望是人人憑着能力之所及，做一點發展國民經濟的事，尤其是己經覺悟了的智識份子，應先做起，因爲智識份子對外貨傾銷的毒策看得清楚，當然要負起先覺覺後覺的責任，來努力的幹一下呢！</p>
<p>貢献話</p>
<h3 id="c162">秋來了 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>秋來了，人們對於衣食住上的需要，當然又須變换一個環境。讀者不信，試往各國貨公司商店去一看，肩摩轂擊，鬢影衣香，來來往往的都是採辦秋令用品的人，尤其都是操持家政的主婦太太。當這婦女國貨年中，以婦女而採辦國貨，眞是最摩登最適宜的事情。所以有人說，中國前途，確有幾分光明的希望，儘有日人推銷貨品，儘是廣設日貨商塲，儘是奸商販賣日貨，可是知識在水平綫以上的人，没有一個不想用國貨，辦國貨，信仰國貨的。可見以後國貨的推行，比較上要感受許多的便利。不過人心日壞，作僞太多，一般愛國的樂用國貨的女太太，小姐們，要注意下列四點。</p>
<p>（一）買國貨，要到有信用有聲譽的國貨工廠和國貨公司去。</p>
<p>（二）買國貨須認清有歷史有成績的商標式樣，不致受人欺騙朦混。</p>
<p>（三）買國貨須具决心和犧牲心，然後才可得到成效。</p>
<p>（四）買國貨時，萬一發現了一件非國貨，千萬不要姑息容忍，使奸商得售其計。</p>
<p>（五）買國貨時，要想到買一件國貨物品，便是替國家增進一分生産力量。如果不謹愼，買了一件仇貨，好似送去了許多子彈。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c163">從積極方面想幾個補救辦法 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 劍花女士</p>
<p>婦女愛美的特性是天賦的。並且是根深蒂固牢不可拔的，你如不信。且到馬路上或遊戲塲中去看看不要說有幾分姿色的女子。個個喜歡塗脂抹粉畫眉毛染指甲。就是有許多麻臉螺眼秃頂豁牙的無鹽嫫母。明明妝扮出來愈形其醜。但她們還要拚命地搽脂粉。綣頭髮，灑香水。塗口紅。自以爲嬌艶動人哩。這種自憐自愛的心理。差不多每個女子都有。大有（寗使胸無點墨，不可面無脂粉，）之槪，所以近數月來，無論怎樣文字諷勸。口頭說法。說化妝品進口那麽那麽多。勸她們怎樣怎樣勿用洋貨。她們祇是（充耳不聞）。脂粉香水依然有加無己地進口。因此我感覺到消極的阻止。是不生効力的。還是從積極勸用國貨方面想想補救辦法吧！</p>
<p>中國的化妝用品。在近年來，不算没有進步了，牙粉牙膏等類。除却一般貴族階級。以爲不用牠不算闊氣以外。普通大多數用的是永和實業公司嫦娥牌家庭工業社無敵牌或中國化學工藝社三星牌等的牙粉牙膏了。以我們家裏。和幾個至戚而論。除了至不可少的藥品外。其他是絶對不用外貨的。化妝用品，乃是無敵三星固本等牌十餘年來的老主顧。尤其是無敵牌出品。因爲發明者是文學家而科學家而兼實業家的天虚我生。我們最信任他所監製有東西。如脂粉雪花牙粉等品，决無傷害皮膚。捐及齒牙等弊病。並且我們每次到他發行所裏去參觀的時候。總覺一次有一次的進步。各項貨品，不但實質方面，時有改善。裝璜方面。也日新月異。力求美化。的確可與外貨媲美。其他如五洲中央等廠的香胰。三星牌的牙膏雪花等。都和舶來品不相上下。我很希望姊妹們不妨多多購用。一方是提倡國貨。一方可不再擔當洋貨推銷員的罪名。另一方面。可以看不到化妝品進口驚人的數字。一舉而三得。我想妝妹們一定樂予實行的吧！不過在這裏我得聲明一下。我祇是個愛用國貨者。對以上各廠家並無廣告作用。我所要列舉數家牌號的意思。就是因爲姊妹們祇知洋貨某牌某號的可靠。尚未知道國貨究竟孰優孰劣。故敢依我經騐介紹幾種此較可靠的請姊妹們購用。最後以後如有人把日用所需的東西以何廠出品爲優。列表發表於本刋，（須絶對不含廣告性質）使愛用國貨者知所適從。這倒也是推廣國貨的一種方法。</p>
<p>臨了我還希望許多對於製造化妝用品最優良的各廠商。請與永安先施麗華新新等各大公司聯手起來。各廠精選大批貨品送往各公司陳列。並優予利益。使廣爲宣傳。一般婦女大都喜往公司購物。公司中外貨居多。遂相率購用外貨。如果讓她們一進門就看到琳琅滿目的都是上等國貨。就可把他們的視綫和信心吸引過來了。各大廠家何妨嘗試一下呢！</p>

<p>— 丁杏</p>
<p>（······在塲的諸位伯叔兄弟姊妹，有誰肯讓你的親屬被人奪去殺死或受辱，假使是眞的發生了這種情形，又有那個不肯用力去援救呢？現在我就是拿中國國境之内的土地，來譬喻到一人的親屬，東北四省在九一八給日本人不費吹灰之力的在一更之間，輕輕的奪去，我們竟然一些没有辦法來擔禦它，有一般靑年志士，以及東北義勇軍，不惜犠牲了血肉之軀，供日人的槍砲，我以爲這種無謂的犧牲，也可說是没有多大的價值，假如有了充分的準備，確有制敵的可能，那麽還不妨去攻克一下，現在呢，那一方面能够談得到，這樣說來，難道我們就無聲無嗅地過去了嗎？不丨不！我們應當大家起來幹一件事，比用槍砲來打它們還要利害，一方面，有資本的，應當集合資本來廣設國發并廠，以事生産；一方面，凡屬中國人大家都應當服用國貨，這樣的持之以恒，五年十年的下去，那時候，中國的市塲之上，找不到一些外貨，我想它們雖然强横，因了失却一個専銷貨品大市塲的好機會，是根本動搖了，呌它們來侵略，也没有力量了，簡單說來，它們利有了它們國家生産過剩，把生産過剩的貨品，儘量的推銷到我國來，我國人大家購買它，大好的金錢，流到外洋去，這就是供給它們造槍製砲的大量資本，假如像我前面所說，中國人一致服用中國貨，還怕它們幹什麽？······）那時候，萬頭攅動的凝神一志的静聽着。</p>
<p>（諸君！理滋四省己去了。在最近時期之内，我想决計不會得歸還我們，除非自己努力前途，到了後來，它們屈服了以後，自然而然的會得物歸原主的來歸還，這就全仗我們大衆的努力，一這是民國二十年，九一八事發之後的事。</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3 id="c165">國際専門技術敎育會决議之要案 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>國際専門技術敎育會議、係由法比英德意西班牙埃及波蘭等國所組織、會長爲法國著名學者那貝氏、（Ｌabbe）去歲曾在巴黎開成立大會、本年五月十七日在西班牙柏士羅納、（Ｂancelone）開第二次國際大會、曾經函邀我國參加、祇因限於經濟時間未派代表、但敎部於去歲己派高等敎育司科長謝樹英爲通訊員、隨時與國際敎育局溝通消息、（該局注意國際敎育消息、謝君正搜集材料、以便向該局通訊、）該會閉會後、頃由國際専門技術敎育局、將大會决議各要案、函達敎育部、原文翻譯甚長、茲探錄其概要於下、</p>
<p>（一）職業敎育之趨勢　國際専門技術敎育會議、（以下簡稱該會）認爲専門敎育與職業敎育在經濟立塲上與社會立塲上非常重要、適合現代生活之需求、是以文明各國莫不以此項職業敎育列入發展計劃之方案中、希望此類敎育、在各國獲得其應有之地位、</p>
<p>（二）職業指導辦法　該會因有一部份國家之學制、於規定兒童就學及許何工作年齡、尚未與國際勞工會議所提倡兒童工作之許可年齡相吻合、一方面希望専門敎育機關、要求當局對於兒童工作年齡有相當之規定、立即實行、一方面於義務敎育期間之各學年、除授兒童必要之普通敎育外、並當敎以工作技能　俾兒童具備選擇技藝與職業之能力、</p>
<p>専門學校與職業界應力謀溝通聯絡、以便將來職業設科隨時代需要而更攺、而勞工方面立法、應規定凡少年工人‘必須完成職業敎育、</p>
<p>國際専門技術敎育局、應將實質或精神方面感覺有缺憾之職業敎育問題、付之研究、並調查各國能解决此問題之辦法、以補救缺憾、</p>
<p>該會深恐職業指導之結果、仍不能使出校學生有所依歸、因是希望各地借重官廳力量、在國家法律許可範圍内、組織若干機關、收容己離小學、而有志學習技藝者、予以就業上之指導、並誠愼行使監護人職務、迄學習期間、終了而止、</p>
<p>（三）學習與失業問題　學習方面技術學圖案、案與工廠實習、三者應亟相聯繫、宜加增實習工作、期敏捷製造有用物品、該會委員會、希望下次大會時、乘便創設課程作品展覧會藉以觀摩、</p>
<p>該會鑒於失業於國家文化上發生極嚴重之危險故、决議採用各種有效方法如（職業敎育力求適應環境）（創辦特種工塲培養職業人才等、以防免各種失業之恐慌、</p>
<p>（四）高等専門敎育問題　該會認高等専門敎育之工程師、得由各種方法造就之但均須經過充分修業年限、受過相當普通敎育　具有工程師一般必修之専門學識、此外並須學有専長、僉認工程師之培養當在有科學訓練之學校中行施之、</p>
<p>該會並鑒於技術人材數量日增、其間程度高下不齊、以及各技士謀業之艱難、遂决定高等技術専門學校招生採嚴格主義　頒發畢業文憑須受政府嚴密之監督、有一部分自修自學之人、須學力能力合格、方得請領工程師證書、同時對於工程師之出路、考量産業界之需要、謀適當之供求比例、</p>
<p>該會對於高等敎育之管理與保護工程師名位之研討、僉以工程師之職業與其他自由職業不同、並無國界之限制、擬請國際専門技術敎育局、綜合各國高等専門技術敎育情形、加以比較制定高等専門敎育規程與保護學位條例、</p>
<p>該會希望専門敎育、學制上分爲三個等級、第一種専門學校其目的在造成、實行工作人員、其課程校科學上訓練較前者更廣、目的在造成有管理支配等能力之人員、第三種高等専門學校招收前二種學校己畢業之學生、受更深的敎育並希望請實業家與工業學會參與専門學校董事會、俾對於専門學校之課程、得指示意見、</p>
<p>（五）學習及學徒之契約問題　該會認學習契約、當係一種保證契約、一種敎育契約、目是一種職業培養之標準、希望此契約、必係書面的、以爲學習及學徒者受職業培養之　障、</p>

<p>（一）希望飲食起居行動合於禮義廉恥</p>
<p>（二）希望於生産及國防兩大目標努力</p>
<p>江蘇敎育廳長周佛海、告全省中等學校學生書云、江蘇中敎育、號稱發逹、佛海奉命來此、得與全蘇中等學校學校學生有相規相見之機會、私衷良用欣幸、就任之始、深以學風囂張、綱紀陵夷、爲今日學校敎育之嚴重病態、思有以懲前毖後、以慰江蘇大士之望、故對於鼓動風潮、破壞紀律者、必忍痛取斷然之手段、爲嚴厲之制裁、並於痛定之餘、　切文　、反覆動諭、痛陳讀書便是救國、救國必須讀書之旨、示諸生以爲學之正軌、年來學風、己爲之不變、　省學生從善之勇、實使佛海具有無窮之厚望也、佛海愛護靑年、素不主姑息、平日所爲勞神焦思、寤寐縈懐者、厥爲諸生之學業如何進修、品格如何陶融、身體如何鍜鍊、與夫是否能認清時代之使命、擔負救國之責任、姑息之愛、於諸在無異酖毒、佛海實薄而不爲也、</p>
<p>敎育救國爲今日舉國一致之主張、亦爲確實有效至當不易之方法、顧欲收敎育救國之效、在精神方面必須使敎育有救國之精神、在物質方面、亦必使敎育有救國之凖備、换言之、即須使敎育成爲眞正之救國敎育、而一掃過去空虚之弊、佛海對此、早經洞悉、數年以來、殆無日不以全力謀此種敎育之發動與推進、然敎育之對象實爲我全體靑年學生、苟學生方面不能澈底認清當前之責任、併力以趨於救國之途徑則片面之努力、亦無補於事實、此佛海於個人致力之餘、不得不以此責望於全體學生、爰於年度開始之際、揭舉數義、爲諸生告、其各留意母忽、</p>
<p>禮義廉恥爲做人之基本條件、亦爲立國之根本精神、無禮義則上下亂、即無組織之可言、無廉恥則放僻邪移、無所不爲、即無紀律之可言、組織與紀律旣均失其存在、則國家民族未有不即於危亡、中國今日國難之嚴即重、即坐因於此、故居今日而欲言敎育救國、非以整個之敎育力量振起吾民族固有之禮義廉恥精神、其道莫由、能有此種精神方爲救國敎育、否則實足以亡國、更何救國之可言、佛海今日所望於諸生者、不僅在於學業之進修、尤在於做人基本條件之確立、在學校時如無禮義廉恥精神之修養、則做人之條件不完縱使學業有成、匪惟於國家社會無益、亦且足以長奸助亂、不知做人之害如此、諸生當亦憬然有所覺悟、而相與恪守校規、注重紀律、服從師長之指導處處痛自淬勵、務使飲食起居與一切行動、均合於義廉恥之精神、造成新生活之風氣、須知智識分子、原爲社會之領導、如全國智識分子、均能身體力行禮養廉恥之生活、則風聲所被、必能造成偉大之力量、而國家民族復興之基礎、亦母待他求矣、佛海對此、自當竭其全力爲不斷之發動與推進、諸生亦應認清做人之道理、自動努力於人格之修養、以造成此種風氣之先驅自任也、</p>
<p>救國不能徒託空言、必有充分之凖備、物質力量之凖備、尤屬必要、故今日之敎育、應以生産國産二者爲中心目標、敎育而不能有生産之效、則不免於空虚、敎育而無補於國防、亦實等於徒設、空虚無用之敎育决不足以救國、佛海對此己不惜採取任何有效之方法、期轉變敎育之方向事實具在、諒所深悉、所望於諸生者、即在於此兩大目標之努力、庶能使敎育獲救國之實效、就生産言、原有積極與消極兩方面之意義、積極方面在生産技能之培養、與勞作精神之養成、消極方面在壓抑物質慾望、减低個人之消費、此爲今日學校敎育之眞精神、而亦諸生所應深切認識自動努力以求其實現者、就國防言、諸生原不能亟切有所表現、然國防所繫、在於科學、邊疆形勢之變化、與敵我國情之審度、固有賴於史地之研求、而防禦攻守利器之發明、與夫新式戰術之運用、尤與理化及兵事等科訓練有密切之關係、以此類推、各項學科殆無一不與國防有關、諸生今日將科學基礎建築穏固、即無異爲民族全體將國防基本工具廣儲備用、深望以自動之精神、爲不斷之研究、期由試騐之步驟漸進而至於創造、至於注重體育、努力軍訓、旣足以堅强體力、打破文弱之習、一旦有事、尤足以捍衛國家、保護民族、其有助於國防者更爲切實、凡此諸端、均爲諸生今日在校所應有之努力、初非佛海之苛求也、</p>

<h3 id="c219">唐詩中的飢餓 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 澤浦</p>
<p>唐代社會，自經安祿山的叛變之後，便陷八在風雨飄搖的晦冥狀態中。政治的紛亂固屬意料中事，經濟的困竭更有非想像所能臆測的厲害。因爲在那樣（天下部國向萬城，無有一城無甲兵。）和（漢家山東二百州，千村萬木生荆杞）的情况之下，經濟期礎之崩潰自是必然的結果。生爲那時的人民曾嚐到若干的痛苦、但是想像中的事究竟不在可靠，還是實記錄中的字跡才能給我們以眞確的解釋。</p>
<p>在唐詩中，關於當時的社會狀况就保留得不少，尤其是杜甫和白居易的作品更多這類實社會現象的描寫。個人向來閱讀唐詩，對於這類作品特喜注意；其中最令我忘不了的，是當時人民所受的（飢餓）的悽慘。</p>
<p>在慾望不高，思想簡單的老百姓當中，（有吃）和（無吃）實是决定他們的生活之苦樂的全部；而且，也惟有（有吃）和（無吃）兩個問題才是决定任何民族之歷史的繁榮與否的主要因素。安史亂前的唐代社會是一個昇平歌舞的快樂社會，那時政治清明，經濟充裕，人民的生活是很安適，很舒順的；但是自從玄宗的霓裳羽衣曲給漁陽的鼙鼓驚破之後，中原便淪落在飢荒亂變的悲楚中了。杜甫有一首憶昔的詩，把當時前後兩種不同的情形說得頗爲透澈，詩云：</p>
<p>（憶昔開元全盛日，小邑猶藏躉家室，稻米流脂粟米白，公私倉廪俱豐實。九州道路無狼虎，遠行不勞吉日出。亦紈魯縞車班班，男耕女桑不相失，宫中聖人奏雲門，天下朋友皆膠漆。百餘年來未災變，叔孫禮樂蕭何律。豈聞一絹值萬錢？有田種榖今流血丨洛陽宫殿燒焚盡，宗廟新除狐兎穴。傷心不忍問耆舊，復恐初從亂離說！······）</p>
<p>老杜是親身經歷過太平和變亂兩時代的人，所記自屬實情。由此我們可以看出當時的情形一變就是完全相反的。</p>
<p>安史亂前旣然是個太平世，所以民生自是可有快樂，這在前期的唐詩中也有極明顯的痕跡可見，李白·岑參·高適·王維諸人的集子中所以充滿了（酒内）味的緣胡，就是因爲他們所處的環境安適所致；但是在後期的唐詩中，却是充滿了飢餓寒凍等等刺目的字眼了。看：</p>
<p>（庶往共饑渴，······幼子餓己卒！）（赴奉先縣詠懷）</p>
<p>（秋至轉飢寒。）（因崔五侍御高彭州）</p>
<p>（飢有易子食。）（别唐十五誡）</p>
<p>（恒飢稚子色凄凉！）（狂夫）</p>
<p>（此日飢寒趨路旁。）（莫相疑行）</p>
<p>（飢寒迫向隅。）（舟中出江陵南浦）</p>
<p>（無食無兒一婦人。）（又呈吳郎）</p>
<p>（痴女飢咬我。）（彭衙行）</p>
<p>（終日忍飢西復東。）（白鳬行）</p>
<p>（忍飢浮雲巘。）（八哀詩）</p>
<p>（饑拾楢橡溪。）（八哀詩）</p>
<p>（饑寒永相望。）（遺興之一）</p>
<p>（饑寒日啾啾。）（鳳凰臺）</p>
<p>以上是杜甫的。</p>
<p>（飢年無遺粟，······苦飢形貌傷。）（感懷）</p>
<p>（四爲飢雪吟。）（飢雪吟）</p>
<p>（飢者重一食。）（秋懷之十一）</p>
<p>（晚飢心將崩！）（秋懷之十七</p>
<p>（飢食無名蔬。）（清安寄居）</p>
<p>（饑童饑馬掃花喂。）（濟源寒食之三）</p>
<p>（餓死抱空山。）（弔廬殷）</p>
<p>以上是孟東野的。</p>
<p>（閭井多死饑。）（歸彭城）</p>
<p>（饑啼但啾啾。）（洞庭阻風贈張十一曙）</p>
<p>以上是韓昌黎的。</p>
<p>（拾此充饑腸。）（觀刈麥）</p>
<p>（救此苦飢腸。）（采地黄者）</p>
<p>（終歲守窮餓，）（丘中有一土）</p>
<p>（飢來何所爲？）（續古詩之三）</p>
<p>（天熱日長飢欲死！）（捕蝗）</p>
<p>（朝上餐飢渴費杯盤）。（縛戎人）</p>
<p>以上是白居易的，此外如元結的（朝餐是草根，暮食仍樹皮）。（春陵行）也無非是寫飢餓的悽慘呢！</p>
<p>生爲亂世的老百姓，受飢受寒原來不算是什麽奇事。八世紀中葉以後的中國人民所受的苦是這樣，往後亂世所受的苦也是這樣。當我讀到了杜甫的（飢有易子食）一句的時候，我眞忍不住要聯想到往年甘陜各省饑荒時人家易子而食的事情呢！至於吃花，吃草根，吃樹皮，那更是古今所常見常聞的，惟有吃石粉，吃沙，吃土則爲往古所未有！</p>
<p>俗語說：（願爲太平狗，勿作亂世民），這句話說的實在是。太平時代的狗比動亂時代的人確是快活得多。爲的太平時代的狗旣有物可吃，又有地方可玩，而動亂時代中的老百姓却非但要受飢受寒，就是行動也不自由啦！</p>

<p>他眼不觸及天上烏鴉與老鷹齋飛，只把目光從架在鼻尖尖上之古老的白銅寬邊眼鏡裏透過，注視着執在手中的一卷書，逐行閱讀。我不能知道那是一卷什麽國焠名著，想來是施公案或是七俠五義吧。他用心之専，足以使我深深地欽佩，這種努力的精神，足使中國文化迎頭趕上世界之潮流。再他那安詳閒適的態度，十足地流露出咱們雍雍大國五千年來的古風。你看他從容不迫地一面閱書，一而執着繩鞭，拍的一聲，響亮而無力地打着地面，於是驢子又振起那己萎靡下來的精神，又較速地前進。於是又一陣的胡塵飛起，揚起，像澎湃的怒濤。</p>

<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>我的朋友告訴我一件關於放逐的故事，覺得值得寫下來丨丨丨</p>
<p>（給放逐到利辜荒島去了後，我和那年靑的，黑臉蛋的朋友丨丨丨丨蘇馬冷有如生活在兩個絶然不同的世界里似的，倒現在都是不相聞問的了。</p>
<p>（但是，你知道：我是不能忘記他的。</p>
<p>（一九三○年的冬天，我失業在上海，異常悲慘地生活了一些時候，得到荷屬××一家報館的聘請便立即往那里去住下來，開始了我的記者生活。做事的第一天，就有人警告我：這裏是帝國主義的殖民地，言論是很受到拑制，不能自由的。對於帝國主義者的面目，我早己相當的明晰的；然而直接受到威迫還是在這廟住了兩個多月以後的一天，因了一篇文字而被關在牢裏了。</p>
<p>（一個月的牢獄生涯眞不容易過去呵！在這裏湊巧地碰到了蘇馬冷。丨丨丨他那時是一家馬來文報館的總編輯，同樣因文字召了禍的。如果没有他，單就對付獄卒來說，也應該是够煩死我的罷。因我那時節馬來土話是一句也說不來的。幸而蘇馬冷能够代了我許多勞；而且，他的英語說和比我更其流利，他的態度又那麽謙和，於是我們不上兩天就變成好的朋友了。</p>
<p>（他有一次這樣告訴我：</p>
<p>（丨丨我這次是第二次下獄了。</p>
<p>（丨丨丨哦······多久呢？</p>
<p>（我問着。把半寸長的香烟頭扔了，蘇馬冷伸出兩隻微微有點粗黑的指頭在我的面前苦笑着。我又問他進多少的日子，他回答道：</p>
<p>（丨快滿了，還差兩個多月的光景。</p>
<p>（自然，我是很快地離開了牢獄，獨自回轉到報館裏去。等到蘇馬冷也出來的時候，上海的抗日戰爭己經一天比一天的緊張，影響到南洋方面也很敎統治的人顫抖起來！我們的言論不自由，我們的電訊都嚴密地受了檢查！而蘇馬冷那家報紙郤非常勇敢地，把日本帝國主義的兇殘面目揭發出來！他見到我的時候，老是喊：</p>
<p>（丨丨丨怒吼罷，中國！</p>
<p>（我受着他的熱誠感動，常常自愧着身爲中國人的懦怯。他高興起來還坦白的對我說：</p>
<p>（丨丨丨朋友，我可以告訴你，我是有着重大的使命在身上的。怕什麽！年靑人不應當勇敢些麽？聽見你們的英勇的抗戰，我是會更興奮的。你也看得見我們的被壓迫的情形罷？你也是站在我們一邊的罷？我們應當携手的啊！</p>
<p>（他說得那麽懇切那麽有力。作爲解放弱小的，被壓迫的人們的戰士，蘇馬冷是值得欽佩的。······</p>
<p>（然而，不久之後聞說他又被捕了。丨丨這是第三回了，情形更加嚴重；報紙祇輕描淡寫地記載着。我幾次往政治部（蘇馬冷是被禁在那里的。）去會他都没有被允許，帶着失望的，憤慨的情緒回來，我咬緊了牙根；可是我能做什麽呢？</p>
<p>（一個月以後，蘇馬冷不給我再見一面，就給解到了海關碼頭，决定放逐支遼遠的，蠻荒的利辜孤島去了。</p>
<p>（没多久我辭了職，我一點也不留戀地離開了××，我忘不掉放逐到孤島去了的年靑鬥士。···）</p>
<p>我是相信縱使是在殖民地，戰艦，鐵甲車，飛機，炸彈强壓之下也有清醒的人在活躍的。我是同情那些可憐的，被榨取者的。我是十餘來眼看着統治者如何用軟和硬的手段施於千萬人的身上的。如今我的朋友的故事，我是寫下來了，丨丨這是還没有完結的故事，蘇馬冷的來日方長，誰敢說他被放逐到荒島去。就完了呢？</p>

<p>（這也是對的。）阿召却有點同情冬生瘸手。（說是鄕下要抽壯丁，上海就不會了。那也未必。大來哥，在船上，做水手。那一年不是因爲要裝兵，把船捉了去，一定要大來哥，他們開到火地去。大來哥給一個兵老爺，一脚踼在卵袋裏損了神。三天後，不是死了嗎？這且不要說，前年，上海大打仗。阿生在東洋紗廠做，停了工，當什麽義勇軍，死在什麽賊北嗎？一打仗的時候，不去當兵，也要死；去當兵，也要死。一樣要死，還不如去學學看，練一點槍法來，學一點武藝來，好歹也得幹一下子哪。）</p>
<p>木仁老閉了閉眼，想了一想，覺得阿召底話有點對。時勢亂了，鄕下人也不命太平的。咸豐年庚，老年單說，這裏也鬧過長毛。一到後來，宣統還没登爪，光緒三十三年，自己還親眼看見過平洋黨王錫同，打敎堂，殺吃敎飯的。如其西洋直脚鬼，東洋矮子打進來，說不定，還要用自己大瘋脚當做檀樹砲呢。</p>

<p>這去小西天不遠就是一家飯館。他們還是適用着那老法，進了店門，便是廚房，穿過這個廚房，才到飯座上來。在一所很大的天棚底下擺了十來副座頭，却也乾净。二人坐下，李士廉道：我不大吃油膩的東西，找點清淡的吃吃罷。賈多才笑道；我先聲明，這裏吃菜，魚鴨兩樣休提，只有鴨和猪肉，十分清淡的，大槪還是没有。李士廉搔搔頭髮道：那麽，你包辦點菜罷，我不過問了。賈多才倒也不客氣，自把菜單子開了。店伙送上菜壺茶标來，賈多才向杯子裏斟着茶，笑道：喝到這茶，就讓人不想在西北謀生了。李士廉接過茶杯，問道：那爲什麽？說着，端起不子呷了一口嘗嘗，嘴唇皮搭着響了幾下，因道：這水不好嗎？我嘗不出什麽味道來。說着，又端起來呷了一口。賈多才道：這水是最好的水了，這裏並滑有什麽異味，你不用嘗。你那裏知這？西安城裏共有十二萬人，都喝西門裏面一口井的水，用小桶子盛着，用小車子推着分頭去送給用户喝。路近也罷了，路遠呢，每桶要兩三毛錢。李士廉道：難道全城就只這一口井嗎？賈多才道：井雖然有，但是打出來的水，都是泥湯，不但不能喝，連洗衣服，都要澄清了才能用。我們南方人出門就是水，到了這把水當寳貝用的西北來，這可就老大的感到痛苦。你是止到西安，還不知道這無水的痛苦，假如像我一樣，往西走個幾百里，這就不想到西北來换什麽口胃了。李士廉道：我倒要問你，你爲什麽往西走呢？賈多才笑道：這就是到民間去了。說着這話時，店伙送上酒壺杯筷，和一大盤冷葷來。（二六）</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>不是我頭腦冬烘，派現代的人們不是，實在眼前的景色，竟和古代所詋的話巧合，不能不舉出來給大衆一噱，須知道我只是考古，並不是掉文。</p>
<p>論語上說的（微管仲吾其被髮左袵矣！）被髮左袵當時是夷狄的模樣，誰知隔了二千多年，被稱爲摩登的典型。試瞧，現代的女子，不是秀髮紛披，都遮被到衣領以下麽？照朱子的注釋，那個（被）字，應當讀作（披），更和現代剪髮的光景相合了。至於左袵，似乎還没有做到，但是照王壬秋的日記說，清朝的外套和馬褂，就是左袵。他說：</p>
<p>（左袵當是對襟衣，當中開襟，不必紐扣，便可加帶。夷狄上馬便速，襲衣手時，或申而不屈，亦可加結加襲，皆左袵。狄亦左袵，今西北馬褂對襟中，有小袵在右襟掩左，是共製也。</p>
<p>這個說數，比朱子的注釋來得透澈，那麽中華民國的常禮服，用馬褂，己經是用夷變夏了，穿西裝的，可的把這一點作護身符。</p>
<p>不過孔老夫子所指的被髮左袵，一定是夷狄的男性，怎的現在把這兩椿事情分配於男女兩性了呢。</p>
<p>記得在國民革命軍北伐的當兒，各地有一種謠傳，說要（打倒馬褂，）竟有好多時不見馬褂大交際塲中活動，可是現在舉行大典禮時，又見長袍短褂的在躋蹌了。那天曲阜祭孔，女的没有一個不是被髮，男的也一律左袝袵，（與祭者）不知道孔老夫子見了，要不要喟然而歎？</p>
<p>新生活運動禁止女子燙髮，却不禁止被髮，我以爲長得像戲台　上的武松一般，非但不美，並且不潔，中山裝雖也是從西裝蛻化而來，却不是左袵，值得提倡。那個風紀扣，　也不是道地的國産，因爲以前都是圓領，或斜襟的。所以這篇帳，只好擱起不談了。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>現在讓我把這到站接駕的，四十位官員的底細叙一叙：第一位是總督大人，就是袁世凱，他有權可以統轄直隷全省和山東，河南各　的軍隊，因爲他掌握着這樣强厚的實力，所以無論在名義上，或實際上，他總是站在一個領袖的地位上。以下是撫台，専司一省的民政；再次是藩台，（布政使）就是掌理全省財政的人：還有臬台（按察使）他的任務是専司審理一省以内的刑訴事件。這四位雖然很明顯地被指定着分掌軍，民，政法，法四種不同的政務，但彼此間的權責，却並没有怎樣清楚的界限劃定，往往可以互相干涉或互相推諉。不邊這些也管不得他們了！總之，在這四十位官員中，他們四位，都好算是最高級的長官了！除掉他們而外，再輪下去，就得讓道台稱尊了。那時候的一個省分，每劃分爲幾道，一道有一個主持的長官，便是所謂道台。論他們的官級和地位，都和如今各特别市的制長差不多，但嚴格的講起來，則又完全不同；因爲如今的市長往往要直接和人民接觸，那時候的道台，却絶對的不屑顧問民事，他們認爲人民是最卑賤的東西，要如一個做大官的人再去直接和民衆接觸，便是一椿秀丢臉的事情，因此把管理民衆的責任，一起都卸在隷屬於他們的州縣官的身上，卽使有特别勤於工作的，也祇揀幾件比較重要些的事情問問而己。</p>
<p>在直隷一省之内，另外還有七個官級和道台相等的官員，他們的人數雖然也有七人之多，但他們的任務却是十二分的簡單，一般只是管理鼓鑄銀幣的一件小事，統稱爲造幣廠總辦。而且這並不是說是爲他們對於鼓鑄銀幣有什麽特殊的研究或經騐，所以請他們來指導或監督的，祇是因爲他們要做官，他們的父兄或親戚，便敎他們隨便來客串一齣了。</p>
<p>這些官員中還有二個更特别的，一個唤做僧綱司，一個唤做道紀司，他們的地位，也和這台相等；可是他們的任務，却和外國的主敎差不多，他們所管的只是寺院和僧道。（一三六）</p>

<p>現在上海地方，騙子眞多，騙術也愈出愈奇。倘是你稍不經意，便要上他們的當。就是你足不出户，也會有人來光顧。想個法兒，撈取你衣袋中的金錢。尤其是，貼有（召租）的居户。是他們行騙的目標，要分外留意纔好。下面所記，便是鄰居×姓家被騙的事實！</p>
<p>×姓家近因家中有餘屋出租，便在門首貼了一張（召租）。前日清晨，有衣服整潔之甲之二男子，進去看屋。倒看得很爲合意，每月房租若干，也講定了。照例要先付定洋三元，甲便取出××銀行十元鈔票請找。×姓主人看了又看，說是好的，就找他大洋七元。二人正待要走，甲還指點着說：露台旁邊要安排個木竃，扶梯旁邊要放一雙榻。這一來，二房東可就不答應了。和二人爭論了半响，終至於决裂，仍退還那張鈔票，甲執在手中，正要還那七元。乙忽從旁勸解說：這房屋我們很是合意，棄之可惜。不如我們遷就此，那種東西，再另行設法就是了。這時二房東正有些不捨，見他們軟化了，便說很好。於是甲手中的那張鈔票，仍交了出來。並說明這宅的日子，二人便翩然而去。主人再看那鈔票，發覺己變成假票。原來在一轉移間，眞的己被掉包。念忙差人追出，二人己鴻飛冥冥，不知去向。</p>
<p>二房東娘娘跑了出來，對那張召租恨恨地說：貼了召租，不料召了兩個騙子來，眞正氣數。說罷，把那張召租，撕得片片作蝴蝶飛。</p>

<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>讀二十三年九月十六日申報所載（日人侵略北滿新興企業會社之調查）一節，期第一種，即爲製粉事業之第一二廠，晝夜工作，日産三千二百袋之多，猶以爲未足，復於本年六月，組合第三廠於綏化，七月二十四，即己開始營業，日産一千五百袋之粉，可謂　興之至，但其資本，不過二百萬元，旣有三井三菱系之商家爲投資中心，並有日本原設製粉會社之股份，及僞中央銀行之資金：當然可以咄嗟立辦，不足奇也。製粉事業，本如我國之麵粉廠一般，吸收農産品以資大量生産，本足以使人盡其力，地盡其利，吾國素重農工，製紛廠亦己設有不少，但其所需原料，國産者每嫌量少價昻，反以外來者廉，因取便利，合此就彼，而農作物，愈形消極，此中一大　結，即在關稅失其控制之方，假使外來米麥，亦如酒精一般，徴收稅率，竟與土燒賣價相等，當然能免火酒攙水以免土燒之弊，而在國内亦即有自造酒精之可能，蓋酒精原料，亦即農産品也。日人於製粉之外，又以一百六十七萬元之資本，設酒精廠於哈爾濱，其目的在用富産之高粱並言正在研究其他，則米酒麥酒以及番著六榖甘蔗等等，必將應有盡有，此即與我所擬（四民救濟公司）之計劃一般。蓋欲使我國家富强，必當首重於農，務令力田所入，能免飢寒，而無凍餒，則不致棄其田疇，趨向都市，以致廣田自荒！惟其物價參落之際，終歳勤劬，而竟不能飽暖，甚且水旱災荒，相乘而至，則棄耒耜而走險，固亦事勢之所迫蠶絲旣不值錢，伐桑改種，亦且成風，正如漏舟在大風浪中，呼天號泣，沈滅之禍，只在眉睫間矣。就我之見，惟有一法，可救危亡，即由船主下令，速合羣力，以塞其漏，使外水不能大量灌入，更令操舟者，拼命用力以加速率，期達彼岸，在此抵塞漏孔之際，任何犧牲，胥所不惜，與其同舟共命，俱占滅頂，母寗犧牲一切，與死神相搏，蓋此舟不過是漏，尚未到於全體破裂，若不倉皇失措，棄其帆槳而爲楚因之泣，固猶可有補救之方也。所謂帆槳，即猶耒耜今棄耒耜而謀機械，無異在漏舟之中，希圖攺爲汽船以增速率，即使咄嗟之間，眞有攺成汽船之可能，則操帆槳者亦即可以立時失業，反爲袖手旁觀，然而漏孔不塞，己不特其成功，同歸於盡，可斷言也。故吾以爲救亡之策，惟有迅速抵塞漏巵，以關稅爲壁壘，正和黄河治水一般，一方以堅築堤防，免爲冲决，一方即當盡力乎溝洫，通甚己塞，恢復其己廢者，大都有往績之遺留，但使二人爲耦，一耦之伐，廣尺深尺，則有數千萬人，同時盡力乎溝洫，爲入川注海之圖，其速率當如行軍一般，四路進兵，同趨一的，則因勢而利導，又何致有此旱彼潦之絶端相反之景狀？禹平水土而後，河患不絶於中國，正以禹死之後，無人再繼其功，専享現成，不知更進，而且塡河爲地，翻以前人爲愚者，正不獨一鯀耳。猶之后稷敎民稼穡而後，人人皆吃現成之飯，四民之中，士居其首，不耕而食，不布而衣，人人皆欲爲士，子孫不願世守其業，盡趨向於不勞而獲之途，有一頃田，少一人耕，即其産量减少而消費者增多，求過於供，物價當然高漲，不耕不織之徒，不能不食不衣，則量出爲入，勢必求其生活之主，於是販賣洋貨，以收漁人之利，而使外人與我國人爲鷸蚌之爭，是即孟子所謂賤丈夫也。</p>

<p>— 澤承</p>
<p>丨丨所謂（生活）（Ｌive）是世上稀有的事；一般人是生存着的，然而祇是這樣地生存着便了麽？</p>
<p>英國十九世紀文學家　爾特（ＯscarWilde）把這（生存）與（生活）的區别，解釋得非常清楚。他說；（一股人是活着的，餓死的事情究竟少有；然而祇是這樣平凡的活着，和鳥獸的活法没有什麽不同，没有自覺得所謂（活）這事情的意　而享受（活）這事情的喜悅，不能說是正儅的（生活）。）</p>
<p>（我們究竟爲什麽要生長到這世界上來？）能够淺顯地解答這問題的人究竟還是少數中的最少數吧。大多數的人從母胎裏落下來就踏入了夢境；而永永地夢着，甚而至於會帶着昏沉的夢幻而跨入深深的墓穴。</p>
<p>在苦悶的時代下的靑年，封建殘餘勢力步步地向他們突聲；生的鞭子一下下地向他們背上狠抽；在金錢之惡魔灰黯狰獰的翅膀的展張下，他們會被逼迫着冒昧地踏出了生活的軌道，而攢入生存的圈套。</p>
<p>多可怕的現象呵！</p>
<p>我們，是靑年，假使是敏覺的，假使是銳感的，當然不會誤入銷沉了你的意氣後落了你的靈魂的陷阱。不過，當我們踏上了人生之大道，我們仍須仔細地觀察一下，一條較爲平坦而趨向黑暗的是生存的歧路，一條崎嶇而曙着一綫光明的是生活之大道。</p>
<p>我希望，我們不是一樣存在在世界上的物件。也不要昧着良心出賣了自己的靈魂。</p>
<p>我希望，我們能在人生道上勇毅地堅靱地追隨着那在泛濫的準備冲毁一切的歷史底巨潮，打出了一條生活的血路，做一個不平凡的人。</p>

<p>— 莎菲</p>
<p>坐上火車，我後悔似乎不應該有此一行了。從前有過一個時候，可以說過着火車生活，但是現在一見了車站就覺得頭痛，原因那是自己都說不出來了，或在是我現在没有坐火車的必要了。</p>
<p>車在規定的時間遲開二十分鐘，我們可以不必問理由，據說在北道上，三天五天的脫車，旅客並不覺得是奇事。然而這些每天在火車上的時候似乎没有覺得，現在這二十分的時間中，我幾次想跨下車來，等到他打鐵板的時候，車中的旅客都顯示了不安的現象。</p>
<p>日子在中秋上一天，有許多同伴舉了大包小件歸家的，我獨自暗笑，一星期之前就想動身的，却凑到了這個天上人間的團圓佳節。於是想起我的家，在白雲深處的家呵！</p>
<p>離别故鄕，獨自個兒漂流在外面，計算起來，己是整整八個年頭了。當秋季大减價的市招在淒風苦雨中飄揚的時候，我意識支我的流浪生活增加了一年，就是我離别故鄕是×週紀念了。老母，妻子，我的初生的孩子，現在應該是九歳了，他們一定是日夜盼望着找歸去。本年前曾接到故鄕的來信，說如其我够了戰程的旅費，就歸家一次罷！接着這封信，我就整整哭了一夜天，我似乎見我老母拐了木杖倚望在門前她的銀絲般的白髮，被南國的風吹拂着，使人想起一種不調和的感覺；妻子呢，孩子呢，或者就是歸去，也不會認識是他們的丈夫和爸爸了！</p>
<p>遙遠的，遙遠的，在南國之濱的家可！</p>
<p>火車狂嘯着在每個碼頭停住，牠帶了許多遊子投到他們慈母憻懷中；妻子的懷中。我想在這車廂發見一個和我一般有家歸不得的伴侣，我們放聲大哭來紀念交們的中秋。</p>
<p>但是滿車廂是嘻笑的臉，他們是歸家去的啊，是那樣甜蜜的一個家，有老母，有妻子，有孩子。反問我自己爲什麽不歸去呢？没有單程的旅費嗎？我没有回答，因爲回答甚至不能滿意我自己，丨就是我不能回到那個家去啊。</p>
<p>（舉首望明月，低頭思故鄉）誰個詩人做出這樣的詩句來？我無意間憶起這兩句詩，就咒駡那詩的作者了，怒意地把視綫從事實中收回來接到車廂的角落裏，瞧見一個孩子捧着大月餅要他父親分開來吃，說起月餅，在故鄕是最最著名的，現在南京路上己是廣式月餅大减價的時候了，上海人對於吃似乎是特别留意，他們喜歡吃各的的名産，甚實吃過我們故鄉的月餅，上海的這些（廣式一己不是眞眞道地的了，月餅在故鄕是一種普通的食品，然而在這大都市中偏偏用來點綴良辰佳節的。中秋吃月餅有什麽理由呢，轉圞是否可以塡補我心的缺陷？</p>
<p>火車經過許多碼頭，車廂中旅客陸續稀少，我希望到達終點的時候，僅僅我一個人，於是我提直懈的行箱，似乎歸鄕的神情似的跨下火車，踏上車站，誰能知道我的家是在遙遠的南國之濱呢？</p>

<p>丨丨司的克的女人呵！一瞧見街上每個男人的胳膊那兒鈎着女人的臂磅，同掛着司的克的姿態度全没兩樣，就不禁在心裏邊呌了起來。</p>
<p>去到什麽地方，從來没看過有一個女人不給男人掛在胳膊上，有如生了根的緊緊纒住，像蘿蔦藤纒住牆頭似的，稍一離開，自己便站不穏而側了下去。因此鎭日價離不了男人的胳膊，老需要讓男人鈎在胳膊上，離開了的時候，就會跼蹐着，感到寂寞，感到被主人遺棄的司的克一樣的寂寞，無端孤獨着了。</p>
<p>女人的司的克啊！在電影院上，在舞塲上，女人更是司的克化了的，更是少不了有個男人挽着臂膀，做保障，於是便嘻嘻地笑着，彷彿在說，是有了衛護者的主人了。</p>
<p>司的克是没有生命的，女人郤是有生命的而又有司的克感掛着没有生命的司的克，跟掛着有生命的司的克感的女人，自然比較能發生實感，但所給掛者的作用，同樣是司的克的作用。</p>
<p>然而流浪的孤獨者則偏愛没實感的司的克，有時看比有生命的司的克感的女人更親暱。這因爲是輕快，帶着它上街。一點不累墮，而女人是有司的克所没有的累墮的。並且司的克感的女人是活的，會賭氣，也會饞嘴，上午要吃德國大菜，下午要買高價的化妝品，一個不對勁，便會得掛到别個的胳膊上的。所以掛着司的克感的女人是有物質昇沉的時間性，倒不如掛着眞司的克的閑適，毫無危險，不必担心到它的反抗。</p>

<p>— 丁星</p>
<p>這裏是没有山的；山那裏去了啊？</p>
<p>（山被淹没在銀白的浪花裏了，洶洶的萬頃波濤把牠蕩送到海那邊去了）。</p>
<p>丨丨伴着我們初戀的山，這裏是没有的！</p>
<p>我把這悲傷的消息，告訴了在海那邊的冰；於是是她給我安慰說：</p>
<p>丨丨没有山也好，這可以减少些你苦憶的挑動吧？</p>
<p>然而，山的形骸雖然不再在這都市裏給我找到；而牠留在我孤寂心頭的憶念並不曾模糊。每當夕陽西沈四野蒼茫的暮際，獨個兒徘徊於草地上。我便痛苦地做着白天的夢：我夢到綠的山，和我們綠的初戀。</p>
<p>不過是這年頭的事情，一個初春下午，小邱第一次印上了我們的足跡。那時候，山纔覆上一層淺綠，淡淡地，同冰身上穿着的衣服一樣顔色，互映着。於是，這綠呵，就這樣做了我們初戀的象徴。</p>
<p>可是，幾個月祇那麽暫短地過去了，一切也跟着消逝！山還没有開始褪去牠的綠；而我們聚合的歡娱便换了遠别的離愁！而她呢？而今連山給我們最後一次的依戀，也成了幻的慘痛回憶了：</p>
<p>那是個中夏傍晚，我們像往常一樣坐在那小邱頂頭；四周靑草的濃味冷冷地鑽進鼻孔，悵惘的情緖，蟲似的，在心坎頭爬上，爬下。</p>
<p>冰握了我伸過了給她的手，翹首仰望着幾朶淺紅的浮霞，沈沈地，慢慢地說：</p>
<p>丨丨去吧，星！爲着未來。</p>
<p>我從側面凝視她朝空的臉，有些流體在她眼珠面上轉動，我感到牙關一陣酸硬，便也仰起頭，默默地，望着灰色的天。</p>
<p>晚潮的風從對面海灣吹來，心同風那麽虚渺，那麽虚渺啊！</p>
<p>天漸漸黯了下來：浮霞的淺紅轉成灰暗色。</p>
<p>丨丨回去啦，天昂晚了。</p>
<p>我搖了搖冰凝直的身體，好無言地站了起來。從小邱項頭，渡着遲緩的脚步，沿着那條曾經印下千百個我們足跡的小路，回到山下時。冰回頭望了那突在蒼茫氛圍中的小邱，頽然伏有我肩上，抑不住鬱着的辛酸，飲泣着說：</p>
<p>丨丨這以後的小邱？······</p>
<p>如今，這裏是没有山的：山那裏去了啊？</p>
<p>（萬頃洶洶的波濤把山蕩送到海那邊去了。）</p>
<h3 id="c236">秋心 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 超人</p>
<p>幾天霏霏的雨，秋在樹梢上滑過了。</p>
<p>九月的風帶來秋天的凉爽氣味，白雲在淡藍的高空閒蕩，蟬凄怨地唱出牠没有落的葬曲，凉意，開始佈滿了人間，桐葉一片片飄着，火熖般的夏溶過了。</p>
<p>熟了的葡萄架上散射的一種迷醉，温暖地瀰漫在空氣裏，支配了人的心靈：但是萎悴的苦蓮，池邊將枯黄的草，下产織着一層薄薄的新愁。</p>
<p>秋又來了，流浪者的心啊！</p>
<p>在都市，秋也披上她意識的輕紗。</p>
<p>太太們試着新做成的時裝，絲襪舗子也許也增進了一些營業；冷飲品雖間或還有人嘗試，温煖的百合湯終究受到時效的歡迎；秋陽柔和地染責了安放盆花的平台，男人想起那效外的楓葉，奴隷在措拂主子新買的獲槍。</p>
<p>秋月湧出晶亮的素色，潟在街頭人行道旁的樹梢，漏下疏淡的碎影，兩旁的屋子，一家家都把百葉窗關上，有的露出絲絲的燈光，燈光中的情侣偎得格外緊了。</p>
<p>街頭剩下的祇是沈寂和凄凉，風吹破黑黝黝的夜幕，捲着枯葉和塵土飛舞，風露中點綴了幾多無家可歸的流浪者。</p>
<p>秋的意識在紳士們呢帽上旋躍，流浪者想起保管在高利貸舗子裏的衣服。</p>
<p>秋又來了，流浪者的心啊！</p>
<p>大地的邊綠轟着機械的吼聲，在那兒没有日夜，没有健康，健康給輪子和皮帶捲跑，窒息的空氣在散髮上不斷地落下灰塵，他們不知道有什麽秋天，鋼鐵和煤烟代替整個的人生，他們一個個被地獄生活深刻下額皺。</p>
<p>好多年没有黄熟的田野，遍地都呈着荒凉。人禍的天災一次次掃蕩，戰爭更番地蹂躪，正當的田賦，有的己徴到幾十年後了，偉大的洋勢力，間接的深深侵略着，農人最後是一無所有了，他們所剩唯一財産的身子也在天天减輕。秋天對於這饑寒的一羣失去她抒情功能，秋風秋雨帶給他們一個死亡，他們是在等待死，有的走着各别的路。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>九月十八日登載周　峙先生的（到西北去）的幾個先决問題。第一（你怎樣去），第二（去了怎樣）。在我覺得這二個問題似乎並不是先决題，先决問題到爲什麽會産生（到西北去）的口號。因爲農村破産，都市各業衰落，造成了整千整萬的失業羣衆。但是農村會無故破産碼？都市會無故衰落嗎？不，這完全是由於帝國主義經濟的侵略，國内政治的混亂，以及其他天災人禍所賜予的；一般靑年在這樣的情形之下，以爲没有出路了，祇有到邊疆去，另找出路，所以就産生了（到西北去）的口號。但我覺得靑年想到那邊找出路，不但難上加難，並且根本是錯誤的。譬如你能够到了那邊，你能保證西北農村不破産嗎？都市各業不衰落嗎？這是誰也不能加以保證的。因爲在這列强經濟侵略瓜分中國的趨勢下，中國的經濟命脈完全掌握在他們的手中，旣然中國内地的都市和農村，己被他們造成如此局面，那末邊疆不也是和内地一樣，也要破産和衰落嗎？</p>
<p>我認爲在現在這樣的環境下，要到西北去，好像自己屋裏火燒，逃到隔壁去，旣不想救熄它，也不想再到自己家裏去拿東西北來，祇向隔吢跑，而没有想到假使火没有熄，慢慢的也會延燒過來的。所以靑年想到西北去求生，可說是畏難苟安，逃避了他們應負的責任。我倔靑年應該負起責任來，設法消滅這可怕能够延蔓的火焰：怎樣使農村不破産？怎樣使各業不衰，失業减少？這纔是我們的先决條件。然後你纔可再考慮周先生所說的（你怎樣去），和（去了怎樣）的條件，設法到西北去。</p>
<p>李俊　　九月廿一日</p>
<p>編者按：自刋載了周巍峙君的一篇（到西北去的先决問題）的文章後，就接到幾位讀者者來信商榷，這可表現各人對於研究現實問題的熱心。編者决定把這些信陸續的發表出來，以供大衆的探討。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>明骨世界？什麽呌明骨世界呢？這是大家不懂得的。不過光復了，就是革過命，革過命就要剪辮子，六公公却很能理解，於是他不由的摸了一下自己的小白辮子，少不了很擔民的說：</p>
<p>（三先生，聽說如今明骨世界，一定要剪辮子的是嗎？）</p>
<p>（那當然囉，你看我就没有了辮子。文明文都是没有辮子的。）</p>
<p>三先生到底是進過洋學堂的，所以他是聞名人了，所以他要剪辮子了。可是大先生也很聞名呀，誰不知道我們大田胃一個旭齋先生呢？他爲什麽還留着辮子呢？不過也許因爲他還没有革過命吧？六公公便私自恃着：自己不是聞名人，當然總還可以留着這一根白辮子帶下棺材去。於是他很高興，他大聲的說：</p>
<p>（那末我們大家是不要緊的，我們不是聞名人呀！）</p>
<p>一聽着六公公如此說，大家都覺得很有道理，不免心裏輕鬆了許多。祇有毛老大却不是這樣想。他以爲自己雖然並没有聞過名，可是剪了辮子到也很好，至少早晨磨豆腐的時候，總不致於連頭髮都給汗水浸濕了，不過他到底還不想剪掉，他說：</p>
<p>（剪掉辮子，誰不歡喜，不過現在還不知道到底是那一個的江山。假使現在我們剪掉了，等到明骨世界還變不成功，又變成宣統皇帝的天下，那才不得了哩，剪了辮子就是殺了頭呀。）</p>
<p>說到這裏，覺得老婆在自己的背上觸了一下，於是他立刻想到自己說錯了话話；三先生不是剪了辮了的麽？所以他很快的說回頭：</p>
<p>（不過三先生當然知我們不同，你是進過洋學堂的，你見過的世面比我們多，你做和事當然不會錯的······）</p>
<p>（當然囉，）洋鬼子開始話了：（你們一年到頭住在鄕下，自然不會知道外面的事。這一次革命黨起事，你們得知道是滅滿清，變民國。民國就是不要皇帝，變爲人民的國家。從前是専制國，現在是民主國，所以呌做民國。民國就要剪辮子。至於說現在還不能斷定是那一邊的天下，那末滿清亡是亡定了的。現在那一省，不在響應革命黨？滿清就清靠一個袁世凱，可是袁世凱就主張和革命黨議和。所以你看滿清還有什麽辦法？）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Italian Envoy to China Promoted <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Italian Relations Grow More Cordial</p>
<p>London is Extremely Interested</p>
<p>Rome: The Foreign Ministry today formally announced that the Italian legation in China will be immediately upgraded to an embassy. (26th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government has recently decided to promote the Italian diplomatic representative to China from envoy to ambassador. This move signifies Italy's recognition of China as a major power, and reflects increased importance placed on Sino-Italian political, economic, and cultural relations. The upgrading of the embassy is intended to demonstrate solemnity. The Fascist Party has exerted great efforts to enhance relations between Rome and the Far East. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini once stated that it is the responsibility of Italian intellectuals to bridge European and Asian cultures. Last December, Rome hosted a conference for Asian students, which Mussolini personally attended, delivering a speech and offering encouragement to the Asian students. Simultaneously, the Sino-Italian Institute was established, a fact widely remembered. Furthermore, Chinese civilian and military delegations have continuously visited Italy for study. In particular, the visit of Chinese Army University President Yang Jie in May of this year was highly regarded by Italy. Italy pays special attention to selling aircraft in China. Last month, Mao Bangchu, the principal of the Central Aviation School, led an aviation inspection delegation to Rome. Viewing it from this angle, the decision to upgrade the Italian envoy to China is indeed a demonstration of the sincerity of its policy towards the East. Within the broader foreign policy of the Fascist Party, it may bear a special mission, which remains to be seen. (26th Havas News)</p>
<p>Rome: According to Reuters from London, the upgrading of the Italian legation in Beiping is regarded by diplomatic observers as a matter of great interest. This is because, currently, only Soviet Russia has an ambassador in China. Other countries have historically held the view that the timing for upgrading their legations is not yet ripe. London has not yet offered any formal criticism of the Italian government's move. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing): Liu Wendao discussed his imminent departure. After arriving in Nanjing on the 24th, he immediately met with President Wang. Since then, meetings have been frequent, as President Wang concurrently serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and I am a member of the foreign affairs department, so these meetings are very ordinary. On the morning of the 25th, I accepted Commander Gu Zhenglun's invitation to give a lecture at the Gendarmerie Training Class. Due to rain and dampness on the grounds, the lecture was given in the YMCA auditorium. The content was purely about gendarmerie issues. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the lecture at the YMCA was about Italian issues, which is an error. This year, the disaster in Hubei province is severe. Due to my ancestral ties, I will do my best to raise relief funds. The method is to deduct a portion of each person's salary as a donation. For salaries of 800 yuan, 130 yuan will be donated; for salaries of 700 yuan, 120 yuan will be donated. The less the salary, the smaller the donation. I have already donated 130 yuan. However, the amount of donations from those living abroad is very small. The total amount needed for Hubei disaster relief is estimated to be seven or eight million yuan. The Hubei provincial government has already raised over one million yuan, leaving a shortfall of six or seven million. Discussions are currently underway with various parties to determine how to raise the remaining funds, and no decision has been made. I will go to Shanghai on the evening of the 26th, and will return within a few days. My departure abroad will be after the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Before the session, I will frequently travel to various places to meet with people and talk casually. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou): Liu Wendao arrived in Jiangxi to meet with Chiang, and is scheduled to pass through Hankou to Hunan at the end of the month to visit He Jian, before returning to his hometown of Guangji. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Reactionary Organizations in North China <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Traitors Willing to be Accomplices of the Wicked</p>
<p>The So-Called "Humanitarian Benevolence Society" Exists</p>
<p>(Beiping): A person from Tangshan reports that recently, reactionary elements, taking advantage of the special environment in the war zone, have openly organized fake groups such as the "Humanitarian Benevolence Society" and the "Revive Manchuria Society." The headquarters of the "Humanitarian Benevolence Society" is located in a certain concession in Tianjin, with several branches established in various parts of the war zone. Each branch has two directors. The Tangshan branch is named the "Tangshan Second Branch of the North China Branch of the Humanitarian Benevolence Society," with Sheng Guocai as the director and Liu Rudong as the deputy director. They are secretly guided and funded by the chairman of the Tangshan branch of a certain country's resident association. Members fill out application forms, and any illegal activities are handled by that country's military police under extraterritoriality, with local authorities not allowed to interfere. As a result, the society has developed rapidly, with mostly lower-class people joining. Traitors who have joined include Yao Mingshan, Liu Shaotang, Han Caizhang, Geng Zixiang, Cheng Yushan, Cui Zhen, Gao Junpeng, Gu Lanting, and others. The "Revive Manchuria Society" is affiliated with the "Humanitarian Benevolence Society," and its organization is extremely secretive, with significant political implications. It is divided into three detachments within the war zone, all under the secret leadership of a certain country. Funding is also provided monthly by that country. It is reported that the commander of the first detachment, stationed in Yuguan, is Qi Longwu. He has recruited followers and formed a plainclothes team of about 2,000 men, with 300 guns and 15,000 rounds of ammunition. The second detachment is stationed in Luanxian, with Han Shutian as the commander. In Qian'an, Chengde, Bianting, Luanxian, and other places, he has recruited about 3,000 traitors and formed a plainclothes team of 2,000 men, with 400 guns and over 20,000 rounds of ammunition. The third detachment is stationed in Tangshan, with its guidance department in Yutian. The commander, Zhao Dazhong, has recruited four or five thousand vagrants and obtained 200 handguns, over 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and 500 wooden fake guns. Although their activities are very active, our security forces and local police and militia are taking strict precautions and suppressing them everywhere. It is quite difficult for them to stage an uprising. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Authorities Order Counties to Defend, Search, and Suppress</p>
<p>(Tianjin): A group of bandits, numbering about several dozen, with newly manufactured firearms, has been discovered in the Shuipingkou area of Zunhua. It is rumored to be Liu Guitang's bandit gang. The militia of the county's first district has already gone to intercept them. Sixty-odd bandits from Funing County have infiltrated and plan to disturb the urban and rural areas. Zhou Yuying, the commander of the First Regiment of Hebei Security, led his troops to encircle and suppress them, capturing the bandit leader Wang and over ten bandits. The remaining bandits scattered. Several hundred bandits have recently been discovered in Yiyuankou and Haiyangzhen near Shanhaiguan, roaming and harassing without a fixed location. When chased by the police, they flee outside the Great Wall or east of the Shi River. Our armed police are unable to pursue and eliminate them due to the restrictions of the War Zone Agreement. Rumors are rampant in various counties in eastern Luan, and the county magistrates, seeing the bandits' presence in their jurisdictions and the completeness of their firearms, including heavy weapons, suspect that someone is manipulating them from behind, and have telegraphed the provincial authorities for instructions. The authorities have ordered them to strictly supervise the team defenses, search, and suppress them without懈怠, in order to curb乱萌. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin): A group of bandits who fled from the border between Yutian and Zunhua counties recently kidnapped dozens of men and women from various villages along the way and fled into the Yanshan Mountains. The bandits are holding heavy weapons such as mountain cannons, mortars, and machine guns, and are resisting stubbornly. Shen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Zunhua County, has led the militia chiefs Ma Jianchi and Sun Ying of the Third District Team and over 500 police officers to assist Wang Zhanyuan, the commander of the Security Team, in suppressing them. The militia teams of Ji County and Yutian are also rushing to intercept them. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping): The bandits who recently crossed over from outside the Great Wall are related to Wu Runbi, the murderer in the Miyakoshi case. The two groups, totaling over 300 people, have been largely dealt with after being encircled and suppressed by the Zunhua Security Team in Da and Xiao Jizhuang. The remaining bandits fled towards Yutian. A telegram was received from Yutian yesterday stating that the bandits had reached the Matoushan and Huangshan areas on the border of Zunhua and Yutian. The joint suppression plan of the security teams of Ji County, Yutian, and Zunhua is being coordinated. Chen Baosheng, the magistrate of Yutian County, received the joint suppression order and led Sun Shengwu's troops and the security team towards Matoushan on the afternoon of the same day.

<p>Yesterday's foreign telegrams stated that the Parisian forums are recently quite concerned about changes in Hungary's international policies. In March of this year, Hungary and Italy established a compromise. At that time, German-Italian relations were considered close, so the combination of Italy and Hungary was not surprising. However, on July 25th, a coup occurred in Austria, fundamentally shaking the past basis of German-Italian compromise. As a result, Hungary's external relations, whether for or against, became a major problem. Because Hungary, in the current European political situation, has not fundamentally escaped the stage of colonialization, its international relations do not allow for neutrality or ambiguity.</p>
<p>Now, in whose hands will this Hungarian deer ultimately die? This not only requires the Parisian forums to have doubts (alliance with Italy? New Germany?), but also requires us, as observers, to assess the nine million Hungarian people who are under the control of European hegemonic powers. Hungary's international relations have indeed reached a crucial turning point. According to a Paris telegram on the 24th, the French Foreign Minister's return to Geneva has three major tasks, one of which is to carry out a plan to guarantee Austria's independence. Why is the French Foreign Minister so busy on the road? Of course, it is to cope with Germany, and the proper handling of the Hungarian issue is probably also related.</p>
<p>To ask what Hungary's external relations are really like, we believe that it should be observed from an economic perspective, especially from Hungary's international financial relations. Economics is the main tool for major powers to control colonies. Since the end of the Great War, the economic life of the people in Hungary has been almost entirely manipulated by major powers. Because financial revenues and expenditures are insufficient, foreign debt accounts for 70% of the total debt. In terms of commerce and finance, the debt burden is even heavier. When the Central European financial crisis occurred in 1931, Hungarian commercial banks had more than 800 million Pengő (Danish currency) of foreign current debt. It is conceivable that Hungary has completely become a vassal of European capital-exporting countries in terms of finance. Secondly, in terms of foreign trade, although Hungary, on the one hand, consumes German goods, accounting for 22% of annual imports, its largest customer is its neighbor Austria, accounting for about 30% of total exports. This increases Austria's need for the Hungarian people. In short, by observing Hungary's international financial and trade relations to observe its diplomatic path, it seems that the Berlin route may not have a very successful hope. Observing from the Paris side, it is said that Hungary has obtained unlimited economic benefits after its closeness to Italy. Although this is one-sided French propaganda, from the perspective that Italy has given considerable convenience to Hungary's access to the sea, it is of course very likely that France and Italy will try to induce political closeness to Hungary. However, we believe that Hungary can become a vassal under German hegemony, but its status may be different under the approach of France and Italy. Whether it can maintain its old status is difficult to say. Therefore, the change in Hungary's international policy is indeed an important issue in the Central European dispute.</p>

<p>Imposing Sanctions to Guarantee Austrian Sovereignty</p>
<p>France and the Little Entente Advocate League of Nations Oversight</p>
<p>Italy Seeks Independent Action in Central Europe</p>
<p>(Geneva) Negotiations between France and Italy regarding Austrian independence have reached a deadlock. Representatives from both countries held a special meeting today, but they could not even agree on issuing a declaration reaffirming Austria's territorial integrity and independence. Italy clearly does not want to involve the League of Nations in this issue; its main desire is to conclude an agreement guaranteeing Austria's sovereignty and stipulating sanctions in case of future incidents or aggression against Austria. France, encouraged by Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, suggests that sanctions should be approved or implemented under the supervision of the League of Nations. (Reuter's dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The impasse at the Anglo-French-Italian conference in Geneva over the issue of Austrian independence has caused dissatisfaction among the French press. The Echo de Paris stated that the deadlock on the Austrian issue is due to Italy's desire to act independently in Central Europe. Although the French government is willing to compromise with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, France cannot arbitrarily accept Italy's demands. L'Oeuvre criticizes Italy's monopoly over Austrian affairs, saying that Italy's policies will inevitably alienate its neighbors. The attitude of the Austrian representatives is also considered peculiar, and the fact that the Austrian independence issue remains unresolved is not without reason.

<p>Stating the Railway's Sovereign Ownership</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Still Does Not Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Nanjing) For the past week, Japanese telegrams have been widely reporting that Soviet Russia and the puppet Manchuria are renegotiating the transfer of the Sino-Soviet Railway and that an agreement is imminent. According to our foreign affairs authorities, (Japan is eager to complete the purchase of the Sino-Soviet Railway because the international situation has changed with the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations. If the transfer negotiations are allowed to drag on and remain unresolved, the dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union cannot be quelled, and an unexpected situation may develop. Therefore, Japan is quickly seeking a resolution to this issue in order to find a way to reach a temporary compromise with the Soviet Union. The current claims that negotiations are about to be concluded are all propaganda from the Japanese side. Whether the Soviet Union genuinely intends to reduce the price from 200 million to 170 million yuan is still questionable. The announcement of the conclusion of the transfer negotiations is merely premature diplomatic speculation. However, if such a transfer does occur, it would be a blatantly illegal act that disregards our country's territory and sovereignty. Upon receiving an official telegram, we will immediately issue a firm statement to declare the railway's sovereign ownership). (Xin Sheng News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

The Foreign Minister was attending a Privy Council meeting, so Director-General Togo of the Eurasian Bureau met with him instead. He explained the Foreign Ministry's mediation efforts since the breakdown of the negotiations and advised (Manchukuo) to accept the compromise plan with patience and engage in formal negotiations with Soviet Russia.

<p>(Dalian) It is reported that the (Manchukuo) authorities, due to the impending conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Railway transfer negotiations, are now proposing a plan to merge the Sino-Soviet Railway with the South Manchuria Railway and other railways in Manchuria into one. It is also reported that once the contract for the sale of the Sino-Soviet Railway is signed, the route from Changchun to Harbin will have three rails for military use and for the passage of narrow-gauge South Manchuria Railway trains and broad-gauge Sino-Soviet Railway trains. The journey between Dalian and Harbin is planned to take 12 hours. After Tokyo verified the agreement on the transfer of the Sino-Soviet Railway, the tense public sentiment here has greatly eased. (Reuter's dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister also advised (Manchukuo) to endure the compromise plan, hoping that the negotiations would proceed smoothly. Later, he proposed that, in view of the past circumstances, the outline of the negotiations could be handled by me and Mr. Yurenev, and that Representative Ohashi should formally negotiate with Yurenev until the signing when a general understanding is reached. Representative Ohashi expressed his deep gratitude for the Foreign Minister's mediation and had no objection to the negotiations between Hirota and Yurenev. He also requested further mediation in the future before leaving. As a result, the outline of the negotiations will be handled by Foreign Minister Hirota instead of Representative Ohashi, in consultation with the Manchukuo side, and negotiations with Russia will proceed. However, the details will be agreed upon by Manchuria and Russia, so Foreign Minister Hirota will meet with Ambassador Yurenev within two or three days to conduct the transfer negotiations. This meeting seems likely to conclude within two or three days. (Dentsu dispatch, 26th)</p>

That is, the successful resolution of the Eastern Railway negotiations does not mean that peace between Japan, (Manchukuo) and Russia has been completely established. The urgent issue to be resolved is the withdrawal of Red Army guards from the Russo-Manchukuo border. In order to study this issue, the Foreign Minister plans to establish a trilateral commission to implement concrete work in order to eliminate the uneasy atmosphere in the Far East. At the same time, he will negotiate issues such as the North Sakhalin oil issue, the North Pacific fisheries issue, and the ruble conversion issue, to eliminate all causes of conflict between Russia and Japan, and to establish a demilitarized zone on the border between Russia, Japan, and (Manchukuo) to ensure the establishment of peace in the Far East.

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Hoshino, the Director-General of the Finance Department of (Manchukuo), is traveling east this time to discuss important conditions such as the method of raising funds after the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations, including issuing public bonds and paying with commodities. According to his words, it is not convenient to talk definitively about the amount of funds required to purchase the railway, but one-third of the sale price will be paid in cash, and even if half of the cash is to be paid immediately, it will not be a large amount. Initially, it will be necessary to raise about 50 million yuan, and the method of raising these funds will naturally depend on the assistance of the Japanese market. As for whether to issue (Manchukuo) national bonds, or to issue public bonds by the Sino-Soviet Railway, or to issue public bonds by the South Manchuria Railway, allowing (Manchukuo) to borrow, all these forms cannot be foreseen before research, but in theory, it seems that (Manchukuo) bonds would be reasonable.

Kuznetzov pointed out that (if such incidents continue, the consequences are unimaginable. For example, on September 11, a military train ignored traffic regulations and proceeded without the approval of the bureau. At that time, a shunting train was coming on the track, but fortunately, the shunter was quick and agile, and the two trains were prevented from colliding). Kuznetzov requested Li to appeal to the local officials to strictly prohibit the military command from engaging in such illegal actions in the future. On the same day, Kuznetzov sent another letter to Li Shaogeng, reporting that the railway guards had closed the railway club at Suifenhe Station and occupied the club building at Hailar Station.

The French representative agreed with the views of the other representatives, expressing satisfaction. Spanish representative Madariaga believed that since the committee had already approved Afghanistan's accession, there was no need to call for a roll-call vote.

<p>Crackdown on Opium Requires Cooperation from Major Powers</p>
<p>Russian Women Prostituting Themselves Mostly in Concessions</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Fifth Committee of the League of Nations met on the 22nd to discuss the opium problem. The Chinese representative spoke, briefly stating that the British representative reported at the meeting that 128 kilograms of Guang Dong heroin were seized in Hong Kong, and it could not be proven that they were manufactured in China. Although this number is large, it is still less than the amount of foreign narcotics seized in China. Next, he briefly reported on the content of the regulations promulgated by our country this year to crack down on opium, and said that it is difficult to achieve results in cracking down on opium without the cooperation of the major powers, especially since a certain country's punishment of its own private dealers is too light, and its cooperation is irresponsible. The rapporteur, the Spanish representative, then said that since China has already promulgated strict laws, it is hoped that they will be effective. On the same day, the Sixth Committee met to discuss the refugee relief case, which involved the problem of poor White Russian women prostituting themselves in China. After our representative, Minister Qian Tai, explained, based on the League of Nations investigation report, that these women came from Harbin, which is in a special situation, and that the prostitution sites, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou, are mostly located within concessions, which are beyond the government's jurisdiction, but our government is willing to provide assistance in this matter. The joint sub-group of the Fifth and Sixth Committees then discussed and proposed that this issue should be discussed at a planned conference on the abolition of Oriental prostitution, and that the League of Nations Secretariat should contact relevant local agencies to conduct on-site investigations, research, and relief methods, and report to the Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People. The Second Committee also met to discuss health work, and the Indian representative mentioned the International Conference on Rural Health in East Asia, saying that this matter will be prepared non-formally in Nanjing in October. The representative also contacted our representative, Minister Jin Wensi, and asked for support, which was expressed. The committee members then discussed the resolutions of the Madrid News Conference last year. In addition to declaring his support for the resolution, our representative, Jin, reiterated our country's declaration with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other 16 countries on preventing the publication of inaccurate news, as well as the declaration of a certain member of the European Party Department criticizing the "sweeping" proposal.

The court's verdict has now made the sugar issue secondary, as this verdict may have the power to change the organizational structure of the Hawaiian government. When examining the Honolulu issue, the opinions of the War and Navy Departments of the government are very important. Both departments have always advocated using a commission system to abolish the current representative system. According to observers here, at present, because the future of the naval treaty is difficult to predict, and Pearl Harbor is the only base for the US Navy in the Pacific, the claims of the War and Navy authorities have become stronger. Therefore, Washington's attitude toward the Honolulu incident will be based on strategic aspects due to the naval situation, and the people of all ethnic groups in Honolulu may soon lose the political right to organize a government with self-selected representatives.

<p>Postponed to Next Spring</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Third International Congress was originally scheduled to be held in October or November of this year, but the Soviet authorities have now decided to postpone it to early next year. This move has greatly disappointed the figures of the Third International, as more than 1,000 revolutionary leaders have already planned to come to the Red Capital to attend, and some important representatives have already arrived here to wait. Representatives who have not yet departed have now been notified to postpone their departure. According to reports, the reason for the postponement of the Third International Congress is said to be due to Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations.

<p>Displacing 73,000 Tons</p>
<p>Named the Queen Mary</p>
<p>Glasgow: The largest passenger ship ever built by a British shipyard, the number (534), displacing 73,000 tons, was safely launched into the River Clyde today. The Queen of England attended the ceremony and named it the Queen Mary. Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country came to watch the ceremony, and tens of thousands of others listened to the broadcast of the ceremony on the radio. The King and Queen, accompanied by the Crown Prince, departed from Balmoral Castle at 9:00 AM this morning and arrived here. At 2:50 PM, the shipyard of John Brown &amp; Company ascended the imperial platform and received enthusiastic cheers from countless people. Kirkwood, a Labor Party member of the House of Commons, was most influential in the recommencement of work on this ship. Therefore, the directors of Cunard White Star Line first met the King and Queen to offer a welcome message, and the King replied as follows: (The storms of the ocean are treacherous and difficult to overcome, and their power is stronger than human beings, but in modern times, the struggle with the ocean has been matched. It has not been a hundred years since the late Cunard founded the wooden-hulled steamship to carry mail across the Atlantic. Today, there must be someone who remembers being surprised to hear about a steamship of 1,150 tons when they were young. Comparing the past with the present, we can see how human power has overcome nature. Today, we are honored to witness the launching of this giant ship that surpasses all others.) At this point, the King thanked all those who contributed to the construction of the ship, from dignitaries to laborers, and said that he had been concerned about the ship's three-year suspension of work, and he was now delighted to see it completed. He affirmed that (commerce on both sides of the Atlantic now has the hope of improving, and this ship will be able to make a great contribution to the revival of international trade. In the past, Cunard built ships to carry mail to English-speaking countries, and today, Cunard is building this ship to carry a large number of passengers to foreign countries, so that they can better understand each other. We use this ship to convey goodwill to all countries, and we wish this ship a life at sea that can unfold friendship among all countries.) At the time of the ceremony, there was a heavy rain, but hundreds of thousands of spectators stood and stared as the new ship was launched, which took only 60 seconds. The King, wearing a naval admiral's uniform, delivered his speech, and then the Queen performed the naming ceremony. At this time, the crowd was silent, and the Queen said into the microphone, (I name you Queen Mary.) At that time, the sound of cheering was deafening. The Queen broke a bottle of wine against the bow of the ship, and then pressed a button, and the ship moved. Six tugboats towed it into the river. The imperial viewing platform was shaped like a wheelhouse and had three thrones. 2,000 police officers maintained order along the route, and 3,000 ambulances were prepared. The workers who built the ship sat in a special viewing platform, and five shipwrights over the age of 50 were summoned by the King and others. After the new ship was launched, the King and others had refreshments.

<p>Facing criticism from all sides for handling labor disputes</p>
<p>Baruch favored as successor</p>
<p>The end of the separation of powers and the autocratic system</p>
<p>Hyde Park: General Hugh S. Johnson is to resign from his position as head of the National Recovery Administration today, thus immediately relinquishing his role as a dictator in the American business community. His resignation has been approved by President Roosevelt. Johnson will officially leave office on October 15. His letter of resignation states that he shares the same views as the President regarding the reorganization of the NRA and hopes that the President can also understand that his resignation is due to the fact that his position will become superfluous after the reorganization. However, he will continue to be loyal to the President and is willing to serve the President if circumstances permit. President Roosevelt's reply was very cordial, praising Johnson's spirit, courage, and various achievements, and expressing the hope that he can continue to serve the country after a period of rest. According to a statement from (Summer White House), Johnson's resignation is not due to disagreements with the President. However, political observers believe that the victory of NRA advisor Donald Richberg and his theory of cooperation between the government and the business community in governing industry is the real reason for Johnson's resignation. Yesterday, some people predicted that Johnson would be forced to resign and that the world-renowned financier Bernard Baruch would become the chairman of the committee, with other members including early "brain trust" members such as Moley and Richberg. Baruch has now relinquished all important positions and claims that he will devote himself to (writing). Therefore, although he has not yet made any statements, he will be able to take office immediately if appointed by the government. According to today's news, the reorganization plan of the NRA will be announced in Washington soon. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park: After General Johnson's resignation as head of the National Recovery Administration, it is now the opinion of people here tonight that the autocratic system of the NRA will come to an end. The reorganization plan of the NRA will divide the powers concentrated in Johnson into three parts. First, there will be a council to determine the policies of the NRA, composed of representatives from the government, the industrial sector, and labor organizations. Second, there will be an executive committee to implement the policies set by the council. Third, there will be a legal department to handle litigation matters related to violations of regulations. Now that Johnson has resigned, the policy changes and reorganization of the NRA have not been announced. However, according to tonight's news, President Roosevelt will retain the ban on child labor and wage standards, while granting the industrial sector some autonomy. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York): President Roosevelt will arrive in Washington tomorrow to discuss everything with Johnson. Before leaving office, Johnson will also make a final report to President Roosevelt. In recent months, Johnson's measures have been heavily criticized, and he has had disagreements with Labor Secretary Frances Perkins. Therefore, his resignation was expected. It is widely believed that Johnson's handling of the textile labor dispute was criticized as inappropriate in some respects, which is also one of the reasons for Johnson's resignation. This morning, New York newspapers reported that the film industry is considering hiring Johnson for a certain position with an annual salary of $100,000. There are currently three hopefuls to succeed Johnson as head of the NRA: Bernard Baruch, a well-known New York financier; Professor Moley, a former member of President Roosevelt's brain trust; and Swope, the deputy director of the NRA.

<p>(New York): Although Hauptmann still claims to be innocent in the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby today, the prosecutor has declared that there is evidence that Hauptmann received $50,000 in ransom money from Lindbergh. Lawyer Foley declared that detectives who searched Hauptmann's bedroom discovered that he had been in contact with Dr. Condon, who served as an intermediary in the ransom negotiations.

<p>(London): There are over 130,000 coal miners in the South Wales coal region, and a strike is looming. Labor and management have been negotiating new wages in Cardiff for a long time, but have not yet reached a resolution. If an agreement cannot be reached within three days, a work stoppage on October 1st seems inevitable. The Coal Owners' Association issued an article stating that the previous meeting had completely reached a deadlock, and the coal owners are not prepared to increase the minimum wage. The current minimum wage is only 12.25% higher than in 1914, while the National Industrial Board advocates an increase of 20% to 28%. However, the coal owners insist that they are already paying 20% and cannot increase it further. They are willing to submit the dispute to an impartial and independent committee organized by the Ministry of Labor. The Miners' Federation is scheduled to hold a general meeting on the 28th of this month, and its final decision will be announced the following day. Secretary for Mines Ernest Brown has now invited representatives from labor and management to London by the 27th of this month to discuss solutions in order to eliminate obstacles and reach a resolution. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London): The Gresford coal mine in North Wales exploded last Saturday, killing 260 people. It was the third largest mine disaster of this century. Because the fire in the mine was difficult to extinguish, the mine entrance was closed. Unexpectedly, the fire and gas under the mine spewed out from the cracks in the closure today. With a roar, it knocked an employee twenty yards away from where he was standing, seriously injuring him, and there is no hope of survival. The work of sealing the mine entrance must be implemented once again. As a result of this disaster, 2,500 workers will be directly and indirectly unemployed for one to three months. Most tragically, over 700 children are now orphans. The City of London has begun to raise funds to provide relief, and donations are pouring in from all over the country, with some donations as high as several five pounds. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>

Johnson, the director of the National Recovery Administration, it is expected that President Roosevelt will announce the reorganization of the Recovery Administration within a few days, which is beneficial to both commerce and the market. (2) The new regulations on securities trading margin are not expected to be very stringent, which greatly excites the bulls. Yesterday's price rebound and the increase in trading after the price increase are signs of a good market. The unfavorable factors for the market are: (1) Textile mills are resuming operations slowly due to a lack of orders. (2) Unstable foreign exchange. The market was more active and stable at the opening of securities this morning than before. Although there were occasional profit-takings, sentiment was better than yesterday.

<h3 id="e86">The Steps of Japanese and Puppet Activities in Our Western Mongolia <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Threaten Princes and Lamas</p>
<p>Surveying the Mountains and Terrain of Each Banner</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Suiyuan: Since the Japanese and puppet troops occupied Dolon in May last year, they have never stopped thinking about advancing into various parts of Western Mongolia, including the Twelve Banners of (Chahar), the Seven Banners of the Xilingol League (Suiyuan), the Six Banners of the Ulanqab League, the Seven Banners of the Yekejuu League, the Tumet Independent Banner (Ningxia), and the Alxa Independent Banner, all within their plan. The methods are roughly divided into three stages: The first stage (military aggression) in the summer of last year, Japanese and puppet troops and a small number of Mongolians marched west from Chengde and Dolon to the various banners of Chahar and Xilingol bordering Rehe under the pretext of suppressing bandits, hoping to gain an inch and then a foot. Unexpectedly, as soon as the Japanese and puppet troops entered Western Mongolia, the local Mongolians, princes, and governors were shocked, giving Western Mongolia an impression of aversion to evil. The Japanese and puppets then changed their strategy and used the second stage (method of inducement) last year. However, the Mongolians of the Twelve Banners of Chahar were the first to be enlightened and were mostly unmoved. Although the banners of the Xilingol League were less knowledgeable, they were also deeply afraid of the Japanese and dared not approach them. Moreover, the leaders of the western part of the Xilingol League, such as Prince De, were advocating Mongolian autonomy, which was even more incompatible with the Japanese side's propaganda of inducement. Because the second phase method failed, the Japanese and puppets used the third stage (resolute measures) and harassed in various ways. The Sokh Prince's Mansion in the Left Wing of the East Ujimqin Banner in the northeast of the Xilingol League (Sokh is the head of the Xilingol League) is adjacent to Rehe. After a long period of harassment by the Japanese and puppets last winter, its palace was forcibly set up with a radio station, and a Japanese lived permanently in the palace, appearing as if he were the master. This summer, the Japanese came to the Lama Temple of Beizi Chao in the east of Xilingol and forcibly set up a radio station. Eight Japanese, two Mongolian clerks, and two old banner people from Beiping were stationed in the temple for a long time, and established a puppet country's special agent commissioner's office in the temple, with the same organization as Dolon, with great power, responsible for major missions such as military, diplomatic, and investigation, and its subordinates have been more active in various parts of Western Mongolia since the summer of this year. On the one hand, they went to various princes and Lama temples to publicize the foreign policy of the puppet state, and on the other hand, they went to various banners in Western Mongolia to investigate mountains and terrain in batches. At the beginning of this month, the special agent commissioner of Beizi Temple suddenly dispatched more than ten cars, several civil and military officials, and more than ten Mongolian soldiers to Prince De's mansion in Bangjiang, requesting Prince De to negotiate. At that time, Prince De was returning to the mansion from Bailingmiao, and only left the mansion to return to the temple last week. According to a traveler from Bangjiang, the Japanese came this time to set up a radio station in the east of the Prince's mansion and to discuss the establishment of the so-called North China Hospital in the Prince's mansion. As for how Prince De dealt with it, the outside world does not yet know. The puppet country's ambition to encroach on Western Mongolia has been repeatedly exposed.</p>
<p>Recently, the number of Japanese who have come to Zhangjiakou under the pretext of investigation and travel has been increasing. They are all claimed to be conducting investigations. It is heard that Military Officer Matsui recently came to Zhangjiakou from Rehe in his personal capacity and rented a house belonging to a certain surname in front of the railway, with the words "Matsui Residence" pasted on the gate. This action must have a special purpose. There is also Mr. Shengdao, a Japanese who has lived in Zhangjiakou for many years, 50 years old, who is the current chief of the Special Agent Office of Beizi Temple in Western Mongolia. Recently, he has been frequently traveling between Changchun and Beizi Temple, directing all work. His residence in Zhangjiakou is on Shahe Road in Tou'ergou. He married a Chinese woman as his wife, whose family is originally from Wanquan County, thirty li north of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Preparations for the Office of the Mongolian Political Guidance Commissioner <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Men Bingyue and Chun Heming Ordered to Go to Bailingmiao for Consultation</p>
<p>Scope of Organization Will Be Smaller Than Originally Planned</p>
<p>Dispatch from Beiping: The Mongolian Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee will have been established for half a year. In the past five months, autonomous political affairs have been unsuccessful due to (1) the indefinite assumption of office by the Guidance Commissioner and (2) the failure to receive political funding on time. Since General He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Branch of the Committee, was appointed as the concurrent Guidance Commissioner, the delay in assuming office has its own difficulties that must be considered. Since General He has been stationed in Beiping, his responsibilities have been very heavy. He has been busy day and night and has had no free time. Moreover, the complexity of Mongolian affairs cannot be handled by remote guidance. Therefore, he has repeatedly declined and telegraphed the Central Government to appoint another capable person. On the other hand, the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee was bewildered by the indefinite assumption of office by the Guidance Commissioner. Envoys traveled incessantly on the Ping-Sui Road, expressing their sincerity in supporting General He in addition to urging him to assume office as soon as possible. The Central Government also repeatedly telegraphed General He to assume office as soon as possible, so as to relieve the Central Government's concern for the north. After repeated telegraphic communications, General He has now decided to send Men Bingyue, a senior counselor of the Military Branch of the Committee, and others to Bailingmiao to meet with Yun Duanwangchuk, Chairman of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, and Prince De, a member of the Committee, De Wangde. Men is scheduled to take the Pingbao through train to Suiyuan at 7:00 AM tomorrow (26th). Several members of the General Staff of the Military Branch of the Committee will also accompany him. According to sources, Men and others will stay in Suiyuan for a considerable period of time when they return from Bailingmiao, so that they can report the results of the consultations in the temple to General He and await further instructions.</p>
<p>It is also learned that Men and others are going to Suiyuan under the order of General He to prepare for the establishment of the Office of the Guidance Commissioner. The reason for going to Bailingmiao first is that on the one hand, they will represent General He in extending greetings to all members of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and, as convenient, inform them that General He has decided to telegraph the Central Government to request monthly payments of funds to the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee to avoid stagnation in political affairs. Regarding the scope of the organization of the Office of the Guidance Commissioner, due to financial reasons, the original organization will be reduced accordingly. The content is divided into offices, with sections established below. Some of the candidates for the positions of director and section chief have already been internally decided, and General He will issue a clear order when he actually assumes office in the future. Regarding the address of the Office of the Commissioner, it has been generally decided to locate it in Suiyuan. After the organization of the office is ready, General He will take an oath of office in Beiping on a scheduled date, lead the political office remotely, and send Men Bingyue to station in Suiyuan to take responsibility for transmission. As for General He's personal visit to Suiyuan, as of the time of dispatch, the relevant parties have stated that there are no such preparations. According to general speculation, General He's trip to Suiyuan may only be a matter of time. It is also unknown, because since the Office of the Guidance Commissioner is planned to be established in Suiyuan, it would be appropriate for General He to personally inspect it. (25th)</p>

<p>Japanese Toyota Visits Qufu, Refused Meeting by Kong</p>
<p>Kong Clan to Release Statement</p>
<p>Shandong Province Conference on Repairing the Confucius Temple is Underway</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Japanese recently suddenly advocate venerating Confucius, in addition to greatly repairing the Confucius Temple, also planning to hold a Confucius sacrificial ceremony next spring. According to a dispatch from the Japanese United News Agency on the 21st of this month, Japan has decided to hold a Confucius sacrificial ceremony next spring, inviting over a hundred prominent scholars from China, Korea, and Taiwan to hold a grand Eastern academic lecture, placing our country alongside Korea and Taiwan, which were forcibly occupied by the Japanese. This is extremely insulting to us. The news agency also said that the 77th generation descendant of Confucius, the Duke Yansheng, his uncle Kong Lingcan, descendants of the Meng and Yan families, and leading Confucian scholars of the time will be invited to Japan to participate, etc. The Japanese's actions are harboring ulterior motives. If Confucius knew, he would never accept the sacrificial rites of the tyrannical Japanese. Even Kong Decheng, who has received considerable education, and Kong Lingcan, currently the head of the First Section of the Education Bureau, would certainly not be obsequious and go to Japan to participate in the Confucius sacrificial ceremony at a time when our national humiliation is still unavenged. According to Kong Lingcan, regarding this matter, he has recently learned of something else that can corroborate this. A Japanese man named Toyota once went to Qufu to request an audience with Kong Decheng, but was refused. Kong Decheng also resolved not to receive any Japanese who come to Qufu in the future, to avoid complications. Based on this, it is evident that the Japanese are not merely engaging in propaganda but actually want to implement their deceptive policy. Their intention is not only to insult but must have other purposes. In the future, the Kong clan will have to issue a statement to the world, publicly denying this. Kong Decheng, being educated and cultured, would definitely not allow himself to be fooled by the Japanese and bring shame upon the sage, etc.</p>
<p>Further news: Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun and Education Director He Siyuan proposed repairing the Kuiwen Pavilion of the Confucius Temple to create an ancient artifact exhibition hall, which was approved by the provincial government. A letter was sent to the Confucius Temple Repair Preparatory Committee to inform them. Today (the 25th), the preparatory committee held a meeting in the West Flower Hall of the provincial government, chaired by Han Fuju. (A) Matters reported: (1) Since the 13th standing committee meeting, 2,000 yuan in foreign currency was received from Chen Jitang, bringing the total to 4,022.05 yuan. It was resolved to deposit it in the Minsheng Bank. (2) A telegram from Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie on the 20th stated that he was honored to be appointed as honorary vice president for the repair of the Confucius Temple and would do his best to contribute to the grand undertaking. It was resolved to file it. (3) A letter from the provincial government, based on a submission from the provincial secretariat, stated that the funds donated for the repair of the Yan Temple in Qufu were insufficient to cover expenses, and requested instructions on which item to allocate funds from. After deliberation, it was resolved to first use the existing donations for repairs. The Construction Department was instructed to comply and informed accordingly. It was resolved to file it. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) A letter from the Construction Department forwarding a report from technician Yang Judou stating that he was ordered to inspect the trees growing on the roof of the Confucius Temple. After detailed inspection, there were three locations with trees growing, listed below: (1) Dacheng Hall: A cluster of about five or six trees, all about two meters tall and three or four centimeters in diameter, growing under the front eaves between the roof tiles. (2) Dacheng Gate: A cluster of about four or five trees, about 1.7 or 1.8 meters tall and three or four centimeters in diameter, growing on the roof ridge of the rear eaves. (3) Kuiwen Pavilion: A elm tree, about 3.5 meters tall and six or seven centimeters in diameter, and over ten smaller trees, all about one meter tall and two or three centimeters in diameter, growing under the rear eaves between the roof tiles. There were at least seven or eight other places with trees or grass growing on the roof, but not as large as the three locations above. In view of the previous instructions, the inspection situation was submitted for review. It was resolved to have the Confucius Temple Repair Committee assess and handle the situation. It was resolved to estimate the cost of repairs. (2) A telegram from Dai Chuanxian on the 3rd stated that the repair of the Confucius Temple was a great undertaking to revive the national spirit, and he felt unworthy to be the chairman due to his limited abilities, but would do his best to assist. He asked how to proceed and requested a public decision. It was resolved to file it. (3) A letter from the provincial government stated that at the political affairs meeting of the department, committee members Li and He proposed allocating the remaining funds from the Yan Temple repair to repair the Kuiwen Pavilion of the Confucius Temple and establish an ancient artifact exhibition hall. After discussion, it was resolved to send a letter to the Confucius Temple Repair Preparatory Committee to dispatch personnel for surveying and estimation, and requested instructions on how to proceed. It was resolved that the funds for the Yan Temple project were from over 30,000 yuan allocated from the donations received for the Confucius Temple repair, with the Construction Department allocating funds for construction and no remaining funds. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Anhui Province to Implement Lifting of Rice and Grain Export Ban <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Investigation Shows Food Supply Still Sufficient</p>
<p>Plan to Collect Rice Tax to Allow Export from the Province</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Due to the drought in Anhui Province, the provincial government has followed the example of the major flood of the 20th year of the Republic and implemented a ban on rice exports to maintain the food supply for the people. It has also organized a Food Regulation Committee and dispatched investigation team director Li Zhenya to various places to investigate the amount of rice in storage. Li's investigation showed that although many counties had suffered poor harvests, the number of polder fields was quite large, and the overall food supply seemed to be still sufficient. Moreover, other provinces were already experiencing food shortages and had lifted the ban on trade, which would greatly benefit the rural economy of this province. He truthfully reported this to the provincial government and proposed collecting an export tax on rice and allowing rice to be exported from the province. The revenue from this tax would be used for drought relief. Rice merchants also hoped that the export of rice would be permitted, as it would greatly revitalize commerce and finance. Collecting the tax would clearly indicate restrictions and would not affect the food supply. It is expected that around five million shi (a unit of dry volume) could be exported by both steamer and sailboat. It is said that the provincial government has reviewed the proposal and has decided to implement it. It plans to collect a tax of 4 jiao (a unit of currency) per shi for steamer exports, collected in Wuhu, and 1 yuan per shi for sailboat exports, with an office set up in Heshang Port to handle it. However, the undecided matter is that at a time when harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies are being abolished, likin and surcharges are strictly prohibited. The name and method are still under consideration. The planned implementation date is October 1st. Initially, due to the severity of the drought, it was also planned to pre-borrow 1 million yuan from rice merchants in this area to fund disaster relief, with the rice tax used as collateral. Rice merchants felt uneasy because the rice market has been exhausted for several years and they could not raise such a large sum in a short period of time. After repeated consultations, it was decided to borrow 60,000 yuan to provide urgent relief. However, what worries rice merchants is whether rice and grain will be allowed to pass through Jiangsu Province in the future, even if Anhui Province permits the export. (24th)</p>

<h3 id="e90">Another Appeal Regarding Robbery Case in Silu Lane <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>After the robbery case of the Li family in Silu Lane in this city occurred, everyone believed that it was surprising that a robbery occurred in such a bustling area. It has been five days and the robbers have not been caught, causing great anxiety among the people. Residents of the lane, including Li Shao, Li Zhaoxin, Zhang Huanzhi, Zhang Hangxin, Shu Baoshan, Lu Jingzhi, Lu Jiejin, and Jin Tianxi, jointly telegraphed County Magistrate Jin, stating that the house of Li, the district chief of Silu Lane in this city, was suddenly robbed at 3:00 AM on the 21st, causing panic among nearby residents. Silu Lane is very close to the Xing County Public Security Bureau, and a robbery occurred in this guarded area. This is shocking news that has never happened since Songjiang established a police bureau. Moreover, after the victim reported to the Public Security Bureau, only Inspector Liu and three or four policemen carrying dilapidated firearms arrived after a delay of 40 minutes. No special police officers were dispatched to pursue the robbers. The current Director of the Public Security Bureau, He Yongyao, has been extremely negligent in preventing robbery cases. Furthermore, it has been four days since the incident, and no arrests have been made. Negligence in police affairs could not be more extreme. If this continues, the peace and security of the people's residences will be compromised. The danger during the upcoming winter prevention period is unimaginable. The safety of the citizens' lives and property is at stake, and it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, they urgently request the County Magistrate to investigate and punish the negligent police officers and order a deadline for solving the case to maintain public safety.</p>

<p>Qian Lisan's family in Tangjiaqiao Township outside the West Gate of Changshu was robbed last month, and Qian Lisan's six-year-old son, Qian Shoushi, was kidnapped by the robbers, who demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan. The ransom drop was arranged at the foot of Baishi Mountain, about four li from Hushu Pass Township in Suzhou Prefecture. The victim reported to the Second District of the Water Police, and District Chief Wei ordered detectives Shao Henglong and Mao Wenlong to go to Hushu Pass Township and arrest two kidnappers, Yang Genshou and Xiao Tianji. They also captured Yang Gensheng, Zhao A'san, and Zhao Laotai, who was guarding the kidnapped child, at Zhao Zhai Village in Xijin Bridge, and rescued the young kidnapping victim Qian Shushibao. They were all taken into custody for interrogation. The rescued child was claimed by his family yesterday (26th).</p>

<p>After Jiangsu Province announced the disaster assessment measures, it immediately ordered the district chiefs to instruct the Tu district secretaries and township chiefs to prepare disaster registers listing the number of completely barren and partially barren mu within the county and submit them to the county. It is estimated that there are over 300,000 mu of land affected by the disaster in the county, with an expected harvest of 75%. Yesterday, the county government held a meeting to discuss the approximate autumn harvest figures, presided over by County Magistrate Yan, and decided to submit a special request for a full exemption from the land tax for all affected mu to the county before the 30th of this month. It also appointed autumn assessment committee members for each district. In addition to County Magistrate Yan personally inspecting Districts 1 and 2, Zhang Dezai for District 3, Zang You for District 4, Hu Pinfang for District 5, Fei Yunong for District 6, Chen Yuchu for District 7, Yu Fen for District 8, Shen Xichun for District 9, and Ye Dezhen for District 10 were appointed. They are scheduled to depart immediately to conduct inspections. If there are fields with no harvest at all, they must submit a special report, which will be handled separately after review by the provincial committee. Furthermore, the county party headquarters sent a letter to the county government yesterday stating that, according to a request from the Ninth District branch, special attention should be paid to dry land, insect damage, and rice that looks good but does not produce grain, and that these should be included in the disaster assessment to alleviate the farmers' difficulties.</p>

<p>In recent years, Chinese silk has suffered a sharp decline in the market due to obstacles to overseas sales. Although the government has tried to provide relief, it has been difficult to reverse the trend due to the global economic situation. In May of this year, the New York Mercantile Exchange in the United States allowed Chinese silk to be listed and to be used as a substitute for Japanese silk in deliveries. To regain its original market share in the United States, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and various silk manufacturers in China ordered the Shanghai Standard Inspection Bureau to conduct rigorous inspections of export silk. However, after Chinese silk was listed in the US, Japanese merchants dumped silk at discounted prices. Chinese merchants, with limited economic strength and relying mostly on outdated manufacturing methods, had to suspend trading after just over ten days. Through the efforts of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chinese silk merchants, trading has now resumed intermittently.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Land Price Declaration Case Takes a Sudden Turn <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since the Wuxi Land Price Declaration Office sent personnel to carry out declarations from house to house in the city and suburbs, the process initially proceeded smoothly. However, as soon as people heard that land price tax and land price appreciation tax would be levied after the land declaration, they became suspicious and fearful, and dared not declare. Moreover, land in Wuxi has not been surveyed since the land survey during the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, over seventy years ago. There are many discrepancies in household numbers, and even the declaration of mu is difficult. Therefore, everyone adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Recently, Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government stated that the land price declaration was in accordance with President Chiang Kai-shek's intention to benefit the people, and was originally intended to develop people's livelihood and promote social prosperity. Local people should understand this and cooperate. He specially summoned County Magistrate Yan Shenyu to the province to explain the matter. Qian Jihou, director of the County Property Office, also sent a letter to the county government, stating that what the public organizations and local people feared and suspected was not the land price declaration itself, but the levying of land price tax and land price appreciation tax after the declaration was completed. The current market is depressed, and the economy has plummeted. He requested that the difficulties of the people be considered and that a request be forwarded to the provincial government to postpone the land price tax and land price appreciation tax until the market recovers and autonomy is achieved. County Magistrate Yan returned to Wuxi yesterday morning (26th). It is reported that the provincial government has indicated that it will consider postponing the land price tax. Representatives of various public organizations, including Li Tiping, Qian Sunqing, and Yang Hanxi, are scheduled to convene local people, district chiefs, and township chiefs at the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon (27th) to discuss the matter. The land price declaration, which had been stalled due to disagreements, has now taken a sudden turn.</p>

<p>This summer's drought has caused a complete loss of rice crops in various places, especially in the fifth and sixth districts of this area. The incident of villagers gathering to eat from wealthy households occurred in the Nianbuqiao Township of the sixth district the day before yesterday. To understand the actual situation in various townships, County Magistrate Huan, accompanied by the head of the security team, Chen Bichen, took a public security boat to Lao Wushi in the sixth district at 7:00 AM on the 25th and summoned the township chiefs to talk. He instructed them to increase their responsibility during this time of famine to ensure the stability of the local order. Then, he inspected the fields and saw that the cotton stalks were less than a foot long, withered, and without fruit. He ordered two stalks to be taken for record and reported. It suddenly rained, and the county magistrate and others returned to the district office to rest. He stated that the disaster situation in the sixth district was indeed different from other districts and would be reported to the provincial government to find ways to provide relief. However, this was overheard by local women, who gathered hundreds of people and went to the district office to request to see the county magistrate and demand relief. However, the county magistrate had already returned to his boat and left, so the women dispersed.</p>

<p>This year, Chongming and Qidong counties have been severely affected by disasters. The Commissioner's Office requested the provincial government to exempt the two counties from land tax for one year and to conduct an autumn survey and determine the tax rate starting this year. The provincial government ordered that the land tax of Chongming and Qidong counties had already been generously reduced to avoid disaster relief cases for a long time. The request to conduct an autumn survey in Chongming and Qidong counties starting this year was not approved. Furthermore, exempting land tax for one year concerned provincial and county tax revenue and was even more difficult to approve.</p>

At 4:00 PM, the waiter saw that his face was pale and knew something was wrong, so he reported it to the hotel. He had already stopped breathing and died. He left a suicide note asking to notify Hua Huaiqi of the Hongkou branch of the Bank of Communications. Hua happened to be in Hangzhou watching the tide and went to handle the matter. After inspection by the court, a coffin was prepared and the body was encoffined.</p>

<p>Not Drafting a Separate Proposal</p>
<p>Regarding the recent visit of Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke to Shanghai to discuss constitutional issues with Dr. Wang Chonghui, the reporter investigated the situation yesterday and found that Sun has always advocated an open approach to the constitution-making process. He repeatedly published the initial draft and revised draft to solicit opinions from across the country and appointed three committee members, Chuan Bingchang, Tao Lüqian, and Lin Bin, to conduct a dedicated review. The second review revealed that external discussions were mostly positive about the revised draft as a whole, but opinions on the chapter on the central government were the most divided, making it extremely difficult to reach a consensus. Sun believes that the constitution is of utmost importance to the country's future and that thorough research is essential. As Dr. Wang Chonghui, known for his expertise in law and former legal advisor to the Legislative Yuan, had returned from Europe, Sun assigned Chuan Bingchang, Tao Lüqian, and Lin Bin to come to Shanghai and discuss everything with Wang. Wang met with Chuan, Tao, and Lin over the past two days for detailed discussions, which have yielded significant results. It is said that the presidential system will still be adopted, but the National Assembly Committee will be removed. Chuan and the others plan to return to Beijing with Sun on Thursday evening to further refine the clauses in order to present them at the Legislative Yuan's plenary session this Friday. The report in the newspaper the day before yesterday that Chuan had integrated Sun and Wang's opinions to draft a separate proposal was hearsay and not factual.</p>

Liu arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is staying at the East Asia Hotel. Yesterday morning, he drove to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to meet with Chairman Yu Zuoting and executive committee members Zheng Zenan and Zheng Chengqing for a very cordial discussion. According to Liu, speaking to a reporter from New Sound News Agency, Shanghai-Guangdong commerce is interdependent and knows no boundaries.

It is also heard that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has also sent a representative, Zheng Zenan, to Guangdong to request the abolition of the tax. He set off today.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Chen Youbo, Manager of Shun'an Company, Plotted to Blow Up Shun'an Wheel Unsuccessfully <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Ship Was Detained by the Customs of Sanduao</p>
<p>Manager Chen Youbo Was the Mastermind</p>
<p>Plotting to Blow Up the Ship to Obtain Compensation</p>
<p>Ship Owner Reported to the Customs</p>
<p>Chen Has Been Arrested and Sent to the Police Station</p>
<p>The Shun'an wheel of Shun'an Company in Dunhouli, Zhonghua Road, Shanghai, was fully loaded with more than 1,500 tons of goods on the 14th and sailed to Xinghua, Quanzhou, for unloading. When the ship sailed, Chen Youbo, the manager of the Shanghai branch, instructed the ship owner to increase the insurance amount and secretly detonated explosives, intending to sink the ship and obtain compensation. The reporter personally investigated this shocking news from all sides, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dedicated to Xinghua and Quanzhou Routes: The Shun'an Shipping Company was organized by Zheng Zhongwu (a Fujian native, currently a special member of the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee), Chen Youbo (a native of Xinghua, Fujian), and others. Zheng Zhongwu serves as the chairman, and Chen Youbo serves as the manager of the Shanghai headquarters. It has been open for five or six years. They purchased a Shun'an wheel (formerly the Fusheng), with a net tonnage of 1,177 tons. They have a marine safety insurance of 60,000 yuan with the China United Insurance Company and a deposit of 15,000 yuan with the Hua'an Insurance Company. It operates between Shanghai, Xinghua, and Quanzhou in Fujian, specializing in various groceries. Branch offices are set up in Xinghua and Quanzhou to manage passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Xinghua. The business is quite prosperous.</p>
<p>Manager Suddenly Conceived a Malicious Plan: All the company's power is managed by Chen Youbo. In terms of shipping, it is not likely to lose money. However, Chen Youbo also engages in other speculative businesses on weekdays, and the losses are increasing. Recently, he felt that there was no way to make up for it, so he suddenly had evil thoughts and secretly decided on a malicious plan. Taking advantage of this time when the Shun'an wheel was transporting goods from Shanghai to Xingquan, Chen Youbo specially purchased explosive white medicine cans, intending to order the Shun'an ship owner Ouyang Tai to take out insurance for 1,000 tons of cargo when the ship set sail. When the ship reached outside the Wusongkou, he would detonate the ship, intending to get compensation of about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Agreement to Split the Money Four to Six: When planning this ship bombing, Chen Youbo secretly invited the ship owner Ouyang Tai to discuss it in person. He handed over four cans of explosives and ordered him to detonate the ship as soon as it left Wusong. When the compensation was received in the future, he was willing to reward him with 40%. At that time, Ouyang Tai was forced by the manager's power and did not dare to refuse, so he had to verbally accept the order. He took four cans of explosives and went on board. On the 14th, he set sail from Shanghai to Xingquan.</p>
<p>Ship Owner Pretended to Be Sick on the Way: The ship owner was fundamentally opposed to this matter, but he could not cope with it. Therefore, after the Shun'an wheel sailed out of Wusong, he pretended to be sick on the ship and entrusted the driving to the first and second mates, Sheng Fuchen and Wang Daoji, to manage. Ouyang Tai never told the crew about this matter after arriving on the ship. When the ship arrived at the Wenzhou sea area, the first and second mates reported the voyage to Ouyang Tai, but the ship owner still did not announce the matter.</p>
<p>Surrendered to Sanduao Customs: On the 18th of this month, when the Shun'an wheel was sailing to Sanduao, the ship owner thought that the ship was about to arrive in Quanzhou. If this matter was not announced, the reported export goods would not match, and the customers would definitely pursue it. If the ship was bombed according to Chen Youbo's malicious plan, the relationship would be too great. After repeated consideration, he weighed the pros and cons and told the first and second mates, Sheng and Wang, the detailed reasons for the matter and discussed how to deal with it. After the three discussed, they had to surrender to the Sanduao Customs. They sailed the Shun'an wheel to Sanduao and sent the first mate Sheng Fuchen to report to the Customs.</p>
<p>People and Ships Were Detained Together: After receiving the report, the Sanduao Customs believed that the circumstances were very serious. They immediately detained the Shun'an wheel and the ship owner Ouyang Tai. All the explosives used by Chen Youbo to bomb the entire ship were seized. They immediately sent a secret telegram to Shanghai to investigate the case thoroughly. It was found that the Shun'an wheel was mostly loaded with flour, followed by soybeans, cigarettes, and miscellaneous goods. They are now also blocked in Sanduao. In recent days, many customers and cargo owners have been inquiring about the matter with the company.</p>
<p>Chen Youbo Has Been Arrested: After the Shun'an wheel was detained, Chen Youbo, the Shanghai manager, got the news and took the opportunity to abscond. The company's affairs were suspended. At the same time, Zheng Zhongwu, the chairman of the company, believed that the manager's improper behavior had discredited the company. He specially sent someone to Chen Youbo's residence at No. 57, Tongshouli, Datong Road, Avenue Edward VII, to look for him, but he was nowhere to be found. Therefore, he reported to the Public Security Bureau and other police agencies to track him down. He was finally arrested by Zheng Zhongwu on the way in Lujiazui at 2 pm the day before yesterday and sent to the police station. There were only three or four staff and students in the company. The rest of the important staff had all absconded. Chen Youbo has been detained by the French Concession police and will be sent to court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Insurance Statement of Withdrawal: The Shun'an wheel of Shun'an Shipping Company is insured for 60,000 yuan by the China Ship Insurance Association at No. 38, Avenue Edward VII. The company also pledged 15,000 yuan to the Hua'an Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road. According to Tang Danhua, the manager of the China Insurance Association, although it has not been confirmed whether it was a fraud to obtain compensation, there is indeed a situation of mutual contention among the crew members. It is found that sailing a ship is not comparable to land. A slight oversight can lead to the danger of hitting a reef or sinking. Now that this kind of secret has been discovered among the crew members, the Association has declared that it will withdraw from the insurance to avoid future disputes. All documents are declared invalid.</p>
<p>Navigation Bureau Thoroughly Investigated and Awaited Punishment: The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was suspicious after receiving a non-official report the day before yesterday. It was believed that the ship owner Ouyang Tai was honest and capable and would never commit the illegal act of colluding to blow up the ship. Later, after the wife of the first mate Sheng Fuchen brought Sheng's personal letter to report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau, they sent someone to the Jianghai Customs to investigate yesterday. The ship was indeed detained by the Sanduao Customs. Therefore, the Maritime Affairs Bureau is now investigating the truth in detail to impose punishment.</p>

At that time, its position was about 20 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude, right in the middle of southern Taiwan and northern Luzon, and was moving northwest-west.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Ministry of Railways Replies to the Chamber of Commerce Explaining That State Coal Is Responsible for Transportation <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Coal Industry Association stating that both roads were handling responsible transportation, increasing the price of coal per catty, and merchants and people could not bear the burden. They immediately submitted it to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that it be transferred to maintain the old price and charge. The original text was published in various newspapers. It is now known that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, saying: "The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has read the telegram. All goods transported by railway are subject to responsible transportation fees. This is an established method of the Ministry that has been implemented for a long time. Coal catty cannot be unique, and when coal catty transportation was not handled responsibly, coal merchants had to hire their own escorts, and their wages and fares were not small. The theft and shortage of coal catty could still not be avoided. These losses were borne by the coal merchants. In addition, there may be various improper expenses, and the amount is far more than the ordinary responsible fee of 10%. Now that the railway is responsible for transportation, coal catty can be exempted from the above-mentioned various expenses, and in case of loss, the railway will compensate in full. Although coal merchants pay an additional 10% of the ordinary responsible fee, what they save is more than double. From the perspective of the railway itself, the reduction of coal catty freight rates over the years has already lost the transportation cost, but in order to maintain state coal, it is tolerated and implemented. Now, in order to ensure the safety and cost savings of state coal transportation, the implementation of responsible transportation increases anti-theft equipment, adds escort police, and prepares funds to compensate for losses. The additional 10% ordinary responsible fee is used to slightly compensate. The Coal Industry Association pointed out that it is a disguised price increase, which is ignorant of the gains and losses. The request to charge the old price for state coal truck transportation should not be discussed. I hope you will reply to the Coal Industry Association and inform all coal merchants. This is a special reply, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu (seal)"</p>

<p>Revised Election of Directors and Supervisors: The Ministry of Internal Affairs instructed the Association, saying: "According to the investigation, the Ministry previously stipulated in the first half of Article 4 of the Regulations on the Administration of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China (the Association shall have directors and supervisors, each with a certain number of people, who shall be elected from the representatives of the national members by the National Congress of Members) and Article 24, paragraph 2 of the Implementing Rules (the aforementioned directors shall be elected from the members by the National Congress of Members); Article 26, paragraph 2 of the same Implementing Rules also has the same provisions. By carefully examining the content of the articles, the scope of the qualifications for the election of directors and supervisors is different, and there is no ambiguity in application. The National Congress of Members of the Association is about to be convened, and it should be clearly interpreted as soon as possible to follow. Moreover, considering that the duties of the directors and supervisors of the Association are heavy, it is appropriate to widely solicit talents for the candidates in order to benefit the Association. It seems inappropriate to limit it to the representatives of the members and deprive the right of the majority of the members to be elected. The Executive Yuan has been requested to review and approve that the qualifications for the election of the directors and supervisors of the Association in this session shall still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Implementing Rules. At the same time, in order to strive for consistency in the content of the regulations, the Legislative Yuan is also requested to consider revising the Administration Regulations for application in the volume. Hereby, the Executive Yuan instructed in the 177th meeting of the court, and the resolution (passed), and has been consulted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and amendment of the regulations. This is hereby instructed to be followed, and the qualifications for the election of the directors and supervisors of the Association in this session shall still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Implementing Rules. This is a very important instruction."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Brief Record of the Disaster in Longquan, Zhejiang Province <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association recently received a telegram from Qian Desheng, Shao Zegui, and hundreds of other representatives of the disaster victims in Changan Town, Longquan, Zhejiang, saying that Changan Town, Longquan, has suffered from severe drought for three months in June, July, and August this year. The fields are cracked, and the rice is scorched. The farmers are drawing water day and night and are very anxious. On September 2, they suddenly suffered a bandit disaster. More than 5,000 people attacked the territory, kidnapped and looted, and searched every household. They were tied up and carried away day and night. The people fled and hid in the thickets. The dead are gone. The rich have emptied their pockets, and the poor have exhausted every drop, so that all the shops in the town are closed, and the smoke is cut off. Forty to fifty percent of them cannot make a fire. Now, although the bandits have retreated to the Fujian border, Changan is only forty miles away from the Fujian border. People are panicking, and they move several times a night. It is especially difficult to find food. Natural and man-made disasters are coming together, which is an unprecedented tragedy. Before and after Changan Town, the surrounding towns and villages such as Xiaomei and Chatian in Nanxiang, Tangshang and Xitou in Xixiang have also suffered the same disasters. Millions of people are clamoring and waiting to be fed urgently. They are crying and begging for rescue and relief to comfort the survivors. According to the records, the disaster in Zhejiang Province is extremely tragic, and other provinces are also unavoidable. The last surprising news from astronomers was that the typhoon also had a tendency to hit Shanghai. Fortunately, the wind changed direction and was exempted. It is enough to show that God loves the people of Shanghai, because there are always philanthropists in Shanghai, who have the heart to help people and benefit things, or design fundraising, generously donate, and work together to provide relief and eliminate disasters. The reason is that all those who have the idea of disaster relief will be blessed by God. The truth is not bad. I hope that enthusiastic colleagues will quickly show compassion, use kindness to eliminate fierceness, and provide as much assistance as possible to the compatriots in the disaster-stricken provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei, so as to avoid the arrival of a disaster. The opportunity must not be lost. If everyone has a kind thought, it will surely spread peace to the earth.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Begging for Relief in Wangdian District, Jiaxing <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Silkworm Failure and Rice and Bean Shortage, People Are Not Living</p>
<p>There are Several Cases of Robbing Rice and Sitting Down to Eat, Which Is Quite Worrying</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province suffered from severe drought this year, and the rivers, fields, and crops are dry everywhere. Wangdian Town in Jiaxing County along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road is particularly affected. Special letters have been sent to various places to beg for relief. The disaster situation, losses, and disturbances caused by the disaster in the district are recorded as follows to show the urgency of waiting for relief.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation and Losses This Year: The total area of Wangdian District is 217,593 mu, 147,000 mu of which are fields, and 63,000 mu of which are land. Only 46,200 mu were planted, and few of them grew. According to accurate statistics, only 14,000 stone of rice can be harvested, and 219,800 stone were lost due to drought. The 63,000 mu of land are all mulberry gardens. The failure of silkworms is needless to say. The soybeans planted in the middle of the mulberry gardens are difficult to grow due to the long drought. It is estimated that only 3,000 stone can be harvested, and 23,000 stone were lost. The loss of only rice and beans is more than 1,751,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Process of Disturbances Caused by the Disaster: The large-scale rice grabbing on July 22 originated in Wangdian. By July 23, ruffians mixed in, and the momentum became even more turbulent. The entire town lost more than 600 stone of rice and beans. Although the police and security teams tried their best to suppress it, the government distributed accumulated grains, and local public groups presided over porridge to quell the turmoil, but it was like a drop in the bucket and difficult to be universal and lasting. Therefore, from July 25 to August 8, although the town appeared peaceful, in the ten days or so, according to the survey in the countryside, there were 40 cases of rice grabbing and sitting down to eat. Recently, even half of the savings are difficult to escape. There have been many reports of grabbing clothes and silver dollars. On July 25, on the way from this district to Xiashi, the crowd crowded on the railway for rice, and the opening of the district train was blocked. This phenomenon has never been seen in western Zhejiang, and it can also be seen that it is serious now.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Suzhou High Court Orders All Courts to Establish Appointed Defense Attorneys <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Ten Provisional Regulations Specified</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court sent Instruction No. 2380 to all Lawyers' Associations, stating: "Received Instruction No. 11892 from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. This court submitted a document proposing provisional regulations for the appointment of permanent public defenders by this court, requesting review and instructions. The document stated: (The document and regulations have been reviewed. Public defenders are appointed by the state, provided with a fixed salary, and are a type of public office dedicated to criminal defense, not concurrently held by lawyers. This is evident from foreign legal precedents and Article 8 of the Implementing Regulations of our country's Criminal Procedure Law. The original proposed regulations are no different from the previous practice of courts contracting with lawyers for appointment. They do not fully comply with the system of public defenders. The original proposed regulations should be changed to (Appointed Defense Attorneys). There are also points in the article on (Appointed Defense Attorneys) that should be revised, and the Ministry has made appropriate revisions and will issue a separate copy. You are to refer to this and prepare a corrected copy for submission to the Ministry for record. The regulations are retained. This is the order, etc.) In view of this, this court previously intended to appoint lawyers Liu Zutang, Tao Jianshan, Xu Zhu, and Liang Wei as permanent public defenders, which should now be changed to (Appointed Defense Attorneys). It is imperative to issue the revised regulations, instructing you to take note and forward them to the Lawyers' Association for compliance. This is the order. Enclosed is a copy of the Provisional Regulations for Appointed Defense Attorneys. (Article 1) For the sake of expediting criminal cases, this court appoints four lawyers to serve as designated defense counsel in cases where defense counsel is required by law. (Article 2) The aforementioned defense counsel shall be appointed by this court from among lawyers practicing in the area under its jurisdiction. (Article 3) The term of appointment for appointed defense counsel shall be six months, and a new appointment shall be made upon expiration. (Article 4) After the expiration of the term of appointment for appointed defense counsel, they must continue their duties until a successor takes over. (Article 5) Appointed defense counsel shall not be absent arbitrarily from scheduled hearings of cases for which they have been appointed. If they are unable to attend court on time due to a genuine reason, they shall first notify this court and entrust another lawyer to act as defense counsel. (Article 6) Appointed defense counsel shall not appoint another defense counsel for cases for which they have already been designated. (Article 7) Serving as appointed defense counsel is an obligation, but each lawyer may be given a monthly allowance of forty yuan, half of which shall be paid by this court, and the remainder shall be borne by the respective Lawyers' Associations. (Article 8) This court shall provide a separate office for appointed defense counsel to facilitate their work. (Article 9) If appointed defense counsel perform their duties diligently or achieve particularly excellent results during their term, the presiding judge of each court may report to the President of this court for appropriate rewards. Those who violate their duties shall be disciplined by the court president in accordance with the disciplinary procedures stipulated in the Lawyers' Regulations. (Article 10) These regulations shall take effect from the date of approval by the Ministry."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Memorial Service for Ms. Wu Yongmei <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The remains of Wu Yongmei, a female student at the National Jinan University who was crushed to death, are still temporarily placed in the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Jiangxi Alumni Association of the university and all the students, deeply saddened by Ms. Wu's cautious and intelligent nature, love of learning, early loss of parents, and suffering of hardship, feeling sympathy for her solitary life, held a memorial service to express their admiration. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The memorial service was held in the Zhiyuan Hall of the university. A banner was hung above the entrance, reading "Memorial Service for the Late Ms. Wu Yongmei." Registration desks for guests and students were set up on both sides. Inside the hall, the national flag and the image of Ms. Wu were hung in the center, surrounded by wreaths and white cloth elegiac couplets. Over a thousand guests and students attended, all with solemn and sorrowful expressions. The university authorities also announced a one-hour suspension of classes to express their condolences. After the opening of the meeting, Shen Pengfei, the chief officiant, gave a report, stating that Ms. Wu was excellent in character and academics at the university, humble and amiable, and had extraordinary aspirations, always thinking of contributing to the country and society. It was unexpected that such an accident would occur, and she would die with hatred, truly a loss of talent for the country and a model for the students. Then, Meng Shouchun, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Zhang Yaoxiang, the Director of the Department of Education, and representatives of the Jiangxi Alumni Association of Jiaotong University successively spoke.</p>
<p>Ms. Wu's Life: Reported by Ms. Li Xiyong, stating that Ms. Wu was born in November of the second year of Xuantong. When she was four years old, her mother passed away, and she went to live with her grandmother. The following year, she was raised by her stepmother, Ms. Kong, who loved her as if she were her own daughter. She entered elementary school at the age of twelve and did not leave until she graduated from high school. She was diligent and cautious in her studies, and never spoke harshly to others. She always excelled in exams and was highly praised by teachers and friends. Unexpectedly, Ms. Wu lost her father at the age of sixteen and, as an orphan, raised her younger siblings, fulfilling her responsibilities as a child. In the summer of the 21st year, her stepmother arranged a marriage with the Min family. When Ms. Wu heard the news, the red thread had already been tied. Ms. Wu, known for her filial piety, did not dare to disobey her mother's wishes, but because the matter concerned her entire life, she appealed to her father's friend, Mr. Ping, to cancel the engagement. Although she achieved her wish, a rift had already formed between mother and daughter. In the summer of the previous year, she was admitted to Jinan University, majoring in education. She studied diligently but was often unhappy. Ms. Wu had experienced great changes and suffered hardships in her life. This summer, she returned to sweep her father's tomb, and before a month had passed, she was tragically devoured by a "city tiger". If her spirit is aware, she will forever hold resentment in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Aftermath: According to Mr. Cai Cixue, a representative of the Wu case support association, the support association decided to assist Ms. Wu's family in filing a lawsuit with the court, build a memorial碑 at the scene of the accident, and raise funds for a memorial educational essay award to commemorate her memory permanently and comfort her soul. Her nephew, Zhenheng, and niece, Zhenxian, are currently studying at the Wusong Merchant Marine School, and her cousin, Ping Zuren, works at Jiaoda University. They all expressed great grief and firmly requested that the court severely punish the murderer and provide preferential treatment to the deceased. As for Ms. Wu's remains, they will be transported back to her hometown for burial after the conclusion of the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Recently, there was a report that the approved Shanghai local budget had an order to reduce the surtax on car donations. The reporter specially visited the financial authorities to inquire about the collection of this surtax. They were answered that the name of this surtax is "Surtax on Interconnected Cars in Five Provinces and Cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai." It is based on Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Interconnected Cars in Five Provinces and Cities, which stipulates that 10% of the car donation should be collected and submitted to the National Economic Commission and the Five Provinces and Cities Transportation Commission jointly organized by the five provinces and cities, for the purpose of handling all equipment on the public roads of the five provinces. Therefore, the surtax is a collection in lieu and not an ordinary city revenue. Whether it will be reduced in the future will depend on the decision of the National Economic Commission and the five provinces and cities. Before the decision to reduce it is made, the city will continue to collect it as usual.</p>

<p>Representatives Sent to Shanghai to Raise Relief Funds</p>
<p>Jiangpu County faces the capital across the water. The whole territory is divided into five districts, covering more than 300,000 mu of land, of which 80-90% are mountainous land and only 10-20% are enclosed fields. The rural economy has not yet recovered from the severe flooding of the year before last. This year's severe drought has turned into a scene of misery everywhere. The county has always been known as a poor and sick township, and the poor harvest this year is normal. In addition, the natural environment is not as good as that of the five southern counties. The people of the whole county, in addition to working hard to cultivate self-sufficiency, have no other side industries to adjust. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of spring, there has been little rainfall, and locusts have wreaked havoc. Fortunately, they were put out early to avoid disaster. Since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain, the land has cracked, and the seedlings have withered. The scene is desolate, as if one has climbed to barren land. Cries are everywhere, and there is no way to seek help. Although the various charitable organizations in the county have organized a famine relief association to carry out emergency relief, the local economy is strained, and they are exhausted. Moreover, as the cold winter is approaching, the famine relief work is urgent. Therefore, they have sent a representative, Mr. Lin Chunting, to Shanghai to appeal for help. It is reported that Mr. Lin arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is now contacting the various charitable organizations separately.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Terrible Tragedy at Renji Hospital <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Xiong Guohua Assassinated in His Hospital Bed</p>
<p>Police Detective and Patrolman Also Killed Tragically</p>
<p>丨The Murderer Escaped, The Situation is Serious丨</p>
<p>At 11:35 PM on the 16th of this month, an assassination occurred in Room 34 of the Shenji Qianji Hotel, No. 37 Huajin Lane, Simalu Road. The victim was named Xiong Guohua, said to be from Taizhou, 34 years old. At the time, it was reported that his injuries were not serious, so after being sent to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road for treatment, he gradually recovered. The details have been reported in this newspaper. However, yesterday afternoon, he was shot and killed in the hospital, and a detective and a patrolman were also killed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Xiong Guohua Recovering Well On the evening of the 16th of this month, Xiong Guohua was in Room 34 of the Qianji Hotel when two bandits tricked him into opening the door and shot him. He fell to the ground unconscious. The hotel accountant immediately reported to the police, who immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. Xiong Guohua was sent to Renji Hospital on Shandong Road for treatment. He was sent to Bed No. 18 in Ward No. 145 on the first floor. After examination by the doctor, it was found that he had three injuries, one in the mouth, one at the root of the neck, and one in the right chest. However, none were serious. After the bullets were removed and he was carefully treated, his injuries gradually recovered, and he would soon be discharged from the hospital. However, at that time, the police, because the criminals in this case had not been caught, and Xiong's whereabouts were also suspicious, specially assigned three detectives to take turns guarding the hospital every day to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Drawing Guns Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM,</p>
<p>Pretending to Visit Renji Hospital opened its doors because it was the designated visiting time. Visitors entered one after another. However, in order to prevent irrelevant people from entering, the hospital issued a visitor's pass. However, at about 3:40 PM, four more men came, two wearing Zhongshan suits, one wearing a black long gown, and one wearing a blue cloth long gown, about 20 or 30 years old. They went to the hospital and broke in. At that time, the person checking the passes at the door of the accounting room asked them for passes. The four men ignored him and went straight in. The pass checker stopped them because they violated the regulations. While they were arguing, the four men each pulled out a gun and showed it to the pass checker, saying, "This is the ticket." Then, two men escorted him back into the accounting room and guarded the staff in the telephone room, preventing them from moving. At the same time, they blocked the telephone and cut off communication.</p>
<p>Hit by Two Bullets At this time, two men went</p>
<p>Died Instantly straight to Ward No. 145 on the first floor and broke into the room. Xiong Guohua was still lying in bed at Bed No. 28. Suddenly, he saw someone entering and was about to ask a question when the two men pulled out guns and each fired a shot at him, both in the head and brain. Xiong was caught off guard and was unable to resist because he had just recovered from his injuries. He was killed without resistance. Blood and brains splattered all over the bed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two men turned around and fled. At that time, the patients in the next room suddenly heard gunshots and were frightened. The other staff members were unable to capture them, so they had to let them run down the stone stairs and escape.</p>
<p>Fan Yongquan At this time, Fan Yongquan, No. 253 detective</p>
<p>Died Tragically from the Laozao Police Station, Qingjiang, who was responsible for monitoring Xiong Guohua, happened to be sitting idly in the reception room downstairs. Suddenly, he heard gunshots from Ward No. 145 and knew something was wrong. He quickly pulled out his pistol and walked out of the reception room. But at this time, the two murderers had already run to the side of the small garden downstairs and met up with the two men in the accounting room. Fan thought they were escaping from upstairs, so he didn't suspect anything and walked towards the men. However, his weapon had already been seen by them. The holder was unintentional, but the viewer was intentional. They thought that Fan had seen through their actions, so they pointed their guns at Fan and shouted for him to stop and raise his hands. Fan was caught off guard and unable to resist, so he had to raise his hands. However, in a flash, heartless bullets were fired like a string of beads, hitting Fan in the chest. He fell to the ground in response, blood gushing out, and died instantly.</p>
<p>A Patrolman But the disaster unexpectedly</p>
<p>Died Accidentally Happened. While Detective Fan was being killed and the murderers had not yet escaped from the hospital, a fight broke out at the French Concession Police Station. The injured person was named Yang Yulin, but his injuries were very minor, so he ordered Patrolman No. 721 to escort him to Renji Hospital for treatment. After entering the door, Yang Yulin walked alone past the small garden to the clinic for treatment, with the French Concession patrolman following behind, about ten yards away. The murderers saw him and thought he was there to arrest them, so they rushed forward and shouted at the French Concession patrolman to stop. The French Concession patrolman No. 721 knew that the situation was not good. Moreover, he was empty-handed and unable to resist, so he quickly turned around to escape. However, the four murderers fired three shots from behind, all hitting him, penetrating his chest. He also fell to the side of the small garden and died. After killing three people, the four murderers were like entering a no-man's land. They calmly escaped from the hospital and fled in different directions. When the police received the report and rushed a full team of Chinese and Western armed detectives to pursue them, they had long since disappeared. They quickly notified the French Concession Police Station to first send the body of Chinese patrolman No. 721 to the coroner's office. In the evening, they continued to send the bodies of Fan and Xiong to the coroner's office to await the court's examination this morning. They also notified the city's police agencies to provide assistance in arresting the escaped murderers.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Wu Hua Bank Depositors File Lawsuit <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Managers Fan Shaoliang, Wang Jian'e, and Eight Others Named as Defendants</p>
<p>Depositors List Three Major Counts of Fraud and Breach of Trust, Detailing Events Before and After</p>
<p>丨Plaintiffs and Others Absent From Yesterday's Trial丨</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank established a Shanghai branch at No. 130 Ningbo Road in the Shanghai International Settlement around October of last year. By June of this year, the branch had opened a sub-branch at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession's Eight Immortals Bridge area. Unexpectedly, on August 21, both the branch and sub-branch suddenly went bankrupt simultaneously. Due to clearing issues, the head office and the branch argued, each hiring lawyers to publish accusations in newspapers, engaging in heated debates. Currently, ten creditors holding savings and current account deposits in the branch and sub-branch – Chu Longgen, Chen Xianji, Luo Lihua (female), Shi Pengfei, Du Zhiji, Shi Bilong, Shen Peng, Zhou Delin, Wang Fulin, Pan Yuanji, and others – have jointly retained four lawyers, Zhang Shijie, Lou Yunmei, Xu Jie, and Mao Fengwu, to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court. They accuse Fan Shaoliang and Ye Haitian, deputy managers of the Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank Shanghai Branch, Wang Jian'e and Wu Yousan, deputy managers of the Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch, as well as Xie Shunzhi, Tang Songshan, Tang Shoumin, and Chen Bingqian, managers and advisors of the branch, of fraud and breach of trust, requesting legal judgment and sentencing.</p>
<p>The substance of the complaint states: "Regarding the matter of fraud and breach of trust, requesting legal judgment and sentencing, the plaintiffs are depositors of the now-bankrupt Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank Shanghai Branch and Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch. The defendants are the business operators of the branch and sub-branch. According to regulations, the establishment of bank branches must be approved by the Ministry of Finance before commencing operations. The Wu Hua branch and sub-branch in Shanghai were established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the branch and sub-branch did not meet the substantive requirements for establishment, and the act of accepting cash deposits was undoubtedly an illegal act. Even if they claim to have registered with a foreign government, conducting business within Chinese territory without legal approval should not qualify them as legal entities. All actors should bear their responsibilities. The defendants are all important officers of the Wu Hua branch and sub-branch. Having discovered illegal activities, the plaintiffs are entitled to file a complaint against them. The facts of defrauding money and breaching trust are described below: (1) The Wu Hua Bank Shanghai Branch was established in October of last year at No. 130 Ningbo Road. By late June of this year, the Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch was established at Nos. 126 to 168 Avenue Dubail. According to recent reports about the inside story of the bank, it was already struggling to support itself.</p>
<p>Expanding Empty Ventures to Absorb Cash to Maintain Lavish Decoration, Further Utilizing Advertising Propaganda: Requiring Only Fifty Silver Dollars for Deposit, Without Guarantee, to Receive a Checkbook for Use in Society, Truly Opening Up an Unprecedented Special Case in Shanghai's Banking Industry. Furthermore, they cleverly established names such as "Five-Year Savings Plan," "Ten-Year Savings Plan," and "New Life Savings," using attractive interest rates in advertisements as bait. Unexpectedly, the branch went bankrupt in less than a year, and the sub-branch in only two months, simultaneously. The plaintiffs' trusted Five-Year Plan and Ten-Year Plan funds had already been paid monthly, but the defendants violated the five-year and ten-year missions, suddenly ceasing operations, causing the depositors' paid amounts to become the illegal property of the defendants or some of them. At the same time, depositors suffered damages, indicating that the initial (see advertisements in various newspapers on June 21 of this year when the bank opened) and the Five-Year and Ten-Year Plan and other high-interest savings regulations were all tools to absorb cash and obtain illegal profits. The defendants committed the crime of breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Code. (2) The Wu Hua Bank Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch went bankrupt on August 21 of this year.</p>
<p>The Night Before, the Defendants Hired Two Automobiles to Secretly Transport the Savings of the Plaintiffs, Namely the Depositors, and Valuables Overnight to North Sichuan Road to Hide Them (see reports in various newspapers). After being discovered, a bookkeeper named Qu was unable to escape and was arrested by the French police and released on bail. It is verifiable. According to a statement published by Wang Jian'e, the manager of the defendant bank, in the newspaper on the 25th of this month, the sub-branch received a total of over 80,000 silver dollars in deposits, showing that the defendants had premeditated an organized fraud. As soon as they absorbed the deposits, they moved them to their private residences for enjoyment, which is very clear. The plaintiffs mistakenly believed in their five-year and ten-year long-term plans, sparing no effort to scrape together money from their hard work and handing it all over. Who knew that their advertisements and regulations were all fraudulent tricks? The defendants committed the crime of fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. (3) According to Article 2 of the Savings Bank Law promulgated and implemented by the National Government on July 4, 1934, savings banks may not be established without the approval of the Ministry of Finance. Ordinary banks</p>
<p>Simultaneously Operating Savings Bank Business Must Collect Paid-Up Capital of at Least One Million National Currency. The bank organized by the defendants was not approved by the Ministry of Finance, and its capital, including the branch and sub-branch, did not reach 500,000 silver dollars (as reported in various newspapers on the 25th of this month). Therefore, it fundamentally could not simultaneously operate a savings business. Even if the law was promulgated and implemented on July 4 of this year, their previous actions would not be subject to sanctions. However, after the law was promulgated and implemented, they should no longer accept deposits from the plaintiffs. This is their violation of Article 2 of the law, which should be subject to the penalties of Article 16, Paragraph 1, also. Furthermore, Article 7 of the law lists regulations for the use of funds. According to a statement by Wang Jian'e, manager of the Wu Hua Bank Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch, published in the newspaper on the 25th of this month, the sub-branch's total deposit income was over 80,000 silver dollars, most of which was remitted to the branch. This is their violation of the use of funds, which, according to Articles 7 and 9 of the law, should be subject to the penalties of Article 16 of the same law, also. In summary, the defendants are all managers,</p>
<p>Important Officers of the Wu Hua Industrial Trust Bank Shanghai Branch and Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch. Based on the advertisements with text and pictures displayed by the Eight Immortals Bridge Sub-branch beforehand, deceiving the public, and the means of deliberately offering high interest rates to lure deposits, and the earlier actions of moving assets and documents before closing down and fleeing, it is reliable evidence that it was an organized fraud. Therefore, a complaint is specially filed in accordance with the law, begging for investigation, summoning the defendants for interrogation to clarify the facts, and imposing criminal penalties and fines according to law." The court verified the complaint and summoned the plaintiffs yesterday. The plaintiffs all arrived with their lawyers, but none of the defendants arrived. Lawyers arrived on their behalf. Presiding Judge Zhang Pengzu and Clerk Zheng Rong opened the second court for trial. First, the plaintiffs reported the amount of deposits lost, with the largest being 3,000 silver dollars and the smallest being 20 silver dollars. They also stated that the defendants opened the bank, using five-year and ten-year plans to absorb deposits and savings, and went bankrupt without reason in less than three months, which was indeed a fraudulent act. They requested the recovery of the lost deposits and savings, and requested punishment to deter future offenders. Then, Hua Maosheng, the defending lawyer for the first and second defendants, Fan Shaoliang and Ye Haitian, stated, "My clients saw the notice of today's hearing in the newspaper, but the summons</p>
<p>Was Delivered After Multiple Transfers and Has Not Yet Been Received, So They Did Not Appear. However, the Wu Hua Bank Branch is located at No. 130 Ningbo Road in the British Concession. Based on the issue of jurisdiction, we request a ruling and determination at the next hearing." The judge then instructed the plaintiffs that the addresses of the defendants on the complaint were provided by accountant Wang Sisui. Today, a copy of the complaint will be delivered in court, and a copy will be issued to each defendant's lawyer. Zheng Wenkai, the defending lawyer for the third defendant, Wang Jian'e, stated, "My client went to Nanjing on business and could not appear. My lawyer was appointed by his family. The defendant himself can appear at the next hearing." Ma Chang, representing the fourth defendant, Wu Yousan, stated, "My client is ill and can appear at the next hearing." Yuan Xingyun, representing the fifth, sixth, and seventh defendants, Xie Shunzhi, Tang Songshan, and Tang Shoumin, stated, "Tang Shoumin is absent due to illness. The others did not appear because they did not receive the summons." Yang Guoshu, representing the eighth defendant, Chen Bingqian, stated, "My client is 70 years old and is currently recuperating in Moganshan. The summons has been sent to him and he can appear at the next hearing." Finally, the plaintiffs' representing lawyers Zhang Shijie, Lou Yunmei, and Xu Jie supplemented their opinions and submitted a copy of the Ministry of Finance's disapproval. The court reviewed the statements and instructed that a date be set for another summons, and then adjourned.</p>
<p>The police rushed to the scene, and both sides exchanged gunfire. The Western police fired a total of six shots, and the two Chinese police fired a total of six shots. The bandits fired back continuously like machine guns. As a result of the battle, the Western police suffered leg injuries in one place each and fell to the ground in pain. Zhang Guixiang and Zhou Caixiang, two of the bandits, were shot in the legs. Zhang fell to the ground on the spot and was captured. Zhou was very fierce and fled despite his injuries. The other two bandits also disappeared during the chaos. At this time, the Jing'an Temple police station had received a report, and the police chief immediately dispatched all Chinese and Western detectives, armed, to conduct a siege. While passing by Avenue Kénéral Liéautey, Zhou was getting into a rickshaw to escape, and was intercepted by the detectives. A pistol and seven bullets were found on his person, and he was brought back to the police station along with Zhang. The injured Western police were sent to Hong'en Hospital for treatment. The two bandits confessed at the police station that there were a total of four of them. The ringleader had ordered them to go to the Cathay Hotel on Avenue Joffre. Upon arriving there, the ringleader sent them to Dapu Bridge in the French Concession, where someone handed them three pistols and instructed them to accept them immediately. The firearms were to be transported back to Jiangbei, and if they encountered interrogation on the way, they could open fire and resist arrest. They stated that they had obtained the pistols on the orders of the ringleader and opened fire because they were being investigated by the patrol police. The police station still needs to investigate whether these confessions are false. However, the two bandits are seriously injured and have been sent to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. Once they recover, they will be transferred to the First Special District Court for trial.</p>

<p>All Doubts Completely Resolved</p>
<p>Regarding the incident in which the wife of American citizen Triskell was injured on the road early Sunday morning, the woman regained her memory yesterday. According to her, she took a car home that day, and upon getting out of the car, realized that she had forgotten the key somewhere and could not open the door. But the car had already gone far away. Therefore, she hired a rickshaw to go to a friend's house to spend the night. The rickshaw was traveling along Route Tenant de la Tour, which was under repair at the time. The rickshaw puller was careless and lost his footing, causing the rickshaw to overturn. Her head hit the gravel, causing serious injuries and a long period of unconsciousness. Thus, the doubts in this case are completely resolved.</p>

<p>Fingerprints Reveal Prostitute as Thief</p>
<p>Acts Illegally Out of Urgent Need</p>
<p>Hong Naizhen, a dancer from Changzhou at the Sanmin Palace Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road, in her early twenties, lived with a Westerner at No. 214 Kunshan Road. The Westerner worked on a ship and was therefore not often at home. Chen Qiao'lai (21 years old), a small sister of Hong's from Anhui, worked as a prostitute at No. 4 Weichang Lane on East/West Seward Road. Since she had nothing to do during the day, she helped Hong with chores. Since one occupation involved embracing and the other involved selling flesh, there was no conflict. On the evening of the 24th of this month, Hong and Lu went out together to make a living. When Hong returned after dancing, she found the door wide open and the boxes and chests inside in disarray. Knowing that something had happened, she immediately checked and found that several pieces of gold jewelry and 50 silver dollars were missing. Other items were untouched. Hong suspected that only Chen knew where she hid the gold jewelry and silver dollars, so she immediately reported it to the Hongkou police station. Detectives Yang Xichen and Gu Changqia went to arrest Chen, but Chen vehemently denied it. Subsequently, the detectives found a fingerprint on the box. After comparing it with Chen's fingerprint, it was a complete match. Chen knew she could not deny it, and confessed that she had hidden some of the stolen goods under the pillow of her bed at No. 4 Weichang Lane. She also admitted that her lover, Wu Jinbao from Jiangbei, had taken 20 silver dollars. The detectives then arrested Wu, seized the original stolen 19.8 silver dollars, and seized the gold jewelry from under Chen's pillow. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu charged Chen with Article 237 of the Criminal Code and Wu with Article 376. When questioned, Chen Qiao'lai confessed that she had done this because she urgently needed cash. Wu confessed that Chen had given him the 20 dollars. Presiding Judge Deng Baosun reviewed the confession and sentenced Chen to two months of imprisonment and Wu to 20 days of detention as a warning.</p>

<p>The Reason is That the Engagement Used the Concubine's Name</p>
<p>Out of Resentment, Zhao Lu's did This Illegal Act</p>
<p>Wen, the legal wife of Zhao Zengfu, the owner of the Zhao He Xing fruit store in Xinjie, Minhang Town in the southwest of this county, passed away many years ago, leaving behind a son named Ziwen (currently 21 years old), who was working as a typesetter in the Lisheng Chang Printing Office in Shengze. In the 11th year of the Republic (1922), Zhao Zengfu, lacking someone to care for the family, remarried Lu of this town as his stepmother through matchmaking. At that time, Ziwen was only nine years old, and Lu raised him, treating him with exceptional affection, as if he were her own child. However, Zhao Zengfu was fond of women, so in the 16th year of the Republic (1927), he became involved with a woman. Soon after, he had an affair with Yang A'er, a young woman from this town. He favored the new and abandoned the old, and also neglected Lu. Therefore, Lu often argued with Zhao Zengfu, and they were incompatible. Before long, Zhao became involved with a woman named Yan. Because he could not stand Lu's harassment, he took money and left home in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and lived with Yan at No. 11 Sanjiaodi, Xujiahui. Zhao Zengfu, because his son had grown up, asked a matchmaker to arrange a marriage for Ziwen with a woman named Zheng Wanping from Shengze. They chose to get married on the 19th of this month and sent out invitations to relatives and friends in advance. However, Lu felt that she had raised Ziwen for many years, and the invitations were printed with the name of a concubine, so out of resentment, she invited Li Zhongda, Jin Xiang, and others to Shanghai and opened Room 21 at the Central Hotel at Xiaodongmen. She also invited Yao Jinyuan, a shareholder of the Xieshun Restaurant in Yuhangqiao, and others, and at 8:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month, hired a car to go to Zhao Zengfu's house in Sanjiaodi, Xujiahui, and forcibly dragged Zhao Ziwen into the car and hid him in Room 21 of the Central Hotel. Later, they moved him to Room 12 and forced Ziwen to write a letter to his father, Zhao Zengfu, telling him to come to the Central Hotel for negotiations. If Zhao Zengfu was afraid and did not come, then Ziwen would have to issue an IOU for 700 yuan to repay Lu's debts. However, Zhao Zengfu was working as an accountant at the Jinghua Leather Industrial Cooperative in the French Concession. The letter written by Ziwen was sent to the cooperative by Jin Xiang, dispatched by Lu. Because Zhao was out, a colleague at the cooperative sent the letter to Zhao's elder brother, Zhao Zengxiang, who opened the letter and was shocked. He believed that Lu's actions were akin to kidnapping, so he rushed to the hotel to contact them. However, Lu and others had already moved elsewhere. Zhao Zengxiang was extremely anxious, fearing that his nephew Ziwen would suffer a tragic accident. He immediately asked lawyer Pan Zhensheng to write a letter to the Second Branch of the First District, requesting the police to rush to the scene. As a result, Ziwen was rescued in Room 12, and Lu, Jin Xiang, Li Zhongda, and Li's mother, Pei, were arrested on the spot. Later, Yao Jinyuan, Xu Shunsheng, and others were also arrested and sent to the Third Section, and then transferred to the District Court. Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu filed a public prosecution after questioning them clearly. Except for those who were not related to the case who were released on bail, Lu, Li Zhongda, Yao Jinyuan, and other men and women were publicly prosecuted for the crime of Article 316 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the Third Court for trial. The plaintiff Zhao Zengfu retained lawyer Pan Zhensheng to appear in court and requested an incidental private prosecution, requesting compensation for all losses. After the judge took the bench, he ordered Lu, who was in custody, to be brought to court. She confessed that she was 47 years old, from Minhang, and opened the Lu Shunxing fruit store in Minhang. Her husband, Zhao Zengfu, married her in the 11th year of the Republic (1922), and they separated in the 20th year (1931). Her son Ziwen was born to the former wife and is now working in the printing industry in Shengze. On the first day of August of this year, I came to Shanghai to look for my husband Zhao Zengfu but did not find him, so I brought Ziwen to the hotel. The letter was written by Ziwen at my direction. The judge asked how many of you went to Xujiahui in a car. She answered that she, Li Zhongda, Yao Jinyuan, and three others went. Li Zhongda confessed that he was 28 years old, from Minhang, and was a distant relative of Lu's. This time, he accompanied Lu to Xujiahui in a car and brought Zhao Ziwen to the hotel. They are mother and son and this was not kidnapping. Please investigate. Yao Jinyuan confessed that he and Lu and others went to Zhao Zengfu's house in Xujiahui and took Zhao Ziwen to the hotel, which was true. However, he did not know about the letter. The plaintiff Zhao Zengfu confessed that he was involved with Lu in the 11th year of the Republic (1922) and separated from each other in the 21st year (1932). On the morning of September 9th, Lu hired a car and kidnapped my son. Their purpose was for money. Please punish them. Zhao Ziwen confessed that Lu was his stepmother three years ago. I worked in the printing industry in Shengze. On the morning of the ninth of this month, they dragged me to the hotel and ordered me to write a letter, telling my father to come for negotiations. Their intention of detaining me privately was to get money. They also forced me to write an IOU for 700 yuan, but I refused, so I did not write it. The judge asked and concluded and requested Prosecutor Tang to come to court to present his arguments once. The judge, with the case already clear, considered it concluded. Lawyer Pan rose and said that the plaintiff's incidental private prosecution requested compensation for losses and intended to file a separate lawsuit after the criminal judgment. The judge approved, and instructed that the case would be sentenced at 2:00 p.m. on the 29th of this month. The three defendants, Lu and other men and women, were returned to custody to await instructions.</p>

<p>Approaching Hope</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Compatriots Association, ordered by the Municipal Social Bureau to mediate the dispute between the Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Industry Association and the Yin County Codonopsis pilosula (Xiang Bei) Marketing Cooperative, specially convened representatives from all parties yesterday in the main hall of the association for goodwill mediation. The attendees included Tao Ran, Cen Zhiliang, Yuan Pinzhang, Niu Hegao, Cen Binghuang, Zhuang Meitang, Mei Dewen, representatives of the National Medicine Industry, Xu Youheng, Zhou Weixing, Cui Fuqing, representatives of the Cooperative, Weng Yangqing, Zhou Baoru, Chen Baoqing, Chen Xiangfa, representatives of the Ningbo Four Medicine Shops, and Zhang Shenzhi, the original mediator. Zhang Shenzhi was elected chairman. First, the chairman reported the process of mediating the case as ordered, and advised the representatives to adhere to the spirit of mutual dependence, abandon their previous subjective attitudes, and make mutual concessions to seek factual suitability, so that mediation would be easier to begin. Then, Tao Ran, Cen Zhiliang, Yuan Pinzhang, representatives of the National Medicine Industry, Xu Youheng, Zhou Weixing, representatives of the Cooperative, and Weng Yangqing, and other representatives of the Four Shops, successively expressed their opinions. With the difference in position, the claims were naturally different. Later, after the parties had a sincere consultation, the misunderstandings were resolved more than before. The chairman proposed that since the representatives present all held considerable positions and each had their own difficulties, could each party first discuss and retreat to the lowest limit, and then convene a meeting to discuss further. The proposal was approved by the crowd and they dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Two Assassination Case Criminals Appeal, Case Returned for Retrial <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Previously Committed Manslaughter of Jin Shoupei and Assassination of Wang Bin</p>
<p>Liu Guobao, a young man from Sichuan, and Li Decai, a man from Henan, both participated in a rebellion. In the summer of the previous year, they assassinated Cao Qingcheng, a supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau from Hubei, at the mouth of Yuancheng Lane on Route Lafayette in the French Concession, killing him. At the same time, they mistakenly killed Jin Shoupei, a native of Baoshan, due to mistaken identity. Liu and Li were chased and captured on the spot by detectives, who seized a pistol and bullets. They were brought to the police station. Later, it was found that the assassination of Wang Bin, a supervisor of the investigation team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters from Suzhou, in front of the Guosi Temple on Avenue Vilmorin, was also committed by Liu and others. Because they were political case murderers, they were transferred to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The police department filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. As a result of the trial, Liu and Li were sentenced for the crime of rebellion and each was sentenced to imprisonment. In addition, they were each sentenced to death for the crime of murder, as reported in previous newspapers. Later, because the two criminals were dissatisfied with the judgment, they filed a petition with the original trial court to appeal to the Nanjing Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and ruled that there were still doubts in the case and a detailed investigation was necessary. Therefore, the Supreme Court ruled to revoke the original trial judgment and return the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. It is now heard that the Third Branch of the High Court has received the case file and will soon open a court session to summon witnesses for investigation.</p>

The internal equipment is extremely magnificent, and the construction cost is approximately two million yuan. Prepared since the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and completed after more than three years, the building, in addition to a portion used by the bank itself, also has more than 100 offices and multiple apartment residences, which have been fully arranged. It is scheduled to move into the new building tomorrow (the 28th) and hold a grand opening ceremony at the same time, with invitations extended to prominent figures from all walks of life to attend the ceremony.

<h3 id="e142">Japanese Resident Falsifies Telephone Company Directory to Collect Advertising Fees <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Japanese Daily reported that a man named Toraji Yokono, an Osaka native currently staying at the Hinomaru Inn on Wusong Road, claiming to be an employee of the Shanghai Telephone Company, along with Yoshisada Kyuga, a resident of Fukuoka Prefecture residing at 21 Hesketh Road and currently unemployed, have been posing as representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company since early July to September 10. They claimed they were compiling a directory of Japanese subscribers and visited various Japanese residents in the city, soliciting advertising fees ranging from one hundred yuan to as little as two yuan. They promised that advertisers would receive the directory from the telephone company in the future. As of today, they have defrauded a considerable number of people. Later, a Mr. from the coffee shop research society, who had given them twenty yuan but never received the directory, went directly to the telephone company on the 25th to inquire with the comprador, Mr. Botai. Mr. Botai replied that there was no such thing. The Japanese Consulate Police, upon receiving the report, immediately arrested Yokono and Kyuga. They also discovered that the pair were falsifying the telephone company's directory at the Shuwei Printing House at 209 Haining Road. They have now been indicted on charges of fraud and obtaining property.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Marriage Dispute Arising from Opening a Butcher Shop Leads to Litigation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yao Huifang, a native woman only twenty-two years of age, residing at 20, Lane 58, Xiaoshadu Road, received a middle-school education and is quite literate. Last year, through a matchmaker, she became engaged to Zhao Jingen, who resides at 15, Lane 186, Shanhai Guan Road. They held their wedding on November 13 of the same year. The couple's relationship was quite affectionate. However, Zhao's father passed away early, leaving only a stepmother, who did not care for Zhao because he was not her biological son. She let Zhao Jingen remain unemployed and did not help him find a job. Yao, seeing that her husband's continued idleness was not a sustainable long-term plan, obtained her mother's consent and opened a butcher shop, entrusting Zhao to manage it. However, Zhao was unwilling, and a rift developed in the couple's affection. Yao was subjected to cold remarks and ridicule and was falsely accused of infidelity. On the 25th of last month, he even confined her to the room and restricted her freedom. Later, Yao's mother reported to the police, who dispatched officers to release Yao. Yao, feeling that she could no longer live with such abuse, hired lawyers Cao Lin and Gu Hanli to file a separate residence lawsuit against Zhao in the First Special District Court, requesting a monthly payment of one hundred yuan, for a period of three years, totaling three thousand six hundred yuan, and to bear the litigation costs. The First Special District Court approved the request, and Judge Yu Changzi summoned Zhao Jingen in the 14th Civil Court yesterday morning. Zhao Jingen did not appear but retained lawyer Chen Bingxing as his representative. Yao Huifang also did not appear in court but was represented by her lawyer, who stated the reasons for the lawsuit. According to lawyer Chen's defense on behalf of Zhao, Zhao is an honest and taciturn man, and his relationship with the plaintiff has always been harmonious, with no mistreatment whatsoever, as known to the neighbors. The plaintiff's assertion of mistreatment is unfounded. As for the plaintiff's claim that he refused to manage the butcher shop, the defendant is not skilled in the butcher shop business and therefore cannot manage it. Furthermore, on the 23rd of last month, the plaintiff left for Ningbo on the pretext, and the defendant did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff's mother suddenly sent someone to look for the plaintiff. The defendant told them that she had returned to Ningbo yesterday, so why were they looking for her today? There must be a reason. He then secretly searched but could not find her. She did not return until late that night. Upon learning that the plaintiff was a young woman who did not return late at night, and suspecting her actions, he questioned her. The plaintiff was evasive, and the defendant did not want to publicize the family scandal, so he did not investigate further. On the 25th, the plaintiff's father, Yao Xingquan, came to advise his daughter, asking if she still wanted to eat in the Zhao family. After three hours, she finally replied that she wanted to eat. Unexpectedly, that evening, her mother reported to the police that he was obstructing her freedom. He was ashamed and angry and used this as an outlet, which is obvious. Now, the defendant is filing a counterclaim, demanding that the plaintiff fulfill her cohabitation obligations. As for the plaintiff's request for alimony, the defendant is not wealthy and cannot afford it. The plaintiff's lawsuit should be dismissed. Judge Yu, after reviewing the report, granted permission for the trial to proceed in the absence of both the plaintiff and defendant and rescheduled the hearing for October 8. At that time, both parties must appear in person, so that the court can mediate a settlement and avoid extremes that would harm their relationship.</p>

<p>Xu Maosheng, a 44-year-old businessman from Pudong, met a fair-skinned woman from Suzhou named Wu Acai, who was just twenty years old, at the Yong'an Company rooftop garden in July last year. Xu was immediately captivated. They first met secretly in hotels, then rented a house in Zhongxing Li, Wangjia Nong, West Daxi Road, and lived together like a married couple. However, the woman was naturally promiscuous and extremely flirtatious. Before long, she turned against Xu, causing frequent quarrels. Xu realized that her nature was difficult to change and was willing to sacrifice everything. In March of this year, he hired a lawyer to certify a contract, giving her 400 yuan to end their relationship. However, not long after, the woman, knowing that Xu was weak and easily bullied, continued to pester him. Recently, Xu ignored her, causing her to harbor resentment. At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, she led a dozen hoodlums, some of whom were armed with knives and iron rods, and waited outside his door. The woman went in alone and lured Xu out. As soon as he stepped out, the hoodlums swarmed him and beat him to the ground with knives and rods. The woman, seeing that her goal had been achieved, fled with the mob. Xu's family, hearing the noise, rushed to the scene and saw two knife wounds on Xu's right arm and severe iron rod injuries to his legs and waist. They immediately took him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, they filed a report with the Sixth District Police Station, requesting an investigation and prosecution.</p>

<p>During the high tides of the past two days, which were especially severe at night with strong winds and waves, the water level in the Wusong River, commonly known as the Suzhou River, from the Xinzha Bridge to the Tanzigangkou section, reached the shore. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Liu Deming, a police officer from the Caojiadu Police Station of the Second Water Patrol Division of the Public Security Bureau, received a report from Zou Wenming, a boatman across the street, stating that his seven-year-old son, Changgen, was defecating on the stern of the boat when the tide suddenly rose and the current was very swift, causing the boat to shake. The child lost his footing and fell into the water. They immediately tried to retrieve him but could not find the body.

<p>Soviet Giant Film (Puppet) to Be Released Soon in Shanghai. Ming Company Shanghai Film Department, located at 169 Yuemingyuan Road in this city, specializes in Soviet films and has been quite reputable since its establishment. The film department recently received the film Puppet, which is a great Soviet film of 1934. The general meaning of the film is to describe a small ideal country bordering Soviet Russia, which is instigated by European politicians and soldiers who fear the power of Soviet Russia. The puppet prince of a powerful country is in charge of politics. Unexpectedly, the prince falls into the river from an airplane midway, so the barber who traveled with him is wrongly supported as king, but all power is in the hands of several politicians and soldiers. The barber is nominally a king, but in fact, he is just a puppet. The film's intention is profound, and it exposes the darkness and hypocrisy of modern politics. It is also very similar to the current situation in our Northeast, so it is necessary for all Chinese people to watch it. The film has passed censorship, but because the Shanghai Concession is unwilling to accommodate, it has been decided to open in a major theater in the Chinese territory on a regular basis. It is expected that it will cause a sensation throughout Shanghai at that time.</p>

<p>Is it Necessary to Understand Natural Science Before Studying Social Science?</p>
<p>Answer to Xu Si</p>
<p>Mr. Xu wrote a letter saying that he saw an article, stating: "Natural science occurred first, and social science was established later. Therefore, speaking about social science without a foundation in natural science is simply metaphysics... Little does he know that the theoretical foundations of social science all come from natural science. If one does not even understand the basic knowledge of natural science, how can one understand social science?" Mr. Xu, because his knowledge of natural science is very shallow, doubted whether he had the qualifications to study natural science after reading this passage. Now, let's first answer his doubts!</p>
<p>"Natural science occurred first, and social science was established later." This is true. True social science has only existed for the past few decades, while natural science sprouted more than two thousand years ago. However, the chronological order of occurrence does not prove that social science grew directly from the foundation of natural science. Of course, we cannot deny that natural science and social science have a certain relationship. Many laws in social science must be explained with the help of natural science knowledge, but social phenomena are ultimately social phenomena, fundamentally different from natural phenomena. All laws of social development and changes in natural phenomena cannot be regarded as the same thing. If we overemphasize natural science when explaining social phenomena, we will fall into error. For example, using sexuality in jurisprudence to explain social phenomena, saying that the demise of a country was due to the struggle for a woman, using geography to explain human society, saying that the strength of the ancient north was due to the cold climate, etc., are all errors in explaining social phenomena with natural phenomena. Because the real reason for the demise of a country is that its economic power is insufficient to resist foreign invaders, and the strength of the ancient northerners is due to the difficult economic situation of their nomadic life. Social phenomena have their own laws, and this point must be clearly recognized first. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Ms. Chen Xuezhi</p>
<p>More than half of the Women's National Products Year has passed. We will temporarily put aside discussing the achievements of the past six months and focus on how we should truly strive in the work of the coming months!</p>
<p>The newspapers reported the day before yesterday that the Women's National Products Year Movement Committee held a joint meeting of the Economic Affairs Committee and the Third Committee to discuss the outline of the work for the second half of the year. Although some newspapers are launching a general attack on the committee and our women, I always feel that doing national products work is better than not doing it. Frankly speaking, the work of the Women's National Products Year Movement Committee in the first half of the year can be considered diligent! It would be too much to put the responsibility for this alarming trade deficit entirely on the shoulders of our women! The trade deficit has its own complex reasons, which are truly beyond our ability to eliminate. However, we still have to work hard and must not be discouraged by this!</p>
<p>It is naturally difficult to see immediate results from any endeavor, but the impact on the future is significant. Doing national products work is no different. Therefore, as long as we bury our heads and work hard, the effects will naturally be revealed in our present!</p>
<p>Now is truly the time to begin the work for the second half of the Women's National Products Year. Because I am also a member of the women's community, I will not hide my inadequacy and offer some suggestions. I wonder if the committee will be able to adopt them?</p>
<p>When we do something, we always hope it will have some practical value. Therefore, I feel that we should urgently organize a Women's National Products Society. On the one hand, it is practical, and on the other hand, it can serve as a permanent memorial to the Women's National Products Year. I have written down some key points for organizing the Women's National Products Society below:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose is to promote national products, develop the national economy, and cultivate the habit of using national products.</p>
<p>(2) There are no restrictions on membership qualifications; everyone is welcome to join.</p>
<p>(3) Members shall not purchase or use foreign goods except for necessities for which there are no national product substitutes.</p>
<p>(4) All members must undertake the following tasks:</p>
<p>(A) Introduce compatriots to join the society.</p>
<p>(B) Promote national products.</p>
<p>(C) Investigate the names, trademarks, and manufacturers of national products.</p>
<p>(D) Organize national product stores.</p>
<p>(E) Organize branch societies anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>This Women's National Products Society of my dreams can be large or small. It can be as large as establishing various institutions to promote national products and the China National Products Company, or as small as two or three friends joining together to agree to use national products consistently. My hope is that everyone will do a little to develop the national economy to the best of their ability, especially the intellectuals who have already awakened. They should take the lead because they can clearly see the poisonous strategies of foreign goods dumping. They should take on the responsibility of awakening those who are not yet aware and work hard!</p>

<h3 id="e161">Autumn Has Arrived <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Autumn has arrived, and people's needs for clothing, food, and shelter will naturally require a change of environment. If readers don't believe it, try going to various national product companies and stores to see the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, the hair ornaments and fragrant clothes, and the people coming and going are all purchasing autumn supplies, especially the housewives in charge of household affairs. During this Women's National Products Year, it is truly the most modern and appropriate thing for women to purchase national products. Therefore, some people say that China's future does indeed have some glimmer of hope. Despite the Japanese promoting their goods, establishing Japanese goods markets everywhere, and unscrupulous merchants selling Japanese goods, no one with a level of knowledge above the horizon does not want to use national products, handle national products, and believe in national products. It can be seen that the promotion of national products in the future will be relatively more convenient. However, as people's hearts are deteriorating and there is too much counterfeiting, the patriotic women and young ladies who happily use national products should pay attention to the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) To buy national products, go to national product factories and national product companies with credibility and reputation.</p>
<p>(2) When buying national products, be sure to recognize the trademarks and styles that have a history and achievements to avoid being deceived and confused.</p>
<p>(3) Buying national products requires determination and a willingness to sacrifice, only then can it be effective.</p>
<p>(4) When buying national products, if you find a non-national product, do not condone or tolerate it so that unscrupulous merchants can succeed in their schemes.</p>
<p>(5) When buying national products, think that buying a national product is increasing the country's production power by one point. If you are not careful and buy an enemy product, it is like sending many bullets to them.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Thinking of Some Remedial Measures From a Positive Perspective <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Jian Hua</p>
<p>The characteristic of women loving beauty is innate. And it is deeply rooted and unshakable. If you don't believe it, go to the streets or playgrounds and see. Not to mention women with some charm, everyone likes to put on powder, paint eyebrows, and dye nails. Even those Ugly women with pockmarked faces, protruding eyes, bald heads, and missing teeth, clearly become uglier with makeup, but they still desperately apply powder, curl their hair, spray perfume, and apply lipstick, thinking they are charming and moving. Almost every woman has this kind of self-pity and self-love. There is a sense of (I would rather have no ink in my chest than no powder on my face). Therefore, in recent months, no matter how much written persuasion or verbal explanation there is, saying that so much makeup is imported and advising them not to use foreign goods, they just (turn a deaf ear). Powder and perfume are still imported with increasing quantities. Therefore, I feel that negative obstruction is ineffective. We should still think of remedial measures from a positive perspective of encouraging the use of national products!</p>
<p>Chinese cosmetics have not been without progress in recent years. Except for the general aristocratic class who think it is not extravagant not to use them, most people use tooth powder and toothpaste such as Yonghe Industrial Company's Chang'e brand, Family Industry Society's Invincible brand, or China Chemical Industry Society's Samsung brand. As far as my family and several close relatives are concerned, we absolutely do not use foreign goods except for essential medicines. Cosmetics have been long-time customers of Invincible, Samsung, Guben, and other brands for more than ten years. Especially the products of Invincible brand, because the inventor is the literary scholar, scientist, and industrialist Tianxu Wosheng, we trust the things he supervises the most. Such as powder, snow cream, tooth powder, etc., there are definitely no drawbacks such as harming the skin or damaging teeth. And every time we go to his distribution office to visit, we always feel that there is progress every time. Various goods not only have improvements in substance from time to time, but also are becoming more and more beautiful in terms of decoration. We strive for beauty and can indeed compete with foreign goods. Other things such as Wuzhou Central and other factories' scented soaps and Samsung brand's toothpaste and snow cream are not inferior to imported goods. I very much hope that sisters will buy more, on the one hand, to promote national products, and on the other hand, to no longer bear the crime of being foreign goods salesmen. On the other hand, you can't see the amazing numbers of imported cosmetics. Three things can be achieved in one fell swoop. I think makeup sisters will definitely be happy to implement it! But here I have to declare that I am just a national product lover and have no advertising effect on the above-mentioned manufacturers. The reason why I want to list several brand names is because sisters only know that foreign goods are reliable with certain brands and numbers, and they don't know which national goods are better or worse. Therefore, I dare to introduce several more reliable ones based on my experience and ask sisters to buy them. Finally, if anyone publishes a list of the best manufacturers of daily necessities in this publication in the future (must not contain any advertising nature) so that national product lovers know where to go, this is also a way to promote national products.</p>
<p>In closing, I also hope that many of the best manufacturers of cosmetics will join hands with large companies such as Wing On, Sincere, Lai Wah, and Sun Sun. Each factory carefully selects a large number of goods and sends them to each company for display, and gives them preferential benefits to promote them widely. Most women like to shop at department stores. There are many foreign goods in the company, so they buy foreign goods together. If they are allowed to see a wide array of high-quality national products as soon as they enter the door, their vision and confidence can be attracted. Why don't the major manufacturers try it!</p>

<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>(…Ladies and gentlemen, uncles, brothers and sisters, who would be willing to let your relatives be taken away, killed or humiliated? If this kind of situation really happened, who would not be willing to use force to rescue them? Now I am using the land within China's borders to compare to a person's relatives. The four northeastern provinces were easily taken away by the Japanese on September 18th without any effort, and we have no way to resist it. Some young patriots and the Northeastern Volunteer Army do not hesitate to sacrifice their flesh and blood to provide Japanese guns. I think this kind of meaningless sacrifice can also be said to be of little value. If there is sufficient preparation and there is indeed a possibility of defeating the enemy, then it may be worth attacking. Now, which aspect can be talked about? Having said that, are we just going to pass by silently? No! No! We should all stand up and do something that is even more powerful than using guns to fight them. On the one hand, those with capital should pool capital to establish national factories and expand factories to produce. On the other hand, all Chinese people should use national products. If we persist in this way for five or ten years, then there will be no foreign goods on the Chinese market. I think that although they are powerful, they will be fundamentally shaken because they have lost a good opportunity to sell goods in a dedicated market. Even if they come to invade, they will have no strength. Simply put, they use the surplus production of their countries to sell as much as possible to our country. Our people buy them, and a lot of money flows overseas, which is to provide them with a large amount of capital to build guns and cannons. If, as I said before, the Chinese people unanimously use Chinese goods, what are we afraid of them doing?…) At that time, tens of thousands of people were crowded together, concentrating and listening intently.</p>
<p>(Ladies and gentlemen! The four provinces of Liaoning and Jilin have gone. In the near future, I don't think they will be returned to us. Unless we work hard for the future, when they surrender later, they will naturally return things to their original owners. This all depends on the efforts of the public. This is what happened after the September 18th Incident in the 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Key Decisions of the International Professional and Technical Education Conference <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The International Professional and Technical Education Conference is organized by France, Belgium, England, Germany, Italy, Spain, Egypt, Poland, and other countries. The president is the famous French scholar Mr. Nabes (Labbé). The inaugural meeting was held in Paris last year. The second international conference was held in Barcelona, Spain on May 17 this year. China was invited to participate by letter, but due to economic and time constraints, no representatives were sent. However, the Ministry of Education appointed Xie Shuying, section chief of the Higher Education Department, as a correspondent last year to communicate with the International Education Bureau at any time. (The bureau pays attention to international education news, and Mr. Xie is collecting materials to communicate with the bureau.) After the conference closed, the International Professional and Technical Education Bureau recently sent the main resolutions of the conference to the Ministry of Education. The original translation is very long. The following is an excerpt of its outline:</p>
<p>(1) The Trend of Vocational Education: The International Professional and Technical Education Conference (hereinafter referred to as "the Conference") believes that professional education and vocational education are very important from an economic and social standpoint and meet the needs of modern life. Therefore, all civilized countries have included this vocational education in their development plans. It is hoped that this type of education will obtain its due position in various countries.</p>
<p>(2) Vocational Guidance Methods: Because the education systems of some countries have not yet conformed to the International Labour Conference's proposed permissible age for children's work in stipulating children's schooling and permissible working age, it is hoped that professional education institutions will request the authorities to have appropriate regulations on children's working age and implement them immediately. On the one hand, during the years of compulsory education, in addition to teaching children the necessary general education, they should also be taught work skills so that children have the ability to choose skills and occupations.</p>
<p>Professional schools and the vocational world should strive to communicate and link up so that future vocational departments can be changed as needed by the times, and labour legislation should stipulate that all young workers must complete vocational education.</p>
<p>The International Professional and Technical Education Bureau should research the problems of vocational education that feel deficient in substance or spirit and investigate the methods of various countries that can solve this problem to remedy the deficiencies.</p>
<p>The Conference is deeply afraid that the results of vocational guidance will still not enable students leaving school to have a place to belong. Therefore, it is hoped that various places will borrow the strength of the government and organize several institutions within the scope permitted by national laws to accommodate those who have left primary school and are determined to learn skills, to provide them with employment guidance and to sincerely exercise the duties of guardians until the end of the learning period.</p>
<p>(3) Learning and Unemployment Issues: In terms of learning, technical learning, drawing, and factory practice should be closely linked. Internship work should be increased to quickly manufacture useful items. The Conference Committee hopes that at the next conference, it will take the opportunity to create a course work exhibition for mutual observation.</p>
<p>The Conference recognizes that unemployment poses a very serious danger to national culture. Therefore, it decided to adopt various effective methods such as (striving to adapt vocational education to the environment) and (creating special factories to cultivate vocational talents, etc.) to prevent various unemployment panics.</p>
<p>(4) Higher Professional Education Issues: The Conference believes that engineers with higher professional education can be cultivated through various methods, but they must all go through a sufficient period of study, receive considerable general education, and have the general professional knowledge that engineers must study. In addition, they must have expertise in their specialization. It is generally believed that the training of engineers should be carried out in schools with scientific training.</p>
<p>The Conference also recognizes that the number of technical talents is increasing day by day, their levels are uneven, and the difficulty of technicians seeking employment. Therefore, it decided that higher technical professional schools should adopt strict admission standards and that the issuance of graduation diplomas should be subject to strict government supervision. A part of those who study and learn on their own must have qualified academic ability and ability before they can apply for an engineer's certificate. At the same time, the outlets for engineers should be considered according to the needs of the industry to seek an appropriate supply and demand ratio.</p>
<p>The Conference conducted discussions on the management and protection of higher education and the position of engineers. It was generally believed that the profession of engineers is different from other liberal professions and has no national boundaries. It is proposed that the International Professional and Technical Education Bureau comprehensively compare the higher professional and technical education situation in various countries and formulate higher professional and technical education regulations and protection of academic degree regulations.</p>
<p>The Conference hopes that professional education will be divided into three levels in terms of the education system. The purpose of the first type of professional school is to create practical workers. The curriculum of the school has a broader scientific training than the former. The purpose is to create personnel with management and control capabilities. The third type of higher professional school enrolls students who have graduated from the previous two types of schools to receive deeper education and hopes to invite industrialists and industrial associations to participate in the board of directors of professional schools so that they can give instructions on the curriculum of professional schools.</p>
<p>(5) Contract Issues for Learning and Apprenticeships: The Conference believes that learning contracts should be a guarantee contract, an education contract, and the purpose is a standard for vocational training. It is hoped that this contract must be in writing to protect learners and apprentices from vocational training.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Zhou Fo Hai, Director of Education for Jiangsu Province, Addresses All Secondary School Students <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>(1) Hoping that diet, daily life, and actions conform to the principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.</p>
<p>(2) Hoping to strive towards the two major goals of production and national defense.</p>
<p>Zhou Fo Hai, Director of Education for Jiangsu Province, addresses all secondary school students in Jiangsu in a letter, saying: Jiangsu's secondary education is known to be advanced. I, Fo Hai, upon appointment here, have the opportunity to meet and interact with students from all secondary schools in Jiangsu. I am sincerely pleased. From the beginning of my tenure, I deeply recognize the rampant study atmosphere and the declining moral principles as serious illnesses in today's school education. I intend to learn from the past and be cautious in the future to meet the expectations of the people of Jiangsu. Therefore, for those who incite disturbances and disrupt discipline, I will have to take decisive measures and impose strict sanctions with a heavy heart. After the pain subsides, I will repeatedly and earnestly persuade and emphasize the principle that studying is saving the country, and to save the country, one must study, showing students the correct path of learning. In recent years, the study atmosphere has changed for the better. The courage of the province's students to embrace good has truly given me boundless hopes. I cherish the youth and never advocate leniency. What I worry about day and night is how students can improve their studies, cultivate their character, strengthen their bodies, and whether they can recognize the mission of the times and shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. Leniency is no different from poison to the students; I will certainly not do that.</p>
<p>Using education to save the country is a consistent proposition for the whole country today, and it is also a truly effective and unchanging method. If one wants to achieve the effect of saving the country through education, the spiritual aspect must imbue education with the spirit of saving the country, and the material aspect must also prepare education for saving the country. In other words, education must become truly national-saving education and sweep away the emptiness of the past. I have long understood this. For several years, I have been striving with all my strength to promote and advance this kind of education. However, the target of education is all of our young students. If the students cannot thoroughly recognize their current responsibilities and work together to pursue the path of saving the country, then one-sided efforts will not help the reality. Therefore, in addition to my personal efforts, I must place this expectation on all students. At the beginning of the year, I am listing several points for the students to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the basic conditions for being a person and the fundamental spirit for establishing a country. Without propriety and righteousness, there will be chaos between superiors and subordinates, and there will be no organization. Without integrity and shame, one will be perverse and do anything, and there will be no discipline. Once organization and discipline are lost, the country and nation will inevitably be in danger. The severity of China's national crisis today is due to this. Therefore, if we want to talk about saving the country through education today, we must use the entire educational force to revive our nation's inherent spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. There is no other way. Only with this spirit can we achieve education that saves the country; otherwise, it will be enough to destroy the country, let alone save it. What I hope for from the students today is not only the advancement of their studies but also the establishment of the basic conditions for being a person. If there is no cultivation of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame in school, then the conditions for being a person are incomplete. Even if one's studies are successful, it will not only be useless to the country and society but also contribute to wickedness and disorder. Knowing that being a person can be so harmful, the students should be aware and abide by school rules, pay attention to discipline, and obey the guidance of teachers. They should strive to improve themselves in everything, so that their diet, daily life, and all actions conform to the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, creating a new lifestyle. It must be known that intellectuals are the leaders of society. If all the intellectuals in the country can practice the life of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, then the impact of their voices will create great power, and the foundation for the revival of the country and nation will not need to be sought elsewhere. I will devote my full efforts to continuous promotion and advancement. The students should also recognize the principles of being a person and automatically strive for the cultivation of their character, taking the lead in creating this atmosphere.</p>
<p>Saving the country cannot be achieved by empty talk; there must be sufficient preparation. Preparation of material strength is especially necessary. Therefore, today's education should focus on the two central goals of production and national defense. Education that does not have the effect of production will inevitably be empty. Education that does not contribute to national defense is tantamount to being useless. Empty and useless education is certainly not enough to save the country. I have spared no effort to adopt any effective methods to change the direction of education. The facts are there, and I believe you are well aware. What I hope for from the students is to work hard towards these two major goals, so that education can achieve the practical effect of saving the country. In terms of production, there are both positive and negative meanings. The positive aspect is the cultivation of production skills and the development of a work ethic. The negative aspect is suppressing material desires and reducing personal consumption. This is the true spirit of today's school education, and it is what the students should deeply recognize and automatically strive to realize. In terms of national defense, the students cannot immediately make significant contributions. However, national defense depends on science. Changes in the situation of the borderlands and the assessment of the enemy's and our own national conditions depend on the study of history and geography. The invention of defensive and offensive weapons, as well as the application of new tactics, are closely related to training in subjects such as physics, chemistry, and military affairs. By analogy, almost every subject is related to national defense. If the students lay a solid foundation for science today, it will be no different from the entire nation broadly reserving basic tools for national defense. I deeply hope that they will continuously research with a spirit of initiative, gradually progressing from experimental steps to creation. Paying attention to physical education and striving for military training is sufficient to strengthen physical fitness and break the habit of being weak. In the event of war, it is even sufficient to defend the country and protect the nation. Its contribution to national defense is even more practical. All of these are what the students should strive for in school today, and it is by no means a harsh requirement from me.</p>
<p>In short, the crisis of the country and nation today is imminent. The only thing we can rely on to save the country and maintain the survival of the nation is education. If we want to achieve the practical effect of saving the country through education, we must change our course and imbue education with the spirit of saving the country and the preparation of material strength. If I cannot recognize the importance of national-saving education and do my best to promote it internally, then it is my fault. If the students cannot thoroughly recognize their current responsibilities and work together to pursue the path of saving the country, then the students will be abandoning their duty, and there will be no escaping blame. It is my duty to supervise and urge each other and never be lenient, so as not to mislead the students and mislead the entire country and nation. The words are earnest and sincere; put them into practice and do not slacken. September 1, 1934.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th) The new building of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica in Beijige has been completed. It will move from Shanghai to Beijing on the 26th and begin operations on the 1st of next month.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, upon investigation of the Jianwen Private Primary School in Chunhui Lane, Aierjin Road, and the Cihua Private Primary School in Qingshan Lane, Aierjin Road, found that the facilities were simple, the order was chaotic, and the teaching was ineffective.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education Announces an Interpretation Based on an Order from the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education recently received an interpretation from the Ministry of Education regarding the meaning of the phrase "one organization" in Item 2 of the Measures for Religious Organizations to Run Educational Undertakings and notified all schools as follows: According to the instruction No. 10702 from the Ministry of Education, "The Measures for Religious Organizations to Run Educational Undertakings were previously formulated by the Ministry and promulgated in April of the 18th year, with orders for compliance. Subsequently, the Education Department of Zhejiang Province requested an interpretation of the meaning of the phrase 'organization' in Item 2 of the measures. The interpretation given was that the phrase 'organization' refers to churches, temples, or societies and training centers established by believers of various religions for the purpose of preaching and explaining doctrines, focusing on religious teachings, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. Recently, it has been found that some religious organizations are still establishing organizations under their own names. Although they do not use the name of schools on the surface, they are actually school organizations, which is inappropriate. It is now clearly stipulated that religious organizations establishing schools should follow the revised regulations for private schools. If they establish organizations to transmit religious doctrines, they must not use the name of schools, nor imitate school regulations, compile curricula, enroll school-age children, or youths under the age of eighteen, and teach subjects that should be taught in primary and secondary schools, in order to prevent misuse and avoid confusion. In addition to this announcement, it is hereby ordered that compliance be followed and further ordered for compliance."</p>

<p>The high school department of Fudan University was formerly the preparatory course of Fudan University. In the 21st year, it was renamed Jiangwan High School Department. All administrative matters were coordinated with the Xujiahui Affiliated Middle School. However, because the Ministry of Education promulgated revised regulations for various schools, middle schools are not allowed to establish branch schools, but should be established separately and independently. The school affairs meeting decided to rename it Fudan Senior High School. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education was requested to change the name, and it is said that approval has been granted.</p>

<p>I have read the news item "Second Anniversary of the Shanhai Industrial School Group" published in your newspaper on the 26th of this month, which states that it was founded by me. This is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Upon investigation, the founder of the group was the rural educator Dr. Tao Zhixing, who painstakingly managed it with more than 3,000 yuan from his manuscript fees to experiment with life education. There is no work-study program. Although I know it well, I have not made any donations and dare not take credit for it. I hereby make this correction. Huang Jingwan.</p>

<p>Open to All Nationalities</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Jai Alai from Europe through the Central Sports Ground in this city several years ago, Shanghai residents have become very interested in it. Therefore, the number of people practicing this sport is increasing day by day. However, due to a lack of promotion, the organization of amateur Jai Alai clubs in Shanghai and the launch of open amateur championships have not yet been carried out. Now, the French Barracks Athletic Association, in view of this, has specially launched a campaign to collect prizes from all walks of life and host the Shanghai Open Amateur Jai Alai Single, Double, and Triple Championships. Regardless of nationality, all can participate. According to this move, it is still an innovative concept in the sports world. Those who have this hobby are encouraged to participate actively and work together to make it a success.

<h3 id="e192">Gold Market Chaotic as Major Silver Rises to 22 Pence <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The gold market presented a calm situation yesterday. People's hearts were tired at first and then firm. The difference during half a day was limited. The exchange rate situation was mediocre, and the situation was stagnant in the middle. However, under the British's active expansion, the general trend is still difficult to improve, resulting in a decline. In the early morning, the overseas silver market and the British and American markets rose unanimously. London's raw gold rose by three and a half pence, and the exchange rate continued to fall. However, under the circumstances of the public's emphasis on British silver, it is difficult to have an impact. American wheat rose by 1.125 points, and American cotton was average. Stocks rose by more than two yuan. After the market closed, the off-market pre-trading was flat due to the saying that buyers were satisfied with the closing of the major silver markets. Reuters reported that American Bank Representative Pittman defended President Roosevelt's silver nationalization plan at a mining conference, and said that although the President was worried that he would tend to inflate paper money, he also believed that inflation was inevitable. In addition, with the continued devaluation of the gold pound by the British, people's hearts were not firm and then fell. Although a new low price of 930.7 yuan appeared after opening, large households bought, and the surface seemed dry. The HSBC Bank's quotations for British and American exchange rates were long, but they did not care. The internal market was tight, and it was rumored that the Central Bank had opened a spot transaction. For a time, buying was extremely strong and rose. Although there were sources of supply at high prices, due to the bank's appetite, it was still high even at low prices. However, people's hearts were confused, and transactions in the market were sometimes strong and sometimes clear, so the market situation became hovering. Although the potential slightly turned soft, there was no shortage of buyers after the low, and the struggle lasted for a long time. At noon, there was a sudden selling trend and a slight downstream, but after the market closed, it was maintained by Guangbang Hengxing and was still calm. The new standard for December was the same. Although it was stable in the middle, it was difficult to maintain for a long time because the Central Bank lowered the gold price. The number of chips for the November period increased to more than 28,000, and the number of long and short positions was still disparate, and the trend was inevitably hovering. The market situation for half a day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 931 yuan, which was lower than the previous close, down 2.2 yuan. The exchange rate market opened with recent selling prices. The British exchange rate was a pair of 1 shilling, 5 pence, 375 and 4375, and the US exchange rate was 36.125 yuan. Shenkang sold strips and retreated to 0.7 yuan. Fuxingyong, Yuanyi, Yuanmaoyong, Yuankangxiang, Qingyu, Yongfeng, Fu'an, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Zhaofengchang, Zhentai, Yuanchun, Daxingyong, etc. all entered and gradually rose. The HSBC Bank's quotations for British and American exchange rates each rose by 1.125, but it was still difficult to be satisfied. In addition, there was a rumor that the Central Bank had opened a spot transaction, and people's hearts were greatly strengthened. The chips felt dry, and they rose to 4.3 yuan. In the middle of the way, the bank stuffed out 1.25 US dollars in October, which was quite a lot of plate heads. Although Hengyu, Dingkang, Yuanxing, Yuanmaoyong, etc. sold to 3.3 yuan, they were still stable because Citibank was picking up 0.25 US dollars in January.

Nos. 14, 46, 50, and 77, etc. all had sales, while Nos. 4 and 48, etc. had quite a lot of purchases. The market price could not be boosted, or it would rise again. Today is the settlement of futures and the market is closed. From tomorrow, the auction of November futures will be added, or there will be a larger wave. Yesterday, after the opening, the price uniformly returned to a small 1-2 jiao to 6-7 jiao. In the second round, it continued to be covered.

<p>Third Grade Yarn Rises by Four, Five, or Six Yuan for Near and Distant Months</p>
<p>The yarn market had stabilized, gradually showing signs of calm after a significant drop. However, yarn trading has become sluggish again, leading to a slight weakening of market sentiment. Nevertheless, new offerings remain scarce. In the afternoon, it was reported that Dongyang third-grade yarn rose by five or six yuan for near months and three or four yuan for distant months. After a drop, standard yarn rebounded, and the market remains in a hovering state.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Near Month Rises, Distant Month Falls. Standard yarn opened in the morning, with each month falling by six or seven jiao due to the sluggishness of the American and Indian cotton markets, and some floating accounts selling out in the market. By the second or third round of trading, the market rebounded by four or five jiao due to cotton market tension. As a result, each month fell by two or three jiao. In the afternoon opening, with actual yarn sales relatively slow, only about a thousand bales were traded, and the market saw more sellers, resulting in a further drop of three, four, or five jiao. By the second or third closing, Dongyang third-grade yarn was reported to have rebounded by five or six yuan, slightly shaking market sentiment. As a result, each month rose by one, two, or three jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 26,400 bales. Sales were as follows: Tongji 400 bales, Dafeng 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Shenchang 450 bales, Taichang 500 bales, Xiesheng 500 bales, Chongan 1,550 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, Dachang 1,350 bales.

<p>The cotton market is trending upward, but the American and Indian cotton markets remain weak. The bulls in this port are not releasing the amount absorbed in October and there is talk of a cotton squeeze. Therefore, the situation in October is uniquely high, but the need for spot cotton remains sluggish. In the afternoon, voices of a cotton squeeze were increasingly loud in the market.</p>
<p>Near-Term Squeeze Rises Four Jiao: Standard cotton opened in the morning, with market conditions still average. Due to the sharp decline in Indian cotton, by the second or third round of trading, October became suddenly tight, with speculators buying and rumors of several flower firms uniting to squeeze the market, causing market sentiment to be excited.

When the opening price was set, due to a slightly better mood among the bulls, the opening price was stable, with little change from the previous day. After the second round, because factories were still selling hedges and actual sales gangs were still inactive, the long-term market atmosphere gradually declined again. However, because the drop was too severe the previous day, it seemed to be about to stop, so the drop was also limited. By the afternoon opening, with the stabilization of the morning situation, the bulls did not rush to sell, and the floating shorts engaged in covering, and factories slightly reduced the amount of selling, so market sentiment was tight, and the market gradually turned better. However, after a sharp fall, this kind of good momentum is still only a slight rebound. As a result, this month rebounded by one fen and seven li and half, October rose by three fen and seven li and half, November and December rose by three fen and two li and half, January rose by three fen and seven li and half, and February rose by three fen.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Wheat Futures Rebound in the Aftermarket <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>丨Results are still slightly small丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market opened in the morning, and the market conditions for each month showed a flat and sluggish trend. Although the price of foreign wheat was slightly better by four fen to two or three jiao, the market sentiment was generally weak. This month's return was the last day, and the non-professional bulls had to clear their positions. The opening price was still average, but soon did not reach three jiao and seven fen, so the long-term market also saw a decline, falling by three to five fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, this month was still stable at first, but later rebounded due to short covering. The long term was also stronger due to the flour market turning bullish, rising by five, seven, or eight fen compared to the morning. As a result, this month was still down by a small one fen, October rose by six fen, November rose by eight fen, December rose by seven fen, January rose by five fen, and February remained unchanged. The spot wheat market was driven up by three to five fen due to the good factory demand, the middle and secondary grades remained average. Shandong Xuzhou wheat opened at three yuan, five jiao, and half, the second grade was five jiao and one fen, Bengbu wheat was three yuan, five jiao, and one fen, the second grade was four jiao and eight fen, Qingjiang wheat was three yuan, four jiao, and nine fen, Wuhe wheat was three yuan, five jiao, and one fen, Jiangbei wheat was three yuan, four jiao, six or seven fen, and Daqiao wheat was three yuan, four jiao, and seven fen, totaling 30,000 bags, which were handled by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Shenda.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Suppressing Rice Purchases Creates Opportunities for Foreign Rice <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice prices slightly rebounded yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, some shipments of customer xián rice arrived, because the early rice harvest in the upper reaches of Hunan and Hubei was still good, and the late rice did not suffer much from disasters. However, because there were restrictions on the export of early rice from Hunan Province, large shipments still arrived at the port. The digestion of customer xián rice was sluggish and affected by foreign rice. The reason it was able to maintain the situation was that various producing areas had banned transportation and restricted exports. There were slightly more arrivals yesterday, but there was no activity from customers, and general traders were disappointed that the customer handling was not active after the festival. Therefore, customer xián brown rice prices all softened. Shashi and Hankou brown rice decreased by nearly one jiao, while steamed rice and Zhangzhou brown rice each decreased by three or five fen. A total of 2,288 bags were traded, with domestic transactions being small and most being purchased by local merchants taking advantage of the small prices.</p>
<p>Spot prices of foreign rice also decreased slightly by four or five fen to nearly one jiao. Only a small number of local transactions and 500 bags from Saigon were handled throughout the day. However, there were inquiries from Jiangxi Province for futures, and the market turned bullish. It is estimated that 350 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice will be opened in September, with the price still at four yuan and eight jiao, and 300 tons in October, with the price at four yuan, nine jiao, and three fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source from Hunan, Shanghai, was similar to the previous day, still only around the 15th or 16th (a total of more than 2,000 shi of goods), and the sales market was also the same. However, the situation seemed more chaotic, and the opinions of various passengers on the selling price differed. Although the Qingdao gang continued to purchase more than 100 bags of late rice, the market price did not show any signs of improvement. The situation for various thick粳 rice was difficult to grasp, and it was only average. Only new粳 rice, because supply and demand were quite matched, the market was stable. The market situation for new pointed rice, etc., was still tight, and the source of arrivals was limited, so the prices of new Lu and foreign pointed rice were both able to continue to increase by a jiao or so. Because Baige rice was the only fresh one in the whole city, it also improved by five fen, and the lack of supply made it tight.</p>
<h3 id="e206">New Miscellaneous Grains Have a 70% Harvest <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, newly issued miscellaneous grains arrived in Shanghai. It is reported that the harvest this year is still good. According to reports from various producing areas, the total harvest is 70%. Therefore, soybeans, corn, mung beans, sesame, peanuts, raw kernels, and peas will continue to arrive. Yesterday, the new goods included more than 400 bags of Bengbu mung beans, with the wholesale price at four yuan and one jiao, and 30 bags of Jiaxing peas, with the price at three yuan and two jiao. The previous day, 50 bags of soybeans arrived in Xin'an Town, with the price opening at three yuan and three jiao and a half, 50 bags of red sorghum in Xin'an Town, with the price opening at two yuan and three jiao and eight, 100 bags of peanuts in Xin'an Town, with the price at five yuan, 48 bags of Jiujiang milk sesame, with the price opening at six yuan, and 22 bags of Jiujiang late beans, with the price opening at three yuan and seven jiao and a half. The quality of the above grains is still excellent, but because they are new goods, they are inevitably soft.</p>

<p>The first batch of dried longan meat from Shima was once sold for 75 yuan, but then gradually fell. The recent source of supply has slightly increased, and land prices have also fallen. According to a telegram from Zhangzhou yesterday, land prices have fallen by another two or three yuan. Therefore, the previous batch of arrivals temporarily lacked buyers, and the future market is difficult to be optimistic, and further declines are still being prevented.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Orchid Seed Market Price Gradually Falls <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The number of new orchid seeds issued this year is not many, so the initial price was nearly 50 yuan. Later, due to reduced sales, it dropped by four or five yuan. Who knew that the demand was completely sluggish, and the price continued to drop. Yesterday, the market price was 36 yuan, and there were few buyers. The price has fallen by as much as twelve or thirteen yuan before and after, and the future market is still difficult to stabilize.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market for 24 coarse sand white was weaker due to the sharp fall in off-grade goods. The association's official price for ordinary new goods was 19 yuan and three jiao, the price for goods from this warehouse was 19 yuan and four jiao, and the price for re-exported goods was six yuan and one jiao, all down by one jiao from the previous day. 89荷赤叫荷赤叫Hé chì jiào grade was offered at 13 yuan and nine jiao, but no sale was made, the re-exported goods were four yuan and nine jiao, down by a small jiao. A large off-grade goods merchant opened up 500 tons of 24 coarse sand for October and November, with the price being only 2.8荷盾Hé dùn Dutch guilders, a drop of three or four jiao from the previous day. Later, the price was叫荷盾Hé dùnDutch guilders, but few people accepted it. Taikoo Sugar B mark was also down by a small jiao, to 19 yuan and eight jiao. The first grade of cotton white from this factory was 17 yuan and nine jiao. The Chaoqing was stable, and more than 100 bags of Qing was opened from Tizhuang, at 13 yuan and a half.</p>

<p>丨American Sales Also Activated丨</p>
<p>Double Palace Silk: Indian demand is increasingly strong. The Fulunheng and Honglun double palace silk factories in this port are processing and reeling to meet the needs of Indian merchants. This month, 151 bags of double palace silk have been shipped to India, and Indian merchants still have more than 70 bags in hand, preparing to be shipped by the British company's ship on the second of next month.</p>
<p>The New York raw silk market has seen a turnaround. The silk factories are now gradually starting to buy, and the Yokohama Japanese silk market price is gradually rising. Therefore, both Chinese and Japanese silk prices are trending firmly upward. European and American firms in Shanghai have all asked Chinese merchants to send telegrams, and the market atmosphere is gradually becoming active. Yesterday, Xinfu and others shipped 50 bags of white factory warp and 10 bags of Baigan warp, and the prices were firm.</p>

<p>In the areas of Hushu, Liangzhu, and the upper four villages of Hangzhou, this year, due to drought and famine, only five or six out of ten households have raised and incubated silkworms. Moreover, the early silkworms have been greatly affected by the weather during the major sleep, and many have been discarded. Although the early cocoons have already been on the market, the cocoon production has been greatly reduced, and the cocoon price is not high, averaging only sixteen or seventeen yuan. The late silkworms are quickly producing leaves, and the early gang can go to the cluster soon.</p>
<p>In various cities and villages in Fuyang, this year's autumn silkworms have been affected by the weather, with drought causing disasters, mulberry leaves withering and yellowing. Later, the weather was abnormal, with continuous rain and sultry heat, and both early and late silkworms were damaged. The early fresh cocoons have already been on the market, and the cocoon price is only 20 yuan at most and 14 yuan at least due to the control. The current situation of the late silkworms is better, and they can go to the cluster soon. It is estimated that the cocoon production will be at most 60% of the usual amount.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market showed signs of a slight turnaround. The British firms Jinlong and Tongfu, etc., were not buying small amounts of Zhenmei green tea with pulled cores from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Shexian, etc. Sales of the needle eyebrow and pearl tea items were slightly more active. However, the selling price at the opening of the market was still falling without rising due to weak market sentiment. The top price of Pulled Core Zhenmei was no more than 143 yuan, and the top price of ordinary Zhenmei was 90 yuan, Needle Eyebrow was 40 yuan, and Pearl Tea was 85 yuan, which was two or three yuan to five or six yuan lower than last week.</p>

<p>The Price of Chinese Silk in London Rises Sharply: Due to a major wind disaster in Japan, the price of Yokohama Japanese silk is gradually rising, and the price of Chinese silk has also been invited to rise. The opening price of A-grade Mei brand from Qili Qianjing on Monday was five shillings and seven and a half pence, and the opening price of B-grade Lion brand was five shillings and one and a half pence, each rising by one and a half pence per pound, equivalent to a rise of about ten yuan per bag in Chinese currency.</p>
<p>European and American Silk Telegrams Transferred to Shanghai Awaiting: The textile industry strike in the United States is currently being mediated. Silk factories in New York are slightly more willing to purchase, and the price of Japanese silk is rising sharply. However, the rebound of Chinese silk is very small. European and American silk telegrams transferred to Shanghai are limited. Although European firms in Shanghai are willing to purchase, the opening price is not high. Chinese silk merchants insist on selling only when the price rises. Therefore, yesterday, only Yuanchang and others shipped 50 bags of white factory warp.</p>

<p>The market atmosphere for women's woolen overcoating has been good recently, and sales to local customers have been quite smooth. Women's clothing stores in areas such as Simalu have a particularly strong demand. Most of the ready-made women's overcoats purchased by various customers are wholesale purchased from there. Flannel, fancy woolen fabric, and overcoating wool fabrics all have clever matching patterns. Those priced at four or five yuan per yard are more suitable for smooth sales. There have been large transactions in the existing stocks of Lorraine from foreign firms such as Ruiwen Huabo and Shililuo. The market sales of plain and thick woolen fabrics in basic colors priced at two yuan and more and single-sided overcoating woolen fabrics with patterned dots priced at three yuan and more are also quite smooth.</p>

<p>Telegrams from London, Berlin, and New York have reported that the price of tinplate is rising every day. The market in this city is also different from the past. For example, 90-pound single-linked American tinplate opens at 16 yuan and two jiao and a half, and double-linked opens at 32 yuan and five jiao. 100-pound single-linked opens at 17 yuan, and double-linked opens at 33 yuan and seven jiao and a half. Due to the lack of single-linked German goods, double-linked 90-pound opens at 31 yuan, and double-linked opens at 32 yuan and five jiao. British goods of all colors are out of stock, so there is no market to report. However, overseas telegrams are very good, which are described in detail below:</p>

Because the inventory is low, the existing stock has been almost completely searched. The market price is 27 yuan per dan, and it has been gradually increased to 28 yuan and five jiao. 14 and 16号 are out of stock, and 12 号 still has a small amount in circulation.

<h3 id="e218">Hunger in Tang Poetry <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Zepu</p>
<p>After the An Lushan Rebellion, Tang society fell into a dim state of turmoil and instability. Political turmoil was to be expected, but the economic exhaustion was more severe than one could imagine. Because in that kind of situation ("Under heaven, all countries turn to ten thousand cities, but there is no city without armor and weapons.") and ("Of the two hundred prefectures in Shandong of the Han Dynasty, a thousand villages and ten thousand trees grow thorny shrubs."), the collapse of the economic foundation was a necessary result. The people who lived at that time tasted some suffering, but imagined events are not reliable, and it is only the handwriting in historical records that can give us an accurate explanation.</p>
<p>In Tang poetry, much of the social conditions of that time is preserved, especially in the works of Du Fu and Bai Juyi, which contain more descriptions of this kind of actual social phenomena. I have always enjoyed reading Tang poetry, and I pay special attention to these kinds of works; among them, what I cannot forget the most is the misery of the people who suffered from (hunger) at that time.</p>
<p>Among the common people, whose desires are not high and whose thoughts are simple, (having food) and (not having food) really determined all the joy and suffering of their lives; moreover, it is only the two questions of (having food) and (not having food) that are the main factors that determine the prosperity of any nation's history. Before the An Lushan Rebellion, Tang society was a happy society of peace and prosperity. At that time, politics was clear and the economy was abundant, and the lives of the people were very comfortable and smooth; but since the Sound of Rainbow Feathers and Robes by Emperor Xuanzong was startled by the drums of Yuyang, the Central Plains fell into the sorrow of famine and turmoil. Du Fu has a poem "Recalling the Past," which describes the two different situations before and after that time quite thoroughly. The poem says:</p>
<p>(Recalling the prosperous days of the Kaiyuan era, even small towns stored houses with families. Rice flowed like grease, millet was white, and the public and private granaries were full and substantial. There were no wolves or tigers on the roads of the Nine Provinces, and traveling far did not require choosing an auspicious day. Fine silk and Lu silk were everywhere, men plowed and women weaved without neglecting their duties. The sage in the palace played the Cloud Gate music, and all friends under heaven were like close relatives. For more than a hundred years, there were no disasters, and the rites of Shusun and the laws of Xiao He prevailed. Who would have heard that a single piece of silk was worth ten thousand coins? Today, plowing the fields to plant grain causes bloodshed. The palaces in Luoyang have been burned and destroyed, and the ancestral temples have become dens for foxes and rabbits. I am heartbroken and cannot bear to ask the elders, for fear of hearing about the chaos and separation from the beginning!...)</p>
<p>Old Du was a person who personally experienced both the era of peace and the era of rebellion, so what he recorded was true. From this, we can see that the situation changed completely.</p>
<p>Since the era before the An Lushan Rebellion was an era of peace and prosperity, the people's livelihood was naturally happy. This is also clearly visible in the early Tang poetry. The reason why the collections of Li Bai, Cen Shen, Gao Shi, Wang Wei, and others are full of the (smell of wine) is because they were in a comfortable environment; but in the later Tang poetry, it is full of the glaring words of hunger and cold. Look:</p>
<p>(I want to go to face hunger and thirst with you, ...... my youngest son has already died of hunger!) (Expressing My Feelings on the Way to Fengxian County)</p>
<p>(Autumn comes and turns to hunger and cold.) (Because of Imperial Censor Cui Wu and Pengzhou Gao)</p>
<p>(Hunger causes people to exchange children to eat.) (Farewell to Tang Fifteen Commandments)</p>
<p>(The faces of hungry young children are always sad!) (Madman)</p>
<p>(On this day, hunger and cold drive me to the roadside.) (Do Not Suspect Each Other)</p>
<p>(Hunger and cold press toward the corner.) (Leaving Jiangling Nampu by Boat)</p>
<p>(A woman with no food and no children.) (Presenting to Wu Lang Again)</p>
<p>(My foolish daughter bites me because of hunger.) (Peng Ya Trip)</p>
<p>(I endure hunger all day long, going west and then east.) (White Egret Trip)</p>
<p>(Enduring hunger on Floating Cloud Cliff.) (Eight Elegies)</p>
<p>(Picking oak acorns in the stream due to hunger.) (Eight Elegies)</p>
<p>(Hunger and cold eternally look at each other.) (Remnant Joy One)</p>
<p>(Hunger and cold chirp all day long.) (Phoenix Terrace)</p>
<p>The above are from Du Fu.</p>
<p>(In a year of hunger, there are no leftover grains, ... suffering from hunger disfigures the face.) (Expressing Sentiments)</p>
<p>(Singing for hunger and snow four times.) (Singing for Hunger and Snow)</p>
<p>(A hungry person values a single meal.) (Autumn Thoughts Eleven)</p>
<p>(The heart is about to collapse from late hunger!) (Autumn Thoughts Seventeen)</p>
<p>(Eating unnamed vegetables due to hunger.) (Living in Qing'an)</p>
<p>(Hungry children and hungry horses sweep flowers to feed.) (Cold Food Day in Jiyuan Three)</p>
<p>(Starving to death, embracing empty mountains.) (Mourning Lu Yin)</p>
<p>The above are from Meng Dongye.</p>
<p>(The lanes and wells are full of people who have died of hunger.) (Returning to Pengcheng)</p>
<p>(Hungry cries are but chirps.) (Obstructed by Wind on Dongting Lake, Giving to Zhang Eleven Shu)</p>
<p>The above are from Han Changli.</p>
<p>(Picking these to fill the hungry intestines.) (Watching Wheat Harvesting)</p>
<p>(Saving these to relieve the bitter hunger.) (Gathering Rehmannia)</p>
<p>(Guarding poverty and hunger all year round.) (There Is a Tomb in the Hill)</p>
<p>(What to do when hunger comes?) (Continuing Ancient Poems Three)</p>
<p>(The heat is fierce, the days are long, and hunger makes me want to die!) (Catching Locusts)</p>
<p>(Dining and drinking causes hunger and thirst.) (Tying Up Rong People)</p>
<p>The above are from Bai Juyi. In addition, Yuan Jie's (Morning meals are grass roots, evening meals are still tree bark.) ("Spring Mausoleum Trip") is also nothing more than writing about the misery of hunger!</p>
<p>For the common people who lived in troubled times, suffering from hunger and cold was not considered a strange thing. The suffering of the Chinese people after the middle of the eighth century was like this, and the suffering in later troubled times was also like this. When I read Du Fu's sentence (Hunger causes people to exchange children to eat), I could not help but think of the events of people exchanging children to eat during the famine in various provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi in past years! As for eating flowers, eating grass roots, and eating tree bark, that is even more commonly seen and heard in ancient and modern times, but eating stone powder, eating sand, and eating soil was unprecedented in the past!</p>
<p>As the saying goes: (I would rather be a dog in times of peace than a commoner in times of chaos), this saying is really true. Dogs in peaceful times are indeed much happier than people in turbulent times. Because the dogs in peaceful times have things to eat and places to play, while the common people in turbulent times not only have to suffer from hunger and cold, but also do not have freedom of movement!</p>

<p>— Yao Yiyun</p>
<p>丨A Sketch from the Outskirts of Xi'an丨</p>
<p>Dust, stirred up by the clumsy wheels of a rolling cart, flies up and billows like surging angry waves.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man sits leisurely in the donkey cart. The cart's decorations, somewhat like a cabin on a Jiangnan boat, display a national essence-style beauty, with orange tassels hanging from the window edges.</p>
<p>His eyes don't glance at the crows and eagles soaring in the sky; he only peers through ancient, wide-rimmed, white copper spectacles perched on the tip of his nose, focusing on a scroll of a book held in his hand, reading line by line. I cannot know what national essence masterpiece it is; I imagine it's probably "Shi Gong An" or "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." His dedication is enough to make me deeply admire him; this kind of diligent spirit is enough to allow Chinese culture to catch up with the world's trends head-on. Furthermore, his serene and leisurely attitude fully reveals the ancient style of our vast nation of five thousand years. Look at him, calmly reading his book while holding the rope whip, with a loud but feeble crack hitting the ground, whereupon the donkey once again stirs up its flagging spirit and moves forward more quickly. Thus, another burst of dust flies up and billows like surging angry waves.</p>
<p>The wheels always seem too clumsy, and their movement is extremely slow. Their rumbling turning humorously symbolizes the advancement of Northwest culture.</p>

<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>A friend told me a story about an exile, which I thought was worth writing down丨丨丨</p>
<p>(After being exiled to the desolate island of Riku, my young, dark-faced friend 丨丨丨丨 Sumaleng and I lived in two completely different worlds, and we haven't heard from each other since.</p>
<p>(But, you know: I can't forget him.</p>
<p>(In the winter of 1930, I was unemployed in Shanghai, living a very miserable life for some time. After receiving an invitation from a Dutch ×× newspaper, I immediately went there and started my life as a journalist. On my first day at work, someone warned me: this is an imperialist colony, and freedom of speech is very restricted. I already had a fairly clear understanding of the faces of imperialists; however, it was more than two months after living in this temple that I was directly threatened and imprisoned for a piece of writing.</p>
<p>(A month in prison was really hard to get through! By chance, I met Sumaleng here. 丨丨丨 At that time, he was the editor-in-chief of a Malay newspaper and had also gotten into trouble because of his writing. If it weren't for him, just dealing with the prison guards would have been enough to annoy me to death. Because at that time, I couldn't speak a word of Malay. Fortunately, Sumaleng was able to do a lot of work for me; moreover, his English was more fluent than mine, and his attitude was so humble, so we became good friends in less than two days.</p>
<p>(He once told me this:</p>
<p>(丨丨This is my second time in jail.</p>
<p>(丨丨丨Oh... how long?</p>
<p>(I asked, throwing away the half-inch long cigarette butt. Sumaleng stretched out his slightly rough, dark fingers and smiled bitterly at me. I asked him how many days he had left, and he replied:</p>
<p>(丨Almost full, just over two months left.</p>
<p>(Naturally, I quickly left prison and returned to the newspaper office alone. By the time Sumaleng came out, the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai was becoming more and more intense, and it was also shaking up the rulers in the South Seas! Our freedom of speech was restricted, and our telegrams were strictly censored! But Sumaleng's newspaper bravely exposed the brutal face of Japanese imperialism! When he saw me, he always shouted:</p>
<p>(丨丨丨Roar, China!</p>
<p>(Touched by his enthusiasm, I often felt ashamed of my cowardice as a Chinese. When he was happy, he also frankly said to me:</p>
<p>(丨丨丨Friend, I can tell you, I have a great mission on my shoulders. What are you afraid of! Shouldn't young people be braver? Hearing about your heroic resistance, I will be even more excited. You can also see the situation of our oppression, right? You are also on our side, right? We should join hands!</p>
<p>(He spoke so earnestly and forcefully. As a fighter for the liberation of the weak and oppressed, Sumaleng is worthy of admiration...</p>
<p>(However, not long after, I heard that he had been arrested again. 丨丨This is the third time, and the situation is even more serious; the newspapers only mentioned it lightly. I went to the political department (where Sumaleng was being held) several times to see him, but I was not allowed. I returned with disappointment and indignation, clenching my teeth; but what could I do?</p>
<p>(A month later, without letting me see him again, Sumaleng was taken to the customs wharf and decided to be exiled to the remote and desolate island of Riku.</p>
<p>(Not long after, I resigned. I left ×× without any reluctance. I can't forget the young fighter who was exiled to the isolated island. ...)</p>
<p>I believe that even in colonies, under the strong pressure of warships, armored vehicles, airplanes, and bombs, there are clear-headed people who are active. I sympathize with those poor, exploited people. For more than ten years, I have watched how the rulers use soft and hard tactics on millions of people. Now, I have written down the story of my friend, 丨丨This is a story that is not yet finished. Sumaleng's future is long. Who dares to say that it is over just because he was exiled to a deserted island?</p>

<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>(Hmph! Two months.) Kaiyang Hemp Skin doesn't believe it. (The situation outside is unstable, there are wars everywhere; the people outside are almost wiped out, and now they want us to go and fight. The notice says two months, will they really let us back in two months? Isn't that just a fart, you won't be able to find it anywhere in a while.)</p>
<p>(Thinking about it, in the countryside, you don't even need to farm the fields anymore.) Shoufu Cannon felt sentimental, as if he foresaw his fate. (It's better to go to Shanghai to work. If you work in Shanghai, you won't be drafted, and you can earn a lot of money.)</p>
<p>(Joke, joke.) Winterlife Cripple turned around this time and sat on the wooden strip under the notice, resting his left foot on his right foot and shaking it continuously. (What kind of work is there to do outside? Opening a public stove requires capital, being a waiter requires a security deposit. Factory work is unbearable. Yunsheng Crooked Mouth worked in a cotton mill for three years, vomited blood, and returned to his hometown. Isn't Sister-in-law Ajin's son Xiaolin beaten on his skin until he can't even bring his bones back home丨丨What kind of work is there to do outside? And, and Sheng Tu's son, crushed to death by a car on the main road! Country folks, stupid and clumsy, also want to go to Shanghai... Joke, joke!)</p>
<p>(You always say the same thing.) Mu Ren Lao shook his unfractured right leg. (Since ancient times, boatmen help boatmen, water helps water. When you eat the government's food, you always speak the government's words. You always want all seventy-two draftees, not leaving a single one, one by one falling into your trap.)</p>
<p>(Big Foot Crazy is crazy himself. He's really a mad dog, how can he bite me?) Winterlife Cripple and Mu Ren Big Foot Crazy sit facing each other, their words are on point, and even their disabilities are equal. (You're not a draftee, and I'm not a draftee, who cares about an egg. But since the superiors have said it, they have to do it.)</p>
<p>Dao Gou couldn't think of anything to say. He stood there blankly, watching, although he felt strange and depressed.</p>
<p>(That's also right.) A Zhao was a little sympathetic to Winterlife Cripple. (They say that if the countryside drafts draftees, Shanghai won't. That's not necessarily true. Big Lai Ge works as a sailor on a boat. Didn't they take the boat away that year because they wanted to recruit soldiers, and they insisted on taking Big Lai Ge? They sent them to the fiery place. A soldier kicked Big Lai Ge in the balls and damaged his spirit. Didn't he die three days later? Let's not even talk about that. The year before last, there was a big war in Shanghai. Asheng worked in a Dongyang cotton mill, and when work stopped, he became a volunteer soldier. Didn't he die in some thief's north? When there's a war, if you don't become a soldier, you'll die; if you become a soldier, you'll also die. Since you're going to die anyway, it's better to learn and see, learn a little marksmanship, learn a little martial arts, and at least do something.)</p>
<p>Mu Ren Lao closed his eyes and thought for a while, feeling that A Zhao's words made some sense. Times are chaotic, and the lives of people in the countryside are not peaceful either. In the Geng year of the Xianfeng era, the old people said that there were also Longhairs making trouble here. Later, before Xuantong even ascended the throne, in the thirty-third year of Guangxu, he himself had seen the Pingyang Party Wang Xitong attacking the church and killing those who ate church food. If Western straight-legged ghosts and Eastern dwarfs invade, maybe he will have to use his own big crazy foot as a sandalwood cannon.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Merchant Returns from the Road to the People, Saying Farewell to Yongshou; A Heavenly Being Arrives in Chang'an</p>
<p>It's not far to Little Western Heaven, there's a restaurant right there. They still used the old method: entering the shop, it's the kitchen, and only after passing through this kitchen do you reach the dining area. Under a large awning, there were ten or so tables, but it was clean. The two sat down, and Li Shilian said: I don't eat greasy things much, find something light to eat. Jia Duocai laughed: Let me state first that when eating dishes here, don't mention fish or duck, only duck and pork, which are very light, probably not even available. Li Shilian scratched his head and said: Then, you take care of ordering, I won't interfere. Jia Duocai was not polite and ordered the dishes himself. The shop assistant brought the wine pot, teacups, and chopsticks. Jia Duocai poured tea into the cup and laughed: Drinking this tea makes people not want to make a living in the Northwest. Li Shilian took the teacup and asked: Why is that? As he spoke, he picked up the cup and took a sip, smacking his lips a few times, and said: Is this water bad? I can't taste anything wrong with it. As he spoke, he picked it up and took another sip. Jia Duocai said: This water is the best water, there's nothing strange about it here, you don't need to taste it. How would you know? There are a total of 120,000 people in Xi'an city, all drinking water from a well inside the West Gate, carried in small buckets and pushed in small carts to deliver to users. It's fine if the distance is short, but if it's far, each bucket costs two or three dimes. Li Shilian said: Is there only this one well in the whole city? Jia Duocai said: Although there are wells, the water that comes out is muddy soup, not only can't you drink it, but you have to clarify it before you can wash clothes. We Southerners have water everywhere we go, but coming to this Northwest where water is used as treasure, it's really painful. You're only in Xi'an, you don't know the pain of having no water. If you were to go a few hundred miles west like me, you wouldn't even think about changing your palate by coming to the Northwest. Li Shilian said: I want to ask you, why are you going west? Jia Duocai laughed: That's going among the people. As he said this, the shop assistant brought the wine pot, cups, chopsticks, and a large plate of cold cuts. (26)</p>
<h3 id="e223">Dishevelled Hair and Left-Laid Lapel <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>It's not that I'm old-fashioned and criticizing modern people, but the scenery before my eyes coincides so cleverly with what was said in ancient times that I can't help but bring it up for everyone to smile at. You must know that I am only doing archeology and not showing off my learning.</p>
<p>The Analects says (If it weren't for Guan Zhong, we would all have dishevelled hair and left-laid lapels!) Dishevelled hair and left-laid lapels were the appearance of barbarians at that time, who knew that after more than two thousand years, they would be called the epitome of modern fashion. Look, don't modern women have their hair scattered, all covering below the collar? According to Zhu Xi's interpretation, the word (被, bei), should be read as (披, pi), which is even more in line with the current fashion of short hair. As for the left-laid lapel, it doesn't seem to have been achieved yet, but according to Wang Renqiu's diary, the Qing Dynasty's jackets and mandarin jackets were left-laid lapel. He said:</p>
<p>(Left-laid lapel should be a double-breasted garment, opening in the middle, without the need for buttons, and a belt can be added. Barbarians can mount horses quickly, and when wrapping clothes, whether stretched or bent, they can also add knots and wraps, all left-laid lapel. The barbarians are also left-laid lapel. Today, the mandarin jackets in the Northwest have small lapels in the middle, with the right lapel covering the left, which is a joint creation.)</p>
<p>This explanation is more thorough than Zhu Xi's, so the Republic of China's formal dress, using mandarin jackets, has already used barbarians to transform the Chinese. Those who wear Western suits can use this point as a talisman.</p>
<p>However, Confucius's left-laid lapel must have referred to barbarian men. How is it that now these two things are distributed between men and women?</p>
<p>I remember during the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, there was a rumor everywhere that they wanted to (overthrow the mandarin jacket,) and for a long time, mandarin jackets were not seen active in social circles. But now, when holding grand ceremonies, you can see long robes and short jackets jostling about. The other day at the Confucius ceremony in Qufu, no woman did not have dishevelled hair, and the men were all left-laid lapel. (Those who participated in the ceremony) don't know if Confucius saw it, would he sigh?</p>
<p>The New Life Movement prohibits women from perming their hair, but does not prohibit dishevelled hair. I think that looking like Wu Song on the stage is not only not beautiful, but also unclean. Although the Zhongshan suit is also evolved from Western suits, it is not left-laid lapel and is worth promoting. That wind collar button is not a genuine domestic product either, because before, they were all round collars or slanting lapels. So this account, I have to put aside and not talk about it.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Records of Fleeting Fragrance <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Now let me describe the details of these forty officials who came to the station to welcome the emperor: The first is the governor-general, Yuan Shikai, who has the power to command the armies of the entire Zhili province and Shandong and Henan provinces. Because he holds such strong power, he always stands in a leading position in name or in reality. Below him is the governor, who specializes in the civil administration of a province; the next is the treasurer (provincial treasurer), who is in charge of the province's finances: and then there is the judge (judicial commissioner) whose task is to specialize in hearing criminal cases within the province. Although these four are clearly designated to be in charge of the four different government affairs of the military, civil affairs, political law, and law, the boundaries of their powers and responsibilities are not clearly defined, and they can often interfere with or shirk each other's responsibilities. But these are beyond their control! In short, among these forty officials, these four can be regarded as the highest-ranking officials! Aside from them, the next in line would be the circuit intendants. At that time, each province was divided into several circuits, and each circuit had a presiding officer, which was called the circuit intendant. In terms of their official rank and status, they are similar to the mayors of today's special municipalities, but strictly speaking, they are completely different; because today's mayors often have direct contact with the people, the circuit intendants at that time absolutely disdained to consult on civil matters. They believed that the people were the most humble beings, and that if a high-ranking official were to directly contact the people, it would be a shameful thing. Therefore, they unloaded the responsibility of managing the people entirely on the state and county officials subordinate to them. Even if there were particularly diligent workers, they would only ask about a few of the more important matters.</p>
<p>Within Zhili Province, there were also seven officials of equal rank to the circuit intendant. Although there were seven of them, their tasks were very simple, generally just managing the small matter of minting silver coins, collectively known as the general managers of the mint. And this is not to say that they have any special research or experience in minting silver coins, so they are invited to guide or supervise them, but only because they want to be officials, their fathers, brothers, or relatives taught them to casually play a role.</p>
<p>Among these officials, there were two even more special ones, one called the Monk Registrar, and the other called the Taoist Registrar. Their positions were also equal to the circuit intendant; but their tasks were similar to those of foreign bishops. All they managed were temples and monks and Taoists. (136)</p>

<p>Giving up a seat on the streetcar is originally a foreign custom. In principle, it is also a kind of courtesy from men to women; but when you see a woman carrying a lot of things, or holding a child on the streetcar, and you stand up to offer her a seat, but the woman doesn't even say thank you, but seems to accept it as a matter of course and sits down silently, where is the woman's courtesy then?</p>

<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>There are really many swindlers in Shanghai now, and the swindling techniques are becoming more and more strange. If you are a little careless, you will fall for their tricks. Even if you don't leave your house, someone will come to visit. They think of ways to extract money from your pocket. In particular, residents with (For Rent) signs are their target, and you must pay extra attention. The following is a true account of a neighbor's, the × family, being swindled!</p>
<p>The × family recently had a spare room for rent, so they put up a (For Rent) sign on the door. Early in the morning the other day, two neatly dressed men, A and B, came to see the room. They seemed very pleased with it, and the monthly rent was also agreed upon. According to the custom, a deposit of three dollars had to be paid first, and A took out a ten-dollar bill from the ×× bank to ask for change. The × family host looked at it again and again, saying it was good, and gave him seven dollars in change. Just as the two were about to leave, A pointed and said: A wooden stove should be arranged next to the terrace, and a pair of couches should be placed next to the railing. At this point, the second landlord did not agree. After arguing with the two for a long time, they finally broke up and returned the bill. A held it in his hand, about to return the seven dollars. B suddenly advised from the side, saying: We are very pleased with this house, it is a pity to abandon it. Why don't we accommodate it, we will find another way for those things. At this time, the second landlord was a little reluctant, and seeing them soften, he said it was very good. So the bill in A's hand was handed over again, and the date of moving in was explained, and the two of them left. The host looked at the bill again and found that it had become a fake bill. It turned out that in a moment of transfer, the real one had been switched. Realizing this, he sent someone to chase after them, but the two had already flown away like wild geese, their whereabouts unknown.</p>
<p>The second landlady ran out and said hatefully to the For Rent sign: I posted a For Rent sign, but I called in two swindlers, what real bad luck. After saying that, she tore the For Rent sign into pieces that flew away like butterflies.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Thoughts on Japanese-Manchurian Enterprises (Part 1) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Reading the section (Investigation of Japanese Intrusion into Newly Established Enterprises in Northern Manchuria) published in the September 16th issue of Shen Bao, it mentions the first type of enterprise, namely the No. 1 and No. 2 flour mills, working day and night, producing as many as 3,200 bags per day, still thinking it is not enough, and in June of this year, the No. 3 plant was combined in Suihua, and on July 24, it began operating, producing 1,500 bags of flour per day, which can be said to be the ultimate prosperity. But its capital is only 2 million yuan. Since the Mitsui and Mitsubishi business groups are the investment center, and there are shares from the Japanese-established flour milling company and funds from the pseudo-Central Bank: it is of course easy to set it up immediately, which is not surprising. The flour milling industry, like our country's flour mills, absorbs agricultural products for large-scale production, which can make people use their talents and the land yield its resources. Our country has always valued agriculture and industry, and many flour mills have already been established. However, the raw materials they need, domestically produced ones are often too small in quantity and too high in price, so they take the convenience of foreign ones being cheaper, and choose to use them, and agricultural crops become more and more passive. A major crux of this is that tariffs have lost their control. If imported rice and wheat were taxed like alcohol, the tax rate would be equal to the selling price of locally produced liquor, it would of course be possible to avoid the adulteration of fire liquor with water to avoid the disadvantages of local liquor, and there would also be the possibility of self-producing alcohol in the country, because the raw materials for alcohol are also agricultural products. In addition to flour milling, the Japanese also set up an alcohol factory in Harbin with a capital of 1.67 million yuan, with the aim of using the abundant sorghum and saying that they are studying other crops, then rice wine, wheat wine, and sweet potatoes, grains, sugar cane, etc., will inevitably be readily available. This is the same as my proposed (Four People Relief Company) plan. If we want our country to be rich and strong, we must first value agriculture, and ensure that the income from farming can avoid hunger and cold, and avoid being hungry, so that they will not abandon their fields and flock to the cities, so that the vast fields will be desolate! Only when prices fluctuate, working hard all year round, and yet not being able to be full and warm, and even water and drought disasters come together, they abandon their plows and take risks, which is also a matter of urgency. Since silk is worthless, cutting down mulberry trees to plant other crops has also become a trend, just like a leaky boat in a big storm, crying to the sky, the disaster of sinking is just around the corner. In my opinion, there is only one way to save us from danger, that is, the captain should order us to quickly combine our efforts to plug the leak, so that foreign water cannot flood in in large quantities, and also order the boatmen to work desperately to accelerate the rate, and hope to reach the other shore. At this time of plugging the leak, any sacrifice will be spared. Rather than everyone on the same boat being submerged, it is better to sacrifice everything and fight with death, because this boat is just leaking, and has not yet reached the point of complete rupture. If we do not panic and abandon our sails and oars and cry like Chu people, there is still a way to remedy the situation. The so-called sails and oars are like plows. Now abandoning plows and seeking machinery is like trying to change a leaky boat into a steamship to increase speed. Even if there is a possibility of really changing it into a steamship in an instant, the sailors can immediately lose their jobs and stand idly by. However, the leak is not plugged, and it is already certain that its success will lead to the same demise. Therefore, I believe that the strategy for saving the country is to quickly plug the leak, and use tariffs as a barrier, which is just like the Yellow River's water control. On the one hand, we must build strong dikes to avoid being washed away, and on the other hand, we must do our best in ditches, unblocking what has been blocked, and restoring what has been abandoned. Most of them have remnants of past achievements, but if two people are paired together, working together, and cutting one foot wide and one foot deep, then there are tens of millions of people working together in the ditches at the same time, drawing a picture of entering the river and pouring into the sea, its speed should be like marching, with four routes advancing troops, all heading in one direction, then guiding according to the situation, how can there be such an extremely opposite scene of drought here and floods there? After Yu leveled the water and soil, the Yellow River disaster has not stopped in China, precisely because after Yu's death, no one continued his work, and they specialized in enjoying the fruits, not knowing how to improve, and filling rivers to make land, reversing the predecessors' achievements as foolish, not only Gun alone. Just like after Hou Ji taught the people how to farm, everyone eats ready-made food, and among the four classes, the scholars rank first, not farming and eating, not weaving and wearing, everyone wants to be a scholar, and their children do not want to keep their industry for generations, and they all tend to the path of not working and getting results. If one acre of land has one less person farming it, its output will decrease and consumers will increase, the demand exceeds the supply, and prices will naturally rise. Those who do not farm or weave cannot but eat and wear, then measuring expenses to make income, they must seek their livelihood, so they sell foreign goods, to reap the fisherman's profit, and make foreigners and our people the protagonists of the snipe and clam conflict, which is what Mencius called a mean man.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Life and Survival <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Cheng</p>
<p>What is so-called "life" (Live) is a rare thing in the world; most people are merely surviving, but is simply surviving enough?</p>
<p>The 19th-century English writer Oscar Wilde explained the difference between "survival" and "life" very clearly. He said, "Most people are alive, and starvation is rare; however, simply living such an ordinary life is no different from the lives of birds and beasts. They have no conscious sense of what it means to 'live,' and cannot rightly be said to be enjoying the pleasures of 'life.'"</p>
<p>"Why do we grow up in this world after all?" Those who can answer this question simply are, in the end, a very small minority. Most people fall from their mother's womb into a dream; and they dream forever, even to the point of carrying their drowsy fantasies into the deep grave.</p>
<p>In this era of distress, the remaining forces of feudalism are constantly assailing the youth; the whip of life is cruelly lashing their backs; under the gray and hideous wings of the demon of money, they are forced to rashly step off the track of life and squeeze into the trap of survival.</p>
<p>What a terrible phenomenon!</p>
<p>We, as young people, if we are sensitive and perceptive, will certainly not mistakenly fall into the trap that dissolves our spirit and destroys our souls. However, when we step onto the path of life, we must still carefully observe: one path, relatively flat and leading to darkness, is the side road of survival; the other, rugged but with a glimmer of light, is the grand road of life.</p>
<p>I hope that we are not just objects existing in the world. Nor should we betray our conscience and sell our souls.</p>
<p>I hope that we can bravely and resolutely follow on the path of life, that great tide of history, which is flooding and preparing to destroy everything, forging a bloody path to life, and becoming extraordinary people.</p>
<p>I know that most numb people still survive like objects.</p>
<p>I know that some young people are still wandering on the side roads of life.</p>

<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>Sitting on the train, I regretted that I should not have made this trip. There was a time when I could say that I was living a train life, but now I get a headache as soon as I see the station. The reason is that I can't even explain it myself, or maybe I just don't need to take the train now.</p>
<p>The train was delayed by twenty minutes from the scheduled time. We don't have to ask for the reason. It is said that on the northern line, it is not uncommon for trains to be derailed for three to five days, and passengers don't find it strange. However, those who are on the train every day don't seem to notice this. In these twenty minutes, I wanted to get off the train several times, and the passengers in the car showed signs of anxiety when the bell rang.</p>
<p>The day is the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Many companions are carrying large packages and small items to go home. I secretly laugh to myself. I wanted to leave a week ago, but it happened to coincide with this joyous festival of family reunion. So I thought of my home, my home deep in the white clouds!</p>
<p>Counting the days, it has been a full eight years since I left my hometown and drifted alone outside. When the signs of autumn sales fluttered in the dreary wind and rain, I realized that my wandering life had increased by another year, which was the ×th anniversary of my departure from my hometown. My old mother, my wife, and my newborn child, who should be nine years old now, must be looking forward to my return day and night. I received a letter from my hometown earlier this year, saying that if I had enough travel expenses for the journey, I should go home once! After receiving this letter, I cried all night. I seemed to see my old mother leaning on the door with a wooden cane, her silvery white hair being blown by the southern wind, which made people think of a kind of discordant feeling; my wife, my child, maybe even if I go back, they won't recognize their husband and father!</p>
<p>Far away, far away, my home on the shores of the South!</p>
<p>The train howled and stopped at every pier. It carried many wanderers to the bosom of their loving mothers; to the bosom of their wives. I wanted to find a companion in this carriage who, like me, had a home but could not return. We would cry loudly to commemorate our Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>But the carriage was full of smiling faces. They were going home, to such a sweet home, with old mothers, wives, and children. I asked myself why I didn't go back? Don't I have enough money for a one-way ticket? I didn't answer, because the answer couldn't even satisfy myself, that I couldn't go back to that home.</p>
<p>"(Lifting my head, I gaze at the bright moon; lowering my head, I think of my hometown)." Which poet wrote such lines? I unintentionally recalled these two lines of poetry, and cursed the author of the poem. Angrily, I withdrew my gaze from reality and turned it to the corner of the carriage. I saw a child holding a big mooncake and asking his father to share it with him. Speaking of mooncakes, they are the most famous in my hometown. Now the Cantonese-style mooncakes on Nanjing Road are already on sale at reduced prices. Shanghai people seem to pay special attention to eating. They like to eat local specialties. In fact, after eating the mooncakes from our hometown, these Shanghai "Cantonese-style" mooncakes are no longer authentic. Mooncakes are a common food in my hometown, but in this big city, they are used to decorate the good times and festivals. What's the reason for eating mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival? Can the reunion fill the void in my heart?</p>
<p>The train passed through many piers, and the passengers in the carriage gradually thinned out. I hoped that when I reached the end point, I would be the only one left. So I picked up my worn-out suitcase, stepped off the train with the appearance of returning home, and stepped onto the station platform. Who knows that my home is on the distant shores of the South?</p>

<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>One day, I read such an advertisement in the newspaper: "Airplane tickets for this period can still be publicly researched, implemented according to law, and guaranteed to win. Regardless of whether you have already purchased them or not, or if you have purchased tickets multiple times without winning, please cut out this advertisement and send it by registered mail. All tests are free (the tests may be free, but the registration fee is naturally not 丨丨Yun's own note). After winning, a reward will be taken.

<p>Someone said: "The minds of Chinese people are very foolish, so many scientific inventions have to be left to foreigners." But how can it be like this? I think the minds of Chinese people are intelligent, clever, and transcendent. As long as you open your eyes and look at the advertisement for "The Secret Method for Obtaining Airplane Tickets," you can know that the airplane lottery tickets have only been opened for seven periods, and someone has actually researched the "secret method" to "guarantee winning." Compared with the "Airplane Lottery Ticket Purchase Method" published by a certain bookstore, this kind of clever intelligence, I am afraid that the foreign devils who invented science will also be stunned when they hear about it. However, the clever minds of Chinese people have never been willing to easily use it in science, but are willing to focus on this kind of thing. I remember that I used to meet a certain professor in a long black and blue cloth gown at the Jai Alai stadium every night, gambling until his face was red and his ears were hot. It is said that he was also researching the gambling method of Jai Alai. Unfortunately, this book has not been published until now. Otherwise, it could be compared with ("Airplane Secret Method") and ("With Secret Method") to form a triumvirate, benefiting the people!</p>
<p>The secret-keeping mentality of Chinese people is originally very strong. It is said that many good prescriptions of Bian Que and Hua Tuo, and many amazing boxing skills of the Shaolin Temple, were lost because they were kept too secret. Nowadays, many generations of famous doctors do not keep their ancestral prescriptions as if they were treasures, for fear of being discovered. Then, the inventor of this "Airplane Lottery Ticket Purchase Method" and the researcher of "The Secret Method for Obtaining Airplane Tickets," since he has researched the "guaranteed winning" method himself, wouldn't he go buy the tickets himself? Is he not afraid that other people will compete with him for the first prize of 500,000? I really don't quite understand whether they have really seen through the vulgarity and (regard wealth and nobility as floating clouds), don't want to become rich themselves, but are willing to travel around and calculate horoscopes for others for life?</p>
<p>This is just like the feng shui master who runs around in the mountains all day long, year after year, looking for good burial spots for people, and says to the landlord with oily mouth and slick tongue: "This dragon burial spot is so beautiful, burying it will guarantee wealth and glory." If it is really as he says, why doesn't he bury the bodies of his parents in there, so that he can go (wealth and glory) himself? The same question arises.</p>
<p>In this way, the secret method for obtaining airplane tickets can only be laughed at.</p>

<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Oh, the walking stick women! As soon as I see every man on the street with a woman's arm hooked on his arm, with the same posture as hanging a walking stick, I can't help but shout in my heart.</p>
<p>Wherever I go, I have never seen a woman not hanging on a man's arm, tightly缠住 as if rooted, like ivy纏住 the wall. If she leaves even a little, she will not be able to stand steadily and will fall to the side. Therefore, she cannot leave the man's arm all day long, and always needs the man to hook her arm. When she leaves, she will be uneasy, feel lonely, and feel like a walking stick abandoned by its owner, lonely for no reason.</p>
<p>Women's walking sticks! In movie theaters and dance halls, women are even more like walking sticks, and they must have a man holding their arm as a guarantee. Then they laugh嘻嘻, as if to say, "I have a protector, I have an owner."</p>
<p>Walking sticks are inanimate, but women are animate and have a walking stick feeling. Hanging an inanimate walking stick is naturally more real than hanging a woman with an animate walking stick feeling, but the effect given to the person who is hanging is the same as the effect of a walking stick.</p>
<p>However, wandering loners prefer walking sticks without reality, and sometimes see them as more intimate than women with a walking stick feeling. This is because they are light and easy to carry on the street. They are not tiring at all, while women have the tiredness that walking sticks do not have. Moreover, women with a walking stick feeling are alive, they will be capricious and gluttonous. They want to eat German food in the morning and buy expensive cosmetics in the afternoon. If something goes wrong, they will hang on someone else's arm. Therefore, hanging on a woman with a walking stick feeling is time-sensitive with material ups and downs, so it is better to hang on a real walking stick, which is comfortable, without danger, and without worrying about its resistance.</p>
<p>There is a reason why loners prefer inanimate walking sticks and despise animate walking sticks.</p>

<p>Bing! As I pick up my pen to write this letter, my heart is filled with boiling blood! My hands are shaking! In my deep-set eye sockets, full of bloody tears, they are about to flow down with the tip of my pen!</p>

<h3 id="e234">Mountain <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>There are no mountains here; where did the mountains go?</p>
<p>(The mountain was submerged in silver-white waves, and the turbulent waves sent it to the other side of the sea).</p>
<p>The mountain that accompanied our first love is not here!</p>
<p>I told Bing, who was on the other side of the sea, this sad news; then she comforted me and said:</p>
<p>It's good that there are no mountains, this can reduce the stimulation of your bitter memories, right?</p>
<p>However, although the shape of the mountain can no longer be found in this city; the memory it left in my lonely heart has not been blurred. Whenever the setting sun sinks in the west and the wilderness is vast, I wander alone on the grass. I painfully dream a daytime dream: I dream of the green mountain, and our green first love.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of this year, one early spring afternoon, Xiao Qiu first imprinted our footprints. At that time, the mountain was covered with a layer of light green, faint, the same color as the clothes Bing was wearing, reflecting each other. Thus, this green became the symbol of our first love.</p>
<p>However, a few months passed so briefly, and everything disappeared with it! The mountain had not yet begun to fade its green; and the joy of our reunion was replaced by the sorrow of a distant departure! And she? Now even the last attachment that the mountain gave us has become a painful memory of illusion:</p>
<p>It was a mid-summer evening, and we were sitting on the top of Xiao Qiu as usual; the strong smell of green grass all around coldly penetrated into our nostrils, and a lost mood, like an insect, crawled up and down in our hearts.</p>
<p>Bing held my hand that I had reached out to her, raised her head and looked up at a few light red floating clouds, and said slowly, heavily:</p>
<p>Go, Xing! For the future.</p>
<p>I stared at her face facing the sky from the side, and some fluid was moving on the surface of her eyes. I felt a sour hardness in my teeth, so I also raised my head and silently looked at the gray sky.</p>
<p>The evening tide wind blew from the opposite bay, and my heart was as vague and ethereal as the wind!</p>
<p>It's getting dark: the light red of the floating clouds turned gray.</p>
<p>Let's go back, it's getting late.</p>
<p>I shook Bing's stiff body and stood up wordlessly. From the top of Xiao Qiu, taking slow steps, along the small road that had imprinted thousands of our footprints, when we returned to the foot of the mountain. Bing looked back at the Xiao Qiu protruding in the vast atmosphere, slumped on my shoulder, unable to hold back the depression and sadness, sobbing and saying:</p>
<p>Xiao Qiu after this······?</p>
<p>Now, there are no mountains here: where did the mountains go?</p>
<p>(The turbulent waves sent the mountain to the other side of the sea.)</p>
<h3 id="e235">Autumn Heart <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Superman</p>
<p>After a few days of drizzle, autumn slipped across the treetops.</p>
<p>The wind of September brings the cool smell of autumn, white clouds wander in the pale blue sky, and the cicadas sing their unfallen funeral song in a desolate voice. The coolness has begun to fill the world, and the phoenix leaves are fluttering one by one, and the flame-like summer has melted away.</p>
<p>A kind of intoxication scattered on the ripe grape trellis warmly permeates the air and dominates people's souls: but the withered bitter lotus and the grass about to turn yellow by the pond weave a layer of thin new sorrow.</p>
<p>Autumn is here again, ah, the heart of the wanderer!</p>
<p>In the city, autumn also puts on her conscious veil.</p>
<p>The ladies are trying on newly made fashions, and the silk stocking shops may have increased some business; although there are still people trying cold drinks occasionally, the warm lily soup is ultimately welcomed by the times; the autumn sun softly dyes the platform where potted flowers are placed, men think of the maple leaves outside the city, and slaves are busy wiping the new guns bought by their masters.</p>
<p>The autumn moon surges out with crystal clear plain color,泻 on the treetops on the sidewalk on the street, leaking sparse broken shadows, the houses on both sides, one by one, close their shutters, and some reveal silk-like lights, and the lovers in the lights snuggled together especially tightly.</p>
<p>What is left on the street is only silence and desolation, the wind blows through the dark night, rolling up dead leaves and dust, and how many homeless wanderers are dotted in the wind and dew.</p>
<p>The consciousness of autumn is spinning on the felt hats of gentlemen, and wanderers think of the clothes kept in the usury shops.</p>
<p>Autumn is here again, ah, the heart of the wanderer!</p>
<p>The roar of machinery is rumbling on the edge of the earth, where there is no day and night, no health, health is rolled away by wheels and belts, and suffocating air constantly falls on the hair, they do not know what autumn is, steel and coal smoke replace the entire life, and each of them is deeply etched with forehead wrinkles by the hellish life.</p>
<p>For many years, there have been no ripe fields, and the land is full of desolation. Man-made disasters and natural disasters have swept through time and time again, and wars have ravaged repeatedly. The proper field tax has been levied for decades to come. The great foreign forces are indirectly and deeply invading. The farmers are ultimately left with nothing. The only property they have left, their bodies, are also getting lighter and lighter every day. Autumn loses her lyrical function for this hungry and cold group, and the autumn wind and autumn rain bring them death. They are waiting to die, and some are taking separate paths.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Another Opinion on Going to the Northwest <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>The September 18th issue published Mr. Zhou Wei Zhi's (The Prerequisites for Going to the Northwest). First (how do you go), second (how do you live after you go). In my opinion, these two questions do not seem to be prerequisites. The prerequisite is why the slogan (going to the Northwest) was generated. Because of the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of various industries in the city, tens of thousands of unemployed people were created. But will the countryside go bankrupt for no reason? Will the city decline for no reason? No, this is entirely due to the economic invasion of imperialism, the chaos of domestic politics, and other natural and man-made disasters; generally, young people think that there is no way out under such circumstances, and they can only go to the border areas to find another way out, so the slogan (going to the Northwest) was generated. But I think it is not only difficult for young people to find a way out there, but also fundamentally wrong. For example, if you can get there, can you guarantee that the rural Northwest will not go bankrupt? Will the various industries in the city not decline? No one can guarantee this. Because under the trend of the powers' economic invasion and division of China, China's economic lifeline is completely in their hands. Since the cities and rural areas in the mainland of China have been created by them in such a situation, then won't the border areas also be the same as the mainland, and also go bankrupt and decline?</p>
<p>I think that in the current environment, going to the Northwest is like a fire in your own house, escaping to the neighbor's house, without wanting to put it out, and without wanting to go back to your own house to get anything. You just run to the neighbor's house, without thinking that if the fire is not put out, it will slowly spread over. Therefore, young people thinking of going to the Northwest to make a living can be said to be fearing difficulties and seeking temporary safety, and avoiding the responsibilities they should bear. I think young people should take responsibility and find ways to eliminate this terrible flame that can spread: how to prevent the countryside from going bankrupt? How to prevent various industries from declining and reducing unemployment? These are our prerequisites. Then you can reconsider the conditions that Mr. Zhou said (how do you go) and (how do you live after you go), and find ways to go to the Northwest.</p>
<p>Li Jun September 21st</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since we published Mr. Zhou Weizhi's article (The Prerequisites for Going to the Northwest), we have received letters from several readers discussing it, which shows everyone's enthusiasm for studying realistic issues. The editor has decided to publish these letters one after another for the public to explore.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Uncle's Braid (16) <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Ming bone world? What is the Ming bone world? This is something everyone doesn't understand. However, after the restoration, there was a revolution, and after the revolution, braids had to be cut. Sixth Grandpa understood this very well, so he couldn't help but touch his own small white braid, and couldn't help but say with some worry:</p>
<p>Third Master, I heard that in today's Ming bone world, braids must be cut, is that right?</p>
<p>Of course, look, I don't have a braid. Civilized people don't have braids.</p>
<p>Third Master had been to a foreign school after all, so he was a famous person, so he had to cut his braid. But First Master was also very famous, who doesn't know about Mr. Xu Zhai in our Big Field Stomach? Why does he still keep his braid? But maybe it's because he hasn't had a revolution yet? Sixth Grandpa secretly thought: He wasn't a famous person, so he could always keep this white braid and take it to the coffin. So he was very happy, and he said loudly:</p>
<p>Then we're all okay, we're not famous people!</p>
<p>Hearing what Sixth Grandpa said, everyone felt it made a lot of sense, and couldn't help but feel much relieved. Only Oldest Mao didn't think so. He thought that although he had never been famous, it would be good to cut his braid, at least when grinding tofu in the morning, his hair wouldn't be soaked in sweat, but he still didn't want to cut it off, he said:</p>
<p>Who wouldn't like to cut off their braid, but now we don't know whose world it is. If we cut it off now, and the Ming bone world doesn't become successful, and it becomes Emperor Xuantong's world again, then that would be terrible. Cutting off your braid is like killing your head.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he felt his wife touch his back, so he immediately realized that he had said the wrong thing; hadn't Third Master cut his braid? So he quickly said back:</p>
<p>But of course Third Master knows we're different, you've been to a foreign school, you've seen more of the world than us, you wouldn't be wrong to do anything······</p>
<p>Of course, the foreigner began to speak: You live in the countryside all year round, so you naturally don't know what's happening outside. This time the revolutionaries are rising up, you have to know that it's to destroy the Qing Dynasty and transform it into the Republic. The Republic means no emperor, transforming into a people's country. In the past, it was an autocratic country, now it's a democratic country, so it's called the Republic. The Republic requires cutting off braids. As for saying that we can't determine which side's world it is now, then the Qing Dynasty is definitely doomed. Now which province isn't responding to the revolutionaries? The Qing Dynasty is only relying on Yuan Shikai, but Yuan Shikai is advocating negotiating peace with the revolutionaries. So you see, what can the Qing Dynasty do?</p>
