<h3 id="c1">錢塘江大橋開工誌喜廷 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>錢塘江江面遼闊。潮流洶湧。河底積沙。變遷無定。民元以來。建橋計劃屢議屢輟。卽因工程浩大。着手綦難。而經費籌劃。亦正匪易。歷屆掌浙省之建設行政者。又往往以時局多變。未遑終於其事。建橋之議。遂更延緩。直至曾養甫氏出長建廳。始將舊事重提。一方面網羅專家。悉心研究。一方面籌措經費。積極奔走。歴經波折。方獲就緒。吾人以該橋關係之重大。嘗著專論。促其實現。當茲舉行開工典禮之日。深幸夙願得償。欣慰無旣。</p>
<p>築橋工程處處長茅以昇氏嘗曰。今次錢塘江建橋之主要目的有三。（一）使杭江鐡路直達杭州。並通上海爲出口。（二）使滬杭鐡路自杭州展至百官。完成綫路。三使浙東浙西公路路棧連接貫通。凡此所述。悉爲事實。而逈非時下空談建設者可比。吾人因樂爲引申其意。</p>
<p>（一）按浙省夙有東南膏腴之目。因受天然形勢之支配。而有浙東浙西之分。浙東金衢一帶。水流湍急。山嶺環繞。民風固陋。交通阻梗。乃築杭州鐡路。以資補救。該路現已築至江西玉山。以便贛浙商旅。不久且將由玉山西延。至於南昌萍鄕。與南潯株萍兩路分别接軌。以爲溝通粤漢鐡路之先聲。（玉萍路借欵一千六百萬元。最近甫經簽字。全數限二十四年底交淸。南玉段卽於是時完竣通車。而粤漢平漢兩路之接軌辦法。亦在鐡道部嚴密計劃中。）一旦錢江大橋告成。復可與京滬滬杭甬兩路相聯絡。接通津浦。而形成東南系統中之幹綫。至是湘粤贛浙四省之貨物行旅。悉可利用鐡路而直達上海。其有補於國民經濟者。殊非淺鮮也。</p>
<p>（二）滬杭甬鐡路通車營業。已廿有餘年。獨中隔杭縣至曹娥一段。未曾興築。致與浙西及腹地各省之往來。或須由海運繞道上海。或須由内河繞道紹興。不惟經濟時間多所耗費。卽滬杭間之運輸事業。亦受無形之影響。至甬曹間之一段。因孤立於系統之外而大受打繫。更可勿論。今錢江跨渡工程。已開始進行。而完成滬杭甬路之借欵合同。亦適經正式簽訂。此多年未决之兩大懸案。竟能同時解决。誠如中英銀公司年會報告書所言。「今後該路進欵之激增。自在意中」也。再者。爲京滬滬杭甬兩路連鎖之蘇（州）嘉（興）段鐡路支缐。亦定年内動工。嗣後滬杭甬路杭甬段之沿線土産。更可利用錢江大橋及蘇嘉段支線而輸往華北華中諸省。旣省時間。又免擁擠。其裨益爲何如乎。（三）浙省已通車之公路。已有三千四百公里。預擬之公路計劃。大致可謂完成。惟浙東浙西之公路。因有錢江之隔。而自成段落。不易聯貫。實可遺　。再如京閩路自杭州達福建之一段。滬桂路自杭州達江西之一段。皆爲東南各省公路公通之樞紐。且經劃入東南七省公路段線之内。其關係之重要。更非常綫可比。設無錢江大橋之聯絡。勢將首尾隔絶。而使全國公路交通計劃。爲之减色。自滬杭與京杭國道勇車後。杭州一隅已爲我國東南公路網之一重心。吾人誠欲利用杭州已有之優越地位。以完成七省公路之系統。自非先行建築錢江大橋不爲功也。</p>
<p>此外吾人所引爲欣幸者。則爲此次築橋經費之籌集。聞經費總額四百萬元。由鐡道部與浙省建設廳平等負擔。鐡道部方面之二百萬元。由中英銀公司及國人自辦之建設銀公司組織銀團。共同投資。而利息特低。（聞以前借欵均爲六厘或七厘。而此次僅爲五厘有半。）則因年來京滬滬杭甬兩路整理路政成績卓著。故銀團方面樂於投資也。至於浙省建設廳方面之二百萬元。則完全由滬市銀行團承借。其贊助之熱烈。頗與往者籌集杭江鐡路經費時相彷彿。據此二端。足見今日中外社會對於我國國營事業之信仰。皆遠過於前。諺云。「天下無難事。只怕有心人。」錢江大橋之完成。可爲今後政府機關進行建設事業之借鏡也已。</p>

<p>臨時議會、遲延復遲延、到五日纔决定於十一月廿七日召集、其集會期雖短、但不免發生多少問題、當前最主要的、（一）是政友會反對加稅、（二）是民政黨總裁若槻禮次郎辭職、現在日本的財政情形祇有一面加稅、一面發公債、不過增加的租稅、無論怎樣、很難超出一萬五千萬圓以上、要塡補軍事還是不可能、這是財政當局所最苦心、也是金融资本·産業資本所躊躇的難事、何况對外輸出貿易的繁榮、今年秋後英國荷蘭美國大加輸入限制的結果、究竟怎樣、是没有把握的、假如對外貿易稍微受點挫折、如德意志現時情况、則經濟前途很可憂慮、並且農村經濟的基礎已經摇動了、其反映於都市相當嚴重、所以産業界有識者是不敢樂觀的、然而政治上、議會政治在日本已衰老了、恐怕再没有活的餘地、政友會擁有二百九十一頭議員、非特不能以絶對多數議席、控制議院、實行組閣、並且連有力的言論也没有、一般國民對於政黨並不熱誠擁護、甚至顯示　意、民政黨所占議席數僅一百十九、自然更不能　所作爲、當這種緊急關頭、拿不出出有力而可以實行的政策來喚起其國民、自然祇有衰落之一途、若槻禮次郎並不是不勝任太平時候的政黨總裁、現在竟於臨時議會開會之前夕辭職、這裏雖包含得有種種人事上黨務上的矛盾、最大的還是表現出政黨的軟弱無能、由此也就反映出將來臨時議會開會將有多大的結果了、恐怕上述這些問題、在議會當中、最多也祇是作幾次口舌鬥爭、實際問題的决定、還是後來在槍尖上去求解答罷、（十一月六日於東京）</p>

<p>河浚治完成、即將通航、築路問題、省府與膠濟路局商定、　由省府價買膠濟路舊材料、令建設廳修築、計劃大致完備、俟省府籌備妥當、並經省府政務會議通過、建設廳即派人測量、明春可以動工、茲將此事經過分述如次、</p>
<p>膠濟鐡路歷年換下材料甚多、橋梁枕木等等以外、鋼軌前爲六十磅者、今均換爲八十磅、於是舊材料積存沿路材料廠、膠濟路局、去年曾擬利用此項材料、將膠濟路延長至河南道口、與道淸路接軌、吸收西北物産、由膠濟路出口、繁榮山東、並已派員測量一次第一步擬先修至臨淸、　因需費太多、遲遲未能實現、加以膠濟路局現擬每年將盈餘存儲、以備十五年期滿、向日人贖回膠濟路、對於延長路線問題、因而擱淺、此項材料、遂無用處、本年又擬售與杭江鐡路亦未成事實、膠濟路委員崔士傑、乃提議將舊材料售與省府、俾省府修築濟南至聊城鐡路、膠濟路委員長葛光庭、亦甚贊同、崔最近曾來濟謁韓、陳述此意、韓遂與建設廳長張鴻烈研究、認爲可行、日前蔣委員長來濟、韓於報告軍政事務之外、亦將此意申述、並請示辦法、蔣謂省府可以條築、故此事至現在、已具體化、但省府正在縝密研究進行耳、</p>

<p>西北視察記</p>
<p>安西農村概况</p>
<p>安西雖孤懸絶塞、而黨政軍之力量、尙各有相當之發展、據安西黨務整理委員張聲威所談黨務情形、略謂安西在民國十七八年之黨務、曾由省黨部派人活動、但因時局關係、不久卽行停頓、今國家旣慶統一、　苻亦已歛跡、西北方面、大有承平安謐之氣象、省方對關外黨務、自難再事停頓、遂於本年六月間、由康縣調本人前來整理、業於七月十五日成立整委會、嗣省力又委新任縣長謝壁文、亦兼任黨委、並决議本人擔任常務及組織訓練、謝縣長擔任宣傳、經費原由縣府應徴正雜各欵項下、作正開支、然以應徴各欵早經省方指撥提解凈盡、故成立以來、暫由地方借墊、斯實無可知何之事、蓋此借墊之欵、將來勢必由人民分擔也、安西本爲關外之中心地、兼轄敦玉兩縣之黨務、責任重大、推進不易、卽辦公地點尙借用敎局房屋、目下已徴得男黨員六十餘人、女黨員八九人、而請求入黨者、尙絡繹不絶、茲擬努力宣傳三民主義、使灌輸於民衆腦海、一面並恊助縣府、設立報館、興辦水利、剷除積弊·增設學校、推行新運、講求淸潔、此目前整委會之計劃、亦將來地方設施之方針也、</p>
<p>安西當甘新交通之要　、土地一萬三千二百方里、戶口原爲九百戶、今只存六百餘戶、餘皆逃亡、舊有入口一萬五千人、今當不及此數、地曠人稀、物産豐富、在昔堪稱關外桃源、内地謀生無路者、往往遷移於此、詎近年天災人禍、紛至沓來、農村經濟破産、農民日見逃亡、倘不急圖補救、培養民力、凋敝將不知伊於胡底、茲將農村情形分述於次·</p>
<p>農村災害、一曰風災、安西地近大戈壁、且有一部份已沉没於沙漠中、暴風迅烈、自古已然、每當春季、田苗抽芽之時、輙大風飛揚、沙石蔽天、往往三五日不止、打傷田苗、毁壞花菓、爲害不淺、二曰旱災、農田灌溉、泉水及山水（包括雪水）各居其半、泉水田地、尙無秔旱之虞、山水田地、在雨水通暢之年、山洪暴發、灌溉　　本報特派記者賡雅</p>
<p>尙易、若雨水稀少、渠河涸竭、每致田苗枯槁、赤地千里、自西北大旱以來、安西從未一遇豐年、天災如此、而人禍尤爲劇烈、三曰兵災、民國十八年、變兵吳廷章盤據半年、農民除餉秣雜物予取予求外、匪兵復四出刦掠、凡稍裕之家、必藉搜槍爲名、而行搶掠之實、各村財物、爲之一空、二十二年、馬仲英往返肅州新疆、經此三次、集結大隊、駐紥半年、或三四月不等、卽以最後一次過境動支糧秣各物情形爲例、據縣府調查、安西至哈密　、計程十一點、該軍所需糧秣、純由安西　载、曾動用倉儲糧食四百九十石、民間供支糧料二千餘石、駱駝七百餘隻、牛車五百餘輛、馬三百餘匹、驢六百餘頭、騾二百餘匹、羊八百餘隻、購買各物費用、亦在五千元以上、以一萬五千之人口、供同數軍隊之糧秣、痛苦如何、不難想像、幸今駐軍紀律嚴明、除年支糧秣七百二十石外、餘皆秋毫無犯、然以奄奄待斃之孑遺、欲其休養生息、恢復元氣、殆非易事也、</p>
<p>他處之農民、擁地愈多、愈能坐享大利、安西則適得其反、譬如種地一戶、（爲六十畝）收糧三十餘石、價値三百餘元、而每年田賦官欵、卽達三百餘元、馨其地之所出、供應糧欵、猶虞不給、况種地尙需資本人工、不得不鬻賣牲畜器物以糧欵命、故有「多種多賠本、少種少賠本」之說、因此地價奇跌、上等土地之最高價、每戶只値六十元、（約合一元一畝）其中下等田地、卽倒貼耕牛房屋器俱等、尙無人承種、甚有倒貼少女、或靑年孀婦、（馬仲英任意抓兵拉夫、故關外三縣孀婦甚多、）以與承耕人爲妻之事、田地累人、竟至如此、</p>
<p>安西近年因受甘新交通阻碍、及吳廷章馬仲英騷擾之影響、金融異常枯竭、商業極形凋敝、農村利貸之高、可謂無出其右、其通行借貸之法、略爲兩種、（一）借錢、利率最高者、年利六分、最低者年利四分、（二）支糧、卽在春季借銀一元、至秋收時還麥二斗至二斗五升、若借斗麥、則加還利一倍至倍半之多、此種高貸、雖經縣府取締、其如農民欲繳官欵、迫於需索、卽加重利、猶恐無人借與奈何、</p>
<p>在捐欵繁重之苦况中、農民無法應付、只有逃亡之一途、而已逃者所應負担之欵項、又加之於未逃者之肩上、於是益使未逃農民加速逃亡、如農民逃亡最多之二工、（村名）在民國十六年前、有農民五十戶、去歲尙有十一戶、現在僅賸五戶、此逃亡者之田地、完全荒蕪、其所應負擔之糧欵、一半攤於他村、一半由此五戶負担、計全縣農戶在同治兵燹前、有二千四百餘戶、至民國十年爲九百餘戶、去年尙有七百餘戶、頃據調查、僅餘六百餘戶、且在繼續逃亡中、若不設法補救、恐不數年間、安西將成無民之縣矣、</p>
<p>安西土地、除沙漠不計外、尙有十分之六未經墾種、水草豐美、極宜畜牧、尤其馬鬃山一帶、廣袤數百里、皆爲綠草淵泉、實爲一天然之大牧塲、因之農民副業、卽以畜牧爲主、十六年前、兼事耕牧之農戶、占全農戶總數約十分之七、自遭吳馬變亂之後、馬匹多被强拉、牛羊多被宰殺、以及爲糧欵壓迫而鬻賣牲畜等原因致近年畜牧日瀕於破産、普通耕牧之家、在十年前之畜牧狀况、平均爲馬八匹、牛十五頭、羊八十隻、驢四頭、洎夫十年後之今日、僅餘馬一匹、牛四頭、羊二十隻、驢二頭矣、</p>
<p>安西敎育、全縣二十四村、有初級小學二十七處、每校敎員一人、經費麥子八石、由地方攤派、歸敎局經收、各校學生數、在四十名左右者有四處、二十名左右者亦四處、其餘概在十名左右、總計只五百餘名、約當學齡兒童（二千三百餘名）百分之四、農民之畏入學、如農拉夫、多謂「衣食尙且無着、何暇再令子弟讀書、」若有子弟三四人、僅送學一人、再勸其他入學、則答以「吾家已送一人、何得再行多派、」人民視讀書爲畏途、故敎育不易發展、</p>
<p>綜觀上述各情、安西因受風旱天災之影響、吳馬軍事之騷擾、農村經濟已告破産、乃復以公欵雜捐、層出不窮、農民痛苦、日益加劇、以致整個安西社會、前途日趨没落、苟不迅速設法、積極救濟、其爲邊防隱憂、將不堪設想也、</p>

<p>中國經濟信用合作</p>
<p>社週年紀念特刊</p>
<p>林森題</p>
<h3 id="c2">發刊詞張壽鏞 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中國經濟信用合作社之成立，忽忽一年矣。孔子曰，「期月而已可也，三年有成；釋之者曰，期月謂周一歲之月也：今一歲之月周矣、謂爲已可，則吾豈敢；謂爲有成，則將待之三年乎，卽三年猶未足乎？吾亦未敢預測。</p>
<p>顧就中國經濟而言，三年以前，以視今日何如？更歷三年，又更何如？此吾人所不可不推測者也。壽鏞獨居深念，以生産落後之中國，而益之外來貨物之推銷，農工勞力之墨守成法，爲士爲商者之學術淺薄；相率蹈常襲故，無遠大之眼光，與環境相奮鬥：由今之道，無變今之俗，四海窮困，國亦隨之，此不待著筮者也。</p>
<p>今天下均以此責政府，吾謂政府誠然當負其責，然政府莫不倚賴社會，社會一盤散沙，則政府益將無能爲役；此其責不在上而在下，尤彰彰矣。救之之道，厥維合作。人人有合作之興趣，乃可有合作之事業。合作事業不一，而以經濟合作，爲其根本。由小而大，由一團體而集無量數團體，而後其效乃宏。　　中國經濟信用合作社，一小團體也，何足有裨社會？然由此一團體而提倡至無量數團體，則所謂結成建大厦之水門汀者，吾知其必有合焉。今雖僅及期年，未敢謂爲已可，而俟之三年以至十年，聞風興起，接迹其間，則其有成也，又有賴於邦人君子矣。</p>
<p>本社一年來之概况</p>
<p>丘漢平</p>
<p>本社一年來社務，發展頗速，舉其要者如下：</p>
<p>一，宣傳合作。除出版業務概要，經濟合作，本社一覽等小册外，復有經濟合作週刊，在晨報上附刊，已出至二十三期。經濟合作月刊，出至第四期；改爲社訊，每週一次，又出至第五期。此外開幕及舉行經濟合作運動擴大徴求運動，先後三次，皆在各大報附刊專刊；宣傳力量，更爲廣大。各報之熱心贊助，至堪感謝。</p>
<p>二·徴求社友。去年開幕時，入社社友，僅八五人。七月以後，乃大增加。至上月止，人數共一○二六人。以職業分，店主占二九四人，敎育界占二二零人，最爲多數。惟社會經濟衰落，社友多不能認儲全份，（（全份係到期或身故領回一千元））現在此項收入，每月約二千元。至十月止，共收一萬一千八百餘元。</p>
<p>三·收支情形。本社每月開支，約九百元。房租水電巡捕房捐電話等，約四百餘元。職員近二十人，僅下級職員支領薪水，主要職員，皆願爲合作事業犧牲，僅略支津貼；故每月總計不及四百元。此項開支，除社友儲壽基金項下，抽出十分之一外，皆由基本社員之股金及其利息負擔。將來社友增多，即無須基本社員負担。</p>
<p>四·舉辦事業。今年所辦事業，舉其大者，有招待所，有華海職業中學。招待所供社友寄宿，取費甚低，惜規模太小，現另覓適當地址，大加擴充。華海中學，由張理事長等捐資創設，爲訓練合作人才之所。校舍尙未建築，暫在麥特赫斯脫路。至其他應辦事業，擬逐漸實行。</p>
<p>五·社友利益。本社社友，除普通儲蓄保壽之利益外，尙有其他利益：</p>
<p>甲·有各種貸欵之利益</p>
<p>本社合作貸欵，已辦者有信用貸欵，票據貼現二種，先後貸出欵額一四七二零元。正在舉辦者，有基金證抵借，失業貸欵二種。以社友之儲金，供社友之借貸，儲欵者無異自保基金，借欵者亦無異自付利息也。</p>
<p>乙·有人事指導之利益</p>
<p>本社爲社友服務，已聘請法律顧問十人。醫藥顧問七人，升學指導六人，皆所以備社友不時之諮詢。且不僅備諮詢而已，今年夏且保送社友子弟，免費人華海職業中學肄業。</p>
<p>丙·有消費低廉之利益</p>
<p>商店陳列貨品，眞僞難别，售價不一；日常消費，不一小心，即虚耗金錢。本社爲社友消費節省計，與各公司有特約，社友購買，貨必眞實，價必折扣。已有特約者，計二十九家。書業如中華，世界，工業如家庭工業社，中國化學工業社，藥房如中西藥房，食品如冠生圜，衣服如章華毛織廠，内衣ＡＢＣ，照相館如啟昌，雪懷，大都會。現擬再行接洽，務使各種門類，應有盡有。</p>
<p>本社來年之工作計劃</p>
<p>丘漢平</p>
<p>本社成立之初，即宣告社會，以達到經濟合作爲目的。在過去一年中，我們無日無時不在努力。可惜草創伊始，規模狹小，且入社同Ｉ</p>
<h3 id="c3">合作信託儲金按月存取統計表 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Ｉ</p>
<p>志尙有不明本社性質者。（記得有一位社友到社裏請求借欵，因爲社中欵已貸出，祇能介紹他到别處的地方去，這是本社不得已的苦衷：不料那位社友說了一句很難聽的話，說：「你們不借就不借，何必說没有額數呢」像這位社友根本是以顧客對待店家態度來對本社，這是錯誤的。）不過一種組織要使人明瞭，使人信仰，確是一椿不容易的事。本社在過去一年中，爲求社會人士多多明瞭本社、所以舉行經濟合作運動和擴大徴求運動。我們舉行了這　次運　之後，社會人士稍稍認識本社，給我們工作人員一番鼓舞。</p>
<p>談到來年工作計劃，我們除繼續過去的未了工作外，我們擬定下列幾點：</p>
<p>一·徴求合作同志</p>
<p>甲，小本商人在上海，除了工廠銀行大公司行號之外，可以說百分之八十都是小本商人。這般小本商人對社會的貢獻很大，同時也是受剥削的第二級人，（第一級人是消費者）他們有時需用欵項，簡直摸天無路。我們在過去一千餘名社友中，這類小本商人，已占有百分之二十·足見小本商人是需要加入合作社的。</p>
<p>乙，敎職員　敎職員是社會的導師，他們的責任很重。可是在這經濟破産的中國，敎職員的待遇都很可憐。不但生前生活困難，而且死後還要累人，至於身後子女敎養，更不必說了。像最近逝世的某大學有名敎授，連病時的醫藥費，還要告貸於人，到了死後，專靠朋友來怍拾他的後事。這是多麽可憐的一件事。我們認爲今日中國的敎職員，最需要加入合作社。然而他們都是一盤散沙，同時也没有時間去管理。中國自古至今，寒士都是不務生産的。只有加入合作社，可以得到生活的保障。生前有互助的團體，死後才不愁家室的生活，旣不誤已，又不誤入，這於社會於個人，都是很有益的。不過敎育界人，每每不顧慮到如此之遠，甚至以來日雖有一千元的積蓄，也不見得有濟於事。可是等到他臨難時候，他才覺悟往日之非。</p>
<p>丙，勞工店員因爲中國人多數未受過敎育，智識低落，文字的宣傳效力，對他們簡直等於零。而且在這萬惡的社會裏，要他們積蓄起來，是一伯極困難的事。他們平素所加入的團體，不是　便是會。我們想靠着了解合作的工作人員，向他們　輸合作的智識，同時與廠家合作，促進勞資的共同利益。</p>
<p>至於店員，情形也很可憐。中國舊式商店店員，大都是學徒，每月最多三五塊錢，以之零用，猶感不足，當然談不起積蓄。我們一視同仁，現在想擬定一個方案，使店員亦可享受合作的利益。</p>
<p>二，宣傳合作方面</p>
<p>在過去，我們的宣傳方法，是藉各日報及本社刊物；對於整本小册子，尙未印行。來年對於合作的宣傳，擬側重實行方面。總理以行易知難學說，促成革命，我們也同樣的篤信，祇有實行，才可以完成合作事業。我們擬研究種種實際問題及辦法，比較其得失，出牌單行小册子。對於現有刊物，仍繼續充實，社訊將來改爲較短刊物，仿效美國合作新聞體裁。</p>
<p>三，編輯合作社會計及簿記帳册</p>
<p>欲使中國各合作社整齊劃一，帳册最爲重要。我們擬根據合作社法及各種合作社的性質，編訂帳册，以備各合作社購買。此不但可收整齊劃一之效，且可節省各合作社費用。</p>
<p>四，擴大招待所</p>
<p>本社草創伊始，招待所規模狹小，不敷應用；且附設於社所内，殊感不便。現正設法分開，开求擴充，以應社友之需要。</p>
<p>五，設立辦事處</p>
<p>本社過去一年間，因應各地人土的請求，衔在厦門設辦事處，在荷屬泗水及民禮二埠設代理處。來年擬在南京無錫杭州廣州設辦事處，以謀聯络，而資提倡。</p>
<p>六，徴求基本社員</p>
<p>本社基本社員負加倍責任，初次社金爲五萬元。現擬於來年增加基本社員，希望　到十萬元的數目。</p>
<p>七，召集合作會議</p>
<p>本社鑒於過去合作社之失敗，大多爲缺少聯絡，以致遇事不能互助合作。本社擬於來年召開全作會議，討論實行方案，以期收集思廣益之效。</p>
<p>要之，本社同入，一本過去犧牲精神，共同努力，實行經濟合作互助。希望各界多多給我們指示，處處給我們便利，使合作事業蓬蓬勃勃，共同實現理想的社會。</p>

<p>救災演習總評判</p>
<p>昨經吳市長核定發表</p>
<p>中央社云、本市十一月三日之救災演習、其總評判、昨經吳市長核定發表、茲錄其原文如次、</p>
<p>本市救災演習、業於本月三日夜間舉行、計動員人數約有二萬、經過時間約四小時、在一般公務人貝與民衆團體、素無此種經騐、以及物質缺乏、籌備時間短促、塲合之中、均能於統一指揮之下、精神奮發、熱心從事、實已具備救災上之首要條件、殊堪嘉慰、茲將各評判員、對於各項課目細部動作之意見、分别發表於後、以爲嗣後演習之借鑑焉、</p>
<p>第一課目水災搶險</p>
<p>（地點）南市董家渡永盛碼頭附近、黄浦江邊浦東楊家渡招商棧房高家浜南岸、（部署）董家渡担任部隊公安局之第一部水警之一部、工務局工人之一部、浦東楊家渡担任部隊公安局之一部、保衛團之一部、學生隊之一部、工務局工人之一部、工事規定高一米達、長五十米達厚一米達、（經過時間）十二時三十分開始工作、至四時全部完竣、（評判員）譚文慶·張餘三·張仁春·楊懋榮·魏華·（意見）文總指揮官鴻恩、及張分區指揮官鳴欽編制搶險隊、以工務局工程師及警察民衆學生合組之、頗顯合作以當事變之雛形、浦東中學生隊勇敢活潑、尤爲難能可貴、保衛團雖欠訓練、對於搶險工作尙能努力、其餘動作、稍嫌遲鈍、良以抬土工作、苟非平時練習有素、不易收指臂相助之效、</p>
<p>第二課目救火（地點）閘北靑雲路世界大戲院隔壁、（部署）担任部隊公安局之一部、保安隊之一部、閘北救火會閘北保衛團之一部、童子軍學生隊之一部、華商公共汽車公司汽車三輛、（經過時間）十二時三十分聞報火警、參加入員五分鐘内、即已趕到火塲、兩分鐘内已出水、二十分鐘全部熄滅、（評判昌）李篤初·董致和·（意見）演習時之各項動作、尙屬迅速恊同、惟對於警戒稍欠周密、并有事先事塲準備工作者、似未能適合情况、然救火會童子軍及警察保安隊、均充分表現勇敢敏捷之精神、</p>
<p>第三課目救傷</p>
<p>（地點大統）路新民小學校、（部署）衛生局職員之一部及護車紅十會之救護車、及一部人員、保安隊之一部、公安局警察之一部、閘北保衛團之一部、學生隊童子軍之一部、滬太汽車公司汽車三輛、（經過時間）十二時三十分聞警各軍警及參加團體人員、均於最短時間到達出險地點、施行營救、分别處理二時三十分、已工作完畢、（評判員）李廷安·杜剛·鮑啟通·戴士瑶·（意見）各救護人員動作尙稱努力、救護方法亦頗得宜、惟少認眞及緊張之表現、又於平時行路靠左之習慣、未能養成、似與事變時、動作上有莫大之障碍、而衛生局之救護得宜、新民學生扮演傷者逼眞、尙屬難能可貴　　第四課目修復交通</p>
<p>（地點）徐家匯中山路第一橋、龍華茂公橋至楓林橋一段之軍用電話綫、（部署）工務局職員工人之一部、淞滬警備司令部電話隊之一部、保安隊之一部、公安局警察之一部、保衛團之一部、（經過時間）十二時三十分聞警、開始工作、架設木橋、至四時工作完畢、二時開始架設電話綫、約四千米達之距離、僅需時二十分鐘、已工作完畢、（評判員）劉用臧·陳之毅·吳澤陔·張錦堂·（意見）中山路修橋工作、雖頗迅速、惟運送木料以距離工作塲較遠、不無稍見遲緩、對載重載輛、恐不合使用、架設電話綫、尙與戰時相似、動作活潑迅速、紀律亦好、</p>
<p>第五課目鎭壓暴動</p>
<p>（地點）公安局巡道街文廟兩警察所地段、（部署）防·公安局警察總隊之一部、及巡道街文廟兩警察所警察、攻·學警之一部、（經過時間）十二時半至五時、（評判員）李光曾·郭識吾·李輝匀·梅雪岩·（意見）攻防雙方精神均佳、熱心尤爲難得、惟均有優點及弱點、攻者優點、計劃尙屬周密、欺騙對方手段尙妙、防者優點、部署迅速、報告敏捷、處置得當、攻者弱點膽太大、不合事實、缺少機變動作、防者弱點、檢查欠嚴密、防衛部署、疎密不周、</p>
<p>第六課目緝捕要犯</p>
<p>（地點）公安局西門分局地段、（部署）公安局西門分局警察之一部、公安局偵緝隊之一部、（經過時間）三時至五時、（評判員）湯復天·劉槐·（意見）戒備尙屬嚴密整肅、惟黄家闕路守望警已發現逃犯汽車、復被脫逃一名、汽車復被開走、似與恊同動作、未能迅速分頭注意、</p>
<p>綜合言之</p>
<p>此次演習事屬創舉、成績當然不能十分完滿、雖參加之各單位、均一致努力合作、盡其職責、惜時間倉卒、未能充分宣傳、致仍有多數市民、對於救災意義、缺少相當認識、不無微憾、然分析言之（一）學生隊重子軍服務於各災區、特表演其勇敢敏活之動作、與服務社會之精神、（二）水電公司、電話局、電報局、雖無演習課目、均能澈夜凖備工作、聽候命令、尤合動員原則、（三）紅十字會紅卍字會、事前各編成救護隊、參加演習、不辭勞苦、深得辦理慈善公益要旨、（四）各汽車公司撥出營業汽車、聽候調遣、亦能了解戒嚴時期徴發意義、（五）各區救火會於未指定課目之地段、自行演習緊急出動、凖備救災、亦甚可嘉、（六）市政府·司令部·保安處·憲兵團·保衛團職員、均於是夜或演習搬運重要公文、或演習緊急集合、亦適合情况、（七）軍警崗位巡查之配置、發現疏密不均之缺點、有太多徒耗兵力之處、有太少不嚴密之處、是應顧慮周到、妥爲配備、並於各要點、均須控置預備隊、以備臨時發生之事變、尤應多派巡查隊、梭巡於僻遠之區、以期嚴密、（八）崗警檢查車輛行人時、對於經過車輛行人、均令一一停止受檢、此種方法、殊不適當、且足碍交通、影響秩序、應以銳敏之注意、遇到形跡可疑者、施行檢查、如無可疑之點、照常放行、且險查乎續、亦須力求敏捷、（九）此次演習、因係夜間舉行、故規定種種信號與口令、在能識别信號時、即不須再問口令、而當時軍警、往往已認出其車上之信號、與臂上之臂章、復再詢其燈號口令、致手續太繁、躭誤時間太多、後宜矯正、（十）公安局鎭壓暴動課目、攻防部署尙欠敏活、防者警戒部隊派出太多、應集合控置於相當地點、互爲策應、以免聲東擊西者乘隙而入、攻者應以佯攻手段、引防者兵力集中於一處然後突破其弱點、乘機佔領之、倘分散潛攻、則陷於各個擊破之弊、不免全數受縛矣、所見如此、深望各界同志、對於此次演習、多多指正、俾資改進、是所至感、</p>

<p>錢塘江橋籌備報告</p>
<p>（甲）一建橋計畫</p>
<p>錢塘江横亘浙中、地處衝要、近年東南建設、日異月新、錢路公路之進展愈甚、錢江交通之需要愈切、諸如杭江鐡路之通車、七省公路之修築、及滬杭甬路之急待完成、無一不與錢江有關、倘能横越跨渡、聯貫通車、不僅浙省經濟文化賴以發展、即於全國交通國防亦有莫大關係、前歲曾養甫先生蒞浙、主持建設事業乃創議興建錢江大橋、彌此缺憾、延攬專家、計畫研究、並組織錢塘江橋工委員會、負責進行、對於建橋理由、橋址選擇、橋基地質、錢江水文、連輸需要、綫路聯絡、設計標凖等項詳加研究、並搜羅材料、實地調查、預定工費五百萬元、估計橋梁收入、籌　尙非難事、因擬成　錢塘江建橋計畫書、徴求有關各方之意見、並將設計經過、刊布工程雜誌、茲將計畫書中重要各點略述如次、</p>
<p>（一）建橋理由通過錢江方法不外輪渡、隧道、及橋梁三種、而各有其利弊、一·輪渡丨在水面遼闊之處、本爲最節省之辦法、但錢江水淺、沙灘雙遷無常、引橋工程甚鉅、輪舶所費不資、將來往返通航、更須維持費用、時間尤不經濟、二·隧道　在普通情形之下、需費最昂、錢江細泥極深、水流冲刷甚急、隧道必須深藏、所費甚鉅、且工程進行時間、極無把握、將來遇有損壞、修理亦屬不易、三·橋梁　爲一勞永逸之方法、錢江行旅極繁、而水上不通巨舶、最合建造橋梁之條件、</p>
<p>（二）橋址選擇就杭州地形而論、南星橋距城市最近、且爲渡江碼頭、若可建橋、自屬便利、無如兩岸相距甚遠、江流無定、潮水影響亦較大、建築經費恐嫌過鉅、其他各處、經多次勘騐、似以閘口之滬杭甬鐡路終點爲最宜、其地江面較狹、河身穩定、北岸沙灘亦少且正對虎跑山谷、於聯絡各項路綫、比較便利、從經濟上觀察、實非他處可及、</p>
<p>（三）橋基地質錢塘江底泥沙極厚、往年屢有造橋提議、皆以基礎困難、引爲顧慮、民國二十一年、浙省建設廳動議建橋、乃先從事鑽探工作、以爲設計之根據、於選定橋址鑽探五口、計河身三口、兩岸各一、最深之口、達江底下四八公尺、最淺之口、亦至二七公尺、其土質分配情形、最下石層、自北至南、傾斜甚驟、其上土質均係軟泥細沙、揉和摻雜、間遇粗沙卵石、亦復無幾、故基礎深度、必須儘量加足、利用四周泥沙之阻力、以减少底層之載重、去歲去處成立之後、復於橋墩　所在、各鑽一口、以資比較、計已探十四口、共結果與前相似、</p>
<p>（四）錢江水文錢江自浙省西南奔赴東北入海、流經杭市、漸入海　、故兩岸遼闊、江潮洶湧、據閘口站水文記載、自民四以來、最高水位、達黄浦零點上九·四五公尺、最低水位三·七九公尺、通常在五公公对七公尺之間、　每年六七月間水位較高外、終年無鉅大變化、惟有應顧慮者、厥爲水流冲刷問題、其最甚之處、在五個月内、可刷深五·五公尺、足徴泥沙淤厚斷面時有變遷、於橋基設計影響殊鉅也、</p>
<p>（五）運輸需要杭州錢江義渡、统計每日渡江人數、最少一萬一千餘人多至一萬七千餘人、其中浙贛鐡路乘客約一千三百六十人、公路乘客約一千一百六十人、至於渡江貨物約略預計每年當在四十萬噸以上、故通過橋梁之運輸計有火車、汽車、及行人三種、而每種皆甚繁密、本計畫内特備鐡路、公路、及行人道、三種、路面各不相犯、一切車輛行人均可同時通過、無須號誌控制、以期便利、而保安全、</p>
<p>（六）綫路聯絡本橋目的、爲一·使浙贛鐡路直達杭州、以便接通京滬、二·使滬杭甬路自杭州展至百官、完成綫路、三·使浙東浙西各公路路綫連接貫通、本橋在閘口方面、擬定鐡路路綫、經虎跑山谷穿烏芝嶺繞回江干、在閘口南星橋兩站之間、與滬杭路接軌、對岸經靜江站達蕭山、（七）設計標凖一·橋長丨江面正橋在錢江控制綫之間、計長一公里、北岸引橋、計長二二○公尺、南岸沙灘引橋及墊土計長五○○公尺、二·橋　丨橋面應供鐡道公路及行人之用、計單綫鐡道凈寛四·八八公尺、公路淨寛六公尺、人行道凈寛三公尺、三·橋高丨北岸附近江流中泓之處、橋身距平時水面凈空九公尺、四·　距丨橋　距離在江流深水處最少五十公尺、以便行船之用、五·載重丨橋梁載重計鐡道須按照鐡道部標準相當於古柏氏五十級、公路須能行駛十五噸之汽車、人行道須顧及人羣排擠之重、六·坡度丨橋面坡度鐡道最大千分之六、公路最大百分之四、七·橋式丨應取简單式樣活橋固不必需、所有連　橋翅臂橋·懸橋·拱橋·及其他長徑間之複雜形式、均當避免、</p>
<p>（乙）部省合辦</p>
<p>此次興建錢江大橋、雖係由浙省動議、而鐡道部因完成滬杭甬路關係、自始即表示贊同、往返洽商、甚爲圓滿、在浙省自魯主席以次各省委均極熱心、建設廳曾　甫廳長及財政　周枕琴前廳長職責所在尤爲盡力、在鐡部　自顧部長錢曾次長、以及各司長、均提倡甚力、陳耀祖司長、及滬杭甬路黄伯樵、吳紹曾兩局長、輔贊尤勤、本橋昔爲幻想、今得開始興工者、胥賴數先生之力、不得不引爲感幸者、至於部省合作辦法經兩方商訂大綱、各負一半責任、茲擇錄如次、</p>
<p>（一）建築橋梁經费、及橋梁維持费、由雙方平均負担、其收入亦平均分配之、</p>
<p>（二）建築計劃、由雙方會商恊定執行、建築計劃、由雙方公委一工程處辦理之、並在工程時期、由雙方各派代表一人、負監工之責、</p>
<p>（三）橋梁完工後、由雙方合組委員會管理之、雙方收入、各按照借欵條件專欵存儲、維持工程、由委員會委托一方之鐡路局担任之、以專職責、</p>
<p>（四）雙方之借欵抵押、須不衝突、即各以該橋産權及餘利之半爲限、現鐡道部、派夏光宇參事、爲督工代表、浙省府派曾養甫廳長爲督工代表、均已分别視事、</p>
<p>（丙）組織經過</p>
<p>去歲七月間、浙省建設廳、組織錢塘江橋工委員會、擬具建橋計畫書、並進行籌欵、是爲組織初步、本年四月、因辦理招標、及橋址之測量鑽探等因、將委員會改組、正式成立錢塘江橋工程處、以工學博士茅以昇爲處長、前北寗鐡路技術室主任工程師羅英、爲總工程師、現以部省合作、復將該處改爲直隸部省機關、辦理本橋之一切工程事宜、至橋工完竣時撤銷、本處組織有一特異之點、即於規程中訂明得招收大學畢業生實地練習、俾養成橋梁專門人才爲異日工程之助、（未完）</p>

<p>硬地網球男子單打錦標决賽</p>
<p>王文正五盤勝卡爾生</p>
<p>王兩角對抽十拿九穩其妙無匹</p>
<p>惜乎發球與壓殺欠佳美中不足</p>
<p>今日下午二時男雙打决賽</p>
<p>法商總會主辦之第二十二屆硬地網球錦標賽、昨日男子單打决賽之結果、王文正突於出人意料之外、以五盤擊敗上海草地網球單打冠軍卡爾生、成績六比零、四比六、五比七、六比三、九比七、王文正昨日表演、確已竭盡其能、小心應戰、絲毫不苟、故能有此意外之故績也、明日下午男子雙打决賽、卡爾生德孕對邱飛海朋納費區、昨日單打情形如下、</p>
<p>王文正丨（六比○四比六五比七六比三九比七）丨卡爾生</p>
<p>得失大勢</p>
<p>王文正本年度、一勝林寳華、再勝邱飛海、昨又勝卡爾生、當謂後生可畏、希望無窮、但在技術上尙須努力求進、其正乎左右兩角之對抽、十拿九穩、已臻爐火純靑之境、但其發球、實嫌太弱、昨日不過網與出界者甚多、壓殺之技、尤須從速訓練、昨日王在極度優勢下、以缺乏此二項技術、致造成此苦戰之局面、否則當以直落三得勝、在卡爾生因不能發揮其壓殺及攔網之特長、發球亦不能置王於死地、爲慘敗之原因、王出球甚低、常恰　過網、亦爲其得勝之原因、　　苦戰情形</p>
<p>王文正開球、以極準確有力之兩角對抽、向卡爾生進攻、卡亦以對抽還擊、遂一局復一局、爲王所得、卡見大勢已去亦任其所之、結果六對零、第二盤卡開始上網、但發球者皆得勝、各二各三、王失落第七局之發球、卡爾生乃以六比四、奞回第二盤、第三盤王以四比二佔先、惜爲卡追成四比四、王救回第九局、卒爲卡連勝二局、七比五卡爾生又勝第三盤、比盤之中、王發見三次極佳之殺球機會、但皆送入網中、全塲惋嘆、從此王不敢輕易殺球、第四盤王復猛烈之正手抽進攻、再以六比三得勝、最後决賽一盤、卡先發球、發球者復各得勝、直至四比四、從此則又見奇狀、發球者又失敗、成六比六之數、七比七後、王連勝二局得錦標、王在此盤中、有兩次觸帶之球、但皆過網、或亦運到耳、混合雙打决賽結果如下、</p>

<h3 id="c14">童子軍的精神 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！你知道童子軍的精神是怎樣的？他們的精神是非常偉大，那末，究竟有什麽偉大呢？現在我約略地講一段給你們聽聽。</p>
<p>他們是有組織的小軍隊，生活是非常簡單，隨地可以生活，並且個個都有自治的精神，不讑論遇到一件極難的事情，總是抱着不屈不撓的精神，要做到成功才罷！他們又有愛護的精神，若路上遇到小孩跌在地上哭的時候，立刻把他挽起或送他到家裏，若有人問路，就很誠懇地指導他或領導他到目的地，更有犧牲的精神，無論遇到一件極危險的事情，或在一髮千鈞的時候，就奮不顧身，把生命置之度外，非要救他出險不可。服務的精神，也是常見的，我們在運動會或其他的集會的時候，他們都認眞地維持會塲的秩序，很盡他們應盡的責任。你想：童子軍的精神！是何等偉大呢！</p>
<p>小朋友！你們年紀雖小，志氣却非常的高，趕快培養童子軍應有的偉大精神，更希望你們個個加入童子軍，大家來發揚童子軍的精神，打破全世界的紀錄，那末，你們一定可以救我們危亡的中國哩！</p>
<h3 id="c15">少年鼓手 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 沈承昭</p>
<p>當英法交戰的時候，英軍隊中有一個鼓手，年齡在十五六歲左右。一天他偶然到外面來散步，忽然被法兵所俘，一直解到司令官面前，司令官對他說：</p>
<p>「喂，年輕的朋友，你當什麽的啦？」</p>
<p>「長官，我當一名鼓手。」他很鎭靜地回答。</p>
<p>那個司令官於是命人取了一個鼓，吩咐他擊一下。這年輕的少年，把鼓放妥了，拿起一對槌子，開始擊奏了一支慷慨激昂的進行曲，那麽雄壯激烈的聲調聽了都會感動的。</p>
<p>當他奏完了進行曲，那司令官又呌他擊一支退軍曲。他立刻毫不思索地抛棄了槌子，怒冲冲地向司令官說：</p>
<p>「長官，我不懂這個，我英人從不曾愛過臨陣脫逃的敎育呵！」</p>
<p>那司令官便馬上走過來和他携手，接着命令他的衛隊長送他回去。並且親自寫了一封信給他的司令官，稱讚他的勇敢哩。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們瞧這個少年鼓手是多麽鎭靜，多麽勇敢呵！</p>
<h3 id="c16">可敬哉日本人！ <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 祖蔭</p>
<p>小朋友：當你們瞧了這個標題時，一定有些不滿意；以爲日本人那樣的横蠻，陰狠·狡詐…恨之不暇，有什麽可敬？但是，且慢，請瞧下文。</p>
<p>前天申報上記載着電通社這樣一段新聞：</p>
<p>「神奈川縣厚木轲飛機塲之落成禮，與少年義勇號飛機之始飛典禮，今日上午十時舉行，儀式隆重，該機塲與該飛機之基金，係日本義勇會命全國小學兒童積集捲烟之錫紙作基金，意在養成少年航空家及普及民間之飛行思想…」</p>
<p>日本人的民族性，是素富於苦幹硬幹實幹的眞精神。當日俄戰爭時，捐集全國小學生節省下來買糖果吃的錢，造一軍艦，用以鼓勵前方士氣。後來，果收最後的勝利。現在又利用這區區捲烟包裏的一張錫紙，作普遍的宣傳，喚起民衆，以預備應付這（不久之將來）的世界大戰。他們的用心之深。設想之奇，愛國之何等迫切，從這幾點上，那麽，不獨是可敬，而且是最足爲吾們所取法哩</p>
<p>小朋友：你們以爲怎樣？</p>

<p>這個樹名很特别，因爲它生長起來很慢，這就是說公公（卽祖父）手粤栽的的，要到孫子時候纔吃到它的果子，古語說：「十年樹木」，可是公孫樹是在例外了，大凡動植物生長得慢，壽命也就很長，公孫樹旣然生長得這樣慢，所以幾百年的老公孫樹，還是靑枝綠葉，不會枯朽的，這樹高的達十丈，係落葉喬木，葉很像扇子，有缺刻，春天開小花，花白帶淡綠，秋天結實很多，果肉是不能吃的，霜後肉爛，取核爲果，外面有殼，白色，所以呌白果，白果一名銀杏，七八月上市，小賣販把那炒熟的白果放在布袋裏，手拿着鍋鏟在鍋裏翻拌碎磁片，丁東丁東的響，口裏狂喊着詩調也似的高聲，大街小巷，到處呌賣，在十二歲以内的小朋友，如買着多吃了些，就往往會中白果毒，發起病來，是很厲害的，這病狀口吐白沫，筋脈攣動，好似驚風一般，爸爸和媽媽，倘若不知道是中了白果毒，請醫生當驚風治，藥不對症，致傷生的，所以小朋友要注意戒少食，在吃的時候，把當中的心剥開去掉爲是，又凡中白果毒用鹹鮝魚頭骨煎湯飲，毒卽吐出。</p>

<p>— 杜鵑</p>
<p>往往有許多小朋友們，功課完畢之後，便把課本一丢，忙着幹無意識的玩意兒去了。於是臨考考不出，對功課時時發生厭惡的印象；以致學校裏旣不得過去，將來對社會也無貢獻，而欲這樣糢糢糊糊地産生人才，眞是談何容易！</p>
<p>要補救這劣點，惟有「自修一一個辦法。每個小朋友在上課時固然要靜心聽講，回家後應靜心自修。譬如我每天有四時或五時的自修時間，那末應當把上課時先生所講的課程複習一下。功課做和好了便感得興趣；愈感到有興趣越要做功課，於是你便可選揀你最性近的學問努力攻讀。每天規定幾小時自修，只準增多，不準减少；如果没有多大的暇時，每天自修一小時或兩小時也是好的，只要能專心一致，年深月久，末有不成功的；不過最緊要的一句話，自修要有「恒心」。</p>
<p>小朋友們大概都知道愛迪生是一個自低成功的科學家。我們便可確定任何學問都能自修，而且都能自修成功。如果小朋友們能在學問上自修，作研究式的探討，中國也未嘗没有愛迪生這般人哩！</p>

<p>— 孔皆</p>
<p>水，普通說是種流質。但，在各種不同的情境下它會變成各種形態。像是我們在故事裏看到的會變的妖怪丨般。</p>
<p>我們知道沸騰的水會變成氣。但，我們平日所看見的從沸水裏放出的氣，並不是眞正的氣，那只是顆顆微小的水滴，因爲水蒸氣遇到冷的空氣便凝結起來，天上的雲，正似我們看見的從沸水裏放出的氣，遇冷而結成的大塊的小水滴，雲是由於地上的水蒸發變氣，一遇冷空氣，便凝結成許多小水滴，近地面的是霧，高些的便是雲。雲浮在天空，遇到更冷的空氣，便結成更大的水點，這種水點較重於空氣，於是落下來，這便是雨。雨的落下來原是一點一點的，但因這是連續的動作，所以映到我們眼裏來時，雨似乎是長條地落向地面，這理由正和活動影片相同。水蒸氣在地面遇到冷東西便成霜，若在空中遇到極冷的空氣，便結成片片美麗的雪花，飄降下來。但在攝氏表零度以下時，水會結成堅固的哽的冰。</p>
<p>水真是善於變形的東西。</p>

<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>天氣漸漸冷了，小朋友們都曉得身上冷，應該加穿些衣服。天冷的時候，普通穿的是棉衣。但是，棉衣是怎樣做成的呢？小朋友們知道嗎？棉衣有很多種類，大部份人穿的，總是夾衣裏面翻進棉花去，做夾衣面子和夾裏的有的用綢緞，有的用呢絨，也有的用棉布。</p>
<p>棉布是用棉花織成的，棉花是一種草本植物，在八九月間，就結果實，果實成熟，皮就裂開，這裏面的色的纖維，就是織棉布，翻棉花的原料。（圖一）</p>
<p>做衣服原料的還有一種絲，是從蠶（圖二）吐出來的，鄕下地方的農家，養蠶就是他們的副業。蠶像靑蟲一樣的軟體體爬蟲，顔色灰白，喜吃桑葉，經過四眠以後，就上簇吐絲，自缚成繭。當他成繭的時候，就用沸水，或火焙，使裏面的蛹死亡，把繭繅成絲條，便是織綢緞的原料了。絲的價錢貴，所以織成的綢緞也就貴了，因此，不是一般人所常常服用的。</p>
<p>至於織呢絨的原料，却是用羊毛（圖三）的。普通做綿衣裏子的駱駝絨，是用駱駝（圖四）的毛織成的。這些都是能禦寒，而且穿在身上柔軟舒適，能夠抵禦外面冷空氣的侵入，保持身上原有的温熱，是冬天衣服的上等原料，可惜價錢很貴，不是中下等人所能製備的。</p>
<p>冬天禦寒的衣料中還有一種獸皮，獸皮中最温熱的是狐皮。（圖五）其他還有狼皮，豹皮，羊皮，貓皮，鼠皮，許多種類，但總不及狐皮那樣暖熱，可是價格比呢絨還昂貴，更不是一般人的經濟力量所能購置的。</p>
<p>夏天衣服的原料，最普通的是夏布，他是麻（圖六）織成的。質鬆，而薄，做成衣服穿在身上就很凉快。</p>
<h3 id="c23">水底潛望鏡 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— （公望）</p>
<p>深水的地方，往往都是暗淡的，所以要去觀察水底的東西，常常會遇到阻礙，難得達到目的。現在我有一個　便的方法：</p>
<p>這個小玩意，定名水底潛望鏡：先用通常的一個玻璃瓶，把日常所用的電筒放在瓶裏，（放進去的時候，燈頭須向上，把電光撳亮。），然後蓋上瓶蓋，在瓶口須塗上一層蠟漆，使水不易浸入。塗好以後，等他慢慢乾了，用一條繩子纏在頸瓶上。玩的時候，把瓶漸漸垂入水中，於是水中的一切東西，便可一目瞭然了。</p>
<h3 id="c24">怎樣做紀念週 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>

<p>小朋友門：</p>
<p>明天又是紀念週了，像車輪似地旋轉，一週一週的就把這時光趕走了，可是它跑得這樣快，我們却要拚命去追趕它，抓住它！</p>
<p>抓住它的方法：惟有從有「計劃」「做起」：計劃：是生活的進程，過有計劃的生活，才算是進步的敎育，受過「生活敎育」洗禮小朋友們：他是一天有一天的計劃，一月有一月的計劃，一年有一年的計剿，尤其做紀念週，是一週計劃臨頭的一天，古語：「一日之計在於晨」要知「一週之計在於紀念週，紀念週：是多麽嚴重的一天呢？要努力把一週計劃訂好，不容有一點馬虎，等到你們開生活週會的時候，嚴厲地考核一下，工作是否完畢？成績是否盡美？這樣才算不孤負做紀念週！</p>
<p>小朋友們：最信仰偉大人物，不是孫中山先生嗎？他的革命事業，也是從「有計劃」「有恒心」「努力做」，幹出來的，你們旣景仰他的爲人，更要去仿效他，这才是眞正紀念他啊！</p>

<p>小朋友！我們知道玻璃的主要成分是：矽酸，石灰及鹼素，普通砂内含有砂酸和石灰。而木灰是鹼性物質，所以他們的化合物便變成了現在透明的玻璃了</p>
<p>小朋友！砂粒和木灰等都是極難看而無用的東西，經過人工把他們化合後，會變成那樣美麗潔純的物體的，小朋友們！這不是很奇怪嗎？</p>

<p>觀高空氣籠罩紗市</p>
<p>紗市趨漲、形勢又見緊俏、因客帮現紗需要接踵而來、同時美棉又回漲、致買方意態愈强、且有一部份投機者在市搜羅現紗甚功、探其原因、謂預料蜀帮有發動採辦之舉、因此觀高心思、達於極點矣、</p>
<p>金雞高漲一元二</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉回漲、上日現紗銷路良好、致賣戶缺乏、市情頗緊、各月均漲八角至一元二·四·五角、午後開盤市况仍挺聞現紗交易有二千包、但拍至收盤因有多頭了結、各月跌一·二·三角、余日成交統計二萬九千三百包、查賣出恒大四百包吉豐七百五十包、穗隆六百包、泰興四百包賡豐一千八百五十包、瑞大五百包、愼記一千一百五十包、恒德四百包、仁豐七百五十包、義成八百包、大昶六百包、永昌四百五十包達記四百包明德四百五十包、同和七百包、買進大孚五百五十包、運記六百包、大豐一千六百包、明德七百五十包、振大四百五十包元一千七百包、長豐一千九百包、潤康三千○五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市堅硬、因美棉轉漲、而紗市回高、致人心尤挺、且甬帮講進抵補、但金市趨跌、匯兌放長、所以大戶之空額仍不動、惟現棉因到貨未旺較堅、不過標花成交甚少云、</p>

<p>丨英廠注意購用美棉丨</p>
<p>紐約九日棉市、開盤價格、較昨日低二磅音、一般正在等候政府發表明年耕種面積、但不久因利物浦電訊良佳、以他國棉花之可用者逐漸减少、對美棉漸起注意、加以美國國内同業方面需要宏大、且無抛賣壓力、故趨勢向上、現行家收買十二月份、股市之抛秀、亦有相當助力、於是市價挺進、若干方面聲稱、新國會極端反對增加耕種面積、參議員彭克海氏亦謂是項計劃、足使市價低落、故與政府之意旨相反、紗布市况較前靈活、價格亦頗穩定、上週紗廠進貨共二十四萬七千包、英棉期貨漲一點、印棉初因塲中操業者買進而昂、後因歐洲出口商賣出而回、計平果爾漲二角半、奥姆辣　半羅比、白羅溪漲七角半、原電錄左、（九日電）</p>

<p>糧食金帮購進遠月粉</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈逐步回穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲二角左右、坎拿大漲八分至一角不等、當開價時、以洋麥之轉穩、各廠抛胃、一致停寂、是以開價雖見平定、惟至二盤以後、因近期廠方略有抵補、遠期則業外微有吸收、故開價遂見良好、迨至下午開盤、本月份趨勢、尙見平定、遠期則因金子帮又有活動、三四月份聞開盤進二三萬包、致市氣爲之激動、較上午即好二分零、至二盤因投機停乎、略呈定勢、結果本月份回漲二分二厘半、十二月份漲二分、一二月份漲三分半、三月份漲三分七厘半、四月份漲三分</p>
<p>期麥後市多頭活動</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平靜之象、以洋麥報價、雖較前日回好八分至一二角左右、惟市場方面、冷寂異常、故開價後、人心平平、出入兩寂、較之前日、上落甚少、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、又由停寂而良好、以粉市轉昂、漲勢頗健、致市塲之臨時多頭、亦大活動、開價亦步步上漲、此種情形、完全受粉市所激動也、结果本月份較漲七分、十二月份漲七分、一月份漲六分、二月份漲五分、三月份漲六分、現麥市面、依然穩固、開山東徐州蚌埠宿州麥三元九角、瑶灣麥三元九角、次八角八分、大橋麥三元八角半、計五千包、</p>

<p>九日芝加哥市内一般人士、近來對於各地氣候、異常注意、聞美國西南區天氣乾旱、農民渴望雲雨、阿根廷小麥區　雨連綿、田禾有腐敗之虞、澳洲則有黄蟲爲患、此外更無其他消息足助市價上升、交易情形恍惚不定、現貨仍堅强、各方進胃亦佳、惟高價時頗有多頭了结、玉米好起約一分、由於牲畜飼料情形緊張、及現貨高額擴大所致、政府之小麥估計、共十三萬七千一百萬英斛係利多頭、加拿大政府報告春麥之生産計二萬七千五百二十五萬二千英斛、按去年則爲二萬六千九百七十二萬九千英斛、</p>

<p>河米滯銷轉軟</p>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源二十來號、（貨共三千餘石）本街作客蒞市者不多、而隔昨兜胃亦復有限、形勢　憊、所幸客帮包胃、靑島烟台等帮、續能採取六七百包、因之市態尙呈平定、後市趨勢、降多升少、各帮晚稻及野稻白稻等厚新粳價悉無上落、而杜洋尖與陰元等各花色行情、亦屬相仿、變元則以缺貨無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各地鎭城到船二十四五號、河存一百十餘艘、市上各貨銷路、新粳陳白元新埠杜客尖薄稻零胃早市略有交易、後市淸淡、破粳新羊尖稍化、全市銷貨不滿二三千石、做開寥寥、市形新粳高貨平瘦、中次修一二角、早稻新羊杜尖陳白尖亦小角外、破粳平定、薄稻新陳埠客尖價疲數分、</p>
<p>洋米抛出仍不少</p>
<p>丨客币内地去路不弱丨</p>
<p>昨日内地帮繼續暢辦客秈、惟邇日客秈到頭係屬奇零小數、久無整票到埠、且中次居多、而市上存底亦枯、故中次各擋均被帶好一角左右、全日開出湘米二千六百六十四包、漢口河市一各四百廿九包、江北機米二百包、多數爲内地辦去、本街祗四五百包而已、現洋米被河下米平落影响、市已帶平、期洋米洋行續有抛出、昨元利捷成等先後售出西貢三月份三千噸、暹邏三月份二千五百噸、現米亦開出西貢米暹邏米元米碎米等二千包、回籠期貨四百五十噸、亦多數由内地辦去、惟期米因洋行一再售出市價乃見步下云、</p>
<p>黄豆價高銷路减縮</p>
<p>黄豆市况、自一度高漲後、來源略衆、去路則價高减縮、行情比較前市跌角　、成交歸　豆三千四五百包、價自三元零六分至三元、穎州豆一車、價爲二元八角半、大連豆二車、價三元六角三、穎州陳豆五車、價扯三元一角、漢口新乍豆二百零五包、價二元八角、各豆去路、爲内地本街油廠云、</p>
<p>油市新貨到後之白桐油</p>
<p>白桐油各産地見新後、人心望廉甚殷、市面難免疲化、豈知漢口洋莊時有採辦、乃能合洋銷之油、貨色不多、致反見缺俏狀態、上月下旬曾漲至三十元零四角、迨本月初因洋銷懈怠、即跌二十九元六角、照内銷如此淸淡、當此新油將旺之際、自然有大跌希望、惟洋行箱貨毫無捉摸、自不能以内銷而料未來之市面也、近日漢函所詳、謂新貨未有湧到、洋行辦雖少數、然尙繼續不絶、期貨十二月份及一月份均有做過、價格僅二十五元光景、則後市當可想見矣浙江桐油新貨已絡繹有到、但因初見報新市面未易跌足、故杭州行家在申售貨、現油須每砠二十六元送申、而遲解期貨當可特别廉價、聞陰曆年内解齊、祇二十四元左右、可見新貨愈遲愈廉也、據今庚桐子年令尙好、而好價亦不大、大概産地榨坊尙能獲利、將來必有湧到無疑、</p>
<p>南北貨什路圓開出二千餘箱</p>
<p>什路桂圓、昨日已有一部份開出、約　千餘箱、頂上莊爲三十二元左右、其次照减、下檔爲十五元許至十一元左右、尙有上中普通貨、因爲時已晚、不及再開、須俟今日續開、市價比前盤上檔無甚升降、下檔則好起五六角至七八角不等、尙有一部份恐價不和難開、</p>

<p>— 兹九</p>
<p>法律，原是保護人的，也是人們自己創造的，但現在各國的法律，常是支配者用以範鑄被支配者的。它是一種支配者「有利的組織」的表現，所以要知道某國的階級或兩性間之屬從關係如何？常可在該國的法律上看出來。在中國過去的民法草案上，曾有「達於成年，兼有識别力者，始有行爲能力，但妻子不在此例」之規定。按民法上行爲能力受限制的，尙有「未成年人」和「精神病人」等，好好的人丨丨女子，硬把她和精神病人一樣看待，多氣人？但這，正可說明中國過去的法律，是怎樣地規定了女子的地位。現在中國的法律，在名義上雖較過去進步多了，但在整個的中國婦女，尙没有得到眞正平等的現社會下，這法律，當然不會澈底公平的。最近所修正的刑法，確有些進步，但「墮胎罪」「妨害風人经罪」「妨害婚烟及家庭罪」各章，仍然儘有不爲婦女大衆着想的條例。</p>
<p>最近南京諸婦女團體。認爲立法院所通過的現行刑律二三九條丨丨有夫之婦與人通姦者，處一年以下有期徒刑，其相姦者亦同丨丨只科女子以刑罰，而有妻之夫，與人通姦者，却不受法律的制裁，仍脫不了陳腐的片面貞操觀念，有違黨國標榜男女平權之原則，表示反對，宣傳請願，同時並行，各地婦女團體也在紛紛響應。這很可表示目前中國的婦女，已不是過去的中國婦女了。被壓者已漸在抬頭了！雖然僅求空洞的法律上的平等，不是婦女解放的眞正目的。但至少這樣起來反抗，比默認强得多。這種精神，値得提倡的；這種毅力，値得取法的，應該大家起來參加這運動！</p>
<p>不過這次的運動，即使能如願地修改爲：「有配偶與人通姦者，處徒刑幾年……」，甚至將修正刑法二三九條完成删去，它的結果，亦不過得到法律上的所謂對等貞操，或部分人的性生活的自由而已。這還不是目前婦女解放的眞正目的。</p>
<p>雙重壓迫下的中國巡女！在這帝國主義與封建勢力的重壓下，在這男性中心現社會的困迫下，將怎樣繼續這次爭法運動」的精神，擴大組織，對上述的重壓，加以反抗，而爭到最後的目的丨丨經濟機構上，男女一律平衡行目的！</p>
<h3 id="c32">攻打事實 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 碧遥</p>
<p>這回立法院恢復「有夫之婦與人通姦，處一年以下有期徒刑」，而删去草案中有婦之夫與人通姦的刑法，頗引起了微凉的漣漪。首都婦女各界，組織了力爭法律平等同盟會，通電各地要求聲援；算近年止水似的巡女運動，平添了幾片落葉。</p>
<p>立法委員諸公，對此條欵心乎不曾婦虎，曾經熱烈地熱烈地辯論。終以在我們中華，男子背離家庭，背離操守，和别的女人發生一點通姦，眞是眉毛尖的小事！這而給他處罰，法律將給人笑話，故而删去了，而且目前大多數的婦女，依賴「所天」爲生；就不删去，也自奈何她的「所天」不得。事實在前，委員諸公不過循行而已對於這回新刑法的感想，最主要的卻不在男女處罰的未能平衡，而在於夫婦關係的借法律以爲維持。這種家庭的安全，充其量也不過等於藥石的維持生命。一般人大可任其驅馳歌跳於自然廣塲，以增加他的健　；若必通盤塞入密室之中，縱可免傷風咳嗽，豈竟可無病苦之虞？夫婦關係而不以愛情爲歸，將見新文化運動以前的「舊生活」，重演於今日了。</p>
<p>其次則是法律的對於事實的遷就，這一點很可惕心。處罰有婦之夫與人通姦案的不能成立，和强姦罪中女子的年齡由十六歲减爲十四歲、都是囿於現成的事實。實則天地間事實可以錯到萬分，而正義不可歪曲一分。法律果眞維護正義，對於不平的醜惡的事實，當然祇有脚踢開。然而這層是不可期待於今日。不獨中華，帝國主義者組成的國聯，一切也都以旣成事實爲公斷；更北淪亡而後，我們的向牠啼哭，情知是白做了的。</p>
<p>空文不如實際。照自前婦女經濟不能獨立的狀况，男女平等的法律，不會有的；就有也將是等於具文。唯有握住了經濟的實權，才是我們的武器，才能搗毁這些不平的事實，才能實現我們平等的法律。</p>
<p>最可怕的是屈服於旣成事實的奴根性，在社會有很深的根苗；婦女界因爲見了男尊女卑女人到處碰壁的事實，所以雖然新思潮已輸來了十餘年，而一理喊一聲賢妻良母主義，便都願脫離爭受經濟權的社會而回到家庭去！</p>
<p>其實事實算得甚麽？事實不是鐡鑄的；祇要工夫到，是鐡鑄的便攻打不破碼？</p>
<h3 id="c33">我們爲什麽要反對刑法修正案二三九條 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 綠子</p>
<p>刑法修正案第二三九條，卽「有夫之婦與人通姦者，處一年以下有期徒刑，其相姦者亦同」一條通過後，京中婦女界認此爲侮辱婦女人格，違反男女平等的大原則，提出反對，請求修改。</p>
<p>有人謂法律上得到平等，男女也未能眞正平等。不錯，在封建思想未打破，舊禮敎勢力未消滅，經濟權仍操諸男子手中的現中中國社會下，就使法律上規定了男女平等，女子事實上還是不能與男子享受同等的權利的。譬如關於與人通姦這件事情，卽使法律上規定了不論男女，凡有配偶而與人通姦者，卽處以相當刑罰，多數的女子，因爲經濟方面得倚賴男子的緣故，因爲受相傳幾千年的「女子從一以終」的思想所縛束的緣故，就是她的丈夫與人通姦了，她亦何常能如男子一樣的利用這條結果會得罪對方或致離異的法律？</p>
<p>不過，卽使二三九條的條文本身對目前中國的婦女無重大的影響，但由這條修正案所表現出來的思想，是我們不能不反對的。</p>
<p>凡稍留心研究世界的趨勢，社會文明的演進的人，誰都承認女子和男子對于社會的貢獻是一樣有價値。誰都承認男女平等合作是促進社會，使臻于完善之道。只有承認男女平等的理論和事實，國家社會才會有進展。我國如甘爲文化落後之國家則巳，否則，這種反乎世界趨勢，阻碍國家社會進化的思相，是不容存在的。</p>
<p>爲了保持婦女的人格，爲了擁護天經地義的男女平等的眞理，爲了謀社會的進步，人類的幸福，我們誓死反對這種不平等的修正案。十一月八日于南京</p>

<h3 id="c35">經濟獨立是性的先决條件（續） <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— 洪華</p>
<p>十八世紀英國産業革命的結果，上午上萬的貧苦而受男子虐待的婦女，决了堤口般的如洪濤之洶湧，她們從禁錮的狹小的家庭裏流出來，獻身於人類幸福的生産事業了。消耗牛馬以上的勞力，得僅够活命的工資，雖是她們更增進了一種與無産者同一忍受剥削的命運，在經濟上，這一部份婦女是取得了相當獨立的機會；不能不是婦女本身接近「自由路徑」的事吧。</p>
<p>自然，這狀况，對婦女仍是可悲的，極度忍受來換取生活的結論，在資本主義本質上說，除却促進一切被壓迫者的對自身生存不滿的團結外，這一部分婦女，和家庭奴隸婦女一樣的，不曾受到資本主義社會任何賜與的幸福。</p>
<p>社會的權力者，是以男子爲中心呵！！這就是說明，一切有利於男子的條件，像並不曾受過風雨剥蝕的鐡柱似的，仍安然的樹立在權力者！男子的周圍。</p>
<p>更重要的，習慣的成見，因襲的道德，如同生　根似的深種在人類的心底，而成爲婦女解放途上的難於淸除的磐石。</p>
<p>所以，由於法國民主大革命所啟發的女權運動，光明的前途，仍等於朦朧的遼景，婦女不過處於望梅止渴的把戲中的努力而已。何况，這限於少數的少數婦女之點綴，丨這朦蔽婦女渴求解放的兒獻，於千千萬萬婉轉求生的被壓着的大衆婦女，有甚麽關係呢？</p>
<p>然而，婦女大衆必得認識淸楚：「性」的解放是首先在「經濟獨立！」這一點，不但歷史宣示給我們的是很確切；就是圍繞於婦女日常生活的實際上，也能尋出很多兩性間的不愉快，以及自身之束缚和悲慘，都必要在這一個重要的把握上，求得解决。</p>
<p>我們拿淺明的例來說吧：假使，一個無産的婦女，她能在勞動的工作中換取工資，困苦因此而輕舒，兩關係更能得到自由和愉快的狀况；一個中産的婦女，因職業之獲得，使自己在封建的覇绊裏，會增進她獨立的尊嚴；以及高等婦女，以職業之佔據，不至更深沉的墮落於怠惰的深淵裏。</p>
<p>這都是由於産業革命和民主運動以後的，婦女生活中尋得出的實例。丨她們在「經濟獨立」的努力中，多少是已獲得「性」的自由，和奴隸架銷之毁炸的。身受壓迫的婦女，對於自身悲慘的忍受之結癥，應該以全生命來作本身之診察，而以全生命來把握吧。</p>
<p>解放婦女一切「非人」的狀態，非婦女自己努不可！和奴隸之不能得領主的援助一樣，婦女是不能希望男子的援助，而能從「性」裏解放出來的。</p>
<p>在經濟恐慌，和政治紊亂的今日社會，以婚姻當作職業的手段，這關係，更在顯現不穩和難於可靠傾向了，而婦女仍認爲這是出路，標力在這歧途上急進，這結果，只有更促進這羣婦女愈益趨於低賤；爲挽救這一可咀咒的現象，「經濟獨立」更是迫切所要了解的問題。</p>
<p>從現實生活中，有不少的前進婦女，她們給與我們這問題的答解，最値得注意。她們以勇敢的精神，走出封建鐡鍊綁鎖的家庭，大無畏的鄙棄由風習所成的，專以愚弄婦女的道德，艱苦的，奮鬥的，來在社會的人羣中；第一個縈在她心裏的是對可恥的性的從屬的解脫，而首先謀「經濟獨立」的出路；由於這個認識和把握，她們獲得生活的自由與尊嚴了。看吧，新女性是以怎樣的姿態在生活的？粗陋狹小的居處，和樸儉的日常生活之消費，而包藏着那在單純的外形之内在的要求，是精神向上的追求；在對自身以及對社會的兩重意義上，她們是何等的忍受，和困難確與艱苦相摶戰；或者整天爲生産而勞動，或者爲被壓迫者奔走而呼號，或者從種種職業上滿足她對人生的意義。因此兩性關係，在她們是爲對精神之更健全的前進的結合，她們是以一個「人」的資格，自由的選擇與她志趣和事業之諧和的男子，完成愛的需要。這比之隸屬於經濟隨從的婦女來，丨一方面，由經濟獨立，自由的生活於光明的環境中；一方面，奴隸般的被蹂躪，陰暗沉鬱，或是醉生夢死的催老着她們的歲月；丨那眞是一個何等的生活之差别呵！</p>
<p>雖然個别的經濟獨立，如歷史所顯示於我們的，並不能解放婦女吧，而且，失業的恐慌也正是這個時代掀起的巨浪吧，但在暴風雨的時代來臨之前夜，婦女必須把握住「經濟獨立這個踏入自由之路的環！</p>

<p>— 姚斐</p>
<p>「電影，在文化和敎育上的價値，這是無容細說的，其從業者丨如經理，導演，演員以至股東們，也往往以推進文化，輔助敎育來自豪，在近年，這　向更是明顯，我對於此道是門外漢，對於電影本身聲術的價値，不配說什麽話，可是因爲自己也並非藝術至上主義者，對於電影界的趨向，是很贊成的。</p>
<p>所謂「劇」，不論在舞臺或銀幕上，總離不了「表現人生」和「指示人生」，然而我們的電影界，對於後者，我以爲是简直没有做到他們所應做到的！甚至多少是有意或無意弄到岐途上去了的，我這樣說，並不是一筆抹煞了我們電影界近年的努力，而是巴望電影界要重視自己的使命，珍惜自己的事業，在選擇題材和攝製影片之前，多多考慮一番：使每一片子映初，不要使自己和觀衆都白白地損失掉精神時間和金錢，總要供獻些什麽使人家得到足什麽！我以爲題材内容意識之正確與否，於觀衆的人生前途關係很大，而所費的金錢精力時間却是一樣的，那末，我是以極其虔敬之忱，盼望電影界一致地作其最善之努力的！</p>
<p>閑話且住，請容我檢討一下所謂「女兒經」：</p>
<p>不知是否因爲是今年是婦女什麽年的關係，今年以婦女爲題材的電影眞多！就拿明星公司的出品來說吧：經「姊妹花」，「三姊妹」，「路柳牆花」，一直到所謂「女兒經」，好傢伙，猗歟盛哉！但一究其對於婦女人生的標示怎樣，那是很覺遺憾的，譬如吧：在「姊妹花」裏，不指出私有財産制度之罪惡；貧苦婦女之應當堅决地掙扎着自立起來；而敎一個窮姐姐隨着軍閥小老婆的妹妹去了！在「三姊妹」裏，用「姊妹花」一無的意識，使着姊妹三個伴着老母，去依靠富豪少爺，以致都被他的蹂躪；而且很不合理地以一個温文爾雅的大姐，把孔武有力的富豪少爺打死而去自首完結了！在「路柳牆花」裏，算是把都市的罪惡暴露了，但不指出都市衆惡的根源！呌婦女回到農村去，而忘記了農村久經破産了！至於所謂「女兒經」，是一部導演和演員全部出馬的片子！内容也頗豐富，可是指示了觀衆些什麽呢？祇有天曉得！其意識不惟是一貫的，而且更是每况愈下了，說什麽女兒經！簡直是「奶奶經」哪！請容我往下說：</p>
<p>「女兒經」雖是包括了不少型的婦女，但是前進的婦女是被擯除了的，丨他們那麽以雙十節慶宴開始，以提燈會作结，甚至把一個終身盡瘁國家人民，老病床塌，仍念念不忘國事民衆的像何香凝這一型女性就没有！如此有意去躱避現實，使婦女們看不見自己的前途，只以暴風雨象徴着，而由宣景琳嘴裏說一句，我們要在暴風雨裏找出路，誰懂得是什麽呢？像胡蝶主演的那一叚（包括顧梅羣），簡直没有脫得了公子遇難，小姐打救；或英雄美人大團圓那種舊式傳奇小說的腐臭氣味！革命，是日常不斷地艱苦的奮鬥，没有那末蘿蔓絲式的，這種歪曲事實，說句笑話：或者是有意在開開一般個人革命成功者們的玩笑，那倒是有趣的，可惜我們並不能這樣代爲曲解，其他各叚，是較現實些，然而開映給我們祖母看，很能博些老涙，可是對於現在婦女，實在是毫無用處的，從宣景琳的那一叚，由了色衰被棄，旣成了出走的「挪拉」，自然需要獨立了，但是我們過去以至現在的女子敎育的破産，以及賢母良妻主義之於女子不利，却没有給指示出來，嚴月閑那一叚，所表現的事實，女的之對付男子，完全由於男的追逐别的異性而起，然而結果却給人一個滑頭女人的印像，同樣，徐來的那一叚，先給她一個交際花雅號，跟着描寫出她的浪漫不覊，毫無心肝來，但於男權社會有錢的閑者之追張逐李玩弄女性的罪惡，輕輕地代爲掩飾了，試部這些力氣是用到什麽地方去了？朱秋痕的那一叚，算是暴露資産階級摧殘婦女的情形了，不過也僅僅的消極地描冩，並没有積極地指出婦女的危運，固人類被壓迫者的厄運全係整個社會制度問題，婦女的出路，是要在新的社會　才能得到總解决的，高倩蘋的那一叚，誠然揭穿了所謂上流社會女名流們對於女權運動的目面，也博得觀衆不少訕笑，可是這種現象是偶然的嗎？在一面要求賢母良妻，一面又希望自己的夫人女兒大出風頭的男子一般意識之下，有什麽奇怪？推究起來，在這個不平等的社會裏，到底其咎在誰？然而在這一叚，我們只看見對於女的盡情地描繪，至於男子，却是毫無愆尤的，這大概由於導演與劇作者都是男子的緣故吧！徐琴芳的那一叚，描摹一個嗜賭成癖的女子，終於自殺，呌人對於她多覺的是咎由自取！至於自私的男子慣把女的關在家庭内，不准她有正當交際，不容她有正當娱樂，自己却終日在外狂嫖濫賭，或奔走彙緣，以致女的寂寞無聊，逼到賭博一途去的又被掩飾了！其餘還有夏佩珍的一叚，那是爲影評家所一致推許的，不錯，一個女子，有了貧病交迫的癆病大夫，尙在提携懷抱的孩子，單靠自己播音養活，歲月已够熬煎了，不幸又死了丈夫，失去孩子！眞是人生大悲劇啊！可是社會萬惡至此，人類制度之這樣不堪人類生活，没有被進一步的提示，已覺憾事，不料女子日常生活的一個正當常識，也在這叚被否定了！在這叚劇裏，夏佩珍當看見趙丹同孩子親吻的時候，常識地大聲制止，正爲這事，男的感到人生貧病，到了連自己孩子也不能親近的地步，痛苦的發狂，在風雨中跑了出去，以至於死，當他到吃晚飯仍没有回來的時候，女的後悔極了，從夏佩珍嘴裏對孩子說出這麽一句話·「你要給爸爸親嘴，他就不出去了！」這眞太不該了，失業與貧病，是聯擊着的，根本原因，在於杜會的制度敗壞，已經不適於人生，而他，雖由於被阻止親嘴引起了悲哀，然而阻止親嘴防止傳染却是應該，却不當後悔的！雖則急難裏這種反理智的後悔乃人情之常，我以爲換一句話也一樣能表示出她當時的情緒：「爸爸本來是很好的，給窮病把脾氣弄壞啦！」接着動作，她很可以摟住孩子，繼之以嗚咽！不是更逼眞，更有意義，更動人嗎？</p>
<p>時代是非常嚴肅的，我們一切都需要嚴肅些，可是我們中國一般人的生活習慣等等，實在都太欠嚴肅了！婦女問題，在人類解放途程中之重要，是盡人皆知的，使牠向前或倒退，是一樣需要氣力！企望人生悲劇减少，諒來人同此心，盼禱大家都能把握着進步意識，向前努力去！</p>

<p>— 王憲章作</p>
<p>淸晨，太陽没勁兒的掛在天角上，淡黄的光，裹着每個在路上活動着的人們的週身，微微地感着一點暖意。</p>
<p>一路電車像怪獸般地衝破了太陽光的包圍，停，停在「先施」門口喘着；我急忙從人堆裏像一袋棉花般的車肚子裏擠出來，伸長脖子，吁了口氣，迅快地穿過車頭朝（永安）門口走來。</p>
<p>時候還是那末地早，從那扇高與人齊的玻璃門上看進去，見裏面的三五個顧客遊魚似的帶着探視的眼光蕩着，店員淸閒得祗顧睜着貪婪的眼光，有如顧客賞鑑貨物般地在賞鑑誰是眞來買貨的顧主。</p>
<p>我在他們的眼光迎接中跨進了大門，從南部看到北部，每個部份的女店員都帶着疑問而又是歡迎的表情對我看着，我頓時感着一種「非顧主」的念頭，心裏微微的有點不安起來。</p>
<p>在那許多的眼睛環視中，我迅急地找着了我所希冀的目的地丨「康克令」了；當我靠近那晶瑩的玻璃櫃檯跟前，那裏有位女店員已經先站了起來，滿臉含着笑意歡迎我這個不平凡的顧客。</p>
<p>在不安的狀態下，我首先向她說明了我的來意；這是一個極好的避免使她失望的方法。</p>
<p>當我和她說明了我的希望，她便反問着說；「要這個做什麽？」</p>
<p>「没有什麽大的作用，不過寫出來給一般的人看了，也好使他們曉得女店員是過着怎樣的一種生活。請問女士貴姓是？」我向她解釋了一番，又接着問了。</p>
<p>「夏丨佩君。」她羞澀的把頭低下來，避開了我的眼光，一面在整理櫃檯裏陳設的各種不同的自來水筆。</p>
<p>「在這裏做了好久？對於店員的生活還習慣吧？」</p>
<p>「半年。店員的生活和其他女子職業還不是一樣，也是一個智識勞動者；我覺得自己的能力祇夠幹一個店員，所以對於現在的職業相當的感到滿足。」這時她的話匣子開了：說話的神情顯着從容不迫，彷彿像一個演說家似的，流水般的偉論從她嘴裏滚了出來。</p>
<p>「客氣，客氣！」我笑着說：「女店員的生活恐怕比較地要辛苦點吧？這裏的待遇情形，女士可以告訴我一些麽？」</p>
<p>「可以，這無所謂秘密。這裏的工作時間，說多不多，說少不少，是從上午九時到下午八時，大約是十一個鐘頭，當中有半點鐘是吃飯的時間；吃飯是大家輪流着，一班一班的到五樓「會食堂」裏去吃，女店員大概是屬於三四兩班。」她用手指在玻璃櫃檯上邊說邊畫着，帶着和小學敎師講解一個數學的公式一樣的神情。</p>
<p>「還有！」我接着問。</p>
<p>「酬報麽？」她笑了笑說：「剛進來時是十七元一月：另外還有六天的「補工」，這是要每半年才算一次的。」</p>
<p>「女士做的這個部份恐怕要算最不麻煩的，在這裏？從前這部份有位譚小姐，不知女士認識嗎？「康克令」這部份可說是人才輩出呢？」我笑着說。</p>
<p>「從前在這裏做的我不知道是誰，不過我希望「康克令」儘管出名，然而在「康克令」部份做的人却不必把牠來做幌子。再要說到人才輩出，那更是不敢當受了。如果談到工作的能力，女店員總還是不及男店員的。譬如拿稍爲重點的東西，或者到架子上拿一種東西，這無論在那一部份的女店員，遇到這種工作時，都得需要男店員的帮助的。明白了這種種形，就可知道「康克令」部份的工作也和其他的部份一樣。」她對於我提到「康克令」的話，似乎起了點反感。</p>
<p>「晤！我是說到」「康克令」來的顧客的份了，比較别個部份要來的高尙一點。」我想對她解釋前面的問話，所以我又重複的提到「康克令」的命名了。</p>
<p>「這也很難說。往往　許多自命爲智識　子的本買自來水筆，從他們的言語和行動上看來，多半是帶着某種的奢望才來的。我對這種人的應付的方法，就是除說明貨物的功用及價目之外，一概置之不理；可是，態度却不能修失常。」她說得也忍不住的笑了。</p>
<p>「女士遇着這種顧客時，心裏也曾懊悔過做這店員的職業麽？」</p>
<p>「這並不用懊悔；在中國，女子職業的遭遇，任何地方都是如此的。信我在求學的時代，我已經從文字上和傳說上，對於女店員的生活就有了相當</p>

<p>「從前是在什麽學校裏讀書的，女士？」</p>
<p>「這個可以不說罷？」她偏着頭笑了笑。</p>
<p>「說了也没關係的。」我催促着。</p>
<p>「愛國。」斬釘截鐡似的，說了兩個字。</p>
<p>「畢了業吧？爲什麽不進大學呢？」我似乎很替她可惜似的。</p>
<p>「唔！」她遲疑了一下說：「我覺得大學讀出來了，也並不會增加我在社會多大的地位：假如想研究其種科學的話，又决非僅僅讀了大學就可以成功。在這樣的觀念下，我所以情願做一個女店員而不願做一個高貴的大學生。」</p>
<p>「是的。」我輕微的應着，接着又想起一個問題來說：「女士的私生活也可以告訴我一點麽？」</p>
<p>「這太複雜了，說不了這許多。」她皺了皺眉頭，顯着有點不願的樣子。</p>
<p>「隨便說點罷！業餘以後怎樣消遣消遣？」我笑着問。</p>
<p>我晚上回去，除了把當天的報紙翻着看看之外，就祇有睡覺。有時也和弟弟妹妹們打一盤「哥而夫」：這是不費錢的，而且也可算是一種家庭的運動。」</p>
<p>「影戲院也不大去嗎？」我聽她說了半天，並不曾提到這種消遣的方法，所以又接着這樣的問了</p>
<p>「唔！」她似乎不好意思的說：「去是去的，不過不是每天都去。因爲看影戲旣可以取樂，同時又可說是社會反映下來的敎育，在那裏可學好的，同時也可學壞的：這不過是「仁者見仁，智者見智」，在於各人自己意志純正與否而定，在影戲本身原是没有什麽罪惡的。」</p>
<p>「女士對於自己的將來的趨向，有没有預定的計劃？關於這個問題，可以說點麽？」我態度顯得得嚴肅的問。</p>
<p>「這…」她臉上微微浮起一層紅暈，但是另一個思念馬上就把她羞惡的心理消滅了。她接着很爽快的說：「你問的這問題我曉得，就是說了也無妨。不過我覺得在這時還談不上婚姻的問題；這不僅在年齡上感覺到還早，同時在我理想中的事業上也還距離得很遠。而且一個女子生活的獨立，也正是要在這種時候打好一個根基，將來才不會做一個被動的動物。」</p>
<p>「是的。」我望着她點了點頭。我表示我钦佩她的宏論。我看了看時鐘已經敲過九點。覺得不便再說下去了，便向她說了一聲「對不起，要你費了半天辱舌，謝謝！」</p>
<p>「不要緊，不要緊！」她含着笑看着我出了大門。</p>

<h3 id="c41">藝術與科學 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 雉</p>
<p>在古代社會中，一切社會的意識形態都没有明白的區分，藝術與科學也是一樣，是凝作一團不能分開的。在這時候，一種藝術作品往往我們可以當作一種科學的東西來解釋；同樣，在一種科學的東西裏，我們也可以看出濃厚的藝術意義。例如，有名的埃及的金字塔，這當然是古代的建築藝術，但牠同時又是當時埃及僧侣們的天文學，幾何學，以及關於尼羅河定期汜濫的知識的敎科書。又如「舊約」聖書，其所載的雖是關於天地創生的神話，但這在知識水平尙較低下的三代人看來，却是很眞實，很合理的，可以說是古代的科學，同時，由於其故事的奇妙，文筆的簡潔美好，又可說是那時的一種文學。丨丨由此當可看到藝術與科學在古代實是一個東西，根本是没有什麽區分的。</p>
<p>及至近代，人類的生活内容是更複雜，更豐富了，因而由人類生活所産生的各種意識形態都有了豐富的内容和獨立的形式，都顯示出了獨立存在的姿容：所謂藝術與科學，也就在形式上各自分離而獨立存在並發展了。這時候，藝術是日益借重具體的活生生的形象的力來組織人類的思想與感情，來認識生活，修飾生活，科學也日益借重其抽象的理解的力來認識並指導人類的生活，牠們都在努力發展其各自的機能；而且，隨着産業的發展，藝術與科學的領域也日益擴大了。很顯然的，電影便是在藝術領域中新添的一個部門，其他如音樂繪畫部門之日益增加，也是不容否認的事實；至於科學，其門類更多，過去本是分爲自然科學與社會科學兩大類的，最近更有人再加上一個思維科學，於是就成了三大類，在這三大類之下又有許多部門，在這些部門中還有很多分工，其複雜現象實在不是這樣一篇短文所能闡明的。丨丨這樣，在近代社會中，我們不僅可以說藝術與科學在形式上是分離了，而且還可以說，就是牠們的各個分野也都有其一定的特徴，有其獨立存在的形態的。</p>
<p>當然，近代藝術也絶不是與科學毫無關係的。事實上如寫實主義自然主義的藝術倒是與近代科學密切地結合着的。自然主義的批評家聖佩甫說：「我只有一種興趣，就是分析採擇，我是一個精神的博物學者，我所欲建設的就是文學的自然史。」同時，左拉也說：「我們的責任是分析忿怒和愛，而精確地看淸楚這種種情性怎樣在人類機關中施行牠們的作用。我們的觀點是新的觀點，這個觀點是變爲試騐的而不是變爲哲理的：簡言之，試騐方法：在文學如在科學一樣，是從事於斷定那種從前玄學只加以不合理的和超自然的解釋之個人的和社會的自然現象。」這不是明白表現文藝必須適合科學的說法嗎？實際上，一切寫實主義自然主義的作家，都是客觀地科學地描畫現實的。</p>
<p>但是，近代寫實主義自然主義的藝術之與近代科學相結合，是與古代藝術學科學之結合在一起的情况不同的。無論如何，在近代社會中，藝術與科學在形式上已經分離而各自獨立了，爲實主義自然主義的藝術只是在實質上是與以歸納法爲基礎的近代科學相結合着的，並不是像古代一樣：藝術與科學凝作一團，在形式上不能分開來談論。</p>

<p>戲劇是什麽？哈米爾敦在他的「戲院學說」裏說：「戲劇者，乃所以表現人與人間之意志力的奮鬥，由演員扮演，在台上舉行，有觀衆注視，其表演的力量是感情而非理智，其表演的方法乃以客觀的動作出之。」這雖然也觸到了戲劇的特徴，但却有些籠統和不明顯不具體的缺陷。戲劇是一種文學，要簡切適當地說明戲劇的本質的機能，便非依據文學的定義和戲劇本身所具有的特質不可。如果文學是以文字有時或以動作或以言語爲媒介，借着活生生的形象的力來傳達人類的思想和感情的，那麽，戲劇便是以舞台的表演爲媒介，藝術地，更加現實，更加具體，更加生動地傳達人類的思想和感情的文學。</p>
<p>有人因爲見到有些劇本雖不能在舞台上表演，但也被稱爲戲劇這事實，便謂舞台的表演不能成爲戲劇的一個主要原素。然而這是不對的。問題非常顯然，不能在舞台上表演的戲劇作品，自然亦可稱爲戲劇創作，但是，如果因此便謂舞台的表演與戲劇全無關係，那便是否認了戲劇的存在意義，因爲戲劇是要由演員在舞台上表演給觀衆看的。無論任何戲劇作品，其形式總是與舞台藝術結合着的，無論任何戲劇作品，其中總是有「劇中人」，「現實的境地」……等内容的；至於那作品之是否便利於舞台的表演，則是另一問題。不能在舞台上表演的戲劇作品，自然没有失去戲劇創作的資格，但是與舞台藝術毫無關係的那樣形式的作品，却不能稱爲戲劇創作。涉士比亞有許多劇作，是不易在舞台上表演的，但是倘若這些創作不是由戲劇的形式而是由小說或者詩歌甚至什麽不倫不類的形式構成的，那牠們便没有稱爲戲劇的資格；其所以雖不能在舞台上表演而依然被稱爲戲劇者，是因爲牠們具有與舞台藝術有着密切關係的戲劇所特有的形態。</p>
<p>日本横山有策在其「文學概論」中說：「戲劇因爲是綜合了許多藝術丨丨詩，音樂，繪畫，舞蹈和建築丨丨的複雜藝術，所以是在文學的諸形式中受着最多的物質上的限制的一種形式。」這在一般的解釋上是對的。但倘若由此便說戲劇的形式是凝固不變的，那便是把問題絶對化了。戲劇雖是受着許多物質上限制的一種形式，但其形式却是隨着時代社會的變動而變動的，絶没有一種戲劇形式能支配古今中外的劇壇。很顯然的例證是：戲劇上的所謂「三一律」的形式，這是古典主義認爲金科玉律，認爲一切劇作都非依此形式不可的，但偉大的劇作家莎士比亞却首先出來對之加以破壞，而且還因此得到了偉大的成功；法蘭西的浪漫主義者更對之揭起了鮮明的反旗，有名的雨果在其長篇史劇「克倫威爾」的序言中亦對之盡量諷剌和嘲笑；……丨丨由此可見戲劇在形式上雖有許多限制，但這限制却非固定的，而是隨着時代社會的變化而變化的。</p>
<p>因爲戲劇是更直接，更現實，更具體，更生動地傳達思想與感情的，所以牠與社會的關係也就特别明顯。一種成功的戲劇作品，都必然顯明地表現着一種社會意識，而爲一羣社會人所擁護。誰都知道，在法國文學史中有一個有趣的故事，卽丨丨當雨果的有名劇作「歐那尼」在巴黎法蘭西劇塲上演時，古典派的作家們都坐在劇塲的樓上及其他地方，吹着口笛，以妨害演技；而浪漫派的作家及同情於他們的靑年則聚集在樓下正廳中防備着，有名的郭偕更是穿上了令人注目的紅色背心，披着長髮在台下指揮他們的一切同志；這是很顯明地表示着戲劇與人類社會之關係是如何的深切。</p>

<h3 id="c44">德國博士特往問訪西班牙底四指人 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 吴伯倫</p>
<p>每隻手只有四個指頭</p>
<p>這樣的人有好幾十個</p>
<p>西班牙瑪德里通訊</p>
<p>在西班牙伯脫拉沙村，有一家呌哈挪拉阿的人家。他們是這村中的領袖，差不多可以說是這村中一切實權的掌握者。他們底祖先，幾百年前是一城之主，是稱壩於埃及和亞拉伯一帶的英雄。倘若你現在到伯脫拉沙村中去訪問哈挪拉阿底家庭，你還可看見他祖先許多魁偉的畫像。</p>
<p>不過，在當時這些英雄的畫像中，却有一點是不可思議的，卽是，在他們的畫像中總是没有露出手來。這在對於這家人的情形不了解的人，自然不會如何詫異，不過正因爲現在哈挪拉阿一家人的手指和足指都比普通人少一隻的關係，所以，就有些令人奇怪了。現在哈挪拉阿一家人，上至八九十歲的老人，下至四五歲的小孩，每隻手和每隻脚都只有四個指頭。因此，人們就推想到，恐怕他們底祖先也是四個指頭的吧，不然，何以他們的畫像上都没有把手畫出來呢？</p>
<p>若是當時英雄的祖先們都是四個指頭，那麽，這就是非常有趣的一個問題，這種情形正和遺傳學上門德依爾底法則一樣的了。不久以前德國古行耳，久斯特博士曾赴伯脫拉沙村去訪問題哈挪拉阿的一家，並將訪問的經過在德國新聞雜誌上發表，因此，大大的引起了全世界的注意。</p>
<p>據說：現在哈挪拉阿一家的家主，是一將近九十歲的老人。他很巧妙的管理着這一村莊，無論村中發生了什麽事情，一般的百姓便會跑到老人的家中，詳述事件的始末，於是老人用四個手指撑着下顎，很高興的聽着他們說話，最後再用三言兩語去吩咐這些百姓。</p>
<p>哈挪拉阿老人的兒子，自然每隻手都是四個指頭，就是他底兒媳也是如此。因爲在哈挪拉阿一家人有個規矩，凡不是四指的人，都是不許與結婚的。事實上又有甚麽普通人願和這種四指的男女結婚呢？所以，這個村中的四指人很多，大小男女在這一血统之下，差不多有好幾十人，而且在村中佔着很大的勢力。</p>
<p>這樣，人們就會懷疑：也許哈挪拉阿家在幾千年以後會逐漸發展而造成一種獨特的人羣，或成爲一獨立的國家也說不定。不過，這未免是一種過慮，因爲他們比普通人的生産率小而死亡率大，也許幾千年後他們再也不會存留於人間了。不過，無論如何，在現在，他們的存在却是一種非常奇妙的事情。</p>

<p>戲劇的内容與形式自然都要受時代社會的嚴格規定，但牠對時代社會還有反作用；而且因牠能以舞台爲媒介，直接地傳達人類的思想與感情，所以其對社會的反作用也特别的重大。牠能使人歡笑，哭泣，狂呼亂呌，甚至可以轉變人的思想而直接影響於社會。法國宫庭劇之對於專制主義的維護作用，中國舊劇之撑持中國舊社會的力量，都是可以顯然看到的。</p>
<p>各國生産建設事業</p>
<h3 id="c45">蘇聯的公共食堂 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 博文</p>
<p>公共食堂是轉變小我的個人經濟到大規模社會化的社會經濟的一個重要步驟，這在婦女方面尤其顯得重要，因爲這可把她們從家庭的苦役中解救出來，俾便去從事工業和農業方面的生産勞動。公共食堂的重要也不光是限定在改善勞動者及其家庭的生活狀况上，牠的重要是更可以在增加生産能力，提高工資和加速生産過程等等方面見到的。</p>
<p>在第一五年計劃時期中，這種公共食堂事業已有了龐大的發展。在一九二九年正月，據最切近的統計，蘇聯已有一千五百個公共食堂，每日能供給二百二十萬位的客餐。在一九三三年，公共食堂數已增加到一萬五千四百七十六個，每日能供給的餐食也增加到三千萬管。四年中，公共食堂數已增加了十倍以上；客餐則增加了十三倍以上。</p>
<p>到今日，已有百分之六十五到七十受僱於國家工業機關的工人就食於這種公其食堂。其中，金屬業工人佔其總數百分之七五，礦工佔百分之六二點五，建築工人佔百分之七四，運輸工人佔百分之六八。每個工塲，個個礦山，每個大的機關，都有牠自己的公共食堂以熱的飲食供給工人們。</p>
<p>這種發展與蘇聯工業技術進步及機械化是分不開的。新的巨大的工塲和礦山的建立與開發，是使小規模的手工業食堂改變爲大規模的公共食堂的一個重要原因。過去的一些小食店小酒館已不復存在了，代替的是一種有力的新工業丨公共食堂事業了。</p>
<p>公共食堂中規模最大的是一種廚房工塲。在一九二九年正月這種工塲全蘇聯只有三個，每日只能供給六萬客的飲食。到一九三三年，廚房工塲已增加到一百零六個，每日能供給的飲食，也增加到三百三十一萬六千客。成千成萬的小規模的公共食堂自然也是年年在增加着的。</p>
<p>此外，因爲這種公共食堂的發展，各種食用器具的製造工業，例如番薯的削刀，切肉刀，洗碗器，打汽爐等的製造，也都已興起來了；而這些器具從前是只能用手工業生産的。</p>
<p>有了這樣的物質和技術基礎，在第二五年計劃期中，這種公共食堂事業的發展當然是不成問題的。現在最重要的問題是怎樣再多建立些廚房工塲和怎樣在現有的廚房工塲裏附帶添設些生産半製造品食物的工塲這兩件事。蘇聯必須更大規模的機械化的生産食物方能適合牠當前的需要。這接觸到食物的質的改進的問題，也是决定蘇聯公共食堂事業前途發展的問題。這種對於食物的質的改進的問題，現在已成爲一個十分重要的問題而被注意着。現在的的確確有許多公共食堂十分注意食物的質的精美，努力使食物滋養及美味，並注意怎樣纔能更適當地爲工人顧客服務及留心淸潔等事。政府爲了鼓勵這些，對於各個成績好的公共食堂曾頒給奬賞，例如莫斯科，列寗格勒，多巴斯等地的許多公共食堂就得過這種奬賞。許多小規模食堂都以這種食堂爲模範，在努力着改進食物的素質。</p>
<p>經騐指示他們，食物精美適口與否，這一大半幾乎是烹飪技術上的問題。烹飪專門家是必需的。現在各大廚房工塲都注意着高級技術人才的養成，其中如高等廚歸，食物化學家及經濟學家等的養成，都有頗可觀的成績。舊式的廚師以自己嘗味的方法備辦食物，但他們在蘇聯現在是全無需要，全無地位的。</p>
<p>關於廚師的訓練，在以前，卽使在最漂亮的餐館裏，也只是一種學徒制的私人烹調技術的傳授，但現在可就不同了。在一九三一年聯邦公共食堂托辣斯已在莫斯科，列寗格勒，盧加斯克三處開辦了三個訓練高級烹調技術人才的專門學校。這種學校完全是别開生面的，而其目的當然就是訓練高等廚師，食物化學家和經濟學家等。</p>
<p>除了這些專門學校之外，蘇聯現在還有二十四個烹飪的技術學校，共有學生六千二百九十七人；九十三個初級技術學校，共有學生一萬六千八百三十三人。後者是訓練出來備辦中級和較次的食品的。</p>

<p>木刻畫的發源是在中國，這是不能否認的。它歷史的久遠，據研究者的考察，也不次於繪畫。然而這門藝術，這中國的産物，却被遺棄了許久。復興，還是近年來的事。</p>
<p>經過時代的演進，木刻藝術已是瘋狂的盛行於西歐各國，以及東亞日本。它的祖國，也有許多愛好者在研究，刻製了。</p>
<p>它丨丨木刻，能以人類視綫的幻覺所根本存在的原色丨丨黑白丨丨來表現一切景像的綫條，所以它能在藝壇上佔得了重要位置。</p>
<p>中國，各報章雜誌的介紹，使我們知道了他們丨丨從事木刻者丨丨的努力，各地的展覽也給我們一些印象和剌激。於今，華北作者許崙音肇野等，發起全國木刻聯合展覽，預定新年中在平首次舉行，繼之到天津，南京，上海等處連續展覽，以木刻藝術廣播於全國。　　　　他們的通訊處是由北平北辰報社第五號信箱轉全國木刻聯合展覽會籌備處。作品之徴集，不限人數與量數，惟需十二月二十五日前寄到。</p>

<h3 id="c48">憶李石岑先生 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 振玉女士</p>
<p>李石岑先生死了，這至少是中國學術界中的一大的損失！</p>
<p>我和石岑先生祇有數面之緣，也許那時在他心目中對我並没有什麽印像；這原因是在與他接觸的靑年人太多，要想對每個人見過一兩次面就能記住他的面孔，實在是很不容易。可是，石岑先生所留給我的印像却是特别的深刻，永遠使我不會忘懷；這並不是說他臉上有着與人不同的特徴，容易使我記住，而是因爲他有一種爲人所不及的風趣，在我記憶裏劃了一個不滅的憧憬。</p>
<p>我初次認識石岑先生，是在新中國學院；這個學院是被「一二八」毁滅了的中國公學的一部份敎職員和學生共同組織起來的。石岑先生因爲與這裏總務科的胡耀楣先生有點朋友關係，所以在那時新中國學院雖然窮到常常不能發薪，石岑先生還是照常準時上課的。我和胡君是同鄕，在没有事可做時便常溜到他那裏談天；有一天就這樣無意的遇見了石岑先生了。當時我並不知道這位剛跨進門的便是中國有數的哲學家，因爲他穿着一身半新不舊的洋服，並不高大的身材，驟然看去，實在不像是一個學術邃深的學者。後來胡君替我介紹，我才知道這就是因他寫給童女士的一封萬言書，使我憧憬已久的李石岑先生。我們第一次握手之後，祗隨便拉雜談了幾句話，他先走了。從這次起在我記憶裏便刻上了他的深刻印像；胡君後來又告訴我他在新中國學院担任哲學，每週來兩回，假如我没有事，可在他上課時來聽講。</p>
<p>我接受了胡君好意，在他上課的那天特别起了一個早，匆匆趕到新中國學院。一踏進課堂，見到裏面的座位已經黑壓壓地塡滿了；在這許多學生當中，竟有一半是學别的東西而慕名來聽講的。我到那裏已經快九點鐘了，我一看没有座位，便祗好　一處空隙　好，　摸過了十多分鐘的光景，石岑先生挾着一個黑色皮包跨進來了。課堂裏喧囂的空氣，經他一進來之後，就好像水洗過了一樣，靜寂無聲；每個學生都沉默地懷着熱望的眼光，把他送上了講台。</p>
<p>這天他講的是「哲學概論」，講到後來聽講的人更多了。在平時新中國學院的任何敎授上課，没有超過三十學生，這天可說差不多全體都到齊了。</p>
<p>他講哲學時的態度，是時莊時諧的。在聽他演講的人，當時都會感到時間的短促，好像並没有多久他的課就完了；其實是他的敎授得法，才會使人聽了不生厭倦，所以後來有許多學生没有上他的課的都改選他的課了，那些已經在上他的課的也都要求學校當局加多他的鐘點，但後來因學校經費困難，學生們的要求到底是不曾實現！</p>
<p>聽說還有一次最有趣了：當他授課時，同時别的敎授也在授課，可是後來這位敎授的學生一個個地溜到他這課堂裏來聽他的哲學了，這位敎授却感到　大的難堪。學校當局後來爲敷衍别的許多敎授的面子起見，特别把他的授課時間改在不與任何敎授同時，免馠坻生們再閙臨陣脫逃的玩意兒。</p>

<h3 id="c49">再會吧上海 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 允平</p>
<p>我對於這「再會吧，上海！」的希望並不很高，所以當我走出了金城的大門，我是感到稍稍满意的。中國的新生電影，難然因爲種種關係，使製作者們不能完全按照自己的意思從事工作，但牠的成長和進步，却是顯而易見的。卽就這「再會吧，上海！」來說，接觸現實的鮮明描寫雖被省略了；但作者的意圖到底不可抹煞，而這一影片在技術上部分的成就，也是値得一提的。</p>
<p>首先我不妨說到導演的努力。導演在這裏並未運用新的手法，但他對於旣成的導演技術則頗多理解。我們不能因爲他在剪接上的若干失當和字幕的濫用而忽略了他種種相當優美而靈活的鏡頭。特别値得提出來說的，是輪船擱淺時用快速度拍攝的幾個角度不同的驚擾鏡頭，和主人翁到上海後到王家前速寫着街車的奔馳，以示路程及時間的過往，從這些地方都可看出導演有相當的聰明與經騐。都市夜景的挿入，也頗足以造成都市繁華及主人翁當前困難處境的氛圍氣。導演曾相當適當地運用過推鏡頭，俯攝，複攝等鏡頭，這也是使畫面相當活潑可看的一個原因。</p>
<p>表演上阮玲玉的演技雖不怎末特出，但也没有不稱職的地方。劇本所要求於她的，她是盡了力的。她在内心表現上更有値得一提的成績。她在喪子時，當舞女時的愛與恨及内心苦悶的情感，都能不過火而適當的傳達着。張翼無戲作，他的没有什麽好成績，與劇本本身頗有關係。何非光的反派脚色却是演來很不錯的。</p>
<p>自然，這「再會吧，上海！」還不是一部怎末成熟的作品。導演技術的某程度的成就和演員個人的努力，决難彌補整個作品的缺陷。爲這個作品的致命傷的應該是故事的不妥。在故事本身的發展上我們發現了不少難於令人相信的牽强不眞實的地方。缺乏眞實感是一個作品失敗的主要關鍵。「再會吧。上海！」太多利用了偶然和巧合之點，是使牠不能獲得較高評價的一個理由。開始用輪船擱淺引出阮玲玉和張翼的關係，這種展開故事的方法到底有點不自然。輪船擱淺，旅客丢行李入「海」中，也像是兒戲似的。至於白露到王家後「凑巧」因長途跋涉患着傷風，以引出她的被吳光輝强姦，以及後來孩子病危二房東代爲延醫，來的醫生又「正」是吳光輝丨這種用「凑巧」和偶合之處作爲故事發展的根據的辦法，實在是極笨拙的。此外，如主題的暧昧不明，劇作者的没有勇氣正視現實及其創作態度的軟弱，也都是觀衆不能從這裏取得什麽的一個原因。任何作品，卽使技術上有若何高的成就，但若忽略了内容的健康，則决難適合現時代當前的需要。「再會吧，上海丨」就是要在這樣的條件下失掉牠的重要性而會很容易地在觀衆的記憶中褪去顔色的。</p>

<p>寂寞雲房午畫長。一腔愁緒爲潘郎。相思品充西江月。風流筆墨赴佳章。情切切。懶洋洋。荷輕檯易入夢魂鄕。玉腕託腮朦朧睡。定晴偷眼意心荒。秀才看到消魂處。抱著腰肢還呌不妨。萬種柔情皆爲你。顯遭一病入膏育。秦樓有意吹蕭客。今日何方跨鳳凰。抄常頓變芙蓉臉。讀書人說話太荒唐。奴三寳皈依知命苦。你但來風月進芸房。奴當許里去訴姑娘。仙姑呼你情詞引誘良家子。出醜撣門你有何面龐。幼女回心吉士誘。半推半就效鸞凰。來了那進安頑仆折鴛鴦。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Commemorating the Commencement of the Qiantang River Bridge <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Qiantang River's surface is vast, its tides turbulent, its riverbed filled with shifting sands, making construction extremely difficult. Since the founding of the Republic, plans to build a bridge have been repeatedly proposed and abandoned. This is because the project is immense and difficult to execute, and raising the necessary funds is no easy task. Furthermore, successive administrators of Zhejiang Province’s construction efforts have often been hampered by the constantly changing political situation, preventing them from completing the project. As a result, the bridge construction proposal was further delayed until Mr. Zeng Yangfu took charge of the Construction Department. He revived the old proposal, gathering experts for careful study and actively seeking funding. After much difficulty, the project was finally put on track. Recognizing the significance of the bridge, we published a special article urging its realization. On this occasion of the groundbreaking ceremony, we are deeply pleased that our long-held wish has been fulfilled and feel boundless joy.</p>
<p>Mao Yisheng, the head of the Bridge Construction Office, once said that the main objectives of building the Qiantang River Bridge are threefold: (1) to allow the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to directly reach Hangzhou and connect to Shanghai for export; (2) to extend the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway from Hangzhou to Baiguan to complete the line; and (3) to connect the highways of eastern and western Zhejiang. All of these are factual and far from the empty talk of current construction planners. Therefore, we are pleased to elaborate on their meaning.</p>
<p>(1) Zhejiang Province has long been known as a fertile land in the southeast. However, due to its natural topography, it is divided into eastern and western sections. The Jinhua-Quzhou area in eastern Zhejiang has rapid streams and surrounding mountains, resulting in unsophisticated customs and obstructed transportation. To remedy this, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was built. The railway has now reached Yushan in Jiangxi Province to facilitate trade between Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Soon, it will be extended westward from Yushan to Nanchang and Pingxiang to connect with the Nanxun and Zhuping Railways, serving as a prelude to linking the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. (The loan for the Yushan-Pingxiang Railway, amounting to 16 million yuan, was recently signed, with all funds to be delivered by the end of the 24th year. The Nanyu section will be completed and opened to traffic by then. The Ministry of Railways is also meticulously planning the connection between the Guangdong-Hankou and Pinghan Railways.) Once the Qiantang River Bridge is completed, it can be linked with the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, connecting to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and forming a trunk line within the southeastern system. Goods and travelers from the four provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang can then directly reach Shanghai by rail, significantly benefiting the national economy.</p>
<p>(2) The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been in operation for over twenty years, but the section between Hangzhou County and Cao'e has never been built, forcing traffic to and from western Zhejiang and the hinterland provinces to detour through Shanghai by sea or through Shaoxing by inland waterways. This wastes both money and time and has an invisible impact on transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou. The section between Ningbo and Cao'e, being isolated from the system, is even more affected. Now that the Qiantang River crossing project has begun and the loan agreement for completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has also been formally signed, these two major unresolved issues of many years can be resolved simultaneously. As stated in the annual report of the Chinese-British Bank, "A sharp increase in the railway's revenue in the future is expected." Furthermore, the Suzhou-Jiaxing branch line, which links the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, is also scheduled to begin construction this year. In the future, local products from the Hangzhou-Ningbo section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway can be transported to the provinces of North and Central China via the Qiantang River Bridge and the Suzhou-Jiaxing branch line. This will save time and avoid congestion, offering immense benefits. (3) Zhejiang Province already has 3,400 kilometers of operational highways, and the planned highway network can be considered largely complete. However, the highways in eastern and western Zhejiang are separated by the Qiantang River, forming isolated sections that are difficult to connect, which is regrettable. Furthermore, the section of the Beijing-Fujian Highway from Hangzhou to Fujian and the section of the Shanghai-Guangxi Highway from Hangzhou to Jiangxi are both hubs for highway connections in the southeastern provinces and are included in the highway network of the seven southeastern provinces, making them of utmost importance. Without the connection provided by the Qiantang River Bridge, these sections would be isolated, diminishing the overall highway transportation plan. Since the launch of bus services on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing-Hangzhou national highways, Hangzhou has become a central hub in the highway network of southeastern China. We sincerely wish to leverage Hangzhou's existing advantages to complete the highway system of the seven provinces, which cannot be achieved without first building the Qiantang River Bridge.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are pleased to learn that the funding for the bridge construction has been secured. The total cost is estimated at four million yuan, to be shared equally by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department. The Ministry of Railways' two million yuan portion will be jointly invested by a syndicate formed by the Chinese-British Bank and the nationally operated Construction Bank at a particularly low interest rate (reportedly only 5.5%, compared to 6% or 7% for previous loans). This is because the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have achieved remarkable results in improving their operations in recent years, making the syndicate willing to invest. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department's two million yuan portion will be entirely borrowed from Shanghai banking groups, demonstrating enthusiastic support reminiscent of the fundraising for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. These two facts show that today's Chinese and foreign societies have far greater faith in China's state-owned enterprises than before. As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." The completion of the Qiantang River Bridge can serve as a model for government agencies undertaking construction projects in the future.</p>

<p>Exchange Rates: The foreign exchange market in London was quiet this morning. Authorities did not intervene with the Exchange Equalization Fund. The opening exchange rate between British pounds and U.S. dollars was $4.99125, 0.375 lower than yesterday's closing rate. Fluctuations were minimal throughout the day. The closing rate was $4.9925, 0.125 higher than the opening rate.</p>

<p>Cotton and Wheat: The cotton market in New York opened steadily, with prices up 2-3 points. Sales were absorbed entirely by traders. Foreign buying interest remained strong. Prices continued to rise. Within an hour of the opening, they were up another 2 points. It is reported that the authorities' decision regarding next year's cotton acreage will depend on the cotton farmers' opinions on the Bankhead Act.

It is reported that European buying activity was very active yesterday. Many believe that traders are now gradually understanding the possibility that important trends will develop; (2) according to news from Washington, the authorities now intend to change some of the new measures along a more stable outline. This news has attracted attention. Unfavorable factors for the market are that although the French political tensions have eased somewhat, the difficulties of the "Gold Bloc" cannot be said to have disappeared. Securities opened this morning with mixed market conditions and prices fluctuating. The fact that there were profit-taking activities after yesterday's surge was expected. However, in general, people believe that the current trend is indeed upward. The New York securities market prices are listed on the left:</p>

<p>France Threatens to Send Troops to Saar</p>
<p>Germany Lodges Protests with Britain and France Respectively</p>
<p>League of Nations Publishes Report of Saar Governing Commission</p>
<p>Proving Various Conspiracies of the German Front</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government, regarding the possibility of France sending troops into the Saar, instructed its ambassadors stationed in London, Paris, and Rome to lodge protests with the governments of their respective countries. This morning, German Ambassador to France Koster also visited Foreign Minister Laval, informing him of the German government's interpretation of the League of Nations resolutions of 1925 and 1926 (which state that if the Saar Administrative Commission deems the police force insufficient, it may request the presence of troops stationed near the Saar border to enter the Saar and assist in maintaining order). The Foreign Minister also received French Ambassador to Germany Ponsot to discuss all outstanding issues between France and Germany. This was the first meeting between Laval and Ponsot since Laval took office. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) German military envoy to Britain, Hirsch, met with Foreign Secretary Simon. According to German sources in London, Hirsch's meeting with Simon was to protest against France sending troops into the Saar. British officials responded that the events Germany was concerned about were unlikely to occur, so there was no need to be alarmed in advance. Since Germany itself had guaranteed that the Nazi Party would not take any action within the Saar, the Saar Administrative Commission would not request France to send troops into the Saar. British officials also stated that if unforeseen circumstances arose and the Saar Administrative Commission deemed the Saar police force insufficient, the Commission would have the right to request France to send troops to the border to assist in maintaining order, in accordance with the League of Nations resolutions of 1925 and 1926. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Secretariat today published a lengthy report on the activities of the "German Front" in the Saar. The report was compiled based on documents obtained during a search of the organization's headquarters. It stated that the "German Front" was merely an expansion of the Nazi Party and detailed the various acts of oppression perpetrated by the organization, the most well-known of which was the threat of "wait until after 1935." The report also mentioned the threats made through newspapers and German radio, as well as boycotts and the misconduct of German authorities. It concluded that the organization was able to rely on the assistance of many Saar officials and the support of the German government and authorities to carry out its oppression. At the same time, according to news from Paris, Knox, Chairman of the Saar Governing Commission, has requested the League of Nations' Saar Plebiscite Preparatory Committee, currently meeting in Rome, to increase the number of international police in the Saar. Furthermore, due to the possibility of troops being deployed in the Saar, the German government has lodged a protest with the French government, requesting France to explain the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution on the Saar issue in 1926, as the French attitude is based on this resolution. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>The three-member committee on the Saar issue in Rome held its fourth meeting today. Knox, Chairman of the Saar District Administrative Commission, did not attend. The committee is reviewing the financial and economic difficulties of the Saar District and is considering the views of both the French and German representatives. It will hold its final meeting tomorrow. However, it is still uncertain whether the committee will submit a report to the League of Nations immediately or only present some important resolutions first. (National Telegraph dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>The Mystery of the German Disarmament Representative Visiting London</p>
<p>Is He Negotiating a Return to Geneva?</p>
<p>Causing Speculation Among British Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) Ribbentrop, who previously represented German leader Hitler in various countries on the issue of disarmament, is now in London. The Labor Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, reported that Ribbentrop's visit was to negotiate Germany's return to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference under certain conditions. The Conservative Party's newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, made a similar speculation, stating that Germany's extensive rearmament policy has caused economic hardship and diplomatic isolation, which Germany is aware of. Therefore, Germany may want an opportunity to return to Geneva, but without abandoning its fundamental demand for equality in armaments. The Daily Telegraph also stated that some in London are prepared to acknowledge Germany's rearmament as a fait accompli and to re-discuss the security issues of various countries on this basis. However, the government's perspective is not yet known to the general public. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Ribbentrop, representative of German "Leader and Chancellor" Hitler, will meet with Lord Privy Seal Eden at the Foreign Office on Monday, presumably to discuss disarmament issues and Germany's relationship with the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) General Hamilton, a famous British general in the European War, recently gave a speech in Glasgow, saying, "In my opinion, how the Germans govern themselves is Germany's internal affair and has nothing to do with us. What I care about is what kind of people they are. If someone hunts tigers in Europe, I will definitely hold a gun and hunt with the Germans. I don't want to hunt tigers right now, but if something happens, I am willing to follow those who hold guns and resolutely shoot accurately," etc. (National Telegraph dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Germany Expands Aviation</p>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party's Daily Mail published an article on Germany's strength in aviation, stating that the number of aircraft Germany produces each year is equal to the total number produced by all other countries in the world. The Tesow City is now building the world's largest aircraft factory, which will be completed this month. The new factory will have 30,000 workers. It is estimated that by the beginning of next summer, Germany will have an average of 35,000 aircraft, all of which are the latest models with extremely high speeds. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>France and Belgium Jointly Hold Armistice Commemoration</p>
<p>(Paris) For the sixteenth anniversary of the European War armistice, veterans from France and Belgium will jointly hold a commemoration. On the Belgian side, King Leopold III will personally light a torch at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which will be carried by veterans through the provinces that were once battlefields to Paris. On the French side, a torch will also be lit in Paris and follow the same route to Brussels. Both are scheduled to arrive on the same evening. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Germany Practices Austerity</p>
<p>Implements Price Controls</p>
<p>Foreign Imports Sharply Reduced</p>
<p>(Berlin) The newly appointed German "Price Dictator" gave his first speech to the public today, saying, "You should wear your clothes until the last thread is worn out," and urging housewives not to doubt substitute materials. He said, "Today's substitutes may be tomorrow's trendy products. We must know that our country is a poor country and cannot buy much." He continued, stating that his first task would be to investigate the most important aspects of clothing and food. After this, no private hoarding would be allowed, and new prices could not be set for various items without his permission. He also opposed all attempts to control prices in various industries. He concluded by saying that Germany currently has enough coffee and tobacco to last for one year. According to statistics released today, foreign goods imported into Germany in the past three months have decreased by 30% compared to the same period last year. This is largely due to commercial restrictions. Wool imported from Australia decreased by 62%, from South Africa by 27%, and cotton imported from India also decreased by 25%.

<p>Content of Austro-Hungarian Talks</p>
<p>Vienna: Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Gömbös returned from Rome, stopping briefly in Vienna to meet with Austrian officials near Semmering. Official sources remained completely silent, stating only that Gömbös's stop in Vienna was purely a private matter. However, in reality, all key Austrian government officials attended the talks. The Austro-Hungarian talks involved three matters: (1) the trade situation between the two countries; (2) resolving technical issues related to this trade; and (3) general political issues. Tonight, Austrian newspapers strongly clarified the proposal for simultaneous economic and political rapprochement between Hungary and Austria. This sentiment reflects the impression felt by public opinion. It is worth noting that Gömbös's visit to Italy and Austria has further consolidated the alignment of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, while recent rumors of Gömbös traveling to Berlin have been denied and are fading.

<p>Inside Story of Naval Negotiations</p>
<p>British and Japanese Collusion in Secret</p>
<p>Japan Attempts to Induce British Support for Naval Equality with Commercial Preferential Rights</p>
<p>United States Closely Monitoring Developments</p>
<p>(London) The impression that naval negotiations are closely related to the active and secret activities of government commercial agencies has become strong in London today. The sudden increase in Anglo-Japanese economic and political activity initially did not raise suspicion, but the frequent exchanges between naval negotiation representatives and government commercial experts and senior officials led to rumors, which have been partially confirmed. One aspect of this story that can be revealed is that Japan is vigorously trying to induce Britain to agree to naval equality with certain commercial preferential rights. According to reliable sources, Japan has promised to grant Britain important commercial rights in "Manchukuo" and to revise plans for the "Manchukuo" oil monopoly and the oil control within Japan. The British Foreign Office and Board of Trade are currently considering this. According to other sources, the commercial conditions that Japan is using to exchange for British sympathy on the naval issue are not limited to revising the oil control. It is said that Japan has also promised to vigorously limit its competition with the British textile industry and other export industries in the world market. The U.S. representatives at the London conference do not believe the news of this Anglo-Japanese collusion, but are closely monitoring the development of this matter. If Britain actually agrees to the proposal of naval equality, the U.S. will be in a position to oppose Japan's naval demands independently, which may affect Sino-U.S. trade relations and shake the balance of power in the Pacific.

<p>Trends in Naval Negotiations</p>
<p>Japan's Attitude Becomes Assertive and Dissatisfied with British Proposal</p>
<p>Expressing Determination to Advance Towards Established Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After receiving the contents of Prime Minister MacDonald's armaments reduction compromise proposal via telegram, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of the Navy will immediately hold a joint meeting to study Japan's response. It is said that the Navy Department's policy is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Any compromise proposal that deviates from Japan's established policy or nominally advocates equality but actually maintains the ratio system will be decisively rejected.</p>
<p>(2) Japan firmly believes that only the Japanese proposal can achieve a fair and appropriate armaments reduction agreement, and will advance single-mindedly in order to implement the established policy.</p>
<p>(3) Japan's claim for equal military strength is not a matter of appearance or form, but a matter of extremely important fact. Therefore, Japan cannot accept a compromise proposal that recognizes rights and continues the current ratio. (Domei dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Japan Expresses Appreciation to Britain</p>
<p>New Hope Transmitted from London</p>
<p>(London) It is expected that at the beginning of next week, Japan's response to the British compromise plan will be friendly, injecting new hope into the current situation of the naval talks. It is said that after receiving detailed instructions from his home government, the Japanese chief representative Yamamoto will express to Britain his appreciation for the suggestion of allowing Japan naval equality. However, objections will be raised to the suggestions of "reorganization of quantity and quality" of the categories of battleships and auxiliary vessels, and the requirement that each country should notify other countries of its maximum naval needs. Although Japan is not satisfied with the British proposal, it does not want to cause difficulties with a negative reply. Therefore, another question is raised: how will naval needs be determined? At the same time, U.S. representatives are quietly awaiting the outcome of the negotiations between the British and Japanese representatives. All developments are reported to the U.S. representatives at any time, but no opinions have been solicited. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>The United States Will Have a New Plan to Maintain the Current Ratio</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain put forward a new policy in the preliminary arms reduction talks in an effort to find a compromise, but the United States did not think so and will also put forward a new proposal for a compromise. The content of the new proposal is predicted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In principle, it is believed that the existing ratio should be extended for a certain period after the expiration of the London and Washington treaties, but it is prepared to recognize a part of the amendment to the existing treaty. (1) Although the total tonnage doctrine is inappropriate, due to the particularity of the national defense of the contracting countries, it is considered that there is a flexibility in adopting an equalization system within a certain range. (1) In any case, oppose the next meeting exceeding the limits of existing forces. (1) The United States cannot recognize Japan's proposal to reduce British capital ships to 75,000 tons. (1) Because of humanitarianism, it is proposed to abolish submarines altogether. (Jiji dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Hanging a Sheep's Head While Selling Dog Meat</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Minister Rejects British Proposal</p>
<p>Believes there is Absolutely No Room for Consideration</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Naval Minister Osumi went to the exercise site before 12:20 this afternoon to accompany the review of the army's major exercise. When he set off in the car, he told reporters as follows:</p>
<p>The navy's request for budget revival for the next fiscal year is scheduled to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance today. However, before I return to Tokyo on the 14th, negotiations will be conducted between the administrative authorities. However, judging from the current situation, in order to establish a sense of national defense security, the revival of 90 million yen is absolutely necessary. When accompanying the review of the major exercise, I will also meet with Prime Minister Okada to request understanding. If the compromise proposed by the British side in the London talks is as generally transmitted, it is equivalent to hanging a sheep's head while selling dog meat, so there is no room for consideration on the Japanese side. Therefore, Japan can only rely on international justice to try to thoroughly establish a claim for fair, appropriate, and equal rights. In addition, the forthcoming special session of the Diet should explain some of the contents of the arms reduction talks. These talks and the naval budget are like the two wheels of a cart, so it is necessary to wait for the enthusiastic support of the people. (Dentsu dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>American Experts Observe</p>
<p>Difficult for Japanese and American Opinions to Compromise</p>
<p>(New York) Arms expert Pierre today published an article in the monthly report of the Foreign Policy Association, saying that if the United States is willing to make important concessions and set a specific policy, the preliminary naval talks in London may have a hope of success. The problem encountered in the London negotiations lies in whether a new way of naval agreement can be obtained. On the one hand, it satisfies Japan's desires, and on the other hand, it does not constitute British and American recognition of Japan's repeated violations of the agreement recently. If Washington can admit that although the United States is disgusted by Japan's recent aggression, it does not agree to use the U.S. Navy to drive Japan out of China, then there may be hope. Pierre continued, if Japan does not occupy the Philippines, there is little possibility of war between Japan and the United States. If the United States can abandon its naval ratio system and the concept of superior naval bases and adopt the theory of national defense navy, the peace in the Pacific may be maintained.

<p>International Treaties Become Waste Paper</p>
<p>The United States Only Relies on Armaments</p>
<p>A World War Is Imminent</p>
<p>Replenishing National Defense Is an Urgent Priority</p>
<p>U.S. Acting Naval Commander-in-Chief Calls Loudly</p>
<p>(Washington) Acting Naval Dispatch Commander Woodward declared here today that so many treaties have become waste paper that the United States now relies only on the army and navy. The United States has been unprepared for war for a long time. At this critical moment, it is an urgent priority to continue to make legitimate national defense. War crises are lurking in several places on three continents, and the situation in Europe is even more tense than in the Far East. (National Telegram dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Publishes Booklet</p>
<p>To Promote Demands for Equality</p>
<p>Entitled "National Life and Disarmament"</p>
<p>The Tokyo correspondent of China United News Agency reports that the Military Popularization Department of the Ministry of the Navy issued a booklet in early October entitled "National Life and Disarmament I." The contents roughly stated that the Japanese Navy is very inferior. Once war breaks out, it is difficult to guarantee the safety of the Japanese Empire. In order to maintain peace in East Asia, Japan must have naval power equal to that of Britain and the United States. In addition, the progress of national life and the development of trade can also be achieved by relying on naval power, etc. It did not mention domestic economic issues, so it did not attract the attention of political and financial circles.</p>
<p>U.S. Fleet</p>
<p>All Return to the Pacific</p>
<p>The U.S. fleet in California, San Pedro, has been conducting exercises in the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean for seven months. Today, it returned to its home port on the Pacific coast to be stationed. The relatives and friends of the fleet personnel were waiting here for the battleships and transport ships to drop anchor. Destroyers, submarines, and other auxiliary ships entered the port of San Diego last night, but naval officers and soldiers did not go ashore until today because of customs clearance and government inspection. An investigation found that the U.S. fleet departed from the west coast on April 4 via Hawaii, heading to Australia and New Zealand for large-scale exercises and long-distance cruises. The reconnaissance fleet, which was formerly based on the Atlantic coast, also returned to the Pacific this year and will participate in next year's exercises near the Alaskan Aleutian Islands. Washington believes that the return of the reconnaissance fleet to the Pacific will not arouse suspicion among the world, but naval officers said that they intend to keep the entire fleet stationed in the Pacific to wait for the situation to change. The so-called situation refers to the Far East. That is to say, during the period when the Joint Fleet remained in the Atlantic, submarines and other auxiliary ships patrolled the defense line from Alaska to San Diego without interruption.

<p>(1) Box Type: Only needs to align the latitude and longitude. By putting on the listening device, one can immediately know where there is a large wind or fog, and where the sea surface is safe. Therefore, the navigator can operate without any danger. (2) Nautical Mile Reporting Device: Traditionally, the number of knots traveled by a ship had to be calculated by the crew. However, this device reports the traveled distance in nautical miles as it goes, providing instant information at a glance. (3) Alarm Telephone: The bridge has a direct telephone line to the engine room, shipowner's cabin, accounting room, and other special locations. In case of danger, one can immediately twist the switch to communicate with all locations.</p>
<p>Lifesaving Tool</p>
<p>There are a total of eight lifeboats on board. Traditionally, launching lifeboats required chopping ropes with an ax and then pushing them to the outer hull manually. Now, one can use a hand crank for automatic launch. The deck is also equipped with multiple rescue climbing barrels. They are four-sided, with countless handles on all sides, and filled with air. They float upon entering the water, and those who fall into the sea can grab onto them at any time, eliminating the risk of losing their lives. The ship is also equipped with the latest type of life jackets. Traditionally, life jackets are rigid and easily cause abrasions to the body after entering the water. The new life jackets are shaped like connected pillows, soft and comfortable. Once worn around the neck, they do not sink in the water. Each deluxe cabin is equipped with several pieces. The radio room is equipped with both long and shortwave radios, allowing communication with coastal radio stations.</p>
<p>Elegant Passenger Accommodations</p>
<p>The ship's bottom level is the cargo hold. The first floor has ten second-class cabins, six first-class cabins, one large second-class dining room, and one large third-class steerage area. The third-class steerage has a total of fifty-six berths, all double-layered. Behind is the business staff's office. The second floor contains the kitchen, chief steward's room, business director's room, chief engineer, second engineer, third engineer, and other rooms, as well as a machine testing room. The main kitchen is also on the second floor. In the middle is a lounge, with six bedrooms on both sides, along with a cloakroom and servant's room. Additionally, there is a large first-class dining room, which is very spacious. There are also three special rooms for government officials to travel. The deluxe cabins are in the style of a postal ship, constructed with heat-insulating materials on all sides.</p>
<p>Maiden Voyage</p>
<p>The first departure is scheduled for the 14th, from Shanghai to ports in South China. The ship's navigation department has an additional third mate, currently filled by Xu Hanqing, and an additional third engineer, appointed as Yan Yi. The ship's length, tonnage, and other details have already been recorded in this newspaper and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>Construction Bank of China</p>
<p>Invests in the Gan River Hydroelectric Plant</p>
<p>Principle Approved, Detailed Plan Still Under Study</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, contacted the Construction Bank of China to negotiate investment in the establishment of a hydroelectric plant. Song Ziliang, General Manager of the Bank, immediately went to Nanchang with engineers to discuss the matter. Gong Xuesui, Director of the Department of Construction, accompanied them on a site inspection. The Provincial Government initially proposed that in addition to official and commercial shares, it hoped the Bank would invest 1.7 million yuan, for a total of 3 million yuan. However, after surveying and estimating, it is feared that this would exceed the budget. Song Ziliang, in principle, approved the investment in the hydroelectric plant. After returning to Shanghai the day before, he studied the Nanchang hydroelectric plant plan with Executive Director Bei Songsun and others yesterday morning, and discussed investment matters. The amount of investment has not yet been determined. As for the interest rate, time limit, and all other conditions, they have not been finalized and will be decided after the Bank studies the hydroelectric plant plan.</p>

<p>Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Opening the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway Line</p>
<p>The Entire Project is Divided into Three Sections</p>
<p>Survey Teams Have Been Sent to Measure</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Suzhou and Hangzhou are famous scenic spots in the Jiangnan region, with more tourists than anywhere else. Therefore, the income from passenger transport on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways consistently exceeds that from freight transport by more than half. The passenger cars on the Shanghai-Nanjing line from Suzhou to Shanghai and on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line from Shanghai to Jiaxing are particularly crowded. In view of this, the Ministry of Railways has opened another Suzhou-Jiaxing line, starting from the Suzhou station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, going down along the canal, and ending at the Jiaxing station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, with a total distance of 75 kilometers. A Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway Engineering Office has been specially established to handle it. The entire project is now being overseen by Chen Sicheng, an engineer from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways. The entire line, starting from Jiaxing, has been divided into three sections. Zhu Bingliang, engineer, is in charge of the first section from Jiaxing to the 12-kilometer mark; Xiang Zhida, engineer, is in charge of the second section from the 12-kilometer mark to the 49-kilometer mark; and Shen Shao, engineer, is in charge of the third section from the 49-kilometer mark to the 75-kilometer mark. All construction is planned to be carried out in sections in order to expedite it. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have approved the Ministry of Railways' request to instruct the local county governments to provide assistance at any time. It is also heard that the Real Estate Department of the General Affairs Office of the two railways has sent survey teams to measure the land to be purchased in detail, household by household, in order to assess the price and purchase it.</p>

<p>General Review of Disaster Relief Exercise</p>
<p>Finalized and Announced Yesterday by Mayor Wu</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the general review of the disaster relief exercise held in this city on November 3rd was finalized and announced yesterday by Mayor Wu. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The disaster relief exercise in this city was held on the evening of the 3rd of this month. Approximately 20,000 people were mobilized, and the exercise lasted approximately four hours. In general, government officials and community organizations lack this kind of experience. Due to the lack of materials and the short preparation time, everyone was able to exhibit a spirit of striving and wholehearted dedication under unified command in the arena. This truly possesses the essential conditions for disaster relief and is highly commendable. The opinions of each reviewer regarding the detailed actions of each item are hereby published separately below as a lesson for future exercises.</p>
<p>First Item: Flood Rescue</p>
<p>(Location) Near the Yong Sheng Wharf in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, the banks of the Huangpu River, and the Gaojiabang South Bank of the China Merchants' Wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong. (Deployment) Dongjiadu was in charge of a unit of the Public Security Bureau, a unit of the Water Police, and a unit of workers from the Public Works Bureau. Yangjiadu, Pudong, was in charge of a unit of the Public Security Bureau, a unit of the Security Corps, a unit of student teams, and a unit of workers from the Public Works Bureau. The specified construction was one meter high, fifty meters long, and one meter thick. (Time) Work started at 12:30 AM and was completed at 4:00 AM. (Reviewers) Tan Wenqing, Zhang Yusan, Zhang Renchun, Yang Maorong, Wei Hua. (Comments) The compilation of the rescue team by Commander Wen Hongen and District Commander Zhang Mingqin, consisting of engineers from the Public Works Bureau, police, civilians, and students, demonstrated a model of cooperation in the face of emergencies. The middle school students in Pudong were particularly commendable for their bravery and vitality. Although the Security Corps lacked training, they were still able to work hard in the rescue efforts. The remaining actions were somewhat slow. Because the work of carrying soil is not easy to achieve if one is not usually well-trained in practice.</p>
<p>Second Item: Firefighting</p>
<p>(Location) Next to the World Grand Theater on Qingyun Road, Zhabei. (Deployment) A unit of the Public Security Bureau, a unit of the Security Team, the Zhabei Fire Brigade, a unit of the Zhabei Security Corps, a unit of the Boy Scouts and student teams, and three buses from the China General Omnibus Company. (Time) Upon hearing the fire alarm at 12:30 AM, the participating personnel arrived at the scene within five minutes, began spraying water within two minutes, and extinguished the fire completely within twenty minutes. (Reviewers) Li Duchu, Dong Zhihe. (Comments) The various actions during the exercise were relatively quick and coordinated. However, security was somewhat lacking, and the prior preparation of the site did not seem to suit the situation. However, the Fire Brigade, Boy Scouts, and Police Security Team all fully demonstrated a spirit of bravery and agility.</p>
<p>Third Item: First Aid</p>
<p>(Location) Xinmin Elementary School on Datong Road. (Deployment) A unit of Health Bureau staff and ambulances from the Red Cross, as well as some personnel, a unit of the Security Team, a unit of the Public Security Bureau Police, a unit of the Zhabei Security Corps, a unit of the student team and Boy Scouts, and three buses from the Shanghai-Tai Automobile Company. (Time) Upon hearing the alarm at 12:30 AM, the various military police and participating groups arrived at the scene of the accident in the shortest possible time to carry out rescue work and were finished by 2:30 AM. (Reviewers) Li Tingan, Du Gang, Bao Qitong, Dai Shiyao. (Comments) The actions of the first aiders were commendable, and the first aid methods were appropriate. However, there was a lack of earnestness and tension. Also, the habit of keeping to the left while walking on the road was not cultivated, which seems to be a major obstacle to action during an emergency. The Health Bureau's first aid was appropriate, and the Xinmin students playing the injured were realistic and commendable. Fourth Item: Repairing Traffic</p>
<p>(Location) The first bridge on Zhongshan Road, Xujiahui, and the military telephone line from Maogong Bridge to Fenglin Bridge in Longhua. (Deployment) A unit of staff and workers from the Public Works Bureau, a unit of the Signal Corps of the Songhu Garrison Command, a unit of the Security Team, a unit of the Public Security Bureau Police, and a unit of the Security Corps. (Time) Upon hearing the alarm at 12:30 AM, work began. The construction of the wooden bridge was completed at 4:00 AM. The installation of the telephone line began at 2:00 AM, and the distance of about 4,000 meters was completed in just 20 minutes. (Reviewers) Liu Yongzang, Chen Zhiyi, Wu Zegai, Zhang Jintang. (Comments) Although the bridge repair work on Zhongshan Road was relatively quick, the transportation of wood was somewhat slow due to the distance from the work site. It is feared that the bridge does not meet the requirements for load-bearing vehicles. The installation of the telephone line was similar to wartime operations, with lively and quick movements and good discipline.</p>
<p>Fifth Item: Suppressing Riots</p>
<p>(Location) The area between the Xundaokou Police Station and the Confucian Temple Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. (Deployment) Defense: A unit of the Public Security Bureau Police General Corps, and the police from the Xundaokou Police Station and the Confucian Temple Police Station. Attack: A unit of the police academy. (Time) 12:30 AM to 5:00 AM. (Reviewers) Li Guangzeng, Guo Shiwu, Li Huiyun, Mei Xueyan. (Comments) The spirit of both the attackers and defenders was good, and their enthusiasm was particularly commendable. However, both had advantages and weaknesses. The attacker's advantages were that the plan was relatively thorough and the means of deceiving the other party were skillful. The defender's advantages were that the deployment was quick, the reports were prompt, and the handling was appropriate. The attacker's weaknesses were that they were too bold, unrealistic, and lacked flexibility. The defender's weaknesses were that the inspection was not strict enough and the defensive deployment was sparse and uneven.</p>
<p>Sixth Item: Arresting Wanted Criminals</p>
<p>(Location) The area of the Ximen Branch of the Public Security Bureau. (Deployment) A unit of the Ximen Branch Police of the Public Security Bureau, and a unit of the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau. (Time) 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM. (Reviewers) Tang Futian, Liu Huai. (Comments) The precautions were relatively strict and orderly. However, the guard at Huangjiaque Road discovered the fleeing criminal's car, but one suspect escaped and the car was driven away. It seems that coordinated actions were not swift enough and attention was not paid in separate directions.</p>
<p>In Summary</p>
<p>This exercise was an unprecedented undertaking, and the results were naturally not entirely satisfactory. Although the participating units all worked hard together and fulfilled their responsibilities, it is a pity that the time was rushed and publicity was not sufficient, so that many citizens still lacked a proper understanding of the meaning of disaster relief, which is somewhat regrettable. However, analyzing it (1) The student teams and Boy Scouts served in various disaster areas, especially demonstrating their brave and agile actions and the spirit of serving the community. (2) The water and electricity company, telephone bureau, and telegraph bureau were all able to prepare for work and listen for orders throughout the night, even though they had no exercise items, which is in line with the principles of mobilization. (3) The Red Cross and Red Swastika Society each formed rescue teams in advance to participate in the exercise, not shying away from hard work, and deeply understood the essence of managing charitable and public welfare causes. (4) The various car companies allocated commercial vehicles to be dispatched and were able to understand the meaning of requisition during martial law. (5) The fire brigades in each district voluntarily practiced emergency deployments and prepared for disaster relief in areas where there were no assigned exercise items, which is also commendable. (6) The staff of the Municipal Government, the Headquarters, the Security Office, the Gendarmerie Regiment, and the Security Corps either practiced transporting important official documents or practiced emergency gatherings that night, which also suited the situation. (7) The deployment of military police posts in patrol inspections revealed shortcomings of uneven density, with too many places where manpower was wasted and too few places that were not strict enough. This should be carefully considered and properly arranged. Reserve teams should also be deployed at all key points to prepare for unexpected events. More patrol teams should be sent to patrol remote areas in order to be thorough. (8) When guard police inspected vehicles and pedestrians, they ordered all passing vehicles and pedestrians to stop for inspection. This method was inappropriate and hindered traffic and affected order. Sharp attention should be paid to those who appear suspicious and inspection carried out. If there is nothing suspicious, they should be released as usual, and the inspection must be swift. (9) This exercise was held at night, so various signals and passwords were prescribed. When the signal could be recognized, there was no need to ask for the password again. However, the military police often recognized the signal on the vehicle and the armband on the arm, but then asked for the light number password, which made the procedure too cumbersome and wasted too much time, and should be corrected later. (10) The Public Security Bureau's riot suppression item lacked agile deployment for both attack and defense. The defenders dispatched too many security troops and should have gathered them at appropriate locations to support each other in order to prevent those who feint in one direction from taking advantage of the opportunity. The attackers should use feigned attacks to draw the defenders' forces to one place and then break through their weak point, seizing the opportunity to occupy it. If they are dispersed and stealthily attacked, they will fall into the disadvantage of being defeated one by one and will inevitably be bound. Such are my views. I hope that comrades from all walks of life will offer more criticism of this exercise so that it can be improved. I am deeply grateful for this.</p>
<p>Women's Organizations in This City</p>
<p>Delegate Conference Today</p>
<p>Bin Yuan Delegates to Go to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Telegram to Women Across the Country to Support</p>
<p>Women's organizations in this city, such as the Chinese Women's Movement Alliance and the Shanghai Women's Association, believe that Article 239 of the revised Criminal Code is unequal to men and women. They have responded to the women's community in Nanjing to rise up in opposition, publish a telegram, and request women across the country to advocate together. It is scheduled to hold a city-wide women's organization representative conference at 2:00 pm today at Wuben Girls' School on Huangjiaque Road to discuss (1) whether it is necessary to organize a Shanghai women's alliance to strive for legal equality; (2) whether each group should form a petition group to go to Beijing, etc.</p>
<p>Heading to Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>As for the six petition representatives pushed by the Women's Progressive Association, etc., Liu Yuliming, Yang Zhigao, Wang Duanzhu, Chen Lingyi, Jin Guangmei, and Qiu Xisheng, they will travel to Beijing by special train tonight and petition the Central Government tomorrow. It is also planned to attend the Central Political Council to petition and instruct the Legislative Yuan to declare it invalid, and it is also planned to invite Ms. He Xiangning to go to Beijing to petition.</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Government The representatives are prepared to submit a document to the Central Executive Committee of the Central Government when they enter Beijing, saying, "Report on the amendment of Article 139 of the Criminal Code by the Legislative Yuan, which violates the Party program, and Article 221 to encourage adultery, requesting a joint declaration of invalidity, and instructing the National Government to instruct the Legislative Yuan to re-promulgate laws based on the principles of equality between men and women and the protection of young girls to protect women's rights and respect the Party program." It is believed that this time the Legislative Yuan revised the Criminal Code, apart from the old and new, all groups hope that the regulations on the current Criminal Code, Article 56, which stipulates that a married woman who commits adultery with someone shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years, and the adulterer shall be treated the same way, which are unequal to men and women, will certainly be revised to conform to the spirit of the Party's rule. Who knows, it is greatly wrong. The legislators repeatedly use the current Criminal Code as a standard, and with their feudal consciousness, they still seek to impose a one-sided obligation on women. Although the sentencing is reduced to less than one year, the principle is that the husband has the right to sue, but the wife does not. The difference between men and women is great and extremely unfair. It violates Article 12 of the Party's program on domestic policy and Article 6 of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. Even a three-year-old child knows it. Even if people across the country are silent, can the people of this Party turn a blind eye? As for the current Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, which states that "whoever commits adultery with a girl under the age of sixteen shall be considered rape" is consistent with the Civil Code, which stipulates that the marriageable age for girls is sixteen. However, this time the Legislative Yuan revised Article 221, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, and changed the age of sixteen to fourteen. It not only conflicts with the current Civil Code, but also deprives young girls of protection and makes adulterers escape their guilt. The legislative intention is close to encouraging adultery. Considering the spirit of the legal system, it is completely contrary to each other. This Association is deeply concerned about the Legislative Yuan's revision for the Party's governance and for the danger of the rule of law. I humbly think that your Association will use the Party's governance to implement the rule of law and strive to spare no effort. For these legal provisions that violate the Party and encourage adultery, it should not be allowed to exist under the Party's rule today. The decision is made, but there is no news. This Association is deeply worried and cannot remain silent. In addition to sending representatives to the capital to petition, I hereby submit this petition to your Association to allow the Legislative Yuan to declare Article 239 and Article 221 of the revised Criminal Code invalid in accordance with the provisions of Article 84 of the Provisional Constitution, and to instruct the National Government to instruct the Legislative Yuan to re-promulgate legal provisions based on the principles of equality between men and women and the protection of young girls to protect women's rights and respect the Party's program. I cannot help but wait for orders with the utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Women's Community</p>
<p>Public Information to Women Compatriots Across the Country: It is stipulated in the Party program, policies, and the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage that men and women are equal before the law. This time, the Legislative Yuan passed Article 239 of the Amendment to the Criminal Code, "A married woman who commits adultery with someone shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year, and the adulterer shall be treated the same way," but there are no explicit provisions for a married man who commits adultery with someone, which is obviously unbalanced. Also, Article 221, Paragraph 2 of the Amendment to the Criminal Code stipulates that "whoever commits adultery with a girl under the age of fourteen shall be considered rape," which is two years lower than the current Criminal Code, which is also excessive. This kind of legal provision is nothing more than a guarantee for feudal forces and a tool to destroy the crime of adultery. Moreover, it will encourage adultery and harm society. The members of this Association are determined to fight to the end against this law that violates male adultery equality and goes against human physiology, and will not stop until the purpose of amendment is achieved. This matter concerns the happiness of our 200 million female compatriots. We hope that everyone will rise up together, pool our efforts, and fight to the death to jointly support us, wash away this strange insult. In addition to sending representatives to Beijing to petition, we respectfully send this telegram to inform you. We hope that you will be informed. Sincerely, Shanghai Women's Progressive Association and Chinese Women's Movement Alliance.</p>

<p>Meeting Minutes of the Rent Reduction Association in the Southern District</p>
<p>Second Registration Held</p>
<p>Lawsuit Filed in Court for Rent Reduction</p>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee of the Nanshi District of Shanghai City recently noted that more than 5,000 households of tenants who requested rent reductions had stored rent for more than three months and had sent letters to landlords to postpone the resolution. Yesterday, an emergency meeting was held in the committee's auditorium. More than 100 representatives of branch associations attended. Zhao Shijing was elected as the chairman. It was unanimously decided that if the landlords ignore the facts and try to sue for rent arrears, they will directly file a lawsuit in court for rent reduction in accordance with Article 442 of the Civil Code. Moreover, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle the rent reduction dispute in Shanghai, but there has been no concrete expression. Therefore, merchants and residents in the district have registered with the committee one after another, requesting that the municipal government be urged to publish it as soon as possible in order to avoid adding to the embellishments of business closures and bankruptcies during the Chinese New Year. The minutes of the meeting are excerpted below: (1) More than 500 merchants and residents in Pudong jointly petitioned the South District Rent Reduction Association to establish a Pudong branch association, and set up a registration office at 54 Renji Road, Dongchang Road, Pudong. The resolution was to forward it to the Party and government organs and the municipal council, and to provide spiritual and material assistance to the Pudong branch association. (2) Those who have requested rent reductions for more than three months and have stored money in the bank have requested the Association to file a lawsuit in court for rent reduction in accordance with the Civil Code. The resolution was that the Association should send a letter to the landlords who request rent reductions. If the resolution is postponed, a lawsuit may be filed in court to order the landlords to reduce the rent. (3) Merchants and residents have come to the Association one after another to request that the municipal government be urged to resolve the rent reduction case. The resolution was to hold a second registration this month. All those who request rent reductions can join in order to report the high rent to the Party and government organs, so as to achieve a general solution in the near future. (4) More than 30 out of 100 branch associations in this region have successfully reduced rents, and 20 have been divided by landlords. The rest of the branch associations are working hard to struggle. However, such a delay is not a blessing for the local area. How should it be handled? The resolution was that, in addition to those who have resolved it, those who have been divided by landlords should be ordered to reorganize. The rest who have delayed making a decision should file a lawsuit in court for rent reduction in accordance with the Civil Code. (5) The date for holding a city-wide petition for rent reduction by all citizens in the district was set. The resolution was to report to the Party and government organs first and then verify it. (6) The resolution on the address of the rent reduction registration office was that those who have set up branch associations should register with the branch association. If there is no branch association, they can directly register with the South District Rent Reduction Association within the South District, and the deadline is the end of this month. (7) The real estate of more than ten companies in the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange on Minguo Road has been fully resolved after the Association sent a letter. Dozens of companies in Nanrenanli, Zhabei, have joined the Association, and the lawsuit for rent reduction has been declared successful in court. The resolution was to send a letter to the landlord to thank him. The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Facilitates Visits to Famous Caves in Yixing</p>
<p>Yixing's Shanquan and Zhanggong Caves</p>
<p>Scenic Spots Can Be Enjoyed in One Day</p>
<p>Yixing's Shanquan and Zhanggong (also known as Gengsang) caves are famous historical sites in the Southeast. Shanquan Cave is divided into four caves: upper, middle, lower, and rear. The rear cave is steamy like a bath.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yixing Gengsang Cave Interior (Photographed by Wang Kai) <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>pot, its depth is immeasurable. Outside the cave, cliffs overhang, and flying springs gush forth. In the past, people praised it as a fairyland. Zhanggong Cave has two caves, front and rear. Inside the cave, large caves encompass small caves, like large camps encompassing small camps, also known as a wonder. Recently, Mr. Chu Nanqiang, a local resident, invested a large sum of money to manage and renovate it. The content of the cave is now more beautiful and complete. The strange rocks are ferocious, and the atmosphere is ever-changing. Being in it, one's spirit is refreshed. Now, Mr. Chu will host lantern receptions in the two caves from the 11th to the 20th of this month, an extremely rare opportunity. According to reliable information from the Two Roads Administration, the bureau actively promotes visits to the cave and will provide as much convenience as possible to all visitors. Those traveling from various places along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway can take any train on the Beijing-Shanghai line to Wuxi, transfer to a bus, and then travel there. Those departing from Shanghai can take the Shanghai-Beijing special express train departing from the line at 8:00 a.m., arrive in Wuxi at 10:39 a.m., transfer to the Xiyi Highway bus, and arrive in Yixing in about two hours. Then, transfer to the Chuanbu Two Caves bus to reach the two caves directly. For the return trip, you can depart from Yixing at 5:30 p.m., return to Wuxi, and transfer to the Beijing-Shanghai special express train departing from Wuxi at 8:01 p.m. to return to Shanghai.

<p>It is said that the Yousheng Travel Agency in Shanghai can provide services for these passengers on this route. Those traveling from other stations along the two lines can contact the Wuxi Railway Hotel after arriving in Wuxi. Recently, several people from Shanghai have been staying in the area to visit the caves every day, traveling in a continuous stream. It is expected that in the future, there will be even more visitors every day.</p>
<p>Nanyang Tobacco Company Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>Quorum Not Met, Meeting Adjourned</p>
<p>The 10th of this month was the date for the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company's annual shareholders' meeting. It was stipulated that the meeting would be held at 2:00 p.m. At that time, because the shares present did not reach one-third of the number stipulated in the original articles of association (i.e., 250,000 shares, the meeting was declared postponed twice). Waiting until after 3:00 p.m., it was found that the number of shares present was only 16,319, accounting for 8,453 voting rights, which was still far from the number of shares required by law to be present. Therefore, the chairman, Mr. Zhou Chouchen, announced the adjournment of the meeting. It is said that the company will set another date in the next few days, re-advertise the announcement, and convene the meeting.</p>

<p>Continued Acquisition</p>
<p>Accomplice in Smuggling and Murder Case</p>
<p>Yu Songnian Vehemently Denies</p>
<p>Trial Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Zhou Maoxian, Lin Xiaogui, and Wang Weichun, bandits from Jiangbei, along with Lao Yu and others, broke into the home of a woman named Zhou Yi at 4 Huatong Lane, North Xizang Road, at around 7:00 a.m. on December 3rd of last year, and robbed her of property worth over one hundred yuan in silver. The Chinese and Western detectives from the responsible police station rushed to intercept them. In a panic, they fled into Kulun Road in Zhabei, where police officer Zhang Liankui, number 2073, tried to stop them and opened fire, but was fatally wounded. Subsequently, the Hongkou police arrested and brought Zhou, Lin, and Wang, the three bandits, to the First Special District Court. Zhou Maoxian was sentenced to death, Lin Xiaogui to eight years in prison, and Wang Weichun to seven years. Zhou appealed to the Supreme Court, but the case has not yet been concluded. On the 15th of last month, Zhang Yunjian, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu police station, learned that Lao Yu (i.e., Yu Songnian), from Qingjiang, was hiding in the Huashang Hotel on the Minquan Road in the Chinese Concession, working as a tea server. He then joined forces with detectives from the local Public Security Bureau and secretly went there to arrest him. He was brought to the Third Criminal Court, but he firmly denied the charges, claiming that Lao Huang had informed Zhang Bingcheng (who has already passed away), a detective in the Hongkou police station, and Inspector Wei Jinfu, who then apprehended Zhou and the other three bandits. Therefore, Zhou held a grudge and falsely accused him. As for the shooting of police officer Zhang on Kulun Road, he was ordered to summon witnesses for verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen opened the court for continued trial. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that there were witnesses, including Chinese Inspector Wei Jinfu, police officer Zhou number 2062, and convicted criminal Wang Weichun, to testify. According to Inspector Wei, he did not know the defendant. Detective Zhang Bingcheng reported the case to him, and he then informed the Western Inspector. He did not know the identity of the informant. Police officer Zhou stated that he was on guard on Kulun Road at the time and saw the three bandits fleeing in a hurry. He recognized the person who fired the gun as Zhou Maozi. Wang Weichun said that there were five people in total, including Lao Yu, someone surnamed Wang, Zhou Maoxian, Lin Xiaogui, and himself. However, he could not confirm whether Lao Yu was the defendant. Yu Songnian denied the charges. Judge Xiao ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>

<p>The board of directors of the Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society has recently made great progress in both construction and medical services. The central area of East Jiaxing Road still needs two months to be repaired. Economic Credit Cooperative</p>
<p>Holds One-Year Anniversary</p>
<p>Invited Newspaper Reporters to the New Headquarters Last Night</p>
<p>Reported on Past Work and Future Plans</p>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative is celebrating its first anniversary today. A tea party for cooperative members was held at the new headquarters at 918 Edward Road at 8:30 a.m. this morning. A variety show was held at the Golden Grand Theater in Baxianqiao in the afternoon. Last night at 7:00 p.m., reporters from various newspapers were invited to the headquarters. During the meeting, Chairman Zhang Shouyong presided over and delivered a speech, followed by General Manager Qiu Hanping reporting on the overview of the past year and future plans. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Overview of the Past Year</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the company has been established for a year. In this year, we have truly experienced countless hardships, relying on an indomitable spirit to strive forward. At times, we have been comforted by the help of various sectors, such as the enthusiastic promotion of the political and media circles. Now, taking advantage of the anniversary opportunity, we will make a brief report on the company's affairs, first to review our own past and lay the foundation for future work, and second to make society understand and thereby obtain loyal guidance from the outside world. The company's affairs are divided into several points as follows: (1) Membership and Number of Shares: As of the end of October, the company had a total of 1,026 members, which is in line with the company's original target. However, the number of shares is slightly lacking. (2) Publicity Work: During this year, we held an economic cooperation movement and published special issues in major newspapers, which aroused the attention of people from all walks of life. In addition, we also published the Economic Cooperation Monthly and the Economic Cooperation Weekly in the Morning News. Later, due to duplication, the monthly was changed to a newsletter, specializing in reporting company news, which has been published to the fifth issue. (3) Undertaking Businesses: Since the company's purpose is economic cooperation, we have done our best to do anything that can directly or indirectly benefit the members. In general terms, there are legal, medical, scientific, and other advisory committees. Regarding further education, we not only provide guidance but also find ways to provide free education for the children of poor members. This summer, Chairman Zhang and General Manager Qiu founded Huahai Vocational High School, on the one hand, to train cooperative talents, and on the other hand, to provide free admission opportunities for the children of members. (4) Member Rights: After joining the company, in addition to the above-mentioned benefits, there are also preferential purchase methods. This is not only beneficial to the members but also very beneficial to the merchants. In the past, members did not receive any discounts when they went to stores to buy goods. Now, they suddenly get a discount, and the benefits obtained are equivalent to an extra income. (5) Loan Situation: The company sets aside one-tenth of the members' savings, and the rest is invested in social undertakings that are beneficial to society. According to the investment regulations, members' loans account for 40%. Because the monthly income is more than 2,000 yuan, the distribution is not much, so that there is often not enough for lending. (6) Income and Expenditure Situation: The company's expenses can be said to be entirely based on the shares of the basic shareholders. For the members' savings, only one-tenth is used for reception centers, dormitories, advisory committees, etc., and the other nine-tenths are entirely invested for the benefit of the members. The company's largest expense is rent, plus police donations, water, electricity, and telephone costs, which average 450 yuan per month. Regarding staff salaries, only low-level staff receive salaries. Several staff members have sacrificed their salaries, which are several times higher than those in the outside world, to engage in the hard work of the cooperative. This is very admirable. The expenses, except for one-tenth of the Savings and Longevity Fund, are borne by the basic shareholders' shares and their interest.</p>
<p>Future Work Plan</p>
<p>When it comes to the work plan for the coming year, in addition to continuing the unfinished work of the past, we have formulated the following points: (1) Seek cooperative comrades, especially pay attention to (A) small business people, (B) teachers and staff, (C) workers and shop assistants, etc. For shop assistants and apprentices in old-fashioned shops, because their income is very small, we now want to formulate a plan so that shop assistants can also enjoy the benefits of cooperation. (2) In terms of publicity and cooperation, in the past, our publicity methods were through various daily newspapers and the company's publications. For entire booklets, they have not yet been printed. Next year, the publicity for cooperation is intended to focus on the practical aspects, and it is planned to study various practical problems and methods, compare their gains and losses, and publish individual booklets. (3) Edit accounting and bookkeeping books for cooperative societies for purchase by various cooperative societies, so as to achieve neat and unified results and save various cooperative expenses. (4) Expand the reception center. (5) Establish offices. In the past year, in response to requests from people in various places, the company first established offices in Xiamen and agencies in Surabaya and Minli, Dutch East Indies. This year, it plans to establish offices in Nanjing, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou to seek contact and promote the company. (6) Seek basic shareholders. The company's basic shareholders bear double the responsibility. The initial company fund was 50,000 yuan. It is now planned to reduce the number of basic shareholders next year, hoping to reach 100,000 yuan. (6) Convene cooperative meetings to discuss implementation plans, so as to gather ideas and broaden benefits.</p>
<p>Today's Variety Show Program</p>
<p>The company will hold an anniversary meeting at 10:00 a.m. today at the company's headquarters at 918 Edward Road, and a variety show will be held at the Golden Grand Theater in Baxianqiao at 12:00 p.m. The Silver Moon Dance Troupe is invited to perform. The Silver Moon Troupe has been well received by the public in this city. At that time, there will be a lively scene. The program is recorded as follows: Conductor, Ms. Zhang Chan'e. (1) Overture, Snow White Concert. (2) Doll Dance, eight people. (3) Goodbye Paris, starring Wang Ren and Li Jun, performed by all. (4) Red Face Army, thirteen people. (5) Viennese Nights, Feng Feng, Feng Zhu. (6) Dawn, Feng Zhu, Hu Dieying. (7) Spanish Dance, Feng Feng. (8) Youth Music, six people. (9) Lilac Mountain, Feng Feng, Feng Zhu.

<p>Completed. A temporary place has now been rented near the road corner to equip medical and recreational equipment. A nurse inspector is currently employed there. The lady will visit rickshaw pullers' families to find ways to improve their living conditions. The board of directors has now also rented a house on Daxin Road in Xinzha to run the second central district. The location is very close to Zhabei. The house is currently being planned for renovation. Before it is completed, a temporary place is also rented nearby. The board of directors' entire work in the future has now been assigned to the committee to draft a plan.</p>
<p>Patriotic Martyrs Association</p>
<p>Memorial Ceremony for Pan Hongsheng Today</p>
<p>The Aid Patriotic Martyrs Committee specially published a memorial oration for patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng yesterday, and a public memorial ceremony will be held today.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Martyr Pan</p>
<p>Patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng, 22 years old, from Wuxi, used to be an apprentice at the Fufeng Paper Store on Edward Road. During the January 28th Incident, he participated in the Shanghai Citizens' Volunteer Army and went to Baoshan to resist the Japanese invaders. After the Shanghai battle was resolved, he returned to Shanghai. Because he was indignant at the unscrupulousness of the traitorous merchants, who only sought their own self-interest and disregarded the survival of the nation, he joined with like-minded people to organize the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group. In 1932, martyr Liu Chongwu threw a bomb at a foreign goods store on Kangnao Road as a warning to the traitorous merchants and was arrested by the Gedeng Road police station. Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, and others were arrested one after another and sent to the First Special District Court, where they were sentenced to twelve years and six or seven years of imprisonment, respectively. The Aid Patriotic Martyrs Committee of various circles in this city repeatedly appealed to the central government, but did not receive approval. Martyr Pan was overly frightened in prison, so he suffered from severe lung disease. With the help of the martyr's family and the Aid Patriotic Martyrs Committee, he was released on bail and sent to a doctor for treatment. Due to the deep wound, he died on November 3rd at 5:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang Case Trial Concluded</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for Next Saturday</p>
<p>The case of Liang Tongfang, leader of the Red Blood Anti-Traitor Group, throwing a bomb at the Yuelaixiang Restaurant, was continued yesterday morning by Feng Shiqi, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. First, Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the police station, stated that after the postponement last time, detectives from the police station went to the Heming Hotel again to investigate and found that there was a Hong En, a Cantonese, 24 years old, who opened room 68 at the hotel on the 18th of last month. Now, tea server Zhang Aqiu is here to testify. As for whether Liang had the intention to kill, it is clearly expressed in the leaflets that were seized. The leaflets stated that if anyone disobeyed or undermined their work, they would have to be destroyed with guns and bombs in order to maintain their prestige. Therefore, it can be seen that he had already planned to kill. Then, Zhang Aqiu testified that Hong En came to open room 68 at 8:00 p.m. on the 18th of last month. Later, four people came together, including the defendant Liang Tongfang. They all stayed in the room that day until 10:00 a.m. the next morning before checking out. As for what they talked about, he could not know because the door was closed. When questioned, Liang Tongfang stated that what was discussed at the Heming Hotel was a warning method. After deliberation, it was decided that it would affect the innocent, so it was decided to throw bombs as a warning when the shop assistants of each store were eating at noon, so there would definitely not be many customers, so it would never hurt anyone. The words in the leaflets were also of a warning nature and had no intention of killing. If he wanted to kill, why go at noon and notify the shop assistants of each store to leave, and I would not have been injured. The rest of his testimony has been detailed in the previous two reports of this newspaper. At this point, the witness has been examined. Judge Feng then ordered the debate to begin. Wang, the police lawyer, based on the circumstances at the time and various evidence, believed that Liang's actions were premeditated and requested that he be punished in accordance with Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Then, Liang's defense lawyers, Ge Zhaoji and Ma Junyi, defended, saying that Liang was acting out of patriotic sentiments and was giving a warning to the traitorous merchants. Based on the circumstances at the time and the testimony of all parties, there was no intention to kill, and the explosion of the bomb was accidental and was a loss of control. Moreover, Liang is now disabled and suffers from illness, which is very pitiful. He should be declared innocent. If the court believes that he should be punished according to law, he should also be given a lighter sentence and probation. During the probation period, he should still be sent to the hospital. Judge Feng then declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing for next Saturday morning, and ordered that Liang be sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment before the sentencing date.</p>
<p>Overturned Oil</p>
<p>Fire Burns More Than Thirty Rooms</p>
<p>Residents of Hubei Road Have Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>Shameless Man and Woman Flee Without a Trace</p>
<p>The area along Quanling Road in Zhabei is a residence for poor people, so there are more than a hundred thatched huts. Among them, there is a man named Wang Er from Yancheng, who makes a living by pushing carts. His wife, Wang Zhu, is about thirty years old and very licentious. Wang Er is driven by food and clothing, so he works hard outside all day. Even when he returns home at night, he is so tired from running around all day that he falls asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow. But Wang Zhu is not willing to be lonely and has an affair with someone. Every time Wang Er goes out, she calls her lover for a tryst. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 p.m., Wang Zhu called her lover to her home for a tryst again. However, the thatched hut was unusually dark, so Wang Zhu lit an oil lamp and placed it on the table. Unexpectedly, when the two were flirting and joking, they accidentally knocked over the oil lamp, and the oil splashed everywhere, immediately causing a fire. In addition, the weather was dry and the fire spread quickly. In an instant, the fire spread throughout the house. Wang Zhu and her lover saw that they could not put out the fire, so they rushed out of the door. At the same time, the fire also spread to the surrounding houses. A group of poor people carried their old and young and fled in a hurry, shouting and crying, and the order was immediately thrown into chaos. Before long, the fire became more and more extensive. Fortunately, the police on duty received the alarm and immediately notified the fire department to send fire trucks to put out the fire. At the same time, the head of the Hengfeng Road Branch in the Xinzha District dispatched patrol officers to lead the police to maintain order, which was only slightly stabilized. At the same time, the firefighters also bravely rescued the fire, so the fire was prevented from continuing to spread. After about an hour, it was completely extinguished. In total, about thirty thatched huts were destroyed. A group of victims had nowhere to go and had to sleep in the wilderness, suffering from hunger and cold. The situation was very miserable. As for Wang Zhu, who caused the disaster, the detectives were ordered to search everywhere and must arrest her and investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Lu Shigun</p>
<p>Kidnapping Rural Women to Sell Children</p>
<p>Under the Guise of Introducing Them to Work in Shanghai</p>
<p>He Violated the Women and Planned to Sell Two Children</p>
<p>Yuan Bangxiang, a villager from Sanyang Town, Haimen, Jiangsu, is 42 years old this year. His wife, Fang, is 32 years old this year. He has two daughters, the eldest named Fengcheng, 7 years old this year, and the second named Fengdi, 3 years old. The two children are smart and lively and are loved by Yuan and his wife. Yuan and his wife have been farming in the countryside for a living and live with their elderly parents. Recently, due to the bankruptcy of the countryside, it is not easy for Yuan's family of six to make a living, and they are in a rather difficult situation. Lu Shigun, a fellow villager, 22 years old this year, who has been working in Shanghai, recently returned to his hometown. Seeing that Yuan's two daughters were cute, he had evil thoughts. So he told Yuan's parents a lot of lies, saying that various factories in Shanghai are now recruiting female workers with high wages. If you are so poor in the countryside, it is better to let your daughter-in-law (referring to Bangxiang's wife, Fang) bring the children to Shanghai with me to find work in a yarn factory. The wages earned each month can subsidize the family. Yuan's parents listened to Lu's flowery words and believed them to be true. They discussed it with their son Bangxiang and immediately ordered his daughter-in-law Yuan Fang to take the two children and follow Lu Shigun to Shanghai to wait for Lu's recommendation for work. The whole family was delighted. Lu then came to Shanghai with Fang and her two daughters a few days ago and stayed at room 10 of the Ningshao Hotel at 12 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. He first had sexual relations with her for several nights, thinking that the first step of the kidnapping had been achieved, and the goal had been reached. Then he used his means to sell the children. He told her that in order to work in the factory, it is better to first find a way to temporarily foster the older girl with a friend so</p>

<p>Fierce Competition</p>
<p>The competition for the championships in both men's and women's groups is quite fierce, especially between Huadong and Wuben. Huadong was previously three points behind Wuben. Yesterday, in the 100-meter final, Huadong surpassed by two points. However, after the 200-meter final, Wuben won by four points again. Huadong's chance to win the championship entirely depended on the javelin throw. However, yesterday, Zhang Pingfu was greatly disappointed and gained nothing. Fortunately, Zhang Sumei put in great effort and won first place, resulting in a one-point victory over Wuben. If Zhang Sumei had only placed second, Wuben would have beaten Huadong by one point and won the Women's A Championship. Coincidentally, Gong Juping of Shanghai Girls' Middle School had a sore arm yesterday and could not exert force, only falling short of Zhang Sumei by three-ninths of a meter. If Gong Juping had won first place in the javelin, Huadong would have had to hand over the Women's A Championship to Wuben. It was a close call.</p>

<p>Finals Sketches</p>
<p>Chen Yongfu: A Promising Talent</p>
<p>In the Men's A 100-meter final, Ye Haitao of Private Shangzhong Middle School had a very fast start, reminiscent of Zeng Rongzhong. Chen Yongfu of Yuqing Middle School's final sprint was quite effective, similar to Dong Yinchu, and he is truly a promising talent.</p>
<p>Zhang Minru Takes the Field Despite Illness</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Minzhi of Patriotic School caught a cold the day before. She had already managed to endure the 50-meter final with great effort. Yesterday, she still took to the field despite her illness, participating in the 100-meter final, but ultimately fell behind Deng Guoxian of Wuben.</p>
<p>Tang Xianlin Moves Up Three Places</p>
<p>In the Men's B 800-meter final, Chen Yexing of Guanghua Middle School, who came in first, and Wang Yongqing of Qingxin Middle School, who came in second, were disqualified for violating rules and being overweight respectively, causing Tang Xianlin, who was originally in fifth place, to suddenly become second.</p>
<p>Two Famous Athletes Greatly Disappoint</p>
<p>Jin Zhongkang of Private Shangzhong Middle School in the 1500-meter race, everyone expected him to compete with Wang Zhenglin. Wang He's pole vault was also expected to be the champion without a doubt. However, the results were disappointing. Jin Zhongkang's name disappeared from the list, and Wang He only achieved fourth place.</p>

<p>Group Performance</p>
<p>Yesterday was the final day of the conference. The group performances were mostly by physical education schools. The Tai Chi exercise of the Chinese Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School, with its soft yet firm intentions, was greatly appreciated by the audience. The ball exercise and dance of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School, accompanied by the sound of the zither, had a good sense of pace and were lively and delightful. The apparatus exercise and pyramid formation of the Private Shangzhong Middle School were quick and powerful, showing the diligence of their daily practice. In addition, the basic exercise of the Chinese Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School, the martial arts practice steps of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School, the fitness exercise of the Shanghai North Middle School, the martial arts of the Guangdong Middle School, and the Black Horse Folk Dance of the Republic Women's Middle School were all commendable.</p>

<p>Behind-the-Scenes at the Event</p>
<p>The Commendable Spirit of Old Boy Scouts</p>
<p>The order at yesterday's event was still good, thanks to the Boy Scouts and the Security Corps. Feng Shutian, a student of the East Asia Boy Scout Training Class, who is already forty years old, also came to the venue to serve, doing his best to be dutiful. It is reported that when Mr. Liu was studying at Peking Republic University, he participated in the North China Games and won second place in the shot put, making him a veteran of the sports world.</p>
<p>Physical Education School Javelin Throwers Fight Through the Night</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the conference, and all track and field events had to be completed. The javelin throw for the women's track and field event by the Physical Education School did not finish until the night was dim. A gasoline lamp was temporarily lit for the night battle, which did not end until 6:30 PM, causing the recorders to complain endlessly.</p>
<p>Sports Strengthen the Body; Be Careful in Conduct</p>
<p>Athlete No. 405 of Datong Middle School Attached had a conflict with the venue staff due to weighing, almost resorting to violence. The student's attitude was tough, which was a great departure from the original purpose of sports. Young people are full of vigor, so be careful in conduct. It is important to be cautious.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife Follow Each Other; Attention is Focused</p>
<p>Shao Ying, the former ball player from Liangjiang, has not been seen for a long time. Yesterday, she suddenly arrived, with her hair permed, wearing leather shoes, a coat, and a cheongsam, looking every inch a young lady. She and her husband, the sports expert Liu Xuesong, jointly served as timers. The husband and wife followed each other closely, and the audience's attention could not help but focus on them.</p>
<p>Zilu Not Coming is a Great Disappointment</p>
<p>Chen Bingde, who is praised by Jiaotong University students as Confucius' disciple "Zilu," was not seen at the venue yesterday for inspection. Some say that Old Chen was afraid of settling old scores, which is a great disappointment.</p>
<p>Victory and Defeat Have Been Decided; Parade Celebrations</p>
<p>After the results of the finals were announced and victory and defeat had been decided, the students of Private Shangzhong and Huadong Girls' Middle School, who won the men's and women's A group championships respectively, cheered three hundred times. They then organized a parade to celebrate. For a time, the military music was loud and cheerful, and the firecrackers crackled, making for a very lively scene. The Southeast Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School even sang the victory song in the dim twilight, showing their elation.</p>
<p>Two Young Ladies Injured and Weeping</p>
<p>Zhang Sumei of Huadong was injured in her leg during the long jump the day before. Yesterday, while jumping 200 meters, the old injury recurred, leading to her defeat. The carefully bandaged Zhang burst into tears, covering her face with a handkerchief and unable to stop her grief. Also, Chen Shufang of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teacher Training School accidentally dislocated her foot while throwing the javelin. She fell to the ground and cried loudly. Due to the severity of the injury, she was sent to the nearby Red Cross for treatment.</p>

<p>Hard Court Tennis Men's Singles Championship Final</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Wins Over Carlson in Five Sets</p>
<p>Wang's Cross-Court Shots Are Ten Times Out of Nine, Unmatched</p>
<p>It's a Pity His Serve and Smash Are Lacking, Spoiling the Perfection</p>
<p>Men's Doubles Final Today at 2 PM</p>
<p>The result of yesterday's men's singles final of the 22nd Hard Court Tennis Championship, organized by the French Chamber of Commerce, was that Wang Wenzheng unexpectedly defeated Carlson, the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Singles Champion, in five sets, with scores of 6-0, 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, and 9-7. Wang Wenzheng's performance yesterday showed that he had done his best, played carefully, and was meticulous in every way, which is why he was able to achieve this unexpected result. The men's doubles final will be held tomorrow afternoon, with Carlson/De Fours vs. Qiu Feihai/Bennafe. The situation of yesterday's singles is as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng 丨(6-0 4-6 5-7 6-3 9-7)丨 Carlson</p>
<p>Overall Trend of Wins and Losses</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng has defeated Lin Baohua this year, then Qiu Feihai, and now Carlson. He can be said to be a formidable young man with unlimited hope. However, he still needs to work hard to improve his technique. His cross-court shots on both the left and right sides are almost perfect, and he has reached a state of perfect skill. However, his serve is too weak. Yesterday, there were many serves that did not clear the net or went out of bounds. His smashing skills also need to be trained as soon as possible. Yesterday, Wang, under extreme advantage, lacked these two skills, resulting in such a hard-fought situation. Otherwise, he should have won in straight sets. Carlson could not exert his smashing and net-playing talents, and his serve could not put Wang in a deadly position, which was the reason for his miserable defeat. Wang's shots were very low, often just clearing the net, which was also the reason for his victory. Hard-Fought Situation</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng opened the game with extremely accurate and powerful cross-court shots, attacking Carlson. Carlson also countered with cross-court shots. Then, game after game, Wang won. Carlson saw that the overall trend was going and let it go, resulting in 6-0. In the second set, Carlson began to go to the net, but the servers all won. Each scored two, then three. Wang lost the seventh game serve, and Carlson won back the second set with 6-4. In the third set, Wang took the lead with 4-2, but Carlson caught up to 4-4. Wang saved the ninth game but was ultimately won over by Carlson in two consecutive games. Carlson won the third set with 7-5. During the set, Wang found three excellent smash opportunities but sent them all into the net, causing the whole venue to sigh. From then on, Wang did not dare to easily smash. In the fourth set, Wang returned to his fierce forehand attack and won again with 6-3. In the final deciding set, Carlson served first, and the servers again each won, until 4-4. From then on, another strange situation occurred. The servers failed again, making it 6-6. After 7-7, Wang won two consecutive games and won the championship. Wang had two balls that hit the net in this set, but they all went over the net, which may have been good luck. The results of the mixed doubles final are as follows:</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3 id="e5">Opening Remarks by Zhang Shouyong <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of the China Economic Credit Cooperative has been a fleeting year. Confucius said, "It may be sufficient in a month; it may be achieved in three years." The commentators explained, "A month refers to a full year." Now that a full year has passed, to say it is already sufficient would be presumptuous of me. To say it will be achieved in three years, will three years be enough? I dare not predict.</p>
<p>However, considering the Chinese economy, how does it compare today to three years ago? And what will it be like in another three years? This is what we must contemplate. Shouyong, in deep thought, believes that with China's lagging production, coupled with the promotion of foreign goods, the adherence to outdated methods by farmers and laborers, and the shallow scholarship of scholars and merchants, everyone follows the usual and inherited practices, lacking a long-term vision and struggling to cope with the environment. If we continue on this path, without changing the customs, the whole country will be impoverished, and the nation will suffer accordingly. This is obvious without needing divination.</p>
<p>Today, everyone blames the government for this. I say that the government certainly bears its responsibility, but the government relies on society. If society is like a plate of loose sand, then the government will be even more incapable. The responsibility lies not above but below; this is evident. The way to save it lies in cooperation. Only when everyone has an interest in cooperation can there be cooperative enterprises. Cooperative enterprises are numerous, but economic cooperation is fundamental. Starting small and growing large, from one organization to countless organizations, only then will its effect be significant. The China Economic Credit Cooperative is a small organization. How can it benefit society? However, if this one organization promotes countless others, then it will be like the cement used to build a great building; I know it will surely be effective. Although it has only been a year, I dare not say it is already sufficient, but waiting for three to ten years, hearing the news and rising up, following in its footsteps, then its success will depend on the gentlemen of the nation.</p>
<p>The General Situation of the Cooperative in the Past Year</p>
<p>Qiu Hanping</p>
<p>The cooperative's affairs have developed rapidly in the past year. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Promoting Cooperation. In addition to publishing small booklets such as "General Outline of Business," "Economic Cooperation," and "A Glimpse of Our Cooperative," there was also the "Economic Cooperation Weekly," published as a supplement in the "Morning Post," which has reached its 23rd issue. The "Economic Cooperation Monthly," has reached its fourth issue and has been renamed "Cooperative News," published weekly, and has reached its fifth issue. In addition, there were three special publications in major newspapers for the opening ceremony and the expanded solicitation campaign for the Economic Cooperation Movement. The power of publicity has become even greater. The enthusiastic support of the newspapers is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>2.  Soliciting Cooperative Members. At the time of the opening last year, there were only 85 members. After July, there was a large increase. As of last month, the total number of members was 1,026. By occupation, shop owners accounted for 294, and the education sector accounted for 220, the largest numbers. However, due to the decline of the social economy, many members cannot subscribe to the full share (a full share is 1,000 yuan to be redeemed upon maturity or death). Currently, this income is about 2,000 yuan per month. As of October, a total of more than 11,800 yuan has been received.</p>
<p>3.  Revenue and Expenditure. The cooperative's monthly expenses are about 900 yuan. Rent, water, electricity, patrol room donations, telephone, etc., are about 400 yuan. There are nearly 20 employees. Only junior employees receive salaries. The main employees are willing to sacrifice for the cooperative cause and only receive a small allowance. Therefore, the total monthly expenses are less than 400 yuan. This expense, except for one-tenth of the members' savings and insurance fund, is borne by the basic shareholders' shares and their interest. In the future, as the number of members increases, there will be no need for basic shareholders to bear it.</p>
<p>4.  Undertaking Business. The major businesses undertaken this year include a hostel and the Huahai Vocational Middle School. The hostel provides accommodation for members at a very low cost. Unfortunately, the scale is too small. An appropriate location is being sought to expand it greatly. Huahai Middle School was founded by Director Zhang and others with donations to train cooperative talents. The school building has not yet been built and is temporarily located on Maitehe Road. Other businesses to be undertaken will be gradually implemented.</p>
<p>5.  Benefits for Members. In addition to the ordinary benefits of savings and insurance, the cooperative's members also have other benefits:</p>
<p>A. Benefits of Various Loans</p>
<p>The cooperative has already offered credit loans and bill discounts, with a total loan amount of 14,720 yuan. Currently being organized are two types of loans: fund certificate mortgages and unemployment loans. The members' savings are used for the members' loans. Savers are essentially insuring their own funds, and borrowers are essentially paying their own interest.</p>
<p>B. Benefits of Personnel Guidance</p>
<p>The cooperative has hired ten legal advisors, seven medical advisors, and six college guidance counselors to serve its members, all to be available for members' inquiries at any time. Moreover, not only are they available for inquiries, but this summer, members' children were guaranteed free tuition at Huahai Vocational Middle School.</p>
<p>C. Benefits of Low-Cost Consumption</p>
<p>It is difficult to distinguish the authenticity of goods displayed in stores, and prices vary. Daily consumption can easily lead to wasted money if one is not careful. To save on consumption for its members, the cooperative has special agreements with various companies. Members can be sure that the goods they purchase are genuine and at discounted prices. There are already 29 companies with special agreements, including bookstores such as Zhonghua and World, industries such as Family Industries and China Chemical Industries, pharmacies such as Chinese and Western Pharmacies, food such as Guanshengyuan, clothing such as Zhanghua Woolen Mill, underwear ABC, and photo studios such as Qichang, Xuehuai, and Metropolis. Negotiations are currently underway to ensure that all categories are available.</p>
<p>The Cooperative's Work Plan for the Coming Year</p>
<p>Qiu Hanping</p>
<p>At the beginning of its establishment, the cooperative announced to society that its purpose was to achieve economic cooperation. In the past year, we have been working hard every day. Unfortunately, at the initial stage, the scale was small, and some members still did not understand the nature of the cooperative. (I remember one member who came to the cooperative to request a loan. Because the cooperative's funds had already been loaned out, we could only introduce him to another place. This was the cooperative's helpless dilemma. Unexpectedly, the member said something very unpleasant, saying, "If you don't want to lend, then don't. Why say there's no quota?" This member fundamentally treated the cooperative as a customer treats a store, which is wrong.) However, it is not easy for an organization to make people understand and believe in it. In the past year, in order to make more people in society understand the cooperative, we held the Economic Cooperation Movement and the Expanded Solicitation Movement. After we held these movements, people in society began to recognize the cooperative, which gave our staff a boost.</p>
<p>Speaking of the work plan for the coming year, in addition to continuing the unfinished work of the past, we have formulated the following points:</p>
<p>1. Soliciting Cooperative Comrades</p>
<p>A. Small Businessmen: In Shanghai, apart from factories, banks, large companies, and firms, it can be said that 80 percent are small businessmen. These small businessmen make a great contribution to society and are also the second-level people who are exploited (the first level is consumers). Sometimes they need funds, but they have nowhere to turn. In our past 1,000 members, this type of small businessman has accounted for 20 percent, which shows that small businessmen need to join cooperatives.</p>
<p>B. Teachers: Teachers are the guides of society, and their responsibilities are heavy. However, in this economically bankrupt China, teachers' salaries are very pitiful. Not only is it difficult to live before death, but also they burden others after death. As for the education of their children after death, there is no need to mention it. For example, a famous professor at a university who recently passed away had to borrow money for medical expenses when he was sick, and after his death, he relied on friends to take care of his funeral. This is such a pitiful thing. We believe that today's teachers in China most need to join cooperatives. However, they are like a plate of loose sand and do not have time to manage. Since ancient times, poor scholars in China have not been engaged in production. Only by joining a cooperative can they obtain a guarantee of life. Before death, there is a mutual aid organization, and after death, there is no need to worry about the life of the family. It is beneficial to both society and the individual. However, people in the education sector often do not consider this far, and even think that even if they have a thousand yuan of savings in the future, it may not be of any help. But when they are in trouble, they realize the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>C. Laborers and Shop Assistants: Because most Chinese people have not received education, their knowledge is low, and the effectiveness of written propaganda is simply equal to zero for them. Moreover, in this evil society, it is extremely difficult for them to save up. The organizations they usually join are either gambling dens or secret societies. We want to rely on cooperative workers who understand cooperation to impart cooperative knowledge to them. At the same time, we will cooperate with factories to promote the common interests of labor and capital.</p>
<p>As for shop assistants, the situation is also very pitiful. Most of the shop assistants in old-style Chinese stores are apprentices, with a maximum of three or five yuan per month for pocket money, which is not enough. Of course, there is no talk of savings. We treat everyone equally and now want to formulate a plan so that shop assistants can also enjoy the benefits of cooperation.</p>
<p>2. Promoting Cooperation</p>
<p>In the past, our propaganda methods were through various daily newspapers and cooperative publications. We have not yet printed complete booklets. In the coming year, we plan to focus on practical aspects of cooperation propaganda. Mr. Sun Yat-sen promoted the revolution with the theory of easy action and difficult knowledge. We also firmly believe that only by practicing can we complete the cooperative cause. We plan to study various practical problems and methods, compare their advantages and disadvantages, and publish single booklets. The existing publications will continue to be enriched, and the cooperative news will be changed to a shorter publication, imitating the style of American cooperative news.</p>
<p>3. Editing Accounting and Bookkeeping Books for Cooperatives</p>
<p>To make Chinese cooperatives uniform, accounting books are most important. We plan to compile accounting books based on the Cooperative Law and the nature of various cooperatives for cooperatives to purchase. This will not only achieve uniformity but also save cooperatives expenses.</p>
<p>4. Expanding the Hostel</p>
<p>At the beginning of the cooperative's establishment, the hostel was small and insufficient for use, and it was inconvenient to be located in the cooperative. We are now trying to separate it and expand it to meet the needs of members.</p>
<p>5. Establishing Offices</p>
<p>In the past year, in response to requests from people in various places, the cooperative has set up an office in Xiamen and agencies in Surabaya and Minli in the Dutch East Indies. In the coming year, we plan to set up offices in Nanjing, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou to seek contact and promote the cooperative.</p>
<p>6. Soliciting Basic Shareholders</p>
<p>The basic shareholders of the cooperative bear double the responsibility, and the initial capital is 50,000 yuan. We plan to increase the number of basic shareholders in the coming year, hoping to reach 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>7. Convening a Cooperative Conference</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the failure of past cooperatives was mostly due to the lack of contact, so that they could not help each other in times of trouble, the cooperative plans to convene a full conference in the coming year to discuss the implementation plan, in order to gather ideas and benefit from them.</p>
<p>In short, the cooperative's members will work together with the spirit of sacrifice to implement economic cooperation and mutual assistance. We hope that people from all walks of life will give us more guidance and provide us with convenience everywhere, so that the cooperative cause will flourish and we can jointly realize the ideal society.</p>

<p>Qianjiang Railway Bridge to Break Ground Today</p>
<p>Grand Ceremony Held in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life in the City Attend</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Railway Bridge, built by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, is scheduled to begin construction today and will be completed in one and a half years. A grand groundbreaking ceremony will be held in Hangzhou today. Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming was specially sent by the Ministry of Railways to attend as a representative. Representatives from the local press and all walks of life also took a bus to Hangzhou yesterday afternoon to participate. The general situation of the bridge project is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Qianjiang Bridge is built near the Zhakou Railway Station. The entire bridge is 3,840 feet long and 55 feet above the water surface. There are 15 bridge piers, each spanned by steel frames. The bridge body is divided into upper and lower layers. The lower layer is for the railway track, the upper layer is for the roadway, and there is a sidewalk. The road surface is 30 feet wide, allowing cars to travel without obstruction. The construction of the bridge was proposed more than ten years ago. Responsible officials in Zhejiang Province repeatedly met to discuss its construction, but it was suspended due to the huge project and lack of economic resources. Almost last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government believed that the bridge runs through the north and south of the province and occupies an important position in administration, commerce, and military affairs, and it was urgent and could not be delayed. It then actively proceeded, first establishing the Qianjiang Bridge Engineering Office to be responsible for the implementation, with Mao Yisheng as the director and Luo Ying as the chief engineer. It then recruited domestic and foreign engineering experts to study and discuss before deciding on the plan. In March of this year, merchants were invited to bid, and last month it was decided that the total project value was more than 4.3 million yuan. The funding was shared equally by the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, divided into three parts, which were contracted by various merchants. The 15 bridge piers were contracted by the local Kangyi Foreign Company for 1.6 million yuan. The two approach bridges at both ends were contracted by the local Dongya Construction Company, valued at 900,000 yuan. The steel frames of the bridge body were built by the British Daomen Steel Factory, valued at 1.8 million yuan. It is reported that the groundbreaking ceremony will be held today, and it is scheduled to be officially opened to traffic on January 1, 1937.</p>

<p>At 2 pm yesterday, the original British flag was removed and replaced with the Blue Sky White Sun flag, the naval flag, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company flag. When receiving, only high-rise firecrackers were set off, and there were no other ceremonies. The guests then flocked to the large dining room on the second floor to congratulate Liu Hongsheng, who warmly greeted them separately with the staff, offering tea and snacks, and accompanying the guests to visit various departments until 5 pm when the ceremony ended. Today, the upper and lower guests are invited to the ship to visit.</p>
<p>Anti-Theft Equipment</p>
<p>The reporter was guided by engineer Zhang and Mr. Wang Jixian to visit each department. The construction of the ship is not only the most modern in Shanghai, but also the first in England. The entire ship's cabin is divided into three decks. The upper deck is the shipowner's room, the first and second mate's rooms, and the bridge is on the upper end. The radio room is behind the bridge. The second floor is the special room and the large dining room. The third floor is the officer's cabin and the second-class room. The first floor is the residence of the ship's drivers, and the cabin position on the second floor can be completely cut off after the wheel is opened. Between the large dining room and the bridge, there are anti-theft iron bars around the perimeter, and even the top surface of the machine room is also added with iron grids. Even if bandits mixed in, they would have no way to reach the bridge, and they would be bound in vain. The precision of the arrangement and the thoughtfulness of the design are still the first to be seen in our country's ships.</p>
<p>Unique Machinery</p>
<p>In addition to the wheeling parts on the swearing-in platform, a (1) fire extinguisher is specially added. This machine reaches all the cabins of the ship, and the parts are clearly marked with the various cabins. For example, if a fire breaks out in cabin No. 1, the No. 1 cabin mark in the machine will detect a current warning, which can be immediately put out. (2) The direction finder is an electric I</p>

<p>Overview of the Conference</p>
<p>In this conference, many of the track and field results of both men and women broke records, which shows the diligence of daily hard work. However, compared with the records created by Japanese middle school students, the difference is still far away. To achieve substantial progress, it is still necessary for you to work hard. In terms of group exercises, the performances observed in the past three days were neat and skilled, and there has been significant progress, which is quite commendable. The performance of Chengzhong Middle School was particularly beautiful, which was most appreciated by the audience. The good order of the venue and the diligence of the staff are especially commendable. The moral cultivation of the athletes is also much better than in the past. It is commendable that there are one or two people who are eager to win and cannot absolutely obey the measures of the conference staff, which is not without regret. In the future, I hope that the gentlemen who participate in the sports movement will take the purpose of the movement to strengthen our nation as the original intention and not take victory or defeat as humiliation.</p>

<h3 id="e13">The Spirit of the Boy Scouts <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Dear children! Do you know what the spirit of the Boy Scouts is? Their spirit is very great. So, what is so great about it? Now I will roughly tell you a paragraph to listen to.</p>
<p>They are small organized armies. Life is very simple. They can live anywhere, and everyone has a spirit of self-government. No matter how difficult a thing is, they always have a spirit of perseverance and will not give up until they succeed! They also have a spirit of love. If they encounter a child crying on the road, they will immediately help him up or send him home. If someone asks for directions, they will sincerely guide him or lead him to his destination. They have a spirit of sacrifice. No matter how dangerous or precarious a thing is, they will rush forward and put their lives at risk to save him from danger. The spirit of service is also common. When we are at sports meets or other gatherings, they conscientiously maintain order in the venue and fulfill their responsibilities. Think about it: the spirit of the Boy Scouts! How great it is!</p>
<p>Children! Although you are young, your ambitions are very high. Quickly cultivate the great spirit that Boy Scouts should have. We hope that you will all join the Boy Scouts and carry forward the spirit of the Boy Scouts to break world records. Then, you will definitely be able to save our dying China!</p>
<h3 id="e14">Children of the World <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Yuyang</p>
<p>(1) The children of Myanmar are truly pitiable; they can no longer receive their own education. Since their country was lost to England, they are no longer allowed to establish Burmese schools. From then on, the children of Myanmar can only receive a British education.</p>
<p>(2) The children of Annam (Vietnam) have also lost their country. They are even more pitiable, often sitting in small boats like pieces of wood, begging for money. Whenever large steamships are docked in the harbor, they row up to the ships and beg for money from the passengers. Think of how much suffering that is!</p>
<p>(3) The Sahara is a large desert in North Africa. There is very little rain there throughout the year. They often move their tents in search of places with water and grass to live. Their clothing is somewhat like the children in our Mongolian region, with white long gowns and Chinese-style red leather shoes. Their attire is very special.</p>
<p>(4) The Yao people are also a unique ethnic group in southwestern China. They are very short in stature, and their way of life is similar to that of primitive peoples. However, they love to eat salt. The children there eat salt as happily as the children here eat candy.</p>

<p>Silver Prices Rise, Gold Prices Increase</p>
<p>Speculative Margin Drops Two Yuan and Three Jiao</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Closed on Monday for Premier's Birthday</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday presented a fluctuating picture. Although the Central Bank continued to release US dollars, the domestic market hardened, but Chinese merchants found it difficult to close deals. Therefore, although it fell, it was still able to be pulled up. Market sentiment seemed brisk, and there were some gains in the middle, with occasional rebounds. However, in the end, it continued to fall due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. It was observed that the overseas silver market rose uniformly in both England and America in the early morning. Although foreign exchange rates narrowed, it was not by much. London raw gold rose by five and a half pence. Market sentiment was stable. Outside the market, preparatory trading was done at 78 yuan, and it immediately rose to over 80 yuan. The Central Bank's listed exchange rate revealed that the English rate was flat, while the American rate decreased by 0.0625. The customs gold unit increased by six li. The standard price for speculative margins rose to 990 yuan and three jiao. However, large investors took advantage of the high prices to sell aggressively. Although the opening was high in the morning, it immediately went downstream after opening. The Central Bank cut prices and sold cheaply, and the foreign exchange market suddenly loosened, causing another round of declines. Although there were those who bought at the lows, it was only a slight fluctuation. The HSBC listed exchange rate revealed that the English rate rose by 0.25 and the American rate rose by 0.4375. The Central Bank continued to release currency. Although the banks absorbed it, the American dollar had already loosened to over 34 yuan. The situation was most tired at this time, but the underlying potential was quite good, and they rushed to replenish at the lows. The situation gradually stabilized again. Chinese merchants closed deals at the cheap prices, and the domestic market also tightened. The general psychological prediction was that the equalization tax would definitely not be reduced, because based on the silver market, it would be extended, causing the gold price to rebound after falling. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, there were many fluctuations. Until after 10 o'clock, the white silver equalization tax was announced, still levied at 7%, the same as the previous day, calculated based on an English exchange rate of one shilling and five pence. It once fell back, but large investors took the opportunity to cover their short positions, and it was still able to be pulled up. Market sentiment also gradually improved, and rebounds were seen afterwards. There was a lack of supply, and the buying trend became even more intense, even breaking through the 80 yuan mark. Large investors then began to unload. The Central Bank and the banks were still doing US dollar exchanges, which loosened and gradually went downstream. After this, the Guangdong trading houses slightly replenished their positions, and buyers continued to be active, rising after falling. The market situation has become mediocre. Even if there was a source of supply, due to the half-day closure on Saturday, plus the Monday holiday, short positions were being settled, and the gold market ended in a state of fluctuation. The rise and fall were unstable during the half-day. Both supply and demand sides were willing to work hard. Next Monday, the gold exchange will be closed for one day due to the Premier's birthday, and the Central Bank will be the standard for changes.

General market sentiment was quite good. Sheng Da, Qian Chang, Xiang Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Da Fa, Yong Yuan Chang, Yong Tong Fu, etc., all bought, gradually returning to 8 yuan. Yi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao Yong, etc., advanced after exiting. Hong Li was on the buying side, and Fu Xing Yong was on the selling side.

Fu Xing, Yong Fu Yu, etc., sold slightly, and many small investors unloaded, retreating to 4 yuan and a half. Unexpectedly, large investors turned bullish and covered their short positions at low prices. Within the market, Yuan Mao Yong, Da Fa Yong, Fu Xing Yong Heng Yu, etc., all advanced, rising again to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. Hong Kang Yong Rui Xing unloaded, dropping to 5 yuan and a half. Yuan Mao Yong Heng Xing Ren Fa Yong Tian Feng Yong, etc., advanced again, suffering from a lack of supply, picking up to 80 yuan.

As a result, it fell another 2 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>After the closing price, the Central Bank's speculative gold standard price rose to 990 yuan and 3 jiao. According to the closing price, it was approximately 13 yuan higher, which was more than 5 yuan stronger than the previous close. The old standard for November, based on the HSBC American exchange rate listing, increased by 4.75 yuan, calculated at 33.3125 yuan, equivalent to a speculative gold price of 1038 yuan with zero. The entry for this month was 977 yuan, December was 977 yuan, and the morning makeup water was 977 yuan. The red gold price was calculated at 988 yuan and 5 jiao. The spot market situation was sluggish. Even though the spot trading houses were watching from the sidelines, the customer trading houses, due to the cheap price, lacked a large appetite. Only the Tianjin trading houses sold 350 taels to Ying Feng Heng, with an additional 10 yuan. Due to the holiday and the Premier's birthday, this month's public orders were postponed until next week before they could be collected, but the amount was minimal.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Government Bonds' Rising Trend Resumed</p>
<p>96 Increased by the Most at Six Jiao and a Half</p>
<p>However, Many多头 From Northern Trading Houses Emerged</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to good news about the current situation and sincere negotiations between all parties, solidarity became increasingly strong, and market sentiment was therefore strong. 96, because多头 were still unwilling to emerge, 加码 increased. This type of undervalued government bond is easiest to manipulate, so its ups and downs are also unbelievable. However, its buying and selling are 90% speculative, so its danger is greater than any other bond. Looking at yesterday's market, the trading houses in the morning opening were very strong, and number 4 and number 50 continued to absorb, but number 11, the Northern Trading House, sold quite a bit, continuing from early morning to dusk. Especially 96 emerged the most. Market prices continued to rise by 1 to 4 jiao. The second half of the day was slightly chaotic, with ups and downs of 1 to 2 jiao. When the afternoon market opened, the individual investors' trading appetite surged again, and market prices continued to rise by 1 to 2 jiao. Due to the closure of the market on the anniversary of the Premier's birthday, it was delayed by two hours, and trading did not begin until after 6 pm. 96 continued to rise by 2 jiao. The trading houses' appetite was extremely strong, but number 11, the Northern Trading House, sold extremely vigorously. Market prices were high and then low, and the future trend was unpredictable and should not be overly optimistic. The market price finally continued to rise by 1 to 2 jiao to 5 to 6 jiao, with 96 increasing by the most at 6 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was approximately 20 million yuan. The results of its ups and downs are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>The US Stock Market Suddenly Prospered</p>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (9th), the New York stock market advanced under the leadership of automotive equipment, automotive, and construction stocks. The news about these industries was beneficial to多头, and at the same time, the atmosphere was generally optimistic. Some stocks created this year's high records. It was reported that a special agent was buying General Motors stock, and it was also reported that Sears Department Store would increase tire prices according to the recent price increases of manufacturers. This matter would make the price increases more effective, and rubber stocks also rose. The transactions in the last half hour had a feeling of recalling the prosperity era of the past. The bond market was mixed. Small exchange stocks also reached this year's new peak. Chicago wheat rose because domestic and foreign wheat production reports were beneficial to多头. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 1.23 million shares.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Gradually Expanding</p>
<p>Looking at the High 空气 Enveloping the Yarn Market</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, and the situation is becoming increasingly tight because customer trading houses' spot yarn needs are coming one after another. At the same time, American cotton is also rebounding, causing buyers' intentions to become stronger. And some speculators are diligently collecting spot yarn in the market. The reason for this is that they expect the Sichuan trading houses to launch procurement actions. Therefore, their intentions to look high have reached the extreme.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rises by One Yuan and Two Jiao</p>
<p>The opening of the speculative yarn market was due to the rebound of American cotton and the good sales of spot yarn the previous day, causing sellers to lack inventory and the market situation to be quite tight. All months rose by 8 jiao to 1 yuan and 2.4.5 jiao. The afternoon market opening was still firm, and spot yarn transactions were heard to be 2,000 bales. However, because多头 liquidated at the closing, all months fell by 1.2.3 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,300 bales. It was found that Hengda sold 400 bales, Jifeng 750 bales, Suilong 600 bales, Taixing 400 bales, Gengfeng 1,850 bales, Ruida 500 bales, Shenji 1,150 bales, Hengde 400 bales, Renfeng 750 bales, Yicheng 800 bales, Dachang 600 bales, Yongchang 450 bales, Daji 400 bales, Mingde 450 bales, and Tonghe 700 bales. Dafu bought 550 bales, Yunji 600 bales, Dafeng 1,600 bales, Mingde 750 bales, Zhenda 450 bales, Yuan Yi 1,700 bales, Changfeng 1,900 bales, and Run Kang 3,050 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Speculative Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise/Fall Number of Accounts</p>
<p>November 181.9 181.5 181.7 Up 0.90 31.650</p>

<p>Total 273.400</p>
<p>Actual Sales Increased to 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still smooth. It was found that all trading houses bought a total of 2,000 bales throughout the day. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each trading house is as follows:</p>
<p>同行 765 Shantou 40 Luzhou 75</p>
<p>内地 485 Guangdong 4 0 Tianjin 15</p>
<p>Fujian 14 Changsha 20 Jiangsu 200</p>
<p>Arrivals Are Not Late</p>
<p>Cotton Rebounds by Three to Four Jiao</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm because American cotton is rebounding and the yarn market is returning to high prices, causing market sentiment to be particularly strong. The Ningbo trading houses are discussing advancing and compensating. However, the gold market is trending down and foreign exchange rates are extending, so the large investors' short positions remain unchanged. Only spot cotton is firmer because arrivals are not strong, but speculative cotton transactions are very few.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Yong Compensation For Short Positions</p>
<p>The speculative cotton market opened higher, following American cotton. Sellers were scarce in the market, and the market atmosphere was tight. Each month rose by 1.2.3. jiao and a half. In the afternoon, the Ningbo trading houses compensated for their short positions very keenly, and the market was particularly dry. However, trading was not strong. Yuan Da continued to sell off, and as a result, each month rose by another 0.05 to 0.12 jiao. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 55,200担. It was found that Dafeng sold 2,100担, Hengyi 2,100担, Yuan Da 3,400担, Ruichang 1,000担, Tong Yu 1,600担, Taichang 1,500担, Changhe 1,300担, Daji 2,400担, Shenji 1,000担, Guangjin Hengyi 1,800担, Changfeng 3,000担, Run 4,800担, Yuan Yi 900担, Shenchang 2,100担, and Yifeng 1,900担.

<h3 id="e15">Young Drummer <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Chengzhao</p>
<p>During the Anglo-French war, there was a drummer in the British army, around fifteen or sixteen years old. One day, he happened to be out for a walk and was suddenly captured by French soldiers, who took him to the commander. The commander said to him:</p>
<p>"Hey, young friend, what do you do?"</p>
<p>"Sir, I am a drummer," he replied calmly.</p>
<p>The commander then ordered someone to bring a drum and told him to strike it. This young boy placed the drum properly, picked up a pair of mallets, and began to play a stirring march. The magnificent and passionate melody was touching to hear.</p>
<p>After he finished the march, the commander then told him to play a retreat. He immediately threw down the mallets without hesitation and angrily said to the commander:</p>
<p>"Sir, I don't know this. We British have never loved being taught to flee in the face of battle!"</p>
<p>The commander immediately walked over and shook his hand, then ordered his guards to send him back. He also personally wrote a letter to his commander, praising his courage.</p>
<p>Children, see how calm and brave this young drummer is!</p>
<h3 id="e16">Respectable Japanese People! <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Zuyin</p>
<p>Children: When you see this title, you must be somewhat dissatisfied. You think that the Japanese are so barbaric, sinister, and cunning... you can't hate them enough, so what is there to respect? But wait, please read on.</p>
<p>The other day, the Shenbao newspaper carried the following news from the Den-tsu News Agency:</p>
<p>"The completion ceremony of the Atsugi Aerodrome in Kanagawa Prefecture, and the inaugural flight ceremony of the 'Boy Volunteers' aircraft, were held at 10:00 AM today. The ceremony was grand. The funds for the aerodrome and the aircraft were collected by the Japan Volunteer Association from elementary school children nationwide by accumulating tinfoil from cigarette packages to create a fund, with the intention of cultivating young aviators and popularizing the idea of aviation among the public..."</p>
<p>The Japanese national character is inherently rich in the true spirit of hard work, doggedness, and practicality. During the Russo-Japanese War, they donated money saved by elementary school students nationwide from buying sweets to build a warship to encourage the morale of the troops at the front. Later, they achieved the final victory. Now, they are using the small piece of tinfoil inside a cigarette package to carry out widespread propaganda, awakening the masses to prepare for the (imminent) world war. Their deep thought, ingenious planning, and fervent patriotism are evident. From these points, they are not only respectable but also the most worthy of our emulation.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Ginkgo Tree <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>This tree has a very special name because it grows very slowly. That is to say, the tree planted by the grandfather (i.e., grandparent) will not bear fruit until the grandson's time. As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow a tree," but the ginkgo tree is an exception. Generally, the slower plants and animals grow, the longer they live. Since the ginkgo tree grows so slowly, even centuries-old ginkgo trees still have green branches and leaves and do not wither. This tree can reach a height of ten zhang. It is a deciduous tree with leaves that look like fans and have notches. It blooms with small flowers in the spring, which are white with a light green tint. It bears many fruits in the autumn. The flesh of the fruit is inedible. After the frost, the flesh rots, and the kernel is taken as the fruit. The outside has a white shell, so it is called "white fruit." The white fruit is also known as ginkgo. It goes on the market in July and August. Street vendors put the stir-fried ginkgo in cloth bags and use spatulas to stir and mix broken ceramic pieces in the pot, making a "ding-dong, ding-dong" sound, while loudly shouting poetic-like high-pitched calls. They sell them everywhere in the streets and alleys. Children under the age of twelve who eat too much of it are often poisoned by the ginkgo and develop a severe illness. The symptoms of this illness are foaming at the mouth and convulsive muscles, like seizures. If the parents do not know it is ginkgo poisoning and ask the doctor to treat it as a seizure, the medicine will be ineffective and can be life-threatening. So children should be careful to eat less. When eating, the heart in the middle should be peeled open and removed. Also, for ginkgo poisoning, boil salty fish head bones in soup and drink it, and the poison will be vomited out immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Self-Study <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Du Juan</p>
<p>Often, many children, after finishing their homework, throw away their textbooks and busily engage in meaningless pastimes. As a result, they cannot perform well in exams and develop a lasting aversion to their studies. Consequently, they cannot succeed in school and will have no contribution to society in the future. It is truly difficult to produce talent in such a haphazard way!</p>
<p>To remedy this shortcoming, there is only one solution: "self-study." Every child should not only listen attentively in class but also study attentively at home. For example, if I have four or five hours of self-study time each day, I should review the lessons that the teacher taught in class. If the homework is done well, I will feel interested. The more interested I feel, the more I should do my homework. Then you can choose the subject you are most interested in and work hard at it. You should set aside a few hours of self-study each day, only allowing for an increase and not a decrease. If you don't have much free time, one or two hours of self-study each day is also good, as long as you can concentrate. Over time, you will surely succeed. However, the most important thing is that self-study requires "perseverance."</p>
<p>Children probably all know that Edison was a self-taught scientist who succeeded. We can be sure that any subject can be self-studied and that success can be achieved through self-study. If children can self-study their subjects and conduct research-oriented exploration, China may well have someone like Edison!</p>
<h3 id="e21">Water <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Jie</p>
<p>Water is generally said to be a kind of fluid. But, in various different situations, it can turn into various forms. It is like the shapeshifting monsters we see in stories.</p>
<p>We know that boiling water turns into gas. But what we usually see coming out of boiling water is not true gas, but just tiny droplets of water, because water vapor condenses when it encounters cold air. The clouds in the sky are just like the gas we see coming out of boiling water, large clumps of small water droplets formed when they encounter cold air. Clouds are formed when water on the ground evaporates and turns into gas, and when it encounters cold air, it condenses into many small water droplets. Near the ground, it is fog, and higher up, it is clouds. Clouds float in the sky and encounter even colder air, forming larger water droplets. These water droplets are heavier than air, so they fall down, and this is rain. Rain originally falls in drops, but because it is a continuous motion, when it is reflected into our eyes, rain seems to fall in long streaks to the ground. This reason is exactly the same as for motion pictures. Water vapor that encounters cold objects on the ground becomes frost, and if it encounters extremely cold air in the sky, it forms beautiful snowflakes that float down. But below zero degrees Celsius, water will freeze into solid ice.</p>
<p>Water is truly a substance that is good at changing its form.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Children's Science Lecture (1) <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder, and children all know that when they are cold, they should add more clothes. In cold weather, people usually wear cotton clothes. But how are cotton clothes made? Do children know? There are many kinds of cotton clothes. Most people wear cotton-padded jackets with cotton batting inside. The outer layer and lining of the jacket are sometimes made of silk, sometimes of wool, and sometimes of cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth is woven from cotton. Cotton is a herbaceous plant that bears fruit in August and September. When the fruit matures, the skin splits open, and the colored fibers inside are the raw material for weaving cotton cloth and padding cotton. (Figure 1)</p>
<p>Another raw material for making clothes is silk, which is spun by silkworms (Figure 2). Raising silkworms is a sideline for farmers in rural areas. Silkworms are soft-bodied reptiles like green worms, gray-white in color, and like to eat mulberry leaves. After four molts, they go to the cocoon bed and spin silk, binding themselves into cocoons. When they become cocoons, they are boiled in boiling water or baked in fire to kill the pupae inside. The cocoons are reeled into silk threads, which are the raw material for weaving silk fabrics. Silk is expensive, so silk fabrics are also expensive. Therefore, they are not commonly worn by ordinary people.</p>
<p>As for the raw material for weaving wool fabrics, it is wool (Figure 3). The camel wool commonly used for the lining of cotton coats is woven from the wool of camels (Figure 4). These are all able to keep out the cold and are soft and comfortable to wear, able to resist the invasion of cold air from the outside and maintain the original warmth of the body. They are superior raw materials for winter clothing, but unfortunately, they are very expensive and cannot be prepared by people of the middle and lower classes.</p>
<p>Among the materials for winter clothing to keep out the cold, there is also animal fur. The warmest of animal furs is fox fur (Figure 5). There are also many other kinds, such as wolf fur, leopard fur, sheep fur, cat fur, and rat fur, but none are as warm as fox fur. However, it is even more expensive than wool fabrics and is not affordable for the economic strength of ordinary people.</p>
<p>The most common raw material for summer clothing is summer cloth, which is woven from linen (Figure 6). It is loose and thin, and it is very cool to wear clothes made from it.</p>

<p>— (Gong Wang)</p>
<p>Deep water places are often dim, so observing things underwater often encounters obstacles, making it difficult to achieve the goal. Now I have a convenient method:</p>
<p>This little gadget is named the underwater periscope: First, use an ordinary glass bottle, put a regular flashlight inside the bottle (when putting it in, the lamp head must be facing up, turn on the light), then put on the bottle cap, and apply a layer of wax paint on the bottle mouth to prevent water from easily entering. After applying it well, wait for it to dry slowly, and tie a rope around the neck of the bottle. When playing, gradually lower the bottle into the water, and then everything in the water will be clear at a glance.</p>

<p>— Sheng Zhanfu</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Memorial Week again. Like a wheel, it spins and drives away the time week after week. But it runs so fast that we have to desperately chase after it and seize it!</p>
<p>The way to seize it: only by "planning" and "doing" from the start. Planning is the progress of life. Living a planned life is considered progressive education. Children who have been baptized by "life education": They have a plan for the day, a plan for the month, and a plan for the year. Especially doing Memorial Week is the day that the weekly plan comes to fruition. As the saying goes, "The plan for the day lies in the morning." You must know that "The plan for the week lies in Memorial Week." How serious a day is Memorial Week! You must strive to make a good weekly plan, without allowing any sloppiness. When you hold your life week meeting, strictly examine whether the work is completed? Is the result perfect? Only in this way can you avoid failing to live up to doing Memorial Week!</p>
<p>Children: Don't you believe in great figures the most, isn't it Mr. Sun Yat-sen? His revolutionary cause was also achieved through "planning," "perseverance," and "working hard." Since you admire his character, you should imitate him even more. This is the true way to commemorate him!</p>

<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Children: The reason why humans are stronger than all other animals is firstly because of their intelligence, and secondly because of their weapons. Generally speaking, intelligence and weapons are the tools of human protection. As for the protection tools of animals? The most obvious are the claws and teeth of tigers, and the scales and shells of turtles and fish. Besides these protection tools, there is also a kind of camouflage, such as the ink of squid, the discharge of electric fish, the cicada's color resembling tree bark, and the frog's color resembling mud. Besides this kind of camouflage, there is also a kind of special protection organ, such as the skunk's stench and the porcupine's quills, which are all enough to make the enemy not dare to pursue them!</p>

<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>In ancient times, sailors of a certain country were traveling at sea. One day, they landed on a sandy beach on the coast, and made a stove to cook their rice. When they finished eating and dismantled the temporary stove, the sand under the stove had all turned into sparkling things. They were very strange and could not understand where these strange things came from. After scientists studied it, they realized that it was because when they cooked the rice, they melted the sand grains on the beach, and the ash from the wood combined to form this sparkling thing 丨丨 glass.</p>
<p>Children! We know that the main components of glass are: silicic acid, lime, and alkali. Ordinary sand contains sand acid and lime. And wood ash is an alkaline substance, so their compound became the transparent glass we have now.</p>
<p>Children! Sand grains and wood ash are all very ugly and useless things. After artificial compounding, they can be transformed into such beautiful and pure objects. Children! Isn't this very strange?</p>

<h3 id="e30">Law and the Women's Movement <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Ziz Jiu</p>
<p>Law was originally intended to protect people, and it is created by the people themselves. However, in many countries, laws are often used by rulers to mold the ruled. It represents a "beneficial organization" for the rulers. Therefore, to understand the hierarchical relationship between classes or genders in a country, one can often look at the laws of that country. In past draft civil codes of China, there was a provision stating that "only those who have reached adulthood and have the ability to discern shall have the capacity to act, but wives are not included in this category." According to civil law, those with limited capacity to act include "minors" and "the mentally ill." To treat a normal person—a woman—as if she were mentally ill is infuriating. However, this precisely illustrates how past Chinese laws defined the status of women. Although current Chinese laws are nominally much more progressive than in the past, in a society where Chinese women as a whole have not achieved genuine equality, these laws will certainly not be completely fair. The recently amended criminal code does have some progress, but the chapters on "abortion," "obstructing morality," and "obstructing marriage and family" still contain clauses that do not consider the interests of the majority of women.</p>
<p>Recently, women's groups in Nanjing have argued that Article 239 of the current criminal law passed by the Legislative Yuan—"a married woman who commits adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, and the adulterer shall be punished similarly"—only imposes penalties on women, while a married man who commits adultery is not subject to legal sanctions. This still reflects an outdated and one-sided view of chastity, which violates the principles of gender equality espoused by the Party and the country. They expressed their opposition through publicity and petitions, which were carried out simultaneously. Women's groups in various regions are also responding one after another. This clearly demonstrates that Chinese women today are not the same as Chinese women of the past. The oppressed are gradually rising up! Although merely seeking empty legal equality is not the true goal of women's liberation, resisting in this way is far better than passively accepting. This</p>
<h3 id="e31">Facts of the Attack <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>The Legislative Yuan's recent reinstatement of the provision "a married woman who commits adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year," while deleting the clause in the draft law that criminalized a married man committing adultery, has stirred up minor ripples. Women from all walks of life in the capital have organized the League for Striving for Equality Before the Law, sending telegrams to various places seeking support; this adds a few fallen leaves to the otherwise still-water-like women's movement of recent years.</p>
<p>The honorable members of the Legislative Yuan debated this clause intensely, seemingly without any fear. Ultimately, they concluded that in our China, a man straying from his family, abandoning his moral integrity, and engaging in adultery with another woman is truly a trivial matter! To punish him for this would make the law a laughingstock, hence its deletion. Moreover, the majority of women currently depend on their "provider" for survival; even if the clause were not deleted, they would have no recourse against their "provider." Given the reality, the honorable members merely followed the prevailing trend. The main sentiment regarding this new criminal law lies not in the failure to balance the penalties for men and women, but in relying on the law to maintain marital relationships. At best, such security in the family is equivalent to using medicine to prolong life. Most people are free to roam and frolic in the natural open spaces, increasing their health; if they are forcibly confined to a secret room, though they may avoid catching a cold or cough, can they truly be free from the threat of illness? If marital relationships are not based on love, the "old ways" from before the New Culture Movement will be reenacted today.</p>
<p>Secondly, the law's accommodation of reality is a cause for concern. The inability to establish a case against a married man committing adultery, and the reduction of the age of consent for women in rape cases from sixteen to fourteen, are both due to existing realities. In fact, realities can be wrong to an extreme degree, but justice cannot be distorted even slightly. If the law truly upholds justice, it should simply kick away unequal and ugly realities. However, this cannot be expected today. Not only in China, but also in the League of Nations formed by imperialists, everything is judged based on established facts; after the loss of the Northeast, our cries to them are known to be futile.</p>
<p>Empty words are inferior to practical action. Given the current situation where women's economic independence is lacking, laws ensuring gender equality will not exist; even if they do, they will be mere formalities. Only by seizing real economic power can we have a weapon to destroy these unequal realities and realize our equal laws.</p>
<p>The most frightening thing is the slave mentality of submitting to established facts, which is deeply rooted in society; because the women's world sees the reality of male dominance and female inferiority, women everywhere facing obstacles, even though new ideas have been introduced for more than a decade, the moment someone shouts the doctrine of virtuous wives and good mothers, they are willing to abandon the struggle for economic power in society and return to the family!</p>
<p>In fact, what does reality even count for? Reality is not cast in iron; as long as enough effort is put in, can't even things cast in iron be broken?</p>
<h3 id="e32">Why We Oppose Article 239 of the Criminal Law Amendment <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Green Child</p>
<p>After Article 239 of the Criminal Law Amendment, namely "a married woman who commits adultery shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year, and the other party in the adultery shall be subject to the same punishment," was passed, women's circles in Beijing believed this was an insult to women's dignity and violated the major principle of gender equality, and proposed opposition and requested modification.</p>
<p>Some say that even if equality is achieved in law, men and women cannot be truly equal. Indeed, in the current Chinese society where feudal ideas have not been broken, the influence of old ethics has not been eliminated, and economic power is still in the hands of men, even if the law stipulates gender equality, women still cannot enjoy the same rights as men in reality. For example, regarding the matter of committing adultery, even if the law stipulates that regardless of gender, anyone who is married and commits adultery shall be subject to corresponding penalties, most women, because they have to rely on men economically, and because they are bound by the idea of "a woman being faithful to one man until death" passed down for thousands of years, even if her husband commits adultery, how can she, like a man, use this law, the result of which would offend the other party or lead to divorce?</p>
<p>However, even if the provisions of Article 239 itself do not have a significant impact on Chinese women at present, the thinking expressed by this amendment is something we cannot but oppose.</p>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to the trends of the world and the evolution of social civilization recognizes that women and men make equally valuable contributions to society. Everyone recognizes that gender equality and cooperation are the way to promote society and make it perfect. Only by acknowledging the theory and reality of gender equality can a country and society progress. If our country is willing to be a culturally backward country, then so be it; otherwise, this kind of thinking that goes against world trends and hinders the evolution of the country and society cannot be allowed to exist.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the dignity of women, in order to uphold the truth of gender equality that is ordained by heaven and earth, and in order to seek social progress and human happiness, we vow to oppose this unequal amendment to the death. November 8th, Nanjing</p>

<h3 id="e34">Economic Independence is a Prerequisite for Sexuality (Continued) <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Hua</p>
<p>As a result of the industrial revolution in 18th-century England, tens of thousands of poor women who were abused by men broke through the dike like a raging tide, flowing out of their confined and narrow homes and dedicating themselves to the productive cause of human happiness. Although they expended more labor than cattle and horses, earning only enough wages to survive, they further advanced a shared fate of enduring exploitation with the proletariat. In terms of economics, this segment of women gained a considerable opportunity for independence; it must have been something for women themselves to approach the "path to freedom."</p>
<p>Naturally, this situation was still tragic for women. The conclusion of enduring extreme hardship to earn a living, in terms of the essence of capitalism, apart from promoting the unity of all the oppressed who are dissatisfied with their own existence, this group of women, like women enslaved in families, has not received any happiness bestowed by capitalist society.</p>
<p>The power holders of society are male-centered!! This explains that all conditions that are beneficial to men, like iron pillars that have not been eroded by wind and rain, still stand safely around the power holders! The periphery of men.</p>
<p>More importantly, habitual prejudices and inherited morals, like deeply planted roots, are deeply rooted in the human heart and have become the difficult-to-remove bedrock on the road to women's liberation.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to the women's rights movement inspired by the French Democratic Revolution, the bright future is still equivalent to a hazy distant view, and women are merely making efforts in the game of quenching their thirst with plums. Moreover, this is limited to a minority of a minority of women's embellishment, 丨this obscures women's longing for liberation, what does it have to do with the masses of women who are suppressed and seek to survive by gentle means?</p>
<p>However, the masses of women must clearly recognize: the liberation of "sexuality" begins with "economic independence!" This point is not only declared to us very definitely by history; even in the reality surrounding women's daily lives, we can find many unpleasant things between the sexes, and our own constraints and misery, all of which must be solved in this important grasp.</p>
<p>Let's take a simple example: Suppose a proletarian woman can earn wages through labor, and hardship is thereby eased, and relationships can be more free and pleasant; a middle-class woman, through gaining a profession, increases her independent dignity in the feudal shackles; and upper-class women, through occupying a profession, do not sink deeper into the abyss of idleness.</p>
<p>These are all practical examples found in women's lives after the industrial revolution and the democratic movement. 丨In their efforts for "economic independence," they have gained some "sexual" freedom, and the shackles of slavery have been destroyed. Women who are subjected to oppression should use their whole lives to diagnose the root cause of their suffering and endure their misery, and grasp it with their whole lives.</p>
<p>Liberating women from all "inhuman" states requires women's own efforts! Just as slaves cannot obtain the assistance of landlords, women cannot hope for the assistance of men to liberate themselves from "sexuality."</p>
<p>In today's society of economic panic and political disorder, using marriage as a means of profession is a relationship that is even more showing unstable and unreliable tendencies, and women still think this is the way out, and rush forward on this wrong path, the result of which will only further promote this group of women to become more and more lowly; in order to save this cursed phenomenon, "economic independence" is an even more urgent issue to understand.</p>
<p>From real life, there are many progressive women who give us answers to this question, which are most worthy of attention. With a brave spirit, they walked out of the family bound by feudal chains, and fearlessly despised the morals formed by customs that are designed to fool women, and came to the crowds of society with difficulty and struggle; the first thing that occupies her heart is the liberation from shameful sexual subordination, and first seek the way out of "economic independence"; due to this recognition and grasp, they have gained freedom and dignity in life. Look, what kind of posture do new women live in? Crude and small dwellings, and frugal daily consumption, while containing the inner demands of that simple appearance, is the pursuit of spiritual upliftment; in the dual meaning of self and society, how much endurance and difficulty do they fight with hardship; or labor all day for production, or run and cry out for the oppressed, or satisfy their meaning to life from various occupations. Therefore, the relationship between the sexes, for them, is a combination for a healthier advance of the spirit, they choose a man who is in harmony with their interests and career freely with the qualifications of a "person" to complete the needs of love. Compared to women who are economically subordinate, 丨On the one hand, live freely in a bright environment due to economic independence; on the other hand, being trampled on like slaves, gloomy and depressed, or aging their years by drunken life and death; 丨What a difference in life!</p>
<p>Although individual economic independence, as history has shown us, cannot liberate women, and the panic of unemployment is precisely the huge wave set off by this era, but on the eve of the coming era of storms, women must grasp the ring of "economic independence" to step into the road to freedom!</p>
<h3 id="e35">The So-Called "Daughter's Classic" <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Fei</p>
<p>"The value of movies in culture and education is undeniable, and those who work in it, such as managers, directors, actors, and even shareholders, often pride themselves on promoting culture and assisting education, and in recent years, this trend has become even more obvious. I am a layman in this field, and I am not qualified to say anything about the artistic value of movies themselves, but because I am not a proponent of art for art's sake, I very much approve of the trend in the film industry.</p>
<p>The so-called "drama," whether on stage or screen, always involves "expressing life" and "instructing life," but I think our film industry has simply failed to do what it should have done in the latter aspect! Some have even intentionally or unintentionally gone astray. I say this not to deny the efforts of our film industry in recent years, but to hope that the film industry will value its mission and cherish its career, and think more before selecting topics and producing films: so that every film, when it first shows, does not make oneself and the audience lose their spirit, time, and money in vain, and always contributes something to satisfy people! I think whether the subject matter, content, and consciousness are correct or not has a great relationship with the audience's future, and the money, energy, and time spent are the same, so I sincerely hope that the film industry will unanimously make its best efforts!</p>
<p>Enough of idle talk, please allow me to review the so-called "Daughter's Classic":</p>
<p>I don't know if it's because this year is some kind of women's year, but there are really many movies with women as the subject matter this year! Take the productions of the Star Film Company as an example: from "Sister Flowers," "Three Sisters," "Street Corner Roses," to the so-called "Daughter's Classic," good gracious, how prosperous! But when you investigate how they are labeled for women's lives, it is very regrettable. For example: In "Sister Flowers," not pointing out the evils of the private property system; poor women should resolutely struggle to be independent; but teaching a poor sister to go with the younger sister of the warlord's mistress! In "Three Sisters," using the same consciousness as "Sister Flowers," the three sisters accompany their old mother to rely on a wealthy young master, so that they are all trampled by him; and it is very unreasonable for a gentle and elegant eldest sister to beat the strong and powerful wealthy young master to death and surrender herself! In "Street Corner Roses," it exposes the evils of the city, but does not point out the root of the city's evils! Calling women to return to the countryside, but forgetting that the countryside has long been bankrupt! As for the so-called "Daughter's Classic," it is a film in which all the directors and actors participate! The content is also quite rich, but what did it instruct the audience? Only heaven knows! Its consciousness is not only consistent, but also deteriorating, what is said about the "Daughter's Classic!" It's simply the "Grandma's Classic"! Please allow me to continue:</p>
<p>Although the "Daughter's Classic" includes many types of women, progressive women are excluded, 丨They started with a Double Tenth Festival celebration banquet, and ended with a lantern festival, and even a type of woman like He Xiangning, who devoted her life to the country and the people, and still thinks about national affairs and the masses when she is old and sick, is missing! Such intentional evasion of reality, so that women cannot see their future, only symbolized by storms, and Xuan Jinglin said, we must find a way out in the storm, who knows what it is? The segment starring Hu Die (including Gu Meiqun) simply cannot get rid of the old-fashioned romantic novel's stench of a young master encountering a disaster, and the young lady saving him; or a happy reunion of heroes and beauties! Revolution is a daily and continuous arduous struggle, not so romantic, this distortion of facts, to tell a joke: or intentionally to make a joke on the successful individual revolutionaries, that would be interesting, but unfortunately we cannot misinterpret it for them, other segments are more realistic, but it is very possible to show it to our grandmother and earn some old tears, but it is really useless for today's women, from Xuan Jinglin's segment, because of the decline of color and being abandoned, since she has become an escaping "Nora", she naturally needs independence, but the bankruptcy of our past and present women's education, and the disadvantage of virtuous mothers and good wives to women, has not been pointed out, Yan Yuexian's segment, the fact that women deal with men is entirely due to men chasing other opposite sexes, however, the result gives people the impression of a slippery woman, similarly, Xu Lai's segment, first gives her the title of a socialite, and then describes her romance and uninhibitedness, without a heart, but the crime of the male-dominated society's idle rich chasing Zhang and Zhu playing with women is gently covered up, try where these efforts were used? Zhu Qiuhen's segment can be regarded as exposing the situation of the bourgeoisie destroying women, but it is only passively portrayed, and does not actively point out that women's dangerous fate, and the disaster of the oppressed people, is entirely a matter of the entire social system, the way out for women is that a total solution can only be obtained in the new social order, Gao Qianpin's segment, sincerely reveals the eyes of the so-called upper-class female celebrities on the women's rights movement, and also gained a lot of ridicule from the audience, but is this phenomenon accidental? What is strange under the general consciousness of men who demand virtuous mothers and good wives on the one hand, and hope that their wives and daughters will be in the limelight on the other? In the final analysis, in this unequal society, who is to blame? However, in this segment, we only see the women being portrayed to the fullest, as for the men, they have no fault, which is probably due to the fact that the directors and playwrights are all men! Xu Qinfang's segment depicts a woman who is addicted to gambling and finally commits suicide, calling people to feel that she is more to blame for herself! As for the selfish man who is accustomed to confining women to the family, not allowing her to have proper socializing, not allowing her to have proper entertainment, but he himself indulges in prostitution and gambling all day long, or runs around to raise money, so that the woman is lonely and bored and forced to gamble, is also covered up! The rest is Xia Peizhen's segment, which is unanimously praised by film critics. Yes, a woman has a consumptive doctor who is poverty-stricken and sick, and a child who is still carrying her, and it is enough to rely on herself to broadcast and make a living. Years have been enough to endure, and unfortunately her husband died and she lost her child! It is really a great tragedy in life! However, the society is so evil, the human system is so unbearable for human life, it has not been further prompted, and I feel regretful, but unexpectedly, a proper common sense of women's daily life is also denied in this segment! In this segment, when Xia Peizhen saw Zhao Dan kissing the child, she habitually stopped him loudly, just because of this, the man felt that life was poor and sick, to the point where he could not even get close to his own child, and went crazy in pain, and ran out in the wind and rain, until he died, when he still did not come back for dinner, the woman regretted it very much, Xuan Peizhen said such a sentence to the child, "You have to let your father kiss you, then he will not go out!" This is really too wrong, unemployment and poverty are linked together, the fundamental reason lies in the fact that the Du Society's system is corrupt and no longer suitable for life, and he, although he was saddened by being prevented from kissing, however, it is right to prevent the kissing to prevent infection, but it should not be regretted! Although such irrational regret in the midst of emergency is normal human nature, I think changing a sentence can also express her mood at that time: "Dad was very good at first, but poverty and illness have made him bad-tempered!" Following the action, she could very well hug the child and follow it with sobs! Isn't it more realistic, more meaningful, and more moving?</p>
<p>The times are very solemn, we all need to be more solemn, but the living habits of our Chinese people are really too lacking in solemnity! The importance of the women's issue in the course of human liberation is known to everyone, and it takes the same effort to move it forward or backward! Hoping to reduce the tragedy of life, I would like to come to the same mind, and I hope that everyone can grasp the progressive consciousness and work hard forward!</p>

<h3 id="e38">A Visit to Miss Xia Peijun, a Female Employee of the Stationery Department of Wing On Company <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— By Wang Xianzhang</p>
<p>Early morning, the sun listlessly hung in the corner of the sky, its pale yellow light enveloping the people moving about on the road, bringing a slight sense of warmth.</p>
<p>A tram, like a monster, broke through the encirclement of sunlight, stopping, panting, in front of Sincere &amp; Co. I hurriedly squeezed out of the train's belly, like a sack of cotton, from the crowd, stretched my neck, exhaled, and quickly walked towards the entrance of (Wing On).</p>
<p>It was still early. Looking in through the tall, human-height glass doors, I saw three or five customers inside, drifting like fish with curious eyes, while the shop assistants idly, with greedy eyes, seemed to be appraising who among the customers was a genuine buyer, as if the customers were goods on display.</p>
<p>I stepped through the door amid their welcoming gazes, looking from south to north. The female staff in each section looked at me with expressions that were both questioning and welcoming. I immediately felt a sense of being a "non-customer," and a slight uneasiness arose in my heart.</p>
<p>Amid the scrutiny of many eyes, I quickly found my desired destination: "Conklin!" As I approached the gleaming glass counter, a female employee had already stood up, her face full of smiles, welcoming this extraordinary customer.</p>
<p>In a state of unease, I first explained my purpose to her; this was an excellent way to avoid disappointing her.</p>
<p>After I explained my hope to her, she asked in return, "What do you want this for?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't serve any great purpose, but writing it out for the general public will let them know what kind of life a female shop assistant leads. May I ask your surname, madam?" I explained to her, then asked.</p>
<p>"Xia—Peijun." She shyly lowered her head, avoiding my gaze, while arranging the various fountain pens displayed in the counter.</p>
<p>"Have you been working here long? Are you used to the life of a shop assistant?"</p>
<p>"Half a year. The life of a shop assistant isn't any different from other occupations for women; it's also intellectual labor. I feel that my abilities are only enough to be a shop assistant, so I'm quite satisfied with my current job." At this point, she began to open up: her demeanor was composed and unhurried, as if she were an orator, and a stream of great opinions rolled out of her mouth.</p>
<p>"You're too kind, too kind!" I said with a smile. "I'm afraid the life of a female shop assistant is a bit more difficult, isn't it? Could you tell me something about the pay and conditions here?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, there's nothing secret about it. The working hours here, neither too many nor too few, are from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., about eleven hours, with half an hour for lunch. We take turns eating, group by group, in the 'Dining Hall' on the fifth floor. The female shop assistants are probably in the third and fourth groups." As she spoke, she drew on the glass counter with her finger, with the same expression as an elementary school teacher explaining a mathematical formula.</p>
<p>"And?" I continued to ask.</p>
<p>"The compensation?" She smiled and said, "When I first came, it was seventeen yuan a month. In addition, there are six days of 'make-up work,' which is calculated every half year."</p>
<p>"The section you work in is probably the least troublesome here. There used to be a Miss Tan in this section, I wonder if you know her? The 'Conklin' section can be said to produce many talented people!" I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"I don't know who worked here before me, but I hope that even though 'Conklin' is famous, the people who work in the 'Conklin' section don't need to use it as a front. As for producing talented people, I certainly don't deserve the compliment. If we're talking about work ability, female shop assistants are always inferior to male shop assistants. For example, when it comes to carrying something a bit heavy, or reaching for something on the shelf, female shop assistants in any section need the help of male shop assistants. Understanding these various aspects, you can see that the work in the 'Conklin' section is the same as in other sections." She seemed a little averse to my mentioning "Conklin."</p>
<p>"Oh! I was referring to the fact that the customers who come for 'Conklin' are a bit more sophisticated than those in other sections." I wanted to explain my earlier question to her, so I mentioned the name "Conklin" again.</p>
<p>"That's hard to say. Often, many so-called intellectuals come to buy fountain pens, and from their words and actions, it seems they mostly come with some kind of extravagant expectation. My way of dealing with these people is to ignore everything except explaining the function and price of the goods, but I can't lose my composure." She couldn't help but smile as she said this.</p>
<p>"When you encounter such customers, have you ever regretted becoming a shop assistant?"</p>
<p>"There's no need to regret it; in China, women face such encounters in any profession. I had a considerable understanding of the life of a female shop assistant from books and stories even when I was studying.</p>

The contents are divided into columns such as "Short Essays," "Lectures on Literature," "Lectures on Philosophy," "Lectures on Science," and "Reading Q&amp;A," all of which use simple and accessible language to explain various scientific theories.

<p>but I still wanted to do it, even though I would sometimes suffer humiliation."</p>
<p>"Which school did you study at before?"</p>
<p>"Can I not say that?" She tilted her head and smiled.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if you say it." I urged.</p>
<p>"Patriotic." She said the two words decisively.</p>
<p>"Graduated, right? Why didn't you go to university?" I seemed to feel sorry for her.</p>
<p>"Well!" She hesitated for a moment and said, "I don't think that graduating from university would increase my status in society by much. If I wanted to study some kind of science, it certainly wouldn't be enough to just go to university. With this in mind, I preferred to be a shop assistant rather than a noble university student."</p>
<p>"Yes." I responded softly, then thought of another question and said, "Could you tell me a little about your private life?"</p>
<p>"That's too complicated, I can't say that much." She frowned, appearing a little unwilling.</p>
<p>"Just say a little! How do you relax after work?" I asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"When I go home at night, besides flipping through the newspaper of the day, I just go to sleep. Sometimes I play a round of 'golf' with my younger siblings: it doesn't cost any money, and it can be considered a kind of family exercise."</p>
<p>"Don't you go to the cinema much?" I listened to her for a long time and she hadn't mentioned this kind of entertainment, so I followed up with that question.</p>
<p>"Well!" She seemed a little embarrassed and said, "I do go, but not every day. Because watching movies can be both fun and a kind of education reflected from society. You can learn good things there, and you can also learn bad things: it's just a matter of 'the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom,' depending on whether each person's own will is pure. There's nothing inherently sinful in the movies themselves."</p>
<p>"Do you have any predetermined plans for your future direction? Can you say something about this question?" I asked with a serious attitude.</p>
<p>"This…" A slight blush rose on her face, but another thought quickly dispelled her shyness. She then said very readily, "I know what you're asking, and it's okay to say it. But I don't think it's the right time to talk about marriage yet. Not only do I feel that I'm still too young in terms of age, but I'm also still very far from my ideal career. Moreover, a woman's independence in life depends on laying a good foundation at this time, so that she won't become a passive animal in the future."</p>
<p>"Yes." I nodded as I looked at her. I expressed my admiration for her great opinions. I looked at the clock, which had already struck past nine. Feeling that it was inappropriate to continue talking, I said to her, "I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time, thank you!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, it's nothing!" She looked at me with a smile as I left the door.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Art and Science <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>In ancient society, there was no clear distinction between any social ideologies. Art and science were also the same, fused together and inseparable. At this time, an artwork can often be interpreted as a scientific object; similarly, in a scientific object, we can also see strong artistic significance. For example, the famous Egyptian pyramids are certainly ancient architectural art, but they are also textbooks of astronomy, geometry, and knowledge about the periodic flooding of the Nile River for the Egyptian monks of that time. Another example is the "Old Testament" Bible, which contains myths about the creation of heaven and earth, but to the people of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, whose level of knowledge was still relatively low, it was very real and reasonable, and can be said to be ancient science. At the same time, due to the wonder of its stories and the conciseness and beauty of its writing, it can also be said to be a kind of literature at that time. 丨丨From this, we can see that art and science were actually one thing in ancient times, and there was no distinction at all.</p>
<p>By modern times, the content of human life has become more complex and richer, and therefore the various ideologies generated by human life have rich content and independent forms, all showing the appearance of independent existence: the so-called art and science have also separated and existed independently in form, and developed. At this time, art increasingly relies on the power of concrete and vivid images to organize human thoughts and feelings, to understand life, and to decorate life. Science also increasingly relies on its abstract power of understanding to understand and guide human life. They are both striving to develop their respective functions; and, with the development of industry, the fields of art and science are also expanding. Obviously, film is a newly added department in the field of art, and the increasing number of other departments such as music and painting is also an undeniable fact. As for science, there are even more categories. In the past, it was divided into two major categories: natural science and social science. Recently, some people have added a cognitive science, so there are three major categories. Under these three major categories, there are many departments, and in these departments there are many divisions of labor. The complex phenomenon is really not something that can be explained in such a short article. 丨丨Thus, in modern society, we can not only say that art and science are separated in form, but also that their respective fields have certain characteristics and independent forms of existence.</p>
<p>Of course, modern art is by no means unrelated to science. In fact, art of realism and naturalism is closely combined with modern science. The naturalist critic Sainte-Beuve said: "I have only one interest, which is to analyze and select. I am a spiritual naturalist, and what I want to build is a natural history of literature." At the same time, Zola also said: "Our responsibility is to analyze anger and love, and to see clearly how these various emotions exert their influence in the human body. Our point of view is a new point of view, a point of view that is becoming experimental rather than philosophical: in short, the experimental method: in literature as in science, it is engaged in determining the personal and social natural phenomena that metaphysics used to explain irrationally and supernaturally." Isn't this a clear expression that literature and art must be suitable for science? In fact, all writers of realism and naturalism objectively and scientifically depict reality.</p>
<p>However, the combination of modern realism and naturalism art with modern science is different from the combination of ancient art with science. In any case, in modern society, art and science have been separated and independent in form. The art of realism and naturalism is only combined with modern science based on induction in essence, not like in ancient times: art and science are fused together and cannot be discussed separately in form.</p>

<h3 id="e42">On Problems Concerning Drama <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Lu</p>
<p>What is drama? Hamilton said in his "Theories of the Theatre": "Drama is the struggle between the wills of people, played by actors, held on stage, watched by the audience, whose performing power is emotion rather than reason, and whose method of performing is to express it through objective actions." Although this also touches on the characteristics of drama, it has some vague and unclear defects. Drama is a kind of literature. To explain the essence and function of drama concisely and appropriately, one must rely on the definition of literature and the characteristics inherent in drama itself. If literature is to communicate human thoughts and feelings by means of words or sometimes by actions or by language, by means of the power of vivid images, then drama is a kind of literature that communicates human thoughts and feelings artistically, more realistically, more concretely, and more vividly by means of stage performance.</p>
<p>Some people believe that stage performance cannot become a major element of drama because they have seen that some scripts, although they cannot be performed on stage, are also called drama. However, this is incorrect. The problem is very obvious. Dramatic works that cannot be performed on stage can naturally also be called dramatic creations, but if one therefore says that stage performance has nothing to do with drama, then one is denying the meaning of the existence of drama, because drama is meant to be performed on stage by actors for the audience to see. No matter what kind of dramatic work, its form is always combined with stage art. No matter what kind of dramatic work, there are always contents such as "characters in the play" and "realistic situations"... As for whether the work is convenient for stage performance, that is another matter. Dramatic works that cannot be performed on stage naturally do not lose their qualification for dramatic creation, but works of that form that have nothing to do with stage art cannot be called dramatic creations. Shakespeare has many plays that are not easy to perform on stage, but if these creations were not composed in the form of drama but in the form of novels or poetry or even some incongruous form, then they would not be qualified to be called drama; the reason why they are still called drama even though they cannot be performed on stage is because they have the unique form of drama that is closely related to stage art.</p>
<p>Yusaku Yokoyama of Japan said in his "Introduction to Literature": "Drama is a complex art that integrates many arts丨丨poetry, music, painting, dance, and architecture丨丨, so it is a form in literature that is subject to the most material restrictions." This is correct in a general explanation. But if one therefore says that the form of drama is fixed and unchanging, then one is absolutizing the problem. Although drama is a form that is subject to many material restrictions, its form changes with the changes of the times and society, and there is no one form of drama that can dominate the drama world of ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. A very obvious example is: the so-called "unities" form in drama, which classicism considered to be the golden rule, believing that all plays must follow this form, but the great playwright Shakespeare was the first to come out to destroy it, and he achieved great success because of it; the French Romantics even raised a clear banner against it, and the famous Hugo also satirized and ridiculed it as much as possible in the preface to his long historical drama "Cromwell";... 丨丨From this it can be seen that although drama has many restrictions in form, these restrictions are not fixed, but change with the changes of the times and society.</p>
<p>Because drama conveys thoughts and feelings more directly, more realistically, more concretely, and more vividly, its relationship with society is particularly obvious. A successful dramatic work must clearly express a social consciousness and be supported by a group of social people. Everyone knows that there is an interesting story in the history of French literature, that is 丨丨 when Hugo's famous play "Hernani" was staged at the Théâtre Français in Paris, the classical writers all sat in the upper floors and other places of the theater, whistling to hinder the acting; while the Romantic writers and young people who sympathized with them gathered in the stalls below to defend against them, and the famous Gautier even wore an eye-catching red vest and directed all his comrades under the stage with his long hair; This very clearly shows how deep the relationship between drama and human society is.</p>

<h3 id="e43">German Doctor Visits the Four-Fingered People in Spain <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Bolun</p>
<p>Each hand has only four fingers</p>
<p>There are dozens of such people</p>
<p>Madrid, Spain Correspondence</p>
<p>In the village of Bertorrasa in Spain, there is a family called Harola A. They are the leaders of this village, and can almost be said to be in control of all the real power in this village. Their ancestors, hundreds of years ago, were the lords of a city, and were heroes who dominated Egypt and Arabia. If you go to the village of Bertorrasa now to visit the family of Harola A, you can still see many majestic portraits of his ancestors.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing in these portraits of heroes that is unbelievable, that is, their hands are never exposed in their portraits. Those who do not understand the situation of this family will naturally not be surprised, but precisely because the fingers and toes of the Harola A family are now one less than ordinary people, it is somewhat strange. Now, the Harola A family, from the elderly in their eighties and nineties to the children in their fours and fives, have only four fingers on each hand and each foot. Therefore, people speculate that their ancestors were probably also four-fingered, otherwise, why would their portraits not show their hands?</p>
<p>If the heroic ancestors were four-fingered, then this is a very interesting question, and this situation is just like Mendel's law in genetics. Not long ago, German Dr. Gurthir Kuster went to the village of Bertorrasa to visit the family of Harola A, and published the course of the visit in a German news magazine, which greatly aroused the attention of the world.</p>
<p>It is said that the head of the Harola A family is now an old man of nearly ninety years old. He skillfully manages this village. No matter what happens in the village, the general people will run to the old man's house, describe the beginning and end of the event in detail, and then the old man will support his chin with four fingers, listening to them talk with great interest, and finally give instructions to these people in a few words.</p>
<p>The son of the old man Harola A naturally has four fingers on each hand, and so does his daughter-in-law. Because there is a rule in the Harola A family that anyone who is not four-fingered is not allowed to marry. In fact, what ordinary people would be willing to marry such four-fingered men and women? Therefore, there are many four-fingered people in this village. There are almost dozens of men and women under this bloodline, and they occupy a great power in the village.</p>
<p>In this way, people will suspect that perhaps the Harola A family will gradually develop and create a unique group of people in a few thousand years, or even become an independent country. However, this is somewhat of an overconcern, because their productivity is smaller than that of ordinary people and their mortality rate is higher. Perhaps in a few thousand years they will no longer exist in the world. However, in any case, their existence is a very wonderful thing in the present.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The content and form of drama are naturally strictly regulated by the times and society, but it also has a reaction to the times and society; and because it can use the stage as a medium to directly convey human thoughts and feelings, its reaction to society is particularly significant. It can make people laugh, cry, scream wildly, and even change people's thoughts and directly affect society. The role of French court drama in maintaining despotism and the power of old Chinese drama in supporting old Chinese society can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>National Production and Construction Enterprises</p>
<h3 id="e44">Soviet Public Dining Halls <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Bowen</p>
<p>Public dining halls are an important step in transforming the individual economy of the small self into a large-scale socialist social economy. This is especially important for women, as it can liberate them from the drudgery of housework, enabling them to engage in industrial and agricultural production. The importance of public dining halls is not limited to improving the living conditions of workers and their families; its significance can also be seen in increasing production capacity, raising wages, and accelerating the production process, among other aspects.</p>
<p>During the First Five-Year Plan, the public dining hall enterprise experienced tremendous growth. In January 1929, according to the closest available statistics, the Soviet Union had 1,500 public dining halls, capable of serving 2.2 million meals daily. By 1933, the number of public dining halls had increased to 15,476, and the number of meals served daily had also increased to 30 million. In four years, the number of public dining halls had increased more than tenfold; the number of meals served had increased more than thirteenfold.</p>
<p>Today, 65 to 70 percent of workers employed by state industrial organizations eat in these public dining halls. Among them, metal workers account for 75 percent of the total, miners account for 62.5 percent, construction workers account for 74 percent, and transportation workers account for 68 percent. Every factory, every mine, every large organization has its own public dining hall to provide workers with hot meals.</p>
<p>This development is inseparable from the progress of Soviet industrial technology and mechanization. The establishment and development of new, large-scale factories and mines is an important reason for the transformation of small-scale handicraft dining halls into large-scale public dining halls. The old small restaurants and taverns have disappeared, replaced by a powerful new industry: the public dining hall enterprise.</p>
<p>The largest type of public dining hall is the kitchen factory. In January 1929, there were only three such factories in the entire Soviet Union, capable of serving only 60,000 meals daily. By 1933, the number of kitchen factories had increased to 106, and the number of meals they could serve had also increased to 3,316,000. Naturally, the number of small-scale public dining halls, numbering in the thousands, also increased year by year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the development of these public dining halls, various industries manufacturing cooking utensils, such as potato peelers, meat cleavers, dishwashers, and gas stoves, have also sprung up; these utensils were previously only produced by hand.</p>
<p>With such a material and technical foundation, the development of this public dining hall enterprise during the Second Five-Year Plan is undoubtedly assured. The most important issues now are how to build more kitchen factories and how to attach workshops for producing semi-finished food products to existing kitchen factories. The Soviet Union must produce food on a larger scale through mechanization to meet its current needs. This touches on the issue of improving the quality of food, which will determine the future development of the Soviet public dining hall enterprise. The issue of improving the quality of food has now become a very important issue and is being given attention. Indeed, many public dining halls are paying close attention to the quality and refinement of food, striving to make the food nutritious and delicious, and paying attention to how to better serve worker customers and maintain cleanliness. To encourage these efforts, the government has awarded prizes to various well-performing public dining halls. For example, many public dining halls in Moscow, Leningrad, and Donbas have received such awards. Many small-scale dining halls are using these dining halls as models, striving to improve the quality of food.</p>
<p>Experience indicates that whether food is refined and palatable is largely a matter of culinary skills. Culinary specialists are essential. Now, major kitchen factories are paying attention to the training of high-level technical personnel, such as senior chefs, food chemists, and economists, and have achieved considerable success. Old-fashioned cooks who prepare food based on their own taste are no longer needed or valued in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Regarding the training of chefs, previously, even in the most elegant restaurants, it was only a matter of apprentice-based private cooking techniques being passed down, but now it is different. In 1931, the Federal Public Dining Hall Trust opened three specialized schools in Moscow, Leningrad, and Luhansk to train high-level culinary technical personnel. These schools are entirely innovative, and their purpose is naturally to train senior chefs, food chemists, and economists.</p>
<p>In addition to these specialized schools, the Soviet Union now also has 24 culinary technical schools with a total of 6,297 students, and 93 junior technical schools with a total of 16,833 students. The latter train personnel to prepare intermediate and lower-quality foods.</p>

<p>It is undeniable that woodcut art originated in China. According to researchers, its history is no less ancient than that of painting. However, this art form, this Chinese product, has been abandoned for a long time. Its revival is only a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Through the evolution of time, woodcut art has become wildly popular in various Western European countries, as well as in Japan in East Asia. In its homeland, many enthusiasts are also researching and creating woodcuts.</p>
<p>Woodcuts can express the lines of all scenes using the fundamental colors of human visual illusion—black and white—so they have gained an important position in the art world.</p>
<p>Introductions in various Chinese newspapers and magazines have made us aware of the efforts of those engaged in woodcut art. Exhibitions in various places have also given us some impressions and stimuli. Now, authors in North China such as Xu Lunyin and Zhao Ye have initiated a national woodcut joint exhibition, scheduled to be held for the first time in Peiping in the New Year, followed by continuous exhibitions in Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places, to promote woodcut art throughout the country. Their correspondence address is the Preparatory Office of the National Woodcut Joint Exhibition, P.O. Box 5, Beichen Newspaper, Peiping. The collection of works is not limited by the number of people or the number of works, but they must be sent by December 25th.</p>
<p>This grand exhibition is an innovation in our country. It is hoped that many people will participate and that substantial works will be presented to the audience at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Remembering Mr. Li Shicen <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Zhenyu</p>
<p>The death of Mr. Li Shicen is at least a great loss to the Chinese academic world!</p>
<p>I only met Mr. Li Shicen a few times, and perhaps he didn't have much of an impression of me at the time. This is because there were too many young people who came into contact with him, and it was really not easy to remember the faces of everyone he had met once or twice. However, the impression that Mr. Li Shicen left on me was particularly profound, and I will never forget it. This is not to say that his face had any features that were different from others, making it easy for me to remember, but rather because he had a kind of humor that was unmatched by others, which etched an indelible longing in my memory.</p>
<p>I first met Mr. Li Shicen at New China College. This college was jointly organized by some faculty and staff and students from China Public School, which had been destroyed by the "January 28th Incident." Because Mr. Li Shicen had a bit of a friendship with Mr. Hu Yaomei of the general affairs department, Mr. Li Shicen still came to teach on time, even though New China College was so poor at the time that it often couldn't pay salaries. Mr. Hu and I were from the same hometown, and when we had nothing to do, we often sneaked into his place to chat. One day, I met Mr. Li Shicen unintentionally. At that time, I didn't know that this person who had just entered the door was one of China's leading philosophers, because he was wearing a semi-new Western suit, and his stature was not tall. At first glance, he really didn't look like a scholar with profound knowledge. Later, Mr. Hu introduced me, and I realized that this was Mr. Li Shicen, whom I had longed to meet because of the long letter he had written to Ms. Tong. After we shook hands for the first time, we just chatted casually for a few words, and he left first. From this time on, his profound impression was etched in my memory. Mr. Hu later told me that he taught philosophy at New China College, coming twice a week. If I had nothing to do, I could come to listen to his lectures.</p>
<p>I accepted Mr. Hu's kindness and got up early on the day he taught, rushing to New China College. As soon as I stepped into the classroom, I saw that the seats inside were already filled with people. Among these many students, half of them were studying other subjects but came to listen to the lecture out of admiration. It was almost nine o'clock when I got there. I saw that there were no seats, so I had to [left blank space] find an empty spot [left blank space] well [left blank space]. After waiting for more than ten minutes, Mr. Li Shicen walked in with a black briefcase. The noisy atmosphere in the classroom became as quiet as if it had been washed with water after he came in. Every student silently sent him to the podium with eager eyes.</p>
<p>That day, he was lecturing on "Introduction to Philosophy." Later, even more people came to listen to the lecture. Usually, no professor at New China College had more than 30 students in their class, but that day, almost everyone was there.</p>
<p>His attitude when lecturing on philosophy was sometimes serious and sometimes humorous. Those who listened to his lectures at the time would feel the shortness of time, as if his class was over in no time. In fact, it was because his teaching was effective that people didn't get tired of listening, so later many students who hadn't taken his class changed to his class, and those who were already taking his class also asked the school authorities to increase his hours, but later, because the school was in financial difficulties, the students' requests were not realized after all!</p>
<p>It is said that there was also a most interesting time: when he was lecturing, other professors were also lecturing at the same time, but later, the students of this professor sneaked into his classroom one by one to listen to his philosophy. This professor felt very embarrassed. Later, in order to appease the many other professors, the school authorities specially changed his teaching time to not coincide with any professor, so as to avoid the students from making a fuss about deserting their posts again.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Farewell, Shanghai <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yunping</p>
<p>My expectations for this "Farewell, Shanghai!" were not very high, so when I walked out of the gate of Jincheng, I felt slightly satisfied. Although China's new cinema, due to various reasons, prevents filmmakers from working entirely according to their own ideas, its growth and progress are clearly visible. Even in the case of "Farewell, Shanghai!", although the vivid depiction of reality has been omitted, the author's intention is undeniable, and the technical achievements of this film are also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>First of all, I might as well talk about the director's efforts. The director did not use new techniques here, but he has a good understanding of existing directing techniques. We cannot ignore his various fairly beautiful and flexible shots because of some inappropriate editing and the overuse of subtitles. Particularly worth mentioning is the use of fast-motion shooting of several alarming shots from different angles when the ship ran aground, and the protagonist's sketching of streetcars rushing by in front of the Wang family's house after arriving in Shanghai, to indicate the passage of the journey and time. From these places, it can be seen that the director has considerable intelligence and experience. The insertion of urban night scenes is also quite sufficient to create an atmosphere of urban prosperity and the protagonist's current difficult situation. The director has quite appropriately used tracking shots, overhead shots, and composite shots, which is also a reason for making the picture quite lively and watchable.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Ruan Lingyu's acting skills are not particularly outstanding, but there is nothing incompetent about it either. She did her best with what the script required of her. She has even more noteworthy achievements in inner expression. She was able to convey the feelings of love and hate and inner distress when she lost her son and when she was a dancer without being excessive and appropriately. Zhang Yi has no acting skills, and his lack of good performance is quite related to the script itself. He Feiguang's villainous role is very well acted.</p>
<p>Of course, this "Farewell, Shanghai!" is not a very mature work. A certain degree of achievement in directing techniques and the personal efforts of the actors can hardly compensate for the defects of the entire work. The fatal flaw of this work should be the inappropriateness of the story. In the development of the story itself, we found many unbelievable and unrealistic places. The lack of a sense of reality is a major key to the failure of a work. "Farewell, Shanghai!" relies too much on chance and coincidence, which is a reason why it cannot get a higher evaluation. Starting with the ship running aground to bring out the relationship between Ruan Lingyu and Zhang Yi, this way of unfolding the story is somewhat unnatural after all. The ship running aground and passengers losing their luggage into the "sea" also seems like child's play. As for Bai Lu "coincidentally" suffering from a cold due to a long journey after arriving at the Wang family's house, in order to lead to her rape by Wu Guanghui, and later the child's critical illness, with the second landlord hiring a doctor on his behalf, and the doctor being "precisely" Wu Guanghui - this method of using "coincidence" and accidental encounters as the basis for the development of the story is really clumsy. In addition, the ambiguity of the theme, the screenwriter's lack of courage to face reality, and the weakness of his creative attitude are all reasons why the audience cannot get anything from this. Any work, even if it has a high degree of technical achievement, but if it ignores the health of the content, it will be difficult to meet the current needs of the times. "Farewell, Shanghai!" will lose its importance under such conditions and will easily fade in the memory of the audience.</p>

<p>Genfu (Slaps him again) Shut your mouth! (Li finally stops talking)</p>
<p>Voices "Go, let's go in!" "Beat! Beat that dog thing!" "Go look for rice!"</p>
<p>(People all crowd in, looking for rice and food everywhere. They smash some beautiful things, and take away what they can. Master Qi, Li, Jianmin, Chen, Qiyun, etc. are all pale with fright.)</p>
<p>Genfu (To Guizhen) Didn't I tell you that the poor always have a way when they are together? Besides doing disgraceful things, there are other ways to eat. You almost made a huge mistake - how did you think of begging that kind of (pointing to Li) vicious villain?</p>
<p>Guizhen I was confused, I was muddled;... I don't know what I was thinking just now... Is Daddy going to die?</p>
<p>Genfu Daddy will die of heat and starvation even if he doesn't hang himself. There's no use in us being sad. Let's go get some rice too. (Goes to the inner room. People are in a commotion for about a few minutes, and then they take one or two pieces of food each, satisfied, and disperse.)</p>
<p>Genfu (Comes out with a bag of rice in his hand, to Master Qi, etc.) Thank you. (Goes down with Guizhen)</p>
<p>Li (And Ms. Wang, Jianmin, etc. wake up Master Qi) They're gone! Gone!</p>
<p>Master Qi (Dizzy, rambling) Hot! The wind is like fire!... Where is this?... Oh, I can't stand it... Who are you?... Please don't make things difficult for me... I'm a poor man... I don't have any money... I don't have a penny... You can't rob my rice... It's hot! You can't rob me!</p>
<p>Continued on page five</p>

<p>Ms. Wang They're far away! Far away!</p>
<p>Master Qi I'm dying of heat! I can't stand it! You'd better take my old life away too!... I don't want to live anymore!... You don't pay me back, and you want to rob my rice... (Looks very uncomfortable) The hot wind... burns my face like fire... I can't stand it!... (Looking like he's chasing after something) You must leave it for me... You must not take it away... I'm going to report you to the county! You gang of robbers!</p>
<p>Ms. Wang (To Li) He's fainted!</p>
<p>Li (Suggesting) Help him to the inner room to smoke some opium!</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Okay! (They help Master Qi into the inner room) Master Qi refuses to go in, waving his hands wildly, still shouting, "No, no, no!" Down)</p>
<p>Jianmin (Watching him go) This... this is no good... It looks like I won't be able to go to Shanghai again this year.</p>
<p>Qiyun (Quite displeased) I don't care! Whoever wants to suffer with you in this countryside! And be scared! And frightened! I have to go to Shanghai no matter what. (Walks aside to show her determination.)</p>
<p>Jianmin (There's nothing he can do, wants to say something but stops) Alas!!! (Goes over and makes a pleading expression.)</p>
