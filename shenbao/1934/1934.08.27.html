<h3 id="c7">孔子之人格與時代精神 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 邵元冲</p>
<p>（孔子誕辰紀念作）</p>
<p>比者中樞爲倡導國民培養精神上之人格、遂以八月二十七日孔子誕辰、定爲先師孔子紀念日、以闡揚孔子之學說、於糾正年來浮靡之風習所繫甚大、按孔子誕辰向有數說、由公羊榖梁傳所記、謂在魯襄　公二十一年已酉十月庚子、即陰歷十月二十一日、明宋景濂氏主之、黃梨洲據左氏傳哀公十六年夏四月已丑孔丘卒、以爲此出於門弟子所記、歲月無復可疑、並證以史記家語、杜預左氏傳註、孔子家譜祖庭記、皆謂孔子年七十三、則由哀公十六年上推至襄公廿二年庚戌、於年始合、應認史記孔子世家魯襄公二十二年孔子生之說爲確、而推定孔子之生爲襄公二十二年酉月庚子、即爲陰歷八月二十七日、與羅泌路史所考定者相同、今以陽歷代之者、蓋取便習慣也、</p>
<p>孔子之學旣涵蓋二千數百年來、中國之政治思想、倫理哲學、社會道德、教育原理諸端、故實不易一一博論之、且中國一切舊有之載籍、幾無不受孔子學說之影響、陳義太廣、勢亦必至泛濫無歸、故茲文所論、但取其有合於時代思想、及足以爲國民人格之儀型者、以爲感奮之資、博徵約守、力避艱深、斯亦靖獻之微意也、</p>
<p>（一）孔子之學術影響及其在中</p>
<p>華民族歷史上之地位</p>
<p>吾人本歷史之經騐、深信凡民族之能生息於世界而蟬嫣弗絕者、必有其民族之歷史焉、必有其民族之文化焉、必有其民族歷史上出類拔萃之人物焉、有歷史而後民族之精神得以光大發揚、有文化而後民族之進步得以拓展圓滿、有歷史上出類拔萃之人物、而後民族始有人格上之儀型、羣相摹傚、力爭上游、以維持民族之榮譽、此三者民族精神上必備之條件也、本此三者以研究孔子之歷史、則知孔子者實爲我中華民族鑄造此三大條件、以詒我後人、而樹立中華民族偉大之基礎者也、蓋中國古代之文化學術、每多散漫、雖周興而周公制禮作樂、創爲典範、規模燦然、然學術圖籍、猶藏之官府、非私人所得羣習、及孔子整理羣籍、躬自教授、闡發傳述、樹之風聲、而後學術得普及於衆、民族文化、由此勃興、教育之功、由是乃溥、則二千餘年來之中國文化、實以孔子爲承先啟後惟一之大師、此其在民族文化上之偉績也、民族以歷史爲其精神上之動力、而古史悠邈、傳聞異辭、及孔子刪定六經、以春秋爲紀事之史、而禮以紀典制、詩以紀民俗、書以紀誥誓、皆爲史之參佐、此章實齋所以有六經皆史之言、而後史學大昌、二千餘年來、弘編鉅製、蔚爲偉觀、雖其體裁未盡精善、於社會流變觀察較略、然已爲世界任何國家史部所望塵莫及、而國民觀摩漸漬、以喚起其民族精神者至鉅、此孔子於民族歷史上之建樹也、至孔子本身在歷史上之地位、實爲中華民族三宗之一、三宗者、黃帝軒轅氏筆路藍縷、拓土開疆、首奠華夏、立民族之始基、詒我後人於億萬年而無窮、實爲民族立國之始祖、此一宗也、唐虞之時、洪水泛濫、民生日蹙、大禹以十三年艱辛經營、平治水土、疎導諸川、然後民得安居、農業乃興、澤被民生、功在萬世、此一宗也、孔子祖述堯舜、憲章文武、博稽羣言、刪詩書、定禮樂、周遊諸國、闡揚經世之學、講學垂教、弟子三千人、通六藝者七十二人、繼往開來、紹往聖之絕業、集學術之大成、爲萬世之師表、此又一宗也、此三宗者、或創民族之始基、或被民生以溥利、或爲文化之宗師、皆以下開百代、使我中華民族得以卓立於大地、繼繼繩繩、昭垂無極、由此三宗儀型於前、而後聖哲賢繩、後先蔚起、學術事功、百途爭奮、而吾中華歷史乃燦然於大地、以鼓舞我民族黽勉前進、以陶鑄民族精神與增進其自信力、此孔子之施教垂訓、與其以身人則充實光輝之人格、實爲我中華民族精神上最偉大之基礎也、</p>
<p>孔子者、實踐教育家也、亦政治學家哲學家也、任何一面、皆足發舒其偉大之精神、故孔子之學在在皆可施諸行事、由內而外、推己及人、本末兼賅、體用合一、故其所教者皆爲經世從政之學、所習者皆爲明體達用之道、欲以撥亂反治、由小康而致昇平以躋於太平、故曰「我欲託之空言、不如行事之深切著明也、」此由知而行之義也、其教學者之治學也、由博學而審問、以愼思明辨、至確然無疑乃始歸於篤行、此由學而蘄致於實行也、其修已治人之次序、則由格物以明察事理、致知以研極精蘊、誠意以屏外鶩、正心以端趨向、修身以立人格、此修己之功也、修己之功旣立、而後近之則足以齊家、大之則足以治國、更推而至於平天下、此治人之效也、修己之功不能踐履確實、深造有得、則德不足以服人、才不足以經常而御變、决不能赴治人之效、治人之效不著、則可以證修己之功有所未至、此又本末貫澈之論也、故言智德則主雙修、言知行則主並進、言政教則主一貫、務使人人各磨厲其人格、篤實其踐履、充實其智能、勉務於遠大、爲有體有用之學、極修己治人之功、此其博大精深、實足以啟迪後學於無窮者也、</p>
<p>然孔子之學雖篤實如此、而二千餘年來、因歷代君主捃摘孔子尊王之說、斷章取義、凡有利於鞏固君權者、則力爲表章、引以自重、其他微言大義、則湮沒而不彰、此孔子之學之一厄也、歷代經生徒咕嗶於章句考證及義理空疏之學、埋頭故紙、皓首忘歸、其大別則有漢代註疏之學、宋代性理之學、各自相高、抨擊異派、明淸之際、漢宋學派之爭、門戶分張、壁壘嶄然、各自以爲得孔學之心傳、甚則援佛老之理以演繹經義、談玄習靜、益趨空虛、其實語言文字、决非孔子實踐之義、致虛守靜、尤悖孔子篤行之箴、故談論著述之士愈多、而孔學之眞義愈晦、經常無以肅民彝、處變無以濟國難、其馳鶩事功者遂詆孔學爲空疏無用、而不知章句之儒不足以爲孔學也、此又孔子之學之一厄也、海通以來、歐美政教學術漸被東土、國人震于其富强之實效、則盡窠其所學而學之、於是尤以孔學相詬病、或且創爲漢字可廢、一切綫裝書籍槪可屏棄之言、此又孔子之學之一厄也、詎知孔學之不彰、其責乃在章句迂拘之士習以空虛之說亂孔學之眞、而一國民族性之發舒、必有賴於本國歷史及文化精神之陶镕、乃足以維持民族於不敝、故總理孫先生以天縱之資、深研博稽、盡埽孔學之障翳、昌明絕學、洞澈本原、而後孔子之眞學理、乃得復豁然昭示吾民族於二千數百年後艱危憂患之時、此後紹述微言、重振墜緒、以明體用之實、篤踐履之功、樹弘毅之風、達高明之域、弘濟艱難、撥亂反治、國民宜共勉焉、</p>
<p>（二）孔子之人格觀</p>
<p>孔子之人格、於其修養治學見之、於其教學見之、於其任事見之、其自叙修養治學也、則自十有五志於學起、以至於七十而從心所欲、不踰矩、此數十年中無時不黽勉自修也、故其自稱曰、「其爲人也、發憤忘食、樂以忘憂、不知老之將至、」又曰、「學而不厭、」此證其治學之樂而有以自得也、其施教也、則「誨人不倦」則「有教無類」、則「循循然、善誘人、」又慮施教太易、而學者掉以輕心也、則又待之以「不憤不啟、不悱不發、舉一隅不以三隅反、則不復」之道、俾學者能刻己自修、深造自得也、其勵學者以黽勉不懈也、則有如告子貢以生無所息之義（孔子天瑞篇）、又深戒及門以「謀道不謀食、憂道不憂貧」、與「不患無位、患所以立」、與夫「懷居」及「恥惡衣惡食」之非、皆深切著明、鞭辟入裏之論也、其自任之重、自信之勇、則有如自述「苟有用我者、期月而已可也、三年有成」之言、及相魯三月、而致「男女行者別於塗、道不拾遺、男尙忠信、女尙貞順、四方客至如歸」之實效、以及會夾谷則禮服雄齊、墮三都而强藩勢沮、此皆蹇蹇匪躬、正色立朝、故能影響所被、豪强自摧、異於坐言而不能起行者矣、且其設施次弟、必在忠恕以盡己、躬行以及物、故「立己以立人、達己而達人、」雖處盤根錯節之會、羣小交沮之時、猶挾「知其不可爲而爲之」之精神、以自任天下之重、此又豈後世章句之士所得仰望其萬一者耶、</p>
<p>夫孔子篤實光輝之人格、旣由其博通廣大之學力所造成、而孔子之學所由成、乃在其能廣求師友、博訪周諏、故子貢稱之曰「夫子焉不學、而亦何常師之友、」言孔子之學無常師也、故問禮則於老聃剡子、問樂則於萇弘（禮記樂記）、學琴則於師襄子（韓詩外傳）、從魯太史得周易春秋、與左邱明如周觀百二國寶書、其所學蓋極博矣、其在師友之間者、則有如史記所稱、「所巖事於周則老子、於衛蘧伯玉、於齊晏平仲、於楚老萊子、於鄭子產、於魯孟公綽、數稱臧文仲、柳下惠、銅鍉伯華、介山子、然孔子皆後之、不並世、」觀摩旣廣、故能發皇大誼、纂輯羣言、而及門七十二賢又皆一時才雋之士、各奮所學、以崇閎師教、推衍益廣、此所以與孔子同時者、雖百家爭鳴、而易代以後、多歸銷沉、惟孔子之學日益光大、譬水彙萬派而爲海、所取者博、所成者大、非同淺水細流、不崇朝而立涸也、</p>
<p>故欲法孔子之人格者、履效其終身好學、孳孳不息焉、必效其誨人不倦、有教無類焉、必效其體用兼資、舉行一貫焉、必效其自任天下之重、知其不可爲而爲之焉、必效其振飭紀綱、掊搫權豪、理折强鄰焉、必效其博訪周諏、廣求師友焉、虛其心以求知、篤其行以任重、斯爲善學者也、</p>
<p>（三）孔子學說與時代精神</p>
<p>孔子學說之精粹、在整理古代學術文化、而發揚廣大之於後、六經言之詳矣、其生平學理、在吾人今日尤應引爲啟發勗勉之資者、則爲其攘夷復仇之大義、民生之理論、博愛之學說也、蓋內諸夏而外夷狄、爲中國向來民族精神之所存、春秋之筆、則非特貶夷狄而已、即本屬炎黃之胄、而有夷狄之行者亦夷狄之、其非我族類者、尤在屏絕之列、故管仲佐齊之勳、儒家或薄之爲雜覇、然孔子則進之曰、管仲一匡天下、民到於今受其賜、微管仲、吾其被髪左袵矣、而許之爲仁、春秋紀齊人救刑、左氏傳則稱之曰、戎狄豺狼、不可厭也、諸夏親暱、不可棄也、此其釋攘夷之義、蓋能推勘孔子之教者矣、其後胡安國生當宋季、北虜侵凌、國幾不國、因著春秋傳以伸其攘夷復仇之義、此皆能承孔子春秋之教、以發揮民族大義、引伸攘夷之至訓者也、至復仇之義、則雖以齊襄公之不德、春秋猶賢其能復九世之仇、而諱其滅紀之責、公羊氏引伸其說、以爲復仇雖百世可也、此所謂復國仇之義也、宋之盛亦曰、「仇之當報與否、不專在年遠代易、而以所仇之淺深爲斷、若人滅我國土、絕我宗祀、我突棄神人共痛之、雖百世在所必報、如宋之於金是也、」彭家屏亦曰、「曲禮父之仇弗與共戴天、檀弓孔子答子夏問居父母之仇、則告之以弗與共天下、遇諸市朝不反兵而鬥、」此亦引伸復仇之義也、至其「行己有恥」與「國恥足以興之」之訓、尤足以大張明恥之義、而爲有志復國仇者所不可不三復致意也、故吾人能時時以孔子攘夷復仇之大義自勉、則任何强敵外患加我以侵陵、吾民族必能萬衆一心、不屈不撓、奮志畢力以共復國仇、此實民族精神之神髓、而數千年來志士仁人所以前仆後繼、斷頭裂胸以衛國保種、譬九死而不悔者、皆此精神爲之鼓舞於其間、而中華民族欲求生息於大地之上者、必在以孔子攘夷復仇之大義、旦旦申儆、父詔其子、兄誡其弟、夫勉其婦、長誥其幼、以發揚此民族之正氣也、</p>
<p>至孔子之重視民生、則如其初仕爲中都宰時、即制爲養生送死之節、（家語）其論語所引二帝三王之政、特舉其所重民食喪祭之辭、食以養生、喪祭以送死、實爲中國民生政治之基礎、而孔子答子貢問政、則以足兵先在足食、其答冉有則以庶富教三事爲經國之大端、其答子張則以因民之所利而利之爲從政之要義、斯皆推勘民生精微之論也、蓋庶富教三義之互相爲用、實爲民族建設之精義所存、民族建設非庶無以厚植其基址、非富無以圓滿其生活、非教無以督促其進展、三義並陳、而民生之政乃充實而無遺義、至因民之所利而利之一語、尤爲爲政之本、蓋民之所欲必從之、民之所惡必去之、則民得各遂其生、而平治之基乃立、現代政治最高之原則蓋不外是、爲治者又何可不身體而篤行之也、</p>
<p>孔子博愛之義、在仁恕二字已發揮無遺、蓋仁者愛人、愛人必思所以利人、思所以愛人則必能同民之好惡、思所以利人、則必能民之所好好之、民之所惡惡之、推斯義也、人與人必能盡互助之實、爲政者必能盡愛民之誠、人有疾苦、若己有之、利害所在、無別人我、此所謂泛愛衆也、亦即博愛本義也、至恕之爲義、在於推己及人、故己思安則斷不忍置人於危、己思樂則斷不忍迫人於苦、己思避害則斷不能以害加之於人、己思趨利則斷不能以利盡壟斷之於己、由是更推而至於老吾老以及人之老、幼吾幼以及人之幼、以及孟子所謂好貨好色皆宜與百姓同之、即無害於仁政、好勇宜力避匹夫之勇、而求爲勝殘去殺誅暴安良之大勇、伊尹之一夫一婦不被其澤、若己推而納之害穫陷阱之中、更推而至於民有飢若己飢之、民有溺若己溺之之精神、皆足爲孔子博愛之義發揮者也、仁與恕應互相爲用、非仁則不能恕、非恕則仁之效不能盡、仁而能恕、博愛之義乃圓滿而無憾、且恕之涵義、非徒止所謂己所不欲勿施於人而已、亦宜擴充之爲己之所欲施於人、如是則推己及人互利共助之義益顯、而禮運大同之義自彰、孔子博愛之精理乃周浹而無遺憾矣、</p>
<p>（四）孔子學說與中國文化之將</p>
<p>來</p>
<p>由上述諸義、吾人旣曉然於孔子學說所以爲博大精深之處、及其切於現代民族努力之蘄向、則知决非如浮薄之徒束書不觀者所想像、以爲孔子之學完全爲反乎現代者、而應一切唾棄之也、則此後吾民族苟欲奮其困勉之功、以爭生存、以重光故物、昭我民族歷史之光者、必宜有揅治孔子學說之必要、蓋一切民族能獨立生息於大地者、必有其民族之歷史與文化、由此而增其民族之自信力與其奮鬥之勇氣、由是而發揚光大其固有之文化、則其民族之進展將無限、蓋任何民族雖不能不力追時代之文化、以求適乎時、然時代之文化必以歷史之文化爲基礎、時代之精神亦必以歷史之精神爲基礎、不然則若無源之水、無根之木、决不能爲基本之發展也、故此後中國之時代文化無論若何力追上游要不能不以集往古歷史文化之大成之孔子學說爲新文化之基礎、今日者、寇深矣、欲發揮民族衛國之神勇、必在發揮吾固有之民族精神、而民族精神之動力、必在於民族固有之歷史文化、與其歷史上之模範人物、則舍孔子其誰與歸、則舍孔子人格之模型其誰與歸、而綜孔子學說之適於時代精神者、爲政則應發揮其剛毅之責任心與仁民愛物厚利民生之要義、禦侮則應發揮其攘夷復仇明恥之精神、</p>

<h3 id="c70">紀念孔子 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>第一百二十三次中央常會决議。以今日爲紀念孔子誕辰之「國定紀念日。」吾人於此。不無感想。試一申述焉。</p>
<p>構成民族之主要因素。除共同之言語文字外。當推共同之歷史矣。而歷史之中。最能使人深印腦際縈迴不忘者。又無過於歷史中之偉大人格與其言行。英人常以有一莎士比亞而誇耀於世。德人亦以有康德等人而自詡爲文化最高之民族。其意非謂超等人格。眞能空前絕後。震爍千古。實欲以民族過去之偉大。喚起其今後之自信力。使之繼往開來。以競存於今日之世界耳。唯其如是。故愛爾蘭合併於英。雖已數百年。然爲保持其獨立之生存計、與開拓未來之國運計。仍力求恢復其固有之文化。表揚其固有之歷史。藉以延續其已斷之歷史情緒。綿延其中絕之民族情感。我國過去文化之燦爛。歷史之悠久。偉大人格之衆多。以與世界任何一國比較。决無遜色。値茲國勢凌夷，外患交迫，民族情感散漫已極之今日。選擇一二歷史上値得崇拜之偉大人格。定期紀念。用以振奮民族頹唐之氣。使之果敢有爲。自爲必要之舉措。而當局之選擇孔子。則似尤有深意存焉。</p>
<p>孔子爲我國歷史上最値得崇拜之偉大人格。此爲無可否認之事實。近時論者。每謂周秦之間。百家並鳴。其間學術驚人而可取者。不在少數。而自漢而後。獨孔子得定於一尊。數千年如一日。其故蓋在孔子學說切合帝皇心理。始爲歷代帝皇所推崇。此之爲說。不爲無因。然謂孔子之受人崇拜。僅在於是。則不僅小視孔子之人格。且使崇拜之者。皆成無意識之盲目人類。其爲說之僞。無可爲諱。</p>
<p>我人以爲孔子之所以受人崇拜。約有數點。（一）在其個人之人格。（二）在其救世之主張。（三）在其「無所苟」之態度。（四）在其關於人生之教訓。孔子個人之人格如何。莫審於其弟子。孔子生當亂世。旣不得志於魯。又不容於衛。復被困於陳蔡之間。浪跡十四年。竟不能行其志。然於此困厄之時。其弟子對於孔子之追隨。絕不少衰。子路且欲隨孔子「乘桴浮於海」。子貢亦謂「夫子之道大。故天下莫能容」。曾無因孔子之不得志。而少减其信仰之誠。非其人格感化之力。曷足以臻此。及孔子卒。弟子皆服喪三年與心喪三年。子貢且築廬獨居於墓上者。凡六年。其餘弟子之遷居墓側者。達百餘家。遂成後世之孔里。凡此事實。皆非根據後世帝皇推尊之一點所得以說明者也。</p>
<p>再則孔子之政治主張。亦爲後世受人崇拜之原因。孔子生時。周室已衰。諸侯相侵。戰禍頻仍。百姓愁苦。孔子其時之政治主張。即在行王道。黜詐力。即於管仲「九合諸侯一匡天下」之所爲。亦有所不然。謂管仲僅能使齊霸。不能使齊王。故推孔子之意。實以中國之統一爲重。苟能統一。則不必重復尊崇國運已微之周室。觀於孔子周游列國。以求用世。可知其志實在使任何一國王天下。並不在於尊周也。故曰「苟有用我者。期月而已可也。三年有成」。孔子之所以成爲「聖之時者也」。其在此乎。孔子所求者。旣爲統一之中國。而其方法則爲不肯「殺一不辜以得天下」之王道。故其言曰。「遠人不服。則修德以來之」。推孔子當日之主張。不獨在求中國之統一。同時更在求中國內戰之廢除。</p>
<p>其三値得我人崇拜者。即孔子雖栖栖皇皇。以求用世。然能行其主張則仕。不能行其主張即退。並無絲毫之留戀。故孔子爲魯相。一至季桓子受齊女樂。荒於政事。即去魯他適。此後周游列國。亦以能行其主張與否爲進退之原則。可見孔子實爲有主張之政治家。而非一僅知謀取富貴之政客。故曰。「不義而富且貴。於我如浮雲」也。</p>
<p>至於人生之修養。古人所重之教訓。無有過於孔子者。可不深論。即此數端以觀。孔子爲中國歷史上最偉大之人格。殊爲明顯。其値得我人崇拜之紀念。亦可不言而喻。然我人不能已於言者。即孔子人格雖偉大。其思想不能不受時代之限制。其最顯然者。即重仁義黜武力之王道政策。行於中國境內。固甚善。唯行於弱肉强食之國際舞臺。則必無效果之可言。此其一。再則孔子之政治理想乃君主之政治。於今日中華民國國體亦不無扞格之虛。此我人於當局紀念孔子之時。不能不特別注意者也。要而言之。任何偉大人格。其思想不能不受時代之限制。故我人之崇拜。須爲有理智之崇拜。不當爲盲目之崇拜。再則我人之崇拜偉大人格之要點。不在一味推崇古人。而在有「見賢思齊」之信心耳。</p>

<p>蠶繭慘跌蠶絲枯萎</p>
<p>農村衰落農民遭殃</p>
<p>－埼玉縣就是一個例子－</p>
<p>日本一般社會所謂的「景氣」、原是一種浮動的「景氣」、對外傾消和軍事工業、都是「打腫臉充胖子」的行爲、於實際的經濟市面、並沒有多大益處、雖然三菱經濟研究所調查日本各重要工業的生產指數、都向上增加、除開生絲工業之外、如棉紗棉布差不多能保持平衡、如煤炭·銑鐵·製鋼·及化學工業等等與軍事有關的工業、總是向上增加、日本的產業資本家、特別是軍閥、頗自誇經濟現狀、不亞於蘇聯、并已超過歐美諸國、所以她一面努力開闢市塲、一面積極備戰、</p>
<p>然而事實所昭示、上面所說的那些樂觀材料、祇屬片面的光明、現在都市上、也不啻到處聽到工作難的歎聲、飢餓的流民、也隨處可以看見、尤其是從今年春繭上市以後、絲價大跌、跌到與一九三二年的價格差不多、而其前途、則比從前更壞、因爲人造絲製造越見精良、漸次要奪取生絲的市塲了、又因美國市面依然不佳、這種偏重於奢侈的物品、自必首先感受打擊、所以日本生絲輸出、遭遇罕見的悲運、</p>
<p>原來日本農村經濟、早就發生問題了、這個問題、就是生產過剩、如米價低落、農民即異常受窘、繭價下跌、使副業收入、也等於零、歷年以來、全日本農村所積欠的債務、總計有七十億元日金之多、自一九三0年以來、即有陷於凍結的狀態、去年雖略有好轉的傾向、但今年的旱災水災、頗爲重大而且普遍、同時還有以下的諸象徵、</p>
<p>（一）今年春繭價格低落、與前年相似、但是前年夏秋繭、却漸恢復舊價、今年的希望、是很少的、</p>
<p>（二）現時米價是相當的漲高了、新米上塲後何如、尙不可逆料、唯一可慮的是今年氣候不良、無論怎樣是會减少收成的、則米價即令上漲、也是得不償失呀、</p>
<p>（三）農村疲敝、是多年積下來的老病、現在根本上不但沒有救助的辦法、臨時的緩和手段、農民還是不堪其苦的、何况現時岡田政府所謂農村對策、是否眞能作有效的實施、是很大的疑問、所比農村景况的惡化、是很可慮的、</p>
<p>上述三種情形、爲日本一般社會所共同承認的危機、并且以爲難免不影響到整個的社會、例如長野一縣農村負債總計、就有二億五千萬元、現在事實上除了延期償還之外、沒有別的方法、但是勸業銀行和其他金融機關、都爲市面頹敗所迫、不能不追索欠欵、這樣局面、眞不容易找到解决的方法、</p>
<p>再如東京府的鄰縣－埼玉縣有名的秩父町、距離約九哩的浦山村、論地方還算是輦轂之下、魚米之鄕、雖其交通不甚方便、在從前原存留着若干原始遺跡的－女權的社會、主婦一言萬金、比男子的「權能」大得多、這是日本國內所不經見的事、然而最近來浦山村二百五十餘戶人家中、全村的處女、祇有三個生病的女人、其餘的都拋棄她們的幸福、離村找苦工去了、因爲村裏實在沒有法子生存、去年收獲的米榖、都賣出了、今年繭子賣來不够本、就沒有錢買米吃、小學兒童多半不能吃飽、一般人沒飯吃、而吃草根的也不在少數、婚姻大禮祗能請兩三位至親、絕無力量招待其他的客人、宴會時除了各喝三盃、聊申祝意之外、再沒有多的酒喝、當地武甲山裏出產木炭、作工的人、每月不過得工資八元、可是要養活一家五六口人、每人每天僅得工資四錢或五錢日金（不及大洋五分）、因比小學校的兒童、也利用暑期休假到山裏去背炭、從山上背到山下、一包木炭僅工資三錢、每天一個小孩、也可以賺得十二錢以至十八錢、其窘狀就可想而知了、這個村從前並不是怎樣的窮村莊、現在却成了如此景象、通日本國內、這樣的地方、不在少數、如此情形、能說不嚴重嗎、（八月二十一日於東京）</p>

<p>＝蘇俄嚴密應付＝</p>

<p>（日軍配備）最近日俄在東北之形勢、日趨緊張、俄方不獨努力作防日之準備、並使共產黨員、下鄕作反日之宣傳、日人則於南滿鐵路沿綫各大站間、興築大量之兵營、及飛機塲等、於公主嶺之街東、更建有大兵營、兵工廠、及行軍司令部、街之北、則興築大飛機塲、爆搫機廠等、工程極形浩大、現有工人數千、正在積極工作中、並傳聞日俄軍事之行動、於東鐵「讓渡」交涉决裂之後、即將爆發、此間殷實之家、及資本較充足之商號、均相率將欵匯往關內、預圖避免戰禍、可見人心動搖之一斑矣日軍在東北布置之兵力、及其軍事配備之近狀、分列如下、（一）在綏芬河及牡丹江、共駐有日軍兩個師團、其行軍之計劃、則以綏芬河作第一道防綫、牡丹江作第二道防綫（二）大黑河及龍門縣、共有日軍四個師團、以大黑河爲第一道防綫、龍門縣爲第二道防綫、（三）滿洲里與海拉爾、共有日軍兩個師團、而其主力軍、似在聲壯龍門、此外對於江防上之配備、如松花江·黑龍江·烏蘇里江、共集有防艦三十餘艘、每艘配有防空之裝置、（如探照燈、高射機關槍、及高射砲等、）同時尙有一艦載有飛機八架、現停泊於哈市之西正陽河、並聞停泊於上海之日艦隊、於九月初旬、即可開回旅大、以充實其在東北之兵力、又日軍對於行軍之交通、尤爲注意、按由旅順經瀋陽·齊齊哈爾·直達大黑河之間、現僅有二百華里之間隔、未能連以鐵路、故於該叚築有極堅固之汽車路以利軍事之行動、日人近更擬由圖門江·經延吉·東密·直達同江·興築一軍事鐵道、不日即可計劃開工、</p>
<p>日軍又在四平街前交通中學地址設飛機塲、駐有日兵百餘、八面城於車站之西方、亦築有兵舍一處、可容二千餘人、現駐日軍約數百名、日軍又於遼源縣車站路西領事館之北方、建有大兵營一座、可容三千餘人、現駐日軍約四百餘名、站東有飛機塲一處、可以降落上油、開通縣築有兵營一處、可容五百人、洮南縣駐有日騎兵第四旅團、並飛機一隊、近更將該城內高處民房收買、建築大兵營一廬、可容數千人、此處最爲重要、日本駐軍較多、白城子位於洮南北方、爲洮索路之起點、日人於此處築有可容一師團之大兵營及大飛機塲各一所、此處形勢、對於外蒙與「北滿」之聯絡、均甚險要、故日人在此之軍事布置、頗爲完善、日人對於此地居民、監視最嚴、若有往來信件、必受日方的縝密調查、住戶恒被日本憲兵及僞方警察之搜查、居民亦有被押或遭殘害之危險、因是遼北民衆、異常激昂、率多加入義勇軍之工作、</p>
<p>（俄方準備）蘇俄因鑑於日人之急於備戰、故其在遠東、亦努力充實防禦之配備、據最近可靠之情報、蘇俄在大黑河方面、已集有十五萬兵力、綏芬河以西、約有精旅五萬人、並有華韓義勇軍七萬餘人、在滿洲里方面、共有紅軍十萬人、由滿洲里至綏芬河間、築有堅固之工事、每日均有俄國飛機百餘架、在東北邊際上空演習、又哈爾濱以東之義勇軍、亦十有六七、受俄方經濟之援助、及少數之新式武器、其中最强有力者、即爲趙尙志、刻在濱縣、頗得民衆之資援、此外、下江及哈綏沿綫一帶、亦時有同類之義勇軍出現、據上述之情形、蘇俄不獨自身已配有充實之兵力、同時尙有多數華韓義勇軍爲之恊助、是日本雖積極圖謀進攻蘇俄、然似亦有顧慮也、</p>
<p>據某方情報、蘇俄爲準備對日開戰、擾亂日軍後方、遂由中·俄·韓·勞動者、編成所謂敢死隊、派赴滿洲各地、現已任命利切歐爲指揮官、編成敢死隊、聞蘇俄對敢死隊先施以六個月之暗殺炸彈使用法等訓練、然後再派赴滿洲從事活動、</p>

<p>巴達維亞特約訊、日荷會議、因荷印實施陶瓷器限制律、瀕於破裂、此事因雙方仍在佈置陣容、冀作最後之掙扎、故至今尙無重大之發展、目下除日本駐荷公使武富、與荷蘭外交大臣德格拉夫、正在交涉外、日廣田外相、亦正與荷蘭駐日公使巴布斯折衝、故結果如何、尙難逆料、惟荷印全體日僑、則對此已不勝其憤激、日文報對荷印政府此舉、攻擊甚烈、稱爲「暴行」與「壓迫」、日本出席日荷會議代表、亦已抱定宗旨、若荷方不撤銷此限制律、日荷會議除决裂外、別無他種途徑可尋、至於荷印日商方面、亦已團結一致、據聞其目的，乃爲激勵日本政府及日本代表、對抗荷印政府之措置、最近爪哇日商七大實業團體、曾發表一聲明書、文云、爪哇陶瓷器輸入商組合、由日商發起、華商欣然參加、四大荷商原已承認加入、及日荷會議開始時、卽推翻前約、突然宣稱、拒絕參加、荷印政府以安定市塲謀日荷兩國共存共榮、及此輸入商組合爲口實、發表該項商品之輸入限制令、此實曲解民間恊力、不僅如此、此項限令之發表、實爲此後荷印五十六種商品限制令全部實施之先導、故日荷會議之能否成功、須視此次限制令之能否撤消爲斷、（中略）今日本政府正盡力、於此限制令之撤消、我等爲聲援政府之措置、及促進日本陶磁器輸出組合聯合會解决此案計、故主張禁止對爪哇輸出、以促荷印方面之反省、此爲必要之急務、並盼望其能採取我等之意見、署名者爲全爪哇日本人雜貨輸入組合聯盟、全爪哇日本人小賣組合聯盟、泗水實業恊會、巴城商業恊會、三寳壟商業恊會、萬隆實業恊會、爪哇陶瓷器輸入商組合等團體、</p>
<p>巴城日人商業恊會、以荷印政府對日採取高壓手段、曾召集會議、其决議案之要點如下、荷印政府此項限制令、非僅單爲陶瓷器一問題、蓋此次限制令若不撤消、則今後其他各種限制、亦必相繼實施、故此事必須力爭、</p>
<p>同時泗水日人實業恊會、亦决定取同樣之態度、曾通電日本工商大臣、措辭頗爲强硬、電文大要如下、荷印政府排斥日貨之企圖、關於排貨令之撤銷、我等信賴全權代表、以期待其成果、現時荷印政府突然對陶瓷器之輸入、再發表差別之法令、對於暴戾法令之卽時撤銷、我等相信、全權代表必出之以緊急之處置、我等爲擁護日商之權利起見、不惜犧牲一切、决定停止營業、深望日本國內之商人、在此限制律求撤消前、立卽停止輸出、此事之結果如何、卽爲將來對各種商品之試金石、萬一此次團結失敗、則必爲荷印方面所乘、茲後欲擁護日商之權利、必難成功、我人觀於上述兩地日商之態度、日本對於此次荷印政府所頒佈之陶瓷器限制律、其反對之激烈、可見一斑、但其反對之武器、乃爲「禁運」與「不賣」兩種、此種辦、</p>
<p>法、能否使荷方屈服、日商雖有此自信、以吾人視之、恐難樂觀、蓋輸入荷印之陶磁器、不僅日本一國、荷印日商卽能禁止其本國陶磁器輸入荷印、安能禁止他國陶磁器之進口耶、</p>

<p>（貨物聯運）日就發展、沿綫各站積存待運貨物、達六萬餘噸、前爲疏運積貨計、曾令輪渡增添員工、加班行駛、但其第三步必須增加過江車輛、方見成效、考目前能適合於聯運過江條件之貨車車輛、在津浦僅有二百輛左右、在京滬僅有一百三十餘輛、故逐日過江之貨物、由北至南、最多時不過二千四百餘噸、由南至北者更不過數百噸、運輸能力有限、其他多數貨車、至京滬均因彈簧力弱、車鈎低洛、在津浦因缺乏風閘、多失修理、致不合過江條件、坐使聯運貨物、在站山積、皆無法儎運、輪渡過江效力如何擴大、乃過江車輛有限、亦屬徒然、特令該兩路局、迅將貨車車輛、</p>

<p>－答談夢若君－</p>
<p>談君讀過我們的「釋實踐」以後，來信問：什麼是實用主義？實用主義和實踐是很容易混駁的，所以談君發生了疑惑。</p>
<p>實用主義，正如字面所示，是把實用的效果看得很重要的。凡是有用處的東西，就是好東西。凡是有用處的言論，也就是眞理。如果推廣一步，這就成爲功利主義，一切都以利益和功效來衡量，而不問其他，這種主義，我們也不能說它完全沒有理由。人旣然都要生活，那就不能不顧到生活上的利益，倘若我的生活逼迫着我每天要打算盤，而我自己不肯這樣幹，不是就要餓死嗎？連人都餓死了，還能顧到其他麼？</p>
<p>但我們要注意，實用主義是把應用的效果</p>
<p>看得太重要了，太誇大了，萬事都以實用來衡量，而抹煞了一切的理論和眞理。世界有不少專門講求實際的人，他們說做事要切實，一切理論在他們都認爲是空論，「空論無補於實際」，這話也是不錯的，但是因爲反對空論，即連一切合理的科學的理論也抹殺了，那就是很大的錯誤。因爲，如果我們是打主意馬馬虎虎，得過且過地混日子，那當然用不着什麼理論，如果我們要將眼光放得遠大一點，要使我們的生活更前進一點，要使我們的行動能走向更正確的道路時，沒有理論的指導是不行的。</p>
<p>以讀書爲例，如果我們完全站在實用的目的上來看，那麼鴛鴦蝴蝶派的小說能供我們消遣，也當然有實用的價値的，笑林廣記能使我們在勞苦的工作之後開顏一笑，也是很實用的</p>
<p>。這些東西，能在我們的精神上起一種暫時的麻痺作用，使我們忘却了生活的痛苦，不是也很好的麼？然而，這些東西的實用的效果，只是在於能够蒙蔽我們的眼睛，使我們看不見自己周圍的苦痛的現實，使我們生活沒有目的，使我們頹廢。如果我們要明白自己的周圍的社會，要决定一個正確的努力的方針，這些東西對於我們仍一點用處也沒有。在這種時候，我們除了研究科學的理論以外，是不會得到什麼結果的。</p>
<p>因此，完全否認了理論的實用主義，它的「實用」的效果只限於敷衍目前，並不能發生更進一步的功效。我們只要把眼光稍稍放大一點，就知道這種偏狹的實用觀念發後仍是無用！</p>
<p>如果我們不僅僅是聽天由命地鬼混日子，如果我們是要奮鬥，要前進的話，我們就必須先認識淸楚自己的周圍，然後才可以找到正確的道路。對於這複雜的社會，若沒有理論的帮助，是認識不淸楚的。理論能帮助我們認識，這就是理論的用處。所以實用主義者所輕視的理論，實際上正是比實用主義的本身更極實用的東西。</p>
<p>所以，偏狹的實用主義是要不得的。但現在又要注意一點，就是，我們雖然反對偏狹的實用主義，但也不能把理論看成萬能的東西。「空談理論無補於實際」這句話也不能不記住，單只書本上的理論，還是一點用處也沒有。書本上的理論只足以供參考，作爲我們生活行動上的一種帮助而已，我們還要把書本上的東西拿到實際生活中去檢證，在生活中有時可以發現比書本上更豐富的東西。並且我們還要記住，一切書本上的理論，原來就是從很多人的實際生活和實際研究中得來的，實際生活才是眞正的活的理論的根源。</p>
<p>一方面要利用理論以指導生活，一方面要用生活去矯正理論，並在生活中發現新理論，這就是實踐，實踐是「實用主義」與「理論」的統一。實用主義不是實踐，空空的理論也不是實踐。</p>

<p>— 頣</p>
<p>世界上人有種種，有白人，有黑人，有黃種人。黃種古代之自尊，是以爲除了自己是人外，其餘的種族皆是走獸。「總理各國事務衙門」的翻譯官，是不把其餘的種族當人看的，狒蘭西，英狤猁諸尊號，便是明證。</p>
<p>現在知道自己們以外世上也還有旁的人了，但同一社會里面，又有闊人，窮人，要人，偉人之分。同是人類，也還分別男人，女人。</p>
<p>這好像向小孩談話，艱深　晦澀之嫌該沒有了。但普通人口頭有一句惡語，曰「不近人情」。這人情是應該指那種人情呢？</p>
<p>時常沐浴，換上干凈衣裳，總該是人情了吧，但倘若這人是窮苦人，則乖張，奢費：倘若這是闊人，則是人情。在美國每日工作八小時，是平常，在中國（倘若是一位少爺或老爺），每日規定工作若干小時，是不近人情了。－－大槪凡歐化，維新，不與常人同流者，皆用這句話包括。而這糢糢糊糊的標準，是隨說者的妄念而定的。</p>
<p>嵇叔夜曾經喜歡打鐵，好像不近人情了，但宗室不近人情之處，是風雅，如有惡行，普通人也不敢反對他，倘若是平民則也許早遇到一頓飽打了。六朝有人還喜歡加人白眼，可算乖癖之至了吧，但也不敢反對他。可見卽算輿論公認爲壞蛋，不近人情之類，又因其地位階級之類而有顧忌或諱言的。</p>
<p>反之，凡老奸巨猾，必盡人情之極致，相傳歷代的奸臣，大都藹然可親。王莽竟是謙恭下士。只有傻子想改革社會者流，才肯負時謗，任勞苦，如王荊公者，又早蒙這四字的惡駡了。</p>
<p>凡抱定宗旨做事，實在可以不管烏烟瘴氣的批評，徇人情之處多，苟非另有衷腸，則竟是痴漢，一定的。</p>
<h3 id="c169">馬來農村小景（下） <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>每天黃昏「阿答」厝角便會聚集了成堆的乾柴枯葉，燃起火來讓屋里薰得人氣都透不過。蚊羣固然被薰走了，屋脚便尿的臭氣也會减少牠的味量，而屋主人便訓練成爲一個受慣火薰的動物了。</p>
<p>一到村子裏有着婚喪等大事的時候，羊皮鼓便有了更大的用處。那時會有長大的行列通過街頭，教士們誦着經咒，婦女們罩上艷麗的頭巾，遮住臉孔。在黃昏，婚喪之家便有鷄羊薄洒享客，而親族朋友們便會爲主人服務，教士們誦經直至夜半。</p>
<p>在「禁食節」前後，村子裏便會熱哄哄地宰牛和殺羊。村人們更會忙碌地敲下椰子和檳榔來，向市塲換來過節的品物。於是日裏村落間便止熄了火烟，而黑夜間一間間的「阿答」厝前便會燃起了巨大的火燄。一陣歡樂泛濫了全農村，而平和的鄕村空氣便會被打破。</p>
<p>當「不景」的狂濤從都市深侵入農村的時候，靜穆的農村便起了波動。捐稅是勒迫不出來了，士兵們便荷着槍大踏步到了農村。高等的馬來人固然仍會悠閒自得，而下級的平民們便應受着蹂躪。自遠祖以來的平和的馬來農村現在是被威脅了，歷史竟會變化得人間的顏色！</p>
<p>而今的馬來農村是攪起了波紋了，像平靜的水面被投上了石子一樣。待將來的老人們和教士們不能安靜地在傍晚時候虔誠地跪向西方，向他們的聖主謨罕默德的靈地頂禮膜拜的時候，怕馬來的農村景色又會起着劇烈的變化了！</p>
<h3 id="c170">女首領 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 向愚</p>
<p>在燃着松明子的火炬之下，一個人突地倒了下去，痛苦的尖音，和着鮮紅的熱血，一齊迸發出來。</p>
<p>「好手法！」</p>
<p>屋子裏站着圍觀的人，狼似地呌了起來，讚美着。</p>
<p>另一個人收起了染紫的刀，傲岸地看了一下死者之後，便走到女首領的面前，低聲說道：</p>
<p>「現在是我勝利了！」</p>
<p>一面仰起黑布纏着的腦袋，揚着得意的眼色，彷彿在說：請履踐你的話吧。</p>
<p>女首領睜着美麗的很大的眼睛，將伸在胸前的二指頭，决然地向外一劃，靜靜地說道：</p>
<p>「我還是不能愛你的。」</p>
<p>「爲甚麼？」</p>
<p>得勝了的男子，失聲地呌了起來，臉上立刻換上了痛苦的顏色。同時滴着血的刀也忽然墜到散着鷄骨鹿骨的地上去了。</p>
<p>「因爲你受傷了」，女首領順手把桌上殘餘的半碗酒，拿來一口飲下，繼續說下去，帶着强烈的熱情，「我要－－我要－－天呵，我要愛一個最勇敢的人，他是永遠都不會受傷的！」</p>
<p>頹喪着的男子，登時看見他流血的左腕了，是對方倒下去的那一刻暗中砍中了的便忍着一下子才覺出來的疼痛，慘然地說道：</p>
<p>「但我是爲你才受的傷呵。」</p>
<p>「但你並不是爲了要保護我！」</p>
<p>女首領掉轉身去，對着掛有長春藤的窗口，向黑夜籠罩着的山谷，深深地吸了一口氣。漫延在羣山之上的松林，起着洪大的濤聲，由遠而近，荷荷地響了過來。</p>
<p>痛苦着的男子，臉色灰白了，發出顫抖的聲音哀求：</p>
<p>「那末，只請你用你的手，替我的傷口纏上布吧！」</p>
<p>女首領沒有開腔，僅用兩個指頭理理給山風吹亂了的頭髪，眼睛是仍舊望着睡在窗外的暗夜。</p>
<p>「連這一點子的憐憫，你都不給嗎？」</p>
<p>女首領依然背着身子立着，冷冷地說道：</p>
<p>「沒有憐憫的人，是不配受人的憐憫的。」</p>
<p>「難道我沒有憐憫嗎？」</p>
<p>「你有憐憫？」女首領突然轉過來，指着浸在血裏的屍身，斬釘切鐵那麼似地說，「他是怎麼死的，不還是你的弟兄嗎？」</p>
<p>「我是傻子呵，傻子呵！」</p>
<p>哀求着的男子將刀往頸一抹，頹然倒下地去，迸出哀沉的呌聲。</p>
<p>女首領揚一揚劍也似的眉峯，閃着可怕的眼光，同時却又是嫵媚地向着衆人說道：</p>
<p>「誰也不能單獨佔有我的！我要做你們大家的愛人，因爲你們大家合起來才是人世間最勇敢的！」</p>
<p>爲這事變所驚獃的弟兄們，到這時才趕忙應諾道</p>
<p>「首領的話是對的！」</p>
<p>同時各人的心上，都浮起了這樣的意思。</p>
<p>「你眞醉得一蹋糊塗了！」</p>
<p>然而，無論如何，大家是很高興的。隨卽尾着她登上馬，走了出去。</p>
<p>黑夜的山中，立刻揚起了馬賊的歌聲，但不久便被松濤捲沒了。於是，樹皮蓋屋的山中客店，彷彿被棄了那麼似的，孤寂地蹲伏在危崖的下邊。</p>

<p>— 華圉</p>
<p>（三）字是怎麼來的？</p>
<p>照「易經」說，書契之前明明是結繩；我們那里的鄕下人，碰到明天要做一件緊要事，怕得忘記時，也常常說：「褲帶上打一個結！」那麼，我們的古聖人，是否也用一條長繩，有一件事就打一個結呢？恐怕是不行的。只有幾個結還記得，一多可就糟了。或者那正是伏羲皇上的「八卦」之流，三條繩一組，都不打結是「乾」，中間各打一結是「坤」罷？恐怕也不對。八組尙可，六十四組就難記，何况還會有五百十二組呢。只有在秘魯還有存留的「打結字「（Quippug）,用一條橫繩，掛上許多直繩，拉來拉去的結起來，網不像網，倒似乎還可以表現較多的意思。我們上古的結繩，恐怕也是如此的罷。但牠旣然被書契掉換，又不是書契的祖宗，我們也不妨暫且不去管牠了。</p>
<p>夏禹的「岣嶁碑」是道士們假造的；現在我們能在實物上看見的最古的文字，只有商朝的甲骨和鐘鼎文。但這些，都已經很進步了，幾乎找不出一個原始形態。只在銅器上，有時還可以看見一點寫實的圖形，如鹿，如象，而從這圖形上，又能發見和文字相關的線索：中國文字的基礎是「象形」。</p>
<p>畫在西班牙的亞勒泰米拉（Altamira）洞裏的野牛，是有名的原始人的遺迹，許多藝術史家說，這正是「爲藝術的藝術」，原始人畫着玩玩的。但這解乏未免過於「摩登」，因爲原始人沒有十九世紀的文藝家那麼有閒，他的畫一隻牛，是有緣故的，爲的是關於野牛，或者是獵取野牛，禁咒野牛的事。現在上海墻壁上的香烟和電影的廣告畫，尙且常有人張着嘴巴看，在少見多怪的原始社會裏，有了這麼一個奇蹟，那轟動一時，就可想而知了。他們一面看，知道了野牛這東西，原來可以用線條移在別的平面上，同時彷彿也認識了一個「牛」字一面也佩服這作者的才能，但沒有人請他作自傳賺錢，所以姓氏也就湮沒了。但在社會裏，倉頡也不止一個，有的在刀柄上刻一點圖，有的在門戶上畫一些畫，心心相印，口口相傳，文字就多起來，史官一採集，便可以敷衍記事了。中國文字的由來，恐怕也逃不出這例子的。</p>
<p>自然，後來還該有不斷的增補，這是史官自己可以辦到的，新字夾在熟字中，又是象形，別人也容易推測到那字的意義。直到現在，中國還在生出新字來。但是，硬做新倉頡，却要失敗的，吳的朱育，唐的武則天，都曾經造過古怪字，也都白費力。現在最會造字的是中國化學家，許多原質和化合物的名目，很不容易認得，連音也難以讀出來了。老實說，我是一看見就頭痛的，覺得遠不如就用萬國通用的拉丁名來得爽快，如果二十來個字母都認不得，請恕我直說：那麼，化學也大抵學不好的。</p>

<p>呵，弟弟，他離開這萬惡的世界已經一年多了呵！他的死，究竟是他的幸福，還是他的不幸？這可「說不淸」；然而這對於我－只要在百忙中有些兒的閒暇，或者在深更夜靜一個人睜着眼睛躺在床上的時候，他的那種天眞的面孔便要闖進我的腦子裏來，彷彿在耳邊上聽見了一聲「哥哥」，一剎間，那種血肉糢糊的尸身就好像擺在眼前來了。呵，我痛苦，我憤恨，我抓着我亂蓬蓬的頭髪，我揑着我瘦筋筋的拳頭，－－呵，他死了！</p>
<p>弟弟在小孩子的時候，很頑皮，他從來就好像不覺得他應該讀書似的。爸死的時候，他才三歲，家境困難，他當然不知道，這以後，每逢新年過完，聽見媽打算的全是我的事情，他還只會着睜着一雙天眞的大眼睛，好像聽人家說着不相干的海外故事似的，－－其實他那時已經快要十歲，是該讀書的時候了。</p>
<p>媽是很能幹的：她雖然吐了血，還是要硬着頭皮反抗那些伯叔們投來的欺侮；他承繼着爸留下來的一間小商店，挺着腰在一般親友們的面前硬把塲面撑持；…………這些，都是爲了我們呵！她的哲學是：請兒子們將來給她爭口氣吧！她就這樣地活下來了。每年總是到年頭就得到各處去爲我們張羅讀書費；不，應該說是爲了我一個。借錢是那麼艱難呵！她每次在輕蔑的眼光底下走出人家櫃房的時候，心裏只能這麼想：先把大的一個「盤」出來吧。然而弟弟也就這麼被丟在一邊了。</p>
<p>弟弟有一身粗獷的皮肉。臉跟手都在太陽下晒得通紅。矮矮地，然而氣奪奪地，一見着人總是睜大着他那大大的黑眼睛。我每天下午放學回家，很少看見他，直到晚上，媽替我點着豆大火光的菜油燈，督着我溫讀夜的時候，他才鼻靑眼腫地跳着回來，有時候，臉上還帶着一條條的抓傷。當然，媽又要扭着他的耳朶拉在條凳上打屁股了。板子還沒碰到肉，他就先要啊喲啊喲地亂嚷起來；等到打完了，一股幽怨而又不在乎的情緒又閃上他那黑紅的臉龐。這樣子，終於使媽用袖頭蒙着眼睛哭了。</p>

<p>（精彩百出）　四將打來、各有特色、形勢緊張、爲從來罕見、邱飛海一如往昔、林寳華特別努力、發球或用硬力、或用扭轉之弧性球、建功不少、美麗之射擊、每使對手束手無策、惟二人本年係初次合作、聯絡上猶未盡善盡美、德孚網上力劈、爲四人之冠、發球重如砲彈、朋尼費區之網前雙手執拍、向斜側輕撥、博得掌聲不少、觀者咸稱之爲「殺手鐧」、甚爲切當、</p>
<p>（苦於應付）開賽後、大刀闊斧、球拍碰碰作嚮、力道甚足、英先以三比一佔優、德孚發球、兩次雙失誤、復又兩次高壓、送入網中、中華追上一局、林之發球局竟失敗、形勢益爲垂危、對手身體高大、頻施高壓、林邱苦於應付、以二比五落後、邱得發局後、德孚三殺出界、中華得連加二局、成四比五、頗有後來居上之勢、且下局林寳華發球、又以三比一分佔先、祗須再勝一球、即可成五比五、安知事與願違、邱連失三記、林殺球出界、以四比六負、</p>
<p>（酣鬥獲勝）第二盤、有更劇烈之鬥爭、朋尼費區先發球、負光局、邱飛海亦失發球局、德孚以三次猛力發球、得以二比一佔先、中華以四比一分成二比二局、後成三比三、三比四、中華落後、林寳華之發球局、以滑四成四比四局、又各加一局、成五比五、而六比六、均爲英國先勝、我國追隨之、當十二局上、林邱網前之左右擘擊、刁滑巧妙、嘆爲奇觀、於是精神一振、球勢隨之而轉、先奪朋尼費區之發球局、下局我國先勝三記、連負三記、賴林之兩次高壓成功、以八比六轉敗爲勝、</p>
<p>（扶搖直上）第三盤、德孚先發球、最初四局、各以發球獲勝、成二比二、以後對於自殺甚多、林邱鋒芒益盛、得心應手、左右逢源、連獲四局、以六比二勝、費時極短、中華反以二比一盤佔優勢、</p>
<p>（最後决戰）下盤又陷於苦戰狀况中、且每局必有久長之競爭、又爲德孚先發球、而發球者又必勝是局、挨次輪流、直至五比五、朋尼區之發球局、突然失手、中華遂以六比五導前、不意邱飛海之發局、亦告失利、又成六比六、時天色將晚、觀衆獨球興未闌、拍手呌好不止、局勢愈益緊張、爲愼重起見、觀者不准在塲邊行動、更不許嘩噪、全塲肅靜、沈嗣良並主張換新球、决最後雌雄、時輪値對手朋尼費巨發球、斯時換新球、頗屬不當、因於中華不利、但因屬主隊、林邱祇有俯允、乃格外小心、林格外努力、對手緊守網前、林上巧妙之高球、擾亂對手戰策、果以四比一奪得是局、邱發球、又以四比一完成、結果遂以九比七勝、</p>

<h3 id="c199">醫事建設方略（下） <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>（癸）聯合各派大團結　醫派之說。紛紜一時。凡吾同道。類皆知之。至團結之說。言者屢矣。顧至今未能實現者。則以各派意見。未能盡趨一致故也。未必萬億一心。則力量集中而成事易。非然者。則是此非彼。入主出奴。發言盈庭而莫衷一是。一事之舉行。輒難免於異派之反對。不將左右製肘耶。故欲醫界有巨大之力量。新醫之發展。非融合各派作大團結不可也。</p>
<p>（子）取締不良份子　無論何種團體。其份子皆難免於良莠不齊。其良者固勞其心力以謀團體之幸福矣。其不良者。則以妒賢害能之心理。以求達其爭權奪利之企圖。一有不遂。則不惜出其搗亂之手段。以從事於破壞。故此種份子不除。則團體事業。殊難有成功之希望。吾人惟有集中力量。從事於實地之檢舉。苟有發覺此種陰謀之人物。或假借團體名義以在外招搖者。皆當處置之。驅除之。如是則內部肅淸。而不至爲害羣之馬之所累矣。</p>
<p>（丑）研究醫業保障方法　醫有應具之道德。亦有應享之利權。顧所謂醫權云者。有其特殊之立塲。爲普通人權所不能包括者焉。普通法律對於傷害威嚇以及使用麻醉毒品等等。皆須科以重罰。獨醫家則以業務之關係。對於上說諸項。絕無避免之可能。故醫者爲之。則决非犯法。雖然。此種現象。在醫家雖有特殊之地位。而在法律則尙無規定之明文於是醫家乃日處於犯法之中而無切實之保障矣。年來醫病糾紛。日甚一日。醫家治病。動輒見於公庭。若再不設法保障。則一尸體之解剖。一手術之施行。一藥針之注射。一言語之權變。皆有爲人告發之餘地。吾人固當一面督促政府速行頒布醫師之保護法。一面尤當以團體之立塲。參照歐西各國之成規。證以吾國之民情風俗。切實研究醫業之保障方法。以爲政府之參考。如此則醫業有藩維之可言。而不致時受無辜之侵害也。</p>
<p>（寅）限制非正式醫師之產生　蠹生於木而木毀。江湖之醫生於醫而醫毀。此吾人數年以來。對於非正式之醫生所以嚴辭闢之也。嘗考其產生之原因。有由於醫院之護士。有由於私人之學徒。有由於函授之醫校。有由於設備不完之醫校。凡此種種。皆爲產生非正式醫師之源泉。而其責當由正式醫師負之也。夫欲求一事業之發揚。必先從事於內部之整頓。欲求一病害之驅除。必先從事於根株之斷絕。苟能以團體之力量。對於固有之非正式醫生。施以相當之訓練。對於未來之非正式醫師。杜其繼續之產生。則舊者漸趨减少之後。中國之醫界自能歸於純潔矣。</p>
<p>綜上所言。爲十三項。雖爲老生之常談。而實醫事建議必施之方略。夫醫雖小道。而關係於民族之復興者至重且鉅。蓋有健康之人民。而後始可與言强國强種之道。雪恥禦侮之方。醫界所負之責任。不亦綦重矣乎。故醫事建設云者。小之則爲醫界謀獨立謀發展。大之則爲整個之民族謀健康謀復興。不然。則一界之事。又何必擴而大之以云建設乎哉。</p>
<p>或曰。『醫界有待實行之事。千頭萬緒。子之所舉。僅十三端。毋乃有掛一漏萬之饑乎。』不知此十三項者。實能包括一切。醫事建設之基礎也。何以言之。夫教育者。人才之淵源。一切事業之根本也。本深而木茂。源遠而流長。故首以醫育。醫育莫先於課程標準之規定。有標準矣。而後人才可趨於一致。標準莫過於學理與經騐並重。並重矣。而後治病可保其無虞。雖然。此關於學術者也。而道德之修養。尤爲重要。故必增設醫師倫理學一科。不良之醫校旣因不合標準而改進而淘汰矣。而尤須增設合於標準之醫校以備正式醫師之產生。如是則面面俱到。醫育問題。似可解决。至於醫政云者。關係全國醫事之利害至鉅。全國之醫事機關。固莫首於醫院。故必先製訂醫院之標準。然後本此目標十一方則去其不合於標準者。一方則增其合於標準者。醫界之大敵。厥爲固有之舊醫與舶來之外醫。同時限制。則醫政固可免於分歧。利權尤不致於外溢。然後進而頒布保護新醫之法規。則毫無障碍之可言矣。以上諸項。皆屬政府所當爲者。亦有與政府無涉。而須吾醫界自爲之者。則醫團尙矣。醫團者雖無政治之背景。而有切身之利害。與痛癢無關者蓋有異焉。夫旣曰團體。則决不能有派別分歧之現象。故先之以精誠團結。團結矣。而後始可取締不良份子。限制非正式醫師之產生。至於保障醫業方法之研究。尤爲醫團之重要工作。蓋醫團者對醫界則居於服務之地位。對政府則有其顧問之立塲。不可以其僅爲一界之團體而忽之也。</p>
<p>由是觀之。此十三項者。實爲根本方略。而有其連續性對照性者也。歷年以來。醫界同志及鄙人所言者屢矣。而至今未能見諸事實。故特重加整理。條而列之。以備關心醫事之進步者參考焉</p>

<p>P&gt;疾病常識問答</p>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（三）（十）（七）慢性常習性便秘</p>
<p>（問）什麼呌做慢性常習性便秘</p>
<p>（答）慢性常習性便秘，是因爲機能的障礙而致糞便長時留滯在大腸中的疾病。</p>
<p>（問）起這種病的原因，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）起慢性常習性便秘的原因，很多。第一，是多吃肉類，蛋類，細粉等缺乏渣滓的食物。第二，因爲濫行洗腸。第三，因爲體質關係，或有雅片癮者腸的蠕動機能减退。第四，是大腸肌肉的痙攣，第五，他種臓器的持續性器質的病患，像胃潰瘍，十二指腸潰瘍，膽囊炎，慢性蚓突炎，婦科疾病，前列腺病，痔，肛門裂傷等。第六，內分泌障礙，像孕婦和甲狀腺機能减退等，都是。</p>
<p>（問）這種慢性常習性便秘，病太是否相同？</p>
<p>（答）並不一律。有的是糞便僅停留在盲腸，升結腸，橫結腸的右方三分之一部分，而其餘的大腸部分依然空虛的。有的是糞便的進行很慢。有的是在乎橫結腸，降結腸和乙字狀部起痙攣性而致腸壁陷凹。有的是大腸全部並沒有異狀，祗在直腸部缺乏知覺而致難起便意。</p>
<p>（問）慢性常習性便秘的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）排便非常遲滯，糞便成硬塊·腹中起膨脹感覺，頭部重感，頭內充血，全身倦怠，嫌惡工作，不眠，食慾不振。</p>
<p>（問）常習性便秘，可否行習慣的改正嗎？</p>
<p>（答）可以。患者宜每日準在一定時間上厠，使養成一種習慣，久之可以準</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>時排便。</p>
<p>（問）這種病患可否行食餌療法？</p>
<p>（答）食餌療法，在小兒有效；在老年人，效力就少。多用强烈的瀉藥者，更是無效。</p>
<p>（問）食物中有助瀉下的效果的，有那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）這類食物種類很多，可是僅適用於腸肌弛緩而致便秘的時候纔有效方。像糖類（蜜蜂，甜味的水果，糖果等，）有機酸類（檸檬酸，酸果）鹽類，礦泉，汽水，脂肪，肝油，洋橄油，植物纖維（蔬菜大豆等，）冷飲料等。</p>
<p>（問）常習性便秘，應用什麼藥品，可以見效？</p>
<p>（答）藥品的治療，先要斷定便秘的屬於痙攣性？還是弛緩性？斷定之後，纔得處方。</p>
<p>（問）痙攣性的常習性便秘，應該用什麼藥？</p>
<p>（答）痙攣性的須用溴素劑，莨蓉劑，阿特羅品，巴巴凡林等。</p>
<p>（問）弛緩性的常習性便秘，應該用什麼藥？</p>
<p>（答）弛緩性的，纔可服瀉下藥，並且最好以不用爲妥。瀉下藥中有一時性的，像蓖麻子油，旃那葉浸，硫酸鎂等。可以永久用的，像乳糖，洋橄油，流動石蠟，大黃末，煆製鎂，過氱化鎂，卡斯卡拉浸膏，</p>
<p>（問）假使單在直腸部缺乏知覺而致難起便意的時候，應該用什麼方法治療？</p>
<p>（答）這時候可行洗腸法。法用甘油五至二十立方糎，稀釋以倍量的水，灌入肛門內。或用皂水（百分之二三）或純水，食鹽水，洋橄油，芝蔴油等灌腸都宜。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c200">種痘閒話 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 臧荷百</p>
<p>種痘這一椿事，是非常普遍的，非常悠久的，非常平民化的，到也沒有什麼階級制度；他的學說原理和操作的方法，我記得程瀚章先生們早經發表過，毋庸我開留聲機似的再來開上這麼一遍；我現在把社會一般人們錯認了種痘的本意和種痘時所發生種種事項來談談吧！</p>
<p>我們種痘的目的：是因爲預防天花的傳染，換一句話說，就是因爲天花這樣毛病，人類一經感染到身上，是沒有什麼特別靈的藥，可以來治好他，設若看護失宜，經過不好，就要送命，是非常兇險的！種過了痘以後，就可以在一定時間以內，不會傳染着這種可怕的毛病罷了！並不是說種過了痘以後，凡一切的瘡呀癤呀癬呀瘍呀濕呀爛呀以及內科的病中所發生的癥狀如浮腫呀面黃呀食慾不振呀等等一槪都不會生的呀！假使說種了痘以後不曾生瘡呀癤呀癬呀瘍呀濕呀爛呀以及一切內科的病中所發生的症狀如浮腫呀面黃呀食慾不振呀等等；那麼他老早就不能呌做種痘了，應當呌做種瘡呀種癤呀種……顧名思義，根本不對！所以拿種痘來希望免除天花以外的疾病，是錯誤的。</p>
<p>老法種痘，早已時代落伍了；因爲他的漿，他的術，極不合乎消毒原理，有傳染別的毛病的危險，除掉一般鄕愚，在窮鄕僻壤的所在，還在操演着老戲法外，在大都市中不應再有存在了，然而事實告訴我們「某某先生中法牛痘逢某某日傳漿」的字樣，還常常的送到我們眼簾邊來，在中下等社會中，受他蠱惑，爲他座上顧客，還可說是缺乏普通知識，不能厚非！最令人不可思議的，有一般受過科學訓練的人們，也做他的顧曲家，大開其倒車而不知，眞眞矛盾極了！</p>
<p>在這一般種老法牛痘先生們嘴裏說：「老法牛痘發得透，一生不要種二回」，但是我們爲人復種牛痘，遇到曾經種過老法牛痘的人們而發的，很多很多，我的妻子，我的侄兒，就是好例子，他們在三二十年前，都種過老法牛痘的，在這十幾年來，我替他們種痘，都已發過兩次了，「發得透」的話在那裏？並且我們看病看到天花病人，固然因爲他的保護者的忽略，不曾及時代他們子女種痘，以致發生的不少，然而看到幾十歲的人，出天花的，又是很多很多，難道他們在幾十年前不曾種過老法牛痘嗎？「一生不要種二回」的話，又在那裏呢？</p>
<h3 id="c201">肺結核淺說（十八） <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第七章　肺結核的一般症象</p>
<p>一提起肺結核的症象，正合着我們中國一句舊話：一部廿四史，眞不知從何處說起方好；他是千頭萬緒的。我敢大胆地說一句：一切的疾病症象，幾乎都可以直接或間接附會到肺結核上面去的。他的經過情形，大半是慢性的；在他病症開始的時候，大多數是帶潛伏性，很少有顯著的症象，使人一望而卽加以揣測的。有時候病人發生咳嗽而感覺排痰困難了，這種症象，和平常的「氣管枝炎症」是一樣的；許多病家都覺得，這是受了一點感冒了，當然不會特殊留意的。有時候係除食慾不佳外，毫沒有另外的症象的，這種情形，大家又都當作「胃炎症」了。有些婦女們，他們的面色是帶蒼白的，月經是不大準確的，這種僅有的症象，狠容易使人想像到「萎黃病」上面去的。有時候發生失眠，疲倦，食慾不佳，這一類的症象，又和尋常的「神經衰弱症」狠類似的。這幾件都是尋常習見的，但卽這一點，已經使病家自身目迷五色了；就是醫家正當的認識，也是感覺非常困難的。此外，我們曉得，肺結核病的最初，大都和肺門腺體脫不了關係的；這方面當然有接近的神經的，如果迷走神經（第十腦神經）受了腫脹的腺體壓迫，那末病家當時，就會發生心跳，胃部劇痛，這一類症象，也决不容易使人向肺部方面想像的，像夜間盜汗，比較的總算是本病開始的顯著症象了，但在神經衰弱一症方面，有時也是有的。根據這種種事實，可以曉得本病最初的情形，是千頭萬緒包羅萬有的；是非的堅决診斷，固然是一時辦不到；就是最初始起病時日的决定，恐怕也沒有人能够完全回答出來的。</p>
<p>上面所舉的幾種症象，如果確係肺結核症，那當然不會無緣無故停止的；他們是從此方興未艾的。到了日子一久，患者的身體漸漸消瘦了，體重也輕减了；碰着有點常識的病家，他們是知道應該測量體溫了，假使結果確係在增高，並且每天都狠平均的；他們也曉得，這種現象决不是無因而至的，當然非尋醫生詳察其究竟不行的。但是大多數的病家，仍然是不甚注意的；並且這體溫較高的症象，是除了用檢溫器測量外，病人自身是無所感覺的。一直到了肺部本身咳嗽痰唾的症象一天顯着一天了，體重是更加輕减了，或且痰唾中發現血絲了，這種咳血症象，對病　家差不多像下最後警告似的。到了這個時期，病家們也曉得不能再馬虎了；但結核病根已經有相當的程度了，在治療方面，沒有最初那樣的省力，是可以斷言的。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（十二）腺窩性扁桃腺炎Tonsillitis　lacuualis</p>
<p>扁桃腺的肥大和增殖。已經在上兩期講完了。現在要講到他的炎症。這種炎症因爲他的發生部位和病理的不同。所以在臨床上有各種扁桃腺炎的名稱。本題所論的一種扁桃腺炎。是一種急性傳染性口蓋扁桃腺炎。也就是扁桃腺炎當中最多的一種（一般俗間謂爲乳蛾漲或喉痛時。多數是指這個病。）本病發在二十歲到三十歲左右的成人最多。小兒較少。男女的關係。是沒有的。旣不能說男多。又不可說女少。在有扁桃腺肥大症的人。是比較容易感染本病。反轉來說。在扁桃腺已經生理的萎縮的老年人。那就很少。這個病是和倭麻質斯（俗稱風濕痛）有連帶關係的。這是近來醫學界公認的事實。生了一回扁桃腺炎。並非不再生第二回。甚至時常發生。此時可稱爲習慣性安琪娜Anginachabitualis。本病常常爲流行性。所以在家庭，學校。軍隊，監獄等處。時常遇着流行傳染。他的主要傳染病原菌。就是連鎖狀球菌。其次爲葡萄狀球菌和肺炎菌。本病對於氣候也有關係。譬如在濕寒的氣候和氣溫的劇變。是容易發生些。所以在統計上看起來。要算八九兩月最多。次爲十月十一月十二月一月七月。本病的發作。起首大槪都有惡寒戰慄。然後發熱。時常可到攝氏四十度左右。同時咽頭部感覺疼痛。嚥下的時候。更覺劇烈。夜眠不安。疼痛往往波及耳部。所以病人常用手來按住耳部。面容現出苦惱的樣子。言語和飲食都感不便。全身陷入疲乏的狀態。頭痛腰痛。口渴口臭。顎下淋巴腺腫脹。而有壓痛。舌被白苔。此時如果檢查咽腔。就可看見口蓋扁桃腺著明腫大潮紅（通常兩側。）在腺窩的部位。被有白色或淡黃白色的小點伏膿栓。若將膿栓行顯微鏡檢查。則可見連鎖狀球菌或葡萄狀球菌。這等小點狀膿栓往往可以聯合成一膜狀。遮住扁桃腺的表面。外觀和白喉一樣。所以病人也就常常當作白喉。去求醫師診治。</p>
<p>本病的經過。如果良好的時候。那就經過幾天的醫治。各種病象都可减輕（像熱度的降下，疼痛的减退，扁桃腺消腫退紅等。）他的完全治愈。大約要一星期左右。不過常有在各種病象减經後的第二天或第三天。忽然體溫上昇。各種病象又復發現。這是大槪發生扁桃腺周圍炎的緣故。從扁桃腺的周圍炎，又可變成周圍膿瘍。此時必定要行手術。方可排膿治愈。關於扁桃腺的周圍炎和周圍膿瘍。下期或可詳述。</p>
<p>講到本病的治療。可分作五條。就是一、內服藥＝如果經過專科醫師診察决定本病後。卽刻可服金鷄納霜Qninine分量可由醫師審定開方。我不可隨意妄言一定的分量。這是照年齡和體質而定的。他的好處。就在可以短縮本病的經過。使他容易痊愈。二、局部療法＝可分塗布藥，含漱藥，和罨包法的三種。這都是醫師指導下的事體。三、在習慣性安琪娜的時候。最好施行扁桃腺切除術或摘出術。四、患倭麻質斯的病人。一定要告訴醫師。有過本病沒有。就是沒有。也要囑托醫師檢查扁桃腺。因爲常常有連帶的關係。五、要輕於接受白喉血淸的注射。我在臨診時，遇到患扁桃腺炎的病家。往往說「已經注射過白喉血淸。爲什麼還不見效。」這時候我狠難判斷。旣不能說注射白喉血淸的醫生是錯誤。又不可批評血淸的不良。不過我希望閱報諸位要注意的。有三點。卽甲、白喉血淸只對於白喉，發生惟一特別的效力。對於扁桃腺炎。是沒有效力的。乙、如果醫生要注射白喉血淸的時候。最好要憑顯微鏡檢查的報告單（就是有無白喉桿菌。）丙、患扁桃腺炎的病人。如已注射白喉血淸雖沒有什麼危險。只有損失金錢和血淸的信用。但是在第二回注射無論那一種血淸的時候。最好告訴醫生。說明某年某月某日。曾經注射白喉血淸。因爲可以引起醫生的注意。預防血淸的反應。</p>

<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來遠客家徒四壁渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>及至自己回味過來，偏是這一大截路，正是又直又平，五分鐘的功夫，早跑出了六七里路。他呌道：哦喲！我帽子丟了，把車子停一停罷。趙國富道；外國人坐在前面，那個呌得住停車子？李士廉道：外國人怕什麼！我在上海，整天看見外國人。在租界上，也只有對英國人美國人法國人，外交不大好辦。若是白俄，就可以和他開玩笑。德國人現在沒有勢力了，怕他作什麼？趙王二人，都是和德國人作伙計的，聽了這話，很是不服氣。但是自歐戰而後，德國人在中國實在沒有什麼勢力了，這又如何能否認他的話？於是王老五由側面進攻，問道：假如遇到日本人，也敢和他開玩笑嗎？李士廉道：除非是在上海虹口遇到他們由他猖狂。若是在法租界遇到他們，諒他也不敢怎樣？這一篇外交通論暢談而後，車子是走得越遠，他那一頂帽子，也就只好白白犧牲，不去管了。但是他被王老五這樣暗損了幾句，知道他是捧德國人，心想這兩個人的思想，充其量，眞可以做漢奸。活活兩個勢利鬼。王老五也想着，這樣的冒失鬼，也要到陝西來找差事。假使他眞在陜西弄到了差事的話，那個地方，一定是天高三尺。於是彼此互相用冷眼看上一下，都靜肅起來。張介夫兩手枕了木頭箱子，也兀自出神。却聽到網籃裏嘎咤一聲嚮，不知道是什麼玻璃磁器之類的東西打破了，接着便有一陣酒味向鼻子裏送來。他生平所好的就是一口酒，有個綽號，就呌酒鬼張三。在這風吹，土灑、日曬的車子上，正不知如何是好。（五）</p>

<p>裹在制服裏的交通維持者，關了紅燈，開了綠燈，電車，汽車，活像鐵甲車，坦克車，目中無人的衝頭陣。</p>
<p>跟着是自行車，黃包車，最後，是拐了二條孤拐的人們。</p>
<p>從這裏，充分地表現着科學的權威。用電力的，用馬達的，已戰勝了僅恃着一些機械的東西。拐着二條腿的，是然是最落伍了。</p>
<p>綠燈關了，紅燈開了，橫馬路上的車輛，行人，也是這麼的一個畫面。</p>
<p>這便是馬路口的秩序的機械化，也就是所謂「安全爲第一」。</p>
<p>紅是代表危險，綠是指示平安。</p>
<p>但是儘有些人在紅燈下跨過馬路，儘有些人，在虎口般的馬路口流着殷紅的血，乳白色的腦漿。</p>
<p>除非是沒有了氣的，雖然是只剩了一絲殘喘，還會給人駡「屈死」，「猪玀」，因爲紅燈像怪眼般睜着，早就表示着危險了呀。</p>
<p>馬路上的車輛，行人，一刻不停的來往着，紅燈，綠燈，輪流地指示着人們的安全之路。</p>
<p>紅綠燈是負起了行人生命安危的責任，一天到晚的服務着，一直到人們安息了。才略略的閉一閉那二個怪眼。</p>
<p>但是一到天明，二個怪眼，又在馬路口睜着了。</p>

<p>今天全國舉行孔子誕辰紀念，中央特派大員往曲阜致祭，足見禮節的隆重。追念至聖先師，我國歷來認爲最莊嚴肅穆的大典，惟過去七年中，曾一度冷靜；如今纔由中央重申尊孔的意義，畢究偉大崇高的萬世師表，爲人們所尊敬，但形式上的紀念，終不如精神上的仿效，所以先師的道德·學問·事業，應爲我人身體力行的圭臬。</p>

<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>臨近菜市街的小茶館裏，到了傍晚的辰光，黑壓壓地擠滿了人。在碧綠的煤氣燈光之下，映出了大半都是些商界中人物，不是掌櫃，便是老板，大家聚着閒談，順便講講生意經，或者有什麼賣買可以成交。</p>
<p>本來大家來聽說先生講「三笑」的可是這位先生，因爲陳公館呌他去唱堂會了，一時脫不了身，所以這班聽客不免要老等，便紛紛的高談闊論，將屋角裏嗡嗡的蚊子聲音，也蓋得聽不見了。</p>
<p>一個落腮鬍子的肉店老板說：「這幾年的學校中，愛國已愛得不少。別的不用說，就講那XX中學的校長吧，眞可以說是愛國專家，隨便怎樣熱的天，在火也似的太陽光之下，扯開了喉嚨演說，滿頭是汗，眼淚直流，這是何等不容易呀！」</p>
<p>旁坐的一個禿子，將手裏抓着一把西瓜子，撒在桌上，也凑近了搭訕着道：「那個校長眞行，你只要聽他講什麼抵制日貨，什麼挽回利權，什麼臥薪嘗膽，什麼五分鐘熱度，說得何等有道理，我聽了他的話，很是感動！」</p>

<p>當那剔盡了骨頭和鱗甲的鯽魚肉，和着嫩豆腐一起煮好之後，便又第二度的捧到太后面前來：伊就用一柄銀匙，接連的喝了幾匙，同時還嘖嘖有聲地稱賞着。使我們這些站在旁邊的人，也看得垂涎欲滴了。後來，伊忽然把吃剩的一半，指明要賞給我吃。這眞是使我喜出望外了！因爲太后如果把吃剩的東西，或喝剩的茶水，指明賞賜某人吃，這個人的身價，頓時便增加了許多；不但旁人都在艷羨他，就是他自己也必認爲是一椿極榮譽的事情。所以太后此刻把這一味新鮮的魚羹，留一半賞給我吃，實在是很可喜的：何况用嫩豆腐和在一起煮的魚羹的滋味，的確是很不錯呢？</p>
<p>太后的食量雖然並不像一般老年人那樣的减退，但因御膳房所供呈上來的東西實在是太多了，無論一碗菜，或一盞湯，總使伊不能吃喝得罄淨；於是便養成了伊愛把餘剩的東西，賞給服侍伊的人去吃喝的習慣了。可是我對於伊這種恩典，總是非常的小心應付：如其伊並不曾吩咐我把餘下的東西吃掉或喝掉，我無論心裏是怎樣的愛吃愛喝，也必竭力忍耐，立刻把那原碗或原盅遞給小太監們去收拾；如其伊已經吩咐明白，要教我把餘下的東西吃掉或喝掉，那時我就不能再客氣，必先恭恭敬敬的向伊磕上一個頭，表示我對於伊的賞賜，已是十二分的滿意，感激，接着便把碗中或盅中所剩的東西，毫不遲疑的吃喝下去，無論我腹中是怎樣的飽滿，也得欣然服從，否則便是故違聖旨，罪在不赦了。（一一四）</p>

<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>今年，中央爲提倡孔子行述，以資崇仰起見，特提出第一三二次中常會，决定八月二十七日爲先師孔子誕辰紀念日，通令全國各地黨政機關籌備紀念。是日，市黨部將聯合市政府召集各界代表在南京，「文廟」大成殿舉行紀念會。一方面，國府爲示隆重，特派委員葉楚傖氏前往曲阜於當日主祭，並由五院及由教兩部各派員陪祭。－－原來，祀禮的「丁祭」，是又見於今日了。</p>
<p>說到上海祀孔的典禮，向以文廟丁祭譜做標準。這個譜是根據邑紳王慶勳所得醴陵丁祭譜而成。同治戊辰，蘇挨丁日昌刋譜於省垣，連版匯申，藏於尊經閣上。後來就由灑掃而重印。光緒末年，丁祭升爲大祀，部頒武舞譜，其儀節，祭品及樂舞方面，稍與以前不同，上海縣「未遑改易」。民國三年，政事堂禮制館頒祀孔典禮及服式圖樣，儀節及服式更與以前不同，於是由當時公欵公董經理處總董丁熙成會同文廟保管員林曾裕等酌古準今，規畫損益，祀孔典禮，乃燦然大備。到民國十三年，上海孔子廟樂舞主任范隱深鑒於勢移時易，舊有文廟丁祭譜已不完全適用（而且其版燬於民元兵燹，僅剩一二孤本）爰參照祀孔典禮，着手編輯「上海海祀孔譜。」半年成書，於民國十四年夏由灑掃局刋印。</p>
<p>按照還本「上海祀孔譜」，我們來看看上海的祀孔典禮樣式：</p>
<p>（一）通贊－正獻官，分獻官，陪禮官，先後就位，糾儀官升階糾儀。闢戶迎神，舉迎神樂，參神跪拜四拜。於是奠帛爵行初獻禮，舉初獻樂，跪拜四拜。武功之舞退，文德之舞進。行亞獻禮，舉亞獻樂。行終獻禮，至終獻樂，跪拜四拜。司祝者捧祝，司帛者捧帛，司爵者請爵，司饌者請饌恭送燎所。闔戶禮成。</p>
<p>（二）合樂節奏－將祭，先擊晋鼓三百六十數以警戒。（分三次擊）等樂舞生，舉列階下以後，就鳴轉班鼓。（鼓譜十有三節）歌生執笏，樂生執樂器魚貫隨麾；舞生執干戚魚貫隨節，由樂懸兩旁依序以進，各就位迎神，大成鐘鼓齊鳴，然後合樂（樂凡六章）迎神奏昭和之章。初獻奏籬和之章，舞籬和之舞。（第一成）亞獻奏熙和之章，舞熙和之舞。（第二成）終獻奏淵和之章，舞淵和之舞。（第三成）徹饌，奏昌和之章。送神，奏德和之章。每奏一章，麾生舉麾，高唱道：樂奏某某之章，聲音要勃然而起，上兩字一讀，下四字分排欲勻，長韻漸大，春容和雅，尾聲悠長，再擊祝三聲以起樂。</p>
<p>（三）大成殿祝文－有一定格式，總是：「維先師德參化育，道貫古今。集羣聖之大成，炳前知以垂憲。天下爲公，中國一人之量；生民未有，六經千載之心。循宮牆而瞻富美，入室升堂；隆俎豆而奉罄香，先明後法，茲當………</p>
<p>（四）大成殿的陳設－祭器有九種：爵，籩，簠，簋，豆，鉶，篚，俎，登；祭品除太羹，和羹以外，有三十二樣，陳設位次分六排，裝在「登」裏的太羹在四排正中，六排「俎」裏的羊牛豕遙對頭排三個玉爵。</p>
<p>（五）樂舞生冠服－冠色黑絲質，（或棉質）純緣均用黑地片金，（各省地方，樂舞生的純緣不用片金）靑纓無縷，覆版用方式，前後左右均以尖角向平置。冠章方形，縱橫徑一寸，銅質鍍金，上鏨篆書陽文「樂」「舞」。衣用藍色絲質（或棉質）長及踝，寬窄各其身；袖長過手；袖口六寸爲率，兩襟相掩如直領；領及下端均黑緣竟二守：領裥從翻捲式，腰裥後面，隨身圍肥瘦約之以組紐；通身繼小葵花。（各省地方樂舞生無鏽）。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c210">最近之上海拆息 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>拆息是測驗上海金融市塲供求狀况的度量衡，這個名詞，在不曾廢兩改元以前，是被稱做「銀拆」的；關於銀元的借貸利率，當時曾另有「洋拆」一個名詞；但現在是劃一了。牠的意義，是以每千元爲單位，計算一日間之利率。</p>
<p>上海的拆息行情有二：一個是在銀行聯合準備委員會所訂立的，另一個則是在錢業公會市塲。前者的票據交換狀况，因歷史與習慣關係，不及後者遠甚，其交換額僅及後者五分之一。就是在一般商界和華商銀行，也大都以錢業公會市塲所訂立的拆息爲準，所以本文所根據的也是後者。</p>
<p>在「銀拆」時代，上海錢業公會營業規則上規定：銀拆最高不得過於七錢，現在則規定拆息不得高至七角。回溯到四五年前，四五錢的拆息是常見，在金融活潑的時候，常常要高到頂盤。可是在一二八以後，在國內的，上海的經濟組織受了很重大打擊，同時又因爲受了國際不景氣潮流的波及，金融狀况一變而爲呆滯，而銀行事業倒反有旺盛之勢。所謂銀行業務之興盛，並不是指其本身之發達，乃由於資金找不到出路所促成的。得受金融之調劑者，並不是商家，農村，以及一般企業，而實是銀行的本身。銀行爲圖本身的安全計，往往不願意多放欵給一般企業家，同時企業家呢，可以立足的，因爲縮小範圍之故，並不需要放欵，至於正在風雨飄搖中的幼稚工業，正在需要欵項，而銀行方面不肯放出去。因此項僵局的結果，使金融常在弛緩狀態中伸縮着，這幾年和最近的上海拆息狀况，就是一個明證：</p>
<p>拆息按月平均表　　（單位分）</p>
<p>一月　　二月　　三月　　四月　　五月二十年　一三　　一　　二　　　二　　　四廿一年　一三　三五　一九　　一三　　　六廿二年　　二　　一　　四　　　四　　　五廿三年　　五　　一　　三　　　四　　　七</p>
<p>其中一月二月之間比較稍爲高漲一點的緣故，因爲那時剛巧在陰歷年關，商塲根據舊習慣，比較上銀洋的用途要繁一點，所以要統計本年的商情，實在要將一月或二月劃到去年度裏面去的。</p>
<p>今年拆息市情，除去了一月份不計，則其平均數，除一二十年份外，要算最低的年份。翻開了市情統計，就可看到拆息是在平穩狀態中，絕少突漲或突低的事實發現。推究所以然之故，除了總結到「不景氣」老調之外，我們也可以用評判一般商品價格的結論，是：供給多，需要少。先就供給方面來說。</p>
<p>上海因爲地位上是國際商埠之故，所以內地要採辦商品的，都要帶欵子到上海來了，又因爲特殊的組織之故，所以一般豪商紳士，爲避免故鄕的危險計，亦來上海，這兩項就是來源加多的最簡單原因。下面是一個現銀流動的統計。</p>
<p>上海現銀流動狀况　　（單位千元）</p>
<p>二十三年一月　　　二月　　　　三月　　　　四月　　　　五月</p>
<p>－國內　一、四五五　二、二二二　二、0七九　二、八四九　五、五0五　移入－國外　　　一00　一、二二四　－－－－　　－－－－　　－－－－　　　－合計　一、五五五　三、四四六　二、0七九　二、八四九　五、五0五　　　－國內　　　一五0　　－－－－　　－－－－　一、八0四　－－－－　移出－國外　一、四二二　一、七九二　一0、四二　－－－－　　一九五　　　－合計　一、五七二　一、七九二　一0、四二　一、八0四　一九五　出超（十）－國內　▲一、三0五　▲二、二二二　▲二、0七九　▲一0、0四五　▲五、五0五　　或　　　－國外　十一、三二二　十　五六八　十一0、四二　－－－－－　十　一九五　入超（▲）－合計　十　　一七　　▲一、六五四　十八、三三二　▲一0、0四五　▲五、三一0</p>
<p>上面表裏所稱現銀，是包括現銀，銀圓，以及大條。根據這表上。有一共同之點，就是在上海一埠；現銀的出入，國內常常在入超地位，而國外則反是。如果以從國內入超的現銀數和輸到國外的現銀數一比較，則前者往往超過後者：因此，上海的存底比較上要加多一些。但這表當然不能據爲十分精確的統計，因爲私運出口是不在其內的。</p>
<p>再有一相反的趨勢，是國內流入上海的現銀有加多的趨勢，而上海流到國外的則有减少的趨勢。關於前者，就可見得近年內地經濟衰落的徵候。在平時，上海和內地的貿易狀况，上海到內地去的是工業品，而內地到上海來的則往往是農產品和半製品，因此收支方面，不會得差得怎麼遠。農村一衰落，生產方面沒有着落，而消費方面，倒不能過於减少，因此，兩方的收支就愈差愈遠：爲要彌補這差額計，內地就不得不輸送現銀到上海來了。</p>
<p>也就在內地經濟衰落，購買力薄弱的緣故，因此國際貿易輸入方面也就同時减色，但入超當然是入超的，因此輸出國外的現銀數量就要减少了。</p>
<p>相當的印證，是查看國際貿易的狀况。近年的國際貿易，不論輸入或輸出；都要逐漸的减少。輸入的减少，就成爲銀用弛頹的一因。平時，內地將現欵到上海來，上海就用現欵運到國外去辦貨；現在內地來的欵要加多，而去路倒反而减少，因此形成一個積滯的局面。下面是國際貿易狀况的比較。</p>
<h3 id="c211">國際貿易狀况比較（單位千元） <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>廿一年一月　一六0·七五四　七四、七五九　▲八五、九九五</p>
<p>三月　一四九、一三二　八0、八四0　▲六八、二九二</p>
<p>五月　一八六、一八八　七八、六五七　▲一0七、五三一</p>

<p>三月　　九九、四二八　四0、一一五　▲五九、三一二</p>
<p>五月　　九四、九八四　四九、三二一　▲四五、六六三</p>
<p>照這個局面，供給方面大，而出路則國外方面旣沒有需要，同時國內的生產界也是懨懨沒有生氣，往昔江浙金融事業金融最活潑的一季，是蠶絲時候，可是這幾年所謂民族工業的蠶絲事業，就顯着慘淡形勢，尤其是今年。在民國十九年時候，有人統計上海的絲廠廠基有百零五家，絲車二萬五千零六十六部，而今年則不過三十三家，絲車七千五百十部，只佔到十九年份之十分之三而已。就是論到價格方面，改良種優繭最高之價，不過三十五元，最低不過二十元，以最近的去年市價最高四十四元，最低二十五元相較，就可顯然地看出絲業的如何地在困苦艱難中掙扎的了。</p>
<p>其次比較發達一點的紡織業和絲織業。也都有衰落的徵象。</p>
<p>就表面看，似乎金融狀態是游資過多，是一種壅積的狀態，其實不是，在衰頹中的生產界，其實頗需要金融界之接濟，可是沒有用，金融業因生產界之衰頹，如安全之故，不敢大意放欵；生產界因爲不能得金融界周轉之故，其範圍就更加縮小。這種情形，於二者都是有害的。</p>
<p>拆息的過低，並不是可慮的一件事，因爲利息低，則一切生產界的成本可以减輕；可是如今日狀態之下，拆息的萎靡不振情形，顯出生產界的無力，疲乏，少振作；則不但是金融業之致命傷，而且同時是生產界可非觀的現象了。</p>

<p>上海生絲出口之不景氣，始於二十年秋末，此後即無大批定貨：雖有零星交易，均以現貨充塞，减價競售，市况因之而低下，廠商莫不呌苦連天，後經政府救濟。發行公債，得以稍稍活動。二十一年春，日人侵滬，發生戰事，絲市亦隨之停滯三月之久。夏季稍有交易，大都存貨押欵脫手，時價每担在五百五十兩至六百五十兩之間。惟爲時不久，又見疲態，生氣日减。二十二年春，政府獎勵出口，每担廠經，補助銀一百兩，以公債支付，於五月底終止，輸出稍見起色。然絲業實質恐慌，仍如往昔，除上身廠家及投機分子，得享此利，其大部分固絲毫未得杯羹也。是年夏，受美國復興政策影響，市價上升，售値自八百餘元至千元之譜（生絲價亦廢兩改元），成交頗多，漸現一線光明。奈爲時不久，又如往日狀態，非但交易稀少，且價値日賤。普通貨在年終時，已跌至五百七八十元，計相差有三分之一之巨，我國廠商，類多資本薄弱，以致走避逃亡，實繁有徒。今春新繭未上市前，約在五百元大關。豈料新貨登塲以來，旣無交易，價亦日疲。近來市况，粗條份普通貨，僅値四百二三十元，而交易之少，更爲我國生絲出口以來未見之新紀錄。良以六七八月，向爲出口旺月，唯今年淸靜閑散，出於意料之外。計自本年六月一日至八月十五日止，白廠經運往歐洲，祗九八三包，美州九0三包，而去年同時期內輸歐三，二五八包，美五，五七0包。其最可憐之黃廠經，至今只有十包運歐，去年同時期內運歐計有一，六九一包，美一，五八五包。總計今年自六月以來，各種生絲出口，僅四，四一九包，去年同時期內，有一五，五五七包。約减少三分之二强。依此推算，本年度白廠經輸出，將在一萬包之內。不識吾絲業界將何以善其後。而黃廠經中之川絲，遭遇尤苦，旣還有大量存貨，而新絲又復源源生產，其處境艱難，實有過於江浙數倍。茲將近十年上海各種生絲出口數量，轉列於下。</p>

<p>上海生絲出口，素占對外貿易之重要地位，於全國經濟尤爲休戚相關。民國二十年上半季以前，歷年輸出，雖有上下，仍能保持固有地位；且售價方面，普通貨均在九百兩或一千兩以上。十七年至十九年，爲該業黃金時代，江浙各地，亦於彼時競設絲廠、銀錢業對於絲繭放欵，深表歡迎，以其時間短暫，易於脫手，不若他業之呆滯。庸知今日之絲繭，一蹶不振，以至於此，回首前塵，能無慨然，所幸近來國內綢廠，採用廠經，年可銷納約計三萬担左右。絲廠業之得以苟延至今，國內綢廠，亦大有功也。茲將其失敗因果分類言之，庶讀者於理想之外，或可另得參考。</p>
<p>（一）白廠絲－我國廠絲，聞名歐美，歷有年數。自日本見而生羨，經營研究，日事改良，且派大批專員，訪問用絲各國，以迎合買戶心理爲目的，歸而從事大量生產，以供世界需要。自美國採用均勻檢騐以來，日絲漸漸抬頭，再經專家發明新式省費設備，成效大著。一九三一年以來，且用匯兌傾銷，輸出大振。上海對美市塲，遂被打倒。日絲在歐傾銷，始在滬戰時。歐洲素不喜用日絲，彼乃用種種宣傳，且將其高級貨品，供人試用，乃爲所惑。經數度實騐，果然品質佳良與斷頭改少，均甚合用，而價亦特別低廉。華意二國生絲，於是大受影響，至今日絲在歐，已登堂入室矣。上海廠絲之所以失敗，不外下列各端：（甲）領袖過多，即叙集一二萬資本，毫無經騐學識者，自爲經理，以私人意志，粗製濫造，不知互相連絡，研究改良，市况上落，聽命於天。（乙）高級貨品，必待巨債，方肯脫手，不考查世界市塲趨勢。（丙）出品參差不齊，牌子太多。每一牌子不能供巨量之貨，且每批出品，各各不同。（此點有關原料品質，日趨低下，刻下對於養蠶改良，已有成效，當可進步，）（丁）數十年前意式繅絲機，不圖更改，於現代生產消費，大不合算。（戊）出口商之過事次毛求疵，乃用不正當手段，將貨脫手，以致整個失敗。總而言之，華絲品質，日趨低下，售價不廉，乃主要原因也。</p>
<p>爲挽回已失地盤，勢非絲業界蠶業界通力合作，方可見效。（甲）如無錫已著成功之某廠，至少有同式十數以上組織，最好共同另闢研究部分，以資改良，俾可與日俱新。惟此項組織，費用甚巨，最初數年，或遇世界經濟恐慌之際，不能獲利，須由政府維持，或與以種種便宜，庶當事者用全力做去，方有成就。（乙）普設高等製絲學校，訓練絲廠管理人才。（丙）養成生絲對外貿易人員，以備直接輸出。（丁）各廠繅成之貨，須一律交商品檢驗局，嚴格檢查，分別等級，給以證書，以期交易便利。其不及格者，祗准銷售國內，絕對不許出口。</p>
<p>（二）黃廠絲－我國黃廠絲，向以歐銷爲主，輸美不多。自受日意互相競爭，廉價傾銷，我乃失敗。其利害大致與白廠絲相同，惟四川黃經，產量甚巨，危險亦最大。</p>
<p>（三）七里絲－七里絲在十年前，早已入沒落之途。潯震商人，昧於世界大勢，其地盤在歐美，已被人造絲所占，是以輸出不多。至於印度及非州，以後亦將减少，大致因印度關稅增高及廣東絲粗條份，頗合該地需要，且價亦低廉，故廣東絲輸往印度等處，將見旺盛。刻下日本下級品，亦在試銷，惟成績平常。</p>
<p>（四）黃絲及黃土絲－此絲爲我國獨產，向銷印度及非州等生產落後之國。近年受世界不景氣影響及印度關稅關係，輸出大見减少。如各該帝國主義統治者，介紹科學知識，使土人逐漸進步，此類貨品，將無疑地入於沒落。</p>
<p>（五）灰絲（即榨蠶絲）－此爲東北特產，向恃美銷爲主，歐州之法意，採購不多，至今仍然使用，唯大顧客之美國，已改用人造絲替代矣。九一八以來，此貨大都運往日本。日人以其價廉，用生絲相互交織，製成綢貨，運銷歐澳及南洋等處，爲數甚巨。是以在上海出口，較最盛時，僅十分之一而已。如東北一日不收回，可不必多談。</p>
<p>我國朝野人士，覩此絲業危機，日言救濟，種種設施，不務實際，徒託空言，於絲業本身，反無實惠利益。而絲業團體，祗知請求政府發行公債，以救彼等一時之念，對於自身將來，毫無企圖與奮鬥精神。我敢大言曰，中國絲業需要急切的科學化救濟，主持其事者，尤宜正直廉潔，有深切生絲知識，富於世界市塲經騐者，方克勝任。若專事宣傳，言而不行，我國絲業前途，將不知腐化至若何程度。</p>
<p>末了附帶報告，日本桑田，漸有改爲棉田之傾向，試騐已見成功，刻正投資播植云。農業專家又有蠶繭改製人造羊毛之發明，將來年可减少一萬四千萬日元澳洲羊毛之入口，換言之，日人亦正爲彼之生絲業，尋覓種種出路，願我國人注意及之。</p>

<p>— 雯</p>
<p>在今年，先師孔子的聖誕，行將比前十多年間的任一聖誕，來得熱鬧。在這凡事信命的國度裏，夫子在天之靈的命運之榮枯盛衰，也只好從甲子流年中去尋求究竟。</p>
<p>本來，在中國這樣一個貧乏簡陋的文化學術領域內，孔子自有其不朽的地位。壞在幾千年來的聖人之徒們只知拿「子曰……」云云，做錄蠹職業運動的敲門磚，猶之於耶教徒之「吃聖經」一樣，孔們信徒們也有百分之九十以上是「吃五經」。其目的旣止限於「吃」，自然談不上批判，談不上創造和發揚光大。更加之以漢武以後歷代「政治聖人」的思想統治與漢代經生，宋朝理學家之羣的「閉門造車」，終於把孔子思想弄成一個千古之謎的「無名腫毒」。這固然是孔子在天之靈的不幸，但尤其是歷代文人知識分子的倒霉。因爲他們吃了幾千年的「孔飯」，却十九始終沒有從「詩云」「子曰」的字裏行間，認識孔子。</p>
<p>孔子思想之遭逢不幸，實自五四新文化運動始。那人多視爲「罪孽深重」，至今還在吃官司的老將陳仲甫，「隻手打孔家店」的老英雄吳虞，都曾對於孔子思想作過很深刻的批評。平情而論，這不能不算是中國學術思想界的一大進步。因爲，要有批判，才有進步，何况孔子哲學和政治思想中之某些有價値部分，又是受得住批評的。然而那一度對孔子思想重新估定價値的工作，却遭到衛道之士的瘋狂反對。反對之無效，繼之以造謠，陳獨秀就變成「百善淫爲首，萬惡孝爲先」的倡導者。</p>
<p>孔子神祇或言語文廟之「否去泰來，實自最近幾年始。兩年前，就有一二位憂心世道之流爲了正人心而息邪說，穿了大禮服或中山裝，用黃鐘大呂之樂，太牢全猪之祭來祀孔，接着男女分泳，禁止「拍拖」，查禁艷裝等禮教的堤防，也應時而起，這些工作也許給與摩登運動以若干打擊，而鏹水飛濺，「迷死」遭殃的活劇！也隨之而方便了一些新聞記者。</p>
<p>然而最鄭重而視爲大典的，自然要算一九三四年式的尊孔運動，幾乎是鐘鼓齊動，麟鳳復遊。蔚爲一時之盛的孔誕，惟小子不敏，當有一些意見，附帶說明。</p>
<p>第一，尊孔决不在於形式，中國人由大的政治以至於小的交朋友，都作興「形式主義」。尊孔而着眼於用甚麼樂，行甚麼禮，指導統一的儀式，也無非是形式主義的表現。其實，孔二先生在天之靈所需要的，恐怕還是側重在他的學說思想之批判檢討，因而獲得更大的進步與發揚。否則，謚以文宣王，尊爲大成至聖的一套花樣，歷代帝王早已行之有素，現在應該。要抽出其不朽部分並檢剔出其何以不適用於二十世紀部分，才能爭取孔道之合理的存在。我相信，聰明神智如孔子，如果他老人家死而有知的話，其在天之靈一定是懂得「奧伏赫變」之眞理的。</p>
<p>第二，凡屬「子曰」的那一全套，都不能當作政治符咒來用所謂「文光射斗」，本來是古代才子文人的一種狂囈的修辭。在現代，國際間每一空隙都充滿硝磺味道的戰爭危機中，能够「射」的，决不是「文光」而是大砲和機關槍。尊孔只是爲了學術文化的承先啟後而聊示敬意。如果靠了尊孔來當符咒。那就必然要受到最凄慘的失敗。理由最簡單不過：「小楷羊毫」或「七紫三羊」，畢竟是掃在紙上，不能當高射砲使用。</p>
<p>除了以上兩點，是我所視爲尊孔運動之大忌而外，我謹以至試，舉起兩手來贊成昌明聖道。「大哉孔子」！</p>

<p>— 炳</p>
<p>普魯東曾經說過這麼一句話：「財產卽盜賊」，這是名言，不，是至理。自私產制度形成後，以至今日，社會上弄出的無窮的糾紛，假使我們不存着某種私心，大槪是誰都認爲與財產有關吧。在私有制度存在的現社會裏，天然財產是具有着無上的權威，正因爲如此，所以做學生的就必然要劃算着將來怎樣升官發財，做官的就必然愛刮民脂民膏，等而下之，其他業工商百業者，亦莫不孜孜以利是務。這些，我們若以直覺去看，當然是發現不出它的錯點，以爲是人生合理的行爲，至多也只會謚語曰「利慾薰心」。實則大大不然，而是一種彰著的盜賊行爲。世人每只謂行偷竊者是盜賊，其實如上述的一般人，卽現社會上所有的人，何嘗不皆具着盜賊之心，財富的人，那個不是盜賊？看淸此點，則對社會之認識思過半矣。</p>
<p>眞理是不容易找得，因爲它要受時間的限制，也要受空間的限制。換句話說，它在這一個時間裏確是眞理，但到另一個時間裏却會變爲非眞理；在這一塊地方是眞理，到別的地方却變成了非眞理。比方說，三十年前的中國女子的三從四德裹足蓄髪是眞理，但到今日不但不是眞理了，而且遭受無限的唾棄。中國人對死者用埋葬是眞理，但日本人却不以此爲然，要用火葬才算眞理。這種例子，不勝枚舉，我想只有「情人眼裏出西施」這一句話與這一種事實，才是亘古不易無遠勿屆的眞理，無論在甚麼時候或甚麼地方，男或女對於他或她熱戀的情人總會覺得像是一朶唯一的鮮花。</p>
<p>四川田賦，預徵到了民國六十八年，這算是好現象，鄙人毫無訾議。祗是私心略有不安者，是爲現在的這民國，有不有這麼一個「長壽」？假若沒有，則這筆賬眞不知將來怎樣算法？……</p>

<p>— 道</p>
<p>流浪在大都會裏，過打單的生活，寂寞的心和寂寞的日子呵，找什麼法兒消磨時間呢？於是沉在舞塲中了。用着一顆寂寞的心擠入那並不寂寞的地方，雖然往往會使寂寞的感覺更加濃厚起來。但一聽見輕揚的曲子，富有肉感味的女人像。寂寞的影子也就會暫時離開身邊，掉落了我的寂寞的靈魂。</p>
<p>日子一久，便成了一種嗜好，有如抽烟上了癮似地。每逢覺得無聊，在屋子裏沉悶不過的時候，腿子就本能地往這些塲所滑了進去。自家亦猜不透的，要是不去，便會得抽出了心靈一般感到空茫沒着落。可是去了。却又不一定跳的，有時呌了一杯淸茶，半打瞌睡地坐着坐着，沒完沒結，挨到天亮，始終不跳一隻的跑出來。</p>
<p>這樣地，是患了沉重的黃昏病了。日做成夜，夜做成日，生活完全失去角度。一入晚上，燈火亮了，我的魔念卽跟着開花，烟士披里純地變成一個幽魂似的夜游人。</p>
<p>但是，那種繁華的景緻對於我終是隔一層厚厚的膜的。我向來也不曾發生過怎麼深長的興會。跨出了那綠色的玻璃門。獨個兒回到家去，寂寞的心依然回歸寂寞，並沒减輕。而且越陷於悵惘中。</p>
<p>但是爲什麼這樣做呢？生命是値得珍貴的。那種淫孽的生活，簡直是等於慢性的自殺，不能如此輕輕地毀了自己啊！要懂得那些女人都有一張專扯謊的糖甜的嘴巴，每個笑渦裏都是佈滿銅銹的臭味。一切的歡愛是全堆砌在金子的上邊的。况且這些地方壓根兒不是我所能去得，只是吃飽了肚子閒着沒事兒的有肉殼而無感覺的人們的迷宮。我應當是有感覺的人，然而何以要和沒感覺的人們混在一塊呢。</p>
<p>於是我開始痛心自己生活的無恥了。消磨日子的方法儘管多着，犯着揀這個糜爛的地方呢。我必得下决心斷絕了此種邪念。否則我就是個生的零餘者。因此在以後蹩進舞塲的時分，就一次比一次加添了憎惡的程度，極力地從別方面着想，使厭恨鄙蔑的成分盡量地擴張。使心情一步步與眼前的緻物隔閡。</p>
<p>將所有的女人看作毒蛇，看作蓋上了華麗的綵衣的鬼魅，蠕動在黑暗的燈影下，在偷偷地吮吸着那個的精液。可是人們都被那艷笑迷了心，不曾發覺掩住在綵衣裏面的醜穢猙獰的面龐。</p>
<p>而我是越瞧越淸晰，週身戰慄地起鷄皮粟子，使我駭怕，使我驚動。最後如逃生似的遁出來，回過腦袋去，瞥一瞥扔在後邊的人們還是愉快地在送自己進泥坑去，眞是可憐亦可笑。一方面，則歡幸自己擺脫了惡劣的環境，一下子全吐出困在心中的重重的鬱悶，另外呼了一口鮮活的空氣。</p>
<p>從此，我認它爲魔窟，再也不想去了。</p>

<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>富公公的塡房舅兄朱全貴，他起初是站在伍老太爺身旁的。他接受了妹子的哭訴，今天預備來說幾句撑頭話的，因爲屬於她面上的只有如哥哥一個人。女人家雖蠻不講理，這類事的勝敗在五家鎭上已有過不少先例，今天這末許多衣冠楚楚的親戚全集，站在富生方面說話的又佔了十分之九，所以她重託了哥哥帮這忙的。然而哥哥不是妹妹，他一見伍老太爺的來勢兇兇，他不能吃這了眼前虧，偷偷地溜出這周圍和他兩個小外甥打混去了。</p>
<p>富公公仰起頭來，都是那樣虎視耽耽的眼睛。他肚子裏再有一筆沒有說出來的債項！富生做親事的費用，已被伍老太爺硬生生地劃入賬內了。於是他硬着頭皮說：</p>
<p>「大伯伯，我素來不做虧心事的，弟媳年靑守寡，富生更是我的親兒子，不過…二年災荒，從前戰時事，到上海避難也化費許多錢，這一次富生討親我還負了債哩。」</p>
<p>伍老太爺似乎生氣了，手掌輕輕地在紫檀几上一擊，富公公忙低下頭去，他不明白自己說錯了什麼話，甚至自己說了些什麼。</p>
<p>「富明，我們伍家不能做出這樣不名譽的事，」老太爺一點沒有情面的說「你是要體面的人，等我查考歷年賬簿的時候，大家沒有面子了！」</p>
<p>「大伯伯，不要生氣…」富公公話沒有說完，一個使女從內堂出來說太太請老爺進去，這更使富公公急不出話了。他兩脚沒有移動地位的踏了幾步，終於像兎脫一般一溜烟的朝裏了。</p>
<p>小組會議立刻紛紛地談論起來，蓋住了送來的蟬聲。伍老太爺拍着富生的肩頭，「有我伍公公在，總不會呌你吃虧」。張得福嘻嘻的笑了，他覺得自己的計劃沒有失敗。</p>
<p>朱金貴同兩個小外甥不知什麼時候溜走了，大廳上差不多是淸一色的富生派，張得福自然是最出力的一員，兩位姑老爺和姑太太也早看不過富公公的怕老婆樣子，他們今天不怕大熱天趕到準備有一番口舌，但見伍老太爺打在頭陣，已完全操了勝利，每個人都得意地掛着微笑。</p>

Reconciling the Six Arts, like the North Star. The world is for all, great unity is admired. Valuing talent and utilizing ability, not for oneself. Only our founding father, broadly imparted this meaning. Concern for the Xia people, fearing barbarians. Brightening the foolish, strengthening the weak, the standard for the nation. Loving one's relatives and being benevolent to the people, showing the righteous way. Selecting the virtuous and enabling the capable, expanding the people's rights. Having become prosperous, what more is needed? Wealth and education. Worrying about inequality, plans for people's livelihood are effective. Thinking about subtle words, combining virtue and communicating with each other. Hundreds of generations will benefit, steering this grand creation. The nation is in great difficulty, the people think of authority. Exalting virtue and distinguishing delusion, using ritual to express words. Respectfully presenting fragrant offerings, the palace walls are here. Together awakening the people of heaven, may his spirit come." (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Confucius' Personality and the Spirit of the Age <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Yuanchong</p>
<p>(A Work Commemorating Confucius' Birthday)</p>
<p>Recently, the central government advocated cultivating the people's spiritual personality, and thus designated the 27th day of the eighth month, Confucius' birthday, as the Confucius Memorial Day, to promote Confucius' teachings. This is of great importance in correcting the frivolous customs of recent years. According to various accounts of Confucius' birthday, the Gongyang and Guliang Commentaries record it as the gengzi day of the tenth month of the yiyou year, the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang of Lu, which is the twenty-first day of the tenth lunar month. Song Jinglian of the Ming Dynasty advocated this. Huang Lizhou, based on the Zuo Commentary's record that Confucius died on the jichou day of the fourth month in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai, believed that this came from the records of his disciples, and the year and month were no longer doubtful. He also verified it with the Historical Records, Family Sayings, Du Yu's annotations to the Zuo Commentary, and the Ancestral Court Records of the Confucius Family Genealogy, all of which stated that Confucius was seventy-three years old. Therefore, tracing back from the sixteenth year of Duke Ai to the gengxu year, the twenty-second year of Duke Xiang, the beginning of the year matches. The statement in the Confucius Family in the Historical Records that Confucius was born in the twenty-second year of Duke Xiang of Lu should be considered accurate, and Confucius' birth should be estimated as the gengzi day of the eighth month of the yiyou year, the twenty-second year of Duke Xiang, which is the twenty-seventh day of the eighth lunar month, the same as Luo Mi's determination in the History of Roads. The use of the solar calendar now is for convenience.</p>
<p>Confucius' scholarship has encompassed the political thought, ethical philosophy, social morality, and educational principles of China for more than two thousand years, so it is not easy to discuss them all in detail. Moreover, almost all existing Chinese records have been influenced by Confucius' teachings. Discussing it too broadly will inevitably lead to vagueness and aimlessness. Therefore, this article will only discuss aspects that align with the spirit of the age and are sufficient to serve as models for the people's personality, as a source of inspiration. It will strive for breadth and conciseness, and avoid difficulty and obscurity. This is also the humble intention of Jingxian.</p>
<p>(I) The Influence of Confucius' Scholarship and His Place in Chinese National History</p>
<p>Based on historical experience, we firmly believe that any nation that can live and thrive in the world without interruption must have its own history, its own culture, and outstanding figures in its national history. History allows the nation's spirit to be glorified and promoted; culture allows the nation's progress to be expanded and perfected; and outstanding figures in history provide models of personality for the nation, allowing the people to emulate each other and strive for the top, in order to maintain the nation's honor. These three are essential conditions for the nation's spirit. Based on these three to study the history of Confucius, we know that Confucius actually forged these three major conditions for our Chinese nation, leaving them to our descendants, and establishing the great foundation of the Chinese nation. Ancient Chinese culture and scholarship were often scattered and disorganized. Although the Zhou Dynasty rose and the Duke of Zhou established rituals and music, creating a model with brilliant scope, academic books were still stored in government offices and not accessible for private study. It was Confucius who reorganized the classics, taught in person, elaborated and transmitted them, establishing his reputation, and only then did scholarship become accessible to the masses, and national culture flourish, and the work of education spread. Therefore, for more than two thousand years, Confucius has been the only great master in Chinese culture, inheriting the past and ushering in the future. This is his great achievement in national culture. The nation relies on history as the driving force of its spirit. However, ancient history is long and distant, and traditions differ. Confucius revised the Six Classics, using the Spring and Autumn Annals as a record of events, the Book of Rites to record institutions, the Book of Poetry to record folk customs, and the Book of Documents to record proclamations and oaths, all as supplements to history. This is why Zhang Xuecheng had the saying that "all six classics are history," and later historiography flourished, with vast compilations forming a magnificent spectacle for more than two thousand years. Although their style was not entirely refined and their observation of social changes was relatively limited, they have been unmatched by the historical departments of any country in the world, and their impact on national observation and gradual immersion in awakening the national spirit is immense. This is Confucius' contribution to national history. As for Confucius' own place in history, he is actually one of the three founders of the Chinese nation. The three founders are: the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, who pioneered the wilderness, expanded the territory, and first laid the foundation for China, leaving it to our descendants for billions of years without end, and is truly the ancestor of the nation's founding; during the time of Yao and Shun, floods were rampant, and the people's livelihood deteriorated, but Yu the Great worked hard for thirteen years, controlling the waters, dredging the rivers, and then the people were able to live in peace, and agriculture prospered, benefiting the people's livelihood and making meritorious contributions for all ages; Confucius followed Yao and Shun, modeled himself on Wen and Wu, widely consulted various opinions, edited the Book of Poetry and the Book of Documents, established the Book of Rites and the Book of Music, traveled through various countries, promoted the learning of governing the world, lectured and taught, with three thousand disciples, seventy-two of whom were proficient in the Six Arts, carrying on the past and opening up the future, continuing the interrupted careers of past sages, gathering the great achievements of scholarship, and becoming a model for all ages. These three founders either created the foundation of the nation, or benefited the people's livelihood with universal benefit, or were the masters of culture, all opening up a hundred generations to come, allowing our Chinese nation to stand tall on the earth, continuously and endlessly, shining brightly without limit. With these three founders as models in front, sages and virtuous men have risen up, one after another, and academic achievements and careers have flourished in a hundred ways, and our Chinese history is therefore brilliant on the earth, encouraging our nation to work diligently and forge ahead, cultivating the national spirit and increasing its self-confidence. Confucius' teaching and training, and his personality of enriching and shining by embodying himself, are truly the greatest foundation of our Chinese nation's spirit.</p>
<p>Confucius was a practical educator, and also a political scientist and philosopher. In any aspect, he was able to express his great spirit. Therefore, Confucius' learning can be applied to action everywhere, from the inside to the outside, extending from oneself to others, encompassing both the root and the branch, and uniting theory and practice. Therefore, what he taught was the learning of governing the world and engaging in politics, and what he learned was the way to understand principles and achieve practical application. He wanted to turn chaos into order, move from a state of modest comfort to one of prosperity, and ultimately to achieve great peace. Therefore, he said, "I would rather entrust it to practical action than to empty words." This is the meaning of knowing and then acting. In his teaching, the way of learning is to start with broad learning and then inquire carefully, to think cautiously and discern clearly, and only when one is absolutely certain and without doubt does one then return to diligent practice. This is the meaning of learning and then striving for practical application. The order of cultivating oneself and governing others is to start with investigating things to understand principles, extending knowledge to study and explore the essence, making one's intentions sincere to screen out external desires, rectifying one's heart to correct one's direction, and cultivating oneself to establish one's personality. This is the work of cultivating oneself. Once the work of cultivating oneself is established, then one is close enough to manage one's family, great enough to govern the country, and even more so to bring peace to the world. This is the effect of governing others. If the work of cultivating oneself cannot be practiced diligently and achieved deeply, then virtue is not enough to convince people, and talent is not enough to be constant and adapt to change, and one can never achieve the effect of governing others. If the effect of governing others is not evident, then it can prove that the work of cultivating oneself is not yet complete. This is also a discussion of the connection between the root and the branch. Therefore, when speaking of wisdom and virtue, he emphasized dual cultivation; when speaking of knowledge and action, he emphasized parallel advancement; and when speaking of politics and education, he emphasized consistency. He sought to have everyone hone their personality, be diligent in their practice, enrich their intelligence, and strive for the distant and great, for learning that is substantial and useful, and to maximize the work of cultivating oneself and governing others. His breadth and depth are truly sufficient to enlighten later generations endlessly.</p>
<p>However, although Confucius' scholarship is so diligent and substantial, for more than two thousand years, due to the fact that monarchs of various dynasties selected Confucius' sayings about respecting the monarch, interpreting them out of context, and vigorously advocating anything that was conducive to consolidating monarchical power, while other subtle words and great meanings were buried and not made manifest. This is one of the misfortunes of Confucius' scholarship. Generations of scholars devoted themselves to the study of chapters and verses, textual research, and empty theories of morality, burying themselves in old papers, and forgetting to return home until their hair turned white. Broadly speaking, there was the learning of commentary and exegesis in the Han Dynasty, and the learning of moral principles in the Song Dynasty, each exalting itself and attacking different schools. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the disputes between the Han and Song schools became divided, with clear-cut camps, each believing that they had obtained the true transmission of Confucius' learning, and even using the principles of Buddhism and Taoism to deduce the meaning of the classics, discussing metaphysics and practicing stillness, becoming increasingly empty. In fact, language and words were definitely not Confucius' meaning of practice, and maintaining emptiness and guarding stillness were even more contrary to Confucius' admonition of diligent practice. Therefore, the more scholars who discussed and wrote, the more obscure the true meaning of Confucius' learning became, and the constant principles could not regulate the people's ethics, and the changes could not save the country from disaster. Those who pursued careers then criticized Confucius' learning as empty and useless, but they did not know that scholars of chapters and verses were not sufficient to represent Confucius' learning. This is another misfortune of Confucius' learning. Since the opening of the seas, European and American politics, education, and scholarship have gradually spread to the East, and the Chinese people, shocked by their rich and powerful practical effects, have completely followed what they have learned and learned it. Therefore, they especially blamed Confucius' learning, or even created the saying that Chinese characters could be abolished and all thread-bound books could be discarded. This is another misfortune of Confucius' learning. How can they know that the reason why Confucius' learning is not manifest is that the blame lies with those scholars who are constrained by chapters and verses and use empty theories to confuse the truth of Confucius' learning. The development of a nation's character must rely on the cultivation of the nation's history and cultural spirit in order to maintain the nation without decay. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen, with his innate talent, deeply studied and widely consulted, swept away all the obstacles of Confucius' learning, promoted the lost learning, and understood the root cause. Only then was the true scholarship of Confucius able to be revealed to our nation in a clear and open way after two thousand years of hardship and distress. From now on, we should continue to inherit the subtle words, revive the fallen threads, to clarify the reality of theory and practice, diligently practice our accomplishments, establish the spirit of ambition and perseverance, reach the realm of high intelligence, promote universal relief in times of difficulty, and turn chaos into order. The people should strive together.</p>
<p>(II) Confucius' View of Personality</p>
<p>Confucius' personality is seen in his cultivation and learning, in his teaching, and in his handling of affairs. In his self-description of cultivation and learning, he started with "at fifteen, I set my heart on learning" and continued until "at seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing the line." In these decades, he never stopped working hard to cultivate himself. Therefore, he described himself as "He is the kind of person who forgets to eat when he is determined, forgets his worries when he is happy, and does not know that old age is coming," and also said, "Learning without being tired." This proves his joy in learning and his ability to gain something from it. In his teaching, he "teaches without being weary," "teaches without discrimination," and "guides people step by step." He also feared that teaching would be too easy and that students would take it lightly, so he treated them with the way of "I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor do I explain to those who are not anxious to understand. If I raise one corner and they cannot return with the other three, I do not repeat myself," so that students can cultivate themselves diligently and achieve deep understanding on their own. He encouraged students to be diligent and unremitting, such as telling Zigong the meaning of never resting in life (Confucius's Heavenly Omen), and deeply admonishing his disciples to "plan for the Way, not for food; worry about the Way, not about poverty," and "do not worry about not having a position, worry about what to establish," and the nones of "longing for home" and "being ashamed of wearing poor clothes and eating poor food" are all deeply clear and insightful arguments. As for the weight of his own responsibility and the courage of his self-confidence, he described himself as saying, "If someone were to use me, it would be enough in a month, and there would be achievements in three years," and after being the prime minister of Lu for three months, he achieved the practical effect of "men and women walking separately on the road, not picking up lost items, men valuing loyalty and trustworthiness, women valuing chastity and obedience, and guests from all directions feeling at home," and at the meeting at Jiagu, he dressed in ceremonial robes to intimidate Qi, and when he destroyed the three capitals, the power of the strong vassals was weakened. All of this was done with unwavering devotion and upright conduct, so he was able to influence others, and the powerful and strong would collapse on their own, unlike those who could talk but could not act. Moreover, the order of his measures was always to exhaust himself in loyalty and reciprocity, and to practice himself and extend it to things, so he "established himself to establish others, and achieved himself to achieve others." Even when he was in a difficult situation, at a time when petty people were obstructing him, he still held the spirit of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway" to take on the heavy responsibility of the world. How could the scholars of chapters and verses in later generations be able to look up to even a fraction of it?</p>
<p>Confucius' diligent and glorious personality was created by his broad and extensive learning, and the reason why Confucius' learning was achieved was that he was able to seek teachers and friends widely and consult and survey extensively. Therefore, Zigong praised him, saying, "The Master learns everywhere, and from whom does he constantly learn?" This means that Confucius' learning has no constant teacher. Therefore, he asked Lao Dan and Shan Zi about rituals, Chang Hong about music (Book of Rites, Record of Music), and Shi Xiangzi about playing the qin (Han Poetry, Outer Biography). He obtained the Book of Changes and the Spring and Autumn Annals from the Grand Historian of Lu, and Guan Bai Er Guo Bao Shu, like Zuo Qiuming of Zhou. His learning was extremely broad. Among his teachers and friends, there were those mentioned in the Historical Records, "He sought advice from Laozi in Zhou, Qu Boyu in Wei, Yan Pingzhong in Qi, Laizi in Chu, Zichan in Zheng, and Meng Gongchuo in Lu. He often mentioned Zang Wenzhong, Liu Xiahui, Tong Ti Bohua, and Jieshanzi, but Confucius was always behind them and not in the same generation." Because his observation was broad, he was able to develop great ideas and compile the sayings of the masses, and his seventy-two worthy disciples were all talented men of the time, each striving in what they had learned to enhance and broaden the master's teachings. This is why, while there were hundreds of schools contending in Confucius' time, after the change of dynasties, most of them declined and disappeared, while Confucius' learning became increasingly glorious, like a river gathering thousands of tributaries to become the sea, what it takes is broad, and what it achieves is great, unlike shallow streams, which dry up in no time.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who want to emulate Confucius' personality must emulate his lifelong love of learning and his tireless diligence, must emulate his tireless teaching and his teaching without discrimination, must emulate his combined use of theory and practice and his consistent conduct, must emulate his taking on the heavy responsibility of the world and his knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway, must emulate his restoring discipline and綱and his tearing down powerful tyrants and 理and his rebuking strong neighbors, and must emulate his consulting and surveying widely and his seeking teachers and friends extensively. Emptying his heart to seek knowledge and diligently practicing to take on responsibility, this is being a good student.</p>
<p>(III) Confucius' Teachings and the Spirit of the Age</p>
<p>The essence of Confucius' teachings lies in reorganizing ancient scholarship and culture, and developing and expanding it to later generations. The Six Classics speak of this in detail. What we should especially draw from his life and teachings today as a source of inspiration and encouragement is his great righteousness of expelling the barbarians and avenging wrongs, his theory of people's livelihood, and his doctrine of universal love. Keeping the Chinese people within the Chinese nation and keeping the barbarians outside has always been the foundation of the Chinese national spirit. The writing style of the Spring and Autumn Annals not only disparaged the barbarians, but also regarded those who were originally descendants of the Yellow Emperor but had the behavior of barbarians as barbarians. Those who were not of our race were especially placed in the category of exclusion. Therefore, the Confucian school may have criticized Guan Zhong's contribution to assisting Qi as being mixed with hegemonism, but Confucius praised him, saying, "Guan Zhong rectified the world, and the people still benefit from it today. Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our hair loose and buttoning our clothes on the left." He approved of him as being benevolent. The Zuo Commentary mentions the saving of the condemned by the people of Qi, saying, "The Rong and Di are like jackals and wolves, and cannot be satisfied. The Xia are close and intimate, and cannot be abandoned." This interpretation of the meaning of expelling the barbarians is truly able to understand Confucius' teachings. Later, Hu Anguo, living in the late Song Dynasty, when the northern barbarians invaded and the country was almost not a country, wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals to express his righteousness of expelling the barbarians and avenging wrongs. These were all able to inherit Confucius' teachings of the Spring and Autumn Annals to develop the great righteousness of the nation and extend the supreme teachings of expelling the barbarians. As for the righteousness of revenge, even though Duke Xiang of Qi was not virtuous, the Spring and Autumn Annals still praised his ability to avenge the wrongs of nine generations and concealed his responsibility for destroying Ji. The Gongyang school extended this saying, believing that revenge was permissible even after a hundred generations. This is the righteousness of avenging national wrongs. Sheng of the Song Dynasty also said, "Whether or not revenge should be taken does not depend solely on the distance of years and the change of dynasties, but is determined by the depth of the wrong. If someone destroys our country, cuts off our ancestral sacrifices, we suddenly abandon what gods and men both hate, and we must take revenge even after a hundred generations, as Song did against Jin." Peng Jiaping also said, "According to the Book of Rites, one should not live under the same sky with the enemy of one's father. According to the Tan Gong, Confucius answered Zixia's question about living with the enemy of one's parents by telling him not to live under the same sky with him, and if they meet in the marketplace, they should fight without turning back." This is also an extension of the meaning of revenge. As for his teachings of "behaving with shame" and "national shame is enough to revive the country," they are especially sufficient to greatly promote the righteousness of understanding shame and are what those who are determined to avenge national wrongs must repeatedly consider and pay attention to. Therefore, if we can constantly encourage ourselves with Confucius' great righteousness of expelling the barbarians and avenging wrongs, then no matter what strong enemy or foreign trouble inflicts us with aggression, our nation will be able to unite as one, unyielding and indomitable, and strive with all our might to avenge the national wrongs together. This is truly the essence of the national spirit, and it is this spirit that has encouraged patriotic people for thousands of years to follow one after another, to cut off their heads and tear their chests to defend the country and protect the race, even if they die nine times without regret. If the Chinese nation wants to survive on the earth, it must use Confucius' great righteousness of expelling the barbarians and avenging wrongs to admonish themselves daily, fathers instructing their sons, brothers warning their younger brothers, husbands encouraging their wives, and elders exhorting the young, in order to promote this righteousness of the nation.</p>
<p>As for Confucius' emphasis on people's livelihood, such as when he first served as the magistrate of Zhongdu, he established rules for nourishing the living and sending off the dead (Family Sayings). In his Analects, when discussing the policies of the two emperors and three kings, he specifically mentioned their words emphasizing the people's food, funerals, and sacrifices. Food nourishes life, while funerals and sacrifices send off the dead, which are truly the foundation of China's people's livelihood politics. When Confucius answered Zigong's question about governance, he prioritized having sufficient food before having sufficient soldiers. When he answered Ran You, he regarded the three things of abundance, wealth, and education as the major principles of governing the country. When he answered Zizhang, he regarded benefiting the people's interests as the essential meaning of engaging in politics. These are all refined and subtle arguments for considering the people's livelihood. The mutual use of the three meanings of abundance, wealth, and education is truly where the essence of national construction lies. Without abundance, there is no way to deeply plant its foundation; without wealth, there is no way to perfect its life; and without education, there is no way to promote its progress. With the three meanings presented together, the politics of people's livelihood are full and without omissions. The phrase "benefiting the people's interests" is especially the foundation of governance. If what the people desire is followed, and what the people hate is removed, then the people can each fulfill their lives, and the foundation of peace and order will be established. The highest principle of modern politics is nothing more than this. How can those who govern not embody and diligently practice it?</p>
<p>Confucius' meaning of universal love has been expressed completely in the two words "benevolence" and "reciprocity." Benevolence is to love people, and loving people must mean thinking about how to benefit them. Thinking about how to love people must mean being able to share the people's likes and dislikes. Thinking about how to benefit people must mean liking what the people like and disliking what the people dislike. Extending this meaning, people must be able to fulfill the reality of mutual assistance, and those who govern must be able to fulfill the sincerity of loving the people. If others have pain and suffering, it is as if one has it oneself. Wherever interests lie, there is no distinction between oneself and others. This is what is called universal love, which is also the original meaning of universal love. As for the meaning of reciprocity, it lies in extending from oneself to others. Therefore, if one thinks of peace, one would never bear to place others in danger; if one thinks of joy, one would never bear to force others into suffering; if one thinks of avoiding harm, one would never be able to inflict harm on others; if one thinks of pursuing benefit, one would never be able to monopolize the benefit for oneself. From this, one can further extend it to "respecting one's elders as one respects one's own elders, and caring for one's young as one cares for one's own young," and to what Mencius said, "Goods and beautiful women should be shared with the people," which does not harm benevolent governance. One should strive to avoid the bravery of a single individual and seek to be the great brave who conquers cruelty and eliminates killing and punishes the violent and pacifies the good. One husband and one wife in Yi Yin's country are not benefited by his grace, as if he himself had pushed them into a harmful harvest trap. Even further, the spirit of "if the people are hungry, it is as if he himself is hungry; if the people are drowning, it is as if he himself is drowning" is sufficient to express Confucius' meaning of universal love. Benevolence and reciprocity should be used together. Without benevolence, there is no reciprocity; without reciprocity, the effect of benevolence cannot be fully realized. Benevolence and reciprocity, the meaning of universal love is complete and without regret. Moreover, the meaning of reciprocity is not only limited to what is called "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself," but should also be expanded to "do to others what you want done to yourself." In this way, the meaning of extending from oneself to others, mutual benefit and mutual assistance becomes clearer, and the meaning of the Great Harmony in the Book of Rites is manifested. Confucius' refined principles of universal love are comprehensive and without regret.</p>
<p>(IV) The Future of Confucius' Teachings and Chinese Culture</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned meanings, we are already aware of the breadth and depth of Confucius' teachings and their relevance to the direction of modern national efforts. We know that it is definitely not as the frivolous and superficial people who do not read books imagine, thinking that Confucius' learning is completely contrary to the modern era and should be completely discarded. Therefore, if our nation wants to strive with hard work to fight for survival, to restore the glory of its past, and to illuminate the light of our nation's history, it must be necessary to study Confucius' teachings. Any nation that can independently survive on the earth must have its own history and culture, thereby increasing its national self-confidence and its courage to fight. From this, it will promote and develop its inherent culture, and then its national progress will be limitless. Although any nation cannot but vigorously pursue the culture of the era in order to adapt to the times, the culture of the era must be based on the culture of history, and the spirit of the era must also be based on the spirit of history. Otherwise, it will be like water without a source and a tree without roots, and it will never be able to develop fundamentally. Therefore, no matter how vigorously China's contemporary culture pursues the upstream, it cannot but take Confucius' teachings, which gather the great achievements of ancient historical culture, as the foundation of the new culture. Today, the invaders are deep. If we want to express the nation's divine bravery in defending the country, we must express our inherent national spirit. The driving force of the national spirit must lie in the nation's inherent historical culture and its model figures in history. Then, who should we turn to other than Confucius? Who should we turn to other than the model of Confucius' personality? To summarize Confucius' teachings that are suitable for the spirit of the age, in governance, we should express his firmness, his sense of responsibility, and the essential meaning of his benevolence towards the people, his love of things, and his great benefit to the people's livelihood. In resisting insults, we should express his spirit of expelling the barbarians and avenging wrongs and understanding shame.</p>

<p>It is rare to see a complete Confucius stone statue. This statue was created in the third year of Shaosheng in the Song Dynasty. It is exquisitely carved, and its expression is complete. It was buried for a long time in the wilderness outside the north city of Zhong County, Sichuan. The people of the county obtained it and established a school palace. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty that it was transplanted to the new Confucius Temple outside the city. Recently, Qin Yuepu, the director of the Finance Section of Zhong County, took a picture of it and sent it as a gift to this newspaper.</p>

<p>Chengde Communication: Agriculture in Rehe has always been dominated by opium cultivation. Now, at the time of opium harvest, large quantities of black goods are being transported from Rehe to various places. The quantity entering the Great Wall passes to Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong is particularly large. In order to control tax revenue, the Japanese and puppets have recently established an Opium Monopoly Office in Chengde, and have also established Opium Monopoly Branch Offices in Gubeikou, Malanyu, Xifengkou, and other places to handle the matter. All those not specially permitted by the office will be inspected and fined by the anti-smuggling team. It is heard that the revenue from the monopoly tax this season may reach over 30 million yuan. Also, the Puppet State Council previously sent personnel to Yuguan to investigate the sales of drugs there. As a result, it was deemed necessary to establish an office of the Opium Monopoly Office. As a result, houses have been found in Dongluocheng and will be established soon and start working.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese imitated our Aviation Lottery and issued the "Fumin Lottery" in the Northeast, many people have been deceived. The business of the so-called "Fumin Lottery Selling Point" in major cities and towns in the Northeast is very widespread and has become very developed. In order to expand their business recently, the Japanese specially established a "Fumin Lottery Selling Point" in Yuguan City to sell the lottery tickets, with a certain Japanese person serving as the sales agent.

<p>Japan and Russia Are Only Posturing</p>
<p>Negotiations on Buying the Road Have Room for Reconciliation</p>
<p>War Avoidable for the Time Being Due to Economic Relations</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are still paying close attention to the situation in the Far East. Several newspapers have published pessimistic news about Japanese-Russian relations. The Attack Newspaper said, "Although the situation between the two countries is like this, they will exhaust their diplomatic intelligence to avoid a break before a final split. It is not credible that they will suddenly have a conflict. Sending troops is indeed a show of threat, but its nature is still only a 'show.' Moreover, the major powers have not clearly defined their attitudes, so there is still room for bargaining and reconciliation between Japan and Russia." The Political Foreign Affairs Correspondence newspaper said that the alarming news published by the newspapers has caused many countries to worry. The China Eastern Railway has become a formal issue for discussion between Moscow and Tokyo. In fact, the price demanded by the Russian side is very close to the price returned by "Manchukuo" and Japan. If both sides are sincere, it will not be difficult to reach a compromise. The difference between them is only a few million yuan. Can they go to war for this small amount? In addition to this, there are other factors that make war difficult to occur. For example, Soviet Russia is experiencing difficulties both domestically and abroad. Although it has reconciled with France, it will not help the Manchurian battlefield. As for Japan, it is striving for economic development. The outbreak of war would be sufficient to hinder economic development due to the need for raw materials. Therefore, both are unfavorable for a war. Therefore, the conclusion of the Foreign Affairs Correspondence newspaper is that Germans all hope that the conflict in the Far East will not exceed newspaper debates and the exchange of diplomatic documents.

<p>Japan-Russia War Machine Is Imminent</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the intentions of senior government officials and experienced international observers, the tense situation between Japan and Russia caused by "Manchukuo" has reached a dangerous level. Important aspects here all express serious doubts, fearing that there will be an explosive event in "Manchukuo" that will plunge Japan and Russia into a war vortex. These observers all believe that the two countries do not want to fight at this time, but if an unexpected event occurs, neither country will be willing to give in and lose "face", then war will break out. As for the issue of the price of the China Eastern Railway, which Japan and Russia are fighting over, the difference is only 40 million Japanese yen, which can only be used for one day's expenses if Japan and Russia go to war. However, the leaders of the two countries will not take this into account and would rather risk the danger of war. The US military authorities believe that as winter approaches, both sides have large-scale troop movements, and the war machine is approaching day by day. (25th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Russian Personnel Serve as Technical Advisors to the Mongolian Army</p>
<p>A Form of Anti-Japanese Alliance by the British and American Navies Has Been Formed</p>
<p>(Moscow) There are two important indications in the thinking of the Soviet Russian newspapers on the Far East issue today. First, Soviet Russia believes that the three major naval powers cannot agree to the extension of the Washington and London treaties due to Japan's new position in the Pacific. Second, Soviet Russia clearly wants to establish the most friendly relations with the "Outer Mongolian Republic," because military experts all say that if the Japanese army wants to attack Soviet Russia, it must first pass through Outer Mongolia. The Communist Party's organ newspaper Pravda commented that the first phase of the naval talks has failed, largely because Japan is unwilling to discuss political issues at next year's naval conference and declares that it demands recognition of Japan's special position in the Pacific. Now, the naval countries have planned to greatly expand their navies. The only result is nothing more than the United Kingdom and the United States taking unified action on Japan's position in the Far East. Therefore, the fate of the naval conference has been decided, and the naval countries' struggle for dominance cannot be avoided. At the same time, a telegram from Outer Mongolia stated the actions of the Soviet delegation Garakhan and others at the tenth anniversary of the "Outer Mongolian Republic." In addition to sending many gifts, such as airplanes and cars, Garakhan also congratulated Outer Mongolia on its progress in the economic and cultural fields and the achievements of the Mongolian Red Army.

As of the 25th, the number of suspects arrested reached 70 or 80. Except for the main Russian personnel at the beginning, the rest were all lower-level employees. As for the arrest, some said that 80 people were arrested at once, which should be a false report. (26th Japan Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Blagoveshchensk) According to reports from Harbin, the Japanese and "Manchukuo" police authorities are still unreasonably arresting Soviet personnel along the eastern section of the China Eastern Railway. On the 22nd and 23rd of this month, the number of people arrested at various stations along the section increased by nine, and they were subjected to flogging and abuse. The Soviet citizen Leek Zichevsky, who was arrested at the Suifenhe station, was flogged in the police detention center for three hours. The Japanese and "Manchukuo" police wanted to use the flogging and abuse to force the arrested people to admit to crimes they had never committed. (26th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a telegram from Blagoveshchensk, another ten Soviet employees of the China Eastern Railway were arrested by the "Manchukuo" police in Harbin and other places. Several of them were senior employees, such as the secretary and accountant of the Harbin business department. It is said that the crimes they are accused of are very serious, and they have been subjected to torture and all kinds of abuse. Currently, Koznaitsev, the Russian deputy director of the China Eastern Railway, has lodged a serious protest to Li Shaogeng, the "Manchukuo" director, saying that the "Manchukuo" police cannot protect the train from being attacked by bandits, and listing recent derailment incidents. The protest letter also demanded that the fabrication of charges that China Eastern Railway Russian employees are colluding with bandits be stopped. (26th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japanese Military Department Ignores It</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Soviet Union did not approve of Foreign Minister Hirota's good intentions of mediation, it took advantage of the crisis of the breakdown of the Eastern Route transfer issue to launch its blatant anti-Japanese propaganda tactics. The Japanese side had no choice but to publish the entire process of the negotiations on the 22nd to correct the Soviet side's errors. However, during this period, the Soviet Union incited its bureau employees to repeatedly obstruct the train operations, subvert trains, and frequently engage in anti-Manchu and anti-Japanese conspiracies. Therefore, the "Manchukuo" government arrested its unruly elements, which is the so-called arrest of Eastern Route Russian employees. However, regarding this case, a certain Soviet Russian consul stationed in Manchuria lodged a provocative protest to the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency on August 15, saying that the issue of arresting Eastern Route employees was not to promote the Soviet Union's sale of the Eastern Route, but to attempt to increase troops in the Far East. The Japanese army completely disregarded the above protest and immediately ignored it. However, the general public believes that it is worrying that such frequent demonstrations and propaganda will continue in the future, and attention should be paid to its future.

<p>(Harbin) According to people from Daheihe, the Japanese army in Daheihe has increased by 3,000 in the past few days. There are about 7,000 Japanese troops stationed there, but the scale of the Japanese army barracks is very small. Now that a large number of Japanese troops have arrived, it is becoming more and more insufficient, so they are requisitioning civilian houses and forcing the Chinese to leave their houses. Since the establishment of the Manchuria Gold Production Company, the Chinese have been unable to extract placer gold and have become extremely poor. Now they have been forced to cede their houses, and the tragic situation is unbearable to watch. (26th Hualian Dispatch)</p>

<p>Plans to Establish an Aviation Network</p>
<p>Emphasis on Liaison Between Civilian and Military Affairs</p>
<p>Completed in Two Phases on a Large Scale</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Communications has been vigorously studying the expansion of civil aviation as part of its national policy. It has now drafted a general outline for expanding aviation and will soon submit the plan to the Army and Navy. The main points of the outline will focus on civil aviation while organically integrating it with the Army and Navy aviation, linking transportation aviation with national defense aviation. The total cost of the first phase of the plan is approximately 20 million yen, with over 2.8 million yen for the first year already included in the next year's budget proposal and submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The second phase of the plan aims to counter the regular air routes opened to the Orient by European countries and the advancement of the Soviet Union and the United States in the North Pacific. It also includes the circular air routes for important Japanese cities, requiring a cost of over 100 million yen. The scale is extremely broad and immense. The details of the two phases of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>"Phase 1" Regular air routes between Japan and Taiwan, regular air routes between Japan and the South Seas, regular air routes between Tokyo and Sapporo, regular connecting air routes between Osaka, Tokushima, and Kochi, the Osaka-Matsue connecting route, the Osaka-Fuji-Nagano connecting route, and the Tokyo-Nagano-Niigata route.</p>
<p>"Phase 2" New routes must be established between Taiwan and the South Seas, the Sapporo-Sakhalin route, the Kanto-Tohoku circular route, the Hokuriku-Sanin route, the Tokai-Sanyo route, and the Kyushu circular route. (26th Japanese Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Problem of Abolishing the Naval Treaty <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Japan Studies Carefully</p>
<p>Early Notification May Provoke Negative Reactions from Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Navy Advocates Adapting to Circumstances After the Preparatory Conference</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of abolishing the Washington Naval Treaty, internal opinions within the government have become consistent. However, there is still room for study regarding the timing and procedures. The Bureau of Legislation and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Navy are carefully conducting research. The countermeasures for arms reduction in the Navy will be submitted to the Cabinet Council in early next month at the same time. Regarding the timing of the abolition notification, the Navy believes that if it is done before the preparatory negotiations convened in October, it would only stimulate the emotions of Britain and the United States. It is better to wait for the outcome of the preparatory negotiations and then adopt a flexible response. However, although the preparatory conference was scheduled to be held in October, according to recent information, the United States is quite panicked by Japan's proposal to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty. Therefore, its naval plan will also deploy its main force along the Pacific coast, and it is a fact that it has moved a portion of its Atlantic Fleet's base to the Pacific coast. On the other hand, Britain, which is convening the conference, is also working to postpone the preparatory negotiations, and Britain's courage is also diminished due to the turmoil in European politics. Therefore, there is a possibility that the United States will agree to the postponement method. If the preparatory negotiations are held separately by the participating countries, it will take a considerable period of time. The Japanese Navy believes that if the preparatory negotiations are postponed until next year, then, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, waiting for the outcome of the preparatory negotiations would be a missed opportunity, and there are many concerns. Regarding this point, the Navy is making every effort to severely warn about the situation in Britain and the United States in order to deal with it. (26th Japanese United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of abolishing the Washington Naval Treaty, Minister of the Navy Osumi, bearing the unanimous expectations of the entire Navy, contacted various parties. First, at the two Five-Minister Conferences, he strongly argued for the necessity of abolishing the treaty. Then, Prime Minister Okada, as well as the Ministers of the Army, Foreign Affairs, Finance, and other related ministers, expressed their agreement and felt the need to quickly decide on the government's intentions. Therefore, Prime Minister Okada plans to submit the issue of treaty abolition to the Cabinet Council on the 31st of this month, or at the latest on September 4th, for endorsement. The Prime Minister will explain the proceedings of the Five-Minister Conference, which should be definitively acknowledged. However, the timing and procedures for notifying the abolition will not be predetermined. Only the general policy approved by the Cabinet Council will be announced. The details of the decision are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government, in order to break free from the constraints of existing treaties that are unfavorable to it (i.e., the Washington Treaty), has decided to abolish it. (2) The timing for notifying the abolition is set before December 31, Showa 9 (1934). The purpose of the notification is because the Navy authorities have exchanged views with the Foreign Affairs authorities, with no gaps between them, and have fully considered the objective situation. It has been decided that the Japanese Embassy in the United States will notify the U.S. State Department in writing in order to declare the unwavering belief of the Japanese government and to express the situation to those inside and outside the country. (26th Japanese Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There is a strong voice within the government requesting that Foreign Minister Hirota or Minister of the Navy Osumi be appointed as the Japanese Chief Plenipotentiary to attend next year's disarmament conference. Prime Minister Okada is also paying close attention to this. On the other hand, there are requests for former Prime Minister Saito Makoto to step forward, but this is as difficult as Prime Minister Okada stepping forward himself. Even if next year's conference breaks down, there is a need for someone with the skill and strength to declare Japan's firm attitude to the world and make it understood. Moreover, from a national standpoint, it is hoped that Minister of the Navy Osumi or Foreign Minister Hirota will be sent. (26th Electric Communications)</p>

<p>(London) Chairman Tittot of the Asiatic Petroleum Company told the Associated Press today that the recent export of silver from China is almost entirely due to fears that the Chinese government will impose an export tax. Tittot said that if it is certain that there is no such tax, the company's silver will still be returned to China, and others holding large amounts of silver will also take the same approach. Tittot expressed strong agreement with U.S. President Roosevelt's silver policy, stating that a stable monetary system does not necessarily have to be a monometallic system. The previous decline in silver prices was due to someone manipulating and raising gold prices. Therefore, like President Roosevelt, he believes that if people deliberately suppress the currency of hundreds of millions of people, it will be difficult for the world economy to recover.

<h3 id="e70">Commemorating Confucius <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>The 123rd Central Standing Committee resolved to designate today as a "National Memorial Day" to commemorate the birth of Confucius. We cannot help but have some thoughts on this. Let us try to elaborate on them.</p>
<p>The main factors constituting a nation, besides a common language and writing system, should be its common history. And within history, what can most deeply imprint itself on people's minds and linger there are the great figures and their words and deeds. The English often boast to the world about having a Shakespeare. The Germans also pride themselves on being the most cultured nation because they have Kant and others. This is not to say that transcendent personalities can truly be unprecedented and unparalleled, illuminating the ages. Rather, it is to use the greatness of the nation's past to awaken its confidence for the future, enabling it to carry on the past and forge ahead to compete in today's world. Precisely because of this, even though Ireland has been merged with England for hundreds of years, in order to maintain its independent existence and develop its future national destiny, it still strives to restore its inherent culture and promote its inherent history, thereby continuing its interrupted historical sentiment and extending its severed national feelings. Compared with any other country in the world, our country's past was characterized by splendid culture, a long history, and numerous great figures. There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Today, as the nation's power declines, faced with foreign aggression, and with national sentiments scattered to the extreme, selecting one or two great figures in history worthy of worship and commemorating them regularly to boost the nation's demoralized spirit and enable it to be bold and proactive is a necessary measure. And the authorities' choice of Confucius seems to have even deeper meaning.</p>
<p>Confucius is the most worthy of worship of all the great figures in our country's history. This is an undeniable fact. Recent commentators often say that during the Zhou and Qin periods, a hundred schools of thought contended, and there were many astonishing and valuable academic achievements. Yet, from the Han dynasty onwards, only Confucius was revered as the sole authority, remaining so for thousands of years. The reason for this is that Confucius's doctrines aligned with the psychology of emperors, and thus he was revered by emperors of all dynasties. There is some truth to this. However, to say that Confucius was revered solely for this reason is not only to belittle Confucius's personality but also to turn those who worship him into unconscious, blind human beings. The falsity of this claim cannot be concealed.</p>
<p>We believe that Confucius is revered for several reasons: (1) his personal character; (2) his proposals for saving the world; (3) his attitude of "not compromising"; and (4) his teachings on life. What was Confucius's personal character like? No one knows better than his disciples. Confucius lived in a chaotic world. He was not successful in Lu and was not accepted in Wei. He was also trapped between Chen and Cai, wandering for fourteen years and ultimately unable to realize his ambitions. However, during these times of hardship, his disciples' devotion to Confucius did not diminish in the slightest. Zilu even wanted to follow Confucius to "float on the sea on a raft." Zigong also said, "The Master's Way is great, therefore the world cannot contain it." Never did their sincerity of belief diminish due to Confucius's lack of success. How could this be achieved without the power of his personal influence? And after Confucius passed away, his disciples all observed mourning for three years, along with three years of mourning in their hearts. Zigong even built a hut and lived alone by his grave for six years. More than a hundred other disciples moved to live near the grave, eventually forming the Confucius Village of later generations. All these facts cannot be explained solely based on the reverence of later emperors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Confucius's political proposals were also a reason for his being revered by later generations. Confucius lived when the Zhou dynasty had already declined. The feudal lords invaded each other, wars were frequent, and the people suffered. Confucius's political proposals at that time were to practice the Way of Kings and reject deception and force. He even disagreed with Guan Zhong's actions of "uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying the world," saying that Guan Zhong could only make Qi a hegemon, not a king. Therefore, Confucius's intention was to prioritize the unification of China. If unification could be achieved, then it would not be necessary to repeatedly revere the Zhou dynasty, whose national fortune had already declined. From Confucius's traveling among the states to seek to serve the world, it can be seen that his ambition was truly to have any state become king of the world, and not to revere the Zhou dynasty. Therefore, it is said, "If someone were to employ me, I could accomplish something in a month, and in three years there would be success." Is this why Confucius became a "sage of the times"? What Confucius sought was a unified China, and his method was the Way of Kings, which refused to "kill one innocent person to gain the world." Therefore, he said, "If distant people do not submit, then cultivate virtue to attract them." Confucius's proposals at the time were not only to seek the unification of China but also to seek the abolition of civil war in China.</p>
<p>A third aspect worthy of our reverence is that although Confucius was restless and anxious in seeking to serve the world, he would serve if he could implement his proposals, and he would retreat if he could not implement his proposals, without any lingering attachment. Therefore, when Confucius was the minister of Lu, as soon as Ji Huanzi indulged in the Qi female musicians and neglected state affairs, he left Lu for other places. Thereafter, he traveled among the states, using the ability to implement his proposals as the principle for advancing or retreating. It can be seen that Confucius was truly a statesman with proposals, not a politician who only knew how to seek wealth and status. Therefore, it is said, "Wealth and honor obtained through unrighteousness are like floating clouds to me."</p>
<p>As for the cultivation of life, the teachings valued by the ancients, none surpass those of Confucius. There is no need to discuss this in depth. From these few points, it is clear that Confucius is the greatest figure in Chinese history. His worthiness of our reverence and commemoration is also self-evident. However, what we cannot help but say is that although Confucius's character is great, his thought cannot escape the limitations of his time. The most obvious example is the policy of the Way of Kings, which emphasizes benevolence and righteousness and rejects force. It is very good to implement this within China, but it will certainly have no effect on the international stage, where the weak are prey to the strong. This is one point. Furthermore, Confucius's political ideal is a monarchical polity, which is not without conflict with the current system of the Republic of China. This is what we must pay special attention to when the authorities commemorate Confucius. In short, the thought of any great figure cannot escape the limitations of their time. Therefore, our worship must be rational worship, not blind worship. Furthermore, the key to our worship of great figures lies not in simply praising the ancients but in having the confidence to "see the worthy and think of emulating them."</p>

<p>Demonstration Held in Koblenz</p>
<p>140,000 People Submit Oaths of Loyalty to Hitler</p>
<p>(Koblenz) Today, people from the Saar and various parts of Germany came to Koblenz in an endless stream to participate in the massive Saar declaration of loyalty demonstration. Hitler and von Papen will both speak tomorrow to proclaim to the masses. The houses in the city are almost entirely filled with National Socialists. Imperial flags can be seen everywhere. There are currently more than 200 special trains transporting participants to the demonstration. These people will march from 6 a.m. tomorrow to the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress opposite Koblenz and gather in the square. In the past five days, 140,000 people have relayed oaths of loyalty from all parts of the country to the Saar. The oath from Rügen Island in Pomerania, across the Strelasund, was carried to the mainland by swimmers. The oath from Helgoland was carried by sailboat. The oath from the summit of the Zugspitze in Bavaria was carried down by mountain climbing experts. All oaths will be presented to Hitler at the demonstration. After the demonstration, 10,000 carrier pigeons will be released, followed by a bonfire and the lighting of lamps. The fortress was besieged by French troops in 1623 and 1688 without being taken. It was finally captured in 1799. After the Treaty of Lunéville, it was demolished. It was rebuilt by the Prussian government in 1816. (25th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, a large-scale propaganda campaign will be held near Koblenz at Ehrenbreitstein to demand that the Saar region be returned to Germany. Hitler, the "Leader and Chancellor," will personally participate and deliver a speech. This morning, German newspapers harshly criticized France's policies in the Saar region and the Saar Administrative Commission. The local newspaper stated, "The Saar region has suffered for fifteen years and will now return to Germany." The newspaper's wording was particularly harsh in its attacks on the League of Nations. The Catholic Party's Germania newspaper stated that if the Saar region's governance system remains as it is, it would be no different from being incorporated into France. Opponents of Hitler and advocates for maintaining the status quo in Saarbrücken demonstrated separately yesterday. Sympathizers of the National Socialist Party traveled to Koblenz by special train to participate in the "Movement to Return the Saar to Germany." The round-trip fare was originally 120 francs, but it was specially reduced to 20 francs. Several thousand unemployed people were also able to travel for free. (26th Havas)</p>

<p>For Publishing Anti-German Writings</p>
<p>(Berlin) The wife of the famous American novelist Sinclair Lewis (who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930) has been staying in Germany for several days. Recently, the authorities ordered her to leave the country, citing the reason that "Mrs. Lewis has expressed hostility towards the German political system." (25th Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Ms. Thompson, a prominent American journalist and wife of the famous novelist Sinclair, arrived here last week. Today, she was ordered by the secret police to leave Germany within 24 hours. The reason given was that Ms. Thompson had published many anti-German writings in American newspapers, and for the sake of national pride, she could not be allowed to continue to enjoy favorable treatment in Germany. It is said that the main reason for this order was a piece she wrote about her meeting with Hitler in 1932. Ms. Thompson told a Reuters interviewer that her writings had never stemmed from anti-German sentiments, so she found the actions of the German officials unfair. American journalists are now urging the American ambassador to Germany to negotiate with the German authorities on this matter. Ms. Thompson is the author of the book "Russia" and married Sinclair in 1928. (25th Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e81">The Actual Economic Situation in Japan (Japanese Correspondence) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Sericulture Plummets, Silk withers.</p>
<p>Rural Areas Decline, Farmers Suffer.</p>
<p>- Saitama Prefecture as an Example -</p>
<p>The so-called "prosperity" of Japanese society in general is actually a volatile "prosperity." Dumping exports and military industries are acts of "swelling the face to look fat." They do not greatly benefit the actual economic market. Although the Mitsubishi Economic Research Institute's survey of Japan's major industrial production indexes shows an increase, except for the raw silk industry, cotton yarn and cotton cloth can barely maintain a balance. Industries related to military affairs, such as coal, pig iron, steel manufacturing, and the chemical industry, are constantly increasing. Japanese industrial capitalists, especially the military clique, boast that the current economic situation is no less than that of the Soviet Union and has surpassed that of European and American countries. Therefore, they are striving to open up markets on the one hand and actively preparing for war on the other.</p>
<p>However, the facts show that the optimistic materials mentioned above are only a one-sided picture of brightness. Nowadays, in the cities, one cannot help but hear sighs about the difficulty of finding work, and hungry vagrants can be seen everywhere. In particular, since the spring cocoons were put on the market this year, silk prices have plummeted, falling to almost the same level as in 1932. The future is even worse than before because the manufacturing of rayon is becoming increasingly sophisticated, gradually taking over the market for raw silk. Furthermore, because the American market is still sluggish, such luxury goods will inevitably be the first to suffer. Therefore, Japanese raw silk exports are encountering rare misfortune.</p>
<p>Originally, Japan's rural economy had already encountered problems. The problem is overproduction. If rice prices fall, farmers are extremely distressed. The drop in cocoon prices makes income from sideline businesses equivalent to zero. Over the years, the total debt accumulated by rural villages across Japan amounts to as much as seven billion yen. Since 1930, it has been in a state of being frozen. Although there was a slight tendency to improve last year, this year's drought and floods have been significant and widespread, along with the following signs:</p>
<p>(1) This year's spring cocoon prices are low, similar to the year before. However, the summer and autumn cocoons of the year before gradually recovered their old prices. There is little hope for this year.</p>
<p>(2) Currently, rice prices are quite high. It is still unpredictable what will happen after the new rice comes onto the market. The only concern is that the climate this year is unfavorable. No matter what, there will be a reduction in the harvest. Even if rice prices rise, it will be a losing proposition.</p>
<p>(3) Rural fatigue is a chronic disease accumulated over many years. Currently, there are not only no fundamental solutions, but also the temporary mitigation measures are still unbearable for farmers. Moreover, whether the so-called rural countermeasures of the current Okada government can be effectively implemented is a big question. The deterioration of the rural situation is very worrying.</p>
<p>The above three situations are crises commonly acknowledged by Japanese society in general, and it is believed that they will inevitably affect the entire society. For example, the total debt of rural villages in Nagano Prefecture alone amounts to 250 million yuan. In fact, there is no other way but to postpone repayment. However, the Hypothec Bank of Japan and other financial institutions are pressured by the market's decline and cannot but pursue the repayment of debts. It is truly difficult to find a solution to this situation.</p>
<p>Another example is the famous Chichibu Town in Saitama Prefecture, a neighboring prefecture of Tokyo Prefecture, and Urayama Village, about nine miles away. Considering the location, it can be regarded as being at the foot of the emperor, a land of fish and rice. Although the transportation is not very convenient, it used to retain some primitive vestiges, a society of female rights. The words of a housewife were worth a thousand gold, and her "powers" were far greater than those of men. This is something rarely seen in Japan. However, recently, among the more than 250 households in Urayama Village, there are only three sick women who are virgins. The rest have abandoned their happiness and left the village to find hard labor because there is really no way to survive in the village. The rice harvested last year has been sold out. The money earned from selling cocoons this year is not enough to cover the costs, so there is no money to buy rice to eat. Most elementary school children cannot eat their fill. Many people have no rice to eat, and some even eat grass roots. For weddings, only two or three close relatives can be invited. There is absolutely no strength to entertain other guests. During the banquet, everyone drinks three cups as a token of good wishes, and there is no more wine to drink. Charcoal is produced in Mount Bukō in the area. Workers earn only eight yuan a month, but they have to support a family of five or six people. Each person earns only four or five sen (less than five cents in silver) per day. Therefore, elementary school children also take advantage of their summer vacation to carry charcoal in the mountains. They carry a bag of charcoal from the top of the mountain to the bottom, earning only three sen. Each child can earn twelve to eighteen sen per day. The predicament can be imagined. This village was not a particularly poor village in the past, but now it has become such a sight. There are many such places throughout Japan. In this situation, can it be said that it is not serious? (August 21, Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Japan Intensifies War Preparations Against Russia in the Northeast <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>= Active Military Action =</p>
<p>= The Soviet Union Responds Tightly =</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese army, due to the breakdown of negotiations with the Soviet puppet over the Chinese Eastern Railway, is actively making military arrangements in the Northeast. The Soviet Union is also making equal military preparations. The fellow countrymen in the Northeast, viewing this tense situation, with the pain of a lost province and the disaster of war, are panicked, as if a major catastrophe is about to come. The following is an exploration of the situation:</p>
<p>(Japanese Military Deployment) Recently, the situation in the Northeast between Japan and Russia has become increasingly tense. The Russian side is not only working hard to prepare for defense against Japan but also sending Communist Party members to the countryside to conduct anti-Japanese propaganda. The Japanese are building a large number of barracks and airfields along the major stations of the South Manchurian Railway. To the east of Gongzhuling Street, large barracks, arsenals, and marching headquarters have been built. To the north of the street, large airfields and bomb factories are being built. The project is extremely large, and thousands of workers are actively working on it. It is also rumored that Japanese-Russian military action will break out after the breakdown of negotiations on the "transfer" of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Wealthy families and merchants with sufficient capital here are all remitting money to Guan Nei (China proper) to avoid the ravages of war. This shows the degree of the swaying of the people's hearts. The strength of the Japanese army deployed in the Northeast and the recent state of its military equipment are listed below: (1) Two Japanese divisions are stationed in Suifenhe and Mudanjiang. The marching plan is to use Suifenhe as the first line of defense and Mudanjiang as the second line of defense. (2) Four Japanese divisions are stationed in Heihe and Longmen County, with Heihe as the first line of defense and Longmen County as the second line of defense. (3) Two Japanese divisions are stationed in Manzhouli and Hailar, and the main force seems to be strengthening Longmen. In addition, regarding the deployment of river defenses, a total of more than 30 defensive ships are gathered on the Songhua River, Heilongjiang River, and Ussuri River. Each ship is equipped with anti-aircraft installations (such as searchlights, anti-aircraft machine guns, and anti-aircraft guns). At the same time, one ship is carrying eight aircraft, currently docked at Xizhengyang River in Harbin. It is also heard that the Japanese fleet anchored in Shanghai will return to Lushun and Dalian in early September to strengthen its military strength in the Northeast. Furthermore, the Japanese army is paying particular attention to the transportation for marching. According to reports, between Lushun, Shenyang, Qiqihar, and Heihe, there is currently only a gap of 200 li that has not been connected by railway. Therefore, an extremely strong automobile road has been built in this section to facilitate military action. The Japanese also plan to build a military railway from Tumen River, through Yanji, Dongmi, and directly to Tongjiang, which will be planned and started soon.</p>
<p>The Japanese army has also set up an airfield at the former site of the Jiaotong Middle School in Siping Street, stationed with more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. In Bamiancheng, to the west of the railway station, a barracks has also been built that can accommodate more than 2,000 people. Currently, about several hundred Japanese soldiers are stationed there. The Japanese army has also built a large barracks to the north of the consulate on the west side of Liaoyuan County Railway Station, which can accommodate more than 3,000 people. Currently, about 400 Japanese soldiers are stationed there. There is an airfield to the east of the station where planes can land and refuel. A barracks has been built in Kaitong County, which can accommodate 500 people. The 4th Cavalry Brigade of the Japanese army and a squadron of aircraft are stationed in Taonan County. Recently, the Japanese army has purchased high-rise houses in the city and built a large barracks that can accommodate thousands of people. This place is the most important, and there are more Japanese troops stationed here. Baichengzi is located to the north of Taonan and is the starting point of the Tao-Suo Railway. The Japanese have built a large barracks and a large airfield here, each capable of accommodating a division. The situation here is very important for the connection between Outer Mongolia and "North Manchuria." Therefore, the Japanese military deployment here is quite complete. The Japanese closely monitor the residents in this area. All correspondence is subject to thorough investigation by the Japanese. Residents are often searched by Japanese military police and puppet police, and there is a risk of residents being arrested or harmed. Therefore, the people of Liaobei are extremely agitated and mostly join the work of the volunteer army.</p>
<p>(Russian Preparations) The Soviet Union, in view of Japan's eagerness to prepare for war, is also striving to strengthen its defensive equipment in the Far East. According to recent reliable intelligence, the Soviet Union has gathered 150,000 troops in the Heihe area, about 50,000 elite troops west of Suifenhe, and more than 70,000 Chinese and Korean volunteer soldiers. There are a total of 100,000 Red Army soldiers in the Manzhouli area. Solid fortifications have been built between Manzhouli and Suifenhe. More than 100 Russian planes practice in the airspace on the Northeast border every day. In addition, 60 to 70% of the volunteer armies east of Harbin also receive economic assistance from the Russian side, as well as a small number of new weapons. The most powerful of these is Zhao Shangzhi, who is currently in Bin County and enjoys the support of the people. In addition, similar volunteer armies also appear from time to time in the areas along the lower reaches of the river and the Harbin-Suifenhe line. According to the above situation, the Soviet Union not only has a strong military force of its own but also has the assistance of a large number of Chinese and Korean volunteer armies. Although Japan is actively plotting to attack the Soviet Union, it seems to have some concerns.</p>
<p>According to information from a certain party, in order to prepare for war against Japan and disrupt the Japanese army's rear, the Soviet Union has formed so-called suicide squads composed of Chinese, Russian, and Korean laborers and sent them to various parts of Manchuria. Li Qieou has now been appointed as the commander to form the suicide squads. It is heard that the Soviet Union first provides the suicide squads with six months of training in assassination, bomb use, and other methods, and then sends them to Manchuria to carry out activities.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Japanese Merchants in Java Oppose the Dutch East Indies <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Ceramic Restriction Law</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Declare a Strong Stance</p>
<p>Resisting by Suspending Exports</p>
<p>Batavia Special Dispatch: The Dutch-Japanese Conference is on the verge of collapse due to the implementation of the ceramic restriction law in the Dutch East Indies. Since both sides are still arranging their positions, hoping to make a final struggle, there has been no major development so far. At present, in addition to the Japanese Minister to the Netherlands, Takeyoshi Muto, negotiating with the Dutch Foreign Minister, Dirk de Graeff, the Japanese Foreign Minister, Koki Hirota, is also consulting with the Dutch Minister to Japan, Aart van Brienen. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict the outcome. However, all Japanese expatriates in the Dutch East Indies are extremely indignant about this. Japanese newspapers are strongly attacking the Dutch East Indies government's actions, calling them "atrocities" and "oppression." The representatives of Japan attending the Dutch-Japanese Conference have also made up their minds that if the Dutch side does not abolish this restriction law, the Dutch-Japanese Conference will have no other way to go except to break down. As for the Japanese merchants in the Dutch East Indies, they have also united. It is said that their purpose is to encourage the Japanese government and Japanese representatives to resist the measures of the Dutch East Indies government. Recently, seven major Japanese business groups in Java issued a statement, which reads: The Java Ceramic Importers Association was initiated by Japanese merchants, and Chinese merchants gladly participated. The four major Dutch merchants had originally agreed to join, but when the Dutch-Japanese Conference started, they overturned the previous agreement and suddenly announced that they refused to participate. The Dutch East Indies government, under the pretext of stabilizing the market and promoting coexistence and co-prosperity between Japan and the Netherlands, and this importers association, issued an import restriction order for this commodity. This is a misinterpretation of the people's cooperation. Moreover, the issuance of this restriction order is actually the prelude to the full implementation of the restriction orders for 56 commodities in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, whether the Dutch-Japanese Conference can succeed depends on whether this restriction order can be revoked. (Omission) Now, the Japanese government is doing its best to revoke this restriction order. In order to support the government's measures and promote the resolution of this case by the Japan Ceramic Exporters Association Federation, we advocate prohibiting exports to Java to promote the Dutch East Indies' reflection. This is a necessary and urgent matter, and we hope that they can adopt our opinions. The signatories are the All-Java Japanese Miscellaneous Goods Importers Association League, the All-Java Japanese Retailers Association League, the Surabaya Business Association, the Batavia Business Association, the Semarang Business Association, the Bandung Business Association, and the Java Ceramic Importers Association and other groups.</p>
<p>The Batavia Japanese Business Association held a meeting because the Dutch East Indies government adopted high-pressure tactics against Japan. The main points of its resolutions are as follows: This restriction order of the Dutch East Indies government is not just a single problem of ceramics. If this restriction order is not revoked, then other restrictions will inevitably be implemented one after another in the future. Therefore, this matter must be fought for.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Surabaya Japanese Business Association also decided to take the same attitude and sent a telegram to the Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry, with quite strong wording. The main points of the telegram are as follows: Regarding the Dutch East Indies government's attempt to exclude Japanese goods and the revocation of the anti-Japanese goods order, we trust the plenipotentiary representatives to expect their results. Now, the Dutch East Indies government suddenly issued a discriminatory law on the import of ceramics. Regarding the immediate revocation of the violent law, we believe that the plenipotentiary representatives will take urgent measures. In order to protect the rights of Japanese merchants, we are willing to sacrifice everything and decided to suspend business. We hope that merchants in Japan will immediately stop exporting before the revocation of this restriction law. The outcome of this matter will be a touchstone for various commodities in the future. If this unity fails this time, it will be taken advantage of by the Dutch East Indies. It will be difficult to protect the rights of Japanese merchants thereafter. Judging from the attitudes of the Japanese merchants in the above two places, the intensity of Japan's opposition to the ceramic restriction law promulgated by the Dutch East Indies government this time can be seen. However, their weapons of opposition are "embargo" and "not selling." This kind of method, whether it can make the Dutch side yield, although the Japanese merchants have this confidence, it is difficult to be optimistic from our perspective. The ceramic products imported into the Dutch East Indies are not only from Japan. Even if Japanese merchants in the Dutch East Indies can prohibit the import of their own country's ceramic products into the Dutch East Indies, how can they prohibit the import of ceramic products from other countries?</p>
<h3 id="e84">Yu and Yellow Qinhai River Project <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Chen Ruzhen's Inspection Report</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Chen Ruzhen, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, crossed the river from Taoyuankou on the morning of the 16th with Tao, a technician, to inspect the recent situation of the Yellow River's north bank and the Qinhai River project. He returned to Bian yesterday morning. The following is a record of his report: "Yellow River" (1) In the northern flood of Kaifeng, the top of the No. 3 dam of the 19th fort was heavily eroded. It collapsed two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters) on the 13th of this month. Stones are being thrown to extend it. Fortunately, the tip of the second spur has not sunk below the water surface. Stones have been thrown on it together with the collapsed parts of the fifth and sixth spurs to resist the water. However, it is difficult to obtain soil in this flood area. The top surface of the levee has been raised by about one meter this time. With the recent sharp rise in water, a sub-levee has been built on the side facing the river, which is one meter higher than the new levee. The entire flood area has been completed by 80%. There will be no danger even if the water rises again in the future. (2) In the northern flood of Kai-Chen, from the 20th fort of the northern flood of Kaifeng to the 2nd fort of this flood area, all the dams are made of stone. There has been no erosion after this flood. However, on the levee surface of the 1st to 3rd forts, after heavy rain, many flood nests were found, and there was also a large nest spanning the levee. Workers have been hired to fill them. The levees below the 2nd fort are all level ground. The levee north of this flood area is low, and the land is mostly saline-alkali. During the last flood, the area below Xibatou was already overflowing due to the lack of levees. Fortunately, the overflowing water carried silt and did not cause great harm. (3) The Yang, Feng, Yuanyang, and Wu Rong flood areas are all level ground. The maintenance and construction of the dikes are still good this time. (4) In the Wuzhi flood area, the main stream eroded the levee near Fangling. Stones have been thrown to protect it, so there is no need to worry. The 9th and 12th dams of the 9th fort collapsed by 4 zhang on the 10th. New stones were used day and night to protect it. As of the 17th, more than 3,000 cubic meters of stone have been thrown. The dam is directly facing the connecting gully, and the downstream swift current is directly hitting it. If the new stones were not sufficient, it would not have been protected. The area above and below the mouth of the Qin River is extremely dangerous and unimaginable. The new levee north of the two Yan Villages under Jiabu was heavily eroded by the main stream. The levee collapsed by more than 30 zhang. More than 6,000 willows were planted on the 16th, and two stone spurs were thrown. It is not very safe. An order was issued to send workers to throw stones to protect the levee foundation. "Qin River" (1) In the Renxiao Temple and Zhongxian Xubao projects, there was erosion between the old levees in Renxiao and Zhongxian. They are being reinforced. The current in Xubao is approaching the levee, and the old levee has been eroded. Fortunately, the project still has materials in reserve. An order was issued to quickly reinforce it to avoid further collapse. (2) The Shantai project is a level ground project. On the 16th of this month, the current suddenly shifted to the gate of the project, and the old beach collapsed almost completely. The levee foundation collapsed by more than ten zhang. The levee encircling the gate has collapsed, and the gate has also collapsed in two places. There are no materials locally, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Although more than 140 willows have been planted to reduce the scouring force, the levee is still collapsing as of the evening of the 17th. An urgent telegram was sent to the Shangbei Branch to transport the 4,000 sacks of hemp and the 200 cubic meters of new stones currently in the Wenwu flood area to the Xiqin construction site overnight for use. The current was still extremely dangerous on the morning of the 18th. More than ten willows were added to stabilize it slightly. Fearing that the stone boats would go upstream too slowly, an order was issued to purchase 20,000 bricks nearby, load them into bags, and throw them for protection instead of stone. (3) In the Hongqiao project, the current is approaching the levee, and the old beach above the old levee is collapsing rapidly. Only about one zhang of the old beach is left under the levee, and the situation is extremely dangerous. An order was issued to quickly purchase materials to protect it. (4) There is erosion in the levee section of the Baishui County Village and Yangzhuang projects. They are being reinforced separately. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Rural Relief Plan in Guangdong Province <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>- Program Prepared by the Political Research Association -</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial authorities held a special tariff on the import of foreign rice at the end of last year. The original purpose was to curb the dumping of foreign rice, maintain rural production, and at the same time use this to obtain a sum of money to subsidize rural construction. Since the implementation of this special tariff, the monthly income has been more than one million yuan, which has greatly benefited the provincial treasury. Chen Jitang, Chairman of the Guangdong Political Research Association, proposed to the association that the Guangdong Provincial Government should allocate 5 million yuan from the income of the foreign rice tax to carry out rural relief undertakings in order to comply with government regulations. The association forwarded the proposal to Feng Rui, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, to prepare a concrete plan for review. Feng, upon receiving the order, has prepared ten urgent plans based on the current situation of rural villages in the province, along with a budget, and submitted them to the association. The contents of the plan are summarized as follows: (A) Principles (1) To relieve the current urgent needs of farmers, so that the majority of farmers can obtain universal benefits, so as to increase the economic strength of rural villages and the country. (2) The relief work should be based on promoting the modernization of agricultural production, increasing the productivity of individuals and the productivity of land, and improving the quality of products. (3) The funds used for rural relief can be gradually returned from the relief undertakings and then used to develop other economic undertakings in rural villages. (B) Measures (1) Construction of urgently needed farmland water conservancy in various places. (2) Prevention and control of cattle plague throughout the province. (3) Establishment of various important agricultural management areas suitable for local conditions. (4) Development of tropical economic forestry. (5) Undertaking camphor management. (6) Establishment of a Huashui Mountain forest management field. (7) Construction of the Dongjiang River source forest. (8) Increasing rice production. (9) Breeding excellent livestock breeds. (10) Completing the farmer lending organization. (C) Budget, summarizing the above ten items, the temporary start-up cost is 4,068,264 yuan, and the annual recurring cost is 931,736 yuan. The total of temporary and recurring costs is 5,000,000 yuan. (Correspondent of this newspaper, Gan Fangxian)</p>

<p>The county government received instructions from the Department of Finance yesterday, pointing out the points that should be improved regarding the deed tax and the promotion of transfers, stating briefly that, according to the report of the investigators, the two best points for handling deed tax collection in Jiangyin County (1) The review procedures for promoting transfer should be handled as soon as possible. The official seal form can be obtained on the same day, which reduces the trouble for the villagers and is considered convenient. (2) On the mortgage deed, a wooden chop is added to separately list the regular tax, surtax, official seal form fee, etc., which is convenient for not only the staff to calculate but also for the deed owner to check and avoid the drawbacks of floating collection. After receiving the order, County Chief Jin instructed the donation collection office to comply.</p>

<p>Dai, the wife of Wang Shican, the owner of the Wang Xiecheng wood shop in Shuyuan Lane in the city, was about thirty years old. She was romantic and had an affair with a neighbor, Zhang. Recently, she suddenly became pregnant, so she colluded with her lover and husband to have an abortion. The day before yesterday, she went to the midwife Su Wang in Luosijing near Dongting Town to undergo surgery. Unexpectedly, due to the unsuccessful operation, she suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain and unstoppable bleeding. She died in less than five minutes. Afterwards, the news spread throughout the town. The head of the 554th Tu, upon hearing the news, believed that the case involved human life and planned to report it to the court for an examination. He also had someone watch the midwife and notified her husband, Wang Shican, to return home. However, it is heard that the matter has now been settled through mediation by the midwife and Wang Shican has petitioned the court to waive the examination.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been dry and there has been no rain, making it increasingly difficult for farmers in the four villages to draw water. On the night of the day before yesterday (25th), there was thunder and lightning, and the situation was tense, as if it was about to rain. As a result, no rain fell, causing great disappointment. In recent days, the water level of Taihu Lake has been lowering daily, leveling with the water level of the Grand Canal. There is even a danger of rivers drying up in various tributaries. In the 3rd district, the villagers in Xinan Township south of Xinan Town, including Zhenqiaobang, Zhangzhushibang, Xutaocijingbang, Xiaolongjing, Dabaillongqiao, Xiaobaillongqiao, and Xucaiheqiao, have built dams at both ends of each river in the Taihu Lake direction and the Grand Canal direction to draw water into the rivers and then pump it into the fields in order to save the drought. In the 5th district, the crops in Qianzhou, Beiqifang, and Fuzhou Village have withered due to the difficulty of drawing water, and all the small boats on the inland rivers have also stopped running. There is a panic about drinking water in the urban area, and the authorities are planning to remedy it.</p>

<p>Wuyi has suffered from severe drought this year, with little rainfall. Since autumn, there has been no rain at all, causing extreme anxiety among the villagers and creating social unrest. Yesterday (the 25th) at 4:00 PM, dark clouds gathered and a sudden rainstorm occurred, lasting for about twenty minutes before stopping. Although it did not solve the problem, it did provide some consolation. Also, near the train station, the kiln owners He Niangeng and his brother Niansheng were both struck by lightning at the time. After rescue efforts, Niangeng was fortunate enough to regain consciousness, but Niansheng could not be revived.</p>

<p>In Zhongnan Township, the first district of Qidong, a farmer named Zhang Guorong suffered from mental illness for many years, with alternating episodes of illness and recovery. The day before yesterday afternoon, the family was working in the fields when Zhang's illness suddenly recurred. He locked the doors and used kerosene to set the house on fire. Thick smoke quickly filled the air, and flames soared. By the time the neighbors noticed, it was too late to help. The three thatched houses where he lived, as well as his belongings, were completely burned down, and Zhang died in the fire, his skin charred and flesh rotten, a truly tragic sight.</p>

Due to the seriousness of the case, onlookers were prohibited. As a result, Zhang Guirong and Jin Zhigao were detained, while Dai Chengzhang was released on bail.</p>

<p>Shen Zhenxing, Hengchang, Gongmaoxing, and other rice shops in the South Village of Xincheng Town, Jiaxing, used boats on the afternoon of the 25th to transport large quantities of rice for sale elsewhere. When the boats were transported to the countryside, hungry villagers spotted them and gathered to loot the rice. When the Xincheng Town police heard the news, they went to suppress the looting. The hungry villagers refused to listen to their warnings, so the police fired warning shots, causing a farmer to fall to the ground after being hit by a bullet. The police then returned to the town. The villagers, because someone had been injured, swarmed to the town in the hundreds. They were dispersed after local figures persuaded them. It is now known that Shen Zhenxing had more than ninety dan of rice looted, while Hengchang and Gongmaoxing each had thirty to forty dan looted.</p>

<p>Sun Yuangui and other farmers in Xiaoshan's Fourth District, Xiaohu Sun area, built a dam to draw water to irrigate their fields. The Xu family in the neighboring village objected, claiming it affected their drinking water, leading to a fight between the two families. On the 20th, more than a thousand people from the two villages gathered, firing blunderbusses and cannons at random, intending to level each other's villages. Women and children fled in terror, as if facing a major enemy. Fortunately, the Linpu Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and went to suppress it, bringing the situation under control.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Guangde: Severe Drought in Guangde, Southern Anhui <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Guangde is located on the edge of southern Anhui, bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The county's main products are grain and rice, along with bamboo, timber, charcoal, and Sanliu writing paper. The entire area is surrounded by mountains and not far from the sea, so it has never experienced major droughts or floods. Since the Red Bandits ravaged the area in 1929, the rural economy has collapsed. The average annual harvest is only 60% of what it used to be, and the farmers' suffering is indescribable. Fortunately, in recent years, the rainfall during the planting season has been relatively good, so there has been no need to draw water for transplanting rice, and the fields have not been abandoned. This year, the rainfall was also adequate in late spring and early summer, but since the seventh day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, more than one hundred days have passed without rain. The drought is severe, bamboo and trees have withered, the ground is scorched yellow, and livestock lack pasture. A few areas have received one or two light rains, but they have been insufficient. The damage to paddy fields can be divided into three categories: (1) About 10% of the fields could not be planted because there was no water to draw at the time of transplanting. (2) About 20% of the fields were irrigated but will only yield 10-20% of the harvest if sufficient rain falls within days. (3) The remaining 70% will have no harvest at all. As for dry land, soybeans and other grains were planted three times but failed to germinate. Under the current economic conditions, farming families resort to pawning and borrowing whenever it is time to plant, hoping to make a small income to make ends meet. This disaster has left them completely hopeless. Now, the healthy ones are taking their families to beg for food elsewhere, and suicides among the elderly and weak are heard of daily. Cunning individuals are robbing and looting food, or stealing unripe dry rice under cover of darkness. People are panicking to the extreme. According to the elderly, such a severe drought has not been seen since 1856, more than eighty years ago.</p>

<p>The National Economic Commission's Silk Improvement Committee, seeking to revive the silk industry in Shandong Province, sent Commissioner He Shangping and Technical Specialist Wang Jiayou from Shanghai via Qingdao last month to visit Mayor Shen and then travel to Jinan to meet with Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu and Construction Department Director Zhang Honglie to discuss relief measures. Chairman Han and Director Zhang both agreed that the silk industry urgently needed relief. He and Wang learned in detail about the silk industry situation in Shandong from repeatedly reports by silk expert Cai Renbao. Furthermore, Cai is the son of silk magnate Cai Cimu and has rich experience in the silk industry. Cai was still in Shandong, so they visited him and discussed the matter in detail. They decided to invite Cai to assist in inspecting various places. At the beginning of the month, Cai returned south for personal matters and met with Standing Committee members Zeng Yangfu and He Shangping to discuss new silkworm rearing test methods. It was decided to send personnel to Shandong to bring seeds and provide guidance, and the committee sent a letter to the Shandong Construction Department in advance to make arrangements. It is now learned that Lv Yicheng and Xia Chubai, the technicians sent by the committee to guide the new silkworm rearing, departed from the Zhejiang Silk Improvement Association with the new silkworm seeds the day before yesterday and arrived in Jinan. In the morning, they visited Director Zhang Honglie and First Section Chief Zhu Guixun of the Construction Department to make arrangements. It was decided that they would go to Linqu yesterday to guide the trial rearing. The equipment and assistants will be provided by Dai Guanxun, director of the Yidu Sericulture Experiment Station, and Chen Shican, a technician from the Construction Department, will be responsible for distributing the silkworm seeds. The fresh cocoons produced in the future will be purchased at high prices to encourage the industry. Lv and Xia visited Cai's residence, accompanied by Mr. Zhao Songbi and Xu Baohua, because Lv and Xia were instructed by the standing committee members Zeng, He, Ge, and Zhang to consult with Cai on methods at any time. After the talks, Cai fell ill due to fatigue from traveling, so Zhao Songbi and Xu Baohua accompanied them to visit the scenic Daming Lake and hosted a banquet to welcome them. In addition to instructing the Yidu Sericulture Experiment Station to cooperate, the Construction Department will also send Technician Chen to Yidu yesterday to proceed to Linqu and begin work.</p>

<h3 id="e103">City Temperature <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Slightly Lower Than Yesterday</p>
<p>Hope for an Early and Abundant Rain</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn in the city, the daily temperature has generally been around 100 degrees. On the 24th, it rose to 100 degrees, and on the 25th, it suddenly rose to 104 degrees, the highest autumn temperature recorded by the Observatory in 63 years. Although it was sunny and hot yesterday, the north wind brought relief, so the highest temperature dropped to 99.5 degrees, which seemed slightly cooler than the previous two days. However, the drought has been prolonged, and there is no sign of rain. Drinking water sources in various places are drying up, farmland is cracking, epidemics are spreading, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. It is hoped that Heaven will have pity on the common people and send abundant rain soon, which may still provide a glimmer of hope for salvation.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Shanghai Fishing Industry Plans to Establish <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>National Marine Products Company</p>
<p>Preparatory Office Located on Limalu Road in the Sixteenth Concession</p>
<p>Shanghai fishing industry magnates Zhou Wangyue, Jin Chuxiang, and others, recognizing the decline of China's fishing industry and the opportunistic encroachment by the Japanese, with annual imports of marine products reaching a staggering 40 million yuan, are planning to raise 500,000 yuan in Shanghai to establish a large-scale marine products company to develop the fishing industry and recover lost rights. The preparations are currently underway, and the company is expected to be formally established within the year. A reporter from China Eastern News Agency visited the company's preparatory office on Limalu Road in the Sixteenth Concession yesterday to learn the details, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(500,000 Yuan to Establish Company) The company will be named "National Marine Products Co., Ltd.," with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It has already obtained the support of the majority of the Shanghai fishing industry and has submitted an application to the Ministry of Industry for record. After reviewing the application, the Ministry of Industry found that it was in line with the salt-fishing manufacturing plant planned in the Ministry's four-year fishing industry plan and approved its promotion. Preparations are now underway to formally establish the company and begin operations within this year.</p>
<p>(Scope of Business) The company's scope of business is roughly divided into the following four items: (1) Establishing marine product manufacturing plants in four important fishing areas along the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang: Shengshan, Sijiao, Daishan, and Zhoushan, to enable cooperation between fishermen; (2) Owning gasoline transport ships to collect catches from fishing boats and transport fresh goods; (3) Establishing a natural ice factory and warehouses; (4) Organizing fishing cooperative societies, etc. In the future, the company plans to purchase fishing vessels to engage in fishing and shellfish farming to increase production, depending on the development of the business. The total annual turnover is expected to be over 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>(Surveying the Annual Yield of Fishing Grounds) The company believes that in order to develop this industry, it must first understand the fishing situation. It has conducted extensive surveys in various coastal fishing areas, including Xiangshan, Zhenhai, Taizhou, Wenzhou, Shengshan, Sijiao, and Daishan. According to statistics, the annual output is approximately 1.6 million dan of yellow croaker, over 570,000 dan of large yellow croaker, approximately 300,000 dan of black seabream, over 360,000 dan of ribbonfish, and approximately 200,000 dan of jellyfish skin. Other fish such as shark, pomfret, reeves shad, mussels, whitebait, and seaweed also have detailed statistics.</p>
<p>(Improving the Plan, First Establish Manufacturing Plants) In order to improve the fishing industry easily and meet needs, the company decided to start with the establishment of marine product manufacturing plants. It has hired specialized personnel to conduct research. Within the manufacturing plants, there are separate departments for salting fish, drying fish, and canning fish. All products are refined using scientific methods to ensure that they last a long time and are properly seasoned. A fishing boat affairs agency is also attached to supply fishermen with various needs, so that fishermen can reduce the burden, focus on fishing, and promote the benefits of marine products.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Report from Shanghai Municipal Council's Rates Office <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Index of Vacant Houses Increases</p>
<p>Mr. MacFee, acting director of the Finance Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Bourne, deputy director and head of the tax division, released the summer housing tax statistics for this year, which amounted to 2,638,866 yuan, an increase of 210,092 yuan compared to the same period last year. However, one notable statistic is the increasing number of vacant houses. In the summer of 1932, there were 1,292 Western-style vacant houses and 3,395 Chinese-style vacant houses in the International Settlement. By the summer of last year (1933), this had increased to 1,453 Western-style vacant houses and 4,153 Chinese-style vacant houses. This summer, the number of vacant houses has further increased to 1,859 Western-style vacant houses and 4,424 Chinese-style vacant houses. The vacant houses in the northern and southern districts and the French Concession are not included. The economic downturn is evident.</p>

<p>Although They Have Passports, They Are Not Signed</p>
<p>The Ship is Under the Guard of the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, nine Russians, including one woman, reportedly fled from Vladivostok in a motor tugboat. They encountered a storm north of Jeju Island and were in danger, but were rescued by the islanders on August 16. They claimed to have fled to Shanghai because of the oppression of the Vladivostok police authorities. The captain, Mr. Pisorov, claimed to be an American citizen, and the woman on board was said to be his wife. After repairing the engine, they continued to Shanghai, arriving at noon on Saturday (the 25th), thirteen days after fleeing Vladivostok. When the ship arrived at Wusong Port, it was thoroughly searched by the water police. Two pistols, one rifle, and one giant sword were reportedly found. Although the people carried Soviet passports, they were not signed by the appropriate officials and they did not have ship manifests. The people have requested permission to reside in Shanghai, and this matter will be decided by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The ship is currently under the guard of the Wusong Port Public Security Bureau, and the people remain on board. It is expected that the local Soviet authorities will lodge a protest and request that the people be detained and that the ship be seized as Soviet property.</p>

<p>To Invade Our Country's Territorial Waters and Fishing Rights</p>
<p>The Future is Unimaginable if We Do Not Fight for It This Time</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Japanese fishing industry has recently developed a new plan to send sixty-eight fishing vessels west at the beginning of next month for a systematic and complete invasion. According to someone, the conspiracy of the Dahua Fishing Vessel Company organized by the Japanese has been exposed, resulting in huge losses. Furthermore, because invading China's territorial waters cannot be achieved with only five or six fishing vessels, they are coming in anger. If our government authorities and fishing industry colleagues do not rise up and fight for it, the future is unimaginable. Furthermore, considering the fishermen in our country's territorial waters, there are more than 1.2 million in the seven coastal provinces. If they become pirates due to unemployment, the future maritime security is also bleak.</p>

<p>Telegrams to Zhejiang Provincial Government Requesting Investigation of Disaster in Huzhou - Guizhou Road</p>
<p>The Lake Society has received successive reports from hometowns in the six counties of Huzhou, stating that the disaster situation is extremely serious and that the people are scattered and displaced, a truly tragic sight. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting that personnel be dispatched to investigate the actual disaster situation, distinguish between the severity of the situation, reduce or exempt land taxes, and postpone the collection of old debts. In addition, rivers and canals should be dredged to provide work relief. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, this summer has been severely dry, and there has been no rain in the autumn. The lakes and ponds have dried up, the fields have cracked, the crops have withered, and the harvest is disappointing. Successive reports have been received from hometowns in the six counties of the old Huzhou region, stating that the disaster situation is extremely serious. It is sincerely requested that personnel be dispatched quickly to investigate the actual disaster situation, distinguish between the severity of the situation, reduce or exempt land taxes, and postpone the collection of old debts. In addition, rivers and canals should be dredged to provide work relief, and measures should be taken to provide relief, hoping to alleviate the suffering. The telegram is sent with the utmost urgency. Respectfully, Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society."</p>
<p>Telegram to Wuxing County Magistrate Requesting Relief for People's Drinking Water. Because the river channels have dried up, the drinking water is polluted, and diseases are spreading, the Lake Society sent a telegram to the Wuxing County Magistrate, urging him to hire more civilian boats and laborers to transport water from places such as Yixi Bridge outside the South Gate of Huzhou, Datong Bridge outside the North Gate, and Longxikou outside the West Gate to the city to provide drinking water for the people. Each load may charge the lowest shipping fee to subsidize and emphasize public health.</p>

All of the wheat flour has been purchased by domestic flour manufacturers. This year's drought has resulted in poor harvests of agricultural products in various places, causing food shortages. Therefore, flour prices are also soaring. Before February, the selling price was 1.9 yuan per bag, but now it must be sold for 2.65 yuan. The flour manufacturers who purchased the American wheat flour are all making huge profits. Although more than 100,000 bales of American cotton have been sold by Fulyen &amp; Co. to foreign merchants, there are currently 120,000 bales remaining unsold. The government plans to sell them to Chinese spinning mills, but the mills are considering whether the price of new cotton is cost effective, because this year's cotton production in China, according to the Cotton Statistics Association's survey and forecast, is more abundant than in previous years. The seeds for the American cotton grown in Shaanxi and Jiangsu are long and thick. The new cotton from Tongzhou, Jiangsu, has already entered the market, and other provinces will also produce cotton in mid-September. Although American cotton can be spun into fine yarn, if the price is too high compared to the price of domestic cotton, it will be difficult for cotton mills to purchase American cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Central Government Approves Zhejiang to Issue a 20 Million Yuan Public Bond <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Zeng Yangfu Comes to Shanghai to Discuss Mortgages</p>
<p>Preliminary Agreement Reached</p>
<p>The World News Agency reports that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, facing severe drought and crop failure this year, urgently needs to provide relief to farmers. Due to insufficient funds in the provincial treasury, the provincial government decided to issue 20 million yuan in local public bonds. They drafted regulations and submitted them to the Central Government for approval. Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Reconstruction, traveled to Shanghai and then to Nanjing to present the severity of the disaster to the Central Government, arguing that issuing public bonds was the only way to ensure proper post-disaster recovery and urging for Central Government approval. The issuance of these bonds has now been approved by the Executive Yuan, pending subsequent ratification by the Legislative Yuan. Zeng, having completed his official duties in Nanjing, left Nanjing for Shanghai with President Wang and others the day before yesterday, specifically to negotiate mortgage matters with the financial community in Shanghai. Since arriving in Shanghai, Zeng has been busy negotiating with various parties. It is expected that a syndicate will be formed by the Bank of China, Jin Cheng Bank, Bank of Communications, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank to underwrite the bonds. However, due to Saturday and Sunday being official bank holidays, the details of the mortgage procedures and interest rates have not yet been finalized. Zeng emphasizes the severity of the disaster in Zhejiang Province and the urgent need to complete a portion of highway construction. Therefore, the mortgage of these public bonds needs to be negotiated as soon as possible to remit funds to Zhejiang for use. Consequently, further discussions with leading figures in the banking community are scheduled for today to determine the specific arrangements. (According to the Da Bai News Agency, he returned to Hangzhou on the 25th and will come to Shanghai again to complete the formalities.)</p>

<p>Refuses Local Rice Merchants to Purchase Shanghai Rice</p>
<p>Remaining 3,000 Bags Stored in Shanghai to be Shipped Within Days</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reports that the Jiangxi Provincial Government, in order to stabilize local rice prices, has purchased 15,000 bags of Hunan and Anhui "small roller" rice from Shanghai in three batches. Local rice merchants have repeatedly requested to purchase this rice to manipulate prices, but their requests have been rejected by the authorities. At the same time, fearing that unscrupulous merchants might hoard rice, the government has temporarily stockpiled it in warehouses to suppress prices during periods of high inflation. Since rice prices in Shanghai have also risen, further purchases have been suspended. The remaining 3,000 bags from the previous shipment are scheduled to be shipped within days, and the 8,000 bags of rice scheduled for September will be shipped by the end of September.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Ministry of Railways Order <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Rectify Joint Transportation on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway</p>
<p>Attract Cargo Heading North to Avoid Empty Cars Returning</p>
<p>Capital Ferry Crosses the River with a Load of 4,000 Tons</p>
<p>To improve the operations of the capital ferry, the Ministry of Railways ordered the operating hours of the ferry to be increased from twelve to twenty hours to increase the capacity for transporting goods across the river. To find ways to increase the number of vehicles crossing the river and improve the efficiency of the ferry, the Ministry specifically ordered the Nanjing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou Railways to rectify joint transportation of freight cars across the river. The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway was also ordered to make efforts to attract cargo for joint transportation heading north to avoid empty cars returning. The original order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Joint Transportation of Goods) Is developing rapidly. More than 60,000 tons of goods are accumulated at stations along the line awaiting transportation. To clear the accumulated goods, the ferry was ordered to add staff and operate extra shifts. The third step must be to increase the number of vehicles crossing the river for the plan to achieve full results. At present, there are only about 200 freight cars in Tianjin-Pukou and only about 130 in Nanjing-Shanghai that meet the conditions for joint transportation across the river. Therefore, the maximum amount of goods crossing the river daily from north to south is no more than 2,400 tons, and from south to north, it is even less, only several hundred tons. The transportation capacity is limited. The majority of other freight cars in Nanjing-Shanghai either have weak springs or low hooks. In Tianjin-Pukou, many cars lack air brakes and are not repaired, resulting in them not meeting the conditions for crossing the river. This causes the joint transportation of goods to be stockpiled at stations without being able to be transported. How can the efficiency of the ferry crossing the river be expanded if the number of vehicles crossing the river is limited? It is useless. The Ministry specifically orders the two railway bureaus to</p>
<p>(Undertake Rectification) The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway should replace the springs of in-service vehicles or raise the hooks. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway should repair the vehicles. By taking this measure, the number of tons of cargo will greatly increase, and the ferry's revenue will reach its highest point, which would be enough to repay the principal and interest. Furthermore, there is too little cargo transported by the Beijing-Hankou Railway from south to north, resulting in many joint transportation vehicles heading south returning empty on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, which is uneconomical. The Beijing-Hankou Railway should make efforts to attract joint transportation of goods heading north</p>
<p>(To Develop Further) Also, the daily transportation limit of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is no more than 3,200 tons, while the ferry, after improvement, can transport 4,000 tons across the river, with 800 tons of carrying capacity remaining. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway should attract several hundred tons of coal transport to supplement the load. Even if it cannot be transported to Shanghai and Hangzhou, it should at least be able to be transported across the river by ferry to Nanjing. The above items should be followed by the two railway bureaus and completed by the deadline. Plans should be made within ten days after receiving the order to implement this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e117">China and Shanghai Banks Jointly Form <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Agricultural Product Warehouse Loan Syndicate</p>
<p>Eight Major Agricultural Product Warehouses Established Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Syndicate Responsible for Handling Mortgage Loans</p>
<p>Hunan is a well-known rice-producing region in China, with a large amount of rice shipped to the Yangtze River basin and Shanghai and Fujian each year. In recent years, due to frequent disasters, farmers have become increasingly impoverished, and there is a complete lack of warehousing facilities. In the event of floods or droughts, crop failures occur, and people have no way to survive. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, deeply affected by this year's floods and droughts, feels that without large-scale warehousing, it is impossible to maintain the rural economy. Therefore, he drafted the Hunan Cotton Industry Experiment Field Agricultural Product Warehouse Plan and Warehouse Mortgage Loan Measures, which were discussed by Yu Jifu, Director of the Department of Reconstruction, Zhang Kailian, Director of the Department of Finance, Yuan Zhongkui, Director of the Cotton Industry Experiment Field, and Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China in Shanghai, and Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, to negotiate investment loans. A rough agreement has now been reached to form the "Agricultural Product Warehouse Loan Bank" jointly by the Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank. Lu Zhiting and Li Jingtao have been specifically assigned to be responsible for the handling in Hunan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Purpose of the Warehouse) Warehousing in China was established very early. During the Warring States period, Li Kui's price-balancing method existed. In the mid-Western Han dynasty, the Ever-Normal Granary system emerged. Other systems, such as community granaries and charity granaries, existed throughout the dynasties. However, to this day, they have all been abolished. The only way to remedy this is to refer to the old Ever-Normal Granary system and new cooperative regulations and to establish rural warehouses in conjunction with news agencies so that farmers can obtain funds for emergency needs without having to sell their products at low prices. Moreover, warehouses can purchase food at fair prices to regulate supply and demand. In the event of unexpected national events, they can also provide emergency relief. The provincial government and the financial community jointly plan to build warehouses throughout the province and set up factories in areas with convenient transportation for processing to be sold directly to farmers by cooperatives, eliminating the exploitation of merchants.</p>
<p>(Regional Establishment) The province now plans to divide the province's abundant agricultural areas into eight regions, each with a regional warehouse in the transportation center of each region, with a syndicate-designated office inside. Sub-warehouses will be established in each city and town in the region, and branch warehouses will be established in small rural towns as needed. The plan is as follows: (1) Jinshi District, under the jurisdiction of Lixian, Anxiang, and Linli; (2) Changde District, under the jurisdiction of Changde, Taoyuan, and Hanshou; (3) Yiyang District, under the jurisdiction of Yiyang and Yuanjiang; (4) Nanhua District, under the jurisdiction of Nanxian and Huarong; (5) Yueyang District, under the jurisdiction of Yueyang, Linxiang, and Pingjiang; (6) Jinggang District, under the jurisdiction of Changsha, Ningxiang, Xiangyin, and Liuyang; (7) Zhuzhou District, under the jurisdiction of Xiangtan, Liling, Youxian, Hengshan, and Xiangxiang; (8) Hengyang District, under the jurisdiction of Hengyang, Laiyang, Qiyang, Changning, and Anren. As for the construction costs, regional and sub-warehouses will be provided by the provincial treasury, while branch warehouses will be raised by the local area. Warehouse management and maintenance costs will be provided by warehouse rental income.</p>
<p>(Syndicate Loans) The loan method has been agreed upon by the Hunan Provincial Government and the syndicate and has been submitted to the Provincial Government meeting for approval. The reporter from the Shenshi News Agency has learned that the main provisions of its contents are as follows: (1) The agricultural products pledged in the warehouse are temporarily limited to five types: rice, cotton seeds, broad beans, soybeans, and wheat. (2) Warehouse loans will first be offered to cooperative farmers in the Hunan Agricultural Experiment Field and then gradually extended to other farmers. (3) The agricultural products pledged in the warehouse are limited to the products produced by each farmer, ranging from one dan to one hundred dan, which will be accepted. Those who sell and hoard will not be accepted. (4) The loan interest rate should be low. The tentative rate is one percent per month, with one mill extracted from it as the warehouse reserve fund, and the rest goes to the investing syndicate. (5) The pledged agricultural products must be paid for insurance premiums, which cannot exceed one mill. Warehouse management and maintenance fees must also be paid, with five mills per dan of rice, two and a half cents per dan of beans and wheat, and five cents per dan of cotton seeds per month. (6) Farmers who obtain benefits from the warehouse (calculated based on the market price on the date of entry into the warehouse and the price of the sale of the redeemable food, not limited to this), should deposit one-third of it into the syndicate for savings for famine, which cannot be withdrawn unless there is a disaster or special event.</p>
<p>(Jinshi First) The establishment of the warehouse will begin with Jinshi. All types of warehouses in the region are expected to be completed within three years, starting from 1934. A regional warehouse with a capacity of approximately 50,000 dan has now been established in Jinshi, a branch warehouse with a capacity of approximately 20,000 dan in Licheng, Xinzhou, Anxiang, and Xinan, and a branch warehouse with a capacity of approximately 5,000 dan in each village. In the summer of this year, the syndicate has already made production loans of 22,584 yuan in the Jinshi area. This is only a trial, and it will gradually expand to the countryside and other regions. Yuan Zhongda, Director of the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Field, Lu Zhiting, Manager of the Bank of China in Changsha, and Li Jingtao, Manager of the Shanghai Bank in Changsha, will be responsible for presiding over everything.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Severe Drought in Jing County, Anhui <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Fellow Villagers in Shanghai Are Telegraphically Requested for Relief</p>
<p>Since the fourth month of the lunar calendar, a severe drought has ravaged Jing County in southern Anhui Province. Rainfall has been scarce, and all the fields in the countryside are parched. Farmers are in despair over the crop failure, and some entire families have committed suicide, which is truly tragic. The public organizations in the county, recognizing the severity of the disaster, have sent telegrams to the Central Relief Committee and the Anhui Provincial authorities, requesting relief, and have also sent telegrams to fellow villagers in Shanghai, appealing for help. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To Mr. Zhu Rushan, Mr. Wei Shoujing, forwarded to Mr. Hu Pu, Mr. Zhu Dou, Mr. Zhu Jing, and all fellow villagers of Shanghai, Jingjian:</p>
<p>We have recently sent telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Jiang in Nanchang, Xu, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, Liu, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Miao, Special Commissioner of the Anhui Provincial Party Department, Mao, Director of the Anhui Department of Finance, Ma, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Anhui Relief Committee, Zhou, Administrative Inspector of Xuancheng, the Shanghai Sino-Foreign Relief Association, the Shanghai Jisheng Society, the Shanghai Red Cross Society, and the Shanghai Red Wanzihui, stating: Jing County is located in the mountains, and the fields are mostly barren. Even in good years, they are insufficient. However, since April 8th of this year's lunar calendar, a severe drought has ravaged the area. Rainfall has been scarce, and the fields are all parched. The crops have withered, and streams have dried up. Only a line of water remains in the large river, and drinking water is difficult in various places. Although we have sincerely prayed to Sanglin and made every effort to irrigate, hoping to remedy the situation, the wind god has been evil, and the sun crow has been unkind, and we have not been able to succeed. After investigation, the disaster area throughout the county has exceeded eight-tenths, and the number of disaster victims has reached more than 100,000, which is an unprecedented disaster and an unprecedented catastrophe. Moreover, since 1928, we have repeatedly suffered from banditry, coupled with years of famine. Our vitality has not recovered, and there is a lack of storage. In this strange famine, cries fill the fields, and the hungry fill the roads. Thousands of starving people are looking for food, and there is no way to provide relief. The most tragic thing is that the Hu family in Beixiang had seven family members who committed suicide by taking poison due to lack of food, and the entire family died. The Zhang Bao family in Nanxiang also hanged themselves due to unbearable hunger. Other similar deaths occur from time to time. In this dangerous situation, if we do not urgently request relief, not only will the lives of more than 100,000 disaster victims not be guaranteed, but also the security of the entire county will be difficult to maintain. We urge your council (seat) to show compassion and immediately provide emergency relief to save the disaster victims who are dying and to maintain the precarious situation. The telegram cannot express our urgency to await your orders.</p>
<p>We hope that you, gentlemen, will care about your hometown and be concerned about the hungry and drowning. Please unanimously act separately to appeal and solicit donations to save the disaster victims. We look forward to it and pray earnestly.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Problem of Rice Industry Collecting Dockage Fees <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The rice industry in Xuejiabang, Nanshi, built docks specifically for rice. Because rice ships from various ports arrive in Shanghai and the county docks are used for berthing and unloading, the rice firms paid for the construction of the docks. It was agreed that one cent per stone would be collected for rice shipped from inland to Shanghai as a dockage fee. The collection of the fee would be stopped once the amount paid by each firm was recovered. The collection of the fee began in 1929 and has lasted for six years. However, the rice firms in the interior reported that the amount of dockage fees paid had already reached the target amount, so they wrote to inquire. The Rice Merchants Association inquired, and if the amount was reached, they were asked to negotiate with the Bean and Rice Firm. However, the fee is still being collected this year. Therefore, in June, rice firms from various ports in the interior sent representatives to Shanghai specifically to hold a joint meeting to discuss countermeasures. They decided to ask the Rice Merchants Association to send a letter to the Bean and Rice Firm, requesting that a detailed account of the one cent dockage fee paid be announced before the end of June. If there was no satisfactory response, they would unanimously stop paying the fee starting in July. It has now been two months, and there has been no definite response. Therefore, in recent days, rice firms from various ports in the interior have sent representatives to Shanghai or written letters to the Rice Merchants Association to inquire and negotiate. Yesterday, the representatives who arrived in Shanghai held a special meeting with the rice ships that sell rice themselves to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Court to Improve Prison</p>
<p>Addition of Sanitary Equipment and Other Items</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Second Special District Court and the Third Branch of the High Court previously considered the existing detention center to be extremely small and planned to build a new prison, with the old prison to be used as a detention center. Wang Simao, President of the Second Special District Court, told the Central News Agency reporter that the construction of a new prison is not only lacking funds but also that there would be no source of ongoing expenses after the new prison was built. Therefore, this proposal has been shelved. The court is currently improving the old prison, such as establishing workshops, which have all been implemented. The average number of inmates in the prison is approximately 1,000, so there is no overcrowding. As for the detention center, it is considered to be simple and small. Sanitary equipment and other items are being added to improve it as much as possible in the unavoidable situation. On the other hand, the court is negotiating with the police to shorten the period for waiving appeals as much as possible to reduce the number of detainees and to provide the people with due protection.</p>

<p>Send Letters Requesting Suppression of Street Prostitutes</p>
<p>The 14th Branch of the United Association of Citizens in the First Special District and the Avenue Edward VII Business Association yesterday sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association, which forwarded it to the Public Works Department, requesting the suppression of street prostitutes ("wild chickens") who forcibly solicit customers. The letter states:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>According to shopkeepers and citizens in the Zhengjia Muqiao, Dongxinqiao, and Xizang Road areas of Avenue Edward VII, when the lights come on at night, pimps from brothels drive out prostitutes, who are covered in powder and stink. They are a ghastly sight. It is just like a prostitution market. They line up against each other, and the door is blocked. When passers-by pass by, they are forcibly solicited, regardless of their intentions. If they encounter single villagers or merchants, they will drag them en masse and even rob them of their belongings, which is like robbery. As a result, passers-by are afraid to pass by and regard it as a dangerous path, which hinders the business of shops and causes huge losses. Although these prostitutes have licenses, the Public Works Department stipulates that they are only allowed to receive customers at the entrance of the brothel and are not allowed to forcibly solicit customers arbitrarily. Although the Public Works Department occasionally sends people to arrest them, these prostitutes are vigilant and densely distributed. They avoid capture by calling out to each other, making it impossible for the police to exercise their authority. We should suppress them to protect customers.</p>
<p>After the association sent staff to investigate, the matter was submitted for discussion at the meeting. Everyone agreed that the rampant behavior of these prostitutes is extremely illegal, not only hindering business but also hindering the development of municipal administration. If they are not strictly suppressed, everyone will suffer. At a minimum, we should ask the Public Works Department to effectively suppress them in accordance with the regulations. Otherwise, we demand that the authorities stop issuing business licenses to prostitutes in the area and order them to move to quiet places to get rid of the filth.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, we are sending this letter to your association based on the case, requesting that you promptly forward it to the Public Works Department and find a way to effectively suppress them.</p>

<p>Promoting Domestic Production and Supporting Foreign Trade</p>
<p>The Ningbo Industrial Bank, located at No. 500 Henan Road in Shanghai, has been established since its inception. The bank is mainly engaged in industry, commerce, fisheries, various mortgage loans, and national goods circulation mortgage loans. With the development of its business, branches were added in Ningbo and Shenjiamen, specializing in financial assistance to the fishing industry, such as fisherman loans, fishery remittances, and other businesses, which have greatly promoted the development of the fishing industry and achieved remarkable results. The local fishermen have benefited from it. Loans are released during the fishing season and repaid on time, benefiting both the bank and the fishermen. The Shanghai head office specializes in factory goods mortgage loans and national goods circulation mortgage loans, free remittance services, and economic small loans, which promote the development of industry and the promotion of national goods. On the one hand, it connects with the same industry and provides financial assistance to foreign trade, so that the excellent products of various provinces in China can participate in the Chicago Exposition, which has been praised by people from various countries, and has a great effect on promoting culture and foreign trade. This year, a branch was added in Suzhou, and Mr. Wu Songlu, a senior banker, was hired to preside over everything. The business has also been developing well. Recently, two warehouses have been established in Kunshan to first handle mortgage loans for farmers. After achieving results, other businesses will be expanded. The bank will also cooperate with the same industry and gentry and merchants in the area. It is reported that the bank's original building is not enough for office use, so it has selected the Water Gate Steel Bone Building at No. 261 Nanjing Road, the intersection of Shanxi Road, as its new address. The interior is currently being renovated, and it will be moved on the 19th of next month.</p>

<p>A Robbery at a Cigarette and Paper Shop - One Thief Captured</p>
<p>At approximately 7 PM yesterday, a cigarette and paper shop named Yi Da He, located at number 157 Fumin Road within the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct, Second Substation of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, was suddenly invaded by two robbers dressed in black shirts and trousers. Under the pretense of being customers, one of the robbers brandished a handgun, warning them not to make a sound. They then robbed the shop of approximately over a hundred yuan in cash and silver coins, as well as a gold ring worn by the shop owner’s wife. After acquiring their loot, they fled in separate directions. Zhang Xin’gen (18 years old), a local apprentice at the shop, was quite quick-witted. Seeing the robbers leave, he secretly followed behind, giving chase. However, when one of the robbers reached Penglai Road, he realized he was being followed. He then fired two shots as a warning, while Zhang Xin’gen simultaneously shouted for help to catch the thief. Immediately, police whistles sounded. The robber then fled into Liu Xing Lane within the First Precinct, reaching Caojia Bridge. At this time, police officer Song Yuting from Post 30 had already pursued him closely. As a result, he was finally intercepted by police officer Zhang Zukun from Post 31. At the time, Shen Zhenhua, the chief of the First Precinct, was leading many senior officers on patrol nearby. Hearing the commotion, they immediately rushed to the scene, taking both the robber and the apprentice Zhang Xin’gen to the station. At the same time, the police also found a six-inch Browning pistol (number 3083) discarded by the robber inside a short wall in Liu Xing Lane, containing four bullets. Initially, Zhang Xin’gen provided a clear account of the robbery situation. Upon interrogation, the robber confessed that his name was Zhang Changsheng, 35 years old, from Hefei, Anhui. He readily admitted to being involved with a gang. After the interrogation, Chief Liu immediately telegraphed the Inspectorate and promptly prepared a document to be submitted to the Judicial Section for questioning.</p>

<p>Prohibiting the Killing of Animals</p>
<p>Requesting Orders from the Two Concession Municipal Councils</p>
<p>Following the Precedent of the Former Mixed Court</p>
<p>The Chinese Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals believes that Western countries have long established special laws and incorporated them into their legal systems to protect animals, and these laws have been quite effective since their implementation. In recent times, leaders from Britain, America, Italy, Germany, France, and Japan have been the most vigorous advocates, and their efforts have been widely reported and admired worldwide. As for our Chinese gentry, due to their early civilization, they all possess a benevolent and compassionate heart. Therefore, they have also established societies to promote animal protection movements, hoping to achieve the ideal of treating animals as fellow beings. However, in Shanghai, where Chinese and foreigners live together, people are of varying qualities, and conscience is easily lost. There are often gluttonous individuals who indulge their appetites and treat the abuse or killing of animals as commonplace. For example, pigeons are suffocated with ropes around their mouths, mountain chickens have their tongues cut and bleed to death, various snails are subjected to the death of having their tails cut off alive, chickens and ducks are tied up and hung upside down before slaughter, live frogs are skinned and sold, and so on. These sights are common in vegetable markets and thoroughfares. The former Mixed Court had strictly prohibited such behavior, and offenders were punished with fines or imprisonment, as a slight deterrent. This was because innocent animals were unfortunate enough to be cooked and eaten, but it was even worse to subject them to inhumane treatment at the time of their death, causing them to struggle and suffer. Anyone with a human heart would abhor this. The intention was to persuade through prohibition, and the law was both beautiful and good. However, since the reorganization of the Mixed Court into the Special District Court, this strict prohibition has been relaxed, causing unscrupulous residents to become complacent over time and gradually return to their old ways. Therefore, the Society specifically sent a letter to the Municipal Councils of the two concessions yesterday, ordering all police stations to continue to follow the strict prohibition measures of the former Mixed Court, and to supervise Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct thorough investigations and issue notices prohibiting the abuse and killing of animals, to answer to Heaven and maintain the laws of the people. If there are any who outwardly comply but inwardly defy, stubbornly clinging to their evil ways, they should be severely punished to preserve animal life and curb the cruel customs, so that the killing can be stopped and world peace can be achieved.</p>

<p>Zhou Shengfa Released to the District Court</p>
<p>Prosecutor Waited for Trial That Night</p>
<p>Zhou Shengfa, the Red Pill King from Yuyao, raised a large amount of capital this spring and privately set up a large-scale organization at No. 1382 Longhua Road in Nanshi to manufacture Feima brand red pills, which were exclusively sold in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other ports. Branch offices were established in each of these locations for secret sales, with astonishing quantities. Although the time was short, the profits were already substantial. On February 4th, the Municipal Public Security Bureau seized 2.4 million red pills worth over 200,000 yuan at the North Railway Station, and arrested key criminals Zhao Zuting and Wang Weicheng (also known as Xiao Wang), as well as three police officers who were found to be sheltering and transporting the goods. They were handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for investigation and were all executed by firing squad. However, Wang Weicheng's confession revealed that the mastermind Zhou Shengfa had escaped. Despite extensive searches, he had not been apprehended until recently, when Detective Ling Tianpeng of the Public Security Bureau received a tip from an informant that Zhou was hiding at No. 20, Lane 707, Yuanyuan Lane, Gordon Road in the Public Concession. Together with Chinese and foreign detectives, they went to the address and arrested Zhou, handing him over to the First Special District Court. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi opened a court session for preliminary interrogation. The Public Security Bureau ordered Detective Ling Tianpeng to present a document requesting the transfer of Zhou Shengfa for questioning, but Zhou stubbornly refused to confess. As a result, the judge ruled that the suspect Zhou Shengfa be transferred to the District Court Procuratorate for investigation. At 5:30 PM, the First Special District Court first notified the Nanshi District Court Procuratorate by telephone, stating that the 26th of the following day (i.e., yesterday) was a Sunday, and the 27th was also Confucius's birthday, so offices would be closed. Therefore, they were allowed to transfer the suspect Zhou that night. Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying of the District Court then instructed the prosecutor on duty, Lei Binzhang, to postpone leaving and wait until 8:35 PM, when the First Special District Court ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to escort the suspect Zhou Shengfa to the District Court, where Prosecutor Lei opened a court session for investigation and ordered him to be properly detained. By the time Zhou was taken into custody at the detention center, it was already 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Lao Zha Police Station received a telephone report from Bao Long Hospital stating that a Wu Afu had been severely injured by an axe and requesting that officers be dispatched for investigation. The police chief ordered Detective Feng Xiushan to investigate. According to Wu, he was attacked on Beihai Road. The detectives rushed to Beihai Road to investigate. Near the intersection of Beihai Road and Guangxi Road, they saw two men sitting on a small coffin, acting suspiciously. They went forward to inquire, but the two men immediately fled in panic. After chasing and catching them, they learned that their names were Wang Agou from Suzhou and Chen Amao from Changzhou. They were taken to the police station along with the small coffin. Upon opening the coffin, there was no child's body inside, only two axes and sixteen iron rods. When asked what they were for, they refused to tell the truth. Yesterday, they were handed over to the First Special District Court Criminal Division 1. Attorney Gan Jingxian of the police station requested permission to detain them for investigation, as the case still required further investigation. Judge Qian approved the request and ordered Wang Agou and Chen Amao to be detained.</p>

<p>Trial Concluded, Sentence Scheduled</p>
<p>Pu Wenting, the manager of Fuxin Flour Mill from Wuxi, and Qian Zhaofu, the owner of a local timber firm in Nanshi, were kidnapped in the French Concession four years ago and held for a large ransom. After the case broke, the French police apprehended the kidnappers, Zheng Shifan and Zhang Afu, both locals, and handed them over to the Second Special District Court. In the first instance, Zheng was sentenced to life imprisonment and Zhang to 20 years. Zheng and the others were dissatisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. As a result, Zheng's sentence was reduced to 12 years of imprisonment, and Zhang's sentence was changed to life imprisonment. Because the two convicts were still unwilling to accept the verdict, they filed a third appeal with the Supreme Court. After reviewing the entire case file, the Supreme Court found that there was still a question about Zheng Shifan borrowing a telephone at a certain exchange to contact the victims. Therefore, it ruled to overturn the original verdict and send the case back to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial, as reported in previous news. The Third Branch of the High Court has ordered the police station to conduct a new investigation and summon witnesses to the case. After completing the interrogation, presiding Judge Guo Dexin, along with associate judges Sun and Fan, and Prosecutor Zhang, opened a joint court session for trial on the morning of the day before yesterday. Attorney Yao Zhaodi represented the Police Department and made detailed statements against the appellants' points of appeal. Attorneys Ma Shouhua and others defended the appellants. The court then announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 31st. The appellants were returned to the detention center to await the verdict.</p>

<p>Election of Historical Greats</p>
<p>Commemorating the Sales Success of Guanghua Brand Cigarettes</p>
<p>Last year, the China Huamei Tobacco Company's "Buy a Stick" scholarship program received high praise from society. Now, with the sales success of its Guanghua brand of Chinese standard cigarettes, the company's general manager Jing Yimeng, co-managers Wang Yongchang, Yu Zhong'e, and others have decided to save on advertising and promotional expenses to offer the Chinese Historical Greats Election Scholarship again. This move, in addition to benefiting young people, allows everyone to examine the ancient people and understand what made them able to glorify China, promote their spirit, strengthen their will, and be pioneers for the country and serve society. The meaning is great and worth introducing. The methods have been drafted and will be announced soon. Here is their declaration:</p>
<p>The long history of our nation, the richness and brilliance of our cultural achievements, the fact that we are an ancient country in East Asia, and more advanced than Europe and America, are all derived from the crystallization of the thoughts and deeds of great men of all generations. The reason why great men could be produced in all generations cannot but be attributed to education. However, in today's society, with the decline of the social economy and the high cost of living, even a family of eight can hardly make ends meet, let alone afford education. Young people lose the opportunity to study, and they regret it when they get old. This is a hidden worry of society and a regret for young people. Our company has always held the great ambition that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world, believing that the key to a wealthy country and a strong people is not at the top but at the bottom, not to be blamed on the government but to be the responsibility of the people. It is not difficult to enrich the country, revitalizing domestic goods is enough. It is not difficult to strengthen the people, promoting education is enough. The government and the people are responsible for revitalizing domestic goods and promoting education. Over the years, we have been thinking about this day and night. Therefore, to the best of our ability, at the time of the prosperous sales of our company's Guanghua brand Chinese standard cigarettes, we will save advertising and promotional expenses and transfer them to scholarships for the election of historically great men. Selling domestic goods in order to enrich the country, promoting education in order to strengthen the people. We hope that all parents who love to smoke domestic Guanghua brand cigarettes will collect the small blue Guanghua stamped stickers or the empty Guanghua brand ten-pack boxes and give them to their children to use for the election of historically great men. In the study, after dinner, parents enjoy the clean and happy experience of domestic cigarettes, and children enjoy the right to vote and receive educational scholarships. Enriching the country and strengthening the people can be achieved in one fell swoop. Our company has already conducted a trial run of awarding scholarships once before, and it has been well-received by society. However, we still feel that it is not enough, so we will continue to make persistent efforts to continue to hold the event. Our sincere intention is to not only benefit young people but also enable everyone to think deeply, examine how the ancients were able to achieve a renaissance through one success and one trip, how they were able to endure hardship and defeat their enemies, and how they were able to plant trees for ten years and cultivate people for a hundred years, to cultivate outstanding talents who can directly attack the Yellow Dragon and recover lost land. All of these are historical materials that today's young students must study. The ancients have passed away, but the righteous spirit of heaven and earth and the brilliance of history will always be a model for future generations. We hope that we can contribute to the enrichment of the country and the strengthening of the people while promoting domestic goods.</p>

<p>Since Russia implemented the New Economic Policy, various construction projects within the country have progressed rapidly, and industrial and commercial enterprises have made special progress, resulting in a surplus trend in various commodities. Cosmetics for women's decoration, because the authorities advocate thrift and do not allow women to wear makeup, the surplus has increased even more. Therefore, they are actively promoting sales to China. According to the Russian Merchants Association, the amount shipped to China last week was valued at over one million yuan, reaching over a thousand boxes, mostly perfumes and hair tonics. The appearance is not as elegant as European and American products, and the prices are also lower, but the sales volume is quite impressive.</p>

<p>Requests Exemption from Re-Levying of Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax</p>
<p>Small Businesses Unable to Bear the Burden</p>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for Further Request</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol industries in this city, regarding the issue of re-levying licenses, due to uneven treatment in tax assessment and investigation, the Shanghai South Office of the Cigarette and Exchange Industry Association yesterday received a joint letter signed by over a hundred businesses, including Baoxin at No. 51 Houjia Road in the city, Chengchang at No. 14 Wei Wu Branch Road, No. 355 Jumen Road, etc., stating, "We received a notice from your association to register with the Finance Bureau as scheduled and apply for tax payment and licensing. However, after a few days, the investigators from the Tax Assessment Office said that each license would require an additional two yuan. We went to the office, but it was a weekday and they were closed. We went to collect them the next day, but they wanted to add 2.4 yuan. We are small husband-and-wife shops, making a living with meager capital, and unable to bear the burden. When the Ministry of Finance collected taxes, it was still able to sympathize, collecting only two yuan per quarter. The central government, in view of the bankruptcy of rural areas and the depression of all industries, abolished harsh and miscellaneous taxes, with the aim of reducing the burden on citizens. Merchants were overjoyed and grateful. However, the cigarettes we sell have already paid the consolidated tax and regular tax, and the license should be tax-exempt. Now, the Finance Bureau not only does not exempt us, but also increases the tax. Our small businesses cannot bear the heavy burden. We have no choice but to jointly write to your association and send the attached receipts, requesting that you forward them to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, imploring the Finance Bureau to consider the difficulties of the merchants and approve the issuance of new licenses to show sympathy and maintain our businesses." It is reported that the association has already compiled a list based on this and submitted it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as the second batch of requests.</p>

<p>Handle According to Regulations, Divide into Grades</p>
<p>In Order to Reduce the Suffering of Small Businesses</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the uneven distribution of tobacco and alcohol taxes has aroused opposition from the industry. They have requested the industry association to forward their request to the Municipal Finance Bureau for correction. As of yesterday, the issue had not yet been resolved. Yesterday, we inquired at the South District Office of the Industry Association. According to the person in charge, "Our association is a group of industry members, seeking to facilitate the business of the entire industry. We have repeatedly received reports from members that the grades of tax levies are uneven, which is not conducive to stable business operations. We request that the Municipal Government authorities correct this and reduce the suffering of small businesses. According to our investigation, in the 16th year of the Republic, taxes were levied twice a year, at two yuan per term. In the 17th year, it was changed to four seasons per year, but still two yuan per quarter, which effectively added four yuan per year. In recent years, tax levies have often not been handled according to regulations. Large stores pay less, while family industries or small shops pay more, creating a distorted situation. Therefore, reports have been submitted to our association. We have previously petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request fair measures to ensure balance so that the members of our industry can gradually become stable."</p>

<p>Previously Caused Trouble at Hall and Holtz</p>
<p>Injured a Female Shop Assistant with an Umbrella</p>
<p>Also Claimed to be the Egyptian Goddess</p>
<p>Regarding the incident reported yesterday of a madwoman harassing the American Consul General's Office, according to the North China Daily News, the madwoman's name is Pike, 19 years old, residing at No. 62 Donghuai De Road. Before harassing the American Consul General's Office, she went to Hall and Holtz on Nanjing Road and struck female shop assistants Huimeier and Velilla with an umbrella. When the two women fled to another room, Ms. Pike also went into the road and disappeared. The two female shop assistants then went to the Central Police Station to report the incident, stating that they recognized the assailant as Ms. Pike. Ms. Huimeier suffered minor injuries to her hand, and Ms. Velilla suffered minor abrasions to her lips. When asked about the reason for the attack, they replied that it was probably because one of them shared a young boyfriend with Ms. Pike, and it was caused by jealousy. While the two women were still at the police station, the fire brigade's ambulance arrived with Ms. Pike. It was then learned that Ms. Pike had gone to the American Consul General's Office to make a scene after leaving Hall and Holtz. Ms. Pike claimed to be an American citizen, but the American authorities did not recognize her. Later, her mother was summoned and ordered to take her back and restrain her, and she was given a warning. According to the police investigation, the woman's father was an American naval officer, and her mother was Japanese. The daughter was born after the father went to the United States. Therefore, neither the American nor the Japanese consulate recognized the woman or her mother. When the woman harassed the American Consul General's Office, she claimed to be the Egyptian goddess and a close friend of the British Prince.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Water Outage in Huakangli <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Rent Arrears Should Be Handled According to Law</p>
<p>Water Supply Should Not Be Cut Off</p>
<p>In Huakangli, Huakang Road, Zhabei, the landlord cut off the water supply the day before yesterday (Sunday, the 5th) due to some reason. More than ten sub-tenants, including Ji Ruyou, jointly submitted a petition to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, requesting relief. This matter was reported in the newspapers. It is now known that after the Fourth District Chief Gong reviewed the report, he repeatedly ordered the landlord, Tan Fuji, to appear, but he never did. Yesterday afternoon, Tan Li, the sister-in-law of Tan Fuji, was summoned. According to her, the tenants in the alley were using too much water, so she had previously agreed with the tenants to switch to well water. However, the cost of digging the well was to be shared by the tenants, but now the tenants are unwilling to pay and owe a lot of rent, so the water was cut off. Ji Ruyou and others stated, "We do not owe rent, and Tan Fuji not only cut off the water supply but also ordered us to move out. We request relief." After questioning, the officials believed that if the tenants owed too much rent, they could apply to the court for mediation. If mediation failed, they could formally file a lawsuit. As for the water supply, it should not be cut off and should be opened immediately to resolve the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e165">On Practice and Pragmatism <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Reply to Mr. Tan Mengruo —</p>
<p>After reading our "Explanation of Practice," Mr. Tan wrote to ask: What is pragmatism? Pragmatism and practice are easily confused, hence Mr. Tan's confusion.</p>
<p>Pragmatism, as the name suggests, places great importance on practical effect. Anything useful is a good thing. Any useful speech is the truth. If we take it a step further, it becomes utilitarianism, where everything is measured by benefit and effectiveness, regardless of anything else. We cannot say that this doctrine is completely unreasonable. Since people must live, they cannot ignore the benefits of life. If my life compels me to use an abacus every day, and I refuse to do so, wouldn't I starve to death? If I starve to death, how can I care about anything else?</p>
<p>However, we must pay attention to the fact that pragmatism places too much importance, too much emphasis on the effects of application, measuring everything by practicality, and obliterating all theories and truths. There are many people in the world who specialize in practicality. They say that doing things must be down-to-earth, and they consider all theories to be empty talk. "Empty talk is of no use in practice." This is true, but to negate even all reasonable and scientific theories because of opposition to empty talk is a big mistake. Because, if we are aiming to be sloppy, muddling through, then of course we don’t need any theory. If we want to broaden our horizons, to make our lives more advanced, to make our actions go in a more correct direction, then we cannot do without the guidance of theory.</p>
<p>Taking reading as an example, if we look at it entirely from a practical point of view, then novels of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School can provide us with entertainment, and of course they have practical value. Jokes can make us smile after hard work, which is also very practical. These things can have a temporary paralyzing effect on our spirits, making us forget the pain of life, isn’t that also good? However, the practical effect of these things is only to be able to deceive our eyes, making us unable to see the painful reality around us, making our lives without purpose, making us decadent. If we want to understand the society around us, to determine a correct direction for our efforts, these things are still of no use to us. In this case, we won't get any results except by studying scientific theories.</p>
<p>Therefore, pragmatism, which completely denies theory, has a "practical" effect that is limited to dealing with the present and cannot produce further effects. As long as we broaden our horizons a little, we will know that this narrow practical concept is still useless in the end!</p>
<p>If we are not just muddling through life, resigned to fate, if we are to struggle and move forward, then we must first clearly understand our surroundings, and then we can find the right path. Without the help of theory, it is impossible to understand this complex society clearly. Theory can help us understand, and that is the use of theory. Therefore, the theory despised by pragmatists is actually more practical than pragmatism itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, narrow pragmatism is undesirable. But now we must pay attention to another point, that is, although we oppose narrow pragmatism, we cannot regard theory as omnipotent. We must also remember the saying "Empty talk of theory is of no use in practice." Theory in books alone is of no use. The theory in books is only enough for reference, as an aid to our lives and actions. We must also take the things in books to practical life for verification. Sometimes, we can find richer things in life than in books. And we must also remember that all the theories in books originally come from the practical lives and practical research of many people. Practical life is the real source of living theory.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we must use theory to guide life, and on the other hand, we must use life to correct theory, and discover new theories in life. This is practice. Practice is the unity of "pragmatism" and "theory." Pragmatism is not practice, and empty theory is not practice.</p>

<h3 id="e168">On Being Humane <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>There are all kinds of people in the world: white people, black people, and yellow people. In ancient times, the yellow race was self-respecting, believing that apart from themselves, all other races were beasts. The translators of the "Office in Charge of Affairs of All Nations" did not regard the other races as human beings. The honorifics "Feilanxi" and "Yingjieli" are clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>Now we know that there are other people in the world besides ourselves, but within the same society, there are also distinctions between rich people, poor people, important people, and great people. Even among human beings, there are distinctions between men and women.</p>
<p>This is like talking to a child, and there should be no suspicion of being too difficult or obscure. But there is a common abusive word that people use, which is "inhumane." What kind of humanity should this refer to?</p>
<p>Bathing frequently and changing into clean clothes should be humane, but if the person is poor, then it is eccentric and extravagant; if the person is rich, then it is humane. In the United States, working eight hours a day is normal. In China (if it is a young master or old master), stipulating a certain number of working hours per day is inhumane. In general, this phrase encompasses all things that are Europeanized, modernized, and do not conform to ordinary people. And this vague standard is determined by the speaker's delusions.</p>
<p>Ji Shuye once liked blacksmithing, which seemed inhumane, but the inhumane aspect of the members of the imperial family was their elegance. If they committed evil deeds, ordinary people would not dare to oppose them. If it were a commoner, he might have been beaten long ago. In the Six Dynasties, some people even liked to give people the cold shoulder, which can be considered extremely eccentric, but no one dared to oppose him. It can be seen that even if public opinion recognizes someone as a bad egg, or as being inhumane, there are still concerns or reticence due to their status and class.</p>
<p>Conversely, all cunning and treacherous people are sure to be extremely humane. It is said that treacherous officials throughout history were mostly kind and amiable. Wang Mang was actually humble and respectful to scholars. Only fools who want to reform society are willing to bear the slanders of the times and endure hardships. People like Wang Jinggong have long been subjected to this four-character curse.</p>
<p>Those who are determined to do things should really ignore the murky criticisms. Those who cater to human emotions too much, unless they have ulterior motives, are simply fools, for sure.</p>

<p>— Feier</p>
<p>Every evening, piles of dry firewood and dead leaves would gather at the corner of the "Attap" house, and a fire would be lit, filling the house with smoke that made it hard to breathe. While the mosquitoes were being smoked away, the stench of urine at the corner of the house would also be reduced, and the house owner would be trained to be an animal accustomed to being smoked by fire.</p>
<p>When there were major events such as weddings and funerals in the village, the sheepskin drum would be put to even greater use. At that time, there would be long processions passing through the streets, with priests chanting scriptures, and women wearing brightly colored headscarves to cover their faces. In the evening, the families holding weddings and funerals would offer chickens and sheep with thin wine to entertain guests, and relatives and friends would serve the hosts. The priests would chant scriptures until midnight.</p>
<p>Around the time of the "Fasting Festival," the village would be bustling with the slaughter of cattle and sheep. The villagers would also be busy knocking down coconuts and betel nuts to exchange them for festival items at the market. As a result, the fires in the villages would be extinguished during the day, and huge flames would be lit in front of each "Attap" house at night. Joy flooded the entire countryside, and the peaceful village atmosphere would be broken.</p>
<p>When the waves of "recession" deeply invaded the countryside from the city, the tranquility of the countryside began to fluctuate. Taxes could not be forced out, and soldiers marched into the countryside with guns. While the higher-class Malays remained leisurely, the lower-class commoners were subjected to trampling. The peaceful Malay villages since the time of their ancestors were now threatened, and the color of the world was changing in history!</p>
<p>Today's Malay villages are stirring up ripples, like stones thrown into a calm lake. When the old people and priests can no longer quietly kneel towards the West in the evening, paying homage to their Holy Lord Muhammad's sacred land, I fear that the scenery of the Malay villages will undergo drastic changes again!</p>
<h3 id="e170">Female Leader <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>Under the torches burning with pine resin, a person suddenly fell down, and a scream of pain, mixed with bright red hot blood, burst out together.</p>
<p>"Good technique!"</p>
<p>The people standing in the house watching cried out like wolves, praising.</p>
<p>Another person put away the blood-stained knife, looked arrogantly at the dead person, and then walked to the female leader, whispering:</p>
<p>"Now I have won!"</p>
<p>He raised his head wrapped in black cloth, and raised his proud eyes, as if to say: Please fulfill your promise.</p>
<p>The female leader opened her beautiful big eyes, resolutely drew the two fingers extended in front of her chest outwards, and said quietly:</p>
<p>"I still can't love you."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>The victorious man shouted, his face immediately changing to a look of pain. At the same time, the blood-dripping knife suddenly fell to the ground covered with chicken bones and deer bones.</p>
<p>"Because you are injured," the female leader took the remaining half bowl of wine on the table and drank it in one gulp, continuing, with intense enthusiasm, "I want – I want – Heaven, I want to love the bravest man, he will never be injured!"</p>
<p>The dejected man immediately saw his bleeding left wrist, which had been secretly cut by the opponent at the moment the other party fell down. He had endured it and only now felt the pain, and said miserably:</p>
<p>"But I was injured for you."</p>
<p>"But you didn't do it to protect me!"</p>
<p>The female leader turned around, faced the window hung with ivy, and took a deep breath towards the valley shrouded in the dark night. The pine forests spreading over the mountains rose with a great sound of waves, coming closer from afar, roaring.</p>
<p>The man in pain, his face pale, begged in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Then, please just use your hand to wrap the wound with cloth!"</p>
<p>The female leader did not speak, but only used two fingers to tidy the hair that had been ruffled by the mountain wind, her eyes still looking at the dark night sleeping outside the window.</p>
<p>"You won't even give me this little bit of pity?"</p>
<p>The female leader still stood with her back to him, coldly saying:</p>
<p>"A person without pity is not worthy of receiving pity."</p>
<p>"Don't I have pity?"</p>
<p>"You have pity?" The female leader suddenly turned around, pointed at the corpse soaked in blood, and said as if cutting through iron, "How did he die? Isn't he still your brother?"</p>
<p>"I am a fool, a fool!"</p>
<p>The begging man wiped his neck with the knife, and fell down dejectedly, bursting out a sorrowful cry.</p>
<p>The female leader raised her sword-like eyebrows, flashing a terrifying light in her eyes, but at the same time, she said charmingly to the crowd:</p>
<p>"No one can possess me alone! I want to be the lover of all of you, because all of you together are the bravest in the world!"</p>
<p>The brothers, stunned by this incident, then hurriedly agreed:</p>
<p>"The leader's words are right!"</p>
<p>At the same time, such a meaning floated in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>"You are really drunk!"</p>
<p>However, in any case, everyone was very happy. Immediately, they followed her onto their horses and went out.</p>
<p>In the dark mountains, the songs of the bandits immediately rose up, but they were soon swallowed by the sound of the pine waves. Thus, the mountain inn covered with bark roofs seemed to have been abandoned, crouching lonely at the bottom of the cliff.</p>

<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>(3) How did characters come about?</p>
<p>According to the "Book of Changes," it is clear that knotting ropes came before writing. When our countrymen in the countryside have an important thing to do tomorrow and are afraid of forgetting, they often say, "Tie a knot on your waistband!" So, did our ancient sages also use a long rope, tying a knot for every event? I'm afraid that wouldn't work. They might remember a few knots, but too many would be a mess. Or perhaps that was just like the "Eight Trigrams" of Emperor Fuxi, three ropes in a group. "Qian" is where none of them are knotted, and "Kun" is where each of them has a knot in the middle? I'm afraid that's not right either. Eight groups would be okay, but sixty-four groups would be difficult to remember, let alone five hundred and twelve groups. Only the "knotting words" (Quippug) that remain in Peru, using a horizontal rope with many vertical ropes hanging from it, tied up and down, looking less like a net, but seemingly able to express more meanings. I'm afraid our ancient knotting ropes were like this. But since it has been replaced by writing, and it is not the ancestor of writing, we may as well leave it alone for the time being.</p>
<p>The "Kou Lou Stele" of Xia Yu was forged by Taoists. The oldest writing we can now see in real objects is only the inscriptions on bones and bronze ware from the Shang Dynasty. But these are already very advanced, and it is almost impossible to find an original form. Only on bronzes can we sometimes see a bit of realistic drawings, such as deer and elephants, and from these drawings, we can find clues related to writing: The foundation of Chinese characters is "pictographic."</p>
<p>The wild bull painted in the Altamira cave in Spain is a famous relic of primitive people. Many art historians say that this is precisely "art for art's sake," something that primitive people painted for fun. But this explanation is a bit too "modern," because primitive people did not have as much leisure as the artists of the nineteenth century. His painting of a bull had a reason, which was related to the bull, or to hunting bulls, or to cursing bulls. Even now, people often stare with their mouths open at the cigarette and movie advertisements on the walls of Shanghai. In a primitive society where strange things were rare, one can imagine the sensation that such a miracle would have caused. As they watched, they learned that the thing that was a wild bull could be transferred to another surface using lines, and at the same time they seemed to recognize the character "bull". They also admired the author's talent, but no one asked him to write an autobiography to make money, so the surname was lost. But in society, there was more than one Cangjie. Some carved a picture on a knife handle, some painted some pictures on the doors. Hearts resonated with each other, and words were passed down orally, so that there were more and more words. Once the historians collected them, they could perfunctorily record events. I am afraid that the origin of Chinese characters cannot escape this example.</p>
<p>Naturally, there should be continuous additions later. This is something that historians themselves can do. New characters are inserted among familiar characters, and they are also pictographic, so others can easily guess the meaning of the character. Even now, Chinese is still creating new characters. However, trying to be a new Cangjie will fail. Zhu Yu of Wu and Wu Zetian of Tang all created strange characters, and all their efforts were in vain. Now, the most adept at creating characters are Chinese chemists. The names of many elements and compounds are not easy to recognize, and even the sounds are difficult to pronounce. To be honest, I get a headache as soon as I see them, and I feel that it is far better to use the universally used Latin names. If you don't recognize twenty or so letters, please forgive me for saying it straight: then, you probably won't learn chemistry well either.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Younger Brother <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>Oh, younger brother, he has been gone from this wicked world for more than a year! Was his death ultimately his happiness or his misfortune? That's "hard to say"; but for me—as long as I have some leisure in my busy schedule, or when I lie in bed with my eyes open late at night, that innocent face of his comes into my mind, as if I heard a "brother" in my ear, and in an instant, that bloody and blurred corpse seems to be placed before my eyes. Oh, I am in pain, I am indignant, I grab my disheveled hair, I clench my thin fists—oh, he is dead!</p>
<p>When my younger brother was a child, he was very naughty. He never seemed to feel that he should study. When Dad died, he was only three years old, and he certainly didn't know that the family was in difficulty. After that, every time the New Year was over, he would hear Mom planning everything for me, and he would just open his innocent big eyes, as if listening to irrelevant stories from overseas—in fact, he was already almost ten years old at that time, and it was time for him to study.</p>
<p>Mom was very capable: although she spat blood, she still had to bite the bullet and resist the bullying from those uncles; he inherited a small shop left by Dad, and stood upright in front of a group of relatives and friends to prop up the scene;...all of this was for us! Her philosophy was: Please, sons, bring her honor in the future! She lived like this. Every year, at the beginning of the year, she would have to go to various places to arrange tuition fees for us; no, it should be said that it was for me alone. Borrowing money was so difficult! Every time she walked out of someone's counter under contemptuous eyes, she could only think: Let's get the older one "on the right track" first. However, my younger brother was left aside.</p>
<p>My younger brother had a rugged body. His face and hands were sunburned red. Short, but imposing, he always opened his big black eyes when he saw someone. I rarely saw him when I came home from school every afternoon. It wasn't until the evening, when Mom lit a small bean-sized vegetable oil lamp for me and supervised me as I studied at night, that he jumped back with a black eye and a swollen face. Sometimes, there were even scratches on his face. Of course, Mom would twist his ears and drag him to the bench to spank him. Before the board even touched his flesh, he would start yelling "Ouch, ouch"; when he was done, a feeling of resentment and indifference would flash across his black and red face. In this way, Mom finally covered her eyes with her sleeves and cried.</p>

<p>China and the United States Both Win Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Lin Qiu Defeats De Fu and Peng Nifeiqu</p>
<p>The results of the second day of the Rotary Cup Shanghai International Tennis Semi-Finals, China and the United States have both won, the United States has defeated Japan with a score of three to zero, and won the right to the finals. The remaining two singles matches will be held at the original venue this afternoon, but the victory or defeat is irrelevant to the championship. China defeated the United Kingdom with a score of five to zero. Yesterday's doubles match was full of excitement, unprecedented in Shanghai. The result was that China's Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai won 4-6, 8-6, 6-2, 9-7.</p>
<h3 id="e175">～～Yesterday's Results from Four Matches～～ <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>(America Wins Over Japan) Yesterday's match, due to the participation of four major figures in Chinese and English doubles, attracted a considerable audience of about five to six hundred people. The Japanese-American doubles match started first. In the first two sets, the Japanese players did not show any particular strengths, and the American team won very easily. However, from the third set onwards, Tsukiji and Kamata of Japan suddenly found their stride, with impressive smashes and volleys. Consequently, they managed to win one set back, and in the fourth set, they even had a very good lead with a score of 5 to 3. Unfortunately, they were still caught up by their opponents and lost with a score of one to three sets.</p>
<p>{6 to 3}</p>
<p>Carlsen (US) 6 to 2 Tsukiji (Japan)</p>
<p>Squire 4 to 6 Kamata</p>
<p>8 to 6</p>
<p>(China Wins Over England) The Chinese-English doubles match followed the Japanese-American match. The intense battle lasted for four sets, and the atmosphere was tense with continuous cheers. In the singles match between Zheng Zhaojia and Forbes, the continuous rallies took a long time. Zheng Zhaojia made too many mistakes, and Forbes was particularly favored. Although he was often outmaneuvered by Zheng's cross-court shots, he ran tirelessly and handled the situation with ease. Zheng lost the third set with a score of three to six. In the fourth set, Zheng was again trailing with a score of one to four and was in a precarious situation. He then proceeded cautiously and turned defeat into victory with a score of six to four, which seemed very strenuous. Wang Wenzheng seemed careless before his match against Stokes. Stokes had no desire to fight, and only won one game in three sets, which took very little time. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>{4 to 6} De Vere (England)</p>
<p>Lin Baohua (China) 8 to 6</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai 6 to 2 Bonnicuf</p>
<p>9 to 7</p>
<p>{6 to 2}</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (China) 6 to 1 Forbes (England)</p>
<p>3 to 6</p>
<p>6 to 4</p>
<p>{6 to 0} Stokes (England)</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (China) 6 to 1</p>
<p>6 to 0</p>
<h3 id="e176">～～Record of the Chinese-English Doubles Match～～ <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>(Numerous Highlights) The four players each displayed their unique characteristics. The tense situation was rarely seen before. Qiu Feihai was as consistent as ever, and Lin Baohua was particularly diligent, using either hard serves or twisting, curved serves to great effect. Beautiful shots often left opponents helpless. However, as the two players were cooperating for the first time this year, their coordination was not yet perfect. De Vere's powerful smashes at the net were the best among the four players. Bonnicuf's two-handed racket grip in front of the net, gently flicking the ball to the side, earned much applause. Viewers hailed it as a "secret weapon," which was very apt.</p>
<p>(Struggling to Cope) After the start of the game, with bold and vigorous strokes, the sound of rackets colliding resounded, showing sufficient strength. England took the lead with three to one. De Vere's serve resulted in two double faults, and then two more volleys went into the net. China chased back one game. Lin's serve was actually broken, making the situation even more precarious. The opponents were tall and used high-pressure tactics frequently, making it difficult for Lin and Qiu to cope. They were trailing with a score of two to five. After Qiu won his serve, De Vere hit three shots out of bounds, and China managed to add two games in a row, making it four to five, with a momentum to catch up. In the next game, with Lin Baohua serving, they also took the lead with three to one. They only needed to win one more point to make it five to five. Who knew that things would not go as planned? Qiu lost three consecutive points, and Lin's smash went out of bounds, losing with a score of four to six.</p>
<p>(Winning After Fierce Battle) In the second set, there was an even more intense struggle. Bonnicuf served first and lost the game. Qiu Feihai also lost his serve. De Vere gained a lead of two to one with three powerful serves. China tied it to two to two with four to one. Later, it became three to three, three to four, and China was behind. In Lin Baohua's serve, with a slide, it became four to four. They each added one more game, making it five to five, and six to six. Each time England won first, our country followed. In the twelfth game, Lin and Qiu's left and right strikes in front of the net were cunning and skillful, which was a spectacle. As a result, the spirits were lifted, and the momentum shifted, first seizing Bonnicuf's serve. In the next game, our country won three points first, and lost three points in a row. Relying on Lin's two successful high-pressure shots, they turned defeat into victory with a score of eight to six.</p>
<p>(Soaring Upward) In the third set, De Vere served first. In the first four games, each won by serving, making it two to two. Afterwards, there were many suicides. Lin and Qiu's brilliance became more and more prominent, and they handled the situation with ease, winning four consecutive games and winning with a score of six to two, taking very little time. China took the lead with a score of two to one.</p>
<p>(Final Decisive Battle) In the next set, they fell into a difficult battle again, and there was a long competition in each game. De Vere served first again, and the server always won the game, taking turns until five to five. Bonnicuf's serve suddenly failed, and China took the lead with six to five. Unexpectedly, Qiu Feihai's serve also failed, making it six to six again. It was getting late, but the audience's enthusiasm was undiminished, and they clapped and cheered non-stop. The situation became more and more tense. For the sake of prudence, spectators were not allowed to move around the edge of the field, let alone make noise. The whole place was silent. Shen Siliang also advocated changing to a new ball to determine the final outcome. It was Bonnicuf's turn to serve at this time. It was quite inappropriate to change the ball at this time, because it was unfavorable to China. However, because it was the home team, Lin and Qiu could only agree. They were extra careful, and Lin worked extra hard. The opponent guarded the net tightly. Lin skillfully lobbed the ball, disrupting the opponent's strategy. As expected, they seized the game with four to one. Qiu served, and completed it with four to one again. As a result, they won with a score of nine to seven.</p>

<p>Youyou won over Tongji... 15 to 0</p>
<p>Youyou won completely in yesterday's match against Tongji. With the most points, they lead the heroes. This championship is like an item in a bag. The second doubles team, Liu Keng and Liang Guanying, is invincible and can also win personal awards. If so, it would be a double celebration.</p>

<p>The competition was fierce, and the highlights were particularly evident. Yukuai had a balanced win-loss ratio in the two singles matches. However, the second doubles team suffered a crushing defeat of zero to three, which was very damaging. Fortunately, the third doubles team won two to one. In the first doubles match, the struggle was protracted. After Yukuai won the first set, the second set fought desperately, holding each other until 5 o'clock. The sky was dim and it was difficult to distinguish black and white, so they announced a break and will continue the battle today. Checking the scores, Youyi has 7 points, and Yukuai has 6 points, with a difference of only one point. In terms of the situation, although Youyi is currently leading, Yukuai's first doubles team seems to be better. If they can defeat the enemy, they may be able to reverse the defeat into victory. It all depends on everyone's efforts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, because the main player of the railway team, Guo Qida, was slightly uncomfortable, his performance declined. After being defeated by Chen Chuanzhang of Shanghai in two consecutive sets, he was physically exhausted and had to abandon the game. The total score was a narrow victory of eight to seven.

<p>Restore Shandong University Aid</p>
<p>But Reduce 4,000 Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, previously stated that due to the financial difficulties of the province, and because Shandong University students did not undergo military training, the Provincial Government's annual disaster relief aid of 360,000 yuan was suspended from July. The central government, Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, and Minister of Education Wang Shijie, had repeatedly telegraphed to request that the aid be maintained as before. Wang also sent Li Shengwu, Director of the International Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to Lu, carrying Wang's personal letter to Han, reiterating the previous situation. Han, because of the difficulty in rejecting the requests from all parties, and because most of the students of the university were from Qilu, agreed to restore the aid. However, the number hoped for by all circles should be reduced to save public funds. It is proposed to reduce 4,000 yuan per month, which is 312,000 yuan for the whole year. This intention was telegraphed to Wang, and Wang replied, stating that he was very pleased to have maintained the aid to Shandong University, and that the reduction hoped for by all circles would be seriously considered. The university is now expanding the College of Engineering and opening a College of Agriculture, both of which require funds. As the finances of Shandong Province are very difficult, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance should instruct the university to tighten up its budget. It is hoped that the funds will be allocated as before this year. Han stated that Premier Wang had agreed to reduce the aid to Shandong University by 4,000 yuan per month and should be obeyed. Today (24th), the provincial government's political affairs meeting was held to discuss and approve it.</p>

<p>Achievement Exhibition Postponement Reasons</p>
<p>Due to Problems at the Venue</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education planned to hold a national vocational school and primary and secondary school labor course achievement exhibition in October this year. It previously ordered all provinces and cities to hold this achievement exhibition in their own provinces and cities in advance in order to select excellent achievements and send them to the exhibition. The Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau has scheduled to hold the city's vocational school and primary and secondary school labor course achievement exhibition starting from September 1st to prepare for selecting products to send to the exhibition. In addition, other provinces and cities that have submitted relevant products to the Ministry of Education, there are currently fifteen or six provinces and cities that are expected to send products for display, which may be twenty or thirty provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education has appointed supervisors and section chiefs as preparatory members to preside over the preparation matters. However, due to the sudden occurrence of problems in borrowing the venue, the Lizhi Society's house has been borrowed by the Ministry of Health in advance, and after the Central University Gymnasium starts, students need to exercise. The Examination Yuan's test site is pre-borrowed by the Audit Department and the Judicial Administration Department for the use of examiners and judges. There will be an Examination and Selection Conference in November, and it is said that the exhibition has now been decided to be postponed to December (approximately from the 1st to the 10th for the exhibition period).

<p>Situation of the Evening Class of the School of Commerce and Politics</p>
<p>The evening class of the School of Commerce and Politics at the west end of Xinjiayuan, Xinzha Road in this city, was jointly founded by Xu Peikun, former Dean of the National School of Commerce, Professor Xiong Dahui, Shen Liren, Shen Zouting, Sheng Jinjie, Li Chunquei, Zhu Zhongming, Shen Hongchen, Zhang Jiasu, former Director of Studies of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Night School, Xu Huanren, acting principal, Zhang Debao, Tao Shiying, Huang Jingxian, Xia Songui, and others. Yesterday, the school held its first school affairs meeting. More than 20 people, including Ji Xinde, Tu Xingyuan, and Lin Liangqing, attended. The meeting was chaired by Principal Xu Peikun and recorded by Zhu Zhongming. It was decided on the spot that (1) in order to increase the effectiveness of teaching, the number of students in each class should be limited to 40; (2) registration will start from today; (3) a screening test will be held on September 5th and 6th for class placement; (4) the school will open on the 10th. It is also heard that the teachers of the school are all concurrently held by the founders, most of whom have studied in the United States and have served as professors in the business schools of various universities after returning to China. They have rich experience and are indeed a good opportunity for those who seek knowledge.</p>

<p>Industrial and Commercial Management Tutorial School</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is a thriving center of industry and commerce, there is still a perceived lack of talent in industrial and commercial management. Consequently, industrial and commercial leaders who wish to implement new management methods often feel a scarcity of talent. Similarly, employees in the industrial and commercial sectors who aspire to study new management methods often lament the lack of accessible learning opportunities. This truly represents a major obstacle to the development of China's industry and commerce. In light of this, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Management Association and the United Association of Machinery and National Goods Factories have jointly initiated the establishment of an Industrial and Commercial Management Tutorial School, with the aim of cultivating specialized talent in this field and seeking reform for China's industrial and commercial sectors. It is reported that they have already selected No. 43 Jing'an Temple Road as the school's location and are actively preparing for enrollment.</p>
<h3 id="e198">News from Various Schools <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Nanxiang Vocational School Located in Nanxiang Town on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Line, this school was specially established to benefit young students. This summer, it has provisionally established a first-grade general commercial course. Yang Zhuofu, the director of training at the Shanghai China Vocational School, was invited to administer the entrance examination. The number of applicants was quite enthusiastic, but the school's selection process was strict, admitting only over thirty students. For the second entrance examination, the school invited the director of academic affairs and the director of the commercial department of the Shanghai China Vocational School to administer the test. Currently, due to the limited number of available slots, the registration process has been quite crowded in recent days.</p>
<p>Wuxi Association in Shanghai Evening Tutorial School Located at No. 218, North Henan Road, Qipu Road, this school was established by the Wuxi Association in Shanghai to benefit fellow townsmen's children, allowing them to utilize their evening leisure time to supplement their knowledge in applied commercial skills. The school has been in operation for several years, and the number of fellow townsmen's children studying there has been quite enthusiastic. Moreover, tuition is completely free. The new semester is scheduled to begin on September 6th. It is reported that there are still vacancies in various grades. Those interested in supplementary studies can be introduced by a member of the association to register.</p>
<p>Cihang Midwifery School Cihang Midwifery School, located at the northern end of Kang Nao Tuo Road, Hede Road, has greatly expanded this semester. It has now rented the former site of the Jiangnan Physical Education School as its campus. Repairs are currently being actively carried out to facilitate an early start to the semester. It is reported that the number of students recommended to the school by education authorities in various provinces and cities this semester is increasing daily.</p>
<p>Minguang Middle School Since reducing tuition fees and establishing scholarship amounts, the number of students enrolling at Minguang Middle School, located at the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Jiaozhou Road, has been unexpectedly enthusiastic, especially among female students. Therefore, the girls' dormitory has been expanded with additional spacious buildings. Yesterday (the 25th) was the examination date, and the number of examinees exceeded the quota. Initially, enrollment was to be stopped, but due to numerous letters from students in other areas requesting an extension and asking for an increase in the number of slots, Principal Tang consulted with Chairman Wu Xingya of the school board to extend the deadline by six days to August 31st, in order to assist students from afar seeking educational opportunities.</p>
<p>Guoji Primary School Guoji Primary School, located on Huining Road in Southern Shanghai, has been established for nine years. Recently, due to student growth, the school has expanded its campus, moving to a new, spacious location near Huairen Lane across the street. Facilities have been further improved. New student registration has been continuous. It is expected that enrollment will reach over 300 students this semester. Principal Fan, considering the inadequacy of the original number of classes, plans to hire additional teachers and open one or two more classes.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Strategies for Medical Development (Continued) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>(Decimos) Unite All Factions for a Grand Unity. The discussion of medical factions has been confusing for some time. All of us in the profession are aware of it. The idea of unity has been mentioned repeatedly. However, the reason why it has not yet been realized is that the opinions of various factions have not been fully aligned. It is not necessary for everyone to be of one mind, but if we concentrate our strength, it will be easier to achieve success. Otherwise, there will be discord, with some dominating and others being subservient. Opinions will fill the room, but no consensus will be reached. The implementation of any matter will inevitably face opposition from different factions, which will hinder progress from all sides. Therefore, if the medical community wants to have a massive force and the development of new medicine, it is essential to integrate all factions and achieve a grand unity.</p>
<p>(Zi) Eliminate Undesirable Elements. In any organization, there will inevitably be a mixture of good and bad elements. The good ones will devote their minds and efforts to seeking the happiness of the organization. The undesirable ones, however, will use their jealousy and harmful abilities to pursue their ambitions of vying for power and profit. If they are not satisfied, they will not hesitate to resort to disruptive measures to engage in sabotage. Therefore, if these elements are not removed, it will be difficult for the organization's undertakings to succeed. We must concentrate our efforts on conducting on-site investigations. If we discover any individuals who are plotting conspiracies or falsely using the organization's name to engage in deceitful activities, we must deal with them and expel them. In this way, the internal affairs will be cleared up, and we will not be burdened by harmful elements.</p>
<p>(Chou) Research Methods to Protect the Medical Profession. Doctors should possess the necessary ethics and enjoy the rights and benefits they deserve. However, the so-called medical rights have their own special position and cannot be encompassed by ordinary human rights. Ordinary laws impose heavy penalties for injury, intimidation, and the use of anesthetics and narcotics. However, due to the nature of their work, doctors have no way to avoid the aforementioned items. Therefore, if doctors do these things, they should not be considered as breaking the law. However, while this phenomenon gives doctors a special status, there is no clear provision in the law. As a result, doctors are constantly in a state of violating the law without real protection. In recent years, medical disputes have become increasingly frequent. Doctors are constantly appearing in court for treating patients. If we do not find ways to protect them, then any autopsy, any surgery, any injection, any change of wording can become grounds for accusations. We must urge the government to promulgate a law to protect doctors as soon as possible. At the same time, we must, from the organization's perspective, refer to the established rules of Western countries and combine them with our country's customs and traditions to conduct thorough research on methods to protect the medical profession, so as to provide a reference for the government. In this way, the medical profession will have a defense and will not be subject to innocent infringements at any time.</p>
<p>(Yin) Limit the Production of Unofficial Doctors. As worms live in wood and destroy the wood, so do quack doctors destroy medicine. This is why we have been sternly refuting unofficial doctors for many years. When we examine the reasons for their emergence, we find that some are nurses from hospitals, some are apprentices of private individuals, some are from correspondence medical schools, and some are from medical schools with incomplete facilities. All of these are sources of unofficial doctors, and the responsibility for them should be borne by official doctors. If we want to promote a career, we must first engage in internal rectification. If we want to eliminate a disease, we must first cut off its roots. If we can use the strength of the organization to provide appropriate training for existing unofficial doctors and prevent the continued emergence of future unofficial doctors, then after the old ones gradually decrease, China's medical community will naturally return to purity.</p>
<p>In summary, the above thirteen items, although they are clichés, are actually necessary strategies for medical proposals. Although medicine is a small path, it is of utmost importance to the revival of the nation. Only with a healthy people can we talk about ways to strengthen the country and the race and ways to wipe out humiliation and resist insults. The responsibility borne by the medical community is not insignificant. Therefore, medical development, on a small scale, is to seek independence and development for the medical community; on a large scale, it is to seek health and revival for the entire nation. Otherwise, why would we expand and enlarge the affairs of one sector to call it development?</p>
<p>Someone asked, "There are thousands of things in the medical community that need to be implemented. You have only mentioned thirteen items. Aren't you missing a lot?" I do not know that these thirteen items can actually encompass everything and are the foundation of medical development. Why do I say this? Education is the source of talent and the foundation of all undertakings. When the foundation is deep, the tree will be lush. When the source is far, the stream will be long. Therefore, we must first focus on medical education. The most important thing in medical education is to establish curriculum standards. With standards, talent can tend to be consistent. The most important thing in standards is to emphasize both academic theory and experience. When both are emphasized, the treatment of diseases can be guaranteed to be safe. However, this is related to academics, and the cultivation of morality is even more important. Therefore, it is necessary to add a course on medical ethics. Unqualified medical schools have been improved and eliminated due to non-compliance with standards. It is even more necessary to add qualified medical schools to prepare for the emergence of official doctors. In this way, all aspects will be taken care of, and the problem of medical education seems to be solvable. As for medical administration, it is of great importance to the interests of medical affairs throughout the country. The most important medical institution in the country is the hospital. Therefore, we must first formulate hospital standards and then use this goal as a target to eliminate those that do not meet the standards and increase those that meet the standards. The greatest enemies of the medical community are the inherent old doctors and the imported foreign doctors. If we restrict them at the same time, then medical administration can avoid divergence, and the rights and interests will not flow out. Then, we can proceed to promulgate laws and regulations to protect new medicine without any obstacles. The above items are all things that the government should do. There are also things that have nothing to do with the government and need to be done by our medical community ourselves, and that is the medical association. Although the medical association has no political background, it has a personal stake in the matter. It is different from those who have nothing to do with it. Since it is called an organization, there can be no phenomenon of factional divisions. Therefore, we must first unite with sincerity. Only after unity can we eliminate undesirable elements and limit the production of unofficial doctors. As for the research on methods to protect the medical profession, it is an important task of the medical association. The medical association is in a position to serve the medical community and has a consulting position for the government. It cannot be ignored simply because it is an organization of one sector.</p>
<p>From this perspective, these thirteen items are actually fundamental strategies and have continuity and correspondence. Over the years, medical colleagues and I have spoken about them repeatedly, but they have not yet been put into practice. Therefore, I have specially reorganized them and listed them item by item for the reference of those who care about the progress of medical affairs.</p>
<p>The first paragraph (Decimos) should be placed before "Medical Organization Aspect" in the previous issue (3). Special correction is made.</p>
<p>P&gt; Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases</p>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(3) (10) (7) Chronic Habitual Constipation</p>
<p>(Q) What is called chronic habitual constipation?</p>
<p>(A) Chronic habitual constipation is a disease in which feces are retained in the large intestine for a long time due to functional impairment.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) There are many causes of chronic habitual constipation. First, it is eating too much meat, eggs, refined flour, and other foods that lack fiber. Second, it is due to excessive use of enemas. Third, it is due to physical constitution or opium addiction, which reduces the peristaltic function of the intestines. Fourth, it is spasm of the large intestine muscles. Fifth, it is persistent organic diseases of other organs, such as gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, cholecystitis, chronic appendicitis, gynecological diseases, prostate disease, hemorrhoids, and anal fissures. Sixth, endocrine disorders, such as pregnancy and hypothyroidism, are also causes.</p>
<p>(Q) Are the symptoms of this chronic habitual constipation the same?</p>
<p>(A) They are not uniform. In some cases, the feces only remain in the cecum, ascending colon, and the right one-third of the transverse colon, while the rest of the large intestine remains empty. In some cases, the passage of feces is very slow. In some cases, spasms occur in the transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon, causing the intestinal wall to collapse. In some cases, the entire large intestine has no abnormalities, and only the rectum lacks sensation, making it difficult to feel the urge to defecate.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of chronic habitual constipation?</p>
<p>(A) Bowel movements are very slow, feces form hard lumps, there is a feeling of bloating in the abdomen, a heavy feeling in the head, congestion in the head, general fatigue, aversion to work, insomnia, and loss of appetite.</p>
<p>(Q) Can habitual constipation be corrected by changing habits?</p>
<p>(A) Yes. Patients should go to the toilet at a fixed time every day to develop a habit. Over time, they can be on time.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>for bowel movements.</p>
<p>(Q) Can this disease be treated with diet therapy?</p>
<p>(A) Diet therapy is effective in children, but less effective in the elderly. It is even less effective in those who use strong laxatives frequently.</p>
<p>(Q) What foods have a laxative effect?</p>
<p>(A) There are many kinds of such foods, but they are only effective for constipation caused by intestinal muscle relaxation. Such as sugars (honey, sweet fruits, candies, etc.), organic acids (citric acid, sour fruits), salts, mineral water, soda water, fats, cod liver oil, olive oil, plant fiber (vegetables, soybeans, etc.), and cold drinks.</p>
<p>(Q) What medicines can be used to effectively treat habitual constipation?</p>
<p>(A) In drug treatment, it is necessary to first determine whether the constipation is spastic or atonic. Only after determining this can a prescription be given.</p>
<p>(Q) What medicine should be used for spastic habitual constipation?</p>
<p>(A) For spastic constipation, bromine preparations, hyoscyamus preparations, atropine, papaverine, etc. should be used.</p>
<p>(Q) What medicine should be used for atonic habitual constipation?</p>
<p>(A) For atonic constipation, laxatives can be taken, but it is best not to use them. Some laxatives are temporary, such as castor oil, senna leaf infusion, and magnesium sulfate. Those that can be used permanently include lactose, olive oil, liquid paraffin, rhubarb powder, calcined magnesium, peroxidized magnesium, and cascara extract.</p>
<p>(Q) What method should be used to treat cases where it is difficult to feel the urge to defecate due to a lack of sensation in the rectum alone?</p>
<p>(A) An enema can be performed at this time. The method is to use 5 to 20 cubic centimeters of glycerin, diluted with twice the amount of water, and inject it into the anus. Alternatively, soapy water (2-3%), pure water, salt water, olive oil, sesame oil, etc. can be used for the enema. (The end)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Casual Remarks on Vaccination <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Zang Hebai</p>
<p>Vaccination is a very common, very old, and very democratic matter, without any class system. I remember that Mr. Cheng Hanzhang and others have already published its theory and operation methods, so there is no need for me to turn on the record player and repeat it again. Now I will talk about the general public's misunderstanding of the original intention of vaccination and the various matters that occur during vaccination!</p>
<p>Our purpose of vaccination is to prevent the spread of smallpox. In other words, it is because smallpox is a disease that, once infected, there is no particularly effective medicine to cure it. If the nursing care is improper and the process is not good, it will be fatal and very dangerous! After vaccination, one will not be infected with this terrible disease within a certain period of time! It does not mean that after vaccination, all sores, boils, ringworm, ulcers, eczema, and rot, as well as symptoms that occur in internal medicine diseases, such as edema, sallow complexion, and loss of appetite, will not occur! If one does not develop sores, boils, ringworm, ulcers, eczema, and rot, as well as symptoms that occur in internal medicine diseases, such as edema, sallow complexion, and loss of appetite, after vaccination; then it should not be called vaccination, but should be called sore planting, boil planting, etc. The name itself is fundamentally wrong! Therefore, it is wrong to expect vaccination to prevent diseases other than smallpox.</p>
<p>The old method of vaccination is already outdated; because its serum and its technique do not conform to the principles of disinfection, there is a risk of spreading other diseases. Except for the general ignorant people who are still practicing the old tricks in remote areas, it should no longer exist in large cities. However, the fact tells us that the words "Mr. So-and-so has received cowpox vaccination by the Chinese method and is transmitting the serum on a certain day" are still often sent to our eyes. In the lower and middle classes, being bewitched by him and becoming his patron can be said to be a lack of common knowledge, which is not to be blamed! What is most incredible is that some people who have received scientific training also become his patrons, reversing the course without knowing it, which is truly contradictory!</p>
<p>In the mouths of these old-fashioned cowpox vaccination doctors, they say, "The old-fashioned cowpox vaccination is thorough, and you don't need to be vaccinated twice in your life," but when we revaccinate people, we encounter many, many people who have been vaccinated with the old-fashioned cowpox and still develop the disease. My wife and my nephew are good examples. They were all vaccinated with the old-fashioned cowpox thirty or twenty years ago. In the past ten years, I have vaccinated them, and they have all developed the disease twice. Where is the "thorough"? Furthermore, when we see patients with smallpox, it is true that many cases occur because their guardians neglected to vaccinate their children in time. However, there are also many, many cases of people in their decades of age who develop smallpox. Did they not receive the old-fashioned cowpox vaccination decades ago? Where is the saying "you don't need to be vaccinated twice in your life"?</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (18) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 7 General Symptoms of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Speaking of the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, it fits well with an old Chinese saying: a complete twenty-four history, I really don't know where to start. It is a matter of thousands of threads. I dare to say boldly that almost all disease symptoms can be directly or indirectly attributed to pulmonary tuberculosis. Its course is mostly chronic; in the beginning, it is mostly latent, and there are few obvious symptoms that can be guessed at a glance. Sometimes the patient coughs and feels difficulty in expectorating phlegm, which is the same as ordinary "tracheobronchitis"; many patients feel that this is a bit of a cold, and of course they will not pay special attention to it. Sometimes there are no other symptoms except for poor appetite, and everyone treats this as "gastritis." Some women have a pale complexion and irregular menstruation. These few symptoms easily lead people to imagine "chlorosis." Sometimes there is insomnia, fatigue, and poor appetite, which are very similar to ordinary "neurasthenia." These are all common and habitual, but this point alone has made patients confused; even the correct understanding of doctors is also very difficult. In addition, we know that the beginning of pulmonary tuberculosis is mostly inseparable from the hilar lymph nodes; this aspect is of course close to the nerves. If the vagus nerve (the tenth cranial nerve) is compressed by the swollen gland, then the patient will experience palpitations and severe stomach pain, and it is also difficult to imagine that these symptoms are related to the lungs. Night sweats are comparatively considered to be an obvious symptom of the beginning of the disease, but it is sometimes present in neurasthenia. Based on these facts, we can know that the initial condition of this disease is all-encompassing; a firm diagnosis of right and wrong is certainly not possible for a while; even the determination of the initial date of onset, I am afraid that no one can completely answer.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned symptoms are indeed pulmonary tuberculosis, then of course they will not stop for no reason; they will flourish from then on. As time goes by, the patient gradually becomes thinner and lighter; if the patient has a little common sense, they will know that they should measure their body temperature. If the result is indeed increasing, and it is very average every day; they also know that this phenomenon is definitely not without cause, and of course they must seek a doctor to examine it in detail. However, most patients still do not pay much attention; and the symptom of elevated body temperature is not felt by the patient himself except when measured with a thermometer. It was not until the symptoms of coughing and sputum in the lungs themselves became more and more obvious, the weight loss was even greater, or blood streaks were found in the sputum, that this cough with blood symptoms was almost like a final warning to the patient. At this time, the patients also know that they can no longer be careless; but the root of tuberculosis has already reached a considerable degree, and it can be asserted that the treatment is not as easy as it was at the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Common Sense on Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Hygiene <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(12) Lacunar Tonsillitis</p>
<p>The hypertrophy and proliferation of the tonsils have already been discussed in the previous two issues. Now, we will talk about its inflammation. This inflammation has various names in clinical practice due to the differences in its location and pathology. The type of tonsillitis discussed in this article is an acute infectious palatine tonsillitis, which is the most common type of tonsillitis (generally, the term “mammary moth swelling” or “sore throat” in common parlance mostly refers to this disease). This disease occurs most often in adults around the age of twenty to thirty. It is less common in children. There is no gender correlation; it cannot be said that it occurs more in men or less in women. People with tonsillar hypertrophy are more susceptible to this disease. Conversely, it is rare in the elderly whose tonsils have already undergone physiological atrophy. This disease is related to rheumatism (commonly known as rheumatic pain), which is a fact recognized by the medical community recently. Having had tonsillitis once does not mean it will not occur a second time, and it may even occur frequently. This can be called habitual angina (Angina habitualis). This disease is often epidemic, so it is frequently encountered in families, schools, armies, prisons, and other places. Its main infectious pathogen is streptococcus, followed by staphylococcus and pneumococcus. This disease is also related to the climate. For example, it is more likely to occur in humid and cold climates and drastic temperature changes. Therefore, statistically, it is most common in August and September, followed by October, November, December, January, and July. The onset of the disease usually begins with chills and shivering, followed by fever, often reaching around 40 degrees Celsius. At the same time, there is a feeling of pain in the throat, which is even more intense when swallowing. Sleep is restless at night. The pain often spreads to the ears, so patients often hold their ears with their hands, showing a look of distress. Speech and diet become inconvenient. The whole body falls into a state of fatigue. There is headache, back pain, thirst, bad breath, and swelling of the submandibular lymph nodes with tenderness. The tongue is coated with a white fur. At this time, if the pharyngeal cavity is examined, the palatine tonsils can be seen to be significantly swollen and congested (usually on both sides). At the location of the crypts, there are small white or light yellowish-white spots of purulent plugs. If the purulent plugs are examined under a microscope, streptococcus or staphylococcus can be seen. These small dotted purulent plugs can often combine into a membrane, covering the surface of the tonsils. The appearance is the same as diphtheria, so patients often mistake it for diphtheria and seek medical treatment from a doctor.</p>
<p>The course of the disease, if good, can be alleviated after a few days of treatment (such as a decrease in temperature, a reduction in pain, and the tonsils subsiding and decongesting). Complete cure usually takes about a week. However, it is common for the body temperature to suddenly rise on the second or third day after the various symptoms have subsided, and the various symptoms reappear. This is probably due to the occurrence of peritonsillar inflammation. Peritonsillar inflammation can also turn into a peritonsillar abscess. At this time, surgery must be performed to drain the pus and heal the disease. Peritonsillar inflammation and peritonsillar abscess may be described in detail in the next issue.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of this disease, it can be divided into five points: 1. Oral medication = After a specialist physician has examined and determined the disease, quinine can be taken immediately. The dosage can be determined by the physician's prescription. I cannot arbitrarily give a certain dosage. This is determined according to age and physical condition. Its benefit is that it can shorten the course of the disease and make it easier to recover. 2. Local therapy = can be divided into three types: topical medicine, gargling medicine, and compress method. These are all matters under the guidance of a physician. 3. In the case of habitual angina, it is best to perform a tonsillectomy or removal. 4. Patients with rheumatism must tell the doctor whether they have had this disease before. Even if they have not, they should ask the doctor to examine the tonsils, because there is often a related relationship. 5. Be cautious about receiving diphtheria antitoxin injections. When I am in clinical practice, when I encounter families with patients suffering from tonsillitis, they often say, "I have already been injected with diphtheria antitoxin, why is it still not effective?" At this time, it is difficult for me to judge. I cannot say that the doctor who injected the diphtheria antitoxin is wrong, nor can I criticize the poor quality of the antitoxin. However, I hope that readers of the newspaper will pay attention to three points: A. Diphtheria antitoxin is only uniquely effective for diphtheria. It is not effective for tonsillitis. B. If a doctor wants to inject diphtheria antitoxin, it is best to rely on a microscopic examination report (that is, whether there are diphtheria bacilli). C. Patients suffering from tonsillitis who have already been injected with diphtheria antitoxin are not in any danger, only losing money and the credibility of the antitoxin. However, when injecting any antitoxin for the second time, it is best to tell the doctor, stating that they were injected with diphtheria antitoxin on such and such a date in such and such a month of such and such a year, because this can draw the doctor's attention and prevent a reaction to the antitoxin.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: A Carriage of Distant Guests Arrives from Guanzhong; A Penniless Family Crosses the Ferry, Lamenting the Men of Qin</p>
<p>By the time he recollected himself, this long stretch of road was straight and flat. In five minutes, they had already traveled six or seven *li*. He shouted, “Oh dear! I've lost my hat. Please stop the carriage.” Zhao Guofu said, “Can you ask a foreigner sitting in the front to stop the carriage?” Li Shilian said, “What's there to fear about foreigners? I see foreigners all day long in Shanghai. In the concessions, it's only the British, Americans, and French with whom diplomacy is difficult. But with White Russians, you can joke around. The Germans have no power now, what's there to fear about them?” Zhao and Wang, who both worked for Germans, were not convinced by these words. But since the European War, Germans really had no power in China. How could they deny that? So, Wang Laowu attacked from the side, asking, “If you met Japanese people, would you dare joke with them too?” Li Shilian said, “Unless I met them in Hongkou, Shanghai, where they run rampant. If I met them in the French Concession, I doubt they'd dare do anything.” After this long discourse on foreign affairs, the carriage traveled further and further, and his hat could only be sacrificed in vain, left unattended. But after being subtly ridiculed a few times by Wang Laowu, knowing that he was supporting the Germans, he thought, "These two people's thinking is truly worthy of making them traitors. Two utter snobs." Wang Laowu was also thinking, “This rash fellow is also coming to Shaanxi to look for work. If he really gets a job in Shaanxi, then that place must be three feet high in the sky.” So they looked at each other with cold eyes, and both fell silent. Zhang Jiefu, with his hands pillowed on the wooden box, was also lost in thought. Suddenly, he heard a crackling sound from the basket, not knowing what kind of glass or porcelain had broken. Then, a whiff of wine wafted toward his nose. His lifelong fondness was for a sip of wine; his nickname was "Wine-Crazy Zhang San." On this windy, dusty, sun-baked carriage, he didn’t know what to do. (5)</p>

<p>Red represents danger, green indicates safety.</p>
<p>At every intersection, traffic lights always stare like strange eyes, watching all those who come and go in the tiger's mouth-like intersection for fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Traffic controllers wrapped in uniforms turn off the red light and turn on the green light. Trams and cars, like armored vehicles and tanks, rush to the front lines recklessly.</p>
<p>Following them are bicycles, rickshaws, and finally, people hobbling on two lame legs.</p>
<p>From here, the authority of science is fully demonstrated. Those using electricity and motors have defeated those relying solely on mechanical things. Those hobbling on two legs are, of course, the most backward.</p>
<p>The green light turns off, the red light turns on, and the vehicles and pedestrians on the cross street are also in such a scene.</p>
<p>This is the mechanization of order at the intersection, which is the so-called "safety first."</p>
<p>Red represents danger, green indicates safety.</p>
<p>But some people cross the street under the red light, and some people bleed crimson blood and milky white brain matter at the tiger's mouth-like intersection.</p>
<p>Unless they are lifeless, even if they have only a trace of life left, they will be scolded as "dying unjustly" and "swine" because the red light stares like strange eyes, indicating danger long ago.</p>
<p>Vehicles and pedestrians on the road come and go non-stop. Red and green lights take turns indicating the safe road for people.</p>
<p>Traffic lights are responsible for the safety of pedestrians’ lives, serving all day long, until people rest. Only then do they slightly close those two strange eyes.</p>
<p>But at daybreak, the two strange eyes are open at the intersection again.</p>

<p>Today, the whole country holds a memorial ceremony for the birth of Confucius. The central government has specially dispatched an official to Qufu to offer sacrifices, which shows the solemnity of the etiquette. Commemorating the Most Sage Teacher, our country has always regarded this as the most solemn and solemn ceremony. However, it was once cold for the past seven years. Now the central government has reiterated the significance of respecting Confucius. After all, the great and lofty teacher of all ages is respected by people, but formal commemoration is ultimately not as good as spiritual emulation. Therefore, the teacher's morality, learning, and career should be the guiding principles for us to practice.</p>

<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>In the small teahouse near the vegetable market street, it is crowded with people in the evening. Under the emerald green gaslight, mostly figures from the business community are reflected, either shopkeepers or bosses. Everyone gathers to chat casually, talk about business, or make deals.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone came to listen to Mr. [Storyteller] tell the story of "Three Smiles," but this Mr. [Storyteller] was called to sing for a private party at Chen's mansion and couldn't get away for a while. Therefore, these listeners couldn’t avoid having to wait for a long time, and began to talk loudly, drowning out even the buzzing of the mosquitoes in the corner.</p>
<p>A butcher with a scraggly beard said, "In these years, schools have been very patriotic. Others don't need to be mentioned, but just take the principal of that XX Middle School. He can truly be called a patriotism expert. No matter how hot the weather is, under the scorching sun, he tears his throat and gives speeches, his head full of sweat and tears streaming down. How difficult that is!"</p>
<p>A bald man sitting next to him, holding a handful of watermelon seeds, scattered them on the table and chimed in, "That principal is really something. You only need to listen to him talk about boycotting Japanese goods, regaining rights, enduring hardship to restore the country, and five-minute fever. What kind of reasoning he speaks. I was very moved after hearing his words!"</p>
<p>They were talking loudly when a foreign goods store owner was disturbed. He ran over from the next table and asked, "Are you talking about that principal?" The butcher said, "Yes! We say he is a patriotism expert." The foreign goods store owner snorted in his nose and said, "Don't mention it! I know everything about this Mr. [Principal]. He says he doesn't buy foreign goods, but his woman cut dozens of dollars worth of printed eastern gauze in my store yesterday. The end of the month is tomorrow, and I still have to prepare to go to his door to collect the account!"</p>
<p>Everyone talked more and more excitedly. The eyes and ears of almost all the guests were focused on this corner. Suddenly, the sound of strings rang out with a *ding-ding-dong-dong*. It turned out that the storyteller had come on stage. Everyone wanted to listen to the story of Wang Laohu snatching the bride and what Zhou Wenbin was doing in his sister's room, so it was quiet without a sound, only slightly some sounds of eating watermelon seeds and the mosquitoes buzzing in the corner, echoing the storyteller's string music.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After the boned and scaled crucian carp meat was cooked with tender tofu, it was presented to the Empress Dowager for the second time: she used a silver spoon to drink several spoonfuls in a row, and at the same time praised it with audible relish, making those of us standing beside her drool. Later, she suddenly specified that half of what was left should be given to me to eat. This really made me overjoyed! Because if the Empress Dowager specified that leftovers or tea that was left over should be given to someone to eat, that person's worth would suddenly increase a lot; not only would others envy him, but he himself would also consider it an extremely honorable thing. So the Empress Dowager left half of this fresh fish soup for me to eat, which was really delightful: what's more, the taste of the fish soup cooked with tender tofu was indeed very good?</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager's appetite did not decrease as much as that of ordinary elderly people, there were so many things presented by the Imperial Kitchen that she could not finish eating or drinking everything, whether it was a bowl of dishes or a cup of soup; as a result, she developed the habit of giving the leftovers to the people who served her. However, I always dealt with this kind of grace very carefully: if she had not told me to eat or drink the leftovers, no matter how much I loved to eat or drink in my heart, I would try my best to endure it and immediately hand the original bowl or cup to the eunuchs to clean up; if she had already told me clearly to eat or drink the leftovers, then I could no longer be polite, and I must first respectfully kowtow to her to show that I was twelve minutes satisfied and grateful for her reward, and then eat and drink what was left in the bowl or cup without hesitation. No matter how full I was, I had to obey gladly, otherwise it would be violating the imperial decree, a crime that could not be pardoned. (114)</p>

<p>Men have too many opportunities to suffer setbacks in these years.</p>
<p>To cite two simple examples: Film companies’ actresses appear one by one, and are praised and supported one by one, but what about actors? The actors' skills are not necessarily lower than those of the actresses, and the number of people working in the industry is not necessarily less than that of the actresses, but the actors who were successful in the past are now dull. Every year, schools hold queen elections and produce school flowers. Photos of the queens and school flowers are to be published in various pictorials, and outstanding female students must also be published. What about male students? Are there fewer outstanding male students than female students? But pictorials always abandon them.</p>
<p>But is the popularity of women a good phenomenon in society? Does the popularity of women mean that women's status has improved?</p>

<h3 id="e209">Speech on Sacrificing to Confucius in Shanghai <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai General News Agency</p>
<p>This year, in order to promote Confucius's deeds and to express reverence, the central government specially proposed the 132nd Standing Committee Meeting, which decided that August 27th would be the anniversary of the birth of the first teacher Confucius, and issued a notice to all local party and government agencies to prepare for the commemoration. On that day, the Municipal Party Department will jointly convene representatives from all walks of life in conjunction with the Municipal Government to hold a memorial meeting in the Dacheng Hall of the Nanjing "Temple of Literature." On the one hand, in order to show solemnity, the National Government specially dispatched member Ye Chucang to Qufu to preside over the sacrifice on that day, and each of the five institutes and the two departments of education sent members to accompany the sacrifice. -- Originally, the "Ding Sacrifice" of sacrificial rites is to be seen again today.</p>
<p>Speaking of the sacrificial ceremony to Confucius in Shanghai, the "Wenmiao Ding Sacrifice Manual" has always been used as the standard. This manual is based on the Liling Ding Sacrifice Manual obtained by Shanghai gentry Wang Qingxun. In the Tongzhi year of Wuchen [1868], Su Aiding Richang published the manual in the provincial capital, and even the plates were collected and submitted, and stored in the Zunjing Pavilion. Later, it was reprinted after cleaning. At the end of the Guangxu era, the Ding Sacrifice was promoted to a major sacrifice, and the Ministry issued a martial dance manual. Its rituals, offerings, and music and dance aspects were slightly different from before, but Shanghai County "did not bother to change it." In the third year of the Republic of China [1914], the Ritual System Hall of the Department of Political Affairs issued diagrams of the sacrificial rites and costumes of Confucius, and the rituals and costumes were even more different than before. Therefore, Ding Xicheng, the director-general of the then Public Funds and Public Directors Management Office, together with Lin Zengyu, the custodian of the Temple of Literature, etc., deliberated on the past and present, planned the gains and losses, and the sacrificial rites of Confucius were splendidly complete. By the thirteenth year of the Republic of China [1924], Fan Yinshen, the director of music and dance at the Shanghai Confucius Temple, deeply aware that the situation had changed and the old Wenmiao Ding Sacrifice Manual was no longer completely applicable (and its plates were destroyed in the chaos of the Republic of China, leaving only one or two isolated copies), he began to compile the "Shanghai Sea Sacrifice Confucius Manual" with reference to the sacrificial rites of Confucius. The book was completed in half a year, and was published by the Sanitation Bureau in the summer of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China [1925].</p>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Sacrifice Confucius Manual," we will look at the style of the sacrificial rites of Confucius in Shanghai:</p>
<p>(1) Announcer - The main offering official, the sub-offering official, and the accompanying ceremonial officials take their positions one after another, and the ritual correction official ascends the steps to correct the rituals. Open the door to welcome the gods, raise the welcoming music, and kneel and bow four times to participate in the gods. Then present silk and wine to perform the first offering ceremony, raise the first offering music, and kneel and bow four times. The Martial Merit Dance retreats, and the Literary Virtue Dance advances. Perform the sub-offering ceremony, raise the sub-offering music. Perform the final offering ceremony, until the final offering music, and kneel and bow four times. The scribe holds the blessings, the silk official holds the silk, the wine official invites the wine, and the food official invites the food and respectfully sends them to the pyre. Close the door and the ceremony is completed.</p>
<p>(2) Musical Rhythm - Before the sacrifice, strike the Jin drum 360 times to warn. (Strike three times) After the musicians and dancers have taken their places under the steps, the shift drum is sounded. (There are thirteen sections in the drum score) The singers hold the tablets, the musicians hold the instruments and follow the flag in single file; the dancers hold the shields and axes and follow the rhythm in single file, advancing from both sides of the music rack in order, and each takes its place to welcome the gods. The Dacheng bells and drums sound together, and then the music is joined (there are six chapters in the music). The Welcome Gods play the Zhaohe chapter. The First Offering plays the Lihe chapter, and dances the Lihe dance. (First set) The Sub-Offering plays the Xihe chapter, and dances the Xihe dance. (Second set) The Final Offering plays the Yuanhe chapter, and dances the Yuanhe dance. (Third set) The Retreat Offering plays the Changhe chapter. Sending the Gods plays the Dehe chapter. Each time a chapter is played, the flag bearer raises the flag and sings loudly: The music plays the chapter of so-and-so. The sound should rise vigorously. The first two words are read, and the last four words are arranged evenly, the long rhyme gradually increases, the spring appearance is harmonious and elegant, the ending is long, and then strike the blessing three times to start the music.</p>
<p>(3) Dacheng Hall Blessing Text - There is a certain format, always: "Thinking that the first teacher's virtue participates in creation, and the Tao penetrates the past and the present. Collecting the great achievements of the sages, illuminating the former knowledge to set an example. The world is for the public, the measure of one person in China; what the people have never had before, the heart of the Six Classics for thousands of years. Following the palace walls to admire the beauty, entering the room and ascending the hall; offering sacrifices with respect, first understanding and then following the law, now…"</p>
<p>(4) Dacheng Hall Furnishings - There are nine kinds of sacrificial vessels: *jue* (wine cup), *bian* (bamboo container), *fu* (square sacrificial vessel), *gui* (round sacrificial vessel), *dou* (wooden stand), *xing* (cauldron), *fei* (basket), *zu* (altar), *deng* (pedestal); in addition to the Taigeng and Hegeng, there are thirty-two kinds of sacrificial offerings, and the setting position is divided into six rows. The Taigeng, which is loaded in the "Deng," is in the center of the fourth row, and the sheep, cattle, and pigs in the six rows of "Zu" face the three jade *jue* in the first row.</p>
<p>(5) Musicians' and Dancers' Costumes - The crown is black silk (or cotton), and the pure edges are all black with gold leaf (in each provincial place, the pure edges of the musicians and dancers do not use gold leaf), blue tassels without threads, the covering plate uses a square style, and the front, rear, left, and right are all placed flat with pointed corners. The crown badge is square, one inch in length and width, made of gilded copper, engraved with the seal characters "Music" and "Dance" in positive relief. The clothes are made of blue silk (or cotton), long to the ankles, and the width is each body; the sleeves are longer than the hands; the cuffs are six inches; the two overlaps of the sleeves are like straight collars; the collars and lower ends are all black edges for two guards: the collar pleats are from a flipped style, the waist pleats are behind, and the fat and thinness are about to be tied with a ribbon; the whole body continues to have small sunflower patterns. (Musicians and dancers in each provincial place are not embroidered). (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e210">Recent Shanghai Call Loan Interest Rates <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>The call loan interest rate is a yardstick for measuring the supply and demand situation in the Shanghai financial market. Before the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, this term was called "silver call loan." There was also a separate term, "foreign call loan," for the lending rate of silver dollars at that time, but now it has been unified. Its meaning is to calculate the daily interest rate per thousand yuan.</p>
<p>There are two types of Shanghai call loan rates: one set by the Banking Joint Reserve Committee and the other in the money changers' guild market. Due to historical and customary reasons, the former's check clearing situation is far inferior to the latter, with its clearing amount only one-fifth of the latter's. Even in general business circles and Chinese banks, the call loan rate set by the money changers' guild market is mostly used as the standard, so this article is based on the latter.</p>
<p>In the "silver call loan" era, the Shanghai Money Changers' Guild's business rules stipulated that the silver call loan rate should not exceed seven qian. Now it is stipulated that the call loan interest rate should not be higher than seven jiao. Looking back four or five years ago, a call loan interest rate of four or five qian was common, and it often reached the maximum limit when finances were active. However, after the January 28th Incident, the economic organization of Shanghai, and of the country, suffered a significant blow. At the same time, due to the impact of the international economic downturn, the financial situation changed to sluggishness, while the banking business showed a vigorous trend in reverse. The so-called prosperity of the banking business does not refer to its own development, but is caused by the lack of outlets for funds. Those who benefited from financial adjustments were not merchants, rural areas, or general enterprises, but the banks themselves. To ensure their own safety, banks were often unwilling to lend more to general entrepreneurs. At the same time, those entrepreneurs who could stand firm, because of the reduced scope of their businesses, did not need loans. As for the fledgling industries that were weathering the storm, they were in need of funds, but the banks were unwilling to release them. As a result of this stalemate, finance often stretched and contracted in a state of relaxation. The call loan situation in Shanghai in recent years and recently is a clear proof:</p>
<p>Monthly Average Call Loan Interest Rate Table (Unit: Fen)</p>
<p>January      February     March        April        May</p>
<p>Year 20         13           1            2            2            4</p>
<p>Year 21         13           35           19           13           6</p>
<p>Year 22         2            1            4            4            5</p>

<p>The reason why the period between January and February was relatively higher was because it coincided with the Lunar New Year, and according to old customs, the use of silver dollars in the market was relatively more frequent. Therefore, to statistically analyze this year's business situation, January or February should actually be included in the previous year.</p>
<p>Excluding January, this year's call loan market situation has the lowest average, except for the 20th year. Opening the market situation statistics, we can see that the call loan interest rate is in a stable state, with very few sudden rises or sudden drops. In addition to summarizing the old tune of "economic recession," we can also use the conclusion of evaluating the prices of general commodities: supply is high, and demand is low. First, let's talk about the supply side.</p>
<p>Because Shanghai is an international trading port, those in the interior who want to purchase goods must bring funds to Shanghai. Also, because of its special organization, general wealthy merchants and gentry come to Shanghai to avoid the dangers of their hometowns. These two factors are the simplest reasons for the increase in the source of funds. Below is a statistic on the flow of cash.</p>

<p>The cash mentioned in the table above includes cash, silver dollars, and large bars. According to this table, there is a common point, that is, in Shanghai, the inflow and outflow of cash from and to the domestic market is often in a surplus position, while the opposite is true for foreign countries. If we compare the amount of cash flowing in from the domestic market with the amount of cash flowing out to foreign countries, the former often exceeds the latter. Therefore, Shanghai's reserves are relatively increased. However, this table cannot, of course, be regarded as a completely accurate statistic, because private exports are not included.</p>
<p>Another opposite trend is that the inflow of cash from the domestic market to Shanghai has an increasing trend, while the outflow from Shanghai to foreign countries has a decreasing trend. Regarding the former, we can see the signs of economic decline in the interior in recent years. In normal times, the trade situation between Shanghai and the interior is that Shanghai sends industrial products to the interior, while the interior sends agricultural products and semi-finished products to Shanghai. Therefore, the balance of payments will not be too far apart. Once the rural areas decline, there is no source for production, but consumption cannot be reduced too much. Therefore, the gap between the two sides' income and expenditure becomes wider and wider. In order to make up for this gap, the interior has to transport cash to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Also, because of the economic decline in the interior and the weak purchasing power, the import side of international trade has also weakened at the same time. However, a trade deficit is still a trade deficit, so the amount of cash exported to foreign countries has to be reduced.</p>
<p>A corresponding confirmation is to check the situation of international trade. In recent years, international trade, whether import or export, has been gradually decreasing. The decrease in imports has become a cause of the sluggish use of silver. In normal times, the interior would bring cash to Shanghai, and Shanghai would use cash to transport goods to foreign countries. Now, the cash coming from the interior is increasing, but the outlet is decreasing, thus forming a stagnant situation. Below is a comparison of the international trade situation.</p>

<p>According to this situation, the supply side is large, but the outlet, whether foreign countries have no need, and domestic production circles are dispirited and lifeless. In the past, the most active season for finance in Jiangzhe financial sector was the silkworm season, but in recent years, the so-called national industry of silkworm reeling has shown a distinctly bleak situation, especially this year. In 1930, someone statistically calculated that there were 105 silk factories in Shanghai, with 25,066 silk reeling machines, while this year there are only 33 factories, with 7,510 silk reeling machines, accounting for only three-tenths of the 1930 figure. Even in terms of prices, the highest price for improved breed superior cocoons is no more than 35 yuan, and the lowest is no more than 20 yuan. Compared with the recent last year's market price of 44 yuan at the highest and 25 yuan at the lowest, it is obvious how the silk industry is struggling in distress.</p>
<p>Secondly, the relatively developed textile and silk weaving industries also show signs of decline.</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems that the financial situation is an excess of floating capital, a state of stagnation, but it is not. In the declining production sector, there is actually a need for financial assistance, but it is useless. Because of the decline in the production sector, the financial industry does not dare to lend recklessly for safety reasons; the production sector further reduces its scope because it cannot obtain turnover from the financial sector. This situation is harmful to both.</p>
<p>The excessively low call loan interest rate is not a matter of concern, because low interest rates can reduce the costs of all production sectors. However, under today's circumstances, the depressed state of the call loan interest rate shows the powerlessness, fatigue, and lack of vitality of the production sector, which is not only a fatal injury to the financial industry, but also a pessimistic phenomenon for the production sector.</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Alarming Decline in Shanghai Raw Silk Exports <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Wenqin</p>
<p>The sluggishness of Shanghai's raw silk exports began in the late autumn of 1931. Since then, there have been no large orders. Although there have been sporadic transactions, they are all filled with spot goods, and the price is reduced for competitive sales. The market situation has therefore declined, and manufacturers are crying out in misery. Later, the government provided relief by issuing public bonds, which allowed for a slight recovery. In the spring of 1932, the Japanese invaded Shanghai, and war broke out, causing the silk market to stagnate for three months. There were some transactions in the summer, mostly to sell off inventories at a reduced price, with market prices between 550 and 650 taels per dan. However, it did not last long, and fatigue reappeared, with vitality declining day by day. In the spring of 1933, the government encouraged exports, subsidizing factory-reeled silk by 100 taels per dan, paid in public bonds, which ended at the end of May. Exports saw a slight improvement. However, the essential panic of the silk industry remained as before. Except for the upper-level manufacturers and speculators who enjoyed this benefit, the vast majority did not get a piece of the pie. In the summer of that year, affected by the US recovery policy, market prices rose, with sales prices ranging from over 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan (raw silk prices also abolished taels and adopted the yuan), and many transactions were made, gradually showing a glimmer of hope. However, it did not last long, and it returned to its former state. Not only were transactions scarce, but prices also became cheaper day by day. Ordinary goods had fallen to 570 or 580 yuan by the end of the year, a huge difference of one-third. Most of our country's manufacturers have weak capital, leading to flight and escape, and there are many instances of this. Before the new cocoons came on the market this spring, the price was around 500 yuan. Unexpectedly, since the new goods entered the market, there have been no transactions, and prices have also been weakening day by day. Recently, the market situation for ordinary, coarse silk is only worth 420 or 430 yuan, and the scarcity of transactions is a new record unseen since the export of raw silk in our country. Because June, July, and August have always been the peak months for exports, but this year it is quiet and leisurely, which is beyond expectations. It is estimated that from June 1 to August 15 of this year, only 983 bales of white factory-reeled silk were shipped to Europe and 903 bales to the Americas. During the same period last year, 3,258 bales were shipped to Europe and 5,570 bales to the Americas. The most pitiful yellow factory-reeled silk has only 10 bales shipped to Europe so far. During the same period last year, 1,691 bales were shipped to Europe and 1,585 bales to the Americas. In total, since June of this year, only 4,419 bales of various raw silk have been exported, compared to 15,557 bales during the same period last year. This is a reduction of about two-thirds. According to this calculation, the output of white factory-reeled silk this year will be within 10,000 bales. I don't know how our silk industry will handle the aftermath. Moreover, the Sichuan silk in yellow factory-reeled silk is encountering particularly difficult circumstances. Not only is there still a large amount of inventory, but new silk is also being produced continuously, and its situation is several times more difficult than that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The export quantities of various raw silk in Shanghai in the past ten years are listed below.</p>

<p>Shanghai's raw silk exports have always occupied an important position in foreign trade and are closely related to the national economy. Before the first half of 1931, although there were ups and downs in exports over the years, it was still possible to maintain its inherent position. Moreover, in terms of selling price, ordinary goods were all above 900 taels or 1,000 taels. From 1928 to 1930, it was the golden age of the industry. All parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang also competed to set up silk factories at that time. The silver and money industry welcomed loans for silkworm cocoons because they were short-term and easy to sell, unlike the sluggishness of other industries. Who would have known that today's silkworm cocoons would fall into a slump to this point? Looking back on the past, one cannot help but feel emotional. Fortunately, domestic silk factories have recently adopted factory-reeled silk, which can sell about 30,000 dans per year. The domestic silk factories have also made a great contribution to the silk factory industry being able to survive until now. The causes and consequences of its failure are classified below, so that readers may gain additional reference beyond idealization.</p>
<p>(1) White Factory Silk - My country's factory silk has been famous in Europe and America for many years. Since Japan saw it and became envious, it engaged in research and development, constantly improving it, and sent a large number of experts to visit silk-using countries, with the purpose of catering to the psychology of buyers. After returning, they engaged in mass production to meet the needs of the world. Since the United States adopted uniform inspection, Japanese silk gradually rose to prominence. After experts invented new cost-saving equipment, the effect was remarkable. Since 1931, they have also used exchange rate dumping, and exports have greatly increased. The Shanghai-US market was defeated. Japanese silk began dumping in Europe during the Shanghai war. Europe has always disliked Japanese silk, but it used various propaganda and provided its high-end products for people to try, which was then bewitching. After several experiments, it was found that the quality was indeed good, the cut ends were less, and it was very suitable for use, and the price was particularly low. The raw silk of China and Italy was greatly affected. Today, Japanese silk has entered the inner sanctum in Europe. The reasons for the failure of Shanghai factory silk are nothing more than the following points: (A) Too many leaders, that is, gathering 120,000 capital, and those without experience and knowledge become managers, making rough and shoddy products based on personal will, without knowing how to communicate with each other, research and improve, and the market situation rises and falls, leaving it to fate. (B) High-end products must wait for huge debts before they are willing to sell them, without considering the trend of the world market. (C) The products are uneven, and there are too many brands. Each brand cannot supply a large amount of goods, and each batch of products is different. (This point is related to the declining quality of raw materials. There have been successes in improving silkworm rearing, which should be improved.) (D) The Italian-style silk reeling machines from decades ago have not been changed, which is very uneconomical for modern production and consumption. (E) Exporters are overly critical, and use improper means to sell the goods, resulting in total failure. In short, the declining quality of Chinese silk and the high price are the main reasons.</p>
<p>In order to recover lost ground, the silk industry and the silkworm industry must work together to be effective. (A) If a certain factory in Wuxi has achieved success, there should be at least a dozen or so organizations of the same type, and it is best to jointly set up a research department for improvement, so that it can keep pace with Japan. However, this organization is very expensive. In the first few years, or in the event of a world economic panic, it cannot make a profit. It must be maintained by the government or given various conveniences, so that those in charge can do their best to succeed. (B) Establish higher silk-making schools to train management talent for silk factories. (C) Train foreign trade personnel in raw silk for direct export. (D) The goods reeled by each factory must be submitted to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for strict inspection, classification, and certification to facilitate transactions. Those who fail the inspection are only allowed to be sold domestically and are absolutely not allowed to be exported.</p>
<p>(2) Yellow Factory Silk - My country's yellow factory silk has always been mainly sold to Europe, with few exports to the United States. Since it has been subjected to competition and low-price dumping by Japan and Italy, we have failed. Its advantages and disadvantages are roughly the same as those of white factory silk. However, the Sichuan yellow silk has a huge output, and the risk is also the greatest.</p>
<p>(3) Qi Li Silk - Qi Li silk entered the road of decline ten years ago. The Xunzhen merchants are ignorant of the world situation, and its market in Europe and the United States has been occupied by rayon, so there are not many exports. As for India and Africa, it will also decrease in the future, mainly because India's tariffs have increased, and the coarse silk of Guangdong is very suitable for local needs, and the price is also low. Therefore, Guangdong silk exports to India and other places will be prosperous. At present, Japanese lower-grade products are also being test-marketed, but the results are average.</p>
<p>(4) Yellow Silk and Yellow Tu Silk - This silk is unique to my country and is sold to backward countries such as India and Africa. In recent years, affected by the world economic recession and India's tariffs, exports have greatly decreased. If the rulers of these imperialist countries introduce scientific knowledge and gradually advance the natives, this type of goods will undoubtedly fall into decline.</p>
<p>(5) Gray Silk (i.e. Pressed Silkworm Silk) - This is a special product of the Northeast. It has always relied mainly on US sales. France and Italy in Europe do not purchase much and still use it, but the large customer, the United States, has switched to using rayon instead. Since the September 18th Incident, most of these goods have been shipped to Japan. The Japanese use it to interweave with raw silk due to its low price to make silk fabrics, which are transported to Europe, Australia, and Nanyang, in very large quantities. Therefore, the exports in Shanghai are only one-tenth of what they were at their peak. If the Northeast is not recovered one day, there is no need to talk about it.</p>
<p>Officials and civilians in our country, seeing this silk industry crisis, talk about relief every day. Various facilities do not focus on reality, but make empty words. The silk industry itself has no practical benefits. And the silk industry groups only know to ask the government to issue public bonds to save their temporary thoughts, and have no plans or fighting spirit for their own future. I dare to say loudly that China's silk industry needs urgent scientific relief. Those who preside over it should be upright, honest, and possess deep silk knowledge, and be rich in world market experience in order to be competent. If you only engage in propaganda and do not act, the future of my country's silk industry will not know to what extent it will be corrupted.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to report that Japanese mulberry fields are gradually tending to be converted into cotton fields. The experiment has been successful, and investment is currently being made in planting. Agricultural experts have also invented a method of converting silkworm cocoons into rayon wool, which will reduce the import of Australian wool by 140 million yen per year in the future. In other words, the Japanese are also looking for various outlets for their silk industry. I hope that people in our country will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>Call Loan Rate Returns to Seven Percent... Silver Coins Fluctuate in Value</p>
<p>Since the export of silver cash, the foreign market was once tense, but the situation only eased the day before yesterday. The foreign exchange market call loan rate was three percent lower than the day before, returning to seven percent, thus returning to its former state. Call loan transactions: more than 3.4 million in morning session transfers and new transactions, more than 300,000 in afternoon session transactions, more than 500,000 in small general association transactions, and only more than 1 million in foreign mortgage transactions for redemption and new transactions. Bank collection and delivery were completely halted due to Sunday. Only money houses had more than 37 million in foreign public bill collections and deliveries and more than 600,000 in remittances from various sources. The auxiliary currency market conditions fluctuated. Jiangnan small silver coins were difficult to exchange, suddenly falling four yuan, calculated at 833 yuan in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Guangdong small silver coin transactions were still considered good, opening half a yuan higher in the morning session, at 839 yuan.

<p>Loose and Excessive Chips Form Short Squeeze</p>
<p>Falling from One Yuan to Three or Four Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was in the final week of August futures. Due to poor conditions and loose and excessive chips, a short squeeze formed, which was only seen in recent months. Previously, the upcoming implementation of the bank savings regulations was seen as a positive sign according to common theory, and the market was crowded with bulls. However, due to the outflow of cash, high foreign call loan rates, tight credit, and banks hedging, most did not swap, coupled with rampant rumors and the Russo-Japanese situation showing signs of war, the bulls were greatly hit. Those who exited the market did so, and those who swapped did so. The market price trend was downward, differing from the highest price by a minimum of four or five yuan and a maximum of eight or nine yuan. The trend has not yet formally rebounded. A rebound is inevitable and must wait for credit to loosen before the market price naturally rises. Currently, it is only a temporary setback. The current situation has brewed into a situation where retail investors are stronger than large investors, so the future still has great fluctuations. Last week's experience: Monday was the busiest trading day, with more than 42 million in two sessions, setting a new record for the highest number of transactions. The market price plummeted due to the exit of large bull investors, falling sharply by six or seven jiao to as much as two yuan and eight or nine jiao. On Tuesday, purchases of No. 4 and No. 41 were very active, and there were also reports of new hedging transactions. The outflow of cash has attracted the attention of the government and the financial community, and there should be countermeasures to stop it soon. The market price suddenly rebounded, rising half a yuan to two yuan. On Wednesday, there was considerable competition between bulls and bears. The market price rose and fell sharply, rising one yuan in the first session, falling one yuan or even 1.6 yuan in the second session, and rising one yuan in the third session, fluctuating uncertainly, making it unpredictable. The result was slightly better. Thursday was stable, and transactions also decreased, slightly better by three or four jiao. On Friday, some bulls still exited the market, turning to a decline of several jiao to 1.5 or 6 yuan. Saturday was extremely chaotic, mostly in a short squeeze, continuing to a small decline of two or three jiao to eight or nine jiao. The market price for the week resulted in a decline of one yuan and several jiao to about 3.5 yuan. The trend thereafter should not lead to a major decline in the short term. Even if the financial community does not hedge, it will not have any impact. The total transaction volume is 17,409,500 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>-Opening at 13 Yuan 3 Jiao-</p>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were only 13 or 14 (with a total of more than 2,000 shi of goods), but most of them were late rice, and a few were thick indica rice. The sales market was still sluggish. Due to the drought, people's hearts were high. If the price of thick indica rice and late rice increased by 2 or 3 jiao, Duyangjian would rise by 1 jiao. As for Yinbian Yuan, the market was completely devoid of goods. As for new indica rice, in addition to the increasing amount of Changdong new rice by 3 jiao, Zhuanqiao new indica rice also started to be sold on the market today, with three loads arriving, about 200 shi. Because the goods were pure, the price was the same as that of Dongxin, opening at 12 yuan 3 jiao to 2.5 jiao.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than ten sources from various routes in Hexia. The various goods on the market, such as Quwei white indica rice, were flat, early thin rice slightly liquified, Baiyuan and various sharp varieties continued to be traded. The market situation was that white indica rice and thin rice were stable, early rice and Baiyuan were tight, and various sharp varieties were slightly tight. Dongxin indica rice was scarce and sold well, and the price trend was graceful.</p>

<p>Since the sluggish sales of Huisi iron from foreign gangs, the market has been depressed. In recent days, the factory's sales market has suddenly moved, and the standard, under the influence of the sharp increase in foreign pricing, has also moved upward. For example, old steel factory goods are estimated at 30 yuan per box, new steel factory goods are estimated at 29 yuan, and Yeji goods are opened at 28 yuan and 5 jiao, all of which have risen by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. However, local factories in this port have all dumped futures and spot goods. It is said that 2,600 to 2,700 boxes have been reached in two days. Foreign gangs such as Qingdao, Tianjin, and Fujian gangs have also added a lot of supplies.</p>

<p>— Wen</p>
<p>This year, the birth of the late teacher Confucius will be more lively than any Christmas in the past ten years or so. In this country where everything is believed in fate, the fate of Confucius's spirit in heaven, its prosperity and decline, can only be sought in the cycle of the sexagenary cycle.</p>
<p>Originally, in China, a poor and simple cultural and academic field, Confucius had his immortal position. The bad thing is that the disciples of the sage for thousands of years only knew to use "Confucius said..." and so on as a stepping stone for the professional movement of bookworms, just like Christians "eating the Bible." More than 90% of Confucius's believers also "eat the Five Classics." Since the purpose is limited to "eating," naturally there is no discussion of criticism, creation, and promotion. Moreover, the ideological rule of successive "political sages" after Emperor Wu of Han and the "closed-door vehicle building" of scholars in the Han Dynasty and Neo-Confucianists in the Song Dynasty finally turned Confucius's thought into a "nameless swelling poison" that has been a mystery for thousands of years. This is certainly the misfortune of Confucius's spirit in heaven, but especially the bad luck of the literati and intellectuals of past generations. Because they have eaten "Confucius's rice" for thousands of years, but nineteen have never recognized Confucius from the lines of "Book of Songs" and "Confucius said."</p>
<p>The misfortune of Confucius's thought really started with the May Fourth New Culture Movement. Chen Duxiu, the old general who is regarded as "deeply sinful" by many people and is still facing official lawsuits, and Wu Yu, the old hero who "single-handedly attacked the Confucius shop," have made very profound criticisms of Confucius's thought. In all fairness, this cannot but be regarded as a major advancement in China's academic and ideological circles. Because there must be criticism before there can be progress, and some valuable parts of Confucius's philosophy and political thought can withstand criticism. However, that work of re-evaluating Confucius's thought was met with the frantic opposition of the guardians of the Tao. When opposition was ineffective, it was followed by rumors, and Chen Duxiu became the advocate of "licentiousness as the first of all virtues and filial piety as the first of all evils."</p>
<p>The "adversity comes to an end and prosperity begins" of Confucius's deity or the language of the Confucian Temple has really started in recent years. Two years ago, one or two people who were worried about the world and wanted to correct people's hearts and stop evil words wore formal attire or Zhongshan suits and used the music of the yellow bell and great lu and the sacrifice of the whole pig to worship Confucius. Then, the dikes of etiquette such as men and women swimming separately, banning "dating," and banning gaudy costumes also arose in response to the times. These works may have given some blows to the modern movement, and the lively drama of splashing corrosive liquid and "fascinating to death" was also convenient for some journalists.</p>
<p>However, the most solemn and regarded as a grand ceremony is naturally the Confucius worship movement in the style of 1934, almost with bells and drums ringing and the phoenixes reappearing. The Confucian birthday, which is a grand occasion for a while, is only something that I am not sensitive to, and I have some opinions to explain incidentally.</p>
<p>First, the respect for Confucius is definitely not in the form. Chinese people, from large politics to small friendships, all make use of "formalism." To respect Confucius and focus on what music to use, what rituals to perform, and guide unified rituals is nothing more than a manifestation of formalism. In fact, what Mr. Confucius in heaven needs is probably to focus on the criticism and review of his theories and thoughts, so as to obtain greater progress and development. Otherwise, the set of being posthumously named King Wenxuan and honored as the Great Accomplishment Supreme Sage has long been practiced by emperors of past dynasties, and now it should be. Only by extracting its immortal part and examining and selecting what is not applicable to the twentieth century can we strive for the rational existence of the Confucian way. I believe that Confucius, who is as intelligent and sensible as Confucius, if he knew after death, would definitely understand the truth of "Aufhebung."</p>
<p>Second, that whole set of "Confucius said" cannot be used as a political incantation. The so-called "literary light shoots at the Dipper" was originally a kind of mad ravings of ancient talented scholars and literati. In modern times, in the war crisis where every gap between countries is filled with the smell of gunpowder, what can "shoot" is definitely not "literary light" but cannons and machine guns. Respecting Confucius is only to show respect for the succession of academic culture and the enlightenment of future generations. If you rely on respecting Confucius as an incantation, you will inevitably suffer the most tragic failure. The reason is the simplest: "small regular script sheep hair" or "seven purple three sheep" are after all swept on paper and cannot be used as anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>Apart from the above two points, which I regard as a taboo of the Confucius worship movement, I sincerely raise my hands to approve of promoting the sacred way. "Great is Confucius"!</p>

<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Proudhon once said such a sentence: "Property is theft," this is a famous saying, no, it is the ultimate truth. Since the formation of the private property system to this day, the endless disputes in society, if we do not have some selfishness, probably everyone thinks it is related to property. In the current society where the private property system exists, natural property has supreme authority. Precisely because of this, students must calculate how to get promoted and make a fortune in the future, and officials must love to scrape people's fat and ointment. And so on, other industry, commerce and hundreds of industries, also invariably diligently seek profits. If we look at these with intuition, we will of course not discover its wrong points, and think that it is a reasonable behavior in life, and at most we will say "greed obscures the mind." In fact, it is greatly wrong, but it is a blatant act of theft. People only say that those who steal are thieves, but in fact, like the above-mentioned ordinary people, that is, all people in the current society, are not all possessing the heart of thieves? Those who are wealthy, which one is not a thief? If you see this point clearly, you will know more than half of the society.</p>
<p>Truth is not easy to find, because it is limited by time and space. In other words, it is indeed the truth at this time, but it will become non-truth at another time; it is the truth in this place, but it becomes non-truth in another place. For example, thirty years ago, the three obediences and four virtues of Chinese women, foot binding and hair accumulation were the truth, but today, not only is it not the truth, but it has suffered infinite contempt. Chinese people use burial for the dead is the truth, but the Japanese do not think so, and only cremation is considered the truth. There are countless such examples. I think only the sentence "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" and this kind of fact are the unchanging truth, no matter when or where, a man or a woman will always feel that his or her beloved lover is like a unique flower.</p>
<p>Sichuan's land tax has been pre-collected to the 68th year of the Republic of China, which is a good phenomenon, and I have no complaints. It's just that I am a little uneasy in my heart, because I wonder if this current Republic of China has such a "longevity"? If not, then I really don't know how this account will be calculated in the future?…</p>
<p>According to reports, more than 50 counties in Hunan Province reported disasters of "hopeless autumn harvest," and Zhejiang Province estimated that this year's autumn harvest would be at most 30%. I respectfully record the summary here for the reference of people living in the comfortable nest of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Record of Abstaining from Dancing <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Wandering in the metropolis, living a single life, what is the way to spend the lonely heart and the lonely days? So I sank into the ballroom. Using a lonely heart to squeeze into that not lonely place, although it will often make the feeling of loneliness even stronger. But hearing the light and lively music, and the fleshy women, the shadow of loneliness will temporarily leave my side, and drop my lonely soul.</p>
<p>After a long time, it becomes a kind of addiction, like being addicted to smoking. Whenever I feel bored and dull in the house, my legs will instinctively slide into these places. I can't even guess that if I don't go, I will feel empty and unfulfilled as if my soul has been pulled out. But when I go, I don't necessarily dance. Sometimes I order a cup of clear tea, sit half asleep, endlessly, until dawn, and run out without dancing a single dance.</p>
<p>In this way, I am suffering from severe evening sickness. Doing day as night and night as day, life completely loses its angle. Once night falls and the lights come on, my demonic thoughts follow and blossom, and I turn into a ghostly night wanderer in the style of a dipsomaniac.</p>
<p>But that kind of prosperous scene is always separated from me by a thick membrane. I have never had any deep interest. Crossing out of that green glass door, returning home alone, the lonely heart still returns to loneliness, and it has not diminished. And I am sinking more and more into melancholy.</p>
<p>But why do this? Life is worth cherishing. That kind of licentious life is simply equal to chronic suicide. You can't lightly ruin yourself like this! You must understand that those women all have a sweet mouth that specializes in lying, and every dimple is filled with the stench of copper rust. All the joy is built on top of gold. Moreover, these places are not places I can go at all. They are just labyrinths for people who are full and idle, with flesh shells but no feelings. I should be a person with feelings, but why should I mix with people who have no feelings?</p>
<p>So I began to feel sorry for the shamelessness of my life. There are many ways to pass the time, but I chose this decadent place. I must make up my mind to cut off this evil thought. Otherwise, I am a zero survivor. Therefore, in the future, when I stumble into the ballroom, I will add to the degree of disgust each time, and try my best to think from other aspects, so that the components of hatred and contempt are expanded as much as possible. Make my mood gradually separated from the object in front of me.</p>
<p>Regard all women as poisonous snakes, as ghosts covered with gorgeous colored clothes, wriggling in the dark lamplight, secretly sucking that essence. But people are all fascinated by that alluring smile and have not noticed the ugly and hideous face hidden inside the colored clothes.</p>
<p>And the more I look, the clearer I see, and I shiver with goosebumps all over my body, which scares me and moves me. Finally, I escape as if escaping for my life, turn my head back, and glance at the people left behind who are still happily sending themselves into the mud pit, which is really pitiful and laughable. On the one hand, I am happy to get rid of the bad environment, and all of a sudden I spit out the heavy depression trapped in my heart, and take another breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>From then on, I recognized it as a demon cave and never wanted to go again.</p>

<p>(Letter) To the esteemed editors of the local supplement: On the 20th of this month, I read the cartoon "Recruiting Advertisements" published in your magazine, signed by Shao Xiang, and was extremely surprised. My name is Chen Shao Xiang. The cartoon published in your magazine was not made by me. How could it be published under my name? If there is the same name, the style of the signature is also very similar. It is suspected that a shameless person is taking the opportunity to obtain manuscript fees, but the original draft is also copied. Readers will inevitably add blame to each other. This is both fraudulently signing the artist's name and unreasonably damaging my reputation. The crime is heinous. Therefore, I especially ask you to publish the original letter for correction in order to avoid misunderstanding, and hope to reveal the address of the submitter to the public. It is what I hope for.</p>
<p>I wish you good health, Chen Shao Xiang</p>

He had accepted his sister's tearful plea and intended to say a few words of support today, because she only had her brother to rely on. Although women are often unreasonable, there had been many precedents for winning such cases in Wujia Town. Today, so many well-dressed relatives were gathered, and nine out of ten were speaking for Fusheng, so she heavily relied on her brother to help. However, the brother was not the sister. Seeing the menacing approach of Old Master Wu, he couldn't bear to suffer this immediate disadvantage, so he secretly slipped out of the vicinity and went to mingle with his two young nephews.</p>
<p>Lord Fu raised his head, his eyes still with that fierce, predatory gaze. He had another debt in his heart that he hadn't mentioned! The expenses for Fusheng's wedding had been forcibly included in the accounts by Old Master Wu. So, he steeled himself and said:</p>
<p>"Uncle, I have always acted fairly. My sister-in-law is a young widow, and Fusheng is my own son. However… there were two years of famine, the wartime events, and then the expenses of seeking refuge in Shanghai. This time, Fusheng's marriage has put me in debt."</p>
<p>Old Master Wu seemed to get angry, lightly tapping the rosewood table with his palm. Lord Fu hurriedly lowered his head, not understanding what he had said wrong, or even what he had said.</p>
<p>"Fu Ming, our Wu family cannot do such dishonorable things," the Old Master said without any courtesy, "You are someone who cares about face. If I have to examine the account books of past years, everyone will lose face!"</p>
<p>"Uncle, don't be angry…" Lord Fu didn't finish his sentence before a maid came out from the inner hall and said that the Madam had asked the Lord to come inside, which made Lord Fu even more anxious. He took a few steps without moving his feet, and finally scurried inside like a fleeing rabbit.</p>
<p>The small group immediately began to discuss the matter noisily, drowning out the sound of the cicadas being brought in. Old Master Wu patted Fusheng's shoulder, "As long as I, Old Master Wu, am here, I will never let you suffer." Zhang Defu chuckled, feeling that his plan had not failed.</p>
<p>Zhu Quingui and his two young nephews had slipped away unnoticed. The hall was almost entirely filled with the Fusheng faction. Zhang Defu was naturally the most active member. The two aunts and the aunt-in-law had long been displeased with Lord Fu's fear of his wife. Today, they braved the hot weather to come and prepare for a battle of words. But seeing Old Master Wu taking the lead and completely seizing victory, everyone wore triumphant smiles.</p>
