<h3>西陲危機之延擴（一）　英</h3>
<p>丨從英人方面觀察丨</p>
<p>據近日中外電訊。關於帝國主義者企圖侵略我國西部領土之野心。似有日漸暴露之形勢。如英人之於新藏。法人之鼓只侵佔西沙。皆足以證明其企圖之所在。吾人於此。欲謀所以鞏固我西圖。不能不對於彼主進攻之策略。先有整個之認識。否則徒知班洪事件之緊急。而忘滇桂之危機。徒知新疆之重要。而遺川康之巨患。非所語於固邊實圉之根本政策也。兹先就英人方面一探究之。</p>
<p>目前英人對於我國西部領土之企圖。有三大事件。可以注意。一則爲新疆南部之獨立。二則爲藏人之不時内犯。三則爲爲滇緬國境之糾紛。是三者。分而視之。似各有特殊之性質。合而觀之。則不啻爲英人掠我土地之整個計劃。蓋英人之於我國西部國境。土壤相接。經阿富汗印度以至緬甸。早成一大包圍之局面。遜清中葉而後。數十年來。雄心逐漸發展。觀其一方面積極發展喀什米爾之交通。（印度之西北省。與新疆爲鄰。）他方面於西藏之南。沿不丹。尼泊爾。之印度邊地。密敷鐵道。更於緬甸镜内。沿白拉馬普屈拉河。築鐵路以達於我西康之邊境。自緬京仰光築路分二支綫。以啣接我滇省西部重要地帶。如騰衝滾弄。（現時一抵緬境之密支那一抵緬境之　戌）策劃所在。無非欲以交通之大動服。操縱我經濟之開發。視我新藏川滇爲彼之禁　。蓋其處心積慮。固非朝夕已也。</p>
<p>方今日本肆虐於東北。野心迄猶未已。不啻投英人以極猛烈之興奮劑焉。何則。夫英人之於新疆。向爲與帝俄角逐之中心地。今之形勢。尤足以使英人不能忘情於中亞細亞之雄圖。蓋欲爲保障我西陲之侵略政策計。勢所必然。此南疆之所以多故也。若夫西藏一隅。英英人始則收我屬地哲孟雄爲保護國。繼則大舉侵藏。而有光緒十六年之藏印條約。民國而還。屢次促使藏人犯。而已則以調人自居。主張以德格以西。劃歸後藏。年來康藏紛爭。時止時作。其必有人鼓動操縱於其間。顯然可見。報載月初犯康藏軍之飛機大砲。乃悉自英倫供給。是豈空穴來風。此今日康藏之所以多故也。至於滇緬邊界問題。由來已舊。過去如片馬問題。江心坡問題。旣以我前當局之可欺而啓其佔地之貪心。復以日本之不顧國際信義。肆意侵略。而益啓英人伺隙思動之念。乘滇緬未定界之間隙。爲實行掠地之嘗試。據日昨（本月二十四日）英方之表示。謂開鑛地點在班弄而非班紅。此爲顯然之飾詞。將來交涉。必甚困爲。此滇緬問題之所以糾紛也。</p>
<p>吾人觀察英人言面之企圖如此。然而我國西陲之危機。固不僅此而已也。</p>

<h3>日本貴族參加共産運動</h3>
<p>左傾思想的一個剖面　（日本通信）</p>
<p>官吏取締得最苛刻的一般下層社會所醉心的赤化、牠不特要赤化勞工社會、並且深入於一般貴族青年羣衆中、在勞工社會中的秘密、已經是一件尋常不足稀奇的平常事、在貴族中的赤化運動、却不能不說是奇聞、現在先來報告這奇聞罷、日本的學習院完全是一所貴族學校、與一般平民隔絕的另一社會、我們中國人除了前總統黎元洪、曾送過他的兒子進這個學習院之外、再不曾聽見有什麽人進去、由此可見、牠關防之嚴、與用意的週密、殊不知日本近來經濟不景氣的結果、表面上共産業曾有變相的發展、但與一般人民實際生活没有什麽大相干、都市的工人依然深受着生活的威脅、農村就更是因苦不堪了、因此刺激一般青年、特别是有作爲有志向的青年之青春狂熱、對現狀不滿、大有不可遏止之概、現在將這段奇聞中受着刺激、作出奇事的主要人物、分别寫在下面、</p>
<p>中溝三郎、是現任的男爵、去年春季在京都帝大畢業、因其學習院時代的學友八條隆孟關係加入共黨、是設立資金網運動中的活動分子、去年秋季被捕、冬季保留其起訴、現被宫内省宗秩寮審議會嚴加斥責、</p>
<p>森俊守、是現任東京市議長森俊成子爵的長子、他是設立資金網的指揮者、在華族子弟中非常活動、受他感化的、單就學習院裏面、卽不下四五址名、因此當局者對他要加處責、除由司法起訴之外、並嚴責其父、並削除其將來襲爵的權利、</p>
<p>上村邦之丞、是上村從義子爵的長男、受他姐姐的影響、加入極左運動、並與岩倉公爵的令妹靖子等組織突擊隊、去年被捕、現已釋放、現由宫内省宗秩會嚴行斥責、令其父看管、</p>
<p>龜井兹建、是東宫侍從龜井兹常伯爵的長子、他與八條·森·等在學習院中大張其赤色的資金網、據說是他和實際運動關係尙淺、所以去年秋後、經一度檢舉、卽行保留起訴、現亦由其他看管、由宗秩會嚴行斥責、呌他改悔、</p>
<p>久我通武、是久我通保男爵的弟弟、他在八條隆孟指導之下、組織突擊隊、也是爲資金活動的一分子、並在神出某咖啡店、參加過政治研究會、現在同受斥責處分、山中定男、是山口正男男爵的弟弟、去年春季在學習院畢業、在學校的時候、卽與森俊守等有密切的聯絡、作擴大資金網的運動、也是突擊隊員之一、正在活動的時候、卽被檢舉、不久保留起訴、現同受斥責處分、</p>
<p>此外還有小倉公宗等、也受同様處分、這是已經不能掩飾的分子、至於還有嫌疑較輕、或證據不足的、都暫置不論、日本的貴族子、弟爲什麽會有這許多人不斷的受赤化傳染、</p>
<p>原因並不是怎様複雜、第一、是現在那種貴族敎育與實際生活不符、不能滿足青年人的希望、第二·是日本實際社會生活的反響、大衆的窮乏化已撼動了全日本社會機構、所以他們抛棄其地位而參加赤化運動、這是日本重要問題、同時也値得我們祖國的人加以研究的事、（三月二十二日於東京）</p>

<h3>憲草平議　章淵若</h3>
<p>（一）　憲草法理</p>
<p>愚近篤信「自力救國」之義（註一）居恒以求已責已自動、雅不欲論人短長、夫宇寷眞理、各有其範、世界法學、宗派各殊、出主入奴、固爲學者所深忌、好同惡異、尤非政家之風度、况吾國承鼎革之餘、處新舊交替之會、而近世憲政之邦、其憲法之精神、因時代之推移、事實之證明、已有種種無可諱飾之缺陷、吾人起草之時、前無師承、近少模楷、旣不能有悖憲政之原理、尤未可盡從旣往之窠臼、繼往開來、懲前毖後、其事之艱、不言可喻、（註二）故吾人今日之論斷、實貴能左程右凖、斟酌損益、若僅各本偏見、吹求辯難、則非特不足以昭事理之眞諦、恐反有碍憲政之發展、此愚所謂「平議」之本旨也、</p>
<p>數日以來、瀏覽憲草、默察輿情、深覺吾人評論憲法、有一不可忽視之前犦、是卽憲法所據之法理、否則一切辯難爭執、不特盡屬詞費、抑且轉滋糾紛、</p>
<p>考各國憲法、均有其特殊之精神、一貫之法理、法國革命之精神、爲個人自由主義、爲對於君主專制政治之反抗、故其法理、一方面爲極端的天賦人權論、一方面爲國民主權論（註三）蘇俄革命之精神、爲極端的社會主義、爲對於法國革命後議會民主政治之反動、故一方面根本否認有所謂天賦人權、並有不勞動者不得食之規定、一方面、又厲行無産階級獨裁制度、故憲法上僅有階級的權利、對於一般人民之私權政權、並未有隻字加以保障（註四）德國革命後之韋瑪憲法、其其本精神、爲社會民主主義、故一方面保障人民之權利、然於社會的利益上、仍須受法律的限制、一方面承認民主的原則、同時復將傳統代議制度、加以革新、（註五）意大利法西斯蒂的法制、其所基的精神、爲一種國家的社會主義、故一方面反對極端個人的自由主義、以個人爲國家之工具、非社會最終之目的、國家乃一絕紙的主權者、國家之力量、高於一切、得支配一切、一方面又反對抹煞個人主義的共産主義、凡危害國家生命、國家進步之經濟活動、固均在嚴禁之例、然如在不妨害國家利益之範圍内、個人企業、非特不加禁止、且認爲發展國家生産最有力、最可貴之原動力、（註六）故各國憲法、類都爲一種革命的與歷史的産物、一方面代表一種時代的精神、一方面又有其社會的歷史的背景、（註七）固少少數制憲專家、所得閉戶杜撰、更非抄襲移植、謂能行之有效也、</p>
<p>吾人雖未欲挾傳統法家之成見、衡校今日之憲草、然憲草本身所基之法理、究竟如何、吾人實應加以最先之研究、誠如憲法草案初稿第一條所云、「中華民國爲三民主義共和國、」則其所應本之法理、殆已甚明確、無庸致疑、三民主義是否可爲吾國憲法之基本法理、時賢學者、頗多爭執、愚於拙著現代憲政論第三章（中國憲政之基本原則）已另有詳盡之論斷、兹姑不贅、惟吾人縱觀全部憲文、則又不能不令人懷疑其所據法理、實前後未能一貫、而多所矛盾、存個人主義與社會主義之矛盾、放任主義與干涉主義之矛盾、如第二章關於人民權利義務之規定、固顯見其有一種反個人主義反、自由主義、否認天賦人權之精神、然第五章關於國民大會之選舉、以及第七章中央政制各節之規定、則仍多摹擬各國傳統的代議政治之舊制、此外與總理遺教相抵觸者、又不一而足、至於前後不相銜接、甚至同一章節之中、於法理上亦不能相通者、亦在所不免、凡此諸端、兹不俱論、容待下文、再申論之、</p>
<p>（二）　總綱</p>
<p>（一）於總綱之前、以可冠一序言、列爲首篇、以示吾民族之特性、以及革命之精神、查戰後德國憲法、卽於第一篇前、冠以序言、文曰、一德意志國民團結其種族、一德一心、共期改造邦家、永存於自由正義之境、維持國内外之和平、促進社會之進化、爰制兹憲法、」蘇聯富法第一篇亦有一長篇宣言、宣稱其社會革命、以及世界革命之精神、聲勢浩蕩、尤具特色、吾國革命旣有其特殊之使命、而吾國民族固有的忠心、孝、仁、愛、信義、和平、之精神、尤爲任何現代國家所不及、且憲法本具有政治敎育之功能、則當此内憂外患、交相煎迫、國脈民命、危殆萬分之秋、此時吾國之憲法、實萬不能徒事因襲歐美之遺制、而應有極度嚴正的國民敎育的精神、以挽民志、而振民氣、確立國家富强之基礎、深植民族復興之新機、（註八）此愚所以主增首篇之旨也、</p>
<p>（二）憲草第一條規定、「中華民國爲三民主義共和國、」時論譁然、羣相責難、吾人於此、首應抛棄一切政治恩急的情感、同時亦不可以年來黨治之成績、遽爾抹煞主義之眞諦、三民主義之眞諦、與其謂爲一黨之主張、無寗認爲立國之三大原則、蓋民族、民權、民生三者、實係古今天下所共由之達道、而尤爲吾國亟待解决之三大問題中山行狂一人之遺敎、雖不免有所掛漏、（按中山先生在其主義的自序中、有匡補遺闕一語）然其所昭示之原則、平心而論、實堪稱斟酌損益、極合吾國之國情、故黨人、固不得以爲「專利」、民國、亦未可以其黨見而忽視民族之需要、吾旣言之、各國憲法、旣都爲一種革命的歷史的産物、而又有其社會的與歷史的背景、吾國革命之精神與使命、旣與世界任何國家之革命、有所不同、而中國民族之歷史與特性、亦不能與他國相提並論、則吾國今日之憲法、又何可盡事竊取他人之成法、且歐美憲政、旣有其無可諱飾之缺陷、蘇俄革命、又益見其變本而加厲（註九）則吾人又何必自棄其民族之自信力、必欲醉心於「舶來」憲章、而抄襲他人殘缺不全之條文乎、此愚離開一切黨派一關係、不挾絲毫政治的情感、而純從民族的憲法的立塲上、虛心公允之言也、尚望全國賢達、共同商討、尤盼國民黨人、能善體斯旨、努力加勉焉、</p>

<h3>川商反對增漲水脚渝商會調停訊</h3>
<p>運費每年分洪水平水枯水三期</p>
<p>另訂新辦法定下月一日起實行</p>
<p>上海外商輪船公司尙不甚滿意</p>
<p>新聲社云、川江各輪船公司實行同盟合作、增漲水脚後、旅滬重慶商帮、羣起反對、一律罷裝、今已經重慶市商會等調停、决定解决辦法、定四月一日實行、各同盟滬公司開會討論、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>罷裝之後</h3>
<p>江駛川江輪船公司英商怡和·太古·法商聚福·美商捷江·意商義華·國啓招商局·民營北三·民生·等、鑒於長江上游、水澕載重之輪、不能行駛、以致收入不敷開支、自於上月十一日起、上海·漢口·沙市·宜昌·等處、先後實行增漲水脚後、重慶各商帮、羣起反對、旅滬蘇貨帮等、均停辦貨物罷運、以致各輪每次開航、貨物大减、太古怡和等輪、均因無貨可裝、暫行停航、</p>
<h3>在渝開會</h3>
<p>重慶市商會主席温少和·會同重慶航業公會主席趙資生、於本月二十三日下午一時、在重慶召集各帮及輪船公司開會、計到疋紗帮代表陳華封·鄧子文·蘇貨帮代表費鴻州、民生輪船公司鄧花一、太古輪船公司盧星北、曁其他各帮各輪船公司代表、由温少和主席、首由各帮代表曁各輪船公司代表、陳述反對及增漲理由、經主席勸告後、當得各方同意、决定新辦法、</p>
<h3>解决辦法</h3>
<p>新辦法如下、由滬運渝貨物、每年分洪水·平水·枯水·三期、洪水爲五·六·七·八·等四個月、平水爲三·四·九·十·等四個月、枯水爲凖、餘類推、洪水時期每包八元、平水時期每包十二元、最枯水時期每包十六元、蘇貨以量箱計算、運費分甲乙兩種、每一方英尺、洪水時期、甲種五角、乙種二角八分、平水時期、甲種七角五分、乙種五角五分、枯水時期、甲種一元、乙種七角三分、紙貨五金乾菜等貨物、照棉紗推算、以公斤計算、</p>
<h3>定期實行</h3>

<h3>航商集議</h3>

<h3>航政會議討論收回内河航權辦法</h3>
<p>收回内河航權一事、已喧傳多年而終未能實現、遂致我國航業未能發展、兹當中英·中美·商約屆滿修改之際、滬上各航商、已向中央請願、要求在修約時、將已失内河航行權、實行收回、此次交部召開之航政會議、滬上出席代表中招商局總船主沈際雲君、亦曾列席、昨日返滬、記者卽往叩、詢其重要議案、當承沈君出示議案錄、見由各地航政局及辦事處所提之議案甚多、而最主要者、厥爲收回内河航權一事、當經大會提議討論、其辦法分爲下列五項、</p>
<h3>登記外輪</h3>
<p>洋商輪船在中國航行各地者、並不向我航政局及交通部登記註册、遂使洋商輪船、自由增添、漫無限制、今須先辦在華外商輪船之登記手續、庶幾可以限制其噸位、逐漸達到收回航權爲止、</p>
<h3>檢查丈量</h3>
<p>本國商輪、早經實施、而洋商輪船獨不就範、雖迭經交涉、迄無效果、此事關係我國主權、應請政府向各國交涉、務使在華外輪、一律受檢、</p>
<h3>船員檢定</h3>
<p>國輪船員檢定、上年交部已經實施、惟洋商輪中船員則否、故、故外籍船員之駕駛技術如何、亦莫能得知、兹須先辦洋商輪船中高級船員、由我檢定、不合格者、不許其濫充、以重航海安全、</p>
<h3>收回領港</h3>
<p>通商各口岸領港權、久爲外籍引水人所把持、如上海四十餘領港、中國人力爭之下、亦祇得兩人、天津九人、中國人甫爭得一人、頃又爲某國排擠而去、領港關係最重、戰時尤甚、應由中國將通商口岸領港權、一律收回、由國人充任、</p>
<h3>抽乘客稅</h3>

什麽實習？會相信這許多鬼話呢？前幾天就一點事没有嗎？　　那一天的事，想起來眞是上他的當，我這人怎麽這様笨？就輕易的答應他的要求呢？　　我這命苦的人啊！　　十六日　又兩天過去了，阿汪的影子也没有上門，好啦，我完全受了欺騙。人生的價値在那裏，這給我認識了生活的另一面，是猙獰的狡詐的惡相而已。　　十七日　我不悲觀，受欺騙實在是生活上有力的敎訓。洗刷過去纔是我現在生活的實質，這就是我生活史上値得大書特書的一頁了。珍珠簾聽鼓娘方紅寳歌賦用夢窗韻示鐵年葦佛公展  孤鸞　　　　壓愁麟帶楊絲嫋。尊前意，在絃柱流鶯偷道。舊曲換江南，信六朝歡渺。壁賭黃河何日事，有殘客旗亭還到。香峭。洗緗梅素靨，稱他嬌小。堪惜客裏光隂，任看雲刦盡，交車塵繞。未必是離染，惹紅襟凄抱。錦琴年華天様遠，仗夢中啼眉能笑。付秉燭消磨，斷腸春老。看相駡  兪友清　　相駡是打架的前奏曲，相駡到了不可解决的時候，那末不得不揮拳攘臂，大打出手了。北方人生成一副尋相駡面孔，開出口來，就是一聲媽特皮，令人聽了，有些毛骨悚然。　　寗波人生就一副尋相駡聲音，開出口來，也就是一聲馬東歇撇，令人聽了，多少覺得刺耳。所以合了兩句俗語：「情願和蘇州人相駡，不情原和寗波人講話。」本來蘇州人的說話，十分温柔，眞所謂吳語呢喃，像春燕一般的清脆，就是相駡，也落靜工的，一點没有浮囂烟火氣，所以同蘇州人相駡，比和寗波人講話，來得有味了。　　前天我的東鄰的三小姐，和西鄰的四小姐，本來是一對小姊姊，平常十分和好的，爲了三小姐聽了人家一句話，就向四小姐大興問罪之師，她們兩人正在那裏對口相駡，擁擠了一街的行人，都停步看相駡了。旁邊有一個隂陽怪氣的人，在那裏說道：「看相駡比看有聲電影還好看，發音清楚，動作敏捷，蘇州的女人，究竟是够得人家說是健而美了，健，就是健於相駡，美，就是動作美，聲調美。」這一番說話，我聽了十分够味，那個看相駡的人，究是一個幽默大家，這幽默的話，實在幽默到極點了。　　本來别人家相駡，你何必去破工夫看相駡，看相駡也没有樂趣，但是想到那個看相駡的人，發表的論調，使我也得着一些看相駡的趣味了。總說一句，看相駡也許是「幸災樂禍」的暗示吧！硯的研究（十）（一）  無聊客　　端硯概况　　（戊）冰紋凍　大西洞的冰紋，白暈縱横，有痕無迹，穹如珠網。輕若藕絲爲最上品，硯辨所謂所冰如雪，非烟非霧。乍視之祗見一片白氣者，卽大西洞亦不多得，其他若正洞東洞所出，白紋如銀線略粗而不渾融者，稱爲二層冰紋。則適損豪，都非所尙，近市估每以有黃氣之粗銀綫冐充冰紋混售，不可不愼。　　硯史之說大西洞以魚腦帶青花爲極品，次爲蕉白帶青花，又次爲天青帶青花，又次爲魚腦蕉白天青而無青花者，若冰紋帶青花，乃千百中之一二，可謂絕品，但據吾人所見，冰紋每爲蕉白地而兼帶青花者，唐世昌君近獲一冰紋硯，蕉白地也，余愛而攫爲己有矣。　　（己）火捺　火捺一名火黯，斜斑處如火燒狀者稱熨斗焦。端人不以爲病，惟有過於黑暗或堅研如鐵者，則名爲鐵捺不足取，其在蕉白魚腦之外，有細縷彎繞，若臨風飄揚無定者，爲馬尾紋火捺，（以有白絲紋爲最貴）或色淡而　，狀如五銖錢，四輪有鋩者，爲金錢火捺，更有一片紅暈，艶艷若明霞者，爲胭脂暈火捺，石有此類火捺。其石必壯，惟大西洞有之，故最可寳貴，蓋馬尾紋胭脂暈等，與火捺同屬一種美文，特爲火捺中之最佳者，乃日人强分爲三種，故除青花外，另分爲七種（魚腦·蕉白·天青·冰紋·馬尾紋·胭脂暈·火捺紋·）美文·誤也。東北四連長  張恨水　　第二十六回　慷慨剖胸襟忘家報國　凄凉對玉鏡嗟我懷人　　關耀武笑道：本來嗎，我這様的大個子，要自比賈寳玉，也未免太不自量了。可是我是實話，那個時候，我和你大嫂子暗下裏眞不壞。後來也是兩邊家庭瞧出苗頭來了，就把我們婚配了。一嫁過來，你猜怎麽着？頭一個月，就鬧了幾塲蹩扭。誰讓我是表兄呢，我就讓着他兩回。到了第二個月，我可忍耐不住，就和他吵了幾塲。從此以後，我們是常吵常鬧。以前呢，我們還不免在住家過日子小事上生些是非。到了後來，没有别的，總是爲了錢鬧意見。這幾年，我在營裏住着，心裏空空洞洞的。一回得家去，那就像進了枉死城一様。你說吧？我那一頭會想家。趙自强道：你這様子怕家，那麽，你們大嫂子在家裏；也會不會想你呢？關耀武道：他想我幹什麽？他想我的大洋錢！殷得仁向他丢了一個眼色道：老關，你怎麽說話，這様的不留神。這裏兩個人，一個是有了太太的，一個是有了愛人的，你若說女人都是想男子們大洋錢的，這豈不讓人家聽了怪確受的？田青笑道：我不多心。因爲我和女人還没有發生金錢的關係呢，他想我的大洋錢作什麽？趙自强道：他不是這様人，我不這様想……但是，我也不想家了。他說着這話，不免抬起頭來。當他這様抬頭的時候，正有一羣雁，由天空過去，咿啞咿啞呌着。關耀武望了雁道：口子外看見這東西，不容易。田青道：爲什麽不容易？聽說雁這様東西，就是由西比利亞，飛到南方去的，那不是正要由這兒經過嗎？趙自强閑閑在望着天上道：那麽，他也許經過北平嗎？（三四七）小園藝茶花  范烟橋　　春氣漸和，庭前山茶已爛變作花，此花最富麗堂皇，並呈莊嚴色相，供諸膽瓶，有若唐花，而種類之多，價値之貴，亦甚於他花。吳下拙政園舊有寳珠山茶，吳梅村作長歌詠之，今詩猶刻諸屏，而花早枯槁以死矣。少時至吳窗齋宅，於漢石經寳前見大紅山茶花，開逾百，號十八學土，今亦無曩昔大觀矣。　　山茶一名曼陀羅。羣芳譜云：「以葉類茶，又可作歌，故得茶名。」上句可信，下句未經嘗試，不知確否？又言有號鶴頂者，産自雲南。有號碼瑙者，産自温州。皆未曾見過。惟寳珠千葉攢簇，殷紅若丹，是爲斯中翅楚。余於里中數見之，皆小樹耳。至於其他巧立名目，半出於花工居奇，半出於文人好事，大抵聞名不如見面也。　　馮時可滇中茶花記云：「滇中茶花甲海内，種類七十有二，鄧直指作茶花百韵詩，言茶花有十德。一艷而不妖。二壽經三四百年，尙如新植。三枝幹高聳四五丈，大可合抱。四膚紋蒼間，黯若古雲氣罇罍。五枝條黝糾，狀若鏖尾龍形。六蟠根輪囷離奇，可憑而几，可藉而枕。七豐葉森沉如幄。八性耐霜雪，四時常青。九次第開放，歷二三月。十月養瓶中，十餘日顔色不變。雖不無溢美過譽，要亦可稱山茶知已。然山茶在江南，頗不耐寒，若不被以稻草，必至花凍不開。而移植更不易活，外家江城有銀紅兩本，高六七尺，花開滿樹。前年移至吳下新居，皆憔悴以終。而生長之難，甚於他樹，我家一山茶，歷五年，增不滿尺，或此花宜熱地，江南太冷耳。　　近人方臞輯滇南茶花小志，收羅甚博，以爲滇南茶花甲天下。余所見不廣，不知其言至今猶可信否？因時會變易，往往有昔稱當有，今已中落，如洛陽之牡丹者。每聞園丁有廣東大紅日本銀紅之稱，則茶花已不能爲一地所域矣。　　吳下新婚夫婦襟上綴花，必以山茶爲心，茉莉作圍，蓋亦所其不易　謝且猩紅吉利也。東坡詩：「從來佳茗似佳人」，雖此茶不是那茶，然山茶人面，相映而紅，亦推綴諸新嫁娘襟上，最相稱耳。談金花菜  鄭逸梅　　春蔬雖多，然以金花菜爲最鮮雋，予耆之甚於魚肉，滬人稱之爲草頭，實則苴蓿之一種也。史記大宛傳：馬嗜苴蓿，漢使取其實來，於是天子始種苴蓿。　　唐人時：明月何團團，照見先生盤，盤中何所有，苴蓿長闌干，蓋至唐始以金花菜充饌然人猶薄而鄙之也，厥後周忱撫吳，謁蔣給事性中，蔣以是菜爲欵，周啖之讚美不絕口。一經品評，而金花菜之聲價乃十倍，士大夫家相率視爲席上之珍。　　金花菜，一名盤歧頭。莖臥地，葉爲三小葉合成，小葉倒卵形，頂端凹入，花小色黃，其形似蝶，莢作螺旋形，有刺，隨地蔓生，俯摘卽是，村娃往往携筠籃，至野外採之。亦有下子而種於田畦者，然皮不及隨地蔓生者之具有眞味。禮失而求諸野，信然信然。　　鹽漬金花菜，可爲消閒食物。曰：鹹金花菜。以太倉所産者爲最有名。　　滬俗立夏日，以金花菜和粞中煎熟食之，名草頭攤粞，秦硯畦老人有詩詠之云：金花雅號是誰題，密葉叢叢剪不齊，留得黃花開幾朶，待逢立夏喫攤粞。　　煮金花菜，必須油多，將熟，置上好高粱酒少許，啖之自然罄逸。又金花菜妙肉絲，旣雋且腴，别有風味。</p>

<p>自由談大小騙  鄧當世　　「文壇」上的醜事，這兩年來眞也揭發不少了；剪貼瞎抄，販賣，假胃。不過不可究詰的事情還有，只因爲我們看慣了，不再留心牠。　　名人的題簽，雖然字不見得一定寫的好，但只在表示這書的作者或出版者認識名人，和内容並無關係，是算不得騙人的。可疑的是「校閱」。校閱的脚色，自然是名人，學者，敎授。然而這些先生們自己却並無關於這一門學問的著作。所以眞的校閱了没有是一個問題，即使眞的校閱了，那校閱是否眞的可靠又是一個問題。但再加校閱，給以批評的文章，我們却很少見。　　還有一種是「編輯。這編輯」者，也大抵是名人，因這名，就使讀者覺得那書的可靠。但這是也很可疑的。如果那書上有些序跋，我們還可以由那文，思想，斷定牠是否眞是亭人所編輯，但市所陳列的書，常有翻開便是目錄，呌你一點也摸不着頭腦的。這怎麽靠得住？至於大部的各門類的刊物的所謂「主編」，那是這位名人竟上至天空，下至地底，無不通曉了，「無爲而無不爲」，倒使我們無須再加以揣測。　　還有一種是「特約撰稿」。刊物初出，廣告上往往開列一大批特約撰稿的名人，有時還有凸版印出作者親筆的簽名，以顯示其眞實。這並不可疑。然而過了一年半載，可京漸有破綻了，許多所謂特約撰稿者的東西一個字也不見。是並没有約，還是約而不來呢，我們無從知道；但可見那些所謂親筆簽名，也許是從别處剪來，或者簡直是假造的了。要是從投稿上取下來的，爲什麽見簽名却不見稿呢。　　這些名人在賣着他們的「名」，不知道可是領着「乾薪」的？倘使領的，自然是同意的自賣，否則，可以說是被「盜賣」。「欺世盜名」者有之，盜賣名以欺包者又有之，世事也眞是五花八門。然而受損失的却只有讀者。馬賊  吳巖　　丨山中夜歌之一丨　　順着月光照出的山路，老董和小龍騎着渾身汗濕的馬，便路下坡去。谷裏瀰漫着青白色的夜霧，但一些黑森森的樹梢，却也聳現出來。足下看不見的地方，有山泉在小聲地潺湲着。艾草的香味，和泥土的濕氣，漸漸濃烈了。不遠處突然吠起犬聲，矮籬圍繞的茅屋，便在混著月光的霧中，裸露出了藍色的姿影。　　兩人在籬邊跳下馬，一隻馬色的惡犬，奔撲過來，大聲地吠着；但給老董駡了一句，便立卽停了，只是摇擺着尾巴　　「呵，狗都同你這麽熟識了，你還說不常來哩！」　　小龍一面鬆動着馬鞍子，一面望着他的夥伴有意思地笑着。老董並不答話，只是在摸索着捆在馬背上的口袋。小龍就掉開話頭，自言自語地說：　　「嗯，是柑子的花吧？（作聲地聳聳鼻管）怪香的！」　　隨卽掉頭四下望望，近處都是黑影參差的矮樹，遠處却横着淡淡的青白色的霧。　　老董提着滿裝東西的口袋，走到屋下去敲門，犬兒盤旋在他的足邊，用背朝他的腿子，親熱地擦着。敲了好一會，茅屋才明亮了一塊小小的窗洞，檸檬的燈光，射了出來，彷彿山中睡熟的龐大野獸，驀地醒了，睜開一隻眼睛似的。　　小龍看見門開了，同時喃喃怨恨的低音，也透了出來，那是屬於一個年青女人的。似乎在接着口袋之後，聲音就一下子轉柔和了，且爆出孩子一様的歡笑，然而到底在說些什麽，還是聽不清楚。老董並不進去，一會兒就轉身回來。女的才猛然大聲地發出抱怨的撒嬌的話：　　「深更半夜才來，來了又要走，眞討厭！……以後不准來了。」　　「不准來就不來！」　　老董大聲地嘩笑着。隨卽跳上馬背，向小龍點一點頭。　　「走吧，朋友！」　　小龍也跟着跳上自己的馬，一面笑道：　　「到同你不壞哩，只是……」　　「只是什麽？」　　老董馬上掉回頭問，様子做得很莊重的。　　「就是厲害一點兒。」　　小龍輕聲地笑着。他的夥伴不答話，只用兩腿把馬一夾，同時抽了一鞭，就飛速地朝樹蔭覆着的小道上馳去，瞬卽没入霧中。别處的犬聲，就在遠些地方連續吠了起來。小龍也連忙趕上前去，潤濕的夜風，拂着他的眉宇，間或有樹間的霧珠，濺在他的額上。前面霧裏摇曳着雄壯的歌聲：　　「說荒唐來就荒唐，不納稅也不完糧，碰着官兒，還要打他的耳光。」　　小龍的喉管，立刻癢了，便接口唱道：　　「呵呵，到處都是我們的天堂！呵呵，到處都是我們的家鄉！」　　在山坡上便追上了，同時起着兩人合唱的聲音。　　「聽呀，駝馬的鈴兒，我們的收穫呀，便在微明的早上。」　　呵呵，到處都是我們的天堂！呵呵，到處都是我們的家鄉！歸寧　湖北民謡  陸斐　　爸爷聽說女兒來，　　提起菜籃就上街；　　媽媽聽說女兒來，　　笑笑哈哈接出來；　　嫂嫂看見姑娘來，　　一壺熱茶提進去，　　一壺冷茶提出來。　　一碗魚，没除鱗；　　一碗肉，血淋淋；　　一碗莧菜没截根。　　哥說留妹家裏歇。　　嫂說床短被又窄，　　留下小姑那兒歇？　　哥說後頭園裏有草墊。　　嫂說草墊留着接東瓜。　　哥說東瓜結罷了。　　嫂說東瓜正開花回家  魏金枝　　回家家去，是因爲被一件事情感動了。　　當我的妹妹第一次寫信來，約我在年底一道回家去時，我没有答應她。我回答：「我不回去，我有我自己的事業，志向。」所謂事業和志向，那不過是一種好聽的名詞，實際上，我有一種痴心的留戀，一半也有着一種病，一種住下了便不想搬家等等的習慣，所以回絕了。　　第二次，她居然並不通知我，一直從上海跑到杭州來了。　　她雖然是我們最小的一個妹妹，然而也已經達到可以結婚的年齡了。不過，我總是以對孩子一般的態度看待她，和她談話，也常帶一種輕憐而微謔的神情。於是我開頭就說道：　　「小孩吓，小孩總是想家，想到家裏去吃點年貨吧。」　　這様說，一半是想挑撥起她早年便出外來工作的可憐的少年人的一種童心的歡樂，因爲我們在家時，是常以這種語調來取笑的。一半，便輕輕地掩蔽着我不想回去的意思。這就是些刺傷她的自尊心似的，她反辯道：　　「你道我還是小孩麽？我再也不爲一點吃的東西才回家去的。」　　「那麽爲什麽呢？」我問道。我不得不這様問下去。　　「我麽，我是回去看看爸爸和母親的。」　　「那是當然，你當然會說是回去看爸爸和母親，單說去吃東西是頗有些難爲情吓！」我還是頑皮地纏下去。（未完）絮語  瑕厂　　（十）（四）　　因談抒情隨筆，想到陸游的「老學菴筆記」卷一裏「去國二十七年」一則，又記起陳錫路（玉田）曾引此文於所著「黃嬭餘話」中。其言云：「放翁老學菴筆記，余去國二十七年復來，自周丞相子充一人外，皆無復舊人，雖吏胥亦無矣。惟賣卜洞微山人無恙，亦不甚老，話舊愴然。西湖小昭度僧了文，相别時未三十，意其尚存，因被命與奉常諸公，同檢視郊廟壇𡒌，過而訪之，亦已下世。弟子出遺像，乃一老僧，使今見其人，亦不復省識云云。其叙述存没之感，字字痛心，因思人生舊遊之地，不數十年，而知交零落，俛仰增悲，其約略似此者亦復何限哉？每披覽及之，輒作數日惡。」是可謂雙重抒情。從個人方面看，此種悲感，其被引起也，乃是必然；若從整個社會的進展言之，則此種情緒不會存在心中，可以斷言。所謂個人的情緒與社會的情緒，即在此等處，亦能同様見之。『春色惱人眠不得』北方民謡  雪友　　　　小巡警，　　一身青。　　什麽全不怕，　　單只怕大兵。　　見了洋車就發狠，　　見了汽車就立正。廣西的歌墟  韋永超　　歌墟是廣西的一種特殊習俗，也有人稱之爲風流墟。去其地的大都呌做「趁風流墟」。所謂墟，並非買賣貨物的市墟，乃是許多男女追逐，幽會的地方。　　廣西有九十四縣，以前各縣都有這種歌墟的風習。民國以後，此風乃漸衰；到了現在，殘留着這種風習的只有十九縣了。　　舉行歌墟的日期，各縣不同：有的在廢曆二三月間，有的在六月間，有的在八九月間，但以清明時節及九月間爲最盛。　　在從前，他的集會的地點是有一定的，大都是在村外的郊野或臨近山麓的地方。現在，因爲政府對於此事常施行有效的禁止，他們只好秘密地舉行，地點也没有一定了。舉行歌墟日期一到，男女青年便紛紛到他們臨時約定的地點，尋找他們的愛人。男子方面，爲防備意外起見，都携帶手槍或利刃。有時縣政府聞訊，飭警前往驅散，他們往往開槍抵抗，死傷是常有的事。　　他們爲什麽要舉行此種聚會？是不是因淫靡成風，索性約定一個集會時間，公開追逐呢？據他們的回答，這只是依照俗例，並非淫靡：必須要這様然後天災不降，豐年可保。　　他們在野外聚會的時候，並不是同野宴般的數十成羣，他們只是三五一組，女的頭上覆上一條白手巾，男的看見此種標記，便知是女性。男的標記却没有一定，有的拿洋傘，有的拿手杖，有的是吹口哨。當男女見面後，他或她便唱着山歌相謔，隨卽互問姓名，如兩方合意，那相慕的情歌便一首一首的你唱我和。男的對於女的所唱的歌須能隨口答和，否則女的便不睬他了。歌唱一番之後，如得着女的允許。男的便可把她邀在一邊，互談衷曲，贈她一些禮物丨丨化裝品，糕餅，生菓等。女的接受之後，常拿一條自己織的手巾答贈與男子。隨後他們便可抱吻或更加放浪了。這裏，我要說一說他們所共同遵守的規矩：凡一對男女在一處談心時，别的男子便不可再向他們的面前走過偷看丨丨除非是好朋友。當一對男女正在你唱我和時，别的男或女也不可向他們某一方挿唱。　　最有趣的是：在歌墟的那天，未嫁的少女如得到男子贈予的禮物，回家後，父母便引爲榮幸，嫁了的女子和在那天没有得到男子的禮物，她的丈夫也就不歡喜。原因是别的男子不愛上她，當在是因她生得不美了。　　歌墟會期過後，已嫁的女子仍舊規規矩矩的在夫家勤勞工作。她們把情人和丈夫分得清清楚楚的。遺書（七）  林徽音　　第二天她去向他說了她的滿意。可是二十五日她看到席卓雲差人又送了一封信來，說，他已去過出版部；他們說因爲已屆年關，經濟較緊，年内不再收稿，只好等到春天再說。雖然他費了很多的口舌，可是實在無法可想，只有請她原諒。　　「怎麽丨」不信任她自己似地，她把信再看了一遍，可是的確是那様的意思；她還把上兩天的那封信也翻了出來，她看她也没有把那意思弄錯。　　「這才怪！」　　可是她更急的是不知道發表費可也變動了没有。　　「怎麽對於這宗，他竟一個字都不提？」　　她便去看席卓雲，可是他不在他的辦公室。他的一個同事說那天他没有去過。離了那里，她便無所適從似地向席卓雲的家裏走着。　　「你去過我的辦公室嗎？」卓雲見了依娜，便頴悟似地問。　　「是的。」　　「你收到了我的信？」　　「收到了。」　　「實在没有辦法：我再三對他們說，他們總說在年内無論如何辦不到。」　　「你不是說他們已答應了的嗎？」　　「答是答應了的，每千字加出二元，可是大約因爲現在拿不出錢，就這様毁約了。」　　「現在不去談那個丨我要說，發表費呢，不會也有什麽變動吧？」　　「那要說起來看。」　　「說起來看？」　　「不說，怎麽能决定？」　　「到現在還没有决定？到現在還没有决定？你究竟在怎麽說？」　　「成是大概總成功的，可是說總要去說一說。」　　「向誰去說，你不是編輯嗎？」　　「可是錢並不是我管。」　　「你要去對誰說，到底？」　　「我要去看會計部有没有錢。」　　「要是没有呢？」　　「没有？兩百多塊錢大概總不會没有的。」　　依娜想問他，旣然要說，或者要看，他爲什麽不早些去。可是她又想問了有什麽用處？而且他不自會有他的理由？她便問了一個更實際的問題。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言都市社會與自殺事件  夢若　　近來上海自殺事件之流行，眞有點可怕；這是値得我們注意的現象。但不知怎的，這種悲慘的案情，雖然先後已發生了幾十起，而社會上却仍舊平靜無恙，連掀動一些微波都没有？這也許是因爲這等案件，在本地已屬司空見慣，不足稱奇，故未能引起人們的的以響？或者這類事實，是有些呌人不高興，比不上熱戀，幽會，捉姦等新聞之有趣味，所以很難够移轉人們的視聽？再或者說是這原因吧，因爲一般人處此内憂外患水深火烈的環境裏，大家都集中全力去應付國難，是以無暇顧及這種小事體？依我看來，最後一個揣測大歸未必是對的（雖則我希望牠能不錯），如果眞是這様，那都也很好了。第二條有幾分像是（雖則我希望其不說如此），理由無需說出，讀者也自能明白。第一項呢，想該是事實了；物以殺爲貴，自殺已成爲平凡的事了，誰耐煩去留心牠？可是社會某種案件的發生，直接間接對於整個社會的影響，非常重大。我們不能因爲自殺行爲太徧普了，就不願加以注意；正如我們不能因爲國恥事件之層出不窮，便不去關懷國事一様。尤其青年男女的自殺，更是値得我們去探究的。所以我主張對於近來風行的自殺案，言論界不可長守緘默，應熱切地加以一番討論才是。因爲牠是一個重要的社會問題，我們討論牠；並不是討論自殺者的個人問題，而是討論全社會的問題。　　本此信念，作者現在先來談一談要雪棠自殺案件。因爲這位青年的自殺，是我所認爲比較嚴重的一事；並且他又留給我們一封很老實地由衷心自白出來的遺書，與我們分折上許多方便，關於他的自殺事實，報上已叙述得很清楚，所以我們在這裏不必再費工夫去細說；我們只想很據他的遺書，加以研究一下。　　一個人的行爲，雖然自有其本身的意志作主使；但總逃不掉環境的支配。李雪棠的自然，是一個最明顯的例證。這位青年是怎様死的？這嗎？他的的確確是給這大上海都會的罪惡環境所誘惑，所壓迫，而走上最後之路的！遺書上不是說得很坦白嗎：「……到了這裏萬惡的海上，看看巍大的洋房，風電般的汽車，多麽羨人啊，祇要有錢，這算什麽，從此一切的虛榮，便映入我的腦筋，恨的時候，自己安慰自己，祇要有意想不到的財源滾進，這算什麽難啊，……金錢才是通靈琬物，能打倒一切者，我想惟有它了，何况尤其是愛情呢，呵，可怕啊，稱是欺騙多變峻崖般的惡環境，牢牢的縳着我，人生間的苦辣，總算也嘗了幾年了，……」看起來，他是爲了虛榮心，才實行自殺的。但這虛榮心，他却並不是本來便有的；是到上海而後，受物質環境所刺戟，才産生的。所以我說他是被惡劣社會所迫死，並非過言。　　誰都承認，都市是製造罪惡的淵源。牠會誘人作惡，爲非，犯法，而至於墮落，滅亡丨無量數青年，當未踏進大都會之先，性格是純潔的，良善的，行爲是正直的，規矩的；待至跳入都市，則好似墮落在萬丈的黑暗地獄，到處盡是陷阱，四面皆爲魑魅，被壓迫蠱惑之後，便一切都變壞了！李雪棠之爲惡社會所吞没，只不過是恒河沙數青年中的一份子而已；爲牠而犧牲者，正不知有多多少少呢！自來無數青年的自殺，雖原因很多；要不外就是爲環境所引誘，才起一種非分之想，而本身又因受經濟力所限制，終未能滿足其慾望，然後才萌厭世觀念的。不過有的人並没有，或者不願這麽明白訴說；而李雪棠是比較坦然地吐露出來吧了。其實李君的話，正足以代表一班已自殺或未自殺的青年的衷心之隱情。這誠是一件値得憂慮的事實！　　都市社會殺人，這是何等可怕呀！然而這又有什麽辦法呢！近代一切文物，盡集中在都市：各地方人，尤其想求學或想做事的青年，自不得不向都市社會跑；降至今日，農村又漸呈破敗之象，都市的人口吸收力更强。長皮以往，若都市環境不能改善，農村社會又無從建設，其禍害之烈，正不堪想象呢！　　李雪棠的自殺，有一事是値得特别留意的，就是他因受惡環境的誘迫，致發生一種妄求。他看到洋房，汽車，美人，便以爲這算什麽，祇要有錢，欲望就可滿足了。故他時時妄求有一種意想不到之財源滾進。何者是意想不到之財源呢？得航空劵首奬，中跑馬票頭號，都是。而詐欺盜刦亦可致之。故我以爲設李君而不死，又没有自覺意識，我担心他有一天必會挺而走險呢！　　此外，李君頗以貌美自負，而傷命薄，這是一種錯誤心理。他又很迷信運命，不思奮鬥振作。他自怨地說：「祇恨造物者蒼天，它把幸運的支配，給我太不公平些了」，這二點，也是他致死而無力自拔的一原因。然而我終不認以些責之！街頭活劇  子　　這倏平時已經是極偏僻冷靜的馬路，近幾日來浴在綿綿的風雨裏，更是顯得冷靜凄寒。　　但，在一個黃昏，雖然仍是一個凄風苦雨的黃昏，這條冷僻的路上忽然熱閙了起來，在一個十字路口密密層層地圍着一大堆人，這堆人人各人都現着一副不同的異常的嘴臉和表情，後面的拉長了頸子拚命在向前面推，自幸站在前面的又都牢據着自己的地盤，深怕給後面的人搶得了去，於是你推我擠，似乎是嚴重緊張的競爭下，這條冷靜凄寒的馬路，頓時就確沉没在騷動和熱閙的中了。　　「去，去看汽車壓死人哪！」一個顴骨聳起的黃臉孩子，扯着他的同伴，向這個人堆趕來。我的好奇心也頓時燃熾起來，當下就跟着這兩個孩子起朝人堆裏硬擠進去，被我們擠開的人們，都從他們的口裏輕微地哼出一聲「小鬼」來。　　人堆裏的景像呈現在我面前來了，正中停着一輛黑牌照會的大汽車，汽車前輪旁邊直挺挺地朝天躺着一個赤脚瘦小的年青小夥子，鮮紅的和血「嘓嘓」地從那兩個細弱的鼻孔裏不停地瀉出來，肚皮在一高一起很快的抽動着，兩顆烏黑的眼珠幾乎要突出到眶外，像是平時受了極大的委屈；一旦不可再抑地忿怒着似的，但是看上去，已是不有光彩了。血，鮮紅的血，經過面頰，耳際，流到潮濕爛泥的馬路上，流開去，和他身旁邊的一只籃裏流出的鷄蛋黃融合在一起來了，再加上烏黑的爛泥，就變成了烏赭的怪顔色而發着熱氣腥味的爛糊東西了。　　我望着這爛糊的怪東西，心裏亂鼓般地打着，呼吸也有些窒了；我不忍再看，把視綫移過來，移過那輛大汽車身上來，这是一輛嶄新光亮的大汽車，車廂裏坐着一對男女，那男的紳士模様！四十上下的年紀，稍微起了皺紋的臉上</p>

<p>出生了一把很濃的黑鬚，西裝，皮領大氅，噙着烟捲兒坐在彈簧墊上，鎭靜得像没事兒的；傍邊是一個妙齡的摩登女郎，像是受了很大的驚恐，把臉埋在雙手裏，身子斜躺在那個男人的懷裏。汽車夫坐在他們的前面，也像没事兒的，靜靜地讓巡捕來了，他才慢慢地把窗口的玻璃放下，伸出頭來，和巡捕先輕微地咕嚕了幾句，接着大聲說：　　「這該死的傢伙，我見他乘着脚踏車有前面自鳴得意的跑着，老遠我就掀喇叭招呼他了，他只當没聽見，並把車頭朝西一偏，搾着我的車輪，碰翻了。只這様輕輕的一碰，我碰死了，你看是不是該死？」　「别多說了！」那蓄鬍子的紳士嚴厲地吩咐他的車夫，很不耐煩地朝着巡捕說：「你把這東西打發人去埋了，汽車號子抄了去，明天我公館裏派人上行裏來交代便了。「接着在身上掏出皮篋來，揀了一張金邊卡片交給巡捕，巡捕接着卡片只略看了一看，就笑容可掬地答應了一個「是」。　　「開！」的命令從那紳士的口裏發出以後，車夫就按了一聲喇叭，衝開了人堆一直朝南飛去了，一聲聲喇叭，還從遠處傳過來，好像矜示着牠適才的勝利。　　看熱閙的人紛紛地在發表議論了，有的說「這孩子死得太寃了，汽車夫草菅人命眞可惡！」有的說，「這是刦數，這孩子命該如此。」有的還在讚慕有錢有勢的威風。然而也有在惡毒地咒駡着那乘汽車的人的祖宗的。　　還有一個白髮長鬚的老頭兒，牽着他的小孩兒，諄諄地囑咐說：「馬路上不能亂跑呀，坐汽車的闊老有的地錢，壓死了人他們是不抵命的；汽車夫靠着他主子的勢，也顯得格外威風，他要你讓他，不然他就壓死了你再說。所以我們手無寸鐵的人，見着他們，情願老遠就讓他們，免得吃眼前虧，根兒，你要牢牢記着我的話！」　　「你特殊的『人』，咱們是永遠該給你們壓死的奴隸嗎？看，看咱們和你總算帳的一日！」當這街道恢復了以前的冷靜凄寒，忽然從馬路的另一角落裏，發出了這様一聲尖銳，冷刺，凄絕的呌吼！打魚殺家  猛　　蕭恩有一個老朋友名呌李俊，因爲他很有膂力，人家又稱他爲混江龍。那天蕭恩剛送郭先生出去，便見李俊來訪：蕭恩連忙迎上前去喊「老朋友」；桂英也出來呌「伯伯」。　　郭先生回報了員外；說蕭恩魚稅凖明日加息送來。丁員外道；（「這是他想狡賴！不行！不行！」隨命打手黃三去强索。黃三領命前去，且說：「我就再不和那老鬼講情了！」俗語的新註解  文光　　（十）（一）黃連湯淘飯，苦到底。　　註：陶思瑾之被最高法院宣判無期徒刑。　　（十）（二）千里送鵝毛，禮輕情重。　　註：各國公使至南京國府遞呈國書。　　（十）（三）蜻蜓撞石柱，動也弗動。　　註：孫殿元攻打寗夏城。　　（十）（四）船頭上跑馬，走頭無路。　　註：劉桂堂之竄擾冀晋豫陜。　　（十）（五）六指頭搔癢，格外討好。　　註：旣派鄭孝胥等赴日謁覲，溥儀又要親自去朝見了。　　（十）（六）老太婆燒香，愛佛。　　註：黨國要人師事班禪。　　（十）（七）水蛇弗咬人，實形難看。　　註：孫傳芳皈依佛敎，身穿袈裟，兩手合十，嘴裏念着南無阿彌陀佛。（此事曾見於去年報上。）　　（十）（八）黃狼登在鷄棚上，弗偷鷄也是偷鷄。　　註：海派文人之於商業競賣。　　（十）（九）鄉下人看走馬燈，又來了。　　註：改革省制丨委員制變爲省長制。　　（二）（十）駝子跌一交，兩頭弗着實。　　註：德國民社黨旣不能併吞奥國，而又失歡於意國。　　（二）（十）（一）壽星唱曲子，老調。　　註：失意政客軍人下臺後，游歷歐美，考察甚麽甚麽。　　（二）（十）（二）張果老倒騎驢，不見畜牲面。　　註：去年十二月一日去看海京伯馬戲。（按海京伯馬戲班已於是日開往印度。）男同學  眉君　　我雖然倔張而較冷淡的不敢多近男性，而一向懷着孤潔自許的態度，然而男性確乎是有一種吸引的力量，他們在旁邊時，一方是感到有些難爲情，另一方可感到一種茫然的愉快似的情緒在振盪着，可是近來在這大學裏，我已相當嘗到了男性們的一種可怕，尤其所見的男同學，大半都是鬼鬼祟祟的様子，使人對于男女關係，感着失望，　　昨夜的月色迷離，朦朧，我滿腔惆悵的情意，纏綿的無可排遣，所以我悄悄的獨自倚着窗兒望月，引人無限感慨和懷想，眞是不盡的依依呵！但是我又怕給對面的男同學看到了，又要給他們用電筒來照的一種侮辱，所以我又偷偷的緩步下操塲去散悶，多麽幽美的月夜！我慢慢的徘徊着，眞有說不出的詩意，我正在低低的輕歌！而不幸的事又發生了，有三個男同學從校門外店子喫點心回來吧，不知怎様的靈敏，似乎發覺了有女生在操塲散步，鬼鬼祟祟的走近了來，漸來漸近，打破了我幽美的夢兒，我呆住了，俯首無聲無息的不知如何是好，他們走得太近了，我只好懶懶的走着，没有夢想到他不客氣的跟了來，我氣急了，但他們仍是如故的在後面緊追，我雖不敢回頭看但是他們的脚步聲令我聽得非常清楚，有節奏的和我的心的急跳相應和；而且，他們竟嘻嘻在微笑，我眞忍不住了，又不好就跑回去，表示給他們得意，一時眞難堪極了，無可如何的，只有想卽刻回去，我的眼有些酸了，又斷續的聽到：　　………寂寞得很呢………　　………良晨美景：一刻値千金………實在太孤單，太抑悶了……我更發火了，加緊了步伐，………自己一個人睡不着呢？………　　火上添油，再也忍不住，幾乎要滴淚了，一直走回來，到了宿舍門口，還微微聽到他們的笑聲，　　這也許是此生僅遇的事情了，我恨快的上樓回房，幾滴清淚拭去了，更感到極度的羞愧，憤恨，我眞絕對没有夢想到男同學會此馬路上的滬氓還無恥，也許這是現在一般的現象，但不幸我竟第一次遭受了如此的侮辱，總使我潔靜的心，受了大大的刺傷！　　一個傷痕的出口還近流着血，娘姨又拿一封信給我，我燒的心急得一跳，莫名其妙的拆開，匆促一看，我立刻憤恨的碎去了，害得同房的同學追問是什麽緣故，　　究竟是那一位先生，尊相如何，我都不管，單只這不通的情書，已令人嘔吐了，雖是匆匆一看而碎了，但我立刻已看出好幾句是不大清順，開首二句就是一個白字：　　慢慢的平靜下來後，我覺得眞如夢般，我的大學生活是如此可憐呵！　　四週的空氣簡直没有一些可以使我自由的呼吸了。正在悶悶沉思，娘姨還來補說一句，信是剛才小姐出去時送來的！！！業餘信箱親身經歷編者先生：　　生活在上海的人，尤其是青年，有一個當前的危機，就是易染花柳病。　　咎在病者抑屬社會，讓學者來歸納與演繹吧；我寫這封信的目的，只在於使一般人知所警惕，因而自愛而已。　　我現在已是一個親身經歷這種痛苦的過來人了，不幸中之幸，總算没有傳染着淋濁而只生了下疳，醫治了一月多後就斷了根。　　如果婚姻只像交友那様的簡單，安慰與性慾都可以得到正當的解决；可是事實上，婚姻是有代價的！結果，自信不是一位貪花好色的我，終於在受到長時刺激之後的又一個最兇的襲擊的晚上，感受性的誘惑，不克自持而喪失了我在上海六年的守身，以求煩悶之發洩。　　人事刺激爲陷我入苦海之主因，除了性的誘惑之外。從上面簡短的叙述中，可知一般青年，有淡通危機或痛苦三：　　（一）有代價之婚姻；　　（二）遲婚；　　（三）滬埠性交容易，易染花柳病。　　當我住在醫院裏療治的時候，曾先後與好多位花柳病者對話，對話中有時也各自訴說自己對於預防的方法；那時，我得到一個感想：人知花柳病之可怕，則對於傳染之源自有遠而避之的心理發生，喝知其可怕，而微曉有預防方法，那就冒險之心理生，丨敬告讀者，絕對的預防花柳病之方法，只有不去尋花問柳！　　在醫治之過程中，病人所受之痛苦，更難靠筆墨以神傳之！就我所受之經騐：　　（一）皮肉之痛苦　　（二）經濟拮据之痛苦　　（三）花柳病者罕得友誼般的安慰　　（四）怕秘密醫治之公開　　（五）感受失業之恐慌　　（六）續發症之恐慌　　（七）能否斷根之恐慌　　（八）飲食行動之不能自由　　上述這幾種痛苦，有些很易使病者掀起自殺之念，以求一死了之！　　更有不憚煩述者，人但知花柳病之可怕，而不知究屬怎様的可怕：可怕之眞相未明，則恐懼之心理必不過甚。經濟能力寛裕之讀者，殺能購閱關於講述性病一類的書，以求眞眞之了解，而免貽噬臍之悔爲幸！　　不通與不易看懂的地方，請編者先生斧正，俾得普及讀者。祝撰安！　　鍾谷仁敬上　　　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　　編者按：鍾君這封來信，情詞懇摯，編者讀了除感覺到一般青年「危機」之可怖，花柳病之危險外，對於鍾君這種以過來人之資格，向大家鄭重警告，暮鼓晨鐘，令人警醒這種態度，確値欽敬　　一般青年爲什麽要去蹈這種危險呢？不錯，是「性的誘惑」，是「人事刺激「。但是「這些陷人入苦海的原因」怎様拔去，鍾君却没有提出意見來的確，這是一個很難的課題，不論是誰，對於這個課題都不曾作過適當而有效的答案。但是，這個答案不論怎様難産生，是一定要它産生的；我們若不能研究出，則單以「危險」告人，恐怕仍不能使人不履危險。因此，編者除在明日公表的信後，試作一答案外，希望鐘君及讀者都提出意見來討論。　　這種「危機」，「咎在病者，抑在社會」不能單「讓學者去演繹」，這是我們一般青年自己的痛苦，自己應當去謀解决方案的。自我職業介紹　　楊君，江蘇籍，年十八歳，初中程度，現願任公司機關職員，或練習生，薪水不計，如合意者請投函西藏路九五弄四號似萍君轉。　　許君，無錫人，年十八歳，初中程度，願充任公司，商店，機關等練習生，薪水不計，合意者請函西藏路克倫醫院谷君轉。　　鈴女士，江蘇籍，師範畢業，曾任家庭及小學敎師有年，今願任家庭敎師或抄寫及其他等職，通訊處辣斐德路錢家塘道生里十九號三　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　楊女士，浙江人，中學畢業，曾任抄寫及家庭敎師，今願任抄寫或公司職員及家庭敎師等職，通訊處辣斐德路錢家塘道生里十九號三樓亭子間李君收。　　某女士，粤籍，年十八歳，中學畢業，能操純正滬語，現願就小學敎員家庭敎師機關職員商店店員等職，薪金不計，通訊處海寗路保安里三十一號新原小學舒女士收。　　龍翔君，三十一歳，江蘇籍，前在某著名蚊虫香廠供職，對於原料工程以及計劃監製皆有深切把握，如欲需此項人材者請投函浦東楊家渡惟善齋香棧趙玉甫君轉。　　某君，浙江籍，年二十五歳，能操國語，畢業於工業學校，曾任鐵廠及電器廠職員，今願就工廠管理或繪圖等職，欲聘者請函東熙華德路九百二十二弄第十二號羅君轉。　　某君，江蘇籍，大學畢業，曾任中等學校敎員多年，現願任銀行公司及機關職員，如需此項人才者請投函法租界環龍路四百八十四號許君轉。　　某君，上海人，大學畢業，對於勞工問題素有研究，現願任勞工管理職務，月薪五十元，通訊處塘山路七八一弄十八號竹廬轉。　　某君，年二十八歳，敎會大學畢業，現急欲某一安定之所，如有公館欲聘家庭敎師可供膳宿者，薪金面議，卽請賜函蒲柏路大益公寓十八號孫斌君轉。小說熱的風（四）  蔡彤華　　天還没亮，阿興醒過來，母親已燒着早飯，忙碌着把一束的亂草朝灶裏送，生着通紅的火舌的灶肚裏，發出「虎虎」的聲響。火光照在母親古銅色的瘦削的臉上，那深深劃下的縐紋，越顯得憔悴。那脫了外層而露出了狼狽的泥草的墻壁也格外的頽舊了。憔悴，頽舊，像鉛塊般緊緊地壓迫着阿興，雖然自己是怎様的勤苦，債只是天天增多，食纒却年不如年的减少，不要說母親的希望丨積蓄着娶妻育子丨要歸消没，就目前的情况，又接不上新的，接不上，到什麽地方借去？這年頭。還有償還一半的代價，向地主們借去嗎？推討着的田捐呢？一切一切，洶湧着聚隴着來，他嘆着氣。　　呻吟似的嘆氣聲，驚動了年老的母親，她慈祥而傷感的眼光，像安慰和憐恤的望着睜了眼看住屋頂出神的阿興，「天還早，睡多一刻兒。」　　「媽！林大爺的錢還没有借到嗎？」　　「不會借不到的，我們又不會短他一分一厘，昨天我已對陳大媽說，央她在太太面前先說一聲，陳大媽又得太太喜歡，說話比我們還有力。想不到，陳大媽竟有這様的好老運，她的兒子阿牛，聽說還是林大爺招呼他哩！每月都寄批回來，不是八塊便是十個，定下的親，年尾便要聚過來。唉！個人個命。老太婆帶着羨慕，有氣没力的。　　「媽！昨天那個壞雜種，不是說今天一定要錢嗎？」提到錢，阿興的妹妹記起母親昨天答應推捐的話，他帶着稚氣的揉着眼，小雀兒一様跳着的持着水桶到院子裏汲水去。　　「什麽？」阿興問：　　「呵！什麽ＸＸ捐，每丁要抽四毫子，連老鬼都要收，我告許他，老頭十幾年都没有消息，怕已變成骨灰，誰有許多閒錢，但他們死也不肯，我們家裏一文錢也没有，說了多少好話，才答應今天來收。唉！錢，錢，什麽都要錢！老太

<p>電影專刊英美影片的戰爭　至「凱塞琳女皇」而益烈  奚冷　　英美影片戰爭，自從「亨利八世」開始的。去年十月中，英亞力山大柯爾達（AlexanderＫorda）的鉅製”The　Private　of　Henry　VIII“（華譯「英宫艷史」）在美國公映了，並且被美國的影界鉅子，推爲一九三三年世界十大片之一，於是美國影片在世界上的霸權英國製片家，已漸露其問鼎之意了。但是到了「凱寨琳女皇」，這是個影片戰爭，遂有蓬勃不可遏止之勢。這個叙述俄國女沙皇塞琳事跡的歷史鉅片（Catherine　the　Great）本來有兩張。一張是英國影片公司製的，就呌“Catherine　the　Great”，是英國歷劇天才女演員伊麗莎伯勃格納（Elizabeth　Bergner）和小范朋克合演的。一張是美國派拉蒙公司出品。它因爲要區别於英國片子，拍製在美片之先，就另起了一個“The　Scarlet　Empress”（紅色女皇）的名稱，是由德國女明星瑪琳第德麗許（Marlene　Dietrich）主演的。英國製的「凱寨琳女皇早已告竣，於二月十四日在紐約公映，地點是亞斯德戲院，當時美國各界名人，都被柬邀參加，頗極一時之盛云。　　這張「凱塞琳女皇」雖是在倫敦拍製的，但却委任了美國的聯藝公司（United　Artists　Corporation）作他們的經理商人並且决定了用百老滙的一家大戲院，作初次公映的塲所。這様就使美國的影界全體哄然了。並且這在美國影史上，亦是破題兒第一遭，一張英國片子能够在紐約賣座賣到兩元，頂先定座，一天放映兩次的。這非但可見美國聯藝公司的當局，已經明白承認，英國片子像「凱塞琳女皇」的，已是和好萊塢最優美的産品處於同等的地位，並且它的座價，已是和百老匯的標凖舞臺劇的座價相頡頑了。因此，美國的影界未免有些起了恐惶，因爲這確是英國的第一張片子，在美國的市塲上，搜括了百萬元的收穫，綑載而去了，在這經濟原狀未恢復之前，百萬的金錢，確實係可以使人眼紅的。　　這亦是一九三四年的事，要是在一年以前。義要說英國片子會這様地侵入美國市塲，而取得了勝利以云，他一定會被人人認爲瘋人的。但現在這許多空想，却已都成了事實，可見英國的影業，在過去十二個月當中，已有長足的進展。這是足使美國向來自驕自大生影業鉅子，發生疑慮　了。當「英宫艷史」在美國公映之後，美國一般人士尙以爲此不過英國偶爾的佳作，不足爲英國影片增永久的光榮，但是「凱塞琳女皇」接踵而來，並且勝利蓋過了前片，於是美國的製作家，都不得不默默深思了。　　好萊塢的影片界鉅子，最初受了驚駭的，就是高爾温（Ｓamual　Goidwyn）和沈克（JosehpＭ.Schenck）。高爾温是米高梅公司的主人翁，他看見了「英宫艷史」和「凱塞林女皇」之後，就發出一種嚴重的警告。他說：「除非好萊塢立時驚醒起來，將他們的製作方針，根本改革一下專從質的方面着力，而不在量的豐富，恐怕好萊塢在全世界影片製徐上的權威，要受重大的打擊了。在影片製作方面，無論在地理上講或是其他，本年是無所謂專利或霸權的；現在英國的製作，已有這様的發展，這就是一個明證」。高爾温的話，當然是一個權威者之言，不可忽視的。還有沈克，他是聯藝的總理，他新近從英國調查了英國影業的情形，回到美國。他到美國後第一句簡單而富有恐怖性的話，是：「英國人來了」！但他却又說英國人的襲擊，美國人不可當作可怕的事，而應當認爲係一服興奮劑，「我們惟有以運動家的態度接受之，而努力以圖抵抗」云。觀衆意見談談「舞宫春夢」  丁玎　　無可諱方的，這是一張摹仿戀愛至上主義的美國影片之一。它是以「舞女」以「大學生」作爲題材，而以他們的戀愛，發展故事的。　　這裏有兩點値得我們注意的：　　（一）現實社會是多麽矛盾啊！牠一方面造成了種種原因，使其種環境下的女性，不得已丨丨沉醉於這種逸樂生活的當然例外：至於號稱爲女作家而做舞女，是否「不得已」却是疑問。丨丨而操舞女職業；而他一方面，當她一旦陷於這種生活以後，社會馬上又取消了她的「人」的地位，從此她永遠是個祇値「四毛錢一摟」的舞女，受人奚落，以至於脫離了苦海以後。我們對於編劇者同情於舞女的痛苦，也表示相當的同意；可是對於劇中以追求闊少，以達到重新做人的人目的，就算是舞女的出路，却不得不認爲這是編劇者意識的歪曲。　　（二）我們再看：本劇中危機的造成是發端於「至少三百塊錢一月」的醫藥費，爲了這筆醫藥費，曼曼才會重作馮婦，才會發生最後的不幸。所以「舞宫春夢」中更告訴我們，在都市中，没錢的人最好不要生病，否則，「一月至少三百塊錢」的醫藥費，至少會把你嚇壞的。　　　出方面，未免太便我們失望了，舞塲的簡陋，舞女丨丨除曼曼以外丨丨服裝的不稱，把容易討好一般觀衆的塲面，尤可惜的忽略了。演員中除范雪朋從改變作風的論點上說，比較使人滿意外，飾蔡曉峰的余光簡直完全失敗，連幾個最簡單的動作丨丨如走路，咳嗽，丨丨和表情丨丨和接得學校開除信後的悲憤，被老父察破與舞女同居時的恐慌，丨丨都不會做。本來這是一齣悲劇，但是爲了主角的表演力的薄弱「悲」始終没有悲出來。　　至於導演，小技巧雖也有些，可是許多地方太使人莫名其妙了。校役傳信後的一笑，蔡父的以淚絕子，舞塲經理出人意外的袒護舞女，和蔡曉峰毫無疑慮的輕信報載。「舞宫春夢」雜評  爾音　　主演范雪朋的表情不很深刻，有時還失之過火，但最後在牢監裏的注視和苦笑是可嘉的。那時我覺得她有點像阮玲玉。她實在是很有希望的。也很美麗的。　　余光在這片裏的表演，不能使人滿意，尤其是咳嗽，太做作了。有一位看者說：「這種咳嗽，一千個當中不會有一個。」　　魏鵬飛也不過爾爾。但也許得歸咎於導演。父子重圓一節，觀衆的心理，以爲將有一種比較動人的表現，然而結果是没有。脫離時也不能完全切合。　　說起來要算馬東武飾馮經理好些。「旖旎風光」中之一幕丨南京映。病室前的焦急等都不差。　　以劇情論根本上也似有未妥之處。蔡曉峰旣知曼曼是在做舞女，應該可以想到三百塊錢的來處因而加以諒解。至於爭風吃醋，更是不合事實的。他本來没有情敵，何至當卽疑心她而，不加以些少同情呢？　　又，蔡曉峰的病也好得太快，也生得太出人意外的厲害。病時，亦無病容。　　蔡的表妹好似是他的侯補愛人，不管怎様終在守着他，而劇中又無怎様的交代，大約劇作者的意思，凡是表妹都是表兄的愛人；不，都是愛表兄的人。　　此外，全劇没有代舞女出一點主意，没有代舞女找一個出路，僅僅作一點微弱的悲觀的同情，殊無意思。　　至於父子關係以及開除學籍，都是天一公司的老法子，好像没辦法改換另一種似的。　　總之，這張片子不是爲了舞女，又非爲了誰，不知究竟爲了什麽？　　我個人以爲可取的只是丨丨一絲幽怨深深地埋在她心頭，將永遠無人知道，無人諒解。這是稍能引人同情的。「人猿泰山」要和「野猫」散塲了  福　　「人猿泰山」主角莊南威斯穆勒（Johung　Werssmuller）和著名墨西哥野猫盧潑范麗絲（Lupe　Velez），去年結婚不久，但是雖在已告脫輻了。他們雖然事後經過調解而復合，但是這一次的裂痕，恐怕是始終難以平復的了，特别是關於這般美國電影明星的事。有人說：這許多男女明星結合的時候，要是肯多用些腦筋（思想，）少用些心（愛情，）他們一定會生活滿足些。像威斯穆勒和范麗絲這兩個人，本來就不應就結合的，因爲一個是揮發性的，爆烈性的（范麗絲，）一個是遲鈍的，不易興奮的，性質完全不同的。他們的結合，完全一時好奇心，和盲目戀愛的衝動，多半還是發動於范麗絲的愛慕這位「人猿泰山」健美雄偉的體格的原因，所以很難以持久的。從這種離離合合上面，我們亦可以知道一般人的理論：「雨極相過必自相拆消而得其均和一的說法，在人的性情上是不通的，因爲人的性質到底不像電力或磁力那様單純也。樂園游藝會近訊　　本市法租界金神父路，愛麥虞限路，中華學藝社之樂園遊藝會，定三月三十一日，及四月一日，舉行遊藝。内容有電影明星胡麗女士歌舞，無名劇人話劇公演，曁其他魔術，音樂，電影，滑稽等。每日兩塲，票價僅售小洋兩角，四角。四馬路現代書局，吕班路中外書店，及甘世東路微微商店，均有代表云。電影小說喀羅蘭那（Carolina）（五）  文印　　那天一天，威爾所思念不忘的，不是别人，而竟是那個伵戶之女瓊娜了。佛琴妮衣飾雖極講究，却是那報過於巴結討好的心理，太明顯了些，使他不得不轉想到那穿粗布衣服，天眞漫爛的村姑，康納萊家裏的人，儘管穿破舊衣服，但却都能我行我素，毫不介意。因此他和佛琴妮，在這衣着外表上面，已經覺得有些格格不相入了。再則佛琴妮是吸紙烟的，使他迴想到和瓊娜方才所說的話。或者女子現在却已經吸紙烟了丨時代已經變遷了丨除掉康納萊之外，一切都改變了………　　到了晚飯的時候，西皮奥很笨拙地侍候着，佛琴妮穿着更爲燁赫的衣服……威爾想她穿着那件衣服一定在感覺到不安哩。老羅伯呢，總是嘵嘵不休的談着話……他的腦筋已經差不多消散了……他端起酒杯來，向已往的康納萊祝福，他喊着飲曼特拉酒，但是曼特拉酒，在若干年以前，早就完了……現在用的，好像是廚房裏用的料酒。晚飯過後，威爾和佛琴妮在柔和的月光之下散着步。他心焉不在地聽着佛琴妮讚美的話，他心早已飛越到瓊娜的身邊。……里奴在那裏唱着歌丨他却憶念着瓊娜，不知道她是不是也在聽着。　　明天，因爲晚上要爲佛琴妮開一次跳舞會，大家都在忙碌着。威爾爲避免一切煩雜，和佛琴婫的求媚起見，特爲拿了一支槍，到樹林裏去打鳥去了。到了將近黃昏的時候，他才慢吞吞地回來。等到他走近了瓊娜住的房子的時候，他很驚奇地聽到了爭吵的聲音。他在遠處望着，祇見西皮奥和兩個黑婦，站在那裏，他們每人手裏拿了許多花。他知道那些都是瓊娜自己種的各式各様的鮮花，現在好像都被一羣的蝗蟲吃了去了。他聽見璧娜喊道：「你們做什麽偷我的花？」西皮奥很笨拙的聲音說道：「這是康納萊夫人的地，這是康納萊夫的花！你是個貧窮的白女人，住在這裏，因爲康納萊夫讓你你的。」瓊娜哭了，他氣急敗壞地喊道：「你敢和我講這種話？」威爾連忙走上前去。他板起了面孔向着那黑奴道：「西皮奥，你在這裏做什麽鬼東西？」西皮奥有些害怕地說道：「没有什麽威爾先生，没有，先生。康納萊」夫人呌我弄些花，爲今天晚上佛琴妮小姐跳舞會用的，所以我來問問瓊娜小姐，肯不肯給些花給我……」瓊娜嗚咽着說道：「我一點都不知道什麽跳舞會不跳舞會。」威爾就喝着西皮奥，呌他拿花放下，可是瓊娜說道：「威爾先生，請你讓他們拿去好了。如果康納萊夫人要的話……我想……他儘管先和我說一聲……當然康納萊夫人是最歡迎不過的……什麽花，我都願意的。」那些黑奴聽見了，就連忙抱了許多花飛奔而去了。（未完）</p>

<h3>British Troops Arrive in Tangshan</h3>
<p>Protecting Foreign Residences</p>
<p>Engineers Carry Self-Defense Pistols When Entering and Exiting</p>
<p>Behind the Mine Strike, a Certain Country is Manipulating Matters</p>
<p>Striking Workers' Actions Gradually Become Excessive</p>
<p>Rumor That Public Security Bureau Accepts Workers' Demands</p>
<h3>British and Belgian Consuls in Tianjin to Investigate</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Because a certain country is behind the strike at the Kailuan Tangshan mines, it is extremely difficult to resolve. Gu Zhen, assistant manager of the mine bureau, returned to Tianjin from Tangshan on the morning of the 27th to discuss solutions with the British general manager. A small squad of 50 British soldiers stationed in Qinhuangdao arrived in Tangshan on the 26th to protect foreign residences. Engineers fear that the workers will riot, and carry self-defense pistols when entering and exiting. Family members have been sent to Tianjin. A certain country is manipulating the Tangshan mine strike, intending to (1) create panic in eastern Luanzhou to achieve its ambitions, (2) cause Kailuan to stop operating and be taken over by its management, (3) squeeze out our shares and form a British-country joint venture company. On the morning of the 27th, the mine bureau sent Secretary Zhang Guanru to Tangshan to continue mediation with Tao Shanggou. The actions of the striking workers in Tangshan are gradually becoming excessive, and the chairman Zhao Dazhong calls himself a commander. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Consuls of the British and Belgian countries stationed in Tianjin, under the order of the Public Mission, will go to Tangshan to investigate the Kailuan mine strike and assist the mine authorities in resolving it. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The striking workers of Kailuan Tangshan issued two announcements on the 26th. The first, against workers returning to work, considered them to be destroying the mass movement.

<h3>The Expansion of the Western Frontier Crisis (I) British</h3>
<p>From the British Perspective</p>
<p>According to recent news from both domestic and foreign sources, the ambition of imperialists to invade our country's western territories seems to be increasingly exposed. Such as the British actions in the new Tibet, the French promotion of invading and occupying Xisha, all demonstrate the location of their intentions. Here, we seek to consolidate our West, and we must have a comprehensive understanding of their offensive strategy. Otherwise, if we only know the urgency of the Panhong incident, and forget the crises of Yunnan and Guangxi, if we only know the importance of Xinjiang, and forget the great disaster of Sichuan and Kangqu, then we are not talking about the fundamental policy of consolidating the borders. Now, let's first explore the British side.</p>
<p>Currently, the British ambitions towards our country's western territories can be seen in three major events: one is the independence of southern Xinjiang, the second is the frequent incursions of Tibetans, and the third is the border disputes between Yunnan and Myanmar. If viewed separately, these three seem to have their own unique characteristics, but viewed together, they are nothing less than the British's entire plan to plunder our land. The British and our country's western border adjoins, passing through Afghanistan, India, and Myanmar, already forming a large encirclement. After the mid-Qing Dynasty, their ambitions gradually developed over decades. On the one hand, they actively developed transportation in Kashmir (India's northwest province, which borders Xinjiang). On the other hand, in southern Tibet, along the Indian border of Bhutan and Nepal, they densely laid railways. Moreover, within Myanmar, along the Brahmaputra River, they built railways to reach the border of our western Kangqu. They built roads from Yangon, the capital of Myanmar, in two branches to connect with important areas in the western part of our Yunnan province, such as Tengchong and Gunlong. The planning is nothing more than to control our economic development through major transportation movements, viewing our Xinjiang, Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan as their forbidden area. Their deliberate intentions are not something that has happened overnight.</p>
<p>Now, Japan is rampant in the Northeast, and its ambitions have not yet ceased, which is no less than injecting the British with extremely strong stimulants. Why? For the British, Xinjiang has always been the center of rivalry with Imperial Russia. The current situation is even more likely to make the British unable to forget their ambitions in Central Asia. In order to protect their aggressive policy in our western border, it is inevitable. This is why southern Xinjiang has so many troubles. As for the corner of Tibet, the British initially turned our dependent state of Sikkim into a protectorate. Then, they launched a large-scale invasion of Tibet, resulting in the Tibetan-Indian Treaty of 1890. Since the founding of the Republic, they have repeatedly prompted the Tibetans to invade, while they have acted as mediators, advocating that areas west of Dege be划归后藏. In recent years, the Kangqu-Tibetan disputes have occurred from time to time. It is obvious that someone is inciting and manipulating them in the middle. News reports that the aircraft and cannons used by the Kangqu-Tibetan army at the beginning of the month were all supplied from the United Kingdom. How could this be groundless? This is why Kangqu-Tibet has so many troubles today. As for the Yunnan-Myanmar border issue, it has a long history. In the past, issues such as the Pianma issue and the Jiangxinpo issue have already aroused their greed for land due to the deception of our former authorities. Furthermore, Japan's disregard for international faith and wanton aggression has further aroused the British's desire to take advantage of the situation. Taking advantage of the gap in the undecided border between Yunnan and Myanmar, they are attempting to implement a land grab. According to the British statement yesterday (the 24th of this month), the mining site is in Panong, not Panhong. This is an obvious cover-up, and future negotiations will be very difficult. This is why the Yunnan-Myanmar issue is so entangled.</p>
<p>We observe the British ambitions as such, but the crisis on our country's western frontier is not limited to this.</p>
<h3>Hawaii Islands Reclassified as Federal</h3>

<p>To Be Discussed in Congress Shortly</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's newspaper reports, Congress will soon discuss an unexpected proposal. It is said that Congressman McCandless will soon submit a proposal to the House of Representatives to redefine the Hawaiian Islands as the 49th federal state of the United States, no longer referring to it as a US territory.

<h3>Japan Endeavors to Avoid Diplomatic Isolation</h3>
<p>Strengthening the Current Diplomatic Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It has been a year since the Japanese government notified its withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27th of last year. During this year, the Japanese government has strived to open up the international situation in accordance with the imperial edict, and since Foreign Minister Hirota took office, he has devoted himself to constructive diplomatic work. The major relationships between Japan and countries such as China, Britain, the United States, and Russia have seen considerable improvement, and the pessimistic matters that were initially worried about have gradually been resolved. Regarding the "Manchukuo" issue, the attitudes of various countries have gradually changed, and the preconditions for formal recognition, namely the economic cooperation, have become increasingly prevalent. This is quite beneficial to Japan's future diplomatic work. If the current compromise policy proceeds smoothly, a sudden change in the international situation can be brought about after Japan formally withdraws from the League of Nations next March. In view of the diplomatic achievements of the past year, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to further strengthen its diplomatic work in the coming year, properly handle the international situation, and avoid falling into a state of isolation.

<h3>Army Minister Hayashi Instructs and Dismisses Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Deteriorating International Situation Shows No Sign of Abating</p>
<p>Ordering Them to Cope with the Military Spirit</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The first meeting of army commanders and division commanders convened by Army Minister Hayashi since taking office began at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th at the Ministry of the Army. First, the Army Minister delivered an instruction speech for about 40 minutes, and then the generals discussed matters under their jurisdiction in terms of administrative affairs. After a lunch break, a discussion meeting was held at the Army Minister's official residence in the afternoon. This discussion, with the Army Minister as the center, thoroughly discussed the issue of military involvement in politics, budget implementation, and other bureau-related problems that have become problematic. The main points of the Army Minister's instruction were as follows: Eternal peace in East Asia is Japan's traditional national policy. As for today's Japanese policy, it has gradually yielded practical results. However, the dangerous international situation caused by the Manchurian Incident has not yet shown any signs of abating. Looking back at the domestic situation, there is a need to renew material capabilities in every aspect. At this time, the only path we should take is to train the spirit of soldiers, rectify military discipline, and always maintain an inviolable attitude. We must abandon small differences and move towards common ground, and with a solid, iron-like unity, fulfill our original mission. (Nichi-Rengo Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>US Sends Silver Expert to Japan to Investigate Finance</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, it is rumored here that silver expert Mr. White will be sent by the US Department of Commerce to Tokyo to study the Japanese financial situation. This matter has not yet been officially announced, but it is heard that the government has a plan to add financial advisors stationed in various parts of the world, hence this move. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. McGowan, the director-general of Imperial Chemical Industries, recently traveled to the Far East and returned to England in January. He will give a speech at a meeting of Conservative members of the House of Commons in the future, saying that Japan's competition will become more intense today. If British and American industrialists take improper measures, Japanese merchants will be able to take advantage of the opportunity to profit. The Japanese have purchased the latest machinery, so in many industries, they have now advanced and surpassed the old industrial nations. He believes that the most promising remedy at present is for British and Japanese industrialists to contact each other. He has not seen any reason to hope that the situation in China will improve, but the Chinese market has great potential, because the Chinese have now decided to become industrialists themselves. He believes that British industrialists should encourage Chinese capital to be used in new industries, and said that the Chinese will necessarily demand to share in the benefits obtained in their own country in the future.

It will establish an investigative body as soon as possible to prepare for the implementation of the various laws passed by the Diet. Prime Minister Saito plans to visit Elder Prince Saionji in Okitsu in early April to report on the Diet's progress and the government's policies on the current situation, and to discuss the appointment of the Minister of Education.

<h3>Disarmament Plan Runs into Obstacles Britain Attempts Further Efforts</h3>
<p>Cabinet Studies French Reply</p>
<p>Special Emphasis on Safeguard Measures</p>
<p>Dispatching Letters to the German and Italian Governments</p>
<p>To Explore the Possibility of New Negotiations</p>
<p>(London) Although the US disarmament agreement plan has repeatedly encountered disappointment and resistance, the British government is still working to achieve this goal. The Cabinet Subcommittee on Disarmament Affairs discussed the general situation again today and finally decided that the US government should dispatch letters to the German and Italian governments to inquire whether progress is possible. At the same time, it was also decided to seek clarification of the French government's attitude through diplomatic means. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Committee on Disarmament Issues met this afternoon to study the French government's reply of March 17th (replying to the British memorandum of January 29th). After the meeting, it was said that when the cabinet members studied the French official document, they paid special attention to one point, namely, that the French reply seemed to divide the safeguard measures into two types: one was the guarantee for the implementation of the future disarmament convention, and the other was the general guarantee for security. The cabinet members paid great attention to this distinction in their minds. If the British interpretation is indeed in line with Paris's view, then the two governments will conduct talks through diplomatic procedures to explore the results that can be produced by new negotiation opportunities. The so-called new opportunity is to replace the principle of security guarantee with the principle of limited sanctions. People here are now newly in favor of the level of partial agreements. Most political figures believe that Germany's rearmament beyond the scope stipulated in the treaty will have various dangers. The method of partial agreements not only provides security for Western Europe, but also benefits Britain first. Once the current research work and ongoing talks are completed, and the conclusions are approved by the entire cabinet, the Cabinet Disarmament Committee will meet again to discuss it.

<h3>France Courts Belgium</h3>

<p>Brussels French Foreign Minister Barthou arrived here on Tuesday afternoon and will meet with Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans to discuss the major disarmament plan and exchange views with each other. It is deeply believed here that France will change its course on the issue of border defense forces, strengthen its northern border defense, or plan to advance the defense forces to the north to the mouth of the Meuse River on the Belgian border. The French and Belgian foreign ministers will meet until this afternoon, as French Foreign Minister Barthou is scheduled to return to Paris on Tuesday evening. (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Military Expansion National Defense Budget Increases Sharply</h3>

(The total annual budget is 6,400,000,000 marks.) (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>France's Diplomatic Strategy Towards the Little Entente Countries Shows Separation</h3>
<p>Czech Foreign Minister's Speech Caters to German Tastes</p>
<p>Conflicts Between France and Italy Will Become Increasingly Acute</p>
<p>| Comments from the Russian Newspaper |</p>
<p>(Moscow) "Pravda" commented on Benes's speech, saying, "This speech has aroused intense criticism, and in recent years, the criticism aroused by such speeches has rarely been so intense. At the same time, this speech has undoubtedly introduced new elements into the old and stubborn disputes of the imperialists dominating Southeast Europe." The newspaper continued, "The diplomats of the Little Entente countries are now openly expressing their alienation from French foreign policy. This fact is an initiative since the Great War. At the same time, Benes's remarks on the Austrian issue clearly want to cater to Germany's tastes in order to resist Italian conspiracies. However, Benes must take into account that an agreement with Germany can only go to a certain extent. Therefore, he suggested establishing a treaty to guarantee Austria's independence. In fact, Benes's speech not only failed to clear up the tense atmosphere, but also intensified the emotions of Benes, because this move indicated the separation of the Little Entente countries from France, promoted the contradictions between Italy and the Little Entente countries, failed to satisfy German fascism, and will inevitably make the conflicts between France and Italy more acute."

<h3>Communist Rumors Agitate People's Hearts the Safety of the United States is at Stake</h3>
<p>Congressmen Strongly Advocate Investigating the Source</p>
<p>Walter Prepares to Expose Secrets</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the saying that the President's "brain trust" figures are planning to overthrow the existing government system and replace it with communism has been greatly criticized and discussed in Congress. All congressmen have expressed their anger. Congressman Laney demanded that the Department of Justice promptly examine the issue in detail. Congressman Bourquin introduced a bill requiring Congress to examine it. Bourquin's proposal advocates appointing a committee organized by Laney to examine the truth or falsehood of Dr. Walter's accusations. The purpose of the committee is to investigate certain figures who, with a hypocritical attitude, are seeking to prolong the national depression, or are seeking to overthrow the government or the existing social system. (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The original text of the attackers is a letter, which has been sent by Mr. Lant, Chairman of the National Committee, to the House of Representatives. The letter was written by the famous educator Mr. Walter. The letter quoted the President's brain trust as saying that President Roosevelt's position in the future American revolution is only a "Trotsky" who is being used, and will eventually be ousted by a "Lenin". According to the opinion of congressional leaders, since Lant and Walter have considerable status in society, their remarks attacking the government should not be taken lightly. (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Gary, Indiana Walter announced today that if the survival of the nation depends on it, he is willing to publish the names of those who leaked from the brain trust of Roosevelt's government that America would be brought into Communism. The entirety of the letter to Dr. Lant, I will be responsible for. I knew that the day to disclose it was coming; I had been preparing. If the congressional commission investigates and requires my presence, I will be prepared to give a more detailed report. Walter continued, "If the life of this country depends on it, I will be able to reveal the traitors, and sooner or later I will die for it, but given how much the country is being harmed I dare not value my life. I will not conceal it!" (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<h3>The Attack Contains Retaliatory Effects</h3>
<p>(New York) Professor Key, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, made a statement regarding the attack on the brain trust by Dr. Walter, an inspector of academic affairs, saying, "If we know that Walter is a member of the National Inflation Movement Propaganda Committee, then his attitude can be understood. Because the brain trust opposes all inflation plans, Walter deliberately fabricated rumors as a retaliatory measure." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>US Congressman Proposes to Replace Old Banknotes with New Banknotes</h3>
<p>Arousing the Attention of the British Financial Community</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Connally stated today that he will soon recommend the recall of the currently circulating US banknotes and enact a law to abolish various old banknotes in two years. Many famous currency experts are currently drafting this bill to serve as the basis for Connally to submit it for discussion in this session of Congress. Connally's plan states that the government will issue new banknotes to replace old banknotes. The exchange of new and old banknotes will last for two years. After the expiration of the exchange period, all old banknotes will be subject to "time-decreasing discounts". This move is intended to stimulate the circulation of money, unearth the private hoards, and hope to find the criminals who kidnapped Captain Lindbergh's young son. The government has collected many kinds of banknotes, but it has never sent these banknotes to banks or other institutions for verification. The government's benefit in this matter is equal to the difference between the total amount of banknotes recovered and the total amount of banknotes payable by the Treasury and various banks, and the huge amount of banknotes that have been lost and destroyed is included in this difference. This news has aroused considerable attention from the British financial community. (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>New Precedent in Southern Ireland Diplomacy</h3>
<p>US Ambassador Presents Credentials to Eamon de Valera</p>
<p>Dublin The new US Ambassador to the Irish Free State, Mr. McDowell, will present his credentials to Mr. de Valera, the leader of the Executive Council of the Free State today. This is a new procedure in diplomacy, because according to the usual procedure, the credentials must be presented to the Governor-General. There are various speculations as to why the US Ambassador has changed the old practice, but the responsible party has not yet expressed its opinion. As for other etiquette, it will still be handled according to the old practice. Therefore, when the US Ambassador departs from the US Embassy, he will be escorted by cavalry to the public office. When presenting the credentials, a 15-gun salute will be fired. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Indian Nationalists Oppose the New Constitution</h3>
<p>Preparing for a General Strike and Demonstration on the Promulgation Date</p>
<p>Mumbai As the date of the promulgation of the new Indian constitution approaches, the various Indian ethnic groups are becoming more and more suspicious of the new constitution. The Sikh ethnic group has held a meeting and decided to organize a volunteer corps of 100,000 members to oppose the election procedures formulated by the British government, because this election procedure will place the Punjab State, where the Sikh ethnic group resides, completely under the rule of the Muslim ethnic group. The Trade Union Congress has passed a general strike to oppose the new constitution. It is also unknown whether railway workers will go on strike when the government announces the Parliamentary System Reform Act. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Economic Agreement Signed Russian-German Negotiations Completed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union on economic issues have been going on for a long time, and they have come to an end today. The treaty agreed upon by both parties has also been signed and established in the German Foreign Office. The most important part of this treaty is the various regulations for dealings with German banks in 1934, and a solution has also been found for the exchange rate of foreign currencies. Furthermore, the reason why this treaty has become necessary is that the total amount of trade between the two countries has decreased significantly in the past two or three years. For example, the value of German industrial products shipped to Russia in 1933 was only 28,200,000 marks, which was only half of the previous year. The goods imported by Germany from Russia also decreased from 27,100,000 marks in 1932 to 19,400,000 marks in 1933. Since Russia cannot currently borrow money from abroad, its imports must be offset by exports. Moreover, the trade balance between the two countries has always been in favor of Germany for several years, so it must be improved. (Kuo-Min Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>British-French Trade Dispute</h3>
<p>France Continues to Restrict Import Quotas</p>
<p>Arousing Extreme Indignation Among British Merchants</p>
<p>(London) The dispute over the trade agreement between Britain and France has become more urgent today. The reason is that France has reduced the import quota of copper, nickel, and other metals transported from Britain to France by 75% (i.e., reduced to a quarter of the previous total). This move has now aroused extreme indignation among British merchants. Furthermore, French Minister of Commerce Lemaire recently went to Britain with the aim of concluding an agreement with Britain to restore the previous import total. Now, he has reneged on his promise, which is even more unsatisfactory. When Mr. Lemaire left Britain, both parties agreed to temporarily maintain the status quo until after Easter. Now that France has suddenly taken this move, what the British side is questioning is whether this step by France is a diplomatic expression that France believes that continued negotiations are unnecessary.

<h3>Silingol League Schedules Special Meeting</h3>
<p>Plans to Request Amendment of Regulations for the Office of the Chief Administrator for Self-Government</p>
<p>Insiders Advocate Excluding Bureaucratic Forces in Personnel Selection</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain Mongolian official stated that the Silingol League has decided to convene a special meeting of the entire League at the Suo Wang Mansion on April 1st. Agenda item one: to suggest to the central government to request amending the Provisional Regulations for the Office of the Chief Administrator for Self-Government in Mongolian Localities. According to these regulations, the power granted to the Chief Administrator is excessive. If it is not properly handled due to personnel relations, it could hinder all matters of Inner Mongolian self-government. For example, Article 7 states that if the Chief Administrator deems the handling of affairs and the issuance of orders by the Mongolian Local Self-Government Political Affairs Committee inappropriate, they may correct or revoke them. If the Chief Administrator is close to the local government, then all Inner Mongolian affairs related to the local government will be difficult to proceed. Therefore, some people advocate requesting the central government to abolish the Chief Administrator, so that the Inner Mongolian Local Self-Government Political Affairs Committee directly reports to the Executive Yuan, avoiding multi-headed governance. Two: The issue of allocating personnel for the two departments, secretaries, counselors, and three sections within the Inner Mongolian Local Self-Government Political Affairs Committee, namely, civil affairs, industry, and education, and one committee, the financial committee. Prince De, Prince Suo, and Prince Yun all unanimously advocate absolutely excluding bureaucratic forces and employing young people as much as possible. (Special dispatch dated the 27th)</p>

<p>A Cross-Section of Leftist Thought (Japan News)</p>
<p>The radicalization that captivates the general lower strata of society, which is most harshly suppressed by officials, not only seeks to radicalize the laboring class but also penetrates the general ranks of aristocratic youths. Secrecy within the laboring class is commonplace and unremarkable, but radical movements within the aristocracy can only be described as extraordinary. Let us first report this remarkable event. The Gakushuin is exclusively a school for the aristocracy, a separate society from the general populace. Aside from former President Li Yuanhong, who sent his son there, we Chinese have not heard of anyone else entering the Gakushuin. From this, it is evident how strict its barriers and meticulous its intentions are. Little does one know that as a result of the recent economic downturn in Japan, communism has seen a disguised development on the surface, but it has little practical relevance to the lives of ordinary people. Urban workers continue to suffer from the threat of life, and the countryside is even more unbearable. As a result, it stimulates the youthful passion of general young people, especially those with ambition, and the dissatisfaction with the status quo is almost uncontrollable. Now, let us write down the main figures who are stimulated in this unusual event and perform strange things separately below:</p>
<p>Saburo Nakakoji, is the current Baron, graduated from Kyoto Imperial University last spring, and joined the Communist Party due to his friend from Gakushuin, Takatoshi Hachijo. He is an active member of the funding network movement. He was arrested last autumn, and his prosecution was reserved in winter. He is now being severely reprimanded by the Zochiku-ryo deliberation council of the Imperial Household Ministry.</p>
<p>Toshimori Mori, is the eldest son of Toshinari Mori, the current Viscount and Chairman of the Tokyo City Council. He is the commander of the funding network and is very active among the children of the aristocracy. Those who are influenced by him, just within Gakushuin, are no less than four or five people. Therefore, the authorities want to punish him. In addition to prosecution by the judiciary, his father will be severely reprimanded, and his right to inherit the peerage in the future will be revoked.</p>
<p>Kuninosuke Kamimura, is the eldest son of Viscount Kamimura Tomoyoshi. Influenced by his sister, he joined the far-left movement and organized a strike force with Princess Yasuko Iwakura, the younger sister of Duke Iwakura. He was arrested last year and has now been released. He is now being severely reprimanded by the Zochiku-ryo of the Imperial Household Ministry and ordered his father to supervise him.</p>
<p>Tsuneie Kamei, is the eldest son of Count Kamei Tsune, a chamberlain of the Crown Prince. He, along with Hachijo and Mori, widely established his red funding network in Gakushuin. It is said that his relationship with the actual movement is still shallow, so after being investigated once last autumn, the prosecution was reserved. He is also under the supervision of others and is being severely reprimanded by the Zochiku-ryo, calling on him to repent.</p>
<p>Tsuemichi Koga, is the younger brother of Baron Koga Tsuemichi. Under the guidance of Takatoshi Hachijo, he organized a strike force and was also a member of the funding activities. He also participated in a political research association in a certain coffee shop in Shindo. He is now also subject to reprimand. Sadanao Yamanaka, is the younger brother of Baron Yamanouchi Masao. He graduated from Gakushuin last spring. When he was in school, he had close contact with Toshimori Mori and others and carried out the movement to expand the funding network. He was also a member of the strike force. When he was active, he was immediately investigated, and the prosecution was soon reserved. He is now also subject to reprimand.</p>
<p>In addition, there are Okura Kinsuke, etc., who are also subject to the same punishment. These are elements that can no longer be concealed. As for those who are suspected of being lighter or have insufficient evidence, they will be temporarily set aside. Why are so many children of the Japanese aristocracy constantly infected with communism?</p>
<p>The reasons are not very complicated. First, the current aristocratic education does not conform to actual life and cannot satisfy the hopes of young people. Second, it is the reflection of the actual social life in Japan. The impoverishment of the masses has shaken the entire Japanese social structure. Therefore, they abandon their positions and participate in the communist movement. This is an important issue in Japan, and it is also worthy of study by people in our motherland.

I hope that you will comply with the above two items immediately and reply by telegram first." (March 26th)</p>

New York Silver Bar: The authorities' crackdown on the activities of silver speculators and the sharp drop in the opening of securities are all unfavorable news for the silver market. Therefore, the silver market opened weak and the popularity was not good. However, although buyers are wary, sellers do not want to sell in a hurry because the authorities' proposal to manage the commodity exchange is not included in silver.</p>

<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>New York Cotton: The cotton market's popularity tends to be bearish. Long positions in May were closed, and spot merchants, banks, and Liverpool also sold, resulting in a decline in market prices.

<p>London: Today's London rubber market was calm. The transaction price for July and September at noon was 5 pence and 3125, which was 32% lower than yesterday.</p>
<p>New York: The rubber market opened weak due to foreign news and the trend of the securities market, but the popularity was still stable, and sellers intended to wait and see.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York: Today, the opening of securities was weak, and many securities fell by 1 pound to 2 pounds.

<p>Yan Huiqing Talks about the International Situation in Hankou</p>
<p>The Relationship between Japan and Russia is Relaxed on the Surface, but Tense in Secret</p>
<p>Our Resumption of Diplomatic Relations with Soviet Russia Should Be Substantive Quickly</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Dr. Yan Huiqing, the ambassador to Russia, went to Nanchang from Beijing a few days ago to visit Chairman Chiang. On the 25th, he passed through Xun from Nanchang and transferred to the Wuxue wheel to the west. He arrived in Hankou at 9:30 am on the 26th and stayed at Dr. Shu Houren's private residence at 20 New Paris in the French Concession. Shu is a relative and friend of Yan, and has been separated for many years. He came to visit him specially and did not have any tasks. Therefore, he did not visit the military and political authorities. At 7 pm, Zhou Zechun, the foreign affairs commissioner of the five provinces, Wu Guozhen, the mayor, and Xi Debing, the superintendent of the Jianghan Customs, held a banquet to welcome Yan. At 9 pm that night, Yan took the Dehe wheel to Beijing. He only stayed in Hankou for half a day. When the reporter interviewed Yan on the wheel, he told me about the recent international situation and the relationship between Japan and Russia, Japan and the United States, and China and Russia. Yan first said that the international situation is becoming more and more urgent, and the great powers are secretly preparing urgently, but they are all unwilling to be the first to start the war. The relationship between Japan and Russia is extremely tense in the core, but the surface shows relaxation, which is why. The reason why I returned to China this time is also because the international situation is urgent, so I need to ask the government for instructions. Yan continued, the US-Japan exchange of notes, because he was on the way, he had not read the full text, only saw the general outline in the newspaper, but each country's diplomacy has its consistent policy, and the world has already seen the US's position. It is not expected that there will be a sudden change for a while. The resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia is watched by the world, but at this time of urgent situation, the resumption of diplomatic relations has its own interests and is inevitable. Yan also talked about the issue of arms reduction, saying that the arms reduction conference has been held for more than a year and has not achieved any results, which is very pessimistic. The representatives of various countries came with important missions, sacrificed a long time, and spent a lot of time talking, but if there is no result in the end, it is really impossible to live up to the entrustment of the people of each country. Therefore, in the future, they may have to seek an end, but the international situation is complicated and remains the same. It is impossible to seek a satisfactory solution. Yan also said that the resumption of diplomatic relations in China is necessary for foreign diplomacy. The first step has been to restore general relations, and the second step should be substantive quickly, at least to seek development in commerce first. For example, the export of tea, Russia needs tea, and it has always relied on our country. However, Russia purchases goods with long-term payments. Chinese merchants have limited capital and lack a united force, so Chinese tea has been taken over by Indian products in the Russian market. I know that Indian tea does not suit the taste of Russians. I hope that Chinese tea merchants will pay attention to unity in the future, cooperate with the banking industry, and improve the quality, then the sales of Chinese tea will not be a problem. After Ambassador Bao of Soviet Russia arrived in China, because the staff was not enough to allocate, although a consulate was established in Tianjin, he also served as the acting director in Ping. Other consulates in Hankou and other places have not been organized and will be established separately to meet the needs in the future. Finally, Yan said that the road to China's rejuvenation is (1) unity and close organization from top to bottom, (2) the number of soldiers should not be too large, and quality is more important than quantity, (3) implement the Three People's Principles, and there is no way to achieve national strength and people's wealth without this. As for his visit to Hankou this time, it was only to visit friends, and he did not disturb the authorities. After arriving in Beijing, he plans to stay for one day, then go to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou, and then to Tianjin. The date of going abroad is undetermined and will be several months later.

<h3>The Inspection Team of Fourteen Provincial Governors Arrives in Nancheng</h3>
<p>Inspects Anti-Banditry Works Along the Way</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Secretaries-General of the governments of eleven provinces, including Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, the heads of the two departments of civil affairs and education, the administrative inspectors, and the generals of Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong provinces, set off on the 20th to eastern Jiangxi to inspect the post-war relief in the area. It was learned from a Fuzhou telephone call that the members of the bandit area inspection team were traveling in eight cars. There was also an armored vehicle sent by the Xingying to protect the rear of the train. County Magistrate Xia and the leaders of various public groups welcomed them at the station. After the inspection team members entered the city and rested briefly, Zhou Zuofu and Xia Chenggang, the leaders of the North Route Army Headquarters, the 7th District Administrative Commissioner's Office, and the Lichuan County Government, led them to visit the Qianjinpo Airport, the southern station of the Ganmin Road, and inspect the electrical grid, trenches, earth city, forts, and blockhouses of Lichuan County. In the evening, the Fuzhou Party, government, and military jointly held a public banquet for the inspection team. During the banquet, they gave speeches to each other, reporting the history of the communist bandits' disaster in Jiangxi, the tragic state of the six counties in the former Gandong Fuzhou that were ravaged, and the situation of joint suppression, which was extremely detailed. It was not until 9 o'clock that the banquet ended. On the morning of the 21st, the inspection team members took the original car and set off from the Ganmin Road to Nancheng. They visited the guard flags protecting the highway blockhouses at the bridgeheads along the highway, and the relics of the communist bandits' harassment. They arrived in Nancheng on the same day. The leaders of the defense area garrison headquarters, the county government, and the county chamber of commerce gathered at the station to welcome them. After resting in the city, they separately visited the junction of Nancheng, Nanfeng, Lichuan, and Guangze and Jianning in Fujian, because that area has been one of the targets of the communist bandits' attacks since the 19th year of the Republic of China. The troops stationed in the city have fought with the bandits one after another. Xu Kexiang, Mao Bingwen, and other troops built extremely solid works here, and the airport was also quite spectacular. After the inspection team completed the inspection here, they returned to the province along the Ganmin Road. (March 24th)</p>
<p>Guangdong Province's Measures to Maintain Paper Money</p>
<p>Expand the Circulation Area of Paper Money</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Inspect Taxes in Various Regions</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The price of paper money issued by the Guangdong Provincial Bank has fallen, and the financial circles in Shantou have been greatly affected. It is found that the Provincial Bank has issued more than 10 million yuan of paper money, and the total amount of various taxes in the province is about 80 million silver yuan per year. If the tax authorities accept as much provincial currency as possible, the more than 10 million paper money will still be insufficient to distribute. As for the military salaries that should be issued to various departments every month, which is about 4 to 5 million yuan, if the counties can circulate and use them as usual, the more than 10 million paper money will also be insufficient. How can there be a risk of low discounts? However, the province's paper money is all concentrated in one corner of Guangzhou City. The salaries that the military supply agencies receive every month are all provincial paper money, which cannot be carried to other counties for use. Therefore, they go to our shops and silver shops to exchange them for silver dollars. The reason why paper money cannot be used in other counties is entirely because the government and tax authorities want to collect silver dollars and discriminate against paper money. This is the main reason why Guangdong's finances have never been on the right track. Qu Fangpu, the Director of Finance, has recently decided on three rescue measures. The first step is to stabilize the financial situation, close more than 180 shops and silver shops in Guangzhou City that collect and find money, and prevent friendly and hostile parties from manipulating and creating rumors, so as to stabilize the financial situation in the market. At the same time, it is stipulated that the purchase and sale of gold and silver can only add three points, and the purchase and sale of commercial warehouse coupons shall not exceed 10% of the original price. This plan has now been implemented, and those who manipulate provincial paper money in the Shantou silver industry are also subject to crackdown. The second step is to expand the sales scope of provincial currency, order all agencies in the province to accept provincial currency, so that the counties can redeem provincial currency as much as possible, and each branch treasury is responsible for full redemption. At the same time, Chen Jitang ordered the military supply officers to carry paper money back to the defense area and convert it to the branch bank or sub-treasury in each county, and shall not exchange it for silver dollars in the province at a lower price. The third step is to implement measures to prevent the silver industry from manipulating secretly, and send tax inspectors to various regions of the province, totaling 14 regions, with one person in each region, stationed in various counties in rotation. This position is equivalent to the former tax inspectors. The inspectors must carefully investigate and report the circulation of provincial paper money, the economic situation, and the amount of tax revenue in each province, and supervise and urge the collection agencies in each province outside the province to accept provincial paper money for those above one yuan. After the above three steps are gradually implemented, the provincial paper money may not return to a low price. (March 22nd)</p>
<h3>Nanhui: Sandun Elementary School Raises Funds</h3>
<p>The Fund Raising Committee of Sandun Volunteer Elementary School, a private school in Nanhui, held a meeting at Yizhixiang, Simalu a few days ago. Among those present were Hu Pu'an, Huang Zao Xiong, Jin Hongxiang, Cheng Weiyu, Gu Wensheng, etc. Hu Pu'an, the chairman of the committee, presided over the meeting and reported that the volunteer school needs a fund to maintain it for a long time, so it is decided to raise 20,000 yuan, which will be directly paid by the fund raisers to the Pudong Bank for collection, and will be completed within the summer vacation. Afterwards, the bank will store it for a long time, and only take the interest without moving the principal. Finally, all the committee members were encouraged to actively solicit donations to achieve the goal. Then, Hu Jingqu and Ni Gongfu, the representatives of the school board, reported on the past situation of the school and the future expansion plan, and thanked the people present for their enthusiastic support. Then, each committee member took the donation receipt book and dispersed to proceed.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Delineation of Various Areas in the Urban and Rural Townships</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Government held a zoning meeting yesterday (27th) and decided to set up two districts in the urban township: (1) Yan Xu Pan, (2) Lou Qi Feng. A total of thirteen districts in the rural area: (1) Hu Wangting, (2) Muduo Shanrenqiao, (3) Guangfu Xiangshan, (4) Hengjing Lishu, (5) Lumu · Wucongjing, (6) Xiangcheng, Tianluo, (7) Beiqiao Huangdai, (8) Weiting Xiaoxi Lujing, (9) Jiaozhi · Xietang, (10) Zhouzhuang, (11) Guoxiang, (12) Dongqianshan, (13) Xishan. The original 840 townships and towns in the county have been reduced to 333, and will be submitted to the construction department for approval.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Carelessness of the Kerosene Boat at Dangqiankou</h3>
<p>A cargo ship belonging to Cai Zhenlin arrived at Dangqiankou in the Fifth District the day before yesterday. It was fully loaded with cylindrical kerosene. Because it was late, it was planned to moor on the shore to rest and cook. Cai Zichang Yuanyin overturned the oil lamp due to carelessness in lighting the lamp, and the entire boat was destroyed. Chang Yuan was seriously injured and his life was in danger. Fortunately, after the tax police bureau received the news, it sent a team to rescue and rescued more than 30 barrels of kerosene.</p>
<h3>Wuxi, Li Bingsheng, et al., Defend Li Shuyun</h3>
<p>Liu Zhuomin, the former chief of the Second Public Security Sub-bureau, concealed firearms and official seals, resisted handover, and implicated Li Shuyun, the wife of Gu Renfa, the former director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, were jointly interrogated and detained by the local county court. The county court also telegraphed Chen Guofu, the chairman of the Jiangsu Province, requesting him to order Gu Renfa to come to Wuxi to surrender and be questioned. This matter has been reported in this newspaper several times. It is now known that Gu Renfa has gone to Hankou and has not returned. The provincial government has already sent a reply telegram. According to the provincial news, Gu Renfa will be transferred, and it is said that Cheng Tianfang, the secretary-general of the provincial government, will succeed him as the director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Yu Jingtang, a committee member, will succeed him as the secretary-general. The details are as follows: When the case occurred, Gu Renfa, the director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, was complying with the telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and went to Jiangxi with Zhou Fohai, the director of the Jiangsu Education Department, to receive instructions. Recently, the public affairs in Jiangxi have been completed. Zhou Fohai returned to the province the day before yesterday, but Gu Renfa did not leave Jiangxi with Zhou. Later, he went to Hankou to make some contacts. After the Jiangsu Provincial Government received the telegram from the Wuxi County Court Procuratorate requesting to order Gu Renfa to come to Wuxi on the 26th to surrender and be questioned, it was noted that Gu had already gone to Hankou and could not rush back to court. Therefore, yesterday, a confidential telegram was sent to the local county government to forward a letter to the County Court Procuratorate for reference. The original telegram stated, "To Magistrate Yan, please forward to the Wuxi County Court Procuratorate for information. The Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Gu Renfa, has gone to Hankou on official business and has not returned. Special announcement, Jiangsu Provincial Government Secretariat, signed."</p>
<p>The reason why the local procuratorate telegraphed Gu Renfa to come to court for questioning this time is also important. Since Li Shuyun and her mother have been transferred to the judicial authorities for handling, the law is equal for everyone. It will not be ignored just because she is the wife of the director, so as not to lose the dignity of the judiciary. Nor will she be easily released just because there is currently insufficient evidence of Li Shuyun's criminal behavior. Therefore, the whistleblower must collect evidence or come to Wuxi to question and clarify before a final verdict can be made. If the witnesses and physical evidence are indeed correct, they will of course be interrogated according to the law. If there is no solid evidence, a decision not to prosecute will be made.</p>
<p>Huang Yiou, a current member of the Legislative Yuan (the son of the martyr Huang Kecheng), resides at No. 15, Xinmin Village, Malang Road, Shanghai. Li Shuyun and her mother were arrested at Huang's residence this time. Yesterday, Huang Yiou issued a statement,</p>
<p>stating, "Around 4 p.m. on the 20th, my (Huang's self-reference) house was suddenly searched by detectives, which was unexpected. Whether Ms. Li is related to Liu Zhuomin's case, I do not know. Ms. Li and I are fellow villagers, and I am also a friend of Director Gu. When Ms. Li was studying, she was a classmate of my wife. When Gu proposed to Ms. Li, Gu claimed that he had no one to help him at home. However, after Ms. Li married Gu, she discovered that Gu not only had a wife but also many children. Therefore, her relationship with Gu broke down. Recently, I heard that Gu's first wife wanted to sue Gu for bigamy, and Ms. Li also came to Shanghai to sue Gu Renfa for bigamy and request a divorce. Now she has been arrested suddenly. The implication of this, how can it not make people ponder?" Yesterday, Li Shuyun's uncles, Li Bingsheng and Li Huaichen, submitted a letter to Chen Guofu, the chairman of the Jiangsu Province, to defend their niece, recounting the events. Their letter is as follows: "To Chairman Chen of the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, my niece Shuyun is the second wife of Gu Renfa, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of your government. Suddenly, on [date missing], she and her mother were arrested by the police and sent to the Second Special District Court. The next day, Liu Anxi and others, representatives of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, came to Shanghai with documents, claiming to request extradition. According to them, it was related to the case of Liu Zhuomin, the chief of the Wuxi Public Security Sub-bureau, resisting handover, which caused my niece Shuyun to feel extremely bewildered. The appointment and removal of officials are naturally within the authority of the provincial government and the Civil Affairs Department. Who is my niece Shuyun? How could she participate? As for saying that Chief Liu resisted handover and that it was related to my niece Shuyun, it is even more unreasonable. Moreover, according to the Wuxi People's Daily, Liu Zhuomin was ordered to be dismissed on the 15th of this month, handed over on the 17th, and was arrested on the 18th. At that time, my niece Shuyun had already come to Shanghai for medical treatment and knew nothing about it from beginning to end. Yet she was implicated and her elderly mother was imprisoned at the same time, which is truly incomprehensible. After repeated inquiries, it is obvious that it is a malicious frame-up. When Director Gu and my niece Shuyun got engaged, he stated that his first wife had died. After the marriage, the news of his bigamy gradually leaked out. My niece Shuyun, being young and energetic, blamed him for fraud, and there may have been conflicts. Gu's original wife then used the threat of legally prosecuting and reporting bigamy to intimidate him. Gu regarded my niece Shuyun as a thorn in his side, always wanting to put her to death to avoid future troubles. Having no other way out, he did not hesitate to abuse his public office for personal gain, using the Liu case as an excuse to fabricate charges, intending to trap my niece Shuyun to death in order to protect his own position and cover up his crime of bigamy. Moreover, from a legal point of view, if Gu, as the director of the Civil Affairs Department, has an unvirtuous wife who dares to interfere in the advancement and retreat of local officials, then Gu himself already bears extremely serious responsibility and should first recuse himself. How can he still exercise the functions of the Civil Affairs Department? From this point of view, it is even more obvious that he colluded with his original wife to deliberately frame her. My niece Shuyun, a weak woman, was first deceived into marriage and then framed. She holds grievances and anger, making it difficult to bear even death. In addition to filing a lawsuit according to the law and announcing the facts, we respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration and earnestly request your intervention to redress the wrong. We await your urgent orders."</p>

<p>The Wu County Public Security Bureau recently drafted a plan to reorganize the sub-bureaus and stations and has submitted it to the Civil Affairs Department for approval. However, the No. 1 police station of the Eighth Sub-bureau in Qianheng Town, the No. 3 directly-governed station in Banshang Town, and the No. 1 police station in Yaoguanxiang Town were requested to be abolished due to lack of funds. Director Xu Baoguang presented this matter at the county government's administrative meeting on the 26th, where it was resolved to abolish them. Director Xu issued orders accordingly and dispatched personnel to complete the termination and report.

<h3>Yangzhou: Yangzhou-Zhong Car Officially Opens</h3>
<p>The Yangzhou-Zhong long-distance bus company in Jiangbei initially traveled along the canal embankment through Gao Bao to Qing Huai. However, soon after the opening, it suffered a severe flood, resulting in huge losses. It then went west, bypassing Anhui Province, through Tianchang, Tongcheng, Xuyi, Jiangba, and other places, to Qingjiang-Zhong, a distance of hundreds of miles. The three-year project cost millions. The Yangzhou-Tianchang section was opened earlier at the end of last year. The road from Tianchang to Qingjiang will be officially opened by the end of this month, after day and night construction, and will be connected to the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang bus line.

<h3>Nantong: Jingjiang Fraud Case Cracked in Tong</h3>
<p>Recently, a group of itinerant swindlers have been defrauding people in various counties in Jiangbei. Sun Wu and others, under the pretext of using talismans to cure diseases, defrauded Liu Liansheng, the director of the Jingjiang County Public Funds and Property Office, of over 4,000 yuan in gold, pearls, cash, and foreign currency.

On the 29th, the various departments using the funds will publicly elect suitable personnel to take over as director.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang: Garrison Troops Block Earth Embankment Gate</h3>
<p>There are two gaps in the earth embankment wall north of Huaiyin. One is behind the Copper Coin Bureau, which was opened by the 25th Route stationed troops in the past to facilitate automobile traffic. The other is behind the Ghost God Altar, which was left for foreigners living outside the embankment in the past to enter and exit. Currently, the 25th Route has been transferred elsewhere, and the foreign residence behind the Ghost God Altar has long been sold and no one goes in or out. As a result, several robbery cases have occurred on Hebei Street this month, all entering and exiting through these gaps. Cao Pang, the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Garrison Security Team, inquired about the above situation. For the sake of facilitating defense, in addition to dispatching teams to be stationed separately, he specifically ordered the soldiers to block the two gaps to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>A Fair Discussion on the Draft Constitution by Zhang Yuanruo</h3>
<p>(1) Legal Principles of the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>Recently, I have firmly believed in the meaning of "national salvation through self-reliance" (Note 1). I always seek from myself and blame myself and act automatically. I do not want to discuss the shortcomings of others. The universe and truth each have their own norms, and the schools of law in the world are different. Leaving the master and entering the slave is deeply resented by scholars, and favoring the same and disliking the different is not the style of politicians. Moreover, our country is in the aftermath of the revolution, at the time of the transition between the new and the old. The spirit of the constitution of modern constitutional countries has various unavoidable defects due to the changes of the times and the proof of facts. When we drafted the constitution, there were no teachers in the past and few models in the near future. We cannot deviate from the principles of constitutionalism, and we cannot completely follow the old ways of the past. Carrying on the past and opening up the future, learning from the past and being cautious in the future, the difficulty of this matter is self-evident (Note 2). Therefore, our judgments today should be able to weigh the pros and cons and consider the gains and losses. If we only base ourselves on prejudices and argue, we will not only be insufficient to reveal the true meaning of things, but may also hinder the development of constitutionalism. This is the original intention of what I call a "fair discussion."</p>
<p>In the past few days, I have browsed the draft constitution and silently observed public opinion. I deeply feel that there is a prerequisite that we cannot ignore when commenting on the constitution, that is, the legal principles on which the constitution is based. Otherwise, all debates and disputes will not only be empty words, but will also cause disputes.</p>
<p>Examining the constitutions of various countries, each has its own special spirit and consistent legal principles. The spirit of the French Revolution is individual liberalism, which is a resistance to monarchical autocracy. Therefore, its legal principles are, on the one hand, the extreme theory of natural human rights, and on the other hand, the theory of national sovereignty (Note 3). The spirit of the Soviet Russian Revolution is extreme socialism, which is a reaction to the parliamentary democratic politics after the French Revolution. Therefore, on the one hand, it fundamentally denies the so-called natural human rights and has a provision that those who do not work shall not eat. On the other hand, it vigorously implements the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, the constitution only has class rights, and does not guarantee the private rights and political rights of the general people (Note 4). The Weimar Constitution after the German Revolution, its basic spirit is social democracy. Therefore, on the one hand, it guarantees the rights of the people, but on the other hand, it must be restricted by law in terms of social interests. On the one hand, it recognizes the principle of democracy, and at the same time innovates the traditional representative system (Note 5). The legal system of Italian Fascism is based on a kind of national socialism. Therefore, on the one hand, it opposes the extreme individual liberalism, taking the individual as a tool of the state, not the ultimate goal of society. The state is an absolute sovereign, and the power of the state is higher than everything and can control everything. On the other hand, it also opposes communism that obliterates individualism. All economic activities that endanger the life and progress of the country are strictly prohibited. However, if it does not harm the interests of the country, individual enterprises are not only not prohibited, but are also regarded as the most powerful and valuable driving force for developing national production (Note 6). Therefore, the constitutions of various countries are generally a product of revolution and history. On the one hand, they represent the spirit of an era, and on the other hand, they have their social and historical background (Note 7). It is rare for a few constitutional experts to be able to fabricate them behind closed doors, let alone copy and transplant them, and say that they can be effectively implemented.</p>
<p>Although we do not want to use the established prejudices of traditional legalists to examine today's draft constitution, what are the legal principles on which the draft constitution itself is based? We should conduct the earliest research. As stated in Article 1 of the initial draft of the Constitution, "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People," then the legal principles that should be based on it are very clear and there is no need to doubt them. Whether the Three Principles of the People can be the basic legal principles of our country's constitution is a matter of great controversy among contemporary scholars. I have made detailed arguments in Chapter 3 of my humble work "Modern Constitutionalism" (Basic Principles of Chinese Constitutionalism), which I will not repeat here. However, looking at the entire constitution, one cannot help but suspect that the legal principles on which it is based are not consistent from beginning to end, and there are many contradictions. There are contradictions between individualism and socialism, and contradictions between laissez-faireism and interventionism. For example, the provisions of Chapter 2 regarding the rights and obligations of the people clearly show a spirit of anti-individualism, anti-liberalism, and denial of natural human rights. However, the provisions of Chapter 5 regarding the election of the National Assembly and Chapter 7 regarding the central political system mostly imitate the old system of traditional representative politics in various countries. In addition, there are many contradictions with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. As for the lack of connection between the front and the back, and even the same chapter, the legal principles are also incompatible, which is unavoidable. I will not discuss all these points here, and I will discuss them further in the following article.</p>
<p>(2) General Principles</p>
<p>(1) Before the general principles, it is possible to add a preface and list it as the first chapter to show the characteristics of our nation and the spirit of the revolution. Examine the post-war German constitution, that is, before the first chapter, it is crowned with a preface, the text says, "The German people unite their races, with one heart and one mind, together look forward to transforming the country, forever existing in the realm of freedom and justice, maintaining peace at home and abroad, and promoting social evolution, so they create this constitution." The first chapter of the Soviet Union's rich law also has a long declaration, declaring its social revolution and the spirit of world revolution, with great momentum and unique characteristics. Our country's revolution has its own special mission, and the inherent spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, integrity, justice, harmony, and peace of our nation is unmatched by any modern country. Moreover, the constitution has the function of political education, so at this time of internal and external troubles, mutual persecution, and the country's and people's lives are in danger, our country's constitution must not only imitate the legacy of Europe and the United States, but should have an extremely solemn spirit of national education, in order to save the people's will and revive the people's spirit, establish the foundation for national prosperity and strength, and deeply plant the new opportunity for national rejuvenation (Note 8). This is why I advocate adding a preface.</p>
<p>(2) Article 1 of the draft constitution stipulates that "The Republic of China is a republic based on the Three Principles of the People." At the moment, public opinion is in an uproar and they are blaming each other. Here, we should first abandon all feelings of political urgency, and at the same time, we cannot suddenly obliterate the true meaning of the doctrine because of the achievements of the party rule over the years. The true meaning of the Three Principles of the People, rather than being said to be the proposition of one party, Ning considers it to be the three major principles of establishing a country. The three principles of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood are the great ways followed by ancient and modern times, and are especially the three major problems that our country urgently needs to solve. Although Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will may be incomplete (according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his preface to his doctrine, there is a phrase to correct the omissions), the principles he showed, in all fairness, can be called weighing the pros and cons and are very suitable for our country's national conditions. Therefore, the party members must not consider it to be a "patent," and the Republic of China must not ignore the needs of the nation because of its party opinions. I have said that the constitutions of various countries are all revolutionary historical products, and they have their social and historical backgrounds. The spirit and mission of our country's revolution are different from the revolutions of any country in the world, and the history and characteristics of the Chinese nation cannot be compared with other countries. Why can our country's constitution steal the established laws of others? Moreover, European and American constitutionalism has its unavoidable defects, and the Soviet Russian revolution has increasingly shown its worsening (Note 9). Why should we abandon our nation's self-confidence and be obsessed with "imported" constitutions and copy incomplete articles from others? This is what I said from a pure national constitutional standpoint, without any party relations or political feelings, and with a humble and fair attitude. I hope that the wise men of the country will discuss it together, and especially hope that the Kuomintang people can understand this and work hard to encourage it.</p>
<p>(3) Article 4, regarding the provisions on territory, adopts the enumerated principle, which seems to be more appropriate than Wu's case. It is true that modern constitutions have a strong spirit of nationalism, and the constitutions of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Romania, and other countries have a spirit of national independence and resistance to imperialism. We do not have to completely imitate them, but in recent years, our country has suffered from the invasion of strong enemies, and in general, the people have a vague impression of the territory of the country. Therefore, our provisions on territory, from the standpoint of nationalism and the function of political education, cannot be taken lightly. It is necessary to take it seriously and write it in detail. Regarding this idea, I have discussed it in detail in my humble work "Modern Constitutionalism," which I will not repeat one by one.</p>
<h3>(3) Rights and Obligations of the People</h3>
<p>(1) The title of Chapter 2 of the draft constitution should be preceded by the words "basic" in order to be accurate, because the rights and obligations of the people are very complicated, and what is stipulated in the constitution is difficult to be detailed and exhaustive in fact, this is one reason. Second, the draft constitution adopts the indirect legal protection principle for the rights and obligations of the people, then how to exercise the rights and obligations stipulated in the constitution must be supplemented by ordinary law, so the word basic cannot be omitted, this is the second reason. (2) Chapter 2 of the draft constitution adopts the indirect legal protection principle for the rights of the people, and does not provide direct protection in the constitution, which is the focus of opposition from contemporary sages. The reasons are nothing more than two points: one is that the various freedoms listed in the draft constitution are a kind of "natural human rights," and the constitution can only recognize them, not restrict them by law. The second is that constitutional protection has the highest effective force, while legal protection can only slightly restrict the administrative organs. In the future, how the legislation will stipulate and restrict the rights of the people cannot be prevented. If it is autocratic, the danger is worrying. This kind of argument, if viewed purely from the standpoint of protecting civil rights, is also reasonable. What else can we say? However, in terms of legislative technology, there is still room for discussion, because no matter how detailed and comprehensive the constitutional provisions are, it is difficult to be very specific in fact, because the rights of the people often treat each other, and if restrictions are not properly set, they will inevitably interfere with each other. Therefore, the rights stipulated in the constitution, no matter how careful and appropriate they are in principle, must still rely on ordinary laws to specify them concretely. Therefore, the current French constitution does not have any provisions on the rights of the people. During the French constitutional era in 1789, the parliament also opposed including the "Declaration of Human Rights" in the constitution, but France is a pioneering country of modern civil rights revolution, and its development of the spirit of civil rights is also more intense than any other country. The German constitution of 1891 also has no such provisions at all. Although the Gramma constitution after the revolution in 1919 specifically set up a chapter on the basic rights and obligations of the people, it still sets many legal restrictions on the rights of the people, but the civil rights of the German people have not lost their protection because of this. (3) Here, what I must emphasize is that I do not mean that Chapter 2 of the draft constitution has reached the realm of perfection. Article 8 of the draft constitution does not provide adequate and effective protection for the freedom of the people's bodies, such as when they are illegally infringed, which is even worse than Wu's draft, because Article 8 of the draft constitution only has the provision that "the court shall not refuse the aforementioned application, and the executive organ shall not refuse the court's request for review and interrogation," while Wu's case still has the further provision that "those who violate the aforementioned three provisions shall be punished as private imprisonment and shall bear the responsibility for compensation for damages." Although we do not want to be superstitious about the old saying of natural human rights (Note 10), and the extreme laissez-faire liberalism is also intolerable by modern social relations (Note 11), we are deeply afraid of the darkness of our country's judicial organs, the lack of legal system of general administrative organs, and the pain of illegal infringement suffered by the people over the years, then on the legacy of the principle of civil rights and the mission of the national revolution, we must seek a way to thoroughly liberate and provide a kind of relief provision in the constitution. Reasoning from this principle, we advocate adding the following amendments to Article 8 of the draft constitution: (1) There should be provisions for the time limit for the court to interrogate in order to avoid the suffering of the people from being detained indefinitely. Article 29 of the Spanish constitution stipulates that "after being transferred to the主管法院, the detention shall be revoked within seventy-two hours, or the犯 shall be sentenced to監禁", which can be used as a reference. (2) The original provision of compensation for damages in Wu's case should still be adopted. (3) Who should bear the responsibility for compensation? The amount of compensation should also be specified so as to avoid emptiness and achieve practical results. Article 106 of the Spanish constitution, Article 19 of the Mexican constitution, and Article 11 of the Greek constitution can all be used as references.</p>
<p>(4) Furthermore, in Articles 11, 13, and 14, the word "stop" seems to be too heavy and can be deleted, because the word restriction is enough to provide relief. Also, the provisions of Article 23 are empty and boundless and should be specified concretely and separately. Because some freedoms, such as the basic freedoms of the people, the constitutions of various countries can only restrict or stop them when the national security is seriously endangered. They cannot be summarized by the empty words of "social order and public interest." Moreover, the next article 90 of the constitution does not have a word for how martial law should be declared, so more specific provisions should be made here in advance. According to the spirit of the principle of civil rights, it is not an excessive argument. Articles 38 and 39 of Wu's case are more detailed and can be used as a reference. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Three Airline Routes Flew Out Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong and Northbound Flights Have Not Yet Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shanghai Aviation News Agency reports that the local area was still overcast and foggy yesterday morning, but the weather in other areas was good, so China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou westbound flight, Shanghai-Beiping northbound flight, and Shanghai-Guangdong southbound flight all departed as scheduled. However, the flight to Guangdong departed too late and only passed Fuzhou around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, so it is feared that it will be difficult to reach Guangzhou last night. As for the northbound flight from Guangdong, which was supposed to arrive in Shanghai on Sunday, it is still stranded in Xiamen due to bad weather there yesterday.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the company previously planned to purchase powerful aircraft so that it could fly from Shanghai to Chengdu in one day. It is now known that the aircraft can only fly to Chongqing at most, and there will be separate aircraft flying between Chongqing and Chengdu.</p>
<h3>Southwest Review Society Discusses Ban Hong Incident</h3>
<p>Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday and Issued Declaration</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Central Government to Send Personnel to Demarcate Boundaries</p>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reports that the Southwest Review Society held an emergency meeting at Fudan University yesterday to discuss how to respond to the British troops' forceful occupation of Ban Hong. Over ten people attended, including Yang Jiaqing, Li Zengzhong, and Duan Hongbao. First, President Yang Jiaqing reported on the British troops' forceful occupation, and provided a very detailed explanation of the terrain and location of Ban Hong and the history of the boundary demarcation. Then, various staff members successively expressed their opinions. As a result, the following key items were resolved:</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>(1) Telegraph the Central Government to immediately send personnel to demarcate the boundaries. (2) Telegraph the Yunnan Provincial Government to immediately send troops nearby to protect Ban Hong and order the arrest of traitor Ma and others. (3) Support organizations across the country on this matter and expand publicity. (4) Publish as much text as possible about this matter in this publication. (5) Issue a declaration to awaken the attention of the people of the country.</p>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
<p>In recent years, national affairs have been turbulent and foreign disputes have been frequent. The lost territories in the Northeast have not yet been recovered, and Ban Hong in Yunnan Province was recently occupied by British troops. The alarming news spread, and the whole country was shocked. Ban Hong is located in western Yunnan, bordering British Burma, and is extremely rich in mineral deposits. The government, due to traffic congestion, is unable to reach it. The British have been coveting it for a long time. Now, taking advantage of the fact that our government has no time to care about the border, they have brazenly disregarded justice, sent troops to occupy it, transported a large number of machines, and forcibly mined. Furthermore, in order to achieve their goal of aggression, they did not hesitate to use cruel means to instigate the various ethnic groups on our border to kill each other. Their intentions are extremely vicious. If this matter is not thoroughly resolved, then once Ban Hong is lost, it is inevitable that the rest of western Yunnan will be nibbled away. Gradually, the entire province will become a continuation of the Northeast. The hearts of our colleagues are worried, and it is difficult to remain silent. In addition to requesting the government to quickly send high-ranking officials to investigate, we also hope that the people of the whole country will unite and stand behind the government, argue rationally, and resolve the border worries as soon as possible. This declaration is hereby issued for your public consideration.</p>
<h3>French Female Aviator Will Not Fly to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Rescheduled to Depart on Thursday</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Beiping, March 27th dispatch: French female aviator Hélène Boucher was originally scheduled to fly from Beiping to Shanghai at 6:00 AM tomorrow (i.e., today). However, due to unfavorable weather reports, the departure has been rescheduled to Thursday.</p>
<h3>Former Turkish Prince Now in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Driven Out by the Japanese, Willing to Accept Chinese Protection</p>
<p>Denies Going to Xinjiang to Seek a Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the TASS News Agency recently reported that a former Turkish prince, exploited by the Japanese, had gone from Shanghai to Xinjiang to seek a puppet organization. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren denied that the former prince had left Shanghai. A Central News Agency reporter made special inquiries yesterday morning to all parties, and the situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Driven Out by the Japanese</h3>
<p>The former prince, originally named Mohammed, had been living in Japan for a long time. When he was there, he associated exclusively with Japanese rogues and lawless elements and was noted by the Japanese side. However, due to lack of evidence, it was not convenient to intervene immediately. Later, the former prince accumulated a large debt to a Japanese merchant, leading to a lawsuit. The Japanese side, because he could not clear the debt and because he was trying to conspire, expelled him from the country. He was then escorted to Shanghai on a Japanese ship; this occurred ten days ago.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Attention</h3>
<p>After being expelled and arriving in Shanghai, the former prince changed his surname and name, hid in a small hotel in Hongkou, and claimed to be Jewish. This was soon learned by our municipal government, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to his residence to investigate. Because his words were evasive and he denied being the former Turkish prince, it was thought that his answers were not very credible, so personnel were sent to inquire from all parties. Only then was the previous situation learned.</p>
<h3>Willing to Live in the Chinese Quarter</h3>
<p>After learning the details, the municipal government sent personnel to welcome the former prince to move to the Chinese quarter to live. Because foreign telegrams reported that he had been exploited by the Japanese to go to Xinjiang to seek a puppet organization, he was asked about this. He immediately denied it and said that he had been expelled from Japan and would no longer be exploited by them. To dispel external doubts, he voluntarily resided in the Chinese quarter for a long time and accepted the protection of the Chinese authorities. The municipal government has agreed to his request, giving him preferential treatment and protection. As for his place of residence, the authorities did not allow it to be announced.</p>
<h3>Ministries of Communications and Railways Approve Nine Companies Including Sanbei to Participate in Joint Transportation</h3>
<p>Shipping Association Decides to Comply with Orders and Report</p>
<p>Datong and Other Companies Resolve to Strive for Participation Again</p>
<p>After the Ministries of Communications and Railways stipulated methods for the case of private shipping companies requesting to participate in water and land joint transportation, the Shanghai Shipping Trade Association submitted petitions from its member companies to the Ministries of Communications and Railways for review. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Joint Ministry Approval</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Communications and Railways approved the Shipping Trade Association's telegram stating, "One telegram: the case of private shipping companies being approved to participate in water and land joint transportation has not yet been approved. Please give instructions as soon as possible so that it can be implemented soon." "Having examined the telegram, the association previously submitted 32 petitions from various shipping companies regarding the case of private shipping companies requesting to participate in water and land joint transportation. The two ministries sent personnel to review them together, and a reply was issued. Now, it is found that the claims in the petitions of Sanbei Wheel Wharf Company, Zhengji Steamship Company, Hong'an Shipping Company, Ningshao Shipping Company, Dazhen Shipping Company, Dayu Steamship Company, Huxing Shipping Company, China United Shipping Company, and Dada Steamship Company, and other nine companies are in line with the provisions of item one of the methods for private shipping companies to participate in water and land joint transportation. However, for each of these companies' usual shipping routes, which wharves or lighters and warehouses are self-owned and which are leased, please instruct them to distinguish them in detail, one by one, and respond with a list for verification. As for which roads will be allowed to handle joint transportation, this will be determined after the list is submitted to the ministry. Furthermore, since Sanbei Wheel Wharf Company and Hong'an Shipping Company are not the same company, they should be stated separately. All other companies either have no fixed route or do not have self-owned wharves and warehouses, which does not comply with the previously promulgated methods. Please postpone discussion. Please instruct them to comply with this reply." Issued by Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, and Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways.</p>
<h3>Circular to Comply</h3>
<p>After receiving the joint approval of the two ministries, the Shipping Trade Association recorded the original approval and copied it to various member shipping companies to comply with. It also decided that after the members reported, it would submit a detailed list of each company's wharves, lighters, and warehouses to the ministry. According to a Xinhua News Agency reporter's inquiry to the shipping industry yesterday, of the 32 petitions submitted, only nine, including Sanbei Company, passed the review of the Ministries of Communications and Railways. As for Datong Steamship Company, all of its wharves and warehouses in various ports are self-owned and have the same routes as Dada Steamship Company. Now that Dada Company is qualified and Datong Company is not, it has been decided that the Shipping Trade Association will petition the ministry again to strive for qualification.</p>

<h3>Postal Affairs Associations Present the Central Government Again with the Solidify Postal System Plan</h3>
<p>Based on the Implementation Outline, Merge the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau</p>
<p>And Order the Ministry of Communications to Stop Subsidizing Airlines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union presented the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications with a document stating: "We, the unions, believe that the postal economy is in a dire state of collapse, and in May of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), we proposed a plan to solidify the postal foundation in order to save it. This plan has now been developed by the Postal Economic System Research Committee into an implementation outline in June of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), and submitted to the Executive Yuan for adoption and implementation. In August of the same year, the Executive Yuan drafted opinions and submitted them to the Central Political Conference for approval. At the end of last year, there was news of the abolition of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau in accordance with the plan, but this became a pipe dream because the case had not gone through the legislative process. It has been eight months since the Central Political Conference approved the plan. Regarding the legislative part, the Central Political Conference also decided at the same time that it must be reviewed and transferred to the Legislative Yuan. It is expected that the relevant ministries and committees have also been handling it for some time. Now, the postal economy is in a state of increasing urgency, and the desire to realize the plan to solidify the postal foundation is also becoming more pressing. We urge your governments (conferences) to request the National Government to quickly order the Executive and Legislative Yuans, and the Ministry of Communications, to actively handle the relevant parts of the plan to solidify the postal foundation, so that it can be implemented as soon as possible and save the postal system. Furthermore, in addition to the separation of postal savings and remittances from the postal system, the unlimited subsidies to airlines is also a major cause of the collapse of the postal economy. In the implementation outline of the plan to solidify the postal foundation, the Postal Economic System Research Committee made the following recommendation regarding aviation subsidies: 'Airlines are a new construction of transportation, and the postal system should help them develop if there is a surplus. However, the postal economy is currently in difficulty and is unable to provide subsidies. Once the postal economy improves, assistance should be considered and used as a loan.' According to this, it is commonly recognized that the postal system cannot continue to bear aviation subsidies under the current circumstances. However, since the closure of the Postal Research Committee, the post office has not received a clear order to stop paying. It is found that the postal system has subsidized the two airlines over 10 million yuan in the past. This year's budget subsidizes China National Aviation Corporation by 1.04 million, and Eurasia Aviation Corporation by 360,000, for a total of 1.4 million. The postal system has reached a point where it cannot support itself. How can it withstand further heavy extraction? Aviation subsidies are like bone-eroding maggots to the postal system today. If it is not stopped quickly, the postal system will not be able to bear the burden, and the difficulties will deepen. Now, in order to protect the postal service, the postal system should immediately stop paying aviation subsidies. If the aviation industry is considered important and cannot be abandoned, then its funding must be found elsewhere and must not burden the postal system again. This is the best of both worlds. We urge your ministries (conferences) to quickly order the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Communications to order the Post Office to immediately stop paying subsidies to China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation in order to protect the postal system. The above two matters, one requesting the ministries and academies to immediately implement the plan to solidify the postal foundation, and one requesting the post office to immediately stop paying aviation subsidies, are both urgently needed to save the postal system. In addition to submitting them separately, we are submitting this document to request your ministries (conferences) to quickly request the National Government to issue orders for implementation. We are extremely anxious."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Merchants Oppose Increase in Water Freight, Chongqing Chamber of Commerce Mediates</h3>
<p>Freight is Divided into Flood Season, Normal Water, and Dry Season Three Periods Annually</p>
<p>A New Method is Agreed Upon to Take Effect on April 1st</p>
<p>Foreign Shipping Companies in Shanghai Are Not Very Satisfied</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the Sichuan River shipping companies implemented a cooperative alliance and increased water freight, the Chongqing merchants in Shanghai protested and uniformly refused to load cargo. After mediation by the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, a solution has been decided and will be implemented on April 1st. The allied Shanghai companies held a meeting to discuss the details below.</p>
<h3>After the Cargo Refusal</h3>
<p>The British Jardine Matheson, Taikoo, the French Messageries Fluviales de Chine, the American Yangtze Rapid Steamship Company, the Italian Italian China Navigation Company, the Chinese China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the private Sanbei, Minsheng, and other companies operating on the Yangtze River upstream, in view of the fact that the ships carrying heavy loads on the Yangtze River cannot navigate, resulting in income not covering expenses, have successively implemented increased water freight in Shanghai, Hankou, Shashi, Yichang, and other places since the 11th of last month. The Chongqing merchant groups protested, and the Shanghai Suzhou goods group and others stopped handling cargo and refused to transport it, resulting in a sharp decrease in cargo on each voyage. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and other ships temporarily suspended sailings due to lack of cargo to load.</p>
<h3>Meeting Held in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Wen Shaohe, chairman of the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, along with Zhao Zisheng, chairman of the Chongqing Shipping Association, convened a meeting of various groups and shipping companies in Chongqing at 1:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. Representatives of the silk yarn group, Chen Huafeng and Deng Ziwen, the Suzhou goods group, Fei Hongzhou, Minsheng Shipping Company, Deng Huayi, Taikoo Shipping Company, Lu Xingbei, and other representatives of various groups and shipping companies attended. Chairman Wen Shaohe first had the representatives of each group and the representatives of each shipping company state the reasons for their opposition and increase. After the chairman's persuasion, all parties agreed to decide on a new method.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>The new method is as follows: Goods transported from Shanghai to Chongqing will be divided into three periods annually: flood season, normal water, and dry season. The flood season is five, six, seven, and eight months. The normal water is three, four, nine, and ten months. The dry season is used as the standard, and the rest are inferred by analogy. The flood season is 8 yuan per package, the normal water season is 12 yuan per package, and the driest season is 16 yuan per package. Suzhou goods are calculated by the number of boxes. Freight is divided into two types, A and B. For each cubic foot, type A is 5 jiao and type B is 2 jiao 8 fen during the flood season; type A is 7 jiao 5 fen and type B is 5 jiao 5 fen during the normal water season; type A is 1 yuan and type B is 7 jiao 3 fen during the dry season. Paper goods, hardware, dried vegetables, and other goods are calculated according to cotton yarn, in kilograms.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Implementation</h3>
<p>After the new method was decided, the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce, the Shipping Association, and the various groups and shipping companies telegraphed a report to Shanghai. A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from the Shanghai Chongqing Suzhou goods group that the group had received a telegram from Chongqing to follow the new method and start implementation on April 1st. They will immediately resume handling goods and prepare to reload cargo. It is said that after this new method is decided, there will be no loss in calculating freight in the future when reporting transportation.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Gather to Discuss</h3>
<p>After receiving the telegram from Chongqing, the allied shipping companies, such as the British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, the American Yangtze Rapid, the Italian Italian China Navigation, the French Messageries Fluviales de Chine, and the Chinese Sanbei Minsheng, held a joint meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday to discuss it. It is said that Minsheng Company had no objections from the Shanghai branch because the Chongqing head office had already agreed. However, the Shanghai head offices of the foreign companies Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Italian China Navigation, and Messageries Fluviales de Chine, whose Chongqing offices are all branch offices, expressed dissatisfaction with the new method and intended to add to it again.</p>
<h3>Maritime Administration Conference Discusses Methods for Recovering Inland Water Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>The recovery of inland water navigation rights has been rumored for many years but has never been realized, resulting in the failure of our country's shipping industry to develop. Now, when the Sino-British and Sino-US commercial treaties are about to expire and be revised, the Shanghai shipping merchants have petitioned the Central Government, requesting that the lost right to navigate inland waterways be recovered during the treaty revision. Mr. Shen Jiyun, the general shipowner of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was among the Shanghai representatives attending this Maritime Administration Conference and returned to Shanghai yesterday. The reporter immediately went to ask him about the important motions. Mr. Shen showed the reporter the record of motions, which showed that many motions were proposed by maritime administration bureaus and offices in various places. The most important motion was the recovery of inland water navigation rights. This was proposed by the conference for discussion. The methods were divided into the following five items:</p>
<h3>Register Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>Foreign merchants' ships sailing in various parts of China do not register with our Maritime Administration Bureau or the Ministry of Communications, allowing foreign merchants' ships to be freely added without any restrictions. Now, the registration procedures for foreign merchants' ships in China must first be completed, so that their tonnage can be restricted and the goal of recovering navigation rights can be gradually achieved.</p>
<h3>Inspection and Measurement</h3>
<p>Domestic merchant ships have long been subject to this practice, but foreign merchant ships alone refuse to comply. Despite repeated negotiations, no results have been achieved. This matter concerns our national sovereignty, and the government should be requested to negotiate with various countries to ensure that foreign ships in China are uniformly inspected.</p>
<h3>Crew Certification</h3>
<p>Certification of domestic ship crews was implemented by the Ministry [of Transportation] last year, but this is not the case for crews on foreign merchant ships. Therefore, the piloting skills of foreign crew members are unknown. It is now necessary to start with the senior crew members on foreign merchant ships and have them certified by us. Those who do not meet the standards should not be allowed to fill positions indiscriminately, to ensure maritime safety.</p>
<h3>Recovering Pilotage</h3>
<p>The pilotage rights at various trading ports have long been controlled by foreign pilots. For example, in Shanghai, among more than forty pilots, only two are Chinese after much effort. In Tianjin, among nine pilots, the Chinese had just managed to secure one position, which was recently squeezed out by a certain country. Pilotage is extremely important, especially during wartime. China should recover all pilotage rights at trading ports and have them filled by Chinese nationals.</p>
<h3>Passenger Tax Collection</h3>
<p>Foreign ships have the greatest influence over inland waterway navigation rights, depriving us of business. A passenger tax should be stipulated and collected by our country for passengers on all foreign merchant ships traveling to our ports, as a form of restriction. As for the recovery of navigation rights from foreign merchant ships, either the ships should be bought back by our country with funds, or the foreign ships should become shareholders and be incorporated into our national navigation agencies. During the transition period, they should be recognized as part of the shareholding, and repayments can be gradually made in the future. The conference felt that this approach was very practical and has resolved to submit it to the Ministry for approval, requesting gradual implementation of the recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Tracks of Notable Figures</h3>
<p>Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong and Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weichi took the night train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Pioneer Lu Xingong's Coffin to be Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The 31st of this month</p>
<p>Our country's revolutionary pioneer, Mr. Lu Xingong, passed away due to heart disease at his residence in Beiping on June 12th of last year. At that time, because the Japanese bandits were threatening North China, and Beiping and Tianjin were in imminent danger, his family, in order to honor the deceased's lifelong commitment to saving the country and forgetting personal matters, did not send out obituaries to relatives and friends. Therefore, few people outside knew about it. Now his family has scheduled to receive funeral certificates in Beiping on the 29th of this month and transport the coffin to Shanghai on the 31st, to be buried in the Shanghai Municipal Council Cemetery in Hongqiao on April 3rd. Another scholar and politician of our country has passed, which is truly lamentable. Here is a brief account of Mr. Lu's life: Mr. Lu's name was Xin, courtesy name Xingong, and he was from Shunde, Guangdong. He had great ambitions from a young age, taking saving the country as his responsibility. At the age of eighteen, the Hong Kong China Daily advocated revolution, and because of admiration for his talent, he was invited to write. Later, when studying in Japan, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was there propagating revolution, and Mr. Lu joined immediately. He played a significant role in the establishment of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). He then went to Honolulu to promote the revolution, initially taking charge of the editorial department of the Hua Xing Daily. He was arrested because he was hated by the Qing government's consul in Honolulu. Later, he took over the Freedom New Paper and the Da Sheng Bao, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen ordered him to be in charge of the Tongmenghui affairs in Honolulu. From then on, the revolutionary atmosphere permeated the island. In the spring of 1911, he was summoned back to Hong Kong by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and again took charge of the China Daily, where he planned many revolutionary military affairs. At the beginning of the recovery, various armies harbored private interests, and he also ran around mediating. At that time, the reason why the overall situation in Guangdong Province did not collapse was entirely due to this. When the Guangdong Province established a parliament, he was elected as the speaker, and then elected as a provisional senator. After his term, he was elected as a overseas Chinese senator. When the Hongxian incident occurred, the Southwest raised troops. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen and wise and talented people from home and abroad gathered at sea, and he participated in every major plan, making many plans. Later, he went south to uphold the constitution. On the day the National Assembly restored the legal orthodoxy, he was appointed as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, but he refused to accept the position, and only then did he take office. In 1924, he served as the Director of the Puxin Railway. In 1926, he served as the Minister of Justice. A month later, the March 18th Massacre occurred. Because he was restricted by the situation and unable to punish the traitors, he resigned from his position. Since then, he lamented that the times were getting worse and his hopes were getting further away. Therefore, he closed his doors and wrote, hoping to transform social psychology and make humanity progress together on the road to prosperity. His published works include "The Principle of Non-Thoroughness" and "The Meaning of Non-Thoroughness," both of which were reprinted three times in two years. A Japanese scholar wrote to discuss translation to provide for his compatriots. A French scholar praised it as the "Theory of Relativity" of social science. Mr. Lu sold these books only to recover the printing costs. Because he was unable to reprint them, he transferred the copyright to the Commercial Press without taking any value, only attaching the condition of low-price sales, with the intention of contributing to society. In addition, he also wrote books such as "Humanitarian Rule of Law" and "Political Parties," which were printed and distributed widely in his early years. In the months before his death, he still worked hard to write a book called "The Origin of the Dao," but unfortunately, he died before it was completed. Mr. Lu valued education all his life. He established a free school in his hometown of Nanpan Village. In Beiping, he donated funds to establish Lida Middle School. He also often subsidized the tuition fees of poor relatives and friends, and six people have been able to complete their studies. Two people are still relying on his subsidies to study. Even in recent years, when he could only rely on pawns to make a living, he still continued to take on this responsibility. He also often gave medical aid to the poor and sick. All those who had contact with him knew this.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Orders Suspension of Toll Collection on Xiangzhen Highway</h3>
<p>Rental cars are now allowed to travel to Nanxiang</p>
<p>Tolls already collected must be publicly announced and refunded</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Rental Car Association previously reported that members, including the Xiang Sheng Zhen Ru and other car companies, were illegally charged tolls on the Xiangzhen Highway in Jiading County when driving to Nanxiang. The association believed this violated the temporary regulations on inter-provincial and inter-city car traffic and submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Construction Department. The reply, No. 389, stated: "The submitted documents are noted. The case of the Xiangzhen Highway collecting tolls has been ordered by this department to be stopped by Jiading County as soon as possible, and all tolls already collected should be publicly announced and refunded. You are hereby notified." The document is on file.</p>
<h3>Dispute over the Removal of Vegetable Stalls in Zhabei, Shops Reopened Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Various groups in Zhabei held an emergency meeting yesterday</p>
<p>Resolved to petition the municipal government to severely punish the murderers</p>
<p>The Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau was ordered to remove vegetable stalls on Jingjiang Road, which led to opposition from the stallholders, causing disturbances and resulting in a shopkeepers' strike. Yesterday morning, after the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to persuade them, all shops reopened. Various groups in Zhabei held a special emergency meeting on this matter, demanding that the municipal government severely punish the murderers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shops Reopen: Shops along Gonghe Xin Road went on strike in solidarity to protest the Fourth District Police Department's removal of stalls, which caused disturbances and aroused public indignation. Yesterday morning, after personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau went door-to-door to persuade them, all shops opened at 7:00 am and resumed business as usual.</p>
<p>Vegetable Vendors Petition: More than 100 vegetable vendors from Jingjiang Road went to the Zhabei Charity Group around 9:00 am yesterday to petition Director Wang Binyan. Mr. Wang personally received them. The vendors first reported the circumstances of the dispute, also requesting that justice be upheld. Mr. Wang agreed to forward the petition to the municipal government, requesting severe punishment of the murderers and proper handling of the aftermath to appease the people.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: Various public groups in Zhabei held a special emergency meeting regarding the Jingjiang Road vegetable stall dispute at the Sixth District Party Headquarters at 5:00 pm yesterday. More than 70 people attended, including Cheng Xiechun of the Jianghuai Association, Fan Caicong of the Postal Workers Union, Jiang Zhongliang of the War Zone Industry and Commerce Federation, Mao Xinhui and Fan Yifeng of the Shanghai Northern Chinese Goods Exhibition, and Cai Qiaojun and Xu You of the Hua Merchant Automobile Union. First, Chairman Cheng Xiechun reported the details of the Jingjiang Road dispute. The resolutions were as follows: (1) Change the method of small vegetable markets, reducing the area to 1,000 square feet, and petitioning the municipal government; (2) Withdraw the machine gun team; (3) Request that Director Wen of the Bureau replace District Chief Lai; (4) Appoint She Ximin, Liu Yuanqiu, Jiang Zhongliang, Cheng Xiechun, and Cai Qiaojun as petition representatives.</p>
<p>Police Statement: According to the person in charge of the Fourth District Police Department, the stalls along Jingjiang Road obstructed the view, so they were ordered by the Public Security Bureau to be removed. However, the stallholders dared to gather and resist, and destroyed the police station, which was illegal. The leaders have been arrested and sent to the General Bureau for review. In short, the removal of vegetable stalls by this department is a matter of local administration and will not be stopped due to opposition.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Notice on Dentist Denture Replacement Licensing</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's announcement on the renewal of licenses for dentists, denture doctors, and denture technicians: It has been found that the dentists, denture doctors, and denture technicians registered in the first, second, third, and fourth sessions of the bureau have been registered for a long time, and the locations of their practices have changed greatly, and the registration certificates have been damaged, which hinders the examination and appearance. In order to rectify this situation, the bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government for approval to uniformly reissue the registration certificates for dentists, denture doctors, and denture technicians registered in the first session (1928), the second session (1929), the third session (1930), and the fourth session (1931). All renewal fees, except for stamp taxes, will be charged according to the regulations. The license fee for dentists and denture doctors will be reduced by half according to regulations, and the fee for dentures will be charged at one-third. The renewal period is set from April 2 to 20. In addition to separate notices, a further announcement is made to all registered dentists, denture doctors, and denture technicians to comply with the regulations and come to the bureau for renewal on time. Expired old certificates will be invalid. Please do not delay. The renewal procedures are to submit the old certificate and two 4-inch half-length photos of the person, along with the renewal fee (3 yuan for dentists and denture doctors, 1 yuan for stamp tax; 1 yuan for denture certificate, 1 yuan for stamp tax) to the bureau and receive a formal receipt. One week later, the new certificate can be collected from the bureau with the receipt.</p>
<h3>Nona Living Buddha Departs for Guangdong This Morning</h3>
<p>In the spring of last year, the Guangdong military, political, academic, commercial, and labor circles jointly initiated the organization of the Guangdong Disaster Relief and Benefit People Dharma Assembly, and invited Nona Living Buddha to come to Guangdong to practice Dharma. Representatives Li Jing'an and Liang Shaodong were sent to Beijing to welcome him. It has been several months. It is now heard that Nona Living Buddha has given his permission. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai by night train with 17 attendants and secretaries, including Secretary-General Li Gongdu and Cao Yabo. The representatives, believing that the hotels in Shanghai were too noisy, specially booked the New Asia Hotel, which was recently opened and is known for its cleanliness and tranquility, as the place to receive them. In recent days, disciples Duan Hefei, Fang Shengtao, Zhao Hengyang, and Zhu Qinglan have held banquets to bid farewell. It is heard that Nona Living Buddha and others are scheduled to depart this morning on the Japanese Empress ship. Many people will see them off.</p>
<h3>Tourist Train to Hangzhou Departs Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Bans Banks from Issuing Gift Certificates</h3>
<p>Banking sector has not yet received the order</p>
<p>And claims that the number of issues is not high</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, some major banks in the city have issued a large number of gift certificates. The Ministry of Finance believes that the issuance and circulation of such gift certificates in the market are no different from banknotes. However, the issuance of banknotes requires a 60% cash reserve, while these gift certificates have no cash reserve. It does not seem to be in line with reason or law, so it is planned to ban them. Yesterday morning, when reporters inquired with the banking sector about the Ministry of Finance's ban on banks issuing gift certificates, they were told that they had only seen telegrams from Beijing stating that the banking sector had not yet received the order. It was also said that although there are no accurate statistics on the number of gift certificates issued by various banks in Shanghai, the number is not large, and the banks are confident that they can act as guarantors.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Red Pill Operation Cracked in a Japanese Residence on Wusong Road</h3>
<p>Woman Took the Opportunity to Throw the Key into the Toilet</p>
<p>Detective Discovered It and Ordered Her to Take It Out to Open the Cabinet</p>
<p>Three Large Cans and Nine Large Bags of Red Pills Confiscated</p>
<p>Man and Woman, Yang Tuxiang and Wang Liding, Arrested</p>
<p>Zheng Huali, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, learned that someone was organizing a large-scale red pill manufacturing operation in a three-story Western-style house at No. 17, Nanchang'an Lane, Wusong Road, selling them in various ports inside and outside the city for huge profits. He reported this to Western Detective-in-Charge Bapu. At 3:45 pm the day before yesterday, they secretly went to investigate the address. They saw that the lower floor was occupied by Japanese people, which hindered the investigation. They rushed to the Japanese Consulate to notify them, accompanied by Japanese Detective Nagoka Kwai, and with a search warrant, went straight to the third floor. They arrested a woman from Fenghua, Yang Tuxiang. Unexpectedly, the woman took the opportunity to throw a key into the toilet. Detective Zheng Huali noticed it and ordered her to take it out and wash it. After questioning, he learned that a large number of red pills were hidden in the cabinets. They were opened together and seized. Three large cans and nine large bags of red pills were seized, weighing 53 pounds. Melons and a bag of white powder, weighing more than 10 pounds, were seized. After a while, Wang Liding from Ningbo arrived and was also arrested. Together with the equipment for manufacturing red pills, they were taken to the Hongkou Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, recounted the incident and said that when the detectives made the arrest, they found that many of the organization's employees had escaped through the roof skylight. The house was rented by the second landlord, surnamed Shi, who stated that it was rented by the defendant Wang Liding. The case should be postponed for detailed investigation. A portion of the red pills was presented for inspection. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Wu Zihan ordered that they be remanded in custody and the case be reviewed again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Japanese Women Abandoning Homes One After Another</h3>
<p>Passionately in Love with Shanghai and Unwilling to Return</p>
<p>Some Become Waitresses, Others Become Dancers</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Japanese Consulate Police Station receives daily search reports from Japan regarding daughters who have fled, abandoning their homes. The staff of the consulate are busy dealing with these cases. For example, the daughter of Mr. Hamasaki Fujiji from Kumamoto Prefecture, Miss Yamakawa Sonome, works as a waitress at the Haininghai Coffee Shop in the city. Her mother is seriously ill and has repeatedly urged her to return, but she ignores it. The daughter of Nishimura Katsuyuki from Kurume City, Yukie, went to Manchuria six years ago and is now living at the Golden Eagle Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road, also disregarding her family. The daughter of Sato Take from Nagasaki City has not had any contact with her family since coming to Shanghai. These women are mostly tempted by others and have no intention of returning home. They are forced to ask the consulate police to search for them and persuade them.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Military Officers to Swindle and Deceive</h3>
<p>Selling Official Positions, Issuing Warrants, and Committing All Kinds of Evils</p>
<p>Yao Xijun and Six Others Transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Yao Xijun, from Songjiang, is 34 years old this year. He used to work in the military, but recently he has been unemployed in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he impersonated the commander of the 57th Division of the 39th Army and rented a room in a lawyer's office at No. 105 Crow Road (now Songshan Road) in the French Concession. He lavishly set up a National Revolutionary Army 57th Division Army Office. The scene was grand, and the equipment used was also luxurious. He went outside to swindle and deceive, selling official positions and issuing warrants indiscriminately. He hired several accomplices to work in the organization and had issued dozens of warrants. He has now been detected by Yang Qi and Xu Pengfei, supervisors of the investigation team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Yao was recently contacting someone to appoint a brigade commander, priced at 2,000 yuan. They agreed to meet at Room 9 of the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road the day before yesterday morning to deliver the warrant and money. They reported to Commander Wu Tiecheng of the Garrison Headquarters, who immediately rushed to the Yuegong Hotel, arrested Yao, and seized fake warrants, seals, official documents, letters, etc. He was taken back to the headquarters. According to Yao's confession, he used to work under Liu Heding. He was ordered to be detained. Commander Wu prepared a document at 5:00 pm and sent the two supervisors, Yang and Xu, to the political department of the French Concession Police to request assistance in arresting the accomplices. Xi Neng (transliteration), the director of the investigation team, led Chinese and Western detectives to No. 105 Crow Road, and arrested Yao's accomplices, Gong Lusun (37 years old, from Suzhou, living at No. 1 Jiaping Lane, Bai'er Road, French Concession), Peng Yingjun (31 years old, from Tongcheng, Anhui, living at No. 7 Qianjiatang, French Concession), Bao Yeqing (46 years old, from Nanjing, living at No. 9 Mingde Lane, Malang Road, French Concession), Ye Yinquan (37 years old, from Huai'an, Jiangsu, living at No. 88 Huaqi Lane, Yangshupu), Liang Yingyan (37 years old, from Nanjing), and Zhao Yongquan (24 years old, from Nanjing. Liang and Zhao both lived in the organization). They seized a seal of the 57th Division Headquarters, a small seal of the division commander, a seal of the supervisor Zhao Yiwen, a seal of the proofreader Xu Mingquan, 138 silver badges, more than 10 copies of warrants, instructions, orders, dispatches, delivery documents, postal and telecommunications books, a table of the 22nd New Army formation of the Central Army of the National Revolutionary Army, and a large number of blank warrants, instructions, letterheads, envelopes, and other items, as well as a military cap and a belt. They were all taken to the police station for temporary detention and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. Judge Xu Shenjie ascended the seat for interrogation. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police station, stated the case, saying that the case was reported by members of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to the police department for assistance in arresting the defendants. If the court approves the transfer, the police department will not object. However, since the organization was located in the French Concession and the defendants were arrested for a short time, the police department has not yet investigated whether the defendants have committed other crimes in the concession. It is best to request a shorter period for detailed investigation. Please ask the court to decide. He also presented the seized evidence. Then, Yang Fengqi, a member of the Garrison Headquarters, submitted an official document, stating the process of arresting the main criminal Yao Xijun and the defendants in the case, requesting approval to transfer them for interrogation. After reviewing the report, the court questioned the defendants one by one and decided on the spot that the case was an assistance case, and there was no need to postpone it. The defendants were allowed to be transferred to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Pirates Who Robbed the Yisheng Ship Still Have a Group in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Attempting to Continue to Rob Other Ships</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Shipping Industry is on High Alert</p>
<p>The Yisheng ship of the British Jardine Matheson and Company, which was robbed off the coast of Fuzhou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and berthed at No. 2 He Tong. It will load cargo and depart as usual today. According to reliable news yesterday, the pirates said during the robbery that there was still a group of bandits left in Shanghai, intending to rob other ships. Although this cannot be fully believed, we must be vigilant. Therefore, we continue to record it, so that the shipping industry will pay serious attention.</p>
<h3>Pirates Have Been Staying in Shanghai for a Long Time</h3>
<p>The pirates who robbed the Yisheng ship this time numbered 21 in total. The ringleader was over 30 years old and wore a Zhongshan suit. According to the pirates, they told the crew that they had come to Shanghai from Hong Kong at the beginning of the twelfth lunar month. At that time, the ringleader brought more than 5,000 yuan for travel expenses, so they first stayed at the Dongya Hotel, intending to rob a merchant ship in the short term and obtain tens of thousands of yuan in cash. However, because there was no such opportunity, they stayed in Shanghai for a long time and their travel expenses were exhausted, so they moved to the Central Hotel, and finally moved to a small inn where each person paid 30 cents a day. They exhausted their resources, pawned their clothes, and showed a stack of pawn tickets, the smallest of which had only a few silver coins. They decided to rob the Yisheng ship on the 11th.</p>
<h3>First Planned to Rob the Shuntian</h3>
<p>According to the bandits, they were from Huizhou and usually specialized in looting. Their purpose in coming to Shanghai was not [illegible] the Yisheng. Because the Zhaoshang ship Puan [illegible] had been robbed, they decided to rob the Taikoo Northern Shipping Regular Ship Shuntian [illegible] because the ship often carried cash and many passengers were wealthy. Therefore, before the Shuntian ship arrived in Shanghai, the ringleader and others had boarded the ship several times to inspect it. They saw that the anti-theft facilities in the ship were very strict and there were iron fences, etc., which made it difficult to control the entire ship. Therefore, they had boarded the ship twice but retreated. They had no choice but to rob the Yisheng ship, which had no security equipment.</p>
<h3>霞飛路葆仁里慘劇殺害青年縱火滅跡P] 死者經查明確爲留英學季陳忠信 殺害以後將屍身包裹澆火油焚燒</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1 p.m., a tragic incident occurred at a Russian residence located at 697 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, in which a young Chinese man was murdered. The assailant then wrapped the body in clothing and bedding, doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire in an attempt to destroy the evidence. The firemen who arrived at the scene discovered the body during their inspection and immediately reported it to the detective division. Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to investigate, and by evening, the deceased's identity was confirmed. The police are actively pursuing the suspect, and the detailed investigation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Recruiting Tenants</p>
<p>The property located at 697 Avenue Joffre, known as the new Bo Ren Li neighborhood, specifically number 28, is a three-story Western-style house. The sub-landlord is a Russian, whose employer is away from home. Only his wife and a male cook from Anhui Province named Chen Lishi (25 years old) remained. They posted an advertisement to rent out the vacant rooms, seeking three tenants.</p>
<p>Young Men Rent the House</p>
<p>After the Russian posted the advertisement, three young Chinese men, around 20 years old and dressed in Western suits, arrived on the morning of the 24th. One of them, speaking with a Beijing accent, told the Russian woman that they wanted to rent the entire second floor. After agreeing on the terms, they paid the rent immediately, but only one of them moved in. His luggage was quite simple. Until yesterday, for the past three days, only the two men who initially came with him visited occasionally to chat. No one else was seen coming or going.</p>
<p>A Sudden Fire Alarm</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the young tenant on the second floor went out alone. Around noon, the young man returned with two other young men, one of whom was wearing a Western suit and had never been seen before. After the three men entered the room, the door was closed. The Russian woman vaguely heard laughter and conversation coming from the room. Unexpectedly, at 1:15 p.m., a fire broke out on the second floor. The fire brigade of the French Concession responded to the alarm and quickly extinguished the blaze. A charred corpse was then discovered.</p>
<p>A Ghastly Corpse</p>
<p>After the fire was put out, the firemen, following routine, went inside to clear the debris. Upon entering the room, they discovered a pile of old clothes and messy bedding in the western corner. The room was filled with thick smoke and the strong odor of kerosene. When they pulled away the pile of clothing, they were horrified to find a corpse. The deceased appeared to be in his twenties, wearing a Western suit, and was undoubtedly Chinese. His head was covered in blood, as if he had been struck in the head with a hammer. The body was then wrapped in clothing and bedding, doused with kerosene, and set on fire in an attempt to destroy the evidence. His head and face were charred beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Confirming the Truth</p>
<p>The detectives, having finished their investigation, went to 27 Beijing Road to inquire. They were told that there was indeed a Chen Zhongxin residing there and that Chen currently lived at 2 Feng Wu Li, Lu Ban Road, in the French Concession. The detectives rushed to Feng Wu Li to follow up. The sub-landlord, a Suzhou native named Wang Jinhua, said that a young man from Guangdong, claiming to be Chen Zhongxin, 26 years old, had rented a room on the second floor ten months ago at a monthly rent of 28 yuan. He usually kept to himself and seemed quite honest.</p>
<p>Strictly Arresting the Suspects</p>
<p>Around 10 a.m. today (yesterday), two young men, one in Western suit and one in Chinese suit, visited Chen at home. After a brief conversation, the three left together and have not returned. When the detectives described the deceased's appearance and clothing, Wang confirmed that it was indeed Chen. Wang also told the detectives that the deceased had been robbed of 4,000 yuan last year. After investigating, the detectives returned to the police station to report. They also notified the Tong Ren Fu Yuan branch to send officers to take the body to the morgue for examination, pending a request for an autopsy by the Second Special Court. At the same time, they are strictly arresting the suspects to bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Eight Percent Discount on Water Rates; Actual Increase of Two and a Half Times</p>
<p>This year, water rate disputes are expected to increase.</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company signed a water rate contract with the Public Works Department, which expired at the end of March this year. The water rates for this year, after discussions by the Water Rate Review Committee and the Public Works Department, were reduced to 80% of the original rate, effective from April 1st for a period of one year, as reported in previous newspapers.</p>
<p>A reporter inquired with relevant parties about the measures taken after the water rate reduction. According to the person in charge, the 80% water rate is, in fact, an increase of 48%. Previously, water rates were charged at 7.5% of the house rent. Later, the water company changed it to 10% of the house rent. In previous years, the company charged based on the estimated house rent, which was not fair to those who used more water. Therefore, they switched to a water meter system to control excessive use. However, after implementing the new system, wealthy houses benefited, while ordinary people suffered. Ordinary people had to share a single house among seven or eight families, while large Western-style houses were occupied by only one household, resulting in lower costs. Therefore, everyone was happy to install water meters.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the water meter system last year, the water company and the Public Works Department agreed that for every 100 yuan of water bill, only 32% was actually paid. This amount was paid in two installments: 15% for the first installment and 20% of the remaining 85 yuan for the second installment, totaling 17 yuan. Therefore, only 32 yuan was actually paid for every 100 yuan.</p>
<p>This year, with the 80% water rate, 80 yuan must be paid for every 100 yuan, a difference of 48% compared to last year. Based on last year's actual revenue, this is an increase of two and a half times. Considering the above situation, water rate disputes are expected to increase this year.</p>
<p>Passenger on Daqing Steamer Jumps into the Sea</p>
<p>Yuan Taili unable to bear the oppression.</p>
<p>Left a suicide note advising compatriots.</p>
<p>The Daqing steamer of the Da Da Steamer Company in the South City, at about 10 p.m. on the 24th of this month, was preparing to set sail from the Da Da dock at the 16th Pier to Tongzhou, when a male passenger, about 30 years old, speaking with a Zhejiang accent, wearing a gray wool coat, a copper pot hat, and black leather shoes, first purchased a first-class ticket to Tongzhou at the company's ticket office, then boarded the steamer. The ship's steward escorted him to cabin number 6. Later, the steward noticed that the passenger was sitting in the cabin with a frown, frequently sighing, but did not pay much attention.</p>
<p>That night, the steamer set sail from Shanghai. Around 5 a.m. the next morning, when the steamer reached the sea, there was drizzle and a fierce wind. Most of the passengers were asleep, but the steward saw the passenger slowly emerge from the cabin, walk to the deck, look into the distance, sigh deeply, and then jump into the sea to commit suicide. The steward saw the passenger jump into the sea and tried to save him, but the passenger was swept away by a large wave without a trace. The steward immediately went to the passenger's cabin, number 6, and found a wool hat, a pair of gloves, a large sum of cash, and a suicide note.</p>
<p>The note read: "Yuan Taili, the one who jumped into the sea, is from Da Chi County, Zhejiang. I have worked in a factory in Pudong for five years. Last year, I was forced to resign by the factory. There is no union in my factory. I could only submit to the oppression of the factory. After losing my job, I also experienced a family tragedy. Now, I cannot contribute to the country's production, (1) I cannot take care of my family, (2) I cannot secure my personal livelihood. Having endured such extreme oppression, I can only resolve it through suicide. I hope my compatriots will forgive me. I am very sorry. Finally, I hope the proletarian workers in Shanghai will work together and strive for production to save China's modern industry from crisis and solve all personal livelihood problems. The people under the capitalists, unreasonably oppress the workers. I hope my worker compatriots will focus on production on the one hand and resist on the other. In my factory, a group of young worker compatriots are now oppressed by the factory, like cattle and horses, receiving a monthly wage of 8 or 9 yuan and working for ten hours. These people are not satisfied and have a wolf's heart and dog's lungs, wanting to spend two or three hundred on entertainment."</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the steamer returned to Shanghai, the steward handed over the passenger's belongings to the company. The company's manager, Yang Guanbai, sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team to file a report.</p>
<p>Fire on East Youheng Road; Child Burned to Death</p>
<p>At 12:16 p.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at 52 Jiang Hong Li, East Youheng Road, Hongkou. The fire quickly spread through the roof, with flames reaching into the sky. The fire spread to the neighboring houses at numbers 54, 5, and 6. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire by 1:30 p.m. Three houses were burned down, and a three-year-old child was burned to death. The arsonist was arrested and sent to the police station for strict punishment by the court.</p>
<p>Ding Ganren's Descendant, Ding Jinan, Runs Over and Kills Someone; Sentenced</p>
<p>Manslaughter; Fine of 600.</p>
<p>Incidental Civil Suit Transferred to Civil Court for Trial</p>
<p>Ding Jinan, the descendant of the late famous doctor Ding Ganren, is currently 22 years old and resides at 4, Lane 1537, Jing'an Temple Road. On the evening of the 15th of this month, at 8:30 p.m., while driving car number 2064 past the entrance of the Da Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road, the driver accidentally knocked down rickshaw number 3282, pulled by rickshaw puller Qian Youfu, and ran over and killed passenger Shen Liansheng. The First Special Court examined the body and conducted an investigation. The police charged Ding with manslaughter under Article 291, Section 1 of the Criminal Code. Ding hired lawyer Gu Zhengbing to defend him in court. The court ordered Ding to pay a bail of 2,000 yuan and released him pending trial, as reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>It has now been learned that during the adjournment of the case, the police found that Yu Baoshan, who resides at 457 Zhoujiazui Road and owns a machine factory, was also at fault and should be held responsible. It was reported that Yu was riding a motorized bicycle number 836 to watch a movie at the Da Guangming Theater, traveling east on Jing'an Temple Road. Upon reaching his destination, Yu suddenly turned north. Ding Jinan's car was behind Yu's car and, in an attempt to avoid Yu's car, crashed into the rickshaw in the opposite direction. According to the Public Works Department's vehicle regulations, cars traveling on Nanjing Road are not allowed to overtake vehicles in front of them. Furthermore, since Da Guangming is a movie theater, all vehicles traveling east are not allowed to stop on the north side of the road. Yu Baoshan suddenly turned north without signaling, causing the car behind him to crash into the rickshaw. Therefore, Yu's responsibility is undeniable.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the continued trial yesterday morning, the police brought Yu Baoshan to the Eighth Criminal Court and listed him as the second defendant. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated the aforementioned facts and charged Yu with manslaughter under Article 291, Section 1 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>The lawyer representing the victim, Shen Liansheng's family, stated that the court had previously ordered the defendant, Ding Jinan, to settle the losses out of court. However, until yesterday, Ding only came with his lawyer and offered to pay 1,500 or 2,000 yuan for funeral expenses. The victim's family requested a pension of 300 yuan per year for 20 years, totaling 6,000 yuan, which was not excessive. However, the defendant only agreed to pay one-third of that amount, which was too far apart, and therefore, no agreement could be reached.</p>
<p>Ding Jinan claimed that he caused the accident because he was trying to avoid Yu Baoshan. Yu claimed that Ding's car was driving too fast and that he was unable to stop in time, and that he was not responsible.</p>
<p>After rickshaw puller Qian Youfu testified, the lawyers for both sides began their arguments. Judge Wu Tingqi ruled that Ding Jinan was guilty of manslaughter and fined him 600 yuan. Yu Baoshan was found not guilty. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.</p>

<p>Pig Bristle Factory Workers Oppose the Sale of White Bristle Raw Materials to Japan</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party and Government to Stop It</p>
<p>All the workers of the Pig Bristle Association and other organizations are petitioning the Party and government to demand a stop to the practice of factories selling white pig bristle raw materials to the Japanese, which is causing workers to lose their jobs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Materials Sold to Japan</p>
<p>Pig bristle businesses, such as Heng Shun Tai and the Pig Bristle Association, deal in two types of raw materials: black bristles and white bristles. Black bristles are used to make paintbrushes, while white bristles are used to make toothbrushes. The finished products are sold widely overseas, including in Europe, America, and Japan. Since last year, Japanese merchants have found that the finished products are more expensive, so they have switched to buying white bristle raw materials and manufacturing them in Japan themselves. Pig bristle factories, such as the Pig Bristle Association, are all reselling white bristle raw materials to the Japanese, causing the price of raw materials to skyrocket. At the same time, all the factories are experiencing a shortage of raw materials and are suspending operations.</p>
<p>Workers Oppose</p>
<p>The Pig Bristle Workers' Union received reports from the workers of various factories that last year, due to the impact of the factories reselling white bristles to the Japanese, all the factories suffered from a shortage of raw materials, and there was no work to do, which greatly affected the workers' livelihoods. This year, the factories have resumed operations one after another, but the factories are still greedy for small profits and are reselling the raw materials they have collected to the Japanese. In the future, a lack of raw materials will inevitably occur again, just like last year. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., they sent representatives, Wei Dongshan and 20 others, to the Municipal Party Department's Bureau of Social Affairs to petition, demanding that the factories be stopped from selling raw materials to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Shanghai North District Fire Brigade Yesterday Requests Relief Funds</p>
<p>The fire-fighting funds for the fire brigades in Zhabei, Hujiaqiao, Hongzhen, Jiangwan, Zhenru, and other districts, since being allocated monthly by the municipal government through the Public Security Bureau after the Shanghai War, have been paid no later than the 11th of the following month. Recently, due to the fact that the funds for February of this year have not been received, the wages of hired laborers, rent, gasoline, food, and other expenses have been overdue and cannot be delayed any longer. Creditors are pressing for payment, and the current situation is extremely difficult and unsustainable. The fire brigades believe that fire-fighting funds are related to the lives and property of local citizens and are no less important than police salaries. Especially after the war, the economy is depressed, and business is declining, which is very different from the past. There is no way to raise funds. The hired laborers have exhausted their resources due to the lack of wages. Yesterday, the various brigades held a meeting and drove more than ten fire engines to the municipal government to petition, and they were received by Staff Sun and accepted. He immediately telegraphed the Public Security and Finance Bureaus, promising to approve half of the funds first to maintain the current situation.</p>
<p>Huasheng Electric Factory Actively Participates in the National Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Huasheng Electric Appliance Manufacturing Factory in this city was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China and has been around for eighteen years. Its various products are sold at home and abroad, as far as the Philippines, India, and the South Seas. In China, there is almost no city or town where Huasheng factory products are not installed in electric light factories or shops and residences. Since the beginning of spring, the weather has gradually warmed up, and various sectors have sent letters inquiring about the styles and prices of the factory's various fan products this year, so as to make advance orders. It is heard that in addition to answering in detail, the factory has recently shipped all its products to various places for exhibition and display, so that people from all walks of life can appreciate them. Recently, at the invitation of the Hangzhou City National Goods Exhibition and the Shanghai North National Goods Exhibition in this city, the factory actively participated in both to provide the Chinese people with a view.</p>
<p>Two People Died Unnaturally</p>
<p>Fell to His Death</p>
<p>Zhu Fangjiu, a native of Siyang, 46 years old, lived at 27 Deyuan Li, Yangshupu, and was a foreman in the boiler room of the Electric Power Company. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 p.m., he accidentally fell from the second floor while working, and his brains burst open instantly, rendering him unconscious.

<p>Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the American International Assurance Company</p>
<p>The American International Assurance Company held its 13th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders at the company at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday (26th). The attendees included General Manager Fei Mengfu, Directors Bei Zuyi, Steven N.V. Siarr, Raymond Seitz, and other shareholders (representing 34,906 shares). Fei Mengfu gave the following speech:</p>
<p>"Judging from all aspects, the company's operations in 1933 have made significant progress. The amount of effective insurance, reserves, and new business have all increased, and the mortality rate of policyholders and the lapse rate of insurance have decreased. The total amount of new business reached 14,705,529 yuan, the amount of effective insurance reached 51,628,415 yuan, and the operating profit was 403,964 yuan and 22 cents. In addition, the profit from exchange was 88,697 yuan and 88 cents. The profit for 1933 was 492,661 yuan and 90 cents, which, together with the previous profit of 188,706 yuan and 40 cents, totaled 681,368 yuan and 30 cents. After deducting the policyholder dividend of 151,206 yuan and 18 cents and the shareholder dividend, the net profit was 530,162 yuan and 12 cents. The total amount of cash reached 685,471 yuan and 33 cents. The company's various investments are very solid. The amount of bond purchases reached 1,526,052 yuan and 12 cents (mostly trust bonds and French and British government bonds). Real estate mortgage loans reached 693,059 yuan and 76 cents, and policy loans reached 869,632 yuan and 9 cents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, life insurance in China is still in its infancy, and educational work should be actively carried out. In 1932-33, the company, based on this principle, joined other companies to establish the China Life Insurance Promotion Association. The association is an independent organization whose purpose is to promote the true meaning of life insurance. The results achieved are already somewhat describable, such as publishing articles in various well-known magazines in the country from time to time, selecting staff to give lectures at various universities, publishing life insurance journals and quarterly magazines, and compiling life insurance teaching materials. All of this educational work is still being carried out tirelessly."</p>
<p>After Fei Mengfu finished his speech, several proposals were passed, and Fei Mengfu, Bei Zuyi, Raymond Seitz, Steven N.V. Starr, Shi Kelei, and others were elected as directors.</p>

<p>City Voices</p>
<p>National Goods Rubber Adhesive Plaster</p>
<p>In recent years, our people have been working hard to promote national goods. Medical products have also been imitated, but rubber adhesive plaster is the only item that is not a national product, which is a huge loss. A Shanghai merchant, in view of this, specially hired a chemical tax technician to research for more than two years before finally succeeding. He raised funds to set up a factory on Hugunjing Road in the South City. It is heard that a large number of products have been supplied to the world and have been tested by major doctors in major hospitals in Shanghai and are considered qualified. Its low price and excellent quality can resist imported products. It is also heard that it has been approved by the government authorities for patent registration.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Big and Small Swindles by Deng Dangshi</p>
<p>The scandals in the "literary world" have been exposed quite a bit in the past two years: cutting and pasting, blatant plagiarism, profiteering, and fake endorsements. However, there are still many questionable things that we have grown accustomed to and no longer pay attention to.</p>
<p>Celebrities' signatures, even if the handwriting isn't necessarily good, only indicate that the author or publisher of the book knows the celebrity, and have no connection with the content, so they can't be considered deceptive. What's questionable is "proofreading." The role of proofreader is naturally a celebrity, scholar, or professor. However, these gentlemen themselves often don't have any works related to the subject matter. So, whether they actually proofread is one question, and even if they do, whether the proofreading is truly reliable is another question. But we rarely see articles that further proofread and offer criticism.</p>
<p>Another type is "editing." These "editors" are also mostly celebrities, and this name makes readers feel the book is reliable. But this is also very questionable. If the book has some prefaces or afterwords, we can still determine from the text and ideas whether it was truly edited by the celebrity. However, books displayed in the market often open directly to the table of contents, leaving you completely clueless. How can this be trustworthy? As for the so-called "chief editors" of large-scale publications in various fields, it's as if these celebrities are omniscient, understanding everything from the sky to the earth, "doing nothing and yet accomplishing everything," which makes it unnecessary for us to speculate further.</p>
<p>There is also the "special contributor." When a publication is first launched, the advertisements often list a large number of celebrity special contributors, sometimes even with embossed prints of the authors' handwritten signatures to show their authenticity. This isn't necessarily questionable. However, after a year or so, flaws gradually appear, and many of the so-called special contributors never have their work published. Whether it's because they weren't actually commissioned or they were commissioned but didn't deliver, we have no way of knowing. But it's evident that those so-called handwritten signatures may have been clipped from somewhere else, or simply fabricated. If they were taken from submissions, why do we see the signature but not the manuscript?</p>
<p>These celebrities are selling their "names." I wonder if they are receiving "empty salaries"? If they are, then naturally they are willingly selling themselves. Otherwise, it could be said that their names are being "stolen for sale." There are those who "deceive the world to steal fame," and there are those who steal fame to deceive the public. The ways of the world are truly diverse. However, the only ones who suffer losses are the readers.</p>
<p>Horse Thieves by Wu Yan</p>
<p>丨One of the Mountain Night Songs丨</p>
<p>Following the mountain road illuminated by moonlight, Lao Dong and Xiao Long rode their sweat-soaked horses and went downhill. The valley was filled with a bluish-white night mist, but some dark, towering treetops also emerged. In places unseen beneath their feet, mountain springs murmured softly. The scent of mugwort and the dampness of the soil gradually intensified. Not far away, the sound of a dog suddenly barking could be heard, and thatched huts surrounded by a low fence were exposed in the mist mixed with moonlight, revealing their blue shadows.</p>
<p>The two dismounted beside the fence. A dog the color of a horse rushed over, barking loudly, but stopped immediately when Lao Dong scolded it, only wagging its tail.</p>
<p>"Haha, even the dog is so familiar with you. You still say you don't come here often!"</p>
<p>Xiao Long loosened the saddle while smiling meaningfully at his companion. Lao Dong didn't answer, only fumbled with the bag tied to the horse's back. Xiao Long changed the subject, saying to himself:</p>
<p>"Hmm, is it the scent of citrus flowers? (Sniffing his nose) It smells so good!"</p>
<p>Then, he turned his head and looked around. Nearby were low trees with uneven shadows, but in the distance lay a faint bluish-white mist.</p>
<p>Lao Dong, carrying a bag full of things, walked to the house and knocked on the door. The dog circled at his feet, rubbing its back affectionately against his legs. After knocking for a while, a small window in the thatched hut lit up, and a lemon-colored light shone out, as if a huge wild beast sleeping soundly in the mountains suddenly woke up and opened one eye.</p>
<p>Xiao Long saw the door open, and at the same time, a low, murmuring complaint also came out, belonging to a young woman. It seemed that after receiving the bag, the voice suddenly turned gentle and burst into childlike laughter, but what exactly she was saying was still unclear. Lao Dong didn't go inside, and soon turned around and came back. The woman suddenly let out a loud, complaining, coquettish voice:</p>
<p>"You only come in the middle of the night, and leave again after coming. How annoying!... You're not allowed to come again in the future."</p>
<p>"If I'm not allowed to come, then I won't come!"</p>
<p>Lao Dong laughed loudly. Then, he jumped onto his horse, nodding slightly to Xiao Long.</p>
<p>"Let's go, friend!"</p>
<p>Xiao Long also jumped onto his own horse, smiling as he said:</p>
<p>"It's not bad being with you, it's just..."</p>
<p>"Just what?"</p>
<p>Lao Dong immediately turned his head and asked, acting very serious.</p>
<p>"It's just that you're a bit too impressive."</p>
<p>Xiao Long laughed softly. His companion didn't answer, only squeezed the horse with his legs and whipped it at the same time, speeding off into the shadows of the trees on the path, disappearing into the mist in an instant. The barking of dogs from other places echoed continuously in the distance. Xiao Long quickly caught up. The moist night wind brushed against his forehead, and occasionally mist droplets from the trees splashed on his brow. Ahead, a majestic singing voice swayed in the mist:</p>
<p>"Say it's absurd, then it's absurd. We don't pay taxes or deliver grain. If we meet an official, we'll slap him in the face."</p>
<p>Xiao Long's throat immediately tickled, and he joined in, singing:</p>
<p>"Haha, everywhere is our paradise! Haha, everywhere is our hometown!"</p>
<p>He caught up on the hillside, and the voices of the two singing together rose up.</p>
<p>"Listen, the camel bells! Our harvest is in the faintly lit morning."</p>
<p>Haha, everywhere is our paradise! Haha, everywhere is our hometown!</p>
<p>Returning Home by Lu Fei, a Hubei Folk Song</p>
<p>Dad hears that his daughter is coming,</p>
<p>He picks up a shopping basket and goes to the market.</p>
<p>Mom hears that her daughter is coming,</p>
<p>She laughs and happily welcomes her out.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law sees that the girl is coming,</p>
<p>She brings in a pot of hot tea,</p>
<p>And takes out a pot of cold tea.</p>
<p>A bowl of fish, scales not removed;</p>
<p>A bowl of meat, dripping with blood;</p>
<p>A bowl of amaranth, roots not trimmed.</p>
<p>The brother says, "Let the sister stay home and rest."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law says, "The bed is short and the blanket is narrow,</p>
<p>Where should the little sister-in-law rest?"</p>
<p>The brother says, "There's a straw mat in the garden behind."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law says, "The straw mat is for catching winter melons."</p>
<p>The brother says, "The winter melons are already harvested."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law says, "The winter melons are just blossoming."</p>
<p>Going Home by Wei Jinzhi</p>
<p>I'm going home because I was moved by something.</p>
<p>When my younger sister first wrote to me, inviting me to go home together at the end of the year, I didn't agree. I replied, "I'm not going back. I have my own career and aspirations." The so-called career and aspirations were just nice-sounding terms. In reality, I had a kind of foolish attachment, and also a kind of illness, a habit of not wanting to move once I settled down, so I refused.</p>
<p>The second time, she actually didn't notify me and came all the way from Shanghai to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Although she is our youngest sister, she has already reached the age of marriage. However, I always treated her like a child, and my conversations with her often carried a tone of gentle pity and slight mockery. So I started by saying:</p>
<p>"Little one, little ones always miss home and want to go home to eat some New Year's treats."</p>
<p>Saying this, partly I wanted to provoke a kind of childlike joy in a young person who had been working away from home since childhood, because we often used this tone to tease her at home. Partly, I lightly concealed my unwillingness to go back. This was somewhat hurtful to her self-esteem, and she retorted:</p>
<p>"Do you think I'm still a child? I'm no longer going home just for something to eat."</p>
<p>"Then why?" I asked. I had to ask.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm going back to see Dad and Mom."</p>
<p>"That's for sure. Of course, you would say you're going back to see Dad and Mom. It would be quite embarrassing to say you're just going back to eat!" I still stubbornly persisted. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Whispers by Xia Chang</p>
<p>(10) (4)</p>
<p>Talking about lyrical essays, I thought of Lu You's "Notes from the Old Learning Hut," volume one, section "Twenty-Seven Years Away from the Capital," and remembered that Chen Xilu (Yutian) had quoted this passage in his book "Idle Talks of the Yellow Granny." He said: "Lu You's Notes from the Old Learning Hut: 'After being away from the capital for twenty-seven years, I returned. Except for Zhou Chengxiang's son Zichong, all the old people were gone, even the clerks were gone. Only the fortune-teller Dongwei, a mountain man, was unharmed and not very old. Talking about the old days was heartbreaking. The monk Zhaodu from the Small Zhaodu Temple in West Lake, Liao Wen, was not yet thirty when we parted. I thought he might still be alive. Because I was ordered to inspect the suburban temple altars with the officials of the Fengchang Temple, I visited him but he had already passed away. His disciple brought out a portrait of him, which showed an old monk. Even if I saw him in person now, I wouldn't recognize him.' His description of the feeling of survival and loss is heartrending in every word. It makes me think that after not even a few decades in the old places of one's life, acquaintances are scattered and lost. Looking up and down increases sorrow. How many similar situations are there? Every time I read about it, I feel bad for several days." This can be called double lyricism. From a personal perspective, this kind of sadness is inevitably evoked. However, from the perspective of the progress of the entire society, this kind of emotion would not exist in the heart, I can assert. The so-called individual emotions and social emotions can be seen in the same way in these places.</p>
<p>'Spring Colors Annoy, Can't Sleep' a Northern Folk Song by Xueyou</p>
<p>Small patrolman,</p>

<p>Afraid of nothing,</p>
<p>Except soldiers.</p>
<p>He fawns over rickshaws,</p>

<p>The Song Festival of Guangxi by Wei Yongchao</p>
<p>The song festival is a special custom in Guangxi, and some people also call it the "flirting festival." Most people who go there are said to be "chasing the flirting festival." The so-called "festival" is not a market for buying and selling goods, but a place where many men and women pursue and meet in secret.</p>
<p>Guangxi has ninety-four counties, and in the past, all counties had this custom of song festivals. After the Republic of China, this custom gradually declined. Now, only nineteen counties still retain this custom.</p>
<p>The dates for holding the song festivals vary from county to county: some are in February or March of the lunar calendar, some are in June, and some are in August or September, but the most popular times are around the Qingming Festival and in September.</p>
<p>In the past, the meeting places were fixed, mostly in the countryside outside the village or near the foothills. Now, because the government often enforces effective bans on this matter, they have to hold them secretly, and the locations are no longer fixed. When the date of the song festival arrives, young men and women flock to their temporarily agreed-upon locations to find their lovers. Men, for the sake of preventing accidents, all carry handguns or sharp blades. Sometimes, when the county government hears the news, it orders the police to go and disperse them, and they often resist with gunfire, resulting in frequent deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>Why do they hold this kind of gathering? Is it because debauchery has become a trend, and they simply agree on a meeting time to openly pursue each other? According to their answers, this is only according to custom, and not debauchery: it is necessary to do this in order to prevent natural disasters and ensure a good harvest.</p>
<p>When they gather in the wilderness, they are not in groups of dozens like a picnic; they are only in groups of three or five. The women cover their heads with a white towel, and when the men see this sign, they know it is a woman. The men's signs are not fixed: some carry umbrellas, some carry canes, and some whistle. When the men and women meet, he or she sings mountain songs to tease each other, and then they ask each other's names. If both parties agree, then the love songs of mutual admiration are sung one after another by you and me. The man must be able to respond to the woman's song on the spot; otherwise, the woman will ignore him. After singing for a while, if he gets the woman's permission, the man can invite her to the side to talk intimately and give her some gifts—cosmetics, pastries, fresh fruits, etc. After accepting them, the woman often gives the man a hand-woven towel in return. Afterwards, they can hug, kiss, or be even more promiscuous. Here, I want to talk about the rules they all abide by: when a pair of men and women are talking in a place, other men cannot walk past them to peep—unless they are good friends. When a pair of men and women are singing back and forth to each other, other men or women cannot interrupt either of them.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that on the day of the song festival, if an unmarried girl receives a gift from a man, her parents consider it an honor when she returns home. If a married woman does not receive a gift from a man on that day, her husband will also be unhappy. The reason is that if other men don't fall in love with her, it must be because she is not beautiful enough.</p>
<p>After the song festival, the married women still diligently work in their husband's homes in an orderly manner. They clearly distinguish between their lovers and their husbands.</p>
<p>Last Will and Testament (7) by Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>The next day, she went to tell him of her satisfaction. But on the 25th, she saw that Xi Zhuoyun had sent another letter, saying that he had been to the publishing department; they said that because it was the end of the year, the economy was tighter, and they would not accept any more manuscripts this year, so they would have to wait until spring. Although he had spent a lot of time talking, there was really nothing he could do, and he could only ask her to forgive him.</p>
<p>"What?" As if distrusting herself, she read the letter again, but that was indeed what it meant. She also took out the letter from the previous two days and read it again. She didn't think she had misunderstood the meaning.</p>
<p>"This is strange!"</p>
<p>But what she was even more anxious about was whether the publication fee had also changed.</p>
<p>"Why didn't he mention a word about this matter?"</p>
<p>She went to see Xi Zhuoyun, but he wasn't in his office. One of his colleagues said that he hadn't been there that day. Leaving there, she walked towards Xi Zhuoyun's home, as if she didn't know where else to go.</p>
<p>"Have you been to my office?" When Zhuoyun saw Yina, he asked as if he had understood.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did you receive my letter?"</p>
<p>"I received it."</p>
<p>"There's really no way. I told them again and again, but they always said that they couldn't do it this year no matter what."</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that they had already agreed?"</p>
<p>"They did agree, to add two yuan per thousand words, but probably because they don't have the money now, they broke the agreement."</p>
<p>"I'm not going to talk about that now—I want to know, will there be any changes to the publication fee?"</p>
<p>"That depends on talking about it."</p>
<p>"Depends on talking about it?"</p>
<p>"If you don't talk about it, how can you decide?"</p>
<p>"It hasn't been decided yet? It hasn't been decided yet? What exactly are you saying?"</p>
<p>"Success is probably always successful, but you have to talk about it."</p>
<p>"Who are you going to talk to? Aren't you the editor?"</p>
<p>"But I'm not in charge of the money."</p>
<p>"Who are you going to talk to, exactly?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to see if the accounting department has any money."</p>
<p>"What if they don't?"</p>
<p>"Don't have any? They probably always have two hundred odd dollars."</p>
<p>Yina wanted to ask him, since he had to talk about it, or had to see, why didn't he go sooner? But then she thought, what was the use of asking? And he must have his own reasons? So she asked a more practical question.</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial Futures Silver Prices Rebound After Contraction of Margin Deposits</p>
<p>Gold Market Closed for Three Days for Spring Festival Holiday from the 30th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially showed strength due to stagnant silver prices and upward trends. However, it weakened slightly due to unfavorable news and rising silver futures in the night market. The morning session saw no significant fluctuations in overseas silver markets in both the UK and US. Although near-term silver prices at the Five Metals Exchange showed a slight increase, long-term prices fell by varying degrees ranging from 0.18 to 0.38 cents. London spot gold rose by two pence, exchange rates increased slightly, US cotton fell slightly, and US wheat prices contracted by one cent. The opening price of wool futures rose to 63 yuan, with some fluctuation thereafter, but the overall trend remained positive. Subsequently, the market weakened due to the stable HSBC exchange rate and banks selling US dollars, indicating downstream pressure. The Central Bank's interventions were initially unable to break the 60 yuan mark. Later, news from foreign sources suggested that the US Senate might pass a bill related to silver futures, coupled with reports of a sudden one-cent rise in silver prices in the Seattle night market, which caused apprehension and led to a drop below the 60 yuan level. Banks took advantage of the low prices to trade. The midday session was relatively calm. The market was stagnant, hovering around 60 yuan for a considerable time. Afterwards, banks showed increased buying interest, leading to a rebound in domestic prices. Although prices retreated slightly later, market sentiment remained stable, and the 60 yuan mark was not broken again. The market weakened at the close due to profit-taking by the Guangdong trading houses. Overall, the day's market fluctuated within a limited range. March futures also rose, exceeding the closing price, with a spread of eight jiao for deferred delivery. The price of pure gold was 974 yuan. The Central Bank intervened with 490 bars of spot gold. The day's market conditions are summarized below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 961 yuan 9 jiao, up 3 yuan 3 jiao from the previous close. Spot prices opened at 2 yuan. Exchange rates opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling 4.25 pence for British pounds and 34 yuan 56.25 fen for US dollars. Zhengjin bid 6.25 fen for US dollars for April delivery. Although Yidayong was selling, the price rose from 1 yuan 7 jiao to 2 yuan 5 jiao. Shengsheng, Dahengxing, Yuanchun, Hengchang, Yongtai and others were all buying. Huabi bid 93.75 fen for July US dollars. Anticipating stable HSBC exchange rates for both British pounds and US dollars, Tongyi, Qianchang, Xiangheng, Yuzhifeng, and Yongtai all sold, causing prices to fall. Shanghai Huabi bid 75 fen for May US dollars. Hengxing, Zhifeng, and Yongtai sold again at 59 yuan a corner, while Qianchang and Xiangshun took delivery. The situation remained in a holding pattern, but with banks selling, and the Central Bank intervening, Yingfeng, Hengxing, Qianchang, and Xiangtai all bought, but the price retreated back below 60 yuan as Wupin, Yongfeng, Hengtai, Daxing, Yongtai, and others actively sold. Later, Yongde suddenly sold, causing the price to fall to 59 yuan 1 jiao. Finally, Hengxing, Fuchang, Qianchang, Xiangtai, Shengsheng, and Daliang successively took delivery. The midday closing price was 960 yuan, with spot prices at zero 1 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 959 yuan 9 jiao, with spot prices opening at zero 1 jiao. The market was extremely calm, with little fluctuation. Qianchang, Xiangtai, Fuyu, Hengyu and others were on the buying side, while Yidayong, Hengtai, and others were selling. The market hovered around 60 yuan for a long time. Later, Maijia Li and Huabi both bid 87.5 fen for June US dollars, while Xie Kang, Zhifeng, Yongtai, Dadecheng, Qianchang, Xiangtai, Xiexing, Yongtai and others competed to buy, pushing the price up to 61 yuan 5 jiao. Sanjing Huabi offered 81.25 fen for June US dollars, while Yingfeng, Hengyu and Qingyong sold, causing prices to fall. However, Qianchang limited its purchase price, and there was still a struggle around the 1 yuan level. Afterwards, Yuqing, Yongtai, Yuanmao, Yongtai, Tianfeng, Bingxing, and Hongxing actively sold, bringing the price down to 60 yuan. Qianchang successively bought, stabilizing the market. The closing price was 960 yuan 7 jiao, with spot prices at zero 5 jiao. After the close, Hengxing aggressively sold, causing prices to fall. The highest price of the day was 962 yuan 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 959 yuan 1 jiao, a difference of 3 yuan 4 jiao. The result was a 2 yuan 1 jiao improvement from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was determined by the stable HSBC exchange rate for US dollars, remaining at 34 yuan 25 fen, resulting in a margin deposit price of 1010 yuan. Based on the closing price, the margin was approximately 49 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan from the previous close. The settlement price for the current month was determined by the stable HSBC exchange rate for shillings, remaining at 1 shilling 4.125 pence. Based on the exchange rate of 4.98605 for British pounds to US dollars, the margin deposit price was approximately 716 yuan. Based on the closing price, the price rose by less than 1 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan from the previous close. The margin for this month was recorded as 717 yuan, for April as 961 yuan, and for May as 960 yuan. The morning and afternoon water supplements were both 717 yuan. The price of pure gold was calculated as 974 yuan. Transactions on the market involved approximately 1,000 taels sold by the Tianjin trading houses to their counterparts, with a premium of 13 yuan, representing long-term contracts. In addition, there were varying levels of delivery and receipt. East China goods were traded at a premium of 12 yuan 2.5 jiao and 12 yuan 5 jiao, but transaction volumes were low. Swaps involved a discount of 8 jiao offered by Yingfeng Heng to Yuanmao for 28 bars. The Central Bank bought 490 bars of spot gold from Yingfeng Heng, Dadecheng, Taikang, Runtong, Fengyong, and others at a price of 961 yuan 5 jiao. As of today, a total of 2,261 April contracts remain unsettled, with 12 long positions and 9 short positions.</p>
<p>Market transactions were moderate overall. Shunli, Tongchun, Dadecheng, Qianchang, Xiangtai, Yuanchun, Dafa, Yongxing, Yongtai, Sida, Fuxingda, Fuxing Yong and others were on the buying side. Hengxing, Tianfeng, Hengchang, Yongtai, Hengyu, Changsheng Yong, Yongfeng, Hengxing Yuan, Hengtai, Shenkang, Yongde, Bingxing, Yuqing Yong and others were on the selling side.

The total number of contracts traded on the day was 27,748 in the morning and 12,999 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The margin deposit for March futures opened in the morning at 718 yuan 5 jiao, up 3 yuan 7 jiao from the previous close. This price was higher than the settlement price, reflecting profit-taking by outside traders. Shunli sold 7 contracts from Wanxing, bringing the price to 8 yuan 5 jiao. However, there was a strong selling interest at this price, so the situation weakened after entry. Later, Yuanheng sold 21 contracts to Shunli, pushing the price down to 8 yuan. Wanxing sold a total of 119 contracts to Shunli, dropping the price to 7 yuan. Subsequent transactions were sluggish, and the price remained at 717 yuan until midday close. Although there were sellers in the afternoon market, there were few transactions, and the industry showed little enthusiasm. The previous market conditions were observed. The highest price was 718 yuan 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 717 yuan, a difference of 1 yuan 5 jiao. The result was a 2 yuan 2 jiao improvement from the previous close. As of today, the total number of contracts is 17,500, with 31 long positions and 37 short positions.</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange announced yesterday that the bank's Spring Festival holiday will be on the 30th, 31st of this month, and April 2nd, and the Exchange will also be closed for three days. This is hereby announced.</p>

<p>There was absolutely no movement in foreign interbank lending rates.</p>
<p>The foreign interbank lending rate has been at 4% for several days, with very little fluctuation. There was no change in either the morning or afternoon markets yesterday, remaining at 4%, as if it were a fixed template. This is entirely due to the weak supply and demand in the market. The overdraft rate also remained at 2-3%. In terms of interbank lending transactions, morning trades totaled 4.56 million, with new trades amounting to approximately 300,000. Afternoon trades amounted to approximately 500,000. Trades in small trade associations amounted to approximately 200,000.

<p>Jiangnan Slightly Increased, Guangdong Slightly Decreased</p>
<p>Yesterday, the early market price for Jiangnan small silver dollars was 835 yuan, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day.

<p>Securities Only Traded in April Contracts</p>
<p>The 96 Crisis Temporarily Subsides</p>
<p>All Prices Remain in Good Condition</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange only traded April futures contracts for one month. The trend was still upward, and the 96 crisis temporarily subsided. However, it is feared that the bulls are not willing to stop, and there may be another struggle in the future. It is rumored that the rise and fall of 96 this time was not the result of organized manipulation, but was actually driven by strong forces, and many people suffered losses. This is due to blindly following the crowd. The market prices yesterday were still very good, except that the opening in the morning continued the downward trend from the previous day, weakening by about one or two jiao. Afterwards, due to the firm salt tax, the gold short position turned into a slight increase of one or two jiao. Market sentiment recovered, and the second session saw a unanimous rebound of two or three jiao to five or six jiao. The situation improved, and market sentiment became excited again. The afternoon sessions saw increases of four, five, or six jiao in each session. The salt tax, which had retreated to 54 yuan, ended up approaching 55 yuan. The closing was quite strong, but there were still many 96 transactions, and there was no strength to rise. Both</p>

<p>Film Special Edition: The War of American and British Films Intensifies with "Catherine the Great" Xi Leng</p>
<p>The war between American and British films began with "Henry VIII." In mid-October of last year, British producer Alexander Korda's blockbuster "The Private Life of Henry VIII" (translated into Chinese as "An Intimate History of the English Court") was released in the United States and was hailed by American film tycoons as one of the world's top ten films of 1933. Consequently, British filmmakers began to reveal their ambition to challenge the dominance of American films in the world. However, it was with "Catherine the Great" that this film war truly gained unstoppable momentum. This historical epic recounting the life of Russian Empress Catherine originally had two versions. One was produced by a British film company, also titled "Catherine the Great," starring the talented British dramatic actress Elizabeth Bergner and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. The other was produced by the American Paramount Pictures. To distinguish itself from the British film and to precede its production, it was renamed "The Scarlet Empress," starring German actress Marlene Dietrich. The British "Catherine the Great" was completed earlier and premiered in New York on February 14 at the Astor Theatre, with prominent figures from all walks of American life invited to attend, creating a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>Although this "Catherine the Great" was filmed in London, the American United Artists Corporation was entrusted as its manager and distributor, and a major Broadway theater was chosen as the venue for its premiere. This caused an uproar in the entire American film industry and marked the first time in American film history that a British film was able to sell tickets for two dollars in New York, with advance reservations and two screenings a day. This not only demonstrates that the American United Artists Corporation has clearly acknowledged that British films like "Catherine the Great" are on par with the finest products of Hollywood, but also that its ticket prices are comparable to those of standard Broadway stage plays. Therefore, the American film industry could not help but feel somewhat alarmed, as this was indeed the first British film to reap millions of dollars in revenue in the American market and carry it away. Before the economic recovery, millions of dollars could certainly arouse envy.</p>
<p>This was also a matter of 1934. A year earlier, if anyone had said that British films would invade the American market in this way and achieve victory, they would have been considered insane. But now, these fantasies have become reality, demonstrating the significant progress made by the British film industry in the past twelve months. This is enough to make the self-proclaimed and arrogant American film tycoons feel apprehensive. After the release of "An Intimate History of the English Court" in the United States, the general American public still regarded it as a mere occasional masterpiece from Britain, insufficient to add lasting glory to British films. However, with the subsequent arrival of "Catherine the Great" and its victory surpassing the previous film, American producers were forced to ponder deeply.</p>
<p>The Hollywood film tycoons who were initially alarmed were Samuel Goldwyn and Joseph M. Schenck. Goldwyn, the owner of MGM, issued a serious warning after seeing "An Intimate History of the English Court" and "Catherine the Great." He said, "Unless Hollywood wakes up immediately and fundamentally reforms its production policy, focusing on quality rather than quantity, Hollywood's authority in global film production will be severely impacted. In terms of film production, whether geographically or otherwise, there is no such thing as a patent or monopoly this year; the current development of British production is clear proof of this." Goldwyn's words, of course, carry the weight of authority and cannot be ignored. Schenck, the head of United Artists, recently returned to the United States after investigating the British film industry in England. His first simple yet terrifying words upon arriving in the United States were: "The British are coming!" But he also said that Americans should not regard the British attack as something to be feared, but rather as a stimulant, "We can only accept it with the attitude of an athlete and strive to resist," he said.</p>
<h3>Audience Opinions: A Discussion of "Dancing Palace Dreams" Ding Ding</h3>
<p>Undeniably, this is one of the American films that imitates the supremacy of love. It uses "dance girls" and "college students" as its themes, and develops the story through their love affairs.</p>
<p>There are two points here that deserve our attention:</p>
<p>(1) How contradictory is real society! On the one hand, it creates various reasons that force women in certain environments to indulge in this kind of pleasure-seeking life. Of course, there are exceptions: as for whether it is "unavoidable" for a self-proclaimed female writer to become a dance girl, that is questionable. On the other hand, once she falls into this kind of life, society immediately revokes her status as a "person," and from then on, she is forever a dance girl worth only "forty cents a dance," subject to ridicule, until she escapes from this sea of ​​misery. We express considerable agreement with the screenwriter's sympathy for the suffering of dance girls; however, we cannot help but regard it as a distortion of the screenwriter's consciousness to consider pursuing rich young men to achieve the goal of becoming a new person as the way out for dance girls.</p>
<p>(2) Let's look again: the crisis in this drama stems from medical expenses of "at least three hundred yuan a month." It is because of these medical expenses that Manman remarries, which is why the final misfortune occurs. Therefore, "Dancing Palace Dreams" further tells us that in the city, it is best not to get sick if you have no money, otherwise, medical expenses of "at least three hundred yuan a month" will scare you at least.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't help but be disappointed. The simplicity of the dance hall, the inappropriate clothing of the dance girls (except for Manman), have regrettably ignored the scenes that are easy to please the general audience. Among the actors, except for Fan Xuepeng, who is more satisfactory from the point of view of changing her style, Yu Guang, who plays Cai Xiaofeng, is simply a complete failure, even the simplest movements (such as walking, coughing) and expressions (such as the grief after receiving the expulsion letter from school, and the panic when his father discovers that he is living with a dance girl) are not done well. Originally, this was a tragedy, but due to the weakness of the protagonist's performance, the "tragedy" was never truly tragic.</p>
<p>As for the director, although there are some small skills, many places are too confusing. The smile of the school worker after delivering the letter, Cai's father disowning his son with tears, the unexpected protection of the dance girl by the dance hall manager, and Cai Xiaofeng's unquestioning belief in the newspaper reports.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Comments on "Dancing Palace Dreams" Er Yin</h3>
<p>Fan Xuepeng's expressions in the lead role are not very deep, and sometimes they are overdone, but the gaze and bitter smile in the prison at the end are commendable. At that time, I felt that she was a bit like Ruan Lingyu. She really is very promising and also very beautiful.</p>
<p>Yu Guang's performance in this film is not satisfactory, especially the coughing, which is too artificial. One viewer said: "There won't be one in a thousand people who cough like that."</p>
<p>Wei Pengfei is also just so-so. But perhaps it is due to the director. In the scene of the reunion of father and son, the audience thought there would be a more moving performance, but the result was nothing. The separation is also not completely appropriate.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Ma Dongwu's portrayal of Manager Feng is better. The anxiety in front of the sickroom in one scene of "Enchanting Scenery" (projected in Nanjing) is not bad.</p>
<p>In terms of the plot, there also seems to be some inappropriateness at the fundamental level. Since Cai Xiaofeng knew that Manman was working as a dance girl, he should have been able to think about where the three hundred yuan came from and therefore understand her. As for jealousy, it is even more inconsistent with the facts. He originally had no love rival, so why would he immediately suspect her without showing any sympathy?</p>
<p>Also, Cai Xiaofeng's illness got better too quickly, and it was also unexpectedly severe. When he was sick, he didn't look sick either.</p>
<p>Cai's cousin seems to be his backup lover, always waiting for him no matter what, but there is no explanation in the play. The author probably means that all cousins ​​are lovers of their cousins; no, they all love their cousins.</p>
<p>In addition, the whole play doesn't offer any advice to the dance girls, doesn't find a way out for the dance girls, and only offers a little weak and pessimistic sympathy, which is meaningless.</p>
<p>As for the father-son relationship and expulsion from school, they are all old tricks from Tianyi Film Company, as if there is no way to change to another kind.</p>
<p>In short, this film is not for the dance girls, nor for anyone else. I don't know what it is for after all?</p>
<p>Personally, I think the only thing worth taking is (a hint of resentment is deeply buried in her heart, which will never be known or understood by anyone. This is slightly able to evoke sympathy.)</p>
<h3>"Tarzan the Ape Man" and "Wild Cat" are About to Break Up Fu</h3>
<p>Johnny Weissmuller, the star of "Tarzan the Ape Man," and the famous Mexican wild cat Lupe Velez, were married not long ago last year, but it has been reported that they have separated. Although they reconciled after mediation, this rift is probably difficult to heal in the end, especially when it comes to these American movie stars. Some people say: When these many male and female stars get together, if they could use more brains (thinking) and less heart (love), they would definitely live more satisfying lives. People like Weissmuller and Velez should not have gotten together in the first place, because one is volatile and explosive (Velez) and the other is dull and not easily excited, and their natures are completely different. Their union was entirely a temporary curiosity and a blind impulse of love, and was mostly motivated by Velez's admiration for the healthy and majestic physique of this "Tarzan the Ape Man," so it is difficult to last. From this kind of separation and reunion, we can also know that the general theory that "when the poles meet, they must cancel each other out to achieve equilibrium and unity" is not valid in human nature, because human nature is not as simple as electricity or magnetism after all.</p>

<h3>Film Novel "Carolina" (5) Wen Yin</h3>
<p>That day, the person Will thought of and could not forget was none other than that peasant woman, Jonna. Although Fortinny's clothes were very exquisite, the psychology of being too flattering and ingratiating was too obvious, which made him have to turn his thoughts to that innocent and radiant country girl in rough clothes. The people in the Connally family, despite wearing old clothes, can all be themselves and don't care at all. Therefore, he and Fortinny already felt somewhat incompatible in terms of clothing and appearance. Furthermore, Fortinny smoked cigarettes, which reminded him of what he and Jonna had just said. Perhaps women are already smoking cigarettes now (times have changed) except for Connally, everything has changed...</p>
<p>When it came to dinner, Scipio clumsily served, and Fortinny wore even more resplendent clothes...Will thought she must be feeling uneasy wearing that dress. Old Robert, as always, talked incessantly...his mind was almost dissipated...He raised his glass to toast to the past Connally, he shouted to drink Mantra wine, but Mantra wine had been finished years ago...what they are drinking now seems to be cooking wine. After dinner, Will and Fortinny took a walk under the soft moonlight. He listened absentmindedly to Fortinny's words of praise, his heart had already flown to Jonna's side...Lino was singing there (but he was thinking of Jonna, wondering if she was listening too.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow, because there is a dance party for Fortinny in the evening, everyone is busy. In order to avoid all the complexities and Fortinny's flattery, Will took a gun and went to the woods to hunt birds. He didn't slowly come back until almost dusk. When he got closer to the house where Jonna lived, he was surprised to hear the sound of arguing. He looked from a distance and only saw Scipio and two black women standing there, each of them holding a lot of flowers in their hands. He knew that those were all kinds of flowers grown by Jonna herself, and now it seemed that they had been eaten by a group of locusts. He heard Biona shout: "What are you doing stealing my flowers?" Scipio said in a clumsy voice: "This is Mrs. Connally's land, this is Connally's flower! You are a poor white woman living here because Mrs. Connally let you." Jonna cried, and she shouted in exasperation: "How dare you talk to me like that?" Will hurried forward. He put on a straight face and said to the black slave: "Scipio, what the hell are you doing here?" Scipio said somewhat fearfully: "Nothing, Mr. Will, nothing, sir. Mrs. Connally asked me to get some flowers for Miss Fortinny's dance party tonight, so I came to ask Miss Jonna if she would be willing to give me some flowers..." Jonna sobbed and said: "I don't know anything about any dance party." Will then shouted at Scipio and told him to put the flowers down, but Jonna said: "Mr. Will, please let them take them. If Mrs. Connally wants them...I think...he should talk to me first...of course Mrs. Connally is most welcome...any flowers, I am willing to give them." When the black slaves heard this, they quickly ran away with many flowers in their arms. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Group Still Remains in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Bandit rumors: Last year, three major groups of pirates came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The first group robbed the Pu'an Steamer, and the kidnapped passengers have now been ransomed. The second group robbed the Yi Sheng Steamer, and it is said that thirteen of them were the main bandits, while the other eight were temporary recruits. There is still one group that remains in Shanghai and has not yet left. Their purpose is to wait for an opportunity to rob a ship. As for which ship they will rob, the bandits say it cannot be predicted, but there is no doubt that it will happen. It is hoped that the shipping industry in Shanghai will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Company Issues Declaration Endorsing Tax Rate Revision</h3>
<p>The Original Petition is True and Accurate, Every Word a Tear</p>
<p>Cannot Bear to Stand by and Watch Fellow Businesses Perish</p>
<p>Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, in order to endorse the revision of the current tax rate, issued a declaration stating, "We have learned that the twenty-four tobacco factories, including the People's Tobacco Factory, have petitioned the government to improve the current cigarette tax rate, which heavily taxes lower-grade tobacco and lightly taxes higher-grade tobacco, resulting in unequal treatment. The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance has sent a letter to the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Association for review. After discussion and resolution at the association's meeting, it was decided to ask fellow businesses to express their opinions as much as possible. Our company has been established for many years, has a long history of operation, and sells a large quantity of tobacco, so we cannot remain silent. Since cigarettes flowed into China, money has been flowing out at a rate of tens of millions each year. Our fellow businesses have worked hard to make ends meet, but it only slightly plugs the leaks. In recent years, our government has spared no effort to protect and promote domestic industries. Although cigarettes are a luxury item, they are still an industry. Even if protective tariffs cannot be implemented, at the very least there should be equal treatment, so that Chinese merchants can compete with foreign merchants. The twenty-four factories, including the People's Tobacco Factory, stated that during the seven-level tax era, there were as many as 150 to 160 Chinese tobacco factories. During the two-level era, many went bankrupt, and now only 40 to 50 remain. Also, in the past, Chinese merchants sold more and paid less tax, while now Chinese merchants sell less but pay more tax. These statements are true and accurate, every word a tear. Under the current new tax rate, the second level has a widened price range up to 300 yuan, and the tax on high-grade tobacco is further reduced. Of the remaining 40 to 50 factories, very few will not succumb to this tax rate and go bankrupt. Our company is also a Chinese merchant, and fortunately we have some high-grade tobacco products, so we also benefit slightly. However, we cannot bear to stand by and watch fellow businesses perish. Furthermore, if the tax on high-grade tobacco is low, sales will be brisk, and if the tax on low-grade tobacco is high, sales will be sluggish. And the tobacco leaves for low-grade tobacco are all domestically produced. If this is stagnated, then the livelihoods of farmers will be cut off. How can we bear to sit by and watch farmers in several provinces starve to death and not care? Our company is sympathetic to the original request made by the People's Tobacco Factory, even though we were not listed. At this time, our government is busy with military affairs, and the Ministry of Agriculture is in financial straits, so when raising funds hastily, it did not have time to consider and temporarily implemented this unequal tax rate. This is not the government's original intention to promote and protect industry. After our fellow businesses have earnestly appealed, we believe they will also accept it. As for the fellow businesses' suggestions for tax reform, the more levels there are, the more evenly the burden will be distributed. Otherwise, extracting taxes based on price is the fairest. As the saying goes, 'The country is rich, but the people are not exhausted; the tax is high, but the rate is not harsh.' In short, our company only needs it to be beneficial to our fellow businesses and beneficial to the people's livelihood. Even if there are sacrifices, we will not hesitate. We hope that all fellow businesses will consider this."</p>
