<p>時評</p>
<h3>奥變内幕之透視恒</h3>
<p>此次奥國社會民主黨之暴動。勢若狂風驟雨飄忽而至。令人猝不及防然。未及數日。卽告慘敗。似夫杜爾夫斯之鐵腕力能控制此危殆之大局也。不謂奥政府之凱歌甫奏。卽聞杜爾夫斯之乞援於國聯。繼復有法意英三國維持奥國獨立之表示。一若未來之禍。將有遠過於此次之暴動者。此實使人疑惑不置者也。</p>
<p>然吾人一考其内幕。則知杜爾夫斯所惶恐者。非爲社會黨之死灰復燃。而爲德國國社黨之趁火打刦而法意所驚駭者。亦非爲社會黨之捲土重來。而爲德奥合併之促成。打破多瑙河流域之均勢。重使德國成爲中歐之欛主耳。按德國自凡爾賽和約訂立之後。在歐洲喪失土地二萬七千英方里。人口六百餘萬。分别歸併於法比意荷波蘭諸國。設德奥合併之謀而能實現。則德國可驟增土地三萬二千英文里。人口六百五十萬。一舉而彌補其戰後在歐洲之損失。寗非快事。德奥同文同種憑民族自决之原則。合併而治。原極自然。不能與侵略併吞相提並論。此爲洞悉德奥民族歷史者所夙知。聖日耳曼和約所以特别規定奥國獨立之條文。亦以德奥民族相同。易於合併。用特設此伏筆。籍爲將來實行制止之張本。但德奥自大戰而後。事實上確曾有合併之願望。如一九一八年十二月十二日奥國憲法草案曾宣言。「德族奥國爲德意志共和國之一部。關於德族奥國參預德意志共和國之立法行政及推行德意志共和國法律於奥境之辦法。另製特别法規定之。」翌年三月奥國正式憲法中。亦有類似之聲明。至於德國憲法。雖無露骨之表示。其第二欵中亦謂「爲行使民族自决之權利計。德國得容納他國之合併。」用心何在。不言可喻。至一九二一年春。奥國人民多數主張投票解决德奥合併問題。不幸受外力之壓迫。而歸失敗。此後德奥合併。幾成空想。直至一九二八年後。始謀另闢蹊徑。由經濟上之聯盟。而圖政治上之結合。孰意法國洞燭其隱。指爲違約。卒於一九三一年經國際法庭之判决。使此經濟聯盟之美夢。爲之驚破。自是厥後。德奥合併。復陷於僵境。迨德國國社黨首領希脫拉勢力勃興之後。始有峯廻路轉之勢。希脫拉本屬奥籍。希望合併之心。較人更爲濃厚。其所採之手腕。亦殊爲巧妙。卽於奥國組織同一之國社黨。奪取其政權。操縱其内閣。使奥國之内外政策。悉仰德意志之鼻息。如是則旣不與和約之條文相抵觸。又能收合併之實效。故希氏以爲爲計之得。莫過於此。</p>
<p>雖然。希氏之辦法。妙則妙矣。而其所遭逢之困難。反增於前。蓋往昔反對德奥合併者。以外力爲多。今則雖奥亦持異議。推敲其故。要以希氏施政鹵莽激烈。黨同伐異。一旦登臺。有我無人。遂使奥之政黨。聞而驚怖。向者力求合併而不可得。今則視合併爲自殺之畏途矣。最近二年來。杜爾夫斯裁制希黨在奥之活動。不遺餘力。蓋悉以此恐怖爲動機。夫剷除異已。固希黨之所優爲。今杜氏卽以其人之道。反治其人之身。結果遂亦流爲法西斯化而不自覺。總之。今次之事變。首當其衝者。固爲奥之社會民主黨。然論其國際之嚴重性。則以希黨活動爲其癓結之所在。不然。杜氏與法意等國。殊毋庸其惶急若此也。謂余不信。曷觀今日奥國政黨之分野。政府黨爲基督教社會黨。其中堅分子爲保守派之天主教徒。向不主張德奥合併者也。而社會民主黨則大多傾向於合併。故謂社會黨之活動。陰受希黨之援助。自爲情理所應有也。</p>
<p>猶憶希脫拉於登臺之前。標語口號。天花亂墜。一若彼面執政。德國卽有出路。不謂執政以來。迅將二年。而其慨然贈予德國民衆之諾言。多未實踐。今者國際之形勢。於伊尤形不利。甚至同文同種之奥國。亦轉而仇已。而寗願託庇於異國保護之下。爲希氏計。誠不知更有何術以善其後也。</p>
<h3>文相受賄案審查日議會空氣緊張</h3>
<p>二百萬元報酬之約定</p>
<p>報紙包百元鈔票五萬</p>
<p>岡本稱獲得各種證據</p>
<p>（東京）日本全國注視之查問委員會本日上午十時四十分開會、今日會議召岡本江藤兩人審議鳩山文相之樺太工業公司五萬元收賄案、與政友會代議士一百二十人有關係之日本人造絲公司及神户製鋼公司事件等綱紀問題、議塲空氣非常緊張、島田委員長最先報告謂、本委員會依照上次會議之决定、已經要求各大臣及林·米田·兩秘書官出席、</p>
<p>會議卽開始查問、濱田國松問、</p>
<p>據聞岡本君有證據證明本案眞相、是否事實、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>本人當然有事實根據、枚敢發言、余可以發表與本案有關係之人物姓名、然不無因此受累者、其責任何人應負、須先决定、</p>
<p>岡本與濱田問答數次次岡、岡本欲說明鳩山文相因解决京都帝大龐川教授事件赴關西、當時爲日本人造絲及神户製鋼所問題暗中活動之眞相、島田委員長警告岡本謂、</p>
<p>岡本君所欲言者與演田君質問無關係、請答覆質問事項、</p>
<p>此時國民同盟之清瀨一郎由自席椰揄島田謂、</p>
<p>委員長欲與演田君通謀禁止岡本發言乎、</p>
<p>兩者間成立　議塲暫時爲之騷　　二百萬報酬　然、岡本繼言謂、</p>
<p>本問題不能一言說盡、鳩山文相留居關西時、其秘書林氏會見財界巨頭野村德七、斡旋股份之處分、而兩者之間、成立二百萬元報酬金之約定、米田君亦與此事件有關係、余帶來其證據書類、如有必要、可以提出示衆、</p>
<p>濱田問、</p>
<p>岡本君十三日關於樺太工業公司之發言有無證據、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>討論證據問題之前、先要說明鳩山文相與本人言動孰有證據力、鳩山文相否認本人與文相夫妻會見之事實無根據、</p>
<p>報紙包百元鈔票五萬元</p>
<p>岡本於是言及樺太工業問題之主要事項謂、</p>
<p>鳩山君當時對余曰、「藤田好三郎正在等候、君可卽時羊往會見」、余卽往見藤田、則藤田首先開口曰、「君承辦此事麽」、余問曰、「何事」、則藤田非常狼狽、余回到鳩山君處時、鳩山對余謂、「我等商定君已收到金錢、故由裁判所詢問此事時、請答曰確有收到、以新聞紙包之百元鈔票五萬元、余卽對鳩山謂、「如本案與先生一家之浮沈有關係則余可代先生承辦此事、」後來余因此問題被司法當局以消滅證據罪問、但緩行起訴、</p>
<p>濱田問、</p>
<p>緩行起訴之點非常重要、此事係事實乎、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>余聞入說如此、尚未調查是否眞假</p>
<p>時至十一時五十五分會議暫時休息、</p>
<p>查問岡本一已氏案仍於本日午後一時四十分在緊張空氣中繼續開會、關於神户製鋼股票及台灣銀行股票問題、與鳩山三土兩相之關係、由濱田氏查問曰、</p>
<p>台灣銀行股票之出售、對於時期與價值、縱令有不當之處、而米田及林氏兩人之關係、在事實上之有無、尚屬别一問題、岡本君所謂得到之圖解、（上面錄有交與金錢之系統者）、究係何人所製造、</p>
<p>岡本答、</p>
<p>政友會之議員窪并義道君、</p>
<h3>連累之人多以不言爲是</h3>
<p>岡本乃將該項圖　　表交與島田委員　　長、復由委員長　　當由島田委員長　　交與各委員以便傳觀、當由島田委員長發言曰、</p>
<p>此項圖表、待後複製再行奉還、</p>
<p>岡本卽謂、</p>
<p>我不願作無益之傷害、倘將此項内幕說明、則連累之人當屬多數、故以不言爲是、</p>
<p>至謂朝鮮北部鳩山農塲之管理員森田政義氏、去年裝運許多每張百元之鈔票、由其東家命其分配、據說人數當在一百人以上、</p>
<p>上田氏復欲追究、岡本氏則謂、此事再無對答之必要、</p>
<p>次由清瀨一郎氏查問、小山法相要求藤田孝三郎事件之關係文件已經三日、至今尚未提出是何理由、</p>
<h3>齋藤内閣崩潰後？</h3>
<p>高橋山本聯合内閣說</p>
<p>（東京）紀綱問題惡化之後、鳩山文相之辭職、已成爲不可避免、勢將發展至齋藤内閣之總辭職、據政界觀察、齋藤内閣因紀綱問題引咎辭職、則日皇組閣之大命、决不再降於齋藤、其繼任内閣之領袖究竟何人、預想樞府副議長平沼或朝鮮總督宇垣大將等出馬者、亦有又有高橋藏相與山本内相之聯合内閣說、此聯合内閣與九年度預算之成立有重大關係、齋藤内閣倒後、暫時收拾政局、使預算圓滿成立者、祇有此内閣有可能性、故有如此聯合内閣之說、（十九日聯電）</p>
<p>小山法相答、</p>
<p>旣經公判之記錄、决無拒絶提出之意、清瀨氏問、</p>
<p>所謂新聞不成爲罪過、是何用意、</p>
<p>小山法相答、</p>
<p>報紙上之記載、未負任何責任、</p>
<h3>受賄五萬元法院何不傳</h3>
<p>清瀨氏希望法相處於嚴正之立塲</p>
<p>、其次由武富氏質問、</p>
<p>受賄五萬圓之岡本氏爲何不傳喚至檢事局、而執行調查、</p>
<p>小山法相答、</p>
<p>當時均屬重大事件、積案如林、所謂藤田事件、本處並未接到任何報告、未經傳喚之事情、均可由調查文件之提出以後方能知道、</p>
<p>次由查問委員會之議員森田政義氏要求發言、</p>
<p>予曾在朝鮮管理鳩山農塲、但世人均誤會此農塲、要知此項設備乃爲救濟朝鮮貧民、其目的在此、並無任何利益、予亦非有錢人、鳩山氏對予亦未信用、岡本君所謂散發鉅欵、决無此項事實、</p>
<p>所謂製造圖解之窪井義道氏案、亦由森田氏聲稱、</p>
<p>查六高會乃林氏米田氏等第六高等學校出身之者之會合、窪井氏亦屬該會會員之一、所謂圖表或係臨時雜錄簿記、亦未可知、斷非岡本氏所談之情形、應請要求取消、</p>
<p>岡本氏對於森田氏之主張、亦有發言、唯極不明瞭、最後復對小山法相提出種種質問、午後四時方散會云、（十九日日聯電）</p>
<h3>齋藤進退維谷</h3>
<p>總辭問題内閣意見分歧</p>
<p>（東京）關於鳩山文相等綱紀問題、首相藏相内相等政府首腦部、一致之意見如下、（一）事之眞僞姑置勿論、然事態旣已至此、希望鳩山文相自動表示辭意、後任文相暫不補充、由首相兼懾、（二）鳩山文相如對查問委員會及貴院之糾彈有釋明之至此、希望鳩山文相自動表示辭意、後任文相暫不補充、由首相兼懾、（二）鳩山文相如對查問委員會及貴院之糾彈有釋明之决心時、政府因與中島前商相事情不同、不勸其辭職、且支持文相、以應付議會、（三）對明年度預算之成立、無論貴衆兩院如何非難、决忍耐之、農林省之進加預算、雖因後藤農相患病遷延、然凖備已畢、若農相病勢延長、且政局窮迫時、則於後藤農相缺席之下、提出閣議、務必急速提出議會、事後要求農相承認、然少壯閣員多主張一舉决行總辭職、蓋以查問委員會之審理、如果擴大、不僅鳩山文相三士鐵相、卽任檢事總長之小山法相、台灣銀行所有股處分之監縣責任者高橋藏相、均有被波及之虞、故總辭職之時期、愈早愈妙、且今後之政權勢難望圓滑之推移、齋藤首相大有再組閣之可能性、故主張决行總辭職之意見、目下問内意見、又成對立之勢、（十九日電通電）</p>
<h3>文相卽辭職鐵相亦必不利</h3>
<p>政局非常嚴重</p>
<p>（東京）日本政局、因政友會内部紛爭、與鳩山文相之綱紀問題、非常嚴重、政界各方面對於此時局之意見、大體如下、</p>
<p>（一）鳩山文相應否行引咎辭職、將於鳩山自動决定辭意時考慮、</p>
<p>（二）文相辭職後、料無追求内閣全體責任者、然以倒閣爲目的之一派、將其攻擊之目標轉向三土鐵相、頗爲明顯、然則内閣忙於考慮閣員進退問題、故照舊維持政權爲困難之事、</p>
<p>（三）然現内閣因有「滿洲國」與一九三五·六年之非常時局關係、非但有努力使預算案通過議會之重大責任、且其以爲重要使命之安定人心、一事尚未達成、故任意抛棄内閣、則違反其本身使命、如文相辭職實現、則由齋藤首相對政友會鈴木總裁交涉、請求推舉繼任人、而萬一政友會因内部抗爭擴大、不能考慮繼任問題時、則由首相暫時兼任文相、迴避政變以期預算之圓滿成立、亦未可知、</p>
<p>（四）但因查問委員會及貴族院之態度尚未决定、此事尚難預斷、據聞軍部意見仍然主張國防第一主義、以圓滿通過九年度預算爲最緊急事、如因政變而致預算不能成立、則國防工作受大影響、故不論現内閣之倒落或否、始終希望預算成立云、（十八日日聯電）</p>

<h3>李杜今日返滬</h3>
<p>赴新疆由中央命令决定</p>
<p>安置將士眷屬得三辦法</p>
<p>前吉林自衛軍總司令李杜將軍、前赴津晤馬將軍占山、兹事畢離津返滬、國聞社記者昨晤前該軍參謀長王子耀氏於其靜安寺路寓邸、據談、李將軍於今日午後可抵滬、兹將所談情形錄誌若次、</p>
<h3>歡迎李氏入新</h3>
<p>記者訪晤王氏後、首訊以李氏赴新疆收拾舊部之事、據答、此事在一月前、李鑒於留新舊部、無人主持、當時曾一度有意凖備前往、且新省亦有電表示歡迎、電文大意謂、省馬之爭、内幕複雜、留部士官、差將萬人、遠戍邊區、切望來新收拾、聽候中央點編云云、因此李將軍乃有赴新之意、惟目下入新與否、統須由中央决定、如中央有命、當卽首途前往、李將軍前日接電、謂准二十日到滬、至於留新部隊尚有八千六百餘名、除二千一百餘名爲蘇炳文將軍舊部、自設吉林辦事處統率外、其餘均爲吉林自衛軍、由鄭潤成司令率領、目前一切給養服裝、係由盛主席供給、但每一士兵月餉僅領一元、故生活極爲困苦、咸希望中央能迅予正式改编、</p>
<h3>流落津滬眷屬</h3>
<p>嗣文承王氏語記者、前由東北逃俄吉林軍官兵眷屬共三百四十餘名、現在滬差近二在名、天津一百人、北平四十餘人、此種眷屬、大半男人、尚在新疆、故對生活問題、極難解决、此三百四十餘人中、三分之一、係蘇將軍部下眷屬、余（王自稱）之留滬、亦因辦理此事而滯留也、現已覓取安置辦法三項、呈准中央、蓋中央亦以有功東北戰士之家屬、忍使長此流離、其辦法分三步、（一）安置官佐、自能賺錢、則眷屬不虞匱乏、（二）眷屬資遣新疆、因大半女眷、夫君尚遠戍未回、（三）自相謀生維持、以上三種辦法、現僅第三項自相維持爲最難、蓋吉林人士、至華東謀生、其言語不通、已屬極大困難、况令自謀出路、人地兩疏、則更難矣、故此事現統由余負責辦理中、諒最短期間、必有較善之解决辦法也云云、</p>

<p>廣州機塲　粤陜綫原定本月六日開航、嗣廣東省政府以廣州瘦狗嶺軍用飛機塲、民航借用、諸多未便、而廣州原擬加闢民用機塲、已劃定地點、令廣州市政府提前趕築、俾早完成、卽可供粤陜航綫飛機停落、致一時未能開航、其後又有跑馬塲可暫時借用之說、該公司以跑馬塲是否適用、及民用機塲何日可以竣工、均有待於實地察勘、故總經理李景縱自漢回滬後、略躭擱一二日、卽將偕工程師赴粤一行、俾早日開航粤陜綫、</p>
<p>復航新疆　前日報載南京電、有盛世才電歐亞公司請求於本月二十八日前復航迪化、昨日某報並載有該公司已從有籌備之訊、據該公司秘書查鎭語新聲社記者、對復航新疆、公司方面、無時不在籌劃之中、惟事實上因戰亂未停、無從進行、而迪化·甘肅·間之哈密站、仍爲馬仲英之勢力範圍、戰禍未弭、一時終難辦到、至盛世才來電請求、則本公司迄未收到、</p>

<h3>川河各輪公司挽救航業</h3>
<p>丨昨午議定合作同盟丨</p>
<p>棉紗運費漲起十元</p>
<p>各貨水脚全部提高</p>
<p>上海至四川重慶一路、向來從宜昌轉運川河輪至渝、自從近年民生·提江·太古·怡和·以及其他各輪公司競開滬渝值航班後、水脚狂跌、昔日川河一綫、航業界視作黄金航路者、至上年幾等鷄肋、運費旣短、貨又缺乏、釀成爭航過烈、入不敷出、而致各公司同蒙極大之損失、兹爲挽救川河航業、各輪公司已决計放業昔日之競爭聾度、改取同盟合作之主張、使各公司聯合一致、提高水脚昨晚已經在滬會議、决定合作方針、本館記者以此事關係揚子江航業甚巨、特赴各方切實調查、分誌槪况如下、</p>
<h3>運價低落航輪虧耗</h3>
<p>上海運赴四川之去貨、以棉紗爲最大宗、在曩昔水脚最高時、每件棉棉紗、運往重慶須收費三十兩以上、此尚係由宜昌轉渝之價目也、近年自各輪公司添開上海重慶之直放船後、各輪船但顧競裝、不計成本、上年迭次跌减、在最短時、每件棉紗祇收八元、卽水淺期内亦祇收十二元、合諸銀兩、僅八兩五錢餘、殊不敷各輪行駛之成本、因棉紗跌價、其他各貨、亦隨同低落、上年川河各輪無一可以獲利、幾全都均受損虧、</p>
<h3>協議挽救同盟合作</h3>
<p>現在滬上航行川河之輪、有太古·怡和·捷江··三北·民生·光耀·招商·等各公司、本月初、英商太古等鑒於川河輪常此貶價競航、其結果必致兩敗俱傷、徒使受無謂的犧牲、因之太古等與華商、民生·川北·等各公司恊議挽救川漒航業方策、第一泯除各公司之競航、實現同盟合作、援照滬甬班内四公司以開營業之先例、凡行川河輪船、一致的聯合營業、重定各貨運貨、遵守同盟條例、不得再有私自漲跌、各公司之運貨給單、須彼此交換、觀覧此項辦法、已得各公司全體贊同、</p>
<h3>昨午會議公開辦法</h3>
<p>太古·恰和·民生·捷江·三北·等昨日午後四時、已各派代表齊集外灘捷江公司、公開會議、討論川河輪之同盟合作公開辦法、光耀公司亦請加入、聞華商方面、有數項意、見提出、如高縣、一埠、英輪迄未通航、該埠華輪裝載之貨、應不列在合作條件内、又夔州至巫山一段、應歸華輪行駛、郵件等裝運、各船各載、不列公攤、如有運兵等事、則由華輪供差、惟該時期營業、亦應照公攤、此爲各華輪公司所提出者、其他則均可按照公議辦法、一致遵守之、</p>
<h3>提高水脚重訂運率</h3>
<p>各輪公司之合作原則通過後、卽續議川河水脚應行提高、照目前水脚、殊　不敷成本、虧損堪虞、而上海運川之貨、以棉紗爲主、卽將運紗水脚作爲標的、按照目前、每件棉紗自滬至渝定價爲十二元、今則公議增加十元、每件運費提漲至二十二元、按照原率約增十分之八、其他雜貨運費、亦依照棉絲水脚比例、逐項站漲十分之七八分不等、其詳細貨品的太利夫（卽運費單）、由各公司代表另行議定之後、重訂新價、再行宣布實行、各代表當時一致通過、</p>
<h3>報關公所亦開議</h3>
<p>川帮各報關行得聞此訊、以川河航輪現各輪旣有變更現制、同盟合作、提高運費之事則此舉與各報關行亦殊有聯帶關係、故亦於昨日由各報關行召集全體川帮同業、假報關公所内開緊急會議、討論接受各輪公司新水脚及新辦法後之與客家接洽情事、至於各輪公司之同盟合作、俟辦法草定運率公布、在本月内例須公同實行、</p>
<h3>川河現行中外航輪</h3>
<p>現時滬上行駛川河之商輪、自上海到重慶一路者、捷江公司有四船、民生公司亦有四船、太古·怡和·各有三輪、三北公司有富華·富陽·等兩輪、招商局有一船、現在擱礁中、其他如光耀公司共有六輪、以上均直航滬渝綫者、尚有上海至宜昌、路者、捷江·民生·太古·怡和·等又有十餘船、</p>
<h3>法院將派法醫騐李國杰病狀</h3>
<p>最高法院裁判尚無消息</p>
<p>前招商輪船局總經理李國杰、因私借外債、舞弊行賄案、經上海地方法院偵訊結果、除判處李徒刑三年外、並通緝在逃之陳孚木及王允章等、旋李不服上訴、復經高等法院傳案審訊、改判三年六月、將李送法院後、因李夙有暗疾、不能久覊、由本市阜昌參行及江一平律師具報法院、諭送上海醫院留住、並派警多名輪流維護、起居尚爲優適、惟李前又聲明不服、向最高法院上訴、爲終審機關、迄今尚無裁判消息、而地方法院對於李案非常注意、接見賓客及書信出入、均嚴密監視、且李因病入院就醫、已達一年、是否痊愈、不得而知、故擬派法醫、前往該院檢騐、以明眞相、</p>

<h3>讀書指導：</h3>
<p>「現社會裏所須要的是那一科的人才」？這個問題，恐怕任何人也不能具體的提出答案罷？在這失業的洪水汜濫中，可以說什麽人才都有多餘，都用不着；一想到中國事業的不發達；一想到倘若有一天我們要談建設，又會感覺到什麽人才都不够，都有用。現在確是陷於這種矛盾中，這大槪是在這過渡期間的中國的必然的現象罷！</p>
<p>我們在「讀書問答」中，曾經屢次指出個人的「出路」要與社會的「出路」相適合，否則你祗有幻想，失望。達不到眞正的「出路」。爲了「出路」而去注知，自然是最正確的方法。但你千萬不能只他眼睛看了自已，不管社會。你說：「我之讀書爲圖生存」。如果你說的「生存」是指與社會共存共榮，這是正確的；如果僅爲了你一人暫時的偷生，那「讀書」不但太無意義，而且是不能達到目的的。</p>
<p>讀書的目的旣不能限於自已個人的自私，因此對於選擇學習的門徑，也不宜專柬自已喜歡的。至少，個人的興趣只能放在次要的地位，不能不特别注意。</p>
<p>麩來信中有個很大的矛盾，你一面高唱「增長謀生技能而讀書」而你所選擇的是什麽呢？是不能謀生的「詩詞」，是中國過去文藝古董。據你說是要「發揮胸中的感觸」，這目的顯然是已改變了。</p>
<p>我們不反對讀者自由的選擇學習的科目，我們原只站在旁觀的立塲，作些指引與顧問。你要研究文學，雖然這對於「爲增長謀生技能」爲目的的你，我們不能担保你會不失望，可是這確也是一條路，就是按照社會的需要說，也不能說某一時代可以不要文學。但是，你所選擇的却是過去的古董，只有充足的時間，富裕的生活者纔能從事的「雅」業。現在尚用這類體裁「發揮胸中的感觸」的只剩幾個「遺老」「遺少」了。</p>
<p>不用說，這種選擇對於你這様生活的人是有害的。</p>
<p>大槪是因你「終日足不出户，對於社會上的一切是很隔膜」的緣故罷！你對現實生活確太糢糊了。我們覺得像你這様環境下生活的人，應多讀些了解現實社會的書，就是讀文學自然應讀現代的，不宜再去嚼古董。白話詩在中國早有收穫了，其中也有不少的名著名作，值得一讀的。白話的表現表感也比文言自由，死的音韻早解放了，現在用的是天然的音韻，現代的音韻，早用不着「詩韻」那類的廢物了。</p>
<p>所以，從我們對你的估量，你在業餘要研究點詩，也是可以的，但請你先研究白話詩好了。同時，也還希望你不要忘記現實。須知將來社會　能够生存的人一定是有新的知識，正確的認識，有組織的頭腦，能適合　　體生活，及百折不回的毅力的人。</p>

<h3>獨樂園</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>孟老夫子說，獨樂　不如與衆樂樂，這是最冠冕的話，所以那　專制魔王粉飾太平，都得揭「與民同樂」的幌子出來，好呌老百姓服服貼貼咽着眼涙，山呼萬歲。</p>
<p>偏是司馬不老實不客氣，　他的别墅爲「獨樂園」。　太　先生曾　在某處講席駡過他，說他遠不如先天下之憂而憂後天下之樂而樂的　宗文正公。這還是望文生訓，未免　文周納，誰知那位陳水相公，還不及他的園丁吕直。</p>
<p>元陳彥高北軒筆記云：「司馬公置獨樂園，當春明之際，卉术繁秀，觀者咸以錢與園丁吕直，謂之茶湯錢。積十千而納於公，公却之曰：「吾豈少此哉！」直曰：「天地間只端明不愛錢耶！」於是盡其錢創一并亭，」以便行客。彥高還揄揚主僕說：「只一不愛錢，可並端明，亦可以醒端明，要非端明不能有此僕也。不意君實秀才之外，復有此等人。」其　實端明却有二錯，一不應任園丁納錢，二不應說吾豈少此，幸虧吕直可兒，不讓主人獨善，反而超過主人一着，做一件與衆樂樂的事業來，端明不免到之有愧。</p>
<p>本來「宰相合肥天下瘦，司農常熟世間荒」已成了公例，陳水相公的獨樂園，自然也是逃不掉這個公例的，不過他在政治上還有些建樹，天下雖瘦，還有一點飯好喫，世間雖荒，還有一點米好收。像現在諸公袞袞，别墅相望，不許閒人，寗可鏖封蛛絡。至今淞滬道上，一片瓦礫，當時災黎，不知流落何所。我聽見有人說，前年某公要送一所住宅給某將軍，某將軍說，請移此欵，建首都的平民宿舍罷。這倒是老杜「廣厦千萬間大庇寒士」的詩意，可惜這些話最敗人興。</p>
<p>我責備陳水相公，覺得太苛，未免罪過。因爲他還不是要衆人咽　眼涙，向他山呼萬歲。世上正多着先天下之樂而樂，後天下之憂而憂的相公呢。</p>
<h3>酒店</h3>
<p>— 英君</p>
<p>西北風從兩旁高大的洋房裏刮下來，耳朶好像要脫離了這個肢體。夜的南京路，在冬之神的管轄下，不像夏的熱鬧。在抛球塲的一間黝黑的酒店裏，我們純熟地跨進了門檻。</p>
<p>没有火爐，寒冷仍舊支配着這個空間。在樓頂從玻璃窗裏望出去，冬季大减價的旗幟招展着！</p>
<p>蚶子，鴨肫乾，老大房的熏魚。還有那一縷縷的熱氣，向上昇騰着的青魚尾和奶油菜心。這幾天我們都在醉的狀態中生存着，在這個刮着西北風的夜裏，我應了朋友的約會，仍舊在遥遠的地方；跑到這裏來。</p>
<p>醉的刹那，使我們能够擺脫煩惱之網的籠罩。戒去了一年的酒，又在這幾日心情不寗靜的夜裏；天天在醉鄉裏度着生活。在這裏我們不是參加着一個盛大的宴會，是每一個小市民階級所共有的酒店。蹲在桌子裏每一個醉漢的形態，是眞實的曝露。没有虚僞謙遜，凌人的金錢的交響。這裏是我們把日常積抑着的牢騷，吐洩的地方，時候已到雨雪的嚴冬，第二個的新年又是怱怱的過骈到冷風擲擊的大地。在孩童的時候，我們終希望夜夜元宵，這時没有生的創傷，没有生的苦難，在寂寞的客地裏，想起了幾千里外的家，他們已很忙碌地預備着過年了。『酒入愁腸化作相思涙。』酒後的腦神經裏，時常灌進一些未來的煩惱：這所謂『借酒澆愁愁更愁。』何况一年來，在革鬥的環境裏生存着。</p>
<p>碟子，酒壺堆滿了桌角；臉龐覺得熱烘烘的。蚶子的殻，青魚的骨，在每個的面前；堆滿着像一個小邱。室内的温度，也比較未醉時來得温煖。苦樂人生的謳歌，我們蹣跚地踏出酒店的門。</p>
<p>西北風從兩旁高大的洋房裏刮下來，耳朶好像要脫離了這個肢體。夜的南京路，在冬之神的管轄下；不像夏的熱鬧。，</p>
<h3>月份牌</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>「月份牌是農村婦女的恩物，它們是最最歡迎的，如果是新婚的話，新房的四壁，一定掛滿了「月份牌。」或是廢歷年關，把房間内的蓬　撣掃撣掃，也掛上些新的「月份牌。」</p>
<p>可是有幾幀「月份牌」的確印刷得很華麗，女人也漂亮，要算香烟公司的出品最時髦。在農村的婦女要見到都市中的摩登姑娘，只好向「月份牌」上追求，要做時髦服裝，也得向「月份牌」上學様。但是現在流行的「月份牌」，並没有月份印在上面，只印了一個美女和它們自已的牌號，一些没有意思。倒反使儉樸的婦女漸漸地傾向於奢侈。與其掛一張無意識的畫片，倒不如掛幾張「九一八」或　一二八」中日戰爭畫圖，也可以使一般農民和農村婦女，知道中國的危亡，受人的欺凌，養成它們愛國的心理！這種掛圖就比較月份牌有意識得多呢。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十四回　酌酒傳餐狂歡含别涙挑燈温夢　唱　長更</p>
<p>桂枝道：我呢，你用不着安慰了。只是老太爺那裏，和　我母親那裏，你應當去和他們談談，安慰安慰他們幾句。自强道：我們老太爺呢，那還好一點，令堂那裏，可是不能不去安慰幾句的。你可别睡覺，等着我，我就會來的。桂枝笑道；我還給你預備吃的呢，那裏能够先睡？自强經夫人提醒了，就一刻也不能忍耐，馬上起身向前院裏去。今天岳老太太的態度，也改了，見着姑爺，只是一味的疼惜着。這倒讓自强神明内疚，不能不和他只管談下去。談過之後，再到父親屋子裏說話。等他回到新人屋子裏來的時候，已經十二點多了。只見又擺了四個小菜碟子，桂枝坐在矮椅子上，兩手按了膝蓋，好像在專門等候什麽似的。他見了自强，立刻向前握了他的手道：你談了這様一夜了，我怕你肚子餓着，預備阵個碟子，下幾根麫條子你吃。自强笑道：其實我們坐着清談一會子，也就得了，何必還要費勁。桂枝笑道：照着今天的情形說起來，你就是一位客了。我鞗主婦的，招待客還不是應該的嗎？自强笑道：這話可說回來了。你作主婦的，自然是應該招待客，請問這主人翁又在那裏呢？桂枝拉着他椅子上坐下，掀着門簾子，伸頭向外看了一看，然後掩上了房門，打開櫉子，取出一小瓶酒，在燈前向自强一幌，笑道：我偷偷的陪你喝三杯罷。自强喝的酒，也只剛剛醒過來。並不想喝酒。只是夫人如此說了，又不能推却，便笑道：設若喝醉了呢？桂枝將酒瓶摇了幾摇道：你瞧瞧這個，這也不過四兩酒，你二兩，我二兩　四兩酒，太槪醉不了兩個人吧？咱們偷偷的喝着，誰也不知道。（三一六）</p>

<h3>寒天保護金魚譚吳吉人</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>寒天，凡百動物，都喜和，暖金魚亦未能免俗。寒水冰凍，金魚往往冰冷而死，惟已冰之魚，未必卽僵，嘗以冰魚置温水，陳斧熱之，水熱，魚能漸蘇，亟易井水，（初吊起者），另器處内室中，日光强盛，移就之，待冬盡　　，仍擺缸中，可無恙矣。</p>
<p>冬季老魚，易側　臥缸　，其　病之由，不外二途：（一）　尾受創，血跡殷然，猶人之四肢脈絡不和，不能動作，（一）孕卵纍然，腹大如鼓，而側重一面，游動時不能平復似初，以是坦腹僵臥，其實能食能洩，春發依然無妨。</p>
<p>黄沙缸入泥及半，嚴寒仍結堅冰欲防患未然，祇有每晚在缸面舖以　草之薦，日出移去，使陽光受充分照射，或遇重雲下降，可不必移去草薦，惟草薦安放缸面，以距離數寸爲上，因氣候雖冷，空氣仍宜透露也。</p>
<p>雲書兄約吳苑荼叙，晤徐偉士先生，偉士告治金魚生白點及露塊方，謂屢試不爽。當初起時，亟將病魚自缸中取出，取大硯台，用陳墨蘑汁，（墨非陳者不可，近日坊間所售之洋烟，品斯下矣，非惟無效，且可速魚之死，）瀝入碗中，（碗中不可有油），使魚沐浴墨汁中，不移時，取出以清水爲之洗潔，霉病可全失，决無碍，偉士之言如此，余尚未之試，惟渠亦藝魚數十年，必無謬誤也。同志曷試之。余前治霉魚，以强度電光，照射半日，魚身白點能成紅色，霉病亦可立除，惟電光照射過熱，水亦宜注宜更換，蓋治魚時，我人須謹愼將事者，然較之徐先生之方，難易懸殊矣　　或問上海寸金地，决無養魚機會矣，余曰：不然。大馬路冠生園恊理薛壽齡先生，家居鬧市，賃統樓一間，春間，豢二寸龍蛋種各二尾，置徑尺磁盆中，日中。移日光照射，日斜卽任之，水蛆由魚人安日包去，水亦不甚換，須視穢濁不堪時，始更之，一年來，魚肥且碩，腹中隆然，預計明春且可散子，是則上海人不宜養魚之說破矣。</p>

<h3>旅途雜寫（下）</h3>
<p>— 傳翼之</p>
<p>假如江邊賣到蘭溪的車票，那末，今晚很可以在蘭溪的旅館裏安然度過這一夜，明天中午，卽可給衢蘭汽車載我到衢縣：如果趕得到班次，再由衢縣，而常山，而玉山，當日便可到達上饒，金華到蘭溪，是杭江路的支綫，通車較早，班次也較多，只爲了聽信旁人一句話，票我通宵還旦的在金華候車，一直等到次日中午，這也可見杭江路的火車是怎様的不守時刻了。</p>
<p>金華没有唱那從丹田硬生生擠出的京齣的歌妓胡纒，而且老　娘丨丨一個五十零歲的婦人特别的招待我們，教我們同伴三個到伊店房的後間裏去喝茶，裏面有三張舊靠椅，邊旁是一只長方形的大米櫃，伊的一對小兒女便把這櫃權作他們的炕床，呼呼地在睡覺，靠門是一個煤爐子，老　娘頭　着青布，在爐邊添柴燒開水，水熱了，先在我們靠椅前一張破方桌上的三個茶碗裏冲滿，再提着鉛壺跑到外面店房裏去冲，冲好了，提進來添水，再放上爐子去燒，這様夜以繼日的不斷地工作着：有時，伊也會感到勞倦，便坐在門邊打肫，伊的大兒子（我猜他）是拉黄包車的，因爲我看見他在我們坐的房子裏把自已的長衫給腰帶縛緊，拿着銅鈴，走出門外拉車子，我問伊爲什麽要這様日夜的招攬生意，回答我是：「要吃飯」，我在此深深地感到吃飯的不易了。</p>
<p>最使我難忘的，是：伊把伊的兒女們所蓋的薄被頭抽出一條給我們三個蓋脚，深怕我們躺在靠椅上受塞，這種我佛慈悲般的仁德，管教出門人要感激到五體投地；然而，這也只能偶得之於鄉間的窮前輩，以摧殘生命爲娛樂的現社會裏，可能多得這様的一個人？可是，這裏門穿壁破，冷風乘隙而入，終不能使我們閉目假寐，未免辜負了伊的一番好意。</p>
<p>金華到玉山，本可以當天到達的，因爲纔開始通車，路綫很不穩實，車行極緩，過衢州，大地便已給暮色籠罩住了，同車的一個士兵，也是去山的，因爲玉山接近匪區，晚來戒備極嚴，一過十二點鐘，由車站到街上的一道浮橋便要吊起，不許任何人通過，他身邊没有「符號」，已在衢州下車了，玉山的車站附近没有旅館，車到江山，已是晚間九點鐘了，我爲了避免露宿起見，也在江山落站，預備次日乘汽車到廣豐。</p>
<p>廣豐，是淡巴菇的出產地，每年收買葉子運到上海銷售的「水客」，不下百數十人，現在這個地方，據說也是匪區，烟業生意如何？我可不明白了，汽車速率，超過杭江路的火車三四倍，百二十餘里的路程，不到兩點鐘，便給我載到廣豐了，廣豐雖然也是匪區，但軍隊檢查不嚴，没有良民證（由區長和堡長蓋章證明是良民的符號，每張須售銅元十枚六枚不等）的我，也居然堂而皇之的進城出城。上饒可就更麻煩了。</p>
<p>我出門的日子很久，回到家裏親戚朋友們便一個個給我講活閻王（某地方官的綽號）爲政的「清明」。駡人的「詼諧」，區長的如何潔公奉已，鄉民被派建築公路時的挨打「有趣」，田榖捐，派壯了丁的公事吃緊，食鹽公賣處，堡甲辦公處等的機關不絶地成立……教我聽得頭暈腦脹，便什麽也做不來了，雖然母親的病已可無須擔憂。</p>

<p>里昻（Ｌyon）</p>
<p>一、工業化學學校　此校原爲私立學校之受政府補助者、近則全由私立、化學廠家維持、但附屬於大學行政之下、校内董事、多爲工業家、里昻大學校長亦爲董事之一、學程分三年、如下、第一年無機化學及分析、第二年有機化學、第三年（上學期）應用化學（下學期）染料香料電化微菌製革</p>
<p>重實騐功課、故實習工作極多、入校學生、不須爲高等中學之畢業生已得baccalaureate者、惟須經過入學考試、實騐室及器具設備、寛廣充實、教授均有研究室、</p>
<p>（二）製革學校　此校成立已四十年、創立時、製革業尚極幼稚、旣無專家、又無書籍、現則漸著成績矣、學程分三年、第一二年、習普通化學、及原理、第三年、則偏重製革實習、教授亦多研究工作、該校組織、與工業化學學校相似、董事會亦爲工廠家代表組織而成、政府無補助費、僅處顧問與督責之地位、</p>
<p>（三）中央工程學校　此校爲私立工程學校、其組織近似合資公司、董事負籌畫經濟之責任、學程分四年、其第一年爲預科、故正科祇三年、入學學生、必須經過考試、凡直接考正科者、必須先得高級數學證書之後、正科第一第二年、必須得三種證書、（一）普通數學證書、（二）普通物理證書、（三）力學證書、方得升入第三年、</p>

<h3>（四）英國職業教育</h3>
<p>英國各級教育、在發動之初、每藉私人及公共團體之力爲多、中等教育、初等教育如此、職業教育亦然、我人閱英國職業教育經過之歷史、在當時之英國、工商業已極發達、尚經歷如是之久、方有成効、則職業教育、推行不易、於此可見、英國職業教育之動機、爲一八五一年之工業展覧會、使一般人目睹科學應用於工商業之重要、故一八五三年、卽成立科學美術處、屬於商部、政府撥專欵以奬勵教授科學之學校、由處以總其成、其奬勵金之多寡、視學生之成績、惟奬勵範國、以自然科學爲限、而不及工業教育、及一八八○年、倫敦各業學會成立、由各業會集欵、以補助工程學科、而工業教育、遂同受其賜、而日有進境、五十餘年間、由政府之倡導奬勵、民衆團體之努力、英國職業教育、遂蔚然成大觀矣、工藝學院、都由私人創辦、其最初目的、在融合道德健身合羣三項活動、以爲訓練之基礎、爲教育機關、而兼修養身心之所、行政事務、有委員會主持之、而倫敦市政委員會必有相當代表人數、參加會務、爲免除學科上重複起見、各工藝學院間、均先期五相議定、各授某種工程學科、例如機械工程、電機工程等、爲一類、化學工程爲一類、建築工程爲又一類、各由一工藝學院、或數院分任之、此其大槪情形也、多數初級工業商業學校、卽附設於工藝學院中、惟女子職業學校、尚多分設者、</p>
<p>工業學校、爲倫敦市政委員會設立者、多爲專科性質、如印刷學校、建築學校等、然亦有多科者、管理權均在市政委員會、而一部分之行政職務、則由市府教育委員會委派每校之顧問委員會、負責辦理之、</p>
<p>補習學校　補習教育、可分爲二類、其一類爲職業學科之補習、其另一類爲普通教育之補習、其學科程度、高低頗不一律、職業補習學科、爲英國現行職業教育制度中、最重要之工作、凡工業學校之高級班及專門班、均包括在内、此項學科、以夜班教授爲多、惟工程及建築業、有時許其雇用人員、在日間上課者、但尚居少數耳、普通補習學科、分日班夜班二種、爲雇員工人、繼續小學畢業、補育並通常識而設、</p>
<p>國家憑證考試　英國職業教育中、最特殊之一點、而爲歐洲大陸各國所無者、卽爲各級國家憑證考試是也、此項考試分二類、第一類爲證書考試、第二類爲文憑考試、而各類中又别爲高級與專門二種、此項證書及文憑考試、均須在工藝學院或職業學校、修習功課三年或二年、方得參與、而證書及文憑授予之權、則操諸教育部及工程師學會、例如某工藝學院、設立機械工程證書科時、必須先將是項計劃、呈請教育部、及機械工程師學會、由二機關詳加考查、如機械儀器、設備充實、教員經騐合格、課程與教材相當、則方准許設立是科、其他若電機工程、化學工程等、證書或文憑科設立時、亦須經過同様手續、現在已准設立者、有五種、爲機械工程、電機工和琥造船工程、化學工程、建築工程等、經教育部、及五種工程師學會、共同審定合格者、</p>
<p>各科課程、分補習班、及專修班二種、每科課目、均預爲規定、稱爲聯合課目、例如普通工程科、則以機械製圖、應用力學、數學等各門、合爲聯合課目、如爲電機工程、則以電機原理、數學、力學、機械製圖、電機設計、電力交通等各門、爲聯合課目、其他化學機械等科之聯合課目、其組織分配、大略相似、其爲補習班者、教材略簡、稱爲補習聯合課目、其爲專修班者、程度較高、稱爲專修聯合課目、凡習補習班者、祇給證書、習專修科者、得給文憑、證書與文憑、各分普通與高等二種、凡學生入學、已及十四歲或十五歲、或曾在初級職業學校、補習在二年以上者、得入高級補習班、學程三年、每年至少須授課一百五十小時、（化學工程科、規定至少限度、爲每年一百八十小時、）每星期有晚課三次、畢業考試及格、得給普通證書、學生年齡較高、程度較優、習專門補習班者、學程二年、畢業考試及格、則給高級證書、</p>
<p>凡習專修班者、若人高級專修班、則畢業後、給普通文憑、入專門專修班、則給高級文憑、其學程年限、至少爲三年、（化學工程師學會、至今只給證書、不給文憑、因學生成績結果、不良故也、）</p>

<p>棉市大落、跌風益熾、以上年漲勢愈烈、多數預料休假中外棉將續上升、在此假期内、美棉未動、而印棉略升三·四羅比、但匯兌放升、採算價每担較上年跌一元外、於是人心衰弱、甬帮多頭出籠二萬担、但大量的多頭意態仍堅、不過外棉仍無破綻也云、</p>
<h3>鄭標猛跌元外</h3>

<h3>標粉不住地下瀉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致均見暴落之象、以停市十餘日後、洋麥報價、雖無巨大上落步過加内之實銷胃口、依然不振、如前月分大户多頭收去之紛、多數尚擺在乎中、而本月份又屬平月、屈計正式交易、不滿十天、所有期貨、例須了結、兼之阿根庭現貨洋麥、報價已鬆、祇喊四元一角半、故開價後、市氣卽不見穩、旋以福新阜豐等廠、均有應酬抛賣、市况又復步步下游、新多頭旣少、老多頭又有回出、跌勢故愈狂也、結果本月份粉停市前跌三分半、三月份跌四分、四月份跌三分半、五月份跌三分、六月份跌二分半、七月份跌三分二厘半、</p>
<h3>新麥標準有三元進關勢</h3>
<p>丨受米價影響丨</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、近期因買賣兩寂、見交甚少、三月份祇上午做開、價四元零二三分、較停市前、跌八九分左右、六月份上下午均開三元七角五六分、亦落八九分左右、至七月份新貨、則因抛户大盛、半以天時甚佳、半以阿根庭現貨之奇廉、故人心一致虚軟、跌勢大盛、較停市前跌一角二分之巨、據業中人推測、以米價之低宜、新標準恐三元進關、亦未可知、現麥因公會無市、只包未開云、</p>
<h3>米市紅盤大見起色</h3>
<p>（滬南）紅盤情况、各帮來源於客歲大結束後、其陸續抵埠者共有船頭一百三十餘號、（一萬六千餘石）其中以各帮厚粳居多、晚稻及各花色相佔半數、各路銷塲、當此歲首紅盤、殊頗熱閙、各帮包胃不能暢辦、紅盤開出、殊較客歲勝色、如常帮蘇同帮南港等厚粳加起角半、青角松泗西練等晚稻各升尺奇、惟杜埠尖及各花色略較參差、上升一二角數分不等耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）春假休業八天期滿、河下存船及到貨共六七十號、各貨銷胃均係應酬、故甚清淡、開盤各價較收盤加角外、白粳薄稻價加角外、羊埠尖加二角、客尖加近角、陰元白元平定、</p>
<h3>各帮對客秈交易之態茺</h3>
<p>▲洋客秈改一百八十市斤爲一擔</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈紅盤市面、並無十分興旺氣景、因本客各帮均存謹愼、不願放膽賣買、且銀錢業開户有待、鈒根尚未流通、泉州帮本有辦胃、因匯兌與銀根之關係、昨日竟無動靜、福州帮稍有應酬、但並不十分動、且在去冬已經裝出數萬包、目下該地需要已足、寗波帮消口本旺、但其在去冬年底裝去洋米客秈三萬五千包、目下已無需要、故昨祇本街與閩省垣帮共去二千包稍零、客秈存底甚豐、但貨主因成本高昻、洋米已實行加稅、閩省徵稅亦在日内實行、故不欲輕脫、所以交易雖少、市面仍居挺俏、洋米之小絞則比去冬漲起五分、卽洋米徵稅原因也、閩省帮計去湖南　油二百四十二包、價七元半、糙油六百包、價六元三角、明光秈七百五十包、價六元八角半至六元七角、南京柳秈糙一百五十五包、價六元一角、本街去江西紅晚七十六包價七元一角、湖南機油一百包、價七元半、　靖一百包、價六元三角、京糙一百五十包、價五元五角三分、小絞二百包係回籠貨、價六元八角半越</p>
<p>自本市實行新衡量後、河下米早已改用市斛、洋客秈因海關報運關係、迄未改換、現以海關已經遵改、糧業已奉到市社會局指令更改、故自昨日起、洋客秈每擔三律改爲市秤一百八十斤、但以舊例核算、仍爲相等也、</p>
<h3>雜糧乏上漲力量</h3>
<p>雜糧現貨昨已正式開盤、市價均合整市秤而沽、紅盤交易尚佳、但市况仍乏上漲力量、昨黄豆有福州帮及本街交易、廠方不動、統市成交車輪各豆十三四車、市價高平次定、青豆乃花色貨、市况尚無帶辱、昨由内地採辦歸德青豆七百包、本街去大連夾青二百五十包、沙黄杜豆平平而已、蠶豆則開寗波貨六七百包、爲福州帮及洋莊之胃、市價頗穩、菉豆廣帮小吕宋帮厦門帮均有問津、全市成交明毛各菉一千七八百包、市形暫居穩定、芝蔴市價無大變遷、廣帮辦去白蔴七百餘包、厦門帮採去黑蔴四十二包、生仁依然較花生爲弱、</p>
<h3>油市　油餅紅盤不振</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油紅盤市况、因收盤時、各行家手中均有存積、且各地銷户尚未上市、故昨日成交各貨、多爲應酬交易、市價比收盤時須跌二三角不等、豆餅跌勢更厲、較收盤市面足有五分之差、原因内地尚未問訊、至出口復受直運打擊、市况不振云、</p>
<h3>南北貨金針菜紅盤突漲二元</h3>
<p>丨黑棗胡桃亦趨上升丨</p>
<p>金針菜以行號存底均薄、且鎭江各盤未開、故上海號貨亦遂扳住、聞昨初盤交易祇開百數包、價如大興菜十九元八角、鄉莊菜十八元八角、比較春節前漲起二元有奇、照此局勢後市尚看提升、行方鑒於各帮銷路之靈活、亦然緊手云、黑棗胡桃因來源久稀、申底亦告寥寥、故行盤均漲、如手揀桃二十元、石門桃十八元五角、昌平桃十八元、羊谷桃十七元、高莊元棗自十五元至十八元、統乎黑棗十一元至十二元、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白回跌五分</h3>
<p>丨五福文冰漲二三角丨</p>
<p>昨糖市因金價轉跌、公會劃盤如二四粗砂白回小五分、爲十九元九角五分、成交仍稀、轉口高普通貨六元八角、九號荷赤十五元九角五分、八九號荷赤十五元七角、潮青以各帮銷路未動、故上擋未開、祇開出隆江青百餘包、價十元零五角至十元零六角、棉湖赤開三百餘包、價十四元七角、棉白開數十包、價二十元零五角、枝洋十六元零五分、本廠白跌一角、爲十九元一角、建冰號盤祇大來華號開出五福文冰百餘箱、價每砠爲十八元三角、比春節前漲二三角、海南赤片青則尚未成盤、</p>
<h3>疋頭德記呢絨紅盤報漲</h3>
<p>呢絨絨盤、昨德記貨、華孚泰首先開出、較之一月份平均上漲二角之譜、然其他同業紅盤開價、大多數與去年無甚出入、統觀會上市氣、元直貢呢及元常黄灰素色華達呢兩種以缺較俏、嗶嘰條子夾色華達呢等日貨充斥、紅盤開價略底、將後變化、須此後去路爲轉移耳、（德記元直貢呢紅盤價目見市價欄内）</p>

<h3>預言</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>現在，是連中國人也相信這個世界不能不變的了，因爲相信要變，便想知道將變成如何，所以大家都愛聽預言。許多雜誌社，於是特别出了題目，請人作預言。但他們所請的全是些專門做文章的人，說得好聽說，是知識分子。</p>
<p>作預言的本來專門有一種人，中國有星相家，外國也有所謂預言家。他們所憑的是「天意」或者「靈感」。但現代人已不大相信他們。現代人所相信的是知識分子的預言，因爲他們根據客觀的事勢作綜合的考察，然後從旣成的「因」推斷必然的「果」，如此較富於科學性，所以大家都相信他們，而他們也就很的把握似的下推測了。</p>
<p>然而，知識分子的預言，仍然很少凖確性。因爲知識分子的觀察能由和推理能力，根本受着種種的限制。譬如一個資產階級的知識分子的觀察，只能詳於資產階級的事勢，也也的推斷，也只是站在資產階級的立塲而出發，對於别階級的事勢和命運，必然忽視。像這様的預言，不消說是不很可靠的。</p>
<p>而且，知識分子根據科學方法而行推斷，他的論證和推理無論怎様嚴密鄭重，總不能逃出漸變的觀念，倘若社會的變化也永遠是漸變的，那麽知識分子的預言或可倖中。然而，社會的變化，其實常常是突變的，這突變並非無「因」，但是牠的「因」的存在，本來是根隱晦，不易被一般人所看出。一般人只看見一些顯在的「因」，憑此而推斷未來的「果」，殊不知未來的「果」却常被潛在的「因」所决定，出乎預言家的意料之外。</p>
<p>譬如說到世界第二次大戰，一般預言家都以爲一九三六年就要發生。但是發生了之後怎麽様呢？預言家們就說不明白，除了轟炸機怎様毁滅都市，毒瓦斯如何收拾入命這些想像之外，别的結果一點也想不到。這様的預言，很使大衆絶望，因而養成聽天由命的消極觀念。另一方面，則使一般陷於世紀末的病態的人們預感大剌激的興奮，轉而促成戰爭的實現。這種預言是貽害很大的。　　世界戰爭固然是一種毁滅的危機，但若一旦在世界的大衆中間偶然爆發了一種力量，未始不可以轉危爲安，而且使之成爲新生的轉機。或以爲「偶然」實太杳茫，殊不知歷史的發展中，本無所謂偶然，偶然者，只是我們未嘗看到的必然而已。而且，造成歷史的是大衆，過去因大衆的渾沌使黑暗歷久，將來因大衆的覺醒，必能使光明突現。而大衆的覺醒，並非無望之事，故對於當今的預言家們所張皇的危機，我們也無須絶望。</p>
<h3>海外遥寄詩魂</h3>
<p>— 羅皚嵐</p>
<p>——悼朱湘</p>
<p>子沅，今早在哥侖比亞中文圖書館中讀報，無意中讀到你投揚子江自殺的消息。子沅，你眞的不在人間了嗎？還是我在做夢？但報上的字一個一個地活現着，陽光照滿了室中，這那能是夢？</p>
<p>從報上寥寥的百餘字中，看出你自殺的原因，是因爲窮。嗚呼，子沅，你應明瞭，社會根本容納不住詩人，羣衆是謀害天才的劊子手，你不幸爲詩人，更不幸爲天才的詩人，你卽不自殺，社會與羣衆也會要殺害你的。</p>
<p>有人要說你的自殺，乃儒弱者的行爲，此人根本便不懂得你，祇是隨人瞎說。向使你是弱者，你會委屈求生，你會摇尾乞憐，决不致爲藝術與眞理，去打倒囗囗大偶像，用厠所的草紙寫信去痛責紅極一時的囗囗大編輯。要是你不得罪這些學術界權威，文壇健將，及其大小　囉，你此時也許坐擁臯比，當甚麽大學的院長或主任之類了。然而，你不，你情願窮，情願自殺，没有勇氣的人，能這様幹嗎？</p>
<p>子沅，社會雖虐待了詩人，但詩人的作品却長留在人世，你的軀壳也許隨着大江的浪花永遠消逝了，但你的完整的人格却長留大朋友的心中，你的詩文將永放光茫，如日月之永恒不滅。子沅，想到這裏，你該含笑九泉了吧！</p>
<p>然而，你之死，在反朋中失去了一個良伴，詩壇上殞滅了一顆明星，這悲哀是永難排除，這損失是永難彌補的。</p>
<p>天才不世出，天才能自愛，能努力，能對藝術忠實的，尤不多見。子沅，你已長眠了，你們尚有何可說！</p>
<h3>翻譯與介紹</h3>
<p>— 任白戈</p>
<p>我一向是這様地想：與其東抄西襲，凑成一篇所謂創作的論文，到不如老老實實地將原著分别翻譯出來以盡其介紹的責任。自然，這中間並没有貶薄創作的意思。其實，抄襲亦可以說是介紹，也許對於那些只圖好看易消的人反轉較爲合味點吧。然而，在一個眞是爲了學問的人，說不一定將會不客氣地說：這是不可以的。</p>
<p>畢竟因爲能够不客氣地說的人太少了，所以這種風氣還在一直流行着。由部分的抄襲到全文的割竊，這本來已經很可觀了，而近來却更產生出許多的變種：有的是採取了評點古書的辦法，將别人底文章一段一段地抄去，在尾巴上加上一點也可算是自已底意見的評語，作爲一篇文章：有的是抄譯全文，將自已底名字放在著者底地位，而將原著者底名字趕到文章底屁股後面去躱着。這，比較那些一味抄襲和割竊的，自然是高明得多了，主要的高明就在這里還留着一條自以爲很安全的退路。</p>
<p>據說，在西洋，翻譯名著，往往不署譯者底名，爲的是原著者底地位才不至被譯者所奪。從此可知這種幹法，大約還是「外」「古」所罕見，而爲「中」「今」所獨有的。它底價值和命運，我想誰也得知，用不着我多說了吧。</p>
<p>不過，這里却又留下了一個　我們所不能忽略的問題：像西洋那様不署譯者底名是萬萬不可以行的。理由很簡單，用一句古話來說，就是「有伊　之志則可，無伊尹之志則纂也」。譬如說，前幾年，翻譯之風曾經盛行過一時，隨着市塲上就出了一批無人負責或又似乎是許多人負責的拙劣譯品。聽說，那是爲了怕人搶先而由幾個人合夥趕　出來的東西，結果大家都不敢負責任，只得不用名字或另取幾個假名發表。這様的翻譯，自然是會將好的東西也夾着拖到泥坑裏去的，所以終於是將整個翻譯界斷送了。「悟已往之不諫，知來者之可追」，中國文化界還能再遭一次這様的厄難和損失嗎？</p>
<p>現在，因爲說話更不容易，往往許多意見都得從别人底口裏借路出來才行，已經又有許多人在提議接受文學的遺產了，也許在不久的將來翻譯又會抬起頭來的。不過，我首先就希望它不僅是作了一個應時卽景的文章，而且成爲一個偉大的工作底開始。更進一步說，就是要由「忠實地介紹」，「系统地介紹」，「批判地介紹」而產生出許多眞實有力的東西。要這様，才能說得上是眞正在接受「遺產」。</p>
<p>一個民族之能否好好地接受前進的文化，正等於一個人之能否聽取善言一様，這是可以决定它底命運和前途的。我們到底是讓自已滅亡還是生長呢？</p>
<h3>誕生</h3>
<p>— 秀湖</p>
<p>這天他的日記這様寫道：——</p>
<p>×月×日　早上五點光景，清冷的馬路上，有一男一女，慢慢地前進。女的呌着腹痛，男的扶着她站住了，不久又慢慢地向前走着，兩人輕輕地說着話，有時還露出笑聲。那就是我和金貞。金貞在三點鐘就發作，將要分娩了，近邊没有汽車，夜深了，也看不見一張黄包車，祇好挾着她一面走一面等車，送她到醫院去。</p>
<p>下午兩點鐘的時候，紅十字醫院第二號生產室門外，有一個男子，穿着醫生用的白色外套，頭上還戴着一個白頭巾，在那裏焦惶地站着，轉着，時時向門縫裏偷覷。那就是我。</p>
<p>慘厲的呼聲，從生產室傳出來，眞使我焦惶無地。但這聲音不久就寂然了，我向門縫裏一張，看見她的頭歪斜地躺在手術榻上，面上蓋着一片紗布。醫生正在旁邊用刀义施着手術，大約她已受了麻醉，暈過去了。我想起剛纔自已在室内親眼看見她宛轉痛楚的情形來，還不覺股慄。</p>
<p>人生的產苦，平常雖然聽到很多，然而要不是身受目覩，怎麽能眞實的感覺到呢？記得日本的廚川白村把新時代的產生比作人生的產苦。前者是人類生存的鬥爭，而後者是人類延續生命的掙扎。兩者在人生的意義上是有同様的價值的。也同様的是一種艱苦的鬭爭。然而一個爲時代而爭鬭的英雄，往往爲全人類所曾　，而　　了人生艱鉅的一半的女性，却至今還在壓迫之下，不爲人所關心，是爲什麽呢？</p>
<p>倘使說人類創造了他自已的歷史，那麽在創造的功勞簿上，女性是單獨的負担了一半歷史的重任的因爲她們生產了繼續這歷史創造的人。</p>
<p>二點五十分，孩子降生了。我從門縫裏看見醫生正倒提着一個灰白的孩子。身上還有從母體内帶出來的血痕，我不覺暈倒了，扶住門框，不住的戰慄。這就是一個孩子，一個從我和她身上分出來的血肉麽？就好像我從來没有想到過似的，我們中間，會有這麽一個新的生命，出現到我的眼前。</p>
<p>我立時醒悟：這是我的孩子，我如今是父親了。我立刻發生了愛他的心。是的，我要愛護他，我要更努力，爲他的幸福，爲全人類的幸福。他應當成爲社會上最完全的分子。因爲他是一個新時代的孩已，他所負的歷史的使命比我更大更遠。我和金貞生產了他，在他的手上，要生產新的時代。</p>
<p>孩子啼哭了，這是他降生到人間發出來的第一次聲音。我忙去看了鐘，是二點五十分鐘。</p>
<p>我從扶梯口回到上產室的門前，經過一間病房，那房中圍滿了人，有人在哭着。那裏面有一個病人剛斷了氣，死了。世界上在同一分鐘内，生了一個人，也死了一個人。醫院眞是一個生命的界綫，有人在這裏生，也有人在這裏死。人類的新陳代謝的鐵律，就在這一條綫上演着。我的孩子是代表新的，而那人是代表舊的。</p>
<p>在生產室門口，遇見接生的看護，她告訴我，生的是一個「妹妹」。我不禁立刻想道：「若干年後，她也要像她的母親一様，也許就躺在這同一房中，同一榻上，生產着她更後一代的人。」</p>
<p>世界是一條河流，而人生就是那中間的流水。這孩子正開始像流着的水似的，如今到世界上來了。</p>
<h3>我詛咒你那麽一笑（六）</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>「眞怪了！他向我要女人。……我有什麽女人！……我又不是開窰子的！……」</p>
<p>「他們就是要那些擺夷女子囉。……」</p>
<p>老板用嘴巴往那些客人睡覺的房間一指，輕聲地說，做出很懂事的様兒。隨卽補了一句，意思是呌我識相一點兒，莫要在貴客的面前現出那麽不好看的嘴臉。</p>
<p>「不好得罪的哪，……這是八募官家派來查路的人。……在這裏開店子，唉，眞是……」</p>
<p>不再往下說了，苦惱地嘆口氣。</p>
<p>我按下了忿怒，稍微放軟聲音說：</p>
<p>「是不是呌我引他去找一個……」</p>
<p>老板點點頭。</p>
<p>我却很生反感的說：</p>
<p>「這様的事，我不會做，不會，不會，不會，……我又不懂擺夷話，……呌老板娘不好嗎？」</p>
<p>最後一句話，簡直是硬着頭皮說的。</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯，這是什麽話！什麽話！……」</p>
<p>老板立卽大發脾氣了。就把外國人手裏的電筒抓着，口吃地說：</p>
<p>「來，來，……大人，我，我引你去，我引你去。」</p>
<p>馬上一個悲痛的意識，子彈也似地打進我的心頭；難道竟眼睜睜地望着那些可憐的夷家少女，讓人活活作踐麽？看看睡着的印度人，全不說什麽話，只是閉起眼睛，擺着青色的下巴，他也像我的老板似地，陷到無可如何的境地了。</p>
<p>都是没用的傢伙！我心裏惡毒地駡着，同時，燃起了憤恨的火焰了。這打掃馬糞的，侍候客人的倒楣事情，也不想再做了，今晚上痛痛快快地揍那洋鬼子一頓，當夜或者明早就跑回中國去。但想到把禍事丢給這家子和那印度人，又覺不忍。而且又使我那三個可憐的小學生，弄到老虎的嘴上去，却更令我心上不好過。因爲他們太天眞了，從不曾把我當成小夥計一様地看待過，總是　對先生那般地敬愛着。然而，閉着眼睛讓那些在生活上辛苦奔波的夷家少女給人蹂躪麽？這於我，又是不可能的！絶對不能够！於是，我突然同老板和那洋鬼子追去了。</p>
<p>但並没有揮起拳頭，却只把老板手裏的電筒抓着，急促地說道：</p>
<p>「還是我來好了！」</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯，……」</p>
<p>老板依舊現着大不滿意的様子，但也不說什麽話，就把手電筒交給我，很快地便抽身轉去，那様子，宛发是在說，倘若和那些擺夷姑娘弄不上手而又閙起來了的話，那是不關我的事的因爲這是你自已甘願做的哪。</p>
<p>於是，這一件丢臉的不愉快的工作，便全放在我的肩上了。但我這時的心上，却非常地平靜，因爲應付道事的計劃，已經一下子佈置在腦子裏了。走到那些擺夷少女睡的房間門口，我驀地站住了，立在洋鬼子的面前，靜靜地問：</p>
<p>「Ｗhat　do　you　wantp？」</p>
<p>意思是想使他小小生點氣，故意裝做不懂的神情。</p>
<p>「Ｉ　want　a　girl—deauful　girlo」</p>

<h3>馬路英雄</h3>
<p>— 黛妮</p>
<p>無無年卅夜愁眉苦臉，大年初一總得摇摇擺擺跑出來消遥自自，不然，似乎對不起這一年一度的元旦佳日（現在據說有二度了）。自已除夕夜没有提燈籠的人上門，年初一自然更比衆不同，城隍廟里頭香不燒，瞧瞧新年氣象，是不能不應個景兒的。抱着又加增了一歲的心，像一個老年人似的跑出門來，我自信態度很悠然自得，可是「拍」的一聲在背後把我一驚，回顧頭去，幾個已在小孩子以上年齡的大孩子，哄的一聲大笑。是的，金錢砲，年卅夜從債務里硬扣下來的幾枚銅元，壓一塲牌九不够，貢幾個金錢砲是再經濟不過的，何况嚇了人家，就是一種損人不利已的娛樂方法。我記不起我小時候來，不知曾否把壓歲錢這般浪費過，不，消遣過。現在因爲自以爲是一個老年人，而且是在大年初一，多少應得討一點吉利，推出門來就相駡倒底不脫年少氣盛，所以也放寛了喉嚨，大笑起來，然而他們似乎不預科老年人有這般態度的，第二個金錢砲，就施在一個年輕女子的身上了。跑了一段路，這舉動到處皆是，眞不愧年初一的一派新年氣象也。要是我没有這點老勁，恐怕也要買幾個來取取樂；然而倒底不好意思，僅站在一個擺攤旁做個冷眼旁觀者，祇要他們笑的時候，我跟着笑，不是經濟中的更經濟辦法嗎！站在馬路中心的警察，我知道他也童心未泯，瞧着受驚女人的花容失色，他拉開了山東大嘴得意地笑起來。自然，今天的黄包車夫是皇恩大赦日，過馬路可以不照路章，小轉灣更是不妨。那警察老爺没有平時的慢爺面孔，他跑到攤上來也抓了幾個金錢砲向年輕女子開開玩笑，那被受者似乎駡「殺千刀」也没有勇氣，警察老爺現在已是馬路英雄，對於英雄的行爲，當然没有指摘的可能！我這老年人不知還有多少大年初一可過，每年來參加這盛大的擲砲典禮，倒是也是延年益壽的方法哩！</p>
<h3>父親</h3>
<p>— 襲人</p>
<p>六歲時死了父親，父親對於我的影像是那様模糊，雖能在遺像上認識父親的容貌，他是年青，没有鬚。我們小孩子時候學大人像，一定撫摸着上唇，並且乾咳一聲，以爲做大人應敢這様。這種小孩子的心理直至我長大了。</p>
<p>離别故鄉三年，父親還是那様年青，没有鬚。而父親的兒子却已很蒼老，自已摸撫鬚子時，手指微微感到剌痛。我記起了結婚時祖母說的話：「窮人没有錢，傳宗接代是一様的，你也該生個兒子使我歡喜歡喜。」於是她老人家惜了債給我成婚。現在我也將做孩子的父親了，她老人家果然歡喜，我望着父親的遺像，想到那年青的人是生了我而脫離世界的，我做了父親之後，不知怎様，而且還較父親多生了剌痛手的鬚子。　　每一個女人的心理，希望自已的兒子早些結婚，生一個孫兒抱抱。祖母因爲父親不壽，她抱了我這孫兒，却損失了兒子，所以她在我身上希望抱一個曾孫補缺。老人家的愛心是不可磨滅的，我見了她銀絲般的頭髮，立地想歸家去待奉他，使那様老年人獨自孤居在一所破而且太的空屋子裏。但是她要我結婚，我爲了生活飄流到上海來了，已經三年，額上波起了皺紋，剌痛手指的鬚子，他的孫兒雖然衰老得這様快，但是將要有一個孩子使她歡喜。我寫信告訴妻子懷孕，她寫信要我妻子歸去，說你們年青不知厲害，不要硬爭面子，勞働的事不可多做。姑夫上海來，她或也來看看我，女人家確是喜歡她們的兒子孫子，就是我的妻也在計劃孩子的什麽什麽了；不過我也不能否認我自已也喜歡小孩子的。我的喜歡小孩子，是小孩子該使人歡喜，不能因爲自已喜歡小孩子，就一定要個小孩子歡喜，做父親的人，是没有她們那様樂意。</p>
<p>我望着父親遺像，他是年青，没有有鬚。</p>
<h3>落葉</h3>
<p>— 麟年</p>
<p>世界上做戇大的人越多，做事的效力越大，因爲祇有戇大才能埋頭苦幹。　　我希望發明家發明一具照自已的Ｘ光鏡，可以看看自已的罪惡。</p>
<p>娶了個虚榮的妻子，是家庭失和的主角。</p>
<p>理智把情感克服了後，就覺得自已非常偉大，勇敢。</p>
<p>金子之所以可貴，並不是在牠本身上，還是在你的心理上。</p>
<p>物質的祇能維持一時，精神的才能永久，不論一切都然。</p>
<p>女婿和媳婦都是外人，但是做岳母的大都愛女婿，而做婆婆的總痛恨媳婦。</p>
<p>幸運是一個盲目者，他不認識你，但是他有時會捉摸着你。</p>
<p>最大的損失，莫如喪失了名譽而換來的利益。</p>
<p>喜閒談的人，他的說謊的程度，一定較任何人爲高明。</p>
<p>一雙手，抵不住幾張嘴：一枝筆，寫不盡許多話。</p>
<p>站在燈光前，雖然在面前覺得光明，但你的後面却有了一個黑影，所以禍福總是相聯的。</p>
<p>你不要看輕衣衫檻褸的乞丐是卑鄙的，要知道他們以前的生活要比你現在生活也許舒服得多。</p>
<p>糞夫的職業是極高尚的，一方爲大衆服務，一方爲自已謀生。</p>
<p>虚壞若谷的人，最難摸他的才能學識及一切。</p>
<p>關了門打狗，狗會與你拚命，燒熱了湯殺猪，猪會狂壕幾聲。當你走進了逐境要是不掙扎而甘願消沈的話，還不及一隻狗一隻猪。</p>
<h3>馬路小景</h3>
<p>— 禱</p>
<p>從薩坡賽路走來，後面跟着一個人，「先生，先生！」地喊着，回頭一看，原來是一個穿灰色軍服的丘八同胞。我站住看了他一下，他誠懇地說：「先生，請問一聲到龍華從那裏走，」却是問路的。「回頭一直走，出了租界，再問人，路遠呢。」我回答了以後，預備走路，那人却一鞠躬，笑容滿面地又說，「先生，我是被隊伍遣散的人，要回家路費都没有，帮帮忙。」要錢！我心裏一怔，他又說，「我本來是在家裏種田的，後來才當兵吃餉，莊稼人家因爲要爭氣呀……先生，你曉得，現在要回家没有路費。」我自已有事，不能等他多說，給他幾個銅板走我的路，他還在後面跟着「先生，多給一些，我不隨便向人要錢的，」又給他幾個銅板，「鈎了，鈎了，我也是窮人没有錢的，找别人要去。」說着拔步就跑，他回頭向另外一人懇求去了，我這才放了心。不料脚步才放慢些，又聽到「老爺喲，没有飯吃，給兩個銅板。」是一個窮婦人，手中抱着一個嬰孩，心想我不是老爺，可以不管，走我的路，不料跟上一個小孩子，還是「老爺喲，没有飯吃……」地呌，爲了省麻煩，給了兩個銅板。那小孩子看見對馬路走着一位太太，不管汽車嗚嗚地警告，他搶在汽車前面跑過馬路去了，我不禁停步要喊出，「汽車，不要過去！」但已經來不及。那汽車剌的一聲停止，汽車夫駡道「小猪鑼！」看車裏坐的是一位貴婦人和一個小寶寶。心裏看了這一種對照的貧富不同的母與子的情境，起了一陣小小的風浪，這風浪使我的心裏有點不很平靜。可是，我有事，走我的路。</p>

<h3>讀書與出路</h3>
<p>— 建設</p>
<p>在學校中，眞是像在天國般的快樂。什麽都不要思慮，什麽都不要計算。祗在家中没錢來的時候，便患着一些時的窮困。然而那不過是暫時的，並且根本就不影響及吃飯問題。一擠出學校，便眞像從天國的樂園中跌落進了十八層地獄。從前一點不要思慮的事，現在要一一地思慮起來，從前那種舒適恬靜的生涯，無論怎様都像隔着一層幕布似的了。横梗在當前的就是一個職業問題。　　平日受着讀書做官的教育，以及家長的讀書做官的心理，雖然怎様說都是種難堪的企圖。但是處在這種社會制度下的人們，却又不能不是這般說法。我是反對這種教育的根本精神的。但我目前却又不能不設法解决我的職業問題，因爲反對是一問題，而職業又是另一問題。</p>
<p>雖然說横賴在家中，未嘗不會繼續的受着蓄養。但到底只是種蓄養而已。並且這根本就易致家庭的感情於乖離，而一種深重的良心譴責也必會由此而起。爲甚麽我們要如此淪落呢？</p>
<p>可是一說到職業問題，我却又不能不呆然地怔住了。我怎麽可以解决這職業問題呢？我是個學社會學的人。一個學社會學的人應該是做甚麽好呢？</p>
<p>爲着這一類的問題，無論怎様擺得脫的人，總也禁不住焦灼。在一般社會的成見說起來，有　多只受　　　教育的人倒是一個個的高官厚祿，　　，　算在大學裏混過，那麽，更要優裕了。但是事實却怎様也不這様輕鬆。事實擺在這兒，好像是受過高等教育，受過專門教育的人，反而是找不着職業似的。這種事實的鐵證，是否是說社會不需要這種受過高等教育的人，抑還是受過高等教育的人不配找職業？</p>
<p>教育的精神是做官的，然而教育的結果却是無官可做。無官可做倒也罷了，祇是找一個噉飯的地方也没有，却不免令人懊然。生活是必要生活的，但是我到底向那裏去找我企求的出路呢？</p>
<p>學政治的出路固然是做官，而學工程，學機械，學美術，學文藝，學商科，學教育，學醫學的出路也是做官：在現在竟不學一點什麽的人的出路，也是做官了。官有限而做者無窮，我們將怎様來解决我們的生活呢？</p>
<p>想着想着，便又只是煩惱。一向我就只是煩惱不休。我也這兒那兒的走訪了無數的朋友，他們大都也是一様的怔然。職業的威脅都赫然的臨在我們的頭上。你們的這一羣呵！</p>

<h3>不願完婚</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一件很困難的事，現在特來向你求教，希望你爲我想個辦法，因我對此事　分　　。你接此　後，最好請你卽速　　　　。</p>
<p>敝人在童年時由家長作主，與乙女訂立婚約。民二十一年敝人知識稍長，曾數次對家長提出抗議，但總置之不理；直至去年年底敝人家長忽將俗禮所謂日子（卽結婚日期）送與對方，定今年四月爲敝人完婚。敝人抱定宗旨不結婚，决意要解除婚約，可是敝家長却十分頑固，對於解除婚約始終不願，又因乙女的家長和敝家長是表親，時常在一起，自此感情很好。我和乙女也常遇見，經過數次談話後，覺得乙女旣無學問，智識又很簡單，我曾要求她入學校求學，她亦置不聞。現在我是决意要解除婚約，雖未得家長的同意，我爲我終身幸福計，祗得自已提議。但是我却又未成年，不能提出解約，我預備我自已直接向乙女提出此事，似乎很有希望，這様做對不對？請你指導我。還有（在解約後）對方是否可以向我方要求任何損害賠償？我現在以何種態度對敝家長？將來解約後，以何種態度對敝家長？最後我須告訴你，我現在祇有十九歲尚在高中二年級肄業，根本就不應該結婚，總之，這是我最後的掙扎，努力，奮鬭，失敗後惟有自殺，以上的一切懇求你能從速答覆我，我是非常地感激。</p>
<p>李思勤謹上</p>
<p>編者按，關於解除由家長訂立的婚約，本信箱已發表了不少，現在李君又提出未成年人解除婚約問題，這也是應當討論的。</p>
<p>結婚與婚約是兩件事：結婚是婚約的履行，所以不一去履行父母作主的婚約，解除婚約固是直截了當的手段，但是在不能使用這種辦法時，「不履行婚約」丨卽不結婚郤也是一個正當有效的辦法。因爲婚約的履行應視婚約之是否合法，（十九年上字第三五號判决要旨）而解除婚約則在法律上規定成年後始得訴請解除。而且「父母爲子女訂立之婚約，苟有一造不願履行，依法卽難强制。一所以你因爲結婚日期很近，就急急乎要解除婚約，是大可不必的，你「不履行」好了，不過，你直接與「乙女提出解約」倒是一個辦法，因爲婚約本應由當事人雙方自主啊！</p>
<p>至於對待貴家長的態度，我們以爲，你是用不着另換一副面目的。你還是照舊好了，因爲不滿父母作主的婚約，並非對父母不滿；而且父母爲子女訂婚，也是一番好意，儘管我們不願履行，但懷恨是斷斷不可以的，所以，你在解約或不履行婚約後應當極誠懇地把你的理由原原本本講給家長聽，就是他們不高興，你也不要厭煩。</p>
<p>損害賠償要由具體情形决定，照你</p>
<p>情形，大　是没有什麽大了不得的「請求」的。</p>

<p>「有個吧草字頭吧？」</p>
<p>「雖不，也不遠了。老板們也都不敢做生意了。倒是你們的生意好。」</p>
<p>「也不行囉。人家又多，擔負又重，利錢也就說不上了，」</p>
<p>拿着小學徒們包好了的糖食包，和張朝俸告辭過的徐三·又打着燈籠走上街，聽到街那頭在放爆仗，辟辟拍拍點綴着這冷靜的舊歷新年的氣象。</p>
<p>街上是安靜鄉，有一個人笑，便有九個人嘆氣。徐三低着頭，避免把脚端到雪水窪裏去，想着今年如何可以使「運命」轉機。他也知道生路窄，他知道生產的生活的門是閉着的了。像許多别人一様，他聽到什麽司令和什麽司令打仗時，便高興注意那位英雄殺人最多。大水災的降臨，他認爲是天意。日本人攻山海關，他相信是「陰陽書」在五百年前就注定的。他相信一切是定命的。他却希望他不是命定了長遠如此貧困。</p>
<p>他頸子一直縮到他的脚踏進賭塲時才伸了出來。門外的情調是凄凉的，門裏是熱鬧與喧　。許多人影子在墻上幌，許多聲音織成了嘒噪的漩流。</p>

<p>蘇八說，「還不是眼紅了，熱在我們這裏。一塲賭要給十五吊錢一天，就　　是五塊，一百五十塊錢一月也算對此公安局了。這様加下去也不是事。」</p>
<p>嘴裏咬着交切的曹先生招呼他們也拈一點，大家應許着，却不動手。</p>
<p>長發抱着曲起的膝磕骨，說，「河北街的賭已經到了十八吊一天了，六塊錢！」</p>
<p>從鼻孔與口裏冒出滾滾灰色烟氣的趙營賬，放下烟槍，欠起身體，呷了一口茶，揀起一個寸金，在手裏，對着燈光慢騰騰地說，</p>
<p>「燈捐又要加半塊錢一盞了，衙間又支起來了。」</p>
<p>「上次說是禁，好，三塊錢一盞燈吧，」蘇八說，「現在又正式設了衙門，那麽說起來，生意更外難做了。」</p>
<p>徐三不作聲，聽他們說，心想燈捐加價後，能不能把烟泡加兩個銅板一個。</p>
<p>「誰不是這様講。現在許多人家談都自已備了。就是連同泰那様的店，去請　的時候，也自已備了。」趙管賬的身子在末一個字音那裏又倒在床上了。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（三十九）（續昨）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（十）（六）「香草美人」導演陳鏗然（下）</p>
<p>「在『展覧會』之後，現在所導演的是什麽片子？」</p>
<p>「現在已經開拍的是『女性的仇敵』（題目暫定），爲徐琴芳，高倩蘋，孫敏三人主演。這中間是寫女人的痛苦，同時也寫到做官人的罪惡。大槪三四月間，可以完結。」</p>
<p>「現在我所要問的，」我說：「便是先生對於外國電影有什麽意見？」</p>
<p>「這個，……」他想了很久，沉默着，其後他說：</p>
<p>「我想，關於這一點，還是讓我有一個機會書面的寫出來罷。現在一時覺得無從說起。」</p>
<p>「也好。」我再說：「那末請你發表一些對於中國電影的意見罷。」</p>
<p>他又想了一會兒，然後很愼重說：</p>
<p>「中國影片，能使人很滿足的，的確太少，可是目前所走的路綫却很正確，很明顯的，一般的觀衆，不需要神怪片或古裝戲，假使我們逼於不得已而走回那條路上去，那末便是中國電影的没落。自然，我並非說古裝絶對不可拍，只要演出的技巧好，仍然有一種歷史的意味。但是我個人，從來不拍古裝戲的，今後也决不拍那一類的影片，和我從前拍武俠片一様，前面說過純粹是因着資本，由於營業立塲出發的；現在觀衆已經在要求着切合着他們生活感情的影片，我們爲什麽還要往回跑呢？」</p>
<p>「至於我們導演者，受着雙重的壓迫，租界更不必說。不准說話，不准自由表現，這是大家知道的。所以在作品上所表現的一些，我們總覺得十分可憐。不過，雖然如此，我還希望影評人給我嚴格的指正。」</p>
<p>「此外，你個人以爲目前所需要的是一些什麽影片？」</p>
<p>「我以爲兒童教育，最爲重要。中國國民的教育程度太低，所以應當注重於農村教育。」</p>
<p>「…………………………」</p>
<p>「那末你除電影之外還有副業嗎？日常生活怎様？」</p>
<p>「無副業，經常看書看電影。」</p>
<p>「你自已不寫劇本嗎？」</p>
<p>「以前寫過，現在不寫了。」</p>
<p>此後再隨便談談。我便興辭而出。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「似水流年」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨丨北京映丨丨</p>
<p>首先我應當肯定的說，這是天一公司在技術上最完善的作品。</p>
<p>雖然我從來没有讀過張恨水的小說，「似水流年」原著如何，我一點也不知道，不過在電影上，對於學生生活的素描，有些地方，却是寫得非常逼眞而生動的。例如黄惜時買了幾件糖果，很小心裝在盆子裏，將茶壺用園巾包起來，房裏的垃圾掃起來藏在床下；這些，都是學生們特有的性格，特别是爲了等候情人之來臨，那純善的討好情人之歡心的體貼入微之處，到底在電影上都是描寫得十分細腻的。此外，還有課堂中的寫紙條，邱九思之輩的猜拳，唱京戲，這些都給導演當作噱頭使用，然而正因爲如此，便覺得生動而眞實。</p>
<p>我不管原著是否如此精采，但是導演高黎痕在這些地方確有甚可寶貴的成就。關於他，我們從前曾經看過他的「壓迫」（明星出品）。在「壓迫」中，我們看不到導演手法的特殊成績，而相反的在這「似水流年」中却顯出了他特殊的成功</p>
<p>除了上述的諸塲面之外，我們更不妨就整個的方面來說，至少我們不能找出他Ｍontage的方法如何不合理的地方。這裏包含了畫面的構成和盡面的編輯。由於他自身對於學生生活之理解，由於他對於小布爾喬亞生活之經騐，由於他也同様是封建殘餘中逃向這過渡時代的人物，於是他以自身之體念而創作了這相當接近於實生活寫照的「以水流年」。最值得注意的，還是他對於情調的把握。這在電影創作上應當是最艱難的課題。但是「似水流年」中，那悒鬱而傷感的冰冷的調子，確是非常動人的。以我自已的經騐來說，這種氣氛的把握，不論在任何部門的藝術作品中，都是不易於成就的。在電影上那柏蒲斯脫的「伏虎美人」，無疑的在這一方面最爲成功，「似水流年」與之相比，自然相差甚遠，然而已經足以動人的了，特别是對於我們這小布爾喬亞之羣。</p>
<p>現在我們不妨再舉出幾點小的地方。好的方面有：</p>
<p>（一）烟，茶，酒等，對比的Ｄissolve</p>
<p>（二）開始時那蘆花的畫面很美。在這裏使我們想起白樂天的「楓葉荻花秋瑟瑟」的詩句，假使這美妙的詩意能够在畫面上完全表現出來，那是多麽够味啊。導演者雖然没有如此描寫的魄力，然而仍是相當的美妙。</p>
<p>另外不够的方面有：</p>
<p>（一）北京前門外的人物是呆的，這自然是没有到北京去拍的原故。可是導演假使善於取巧的話，可以不用照片而用模型，假使不要下非的人物，不是很容易掩蓋麽？</p>
<p>（二）有許多總說明的字幕可以省掉，如「次日黎明卽起，洒掃房間，恭候白行素駕臨」這和「一個女明星」中的，「寂寞凄凉夜」「燈紅酒綠時」等同様是多餘的。</p>
<p>（三）肉感的塲面，應該受着嚴格的指斥。</p>
<p>以上寫的一些，都是關於技術的檢討。至於關於内容的評價，那末鴛鴦蝴蝶派始終是鴛鴦蝴蝶派。當然我並不說這様的對青年說教，以及教那封建的老頭兒出資創辦義務小學；如何要不得，然而始終不過是鴛鴦蝴蝶派中比較進步的東西，至於在我們看來仍然是落後時代的了。</p>
<h3>評「情郎心香」Ｇirl　Ｗithout　a　Ｒoom</h3>
<p>— 亞夫</p>
<p>丨大光明丨</p>
<p>現在外片的譯名，眞是無奇不有了。這不僅是和原名相着甚遠，卽在這「情郎心香」四個漢字上談，也太俚俗不堪了。</p>
<p>關於這一影片，很明顯的是寫實主義者對於未來派之譏諷爲主題的。湯姆是一個舊寫實主義的畫家，自美國到巴黎之後，便爲新派的藝術家所包圍，其中有被革命勢力所打擊的俄國皇室的流浪人，有放浪的音樂家，畫家；結果，湯姆被這一羣藝人的生活思想所薰染，也同流合汚的成爲未來派的畫家。可是他的作品並不爲：所謂新派的畫家所理解，一些評判員將他的畫掛倒了。從此。湯姆對於這一羣所謂藝人，十分鄙視，然而爲吃飯，爲了畫可賣錢，他終於放棄了自已的主見而混入這一人羣中去。</p>
<p>站在作者的觀念上來說，他是非常惋惜寫實主義之命運的。據他的解釋，新派的藝術，由於表現派，構成派，以至這未來派，已經成爲一種流派，差不多形成了一種潮流，而寫實主義的青年們，便爲了趨於潮流而成爲不可理喻的盲從者。這似乎是十分可恥的現象。但是藝術家始終是要吃飯的，在旣不能轉換這一潮流就得爲這一潮流所同化，這是很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>我們知道，未來主義的產生，自一九零九年最初的宣言上看來，它是將藝術從頽廢派的消極性推向全能的力，從象徵主義到現實性，從過去到未來，就是這様傲謾的放棄過去的藝術追尋未來的藝術。他們所描寫的是汽車的疾馳，工塲中機器的騷音，飛機的轟聲，鐵橋梁的光輝，軍艦的黑烟等，一切力學的物質，都成爲他們藝術的對象。從這方面看來，這未來派的產生，完全是資本主義的歌頌者，讚美者。在其積極性方面來說，自然它是揚棄一切腐敗糜爛的東西，而將現社會中一切最進步的最特徵的加以讚揚。但是在目前資本主義的一切都在日益崩潰之中，他們必然的前途將是什麽呢？他們將無所表現，也許在繪畫上最後的表現，便只有黑色的方塊。</p>
<p>在蘇聯革命後五年計劃的初期，也同様有禮讚工業的未來派的繪畫產生。因此我們知道未來派的確是時代反映最尖端的藝術。正因爲如此，他們前進的可以成爲新文明的和平的傳道者，也可以成爲新社會建設的革命家，同様亦可以成爲在舊社會掙扎着的迴光反照的法西斯蒂。</p>
<p>當然，在這一影片中，作者却完全是站在舊的觀念上解釋和分析，他只是固執着舊的自然主義的存在，而將流行着的未來主義加以譏諷。然而他並不能消滅這一流派之存在，而相反的惋惜寫實主義的滅亡。</p>
<p>不錯，作者是在無可如何的境地中，旣不能正面的打擊，只能作輕鬆的譏諷。於是他不僅是有畫的對比，而在他們的個性或生活中亦是盡情的笑駡。亡命徒之無理，他們生活的爢爛或漫漫，更有力的寫到那一羣盲目無知的鑒賞者和批評家。</p>
<p>他用着非常明快活潑的調子，自然這對於諷剌劇非常適宜。然而這决不是滑稽劇的無理取鬧或打譂。我們不必在開頭時特寫一個假月亮而發現他的聰明，更舉一例；如特寫一幅風景圖畫，我們一定以爲外景，少停，在角上簽上Ｔom的名字，再將鏡頭退後，於是我們知道那是一幅寫實主義的油畫，而這畫家的名字便是湯姆，立刻將主人公整個的介紹出來。</p>
<p>於此可見一班，導演Ｐalph　Ｍurphy　的手法確是非常可取的。然而這也决不是偉大的作品，我們只覺得這一隻活潑而小巧的動物。</p>
<p>演員們都還可取，但却爾福雷却不像默片時代那般深刻動人了。</p>

<h3>電影小說克利斯相娜ＱueenＣhristina（十）</h3>
<p>— 笏臣</p>
<p>愛葩似乎没有什麽可說的，祇告訴她說西班牙的欽差已經到了，克利斯丁娜聽見了西班牙欽差的名字，一顆芳心勃勃地跳了起來。她竭力掩蓋着自已的情感，假意地問道：「那人是什麽模様的？」愛葩說：「那西班牙欽差年紀很輕，很美貌，用錢亦很揮霍，朝廷裏的貴婦們都很傾心於他。」克利斯丁娜道：「那麽快？」她說完了，一個承啓官進來說度支大臣叩見陛下。克利斯丁娜聽了，覺得局勢更加緊張起來，她知道那位度支大臣麥格納斯不是好惹的。他是朝廷上一位最機巧狡滑的大臣。雖然她自已一個人對他並没有什麽畏懼，可是現在已經不是她一個人的事情，而是關係到另外一個人的平安和安全的，所以她一定要十分小心纔好。她想了一想，就吩咐那承啟官說一回兒就見他。那承啓官退出去了。</p>
<p>克利斯丁娜走進廣廳的時候，度支大臣麥格納斯立卽回過身來。他看着女王穿着國家的宫妝，愈顯得儀態萬方，就露出十二分的愛慕。他彎着腰吻着女王的乎背，可是女王的手突然地縮了回去。她說她不能多躭擱，還要和羣臣朝見哩。麥格納斯道：「陛下在外已經躭擱了五天。到底陛下到什麽地方去了？弄得滿朝的大臣，都莫名其妙，陛下到薩拉去了嗎？」克利斯丁娜道：「或者去的。」麥格納斯道：「但是你事實上没有去，因爲我們派人去尋過的。」克利斯丁娜道：「那末我幸虧没有去。」麥格納斯的眼睛，緊緊釘着女王問道：「那末到底陛下爲什麽要走呢？」克利斯丁娜道：「要走開幾天。」麥格納斯道：「要離開我嗎？」克利斯丁娜道：「要和你們都離開些。你們逼着我，要我答應。我所以就走開些，去靜想靜想。」麥格納斯道：「那末現在已經想停當了嗎？」克利斯丁娜道：「現在想停當了。」</p>

They sent a telegram to Sun in their private names, as a final piece of advice. The telegram was drafted yesterday and submitted to He for approval and was sent this morning. The content is divided into three points, advising Sun to immediately obey the order of the Military Affairs Commission to leave the army, and the troops are to be commanded by Yu Shiming, Ding Futing, and Liu Yueting to implement thorough downsizing. After Sun leaves the army, his personal safety will be guaranteed, and he will be free to live wherever he wants.

In the future, He Yingqin intends to take on part of Sun's living expenses. Jin Zunhua visited Fu Zuoyi last night, and they talked for about an hour. Jin telegraphed Sun today, in addition to conveying all the Beiping decisions, and advised Sun to withdraw immediately, so as not to betray the great love and desire for peace of all friends in Beiping. Whether Sun is sincere depends on whether he replies to the telegram. Wang Jingguo's entire force has arrived at Linhe.

<h3>President Wang Reports on Production and Construction at the Executive Yuan's Weekly Memorial Service</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held a weekly memorial service on the morning of the 19th, attended by all staff members. President Wang Zhaoming reported on production and construction as the direction of future efforts, roughly stating: On the 11th, he and Chairman Chiang issued a joint telegram, reiterating the main points of saving the country and surviving, emphasizing that the most urgent thing for treating the symptoms is to eliminate the communist bandits, and the most urgent thing for treating the root cause is production and construction. In the National Government's Memorial Week, he stated his purpose: In the past year of bandit suppression, Chairman Chiang personally supervised the war in Nanchang, and the proper dispatch and the use of the soldiers' lives have made considerable progress. In addition to the strategic superiority and tactical agility, the construction of blockhouses and the opening of highways are also important reasons for its victory. Following this trend, perseverance, dare to believe that the elimination of communist bandits, will be sure to have a grasp. As for production and construction, not only need talents, but also need material resources. In view of China's backward economic situation, there are many domestic production projects that should be constructed, but few can be implemented, which inevitably makes people discouraged, and even doubt that the so-called production and construction is just empty talk. At present, all agencies in the country only have maintenance fees, and no construction fees. During the period of bandit suppression, even the construction fees of the army have not been settled, so it is too early to be optimistic about the future of production and construction. However, enriching the people's strength and developing the national strength are the only way for production and construction. We must plan and proceed in the midst of great difficulties. Even if there is no large-scale, at least we must start from small things. If we cannot implement new plans, at least we must rectify the old ones. If we cannot seek development from the active aspect, at least we must eliminate the accumulated ills from the passive aspect. We hope to accumulate small amounts into many through continuous efforts. We dare not say how many construction projects have been successful in the past two years, but we have always held this determination to be responsible for production and construction and to do our work. Now, let's take the railway and transportation as examples to illustrate that production and construction is a real effort, a fact that has been worked hard in the past, and a direction that needs to be worked hard in the future. It is by no means just a propaganda slogan. First, let's talk about the railway. The railway is the lifeline of national transportation. Therefore, in the past two years, the government has focused on this work, one is to rectify the old roads, and the other is to build new roads. The most important ones that have been built one after another include: First, the Yuehan Line, which has never been connected from Liangguang to the Yangtze River since the 23rd year of the Republic of China, will start construction today and is expected to be completed within three years. Second, the Longhai Line, which connects Shaanxi and Gansu, is expected to reach Xi'an around the Double Ten Festival this year. Third, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan Line, which connects the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, is completely newly built. If the Yuehan Line is completed, there will be a direct trunk line in the central north and south; if the Longhai Line is completed, the northwest will have the possibility of development; if the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan Line is completed, the close connection of the economy and culture of the southeastern provinces will be more convenient. In addition, there are many others such as the construction of Laoyao Wharf on the Longhai Line, the repair of the Shanghai North Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, the completion of the Capital Ferry Project, the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangxi Railway in Zhejiang Province, and others operated by private enterprises. It should be noted here that the construction of railways requires huge sums of money. In economically backward countries, these huge sums of money can only be raised from countries with abundant capital. Since we want to attract foreign investment, we must clearly indicate its guarantee for future investment. Therefore, the government attaches great importance to railway credit. Under certain conditions, the government is very willing to cooperate with foreign capital and is willing to do its best to maintain credit and protect the interests of investors. The government is determined to reorganize the previous railway debts owed to foreigners in a way that maintains the interests of both parties. In the past two years, considerable reorganization and repayment methods have been established for various railway debts, both Chinese and foreign. The debts of the national railways are roughly divided into (1) contract loans, (2) material loans, and (3) short-term loans. Regarding the first type, considerable repayment methods have been established for the accumulated debts of the Jinpu, Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Daoqing, and Bianluo railways, and they are being implemented one after another. The debts of the Beining Railway are all performed in accordance with the contract. Regarding the second type, the material debts of the railways in the past two years, which have been reorganized and have repayment methods, include debts to merchants in the United Kingdom and the United States, totaling 100 million yuan. The third type of short-term loans is mostly owed to domestic banks, and considerable repayment methods have also been established and are being implemented one after another. Foreign creditors often complain about China's railways for failing to repay the debts and interest on time. The government naturally expresses its apology for the debts owed, but there are two points that it hopes creditors will pay attention to. One, railway creditors must know that due to the impact of the temporary situation, the debts have been delayed, which is a common occurrence in all countries. There are many reasons for the poor financial situation of Chinese railways, and it cannot all be blamed on one thing or one person. For example, before the construction of several railways was completed, the European War broke out suddenly, and the funds could not be continued to be raised in accordance with the contract, so the project was interrupted. However, the capital that has already been invested should still be planned year by year. The financial situation of the railway fell into extreme difficulties. The reason for this is the outbreak of the European War. Neither creditors nor the Chinese government can be blamed. Another example is the drop in the world's silver price and the recent global economic downturn, which has led to an increase in China's railway debt on the one hand and a decrease in revenue on the other, which is no different from a natural disaster. No country can stop it, and China cannot be blamed alone. Second, railway creditors must know that the Chinese government is not defaulting on its debts, but the premise for clearing debts is the reorganization and revitalization of the railway. If the railway is reorganized and revitalized, and the revenue increases, the interests of the creditors can be guaranteed. Therefore, to reorganize the railway and repay the debts, it is necessary for the creditors and the Chinese government to cooperate sincerely. Next, let's talk about transportation. The most important transportation industries are post, telecommunications, and aviation. In recent years, civil aviation has also become one of the transportation industries. As far as postal services are concerned, China has been running modern postal services for more than 60 years. Its scale and system are very developed and it has annual surpluses. However, in recent years, due to floods and banditry, and the Northeast Incident, the postal economy has suffered a huge loss of 10 million yuan. The internal business has also gradually deteriorated. In recent years, the government has devoted itself to the reorganization of the postal service itself and the development of the savings and remittance business. With the current economic situation, to reorganize the postal service itself, we can only adopt a policy of austerity, save expenses, and expand business. According to the report of the Ministry of Communications, as of the end of June last year, there were more than 12,000 post offices and more than 32,000 postal counters and agencies nationwide, with a postal route of 490,000 kilometers. This year, we will actively carry out additional installations, and it is expected that at least 5% of the postal route will be extended in another half year, and it will be extended to the border areas. As for the development of savings and remittance, we will focus on protecting the interests of depositors. Therefore, the government has decided to change the savings and remittances to the postal service, but still maintain its professional advantages, accounting independence, and not mixing it with the postal accounts. At the same time, a supervision system will be set up so that the people can openly supervise it. The investment restrictions are very strict. Although all the regulations have yet to be passed by the Legislative Yuan, they have gradually been implemented in fact. As far as telecommunications is concerned, the reorganization and development of telecommunications in the past year is divided into international telecommunications and domestic telecommunications. In the past, international telecommunications relied entirely on the submarine cables operated by foreign companies for communication. Since the completion of the Zhenru International Radio Station, China has successively communicated directly with the United States, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Manila, Java, Saigon, and Hong Kong via radio. On the one hand, it revised the contract with the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies for operating submarine cables in China to recover the right to send and receive telegrams; on the other hand, it added Sino-American circuits and opened Sino-Russian circuits. For direct communication with the United Kingdom, another Central Radio Station was specially added outside the Zhenru International Radio Station for special use due to the prosperity of commerce between the two countries. In addition, an international interchange station with the same scale as the Zhenru Radio Station was set up in Luoyang, and it is currently under construction and will be completed soon. As for domestic communication, in terms of wired communication, because of frequent years of war, banditry, and wind disasters, there has been a lot of damage. In the past year, a total of more than 5,000 miles of poles and lines have been repaired. The most important of these is the Hanyu Line, which is 2,500 miles long and is an important way for communication between central China and Sichuan and Tibet. It will be completed soon. In addition, the old-fashioned telegraph machines in various places will be replaced with new machines. More than 50 places have been completed in the past year. In terms of wireless communication, wireless communication was set up in important cities in the past. In the past year, the focus has been on the connection with the border areas. The plan to establish border radio stations has been determined. The two stations that have been established for communication this year are Xi'an and Zhangjia, one is to develop telecommunications and transportation in the northwest, and the other is to maintain contact between Mongolia and the central government. As for Xinjiang and Ximeng, it was originally planned to set up eight stations each, and everything has been prepared. Unfortunately, the local situation is unstable and it has been temporarily suspended. Other places such as Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Sichuan and Kang have either been installed or are under planning and can be realized within a year. In terms of telephone, in the past year, the focus has been on the connection between long-distance telephones and urban telephones. The development plans that have been prepared are the three major trunk lines of Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Tianjin, and Beijing-Hangzhou. The lines that are about to be built are the Beijing-Shanghai along the highway. The lines that have been completed are the Nanfu Line and the Ping-Chahar Line, and the telephone has been opened in six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Hebei, using telegraph poles and lines, which has reached more than 300 places. Recently, it is planned to set up a telephone network in the whole province of Jiangsu, and the first phase has started. As for the telephone in Beijing, the ones that have been improved and expanded in the past year include seven cities: Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, and Zhenjiang. Shanghai has the best results. In addition, wireless telephones are used to improve transportation. Domestic communication will be held in Beijing, Hankou, Fuzhou, and other places first. As for international telephones, the equipment has also been installed, and it will be opened as soon as the trial is successful. In terms of maritime administration, it is a great shame for China. Whether it is inland rivers or outer seas, they are all contracted by foreigners. Our only foundation is the two shipyards of Jiangnan and Mawei, and a China Merchants Bureau. The two shipyards of Jiangnan and Mawei are not large in scale, and the China Merchants Bureau has gone bankrupt due to poor management. Other private shipping industries are even more immature. Maritime administration construction requires huge expenses, and each ship costs hundreds of millions of gold. The government can only take the China Merchants Bureau back into state-owned management first and engage in rectification. In the past year, in addition to recovering almost all of the bureau's stocks, a debt clearing committee has been established, and the business has been actively reformed. The operating income in the first half of the year alone has reached 3.66 million yuan. As for civil aviation, it is operated by China and Eurasia Airlines. Before the development of China Airlines, the routes only included Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Beiping. In the past year, the Shanghai-Hankou route has been actively developed and has been expanded to Chengdu. The Shanghai-Beiping line, which was previously suspended, has been changed to a coastal route. In addition, a coastal Shanghai-Guangdong line has been added, and the business is very developed. Recently, we have started to expand the route from Chengdu and connect Guiyang, Kunming, and other places, and have conducted a trial flight once. The Eurasia route of Eurasia Airlines is from Shanghai to Tacheng, and is connected to the Soviet Russian route in Tacheng, via Moscow to Berlin. Shanghai to Dihua was opened for several months, but it was interrupted again due to the unrest in the political situation in Xinjiang. Now it only goes to Lanzhou, and we are still continuing to find ways to restore it. In addition, Eurasia Airlines has added branch lines, one from Lanzhou to Xining and Ningxia, one from Dihua to Yili, and one from Dihua to Tashkent. The section from Xi'an to Beiping has been opened. Recently, a line from Guangzhou via Hankou to Xi'an has been added. The Guangdong-Hankou section has been successfully tested, and it can be opened as soon as the Guangzhou airport is completed. The above only mentions the four major industries of post, telecommunications, aviation, and civil aviation. The government has paid great attention to the reorganization of the agencies of these industries in the past year, with the aim of merging the telecommunications agencies and integrating the unevenly organized agencies of telegraph, telecommunications, wired telecommunications, and wireless telecommunications into a systematic organization. Secondly, accounting is reorganized, and active measures are taken to apply the new accounting system to the four industries. In addition to formulating various accounting systems, Chinese and foreign accountants are hired to audit each agency to make their accounts public. Those that have been implemented include Eurasia and China Airlines, and other agencies will also start to be held separately. Thirdly, personnel and business are reorganized. In the postal service, the personnel system is made more reasonable; in the telecommunications service, redundant personnel are laid off and work efficiency is reduced. In addition, the electricity fee is reduced to facilitate the people and promote business. In short, the government has reorganized the four industries of post, telecommunications, and aviation in the past year. There are many difficulties, and we can only continue to work hard to accomplish our work without slackening. The above briefly mentions the construction work in the two aspects of railway and transportation. From this, it can be seen that the so-called production and construction is not a propaganda, but a real effort to do. In the future, we can only gather the national strength and move forward. As for the diplomatic aspect, some people have criticized the government for being weak and incompetent. The government does not answer at all, because these criticisms, if they are out of enthusiastic criticism, the government cannot bear to answer, if they are out of malicious slander, the government does not bother to answer. To correct this weakness and incompetence, we can only enrich the people's strength and develop the national strength. The only way is to work hard on production and construction. As far as resisting strong neighbors is concerned, this is the only way. All the illusory psychology and fluke expectations that China used to have should be completely swept away. As far as maintaining international sympathy is concerned, this is also the only way. Someone asked me, what kind of diplomatic policy should China adopt today? I resolutely replied, improving internal affairs is the diplomatic policy that China should adopt today, because only by improving internal affairs can we make people look up to us and make people willing to be friends with us. Other than that, coalition and alliance are self-defeating. Therefore, we believe that diplomacy is only one aspect of internal affairs. Only by striving for achievement in internal affairs can we get rid of the predicament of weakness and incompetence in diplomacy. The reason why we issued a sincere telegram this month after last year's frugal telegram is nothing more than this. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>A Perspective on the Inside Story of the Austrian Crisis</h3>
<p>The recent riot of the Austrian Social Democratic Party arrived suddenly like a violent storm, catching people off guard. However, it suffered a crushing defeat within days. It seemed that Dollfuss' iron fist was able to control this precarious situation. Unexpectedly, as the Austrian government was celebrating its victory, news came that Dollfuss was seeking help from the League of Nations. This was followed by France, Italy, and Britain expressing their support for Austrian independence, as if the future disaster would be far worse than the current riot. This is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>However, upon examining the inside story, it becomes clear that Dollfuss's fears are not about the resurgence of the Social Democratic Party, but about the German National Socialist Party taking advantage of the chaos. What frightens France and Italy is not the Social Democratic Party's comeback, but the promotion of the German-Austrian merger, which would break the balance of power in the Danube region and restore Germany as the hegemon of Central Europe. According to the Treaty of Versailles, after the establishment of the peace treaty, Germany lost 27,000 square English miles of land in Europe and more than 6 million people, which were incorporated into France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and other countries. If the plan for the German-Austrian merger could be realized, Germany could suddenly increase its land by 32,000 English miles and its population by 6.5 million, instantly making up for its post-war losses in Europe. Wouldn't this be a joyous event? Germany and Austria share the same language and culture, and it is perfectly natural to merge and govern based on the principle of national self-determination. This cannot be equated with aggression and annexation. This is what those who understand the history of the German and Austrian nations have long known. The Treaty of Saint-Germain specifically stipulates the independence of Austria, also because the German and Austrian nations are the same, making it easy to merge. Therefore, this provision was specifically set up as a hidden danger, as a basis for future implementation of the ban. However, since the Great War, Germany and Austria have indeed had the desire to merge. For example, the Austrian draft constitution of December 12, 1918, declared, "German Austria is a part of the German Republic. Special laws will be enacted separately regarding the participation of German Austria in the legislative and administrative affairs of the German Republic and the implementation of German laws in Austria." The following year, the official Austrian constitution also contained similar statements. As for the German constitution, although there is no explicit expression, Article 2 states, "For the purpose of exercising the right of national self-determination, Germany may accept the merger of other countries." The intention is self-evident. In the spring of 1921, the majority of the Austrian people advocated resolving the issue of German-Austrian merger through voting, but unfortunately, they were suppressed by external forces and failed. After that, the German-Austrian merger almost became an illusion. It was not until after 1928 that another path was sought, from an economic alliance to a political union. Unexpectedly, France saw through the hidden motive and pointed out that it violated the treaty. Finally, in 1931, the dream of this economic alliance was shattered by the decision of the International Court of Justice. Since then, the German-Austrian merger has fallen into a stalemate again. It was not until after the rise of Hitler, the leader of the German National Socialist Party, that there was a turning point. Hitler himself was of Austrian origin, and his desire for merger was even stronger than others. The means he adopted were also very clever, that is, organizing the same National Socialist Party in Austria, seizing its political power, and manipulating its cabinet, so that Austria's domestic and foreign policies would be entirely at the mercy of Germany. In this way, it would not conflict with the provisions of the treaty, and it could achieve the actual effect of the merger. Therefore, Hitler believed that this was the best plan.</p>
<p>However, Hitler's method, clever as it is, has encountered more difficulties than before. In the past, the opposition to the German-Austrian merger came mostly from external forces, but now even Austria holds different views. The reason is that Hitler's administration is reckless and radical, favoring his own party and excluding dissidents. Once he came to power, he had no one but himself, which frightened the Austrian political parties. In the past, they sought merger but could not obtain it, but now they regard merger as a suicidal path. In the past two years, Dollfuss has spared no effort to restrict the activities of the Nazi Party in Austria, all driven by this terror. Eliminating dissidents is originally what the Nazi Party excels at, but now Dollfuss is using the other person's methods to treat the other person, and as a result, he has also unconsciously become fascist. In short, in this incident, the Austrian Social Democratic Party was the first to bear the brunt, but in terms of its international seriousness, the Nazi Party's activities are the root cause. Otherwise, Dollfuss and countries such as France and Italy would not need to be so alarmed. If you don't believe me, look at the division of Austrian political parties today. The ruling party is the Christian Social Party, whose backbone is conservative Catholics who have never advocated the German-Austrian merger. The Social Democratic Party, on the other hand, mostly leans towards merger. Therefore, it is only reasonable to say that the Social Democratic Party's activities are secretly assisted by the Nazi Party.</p>
<p>I still remember that before Hitler came to power, his slogans and catchphrases were so beautiful that it seemed as if Germany would have a way out once he took office. Unexpectedly, it has been nearly two years since he came to power, and many of the promises he made to the German people have not been fulfilled. Now, the international situation is even more unfavorable to him. Even Austria, which shares the same language and culture, has turned against him and would rather seek protection from foreign countries. For Hitler, I really don't know what other tricks he has to clean up the mess.</p>
<h3>The Diet is Tense over the Review of the Bribery Case of the Minister of Education</h3>
<p>Agreement on a Reward of Two Million Yen</p>
<p>Newspapers Wrapped Five Hundred Thousand Yen in Hundred-Yen Notes</p>
<p>Okamoto Claims to Have Obtained Various Evidence</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The inquiry committee, which the entire nation of Japan is watching, convened at 10:40 this morning. Today's meeting summoned Okamoto and Eto to deliberate on the 50,000 yen bribery case involving Education Minister Hatoyama and the Sakhalin Industries Company, as well as the disciplinary problems related to the Japanese Artificial Silk Company and Kobe Steel Company, which involved 120 Diet members from the Seiyukai party. The atmosphere in the Diet was extremely tense. Committee Chairman Shimada first reported that the committee had requested the attendance of various ministers and secretaries Lin and Yoneda, according to the decision of the previous meeting.</p>
<p>The inquiry began immediately. Hamada Kunimatsu asked,</p>
<p>I have heard that Mr. Okamoto has evidence to prove the truth of this case. Is this true?</p>
<p>Okamoto replied,</p>
<p>Of course, I have a factual basis before I dare to speak. I can reveal the names of the people involved in this case, but there will be those who will suffer as a result. Who should bear the responsibility for this must be decided first.</p>
<p>Okamoto and Hamada answered each other several times. Okamoto wanted to explain the truth about Education Minister Hatoyama's trip to Kansai to resolve the Kyoto Imperial University Prof. Kawakami incident, during which he secretly engaged in activities related to the Japanese Artificial Silk and Kobe Steel Company problems. Committee Chairman Shimada warned Okamoto,</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto, what you want to say is not related to Mr. Hamada's questions. Please answer the questions.</p>
<p>At this time, Kiyose Ichiro of the Nationalist Alliance heckled Shimada from his seat,</p>
<p>Does the committee chairman want to collude with Mr. Hamada to prevent Okamoto from speaking?</p>
<p>A dispute arose between the two, and the Diet was temporarily disturbed.</p>
<p>Agreement on Two Million Yen Reward</p>
<p>Then, Okamoto continued,</p>
<p>This issue cannot be explained in a single sentence. When Education Minister Hatoyama stayed in Kansai, his secretary, Mr. Lin, met with Nomura Tokushichi, a giant in the financial world, to mediate the disposal of shares. An agreement on a reward of two million yen was reached between the two. Mr. Yoneda is also involved in this matter. I have brought the documentary evidence. If necessary, I can present it to the public.</p>
<p>Hamada asked,</p>
<p>Does Mr. Okamoto have any evidence regarding his statement on the 13th about the Sakhalin Industries Company?</p>
<p>Okamoto replied,</p>
<p>Before discussing the evidence issue, it is necessary to explain whose words have more probative value, Education Minister Hatoyama's or mine. Education Minister Hatoyama denies the fact that I met with the Hatoyama couple, which is unfounded.</p>
<p>Newspapers Wrapped Five Hundred Thousand Yen in Hundred-Yen Notes</p>
<p>Okamoto then mentioned the main points of the Sakhalin Industries issue, saying,</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Hatoyama said to me, "Fujita Yoshisaburo is waiting. You can go and see him immediately." I went to see Fujita, and Fujita immediately said, "Are you handling this matter?" I asked, "What matter?" Then Fujita was very flustered. When I returned to Mr. Hatoyama's place, Hatoyama said to me, "We have agreed that you have received the money. So, when the court asks about this matter, please answer that you have indeed received 50,000 yen in hundred-yen notes wrapped in newspaper." I immediately said to Hatoyama, "If this case is related to the rise and fall of your family, then I can handle this matter for you on your behalf." Later, I was questioned by the judicial authorities for the crime of destroying evidence because of this issue, but the prosecution was suspended.</p>
<p>Hamada asked,</p>
<p>The point of suspended prosecution is very important. Is this a fact?</p>
<p>Okamoto replied,</p>
<p>I heard it said that way. I have not yet investigated whether it is true or false.</p>
<p>The meeting temporarily adjourned at 11:55.</p>
<p>The inquiry into Okamoto Ichi's case continued at 1:40 p.m. today in a tense atmosphere. Regarding the relationship between the Kobe Steel stock and the Taiwan Bank stock issues and the two ministers Hatoyama and Mitsuchi, Mr. Hamada asked,</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of Taiwan Bank stock, even if there were improprieties in terms of timing and value, the existence of a relationship between Yoneda and Lin is still a separate issue. Who manufactured the diagram that Mr. Okamoto claims to have obtained (which records the system of handing over money)?</p>
<p>Okamoto replied,</p>
<p>Mr. Kuba Yoshimichi, a member of the Seiyukai party.</p>
<h3>Many of Those Implicated Choose to Remain Silent</h3>
<p>Okamoto then handed the diagram to Committee Chairman Shimada. The committee chairman then handed it to the other members for them to pass around and view. Committee Chairman Shimada then stated,</p>
<p>This diagram will be copied and returned later.</p>
<p>Okamoto immediately said,</p>
<p>I don't want to cause useless harm. If I explain the inside story, then many people will be implicated. Therefore, it is better to remain silent.</p>
<p>Regarding Morita Masayoshi, the administrator of Hatoyama's farm in northern Korea, he transported many hundred-yen notes last year and was ordered by his master to distribute them. It is said that the number of people was over one hundred.</p>
<p>When Ueda wanted to pursue the matter further, Okamoto said, There is no need to answer this matter any further.</p>
<p>Next, Kiyose Ichiro asked why the Minister of Justice had requested the documents related to the Fujita Kozaaburo incident three days ago and had not yet submitted them.</p>
<h3>What After the Collapse of the Saito Cabinet?</h3>
<p>The Takahashi-Yamamoto Coalition Cabinet Theory</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the deterioration of the disciplinary problems, the resignation of Education Minister Hatoyama has become unavoidable and is likely to develop into the resignation of the Saito Cabinet. According to observations in political circles, if the Saito Cabinet resigns due to the disciplinary problems, the Emperor's order to form a cabinet will definitely not be given to Saito again. Who will be the leader of the succeeding cabinet? It is predicted that Vice President of the Privy Council Hiranuma or Korean Governor-General Ugaki will step forward. There is also a theory of a coalition cabinet between Finance Minister Takahashi and Home Minister Yamamoto. This coalition cabinet has a major relationship with the establishment of the budget for the ninth fiscal year. After the fall of the Saito Cabinet, the only cabinet that has the possibility of temporarily cleaning up the political situation and ensuring the smooth establishment of the budget is this cabinet. Therefore, there is talk of such a coalition cabinet. (19th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Oyama replied,</p>
<p>There is absolutely no intention to refuse to submit the records of the public trial. Kiyose asked,</p>
<p>What is the meaning of "newspapers do not constitute a crime"?</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Oyama replied,</p>
<p>The records in the newspapers do not bear any responsibility.</p>
<h3>Why Doesn't the Court Summon Okamoto, Who Received 50,000 Yen in Bribes?</h3>
<p>Kiyose Hopes That the Minister of Justice Will Maintain a Strict Position</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Taketomi asked,</p>
<p>Why was Mr. Okamoto, who received 50,000 yen in bribes, not summoned to the prosecutor's office to conduct an investigation?</p>
<p>Minister of Justice Oyama replied,</p>
<p>At that time, there were many major incidents, and there was a backlog of cases. The so-called Fujita incident had not been reported to this office. The fact that he was not summoned can only be known after the submission of the investigation documents.</p>
<p>Next, Diet member Morita Masayoshi, a member of the inquiry committee, requested to speak,</p>
<p>I once managed Hatoyama's farm in Korea, but the world misunderstands this farm. You should know that this facility was intended to help the poor people of Korea. That was the purpose. There was no profit involved. I am not a rich man either. Mr. Hatoyama did not trust me. There is no such thing as Mr. Okamoto said about distributing huge sums of money.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Kuba Yoshimichi, who allegedly created the diagram, Mr. Morita also claimed,</p>
<p>The Sixth High School Association is a gathering of graduates of the Sixth High School, including Mr. Lin and Mr. Yoneda. Mr. Kuboi is also a member of the association. The so-called diagram may be a temporary notebook entry, which cannot be the situation described by Mr. Okamoto. It should be requested that it be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto also spoke about Mr. Morita's claims, but it was extremely unclear. Finally, he raised various questions to Minister of Justice Oyama. The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m. (19th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saito's Advance or Retreat is Difficult</h3>
<p>Divergence of Opinions Within the Cabinet on the Issue of Total Resignation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the disciplinary problems of Education Minister Hatoyama and others, the consensus of the top leaders of the government, including the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Home Affairs, is as follows: (1) Regardless of the truth or falsehood of the matter, given that the situation has reached this point, it is hoped that Education Minister Hatoyama will voluntarily express his intention to resign. The position of the succeeding Minister of Education will not be filled temporarily, and the Prime Minister will concurrently assume the position. (2) If Education Minister Hatoyama has the determination to explain himself regarding the impeachment by the inquiry committee and the House of Peers, the government will not advise him to resign because the matter is different from the case of former Minister of Commerce Nakajima. Instead, it will support the Minister of Education to deal with the Diet. (3) Regarding the establishment of the budget for the next year, no matter how the House of Peers and the House of Representatives criticize it, we will endure it. Although the submission of the additional budget for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been delayed due to the illness of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto, the preparations have been completed. If Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto's illness is prolonged and the political situation is strained, it will be submitted to the Cabinet Council in the absence of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto and urgently submitted to the Diet. The approval of the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry will be requested afterward. However, many young cabinet members advocate for a total resignation at once because the investigation by the inquiry committee, if expanded, will affect not only Education Minister Hatoyama and Minister of Railways Mitsuchi, but also Minister of Justice Oyama, who was recently appointed Prosecutor-General, and Finance Minister Takahashi, who is responsible for supervising the disposal of shares owned by Taiwan Bank. Therefore, the earlier the time of total resignation, the better. Furthermore, it is difficult to expect a smooth transition of power in the future. Prime Minister Saito has the possibility of forming a cabinet again. Therefore, the opinion advocating for a total resignation is currently opposed by another opinion within the cabinet.

<h3>If the Minister of Education Resigns, It Will Also Be Unfavorable for the Minister of Railways</h3>
<p>The Political Situation is Extremely Serious</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese political situation is extremely serious due to the internal strife of the Seiyukai party and the disciplinary problems of Education Minister Hatoyama. The opinions of various parties in the political world on this situation are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Whether Education Minister Hatoyama should take responsibility and resign will be considered when Hatoyama voluntarily decides to resign.</p>
<p>(2) After the Minister of Education resigns, it is expected that there will be no pursuit of the responsibility of the entire cabinet. However, it is quite obvious that the faction aiming to overthrow the cabinet will shift its attack target to Minister of Railways Mitsuchi. In that case, the cabinet will be busy considering the advancement and retreat of cabinet members, so it will be difficult to maintain the regime as before.</p>
<p>(3) However, the current cabinet has a major responsibility to strive to pass the budget bill through the Diet because of the "Manchukuo" issue and the extraordinary situation in 1935 and 1936. Furthermore, its important mission of stabilizing the people's hearts has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, arbitrarily abandoning the cabinet violates its own mission. If the resignation of the Minister of Education is realized, Prime Minister Saito will negotiate with Seiyukai President Suzuki and request him to recommend a successor. In the event that the Seiyukai cannot consider the successor issue due to the expansion of internal strife, the Prime Minister may temporarily serve concurrently as the Minister of Education to avoid a political upheaval and ensure the smooth establishment of the budget.</p>
<p>(4) However, since the attitudes of the inquiry committee and the House of Peers have not yet been determined, it is still difficult to predict. It is reported that the military's opinion still advocates the doctrine of putting national defense first, with the most urgent task being to pass the budget for the ninth fiscal year. If the budget cannot be established due to a political upheaval, the national defense work will be greatly affected. Therefore, regardless of whether the current cabinet falls or not, they hope that the budget will be established. (18th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Education Minister Hatoyama visited Seiyukai President Suzuki yesterday for a short time to discuss the issue of his own advancement and retreat and the future political situation. After a long secret conversation, he told reporters after returning home that his visit to President Suzuki was naturally to discuss his personal issues. If his resignation is necessary for the party, he is willing to resign. The content of the meeting with the President cannot be disclosed at the moment. However, the President's opinion is to exercise caution. If he resigns suddenly because of unfounded accusations in the Diet, there is no reason to do so. He will not resign until the truth of this matter is clarified. Prime Minister Saito also has a firm belief that he will absolutely not resign due to a conspiracy to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, the cabinet will not resign. (19th Den-tsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ugaki Talks About the Current Cabinet</h3>

<h3>The Number of Overseas Chinese in British Territories Has Increased Greatly</h3>
<p>The British Believe It Is Disadvantageous</p>
<p>(London) The Colonial Office issued a report today stating that the number of overseas Chinese in the Straits Settlements has increased greatly in recent years. In 1881, there were only 174,327 people, and in 1931, it increased to 665,181 people. During the same period, the number of Chinese in Malaya increased from 194,469 to 285,316. Whether the expansion of any foreign race, most of which cannot be assimilated and retain their own customs and languages, is in the real interests of the social and economic progress of the people is questionable.

<h3>A White Russian Who Swindled and Deceived People in Mongolia Arrives in Beijing and is Detained</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Aratodumi Zhigeng was originally a White Russian. Since the establishment of the Soviet government, he has been naturalized as a Chinese citizen. He lived in Xinjiang and wandered around the interior for a year. Previously, due to financial difficulties, he begged for assistance from Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. Chu gave him travel expenses and issued a passport from the Executive Yuan to avoid detention by military police along the way. However, A stole the passport and extorted supplies and forcibly requisitioned horses in various leagues and banners in Mongolia. The leagues and banners telegraphed the Executive Yuan to file a complaint. A was unaware of this and even brought a steed to Beijing. On the morning of the 19th, he brought the horse to the Executive Yuan to visit Chu and present it as a gift. After Chu met him, he immediately questioned him, showed him the telegrams from the leagues, and accused him of swindling and violating criminal law. He was detained and handed over to the police to be sent to the court for punishment. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Absorbs Cash from Europe</h3>
<p>Nearly 200 Million in Cash Shipped to the US</p>
<p>The Value of Currencies in Gold Standard Countries Plummets</p>
<p>(New York) The amount of cash that the United States has been absorbing from various foreign countries recently is very large. According to general observation, it may soon cause the value of currencies in all countries that are currently on the gold standard to plummet. Even Germany and France are in a state of panic. Recently, the three major ships, the Taushulen, the Furenda, and the President Harding, have transported cash worth 65 million from various European ports in England, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The Europa also loaded 100 million in cash last week. However, as the value of European currencies falls, the depreciation of the US dollar becomes unprofitable. However, it is reported that the US President will not change his policy as a result. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>American Purchase of Large Quantities of Silver in the London Market</h3>
<p>U.S. Policy Rapidly Developing</p>
<p>Londoners Still Observing</p>
<p>(London) Recently, the United States has been purchasing large quantities of silver in the London market, leading to a general belief that the U.S. government's silver policy is rapidly developing. However, Londoners are currently maintaining a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting a clear statement of the U.S.'s concrete policy. If the U.S. intends to adopt a silver policy similar to its gold policy, difficulties are bound to arise, as the world has a large silver reserve. According to the opinion of a leading broker in the precious metals industry, such action by the U.S. would be greatly detrimental to the Far East, resulting in a large concentration of silver in New York, thus reducing currency reserves and causing contraction. Furthermore, silver, being a commodity, is best left to rise with commodity prices, rather than artificially increasing its value. Silver mining stocks on the stock exchange have seen their market prices rise in anticipation of U.S. action. The foreign exchange market anticipates that the Bank of France's gold reserves will gradually flow into the U.S. as the dollar's value falls. France's current austerity plan may increase the difficulties of the German treasury, which may be forced to raise debt, thus defeating the purpose of austerity. (19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the observation of general politicians and economists, the U.S. national management of silver affairs is about to be realized. According to the government's plan, it intends to first collect domestic silver and then adopt a bimetallic standard for the national currency. It is said that the U.S. government only purchases large silver bars and does not buy silver coins. Currently, the general public in the U.S. has a lot of speculation on this issue, and even the Senate and House of Representatives consider it the most wonderful and interesting issue.

In the cloakroom, the clothes the King was wearing before the accident were still hanging on the wall. Entering the Royal bedroom, the King's remains were seen lying across the Royal bed, with bloodstains and bruises visible on his hands. In his hands, he held a small ivory cross, which was given to the King by the blacks of the Congo in 1928 when he visited Africa. In front of the bed was a table, on which was placed a large cross, two candlesticks, and a dish of holy water with a small branch of boxwood. The steel helmet, military cap, and gloves that the King wore in the trenches during the war were placed on the cupboard, and a military sword was placed on the bookshelf. The Royal Spirit is now guarded by Father Delannoy, the palace chaplain, and two nuns. Members of the diplomatic corps have come to pay their respects to the Spirit.

<h3>Official Investigation of the Cause of the Disaster</h3>
<p>Climbing the Summit, Loose Rocks Cause Him to Fall</p>
<p>Brussels According to the official report of the judicial investigation into the death of Belgian King Albert I, the King's attendants rushed to the location the King had told them to go to at 5 p.m. They did not see the King and searched everywhere without finding him. At 7 p.m., they called the local gendarmerie and the palace from a nearby coffee shop. Aide-de-Camp de Thieusies, Royal Physician Nolf, and Count Segluna, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene and searched separately. Because of the dense fog, the search was quite difficult. Later, they found traces of the King climbing the mountain. It was not until 2 a.m. that they discovered the King's remains. They immediately carried the remains into a car and transported them to Laeken Palace. Judicial officials arrived at the scene of the accident at 3:40 a.m. and conducted a joint investigation with various experts. By 8 a.m., they had determined that the King had climbed to the highest point of the mountain. They found the King's footprints there. At that time, the King was standing on a large rock. Unfortunately, the rock fell, and the King fell with it. His body touched the rocks and died instantly. The corpse continued to roll down the cliff until it stopped 50 meters below. The scarf, handbag, cap, belt, and military items he carried with him were scattered everywhere and have all been found. (18th, Havas)</p>

Before he hit the ground, his head struck a rock and broke open. His body fell on its side, with its feet upward. There was a pool of blood around the head, and a part of the brain was on the rock.

<h3>Extradition Case of Assassin of Ma Zhanshan in the British Concession of Tianjin</h3>
<p>Fugitive Hides in a Certain Country’s Concession</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The assassin who attempted to murder Ma Zhanshan was detained in the British Municipal Council, but he did not provide any real confession, not even revealing his name. The ringleader is surnamed Zhang, and there are many accomplices, all from Shandong province. Besides those arrested, the rest fled into a certain country's concession. The Public Security Bureau sent out numerous detectives to vigorously search for them. The arrested female assassin, surnamed Cao, is about thirty years old, with bound feet, dressed as a servant. When captured, three Mauser pistols and two hand grenades were found in her crotch. She struggled for a long time before being subdued. On the 18th night, due to the British Municipal Council's investigative efforts, she was extradited to our Public Security Bureau this afternoon. Ning Xiangnan, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, rewarded the two special agent teams of the bureau with 200 yuan for their efforts in handling this case. Ma Zhanshan will also give a reward. This time, a certain country offered a reward of 100,000 for assassinating Ma. The traitorous assassins, after receiving orders, waited a long time for an opportunity to strike but could not find one. They even waited for many days at Zhang Jiang Yuanxing's bathhouse in the British concession, where Ma was expected to go, planning to attack him when he came out of the bath. However, they failed because Ma was ill. Every day, someone disguised as a rickshaw puller waited in front of Ma's residence, but they still could not find a chance to act. Finally, they planned to rent a house. The special agent team had been investigating this case for a month before taking action on the 18th. At that time, the team members were all dressed as rickshaw pullers or electricians. They suddenly attacked unexpectedly. Each assassin carried one or two handguns in their sleeves, and because of their quick movements, the assassins were unable to fight back. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The individuals handed over to the Public Security Bureau by the British Municipal Council for the assassination attempt on Ma include: (1) Ma Dianchen, 33 years old, from Jiangsu province, former president of the Tianjin-Suzhou People's Hospital. He committed suicide out of fear of punishment and is now dead. (2) He Yuqing, 20 years old, from Jiangsu province. (3) Gao Li, 19 years old, from Henan province. (4) Xue Xiancai, 33 years old, from Shandong province. (5) Zheng Yufu, 26 years old, from Jiangsu province. (6) Wang Chengyun, 24 years old, from Shandong province. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 19th, the Japanese military headquarters stationed in Tianjin sent two military officers to the Hebei Provincial Government, intending to protest that the assassination attempt on Ma Zhanshan was instigated by the other side. Because Yu Xuezhong had already gone to Beiping, the meeting was fruitless, and they left. On the 18th, one of the assassins involved in the assassination attempt on Ma committed suicide out of fear of punishment when the officers tried to arrest him. He died in the hospital this afternoon. The arrested male and female assassins were handed over to the Public Security Bureau at 7:00 PM. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dispersed Soldiers of the 19th Route Army Arrive in Guangdong for Repatriation</h3>
<p>The old and weak are given travel expenses to return home.</p>
<p>The young and strong are added to various armies.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondent: Besides the part of the 19th Route Army that was incorporated by the central government and the part that joined the Guangdong side in Longyan and was reorganized into the Independent 3rd Brigade, there is another part that was not incorporated by either side and voluntarily chose to retire and return to their hometowns. This unit, originally stationed in Quanzhou and Hui'an in Fujian, consists of scattered soldiers from the 61st Division, the 19th Route Army Training Regiment, the 130th Brigade, and the 5th Army Supplementary Division, totaling over 2,000 people. Led by administrator Ni Jianchu, they returned south from Xiamen with two teams of military police from the 19th Route Army (these two teams of military police were borrowed from Guangdong by the 19th Route Army years ago). On the 8th, they took advantage of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng ship passing through Shantou. They landed in Shantou, and the Shantou Public Security Bureau sent a team to take care of them to maintain order, designating a place for them to temporarily stay. At the same time, the local charitable organization and Chamber of Commerce provided porridge for them. At 5:00 PM, the scattered soldiers returned to the ship and sailed to Guangzhou. On the morning of the 11th, the Xinfeng ship arrived at Huangpu waters in Guangzhou, where they landed and awaited repatriation. At around 7:00 PM, a small group of about a hundred people took a small boat to Guangzhou City, landing at the Tianzi Wharf, wandering around Yonghan South Road, Weixin Road, and the Bund area. The Provincial Public Security Bureau and Military Police Headquarters immediately sent a team to escort the hundred-odd scattered soldiers back to Huangpu. According to the scattered soldiers, most of them are from the West River and South Road districts of Guangdong Province. They previously belonged to Mao Weishou's unit of the 19th Route Army. They did not want to be reorganized this time, and the central government issued travel expenses of five or ten yuan, which has already been spent along the way. Although they have arrived in Guangzhou, they still have not been able to return to their hometowns, expressing unspeakable sadness. Later, the military police first sent the small group of scattered soldiers back to Huangpu for concentration, so that they could be repatriated. The next day, Chen Jitang immediately sent several staff officers and adjutants on electric boats to Huangpu to settle the scattered soldiers. The repatriation method was to first call the roll of each scattered soldier, ask them about their situation, and register them separately according to their age and health. Those who were old and weak were given ten yuan in travel expenses to return to their hometowns. Most of the young and strong were still willing to serve as soldiers, so their names were recorded in a roster, and they were assigned to fill vacancies in various armies according to their original positions. Chen Jitang ordered all army division and brigade commanders, and directors of rear affairs offices, to submit the number of vacancies in their units to the General Headquarters so that they could be selected and replenished. On the 13th, the rear personnel of various army divisions and brigades were sent to Huangpu to inspect and incorporate the soldiers and then send them to the front line to replenish the ranks. As for the supplementary soldiers under the First Army, they have been sent to Dayu to await distribution these past days. (February 15th)</p>
<h3>Assassination of Former Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Zhuang Jingke</h3>
<p>The perpetrators were four thugs.</p>
<p>Zhuang was shot dead on the spot.</p>
<p>Speculation on important background.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondent: At 10:00 PM on Lunar New Year's Eve, Zhuang Jingke, the former chargé d'affaires to Japan, who resided at No. 29, the corner of Akashi Street North and Fukushima Street in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, was suddenly broken into by four thugs and shot dead. Because it was the Lunar New Year holiday, few people knew about this incident. It is reported that Zhuang Jingke, courtesy name Jinggao, was from Minhou, Fujian. He graduated from the law department of Waseda University in Japan and successively served as a councilor and secretary of the Governor's Office of the Three Eastern Provinces, secretary of the Ministry of the Army, judge of the Supreme Court, director of the Ministry of Justice, and first-class secretary and chargé d'affaires of the Embassy in Japan. During Duan Qirui's administration, he was also an important figure in the Anfu Clique. When Chu Yupu governed Zhili, he once served as a special envoy for foreign affairs in Tianjin. After Chu's defeat, Zhuang retired and lived at home. Because he had studied law, he practiced law in Tianjin, handling civil and criminal litigation, with no shortage of cases entrusted to him. In his free time, he would invite former Anfu Clique figures such as Minister of Justice Yao Zhen, Vice Minister of Transportation Yao Guozhen, and his relative Zhu Yujun, the former Director-General of Transportation, to his residence to chat or play mahjong. A few days before Lunar New Year's Eve, Zhuang suddenly instructed his servant that a Mr. Chen would visit him soon. If he was home at the time, there was no need to report it; he could be invited in directly, as he had a litigation case to discuss. At about 10:00 PM on Lunar New Year's Eve, the servant heard someone knocking on the door. He asked for the name of the visitor through the door, who answered that he was Mr. Chen, here to discuss a case. The servant remembered his master's instructions and opened the door to welcome the guest. At that time, four strong men stood outside the door, looking fierce. Seeing the door open, two of them turned into the house to guard the door, while the other two rushed upstairs. They seemed very familiar with the route and went straight to the guest room on the third floor. At this time, Zhuang heard that the guest had arrived and stood in the hall to greet him. He glanced at the two men entering the hall and realized that he did not know them. Just as he was about to ask, the two strong men drew their guns and opened fire on Zhuang, firing several shots in succession, hitting him twice in the chest, once in the left arm, and once in the right neck. Zhuang was immediately splattered with blood and fell to the ground. After committing the crime, the two men ran back downstairs, joined the two men guarding the door, turned to the street corner, got into a car, and fled. At the time of the shooting, families were celebrating the New Year, and the sound of firecrackers was deafening. Although some people nearby heard the noise, they thought it was firecrackers and did not pay attention. It was not until a few minutes after the thugs left that the servant reported it to the Japanese police at the street corner, who relayed it to the special operations team of the Japanese police station. They conducted a search, but the thugs were long gone. The next day, the court received notification from the Japanese police station and sent prosecutor Hu to investigate, fill out a coroner's report, and file a case for wanted suspects. The body was placed in a coffin by Zhuang's son, Kaiyong, and his relative, Zeng Yujun. The wake was held on the 14th, the funeral on the 15th, and the burial on the 16th. According to general speculation, Zhuang's murder certainly has an important background: (1) Zhuang recently accepted a case involving the divorce lawsuit of Zhang Zongchang's twenty-first concubine. Zhang's twenty-first concubine, named Fugui, originally came from a brothel. Before joining Zhang, she had a flag in Tianjin. After Zhang's death, she was unwilling to be lonely and lived with Zhang's bodyguard as if they were husband and wife. Recently, the two had a falling out and could not continue their relationship. Fugui feared that the bodyguard would be a rogue and would harass her after the separation, so she hired Zhuang to handle the lawsuit. Zhuang had been handling this case for many days, and it was about to succeed. The bodyguard was bound to lose, so people suspect that Zhuang's murder may be related to this. (2) Although Zhuang was a lawyer, he had studied in Japan and served as a diplomat in Japan and had many dealings with Japanese people. Recently, Puyi usurped the title of Emperor in the Northeast. The traitors in Tianjin were plotting to respond at the time or make other expressions. Zhuang was working hard to win over these people, and it was said that he had illegal plans. Therefore, his tragic death has some political background. (16th)</p>
<h3>Xuzhou's Commercial Decline</h3>
<p>丨Numerous Business Closures Across Various Sectors丨</p>
<p>Xuzhou dispatch: Since the past few years, the commercial situation in Xuzhou has been declining, reaching its lowest point now. The fifth day of the new lunar year is the time for businesses to take stock, clean up, and reopen, marking the start of a year's operations. In previous years, countless new ventures would emerge, but now, many businesses are closing down at this time. The societal bankruptcy is evident. Here's a sector-by-sector breakdown based on our investigations: (1) Banking and Finance: Last year, due to bad debts from dealings with various clients in the banking sector, most loans could not be recovered. Pledged goods also couldn't be auctioned off due to low prices. Mortgage properties yielded meager returns, with no cash available. Therefore, banks have uniformly halted lending this year, only accepting deposits and not disbursing loans. Before the new year, only a small amount was loaned out under the county government's responsibility to maintain the clearing of banknotes and provide relief to the poor. All other loans were suspended. Local money shops, since the abolition of the "Gui Yuan" system, could neither issue banknotes nor operate as northern-style banks, so they had to close down. It's estimated that banks like Tongxinggong and Jucheng have already announced their closure. The financial situation this year is expected to be even tighter. (2) Southern Goods Businesses: This sector's capital has always been known to be substantial, leading all sectors. Its history in Xuzhou is also relatively long, with businesses clustered in the southern district. Names like Zhou Shunji, Zhuang Dingji, Yang Jianji, and Jiang Houji have long been known for their reliability, with Zhuang Houji's brand being the oldest, nearing a century. However, last year, it suffered total losses, and Jiang Houji has already announced its closure. Zhuang Dingji plans to use its property to offset debts but hasn't received creditor approval, so it's barely maintaining operations. This year, it's expected to be difficult to turn things around. (3) Silk, Satin, and Cloth Businesses: The sales market for silk fabrics and cotton yarn is mainly in rural areas. In recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, and purchasing power has disappeared, severely impacting business. Furthermore, foreign cloth and yarn have predominantly been Japanese goods. The blockade of sources has also made business difficult. Hengfeng Yarn Shop, Juyuan Silk Store, and others have closed down, totaling fifteen or sixteen establishments. There's absolutely no hope for revival this year. The vitality of the countryside cannot be restored in a short time, nor can the sales of yarn and cloth be smoothed in a short time either. (4) General Merchandise and Porcelain Businesses: This sector isn't confined to any particular type of product, which is better than other sectors with fixed scopes. However, there have been no profits to be made in recent years either. Newly opened stores like Fu Da Xiang and Zhi Da have all closed down. Only older brands like Tian Cheng, Tian Fu, Hua Feng Tai, and Yang Taiji can still maintain operations, but they are also tightening their belts significantly. (5) Book Businesses: Since the summer of last year, the competition between Shanghai Bookstore and Puyu Bookstore as distributors of Commercial Press books has led to massive price reductions. The World, China, Datong, and other bookstores were swept into the vortex, competing to sell, resulting in losses for all stores. (6) Pharmaceutical Businesses: The sales market for Western pharmaceuticals is also unreliable. Usually, venereal disease drugs sell well, but now, with societal decline and economic tightening, the number of people with these ailments has also decreased. Examining the total revenue of each pharmacy will reveal this. (7) Other Businesses: Although restaurants, tea houses, soy sauce, wine, tobacco, oil, and grain businesses sell daily necessities, their business has also decreased significantly due to the economic downturn, and their profits are meager. Comparatively, soy sauce, wine, and oil businesses fare slightly better because the value of food grains is very low, and the products they produce still have slightly better profits. However, due to the impact of these closures and declines, each store has reduced staff or completely shut down, resulting in the unemployment of three to four thousand people. This is truly a major danger to society, and each store employee's family is unknown, with how many people are dependent on their livelihood. This is an even greater social problem.

<h3>Wuhu's Rice and Finance Industries</h3>
<p>丨Extreme Decline in the Past Year丨</p>
<p>Yanhu dispatch: According to a survey after the conclusion of the Wuhu rice market, the amount exported to Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Yantai, and Ningbo last year was about two million piculs. In the past, the annual figure was consistently five to six million piculs. The fact that it has declined so much now is really due to the dumping of foreign rice. After the conclusion, the rice industry opened for business on the 16th. The price per bag increased by about four or five cents. Nanling high-grade rice was priced at four taels and four maces and one fen to two maces and four fen; Jiangbei high-grade rice was priced at four taels and one mace to four taels; medium-grade rice was priced at three taels, nine maces and two fen to eight maces and four fen; Nanling indica brown rice was priced at three taels, nine maces and two fen to eight maces and eight fen. Two years ago, there were still more than thirty money shops in Wuhu. Last year, there were only eleven, and only three or four of them actually did business with cargo stores. The rest were just open to collect debts, as they have already been monopolized by the banking sector. Yesterday, Tonghe Money Shop suddenly ran aground. This shop was one of the most well-established and historically significant money businesses in the area, with substantial capital. It went bankrupt due to excessive accounts receivable causing cash flow problems. After the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, the entire money industry is undergoing natural elimination and is about to disappear from the market. (18th)</p>
<h3>Verdict in Hankou Racecourse Robbery Case</h3>
<p>丨Four Robbers, Wang, Xue, Ding, and Tian, All Sentenced to Death丨</p>
<p>丨Three People, Including Yang Huaizhi, Acquitted丨</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The Hankou International Racecourse robbery case, which was cracked through a design by the garrison headquarters, resulted in the arrest of four robbers, Wang Xianzhang, Xue Yaoting, Ding Yuzhai, and Tian Huating. After interrogation by the military court, they were found guilty and sentenced according to the law. The execution will take place soon. The main points of the verdict are as follows: Wang Xianzhang hid in the concession, using it as a shield. He specialized in selling morphine, and his crime is unforgivable. Putting aside the case itself, he gathered bandits in his residence beforehand to plan the robbery and divided the loot in his residence afterward. It can be seen that Wang's residence was the main camp for the accomplices in this case, and Wang himself was the mastermind and principal offender in this case. Xue Yaoting was responsible for the firearms and had planned for a long time. He confessed to the stolen money, and the amount was significant. He is an important principal offender, on par with Wang. Both should be sentenced to death in accordance with Article 43 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Section 9 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits. Ding and Tian, both armed with firearms, carried out the robbery and subsequently divided the loot. Although the shooting and killing of the bandit Qi Chang can be seen as divine justice, it also shows the viciousness of these individuals. They should also be sentenced to death in accordance with the law for their involvement in robbery and dividing the loot. Yang Huaizhi has no fixed occupation and has long been a local rogue in Hankou. He was arrested due to mistaken identity and nearly suffered an injustice due to a car driver's false testimony. However, thanks to his help in capturing several principal offenders, all of whom said Yang was not involved, he had no criminal act. Tian Zijing and Tian Zihou, although from the same village and clan as the bandit Tian, did not participate and even pointed out the bandit Tian, showing they had no ulterior motives. Both were acquitted. Guo Wenqi received money sent by the bandit Ding, knowing its source, and showed no regard for the law. He should be sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months. Zhang Yaonan's possession of two pistols for safekeeping and a damaged gun handed over to the Anlu County Office should be confiscated. Guo Wenqi possessed 270 yuan of stolen money sent by the bandit Ding, and Xue confessed to depositing 340 yuan of stolen money from the Central China Bank and 1,200 yuan of stolen money from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, which were confirmed to be items stolen from the racecourse. All should be returned in full. (February 18th)</p>

<h3>Defense Corps Captures Bandits and Sends Them to the County</h3>
<p>Yangqiao Temple in Xiaokunshan Township, the 9th district of the county, has no monks or Taoists residing there. It is only inhabited by Zhuang Mo, a pious village woman who manages the incense. It was previously robbed and burglarized, but the case has not been solved. Unexpectedly, at 10 PM on the 13th, five bandits armed with guns suddenly came again, broke into the temple, tied up Mo Zhuang, and ransacked the place before leaving. The next morning, the incident was reported to the sub-station for investigation. Inspector Liu Binchen, along with the district chief of the defense corps, Xia Shutian, went to investigate. Yu Bolu, a training officer at the district headquarters, was also patrolling the Yangqiao riverside area when he saw a houseboat on the river that looked suspicious. The bandits, seeing the training officer, were afraid they were being pursued and fired shots in resistance. After about several minutes, as it was nighttime, the villagers sounded gongs to surround and capture them. Two of the bandits went ashore and fled, but Yu, the training officer, captured two of them, identified as Yao Hecheng and Shi Aqi. They denied the allegations, but the plaintiff, Zhuang Mo, identified Yao Hecheng as one of the robbers. After recording the confession, along with a bandit boat, a report was prepared and sent to the county government for verification and handling.</p>

<h3>Four Businesses Announce Liquidation</h3>
<p>Due to continuous years of disasters and poor harvests in this county, all industries are declining. Following the liquidation of Jitai Pawnshop in the city on New Year's Eve, four more businesses, Wanchengxiang Southern Goods Store, Tongchangxiang Southern Goods Store, Deyuantai Silk and Cloth Store, and Zhengtai Silk and Cloth Store, officially announced liquidation on the 18th.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Several Rice Businesses Close</h3>
<p>Various industries in Suzhou have successively opened for business since the 19th. In the rice industry, after the year-end settlement, except for Yuanfengyi, Jiutaiyi, Daji, and several other stores that closed, most others were able to maintain operations. A few, such as Zhenlonghong and Yitai, had surpluses. The county has a total of over 300,000 piculs of rice in stock, and rice stores also have over 100,000 piculs in stock. However, it is a matter of concern that the rural areas in the four townships have depleted their reserves. Also, because urban women are cutting their hair and rural areas are bankrupt, the number of customers for jewelry has decreased. Tongfengyong Gold Shop in West Central Market has announced its closure.</p>
<h3>Villagers Robbed in Yinshan Township</h3>
<p>Xu Shisheng's house in Beibang Village, Yinshan, was suddenly robbed by more than ten bandits in the middle of the night the other day. Xu resisted the bandits, and they injured his head and back. It is estimated that over a hundred yuan worth of clothing, jewelry, and cash were stolen. Then the bandits went to Xu Shaopeng's house nearby and robbed him before escaping north.</p>
<h3>Ban on Flower Drum Opera</h3>
<p>The New Central Theater in North Bureau was performing a flower drum opera with lewd content, with men and women mixed together, singing obscene songs, which was harmful to public morals. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau ordered a ban, and violators will be arrested.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>Ye Chucang Visits Wuxi for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Ye Chucang arrived in Wuxi by train from Beijing the afternoon before yesterday. Accompanied by County Magistrate Yan, he visited famous scenic spots such as Yuantouzhu, Xiaojishan, and Meiyuan. He stayed at the Meiyuan Taihu Hotel that night and left Wuxi by train to return to Beijing yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Car Accident Caused by Damaged Vehicle</h3>
<p>Yesterday (19th) at 11 AM, a car with license number 269, carrying eight passengers from the city to Jiangyin, was driving through Yangsibatou in the 5th district of this county. A screw suddenly fell off the car, causing it to drive into a field and injure passenger Lu Meisheng's left foot. Other passengers only suffered minor injuries. The driver immediately called for another car to take the injured person to Jiangyin Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Grain Merchants Oppose Commission Increase</h3>
<p>Wuxi Rice, Bean, and Miscellaneous Grain Association saw a sharp fall in prices and poor business last year, while expenses were increasing daily. The original 99% exchange rate was insufficient to cover costs. It was previously resolved to increase the exchange rate to 98.4%, but the 8th district association failed to agree, and the change could not be implemented. After repeated consultations and a joint effort with the Wujin association, it was unanimously decided that from February 18th, all rice, paddy, wheat, yellow mung beans, and other miscellaneous grains would be converted to a 98.4% exchange rate. A public announcement was made in the newspaper. However, the Bengbu Rice Merchants Association, the Bengbu Transportation Association, and the Jiangsu Bengbu Grain Merchants Association stated that during this time of rural economic collapse, grain prices were falling, and farmers and merchants were struggling. Yellow beans are oilseeds and cannot be compared to grains. In recent years, bean prices have fallen more sharply than in the past, while transportation costs have increased instead of decreasing. Selling prices cannot improve, and various losses have become unsustainable. Yesterday, they submitted separate petitions to the Wuxi and Changzhou county governments, requesting a ban. At the same time, they appointed Sun Yuanfu, Li Peisheng, and Qian Xiaosheng as representatives to directly negotiate with the rice, bean, and miscellaneous grain associations in Wuxi and Changzhou, and telegraphed the county government and chamber of commerce, requesting assistance in addressing the difficulties.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<h3>Scant Profits for the Finance Industry</h3>
<p>The Yangzhou finance industry plummeted last year. Few businesses made a profit this year. Today (18th), only a dozen or so businesses, including Dachang (a reorganized Shengyuan), reopened as usual. In addition, Yuanchang is still under consideration by its shareholders. Liu Jingyi, who previously ran Kaibaoxing Fuyi, has recovered the store and property and plans to resume business in March. Hongda Mostly Stores Hengchang Zengfu on Jiaochang Street have all confirmed their closure.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Recover Confiscated Reclaimed Land</h3>
<p>The provincial government, after investigation by provincial and ministry committees, has determined that Xu Daochun of Nantong has illegally occupied 1,500 mu of Liuhaisha reclaimed land. All of it has been confiscated and sold, and the money will be deposited into the national treasury. However, Xu resisted and was detained in the county government for over a year. Now, the provincial government has ordered County Magistrate Cheng to execute the order. Xu Daochun has complied with the order to hand over the land and will be released immediately.</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<h3>County Government Orders Payment of Overdue Rent</h3>
<p>Since taking office, the new County Magistrate of this county, Yang Zhanchun, has paid special attention to the land tax. Recognizing that the tax comes from rent, he wants to actively rectify the land tax by first rectifying land rent. He has specifically ordered all detained tenant farmers who are being held for owing rent this year to provide reliable shopkeepers as guarantors for their release, but they must pay the full amount within half a month, otherwise they will be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Bandits Arrested</h3>
<p>A few days ago, the farmer Meng Youfa's house in Zhuxiaowan, this county, was broken into by more than ten bandits, who ransacked the place, losing a lot of cash and clothing. Before leaving, they kidnapped Meng's son, Baisheng. The Meng family prepared money, contacted them, and paid a ransom for his release. Yesterday, the 7th Water Police Team sent police to track down and arrest three of the kidnappers, Meng Agen, Qi Zhongguang, and others, and brought them to the county. County Magistrate Yang personally interrogated them and has now transferred them to the court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<h3>Qianjiang Ferry Passenger Statistics</h3>
<p>Due to the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road, passengers on the Qianjiang ferry in Xiaoshan mostly took the ferry, and the number of business cars decreased in 1932, so the number of ferry passengers suddenly increased. The total number of ferry passengers for the whole year was 5,819,316, with a daily average of 15,943, an increase of one-third over the previous year.</p>

<h3>Mourning for the Death of the Belgian King</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and others visited the Belgian Consulate General yesterday to express condolences</p>
<p>All agencies lowered flags to half-mast for three days starting yesterday</p>
<p>After the sad news of the death of King Albert I of Belgium spread, all countries around the world mourned in unison. Our country has also sent a telegram to the Belgian Queen to express condolences. At the same time, all Chinese and foreign agencies in the city lowered their flags to half-mast for three days starting yesterday to show their mourning.

<p>Belgian Consulate Reception Yesterday morning and afternoon, dignitaries from various Chinese and foreign agencies in this city visited the Belgian Consulate on Route Lafayette in the French Concession to express their condolences.

According to sources from the Consular Corps, the consulates of all countries will lower their flags to half-mast for three days, starting yesterday and resuming their original flag positions on the 22nd of this month. In addition, the Catholic Church in the French Concession also held prayers for the Belgian King yesterday. The Ta Mei Evening News reported that this morning (19th), the British naval authorities stationed in Shanghai received orders to fly all the ships under their command at half-mast to express their condolences for the death of King Albert of Belgium. The period is subject to further orders. It is expected that warships from other countries will receive similar orders sooner or later, as all countries in the world are now mourning the late King of Belgium.</p>
<p>Belgian Envoy's Memorial The Continental Daily reported that Fang Fei, the acting Belgian Consul General in Shanghai, intends to postpone the memorial service for King Albert of Belgium until the Belgian Minister to China, Ji Youmu, arrives in Shanghai from Beijing within a few days. It is said that they are currently discussing holding a memorial service at St. Joseph's Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Xie Shoukang's Telegram Former Minister to Belgium Dr. Xie Shoukang had a very close relationship with the royal family during his tenure. After hearing the news, he personally went to the Belgian Embassy to express condolences and sent a telegram to the Belgian Queen. The text is as follows: "The late King fostered friendly relations between China and Belgium, which I deeply admire. I am overwhelmed with sorrow at this unexpected event. I beg you to accept my condolences and maintain the country."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Stay in Beijing for About a Week</p>
<p>Will Go Directly to Hankou to Assume New Position</p>
<p>The newly appointed Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, Zhang Xueliang, accompanied by his secretary Wu Jiaxiang, Shen Zutong, Adjutant General Tang Guozhen, Guard Captain Tan Hai, advisor Donner, and others, took the night train to Beijing last night. They boarded the train from Zhenru Station. According to Zhang's staff, Zhang plans to stay in Beijing for about a week, meeting with various central authorities, and then go directly to Hankou to take up his new post. As for the timing of his trip north to visit his family, it will be decided after he takes office.</p>
<h3>Li Du Returns to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The decision to go to Xinjiang is made by the Central Government</p>
<p>Three Ways to Settle the Families of Soldiers</p>
<p>General Li Du, the former commander of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, went to Tianjin to meet with General Ma Zhanshan. Having completed his business, he left Tianjin and returned to Shanghai. The National News Agency reporter met Mr. Wang Ziyao, the former chief of staff of the army, at his residence on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday. According to the conversation, General Li will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. The recorded details of the conversation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Welcoming Li to Xinjiang</h3>
<p>After the reporter met Mr. Wang, he first inquired about Li's trip to Xinjiang to gather his old troops. Wang replied that a month ago, Li, seeing that his troops in Xinjiang had no one in charge, had the intention to go there. Also, the new province sent a telegram expressing welcome, saying that the situation surrounding provincial governor Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying was complicated, that the troops and officers stationed in the border area numbered ten thousand, and that they hoped he would come to Xinjiang to gather them and await review by the Central Government. Therefore, General Li had the intention to go to Xinjiang, but whether he would enter Xinjiang must be decided by the Central Government. If the Central Government orders him to go, he will set off immediately. General Li received a telegram the day before yesterday, saying that he was allowed to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th. As for the troops remaining in Xinjiang, there are more than 8,600, of which more than 2,100 are the old troops of General Su Bingwen, who are commanded by the Jilin Office. The rest are from the Jilin Self-Defense Army, led by Commander Zheng Runcheng. Currently, all supplies and clothing are provided by Chairman Sheng, but each soldier only receives one yuan per month in salary, so their lives are extremely difficult. They all hope that the Central Government can quickly reorganize them formally.</p>
<h3>Families Stranded in Tianjin and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Afterward, Mr. Wang told the reporter that a total of 340 families of Jilin officers and soldiers who fled from the Northeast to Russia are currently in Shanghai, nearly 200 in Tianjin, and over 40 in Beiping. Most of these families have men still in Xinjiang, so the problem of livelihood is extremely difficult to solve. Of these 340 people, one-third are families of General Su's troops. Wang's (Wang referring to himself) stay in Shanghai is also due to being held up by handling this matter. Now, three methods of settlement have been sought and submitted to the Central Government, because the Central Government cannot bear to see the families of meritorious soldiers in the Northeast continue to be displaced. The methods are divided into three steps: (1) Settle the officers, who can earn money themselves, so their families will not worry about poverty. (2) Send the families to Xinjiang, because most of the female relatives have husbands who are still stationed far away. (3) Find ways to support themselves. Among these three methods, the third, supporting themselves, is the most difficult, because Jilin people face great difficulties in finding work in East China due to language barriers. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find a way out due to unfamiliarity with the area. Therefore, this matter is currently being handled by me, and I believe that a better solution will be found in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company Tests Ping-Shan Line</h3>
<p>Li Jingcong Flew from Ping to Bing Yesterday</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation is planning to open the Ping-Shan and Yue-Shan air routes. General Manager Li Jingcong went to Beiping in person. Yesterday afternoon, he took off from Ping on a test flight, passing through Taiyuan and arriving in Xi'an. Then, he flew back to Shanghai from Shan via Hankou. After staying in Shanghai for a day or two, he will go to Guangdong to inspect the airport. For the time being, the Northwest trunk line cannot reach Xinjiang. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ping-Shan Test Flight To open the Ping-Shan air route, Eurasia Aviation is conducting a preliminary test flight. General Manager Li Jingcong arrived in Beiping a few days ago. The second test flight plane flew to Beiping last Saturday. It was originally scheduled to take off from Ping today (Tuesday), but Li was eager to prepare for the opening of the Ping-Shan and Yue-Shan routes, so he advanced the takeoff to yesterday. He left Ping at around 1 PM, arrived in Taiyuan that day, and stayed to discuss airport and station establishment matters. Then he left Bing and flew to Xi'an. After arriving in Xi'an, he took the original plane along the planned Yue-Shan air route via Xiangyang and arrived in Hankou, and then returned to Shanghai east.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Airport The Yue-Shan line was originally scheduled to open on the 6th of this month, but the Guangdong Provincial Government said that it was inconvenient for civil aviation to borrow the Guangzhou Shougouling military airfield. Guangzhou originally planned to add a civil airport, and the site has been designated. The Guangzhou Municipal Government was ordered to expedite construction so that it could be completed as soon as possible and used for the Yue-Shan air route aircraft to land. As a result, it was temporarily unable to open. Later, there was a suggestion that the racetrack could be temporarily borrowed. The company believes that whether the racetrack is suitable and when the civil airport can be completed both require on-site inspection. Therefore, General Manager Li Jingzong, after returning to Shanghai from Hankou, will spend a day or two and then go to Guangdong with the engineers to open the Yue-Shan line as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Resuming Flights to Xinjiang Previous reports said that Nanjing Electric reported that Sheng Shicai had telegraphed the Eurasia Company requesting to resume flights to Dihua before the 28th of this month. Yesterday, a newspaper also reported that the company was already preparing for this. According to Secretary Cha Zhen of the company, speaking to the New Voice News reporter, the company has been planning to resume flights to Xinjiang all the time. However, in fact, it has been unable to proceed due to the ongoing war. The Hami station between Dihua and Gansu is still under the control of Ma Zhongying. With the war not yet over, it is difficult to achieve for the time being. As for Sheng Shicai's telegram request, the company has not yet received it.</p>
<h3>Zheng Baozhao Transferred to Deputy Director of Beining Railway</h3>
<p>Xiao Weiguo Appointed Director of Car Affairs of the Two Railways</p>
<p>Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director of Car Affairs of the Two Railways, was ordered to be transferred to Deputy Director of the Beining Railway. The vacancy will be filled by Xiao Weiguo, the secretary of the railway. Xie Wenlong, Deputy Director of Car Affairs and Head of Business Section, has been reassigned, and the vacancy will be filled by Wang Zhigang, Head of Transportation Section of the Car Affairs Office, who will also hold his original position. Yuan Shaochang, Deputy Director of Car Affairs, will also lead the Business Section. According to Zheng Baozhao, he has received the transfer order and will go to Beijing within a week to report to the Ministry of Railways and then go north to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Municipal Defense Committee Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Members Swore an Oath of Office at the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Yang Hu and Two Others Were Elected as Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>The Municipal Defense Corps has a glorious history of defending the area and assisting military police in maintaining public order for decades. However, due to the influence of the situation over the years, it has not been able to actively proceed in strengthening its organization and strengthening its forces. Mayor Wu, recognizing this, drafted the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee Organizational Rules last year, which he consulted with the Municipal Provisional Council and passed. He also hired Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yao Mulian, Wang Binyan, Luo Weixiong, Wang Yansong, Yang Hu, Wen Hongen, Wu Xingya, and others as members. At 10:10 AM yesterday</p>
<p>Ten, at the expanded memorial week in the new city government auditorium in the city center, the establishment ceremony of the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee was held.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of Committee Members</h3>
<p>Yesterday's attendees included Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Committee Members Yao Mulian, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Binyan, Yang Hu, Wu Xingya, Wen Hongen, Du Yuesheng, and over forty others, including the heads and deputies of various district corps from the entire city. Staff members Wang Yansong and Luo Weixiong were absent due to matters requiring them to leave Shanghai. Mayor Wu, as chairman, presided over the ceremony, and the committee members took their oaths of office. The oath read: "I solemnly swear that I will respectfully adhere to the will of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, obey the principles of the party, follow the directives of the central government and higher authorities, respect the public opinion of the local people, and be loyal and diligent in my duties. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath."</p>
<h3>Mayor's Address</h3>
<p>After the swearing-in ceremony, Chairman and Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying, "Fellow comrades, today marks the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee, and the members have been sworn into office. In his entire body of teachings, the late Premier Sun Yat-sen very specifically instructed us that the process of nation-building should be based on local self-government as the fundamental task, and that local self-defense is one of the prerequisites for local self-government. Therefore, the Outline of National Reconstruction clearly states that local autonomy can only be discussed once local defense and security are properly managed. The defense corps is a force for local self-defense and an organization for local security. Although our Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps has a long and glorious history, due to various factors such as time, financial resources, and local incidents, its organization and training have not met the expectations of the citizens of Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Government, based on the Provisional Regulations for Local Defense Organizations promulgated by the central government, has drafted the organizational rules for the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee, which have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Provisional Council. This committee is hereby established today, and all members are sworn into office. From now on, all members should work together with the government to shoulder the heavy responsibility of local self-defense, and gradually improve and strengthen the organization and capabilities of the local defense corps, in order to promote the completion of local autonomy. How to reorganize and improve the defense corps in the future is not only the responsibility of all committee members, but also requires soliciting the opinions of all parties in the local community to ensure that we fulfill our mission. This is what the Shanghai Municipal Defense Committee hopes for from all sectors of the city upon its establishment today."</p>

<h3>Yang Shuzhuang's Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, Wu Tiecheng, and others personally helped with the coffin.</p>
<p>The coffin was transported by the Tongji warship to Fujian.</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Nationalist Government and a naval veteran, passed away at his Shanghai residence on the 10th of last month. His coffin was temporarily placed in the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. After the Nationalist Government issued an order for a public funeral, the funeral was held yesterday afternoon, and the coffin was transported back to his ancestral home in Fujian by the Tongji warship. Yesterday's funeral was exceptionally grand, with the Minister of the Navy, Chen Shaokuan, leading all officers and men along the way, totaling no less than twenty thousand people. At 5:00 PM, the coffin arrived at the Tongji warship below Gaochang Temple. At 7:00 PM, a banquet was held at the Yizhixiang Western Restaurant on Fourth Avenue to entertain guests from all walks of life who assisted with the funeral.</p>

<p>Grand Ceremony: The funeral procession was very grand and solemn. The Public Security Bureau dispatched a police brigade, a mobile patrol team, and police officers from the first and second districts, armed to maintain order along the route and maintain strict security. The French Concession police also sent Chinese and foreign detectives to guard the Minguo Road area. The procession began at 1:00 PM, and preparation was made for the departure from Laobeimen to Xinkai Road, a distance of about one mile. The procession began at 2:00 PM. Many citizens lined the streets to watch, causing traffic congestion. The trams on Fahua Third Road were temporarily suspended. The route departed from Xinkaihe, passed through Zhonghua Road, turned onto Shangwen Road, entered Daxing Street, Chezhan Hou Road, turned onto Hu Min Nan Ku Road, entered Chezhan Road Yingpan Road, and finally reached Gaochang Temple Wharf. Guests assisting with the funeral procession dispersed from the Siming Guild Hall on Minguo Road to the entrance of the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Corps.</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Order: The procession was led by the police brigade and mobile patrol team of the Public Security Bureau, with the flags of the party and nation, and the personal standard of Yang Shuzhuang, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Nationalist Government and Admiral of the Navy, carried by soldiers of the Hairong warship riding white horses.

The coffin was surrounded by sailors from the Hairong warship, providing tight security. At the end were sailors from the Hairong and Tongji warships, followed by cars for female relatives, all of which were green cars from the Xiang Sheng Company.</p>

At yesterday's funeral, Yang's two daughters, Lingshu and Xinshu, escorted the coffin. At 5:30 PM, they arrived at Gaochang Temple and lowered it onto the Tongji warship. The ship was docked at the shipyard wharf and had already been fired up, ready to depart. Today it will load coal, and on the 22nd, it will set sail.

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Increases Flights on Two Routes</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation has been actively expanding its business on its existing routes. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Section</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong route has always been very crowded. Only the No. 16 Stinson aircraft was damaged near Zhabu, so only the No. 17 Stinson aircraft flew back and forth on the route, which was quite overwhelming. Now, a new twin-engine aircraft newly purchased from the United States has arrived in Shanghai, and it will be fully assembled soon. Once the test flight is satisfactory, it will be added to the Shanghai-Guangdong route. The company has scheduled flights from Shanghai to Guangdong every Tuesday and Friday, and from Guangdong to Shanghai every Wednesday and Saturday. The plan to fly the new aircraft to Guangdong on the 23rd of this month has been postponed to early March because the new aircraft is not yet fully assembled, so the plan to fly twice a week will be implemented.</p>
<h3>Hankou-Chongqing Route</h3>
<p>The number of passengers and detailed items on the section from Hankou to Chongqing on the company's Shanghai-Chengdu route are extremely crowded. The company has decided to increase the number of flights on this section by one per week, with flights from Hankou to Chongqing every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and flights from Chongqing to Hankou every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. As for the implementation date, it is also expected to be in early March.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Station</h3>
<p>The company's planned China-Philippines route, which has been test-flown once, uses Hong Kong and Manila as important transit stations. The negotiations for setting up a station in Hong Kong have been discussed many times. However, the rumor that the company's senior executive, Mr. Bixby, went to Hankou to negotiate is not true. Mr. Bixby, an American director of the company, returned to the United States for personal reasons two months ago and has not yet come to China.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Arima to Go to Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador to China, Akira Ariyoshi, will leave Shanghai for Beijing on the 11:00 PM Shanghai-Beijing express train tonight, accompanied by Counselor Horiuchi and Chinese Secretary Arino, due to negotiations on issues in North China. According to Mr. Arino, Ariyoshi's trip to Beijing has no specific task, but is merely a routine visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After arriving in Beijing, he will stay for about a day and then return to Shanghai. As for his return to Japan, he has this intention, but the date has not yet been determined. It is expected to be in March or April. Arino did not explicitly state the specific task of the ambassador's trip, and denied the various pending issues in North China as reported in the newspapers.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Announces Discovery of Gold Dust in Rivers of Jixi County</h3>
<p>Farmers Pan for Gold to Make a Living</p>
<p>According to a message released yesterday by the International Trade Bureau, in addition to the abundant timber production in the mountains of various counties in Anhui Province, the coal reserves are also extremely rich. However, the metallic mineral content in the sandy and gravelly mountains and various rivers is also not insignificant, but due to inconvenient transportation, few people pay attention to mining, resulting in the good resources being buried underground for a long time. Recently, a large amount of gold dust ore was discovered in the 15th District of Jixi County, located at the foot of Li Da Cen under Wanduan Jinguang Cen. Gold dust is found in the river about thirty miles from Cen Jiao to Ge Xi. In recent years, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, no less than four or five hundred farmers in the vicinity have been panning for gold to make a living. The total value of gold obtained by the farmers is also four or five thousand yuan. Zhang Jiesheng, the head of the county's construction department, recently went to the area to investigate and drafted a report to the authorities to find ways to mine it. In the future, when the Wuhu-Tunxi highway is completed and transportation is convenient, if we can actively raise funds for mining and refining, it will be a great source of profit.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Committee Schedules Executive Committee Meeting</h3>

Yesterday, the center negotiated with the Sanbei Company and obtained permission to load the goods onto the Changjiang ship "Xingshi" today for transport to Hankou for exhibition. Recently, a large number of inferior goods have been transported to Wuhan, so promoting national goods is especially urgent.</p>
<h3>After the Shanghai-Beiping Through Train Service, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Assigned Passenger Cars</h3>
<p>Trial Run to Zhapei Tomorrow</p>
<p>After the opening of the Shanghai-Beiping through train service, the seven passenger cars used for it were transferred from the Tianjin-Pukou and other railways. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway assigned the Wusong Locomotive Factory to assemble one set of cars itself. It is now learned that it has been assembled and will be run to Zhabei tomorrow (20th) for a trial run. On the 22nd, it will return to the North Station, and at 10:00 AM, all sectors of society will be invited to visit. In addition to the first and second class sleeping cars, first, second, and third class passenger cars, and luggage cars, the train also has a dining car for passengers to eat in. The interior of each car is very comfortable and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Federation of Trade Unions Went to Beijing Last Night to Petition the Central Government</h3>
<p>Trade Unions Jointly Petition for Amendment of the Trade Union Law</p>
<p>In order to request the central government to decide on the representatives to the upcoming International Labour Conference and to demand the amendment of the Trade Union Law, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, after deliberation at its standing committee meeting, appointed Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Long Peiyun, and Shao Xubai as committee members to go to Beijing to petition. The representatives have already taken the petition and boarded the night express train to Beijing last night. Many trade union representatives went to the station to see them off. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>The federation believes that the upcoming International Labour Conference is about to open, but the labor representatives have not yet been determined. Previously, it had telegraphed the central government, suggesting that one to three people be elected by the labor circles in various places, and then one person be selected by the central government, but this was not adopted. The federation believes that the conference is imminent, and it is deeply concerned that the central government will temporarily appoint representatives who do not conform to the public opinion of the labor circles, so it specially appointed Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, and Li Mengnan as committee members to go to Beijing to petition the Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Industry. At the same time, the various trade unions in the city, regarding the organizational problems of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, jointly prepared a petition requesting the amendment of the Trade Union Law. The petition was also handed over to the representatives to take to Beijing. The representatives boarded the night express train to Beijing last night. Representatives of various trade unions, including Zhu Xuefan, Ye Xianggao, Fan Yifeng, Su Shaotao, Zhang Linhua, Liu Xinquan, and Zhao Zhenhui, all went to the station to welcome them and took photos at the North Station to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3>Petition</h3>
<p>To the Central Committee, regarding the matter of submitting a petition: We humbly note that the 18th International Labour Conference is about to open, and our government representatives have already been appointed. However, in previous sessions, the labor representatives were often not prepared in advance, and were either temporarily appointed by members of the Central Committee or designated by the government. As a result, the representatives attending the conference may have had no connection with the labor circles, which not only violates the provisions of the International Labour Organization's regulations, but also concerns the national image and invites ridicule from other countries. The federation, in view of this, telegraphed the Ministry a few days ago, suggesting that the labor representatives for this session should be genuine workers with full experience elected by the labor circles in various places, one to three people, and then one person should be selected by the government as the attending representative, to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous sessions. Now that the conference is imminent, the Ministry has not yet decided on a plan, so we have specially prepared a document and appointed representatives Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan, Shao Xubai, Long Peiyun, etc. to go to Beijing to petition. We humbly request that the Ministry (committees) comply with public opinion and allow the representatives to be selected by the labor circles in various places for this conference. We are extremely urgent in presenting this matter. We respectfully submit this petition.</p>
<h3>Trade Union Petitions</h3>
<p>Various trade unions jointly petition the Central Party Department to amend the Trade Union Law, stating: Regarding the matter of requesting that the Legislative Yuan be consulted to promptly amend the Trade Union Law, it is necessary to expressly stipulate that each province and city may organize a Federation of Trade Unions, and to maintain the original organization of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, so as to maintain the labor movement and benefit the revolution. After the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, only the organization of federations of various industry trade unions was permitted, and there was no provision for the organization of a Federation of Trade Unions. Labor circles and party departments in various provinces and cities deeply know that the promulgation of the regulations will cause major obstacles to the future of the labor movement, so they were panicked and repeatedly petitioned for amendments, but they were not approved. As of today, the labor movement in various places has fallen into a state of depression due to the restrictions of the law, and the facts are all there, so it is difficult to avoid mentioning them. After the September 18th Incident, the labor circles in the city are increasingly concerned about the foreign invasion, and the national fortune is declining. In order to jointly rescue the crisis, it is believed that it is impossible to succeed without aligning our steps and uniting as one. Therefore, a resolution was passed by the general assembly of representatives of various trade unions in the city, and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions was established. On October 2nd of last year, it was approved by the Shanghai Special City Party Department to be temporarily registered. Since the establishment of the Federation of Trade Unions, it has been three years. Because its leadership is appropriate and its command is effective, the actions of our labor circles have gradually become consistent, and their strength has also become concentrated. The depressed and chaotic labor movement in the city has been reborn and revived. Moreover, after investigation, the actions of the Federation of Trade Unions are all based on the principles of our party, and they have made their greatest efforts to cope with the national crisis. In addition, they have spared no effort in preventing communist activities, eliminating disputes in various industries to stabilize society, assisting pure worker organizations to form trade unions to increase the strength of our party, and holding labor education lectures and labor supplementary night schools to increase worker knowledge. The past achievements are well known to the labor circles throughout the city, so the affiliated associations have unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for the Federation of Trade Unions. Unexpectedly, the Central People's Movement Committee recently ordered the name of the Federation of Trade Unions to be changed to the "National Salvation Federation of Various Industry Trade Unions" on the grounds that the Federation of Trade Unions has no legal basis, and the organization of the Federation of Trade Unions was virtually abolished. The affiliated associations were shocked and panicked to hear this. We humbly believe that the law is based on facts. The organization of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions is the consistent demand of the labor circles throughout the city, and the past facts prove that it is necessary for its existence. Therefore, the law should adapt to the environment and provide explicit provisions based on the needs of the facts. Furthermore, the law is based on the principle of equality. After investigation, all sectors of agriculture, commerce, and academia have general organizational provisions such as city agricultural associations, city chambers of commerce, and student federations. Only our labor circles are not allowed to have a general organization of a Federation of Trade Unions. How can this be said to be fair? The affiliated associations jointly submitted a report to the Fourth Plenary Session to request relief, but it was not submitted for discussion. We will reiterate the facts and state the reasons in detail, and jointly prepare a document to sincerely request your association to consult the Legislative Yuan to quickly amend the Trade Union Law and stipulate explicitly that each province and city may organize a Federation of Trade Unions, or promulgate a separate organizational regulation for the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. Before the new law is promulgated, please maintain the original organization of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. The future of the labor movement is deeply reliant on it. We are extremely urgent in presenting this matter. We respectfully submit this to the Executive Committee of the Central Party Department. The following ninety-odd trade unions: Shanghai Six Districts Public Bus, Second District Rubber, Liang Industry Occupation, Five District Papermaking, Four District Papermaking, Rice Vehicle Industry, Six District Paint Making, Native Product Industry, Ship Wood Industry, Running Shoe Upper Industry, Military Uniform Industry, Postal Workers, Postal Workers, Six District Cotton Weaving, Four District Silk Reeling, Six District Silk Reeling, Leather Making Industry, Two District Knitting, Towing Industry, Three District Rubber, One District Cleaning, Five District Shipbuilding, Six District Water and Electricity, Four District Water and Wood, Six District Tea Making, Silver Building, Four District Cleaning, Four District Cotton Weaving, Four District Cigarette Rolling, Ten District Cotton Spinning, Four District Transport Towing, Four District Electrical Appliances, Sauce Industry, One District Water and Electricity, Candle Industry, One District Shipbuilding, Shanghai Ningbo Wheel Tea Room, Pharmaceutical Industry, Three District Cotton Spinning, Toothbrush Industry, Four District Rubber, Newspaper Delivery, Automobile Driver, Garment, Nine District Soap Medicine, Bristle, One District Cosmetics, One District Water and Wood, Rice Husk, Fresh Pig, Sampan Households, Ink Making, Five District Cotton Spinning, Husk Rice, Civil Ship Wood Industry, Winemaking, Duck Slaughtering, Five District Water and Wood, Five District Cigarette Rolling, Cured Meat, Aluminumware, Gas, New Year Red Electric Light, Incense Industry, One District Rubber, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry, Stone Printing, Shoemaking Industry.</p>
<h3>Domestic Celebrities Regularly Commemorate Chen Qubing</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Chen Qubing of Wujiang was a pioneer of the Party and the nation. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, he was engaged in the revolution. When Premier Sun Yat-sen organized the Tongmenghui in Tokyo, he followed him closely and participated in the revolutionary work to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty. He also reorganized the Nanshe with Liu Yazi and others to advocate racial revolution through writing. At one time, domestic celebrities such as Song Yufu, Huang Xing, Yu Youren, and Dai Jitao responded and joined the organization, reaching more than a thousand people. It was the only propaganda organization of the Tongmenghui in the country. After the Xinhai Revolution, all domestic cultural groups, such as major daily newspapers and universities, mainly used members of the Nanshe as their main members. Mr. Chen had high aspirations and integrity, and did not take credit for his achievements. Except for once serving as a consultant to the Presidential Palace and a secretary to the Grand Marshal's Office, he rejected officialdom and devoted his life to teaching and writing. He successively served as a professor at Zhejiang Higher School, Zhejiang Public Law and Politics College, National Southeast University, and Shanghai Zhizhi University. Unfortunately, the sad news came that he passed away in his hometown of Tongli, Wujiang, on October 4 last year. People at home and abroad were saddened to hear the news. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and domestic celebrities Liu Yazi, Hu Pu'an, Zhu Fengwei, Zhu Shaoping, etc., specially initiated a meeting to commemorate Mr. Chen at the Ningbo Township Association at 3:00 PM on March 4. The announcement of the memorial service stated: "We have heard of the Zhang Shao agreement of the white horse and plain carriage before his death, and the Qiao Xuan alliance of a chicken and a jug of wine after his death. The aspirations of attacking jade are sincere, and the friendship of casting gold is close. Chen Qubing came from Songling and was known throughout the world. He joined the Tongmenghui early and reorganized the Nanshe. He was like Lu Zhonglian, who did not serve Qin when surrounded by the city, and like Shen Baoxu, who was determined to restore Chu when he wept blood on the court wall. He has already illuminated the sun and the moon, and his spirit is thin. He served Premier Sun Yat-sen in Yangshi, planning strategies and advising, like Zhang Liang assisting Emperor Gaozu of Han. He relied on his strategy at the military gate, like Deng Yu following Emperor Guangwu of Han. He was always respectful, and was treated with great kindness. Ah, how prosperous he was! When Zhong Zi died, he stopped playing the strings. When Bole died, he grieved over the loss of his good horse. He hid in the forests and springs, and focused on literature and history. The national spirit has been through several years, but it has been troubled by the dragon and snake. He exhausted the treasures of the sea house, and the schools were full of sorrow and scholars wept. Is there no reason for this? We are allied in the Nanshe, and our feelings are stronger than brothers. We are saddened by the death of Chen Zhi, and we dare not be stingy with our offerings. May the pine and cypress trees provide a home for the gods of Mount Tai, and may the lychee and yellow banana trees enjoy the temple of Luo Chi for a long time. Wu Tiecheng, Liu Yazi, Hu Pu'an, Zhu Fengwei, Zhu Shaoping."</p>
<h3>The Office of the Economic Commission Has Moved</h3>
<p>No. 29 West Adams Road</p>
<p>Inside the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The National Economic Commission, in order to facilitate the development of its affairs and contact with all parties, specially leased a building at No. 1729 Avenue Joffre in this city as the Shanghai office of the commission, which has been in operation for several months. It is now learned that the commission has moved the office to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance at No. 29 West Adams Road in order to save expenses due to the large monthly expenses of the building, and is continuing to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Several Foreign Groups Participate in Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>According to a report in the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" yesterday, the movement to reduce rents throughout Shanghai is expanding daily. The participation of various sectors in the Chinese concessions is quite enthusiastic, and all citizens support and endorse it in the hope of achieving their demands. It is estimated that more than ten foreign groups have joined in support, with Japanese, Russians, and Indians being the most numerous. The British, Americans, and other countries are also working hard to encourage the movement for the sake of promoting public welfare and stimulating the prosperity of the market. Currently, all nationalities are working together to actively promote the movement and will not give up until it is implemented. It has been found that in recent years, the price index has gradually declined, but rents have continued to increase. In terms of the standard index of 260 daily necessities and the rent index:</p>
<p>Price Index　Rent Index</p>
<p>1926 ｜｜ 100,　100,</p>
<p>1929 ｜｜ 104,　122,</p>
<p>1930 ｜｜ 111,　104,</p>
<p>1931 ｜｜ 112,　106,</p>
<p>1932 ｜｜ 112,　107,</p>
<p>1933 ｜｜ 103,　109,</p>
<p>1934 ｜｜ 098,　110,</p>
<p>Since 1926, the price index has dropped by 20 percent, while rents have risen by as much as 12 percent. Moreover, the number of households has been increasing year by year, but rents have continued to rise, which is a major problem in society. In 1930, there were 2,792 households, in 1932, there were 4,895 households, and in 1932, there were 9,585 households.</p>
<h3>Anhui Bank Suspends Operations</h3>
<p>The Wuhu Anhui Bank opened in the 15th year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It has a branch in Shanghai. The founder, Zhu Jinhou, owned more than half of the shares. He was elected as a director and general manager. Since its opening, the business has been smooth. From the 15th to the 19th year, the profits were quite substantial, so in addition to issuing official dividends, 130,000 yuan was set aside as a public reserve. In the 20th year, the Yangtze River flood caused the decline of commerce in the provinces along the river, and the bank bore the brunt of it, suffering considerable hidden losses. However, it was still able to maintain its operations with great effort. Last year, the bank's General Manager Zhu planned to expand the Shanghai branch's business in order to develop it. In April, he hired Yin Zibai and Hu Shuren to assist in the bank's operations, adding to the number of bonds issued and expanding its dealings. In August, the Wuhu head office suddenly reported a shortage of silver, and the Shanghai branch tried to make adjustments. Later, Jiu Yu Zhuang in Wuhu also lacked silver, and the Shanghai branch indirectly provided relief. Eventually, the Min Rebellion suddenly broke out and could not be repaid for a long time. At that time, Yin and Hu resigned and recommended Chen Yushun to replace them and continue operations until the end of the year. Recently, it was heard that the Shanghai branch, for its own sake, asked the head office to return the amount owed. Unexpectedly, General Manager Zhu suddenly telegraphed the Shanghai branch on the 18th of this month to suspend operations and wait for the shareholders' meeting to be held on March 5 to decide whether to continue. It has been found that the bank has a traffic and real estate bond agreement of 1 million yuan, various deposits of more than 300,000 yuan, and about 500,000 yuan of loans that are difficult to recover. The loans that can be recovered are about 400,000 yuan. After offsetting the deposits and loans and repaying the various deposits, half of the shareholders' capital can still be paid back. The notice is recorded below: Notice is hereby given that this branch has just received a clever telegram from the Wuhu head office stating that since the bank was opened, it has always been prudent. However, since the flood in the 20th year, the transfer of funds for disaster relief to Han and Xun has been stagnant at more than 400,000 yuan. Last year, the Wuhu rice business was just starting, and the Fujian Incident occurred, blocking the Chaozhou and Shantou roads, causing rice merchants to collapse, and the impact was no less than the previous year. Jinhou's service has been inadequate and he feels deeply guilty. The bank's original capital of more than 500,000 yuan has released a book balance of nearly 1 million yuan, and various deposits are only slightly more than 300,000 yuan. However, the book balance cannot be collected immediately, and the deposits cannot be repaid immediately. Considering that his energy is declining, if he does not plan early, it will damage the interests of the depositors, and he will be even more ashamed at that time. Therefore, he requested the board of directors to resolve to seek a liquidation method after the major conclusion on February 13, and to schedule a meeting of all shareholders on March 5 to decide whether to continue. Before the meeting, the collection and settlement will be temporarily suspended. Jinhou is responsible for ensuring that the depositors do not suffer any loss, only a matter of time, and requests understanding. If depositors indicate the debts of the bank's debtors and both parties agree, the bank can transfer the accounts at any time to reduce the scope. Please check and handle accordingly. It has been found that the Shanghai branch has released a book balance of more than 500,000 yuan and various deposits of 220,000 yuan, which is more than enough to offset the two. Now, according to the telegram from the head office, the collection and payment will be temporarily suspended, pending the decision of the general meeting of shareholders on March 5. This is a reasonable notice, and we hope for public understanding. February 19th, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Two-Roads Council Makes Demands</h3>
<p>Representatives are appointed to petition the Railway Bureau.</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau has responded to each item.</p>
<p>The Council of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Workers' Union, based on the talks of the representatives of the branch offices on February 2, resolved to demand that the Railway Bureau promptly announce the annual salary increase, performance appraisal methods, and other regulations. It specially appointed directors Min Luo-ying, Chen Bohua, Feng Qishu, and others as representatives to petition the Railway Bureau. It is now known that the Railway Bureau has made a reply to each item. The reporter of the New News Agency has specially explored and recorded the situation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Petition</h3>
<p>The association's petition to the Railway Bureau stated, "Petition for petition matters. This association is for the sake of rectifying association affairs, promoting work to develop the railway industry, and advocating equal treatment. Therefore, it convened a meeting of representatives of branch offices on February 2. After the association affairs and other items were discussed, many cases were submitted by the branch offices. As a result of the discussions, it was decided that the association's directors Min Luo-ying, Chen Bohua, Feng Qishu, Wang Weixia, Xue Jie, Cai Jinghai, Yuan Qichang, and other directors will lead all the representatives (a list is attached) to the bureau to petition at 9:00 a.m. today. Please examine and approve them separately, and sincerely reply to each case (the reasons for the cases are attached separately). The matter concerns the welfare of all employees of the two roads. The time for the petition is imminent.</p>
<h3>Nine Demands</h3>
<p>The association has made nine demands to the Railway Bureau, which are recorded as follows: (1) The request for the annual salary increase for employees in the second half of the 22nd year should be promptly announced. (2) The request for the prompt announcement of the annual salary increase and performance appraisal methods, as well as other regulations. (3) The request to negotiate with the Railway Bureau to allow branch offices to send official telegrams. (4) For car service employees who work on national holidays, they should be given one day of substitute leave pay in accordance with the Employee Service Regulations. (5) For low-level workers in the car service, mechanical service, and public works departments, the salary should be increased to the same level as the workers in the materials department. (6) Employees who are promoted should receive a promotion salary increase, which should not affect the annual salary increase. (7) Director Mo Heng of the General Affairs Department has slandered the Party and the country, destroyed the labor movement, and engaged in private fraud. Most of the matters have not been determined. Please provide a solution. (8) It is often difficult for workers to ask for leave of absence from the factory. Compared with the implementation situation of the Wusong Machine Factory, the treatment is very unfair. The old system before August of the 20th year should be restored. (9) Employee family members' free tickets and benefit tickets must be issued locally.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau's Reply</h3>
<p>The original text of the reply from the Two-Roads Administration states, "All submitted documents have been noted. The following are the instructions for each case: (1) The performance appraisal and salary increase case for the second half of the 22nd year is being rushed and will be announced and submitted to the ministry for approval soon. (2) The performance appraisal and salary increase methods are being reviewed and formulated. Before the announcement, all performance appraisal matters are handled in accordance with the regulations of the ministry and the customs of this road that do not conflict with the regulations of the ministry. The ministry's instructions on the performance appraisal and salary increase method have been announced many times and do not need to be announced again. (3) The branch offices of the association may send telegrams if they are necessary for official business, but they must be signed by the stationmaster before they can be sent. It should also be noted that the branch offices of the labor union must not directly publish documents and telegrams to the outside world. (4) On December 8 of the 20th year, this bureau promulgated the regulations for the payment of overtime work salaries in various departments, stipulating that rotating workers shall not receive overtime work or holiday work salaries. Previously, the association forwarded requests from the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Yongshao sections to add holiday work salaries to the car service station team employees. After the car service department's investigation and reply, the employees are all rotating workers and cannot be given salary increases in accordance with the previous regulations. Article 10 of the Employee Service Regulations refers to those who exceed their designated service time, and Article 11 refers to those who are assigned to work overtime during holidays by the主管人员. Those who were originally scheduled to work on holidays and did not exceed the stipulated time shall not cite the above regulations. However, whether the commemorative holidays stipulated by the National Government should be handled in the same way as ordinary holidays should be reported to the ministry for instructions. (5) The expansion of the salary range for workers in the Materials Department was originally because the treatment of workers in that department was lower than that of other departments. The wages of workers in various departments who are below 24 yuan, such as road maintenance crews in the public works department, porters in the car service department, and car wipers in the mechanical service department, either have dormitories, uniforms, or temporary allowances. The treatment is already better, and there are opportunities for promotion and transfer. The original treatment of workers in the Materials Department was meager, and there was no hope for promotion or transfer. Therefore, after detailed consultation with the Party Department and the labor union, they were allowed to expand the salary range to show fairness. Workers in various departments should not request this example again. (6) Employees who have served less than one year after a promotion cannot be evaluated for salary increases, which is clearly stipulated by the ministry. The request conflicts with the ministry's regulations and should not be approved. (7) Please wait for the ministry's instructions to resolve it. (8) The original submission is unclear and has been ordered to be investigated and handled by the mechanical service department. (9) If employees and their families are unable to obtain free train tickets from the railway bureau due to emergencies, the主管首领 of the factory section may issue them locally. This bureau has already issued a circular to all departments to comply with it. The request should not be discussed. Let it be known. This order."</p>

<h3>River Transport Companies in Sichuan Seek to Save Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>丨Cooperation Alliance Agreed Yesterday Afternoon丨</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Freight Rises by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>All Cargo Freight Rates Increased</p>
<p>The route from Shanghai to Chongqing, Sichuan, has always been transferred from Yichang to Chongqing by river boats. Since the opening of direct Shanghai-Chongqing routes by Minsheng, Taikang, Taikoo, Jardine, and other shipping companies in recent years, freight rates have plummeted. The river route in Sichuan, which the shipping industry once regarded as a golden route, was almost like chicken ribs last year. With short freight rates and a lack of cargo, excessive competition has led to a situation where income cannot cover expenditure, resulting in great losses for all companies. Now, in order to save the river transport industry in Sichuan, the shipping companies have decided to abandon the past competition and adopt the principle of alliance and cooperation, so that the companies can unite and raise freight rates. A meeting was held in Shanghai last night to determine the direction of cooperation. This reporter believes that this matter has a great impact on the Yangtze River shipping industry, and has made a special trip to various parties for a thorough investigation, and the general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Low Freight Rates and Losses for Shipping Companies</h3>
<p>The cargo shipped from Shanghai to Sichuan is mainly cotton yarn. In the past, when freight rates were at their highest, each piece of cotton yarn shipped to Chongqing would cost more than 30 taels of silver. This was still the price for transferring via Yichang. In recent years, since the shipping companies added direct Shanghai-Chongqing ships, the ships only cared about loading cargo and did not consider costs. Last year, prices fell repeatedly. In the shortest time, each piece of cotton yarn only cost 8 yuan, and even in the shallow water period, it only cost 12 yuan, which is equivalent to just over 8 taels and 5 qian of silver, which is not enough to cover the cost of each ship's operation. Due to the drop in cotton yarn prices, other goods also fell along with it. Last year, none of the river boats in Sichuan were able to make a profit, and almost all of them suffered losses.</p>
<h3>Agreement to Save Alliance Cooperation</h3>
<p>Currently, there are Taikoo, Jardine, Jiejiang, Sanbei, Minsheng, Guangyao, China Merchants, and other companies operating river boats in Shanghai. At the beginning of this month, British companies such as Taikoo, in view of the constant price reduction and competition of river boats in Sichuan, the result of which would be mutual destruction and unnecessary sacrifices, negotiated with Chinese companies such as Minsheng and Chuanbei to save the river transport industry in Sichuan. The first step was to eliminate competition among companies and realize alliance cooperation. Referring to the precedent of the four companies in the Shanghai-Ningbo route, all river boats would jointly operate, redetermine the freight rates for various goods, abide by the alliance regulations, and not have any private price increases or decreases. The cargo delivery forms of each company must be exchanged and viewed. This measure has been unanimously approved by all companies.</p>
<h3>Open Methods of Yesterday Afternoon's Meeting</h3>
<p>Taikoo, Jardine, Minsheng, Jiejiang, Sanbei, and others each sent representatives to gather at the Jiejiang Company on the Bund at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to publicly discuss the open methods of alliance cooperation for river boats in Sichuan. Guangyao Company was also invited to join. It was heard that the Chinese side had several opinions, such as Gaoxian and Yibu, where British ships have not yet been able to navigate. The goods loaded on Chinese ships in that port should not be included in the cooperation conditions. In addition, the section from Kuizhou to Wushan should be operated by Chinese ships. Mail and other shipments should be carried by each ship and not be included in public distribution. If there are troop transports, Chinese ships should provide the service, but the business during that period should also be distributed publicly. These are the proposals made by the Chinese shipping companies. Otherwise, they can all abide by the agreed methods.</p>
<h3>Increase Freight Rates and Redetermine Transport Rates</h3>
<p>After the cooperative principles of the shipping companies were passed, they continued to discuss the increase in freight rates on the Sichuan River. The current freight rates are not enough to cover costs and losses are worrying. The main cargo transported from Shanghai to Sichuan is cotton yarn, so the cotton yarn freight rate will be used as a target. Currently, the price of each piece of cotton yarn from Shanghai to Chongqing is 12 yuan. Now, it is publicly agreed to increase it by 10 yuan, and the freight rate for each piece is increased to 22 yuan. According to the original rate, it is increased by about 80%. The freight rates for other miscellaneous goods are also increased by 70% to 80% in proportion to the cotton yarn freight rate. The detailed tariff (i.e., freight rate list) for the detailed goods will be discussed and redetermined by the representatives of each company, and then the new prices will be announced and implemented. The representatives unanimously passed the proposal at the time.</p>
<h3>Customs Brokers' Association Also Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>When the Sichuan customs brokers heard this news, they thought that since the river shipping industry in Sichuan had changed its current system, allied and cooperated, and increased freight rates, this move was also closely related to the customs brokers. Therefore, all Sichuan customs brokers were convened by the Customs Brokers' Association yesterday for an emergency meeting at the Customs Brokers' Association to discuss the contact with customers after accepting the new freight rates and new methods of the shipping companies. As for the alliance and cooperation of the shipping companies, after the draft methods are determined and the transport rates are announced, they must be jointly implemented within this month.</p>
<h3>Existing Chinese and Foreign Shipping Companies on the Sichuan River</h3>
<p>Currently, the commercial ships sailing on the Sichuan River from Shanghai to Chongqing include four ships from Jiejiang Company, four ships from Minsheng Company, three ships each from Taikoo and Jardine, two ships from Sanbei Company (Fuhua and Fuyang), and one ship from China Merchants Bureau, which is currently stranded. There are also six ships from Guangyao Company. The above are all direct Shanghai-Chongqing lines. There are also more than ten ships from Jiejiang, Minsheng, Taikoo, Jardine, etc. on the Shanghai-Yichang route.</p>
<h3>Court to Send Forensic Doctor to Examine Li Guojie's Condition</h3>
<p>No News Yet from the Supreme Court's Judgment</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steamship Bureau, was sentenced to three years in prison by the Shanghai District Court for privately borrowing foreign debts and engaging in bribery. Chen Fumu and Wang Yunzhang, who were on the run, were also wanted. Li refused to accept the judgment and appealed. After the High Court summoned him for trial, the sentence was changed to three years and six months. After Li was sent to the court, he was sent to Shanghai Hospital for accommodation because he had a long-term illness and could not be detained for long. The Fuchang Ginseng Bank and lawyer Jiang Yiping reported to the court, which ordered him to be sent to Shanghai Hospital for accommodation, and multiple police officers were sent to take turns to protect him. His life was still comfortable. However, Li again declared that he was dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court, the court of final instance. There has been no news of the judgment to date. The District Court has paid close attention to Li's case, and the reception of guests and the entry and exit of letters are closely monitored. Moreover, Li has been hospitalized for treatment for one year. It is not known whether he has recovered, so it is planned to send a forensic doctor to the hospital to examine him to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers in Tao Changhai Case Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>The Other Bandits Were Given Heavy Sentences</p>
<p>Tao Changhai, a local compradore of the Ellis Foreign Company on North Sichuan Road, returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou on his own car at 11:00 p.m. on December 24th last year. While traveling near North Henan Road and Laobazi Road, he was kidnapped by bandits and hidden in a foreign house at No. 9 Beihai Road. After the case of extortion was reported, it was solved by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the Investigation Division of the General Patrol Room, Detective Liu Shaokui, and Chinese and Western detectives. The hostage Tao Changhai was rescued, and nine men and women, including the kidnappers Fei Xiangqing, Xu Arong, Xu Zhaofu, Zhou Songlin, Zhang Linsheng, and Chen Dequan, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Local Court. It was also found that Xu Arong had colluded with the escaped Wu Zicheng, Tao Yutang, Zhang Xiaobai, Su Zicai, etc., at noon on July 21 of the 19th year of the Republic of China to kidnap Xie Keming, the former compradore of Ellis Foreign Company, near Jiangxi Road and Sijing Road, and hide him at No. 12 Yidingpan Road in the French Concession, and extorted a large sum of money. Later, the family members redeemed the ticket with 15,000 yuan. Fei Xiangqing, Xu Arong, Xu Zhaofu, Zhou Songlin, Lu Jinbao, Tao Yutang, and Chen Guisheng, who were sentenced to death by the Second Special Court, kidnapped Wu Wuxing, the manager of a company, on Baek Road at 8:00 a.m. on February 25th of the year before last and hid him in the house at No. 13 Laodeng Road in the French Concession, and extorted a large sum of money. Later, the family members also redeemed the ticket with 25,000 yuan. The details of the interrogation have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Upon instruction, the discussion was concluded and the sentence was awaited. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui visited the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Fei Xiangqing and Xu Arong to death. Xu Zhaofu and Zhou Songlin were each sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment. Zhang Linsheng was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, and Chen Dequan was sentenced to six years. The number of days of detention before the determination of the judgment shall be offset by one day of imprisonment for every two days. Three pistols, sixty-six bullets, and various exhibits shall be confiscated according to the list. Zhu Kunshan, Fei Zhu's, and Xu Xue's were all found not guilty. The bureau's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, requested that he be detained during the appeal period, and the court approved it.</p>
<h3>More Than 100 Shops on Dayang Bridge in Zhabei Present to Railway Bureau for Exemption from Demolishing Bridge</h3>
<p>To Maintain Business on the Opposite Bank</p>
<p>More than 100 shops such as Hesheng Rice Store and Sauce Garden on Dayang Bridge in Zhabei presented a petition to the two railways yesterday to stop the demolition of the wooden bridge in order to facilitate transportation. The original petition stated, "Petition to preserve the necessary road to maintain the commercial market, and to request that the matter be examined and approved to show compassion for the merchants. Since Dayang Bridge and the Panjiawan area were destroyed in the disaster of January 28, the losses have been almost complete. However, they have been forced to make a living and have worked hard to resume business. Fortunately, there is a wooden bridge that crosses the railway at the east end of Dayang Bridge, which can be used to communicate with the citizens of Panjiawan. About 20,000 people come and go every day, which is beneficial to merchants and convenient for workers. They trade with each other to maintain their livelihoods. Now, a concrete wall is being built along the railway, and there is talk of demolishing the wooden bridge to prevent traffic. If it is implemented, it will be inconvenient for the citizens of both sides to travel, and the commercial and industrial markets will be greatly affected. The disadvantages of factories and the closure of shops are foreseeable. It is inevitable that they will be affected by the disaster. Merchants and people have no way to make a living and no place to rely on. Although it is a small road problem, how can the magnitude of its relationship be overstated? It is hereby jointly petitioned to the bureau to show compassion for the people's difficulties, preserve the necessary road, and maintain the commercial market, which is truly virtuous (omitted below)."</p>
<h3>Many Buddhist Temples and Statues in Sacred Temples Were Burned and Robbed. Fujian Buddhist Association Asks for Relief</h3>
<p>And Entrusts Master Yuan Ying to Come to Shanghai as a Representative to Beg for Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Xinwei Relief Association received a letter from the Fujian Provincial Buddhist Association yesterday, stating that since the rebellion occurred in the province, many Buddhist temples in various places have been burned and robbed, and monks and lay refugees are living in the open air, which is extremely tragic. They entrusted Master Yuan Ying as a representative to beg for relief. The original letter stated, "All gentlemen of the Xinwei Relief Association, with respect. This is to inform you that the Buddhist believers in Fujian Province have suffered countless damages to their property and lives due to the sudden occurrence of military disasters in Fujian Province. The most serious cases include the Xuefeng Chong Sheng Temple in the provincial capital, which was robbed by rebellious soldiers, and the Jile Temple in Gutian, which was destroyed. The temples, dharma objects, and Buddha statues were lost in the amount of tens of thousands of yuan. The Wenhua Temple in Luoyuan was also burned. The Zhong Cui Temple in Yanping was looted, and the monks were looted and the artifacts were scattered. The Qisheng and Bailin Temples in Xiapu were shot and killed by bandits, suffering heavy losses. The vast disasters have occurred and there is no way to appeal. The compatriots who have suffered disasters are also urgently awaiting relief. Our colleagues are weak and think repeatedly. The only thing we can do is to rely on philanthropists at home and abroad to develop great compassion, relieve the immediate crisis, allocate funds to help, and relieve the suffering of all beings. We hereby entrust Master Yuan Ying to sincerely request the gentlemen of your association to consider the severe military disaster in Fujian Province and quickly allocate funds to assist in disaster relief. The monks and lay people will be very grateful. If you would like to give instructions, please hand them over to Master Yuan Ying for collection and remittance to Fujian for distribution. With best wishes for your health and well-being, and hoping for a reply."</p>

<h3>Jiang Minsheng Initiates the Organization of the Northeast Refugee Self-Help Group</h3>
<p>Anyone Who Has Been Introduced and Proven Can Participate</p>
<p>Plans to Set Up a Store and a Snow Shame Soap Factory</p>
<p>Former Northeast Anti-Japanese Army Major General Jiang Minsheng has recently found that shining shoes and selling domestic goods in Shanghai can help himself and others. In order to save the Northeast refugees and develop the production industry, he has formulated a simple charter and organized the Northeast Refugee Life Self-Help Group as the basis for establishing the Northeast Refugee Domestic Goods Store and the East China Snow Shame Soap Factory in the future. The charter is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Charter of the Group</h3>
<p>(1) Name: Northeast Refugee Life Self-Help Group, (2) Purpose: To seek fundamental relief for refugees and anti-Japanese comrades, to cultivate the spirit of self-help, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency, and to achieve recovery.</p>
<h3>Sentencing of Zhou Zhanyuan, Manager of the New-New Company, to Life Imprisonment for Shooting</h3>
<p>Zhou's Wife and Two Sons Kneel, Begging for the Release of Funds Owed by New-New</p>
<p>Zhou Zhanyuan, a Tianjin native and the head watchman for the New-New Company, shot and killed Li Minzhou, the company's general manager, in room 327 of the New-New Hotel on the 1st of this month after Li repeatedly refused Zhou's requests to resign. Detectives Huang Yingjie and Liu Xianglun of the police arrested Zhou. Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, prosecuted him under Article 284 of the criminal law for premeditated murder. The First Special Court has concluded its interrogation, and yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division presided over the First Criminal Court and pronounced the verdict: Zhou Zhanyuan is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, and the pistol is confiscated. After the verdict, Zhou's wife and two children knelt before the court, stating that the funds Zhou was owed by the New-New Company had not been paid, despite repeated requests. Even when the court previously instructed Lawyer Wei to retrieve the funds, they were not obtained. They pleaded for relief. The court stated that the funds owed by New-New should rightfully be paid and ordered Lawyer Wei to retrieve them again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the New-New Company sent a letter stating, "Our company's former general manager, Mr. Li Minzhou, died in the line of duty, and your newspaper has reported on this matter repeatedly. However, regarding the repeated requests by the perpetrator Zhou Zhanyuan in court to be paid his salary, we must make a careful clarification. After investigation, the perpetrator has already received and signed for all salary due to him. What he is now demanding is the wooden box bonus. This bonus does not belong to the company; it is public funds accumulated by all employed shareholders and distributed to employees who have been dedicated in their duties at the end of each year as an incentive. Since the perpetrator expressed his demand for the bonus, our company's management has received a signed letter from all employed shareholders, stating that they vow never to give the bonus to such a heinous murderer. Therefore, our company cannot grant the payment. We hope your newspaper will report the truth accurately. New-New Co., Ltd. respectfully."</p>

<h3>Letter Requesting Introduction</h3>
<p>Respectfully, We are deeply grateful for all the help we received from you in the past. Now, with the assistance of Mr. Wu Zhongshan of the Dahua Pencil Factory, Mr. Mao Yi of the Huadong Chemical Factory, Mr. Lu Buzhou of the Wenhua Art &amp; Book Company, and Mr. Zhu Naiwu of the Shanghai Instrument Company, we are selling various domestic goods and anti-Japanese books and paintings, and our livelihood is now self-sufficient. Since we left your association last month, we have received much assistance from compatriots in Shanghai, and our sales have been very good. Besides our living expenses, we have a surplus of several dozen yuan. We are now specially donating 20 yuan to your association to help our compatriots. Furthermore, when Mr. Wang Huayi of the Beiping Northeast Middle School came to Shanghai recently, he witnessed the suffering of the Northeast youths working here who are deprived of education. He has asked General Zhu (Qinglan) to help Zhao Peirong and seven others go to Beiping to study. General Zhu has also asked your association to issue ship tickets. Now we have received four ship tickets, and Mr. Wang Huayi has given us 30 yuan for travel expenses to send them to Beiping to study. We believe that your association has shown great kindness to our refugees by providing both relief and education, and we are deeply grateful and will surely repay you one day. In the future, if any of our Northeast compatriots come to your association requesting relief, please introduce them to participate in our productive work, implement the fundamental way to survive, and strive to recover lost territories. We hope to receive your guidance on all matters in the future. Respectfully submitted to the United Association for Relief of Northeast Refugees.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Ball Features Chinese Costume Performance Filmed</h3>
<p>At the Ye Family Garden in Jiangwan</p>
<p>Produced by Fox Film Corporation</p>
<p>The children's welfare ball held at the Paramount by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association featured a performance of Chinese costumes, from ancient to modern styles, which not only had historical value but also artistic expression.

It is reported that this film will be printed in more than 200 copies within six weeks to be distributed around the world.</p>
<h3>Controversy Over the Natural Science Textbook Published by Datong Bookstore</h3>
<p>In the "Sending a Telegram to Beiping" lesson on page 41 of the seventh volume of the New Life Natural Science Textbook published by the Datong Bookstore in Shanghai, it states that a telegram from Shanghai to Beiping must pass through several telegraph offices in Nanjing, Tianjin, and others, and it usually takes one or two days to arrive. The editor lacks knowledge of telecommunications and is completely inconsistent with the facts, arousing public anger among telegraph office personnel across the country. They have successively petitioned the Ministry of Communications to request the Ministry of Education to order corrections. At the same time, they have also requested the National Telegraph Workers' Welfare Association to engage a lawyer to negotiate with the Datong Bookstore. The Datong Bookstore replied to the Ministry of Communications and the lawyer that it had complied with the Ministry's order to make corrections, and all existing books have been revised, and the original version has long been discontinued. However, in reality, the bookstore is still selling the original version in stock. The Telegraph Workers' Welfare Association recently purchased the book from the bookstore multiple times, and it was always the original version and had not been replaced. The association, fearing that the bookstore would deny it, sent staff to the Datong Bookstore on Fuzhou Road on the 10th of this month to purchase four copies, which were still the old version. The association believed that the Datong Bookstore was deliberately deceiving and making malicious publicity, so they immediately asked the Chinese police to certify it and reported it to the police station. At the same time, they also asked a third party, Mr. Xu, to be present to certify that the more than 50 textbooks stored in the cabinet were all original versions, in order to prevent denial. It is reported that the association has reported the matter to the Ministry of Communications and requested the lawyer to negotiate with the Datong Bookstore again.</p>
<h3>Another Voice for Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Organization of a Rent Reduction Branch in Sanduo Lane</p>
<p>The houses in Sanduo Lane, Daji Road, Nanshi, are managed by Liyi Real Estate Company. On the 31st of last month, the tenants of the lane stated that Daji Road is not a prosperous area, and the houses are not spacious or well-built, but the rent for each house is 32 yuan per month. Adding water, electricity, and housing taxes, the monthly burden is more than 40 yuan, which is truly unbearable. Moreover, the houses in the area were hastily constructed due to careless construction, and the walls are damp, and water drips down, damaging clothing. Electricity and running water were delayed for many days before being installed. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the company requesting a fair rent reduction and a delay in the rent start date by half a month. Nearly two weeks have passed, but the company has not responded. The tenants held an ad hoc meeting on the 16th, with 38 households participating. Zhang Longhai was elected chairman, and Fang Weiren from the Municipal Party Department attended and gave guidance. It was immediately resolved to organize the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, Daji Road Sanduo Lane Branch, in the Hunan District of Shanghai. Zhang Longhai, Tang Shuming, Qian Yichai, Shen Xiaochu, and Li Qilin were elected as committee members to join the general association and strive to carry out the rent reduction movement until the goal is achieved. It was also stipulated that the monthly rent amount should be deposited in the Ximen Branch of the Shanghai Bank and paid after the landlord's satisfactory response. The association also invited lawyers Mei Hezhang, Wang Chengkuan, and Huang Daping as legal advisors.</p>

<h3>Wen Zongyao is Innocent</h3>
<p>A Dispute Over Concubinage Comes to an End</p>
<p>Wen Zongyao, who was appointed as a president during the era of the seven presidents of the Southwest Military Government, still entered the world of romance in his old age. Two years ago, he took the prostitute Shouzhen (i.e., Jin Yuan) as his concubine and used the three-story attic at 584 Tiantong Road as her golden house. Unexpectedly, Jin Yuan was willing to be a fallen flower without an owner. She recently used the excuse of going to the hospital to give birth and fled without Wen's knowledge. While Wen was reporting the case to the police for investigation, a widow from Hangzhou, Yu Wang, claimed to be Jin Yuan's mother and accused Wen of kidnapping at the First Special District Court. The trial has concluded, and the announcement of the verdict was pending, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict in the case. The defendant Wen Zongyao still went to the court with his lawyer, but the plaintiff did not appear in court. Judge Wu Zehan then took the seat in the Second Court and announced the verdict. The main text stated that the defendant Wen Zongyao was not guilty. The counter-suit filed by Wen against Yu Wang for false accusation was also dismissed at the same time.</p>

<h3>Blind Elder Brother Sues Younger Brother for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Zhu Binzhang, the owner of the Mingfeng Organ Factory at 1 Ciji Lane, Gonghexin Road, Zhabei, is from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. In 1931, because his elder brother Zhu Linzhang repeatedly pestered him, he sued in the local court, requesting to sever the brotherly relationship. The court advised Zhu Binzhang to provide Zhu Linzhang, who was blind and unable to support himself, with 20 yuan per month for living expenses. Zhu Binzhang listened to the advice and, out of brotherly affection, agreed to do so. However, Zhu Linzhang demanded 10,000 yuan for living expenses, which led to litigation that has lasted for more than two years and remains unresolved. Recently, Zhu Linzhang hired a lawyer to publish a statement, claiming that the Mingfeng Organ Factory was established with the joint investment of him and his younger brother Zhu Binzhang, and filed a lawsuit with the procuratorate of the local court, accusing his younger brother Zhu Binzhang of abandoning him. Zhu Binzhang also published a rebuttal in the newspaper and submitted a statement to the court, stating that Binzhang's father died when he was three years old, and because there was no inheritance, he was raised by his maternal grandparents. Before he reached adulthood, he came to Shanghai to work and became a craftsman in the Science Instrument Museum. Later, he and his friends Wang Rongchu and Lin Zhangfu jointly established the Mingfeng Organ Factory in 1915. Zhu Linzhang did not invest any money in it. At that time, Linzhang also independently established the Zhu Yongtai Woodworking Business, and they each lived separately with independent economies. In 1918, Wang Rongchu and Lin Zhangfu were unwilling to continue the business and handed it over to Binzhang to operate solely. When their father passed away, he left behind more than one mu of paddy fields and two and a half tiled houses, which have not been divided, and Binzhang has not occupied them. In 1931, there was a lawsuit in your court. At that time, Linzhang proposed to divide the organ factory. Binzhang refused because Zhu Linzhang had no investment in the factory. The judge repeatedly advised him to give him 20 yuan per month for living expenses, but he was dissatisfied, and there was no result. There was no intention to abandon, nor was there any act of abandonment, so he should not be held criminally responsible for abandonment. The day before yesterday, Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu ordered both parties to appear in court. As a result of the interrogation, they were instructed to reconcile out of court. It is said that there is no possibility of reconciliation in this case. Yesterday, the judge issued another order for both parties to appear in court, scheduled to continue the interrogation and decision today.</p>
<h3>Training Sea Lions at Bansong Garden</h3>
<p>Starting from the 14th of this month (the first day of the abolished lunar new year), Mr. and Mrs. Dai Gejun, sea lion performance experts from the Shanghai-Haijingbo Circus Troupe, are training sea lions in the Four Sides Hall of the Garden. The various strange shapes and actions are very interesting. However, the sea lions are naturally fierce and difficult to train. Fortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Dai Gejun have worked hard to train them, and the sea lions can now perform a variety of tricks, such as rolling a ball on their noses and other skills. Therefore, there have been many tourists in the garden in recent days, marveling at the sight. We hope that people do not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>De'an Steamer Capsizes Manure Boat</h3>
<p>Four-Year-Old Child Drowned</p>
<p>Tang Lishan, a manure boat owner from Yancheng, recently loaded fertilizer worth 30 yuan from the Suzhou River and sailed eastward along the Pudong side. When he arrived outside the Hongsheng Wharf near the Liyi Ferry, the Taikoo Steamship Company's De'an steamer was raising anchor to exit and was turning around in that location. The vessels were unable to avoid each other in time, and the De'an steamer struck the manure boat violently in the middle of its port side. The manure boat was immediately overturned, and filth flowed everywhere, with a stench filling the air. There were Tang and his wife, one older child, and five younger children on board, who all fell into the river. After the accident, nearby boats rushed to the rescue, and seven people were rescued. However, Tang's four-year-old son, named Xiao Liuzi, was originally tied with a rope around his waist to prevent him from falling into the river. When the boat capsized, Xiao Liuzi fell into the water and the rope came loose, and he sank and disappeared, tragically drowning. The capsized boat floated with the tide to the surface of Zhangjiabang Creek on the south side, where it was recovered by others. Afterward, the Chinese police of the Maritime Customs Water Police Station took the rescued seven people to the police station. However, Tang's two-year-old daughter, Sheng Nü, became unconscious due to drinking too much water, and Tang himself was stabbed in the lower left ear by a boat hook during the rescue. Therefore, the police sent the two to Renji Hospital. Fortunately, Tang's daughter gradually recovered, and Tang's injuries were not serious. Yesterday, the father and daughter were discharged from the hospital. The police have instructed Tang to submit a petition to the Maritime Customs Port Authority, requesting that the Taikoo Company compensate for the loss of the boat and cargo and provide compensation for the victim.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangrong Goes to Changyuan to Inspect River Works</h3>
<p>Urges Employees to Cut Off Flow Before Peach Bloom Season</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, a member of the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, also serves as the director of the Labor Relief Group. With the Yellow River thawing and ice floods arriving, the safety of the Changyuan Shijiazhuang breach plugging project is of paramount importance. Furthermore, with the abolition of the lunar new year, old habits persist in the inland areas, and he is concerned that workers may neglect their duties, failing to step up the defense. Therefore, he personally went to inspect and guide the work.

<h3>Railway Department Stipulates Fees for Ferrying Mail Cars Across the River</h3>
<p>Instructs Railway Bureau to Comply Yesterday</p>
<p>The Two-Way Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that the Jinpu Railway stated that the Union Transport Office stated that the mail cars attached to the trains are calculated according to volume, at a rate of one cent per cubic meter per kilometer. Regarding the Shanghai-Beiping trains 1201 and 1202, after direct access to the capital ferry, all such mail cars should take Tianjin East Station to Nanjing as the starting and ending points. The Ministry had previously stipulated that the capital ferry distance across the river was ten kilometers. It is requested that the office be consulted as to whether the mail cars should calculate an additional ten kilometers for the capital ferry between Tianjin East Station and Pukou. In response, the Ministry has now stipulated that the fee for mail cars passing through the capital ferry across the river should be determined with reference to the provisions of Article 114 of the Union Transport Regulations for public parcels, at half the rate of ordinary parcel freight. After deducting half, the fee for mail cars passing through the river shall be based on the actual volume given to each mail car. The ordinary parcel passing fee is determined by Order No. 6853 of the Industry Department, collecting three cents per kilogram. The half fee for mail cars passing through the river should be one and a half cents per kilogram. The method of converting cubic meters to kilograms should be based on the provisions of Article 26 of the Freight Car Regulations, converting three cubic meters to one metric ton and one metric ton to one thousand kilograms, collecting one and a half cents per kilogram passing fee. For clarity, a calculation formula for calculating the mail car crossing fee is attached, and it is required to comply and handle the matter. The bureau has instructed the Transportation Department to comply.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Demands Extradition of Jin Shuishan</h3>
<p>Garrison Command Justifiably Refuses</p>
<p>Guomin News stated that after the assassination of Liu Yinfa, a Korean-American, last year, Jin Shuishan, a Cantonese, was identified by the Japanese consulate as being related to the Liu case and reported to the director of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, who arrested Jin. However, after Jin was arrested, various investigations revealed no evidence of involvement in the Liu case. Furthermore, Jin is an active-duty Chinese soldier who fought in the January 28 Incident. Therefore, the Japanese consulate has repeatedly demanded extradition, but the garrison command has justifiably refused. Recently, the Japanese consulate suddenly had an old woman falsely claim to be Jin's mother to prove that Jin was of Korean nationality. However, Jin's parents are both deceased, and he only has an uncle living in Guangdong. This action is clearly fabricated. Jin Shuishan has specially requested the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers Association, the Reporters Association, and other groups to uphold justice and safeguard our national sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Yong'an Hall Prosecutes a Counterfeit Wanjinyou Case in Tainan</h3>
<p>The Tiger Balm Wanjinyou created by Yong'an Hall has effective medicinal properties and sells extremely well. As a result, a group of unscrupulous merchants and profiteers, disregarding human well-being, spare no effort to use counterfeit and imitative tricks.

It has just been learned that Lu Jueshen, the special investigator of the hall in Taiwan, sent a report yesterday on the seizure of counterfeit medicine, stating that at the beginning of this month, he learned that counterfeit Tiger Balm Wanjinyou was being sold in Tainan. He immediately tried to buy it and requested the Tainan authorities to handle the case fairly. The governor of the prefecture personally led him to the head of the health department's home, then to the director's office of the judicial affairs, presenting a dozen fake Wanjinyou and nine purchase orders for review. On the 9th of this month, they carefully investigated the printing of the fake medicine and the manufacturing location of the empty bottles. They went to the addresses of the three parties and the name of the counterfeiter, who turned out to be Chen Youcai, located at 49 Yongle Town 3-chome, Tainan. They reported to the police station, informing them of the address of the counterfeiter. At 4 pm, judicial director Wu Tianjiri led several bailiffs to surround Chen Youcai's residence. Chen was caught off guard and 50 cans of counterfeit Wanjinyou and correspondence were found. Chen Youcai was immediately detained. Later, the judicial director searched Chen Youcai's house again and found a large amount of counterfeit medicine materials, which are currently being investigated. After more arrests are made, they will be jointly prosecuted and punished according to the law.</p>

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this area was 45.9 degrees, and the lowest was 34.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 46.8 degrees and the lowest was 32.4 degrees.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Recently, news reports have stated that the Xu Yuying Case Support Association held a meeting to discuss methods of support for the case of Ji Juemi seducing the young girl Xu Yuying, and that the Shanghai Bar Association participated, etc. This is not true. After investigation, this association neither sent personnel to participate in this case beforehand, nor heard anything about it afterwards. We are deeply concerned that someone may be using our name to swagger and deceive people, and it is necessary to make a statement. Therefore, we are sending this letter, hoping that your newspaper will pay attention. We would be especially grateful if you could publish it in the Letters to the Editor column. Sincerely, Standing Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association, February 19th.</p>

<h3>Reading Guidance:</h3>
<p>"What kind of talent is needed in today's society?" Perhaps no one can give a concrete answer to this question? In this flood of unemployment, it can be said that there is a surplus of all kinds of talent, and none is needed. But when we think of the underdevelopment of China's industries, and when we think of the day when we will talk about construction, we will feel that there is not enough of any kind of talent, and all are needed. We are indeed trapped in this contradiction now. This is probably an inevitable phenomenon in China during this transition period!</p>
<p>In "Reading Q&amp;A," we have repeatedly pointed out that an individual's "path" should be compatible with society's "path," otherwise you will only have illusions and disappointments, and you will not achieve a true "path." To study for the sake of a "path" is naturally the most correct method. But you must never only look at yourself with his eyes, regardless of society. You say: "I read to survive." If the "survival" you speak of means coexisting and prospering with society, this is correct; if it is only for the temporary selfish survival of one person, then "reading" is not only meaningless, but also unable to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Since the purpose of reading cannot be limited to one's own personal selfishness, the choice of learning paths should not be limited to one's own preferences. At the very least, personal interests can only be placed in a secondary position and cannot but be given special attention.</p>
<p>There is a big contradiction in your letter. On the one hand, you sing the praises of "reading to increase survival skills," but what have you chosen? It is "poetry," which cannot be used to make a living, and it is the literary antique of China's past. According to you, it is to "express the feelings in your heart," this purpose has obviously changed.</p>
<p>We do not oppose readers freely choosing subjects to study. We originally only stood on the sidelines and offered some guidance and advice. If you want to study literature, although we cannot guarantee that you will not be disappointed, since your purpose is "to increase survival skills," this is indeed a path. According to the needs of society, it cannot be said that a certain era can do without literature. However, what you have chosen is the antique of the past, the "elegant" profession that only those with ample time and affluent lives can engage in. Now there are only a few "old relics" and "young masters" left who use this kind of style to "express the feelings in their hearts."</p>
<p>Needless to say, this choice is harmful to people like you.</p>
<p>Probably because you "stay at home all day and are very alienated from everything in society!" You are indeed too vague about real life. We feel that people living in an environment like yours should read more books to understand real society. Even if you read literature, you should naturally read modern works, and you should not go back to chewing on antiques. Vernacular poetry has long been harvested in China, and there are many famous works worth reading. Vernacular expression is also freer than classical Chinese, the dead sounds have long been liberated, now natural sounds are used, modern sounds are used, and there is no need for "poetry rhymes" and other rubbish.</p>
<p>Therefore, from our assessment of you, it is okay for you to study some poetry in your spare time, but please study vernacular poetry first. At the same time, we also hope that you do not forget reality. You must know that the people who will be able to survive in the future society must be people with new knowledge, correct understanding, organized minds, able to adapt to group life, and have the perseverance to never give up.</p>

<h3>The Solitary Garden</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>Mencius said that solitary enjoyment is not as good as shared enjoyment. This is the most high-sounding statement. Therefore, those autocratic tyrants who cover up their peaceful facade must display the banner of "sharing joy with the people" so that the common people will obediently swallow their tears and shout "Long live the emperor!"</p>
<p>But Sima was dishonest and impolite, naming his villa "Solitary Garden." Mr. Tai once scolded him at a certain lecture, saying that he was far inferior to Fan Zhongyan, who was concerned about the world's troubles before anyone else and rejoiced only after everyone else had enjoyed happiness. This is still taking the words literally and is somewhat forced. Who knew that Chen Shuixiang's public reputation was not as good as his gardener Lu Zhi.</p>
<p>Chen Yengao of the Yuan Dynasty wrote in the Beixuan Notes: "Sima Gong set up the Solitary Garden. In the bright spring, the plants and trees were luxuriant and beautiful. Those who watched all gave money to the gardener Lu Zhi, calling it tea money. He accumulated ten thousand coins and presented them to Gong, but Gong refused, saying, 'Do I lack this?' Zhi said, 'Is it only Duanming in the world who does not love money?' Thereupon, he used all the money to build a parallel pavilion to benefit passersby." Yengao also praised the master and servant, saying: "With only one 'does not love money,' he can be compared to Duanming, and can also awaken Duanming. It is impossible for anyone other than Duanming to have this servant. Unexpectedly, in addition to the talented Junshi, there is such a person." In fact, Duanming had two mistakes: one was that he should not have allowed the gardener to accept money, and the other was that he should not have said that he did not lack it. Fortunately, Lu Zhi was a kind person, not allowing his master to be good alone, but exceeding his master by one step, doing a career of sharing joy with others, and Duanming could not help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Originally, "When the prime minister is from Hefei, the world becomes thin; when the agricultural minister is from Changshu, the world becomes barren" has become a common saying. Chen Shuixiang's solitary garden naturally could not escape this common saying. However, he still made some achievements in politics. Although the world became thin, there was still some rice to eat. Although the world became barren, there was still some rice to harvest. Like the current public figures, villas face each other, not allowing idlers, but rather allowing the cobwebs to be sealed. To this day, there are still rubble and debris on the Songhu Road. At that time, I don't know where the displaced refugees went. I heard someone say that last year a certain public figure wanted to send a house to a certain general, but the general said, "Please move this money to build affordable housing for civilians in the capital." This is the poetic idea of Du Fu's "Ten thousand mansions to shelter the poor scholars," but unfortunately these words are most likely to spoil people's fun.</p>
<p>I criticize Chen Shuixiang's public reputation and feel that it is too harsh and unavoidable to blame. Because he still did not want everyone to swallow their tears and shout "Long live the emperor!" There are many public figures in the world who enjoy happiness before anyone else and worry only after everyone else has suffered.</p>
<h3>Tavern</h3>
<p>— Ying Jun</p>
<p>The northwest wind blew down from the tall western-style buildings on both sides, and my ears seemed to be detaching from my body. Nanjing Road at night, under the rule of the god of winter, was not as lively as in summer. In a dark tavern in the stadium, we skillfully stepped over the threshold.</p>
<p>There was no stove, and the cold still dominated the space. Looking out the glass window on the top floor, the winter sale banners fluttered!</p>
<p>Clams, dried duck gizzards, smoked fish from the old Dafang store. And those wisps of hot air, rising up with blue fish tails and creamed cabbage hearts. These days we have been living in a state of drunkenness. On this night with the northwest wind blowing, I responded to a friend's appointment and still in a distant place, ran over here.</p>
<p>The moment of drunkenness allows us to escape from the cage of worries. After abstaining from alcohol for a year, I am spending my life in a drunken state every day in these nights when my mood is not calm. We are not participating in a grand banquet here, but in a tavern that every petty bourgeois shares. The form of every drunkard squatting at the table is truly exposed. There is no false humility, no symphony of arrogant money. This is where we vent the daily complaints that have been suppressed. The harsh winter of rain and snow has arrived, and the second new year is also passing in a hurry, arriving at the earth struck by the cold wind. When we were children, we always hoped for Lantern Festivals every night. At this time, there were no wounds of life, no sufferings of life. In a lonely foreign land, I thought of my home thousands of miles away, and they were already busy preparing for the New Year. "Wine enters the sorrowful intestines and turns into tears of longing." After drinking, the brain nerves are often filled with some future troubles: this is the so-called "borrowing wine to dispel sorrow only increases sorrow." What's more, for a year, I have been living in a fighting environment.</p>
<p>Plates and wine pots piled up in the corner of the table; my face felt hot. Clam shells and blue fish bones were piled up like small hills in front of everyone. The temperature in the room was also warmer than when I wasn't drunk. Odes to the joys and sorrows of life, we staggered out of the tavern door.</p>
<p>The northwest wind blew down from the tall western-style buildings on both sides, and my ears seemed to be detaching from my body. Nanjing Road at night, under the rule of the god of winter, was not as lively as in summer.</p>
<h3>Calendar Posters</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>"Calendar posters are a boon to rural women, they are the most welcome. If it is a newlywed, the four walls of the new house must be covered with 'calendar posters.'" Or at the end of the abandoned lunar year, after sweeping the dust off the furniture in the room, some new "calendar posters" are also hung up.</p>
<p>However, some "calendar posters" are indeed printed very gorgeously, and the women are also beautiful. The products of cigarette companies are the most fashionable. Rural women can only pursue the modern girls in the city on "calendar posters." To make fashionable clothes, they also have to learn the style from "calendar posters." But the "calendar posters" that are popular now do not have the months printed on them. They only print a beautiful woman and their own brand name, which is meaningless. On the contrary, they gradually make frugal women tend to be extravagant. Rather than hanging a meaningless picture, it is better to hang a few war pictures of the "September 18th" or "January 28th" Sino-Japanese War, which can also make the general farmers and rural women aware of China's peril, being bullied by others, and cultivate their patriotic psychology! This kind of hanging picture is much more conscious than calendar posters.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Sharing Wine and Food in Boisterous Farewell, Burning the Midnight Oil to Relive Dreams, Singing of Longing</p>
<p>Gui Zhi said, "As for me, you don't need to comfort me. It's just Grandpa and my mother, you should talk to them, say a few words of comfort. "Zi Qiang said, "Our grandpa is fine, but you definitely need to comfort your mother. Don't sleep, wait for me, I'll come back." Gui Zhi laughed, "I've even prepared food for you, how could I sleep first?" Reminded by his wife, Zi Qiang couldn't wait for even a moment. He immediately got up and went to the front yard. Today, Mother Yue's attitude had also changed. Seeing her son-in-law, she was full of affection. This made Zi Qiang feel guilty and he couldn't help but continue talking to her. After talking to her, he went to his father's room to talk. When he returned to the newlyweds' room, it was already past twelve o'clock. He saw four small dishes placed there, and Gui Zhi was sitting on a low stool, with her hands pressed on her knees, as if waiting for something. Seeing Zi Qiang, she immediately stepped forward and took his hand, saying, "You've been talking all night, I'm afraid you're hungry, so I prepared a few dishes and noodles for you to eat." Zi Qiang laughed, "Actually, it would be fine if we just sat and chatted for a while, why bother to go to so much trouble?" Gui Zhi smiled, "Judging from today's situation, you are a guest. As the hostess, isn't it my duty to entertain guests?" Zi Qiang laughed, "That's where you're wrong. As the hostess, you should naturally entertain guests, but where is the host?" Gui Zhi pulled him to sit on the stool, lifted the door curtain, peeked outside, then closed the door, opened the cupboard, took out a small bottle of wine, waved it in front of Zi Qiang in the lamplight, and laughed, "Let me secretly have three cups with you." Zi Qiang was barely sober from the alcohol he had already consumed. He didn't want to drink. But since his wife had said so, he couldn't refuse, so he laughed, "What if I get drunk?" Gui Zhi shook the wine bottle a few times and said, "Look at this, it's only four ounces of wine. You have two ounces, I have two ounces. Four ounces of wine, how could it possibly make two people drunk? Let's drink secretly, no one will know." (316)</p>
<h3>Winter Protection of Goldfish by Tan Wu Jiren</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In winter, all animals love warmth, and goldfish are no exception. When cold water freezes, goldfish often freeze to death. However, frozen fish are not necessarily stiff. Try placing frozen fish in warm water and gently heating them with a fire. As the water warms, the fish can gradually revive. Quickly change to well water (freshly drawn) and place them in a separate container in an indoor room. Move them to strong sunlight. When winter ends, place them back in the tank and they will be fine.</p>
<p>In winter, old fish easily turn sideways and lie in the tank. The cause of the illness is no more than two: (1) The tail is injured, with obvious bloodstains, like disharmony of human limbs and meridians, preventing movement; (2) The fish is heavily pregnant with eggs, the belly as big as a drum, causing it to tilt to one side and making it unable to return to its original state when swimming. Therefore, it lies flat with its belly exposed, but it can still eat and excrete, and will be fine in spring.</p>
<p>When adding mud to a yellow sand tank, fill it halfway. In severe cold, hard ice still forms. To prevent problems before they happen, just cover the tank surface with a straw mat every night, and remove it when the sun rises, so that it receives full sunlight. Or, if heavy clouds descend, it is not necessary to remove the straw mat. However, when placing the straw mat on the tank surface, it is best to leave a few inches of space, because even though the climate is cold, the air should still be ventilated.</p>
<p>Brother Yunshu arranged for Wu Yuan to meet Mr. Xu Weishi at a tea gathering. Mr. Weishi told of a method for treating goldfish with white spots and lumps, saying that it had been tried repeatedly without fail. When the problem first arises, quickly take the sick fish out of the tank, take a large inkstone, and use aged ink juice (the ink must be aged, the foreign ink sold in the market these days is of inferior quality, not only ineffective, but also can hasten the death of the fish), drip it into a bowl (the bowl must not have oil). Let the fish bathe in the ink juice for a short time, then take it out and clean it with clear water, and the mold disease can be completely removed, with no problem at all. That is what Weishi said. I have not yet tried it, but he has been raising fish for decades and must not be mistaken. Why don't fellow enthusiasts try it? Previously, I treated moldy fish by shining a strong electric light on them for half a day. The white spots on the fish's body could turn red, and the mold disease could also be eliminated immediately. However, if the electric light shines too hot, the water should also be added or changed. When treating fish, we must be careful in our work. However, compared to Mr. Xu's method, the difficulty is vastly different. Someone might ask, "In Shanghai, where land is worth an ounce of gold, there is definitely no opportunity to raise fish." I say, "That's not true." Mr. Xue Shouling, the manager of Guanshengyuan on the main road, lives in the bustling city, renting a whole building. In the spring, he raised two two-inch-long "dragon egg" goldfish in a foot-wide porcelain basin. During the day, he moved them to sunlight, and in the evening, he left them alone. The fishmonger provided water fleas on a daily basis, and the water was not changed very often, only when it became unbearably dirty. Over the past year, the fish have become fat and large, with bulging bellies. It is expected that they will lay eggs next spring. This refutes the saying that Shanghai people are not suitable for raising fish.</p>

<h3>Travel Notes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chuan Yizhi</p>
<p>If I could have bought a ticket to Lanxi at the riverbank, then I could have spent the night peacefully at an inn in Lanxi, and by noon the next day, the Quzhou-Lanxi bus could have taken me to Qu County. If I could catch the connecting bus, then from Qu County, to Changshan, to Yushan, I could have reached Shangrao on the same day. The Jinhua-Lanxi line is a branch line of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, opened earlier and with more frequent schedules. Only because I believed someone's words, I had to wait overnight in Jinhua for the train, all the way until noon the next day. This shows how unreliable the trains on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway are.</p>
<p>In Jinhua, there were no singing girls who squeezed out Peking Opera tunes from their diaphragms, and an old woman, a woman in her fifties, gave us special treatment, inviting my three companions and me to drink tea in the back room of her shop. Inside were three old reclining chairs, next to a large rectangular rice cabinet. Her two young children used the cabinet as their bed, sleeping soundly. Near the door was a coal stove. The old woman, wearing a blue cloth headscarf, added firewood to the stove to boil water. When the water was hot, she first filled the three teacups on a broken square table in front of our reclining chairs, then carried the lead kettle outside to the front shop to refill it. After refilling it, she brought it back in to add water and put it back on the stove to boil. She worked tirelessly like this day and night. Sometimes, she would feel tired and sit by the door to doze off. Her eldest son (I guessed) was a rickshaw puller, because I saw him in the room where we were sitting, tying his long gown tightly with a belt, taking a copper bell, and going out the door to pull his rickshaw. I asked him why he worked so hard day and night to solicit business, and he replied, "To eat." I deeply felt how difficult it was to make a living.</p>
<p>What I found most unforgettable was that she took out one of the thin quilts that her children were using to cover their feet for the three of us, fearing that we would catch a cold lying on the reclining chairs. This kind of Buddhist-like kindness would make any traveler grateful to the point of prostration. However, is it possible to find more such people in this modern society that takes pleasure in destroying lives, which can only occasionally be found among the poor elders in the countryside? But here, the doors were broken and the walls were cracked, and the cold wind took advantage of the gaps to enter, ultimately preventing us from closing our eyes for a nap, and we could not help but fail to live up to her kindness.</p>
<p>Jinhua to Yushan could have been reached on the same day, but because the railway had only recently opened, the route was very unstable, and the train traveled extremely slowly. After crossing Quzhou, the earth was already shrouded in dusk. A soldier on the same train was also going to Yushan. Because Yushan was close to bandit territory, security was extremely tight at night. After twelve o'clock, the pontoon bridge from the station to the street would be raised, and no one was allowed to pass. He did not have the "symbol" (identification), and had already gotten off in Quzhou. There were no hotels near the Yushan station. When the train arrived at Jiangshan, it was already nine o'clock in the evening. In order to avoid sleeping in the open, I also got off at Jiangshan, preparing to take the bus to Guangfeng the next day.</p>
<p>Guangfeng is a tobacco-producing area. Every year, hundreds of "water merchants" buy tobacco leaves and transport them to Shanghai for sale. Now, it is said that this place is also bandit territory. How is the tobacco business? I don't know. The bus speed is three or four times faster than the train on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. In less than two hours, it took me to Guangfeng. Although Guangfeng is also bandit territory, the military checks were not strict. I, who did not have a "good citizen certificate" (stamped by the district chief and the fort chief to prove that I was a good citizen, each costing ten or six copper coins), actually entered and left the city in a grand and aboveboard manner. Shangrao was even more troublesome.</p>
<p>I had been away from home for a long time. When I returned home, relatives and friends told me one by one about the "enlightened" rule of the Living阎王 (阎王, a local official's nickname), the "humorous" scolding of people, how the district chief was incorruptible and devoted to public service, the "interesting" beatings when villagers were assigned to build roads, the urgent business of land tax donations, and the conscription of young men. Agencies such as the salt monopoly and the fort office were constantly being established… I was so overwhelmed by what I heard that I couldn't do anything. Although my mother's illness was no longer a concern.</p>

<h3>Chairman Jiang Attaches Importance to Production Education</h3>
<p>| Instructing on Four Key Points for Implementation |</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang recently visited Hangzhou, and his speeches at the Provincial Government and the Aviation School focused mainly on education. It is learned that a military order was issued to Zhejiang yesterday, ordering the Provincial Government to instruct the Education and Construction Departments to prepare a production education plan for review. The original order is extracted as follows: "Political education and production are the priorities of national salvation and the foundation for national revival. When considering the powerful nations, none of them, after being devastated, did not rise up quickly and integrate production into education as an effective measure, using each other to inspire themselves and strive for strength. Only by being diligent can they succeed. When I was commanding troops in Wuhan the year before last, I deeply understood that without rectifying politics, there would be no way to eliminate the source of chaos, and without integrating education and production into one, there would be no way to achieve social stability. I issued Secret Order No. 647 to plan for the cooperation of construction and education, and Secret Order No. 539 to promulgate the General Outline of Implementation Principles for Political Education, Education Production, and Production Education. Now, it is found that the education and construction departments of various provinces and commissioners are mostly able to implement the laws earnestly, but there are also those who are still planning and handling them improperly. The key points are hereby instructed again: 1. If agricultural farms and agricultural and forestry experimental schools have not yet been prepared in the residences of the commissioners, they shall submit written plans to the competent authorities for review within ten days of receiving this document, without further delay. 2. Agricultural and forestry training classes are particularly important. If they have not been established in the residences of the commissioners, they should be prepared immediately, and the competent authorities of each province should check and consider the situation in each county and establish them as appropriate. 3. In order to cultivate the spirit of endurance and service, teachers and students should engage in actual farming. The number of workers in each agricultural farm should be limited to two, and the number of workers in each agricultural school should be limited to four. The agricultural farms and agricultural schools that have already been established should implement this principle from March of the 23rd year. 4. The General Outline of Implementation Principles for Political Education, Education Production, and Production Education, items 2, 3, and 4, are of great importance to production education and political reform. The work reports and inspection reports of each commissioner should be carefully examined and reported to the ministry item by item and section by section. The education and construction departments of each province should also examine the schools, factories, and agricultural farms at any time to see whether they are earnestly improving according to the general outline of principles, and report the improvement situation at any time. The above instructions are issued separately. This order is hereby issued to be obeyed and implemented, and to be instructed to be obeyed and implemented in a unified manner. The date of receipt shall be reported. This is a very important order."</p>

<h3>Fujian Education Circle Demands Back Payment of Old Debts from the Pseudo-Government, Chen Yi Considers it an Out-of-Line Action</h3>
<p>| Out of Concern, the Annual Holiday is Abolished and Half a Month's Education Fees for February are Allocated in Advance |</p>
<p>After Zheng Zhenwen, the Director of the Fujian Education Department, took office in November of the 21st year (1932), he made extraordinary efforts in education facilities. During the rebellion of the rebellious army in Fujian, he left the province for Beijing to report the circumstances. The Central Government highly praised him for not joining the rebellion. Recently, after the rebellion was suppressed, he was re-appointed to the important position of Director of Education. The schools and social education institutions in Fujian also sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education, urging Mr. Zheng to return to the south as soon as possible. However, Mr. Zheng believed that the education funds of Fujian Province relied solely on salt tax revenue, but it was often affected by local unrest. Not only could new facilities not be gradually developed, but the original budget also faced difficulties. Unless special funds were determined, there would be no way to cope with it. He accompanied Commissioner Lin Zhiyuan to meet with the central financial and educational authorities, stating the suffering of the Fujian education circle and requesting relief measures. Finally, he drafted a report and presented it to Chairman Chen through whom it was submitted to Minister of Finance Kong for review. Minister Kong replied that the central government's finances were also difficult, and it was impossible to reissue old debts. From now on, the central government should allocate funds on a monthly basis, and education funds could be settled. After Mr. Zheng arrived in Fujian, he convened the principals of various schools and informed them of the negotiation process. He also led the principals to meet with Chairman Chen. The Chairman stated that under the current difficult financial situation, there were no funds to issue old debts. In the future, he would be responsible himself. He asked them to inform the faculty and staff to share the difficulties and try their best to maintain operations. However, the faculty and staff convened meetings for days, insisting that the old debts could not be cancelled, that 150% of the annual holiday fee should be paid, and threatened with a general strike. Chairman Chen was extremely furious upon hearing this. The education fee issue had been determined after several negotiations with the central government. Furthermore, the new provincial government was established on February 1st. How could the faculty and staff ask him to be responsible for the debts owed by Cheng Ren and the pseudo-government? Such an out-of-line behavior was extremely inappropriate and should be severely punished to serve as a warning to others. Out of concern, he specially ordered the Salt Affairs Inspection Branch Office to raise half a month's education fees for February in advance during the holiday. The responsible agency was responsible for collecting and distributing them separately.</p>

<h3>Marek Discusses Danish and Chinese Civic Education in Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Danish Rural Civic Education Can Serve as a Reference for China</p>
<p>▲ Civic Education in Wuxi, Dingxian, and Beiping Has Gradually Developed</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) After arriving in Beiping, Marek, the president of the Danish International People's College, lectured at Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and other schools, and was quite busy. The reporter specially visited Mr. Marek to inquire about the purpose of his visit to China and his impressions of visiting various places. Mr. Marek's replies were sincere. Today (the 8th) at 10:30 a.m., Marek lectured on Danish civic education in the eighth classroom of the Normal University, with the meaning focusing on higher civic education. The talks and lectures are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Marek's Talk</h3>
<p>After shaking hands with the reporter, Marek immediately made the following remarks: "I came to China to give lectures in various places and to take the opportunity to visit Chinese civic education. The Jiangsu Educational College in Wuxi has a well-organized structure, and the students' level is also high, similar to the higher folk high schools in Denmark. The Dingxian Mass Education Experiment Zone can indeed serve as a model mass education zone. There are many mass schools in Peiping. According to Chinese friends, there are more than one hundred mass schools in Peiping, which shows the development of mass education in China in recent years. However, Chinese mass education differs from Danish mass education in many respects. (1) Most of the Chinese mass schools are established by the government, while the Danish mass schools are all private. The government subsidizes the funds, but does not interfere with the school administration. (2) Chinese mass education focuses more on children's mass education, while Danish mass education focuses on working adult populations. China is an agricultural country, and Denmark is also an agricultural country. I hope that China and Denmark will join hands in the field of mass education in the future to jointly seek the universalization and practicalization of agricultural education. The staff of the Dingxian Mass Education Experiment Zone are very hardworking, and the equipment is also thorough. I hope that the staff will continue to work hard and seek further progress. Agricultural production in China has gone bankrupt in recent years. I hope that Chinese comrades, for the mass education in rural areas, regardless of official or private mass schools, will take into account the needs of the local environment and focus on agricultural arts or agricultural mass education. However, the Danish countryside is different from the Chinese countryside. Danish rural mass education can only be offered to China for reference. It is not necessary for Chinese rural mass schools to have the same facilities as Danish rural mass schools." I plan to stay in Peiping for a short time and then go to the United States and Canada to visit mass education, he said.</p>
<h3>Danish Civic Education</h3>
<p>Marek gave a lecture at 10:30 a.m. today (the 8th) in the eighth classroom of the Normal University, with more than 400 people attending. First, the president of the Normal University, Li Zheng, gave an introductory speech, followed by Marek's lecture in English on "Danish Civic Education," which was translated by Professor Chuan Baochen of the Normal University. It roughly stated that Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have come to your country from faraway Denmark. Today, I am very honored to have this opportunity to gather with you all. In Denmark, one-quarter of the farmers receive higher civic education. There are 51 farmer folk high schools, all of which are government-run. The government subsidizes the funds, but the school administration is not interfered with by the government. Most Danish farmers participate in general elections after graduating from higher folk high schools, so the level of Danish farmers is relatively high. Although Denmark's international status cannot reach the highest point, civic education has a considerable position in the international arena. Sweden, Norway, and Finland have also established folk high schools due to the influence of Danish civic education. Denmark has established the International People's College, which has been around for 13 years. There are usually 1,500 students, and the number of students in the winter short-term specialized courses increases to 2,000. Because farmers are more idle in winter, the number of students increases. Students from various countries study at the same school, understand each other, and students from various countries can obtain special materials from various countries, which is also a very interesting thing, he said. After the lecture, slides were shown, and the meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m., he said.</p>

It is understood that the 13th session of the school's night school department is scheduled to open today, with a total of about 200 students in each subject. The classes offered this semester include bookkeeping and introductory accounting, advanced accounting, bank accounting, cost accounting, and auditing. The teachers of each subject are all the main staff of the Lixin Accounting Firm. As for the textbooks for each subject, they are all written by the school's president, Dr. Pan Xulun, and the school's specialized teachers. The content is rich and the compilation is excellent, making them very suitable for teaching, it is said.</p>

It is heard that the school's general courses, normal courses, business courses, and primary school department still have vacancies and can be enrolled. New and old students who do not arrive at the school within a week will not have their places reserved.</p>
<p>▲ Huiping Middle School: Since its establishment, Huiping Middle School in this city has been well-planned and strictly disciplined, so its achievements are outstanding and there are many students. The school was originally on Albert Road. Later, due to the sudden increase in the number of students, the original school building was not enough, so it moved to 13 Dumei Road in the last semester. During the winter vacation, those who requested to join the class were even more enthusiastic. In order to meet the students' desire for knowledge, the school has expanded its school building and increased the size of its classrooms from this semester. In recent days, new and old students have been enthusiastically registering. However, it is heard that there are still vacancies and enrollment is still in progress. In terms of teachers, several experts who have graduated from universities and specialized schools at home and abroad have been newly hired to teach various courses.

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Correspondence School Enrollment</h3>
<p>▲ Divided into Elementary, Advanced, and Translation Classes</p>
<p>▲ Instructors Include Famous Figures Such as Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Correspondence School was initiated by Yuan Wenzhang, a Japanese language professor at National Jinan University and the College of Political Science and Law, and others. Mr. Yuan has studied in Japan for many years and has a profound understanding of Japanese. He has authored three volumes of contemporary Japanese textbooks, as well as "Rapid Japanese Conversation" and "Japanese Correspondence," among others. The school is divided into three classes: elementary, advanced, and translation guidance. The elementary class is for beginners to learn pronunciation, with special methods employed, so learning pronunciation is not difficult at all. Its effectiveness is the same as direct listening. The advanced class studies literary works, advanced grammar, letter writing techniques, and conversation, etc. The translation guidance class specializes in guiding the translation of Japanese books and newspapers. Students can submit their trial translations for modification and correction. Enrollment for all classes has now begun. There are no qualifications required for students. Anyone interested in studying Japanese can enroll. Enrollment procedures and fees are detailed in the school's regulations. The regulations will be sent upon request.

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Report on Vocational Education by a Ministry of Education Commissioner on Educational Inspection in Europe (13)</h3>
<p>(1) Water and Forest School This school is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and has a forest area of 3,450 hectares. Each hectare is 10,000 square meters, which is equivalent to slightly less than 20 mu in our country, making a total of approximately 38,000 mu. It has one principal, four professors, and two lecturers, with an administrative committee organization similar to a university, and also has one secretary-general and one director of affairs. Students are divided into two categories: (1) formal students, who are prospective government officials for water and forest administration, and (2) free students, who are foreign students and domestic students who attend lectures at will. In addition to teaching courses, professors also undertake research work. The basic subjects that students of each department should study are (1) biology, (2) botany, (3) zoology, and (4) soil properties, etc., applied to forests and waterways. In addition, there are practical mathematics, building construction, and forest regulations, forestry administration, etc. English and German are also taught as preparation for reading reference books. The academic year is divided into two semesters: winter is for studying theory, and summer is for practice. There is an examination once a year, and only those who pass can advance to the next grade. Forest research within the school is divided into four departments: 1. Research on forest production and climate; 2. Research on forest plants; 3. Research on forest animals; 4. Afforestation research. Research work in progress includes: 1. Soil: research on the acidity, alkalinity, and organization of other components of the soil; 2. Wood grain: the internal fiber texture of wood varies depending on the species of wood, and the differences are very obvious when viewed under a microscope; 3. Research on microorganisms in water; 4. Experiments on the load-bearing capacity of wood. The equipment is as follows: 1. Chemistry laboratory; 2. Botany laboratory; 3. Zoology laboratory; 4. Wood testing laboratory; 5. Botanical garden. The school collects specimens in the following departments: 1. Tree specimens, from France and abroad; 2. Forest game; 3. Forest beasts; 4. Fish in French rivers; 5. Fossil specimens; 6. Mineral specimens; 7. Soil specimens. Soil specimens from all over France are on display for research, stored in small square cabinets, about one meter high. The soil quality gradually changes its organization, color, and viscosity from the ground up, which is clear at a glance.</p>
<p>The areas of the French Alps and Pyrenees mountains, where plants could not grow in the past, have been studied and transformed by the school, and have been transformed into lush forests in sixty years.</p>
<p>Lyon</p>
<p>1. Industrial Chemistry School This school was originally a private school subsidized by the government, but recently it has been entirely maintained by private chemical manufacturers, but it is affiliated to the university administration. Most of the school's directors are industrialists. The president of the University of Lyon is also one of the directors. The academic program is divided into three years, as follows: first year - inorganic chemistry and analysis; second year - organic chemistry; third year - (first semester) applied chemistry, (second semester) dyes, perfumes, electrochemistry, and microbiology, leather making.</p>
<p>Emphasis is placed on experimental work, so there is a lot of practical work. Students entering the school do not need to be graduates of higher middle schools who have obtained a baccalaureate, but they must pass an entrance examination. The laboratory and equipment are spacious and well-equipped. Professors all have research rooms.</p>
<p>(2) Leather Making School This school has been established for forty years. When it was founded, the leather making industry was still very immature. There were no experts or books. Now it has gradually achieved results. The academic program is divided into three years. In the first two years, students learn general chemistry and principles. In the third year, emphasis is placed on leather making practice. Professors also do a lot of research work. The school's organization is similar to that of the Industrial Chemistry School. The board of directors is also composed of representatives of factory owners. The government does not provide subsidies, only acts as an advisor and supervisor.</p>
<p>(3) Central Engineering School This school is a private engineering school. Its organization is similar to a joint-stock company. The board of directors is responsible for planning the economy. The academic program is divided into four years. The first year is a preparatory course, so the regular course is only three years. Students entering the school must pass an examination. Those who directly take the regular course must first obtain an advanced mathematics certificate. In the first and second years of the regular course, students must obtain three certificates: (1) General Mathematics Certificate, (2) General Physics Certificate, and (3) Mechanics Certificate, before they can enter the third year.</p>
<p>The third year is divided into three departments: 1. Civil Engineering</p>
<p>General Civil Engineering</p>
<p>2. Mechanical Engineering Mech Engineering</p>
<p>Electrical Technique</p>
<p>The professors are all current engineers, so students get practical knowledge.</p>
<p>(4) National Vocational School This school is divided into two departments: (1) Higher Elementary School, (2) National Vocational School. The courses taught are also divided into general education and practical arts courses. The arts courses are metalwork, foundry work, model making, woodwork, industrial design, instrument design, watchmaking, etc. In the advanced commercial class, literature, accounting, stand and English, German, Italian, or Spanish are also taught.</p>
<p>The academic program is divided into four years. The daily study hours are from eight to ten hours. The weekly practical work is 32 hours, and the theoretical study is 20 hours. After four years of graduation, only those who pass the examination will be awarded a certificate. If students of this school want to go to a higher vocational school, they must add preparatory subjects for further education in the third and fourth years, such as mathematics and physics. Additional training is required to ensure connection. However, these students who want to further their education must be the best in the class. Most of the teachers are current engineering personnel or have sufficient experience. Tuition is free. Students at this school must pay 2,400 francs for all board and lodging expenses. The practical factories are divided into the following types: (1) Woodworking model, (2) Sand casting, (3) Forging, (4) Metalworking, (5) Not clear, (6) Clock and watch factory. The following characteristics of professors are noteworthy: (1) In the sand casting practice class, the shortcomings of students' work are clearly pointed out and displayed in a special place for public criticism and recognition; (2) In the forging and blacksmithing department, each practical work must first be given to students with a blueprint, and the steps from raw materials to finished products in each stage are marked on the blueprint, so that students can follow the blueprint and gradually advance, which is very clear. In recent years, France has often combined elementary and higher schools with national vocational schools in one school. The former emphasizes general education, while the latter pays attention to arts and crafts training, and the level is the same. Therefore, students can transfer from one department to another according to their interests, which is an aid to employment guidance and a new trend in French education.</p>
<h3>(4) British Vocational Education</h3>
<p>At the beginning of its development, education at all levels in Britain relied heavily on the efforts of private individuals and public groups. This was true for secondary education and primary education, and it was also true for vocational education. When we read the history of British vocational education, we can see that in Britain at that time, industry and commerce were already highly developed, and it still took so long to achieve results, which shows that vocational education is not easy to promote. The motivation for British vocational education was the 1851 Industrial Exhibition, which made people aware of the importance of science applied to industry and commerce. Therefore, in 1853, the Department of Science and Art was established, which belonged to the Ministry of Commerce. The government allocated special funds to encourage schools teaching science. The department was responsible for the overall success, and the amount of the bonus depended on the students' achievements. However, the scope of the bonus was limited to natural sciences, and did not include industrial education. In 1880, the London Trades Association was established, and the trades associations collected money to subsidize engineering subjects, and industrial education was thus blessed and made progress day by day. For more than fifty years, with the government's advocacy and incentives, and the efforts of public groups, British vocational education has become a grand sight. Technical colleges are all founded by private individuals. Their initial purpose is to integrate morality, physical fitness, and group activity as the foundation of training, to be an educational institution and a place for self-cultivation. Administrative affairs are presided over by a committee, and the London Municipal Committee must have a considerable number of representatives participating in the affairs. In order to avoid duplication in subjects, the technical colleges all agree in advance to teach certain engineering subjects, such as mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, as one category, chemical engineering as one category, and architectural engineering as another category. Each is undertaken by one technical college or several colleges. This is the general situation. Most junior industrial and commercial schools are attached to technical colleges, but vocational schools for women are still mostly separated.</p>
<p>Industrial schools, established by the London Municipal Committee, are mostly specialized in nature, such as printing schools and architectural schools, but there are also multi-disciplinary schools. The management rights are all in the hands of the Municipal Committee, and part of the administrative duties are delegated to the advisory committee of each school by the Municipal Education Committee, which is responsible for handling them.</p>
<p>Supplementary Schools Supplementary education can be divided into two categories: one is supplementary vocational subjects, and the other is supplementary general education. The academic level is quite uneven. Supplementary vocational subjects are the most important work in the current vocational education system in Britain. All advanced classes and specialized classes of industrial schools are included. These subjects are mostly taught in evening classes, but the engineering and construction industries sometimes allow their employees to attend classes during the day, but this is still a minority. General supplementary subjects are divided into day classes and evening classes, which are designed for employees and workers to continue their primary school education and supplement their general knowledge.</p>
<p>National Certificate Examination One of the most special points in British vocational education, which is not found in other European countries, is the national certificate examination at all levels. This examination is divided into two categories: the first category is the certificate examination, and the second category is the diploma examination, and each category is further divided into advanced and specialized types. Both the certificate and diploma examinations require three or two years of study in a technical college or vocational school before one can participate. The right to award certificates and diplomas is controlled by the Ministry of Education and the Engineers Association. For example, when a technical college establishes a mechanical engineering certificate course, it must first submit the plan to the Ministry of Education and the Mechanical Engineers Association. The two institutions will conduct a detailed examination. If the mechanical equipment is well-equipped, the teachers are qualified, and the curriculum and teaching materials are appropriate, then the establishment of the course is allowed. Other certificate or diploma courses, such as electrical engineering and chemical engineering, must also go through the same procedures when they are established. There are now five types that have been approved for establishment: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, shipbuilding engineering, chemical engineering, and architectural engineering, which have been jointly reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education and the five engineering associations.</p>
<p>The curriculum of each subject is divided into supplementary classes and specialized classes. The subjects of each course are prescribed in advance and are called joint subjects. For example, the general engineering course combines mechanical drawing, applied mechanics, mathematics, and other subjects into joint subjects. For electrical engineering, the joint subjects are electrical principles, mathematics, mechanics, mechanical drawing, electrical design, and electrical transportation. The organization and distribution of the joint subjects for other chemical and mechanical engineering courses are roughly similar. The teaching materials for supplementary classes are slightly simpler and are called supplementary joint subjects. The level of specialized classes is higher and is called specialized joint subjects. Those who study in supplementary classes are only given certificates, and those who study in specialized classes are given diplomas. Certificates and diplomas are divided into ordinary and advanced types. Students who are 14 or 15 years old when they enter school, or who have studied in junior vocational schools for more than two years, can enter advanced supplementary classes. The course is three years long, and at least 150 hours of instruction must be provided each year (the minimum limit for chemical engineering courses is 180 hours per year). There are three evening classes each week. Those who pass the graduation examination are given ordinary certificates. Students who are older and have a higher level, and who study in specialized supplementary classes, have a course of two years. Those who pass the graduation examination are given advanced certificates.</p>
<p>Those who study in specialized classes, if they enter advanced specialized classes, are given ordinary diplomas after graduation. Those who enter specialized specialized classes are given advanced diplomas. The course length is at least three years (the Chemical Engineers Association only gives certificates and does not give diplomas because the students' results are not good).</p>

Although London spot gold fell by 2 shillings and 1 pence, American cotton fell by 10 pounds per sound, and American wheat rose slightly. HSBC's listed prices for both British and American currencies have been extended. The morning's rough opening broke 690 yuan immediately. Major players such as Hongli, Yifeng, Yongyuan, and Maoyong all sold, so although it rose, it still fell. After the opening, due to the strong appetite of banks, and at the same time, they raised shillings, people saw the bottom and became firm. Major players made some purchases, and gold prices gradually rose, and the trend was quite good. HSBC's listed price was also unchanged. The market was quite flat at first, hovering uncertainly. Later, as the domestic market continued to tighten, although the Dalian gang came to cash out futures, the market was even stronger because supply could not meet demand. Looking at the market situation for the day, although it fell, the situation can be said to be stable. There are no special overseas telegrams. As of today, the lineup for March consists of 31 bulls and 51 bears. Now I will record the market situation for the day,</p>

After the closing, although Hengxing sold, Yuanmaoyong and others entered, and the situation was relatively stable. Looking at the highest price for the day, 696 yuan, and the lowest price, 688.3 yuan, there was a difference of 7.7 yuan. As a result, it fell by 7.2 yuan compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>The revealed price was because the shilling price rose a total of 25 during the holiday period, which was 1 shilling and 4 and a half pence. The combined gold price with the foreign exchange was 700 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 5 yuan, which was about 4 yuan less than the closing price before the holiday. The registration for this month was 703 yuan, and for March it was 693 yuan. The morning replenishment water was 703 yuan, and the afternoon replenishment water was 705 yuan. The raw price was 1,113 yuan. Due to the level change relationship, there were fewer transactions in the field (today is still caoping). The front market rose from 1,113 yuan to 16 yuan. The after market rose again to 17 yuan. Both were bought by the customer gang. Finally, the Tianjin gang sold, and it fell again to 1,114 yuan. The whole day's ins and outs were chaotic, and the total turnover was about 1,000 taels.</p>

Shunli did a total of about 1,100, netting out less than 400. Guangbang Shenggda sold more than 400 strips, entering a small number. Hengxing entered more than 100 strips and exited more than 300 strips. As of that day, there were a total of 21,938 March chips.</p>
<p>Today, there has already been advance preparation for April's strips. In the morning, Jiatai sold seven strips to Xianghe at 987 yuan, and seven strips at 985 yuan.

<h3>After Full Resumption of Business by Chinese and Foreign Banks, Foreign Borrowing Still Occurs, Transactions Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and all Chinese and foreign banks fully resumed business. However, during this Lunar New Year, according to custom, transactions were not made, so the collection and settlement situation was abnormally sluggish. Even in the market, there was only a morning session. Foreign borrowing was still open for white borrowing. The head of the bank did not open because there was no afternoon market and no transactions. In the early morning, the turnover of the transfer of the ticket transaction was 890,000, and the new transaction was 450,000. In the small general meeting, the transaction was 340,000. The collection and settlement of foreign public bills by the money houses was 9,560,000. There was no news of foreign transfer. The collection of banknotes was also minimal. The collection of various items by foreign banks was only several hundred thousand. Chinese banks were also only several hundred thousand. The collection and settlement situation was very desolate. In the afternoon, it was simply similar to closing down. The transaction of subsidiary coins was also very simple. Jiangnan small foreign currency was 850 yuan in the early morning, with a transaction of 4,000 jiao. Guangdong small foreign currency was 786 yuan, with a transaction of 25,000 jiao. Copper coins increased by 2,000 wen, which was 312,000 wen, with a transaction of 31,200 strings, calculated at a price of 10,000 yuan.

<h3>Securities, Bonds, and Red Board See High Prices Item by Item</h3>
<p>Reorganization Bonds See New High Price Again</p>
<p>Troop Reduction Nears 70 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>New Year Only Has Two Morning Sessions, Full-Day Trading Resumes on the 27th. Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange opened its first trading day of the New Year. After a nine-day recess, the environment remained stable and unchanged. Although Sun Dianying was still fighting like a trapped beast, the resolution was expected to be near. Market sentiment was high and cheerful. After the opening bell, prices rose item by item. Various syndicates, such as Nos. 3, 4, 23, 47, and 54, bought in considerable quantities. Nos. 11, 15, and 21 saw some selling. Trading was considered active and prosperous. Market prices mostly rose by 20 to 80 cents. The market prices of various items mostly saw new highs again, and the situation was very firm and bullish, which can be called a good phenomenon in the public bond market. In the second session, No. 21 was also replenished. Most syndicates bought more than they sold. Reorganization bonds saw a new high price of 40 yuan again. Troop reduction bonds reached 69 yuan 85 cents. The 70-yuan mark was about to break through. The 1921 Customs bonds were relatively stable. The 2020 Tobacco bonds were slightly weak. No. 53 bought a lot of 2021 Customs bonds, which also became stable. Consolidated taxes continued to improve by 20 to 30 cents. However, salt taxes saw a slight weakness due to selling households. As a result of the two sessions, prices rose by several cents to 1.30 yuan. The afternoon session was temporarily suspended due to the New Year. Full-day trading resumed on the 27th. The total turnover was 14,454,000 yuan, including 4,000,000 yuan in spot goods, 5,235,000 yuan in consolidated salt tax futures, 1,700,005 yuan in troop reduction bonds, 1,170,000 yuan in 1921 Customs bonds, 2,520,000 yuan in 2020 Tobacco and Customs bonds, 3,180,050 yuan in regular gold short contracts, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Shows Slight Discrepancies</h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Trading Company on the 17th stated that the New York stock market showed discrepancies and minimal fluctuations. This was because the issue of regulating the exchange and investigating speculation in brewing and aviation stocks caused the public to take a wait-and-see approach for the time being. Oil and steel stocks rose due to good business news, especially in the Youngstown district, where production increased from 9% to 53%. Bond prices fluctuated. U.S. government bonds were stable. The price of silver reached 4.625 yuan, a new high since 1930, due to the general belief that the government would take good actions soon. Half-day turnover was 1.16 million shares. (Wheat) There was light rain in the southwestern drought area, and the market was slightly weak. (Cotton) According to various sources, the President's attitude favored the principle of the Bankhead Act, so it was possible to pass it in some way. However, it was difficult to determine which way would be taken. Factory demand slightly eased. Speculators believed that the acreage reduction would eventually succeed and bought in slightly. Brokers' opinions were inconsistent. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>First Day After the Holiday, Yarn Market Suffers Sudden Selling Pressure</h3>
<p>| Opening of May-June Contracts Still Pending |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market opened for business on the first day after the Spring Festival holiday. It started with a certain factory continuing to purchase in large quantities, which shook the market. Prices for each month rose by about one yuan. At the same time, the actual demand from outside buyers became more active, and various parties took action. However, in the afternoon, the general public, believing that the domestic environment had not yet improved and remaining pessimistic about the commercial future, engaged in selling, and the market trend fell again. However, there are several points worth noting: namely, the season is still in the spring, overseas cotton industry is stable, and the base is small. The May-June contracts have not yet opened.</p>
<h3>Yarn Drops One Yuan</h3>
<p>In the pre-market session, Hui Kang acted on behalf of a certain factory to absorb stock, and market sentiment rose. Prices for each month rose by 2.5 cents. In the afternoon, retail investors sold off, and prices for each month fell by 5 to 9 cents. The total turnover for the day was 67,750 bales.

<h3>Disappointment in Expectations for Foreign Cotton, Bullish Traders Exit the Market</h3>
<p>▲ Cotton to Be Calculated in Catties Starting in July</p>
<p>The cotton market fell sharply, and the bearish trend intensified. Due to last year's sharp rise, most people expected that foreign cotton would continue to rise during the holiday. During this holiday, US cotton did not move, while Indian cotton rose slightly by 3 to 4 rupees. However, with the exchange rate rising, the calculated price per dan fell by one yuan compared to last year, and people's confidence weakened. Ningbo bullish traders exited the market with 20,000 dan. However, the intention of the large number of bullish traders remains firm. However, there is still no flaw in foreign cotton.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Plummets by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>In the pre-market session of Zheng Standard, bullish traders liquidated in large quantities, and market prices suddenly loosened. Prices for each month fell by 1.10 yuan to 1.05 yuan. At the noon closing, near-month contracts rebounded by 5 cents, and far-month contracts were flat. The total turnover for the day was 159,700 dan.

<p>April 4375 Down 100 174,600 Total 641,900</p>
<h3>Foreign Factories Purchase Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>Most of the current cotton sales are purchases by foreign factories. The statistics show that the sources include 1,513 bales of Tonghua cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet Cotton 43.25 Shanghai Factory Purchase 176 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Grain Market Suspended, Actual Sales Stagnant</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market prices for each month showed a uniform downward trend. After a suspension of more than ten days, the price of foreign wheat, although there was no huge fluctuation, the actual sales appetite in Canada remained weak. The flour taken by the large bullish traders in the previous month was mostly still in their hands, and this month is also a flat month. Counting the official trading days, there are less than ten days, and all futures must be settled. In addition, the price of spot foreign wheat in Argentina has loosened, and it is only calling for 4.15 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere was not stable. Then, Fuxin and Fufeng factories all had to sell to cope with the situation, and the market situation stepped downstream again. There were few new bullish traders, and old bullish traders also returned to the market, so the downward trend became more violent. As a result, the flour for this month fell by 3.5 cents before the market closed, March fell by 4 cents, April fell by 3.5 cents, May fell by 3 cents, June fell by 2.5 cents, and July fell by 3.25 cents.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Standard Likely to Enter Customs at 3 Yuan</h3>
<p>| Affected by Rice Prices |</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month, the recent period saw very little trading due to a lack of buyers and sellers. March only opened in the morning, priced at 4.0275 yuan, which was about 8 or 9 cents lower than before the market closed. June opened at 3.755 yuan in both the morning and afternoon, also down 8 or 9 cents. As for the new goods for July, the selling was very strong, partly because the weather was very good, and partly because the spot goods in Argentina were very cheap, so people's hearts were uniformly weak, and the downward trend was very strong, falling by a huge 1.2 cents compared to before the market closed. According to speculation by people in the industry, due to the low price of rice, the new standard may enter customs at 3 yuan, which is also possible. The current wheat has no market due to the guild, and only the packages have not been opened.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Sees a Significant Improvement on the Red Board</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The Red Board situation: the sources for each syndicate after the big year-end settlement last year, the successive arrivals at the port totaled more than 130 boatloads (more than 16,000 shi), of which the thick japonica rice from various syndicates accounted for the majority, and the late rice and various colors accounted for half. The sales markets in various regions were quite lively at the beginning of the year. Each syndicate's appetite could not be fully satisfied. The opening of the Red Board was much better than last year. For example, the thick japonica rice from Chang Syndicate, Su Syndicate, and South Port Syndicate increased by half a cent, and the late rice such as Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian each increased by an unusual amount. However, Dubu pointed rice and various colors were slightly mixed, rising by 10 to 20 cents or several points.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The eight-day Spring Festival holiday has ended. There are 60 to 70 boats in stock and arriving in He Xia. The sales appetite for each type of goods is all for social purposes, so it is very light. The opening prices for each type of goods are higher than the closing price by a cent, the price of white japonica thin rice is higher by a cent, the price of Yangbu pointed rice is higher by 2 cents, and the price of Ke pointed rice is higher by nearly a cent. The price of Yin Yuan and Bai Yuan is stable.</p>
<h3>Various Syndicates' Attitudes Towards the Trading of Foreign Indica Rice</h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Indica Rice Changed to 180 Catties Per Dan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign Indica rice on the Red Board was not very prosperous. This was because each syndicate was cautious and unwilling to sell and buy boldly. Moreover, the opening of accounts by the silver and money industry was pending, and the roots had not yet circulated. Quanzhou Syndicate originally had an appetite, but due to the exchange rate and silver root, there was no movement yesterday. Fuzhou Syndicate was slightly more accommodating, but not very active, and tens of thousands of bags had been shipped last winter, and the local needs were now sufficient. Ningbo Syndicate has a strong digestion, but it shipped 35,000 bags of foreign rice Indica rice at the end of last winter, and there is no need for it now. Therefore, only the local street and Min Sheng Yuan Syndicate purchased a total of 2,000 bags plus a small amount. The inventory of Indica rice is very abundant, but the owners do not want to sell lightly because the cost is high, and foreign rice has actually been taxed, and the taxation in Fujian Province will also be implemented in the coming days. Therefore, although the trading volume is small, the market remains strong. The small twisted foreign rice is up by 5 points compared to last winter, which is the reason for the foreign rice tax. The Fujian Syndicate purchased 242 bags of Hunan oil, priced at 7.5 yuan, 600 bags of unpolished oil, priced at 6.3 yuan, 750 bags of Mingguang Indica rice, priced at 6.85 yuan to 6.7 yuan, 155 bags of Nanjing Liu Indica rice, priced at 6.1 yuan, the local street purchased 76 bags of Jiangxi red late rice, priced at 7.1 yuan, 100 bags of Hunan machine oil, priced at 7.5 yuan, Jing 100 bags, priced at 6.3 yuan, Jing unpolished 150 bags, priced at 5.53 yuan, and 200 bags of small twisted rice were returned goods, priced at 6.85 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new measurement in this city, He Xia rice has long been changed to the city dou, but foreign Indica rice has not been changed due to customs reporting. Now that the customs have complied with the change, the grain industry has received instructions from the Municipal Social Bureau to change it. Therefore, from yesterday, each dan of foreign Indica rice has been changed to 180 catties by city scale, but calculated according to the old rules, it is still the same.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Lack Upward Momentum</h3>
<p>Spot miscellaneous grains officially opened yesterday, and market prices were all sold according to the whole city scale. The Red Board trading was still good, but the market conditions still lacked upward momentum. Yesterday, soybeans were traded by Fuzhou Syndicate and the local street. The factory did not move. A total of 13 or 14 cartloads of various beans were traded in the city. Market prices were high, flat, and secondary fixed. Green beans are colored goods, and the market conditions have not been insulted. Yesterday, 700 bags of Guide green beans were purchased from the interior. The local street purchased 250 bags of Dalian mixed green beans. Sand yellow Du beans were flat. Broad beans were opened for 600 to 700 bags of Ningbo goods, which were digested by Fuzhou Syndicate and foreign merchants. Market prices were quite stable. Green beans, Guang Syndicate, Little Luzon Syndicate, and Xiamen Syndicate all inquired. The total city traded 1,700 or 1,800 bags of bright and raw green beans. The market shape is temporarily stable. Sesame market prices have not changed much. Guang Syndicate purchased more than 700 bags of white sesame. Xiamen Syndicate purchased 42 bags of black sesame. Raw kernels are still weaker than peanuts.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, Oil Cakes Red Board Not Prosperous</h3>
<p>The Red Board market for soybean oil and peanut oil, because each firm had stocks in hand at the time of closing, and sales households in various places have not yet been listed, so most of the goods traded yesterday were social transactions. Market prices were 20 to 30 cents lower than at the time of closing. The decline in soybean cakes was even more severe, with a difference of 5 points compared to the closing market. The reason is that there has been no news from the mainland, and exports have been hit by direct transportation, and the market conditions are not prosperous.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, Daylily Suddenly Rises by Two Yuan on the Red Board</h3>
<p>| Black Dates and Walnuts Also Tend to Rise |</p>
<p>Daylily, because the stock of each firm is thin, and the various markets in Zhenjiang have not opened, the goods in Shanghai have also been pulled up. It is heard that only hundreds of bags were traded in the first session yesterday, with prices such as Daxing vegetables at 19.8 yuan and Township Village vegetables at 18.8 yuan, which is more than 2 yuan higher than before the Spring Festival. Judging from this situation, the future market is still expected to rise. The firms, in view of the flexibility of the sales channels of various syndicates, are also holding on tightly. Black dates and walnuts, because the sources have been scarce for a long time, and the stock is also sparse, the market prices have risen. For example, hand-picked peaches are 20 yuan, Shimen peaches are 18.5 yuan, Changping peaches are 18 yuan, Yanggu peaches are 17 yuan, Gaozhuang Yuan dates are from 15 yuan to 18 yuan, and black dates are 11 yuan to 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Coarse Sand White Returns Fall by 5 Cents</h3>
<p>| Five Fortunes Wen Bing Rises by 20 to 30 Cents |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, because the price of gold turned down, the guild's disk, such as the 24th coarse sand white return, fell by a small 5 cents, to 19.95 yuan. Transactions were still rare. Transshipment high ordinary goods were 6.8 yuan, No. 9 Dutch red was 15.95 yuan, No. 8 and 9 Dutch red was 15.7 yuan, and Chaoqing was not open because the sales channels of various syndicates had not moved. Only more than 100 bags of Longjiang Qing were opened, priced at 10.05 yuan to 10.06 yuan. More than 300 bags of Mianhu red were opened, priced at 14.7 yuan. Dozens of bags of Mianbai were opened, priced at 20.05 yuan. Zhiyang was 16.05 yuan. The factory's white fell by 10 cents, to 19.1 yuan. The Jianbing number plate only came from the Dalaiahua number plate, which opened more than 100 boxes of Wufu Wenbing, priced at 18.3 yuan per pile, which was 20 to 30 cents higher than before the Spring Festival. Hainan red flakes and green flakes have not yet been opened.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Deji Woolen Cloth Red Board Reports Rise</h3>
<p>Woolen cloth plate, yesterday Deji goods, Hua Futai first opened, compared to January, the average increase of 20 cents. However, the Red Board opening prices of most other peers were mostly the same as last year. Looking at the overall market atmosphere, Yuanzhigong woolen cloth and Yuan Chang yellow-gray plain-colored Huada woolen cloth are in short supply. Biji stripes and clip-colored Huada woolen cloth and other Japanese goods are flooded, and the Red Board opening price is slightly low. Future changes need to be shifted by the future road.

<h3>Prophecy</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Now, even the Chinese believe that this world cannot but change. Because they believe it will change, they want to know how it will change, so everyone loves to hear prophecies. Many magazine companies have therefore specifically created topics and asked people to make predictions. But those they invited are all people who specialize in writing articles, or, to put it nicely, intellectuals.</p>
<p>Originally, there was a specific type of person who made prophecies. China had astrologers, and foreign countries also had so-called prophets. They relied on "divine will" or "inspiration." But modern people no longer believe them much. What modern people believe are the predictions of intellectuals, because they make comprehensive observations based on objective facts and then deduce the inevitable "fruit" from the established "cause." This is more scientific, so everyone believes them, and they make predictions with great certainty.</p>
<p>However, the predictions of intellectuals still rarely have accuracy. Because the observation and reasoning abilities of intellectuals are fundamentally subject to various limitations. For example, the observation of an intellectual of the bourgeoisie can only be detailed in the affairs of the bourgeoisie, and the deduction is only based on the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. The affairs and fate of other classes will inevitably be ignored. Needless to say, such predictions are not very reliable.</p>
<p>Moreover, when intellectuals make deductions based on scientific methods, no matter how rigorous and solemn their arguments and reasoning are, they can never escape the concept of gradual change. If the changes in society were always gradual, then the predictions of intellectuals might be correct by chance. However, changes in society are actually often sudden. This sudden change is not without a "cause," but the existence of its "cause" is originally obscure and not easily seen by the general public. The general public only sees some obvious "causes" and deduces the future "fruit" based on this, but they do not know that the future "fruit" is often determined by potential "causes," beyond the expectations of the prophets.</p>
<p>For example, when talking about World War II, most prophets believed that it would occur in 1936. But what would happen after it occurred? The prophets could not explain it. Aside from imagining how bombers would destroy cities and how poison gas would take lives, they could not think of any other results. Such predictions make the public despair and thus cultivate a passive concept of fatalism. On the other hand, it makes people in the morbid state of the end of the century feel excited by the great stimulation, which in turn promotes the realization of war. This kind of prophecy is very harmful.</p>
<p>World war is indeed a crisis of destruction, but if a kind of power accidentally erupts among the masses of the world, it may not be possible to turn danger into safety and make it a turning point for a new life. Some may think that "chance" is too uncertain, but in fact, there is no so-called chance in the development of history. What is accidental is just the necessity that we have never seen. Moreover, it is the masses who create history. In the past, the chaos of the masses made the darkness last for a long time. In the future, the awakening of the masses will surely make the light appear suddenly. And the awakening of the masses is not a hopeless thing, so we do not need to despair of the crises that today's prophets are flaunting.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remembrances of a Poetic Soul</h3>
<p>— Luo Ailan</p>
<p>——Mourning Zhu Xiang</p>
<p>Ziyuan, this morning I was reading a newspaper in the Columbia Chinese Library when I unintentionally read the news of your suicide in the Yangtze River. Ziyuan, are you really no longer among the living? Or am I dreaming? But the words on the newspaper were vivid and real, and the room was full of sunlight, how could this be a dream?</p>
<p>From the sparse hundred-odd words in the newspaper, I can see that the reason for your suicide was poverty. Alas, Ziyuan, you should have understood that society simply cannot accommodate poets, and the masses are the executioners of genius. It is your misfortune to be a poet, and even more unfortunate to be a genius poet. Even if you didn't commit suicide, society and the masses would still want to kill you.</p>
<p>Some people will say that your suicide was an act of weakness, but such people simply do not understand you and are just echoing what others say. If you were truly weak, you would have humbled yourself to survive, you would have wagged your tail and begged for mercy, and you would never have dared to topple [redacted] great idols for the sake of art and truth, or used toilet paper to write letters to denounce [redacted] once extremely popular editor. If you hadn't offended these academic authorities, literary giants, and their minions, you might now be sitting pretty, perhaps as a dean or director of some university. However, you didn't, you preferred poverty, you preferred suicide. Could someone without courage do such a thing?</p>
<p>Ziyuan, although society mistreated poets, the works of poets remain in the world forever. Your body may have disappeared forever with the waves of the great river, but your complete personality remains forever in the hearts of your friends, and your poems and writings will shine forever, as eternal as the sun and moon. Ziyuan, thinking of this, you should be smiling in the afterlife!</p>
<p>However, your death means that I have lost a good companion in the anti-Friends group, and a bright star has fallen in the literary world. This sorrow is forever difficult to dispel, and this loss is forever impossible to make up.</p>
<p>Genius is rare in the world, and it is even rarer to find genius who can cherish themselves, work hard, and be faithful to art. Ziyuan, you have gone to eternal sleep, what more can we say!</p>
<h3>Translation and Introduction</h3>
<p>— Ren Baige</p>
<p>I have always thought this way: rather than piecing together a so-called original essay by plagiarizing from here and there, it is better to honestly translate the original works separately in order to fulfill the responsibility of introducing them. Of course, this does not mean that I am belittling original creation. In fact, plagiarism can also be said to be an introduction, and perhaps it is more suitable for those who only seek something that is easy to read and understand. However, someone who is truly dedicated to learning will likely say impolitely: this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>After all, because there are too few people who can speak impolitely, this trend continues to be popular. From partial plagiarism to complete appropriation, this was already quite remarkable, but recently many more variations have emerged: some take the approach of commenting on ancient books, copying other people's articles piece by piece, adding a bit of commentary at the end that can be considered their own opinion, and presenting it as an article; others translate the entire article, put their own name in the author's position, and relegate the original author's name to the back of the article to hide. This is naturally much more sophisticated than simply copying and appropriating, mainly because it leaves a retreat that they believe is very safe.</p>
<p>It is said that in the West, when translating famous works, the translator's name is often not signed, so that the original author's status is not taken away by the translator. From this, it can be seen that this kind of practice is probably rarely seen in "foreign" and "ancient" times, but is unique to "Chinese" and "modern" times. I think everyone knows its value and fate, so there is no need for me to say more.</p>
<p>However, this leaves us with a problem that we cannot ignore: it is absolutely impossible to do as they do in the West and not sign the translator's name. The reason is very simple, to use an old saying, "It is permissible to have the ambition of Yi Yin, but to usurp without the ambition of Yi Yin is wrong." For example, a few years ago, when the trend of translation was once popular, a batch of clumsy translations for which no one was responsible, or seemingly many people were responsible, appeared on the market. It is said that these were things rushed out by several people working together for fear of being preempted, and as a result, no one dared to take responsibility, so they had to publish them without names or under pseudonyms. This kind of translation will naturally drag good things into the mud as well, so it finally ruined the entire translation industry. "Realizing that the past cannot be retrieved, knowing that the future can be pursued," can the Chinese cultural world withstand another such disaster and loss?</p>
<p>Now, because it is even more difficult to speak out, many opinions often have to be borrowed from other people's mouths, and many people are already proposing to accept the legacy of literature. Perhaps in the near future, translation will raise its head again. However, I hope first of all that it will not only be a timely piece of writing, but will become the beginning of a great work. Furthermore, it should generate many real and powerful things from "faithful introduction," "systematic introduction," and "critical introduction." Only in this way can it be said that we are truly accepting the "legacy."</p>
<p>Whether a nation can properly accept the culture of progress is the same as whether a person can listen to good advice. This can determine its fate and future. Will we let ourselves perish or grow?</p>
<h3>Birth</h3>
<p>— Xiuhu</p>
<p>This day, he wrote in his diary:——</p>
<p>× month × day In the early morning, around five o'clock, a man and a woman were slowly moving forward on the deserted road. The woman was crying out in pain, and the man supported her as she stood. After a while, they slowly moved forward again, speaking softly to each other, and sometimes even showing a smile. Those were me and Jinzhen. Jinzhen had started labor at three o'clock and was about to give birth. There were no cars nearby, and it was late at night, so we couldn't see any rickshaws either. We had no choice but to support her as we walked and waited for a car to take her to the hospital.</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, outside the door of Delivery Room No. 2 at the Red Cross Hospital, there was a man wearing a white coat like a doctor, with a white towel on his head, standing there anxiously, pacing back and forth, and peeking through the crack in the door from time to time. That was me.</p>
<p>A terrible scream came from the delivery room, which really made me anxious and restless. But this sound soon subsided. I looked through the crack in the door and saw her head lying crookedly on the operating table, her face covered with a piece of gauze. The doctor was performing surgery next to her with a scalpel. She had probably been anesthetized and passed out. I recalled the scene of her writhing in pain that I had just witnessed in the room, and I still couldn't help but shudder.</p>
<p>Although I had heard a lot about the pain of childbirth, how could I truly feel it unless I had experienced it myself? I remember the Japanese writer Hakuson Kuriyagawa comparing the birth of a new era to the pain of childbirth. The former is the struggle for human survival, while the latter is the struggle for human continuation of life. The two have the same value in the meaning of life. Both are equally arduous struggles. However, a hero who struggles for the era is often praised by all mankind, while women, who bear half of the arduousness of life, are still under oppression and are not cared for. Why is this?</p>
<p>If it is said that mankind created its own history, then on the credit book of creation, women alone bear half of the heavy responsibility of history because they produce the people who continue this historical creation.</p>
<p>At 2:50, the child was born. I saw through the crack in the door that the doctor was holding a grayish-white baby upside down. The body still had bloodstains from the mother's body. I couldn't help but faint, holding onto the door frame, trembling non-stop. This is a child, a flesh and blood separated from me and her? It was as if I had never thought about it before, that between us, there would be such a new life appearing before my eyes.</p>
<p>I immediately realized: this is my child, I am now a father. I immediately felt love for him. Yes, I will love him, I will work harder, for his happiness, for the happiness of all mankind. He should become the most complete member of society. Because he is a child of the new era, he bears a greater and more distant historical mission than I do. Jinzhen and I produced him, and in his hands, he will produce a new era.</p>
<p>The child cried, this was the first sound he made when he was born into the world. I hurried to check the time, it was 2:50.</p>
<p>I returned from the stairwell to the door of the delivery room, passing a ward, which was full of people, and some were crying. A patient there had just breathed their last and died. In the same minute, one person was born in the world, and another person died. The hospital is truly a dividing line of life. Some are born here, and some die here. The iron law of human metabolism is being played out on this line. My child represents the new, and that person represents the old.</p>
<p>At the door of the delivery room, I met the midwife, who told me that it was a "sister." I couldn't help but think immediately: "Many years later, she will be like her mother, perhaps lying in the same room, on the same bed, giving birth to the next generation."</p>
<p>The world is a river, and life is the flowing water in between. This child is just beginning to come into the world like flowing water.</p>
<h3>I Curse Your Smile (6)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>"It's really strange! He wants a woman from me… What women do I have! … I don't run a brothel! …"</p>
<p>"They just want those Baiyi girls…"</p>
<p>The boss pointed with his mouth to the rooms where the guests were sleeping, saying softly, acting like he understood everything. Then he added a sentence, meaning that I should be sensible and not show such an ugly face in front of the distinguished guests.</p>
<p>"We can't afford to offend them… These are people sent by the Bamu officials to inspect the roads… Opening a shop here, sigh, it's really…"</p>
<p>He didn't continue, sighing in distress.</p>
<p>I suppressed my anger and softened my voice slightly, saying:</p>
<p>"Are you asking me to take him to find one…"</p>
<p>The boss nodded.</p>
<p>But I said with a lot of aversion:</p>
<p>"I can't do such a thing, I can't, I can't, I can't… I don't understand Baiyi language… Wouldn't it be better to ask the landlady?"</p>
<p>The last sentence was almost said with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm, what are you saying! What are you saying!…"</p>
<p>The boss immediately lost his temper. He grabbed the flashlight in the foreigner's hand and stammered:</p>
<p>"Come, come… Sir, I, I'll take you, I'll take you."</p>
<p>Immediately, a painful realization, like a bullet, shot into my heart; could I really watch those poor Yi girls being abused? Looking at the sleeping Indian, he didn't say anything at all, just closed his eyes and shook his blue chin. He, like my boss, was trapped in a helpless situation.</p>
<p>Useless fellows! I cursed viciously in my heart, and at the same time, a flame of hatred ignited. I didn't want to do the unlucky job of sweeping horse manure and serving guests anymore. Tonight, I would give that foreign devil a good beating, and run back to China that night or the next morning. But thinking about leaving the trouble to this family and that Indian, I couldn't bear it. Moreover, it would put my three poor little students into the mouth of the tiger, which made me even more uncomfortable. Because they were too innocent, they never treated me like a shop assistant, but always respected and loved me like a teacher. However, could I close my eyes and let those Yi girls who were struggling hard in life be ravished? That was impossible for me! Absolutely impossible! So, I suddenly chased after the boss and that foreign devil.</p>
<p>But I didn't raise my fist, but only grabbed the flashlight in the boss's hand and said urgently:</p>
<p>"I'll do it!"</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm…"</p>
<p>The boss still looked very dissatisfied, but he didn't say anything. He handed the flashlight to me and quickly turned away. The way he looked was as if he was saying, if you can't get along with those Baiyi girls and you make a fuss, that's none of my business because this is what you volunteered to do.</p>
<p>So, this embarrassing and unpleasant job was all placed on my shoulders. But at this time, my heart was very calm, because the plan to deal with the matter had already been laid out in my mind in an instant. Walking to the door of the room where those Baiyi girls were sleeping, I suddenly stopped, stood in front of the foreign devil, and asked quietly:</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>The intention was to make him a little angry, deliberately pretending not to understand.</p>
<p>"I want a girl—deauful girlo"</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>One-Sentence Comments</h3>
<p>— Fei Ren</p>
<p>Since occupying the Northeast, Japan has been frantically preparing for war, undertaking large-scale construction projects, and building railways and the South Manchuria Railway, causing friction when it is in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>(Note) This is called asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Zhuang Jingke, a Fujianese who once held important positions such as ambassador to Japan and governor of Zhili Province, was suddenly shot and killed by a young man at his private residence on Fukushima Street in the Japanese concession on the eve of the abolished lunar New Year.</p>
<p>(Note) This is called killing a chicken to warn the monkey.</p>
<p>The puppet emperor will proclaim himself emperor next month, and recently sent Pan and Zhang secretly to Tianjin to prepare to contact traitors and hold a celebration.</p>
<p>(Note) This is purely a shameful act.</p>
<p>An electrical dispatch from Changchun on the 18th stated that thousands of righteous soldiers in the east of Heilongjiang twice defeated the Japanese army, and Sergeant Oshima was killed in battle.</p>
<p>(Note) This shows that the people's hearts have not completely died out.</p>
<p>British commercial representatives in Tokyo urged Japan to be self-aware, pointing out that it will become the world's public enemy.</p>
<p>(Note) I am afraid that Japan will not realize this until its death.</p>
<p>In the case of Qian Shaofeng avenging his father's death, the lawyer defended Qian, roughly saying that the defendant was filial and courageous and should be given a light sentence.</p>
<p>(Note) This is truly a good son.</p>
<p>In the bribery case of Japanese Minister of Education Hatoyama, the Ministry of Justice ignored it, and Hatoyama, in order to save face, resigned around the 21st.</p>
<p>(Note) The political morality of Japan can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The rent reduction movement is expanding day by day, and many foreigners have joined it.</p>
<p>(Note) This is not a small problem, but a serious problem that deserves attention.</p>
<p>During the Gregorian New Year, all sectors showed no interest, but during the abolished Lunar New Year, the people were busy celebrating the New Year and were particularly interested.</p>
<p>(Note) This shows the greatness of our people's "conservatism" and "worship of antiquity."</p>
<p>Britain and France held frank talks to find a compromise method for military reduction.</p>
<p>(Note) I don't think there is any way to find one here.</p>
<p>The King of Belgium died while mountain climbing, and all of Europe mourned.</p>
<p>(Note) Truly a good king.</p>
<p>The supervisor of the Zizhu Grove in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou accused the abbot of not only soliciting donations but also slandering him, so he hired lawyer Fan Ming to file a lawsuit against Mingjing in the First Special District Court for defamation.</p>
<p>(Note) This is truly looking for black-hearted people to eat vegetarian food.</p>
<h3>Street Hero</h3>
<p>— Daini</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, with a worried face, I must shake and swagger out on the first day of the New Year to enjoy myself, otherwise, it seems that I am letting down this annual New Year's Day (now it is said that there are two). I didn't have anyone coming to my door with lanterns on New Year's Eve, so I am naturally even more different from everyone else on the first day of the New Year. I don't burn incense at the City God Temple, but I have to take a look at the New Year's atmosphere. Embracing the feeling that I have aged another year, I confidently walk out of the door like an old man. But "slap" a sound startled me from behind. Looking back, several children above the age of children burst out laughing. Yes, firecrackers. The few copper coins deducted from debts on New Year's Eve are not enough to play a round of pai gow. It is more economical to set off a few firecrackers, not to mention that scaring people is a way of entertaining that harms others and does not benefit oneself. I can't remember my childhood. I don't know if I have ever wasted my New Year's money like this, no, amused myself. Now, because I think of myself as an old man, and it is the first day of the New Year, I should get some good luck. But shouting and scolding as soon as I walk out of the door will not get rid of my youthful vigor. So I also widened my throat and laughed. However, they didn't seem to expect an old man to have such an attitude. The second firecracker was used on a young woman. After running for a while, this behavior was everywhere. It really deserves to be called the New Year's atmosphere on the first day of the New Year. If I didn't have this bit of old energy, I might have bought a few to have fun; however, I was too embarrassed, so I just stood next to a stall and watched coldly. As long as they laughed, I laughed along with them. Isn't that the most economical way? The policeman standing in the middle of the road, I know that he also has an childlike innocence. Watching the frightened woman's face lose color, he opened his Shandong big mouth and laughed triumphantly. Naturally, today is the day of amnesty for rickshaw pullers. You can cross the road without following the rules, and turning small turns is even okay. The police officer does not have his usual slow-paced face. He ran to the stall and grabbed a few firecrackers to joke with the young women. The recipients seemed to have no courage to scold "damn you." The police officer is now a street hero, and of course there is no possibility of criticizing the hero's behavior! I don't know how many more first days of the New Year I can spend, but participating in this grand firecracker throwing ceremony every year is also a way to prolong life!</p>
<h3>Father</h3>
<p>— Xiren</p>
<p>My father died when I was six years old. My image of my father is so vague. Although I can recognize my father's appearance in the portrait, he is young and has no beard. When we children learned to be like adults, we would always touch our upper lip and cough dryly, thinking that being an adult should be like that. This kind of child's psychology continued until I grew up.</p>
<p>After being away from my hometown for three years, my father is still so young and has no beard. But my father's son is already very old. When I touched my beard, my fingers felt a slight stinging pain. I remembered what my grandmother said when I got married: "Poor people have no money, but passing on the family line is the same. You should also have a son to make me happy." So the old lady borrowed money to marry me off. Now I am also going to be a father, and the old lady is indeed happy. I looked at my father's portrait, thinking that the young man gave birth to me and left the world. After I became a father, I don't know how, and I even grew more stinging beards than my father. Every woman hopes that her son will get married sooner and have a grandson for her to hold. Because my father did not live long, my grandmother held me, her grandson, but lost her son, so she hoped to have a great-grandson in me to fill the void. The old lady's love is indelible. When I saw her silver hair, I immediately wanted to go home to serve her, leaving such an old person alone in a broken and too-large empty house. But she wanted me to get married. I drifted to Shanghai for life, and it has been three years. Wrinkles have risen on my forehead, and my beard stings my fingers. Although her grandson is aging so quickly, there will be a child to make her happy. I wrote to tell my wife that she was pregnant, and she wrote to ask my wife to go back, saying that you young people don't know how serious it is, don't force yourself, and don't do too much labor. My aunt and uncle came to Shanghai, and she might come to see me too. Women really like their sons and grandsons, and my wife is also planning what to get for the child; however, I cannot deny that I also like children. My liking for children is because children should make people happy. It is impossible to make a child happy just because I like children. Fathers are not as willing as they are.</p>

<h3>Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Walking from Sapporo Road, someone followed behind, shouting, "Sir, sir!" Looking back, it turned out to be a gray-uniformed soldier. I stopped and looked at him. He said sincerely, "Sir, may I ask which way to go to Longhua?" He was asking for directions. "Go straight ahead, out of the concession, and ask someone again. It's a long way." After I answered, I was about to walk away, but the man bowed and said with a smile, "Sir, I was dismissed from the army. I don't have the money to go home. Can you help me?" Asking for money! My heart was stunned. He continued, "I was originally a farmer at home, and then I became a soldier. Farmers want to be proud... Sir, you know, now I don't have the money to go home." I had something to do and couldn't wait for him to say more, so I gave him a few copper coins and went my way. He was still following behind, "Sir, give me more. I don't ask people for money casually." I gave him a few more copper coins, "That's enough, that's enough. I'm also a poor man without money. Go ask someone else." Saying that, I hurried away, and he turned to beg another person. Only then did I feel relieved. Unexpectedly, I had just slowed down when I heard, "Sir, I have no food to eat, give me two copper coins." It was a poor woman, holding a baby in her arms. I thought I wasn't a sir and could ignore it, so I went my way. Unexpectedly, a child followed, still shouting, "Sir, I have no food to eat..." To save trouble, I gave him two copper coins. The child saw a lady walking across the road. Ignoring the car's warning, he ran across the road in front of the car. I couldn't help but stop and shout, "Car, don't go!" But it was too late. The car stopped with a screech, and the driver cursed, "Little pig!" Sitting in the car was a noble lady and a small baby. Seeing this contrasting situation of mother and child of different wealth and poverty, a small wave rose in my heart, and this wave made my heart a little uneasy. However, I had something to do, so I went my way.</p>

<h3>Reading and a Way Out</h3>
<p>— Construction</p>
<p>In school, it truly feels like being in heaven. You don't have to worry about anything, calculate anything. Only when there's no money coming from home do you suffer some temporary poverty. However, that's just temporary, and it doesn't fundamentally affect the issue of eating. Once you're squeezed out of school, it truly feels like falling from the paradise of heaven into the eighteenth level of hell. Things you never had to worry about before, you now have to think about one by one. The comfortable and tranquil life from before seems separated by a layer of curtain, no matter what. What stands in the way is the issue of a job.</p>
<p>Usually receiving an education to become an official, and the mentality of parents wanting their children to become officials, no matter how you say it, is an embarrassing attempt. But people living under this social system can't help but speak this way. I oppose the fundamental spirit of this education. But right now, I can't help but find a way to solve my job problem, because opposition is one issue, and a job is another.</p>
<p>Although it's said that relying on the family at home may allow you to continue to be supported. But it's ultimately just support. And this fundamentally easily leads to alienation in family relationships, and a deep sense of guilt will inevitably arise from this. Why should we fall into such a state?</p>
<p>But when it comes to the job problem, I can't help but be stunned. How can I solve this job problem? I am a student of sociology. What should a student of sociology do?</p>
<p>Because of this kind of question, no matter how much one tries to get rid of it, one can't help but feel anxious. According to general social prejudice, those who have received little education are often high-ranking officials with generous salaries, and those who have muddled through university will be even more comfortable. But the reality is not that easy. The fact is here, it seems that people who have received higher education, specialized education, are the ones who can't find jobs. Does this ironclad evidence mean that society does not need people who have received higher education, or are people who have received higher education not worthy of finding jobs?</p>
<p>The spirit of education is to become an official, but the result of education is that there are no officials to be. It would be fine if there were no officials to be, but not even being able to find a place to eat can't help but make people frustrated. Life is necessary, but where can I find the way out I seek?</p>
<p>The way out for those who study politics is of course to become officials, but the way out for those who study engineering, mechanics, art, literature, commerce, education, and medicine is also to become officials: in the present, even the way out for those who don't study anything is to become officials. Officials are limited, but those who want to be officials are infinite, how will we solve our livelihoods?</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, it's just trouble again. I've always been troubled non-stop. I've visited countless friends here and there, and they are mostly equally stunned. The threat of unemployment is looming over our heads. Oh, you group of people!</p>

<h3>Unwilling to Marry</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a very difficult matter, and now I especially come to ask for your advice, hoping you can think of a way for me, because I am very troubled by this matter. After you receive this letter, please reply as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When I was a child, my parents arranged a marriage contract with Miss B. In 1932, when I was a little older and had some knowledge, I protested to my parents several times, but they always ignored me. Until the end of last year, my parents suddenly sent what is commonly called "the date" (i.e., the wedding date) to the other party, setting April of this year for me to get married. I am determined not to marry and resolved to dissolve the marriage contract, but my parents are very stubborn and have always been unwilling to dissolve the marriage contract. Also, Miss B's parents and my parents are cousins, and they are often together, so they have a good relationship. I also often meet Miss B, and after several conversations, I feel that Miss B has no learning and her knowledge is very simple. I have asked her to go to school to study, but she ignores me. Now I am determined to dissolve the marriage contract, and although I have not obtained my parents' consent, for the sake of my lifelong happiness, I have to propose it myself. But I am not yet an adult and cannot propose a dissolution. I am preparing to propose this matter directly to Miss B myself, which seems very promising. Is this the right thing to do? Please guide me. Also (after the dissolution), can the other party ask my side for any damages? What attitude should I have towards my parents now? What attitude should I have towards my parents after the dissolution? Finally, I must tell you that I am only nineteen years old and still studying in the second year of high school, and I should not be getting married at all. In short, this is my last struggle, effort, and fight. If I fail, I can only commit suicide. I earnestly ask you to reply to all of the above as soon as possible. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Li Siqin</p>
<p>Editor's note: Regarding the dissolution of marriage contracts arranged by parents, this mailbox has published a lot. Now, Mr. Li has raised the issue of underage persons dissolving marriage contracts, which should also be discussed.</p>
<p>Marriage and marriage contract are two different things: marriage is the fulfillment of the marriage contract, so not fulfilling the marriage contract arranged by parents, dissolving the marriage contract is certainly a straightforward means, but when this method cannot be used, "not fulfilling the marriage contract"丨 that is, not marrying is also a legitimate and effective method. Because the fulfillment of a marriage contract should depend on whether the marriage contract is legal (Main points of the judgment of the Supreme Court of 19th year, No. 35), and the dissolution of a marriage contract is legally stipulated that it can only be sued for dissolution after reaching adulthood. Moreover, "If one party does not wish to fulfill a marriage contract made by parents for their children, it is legally difficult to force." Therefore, it is not necessary for you to be so anxious to dissolve the marriage contract because the wedding date is approaching. It is fine for you to "not fulfill" it. However, "directly proposing dissolution to Miss B" is a good method, because marriage contracts should be autonomously decided by both parties!</p>
<p>As for the attitude towards your parents, we believe that you do not need to change your face. You should still be the same as before, because being dissatisfied with a marriage contract arranged by parents is not being dissatisfied with parents; moreover, parents arrange marriages for their children out of good intentions, and although we are unwilling to fulfill them, it is absolutely forbidden to harbor resentment. Therefore, after dissolving the contract or not fulfilling the marriage contract, you should sincerely tell your parents your reasons in detail, even if they are not happy, you should not be annoyed.</p>
<p>Damages should be determined by the specific circumstances. According to your situation, there is probably nothing too serious to "claim".</p>

<h3>Husband and Wife (3)</h3>
<p>— Yu Mei</p>
<p>"In these two or three years, there have been quite a few bankruptcies in various families."</p>
<p>"Is there a 'grass' radical in it?"</p>
<p>"Although not, it's not far off. Bosses don't dare to do business anymore. Your business is doing well."</p>
<p>"It's not good either. There are too many people, the burden is too heavy, and there's no profit to speak of."</p>
<p>Taking the candy packages wrapped by the young apprentices, and bidding farewell to Zhang Chaofeng, Xu San once again walked onto the street with a lantern, hearing firecrackers going off at the end of the street, crackling and punctuating the atmosphere of this cold Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>The street was quiet; for every person laughing, there were nine sighing. Xu San lowered his head, avoiding stepping into the puddles of melting snow, thinking about how he could turn around his "fate" this year. He also knew that the path to survival was narrow, and that the doors to production and life were closed. Like many others, when he heard about some commander and some commander fighting, he was happy to pay attention to which hero killed the most people. He believed that the coming of the great flood was the will of heaven. He believed that the Japanese attack on Shanhaiguan was predetermined in the "Book of Yin and Yang" five hundred years ago. He believed that everything was destined. But he hoped that he was not destined to be so poor for so long.</p>
<p>He only stretched his neck out when his foot stepped into the gambling house. The atmosphere outside the door was desolate, while inside the door it was lively and noisy. Many people's shadows flickered on the wall, and many voices wove into a swarming vortex.</p>
<p>Su Ba sat on the carpet in his original position. Everyone chatted leisurely, and the light of the opium lamp was a little brighter.</p>
<p>Putting the candy next to the opium tray, listening to Zhao, the accountant, taking his mouth away from the opium pipe and saying "Thank you," Xu San sat behind Su Ba. Putting down the paper bag, Mr. Cao continued the topic from just now, saying,</p>
<p>"Our Guangdong security donation can't be considered small, how come they want to add three strings of cash?"</p>
<p>Su Ba said, "Isn't it because they're jealous? The heat is here with us. One gambling session has to give fifteen strings of cash a day, which is five dollars. One hundred and fifty dollars a month is considered good enough for the Public Security Bureau. It's not a good thing to keep adding like this."</p>
<p>Mr. Cao, with the pipe in his mouth, invited them to take some as well, and everyone agreed, but didn't move.</p>
<p>Changfa, holding his bent knees, said, "The gambling in Hebei Street has reached eighteen strings a day, six dollars!"</p>
<p>Zhao, the accountant, exhaling thick gray smoke from his nostrils and mouth, put down his opium pipe, leaned up, took a sip of tea, picked up a small piece of silver, and said slowly in the light,</p>
<p>"The lamp donation is going to add half a dollar per lamp again, the yamen has been set up again."</p>
<p>"Last time they said they were banning it, alright, three dollars per lamp," Su Ba said, "Now they've officially set up a yamen, so to speak, business is even more difficult."</p>
<p>Xu San didn't say anything, listening to them, thinking about whether he could add two copper coins to the price of opium after the lamp donation increased.</p>
<p>"Who doesn't say that? Now many families are preparing their own. Even stores like Tongtai prepare their own when they invite someone to..." Zhao, the accountant, fell back onto the bed after the last syllable.</p>

<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists (39) (Continued from yesterday)</h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(10) (6) "Fragrant Grass Beauty" Director Chen Kangran (End)</p>
<p>"After 'Exhibition', what film are you directing now?"</p>
<p>"The film that has already started shooting is 'Woman's Enemy' (title tentative), starring Xu Qinfang, Gao Qianping, and Sun Min. It writes about the pain of women, and also about the crimes of officials. It can probably be finished in March or April."</p>
<p>"What I want to ask now," I said, "is what are your opinions on foreign films?"</p>
<p>"This..." He thought for a long time, remaining silent. Afterwards, he said:</p>
<p>"I think, regarding this point, let me have an opportunity to write it out in writing. I feel like I can't say it all at once right now."</p>
<p>"Alright." I said again, "Then please share some opinions on Chinese films."</p>
<p>He thought for a while again, and then said very carefully:</p>
<p>"Chinese films that can satisfy people are indeed too few, but the path we are currently taking is very correct and obvious. The general audience does not need mythological films or costume dramas. If we are forced to go back to that path, then it will be the decline of Chinese films. Of course, I am not saying that costume dramas should never be filmed. As long as the acting skills are good, they still have a historical meaning. But I personally have never filmed costume dramas, and I will never film that kind of film in the future, just like when I filmed martial arts films in the past. As I said before, it was purely due to capital and starting from a business standpoint. Now the audience is already asking for films that fit their lives and emotions, why should we run backwards?"</p>
<p>"As for us directors, we are under double pressure. It goes without saying about the concessions. We are not allowed to speak, not allowed to express ourselves freely, this is known to everyone. Therefore, we always feel very pitiful about what we express in our works. However, even so, I still hope that film critics will give me strict guidance."</p>
<p>"In addition, what kind of films do you personally think are needed at the moment?"</p>
<p>"I think children's education is the most important. The educational level of Chinese citizens is too low, so we should focus on rural education."</p>
<p>"…………………………"</p>
<p>"Then do you have a side business besides film? How is your daily life?"</p>
<p>"No side business, I often read books and watch movies."</p>
<p>"Don't you write scripts yourself?"</p>
<p>"I used to write, but I don't write anymore."</p>
<p>After that, we talked casually again. I then excused myself and left. (End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Fleeting Years"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨丨Beijing Screening丨丨</p>
<p>First, I must affirm that this is the most technically perfect work of Tianyi Company.</p>
<p>Although I have never read Zhang Henshui's novel, and I don't know what the original work of "Fleeting Years" is like, in the movie, the sketches of student life are very realistic and vivid in some places. For example, Huang Xishi buys a few candies, carefully puts them in a basin, wraps the teapot in a scarf, and sweeps the garbage in the room and hides it under the bed; these are all unique characteristics of students, especially for waiting for the arrival of a lover, that pure and kind meticulousness of pleasing the lover, are all depicted very delicately in the movie. In addition, there are also passing notes in the classroom, Qiu Jiusi and his like playing finger-guessing games, and singing Peking opera. These are all used by the director as gimmicks, but precisely because of this, they feel lively and real.</p>
<p>I don't care if the original work is so wonderful, but the director Gao Lihen has indeed achieved something valuable in these places. Regarding him, we have seen his "Oppression" (produced by Star) before. In "Oppression", we did not see any special achievements in the director's techniques, but on the contrary, in this "Fleeting Years", he showed his special success.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned scenes, we might as well talk about the overall aspect. At least we can't find any unreasonable Montage methods. This includes the composition of the picture and the editing of the scenes. Because of his own understanding of student life, because of his experience of petty-bourgeois life, because he is also a figure who escaped from the remnants of feudalism into this transitional era, he created this "Fleeting Years" which is quite close to a realistic portrayal of real life based on his own experience. What is most noteworthy is his grasp of the mood. This should be the most difficult subject in film creation. However, the melancholic and sad, cold tone in "Fleeting Years" is indeed very touching. Based on my own experience, this kind of grasp of atmosphere is not easy to achieve in any department of art. In the movie, Von Stroheim's "Queen Kelly" is undoubtedly the most successful in this aspect. Compared with it, "Fleeting Years" is naturally far inferior, but it is already enough to be touching, especially for our petty-bourgeois group.</p>
<p>Now we might as well list a few more minor points. The good aspects include:</p>
<p>(1) Dissolve of smoke, tea, wine, etc.</p>
<p>(2) The picture of reeds at the beginning is very beautiful. Here, it reminds us of Bai Juyi's poem "Maple leaves and reed flowers rustle in the autumn." If this wonderful poetic meaning can be fully expressed on the screen, how tasteful would that be! Although the director does not have the courage to describe it like this, it is still quite wonderful.</p>
<p>Other insufficient aspects include:</p>
<p>(1) The characters outside Beijing's Qianmen are stiff. This is naturally because it was not filmed in Beijing. But if the director is good at being clever, he can use models instead of photos. If you don't need the characters to come down, isn't it easy to hide?</p>
<p>(2) Many explanatory subtitles can be omitted, such as "The next day at dawn, he got up to sweep the room, waiting for Bai Xingsu to arrive." This is as redundant as "Lonely and desolate night" and "When the lights are bright and the wine is green" in "A Female Star."</p>
<p>(3) Sensual scenes should be strictly criticized.</p>
<p>The above are all about technical reviews. As for the evaluation of the content, the mandarin duck butterfly school is always the mandarin duck butterfly school. Of course, I am not saying that this kind of preaching to young people and teaching that feudal old man to invest in founding a free elementary school is so undesirable, but it is still just a more progressive thing in the mandarin duck butterfly school. As for what we see, it is still behind the times.</p>
<h3>Review of "Girl Without a Room"</h3>
<p>— Ya Fu</p>
<p>丨Great Light丨</p>
<p>The translated names of foreign films now are really full of strange things. This is not only very far from the original name, but even talking about these four Chinese characters of "Sentimental Lover," it is too vulgar.</p>
<p>Regarding this film, it is obvious that the theme is the ridicule of futurism by realists. Tom is an old realist painter who, after coming to Paris from the United States, is surrounded by new artists, including Russian royalty refugees who have been attacked by revolutionary forces, and wandering musicians and painters. As a result, Tom is influenced by the life and thoughts of this group of artists, and also goes with the flow and becomes a futurist painter. But his works are not understood by the so-called new painters, and some reviewers hang his paintings upside down. From then on, Tom despised this group of so-called artists, but for the sake of eating and selling his paintings for money, he finally gave up his own views and mingled with this group.</p>
<p>From the author's point of view, he is very sorry for the fate of realism. According to his explanation, new art, due to expressionism, constructivism, and even futurism, has become a school, almost forming a trend, and young realists have become incomprehensible followers in order to follow the trend. This seems to be a very shameful phenomenon. But artists still have to eat. Since they cannot change this trend, they have to be assimilated by this trend, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>We know that the emergence of futurism, judging from the initial declaration in 1909, it pushed art from the passivity of the decadent school to omnipotent power, from symbolism to reality, from the past to the future. It is this arrogant abandonment of past art and the pursuit of future art. What they describe are the speeding of cars, the noise of machines in factories, the roar of airplanes, the brilliance of iron bridges, the black smoke of warships, etc. All mechanical materials have become the objects of their art. From this point of view, the emergence of futurism is entirely the praise of and praise for capitalism. In terms of its positive aspects, it naturally abandons all corrupt and decadent things, and praises everything most progressive and most characteristic in the current society. But in the current situation where everything in capitalism is collapsing, what will their inevitable future be? They will have nothing to express, perhaps the final expression in painting will only be black squares.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Five-Year Plan after the Soviet Revolution, there were also futurist paintings praising industry. Therefore, we know that futurism is indeed the most cutting-edge art that reflects the times. Precisely because of this, their progress can become preachers of peace for a new civilization, or they can become revolutionaries for the construction of a new society, and they can also become fascists who are struggling in the old society.</p>
<p>Of course, in this film, the author completely explains and analyzes from the old point of view. He only stubbornly adheres to the existence of old naturalism and ridicules the popular futurism. However, he cannot eliminate the existence of this school, and on the contrary, regrets the demise of realism.</p>
<p>That's right, the author is in an impossible situation. Since he cannot attack head-on, he can only make light-hearted ridicule. Therefore, he not only has the contrast of paintings, but also makes full use of the mockery in their personality or life. The irrationality of the exiles, the decay or slowness of their lives, even more forcefully writes about that group of blind and ignorant appreciators and critics.</p>
<p>He uses a very bright and lively tone, which is naturally very suitable for satire. However, this is by no means an unreasonable disturbance or teasing of a comedy. We don't have to make a special close-up of a fake moon at the beginning to discover his cleverness, let's give another example; if we make a close-up of a landscape painting, we must think it is an outdoor scene, wait a moment, sign Tom's name in the corner, and then move the camera back, so we know that it is a realist oil painting, and the painter's name is Tom, and the protagonist is immediately introduced.</p>
<p>From this we can see that the director Ralph Murphy's technique is indeed very commendable. However, this is by no means a great work, we only feel this lively and delicate animal.</p>
<p>The actors are all acceptable, but Charles Ford is not as profound and moving as in the silent film era.</p>

She tried to hide her feelings, pretending to ask, "What does he look like?" Ipa said, "The Spanish envoy is very young and handsome, and also very extravagant with money. The noble ladies in the court are all infatuated with him." Christina said, "So quickly?" After she finished speaking, an usher came in and said that the Minister of Finance was requesting an audience with Her Majesty. Hearing this, Christina felt the situation become even more tense. She knew that the Minister of Finance, Magnus, was not to be trifled with. He was the most cunning and treacherous minister in the court. Although she herself had no fear of him, it was no longer just her own matter, but concerned the safety and security of another person, so she had to be very careful. After thinking for a moment, she instructed the usher to tell him to wait a while before seeing him. The usher withdrew.</p>
<p>When Christina entered the grand hall, the Minister of Finance, Magnus, immediately turned around. He looked at the Queen wearing the national court dress, which made her appear even more dignified and beautiful, and revealed his admiration. He bent down and kissed the back of the Queen's hand, but the Queen's hand suddenly withdrew. She said that she could not delay any longer, and still had to have an audience with the ministers. Magnus said, "Your Majesty has been away for five days. Where did Your Majesty go? All the ministers in the court are baffled. Did Your Majesty go to Sara?" Christina said, "Perhaps." Magnus said, "But you didn't actually go, because we sent people to look for you." Christina said, "Then I'm fortunate that I didn't go." Magnus's eyes were fixed on the Queen as he asked, "Then why did Your Majesty leave?" Christina said, "To get away for a few days." Magnus said, "To leave me?" Christina said, "To leave all of you a little. You are forcing me to agree. That's why I left to think quietly." Magnus said, "Then have you finished thinking?" Christina said, "I have finished thinking."</p>
