<p>時評</p>
<h3>故宮盜寳案亟應嚴辦</h3>
<p>閧傳中外之故宮盜寳舞弊案。早經法院偵察完畢。提起公訴。而被告易培基李宗侗等。始終抗不到案。情弊顯然。百口莫辨。夫易氏等以國家大員身份。監守自盜。已屬罪無可逭。而况乘華北緊急之秋。趁火打刦。尤無輕恕餘地。</p>
<p>故宮遺寳原爲先民精力之所寄。或則有助於學術之研討。或則有益於史實之考證。以數千百年來愼重庋藏之精華。不毁於水炎。不壞於刀兵。而獨爲少數人盜賣侵占。化爲烏有。其影響於國家文化者爲何如。戕賊及民族精神者爲何如。是以言易氏等罪狀。實有什百倍於掘人祖墓而盜竊寳藏者。政府新近對於結夥三人以上執持槍械之盜墓匪犯。且加重刑罰。判處死刑。以盜墓爲常業者。亦處無期徒刑。而易氏等托庇於租界及外國法權之下。反得優遊歲月。逍遙自若。此而不予嚴究。將何以肅國家之紀綱而爲當世法哉。</p>
<p>易氏等初經高等法院之能緝。監察院之彈劾。繼有江寗地方法院之起訴。中政會之澈查。以至最近中央古物保管會之查辦。苟無盜賣情弊早可挺身而出。對簿公庭。以自表其清白。乃竟不此之圖。已見其情虚矣。而况退一步言。若輩果因一時之私慾冒此不韙。事後而能畏罪自白。返還贓物。則朝野人士或猶願在萬無可恕之中予以一線自新之路。而利令智昏。復絕不出此。案發之後。惟知利用租界及外國法權。與夫刑訴法中不得爲缺席判决之規定。抗不應傳。以期延緩其罪狀之宣判。最近易氏本人又以潛逃僞滿聞。其居心之險惡。乃益昭然若揭矣。</p>
<p>吾人又聞被盜古物中之一部分。早經運往法國。秘密出售。然因事機不密。功敗垂成。該項古物在馬賽海關發覺後。迄今扣留未放。十月下旬南北各報皆傳前北平農業試騐塲長蕭瑜實主其事。而蕭氏則於近日報端連發啟事。堅决否認。自矢靡他。接蕭氏曾與易培基共犯呑没公欵之罪。有江寗地方法院起訴案中。與易同爲被告之一。雖在該時未聞有與易氏謀盜寳之說。其與易氏關係之密切。要無疑義。至於古物在法被扣。固爲事實中央古物保管會且獲有確據多件。水落石出。當不在遠。惟在眞相未明之前。吾人尙不願有所論列耳關於盜寳一案。今有蕭襄沛劉光鍔二人被逮歸案。所望於中央者。惟在採取迅速有效方法。將該案之主要人犯。一律加以逮捕　毌使漏網。其有匿跡租界或竄往國外者。應卽交涉引渡。治以應得之罪。蕭瑜旣有嫌疑。復爲呑没公欵案被告之一。亦不應輕予於過也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）據美國報紙載稱、該國國務院現方草擬一種英美兩國海軍恊定之計畫、關於此事、英國消息靈通人士聲明、並未接得華盛頓正式消息足證此訊係屬確實、且任何雙方海軍恊定草案、或成立聯合陣綫計畫、决非英國所能贊成、蓋倫敦海軍談話之目標、原係研究一般海軍條約、能否延長、或予修改、故英國在海軍方面所努力者、僅爲訂立一般恊定而已、其他非所知也云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據每日郵報載稱、英國政府現擬重行設法、務使各海軍國代表於明年春間、仍在倫敦集合討論、據英國方面意見、日前所企圖之目的、乃在對於未來監察海軍軍備之一事、獲得各國所同意之方式、英國主張一切海軍造艦計劃、均須公開宣佈、現仍維持原來立塲、惟外相西門現在法國加納城消渡聖誕令節、日本駐英大使松平、俟其返國後、卽將加以訪問、有所商談云、（二十四日合瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）晨報載稱、自日本宣告廢止華盛頓海軍條約之消息證實之後、華盛頓與倫敦之間、立卽交換意見、美國駐英大使賓漢、現已歸國、當其抵華盛頓時、卽與國務卿赫爾商談兩點之久、美國政府亦卽於昨日午後將該國在未來談判中、所當採取之政策大綱、明白表示、計分六點、（一）採取愼重態度、以免刺激日本國家主義思想、（二）對於遠東一切問題、英美兩國密切合作、（三）此項合作、亦當用以抵抗日本關於海軍之平等要求、（四）美國建造軍艦、俾海軍實力能達到現行海軍條約所許可之限度、（五）英美兩國關於合作之談判所可得到之結果、無論對於報界、或對於民衆、均保持緘默態度、（六）繼續與日本進行外交談判、尋覓一種方式、俾現行五·五·三比率、仍得以保持云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日報外省版登載名記者聖蒲里士所作關於華盛頓海軍條約之一文、謂華盛頓海約如繼續存在則依照該約所規定之比率英美兩國每年可建造海軍九萬噸、日本可建造五萬五千號、法國意大利各可建造四萬噸、英國海軍旣已降低至其所不可缺少之最少限度以下、今乃對於各國普遍减低海軍噸數、獨不能加以接受其態度殊足怪矣、該文結論則謂、如列强政治的競爭不歸於消失、則一切關於軍備問題之交涉、均不易產生結果、華盛頓條約之失敗與倫敦海軍談判之流產、其故莫不在此、所望因此獲得敎訓、知以政治問題爲重則庶幾乎其可云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美元貶値問題</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）參議員湯默斯今日與美聯社談話、聲稱美元减値問題、將爲下屆國會中最重要之爭點、惟政府方面反對再行减値之勢力亦漸形發展、據稱財部及聯邦凖備部現正草擬法案、以鞏固對於聯邦凖備制之政治的控制、此舉亦將使政府對於銀行放欵之政治的控制更進一步、若干専家以爲政府因此卽可提高物價抑低幣價、而减輕國債云、（廿三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統及新政派議員决定反對通貨膨脹及軍人津貼案、但對工會要求之每週三十小時工制案則將表示妥恊、據稱羅總統業已拒絕津貼案、並非正式表示反對繼續通貨膨脹、美國退伍軍人恊會長貝爾格倫諾宣稱、國會開會時、彼將提陳津貼案、估計立卽發付退伍軍人津貼券約現金二、○○○、○○○、○○○元至二○○、○○○、○○○元間、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本對「满」鐵道政策</h3>
<p>北黑成功圖寗開車</p>
<p>另又設密林等三路</p>
<p>蘇聯亦以鐵路政策對付</p>
<p>南滿路公司擔任直接指導、對「滿」鐵道政策、自去年以來、卽逐漸實施、到現在收得成果的、有兩條最主要的路綫、</p>
<p>（一）呼海鐵路的北端、丨由北安鎭經辰清·璦琿·直達大黑河的鐵路、已於十二月十四日完成、其軌道鋪設工作、并於當日開始第一次全綫試車、</p>
<p>（二）吉會鐵路的圖門江岸起點·經梨樹溝·寗安·穿過中東路牡丹江·到寗北的一綫、也漸次完成、現在已開始臨時營業、</p>
<p>北黑路是呼海路和齊洮·四洮·兩路的延長、單就經濟關係而論、他今後將完全掌握著黑龍江平原的出產、無論農產與林產、都爲該路所吸收、在此路未通之前、如在夏季從哈爾濱乘船到大黑河要走一星期、今後祇須二十點鐘的工夫、而且還可以經哈爾濱與拉法鐵道、與吉會路接軌、由北朝鮮的清津出海、比經南滿路到大連、又近便、又敏捷、更越過中東路的一部分利益、</p>
<p>在軍事上大家都認識大黑河·面臨黑龍江、後憑小興安嶺、是將來日蘇軍事上的重點、在日本方面、如果讓赤軍從這裏渡江、越過小興安嶺、則黑龍江全省不保、「北滿」不免爲人所掌握、反是日本如果由大黑河渡江、扼往了海蘭泡·截斷海參崴與赤塔間的聯絡、則沿海省一帶、以及北部庫頁島、都在日本掌握之中、所以他積極完成這條鐵路、在萬一發生事變的時候、一方面由南滿鐵路轉四洮路·齊洮路·與大黑河取聯絡、另一方面從清津上岸、經敦化·拉法·哈爾濱·呼蘭·而北上、觀此則這條路的關係、是何等重大啊、</p>
<p>圖門江岸到寗北、路長雖不過二百五十公里、但他所經過的地方、都是「滿洲」東部的富庶區域就現在這種未經開發的狀况、沿綫的積貨丨榖類及林產物品丨、也有十萬噸以上、所以這是朝鮮北部新開諸港的培養路綫、將來下式開通之後、那邊的土地、跟着開發起來、其經濟的利益、何止今日的十倍、况且這條路、不久就會延長到依蘭、丨日本對「滿」移民的中心區域、松花江沿岸的農業生產、又吸入該路的懷裏、以前中東路的任務、恐怕他要分去一半、而日本移民的便利、也將從此更見增加、交通便利以後、或者移植過去的農民、不致再逃歸日本了、其軍事的意義、縱不及北黑路那樣大、而剪斷中東路、扼制吉東的作用、也並不小、</p>
<p>今年十二月又計劃投資四千萬日金、要着手建築密山到林口·索倫到突泉·日平街到四安縣、（遼寗屬、舊名大疙塔）這三條路、後一條在經濟上是有相當意義、軍事的聯絡、不見到十分重大、可是前兩綫·密山是吉東的重鎭、索倫是大臖安嶺南面的要點、這樣的佈置、不但有消極的防禦意味、特别是索倫突泉路、當然要和四洮路接軌、其伸入外蒙、又在意想中、因此蘇聯方面、雖願出售中理路、冀換和平、但他也曉得並不可靠、同時日本急進的輿論、又主張蘇聯欲求和平、必須退出東西比利亞·及外蒙古、由日本支配、以免衝突、蘇聯於此、自必注意警戒、所以在他的第二五年計劃之外、有以下的重要鐵路計劃、（一）建築新西比利亞横斷鐵道、以備西比利亞鐵道東部路綫不能時候的第二輸送路綫、（二）西比利亞大鐵道、原爲單綫路軌、現時非但不能擔促進其全國工業化的任務、在軍事上尤其不便、所以今後都要敷設複綫路軌、以便往還、（三）凡與「滿洲」北部接壤地帶、因鑑於日本鐵道政策的積極、於是在蘇境内建設細密的鐵道網、不用講、鐵道網是以軍事爲重的、由他們雙方的鐵道政策看、其戰時凖備、還是很積極啊、（十二月十八日於大連）</p>
<h3>戰區治安問題</h3>
<p>匪患急須肅清</p>
<p>北平通信、戰區治安問題、迄未解决、癥結所在、厥有二端、（一）新編保安隊之人數及槍枝之爭執、（二）保安隊之整頓及清剿殘匪問題、現在戰區之保安隊、係於收復戰區之際、臨時編制及臨時收編者、指揮之不能統一、編練之未經完善、乃無可諱言之事實、加以實力不足、不史大舉清鄕、是以枝節横生、事端迭起、非加整頓並增厚實力、肅清殘匪、堵塞各口、以清亂源、則戰區治安、無法談到、當局有鑒於此、一面訓練新保安隊、一面規定正本清源辦法、顧日人對於此事、多方挑剔、迄未實現、戰區以内駐紥保安隊之人數、依照塘沽恊定、可至九千、所携武器、亦無限制、乃日方不顧該恊定、始終堅持人數不得過六千、武器除步槍外、生砲固不必談、機關槍亦阻止携帶、馴致新編保安隊不能開入戰區、而治安問題、亦無從解决、日來玉田保安隊與民團衝突又起、地方復遭蹂躪、當局亟謀澈底解决、以期一勞永逸、一面對於團隊之糾紛、作治標之調處、一面與日方切實交涉、做治本之工作、戰區清理委員會方面、刻正努力進行、已由朱式勤·殷同·殷汝耕等、與日使館武官柴山接洽、前日已作一度會議、尙無相當結果、昨日朱式勤由平赴津、謁見于學忠、接洽一切、玉田方面團隊兩方、仍在對峙中、形勢嚴重、亟待解决、朱氏在津與于商得結果後、卽轉唐山前往玉田、先謀將目前之糾紛、暫作一結束、根本問題、再在平與日方代表謀一正當解决辦法、柴山昨日赴津、接洽某項問題、今日下午六時、偕同由長春轉道西來之日外省専員吉田及一到平、有所接洽、</p>

<h3>平市施行標準價格</h3>
<p>試辦經過成績甚佳</p>
<p>商塲惡習可告消除</p>
<p>北平能信、北平市政府、最近爲謀平市商業日趨繁榮起見、對於各商舖要價還價惡習、已决定痛予革除、其初步改革辦法、爲施行標凖市價、於本月一日起、先試辦東安市塲、結果甚佳、並於本月十六日起、推行於西單商塲、茲悉明年元旦起、全市商舖將一致劃一市價、茲將施行上經過、及其利益、詳誌於次、</p>
<p>施行之動機　平市各商號、對門市交易、在十年以前、尙奉行「言不二價」之美德、間有出入者、爲數亦少、且亦祗限於擺攤一類、蓋小本經營、祗求脫貨、以便週轉、個中苦况、凡老練世故者、罔不習知、因是每有使顧主感覺到有「吃虧」「便宜」之分、換言之、不怕費功夫、討價還價、一而至於再三者、卽能佔得便宜、假設老老實實、要價照付、則决無不吃虧之理、最近數年來、因市面不振、商舖無論、</p>
<p>大小、因謀掙扎、在對付不賠本原則之下、企圖「搶生意」、於是所謂「賤賣」之風大熾、祗要有人進門照顧、舞論如何、决不願使其空手而出、你攬我奪、當年言不二價之商人道德、於焉打破無遺、市當局認爲如此「商戰」不僅影響市面繁榮、且於商人道德、勢將愈况愈下、益以某聞人在東安市塲售買古磁瓶、致受人愚、遂不得不講究挽救辦法、東安市塲首先施行標凖價格、其動機在此、結果成績極佳、</p>
<p>標準價成績　標凖價格之核訂、表面上年去、似甚困難、而各商號能否切實奉行、當時頗爲一般人所注意、其實施辦法、係由各商號推出代表組織評價委員會、依據進貨賬單、逐件訂價、一經評定標明、卽不得任意抬高或抑價出售、而各商人因感覺以往虚僞號召主顧之苦痛、亦均認爲非此法不足言維持現狀、故東安市塲施行標凖市價結果、業務均見起色、往日僅有二分利息之貨、現均可坐售三分或四分不等、甲店旣不需要大减價、乙舖亦不必大犧牲、而素無標凖價之古董攤、現亦不打折扣、劃一不二、據往日東安市塲全塲門沽、平均每日約有三萬、四千餘元、自施行標凖價格後、平均每日可增至五萬一千餘元、西單商塲自本月十六日起施行以來、各商業務、亦見起色、</p>
<p>繁榮根本策　據北平市社會局長蔡元表示、平市係故都名地、文化建設之偉大、甲於環球、每年來平觀光之各國大小旅行團、無慮百數十起、個人遊覽、無從僕數、彼等來平遊覽時、恒購辦大宗物品歸國、以誌紀念、商人如以不誠實態度臨之、在勢必影響及整個商業之興衰、袁市長有鑒於此、諭令本局釐定施行標凖市價辦法、一方使顧客免去懷疑及討價還價之煩、另一方面、可令商人應有之利益、不致受虚僞賤賣與贈品之犧牲、市府對北平建設文化遊覽區、現已積極計劃中、將來建設成功、各國旅行團來平觀光時、必可得有賓到如歸之感、則故都復興、庶其有豸云云、（二十二日）</p>

<h3>銀行界獻策請財部獎勵銀進口</h3>
<p>運回時發還原稅或將來免徵</p>
<p>外商銀行曾要求財部允考慮</p>
<p>財孔聲明决不使通貨澎漲</p>
<p>新聲社云、滬市銀根奇緊、錢業市塲所開之注拆、已漲至四角、其原因爲農產品秋收及年終結帳關係、以致存銀缺乏、財政部對於偷運、除由海關嚴緝外、頒佈獎罰辦法、嚴令各省曁各業恊助之、其成效雖著、但非治本辦法、新聲社記者、昨向滬銀行界探悉、銀行領袖張公權·陳光甫·等、曾謁財政部長孔祥熙、貢獻獎勵銀進口策、因我國白銀、祇有出口、而無進口、雖則出口已大减、但長此以往、將來我國白銀、不免逐漸减少、希望政府設法獎勵銀出口、但銀行界意見所及、例如已出口之銀運回時、憑海關當時出口之稅單、發還所徵之銀稅及平衡稅、或於運回之銀、將來再出口時、免徵出口稅及平衡稅、同時鑒於市面謠傳通貨澎漲、請財孔明白宣示、以釋羣疑而安人心、當時孔部長對於獎勵銀進口、允加考慮、惟對於通貨澎漲、極力闢謠、並鄭重聲明、本人在職一日、决不使通貨澎漲、减低銀幣成色、發行不兌換鈔票、更屬無稽、聞外商銀行、如匯豐·麥加利等、曾要求我財政部、對於已徵出口銀稅及平衡稅之銀、運回後、將來再出口時、不再徵稅、此項問題、財部正在攷慮中、如果准之、則匯豐等外商銀行前運往香港等地之銀、將運回調劑金融、因外商銀行運出口者、爲數甚鉅、以致庫存單薄、萬一發生擠提風潮、應付頗覺困難、故爲預防計、亦願將已出口之銀運回云、</p>

<p>長江水淺尤以蕪湖黑沙洲（卽浜子磯附近三北松浦擱淺處）一帶爲甚、該處水勢祇有七八尺、凡吃水較重之輪、難以通過、蕪關已頒布過儎駁運、維持航道辦法、詎料三北公司松浦輪、甫經拖救出淺、而清浦號輪、此次由滬上水、二十三日行抵該處江面、又因水淺遭擱、查清浦吃水在十一尺以上、與該處水尺、相差尙巨、故雖令長江上下水船拖曳、殊難奏效、現擬將清浦輪中貨件駁出、然後拖救、其他各江輪行至該處、亦凖備駁儎轉運、以免擱阻云、</p>

<h3>潘仰堯談一年來各業營業狀况</h3>
<p>銀錢業多投資農村</p>
<p>國貨業亦日見發達</p>
<p>中央社記者、爲明瞭一年來本市各業營業狀况起見、昨特往訪熟悉本市各業情形之潘仰堯君、詢以各業情形、據潘君對記者表示、本年銀錢業國貨業等均有明顯之進步、茲分誌如次、</p>
<p>銀錢業　據潘君談、銀錢業一年來營業狀况、除資本較短之行家外、餘均有盈餘、本年内市上雖有數家小銀行倒閉、但此不足謂本市銀錢業之衰落、蓋資本短少之銀行、週轉不能靈活、且其所營大部份爲投機事業、其内部組織、又缺乏健全、因之倒閉、與整個銀錢業本身無關、本年内各銀行當局、鑒於規銀集中都市之危險、均已從事於農村借貸、統計全市各銀行投資於各地農村借貸者、數達一千萬以上、是項借欵、利息雖薄、手續雖繁、但農村借戶、皆重信用、放出之欵、均能如期收回、所以各銀行認爲投資農村借貸、係一種健全鞏固之營業、樂於經營、各大銀行現正從事於各地農村調查、俾便明年度投資數量增加、蓋依照財部所頒佈之銀行儲蓄法規定、投資農村借欵數目、當占儲欵中五分之一、而本年内各銀行投資總數僅一千萬元、與行儲蓄法所規定、相差至鉅、故决定明年起、積極投資各地農村借欵、至於各地農村金融、除因災欠收者外、其餘均豐收、而陜西棉收達五千萬元、許昌菸葉收穫達四千萬元以上、尤爲歷年所僅見、農村金融寬裕、明年放欵、勢必因之大增、可斷言也、各銀行直接間接積極投資内地、實屬一種良好現象云、</p>
<p>紗廠業　至於紗廠業、本年内營業狀况、雖無進步、但各紗廠當局、因鑒於該業之奄奄無生氣、均積極謀改良辦法、榮宗敬氏、前赴西北考察回來、現已着手組織棉紗業改進會、以資商討改善辦法、纱廠業衰落原因、一由於資本短少、貨欵利重、蓋紗廠家所貨之欵、利息恒在一分或九厘之問、而日紗廠所貨之欵、利息僅二三厘許、以此相衡、相差之鉅可見、至於二十支紗每包開支、我國須二十六元以上、而日紗則僅十八元許、紗廠管理、又不及日廠之優良、例如我國紗廠、每萬枚紗錠、向須工人四百人管理、茲加改良、亦須工人三百人、日廠則僅一百八十人、以此種種、所以不能與日紗相競、營業日見衰落、本年内紗廠營業、亦有數家有盈餘、各廠當局現已努力改進、所以明年起頗有希望、麵粉業營業、在上半年均有盈餘、下半年平常、</p>
<p>國貨業　國貨業本年狀况、以機器及電器業爲最佳、該兩業之發達、係屬一種自然趨勢、預料將來益形發展、以内地樂於購用、如電燈·電扇·農作·用具·等、均已大事購備、所以該兩業大有盈餘、其發展原因、雖由於此、但大貨機器入口稅之增加、及機器原料入口稅之退减、亦屬不大原因、綢緞業本年營業、雖較去年進步、但利薄已年不如年、搪瓷業營業亦發達、但賣價恒在成本之下、現正商謀辦法、以資維持、染織業、則染業盈餘、而織業不振、至於小工業如热水瓶業·電木業·等、均以　製濫造、廠家倒閉者纍纍、殊可捥惜、橡膠業亦因同業競爭過甚、幾如强弩之末、工業界應加以注意云、</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任敎平視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>在賈多才想着、根據了遊歷周陵這一點，一定要談到西北的狀况了。不想那威廉先生又轉了一個話鋒，看到桌上的洋裝書，燙了中國金字，他就笑道：中國的字，這樣寫在書上，也是很美麗的。說時，用那套滿了金黃色汗毛的手指，指着洋裝書。這樣說着，賈多才更有些莫明其妙了，這樣的談話、簡直是中國官塲見面，今天天氣很好的那種說法、這二人究爲了什麽來的，倒有些猜不透。也是那威廉自己、看出說的話，有些近於無聊了，這就放了一點鄭重的樣子，同那趙國富咕嚕了一陣。由面色和眼神上看去，行道這漸漸的談上正題了。於是也鎭定了精神，聽他們的話因。趙國富轉過臉來，先呌了一聲買先生，這才接着道：我們這兩位德國先生，是在中國經理德國汽車的，在西北各省推銷得很多。賈先生不是代表貴銀行在西北辦理經濟合作的事麽？譬如收買糧食棉花之類，總也得有汽車運輸，假如要買汽車的話，我們的車子，可以打個八折賣給你們。聽到這種，賈多才李士廉都明白了，閙了半天，原來是兜攬生意買賣的，並不是來拜訪學者，更不是考察西北情形，賈多才這番鄭重佈置，小題大做，總算是白忙了。把兩個賣汽車的，這樣掃榻以待，雖是没有人知道，也究竟心裏慚愧，他不是月英這樣的窮人，害臊是很自由的，他内疚神明，可也就把兩張臉腮，臊得通紅起來了。（九八）</p>
<h3>藝術與生活</h3>
<p>— 馬佛生</p>
<p>趙之謙，字撝叔；他的金石書畫是近百年來的權威，近人祗安吉吳倉老堪與匹敵，因爲他是以眞實的功夫，和力量見長的！自然一般専事取巧，没有眞功夫的所謂藝術家，那里可以望其項背呢？他是紹興城内大坊口人，他有一個親戚，從前在我們家裏帮過幾天短工，我們要求伊講撝叔的故事，據伊說：撝叔本來是做過一任知縣，他的金石書畫祗是心之所愛，並不賣錢，所以他的作品很少，那時候眞可說是：「爲藝術而藝術。」後來因爲不慣官僚奉迎，就回到家裏不再做官，（他自己刻有「不爲五斗米折腰」的印章）但是：他家裏很窮，就祗能藉此生活；一變而爲「爲生活而藝術」了。不過他雖然如此，仍舊不肯見錢就做，一定要等到他的夫人無米爲炊的時候；方肯動手，倘有得意之作，還要自己留着賞玩，不肯給人。後來他家裏遭着一次火災，將所藏精品都燒掉，所以他的作品，流傳愈少了。我想想一代宗匠的大藝術家，尙且爲生活所迫，不能堅持他的「爲藝術而藝術」的宗旨，終於弄到「爲生活而藝術」，目下大呌着爲「藝術而藝術」的藝術家，或者也未必不爲生活所戰勝哩！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （邢廣益移酬助賑）</p>
<p>這個年頭，人跟着人學，大家都學機靈了，自以爲機靈，要去把别人當儍子，結果也許儍子會玩弄機靈人，多少是自作聰明，結果是聰明自誤了。</p>
<p>這就叫做「難得糊塗。」</p>
<h3>相人術</h3>
<p>— 禪塵</p>
<p>朋友中有個呌老王的，据他自己說：三敎九流，無不能曉，尤其擅長那相人之術；雖然不能比擬天罡淳風，但也可稱做鐵口半仙了，當我和他初次會面的時候，他便用驚異的眼光，注視我的面部，訝聲道：「老兄好一副面相呀！尤其是張尊嘴，大可容拳，日後必主大富，可惜···」接着便用惋惜的口吻道：「可惜足下眉間重罩晦色，近年來流年不大順利。」最後，用肯定的口氣，决然道：「三年以後，足下定能飛黃騰達，那時便知道我老王相術的靈騐了。」經他這麽一陣，當時我心裏也曾熱辣辣過一會，但便也一笑置之，不以爲意。現在距離老王替我相面的時間，足有五年了，依然飄零江湖，落魄如故，老王的相術，終究不曾靈騐。」</p>
<p>以後，我每次看他和人相面，總是這麽一個方式：起先讚頌或驚奇他的相貌。接着便惋惜他目下的不遇，最後料定他在若干年後，必主大富或大貴，於是央求他相面的人，都得到無上安慰似的欣欣然去了。</p>
<p>某次，在酒酣興烈的當兒，我便請敎他相人的秘訣，他侃侃而談道：「其實我的相人之術並没有什麽了不得的秘訣。只不過記住「驚」，「嘆」，「諾」三個字罷了，無論何人，你如果讚頌他相貌生得出衆，總没有不入耳的，所以相人的第一要訣，便是「驚」，因爲這樣才能引起人的興味。其次便是「嘆」了，不論你現在得意不得意，一個人總不知足的，我便利用了這點，去打動他的心，惋惜目下的不遇，不期而然使他自己也惋惜自己起來·那末我的相術已成功三分之二了·最後的要着，就須「諾」了·我旣然驚讚他的相貌，又嘆惜他的不遇，然後截然的允諾他在若干年後，定能大貴大富，使他得到一張美麗而遠期一兌現的支票，還使他不五體投地的欽佩我嗎？哈哈！這便是久經江湖，戳不穿的相人訣了·」</p>
<h3>擾　往年所得結果</h3>
<p>— 月</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這座狐仙塔的所在地我可記不清楚了，大槪是在奉天城内的東北角上；我希望這個回想是對的，就是錯，也不致大錯。然而我自己也承認，是不大認得方向的人，只要一到比較驀生些的地方，我便不知道那裏是東那裏是西了。何况奉天城内的街道，又是非常的曲折，根本不易辨認；如今事隔幾十年，再要追想起來，當然是不凖確的了！</p>
<p>太后出遊的意志已定，便照例有人傳出了命令去，知照大家凖備起來。第一步是必須先派人到狐仙塔去，驅逐閒人，免得驚動太后的聖駕。第二步是選定了路由，在每一條必須走過的路上，鋪好黃沙，以符法定規則。最後，就是操練慣了的一隊儀仗，依次出發。</p>
<p>我坐在轎子裏，一路去的時候，便閉上了眼睛，仔細的思索，爲什麽我以前所聽到的在别的民族中流傳着的神話，又和我們中國的神話完全不同？無論是眞是假，都應該有一個理由。可惜我想了許久，不曾理會出來；也許専門研究神話學的學者，可以很有條理的解答出來。我對於神話，一向是很注意的；但像上面太后所告訴我們的一段，却並不能引起我的特殊的注意，祇覺得非常滑稽可笑罷了！</p>
<p>整列的儀仗行走起來，總是很慢的，好在我們都没有什麽病，並不急着要去請求大仙醫治，慢些也不妨！最後，終於是到了。（二○八）</p>

<p>小常識</p>
<h3>地球的常識</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們脚踏的大地，叫做地球半球的裏面，究竟是什麽樣變成呢？簡單的說起來，好像洋葱頭的皮樣子，是一層一層搆成的，然而把地球分剖開來，大體可分爲三層，就是最外面的一層，叫做殼層，稍裏的爲中間層，再進爲核心，外殻層又可分爲數層，我們脚踏的地面，謂之西阿爾層，這層的下面，是西馬層，西阿爾層以硅素同阿爾紐姆（金屬質）而成的岩石，質，化學上所謂花崗岩與石英質岩，西馬層是硅素與馬克納秀姆（金屬質）而成的玄武岩，是帶有鹽基性的岩石，外殼層厚約千二百粁，在中間層在外殼層之下，又可分爲上下二層，上層爲克羅灰西馬層，就是由硅素，鐵，馬克納秀姆，克羅茂姆等質而成，下層爲泥灰西馬層，亦以鐵，鎳，硅素，馬克納秀姆等而成，中間層約厚千七百粁，這層是天空落下的隕石，至於中心層的核心，叫做鎳灰層，是鎳所成的，這一層有人說是剛性體，就是很硬的，也有人說是液性體，是與水質相同的，不過没有人能够鑽到地球的中心去，還不能斷定其爲什麽樣，然而照地震時的觀測，又從潮水漲落的現象研究起來，地球的中心，必定不如泥水的，大槪是剛性的硬體，形成地殼岩石的重量與地球本體的比重，是二·六七與五·二二的比率，據地質學家考察起來，西馬層爲二·八丨三四，克羅灰西馬層爲四，泥灰西馬層爲五丨六，鎳灰層爲六·二的比重，這種學說，諸位問了稍解理化知識的人就爲懂的，可是地球的内部是什麽樣分的呢？現在我們用菜刀比方把地球切開兩塊，（這是譬喻用刀切開萍果，洋葱的意思，因爲没有什麽樣大的刀，可以剖分地球的）說明一下，諸位想來聽見過醫生用愛克司光綫診察身體内臓病源的方法，這就是地質學者診察地球内部的道理是一樣的，他們雖然没有鑽到地球的裏邊去，然而從學理上研究起來，好比一個透明的玻璃球，被他們看得很明白的，就是他們學者用精密的地震計，觀測地震（地動）的方法，譬如美國舊金山發生大地震，他們就能够推算到這震動，從地球内部傳達到四方，舊金山地震後，幾點幾分，可以傳達到北京，幾分幾秒可以傳達到上海，一些不會差遲的，没有知識的人，就要說他們是神仙了。其實對於天文學研究得很精的人，是極容易的一回事，試看上海徐家匯的天文臺的天氣預報，何以預知明日會晴後天有雨呢。也是同一個道理哇。地質學家從地層上推算起來，從一表六○粁與一二○○粁之間，有岩石密度不同的差異境界點，又從地表至二九○○粁地方，其密度亦大不同，第一點的差異，爲西馬層與西阿爾屈的境界，第二點爲西馬層與中間層的境界，第三點爲中間屈與鎳灰層的境界，西阿爾層下面的西馬層，溫度甚高，壓力亦大，照普通溫度計算起來，地球的中心，有幾萬度，（地質學家計算約在五千度至六千度之間）壓力在二百萬氣壓以上，地球内部旣有這樣高溫度，那地球全體，是保有鐵的二倍的剛性，地震的波動，通過地球内部而來，地球因日月的引力，地面的水，就要起變化，成爲潮水了。由此可以推知地球内部，是富於彈力性的物質而成的。</p>

<h3>德國中學師資訓練（二）</h3>
<p>朱·鎭·蓀·</p>
<p>（二）中學師資訓練的方法</p>
<p>就德國中學師資訓練而言、敎師可分爲兩種、第一種是畢業於大學或高等専門學校中的敎授普通科目的敎師、第二種是敎授特殊科目如體育、藝術和實用藝術的敎師、這種敎師所受的訓練要比出身於大學的敎師所受的訓練較低、且就酬報和優先權而言、他們在中學裏只佔第二等地位、德國中學校中的主要勢力多爲第一種的敎師所佔有、所以、我們把這種敎師作爲我們研究的對象、</p>
<p>德國不像歐洲其他的國家、是没有國家敎育部的、德國是一個聯邦制的國家、由十六四組織而成、他們對於敎育、司法行政、和某種課稅都是有自治權的、不過他們都服從一九一九八月十一日所頒布的國家憲法的條規、但是現在所有聯邦國家的自治敎育部乃與一八七一年所成立的帝國的敎育部完全一致的、所以中學畢業證書在德國各地還是發生效力、大學的學位亦是一樣、中學敎育的課程表、學程和敎學歷程的性質因在各地都是一律、所以頗可供人做一種交換班（Ｋassenauslausch）的實騐、這種交替班的實騐、就是在德國各個不同城市（如姆尼其和漢堡）中的中學校的學生彼此可以交換受課、例如、在姆尼其城市中的文科中學或理科中學的學生可以在漢堡城市中的同樣中學校的敎師指導之下研究數星期、而漢堡城市中的學校學生同樣的亦可以到姆尼其城市中的同樣學校中去受課、這種辦法對於普通一般學生的學術上的進步不會發生偏見、因爲各個中學校中的作業程度都是十分一律的、</p>
<p>關於德國中學學敎師選擇及訓練方法、我們爲討論便利起見、最好以普魯斯爲標準、普魯斯的中學敎師的衷練乃由國家考試所規定的、這種國家考試乃包含兩部份、一、爲學位考試、二、爲敎師的考試、</p>
<p>一、學位考試、這種考試是根據一九一七年七月二十七日、一九二六年正月二日、一九二七年正月十九日、和十月十五日、以及一九三十年二月四日的普魯斯敎育部的法令而組織的、以下爲應試者必需之條件、</p>
<p>（一）中學畢業證書</p>
<p>（二）在德國大學中研究八學期、其中三學期係在普魯斯大學中研究的、</p>
<p>（三）應試者除在大學中受過主要的與次要的科目之外、還須聽講過哲學和敎育學、</p>
<p>（四）應試者須有兩學期的親自到塲參加實際體操、並受過兩學期的體育講演、</p>
<p>這種考試是由敎育部所指定之特别委員會主持的、所有的委員多屬大學中的敎授和中學敎育専家、主席一職往往由中學敎育専家充任、考試委員員的主席由法律規定有獨裁之權、請求應試者能否參加應試乃由他决定、凡應試者的條件與章程不合者他可以拒絕其請求、主席的决定只有敎育部長可以提出否决、</p>
<p>考試的科目約分爲普通的與特别的兩種、普通的科目爲哲學、特别的科目隨應試者自己指定、這特别科科目又分爲三種、兩種主要的、一種次要的、主要的科目可以從以下的幾種中選擇兩種、基督敎敎義、德文、拉丁文、希臘文、法文、英文、歷史、地理、數學、物理、化學、植物學、和動物學、次要的科目可以從下面幾種中選擇一種、哲學入門、政治學、敎育學、應用數學、地質學、鑛物學、中古與現代藝術學史、比較語言學、波蘭語、瑞士語、俄軭語、西班牙語、意大利語、土耳期語、荷蘭語、宗敎史、和中國語、</p>
<p>關於考試的方法约有兩種、即筆試與口試、筆試又发兩種、一、作論文兩篇、二、在塲考試、至於兩篇論文又有主要與次要之分、主要論文題目係從應試者的主要科目中選擇、次要的論文題目乃由次要的科目中選擇、應試者作主要論文時、可有五個月的準備、作次要的論文可有三個月的準備、倘得考試委員會主席的允可、主要論文的準備時間可增加六星期、次要的可增加四星期、倘使考試委員會認爲應試者的論文確有特殊高深之價値、那末在塲的考試他可以免試全部或其中一部分、考試的時間定爲三小時、在一九二九至一九三十年、間的考試時、在八百七十二個應試者當中有九十二個因論文有特殊的價値而被免全部的在塲筆試、</p>
<p>至於口試係另由一個委員會分開辦理、這個委員會至少包含三個人、即主席、主試者、和紀錄者、紀錄者的職務係在把應試者的答案詳細紀錄下來、每種考試的結果都以優、上、中、下、四種戺號來表明、如有科目不及格者可請坟補考、至於補考的方法係由委員會去决定、請求補考者應繳補考鄪八馬克、凡考試及格者可得中學敎師的學位、（未完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「選本」</h3>
<p>— 再靑</p>
<p>「文學」的「社談」裏，登載了一篇「論選本」的短論，說明現在選本的蕪雜，重複，希望選書的人開拓一些新路，不要儘在這狹小的圈子裏兜轉。這意見是完全對的。在「論文選」（文藝風景）一文裏，我曾經把這樣的書籍，稱作「選本的選本」。現在想起來，覺着還得加上一點說明，就是並非「更精選」的意思，而是從選本中隨意挑選，拉雜成書，根本上就没有「選」。</p>
<p>選本是一件大事，也是比個人的集子更有效果，更能不朽的。許多的文集可以失傳，好的選本，往往是不容易消滅。理由是：選本集中了各家作品的精萃成分、使讀者用很少的經濟，不多的時間，來了解更多的東西。但這樣的選本，决不是「隨意挑選，拉雜成書」的一類。所以，選本的好處是很多的，如果選家是優秀，肯把選書當作一種事業，認眞來做的話。</p>
<p>遺憾是，這樣的選家並不多，以至「投機取巧，粗製濫造」的選本，常常出現在市塲上。此買書的人，所以在選本堆裏選來選去，而終於無從選起也。造成這樣現象的原因，是不單純的，有印刷業發達的關係，有出版家生意眼的關係，也有選家生活的關係。在種種複雜的條件之下，想消滅這種現象，是不可能的。祇有從另一方面來補救，刻苦的對選本下一番批判挑選的工夫，不斷的督促和清算，這責任應該由批評家擔負起。</p>
<p>中國出版界有一種很壞的風氣，就是不肯分途發展，常常共同的咬住同一的書籍，死命的來拚，非弄到數敗俱傷不止。如「二十四史」，「二十五史」，「二十六史」，卽其一例。所以，甲出版家因一本小品文選獲得了利潤，乙也就再來一本，丙看見有點眼紅，加上一本來凑趣，這樣發展下去，勢必到家家都賣小品文，人人都買小品文，不是小品文也硬算小品文，把中國弄成一個小品文國家完結。决没有你出「袁中郎全集」，而我不印，而另印他人集子的。選本出版到這樣糟，範圍這樣狹隘，出版界的這種風氣，我想也是一個大原因。出版家對「出產的機械」要求旣是如此，選者爲生活所逼，不得不適應對方的要求，這是很不能的事。希望選家能發展新路，同時，也不得不希望出版家，能把這樣壞的風氣改變過來。</p>
<h3>在河灘（續）</h3>
<p>— 莫孚</p>
<p>「前面定是村莊！」</p>
<p>終於在朦朧的月光下，發現一些黑影，驚喜地喊呌起來。愈走近去，更激起狗呌，確定了我們的猜想，心神頓覺鬆舒，呼吸也較自由了。</p>
<p>其實這並算不行村莊，只胡亂兀立着幾座茅屋，很難找到樹木，顯不出什麽街道。狗呌得更兇惡了，然而是單調的，這正顯示出這村莊居民的數目。有没有客店？哪一家是？我們正愁着解决不了的問題，因爲我們是生，而又在夜半。</p>
<p>「這是客店！」</p>
<p>突然聽到站在一家大門前的同伴歡喜的呌喊，現出爲剛纔所没有的活氣，簡想跳躍起來。我們開始高聲朗呌，用手和脚擊在褪色褪皮的黑油大門上。然面任凭我們吃多大勁兒，里面總是靜悄悄的，没應聲，不免使我們着急。同伴們大多坐在自己的行李上，低垂着頭喘息，又陷在無法之中。可是我們肯放過牠嗎？一會便又開始擊起來。</p>
<p>「誰？」突然，有個粗野的聲音詢問。</p>
<p>「客人快開門！」</p>
<p>我們停了手脚，里邊亦不再響了，只好你一句，我一句向着大門告說：我們怎樣渡河，怎樣不能進碼頭，由何處登岸，連來去等等都說完畢之後，意外地聽見門内「嗯」一聲，大門開處，現出個潢臉鬍髭的老年人。他爲我們一羣人的裝束楞住了。自然我待不得他再詢問什麽，便一擁而進。</p>
<p>院子還寬敞，左邊是一列廠房，排着一條條喂牲口的槽，一端有幾隻牲口正嚮着鼻子吃草。從廠房下走出兩個散披着没有弔面的羊皮被的車夫，用鼻音馬哩馬虎地向我們問長問短。</p>
<p>滿臉鬍髭的老人，又出現在我們面前了，想着他就是店主人引我們走進一座點着星星似的無罩煤油燈的三間空房内。</p>
<p>一直到這個時候，方纔恢復經常的意識，拂去畏懼，長久被餓着的肚子覺着隱隱發疼。　　　　「點心呢？餓壞了。」</p>
<p>「店家，開水！」</p>
<p>頓然，這座空房子熱閙起來。爲了取暖，店家便在房子里燒水。一面乾嚼着食物，高一聲，低一聲，談吐各人在河灘所見到的，以及感覺到，想像到的，臉上現着驚愕後特有的歡忭；每談到可怕處，仍不免要綳緊脣，睜圓眼睛。</p>
<p>我坐在火前，漢然地凝視着燒水的老人，回憶這次渡河的經過丨丨最可怕的並不在自己膽怯，吓自己的部分，而在那箭似的激流，怒恚的波浪打着河岸的吼呌，騎在馬上跑不脫的攤塌，乘在破木船，溜着河岸走着，生命隨時都有同師於盡的可能。於此，我算眞瞭解所謂「越過黃河越害怕」，這名俗語了。（完）</p>

<p>陳子展先生的「蚌壳生羅漢」發表之後，有過蔣鴻　先生「科學的解釋」，有過阿英先生材料的採集，因此，可見這　文章，多少是能够引起人的注意了。在不知道蚌壳中的羅漢「乃是人工膺造的」「這個底蘊的，當然覺得稀奇，（見本刋五日陳先生的「再跋」）可是牠的陰影，却逃不過民俗學者的眼光！陳先生的重視這椿事和他的「考據　」，我們可以在他的跋了又跋的精社上看到，但旣要考究牠「是有出典的」，（見本刋十月四日「蚌壳生羅漢」）那我也就來搬搬「死人」。</p>
<p>楊　的山居新話裏，說到文宗好食蛤蜊，蛤蜊中看見過菩薩像，陳先生疑心是元文宗的事；又據傳燈錄，說是唐文宗。但楊瑀旣說文宗把蛤像「置之金粟檀香合，賜興善寺，令致敬焉」，那我們可拿唐太常卿段成式的話來合看；他在酉陽雜俎續集上說：</p>
<p>靖善坊大興善寺······左顧：丨哈像，舊傳云：隋帝嗜哈所食必兼蛤味，數逾數千萬矣；忽有一蛤，椎擊如舊，帝異之；　諸几上，一夜有明：及明，肉自脫，中有一佛二菩薩像，帝悲悔，誓不食蛤！！卷五寺塔記上</p>
<p>這里不是說興善寺裏，到唐時還有蛤像？則隋帝「賜　善寺」，雖没有明說，可是在歷史上，隋代寺塔的修建，要算隋文帝時爲最盛；那末，這問題也可得到很切當的解答了。並且，由此可知蛤像的起源，乃是出在隋文帝身上；！原來是隋朝早京有的！又成式這書同卷，還有蛤像二十字連句，中載「聖柱連句，上有鐵索跡」，不知道是不是指的興善寺中的「聖柱」？或者金陵梵刹志裏可以攷見，可惜手邊没有這書，也就無從稽攷了。</p>
<p>關於這椿事的出典，當然要以隋代爲最早，但不能就說這是牠的本源；因爲這和動物崇拜的迷信有關。神道之被表現在動物的身上，其中還帶有說敎的意味。然而另一方面，乃是蛤本身的被視爲神異之物的結果；禮月令「孟冬之月，雉入大水爲蜃」。蜃即大蛤，也就是蚌，晋郭璞註爾雅說：「蚌，即蜃也」；宋邢昺疏：「蜃，大蛤也」。（爾額註疏釋魚）蚌蛤原屬一物，祇是因大小而異名。而且它不僅是「雉之爲蜃，雀之爲蛤」，（出抱朴子論仙篇。這裏因限於篇幅，不便多說）。尙有：高誘註淮南子：「方諸，大蛤也，熟摩拭令熱，以向月則水生」那樣神秘！於是牠做了道家自然主義理論上的工具了：於是它和方士們的仙道發生關係了：於是到明朝蚌壳中又有八仙壽星等神像的出現（見鄭仲夔雋區）的記載了。</p>

<h3>從火山師來（四）</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>「　·眞不好走呵！沙子弄了我一滿脚。」他們都來了，大家咭咭咕咕地在談話，經他們提醒，我這才發覺自己的　子裏也　滿了沙子，想坐下來弄掉，又想到一　脚仍然會裝滿了沙子的，何必寃枉費力。</p>
<p>的確，這時我才眞正感到沙漢中的生活太苦了！渺渺茫茫的沙漠縱横在你的面前，看不到上棵樹木，一根水草，或者一只飛鳥；口渴得幾乎乎嗓子要發火了，然而在沙漢是弄不到一滴水的，這時我深深地懊悔剛才不該把水菓通通吃掉，否則這時用來解渴，該是如何地快樂的事呀：</p>
<p>脚一踏下去，沙子便蓋上了腿子，你要費盡九年二虎之力才能拔出脚來開步走，可是每走一步，都是一樣地艱難，一樣地拖不動脚。</p>
<p>因此，痛苦和煩腦便由此發生了！</p>
<p>眼看着像螞蟻般的人群蜿蜒地在山嶺上蠕動着，一面羨慕他們的能走，而自己不能趕上去一椿心願，然而沙子偏偏故意與你爲難，你愈想走得快，埋在沙裏的一雙脚便僡抽不出來，更使你着急的是如剪一般的北風呼地吹個不停，於是無數的細沙便像冰雹，不！簡直像手溜彈似的射在你的臉上一般刺痛，眼睛裏，鼻孔裏，耳朶裏······無處不是沙子，頭髮上更是舖滿了沙子，一面走，一面像沙雪一般簌簌地散下。</p>
<p>我這時氣喘喘地再趕不上他們了，常常一雙脚不由自主地停了下來。好幾次跌落在沙子上，像發了包症似的失掉知覺。秦先生在前面等到不耐煩了，拚命地用棍子招呼我們趕上前去。我的精神已疲倦得再也提不起脚步了。但是腦筋還很清楚。牠告訴我：停在這裏是絕對不可能的，向後轉的路程，比向前進的還遠，而且根本没有看到火山。我是决不罷休的。</p>
<h3>伊列山</h3>
<p>— 時玳</p>
<p>「滾繡球。」</p>
<p>「走，看滾繡球去！」</p>
<p>許許多多的人這麽嚷着，他們被希奇的神情吸引着往伊列山走去。孩子們也急着手動脚跳要去看這「百年不遇」的熱閙光景；可是大人們阻攔了這些孩子，縱使他們哭啊號啊，也不許去　那個！孩子發狂似的掙扎着，結果是遭了大人把他們　在蒙古包里又哭又閙。</p>
<p>誰都明白「滾繡球」這種死刑是最殘酷不過！這殘酷不但給予犯人一種慘痛災害，看的人們心上也一樣的害着慘痛！孩子的心靈是脆弱的，萬一受了那種刺激，那是危險的啊！</p>
<p>堆佈着厚雲的天空，陰森的可怕，太陽給他藏得掩掩飾飾。凡由狂暴變成了尖銳，錐錐地刺着皮肉和骨頭。雪的光反照着天空，濃雲變成了灰白的顏色，飛躍着，準備製造雪片向大地散發。</p>
<p>漫漫的平原，巍巍的長山，土丘似的蒙古包，都穿着潔白潔白的外套。</p>
<p>人羣在雪地上蠕動，遠遠地看去，活像白桌布上塗着蒼蠅屎，一點一點的。走着，急促的走着。白光光的伊列山頭，已經擠滿着紫色的動物。</p>
<p>犯人的兩臂朝後綁着，歪斜的欹在雪地上。臉上一點氣色没有，矇朧着眼，嘴唇乾乾的幾乎没了。</p>
<p>「挺年輕的！」不知誰說。</p>
<p>看的人越搪越多，這個扳着那個的肩頭，那個推這個的胳膊，各人弄開各人眼綫　的障碍物，似乎在這時誰都忘記了寒冷。</p>
<p>「幹什麽犯了這樣罪呢？」</p>
<p>是拉薩爾島得老頭子在問誰。</p>
<p>住了半天，一個年輕人回答說：</p>
<p>「偷了薩顏王二十匹馬！」</p>
<p>「好大膽！竟敢偷薩顏王的牲口！」</p>
<p>各種議論在人們口裏冒出來，祇是竊竊的私議，驚恐在每人的心跳來跳去。</p>
<p>一陣騷擾開始，大隊人馬從山下爬上來了。薩顏王穿着油亮油亮的紫袍，黃得照臉的黃馬褂，威風地的走上山頂。</p>
<p>「閃開！閃開！」</p>
<p>托槍的馬隊衛兵，厲聲的喊開人羣。</p>
<p>薩顏王下了馬，衛兵蜂擁的包圍着他，一個滿臉麻子的衛兵走去把那個犯人拖到薩顏王跟前。犯人像一匹死猪似的，不動也不作聲。</p>
<p>不大工夫，薩顏王合煞兩手，把佛珠串在手上，朝着大家宣布犯人的罪狀：</p>
<p>「伊拉特烏蘇，是個頂壞的一個人，他不信奉天神嘈嘛！不守本分，到處偷竊人家的牲畜！大胆的也偷起我的牲口來了！「活佛」告訴我，這人必需有「滾繡球」來懲罰他！不然我們庫庫平原上的人不能過安停日子！」</p>
<p>大家似乎没聽見薩顏王的話，把藏着驚恐的眼，向着將死的犯人伊拉特烏蘇掃射。</p>
<p>「動手！」</p>
<p>喊聲是從薩顏王嘴裏吐出來的。衛兵們粗暴的，用一條牛皮繩子把一塊長圓形的重量有百十來斤的靑石頭，捆在那犯人身上，然後把犯人的頭髮攪亂，倒上一些火油。薩顏王叫聲：</p>
<p>「放！」</p>
<p>於是先前那個麻臉大漢，用火點着那犯人的頭髮上的油，冒着火燄。旁邊過來兩人，把犯人猛力抬起，使勁向山下一扔！火燄閃着花，犯人的身軀從山頂直咕嚕滾到山根底下。薩顏王哈哈大笑，得意揚揚的騎上棗紅駿馬。</p>
<p>悽慘罩住每個看衆的心地。臉上留着憐憫的痕跡。拉薩爾烏得老頭子，拭着眼涙拍了他身邊的一個中年人說：</p>
<p>「求活佛保佑吧！我們不要犯法啊！」</p>
<p>中年人垂下了頭，在想着這幕悲劇的變幻，老人的話他似乎没有經過他的耳邊。</p>
<p>天陰森的，空氣是枯窒的！悲哀掛在人們的臉上，頽喪的走下伊列山。</p>
<p>伊拉特烏蘇的屍體直僵僵地躺在雪地上，白的雪塗着紅的血繩子都斷開了，臉是血肉糢糊的，已經分不清那是鼻子那是嘴。</p>
<h3>繭（四）</h3>
<p>— 林房雄原著靜子譯</p>
<p>酒井的母親丨丨是一個有靜默而帶古風的眉毛的人丨用着很親切的調子，接二連三的說着　雄一向是承愛顧，以後還要請照拂的話，一邊在我的前面，把已經有了白髮的頭低了下去。狼狽而羞恥，滿臉漲得統紅的我，祇是亂點着頭，我不敢正視酒井母親那表現着上品而謙讓的面孔。</p>
<p>從工廠的歸途中，酒井用着極靜默的調子，對我說了他的經歷。在小學校四年級的時候，父親死去而剩下母子兩個人，從父親死去以後，從前還相當可以過活的一家，完全零落了。幾年來，祇靠着母親的一雙手敎養着，他的母親，爲他進中學校而做了絲廠裏的女工丨丨他雖然倔强着不肯進中學校，但是學堂裏的先生們，都勸說這樣半途輟學太可惜了，母親也說要復興酒井的一家，除你以外是没有人了。這樣帶着淚的訴說，　使他開始進了學校。然而爲要繳學費，母親終於不得不在那樣不健康的工廠中，磨滅她的年老殘軀了。他怎麽樣也不想進學校，母親一個月的工錢，祇够敷衍他的學費，然而輟學罷，也是要使皷着滿腔熱望而工作的母親失望的，這樣一半不得已，一半感謝着的進着學校。······</p>
<p>「我這樣的事對誰也没有說過。同時，也没有說的必要。但是你，丨丨祇有你，對我是非常深切。我常同我母親說起，她總是一邊流着涙的說，無論怎樣總想見着你向你謝謝，因此今天請你來了。」</p>
<p>「·······················」</p>
<p>「還有」酒井立刻繼續着說「我把你領到那工廠去，還有一個理由。或者你已注意到了罷。那工廠的老闆，就是我以前用洋刀刺過的那個大河的父親。」</p>
<p>「啊」我點點頭。</p>
<p>「因此，我想我以前所做的事是不很好。没理由的欺侮弱小者，固然是下流，但是我挾了私情的來反抗，也是卑怯的。前幾天那羣人裏，假若没有大河丨丨假若没有那嘲笑我母親在他工廠中做工的大河丨丨我也不至於會拔刀的。等到注意到的時候，我不能不哭我自己卑怯了，」</p>
<p>我遠望着血紅的落日，從街屋頂上慢慢向着海中下沉，這樣一邊望，一邊靜靜的聽着他的話。</p>
<p>經過了兩三年的時日。</p>
<p>我們兩個人都是高等學校的生徒了。酒井得到了縣裏的獎學資金，我也總算無事的通過了入學試騐。</p>

<h3>上周印棉抵空堅漲</h3>
<p>上週期貨市塲、因十二月期補空關係、非常堅挺、現貨交易暢達、奧姆辣新花徴軟、日本輸出陸續買進、同時即期交貨之成交亦不少、新棉走動漸增、惟奧姆辣花之到貨、仍不足以應套賣之需要、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>天津花市平淡</h3>
<p>（津訊）西河花市氣仍含弱意、西洋商進胃尙好、但吃價亦低、福家洋行買進三百七十包、開價三十六元五角、又一百零六包、價三十六元三角、其他進胃平平、買進一百包、開價三十五元五角、又西河美種市况仍顯清澹、市價稍露搖動、申帮裕記買進二百三十五包、開價四十六元</p>
<h3>糧食無稽謠言騷動粉市</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份忽見巨大之風波、因市塲突起謠言、致人心激動、市面遂先狂漲而後跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥祇好二角左右、坎拿大好一角半左右、在事實上無狂漲之理、而開價後、市氣狂騰、即因某經紀人傳出洋麥定將加稅、又傳大連現粉需要甚切、致買氣濃厚、開價即紛紛收買、遠期因買戶集中、漲度竟達五六分之巨、如五月份高漲六角八分、二盤謠言未息、近期仍好、拍至三月份、則謠言不確、多頭又紛紛抛賣、市面即驟落二三分、以後進出已少、轉趨平定、迨至下午開盤、交易已轉清淡、上午之投機多頭、續有回出、市面已轉平疲之勢、此種漲落、多起于謠言、實非經營之道也、結果本月份較好七厘半、一月份不動、二月份好一分、三月至五月份、各好七厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥先大漲後小跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、先則狂漲、後則回落、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二角左右、坎拿大好一角零不等、當開價時、以謠傳洋麥加稅有實行之說、故開價後人心大好、本月份提至九角八分、一月份至一角半、二月份至三角、三月份至四角半、較前週末收價、計漲一角左右之巨、迨至收盤、以謠傳並非事實、即回跌五六分、迨至下午開盤、本月份尙見平定、遠期則因多頭回出、續小一二分、查此次風波、全係捕風捉影、爲投機市塲所常有之事也、結果本月仍好四分、一月份好二分、二月份好四分、三月份不常、四月份好四分、現麥市面、尙見平定、聞歸德麥四元零四分、瑤灣海州麥四元零二分、揚州麥三元九角五六分、計一萬二千包、由福新申大辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、因空方抵補及經紀行購買而平、傳阿根廷雨水滂沱、玉蜀黍現貨無甚需要、聞有人起而活動阻止加拿大次等麥之輸入、但市塲對此消息所生之所感、似乎平常、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥廿一日　廿二日　上落</p>

<h3>高客秈售價帶緊</h3>
<p>丨期洋米擯不售開丨</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、本客去化均活、惟洋米期貨因市價與担保之互持、以致全日未有只包成交、現洋米開西貢二千包、暹邏碎米一千包、又元米機米各二百包、由内地本街分去、行情亦無大出入、因市上存底尙充、定貨尤多、市價一時不易喊大、客秈昨内地去化稍濃、本街亦以昨日爲公會開全體大會、南北河下米一律停市一天、故去胃亦稍見活、惟存米尚近十萬、到頭亦源源不絕、因此只有糙　稍見帶緊、高貨略見扳足、中次各米依然平軟、全日成交各秈五千四百包、糙粳機紅各二百多包、機紅爲北洋辦去、其餘仍由本街内地分去、</p>
<h3>油市豆油進口稅已實徵</h3>
<p>丨致市價漲六七角丨</p>
<p>昨日豆油及花生油市、因市塲中盛傳請求國府减免東省油之進口稅事、勢告失望、因國内油廠商等竭力反對、所以必須抽足三十（値百抽三十）、故在此封河期内、來源告缺之際、人心一致反動、市塲中充滿緊張局面、結果豆油轉漲五六角、花生油漲七角、花生油刻下無底積、祇可隨到隨化、豆油存積尙有、但大小簍亦祇一萬餘件、昨統計開花生油七百件、豆油一千件、</p>
<h3>白桐油漢市缺現</h3>
<p>白桐油近半月來漢市洋莊採辦、繼續不絕、致當此新貨旺出之際、價格欲跌未能、且在各產地收買、而漢上來源反不甚旺、似有供不敷求之勢、所以現油大感缺乏、洋莊價格售至每担三十元洋規、如有多數現油、尙可加起四六角、亦有洋行要辦、行家開進襄桐二二五元光景、支簍二十五元三四角連稅、惟所到僅數百担、大批貨極少、因均各洋行在產地截辦、於是漢市到貨稀少、浙路金蘭一帶產數較多、但度數不足、祇能供内銷之用、洋莊嫌不足度、縱市俏而其貨反呆、本埠號家雖有辦到、亦非多數耳、現在洋行到處辦油、故後市縱　已有限、</p>
<h3>糖市潮靑續開五百包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以粗砂白現貨仍缺、趨勢堅定、公會划盤二四粗砂白普通十八元七角、比前日又升三分、碼頭交貨十八元七角七分、轉口貨因今日封關無划出、八九號荷赤普通十四元、太古糖及本廠白無上落、新潮靑昨日續有開出五百包之譜、價爲十一元八角七角至五六角、次之十一元二三角、第二批新刁靑、昨由太古公司濟南輪運到七百九十六包、適逢潮靑疲跌、其勢又須虧本、據廣東電訊、地價尙挺、祝靑須十元八角、片靑十元四五角、加上一切外費、暫難合划、故潮靑到數雖多、然已跌去六七角、後市恐難過賤也、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉地價步漢</h3>
<p>龍口綫粉干、近愉地頭天氣愈寒、出品已難續製、故市勢步緊、昨據電訊、初爲二十八元半、繼爲二十八元七角、終則升至二十九元、較之前盤每包又升七八角、因此申市隨緊、北規叫二十三元、售過二十二元半、南規亦需二十一元外、現在銷令正屆、後市尙防再緊、</p>

<h3>證劵多空均在掉其公債漲跌互見</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、本月份期貨已屆最後一二日、市上籌碼、尙有一部份未能軋平者、故掉期交易獨旺、散戶套利買賣、亦仍甚踴躍趨勢暫將脫離環境、各以其多空供求之同不、而自爲風氣、故洋拆　四角之高價、已不關休戚、醞釀之中美　欵、其主　亦與前傳情形不單、匯豐擬由港運回白銀二千萬、或係事實、但是否即在市面流通、尙有問題、政府對於維持銀荒、兼籌開顧、不遺餘力、最近將來、必有妥善辦法、以穩定市面、公債市塲、人心比較安定、趨勢亦漸漸好轉、查本月期存賬祇餘三千萬左右、遠期則積有五千萬、故目下形勢、當無多大波瀾矣、今日爲本月期最後一日、或尙有傾軋、昨日經過、開盤即一致上漲、十六二十及二十一號等均有買進、套利交易亦湧、塲内賣戶稀少、計漲一二角至半元左右、市價漸恢復中庸狀態、次盤四十三·四十八及五十三號等復有賣出、大槪爲上週多頭之出籠、市價怱一致傾跌、愈後愈猛、廿二關猛小八角半、大半爲多頭掉期壓小、多數已跌過頭盤之漲、午後形勢穩定、惟開盤前列隨上午趨勢而跌、多頭復有掉期、善後本月怱小六角、自金短起、十六號二十號又有空頭掉期、市價乃又冉冉回上三四角、高低漸漸拉平、收盤消息、有白銀二千萬回滬之說、四號買進、善後回上四角半、餘亦均好二三角、市價結果、以多空掉期取捨不同之關係、高低不一、大都漲我跌少、爲數約三五角、成交總數、約共二千萬以上、茲將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元）</p>

<h3>寃獄賠償運動</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>打官司原是一件最不幸的事，也是一件最痛苦的事，無論刑民案件，一經涉訟，勝負不數，殊難懸測。卽幸而勝訴，是非曲直，得以大白，而一切手續的麻煩，和訟費的擔負，已屬不貲。更有經年累月，而纏訟不休，致當事人蕩產破家的，比比皆是，訴訟豈不是一件最不幸而最痛苦的事情麽？</p>
<p>語曰「衙門堂堂開，有理無錢莫進來，」故司法衙門的黑暗，從前卽已如此的。漢釋之曰：「法者天下之公共也。」周勃曰「吾嘗將百萬軍，安知獄吏之貴乎。」故由前之說，法是天下的公器，不得由法官任意出入，以曲作直，由後之說，三木之下，無求不得，生殺由心，好惡在口，何等可怕的權威呀。</p>
<p>雖曰，法官原有法律爲根據，事實爲標凖，不能隨意出入，顚倒是非。要知事情的曲折，條文的採用，均有高下在心，任意武斷的可能。故從前公牘中有「法無可恕，情有可原。」的兩句妙語，而一顚倒間，罪名的輕重，頗有出入。並有用刀殺人，而改爲甩刀殺人者，一輕一重，卽在半筆之間。現在法律雖已改訂，而歪曲事實，隨意出入，仍有絕對的可能性也。</p>
<p>故處法官的地位，而不能清白乃心，任情用事，則當事人的痛苦，眞有「啞吧吃黃連有話說不出的苦呢。」無論法官的貪贓枉法，以曲作直，而判斷案件，往往失其公平的原則，自不必說。卽使不明社會情形，不解案情曲折，任意武斷，而寃案已成，或者自矜明察，逆臆案情，顚倒是非，任意判斷，亦可造成寃案，總之因愛賄而判斷不公的，司法官固當負其重責，卽大意和疎忽，而造成寃獄，司法官亦不能不負其責任。</p>
<p>司法雖云獨立，而法官的權威，並非絕對無限，對於國家社會均應負相當責任。司法官吏，往往誤解裁判不受干涉，及上訴的意義，以爲不受干涉，便可自由處判决，已受名譽和事實的損失，卽使上訴而得平反，其精神物質上的損失，更屬不計，如此情形，而法官絕不負何等之責任，宜其高下在心，而絕無顧忌矣。</p>
<p>現在因果之說，固不足以救濟爲惡者的人心，但爲法官而不察當事人之痛苦，而惟利是圖，任意判斷，使當事的一方，竟至寃沉海底，眞理莫伸，怨氣所積必有任其咎者。</p>

<p>計算了日期，輪船今天是可以到埠的；但我又不敢自信，怕到碼頭去空等。於是，走到旅館去詢問，據說午後五六時輪船卽可靠近碼頭。</p>
<p>初冬的太陽，一早就收歛了它的軟弱無力的光輝，逃進西邊的地平綫下去休息了。寒風雖然像利刀似的那麽厲害。刮得那些趕路的人的耳朶和鼻尖像猪必般的紅暈，然而爲了一别經年的英和可愛純潔無邪的小孩子的歸來的快樂，使我反覺得一點也不寒冷，忽忙地走上黃浦灘的碼頭去了。</p>
<p>碼頭上依舊地是那麽的嘈雜的，搬運貨物的小工們的吭唷的哼聲，宏亮的，充分地表現出他們的氣力，販賣零食的小販的悠揚的呌賣聲，和那穿着號衣的旅館的接客人的談笑聲，嘈雜得會使人神經昏亂。</p>
<p>靠近碼頭的那艘龐大的「新疆」輪，泰然地像小山似的緊倚在浮碼頭的傍邊，巨大的烟囱，輕微的吐出團團的黑烟來，讓小工們把貨物裝進肚子裏去。</p>
<p>！啊，這就是去年帶走我的英和天眞活潑的小孩子的「新疆」輪的。</p>
<p>於是，過去的悲哀的痕跡，又重新浮現上我的心坎來。</p>
<p>那是去年的一個炎熱的夏天的時候，那時我正失了業，在海上過着流浪的生活，經濟的窮困，時常使這三口兒的小家庭的喝吃發生恐慌，於是，我開始地感到非常的痛苦，雖然小孩子時常做着無邪的笑容，很親切地逗着我發笑要我抱，可是我總覺得無論如何這孩子是太累了我了，詛咒他不該這樣早就生出世來。但，小孩子是天眞的，他不曉得受生活的重担厭迫得透不過氣的父親的内心的不好過、老是閃着一雙黑潤明亮的小眸子，露出自然的嘻笑。有時爲了小孩子耐不了饖餓而痛哭，打斷了我的思路，寫不出文章，惹起了我的憤怒，恨恨地在小孩子的臀部上毒打了一下，因此，英不不服氣了，說我太不負責任，和我少閙起來，直挺挺地躺倒在床上抽咽着。</p>
<p>終於在一天的晚夜，黑黝黝的天空嵌綴着密密的繁星，點點的螢火虫燃着鑽入孩子們的夢境的火炬，從這個黑暗我角落裏飛到那個黑暗的角落裏，去勾引着孩子們的追逐，跳呌的夏天的晚夜，英抱着小孩子和我同坐在簷下納凉，英沉思了一會，很正經地對我說：</p>
<p>「仁，現在我們的生活是這樣的潦倒，我們眞有點挨不下去，尤其是這小孩子。我想我還的帶着這孩子回到南方去，這樣可以减輕你的負担，好讓你安心地去努力」。英的聲间顫抖了，我猜想她定在暗地裏流淚。</p>
<p>「我以爲還是不走的好，橫堅這生活是不會長久的。英，是嗎」？想起英要走，我的心就有點酸了。然而年來的生活的不安定，又使我覺得太對不住英和小孩子。</p>
<p>「不，我還是走的好，到南方去說不定可以找到一點事情做」。英毫不遲疑很肯定地回答。</p>
<p>於是英和天眞的小孩子就給這「新疆」輪帶走了。</p>
<p>夜的黑幕已垂到大地上，把對江遠遠的一切的景物都弄得糢糊不清，這時碼頭上的邦燈已於出光明了。我底心開始地有點憔急，對着轉回身兒想回去的接客的伙伴們詢向着：</p>
<p>「怎麽船還没有駛靠碼頭呢」？</p>
<p>「今晚怕要停在吳淞口外喲」。接客的伙伴們擦着手背淡淡地答着，像歸林的鳥兒散開了。</p>
<p>於是我感覺到萬分的失望，同時冰冷的寒風，刺襲了我的單薄的秋外套，使我忍不住地顫抖起來，我終於趕快地離開這嘈雜的碼頭，懷着失望的心回歸家裏去。</p>
<h3>生活的意義</h3>
<p>— 不白</p>
<p>老友：</p>
<p>我們大家都看過「桃李刦」號張影片了！當你走出金城大戲院後，老友！你不是這末說：「我反而對於生活害怕了！萎縮了！」我那時並不曾對你說過什麽，我們是默默地走着，走着。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>我在想；那個影片的男主角，爲了要生活下去，由輪船公司的職員而降到爲一個建築工廠裏的工人，再跌下去，做了偷兒，畢竟因拒捕而槍决了！啊！的確，這對於生活怎不要使你害怕呢？萎縮呢？</p>
<p>想着，默默地走着，我們是畢竟在十字街頭分離了。回過頭來，我見着你跟你愛人的背影，我搖着頭，向你們的背影歏出了口氣。</p>
<p>唉！老友！你對生活害怕，你像一朶鮮艷的花，遇着寒冽的冬風而萎縮啊！是多可憐呵！</p>
<p>今天突地接到你的來信，約我談話。在談話中，我曉得你是多苦悶呵！你不想回到腐化的家庭裏去，可是你也没有勇氣租一個亭子間，來過着你所羨慕的「野玫瑰」的生活。因爲你說；這是頗爲不便的，例如泡水呀1以及一切的雜差。</p>
<p>可是老友！你畢竟又歏息了；「我對於生活害怕了！萎縮了！」</p>
<p>老友！在這裏，你對於「生活」的意義是太誤解了！你認爲凡是需要「鬥爭」的才是生活，可是老友呵！你的對於生活的認識是錯誤了，就在這一錯誤間，你是太缺少了「進取」的心！</p>
<p>生活，是的生活，凡是一個嬰孩從娘胎裏一出世界，他就得生活。生活是無時無刻不需要「鬥爭」的。如果没有對環境「鬥爭」的力量，那才會没有生活，没有生活，不是變成了個在墳墓裏的人了麽？所以，凡是個人，他總是有「生活」的，也就是說，他是至少有「或多」「或少」的鬥爭的力量的。對生活害怕，到後來，畢竟要被環境所殺！</p>
<p>老友！這樣，你是在「生活，」也就是你是在爲生活而鬥爭着呵！不過老友！恕我這末不客氣地批判你，你是太缺乏了「向前進」的勇氣，又加以你認爲只有「鬥爭性」的才是生活，因此，你才害怕鬥爭的生活。殊不知你現在生活着，不也時刻地在鬥爭着麽？</p>
<p>話說得太多了！你覺得厭煗麽？一句話，你是太缺乏「向前進」的勇氣了。</p>
<p>最後，得請你瞭解，一個新時代的靑年，都要有「自我批判」的精神，我們要時刻地檢舉我們自己，我們要時刻地督厲我們自己！爲什麽？因爲我們深怕我們會「向後轉！」</p>
<p>生活是鬥爭的！鬥爭的才星活！祝你向前進！</p>
<h3>爐邊雜感</h3>
<p>— 小林</p>
<p>天氣冷了，對於咱這窮小子就是一種威脅，外面鎭日價刮北風，太陽躱在雲叢裏，連臉亦懶得露出來。在這種時光，正合有錢人的玩賞興緻，氣候的變遷是跟他們不發生任何關連的，而反因季候的不同，倒是給予他們一種更有味的心境的愉愉。到了這樣冰冷的冬天裏，如果逢着窗外在降着雪花，那種景緻是愈加美麗了，他們的身子是裝在溫暖的華貴的熱水汀房裏，只須穿着一件薄薄的單衣鑑賞着外邊雪的銀色的世界。也許一面便開着播音機，唱幾隻肉麻的歌，陶醉地過着特殊冬日裏詩意樣的日子。要是逢到了興趣濃的時間，輕便地攢進汽車裏，一下子就馳騁在郊外觀雪去了。</p>
<p>咱這窮小子是没這種福份兒的，現在不外在閉起眼睛作一番幻想的羨慕而已。有時便連幻想的權利都會覺得非常可貴的。因爲一睜開眼來，現實的苦惱就立刻紛然的集中到腦上來了。擺在跟前是一隻小小的鐵爐子丨丨權作是熱水汀也無不可吧。放下幾塊黑炭，就此取點煖意。以外還是花生米一包，黃酒一碗，緩緩的喝着酒，啖着花生，瞧爐裏升起一片片熊熊的紅火。想一想冬天能够過着這樣的日子亦不可不說是舒服的，人應該是適可而引爲滿足的，何用奢求，黃酒幾杯，花生一堆，淡淡的意味當中却亦有並不淡的意味，如若嫌一個人悶在屋子裏未免太孤寂，便無妨多呌幾個人來，人一多，而又是都嗜酒的，那便添點酒，添點下酒物，大家圍在爐邊，紅的火光照得各人的臉熱烘烘，喝過了酒已有點紅的色的面龐就越顯出紅來了。於是大家談呀說的，都帶着酒意，比平時格外興奮，有人全無吝嗇地把尋常不願意說的甜的戀史滔滔地說出來了，聽着的亦感的頗爲够味的。可是到了須要開播音機末幾隻流行的曲子的時候是没有的。於是善歌者自己張開嗓子唱起來了，而唱起來是比較更爲親切而動人的。這樣的一種情形，有酒，有歌，有說笑，時間也就狠愉快地挨過去了。</p>
<p>可是忽然靜寂了一下，靜寂以後，談來談去不知怎的就談到各人自己身上來，一談到自己身上，彼此剛剛一股勁不禁一瞬間全没了下去。空氣馬上轉得非常窒悶了，好像快要凝固一樣，大家各自無言，默默的低着頭，誰也不想開口說一句話，都被自己煩惱所纏住跌入煩惱之網了。除了有一絲絲細微的嘆息之外，就只有爐裏劈剃的聲息了。爲了什麽，使大家突的如此頽唐呢！這是誰也不願意說出來的！祇讓自家心裏曉得。自己是亦有同樣的感覺没有别的，所嘆息的是爲了這樣平凡的日子亦不輕易度了，而都是在咬着牙根支持的。</p>
<p>尙有什麽可以歡幸呢。還不是借着暫時的沉醉來暫時麻痺了痛楚的知覺。可是痛楚往往不會因此而忘記，因是痛苦更加難受了。</p>
<p>直到夜痘闌，大家都有些倦意了。送他們出門。回到狹小而凍冰的屋子裏。爐裏的火已漸漸薄弱，剩下的只有幾塊炭。大約今夜燃不上半夜就完了的。而此時外邊的雪降得越大，擔心他們在回歸途上，適才喝了酒還没完全消散，說不定會受了冷的，明天病倒了怎麽辦？然而當摸到自已口袋裏時，只留下幾個銅子，炭没法添，就是明年的生計都無着落。酒意早早就没了，滿身熱也退，想下去感情同四肢一同也冷了。就朦胡地蒙進被窩裏去，一切到了明天再說吧！</p>
<p>— 愚言</p>
<h3>母親的眼淚</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>流，流，流，不停地流；母親的眼淚是流不盡的！</p>
<p>我最怕見的是母親的眼淚，因爲一見到母親的眼淚，便以裏要感到不安的慚愧的；可是她偏是常常的要在我面前流然而她爲什麽要流呢？我又怎樣可以使她不流呢？唉，說起來眞是覺得萬分的慚愧！</p>
<p>這也許是我太不長進的原故吧！所以養了這麽大的兒子，還要累她老人家操勞奔波，却不能安安逸的過一天日子，照理說：她是那樣年紀了，兒子那末大啦！媳婦已經娶在家裏，孫子已經抱在手裏，照一般人看來，眞是蠻好的福氣；但是，但是她没有福只有氣！我實在是罪孽深重！</p>
<p>母親這幾年來更加老瘦了，還有那咳嗽病也比前幾年重了好些，然而她還是那麽有好勝心的，始終不肯讓年靑人走上前一步，她見她兒子丨我丨的景况很窘，開支是一天大一天，而進益却日見减少，她很替我擔心，因此總要爬天拉地的相帮我去生產一些，况且最近幾年農村破產了之後，我更遭受了一個龐大打擊！</p>
<p>不過我們母子俩的天性，與别人的「母慈子孝」的情形却不同，我們祇要一碰在一起便會口角，終於由口角而至爭執。她喜歡嘮叨，我則生性暴躁，兩個人都是一樣的固執。每次口角之後，她便飯也不吃，躺到床裏去流淚，那時我也躱到床裏去流淚：内心的矛盾，交織得我很痛苦，我自己悔恨不應該去和她衝突。但是等到閒話擱在嘴邊的時候，那又駇不回來，更不暇權衡輕重了。隔了一天，大家又會互相安慰起來，可是過些時候，一言不合便又衝突了。我眞是一個不孝者，她這樣的帮且我，我何以竟連一句話都不肯讓步的呢！我咒詛自己，爲什麽不肯諒解她呢？</p>
<p>記得我學業滿師後第一次返鄕，那時我眞彷彿考中了狀元後，奉旨衣錦還鄕一般的高興，在動身前幾天，就寫了一封信回去告訴母親我幾時返鄕，從此便眼巴巴的希望返鄕的日期快些來臨。一顆心眞有「歸心如箭！」的那種情形，然而日子却偏偏格外來的慢，似乎有意和我做對，在夜裏，也不知做了多少次返鄕的美夢，夢着母親見了我回來怎樣的快樂，快樂得發笑，笑得眼淚都淌了出來。</p>
<p>回到家裏，到第二天又和她衝突了；於是住了三天我便回到了店裏。這一次我整整的哭了三天，而且哭得弱傷心，到了店裏又痛快的哭了一塲，我生平就是不肯愛委曲。</p>
<p>前天，母親到上海來，我又和她口角了，口角了她便出眼淚，我不忍看她的眼淚，但却無法呌她不出。後來我回來自己却暗自淌了一夜眼淚，第二天晚上想去送她上火車，但她却早已悄然地走了。我失望地悲痛地在站徘徊了三個鐘頭，回來已是深夜一時。唉！我太忍心，我眞該跪在十字架前去受刑罰了！</p>

<h3>關於火山的說明</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>現在我有一個關於自然科學的問題，想請您替我解答一下。</p>
<p>我常常看見報上登着各國火山爆發的新聞，很爲奇怪。想火山是什麽原因造成呢？爲什麽會爆發呢？我曾問過許多的人，但他們的答覆都是很含　糊的，不明確的，使我聽了更加懷疑，所以特寫這封信給您，我想您一定能够滿上我的希望吧！敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　　王越敬上</p>
<p>編者按：關於自然科學問題，我們雖没有多大的研究，但如讀者有這種問題見詢，我們亦當儘我所知，或轉請各専家代爲解答，總想使讀者能得到一個比較明確的認識爲是。</p>
<p>火山如何會爆發起來？實在是一個很有趣味的問題。在不知道的人看來，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>一定是覺得很奇怪，很神秘，但經過各科學家精密的研究之後，我們可以知道這也不過是宇宙間的一種自然現象吧了</p>
<p>談到火山的成因，便要涉及地球的内部問題。關於地球内部的組織，我們還没有得到明白的認識，因爲在目前缺乏極好，極完備的儀器，可以看到地心中去。但根據各科學家的推測，火山的造成和爆發的原因，似不外乎水氣和熱力。有人說：地球旣然是由於一種極熱的氣體變成的，那末現在内部一定還保留着很高的熱度。有的又相信：熱是由地層變動的時候，互相摩擦而生的。自從放射原質發明以來，又有人相信：地球是各元素的原子破裂而生的。火山亦同此理。雖然誰是誰非，現在還不能確定的判斷，但是我們根據一般的常識，可以相信地球的内部的確蘊藏着很高的熱度，同時岩漿又始終不能凝固，時刻爲地殻所壓縮，自然有很大的臌脹力，一旦地殻受外界的剥蝕而鬆動，勢必要被脹裂，岩漿勢必要乘機衝射出來。這就是所謂火山的普通解說。</p>
<p>火山的爆發有猛烈的，也有和緩的。大槪時常噴發的火山，多是和緩的。熄滅很久而復爆發的火山，多是猛烈的；而且停熄的時間越長，爆發得越猛。猛烈的火山在爆發的時候，海中掀起絕大的波浪，船要都被衝翻了；海岸也連帶着震動極烈，房屋多被毁壞，人畜的傷亡，更屬駭人。那時的情形眞是可怕極了。不過中國境内的火山很少，最多的是太平洋流域的美洲以及日本等地方</p>

<h3>交通部大厦建築之梗槪情形</h3>
<p>— 阿壽</p>
<p>建築四年有半，方始落成之交通部大厦，已於本月内，開始倩人參觀，其巍峨雄偉之氣槪，其精雋實用之設備，乃首都任何建築物所不能及，至若中國白宮國府，鐵道部，外交部，以及其他政府機關，精則精矣，偉則偉矣，然與交通部相較，實有天淵之别，宛若小巫之見大巫也。</p>
<p>交通部大厦位於首都北城，薩家灣南首，與鐵道部東西相望，厦成方形，計佔地五十畝，建築費用約二，○○○，○○○元，建築時間，開始於西歷一千九百三十一年，由前交通部長王伯羣，與新豐記訂合同，而囑一俄籍建築師設計圖樣，因同年九一八事件發生，工事遂中輟，其後經今交長朱家　氏蒞任以來，督促闢劃，繼續經營，乃有今日之新大厦，以光輝首都，而傲居新都一切建築物之上焉。</p>
<p>大厦外表，極富麗堂皇莊嚴靜肅之能事，圖樣採中西合璧宮殿形式，大門闢在中山路旁，共有南北兩門，其間距離約三十碼，並以短圍牆相連，門外四周繞以環牆及護厦小河一修，清水湧流，别有風緻，河之上架以石橋，用以行路，且壯觀瞻，大門之内，右爲傳達室，左爲警衛室，每段種植奇花美草，綠樹秀木，點綴其間。</p>
<p>新厦共分四樓，相互聯接，正中乃兩座四層樓，樓頂有一小小亭臺，及露天花園在焉，主要大厦之旁，左右輔以三層樓兩座，據稱郵政總局及電政局卽在此兩座樓内辦公，大厦總門計有四進，其逢單數者（卽第一道門第三道門），乃屬宮殿式亭閣門，其逢雙數者，乃屬城門式圓洞門，門之内有花園，通接後樓大厦，厦内屋室共分三百餘間，其中卽各司廳辦公室，間間相對，門門互峙，窗之方向均朝外，係用水泥築成，頗平滑潔淨，辦公室内，地板盡屬洋松木釘成，上塗以古銅色油漆，明朗照人，四壁牆面，均用白色，而部次長辦公室牆壁，則另以綠色金邊牆布修飾之，四層樓各屋之分配，已大致就绪，底層作總務司，技術官室，及會食廳之用；二樓有部次長辦公室，以及秘書廳，參事廳，航政司，大禮堂在焉，三樓凡郵政司，電政司，職工事務委員會辦公室均在此樓；四樓，乃會計長辦公室及圖書室；二樓之佈置，可稱全部之精華均集中於此，大禮堂之面積，宏大廣闊，有六大朱紅木柱支撑，堂頂雕刻精細，配色醒目，用綠金色相配，相得益彰，地板係用西洋上等木條截拚而成各色各樣花紋圖案，段置之華麗，設備之秀美，爲我國建築界生色不少，禮臺之廣寬實用，旣可作跳無歡宴之用，又復能借作舞台之需，全堂有皮座椅千數左右，至少可容人七百於一堂。</p>
<p>二樓後樓，乃部長辦公處，計佔三大間一小間，房屋支配成辦公室，更衣室，大會客室，小會客室四間，辦肥室骨裝飾佈置，精美絕倫，一切應用物品，莫不應有盡有，桌上置有三架電話，尤屬其他各部所稀有，至於次長辦公處，則位於二樓前樓，與部長一切設備，均無差異，不過缺少一會客室而已。</p>
<p>其他各間内之設備，侬俱等，均屬西式，電氣，暖氣，電鈴，電話，無綫電等，無不係最近廿世紀新式之裝置，其中電燈，電話，無綫電等，均係由西門子洋行所供給，其電鈴則裝置於牆壁中，電話可以三用：（一）自動與部中人員，接談公務；（二）與外界接洽；（三）當部中有人通話時，倘有緊急事務相商，可不妨先談，然後不打斷其他人之交談；大致此項設施，乃首都各政府機關以前所未有，不過此新厦猶有一種，用電話之便利，而開會討論部中要務，而不必聚集各人於一室而交換意見，如此可增加辦事能力及效率不少，據稱交通部搬裝，業已齊舒，郵政總局，將於明年一月，由滬移京辦公，聞交通部此次新厦建築費，係郵政儲金匯業局内之盈餘，抽撥所造成云云。</p>
<h3>首都建築槪况（續）</h3>
<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>過去南京的建築，因人口關係，所以是非常的衰落：建都後南京的建築，其發達的現象，是不想而可知的，據工務局的統計，近四年來的建築，是逐步進展的，現將民二十年至本年六月的建築面積，起數造價，寫在下面，計民國二十年，建築住宅所佔的土地面積，爲四六·七四○平方公尺，建築費七·一四九·四九五元，工程一·○三四起；民二十一年，建築佔九○·八五五平方公尺，造價三·九一一·三五二元，工程六百六十五起；民二十二年，建築面積二三·七七五平方公尺，造價三·○八四·三八一元，工程七百五十一起；本年上年六個月，建築面積一一·三三二平方公尺。造價四百二十萬六千○三十四元，工程四百十七起，在過去三年零六個月裏，共計建築面積十七萬二千七百○二平方公尺，造價一千八百三十五萬一千二百六十二元，工程二千八百六十七起，至於那些翻造和改舊的建築還不在内呢，在上面這個數額裏，是可想見其現狀建築的一般。</p>
<p>當南京未建都以前所有的建築大都集中，城東城西一帶其城北一隅除却官署領館和一二資產者的自建洋樓大厦以外，多是而窮民棲身的矮房茅屋，是談不到建築的，所以，很不容易找到整齊的住宅，首都以後，因人口的日增加，以南京少數的住宅，當然容不下來這龐大人口的居住，在數年前，尙能看到荒地和池塘，現在呢，已很多變成了崇樓大厦的建築地了；像慧圓里，金湯里，良友里，文華里，忠林坊，紫金坊，忠義坊，五台山村，梅園新村，桃源新村···等，都是以前荒地池塘的新建築，而且，這些里坊村，每處的房屋，多凡數十宅或至百數十宅，其他的小規模營造，更是不勝其枚舉了，至於私人的住宅建築，爲數却也不少哩！以南京的土地面積，其爲四七七·八四五方公里，較之現在的人口和建築，顯然的，是未見得怎樣的擁擠，但南京已經有分區制度的規定，計分六區；（一）中央政治區，（二）文化區，（三）市園區，（四）住宅區，（五）商業區，（六）工業區；雖然界限迄今還没有精密的確定，在未來，當然是要確定的，因爲都市的不分區，那末，建築上必致攙雜，於市民生活上，和整個市客上，都有極大的妨碍，所以，南京市早已注意到劃分六區，而其住宅的地段，却在城北鼓樓附近，及城西北，計自西華門起，沿中山路一帶，上面曾經說過，城北在未建都前，是談不到建築，而異常荒落的地方，現在，因爲規定住宅區，來客納人口的居住所以在過去數年，建築物是添了不少，未來的膨脹，是指顧間呢。</p>
<p>因南京市的人口日見增漲，房地產的騰貴，原是必然的趨勢；在從前，不値錢的地產，到今日已是很騰貴的價格了，據最近財政局核准賣買的土地價來說，也可見南京地價的一般情形了，和平門外郭家橋每方要售一六九十元，中華路後畝値四千元，中山路每畝萬元以上，住宅區赤壁路每畝値五千元，中正路每方値一百二十元，油市大街，每畝二千五六百萬元，建業路每畝値三千元，國府西街每畝値五六千元，城北慧圓里每方値一百元，中山路每畝一萬二三千元；終之，地價是和建築事業一樣是逐年的猛漲着，地價旣如是高漲，於是居民對居住上便成一個嚴重的問題，因爲都市人口的增加，地價的騰貴，那末房租的日趨高昂，是有連鎖性的，過去南京的房租，是很便宜的，倘若化了數十元一月的代價，卽可租到一所很像樣的住宅了，現在呢，竟超出數年前租價四五倍，而且押租的額大，過於房租三五倍，甚或至七八倍，這種的現象，更足徵明住宅的供不敷求的狀况，結果出了高昂的代價，共得到的居住，不過猶如白斂籠式罷了，如城北新造的里村坊，那處房屋開間不甚闊大，也不想怎樣舒服，獨居一宅，已是覺得很侷促了，而其租價之高，每月四十元至百餘元不等呢，所以一般居民月耗收入十分之二三的租金，而住的房子，還是閉塞的，四周住的人，是很緊密的，害種居住的結果，不但在國民經濟上發生重大的影響，而且以致身體赢弱，精神衰疲，種種無形的損失，是非常重大，那末，市政當局，鑒於人口的日漸增加，應當有平民建築的必要，來解决南京市的居住才是，未了，南京市的未來建築，隨着政治的鞏固，正是方興末艾呢！（完）</p>

<h3>談談酒排間的設計（下）</h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>關於内部的丨丨這就是指酒排間圍墻大門以内的結構：其中所應加注意者，（一）跳舞地板：酒排間中。跳舞是爲連帶關係的營業，故須設計跳舞地板。（二）爲便利婦女顧客計，須設化妝梳洗室。（三）室内地盤之分配必加攷究，（四）通大菜間的樓梯，須長而闊，且宜光亮明察，以利人行。（五）樓頭可裝飾，字畫花朶，掛帷之類。（六）餐室中不妨安置較粗屋柱；而大菜間，有時可劃分成無數小餐室，惟是種餐室之隔板，宜加不傳聲之複壁，以方便顧客之秘密。（七）有時爲適應團體或家庭性質的顧客，可照公寓方式，設計時多裝起居室，私人盥洗室，餐室等，以備服用。（八）在可能之情况下，屋頂花園之設計亦爲必要。（九）關於竈間，伙食間，必須位置得宜，可省時不少，若焙爐，酒庫，等可設在大菜間之下層，是爲一例。</p>
<p>關於外部的丨丨這僅是大門及墻飾兩項之外觀巳耳，莊嚴合時，引人之景，新奇之式，醒目之色，種種均宜顧到。而靠街窗亦以使人注意神秘爲佳，亦須時時預備換新裝修，藉促人知。出入大門，必須開閉靈活，而其闊以得四五人並行出入爲最低限度，若用轉旋式玻璃推門亦可。</p>
<p>（乙）工事酒排間設計中，其關於工事的，可分，空氣，升降梯，光綫，電話，無綫電收音，等項：（一）屋中空氣，其所佔之地位頗重，須設計其流通週轉，不使烏烟瘴氣爲最重。（二）升降梯之設計，須新式安全，快速，其備用除運人外，食物之輸送，亦可直接上下矣。（三）光綫之在酒排間中，有關跳舞及音樂，故須設計合宜。（四）電話之設計，在酒排間中以人口衆雜，須時加消毒，而電話間之地位，以出入方便之中心地帶位置之爲要。（五）酒排間中無綫電收音機，可列入爲輔助娛樂之一。</p>

<h3>「吃盡苦中苦方爲人上人」（下）</h3>
<p>— 米同</p>
<p>今日的明星即是昨日的臨時演員</p>
<p>勸君莫失意努力才是成功的途徑</p>
<p>全世界崇拜和羨慕瓊克勞馥的女子，正不知有幾千萬。她們總喜歡說：「我祇要有她的機會，我亦可以闊一下子。」她們摩倣着瓊的樣子梳頭，摩倣着瓊的樣子穿衣服，摩倣着瓊的樣子搽嘴唇，一舉一動都要摩倣她。她們不知道，無論那一個女子，她的成功的機會都　瓊的好，因爲瓊的成爲明星，並不是靠外表的。她的一步一步的上升，是從工作，學習，刻苦，堅持之中得來的。她在倦極的時候，渾身筋骨疼痛的時候，她還是咬緊了牙齒，練習完跳舞。她明白自己學問的缺乏。當她的眼睛被水銀燈照得紅腫的時候，她還不間斷地自己用功讀書。她在做臨時演員的時候，從來不像一般其他做臨時演員的那樣偷閒遊蕩。她在攝影塲中的時候，她摩倣大明星的作風。她回到家裏，就對着鏡子表演，鏡子就是她的不阿附，不奉迎的導師。她將自己的種種，分析解剖着，如同生物學家剖一個新標本一樣。她苛求着尋覓自己的缺點，和糾正補救的方法。她時時刻刻，都在著著上進之中。所以現在的瓊克勞馥，已經不是從前做臨時演員的時候的璧麗凱沁（BiltieCassin）了。但是人家總喜歡說她是個幸運者，她們總喜歡看輕已成功的明星所經歷的千辛萬苦。當然，時勢造成的英雄，並不是没有。但是她們毫不費力地得到了成功，亦會毫不費力地喪失成功的。</p>
<p>現在紅極一時的歌劇明星葛雷絲穆亞，你叫她是幸運造就的嗎？她從一個安樂富有的家庭，逃了出來，不怕父母的不認她，不怕飢餓，不怕失望時候的痛苦，就因爲她立志要做成一個歌劇的明星。她於是住到小公庽裏，白天在小飯店裏唱歌換飯吃，晚上在小戲院裏跳着舞。她一年到頭，跟着不戲班東奔西跑。她還要處處撙節金錢，預備爲日來練習歌劇之用。她慢慢上升，到了喜劇中領班的地位，但是等到她要學歌劇的時候，都城歌劇團的主人，都告訴她：「你的喉嚨不成」。但她却不顧一切，放棄了在喜劇班中已得的優越地位，跑到意大利去専攻歌劇至兩年之久。她兩年之後，回到紐約的時候，已是另一個新人物了。都城歌劇團以及一切愛好高尙音樂的人物，都拜倒在她的裙下了。就因爲她不肯承認失敗。她或者有天賦的歌喉，但是倘使她没有天賦給她的，那種果敢勇毅的魄力，她也就不見能將她的歌喉操練到現在的地位。由此可見天下賦有光榮的歌喉的人很多，但是不怕艱苦去操練它的，就如鳳毛麟角，不可多覯了。</p>
<p>我還可以提到幾個有勇氣的大明星出頭的經過。露絲蔡德頓本來是一個旅行戲班的台柱，但她情願債臺高築了，跑到好萊塢去一試身手。結果她就成了聲片時代，第一個女明星。茂立斯希佛萊在巴黎登臺的時候，接連三晚被看客喝倒采而下臺逃走，但是第四晚他還是照舊登臺，使觀衆爲他站了起來歡呼。克拉克蓋博起先做臨時演員的時候，幾幾乎餓死了，但他堅　决地努力奮鬥，結果居然紅極一時。珍妮蓋諾初到好萊塢的時候，影片公司當局告訴她，她並没有什麽動人之處，還是早些回家的好，但是她說，她一定可以成功的。結果，有志者，事竟成。她的成功，成了影界歷史上的佳話。安娜史丹從前在俄國基夫一家小菜館裏做洗碟子的。但是她决定了學戲，居然能到好萊塢來，做了一鳴驚人的大明星。人家看了漢倫海絲的戲，都說漢倫海絲是有天賦的奇才的。但是她自己却告訴人，她從前刻苦操練的經過，以及在戲劇學校裏所受的種種磨折。人家羨慕琴妮麥唐納的衣着華麗。但是琴妮自己却告訴人，從前她做舞女的時候，同伴的舞女，都笑她穿的棉質的祱衣，而不知道她一個錢却不肯浪費，要節省下來付戲劇學校的學費。結果，她竟脫離了舞女的階級，從前笑她的人，都覺得慚愧無地了。</p>
<p>勇敢，野心，能决斷三個美德！在好萊塢的影業中，亦和在其他各種事業中一樣，是成功的要素。我們應當佩服瓊耐德，一位新進的女星。她小時候自從得過嬰兒癱瘓症之後，人家都說她已是終身的廢人了，但她却不甘自棄，她練習着舞蹈，非但身體强健了，並且成了一位歌舞明星。愛麗絲懷德從一個女記事，一躍而成女明星。再失敗之後，經歷了千辛萬苦，現在已經恢復了從前的地位。葛羅麗亞史璜蓀，從前是兩捲滑稽片中的浴女，居然成了一等紅星。葛雷泰嘉寳是瑞典一家理髮店中的侍役。却利卓别麟是倫敦猶有街上的窮孩子，現在已成了影界的首富了。華雷斯皮萊小時候，是一個看象的象夫。却爾斯賴甫登從前是旅館中的書記。其餘的人，亦就不勝枚舉，都是從刻苦自勵中抬頭起來的。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「野花香」</h3>
<p>KansasOityPrincess</p>
<p>丨大光明映丨</p>
<p>看完了這「野花香」，好像讀了一段被記者不惜紙筆來煊染烘托的「黃色新聞」一樣，呌人不免有「浪費」之感的。</p>
<p>這兒是從兩位修指甲的女郎身邊，展開了劇的故事。露珊愛上了一個靑年流氓狄納，而瑪莉却是個男性玩弄主義者。因爲前者被另一流氓騙去了訂婚戒子，不好對付情人，就和後者化裝了混在女童子軍的専車裏逃往紐約去。可是在下車時偏被狄納趕上了，于是兩人急得跳上一輛汽車，和車中的兩位美國鄕紳打得火熱後，跟着他們上了遠航巴黎的郵船。</p>
<p>狄納呢？也混上船去，替一位往巴黎去找妻子的美國富翁亞藍做了保鏢。在修指甲的機會中又和那兩個女的見了面。</p>
<p>亞藍懷疑自已的太太在巴黎和一位俄國醫生發生曖昧，特請一個巴黎偵探去偵察一下，在偵探來報告說是眞有其事時，就佈置一個美人計，用瑪莉的色相去誘惑醫生來上圈套。</p>
<p>誰料那個偵探却利用他所受的委托去和亞太太勾結，來敲了一筆大竹槓。亞藍在人財兩空之後就愛上了瑪莉，露珊和狄納也結了婚。</p>
<p>這兒繼承着好萊塢影片一般的通病，故事空虚，結搆鬆懈，而結局亦是庸俗的。我們試問如露珊這類的女人怎麽偏愛狄納？而流氓如狄納之流，怎麽會一再地由飛機輪船來拚命地趕着她？旣是彼此愛昨很，那一個又爲什麽在失了戒子之後，就不能說個明白，而要一走了之呢？由于作爲這劇本題材的先决問題，旣是空虚不合理，接着更用些偶然與巧合，如：瑪莉與露珊的遇美國鄕紳帶上船去，亞藍會用突如其來，而似綁匪一樣的人來做保鏢，以及修指甲的重逢，俄國醫生的一誘就來等，都是空想，胡閙，所以弄得所謂「噱頭」也並不怎麽「發噱」了。</p>
<p>如果要從「野花香」中也比較地可以找出些優點的話，那要算是相當地暴露了所謂律師與偵探也者這類人的「狼狽爲奸」了。一方面受人委托，辦理一椿案子，而一方面却利用這案子去勾結對方，反敲竹槓或兩面「吃油餅」這類的事。倒是很現實的。次之如寫修指甲這般的女子，如何用哭與笑去騙去紳士們的錢，和紳士們的如何用錢來玩弄女子等地方，也算是多少有些諷刺着的了。</p>
<p>導演把如前所說那麽空虚的劇本，能够做到這樣，總算是很不容易了。劇中有英，法，美，俄，這四個國籍的人物，導演者能用着不甚誇張的手法表現出各人的性格與習氣等，確是値得稱贊的。其中以美國富紳表現得最充份，俄國醫生的淡淡幾筆，也已寫得頗具輪廓。畫面間的織接與氛圍的處理，也很明快與有旋律。</p>
<p>瓊白郎黛兒的露珊和葛倫檀法萊兒的瑪莉，演來都是同樣的賣力，但比較地說，倒是後者演得更好些。男角以飾亞藍的比飾狄納的演得較自然，較成功，雖是後者比前者要吃重得多。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>看了「重婚」以後</h3>
<p>— 費念祖</p>
<p>「重婚」是一個平凡的故事，可是在演出上却得到了偉大的效果，堪稱一部明星公司相當成功的作品。</p>
<p>當然，題材的現實，結搆的嚴密，固是本片成功的唯一要素，而導演的始終努力，也是不可否認的事實。他那簡潔明快的手法，是値得我們贊許的，尤其是對於劇中人個性的描寫，有着很大的把握，而對於幾個穿揷的噱頭，也顯出相當的聰明：如大學生抱着椅子學習跳舞，以及半夜回校，越墻而入，大胖子失足　入水缸中等，令人捧腹。</p>
<p>演員；高占非在本年中飾一浪蕩子，油腔滑調，另有一派新的作風。高倩蘋飾一嬌生慣養的少女，演來十分逼眞，較之「女兒經」中已有着更大的進步。嚴月閒因化裝不佳，所以没有特殊的成績，可是大體上總算是稱職的。謝雲卿的鄕下老頭兒，維妙維肖，有驚人的成績。</p>
<p>最後我認爲字幕太多，不免是本片中的疵點。</p>
<h3>母女變成了姊妹</h3>
<p>自從「人生」之後，這一位賢母良妻的典型人物林楚還没有新作。最近，有兩部戲已决定由她主演。這自然是人們喜歡聽的消息。</p>
<p>這兩部戲，一是羅明佑朱石麟合導的「國風」，一是羅明佑　穆合導的「天倫」。在這兩部片裏，她都是扮演着母親。</p>

<h3>風流寡婦（The　Merry　Widow）（一）</h3>
<p>— 素華</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品　珍耐麥唐納　希佛萊主演</p>
<p>巍峨的第宅，無生氣地在馬蘇維亞國的一個小鎭裏矗立着。本來在這房子的四圍是無時不充滿着愉快的。可是她丨蘇麗亞已是世上最不快活的一個寡婦了。馬蘇維亞是與世無爭的國家，戰爭是永不會發生的。金錢嗎？蘇麗亞付出的財產捐就是維持國家經濟的命脈。但是可憐的丨丨馬蘇維亞的寡婦！受禮敎縛束着，連出門口也要戴上那又黑又厚的面紗。她無精打采地走到床邊那只燈檯子，打開抽屜拿出她的日記。她一頁頁的翻下去，憂怨的神情同時在她清瘦的面孔上表現着。她揭到了七月二日的那一篇，上面寫着：「親愛的日記，我現在是寡婦了！」再一頁一頁的下去，每頁都祇寫着：「没有什麽値得記的了！」她嘆着氣戴上了面紗就往花園裏去。皎潔的月光的銀輝灑遍了大地。從僕人房裏發出來的醉人音樂，使她坐在那石橙子上靜靜的欣賞。她眼睛望着月兒，口裏唱着歌。當幽怨的歌聲充滿着園地時，忽然給一個男子的歌聲停止了。她急促的望過去，看見一位靑年軍士正爬在墻頭上。她驚惶地站起來，那人已經跳下來了，向她見着禮輕輕的道：「請你不要驚，我們都不是很寂寞嗎？」她剛想喊出來，他就從衣袋裏拿出一封信：「一封重要的信。」他說着遞了給她。她在接信的當兒偷偷地看他。一位年靑的軍人，一副藍眼睛，和一張滑稽的嘴唇。那時他很恭敬的鞠了一躬說：「這是很要緊的信，我要等回音呢。」蘇麗亞就把信拆開，她讀完了，再慢慢的把信讀着：「請你常心着唐爾納，他是很得人驚的。」她想了一會說道：「我不知道唐爾納是誰，」他忙着答道：「他就是唐爾納子爵丨就是我。」蘇麗亞又問：「這信是誰寫的呢？」那人答道：「也是我寫的。」蘇麗亞莫明其妙的說道：「我實在不明白，你到底要些什麽？」「我要的祇是你的回音丨丨」蘇麗亞那時用着含怒的口氣命他立刻離開這裏。她返身就要跑。可是唐爾納阻着她用柔和的聲音，祈求的道「讓我多留一刻吧。」蘇麗亞挺着身子怒視着他道：「我眞不信御衛軍竟······」「敢向最有財勢的女人放恣。他替她續着說。她眞的惱了。他仍是嬉皮笑臉的哀求着道：「讓你來處在我的地位吧，如果你對我說得天花亂墮，而我老是戴着面紗，那末你晚上難道不會因想像我的面貌而致失眠嗎？」蘇麗亞聽了，奮然的推開他，向自屋裏走，可是唐爾納仍舊阻着她，並且請她將面紗除了去。蘇麗亞尊嚴地回答他道：「除去面紗嗎？那可以的，祇是現在還没有除的必要。」她說完了，頭也不回的跑到裏面去了。唐爾納在門外站了一會，整了整衣服，便也大踏步的跟了進去。在樓梯上，蘇麗亞轉過來看這位不速之客。在燈光下，他是英俊不凡，表示自他是馬蘇維亞的男子。他冷談地望着她道：「夫人，我最後一次告訴你，我們的浪漫史是完結了。你再不要想我。連作夢也不要夢着我。」他說完了，道着晚安，鞠着躬就走了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Yin Tong, Chaishan, and Others Confer on Unresolved Matters in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Agreement largely reached on the rotation of security forces.</p>
<p>Yi Wo to leave Ping today to return to Changchun and report.</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, the responsible parties from both China and Japan held discussions at the Beijing Hotel to decide the order of resolving matters in the war zone. The following was decided: (1) The newly formed Special Police Force will move eastward for rotation. (2) The Sun Jizhou unit of the security reinforcement team in the Yutian war zone will be reorganized and relocated to Haiyang Town in Qinhuangdao, to be taken over by the newly formed Special Police Force. (3) Japanese and puppet troops will withdraw from Malanyu Eastern Mausoleums. (4) Malanyu will be returned. (5) The Eastern Mausoleums will be received and placed under custody. (6) Registration and effective protection of Japanese and Korean residents in various places of Luan East. (7) Crackdown on Japanese and Korean rogue organizations trafficking drugs and restrictions on new establishments. (8) Withdrawal of Japanese troops from Jianchangying and Saheqiao outside the pass. The first two items must be implemented after the New Year, and items 2, 6, and 7 must be implemented by mid-February at the latest. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding various outstanding issues in the Hebei war zone, after the principles were decided by the War Zone Clearance Committee, each committee member proceeded separately according to their assigned tasks. Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and others took advantage of Yi Wo's visit to Peiping to discuss everything. Previously, Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Yi Wo, and Chaishan went to Tianjin one after another to meet with Yu Xuezhong to discuss the rotation of security forces in the war zone. As a result, it was decided to coordinate in Peiping. Yi Wo returned to Peiping last night following Chaishan. Yin Tong also arrived in Peiping last night. This morning, Yin Tong, Chaishan, and others went to the Fusang Hotel one after another to visit Yi Wo for talks. Yin Rugeng rushed over from Tianjin this afternoon to participate. The meeting concluded at around 1:00 PM. According to Yi Wo, several matters were discussed this morning: (1) Regarding the entry of the new security forces into the war zone, the number must not exceed 5,000. Heavy weapons such as heavy machine guns must not be carried, and whether light machine guns can be carried is still under discussion. (2) The Yutian local militia dispute should be resolved quickly by North China. The Japanese side also expressed sympathy. (3) Regarding the return of Malanyu, the date will be determined after consultation with the representative of your country. The reason why the Japanese and Manchukuo armies were unable to withdraw immediately is that the barracks in the withdrawal area have not been completed. During today's talks, various issues in the war zone were mentioned. After this consultation, there is a general outline, and unfinished matters still need to be studied at any time. The reorganization of the Eastern Travel Agency is not true, and the continuation of the Ping-Shen train service is even more out of the question. Because I have been away from Yushu for a long time, I will say goodbye to Huang this evening and leave Peiping on the morning of the 25th to return to Yushu, and then transfer to Changchun to meet Commander Nanjirō to report everything. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning at 6:15 AM, Yin Rugeng returned to Peiping from Tianjin. On the evening of the 23rd, Yin had visited Chairman Yu at the provincial government to ask for instructions on the scope of negotiations for the war zone issues. He returned to Peiping specifically this morning to meet with Yi Wo, Chaishan, and others. This morning at 10:00 AM, Yi Wo and Chaishan invited Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, Xu Zi, and Yue Kaixian to meet at the Fusang Hotel in Dongdan Archway, Peiping, to exchange opinions on various issues of war zone clearance. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, Yin Tong, Yi Wo, Chaishan, and Yin Rugeng gathered at the Beijing Hotel to formally discuss the order of resolving various matters in the war zone. After a plan was decided, Yi Wo and Chaishan rushed to Changchun before the New Year to congratulate the new commander of the Kwantung Army, Nanjirō, on his assumption of office, and to present the various plans for approval before returning to implement them. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yi Wo, Chaishan, Yin Tong, and others met at the Fusang Hotel on the morning of the 24th to discuss war zone issues. Yin Rugeng also participated in the discussion after returning to Peiping from Tianjin at noon. A general solution has been decided. The discussion continued in the afternoon. Yi Wo is scheduled to visit Huang Fu in the evening to bid farewell. He will return to Yushu with Harada and others on the morning of the 25th, stay for a short time, and then go to Changchun to meet Kwantung Army Commander Nanjirō to report everything. According to Yi Wo, (1) There are no problems with the unresolved matters in the war zone after the meeting between the two sides, and other minor issues are easy to resolve. (2) The rotation of the new security forces will be limited to 5,000 people, not including the original units. Heavy weapons cannot be carried, and light weapons can be handled with discretion. The departure time has not yet been determined. (3) The Yutian local militia dispute was raised for discussion, and it was decided that the Chinese side would resolve it themselves. Whether the security forces will be transferred has not been determined. (4) The Ping-Yu train service will be handled by the original agency. The report of reorganization is not accurate, and this matter has never been considered. (5) Each port in Changchun has its own customs checkpoint, and recently they have only been in contact with each other. The rumor that there were negotiations on tax matters is also not true. Finally, when asked by reporters about the war zone issues, whether it can be started after this round of talks or whether further discussion is needed, Yi Wo replied that it is difficult to predict at the moment, but it can be asserted that there will be no problem.

<h3>Eastern Travel Agency to Continue Handling Train Service</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ministry of Railways' Political Reorganization Committee and the China Travel Service have decided through consultation that the Eastern Travel Agency will continue to handle the Ping-Shen train service, maintaining the original status. However, the rumor that a three-year contract has been signed is still premature, as the handling time is currently under negotiation and has not been specified. The date of signing the contract is expected to be around the end of the year. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cable Break on Coal Mine Hoist at Kailuan Linxi Mine</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 22nd at the Kailuan Linxi Mine, when hoisting coal from the well using a hoist, the cable suddenly broke due to excessive load just as it neared the wellhead. Dozens of coal containers broke free and fell. Because the well shaft was deep, the workers above the well immediately lay prone and shouted for the workers below to take cover, preventing injuries. However, the well shaft was severely damaged, and the mine bureau announced a three-day suspension of work on the 23rd to repair the well shaft. Last month, 38 workers were killed or injured due to a cable break on the hoist at the mine. Now, another accident has occurred due to a cable break. To prevent future incidents, the mine bureau has ordered the chief engineer to study safe hoist methods. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yuan Liang Returns to Peiping from Beijing</h3>
<p>Discussing the Peiping City Boundary Issue</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang returned to Peiping from Beijing this morning. According to him, his visit to Beijing this time was to discuss the reorganization of cultural relics in the old capital. The Executive Yuan decided to submit the reorganization plan to the relevant ministries and commissions to review it together with me. It was generally approved and then submitted to the Yuan meeting for a decision. The main points were: (1) The organizational regulations of the Old Capital Cultural Relics Reorganization Committee were amended and approved. (2) The originally planned reorganization fund of 3.09 million yuan was approved as is. This fund will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance for 1 million yuan, the Ministry of Railways for 1.09 million yuan, and the remaining amount will be allocated by the Peiping Municipal Government. After the case was decided, contact was resumed with the Ministry of Finance and Railways, and both agreed to faithfully allocate the funds on a monthly basis. The opening period is planned to be carried out as soon as possible to complete it as soon as possible. Before Yu went to Beijing, the Peiping City boundary case was handled by specialists from both the province and the city in accordance with the Yuan Order. Later, because the new members of the Hebei Provincial Government Committee were newly appointed and had not yet taken office, and the Chief Huang and others sent by the Interior Ministry were recalled to Beijing by telegram, it was suspended. At first, I did not expect that there would be a meeting in Beijing. The motivation for the boundary demarcation this time was to comply with the Yuan Order to instruct the province and city to comply. This is the same as the transfer of county jurisdictions in other provinces. There are precedents for how to proceed. Upon arriving in Beijing, Yu received an official letter from the Interior Ministry stating that the Hebei-Peiping boundary demarcation case had been decided by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan and the Military Commission had discussed and determined the principles, which were submitted to the Interior Ministry to convene representatives from the military and political departments, the military branch, the political reorganization committee, and the Hebei-Peiping provinces and cities to discuss. Therefore, a meeting was held in the Ministry on the 8th of this month. At that time, the Peiping city boundary proposed by the Interior Ministry was determined in accordance with the principles discussed and determined by the Yuan, which was slightly smaller than the boundary proposed by this government in the 17th year. Yu believed that since the matter involved changes in administrative areas, the local government should abide by the central government's orders. Therefore, during the meeting, Yu only expressed that he should abide by the principles of the Yuan. As for the representatives of the provincial government, they repeatedly stated that the strength of the urban area was weak and that the jurisdiction should not be enlarged. As for the transfer of the two counties of Da and Wan to the urban area, from the standpoint of the provincial government itself, what major obstacles were there? It was not expressed. The provincial government's consideration for the city government was indeed thorough. Yu only deeply felt that Yu knew better than the representatives of the provincial government how the strength of the urban area was, so it seemed that there was no need to worry about it. The meeting convened by the Interior Ministry did not yield any results. The city government has no prejudices on this matter, and how it will be handled in the future will naturally depend on the central government's leadership. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Mayor of Peiping, Yuan Liang, returned from Beijing at 7:00 AM today, passing through Tianjin without stopping, and went directly to Peiping. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Change of Leadership in Yutian Ya Hongqiao Militia</h3>
<p>Wang Bingxiao taken away by Japanese troops</p>
<p>Lu Mou publicly elected as acting commander</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Bingxiao, the commander of the Yutian Ya Hongqiao militia, was taken away on the morning of the 22nd by Asami, the captain of the Japanese troops in Tangshan, who dispatched more than 20 soldiers in plainclothes to go by car under the pretext of convening a meeting. The local militia lost its leader, causing a major riot. The townspeople publicly elected a Lu Mou to temporarily act as commander to maintain order. On the 23rd, Zhu Shiqin inquired by telephone to the Tangshan Japanese military headquarters, which replied that the team had received a complaint against Wang and had specifically summoned him for interrogation. Merchants and residents of Hongqiao Town feared that the security team would take advantage of the opportunity to besiege them, and fled to neighboring counties on a snowy night to seek temporary refuge. For a time, the order was too chaotic. Also, He Jinjia, the chief of the Ya Hongqiao Public Security Bureau, was also detained by the Tangshan Japanese team leader and questioned overnight before being released on bail on the 23rd to resume his post.

The Sixth District Militia and the He An Team arrived and dispersed them, arresting more than 60 people and sending them to the county government for detention.

For the convenience of international tourists visiting Peiping, a large-scale tour company and museum are also planned to be established. Yingtai in Zhongnanhai will be used as the museum site, and a theater will be built elsewhere, with the aim of preserving and promoting China's inherent theatrical culture. The establishment of the tour company is currently being negotiated for investment by Shanghai Bank and Jincheng Bank. The museum is planned to be located in the Taimiao (Imperial Ancestral Temple). Inside, maps of Peiping and models of various buildings will be displayed as a reference for tourists visiting Peiping. A cultural commodity market will also be set up to control the sale of cultural commodities. The construction cost of the museum is estimated at 300,000 yuan.

<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Weeks Reports</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin Elaborates on Inherent Morality</p>
<p>Ding Chao-wu Reports on the Situation in Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 24th, attended by He Yingqin, Chen Xunyong, Lin Xiang, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, totaling more than 500 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and then gave a detailed elaboration on the relationship between Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings on national rejuvenation and morality. First, he said that morality is inherent in our country and there is no such thing as new or old. In general, it consists of the four characters of courtesy, righteousness, integrity, and shame. The ancients regarded them as the four dimensions of a country. If a country cannot earnestly practice these four characters, there is no one that will not decline. The eight characters of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace, and harmony are extended from the four characters of courtesy, righteousness, integrity, and shame in order to realize world peace. Second, he said that people today have many misunderstandings about the so-called new morality of freedom, equality, etc. Freedom has limits and cannot be exceeded. Equality also has a scope and should be observed. Finally, he said that the Chinese people must deeply understand and practice their inherent morality, and then the nation can have hope of rejuvenation. He also encouraged his colleagues to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, deeply reflect, and not exceed the moral standards in every move. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 162nd memorial week at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 24th, attended by Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Fang Juehui, Zhang Ji, Hong Ludong, Li Zonghuang, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Ding Chao-wu, and all staff members, totaling approximately 500 people. Chairman Ye Chucang and Ding Chao-wu reported on the recent political and military situation in Jiangxi Province, stating briefly that Jiangxi Province has made significant progress in all aspects recently. According to my observation, there are approximately the following points: (1) The reason why the military bandit suppression has progressed so rapidly this time and can eliminate bandit troubles is that the bandit suppression officers and soldiers can cooperate with the people. This is the effective result of the training provided by the military officer corps founded by Chairman Chiang. (2) In terms of politics, it can organize the people and use the people, such as building roads and handling Baojia, etc., to achieve results. (3) In terms of party affairs, it has recently trained workers to run children's remedial education and promoted various new life movement activities, also with success. This progress in Jiangxi Province is because the entire province, from top to bottom, can embrace the three spirits of creativity, construction, and seeking rapid results, and strive to engage in it. It is hoped that the people of the country, whether for the party or the country, should embrace this spirit, and then the nation can be rejuvenated. After the speech, the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Customs in Various Places Investigate and Seize With Unusual Strictness</h3>
<p>No Large-Scale Smuggling Has Been Discovered Recently</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Customs Service, since the prohibition of tax evasion, customs investigations and seizures in various places have been unusually strict. In the past four or five months, smuggling may still be unavoidable, but it is small. Large-scale tax evasion has not been discovered. The reason why the tax revenue has not improved since the change in tax rates this year is actually due to the weak domestic purchasing power and the reduction of imports. The general situation of the tax revenue in the months of July, August, September is actually the same as in the 23rd year. After October, the Tax Service has not yet reported. However, in the past, after October has always been a slow month. The tax revenue after setting up checkpoints along the Great Wall in North China is not very much. However, the purpose of setting up the various checkpoints was originally to prevent smuggling and tax evasion. Since the prohibition of silver exports and the implementation of anti-smuggling, it has been effective. The Tax Service has sent personnel to various customs offices to inspect. Large-scale smuggling has disappeared. If legitimate merchants export silver, they must have a permit from the Ministry. The effect has also been achieved since the recent limit on private carrying. The general public's so-called lack of cash, suspected of being caused by the unabated smuggling, is just speculation. It is indeed true that there is a greater need for cash in the silver market after the autumn harvest and agricultural products are sold into the market. This has always been the custom and cannot be immediately regarded as the impact of too many exports. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Customs has recently been severely affected by the proliferation of smuggled goods, which has greatly impacted the national treasury. It has specially formulated a reward for informants method, notifying merchants and residents to know. If it is seized after being reported, 40% of the auctioned price of the goods will be used as a bonus. It has also instructed the outer class personnel to step up anti-smuggling in order to prevent the import of smuggled goods. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Court to Transfer Key Suspects in Yi Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangning District Court sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court on the 24th requesting that Xiao Xiangpei, a key suspect in the Yi case, be transferred to Beijing for interrogation. According to reports, Xiao was Yi's confidant and was solely responsible for packing and transporting the antiques south. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Luyi said that it is rumored that the court will send personnel abroad to investigate the sale of stolen antiques in order to thoroughly understand the situation after the antiques were stolen and exported. This court has not yet received a notice from the central government to handle the matter, so it is difficult to determine whether personnel will be sent abroad to investigate. The court's investigation of the case is limited to those whom the court intends to impeach. If the impeachment case is established after review, the responsibility for investigation should be borne by the Central Disciplinary Committee and the judicial organs. The candidates for the commissioners of surveillance and the chief auditor are being selected by the president of the Yuan. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Due to the encirclement by local militias in various counties, they fled to Qinghu Mountain in Quyang. The Quyang militia intercepted them and were defeated near Qinghu Mountain. The Yang bandits led the crowd over the ridge and attacked Luojiayu, looting wildly and kidnapping more than 100 men and women. They then fled to Putao Kou. Because the townspeople fled when they heard the news, the bandits burned the entire town in anger and fled to Laiyuan. County Magistrate Hu telegraphed the province, requesting the provincial army to encircle and suppress them. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Russia-Manchukuo Conference on Waterway Issues Concludes</h3>
<p>Delta Issue Unresolved</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Russia-Manchukuo conference on waterway issues has been held in Daheihe since October 9th for a total of 14 times. An agreement on the waterway has now been reached. However, regarding the delta where the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River meet, the Russian side believes it is in Russian territory, while the Manchukuo side believes it is in Manchukuo territory and has protested, demanding the withdrawal of Russians and Russian troops. Because the area is a military stronghold, the Russian side ignored it. This matter could not be resolved. It is heard that Horiuchi, the Japanese chairman of the Manchukuo delegation to the waterway conference, is scheduled to depart for Harbin on the 27th. (24th China United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Detains Japanese Officers on the Banks of the Ussuri River</h3>
<p>Suspected of Espionage for Secretly Photographing Terrain</p>
<p>Sent to Border Defense Headquarters for Interrogation</p>
<p>(Moscow) A new incident has occurred on the Russo-Manchurian border, further complicating the Japanese-Russian dispute. An investigation is currently underway. According to a telegram from Khabarovsk to the government, Soviet Russian officials are investigating the actions of a Japanese military officer and a "Manchukuo" soldier who were suddenly discovered in a small border village called Volkovo-Nikolskoye. It is alleged that the Japanese officer was taking photographs in the village while the "Manchukuo" soldier was recording notes nearby. Both men have been detained by local Soviet Russian authorities. Soviet Russian officials claim that the officer was carrying a military saber and a pistol, as well as a camera and several unused film rolls. Additionally, a photographic map of the vicinity was found, detailing the geographical features of the Russo-Manchurian border, along with a notebook written in Japanese. According to the two men, they crossed the border in search of a five-year-old child and two farmers who had also crossed the border and were detained by Soviet Russian authorities. The two men are currently being held locally pending orders from Moscow. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Khabarovsk, December 21st. A Japanese military officer and his attendant were detained by Soviet forces on the banks of the Ussuri River in the village of Verkhni Spasskoye, 30 kilometers south of Iman. They entered the home of a collective farmer, Kovalev, seeking a drink, and then proceeded to the center of the village. The officer began taking photographs while his attendant recorded notes on paper. Upon detention, the officer was found to be carrying a bayonet and a pistol, a camera and five rolls of film, and a military satchel containing a topographical map of the Sino-Soviet border annotated in Japanese, as well as a Japanese notebook. The attendant was also carrying a bayonet. According to the Japanese officer, he crossed the border in search of a seven-year-old child who had escaped from a Chinese thatched house (opposite Verkhne-Nikolskoye village) a few days prior. He was also searching for a Korean and a Chinese person who had been detained by Soviet border guards a week earlier. The Japanese officer has been transported by automobile to the Border Defense Headquarters for further interrogation. (TASS Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>General Minami Jiro Explains Policy Toward Manchuria</h3>
<p>Visits Ugaki in Korea En Route</p>
<p>Seoul: Before arriving in Seoul on the 23rd, the Commander of the Kwantung Army, Minami Jiro, expressed his aspirations in the car, stating that his ambition upon assuming his post is to achieve complete emotional and economic integration between Japan and Manchuria. He is determined to dedicate his efforts to this goal. The reason for passing through Korea is twofold: Firstly, Manchuria and Korea share a border, and cooperation is impossible without mutual understanding. Therefore, he must meet with Governor-General Ugaki for earnest discussions. Secondly, as the end of the year approaches, he is eager to assume his post. "Manchukuo" is an independent nation inseparable from Japan. This goes without saying. It is Japan's national policy to maintain close contact with this friendly nation in terms of politics, economy, security, and transportation, and to provide guidance. It is the duty of those on the ground to fully consult with "Manchukuo" on this matter. Close contact, in other words, means that without complete and comprehensive interaction between the Japanese and Manchurian peoples, problems such as the influx of Korean farmers into Manchuria may arise. He has been thoroughly studying this issue and intends to openly exchange views with Governor-General Ugaki. The Governor-General is a dedicated researcher, and he may have considerable insights. In short, provided that both parties proceed from the perspective of desiring the sound development of "Manchukuo," there is no doubt that mutual understanding will be established. Furthermore, he questions whether it is appropriate to rely solely on swords and guns to protect the border with this inseparable independent nation. While security may be necessary, such a confrontational atmosphere is unpleasant. He intends to convey his views to the Governor-General on this matter. The Chientao region is policed by Korean troops because Koreans account for half of the population there. Therefore, the demarcation of the area between Japan and Manchuria has been proposed. When he was the Commander of the Korean Army, he firmly believed that the solution to the Asian continental problem lay in the Chientao issue. However, after the Manchurian Incident, administrative changes have occurred. At present, the continental problem can only be resolved with the sound and long-term development of "Manchukuo." Extraterritoriality inevitably poses an obstacle to the harmony between the Japanese and Manchurian peoples, and it is necessary to remove this obstacle. (Dentsu Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The 67th Session of the Japanese Diet Convenes</h3>
<p>Hamada of the Seiyukai Party Elected Speaker of the House</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 67th session of the Diet convened today. This is the first ordinary session of the Diet under the Okada Cabinet. The Seiyukai's explosive motion in the previous extraordinary session clearly demonstrated its attitude towards the government. It is uncertain what actions they will take this time as an opposition party, and the government cannot be optimistic. The election of the speaker today has attracted much attention. However, the year may pass peacefully. The atmosphere will certainly become tense when the Diet reconvenes early next year, as the Seiyukai plans to pressure the government to submit supplementary budget requests. In that case, the government may have to dissolve the Diet. According to government sources, if the government advocates dissolution, the Seiyukai's attitude will soften. Despite some twists and turns, the Diet can achieve a satisfactory outcome. (Domei Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The ordinary session of the Diet convened at 9:00 AM today. After the House of Peers determined the selection of chairmen and directors for each faction, it notified the government and the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives convened at 10:00 AM. Due to the resignation of Speaker Akita, the speaker was elected today. The Seiyukai nominated Hamada Kunimatsu as its candidate. The Minseito Party refused the Seiyukai's request for cooperation and nominated its own member as a candidate. As a result, Hamada was elected with an absolute majority. (Domei Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Hamada Kunimatsu, who was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives today, made the following statement:</p>
<p>Regarding the proper utilization of the system of continuing committees or newly established standing committees, this has been my long-standing belief. I intend to make every effort to obtain the consent of the House of Peers and strive to realize this. As for the administrative branch, in light of the current situation, if the National Policy Deliberation Council is deemed necessary, then such an agency must also be established within the legislature, the Diet. I believe this is the natural trend. (Domei Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan Revitalizes Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Establishes Foreign Ministry Advisory Council</p>
<p>To Serve as Consultation for the Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously established a System Efficiency Renovation Committee, with Vice Minister Shigemitsu as chairman and Treaty Bureau Director Kuriyama as vice-chairman, and the most senior section chiefs of each bureau as members. The committee is researching reforms to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' current system, as well as specific plans to improve efficiency. Once concrete plans are formulated, they will be implemented immediately. The system of roving ambassadors, which was previously decided upon, was also a product of this committee. This time, the Ministry will further establish, through internal regulations, a council of senior envoys currently in the country or awaiting assignment, to meet regularly once a month, listen to reports from executives on the progress of important diplomatic issues, exchange opinions, and answer inquiries from the Foreign Minister. The reason for establishing this council is to give it the function of a military council of senior officers from various military branches. In addition, the Kasumigaseki Association, an organization composed of current and former high-ranking officials, lacks organized function. Therefore, it is planned to reorganize its external organization, much like a veterans' association. Foreign Minister Hirota is shifting from the previous emphasis on improving overseas legations to prioritizing the improvement of domestic agencies to determine diplomatic policy. He intends to use the aforementioned advisory and auxiliary bodies, in addition to the Ministry, to thoroughly convey the Ministry's policy to the public while also reflecting the public's intentions in diplomacy.

<h3>Japanese Red Scare</h3>
<p>Mass Arrests of Communists in Aichi Prefecture</p>
<p>Fifty-Eight Indicted</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news ban on the communist movement incident in Aichi Prefecture has been lifted today. The communist movement in the prefecture was organized around Mr. Tatsuo Iwata in June of last year, establishing the Nagoya District Council of the National Council. Party members were ordered to infiltrate various important factories to conduct activities. After discovering this, the police authorities began investigations at 9:00 PM on February 24th of this year, arresting 1725 people. As a result of the investigation, 58 of them were indicted under the Maintenance of Public Order Law. (Dentsu Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Galashevsky, the Soviet representative in the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations, visited Mr. Togo, the Director of the Asian Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, at 2:00 PM on the 24th. He held discussions regarding the details, based on instructions from his government, and then departed. (Domei Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>The Palace Museum Theft Case Must Be Strictly Punished</h3>
<p>The Palace Museum theft scandal, which has caused an uproar both domestically and internationally, has already been fully investigated by the court and has been prosecuted. However, the defendants, Yi Peiji, Li Zongtong, and others, have consistently refused to appear in court. Their guilt is evident, and no amount of justification can acquit them. As high-ranking officials of the state, the fact that Yi and his accomplices engaged in embezzlement and theft already constitutes an inexcusable crime. Moreover, taking advantage of the emergency situation in North China and engaging in looting amidst the chaos makes their actions even more unforgivable.</p>
<p>The treasures of the Palace Museum represent the embodiment of the efforts of our ancestors. Some are helpful for scholarly research, while others are beneficial for historical verification. The essence of thousands of years of careful preservation, untouched by floods, fires, or war, has been reduced to nothing through the theft, sale, and embezzlement by a small number of individuals. The impact on the nation's culture and the harm to the national spirit are immense. Therefore, the crimes of Yi and his cohorts are many times more egregious than those who desecrate ancestral graves and steal treasures. The government has recently increased the penalties for grave robbers and bandits who hold firearms and act in groups of three or more, sentencing them to death. Those who make grave robbing a regular occupation are also sentenced to life imprisonment. However, Yi and his accomplices, sheltered by the concessions and foreign extraterritorial rights, are able to live comfortably and carefree. If this matter is not strictly investigated, how can national discipline be enforced and justice be served in this era?</p>
<p>Yi and his accomplices were initially pursued by the High Court, impeached by the Control Yuan, and subsequently prosecuted by the Jiangning District Court and thoroughly investigated by the Central Political Council, and most recently investigated by the Central Antiquities Preservation Association. If they were not guilty of embezzlement and theft, they could have come forward and defended themselves in court to prove their innocence. However, they have not done so, which indicates their guilt. Furthermore, even if they had acted out of temporary private desires and committed this inappropriate act, they could have confessed their crimes afterward, returned the stolen goods, and perhaps the people of the country would have been willing to offer them a chance to start anew amidst their unforgivable deeds. However, they have been blinded by greed and have never considered doing so. After the incident came to light, they only knew how to exploit the concessions and foreign extraterritorial rights, as well as the provision in criminal procedure law that prohibits judgments in absentia, refusing to respond to summonses in order to delay the pronouncement of their sentences. Recently, there have been reports that Yi himself has fled to the puppet state of Manchukuo, further revealing the insidious nature of his intentions.</p>
<p>We have also heard that a portion of the stolen antiquities had been shipped to France for secret sale. However, due to a lack of secrecy, the plan failed. The items were discovered by customs officials in Marseille and have been detained ever since. In late October, newspapers in both the North and South reported that Xiao Yu, the former director of the Beiping Agricultural Experiment Station, was the mastermind behind the operation. However, Xiao has recently issued notices in the newspapers vehemently denying the allegations and proclaiming his innocence. Xiao Yu was previously accused of colluding with Yi Peiji to embezzle public funds and was a co-defendant with Yi in a case prosecuted by the Jiangning District Court. Although there was no mention of him conspiring with Yi to steal treasures at that time, there is no doubt about the close relationship between him and Yi. As for the fact that antiquities were seized in France, the Central Antiquities Preservation Association has obtained many pieces of conclusive evidence. The truth will eventually come to light. However, we are unwilling to comment further until the truth is clarified. Regarding the theft case, Xiao Xiangpei and Liu Guang'e have been arrested and brought to justice. We hope that the central government will take swift and effective measures to arrest all the key perpetrators of the case, ensuring that none escape. Those who are hiding in the concessions or have fled abroad should be extradited and punished accordingly. Xiao Yu is a suspect and a co-defendant in the embezzlement case, and he should not be treated lightly either.</p>
<h3>Countries Worldwide Celebrate Christmas</h3>
<p>British King Hosts Feast for 700 Poor People in Palace</p>
<p>Germany also hosts 12,000 Poor Children</p>
<p>Austria Pardons Over 6,000 Political Prisoners</p>
<p>Train Collisions and Plane Crashes in United States</p>
<p>Bethlehem: The entire world will celebrate Christmas tonight via radio. This great church has meticulously arranged for the broadcasting of various ceremonies. In the center of the church is a replica of the Holy Grotto, said to be built on the site where Jesus was born. The service will begin at midnight. The small town has been visited by thousands of pilgrims from all over the world, including Abyssinian Christians, Anglo-Saxons, Armenians, Roman Catholics, and members of various denominations, all wearing different attire and speaking different languages. Many have come from Germany, including many expelled Jews. As for Italy, due to the convenience of the newly established direct air route to Palestine, many have also come. This year's celebration emphasizes prosperity. In the past, female pilgrims would trudge through the dust on foot, but now they travel by vehicles. This year, there are two newly built roads, and pilgrims mostly travel on new public buses or in their own cars. The newly built roads are lit with electric lights, extending from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. The locals are also dressed more lavishly than in previous years. In addition, one other thing reflects prosperity: the mayor of Bethlehem will also participate in the service. Bethlehem will also hold its first mayoral election this year. In the past few weeks, Christian churches throughout Palestine have spared no effort in decorating and arranging, with the wealthy Armenians being the most extravagant. Female pilgrims have been arriving from Jerusalem in a continuous stream, all hoping to enter the Holy Grotto, but the Holy Grotto is very small, only accommodating six people at a time. Therefore, most female pilgrims can only catch a glimpse of the Holy Grotto before returning. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>London: Christmas 1934, regardless of the weather, is certainly a happy holiday in England, as stores, railways, and transportation businesses across the country are reporting exceptionally brisk business. According to a report from the Bank of London, the amount of currency in circulation has now reached £402,000,000, which is the highest figure since 1921. In comparison, the amount of currency in circulation during Christmas 1932 was £370,000,000, and in 1933 it was £390,000,000. This year, the supply of goods is abundant and cheaper than last year. Major stores in London are displaying attractive goods, and business is excellent. The same is true in Manchester and other parts of the North. The thick fog of yesterday has dissipated today, but the weather is unusually mild for this time of year, with no snowy Christmas scenes of the past. Today, the British King is hosting a Christmas tea party at Buckingham Palace, inviting 700 poor people, as per tradition. The London Police Department's Detective Squad has a light workload due to the holiday, so only 25 of the 500 officers are on duty at the station. However, in case of an emergency, 300 officers can be summoned within ten minutes. The situation in Warsaw is not so peaceful. The Warsaw police today arrested 200 notorious thieves and imprisoned them for ten days. However, the police donated funds to purchase food and drink for them, allowing them to spend a happy New Year in prison. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vienna: To celebrate Christmas, the Austrian government today released over 6,000 Social Democrats and National Socialists held in detention centers.

(Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Vienna: The government issued an amnesty decree for Christmas, granting amnesty to all political prisoners arrested for participating in the Social Democratic uprising in February who have not yet been tried. Two thousand political prisoners were released from prison last week.

<p>Moscow: Anti-Christian movements have started again here and throughout Soviet Russia this Christmas. However, the slogans of this year's anti-religious movement seem to be milder than in previous years, merely stating, "Christmas is nothing more than an unconscious emotional reaction, and all educated workers should not participate." The anti-God movement is still the vanguard of the entire anti-Christian movement. Well-trained propaganda teams are making major efforts this year, using anti-religious films and speeches. There is no remote village that has not been touched by their presence. In addition, there are so-called anti-religious travel exhibitions, organized by members of countless anti-God groups. They adopt a more radical attitude and take the form of stormtroopers, making a great impact in Moscow and its suburbs. However, despite such enthusiastic anti-religious propaganda throughout the country, the annual Christmas holiday is still widely observed and celebrated by the people for a week, beginning today.

<p>Paris: On Thursday night, the German Ministry of Defense was heavily guarded, and the National Socialist Party was conducting a purge. It is estimated that no less than 3,000 people have been arrested and interrogated in the past three weeks. After this news arrived from Germany, newspapers here reprinted it, but they could not understand the reasons for the Ministry of Defense's lockdown and the purge. The newspapers also said, "Why have so many people been implicated in secret documents over the past three weeks? Is this action related to the will of Ernst, who was shot on June 30th?" The Morning Post stated, "Everyone in Germany is worried about what events will occur in Germany after the Saar vote on January 13th. Perhaps there will be some action to deal with the opposing forces of Protestantism, or perhaps the Special Task Force will be reorganized to reduce its power. All of this is unknown. In short, cabinet members are not leaving Berlin on Christmas Day, which shows that this holiday is extremely serious and of great importance." (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in Germany</h3>
<p>The National Defense Force Considers Itself the Pillar of the State</p>
<p>The Party Army Is Not Content to Be Second</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German authorities, especially the National Defense Force, seem to be expressing considerable concern about the domestic political situation. Although officials have issued statements to reassure the public, the public's anxieties have not been allayed. Since the National Socialist Party's purge on June 30th, the National Defense Force has become the "military pillar of the Third Germany." Even Hitler himself has said this. However, the Party Army, the Stormtroopers, is not content to be second and is determined not to recognize that the National Socialist revolutionary movement has come to an end. As for the National Socialist Party's Security Force, it has risen to a prominent position since the June 30th incident and intends to consolidate its position. However, the National Defense Force aims to monopolize military power and will not allow the Security Force to act on its own. As a result, these three military organizations are engaged in internal strife. It is widely rumored that since the beginning of this month, the National Defense Force has taken various measures, such as canceling Christmas leave for soldiers. On Thursday evening, the area around the Ministry of Defense was heavily guarded, as if to prevent an incident from occurring. The uneasy attitude of the leaders of the National Defense Force is evident from this. In addition, the German political police are currently conducting a new purge, arresting large numbers of party members. Although officials are keeping silent about the number of arrests, it is estimated to be in the thousands. The reasons for the arrest of some party members are said to be related to morality, similar to what was seen during the June 30th incident. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>People of the Saar Trek Thousands of Miles to Vote from North and South America</h3>
<p>Warmly Welcomed</p>
<p>Saarbrücken: Today, 350 people from the Saar returned from North and South America to participate in the plebiscite. The public welcomed them warmly, in stark contrast to their attitude towards the international forces. When they emerged from the station, cheers erupted, and they raised their arms in salute to the National Socialist Party. However, in accordance with the Saar Commission's ban, they did not display any flags. If they vote in favor of Germany on January 13th, their travel expenses will be reimbursed by local Saar organizations. The headquarters of the German Front violated the ban and displayed flags as usual. Last night, the police intervened and removed them. The lightest punishment for violating the order is three days of detention or a fine of 300 francs. Today, the last batch of Italian soldiers of the international forces also arrived, and the residents remained indifferent to them. (Reuters Telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>French Parliament Adjourns</p>
<h3>Premier's Speech: Out with the Old, In with the New</h3>
<p>Parliament and Government Trust Each Other</p>
<p>Respecting the Spirit of Republican Tradition</p>
<p>Both Houses Pass the Full Budget</p>
<p>(Paris) The order to adjourn Parliament has been announced in the Chamber of Deputies, thus ending the extraordinary session of Parliament for 1934. The regular session of Parliament for 1935 will begin on January 8th. Premier Flandin expressed his gratitude to the Chamber of Deputies at the opening, saying that the success of the government's proposed plans was largely due to the assistance of the Chamber. Speaker Bouisson also delivered a speech of thanks. It was not until 9:50 PM that the Premier read out the adjournment order. Before reading the adjournment order, Premier Flandin delivered a speech to the Chamber of Deputies, stating, "Parliament and the government trust each other. We are able to respect the spirit of republican tradition and to consider the supreme interests of the country. The people of the whole country can truly be comforted by this phenomenon as the end of the year approaches. Moreover, the restoration of normal economic activity depends entirely on the confidence of the people. Seeing the political situation as it is, a sense of trust will naturally arise. The government, on its part, will also have a sense of confidence as a result. From now on, we will be able to handle domestic and foreign affairs, as well as the problem of unemployment, with ease. After the opening of the regular session of Parliament in 1935, the government will meet with Parliament with various new bills in accordance with its announced policies. I hope you will provide assistance. As this year draws to a close, let us get rid of the old and bring in the new. We hope that, whether in domestic or international affairs, we can be guided by human sympathy, solidarity, and a desire for progress, to oppose war and eliminate human suffering," and so on. The Premier's speech was very well received by the members of Parliament.</p>
<p>After the full budget for 1935 was passed on its third reading by the Chamber of Deputies, it was also passed by the Senate. However, there were some points on which the Senate's views differed significantly from those of the Chamber. It was immediately sent back to the Chamber of Deputies, where it was passed on its fourth reading by a vote of 466 to 120.</p>
<p>It was then sent back to the Senate for review. Recently, the Senate reaffirmed its passage by a vote of 184 to 11. According to the budget, the expenditure portion is 47,817,011,976 francs, and the revenue portion is 46,991,968,737 francs. The difference between revenue and expenditure is a deficit of approximately 825,043,239 francs. In addition, the bill on clarifying the wheat market, after being slightly amended by the Chamber of Deputies, was passed. The amended provisions were accepted by the Senate Finance Committee and have recently been passed by the Senate. Furthermore, the Senate passed two other bills, one on the budget for the colony of Algeria, and the other stipulating that the Matignon Palace, the former site of the Austro-Hungarian Embassy before the European War, should be the office of the Prime Minister. Finally, the wine bill was discussed, and the two houses continued to discuss it until they agreed, before announcing the adjournment order. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Simon Invites French Premier to Visit London</h3>
<p>But Says It's Too Early</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Simon went to Nice in the south of France to spend Christmas. On his way to Paris, he took the opportunity to meet with Foreign Minister Laval, as reported in yesterday's telegram. According to the Echo de Paris, Simon invited French Premier Flandin to visit London in January next year during the talks at the Foreign Ministry residence. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Following British Foreign Secretary Simon's discussions with Foreign Minister Laval here the day before yesterday on the issue of the League of Nations, there were rumors that Laval would soon be traveling to London. However, those responsible have denied this, saying that while it is highly likely that Laval will go to London, it will not happen in the short term, as he will be traveling to Rome to visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and is currently focusing on completing preliminary talks.

<h3>America Takes a Calm Attitude, Japan Expresses Satisfaction</h3>
<p>Britain Has Not Received American Cooperation Proposal</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The American government advised the American people on the 21st to avoid making provocative statements. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the following statement today regarding this issue. The Foreign Ministry has not yet received its official telegram. The actions of the American government are timely and</p>
<p>appropriate. Over the past year, the Foreign Ministry has been in contact with the Army, Navy, and Interior Ministry to avoid publishing belligerent or unfriendly articles or publications. In the current London preparatory talks, the Japanese representatives have not uttered a single provocative word. However, from across the Pacific, we often hear inflammatory statements, such as "If Japan abandons the Washington Treaty, the United States will strengthen the defense of the Pacific islands," "The United States is currently planning to build 40 warships," "If Japan builds three ships, the United States will build five," "Implement the strengthening of aircraft to deal with enemy submarines in the Pacific," and so on. Furthermore, Mr. Wien Sun's statement announcing the construction of the Nicaragua Canal is extremely provocative to the feelings of the Japanese people. Now that the London preparatory talks are about to be finalized, all responsible persons should be careful in making statements. The American representatives' remarks to journalists on the night of the 20th caused the Japanese public to feel extremely unpleasant. The Japanese sincerely welcome the American government's recent ban on general provocative statements. (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) According to American newspapers, the US State Department is currently drafting a naval agreement between Britain and the United States. Regarding this matter, well-informed British sources stated that they have not received any formal information from Washington to prove that this news is accurate, and that any draft naval agreement between the two sides, or a plan to establish a united front, is definitely not something that Britain can endorse. The goal of the London Naval Conference was originally to study whether a general naval treaty could be extended or amended. Therefore, what Britain is striving for in the naval field is only to conclude a general agreement, and nothing else is known. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Mail, the British government is now planning to find a way to bring representatives of the naval powers together again in London next spring to discuss. According to the British, the aim of the recent attempt was to obtain a method agreed upon by all countries for monitoring naval armaments in the future. Britain maintains its original position that all naval shipbuilding plans must be publicly announced. Foreign Secretary Simon is currently spending the Christmas holiday in Cannes, France. Japanese Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira will visit him after his return to discuss the matter. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Matin reported that, after the news of Japan's announcement to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty was confirmed, Washington and London immediately exchanged views. American Ambassador to Britain Bingham has now returned home. Upon his arrival in Washington, he discussed with Secretary of State Hull for two hours. The American government also clearly expressed the outline of the policies it should adopt in future negotiations yesterday afternoon, divided into six points: (1) Adopt a cautious attitude to avoid stimulating Japanese nationalism; (2) Britain and the United States should cooperate closely on all issues in the Far East; (3) This cooperation should also be used to resist Japan's demand for naval equality; (4) The United States will build warships so that its naval strength can reach the limits permitted by the current naval treaty; (5) The results of negotiations between Britain and the United States on cooperation should be kept secret from both the press and the public; (6) Continue diplomatic negotiations with Japan to find a way to maintain the current 5:5:3 ratio. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Journal's foreign edition published an article by the renowned journalist Saint-Brice on the Washington Naval Treaty, saying that if the Washington Naval Treaty continued to exist, according to the ratio stipulated in the treaty, Britain and the United States could build 90,000 tons of navy each year, Japan could build 55,000 tons, and France and Italy could each build 40,000 tons. The British navy has already been reduced to the minimum limit below which it cannot be dispensed with, and now it cannot accept the general reduction of naval tonnage by various countries. Its attitude is strange. The article concluded that if the political competition among the powers does not disappear, then all negotiations on armament issues will not easily produce results. The failure of the Washington Treaty and the collapse of the London Naval Conference are all due to this. It is hoped that lessons will be learned from this, and that it will be known that political issues are important, then it may be possible. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Dollar Devaluation Issue</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Refuses to Continue Inflation</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas told the Associated Press today that the issue of dollar devaluation will be the most important point of contention in the next Congress. However, the forces opposing further devaluation by the government are also gradually developing. It is said that the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board are currently drafting legislation to consolidate political control over the Federal Reserve System. This move will further advance the government's political control over bank lending. Some experts believe that the government can therefore raise prices, lower the value of currency, and reduce the national debt. (National Electric, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and New Deal congressmen have decided to oppose inflation and veterans' bonus bills, but will compromise on the 30-hour work week demanded by labor unions.

American Veterans Association President Bergeruno declared that he will submit a bonus bill when Congress convenes, estimating that approximately $2,000,000,000 to $200,000,000,000 in cash will be paid out immediately in veterans' bonus bonds.

<h3>Japan's Railway Policy in "Manchukuo"</h3>
<p>The Beihei-Chenggong-Tumen Line Opens</p>
<p>Three Additional Lines Planned, Including Mishan Line</p>
<p>Soviet Union Responds with Railway Policy</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Company is directly responsible for guiding the "Manchukuo" railway policy, which has been gradually implemented since last year. To date, two major lines have achieved results:</p>
<p>(1) The northern end of the Huhai Railway, a railway from Bei'an Town via Chenqing and Aigun to Daheihe, was completed on December 14th. The track laying work was completed, and the first full-line test run began on the same day.</p>
<p>(2) The line from the Tumen River bank terminus of the Jihui Railway, via Lishugou and Ning'an, crossing the Chinese Eastern Railway at Mudanjiang, to Ningbei, is also gradually being completed. It has now begun temporary operations.</p>
<p>The Beihei Line is an extension of the Huhai Line and the Qitao and Sitao Lines. From an economic perspective, it will completely control the production of the Heilongjiang Plain in the future. Both agricultural and forest products will be absorbed by this line. Before this line was open, it would take a week to travel by boat from Harbin to Daheihe in the summer. Now, it only takes twenty hours. It can also connect with the Jihui Line via the Harbin-Lafa Railway and depart from the North Korean port of Chongjin, which is more convenient and faster than going to Dalian via the South Manchuria Railway. It also surpasses part of the benefits of the Chinese Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>From a military perspective, everyone recognizes that Daheihe, facing the Heilongjiang River and backed by the Lesser Khingan Mountains, is a future key point in Japanese-Soviet military affairs. On the Japanese side, if the Red Army is allowed to cross the river from here and cross the Lesser Khingan Mountains, then the entire Heilongjiang province will not be secure, and "North Manchuria" will inevitably be seized. On the contrary, if Japan crosses the river from Daheihe, seizes Hailanpao, and cuts off the connection between Vladivostok and Chita, then the coastal province and northern Sakhalin Island will be under Japanese control. Therefore, it is actively completing this railway. In the event of an emergency, it can connect with Daheihe from the South Manchuria Railway via the Sitao and Qitao lines, and on the other hand, it can land from Chongjin, go through Dunhua, Lafa, Harbin, and Hulan, and head north. From this, we can see how important this line is.</p>
<p>Although the line from the Tumen River bank to Ningbei is only 250 kilometers long, it passes through the prosperous areas of eastern "Manchukuo." Even in its current undeveloped state, the accumulated goods along the line (grains and forest products) are over 100,000 tons. Therefore, this is a nurturing line for the newly opened ports in northern Korea. In the future, when the port is opened, the land there will be developed, and the economic benefits will be more than ten times what they are today. Moreover, this line will soon be extended to Yilan (the central area for Japanese immigration to "Manchukuo"), absorbing the agricultural production along the Songhua River. The mission of the former Chinese Eastern Railway will probably be reduced by half, and the convenience of Japanese immigration will be further increased. After transportation becomes more convenient, perhaps the transplanted farmers will no longer flee back to Japan. Although its military significance is not as great as that of the Beihei Line, its role in cutting off the Chinese Eastern Railway and controlling eastern Jilin is not small.</p>
<p>This December, it is planning to invest another 40 million Japanese yen to start building three lines: Mishan to Linkou, Solun to Tuquan, and Ripingjie to Si'an County (under Liaoning, formerly known as Dageta). The last line has considerable economic significance, but the military connection is not very significant. However, the first two lines are important locations. Mishan is an important town in eastern Jilin, and Solun is a key point in the southern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains. Such an arrangement not only has a passive defensive meaning, but especially the Solun-Tuquan line, will naturally connect with the Sitao line. Its extension into Outer Mongolia is also anticipated. Therefore, although the Soviet Union is willing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway in the hope of exchanging it for peace, it also knows that this is unreliable. At the same time, the radical public opinion in Japan advocates that if the Soviet Union wants peace, it must withdraw from Eastern Siberia and Outer Mongolia and be controlled by Japan to avoid conflict. The Soviet Union must be vigilant in this regard. Therefore, in addition to its Second Five-Year Plan, it has the following important railway plans: (1) Building a new Siberian Transcontinental Railway as a second transportation line in case the eastern line of the Siberian Railway cannot be used; (2) The Siberian Grand Railway, originally a single-track railway, can no longer fulfill the task of promoting its national industrialization, and is particularly inconvenient militarily. Therefore, double-track railways will be laid in the future to facilitate traffic; (3) All areas bordering northern "Manchukuo" will be sensitive to Japan's aggressive railway policy. Consequently, the construction of a dense railway network within Soviet territory, goes without saying, is heavily military in nature. From the railway policies of both sides, it can be seen that their wartime preparations are still very active. (December 18th, Dalian)</p>
<h3>Security Issues in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Bandit Troubles Need to be Eliminated Urgently</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: Security issues in the war zone have not yet been resolved. The crux of the problem lies in two points: (1) Disputes over the number of personnel and firearms in the newly formed security teams; (2) The reorganization of the security teams and the problem of suppressing the remnants of bandits. It is undeniable that the security teams in the war zone were formed temporarily during the recovery of the war zone, and those recruited had been temporarily enlisted. The command is not unified, and the training has not been perfected. In addition, the strength is insufficient, so it cannot be suppressed on a large scale. Therefore, problems arise frequently. Unless the reorganization is strengthened and the strength is increased to eliminate the remnants of bandits and block all ports to eliminate the source of chaos, the security of the war zone cannot be discussed. The authorities are aware of this and are training new security teams on the one hand and stipulating fundamental solutions on the other hand. However, the Japanese are picky about this matter in many ways, and it has not been realized. The number of security teams stationed within the war zone can reach 9,000 according to the Tanggu Agreement, and there is no restriction on the weapons they carry. However, the Japanese, regardless of the agreement, have always insisted that the number of personnel should not exceed 6,000, and in addition to rifles, not to mention artillery, even machine guns are prohibited from being carried. This has led to the inability of the newly formed security teams to enter the war zone, and the security problem cannot be resolved. Recently, conflicts have broken out again between the Yutian Security Team and the militia, and the local area has been ravaged again. The authorities are urgently seeking a thorough solution in order to achieve lasting results. On the one hand, they are mediating the disputes between the teams to address the symptoms, and on the other hand, they are engaging in earnest negotiations with the Japanese to address the root causes. The War Zone Clearing Committee is working hard and has been in contact with Chai Shan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, ​​through Zhu Shiqin, Yin Tong, and Yin Rugeng. A meeting was held the day before yesterday, but there was no significant result. Yesterday, Zhu Shiqin went to Tianjin from Peiping to visit Yu Xuezhong to negotiate everything. The two sides in Yutian are still confronting each other, and the situation is serious and needs to be resolved urgently. After Zhu's consultation with Yu in Tianjin, he will transfer to Tangshan and go to Yutian to first seek a temporary end to the current dispute. The fundamental issue will then be addressed in Peiping with representatives from the Japanese side to find a fair solution. Chai Shan went to Tianjin yesterday to discuss a certain issue. At 6 pm today, he and Yoshida, the Japanese foreign affairs commissioner who transferred from Changchun via the west, arrived in Peiping to negotiate.</p>

<h3>Implementing Standard Pricing in Beiping</h3>
<p>Trial Implementation Achieves Excellent Results</p>
<p>Elimination of Unsavory Business Practices Foreseeable</p>
<p>The Beiping Branch of the National Goods Bank of China and the Beiping Municipal Government, in a recent effort to promote the increasing prosperity of commerce in Beiping, have resolved to decisively eradicate the unsavory practice of haggling prices among various shops. The initial reform measure involves the implementation of standard market prices. Starting on the first of this month, a trial implementation was conducted at the Dong'an Market, yielding excellent results. Subsequently, on the sixteenth of this month, it was extended to the Xidan Market. It is now learned that starting from New Year's Day next year, all shops city-wide will uniformly adopt standard pricing. Details of the implementation process and its benefits are recorded below:</p>
<p>Motivation for Implementation　In Beiping, for shop-front transactions, prior to a decade ago, the virtue of "no second price" was still upheld. Instances of deviation were few, and even then, limited to stall vendors, who, operating on small capital, sought only to move their goods for quicker turnover. The hardships they faced were well-known to seasoned observers, thus patrons sometimes felt they got a "bad deal" or a "bargain." In other words, those unafraid to put in the effort to haggle repeatedly could secure a better price. Those who paid the asking price honestly invariably felt they were overcharged. In recent years, due to the economic downturn, shops of all sizes, striving to survive, sought to "snatch business" while ensuring they did not lose money. Thus, the practice of "cheap sales" flourished. As long as someone entered their shop, they were determined not to let them leave empty-handed. As competition intensified, the mercantile ethics of "no second price" were completely abandoned. The municipal authorities believe that such "commercial warfare" not only affects the prosperity of the market but also leads to the further decline of merchants' morals. Furthermore, the incident of a certain celebrity being deceived when buying antique porcelain bottles at the Dong'an Market led to the consideration of rescue measures. The Dong'an Market was the first to implement standard pricing, motivated by these concerns. The outcome has been excellent.</p>
<p>Results of Standard Pricing　The determination of standard prices seemed superficially difficult, and whether the shops could faithfully adhere to them was a matter of concern for many. The implementation method involved the shops forming a price evaluation committee, based on incoming invoices, to set prices for each item. Once assessed and labeled, the prices could not be arbitrarily raised or lowered. Recognizing the pain of past deceptive practices to attract customers, the merchants also believed that this method was necessary to maintain the status quo. As a result, since the implementation of standard market prices at the Dong'an Market, business has generally improved. Goods that previously yielded only a 2% profit margin can now be sold for 3% or 4%. Shop A no longer needs to drastically cut prices, and Shop B no longer needs to make significant sacrifices. Even antique stalls, which previously had no standard prices, now offer no discounts, adhering to a uniform price. In the past, the average daily sales for the entire Dong'an Market were approximately 34,000 yuan. Since the implementation of standard pricing, the average daily sales have increased to over 51,000 yuan. Since its implementation in the Xidan Market on the sixteenth of this month, business at the various shops has also shown improvement.</p>
<p>Fundamental Strategy for Prosperity　According to Cai Yuan, the Director of the Beiping Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Beiping is a famous former capital, and its cultural development is unparalleled in the world. Each year, numerous tourist groups, both large and small, from various countries visit Beiping, along with countless individual tourists. When visiting Beiping, they invariably purchase large quantities of goods to take back to their countries as souvenirs. If merchants treat them dishonestly, it will inevitably affect the prosperity of the entire commercial sector. Mayor Yuan, recognizing this, instructed the bureau to establish a standard pricing system to alleviate customers' suspicions and the hassle of haggling, while also ensuring that merchants' legitimate profits are not sacrificed by false cheap sales and giveaways. The municipal government is actively planning the construction of cultural and tourist areas in Beiping. When these projects are completed, tourists from various countries visiting Beiping will undoubtedly feel at home. This will aid the restoration of the former capital. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Gao Shaobai Killed in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Three Kidnapped Victims Rescued on the Spot</p>
<p>Two Women and Children Killed by Stray Bullets</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Gao Shaobai, a notorious bandit in southern Fujian, was the younger brother of Shang Weiguo, who was previously executed by the provincial government. After Shang Weiguo's execution, Gao Shaobai continued to operate as a bandit from his old lair in Fushan. During the Fujian Rebellion, when the anti-rebellion army arose, Gao gathered his men and requested to be incorporated into the army. However, due to his incorrigible bandit nature, he was subsequently attacked by the army. Eventually, Gao Wuchi led the remaining men to surrender. Gao Shaobai disagreed with Wuchi and remained in his old lair, joining forces with Wang Chengfa and other bandits from western Hui'an, continuing his outlaw life. The area north of Quanzhou's North Gate, including Jinbei, was frequently harassed. Lu Pengqi, the town head and militia commander of the eastern part of the first district of Jinjiang County, believed that Gao Shaobai had no intention of surrendering and that Wan Wai, a resident of Xiaotian Village in his district, had been kidnapped by him and a ransom of 500 yuan demanded. He, therefore, sought and received approval from the county government to thoroughly eliminate them regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. On the evening of the 18th, at approximately 8:00 PM, Lu dispatched 100 militia members in cars, traveling along the Quanluo Road and then turning onto Shuangyang Road, resting in Xingnei Village. At approximately 2:00 AM on the 19th, they set off in four groups, and at approximately 3:00 AM, they entered Fushan, splitting into three groups to attack the residences of Gao Shaobai, Wang Chengfa, and Ji Zhuzai. Another team was assigned to guard the location where the kidnapped victims were held. It was agreed that the attack would commence at Gao's residence first, and then the other three groups would simultaneously open fire. The group attacking Gao's residence initiated the attack. After breaching the gate, gunfire erupted from inside the house. The militia members charged into the house, and Gao Shaobai and his nephew Ji Haoyin, along with three others, were killed inside. Ji Zhuzai and four others in another group were also killed at their residence. Wang Chengfa escaped. Three kidnapped victims were rescued. Two women and children were killed by stray bullets. Lu and others then brought the rescued victims to the city to report the case. County Magistrate Yu Gongwu highly praised the members of each team. Over the years, more than a dozen bandit leaders in southern Fujian have been killed. After the central army entered Fujian, Lin Jing and You Sifu were also killed. Now, Gao Shaobai has been put to death. It is hoped that the bandits who have plagued Fujian Province for over a decade can now be eliminated. (21st)</p>
<h3>Huihua Steamboat of Xiamen Capsizes</h3>
<p>Forty-Six People Rescued</p>
<p>Two Bodies Recovered</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The Huihua steamboat of the Yonghe Shipping Company of this city departed from Xiamen at 2:00 PM on the 18th, carrying cargo to Shima Town in Zhangzhou. While passing Chicken Island near Wooden Island, it capsized due to strong winds. As of the evening of the 20th, it was learned that 46 crew members and passengers had been rescued. The number of deaths and missing persons is unknown due to the unclear number of passengers on board. The losses are estimated at over 20,000 yuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>According to a survivor named Guo, the ship carried over 70 passengers and a large amount of cargo on that day. There were 180 barrels of oil at the front of the ship, and much of the other cargo was placed on the deck. Due to insufficient seating, many passengers were lying down or scattered on the cargo boxes. The ship was thus top-heavy. While passing through the Chicken Island entrance and turning towards Haimen, where the currents from Shima and Fugong Harbor meet to form a strong confluence, the waves were extremely large. At the same time, a strong southeasterly wind was blowing, causing the ship to rock violently. After tilting severely several times to the left and right, a gust of wind caused the ship to lose its balance and capsize to the left, eventually turning over completely with its hull facing upwards. The cargo immediately fell into the sea. Approximately 80 passengers and crew members clung to the hull as the ship capsized slowly, preventing them from being swept away by the waves. Shortly after the capsizing, a Meijiang boat passed by, and the survivors cried out for help. The Meijiang boat circled once, but due to the strong wind and waves, the passengers on the Meijiang boat, fearing the small size and danger of their vessel, prevented them from approaching. It then sailed directly to Xiamen. Subsequently, two sailing boats arrived and rescued 35 people, taking them to Shima and Haimen. Guo (the survivor) and five of his friends were among them. It is estimated that approximately 40 people drowned or went missing. The above is the account of the Huihua's accident. After the Meijiang arrived in Xiamen and reported the incident, the Yonghe Shipping Company immediately dispatched two steamboats, and the water police dispatched the Haiping ship to assist. When they arrived at the scene, it was already 8:00 PM at night. All the survivors had already been rescued, and only the Huihua's hull was visible, floating upside down. The rescue boats then returned. The next morning, on the 19th, they returned to tow the capsized Huihua back. The bodies of an elderly woman in her 70s and a three-year-old child were found in the hull. The search for bodies on that day yielded no results. On the 20th, three steamboats and more than ten small boats continued the search for bodies, but still found nothing. The incident has caused an uproar in Xiamen. It is considered as serious as the sinking of the Bianli ship in 1930, which resulted in over 150 deaths. The Longxi Native Place Association immediately held a meeting and established a registry for the families of the deceased to investigate the number of victims. The Silk Industry Guild sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, criticizing the shipping company for prioritizing profits over safety and disregarding the lives of merchants and millions of dollars worth of goods, requesting serious negotiations. According to the Yonghe Shipping Company's report to the customs, the ship carried 51 pieces of miscellaneous goods and textiles, 180 barrels of raw oil, 31 passengers, and 17 crew members. The customs had inspected and approved the manifest, and the Second Brigade of the water police had also approved the voyage. The customs had set the passenger limit for the Huihua at 80 people and the weight limit at 9.75 tons. The passengers and cargo carried on this voyage did not exceed these limits. Furthermore, the Huihua's inspection period had expired, and the entire ship had been repaired in Shima before reporting to the Xiamen Maritime Affairs Office of the Ministry of Transportation for inspection, which approved the voyage. It also had 60 life jackets and 3 lifebuoys. The safety equipment was also in good order. This incident was due to the strong wind and waves, a natural disaster that could not be prevented by human effort. However, according to passengers, there were over 70 passengers, and nearly 90 people including crew members. Furthermore, according to a letter from the Silk Fabric Guild to the Chamber of Commerce, the ship was carrying 168 loads of cargo, approximately 10 tons, according to known estimates from various shops. Therefore, the responsibility is currently unclear and depends on whether more bodies are discovered and the results of the registration of the families of the deceased. Furthermore, much of the cargo entrusted by Yongkangcheng and others was retrieved by local villagers after the ship capsized. The water police dispatched patrol boats to the nearby villages on the 20th to recover the goods and continue searching for bodies. (21st)</p>
<h3>Ten Counties in Jiangxi Conscript Labor to Dredge the Fu River</h3>
<p>Construction to Begin on January 16th Next Year, Completion in Twenty Days</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The Construction Department of the provincial government, recognizing that the rivers of Jiangxi Province have been neglected for years, resulting in the growth of islands, divergent river channels, and a desolate appearance, with the Fu River being the worst affected, realizes that the river lacks the capacity to discharge floodwaters, causing frequent flooding. In terms of navigation, the water depth in winter is often less than one meter, making it difficult for lightly loaded sailboats to navigate. The river brings only water disasters without its benefits. Now that banditry has been suppressed, renovation and dredging are the most urgent tasks for future construction. It has been decided to start with the Fu River basin this winter, following Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's decree of the people's service, by conscripting labor each winter to carry out various water conservancy projects, progressing annually to eliminate water disasters and promote water conservancy, thereby benefiting the people's livelihood and the national economy. The plan has been approved by the provincial government meeting today (21st). Yan Fangtian, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, will soon go to the various counties to urge implementation. Construction is scheduled to begin on January 16th next year and be completed within twenty clear days. Inspection and acceptance will be completed by February 16th. The plan is appended below:</p>
<p>Engineering Standards　The main problems of the Fu River are the growth of islands and divergent channels at medium water levels, and unstable embankments and overflowing floods at high water levels. The river's ability to scour sand is greatest during high water levels. At medium water levels, the river has no fixed channels, causing the water to disperse and deposit silt, forming islands and obstructing the river. Therefore, this year's projects will focus on the following two aspects: (A) Dredging islands and shoals downstream from Nanfeng. Dredge the islands and shoals that obstruct the flow of water at medium water levels, selecting key areas. The dredging depth should be such that the bottom of the new channel is level with the low water surface. The width should be based on the width of the river channel at medium water levels in nearby good river sections. The slope of the bank away from the water on the new river channel should be a gentle slope of 1:10 to 1:20. The dredged sand should be used to reinforce the embankments on both sides or to fill in the beaches on both sides. If the newly filled sand is easily eroded by the water flow, it should be covered with solid soil on the water side or surrounded by embankments to prevent erosion. (B) Reinforcing the embankments along both sides of the river downstream from Linchuan. The standard for the embankments should be a top width of 3 meters, 1 meter higher than the highest flood level, an outer slope of at least 1:1.5, and an inner slope of 1:2. However, for non-direct impact embankment sections, if the project is too large, the inner slope may be changed to two types of slopes: from the top of the embankment to two-thirds of the height, use a slope of 1:1, and from two-thirds of the height to the foot of the embankment, use a slope of 1:2. All ditches and ports caused by embankment breaches should be properly blocked.</p>
<p>Construction Sections　The construction sections planned for this year are as follows: (1) Dredging the Shuinan to Dougang section in Nanfeng. (2) Dredging the Jixianli to Qiufang section in Lichuan. (3) Dredging the Taipingqiao to Yangjiadu section in Nancheng. (4) Dredging the Guanhongqiao to Tanfang section in Yihuang. (5) Dredging the section in front of the Yuhun Temple in Chongren. (6) Dredging the area from Huwan to Xiamashan in Jinxi. (7) Constructing embankments along the Fu River in Linchuan and blocking the breaches on both sides. (8) Dredging the Nanbeiqiao to Yangfang section in Dongxiang. (9) Dredging the Shun Port project in both Nanjin counties and repairing various dike embankments in Jinxian. (10) Repairing and reinforcing the embankments along the river in Nanchang and dredging the Shun Port project in both Nanjin counties. The above proposed construction sections for each county will be resurveyed by personnel from the Water Conservancy Bureau, and construction will be carried out.</p>
<p>Number of Workers Conscripted　The number of workers to be conscripted this year is determined according to the number of able-bodied men and the severity of the famine in each county. The proposed number of workers to be conscripted from each county is as follows: (1) Nanfeng: 2,000 people. (2) Lichuan: 2,000 people. (3) Nancheng: 3,000 people. (4) Yihuang: 4,000 people. (5) Chongren: 5,000 people. (6) Jinxi: 3,000 people. (7) Linchuan: 20,000 people. (8) Dongxiang: 5,000 people. (9) Jinxian: 6,000 people. (10) Nanchang: 20,000 people. In total, 70,000 workers will be conscripted daily from the above counties. The county magistrates of each county are responsible for collecting the workers and supervising the implementation of the construction methods stipulated by the Water Conservancy Bureau.</p>

However, Huang acted aggressively and confined Xu in the teahouse. After mediation by bystanders, Xu was given three days to pay before being released. Xu was stimulated by this incident, feeling extremely resentful, and had the idea of ending his life. He went to the Pincheng Hall pharmacy in the town, purchased a package of arsenic, and secretly swallowed it after returning home. He died of poisoning that night. Yesterday, the family of the deceased requested the county government to send personnel to inspect the body.

<h3>Promoters of the "Student National Goods Year" Held a Preparatory Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Elected Staff, Approved Organizational Outline, etc.</p>
<p>And Agreed to Hold an Opening Ceremony on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Various circles in this city have designated next year as "Student National Goods Year." Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the association held a promoters' meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to approve the organizational and work outlines and elect directors. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan reported, "The preparatory committee for the 'Student National Goods Year' invited gentlemen to participate as members, and we are honored by their enthusiastic participation. The significance of this initiative lies in the fact that the National Goods Year movement has been ongoing for two years. In these two years, it has achieved considerable success. The general public believes that the trade deficit is very large, considering the promoters ineffective and unproductive. Some say that imports of women's cosmetics have not decreased, and the promotion by women's circles has also been ineffective. However, conversely, if we had not promoted it, the import volume might have been even greater. Therefore, the failure to reduce the trade deficit cannot be blamed on the ineffectiveness of the promoters. It should be understood that there are many new foreign products, which are overwhelming and beyond our expectations. For example, with the accessibility of highways, the number of cars and gasoline consumption is increasing daily, which is beyond the ability of promoters to control. The increase in imported cosmetics is not entirely used by our country's women; some may be used by foreigners. At the same time, it is also related to social customs and habits, such as the increase in dance halls and cafes, which leads to more cosmetics consumption. This is related to social education. From our own perspective, doing something is better than doing nothing, and putting in effort is better than not putting in effort. If we want to increase exports, we must continue to work hard. We firmly believe that in these two years, the social mentality of looking down on domestic goods has decreased, and the sales of foreign goods versus domestic goods are better for domestic goods. The failure of domestic goods emporiums in the past has gradually diminished over the past two years, and they have been able to stand on their own. This is also an undeniable fact. Although it is due to the factories' own improvements, the change in social attitudes is a major reason. The National Goods movement should promote mutual progress between consumption, production, and sales. Why do we focus on students? Because students have pure minds and can set an example to awaken the general public, their achievements will be greater than others. Therefore, we have designated next year as 'Student National Goods Year' and will intensify our work. Looking back at the student movements of 1915, 1919, 1925, and 1931, anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese boycotts were all primarily led by students, and it may be more effective to unite with industry and commerce to promote domestic goods." Chen Jicheng and Zhang Shouyong then reported (omitted).</p>

<h3>Banking Sector Offers Advice, Asking the Ministry of Finance to Reward Silver Imports</h3>
<p>Refund Original Taxes or Exempt Future Taxes When Returning</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Have Requested the Ministry of Finance to Consider</p>
<p>Minister Kong Declares That He Will Never Allow Inflation</p>
<p>New Voice News reports: The Shanghai money market is extremely tight, and the daily interest rate has risen to four jiao. The reason is that the autumn harvest of agricultural products and year-end accounting have led to a shortage of silver. In addition to strict crackdowns by customs on smuggling, the Ministry of Finance has promulgated reward and punishment measures, strictly ordering provinces and industries to assist. Although its effectiveness is significant, it is not a fundamental solution. A New Voice News reporter learned yesterday from the Shanghai banking sector that banking leaders Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, and others had visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to offer advice on rewarding silver imports. Because China's silver only has exports and no imports, although exports have been greatly reduced, if this continues, China's silver will inevitably gradually decrease in the future. It is hoped that the government will find ways to reward silver exports. However, the bank's view is that, for example, when exported silver is returned, the silver tax and equalization tax levied at the time of export by customs should be refunded, or when the returned silver is re-exported in the future, export tax and equalization tax should be exempted. At the same time, in view of market rumors of inflation, it is requested that Minister Kong make a clear statement to dispel public doubts and reassure people. At that time, Minister Kong promised to consider rewarding silver imports, but strongly refuted the rumors of inflation and solemnly declared that as long as he is in office, he will never allow inflation, reduce the silver content of silver coins, or issue inconvertible banknotes. It is even more absurd. It is heard that foreign banks such as HSBC and Mercantile have requested the Ministry of Finance to consider not levying taxes again when silver that has already been levied with export silver tax and equalization tax is re-exported after being returned. The Ministry of Finance is considering this issue. If approved, the silver previously shipped by HSBC and other foreign banks to Hong Kong and other places will be shipped back to regulate finance, because the number of foreign banks exporting is very large, resulting in thin inventories. In case of a bank run, it would be difficult to cope, so for precautionary purposes, they are willing to ship back the exported silver.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong Cables Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to Strictly Suppress the Smuggling of Silver Exports</h3>
<p>Three Stipulated Reward and Punishment Measures</p>
<p>Please Order Military and Police Agencies to Comply</p>
<p>Dagong News reports: In order to prevent the outflow of cash and stabilize domestic silver prices, the Ministry of Finance has implemented the levying of export tax and equalization tax on silver, but there are still a few unscrupulous people who seek profits through smuggling. Although the customs have been strictly investigating, they have not been completely eliminated. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi convened many experts and held several meetings with the banking sector to formulate reward and punishment measures, which will be implemented immediately, and cabled Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to instruct the military and police agencies to comply. The content of the measures is extremely thorough. After implementation, smuggling can be eliminated. The original text of Kong's telegram to Chiang and the implemented reward and punishment measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: Chairman Chiang, in view of the fact that the silver export tax was originally intended to stabilize finance and the market, there are unscrupulous people who seek private gain, disregard the overall situation, and frequently smuggle exports. Violating the law and operating privately is extremely hateful. The Ministry has previously strictly ordered all customs houses to investigate carefully and ordered silver and money industry guilds and chambers of commerce to jointly supervise and secretly report. In order to prevent and control thoroughly, we have also consulted with the provincial and municipal governments and instructed their subordinate military and police to assist the customs in handling the matter. If smuggling of silver or silver coins is found, or those who instigate smuggling, they should immediately report secretly to the nearby customs. If there is no customs location, they can also report to the local financial ministry's affiliated agency or other government agencies for preliminary detention and submit it to the ministry for verification and handling. In order to eliminate private export, the Ministry has specifically formulated generous reward measures, which will be implemented immediately. In addition to consulting separately, it is requested that you review and approve the matter and instruct military and police agencies to comply.</p>
<p>Implementation of Reward and Punishment Law: The reward and punishment measures are stipulated as follows: (1) Seizing smuggled silver coins or silver: In addition to confiscating the silver coins or silver, a penalty of double the amount of smuggling will be imposed, and those who instigate will be severely punished. (2) The silver coins or silver confiscated in the preceding paragraph (after being sold at a price) will be used to award bonuses according to the following method: (A) If the customs or military and police agencies seize them independently, the reward will be doubled according to the customs' method of rewarding informants. That is, for exceptional merit, 60% will be given, and for ordinary merit, 40% will be given. (For example, if 10,000 yuan of smuggled silver coins are seized and confiscated, military police or customs officers with exceptional merit will be awarded 6,000 yuan, and those with ordinary merit will be awarded 4,000 yuan.) (B) If the customs receive a tip from an informant and seize it with the assistance of military and police, the reward will be doubled according to the customs' method of rewarding informants. Military police and informants will each receive 40%, and customs officers will receive 20%. (As in the previous example, military police informants will each receive 4,000 yuan, and customs officers will receive 2,000 yuan.) (C) If the customs seize it based on a tip from an informant (without the assistance of military police), the informant will receive 60% of the reward, and the customs officers will receive 40%. (D) If the customs seize it with the assistance of military police (without a tip from an informant), the military police will receive 40% of the reward, and the customs officers will receive 40%. The names of the informants shall be kept confidential. (3) The double penalty stipulated in item 1 (except for smugglers who escape) cannot be imposed, or the smuggler is unable to pay the fine, the military police informants and customs officers related in items A, B, C, and D of item 2 shall be given 20%, and the remainder shall be turned over to the public.</p>
<h3>National Silk Dress Movement</h3>
<p>Men's Blue Robe and Black Mandarin Jacket, Women's Blue Dress and Black Skirt</p>
<p>Hope to Comply with National New Year and Various Celebrations</p>
<p>Silk Industry Guild Submission: The city's Silk Industry Guild believes that the National New Year is approaching in an instant, and all circles have celebrations as usual. They should wear national silk dresses to set an example, so they submitted submissions to party and government agencies, requesting that they issue a general order to all levels of the country to comply with the following text: China National Party Executive Committee, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Shanghai Municipal Government, I sincerely believe that promoting national goods is an urgent task for the present, and rescuing silk is an especially urgent and important task. The national silk is gorgeous and rich, and it once shone all over the world. Clothing is a tool for showing one's body, and the civilization of the country is what one sees. Since the revolution, short foreign clothes have become popular in temples. Clothes are not neat, and the people lose their image. Profits overflow, and the national economy is declining. I think about the future and feel cold. I submitted to the Ministry of Interior on April 16, 1929, and promulgated the clothing regulations, which limited the use of domestic goods. At that time, I thought that the government and education would change the fashion. After several years, the laws and regulations are the same as the shackles. The use of foreign countries to change China is now fierce. The sales of national silk have decreased day by day, and the import of foreign goods has increased with time. The blood of the national economic lifeline is on the verge of exhaustion. The psychology of Chinese people loving foreign goods is booming. Thinking of this, I feel trembling. I think again and again that the way to save is only two ways. On the one hand, the silk manufacturing industry should improve its products to meet the needs of the society. On the other hand, I look forward to the enthusiastic promotion of party and government personnel and their personal practice, so as to achieve the effect of the wind. Silk is originally a fine and special product of our country, with a long and glorious history. In recent years, manufacturers have carefully studied, purchased machines, and strived for improvement. Silk products are enough to be beautiful in Europe and the West. In addition, the price of silk has fallen, and the price of national silk is low. It is almost the same as imported cloth. All of these have facts to follow. They are not just empty words. It is only because the Chinese people are obsessed with Europeanization, short foreign clothes, and boast to each other. They take materials from imported woolen cloth, and do not hesitate to spend money like dirt. They despise domestic silk, and do not care about the cheap price. The dynasty and the field follow the custom, and the whole country is crazy. Last year, silk merchants lost their profits, and silk factories went bankrupt one after another. How many people lost their jobs? This year, western Zhejiang is drought-stricken, and silkworms have no market for sale. The displaced people are related, and the hungry people are everywhere. If we do not try to save it now, how can we imagine the future? I think it is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, not just the silk industry. For this reason, I urgently appeal to your council, court, and government to issue a general order to all public officials and personnel to set an example and be a guide for the people. They should strictly comply with the clothing regulations. Men's formal attire should be a blue robe and a black mandarin jacket, and women's formal attire should be a blue dress and a black skirt. The materials should all be limited to domestic goods. From now on, ceremonies and important meetings, as well as happy events, funerals, etc., should be dressed in national silk dresses to set an example. The National New Year is approaching in an instant, and all circles have celebrations as usual. I especially hope to take this opportunity to issue a general order to comply with it, so that the top will follow the bottom, the decline will be saved, and the men will follow the women, and the national silk is expected to turn around. The hair is tied in one stroke, and it is here. In addition to sending separate telegrams, I respectfully request your council, court, and government to review and approve and quickly issue a general order to comply with it. The national economy and the people's livelihood are really dependent on it. Luo Qinghua, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Industry Guild, kowtows respectfully.</p>
<p>Lake Society Held on New Year's Day: The Guizhou Road Lake Society in this city believes that although the national dress system of our country has been stipulated and announced by the Ministry of Interior and uses domestic silk and wool fabrics as raw materials, it has not been implemented by the people, which not only hinders the appearance but also loses the national image. In addition to having telegraphed the Fifth National Congress and the Executive Yuan and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to instruct their subordinate agencies to wear them when holding the Premier's Memorial Week and other ceremonies, as well as happy events and weddings, the society has decided to hold a dress movement on New Year's Day next year when fellow villagers and members of the society gather to worship. From 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on that afternoon, and from 2:00 PM to 12:00 PM on the second afternoon, there will be dress performances, as well as singing and dancing, national art, and Ping opera performed by members of the society's club to promote it. The city's silk industry guilds have been invited by the society to participate. It is heard that most of the people who will attend will wear blue robes and black mandarin jackets to show their promotion.</p>
<h3>Factories Petitioned Yesterday to Strive for Inspection Sovereignty</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau Announced to Maintain Labor Administrative Power</p>
<p>Report to the Municipal Government to Negotiate with the Concession Authorities as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>New Voice News reports: The issue of factory inspections in the Special Area has been delayed and unresolved. Recently, the authorities in the Special Area have often sent personnel to factories to inspect equipment and other matters. The factories petitioned the competent authorities yesterday to strive for sovereignty. The Municipal Social Bureau announced yesterday to factories in the Special Area that if the above-mentioned situation occurs, it should be reported for verification and handling. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strive for Sovereignty: Factories in the Special Area have submitted a report to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, and the Social Bureau because the Special Area Bureau often sends personnel to factories to inspect equipment, which is related to the sovereignty of our country. Its intentions seem to be to create a fait accompli in order to encroach on sovereignty. They petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, and the Social Bureau to strive for sovereignty and asked for instructions on how to handle it. After receiving reports from the factories, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau believed that labor administration was the proper function of the bureau. In addition to notifying the factories, it reported to the municipal government to negotiate with the Special Area authorities as soon as possible to resolve the inspection of factories in the concession.</p>
<p>Notify the Factories: The Social Bureau issued a notice to the factories in the Special Area of the city, saying that according to the report from the factories in the Special Area of the city, personnel not belonging to the bureau often go to the factories to inspect equipment. The detailed methods for the bureau to send personnel to inspect the factories in the Special Area have been discussed for a long time, but there is no concrete decision yet. Labor administration is the proper function of the bureau. All units are ordered to comply. In the future, when the above-mentioned situation occurs in the factories, it should be reported to the bureau immediately for transfer to the bureau for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Joint Petition: Cheng Shouzhong, director of the Joint Association of Domestic Goods Factories, Ge Shengru, manager of Hongxing Socks Factory, Lu Renlin, representatives of the Shanghai Knitting Industry Guild, and others went to the Municipal Government Social Bureau in the city center yesterday morning to petition, because the French Concession authorities notified Hongxing Socks Factory to pay 70 yuan for boiler inspection fees. They requested a quick negotiation. Tian Heqing, director of the inspection section of the third department of the Social Bureau, received them and promised to report to the municipal government for verification and handling. Yu Hongjun, secretary-general of the municipal government, received them and promised to investigate and handle it.</p>
<h3>Haili's Maiden Voyage Today</h3>
<p>Sailors and Shipowners Are Considering</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship Haili has arrived at Jinliyuan Wharf from Jiangnan Shipyard yesterday. The ship's hull inspection has been completed. Shipowner Teng Shibia and others have arrived on the ship to take office. At 2:30 PM, the ship held a supplementary invitation for leaders of party and government agencies, the Seamen's Union, the Master Mariners' Association, and the Marine Engineers' Association to visit the ship, as well as the Minsheng Industrial Company, Shangjiang Wanxian Chongqing, Nanhua Shantou Xiamen Guangdong and Hong Kong passenger gangs to visit the ship and provide tea and snacks. The ship also gave up the Hong Kong passenger seats and only carried Shantou Guangdong passengers, so it did not apply for a Hong Kong passenger license. It is scheduled to open its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Nanhua today. The fourth new ship Haizhen is currently being inspected at the Jiangnan Factory. All crew members, except for the first officer who has been assigned Xue Bang, the chief engineer has been assigned Zhang Guoquan, the first engineer has been assigned Lin Hongfa, and the boatswain is Ding Zhongkun. The position of captain was initially intended to be filled by Puan's Laux. The bureau is now considering that when Laux was the captain of Puan, he collided with the Blue Funnel Line's giant ship Philos, causing a loss of more than 100,000 yuan, which is still under negotiation. He also sank a sailboat outside the port of Qingdao, which has not been resolved. And the ship does not carry passengers to Hong Kong, so there is no need to send a foreign captain. Therefore, the bureau has not yet filled out the commission, and the general shipowner and the head of the shipping department are still discussing it carefully. Because the bureau has many experienced Chinese shipowners, it is still under consideration. The carpets in the first-class cabins of the four new ships have been made of excellent quality, but the carpets are woven with the national emblem. The bureau believes that the national emblem should be given special respect. Weaving it on the carpets and stepping on it is not appropriate. Therefore, it has ordered the captains of the four ships to remove the original national emblem carpets and store them in the bureau, and purchase new carpets of superior quality to replace them. The shipping department is still studying and improving the equipment of the four ships. The life jackets for passengers are planned to be the latest and most efficient. More efforts will be made in theft prevention, separating the crew's duty station from the passenger seats, making it strong and convenient, so that the crew can be in an extremely safe position during the voyage, so that pirates have no way to use their tricks to protect the safety of travel and create a new record in China's coastal merchant ships for protecting passengers and preventing theft.</p>

<h3>Request from the Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council to Refrain from Overestimating Rent</h3>
<p>Market Slump Leads to Lower Rent</p>
<p>Addressing Financial Shortfalls Should Start with Vacant Properties</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, according to a letter from Chen Yueshan, Chen Yueshan resides at No. 71, Lane 112, Sanguantang Lane, Public Concession. This house was built by the China Business Company in 1923 and rented for 40 yuan per month. In 1927, I purchased it, continuing to pay taxes based on the 40 yuan rent. This has been the case for over ten years without any issues. In February of this year, I also built a house on the vacant land next door, which was completed in May. In December and January, it was rented to Chongdao Hall for 40 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, the foreign tax collector of the Municipal Council wanted to calculate the tax based on a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Despite explaining this several times and providing the lease as proof, they refused to accept it. Reluctantly, I went to the tax office of the Municipal Council several times to explain, but to no avail. Furthermore, they escalated the situation, attempting to increase the rent assessment of my residence at No. 71, where I have lived for over ten years, to 80 yuan. They even threatened to increase it to 100 yuan if I did not comply. The Municipal Council's tax collection is based on the level of rent. My residence at No. 71 and the newly built No. 69 next door share a total area of about five fen. Based on a land value of 20,000 yuan per mu, the land value is 10,000 yuan, and the construction cost of both houses is 7,000 yuan, totaling 17,000 yuan. The monthly rent for both houses is 80 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of about five percent. In the current market, a five percent interest rate is not low. If the foreign tax collector wants to overestimate the rent, they are welcome to rent it from the Municipal Council. Moreover, when I first moved here, the area was quite desolate. To this day, streetlights have not been installed, the public pit opposite has not been removed, and the main road to the east is filled with collapsed carts. The situation has not improved in decades. Furthermore, the residents nearby are mostly dockworkers, living in very unsanitary conditions. Every summer, they sleep outside in the ditches. They are ignorant of public morality, and the police do not intervene. Daily access is difficult. I only remain here because the house is my own property, and moving elsewhere is not economically feasible. In the current economic downturn, it is common to see tenants demanding rent reductions, and landlords voluntarily reducing rents. For example, the rent for Hartung's properties on Nanjing Road is so high that they remain vacant and generate no income. If the rent for my house is overestimated and taxes are increased, no one will want to rent it. The tax collector ignores the market situation and rashly increases taxes by more than half, which is unreasonable. I have been fulfilling my tax obligations in the concession for over ten years. Now, the tax collector only knows how to increase taxes, while neglecting public health and road traffic. After much consideration, I cannot remain silent. I have long admired your association as the leader of Chinese residents in the concession, so I dare to present this matter directly, requesting that you forward a letter to the Municipal Council's tax office, urging them to consider the market situation when dealing with residents in the concession and to refrain from arbitrarily imposing taxes." Upon arrival, the Shanghai market was found to be even more desolate. Silver exports are shrinking, and the daily dismantling rate is as high as four corners, with chips being even more scarce. This is a matter of deep concern for those who care about the market. If the municipal authorities do not reduce or even maintain the existing tax rates, it is uncertain whether the situation will improve. If, on the one hand, the value of real estate is declining, and on the other hand, they maintain high rents or overestimate land values or rents to increase taxes, then under the dual pressure, the liquidation of shops and the relocation of residences will be an inevitable result of the contraction of the social economy. Taxpayers foresee this phenomenon, taking Nanjing Road as an example, and have already seen its beginnings. How they themselves struggle to overcome the difficulties is a matter that can be temporarily set aside. It is deeply known that the bureau's resulting shortfall in tax revenue is a fact that is difficult to avoid, so the delegation authorized the bureau to implement a case of levying a general tax on vacant houses that passed the recent representative conference, it has been delayed and no facts have been seen, and instead, one began by estimating higher rent, which was only limited to hotels, etc. in the central district, and recently also to undeveloped areas that have been disturbed, we must know that the small number of stores that recently opened on Nanjing Road have an understanding with the landlord, and are of a completely trial nature, and the rent is not counted at all, if one only knows its surface but does not know its actual content, increase the general tax bit by bit, then the public increase is not much, the private sector has already been exhausted, and as a result, the tax loss due to vacant houses without tax will be higher than the income from the increased tax, because the individual relationship is very great, therefore a particularly earnest letter is sent to your bureau, urging the tax office to plan as a whole, so that seeking benefit causes damage to be important, this is addressed to the head office of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Second Batch of Deported Overseas Chinese from Japan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Eleven Refugees Return Home on Two Ships</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to Issue Funds Today for Relief</p>
<p>Many batches of overseas Chinese refugees deported from Japan have arrived in Shanghai, reaching twenty-one batches so far. Although our diplomatic authorities have filed protests three times, they have been ineffective. The Japanese authorities continue to expel overseas Chinese. Yesterday, another eleven overseas Chinese, including Wang Shunxing, Wang Zhouyue, Wu Qianlu, Xu Dingqian, Pan Jinyuan, Wu Zhenlong, Wu Chengan, Zhou Bujin, Chen Yanliang, Pan Guixing, and Zhou Rihao, arrived in Shanghai on the Ikoma Maru and Tsukuba Maru. They were in a very distressed state. After arriving in Shanghai, the refugees were sent to the Old Gongxin Inn. Upon hearing the news, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau immediately sent Mr. Tan Zhonglu to offer condolences, promising to register them and providing a temporary relief fund of five yuan per person this afternoon to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Director of the Guangdong National Products Promotion Office, Chen Yuan Ying Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guangzhou District First Sugar Factory to Open on the 5th, Sugar Merchants Contracted for Promotion by Shanghai Xinghua Company</p>
<p>Chen Ying, Director of the Guangdong National Products Promotion Office, arrived in Shanghai yesterday to discuss the promotion of national products. The Guangzhou District First Sugar Manufacturing Factory of Guangdong Province is scheduled to open on the 5th of next month. Guangdong sugar is contracted for sale by Shanghai Xinghua Company. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sugar Factory Opening: Chen Yuan Ying, Director of the Guangdong National Products Promotion Office, is in Shanghai this time to discuss the promotion of national products. The Guangzhou District First Sugar Manufacturing Factory of the Guangdong Provincial Government, which belongs to the office, has been completed and has already shipped goods. The manager is concurrently the Director of the Rural Affairs Bureau, Feng Rui. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 5th of next month, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Sugar Industry Association, among others, have been invited to send representatives to participate. The second, third, and fourth sugar factories have also been completed one after another and are scheduled to start shipping goods next month. The opening dates will be selected later.</p>
<p>Shanghai Merchants' Promotion: The Shanghai Xinghua Company is wholly responsible for the promotion of sugar produced by the Guangdong provincial machine-made sugar factory in Shanghai. At the same time, sugar merchants who are members of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association have jointly organized the Shanghai Sugar Industry Cooperative Co., Ltd. to resell the sugar of Xinghua Company. Preparations are currently underway. The first batch of domestically produced sugar is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. Its quality is very good, no different from Holan sugar. It is the first step in the imitation of foreign sugar machine-made domestic sugar. The future of domestic sugar is very promising.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Second New Wharf in Lianyungang</h3>
<p>Vessels Start Docking Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the completion of the first permanent new wharf in Lianyungang Port, Haizhou, this year, the loading and unloading of goods has more than doubled. Due to the convenience of loading and unloading, the China Merchants Bureau's intermodal transport ships have shortened their schedules and reduced operating costs, resulting in profits. The Director of the Lianyungang Branch, Chen Yongjie, telegraphed yesterday that the second new wharf has been completed. Starting from the 24th, the bureau's ships will officially dock. In the future, the volume of intermodal transport can be further increased, and the business will be expanded. More than 100 additional loading and unloading road police will be needed on the wharf.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Steamer Runs Aground on Black Sandbar</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River is shallow, especially in the area of Black Sandbar in Wuhu (near Hama-ga-Iso, where Sanbei Company's Matsuura ran aground). The water depth there is only seven or eight feet, making it difficult for heavily laden vessels to pass. The Wuhu Customs has issued measures for lightering and maintaining the waterway. Unexpectedly, the Sanbei Company's Matsuura steamer had just been towed out of the shallows when the Qingpu steamer, which was sailing upstream from Shanghai on the 23rd, ran aground in the same area due to the shallow water. It is reported that the Qingpu's draft is over eleven feet, which is significantly different from the water depth in the area. Therefore, although other Yangtze River vessels were ordered to tow it, it was difficult to achieve any effect. It is now planned to lighter the Qingpu steamer's cargo before attempting to tow it. Other Yangtze River steamers are also preparing to lighter cargo at that location to avoid being stranded.</p>
<h3>Senior Municipal Council Police Officers Awarded Medals by the Ministry of Military Affairs</h3>

Robertson) of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau's Police Department for their exceptional efforts in searching for and arresting communists. The Director-General of the Municipal Council expressed his gratitude to the Chinese authorities yesterday on behalf of the Municipal Council, stating that the Municipal Council's police officers were deeply gratified to be able to serve the government and receive awards.</p>
<h3>Reduced Rates for Long-Distance Priority Telephone Calls</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the long-distance telephone line on the Beijing-Shanghai highway, telephone traffic has been increasing daily. Priority telephone calls have traditionally been charged at three times the standard rate. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications, in order to reduce the burden on the public for making long-distance priority telephone calls, has specially changed the priority call charge to double the standard rate and has ordered all bureaus and offices to implement this change from January 1, 1935. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has ordered the long-distance station and all public telephone offices to comply and has informed the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau to take note.</p>

<h3>Pan Yangyao Discusses the Business Conditions of Various Industries Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>Money Shops Invest More in Rural Areas</p>
<p>National Products Industry Also Developing Daily</p>
<p>In order to understand the business conditions of various industries in Shanghai over the past year, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Pan Yangyao, who is familiar with the situation of various industries in Shanghai, yesterday and inquired about the situation of various industries. According to Mr. Pan, the money shop industry and the national products industry have made significant progress this year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Shop Industry: According to Mr. Pan, the business conditions of the money shop industry over the past year, with the exception of firms with shorter capital, had surpluses. Although several small banks in the city went bankrupt this year, this does not mean the decline of Shanghai's money shop industry. The banks with shorter capital have inflexible turnover, and most of their operations are speculative, and their internal organizations lack integrity, and therefore went bankrupt, it is not related to the money shop industry itself. This year, the banking authorities, in view of the danger of the concentration of silver in the city, have been engaged in rural lending. Statistics show that the city's banks invested more than 10 million in rural lending. Although the interest on this loan is thin and the formalities are cumbersome, rural borrowers value credit and are able to recover the funds on schedule, so banks believe that investing in rural lending is a sound and solid business and are happy to operate. The major banks are currently engaged in rural surveys in various places in order to increase the amount of investment in the coming year. According to the Bank Savings Law promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, the number of rural loans invested should account for one-fifth of the savings, while the total amount invested by banks this year is only 10 million yuan, which is very different from the provisions of the Bank Savings Law, so it was decided to actively invest in rural loans in various places from next year. As for rural finance in various places, with the exception of those who are in arrears due to disasters, the rest have had bumper harvests, and Shaanxi's cotton harvest reached 50 million yuan, and Xuchang's tobacco harvest reached more than 40 million yuan, which is unprecedented in previous years. Rural finance is ample, and next year's loans will inevitably increase as a result, which can be asserted. It is a good phenomenon that banks directly and indirectly actively invest in the interior, he said.</p>
<p>Cotton Mill Industry: As for the cotton mill industry, although there was no progress in the business conditions this year, the cotton mill authorities, in view of the industry's lifelessness, are actively seeking to improve methods. Rong Zongjing went to the Northwest for inspection and has now begun to organize the Cotton Yarn Industry Improvement Association to discuss improvement methods. The reasons for the decline of the cotton mill industry are: one is due to the shortage of capital and the heavy interest on the loan, the interest on the loan by the cotton mill is always between one point and nine points, and the interest on the loan by the Japanese cotton mill is only about two or three points, and the difference between the two is huge. As for the cost of each package of 20-count yarn, China needs more than 26 yuan, while Japanese yarn only needs about 18 yuan. The management of cotton mills is not as good as that of Japanese factories. For example, in China's cotton mills, 400 workers are required to manage every 10,000 spindles. Even if the system is improved now, 300 workers are still required. Japanese factories only need 180 workers. For these reasons, they cannot compete with Japanese yarn, and the business is declining daily. Several cotton mills had surpluses this year. The factory authorities are now working hard to improve, so there is hope starting next year. The flour industry had surpluses in the first half of the year and was normal in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>National Products Industry: The national products industry was in the best condition this year, with the machinery and electrical appliance industries being the best. The development of these two industries is a natural trend, and it is expected that they will develop more and more in the future. Because the interior is happy to purchase, such as electric lights, electric fans, agricultural tools, etc., have been purchased in large quantities, so the two industries have a large surplus. Although the reasons for their development are due to this, the increase in the import tax on large goods machinery and the reduction of the import tax on machinery raw materials are also small reasons. The silk and satin industry's business this year, although better than last year, but the profits are getting thinner year by year. The enamel industry is also developing, but the selling price is always below cost, and solutions are being discussed to maintain it. As for the dyeing and weaving industry, the dyeing industry has a surplus, while the weaving industry is not prosperous. As for small industries such as hot water bottle industry, bakelite industry, etc., they are all manufacturing abuse, and factory closures are piled on, which is a pity. The rubber industry is also in the end of its rope due to excessive competition among its peers, and the industrial community should pay attention to it, he said.</p>

<h3>Children's Benefit Concert to be Held Tonight</h3>
<p>Inspiring Underprivileged Children to Strive for Improvement Through Entertainment</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has launched a benefit concert for underprivileged children, with the aim of raising public awareness of impoverished children, continuing to actively seek welfare for underprivileged children, and practicing the Christian spirit of sacrifice and love. Therefore, it has made every effort to try and organize, and the preparations have been quite remarkable. All matters have been properly prepared, and the eleven district performances will be held from 9:00 to 12:00 tonight.</p>

<p>Assistance from All Sectors: In addition to the candies, biscuits, soaps, toothpastes, and various food items donated by major companies, which were published in various newspapers on Sunday, more than 1,300 yuan in cash has been received. In addition, the Lianhua Film Company donated 100 yuan. After deducting the expenses for the eleven district venues, the remaining amount will be used to purchase items and distribute them to the underprivileged children. All the major movie theaters and film companies are not only lending the venues and films, but all their staff are also cooperating with the YMCA in organizing the event. The singing and games at various locations will be performed by McLaren Middle School, Baiwen Girls' School, Mingde Girls' School, Zhenyi Elementary School, Sunday School choirs, the Municipal Council Girls' Middle School, and the Western District Elementary School. Dai Bingyi, Wang Yongfu, Li Changjian, Wu Jingyu, Lu Zhiyu, Zhao Hexiu and other members of the Jingzhi Group will be responsible for the singing. Games are all free assistance.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Disallows Bail in Counterfeit Money Case</h3>
<p>Released and Then Detained Again</p>
<p>Guard Accused of Fraud by Family</p>
<p>Liu Shouquan, a native of Qingjiang, residing at No. 296, Calle Road, French Concession, is 42 years old and a barber. In October of last year, he was arrested by the French Concession police for counterfeiting money. After interrogation by the Second Special Court, he was sentenced to one year and six months in prison and fined 50 yuan. After the sentence was confirmed, he was sent to the Second Special District Prison to serve his sentence. In October of this year, one year had passed. Liu entrusted someone to submit a petition requesting the prison to release him on bail in accordance with the law. After the prison approved the request, Liu was released on bail on October 26 and sent home. The prison reported the matter to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, which then forwarded it to the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry issued an order stating that Liu's crime did not meet the bail conditions and rejected the request, ordering that he continue to serve his sentence. When the ministry order arrived at the prison, Liu had already been released on bail for more than a month. On the 14th of this month, the prison sent a guard, Zhang He, to summon Liu and ordered him to continue serving his sentence. Liu's wife, Liu Wangshi, believed that her husband had already been released on bail and was suddenly summoned to serve his sentence. She recalled that during the summer of this year, a prison guard from Yangzhou named Wang Jiahan had come to her home on behalf of her husband to collect money, saying that he could guarantee a successful bail motion and had borrowed three yuan. Now that her husband had suddenly been summoned to serve his sentence, she believed that Wang had been to her home before and knew her address, so Wang Jiahen was definitely behind the matter. She went to the Second Special Prison to report that the guard had committed fraud and requested an investigation. After the warden summoned the guard Wang Jiakun for questioning, he prepared a document and transferred it to the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and interrogation. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren and clerk Peng Yu interrogated him in the fifth court. First, they heard the plaintiff Liu Wangshi's account of Jia Kun's fraud. When asked, Wang confessed that the first time he took three yuan from Liu Wangshi, it was Liu Shouquan who asked me to take it to buy a undershirt and health shirt. The second time he took three yuan was because my mother died and I joined Liu Wangshi for a share to reach 30 yuan to buy a coffin. In addition, he never took a penny, etc. The official also summoned the witnesses Liu Jinrong, guard Zhang He, and prisoner Liu Shouquan for questioning. They ordered a new verification to be heard later. After Liu Shouquan was released on bail, he was rejected by order of the ministry, and after the case was summoned to continue execution, the prosecutor of the High Third Branch had also opened and brought Liu to the case to investigate the circumstances of his request for bail.</p>
<h3>Fireworks Industry Association Appeals for Exemption from Prohibition</h3>
<p>Fireworks are a Sanitary Product</p>
<p>Greatly Affecting People's Livelihoods</p>
<p>Since the news of the joint consultation between the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus on banning fireworks was published in various newspapers on the 22nd of this month, the business of various fireworks shops has been greatly affected. Fireworks workers are uneasy. The Fireworks Industry Association has appealed to party and government agencies separately to exempt them from the ban. Its petition to the Social Affairs Bureau reads: "It is submitted for the purpose of earnestly requesting exemption from the prohibition, so as to maintain livelihoods and save commerce. I read in the newspapers of December 12 and 22 that your bureau sent personnel to consult with the Public Security Bureau on the prohibition of fireworks, which was shocking and inexplicable. I believe that the firecrackers a kind of unique handicraft product that has been around for thousands of years in our country, its function is to eliminate mountain mist and sea miasma, change bad air, refresh people's spirits, and help people's interests, so it is not only loved by the people of the whole country, but also welcomed by all countries in the world, occupying an important position in export goods, and the customs has records to check. The sales volume is the largest in Southeast Asia, because the miasma is the heaviest there, even in today's scientific age, if not for the gas of firecrackers and sulfur, there is no way to eliminate it, this is also iron evidence that firecrackers will not be affected by scientific invention and will be eliminated. There are those who do not have a deep understanding of the function of firecrackers, and presumptuously think that they are useless waste, but they do not know that the Hankou Fireworks Industry Association has submitted it to the Central Ministry of Health for chemical verification and determined that it is a sanitary product, and the original case is in place. This is only regarding the function of firecrackers, as for the statistics of workers and merchants engaged in the fireworks industry in the country, there are no less than millions. At this time when commercial depression, rural collapse, and economic depression are seriously enveloping, the fireworks industry is already dying, if the government authorities do not vigorously protect this nationwide handicraft industry, but inflict harm on it, then the future of people's livelihoods is truly unthinkable. Try to just prohibit the lighting of fireworks, the solution. If citizens do not light them, then the goods have no way out, the capital of firecrackers merchants will be turned into nothing, and the livelihood of firecrackers workers will be on the verge of extinction, in a flash, putting millions of firecrackers workers and merchants in the whole country in a place where they cannot live or die, why is the heart of your bureau so cruel? Even if it is to prohibit useless consumption, among the imported goods, there are thousands of types, and it is possible to shift the target and do so, sages think it is impossible to hate what the people like, I hope that your bureau will show mercy and exempt from prohibition, trembling and crying, I hope that you will show your compassion."</p>
<h3>Verdict Reached in Yi Fangshuo Case</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th</p>
<p>Yi's Request for Bail Denied</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a 43-year-old from Hangzhou residing at No. 147, Baxianfang Alley, Huage Nie Road in the French Concession, who performs comic acts and songs without theatrical scripts at the rooftop amusement park of the New New Company, forcibly raped his 19-year-old cousin Yi Baozhu and kept her under constant surveillance, forbidding her to step out of line. On the morning of the 11th of this month, at 10:00 AM, Baozhu finally managed to escape and reported to the French police station. The vice squad dispatched detectives to arrest Yi, along with his concubines Yi Caitao and Yi Meimei, his younger brother, and fourteen young female actors from his troupe. Investigation revealed that in addition to raping his cousin Baozhu, he had also raped his 13-year-old cousin Li Xiaozhen twice, and sold women named Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu, making them</p>
<p>learn to perform opera, etc. The police station, based on Articles 240, 243, 257, and 316 of the criminal code, regarding offenses against public morals, family, and freedom, filed a public prosecution with the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo held two hearings. Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhu suddenly requested to withdraw their accusations regarding the rape incidents. Subsequently, because the victims Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu did not appear in court for the cases of obstructing family and freedom under Articles 257 and 316, the trial could not proceed. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date, and Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen were allowed to be taken back by their guardians, Yi Hu and Ben Duo Fu, respectively, as previously reported. Yesterday, the hearing was resumed. Judge Zhang specially opened the Second Criminal Court for the trial. Lawyer Fei Xizhen represented the police station. The court ordered Yi to be brought in and first instructed Detective Bao, who was in charge of the case, to report on the</p>
<p>case investigation. According to the defending lawyers, the mothers of Ye Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu had arrived in court today and requested to be questioned. The court asked the defendant Yi Fangshuo about the background of the two girls. Yi Fangshuo replied, "Yang Lingzhu is 13 years old this year. She was sent by my sister last year around March or April to learn opera. She was brought by my sister from the countryside as an adopted daughter-in-law, to be married to my nephew. There are seven or eight girls in my household, five are students, and the rest are my own people. The terms of learning opera were all agreed upon verbally, without any contract. During the learning period, they eat at my expense, and after they learn, I recommend them or have them</p>
<p>perform in my troupe. Ye Jinzhu is the daughter of Section Chief Ye, sent to me to learn opera. She is very lively, and has fallen and injured herself severely twice. She was sent to the hospital to be treated, so she needs to be accompanied when she goes out, which does not infringe on their freedom. I teach them by giving advice, and do not beat them. I did not buy the two girls with money," etc. At this point, the court ordered Yi to be taken down and summoned Ye Jinzhu to the stand. The girl testified, "I am 14 years old, born in the Year of the Rooster, and from Hangzhou. I live at No. 28, Fachangli in Hangzhou. My father is Ye Qiuda, formerly a trainee in the Water Police Bureau. I have never been beaten. When I am not performing opera, I play at home and am very free. I am accompanied when I go out. I did not say at the police station that I was sold to Yi for 150 yuan."</p>
<p>Summon Yang Lingzhu. She testified, "I am 12 years old, born in the Year of the Pig, and from Hangzhou. I live at No. 2, Xinchang Road in Hangzhou. I have parents, and my father's name is Yang Debing. Last year in June, my mother sent me to my uncle Yi Fangshuo's house to play. I wanted to learn opera myself. I have not been beaten by Yi." At this point, the court summoned Ye Jinzhu's mother, Ye Li, to the stand. She stated, "Jinzhu was born to my older sister. Because I have no children, she was given to me. I took her in for breastfeeding a few months after she was born. Now my older sister lives in Taiping Lane in Nanjing. My husband, Ye Qiuda, was a section chief during Xu's tenure in the Water Police Bureau. He was previously a soldier on a warship and is away from home. Because I have no son, I sent Jinzhu to Yi's place to learn opera, hoping to rely on her in the future. There is no way I would have sold her to Yi Fangshuo for a price. Please investigate." Furthermore, according to Yang Yi (Yi Fangshuo's sister), "My husband currently works on the Yuhe warship. Lingzhu is from Changbang Village in the countryside. Her father is dead, and her mother has remarried. My mother brought the child to me when she was six years old to be my daughter-in-law. My son is now 11 years old," etc. The court also summoned the original plaintiff, Yi Baozhu, to the stand. The court asked, "Did he beat you while you were learning opera in the defendant's house? Did he monitor your actions?" Yi replied, "I came to Shanghai last November to learn opera, but I couldn't learn it. I wasn't beaten, but he often scolded me. Sometimes when I went out, he would insist that I go with him, otherwise he would scold me, saying that I was going to find a lover," etc. Li Xiaozhen also testified that she came to Shanghai in July of this year to learn to dance. She had not been beaten or monitored. At this point, the court considered the evidence to be complete and ordered the defendant to be brought in, then declared</p>
<p>the beginning of the debate. After the police station's lawyer and the defendant's lawyers debated with each other, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 27th. The defendant was remanded into custody. After the defendant's lawyer repeatedly requested that the defendant be allowed bail, the court refused, stating that the case was proceeding quickly and there were only a few days until sentencing. The defendant then requested to be transferred to the detention center, which the court approved and issued a warrant. The bailiffs took the defendant down and sent him to the detention center. The case has attracted the attention of the entire city of Shanghai. At each hearing, the seats were filled with spectators. Because listening was prohibited, onlookers could not hear the trial. Yesterday's trial had nearly 200 onlookers. Because the case concerned offenses against family and freedom, the court did not prohibit onlookers, causing the Second Court to be very crowded, with barely any room to stand. The court had to disperse the crowd.</p>
<h3>Manager of Jiande Bank Branch Accuses General Manager of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>A Title Deed Used as Security</p>
<p>Never Returned After Resignation</p>
<p>Jiande Bank, located at No. 16, North Henan Road in this city, recently announced its closure due to poor business and financial difficulties, and hired lawyers and accountants to register and liquidate the company. Recently, Jin Jialu, a local resident (36 years old, residing at No. 881, East Youheng Road), the manager of the Jiande Bank branch in Zhonghongqiao, hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Jiande Bank and its General Manager Chai Changgui of embezzling a deposited title deed. The lawsuit requested a judgment according to the law, along with a private prosecution. The main points of the lawsuit stated that the plaintiff was introduced by a friend and hired by Chai Changgui, the General Manager of Jiande Bank headquarters in Shanghai, to serve as the manager of the Zhonghongqiao branch. He initially declined, but was persuaded to try it for a few days. According to custom, a security deposit was required to guarantee the plaintiff's financial responsibilities during his tenure. The plaintiff then deposited title deed No. 13829, registered in England, with the defendant and received a deposit receipt. At that time, the plaintiff stated to the defendant that this title deed was not solely owned by the plaintiff, and that the condition of the deposit was only to guarantee the plaintiff's responsibilities. On November 26th of this year, after the plaintiff went to the branch to oversee matters and audit the accounts, he discovered errors in the accounts and discrepancies in the inventory. He realized that the defendant's hiring of the plaintiff had ulterior motives, so he wrote a letter of resignation on the 3rd of this month to avoid being held responsible for others' mistakes. The defendant replied with a letter of approval, but requested that the title deed, which was deposited as security, be returned within two months. After receiving the letter, the plaintiff was deeply surprised, as the deposit receipt clearly stated that this security item should be returned at the time of resignation. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the title deed had been used by the defendant as collateral. Under these circumstances, the defendant's hiring of the plaintiff as branch manager clearly had illegal intentions. Now, the defendant has privately mortgaged the deposited property, which violates Article 357 of the criminal code. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit requesting that the defendant be summoned to court and punished according to the law, and also filed a civil suit, requesting that the defendant immediately return the title deed deposited by the plaintiff, as well as all damages, etc. Yesterday at around 1:00 PM, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the Third Criminal Court for questioning. The defendant Chai Changgui also surrendered to the court with his lawyer, Cai Liucheng. The plaintiff, Jin Jialu, surrendered to the court and testified to the above circumstances. When questioned, the defendant admitted to mortgaging the title deed, but claimed that he had obtained the plaintiff's consent and that it had been stamped at the time. Judge Wu reviewed the testimony and stated that further investigation was necessary. He adjourned the hearing to 3:30 PM on the 28th at the Second Court. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, stated that the defendant was at risk of fleeing and that the amount involved was quite large, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. He requested that the defendant be ordered to post bail. The court ordered Chai to provide a guarantor to be available upon summons and to await questioning outside.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Maid Abuse Case</h3>

The case was discovered by Chinese Constable No. 469 of the Hongkou Police Station, who, after learning the full story from the girl, reported it to his superior. Detectives were dispatched to escort Chen, along with the evidence, to the First Special District Court for detailed questioning, as reported in this newspaper. The girl was temporarily placed in the Jiliang Institute. The court ordered Chen to be remanded in custody to await sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Chen Wu to a fine of 200 yuan, confiscated the evidence, and ordered that Xu be kept in the Jiliang Institute.

<h3>Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Submits 2,000 Yuan in Public Donations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Schools Continue to Contribute Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Public Donation Association, through the efforts of its general manager and staff over the past two weeks, working day and night, and with the enthusiastic support of all sectors of the city, has achieved remarkable results, as reported in various newspapers. It is reported that yesterday, various schools went to the association to submit donations and receipt stubs, including Qingyun Primary School (2 yuan and 60 cents in silver dollars, 621 copper coins), Wangsi Primary School (2 yuan and 33 cents in silver dollars), Charity Group First Obligatory Primary School (10 yuan and 2 cents in silver dollars, 18 cents in silver dollars), Huaide Primary School (7 yuan and 10 cents in silver dollars), Municipal Rural Primary School (4 yuan and 100 cents in silver dollars), Cunde Primary School (2 yuan and 206 cents in silver dollars), Juequn Primary School (2 yuan and 26 cents in silver dollars), Shezhuang Primary School (2 yuan and 26 cents in silver dollars), Pubin Primary School (5 yuan and 180 cents in silver dollars), Longde Primary School (34 yuan in silver dollars), Xue Mutao Little (26 cents in silver dollars), Yizhao Primary School (4 yuan and 146 cents in silver dollars), Quanzhang Primary School (10 yuan and 253 cents in silver dollars), Zhang Lequan donated 2 yuan in silver dollars, and Qiantai Inn donated 5 yuan in silver dollars. This shows that people from all walks of life deeply sympathize with the disaster-stricken areas and are willing to provide enthusiastic support.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, recognizing the severity of the disasters in various regions and the urgent need for relief, specifically solicited donations from its member stores. They previously inquired with the Emergency Relief Public Donation Association about the procedures for submitting funds. After the association provided detailed instructions, it was reported that yesterday, a special representative submitted 2,000 yuan in public donations. Various trade associations in the business community, after receiving letters from the Emergency Relief Public Donation Association requesting them to make every effort to solicit public donations to help the disaster victims, expressed their deep sympathy and solicited donations separately. In recent days, the donations have been very enthusiastic. Yesterday, the Western Tobacco Industry Association also submitted 200 yuan to the association, demonstrating the general enthusiasm of the business community for emergency relief.</p>
<p>The Emergency Relief Public Donation Association, in order to facilitate donations from all sectors of society, had previously entrusted newspapers, banks, stores, etc., throughout the city to collect public donations on its behalf. Since its implementation, the results have been excellent. Taifeng Biscuit Company on Nanjing Road was also one of the collection points. The company ceased operations some time ago. The Emergency Relief Public Donation Association sent a letter to Xu Yongzuo, the accountant entrusted with the liquidation, requesting that the donations and receipts be sent to the association. It was reported yesterday that Accountant Xu sent the unused receipts and used receipt stubs, as well as 30 yuan in silver dollars and 10 cents in silver dollars, to the association.</p>
<p>It is reported that various factories have deducted donations from workers' wages. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bank submitted 32 yuan and 5 cents from the Mingyi Knitting Factory.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Postpones Ban on Cigarette Coupons</h3>
<p>Ban Effective March 1, 1935</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's order to ban cigarette coupons has been repeatedly petitioned by the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting a reversal of the decision in order to maintain the struggling businesses. The Ministry of Finance has now issued a notice to all factories in all provinces and cities, temporarily allowing the inclusion of coupons in cigarette packs until the end of February 1935. From March onwards, all cigarettes leaving the factory must not include coupons. Those that have already left the factory and been shipped to various places for sale will still be allowed to be sold as usual.</p>
<h3>Revised Price for Multiple Copies of Social Telegrams</h3>
<p>Only Ten Cents for Every Fifty Characters</p>
<p>The prices of domestic social telegrams are low, and all sectors have long been happy to send them. Recently, the Ministry of Communications stipulated that, effective December 25th of this month, the fee for multiple copies of social telegrams (i.e., the fee for sending several copies in the same location) will be changed to ten cents in silver dollars for every fifty characters (previously calculated as two cents in silver dollars for every fifty characters, the same as ordinary telegrams). Less than fifty characters will also be counted as fifty characters, and the price will increase accordingly. The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau in this city notified yesterday that it will be implemented as scheduled. In addition, the social telegrams with celebratory themes this year have been very popular due to the attractive paper, so business is very crowded.</p>
<h3>New Songjiang Society's Perch</h3>
<p>The four-gilled perch is a specialty of Rongcheng, with red gills and jade-like body, resembling the fish in the pond. Perch sashimi and perch soup have long been known to people outside the city, but because there is not much production, many places use other fish to make up the numbers. Now that the winter solstice is approaching, it is the time when perch are on the market. The New Songjiang Society in Songjiang has specially opened a dining hall in the newly built Great Summer Building, and hired famous local chefs to prepare exquisite dishes to meet the demands of people from all over. The local scenery is well-prepared, and the flavor is naturally different. If people from other places want to taste the authentic and unique flavor, why not take a trip and try it? The New Songjiang Society is located dozens of steps east of Songjiang Station, making it very convenient to travel to and from.</p>

The meeting was then adjourned, and the bell had rung six times.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Merchants Request Exemption from Removing Mezzanines</h3>
<p>Petition Submitted to Dongjiadu Police Station Yesterday</p>
<p>Chief Yi Has Agreed to Stop the Removal</p>
<p>Rickshaw merchants in the Qinglong Bridge area of Nanmatou, because the Dongjiadu Police Station has recently ordered the demolition of the mezzanines built by various rickshaw shops, believing that they are prone to danger, and has notified each household through the police, have been in a state of anxiety and cannot live in peace. They have requested the Shanghai Rickshaw Trade Association to submit a report to the city chamber of commerce and request the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to stop the demolition. Yesterday (the 24th) at 8:00 AM, they gathered at a certain teahouse to discuss solutions. Fifty or sixty households attended. Hu Wenqing, Zhu Yutian, and Wang Rongqing were elected as representatives to petition the police station. Chief Yi Zuanren personally received them. The representatives stated that the mezzanines in the rickshaw shops were built because the rent was too expensive and there was no way to accommodate so many rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers come and go from time to time, and if they were to rent houses to live in, it would not only be inconvenient, but also beyond their financial means. Therefore, before the government builds affordable housing for the common people, the demolition of these mezzanines should be stopped in order to ensure the peace of the people and avoid disturbances. Chief Yi considered that the request was based on the facts and ordered the rickshaw merchants to organize themselves to prevent accidents, and agreed to stop the demolition. The representatives were satisfied and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company Reports Mid-Trip Attack</h3>
<p>Were the Perpetrators Impersonating Bandits?</p>
<p>Please Conduct a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The incident in which the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company's last bus from Luodian Town to Shanghai Station was attacked by bandits on the way the day before yesterday evening has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we will reproduce the original telegram from the company to the Baoshan County Government: To Baoshan County Government, County Chief Longxun, On the afternoon of December 22nd, at 5:00 PM, the company's last bus, City Photo No. 958, traveling from Luodian to Shanghai, driven by driver Huang Zhaoqi, was suddenly fired upon by two men in gray military uniforms at the intersection of Dachang City River Bridge and Jiangchang Road. The bullet shattered a piece of glass in the front right corner of the bus and grazed the driver's face, causing great danger. Fortunately, there was only one passenger on the bus, surnamed Xu, who was not hit by the stray bullet. Huang Zhaoqi immediately stopped the bus and asked for the reason. They said that they had orders from their superiors to stop the bus for inspection. They then took off Huang's and the passenger's tops and searched them, finding nothing. They waved the bus to proceed and told Huang that there would be inspectors at Dachang Station. Huang reasoned that even if they wanted to search, they should not have fired a shot suddenly. After arguing for a long time, they dispersed after being persuaded by passersby. When the bus arrived at Dachang Station, it found that the police and security team were densely stationed in front of the station, waiting to inspect the passing vehicles. Huang immediately reported the shooting to the station chief. The local Public Security Bureau Chief Zhou and the captain of the security team stationed there were also at the station. After hearing the news, they believed that it must have been bandits and led the team to the scene of the incident on the bus to investigate, but found no trace of bandits and stopped. According to reports from other drivers of the company (i.e., the last buses from Liuhe, Jiading, etc. returning to Shanghai), on the same day, the last buses passing through the Jiangchang Road intersection were stopped and searched by men in gray military uniforms waiting there. A passenger, Xiting, the vice president of the Liuhe Huizhong Hospital, can testify, because he was also on the last bus and witnessed the search. The search took place at dusk, and the area was not remote. It is strange and serious that bandits dared to impersonate security team soldiers and police, and at the same time conducted the same search on passing vehicles at the same location less than half a mile away. We have specially inspected and photographed the bullet-damaged glass window of passenger car No. 958 and telegraphed the facts truthfully. We hope that you will quickly investigate and ensure transportation and the safety of travelers. The Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company's Manager Zhu Zengyuan and Deputy Manager Hong Bao Ying respectfully request, December 23rd, 1934.</p>

<h3>Tobacco Exchange Association Requests Return of Tongfusheng's Cart</h3>
<p>Submitted to Dongjiadu Police Station Yesterday</p>
<p>Chief Yi Has Agreed to Stop the Removal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association recently received a letter from its member, Tongfusheng Company on Tongfu Road, stating that on the 16th of this month, the company was exchanging copper coins with other companies and was transporting them in its own cart to the store. When passing through Baker Road, the patrolmen of the Xinzha Police Station detained the cart and confiscated it because it did not have a license. Since the company has used the cart, there have been no accidents. It has been found that various companies in the industry have similar vehicles for transportation and have not applied for licenses, and there have been no detentions. For this reason, the association is requested to forward the request to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession to negotiate with the Public Works Department for the return of the cart. The association approved this and forwarded the letter to the Ratepayers' Association. Yesterday, the association received a reply stating: "Dear Sirs, we have received your letter of December 21st requesting the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to return the cart of Tongfusheng Company. We have forwarded the letter to the department to order the police station in charge to handle it."</p>

<h3>Leprosy Association Presents Gifts to National Leprosariums</h3>

<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association customarily presents gifts to national leprosariums every Christmas, benefiting the afflicted, a most commendable practice. In past years, items such as medicines, clothing, sundry goods, radios, etc., were donated, in addition to cash, which amounted to over 4,000 yuan annually.

<h3>Bao Jiuru Abducts a Relative's Daughter</h3>
<p>Lan Ying, the four-year-old daughter of Lu Shi, a woman from Tongzhou residing at No. 605 Huarong Road, disappeared while playing in front of her door at 3:35 PM on the 14th of this month. After a frantic search proved fruitless, she urgently reported the incident to the Yulin Road police station. Detective Li Pengfei and officer Wu Shoushan were dispatched to investigate. On the previous day, the suspects, Bao Jiuru from Tongzhou and Miao Yulin from Changzhou, were apprehended on Yangzhou Road. Miao claimed that the child was at the home of Wang Fuyuan, a Changzhou native, at No. 20 Wengjiatang, Zhabei. The officers then went to the location with detectives from the relevant Public Security Bureau and arrested Wang. Wang confessed that Zhang A'si, a Jiangbei native who ran a matchmaking shop, had arranged the sale to Huo Su, a Guangdong woman residing at No. 47 Dengtuo Road, for 28 yuan. Zhang was subsequently apprehended on Huade Road. Upon questioning Huo Su at her residence, it was revealed that Lu's daughter had been sent to Liang Su, a fellow villager, at No. 320 Public Security Lane, Wusong Road. The child was retrieved, and Huo Su and four other men and women were taken into custody and detained separately. The child was returned to her mother, Lu Shi. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Municipal Council presented the preliminary facts, followed by a report from the Chinese and Western detectives detailing the investigation. The plaintiff, Lu Shi, stated that the defendant, Bao Jiuru, was a relative and had lured Lan Ying away and conspired with Miao, Wang, and Zhang to sell her to Huo Su and others. When questioned, Bao Jiuru confessed that Wang Fuyuan had given Miao 27 yuan after the fact, which was then given to him. Miao Yulin confessed that he was the one who brought Lu's daughter and entrusted Wang Fuyuan to sell her, receiving only three yuan. Wang Fuyuan confessed that Bao brought the girl on the 17th, claiming she was his daughter, and gave evasive answers to other questions. Zhang A'si confessed to receiving only one yuan. Huo Su confessed that her husband had passed away, leaving her with a son, and that she had paid 59 yuan to legally adopt the girl as a daughter-in-law. Both Miao and Wang were present at the time. Wang claimed she was his own daughter, and that he was selling her due to poverty, and signed the agreement. She was unaware she was buying an abducted child and begged for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered Huo Su to post bail of 300 yuan and remanded the others in custody for further investigation at a later date.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Dredging of the Huangzihulu River</h3>
<p>The farmland in the Yangsi Tangqiao area of this city is contiguous. Due to the impact of this year's drought, the autumn harvest has been poor. In addition to petitioning the authorities for a reduction or exemption of land taxes, the Huangzihulu River in the area has not been dredged for many years, which has greatly affected agricultural production. A petition was submitted to the Municipal Government to allocate funds for dredging. The Municipal Government has now ordered the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to take advantage of the current winter slack season to recruit laborers to dredge the river. It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has decided to first send personnel to inspect the site and then immediately begin recruiting laborers to start dredging, hoping to complete the project during this period to benefit agricultural production.</p>

<h3>Pig Trade Mediation Resolves "Exit Fee" Dispute, Slaughtering Not Halted</h3>
<p>Seeking Fundamental Solution for Slaughtering Operations</p>
<p>Petitions to Party and Government Organs and Declaration Issued</p>
<p>Nine pig stalls in this port city, including Huang Shunxing, Wu Yixing, Wanlong, Jiuda, Xingji, Chen Yuexing, Sanxing, Xinglin, and Changshun, collect an "exit fee" of two cents per pig from slaughtering businesses, which has provoked strong opposition from the slaughtering industry. Yesterday was the scheduled start date for the fee collection. All slaughtering businesses in the city unanimously stopped picking up pigs, creating a very serious situation. Later, the pig trade took steps to stop the collection and asked the slaughtering businesses to pick up pigs as usual, averting a halting of slaughtering. The slaughtering businesses sent representatives to petition the Nanjing Municipal Government and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Normal Pig Pickup Resumed: The nine pig stalls in the Nanshi area issued a notice the day before yesterday, stating that ticket sales would begin yesterday and an "exit fee" of two cents per pig would be collected from slaughtering businesses. The slaughtering businesses held a meeting the day before yesterday, resolving that if the fee was collected, they would unanimously stop picking up pigs. After 10:00 AM yesterday, in front of the pig stalls at Xuejia浜, Youche Wharf, Nanshi, the pig stalls hired a large number of non-industry idlers, attempting to force the slaughtering businesses to buy tickets and grab pigs. Seeing this situation, the slaughtering businesses immediately stopped picking up pigs to avoid conflicts. The two sides were at a stalemate, and the situation was very serious. Upon hearing the news, the pig trade believed that the pig stalls' actions would hinder their business. If the slaughtering businesses stopped picking up pigs, meat shops would inevitably purchase pigs from pig trades in Yangjing and Wusong (where pigs are delivered directly to the slaughterhouses without fees). The pig trade would not only have no business but also affect the release of their accounts. The leaders of the pig trade, including Xin Wenyao and Gu Bao, managers of Chunyuan and Changshun, personally went to the scene to strictly stop the pig stalls from collecting the "exit fee," stating that if they did not comply, the stalls would be taken back and operated independently. They also asked the slaughtering businesses to pick up pigs as usual. The slaughtering businesses, having long-standing relationships with the pig trade and unwilling to go too far, picked up pigs as usual under the supervision of the pig trade.</p>
<p>Representatives Sent to Petition: The entire city's slaughtering businesses believe that this so-called "exit fee," which is collected under false pretenses and without any obligation, is unaffordable. Although they are picking up pigs reluctantly under the pig trade's intervention, the issue may resurface if it is not formally abolished. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, they sent representatives Xu Jianzhang, Yu Huitang, Sun A'er, Shen A'er, Yu Bingkun, and others to petition the Municipal Government. They were received by Huang, a section member of the Second Section, who promised to notify the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate. After the representatives left, they went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition. They were received by Mr. Zhu Boyuan. After the representatives stated their intentions, Mr. Zhu promised to have the Business Section investigate and handle the matter. According to the representatives, the slaughtering businesses believe that this matter is of great importance to the future of their industry and have decided to oppose it to the end. They will also petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and issue a declaration today (the 25th), asking all sectors to uphold justice and stop the pig stalls' actions that are hindering the city's meat supply.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read in today's (December 24) news column of your newspaper that "At about 5:00 PM last night, the last bus No. 17 of the Huta Motor Company, traveling from Luodian Town to Shanghai Station, was ambushed by bandits at the north end of Dachang. Zhao Xiting, the director of the Liuhuo Huizhong Hospital, and the former director of the Dachang Public Security Bureau (now the director of the Baoshan First Public Security Bureau), etc., witnessed the bandits wearing gray uniforms." I took the 4:30 PM bus from Jiading to Shanghai at 4:15 PM that afternoon and arrived at Dachang, not the last bus from Luodian to Shanghai. I did not witness the above situation. I am writing to inform you and hope you will make corrections. Sincerely, Wu Zhen, Director of the Baoshan County First Public Security Bureau, December 24.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read in your newspaper's local news column on the 23rd of this month a news item entitled "Dyer Jumps from Building to Commit Suicide," which stated that "Wang Afu, a cashier from Shaoxing in the dye shop, secretly replaced inferior goods for petty gains, etc." Afu is a worker in the finishing department of the Lihe Dyeing Factory. Your newspaper mistakenly referred to him as a cashier in the dye shop, which concerns the reputation of all members of our association. We are writing to you to request that you make corrections. We look forward to it. Sincerely, Shanghai Dyeing Industry Vocational Union Silk and Satin Office, December 24.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read in your newspaper's local news section the story of the Immortal Fighting the Buddha Mother, a touching story of recognizing one's mother. It stated that the witness Li Jinzhang testified in court that he saw the defendant Lu Xiangtian assault the plaintiff Yu Hu. I live next door to Lu Xiangtian. At around 9:00 that day, I heard Yu Hu yelling and making noise upstairs, so I went to advise her. At that time, I saw Yu Hu scolding and making noise upstairs, while Lu Xiangtian was still downstairs. I went upstairs to advise her and saw Yu Hu scratching her face with her left hand in a fit of anger. I did not see Lu Xiangtian assault her. This fact has been stated clearly on record and there is no bias whatsoever. The report in your newspaper does not match the testimony I gave. I hereby request a correction to clarify the responsibility of a witness. Sincerely, Li Jinzhang, December 24.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Sixth Chapter The Poor Girl Is Not Ashamed to Teach, Treating the Western Teacher as Equal, Why Bother with Empty Humility</p>
<p>While Jia Duocai was thinking that, based on the point of touring the Zhou Mausoleum, he must talk about the situation in the Northwest. Unexpectedly, Mr. William changed the subject again. Seeing the Western-style book on the table with Chinese characters embossed in gold, he smiled and said, "Chinese characters are also very beautiful when written on books like this." As he said this, he pointed at the Western-style book with his fingers covered in yellow hair. Jia Duocai was even more confused. Such a conversation was simply like the kind of "the weather is very good today" greetings one would find in Chinese officialdom. He couldn't guess what these two had come for. William himself seemed to realize that his words were somewhat pointless, so he adopted a more serious demeanor and muttered something to Zhao Guofu. Judging from their expressions and eyes, it seemed that they were gradually getting to the main topic. So Jia Duocai also calmed down and listened to what they had to say. Zhao Guofu turned his face, first calling out "Mr. Jia," and then continued, "These two German gentlemen are managing German automobiles in China, and they are selling very well in the Northwest provinces. Mr. Jia, aren't you representing your bank in handling economic cooperation affairs in the Northwest? For example, buying grain, cotton, and the like, you always need automobiles for transportation. If you want to buy automobiles, our cars can be sold to you at an 80% discount." Hearing this, both Jia Duocai and Li Shilian understood. After all this commotion, it turned out that they were peddling business and selling. They hadn't come to visit scholars, let alone investigate the situation in the Northwest. Jia Duocai's careful arrangement and making a big deal out of a small issue was all in vain. Treating two car salesmen with such hospitality, even if no one knew, he still felt ashamed in his heart. He wasn't a poor person like Yueying, and he was free to feel embarrassed. He felt guilty before the gods, and his cheeks turned red. (98)</p>
<h3>Art and Life</h3>
<p>— Ma Foshēng</p>
<p>Zhao Zhiqian, courtesy name Huishu, his epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting are the authorities of the last hundred years. In recent times, only Wu Canglao of Anji can match him because he is known for his real skill and strength! Naturally, the so-called artists who specialize in taking shortcuts and lack real skill cannot hope to reach his level. He was from Dafangkou in Shaoxing City. One of his relatives used to help out at our house for a few days. We asked him to tell us stories about Huishu. According to him, Huishu had originally served as a county magistrate for a term. His epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting were simply his love and were not sold for money, so his works were very rare. At that time, it could truly be said that it was "art for art's sake." Later, because he was not used to bureaucratic flattery, he returned home and no longer served as an official (he had a seal engraved with "not bowing for five pecks of rice"), but his family was very poor and could only make a living through this. It changed to "art for life's sake." However, even so, he still refused to do it for money. He would only start when his wife had no rice to cook. If he had a satisfactory work, he would keep it for his own enjoyment and would not give it to others. Later, his family suffered a fire, and all the collected masterpieces were burned, so his works became even less common. I think that even a great master and artist of a generation was forced by life and could not adhere to his principle of "art for art's sake," and finally ended up with "art for life's sake." Perhaps the artists who are currently shouting loudly for "art for art's sake" may also not be defeated by life!</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Xing Guangyi Donates Remuneration to Aid Disaster Relief)</p>
<p>In this day and age, people follow each other's example, and everyone learns to be clever, thinking themselves clever and treating others as fools. But perhaps the fools will play tricks on the clever ones. Much of it is being clever for one's own sake, and the result is being misled by one's own cleverness.</p>
<p>This is called "hard to be confused."</p>
<h3>Physiognomy</h3>
<p>— Chánchén</p>
<p>Among my friends, there is one called Lao Wang. According to him, he knows everything about the three religions and nine streams, and he is especially good at the art of physiognomy. Although he cannot be compared to Tiangang Chunfeng, he can also be called a "semi-immortal with an iron mouth." When I first met him, he stared at my face with surprised eyes and exclaimed, "Brother, what a face you have! Especially your mouth, it can hold a fist, and you will definitely be rich in the future, but..." Then, he said in a regretful tone, "Unfortunately, there is a haze between your eyebrows, and your luck has not been very good in recent years." Finally, in a definite tone, he said decisively, "Three years from now, you will definitely soar, and then you will know the accuracy of my Lao Wang's physiognomy." After this, my heart was hot for a while, but I just smiled and dismissed it, not taking it seriously. Now, it has been five years since Lao Wang read my face, and I am still drifting in the world and as down on my luck as ever. Lao Wang's physiognomy has never been accurate.</p>
<p>After that, every time I saw him reading someone's face, it was always in this way: first praising or marveling at their appearance. Then regretting their current misfortune, and finally predicting that in a few years, they would definitely be rich or noble. As a result, the people who asked him to read their faces all left happily as if they had received supreme comfort.</p>
<p>Once, when we were drinking merrily, I asked him the secret of physiognomy. He talked eloquently, "Actually, there is nothing remarkable about my art of physiognomy. It's just a matter of remembering the three words 'surprise,' 'sigh,' and 'promise.' No matter who it is, if you praise them for their outstanding appearance, it will always be pleasing to the ear, so the first key to physiognomy is 'surprise,' because this can arouse people's interest. The second is 'sigh.' No matter whether you are successful or not, a person is always dissatisfied. I use this point to touch their hearts, regretting their current misfortune, so that they inevitably regret themselves. Then, my physiognomy has been successful in two-thirds. The final key is 'promise.' Since I have surprised and praised their appearance, and sighed at their misfortune, then I categorically promise that in a few years, they will definitely be rich and noble, giving them a beautiful and long-term check to cash, wouldn't that make them admire me wholeheartedly? Haha! This is the physiognomy secret that has been used for a long time and cannot be seen through."</p>
<h3>Disturbance – Results Obtained in Previous Years</h3>
<p>— Moon</p>
<h3>The Floating Record of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I can't remember the location of this Fox Fairy Pagoda clearly, but it's probably in the northeast corner of Fengtian City. I hope this memory is correct, and even if it's wrong, it won't be too far off. However, I myself admit that I am not very good at recognizing directions. As soon as I get to a place that is relatively unfamiliar, I don't know which way is east and which way is west. Moreover, the streets in Fengtian City are very winding and difficult to recognize. Now that decades have passed, it is naturally not accurate to recall it!</p>
<p>Since the Empress Dowager's will to travel had been decided, orders were issued as usual to inform everyone to prepare. The first step was to send someone to the Fox Fairy Pagoda to drive away idlers to avoid disturbing the Empress Dowager's sacred presence. The second step was to select the route and lay yellow sand on every road that had to be passed to comply with the legal rules. Finally, a well-rehearsed team of honor guards set off in sequence.</p>
<p>I sat in the sedan chair and closed my eyes all the way, thinking carefully about why the myths that I had heard about in other ethnic groups were completely different from our Chinese myths? Whether it's true or false, there should be a reason. Unfortunately, I thought for a long time and couldn't figure it out. Perhaps scholars who specialize in mythology can answer it in a very organized way. I have always paid attention to mythology, but the passage that the Empress Dowager told us above did not arouse my special attention, but only felt very funny and ridiculous!</p>
<p>The procession always moved very slowly. Fortunately, none of us were sick and were not in a hurry to ask the Great Immortal for treatment. It didn't matter if we were slow! Finally, we arrived. (208)</p>

<p>Little Common Sense</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge About the Earth</h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>What exactly is the inside of the Earth, the land we stand on, like? Simply put, it is like the skin of an onion, composed of layers. Broadly speaking, the Earth can be divided into three layers: the outermost layer called the crust, the middle layer, and the core. The crust can be further divided into several layers. The ground we stand on is called the Sial layer. Below this layer is the Sima layer. The Sial layer is composed of rocks made of silicon and aluminum (metallic elements), chemically known as granite and quartz. The Sima layer is made of silicon and magnesium (metallic elements), forming basalt, which is a basic rock. The crust is about 1,200 kilometers thick.</p>
<p>The middle layer, located beneath the crust, can also be divided into two layers: the upper layer is the Chrome-Sima layer, composed of silicon, iron, magnesium, chromium, and other elements; the lower layer is the Silicate-Sima layer, also composed of iron, nickel, silicon, magnesium, and other elements. The middle layer is about 1,700 kilometers thick. This layer is similar to meteorites that fall from the sky.</p>
<p>As for the core, it is called the Nickel-Iron layer, composed of nickel. Some say this layer is a rigid body, very hard, while others say it is a liquid, similar to water. However, no one has been able to drill to the center of the Earth, so we cannot definitively determine what it is like. However, based on observations during earthquakes and studies of tidal phenomena, the center of the Earth must be harder than mud. It is likely a rigid solid.</p>
<p>The ratio of the weight of the Earth's crustal rocks to the specific gravity of the Earth is 2.67 to 5.22. Geologists have found that the specific gravity of the Sima layer is 2.8 to 3.4, the Chrome-Sima layer is 4, the Silicate-Sima layer is 5.6, and the Nickel-Iron layer is 6.2. Those with some knowledge of physics and chemistry will understand this theory.</p>
<p>But how is the Earth's interior divided? Let's use a kitchen knife as an analogy to cut the Earth into two pieces (this is a metaphor, like cutting an apple or an onion, because there is no knife large enough to dissect the Earth). Let me explain. You have probably heard of doctors using X-rays to examine the source of diseases in the body's internal organs. This is similar to how geologists examine the Earth's interior. Although they cannot drill into the Earth, they can study it theoretically, as if it were a transparent glass ball, which they can see very clearly. These scholars use precise seismographs to observe earthquakes (ground movements). For example, when a major earthquake occurs in San Francisco, they can calculate the time it takes for the vibration to travel from the Earth's interior to various places. They can predict when the earthquake will reach Beijing or Shanghai with great accuracy. Those without knowledge might call them gods. In fact, for those who have studied astronomy extensively, it is quite simple. Look at the weather forecasts from the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory. How do they predict whether it will be sunny tomorrow or rainy the day after? It's the same principle.</p>
<p>Geologists can infer from the Earth's layers that there are points between 60 kilometers and 1,200 kilometers below the surface where the density of rocks changes significantly. Also, the density from the surface to a depth of 2,900 kilometers is very different. The first point of difference is the boundary between the Sima layer and the Sial layer. The second point is the boundary between the Sima layer and the middle layer. The third point is the boundary between the middle layer and the Nickel-Iron layer.</p>
<p>The temperature of the Sima layer below the Sial layer is very high, and the pressure is also great. According to ordinary temperature calculations, the center of the Earth has tens of thousands of degrees (geologists estimate between 5,000 and 6,000 degrees Celsius) and a pressure of over 2 million atmospheres. With such a high temperature inside the Earth, the entire Earth has twice the rigidity of iron. Earthquake waves pass through the Earth's interior, and the gravity of the sun and moon causes changes in the Earth's surface water, creating tides. From this, we can infer that the Earth's interior is composed of highly elastic materials.</p>

<h3>Sino-Indian Academic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Tan Yunshan in Contact with Tagore</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 24th) After returning from India, Tan Yunshan, the leader of the Sino-Indian Society, contacted the government about Sino-Indian academic cooperation.

<h3>Anhui Reorganization Education Conference Opens</h3>
<p>(Anhui News) The Anhui Provincial Reorganization Local Education Conference was held at the old site of the Education Department in the auditorium at 2 PM on December 20th. Attendees included Acting Chairman Ma of the Provincial Government, Director of Finance Mao Longzhang, Director of Education Yang Lian, Experts Xie Xunchu, Hao Zhaochu, Luo Jilin, etc., as well as principals of provincial secondary schools and directors of provincial social education institutions, and more than 70 county education directors. Guests included Xiong Wenqin, Chairman of the National Military Training Association, and Jiang Wei, a scribe from the Gazetteer Hall. Chairman Yang Lian and Vice Chairman Zheng Hecun first reported the purpose of the meeting, saying roughly that Anhui Province's local education is far inferior to that of other places with good results, and recently there is even the suffering of having no way out. Anhui Province's local education funds originally totaled 2.3 to 4 million yuan, but this year's drought has reduced them by 6 to 700,000 yuan, and the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes will reduce them by another 5 to 600,000 yuan, a total reduction of half. 70% of the 2.2 million elementary school students will drop out of school. Now we need to discuss: 1. How to make up for the funding gap, 2. How to prevent children from suffering from dropping out of school, 3. How to integrate productive education with compulsory education, 4. How to test the methods that are currently being tested or have achieved results in various provinces and cities. After the report, Chairman Ma gave instructions, and Director Mao and Xunchu gave speeches, followed by a reply from Zhou Zhenhua, a representative of the members. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM. At 6 PM, the provincial government hosted a banquet for all members, and the provincial party department also scheduled a reception for all members.</p>
<h3>Student National Goods Year Opening Meeting Yesterday, Various Groups Initiated</h3>
<p>Revised Organizational Outline, Formally Appointed Directors</p>
<p>Preparing for the Opening Ceremony on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>The Student National Goods Year, initiated and prepared by educational and commercial circles in this city, held an inaugural meeting of various groups at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 3:00 PM yesterday. The meeting revised the organizational outline, formally appointed directors, and discussed preparations for the New Year's Day opening ceremony. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>List of Participating Groups: Present were Pan Gongzhan from the Municipal Education Bureau, Wang Longzhang and Huang E from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Peng Zhenqiu from the Social Affairs Bureau, Huang Zaoxiong from the Municipal Education Office, Zhang Taoyong from the University Federation, Kang Xuanyi from the University Education Federation, Chen Jicheng from the Middle School Education Federation, Zheng Xigu from the Middle School Advancement Association, Yu Zuoting and Zheng Chengqing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xuefan and Long Peiyun from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Huang Renzhi from the Municipal Local Association, Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, Pan Yangyao from the Vocational Education Society, Chen Yiting from the Promote National Goods Association, Fang Yexian from the China National Development and Sales Association, Yu Xinyi from the Daily Newspaper Association, Sun Daosheng from the Journalists Association, Sun Choucheng from the National Goods Factory Federation, Wu Shuxing from the China General Industry Association, Wu Zhihao from the Shanghai National Goods Company, Huang Bingpei from the Family Renewal Society, Hua Wanruo from the Women's National Development Association, and over fifty people including Ren Jinpin and Yang Jiaoqi.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Remarks: Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Recorder Ren Jinpin. The chairman first delivered a speech, saying, "The initiation of this Student National Goods Year is because, considering the national goods movement since its implementation last year and this year being the Women's National Goods Year, it has achieved considerable success. Although some people believe that import and export trade has a yearly deficit, they think the national goods movement is still ineffective. Others believe that this year is the Women's National Goods Year, yet the import of cosmetics is astonishing, further leading them to believe that the national goods movement has no effect at all. However, they do not realize that if there had been no enthusiastic people promoting and implementing national goods in the past two years, the import deficit of foreign goods would probably have been even worse. Furthermore, the increased quantity of import deficits in recent years should not be attributed to the lack of effort by those engaged in the national goods movement. For example, the surge in gasoline imports due to the construction of domestic highways is one instance. Although the quantity of imported cosmetics has increased recently, the flourishing success of national cosmetics today is undoubtedly due to the efforts of the women's community in promoting national goods. Therefore, the national goods movement is better to do than not to do, and better to put in effort than not to put in effort. With this in mind, colleagues have scheduled next year as the Student National Goods Year, because students are pure and youthful, with great power of action. By setting an example and awakening compatriots, the effect will surely increase," and so on.</p>
<p>Discussion of Important Matters: After the chairman's speech, Chen Jicheng reported on the preparatory process. Then, the proposals were discussed: (1) Proposal to determine the name: It was resolved to name it the "Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation." (2) Proposal to determine the organizational outline: It was resolved to revise and approve it. (3) Proposal to determine the work outline: It was resolved to revise and approve it. (4) Proposal to appoint directors and conveners of the board of directors: It was resolved to formally approve the list and elect Pan Gongzhan, Fang Yexian, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Shouyong, and Yu Zuoting as conveners. (5) Proposal for preparations for the New Year's Day opening ceremony: It was resolved to entrust it to the preparatory committee. (6) Proposal to raise funds: It was resolved that the two major Shanghai Chinese national goods companies would temporarily advance 500 yuan as preparatory funds. (7) Proposal to elect the presidium for the opening ceremony: It was resolved to elect twelve people, with the list recorded separately. After the discussion, tea and refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Revised Organizational Outline: The revised organizational outline of the Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation is as follows: (1) This association is jointly initiated by educational and commercial groups. Based on the year's theme of the national goods movement, it is named the "Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation." (2) The purpose of this association is to promote the inherent patriotic spirit of students, awaken the public to use national goods, and unite with commercial and industrial circles to work together to promote the national goods movement. (3) Members of this association are schools, national goods factories, national goods stores, and organizations enthusiastic about national goods. Each joining member will send one to two representatives. (4) Membership fees for this association are voluntarily contributed by each member. (5) This association will have a board of directors, whose members will be appointed by public agreement of the initiating groups. The board of directors will decide to appoint committee members from the designated representatives to form the following committees: 1. School Committee; 2. National Factory Committee; 3. National Goods Store Committee; 4. Economic Committee; 5. Design Committee; 6. Publicity Committee. The School Committee may establish branches within each school. 7. This association may hire staff as needed to carry out the intentions of the board of directors, serving the various committees. 8. The regulations for the board of directors and various committees of this association will be established separately. 9. Matters not covered in this outline may be added, deleted, or modified by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Revised Work Outline: The revised work outline of the Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation is as follows: 1. Realize the objectives of the Student National Goods Year; 2.

<h3>German Secondary School Teacher Training (II)</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhen Sun</p>
<p>(II) Methods of Secondary School Teacher Training</p>
<p>Regarding German secondary school teacher training, teachers can be divided into two types. The first type is teachers of general subjects who have graduated from universities or higher vocational schools. The second type is teachers of special subjects such as physical education, art, and applied art. The training received by these teachers is lower than that received by teachers from universities, and in terms of remuneration and priority, they only hold a secondary position in secondary schools. The main force in German secondary schools is mostly occupied by the first type of teachers, so we will take this type of teacher as the object of our research.</p>
<p>Unlike other European countries, Germany does not have a national education ministry. Germany is a federal state composed of sixteen organizations, and they have autonomy over education, judicial administration, and certain taxation. However, they all abide by the provisions of the national constitution promulgated on August 11, 1919. However, the autonomous education departments of all federal states are now completely consistent with the imperial education department established in 1871. Therefore, secondary school diplomas are still valid throughout Germany, as are university degrees. The curriculum, academic programs, and teaching process of secondary education are uniform everywhere, so they can be used for a kind of exchange class (Kassenauslausch) experiment. This alternating class experiment is that students from secondary schools in different cities in Germany (such as Munich and Hamburg) can exchange classes. For example, students from academic or science-based secondary schools in Munich can study for several weeks under the guidance of teachers from similar secondary schools in Hamburg, and students from schools in Hamburg can similarly study in similar schools in Munich. This method does not prejudice the academic progress of ordinary students because the level of work in each secondary school is very uniform.</p>
<p>Regarding the selection and training methods of German secondary school teachers, for the convenience of discussion, it is best to take Prussia as the standard. The training of secondary school teachers in Prussia is stipulated by national examinations. This national examination consists of two parts: 1. Degree examination; 2. Teacher examination.</p>
<p>1. Degree examination: This examination is organized in accordance with the decrees of the Prussian Education Ministry of July 27, 1917, January 2, 1926, January 19, 1927, October 15, and February 4, 1930. The following are the necessary conditions for candidates:</p>
<p>(1) Secondary school diploma</p>
<p>(2) Eight semesters of study at a German university, three of which must be at a Prussian university.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to taking major and minor subjects at the university, candidates must also attend lectures in philosophy and education.</p>
<p>(4) Candidates must have personally participated in practical physical exercises for two semesters and received two semesters of physical education lectures.</p>
<p>This examination is presided over by a special committee designated by the Education Ministry. All committee members are mostly professors from universities and secondary education experts. The position of chairman is often held by secondary education experts. The chairman of the examination committee is legally empowered to make decisions, and he decides whether to allow candidates to participate in the examination. He can reject the request of any candidate whose conditions do not meet the regulations. The chairman's decision can only be vetoed by the Minister of Education.</p>
<p>The examination subjects are divided into ordinary and special subjects. The special subjects are designated by the candidates themselves. These special subjects are divided into three types: two major and one minor. Candidates can choose two major subjects from the following: Christian doctrine, German, Latin, Greek, French, English, history, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. Candidates can choose one minor subject from the following: Introduction to philosophy, political science, education, applied mathematics, geology, mineralogy, history of medieval and modern art, comparative linguistics, Polish, Swiss, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Turkish, Dutch, religious history, and Chinese.</p>
<p>There are two methods of examination: written and oral. The written examination is divided into two types: 1. Writing two essays; 2. On-site examination. As for the two essays, there are also major and minor distinctions. The topic of the major essay is selected from the candidate's major subjects, and the topic of the minor essay is selected from the minor subject. Candidates have five months to prepare for the major essay and three months to prepare for the minor essay. With the permission of the chairman of the examination committee, the preparation time for the major essay can be increased by six weeks, and the preparation time for the minor essay can be increased by four weeks. If the examination committee believes that the candidate's essay has special and profound value, he can be exempted from all or part of the on-site examination. The examination time is set at three hours. During the examinations between 1929 and 1930, among the 872 candidates, 92 were exempted from all on-site written examinations due to the special value of their essays.</p>
<p>The oral examination is conducted separately by another committee. This committee consists of at least three people, namely the chairman, the examiner, and the recorder. The recorder's duty is to record the candidate's answers in detail. The results of each examination are indicated by four grades: excellent, upper, middle, and lower. If a subject is failed, the candidate can apply for a makeup examination. The method of makeup examination is determined by the committee. Applicants for makeup examinations should pay a makeup examination fee of eight marks. Those who pass the examination can obtain a secondary school teacher's degree. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>"Selected Works"</h3>
<p>— Zai Qing</p>
<p>In the "Society Talk" section of "Literature," there was a short essay "On Selected Works," explaining the disarray and repetition of current selected works, and hoping that those who select books would explore new paths and not just spin around in this narrow circle. This opinion is completely correct. In the article "On Essays Selection" (Literary Landscape), I once referred to such books as "selected works of selected works." Now that I think about it, I feel that I have to add a little explanation, that is, it does not mean "more carefully selected," but rather arbitrarily selecting from selected works, putting together a miscellaneous book, and fundamentally there is no "selection."</p>
<p>Selected works are a big deal, and they are also more effective and more immortal than individual collections. Many collections of writings can be lost, but good selected works are often not easily destroyed. The reason is: selected works concentrate the essence of each author's works, allowing readers to understand more things with less economic expense and less time. But such selected works are definitely not of the kind of "arbitrarily selected, putting together a miscellaneous book." Therefore, the benefits of selected works are many, if the selector is excellent and willing to treat selecting books as a career and do it carefully.</p>
<p>The pity is that there are not many such selectors, so that "speculative and shoddy" selected works often appear on the market. That is why people who buy books select and select in the pile of selected works, but in the end they cannot select anything. The reason for this phenomenon is not simple. There is a relationship with the development of the printing industry, the business sense of publishers, and also the lives of selectors. Under various complex conditions, it is impossible to eliminate this phenomenon. The only way to remedy this is to painstakingly put in the effort to criticize and select selected works, and constantly supervise and liquidate. This responsibility should be borne by critics.</p>
<p>There is a very bad trend in the Chinese publishing industry, which is that it is unwilling to develop in different directions, and often jointly bites the same book, desperately fighting, and will not stop until both sides are injured. For example, the "Twenty-Four Histories," "Twenty-Five Histories," and "Twenty-Six Histories" are examples of this. Therefore, if publisher A makes a profit from a selection of essays, publisher B will also make another one, and publisher C will be a little envious and add one to join in the fun. If this continues to develop, it will inevitably lead to everyone selling essays, everyone buying essays, and even if it is not an essay, it will be forcibly counted as an essay, and China will be made into an essay country. There is definitely no situation where you publish the "Complete Works of Yuan Zhonglang" and I do not print it, but print the collection of another person. The publishing of selected works is so bad and the scope is so narrow. This trend in the publishing industry is, I think, a big reason. The publisher's demand for "production machinery" is so high, and the selector is forced by life to adapt to the other party's demands, which is very impossible. I hope that selectors can develop new paths, and at the same time, I have to hope that publishers can change this bad trend.</p>
<h3>On the Riverbank (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Mo Fu</p>
<p>"There must be a village ahead!"</p>
<p>Finally, in the dim moonlight, we spotted some dark shapes and shouted out in surprise. As we drew closer, barking dogs grew louder, confirming our guess. Our spirits lifted, and our breathing became easier.</p>
<p>In reality, it wasn't much of a village, just a few scattered thatched huts. Trees were scarce, and there was hardly a street to be seen. The dogs barked more fiercely, but it was a monotonous sound, revealing the small number of residents in the village. Was there an inn? Which one was it? We were worried about how to solve this problem because we were strangers in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>"This is an inn!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a companion standing in front of a large door shouted joyfully, showing a liveliness he hadn't had before. I almost felt like jumping for joy. We started shouting loudly and pounded on the faded, peeling black oil door with our hands and feet. But no matter how hard we tried, it remained quiet inside, with no response, which made us anxious. Most of our companions sat on their luggage, heads drooping, feeling helpless. But were we willing to give up? After a while, we started knocking again.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Suddenly, a rough voice asked.</p>
<p>"Guests! Open the door quickly!"</p>
<p>We stopped knocking, and there was no more sound from inside. So, one by one, we pleaded towards the door, explaining how we had crossed the river, why we couldn't enter the wharf, where we had landed, and so on. Unexpectedly, we heard a sound of "hmm" from inside the door. As the door opened, an elderly man with a sallow face and a beard appeared. He was stunned by the sight of our group of people. Naturally, I couldn't wait for him to ask any questions, so we crowded in.</p>
<p>The courtyard was spacious. On the left was a row of factory buildings, with troughs for feeding livestock. At one end, several animals were munching on grass. Two carters emerged from under the factory building, their sheepskin blankets draped loosely over their shoulders, and asked us about our journey in a nasal, mumbled way.</p>
<p>The old man with the beard reappeared and, as the innkeeper, led us into a three-room empty house lit by a dim kerosene lamp.</p>
<p>Only then did we regain our composure, shake off our fears, and feel the gnawing pain of our long-empty stomachs. "Snacks? We're starving."</p>
<p>"Innkeeper, hot water!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the empty house became lively. To warm up, the innkeeper started boiling water in the house. While munching on food, everyone talked loudly about what they had seen, felt, and imagined on the riverbank, their faces showing a unique joy after the initial shock. Every time they talked about something frightening, they couldn't help but tighten their lips and widen their eyes.</p>
<p>I sat in front of the fire, staring blankly at the old man boiling water, recalling the experience of crossing the river. The most terrifying part wasn't my own timidity and self-frightening, but the arrow-like rapids, the roaring of the angry waves against the riverbank, the helplessness of being unable to escape on horseback, and the precariousness of traveling on a broken wooden boat along the riverbank, with the possibility of death at any moment. At that moment, I truly understood the saying "The farther you go across the Yellow River, the more afraid you become." (The End)</p>
<h3>The "Origin" of a Buddhist Image Emerging from a Clam Shell</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shuxuan</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen Zizhan's "Buddhist Image Emerging from a Clam Shell" was published, Mr. Jiang Hongyi provided a "scientific explanation," and Mr. A Ying collected materials. Thus, it is evident that this article has attracted some attention. Those unaware that the Buddhist image in the clam shell "is artificially crafted" naturally find it strange (see Mr. Chen's "Postscript" in the 5th issue). However, its shadow cannot escape the eyes of folklorists! We can see Mr. Chen's emphasis on this matter and his "textual research" in his repeated postscripts. But since he insists on researching whether it "has an origin" (see "Buddhist Image Emerging from a Clam Shell" in the October 4th issue), I will also bring up some "dead people" (historical sources).</p>
<p>Yang Yu's "New Talks from a Mountain Dwelling" mentions that Emperor Wenzong of Yuan liked to eat clams and saw a Bodhisattva image inside one. Mr. Chen suspects that this refers to Emperor Wenzong of Yuan; the "Records of the Transmission of the Lamp" says it was Emperor Wenzong of Tang. However, since Yang Yu states that Emperor Wenzong "placed the clam image in a sandalwood box and presented it to Xing'an Temple, ordering respect for it," we can compare it with what Tang's Grand Master Duan Chengshi said in "Miscellanies from Youyang, Continued":</p>
<p>"In Jingshan Ward, the Daxing'an Temple... Looking to the left: there is a clam image, traditionally said to be from the time of the Sui Emperor, who was fond of clams and consumed them in countless numbers. Suddenly, one clam was struck as usual, but the Emperor found it strange. He placed it on the table, and overnight it shone brightly. By morning, the meat had separated, and inside was an image of a Buddha and two Bodhisattvas. The Emperor was filled with remorse and vowed never to eat clams again!!" (Volume 5, Record of Temples and Pagodas)</p>
<p>Doesn't this say that the Xing'an Temple still had the clam image during the Tang Dynasty? Although it doesn't explicitly say that the Sui Emperor "presented it to Xing'an Temple," historically, the construction of temples and pagodas was most flourishing during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui. Therefore, this question can be answered quite appropriately. Furthermore, this shows that the origin of the clam image dates back to Emperor Wen of Sui! It originated as early as the Sui Dynasty! In the same volume, Chengshi also includes a twenty-character couplet about the clam image, which mentions "a sacred pillar with traces of iron chains." I wonder if this refers to the "sacred pillar" in Xing'an Temple? Perhaps it can be found in the "Records of Buddhist Temples in Jinling," but unfortunately, I don't have that book at hand and cannot investigate it further.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of this matter, the Sui Dynasty is undoubtedly the earliest, but it cannot be said to be its true source, as it is related to the superstition of animal worship. The manifestation of the divine in animals also carries a didactic meaning. However, on the other hand, it is the result of the clam itself being regarded as a sacred and extraordinary object. In the "Monthly Ordinances of the Book of Rites," it says, "In the month of late winter, pheasants enter the great water and become mirages." The "mirage" is a large clam, which is also a shellfish. Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty commented on the Erya dictionary, saying, "A shellfish is a mirage." Xing Bing of the Song Dynasty explained, "A mirage is a large clam" (Annotations and Explanations of Fish in the Erya Dictionary). Shellfish and clams were originally the same thing, differing only in size and name. Moreover, it's not just that "pheasants become mirages, and sparrows become shellfish" (from the "Discussion on Immortals" in the Baopuzi; due to space limitations, I cannot elaborate further here). Gao You's commentary on the Huainanzi also mentions, "The Fangzhu is a large clam. If you rub it until it is hot and face it towards the moon, water will be generated," which is quite mysterious! Thus, it became a tool in Taoist naturalistic theories; thus, it became related to the alchemy of the alchemists; and thus, during the Ming Dynasty, there were records of images of the Eight Immortals, the God of Longevity, etc., appearing in clam shells (see Zheng Zhongkui's "Junque").</p>
<h3>Fine Wine and Women</h3>

<h3>Coming from Volcano Master (4)</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>"Ah... It's really hard to walk! The sand has filled my feet." They had all arrived, chatting and giggling. Upon their reminder, I realized that my shoes were also full of sand. I thought about sitting down to empty them, but then I realized that my feet would just fill up with sand again, so why bother wasting the effort.</p>
<p>Indeed, only now did I truly feel that life in the desert was too difficult! The vast desert stretched out before you, with not a single tree, blade of grass, or bird in sight. My throat was so parched it felt like it was on fire, yet there was no way to find a drop of water in the desert. I deeply regretted not eating all the fruit earlier, as it would have been such a joy to use it to quench my thirst now.</p>
<p>Each step sank into the sand, covering your legs. You had to exert all your strength to pull your feet out and take another step, but every step was just as difficult, just as impossible to drag your feet forward.</p>
<p>Thus, pain and annoyance arose!</p>
<p>Watching the ant-like crowd winding their way across the mountain ridge, I envied their ability to walk while I couldn't catch up, a wish unfulfilled. But the sand seemed to deliberately make things difficult for you. The more you wanted to walk faster, the more your feet were buried in the sand, unable to be pulled out. What made you even more anxious was the northerly wind, as sharp as scissors, constantly blowing. Countless fine grains of sand stung your face like hailstones—no, almost like shrapnel. Eyes, nostrils, ears... sand was everywhere. Your hair was completely covered in sand, and as you walked, it scattered down like sand snow.</p>
<p>I was now breathless and could no longer catch up with them, often stopping involuntarily. Several times I fell onto the sand, losing consciousness as if I had developed a tumor. Mr. Qin, waiting impatiently ahead, desperately urged us forward with his stick. My spirit was so exhausted that I couldn't lift my feet anymore. But my mind was still clear. It told me that stopping here was absolutely impossible, that the journey back was even longer than going forward, and that we hadn't even seen the volcano yet. I was determined not to give up.</p>
<h3>Mount Yilie</h3>
<p>— Shi Dai</p>
<p>"Rolling the Ball of Silk."</p>
<p>"Let's go! Let's go see 'Rolling the Ball of Silk'!"</p>
<p>Many people were shouting, drawn by the strange spectacle towards Mount Yilie. Children were also eagerly moving their hands and feet, wanting to see this rare "once-in-a-century" event; however, the adults stopped these children, even though they cried and wailed, they were not allowed to go there! The children struggled frantically, resulting in the adults locking them up in the yurt, where they continued to cry and make noise.</p>
<p>Everyone understood that the death penalty of "Rolling the Ball of Silk" was the most cruel! This cruelty not only inflicted terrible suffering on the prisoner, but also caused pain in the hearts of the viewers! Children's minds are fragile, and it would be dangerous if they were exposed to such stimulation!</p>
<p>The sky was covered in thick clouds, frighteningly gloomy, and the sun was hidden behind them. A wind, having turned from wild to sharp, pricked at the skin and bones. The reflection of the snow illuminated the sky, turning the dense clouds a grayish-white color, swirling and preparing to scatter snowflakes onto the earth.</p>
<p>The vast plains, the towering mountains, and the yurt-like mounds were all dressed in pure white.</p>
<p>The crowd wriggled on the snow, looking like fly droppings on a white tablecloth from afar, little by little. They walked, walking quickly. The white Mount Yilie was already packed with dark figures.</p>
<p>The prisoner's arms were tied behind him, and he leaned crookedly on the snow. His face was devoid of color, his eyes glazed over, and his lips were dry and almost gone.</p>
<p>"He's quite young!" someone said.</p>
<p>More and more people gathered, each pushing aside the shoulders and arms of others, clearing their line of sight. It seemed that at this moment, everyone had forgotten the cold.</p>
<p>"What did he do to commit such a crime?"</p>
<p>It was the old man from Lasar Island asking someone.</p>
<p>After a long pause, a young man replied:</p>
<p>"He stole twenty horses from King Sayan!"</p>
<p>"How bold! Daring to steal King Sayan's livestock!"</p>
<p>Various discussions emerged from the people's mouths, only whispered private discussions, with fear jumping in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>A commotion began as a large group of people climbed up from the foot of the mountain. King Sayan, wearing a shiny purple robe and a face-illuminating yellow jacket, walked majestically to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>"Clear the way! Clear the way!"</p>
<p>The mounted guards with guns shouted loudly, clearing the crowd.</p>
<p>King Sayan dismounted, and the guards swarmed around him. A guard with a pockmarked face went to drag the prisoner to King Sayan. The prisoner was like a dead pig, not moving or making a sound.</p>
<p>Before long, King Sayan clasped his hands together and held the Buddhist rosary, announcing the prisoner's crimes to everyone:</p>
<p>"Irat Ussuri is a very bad person. He doesn't believe in the sky god Chao Ma! He doesn't keep to his duties and steals other people's livestock everywhere! He even dared to steal my livestock! The 'Living Buddha' told me that this person must be punished with 'Rolling the Ball of Silk'! Otherwise, the people of our Kuku Plain will not be able to live in peace!"</p>
<p>Everyone seemed not to have heard King Sayan's words, scanning the dying prisoner Irat Ussuri with eyes hiding fear.</p>
<p>"Do it!"</p>
<p>The shout came from King Sayan's mouth. The guards rudely tied a long, round blue stone weighing a hundred or so pounds to the prisoner's body with a leather rope, then ruffled the prisoner's hair and poured some kerosene on it. King Sayan shouted:</p>
<p>"Release!"</p>
<p>Then, the pockmarked man lit the oil on the prisoner's hair with a torch, causing flames to rise. Two people came over, lifted the prisoner forcefully, and threw him down the mountain with all their might! Flames flickered as the prisoner's body tumbled straight from the mountaintop to the bottom of the mountain. King Sayan laughed heartily and triumphantly mounted his chestnut horse.</p>
<p>A sense of desolation enveloped the hearts of every spectator, leaving traces of pity on their faces. The old man from Lasar Ude wiped his tears and patted a middle-aged man beside him, saying:</p>
<p>"Pray to the Living Buddha for protection! We must not break the law!"</p>
<p>The middle-aged man lowered his head, thinking about the changes in this tragic scene. He seemed not to have heard the old man's words.</p>
<p>The sky was gloomy, and the air was stagnant! Sadness hung on people's faces as they dejectedly walked down Mount Yilie.</p>
<p>Irat Ussuri's corpse lay stiff on the snow, the white snow smeared with red blood, the ropes broken. The face was a bloody mess, and it was no longer possible to distinguish the nose from the mouth.</p>
<h3>Cocoon (4)</h3>
<p>— Original by Hayashi Fusao, translated by Shizuko</p>
<p>Sakai's mother, a woman with quiet, old-fashioned eyebrows, spoke in a very kind tone, repeatedly saying how much Yūichi had always been in his care and asking for his continued support in the future, while bowing her already graying head in front of me. Embarrassed and ashamed, my face flushed red, I just nodded repeatedly, not daring to look directly at Sakai's mother's face, which expressed elegance and humility.</p>
<p>On the way home from the factory, Sakai told me about his experiences in a very quiet tone. His father had died when he was in the fourth grade of elementary school, leaving behind his mother and him. Since his father's death, their once reasonably comfortable family had completely fallen apart. For several years, they had relied solely on his mother's hands to raise him. To send him to middle school, his mother had become a factory worker in a silk mill. Although he stubbornly refused to go to middle school, the teachers at school all advised that it would be a pity to drop out halfway, and his mother said that he was the only one who could revive the Sakai family. Such tearful pleadings had led him to start school. However, to pay the tuition, his mother had no choice but to wear down her aging body in such an unhealthy factory. He didn't want to go to school at all. His mother's monthly wage was barely enough to cover his tuition, but if he dropped out, it would disappoint his mother, who was working with a full heart of hope. So, partly out of necessity and partly out of gratitude, he was attending school.</p>
<p>"I have never told anyone about this. Nor is there any need to tell anyone. But you—only you—are very dear to me. I often talk about you with my mother, and she always says, while shedding tears, that she wants to meet you and thank you, no matter what. That's why I invited you here today."</p>
<p>".................................................................................................."</p>
<p>"Also," Sakai continued immediately, "there is another reason why I took you to that factory. Perhaps you have already noticed. The owner of that factory is the father of Ōkawa, the man I stabbed with a knife before."</p>
<p>"Ah," I nodded.</p>
<p>"Therefore, I think what I did before was not very good. It is, of course, despicable to bully the weak without reason, but it is also cowardly to retaliate with personal feelings. If Ōkawa hadn't been in that group—if Ōkawa, who mocked my mother for working in his factory, hadn't been there—I wouldn't have drawn my knife. By the time I realized it, I couldn't help but cry at my own cowardice."</p>
<p>I gazed at the blood-red sunset slowly sinking into the sea from the top of the street houses, listening quietly to his words as I watched.</p>
<p>Two or three years passed.</p>
<p>We were both now students at a higher school. Sakai had received a scholarship from the prefecture, and I had somehow passed the entrance exam without incident.</p>

<h3>Financial Leverage Loosens, Gold Standard Premium Drops Another $2.90</h3>
<p>Currency Market Stiffens, Trading Loosens</p>
<p>Daily Situation: Easier to Fall Than Rise</p>
<p>Since last Saturday, after the Kwong group vigorously sold gold bars, the gold market's leverage loosened yesterday, making it easier to fall than rise. The currency market also stiffened, retreating into the $80 range before stabilizing with scattered transactions. Early morning, overseas silver markets saw slight rebounds in both London and New York, with forward silver prices also rising and exchange rates slightly increasing. London spot gold fell 2.5 pence, reflecting a slight rebound in sentiment after last Saturday's sharp decline. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened higher at $88.80, but due to eager supply at higher prices, it gradually declined. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar up $0.0625. Customs gold units contracted 2.5 pence, and the listed standard price for the gold premium retreated to $1013.20. The morning opening was still high, initially appearing stable, but then softened due to the loosening currency market and oversupply in the market. The Central Bank and others took advantage of lower prices to cover their positions. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) kept its British and American exchange rates unchanged. Afterwards, it turned from stable to firm, rising briefly. However, the Bank of Communications (BOCOMM) had an appetite for supply exceeding demand, keeping the domestic market firm, and selling pressure continued, pushing prices back into the $80 range. The announced silver equalization tax remained unchanged at 5.75%. With the British exchange rate calculated at 1 shilling and 5.25 pence, there was not much impact, with a slight upward pull. However, due to the still stiff currency market and weak sentiment, prices retreated again into the $80 range. Later, HSBC took advantage of lower prices to vigorously buy shillings, managing to maintain prices. Major players also aggressively replenished their positions, gradually rising back above $80. Despite some struggles afterwards, sentiment had slightly stabilized, and the domestic market softened slightly. By noon, the underlying trend had solidified, and the off-exchange market rose immediately. After the market opened, conditions were stable, hovering around $3.00. Later, due to slight withdrawals by banks, fluctuations increased briefly, but prices rebounded due to buying activity at lower levels. Afterwards, although speculator Luo sold, prices gradually fell, but buyers remained inactive, resulting in an extremely stable situation. Finally, due to the market close, the currency market was calm, and gold market transactions were sparse, leading to a stagnant state lacking change. Overall, sentiment had not stabilized, and although the currency market loosened, it was not by much, with the trend appearing to hover. Swap spreads fell, with short positions gaining about $13.00 yesterday. Today's market conditions will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening at $986.80, up $1.00 from last Saturday. Fu Xing Yong and Yu Xin Xiang sold, retreating from $7.00 to $6.00. Yong Li and Zhao Feng Chang accepted bars, rising back to $7.20. Fu Xing Yong, Yong Feng, Da Fa Yong, Heng Yu, and Fu Yu all sold. The currency market loosened, dropping to $2.20. Heng Xing Yuan and Heng Yu accepted bars, with banks trading amongst themselves, rising to $3.20. Fu Xing Yong and Qian Chang Xiang still sold, dropping to $2.00, mainly because the U.S. dollar for January could be settled at $68.75. The Central Bank took advantage of lower prices to cover positions, and the U.S. dollar for January could be settled at $75. Yuan Mao Yong, Yong Li, and Fu Xing Yong came to buy, rising back to $4.50. Shen Kang, Da Fa Yong, Da De Cheng, and Yong De still sold, dropping $1.00. Da Tong and others vigorously bought spot U.S. dollars at $34.3125 but failed. It was anticipated that HSBC would keep its British and American exchange rates unchanged. At this time, the situation was still stable. Later, Qian Chang Xiang, Han Heng, Fu Xing Yong, Shun Mao, Zhao Feng Chang, Xiang He, and others joined forces to advance bars, rising back to $6.20. Da Fa Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Xing Yuan, Yu Qing Yong, Chang Da, Da De Cheng, and others sold bars. Korea was willing to offer U.S. dollars for January at $68.75, gradually retreating into the $80 range. U.S. dollars for January could be settled at $75, falling to $79.30. Fu Xing Yong and Heng Yu took advantage of lower prices to accept bars, gradually pulling up. The silver equalization tax announcement did not move, and prices rose to $81.90. Zhejiang was willing to offer shillings for April at .025. Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Xing, and Yu Li sold, retreating to $.07. Heng Yu, Ding Chang, and Da De Cheng still advanced, rising back to $2.40. Ding Kang, Da Fa Yong, and Fu Xing Yong came to sell bars again, later dropping to $79.50. Qian Chang Xiang and Fu An bought, rising to $80.05. After entering, U.S. dollars for March at $0.25 were offered by Macao Lee. Heng Yu and Qian Chang Xiang vigorously sold bars, falling to $78.20. HSBC struggled to buy shillings for March at $1.25. Although Hui Xiang sold, Wan Xing, Fu Xing Yong, Fu Chang, and Yong Li bought, rising to $80.08. Although there was a fallback, the general trend struggled around $80. Later, Heng Yu, Fu Xing Yong, and Heng Tai accepted bars, rising again to $82. Qian Chang Xiang sold aggressively with limited orders, gradually declining again. Fu Yu and Zhao Feng Chang came to sell, dropping to $79.80. The currency market gradually softened. Yu Qing Yong and Da De Cheng came to advance, rising to $82.50. Although Da Fa Yong sold, there was still demand for U.S. dollars for February at $43.75, and the general trend was still stable. The noon close was $982.20, and the market was even more stable after the close.</p>
<p>The after-market opening was $983.00. The upper market was extremely mediocre, hovering around $3.00. Then, Han Heng and Heng Yu sold and repaired bars, retreating from $3.60 to $2.20. Da De Cheng, Tong Feng Heng, Yuan Kang Xiang, and Wan Xing accepted bars, rising again to $3.70. The general trend hovered. Da Tong delivered shillings for January at $0.375. Wang Fa Yong, Heng Yu, Da Cheng, Da Fa Yong, and others sold bars one after another, falling to $1.30. However, due to the lack of people seeking to advance with limited orders, Hong Xing, Dalian Group, Ding Tai, Shun Mao, Fu Yu, Zhen Tai, and others accepted bars, gradually rising to $4.30. Although Hong Xing bought, Luo provided some supply, and major players in the market, such as Tian Feng and Da De Cheng, all sold, dropping again to $1.80. Heng Xing, Fu Xing Yong, and Hong Xing again advanced to $3.10. Transactions were scattered, so Fu Xing Yong, Hui Xiang, and Yuan Mao Yong came to sell, dropping again to $2.00. Yuan Yi maintained prices at lower levels, and the situation remained stable, hovering. The closing price was $982.90, and the market was stable after the close. The highest price of the day was $987.20, and the lowest price was $978.20, a difference of $9.00. The result was a further drop of $2.90 compared to the noon close last Saturday.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's gold premium standard price, was $1013.20. In terms of the closing price, it was about $30.00 less, more than $1.00 more than last Saturday. January registration was $969.00, February registration was $982.00, morning make-up water was $961.00, and afternoon make-up water was $962.00. The price of fine gold, reduced by $11.00 based on the forward market, was $975.80. Spot market conditions showed a slight improvement, as the date for redeeming public bills was approaching, and the interest burden on long positions was gradually decreasing. The buying price for Tianjin goods was reduced by $7.00, and the selling price was reduced by $2.00. The Tianjin group sold 700 taels to Ying Feng Heng, reduced by $7.00, and another 150 taels at the same price. East goods were reduced by about $9.00. Although current supply is abundant, due to unfavorable prices, most customers are willing to pledge funds rather than sell, waiting for a better price to sell. Swap spreads are also low because the New Year's Day holiday will be three days, and short positions will lose several days of interest. However, long positions are taking a wait-and-see approach, leading to this situation. Li Feng posted 35 bars to Shen Kang at $13.00, and Heng Xing posted 35 bars to Shen Kang at only $12.90. There are still 6,097 bars remaining in the January contracts, with a total of 35 long positions and 17 short positions.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market. In total, Yong Li, Tong Feng Heng, Zhao Feng Chang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Fu Chang, Rui Kang, Yuan Yi, Tong Chun, Yuan Kang Xiang, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Fu Xing Yong were on the buying side. Heng Chang Yong, Shen Kang, Qian Chang Xiang, Yi Feng Yong, Tian Feng, Bing Xing, Rui Xing, Fu Tai Heng, Han Heng, Yu Qing Yong, Ding Kang, and Yu Li were on the selling side. Fu Xing Yong, Yu Xin Xiang, Heng Yu, and Heng Xing first went out and then in. Heng Xing Yuan and Zhao Feng Chang first advanced and then went out. Dalian Group and Wan Xing did a total of about 1,100 trades, netting less than 300. Shun Li did a total of more than 100 bars, advancing with a surplus. The Kwong group, Sheng Da and Heng Xing, did not trade much, with a slight surplus after netting. The total number of transactions for the day was 37,884 bars in the morning market and 10,605 bars in the afternoon market. The total number of leveraged positions for the February contract was 26,544 bars, with a total of 65 long positions and 49 short positions.</p>
<h3>Christmas Approaching, Currency Market Trend Loosens</h3>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London broad bars rose .0625 in both near and far terms, American silver rose .125, and forward silver prices also rose from five to six and a half mills. London spot gold fell 2.5 pence, the British pound rose .625 against the U.S. dollar, the British pound rose 6 pounds against the French franc, the U.S. dollar rose half a point against the British pound, and the U.S. dollar contracted .125 against the French franc. The currency market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for the British pound at 1 shilling, 4.5625 pence, and the U.S. dollar at $34.0625, compared to last Saturday, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar tighter by .0625. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar up .0625. Customs gold units fell three mills. After the opening, the situation was quite loose, but it was still supportable due to banks trading with each other. It was anticipated that HSBC would keep its British and American exchange rates unchanged. The Central Bank still had an appetite for buying, and one</p>
<p>degree was slightly tight, but supply exceeded demand for banks, and it soon stiffened again. The silver equalization tax announcement was unchanged, still taxed at 5.75%, and the British pound calculated at 1 shilling and 5.25 pence also had little impact. The process was loose and excessive. Later, HSBC took advantage of lower prices to vigorously buy shillings, and sentiment gradually stabilized. In the afternoon, the underlying potential was slightly soft. After the market opened, it was mediocre, and banks traded with each other, lacking change. Transactions were also few. Later, Datong suddenly came to supply, slightly loosening, but HSBC still had an appetite for buying, which was able to maintain the market. Chinese merchants' psychology stabilized. Before the market close, banks also watched from the sidelines. The recent process was even more mediocre, extending to the close. The near-term selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling and 4.625 pence, and the U.S. dollar was $34.25, compared to the noon close last Saturday, with the British pound loosening by .0625 and the U.S. dollar tightening by .125. Banks' appetite for buying and selling varied. HSBC vigorously bought shillings, and the Central Bank accepted U.S. dollars. Chinese merchants slightly sold shillings and U.S. dollars by more than 100,000 yuan. Today's transaction records will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 4.5625 pence. Hua Yi sold spot to Hua Bi at 5625. Hua Bi sold to Zhejiang for the same month at 625.

<h3>End of Period Approaching, Foreign Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the period, only five days away. At a time when silver funds are tight and positions are not abundant, the firmness of the market atmosphere is indeed as expected. Although there is no concern about the exhaustion of spot goods, positions are not sufficient for distribution, so the foreign interest rate is unusually firm. The morning and afternoon markets were both at four corners, the same as the previous day, and the initial head cut plus water was still as high as three corners and eight points, then dropped to two corners and five points. The after-market saw a slight rebound, changing to three corners, which shows that the market situation is not yet optimistic. In terms of interest rate transactions, the morning market had more than 2.8 million in transfers and new transactions, the afternoon market had more than 500,000 transactions, the Small General Association had more than 800,000 transactions, foreign collateral transactions had more than 1.3 million in redemptions, and more than 2 million in new transactions, with foreign merchants accounting for more than 1.4 million and Chinese merchants accounting for more than 900,000. Bank receipts and payments: foreign banks collected more than 3.4 million in bill payments, more than 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 2.5 million in year-end settlement collections, more than 4.6 million in various miscellaneous collections, more than 1.3 million in foreign exchange settlements, more than 100,000 in special exchange collections, and 800,000 in warehouse receipts.

<h3>Subsidiary Coins Fluctuate Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign coins fell to 1.5 corners in the morning market, to 841 yuan, and rose back by 2 yuan in the afternoon market, to 843 yuan, so the result was still 5 corners higher than the previous day.

<h3>End-of-Year Yarn and Cotton Market: New Yarn and Cotton Transactions Gradually Decrease</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains in a calm state, but overseas cotton markets continue to rise, and local sentiment has not been stimulated. Because the end of the year is approaching, all parties are preparing to close accounts, customer sales are sluggish, silver funds are increasingly tight, and general speculators are holding a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, the market shows a hovering pattern, but large players still absorb the amount and do not release it.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Varies Slightly Extremely. The opening of the silk premium market was based on the stability of American cotton and the continued rise of Indian cotton. People in the market had a slightly optimistic intention, with a recent increase of four or five corners, but the prices for remote months were flat. Two or three plates suddenly turned downward. It was reported that current yarn transactions were still sluggish, and the gold market had slightly fallen. By the time of closing, market conditions turned good again, and a part of the short positions were hedged. As a result, each month rose by 1.4.5 corners. The afternoon opening was still flat, with each month falling slightly by 1.2.3 corners. It was found that Da Fu sold 600 bales, Tong Ji sold 400 bales, Yu Da sold 900 bales, Da Feng sold 950 bales, Jun Chang sold 450 bales, Chang Feng sold 350 bales, Heng De sold 300 bales, and Tong Xing sold 300 bales. Geng Feng bought 1,300 bales, Rui Da bought 800 bales, Da Chang bought 450 bales, Tong He bought 350 bales, Sui Long bought 300 bales, and Shen Ji bought 450 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Premium Highest Price, Lowest Price Closing Price Increase/Decrease Number of Accounts</p>
<p>December 183.8 183.0 183.5 Down 0.10 14,950</p>

<p>Total 246,900</p>
<p>The Southern Port Purchases More Spot. Spot yarn sales are still quite good, and the southern port purchases are more energetic. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 1,085 bales throughout the day. The market is similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>The Cotton Market Started Firm and then Fell. Although Indian cotton prices are rising and new highs are being discovered every day, people's sentiment has not been affected in any way, because gold prices are flat and weak, exchange rates have not moved, and the end of the year has arrived, so new transactions are relatively scarce. The market is not excited, but the amount absorbed by the buying big players is firmly in place.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Is Calm. The opening of the cotton premium market in the morning was due to the continued rise of Indian cotton. The rising trend was very rapid. The price of white Los Angeles cotton for April and May had reached 236 rupees, which slightly increased people's sentiment. There were slightly more buyers in the market, and each month rose by one or two corners, but when shooting to the second and third plates, it was heard that the gold market broke the 980 yuan mark. At the same time, the yarn premium tended to weaken, and the situation fell. As a result, the near month was flat, and the far month rose by five points to one corner. The after-market opening turned soft, and some people expected news of a fall in Indian cotton, and the selling trend in the market was slightly stronger. Each month fell by five points. It was found that Heng Yi sold 1,200 piculs, Yu Kang sold 1,100 piculs,</p>
<p>Jin Chang sold 1,200 piculs, Shen Chang sold 2,200 piculs, Da Fu sold 6,500 piculs, Sheng Yuan sold 4,600 piculs, Yuan Xing Chang sold 1,000 piculs, Yu Da sold 1,300 piculs, Jun Chang sold 1,300 piculs, Chang Feng sold 900 piculs, and Yi Feng sold 1,400 piculs.

<h3>Yarn Exchange Will Close for Four Days for New Year Holidays</h3>

<h3>Indian Cotton Resists Short Covering and Rises Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, the futures market was very firm due to the short covering relationship in the December period. Spot transactions were smooth. Oomra new flowers collected softly. Japanese exports were successively purchased. At the same time, there were not a few transactions for immediate delivery. New cotton movements gradually increased. However, the arrival of Oomra flowers was still insufficient to meet the needs of hedging sales. The statistics for last week are attached as follows (unit: thousand bales)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Cotton Market Is Dull</h3>
<p>(Tianjin News) The atmosphere of the Xihua flower market still contains a weak intention. Western merchants still have a good appetite, but the price is also low. Fuka Foreign Company bought 370 bales, with an asking price of 36.5 yuan, and another 106 bales, with a price of 36.3 yuan. Other appetites were flat, buying 100 bales, with an asking price of 35.5 yuan. The market conditions for Western American seeds in Xihua are still light, and market prices are slightly shaky. Shen Gang Yuji bought 235 bales, with an asking price of 46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Groundless Rumors Disturb the Flour Market in Food</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, huge waves were suddenly seen in each month, because rumors suddenly arose in the market, causing people's hearts to be agitated. The market first rose sharply and then fell. Using the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was only about 2 corners, and Canada was only about 1.5 corners. In fact, there was no reason to rise sharply, but after the asking price, the market atmosphere soared, and they rushed to buy. Remote periods rose as high as five or six points due to the concentration of buyers. For example, May rose sharply by 6.8 points. The rumors of the second board have not ceased, and the recent period is still good. When shooting to March, the rumors were inaccurate, and the bulls sold one after another, and the market immediately fell by two or three points. After that, there were fewer entries and exits, and they turned to calmness. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions had become light. The speculative bulls in the morning continued to return, and the market had turned into a flat and tired trend. This kind of rise and fall is mostly due to rumors, which is not the way to operate. As a result, this month is better than 7.5 miles, January is unchanged, February is better than 1 point, and March to May are all better than 7.5 miles.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures First Rise Sharply and Then Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market first rose sharply and then fell back. Using the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago was better by about 2 corners, and Canada was better by 1 corner. When the asking price was opened, it was rumored that the foreign wheat tax was about to be implemented, so the market was in high spirits after the asking price. This month was raised to 9.8 points, January was raised to 1.5 points, February was raised to 3 points, and March was raised to 4.5 points. Compared with the closing price last weekend, the increase was about 1 corner. By the time of closing, it was rumored that it was not a fact, and it fell back by five or six points. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month was still calm, and the remote period was smaller by one or two points due to the return of the bulls. It was found that this storm was all about catching wind and shadows, which is a common occurrence in the speculative market. As a result, this month is still better than 4 points, January is better than 2 points, February is better than 4 points, March is not common, and April is better than 4 points. The spot wheat market is still calm. It is reported that Guide wheat is 4 yuan and 4 points, Yaowan Haizhou wheat is 4 yuan and 2 points, and Yangzhou wheat is 3 yuan, 9 corners, 5 points and 6 points, totaling 12,000 bales, which were handled by Fuxin Shenda.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat was flat due to short covering and purchases by brokerage firms. It is said that there was heavy rain in Argentina. There is not much need for spot corn. It is heard that some people have risen up to prevent the import of Canadian second-class wheat, but the market's feelings about this news seem to be normal.</p>

<h3>High-Grade Guest Indica Selling Price Is Tight</h3>
<p>丨Period Foreign Rice Is Not Sold Open丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions, this guest's disposal was active, but foreign rice futures were not traded at all due to the mutual holding of market prices and guarantees. 2,000 bales of Saigon and 1,000 bales of Siamese broken rice were opened for current foreign rice, and 200 bales each of Yuan rice and machine rice were distributed by the mainland and this street. There was no major difference in market conditions, because the market inventory was still sufficient, and there were many orders, so it was not easy to shout loudly for market prices for a while. Yesterday, the local guest Indica was slightly concentrated in mainland disposal, and this street also held a general meeting of the association yesterday, and the north-south river Indica rice was suspended for one day, so the disposal was also slightly active. However, there are still nearly 100,000 stored rice, and the arrival is endless, so only the rough rice is slightly tight, and high-grade goods are slightly footed, and middle and second-grade rice are still flat and soft. A total of 5,400 bales of Indica, more than 200 bales of rough rice, and more than 200 bales of machine red were traded throughout the day. The machine red was handled by Beiyang, and the rest were still distributed by the mainland this street.</p>
<h3>Imported Soybean Oil Tax Actually Collected</h3>
<p>| Market Price Increased by Sixty to Seventy Cents |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil and peanut oil markets surged with rumors that the National Government was requested to reduce or eliminate import taxes on oil from Dong Province.  However, this hope was dashed as domestic oil manufacturers and others vigorously opposed the measure.  Therefore, the full 30% tariff (30 out of 100) had to be levied.  With sources dwindling during this river closure period, market sentiment was unanimously reactive, and the market was filled with tension. As a result, soybean oil increased by fifty to sixty cents, and peanut oil by seventy cents.  Peanut oil currently has no base inventory and can only be sold as it arrives.  Soybean oil still has some inventory, but the total amount, large and small, is only over ten thousand pieces. Yesterday, statistics showed 700 pieces of peanut oil and 1,000 pieces of soybean oil opened for sale.</p>
<h3>Lack of Spot White Tung Oil in Hankou</h3>
<p>Over the past half-month, foreign firms in Hankou have been continuously purchasing white tung oil, causing the price to resist falling even during the peak season for new oil.  Despite purchases in various producing areas, the supply in Hankou is not very strong, seemingly indicating that supply cannot meet demand.  Therefore, spot oil is in great demand. Foreign firms' prices have reached 30 yuan (foreign currency) per dan. If there were a large quantity of spot oil, an additional forty to sixty cents could be added, and some foreign firms are willing to purchase it. Traders quote around 22.5 yuan for oil from Xiangyang and Tongbai, and 25.34 yuan per barrel, including tax. However, only a few hundred dan have arrived. Large shipments are extremely rare because foreign firms are intercepting the oil at the production areas. Consequently, arrivals in Hankou are scarce. There is a relatively large amount of production along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway in Jinhua and Lanxi, but the quality is insufficient and can only be used for domestic sales. Foreign firms dislike the insufficient quality, so even with a strong market, their goods are slow to move. Although local firms in this port have managed to purchase some, it is not a large amount. Foreign firms are currently purchasing oil everywhere, so the future market, even if..., is limited.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Continues to Open with 500 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained strong due to the continued shortage of spot coarse granulated white sugar. The guild's clearing price for ordinary coarse granulated white sugar was 18.7 yuan, up another 3 cents from the previous day. Delivery at the dock was 18.77 yuan. Transshipment goods were not cleared due to customs closure today. Ordinary No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was 14 yuan. Taikoo sugar and local factory white sugar remained unchanged. Yesterday, Chaoqing sugar continued to open with a volume of 500 bags, priced at 11.87 to 11.56 yuan, and the next grade at 11.23 yuan. The second batch of new Diaoging sugar, totaling 796 bags, arrived yesterday via the Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel. Coinciding with a decline in Chaoqing prices, losses are expected. According to telegrams from Guangdong, local prices remain firm, with Zhuqing at 10.8 yuan and Pianqing at 10.45 yuan. Including all external expenses, it is currently difficult to break even. Therefore, although the arrival of Chaoqing sugar is large, the price has already fallen by sixty to seventy cents, and the future market may be difficult to lower further.</p>
<h3>Noodle Thread: Longkou Noodles Follow Hankou's Price Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, in the Longkou noodle thread market, the weather in the production area has become increasingly cold, making it difficult to continue production. Therefore, the market is tightening. According to yesterday's telegrams, the price was initially 28.5 yuan, then 28.7 yuan, and finally rose to 29 yuan, an increase of seventy to eighty cents per package compared to the previous settlement. Consequently, the Shanghai market is following closely. Northern-standard is quoted at 23 yuan, with sales above 22.5 yuan, and Southern-standard also requires more than 21 yuan. Currently, sales are in season, and the future market may tighten further.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The First Silk Auction at the San Francisco Exchange</h3>
<p>| Spot Goods to be Auctioned Next Year |</p>
<p>As previously reported in this newspaper, Chinese silk can also be delivered and traded alongside raw silk at the San Francisco Exchange's auction. We now have official confirmation that the exchange, which was scheduled to open on the 17th of this month, has commenced operations as scheduled. Forward contracts are being traded first, with spot goods and current month contracts scheduled to begin on January 24th of next year. Shanghai has not yet officially disseminated market prices from the exchange. Today, we obtained a telegram from private sources, which shows the auction prices on the opening day, as follows. Although the prices are outdated, they are worth commemorating. (Price per pound in US dollars)</p>
<p>Opening Price Closing Price</p>

<h3>Securities: Both Long and Short Positions Adjusting, Public Bonds Showing Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, this month's futures contracts were nearing their final one or two days. There were still some positions in the market that had not been squared, so position adjustments were particularly active. Retail arbitrage trading also remained very enthusiastic. The trend is temporarily diverging from the environment. Each side is taking its own course based on its own supply and demand dynamics for long and short positions. Therefore, the high price of foreign exchange at four cents is no longer a matter of concern. The Sino-American loan, which is in the works, is not as straightforward as previously reported. It is possibly true that HSBC plans to ship back 20 million taels of silver from Hong Kong. However, whether it will be circulated in the market is still a question. The government is making every effort to maintain silver supply and take into consideration all aspects. In the near future, there will certainly be proper measures to stabilize the market. The public bond market is relatively stable, and the trend is gradually improving. The account balances for this month are only about 30 million, while forward contracts have accumulated to 50 million. Therefore, there should not be much turbulence under the current circumstances. Today is the last day of this month's contracts, and there may still be some infighting. Yesterday, the market opened with a unanimous increase. Bonds No. 16, 20, and 21, etc., were all being bought, and arbitrage trading was also surging. There were few sellers in the market, with increases of about ten to twenty cents to half a yuan. Market prices gradually returned to a moderate state. In the second session, bonds No. 43, 48, and 53, etc., were again being sold, mostly by bulls from last week. Market prices suddenly and uniformly declined, becoming more intense as the day progressed. The 22nd Customs bond fell sharply by eight and a half cents, mostly due to bulls adjusting positions downward. Most of the losses exceeded the gains from the morning session. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized. However, the opening prices listed earlier fell following the morning trend, and bulls again adjusted positions. The settlement for this month suddenly fell by six cents. Since the short-term gold bond, bonds No. 16 and 20 again had short positions being adjusted, and market prices slowly rebounded by three to four cents, gradually narrowing the gap between highs and lows. Closing reports indicated that 20 million taels of silver were being returned to Shanghai. Bond No. 4 was bought, and the settlement rebounded by four and a half cents. The remaining bonds also improved by two to three cents. As a result, market prices varied due to the different decisions made by bulls and bears when adjusting positions, with most gains outweighing losses by about thirty to fifty cents. The total trading volume was about 20 million or more. The resulting gains and losses are listed in the comparative table below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Going to court is originally the most unfortunate thing, and also the most painful thing. Regardless of criminal or civil cases, once involved in litigation, the outcome is difficult to predict. Even if one is fortunate enough to win the case, and the truth is revealed, the troublesome procedures and the burden of litigation costs are already considerable. Moreover, there are countless cases of prolonged litigation that lead to the parties' bankruptcy and ruin. Isn't litigation the most unfortunate and painful thing?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The government office opens wide, but those with reason and no money should not enter." Therefore, the darkness of judicial offices has been like this since ancient times. Han Shi Zhi said, "The law is for the common good of the world." Zhou Bo said, "I once commanded a million troops, how would I know the value of prison officials?" Therefore, according to the former saying, the law is a public instrument of the world, and judges should not arbitrarily manipulate it to distort the truth. According to the latter saying, under duress, nothing cannot be obtained; life and death are determined by the heart, and likes and dislikes are expressed through the mouth. What a terrifying authority!</p>
<p>Although it is said that judges originally have laws as their basis and facts as their standard, and cannot arbitrarily manipulate or reverse right and wrong, it should be known that the complexities of the matter and the application of the clauses all have the possibility of high and low considerations and arbitrary decisions. Therefore, in official documents of the past, there were two brilliant phrases: "The law is unforgiving, but the circumstances are excusable." With a single reversal, the severity of the crime can vary greatly. There were even cases of "killing with a knife" being changed to "swinging a knife to kill," with the difference between light and heavy being just a half-stroke. Although the laws have now been revised, there is still an absolute possibility of distorting the facts and making arbitrary decisions.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a judge cannot be upright and impartial and acts according to personal feelings, the suffering of the parties is truly "like a mute eating coptis, unable to express their bitterness." It goes without saying that if a judge is corrupt and perverts the law, distorting the truth, the judgment of the case will inevitably deviate from the principle of fairness. Even if they are ignorant of social conditions, do not understand the complexities of the case, and make arbitrary decisions, a wrongful case can be created. Or, if they pride themselves on their insight, conjecture the facts of the case, reverse right and wrong, and make arbitrary judgments, they can also create a wrongful case. In short, judicial officials should bear the heavy responsibility for unfair judgments caused by bribery. Even if a wrongful imprisonment is caused by carelessness or negligence, the judicial official cannot escape responsibility.</p>
<p>Although the judiciary is said to be independent, the authority of judges is not absolutely unlimited. They should bear considerable responsibility to the state and society. Judicial officials often misunderstand the meaning of judicial independence and the right to appeal, thinking that independence means they can freely make judgments. Even if an appeal results in vindication, the loss of reputation and material possessions is incalculable. If the judge bears no responsibility in such a situation, it is no wonder they act arbitrarily, with no regard for the consequences.</p>
<p>The doctrine of karma may not be enough to save the hearts of evildoers, but if a judge does not understand the suffering of the parties, is only interested in personal gain, and makes arbitrary judgments, causing one party to suffer injustice and be unable to vindicate the truth, those who accumulate resentment will surely bear the consequences.</p>
<h3>Meeting the Ship</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Ying sent a telegram saying she had started her return to Shanghai from the southern country.</p>
<p>Calculating the dates, the ship should arrive today, but I dared not be certain, fearing a fruitless wait at the dock. So I went to the hotel to ask and was told that the ship would likely dock around five or six in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The early winter sun had already withdrawn its weak and feeble light, fleeing to the western horizon to rest. Although the cold wind was as sharp as a knife, making the ears and noses of those hurrying along blush like pigs' snouts, the joy of Ying's return after a year apart, along with our lovely, pure, and innocent child, made me feel not at all cold. I hurried to the Bund dock.</p>
<p>The dock was as noisy as ever. The porters' grunts of exertion were loud, fully expressing their strength. The melodious calls of the snack vendors and the laughter of the hotel greeters in their uniforms were so clamorous they could overwhelm one's senses.</p>
<p>The massive "Xinjiang" ship, like a small mountain, rested serenely beside the floating dock, its huge smokestack gently puffing out plumes of black smoke, allowing the porters to load goods into its belly.</p>
<p>Ah, this was the "Xinjiang" that took my Ying and our innocent, lively child away last year.</p>
<p>Then, the traces of past sorrow resurfaced in my heart.</p>
<p>It was during a hot summer day last year. I had lost my job and was living a vagrant life at sea. Economic hardship often caused our small family of three to worry about food and drink. I began to feel extremely miserable. Although the child often wore an innocent smile and affectionately coaxed me to laugh and hug him, I always felt that the child was too much of a burden. I cursed him for being born so early. But the child was innocent. He did not understand the inner turmoil of his father, who was weighed down by the burden of life. He always flashed a pair of dark, bright little eyes, revealing a natural smile. Sometimes, the child's incessant crying because he couldn't bear the hunger interrupted my train of thought and prevented me from writing, arousing my anger. I would angrily spank the child's buttocks. As a result, Ying became dissatisfied and argued with me, lying stiffly on the bed and sobbing.</p>
<p>Finally, one evening, the dark sky was studded with dense stars, and fireflies lit torches to enter the children's dreams, flying from one dark corner to another, luring the children to chase and shout. On that summer evening, Ying, holding the child, sat with me under the eaves, enjoying the cool air. After a moment of contemplation, Ying said to me very seriously:</p>
<p>"Ren, our life is so precarious now that we can hardly survive, especially for the child. I think I should take the child back to the South. This way, I can lessen your burden and allow you to work in peace." Ying's voice trembled, and I guessed she must be crying in the dark.</p>
<p>"I think it's better not to go. This kind of life won't last long anyway. Ying, is it?" The thought of Ying leaving made my heart ache a little. However, the instability of life over the years made me feel too sorry for Ying and the child.</p>
<p>"No, it's better for me to go. Maybe I can find some work to do in the South," Ying replied without hesitation and with certainty.</p>
<p>So Ying and our innocent child were taken away by this "Xinjiang" ship.</p>
<p>The darkness of night had already fallen upon the earth, blurring all the distant scenes across the river. At this time, the pier's lights had already shone with brightness. My heart began to feel a little anxious. I turned to the partners who had come to meet their people and asked:</p>
<p>"Why hasn't the ship come alongside the dock yet?"</p>
<p>"It might have to stop outside Wusongkou tonight," the partners answered indifferently, rubbing the backs of their hands, scattering like birds returning to the forest.</p>
<p>I felt utterly disappointed. At the same time, the icy cold wind assaulted my thin autumn coat, making me shiver uncontrollably. Finally, I quickly left the noisy dock and returned home with a disappointed heart.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Life</h3>
<p>— Bu Bai</p>
<p>Old Friend:</p>
<p>We all saw the film "The Ordeal of the Peach and Plum"! After you left the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre, didn't you say this: "I'm actually afraid of life! I'm shrinking!" I didn't say anything to you at the time. We walked silently, walked on.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>I was thinking; that male protagonist in the film, in order to survive, was demoted from a shipping company employee to a worker in a construction factory, and then fell further, becoming a thief, and was eventually shot dead for resisting arrest! Ah! Indeed, how could this not make you afraid of life? Shrink?</p>
<p>Thinking, walking silently, we eventually separated at the crossroads. Turning my head back, I saw the backs of you and your lover. I shook my head and sighed at your backs.</p>
<p>Alas! Old friend! You are afraid of life. You are like a vibrant flower, withered by the cold winter wind! How pitiful!</p>
<p>Today, I suddenly received your letter, inviting me to talk. During our conversation, I realized how distressed you are! You don't want to return to your corrupt family, but you also don't have the courage to rent a small room and live the "wild rose" life you admire. Because you say; it's quite inconvenient, such as boiling water and all sorts of chores.</p>
<p>But old friend! You sighed again after all; "I'm afraid of life! I'm shrinking!"</p>
<p>Old friend! Here, you have too much of a misunderstanding of the meaning of "life"! You think that anything that requires "struggle" is life, but old friend! Your understanding of life is wrong. In this very mistake, you lack the heart of "advancement"!</p>
<p>Life, yes life, from the moment an infant comes into the world from its mother's womb, it has to live. Life is always in need of "struggle." Without the strength to "struggle" against the environment, then there will be no life. Without life, wouldn't that person become someone in a grave? Therefore, every person always has "life," which is to say, they have at least "more or less" strength to struggle. Being afraid of life, in the end, will inevitably be killed by the environment!</p>
<p>Old friend! This way, you are "living," which is to say you are struggling for life! But old friend! Forgive me for being so blunt in criticizing you, you lack the courage to "move forward" too much, and you also think that only "struggling" is life, therefore, you are afraid of a life of struggle. Little do you know that you are living now, aren't you also struggling at every moment?</p>
<p>I've said too much! Do you find it annoying? In one sentence, you lack the courage to "move forward" too much.</p>
<p>Finally, you must understand that a young person of a new era must have the spirit of "self-criticism." We must constantly examine ourselves, we must constantly urge ourselves! Why? Because we are deeply afraid that we will "turn backwards!"</p>
<p>Life is struggle! Only struggle is life! I wish you to move forward!</p>
<h3>Musings by the Stove</h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>The weather is getting cold, which is a threat to us poor folks. The north wind is blowing all day outside, and the sun is hiding in the clouds, not even bothering to show its face. In times like these, it's perfect for the rich to indulge their pleasures. Changes in the weather have no effect on them. On the contrary, the different seasons give them a more flavorful and pleasant mood. In such freezing winters, if it happens to be snowing outside the window, the scenery becomes even more beautiful. They are wrapped up in warm, luxurious, radiator-heated rooms, only needing to wear a thin shirt to appreciate the silver world of snow outside. Perhaps they even turn on the radio, playing a few cheesy songs, indulging in a particularly poetic winter day. If they happen to be in the mood, they can easily jump into their car and drive out to the suburbs to watch the snow.</p>
<p>We poor folks don't have such blessings. Right now, we can only close our eyes and admire them in our fantasies. Sometimes, even the right to fantasize feels very precious. Because as soon as we open our eyes, the troubles of reality immediately swarm our minds. In front of us is a small iron stove - which we can pretend is a radiator. We put in a few pieces of black coal to get some warmth. Besides that, there's a bag of peanuts and a bowl of yellow wine. We slowly sip the wine, nibble on the peanuts, and watch the flames rise in the stove. Thinking about it, being able to spend winter days like this can also be considered comfortable. People should know when to stop and be content. Why be extravagant? A few cups of yellow wine and a pile of peanuts, the light flavor also has a not-so-light meaning. If we feel too lonely staying in the room alone, then we can call a few more people over. If there are more people, and they all like to drink, then we add some wine and some snacks. Everyone gathers around the stove, the red light of the fire makes everyone's face feel warm. The faces that were already a little red from the wine become even redder. Then, everyone talks and laughs, all with a bit of alcohol in them, and are more excited than usual. Some people, without any reservation, tell their sweet love stories that they usually wouldn't want to talk about, and the listeners also find it quite interesting. But there's no need to turn on the radio and play a few popular songs. So those who are good at singing start singing themselves, which is more intimate and moving. In this kind of situation, with wine, songs, and laughter, time passes by very pleasantly.</p>
<p>But suddenly, there's a moment of silence. After the silence, talking about this and that, somehow we start talking about ourselves. Once we start talking about ourselves, the energy that everyone just had disappears in an instant. The air immediately becomes very stuffy, as if it's about to solidify. Everyone is silent, silently lowering their heads. No one wants to say a word, and everyone is trapped in their own worries and falls into the web of煩惱. Besides a faint sigh, there's only the crackling sound from the stove. Why did everyone suddenly become so dejected? This is something that no one wants to say! Just let each person know it in their heart. We also have the same feeling. What we sigh for is that even these ordinary days are not easy to get through, and we are all gritting our teeth and holding on.</p>
<p>What else is there to be happy about? Aren't we just borrowing temporary intoxication to temporarily numb the pain? But the pain often doesn't disappear because of this. Instead, the pain becomes even more unbearable.</p>
<p>Until the middle of the night, everyone is a bit tired. We see them out the door. We return to our small, freezing room. The fire in the stove has gradually weakened, and there are only a few pieces of coal left. It probably won't last through half the night. And at this time, the snow is falling harder. We worry that on their way back, they might catch a cold since the alcohol they drank earlier hasn't completely worn off. What if they get sick tomorrow? But when we touch our pockets, we only have a few coppers left. There's no way to add more coal, and even next year's livelihood is uncertain. The alcohol wears off early, and the warmth on our body also fades. Thinking about it, our feelings and limbs also become cold. We blindly crawl into bed, and let everything be said about it tomorrow!</p>
<p>— Yuyan</p>
<h3>A Mother's Tears</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Flow, flow, flow, endlessly flowing; a mother's tears are inexhaustible!</p>
<p>What I fear most is seeing my mother's tears, because every time I see them, I feel uneasy and ashamed; yet she often sheds them in front of me. But why does she weep? And how can I stop her from weeping? Alas, it truly makes me feel infinitely ashamed!</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because I'm not progressing enough! Having raised such a big son, she still has to toil and run around, unable to enjoy a peaceful day. Logically speaking: she's so old, her son is so grown up! The daughter-in-law is already married into the family, and the grandson is already held in her arms. To most people, this would seem like a wonderful blessing; but, but she has no blessing, only grievances! I am truly laden with sin!</p>
<p>My mother has become even older and thinner in recent years, and her cough has become worse than in previous years. Yet she still has such a competitive spirit, always unwilling to let young people take a step forward. Seeing her son – me – in dire straits, with expenses growing daily while income dwindles, she worries about me greatly. Therefore, she always tries heaven and earth to help me produce something. Moreover, I have suffered a massive blow in recent years after the rural bankruptcy!</p>
<p>However, the nature of our mother-son relationship differs from the "benevolent mother and filial son" situation of others. As long as we are together, we quarrel, eventually escalating from arguments to disputes. She likes to nag, while I am inherently irritable. Both of us are equally stubborn. After each quarrel, she refuses to eat, lies in bed, and weeps. At that time, I also hide in bed and weep: the internal contradictions torment me. I regret that I shouldn't have clashed with her. But when idle words reach my lips, they can't be taken back, and there's no time to weigh their importance. After a day, we comfort each other again, but after a while, we clash again at the slightest disagreement. I am truly an unfilial son! She helps me so much, why can't I even concede a single word? I curse myself, why can't I understand her?</p>
<p>I remember the first time I returned home after graduating. At that time, I was as happy as if I had passed the imperial examination and returned home in glory by imperial decree. A few days before setting off, I wrote a letter home to tell my mother when I would return. From then on, I eagerly hoped for the day of my return to come quickly. My heart truly felt like "my heart returns like an arrow!" But the days seemed to pass especially slowly, as if deliberately opposing me. At night, I don't know how many beautiful dreams I had of returning home, dreaming of how happy my mother would be to see me return, laughing with happiness, tears streaming down her face.</p>
<p>Back home, I quarreled with her again the next day; so after three days, I returned to the shop. This time I cried for three whole days, and cried so sadly that I became weak. When I got to the shop, I cried heartily again. I have never been willing to put up with grievances in my life.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my mother came to Shanghai, and I quarreled with her again. When we quarreled, she shed tears. I couldn't bear to see her tears, but I couldn't stop her from shedding them. Later, I came back and secretly shed tears all night myself. The next night, I wanted to send her to the train, but she had already left quietly. Disappointed and grieving, I wandered around the station for three hours, returning home late at one in the morning. Alas! I am too heartless. I should kneel before the cross to be punished!</p>
<p>Amateur Letter Box</p>
<h3>Explanation Regarding Volcanoes</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I now have a question about natural science that I would like to ask you to answer.</p>
<p>I often see news reports about volcanic eruptions in various countries, which I find very strange. What causes volcanoes? Why do they erupt? I have asked many people, but their answers are very vague and unclear, which makes me even more suspicious. Therefore, I am writing this letter to you, hoping that you can fulfill my expectations! Best wishes,</p>
<p>Wang Yue, respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Although we do not have much research on natural science issues, if readers have such questions, we will do our best to answer them based on what we know, or refer them to experts for answers. We always want readers to gain a relatively clear understanding.</p>
<p>How do volcanoes erupt? This is indeed a very interesting question. To those who do not know,</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>it must seem very strange and mysterious, but after careful research by scientists, we can know that this is just a natural phenomenon in the universe.</p>
<p>To talk about the causes of volcanoes, we must delve into the internal structure of the earth. We have not yet gained a clear understanding of the internal structure of the earth, because we currently lack excellent and complete instruments to see into the Earth's core. However, according to scientists' speculation, the causes of volcanic formation and eruption are likely due to water vapor and heat. Some say that since the Earth was formed from extremely hot gases, the interior must still retain a very high temperature. Others believe that heat is generated by friction when the Earth's layers move. Since the discovery of radioactive materials, some have also believed that the Earth is formed by the disintegration of atoms of various elements. Volcanoes are the same. Although it is not yet possible to determine who is right and who is wrong, based on general common sense, we can believe that the interior of the Earth does indeed contain a very high temperature. At the same time, magma cannot solidify and is constantly compressed by the Earth's crust. Naturally, it has a large swelling force. Once the Earth's crust is eroded and loosened by the outside world, it is bound to be burst open, and the magma is bound to seize the opportunity to rush out. This is the so-called common explanation of volcanoes.</p>
<p>Volcanic eruptions can be violent or gentle. Generally, volcanoes that erupt frequently are mostly gentle. Volcanoes that have been dormant for a long time and then erupt are mostly violent; and the longer the dormancy period, the more violent the eruption. When violent volcanoes erupt, they stir up huge waves in the sea, overturning ships; the coast also shakes extremely violently, and many houses are destroyed. The casualties of humans and animals are even more horrifying. The situation at that time is truly terrifying. However, there are very few volcanoes within China. Most are in the Americas and Japan in the Pacific basin.</p>

<h3>Outline of the Traffic Ministry Building Construction</h3>
<p>— A-Shou</p>
<p>The Traffic Ministry Building, which took four and a half years to construct, has recently opened for public viewing this month. Its majestic grandeur and sophisticated, practical facilities surpass those of any other building in the capital. While the Chinese White House (National Government), the Railway Ministry, the Foreign Ministry, and other government agencies are indeed refined and grand, they pale in comparison to the Traffic Ministry, resembling small sorcerers before a great one.</p>
<p>Located north of the capital city, at the southern end of Sajiawan, and facing the Railway Ministry to the east and west, the square-shaped building occupies fifty acres of land and cost approximately 2,000,000 yuan to construct. Construction began in 1931 under the former Minister of Transportation, Wang Boqun, who signed a contract with Xin Fengji and commissioned a Russian architect to design the blueprints. However, the September 18th Incident of the same year led to the suspension of construction. Later, under the leadership of the current Minister of Transportation, Zhu Jiaju, the project was diligently promoted and continued, resulting in the magnificent new building that graces the capital and stands superior to all other structures in the new capital.</p>
<p>The exterior of the building exudes splendor, solemnity, and tranquility. The design incorporates both Chinese and Western palace styles. The main entrance faces Zhongshan Road and features two gates, north and south, approximately thirty yards apart, connected by a short wall. The perimeter of the building is surrounded by a ring wall and a protective moat, with flowing clear water, adding a unique charm. Stone bridges span the river for passage and provide a grand view. Inside the main gate, the right side houses the information room, while the left side serves as the guard room. Each section is adorned with exotic flowers, beautiful grasses, verdant trees, and elegant plants.</p>
<p>The new building consists of four interconnected floors. The central section comprises two four-story buildings, topped with a small pavilion and a rooftop garden. Flanking the main building are two three-story structures, reportedly housing the General Post Office and the Directorate General of Telecommunications. The building has a total of four entrances. The odd-numbered entrances (first and third) are palace-style pavilion gates, while the even-numbered entrances are city gate-style arched doorways. Behind the gates are gardens connecting to the rear building. The interior comprises over three hundred rooms, including offices for various departments and bureaus, facing each other and standing opposite one another. Windows all face outward. The walls are constructed of cement, smooth and clean. The office floors are made of pine wood, coated with bronze-colored paint, creating a bright and inviting atmosphere. The walls are painted white, while the walls of the minister and vice-minister's offices are decorated with green wallpaper with gold trim. The allocation of rooms on each of the four floors is largely complete. The ground floor houses the general affairs department, technical offices, and a dining hall. The second floor contains the offices of the minister and vice-ministers, as well as the secretariat, the counselors' office, the navigation department, and the auditorium. The third floor houses the offices of the postal department, the telecommunications department, and the employee affairs committee. The fourth floor houses the accountant-general's office and the library. The second floor is considered the essence of the entire building. The auditorium is vast and spacious, supported by six large vermilion wooden pillars. The ceiling is intricately carved and features eye-catching green and gold color combinations, complementing each other. The floor is made of high-quality Western wooden strips, pieced together to form various patterns, adding splendor and beauty, enhancing the reputation of Chinese architecture. The broad and practical stage can be used for dancing and banquets, as well as for theatrical performances. The hall has around a thousand leather seats and can accommodate at least seven hundred people.</p>
<p>The minister's office is located on the second floor of the rear building, occupying three large rooms and one small room. The rooms are divided into an office, a dressing room, a large reception room, and a small reception room. The office is exquisitely decorated and furnished, with everything needed. The desk has three telephones, a rarity compared to other ministries. The vice-minister's office is located on the second floor of the front building, with similar facilities to the minister's office, except for the absence of a reception room.</p>
<p>Other equipment in the various rooms, such as desks and chairs, are all Western-style. Electricity, heating, electric bells, telephones, and wireless radios are all the latest 20th-century installations. The electric lights, telephones, and wireless radios are supplied by Siemens, while the electric bells are installed in the walls. The telephones can be used in three ways: (1) automatic communication with ministry personnel for official business; (2) external communication; and (3) prioritizing urgent matters without interrupting ongoing conversations. This type of facility is unprecedented in government agencies in the capital. Furthermore, the new building offers the convenience of conducting ministry meetings and discussions via telephone, eliminating the need to gather everyone in one room, thereby increasing work efficiency. It is said that the Ministry of Transportation's relocation is well underway, and the General Post Office will move its operations from Shanghai to Beijing in January of next year. It is also rumored that the construction funds for the new Ministry of Transportation building were drawn from the surplus of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Capital Construction (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>In the past, Nanjing's construction was very depressed due to population reasons. The development of Nanjing's construction after the capital was established is self-evident. According to the statistics of the Public Works Bureau, the construction in the past four years has been progressing gradually. The construction area, number of projects, and cost from 1931 to June of this year are written below. In 1931, the land area occupied by residential construction was 46,740 square meters, the construction cost was 7,149,495 yuan, and there were 1,034 projects. In 1932, the construction occupied 90,855 square meters, the cost was 3,911,352 yuan, and there were 665 projects. In 1933, the construction area was 23,775 square meters, the cost was 3,084,381 yuan, and there were 751 projects. In the first six months of this year, the construction area was 11,332 square meters and the cost was 4,206,034 yuan, and there were 417 projects. In the past three years and six months, the total construction area was 172,702 square meters, the cost was 18,351,262 yuan, and there were 2,867 projects. As for those renovated and rebuilt buildings, they are not included. From the above amount, the general situation of the current construction can be imagined.</p>
<p>Before Nanjing became the capital, most of the buildings were concentrated in the east and west of the city. In the north of the city, except for the official residences, consulates, and the self-built foreign-style buildings of one or two wealthy people, most of them were low houses and thatched huts where poor people lived. There was no construction to speak of, so it was not easy to find neat residences. After the capital was established, due to the daily increase of the population, the small number of residences in Nanjing could not accommodate this huge population. A few years ago, we could still see barren land and ponds. Now, many of them have become construction sites for high-rise buildings. For example, Huiyuanli, Jintangli, Liangyouli, Wenhuali, Zhonglinfang, Zijinfang, Zhongyifang, Wutaishan Village, Meiyuan New Village, Taoyuan New Village...etc. are all new buildings on the former barren land and ponds. Moreover, in each of these villages and neighborhoods, there are dozens or even hundreds of houses. Other small-scale construction projects are too numerous to mention. As for private residential construction, the number is also quite large! With Nanjing's land area of 477.845 square kilometers, compared with the current population and construction, it is obviously not very crowded. However, Nanjing already has zoning regulations, which are divided into six districts: (1) Central Political District, (2) Cultural District, (3) Urban Garden District, (4) Residential District, (5) Commercial District, (6) Industrial District. Although the boundaries have not yet been precisely determined, they will certainly be determined in the future. Because if the city is not divided into districts, the construction will inevitably be mixed, which will be a great hindrance to the lives of citizens and the entire city. Therefore, the Nanjing city government has already paid attention to dividing the six districts, and the residential area is located near Gulou in the north of the city and in the northwest of the city, starting from Xihuamen and along Zhongshan Road. As mentioned above, the north of the city was a very desolate place with no construction to speak of before the capital was established. Now, because it is designated as a residential area, construction has increased a lot in the past few years to accommodate the influx of people. The future expansion is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Because the population of Nanjing is increasing day by day, the soaring prices of real estate are an inevitable trend. In the past, the land that was worthless is now very expensive. According to the land prices approved by the Finance Bureau recently, the general situation of land prices in Nanjing can also be seen. Guo Jiaqiao outside Hepingmen sells for 1,690 yuan per square, the land behind Zhonghua Road is valued at 4,000 yuan per mu, Zhongshan Road is valued at more than 10,000 yuan per mu, Chibi Road in the residential area is valued at 5,000 yuan per mu, Zhongzheng Road is valued at 120 yuan per square, Youshi Avenue is valued at 25,600,000 yuan per mu, Jianye Road is valued at 3,000 yuan per mu, Guofu West Street is valued at 56,000 yuan per mu, Huiyuanli in the north of the city is valued at 100 yuan per square, and Zhongshan Road is valued at 12,300 yuan per mu. In short, land prices are rising sharply year by year, just like the construction industry. Since land prices are so high, housing has become a serious problem for residents. Because of the increase in urban population and the soaring land prices, the rent is rising day by day, which is a chain reaction. In the past, the rent in Nanjing was very cheap. If you spent dozens of yuan a month, you could rent a decent residence. Now, it has exceeded the rent price of four or five times years ago, and the deposit is large, more than three or five times the rent, or even seven or eight times. This phenomenon further proves that the supply of housing is insufficient. As a result, people pay a high price, but the accommodation they get is just like a birdcage. For example, in the newly built villages and neighborhoods in the north of the city, the rooms are not very spacious or comfortable. Living alone in a house is already very cramped, and the rent is as high as 40 to 100 yuan per month. Therefore, the general residents spend 20% to 30% of their monthly income on rent, and the houses they live in are still closed. The people living around them are very close together. As a result of this kind of living, not only does it have a significant impact on the national economy, but it also leads to physical weakness and mental fatigue. The various intangible losses are very significant. Therefore, the municipal authorities, in view of the daily increase in population, should consider the necessity of low-income housing to solve the housing problem in Nanjing. Finally, the future construction of Nanjing, along with the consolidation of politics, is just beginning to flourish! (The End)</p>

<p>Scraping Ruler 丨丨 It is the work after the bricks are laid. That is, plastering. Usually, straw mud (Strawmud) is used as the base. (Straw mud is a mixture of straw, black sand, and lime slurry.) Initially, a cloud strip is used to even out the thickness of the wall surface, then straw mud is applied, and then a scraping ruler is used to smooth it out.</p>
<p>Horse 丨丨 It is a type of template derived from a detail (an architect enlarges a part of the drawing, called a detail) used when plastering ceiling moldings. It is made of five or six tenths of an inch thick wood and is called a horse.</p>
<p>White Ground 丨丨 (Shank) It is the flat surface in the middle of the dentil and the fluted sides of a Doric architrave. It is called the white ground.</p>
<p>Dentil 丨丨 It is a type of decoration in plastering work. It is usually used on elaborate ceiling cornices near the wall. They are small pieces with white ground in between that are glued on. There is no fixed pattern for its design.</p>
<p>Layer Stick 丨丨 (LayerstickorCourespole) It is a planed wooden rod (approximately four inches square). There are black marking lines drawn on the surface. These lines indicate the distance between the bricks and the mortar joints. It is generally used on fair-faced brick walls to prevent the long seams from being skewed or curved.</p>
<p>Long Seam 丨丨 (Horizotedjoist) Each mortar joint (Pointing) that runs horizontally as bricks are laid is called a long seam. Conversely, a vertically discontinuous joint is called a head seam (Verticaljoist).</p>
<p>Header Brick 丨丨 The width of a brick (Headbrick) is called the header. Its length is called a stretcher brick (Strectcbetbrick). Plasterers have a method called header-stretcher bond, which is a method of laying bricks by alternating headers and stretchers.</p>
<p>New Number Three 丨丨 What is called New Number Three? It is a nickname for a type of brick. Its dimensions are nine and one-tenth inches long, four and a half inches wide, and one and six-tenths of an inch thick. There is also a type called Number Three Fang, which measures eight and seven-tenths inches, four and two-tenths inches, and one and six-tenths inches. Both blue and red are available. However, there are several nicknames for bricks. The most common production areas are Xiadian Temple, Hongjiatan, and Luxu. However, currently, Taishan, Zhensu, Dazhong, and other brands are widely used in various construction sites. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Talking About the Design of Wine Dance Halls (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Pillow Wood</p>
<p>Regarding the interior 丨丨, this refers to the structure inside the walls and gates of the wine dance hall. The following should be noted: (1) Dance floor: Dancing is a related business in wine dance halls, so a dance floor must be designed. (2) For the convenience of female customers, a dressing and washing room should be set up. (3) The allocation of indoor space must be carefully considered. (4) The staircase leading to the large kitchen should be long and wide, and well-lit to facilitate movement. (5) The upper floors can be decorated with calligraphy, paintings, flowers, curtains, etc. (6) It is okay to place thicker columns in the dining room; the main kitchen can sometimes be divided into countless small dining rooms, but the partitions of such dining rooms should have soundproof double walls to facilitate the privacy of customers. (7) Sometimes, to accommodate group or family customers, they can be designed in the style of apartments, with living rooms, private washrooms, dining rooms, etc. for service. (8) If possible, the design of a rooftop garden is also necessary. (9) Regarding the stove room and the cooking room, they must be properly located to save time. For example, the oven and wine cellar can be set up on the lower floor of the main kitchen.</p>
<p>Regarding the exterior 丨丨, this is only the appearance of the main entrance and wall decorations. The solemnity, timeliness, attractiveness, novelty, and eye-catching colors should all be taken into consideration. The windows facing the street should also be designed to be mysterious and attractive, and new decorations should be prepared frequently to promote awareness. The entrance and exit doors must be flexible to open and close, and their width should be at least wide enough for four or five people to walk in and out side by side. Rotating glass push doors can also be used.</p>
<p>(B) Construction In the design of wine dance halls, the construction aspects can be divided into: air, elevators, light, telephone, wireless radio, etc.: (1) The air in the house is very important, and it must be designed to circulate to prevent smog. (2) The design of the elevator must be new, safe, and fast. In addition to transporting people, it can also transport food directly up and down. (3) Light in wine dance halls is related to dancing and music, so it must be designed appropriately. (4) The telephone in the wine dance hall is used by many people and should be disinfected frequently, and the location of the telephone room should be in a central area for easy access. (5) Wireless radios in wine dance halls can be included as an auxiliary entertainment.</p>
<p>(C) Exterior View When designing a wine dance hall, it is best to have a garden outside, so that customers who are drunk can feel refreshed after going out, and it is especially needed in the hot summer.</p>
<p>(D) Decoration and Furniture In the construction of furniture and decorations in wine dance halls, lampshades can be added to the lamps, mirrors can be inlaid on the walls, and small lamps can be specially prepared for dancing. Copper handrails, aluminum chair backs, and silver countertops can add a lot of color and excitement.</p>
<p>The above are the important points for the design of wine dance halls. In addition, the height of the tables that should be placed in the wine dance hall should be 30 inches. The table top for two people should be 30 x 30 inches, and the table top for four people should be 36 x 36 inches. The allocation of tables in each room should be 50% for two-person tables, 30% for four-person tables, and the remaining 20% for round tables. This is also introduced here for your attention.

<h3>"Suffering the Most Bitter Hardships Leads to Being the Best" (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Mitong</p>
<p>Today's stars are yesterday's extras</p>
<p>Don't be discouraged, hard work is the path to success</p>
<p>There must be tens of millions of women around the world who admire and envy Joan Crawford. They always like to say, "If only I had her opportunity, I could be rich for a while." They imitate Joan's hairstyle, they imitate Joan's clothes, they imitate Joan's lipstick, and they imitate her every move. They don't know that every woman has a better chance of success than Joan, because Joan's rise to stardom is not based on her appearance. Her rise step by step comes from work, learning, hard work, and persistence. When she was extremely tired and her muscles and bones ached all over, she still gritted her teeth and finished practicing dancing. She understood her lack of knowledge. When her eyes were swollen from the mercury lights, she still studied hard on her own without interruption. When she was an extra, she never loafed around like other extras. When she was in the photography studio, she imitated the style of big stars. When she got home, she performed in front of the mirror. The mirror was her unyielding and un-flattering teacher. She analyzed and dissected herself like a biologist dissecting a new specimen. She relentlessly sought out her shortcomings and the methods to correct and remedy them. She was constantly striving for progress. So the current Joan Crawford is no longer Biltie Cassin, who used to be an extra. But people always like to say that she is lucky, and they always underestimate the hardships experienced by successful stars. Of course, there are heroes created by the times. But they gained success without any effort, and they will also lose success without any effort.</p>
<p>Grace Moore, a popular opera star, do you call her lucky? She escaped from a comfortable and wealthy family, not afraid of her parents disowning her, not afraid of hunger, not afraid of the pain of disappointment, just because she was determined to become an opera star. So she lived in a small apartment, singing in small restaurants during the day to earn food, and dancing in small theaters at night. All year round, she followed amateur acting troupes, running around. She also had to save money everywhere to prepare for her opera practice. She slowly rose to the position of leader in comedy, but when she wanted to learn opera, the owner of the Metropolitan Opera told her: "Your throat won't do." But she ignored everything, gave up her superior position in the comedy troupe, and ran to Italy to specialize in opera for two years. When she returned to New York two years later, she was a completely new person. The Metropolitan Opera and all lovers of high-level music bowed down to her. It's because she refused to admit defeat. She may have a natural singing voice, but if she didn't have the courage and determination that nature gave her, she wouldn't have been able to train her singing voice to its current level. From this it can be seen that there are many people in the world who are endowed with glorious singing voices, but those who are not afraid of hardship to train it are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>I can also mention the experiences of several courageous big stars who came out. Ruth Chatterton was originally a pillar of a traveling theater troupe, but she was willing to run up debts and ran to Hollywood to try her luck. As a result, she became the first female star in the sound film era. Maurice Chevalier was booed off the stage and fled by the audience for three consecutive nights when he performed in Paris, but on the fourth night he still took the stage as usual, causing the audience to stand up and cheer for him. Clark Gable was almost starving to death when he first worked as an extra, but he resolutely worked hard and eventually became extremely popular. When Janet Gaynor first arrived in Hollywood, the film company authorities told her that she had nothing attractive and should go home as soon as possible, but she said that she would definitely succeed. As a result, where there is a will, there is a way. Her success has become a good story in film history. Anna Sten used to wash dishes in a small Russian deli in Kiev. But she decided to study acting and was able to come to Hollywood and become a big star who made a splash. People who have seen Helen Hayes's plays say that Helen Hayes is a gifted genius. But she herself tells people about her past hard training and the various hardships she suffered in drama school. People admire Jeanette MacDonald's gorgeous clothes. But Jeanette herself tells people that when she was a dancer, her fellow dancers laughed at her for wearing cotton clothes, and they didn't know that she was unwilling to waste a penny, but saved it to pay for tuition at drama school. As a result, she broke away from the class of dancers, and those who used to laugh at her felt ashamed.</p>
<p>Courage, ambition, and the ability to make decisions are three virtues! In the Hollywood film industry, as in other industries, they are the key to success. We should admire Joan Nede, a new female star. When she was a child, after she had infantile paralysis, people said that she was a cripple for life, but she was unwilling to give up on herself. She practiced dancing, not only became physically strong, but also became a song and dance star. Alice White jumped from a female reporter to a female star. After failing again, she went through all kinds of hardships and has now regained her former position. Gloria Swanson used to be a bather in two-reel comedies and became a first-class star. Greta Garbo was a waiter in a barbershop in Sweden. Charlie Chaplin was a poor child on London's Jewish street and has now become the richest man in the film industry. Wallace Beery was a mahout who looked after elephants when he was a child. Charles Laughton used to be a clerk in a hotel. The rest of the people are too numerous to mention, all of whom have risen from hard work and self-improvement. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Fragrant Wildflowers"</h3>
<p>KansasOityPrincess</p>
<p>丨Da Guangming Film Review丨</p>
<p>After watching "Fragrant Wildflowers," it felt like reading a piece of "yellow journalism" embellished and highlighted by reporters at the expense of paper and ink, inevitably leaving one with a sense of "waste."</p>
<p>The story unfolds from the side of two manicurists. Rosanne falls in love with a young hooligan named Dina, while Mary is a manipulative womanizer. Because the former was swindled out of her engagement ring by another hooligan and couldn't face her lover, she disguised herself and blended into the girl scout's special train with the latter to escape to New York. However, Dina caught up with her when she got off the train, so the two jumped into a car in a hurry, flirted with two American country gentlemen in the car, and then followed them onto a mail ship bound for Paris.</p>
<p>What about Dina? He also sneaked onto the ship and became a bodyguard for Alan, a wealthy American who was going to Paris to find his wife. He met the two women again during a manicure opportunity.</p>
<p>Alan suspected that his wife was having an affair with a Russian doctor in Paris, so he specially hired a Parisian detective to investigate. When the detective reported that it was true, he set up a honey trap, using Mary's beauty to seduce the doctor into a trap.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the detective used his entrusted task to collude with Mrs. Alan and extort a large sum of money. After Alan lost both money and woman, he fell in love with Mary, and Rosanne and Dina got married.</p>
<p>This inherits the common problems of Hollywood movies: the story is empty, the structure is loose, and the ending is vulgar. We would like to ask, why would a woman like Rosanne prefer Dina? And how could a hooligan like Dina desperately chase after her again and again by plane and ship? Since they loved each other so much, why couldn't one of them explain clearly after losing the ring, and instead just run away? Since the prerequisite for this script's subject matter is empty and unreasonable, it is followed by some accidental and coincidental events, such as Mary and Rosanne meeting American country gentlemen who take them on the ship, Alan hiring a sudden and seemingly kidnapper-like person as a bodyguard, and the reunion during a manicure, and the Russian doctor being easily seduced, all of which are fantasies and nonsense, so the so-called "gags" are not very "funny" at all.</p>
<p>If we were to find some advantages in "Fragrant Wildflowers," it would be the considerable exposure of the "collusion" of so-called lawyers and detectives. On the one hand, they are entrusted to handle a case, and on the other hand, they use the case to collude with the other party, extort money, or "eat oil cakes" from both sides. This is very realistic. Secondly, the way manicurists use crying and laughing to swindle money from gentlemen, and how gentlemen use money to play with women, can also be considered somewhat satirical.</p>
<p>The director was able to achieve this with such an empty script as mentioned above, which is commendable. The play features characters of four nationalities: English, French, American, and Russian. The director's ability to express each person's character and habits in a not-too-exaggerated manner is indeed worthy of praise. Among them, the American gentleman is portrayed most fully, and the few strokes of the Russian doctor are also quite outlined. The weaving between the scenes and the handling of the atmosphere are also very clear and rhythmic.</p>
<p>Joan Blondell's Rosanne and Glenda Farrell's Mary both perform equally hard, but comparatively speaking, the latter performs better. Among the male characters, the one who plays Alan performs more naturally and successfully than the one who plays Dina, even though the latter has a much heavier role than the former.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Watching "Remarriage"</h3>
<p>— Fei Nianzu</p>
<p>"Remarriage" is an ordinary story, but it achieved great results in its performance, and can be called a very successful work by the star company.</p>
<p>Of course, the reality of the subject matter and the strictness of the structure are the only elements of the film's success, and the director's consistent efforts are also an undeniable fact. His simple and clear technique is worthy of our praise, especially his great grasp of the portrayal of the characters in the play, and his considerable cleverness in the insertion of several gags: such as college students holding chairs to learn to dance, and returning to school in the middle of the night, climbing over the wall, and fat people accidentally falling into the water tank, which are hilarious.</p>
<p>Actors: Gao Zhanfei played a prodigal son this year, with a glib tongue and a new style. Gao Qianping played a spoiled young girl, performing very realistically, and has made greater progress than in "Daughter's Classic." Yan Yuexian did not achieve special results due to poor makeup, but was generally competent. Xie Yunqing's old country man was lifelike, with amazing results.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that there are too many subtitles, which is an inevitable flaw in this film.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter Become Sisters</h3>
<p>Since "Life," there has been no new work from Lin Chuchu, this typical figure of a virtuous mother and good wife. Recently, it has been decided that she will star in two plays. This is naturally news that people like to hear.</p>
<p>These two plays are "National Customs," co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Zhu Shilin, and "Family Ethics," co-directed by Luo Mingyou and Mu. In both of these films, she plays the mother.</p>
<p>Lin Chuchu is always able to maintain her mother's position in "National Customs," but Ruan Lingyu is not. Because Ruan had played a mother and daughter with Li Lili in "Little Toys," this time, Lin Chuchu became their mother, and Ruan and Li became sisters.</p>
<h3>Publication News of Literary Films</h3>
<p>Amidst the excitement of magazine years, it is recently heard that a new semi-monthly "Literary Film" will be published in the New Year of 1935. The publication is edited by Ling He and is a comprehensive publication of literary, film, comics, and drama art departments. The first issue includes novels by Ai Wu and Shating, comics by Hu Kao and Chen Jingsheng, a film script by Zheng Junping, and famous works of film and drama by Sun Shiyi, Tang Na, Bao Shi, Zhou Boxun, and Yuan Muzhi. The comic photos are mostly colorfully printed and are very gorgeous. Moreover, the price is low, only fifteen cents per copy.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Merry Widow (I)</h3>
<p>— Suhua</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, starring Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier</p>
<p>A majestic mansion stood lifelessly in a small town in the Kingdom of Masovia. Originally, the surroundings of this house were always full of joy. But she 丨Sulia was the unhappiest widow in the world. Masovia is a country that does not compete with the world, and war will never happen. Money? Sulia's property donation is the lifeline of the national economy. But poor 丨丨Masovia's widow! Bound by etiquette, she even had to wear a black and thick veil when going out. She walked listlessly to the lampstand by the bed, opened the drawer and took out her diary. She turned the pages one by one, and a melancholy expression appeared on her slender face at the same time. She turned to the page of July 2, which read: "Dear diary, I am now a widow!" Going down page by page, each page only read: "Nothing is worth writing about!" She sighed, put on her veil and went to the garden. The silver brilliance of the bright moonlight spread across the earth. The intoxicating music from the servants' room made her sit on the stone bench and quietly appreciate it. She looked at the moon and sang a song. When the melancholy singing filled the garden, it was suddenly stopped by a man's singing. She looked over in a hurry and saw a young soldier climbing on the wall. She stood up in panic, and the man had already jumped down, greeting her lightly and saying, "Please don't be alarmed, aren't we all very lonely?" She was about to shout when he took out a letter from his pocket: "An important letter." He said, handing it to her. She secretly looked at him while receiving the letter. A young soldier, with blue eyes and a funny mouth. At that time, he bowed very respectfully and said, "This is a very important letter, I want to wait for a reply." Sulia opened the letter, and she read it, and then slowly read the letter: "Please always think of Tang Erna, he is very alarming." She thought for a while and said, "I don't know who Tang Erna is," he replied in a hurry, "He is Viscount Tang Erna 丨that is me." Sulia asked again, "Who wrote this letter?" The man replied, "I wrote it." Sulia said inexplicably, "I really don't understand, what exactly do you want?" "What I want is just your reply 丨丨" Sulia then ordered him to leave here immediately in an angry tone. She turned to run. But Tang Erna stopped her and said in a gentle voice, begging, "Let me stay a little longer." Sulia straightened her body and glared at him, saying, "I really don't believe that the Royal Guard actually······" "Dares to be wanton towards the most powerful woman. He continued for her. She was really annoyed. He still begged with a hippie smile, "Let you be in my position, if you tell me beautiful lies, and I always wear a veil, then won't you have insomnia at night because of imagining my face?" Sulia listened, furiously pushed him away, and walked towards her house, but Tang Erna still stopped her and asked her to take off the veil. Sulia replied to him with dignity, "Take off the veil? That's possible, but there's no need to take it off now." After she finished speaking, she ran inside without looking back. Tang Erna stood outside the door for a while, straightened his clothes, and then followed in with big strides. On the stairs, Sulia turned to look at this uninvited guest. In the light, he was handsome and extraordinary, indicating that he was a man from Masovia. He looked at her coldly and said, "Madam, I tell you for the last time, our romance is over. Don't think about me anymore. Don't even dream about me." After he finished speaking, he said good night, bowed and left. (To be continued)</p>
