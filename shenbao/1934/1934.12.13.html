<p>自馬賽慘案發生以來。南匈關係。時見緊張。血近數日。前以南國下令驅逐匈僑。形势尤爲險惡留心國際問題。者莫不認爲又一國聯棘手之難題不謂。一二日來。經英法意三國代表之斡旋。不獨南國政府自動終止驅逐匈僑之行。動卽匈國對於國聯行政院通過之决。議亦居然加以接受自「九一八」以來。國聯對於國際重要爭端之調解當以此次爲最順利矣。然國聯對於南匈之爭所以有若是之成就者。亦自有其特殊之原因。</p>
<p>撮要言之。約有三端。（一）支持國聯之英法意。力能控制南匈之關係。（二）爲英法意對於歐洲之現狀。有一比較共同的觀點。（三）法意兩國正謀積極的妥恊蓋，法意之目的在使德國不能對外發展而英國之目的則。在定歐局。俾其得有應付歐洲以外任何事變之餘力。有此諸因。故凡足以增加歐洲纠紛之問題。以及妨碍法意近之事件。三國無不願盡力消弭之。蓋捨此而外。更無其他途徑也。　　英國對於歐洲大陸事件。本取潔身自好政策。加之保守黨之對俄。猶懷疑忌對於法國之聯俄不能不能不有幾分戒心。徒以遠東有日本勢力之威脅。西方有德國態度之瞹眛。遂使其對於法國之外交政策。不能爲相當之恊調。此英國所以盼望歐洲安定之動機也。至法國。自失去波蘭臂助之後。極欲結好於意大利。以期「失之東隅收桑榆」。此固甚爲明顯者也。至於意大利自今夏以來。對德態度。然大變。蓋前此每以法國爲勁敵者。今乃轉與默契。方意人與匈奥結合之初。本欲藉以分法國在中歐之勢力。德人不能乘機利用法意之對立。毅然與意携手。遂使法意關係。日臻安善。法意旣不願因南匈糾紛而多生枝節。則南匈蝸角之爭。自難以擴大也。又據最近英美報紙所載。法意妥恊條件。除地中海海軍平等之外。尚有凖備談判非洲殖民地問題之説。墨索里尼所希望者。（一）爲法屬突尼斯之鐖拔斯蒂。（二）爲法屬東非撒馬里蘭除海口外之土地。（三）爲意人在法屬突尼斯蒂之特殊地位。展十年雖談判之結果如何。尚有待於賴伐爾羅馬之行。而二國關係之日益接近。則固爲識者所共見也。</p>

<p>嗣世界報界將「滿」方對蘇聯僑民虐待情形、均予批露、故「滿洲政府」不得不以正式說帖答覆上述蘇聯總領之抗議、「滿國」駐哈特派員施履本於十一月六日發岀說帖一通、其措辭乖離、非尋常外交文件所能見、施氏力稱「滿」方此類行動之合法、僅謂獄囚所犯罪名「性質萬分嚴重、且所涉頗廣」、「其中心乃在中東鐡路」、而於究犯何罪一節、絕未道及、施氏否認應用毒刑、謂罪犯待遇「未越常規」、　　十一月二十六日蘇聯駐哈代理總領萊維德答稱、施氏說帖對蘇聯總領所請、並未圓滿答覆、施氏函内對若干非法逮捕與侵犯行爲之具體事實、槪無明确答覆、同時關於此等非法行動、應受何等處分各節、均未述及、該函所及者僅爲表示「滿」方盡力避免關於該案重要關鍵三答覆之普通聲明而已、萊氏追述其屡次提及之要求、卽請吿知［被捕人員究在何處、此等案件究由法庭審理、抑由行政當局研訊、並稱、此類請求「滿」方均置之不理、而十一月六日施氏所作說帖、亦未道及、施氏對於蘇聯被捕公民所犯何罪問題、不作具體答覆　僅謂「獄囚所犯罪名、性質異常嚴重、且所涉頗廣、同時所犯已非一次」云云、對此亦不加任何理由、此種絕無根據與理由之聲明、决不能視爲「滿」方非行動之解釋、按照常理、犯人被捕原因旣異常嚴重、同時初步偵查亦已二個半月至三月、則其在刑法上究經所犯何條何欵、至少已能查明、故於蘇聯公民一百五十人、「所犯罪名之嚴重」之普通聲明、决不能認爲滿意也、萊氏更進一步指明、一部份「滿」方當局力圖爲中東路蘇籍路員揑造罪名、此項誣吿至爲背謬、亦從未證實、因彼等初未犯罪也、　　萊氏追述彼對獄囚備受嚴刑一再提岀之抗議、且重述若干新事實云、「九月四日閣下接得關於獄囚哥洛維娜及格里哥耶夫之體格檢騐證明書、哥格二人曾受哈爾濱憲兵之拷打、九月十四日副領事特列平司基將蘇民格伏德夫之染血内衣示君、格氏爲路警逮捕、其内衣及由警察交彼家庭者、十月三日同副領事吿閣下、請蘇氏巴賽林及卜洛維克備受刑訊、遂成殘廢、十月十三日復將蘇民奥薩杜克所受酷刑吿君、十五日予復吿君、奥氏已受刑過重斃命、十月十九日予復吿君、另有古爾巴賽基者在滿洲里鎭爲邊警嚴刑拷訊、傷重逝世、予曾與君屡次談及蘇氏基司洛夫及旁什金兩人之運命、並將此案驚人消息吿君、據予所得確實報吿、此兩人者亦在邊境警隊長官手中傷重殞命矣、當局對此雖作不甚聰明之聲明、然此亦僅在掩蓋此項罪行耳、同時當局嚴厲拒絕總領代表與獄囚會見一舉、已足邆明嚴刑拷訊實爲事實、同時當局正向總領館方而掩飾此等行爲也、上所云云、對於哈爾濱綏芬河及其他各地蘇聯公民所受嚴刑之消息、（此等事件爲予一再抗議之對象）、猶未盡量述及、閣下對此似宜具體答覆、並宜說明已用何種辦法嚴懲此等罪犯、不令此類事件重復發生、唯君對此等事實、竟絕未道及、僅稱當局於審訊之際、絕未嚴刑拷打、此種答覆僅足表示、滿洲領袖政治機關顯欲利用其最高當局之權威、掩護警官及憲兵對於蘇聯人民之非法暴行、並令人以爲政府對於此等行動正予鼓勵　不加處罰也、因此「滿洲」最高政府機關關於上述刑訊非法行爲、應向蘇聯政府負其完全責任、故予以蘇聯外交人民委員會代表之資格、敢爲君吿曰、閣下十一月六日對於予所申請與抗議各點之答覆、全部不能令人滿意、予今證實前此予對「滿」方對於蘇聯公民非法逮捕及行刑之抗議、並再堅决要求、速將前此非法逮捕之蘇籍公民、一體釋放、澈底停止對於彼等用刑、並對用刑拷訊者予以嚴懲、最後、蘇聯公民以此等警官與憲兵之行爲所遭受之一切損失、予當責任「滿洲政府」機關應負道　與物質之全責、同時予於各個蘇聯公民因遭非法逮捕與刑訊所受之損失、以及蘇民基司洛夫·勞什金·古爾巴茨基·及奥薩杜克·以在滿洲監獄内受刑致死之損失、予當保留爲彼等及死者家屬要求賠償之權利」云、（十二日塔斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　脫離政友會之衆議院秋田議長、當卽發表聲明書、其今日脫離政友會黨籍、同時且採取辭衆院議長之手續、但不辭衆院議員、至於脫離政友會之理由因今後欲將自身置於自由之境地、專事鑽研修養、爲國宣勞、卽欲將過去政治關係清算一切、重復努力爲國、卽鑑於目下之内外政情、發奮雄、心努力向政界淨化前進、（十二日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）　民政黨雖與新黨組並無直接關係、但一部幹事與内田鐵相有若干諒解、且有關政氏聯携、故將來殊堪重視、多數幹部以床次氏爲中心、以第一控室·國民同盟之多數·及政友會内床次系之議員結成新黨、又黨魁將推高橋藏相、若高橋藏相不允就任時將輪及床次氏、而新黨與民政黨、將締結友黨關係、（十二日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　政友會内紛爆發之兆、愈趨顯著、野田總務於十一日繼加藤·東胎中諸氏、向鈴木總裁提岀辭表、於是事態及重大化政友會因於今夜召開總務會恊議對策、幹部方面將努力慰留、惟方陷混亂狀態之大勢、一時難以收拾、（十二日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）　衆議院議長秋田氏辭去議長職務、脫離政友會、實給與政界以莫大衝動、蓋以秋田之爲人素主穏健、非有把握、决不見諸行動、故此次脫離政友會、似有相當把握與决心、該氏今後之行動、頗被各黨所注目、因該氏之脫黨、而政黨之分解作用亦將發生、故於政界之分野上、或當成爲變化之基因、如前任鐡相三土氏及前田米藏·山本條太郎·野田俊作等等舊政友系幹部人員、亦有脫黨之說、且政友會岀身之閣員對於創立新黨之運動、亦行使各種宣傳、故今日秋田氏之脫黨、亦不能謂爲毫無關係、此後之進行若何、般一人士極爲注目、（十二日日聯電）</p>

<h3 id="c99">美國經濟狀况重見穩定（美國通信 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>恐慌暫减事業漸興</p>
<p>軍縮前夕努力自勉</p>
<p>經濟恐慌的中心問題、在美國是失業問題、其失業人數雖没有正確統計、但多數專家的估算、都以爲有一千一百萬以至一千二百五十萬、而連帶着要救濟的家族人員、大約有四百萬人、所以這是美國當前的最重大問題、如若得到適當的解决、則美國經濟就會恢復、資本主義組織許會因此而重新穩定、所以過去一年半時期中、對於這件事是上下所注意的大問題、</p>
<p>在八月底、羅斯福總統於說明「新政策」之際、曾講到「政府企圖國民經濟之調整、確立没有失業羣存在的國家原則、現在先要講究消滅已有的失業羣、其次要考究的賢明對策、是使失業没有再生的餘地、」</p>
<p>這種話、自羅斯福氏就職以來、卽已說過了的、現在重述從前的意思、不過詞句上略有變换而已、最近幾個月間、失業者的實際數量、非但比較增加起來、而且勞資糾紛不斷的發生、糾紛的關係一次比一次更擴大、舊金山碼頭工人罷工是比較大的了、而紡織工人的罷工就更大、如此推演下去、整個的黃金世界、北美合衆國經濟情勢、是很可慮的、因爲勞資衝突尖銳化的結果　誰也不敢保險、絕不發生意外、所幸是紡織工人罷工後、總統岀任調停、現在已經得到相當的解答　短時期内、不致於有大運動了、</p>
<p>然而失業問題還是很大、所以全美國總工會會長威廉格林主張的每週三十小時工作制、很引起一般人的注意、他說「到了冬季、應該特别注意的是要從饑餓與寒冷之中去救濟失業者、保證他們最低水準的生活、并且還要伸一隻手對失業者的家族加以適當的救濟、」他以爲工人的工作時間、如果縮短至每週五小時、則現時的每週四十小時至四十五小時制改變之後、就會有一百七十萬人、立刻得到工作、勞工長官巴根斯對這種意見表示好感、而顧主方面却多數不贊同、所以今年冬天恐怕還有多少小問題、但大體上是勉强可以過去了、</p>
<p>照紐約時報所調查、全美事業活動總指數（假定其常態爲一○○）則六月中旬爲八五一、八月中旬七八·六、九月中旬竟低到七一·九了、這與去年四月金融恐慌後的情形差不多、其中尤以鋼鐡工業爲最厲害、其實際工作不過本年六月的百分之四十、等於全工作能力的百分之二○·九、紡織工業也因爲罷工和消路窄小的關係、九月初間每週生産棉布僅七千五百萬平方碼、比六七月間每週平均少二千五六百萬平方碼、</p>
<p>但是一般社會大衆的購買力、九月比八月增加了九百多萬美金、建築契約也增加了一百多萬美金、工業股票九月中也漲了七八圓美金、前途和希望增大、恢復的曙光又重現一綫、因爲這種關係、所以政府當局膽子又壯些、國内問題有了相當把握、對外纔能盡量準備、特别是應付十月間要開的軍縮豫備會議、</p>
<p>此間所聞、日本將力主廢除以往的海軍條約、及軍備平等、美國對這一點、决不肯約鬆、他以爲和平基礎是建立在華盛頓條約和倫敦恊定上的、假設一旦廢除了這兩項條約、則新約不易成立　、太平洋均勢打破之後、世界危機也會隨着到來海軍競爭必更趨於激烈、所以美國在外交上要作切實的準備、要貫澈其和平主張、但事實上他的連手很少、日本當然恰和他對立、英國也不必一定左袒美國、在　政治上還有與日本同感的意味、然則軍縮會議破裂之後、海軍競爭是在意料之中、素以商務爲中心的美國製造工業界、恐怕也不免會轉其機輪於軍事工業、目前還看不岀這種痕蹟、可是將來何如、我們也不難想像得之、（一九三四年十月十日於紐約）</p>

<p>章淵若講　　　　（李光滕筆記</p>
<p>上海市敎育會爲普及國際智識起見、特舉行播音演講、首次播音、聘由政治學者章淵若氏擔任　講詞頗爲警惕、茲覓得原稿如左、諸位先生　今天承本市敎育會的盛意、請兄弟來播音演講、非常愉快、今天所講的題目、是中國應取何種方針、應什世　」本題目的範圍很廣、若要詳細　論、非今日時間所許、祇能從下列二點研究、</p>
<h3 id="c196">一·世界形勢的透視 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>未來的世變、到底是在什麽時候、什麽地方發生、關心這點、許多學者·政治家·外交家·意見各異、有的說未來戰爭的中心是在歐洲太陸方面、有的却說在遠東方面爆發、　兩種說法、都有他們見解和可能性、究竞歐洲與遠東方面、孰先孰　、兄弟亦不敢武斷、（我前在青年會講、一九三六年歐洲的大陸　曾說得很詳細　諸位　在報章上參考、）不過、這兩個地方、其實都是未來世界的火藥庫、隨時有爆發戰爭的可能性、據美儒史梯爾說、二次世界大戰、將起於　之　奪　兩遠東方面、則是起於日本進攻東部西比利亞、兄弟以爲國際關係很錯綜複雜、牠們都有一種不可分解的　環性、就是、遠東聯系歐陸歐陸亦聯系遠東、這兩個地方、都是未來世界戰爭的爆發地、不過比較的說、　東方面的爆發性、來得大吧了、這理由　是一、大　後、世界政治的重心已從大西洋移到太平洋、二、現在列强利益爭　的焦點、也就在遠東、三、日本軍人好大喜功、同時他們國家没有吃過大戰的苦、總想試試逞他們的野心、據最近兩日報載日本已自動　棄海約、　樣、遠東的均勢、自然受其影響、同時也是象徴着世界的未來大戰益有降臨的可能從這一個世界形勢簡單的分析中、我們可以推想到、世界未來的大戰、如果一旦在遠東爆發我們就要受着如何嚴重而危險的影響了、這是頭一點、</p>
<h3 id="c197">二·吾人應取之方針 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>其次的問題、就是　假使未來世界的大戰、是在遠東爆發將以　　個國家爲主體呢、是日俄嗎、抑是日美、同時遠東方面、會成什麽局面、我們中國在此危機中、　採取什麽方針、方能保障民族生存、　可簡單地分四項來講、（甲）遠東方面戰爭的主體、我以爲是日俄　因爲從歴史上看日俄是歷史的仇敵、日俄利益之衝突、比日美尤重尖銳、日本自從佔領朝鮮後、處心積慮、向中國東北發展、自九一八後與俄國衝突、更爲尖銳、日美雖也衝突得很利害但日本向分海洋政策、大陸政策兩派、海洋政策的敵人　標、當然是美國、大陸政策的敵人　標、又當然是蘇俄現在日本方從事其大陸政策之發展、較海洋政策尤爲着重、而蘇俄的備戰　亦較美爲激烈（乙）一旦遠東方面　爭發生、我們在决定應付方針以前、須先切　精密分析國際間的利害形勢、始克　付裕如　我們固不能武斷大戰爆發後究將呈何局面　　是須看一個國家外交政策如何定的、換句話說、局勢並不是完全被動的而是可由我們來支配的、據常熊來推測大概那時可以成美俄聯合日的陳容、我們從美俄復交、就　證明有美俄聯合抗日的　勢與可能、至於英國的外交、素抱「坐收漁利」的政策、我們現在雖不大容易捉摸到英國的外交政策、因爲他處處不肯輕易表示態　、其實英日的利害衝突、究竟已成一種公開的秘密、這是稍明國際關係的人、所可透視到的因爲現世是資本主義的世界、尤其是「重商主義」的大英帝國、她是以經濟利益爲前提的、大家都知道、大英帝國的基礎、是遠東、是印度、假如日本在遠東作威作福、獨霸太平洋、勢必動摇英帝國遠東的國防外綫、英國便無法維持他在印度的基礎、則在地理的關係上、她非一直退到蘇　士不可、這不是整個的英帝國主義的崩潰嗎、所以倘使未來遠東戰爭發生、美俄英　有聯合的可能性的、許多人或者會說、英和美在遠東的衝突、亦頗不小、但是我們要曉得、英美雖不免有衝突然一旦眞逹到遠東戰爭爆發的時候則在她殖民地的地理關係上、英美種族的關係上、她們終必互相聯成　氣、合力抗日的、（關於道　請參看英國視察報主筆伽文之社論、十一月三日英　哈瓦斯電）（丙）我們現在就要說到中國於此未來世變中、究應取什麽方針了、無疑地、我們目前最大的敵人、是日本帝國主義者、我們如果要想應付這一個危機　如果要想從死裏逃生、最要緊的、就要能够善爲　用日俄日美日英她們的互相衝突、來造成一個中俄美英聯合制日的大陣營、道樣則日本當然要在「四面楚歌」的大包圍中　陷於孤立、而自趨崩潰了（未完）</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>數年來在這國難中過生活，没有什麽樂觀的事實，可以表見。惟有提倡國貨這一件事，却多少有些小小功效，隨便到什麽地方，大家總覺得提倡國貨，是在經地義的，服用國貨，是人人應盡的負任。一個公司的小職員嘴裏，乃至經濟專家如馬寅初　在講台上在論文裏，都是説救中國，救經濟國難，挽回白銀流出外洋的惟一方法，只有提倡國貨，服用國貨。近年來各方一致提但國貨的成效，你只須到國貨公司裏去看看，男女顧客的擁擠，國貨工廠裏一批一批貨品的製造，便覺得多少有些樂觀。張公權氏在前天中華國貨産銷合作恊會中演説：（同様十個月的入超，一九三二年，是六萬萬九千萬元，一九三三年，是五萬萬七千萬元，今年一九三四年，只有一萬萬五千萬元，這不能不歸功於提倡國貨的效力。此後國貨界大家合作起來，埋頭地改良製造，减輕成本，督促政府增加關稅。同業中再謀進一步的結合，那麽，經濟國難，是我們國貨界發展的好機會。卽是一致恐慌的白銀潮，也可以藉此解决。）張先生這一篇對於國貨前途樂觀的話，的確鼓勵我們國貨界的男氣和熱忱。我想國貨界同志當然藥於接受這話，並且樂予努力的。</p>
<p>國貨獻議</p>
<h3 id="c202">建議給（學生國貨年） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>時代的輪子不斷向前輾着，在）婦女國貨年（將要臨去秋波的時候，那前進的時間軌道上，却已寫好了（學生國貨年）這五個大字，顯然的，這是努务國貨者不屈不撓的表示，今年的失敗，還要收獲於明年的成功，所謂治五年之病，决非一朝一夕所蹴成，我們正應本着繼續努力，貫澈始終的精神，去徐圖進展，而際此送舊迎新的當兒，自更應有偉大的企圖，並確定一個嚴密的計劃及方針，作未來進行的借鏡，從黑暗的途中，再去找尋奮鬥的出路。</p>
<p>不過，（前車可鑒），我們在再接再厲的前途，應當竭力避免再蹈過去的覆轍，並要知道，（婦女國貨年）失敗的原因何在？一言以蔽之，它是因爲没有脚踏實地去幹，尤其一般太太，小姐們，她們更忘却了應盡的義務，應負的使命，對於洋貨的酷好，崇拜，絲毫没有稍稍改除，使驚人的香永，脂粉入口數，成了鐵證的事實丨我們一課失敗和痛心的教調。</p>
<p>所以，（學生國貨年）將要開始的時候，（未雨綢繆），我們應得先認識清楚，學生本是社會最優秀的分子，有作有爲的青年，他們的一舉一動，在在足以轉移全民族的視聽，受人重視，啟人信仰，過去五四，五卅的抵貨運動，便是有力的證據，現在把這責任，去交他們駕輕就熟的引用，自可更得）事半功倍）的效果，不過，話雖如此，單是空洞的呐喊，終於無用，我們應當要有切實的建議來，在下面，我就依個人的意見，提出了兩點，望急需去採納和施行。</p>
<p>一，學校禁用洋貨自明年元旦起，全國學校應一律採用國貨，舉凡服裝，文具，儀器，設備，以及一切雜用器具，務須絶對禁用洋貨，並由教師，學生聯合組織服用國貨委員會，互相監督，負檢查之責任，如雙方發生違犯情事，卽須受最嚴厲的處分。</p>
<p>二，實施國貨教育，國貨教育的呼聲，由來已久，而迄未施行，但到明年丨學生國貨的年頭裏，却必要去切實施行了，如對於服用國貨的原因，辨别國貨的常識，最好須由教育部編定課本，分令各校授讀，予以薰陶，並組國貨講演會，於星期休假，聘請國貨名人，到校演講，使更獲興趣，這様，我想明年的成績，一定可較本年爲滿意吧！</p>

<h3 id="c203">國貨廣告與播音 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 導溱</p>
<p>現化廣告衛之邁進，日新月異，大有一日千里之勢，報紙有報紙廣告，刋物有刋物廣告，甚至有路牌牆壁廣告，電力活動廣告；近數年來，自無綫電興，凡在大都市裏或電氣事業發達之區，均有利用其播送廣告，任户居民，祗須備具收音機一架，悉可聆入耳鼓，雖然足不出户，亦能洞知時事新聞，國際消息，商業情形，以及新興商品之行銷等等，洵爲傳遞消息極靈便迅速之工具。</p>
<p>以滬地一隅而論，廣播電臺之設立，大大小小，不下二百家，其間播送國際消息時事新聞者，輒居少數，大半以營業性質爲多，專門播送工廠商號家之廣告；以吾平昔之考查，國貨廠商委以播送者，仍屬寥寥，間有如中西藥房之自備及家庭工業社假李樹德堂者，亦如鳳毛麟角，蓋未能作大規模之普遍宣傳，實憾事也。</p>
<p>須如，值此商業競爭外貨傾銷之際，吾國貨工廠，非實行薄利多賣廣告，宣傳，則不足以鞏固本身地位，爲國貨事業謀進展；以吾意，國貨廠商，對於出品之推銷，舍報紙刋物各種廣告以作宣傳外，於無綫電臺之播音，亦匯按照季節，或適應環境與需要，相機播送，自可收到事半功倍之效；吾願未加入者，從速嘗試，已加入乾，須顧及左列兩點；</p>
<p>第一，介紹出品特質，須説明到此種品質確較外貨爲優價值確較外貨爲慶之處，藉播音員之流利生活的口物，作娓娓動聽引人入勝的宣傳，其所收之吸引能力，定不可以道里計。</p>
<p>第二，介紹國貨出品時，須以仇貨洋貨作對照，譬如説；）家庭工業社的無敵牌牙粉，可以代替仇貨的金剛石牌牙粉，）（無敵牌女兒霜可以代替洋貨的棕欖霜及白玉霜，（）振興毛羢廠的雙龍牌毛絨綫右以代替洋貨的蜜蜂牌毛絨綫，）民生工廠民生牌墨水可以代替洋貨的司梯芬與華德門墨水，）（利中銅銼廠的鋼版可以代替仇貨的謄寫版）······諸如此類，不但可以做了廣告，抑且灌輸一盤人們極好的鑑别國貨和非國貨智識與觀念，豈不是一舉而　得？</p>

<p>— 金甲</p>
<p>話説多九公的船，行駛了多日，一天，風平浪靜，唐敖一早起來，指着前面一塊陸地説；（連日悶在船上，無聊極了，船上的食物，積着久時，再不靠岸，怕不够我們喫了。）於是多九公等都靠船邊來　，林之洋間多九公這是什麽地方？多九公搖搖頭説；（老夫當年遍遊名海大洲，却未曾到過這裏。（却説談談説説，輪已靠了岸，於是三人都上岸來了。</p>
<p>三人在岸邊走，前面走來一個人，面貎倒像中土人士，可是服裝却，很希奇，鈕扣生在衣服中央，衣領却翻下來，褲脚特别長，鞋子也很奇特，不用綢緞，却用黑而且硬的東西做的。唐敖第一個上去，施個敬禮，隨後問道；（先生貴姓，這裏呌什麽地名？）那人倒很有禮貎，不過看見他們穿的是長衫，布鞋，好似輕視似的。一面却回答説；（兄弟楊虎高就是，敝地喚名無貨國。不知衆位那裏來的。（林之洋搶着説；（我們是中土人，因爲性喜遊歷各地，所以帶了中土貨物，到各地賣買一來可以多廣見聞，二來又可結交幾個朋友。（那人好似址分歡喜。唐敖心中也覺欣喜，這裏旣爲無貨國，因爲自已没貨物，今天船上的貨物，想來一定可以脫手了。</p>
<p>楊虎高又問；（那麽你們有些什麽呢？）多九公説；（中土有的是胭脂，白粉，花雕，土糖，布疋等等。先生不知要的是什麽？（誰知楊虎高呸了一聲説；（我險的上你們當，這些東西，這裏是没有人要的。窮的人難道連胭脂也要用嗎？告訴你吧！花雕等東西，没有人喝的。洋酒，白閘地，倒容易推銷。講到衣服，最窮的人也情願凍死，不願穿布的。看我丨巴黎緞襯衫，來路嗶嘰洋裝，這才可以穿穿。没空和你們頑固的講，我還要去加入提倡洋服籌備會去。</p>
<p>三人聽了莫名其妙。一連問了許多人，都是這般説法。不覺肚餓，在臨近一家名呌眞正老牌來路貨的菜館，橱窗還貼着一張紙條，上面寫着；（如有國貨冐充洋貨，罰銀一萬元。）十三個字。唐敖進了座，問茶博士説；（要點陳年花雕，再燒點本地名産。）誰千茶博士説；（先生。莫開頑笑，這些東西，這裏不可以喫的，不然請另就吧！）還是多九公機警，搶着説；（隨便你，弄點來路貨菜，再添點洋酒吧！我們不懂這裏風俗。）這才使茶博士悅服了。一壁説；（要不要茶？）這次唐敖也乖了些，説；（來路貨茶有嗎？弄三杯來。）茶博士欣然地去了。</p>
<p>一會兒，菜，茶，酒，都來了。林之洋呷了一口茶説；苦得要命。唐敖把酒瓶開了，不料裏面有汽似的白沬來，嚇得三人不敢喫。講到菜，不用筷，却用叉，刀，等東西。多九公等三人，只得乘博士不在，用手抓來喫。後來才送上三塊麵包和奶油，林之洋覺得不甚可口。也不喫了。茶博士拿過帳來，三人嚇得一跳，原來上面寫着。</p>
<p>付了錢來，又接到每人一包口香糖，其味並不好。包紙上印着（每件四角一四個字。多九公伸出舌來，半天不縮進去。三人商議了一會，眼看這裏是做不成注意，於是只得回船去。林之洋又買一份當地的報。在緊要新聞裏刋着一行大字；（本月份洋貨輸入達五千萬元。）旁邊註着，（國庫已虚，民財將盡）</p>
<p>多九公嗎道；（人民如此崇拜洋貨，國家怎不貧，人民怎不窮呢？）林之洋插着説；（那位楊虎高，我知道了，是洋貨高的諧音呀。可見人民心理一般了。）</p>
<p>唐敖等三人的船。又在波海裏駛去了。</p>
<p>眞正高導洋咖啡三杯　三元</p>

<p>— 望岑</p>
<p>經過了長時期的奮鬭，歷盡了許多的艱苦，鎧和玲的戀愛總算成功了。</p>
<p>他倆現在計劃着同居的事，第一先要解决住的問題，他們在愚園路兆豐公園左近，租到了一間廂樓，推開樓窗可以望見油油的綠樹，平坦的草園，這住宅的空氣使他倆非常滿意。他們又購辦了些簡單的器具，和日用的物品，於是一個小家庭的條件就齊備了；可是在這時候却有一種使他們感覺到很不便利的事！</p>
<p>因爲鎧和玲雖然都有職業，但是每月收入僅够他倆的費用，事實上是不能再傭一個人的；並且他倆也願意在家自任操作，實現節儉的生活，所苦的就是熱水的問題。原因是他們住宅附近没有老虎　，自已又不能到遠的地方去泡水，日間煮飯煮水是借用房東的爐　，有時夜間要用熱水，爐火却已經熄滅了！尤其是天氣漸漸地冷下來，清晨出去工作，洗面的時候没有熱水，鎧和玲常常因爲這事發生小小地不快！</p>
<p>一天，鎧從外邊回來，帶着一個紙包，並且歡喜地對玲説；</p>
<p>（玲，我們現在可在不再愁熱水的問題了。）</p>
<p>（爲甚？）玲問。</p>
<p>（我剛剛到五洲藥房出買了這個東西。）鎧邊説把他手裏的紙包打開，原來是一個熱水瓶。</p>
<p>（我早想到它了，只是洋貨的價錢很貴呢！）玲説。</p>
<p>（這是上等國貨地球牌熱水瓶。價錢很經濟，保暖的效力又非常凖確）丨鎧笑着説。</p>
<p>（你的設計很週到，你眞是我的愛人喲！）玲吻鎧的臉。</p>
<p>從此以後，無論在深夜黎明，他倆都有很熱的水用了。</p>

<p>第六回　貧女不能羞任教中視西賓何足貴空辱虚心</p>
<p>在他説完了走罷兩個字，已經是走過來了，手扶了月英，要他轉過身去。他隨了胡嫂子的手，轉過身去時，見那個穿藍布衣服的學生，還在那裏望着，百忙中會引起了這様一個人來注意，却是想不到的事。不過自已要去作那姨太太考試，那是成敗關頭，也就來不及管這些閑事了。小紀賞他們走到院子裏的時候，早已飛步向前，到賈多才屋子裏去報信。及至將信報過了，回頭看到身後無人，他可大爲找急，因之轉身又跑了回來，看到胡嫂子便跳脚道；你怎麽走得這個様子慢？胡嫂子推着月英道；他不好意思呢。小紀道；據賈先生説，你們都是交談過的人了，還有什麽不好意思。不過這様倒好，人家看了，多少有些趣味。月英聽他所説，簡直不是人話，不過在這個時候，多少還得仗他帮一點忙，也不敢駁他，不過是紅了臉，垂了眼皮子走路。到了賈多才門口，小紀搶上前一步，替他們掀着門簾子讓他們進去，等他們進去，立刻將簾子放下，他自已站在外面，並不進去。那賈多才架了腿坐着，在那裏抽紙烟，見他們進來了，那雙眼晴，早被月英煥然一新的衣飾吸收住了，他情不自禁的，哦哈了一聲，仿彿説這太美了，美得出乎意料以外了。月英緊緊的跟在胡嫂子身後，進來了，就靠了房門低頭站着。他害臊，胡嫂子也未嘗不害臊，上前兩步，也就退後兩步，他不向賈多才説話，却推着月英的肩膀道；走過去呀，本來就認得的，怎麽陡然害臊起來了呢？（八八）</p>

<p>— 望雲</p>
<p>崖門片土慈元殿，</p>
<p>猶有餘哀弔國魂！</p>
<p>自來備受異族壓迫的國家，莫慘於趙宋！先受遼金的蹂躝，後受胡元的呑滅，直至陸秀夫負了帝昺入海，大宋社禝遂亡於洪濤巨浸之中。楊太后得了兒子的死耗，痛器道；（我忍死艱難至此，正為趙氏一塊肉耳，今無望矣！」遂即跳海而死。太后行宫，呌做慈元殿，後人思宋不已，殿中祀宋國母楊氏，至今不廢。</p>
<p>其時，志在恢復江山的太傳張世傑，自從兵沮臯亭以後，猶欲冒死奮鬭，卒至君死國，臣死君，孤忠大節，照耀千秋。其祠在崖門，呌做大忠祠，並祀文天祥陸秀夫二公，也是至今不廢。</p>
<p>崖門，在新會縣南大海中，兩山卓立如扉，潮汐出没其間，形勢很壯。宋代帝王旣經投海身死，後來趙氏遺族，入籍新會，至今人丁繁盛。上月（十一月）二十二日，係趙族冬祭崖門慈元殿宋代國母的日期。事前，由三江霞露等鄉趙氏族人，籌備種竽祭品，並僱民船若干艘，分載趙姓諸耆老，往祭（痛哭一塊肉而身死的一宋代國母楊氏。是日，縣長黄槐庭，整理專員范國彦，新會地方法院院長李銘鼎等，均往參加致祭典禮。渡海南行，抵埠後，由各長官分任主祭員。慈元殿，由黄縣長主祭，大忠祠，由范專員主祭，尚有恢復未成而身死的諸義士祠，由李院長主祭，禮儀隆重，全塲肅穆，直至下午二時許，始告禮成，各與祭人員，旋卽分别散去。語云；（前事不忘，後事之師，）今茲國恥重重，大有南宋的外侮光景，官長致祭宋國母與大忠祠義士祠，也足以喚醒國魂，把趙宋作爲殷鑑。據趙族中人云；（此種隆重儀式的三獻大祭，在遜清光緒年間，曾經舉行一次，至今垂三十年，才有第二度的大祭，國母有知，定當銜感天上，我們族人的感激涕零，更不消説得了。）</p>

<p>戲館裏的名角兒，牌子上寫着斗大的金字，四面又裝了許多電燈，每天晚上，馬龍車水，大家爭着來聽他的戲。打聽打聽包銀，至少總得兩三千塊錢一個月，在一般人眼光中瞧去，像他們總該生活豪奢，起居優裕的了，那知道然而不然！</p>
<p>有一位文武老生，兩千塊錢一月的包銀，戲館裏掛的是他頭牌，他旣没有嗜好，又不出來胡調，誰知他却天天在打着飢荒！實在没法的時候，整箱的行頭，得往典當裏送！畢竟爲了甚麽緣故呢？原來他在這一次搭班以前，閑了有十個月，所以虧空了五千多。這回搭了班，第一得還債，此外行頭店裏，又欠了五六千，况且號稱名角的戲子，拉胡琴的，打鼓的，唱武戲的配角，一共要有十來家人家的烟　，靠着這位名角兒出烟。旣然掛的是頭牌，身上的行頭，又不能含糊，一件靠子是八十塊，一件蟒是一百二十，每個月裏，添新行頭這一項，至少得花上三五百，有此種種原因，所以他雖是賺着偌大的包銀，却天天在過大除夕！</p>
<p>這位文武老生，他有個癖性，憑你家裏開不出火艙，可是遇見心愛的東西，却非化錢買回來不可，一二八的時候，他搭的一家戲園子燒掉了，家裏的夥計們，全都啃着大餅過日子，好容易有位某聞人送給他一百塊錢，論理該回去糶米買柴才是！誰知他老人家懷裏揣着一百塊錢，走過一家古董店，瞧見有一柄削鐵如泥的寳劍，他非買不可，便化上八十塊，把寳劍買了回家，一家人只得依舊捱餓，他生了這副脾氣，所以憑你包銀加到一萬八千，他的經濟狀况，决不會變好！</p>

<p>— 吕夢蕉</p>
<p>橘爲常綠灌木，我國江淮一帶，及湘粤閩浙諸省皆藝之。幹高丈餘，秋日開白花，初冬結實，色黄綠不一。　多甜液，剖而食之，甘美沁齒。　東坡贈劉景文詩；（荷盡已無擎雨蓋，菊殘猶有傲霜枝，一年好景君須記，正是橙黄橘綠時）。覺當茲季節，對此佳果不能無辭，因作橘話。</p>
<p>前人於菊蟹牡丹之屬，譜述甚夥，惟橘獨尠，僅宋韓彦直著橘綠三卷而已。彦直延安人，　忠武王世忠之長子也。登紹興十年進士，官至龍圖閣學士。此譜乃淳熙中知温州時所作。上卷載柑品八，橙品一，而以泥山之乳柑爲首。中卷載橘品十八。下卷則言種植之法。其後陳景沂作全　備祖，於橘雖亦路及，然非專著也。</p>
<p>柑與橙，俱屬橘類，而不盡相同，惟通常每多混稱之。如閩中稱柑，廣東則稱甜橙，而以蜜橘爲柑是。故俗有（高身橙，扁身柑）之説，事詳新會志。實則柑色黄赤，橙色正黄。柑皮細緊，不易剥，橙皮粗糙易剥。柑咪甜，橙味酸。此中固有區别在焉。</p>
<p>産橘之佳者，閩不及浙，尤以浙之永嘉爲最。君芳譜云；（橘出蘇州，台州，西出荊州，南出閩廣撫州，皆不如温州爲上）。甌江逸志云；（永嘉之土宜橘，葉正則詩有林皆橘樹，無水不荷花是也）。其橋味極甘美，以無核者爲上。</p>
<p>泥山在平陽縣，延袤只三二里，以産乳柑負盛名。羣芳譜謂泥山之柑，味似乳酪，故名。其木婆娑，其婁纖長，其花香韻，其實圓正，其膚理如澤蠟，其大六七寸，其皮薄而味珍，脈不黏瓣，食不留滓，一顆僅二三核，亦有全無者，擘之香霧噀人，爲柑中絶品。</p>
<p>全芳佛祖别橙品爲五；日橙，日朱欒，日香欒，日金　，日枸橘。橙以産於廣東新會者爲佳，即俗稱新會橙是也。其頂有紋如圓圈，土人每以此辯眞僞。</p>
<p>漢武帝時，嘗於交趾設橘官，主貢御橘。者吳越間復置橘籍，吳　澤表日；（請除臣之橘籍），見述異記。</p>
<p>橘實内有纖質，絡繞谥皮　之間者，日橘絡。與橘之皮，俱可入藥。</p>
<p>又有名熏柑者，橘錄云；橘徵損，則去皮，以肉瓣置　間，用火熏之，日熏柑。浸以糖蜜，其味尤佳。</p>
<p>藝橘最重土質，若地味各異，雖移值佳　無益。故晏子日生淮南則爲橘，生淮北則爲枳。葉徒相似，味實不同。今言遷地不良者，每謂一過淮之橘），其義本此。</p>
<p>咏橘之什頗多佳者，葉適橘枝　云；（蜜滿房中金作皮，人家短日掛疏籬，判霜翦露裝船去，不唱楊枝唱橘枝）。蘇轍圭君惠温柑詩；（楚山黄橘彈丸小，未識洞庭三寸柑，不有風流吳越客，誰令千里送江南）。斷句如放翁；（綠苞和葉摘新橙）。鄭元佑；（橘熟黄香壓樹低）。遊文靖；（　洋西風橘柚香）。俱雋麗可愛。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>同治是清朝第八代的君主，他就是太后自已的兒子。可憐這個小皇帝委實死得太早了，他祇活了十九年，便染着很厲害的天花，不治而死。這對於太后，當然是十二分傷心的！</p>
<p>雖然同治在時間上所佔的地位是那麽的短，他對於國計民生，根本談不到有什麽貢獻；便是他的文才武略，也必然是非常有限的。可是他的遺物却眞收藏得不少，已遠出他的可憐的老子丨咸覺之上了。這也許是因爲他還是一個小孩子，什麽東西都歡喜，生前已擁有一部份很大的寳物和用品，死後便遺下這麽許多來了。或者並不是這様，而是因爲太后過於愛他的緣故，不忍使他因毫無半些政績，而給人們遺忘掉，所以格外的用心把他的遺物收抬起來，送到這些古宫中來收戲，患讓他借着這些東西的力量，博一個不朽之名。</p>
<p>到了這一間殿上，太后已轉變爲一個充滿着哀痛的情感的慈母了丨首先映入伊的眼簾的是一具方形的玻璃盒。裏面收藏着一隻純金製的小碗，式様很輕巧，雖然是金的，但看去是决不會如何笨重的；上面還　着許多精細的花紋，和吉祥的字句，這就是同治生前所用的飯碗。跟這飯碗收藏在一起的是一架銀製的小型天平秤，當年太后就用這一架秤，每天親自給同治料理食物，以免他吃得過飽或不足。</p>
<p>在另外一具較大的玻璃盒裏，我們又見到了同治當日在位時所穿的一件小小的龍袍。（一九八）</p>

<p>我國素為多妻之國，官越大妻越多，所以做了「王」「帝」，有三夫人，九嬪，二十七世婦，八十一御妻的特殊權利，至於後世，唐太宗竟有遣散宫人至三千餘人之多，因此有錢的小百姓，就三妻四妾，也並不希罕，在這種制度之下，祗有「七岀」之條，談不到離婚不離婚，但是一般女子呢？祗有敬守着「三從四德」「從一而終」的義務，所以雙方保持着絶對的權利義務，而岀妻的案件既不多見，而「下堂求去」「馬前潑水」的，也並不多見，我國號稱文明故國，但文化的進展，非常遲緩，到如今還只能算是一個半開化的國家，恐也就是離婚案件太少的縁故，</p>
<p>我國文化推進最速的時期，便是現在，而離婚案件的如「雨後春笋」，也莫如現在，因為現在的婚姻，男女絶對自由，結婚自由，則離婚也天然自由，用不着提岀民法上規定的離婚條件，以為標準，只要雙方有一些意見不合，或是雙方言語不通，明天就可去提岀離婚之訴，所以前日某離婚案，當開庭的前一夕，雙方的當事人，還「共桌而食」，「共衾而睡」，次日到庭，兩人又「相視而笑，莫逆於心」，此種離婚案件，雖是扛破離婚記錄的創作，於此也可以看岀離婚等於兒戲，原不好算一回事，所以前日有九男共姦一十五齡的女子，也不過是兒戲罷了，更試翻開報紙一看，何日没有請求離婚的案件，非但天天有，而且一天有多至數件的，我就從這離婚案件看來，我國真是文明進步了，真是國家有望了，</p>
<p>現在離婚之訴，夫方提岀的多呢？還是妻方提岀的多？我現在不來討論，總之「兒子自己的好，家主婆别人家好」，這是男子共通的心理。女子的心理，究屬怎樣？我不得而知，我可武斷一句，「從一而終」的，固然甚多，而和男子同一感想的，也未敢説絶對的没有，從前有句老話「三年不死老婆，悔氣」，又説「田舍翁多收十斛麥，尚欲易妻」，因為當時感到離婚的不容易，所以有此念頭，也往往不敢去幹，只有望老婆死，這不容易的原因，一是禮教的束縛，二是法律的束縛，所以心想離婚，到底不敢動手，這就是我國文明進化停遲的原因吧？</p>
<p>因此欲看國家社會文明進化的程度，便可看離婚案件發生的多寡，再進一步講，欲看個人文明的程度，就看其人離禍婚，和没有離過婚，故離婚的人物，便是最文明最時髦的人物，倘若擁着「黄臉老婆」以為至寶，便是「剷頭」「不岀息」的東西，若照這樣的觀察法，去觀察文明的程度，諒是十分正確的吧？所以西哲有言，民智愈開，則道德愈薄，却是不差，</p>

<p>據説今年的雜誌風行而呌做「雜誌年」，原因是在社會進步，人事日繁，對於長篇巨著的大作是没有時間來包配了，祗能在忙裏偷閑讀一點書耳。這理由相當可以信任，社會不是進步到二十四層的大厦已經巍峨地完成了嗎？而人事日繁，甚至大學生也做起扒兒手來了。所以即使日以繼夜的書獃子，恐怕也要放下書本求飯碗了。</p>

<h3 id="c238">傭女逃亡誰負責？ <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>這是兩封關於僱用僕人的責任問題的來信，因為性質相同，特一併發表岀來，參加編者一點意見，並希望各讀者加以討論。</p>
<p>（一）我於五年前，由舍親介紹小女傭一人，留家使用。嗣因該傭工作不甚稱職，曾請介紹人帶領回去。而介紹人以該女家境困苦，堅囑留用，我為顧全人道計，祗得仍行留用。一日該女聲稱有事，欲返家一行，家人當允其回去。詎料女一去不返，當即詢諸介紹人，及該家屬，則云並未到家。旋向各方招貼遍尋，亦無着落。當時邀集原介紹人集議，由我岀洋二十元，補償一切，作為了事。而最近該家屬及介紹人又舊事重提，追索該女。敝人無法應付。懇請指示，以釋憂慮為盼。　羅家雄上</p>
<p>（二）鄙友某君在今歳春間，憑中購一婢女，訂期十年。該婢於七月病起，至九月卅日病死。</p>
<p>當病時，曾疊函中保及婢方家族，囑來看探。該家族復稱川資無着，故未來。其函寄至其同鄉某甲處，而某甲將此意口告鄙友家中，</p>
<p>婢病以來，曾赴醫院掛號看十數次；西醫二次，（均無診單）中醫一次，有藥方。婢死後，鄙友未經呈報檢騐手續；即行辦棺收殮。一面函告該女家屬。詎有某甲，曾為律師，已被律師公會除名。嗾使該女家屬具告鄙友虐待致死之罪。藥方一紙，被彼方律師，借調查為由，携去隱匿。</p>
<p>兹有下列二點，請予詳答：</p>
<p>（一）因病而死，但未經家族到場，即行收殮，彼方可否根據此點，誣以傷害罪？</p>
<p>（二）某甲主使該家族以傷害罪誣告鄙友，是否有罪？　　李夢塵上</p>
<p>編者按：關於僱傭的責任問題在法律上並没有明文規定。但根據一般的習慣，似乎有一個原則可以解釋這件事。就是一個年齡已大的僕人，他有行為能力，一切行動很難時時加以約束，實際上也無法約束。所以他如有什麽越軌的舉動，做主人的當然不能負責。像僕人逃走一事，隨時有發生的可能，更屬防不勝防，假使都要主人負責，那末天下那裏還有人敢僱僕人呢？至於對待小的僕人，（譬如是十四五歳）也不過是盡一點保護的義務，並不能負完全的責任。</p>
<p>編者認為假使這個僕人受了主人的吩咐，去做某一件事，譬如是件很危險的事，因為做這件事而受到什麽傷害，那末主人當然要負責，除此以外，如遇到什麽病，死，逃亡等事發生，主人是不能負責的。</p>
<p>像羅君的小女傭無故逃走，除了主人有什麽無理虐待的情事外，羅君當然不能負絶對的責任，因為此人雖小，但總有離開主人的時候，購物，岀外都是逃走的機會，主人怎能隨時去管束她呢？人既然逃走了，羅君的責任不過是帮助找尋吧了。岀錢了事雖是體念别人失女之痛，但實在是一種錯誤。也許岀錢倍償，就是引起他們藉故要挾詐取金錢的原因。現在她的家屬，如再向羅君吵閙要人，那末為了將來的安甯起見，只有用法律解决的一法，假使再用錢賠人，我們想那些人見你好欺，一定要常常來麻煩你的。</p>
<p>關於李君這方面，他的女僕因痛而死，他當然不負責任。並且他曾預先通知家屬，在醫院掛號十餘次，經中西醫之診治，均可證明是病故而非虐待傷害而亡。某甲要嗾家屬告虐待致死之罪，李君儘可和他對質公堂。藥單雖被他騙去一紙，但醫院及中西醫生都可證明你是無罪的。最後到了不得已的時候，還可開棺檢騐是否有傷。他們有意誣告，當然有罪，此事李君理由和證據都很充足，似乎不成什麽問題。</p>
<p>關於購買婢女，訂期使用的合同，在法律上不能成立，因為一個人是不能隨便買賣的。雖然李君之事已成過去，但編者覺得還有告訴一般讀者的必要。</p>

<p>— 細流</p>
<p>甯願生命䘮失不願容顔毁損　瑪薩因此捐軀卡落不敢窺鏡</p>
<p>無論你説身段，體態手脚，在表演上佔着都麽重要的地位，但是面容，還是電影明星，尤是是一般女明星們，所最重視的一部份。她們惟恐有一天，她們的面容損壞了。她們的電影生活，亦就完了。她們甯可死，却不願意她們的面容損壞。因此，她們在危急萬分的時候，她們會雙手捧住了臉，而不顧她們的身上的。這是她們下意識的舉動，由於平日太重視了她們的面部之所致。幾年以前，有一位很有名的女明星，瑪薩曼斯斐（Marth　Manstield）。她正從攝影塲拍完了影戲回家。她身上還穿着一身戲裝，極薄極薄的紗製成的。等到她坐上了自己的汽車，她倦極了。她劃了一支火柴，點了一支香烟，閉着眼睛，吸着烟，很舒閑地休息着。忽然她的衣服燒起來了。瑪薩驚醒了。她看見了火，連忙將兩隻手捧住她的臉。車夫立即將車煞住，奔向後座，嘴裏運聲喊着：「你快拿手撲滅那火燄」！那火燄本來可以一撲就滅的，但是瑪薩始終不肯將她的手離開她的臉。她被燒得遍體鱗傷，以致不救而死了，但是等到她裝到棺材裏的時候，他的面容仍舊是鮮艷如生。為面容而䘮生，這是大家所深為慨惜的。</p>
<p>没有多少年以前，卡洛兒郎白的汽車岀了事，她的面部受了極重的傷。她請了幾位有名的外科專家，替她縫治面部，但是他們都不敢擔保她的面部能够恢復原狀。卡洛爾聽了這個話，她在精神上所受的痛苦，可以説是百倍於她面部所受的痛苦，因為她是情願玉碎，而不願意瓦全的。她有多少時候，不肯照鏡子，恐怕看了吃不住那種一切生命事業完全破碎的痛苦。她不敢看那不可避免的現實。後來醫治了許久，她臉上的綳帶取掉了。醫生告訴她，她的臉居然平復如初了，她還疑心醫生們在安慰她。她忐忐忑忑地去拿鏡子。等到她看見了自己的面容，果然是一些没有損壞，她才覺得生命的有意義。她現在臉上還有一些微細的痕迹，但是有人説，那細微的痕迹，反增加了她的美，而卡洛兒的名氣，亦就此十倍於前了。但是，我們要曉得像卡洛兒郎白的事件，是一千萬人之中，没有第二個這樣幸運的。除此之外，和以上事件相近的，就是阿麗絲弗斯貝的汽車岀險。她竟没有損壞她的面容。當時她因為生命保全了，中心感謝萬份。所以也没有想到她面容的有損傷没有。不過現在她重回到攝影塲上，她每天都感謝上蒼，給她那種特殊的恩遇。她左眼皮上面，還留着一個小疤，那就是紀念品。但是那個小疤却益增其嫵媚了。</p>
<p>許多明星肯騎劣馬，開汽車開足馬力，打馬球，駕駛飛機，打獵，爬山，做各種危險的游戲，並不害怕，但是等到她們，或他們，的臉上，生了一個小泡，那就不得了啦。要是一個女明星腿跌斷了，她或者祗請一×位醫生醫治，但是臉上碰碎了一層皮，她或者要請兩位醫生，外加一位皮膚專家。你亦不能怪她們，因為她們的事業生命，却全靠她們的面容也。所以梅蕙絲遇見了强盗的時候，那個强盗拿手槍對準了她的臉，呌她拿首飾褪下來。梅不慌不忙地説道：「喂，朋友，首飾儘管拿去，但是不要拿槍對着我的臉。首飾你拿去了；我還可以再買，但是還有臉，那兒來的錢呢？」我們當然很佩服梅蕙絲的膽量，敢在强盗先生的面前侃侃而談，但是强盗們知道了她的心理，所以他們第二次的恐嚇，就是：「你敢到法庭作證，指明我是搶你東西的人，你小心些！我會拿硝强水澆在你的臉上的。」梅蕙絲不怕，她仍舊到法庭去作證。她不是不寶貴她的面容，她實在不肯受强盗的恫嚇。</p>

<h3 id="c244">評「孽債」 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 石斧</p>
<p>Of　Human　Bondage</p>
<p>—大上海映</p>
<p>這世界上的女人，只可以用三種東西來買，金錢，享樂，和青春。那以情絲自縛，纒綿悱惻，自以為是天生情種，實在都不過是呌人看了可憐可氣的大儍瓜而已。</p>
<p>故事是説這樣的一個大儍瓜：片面的單戀一個具有流動性的女郎，在旁人都以為「不是好姻縁，」但是他本人幾乎要拚命的去愛她，第一次她嫁了别人，被遺棄了，她又回到他懷裏來。第二次她和他的好朋友勾搭上了，和他藉故吵閙，把他心愛的名畫書本都毁壞了，又氣得他發昏，第三次的離開他，她却祗有墮落的路了。</p>
<p>這儍瓜始終牽絲絆籐，念念不忘的戀着她，雖有能温存體貼他的人，給他以精神上的慰藉，可是總敵不過那妖蕩浪漫的壞女人，這樣事態的變遷結果，當然是這女人潦倒以終，而儍瓜亦竟有「皇天不負好心人」的收穫。終於娶得了一個賢淑的夫人。</p>
<p>這劇的劇本確是好的，所以導演也易於見長，給予我們的印象，也相當的深刻。最足以啟示我們的是為什麽李士利好華特，情有所獨鍾的一定要去愛那樣一個除去「肉」以外，一無所有，而且討厭的女人，真是别有會心了。這可以見到每個地方。每個時代都有這一種的「變態愛」，也正是所謂「苦海」，「地獄」的現象。不過我們是「旁觀者淸」，所以有這種直覺罷了。我們在這裏所覺得的無所謂「情」，祗有「孽」，題名呌「孽債」却是很對的。</p>
<p>在舖叙這故事的攝影方面，很見到導演的技能，脚色的支配，也並不草率從事，在三個不同女性的表演上，給觀衆以相當的滿意，除李士利而外兩個不同樣的女性玩弄者，也很得其人。一齣戲的佳否，我們不僅是看主角，對於配角的側重，我以為也是比較重要的。</p>
<h3 id="c245">評「醒圓好夢」 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Ｗake　up　and　Drean</p>
<p>在號稱黄金之邦的美國也隨着經濟恐慌，大閙失業問題的時期中，電影及歌舞業表面上雖然顯着畸形的所謂繁榮，可是實際上女明星，大歌唱家之流，遭受着失業恐慌的慘刦，也是在所不免的。</p>
<p>這「醒圓好夢」，就是相當地描寫了這些身懷絶技，而換不到麵包來生活的藝術家們的遭遇。</p>
<p>卡利是一個歌舞劇團的主持人，擁有歌唱　史谷梯與女明星陶貝兩人做台柱，可是營業淸淡不够生活。在多方找尋岀路中，得到了一通電報，拆閲之下，才知道人家是要聘請另一著名歌星西勃羅。卡利便假稱西勃羅不願受聘，推薦史谷梯與陶貝以代替。由於史與陶的藝才的試演，好容易總算被聘任了。可是岀乎意外的，那位成名的歌星突然應約而來了。卡利冒充招待員把他灌醉了酒，藏入僻室。結果事發被控，祗得在警察的緝捕中，三個人逃亡到紐約去。</p>
<p>在繁華熱閙的紐約，他們走遍了大小戲院與攝影塲，竟没有用最低的代價來聘他們的。祗得作人家的活動廣告，並且要做在極高的建築中的電線上走過的臨時演員，拚着性命來換少數的麵包。</p>
<p>這些，描寫在如此社會中的藝術家的遭受，是相當深刻的。其中還接觸到為了生活而不得已地犯下了欺詐的罪惡，以及後來那位舞台主人因愛他們的才藝來追訪，反當作警署的緝拿而逃避的誤會。</p>
<p>接着是史谷梯在公庽裏遇到當時的舞台鉅子，他的老友齊林尼，回到好萊塢去。史谷梯由小咖啡莊職員，為某影片公司聘了去，才得展其絶藝，一舉成名。自然戀愛的故事，製作者是不肯免俗地摒除的，這兒由求生活的描寫上，轉入了三角式的戀愛把戲，在功成名就的慶祝宴會上，完成了名譽，黄金與美人之夢的實現。也就是把較有意義的現實的故事，斷送在庸俗的粉飾的結論中去了。</p>
<p>故事的另一缺點是關聯到的人物太多。導演Kart　Neumaph抓不住劇中人的性格，全片處理得不太高明。前三分之一的部分中，叙述卡利等的失業買充，幽禁西勃羅，事發逃亡，以及在紐約的苦况等，還簡潔明快，中間部分簡直零亂與糢糊得使主要演員没有戲做，直到後來才讓他們有閙戀愛的較充分的表演。</p>
<p>主要的演員如羅斯柯佈布，勞其潑拉西與裘恩娜愛德等，雖是演來很賣力，可是除了三次歌唱的試演外，並没有做到應有的成功。</p>
<p>光線較暗，固然可以象徵他們一部分的暗淡生活，可是全片如此，就反而减少力量了。</p>

<p>程步高自從導演「到西北去」後，已經有好久没有看見他的新作了！有的，只是在女兒經中導演了那麽一段，但也給了無數的觀衆一個深刻的印像了。</p>
<p>「夜來香」是他自編的劇本，為了更佳美起見，他曾經費了幾閲月不眠的夜裏，才將這部作品很慎重地編好，而已於日前順利的開拍了。</p>
<p>主演有胡蝶，趙丹，孫敏，舒繡雯等，他們都被觀衆譽為最有表演天才的演員，當然，這次在程步高導演領導之下，成績當更美妙了。</p>
<p>「落花時節」是吴村繼「重婚」後一部自編自導的新作。「重婚」是有着意外的成功，那麽落花時節是要更進一步，更美滿，更可觀了。</p>
<p>主演有徐來，龔稼農，趙丹等，這幾位都是銀壇宿將。預祝他們替黑暗的電影圏放一異樣的光芒。（却）</p>

<p>— 西溟</p>
<p>這個時候，葛羅恩宫殿式的底邸，已經變成了一個下級的古玩舖，到處都堆滿了傢具，還並不是什麽好東西。很古怪的，這一般大人先生們，理當會疑心到葛羅恩的口味的，但是可惜他們總覺得葛羅恩是不會錯的，所以也就不去根究了。一回兒，拍賣要開始了，大家都笑語歡騰，看那情形，好像葛維恩家今天已到了窮途末日，大家都額手相慶似的。史博德先拍賣一隻木櫃。他信口開河地説着那木櫃的種種好處。結果那木櫃竟賣到三百七十五塊錢。史博德竭力忍住了笑。他看見過第二街的儍瓜，也看見過老百匯的儍瓜，但是第五街的儍瓜，却是滋味最好，因為那隻木櫃的原價，不過三十五塊，那原賣主還在等着要錢哩。這個利息，不是太好賺了嗎？巴巴拉聽了幾十，幾百，幾千的金錢，像流水似的傾注進來，起初亦為之眉飛色舞，不過後來她又不覺害怕起來——那些濶人，將破舊傢具搬到家裏去了之後，將怎麽樣呢。如果有一位專家，略為加以注意一下，那末，史博德，再會吧！她一面想着，一面點着支票，那都是一個一個大人先生的簽字，她手裏好像拿着一家闊銀行的簽字樣本簿一樣。她望外張着，又看見密麗蓀正站在史博德的身旁，靜聽着史博滔滔不絶的稱讀着每一件拍賣的東西。她不覺摇了摇頭。她知道密麗蓀不是好東西，如同她知道密麗蓀金黄色的頭髮，是顔色染的一樣。她知道史博德一定要上密麗蓀的當的。但是她却覺得愛莫能助。她亦不能告訴他。就是告訴了他，他亦一定不會相信的。</p>
<p>無疑的，今天的拍賣，是一個岀乎意料心外的成功，祗看見那一般紳士夫人等，靜聽着史博德的大吹大擂，却聽得滋滋有味，毫無遍疑地搶着買。一回兒，史博德得了一些空，跳到巴巴拉的身旁，吩咐他道：「呌孟克立即到銀行裏，去兑些現疑來。呌他馬上回來。那些供給傢具古董的，還等着要錢哩。」不差的，那些人還在旁邊一間屋子裏等着哩。他們都是史博德的同黨，都是吃拍賣飯的，但是他們不大相信，一定要待着現錢，才肯走哩。巴巴拉取了一捲支票，交給了孟克。孟克那時已經喝了許多酒。他接了支票，立即跑到銀行裏，將支票兑了現疑。他取了現疑回來了，但是他先要尋一個地方安放那些現疑，等有機會再交給史博德。他跑到樓上，在一間小房間裏，看見了一隻小木箱。他就將一大捲的鈔票，放在木箱裏，并且鎖好了。他又將小房間鎖好了。然後去找了一張牀睡着了。在這個時候，史博德已經中了拍賣狂，遇見東西就賣。他跑到孟克睡覺的房間，將醉眼惺忪的孟克趕開了，就拿傢具舉起來拍賣。他拿牀，桌子，椅子，都賣掉了。他忽然看見了那個小房間，就想去開，但是門是鎖好的。他不覺驚喜道：「吓，門鎖着，裏面必定有好東西。我還可以賣一下。」他説着，就硬將那扇門攻破了。他看見裏面有一隻小木箱。他就將它拖了岀來。他亦不知道裏面藏着一天收入的大部份，他就舉起來將它拍賣。但是那只箱子，不像值錢的東西。任你怎樣法螺吹破，買主却並不起勁。史博德原來想賣它——連裏面的東西——一百塊錢的。他知道裏面一定是空的，是傢具店裏鎖錯了的。（未完）</p>

Regarding local administrative and economic facilities, the local governments should consider the actual situation, formulate plans, prepare budgets, and submit them to the central government for approval and implementation, according to performance evaluations. d.

<h3 id="e4">Review Report of the Constitution Draft Committee <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The review report of the Constitution Draft Review Committee of the Fifth Plenary Session was submitted for discussion and approval at the second meeting on the morning of the 12th. The original text of the report is recorded as follows: The case of submitting the draft Constitution of the Republic of China sent by the Legislative Yuan for review was followed on December 11th from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM. The review committee members present included Chen Zhaoying, Lin Sen, Ma Chaojun, Yang Jie, Deng Jiayan, Zhan Jusi, Li Renren, Tang Shengzhi, Ding Weifen, Zhang Ji, Zhu Peide, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Shi Ying, Qin Zhen, Cheng Tianfang, Wang Faqin, Kexing'e, Zhang Zhiben, Jiao Yitang, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Jing Hengyi, Chen Guofu, Huang Shaoxiong, Liang Hancao, Sun Ke, Song Ziwen, Zhang Qun, Luo Jialun, Shao Lizi, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Zhaoming, Tang Youren, Ju Zheng, Gan Naiguang, He Yingqin, and Deng Qingyang, totaling thirty-eight people. Legislative members Fu Bingchang, Lin Bin, and Tao Luqian also attended the meeting. The four items of the constitution chapter case review procedure were decided as follows: (1) The draft constitution will be sent to the Standing Committee to form a constitution draft review committee. This committee will meet at least once a week and will invite legislators and experts to attend for consultation. (2) Two months before the Fifth National Congress, the revised opinions will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for revision. (3) After the Legislative Yuan revises the draft, it will be submitted to the Standing Committee for review and submitted to the Fifth National Congress. (4) After the Fifth National Congress passes the draft, it will be used as the Party's decision on the draft constitution and submitted to the National Congress in accordance with the law. As for the content of the draft, the members expressed many opinions. However, this matter is of great importance. Since the Standing Committee already has the organization of the review committee, it should be left for a long discussion. It cannot be decided in a short period of time. However, since many central executive and supervisory members are present at this plenary session, their opinions should be solicited in detail for the reference of the future review committee. It is generally agreed that the congress should have a detailed discussion on this draft once. It is appropriate to discuss it chapter by chapter. Special attention should be paid to the important issues in each chapter, such as (1) Whether the words "Three Principles of the People" in Article 1 of Chapter 1 should be clearly stipulated in this draft. (2) Whether Article 4, on territory, should adopt an enumeration provision. (3) Whether Chapter 2, on the rights of the people, should adopt the principle of constitutional resolution and guarantee, and the people's freedom should still be subject to legal restrictions. (4) Chapter 3, on the issues of the generation of representatives of the National Assembly, the term of office, the session period, and the organization. (5) Section 1 of Chapter 4, on the provisions of the president. (6) The relationship and balance of the five Yuan. (7) Chapters 5 and 6, on the provisions of provinces and counties. (8) Chapter 11, on the provisions of the military. (9) Chapter 12, on the body for interpreting the constitution. It is proposed that all members write down their opinions within one month and send them to the Standing Committee for submission to the future Constitution Draft Review Committee. Is this appropriate? The convener, Lin Sen, has reported to the congress for a public decision. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since Director Chiang had a diseased tooth extracted at the end of last month, he has been recovering well. It was originally scheduled that magnetic teeth could be inlaid a week later. However, during the opening of the Plenary Session in recent days, many important officials from various places came to Beijing to request an audience, which was quite laborious, resulting in slight swelling and pain in the gum board of the diseased tooth that was extracted by Xu. He was unable to attend the Plenary Session for the past two days. It is reported that he is gradually recovering and will attend the congress in the next few days. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Committee has prepared a report on important undertakings such as highways, water conservancy, agriculture, cotton, silk, and hygiene that have been handled since its establishment, and submitted it to the Fifth Plenary Session.

<h3 id="e7">Chiang and Wang's Telegram Expresses Intention to Protect Freedom of Speech <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Press in Peiping and Tientsin requests adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>—Telegram to the Fifth Plenary Session—</p>
<p>(Peiping) The press in Peiping and Tientsin telegraphed the Fifth Plenary Session on the 10th, stating briefly: "Having read the telegrams from Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang, that the government must protect and not prevent speech that does not have force or riot as a background, we see the respect of the two gentlemen for public opinion and the opening of speech throughout the country. After years of hesitation, at the beginning of this Fifth Plenary Session, we sincerely and earnestly appeal to the congress to adopt and implement the proposals of the two gentlemen. Furthermore, under this principle, in order to make the government's protection of speech effective, we would like to respectfully present two matters: (1) Even if the newly established inspections cannot be immediately abolished, the inspection agencies in various places should uniformly abide by the standards promulgated by the central government and implement them prudently. Any agency shall not arbitrarily delete or deduct those that do not hinder military affairs, diplomacy, local security, and social customs. In recent years, newspapers in various places have been banned from publishing, often exceeding the standards, and even the interests of an agency or a private individual can be entrusted to ban publication. Furthermore, or the same news, this one is prohibited, that one is allowed. All these kinds of things not only do not benefit the country in any way, but also make unscrupulous officials able to use this to block their vision. If they are not corrected immediately, the harm will be great. (2) The punishment of news organizations or those engaged in the news industry must be in accordance with the law in the future. Those that do not have force or riot as a background, even if the speech records are occasionally flawed, but since there are publication laws and ordinary criminal laws that can be used to sanction them, there is no need to resort to extraordinary means. Moreover, the Central Committee has repeatedly emphasized the safety of reporters, so that all news organizations and those engaged in the news industry should be under the control of the law, so that they dare not violate the law to seek exemption, nor will they be illegally punished. (3) All news organizations or those engaged in the news industry that have been previously shut down, detained, or otherwise punished, whether in the central government or in other regions, should be reinstated, unless they have force or riot as a background, in order to demonstrate the sincerity of the central government in protecting, being lenient, and participating in the restoration. All these two matters are in accordance with the original intention of the telegrams from Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang." (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Southern Hungarian Truce and Franco-Italian Relations - Heng <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Since the Marseilles massacre, relations between Southern Hungary have been strained and tense. In recent days, the situation has become particularly perilous, with Southern Hungary ordering the expulsion of Hungarian expatriates. Observers of international affairs generally consider this to be another thorny issue for the League of Nations. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, thanks to the mediation of representatives from Britain, France, and Italy, not only did the Southern Hungarian government voluntarily end the expulsion of Hungarian expatriates, but Hungary also unexpectedly accepted the resolution passed by the Council of the League of Nations. Since the "September 18th" Incident, this is the most successful mediation by the League of Nations in resolving a major international dispute. However, the League of Nations' achievement in resolving the Southern Hungarian dispute has its own unique reasons.</p>
<p>In short, there are approximately three key points: (1) Britain, France, and Italy, which support the League of Nations, have the power to control the relationship between Southern Hungary. (2) Britain, France, and Italy have a relatively common view of the status quo in Europe. (3) France and Italy are actively seeking a compromise. France and Italy's goal is to prevent Germany from developing externally, while Britain's goal is to stabilize the European situation so that it has the capacity to deal with any incidents outside of Europe. With these factors, all problems that could increase European disputes and hinder the rapprochement between France and Italy are issues that the three countries are willing to do their best to eliminate. There is no other way.</p>
<p>Britain's policy toward European continental affairs has been to remain uninvolved. Moreover, the Conservative Party still harbors suspicion and reservations about Russia and cannot but have some apprehension about France's alliance with Russia. Only the threat of Japanese power in the Far East and the ambiguous attitude of Germany in the West have made it impossible for Britain to coordinate appropriately with France's foreign policy. This is Britain's motive for hoping for stability in Europe. As for France, after losing Poland's assistance, it is extremely eager to forge a good relationship with Italy in order to "gain in the evening what was lost in the morning." This is very obvious. As for Italy, its attitude towards Germany has changed greatly since this summer. Previously, it had always regarded France as a formidable opponent, but now it has turned to tacit understanding. When Italy initially combined with Hungary and Austria, it intended to use this to divide France's power in Central Europe. But Germany failed to take advantage of the Franco-Italian rivalry and resolutely joined hands with Italy, causing Franco-Italian relations to become increasingly harmonious. Since France and Italy do not want to create additional problems due to the Southern Hungarian dispute, the petty squabble between Southern Hungary is naturally difficult to escalate. According to recent British and American newspapers, the conditions for a Franco-Italian compromise, in addition to naval equality in the Mediterranean, also include discussions on African colonial issues. What Mussolini hopes for are (1) the Jabes in French Tunisia, (2) the land in French Somaliland, excluding the seaport, and (3) special status for Italians in French Tunisia. Although the outcome of the negotiations, which are expected to last ten years, remains to be seen, what is clear to all observers is that relations between the two countries are drawing closer.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Wujin County Chamber of Commerce and others petitioned the Executive Yuan to increase the import tax on foreign wheat to aid domestic farmers.

Due to the extensive disaster areas this year, there is already a food shortage. Given this situation, there is no need to further increase the import tax on foreign wheat. The county chamber of commerce was notified according to this decision. (12th dispatch)</p>

Yu had a long talk with Postmaster General Hood yesterday and has now begun investigating British postal, telephone, telegraph, and aviation affairs. For the past four weeks, the inspection team has divided into several small groups to investigate railways, shipping, road construction, and other industries, with particular emphasis on cement and asphalt-paved roads. The members visited the railway administrative headquarters and material depots in London, railways and shipyards in central England, and interviewed port authorities and major shipping companies, inquiring in great detail. In general, they have begun investigating postal organization and visited the Mount Pleasant mail sorting office, where employees sort mountains of Christmas mail in an orderly manner. The guests were amazed by this. Another group visited the Rugby radio station to observe broadcasts around the world. Yu Feipeng and the team declined to compare British postal and telecommunications services with those of other countries but praised the completeness of the British organization, saying that they planned to emulate its best aspects when they returned home. The various organizations visited by the inspection team praised the team members for asking very detailed questions. Yu will remain here for two more weeks.

<p>(Tokyo) Fifty Suzuka Junzo, the boy who attempted to assassinate the elder statesman Saionji in Okitsu on the 6th of this month, was brought to Tokyo after being arrested.

<p>Charts Found on Muramoto; Awaiting US Department of Justice Decision</p>
<p>San Diego, California - San Diego is an important U.S. Navy and Marine Corps military stronghold. Today, a Japanese man was arrested with maps and various descriptions of the military port's defenses, which has aroused suspicion of espionage here. The suspect, named Muramoto, is 29 years old. He was arrested while sitting in a car parked in a dark place with all the lights off near the Rosecrans gun battery. A police patrol accidentally discovered him. After the Japanese man was taken to the police station, a notebook was found on him, filled with maps and descriptions of the military port's defenses. All the details of the naval air base, naval training, naval destroyer base, Rosecrans battery, Kearney battery, and the mooring locations of warships were recorded in detail. Muramoto can generally speak English, but he remained silent. Later, an interpreter explained that his notebook was a personal diary and that the maps he drew were designs for a garden. The interpreter further stated that Muramoto was an unemployed gardener, so the drawings were actually his ideal garden style. Police officers said that the maps were very skillfully drawn, and although they looked like a garden at first glance, a careful study revealed that the symbols used were actually a map of the San Diego area. The maps contained the styles of naval and marine personnel, indicating the fortified areas, but the translator said that these were just decorations to show the local scenery of San Diego. Muramoto has now been detained and is awaiting orders from the Department of Justice. San Diego is a naval and marine corps stronghold on the west coast of the United States, where destroyer squadrons and submarine squadrons are stationed, and there are also naval air stations, naval training ports, and naval land combat training ports. Following the recent discovery of a Japanese spy in Singapore, a similar incident has now been discovered here, which reveals one aspect of the Japanese conspiracy. (11th National dispatch)</p>

<p>Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force Work Together; Military Ports Being Greatly Expanded</p>
<p>(Washington) It was indicated here today that regardless of the outcome of the London talks, the United States is determined to spend hundreds of millions of dollars next year to strengthen its defenses in the Pacific. Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated that next year's naval plan will enable the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force to work together and extend the front line of national defense to the center of the Pacific. Secretary Swanson also said that $1.8 million would be used in next year's budget to rebuild Pearl Harbor on the island of Hawaii, making it the best military port in the Pacific. Large-scale reconstruction work has been underway there in recent months. Next year's funding will be used to continue the current plan. After the plan is completed, Pearl Harbor will be able to accommodate the entire US fleet. It was also learned that the Navy Department has been gradually accumulating gasoline in the port. Mr. Swanson further stated that naval officials are now considering sending the large airship Macon on a trial flight to Hawaii. They indicated that whether the Navy Department will build another large airship to replace the Akron, which crashed last time, will depend entirely on the success of this flight. Mr. Swanson said that if the Macon's performance is not satisfactory, he would not support building other large airships. The Macon will also participate in the naval exercises between Hawaii, Alaska, and the Puget Sound next year, and naval aircraft will play an even more important role. Since the London talks have now stalled, the exercises along the Alaskan coast next year are especially important. It is likely that during the exercises, the line from Alaska to the Hawaiian Islands will be assumed to be the defense line, and the area from the US Pacific coast to within that line will be considered the "American Inland Sea."

<p>Add 600 Aircraft Within Three Years; First 110 to be Built Within Three Months</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of War today ordered 110 light attack aircraft from the Northrop Corporation of California. These new aircraft are expected to be delivered within the first three months of next year and will be incorporated into the Air Corps in the shortest possible time to strengthen the US Air Force. The Department of War also announced a three-year plan to add 600 new aircraft. Ninety-five giant bombers have been contracted to the Martin Aircraft Plant in Baltimore. Starting next month, three aircraft will be delivered each week. Each aircraft carries 2,260 pounds of bombs and has a speed of 220 miles per hour. These military aircraft are generally twin-engine and can fly 3,000 miles on one tank, so only single-seat fighter aircraft can exceed their speed. In addition to carrying 2,260 pounds of bombs, these bombers are also equipped with three machine guns, distributed in the front, rear, and middle of the aircraft. The protection of the four airmen is very tight and comfortable. There is also protection around the machine gunners and pilots. The underside of the aircraft is equipped with a bomb bay, which is arranged in a very special way. (11th National dispatch)</p>

<p>American Delegates Prepare to Return Home, Japanese Delegates Still Awaiting Instructions</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the trends of the Anglo-American-Japanese naval talks, it is said today that several possibilities exist. According to observers, the most likely approach is for Britain to announce an adjournment, to be resumed next spring. This move could be realized by the end of this week or the beginning of next week, so that the American delegates can return home in time for Christmas. The American delegates are indeed hoping to spend the New Year at home. However, before the British Cabinet discusses this matter, the American delegates are unwilling to comment on the suspension of talks. The British delegates acknowledge that the three countries' representatives have discussed this, but state that they cannot make a firm prediction as to when the adjournment will occur or when the talks will resume. It is learned that the Japanese delegates are currently awaiting instructions from Tokyo regarding the procedures for this matter. The issue of announcing an adjournment will likely depend on the nature of the Japanese government's reply. Therefore, no adjournment announcement will be made until the Japanese delegates receive instructions from Tokyo. (Twelfth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, British Foreign Office naval expert Mr. Craig met with Mr. Atherton, Counselor of the American Embassy, to exchange views on naval issues. Mr. Craig likely informed the American Embassy Counselor of the British government's position. The Cabinet made some decisions regarding naval issues at its weekly meeting this morning, which will likely be communicated to the American and Japanese delegations soon. The important question at present is whether the naval talks will be postponed indefinitely or whether a date will be set for the resumption of talks before the adjournment. The British side seems to favor the former approach, while the American delegation favors the latter. As for the Japanese delegates, they are still awaiting instructions from Tokyo.

According to another reliable source, the British government has decided to propose that preparatory negotiations be resumed in March next year. It is learned that Japan will agree to the British proposal, while the United States will only agree if Japan proposes a new disarmament plan before the resumption of talks.

<p>(London) Through repeated meetings between Britain, Japan, and the United States during the naval preparatory talks, the Japanese delegation has completed discussions on all issues within the scope of the government's instructions. On the eleventh, a telegram was sent to the home government requesting instructions regarding the attitude to be taken in the future. The important points of its content are as follows: (1) To settle the results of all past talks, whether to restart negotiations after Japan declares the abolition of the Washington Treaty; (2) Or to continue the talks in the current state;</p>
<p>(3) Whether to proceed with more concrete matters. If the government adopts the third approach, it will be necessary to discuss the issue of maximum warship construction numbers. (Eleventh Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>

At the same time, the Japanese government will issue a statement announcing the reasons and its beliefs. (Twelfth Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During the Privy Council review committee meeting on the eleventh, the following questions were raised regarding the issue of naval arms race:</p>
<p>A Privy Council member asked: After Japan abandons the treaty, if a new treaty cannot be established, will Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States not engage in a naval arms race?</p>
<p>The government representative replied: Japan has no intention of actively engaging in a naval arms race. The United Kingdom and the United States also seem to have the same view. The government intends to repeatedly initiate necessary negotiations to achieve its goals. However, because it is difficult to guarantee that a naval arms race will absolutely not occur, sufficient countermeasures have been considered. If the United Kingdom and the United States provoke competition with Japan, Japan is prepared to respond to the competition based on its national conditions and economic situation. Japan adopts the fundamental principle of not threatening or invading other countries, and builds submarines and other warships based on the doctrine of being sufficient for defense but not enough to attack other countries. There is no need to worry about the occurrence of a naval arms race. A Privy Council member asked: What about the Pacific defense agreement after the treaty is abandoned?</p>
<p>The government representative replied: Japan hopes to retain its agreement, but if other countries do not wish to, it cannot be helped.</p>
<p>A Privy Council member asked: What if the United Kingdom and the United States request an extension of the meeting period?</p>
<p>The government representative replied: The timing of the disarmament conference is clearly stipulated in both the Washington and London treaties. The Japanese government naturally advocates holding the meeting as scheduled next year. (Twelfth Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that Japan, in principle, is willing to continue the current London naval talks and does not object to the rumored British proposal to postpone the meeting for three months. If the United Kingdom does so before the end of this week, the action will be earlier than Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Convention. (Twelfth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield delivered a speech at a banquet tonight, advocating Anglo-American cooperation. Admiral Stanley, Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Navy, and other American representatives were also invited to the banquet. Chatfield's speech briefly stated: "The United Kingdom and the United States should show the whole world that the two countries' navies are not in competition with each other but are complementary. Only the union of the British and American navies is sufficient to create a powerful tool for maintaining peace. Prominent figures on both sides of the Atlantic have declared, in word and in writing, that Anglo-American cooperation is a natural and necessary thing. American President Roosevelt, during naval exercises, delivered a speech on the cruiser Indianapolis, strongly stating that the United Kingdom and the United States must join hands to maintain peace in this turbulent world. To demonstrate this aspiration, our United Kingdom has invited the United States to send the Ocean Fleet to Britain next spring for a week-long visit. Recently, when I traveled to the United States, I had conversations with various people and deeply felt that American feelings towards the United Kingdom have gradually increased. In short, showing the whole world Anglo-American cooperation is more urgent today than ever before," and so on. (Eleventh Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) When the Senate Committee Investigating the Arms Trade reopened its hearings today, it discovered that in 1922, the Heng Hsin Yanghang (i.e., DuPont Company) had agreed with the Army Department to sell 160,000 rounds of ammunition in the Army's possession to Japan. There is a letter in the Heng Hsin Yanghang's files stating that although selling Army ammunition to foreigners is not an appropriate procedure, it does not violate Army regulations, etc. Heng Hsin Yanghang officials stated that since the Army Department knew that Japan could purchase such munitions from the United Kingdom, it was happy to assist American manufacturers. The Investigating Committee also found a letter from the Heng Hsin Yanghang in 1932 stating that American merchants selling military supplies to the Japanese Navy Department was considered not only permissible but also feasible, as the Navy Department was very willing to know the quantity and nature of munitions purchased by Japan. If Japan procured them in Europe, such information would be impossible to know. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome The French Senator's Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman, Berenger, led a delegation to participate in the unveiling ceremony of the bust of the 19th-century French writer Chateaubriand a few days ago. During the delegation's stay in Kyoto, diplomatic negotiations between Italy and France have not been interrupted. As a result, the rapprochement between the two countries seems to have made significant progress. Yesterday, French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun held a long talk with Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich, while the Governor of Rome, Prince Ludovisi, received a group of French delegation members. In the evening, Berenger, Chambrun, and his representatives attended Suvich's banquet. According to Berenger's statement to this newspaper's reporter, he was very satisfied with the Italian people's hospitality, and said, "We have come here with both political and cultural purposes, which can be said to have been achieved. I can now have absolute faith to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. I dare to say that there is nothing to hinder the rapprochement between Italy and France," and so on. (Twelfth Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Budapest The possibility of the resignation of the Gömbös cabinet has been spreading since yesterday.

The party is scheduled to hold a meeting tonight to discuss the League of Nations' resolution on the Marseille case. At that time, it is expected that attention will be paid to studying the domestic political situation. If, as a result of the discussion, opinions differ, the cabinet's position will be affected. If people believe, Prime Minister Gömbös will definitely resign, but he will immediately form a new cabinet.</p>

<p>More Than Forty Buried in the Flames</p>
<p>Lansing, Michigan The Koons Hotel here, located next to the Grand River, is very luxurious and accommodates approximately two hundred guests, most of whom are members of the state legislature, as the state legislature is in session. Before dawn this morning, the hotel suddenly caught fire, and the entire building was reduced to ashes. It has been ascertained that approximately one hundred guests escaped. About forty people died, including five legislators. The rest are missing, so the exact number of deaths will not be known until the rubble is dug up tomorrow. When the fire was raging, many guests jumped into the river, some of whom drowned, while others, wearing only their nightclothes, braved the cold and sought refuge in the snow-covered streets. As for those who fell from the building and were injured, there were also many. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lansing The number of deaths caused by the Koons Hotel fire cannot be ascertained, but it is now known that fourteen people have died, seventy are missing, and twenty-nine are injured. When the fire was raging, some people took refuge on the roof, but unexpectedly the roof collapsed, and all were buried in the flames. One servant repeatedly risked his life, running along the corridors and knocking on doors, waking up the sleeping guests, disregarding his own safety to ensure the safety of the guests. This servant's chivalry is truly admirable. (Twelfth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Restores Independent Operation of Companies</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany has been implementing a policy of concentrating shipping since 1930. The authorities are very dissatisfied with the results of this measure and have apparently decided to abandon it and restore independent operation. According to Senator Albert Esbjerg, a leading figure in German shipping, today, the joint operation agreement made by the North German Lloyd and Hapag-Lloyd in 1930, which was to last for fifty years, will be submitted to the government for approval to be abolished and stipulated that Hapag-Lloyd operate: (1) the North Pacific; (2) East Asia and Australia; and (3) Central and South America and the American West Coast lines. North German Lloyd will operate the North Atlantic and Pacific lines. The remaining smaller companies affected by the concentration policy can now all operate independently again. According to Esbjerg's statement today, the concentration policy has not been profitable. The total German tonnage has decreased from 4.2 million tons to 3.4 million tons. The government should still subsidize shipping to compensate for the losses caused by currency fluctuations. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Arrested Railway Workers Tortured; Soviet Russia Strongly Protests to the Puppet Regime <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Whipping and Other Inhumane Acts Used</p>
<p>Leading to Crippling or Death</p>
<p>Demanding the Right to Retain Compensation</p>
<p>Blagoveshchensk, Early August of this year, the Soviet Consul-General in Harbin repeatedly lodged written and oral protests with the Manchurian government regarding the arbitrary arrest and abuse of Soviet citizens and the torture of arrested employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The "Manchurian Authorities" either ignored these protests or issued general statements (when absolutely necessary), justifying their actions, claiming that the accused had committed serious crimes, and that details would be announced after a preliminary investigation. They also claimed that prisoners were treated normally and not subjected to severe torture.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the world press exposed the "Manchurian" side's abuse of Soviet expatriates, forcing the "Manchurian government" to formally respond to the Soviet Consul-General's protest. On November 6, Shi Lüben, the "Manchurian" special envoy in Harbin, issued a statement that was worded unusually, unlike typical diplomatic documents. Shi forcefully asserted the legality of the "Manchurian" side's actions, stating only that the crimes of the prisoners were "extremely serious in nature and involved a wide range of issues," with "the central issue being the Chinese Eastern Railway." However, he never mentioned the specific crimes committed. Shi denied the use of torture, claiming that the treatment of prisoners "did not exceed normal standards."</p>
<p>On November 26, the Acting Soviet Consul-General in Harbin, Levide, replied that Shi's statement did not satisfactorily address the Soviet Consul-General's requests. Levide stated that Shi's letter did not provide clear answers to specific facts regarding several illegal arrests and violations. Moreover, he did not mention what kind of punishment should be meted out for these illegal actions. The letter only contained general statements expressing the "Manchurian" side's efforts to avoid answering three important key questions regarding the case. Levide reiterated his repeated requests to be informed of the location of the arrested personnel and whether these cases were being tried in court or investigated by administrative authorities, adding that the "Manchurian" side had ignored such requests, and that Shi's statement on November 6 did not address these issues. Shi did not provide a specific answer to the question of what crimes the arrested Soviet citizens had committed, stating only that "the crimes of the prisoners are extremely serious in nature and involve a wide range of issues, and they have been committed more than once." He provided no reasons for this. Such a statement without basis or reason cannot be considered an explanation of the "Manchurian" side's actions. Logically, if the reasons for the arrests were exceptionally serious and the preliminary investigation had lasted two and a half to three months, at least the specific articles and clauses of the criminal law violated should have been ascertained. Therefore, a general statement about the "seriousness of the crimes committed" by 150 Soviet citizens cannot be considered satisfactory. Levide further pointed out that some "Manchurian" authorities were attempting to fabricate charges against Soviet employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. These false accusations were absurd and had never been proven because they had not committed any crimes.</p>
<p>Levide recalled his repeated protests regarding the severe torture of prisoners and reiterated several new facts, stating, "On September 4, Your Excellency received physical examination certificates regarding prisoners Golovina and Grigoriev, who had been tortured by the Harbin Military Police. On September 14, Vice-Consul Trepinsky showed you the bloodstained underwear of Soviet citizen Ger伏德夫, who was arrested by railway police. His underwear was given to his family by the police. On October 3, the same Vice-Consul informed you that Soviet citizens Baselin and Bu洛維克 had been severely tortured and crippled. On October 13, he again informed you of the cruel torture suffered by Soviet citizen Osaduk. On the 15th, he informed you that Osaduk had died from excessive torture. On October 19, he again informed you that another person, Gulbaseki, had died from severe torture by border guards in Manzhouli. I have repeatedly discussed with you the fate of Soviet citizens Kislov and Panshkin and informed you of the shocking news in this case. According to reliable reports I have received, these two men also died from injuries inflicted by border police officers. Although the authorities have made unintelligent statements about this, it is only to cover up these crimes. At the same time, the authorities' strict refusal to allow representatives of the Consul-General to meet with the prisoners is sufficient to prove that torture is indeed a fact, and that the authorities are concealing these actions from the Consul-General's office. What is mentioned above does not fully describe the news of the severe torture suffered by Soviet citizens in Harbin, Suifenhe, and other places (these events are the subject of my repeated protests). Your Excellency should provide a specific answer to this and explain what measures have been taken to severely punish these criminals to prevent such incidents from recurring. However, you have not mentioned these facts at all, stating only that the authorities did not use severe torture during the interrogation. This answer only indicates that the Manchurian leaders and political organs are clearly attempting to use the authority of their highest authorities to shield police officers and military police from illegal acts of violence against Soviet people, and to give the impression that the government is encouraging these actions and not punishing them. Therefore, the highest government organs of 'Manchuria' should bear full responsibility to the Soviet government for the aforementioned acts of torture and illegality. Therefore, in my capacity as a representative of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, I dare to inform you that Your Excellency's response on November 6 to the points I applied for and protested is completely unsatisfactory. I now confirm my previous protests to the 'Manchurian' side regarding the illegal arrest and torture of Soviet citizens, and again firmly demand that all previously illegally arrested Soviet citizens be released immediately, that the torture of them be completely stopped, and that those who use torture be severely punished. Finally, I hold the 'Manchurian government' organs responsible for all the losses suffered by Soviet citizens as a result of the actions of these police officers and military police, both moral and material, and I reserve the right to demand compensation for the losses suffered by each Soviet citizen due to illegal arrest and torture, as well as for the losses of Soviet citizens Kislov,劳什金, Gulbazki, and Osaduk, who died in Manchurian prisons due to torture," etc. (TASS dispatch, 12th)</p>

The sentences have already been carried out. The court stated that new developments arose during the trial of this case, so the remaining three will continue to be investigated.

<p>Gathering Comrades to Form a New Party</p>
<p>Internal Shakeup in the Seiyukai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Speaker Akita, who decided to form a new party, officially submitted his request to leave the Seiyukai to President Suzuki this afternoon at 1:00 PM. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Speaker Akita of the House of Representatives, who left the Seiyukai, immediately issued a statement that he resigned from the Seiyukai today and also took steps to resign as Speaker of the House, but will not resign as a member of the House of Representatives. As for the reason for leaving the Seiyukai, he wants to place himself in a free environment from now on, focus on study and self-cultivation, and serve the country. He wants to liquidate all past political relationships and make repeated efforts for the country, that is, to strive for the purification and advancement of the political world in view of the current domestic and foreign political situation. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Speaker Akita of the House of Representatives, who decided to form a new party, first left the Seiyukai and then started to take action. Akita's plan is to gather like-minded people from the Tokonami faction members, the Minseito Party, the Kokumin Domei, etc., and move towards the formation of a new political party for organizing the government. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Minseito Party has no direct relationship with the formation of the new party, some secretaries and Minister of Railways Uchida have some understanding, and there is a political alliance, so the future is worthy of attention. Most of the executives will form a new party centered on Tokonami, with most of the First Control Room, the Kokumin Domei, and members of the Tokonami faction in the Seiyukai. Also, Minister of Finance Takahashi will be recommended as the party leader. If Minister of Finance Takahashi declines to take office, it will be Tokonami's turn, and the new party and the Minseito Party will form a friendly party relationship. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The signs of internal strife in the Seiyukai are becoming more and more obvious. Director-General Noda submitted his resignation to President Suzuki on the 11th, following Kato, Higashiu等诸氏, thus the situation has become serious. The Seiyukai will hold a general affairs meeting tonight to discuss countermeasures. The executives will try to retain him, but it is difficult to clean up the general trend that is in a state of chaos for a while. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The decomposition of the Seiyukai is becoming more and more pronounced due to Speaker Akita's departure. It is said that the premise of the establishment of this new party is that Minister of Finance Takahashi will be the president. However, Minister of Finance Takahashi denied this rumor, saying at dusk, "This rumor is really boring, I absolutely deny that there is such a fact." (Nichi Ren dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Speaker of the House of Representatives Akita's resignation as Speaker and departure from the Seiyukai has given the political world a great shock. Akita is known for his stability and will not take action unless he is confident. Therefore, this departure from the Seiyukai seems to have considerable confidence and determination. His future actions are attracting the attention of various parties. Because of his departure, the decomposition of political parties will also occur, so in the field of politics, it may become a gene for change. It is said that former Minister of Railways Mitsuchi, Maeda Yonezo, Yamamoto Jotaro, Noda Shunsaku, and other former Seiyukai executives are also leaving the party. Moreover, cabinet members from the Seiyukai are also using various publicity methods for the movement to establish a new party. Therefore, Akita's departure today cannot be said to be unrelated. How it will proceed from now on is attracting the attention of many people. (Nichi Ren dispatch, 12th)</p>

Under-Secretary of State for India Butler declared that the principles applied to India would also be applied to Burma, and described the Burmese constitution as a responsible government system with certain guarantees and reservations. Conservative Party member Sir Croft then attacked the government's general policy, saying that a small part of the Indian people with political ideas are either firmly opposed to or actually dissatisfied with the government's proposed reforms. Croft urged the government to abandon the reform plan, saying that recent elections have proven the constituency's opposition to reform. Liberal Party member Wyatt and Conservative Party member Percy both issued warnings against a vacillating policy, saying that while the recommendations of the Indian Joint Committee inevitably contain dangers, abandoning them is not only dangerous, but will inevitably lead to disaster.

<p>Vosler Henderson, Chairman of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference and the recent recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, gave a lecture today at Vosler University here entitled "The Basic Conditions for Universal and Lasting Peace in the World." Henderson advocated the establishment of the United States of International Nations. Henderson first stated that if visitors from another planet landed on this earth, they would feel extremely surprised, because all countries on earth verbally praise peace, but in fact actively prepare for war. On the one hand, the starving are everywhere, while elsewhere, grain is wasted in streams. The most frustrating thing about this situation is that the countries responsible for convening the Disarmament Conference are still competing to increase armaments. Henderson therefore agreed with the proposal to organize an international police force, which should be placed under the command of the League of Nations, and said that if countries are prepared to organize a world economic association, then this organization is the first step in establishing the United States of International Nations.

<h3 id="e99">The American Economic Situation Shows Signs of Stabilization (American Correspondence) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Panic Temporarily Reduced, Businesses Gradually Recovering</p>
<p>Striving for Self-Improvement on the Eve of Disarmament</p>
<p>The central problem of the economic panic in the United States is the unemployment problem. Although there are no accurate statistics on the number of unemployed, most experts estimate that there are 11 million to 12.5 million unemployed, and about 4 million family members need to be assisted. Therefore, this is the most important problem facing the United States today. If it is properly resolved, the American economy will recover, and the capitalist organization may be re-stabilized. Therefore, in the past year and a half, this matter has been a major issue of concern to both the government and the public.</p>
<p>At the end of August, when President Roosevelt explained the "New Deal," he said, "The government is trying to adjust the national economy and establish the national principle of a country without an unemployed population. Now we must first study how to eliminate the existing unemployed population. Secondly, the wise countermeasures to be studied are to prevent unemployment from recurring."</p>
<p>These words have been said since Roosevelt took office. Now, repeating the original meaning is only a slight change in wording. In recent months, the actual number of unemployed has not only increased, but labor-capital disputes have also continued to occur. The relationships involved in the disputes are expanding more and more. The San Francisco dockworkers' strike was relatively large, and the textile workers' strike was even larger. If this continues, the entire golden world, the economic situation of the United States of America, is very worrying, because as a result of the intensification of labor-capital conflicts, no one can guarantee that accidents will not happen. Fortunately, after the textile workers' strike, the president took on the role of mediator, and a considerable solution has now been reached. There will not be a major movement in the short term.</p>
<p>However, the unemployment problem is still very large. Therefore, the 30-hour work week advocated by William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, has attracted the attention of the general public. He said, "In winter, special attention should be paid to relieving the unemployed from hunger and cold, guaranteeing them a minimum standard of living, and extending a hand to provide appropriate relief to the families of the unemployed." He believes that if the working hours of workers are shortened to five hours per week, then after the current 40-hour to 45-hour per week system is changed, 1.7 million people will immediately get jobs. Labor Secretary Perkins expressed goodwill towards this opinion, but most employers disagreed. Therefore, there may still be some small problems this winter, but on the whole, it can barely pass.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the New York Times, the overall index of business activity in the United States (assuming its normal state is 100) was 85.1 in mid-June, 78.6 in mid-August, and as low as 71.9 in mid-September. This is similar to the situation after the financial panic in April last year. Among them, the steel industry is the most serious, with actual work only 40% of that in June this year, equivalent to 20.9% of total working capacity. The textile industry has also been affected by strikes and narrow sales channels. In early September, weekly production of cotton cloth was only 75 million square yards, which was 25.6 million square yards less than the weekly average in June and July.</p>
<p>However, the purchasing power of the general public increased by more than 9 million US dollars in September compared to August, and building contracts also increased by more than 1 million US dollars. Industrial stocks also rose by 78 US dollars in mid-September, and the future and hope have increased, and a glimmer of recovery has reappeared. Because of this relationship, the government authorities are bolder, and with a considerable grasp of domestic problems, they can prepare as much as possible for foreign affairs, especially to cope with the disarmament preparatory meeting to be held in October.</p>
<p>According to what is heard here, Japan will strongly advocate the abolition of previous naval treaties and equality of armaments. The United States will never be willing to relax on this point. It believes that the foundation of peace is based on the Washington Treaty and the London Agreement. If these two treaties are abolished, it will not be easy to establish a new treaty. After the balance of power in the Pacific is broken, a world crisis will follow, and naval competition will become more intense. Therefore, the United States must make practical preparations in diplomacy and implement its peace proposals, but in fact, it has few allies. Japan is of course directly opposed to it, and the United Kingdom does not necessarily side with the United States. In politics, it also has a similar feeling to Japan. However, after the disarmament conference breaks down, naval competition is to be expected. The American manufacturing industry, which has always been centered on business, may also inevitably shift its gears to the military industry. This kind of trace cannot be seen at present, but what will happen in the future, we can imagine. (October 10, 1934, New York)</p>
<h3 id="e100">League of Nations Water Conservancy Experts Arrive in Peiping <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Investigating Water Conservancy Projects in North China</p>
<p>Leaving China in Two Months</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The League of Nations, in response to China's request to improve China's water conservancy and river works, specially selected four experts, Goode, Cousin, Nie Youfu, and Omodeo, to come to China last month. Omodeo is a water conservancy expert, and Cousin is a highway expert. Omodeo and Cousin arrived in Shanghai last week from Italy and France respectively. The next morning, Omodeo, accompanied by his assistant Satauli, Pu Deli, consultant of the National Economic Council, and Zhang Junqi, commissioner, went north and arrived in Peiping at 10:24 AM today (the 11th), and stayed at the Beijing Hotel. Cousin has scheduled to come north tomorrow (the 12th) and will transfer from Peiping to Xi'an, follow the Xilan Highway to Lanzhou, and inspect the road project. Omodeo is scheduled to take the Peiping-Baotou express train to Suiyuan at 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 12th) and transfer to Salachi County to investigate the Minsheng Canal project. Therefore, after Omodeo arrived in Peiping today (the 11th), he went to the Hua Yang Relief Association at 2:00 PM to meet with Zhang Yuanshan, the general manager, and Tader, the chief engineer, to inquire about the construction process and engineering design of the canal in detail. Omodeo's group is scheduled to stay in Suiyuan for seven days, and then come to Peiping to meet with the two experts, Nie Youfu and Goode. Nie and Goode are currently on a sea voyage and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. They are scheduled to leave for the north on the 17th and may make a short stay when passing through Peiping. They are expected to arrive in Peiping on the 21st. Nie and Goode are both water conservancy experts. After the three gather in Peiping, they will take the same train to Tianjin to inspect the Haihe project and the Yongding River fundamental treatment project. Then they will go to Xi'an to inspect the Jingwei Canal. If time permits, they will transfer to Taiyuan. When Omodeo passed through Tianjin this morning (the 11th), he originally planned to get off the train in Tianjin and go to Kaifeng to inspect the Yellow River. Later, in order to save time, he temporarily suspended the plan and waited for Nie and Goode to come north before going to Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces to inspect the Yellow River together. According to the investigation, after the three experts, Omodeo, Nie, and Goode, finish inspecting the Yellow River, they will go south to inspect the Yangtze River. The round-trip time is scheduled for two months, because the four experts sent by the League of Nations this time were originally scheduled to stay in China for three months to allow them to conduct a leisurely inspection and design. Now, for some reason, it has been changed to two months, and the inspection itinerary has to be shortened. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Mining Strife Repeatedly Occurs in Tangdong <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Majia Gou Miners Strike</p>
<p>Demanding the Abolition of the Contracting System</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: More than one hundred workers on the third street of the Kailuan Majiagou mine went on strike suddenly at 1:00 PM on the 9th of this month, just as shifts were changing. After the strike, all the striking workers held wooden sticks and wore yellow armbands with the words "Oppose Petty Contracting" written on them, forming a group similar to a picket line and active in the mining area, forcing other internal and external workers to act in unison. The second security team stationed at the mine mobilized the entire team after hearing the news and guarded inside and outside the mining area, and persuaded the workers to return to work. The workers then elected five representatives to demand: (1) that the Rui Sheng Company, the contractor, abolish the petty contracting system; (2) that workers shall no longer be oppressed in the future. After the incident, the representative of Rui Sheng Company rushed to the Tangshan Mining Bureau and requested that the mining area police be informed and armed suppression be carried out. The conditions put forward by the workers were not accepted by anyone, resulting in a serious situation in the mining area. The third street mine was completely shut down. According to the workers, the reason for the occurrence of this incident was that Rui Sheng Company, the contractor, sought huge profits and contracted part of the project to petty contractors. The ninth coal mine of the third street has been contracted, and the workers believe that layer-by-layer exploitation of rights violates the contract between the mining bureau and the workers, so they expressed their opposition. A labor dispute once occurred because of this matter last month, which was later calmed down because Rui Sheng Company, the contractor, voluntarily withdrew its proposal. Now the company has resumed the previous plan, and the workers have resisted by striking. However, according to other sources, there are currently many bandits lurking in the Majiagou mining area. Such as Communist traitors, all create trouble out of nothing and provoke labor-capital struggles. Recently, the traitor Zhao Dazhong sent Guo Lantian to Dongsi Mines, including Majiagou, to secretly organize the Second Pseudo-Strong Army, inciting workers to join, and not a few have joined. Guo's Pseudo-Second Army governs three brigades, and each brigade plans to recruit three thousand people. The firearms are transported from Tanggu by a certain foreigner. All those who prove to be loyal after joining will be issued firearms. The purpose of recruitment is entirely in the mining area workers. Therefore, the mining area has long been restless. Zhao Zhuang and Majiagou have more miners and are already under martial law. This strike by the Majiagou miners is only ostensibly to fight for the exploitation of petty contracting interests, but in reality, the background is not so simple. Zhao Xun, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, has sent the inspector general to investigate and try to quell the incident. Also, the workers of the Tangshan Qixin Cement Company have always enjoyed the best treatment and there has been no labor dispute. On the 7th of this month, they suddenly used the excuse that the company charged workers a higher price for buying cement than the contractors, and thousands of workers brewed a strike. The factory learned about it in advance and secretly reported it to the security team, which sent a large team of police to guard the company. The workers saw that the news had been leaked and did not take any action. However, starting from the morning of the 8th, they implemented a go-slow. Although the workers still arrived at the company on time, they did not work. Fortunately, the company manager was quick-witted and secretly summoned the workers' leaders to conduct open and honest persuasion, and after persuading the remaining workers, they resumed work in the afternoon of the 9th. However, the mining area police are afraid that there will still be repeated incidents and have not relaxed their guard. (10th)</p>

<p>Many Pseudo-Military Officers Captured</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In July this autumn, disaffected military personnel, including You Renxiao, were secretly active in Jinan, contacting bandits, and attempting to cause disturbance. Their agency was located in Wangguanzhuang, south of Jinan City. They used the name of Yimin Company for activities, and determined the size of the class according to the amount of stock. You Renxiao served as the commander-in-chief, Huang Ziliang as the deputy commander, and there were pseudo-third road lieutenant general Shuzhentang, first division commander Ren Buyuan, second division commander Wang Zhongting, third division commander Liu Junming, fourth division commander Liu Yanbin, fifth division commander Bu Hanzhang, first brigade commander Zhang Huchen, second brigade commander Wang Zhizhong, third brigade commander Lv Xianbin, etc. The matter was discovered by the special detective team. On July 14th, team leader Liu Yaoting led the team to Wangguanzhuang to search and captured Shuzhentang. Huang Ziliang and others were on the run. Huang's relative, Jie Guangsong, was captured. Later, the pseudo-first brigade commander Yue Dai and pseudo-military officer Hou Zhenhuan were captured in Yuanliuzhuang. The fugitive pseudo-first brigade commander Zhang Huchen went to Tai'an to carry out activities openly, contacting lurking bandits. Feng Yuxiang's guards, together with the Tai'an County Government, captured Zhang and sent him to Jinan for trial together. Chairman Han reported to Chairman Chiang by telegram, and Chiang sent a telegram praising him and ordering him to continue the search. The reactionary elements temporarily restrained themselves slightly, and the arrested pseudo-military officers were also sentenced to permanent imprisonment.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after a few months, the reactionary elements relapsed and secretly came to Jinan again, establishing an agency at No. 14 Nanshang Street, Weiyi Road, in the commercial port, still using the name of Yimin Company and using the method of issuing invoices as proxies. The person in charge was pseudo-division commander Wang Shude. After the news leaked out, the special detective team learned about it and team deputy Feng Xiuan led team members to ambush and arrest the suspects on Shangshan Street at about 1:00 AM today (the 10th). Wang Shude was captured, and Yimin Company stocks, etc. were found. According to Wang's confession, there were still Chief of Staff Fa Ziyuan and Fa's son Fa Yi (also a pseudo-military officer) who were currently residing at Tiegong Temple by Daming Lake and were also carrying out activities. The special detective team then mobilized again and captured Fa and his son. Later, Fa confessed that Wang Zhenqiu on Yongqing Street was the representative of Commander-in-Chief You Renxiao, so they continued to search and arrest him. Wang was also captured, as well as another representative, Ding Jüzheng, and Wu Huchen, the recruitment commissioner appointed by pseudo-division commander Wang Shude, were captured at Wang Zhenqiu's home. According to Wang Zhenqiu, there were several other people who had just gone out for a walk, etc. The detective team sent 1,000 criminals to the military law department. This morning, detective team members continued to capture two pseudo-military officers, Sun Chuanxiang and Kang Youtian, at the New Market, who were also their remnants. There was also a pseudo-representative named Ren Tian (from Hejian) who had just returned home, so he escaped. The newly captured criminals were sent to the military law department in the afternoon. According to their confession, the party members active in Jinan have been wiped out in one fell swoop. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Situation of Chao-Shan News Industry <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Strict News, Postal and Telegraphic Censorship</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Southwest Committee members previously issued a telegram announcing freedom of speech, abolishing the news censorship office composed of military, political, party and police personnel, and establishing a publication review committee to send personnel to guide speech. Based on this, the Shantou Journalists Association submitted a request to the Southwest Political Committee to stop various agencies from forcibly soliciting news drafts and sources from newspapers, and that original manuscripts should not be reviewed unless based on legal procedures. One month after the submission, no reply has been received, and Shantou's newspapers still have to send the original manuscripts to the censorship committee every night for stamping before they can be published. A few days ago, the New Lingdong Daily was fined to suspend publication for seven days because one news item was published without being stamped by the committee. Meixian Daily News also published a news item "Five Manifestations Temple Doing Plays", and the reporter of the newspaper was arrested by the armed forces of the training office, and was acquitted after publishing an apology. Chao'an Yongbao and New Construction Daily were severely warned by the Chao'an County Party Department for publishing Cai Fanghua's submission, claiming that the newspaper was disparaging the party's authority. Also, postal inspection is also extremely strict. News telegrams must be reviewed and stamped by the inspector before they can be sent. The inspector is not permanently stationed at the telegraph office, so news telegrams are often delayed. In the event of major news, the inspector must consult the competent officials. If the source of the news is asked, the telegrapher must be responsible for answering in detail. Therefore, the Shantou news industry is extremely hopeful that freedom of speech will be realized as soon as possible to avoid all kinds of suffering.</p>

<p>The Provincial Anti-Opium Committee, considering that the registration of opium addicts has long been closed, but opium smokers often underreport or use aliases to cover up during registration, or those who have returned from abroad have no way to apply for supplementary licenses, it is inevitable, in order to be considerate of opium addicts, it is specially accommodated, and all county anti-opium committees are ordered to allow opium addicts who have returned from abroad to apply for supplementary registration and issue licenses with the certification of the township head. Those who are not laborers but obtain type B licenses by deception are allowed to exchange them for type A licenses, those who report insufficient consumption are allowed to increase the amount, and those who use aliases are also allowed to correct them, otherwise, once found in the future, they will be severely punished according to the law, etc. The County Anti-Opium Committee has ordered the district chiefs of each district to convey the message to the township head for effective publicity.</p>

After more than an hour, it was extinguished, burning one ice pond and causing a loss of about 2,000 yuan.</p>

After strict interrogation by the headquarters, it was confirmed that the offender had repeatedly committed the crime of setting up a place to provide people with highly addictive drugs for smoking, and his crime was unforgivable. He was sentenced to death and submitted to the Nanchang Camp for approval. At about 9:00 PM the night before, the order was sent back to the county government of this county for execution.

<p>Jin Bingchun, the acting patrol officer of the Anzhen Eighth Resident Station, learned that gambling was rampant in Donghutang Town. On the day before yesterday at 1:00 PM, he personally led nine police officers to arrest them. He first went to Wang Helin's teahouse, and then to Zhou San's teahouse to search, and arrested nine gamblers. Just as he was about to take them away, many villagers and members of the 22nd Detachment of the Merchant Corps surrounded Patrol Officer Jin and the police officers, robbed the gamblers, and fired four or five shots as a demonstration. The police officers immediately fired back. For a time, gunshots crackled, as if facing a formidable enemy. As a result, a stray bullet injured the leg of police officer Su Sanshi. Later, he was rescued by the 3rd squadron of the Security Team. The shops in the town were closed one after another, and the situation expanded. Patrol Officer Jin reported the situation to the main examiner and sent the injured police officer to the city for treatment. After receiving the report, Director Chen immediately sent Inspector Wang to lead forty officers from the guard and patrol teams to go down to the countryside to suppress the situation and investigate the truth of the incident. He also persuaded the shops to open and hunted down the gamblers for legal action.</p>

<p>At about 1:00 PM on the 11th, Li Chengyuan, a traveler, arrived at the Chunxing Inn near the Wuyi Railway Station and then opened Room No. 7 to rest. Li was a salesman from the Jiading Daxing Woolen Mill. He came to Chang from Danyang on this day, carrying a large number of towels, preparing to sell them to various stores. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, a person suddenly came to the inn to visit Li, saying that the store needed to buy towels. Li accompanied him into the city, and when he arrived at the Dongshantou place inside the Land Temple in Zhongshan, another person suddenly came and blocked the way, and took out a pistol to scare him into silence. Then he used a rope to tie his hands behind his back, tightly covering his eyes with his belt. Then he robbed him of 400 yuan in cash and more than 60 yuan in cash and miscellaneous items from his body. Afterwards, Li Chengyuan rushed to the Yingchun Bridge to report to the police on duty to pursue the robbers, but the robbers had already escaped. The public security organs paid great attention to the occurrence of a robbery in the city, and searched and investigated everywhere late at night, and inquired at various hotels, but found nothing.</p>

<p>Due to the overloading of passengers, sampans in various ports of this county have repeatedly caused accidents. The county chamber of commerce, with the approval of the county government, ordered them to cease operations. However, the sampan operators in various ports, totaling over two hundred people, have faced financial difficulties and are on the brink of starvation since losing their jobs. Yesterday (the 10th), all sampan operators gathered and came to the county to petition the county party headquarters and the county government, requesting permission to resume business in order to make a living.

<p>Respectful Admiration for Telegram from Wang and Chiang</p>
<p>Two Requests Made</p>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Association and the Shanghai Journalists Association separately wired the Fifth Plenary Session yesterday, expressing admiration for the telegram from Wang and Chiang, and making two requests. The full text of the telegrams is transcribed below:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Telegram from the Newspaper Association <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>To the Presidium of the Fifth Plenary Session in Nanjing: The opening of the plenary session has brought joy to the entire nation. Having read the telegram from Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang, which enumerates five points on the path to national salvation and good governance, and the means of peaceful unification, we deeply admire and respect them as essential plans for saving the times. In particular, the item on safeguarding freedom of speech is something our association has long aspired to. We believe that in the past, when the Red bandits were rampant and the national army launched a large-scale campaign of suppression, the order of the rear should be sought for stability, and the legal freedom of speech and association of the people was inevitably restricted to some extent. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang's supervision of the suppression has been victorious, and there are no traces of bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi. The peaceful unification of the country has also been realized. It seems appropriate to lift the aforementioned provisional measures restricting freedom, in order to conform to the sincere intention of Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang to respect the freedom of the people. Now that all the members of the Central Committee are gathered in the capital to discuss national affairs, this association respectfully appeals to your council to adopt and implement the following two matters first: (1) Before the system of news censorship is abolished, we request that you issue a general order to the news censorship offices in various regions, urging them to strictly abide by the censorship standards set by the central government, handle matters with care, and avoid being overly harsh, so as to avoid discrepancies. (2) News organizations that have been punished in the past, but are not backed by force or riots, should be generously restored to their former status in order to observe their future behavior. We humbly express our sincerity and respectfully request your clear consideration. Shanghai Newspaper Association. (Printed matter)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Telegram from the Journalists Association <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>To the Presidium of the Fifth Plenary Session in Nanjing: The national telegram from Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang advocates that the people and social organizations should enjoy freedom of speech and association in accordance with the law, but if they are not backed by force or riots, the government must guarantee and not prevent them. After reading it, we are filled with admiration. We have learned that in recent years, due to the rampant Red bandits and the unstable domestic order, the government has had no choice but to impose restrictions on the legal freedom of the people. Fortunately, the bandits have been completely suppressed in Fujian and Jiangxi, and the unity of the country has been achieved. The provisional measures restricting freedom of speech can gradually be lifted, so that the people's thoughts can be freely developed, in line with the spirit of political tutelage and education. According to news from Beijing, the proposals of Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang have been adopted by your council and handed over to the Central Political Committee for implementation, which is deeply gratifying. Based on the spirit of the telegram from Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang, this association appeals to your council: (1) Before the news censorship system is abolished, it is necessary to strictly order all regions to strictly abide by the standards set by the central government and handle matters with care, avoiding being overly harsh, so as to avoid discrepancies. (2) News organizations that have been punished, if they are not definitely backed by force or riots, should be immediately restored to their former status to show leniency. We urgently hope that the above two items will be adopted and implemented first, and we cannot help but look forward to it. Shanghai Journalists Association. (Printed matter)</p>

They will be gradually realized, comforting the hopes of the people, guiding the nation on a prosperous path. We respectfully offer our sincere respects to the forum. We only hope for your consideration. The Preparatory Committee of the Special Party Department of the Kuomintang Shanghai Security Office. (Printed matter)</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haily" steamship, after entering the port at noon the day before yesterday, sailed to the Jiangnan Shipyard at Gaochangmiao and docked in the No. 3 dock. Yesterday morning, the company sent Zhao Yuntai, the head of the shipping department, to meet with the representative of the company that built the ship and the representative of the Malcolm &amp; Company representative in Shanghai to inspect the ship's machinery and various interior decorations. The inspection was completed in the afternoon, and the Jiangnan Shipyard was handed over to paint the ship.

<p>Germany Bans Remittances from Chinese Merchants</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Yesterday Requesting Negotiations <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Please Request the German Ambassador to Negotiate and Lift the Ban in Accordance with the Sino-German Treaty</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating, "To the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: On the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Yantai District Hairnet and Lace Industry Association of Fushan County, Shandong, stating that the hairnets, lace, embroidery, and other goods produced in Yantai are related to the livelihoods of the poor and foreign trade. Since they have been exported to Europe and the United States, there have never been any difficulties. Now, the German government is restricting remittances, which is unexpected. The import tax on lace, embroidery, and other goods shipped to Germany was previously levied on each kilo according to weight at 7.5 German marks. Now, it has increased to 30 German marks per kilo. Based on the value of the goods, the tax is approximately 130 marks per 100 marks worth of goods. With such a heavy tax, business has suffered a great loss. Unexpectedly, Germany is also restricting remittances. In the past few months, each person was allowed to remit about 5,000 yuan per month, which has gradually been reduced to 200 yuan. Now, it is completely prohibited. Although there are large sums of money accumulated, not a single cent can be remitted, causing Chinese merchants to be trapped and unable to move, no different from being sentenced to death. It is believed that the goods in your area that are shipped to Germany must also be suffering the same pain, and we fear that merchants across the country will be directly or indirectly affected. It is understood that trade between countries is based on the principle of mutual benefit. As for the Sino-German relationship, it has always been harmonious and should be of equal benefit. Our country allows German goods to be imported as much as possible and German merchants to remit large sums of money at their convenience. Now, Germany has suddenly restricted remittances from Chinese merchants, which is extremely unfair. If we allow them to treat us harshly at will, what can we expect for the future of foreign trade? Our association is unable to do anything on its own. We can only rely on your help to respond to each other. In addition to submitting a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we hereby request your esteemed association to verify and assist us and proceed together. Please promptly request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate in order to maintain international trade. We would be most grateful."</p>

<p>Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Bolade, the Tax Commissioner, issued a notice yesterday regarding wireless radio materials, whether in transit or re-exported, requiring a transit permit before being released. The notice, numbered 1407, read: "According to Order No. 9536 of the Ministry of Finance, wireless radio materials and equipment reported for transit should be applied for transit permits from the local telegraph bureau. However, those related to military use will be issued by the Ministry of Communications. This should be followed. Hereafter, all reports of the aforementioned items, whether for transit or re-export, will be released with a transit permit; otherwise, the goods will be detained immediately.

<p>Four French Warships</p>
<h3 id="e122">Sailed to Zhejiang Waters Yesterday for Artillery Practice <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Sail to Ningbo for Tourism Today</p>
<p>French Consul-General Telegraphed Zhejiang Provincial Government for Verification</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reported that four French warships stationed in Shanghai sailed from Shanghai to the waters off Qiliyu Island outside Zhenhai Port on the morning of the 12th (yesterday) to test their artillery. They are scheduled to sail to Ningbo for tourism on the 13th (today). The French Consul-General in Shanghai, Meili, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to inform its subordinates and the public to avoid misunderstandings. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has instructed the Zhenhai County Magistrate, Artillery Commander, Water Police, Public Security Bureau, and other agencies to verify. The original text read: "Recently, we received a telegram from French Consul-General Meili stating that the French warships CarnnrFranin, etc., will test their artillery in the waters of Zhenhai on the 12th of this month and will travel to Ningbo on the 13th. Please inform the people to avoid misunderstandings."</p>
<p>Your association should verify and provide assistance to conduct a unified process. Speedily petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiations in order to maintain international trade. We are extremely grateful. We found two items in the information sent by the association. First, the issue of high taxes on Chinese goods, according to Article 4 of the Sino-German Treaty and Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Sino-German Supplementary Treaty of 1928, the taxes on goods imported and exported by the two countries shall not be higher or different from the taxes paid by the people of this country or any other country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should investigate whether Germany taxes the same goods produced in this country or other countries at a rate as high as 130 out of 100. This will be used to prepare for negotiations. Second, the issue of banning remittances from Chinese merchants is tantamount to banning Chinese people from doing business in Germany, which is inconsistent with Article 3 of the Sino-German Treaty, which states that the people of this country have the right to engage in commerce or industry in the territory of the other country. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should telegraph the ambassador to Germany to conduct thorough negotiations and lift the ban or restore the previous system of limiting remittances to 5,000 yuan per month. Furthermore, according to Article 2 of the Sino-German Supplementary Treaty of 1928, the two contracting countries should begin negotiations on a treaty of commerce and navigation in the shortest possible time, based on the principle of complete uniformity and equal treatment. It has been nearly seven years since then, but no work has been started on this matter. As a result, when commercial issues are encountered, applying treaty text cannot achieve a comprehensive response. Please also check the old cases and quickly begin negotiations for the sake of public convenience. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Zhen.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Approval to Waive Inland Grain Tax <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Replied to Reduce Yangtze River Shipping Rates by Half</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China previously approved a telegram from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the people, stating that given the drought in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it would be better to purchase and transport stored grain from Sichuan rather than purchasing foreign rice. It also requested that the Sichuan and Zhejiang authorities be telegraphed to exempt grain from inland taxes and that all ships on the Yangtze River reduce shipping rates. The association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on September 3 to handle the matter. Replies have now been received, which are recorded separately as follows:</p>

<p>The association received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce: According to the previous telegram from the Jiangxi representative of the association, requesting that Sichuan and Hunan provinces be ordered to waive inland grain taxes, we have already ordered the finance departments of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to investigate and handle the matter and have issued instructions in each case. According to the Hubei Finance Department's report of November 19, 1934, 'We received Order No. 8386 from the Ministry of Finance, ordering us to forward to the provincial government for transmission to be followed by the county government. In addition to issuing orders to each business tax bureau to comply, we have combined the report of compliance for review.' Based on this, since the Hubei Provincial Government has ordered its subordinates to comply with the exemption of inland grain taxes, it can be smoothly implemented.

<p>At the same time, the association received a reply from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, stating, "According to your previous telegram of September 23, requesting that the authorities of Sichuan and Hunan provinces exempt inland grain taxes and order all ships on the Yangtze River to reduce shipping rates in order to resist foreign rice and circulate stored grain, this matter was transferred to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications. According to the Ministry of Communications' reply, 'We have copied the original telegram and sent it to the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association for discussion. According to the company's report, "Previously, this case was proposed by our company for discussion by various industries in Shanghai. It was proposed to collect all export grain freight rates at half price. The various industries did not agree, making it difficult to implement. We previously telegraphed your ministry and will report again after the reduction method is agreed upon. As years have passed, the opinions of the industries have not been unified, and the domestic agricultural and commercial depression is becoming more and more evident. Shipping companies believe that the import and export of goods from various places are not smooth, there are few goods, and competition is becoming more intense. In the past six months, all freight rates have been reduced without exception, especially for grain. As a result, shipping costs are increasing day by day, while freight rates are decreasing. For example, for grain, freight rates have been secretly reduced again and again. According to the current situation, they have indeed been reduced to the lowest level. The revenue from freight is only enough to cover labor costs and there is no profit to be made. If freight rates are reduced again according to the current price, not only will the opinions of the industries fail to be unified, but our company's shipping costs will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, it is difficult to comply with the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce's request to reduce freight rates on the Yangtze River. The circumstances are unavoidable, and we ask for your understanding." The Ministry of Communications also stated, "We have issued orders to each member of the Yangtze River route, and have determined to collect half of the freight charge to the regulationed price for a test period of six months." We have replied with a special note for the price of grain transportation in various ports. Please send your reference to the Ministry of Communications for review and recovery."</p>

In addition to requesting the Disaster Relief Committee to forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance for the issuance of a tax-free passport in accordance with Article 3 of the Measures for Tax-Free Disaster Relief Wheat Flour, because the disaster victims are eagerly awaiting relief, it is difficult to delay.

Once the tax-free passport is obtained, it will be sent for verification. The matter concerns disaster relief, and we hope that you will approve and implement it as soon as possible for the public's convenience."</p>

<p>Xiang He and British Merchants Sign Antimony Ore Contract</p>
<h3 id="e134">Japanese Ambassador Lodges Protest with Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Sending Orders to Suma in Beijing to Raise with the Ministry</p>
<p>British Merchants Unwilling to Express Anything</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Zhonglian News Agency in this city reported that the British firm, Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., has recently signed a contract with the Hunan Provincial Government regarding the exclusive sale of Hunan antimony ore. The Japanese side, using the excuse that the British firm is monopolizing the rights to the antimony ore, had the Japanese consul in Changsha lodge a protest with the Hunan Provincial Government Chairman on the 4th of this month, which was rejected by Chairman He. It is now reported that the Japanese Ambassador Arima suddenly lodged a formal protest with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, claiming that the contract violates the Open Door Policy and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, intending to interfere with our normal commercial activities. This is extremely absurd. The Zhonglian News Agency reporter investigated the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Protest Lodged Yesterday <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Arima sent a protest document to the resident consulate in Beijing yesterday afternoon, ordering the Japanese authorities to lodge the protest. This morning, the Japanese Embassy formally announced the contents of the protest document, stating that the British firm Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. has obtained the exclusive sales rights to Hunan antimony ore, which is tantamount to monopolizing the rights and is contrary to Articles 9 and 15 of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. Expresses <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Zhonglian News Agency reporter went to the British firm Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. on Museum Road yesterday afternoon and met with Manager Morris, asking about the firm's contract with Hunan Province for the exclusive sale of Hunan antimony ore. He replied that it was true and that it had already been signed, but he was unwilling to express anything.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Japanese Coveting Hunan Antimony <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The amount of antimony ore produced in Hunan Province is about 5 million tons per year, accounting for about 80% of the world's total production. Antimony ore is an essential raw material for modern industry, such as the manufacture of copper-iron machinery, which requires antimony ore. Therefore, the price is extremely high. During the European War, the market price was 3,000 yuan per ton. The current market price is still around 500 yuan. Because Japan has no antimony ore production, its antimony ore needs to be supplied by China. Therefore, it has been coveting the large amount of antimony produced in Hunan for a long time.</p>

The request has been formally approved by the 190th meeting of the Executive Yuan. Mr. Wen is currently the commander of the 78th Division of the National Revolutionary Army and is a paternal cousin of the former chief Wen Hongen. He was previously engaged in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and achieved repeated meritorious services, highly appreciated by the central government. This time, the central government appointed him as the chief of the Municipal Police Bureau, which will surely bring about a new policy for maintaining public order and rectifying the police administration in this city. It is learned that Mr. Wen is currently in Beijing and will arrive in Shanghai on the 13th or 14th to inspect the bureau first, and then a date will be set for the swearing-in ceremony.</p>

<p>Zhang Jinbiao from Ningbo, Han Bangjie from Shaoxing</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in early August this year, the reconnaissance team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters cracked down on a morphine manufacturing organization inside a foreigner's garden on Hongqiao Road, arrested the car driver Ge Rongrui, and seized manufacturing equipment and chemicals. The principal offender, Zhang Zongguo, also known as Zhang Jinbiao, escaped through the back door. Later, in early October, the Detective Team of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau learned that Zhang Jinbiao and others had set up a factory to manufacture morphine in the Hongkang Soap Factory at 21 Binggangli, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, and set up a Hongkang Soap Factory wholesale office at 2-6 Linping Road to secretly sell morphine. Members were dispatched with the police to arrest the morphine factory owner Zhang Jinbiao, engineer Han Bangjie, wholesale office bookkeeper Zhang Kebei, and six suspects including Shen Xiaoliang. More than one hundred pieces of manufacturing machinery, chemicals, and morphine raw materials were seized. They were successively handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for concurrent investigation. It is learned that after repeated interrogations by the Military Law Department of the Headquarters, Zhang Jinbiao and Han Bangjie were found to have jointly manufactured highly toxic drugs, and the evidence was very clear. Both were sentenced to death. Zhang Kebei was also found to have jointly sold highly toxic drugs, and he was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment with leniency. The remaining seven people, Ge Rongrui, Shen Xiaoliang, Sun Facheng, Liu Yonggen, Ye Afu, Xue Deshan, and Wang Lifu, were either car drivers or soap factory workers and were not involved in the case. They were acquitted separately. The Headquarters then reported the case and judgment to the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters for approval. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning, members were dispatched to lead a platoon of military police to escort Zhang Jinbiao and Han Bangjie to the open space next to the Longhua Airport, verify their identities, and execute them by firing squad. The announcement of the Headquarters is recorded as follows: "According to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's report on the Zhang Jinbiao et al. morphine manufacturing case, the Department ordered the Military Law Department to investigate and judge according to law. Zhang Jinbiao and Han Bangjie jointly and continuously manufactured highly toxic drugs and were sentenced to death. The case and judgment have been reported to the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters of the Chairman of the Military Commission for approval.

The Ministry of Military Affairs' reply is now available as follows: "The local famous historical sites are of great cultural significance. The Ministry of the Interior has formulated preservation regulations and distributed them to all provinces and cities for compliance. This Ministry has issued prohibitions on stationing troops in the famous scenic spots of Beijing and West Lake in Hangzhou. The Longhua Temple in Shanghai is a famous ancient temple and should be strictly prohibited according to the case.

<p>丨Gather Representatives from Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang Along the Way to Beijing丨</p>
<p>Five hundred branches of the People's Livelihood Postal Service from twelve provinces across the country will unanimously suspend business today (13th) and dispatch seven general representatives, including Yin Yuantong, to petition the five agencies of the Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and Municipal Public Security Bureau at 9:00 a.m., requesting that the termination not be enforced until the central government has decided on a plan to handle the livelihoods of more than 100,000 employees of the People's Livelihood Postal Service. They will also take the night train to Beijing at 11:00 p.m. to join more than 100 representatives from twelve provinces gathered in Beijing to appeal to Chairman Chiang and the party and government agencies such as the various yuan and departments. A reporter from the East China News Agency has investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Petition in the Morning <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications ordered all People's Livelihood Postal Services in the country to be terminated uniformly within this year, the colleagues of the People's Livelihood Postal Service in twelve provinces across the country, with the livelihoods of more than 100,000 people about to be cut off and the aftermath difficult to maintain, have successively dispatched representatives to Shanghai to gather and discuss the aftermath. After having petitioned in Beijing once, and there being no result, they have repeatedly convened representative conferences in Shanghai, deciding to suspend business for one day today across the country to hold a major petition, and dispatching the general representatives of the Shanghai People's Livelihood Postal Service, Hua Yunjin, Shao Yuantong, Wang Dashi, Zhuang Gengtang, Qiu **Sheng, Ren Shiting, and Pan Wentian, to petition the five agencies of the Municipal Government, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in the central area of the city at 9:00 a.m. today, and the Municipal Party Headquarters, Songhu Garrison Headquarters on Longhua Road, and Municipal Public Security Bureau in the city at 11:00 a.m., requesting that the termination not be enforced until the central government has decided on a plan to handle the aftermath, in order to maintain the livelihoods of more than 100,000 employees of the People's Livelihood Postal Service.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Petition to Suspend <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>A document from the entire employees of the National People's Livelihood Postal Service presented to the various yuan, departments, committees, bureaus, and Chairman Chiang reads: "The People's Livelihood Postal Service is currently requesting a postponement of the limited-time termination disposition. However, as the deadline is approaching, we first appeal for a suspension of the reported implementation before the central government has made a decision on a plan, in order to show consideration and stabilize society. The People's Livelihood Postal Service has a long history of establishment. Before the establishment of the postal service in our country, the people relied on it for transmitting letters and transporting goods. Commerce flourished because of it, and society was stable because of it. The government protected it, as seen in its proclamations. After the postal service was established, it initially felt inexperienced in performing its duties, and the People's Livelihood Postal Service guided and helped it, especially with its merits. Therefore, after the promulgation of the Postal Law, the Ministry of Communications still formulated registration and licensing methods to maintain it. In recent times, the General Post Office has been ordered by the Ministry to investigate the situation of private postal services, but it does not investigate the current situation and immediately presents a memorial to crack down on them. The Ministry is unaware and strictly orders the termination, with an urgent deadline that cannot be delayed. Although the postal service should be state-owned, which is a common practice in countries around the world, the timing of promoting unification should take into account the national conditions. In today's situation in China, the People's Livelihood Postal Service still has a value in existence. It is true that the transmission in large cities does not rely on the People's Livelihood Postal Service, but in remote rural areas, post offices have not yet been universally established, and it is difficult to implement the crackdown, resulting in a loss of convenience. Furthermore, in terms of the livelihoods of the employees, once the business is terminated, they will have nothing to rely on, and they will be forced into hunger and cold. The old and weak will turn to ditches, and the young and strong will take risks, which is not a blessing for society. While the authorities have the determination to unify the postal service, they should also consider the People's Livelihood Postal Service's aftermath solution while actively improving it, in order to provide relief. However, they are making decisive dispositions, and society is affected, and the employees are especially deeply affected. Therefore, representatives of colleagues from various ports across the country held a joint conference at the Shanghai Postal Service Association, resolving to petition the Fifth Plenary Session and the central government agencies based on the above reasons, and dispatching the presenters as the general representatives of the National People's Livelihood Postal Service to request your Ministry, Government, and Bureau to review and approve, and to temporarily suspend the Ministry of Communications' execution of the consultation to assist in ordering the People's Livelihood Postal Service to terminate at the end of the 22nd year, until the central government has a solution for the aftermath and this matter has been decided, in order to show consideration. We are extremely eager to await orders. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Public Security Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the general representatives of the National People's Livelihood Postal Service, Hua Yunjin, Yin Yuantong, Wang Dashi, Zhuang Gengtang, Yin **Zhensheng, Ren Shiting, and Pan Wentian."</p>
<h3 id="e150">To Beijing Tonight <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>In addition to dispatching seven representatives to petition the five party and road agencies in this city, the industry has also scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing at 11:00 p.m. tonight to join more than 100 representatives of the People's Livelihood Postal Service from twelve provinces who have already gathered in Beijing to petition the five agencies of the Fifth Plenary Session, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Communications, and to appeal to Chairman Chiang, who is in Beijing. It is also learned that representatives of the People's Livelihood Postal Service from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and other places along the Jinghu Road will also go to Beijing on this train.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Aftermath Difficulties <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>According to Yin Yuantong, chairman of the People's Livelihood Postal Service Association, the difficulties of our industry cannot be fully expressed in one sentence. The People's Livelihood Postal Service was founded in the seventh year of Guangxu, earlier than the post office, and has been around for more than 100 years. There are more than 500 People's Livelihood Postal Service companies in twelve provinces across the country, with more than 100,000 employees. Of these employees, 60% to 70% are laborers who have always been hardworking and can endure hardships, running hundreds of miles on rural roads to maintain their livelihoods. Now, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications suddenly ordered the General Post Office to crack down on them, and ordered them to terminate at the end of the year, so the lives of these more than 100,000 People's Livelihood Postal Service employees and their families will be cut off, and they will sit and wait to die. Therefore, representatives from various places have been dispatched to Shanghai to gather and discuss solutions. It has been decided that tomorrow (i.e., today) will be a day of full suspension of business, first petitioning the party and government agencies in this city, and then entering Beijing that night to petition the Fifth Plenary Session and the various yuan and departments, and also to appeal to Chairman Chiang in Beijing, asking him to consider the difficulties of the merchants and pity the lives of more than 100,000 employees and hundreds of thousands of employee family members, and grant an extension of the termination period so that they can gradually change industries during this period, so that hundreds of thousands of people can temporarily maintain their livelihoods. As for the pros and cons of the People's Livelihood Postal Service and the postal service, the People's Livelihood Postal Service can deliver bulky packages that cannot be mailed by the post office, such as large luggage and oily objects, so people in society all consider it convenient. Therefore, once terminated, not only will the people be inconvenienced, but hundreds of thousands of people will also have difficulty maintaining their lives.</p>

<p>The Renji Road Chinese and Foreign Charity Association, due to the widespread drought and famine this year, especially in the Haining areas of western Zhejiang, suffered from donations and felt extremely difficult. Fortunately, it received the strong support of gentry from Haining living in Shanghai, so it勉力措措, and was able to jointly investigate and release emergency relief with the Jishui Society. According to the report of the investigators, the disaster situation in the 531 and other districts of Haining is particularly serious, and the investigation has been completed. It is scheduled to distribute relief to the five districts from the 15th to the 17th of this month, distribute relief to the three districts from the 20th to the 22nd, and distribute relief to the ** district from the 25th to the 27th. In this one county alone, the total amount of relief funds combined is as high as 65,000 yuan, but it can only relieve the immediate need, and the future is long and the disaster victims are too numerous. I really don't know how to end the year. In addition, Changshan, Jiangshan, Longyou, Jinhua, Deqing, Wuxing, Tongxiang, and Qu County are also waiting for relief, and the disasters in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are also severe. At the moment, the cold is severe, and representatives from the disaster areas are coming one after another, speaking until **. At this time, the market is depressed, and the sources are scarce, and the ** relief personnel are no different from**. It is heard that the parties concerned in the association are wandering around the room, and I don't know how to handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Cable Request to Maintain Soybean Oil Import Tax <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Soybean oil in our country has always been a major food item. In the past, the number of products produced in the northeastern provinces was relatively prosperous, and tens of millions of dans were transported to Shanghai every year, causing the oil market in Shanghai to be manipulated for a long time, and the oil mill business gradually declined. After September 18, the government of our country set the import tax on goods transported from the northeast to China at 15% of the value of industrial and commercial products and 30% of the value of food oils, in order to maintain domestic industry and commerce. The oil mills in Shanghai were fortunate to sprout after the rain, and the future was promising. However, recently, it was suddenly heard that someone used the excuse of opposition to secretly submit to the government a request to cancel the previous order. The oil mill colleagues were all surprised and abnormal. Yesterday, the industry association convened a general meeting and immediately resolved to cable the government. The text is as follows: "To President Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, regarding the food soybean oil formerly transported from the northeast to Shanghai, the original tax rate was 15% of the value. Recently, it has been largely changed to 30% of the value in order to eliminate dumping and manipulation in the northeast and maintain our country's industry and commerce. The future of the industry is deeply reliant on this. However, recently, it has been heard that someone used the excuse of opposition to secretly submit a large amount to the ** requesting the cancellation of the previous order. It is found that soybean oil has always been a major food item in our country, and it is only used by industry and commerce. If the previous order is cancelled again, it will inevitably still allow the northeast to dump, manipulate, and destroy domestic products without anything left. We are frightened and earnestly submit our words, respectfully requesting your review, and we will await orders, Zhu Jingan, Chairman of the Shanghai Vegetable Oil Mill Industry Association, bows sincerely."</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Municipal Council Plans to Appoint a Traffic Commissioner <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Police Chief Will Investigate and ** Elect</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Police and Personnel Affairs Committees jointly recommended to the Board of Directors that the Police Chief be instructed to investigate the traffic conditions in major cities during his vacation next year, and to consider in London whether to hire a Traffic Commissioner from that side, or to select a member from the existing personnel of the Police Department. The Board of Directors was immediately informed by telegram and agreed to do so.</p>
<p>The two committees held a joint meeting to discuss the appointment of a Traffic Commissioner. According to the report of the Police Chief, a policeman was already prepared in the reorganization plan of the department to be assigned to external affairs. This ** can be hired separately **, and another member can be dispatched as an assistant. However, the personnel managing traffic must be aware of the local situation. Therefore, it is planned to examine the situation in New York, London, and other places during the vacation, and prepare to hire a policeman who is familiar with traffic affairs. This member must be able to understand the situation in Shanghai in external affairs work within a considerable period of time, and then order him to preside over the traffic affairs. At the same time, a lower-level policeman will be selected as his assistant to prepare to take over external affairs.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Police Chief is that the person managing traffic must be a member who has come from ** police affairs. If a member is selected from the current personnel of the department, he can be sent to Europe to practice for a few months, and can obtain considerable knowledge, and is more suitable than a person hired from outside who is difficult to understand the local situation for a while. The opinion of the Director of Works is that the term "traffic engineer" only refers to a traffic commissioner with sufficient technical knowledge of traffic management. The personnel of the Works Department also have considerable knowledge of this. The Directors of the Works and Police Departments feel that the Works Department and the Police Traffic Section should have more close cooperation.</p>
<p>After discussion by the two committees, the aforementioned recommendation was made. The Board of Directors decided to do so at the meeting on the 12th.</p>
<h3 id="e160">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Returns Registered Old Stamps <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>

Now that the procedure has been completed, the registered businesses can hold the previously issued registration certificate and register with the association from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. every day and lead to the old flowers, waiting for the Ministry of Finance to exchange new flowers. The registration period for old flowers should end at the end of this month. Those who have not registered can rush to register.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Ningbo Road Police Interference in Marriage Disputes <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association: Negotiations with the Bureau of Public Works Director-General</p>
<p>Wang Yaoqing, a native of Zhenhai, reported that his wife had been seduced and had absconded, cohabitating with a policeman. The Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association dispatched personnel to escort her back to her husband, Wang Yaoqing. However, Wang's wife, née Li, was suddenly summoned and released by the Ningbo Road Police Station. The Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association believes that this action by the police station hinders the association's work and, on the previous day, sent a letter to the Bureau of Public Works Director-General, Mr. Zhong Si, and Co-Director Mr. He Zhongliu, making the following requests. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>"Respectfully informing you, our association is organized and established by Ningbo natives residing in Shanghai in the second year of Xuantong (1910). It is registered with the Chinese government as a legitimate civil organization. Our mission, in addition to handling charitable and public welfare undertakings, is to provide amicable mediation for various disputes among fellow countrymen, including those related to marriage and debt. Our history is long, and our reputation is well-established. There is no need for further elaboration from our association.</p>
<p>On the eighth of this month, our association received a report from our fellow townsman, Wang Yaoqing, stating that his wife, Li Guisu, had absconded with belongings to the upper floor of the Chai and Coal store at the Yong'an Lane entrance of Caojiadu, Robert Road, and was cohabitating with Police Officer No. 3333 of the 6th District Public Security Bureau. He was unable to bring her back and requested assistance. After confirming the marriage contract, our association sent our member, Dong Xinqin, accompanied by the aggrieved Wang Yaoqing, with a letter requesting assistance from Inspector Gu Wentao of the district's Public Security Bureau. Inspector Gu dispatched police assistance to escort Li Guisu back. Due to estrangement between the couple, our association was providing amicable reconciliation to achieve harmony.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at noon on the same day, the Ningbo Road Police Station accepted the false accusation of Li Guisu's mother, née Li Xu, and, without investigating the details, immediately sent detectives led by Zhang Yuanjing to the association. With a threatening manner, they took the parties involved, Wang Yaoqing and Li Guisu, away. Subsequently, they summoned our staff members, Dong Xinqin and Lin Zitong. After questioning revealed it was a marital dispute, the police station decided not to handle the case and arbitrarily released the runaway wife, Li Guisu, whom our association and the Public Security Bureau had escorted back. They also did not thoroughly investigate Li Xu, who had fabricated the false accusation.</p>
<p>The police station's handling of this case seems to lack due recognition of our association's position and clearly hinders our work. After deliberation by our association members, we unanimously assert:</p>
<p>(1) We request your bureau to investigate and reprimand the personnel responsible for handling this case.</p>
<p>(2) We request assurance that similar incidents will not occur again in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, we briefly narrate the circumstances and request your esteemed Director-General to review and handle the matter and provide a reply."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Foot-and-Mouth Disease Outbreak Among Shanghai Cattle <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Health Bureau Taking Preventative Measures</p>
<p>Beef Supply to Be Short in the Short Term</p>
<p>Foot-and-mouth disease has been discovered among cattle in Shanghai. This disease is an acute infectious disease of cloven-hoofed animals, characterized by vesicular rashes on the skin and mucous membranes, especially in the mouth and between the hooves. It is caused by a bacterium, and contact with secretions of the mucous membrane easily leads to infection. Once the toxin enters the bloodstream, it invades the deeper mucous membranes. If not prevented early, it can spread widely, significantly impacting both animal husbandry and the economy and potentially infecting humans.</p>
<p>It is reported that the outbreak was discovered early, and the Health Bureau, together with the Epidemic Prevention Institute and the Bureau of Public Works Health Department, is taking preventative measures, hoping to eradicate it soon.</p>
<p>According to news from the Bureau of Public Works Intelligence Office, at yesterday's (12th) Bureau of Public Works Board meeting, the Director-General presented a report stating that cattle transported to Shanghai from the interior have recently been found to have foot-and-mouth disease. The Bureau is cooperating with other government offices to eliminate this pestilence. However, the beef supply in Shanghai is bound to be short in the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>Recently, veterinary officers from the Ministry of Industry, the Municipal Government, the French Concession, and the International Settlement held a meeting. They jointly confirmed that foot-and-mouth disease had broken out. However, the nature of the disease seems mild. It is generally found in cattle transported from northern Jiangsu and Anhui or is transmitted in transit. The medical officers decided to request the relevant government offices to prohibit the import of cattle from these areas. The authorities are making every effort to restore the meat supply to normal as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Joint Association Representative Conference had elected Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of the China Yapu'er Factory, as one of the preparatory committee members.

<p>(Omitted above) "I recently read in the newspaper and learned that your association's standing committee has decided to convene a manufacturers' representative conference this month. I am grateful for your mistaken praise in electing me as one of the preparatory committee members. However, I have become increasingly busy with affairs and am often away from Shanghai. I am afraid that I will fail to live up to my name and not contribute to the party's affairs in this preparatory committee position. Therefore, I respectfully submit this letter of resignation, hoping that you will elect other capable individuals to avoid any unnecessary delay."</p>

As children's health is closely related to diet, it has scheduled a lecture on "Children's Health and Diet" at its premises at 5 PM on December 13, featuring Mrs. Huang Xiuzhen (i.e., Ms. Huang Guibao). Mrs. Huang has been to the United States twice, specializing in the study of diet, treatment, and bacteriology at the University of Chicago and Columbia University. She also served as the director of the food service department at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and is an expert in dietary therapy. Mrs. Huang has done much research on children's dietary problems and will certainly contribute much knowledge. It is reported that in addition to inviting members of the association, parents with children and those who study children's diet are welcome to attend the discussion.</p>

The donations from each troop were turned in on the evening of the 11th. To build social trust, the City Boy Scout Council handled the donation matters very seriously. All staff of the association worked through the night for consecutive days. The total amount of donations has been finalized at the time each troop turned in their donations on the evening of the 11th. A total of 7,506 yuan in silver dollars, 8,925 jiao and one-fifth in subsidiary coins, 109,578 small silver coins, and 48,4927 copper coins were received.

<p>More Than 10,000 Yuan Has Been Remitted to Hong Kong, Intercepted by Telegram</p>
<p>Liang Arrested in the Public Concession and Sent to Court</p>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs has recently had an embezzlement case, and now the person and the stolen goods have been seized, and the truth has come out. After investigating, Liang took advantage of Minister Huang Shaohong's resignation and colluded with a colleague, Zhang, to withdraw more than 40,000 yuan in cash from the ministry's bank deposit and absconded to Shanghai. After discovering this, the ministry telegraphed Minister Huang in Shanghai, who was furious and immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, which in turn informed the police to step up their pursuit. At the same time, the ministry also investigated bank remittances. It was found at the Bank of China that the person had remitted more than 10,000 yuan to Hong Kong, which was intercepted by telegram. On the second day, Liang was arrested in the Shanghai Public Concession, and more than 10,000 yuan in cash was found on his person and in his residence. All but the squandered funds were recovered. Liang and others have now been sent to the local court to be subject to legal judgment.</p>
<p>Pingliang Road, Inside the New Port</p>
<h3 id="e178">Female Cadaver With Knife Wounds Discovered <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Back of Neck and Throat Punctured</p>
<p>Appears To Have Been Moved and Dumped After Death</p>
<p>In the water inside the New Port at the side of an empty ground behind the Gongdi Spinning Factory at the bottom of Yangshupu, near the intersection of Pingliang Road, a female cadaver with knife wounds was discovered on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Someone caught a glimpse of it and reported it to the Yinxianggang Police Station, which telephoned the river police. The police station immediately dispatched Chinese Detective Shen Changshan, Liang Shenqing, and Western Detective Macdonald (transliteration) to inspect the scene. They found that the short-haired female cadaver was about 30 years old. She had a gold tooth on the left side of her mouth. She was wearing a red striped foreign cloth short shirt, a green boned white flannel undershirt, black maoge lined pants, striped flower flannel lined shoes, and a blue maoge unlined outer pants with a yuan-colored satin trim. She was wearing pink gauze socks and black wool high-topped cotton shoes. Next to the cadaver on the shore was a black camel hair qipao, with a blue foreign cloth qipao overcoat. A large hole was cut into the back of the cadaver's neck with a sharp blade before death. There were also two knife wounds on the left and right sides of the throat, and the trachea was severed, which was a very tragic sight. It was clearly a murder case where the body was moved and dumped here, so there was no water in the cadaver's abdomen.</p>
<p>The detectives then carefully investigated the surrounding area and found blood stains about 450 feet away from the cadaver, near the seventh lamp pole on Jungong Road. There was a hole of about three to four inches in the ground, in which vomited food was found. There was also fresh blood about 300 feet away from the hole. According to Chief Zhang Shixun of the police station, a large pair of scissors used for the crime was found near the bloodstain at the lamp pole. The blade of the scissors was covered in blood. There was also a white foreign-style green wooden comb inlaid with silver stars and a white handkerchief stained with blood.</p>
<p>The above three items were handed over by the detectives to Shen Changshan of the river police and taken back to the police station. After reporting the situation to the chief, the female cadaver was taken by boat to the Jinshapu beach in Nanshi and temporarily placed there. The chief prepared a letter together with the murder weapon, the comb, and the handkerchief, and ordered Detective Shen Changshan to submit them to the local court for an inquest.</p>
<p>Judge Wu Deying opened the court and summoned him for questioning. Detective Shen explained the situation and presented the murder weapon to the court. After the question officer examined it, he ordered to submit it for further review, then led Inspector Yi Zhiming to the scene, examined and concluded that the female cadaver had her throat cut with scissors before her death, causing her death. After completing the coroner's report, the officer ordered an examination and decided to put the body in a coffin while waiting to arrest the murderer to punish him.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyu's Son, Manager of the Siyi Silk Factory, Was Kidnapped</p>
<h3 id="e179">Used the Delivery of Red Eggs as a Pretext to Threaten With Guns <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Kidnapped Zhang's Son Into a Car and Never Returned</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyu, a native of Sheng County, Zhejiang, is 36 years old. He lives at No. 10, Lane 423 (i.e., Sencheng Lane) at the intersection of Kunming Road and Dalian Road in the Public Concession. His wife, née Tong, has two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Geyang, is four years old, and the second son, Xiaoyang, is one year old. The eldest daughter, Puzi, is ten years old, and the second daughter, Xiaopu, is seven years old. Zhang has been in the silk business for many years, painstakingly managing it and making some progress. He and his friends jointly invested in the Siyi and Pingwei silk weaving factories in Qingfuli on Zhoujiazui Road and Huaxingfang on Baoding Road. Zhang was appointed as the manager of the two factories, unexpectedly attracting the attention of bandits.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a little after one o'clock, Zhang had gone out to discuss business matters and had not yet returned home. Three bandits suddenly came to his residence and knocked on the back door of Zhang's house. Zhang's wife was washing dishes in the kitchen at the time, and his eldest son, Geyang, was also nearby. When they heard someone knocking, they went to open the door and saw that one of the three men was carrying a small basket containing ten red eggs, and another man was holding a red invitation card. They asked to speak to Mrs. Zhang and claimed that someone had asked them to deliver the red eggs to Mr. Zhang. Mrs. Tong immediately replied that he had gone out and had not returned. The bandits then asked Mrs. Tong, "Are you Mrs. Zhang?" Mrs. Tong hesitated because the men looked suspicious. The bandits then went into the kitchen, took out a pistol, and threatened her. Mrs. Tong was shocked and quickly ran into the front hall. However, the bandits did not chase her, but exited through the back door, snatched her eldest son, Geyang, out of the lane, jumped into a car parked at the entrance of the lane, and sped away. By the time Mrs. Zhang realized what had happened and chased after them, they had already disappeared.</p>
<p>She immediately reported to the police station in charge, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to conduct a search and asked in detail about the clothing and appearance of the bandits. It was reported that one of the three bandits was wearing a black long robe, a small cap, and was about 40 years old. One was wearing a leather short jacket and was about 30 years old, and one was wearing a light gray long robe and was about 30 years old. All spoke with a Shaoxing accent and seemed very familiar with Zhang's family situation. The police are currently conducting a widespread search and arrest.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Preliminary Hearing of Yi Fangshuo's Case <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Li Xiaozhen and Yi Shizhu Were Both Raped</p>
<p>Police Investigation Incomplete, Postponed for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a Hangzhou native residing at No. 147, Baxianfang Entrance, Huagenei Road, French Concession, is 43 years old this year. He used to perform comic dramas at the Xinxin Company's game arena on Nanjing Road and organized the Fangshuo Spirit Troupe for comic songs to perform at celebratory banquets. Besides his legal wife, Jin Dasen, he also had three concubines: Yi Caitao (23 years old, from Suzhou), Yi Meimei (also known as Li Meizhen, 21 years old, from Hangzhou), and Yi Didi (24 years old, from Changzhou). He taught them skills and took them to performances. He also had young female performers Li Xiaozhen (13 years old, from Hangzhou, the younger sister of his concubine Yi Meimei, who came to Shanghai in August this year), Yi Shizhu (19 years old, from Hangzhou, Yi's cousin), Zhang Qincai (13 years old, from Shanghai), Chen Meiying (13 years old, from Hangzhou), Chen Fengying (16 years old, from Hangzhou), Yang Lindi (12 years old, from Pinghu), Chen Xiaofang (16 years old, from Suzhou), Yang Zhuzhu (12 years old, from Pinghu), etc.  At 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, Yi Baozhu, Yi's cousin, suddenly reported to the French police, accusing Yi Fangshuo of rape and assault. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives Xie Zhiming, Liu Songtian, and Tao Hongsheng to rush to the scene. They took Yi, along with his concubines Yi Caitao, Yi Meimei, Yi Didi, and all the young female performers, to the General Police Station. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that Li Xiaozhen had also been raped twice, and Yi Baozhu had been raped as many as five times. The police chief immediately detained Yi. The plaintiff, Yi Zhuzhu, and Xiaozhen were temporarily kept outside the police station, and all the others were released. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Special District Court for questioning. At this time, Yi's legal wife arrived at the court with lawyer Zhu Honglie, also intending to join the accusation against Yi Fangshuo for rape, but she was dissuaded by relatives and friends. At 11 a.m., Judge Shan Chaozu ascended to the criminal court to conduct the hearing. He first questioned the defendant Yi Fangshuo about his age, origin, and address, and Yi stated that he lived in Shanghai with his mother, younger brother, and legal wife Jin Dasen, also known as Xu Guizhen, and that he had a daughter, named Sannan, who was 11 years old this year, and an adopted son who was 8 years old this year. He said that he currently performs comic dramas at Xinxin Company and earns 500 yuan per month. Next, he questioned the plaintiff Yi Baozhu, who stated, "The defendant is my cousin. My father and his father were brothers. I was adopted by my aunt when I was two or three years old, and when I was eight years old, my parents passed away. I came to Shanghai to the defendant's place on November 14th last year." Li Xiaozhen also stated, "I am 13 years old, and the defendant is my brother-in-law. Yi Meimei is my sister. I came to Shanghai to the defendant's place in August this year." At this point, police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stood up and stated the facts of the case, briefly stating that the defendant was arrested for the crimes of disturbing public morals and restricting freedom. Currently, the police investigation is incomplete, so he requested a postponement and temporary detention of the defendant until the facts of the case are clarified and the case can be prosecuted. At the same time, he requested that the court temporarily send the two plaintiffs, the victims, to charitable organizations because they have no residence, until the case is adjudicated. The court acknowledged the report and, considering the case involved morality, announced that spectators were prohibited. After the spectators left, the judge began a detailed interrogation of the two plaintiffs, Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen, and the defendant, Yi Fangshuo, which lasted for an hour before concluding. The court then ordered the case to be adjourned until the 21st for further hearing, and the defendant was remanded to custody. Yi Shizhu and Li Xiaozhen, after being sent to the forensic doctor for examination, would be sent back to the court for placement after the police investigation was completed. The court then adjourned. At 3 p.m., the two women were taken to the forensic lab by bailiffs. After the forensic examination, they were sent back to the court. After Judge Zhang inquired about the addresses of their hometown relatives, he ruled that Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen should be temporarily detained at the court's detention center for investigation, pending a decision on the case, before being placed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Preliminary Hearing Today</p>
<p>Recently, someone impersonated the advisor to the French Minister to China, Gu Weijun, and the interpreter of the French Embassy to China, claiming to be able to facilitate the opening of a gambling den in the French Concession and issue licenses. The scheme was discovered by the French police. The anti-gambling detectives Hang Bingquan, Cai Zongyi, He Zongyu, Zhu Junpei, Liu Delin, Tan Rongxuan, etc., disguised as capitalists, pretended to negotiate, and arranged to meet at Room 301 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street. They successively arrested eight swindlers: Yang Yingchu, Cai Baoshan, Yang Dingguo, Pan Shucan, Wang Boqing, Fu Fengshan, Pi Xichun, and Zhu Zhensheng, and seized a large amount of evidence, documents, and lottery equipment. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for detention, pending detailed investigation. It is reported that the police believe the case is complex and the evidence is diverse, so they have been assigning additional personnel to conduct a thorough investigation in recent days. The preliminary investigation has been completed, and the defendants will be escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court at 9 a.m. today for the official preliminary hearing.</p>

<p>Zhu Songshou's Life in Danger</p>
<p>A Pitiful Case of Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Zhu Songshou, from Anhui Province, thirty years old, formerly worked at the stamp tax bureau in Fengtian Province, Northeast China. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and stayed at Room 539 of the Oriental Hotel at the intersection of Xizang Road and Guangdong Road. Zhu suffers from neurasthenia and insomnia, and therefore relies on sleeping pills to fall asleep. However, since arriving in Shanghai, he has been suffering from worse insomnia due to not being used to the lifestyle, and swallowing two or three sleeping pills has been ineffective. As a result, Zhu swallowed more than ten sleeping pills before going to sleep the night before last, and soon fell asleep. However, at around 9 a.m. yesterday morning, Zhu's friend Wang Yi, who was staying in the same room, suddenly heard a moan, so he quickly got up to check and saw Zhu moaning in bed, unconscious, with blood flowing from his mouth and nose non-stop. Knowing that something unexpected had happened, he quickly reported to the front desk, who in turn reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Zhu was taken to the hospital for treatment. Although emergency treatment was given, his condition is critical, and his life is not yet guaranteed.</p>

<p>Good News for Leather Garment Owners</p>
<p>Old leather garments can be cleaned, which has been done in our country for a long time, but there has been no research or improvement. The old method of cleaning with light oil and old powder has been adhered to. Therefore, once the leather is cleaned, not only can the dirt not be removed, but it often causes deterioration and yellowing of the fur. This kind of suffering cannot be solved by leather garment owners, and the cleaning industry has no way to solve it. Now, the Shanghai New-Method Cleaning and Dyeing Cooperative, organized by the six major and most reputable cleaning companies in the city with the longest history, located at 644-646 Xiafei Road, French Concession, Hequn, 570 Sichuan Road, Sino-American, 1176 Jing'an Temple Road, Minghua, 18 North Sichuan Road, Dazhong, 948 Xiafei Road, Mingxing, and 97 Wusong Road, Xili, etc., has invented a scientific leather cleaning method in the chemical research laboratory specially established by the cooperative. The results of the experiment are very satisfactory. No matter what kind of leather, all leather cleaned by the above six companies using the scientific leather cleaning method can be renewed. The cooperative now announces this to the public and charges only at cost.</p>

<p>The Court and the Municipal Council Strictly Punish Such Actions</p>
<p>Shamenov's Scheme Ultimately Fails</p>
<p>In the past, when the legal rights of the concessions had not yet been recovered by our country, unscrupulous merchants would often claim foreign nationality in lawsuits and rely on foreign consuls as a shield to obtain various illegal conveniences. After the Mixed Court was abolished, the system of consular assessors was abolished, and our country established formal courts in the concessions, this trend of claiming foreign nationality in lawsuits disappeared. Unexpectedly, in recent years, the embers have gradually rekindled. When debtors are sued by creditors and the court renders a final judgment, such as when the court orders the seizure of their property, these people temporarily try to claim that their shops or properties have foreign capital or that they have claimed foreign nationality, in the hope of preventing enforcement. This kind of absurd act of borrowing foreign power to undermine the country's judiciary has recently spread to Russian nationals who have no consular jurisdiction. One person leads the way, and the masses follow suit. If such incidents are not closely monitored,</p>
<h3 id="e189">Serious Crackdown Needed <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The impact will be profound, and the drawbacks will increase. The Legal Department of the Municipal Council is also deeply disgusted and resentful of this kind of fraudulent claim of nationality to avoid enforcement and undermine legal authority. For example, the recent incident of Russian Shamenov tearing down the seal of the First Special District Court that sealed his shop has been prosecuted according to law. This is because if this trend is allowed to continue, the consequences will be endless. The incident arose when Russian Shamenov, who opened the "Fumaina" silk shop at No. 940 Jing'an Temple Road, was sued by the German company Lianzhong Trading Company for owing money for goods. The First Special Court ruled against the plaintiff in the first instance on June 12th last year. The German company was not satisfied and appealed, and the Second Branch of the High Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff in the second instance, ordering the Russian to repay</p>
<h3 id="e190">Outstanding Debt <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>and interest. However, Shamenov claimed to be dissatisfied and filed a third appeal to the Supreme Court. The result was that Lianzhong Company ultimately won. After the third trial was finalized, the First Special Court approved Lianzhong's application and ordered the "Fumaina" shop to be sealed as collateral. On the 23rd of last month, a bailiff and police officer were specially dispatched</p>
<h3 id="e191">Seal <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Together with the Jing'an Temple Police Station, the shop was sealed. Surprisingly, only five days after the sealing, Shamenov dared to secretly tear off the seal, break into the shop, and take all the goods stored in the shop. The police station was informed and sent detectives to investigate. The Russian suddenly claimed that the shop belonged to a Frenchman named Bascou. According to the landlord of the shop, the tenant "Fumaina" silk shop signed a lease agreement on October 1st of this year for a period of two years, but on October 15th, Shamenov, in the name of the Jinmei Silk and Satin Shop representative,</p>
<h3 id="e192">Lease Agreement <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>assigned the agreement to Frenchman Bascou. The police then investigated with the company that publishes the Shanghai name directory, the "Rossen Silk and Scrimshaw Forest Newspaper", and the China Credit Bureau, etc. Some entries listed the shop owner of "Fumaina" as Shamenov, and some only registered the shop name without the owner's name, but no connection between Bascou and the shop was found. It was also noted that when a Russian person accused Shamenov of criminal activity last winter on November 21st, the First Special Court ordered him to pay a security deposit of 1,000 yuan. When a police officer was dispatched to the shop to investigate, he also claimed that he was the sole owner of the shop. All these facts are sufficient to prove that the shop was indeed established by Shamenov. This</p>
<h3 id="e193">Sudden Change of Ownership <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>is to avoid the seizure, falsely claiming French nationality, and hoping to undermine our country's legal authority by not being subject to the jurisdiction of the First Special Court. The Legal Department of the Municipal Council believes that Shamenov's actions not only damage the creditor's rights but are also very serious in nature. Moreover, if this trend is allowed to continue, the consequences will be even worse. Therefore, lawyer Ru Baozhao, representing the bureau, filed a public prosecution against Shamenov, requesting punishment in accordance with Article 384 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court brought the defendant to court for questioning. First, lawyer Ru stated the intent of the prosecution, and then the defendant's defense lawyer said that they were currently negotiating a settlement with Lianzhong Company, hoping not to hinder the court's enforcement, and requested an extension. Lianzhong Company also invited lawyer Lin Yingqing to court and expressed their agreement to the defendant's request. Judge Huang then ordered Shamenov to be detained and adjourned the hearing for seven days. After this stern response, those who illegally change the ownership of property and rely on foreign power may be silenced.</p>

<p>Zhou Dingxian's Lawlessness Reaches Extremes</p>
<p>Female Worker Ma Fenjuan Unknowingly Deceived</p>
<p>Ma Mengshi, a Shaoxing woman residing at No. 73 Ximen Road, French Concession, has a beautiful daughter named Fenjuan, who is fifteen years old this year. Between the 14th of the fourth month of the lunar calendar last year, the daughter was unemployed when she happened to meet fellow villagers Yang Wanwan and Zhou Dingxian visiting her home for a chat. Yang said that Zhou worked at the Meili Silk Factory in Baziqiao, Zhabei, and could introduce the daughter, but according to the factory's rules, each female worker had to pay a deposit of thirty gold yuan. Mrs. Ma found this agreeable and agreed to raise the money. After a few days, she handed the money to Yang Wanwan and asked him to pass it on to Zhou. However, Yang only paid fifteen yuan and pocketed the rest. After investigating, Mrs. Ma found out that she had been deceived and had her daughter go to the factory to inquire, but there was no such thing. Later, she looked for Yang and Zhou to negotiate, but they avoided her without a trace. Mrs. Ma had no choice but to lament her misfortune. Recently, her daughter was recommended by someone to work as a female worker at the Weitong Yarn Factory on Lan Road, Yangshupu, and rented a house at No. 39 Hongxingli, Qiwupu Road, to live with other female workers, so that it would be close to the factory. Zhou, who now lives at No. 26, Lane 473, Dalian Road, saw that Ma's daughter had become fashionable recently and was more beautiful than before. Zhou, who is in his thirties, is still single and desires to take advantage of her. Knowing that the girl</p>
<p>was young and could be deceived, he went to her place at around 11 p.m. the night before last and falsely claimed that the money she entrusted to him for a job at the silk factory had been embezzled by Yang Wanwan. He said that Yang was playing mahjong with friends in Room 22 of the Dade Hotel at No. 14 in the same lane, and that he would accompany her to get the money back. The daughter, unaware of his deceit, happily went with him. When they arrived at the hotel, Zhou said that there were many friends in Yang's room and that they should go upstairs, close the door, and use all kinds of sweet talk to make the girl unable to resist and commit rape twice. This was discovered by Chinese detective Huang Fugen of the Huishan Police Station, who, together with a foreign detective, arrested Zhou at the address and took him to the police station for detention. The girl was sent to Guangren Hospital for examination. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The case was related to public morals, and the hearing was closed to the public. The court ruled that a sentence would be announced at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e197">What Kind of Policy Should China Adopt to Cope with World Changes? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Lecture by Zhang Yuanruo (Notes by Li Guangteng)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Association is holding a broadcasting lecture to promote international knowledge. The first broadcast was given by political scholar Zhang Yuanruo, and his speech was very cautionary. The original manuscript is as follows: Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be invited by the Shanghai Educational Association to give a broadcasting lecture today. The topic I will be speaking on today is "What kind of policy should China adopt to cope with world changes?" The scope of this topic is very broad, and if I were to discuss it in detail, I would not have enough time today. I can only study the following two points:</p>
<h3 id="e198">I. An Overview of the Global Situation <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Regarding when and where future global upheavals will occur, scholars, politicians, and diplomats hold differing opinions. Some say the center of future wars will be in Europe, while others claim they will erupt in the Far East. Both arguments have their rationale and possibilities. As for which, Europe or the Far East, will be first, I dare not make a definitive judgment. (I spoke in detail about the situation in Europe in 1936 at the YMCA; I encourage you to consult newspaper reports on that.) However, both regions are, in fact, powder kegs for future world wars, with the potential for war to break out at any moment. According to the American scholar Steel, the Second World War will originate from the contest for [missing characters] between two [missing characters]. In the Far East, it will stem from Japan's aggression against eastern Siberia. In my opinion, international relations are intricate, possessing an inseparable cyclical nature: the Far East is connected to Europe, and Europe is also connected to the Far East. Both regions are potential flashpoints for future world wars. Comparatively speaking, however, the explosiveness of the Far East is perhaps greater. The reasons are: 1. After the Great War, the center of world politics has shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. 2. The focus of major powers' interest struggles is now in the Far East. 3. Japanese militarists are ambitious and eager for recognition. Having not suffered the hardships of a major war, they are always looking to test their ambitions. According to recent news reports, Japan has unilaterally abandoned the naval treaty. This will naturally affect the balance of power in the Far East and symbolizes the increasing likelihood of a future world war. From this brief analysis of the global situation, we can infer how severely and dangerously we will be affected should a world war erupt in the Far East. This is the first point.</p>
<h3 id="e199">II. The Course We Should Take <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The next question is: if a future world war breaks out in the Far East, which countries will be the main protagonists? Will it be Russia and Japan, or Japan and the United States? What will be the situation in the Far East, and what course should China take in this crisis to safeguard national survival? This can be briefly discussed in four parts: (A) I believe the main antagonists in the Far East will be Russia and Japan. Historically, they are historical enemies. The conflict of interests between them is more intense and acute than that between Japan and the United States. Since occupying Korea, Japan has been scheming to expand into Northeast China. Since the September 18th Incident, the conflict with Russia has intensified. Although the conflict between Japan and the United States is also severe, Japan has traditionally had two factions: the maritime policy faction and the continental policy faction. The target of the maritime policy faction is, of course, the United States. The target of the continental policy faction is, of course, Soviet Russia. Currently, Japan is focusing on the development of its continental policy, which is even more emphasized than its maritime policy, and Soviet Russia's military preparations are more intense than those of the United States. (B) Once a war breaks out in the Far East, before deciding on a course of action, we must carefully and thoroughly analyze the international situation and the interests of all parties involved to be able to cope with it adequately. We cannot definitively say what the situation will be after a major war erupts; it depends on a country's foreign policy. In other words, the situation is not entirely passive but can be shaped by us. According to Chang Hsiung, it is likely that a coalition of the United States and Russia against Japan may form. The reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia proves the trend and possibility of a US-Russian alliance against Japan. As for Britain's foreign policy, it traditionally embraces a "wait and see" approach. We cannot easily grasp British foreign policy now because it is hesitant to express its position. In fact, the conflict of interests between Britain and Japan has become an open secret, which is discernible to those who understand international relations. Because the world is now capitalist, especially the "mercantilist" British Empire, it prioritizes economic interests. As everyone knows, the foundation of the British Empire is in the Far East, in India. If Japan were to dominate the Far East and the Pacific, it would inevitably shake the British Empire's outer line of defense in the Far East. Britain would be unable to maintain its base in India and would have to retreat to Suez. Wouldn't this be the collapse of the entire British Empire? Therefore, if a future war occurs in the Far East, there is a possibility of a US-Russian-British alliance. Some may argue that the conflict between Britain and the United States in the Far East is also significant. However, we must understand that although Britain and the United States inevitably have conflicts, if a war breaks out in the Far East, due to the geographical relationship of their colonies and the racial ties between them, they will ultimately unite and jointly resist Japan. (Regarding this point, please refer to the editorial by Gavin, the editor of the British Observer, and the Reuter's dispatch from London on November 3rd). (C) Now we must discuss what course China should take in this future global upheaval. Undoubtedly, our greatest enemy at present is Japanese imperialism. If we want to cope with this crisis, if we want to escape from death, the most important thing is to skillfully utilize the conflicts between Russia and Japan, Japan and the United States, and Japan and Britain to create a grand alliance of China, Russia, the United States, and Britain to restrain Japan. In this way, Japan will naturally be isolated in a "besieged on all sides" situation and will collapse on its own. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e203">Optimism for the Future of National Goods <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>For years, living in this time of national crisis, there have been few optimistic facts to report. Only the promotion of national goods has had some small effect. Everywhere you go, people feel that promoting national goods is morally right and that using them is everyone's duty. From the small clerk in a company to economic experts like Ma Yinchu, on the platform and in essays, they all say that the only way to save China, save the economy from national crisis, and reverse the outflow of silver is to promote and use national goods. In recent years, the consistent promotion of national goods has had some effect. You only need to go to a national goods company to see the crowds of male and female customers, and the batches of goods being manufactured in national goods factories, to feel a bit optimistic. Mr. Zhang Gongquan said in his speech at the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association the other day: "The same ten months of import surplus, in 1932, was 690 million yuan, in 1933, it was 570 million yuan, and this year, 1934, it is only 150 million yuan. This cannot but be attributed to the effectiveness of promoting national goods. In the future, if everyone in the national goods industry cooperates, focuses on improving manufacturing, reducing costs, and urges the government to increase tariffs, and if those in the industry seek further integration, then the economic national crisis will be a good opportunity for the development of our national goods industry. Even the universally alarming silver tide can be solved by this." Mr. Zhang's optimistic words about the future of national goods indeed encourage the courage and enthusiasm of those in the national goods industry. I think comrades in the national goods industry will certainly be happy to accept these words and be willing to work hard.</p>
<p>National Goods Suggestions</p>
<h3 id="e204">Suggestions for (National Goods Year for Students) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>The wheels of time are constantly rolling forward. As the "National Goods Year for Women" is about to come to an end, the words "National Goods Year for Students" have already been written on the path of progress. Clearly, this is an indication of the tireless efforts of those promoting national goods. This year's failure will be harvested into next year's success. The so-called treatment of a five-year illness cannot be achieved in a single day. We should adhere to the spirit of continuous effort and perseverance to gradually make progress. At this time of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, we should have grand plans and establish a strict plan and policy as a reference for future progress, seeking a way out of the darkness.</p>
<p>However, (the past can be a guide), as we continue to make persistent efforts, we should try our best to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. We must understand why the "National Goods Year for Women" failed. In a word, it was because it did not work in a down-to-earth manner. In particular, the ladies and misses forgot their obligations and missions. Their fondness and worship of foreign goods did not change at all, making the staggering number of imported perfumes and cosmetics a concrete fact - a lesson of failure and pain for us.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the "National Goods Year for Students" is about to begin, (prevention is better than cure), we should first recognize that students are the most outstanding members of society, young people with ambition and potential. Their every move is enough to shift the attention of the entire nation, gaining importance and inspiring faith. The anti-goods movements of the May Fourth and May Thirtieth Movements are powerful evidence. Now, entrusting this responsibility to them to apply their skills will surely achieve (twice the result with half the effort). However, words alone are useless. We should have practical suggestions. Below, I will put forward two points based on my personal opinions, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>1. Schools should ban foreign goods. From New Year's Day next year, all schools nationwide should uniformly adopt national goods. All clothing, stationery, instruments, equipment, and all miscellaneous utensils must absolutely prohibit the use of foreign goods. Teachers and students should jointly organize a national goods usage committee to supervise each other and bear the responsibility of inspection. If violations occur on either side, the most severe punishment should be imposed.</p>
<p>2. Implement national goods education. The call for national goods education has been around for a long time, but it has not been implemented. However, next year, in the "National Goods Year for Students," it is necessary to implement it conscientiously. For example, regarding the reasons for using national goods and the knowledge of distinguishing national goods, it is best for the Ministry of Education to compile textbooks and order all schools to teach them, instilling them with knowledge. A national goods lecture series should be organized, and national goods celebrities should be invited to give lectures at schools during weekends and holidays to make it more interesting. In this way, I think next year's results will definitely be more satisfactory than this year's!</p>
<p>National Goods Talk</p>
<h3 id="e205">National Goods Advertising and Broadcasting <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Dao Qin</p>
<p>Modern advertising is advancing, changing with each passing day, and making rapid progress. Newspapers have newspaper advertisements, publications have publication advertisements, and there are even roadside and wall advertisements, and electric moving advertisements. In recent years, since the rise of radio, in large cities or areas with developed electrical industries, advertising has been broadcast. Residents only need to have a radio to listen, and even without leaving their homes, they can understand current affairs, international news, commercial situations, and the marketing of emerging products. It is truly a convenient and rapid tool for transmitting information.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, there are no fewer than two hundred large and small broadcasting stations. Among them, only a few broadcast international news and current affairs. Most are for business purposes, specializing in broadcasting advertisements for factories and commercial firms. According to my usual observations, there are still few national goods manufacturers who entrust broadcasting, and only a few, such as Chinese and Western pharmacies that are self-prepared and family industrial societies that borrow from the Li Shutang Drugstore, are like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. It is a pity that they have not been able to carry out large-scale, widespread publicity.</p>
<p>It must be said that in this era of commercial competition and foreign goods dumping, if our national goods factories do not implement the policy of small profits and quick sales, advertising, and publicity, they will not be able to consolidate their position and seek progress for the national goods industry. In my opinion, national goods manufacturers, in addition to newspaper and publication advertisements, should also broadcast on the radio according to the season or adapt to the environment and needs to promote the sales of their products, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. I hope that those who have not joined will try it as soon as possible, and those who have already joined must consider the following two points:</p>
<p>First, when introducing the special qualities of a product, it must be explained that this quality is indeed superior to foreign goods and that the value is indeed cheaper than foreign goods. With the fluent and lively words of the broadcaster, making a pleasant and attractive publicity, the resulting attraction cannot be measured in distance.</p>
<p>Second, when introducing national goods products, foreign goods must be used as a comparison. For example, it can be said: "The Invincible Brand Tooth Powder of the Family Industrial Society can replace the Diamond Brand Tooth Powder of the enemy." "Invincible Brand Face Cream can replace foreign Palm Olive Cream and White Jade Cream." "The Double Dragon Brand Wool Yarn of the Zhenxing Woolen Mill can replace the Bee Brand Wool Yarn of foreign goods." "The Minsheng Brand Ink of the Minsheng Factory can replace the Stephens and Waterman Ink of foreign goods." "The Steel Plate of the Lizhong Copper File Factory can replace the stencil version of the enemy goods."......And so on, not only can it be used for advertising, but also to instill in people very good knowledge and concepts of distinguishing national goods and non-national goods. Isn't it a win-win situation?</p>

<h3 id="e206">A Record of the Opening of the Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>The Municipal Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Goods held the Second Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition at the Caojiadu Zhaoji Middle School sports field on the 19th anniversary of the uprising of the Zhaochang warship. The Book of Songs says "Started with the twelve states", and it also says "Start the carriage and the ox far clothing Jia", this start word, made the beginning also the Minye solution, today's opening date, and the meeting place, both contain a start word, how clever the matter, is it that promoting national goods, from this later, can really promote sales at home, and expand to abroad, to conform to the words of far clothing Jia? The next day, various newspapers were limited in space, and the details were not detailed. This move was the grand event of the last month of the National Goods Year for Women, and special publicity was made at that time to end it. Therefore, I am not afraid of the triviality of Song Suo, and I will supplement the details that are not detailed in the various newspapers below, which I think is also what patriotic compatriots would like to hear.</p>
<p>On this day, Chou Cheng went to the gate of the business building at 2:00 pm and saw the pine and cypress building erected, towering high, with four electric light bulbs of more than a foot in diameter hanging inside, which were special publicity products of the Yaboer Electric Appliance Factory. Because it had not yet been unveiled, the viewers at the door were crowded and could not enter. At 3:00 pm, the opening ceremony was held at the Yongyi Shantang of the Security Regiment. When Chen Yiting reported the purpose of the meeting, he said that in the fierce promotion of the National Goods Year for Women, the increase in import surplus was very alarming. Therefore, before the National Goods Year for Women was about to end, after the end of the Sixth National Goods Movement, another National Goods Exhibition was held to have a closer approach with the citizens of Shanghai West, and a general shout for national goods products, and to expose the recent evil policy of the Japanese to dump inferior goods in our country, exchange the middle and transport bank notes, transport them to the pseudo-country, exchange them at the middle and transport banks, so that the turnover of our country's financial industry is not good, and we have to transport silver exports, and to advise the people not to buy foreign goods, so as to avoid the outflow of rights. Other representatives of the municipal party department, fire brigade, Zhaoji Middle School, and National Goods Maintenance Association spoke, or advocated that manufacturers should make extra sacrifices so that compatriots in the industrial area could buy national goods, or advised shopkeepers to be kind and cheerful so that women and children would be willing to enter and visit and adopt them, or scolded foreign merchants for being insidious and advised people to regard foreign goods as poisons and avoid them, which were all very sincere. Finally, Lin Kanghou was invited to raise the flag, and Lin Kecong was unveiled. Yu Gu said to Erlin, "It is difficult to hold alone, how can a tree support a mansion", today the surnames of the two gentlemen, there are four trees in common, not only the four pillars in the hall, the foundation is consolidated, which can be seen here, this is also a good omen for the promotion of national goods when the National Goods Year for Women is about to end, everyone Xuan Qu, led to enter and visit a week and separate,</p>

<h3 id="e207">Country of No Goods <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Jia</p>
<p>It is said that Duojiu Gong's ship sailed for many days. One day, the wind was calm and the waves were gentle. Tang Ao got up early and pointed to a piece of land in front and said, "I have been bored on the ship for days, and it is extremely boring. The food on the ship has been accumulating for a long time. If we don't reach the shore again, I am afraid it will not be enough for us to eat." So Duojiu Gong and others all leaned on the side of the ship. Lin Zhiyang asked Duojiu Gong where this was. Duojiu Gong shook his head and said, "I have traveled all over the famous seas and continents in those years, but I have never been here." Speaking of chatting, the wheel has already reached the shore, so all three of them came ashore.</p>
<p>The three walked on the shore. A man came in front, his appearance was like a Chinese person, but his clothes were very strange. The buttons were born in the center of the clothes, but the collar was turned down, the trousers were particularly long, and the shoes were also very strange, not made of silk, but made of black and hard things. Tang Ao was the first to go up, salute, and then asked, "What is your surname, sir, and what is this place called?" The man was very polite, but when he saw that they were wearing long gowns and cloth shoes, he seemed to despise them. On the one hand, he replied, "Brother Yang Hugao is just that, and my place is called the Country of No Goods. I don't know where you are from." Lin Zhiyang rushed to say, "We are Chinese, because we like to travel everywhere, so we brought Chinese goods to sell everywhere, so that we can broaden our horizons and make a few friends." The man seemed to be very happy. Tang Ao was also happy in his heart. Since this is the Country of No Goods, because he has no goods, he thinks that the goods on the ship today will definitely be sold.</p>
<p>Yang Hugao asked again, "Then what do you have?" Duojiu Gong said, "China has rouge, white powder, Huadiao, brown sugar, cloth, etc. What do you want, sir?" Who knew that Yang Hugao spit and said, "I almost took you for a fool. No one here wants these things. Do poor people even want to use rouge? Let me tell you! No one drinks Huadiao and other things. Foreign wine and white gate land are easy to promote. Speaking of clothes, the poorest people are willing to freeze to death rather than wear cloth. Look at me, a Paris satin shirt, a foreign tweed dress from Lailu, that's what you can wear. I don't have time to talk to you stubborn people, I'm going to join the preparatory meeting for promoting foreign clothes."</p>
<p>The three of them were inexplicable. They asked many people in a row, and they all said the same thing. Before they knew it, they were hungry, in a restaurant called Zhenzheng Old Brand Lailu Goods, and a piece of paper was posted on the window, which read; "If you use domestic goods to impersonate foreign goods, you will be fined 10,000 yuan." Thirteen words. Tang Ao entered the seat and asked the waiter, "I want to order Chennian Huadiao, and burn some local specialties." Who Qian waiter said, "Sir. Don't be kidding, these things can't be eaten here, or please go somewhere else!" It was still Duojiu Gong's wit, rushing to say, "Whatever you want, get some Lailu goods, and add some foreign wine! We don't understand the customs here." This made the waiter happy. Yibei said, "Do you want tea?" This time Tang Ao was also a little more obedient and said, "Is there Lailu tea? Get three cups." The waiter went happily.</p>
<p>After a while, the dishes, tea, and wine all came. Lin Zhiyang took a sip of tea and said, "It's terribly bitter." Tang Ao opened the wine bottle, but unexpectedly, there were bubbles inside, which scared the three of them and they didn't dare to eat. Speaking of dishes, instead of using chopsticks, they used forks, knives, and other things. Duojiu Gong and the other three had to grab it with their hands and eat it while the doctor was not there. Later, three pieces of bread and butter were sent up, and Lin Zhiyang felt that it was not very tasty. He didn't eat it either. The waiter took the bill, and the three of them were startled. It turned out that it was written on it.</p>
<p>After paying the money, they received a pack of chewing gum per person, which tasted not very good. The package was printed with "Four corners per piece four words. Duojiu Gong stretched out his tongue and didn't shrink back for a long time. The three of them discussed for a while, and seeing that this place was not a success, they had to go back to the ship. Lin Zhiyang bought another copy of the local newspaper. The important news contained a line of large characters; "The import of foreign goods this month reached 50 million yuan." It was noted next to it, "The national treasury is empty, and the people's wealth will be exhausted."</p>
<p>Duojiu Gong said, "The people admire foreign goods so much, how can the country not be poor, and how can the people not be poor?" Lin Zhiyang interjected, "That Yang Hugao, I know, is a homophone of foreign goods high. It can be seen that the people's psychology is general."</p>
<p>The ship of Tang Ao and the other three. It sailed again in the waves.</p>

<p>— Wang Cen</p>
<p>After a long period of struggle and enduring much hardship, Kai and Ling's love finally succeeded.</p>
<p>The two of them are now planning to live together. The first thing to solve is the housing problem. They rented a side building near Zhaofeng Park on Yuyuan Road. Opening the window, they could see lush green trees and a flat lawn. They were very satisfied with the air of this residence. They also bought some simple appliances and daily necessities, and the conditions for a small family were ready. However, at this time, there was something that made them feel very inconvenient!</p>
<p>Because although Kai and Ling both had jobs, their monthly income was only enough for their expenses, and in fact, they could no longer afford to hire someone. Moreover, they were willing to do the housework themselves to realize a frugal life. The only problem was hot water. The reason was that there was no public bathhouse near their residence, and they could not go to a distant place to bathe themselves. They borrowed the landlord's stove for cooking and boiling water during the day. Sometimes when they needed hot water at night, the fire had already gone out! Especially as the weather gradually turned cold, Kai and Ling often felt a little unhappy about not having hot water when washing their faces before going to work in the morning!</p>
<p>One day, Kai came back from outside with a paper bag and said happily to Ling:</p>
<p>(Ling, we don't have to worry about hot water anymore.)</p>
<p>(Why?) Ling asked.</p>
<p>(I just went to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to buy this.) Kai said, opening the paper bag in his hand, which turned out to be a thermos.</p>
<p>(I thought about it a long time ago, but the price of foreign goods is very expensive!) Ling said.</p>
<p>(This is a top-quality domestic Earth brand thermos. The price is very economical, and the heat preservation effect is very accurate.) Kai said with a smile.</p>
<p>(Your design is very thoughtful. You are truly my lover!) Ling kissed Kai's face.</p>
<p>From then on, they had hot water to use, whether late at night or at dawn.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: The poor girl cannot be ashamed to take up teaching; how worthy is the Western tutor to empty his heart in vain.</p>
<p>As soon as he said the two words "Let's go", he had already walked over, supporting Yueying and asking her to turn around. As she turned around, guided by Aunt Hu, she saw that the student in the blue cloth clothes was still staring at her. In her haste, she had attracted the attention of such a person, which was something she had not expected. However, she was about to take the concubine test, which was a crucial moment of success or failure, and she had no time to worry about such idle matters. When Little Ji took them to the courtyard, he had already rushed ahead to inform Jia Duocai in his room. By the time he had delivered the message, he turned around and saw that no one was behind him, and he became very anxious. So, he turned around and ran back, jumping up and down as he saw Aunt Hu and saying, "Why are you walking so slowly?" Aunt Hu pushed Yueying and said, "She is shy." Little Ji said, "Mr. Jia said that you have already talked, so what's there to be shy about? But this is good, people will find it a bit more interesting." Yueying felt that what he said was simply inhuman, but at this time, she still had to rely on him for help, so she did not dare to contradict him, but blushed and walked with her eyes lowered. When they arrived at Jia Duocai's door, Little Ji rushed forward and lifted the door curtain for them to enter. As soon as they went in, he immediately put down the curtain and stood outside himself, not going in. Jia Duocai was sitting with his legs crossed, smoking a paper cigarette. When he saw them come in, his eyes were immediately absorbed by Yueying's brand-new clothes. He couldn't help but oh and ha, as if saying that it was too beautiful, unexpectedly beautiful. Yueying followed closely behind Aunt Hu, came in, and stood by the door with her head lowered. She was shy, and Aunt Hu was also shy. She took two steps forward and then two steps back. She did not speak to Jia Duocai, but pushed Yueying's shoulder and said, "Go over there, you already know each other, why are you suddenly shy?" (88)</p>
<h3 id="e210">Winter Sacrifice at Yamen to the Song Mother of the Nation <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yun</p>
<p>The Ci Yuan Temple in Yamen, a piece of land,</p>
<p>Still mourns for the soul of the nation with lingering sorrow!</p>
<p>Among the countries that have been oppressed by foreign tribes, none is more tragic than the Zhao Song! First subjected to the trampling of Liao and Jin, and then swallowed up by the Mongol Yuan, until Lu Xiufu carried Emperor Bing into the sea, the Song Dynasty's altars of state were destroyed in the great waves. When Empress Dowager Yang received the news of her son's death, she cried in pain, saying, "I endured hardship until now, just for a piece of Zhao's flesh! Now there is no hope!" Then she jumped into the sea and died. The Empress Dowager's palace is called Ci Yuan Temple. Later generations missed the Song Dynasty, and the temple enshrines Empress Dowager Yang, the mother of the Song Dynasty, which continues to this day.</p>
<p>At that time, Zhang Shijie, the Grand Preceptor who aspired to restore the country, still wanted to fight to the death after the defeat at Gaoting, and finally, the monarch died for the country, and the minister died for the monarch. His loyalty shines through the ages. His ancestral temple is in Yamen, called Da Zhong Temple, and also enshrines Wen Tianxiang and Lu Xiufu. This continues to this day.</p>
<p>Yamen is in the vast sea south of Xinhui County. Two mountains stand like doors, and the tide ebbs and flows between them, with a magnificent landscape. After the emperors of the Song Dynasty threw themselves into the sea and died, the surviving members of the Zhao clan entered Xinhui, and their descendants are still thriving today. Last month (November 22nd) was the date of the Zhao clan's winter sacrifice to the Song Dynasty's mother of the nation in the Yamen Ci Yuan Temple. In advance, the Zhao clan members from Sanjiang Xiaolu and other villages prepared taro offerings and hired a number of civilian ships to carry the elderly Zhao clan members to the sacrifice (mourning for the Song Dynasty's mother of the nation, Yang, who died for a piece of flesh). On that day, County Magistrate Huang Huaitting, Commissioner Fan Guoyan, and President of the Xinhui Local Court Li Mingding all went to participate in the sacrificial ceremony. They crossed the sea and traveled south, and after arriving at the port, each of the officials took on the role of chief priest. County Magistrate Huang presided over the Ci Yuan Temple sacrifice, Commissioner Fan presided over the Da Zhong Temple sacrifice, and President Li presided over the sacrifice to the shrines of various righteous people who died before the restoration was completed. The ceremony was solemn, and the entire venue was solemn. The ceremony concluded at about 2 p.m., and the participants dispersed separately. As the saying goes, "Remember the past and learn from it." Now that the national humiliation is heavy and resembles the external humiliation of the Southern Song Dynasty, officials sacrificing to the Song Dynasty's mother of the nation and the shrines of the righteous people of the Da Zhong Temple can also awaken the national spirit and take the Zhao Song as a lesson. According to the Zhao clan members, "This kind of grand three-offering sacrifice was held once during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It has been almost thirty years since then, and only now is there a second grand sacrifice. If the mother of the nation knows, she will surely be grateful in heaven. It goes without saying that we clan members are moved to tears."</p>

<p>Mr. X said humorously: The young women's organization of a non-marriage alliance is a new form of closedism!

What a clever art! Why wouldn't everyone be happy to do it?</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Tragedy of Actors <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Zi</p>
<p>The name of the famous actor in the theater is written in large gold letters on the sign, and many electric lights are installed on all sides. Every night, there are horses, carriages, and flowing crowds, and everyone is vying to listen to his performance. Enquire about his performance fee, and it is at least two or three thousand yuan a month. In the eyes of the general public, it seems that they should live luxuriously and comfortably, but who knows that this is not the case!</p>
<p>There is a civil and military old actor with a performance fee of two thousand yuan a month. He is the top performer in the theater. He has no hobbies and does not fool around outside. Who knows that he is always in debt! When he really has no other choice, he has to send entire boxes of costumes to the pawnshop! What is the reason for this after all? It turns out that he was idle for ten months before this performance, so he was short more than five thousand yuan. This time he is performing, he must first repay his debts. In addition, he owes five or six thousand to the costume shop. Moreover, the so-called famous actor needs to provide for the families of the musicians, drummers, and supporting actors in martial arts performances, a total of ten or so families, relying on this famous actor to provide. Since he is the top performer, he cannot be sloppy with his costumes. A coat costs eighty yuan, and a python robe costs one hundred and twenty. Each month, adding new costumes costs at least three to five hundred yuan. For all these reasons, although he is earning such a large performance fee, he is always living on the verge of bankruptcy!</p>
<p>This civil and military old actor has a quirk. No matter how difficult things are at home, when he sees something he loves, he must spend money to buy it back. During the January 28th Incident, the theater where he was performing burned down, and all the servants at home were eating pancakes every day. Finally, a certain celebrity gave him one hundred yuan. Logically, he should go back and buy rice and firewood! Who knows that the old man was carrying one hundred yuan in his arms, walked past an antique shop, saw a precious sword that could cut iron like mud, and he had to buy it. He spent eighty yuan to buy the sword home, and his family had to continue to starve. Because he has this kind of temperament, no matter if his performance fee is increased to eighteen thousand, his economic situation will never improve!</p>
<p>Another Tan-style old actor is young, but he has taken up opium smoking. It is said that because old Tan used to smoke opium, if those who learn from him do not smoke, their singing will not be flavorful enough. This is certainly his excuse, but in the singing profession, there are really quite a few comrades in the underworld. The more years they have, the greater their opium addiction. If they ever fall out of favor, their performance fee drops, or they are idle for a year and a half, that will be the end of them!</p>

<p>When I saw barbers and masseuses on Sichuan Road, at first I mistakenly thought they were gilded medical doctors and nurses, because they were all wearing white coats outside their clothes.</p>
<p>The owner of the building opposite my residence used the national flag of the party-state as a door curtain. Perhaps he did not intend to insult the national flag of the party-state, but was the only believer in the Kuomintang. Otherwise, why would he even ask it to supervise when making little citizens? That is how I feel.</p>
<p>Once, my close relative surnamed Li, who was very honest, got married. On the way to the banquet, I mistakenly remembered Wangping Street Fuxing as Pingwang Street Xingyuan. I didn't realize it until I had eaten half of the feast, because it just so happened that this family was also surnamed Li.</p>

<h3 id="e215">On Oranges <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Mengjiao</p>
<p>The orange is an evergreen shrub, cultivated in the Jianghuai area of China, as well as in the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang. The trunk is over ten feet tall, with white flowers blooming in autumn and bearing fruit in early winter, with colors ranging from yellow to green. It is full of sweet liquid, which is sweet and refreshing to eat. Su Dongpo's poem to Liu Jingwen says, "When lotus leaves have withered and lost their sheltering shade, Chrysanthemums still flaunt their frost-defying sprays. Remember well this finest time of year; When oranges turn yellow and tangerines turn green.” I feel that in this season, I cannot help but write about this wonderful fruit, so I present this discourse on oranges.</p>
<p>Previous scholars have written extensively on chrysanthemums, crabs, peonies, and the like, but only a few have written about oranges. Only Han Yanzhi of the Song Dynasty wrote three volumes on oranges. Yanzhi was from Yan'an, the eldest son of Zhongwu, King Shizhong. He passed the imperial examination in the tenth year of Shaoxing and became a scholar of the Longtu Pavilion. This book was written when he was the prefect of Wenzhou during the Chunxi period. The first volume contains eight varieties of tangerines, one variety of oranges, with the milk tangerine of Nishan at the top. The middle volume contains eighteen varieties of oranges. The last volume speaks of methods of planting. Later, Chen Jingyi's "Quan Fang Bei Zu" also touched on oranges, but it was not a dedicated work.</p>
<p>Both tangerines and oranges belong to the citrus family, but they are not exactly the same. However, they are often mixed up. For example, in Fujian, they are called tangerines, while in Guangdong, they are called sweet oranges, and honey oranges are called tangerines. Therefore, there is a saying, "Tall oranges, flat tangerines," as detailed in the Xinhui Zhi. In fact, tangerines are yellowish-red, while oranges are pure yellow. Tangerine peel is fine and tight, and difficult to peel, while orange peel is rough and easy to peel. Tangerines are sweet, while oranges are sour. There are differences between them.</p>
<p>The best oranges are produced in Zhejiang, not Fujian, and Yongjia in Zhejiang is the best. The "Qun Fang Pu" says, "Oranges from Suzhou, Taizhou, west from Jingzhou, and south from Fujian, Guangdong, and Fuzhou, are all not as good as Wenzhou." The "Oujiang Yi Zhi" says, "Yongjia is suitable for oranges, and the leaves are upright, as Ye Zhengze's poem says, 'There are orange trees in every forest, and lotus flowers in every water.'" Their flavor is extremely sweet, with those without seeds being the best.</p>
<p>Nishan is in Pingyang County, only three or two miles long, and is famous for producing milk tangerines. The "Qun Fang Pu" says that the tangerines of Nishan taste like milk, hence the name. Its trees are graceful, its branches are slender, its flowers are fragrant, its fruits are round and upright, its skin is like glazed wax, its size is six or seven inches, its skin is thin and its flavor is precious, its veins do not stick to the segments, and it leaves no residue when eaten. One fruit has only two or three seeds, and some have none at all. When broken open, a fragrant mist sprays out, making it the best among tangerines.</p>
<p>The "Quan Fang Fo Zu" distinguishes five varieties of oranges: orange, pomelo, fragrant pomelo, kumquat, and trifoliate orange. Oranges produced in Xinhui, Guangdong are the best, which are commonly known as Xinhui oranges. Its top has a pattern like a circle, which the locals often use to distinguish authenticity.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, an orange official was established in Jiaozhi to manage the tribute of imperial oranges. During the Wu and Yue periods, an orange register was established again. Wu Ji Ze said, "Please remove my orange register," as seen in "Shu Yi Ji."</p>
<p>The orange fruit has fibrous tissue, winding around the peel, which is called orange fiber. Both the peel and the fiber of the orange can be used in medicine.</p>
<p>There are also smoked oranges, which the "Ju Lu" says: "If the orange shows damage, then remove the peel, place the flesh segments in the space, and smoke it with fire, called smoked orange. Soak it in sugar and honey, and its taste is even better."</p>
<p>The cultivation of oranges attaches great importance to soil quality. If the soil flavor is different, even transplanting good seeds will be useless. Therefore, Yan Zi said that if an orange grows in Huainan, it will be an orange, but if it grows in Huaibei, it will be a trifoliate orange. The leaves are similar, but the taste is different. Now, when we say that relocation is not good, we often say "oranges that have crossed the Huai River," which is where the meaning comes from.</p>
<p>There are many good poems about oranges. Ye Shi's "Orange Branch Song" says, "Honey fills the room, gold for skin, short days in people's homes hang sparse fences, judge frost and cut dew to load the boat, don't sing 'Yang Branch Song,' sing 'Orange Branch Song.'" Su Zhe's poem "Gui Jun Sends Warm Tangerines" says, "The yellow tangerines of Chu Mountain are small as bullets, I have not seen the three-inch tangerines of Dongting, if there were no elegant guests from Wu and Yue, who would send them thousands of miles to the south of the Yangtze River?" Sentence fragments such as Fang Weng's "Green buds and leaves pluck new oranges," Zheng Yuanyou's "Ripe oranges, yellow fragrance presses the branches low," and You Wenjing's "Oceans, western winds, oranges, and pomelos are fragrant" are all charming and lovely.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Records of Fleeting Incense <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Tongzhi was the eighth emperor of the Qing Dynasty, and he was the Empress Dowager's own son. Unfortunately, this little emperor died too early. He only lived for nineteen years before dying of a severe case of smallpox. This was naturally very heartbreaking for the Empress Dowager!</p>
<p>Although Tongzhi occupied such a short period of time, he could not be said to have made any contributions to the country's economy or people's livelihood. Even his literary and military talents must have been very limited. However, his relics have been collected quite a lot, far exceeding those of his poor father, Emperor Xianfeng. Perhaps this is because he was still a child, and he liked everything, and he already owned a large part of treasures and supplies during his lifetime, so he left so many behind after his death. Or perhaps it was not like this, but because the Empress Dowager loved him too much, and could not bear to let him be forgotten because he had not accomplished anything, so she took extra care to collect his relics and send them to these ancient palaces, hoping to let him borrow the power of these things to win an immortal name.</p>
<p>When she arrived at this palace, the Empress Dowager had transformed into a compassionate mother full of sorrow. The first thing that caught her eye was a square glass box. Inside was a small bowl made of pure gold, with a very light style. Although it was gold, it would not look heavy at all. It was also engraved with many delicate patterns and auspicious words. This was the rice bowl that Tongzhi used during his lifetime. Stored with this rice bowl was a small silver scale. In those days, the Empress Dowager used this scale to personally prepare food for Tongzhi every day, so as to prevent him from eating too much or not enough.</p>
<p>In another larger glass box, we also saw a small dragon robe that Tongzhi wore when he was on the throne. (198)</p>

<h3 id="e217">National Labor Exhibition Closed Yesterday <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Judging Committee Made General Observations</p>
<p>The National Vocational School and Primary and Secondary School Labor Course Achievement Exhibition closed yesterday. Sixteen members of the Achievement Judging Committee, including Zhong Daochang, went to the exhibition hall on the 12th to observe the achievements displayed in each hall to make general observations. Because there were still guests from all walks of life visiting on that day, it was inconvenient to judge. From the morning of the 13th, the committee members began to review the achievements of each hall. In addition to the other fourteen members who were separately assigned to preside over the review of a certain type of achievement, Yang Zhensheng and Zhuang Zexuan, who were well-versed in educational research, were asked to make general criticisms from an educational perspective. Although the conference had a chief judging committee member (Gu Shusen) and the responsible divisions and sections (section chiefs Zhong Daozan, Dai Yingguan, and Wu Yan) and attendees (counselor Chen Panzao and supervisor Gu Zhaojun), they all participated in the meeting due to their educational administrative relationships. They did not participate in the judging of achievements and did not recommend a judging leader or chief judge. However, after the review was completed, the judging committee members held another closing meeting to compile a report of comments on the results of the review.</p>
<h3 id="e218">National Labor Exhibition Comments <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The National Labor Exhibition closed yesterday. The criticisms of the visitors have been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. Here are a few more excerpts below.</p>
<p>I hope that the labor exhibition will be held every three years, like the "Bazaar Malam" in the South Seas Islands. I hope that at the next meeting, please specify the production methods in more detail so that visitors can truly gain knowledge and ability and be able to do it themselves without difficulty when they return. I hope that the government will set up a craft institute so that general teachers, small workers, and small traders can go to study the knowledge they need so that they can teach students and make goods to trade.) Chen Yusheng) The display of products should be on one side for easy viewing. (Zhu Meihua) Promoting labor education is the most progressive phenomenon in education. However, we believe that no matter what, handicrafts are always difficult to compete with foreign goods. However, in China at present, this cannot be avoided. We hope that at the next labor exhibition, we can see more machine industries.) Hu Oufeng) Hard work is enough to revitalize the country. The purpose of holding the National Labor Exhibition is to promote labor education. However, I see that there are many achievements made in leisure, and I return disappointed. (Qian Benming) It can be said that the items related to light industry listed in the entire venue are all available, which shows that our country, which is vast in land and rich in resources, should have unlimited manpower to be used. Even if the manpower of this achievement product is used as a part of the national defense resources, it is enough to chill the enemy's courage. Therefore, I hope that all of us in the country will pay attention to the application and concentration of these forces, especially our young people, who should pay more attention to the forging and storage of these forces. Then, in the future, if we expand and enlarge them, how can we not see the tyrannical island barbarians finally prostrating themselves before us? It is more than just wiping out the humiliation of the past. (Liu Shengwu) The Labor Exhibition is the pioneer in promoting production education. However, the government authorities should urge children to pay attention to the improvement of rural undertakings and the training of skills. (Zhang Han) I hope that work will be useful so that we who study work can truly go to the factory to do well. This meeting must be meaningful, not like the general one, which is completed after it is opened. The vocational education fee should account for 80%. (He Hongjun) After seeing this Labor Exhibition, I am even more convinced that China is still in the stage of handicraft production. The only reason, of course, is the economic aggression of imperialism. Therefore, if we do not overthrow the production that is invading China, we can only stay here forever. To be honest, China was already able to produce these products 300 years ago. (Ji Zhongpu) Gathering the labor exhibitions of primary and secondary schools across the country to promote vocational education and increase children's abilities is a matter of urgent need for production today. Looking at the entire achievements, the lacquerware from Fujian and the porcelain from Jiangxi are the most outstanding. The rest are not without luck, but there are too many similarities. I hope that in the future, the labor of each school can pay attention to the local specialties and teach production. This move is not only convenient for labor, but also can promote the specialties of the local area. (Shen Mo) The achievements of this National Labor Exhibition look like a lot, but there are very few practical ones. It focuses on cities and ignores the countryside. What item is something that farmers need? However, in terms of national defense ideological training, there should be no shortage of people who pay attention. Although the various educational institutions across the country have spent huge sums of money, it is still worth it. (Dangtu Education Visiting Group) (1) This Labor Exhibition is really worth seeing, but it is questionable whether there are any teachers and workers who made many exquisite works on behalf of them. (2) All labor should be based on local production, and it is hoped that no raw materials from other countries or other provinces will be taken. (3) It is hoped that the political and educational authorities will do their best to promote it and send special personnel to guide and investigate it. Attention should be paid to the achievements of group labor, and do not let a few people be representatives. (Huang Shaoxi) There are too few aspects of pharmaceuticals and pharmacy. (Chen Xuchu) The importance of promoting vocational labor education in our country is no less important than physical education. However, the public opinion circles have particularly expanded publicity for physical education, such as the National Games, etc., while the publicity for this unprecedented Labor Exhibition is very bland, and even has not paid attention to it at all. The difference is like heaven and earth. This is really amazing. In the past, education has indeed gone astray, and it should be corrected in the future, and the public opinion circles should stand on the front line to make correct leadership and corrections. (Liu Shenzhan) The people of the north preserve the spirit of perseverance, and the people of the south have the purity of excellence. (Chen Kuodao) Looking at the various halls, the waterwheel invented by Gu Gengfu of Huaiyin Agricultural School in Jiangsu is the most practical. When the voice of rural revival is singing high, Gu's invention can meet the mission of the times. In the future, it seems that emphasis should be placed on practical aspects, so that school education and social needs can be integrated. (Shen Shuchen) The labor achievements are considerable. If we talk about the whole country, it is a pity that there are no achievements in the three northeastern provinces. (Cao Mingzhao) Sichuan is located in a border area, and the situation is chaotic. Speaking of vocational education, it is really unworthy. For the advanced provinces, I dare not make any criticisms. I only hope that the compatriots of the whole country will help the people of Sichuan to eliminate all evil obstacles. Then the day when we can follow in the footsteps of the provinces is coming. From my humble opinion, the exhibits of the provinces should be promoted to Fujian. (Huang Shuxuan) This time, the works seem to be biased towards vocational schools, and there are very few in middle and primary schools, which is a pity. (Peng Shuangling) I hope that scientific instruments will be promoted more in the future. (Zhu Zhengyuan) The purpose of the labor course is to cultivate students' labor habits and production skills, and to develop their novel ideas. On the surface of the exhibits in this exhibition, although the excellence is not comparable to that of major factories, in education, it has been able to show its considerable value and attention. If the authorities can give extra promotion and encouragement in the future, then the future results will be very amazing. (Lu Qiushi) Laborers must pay good attention to economy. If a lot of money is spent, the true meaning of labor will be lost. (Xia Zuyan) The achievements of the school are like factory manufacturing, which is really amazing and praised. It is hoped that it will gradually improve and promote vocational education. (Jin Dingyi) The most meaningful of the models are maps of lost territory in China, new rural children's parks, national defense units, and the cleanliness of diet and living, which are of great benefit to the promotion of the new life and the enhancement of national meaning (Shang Zhi) I hope to set up a permanent display place so that it can be visited and borrowed from time to time, and it will be very beneficial. (He Hongjun) Jiangxi porcelain, various children's toys, should have a unified method to promote sales throughout the country. Nowadays, various stores are filled with foreign porcelain, so those who love to use domestic goods, even if they want to buy domestic goods, feel a sigh in every corner, which is very regrettable. (Fang Wenfo) In the midst of the phenomenon of internal and external troubles and national depression, we should pay urgent attention to scientific works and efforts. This time, the achievements of various works are mostly in the form of artistic guards, which seems to be a flaw. (Gao Shilian)</p>

<h3 id="e221">Provisional Meeting of the Sino-Polish Cultural Association <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Welcoming Honorary Presidents</p>
<p>Farewell to Polish Members</p>
<p>The Sino-Polish Cultural Association held a provisional tea party at its office at 5 pm on the 11th to welcome honorary presidents Cai Yuanpei and Wu Zhihui, and to bid farewell to Polish members Wieraszki and Wit-Norski returning to their country. Those present included honorary president Cai Yuanpei (Wu Zhihui sent a letter saying that he could not attend due to a cold), as well as members Okinczyc and his wife, Wieraszki, Wit-Norski (Polish members), Yuan Xiayi, Chen Shaokang, Yu Binglie, Guo Youshou, Xie Shoukang, Zhang Yuanchang, Tang Yiren, Chen Yaodong, Chu Anping, Lei Zhen, Hu Tieyan, Chen Jianxiu, Li Jiaxiang, Huang Jianzhong, Xie Jianhua, Tang Xueyong, Guo Lianfeng, Yuan Junmu, Wu Shuchang, Xu Beihong, Liu Hou, Liao Jianan, Xiong Wenmin, Zhang Shuqi, Jiang Biwei, Zhang Tong, Zhai Junqian, Gao Chengyuan, Li Shengwu, Hang Liewu, Li Jingbi, Dai Ce, Peng Xuepei, (Chinese members), and more than thirty others. First, Director Xie Shoukang gave a speech, stating that the establishment of the association was deeply indebted to the guidance and support of the two honorary presidents, Cai Zimin and Wu Zhihui, but because the two gentlemen were not often in Nanjing, the members of the association had few opportunities to receive their teachings in person. Today, Mr. Wu was unable to come due to a cold, but Mr. Cai personally came to the meeting to give guidance. Mr. Cai is a leading figure in the academic world and needs no introduction. On behalf of the members, I express my welcome and gratitude. But today there is also a report, that is, the Polish members of the association, Mr. Wit-Norski and Mr. Wieraszki, will soon return to their hometowns. We take this tea party as an opportunity to bid farewell. The two gentlemen have been very enthusiastic about the association's affairs, and the association relies on them deeply. Hearing that their departure is near is deeply regrettable. Now, I will introduce the brief histories of the two gentlemen, Wei and Wei. The two gentlemen are young Polish scientists with a very promising future. Both were born in 1905, Wei was from Wołow and Wei was from Krakow. Both studied at the world-renowned Krakow University. In 1930, Wei obtained a doctorate in medicine from Wołow University, and Wei obtained two doctoral degrees in medicine from Poznań University a year earlier. During their studies, they represented the Medical Student Federation and went to Romania, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Czech Republic, and other countries to connect with students from various countries and promote the exchange of students to promote mutual understanding and cultural exchange between countries. The two gentlemen also have very rich medical experience. Wei Min served as an obstetrician at Wołow University Hospital and a doctor at the Krakow Infectious Disease Hospital, and also served as a government doctor in the Polish-Russian border area. Wei Shi served as a surgeon at Wołow University Hospital, a doctor at the Krakow Infectious Disease Hospital, and a doctor at the largest mental hospital in Poland (with 1,500 beds). Both Wei and Wei have traveled to the UK and the US. The two gentlemen share the same ideals and have consistent standpoints and opinions in science. They are both enthusiastic about researching medical psychology, and pay special attention to various issues of psychopathology. In order to study the relationship between social conditions and psychopathology, they decided to come to Asia to conduct on-site investigation and experimentation. In June 1932, they departed from Poland, passing through Romania, Russia, Turkey, to reach Persia. They stayed in Persia for seven months and were allowed by the King of Persia to establish a clinic in Siraz. Because they could speak Persian, they were able to approach the Persian people. From Persia, they took a car to India, passing through the southern Iranian plateau and the Balochistan desert. They traveled in India for five months, visiting mental hospitals, studying the system of religion and philosophy, and learning about the outline of old-fashioned medicine. Then they passed through Ceylon, Penang, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, to reach Shanghai, in June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. At first, they contacted the Chinese Medical Association, and then served as a psychiatrist at the Suzhou Mental Hospital for one month. Starting this year, the Examination Yuan hired Mr. Wit-Norski as the chief medical officer of the Health Department of the Yuan, and Wieraszki as a health consultant. Wei Shi traveled north for three months and worked in the neurology department of the Xiehe Hospital for several weeks, and visited the ophthalmology hospital of the Polish Church in Shunde Prefecture. Wei Shi accompanied President Dai Jitao and the Panchen to Hangzhou in the summer. Now, when the two gentlemen leave Nanjing for North China this week and go to Japan and the Americas for about half a year before returning to Poland to work in mental hospitals, in addition to the two members' grand tour around the world, it is hoped that they will bring back goodwill towards the association and China, promote the purpose of the association in Poland, and help as much as possible. At this time of farewell, I cannot help but feel reluctant. I wish the two gentlemen a safe journey. Then Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, briefly saying that he had participated in many works during the preparation of this meeting, and today he participated in this grand meeting and bid farewell to Wei and Wei, which is very happy. The association has already achieved a certain scale for the work of communication between Chinese and Polish cultures, and plans to have various publications and lecture plans, which is very rare. There are many things to be done in the future, and we should do our best to develop the cultural undertakings of the association. Then Wieraszki replied, saying that he was very happy to participate in today's event. The comrades came to China for a year and a half, not for business or office, but for the purpose of studying psychopathology. Living here for a long time, I feel that the Chinese nation is upright and peaceful, and its temperament is great. It nurtures a long-standing culture. With the strength of the Chinese people, it will contribute greatly to the world culture in the future. Although Poland is a newly emerging country, it also pays great attention to the promotion of cultural and academic undertakings. With this meeting, mutual assistance or a slight effort can be made. I am very grateful for the grand intentions of today's gathering. Then Wit-Norski said that various international organizations now have the purpose of eliminating world wars and seeking world peace. Although this association may not have such great power, but if we treat each other with sincerity, we can at least increase the degree of mutual understanding between the two countries, and seek the communication of culture between the two countries, which will indirectly contribute to the maintenance of world peace. The guests and hosts chatted happily over tea and snacks until after 7 pm before the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>The Hongying Library was established by industrialist Ye Hongying with donations to inherit the Renwen Library. Since the establishment of the preparatory office on Avenue Joffre, it has been actively preparing and sparing no effort. The current collection of books has reached more than 50,000 volumes, and the collection of other historical materials is even richer. The library has now reached an agreement with Yan Fuqing to rent the remaining land of the original Chinese football field on Labor Father Road to build a library building. Various construction plans and drawings have been drafted and construction will begin soon. It is expected to be completed next summer so that it can be officially opened.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Regular Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Ling Zhuming Lectures on the Yuehan Railway Project</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers held the first regular meeting of the 23rd year at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 7 pm on the 8th. More than 40 people attended. After the gathering, Xu Peihuang, the former president, reported on the financial situation of the branch. Yan Liping and Qiu Xieyun were designated to review the report. Then the new staff of this session was held. As a result, Xu Shanxiang was elected as the president, Wang Shengshan as the vice president, Shi Konghuai as the secretary, and Feng Baoling as the accountant. However, Shi Konghuai resigned due to personal affairs, and now Xu Mingcai will be appointed to replace him. Secondly, the general association is currently raising donations to purchase materials and testing equipment. Please help the branch to help. Then, the new president was invited to preside over the speech, and then the preparatory committee for the New Year's Friendship Conference was designated. Wang Shengshan was the director of the preparatory committee, Feng Baoling and Zhu Shuyi were the deputy directors of the preparatory committee, and Jin Zhixuan, Huang Yan, Yang Ximou, Xue Cixin, Xu Peihuang, Lu Chengzhang and others were the directors of each sub-group. Then, Ling Zhuming, director of the Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau of the Yuehan Railway, was invited to lecture on the engineering situation of the section. He briefly said that the Yuehan Railway has a history of 38 years. The northern section is the Xiang'e Road, built with British loans, 417 kilometers long. The southern section is the Guanshao Road, built by the Yuehan Railway Company, 224 kilometers long. The section from Shaozhou to Zhuzhou is more than 450 kilometers long and has been suspended for 15 years. In the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Railways planned to use the British Boxer Indemnity to complete this road, and first built the section from Shaozhou to Lechang, which is 51 kilometers long, with funds raised by the Ministry. It was completed in August 22nd. At the same time, it borrowed the British Boxer Indemnity to build the section from Lechang to Zhuzhou. Detailed measures have also been negotiated. It is estimated that 1.66 million pounds of Boxer Indemnity will be used for purchasing materials in the UK, and 31 million yuan of national currency will be used for labor and material costs in the country. The section is 407 kilometers long. The engineering bureau is located in Hengzhou, and the project is divided into seven general teams, a total of 21 teams, with a total of more than 58,000 workers. It will proceed in three directions from Lechang to the north, Hengzhou to the south, and Zhuzhou to the south. It was originally scheduled to complete the entire section of the project in April 26th, and later changed to the end of 25th. According to the current situation, it is expected that the entire line can be opened to traffic in the summer of 25th. The maximum slope of the section is set at 1.285%, which is the smallest curve of 240 meters compared to the 1.5% used by the Pinghan and Longhai railways. The section has a total of 16 tunnels, the longest is more than 400 meters, and the shortest is about 100 meters. There are three large iron bridges with a maximum span of 60 meters. There are many copper-reinforced concrete arch bridges with spans ranging from 30 meters to 40 meters. The section passes through many mountains, the terrain is steep, and transportation is difficult. At the same time, the road is relatively remote, and it is not easy to find contractors. After the workers have been found, the issues of accommodation and food are particularly difficult, and the bureau is trying to solve them. The section uses 85-pound steel rails. The design of the bridge is based on the Kubal E500 combat weight. Part of the sleepers are supplied by Canada and part by Australia. All have been treated with preservatives. In the future, Hunan may be able to supply a part of pine and fir. After each section of the project is completed, it will be opened to traffic immediately. It has been stipulated to use 484 locomotives, with a load capacity of Kubal E37.5. The bridge load capacity of Xiang'e Road is Kubal E40, and Guanshao Road is E45. Therefore, the locomotives that have been determined can be used throughout the Yuehan Road in the future. The determined vehicles are 40-ton steel cars. Hunan produces coal and rice, which can be supplied to Guangche after the opening of traffic. The economic development prospects are unlimited. After the lecture, the members praised Ling Jun as the former director of the Lingtong Section Engineering Bureau of the Longhai Railway, who has achieved outstanding results. This time, he is in charge of the most great, most important, and most difficult project of the Zhushao Section, and he is able to handle it with ease. Among the railway construction engineers in our country, there are Zhan Tianyou, who built the PingSui Railway, and Ling Zhuming, who is currently building the Longhai Railway and the Yuehan Railway. They all expressed their respect and asked detailed questions and discussions with great interest. The meeting ended after 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Recent News from Suyan City Senior Vocational School</p>
<p>Since Jiangsu Provincial Yancheng Middle School was reorganized into an Applied Chemistry program this semester, there have been significant improvements in equipment and curriculum. At a time when production education is being promoted, the recent situation of the school is presumably of great interest to the public. A brief overview is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Three-Year Plan Drafted: Since being ordered to establish the Applied Chemistry program, the school immediately began drafting a three-year plan. The main subjects of this plan are the production of refined salt and the electrolysis of salt. Yancheng is located by the sea and is originally a salt-producing area, making the production of refined salt and the electrolysis of salt most suitable. In addition to the electrolysis of salt, which can produce caustic soda, bleaching powder, hydrochloric acid, and magnesium carbonate, the school also plans to focus on brewing as a subsidiary subject, engaging in the production of wine, soy sauce, MSG, and other products. Recently, Principal Wu of the school, in order to enrich the equipment and facilitate student practice, has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for approval to allocate a large sum of money to build a factory in the second semester of this year for analytical testing and manufacturing purposes. On the other hand, he suggested that students from all chemical vocational schools in the province should rotate and exchange practical experience, so as to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their own weaknesses. It is said that this suggestion has been sympathized with by various schools.</p>
<p>(2) Holding Scientific Lectures: In order to increase students' interest in science, the school held a scientific lecture on December 1st. The topics were determined by the teachers, and the students were allowed to choose their own speakers. In addition to two representatives from each grade, there was also enthusiastic participation from those who volunteered. It is said that during the lecture, each speaker elaborated in detail and was very engaging.</p>
<p>In addition, the school is vigorously implementing the New Life Movement. All classrooms, dormitories, and public places are cleaned by the entire faculty and students in designated areas after breakfast to cultivate students' work habits. Other aspects, such as student etiquette and language, are also examined at any time. The whole school spirit is quite uplifted.</p>

<h3 id="e234">After Seven Consecutive Days of Declines, Gold Bar Prices Slightly Rebound <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Customs Gold Unit Shrinks, Pressure Still Present</p>
<p>Struggles Result in a Slight Improvement of Three Cents</p>
<p>The gold market has been falling sharply for days, and yesterday it finally rebounded slightly. Although sentiment showed a rebound, short sellers slightly covered their positions. However, because many parties were still settling their positions, large players continued to exert pressure, and the situation in the first half of the day was very tense. Swaps are urgent, and floating longs should be gradually liquidated. The remaining buyers are probably well prepared, and the trend may temporarily stabilize. It was found that in the early morning, the overseas silver market rose in both the UK and the US, and the forward silver market rebounded by 4.5 cents. Exchange rates shrank slightly, and London spot gold was stable, so sentiment was still stable. In off-market preparatory transactions, the opening price once rose to 70 yuan and some odd cents. It was rumored that the central bank's listed Customs Gold Unit would shrink by 2 cents, and although it fell to 67 yuan, it still rebounded. However, sentiment had already been startled, and the opening was even lower in the morning. The central bank's listed exchange rates were announced: the British pound rose by 1.25, and the US dollar rose by 1.875. The Customs Gold Unit plummeted by 1.5 cents, and the standard gold bar price also fell to 1,003.2 yuan. Sentiment was greatly frightened, and a selling frenzy began. After the opening, it immediately fell to 64.5 yuan. However, sentiment rebounded at the low, and large players bought in unison. After that, buyers actively moved in, gradually pulling up the price, which actually rebounded to beyond the 70 yuan mark. Sassoon aggressively offered shillings, and the HSBC exchange rates also rose by 1.25 for the British pound and 1.875 for the US dollar. They took advantage of the high to supply sources and fell back. Large short players, such as Tongfengheng and Yuanyi, aggressively sold bars, frequently exerting pressure, and fell again after the rise. However, foreign short-term financing loosened, and sentiment had calmed down. Those who maintained the low price were very strong. The silver equalization tax was announced unchanged, still levying 6.75%. The British exchange rate was calculated at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 65625. After that, the situation returned to stability, and in-market transactions were in greater demand than supply, gradually rising to beyond 70 yuan. The exchange market was slightly tight, and sentiment was originally good, so the upward trend started again. However, those who supplied at high prices became more active, and after the high, prices gradually fell. Sassoon still had a selling appetite, floating longs wavered, and large players also cut their long positions. There was once a correction, but the exchange market had settled down and was difficult to change. After a low, there were buyers, and transactions were small. Although there was another rise, Yuanyi sold bars again, and the situation at noon settled down. It was a small rebound after seven consecutive days of declines. The total number of lots was more than 28,000. Now, the market situation in the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 966 yuan, down 3.7 yuan from the previous close. During the first session, supply and demand were balanced, and the price hovered around 6 yuan. Then, because the central bank's listed exchange rates were officially announced, the British pound rose by 1.25, the US dollar rose by 1.875, and the Customs Gold Unit plummeted by 1.5 cents, sentiment was greatly frightened. Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, Shunmao, and Tianfeng sold bars, and the price fell from 6.8 yuan to 4.5 yuan. However, because sentiment showed a rebound, Yuli, Tongfu, Qianchangxiang, Xiangfeng, Fuchang, Hengyu, Dafa, Yongshen, Kangrui, Xingyu, Xindakang, and others bought bars one after another. In addition, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Xingyongfu, and Yu also went in and out. Although there were fluctuations along the way, the buying spree was strong, gradually rising to 71 yuan. Knowing in advance that the HSBC exchange rates were up 1.25 for the British pound and 1.875 for the US dollar, Dafa and Yongdingtai took advantage of the high price to sell, retreating to 69.6 yuan. Hengyu, Shunmao, Qianchang, Xiangfu, Changdafa, and Yong also advanced, and the price rose back to 70.09 yuan. Sassoon continued to aggressively offer February shillings at 6875, and sentiment was still stable. Under the continuous supply of bars from Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yong, Zhaofeng, Changtong, Fengheng, and others, the price fell to 67.8 yuan. Huabi took a positive position on January US dollars at 3125, and Dadecheng and Fuan bought at low prices, rising to 9.2 yuan. However, because Yuanyi worked hard to sell bars, it still fell to 8.1 yuan. Huashang settled January US dollars at 3125, and the Silver Company settled the same month at 375. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged. After that, Qingyu, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongfutai, Hengrichang, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and others bought in unison, and the price rose to 72.3 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Dalian Gang, and Fuyu took advantage of the high price to sell, falling to zero and some odd cents. At this time, Fuxing and Yongfuyu were still advancing, and the price once rose to 1.5 yuan. However, Sassoon again offered March shillings at 3121, and Qingyu and Hengxingyuan sold off, retreating to 68.2 yuan. Although retail investors were still bidding up, rising to 9.5 yuan, Shunmao, Renfa, and Yongfuan sold again, and the price fell further to 7 yuan. The banks repeatedly vomited out. Yifeng, Yong, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Shunmao, and Dadecheng bought in unison at low prices, and after entering, the price rose back to 71.7 yuan. Yuanyi, Yifeng, Yong, Yongli, Yuanchangyong, and others sold out, causing the price to fall below 70 yuan, to 69.8 yuan. The noon closing was 970 yuan. After the closing, Dadecheng, Fuxing, and Yongchu advanced, but Yuanyi, Dingtai, Hengyu, and Qianchangxiang were still selling, gradually falling. It was found that the highest price in the first half of the day was 972.3 yuan, and the lowest price was 964.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 7.8 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 3 cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was retreated to 1,003.2 yuan, according to the Central Bank's standard gold bar price. According to the closing price, it was about 33 yuan, less than 8 yuan less than the previous close. The January account was 970 yuan, and the morning water supplement was 961 yuan. Red gold was still 1 yuan lower than the standard gold bar price, and the listed price was 965 yuan. The spot market was quiet and still lacked formal transactions. Tianjin was also at the same price as the futures standard. Apart from the arrival of more than 3,000 taels of East goods yesterday, there was no news today. The batch of red gold was mostly contacted with banks for mortgages. The trend of this swap ultimately resulted in the long side paying out 10 yuan, and the swap price will depend on whether foreign short-term financing and funds ease.</p>
<p>In-market transactions were chaotic. Although large short players made up their positions on the right, at the same time, those who continued to exert pressure made great efforts. In summary, Yuanyi, Tongfengheng, Dachangxiang, Chunyuan, Yongyifeng, Yongyichengchang, Dayuan, Maoyong, Fuxing, Wanxing, and Shunli were on the selling side. Zhaofengchang, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Hongxing, Tianfeng, Yongshenchang, Yongshunmao, and Jinlong were on the selling side. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and Dafa Yong came out first and then advanced, and Yifengyong, Qianchangxiang advanced first and then came out. The Dalian Gang and Wanxing did a total of more than 900, rolling out about 400. Shunli did 500 and some odd, rolling out more than 100. The Guanggang Shengsheng and Daxing had few ins and outs. The total number of transactions on the day was 40,355.</p>
<p>January Futures Lineup: On the long side, Zhengchang had less than 1,600, Senchangyong had less than 1,900, Yuanmaoyong had more than 1,500, Shenkang had 100 each, Fuchang had 1,000, Dachangxiang, Changsheng, and Yong each had more than 900, Bingxing and Shunmao each had more than 800, Zhaofengchang and Jinlong each had more than 700, Tianfeng, Yingxiang, Yuanda, and Yongwu Changxiang each had more than 600, Chunyuanyong, Yongli, Hengxingsheng, and Da each had more than 500, Juchang had more than 400, Runchangyuyi Shengyongheng and Dafa Yongchang and Da Hengtai Lifeng and Dakangyong each had more than 300, Dafeng and Tianfengyong had more than 200, Yuan Maohouchang Yongyuli each had more than 200.

<h3 id="e235">American Exchange Rate: Seemingly Relaxed, Actually Tight <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>First, Sassoon Continues to Sell</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches from London, demand bills rose 1.25, long US dollar bills rose 1.25, and forward silver prices in Montreaux also rose 4.5%. The price of raw gold in London remained unchanged, the British exchange rate against the US narrowed by 3.75, the US exchange rate against the British narrowed by 8.75, and the British exchange rate against the French fell by 12 points. The US exchange rate against the French remained unchanged. The opening price of the current-term exchange rate market this morning saw British currency at one shilling, four pence, and nine three seven five, and the US currency at thirty-four yuan, nine three seven five, not much different from the previous closing price. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed a rise of 1.25 for British currency and 1.875 for US currency. The Customs Gold Unit fell by 1.5 points, causing sudden apprehension among Chinese merchants, and a sudden relaxation in the situation. However, due to banks taking advantage of the cheap prices to settle accounts, the situation could still be maintained. The HSBC's official exchange rate announcement revealed a rise of 1.25 for British currency and an increase of 1.875 for US currency. Sassoon's efforts to suppress the shilling led to a further loosening of the situation. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, still levied at 6.75% of the British exchange rate calculated at one shilling, five pence, and six five six two five. The Chinese merchants' psychology has become calm, and silver firms are also settling accounts. Both banks and firms are settling accounts, and doing business with each other is also frequent. The process is slightly tight at this time, but because Sassoon continues to sell shillings, and banks also slightly release them, there is again a slight loosening. The process has turned to a flat market. By the noon closing, the current-term selling price was one shilling, four pence, and nine three seven five for British currency, and thirty-four yuan and eight seven five for US currency, a slight loosening of British currency and a slight tightening of US currency by 0.0625 compared to the previous closing price. The overall trend can be described as stable, and the Chinese merchants' psychology has become stable, with a slight appetite for buying. Approximately 300,000 yuan worth of US currency and a small amount of shillings were traded. Sassoon continued to sell a large number of shillings to banks. The transaction prices for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price of the British currency market this morning was one shilling, four pence, and nine three seven five. Korea sold spot goods to British Bank for five pence.

The buying price was increased by 0.0625.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates Seemingly Relaxed</p>
<p>Due to year-end closing, the financial situation has been tense in recent days. The amount of funds being collected and settled has also increased. However, in the foreign interbank lending market, the transaction of discount bills has not increased significantly, so the market price has gradually relaxed. The morning and afternoon markets yesterday both traded at two jiao three fen, a decrease of four fen compared to the previous day. Due to insufficient allocation of funds, the interest rate remained at two fen, no longer as high as the previous days. In terms of discount bills, over 3.2 million were transferred in the morning market, with over 400,000 in new transactions.

<p>Copper Coins Have Returned to Normal</p>
<p>Jiangnan and Guangdong Copper Coins Continue to Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan copper coins rose by four yuan in the morning market, reaching 842 yuan, but returned to 838 yuan in the afternoon market. Therefore, the result was still the same as the previous day. The trading volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong copper coins fell by eight yuan in the morning market to 752 yuan, and slightly rebounded by a few jiao in the afternoon market to 752 yuan and three jiao. As a result, it continued to fall by seven yuan and seven jiao compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 120,000 jiao in the morning market and 80,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 310,000 wen, an increase of 12,000 wen compared to the previous day. The trading volume was 41,540 strings of wen, equivalent to 13,400 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>Securities: Public Bonds Experience Another Downturn</p>
<p>Near and Far-Term Market Prices Have Converged</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, although foreign interbank lending rates eased by four fen, the market price showed no improvement and instead moved downward. The rebound from the closing price the day before yesterday was only a fleeting moment. The market price gradually weakened, and the abnormal situation of near and far-term market prices converging still appeared, and it became increasingly close, even to the point where the far-term exceeded the near-term. This kind of irregular anomaly occurred after the September 18th Incident due to the urgency of funds, but its abnormality was far different from the present. It will only be able to recover when the current foreign exchange returns to the norm. Therefore, although the environmental situation is good, arbitrage trading is still rare, and the market price is struggling to rise. The future is still temporarily in a downward curve. Yesterday's experience: the opening price in the morning seemed to have an upward trend, but the military reorganization bonds only improved by two or three jiao, and people's hearts were therefore discouraged. Starting from the 20th bond, it fell due to the selling of 53rd bonds, so the subsequent listings were lower by two or three jiao. In the second round, people's hearts turned weak, and there was also selling of the 16th bond, and the market price trended downward severely. The gold short bond fell sharply by six jiao and a half. The opening price in the afternoon was slightly chaotic, with highs and lows alternating. Although the 4th bond had purchases from five fen one jiao to two jiao and a half, it still felt weak. According to the late evening news, the situation in the Pacific was gradually rising, which originally had a rebound, but was hit again, and continued to decline by two or three jiao. Although there is a rebound in the future, it may not be easy to restore its original state. The market price result was a drop of one or two jiao to seven or eight jiao. The trading volume was extremely high, totaling 3.845 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>The New Fung Foreign Exchange reported that the New York stock market experienced a sudden downturn in the last half hour yesterday (the 11th), with each stock falling by one to four yuan or more. Trading was brisk, and the telegraphic transfer machines were overwhelmed. Initially, trading was light and prices trended slightly weaker, but the situation suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse. Large transactions of 1,000 to 5,000 shares were sold off one after another, and the downward trend was also fierce. The reason for the sudden crash is still unclear. It may be because traders were disappointed that railway stocks could not maintain their rise. The Roose film initially experienced a downturn due to rumors that the company's general manager would apply to the board of directors for a dividend of seven jiao and five fen. Bulls took the opportunity to close out their positions, resulting in a slight decline of around two yuan. In the bond market, foreign bonds were quite strong due to improvements in the European situation, while domestic bonds showed mixed results. The small exchange was weak at the end due to bulls closing out their positions and increased selling. Chicago grains fell due to reports of large wheat imports. The total daily trading volume was 1.28 million shares.</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn Market: Dim and Lifeless</p>
<p>The yarn market remains calm. The demand for existing yarn has turned light again. The General Kee bull camp has not softened. Although the general retail investors are tired, they are unwilling to act rashly because the bull camp is still strong. As a result, transactions have decreased and many blackboards have been opened.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Continues to Weaken</p>
<p>The opening of the bid yarn market in the morning was due to a slight rise in foreign cotton, and new purchases in the market were less active. Therefore, there were very few transactions and the market price fluctuated very little. Many empty boards were opened. Each month fell by one, two, three, and four jiao. The opening of the afternoon market was still flat. It was reported that the existing yarn business was only over 700 bales. The market atmosphere was dim and lifeless. As a result, each month rose or fell by one or two jiao. The sales volume was Tong Kee 650 bales, Kam Cheong 300 bales, Shen Kee In 100 bales, Tai Fung 650 bales, Yuen Tai 250 bales, and Shen Yu 300 bales. The purchases were Tai Yun 300 bales, Kang Fung 1,550 bales, Cheung Fung 650 bales, Tai Cheong 450 bales, Wing Cheong 250 bales, and Tai Cheong 250 bales.

<h3 id="e237">French Divorce Statistics Over the Past Fifty Years <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>—Du</p>
<p>National News Agency dispatch on the tenth: "It has been fifty years since France implemented the divorce law. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Justice, during these fifty years, French courts have approved a total of 722,866 divorces. According to the French divorce law, it was formally promulgated in July 1884 and implemented in September of that year. Within a few months, 1,657 divorce cases were established. By 1885, it had increased to 4,123 cases, and then gradually increased year by year, reaching 28,505 cases in 1931." France is known as a civilized country, and in the past fifty years, its civilization has made rapid progress. The number of divorce cases has also increased day by day. Therefore, I have reached a conclusion that the level of civilization is directly proportional to the number of divorce cases. The higher the level of civilization in a country, the more divorce cases there are.</p>
<p>Our country has always been a country with multiple wives. The higher the official position, the more wives there are. Therefore, being a "king" or "emperor" had the special right to have three wives, nine concubines, twenty-seven concubines, and eighty-one imperial wives. As for later generations, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty even dismissed as many as 3,000 palace women. Therefore, it was not uncommon for wealthy commoners to have three wives and four concubines. Under this system, there were only "seven outs" provisions, and there was no talk of divorce or no divorce. But what about the average woman? She only had the obligation to respect and abide by the "three obediences and four virtues" and "fidelity until death". Therefore, both parties maintained absolute rights and obligations, and cases of expelling wives were rare, and cases of "being divorced" or "being rejected" were not common. Our country is known as an ancient civilization, but the progress of culture is very slow. Even today, it can only be considered a semi-civilized country, perhaps because there are too few divorce cases.</p>
<p>The period of the fastest cultural advancement in our country is now, and the divorce cases are also like "bamboo shoots after the rain". Because today's marriages are absolutely free for men and women. Freedom to marry means natural freedom to divorce. There is no need to put forward the divorce conditions stipulated in the civil law as a standard. As long as the two parties have some disagreements, or the two parties do not understand each other, they can file for divorce tomorrow. Therefore, in a certain divorce case the other day, on the eve of the hearing, the parties involved "ate at the same table" and "slept in the same bed". The next day in court, the two people "looked at each other and smiled, and were in perfect agreement". Although this type of divorce case is a record-breaking creation, it can be seen that divorce is equal to child's play and is not worth counting. Therefore, the other day there were nine men having sexual relations with a fifteen-year-old girl, but it was just child's play. Try opening the newspaper and taking a look. What day is there no divorce case? Not only are there divorce cases every day, but there are multiple cases in one day. I can see from these divorce cases that our country has truly made civilized progress and that the country is truly promising.</p>
<p>Now, do more divorce suits come from the husband's side? Or do more come from the wife's side? I will not discuss it now. In short, "sons are always your own, wives are always better at other people's homes." This is the common psychology of men. What is the psychology of women? I do not know. I can boldly say that although there are many who are "faithful until death," it cannot be said that there are absolutely none who have the same feelings as men. There used to be an old saying, "Regret three years after your wife dies." It also said, "A farmer who harvests ten more bushels of wheat still wants to change his wife." Because at that time, it was felt that divorce was not easy, so they often dared not do it. They only hoped that their wife would die. The reasons why it was not easy were, first, the constraints of etiquette, and second, the constraints of law. Therefore, they thought about divorce, but never dared to do it. This is probably the reason why the evolution of civilization in our country has stopped.</p>
<p>Therefore, to see the degree of civilized evolution of a country and society, one can look at the number of divorce cases that occur. To take it a step further, to see the degree of personal civilization, one can look at whether the person has divorced or not. Therefore, divorced people are the most civilized and fashionable people. If they hold a "yellow-faced wife" as a treasure, then they are "uncultured" and "unpromising" things. If you observe the degree of civilization in this way, it is probably very accurate, right? Therefore, Western philosophers have said that the more enlightened the people are, the thinner the morals are, which is not bad.</p>

<p>— Bai Yang</p>
<p>It is said that this year's magazines are popular and called "Magazine Year" because society is progressing, people are becoming more and more busy, and there is no time to match long, huge works. You can only steal a little time to read in the midst of busyness. This reason is quite trustworthy. Hasn't society progressed to the point where a 24-story building has already been completed majestically? And people are becoming more and more busy, even college students are becoming pickpockets. So even bookworms who read day and night are probably going to put down their books and look for a job.</p>
<p>However, in this competitive society, apart</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>from a portion of people who rely on a certain force to hold high positions, most people feel that they do not have enough knowledge and want to read a little more. However, the problem of bread is closely following behind, preventing you from going to college to stroll around like a young master. Therefore, humor and essays are hastily chosen as intellectual food. Although booksellers are worthy of admiration for the hard work of young people, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and this morphine needle is not enough to do the job!</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to seek a cheap, beautiful, and effective entry to learning, then "One Hundred Days to Success" is the answer!</p>
<p>I am one of the 99% of these people, and we should really thank the authors for their kindness, and first shout "One Hundred Days to Success" long live!</p>
<p>After discovering the advertisement, I spent several hours of precious time purchasing "One Hundred Days to Success" from Culture Street. Eagerly reading under the lamp, I spent a week working hard, but the result was nothing. This naturally raises a question: Although "One Hundred Days to Success" is effective quickly, it does not necessarily turn into "Seven Days to Success"? But I think that most of the young people in the group have already been fooled. Alas, long live!</p>
<p>Now, after seeing the "Film Performance One Hundred Days to Success" by Standard Beauty Ms. Xu Lai, I suddenly realized.</p>
<p>Originally, in China, as long as you have appeared on the screen, you are a "star", so there have been quite a few star talents since China had movies. Many non-stars who are eager to choose food want to illegally become "bright," and those rape cases are said to have happened this way, which is not sad! Ms. Xu Lai is called the Standard Beauty, but the image she gives us on the screen is just a "bath". Although the beauty is standard, her screen cultivation is not necessarily a standard star, so this "One Hundred Days to Success" can be imagined, and the rest of the "One Hundred Days to Success" may not be like this!</p>
<p>Impatient friends, how can reading be a hundred days or ten days?</p>

<p>Outside the window, the leaves have fallen.</p>
<p>In the distance, the white misty rain obscures the world. Winter rain clouds loom in the sky. The bare branches at the bottom of the fallen leaves in front of the window are struck by the rain, rustling.</p>
<p>It is so lonely, and the mood is so indifferent.</p>
<p>It is winter, the north wind is blowing, thinking of the warm southern country! There are loving mothers, close friends, a warm home, evergreen trees, and beautiful and charming scenery! There, there is no winter, no fallen leaves!</p>
<p>Really tired! So much.</p>
<p>Lazily leaning against the window, looking at the melancholy blue sky, listening to the annoying sound of rain, how deserted the mood feels!</p>
<p>There is no sound of birds, in the cold air, the birds are fleeing! What a cold and lonely atmosphere!</p>
<p>The heart is empty as if there is nothing, and the hands can hardly be lifted. It really feels like a drunk person.</p>
<p>Cherishing the home, cherishing the faint sorrow. The mood is very lonely!</p>
<p>It really feels as lonely as on an island in the Arctic Ocean, as on the deserted island where Robinson lived. But there is still wind howling, and rain dripping.</p>
<p>Looking again at the white misty rain outside the window, and looking at the fallen leaves swirling in the north wind.</p>
<p>"It's the time for the leaves to fall!" That's all I feel, the only feeling I can feel!</p>
<p>What a lonely mood, like being in the desert or on the sea.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Who is Responsible for Runaway Maids? <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>These are two letters concerning the issue of responsibility in employing servants. Because they are of the same nature, they are published together with some opinions from the editor. It is hoped that readers will discuss them.</p>
<p>(1) Five years ago, a young maid was introduced to me by a relative and employed in my home. Later, because the maid's work was not very satisfactory, I asked the introducer to take her back. However, the introducer insisted that she be kept on due to the girl's poor family situation. Considering humanitarian reasons, I had no choice but to continue employing her. One day, the maid claimed to have something to attend to and wanted to return home. My family allowed her to go. Unexpectedly, the girl never returned. I immediately inquired with the introducer and her family, but they said she never arrived home. I then posted notices everywhere, searching for her, but to no avail. At that time, I convened a meeting with the original introducer, and I paid twenty yuan for overseas travel to compensate for everything, considering it a closed matter. Recently, the family and the introducer have brought up the old matter again, demanding the girl back. I am unable to cope with this. I earnestly request guidance to relieve my worries.</p>
<p>Luo Jiaxiong</p>
<p>(2) A friend of mine purchased a maid through a broker this spring, with a ten-year contract. The maid fell ill in July and died on September 30th.</p>
<p>During her illness, I repeatedly sent letters to the broker and the maid's family, urging them to come and visit. The family replied that they lacked travel funds and therefore could not come. Their letter was sent to a Mr. Jia, a fellow villager, who verbally conveyed this message to my friend's home.</p>
<p>Since the maid became ill, she was taken to the hospital for registration and treatment more than ten times, including two visits to Western doctors (without medical records) and one visit to a Chinese medicine doctor, with a prescription. After the maid died, my friend did not report the death or have an examination performed; instead, he immediately purchased a coffin and prepared for burial. He also sent a letter to the girl's family. Unexpectedly, Mr. Jia, who used to be a lawyer but has been disbarred by the Lawyers Association, instigated the girl's family to accuse my friend of abuse leading to death. The prescription was taken away and hidden by the other party's lawyer under the pretense of investigation.</p>
<p>I have the following two questions and request detailed answers:</p>
<p>(1) If the maid died of illness, but the family was not present at the time of burial, can they accuse him of assault based on this fact?</p>
<p>(2) Is Mr. Jia guilty of instigating the family to falsely accuse my friend of assault?</p>
<p>Li Mengchen</p>
<p>Editor's Note: There are no explicit legal provisions regarding the responsibilities of employers and employees. However, according to general customs, there seems to be a principle that can explain this matter. That is, a servant who is of age and has the capacity for action is difficult, if not impossible, to constantly restrain. Therefore, the employer should not be responsible for any outrageous behavior on their part. The possibility of a servant running away is always present and impossible to prevent. If the employer were always held responsible, who would dare to hire servants? As for younger servants (e.g., fourteen or fifteen years old), the employer's obligation is limited to a certain degree of protection and does not extend to full responsibility.</p>
<p>The editor believes that if a servant is instructed by the employer to do something, such as a very dangerous task, and suffers harm as a result, then the employer should be responsible. Other than that, the employer is not responsible for illness, death, escape, or other such events.</p>
<p>In Luo's case, the young maid ran away without a valid reason. Unless the employer was unreasonably abusive, Luo should not be held absolutely responsible. Even though the maid was young, she would eventually leave the employer. Shopping and going out provided opportunities to escape. How could the employer constantly supervise her? Since the person has already run away, Luo's responsibility is only to assist in the search. Paying money was out of sympathy for the loss of their daughter, but it was a mistake. Perhaps the compensation is the very reason they are seizing the opportunity to extort money. If her family continues to make a fuss and demand the person, then for the sake of future peace, the only solution is to use the law. If money is used to compensate again, we think those people will see that you are easy to bully and will continue to bother you.</p>
<p>Regarding Li's situation, he is certainly not responsible for the death of his maid due to illness. Furthermore, he notified the family in advance and took her to the hospital more than ten times, with consultations from Chinese and Western doctors. This can prove that she died of illness and not from abuse or harm. If Mr. Jia instigated the family to accuse him of abuse leading to death, Li can confront him in court. Although the prescription was taken away, the hospital and Chinese and Western doctors can prove his innocence. When absolutely necessary, an autopsy can be performed to determine if there were any injuries. They are intentionally making false accusations and are therefore guilty. Li's reasons and evidence are sufficient, so it doesn't seem to be a problem.</p>
<p>The contract for buying and selling a maid for a fixed term is not legally valid because a person cannot be bought and sold casually. Although Li's case is in the past, the editor feels it is necessary to inform the general readers.</p>

<p>Opening "Crying for Flowers"</p>
<p>Thin and weak, walking slowly. Only for pear blossoms, the heart is foolish. Pear blossoms report spring and wait with heart to grow. Now I fear the cold and have no intention to write new words. Looking far at the mountain pass, clouds are stacked. Pushing open the window to see rain threads. Fine rain moistens the flowers, the flowers seem drunk. Gentle breeze combs the willow, the willows are like silk. Pear blossoms, your ice-jade skin is comparable. Keep yourself clean and always persevere. Your face is only three parts white. Could it be because I chanted the flower selling song? Pear blossoms, every frown and smile must have words. Surely half is shame and half is foolishness. Today, don't be blown away by the east wind. Why does the east wind frequently whip? Pear blossoms, birds cherish their feathers and peck against the wind. Why are your petals blown into the ink pond? It is difficult to meet a wild goose foot to send a letter. Ink pond petal shadows comfort longing. Pear blossoms, who sees and cherishes your haggard face? Only I cherish love here. Sweeping up petals into the qin pouch. Pity my inch of heart, don't嫌 late. Crying for flowers, tears are not yet dry. Do flowers have feelings? Who knows? Helplessly, I close the window and quietly listen to the wind bamboo sweeping orchids.</p>

<p>The mountain trees heavily obscure a thousand miles of sight. The river flow curves like nine intestines.</p>
<p>Together we came to the tattooed land of Baiyue. Still, news is delayed in a single village.</p>

<p>Wang Jun's warships descended to Yizhou. The royal aura of Jinling was dimmed and subdued.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Facial Damage is Deeply Feared by Actresses <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Liu</p>
<p>Rather Lose Life Than Spoil Face - Martha Therefore Died, Carole Dared Not Look in Mirror</p>
<p>No matter how important you say the figure, the limbs, and the hands and feet are in performance, the face is still the most important part for movie stars, especially female stars. They fear that one day their faces will be damaged. Their film life will also be over. They would rather die than have their faces damaged. Therefore, in times of great danger, they will hold their faces with both hands, regardless of their bodies. This is their subconscious action, due to the importance they usually attach to their faces. Years ago, there was a very famous actress, Martha Mansfield. She was on her way home from the photography studio after finishing a film. She was still wearing a costume, made of very thin gauze. After she got into her car, she was exhausted. She struck a match, lit a cigarette, closed her eyes, smoked, and rested very comfortably. Suddenly her clothes caught fire. Martha woke up in shock. She saw the fire and immediately held her face with both hands. The driver immediately stopped the car, ran to the back seat, and shouted, "Quickly put out the fire with your hands!" The fire could have been put out with a single pat, but Martha refused to take her hands away from her face. She was burned all over her body and died, but when she was put in the coffin, her face was still bright and alive. Losing life for the sake of the face is something everyone deeply regrets.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, Carole Lombard's car had an accident and her face was severely injured. She hired several famous surgical experts to sew her face, but they could not guarantee that her face would be restored to its original state. When Carole heard this, the mental pain she suffered could be said to be a hundred times greater than the pain she suffered on her face, because she would rather break like jade than survive like tile. There were many times when she refused to look in the mirror, fearing that she could not bear the pain of a completely broken career. She dared not look at the inevitable reality. After much treatment, the bandages on her face were removed. The doctor told her that her face had miraculously recovered as before, but she still suspected that the doctors were comforting her. She nervously went to get a mirror. When she saw her face, it was indeed undamaged, and she felt that life was meaningful. She now has some fine scars on her face, but some say that the fine scars have increased her beauty, and Carole's reputation has increased tenfold. However, we must understand that Carole Lombard's incident is one in ten million. Apart from that, similar to the above incident was Alice Faye's car accident. She did not damage her face. At that time, she was very grateful that her life was saved, so she did not think about whether her face was damaged or not. But now that she has returned to the photography studio, she thanks God every day for giving her that special favor. She still has a small scar on her left eyelid, which is a souvenir. But that small scar has increased her charm.</p>
<p>Many stars are willing to ride bad horses, drive cars at full speed, play polo, fly planes, hunt, climb mountains, and do all kinds of dangerous games without fear, but when they, or they, have a small pimple on their face, then it's terrible. If an actress breaks her leg, she may only hire one doctor to treat her, but if she breaks a layer of skin on her face, she may hire two doctors, plus a dermatologist. You can't blame them, because their careers depend on their faces. So when Mae West met a robber, the robber pointed a gun at her face and told her to take off her jewelry. Mae calmly said, "Hey, friend, you can take the jewelry, but don't point the gun at my face. You took the jewelry; I can buy it again, but where does the money for another face come from?" Of course, we admire Mae West's courage to dare to talk eloquently in front of the robber, but the robbers knew her psychology, so their second threat was: "If you dare to testify in court and identify me as the person who robbed you, be careful! I will pour nitric acid on your face." Mae West was not afraid, and she still went to court to testify. It wasn't that she didn't value her face, she just refused to be threatened by robbers.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Review of "Of Human Bondage" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Fu</p>
<p>Of Human Bondage</p>
<p>— Great Shanghai Screening</p>
<p>The women in this world can only be bought with three things: money, pleasure, and youth. Those who bind themselves with love threads, clinging and sentimental, thinking that they are born to love, are really just big fools who are pitiful and annoying to look at.</p>
<p>The story is about such a big fool: unilaterally loves a fluid woman, everyone thinks "it's not a good marriage," but he himself almost desperately loves her. The first time she married someone else, she was abandoned, and she returned to his arms. The second time she hooked up with his good friend, quarreled with him on purpose, destroyed his beloved famous paintings and books, and made him dizzy with anger. The third time she left him, she only had the road of depravity left.</p>
<p>This fool always has loose strands of connection, never forgetting her. Although there are people who can be gentle and considerate to him, giving him spiritual comfort, they can't resist the enchanting and romantic bad woman. The result of this change is, of course, that the woman ends up in poverty, and the fool finally has the harvest of "heaven does not disappoint those who have a good heart." Finally, he married a virtuous wife.</p>
<p>The script of this play is indeed good, so it is easy for the director to excel, and the impression it gives us is quite profound. What is most enlightening to us is why Leslie Howard has a special fondness for it and must love such a woman who has nothing but "flesh" and is annoying. It can be seen in every place, every era has this kind of "perverted love," which is also the phenomenon of so-called "sea of ​​suffering" and "hell." However, we are "clear observers," so we have this intuition. What we feel here has nothing to do with "love," only "karma." The title "Of Human Bondage" is very correct.</p>
<p>In the photography that tells this story, we see the director's skill. The distribution of roles is not sloppy. In the performance of three different women, the audience is quite satisfied. In addition to Leslie Howard, the two different women manipulators are also well-suited. Whether a play is good or not, we not only look at the protagonist, but I think the emphasis on supporting roles is also more important.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Review of "Wake Up and Dream" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Wake up and Dream</p>
<p>In the United States, which is known as the land of gold, even amidst the economic panic and widespread unemployment, the film and song industry appears to be experiencing a distorted prosperity on the surface. However, in reality, female stars and renowned singers also inevitably suffer from the dread of unemployment.</p>
<p>"Wake Up and Dream" vividly portrays the plight of these artists who possess exceptional skills but cannot earn enough to live on.</p>
<p>Kelly is the host of a song and dance troupe, with singers Scotti and female star Toby as the mainstays. However, their business is slow and not enough to make a living. While seeking a way out, they receive a telegram and discover that someone wants to hire another famous singer, Seabro. Kelly falsely claims that Seabro is unwilling to be hired and recommends Scotti and Toby as replacements. Due to Scotti and Toby's artistic talents in the audition, they are finally hired with great difficulty. Unexpectedly, the famous singer suddenly accepts the invitation and arrives. Kelly, posing as a receptionist, gets him drunk and hides him in a secluded room. As a result, the incident is exposed, and they are charged. The three of them have to flee to New York while being pursued by the police.</p>
<p>In the bustling and lively New York, they go to theaters and photography studios of all sizes, but no one is willing to hire them even at the lowest price. They have to work as living advertisements and perform as extras walking on electric wires in extremely tall buildings, risking their lives to earn a small amount of bread.</p>
<p>These descriptions of the suffering of artists in such a society are quite profound. It also touches upon the crime of fraud committed out of necessity for survival, and the misunderstanding of the stage owner who pursues them out of love for their talent, but is mistaken for a police pursuit and is avoided.</p>
<p>Next, Scotti meets his old friend Chilini, a stage tycoon, in a public apartment and returns to Hollywood. Scotti, from being a small cafe employee, is hired by a film company and is able to display his unique skills, becoming famous overnight. Naturally, the story of love is not spared by the producers, and here, the description of the pursuit of life turns into a triangular love affair, culminating in the realization of the dream of fame, fortune, and beauty at the celebratory banquet for their success. In other words, the more meaningful real-life story is sacrificed in a vulgar and decorative conclusion.</p>
<p>Another flaw in the story is the large number of characters involved. Director Kart Neumaph fails to grasp the personalities of the characters, and the overall handling of the film is not very clever. In the first third of the film, the narration of Kelly and others' unemployment, the detention of Seabro, the escape after the incident, and the hardships in New York are concise and clear. The middle part is simply chaotic and ambiguous, leaving the main actors with nothing to do, until later when they are allowed to have a more adequate performance of their love affair.</p>
<p>The main actors, such as Ross Copobu, Laochie Plasi, and Joanne Edward, put in a lot of effort in their performances, but besides the three singing auditions, they did not achieve the success they deserved.</p>
<p>The darker lighting can certainly symbolize a part of their dim lives, but the entire film being like this actually reduces its power.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since Cheng Bugao directed "Go to the Northwest" and we haven't seen his new work! All we have seen is that segment he directed in "Daughter's Classic", but it still left a deep impression on countless audiences.</p>
<p>"Night Blooming Cereus" is a script he wrote himself. To make it even better, he spent several sleepless nights carefully writing this work, and it has been successfully filmed in recent days.</p>
<p>The main actors include Hu Die, Zhao Dan, Sun Min, and Shu Xiuwen, who are all praised by the audience as the most talented actors. Of course, under the leadership of director Cheng Bugao, the results will be even more wonderful.</p>
<p>"Season of Falling Flowers" is Wu Cun's new work as a writer and director after "Bigamy". "Bigamy" was an unexpected success, so "Season of Falling Flowers" will go a step further, be more complete, and more watchable.</p>
<p>The main actors include Xu Lai, Gong Jianong, and Zhao Dan, all of whom are veterans of the silver screen. We wish them to bring a different kind of light to the dark film industry. (Que)</p>

<p>If foreigners invest in building large film studios in China, I guarantee that China's already fragmented film industry will be even more shattered beyond recognition.

<p>Forget it! If film practitioners don't improve themselves, it is impossible for the general public to value you! You should improve your own private lives, and stop being so shameless in doing those shameless things!</p>

<h3 id="e249">Interesting Stories of Auctions (I Sell Anything) (III) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Ming</p>
<p>At this time, Groen's palatial residence had become a low-grade antique shop, piled everywhere with furniture, and not even good stuff. Strangely enough, these gentlemen should have suspected Groen's taste, but unfortunately, they always felt that Groen could not be wrong, so they did not investigate. After a while, the auction was about to begin, and everyone was laughing and cheering, as if the Groen family had reached the end of their rope today, and everyone was celebrating. Spod first auctioned off a wooden cabinet. He spoke glibly about the various benefits of the wooden cabinet. As a result, the wooden cabinet sold for three hundred and seventy-five dollars. Spod tried hard to hold back his laughter. He had seen fools on Second Street, and he had seen fools on Old Broadway, but the fools on Fifth Avenue were the most delicious, because the original price of that wooden cabinet was only thirty-five dollars, and the original seller was still waiting for the money. Isn't this interest too good to earn? When Barbara heard the tens, hundreds, and thousands of dollars pouring in like flowing water, she was initially elated, but later she couldn't help but feel scared—what would those wealthy people do after moving the dilapidated furniture into their homes? If an expert pays a little attention to it, then goodbye Spod! As she thought, she counted the checks, all signed by gentlemen, and her hand seemed to be holding a sample book of signatures from a large bank. She looked outward and saw Milison standing next to Spod, listening quietly as Spod eloquently read out each item being auctioned. She couldn't help but shake her head. She knew Milison was no good, just as she knew Milison's golden hair was dyed. She knew Spod was bound to be fooled by Milison. But she felt powerless to help. She couldn't tell him either. Even if she told him, he wouldn't believe it.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, today's auction was an unexpectedly great success. Just look at those gentlemen and ladies, listening quietly to Spod's big talk, and enjoying it, grabbing to buy without any doubt. After a while, Spod got some free time, jumped to Barbara's side, and instructed her, "Call Monk immediately to the bank and exchange some cash. Tell him to come back right away. Those who supplied the furniture and antiques are still waiting for the money." That's right, those people were still waiting in the next room. They were all Spod's accomplices, all making a living from auctions, but they didn't quite believe it and insisted on waiting for the cash before leaving. Barbara took a roll of checks and handed it to Monk. Monk had already drunk a lot of wine at that time. He took the checks and immediately ran to the bank to exchange them for cash. He took the cash back, but he first needed to find a place to put the cash before handing it over to Spod. He ran upstairs, saw a small wooden box in a small room. He put the large roll of banknotes in the wooden box and locked it. He also locked the small room. Then he found a bed and fell asleep. At this time, Spod had gone mad with the auction, selling everything he saw. He ran to the room where Monk was sleeping, chased away the drowsy Monk, and picked up the furniture to auction it off. He sold the bed, the table, and the chairs. He suddenly saw the small room and wanted to open it, but the door was locked. He couldn't help but be surprised and delighted, "Haha, the door is locked, there must be good stuff inside. I can sell it too." As he spoke, he forcibly broke down the door. He saw a small wooden box inside. He dragged it out. He didn't know that it contained most of the day's income, so he picked it up and auctioned it off. But that box didn't look like a valuable item. No matter how hard you blow your trumpet, the buyers were not enthusiastic. Spod originally wanted to sell it—including the contents—for one hundred dollars. He knew it must be empty, locked by mistake in the furniture store. (To be continued)</p>
