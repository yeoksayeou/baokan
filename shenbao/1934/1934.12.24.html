<p>對英恊調已提切實建議</p>
<p>悄然進行充實海軍實力</p>
<p>（華盛頓）日本廢止華盛頓海軍條約後所引起種種國際問題、美國政府對之將力求審愼、現擬遵循之途徑、不外下列數點、</p>
<p>（一）一切言行、凡可以視爲反對日本者、須力求避免、</p>
<p>（二）條約失效之前、須與英國竭誠合作、以便對於日本之實力平等要求共同抗拒、關於此點之辦法、美國聞已對英提出切實之建議、</p>
<p>（三）美國將悄然進行其海軍建造計畫、以達條約限度、並將詳細調查條約失效後、有何海軍上意外之事可以發生、然進行此事、亦將力避招搖、</p>
<p>（四）政府於國會開議期内、仍將與日本進行外匀討論、以期另得諒解、並使日本允自動依照五·五·三比率限制軍備、觀此計畫、可知政府之海軍外交政策眼前目的在於防止日本破壞英美恊調、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據此間今日表示、政府對於日本之廢止華盛頓海軍條約、並不存憤恨之念、不僅如是、羅斯福總統及其親信顧問且惜倫敦談話之未能成立新約焉、政府切實反對國會内外種種言論卽太平洋沿岸關設海軍航空新根據地、積極增進海軍建造計畫、以及其他備戰宣傳等等、蓋政府之正式態度完全和平、卽使有海軍競爭之舉、亦必待他人爲首倡也、至日本之廢約通知、據可靠消息、將由齊藤大使於星期三四遞交國務院、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）預料日本將於下星期通告廢止華盛頓海軍條約、國會方面充實國防及軍備之議仍如雨後春筍、衆議員麥克斯溫提出最新計畫、建議於接近加拿大之邊境及大西洋太平洋墨西哥灣沿岸、各築不能炸毁之地底飛機塲、麥氏並鄭重聲明、建築此種機塲、並非爲敵對於加拿大及墨西哥之表示、惟爲預防敵人不得彼國之許可卽假道以空軍襲擊耳、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）陸軍部長鄧恩今日以陸軍年報提呈總統、年報中力主美國陸軍卽刻增加實力、以完成長官一萬四千及士兵十六萬五千之數、並建議卽刻實施添購飛機計劃、以使陸軍於三年之内、至少可有飛機二千三百二十架、鄧恩氏亦主陸軍之摩托化及機器化務使於最短時期内完成、軍官之升擢制度亦宜改良、現在軍官遞升、並通皆按步就班、循級而進、此種方法早爲海軍部所廢棄、各國亦鮮有行者、據陸長之建議、將來之升擢、宜以功績優良及考試及格爲標準、陸長之議、一般軍人皆所歡迎、惟有久列行伍之軍官則將反對、因此輩不能與年壯幹練者競爭、勢必不得已而退伍也、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）陸軍參謀總長麥克亞梭今日向陸軍部長鄧恩提呈年報、所述美國陸軍情形頗爲黯淡、麥氏謂一九二○年之國防案未能充分實施、蓋「吾人之軍隊老朽不堪、實未足保障吾人理想中之安全也、」陸軍應有之實力爲二十八萬人、然現在不過十一萬入千七百五十人、各州陸軍應有四十三萬人、而現在所有者祇十七萬五千人、至於後備隊實力雖無核準之定數、然事實上並無一人、此種弱點、列强知之甚悉、而糾正此弊、全賴美國人民、美國须須有常備軍十六萬五千人、國防軍二十一萬人、且至少應有精練之後備軍十二萬人云、麥氏報告中亦建議陸軍改良運輸、因陸軍須要拿破崙式之行動速率也云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>恒·</p>
<p>日本廢止華府海約之通告。已於二十二日由日本政府正式發出。耶誕節後。卽可由駐美大使齊藤送達美政府。日本此舉。傳說已久。凡留心國際事件者。莫不知此爲必然之結果。不足爲異。由此而後。海縮會議。必將繼軍縮會議而成爲一大僵局。蓋日本旣要求海軍之平等。英美又不願與之平等。則任何談話。皆將毫無結果。故日本於廢約之頃。雖亦表示續開談判。然其成效之渺茫則又可不卜而知也。</p>
<p>日本此一步驟。雖簽約各國。皆蒙影響。然打撀最大者。厥爲美國。蓋美爲華府海約之主盟國。且此約之目的。含有限止日本膨脹之意思。故日本今次之行動。不啻對美國之遠東政策。作决絕的表示也。美國海軍部長史璜生曾謂。美國之海軍政策。質言之。卽在支持國家之政策。保衛海上之貿易。防守本部及其海外之屬地。史氏所謂美國國家之政策。其在遠東當爲九國公約所包含之一切。亦卽所謂對華門戶開放等等政策也。所謂屬地。當指菲島關島等等而言。然事實上九國公約已被撕破矣。門戶開放。亦不能確保矣。而美國所能爲者。亦僅止於抗議。而美之識者。又皆明白承認。菲島一旦受人襲擊美必無法保持之故美之對日。不能有所作爲。初不待海約之廢而始顯。易詞以言。日本今次之廢約。雖予美美國惟難堪。然在短期間内。美國亦必無法應付之也。　　蓋今日美國所顧慮者。其原因尙不止一端。其一爲英美之難以完全合作。英之與美。雖爲兄弟之邦。最近海縮會談。亦曾共拒日本海軍平等之要求。然其關係。僅止於不助日以戰美。欲其助美以戰日。似亦尙少可能性。二則。日本海軍實力。已達條約所許限度。而美之海軍。則瞠乎其後。卽照文　氏之擴充法案努力進行。欲達條約限度。亦須在一九三九年之底。故單獨行動。卽無以駕御日本。三則。美國在遠東之海軍根據地。如菲島關島。皆以四國公約之關係。中止軍港要塞之擴充。防禦力量。極爲薄弱。一遇强敵卽有失守之虞。故已失去遠東海軍根據地之價値。日本廢約之後。美國雖可於此大事擴充軍港。增築要塞。然亦决非急切所可成。四則。日本若取守勢。以逸待勞。輔之以陸地之要塞。空軍之根據。復益以亞洲大陸一切資源之供給。不難擊破任何强大之艦隊。且日本海中國海之間。島嶼縱橫。不可勝數。稍事布置。卽可成爲空軍潛艇活動之根據地。有此數端。故以美國單獨之力。卽使趕緊努力預備。仍恐難與日本周旋也。</p>
<p>故以目下之情勢觀察。苟非英美之關係。别有新發展。則對於日本之宣告廢約。恐終無術以應付之耳。</p>

<p>擴充原料利源</p>
<p>（柏林）今日公布法令一道對國内實業許給津貼、俾用以鞏固與擴張原料利源、此項計畫志在增進國家之經濟獨立、惟未規定何種實業可享國家此種輔助、衆意從事試騐以求獲有外國原料相當代替品之各實業必居前列也（二十二路透電）</p>
<p>（國民新聞社柏林通訊）德國因對外貿易之不振、以及國際支付之不能保持均衡、而不得不施行外貨入口之限制、因是德國經濟情勢及其在世界經濟上之地位、頗爲世人注目、以德國國内經濟之發展狀况、與對外貿易相對照、其對外貿易、今日實處於極不順利之地位、最近各國頗傳德國限制外貨入口、係爲對於匯付會議之一種做作、期於債務上獲得較好之結果、茲就所知用述其眞因如次、</p>
<p>德國因其國内經濟之發展、原能在世界市塲上購買多量之外國原料品、藉以維持及纰繼續改良其國内經濟情勢、且此種外國原料品之輸入、與德國本身亦有重大之關係、蓋德國不在世界市塲上吸收其必需之原料品、則其國内經濟之發展亦將有不能維持之虞也、吾人本此理由、觀察德國之對外貿易、。則知德國限制外貨入口、僅爲匯付會議而設之言、實屬錯誤、</p>
<p>就實際言之、德國處在目前對外貿易入超及國際支付不能保持均衡之嚴重情勢下、實已無此財力在世界市塲上儘量購買其國内經濟上必需及主要之原料、如銅·毛·及棉花等等、德國國家銀行現存之現金及外國貨幣總額爲兩萬萬金馬克、其對外貿易之統計則今年春季入超卽達五千四百萬金馬克、此項入超數目、旣不能以德國遠洋航業及國際航空之收入相抵、而又無其他海外事業足爲外國貨幣流入本國之來源、此實德國限制外貨入口之眞因、使德國在國際支付上之情勢不若今日之惡劣、或各債權國對於德國能表示相當之讓步、或世界各地能大量購買德國貨品、使其對外貿易略見轉而能好、負擔必要之支付、則德國自能以大購主之資格出現於世界市塲、換言之、德國國内經濟之繁榮、實爲促進世界市塲發展之可能、故凡洋意德國國内經濟發展者、應設法挽救德國國際支付太不平衡之惡劣情勢、或謀减少其對外貿易之入超也、</p>
<p>於此有値得吾人之注意者、卽德國紡織工業之發展、其發展之主因、純由購買力之增加、而非受政府之補助、德國紡織工業於去年春季輸入外國原料品二十三萬二千噸、本年春季之輸入、則爲二十六萬五千六百噸、明乎此、可知德國在限制外貨入口以前、爲繁榮世界經濟計、曾不斷的擴張其外國原料之購買力、惟此種情况、因德國在世界市塲雖購入甚巨、而德國貨品之輸出、則日漸减少、遂致不能繼續維持、而最後之結果、乃使德國在世界市塲上旣失其購主之能力、復不能履行其對外應盡之義務、去年德國關於經濟的政治的外債上應借之金額計爲一十四萬萬金馬克、其中三萬萬出於航業鐵路等之盈於七萬萬係從前對外貿易之盈餘、其他四萬萬則出於運金出口、本年對外應付之債額約爲十一萬萬、因對外貿易入超過鉅、絕無盈餘、而現金及外國貨幣所存又復無幾、遂致此項巨額支出、迄無着落、卽使蘇聯依其契约上所訂之金額充分運入德國、德國所有之現金、亦遠不足償付其外債之主要部份、要之、復興世界經濟、應先注意兩種原則、（一）增高購買力、培養各國内部之經濟、（二）各國相互間應在可能範圍以内求經濟的合作與諒解、德國對於第一項原則已盡力實行、至第二項、則猶有特於各國之恊同努力也、</p>

<p>（巴黎通信）</p>
<p>主因爲受改正憲法之影響</p>
<p>對經濟問題又無積極辦法</p>
<p>在政治動搖當中、受全國民衆推戴、各黨派贊同的杜美内閣、都以爲他可超越政爭、繼續安定下去、殊不知到七月間就發生不安之象、杜美氏以隱居之身、受現總統路蒲蘭的邀請、出任艱鉅、他赤手空拳、旣没有政當組織作背景、也没有政治上的野心、不過當他在職的時候、常時是獨行其是、勇往邁進、甚至不和閣員商量而直接訴諸國民、例如改正憲法問題、直到杜美氏以無綫電佈音公表出來後、各閣員纔完全明白、於是惹起同僚間的不滿、社會急進黨赫里歐以下六總長提出辭呈、議會中多數議席遂見動搖、杜氏也就不願再幹下去、可是杜氏的信譽還是很好、許多社會團體、當他下台之後、依然表示好感、</p>
<p>原來法國各政黨所占議席、自一九三二年大選後、可分作三派、極右派與穩健派算一系、急進社會黨與共和社會黨算一系、社會黨與共產黨各派聯合一氣、算反政府系、各黨派中急進社會黨是第一個大黨、他於六百十名議員中有一百五十多個議員、所以全國一致的内閣得不到該黨支持、就不能不倒台、照杜氏的聲望、還可擺脫急進社會黨的牽制、在議院裏去爭多數議席、或直接訴諸國民前、都有得到勝利的可能、但這却有違法之嫌、所以他寗肯掛冠而去、回復其隱居生活、</p>
<p>這次政變的直接原因是　正憲法、卽總統有權解散議院、其所附的條件如下、</p>
<p>（一）大選後一年之内、總統如解散議會、須經參院之同意、</p>
<p>（二）大選舉經一年之後、卽不得參院之贊同、總統亦得下令解散議會、</p>
<p>再就是關於預算方面、「衆議院議員在收入未决定時、不得於要求預算中、有增加支出項目、如至一月一日預算尙未成立者、可準照前年度預算案開支」因此杜氏就和議院發生裂痕、杜氏想在這時候企圖政治上的安定、就非要政府此較的延長生命不可、但是法國的内閣大都是短命内閣、任何政策（除對外大政方針以外、一切都難於實行）自一九七年以來到現在十七年中、竟交替了三十次内閣、法國政治總是在動盪不安之中、杜氏想挽回這種頽風、主張總統有權解散議會、以扶政治走上正軌、確是有見解的、</p>
<p>然而法蘭西現行憲法上、豈不是曾經規定總統經參院同意之後、卽可解散議會嗎、這是一條不實行的空文、是一八七五年保皇黨占多數勢力、又値普法戰爭後混亂時期中的規定、在一八七七年保皇黨的馬克馬洪曾經試行過解散權、結果失敗了、自那時以後、法國政治界卽養成一種傳統觀念、以爲解散議會卽是冒犯普通選舉、所以後來就没有人實行過解散權、</p>
<p>到現在、眞是有點積重難返、成爲政治上的　瘤了、而另一方面的理由、也言之成理、說是誰能保證將來没有人濫用解散權、把民主國轉變成専制、現在雖可以相信杜美氏不致爲非、後來却難於保險、於是改訂憲法案就不能够通過了、</p>
<p>杜美内閣在政治上誠然很得人望、可是他對於經濟並未提出積極辦法、又正當金本位制度遇着困難、失業人數增加到三十四萬餘人的時候、所以也有不少人心懷反感、法蘭丹新内閣依舊在政黨休戰、全國一致旗幟之下組成、並且打破從前的成例、總統未常召集各黨首領先行交換意見、卽直接下令給法蘭丹氏、他從接受命令到組成内閣的時間、祗有十小時、倒是法國所少見的敏捷、至於大政方針、與前閣恐不會有什麽大差别、（十一月十五日於巴黎）</p>

<p>溥唐石霞潛到平交易</p>

<p>珠大如鷄卵能避風塵</p>
<p>北平通信、東交民巷六國飯店、本月十六日、突來一時髦少婦、舉止極爲華貴、自稱爲石靜芝、由滬來平、同行尙有一男子、年四十許、住於崇文門内德國飯店、據稱爲張姓、連日與美古玩商華克托耳往返甚密、此時髦少婦在平四日、並未離飯店一步、僅十九日下午三時離平時、始出飯店之門、以故其形跡極爲詭密、事後經東交民巷某外國銀行華籍職員透出消息、始知此華貴之少婦、卽北平交際塲上聞名一時之溥二奶奶溥唐石霞也、</p>
<p>溥唐石霞爲傀儡溥儀之弟媳、卽溥傑之妻、前三年因厭棄其夫溥傑、將地安門外什刹海後海攝政王府内價値三百餘萬元之古玩珍珠財寳私行携出、潛往上海、聲言與溥傑離異、解除夫妻關係、事後雖經其翁前清攝政王載澧、控搏唐石霞於北平市公安局、並開列所失府内珍寳各物名單、請求軍警當局嚴緝其兒媳追究被盜之財產、但爲時已晚、溥唐石霞已携同財物、遠避滬濱、無法尋緝、此事遂成懸案、歷年旣久、已無復有人注意、僅知此溥二奶奶、已改姓名、在滬上度其逍遙之生活耳、</p>
<p>此次溥唐石霞突然秘密來平、係變賣清室藏寳避塵珠一粒與滬上美古玩商華克托耳、蓋溥唐石霞於民國十九年間、携走攝政王府中財物離平時、因缺乏現欵、卽將此避塵珠押於東交民巷某外國銀行、抵洋兩萬元用作旅費、茲者渠在滬與美商議妥、出售此珠、價洋九萬五千元、溥唐石霞特來平向某銀行贖還此珠、轉售於該外商、現雙方交易、業已竣事、溥唐石霞乃携欵重返滬濱、至於與其同行之張姓男子、則究不知係其何人、而此美商華克托耳、刻尙在北平、寄居於北京飯店、大約不久亦將携此名貴之珍珠他往矣、</p>
<p>據聞此避塵珠、係清慈禧太后最嗜愛之物、蓋慈禧嗜愛珍珠、宮中有兩個最珍貴之名珠、一爲琥珀球、一爲避塵珠、皆大如鷄卵、晶瑩皎潔、世所罕有、據稱此避塵珠能避風塵、慈禧后生時、每於天風時佩帶之、迨後慈禧逝世、此珠遂爲溥儀之妻榮氏所佩帶、至民國十三年、馮玉祥入宮、溥儀夫婦出走、榮氏暗將兩珠携出、卽寄存於攝政王府其父載澧處、於是遂爲溥唐石霞取去、押於外國銀行中、茲復轉售於美商、而此國寳乃爲外人所有、殊可惜也、至於琥珀球、係由載澧携往天津邸中保存、本年夏季、已爲溥儀取往長春、蓋因溥儀在長春多病、據稱佩帶此琥珀球、能除邪祟、故載澧特送往長春、交溥儀佩帶、以除病魔、至此兩寳珠、究竟是否有此上述功效、雖不得知、然兩珠均大如鷄卵、光澤侵人、固屬罕世之珍寳也、（二十一日）</p>

<p>市長致词　吳市長致開會词云、各位今天上海八十一公團公祭史量者先生、史量才先生由杭州回上海、經過滬杭公路、在途次被兇手刺殺、這個消息、傳到上海以後、全上海無論對於史量才先生知道與不知道的人、都是非常悲痛、史先生的突遭狙擊、使社會受了一個極大的損失、國家同社會、非有領袖不可、國家同社會的領袖、不是一朝一夕可以造成功的、是有很長久幾十年的歷史、才可以造成一個領袖、這個領袖、才能够領導國家、領導社會、來做有利國家、有利社會的事業、史量才先生、是社會的一個領袖、他自小的時候、卽見到清政的腐敗、非維新不可、知道維新、非求新智識新學問不可、所以那個時候、他就研究新學問·新智識·從事於維新的事業、史量才先生的事業、我們簡單的可分爲四段來說明、第一、就是他從事於維新運動的敎育事業、第二、是從事於文化事業、來開啟民智、中國現在輿論機關、最有力的、最大的、爲羣衆所信服的、就是申報、申報經史先生經營了二十年、他的力量、一天一天增加、史先生他對於社會、對於公衆的功勞、一天一天的大、所以史先生盡力於中國的輿論、來開發民智、把申報近十年來的成績看來、他的影響於國家、影響於社會、是很大的、第三、史先生的事業、在别的地方、就不必說、我們在上海、就說上海吧、史先生對於上海社會的各種事業、凡是有利於國家社會的、他無不參加、提倡、不但是來參加提倡、他還用他的資財、來參加提倡、上海社會上、許多事業、因爲他的資財來參加提倡、輔助發達不少、第四、史先生在上海一二八戰事中、領導上海地方各團體、組織了一個上海地方市民維持會、贊助政府、應付一二八的戰事、這雖然是一個地方團體、但性質很重要、他的號召力、一但及於全國、且及到海外華僑、使各方愛國同胞、紛紛捐助物品、贊助戰事、這種團體、是中國有史以來、最有力最有效的一個公共團體、一個能在危急存亡槍林彈雨中、盡力救國的</p>

<p>團體、這是永可紀念的事、尤其是史先生及上海各界領袖主持的力量、我們是永遠不會忘記的、今天八十一公團聯合追悼史先生、一方面是紀念、是追悼、一方面是要喚起社會同志、繼史先生的遺志、盡力於社社事業、尤其是史先生所艱苦締造的各種事業、不要因爲先生之死、而隨之衰落、這是今天追悼史先生的意義、同時本人代表主席團建議、（一）發起史先生紀念會、與史先生家屬合辦、以資永遠紀念、（二）主席團並擬與史先生家屬、對與史先生同難之鄧祖詢·黃錦才·二君、表示追悼、當經通過、（炳勛速記社速記）</p>
<p>報告行述　史先生前老友沈信卿君報告史先生行述略云、關於史先生一生經過事業行爲道德、在各報早經詳告、毌待贅述、惟先生生前、足爲吾人效法者、卽精神與思想、史先生有進取精神與沉毅思想、才艰造就今日之事業、所辦事情、不是隨便進行、如能做則做、不能做則止、中華民族多像史先生精神與思想、吾國早已太平、史先生於民元時、翊贊革命工作、從事社會事業、不遣餘力、在一二八時、組織地方恊會、以扶助政府後方力量之不足、其效力於中華民國、且有極大功績云云、</p>
<p>兪佐廷詞　沈信卿君報告畢、繼由市商會主席兪佐廷君致詞云、佐迁記得禮記祭法上、有這麽幾句話、呌做「有大功德於民則祀之、以死勤事則祀之、以勞定國則祀之、能禦大災則祀之、能捍大患則祀之、」古人祭祀的制度、原是一種追念的意思、崇報的意思、與現在舉行的追悼會意思是一樣的、不過形式不同一點罷了、所以我們就把古人祭法的意義、引用到追悼會上面、我們覺得史量才先生在日、眞能做到以死勤事、爲地方捍大患兩句話、近來各地流行的追悼會、有的都是親戚故友發起的、不過私人間的情感罷了、史量才先生、當得起以死勤事、爲地方捍患兩句話、所以我們今天的追悼會、不是爲什麽親戚朋友的情誼而發起的、却是以市民的資格來發起的、想來今天在座的人、都是這樣感想的、史量才先生生平的事業、可以說鞠躬盡瘁、在申報上面、報紙爲社會敎育最好的工具、申報風行、在全國的力量、人人都知道的、所以史量才先生、在中國文化史上、推動的效力、其價値是不能用數字來估計的、他一生的盡瘁、非但應了古人所說以死勤事的一句話、且够得上有大功德於民六個字、至於講到爲地方捍患的話、那末、「一二八」的時候、量才先生們發起的地方恊會、當時是如何努力、想來在座的人、都知道的、不用細說了、我們覺得近年以來、上海有兩個人、橫遭非命、實在是社會上莫大損失、一個是項松茂先生、一個就是史量才先生、項先生是實業界的先進、軀殻雖已毁掉、但他創辦的化學工業、着實做出些成績、往後我們各工廠化學原料、有些可以自行供給、這一點、於國防上極有益的、所以他雖死了、但他已留下很偉大的基業、去獻給國家、這一點、量才先生有同樣的成績、他的軀殻雖然已離塵世、但他所建樹出來的文化事業、輿論中心、已播了極大的種子、建了極深的基礎、是永遠不會毁掉的、記得古人有一句話、呌做生者能自强則死者爲不死、所以我們不但是追悼死者、我們要盡生者的責任、拿出刻苦的精神、做成偉大的事業、這就是佐廷今天一些的感想、請在座諸公指正、</p>
<p>王曉籟詞　王曉籟致詞云、今天追悼史先生是因爲史先生是被人殺死了、我們就來討論一下這死的問題罷、大凡一個人除掉在母親腹中是求生以外、呱呱墜地以後、處處都是求死、平常有一句話、死有重於泰山、有輕於鴻毛、從這兩句話裏、可以發生三種意義、一種是自病死、一種是被人殺死、還有一種就是自殺人是逃不了這三種死、第一種是生老病死的死、是人生所避免不了的、第三種、是自己不樂生而求死、那最無價値、因爲自殺者、都是未盡其做人的責任的、這種死最不道德、只有第二種的死是値得討論的、一個人爲什麽要被人殺呢、被殺自然有被殺的原因、也就是有被殺的價値、人那一個不要死、但所死的是軀殻、而精神是永不會死的、精神的表現在於事業、偉大的事業、卽表現偉大的精神、史先生能够致力於文化服務於社會、能够感動千萬人的愛戴、所以才有今天的追悼會、不則平常人死的很多、何以没有這樣的追悼會舉行呢、我們認清了這一點、那末、要在事業上有成就、則生固可樂、死亦何恨、史先生軀殻雖被人殺了、史先生的精神、是永存的、（炳勛速記社速記）</p>

<p>然後再設法推銷隨時取贖</p>
<p>定元旦發行不使流入市場</p>
<p>新聲社云、湘鄂兩省政府發行之建設公債條例、業經立法院通過、均定元旦日發行、並决先向滬各銀行界抵押借欵、同時設法推銷、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>湖南公債　湖南省建設公債總額一千萬元、利息週年六厘定明年一月一日發行、規定每年付息二次、爲六月三十日及十二月三十一日、用抽籤方法分十年償還、定每年六月十五日及十二月十五日、以該省契稅及營業稅收入爲第一擔保、以該公債所修之公路營業收入爲第二擔保、所收入之本息基金、組基金保管委員會保管之、債票分千元百元十元三種、用途爲修築公路及清債銀行舊欠、</p>
<p>接洽抵押　新聲社記者昨向滬銀行界探悉、湘省建設公債湖南省政府鑒於數目較大、一時推銷之困難、如向人民攤銷、覺得甚爲不妥、决先向滬銀行界接洽抵押、曾由建設廳長余籍傳來滬、於拜訪銀行界領袖張公權等時、請予帮助、務使抵押借欵實現、在原則上各銀行已來同意、旋余廳長卽返省報告、</p>
<p>先押一部　今該省政府擬先向滬中央等銀地將公債票面約四百萬元、抵押現欵二百萬元、業已由該省政府先與該省中央等分行接洽、然後再派員來滬、向各總行接洽、俟成功後、卽擇關係重要之公路先行修築、同時分别向人民推銷、亦决不使流入市塲、</p>
<p>湖北公債　湖北省建設公債、總額爲六百萬元、利息週年六厘、用途爲修築鄂西鄂南公路之用、定明年一月一日發行、每年付息二次、爲六月及十二月、每六個月抽籤還本一次、第一年至第二年、每年償還總額百分之六、第三年至第四年、每年償還總額百分之七、第五年至第六年、每年償還百分之八、第七年至第八年、每年償還百分之九、第九年至十二年、每年償還百分之十、分十二年償還、以該省營業稅收入爲基金、不足時由中央輔助之、債票分千元·百元·十元·五元·四種、</p>
<p>先行抵押　新聲社記者昨向滬銀行界探悉、鄂省建設公債湖北省政府鑒於修築鄂西鄂南公路、事關交通甚鉅、爲刻不容緩之時、决先向滬銀行界、將公債抵押一部份、曾由財政廳長賈士毅上次來滬、拜訪各銀行領袖時談及之、今鄂主席張岳軍氏尙留滬、與銀行界領袖接洽、</p>
<p>設法推銷　上項公債抵押借欵數目及利息期限等、均在接洽中、大致可以成功、因各銀行對於各省建設、極力扶助、尤以公路與復興農村、關係甚大、聞鄂省政府擬向銀行抵押後、同時設法推銷、如人民認購者踴躍、卽將抵押之公債取贖、但决不使其流入市塲、</p>

<p>第六回　　貧女不能羞任敎平視西賓何足貴空辰虚心</p>
<p>不多大一會兒，那門上咚咚的響着，賈多才就答着一句英　。「康閔」於是一陣皮鞋雜踏聲，兩個外國人，隨着兩個中國人，走了進來。這兩中國人，除了李士廉，就是替德國人辦事的趙國富。李士廉先介紹了趙先生，於是趙國富介紹着道：這是密斯脫培爾，這是密斯脫威廉。那培爾是個矮小個子和中國人相等，挖挖的額頭，深窪的眼睛，滿腮的鬢鬍子。威廉是個高大的個兒，高尖鼻子，兩個顴骨上，泛出兩個啤酒製造的紅暈，那便是一種異國情調了。他們挨次的和賈多才握了手，在椅子上坐下，在賈多才心裏想着，他們第一句話，必是說聽到賈先生由西邊而來，我們十分仰慕，特意來拜訪這些話了。不想培爾架了腿坐着，却向屋子　圍上下看了幾遍，這却和趙國富說了兩句話。趙國富翻譯着道：賈先生，你這房間，和我們所住的，差不多大小，是多少錢一天的房錢呢？賈多才很驚訝，怎麽說起這麽一句話來。便答道：西安極貴的旅館，也當不了上海的小客棧，這很便宜，是兩塊錢一天，住得久了，還可以打個七折。培爾於是根據了這旅館費，談了幾句。這在李士廉也有點奇怪了，難道他們是向老賈打聽方金來的。這就不由得向趙國富臉上看了幾看。他也似乎有點感想了，這就向李士廉道：李先生到西安來以後，遊歷過那些名勝呢？李士廉道：此地的敎育廳長，陪我到周陵去遊歷過一次。威廉見他兩人直接的說話，這就問是什麽意思。趙國富道。又轉過身去，向威廉告訴了。（九七）</p>

<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>以感到這樣經濟恐慌的我們貴國，若在平時，大家都是彼此相互敷衍着，撑持着，倘然不幸再遇到什麽變故的時候，那眞是没有辦法了丨像本年夏季各省都遭逢着苦旱，以致農產品的收穫，大大的打了折扣，更有顆粒無收的地方，現在已到了寒冬，這一大羣災黎，非但無食，抑且無衣，飢寒交迫，無以爲生？大家認爲唯一的救濟方策，用來苟延哀鴻的殘喘，那就是「募捐」了。</p>
<p>本來人類是應該有同情心的，反過來說，没有同情心實不能算人！那飽食暖衣的人，或者還會感覺着生活的不舒適，没有珍饈百味嘗，没有綾羅綢緞着啊！我不知他們看到了觸目驚心的災區的圖畫，和聽到了賣男　女及自殺的慘呼聲，應該作何種感想？你若是有惻隱之心的話，在那募捐的當兒，極應當盡力援助，使募得的錢，多一個好一個！</p>
<p>可是災區太廣，災民太多，杯水車薪，欠缺仍多，所以在下又得到二種感想：（一）現在童軍沿街挨戶的勸募，雖已結束，但望那善士仁人，仍本着己飢己渴之心，隨時慨解仁囊，助義粟，送交到收賑處所去，（二）更希望經募諸大善士，涓點歸公，解送到災區去散放，那自然是功德無量！雖然，這也許是作者的過慮吧。</p>

<p>冰冷的被窩，在未睡以前，委實見了有些害怕，每夜反外衣卸去，襪子脫去，睡到被窩以内，祇好反身體蜷縮一團，眞像山野的刺蝟。尤其是雙脚感到奇冷。假使有一隻湯婆子放入被窩内，不久，伊體内的熱力會傳遍你的脚端，溫暖如處女。可是湯婆子也有妍和媸，宜興有陶磁的；像一隻枕頭。蘇洲有雲銅的；像一隻脚爐。江西有磁　器的；像一隻長方匣兒　。日本有橡膠製的；一種腰長體，一種是人形。人形的好像是特製，和人體模特兒一樣，把内心灌了熱水，放在被窩内，眞好似和處女同睡，但是睡的人須尊重自己的人格，不，一定會染上意淫病，倒不如不用的好。不過售價奇昂，每個差不多二十圓日金，在中國的農村，有些地方，二十圓倒可換一個鄕下姑娘啦。</p>
<p>中國上古時代用這些東西了，所以有『夏抱竹夫人，冬擁湯婆子』這兩個美妙的女性代名詞，我恐怕是些孤獨靑年書獃子取來聊慰情懷的吧？可惜不知出於何典？</p>
<h3 id="c154">談呢 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>呢的種類極多。最著的，自然要推直貢呢，華達呢，大衣呢。這，幾乎人人都知道了。它本來是外國貨，近來國人雖有能自製的，然一因種類不多，二因國人喜用外貨，所以外國呢的銷路，依舊很旺，而金錢的外溢，自不待言。呢之所以爲人愛用，回其係毛織品，耐久經穿；并且因它是外國貨，大家遂把它視爲摩登衣料了。觀乎直貢呢有眞假之别，便可證明呢是如何爲人所愛穿呀。</p>
<p>呢自何時始入中國，頗不易考。李慈銘越縵堂日記有一則云：</p>
<p>「買羽織帛圍冠一頂，付直一番金。此帛名曰「呢」，出西洋，人爭服之，不知何故；而朝野又皆制以爲冠。自仲春後，天子用之，幾爲典要矣。」</p>
<p>這段日記，是清同治八年三月十四日所記。細味『此帛名曰「呢」，出西洋』句，可見呢在那時，還是一種新輸入的舶來品。「人爭服之」，可見愛用外國貨者之衆。「不知何故」，實在是很容易明白的，就是大家愛好摩登。「朝野」「製以爲冠」，而曰「又皆」，亦可證明呢初不過作衣料之用；而呢帽的盛行，則在同治八年左右。李先生的「圍冠」是出「一番金」買來的。「一番金」就是一塊洋錢。此數現在視之，似乎很小；然那時的一塊洋錢，足抵現在十塊之用，所以這頂「圍冠」的代價，也是不輕。「自仲春後，天子用这······」云云，足見宮禁中也喜歡外貨，愛好摩登的。統觀全則語氣，似乎呢在清朝同治以前，還没人知道的。</p>
<p>所可慨的，國人愛用外國貨，自昔已然，於今爲烈。就以呢而論，自清同治以至於今，源源輸入；金錢的外溢，正不知有幾千萬元了。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>大仙的確是一個非常尊崇的名號，决非平凡無奇之輩所能輕易取到的！而從那一天起，靑狐大仙便開始替人間醫治起疾病來了：因爲他的法術是非常的精妙，所以它對於隨便什麽疾病，都能醫治得好，於是它的聲譽竟一天一天的盛起來了，後來受惠的人便集資建造了這座狐仙塔，虔誠供奉着。凡有害病的人，只消到那裏去禱告一番，它就會指定幾種藥，敎這病人服，服了十九是有效的」！</p>
<p>太后的故事到這裏已完了。（譯者註：這一段故事顯係作者所杜造，不過造得很有意思，和丹麥的童話大家安徒生所寫的童話很相像，故物譯出）。最後，伊言歸正傳。伊說：</p>
<p>「因爲它有許多的靈蹟，所以我們也不能不去展謁展謁！」</p>
<p>大家聽了太后所講的故事，都覺得很有趣味；雖然我們已不是三四歲的小孩子，聽了這樣的故事，當然能够辨别得出它的眞假！而且還知道爲什麽那個慈悲的玉帝對於那犯罪的狐狸竟是這樣的寬縱，第次不但祇是割掉它一支與生命没有關係的尾巴，且還允許它隔一千年再考查一次；這可不是玉帝放任，而是製造這故事的人的疏忽，或他的思想幼稚。</p>
<p>我們也不願追究這故事畢竟眞到如何程度，假到如何程度？旣然奉天有這麽一處名勝的所在，我們便當然該走一遭的。（二○七）</p>

<p>朱·鎭·蓀·</p>
<p>（一）中學師資訓練之目標</p>
<p>德國中學師資訓練之目標約分爲三種、第一種爲訓練中學敎師對於敎材的熟諳、這是德國中學敎師的必需條件中之一種、在一千八百一十年普魯斯施行檢定資格考試時、即開始規定這種條件、自從那時以後、牠便成爲一種牢固不破的相沿的慣例、所以德國著名的敎育史學家普爾遜（pvlson）常說、「中學敎師的團體是一個博學的團體」、那意思就是說中學的敎師對於所有的敎材應當澈底明瞭和切實的熟諳、不然、他便不配去敎學生、這種相沿的慣例雖經大戰後十年的重估價値、但迄今仍然存在、且較以前更爲鞏固、</p>
<p>德國自歐戰以後的中學敎育的改革、在學生方面着重有組織的自動的活動的要素、在敎師方面則培養眞正有學識和有道德的領袖資格、例如、在高級的中學裏面常反對歐戰前的呆板的練習工作、武斷的敎學法、和官塲上的習氣、這種新的精神顯示需要眞實不苟的學識、以作中學敎師被選資格的先决條件、這種改革似乎有以下的理由、</p>
<p>學生的自動的活動及團體研究式的敎學如要產生可能的結果、勢必須要一種上等有學識的領袖丨敎師的感化與指導、假使學生得不到富有高深學識的敎師的感化與指導、則自動的活動的要素勢必由退化而變爲浪漫、這種感化和指導凡富有眞正學識和　研究興趣的敎師眞接或間接在班級敎學時可以施與的、</p>
<p>其次、中學敎師應有切實不苟的學識俾負科學上的重大責任、現代的世紀雖可說是一個科學的世紀但是亦可以說是一個假科學的世紀、因爲每種科學上如政治上和社會上的運動進行時、往往不免含有煽動的作用、所以中學校中的最主要工作中的一種乃在領導學生反抗一切科學上的煽動、如要達到這種目的、中國敎師應具有各方面的深切知識、俾能指導學生、區别眞科學與假科學之不同點、</p>
<p>德國中學師資訓練的第二種目標爲對中學敎師授以哲學上的知識、根據德國一般學者的意見、中學敎師應研究哲學、有下面兩種理由、（甲）因爲哲學具有並通文化上的重要地方、中學敎師是成年的和未成年人的領袖、所以他們應具有各種高尙的價値、如道德上的、科學上的、和政治上的、且對於人生應有一種高尙的展望、他們對於知識學、玄學和倫理學上的切實基本問題亦應知道、對於現在人類的地位亦須了解、他們還應凖備導靑年在他們固有的迫切中養成眞美善的理想、所以、有系統的哲學的研究對於中學敎師履行他們敎育上的責任的適當素養是必需的、（乙）中學敎師其所以要研究哲學是因爲哲學與敎育學頗有密切的關係、例如、敎育的理想與實際即是哲學與敎育學的關係的一種證明牠們彼此之關係、近頗爲完形心理學所注重、所以完形心理學有使敎育心理學的重心脫離自然科學而回到心理學的哲學方面的傾向、</p>
<p>德國中學師資訓練的第三種目標乃在授予中學敎師敎育學上的知識、因爲在中學裏面對於科學的敎育異常注意、同時各種敎學　已由注入式的而改變爲啟發式的、中學敎師爲要適應這種新的要求、非有敎育學上的知識不可、可是德國大學供給充分敎育理讑的科目的、爲數甚多、敎育理讑的科目多半是設立於哲學院中的、在德國大學中找不着一個獨立的敎育學院、所以大學裏面對於培養中學師資往往只不過設立一科敎育實際的理讑的入門而已、但是在德國大學中敎學科目設立最多的要推柏林大學、以下爲一九三一至一九三二年柏林大學中所設立的敎育學程、</p>

<p>下半時起、羣華變更戰略、蕭譚兩後、衛左右逢迎、儼如天塹朱烔培坐鎭中原威風人面、使敵方氣餒、一籌莫展、嗣後鐵華内衛犯規、判罰十二碼、羣華梁耀鴻脚頭一起、正中紅心、中點開球後、羣華前鋒更形活躍、幸鐵華守門後衛、均能應付得當、化險爲夷、然守而不攻、終非上策、羣華右翼周本芳帶球疾上被阻、即行傳中、鄧錦堃得球、盤近門前、一脚送入、此後鐵華軍心渙散、而敵方亦以勝利在握、不爲已甚、於是一塲决賽遂宣告閉幕、而第一屆之乙組杯、亦爲羣華隊永久保持矣、羣華陣綫如右、</p>

<p>上半時二比一維華勝</p>
<p>下半時兩隊各無所獲</p>
<p>復旦與維華甲組、兩隊在本屆中華會中字組中、並稱兩雄、參戰以來、皆未敗北、維華挫眞茹商船樂濟、而三戰三勝、復旦亦克商船樂濟而兩戰兩捷、故昨日兩隊相搏於復旦球塲、不啻一幕决賽焉、是日雖寒風颯颯、彤雲密佈、然幕兩隊之名而作壁上觀者、數七百有奇、而復旦同學更衆、啦啦呐喊之聲、震霄徹耳、盛况一時、結果維華以二對一小勝、茲誌其詳情如下、</p>
<p>周達雲屢救險球　復旦昨日整刷陣容、馮念漢改充右翼、程世昌出任左翼、故前鋒進玫力量大增、三時半周家騏鳴笛啟賽、初維華攻擊極盛、竺小榮·符質彬等屢次攻門、均爲周達雲關泃安等拒之門外、俄而馮念漢邊陲起義、盤送中央、唐賢軫略遲疑、球逸門外、嘆聲起於四座、俄然復旦攻勢並未稍殺、唐賢軫送程世昌、程勾向中央、余順章脫穎而出、衝過後衛、以爽脆脚頭、擊入門角、首肇記錄焉、</p>
<p>維華隊連中兩球　維華經此奇辱、傾師反攻一次李昌熾在離門十八碼處犯規、許竟成主罰任意球、周達雲接得、被衝倒地、球遂滾入網中、平手旣成、劇戰更烈、復旦前鋒猖獗異常、惜脚頭欠凖良機每失交臂、不久、復旦後衛不戒於手、被罰十二碼、竺小榮主踢、周達雲仆地救出、掌聲雷動、上半時終了前數分鐘、維華黃金貴單槍匹馬、殺入禁地、飛足猛射、又告中的、上半時終了、維華以二比一勝、</p>
<p>下半時各無建樹　再戰聲中、復旦以楊榮華陸秀文任兩兾、馮念漢退守中衛、以代李昌熾、防守力量大增、前鋒乃一意進攻、藉洗前恥、於是維華門前、鐵騎縱橫、險象頻仍、一次、余順章於千軍萬馬之中、奪得阿斗、向後一勾、吳祺祥身手矯捷、願以償、時光易逝、四十五分鐘、輕易過去、周家騏銀笛長嘯之下、一幕劇戰、於焉告終、</p>

<p>— 汪企張演講　陳生白江晦鳴筆記</p>
<p>吾國醫學敎育過去如何？現在又如何？將來更如何？國内醫學敎育専家罕論及此、故今日中國这醫學敎育，與其將來趨勢，猶加霧罩廬山、其面目頗難一識，十一月二十三日承汪企張先生蒞校演講，對於吾國醫育過去現在與將來之得失，指示綦詳，尤對現在醫育之危機，發揮更多，若撥雲霧，其補偏救弊之法，正切中肯綮，殊足發人深省，爰記投本刋，以備關心醫學敎育者之參考。記者識於上海東南醫學院</p>
<p>一　中國醫育建設的困難</p>
<p>諸位：假使在空白的地上造一座房子，和把舊房子拆掉再造一座新房子，拿這兩種工程來比較一下、前者只有建設，没有破壞：後者先要破壞，而後攙能建設，其難易自是不同。</p>
<p>中國有四五千年的歷史，自古就是文化之邦，一切的學術在古代可以說都早有了。比方像醫學之有神農黃帝……，工學之有魯班，公輸子，列子……其他若農若商的歷史，更是多不勝舉。因爲自己雖有固有的文化，若拿世界各國的文化史比較來看：論出世的宗敎思想，中國民族不如印度民族與希伯來民族；論形而上學，中國民族又不及希臘民族與日耳曼民族：論自然科學思想：中國更不能與近世西歐各國相提並論。醫學，是屬於自然科學的範圍的，所以要把中國的醫學完全改造成科學的醫學，當然，先要除去中國固有的許多不合科學的障碍東西，而後纔能取世界的科學的學問歸爲己有：換句話說：先要經過一番破壞工作，第二步纔能談到建設，因此，就成爲一件很困難的事情了。</p>
<p>二　外國文化輸入之目的</p>
<p>在没有講到本題正文以前，我們應先有了解國外科學輸入之目的的必要。國外科學的文化，所以要輸入的目的，大略不外：</p>
<p>（一）侵略的，被動的，本來我們並不需要，而他們却要强迫的輸送進來。他們的鵠的，是想在目的國内握取工商業經濟上的權威，和假名傳敎以爲政治上的活動。</p>
<p>（二）覺悟的，自動的，需要的，因爲自己的文化本不够，也許竟没有，也許不及人家，在相形見拙之下，自覺的定要拿它來補充，改革，這可以說完全是國家的眞文化。國民的眞學問。</p>
<p>三　過去的中國醫學敎育</p>
<p>照上面所講來觀察：現在的中國敎育，的確已發生了重大的問題。因思自海禁開通以來，外國卽用種種的方法來施展其侵略的手段。譬如：先之以通商，繼之以傳敎，通商的目的是謀經濟上的侵略：傳敎的目的，也無非含有政治上的企圖：當然這所謂文化的輸入，更未嘗不是侵略政策之一！所以我敢說：國際上是没有道德，没有公理，也没有學術上的貢獻的；就是有，那麽一定有背景，有作用。大都蒙着一副假面具，不過技俩上優拙的不同而已。至於醫學，雖然表面上是博愛並濟，無種族的軒輊，無國家的軫域，任何人民，任何區域，都是一視同仁的，可是在骨子裏，還是假的，有色彩的。我恨說：外國人到中國來敎育的目的，絲毫没有眞實的心腸，都是笑裏藏刀，口蜜腹劍，做欺騙人的敎育。像紅十字會不是拿博愛普濟來標榜的麽？可是當戰爭的時候，那一國不是先救護本國的傷兵和自己的人民呢？中國醫學敎育，辦理到現在，不可不說已有相當之歷史，但是，覺悟的，自動的有多少？我敢說：左右是完全受着列强的支配，和外國人的統制的。</p>
<p>敎育有兩種：</p>
<p>（一）殖民敎育　這就是被動的侵略的敎育，是異化Dessimilation的敎育。</p>
<p>（二）國民敎育　這是自動的學悟的敎育，是同化Assimijation的敎育。</p>
<p>我們回想過去外國人所敎育的中國醫生是怎樣？大都是些敎堂裏的僱僮、外人趁傳敎的時候，就拿些東西來敎敎他們，讀完了一册簡單的書本，記幾樣藥名，就可以當醫生，在幾個敎會醫院混過日子的看護，照樣有文憑給他們定下資格，且在社會上有優越的地位給他們享受。從這幾點看來，過去的中國醫學敎育，是外人的侵略的敎育，是異化的敎育，是徒然多加外國人的爪牙，與以博得政治上經濟上侵略的便利！</p>
<h3 id="c184">現在餘姚新醫界狀况 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 于振家</p>
<p>交通···新醫界···慈善機關···醫師程席···診金藥資···產科···新醫團體</p>
<p>（一）交通　餘姚爲富庶之區。北沿杭州灣。西連上虞。南達鄞縣爲隣。東與慈谿交界。分劃七區。陸有滬杭甬鐵路。又有餘周勝·滸·周·曹公路。水道有汽輪·快船。交通頗稱便利。</p>
<p>（二）新醫界　民國元年後。新醫人材缺少。兼之民智簡淺。對於開業醫師無認識。對於醫院含有恐懼觀念。雖邑有敎會醫院一所。六區永濟醫院。四區有留日醫師組織病院。醫務均未十分發達。逾年。四區病院遷移去姚。延民十後。新醫人材輩出。内地開業醫師漸增。民衆信仰之心亦漸濃厚。例如馬渚·四門·臨山滸山·歷山·周巷·長河市庵東·等鎭。漸次發達矣。</p>
<p>雖然。信仰新醫屬智識界占多。惜竟不能超過舊式思想之家屬。餘姚新醫人材。資格平均。醫務雖佳。更難勝過舊醫。民衆之衣·食·住要素·尙不合現代衛生原理。推論全國。姑無論之。欲民族健康。欲深信科學醫常識。欲解决内地開業困難者。賴賢明執政。曁醫界同道。共同澈底之。</p>
<p>（三）慈善機關　（一）四門握姚北巨鎭。向設有同春醫局。診金藥資全免。越八年。究因人智不　。雖以免費。而就診仍屬寥寥。故乃停辦。然實地爲民衆施診　藥者。捨同春醫局外。餘無繼起。良可嘆也。</p>
<p>（二）民十五。全縣時疫流行。四門地方人士。嘆死亡率之高。歷年罕見。特組織時疫醫院。經三月。活命三千餘人。殆二十一年。疫癘復熾。縣邑四門·臨山·組織臨時時疫醫院。周巷等鎭。亦相繼組織防疫醫院。顧時疫醫院歷史。首推四門。而宣傳民衆信仰新醫力之深。亦推四門。誰曰否認之。</p>
<p>（四）醫師程度　學校畢業者。約二十餘名。國内外畢業者均有。但正式醫屫。在縣内開業者。僅五六名。其他亦由各大醫院出身。醫師道德觀念亦佳。無派别分歧。無登吹廣告以號召病家者。</p>
<p>（五）診金藥資　診金···開業醫師。診金不滿半元占多。免收者有之。（正式醫院平均二角左右）故貧病家都能均沾其惠。</p>
<p>藥資···内地開業醫師。須自備藥物。猶血清者。稍備緊要實用者居多。内服藥劑（二日量）。不滿五角。注射黃色素九一四祇收元餘之譜，與都市新醫不同之點也。</p>
<p>（六）產科　爲民衆特設平民產科部者。如惠愛永濟及四門同春醫院。不過難產以外。普通顧問者鮮有。四區擬設平民產科社之舉。籌募基金。召聘人材。屆期。爲社會造福非淺。助產婦均由國内畢業。凡幾十位。取資亦賤。惜不能十分普及。無知產婦家。對於助產者含有恐懼及羞恥之心理。故腦海中無助產者思想。寗捐生命於穩婆·舊醫·迷信。雖死而舞怨言。可勝慨嘆。</p>
<p>（七）新醫團體　餘姚新醫人材具有資格者雖多。如醫師公會。醫藥分會等。惟均無組織。雖有提議。議而不决。决而不行。成爲縣議。回顧舊醫。頗有團結之能力。吾輩新醫。竟而落後。故欲堅固新醫基礎。欲科學醫之日新。欲導灌民衆衛生之使命。匪組織團體不可。否則。徒爲仇者訕笑。同道先進。有何敎言於余耶。</p>
<h3 id="c185">發熱普通治療法 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>腸一出血病人的飲食就當完全停止。口過乾時可飲水少許以止口乾爲目的。病人務靜臥，越少動越好。靜脈注射葡萄糖水。注射嗎啡减去腸蠕動亦有益不小。口服綠化鈣，皮下這射三十四十西西自己或别人的血可使血快擬結而停止腸流血。少量輸血也有極大效用。出血完全停止後，病人可漸漸進飲食由極小量漸漸復原。以上爲最近治療傷寒病法的最重要機點。前已詳述各種治發熱病的普通方法。茲因限於篇幅與本題的範圍不能盡述一切治療傷寒病的方法。</p>
<p>（一）肺癆　癆病是一種長期發熱的病，並且是一種發熱最長的病，發熱常是經月經年。故治療也必須以長遠效果爲目的。病家必須認識癆病是一種嚴重的病。治療也必須盡心竭力。付相當的代價，才能有相當的成效。茲略述治療法。</p>
<p>（一）休息　重癆須臥床靜養。輕癆亦當停止操作。重癆須日夜臥床，大小便也不要起床。休息也必須身心，卽身體臥床腦筋也要停止憂慮與一切計劃。完全休息直到熱度停止後數星期再照恢復期間治療法實行（法詳前）。</p>
<p>（二）飲食　飲食務救滋養料充足，容易消化。病人必須有相當的飲食因爲滋養料與抵抗成正比例。滋養食物須米麵食物與肉類牛乳靑菜水果等平均合宜有人以。類滋養豐富，盡吃肉爲肉類也</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>是不對的。食物只要米麵類佔十之六七，其餘佔十之三四。</p>
<p>（三）空氣　病很輕的可擇戶外職業。病勢不過重的也可以在戶外坐，散步，或飲食亦在外。夏日每日當有十小時之久，冬日也當有六小時之久。注意不要病人受冷受熱。病重的當將病床安置在晒台上或窗戶廠開的室中，只要避免風雨。冬日蓋厚不要怕冷空氣。須知新鮮空氣爲治療肺癆最要緊的原素。</p>
<p>（四）治高熱度　熱度高務靜養。飲食務求滋養料够身體消耗而有餘，退熱方法以水療法爲最宜。熱度不過高的一日洗身一兩次，額上加冷濕墊。病室新鮮空氣流通。熱度高時可另外用濕被單包身。</p>
<p>以上爲治療肺癆幾重要點。望病家特别注意實行。其餘還有不少發熱病但没有傷寒與癆病這樣要緊，照發熱普通治療法實行可也。</p>
<p>給論</p>
<p>本篇已詳述治療發熱的學理。因求適合於任何發熱病故題爲發熱普通治療法。病家如能精心研究按法實行當能受益不小。茲將本篇綢要提出俾讀者能以一目了然。</p>
<p>（一）發熱由於細菌與身内抵抗力戰爭之結果。不應當單求退熱，應當求除去病原因。</p>
<p>（二）治療第一急務卽靜養丨丨臥床，身心休息。病室清潔安靜，新鮮空氣流通。睡眠充足楫其要緊。</p>
<p>（三）飲食　飲料充足。病人不能喝水時須用洋射法。食物應當多屬流質。病人不睡眠時大約每兩小時一小餐，每餐食物數種。發熱時身内消耗比平時多一兩倍，故食物的滋養料也必須等於消耗，身體的細胞才能不損揀。</p>
<p>（四）口部衛生　病人每飯後應當刷牙嗽口，牙粉牙膏可用。口氣味重時用雙餐水與水各半洗口。牙刷不能用時可以之包紗布代牙刷。</p>
<p>（五）皮膚衛生　每日至少用肥皂清水洗身一次。熱度高時一日兩三次。</p>
<p>（六）腸胃衛生　注意食物容易消化。</p>
<p>（七）心理衛生　安心養病，不求僥倖，不迷信，求正當治療法。</p>
<p>（八）水療退熱　與身體臟　益無害。普通水療法爲（一）額上加冷濕墊。（二）濕被單包身。（三）撒水退熱。（四）濕被單浴。（五）半身浴。（六）全身浴。</p>
<p>（九）帮助内部排洩　服利小便講與身有益。</p>
<p>（十）藥物治療　目的當减去痛苦。没有疼痛不可用藥物退熱。這些藥品雖可退熱但同時也减低抵抗力，故不可長期服退熱藥，並不且過多。</p>
<p>（十）（一）急救昏絕　口服或注射强心劑。帮助血流到四肢不使聚在腹部。</p>
<p>（十）（二）恢復期間治療法　病人初愈不可急停止休養。按照普通定律，發熱停後，發過熱三天的再休息三天，發過熱三個月的再休息三個月，才恢復原來工作。喉痧後，星紅熱腎炎後特别延長休養時期。</p>
<p>（十）（三）治療法實用○（一）傷寒病應當特别注意靜養。特别注意食物無渣滓（靑菜硬食物不可吃，）容易消化，多流質，滋養料充足。注意水療退高熱度。腸出血須暫時停止飲食。出血完全停止後漸漸飲食。</p>
<p>（十）（四）癆病發熱務注意靜養。也要特别注意滋養料充足，食物容易消化，新鮮空氣太陽光越多越好。</p>
<p>（十）（五）其餘發熱病照普通治療原理實行可也。（完）</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四十九）腸壅塞症（上）</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做腸壅塞症？</p>
<p>（答）腸壅塞症是因爲腸管不通或通過困難而起的臨症上種種症狀。</p>
<p>（問）腸壅塞症的原因是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）腸壅塞症的原因，可分爲兩大類。就是器械的和機能的二類。</p>
<p>（問）器械的壅塞原因，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）器械的壅塞原因也是很多。第一是腸内的搆造上變化，像先天性素質，如肛門閉鎖，直腸狹窄，胎兒期腹膜炎而致小腸狹窄等，又像腸癌，潰瘍性腸狹窄等。第二是因爲腸管外的壓迫像卵巢囊腫，子宮腫瘍，骨盆膿瘍，網膜囊腫，遊走的腎和脾，栢爾氏病，氣體壅塞等。</p>
<p>（問）器械的壅塞，此外還有其他的原因嗎？</p>
<p>（答）還有腸管的篏頓，絞榨，轉捩、　積等情。</p>
<p>（問）機能的壅塞原因是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）機能的壅塞原因，第一是麻痺性的壅塞，像急性廣泛性膓膜炎時往往併發，或長時間的開膓因而腸管冷却，或因膓膜出血，激劇的胆石，或腎結石疝痛，膓部腫瘍莖的捩轉，睪丸外傷，腹壁强衝突，胰腺壞死，脊髓損傷，腸血管拴塞或血拴，膓水穿刺等而起。又有因爲腸管的一時不全麻痺，也得起的。第二是痙攣性的壅塞，像鉛中毒，　躁性患者，開膓術後，或迷走神經過於興奮都得起的。</p>
<p>（問）腸壅塞症的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）病狀是關於發生的原因的；所以有閉鎖性，絞窄性，麻痺性，和痙攣性的分别。</p>
<p>（問）閉鎖性腸壅塞症的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這就是腸狹窄或至閉塞。於是閉塞的上部腸管内容停滯，膨脹。如果腸管居然能打通狹窄，而内容輸送的時候，那腸管的蠕動亢進，腹面現出蠕動不安之狀。在腸内的膨脹部，因爲消化產物和分泌液相混，發生氣體。這些氣體，被不整的腸運動所震盪而發生種種雜音。腸管的蠕動不規則而致引起腹痛。又因爲狹窄或閉塞而致鬰滯的腸内容愈積愈多，上達胃内，妨礙胃的機能，起噯氣和嘔吐。腸壁因爲膨脹過度而致菲薄。腸黏膜，被腸内毒性產物的腐蝕而起潰瘍，若潰瘍達深部，可以使腸破裂。</p>
<p>（問）絞窄性腸壅塞症的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在初期，病者的腸，蠕動亢進，内容起空虚的現象；若程度增高，那末神經就失掉管理運動的能力，於是促進腸内氣體的發生，絞窄部膨脹，終致穿孔。動脈在起初的時候，比較的不被侵害，祗是靜脈受障礙，阻止血液的通路，於是在腸管，腸壁，腸間膜，腸内容等處，滲出血性黏液。二十四到四十八小時内呈暗靑色，陷於腸壞疽。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c187">瘧疾槪述 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 王曉嵐</p>
<p>瘧疾病原</p>
<p>瘧疾病原體爲瘧原虫，可分間日瘧原虫，三日瘧原虫，惡瘧原虫三種前二種較大，後者較小皆以瘧蚊爲宿主人類爲其中間宿主，寄生人體，祗行無性生殖，在瘧蚊體内則行兩性生殖。但在蚊體，須溫度超過攝氏表十一度，方能發育，故冬令瘧不傳染。瘧蚊傳瘧虫於人體，每在刺吮時隨唾液入血，攻據紅血球中，消化血色素，使成林拉林（Mielanin）色素。漸次發育增大，迨其成熟，遂裂自體爲多數之芽蚴，冲潰舊血球，分覔新血球據入，反復發育分裂，在人體内不行雌雄接合，故曰無性生殖。</p>
<p>在人血内發育分裂，攻據新紅血球之芽蚴，就中有一部分，發育爲雌性或雄性之生殖球，間日瘧及三日瘧者，多呈球狀，惟惡瘧則呈半月狀，此等生殖球，不在人體内成熟，須再經瘧蚊吮入胃中，始離血球，發育爲雌雄兩種之生殖體，更由雄生殖體，發生鞭毛狀物，與成熟之雌生殖體接合姙孕，於蚊胃搆成卵囊，俟其成熟，復分裂爲多數之芽呦，經過淋巴道及血道移入唾腺，當刺吮人血將隨唾液侵入人體。瘧原虫在瘧蚊體内生殖，係由雌雄兩性接合，故曰兩性生殖。</p>
<p>間日瘧虫，散見於我國各地，在紅血球内運動活潑，約四十八小時成熟，每次分裂芽蚴十五至二址個。其寄生之血球，較尋常者略大，產生黑色素甚多。三日瘧虫，多散漫於中部及南部諸省。在血球中不運動，祇產生之黑色素顆粒，營分子運動，約七十二小時成熟，每次分裂芽蚴九至十二個。惡瘧原虫，多見於中部及南部諸省，北方間亦發生，其成熟期不齊，約自二十四小時至四十八小時。每次分裂芽蚴七至十二個，惟裂殖常於脾，肝，骨髓，腦等部行之，寄生之血球，較尋常者爲小，產生黑色素亦少。</p>
<p>傳瘧媒介</p>
<p>傳瘧之媒介爲蚊，我國常見者，以庘雷（Culex）及安那斐雷（Anopheles）二族之蚊爲多。庘雷蚊乃禽瘧媒介，與人類染病無關，故假名爲普通蚊。安那斐雷蚊乃人瘧媒介，故假名爲瘧蚊。現今全球已發見之瘧蚊，有二百餘種，就中證明能傳瘧者，僅五十餘種，一九二九年法司特（Fanst）氏報告，謂我國已發見之瘧蚊，僅十四種，合近數年之報告，亦不過二十種。其證明能傳瘧者，有三種，在北方各省山地傳瘧之主要媒介，爲潘氏瘧蚊，（A·Pattcni）全國平原區域爲中華瘧蚊，（A·hyrcanusvar·sinensis)南方各省，則爲微小瘧蚊，（Anophelesmininus）</p>
<p>瘧蚊與普通蚊異，其觸角長與喙等，翅有黑白斑紋，體呈灰色，腿部具白環或白點，當棲止時，身與喙成直線，下腹遠離璧面，與附着處作交角，狀如弩箭釘壁，足多下垂，所產之卵，形如棗核、，散例不相沾黏。子氶居水面時，身體與之平行，無椎狀呼吸管，具棕葉狀毛。蛹之呼吸管，短而口闊。普通蚊觸角較短，翅無斑點，棲止時身，與壁平或尾壁面，後足曲至背上，所產之卵，叢集如舟，子氶具細長之椎狀呼吸管，無棕葉狀毛，居水面時，尾近水面，頭部向下斜垂，蛹之呼吸管長而口小。</p>
<p>瘧蚊喜低飛，畏風及日光，晝藏夜出，多孶生於清水生藻之河澤池沼中，雄者専吸植物液汁，雌者吮血，瘧原虫僅有性生殖體，能在瘧蚊體内發育，無性生殖體入期胃中卽消化無伊，據介姆（JamesI926）氏研究，謂人體罹瘧十餘日，血中始見有性生殖體，馬賴（MalanangI931）氏報告，則謂每立方粍血中，須含惡瘧生殖體四十二個，或間日瘧生殖體十個，方能使瘧蚊感染瘧蚊自吸血入胃至唾腺中發現芽蚴，在攝氏二十五度時，約經八至十日，氣溫較低，須歷十四至十八日，若降至十五度下，瘧虫卽停止發育。</p>
<p>瘧疾病理</p>
<p>瘧原虫由瘧蚊介入人血，分裂繁殖，迨血液每立方粍内含虫數百個，始現病徵，發病後，每逢瘧虫裂殖，芽蚴潰入血中，以其產生之母毒素，刺激血管運動神經中樞，惹起反應，病者遂感寒熱發作。故裂殖入血之新芽蚴，有催熱體之稱，間日瘧或三日瘧將發作時，如檢查血液，可見瘧原虫之分裂體，在發作後檢血，始可見其環狀體，但惡瘧原虫在肝，脾，腦，骨髓各部裂殖者，雖於發作之初檢血，每不易發見其分裂體。在瀕死之重症，瘧虫多積滯於血内，極易檢出，甚至各個血球中，均見存在。</p>
<p>罹瘧者體内各藏器發現病徵，以脾臟爲最著，槪因瘧原虫與其產生之黑色素滯積所致，脾臓重量，通常約一五○克，罹瘧後，能增至千克以上，當發熱時，充血增大，熱退縮小，疚瘧則脾材增殖，硬固不消，我國俗稱瘧母。瘧原虫及復裂殖，血球破潰不已，血色素耗失，每致貧血，疚瘧則成瘧惡液質，他若骨髓，肝臓，腎臓，淋巴腺各部，亦因瘧原虫及黑色素滯積，致骨髓呈暗黑色，或現肝　黃疸腎充血等病象，若瘧原虫與黑色素充塞腦微血管，更能引起昏迷痙攣等重險之神經症狀。</p>
<p>瘧原虫之種類各異，病者對於甲種雖具有免疫力，但對於乙種，仍屬無效，可藉蚊螫接種法或輸血接種法，傳染瘧疾以證明之。柯赫（Koch）氏曾查非洲東海岸黑兒之血，無不含有瘧虫，年齡漸長，含數漸少，最後僅遺脾腫，然發病者甚稀，或症狀極微，至成丁後，殆不染發，謂其具有天然免疫性。又台灣瘧疾盛行之區，台人發病甚輕，旅居之日僑，多呈重症，亦因土著者自幼具有相當免疫力之故，但罹瘧者之免疫力，不能久存，素居瘧疾盛行區域，染瘧不顯病徵之人，若離開日久，再返該地，仍易感發。（未完）</p>

<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>（四）　血液的檢查</p>
<p>除開上列形態的血液圖像外，對於紅血球沈降的遲速，也是診斷上一個很緊要的問題。這一種速度測量的報告，據Linsenmcier氏檢查法，尋常男子約六百分鐘，女子約二百至三百五十分鐘。他對於肺結核症，並没有専門性的價値。像發高熱諸炎性症，惡性瘤腫，骨折，梅毒諸症；以及尋常的懷孕，和病灶的組織毁壞；都能使速　增加，和本症的情形有時是差不多的。所以這種檢查在本症上的價値，並不是有無是否的辨别。我們所藉以分明的，就是：本症是否在急性進行期中？抑病灶已至靜息狀態？此種然否的判斷，對於本症的診斷，固没有我大關係：但在本症預後方面良惡的揣測，以及當時治療和療養的方針，完全是據此而準的。此外，這種檢查，照例是五六星期後重複的：這也可以和以前作一比較。並知此短期内病勢如何？是否較前進步？此種治療是否有効果？這種對於本病直正的認識，有助於臨床上症象的報告，以及物理方面檢查之所得，都是很大的。</p>
<p>關於血清反應的法子，在本病診斷上的價値是狠微薄的：至於血液中檢查結核菌，又因血色素阻其增殖的關係，也没有狠大的成績。此中的詳情，當然非一般人所可領略的，所以此處也一槪節去不講。（血液檢查完）</p>

<h3 id="c189">談生活態度 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>有島武郎曾把人的生活態度分爲三類：一是追憶過去生活的美夢的，是屬於回憶的，一是渴慕未來生活的美夢，是屬於幻想的，一是重視現在生活的，屬於所謂「人」的；關於第三類他曾說：</p>
<p>『過去的生活，無論怎樣地美好，總是已經過去，未來的生活，無論怎樣地堂皇富麗，畢竟是還没有來到，所以認定現在的價値爲無上的高，要出全力去求它。</p>
<p>抱着前二類的生活態度的人們，想是犯着不肯思索的毛病，或者說是被所謂「思索的惰性」所麻痺了；要是稍稍動一下腦經，這道理眞是淺明可見了。所謂「過去」卽是從前的現在，而「未來」是將來的現在，簡而言之，過去與未來都是現在的化身。</p>
<p>因了不滿於現在的緣故，就開始沉進了回憶和幻想的境界中；大抵沉溺在這種境界中的人們，其在過去，曾不會感過滿足的，儘管於現在說着夢囈似的讚揚過去的話，對於未來，同樣地將感覺不滿，雖然於現在却口口聲聲地崇稱未來；無論是憶過去或追求未來，對於現在生活的滿足是永遠地不會獲得的；那些被美夢所誘惑的人們，於是乎很可憐憫地頽然而老，踱盡了一生暗淡的生活，由於這一點的關係，他們一生是决無成績可言的，他們的精神與肉軀是同時告亡的。</p>
<p>人們之間，似乎流行着一種通病，總覺得已失或未得的事物爲貴，並以需求的高低和獲得的難易爲「正比」的，這許是織成過去或未來的生活美夢原因之一。而且在懷念已往的人們，常常把過去生活的缺陷，全然忘了，却把它的細小、</p>
<p>美好處，在意識裏逐漸擴大，於是出現了種種「非人間」的境界；對於渴慕未來的人們，似乎在更進一層地去找尋他們的「仙鄕」，連一綫的根據都没有了。他們遠離了現實的社會，不僅不爲推進社會的齒輪，却間接地响影了人類的進展。</p>
<p>不論人類進步到如何程度，人間的缺陷將永恒地存在着。但也有因爲這缺陷的緣故，引起他們對於現世生活的不滿，一件美滿的事情，總隨着或多或少的缺陷。廚川白村曾寫過一篇關於「缺陷」的文章，警關異常，大意謂缺陷的存在，實足以襯示美滿的存在，一般常引缺陷爲遣憾的人們，應該明白了這一點意思。對於現世生活的不滿，還有一個原因，應在此提到的，就是人類的慾望是没有止境的，且愈陷愈深；如因爲慾望未能塡滿而引以爲苦的意思，那是非常謬誤的了。</p>
<p>作家LymanAbbot的生活態度，在他一篇名爲Which　Both的文章裏有過這樣的意思：『我們到這個世界裏來，决不該像住在旅館裏那樣安閒適意，悠然的躺在沙發上，享受着精美的飯餐，有着那樣的周到的服役，要什麽只消按一下電鈴；我們入世應該像走進醫院，有許多病人待我們去診治，那裏祗有困苦與疾病。』抱着這樣嚴肅的生活態度，是極可貴的；這種態度也可說是解除現世生活的煩惱的唯一路途。</p>
<p>還有一種富有風趣的生活態度，就是吟咏生活與咀嚼生活，在「獄中記」裏似乎寫過，以鐐鍊的聲音，聽作美妙的音樂的事情；這不是頗有意味的麽？</p>

<p>河中的水浪打着河岸的「嘩啦啦」的響聲，這時更聽得顯亮，而可怕。去過灌輸在腦子里的關们河灘的驚人的傳聞，使我懷抱着最大的戒心，楞怔着，茫然地翹望着周圍，忘掉了寒風的刺骨，我們互相觀望着，經過最後一次的猶豫，張君掮我那較大的行李捲，追着别的兩個客人馳去。</p>
<p>「掂着箱子跟來吧！」他忙亂地命令着我。</p>
<p>張君力大體壯，皮膚粗黑，抖然望去，很像個莊稼人。我正爲着行李作難。他只隨身　隻手提箱。背後的同伴在驚恐中趕來。我眞想不到他們是從哪里來的蠻勁兒　，能把很大的柳條包掮在肩上，若在平素，要他們提也會提行起；如今却能若無其事地向前奔馳，直待　過别人方敢扔在地下，作一個短促的休息。没命地跑着，肚子里懷着鬼胎，相信背後有「嚮馬」在追趕。那狡獪的上年紀的船家，强悍，粗野的水手：他們便是。我們全然　在他們的圈套里丨丨否則他們爲什麽不將我們送到碼頭，而在這里，荒野的這里把我們　上岸呢？命運的巨爪抓住了我們别别跳躍的心。可是我們並不甘願就此任他們宰割，還企圖脫逃，盡自己的能力掙扎。因爲我只提着只小手提箱，與張君跑在前面，心是比較安靜的，即令如是，什麽風，什麽明月，脚下的凸凹，波浪打着河岸的駭人的怒吼，業已全然顧計不到了，所能記憶的，便是跟躍走在前面的人的足跡。此外，往往會疑惑背後的同件是「嚮馬」，吓出渾身冷汗。</p>
<p>「里邊走！聽！」</p>
<p>張君用粗野的聲調吭呌，命令我不要靠近河岸，命令我「聽」。突然，我注意到波浪在岸下所作的丨丨「嘩啦啦」怒吼中，時時挾着彷彿山崩似的「巨響」，由百前不斷的河沿送來。我明白了船家所以不能把我們送到碼　頭的理由。一個記憶，閃電似地在腦子里一恍丨！黃河攤起來，一氣兒便數十里，縱然騎在馬上，仍不足以逃出的嚇人的傳說。下意地向灘内跑。同時在心里想着，這只不過是徒盡人事，被攤入那滾滾怒吼波浪中是必然了。</p>
<p>「小心脚下」！又是一個暴躁的驚告。</p>
<p>橫在面前的是一塊墳地，離河沿大約只有五六十步遠近，爲了黃河馬上就會滾來，將它攤入河身的緣故，孝子賢孫業將祖先的骨骸起出，運往安全地帶，遺留着一個挨一個的空穴。我們小心地由高隆的穴與穴的梭頭上踏過。不久，便聽到背後攤塌的巨響，我即認定，所攤的正是那塊墳地。</p>
<p>「你見唿哨嗎」？</p>
<p>跟在背後的一個同伴，用壓低而沉着的微聲詰問。他受驚而睜得骨碌碌的雙眼，在月光下閃閃發亮。</p>
<p>「你聽到唿哨嗎」？我返問了一聲，同時也在詢問自己。我也許聽到，也許也没，答不出。他說他確是聽到的丨兩聲。那末，我也就斷定我也曾聽到。唿哨是「嚮馬」聚集的信號，接着要來的是什麽呢？我們深深感覺到，而更加連了脚步，聳着耳朶小心地向周圍搜查，看有無動靜。</p>
<p>一些些工夫，背後有鋼鐵相碰的「鏘鏘」的響聲給我們發現了。「什麽」？馬上回答自己的是「刀」！有好多時我們拼息呼吸，漸來，漸近，意外地讓過我們向前走去。不錯，這確是「刀」，掛在兩個「油皮」的「碼頭人」的腰間。他們一面　低語着丨丨我們極力想聽出他們的話，到底不興丨丨去了。</p>
<p>爲了道這兩個「碼頭人」走在前面的威脅，使我們的脚步弛緩，更加注意背後的動靜，左右翹望着，拭尋去路以及藏身的處所，凖備逃跑。不一會，落在末尾的同伴也追趕到來，相互地用官話的目光觀望，膽怯地低語着。許多人聚集在一塊，畢竟可以做做圍氣，使膽壯一點。縱然我們明明知道，那怕只一個「嚮馬」截住去路，也會束手就縛的。（未完）</p>

<p>吃完點心後，果然腿子有勁了，我用棍子挑着自己的包袱，像一個鄕里人進城似的横衝直撞地走入了溫泉。這是土耳其似的浴塲，利用自然噴出的熱氣沐浴，在日本這呌做「蒸風呂」據說有皮膚病，傷寒，傷風等病的人，一經蒸風呂沐浴就會好的，所以去這兒沐浴的人，四時不絕。我們把東西放下就去洗澡，男女分浴，各有一問浴室，但中間並没有門，這使我非常不願意進去，日本人是莫明其妙的，一方面封建思想特别來的厲害，男女眞有授受不親的樣子，一方面却又女澡堂裏男人可以走進來替女人擦背的。</p>
<p>經過楊女士好幾次的催促，我才毅然地走了進去。浴房很小，只有上海亭子間那麽大，一個水地裏面盛滿了水冷的水，橡皮水管雖有好幾根，可是一滴水也放不出來。</p>
<p>「這怎麽洗呢？只有冷水，阿蘭你趕快去問先生吧，熱水在什麽地方。」</p>
<p>我們正在笑得肚子痛的時候，隔壁一個聲音傳來告訴我們：先進那個洞裏去蒸浴，然後用冷水冲洗。果然我們推開了門就發現一個像墳墓一般的黑洞，裏面盡是熱烘烘的水蒸氣，看不見半點什麽東西，坐在方格的地板上面感到一種生平未經過的舒服，一會兒身上全是水蒸氣了，由溫暖而進到炎熱。洞裏有個一尺大的窗口，然而被水蒸氣燻得等於没有，黑漆漆地，很像躺在墳墓裏一般。由洞裏跑出來，眞像掉在水窖裏那麽冷得發抖，爲了怕害病，又不得不用冷水冲洗。</p>
<p>洗完澡後就吃飯，飯後拍了幾張照，就開始向目的地前進。</p>
<p>「現在吃了飯，想必大家有力了，快一點走吧，下午要回來趕三點鐘開的船！」</p>
<p>秦先生這樣警告我們，然而我們却仍然像一羣出了籠的小鳥似的到處亂飛，看到了好花便摘，看到了好的風景就留連欣賞。</p>
<p>天氣晴和得像六月一般，富士山很清楚地可以看到。起初我們一面走，一面貪看兩旁的風景，還不十分覺得疲倦，後來愈走愈遠，脚步慢慢地遲緩下來，大家爭着問那位響導「還有多遠？」「一到一半呵！」他是那樣地毫不費力地回答我們，而我們一聽到就全身麻木起來。天，要什麽時候才能看見火山呢？</p>
<p>忽然走進了一座古木參天的樹林裏，翠綠的枝葉遮蔽了天空，由樹葉縫裏射進來的陽光像金絲似的飄動着。路很滑，一不小心跌下去，就是幾十丈。我像溜冰似的從山頂上飛跑下去，一個人先發現了廣漠無根的沙漠！</p>
<p>呵！偉大呵，偉大的沙漠！</p>
<p>在我的眼睛初次接觸着這廣漠無邉邊的沙漠折一刹那，的確我感到一種說不出的驚喜，我踏着沙子一步一步地走着，心裏在想：好好地體貼沙漠中的滋味吧，平時談别人的作品或者自己寫文章的時候老是呌着這沙漠似的人生，這沙漠般的生活，究竟沙漠是什麽模樣，沙漠中的生活是怎樣的滋味，恐怕很少有人體念到吧。</p>

<p>是一個嚴寒的雪夜。</p>
<p>五十八歲的大海，在今夜，拉着黃包車，走在夜深的街上。丨丨</p>
<p>大海在一個多鐘頭以前，離開了他的家。他的家，是一個破敗了的矮屋。同住的，還有個比他更老的娘。母子俩住着這屋子，已經好幾年。</p>
<p>娘的年紀，至少有八十歲了。頭髮全白，眼睛花了，耳朶發聾，走路是慢慢的。這龍鍾的老態，十足的表露她晚年的悲哀。但是她的兒子，却和好同樣的蒼老，他們没有希望，單靠着拉車的錢來過生活，過了今天，不知道明天。</p>
<p>他們是常常捱餓的。街上自從有了公共汽車，電車，黃包車的生意，便壞到不成樣。尤其是大海，像他那麽老，只要看他滿頭的白髮，誰都不願僱他車，因爲他走得慢慢，又怕他跌交，或許把車子和人翻倒在河裏，或是避車不敏捷，遭到意外的巨禍。僱車的，都是年靑的車夫；像大海，走幾步，嘴裏便『呼盧，呼盧』地喘氣，脚步的緩慢，簡直牛兒犂着旱田似的。</p>
<p>大海只會拉車，别的事不會幹，而且也没有事，能够讓給他做。照他年齡，眞不是拉車的時候，但不拉車，除掉和老娘沿街乞食，還有第二修路可走嗎？在這年頭，討飯難道是容易嗎？城市裏的呌化子，不知有多多少少，成天餓着肚皮！大海看到這，所以他只有拚着老命，在這極冷的冬天，跑到馬路上去拉車。</p>
<p>屋子裏點着油燈。</p>
<p>大海的娘坐在燈前，吃完了小半碗稀爛的粥湯，肚子還有點饑。看看鑊子裏，只有小半碗，但是大海的娘不再吃，她留着給大海。她想大海今夜要去拉車，肚子總該吃飽些。一個拉車的，單喫這樣稀薄的粥湯，本來已不够飽，如果再少咆，不是更餓得早些嗎？所以當大海問：</p>
<p>『娘，你還餓嗎？』</p>
<p>『不餓，已經飽了。』母親爽直的回答。</p>
<p>『還吃一點吧？』</p>
<p>『不，你喫，你今夜要······要拉車·····』</p>
<p>娘說着，話裏帶着辛酸。大海見她不吃，就一口倒到嘴裏。吃完粥，大海就走出了那個破敗的屋子。</p>
<p>門外是一個極冷的雪夜。</p>
<p>娘在屋裏専等着兒子。半夜過了，但大海總是不回來。等過夜，第二天天亮後，大海的娘踅出門來守望，但是那不幸的消息正吹進好的耳裏，那消息，就是說大海在昨夜拉着車，經過北星橋時，不愼失了足，跌在河裏凍死了······。</p>

<h3 id="c194">物價慘跌之原因 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>在現代經濟組織制度之下物價問題的重要，凡稍具經濟學常識的，都應該知道。因爲物價問題，實在是經濟問題中一個重要問題。物價的影響，是很普遍的。物價的變動，直接關係各個人的利害。我們都知道，一般人的收入是比較固定的；或者說：變動性很小，（並不是不變動）若物價突然上漲，而收入不變，結果等於支出增加。這足以影響靠固定薪工過活的人們的生計問題。反之若物價下跌，而收入不變，結果等於收入增加。這樣看來，物價下跌較物價上漲似乎有利，然而事實上，竟大謬不然，物價下跌之爲害尤甚於物價上漲。物價下跌是經濟衰落的開端。因爲物價下跌，一般企業立見呆滯，貨品不能售得良價，利潤薄徵，一般企業乃從事緊縮。結果失業的痛苦，降臨於大多數人身上。對於個人，對於社會，對於國家都是不利的。所以物價下跌產生的害處，較之物價上漲有過之無不及。所以不論上漲下跌，物價不穩定，對於各方面都是不利的，而以物價下跌爲害尤甚。</p>
<p>不幸這幾年來，我國物價頻連下降。本年數月各地之平均物價，比較民國二十年的平均物價跌落約達四分之一。換句話說，在民國二十年値一百元的貨物，現在祇能賣得七二五元。物價下跌，爲害甚大，而這次物價跌落又很激烈。原因何在，是很値得討論的問題。吾人願就所知，解說於次。</p>
<p>物價因性質不同而分爲批發（或躉售）及另售二種。二者之差異，自字義上可以看出，勿須詳釋。可是，零售物價的變動，永是隨着批發物價而升降。所以本文採用批發物價作討論的根據，面將零售物價從略。</p>
<p>物價，是以銀元爲單位計算的物品價格。每種物品都有牠的價格。各個物價高低不一，升降亦不一致。討論物價的漲落，若對各種物品的價格，逐一研究，眞是不勝其煩，並且經濟上的意義也頗有限。所以研究物價問題，乃就一般物價加以研究而不以每種貨品單獨的價格，作爲研究的對象。</p>
<p>研究物價的工具就是物價指數，物價指數，乃是用一種平均的方法，從各種變動的物價中，　出各個變動的一般趨勢，並以相對的數目表示出來以觀各種物價之平均變遷，這就呌做物價指數，計有國定稅則委員會編製的「上海躉售物價指數」南開大學濟學院編製的「華北批發物價指數」南京實業部編製的「南京批發物價指數」「漢口批發物價指數」靑島批發物價指數」等五種。全國批發物價指戲，至今尙付　如。然上述五種指數所代表的區域，都是我國的主要商業中心。所以他們的變動上，可以看出全國物價變動趨勢的大槪。</p>
<p>試將各地指數分别比較一下：上海躉售物價指數，本年一月至四月之平均指數，落至九六·二；比較上年（民國二十二年）同時期跌落百分之九·六；而比較民國二十一年同時期跌落百分之十八·一。華北批發物價指數，本年一月至五月之平均指數爲九一·○；較諸上年同期跌落进分之十四·○；比較民國二十年跌落百分之二十三。南京批發物價指數，本年一月至三月，平均爲八一比四，比較上年同期跌落百分之十七·一；而較民國二十一年同期跌下百分之十八·四。漢口一月至三月之平均指數比較上年及前年同期各跌下百分之十六·五與百分之二十四·五。靑島之指數呼跌落百分之九·九與百分之十一·七，本年中各月之指數，均逐步下降，依最近之形勢觀之，物價指數變動之趨勢，仍向下游。最近期内，恐難上升</p>
<p>各地物價指數，第種算得一總指數外，並將各種貨品，依性質之殊異另行計算分類指數。計分爲食品，紡織品及其原料，金屬，燃料，建築材料，化學品，雜項等八類。茲將各地分價指數本年各月之平均指數，與上年同期比較之漲落，列如下表。從這個表裏我們可以看出各種物價跌落程度和趨勢。</p>
<p>第一表：各地批發物價指數與上年同期之比較。</p>
<p>食物　紡織品　燃料　金屬　建築材料　化學品　雜項　總指數</p>
<p>上海丨一九·六丨九·三丨一·0丨八·二丨八·八丨七·二丨七·二丨九·六</p>
<p>（丨一0·五）十</p>
<p>華北丨二三·一　丨三·0丨一0·0丨一二·九丨九·九　一0·八丨一四·0</p>
<p>南京丨二一·0丨一一·四丨一一·三丨二0·九丨九·六丨一五·三丨一七·一</p>
<p>漢口丨二四·0丨七·二丨一八·六丨三·八丨一二·八丨一六·五</p>
<p>靑島丨一五·六丨一五·四丨六·一丨五·六丨八·八丨二·四丨九·九</p>
<p>上海爲一月至四月之平均指數；華北爲一月至五月之平均指數；南京，漢口，靑島爲一月至三月之平均指數。上海項下有十者爲其他食物價指數之比較。</p>
<p>從表中我們可以看出各種指數，勿論總指數及分類指數，祇華北物價指數之「雜項」一種，較諸上年同期升漲外，其餘均下跌。並且各地之分類指數，均以食物類，下跌最劇。如漢口之食物指數，本年三月平均，比較上年同期跌落約百分之二十四。華北食物指數，跌落百分之二十一。上海食物指數，跌落百分之十九。靑島食物指數，跌落最微，然亦達百分之十五。上海物價指數分類裏另有「其他食物類指數」一種。這種指數，較諸上年同期所跌較微，計跌落百分之十。其次則爲金屬指數。各地之跌勢亦頗可觀。再者則屬燃料及雜項指數，跌落程度亦不輕。跌勢比較微小者爲紡織品及建築材料，化學品等。</p>
<p>批發物價指數的分類，更有依物品製造之程序或加工程度分類。各地物價指數裏，祗有華北批發物價指數作這樣分類。分類方法係將各種貨品分成「原料品」及「製造品」兩大類。「原料品」再分爲「農產品」「動物產品」「林產品」「礦產品」等。「製造品」又分爲「生產品」及「消費品」現在把本年首五月之平均指數，與上年同期之指數比較列表如下：</p>
<p>第二表：華北批發物價指數按加工程度分類（本年一月至五月平均指數分上年同期之比較）</p>
<p>原料品項</p>
<p>農產品　動物產品　林產品　礦產品　原料品</p>
<p>廿二年八0·二　八五·一　一三三·五　九六·五　八八·七</p>
<p>廿三年六0·二　七九·八　一一二·九　八七·三　七二·八</p>
<p>本年較上年丨二四·九丨六·二丨一五·五丨九·五丨一七·九</p>
<p>製造品項</p>
<p>生產品　消費品　製造品</p>
<p>廿二年一0九·0一二三·四　一一七·四</p>
<p>廿三年九九·三　一0七·0一0三·九</p>
<p>本年較上年丨八·九丨一三·三丨一一·五</p>
<p>根據上表，依加工程度的分類比較之，則以原料品的指數跌最劇。本年一月至五月之平均數僅七二·八，比較上年同期跌下約百分之十八。製造品指數爲本年首五月之平均一○三·九，比較民國十五年基年之指數一○○尙微高，但較諸近一，二年者則仍跌落甚巨　計比上年同期跌落百分之十一·五。更進一步分析則可知，原料品中又以農產品跌落最烈。本年首五月平均僅六○·二，與上年同期相較則有百分之二十五之下跌。林產品次之，跌下百分之十五·五，鑛產品跌下百分之九·五，動物產品跌下百分之六·三。製造品中，消費品指數跌降較鉅，本年較上年同期跌下百分之一三·三，生產品跌下百分之八·九。</p>
<p>試將此次物價普遍下跌的影響略加推測。根據加工程度的分類，原跌品價格跌落較諸製造品爲巨。此對於企業家大有裨益，蓋可以價跌較巨的原料，經過一番製造手續再按跌價較輕的市價售出，足以獲利。所以這次物價跌落，對於製造家有利益。原料品中，農產品跌落最劇，這對於農民最爲不利。蓋信昔連年天災人禍，有田難耕，近幾年來，内戰稍息，農夫得願播種，結果農產豐收，孰料又遭物價之慘跌。農夫辛勤終年，所獲尙不足種籽的原本，何况又有附捐雜稅的勒索。所以此次物價降跌對於農人最爲不利。一般物價下跌，對於一般靠固定收入的消費者，頗有相當的益處，惟對於我國整個社會之經濟發展，則有莫大的障礙。關於物價下跌的害處，已詳述於本文第一段，故不再贅。</p>
<p>物價下跌的經過，程度及影響，旣如上述。請進而論其下跌的原因，關於這點，論者意見殊不一致。本文因爲篇幅所限，勢不能將各個意見一一臚列。造成物價下跌的原因很多，現在祗將吾人認爲重要的三個原因，伸述於後。</p>
<p>第一個造成這次物價慘跌的原因，當爲一般人民購買力的薄弱。連年内戰頻仿，民不聊生，十八年西北大旱，二十年全國水災，九一八事變之後又遇着外患，敵騎横行，民間的經濟衰蔽枯竭，經營企業者，咸有戒心。貨銷不暢，市面蕭條異常，工廠倒閉的，擱淺的，時有所聞。失業的逐漸增多。僥倖未失業的，均屬勉强對付。物價雖賤，但無力購買。商家因貨物無人購買，只得削價賤售，物價因此狂跌不已，遂形成這次的空前慘跌。</p>
<p>第二個原因，可諉之於銀價的上昇。這點可見二方面言之。中國如銀本位國家。銀價上升，即表示貨幣購買力增加。貨幣豐買力與一般物價成正比例。現在貨幣購買力增。所以物價降跌，這是必然的結果。另一種解釋，銀價上升，係站在金位國家立塲而言。爲銀本位國家之我國，應當說金價下跌，比較合理。銀價上升，或說金價下跌的結果，是我國之對外匯率降跌。據南開大學經濟學院所編製的津滬外匯指數（包括天津上海二地之英美法等國匯率）所示，本年一月至五月之平均指數與上年同期比較，各跌百分之二十一，而比較前年同期跌落百分之三十四。外匯匯率下跌，是表示洋貨在外國之金幣價格雖然未稍攀動，而按現在之匯類折算，即可折成較少之銀幣價格。依此較少之價格在中國出售，仍能得回原本。在過去幾年各國的物價因爲經濟普遍的衰落，本已甚低，而吾國物價却仍甚高昂。這是因爲銀價低落成金價高漲使然。現在銀價上漲，金價下跌，所以物價下跌。再以金價下跌　甚劇，我國物價猛跌非常。我國市塲中仍以洋貨居主要地位。金價下跌，致使洋貨價格下跌，洋貨價格下跌，國貨價格京隨之下跌，於是釀成這次</p>
<p>普遍的物價下跌。</p>
<p>第三個原因是由於各國貨物的傾銷。各國因生產過剩，國内不能容納，於是不得不向國外尋找市塲，以爲尾閭。各國彼此競爭甚烈，於是多採傾銷政策。我國向爲各工業先進國的大銷貨塲，所以各國將貨物運來實行傾銷。洋貨價低，國貨亦不得不隨之跌價。不特此也，各國貨品在海外傾銷的結果，又影響我國的出口貿易。例如絲茶是我國的主要出口貨。年來因爲他國在海外傾銷同類貨品的結果，致使國貨的海外銷路不振。海外銷塲被奪，出口量减，價格自燃因之而暴落。所以外貨傾銷，也是這次物價下跌的原因之一。</p>
<p>物價下跌，對於整個社會的影響實大且巨。這也是中國經濟發展上的障碍之一。障碍不除，進步終難。我們將這次物價下跌的經過及其原因略加探討，縷述如上，希望能爲注意，或是研究經濟問題的人們作點參考。</p>

<p>林襟宇講葉達光記</p>
<p>丨丨十二月六日在曁大商學院演講丨丨</p>
<p>各位同學，蒙貴校董院長的邀請，我來講講中國的審計問題。這個問題看來是很小，但如果要講起來也很大。我現在且大槪的講幾句。關於中國的審計問題，可分做職權，組織，方法等幾方面來講。現先講審計的職權，從審計組織的實踐上可以證明出來。</p>
<p>（一）中國審計的職權</p>
<p>講到職權，審計權在中國，宋朝時已經有了規模，不是到民國才創始的。不過在歷史上考據起來也太冗長，現在姑略而不講，就在民國開始講起。在民國元年的時候，就有中央審計處的設立。除中央審計處外，各省也有各省審計處的設立。那時注重事前審計，同時也注意事後審計。那時的事前審計，也莫的確實行過的。後來又把中央審計處改爲審計院。在這裏先要說明白什麽呌做事前審計和事後審計。所謂事前審計，舉例來說，就譬如貴這次請我來演講，僱了一部汔車到我家裏來接我，付了兩塊錢的汽車費。在這兩塊錢没有付出去以前，必先由會計課弄好一張付欵憑單，經主任簽字，院長簽字，呈校長核准，再經審計核簽後才能把這筆欵付出去。又如曁南大學向敎育部領欵，必須經過敎育部知照財政部，由財政部發給支付命令，送到審計部經審計部審查核簽後，然後發回財政部照撥。這樣就是所謂事前審計。至所謂事後審計，也就是如上述一例兩塊錢的付欵，不過在付欵後每一個月或一定期間彙集一齊送去請求審核，係在事實發生以後而已。</p>
<p>中國的審計製度，自從北京政府時代的審計院成立後，對於事前審計就没有了，但對於國債仍行事後審計。直到國民政府在廣東的時候，仍然没有恢復事前審計，到國民政府定都南京後，成立審計院纔恢復事前審計，亦祗核簽財政機關的支付命令而已。民國廿年四月審計院改爲審計部。審計院之改爲審計部，在民國十八年已經决定。那時國民政府監察院組織法公佈出來雖仍没有事前審計之規定，但政府當局已經有了這個意思，覺得事前審計的重要，非把　恢復不可。至如何恢復，當時中央政治會議提出討論過，規定審計部的職權，「核定政府所屬全國各機關支付命令及收入命令」。及後審計部組織法公布，於民國二十年把審計院改爲審計部，職權也擴大了，其權限不止限於支付命令之審核，且及于收入命令之審核，其範圍不止限于財政機關，而且包括政府所屬全國的各種機關。其審核無微不至，如在上面所講兩塊錢汽車費之小，亦須經過事前審計。但是到現在，此權還未完全實行，現時的審計，仍止限於核簽財務機關的支付命令，現在的審計法，仍舊是以前的審計法，新的審計法還没有公布，若新的審計法公布後，那就要實行了。</p>
<p>再次講到事後審計。關於這個問題，美國的怎樣，日本的怎樣，法國的怎樣······不必去講它，只講中國自己的怎樣好了。事後審計在中國由來已久，審計院三個字宋朝時已經有了，這是歷史上的考證，不必詳說。自民國有中央審計處以後，由中央審計處改審計院，出審計院又改審計部，都是側重事後審計。事後審計係由各機關於財務事實發生以後，把單據，計算書弄好後再送到審計機關審核。就是國民政府在廣東的時候，也有這樣事後的審核。至事後審計的内容怎樣，就是審核各機關的「計算」和「决算」。這在國民政府監察院組織法所規定審計部的職權可以看出。國民政府監察院組織法對於審計部的職權規定「審核政府所屬全國各機關之計算及决定」。不過從來都只有審核計算，却没有審核過决算，因爲中國從來没有辦過决算。此處所謂决算，不是一二個部分機關單獨辦理的决算，而是全國綜合的决算，須全國各機關的决算都送來才能辦完整的决算。</p>
<p>審計的職權，除了上面講過的事前審計事後審計兩個外，還有一個呌做「稽察」的權。民國十八年修正監察院組織法對於審計權的規定，就是審計部的職權應包括事前審計，事後審計，且加上一個稽察權。稽察權修正監察院組織法第五條很明顯的規定，稽察政府所屬全國各機關財政上之不法及不忠於職務之行爲」。現在看來，稽察權是關於財政上之監督，範圍很廣。但稽察權不是現在才有的，從前的事前審計，事後審計都包括此權在内，不過没有把它顯著的分開來而已。譬如蓋了一所房子，無論事前審計事後審計，審查時必須查明其是依法建造，那便是稽察權之行使了。稽察權的規定，多賴當時黨國諸公的功勞。十八年修正監察院組織法就確實的規定了。不過審計院改邵仍没有實行，直至去年九月起審計部才有執行稽察權的第三廳設立。</p>
<p>回頭再講這三個權的分法，在民國十入年外國顧問甘末爾氏主張稽察權與事前審計權事後審計權並立，不過我有一個補充意見，稽察權自有牠的獨立地位，審計部在監察院之下，牠的職權分作（一）事前審計，（二）事後審計，（三）稽察。另有一部分人公對這種主張。其實執行稽察權的機關應與審計部完全分開，因爲稽察不特只注意到財務運用的是否經濟，還要注意到牠的効能。稽察與審計分開，則稽察才可達到牠的眞正作用。雍家源先生在他的「中國政府會計論」極端主張。任應鐘先生也贊成我的意見，在會計雜誌上做過文章。蔣明祺先生有一篇文章講「稽察權之演進」，登在中央日報審計専刋上，也主張稽察與審計分開。這是一個好辦法，但是在立法上很難過於嚴格的規定。不過我的意思在目前並汪是一定主張定要把稽察權與審計權絕對的分開，獨立，祇是希望其能够這樣做到而已。實際上，稽察權現在還没有到需要獨立的時候。</p>
<p>審計部組織法所規定的職權是這三種，還有一項與事前審計，事後審計，稽察都有關係的事呌做預算。監察院組織法規定審計部有「監督政府所屬全國各機關預算之執行」的權。我們的事前審計，事後審計，稽察權，目的只須看其是否依據預算。故無論事前番計事後審與稽察，都是監督預算的執行。至於預算執行之如何監督，另有審計法詳細規定。</p>
<p>（二）中國審計的組織</p>
<p>現在講到組織方面。已先知道了這三種職權，然後才可以去研究牠的組織，因爲組織是跟着職權來的，所以我先說牠的職權而後說它的組織。北京政府的審計院，審計官吏分審計官，恊審官，核算官等。至審計院組織下的廳長由審計官兼，科長由審計官或恊審官兼。國民政府在廣東時化，監察院有審計科，後改爲審計司，到定都南京後，民國十七年又設立審計院，分事前審計，事後審計兩廳。後來立法院議定審計部組織法規定每一廳管事前審計，第二廳管事後審計，第三廳管稽察。關於審計人員，前國民政府審計院也是分作審計，恊審，核算，不過把官字取消了。審計官吏是有保障的。在南京審計院時代規定院長副院長也有保障，審計，恊審，都是有何障的。後來改組審計部，稍有變更，部長副部長没有了保障，後來副部長改爲政務常務兩次長也没有保障了。有何障的只規定審計，恊審，稽察。審計的資格，須係大學畢業修經濟法律會計等科，並且曾任簡任以上官職者。恊審的資格也須大學畢業，不過無須官職的限制，只要有幾年相當的經騐就够了。稽察與恊審同等。核算的名稱取消，改爲佐理員。審計部共設審計九人至十二人，恊審十二人至十六人，稽察八人至十人。廳長由部長指定以審計兼任，科長以恊審兼任。在京各機關之審計，稽察職務由部内不兼廳長科長之審計恊審稽察辦理。還有一個特别的組織，呌做審計會議。審計會議由部長次長，審計等若干人組織之，凡遇有重要事項悉交審計會議决定。這個審計會議的作用在把個人的責任减輕，對内對外共同負責，秉公辦事，不賣賬，不畏權貴。司法官因爲要審判公正，所以要有保障，我們審計官也是一樣的道理。所以審計官之要保障，似乎是在呌我們去奉公守法，故這個保障，乃得罪人的保障。必使審計官吏有保障，然後我們才能够使用職權認眞去辦事。司法官判决案件採合議制以示公允，審計會議之存在亦是此意。關於審計部的組織，還有一項便是牠的直轄機關審計處。審計處的組織，分四組，第一組管事前審計，第二組管事後審計，第三組管稽察，第四組管總務。這個處的處長由部中駐外審計兼任，組主任由部中駐外恊審及稽察兼任。現在審計部要設立審計處有湖北，浙江，江蘇，上海等處。不能依區域劃分的機關，則統設審計辦事處。各省審計處與部中各廳權限之劃分，是審計部各廳總括全國各省市的審計處的審計報告，至於審計處是直接執行審計事務的。審計處的組織在中央日報審計専刋我做了一篇文章，一審計處組織之研究」，言之甚詳。</p>
<p>（三）中國審計的方法</p>
<p>關於審計的職權，組織，已講得差不多了，現在再講講審計的方法，分送請審計及就地審計兩種。審計方法當然以查帳爲主，同時又有一個報銷的辦法。這個報銷的辦法，在宋朝時已經有了，明朝清朝行之最盛。報銷的辦法，有牠的優點，也有它的劣點。劣點在不能明瞭財務運用的確實情形，容易作弊。其優點則在於下級小機關用之爲宜。因爲小機的收支數目甚小，報銷辦法則可免去許多零星手續的麻煩。就地審計，其目的在可以收杜防作弊之効。現在因爲時間的關係，不能多講，但最後有一句話要聲明的，我在審計部幾年來的工作，因審計權不能完全的行使，覺到許多困難，但亦祇有更加忍耐，努力去克服這困難。我們要認清，審計部的職權是很關重要的，如果審計機關不能執行職權，則財政無辦法，財政無辦法，則國家也無辦法。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c203">桃色偵探案 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 隨緣子</p>
<p>我没有研究過偵探學，也没有看見過福爾摩斯的偵探案，所以對於偵探的技術方面，絕對没有批評的資格。不過對於日本新發生的一件桃色偵探案、頗覺有趣，因略述其大槪，以供世之研究偵探學者，爲一種參考的資料。</p>
<p>據某報東京通訊，最近日本在東京發覺十八名日本女子，環戀着一個駐東京某國大使館武官海軍中尉脫雪苗克羅，而該中尉卽利用這些女子，爲偵探日本軍情國情的助手，以達其偵探的目的。這種風流而奇異的偵探案，在歷史上尙少有所聞，不得不說是一件有趣味的桃色偵探案，而値得一般人所研究的。</p>
<p>在這十八名女性之中，沈迷愛河而甘供該中尉奔走最力的，便是谷川春子，西崎淺子，長谷川實子，富柏美彌子，八鋤秋子，門無冬子，及葦川貴世子等七八位名姝。谷川現任某高級官吏的夫人，與該中尉認識以後，情好日深，終結不解緣，對於日本軍事書籍的蒐求，盡力最多。西崎淺子，是東京某女學院畢業，曾留學過歐洲，現爲某大學敎授的夫人。自與該中尉見面後，傾心於該中尉潘安之貌，情絲一縷，卽暗地牽連。該中尉卽利用西崎夫人的社會地位，使其蒐集各種情報。長谷川實子，卒業於女子専門學校，曾爲外國人之日本語敎授。這一羣女性多感於該中尉之體貌與金錢，傾心愛戀，而該中尉面面俱到，應付這一羣女性，而暗中行使技能，不能不稱讚他的是一位偵探絕妙高手。因此我得到兩種感想：</p>
<p>（一）我國雖號稱多妻之國，但是一個人有了兩三位小老婆，往往就應付不周，閙得家翻宅亂，醋海興波，而該中尉能周旋於十八位女性之間，能應付裕如，面面俱愜，該中尉不但是一位偵探老手，到也是一位竊玉専家。此案的敗露，雖因作鋤要求中尉的津貼，不遂，斷絕了一切關係，乃到東京憲兵隊報告，遂將此案的眞相，完全暴露，這原是該中尉一時忽略的緣故，殊爲可惜。</p>
<p>（二）日人善用「美人計」著稱的，所以牠們偵探各國的國情和軍情，往往喜用女子爲間諜。現在該中尉乃將計就計，利用日本女子去偵探日本的軍情和國情，初非是人意料所及。尤其是被該中尉所利用的，並不是幾位普通的妇子，或是高級官吏的夫人，或是大學敎授的尊閫，我不能不深深地佩服他的偷香妙手，和偵探技俩呢。</p>

<p>想着芙子的時間是多的，可没有像，當着黃昏降臨那樣，想得起勁而且帶着無限的悵惘！</p>
<p>丨丨芙子，我的心靈的愛神啊！</p>
<p>自家不時打心裏邊悄悄地說着，只是說給自己聽，不敢讓旁人知道，因爲旁人知道了會指笑我的低能哩，爲什麽愛上那樣一個商品化的女人哩。可是我的確是愛着芙子的。可是就當在芙子的面前我從來亦不曾結實地說出：芙子，我是在熱烈地愛着你啊！我的靜默的戀，爲了怕芙子會裝了不懂事似的給我一個失望的回答，這種痛楚我眞不願意去領受。於是寗可讓靜默的戀思靜默地藏在心底，不敎任何人曉得，也不敎芙子曉得，丨丨但是我相信芙子終會有一天自己曉得的。</p>
<p>丨這些日子我亦在同樣無言的戀着你呵！</p>
<p>芙子準有一天芙子會這樣懂事似的說着，我設想，我的無人知的戀必有自然開花的時候的。</p>
<p>而現在我是常常在無端苦閒着，爲了芙子還没有知道我是在戀着她的緣故。現在我差不多每天能够會見她的。雖然蘊在心頭的話卽是說了一夜亦說不完。但是外面我却不想多說一句話。</p>
<p>跳着的時候，在夢似的暗紅的燈光下，芙子的話最叨絮她會疑問着：</p>
<p>丨丨你爲什麽老是一個人來的？</p>
<p>丨丨我是喜歡孤獨的生活的。</p>
<p>芙子聽着這話似乎有點不解，祇是用着她那醞釀着無邊的少女秘密的眼珠溫存地而又親切地釘視着我的臉龐。她麗麗拉拉地問了許多事。我僅是頻頻點着頭，或是隔了很久才吐出一聲。</p>
<p>芙子也許會覺得我很奇怪吧。我爲是什麽老是獨自個來呢，而每次來永遠是跟芙子一人跳，是的，我是喜歡過着孤獨的生活，我更喜歡沉在一種孤獨的不易爲人所知的靜默的戀思中，芙子或許有幾分明白的。便是不明白我亦願意我孤獨的戀思，寂寂地從心坎上長起來，而又寂寂地凋謝下去。</p>
<p>丨丨是不是亦如我的戀着你一樣地戀着我呢！芙子，</p>
<p>有好幾次差點我便說出了，芙子看了我臉上不同的神情，立刻很敏感地問我：</p>
<p>丨丨你好像，要說什麽話，怎麽又不說了：</p>
<p>話已湧到嘴邊，被這一問，不知怎的，反而和着一口涎沬同時嚥了，這樣，我祗是苦抑地瞧着芙子出神，芙子亦不大懂得地侯是輕倩地哭着。</p>
<p>芙子，你總有一個時候看出我的心思吧。然而我的靜默的戀，就這未憂鬰着，啊！</p>
<p>我很清楚芙子對於我已有着一種異樣的特别情感存在，如同自己對於她似的，我想，自以爲有些不當說出的話，不定一在她却是認爲没有什麽不可的。或是正是她欲說而說不出。因爲就在跟别個跳着的時候，芙子的表情和言笑很顯然是兩樣的，自己也細細覺察到。她多經過和旁人跳了一下，等到跟自己跳的時候，她的神態便越懇摯，而一方則流露出一種不安的侷促，好像是說這種事是無法避免似的抱憾。</p>
<p>而我則没曾留意到這。只是照樣珍重地保藏着靜默的孤獨的戀。</p>
<p>終有一天會讓芙子知道啊！我這樣期待着。</p>

<p>（二）賭徒的心</p>
<p>開了門望見在晴暖的冬陽裏邊浮着笑容的妻的歡欣的臉，惴惴的心才安靜了下來。妻是回娘家借錢去的，旣然帶着歡欣的臉，總不是被拒絕了回來？</p>
<p>「有了麽？」</p>
<p>在床上坐下來的妻，手顫抖着很艱難地從口袋裏掏出兩張五元錢的鈔票來。</p>
<p>「只有十元麽？」剛才高興着的心不由又淡漠起來了。</p>
<p>「十元還不够。你不是說只要十五元就可以敷衍過去了麽？他們也只有二十元錢，我那裏好意思多拿呢？」說着，便歇斯底里地笑了起來。你看這不是五元錢的鈔票麽？不是簇新的中央銀行的鈔票麽？」原來妻的歡欣只是好久没</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>有拿到五元錢的鈔票，今天忽然拿到了的歡欣，而不是明天就要緊逼過來的生活得着解决的歡欣。</p>
<p>拿着那兩張中央銀行的鈔票，慚愧，歉仄，和哀愁的情緒在我心裏頭播着，終於，在晚上，對於自己的命運憤慨起來：</p>
<p>「十元錢也是不够應付的，我們索性上回力球塲去賭一下。運氣好，也許可以赢五元錢回來。」</p>
<p>「輸了呢？」</p>
<p>「終輸不了十元錢，如果謹愼一點的話。」</p>
<p>妻揑着那兩張鈔票，靜默了一回，才說道：「好！」</p>
<p>路上老妻是叮囑我仔細用一點理性，我還那麽地作覆着：「怕什麽呢，我們的慾望不是很少麽？不是只有五元錢的慾望麽？」可是在回力球塲裏輸了四元錢以後，我不由面紅起來了，跑去把六元錢全買了三號的獨赢。妻問我買什麽號？我只騙好說買了張三號的位置</p>
<p>公證人吹了笛子，我的心便毫無理由地跳起來：三號一上來便打了四分，拿在手裏的票子全給冷汗濕透了，我的嘴抽搐着對妻說：「你看，我買了三張呢！」</p>
<p>「希望祖宗保佑。」伸出冰冷的手來抓住我的手。</p>
<p>可是三號終於給二號打了下去，我覺得連眉毛也不由自主地抽動着，二號一點不費力地連打了五分，於是我整個身子發着抖，站了起來。</p>
<p>妻望了望我的臉道：「還是早點回去。」</p>
<p>默默地走了出來，走到冷僻的辣斐德路上，給刺骨的北風吹着時，妻終於低聲地哭了起來。</p>

<p>— 米同</p>
<p>今日的明星即是昨日的臨時演員</p>
<p>勸君莫失意努力才是成功的途徑</p>
<p>我們拿鐘向後撥丨丨撥到多少年以前，那裏在紐約一條骯髒的後街上，一家矮房子的後門口，坐着一個衣服襤褸，營養缺乏的女孩子，坐在台階上哭泣。她一面想着挨駡挨打的苦楚，一面猜想着死，到底是什麽滋味。她從小就死了父母，從來没有受過一個人的憐愛，亦想不到世界上再會有憐愛她的人了。她生長到十二歲，她所感覺到的，祇有日夜辛苦，挨餓挨打，受盡欺凌，穿的是人家擲去的衣服。以這樣的一個人，誰會想到從前的羅碧史梯芬斯（RubyStevens），就是現在的巴巴拉史丹薇（BarbaraStanwyck），鼎鼎大名的女明星，千萬影迷們崇拜的偶像呢？</p>
<p>還有一個。在落杉磯一個體育會的膳廳裏，一個年輕侍者正在每一張桌子上，收拾着吃剩的杯碟。其中有一個會員，旨着那個侍者對他的同伴道：「你看，那個墨西哥的孩子，每天學着唱歌和跳舞。他想將來做電影明星哩。你想可笑不可笑？」他們說着，都笑了起來。在那個時候，當然是個極可笑的事丨丨一個執着賤役的孩子，却具有做電影明星的野心。但是，那是，那個時候的雷門薩孟尼哥斯（RamanSamaniegos），就是現在全世界聞名的雷門諾伐羅（RqmanNovarro）。大槪雷門諾伐羅做了一二十年的明星，無論在默片時代，或是在聲片時代，是無須再詳細介紹的了。</p>
<p>以上不過略舉兩個例，來證明我們的老話：『他們可以做得到，難道我就做不到？』當然，你可以做得到的！好萊塢有多少成功的故事，都要歸功於報運之神。幸運之神有功的地方，當然不得不歸功於她。但是，除去了幸運之外，不可遏止的野心，不可阻撓的决心，和逆境奮鬥着，工作着，無間斷的工作，確已聯合了力量，將十個明星中的九個，高高抬到靑雲之上。在臨時演員之中，你可以找到無數的靑年男女，就是將來的瓊克勞馥，克拉克蓋博，挨第康泰，葛雷絲穆亞。現在的瓊克勞馥，克拉克蓋博，挨第康泰，葛雷絲穆亞等等，當然光耀燦爛，不可向邇的，但是在他們開始的時候，他們何嘗比住在他們旁邊小房子裏的託姆，曼麗，狄克，蓓蒂等等光亮到那裏去呢？許多，其實是大部份的明星，他們都是從艱難困苦中起頭，從艱難困苦中經過，然後才有今日驚人的成功。</p>
<p>他們今天成了明星，因爲他們具有勇敢和决斷，不顧一切的阻礙物，永久地向前擠上去，從來不肯退居人後，或者遇了一些挫折就回頭。并且因爲别人安閑享樂的時候，他們還在工作研究。你要着偉人成功史，不如看電影明星們的成功史，較爲切近事實，而使人易於效法也。我們且不論别人。我們先將不久之前亡故的老影后，曼麗特蘭漱來做個榜樣。講到做電影明星的資格，無論什麽人，都比幼小時候的曼麗柯爾白（MaryKoeber她的原名）好得多。她的大半生，是在一個永久的奮鬥之中，而她所得的酬報，就是一個光榮的勝利。她家境的窮苦，使她連小學都不能畢業，但她却能看報，讀書，審閱她所遇見的人的心理，自己成了見解高超的女子，能够和美國歷任的大總統做朋友，和一切的文學家，敎育家，財政家等等談話，而椯測一到她肚子裏的底細。再以形貌而論，她的容貌，是醜陋不堪的。她的體格，是魁梧無比的。這兩個條件，已經使她萬無做明星之份了。但是曼麗却能利用這兩個缺點，努力圖存的奮鬥了，幾十年，居然在晚年之中成功了别具一格，無人可以模倣的喜劇家。多少次，她被幸運遺棄了，她覺得一切都完了，陷於失業的苦海之中了，一錢不名了，並且許多親戚朋友依靠著她，使她不能自拔了。但是她决不承認失敗，是她應得的結局。她屢次地反攻。她屢次地捲土重來。她來到好萊塢的時候，丨丨這個曼慕小艾美貌的影都丨丨她已是旣老且醜的婦人了。但她却成了影台上最偉大的人物，世界上最受人愛戴的女明星。她就是在臨死之前，已經病入膏肓之後，她還繼續奮鬥了兩年，拍成了歷史上不朽的作品。誰說她的成功，是幸運的造化呢？（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c212">評「情天一曲」 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>MysSongForYou丨大上海</p>
<p>記行以前在南京曾經開映過一部「ASongFoaYou」，也是傑克蒲拉主演的。現在這「情天一曲」，和前一部的故事大致相同，同時歌的内容也無甚分别。在這裏除了說明製片商十分重視營業的把握之外，本來可以不提，不過約略的道及以提起觀衆諸君的記憶。而「ASongForYou」在南京大戲院賣座之盛，也是我們不曾忘記的。</p>
<p>就這一影片來說，自然完全是以「金嗓子」的傑克蒲拉的歌喉作爲營業的號召，爲了主角兒而編製劇本，在歐美電影的明星制度之下，已是通常可見的事。同時，另一方面，除了幾支嘹喨的歌曲之外，幾乎是没有東西了，這也是編劇者可以不可顧及的。至於「情天一曲」的非現實性，更是無可諱言。</p>
<p>作爲聲樂家的傑克蒲拉，我們對於他的「春江花月夜」（TellMeToNight）乃是不會忘懷的。在那一影片中。那旖旎的風光，那柔美的音調，整個的都給人們深深的陶醉。在音樂片風行一時的時代，那應當是一部紀念的作品。雖然那也不過是一首幽美的情歌，在内容上也没有重大的價値。</p>
<p>如將「情天一曲」相比較，無疑的「春江花月夜」要優越許多。但在這裏可以說更現休化一些，快的節奏，輕鬆的噱頭，曼妙的歌聲，快樂的歡笑，組織成這一輕快的作品。不管劇情是非現實的表現，不管它不能深刻的刺戟人們的情感，然而它使人們在嘹喨的歌聲之下，嘩然歡笑，到底是充分的做到了的，這對於MauriceElvey導演確是勝任愉快的。</p>
<h3 id="c213">評「風雨之夜」 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>VoiceintheNight丨卡爾登丨</p>
<p>在陳舊庸俗的偵探片與平凡拙笨的武俠戲，閙得烏烟瘴氣的當兒，我們又看到了這張所謂武俠熱情兼有偵探性質的「風雨之夜」。從演出方面看來，這是比較某些偵探與武俠影片略勝一籌的。牠有着在懸崖深　的空中作險惡的搏擊。狂風暴雨，山崩水汹中的爭鬥。以及撕拚等這些緊張，熱烈，危急的塲面。換句話說，牠憑藉着充足的金錢，與攝影的技術！物質條件與科學力量，造成了一些危機與急局，强烈地急促地提起觀衆一些情緒。比之平庸的偵探案件或兒戲似的打出手，多了一點兒刺激。</p>
<p>自然，我們不能因爲牠有了上面所說的一點强烈的刺激，就說這片子是完善的，良好的，若是這些不根據於健全的故事與嚴密的結構，而存在發展的話。那末，作爲「風雨之夜」的主要内容的故事是息樣的呢？</p>
<p>它寫一個年少英俊，才多藝長的談爾在父親的電話公司做事，因爲援救一個工人的生命，妨害公事而停了職。某次比球時，敵隊球員受了傷，他因借打電話去找醫生的偶然機會中，代利通公司修理好了發電機，而且認識了該公司經理的小姐葩佩。可是這公司的經理魯濱正是他父親營業上的勁敵，爲了某山谷地的電話營業専利權，正由一個奸刁律師白登從中帮着他父親破壞對方的劇情就從這兒發展開來了：談爾在愛戀着葩佩的纏綿中，　助魯濱打走了毀壞利通電綫交接處的所謂壞人！受律師這兒作者撇開了他的父親的指使者，又改名換姓地在利通服務起來。後來白登派人綁走葩佩，親自炸毀了利通在懸崖絕　處新造的電機與河岸。談爾却不顧生死地效忠於利通，他在風雨中搶回葩佩，在狂流中堵塞河流，捉拿奸人。劇作者更拿出他的主張，惡人如白登律師者被自己破壞的電桿打死，所謂善類如談爾者和小姐結婚，兩親家各把公司合併，團圓大吉。</p>
<p>這兒在主題與結構上，有不勝枚舉的錯誤。最大的如主角談爾的立塲，和個性的糢糊與虚構。至於身爲經理的魯濱竟會親自趕去交接處的保護綫，而讓暴徒毆打，再由談爾去救，以及爲案件指使人白登律師，旣雇有許多壞人専事破壞，又會自己去炸毀電機與河岸等，簡直太不近實情了。編劇者把這簡單的故事竟處理得有些地方交代不清，導演就跟着銀幕上零亂地，片斷地映出些所謂旋律，系統的畫面。除了險惡的搏鬥，與用强烈的音響效果，和雨淋水激等構成的危急與恐怖外，要算那一段以電話女接綫生的快動作爲中心，複印的那些水災，火警與地震等速度極高的畫面爲最好了。也許是爲了太熱中於所謂刺激的製造吧，連馬上高爾夫球戰與汽車的逃與追等，也過長地濫用着。</p>
<p>演員多很賣力。主角丁麥蓋爲劇本所限，未有過人的成就，只是在許多熱閙緊張的塲面中。熱閙與浮淺地演着而已。</p>

<p>輿論爭相頌讚之巨片「桃李刦」，近日有金城大戲院開映，無日不告滿座。良以該片哀怨動人，觀客在暗中出帕拭淚者，實不乏人，迨劇終燈亮，遍矚觀客中，有眼圈帶紅者。是片係描寫失業漩渦中一對靑年男女之悲痛遭遇，意在抨擊社會制度之不良，故深能博得大衆之同情而賺得不少熱淚也。片爲電通公司出品，表情，聲音，光綫，化裝，無一不佳，即舶來影片想來也不過如此。聞該院以鉅片擁擠，不得已縮短映期，祇映今天。欲觀者千萬不可失此良機。</p>

<p>— 叔敏</p>
<p>莎麗雖然立即辯白，並且說明她的意思，不過要想帮他的忙，但是吉梅於盛怒之餘，那裏還聽得進她的話，他一奔奔到門口，回頭對着莎麗道：「從此以後，你不要想再見我的面了」他說完了就奔出去了。莎麗在吉梅走後，正在自傷命薄的時候，電話鈴響了起來。莎麗趕緊去接電話，以爲是吉梅打來的，或者他悔悟了。但是她接起電話來一聽，她的希望立即消滅了。那打電話來的，原來是史畢爾醫生。這個時候，瓊和蓋斯已經進來，但是莎麗和史畢爾醫生談話的時候，没有知道他們進來。他們祇聽見沙麗對着電話道：「我不去開割了···我决定不去了···謝謝你的好意，醫生。」她說完了，將電話放了下來，滿不在乎的樣子。瓊連忙搶上一步，問着莎麗道；「你怎麽啦？瘋了嗎？」莎麗歎着氣，搖着頭，有氣無力地，將一切的事和他們講了。她講完了，眼睛裏的眼淚，已經要奪眶而出了。她再也忍不住了，她奔到自己的臥房裏。瓊無可奈何似的看着蓋斯。她忽然想到了一個計策。那是從前蓋斯和她說過的。就是賽馬的日子已近，有一匹馬呌「霹靂」的，是匹穩赢第一的馬，但是這季却没有加入比賽。此外還有一匹馬，呌做「等我一等」的，是出名的疲馬，從來没有赢過一次。但是這兩匹馬外表十分相像。倘使他們能墏「霹靂」弄到手，將他略爲裝扮，當做「等我一等」上塲比賽，人家都不買他的票，他們獨押冷門，豈不大發其財嗎？瓊於是就和蓋斯商量定了，以爲事不宜遲，趕快就要去籌備。他們於是就進行起來，不想那個騎師，明明知道他們的計劃，却暗算了他們。他們所弄到的，並不是「霹靂」，而是另外一匹老馬。但是蓋斯不知道，他費了許多手脚，才將那匹老馬裝成了「等我一等」的模樣。他並且將他所有的錢，一齊押在那匹馬身上了。等到賽馬的那天，莎麗，瓊，和蓋斯都到了。莎麗並且抱着她的那條狗。他們急切地看着「等我一等」走在前面。他們以爲一定可以　赢的了。不想在轉彎的時候，那匹馬突然不跟着圈子走，而跳過了籬笆，落荒而走了。他們正在在驚失色之際，莎麗的一令狗，又突然從莎麗的懷裏，跳了下去向前直奔。它一回兒鑽到一堆人裏面去了。蓋斯連忙追上去，祇看見那只狗向着一個人狂吠，並且狠命地咬那個人的脚跟。蓋斯正想向那個人道歉，不想那個人揮起一隻手來想追那狗。蓋斯立即看見他手臂上，刺着花紋，確是一個銀元的樣子。蓋斯心裏明白。他想定了方法，故意和那人爭吵，並且扭住了那人就打。他們於是在人叢中毆打起來。蓋斯的意思，本來是要等巡警來。果然這樣一閙，一個巡警走了過來，將他們二人捉起來了。正犯捉到了之後，當然冰淇淋公司的經理孝勃爾立即將莎麗的四百塊錢還給了她。瓊於是就勸着莎麗仍舊將那筆錢，去醫治她自己的脚。但是這個時候，吉梅已經坐了一隻船，出門航海去了。他所日夜思想的，並不是莎麗，而是怎樣弄了錢去還給她。有一天，她從海外還來了。他想不到一上岸，經理先生和蓋斯等，已經在岸上等他。孝勃爾看見了他，就告訴他破案的喜訊，並且送了他一輛地方經理坐的汽車。蓋斯亦告訴了他，莎麗正在醫院割治她的脚。吉梅聽了，立即坐了那輛新汽車，開到醫院門口。但是他到了門口，却走不進去，因爲莎麗聽見了吉梅回來了，於悲憤之餘，就和史畢爾醫生商量着，不許他進來。後來還是幸虧多情的瓊，設法引他從旁門進了醫院。他俩一見，悲喜交集，餘事亦就盡在不言之中了。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Reorganization of the Yutian Security Force <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reduction of the Old and Weak, Verification and Dismissal</p>
<p>After Reduction, Troops Will Be Transferred to Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Yutian Security Force and the local militia have repeatedly clashed. In order to fundamentally resolve the problem, the War Zone Clearing Committee has reached an agreement with Chief Sun Jizhou to reduce the original 2,500 men to 2,000 men, dismissing 500 old and weak soldiers. Chen Junmo has already conducted a roll call, and the dismissed soldiers have been transported by car to various locations for dispersal. Zhu Shiqin, a member of the committee, came to Beiping to meet with Huang Fu, seeking instructions. After receiving them, he went to Tianjin to arrange everything. Upon completion, he went to Yutian to handle the matter. Once the reorganization of the force is completed, it is decided that they will be transferred to Qinhuangdao. Yutian will be taken over by the War Zone Security Force. As for the illegal local militia in Yutian, after County Magistrate Huang Zhongkai thoroughly resolved the issue, the militia leader Wang Lanting fled without a trace on the 21st with his wife and three children. His property has been sealed by the village head. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Lanting, leader of the militia under Wang Bingxiao in Yutian Ya Hongqiao, is the main culprit in the Yuanzhuang fire. Fearing investigation of past events as Zhu Shiqin arrived to reorganize the local militia, he fled with his family late on the 21st. His wife's younger brother was captured by the security force and sent to the county government for detention to inquire about Wang's whereabouts. The reorganization of the Yutian Security Supplementary Force, except for the special operations unit under Feng Shouchun, which refused to comply, the rest agreed to the reorganization. On the 21st, Chen Junmo, a representative of the Political Reorganization Committee, verified the dismissal of the force. The excess of 500 men were each given a severance pay of ten yuan, and 50 pigs were slaughtered for a feast. They were transported by heavy-duty trucks to various locations along the Great Wall for dispersal. However, by the evening of the 22nd, two to three hundred men had returned one after another, sneaking back into their respective units. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhu Shiqin is mediating the disputes between the militia and the security force in Yutian, planning to reorganize the security force, eliminating undesirable elements, and reducing the number to 2,000. The rest will be given severance pay and those with guns will be compensated and the guns returned to the government. After reorganization, the force will be transferred to Qinhuangdao, and Yutian will be taken over by the newly organized special police force of Hebei Province. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tangjiazhuang, outside the south gate of Yutian County, was completely burned to ashes by bandits a few days ago. Except for a very few residents who escaped and drowned in the river, the rest perished in the fire, a scene of utter tragedy. After days of consideration, the provincial authorities have decided to take effective measures. The security forces of Ji County, Zunhua, Fengrun, and Yutian, bordering the county, have begun preventative measures to prevent the roving bandits from infiltrating. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Yi Wo, the head of the Japanese special service organization, went to Beiping at noon on the 23rd to negotiate with our authorities on unresolved matters in the war zone. He is scheduled to return to Yu within a week. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yi Wo went to Tianjin with Chaisan a few days ago and completed his business. He arrived in Beiping at 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd and is expected to confer with our side again to resolve all unresolved issues in the war zone. It is reported that Yin Tong, Zhu Shiqin, Yin Rugeng, Tao Shangming, and others will return to Beiping successively on the 24th or 25th to discuss various issues, which may be resolved before the end of the year. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yi Wo went from Beiping to Tianjin earlier. Because war zone issues still need to be discussed with the War Zone Clearing Committee, Yi Wo came to Beiping tonight. Chaisan and many members of the Japanese Embassy welcomed him at the station. It is reported that among the war zone issues to be resolved are: (1) the takeover of Malanyu; (2) the takeover of the war zone by the security force. These two issues can be completely resolved by mid-January at the latest. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yi Wo, head of the Japanese Shanhaiguan special service organization, passed through Tianjin on the express train to Beiping at 2:00 p.m. today. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Chatzhuang Village in Lingshou County, Hebei Province, was surrounded by a bandit gang of 160-170 men led by Yang Hou on the 20th, and was burned and looted. A team of the Lingshou County Defense Regiment rushed to fight back, but was outnumbered and suffered heavy casualties as they were shot along the way. Many hooligans joined the bandit gang. County Magistrate Geng of Lingshou personally led the militia to the border of Pingshan to assist in the suppression. The bandit gang infiltrated from Tang County on the 15th of this month, attacked the Public Security Bureau, seized dozens of rifles, kidnapped dozens of wealthy merchants, and then fled to Fuping County, burning and looting Wangkuaizhen. Later, due to the pursuit of the militia, they fled to Lingshou. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Over a hundred mounted bandits led by Yang Hou Xiaozi raided Fuping County, Hebei Province, on the 21st, burning and looting more than ten villages in the Second District, and kidnapping dozens of men and women. Because the militia of Pingshan, Lingshou, Fuping, and Quyang counties gathered in force, the bandits fled into Tianzikou in the Third District, relying on the mountainous terrain to resist. The militia of various counties have now surrounded the area, blocking their escape route, and suppression is expected soon. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yi Peiji Flees Through the Customs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Heng arrived in Beiping this morning. According to him, the artifacts will be transported to Beijing for preservation, and the central government has allocated 600,000 yuan to build a storage facility in the Chaotian Palace in Beijing. Once the construction is completed, the artifacts stored in Shanghai will be moved to Beijing for preservation. The Sino-British Arts Exhibition will be held in London in November of the coming year, and our country has decided to transport the artifacts from the Palace Museum stored in Shanghai to the UK for display. The central government issued an arrest warrant for Xiao Xiangpei, a fugitive in the Palace Museum treasure theft case. Because the packing of the artifacts was handled by one person, he was arrested to investigate the details of the smuggling of the artifacts. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yi Peiji, the thief of the treasures, could not live in peace in Tianjin. On the 22nd, someone saw him accompanied by two Japanese men boarding the Ping-Shenyang express train eastward through the customs. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the Palace Museum treasure theft case was reported, Yi Peiji has been hiding in Tianjin under the protection of a certain powerful force. According to a telephone call from Tangshan on the morning of the 23rd, Yi, due to the central government's strict pursuit, boarded the Ping-Shenyang train at 2:00 p.m. on the 22nd and passed through Tangshan Customs, accompanied by several Japanese men providing protection.

<p>(Hong Kong) Xiang Hanping is scheduled to come to the province after the New Year. Yu Hanmou arrived in Dayu on the 23rd. Chiang replied yesterday to Chen Libai, commending him for requesting to pursue and suppress the Red bandits. Li Zongren has decided to stay in Guangdong for the New Year and will not return to Guangxi for the time being. Zhang Renmin visited Bai and discussed the pursuit and suppression of the Red bandits, and then returned to Guangdong to report back. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) According to Pingxiang news, after Chen was ordered to close the Southern Route Headquarters, he established a forward command in Shao for the convenience of commanding the pursuit and suppression of the fleeing bandits, appointing Yu Hanmou as the director. The forward command organization is divided into six sections: staff, adjutant, military affairs, military supplies, military medicine, and transportation. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Provincial news, the newly appointed Deputy Commander of the Second Army, Zhang Da, is scheduled to take office in the province on the 24th. Chen Jitang will personally attend the swearing-in ceremony and give a speech. In addition, Li Zhenqiu, Deputy Commander of the First Army, is also scheduled to take office in Yu on the 24th, with Yu Hanmou presiding over the swearing-in ceremony.

<p>(Guangzhou) Bai Chongxi has decided to establish a re-education center in Guilin to accommodate captured communist bandits, and has ordered the Political Training Department of the Fourth Army to draft specific measures. It is reported that a total of 7,000 communist bandits have been captured recently. Except for 5,000 who will be handed over to the Hunan provincial authorities, the remaining 2,000 are all from Guangxi, so they will be sent to the re-education center in the hope that they will repent and reform. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Provincial news, Li Zhenliang, commander of the Fifth Division, arrived in the province by car from Xinjie on the 23rd to visit Chen Jitang, report, and attend Zhang Da's inauguration ceremony as Deputy Commander of the Second Army. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The remains of the lower-ranking officers and soldiers are buried in various places such as Mianshan, Huashan, and Qingshan, unattended. According to a detailed report from He Chengjun, the central government plans to order the Hubei Provincial Government to cooperate with the provincial and municipal party headquarters to first investigate the names, origins, official positions, dates of death, and deeds of those buried in the tombs. In the future, following the example of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, a public cemetery for the Wuchang Uprising will be built, and the tombs will be moved and buried together. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Recent Outflow of Silver Is Substantial; We Will Reiterate Our Promise to the US <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Alerting the US Authorities to the Silver Purchase Process</p>
<p>It Is Too Early to Talk About Abandoning the Silver Standard</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Strictly Prevents the Smuggling of Silver Exports</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the United States implemented inflation and greatly purchased silver, our reserves have suddenly decreased, and the social economy has been affected. With regard to relief measures, on the surface, we are strictly preventing smuggling exports. Fundamentally, we have had to negotiate with the United States. Recent telegraphs from Washington indicate that Secretary of State Hull is considering China's letter regarding the silver purchase process, and at the same time, it is reported that Ambassador Johnson to China also has a similar report to the United States. Those in our relations say that we will respond to the last reply from the United States, reiterating its promise, and alerting the country to its intention, not as the foreign press has reported, exchanging gold for silver. It is understood that our country had protested to the United States' absorption of silver in September of this year, and submitted the protest to Ambassador Shi, who forwarded it to the US State Department and presented it to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, stating that the United States' silver policy would hinder the development of China's economic recovery. If it is not tried, it will inevitably force China to abandon the silver standard, and the world's currency will be affected by profound influences. Roosevelt and Hull attached great importance to this and held several meetings at the White House, drafting a reply to our country. Originally, it was planned to be announced simultaneously in Nanjing and Washington, but due to the great importance of the matter, only a written statement was issued by the White House, stating that the United States would consider appropriate silver purchase procedures so as not to hinder China's economic policy. Recently, our country has once again suffered from a substantial outflow of silver, and the recipient is the United States, so we must reiterate the White House's promise regarding the silver purchase process and alert it to its practice, so as to avoid affecting our country's economic system. The outside world said that our country resisted the US silver policy and would abandon the silver standard as the final stage, and the relevant parties said that it seems too early, but it is not impossible.

<p>(Nanjing) The central political area has always been planned by the municipal government. The Executive Yuan believes that the location of the various ministries and commissions in the area has not yet been determined, and a unified planning agency should be organized to plan the location of each part, buildings, and roads. Currently, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Municipal Government are designated to form a committee to be in charge of this matter, and they will contact the National Government Military Commission, the four Yuan, and various provincial and municipal agencies at any time, as well as the various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that smuggling has been rampant in various places recently. Southern China is based in Xiamen and Hong Kong, and Northern China is based in various passes along the Great Wall. A large number of goods are secretly imported, resulting in huge losses in tax revenue and creating unfavorable speculation in the market. In addition to ordering the General Customs to instruct the Customs in various places to send personnel to strictly suppress smuggling, it has also decided to increase the strength of patrol boats in Southern China and the strength of patrol officers in Northern China. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that the smuggled items seized by various customs are mostly from civilian ships, and their carrying capacity has no rules, which conceals calculations. It is now planned to measure all cargo-carrying civilian ships in the country, mark their capacity and deadweight, so as to simplify the calculation procedures when inspecting goods. More than ten articles of measurement regulations have been formulated and transferred to the Ministry of Communications for joint handling. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

The main force of the fleeing bandits fled to Ping'ao, forty miles southwest of Jinping, and the vanguard arrived at Yaoguang, appearing to cross the river. After our army pursued, they suffered heavy losses, with only more than 20,000 remnants, in a state of embarrassment. Liu Jianwen eliminated the remnant bandits on the Hunan-Guizhou border, killing more than 2,000 bandits and capturing 300 guns. There are no more bandits in the Tongxi area, and only more than a thousand remnants of the pseudo-First Army Corps remain in Tianzhu. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">US Responds Calmly to Japan's Abolition of Treaty, Four Key Points <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Concrete Proposals for Coordination with Britain Have Been Submitted</p>
<p>Quietly Proceeding with Strengthening Naval Power</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the various international problems caused by Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the United States government will strive to be cautious. The proposed path to be followed includes the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Every word and deed that could be seen as opposing Japan must be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Before the treaty expires, sincere cooperation with Britain is required in order to jointly resist Japan's demand for equality in strength. Regarding this, the United States is said to have submitted concrete proposals to Britain.</p>
<p>(3) The United States will quietly proceed with its naval construction plan to reach the limits of the treaty, and will conduct a detailed investigation of any unexpected naval events that may occur after the treaty expires. However, in carrying out this matter, it will also avoid fanfare.</p>
<p>(4) The government will continue external discussions with Japan during the congressional session, in the hope of reaching another understanding and enabling Japan to voluntarily abide by the 5:5:3 ratio for limiting armaments. From this plan, it can be seen that the government's naval diplomatic policy aims to prevent Japan from undermining Anglo-American coordination. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to indications here today, the government does not harbor resentment towards Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. Not only that, but President Roosevelt and his close advisors also regret that the London talks failed to establish a new treaty. The government firmly opposes various statements both inside and outside Congress, namely the establishment of new naval aviation bases along the Pacific coast, the active promotion of naval construction plans, and other war preparations. The government's official attitude is entirely peaceful, and even if there is a naval competition, it must wait for others to initiate it. As for Japan's notice of abolition, according to reliable sources, Ambassador Saito will submit it to the State Department on Wednesday or Thursday. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<p>To Prevent Enemy Air Force Attacks</p>
<p>(Washington) With Japan expected to announce the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty next week, discussions on strengthening national defense and armaments in Congress continue to spring up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Congressman McSween has proposed the latest plan, suggesting the construction of indestructible underground aircraft fields near the border with Canada and along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Mr. McSween also solemnly stated that the construction of such airports is not a sign of hostility towards Canada and Mexico, but rather to prevent the enemy from attacking with air forces under the pretext of not being authorized by those countries.

<h3 id="e16">US Army Annual Report Advocates Immediate Strengthening of Strength <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>And the Speed of Napoleonic Action Is Required</p>
<p>(Washington) Army Secretary Dunne presented the Army's annual report to the President today. The report strongly advocated that the US Army immediately increase its strength to complete the number of 14,000 officers and 165,000 soldiers, and suggested the immediate implementation of the aircraft purchase plan so that the Army can have at least 2,320 aircraft within three years. Mr. Dunne also advocated that the motorization and mechanization of the Army must be completed in the shortest possible time. The officer promotion system should also be improved. At present, officer promotions are usually carried out step by step and progressively. This method has long been abandoned by the Navy Department, and few countries practice it. According to the Army Secretary's suggestion, future promotions should be based on outstanding achievements and passing examinations. The Army Secretary's proposal is welcomed by most soldiers, but officers who have served for a long time will oppose it, because these people cannot compete with young and capable people, and they will inevitably have to retire. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Army Chief of Staff MacArthur presented the annual report to Army Secretary Dunn today, and the US Army situation described was rather bleak. Mr. MacArthur said that the 1920 National Defense Act has not been fully implemented, because "Our troops are old and dilapidated and are really not enough to protect the safety of our ideals." The Army should have a strength of 280,000 men, but now there are only 117,750 men. The state army should have 430,000 men, but now there are only 175,000. As for the reserve team, although there is no approved fixed number, in fact there is not a single person. The major powers are very aware of this weakness, and correcting this shortcoming depends entirely on the American people. The United States must have a standing army of 165,000 men, a national defense force of 210,000 men, and at least 120,000 well-trained reservists. Mr. Mai also suggested in his report that the Army improve transportation, because the Army needs the speed of Napoleonic action. (21st National Telegram)</p>

<p>Japanese Representatives Are Studying It</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese government's return instruction was delivered to the Japanese delegation at around 4:00 p.m. on the 22nd, and discussions began immediately. For a time, the atmosphere was quite tense. The discussion continued into the night, and all efforts were focused on studying the return instruction. (22nd Japan Associated Press)</p>
<p>(London) At dusk on the 22nd, the return was received, and the core of its content was the sentence "re-negotiate based on the British proposal." However, key figures in Britain were not in London before the Christmas holiday, and the 25th and 26th were official holidays. The US delegation is expected to depart on the 29th, leaving only the 27th and 28th in reality. Therefore, Representative Yamamoto should exercise the full range of negotiations with Admiral Chatfield of the British Navy at this time. The discussion should progress to a certain extent, and everyone is waiting in anticipation. Yamamoto's consultations with the British Chief of Staff are based on the Japanese government's return instructions, but the outcome is still a question for the future. However, it is felt that the British side does not need to be pessimistic about the future. (22nd Japan Associated Press</p>

<p>And Establish Japan-Manchukuo Economic Committee</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the reform plan for the Manchukuo resident organization established, economic cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo is deemed necessary for development. As such, preparations are underway to establish a Japan-Manchukuo economic treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dispatched Yanai, Third Section Chief of the East Asia Bureau, to Changchun on the 15th to consult with relevant authorities of Japan and Manchukuo. Having completed the groundwork, he will return home to report to Foreign Minister Hirota. Based on the new Japan-Manchukuo economic treaty, a joint Japan-Manchukuo Economic Committee will be established. The Japan-Manchukuo economic treaty is primarily for the common defense of both countries, focusing on economic cooperation to jointly promote development. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to conclude the treaty as soon as possible. At the latest, by the end of the year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will, in cooperation with relevant parties and domestic entities, complete all necessary preparations. It is expected that by next spring, the joint Japan-Manchukuo Economic Committee will be established based on the new treaty, to promote closer economic ties between Japan and Manchukuo. Foreign Ministry authorities intend to simplify the treaty, while granting broad authority to the joint committee responsible for its implementation, allowing it to operate freely and actively. Currently, they are quietly awaiting the return of Chief Yanai before commencing treaty preparation work. (23rd Japan Associated Press)</p>

The Presidential Mansion is receiving gifts and congratulatory messages from countries around the world and various states in the United States. Green pines and cypresses adorn the White House, while ivory-red poinsettias are arranged throughout the halls. Inside the East Room, a large Christmas tree is displayed, fully decorated with ornaments and illuminated by hundreds of colorful electric lights twinkling among the branches, truly embodying the Christmas spirit. Upstairs, another family tree is displayed, but its decorations consist of old-fashioned candles, reflecting the President's preferences. This tree is also adorned with numerous old-fashioned mesh stockings filled with candies and toys, beneath which lie gifts exchanged among family members, to be opened on Christmas morning.

<p>Discovered by Railway Guard</p>
<p>(Harbin) This afternoon, the railway guard on the Chinese Eastern Railway discovered explosives placed under a wooden bridge fifteen miles east of Yimianpo. The apparent intention was to sabotage a Japanese military train. A train carrying Japanese soldiers was scheduled to pass over this bridge twenty minutes after the explosives were discovered. Had the railway guard not discovered them in advance, the Japanese military train would have been destroyed, resulting in numerous casualties. The railway guard removed the explosives and informed the military train to prevent any possible attack en route, but nothing occurred. The bandits likely dispersed upon seeing the railway guard.

<h3 id="e21">Soviet Interior Committee Exiles Zinoviev <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>And Six Other Opposition Members</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the Nikolaev case, in addition to those already under interrogation, the agencies of the Internal Affairs Commission on December 16 arrested fifteen former anti-Soviet elements from Zinoviev's faction, namely Zinoviev, Kamenev, Sharov, Kuklin, Vavilovici, Bakayev, Valdin, Zeirotsky, Gorshin, Bulak, Geltik, Evdokimov, Fedulov, Kostina, and Safarov. The court hearing concerning Fedulov, Safarov, Zinoviev, Valdin, Kamenev, Zeirotsky, and Evdokimov was transferred to a special committee of the Internal Affairs Commission for execution of exile due to insufficient evidence. The remaining individuals are still under investigation. (22nd TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Various newspapers commented on the preliminary results of the Nikolaev case, exposing the hypocrisy, anti-party, and counter-revolutionary nature of Zinoviev's opposition activities over the years. The Pravda newspaper stated that Zinoviev and Kamenev always revealed their true colors as defeated petty bureaucrats whenever the revolution entered a decisive stage. After their failures, they wore masks of submission, confessed their faults, and secretly continued their shameless work harmful to the revolution. They established a secret organization to seduce unstable and corrupt elements within the party and the Communist Youth League.</p>
<p>The Izvestia newspaper stated that Zinoviev's opposition had collapsed, and the essence of all their efforts and activities was to restore the capitalist system. Those who participated in the faction in the past had not truly and completely broken ties with the opposition, and they had now taken the path of assassinating proletarian leaders, essentially becoming a fascist group aimed at undermining the interests of the working masses. The newspaper emphasized that the entire Tsarist government had failed to destroy the Bolshevik Party, and the world's bourgeoisie, relying on its military intervention, terrorist spies, and blockade actions, had failed to destroy the Soviet regime. In the past, saboteurs, rich peasants, minority nationalists, Socialist Revolutionaries, and all anti-party and opposition elements had failed to weaken the Soviet regime through their combined efforts. Therefore, the newspaper said, "The terrorist group composed of the remnants of the former Zinoviev opposition cannot succeed in its work. The outpouring of grief and sympathy at the funeral of Kirov has told others that the Soviet masses demand that the Soviet government treat these assassins without mercy." (22nd TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Recently, Kirov, the Communist Party Secretary and leader of Leningrad, was assassinated by a thug, which is of great significance for the domestic politics of the Soviet Union and cannot be equated with the assassinations of political figures in other countries. Soviet newspapers have published lengthy commentaries on the motives for this political assassination, which can be summarized as follows: (1) The assassination is recognized as a political conspiracy. (2) The arrested individuals involved are all members of the Communist Party, but their theories are incorrect and they are influenced by Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky, and other factions. (3) Their goal is to change the current administrative system through terrorism, starting with seizing leadership of Leningrad, to "conspire to restore the capitalist system." (4) The influence of Zinoviev's faction is limited to a small number of party members and a small number of members of the Communist Youth League. (5) Seeing that it was impossible to shift national politics, they planned to strike at the core of the Communist Party, targeting Kirov, a close friend of Stalin. (6) This attempt to shift direction is expected to fail because, under Stalin's leadership, the Communist Party will expose and gradually eliminate any form of conspiracy originating from abroad or within the country. The success of industrial construction and the victories of foreign policy, such as the establishment of the Franco-Soviet alliance, will render the opposition in the country powerless. (7) All newspapers have demanded the elimination of counter-revolutionary groups within the country and the implementation of party cleansing. The Pravda newspaper, the organ of the Communist Party, was the first to reveal that the conspiracy originated from Zinoviev and Kamenev, stating that the culprits should be sought among them. The conclusion was to advocate "strengthening unity around our party leaders, especially around Stalin, our beloved and unique leader." (22nd Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Japan's Announcement of Treaty Abolition and Japan-U.S. Relations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Heng</p>
<p>Japan's notification of the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty was officially issued by the Japanese government on the 22nd. After Christmas, Ambassador Saito can submit it to the American government. This action by Japan has been rumored for a long time. Anyone who pays attention to international events knows that this is an inevitable result and not surprising. From now on, the naval reduction conference will follow the disarmament conference and become a major stalemate. Because Japan demands naval equality, and Britain and the United States are unwilling to grant it, any talks will be fruitless. Therefore, while Japan also expressed its willingness to continue negotiations when abolishing the treaty, the prospects of success are unpredictable.</p>
<p>Although this step by Japan affects all signatory countries, the most severely impacted is the United States. The U.S. is the lead signatory to the Washington Naval Treaty, and the purpose of this treaty includes limiting Japanese expansion. Therefore, Japan's action this time is tantamount to a decisive expression of its Far East policy towards the United States. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson once said that the U.S. naval policy, in essence, is to support national policy, protect maritime trade, and defend the mainland and its overseas territories. What Mr. Swanson calls the U.S. national policy in the Far East should include everything contained in the Nine-Power Treaty, also known as the Open Door Policy towards China. The so-called territories refer to the Philippine Islands, Guam, etc. But in fact, the Nine-Power Treaty has been torn apart. The Open Door Policy cannot be guaranteed either. And what the U.S. can do is only protest. And American scholars all clearly acknowledge that the U.S. will not be able to maintain the Philippines once it is attacked. Therefore, the U.S.'s actions toward Japan cannot be achieved. It is only a matter of the abolition of the naval treaty that reveals this to begin with. In other words, Japan's abolition of the treaty this time, although it puts the U.S. in a difficult position, in the short term, the U.S. will not be able to deal with it. Today, what the United States is concerned about stems from more than one cause. One is the difficulty of full cooperation between Britain and the United States. Although Britain and the United States are brotherly countries, they recently rejected Japan's demand for naval equality at the naval reduction conference. However, their relationship is limited to not helping Japan to fight the U.S. To ask them to help the U.S. to fight Japan seems unlikely. Second, Japan's naval power has reached the limits permitted by the treaty, while the U.S. navy lags behind. Even if we work hard to carry out Mr. Swanson's expansion bill, it will be necessary to reach the treaty limit at the end of 1939. Therefore, acting alone cannot control Japan. Third, the U.S. naval bases in the Far East, such as the Philippines and Guam, have suspended the expansion of military ports and fortresses due to the Four-Power Treaty. The defensive strength is extremely weak and will be lost when encountering a strong enemy. Therefore, the value of Far East naval bases has been lost. After Japan abolishes the treaty, the U.S. can greatly expand its military ports and build fortresses here, but it will not be accomplished urgently. Fourth, if Japan takes a defensive position, waits for work with ease, supplemented by land fortresses, air force bases, and the supply of all resources from the Asian continent, it will not be difficult to defeat any powerful fleet. There are countless islands between the Japanese Sea and the Chinese Sea, which can be arranged to become bases for air force and submarine activities. Because of these reasons, even if the United States is working hard to prepare, it is still afraid that it will be difficult to deal with Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, judging from the current situation, unless there is a new development in the relationship between Britain and the United States, I am afraid that there will be no way to deal with Japan's announcement of the abolition of the treaty.</p>

<p>To Learn Motherland's Language and Culture</p>
<p>(London) The East End of London is where the overseas Chinese gather. Chinese people have been living in Britain for a long time, and their children, receiving local education, tend to forget their origins. In light of this, overseas Chinese in Britain have specially raised funds to establish a Chinese school on Benafarlt Street in London, specializing in teaching overseas Chinese children their native language and customs, with tuition waived. The Chinese school also includes a Chinese club. The new school building was officially opened today by Chinese Minister to Britain Guo Taiqi, who delivered a speech in Mandarin. Dozens of overseas Chinese children are studying at the school. A few months ago, they could only speak English, but now they can understand Minister Guo's speech in Mandarin. This is truly a cause for celebration in the overseas Chinese community. (22nd Havas)</p>

Among them, exports to the UK increased by 37%, South Africa by 85%, New Zealand by 117%, the Soviet Union by 52%, and Japan by 500%. According to the annual report of Commerce Secretary Roper, he urged the application of proactive methods to restore the original status of U.S. international trade. Roper believed that the best way to achieve this goal was to reduce tariffs and conditionally abolish certain restrictions through reciprocal treaties. As for exports over the past year, they increased by 53% to Asia, 38% to Europe, and 46% to other places. The price index has increased by 15% compared to the morning. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

<p>Minister Guo and British Dignitaries Preparing Everything</p>
<p>Lord Lytton Elected as President of the Exhibition</p>
<p>To Be Held Twice in February and November of Next Year</p>
<p>(London) Next November, an exhibition of Chinese art, porcelain, paintings, ivory, bronzes, lacquerware, and other items will be held at Burlington House in London. This is a groundbreaking initiative for China overseas. The preparation is quite time-consuming, and the necessary organization has now been formed. Lord Lytton, former Chairman of the League of Nations Investigative Commission, has been appointed as President of the Exhibition, with Chinese Minister to Britain Guo Taiqi and Sir William Llewellyn, President of the Royal Academy of Arts, as Vice-Presidents. It has also been decided to form a special committee consisting of Mr. Eumorfopoulos, Lieutenant Colonel Hobbson, and Sir Percival David to assist the Chinese government in selecting exhibits. Mr. Eumorfopoulos once donated his personal collection of valuable world art to the state. Mr. Hobbson is the Deputy General Manager of the Kong Yu Sun Insurance Company. When the treasures are shipped from China to the UK in the future, the British Navy Department has agreed to dispatch warships to escort them along the way. Even the catalog of exhibits is valuable, as it describes the age, origin, and other details of each item in great detail. At the same time, Minister Guo is inquiring as to whether the new Duchess of Kent is willing to officiate at the opening ceremony of the Chinese New Era Painting Exhibition to be held in London in February next year. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain and current Secretary of State for War Lord Hailsham will join the organizing committee to assist in everything. As London will hold two Chinese art exhibitions next year, and two Chinese delegations have recently visited the UK one after another, coupled with the British people's concern about the current situation of Chinese silver, British newspapers have frequently reported on Chinese affairs in great detail. The work of the delegation led by Yu Hongfei in the UK has been completely completed, and they will spend Christmas on the southern coast before departing for the United States on January 2. Xu Tingyao is scheduled to join Minister Guo on the 29th of this month in laying a wreath at the war memorial. As for the current silver situation, the Chinese government has formally denied any intention to depress the currency value, which seems to reassure speculators. However, the U.S. government's will regarding silver remains unpredictable, which continues to be a major factor disrupting the silver market. The Chinese government has recently remitted £96,049 to the UK to repay the Cripps loan. The numbers drawn have greatly strengthened the credit of various Chinese loans. Even the Tianjin-Pukou Railway loan, which is the weakest of the Chinese loans, has risen to 32 today. China has rarely been so favored by the newspapers in Britain as it is today.

<p>Traces Can Be Found</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although the British and French authorities have denied the Paris newspaper report that Britain, France, and Belgium have signed an air force defense agreement, the German political circles still believe that it cannot be ignored. Before the war, these three countries had also considered the military alliance theory to be inaccurate, and recently France and Russia have also formed a military alliance based on the pre-war form. Moreover, the words of British Privy Councillor Baldwin, "Britain's border defense is on the Rhine," are still in our ears. The Anglo-French repeated temptation of the Netherlands to form a tripartite military alliance failed only because of the Netherlands' refusal. The visits of British Lord Privy Seal Eden to Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, as well as the mutual visits of British and French military authorities, do not seem to be without purpose. There is no doubt that such meetings did take place. Britain's denial has not been convincing, as it does not mention the only real obstacle to the Eastern European Locarno Pact. The treaty states that Britain will be the judge in the event of a dispute and prohibits the contracting parties from entering into secret military agreements with any country.

It is generally believed that those industries that are experimenting to find adequate substitutes for foreign raw materials will be at the forefront. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Berlin Correspondence) Due to the sluggishness of Germany's foreign trade and the inability to maintain a balance in international payments, restrictions on the import of foreign goods have had to be implemented. Consequently, Germany's economic situation and its position in the global economy have attracted considerable attention. Comparing the development of Germany's domestic economy with its foreign trade, the latter is currently in a very unfavorable position. Recently, there have been widespread reports that Germany's restrictions on the import of foreign goods are a maneuver for the remittance conference, hoping to achieve better results on debt. Here is the true cause, as far as is known:</p>
<p>Due to the development of its domestic economy, Germany was originally able to purchase large quantities of foreign raw materials in the world market to maintain and continuously improve its domestic economic situation. Moreover, the import of these foreign raw materials is of great importance to Germany itself. If Germany does not absorb the necessary raw materials in the world market, the development of its domestic economy will be in danger of not being maintained. Based on this reason, when observing Germany's foreign trade, it is a mistake to say that Germany's restrictions on the import of foreign goods are solely for the remittance conference.</p>
<p>In reality, Germany is facing a serious situation of a trade deficit and an inability to maintain a balance in international payments. It no longer has the financial resources to purchase as much of the essential and major raw materials for its domestic economy, such as copper, wool, and cotton, in the world market. The total amount of cash and foreign currency currently held by the German National Bank is 200 million gold marks, and the statistics for its foreign trade show that the trade deficit in the spring of this year alone reached 54 million gold marks. This amount of trade deficit cannot be offset by the income from German ocean shipping and international aviation, and there are no other overseas businesses that can serve as a source of foreign currency inflow. This is the real reason for Germany's restrictions on the import of foreign goods. If Germany's situation in international payments were not as bad as it is today, or if the creditor nations could show considerable concessions to Germany, or if the world could purchase large quantities of German goods, allowing its foreign trade to improve slightly and bear the necessary payments, then Germany would naturally be able to appear in the world market as a major buyer. In other words, the prosperity of Germany's domestic economy is a possibility for promoting the development of the world market. Therefore, anyone who hopes for the development of Germany's domestic economy should find a way to remedy the severe imbalance in Germany's international payments or seek to reduce its foreign trade deficit.</p>
<p>Here, there is something worthy of our attention, namely the development of Germany's textile industry. The main reason for its development is purely due to the increase in purchasing power, not government subsidies. In the spring of last year, the German textile industry imported 232,000 tons of foreign raw materials, while the import in the spring of this year was 265,600 tons. Knowing this, it can be seen that before restricting the import of foreign goods, Germany continuously expanded its purchasing power of foreign raw materials for the sake of the prosperity of the world economy. However, this situation could not be sustained because although Germany purchased a great deal in the world market, the export of German goods gradually decreased. The final result was that Germany lost its ability as a buyer in the world market and could not fulfill its obligations to foreign countries. Last year, the amount Germany owed on economic, political, and foreign debts was 1.4 billion gold marks, of which 300 million came from the profits of shipping, railways, etc., 700 million were from previous foreign trade surpluses, and the other 400 million were from gold exports. This year, the amount of debts payable to foreign countries is about 1.1 billion. Because the trade deficit is so large, there is no surplus, and the amount of cash and foreign currency reserves is also very low, resulting in this huge expenditure having no source. Even if the Soviet Union fully delivers to Germany the amount stipulated in its contract, the cash held by Germany is far from enough to repay the main part of its foreign debts. In short, to revive the world economy, two principles should be given priority: (1) increase purchasing power and cultivate the internal economies of various countries; (2) countries should seek economic cooperation and understanding with each other as much as possible. Germany has done its best to implement the first principle, and the second principle still requires the concerted efforts of various countries.</p>

Before the revolution, the area was poor and helpless, with extremely poor harvests and no industry. The people were ignorant. After the revolution, there was great progress in the economic and cultural fields, especially in the last five years. Currently, 67% of farmers have joined collective farms. There are now 27 machine tractor stations and 35 state farms. The number of literate people in 1926 was only 18%, but today it is 92%. In addition to primary and secondary schools, the state also has many workers' universities and technical schools. (TASS, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e71">The Inside Story of Doumer's Cabinet Overthrow <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(Paris Correspondence)</p>
<p>Mainly due to the Impact of Amending the Constitution</p>
<p>Also Lacking Positive Solutions to Economic Problems</p>
<p>In the midst of political upheaval, the Doumer cabinet, supported by the people nationwide and agreed upon by various parties, was thought to be able to transcend political strife and continue to maintain stability. Little did people know that signs of unease emerged in July. Mr. Doumer, in retirement, was invited by the current President Lebrun to take on a difficult task. He, empty-handed, had neither a party organization as background nor political ambitions. However, while in office, he often acted independently, moving forward bravely, even directly appealing to the people without consulting his cabinet members. For example, regarding the issue of amending the constitution, the cabinet members only fully understood after Mr. Doumer publicly broadcast it via radio. This aroused dissatisfaction among colleagues. Six ministers, led by Herriot of the Radical Socialist Party, submitted their resignations, and the majority of seats in the parliament became shaky. Mr. Doumer was also unwilling to continue. However, Mr. Doumer's reputation remained good. Many social groups still expressed goodwill after his resignation.</p>
<p>Originally, the seats occupied by various political parties in France can be divided into three factions after the general election in 1932: the extreme right wing and the moderate faction are considered one system, the Radical Socialist Party and the Republican Socialist Party are considered one system, and the Socialist Party and the Communist Party jointly form an anti-government system. Among the various parties, the Radical Socialist Party is the largest, with more than 150 members in the 610-member parliament. Therefore, a unified national cabinet cannot avoid collapse if it does not receive the support of that party. According to Mr. Doumer's reputation, it was still possible to get rid of the Radical Socialist Party's constraints, strive for a majority of seats in the parliament, or directly appeal to the people before there was a possibility of victory. But this had the suspicion of being illegal, so he preferred to retire and return to his secluded life.</p>
<p>The direct cause of this coup was the amendment of the constitution, that is, the President has the power to dissolve the parliament, with the following conditions attached:</p>
<p>(1) Within one year after the general election, if the President dissolves the parliament, it must be with the consent of the Senate.</p>
<p>(2) After one year from the general election, even without the Senate's approval, the President can order the dissolution of the parliament.</p>
<p>Another aspect is regarding the budget: "Members of the House of Representatives shall not increase expenditure items in the budget request before the revenue is determined. If the budget has not been established by January 1st, the expenditure can be based on the previous year's budget." Therefore, Mr. Doumer had a rift with the parliament. Mr. Doumer wanted to attempt political stability at this time, so the government must prolong its life. However, most French cabinets are short-lived. Any policy (except for major foreign policy guidelines, everything is difficult to implement). From 1917 to the present, in 17 years, there have been 30 changes of cabinets. French politics is always in turmoil. Mr. Doumer wanted to reverse this decline, advocating that the President has the power to dissolve the parliament to put politics on the right track, which is indeed insightful.</p>
<p>However, doesn't the current French constitution stipulate that the President can dissolve the parliament with the consent of the Senate? This is an empty phrase that is not implemented. It was a provision made in 1875 when the Royalist Party occupied a majority of power and during the chaotic period after the Franco-Prussian War. In 1877, the Royalist Party's MacMahon tried to exercise the power of dissolution, but failed. Since then, the French political world has developed a traditional concept that dissolving the parliament is an offense to general elections, so no one has implemented the power of dissolution since then.</p>
<p>Now, it is really difficult to change the long-standing problems and it has become a political tumor. Another reason is also reasonable, saying who can guarantee that no one will abuse the power of dissolution in the future and turn a democratic country into a autocracy? Although it is now possible to believe that Mr. Doumer will not do wrong, it is difficult to insure later. Therefore, the amendment to the constitution could not be passed.</p>
<p>The Doumer cabinet was indeed very popular politically, but he did not propose positive solutions to the economy. At a time when the gold standard was encountering difficulties and the number of unemployed people increased to more than 340,000, many people had a sense of resentment. The new Flandin cabinet was still formed under the banner of a truce between political parties and national unity, and broke the previous precedent. The President did not convene the leaders of various parties to exchange opinions in advance, but directly issued an order to Mr. Flandin. The time from his acceptance of the order to the formation of the cabinet was only ten hours, which is rare in France. As for major policies, there will not be much difference from the previous cabinet. (November 15th in Paris)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Suffering of Northeastern Farmers Reaches the Extreme <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Farmers are not allowed to harvest</p>
<p>Forcible collection of large rents in various counties</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In the Dongbian Road area of Liaoning Province, the righteous army has been extremely active from August to the end of November this year. The Japanese and puppet troops have attacked and suffered heavy losses repeatedly. Moreover, many righteous soldiers disguise themselves and lurk among the people to scout out the situation of the Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese and puppet troops, knowing this, forcibly implement the "collective household law," strictly inspecting the household registration, prohibiting farmers from staying with relatives and friends. Regarding farming, regardless of whether the harvest season has arrived, farmers are not allowed to go to the fields. They are forced to provide labor to repair roads in order to attack the righteous army. All of these things have caused many farmers to suffer and be innocently implicated. Their suffering has reached the extreme, especially in counties such as Tonghua and Ji'an. The Japanese commissioners in various counties, fearing to incite a civil uprising, requested 2 million yuan from the puppet government for the purpose of restoring Dongbian Road and providing relief to rural areas.</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Liu Shaoyi, the head of the puppet tax supervision office of Jilin Province, believes that as the year is coming to an end and the collection period for the puppet Kangde's first year's large rents in various counties has arrived, and that this is a legitimate tax of the puppet country, it should be levied urgently. Therefore, the puppet office has issued an order to various puppet tax bureaus to levy large rents without delay. The various puppet tax bureaus immediately complied with the puppet order and forced farmers, merchants, and civilians to report and pay. However, at this time of industrial and commercial depression, rural economic bankruptcy, and the people's lack of livelihood, they are subjected to the brutal abuse of the puppet organization, and are really trying to put our northeastern compatriots to death.

<h3 id="e73">Shallow Water in the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Vessels Run Aground Repeatedly</p>
<p>Wuhu Issues Notice for Overloading</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: This year's spring and summer were severely dry, and there has been little rain in autumn and winter. The decline in the water level of the Yangtze River is unprecedented in previous years. The Jiangzhou near Digang in the upper reaches of Wuhu has been exposed to the surface. The floating sand from Madang to Xiaogushan has also been exposed. The channel is recently only about ten feet deep, making it difficult for heavily loaded Jiang vessels to pass smoothly. The Xing Shi vessel of the Sanbei Company ran aground three times last week in Longxingzhou downstream of Anqing and Jiujiang. Today, the Songpu vessel going upstream was also trapped in the mud on three sides of the vessel in the Heisha Zhou area in the upper reaches of Wuhu, with a depth of more than five feet. Therefore, with the help of large vessels passing up and down, it remained motionless. Now, because the cargo carried by the vessel is too heavy, Fuping iron barges have been sent by the Wuhu Hongan Company to unload the cargo. After the cargo is unloaded, measures will be taken to tow it out of danger. The Wuhu Customs has now issued a special notice to various Jiang vessel companies, stating that starting from the 24th of this month, all heavily loaded vessels must lighten their cargo through Wuhu to avoid running aground upstream or accidents. As for the freight rate for goods that are overloaded due to shallow water, it will also be negotiated by various vessel companies. If it is charged at one-tenth of the water fare as in previous years, it will be implemented at the beginning of next month. The river courses connecting Wuhu to various counties in the interior are also unable to pass small vessels due to shallow water, such as the Xuancheng Ban, Shubaguan, Nanling Ban, etc., and many have successively suspended operations this week. If the water in Chao Juan is even shallower, the depth around Shikou is only ankle-deep, and many civilian vessels traveling back and forth rely on the strength of oxen to pull them. This is also a strange thing. (21st)</p>

<p>Xu Yuanquan and Others Go to Hankou to Meet Zhang</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of bandits in the border area of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, after being encircled and suppressed by Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Liu Maoen, Pang Bingxun, and other departments, have been largely eliminated. The small groups of less than a thousand people continue to flee west, even if they escape, they are not enough to cause trouble to the local area. However, when the Jiangxi bandits fled west, He Long and Xiao Ke occupied western Hunan and still plotted to harass the border of Hubei. Therefore, the defense of western Hubei is actually more important than eastern Hubei. Zhang Xueliang and He Chengjun went to Beijing a few days ago to attend the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and visited Chairman Chiang several times. Plans have been agreed upon for clearing the remnants of bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and preventing the bandits from the border of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei. After Zhang and He returned to Hankou, Xu Yuanquan, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, and others came to Hankou from their respective defense areas to pay their respects and ask for instructions. On the morning of the 21st, Zhang met with He and Xu at the headquarters to discuss the aftermath of the bandit areas in detail. Special attention was paid to resettling refugees and relieving the victims. There are also careful plans for the defense of the border of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei. Xu is scheduled to fly back to Shashi within a few days to sit in town. Zhang and He will stay a few more days and then go to Beijing again. The authorities have decided to focus all their efforts on the military affairs of suppressing bandits in Sichuan and Hunan. Yichang is strategically located upstream and can be used for control. It is heard that He Chengjun will be stationed there to enable the armies of Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan to communicate. (21st)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Overview of Transportation in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Six Main Trunk Lines All Reach Neighboring Provinces</p>
<p>Most Roads in Provinces and Counties Are Also Completed</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The six main trunk highways of Jiangxi Province all center on Nanchang. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Line has directly reached Changshan, connecting to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road. The Jiangxi-Hunan Line has implemented Jiangxi-Hunan intermodal transport. It only takes seven hours from Nanchang to Changsha. The Jiangxi-Guangdong Line, after reaching Ganzhou, has connected with the Nanshao Road from Ganzhou to Dayu, which can transfer to the southern section of the Yuehan Railway to reach Guangzhou. The Jiangxi-Anhui Line has long reached Jingdezhen, branching to Qimen and Hukou (bordering Susong). The Jiangxi-Hubei Line starts from the Yongxiu Station of the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway and directly reaches Xiushui, connecting to Longmenchang, which borders Pingjiang. The Jiangxi-Fujian Line was opened to traffic the earliest, but the section from Nancheng via Lichuan to Guangze was previously affected by banditry, and it is only now directly connected to Fujian Province. The national highway, such as the Shanghai-Guilin trunk line, has passed through Linchuan, Chongren, Yongfeng, and reached Badu. The Beijing-Guizhou trunk line follows the Jiangxi-Hunan Line and has reached Dongfengjie via Wanzai and Cihua. Most of the branch roads of the provincial national highways and county roads have been completed except for bandit areas. The newly recovered areas are currently using a spirit of strengthening construction to open up roads in poor and remote areas. Therefore, Jiangxi Province, which previously had the least developed transportation and hindered travel, is now accessible in all directions. The Highway Bureau, in order to complete the newly recovered Ruijin, Yu, Hui, Xingguo, Ningdu, Shi, and the highways bordering Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui in accordance with the Executive Headquarters' limited orders, specially sent Section Chief Yang Xuanlv to Beijing to urge the Economic Committee to issue 200,000 yuan in highway subsidies. The result was extremely satisfactory, and the highways in various bandit areas can be completed as scheduled. The current statistics show that the total length of provincial and county roads reaches five to six thousand miles, and more than half of them are paved with cobblestones. There are more than 500 operating vehicles, with an average income of approximately 8,000 to 9,000 yuan per day, and the business is very promising. Due to the relationship between kerosene and national defense economy, the Highway Bureau has built many charcoal-powered vehicles to replace oil. Short distances are mostly traveled by charcoal vehicles. As for the Yupi Road Nan-Yu section, which runs across the province and connects the southeastern transportation, the earthwork has been largely completed since construction began and it can be opened to traffic next year. In addition, the large iron bridge across the Fu River, which commemorates Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's successful suppression of the communists, and the Zhongzheng Bridge, which connects the city with Niuhang and connects the Gan River, are also under construction. The construction cost is more than 500,000 yuan, and after completion, it will also occupy an important position in Jiangxi's transportation. (December 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Rare Treasure, Dust-Repelling Pearl, Has Been Sold <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Pu Tang Shixia Secretly Arrived in Peiping for the Transaction</p>
<p>Sold to an American Merchant for 95,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Pearl Is as Big as a Chicken Egg and Can Repel Dust</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: On the 16th of this month, a fashionable young woman suddenly arrived at the Six Nations Hotel in Dongjiaomin Lane. Her demeanor was extremely noble. She claimed to be Shi Jingzhi and came to Peiping from Shanghai. Accompanying her was a man, about forty years old, who stayed at the German Hotel inside Chongwenmen. It is said that his surname was Zhang. For several days, they frequently interacted with an American antique dealer, Walker Toll. This fashionable young woman did not leave the hotel for four days in Peiping and only exited the hotel when she left Peiping at 3:00 PM on the 19th. Therefore, her behavior was extremely secretive. Later, a Chinese staff member of a foreign bank in Dongjiaomin Lane revealed that this noble young woman was none other than Pu Tang Shixia, the famous Second Lady Pu in Peiping's social circles.</p>
<p>Pu Tang Shixia is the sister-in-law of the puppet Puyi, the wife of Pujie. Three years ago, she abandoned her husband Pujie and privately took away antiques, pearls, and treasures worth more than 3 million yuan from the Prince Regent's Mansion behind Shichahai in Di'anmenwai, and went to Shanghai, declaring her divorce from Pujie and dissolving their marital relationship. Afterwards, her father-in-law, the former Qing Prince Regent Zaiyi, accused Bo Tang Shixia at the Peiping Municipal Public Security Bureau, and listed the names of the lost treasures in the mansion, requesting the military and police authorities to strictly arrest her daughter-in-law and investigate the stolen property. However, it was too late. Pu Tang Shixia had already taken the property and fled to Shanghai, making it impossible to find and arrest her. This matter became an unsolved case. Over the years, no one paid attention to it anymore. It was only known that this Second Lady Pu had changed her name and was living a carefree life in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This time, Pu Tang Shixia suddenly came to Peiping secretly to sell a Qing imperial treasure, a dust-repelling pearl, to the American antique dealer Walker Toll from Shanghai. When Pu Tang Shixia left Peiping with the property from the Prince Regent's Mansion in 1930, she lacked cash, so she pawned this dust-repelling pearl at a foreign bank in Dongjiaomin Lane for 20,000 yuan to use as travel expenses. Now, she negotiated with the American merchant in Shanghai and agreed to sell the pearl for 95,000 yuan. Pu Tang Shixia specially came to Peiping to redeem the pearl from a certain bank and resell it to the foreign merchant. Now, the transaction has been completed, and Pu Tang Shixia has taken the money and returned to Shanghai. As for the Zhang man who accompanied her, his identity is unknown. The American merchant Walker Toll is still in Peiping, staying at the Beijing Hotel, and will probably take this precious pearl elsewhere soon.</p>
<p>It is said that this dust-repelling pearl was the most beloved item of Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty. Cixi loved pearls, and there were two most precious famous pearls in the palace, one was an amber ball, and the other was a dust-repelling pearl, both as big as chicken eggs, crystal clear, and rare in the world. It is said that this dust-repelling pearl can repel dust. When Cixi was alive, she wore it every windy day. After Cixi passed away, this pearl was worn by Rong, the wife of Puyi. In 1924, Feng Yuxiang entered the palace, and Puyi and his wife fled. Rong secretly took out the two pearls and deposited them with her father Zaiyi at the Prince Regent's Mansion. Then, Pu Tang Shixia took them away, pawned them in a foreign bank, and now resold them to an American merchant. This national treasure is now owned by foreigners, which is a pity. As for the amber ball, it was taken to Tianjin by Zaiyi and kept in his residence. This summer, Puyi took it to Changchun. Because Puyi was often sick in Changchun, it is said that wearing this amber ball can ward off evil spirits, so Zaiyi specially sent it to Changchun for Puyi to wear to get rid of illness. As for whether these two precious pearls have the aforementioned effects, it is unknown, but both pearls are as big as chicken eggs and have a dazzling luster, making them rare treasures in the world.

<h3 id="e81">Maintenance of Yungang Grottoes in Datong <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Plan to Build Yungang New Village</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Tourists in the Past Year</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The Yungang stone Buddhas in Datong, built in the Later Wei Dynasty, are the most culturally valuable historical sites and art in our country. In recent years, domestic and foreign archaeological experts and scholars of religious relics have visited one after another throughout the four seasons, and all have praised them. Unfortunately, protection is inadequate, and the trend of theft and sale is intensifying. Chinese and foreign traitors have specialized in transporting Buddha heads as a long-term profession. It has long been heard that unscrupulous poor people often lurk near the grottoes, taking the opportunity to steal the head of a Buddha. The price of an excellent head can reach thousands of yuan. The Shanxi authorities have repeatedly received letters from various academic groups and antiquities preservation societies, urging them to strengthen prevention, with little success. Recently, the Datong Public Security Bureau was specially ordered to send one patrol officer and six police officers to be stationed permanently in Yungang, responsible for protection. The trend of theft and sale has been slightly reduced. Therefore, this year, more people have visited the Datong Buddhist grottoes than in previous years. Various cultural groups and schools above the secondary level, visiting in groups, are the regular patrons of the area throughout the year. The Ping-Sui Railway authorities, in view of this, in order to develop business and utilize the environment, specially added a tourist train once a week in August of this year, and for the convenience of tourists, the railway bureau has taken on the work of meals, foot transportation, and tour guides during the tour. A special train departs from Peiping every Saturday afternoon and arrives in Datong the next morning (Sunday). Passengers immediately hire rickshaws to visit Yungang for a week and return to the station in the afternoon, taking the original train back to Peiping. Those who have official duties and schoolwork will not be delayed and can travel back and forth with ease. It is heard that each time hundreds of people travel by special train, and there are also many sporadic tourists who do not belong to groups. According to statistics, the total number of people who have traveled to Yungang by special trains this year has reached more than 20,000. As a result, the income of the Ping-Sui Railway and the maintenance of various industries in Datong have benefited greatly. Zhao Chengshou, the cavalry commander who is stationed in Datong by the Jin army, has recently been instructed by Chairman Zhuang to pay attention to the protection of this historical site. In addition to sending troops to protect the stone Buddhas, he has also drafted a plan for proper repairs to benefit tourists. In September of this year, He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Military Sub-Committee, and He Jingwu, a member of the Military Sub-Committee, and Shen Chang, the director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, jointly went to Sui. Passing through Datong, they visited Yungang. Zhao Chengshou talked to He about the plans for the construction of Yungang and the renovation of the Buddhist grottoes. He and others generously agreed to donate construction funds to help its completion. Zhao and others also drafted a preliminary plan for the renovation of Yungang. After the donation arrives, construction will begin. The preliminary plan includes: (1) There are nearly one hundred households of residents in Yungang, living in various Buddhist temples. The smoke and fire are pervasive, and livestock roam around foraging for grass, which is harmful to the stone Buddhas. It is decided to build a new Yungang village with more than 500 houses near the grottoes, so that residents can live together to maintain the historical site and facilitate tourists. (2) The grottoes will be surrounded by walls for easy protection and to enhance the view. The above plan will be implemented next spring. Work can begin when the weather warms and the flowers bloom. After this plan is implemented, the second phase of the plan will be carried out. It is expected that the Yungang stone Buddhas will have a new look next year. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Recent Situation of Drought Relief in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Measurement of Various Lakes and Rivers Is Now Gradually Completed</p>
<p>Chishan Town, Wu and Other Lakes and Rivers Have Started Construction One After Another</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: This year's summer drought has caused disasters, and the disaster areas in Jiangsu Province are vast, especially in Liyang, Lishui, Jurong, Jintan, Jiangpu, Liuhe, and other counties. After deliberation by the Provincial Government Committee, 4 million yuan of water conservancy bonds were allocated to handle provincial and county relief. The provincial-run projects include: (1) Reorganizing the Chishan Lake River Basin; (2) Reorganizing the Zhenwu Canal and Danyang Lian Lake; (3) Dredging the Yili-Jindan Canal, requiring a total of 3 million yuan. Another 1 million yuan will be used to subsidize more than 30 drought-stricken counties to handle local dredging of rivers, digging ponds, building dams, and other projects to expand relief. The labor cost for provincial relief is one jiao per cubic meter. The Construction Department has appointed three guiding engineers, Feng Dan, Chen Ziding, and Qiu Yuheng, to serve concurrently as directors of the relief offices in each county, and the county magistrates of the relevant counties have been appointed as deputy directors (the chief of the technical section of Jiangning County serves as deputy director) to be responsible for all matters. Relief offices for Chishan, Zhenwu, and Yili are established in the cities of Mingrong, Danyang, and Liyang. The above-mentioned lakes and rivers have mostly not been measured before. Special survey teams have been organized to conduct actual measurements of the water level and cross-sections of each lake and river. The survey teams were established on October 20 and set off separately to conduct surveys, which have now been gradually completed. The Chishan Lake River relief project is divided into six sections, with a planned length of approximately 85 kilometers, excavating approximately 6 million cubic meters of soil, requiring approximately 30,000 workers. The Zhenwu Canal relief project is divided into eight sections, with a planned length of approximately 87 kilometers for the main canal and 5 kilometers for the branch canal, excavating approximately 7 million cubic meters of soil, and building gates, dams, and culverts, requiring approximately 40,000 workers. The Yili-Jindan relief project is divided into five sections, with a planned length of approximately 169 kilometers, excavating approximately 4 million cubic meters of soil, requiring approximately 30,000 workers. The above three relief projects will excavate approximately 18 million cubic meters of soil in total, accommodating approximately 100,000 disaster workers. Every thirty workers are in a row, led by a row leader who works with them. The row leader receives 5% of the relief money, and the rest is divided equally according to the amount of soil. Every ten rows form a group, led by a group leader, and every three or four groups form a team, led by a team leader to command them. The group leaders and team leaders are selected by the county magistrates from the relevant district and township chiefs, and the relief office provides them with subsidies. The local county government will try its best to arrange accommodation for all workers, and if necessary, they may submit a request to allocate funds to build work sheds. Each relief office was established separately on November 21. The Zhenwu Canal started construction on December 1. The Chishan Lake River is also building dams and diverting water, and the Yili-Jindan Canal is being prepared. As for the relief projects in various counties, such as the Zhijiang River in Jiangpu, which started construction on December 4, and the Zhujiao Bridge and other five rivers in Liyang, and the Wanggongtang Port and other rivers in Nanhui, will all start construction soon. Other counties are also actively preparing.</p>

<p>Provincial Committee Arrives to Investigate Corruption of Grain Clerk</p>
<p>Sun Xianbin, the director of the county government's grain clerk, committed fraud, inflated charges, and embezzled treasury funds, owing tens of thousands of yuan. Previously, more than ten residents of the county, including Zhu Xiaoqin and Chen Fan, jointly filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Provincial Government. After receiving the complaint, the Provincial Government believed that the matter concerned grain funds and needed to be thoroughly investigated. It then appointed Inspector Zhang Chaoliang to come to Liuhe for investigation. After receiving the order, Committee Member Zhang secretly took a boat to Liuhe from Zhenjiang on the 13th of this month and stayed at the Liu Feng Hotel (using the alias He Ruiren). He did not go to the county government for inspection at that time, but investigated everything in advance from all aspects, and his whereabouts were quite secretive.</p>

<p>Mayor's Speech Mayor Wu said in his opening remarks, "Today, eighty-one public organizations of Shanghai are holding a public memorial for Mr. Shi Liangcai. Mr. Shi Liangcai was assassinated on his way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. When this news reached Shanghai, everyone, whether they knew Mr. Shi Liangcai or not, was deeply saddened. Mr. Shi's sudden assassination was a great loss to society. A country and a society cannot be without leaders. Leaders of a country and a society cannot be created overnight; it takes many decades to create a leader who can lead the country and society to do things beneficial to the country and society. Mr. Shi Liangcai was a leader of society. From a young age, he saw the corruption of the Qing government and knew that reform was necessary. He also knew that reform required new knowledge and new learning. Therefore, at that time, he studied new knowledge and new learning and engaged in the cause of reform. Mr. Shi Liangcai's career can be briefly divided into four parts to illustrate. First, he engaged in the educational cause of the reform movement. Second, he engaged in cultural undertakings to enlighten the people. The most powerful and largest public opinion organ in China today, trusted by the masses, is the Shen Bao. The Shen Bao has been run by Mr. Shi for twenty years, and its power has increased day by day. Mr. Shi's contributions to society and the public have grown day by day. Therefore, Mr. Shi devoted himself to Chinese public opinion to enlighten the people. Looking at the Shen Bao's achievements in the past ten years, its influence on the country and society has been significant. Third, Mr. Shi's career, we don't need to talk about other places, let's just talk about Shanghai. Mr. Shi participated in and promoted various undertakings in Shanghai society that were beneficial to the country and society. He not only participated in and promoted them, but also used his wealth to participate in and promote them. Many undertakings in Shanghai society have developed because of his wealth participating in and promoting them. Fourth, during the Shanghai January 28 Incident, Mr. Shi led various local organizations in Shanghai and organized a Shanghai Local Citizens' Maintenance Association to support the government and deal with the January 28 Incident. Although this was a local organization, its nature was very important. Its appeal reached the whole country and overseas Chinese, and patriots from all sides donated goods and supported the war. This kind of organization is the most powerful and effective public organization in Chinese history, a group that can do its best to save the country in a crisis of survival amidst gunfire and bullets.</p>

<p>This is something that will be forever remembered. Especially the leadership of Mr. Shi and the leaders of various circles in Shanghai, we will never forget. Today, eighty-one public organizations are jointly commemorating Mr. Shi, on the one hand, it is a commemoration, it is a memorial service, on the other hand, it is to awaken social comrades, to continue Mr. Shi's legacy, to do their best for social undertakings, especially the various undertakings that Mr. Shi painstakingly built, do not let them decline with Mr. Shi's death, this is the meaning of today's memorial service for Mr. Shi. At the same time, I, on behalf of the presidium, suggest: (1) Initiate the Mr. Shi Memorial Association, jointly organized with Mr. Shi's family, for eternal commemoration; (2) The presidium also plans to express condolences to Mr. Deng Zuxun and Mr. Huang Jincai, who died with Mr. Shi, along with Mr. Shi's family, and this was approved. (Recorded by Bingxun shorthand society)</p>
<p>Reporting on His Life and Deeds Mr. Shen Xinqing, a former friend of Mr. Shi, reported on Mr. Shi's life and deeds, saying, "The various newspapers have already reported in detail about Mr. Shi's life, career, behavior, and morality, so there is no need to elaborate. However, what Mr. Shi did during his lifetime is worth emulating by us, that is, his spirit and thought. Mr. Shi had an enterprising spirit and a thoughtful mind, which is why he was able to create today's career. The things he did were not done casually; if he could do it, he would do it; if he could not do it, he would stop. If the Chinese nation had more of Mr. Shi's spirit and thought, our country would have been at peace long ago. Mr. Shi supported the revolutionary cause during the Republic of China period, and he spared no effort to engage in social undertakings. During the January 28 Incident, he organized a local association to support the government's rear forces. His service to the Republic of China was also of great merit," and so on.</p>
<p>Yu Zuoting's Speech After Mr. Shen Xinqing finished his report, Mr. Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying, "I remember there are a few sentences in the 'Record of Rites and Sacrifices' that say, 'Those who have made great contributions to the people should be sacrificed to; those who have diligently served their duties until death should be sacrificed to; those who have stabilized the country through their labor should be sacrificed to; those who can resist great disasters should be sacrificed to; those who can defend against great troubles should be sacrificed to.' The ancient sacrificial system was originally a way of remembering and honoring people, and it has the same meaning as the memorial service held today, only the form is a little different. Therefore, we apply the meaning of the ancient sacrificial system to the memorial service. We feel that Mr. Shi Liangcai truly did 'diligently serve his duties until death' and 'defend against great troubles for the local area' during his lifetime. In recent times, the memorial services that have been held in various places have all been initiated by relatives and friends, and they are only private emotions. Mr. Shi Liangcai deserves the phrases 'diligently serve his duties until death' and 'defend against great troubles for the local area.' Therefore, our memorial service today is not initiated for the sake of family and friends, but is initiated as citizens. I think everyone present feels the same way. Mr. Shi Liangcai's life's work can be said to have been 'exerting all his strength to the point of exhaustion'. In the Shen Bao, the newspaper is the best tool for social education. Everyone knows the power of the Shen Bao's popularity throughout the country. Therefore, Mr. Shi Liangcai's role in promoting cultural progress in China is invaluable. His lifelong efforts not only fulfilled the ancient saying 'diligently serve his duties until death,' but also earned him the six words 'made great contributions to the people.' As for defending against great troubles for the local area, everyone present knows how hard Mr. Shi and others worked to launch the local association during the January 28 Incident, so there is no need to go into detail. We feel that in recent years, Shanghai has lost two people who died unexpectedly, which is a great loss to society. One is Mr. Xiang Songmao, and the other is Mr. Shi Liangcai. Mr. Xiang was a pioneer in the industrial world. Although his body has been destroyed, the chemical industry that he founded has indeed made some achievements. In the future, some of the chemical raw materials for our factories can be supplied domestically. This is very beneficial to national defense. Therefore, although he is dead, he has left a great legacy to dedicate to the country. Mr. Shi has achieved the same thing. Although his body has left the world, the cultural undertaking and the center of public opinion that he has built have sown great seeds and laid a deep foundation that will never be destroyed. I remember an ancient saying that says, 'If the living can strengthen themselves, then the dead are not dead.' Therefore, we are not only mourning the dead, but we must fulfill the responsibilities of the living and bring out the spirit of hard work to create great undertakings. These are some of Zuoting's thoughts today, and I ask everyone present to correct them."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "Today we are mourning Mr. Shi because Mr. Shi was killed. Let's discuss the issue of death. In general, apart from being in the mother's womb seeking life, after being born, everywhere is seeking death. There is a common saying, 'Death can be heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather.' From these two sentences, three meanings can arise: one is dying from illness, one is being killed by someone, and one is committing suicide. No one can escape these three deaths. The first is death from birth, old age, sickness, and death, which is inevitable in life. The third is seeking death because one is not happy with life, which is the most worthless, because those who commit suicide have not fulfilled their responsibility as human beings. This kind of death is the most immoral. Only the second kind of death is worth discussing. Why would someone be killed by someone? Being killed naturally has a reason for being killed, that is, there is a value in being killed. Who doesn't want to die, but what dies is the body, and the spirit will never die. The expression of the spirit lies in the career, the great career, which expresses the great spirit. Mr. Shi can devote himself to culture and serve society, and can move the love of thousands of people, so there is today's memorial service. Otherwise, many ordinary people die, why isn't there such a memorial service held? If we recognize this point, then, if we want to have achievements in our careers, then life is certainly enjoyable, and there is no regret in death. Although Mr. Shi's body was killed, Mr. Shi's spirit will last forever." (Recorded by Bingxun shorthand society)</p>

<p>The resident popular donation is carried out for the convenience of residents throughout the city to donate. In recent days, the Emergency Relief Popular Donation Association, in order to enable residents throughout the city to have a detailed understanding of the suffering of the disaster victims in various areas, so as to arouse sympathy and enthusiastic donations, has dispatched personnel to promote and solicit donations from door to door. The association has developed employee certificates and distributed them to the dispatched personnel to wear for identification and to prevent impersonation. It is reported that the association has temporarily suspended for one day yesterday because the photos of the dispatched personnel have not been prepared and attached to the certificates. Starting today, it will continue to solicit donations.</p>

<p>The Central Bank Will Set Up an Exchange for Miscellaneous Silver</p>
<p>In the Future, Miscellaneous Silver and Miscellaneous Coins Can Be Requested for Exchange</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association previously reported to the Ministry of Finance last month that due to the implementation of the new export tax rate by the Ministry of Finance, it was difficult to import overseas bar silver, while domestic silver was still being exported, and miscellaneous coins and silver could not be circulated and used, resulting in domestic economic emptiness. The association requested the Ministry of Finance to open the ban on the import of miscellaneous coins and silver to enrich the financial system. China News Agency has learned that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance No. 8369 yesterday, saying, "We are aware of the fact that after the implementation of the silver export tax, it is difficult to import overseas bar silver, and we request that the import of miscellaneous coins and silver be ordered to open to enrich the current bottom. This is for the purpose of replenishing Shanghai's silver reserves. We have found that the Ministry has no ban on the import of silver. If merchants hold this miscellaneous silver, they can transport it to Shanghai and request the Central Mint to mint new coins in accordance with Article 11 of the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations. As for inland miscellaneous coins, holders can also request coinage in accordance with Article 3 of the same article of the aforementioned regulations. If they are common silver coins, they should follow the measures for cracking down on the transportation and circulation of silver coins in this area. As for the exchange of broken silver and silverware, the Ministry has already agreed with the Central Bank to establish a collection and exchange office for miscellaneous silver materials, which will be established in the near future. In the future, miscellaneous silver and jewelry silver can be requested from the Central Bank for collection and exchange. Please be informed of this order."</p>

<p>Then Find a Way to Promote Sales and Redeem Them at Any Time</p>
<p>Issued on New Year's Day to Prevent Them from Flowing into the Market</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the regulations on construction bonds issued by the governments of Hunan and Hubei provinces have been passed by the Legislative Yuan, and both are scheduled to be issued on New Year's Day. It has been decided to first mortgage them to Shanghai banks and find a way to promote sales. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hunan Bonds The total amount of Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds is 10 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. They are scheduled to be issued on January 1, next year. Interest is to be paid twice a year, on June 30 and December 31. They will be repaid in ten years by lottery. The dates are June 15 and December 15 each year. The income from the province's deed tax and business tax is the first guarantee, and the operating income from the roads built by the bonds is the second guarantee. The principal and interest funds will be kept by a fund management committee. The bonds are divided into three types: 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, and 10 yuan. The proceeds will be used to build roads and pay off old debts to banks.</p>
<p>Contacting for Mortgage Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from Shanghai banks yesterday that the Hunan Provincial Government, considering the large amount of the Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds and the difficulty of promoting them all at once, and feeling that it would be very inappropriate to apportion them to the people, decided to contact Shanghai banks for a mortgage. Yu Jichuan, the Director of the Construction Department, came to Shanghai to visit bank leaders such as Zhang Gongquan and asked for their help to realize the mortgage loan. In principle, the banks have agreed. Director Yu then returned to the province to report.</p>
<p>First Mortgage a Part Now the provincial government plans to first mortgage bonds with a face value of about 4 million yuan to the Central Bank and other banks in Shanghai for a cash loan of 2 million yuan. The provincial government has already contacted the Central Bank and other branches in the province first, and then will send personnel to Shanghai to contact the headquarters. After the success, the roads that are important will be built first, and at the same time, they will be sold to the people separately, but they will never be allowed to flow into the market.</p>
<p>Hubei Bonds The total amount of Hubei Provincial Construction Bonds is 6 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. The proceeds will be used to build roads in western and southern Hubei. They are scheduled to be issued on January 1, next year. Interest will be paid twice a year, in June and December. Principal will be repaid by lottery every six months. From the first to the second year, 6% of the total amount will be repaid each year. From the third to the fourth year, 7% of the total amount will be repaid each year. From the fifth to the sixth year, 8% will be repaid each year. From the seventh to the eighth year, 9% will be repaid each year. From the ninth to the twelfth year, 10% will be repaid each year. They will be repaid in twelve years. The income from the province's business tax will be used as the fund, and the central government will subsidize it when it is insufficient. The bonds are divided into four types: 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan.</p>
<p>First Mortgage A Portion Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from Shanghai banks yesterday that the Hubei Provincial Government, considering that the construction of roads in western and southern Hubei is of great importance to transportation and is a matter of urgency, decided to first mortgage a portion of the bonds to Shanghai banks. Jia Shiyi, the Director of the Finance Department, mentioned this when he visited bank leaders in Shanghai last time. Now Zhang Yuejun, the Chairman of Hubei, is still staying in Shanghai to contact bank leaders.</p>
<p>Find a Way to Promote Sales The amount of the mortgage loan and the term of interest are still under negotiation, but it is generally possible to succeed, because the banks are doing their best to support the construction of various provinces, especially the roads and the revitalization of the countryside, which are very important. It is reported that the Hubei Provincial Government plans to promote sales while mortgaging to banks. If people subscribe enthusiastically, they will redeem the mortgaged bonds, but they will never allow them to flow into the market.</p>

<p>Company Bonds Scheduled for Issuance Next Spring</p>
<p>After the Jiangnan Railway Company, a private enterprise, submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways and obtained the right to build a railway from Nanjing to Fujian, it immediately formulated plans and actively proceeded with construction. In addition to extending the original Wuhu-Sunjiabu section as far south as possible to reach Helixi, it simultaneously began building the Nanjing-Wuhu section, aiming for completion of the entire section by the end of March next year. Although the company had increased its capital to three million yuan, due to the considerable length of the railway and the cost of materials and labor, a further two million several hundred thousand yuan were still needed. Therefore, it again requested and received approval from the Ministry of Railways to issue company bonds worth three million yuan. After consulting with banking circles in Shanghai regarding management, it was decided to issue them formally. The company convened a provisional shareholders meeting the day before yesterday to deliberate on this matter. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Current Status of the Project The Jiangnan Railway Company was established in the early summer of last year. The planned railway route was selected to run from Wuhu to Zhapu. Upon the company's establishment, work commenced immediately, starting with the construction of the Wuhu-Sunjiabu section. This spring, the company received approval from the Ministry of Railways to build the trunk line from Nanjing to Fujian. It promptly formulated plans to extend the line as far south as possible to reach Helixi, while simultaneously constructing the Wuhu-Nanjing section. The entire line is approximately 210 kilometers long. Besides the Wuhu-Sunjiabu section, which was completed and opened to traffic on the 25th of last month, the earthwork for the Nanjing-Wuhu section has reached Caishi, accounting for about seven-tenths of the entire project. Simultaneously, the construction of bridges along the entire line is being accelerated. According to the planned schedule, by March next year, construction trains will be able to reach the south gate of Nanjing, and formal operation will commence after a slight delay. Connecting to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will require approval from the Ministry of Railways, as the Ministry has a central station construction plan. Connecting to that station would facilitate transportation. However, that station is still in the planning stage. The Nanjing terminus of this railway is located outside the south gate (Jubao Gate) at Yuhuatai, and negotiations are already underway with the Nanjing municipal government to connect with the city-operated small railway to reach Xiaguan. In the future, connecting to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will involve either of these two routes.</p>
<p>Opening to Traffic and Business The already operational Wuhu-Sunjiabu section, after laying tracks to Zhusigang in February of this year, began trial passenger services alongside the transportation of construction materials in order to generate revenue early. A mixed train ran once daily in each direction. Subsequently, traffic was gradually opened section by section according to the progress of track laying. Formal operations began on July 30th after the opening to Xuanzhou, with two first, second, and third-class passenger trains running daily in each direction. On September 9th, freight transport was added. After November 25th, when traffic reached Sunjiabu, passenger and freight transport gradually became more prosperous, and business revenue increased daily. Revenue for this month, up to the 20th, has reached over 15,700 yuan, averaging a strong 786 yuan per day. It is projected that the total will reach 25,000 yuan by the end of this month. The total monthly business revenue is as follows: February: 1,032.75 yuan; March: 1,761.79 yuan; April: 1,397.69 yuan; May: 1,559.05 yuan; June: 1,965.70 yuan; July: 2,377.92 yuan; August: 7,423.61 yuan; September: 10,471.14 yuan; October: 12,560.70 yuan; November: 14,746.31 yuan; December (up to the 20th): 15,727.63 yuan.</p>
<p>Adding Capital The company's capital was originally set at one million yuan. Later, to expand the railway line, it was decided at the second shareholders' meeting this spring to increase capital by two million yuan, totaling three million yuan including the original amount, all of which has been fully collected. However, the Nanjing-Helixi section is over 210 kilometers long. The estimated construction cost for the Nanjing-Wuhu section, about 100 kilometers long, including the purchase of new locomotives and rolling stock, is approximately four million yuan. The Wuhu-Sunjiabu section, about 80 kilometers long, cost 2.2 million yuan. The Sunjiabu-Helixi section, about 30 kilometers long, requires the least amount of funding, approximately 400,000 yuan, as there is no need to purchase additional locomotives and rolling stock. The total required funding for the entire line is 6.6 million yuan. After deducting the fully collected capital of three million yuan and debts for material purchases of about one million yuan, a further two million several hundred thousand yuan are still needed. Therefore, in accordance with company law regulations, it was decided to issue company bonds worth three million yuan. This was determined at the twelfth board of directors meeting, and a provisional shareholders' meeting was convened the day before yesterday to deliberate on this matter. A request was also submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval, which was granted on the 29th of last month.</p>
<p>Issuing Public Bonds The total amount of the company bonds is three million yuan. The company's assets and liabilities statement and the list of assets as of the end of the 23rd year, totaling six million yuan, will serve as joint collateral for the bonds, establishing a first mortgage and pledge. A list of assets, along with the contract, has been transferred to the bond-managing bank for safekeeping. The company has also requested the National Government Construction Committee to guarantee the bond principal and the Ministry of Railways to guarantee the bond interest, and approval has been granted. The bonds are divided into three thousand shares, each with a face value of one thousand yuan and an annual interest rate of six percent, payable semi-annually. The shareholders' meeting the day before yesterday approved the principle, and there will be no changes to the collateral and interest as these have already been approved by the Ministry of Railways. The issuing discount and the repayment period will be decided by the board of directors. The issuance date is expected to be in early spring next year.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Shanghai County's Land Survey in the Shanghai Area Completed Early <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Work Was Implemented in May of This Year and Completed in Seven Months</p>
<p>The County Land Bureau Will Begin Land Registration Upon Establishment</p>
<p>Since Shanghai County established a land survey bureau in the past two years to conduct a county-wide land survey, the work has been repeatedly interrupted due to financial difficulties and other changes in the county's administrative area, and it has not been possible to complete the task. This year, the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau formulated a general plan for land surveys in various counties throughout the province, placing Shanghai County in the first phase. The land survey began in May and was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year. It has now been completed ahead of schedule. The progress is recorded below:</p>
<p>Implementation of the Land Survey In order to carry out the land survey in Shanghai County, the Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau appointed Chen Zheng to the county in March of this year to prepare. Later, Chen resigned from the provincial bureau due to other assignments, and the provincial bureau appointed Xue Gansheng to the county in mid-May to take over the land survey team. Based on the implementation steps promulgated by the province, the team proceeded with practical work. Observing that Shanghai County is close to the Shanghai city, and land prices are relatively high, which falls into a special situation, the team referred to the explanation of the provincial steps, such as expanding the drafting of a 1/1000 or 1/500 (reduction ratio) in areas with higher urban status, and actively supervised the work in order to complete it within the limited time.</p>
<p>Completion Ahead of Schedule The land survey team established a guide wire group in June of this year, while simultaneously expanding the guide wire personnel to six people. On October 25th, the guide wire survey for the entire county was completed ahead of schedule. The household land survey began in July, and the surveyors were gradually expanded to twenty-six people, divided into three shifts to carry out the household land survey and cadastral survey simultaneously. After five meetings of the County Land Consolidation Committee, two resolutions on the investigation method were passed: (1) For ordinary farmland, the land surveyors measured the entire map based on natural boundaries and field ridges, and then the original surveyors were responsible for leading the measurement, and the owners pointed out the boundaries on the spot. The land survey was conducted with the investigation. With the above process, the process was carried out thoroughly. The household land survey and cadastral survey were also completed successively at the beginning of this month, completing the task one month ahead of schedule according to the deadline.</p>
<p>Land Registration The provincial headquarters considered that the Shanghai County land survey team leader Xue Gansheng was able to lead effectively, and was able to complete the land survey enterprise in a short period of time, righting the root of the problem, and completing the land survey enterprise ahead of schedule. In addition to requesting the provincial bureau to award a certificate of merit, it has already issued a notice of commendation. All the maps are now being processed for calculation and mapping. It will also be completed in the near future. Once the County Land Bureau is formally established, land registration will begin immediately to increase taxation and benefit people's livelihood.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Yan Replied with Agreement</p>
<p>Ma Shaoquan, an executive committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, is from Nanchangmiao Town, Wuxi. The town is located at a vital transportation hub by land and water, and is often the haunt of bandits. Two years ago, police were stationed in the town, and it became peaceful. Recently, the Wuxi County Government planned to transfer the police stationed in the town to other locations. Ma Shaoquan, considering that it was approaching the winter season, sent a letter to Yan Shenyu, the County Magistrate of Wuxi, requesting that the transfer be postponed. Magistrate Yan has replied to Ma Shaoquan, agreeing to postpone the implementation temporarily.</p>

<p>And Dispatching a Large Number of Police Officers to Strictly Apprehend Yi [Peiji] and Others to Bring Them to Justice</p>
<p>The Antiquities Seized in France Can Be Resolved and Returned</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She [New Sound News Agency], since the Palace Museum's antiquities theft and corruption case was discovered, the Control Yuan [Control Yuan] and the Supreme Court have dispatched personnel to Beiping and Shanghai to thoroughly investigate, obtaining a great deal of concrete evidence of stolen antiquities. The Jiangning Court has filed a public prosecution. However, Yi Peiji and others have absconded and have not appeared in court, preventing the court from conducting trials. The Xin Sheng She reporter has investigated the recent situation of this case and recorded it below.</p>
<p>Arrest of Xiao and Liu The court, before apprehending the main culprits in the theft case, in order to better confirm the theft of treasures and those suspected of being involved in the case, decided to arrest former staff members for interrogation of the theft of treasures. Therefore, Xiao Xiangpei was arrested in Shanghai, and Liu Guang'e was arrested in Beiping. Both Xiao and Liu are from Yi's hometown. They both participated in the boxing of antiquities during the southward transport of cultural relics. Therefore, after investigation, the court decided to arrest them.</p>
<p>Strictly Apprehending the Principal Culprits Regarding the principal culprits of the theft, Yi Peiji, Li Zongtong, and the other seven people, it is now reported that Yi has not left the country and is hiding somewhere, relying on external and political forces as temporary protection to prolong his life. It is reported that Li Zongtong has already left the country. The remaining people are hiding separately in various places at home and abroad. The court authorities are investigating very strictly. Several competent prosecutors have been assigned to handle this case. The Supreme Court has dispatched a large number of police officers, separately in Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, to secretly investigate the whereabouts of the fugitives at any time, striving to solve the case in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Negotiating for Return Regarding a portion of the stolen antiques that were transported to France, after being detained by customs in Marseilles, the person handling the transportation of the antiques had already fled Marseilles, and the antiques are still stored in customs. Initially, the French customs intended to confiscate them. Later, after our diplomatic authorities learned that this batch of antiques had been stolen from the country and transported to France, they ordered our embassy in France to negotiate for return. It is said that progress has been made, and it can be resolved and returned soon.</p>
<p>Seizing Property Furthermore, the Xin Sheng She reporter learned that there was a previous request to the government to seal the property of the principal culprits in the various theft cases as a slight form of compensation. The court authorities are temporarily unwilling to express any opinion on this measure. After all the culprits in the theft cases can be apprehended, the guilt will be determined based on legal trials.</p>

<h3 id="e111">After the Closure of Taifeng Company, Shareholders Decide to Seek Re-establishment <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>To Resolve and Repay All Debts</p>
<p>Yesterday, Custody of the Huaming Factory's Assets Was Executed</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, Taifeng Canned Food Co., Ltd., the oldest and largest food company in our country, recently announced its closure and liquidation due to operating losses, financial difficulties, and the impact of being implicated by the Huaming Match Factory. The company's recent investigation revealed outstanding debts of more than 400,000 yuan. Currently, the shareholders believe the company has long held a position in society and have decided to continue operations. They are now working hard to seek re-establishment. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Truth About the Closure: The company was the originator of large-scale machine-made candies and biscuits in our country. Initially, due to the lack of demand for such foods among the Chinese people, business was slow. Over the years, shareholder dividends were issued at a maximum of six percent. In the past decade, as people's lives have gradually become Westernized, the demand for the company's products has increased. In theory, business should have developed. However, the number of competitors increased, and rising stars such as Taikang Company and Guanshengyuan either implemented strict management, reduced costs, and lowered prices, or employed advertising and effective management, leading to thriving businesses. The company adhered to its conservative policies and remained stagnant, unable to compete. Business gradually declined. In the summer of this year, they realized that this could not continue, so they renovated the storefront, added a food and beverage section, and focused on advertising, attempting a final struggle. However, as the social economy became increasingly exhausted, the company's business did not improve, and they had no choice but to close. In addition to poor business, the lack of liquid funds was also a major reason for the closure. Although the company had a capital of 500,000 taels, most of it was spent on real estate and machinery. Furthermore, due to its creditor relationship with the Huaming Xingji Match Factory, it took over the factory in June of the 21st year (of the Republic) and, after two years of operation, suffered significant losses, which was also the company's fatal blow. The company has now entrusted an accountant to manage the accounts and will await a resolution from the extraordinary shareholders' meeting regarding future actions.</p>
<p>Decision to Seek Re-establishment: After the closure, the company's shareholders believed that Taifeng already had an excellent reputation and credit in society and the food industry, and it would be a pity if it went bankrupt. Therefore, they have decided to seek re-establishment. In addition to scheduling an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the fifth of next month to discuss re-establishment methods, they are also working in all directions, clearing debts and reorganizing, with the intention of increasing capital and continuing operations.</p>
<p>Creditors' Meeting: The company has decided to fulfill its debts to all creditors, so they will not be affected. A creditors' meeting has been scheduled for December 31st. Accountants Xu Yongzuo, lawyer Cha Renwei, and lawyer Zhang Zhengxue have been entrusted to notify all creditors. This accountant and this lawyer have been entrusted by the board of directors of Taifeng Canned Food Co., Ltd. to announce the temporary suspension of business, audit the accounts, and await the shareholders' meeting to decide on future actions. This matter has been published in the newspapers. Now, according to the company's board of directors, we are entrusted to convene a creditors' meeting to jointly discuss methods for repaying debts. In addition to sending separate notices, this special announcement is made: all creditors of the company are requested to bring their debt certificates to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Meeting Room at the Shanghai Tianhougong Bridge at 2:00 PM on December 31st to participate in the discussion. This accountant will report on the company's financial situation. This matter is important, so please do not be absent. This notice.</p>
<p>Custody of Huaming: Furthermore, the company's closure was indeed influenced by the closure of the Huaming Match Factory. Yesterday, accountant Xu Yongzuo and lawyers Cha Renwei and Zhang Zhengxue were legally entrusted to take custody of Huaming's mortgaged assets. Xu, Cha, and Zhang also issued the following announcement: According to the board of directors of Taifeng Canned Food Co., Ltd., the mortgage contract signed with Huaming Xingji Match Factory on June 30th of the 21st year of the Republic stipulated that the factory's land, buildings, machinery, and inventory would serve as collateral to guarantee the factory's debt to the company. The contract stipulated that if the company deemed the business to be in danger or the debt to be too large, it had the right to declare the factory closed and sell the collateral to repay the debt. The factory now owes the company a significant amount of debt, which has accumulated over time and cannot be settled. It is necessary to close the factory and sell the collateral according to the contract. The collateral was originally under the management of company personnel. Now, with the consent of the factory, we are entrusting you, the accountant, to represent the announcement of the closure and to temporarily entrust you, the accountant and lawyer, to take custody of the assets for the purpose of sale and repayment. In addition to accepting the entrustment, this special announcement is made as follows:</p>

<p>At around 5:00 PM yesterday, the last bus (City Permit No. 958, driver Huang Zhaoqi) of the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus Company, traveling from Luodian Town to Shanghai Station, was shot at by bandits head-on at the Jiangchang Road intersection north of the Heqiao Bridge in Dachang City. The bullet hit the thick glass window on the front right side of the bus. With a sudden crash, the bullet grazed the driver's face, and the thick glass window was shattered. Driver Huang Zhaoqi immediately stopped the bus. The bandits boarded the bus and began searching and robbing the passengers. Fortunately, there were not many passengers on the bus, and after being searched, they left without finding anything of value. Huang resumed driving, and when he arrived at Dachang Station, he saw security guards and police officers densely deployed at the station. Zhou Jintang, the chief of the public security branch, was also at the station, believing that the incident was the work of local bandits. They boarded the bus and ordered Huang to drive back to the scene of the incident, but the bandits were nowhere to be found. The driver had a narrow escape. After the bus arrived at Shanghai Station, it was discovered that Zhao Xiting, the vice president of the Liuhe Huizhong Hospital, and the former chief of the Dachang Public Security Bureau (now serving as the chief of the first public security branch in Baoshan County) were among the passengers. When the shooting occurred, they witnessed two bandits wearing gray uniforms. It is reported that the county government has also been informed and is currently investigating the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Prisoner Who Escaped from Prison Received a Longer Sentence After Appealing <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Original Sentence of Two Years Was Increased to Two Years and Six Months After the Appeal</p>
<p>Zhang Huicai and Zhao Yunzu, robbers from Ningbo, were sentenced to heavy prison terms by the Second Special District Court and sent to the Second Special District Prison (Route Masnan) to serve their sentences. Unexpectedly, Zhang and others colluded with Liu Agui, a robber in the same cell, to tear their clothes into strips and twist them into ropes. At around 3:00 AM on September 9th of this year, when the prison gate was opened, they agreed to escape. Zhang and Zhao forced Liu to climb the rope and hang it on the wall to pull them up. Unexpectedly, Liu lost his grip halfway up the wall and fell, injuring his head and dying. The guards discovered the incident and detained Zhang and Zhao, transferring them to the Second Special District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. At the same time, the two prisoners also filed a lawsuit against Huang Baochang, the director of the prison guards, for bodily harm. After a trial by the Criminal Court, it was ruled that Zhang Huicai and Zhao Yunzu had attempted to escape and were each sentenced to two years in prison. Huang Baochang was found not guilty. This was reported previously. Zhang and Zhao were not satisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court opened a hearing and concluded the trial. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chief Judge Guo, along with Assessors Sun and Fan, and Prosecutor Zhang, opened the court and ordered Zhang and Liu to be brought to the court. The original verdict was revoked, and Zhang Huicai and Zhao Yunzu were each sentenced to two years and six months in prison for continuous escape attempts. After the verdict was announced, the meaning of the verdict was explained to the two prisoners, and they were ordered to be returned to custody to await review.</p>

<p>Shao Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison</p>
<p>Other Robbers Also Received Separate Sentences</p>
<p>Yang Peisheng, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, along with detectives Huang Yufu and Hu Guangrong, and detective Li Zexing, previously arrested seven robbers, including Shao Xianglin and Chen Zonglai, and seized five pistols and more than fifty bullets. An investigation revealed that between January 30th and the 25th of last month, these individuals had formed a gang and, armed with weapons, robbed Xue Jinquan at No. 15 Qingyuan Lane on Beijing Road, Gong Guochen at No. 1846 Xinzha Road, Cai Yexi at No. 88 Huade Road, Zhang Daode at No. 842 Tangshan Road, and pedestrian Wang Gensheng on Henan Road, stealing property worth more than 11,000 yuan. They also opened fire to resist arrest. Shao also committed the murder of Yongren Ye Chengqing at No. 21 Yuanfang Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan from the Public Works Department filed a public prosecution for attempted robbery, completed robbery, illegal possession of firearms, resisting arrest, and murder. The confessions were clear, awaiting sentencing. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Shao Xianglin to fifteen years in prison, Chen Zonglai to twelve years, Liu Yucai to seven years and four months, Sun Wenbiao to seven years, Zhu A'bao to one year, Ma Laoer to ten months, and Zhang Youcheng to eight months. The number of days detained before the final verdict will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The firearms and ammunition will be confiscated. Zhu and Zhang were involved in robbery and kidnapping cases in the Chinese area and were handed over to Gu Liancheng from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. Liu, Chen, Shao, and Sun were involved in robbery cases in the French Concession and were handed over to Liu Jinrong from the Second Special District Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Abandoning the Appeal Based on Situational Awareness; Crying and Signing the Guarantee <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Owner of a Sundries Shop on Route LaFayette in the French Concession Abducts a Young Woman</p>
<p>Ding Aduo, the seventeen-year-old daughter of Ding Xu, a local woman and owner of a sundries shop at No. 104 Route LaFayette in the French Concession, was slender and possessed some beauty. She worked at the Dali Hosiery Factory nearby. Last year, she was seduced by Cao Xiren, a man from Huizhou. On January 13th of this year, Cao abducted her to his ancestral home in Huizhou and hid her. Unfortunately, the young woman contracted an illness in the summer and died. Her mother later learned of this and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing Cao Xiren of enticement. After a trial, he was found guilty and sentenced to one year and four months in prison. Cao was not satisfied with the initial verdict and filed an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court accepted the appeal, and the day before yesterday, Chief Judge Guo Dezhang, along with Assessors Sun and Fan, and Prosecutor Zhang, specially convened a collegial panel to hear the case. Cao Xiren, the appellant, admitted to enticing and abducting Ding Xu's daughter, but argued that the sentence in the initial trial was too severe. He stated that he had an elderly mother at home who depended on him for support, and if he had to serve his full sentence, his mother would have no one to support her and would inevitably starve to death. Therefore, he appealed, requesting a reduction in his sentence. Ding Xu, the appellee, then recounted the circumstances of her daughter Ding Aduo's abduction. The court then began deliberations. The prosecutor first rose to present his opinion, stating that the appellant Cao Xiren had enticed and abducted Ding Xu's daughter and taken her to his hometown. According to the current criminal law, this behavior should be punishable by imprisonment for more than seven years. The initial trial only sentenced him to one year and four months, which was too lenient and should be increased. Cao Xiren was shocked to hear the prosecutor's statement and immediately declared to the court that he now accepted the initial verdict, did not wish to appeal, and requested permission to withdraw his appeal. Chief Judge Guo instructed Cao that since he did not wish to appeal and requested to withdraw, he must provide a guarantee, but he could not appeal again in the future. Cao obediently agreed, signed the guarantee with tears in his eyes, and was taken away by the police to be returned to custody to await transfer to prison to serve his sentence. After the court adjourned, those who had been observing all said that Cao had been aware of the situation and had acted wisely, otherwise he would have inevitably faced a heavier sentence.</p>

<p>The Female Worker Deceives Her Mother and Herself</p>
<p>The Paramour Is Detained Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Wu Shen's nineteen-year-old daughter, Miaoying, who lives in a bungalow on Linqing Road, is of slight beauty and possesses a slender figure. She worked as a female worker at the Donghua Cotton Mill on Huade Road. Recently, she became romantically involved with Xu Haiyan (age 22) from Funing, and they engaged in illicit affairs, resulting in her being seven months pregnant. At around 6:00 PM on the 7th of this month, the girl did not return after finishing work at the factory. Xu took her to stay at his house on Meizhou Road, acting as husband and wife. After her daughter disappeared, the mother learned that she had been hidden by Xu. On the 11th, she finally found out where they were staying and took her daughter back. Xu asked people to mediate a marriage with the woman, but they could not reach an agreement due to the discrepancy in the dowry. The girl's abdomen was large, causing the mother great anxiety. The mother asked the girl why her abdomen was so swollen, and the girl claimed that she had eaten too much, trying to conceal the truth. On the 20th, she secretly went to Xu's place again to stay. The mother repeatedly asked her to return home, but she would not listen. The day before yesterday, the mother went to report the incident to Detective Li Zhenyuan of the Chinese Patrol and Chinese Police Officer No. 3150. They arrested Xu and the girl and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station, where they were detained separately. The next morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department described the case, stating that the mother claimed that the defendant already had a wife in his hometown and requested an investigation. The defendant confessed that he had been in a relationship with the girl for a year and that her mother had known about it for a long time. The arrest was made because they could not agree on a dowry of 160 yuan. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be returned to custody and scheduled a sentencing date. The girl was taken back by Wu Shen.</p>

<p>And Notifies Them to Offer Preferential Treatment to Department Stores in the City Center When Wholesale Ordering</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers' Association, due to the imminent construction of the South Shanghai National Products Exhibition site, sent a letter to the First Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting them to send police patrols to protect the site and prevent petty theft. It also notified factories to offer special preferential treatment to department stores in the city center when wholesale ordering. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Police Protection: We are writing to inform you that foreign goods are being dumped in our country at an increasing rate. Promoting national products is an urgent task to recover our economic rights and stop the outflow of wealth. Our association has decided to hold the South Shanghai National Products Exhibition to promote domestically produced products, so that the Chinese people can recognize the importance of promoting national products and jointly develop industry to resist imported goods. We have surveyed the vacant land at the entrance of Hengxing Lane on the 16th pier as the exhibition site and will start construction of the site immediately, with the opening scheduled for New Year's Day next year. Because there will be many people and much activity during the exhibition, maintaining order may be difficult. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to your bureau, requesting that you send police officers to patrol the South Shanghai National Products Exhibition site day and night, starting from the day construction begins, to prevent petty theft and ensure safety. We will be grateful for your assistance.</p>
<p>Notification to Offer Preferential Treatment for Wholesale Orders: This is a notification regarding the approval of a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government, which states: We are writing to inform you that the department store in the city center is about to open. The company's purpose is to promote national products in the prosperous city center area. Therefore, we are sending this special letter of introduction, respectfully requesting that you inform all manufacturers to offer special preferential treatment to the company when wholesale ordering. Upon approval, the Shanghai Municipal Government has been planning the city center area, and the overall plan is now in place. All public buildings are being actively constructed, and the city is becoming increasingly prosperous. This is a newly emerging market. The Municipal Government, recognizing that the department store in the city center aims to revitalize the market and promote national products, has sent this letter of introduction. All our members should support this effort as much as possible. If the department store in the city center comes to wholesale order goods, the prices should be exceptionally low to show preferential treatment. This notification is hereby given.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Pig Farm Charges Exit Fee, Slaughter Industry Will Stop Slaughtering and Oppose <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Party and Government Agencies to Strictly Prohibit</p>
<p>The nine pig farms in Nanshi, including Huang Shunxing, Wu Yixing, Wanlong, Jiuda, Xingji, Chen Yuexing, Samsung, Jilin, and Changshun, recently submitted a request to the Social Bureau to charge a fee of two cents per pig for exiting the pen, which has aroused strong opposition from the slaughter industry. After repeated mediation by the Municipal Party Department, no result has been achieved. It is reported that the nine pig farms have decided to implement the collection starting today (the 24th) and will adopt a method of buying tickets to release pigs. The Slaughter Industry Association held its fourteenth regular meeting yesterday afternoon and unanimously resolved to oppose the fee. If necessary, they will temporarily suspend slaughtering. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Held Yesterday: The Shanghai Fresh Pig Slaughter Industry Association believes that the Nanshi nine pig farms are creating a pretext to collect an additional exit fee of two cents per pig, which is actually increasing the burden on the industry. The city's pig farms also include Yangjing and Wusong, both of which do not have this fee. This is clearly a small number of people seeking personal gain. Furthermore, the social economy has been sluggish in recent years, and the slaughter industry has been greatly affected. Logically, there is no obligation to bear this fee, and in fact, there is no ability to pay it. Repeated requests have been made to the authorities to strictly prohibit this fee. It is reported that the nine pig farms have decided to implement the collection starting today. A fourteenth regular meeting was held yesterday afternoon to discuss how to respond. More than 20 executive and supervisory committee members attended, chaired by Xu Jianzhang. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Oppose the collection. If the nine pig farms insist on implementing the collection, a decision will be made to suspend slaughtering. (2) Dispatch Xu Jianzhang and others to petition the Party and government agencies.</p>
<p>Document Submitted to Party and Government: The document states that the Nanshi nine pig farms are creating a pretext to collect an additional exit fee and requests that the Social Bureau be informed to promptly revoke the fee in order to protect business and avoid disputes. The industry previously submitted a request on October 15th to the government and the Social Bureau to strictly prohibit the Nanshi nine pig farms from creating a pretext to collect an additional exit fee of two cents per pig (omitted). The industry has absolutely no obligation to bear this exit fee. If it is implemented, it will inevitably affect business and cause disputes. Therefore, the reasons are respectfully presented to the authorities as follows: (1) In the 11th year of the Republic, the pig farm industry requested the Shanghai County Magistrate's Office to issue a notice to collect the exit fee. At that time, the industry never agreed and always opposed it. However, the pig farms used their power to obstruct the pig industry in many ways. Some members of the industry, under coercion, occasionally gave small bribes to avoid trouble. However, this cannot be used as a precedent. In the 21st year of the Republic, the nine pig farms brought up the old matter again and secretly requested the Social Bureau to approve the collection, adopting a method of buying tickets to release pigs. The pig industry was not notified of the implementation and had no knowledge of it. Until recently, the nine pig farms suddenly set up a place to sell tickets and forcibly collect the fee, which caused disputes. It can be seen that the industry has never recognized the exit fee and there is no precedent for it. (2) The industry's slaughtered pigs are purchased by meat shops from the pig market, which in turn entrusts the industry to extract them from the pig farm. The industry only acts as an agent for slaughter. The industry is not the owner of the goods, and the exit fee should not be borne by the industry. Even if it is necessary to collect the fee, it should be taken from the owner of the goods. Furthermore, the pig market gives the pig farm a fee of 1.8 cents per pig (the pig market collects 9 cents from the meat shops for binding feet, 4 cents from the traders for pen fees, and 5 cents for驳费). How can they create a pretext to collect an additional fee, causing the industry to suffer a great loss? (3) In addition to the nine pig farms in Nanshi, there are more than a dozen pig farms in Yangjing and Wusong. All the pigs are purchased by meat shops, and the pig farms directly send people to the slaughterhouses for slaughter. There has never been any demand, let alone exit fees. In the same urban area, a small number of pig farms in Nanshi hold a different view, increasing the burden on the industry, which is not reasonable. (4) In recent years, the social economy has been sluggish, and the industry has been greatly affected. Logically, there is no obligation to bear this exit fee, and in fact, there is no ability to pay it. Although harsh taxes are harmful to the people, they benefit the state. In recent years, they have been gradually abolished. The exit fee in this case does not benefit the state's finances and only benefits a small number of people. Therefore, there is no reason for it to exist and it is necessary to strictly prohibit it. In summary, the matter concerns the industry's vital interests and it is difficult to remain silent. We respectfully request that the authorities investigate and order the Social Bureau to revoke the Nanshi nine pig farms' pretext for collecting an additional exit fee in order to stabilize business and avoid disputes. This will be a great kindness. We respectfully submit this document.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Temporary Suspension of Cattle Imports, Beef Shortage, Prices Soar <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Beef Stallholders Will Jointly Petition the Health Bureau</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Health Bureau instructed the Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association that foot-and-mouth disease had been found in cattle coming to Shanghai. After discussions with the Veterinary Disease Prevention Institute and the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, it was agreed to temporarily suspend cattle transport to Shanghai for two weeks. As beef is an essential food item, this reporter immediately investigated the actual situation with various beef stallholders. According to the stallholders, there are only about 200 cattle in Shanghai that can be slaughtered, which is not even enough for one day's normal use. Upon hearing this news, some unscrupulous merchants are refusing to slaughter the remaining cattle and are immediately increasing the price of frozen beef stored in icehouses by more than double. For example, the highest market price per pound on December 20th was 9 cents, but yesterday it had increased to 19 cents, and today it has increased to 20 cents. Furthermore, each stallholder has a fixed price for long-term customers and cannot increase the price temporarily. Therefore, they have already suffered significant losses in the past two days. If the Health Bureau prohibits cattle from coming to Shanghai for two weeks, the stallholders will have no beef to sell, and they will have no way to cover their daily expenses. With the New Year approaching, it will be difficult to manage their finances. Therefore, they are all complaining incessantly. It is reported that they will organize a beef stallholders' petition to the Health Bureau, requesting permission for disease-free cattle to come to Shanghai, and informing cattle traders of the cattle disease situation so they can select cattle accordingly. This will prevent the spread of cattle diseases and prevent traders from becoming unemployed. Furthermore, according to cattle traders, due to their ignorance of the Health Bureau's instructions, many cattle were transported to Shanghai from various places a few days ago. However, the Health Bureau will not inspect them and they cannot pass through. They are now being held everywhere and cannot be sent to slaughterhouses or cattle markets for temporary care. The weather is cold and it is difficult to feed them. Even disease-free cattle will develop diseases.</p>

<p>Zhu Jihuang, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, along with detectives Wang Guangqi, Hu Guangrong, Wang Runhe, and detective Li Zexing, learned that Sun Guanjiu (age 34) from Pudong, residing in Room 19 of the Xi'an Hotel at No. 98 Xi'an Road, was selling the raw materials for the drug "red pill." Each unit required 140 yuan of silver dollars. The day before yesterday, they used an informant with marked banknotes to pay Sun, arranging to pick up the goods at 3:00 PM. At that time, Chinese and foreign detectives went to the room and saw Sun lying in bed, eating "red pills" under the light. There were 36 "red pills." They arrested him. Under the bed, they found a large package of prepared raw materials for "red pills," including 37 pounds of medicine powder, 4 ounces of arsenic, and 2 pounds of Western medicine. Along with the smoking paraphernalia and "red pills," they were taken to the police station and detained. The next morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department described the case, stating that the defendant claimed at the police station that the raw materials cost 69 yuan and 35 cents overseas and were purchased from the Sino-European Pharmacy at No. 282 Guangdong Road. They could be used to make 60,000 "red pills." He requested a postponement of the case. Detectives from the Chinese and Foreign Patrols then reported the details of the case. The evidence was presented for inspection. When questioned, the defendant gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be returned to custody for further review at a later date.</p>

Shen Junru reported that the association has a total of 1,092 members after deducting those who had withdrawn. According to the legal quorum, 274 people must be present to hold a general meeting. Since the number of members present today still falls short of the legal quorum, the meeting will be changed to a discussion meeting. The personnel sent by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the courts left after seeing that the meeting had failed. The proceedings of the discussion meeting are excerpted below: (1) Qin Liankui and others expressed the opinion that the association should publish current laws and regulations. The chairman replied that the publication of loose-leaf laws and regulations has already been proposed. (2) The meeting has repeatedly failed to reach a quorum. The question of how to promote a general meeting should be discussed. The members present exchanged ideas and, as a result, summarized the views and solicited the opinions of all members on whether or not they would attend, and then rescheduled the date of the general meeting. Other proposals were left for the next general meeting because the discussion meeting had no voting power. The meeting adjourned at 4:50 PM.</p>

<p>Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Clarifies the Truth</p>
<p>Dispatched by the Fourth Recruitment Office</p>
<p>The 83rd Division Does Not Recruit Soldiers</p>
<p>Ningbo natives Wang Shicheng, Zhang Ruisheng, Zhang Asan, and Gu Xinbo were lured to the Fourth Recruitment Office to serve as new recruits. Wang Shicheng requested leave due to illness and reported the matter to the Ningbo Sojourners' Association in Shanghai, requesting assistance. The association, based on the situation, requested the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to find a way to discharge them from military service. This was previously reported. Since the occurrence of this case, the Ningbo Sojourners' Association sent personnel to repeatedly investigate the truth to clarify the content. They learned that Wang Shicheng and others were transferred from the New Recruit Transit Office of the Fourth Recruitment Office in Shanghai to the Artillery Battalion of the 83rd Division for induction, not directly recruited by the Artillery Battalion of the 83rd Division. The association believes that there were other reasons for the inducement of Wang Shicheng and others to enlist. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Artillery Battalion of the 83rd Division approving the discharge from military service. The Artillery Battalion stated that since the enlistment of Wang Shicheng and others was due to inducement, the request for discharge from military service can be approved, and the three individuals, Zhang Ruisheng, etc., will be handed over to the Fourth Recruitment Office for replacement and supplementation. The recruiters will be severely punished. It is reported that Dong Xinqin, a representative sent by the Ningbo Sojourners' Association, has taken the documents and claimed them, and also sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters explaining the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>Zhu Jiusheng, a native of Wuxian, 23 years old, was employed at the Yongxing Car Side Glass Shop at 156 North Fujian Road. Due to recent financial difficulties, he issued two bounced checks totaling $90. When the check holders came to return the checks, Zhu, unable to find a way to solve the problem, felt ashamed and decided to commit suicide. Yesterday afternoon, he went alone to the Huzhou Hotel on Pintang Lane Bridge, opened room 11, and secretly consumed opium paste to kill himself. The waiter discovered him and urgently hired a car to rush him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died after an hour.</p>

<p>Anle Palace Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession was previously caught by the patrol for allowing customers to dance and play music beyond the time stipulated by the Municipal Council, and was sentenced after being interrogated in the Second Special Court. Recently, the French patrol discovered that the dance hall still dared to exceed the prescribed operating hours. The manager of the dance hall, Chen Zhanxiong, was summoned to the Second Special Court the other day, and the patrol lawyer filed a lawsuit according to law. Judge Xian Hua Sun Peng presided over the trial, and after interrogation, Chen Zhanxiong was sentenced to a fine of $60 for violating the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Li Suzhen Sues for Divorce from Her Husband <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Li Suzhen, a Shaoxing woman, also known as Zhang Li, is 30 years old. In 1920, she married Zhang Keting (49 years old, a native of Ningbo), the manager of the Xinxin Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, through a matchmaker. They lived together in the hotel. The relationship between the couple was initially very strong, and they had three children. However, Zhang recently changed his behavior and became intimate with Ding Laowu, also known as Ding Chen, the master of the Fangshan Five Saints Master Hall at 10 Yuanmaoli, North Zhejiang Road. They made vows of love and pledged to grow old together. As a result, Zhang treated his wife Li and his children as thorns in his eyes. He deceived Li into returning to her hometown, and then welcomed Ding Laowu into his Xinxin Hotel to live with him, effectively taking over the nest. Later, Li came to Shanghai, learned the truth, and found Ding Laowu's clothes and photos in the room as evidence. Considering her husband's conscience, their relationship was truly broken. She hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting a divorce from Zhang Keting and demanding alimony of $1,990 in one lump sum, as well as living and educational expenses for the children of $2,000, etc. The court, based on the complaint, summoned the plaintiff Li Suzhen for questioning in the Civil Court on the other day. Li Suzhen explained the case and said that her husband and Ding Laowu had committed adultery in the Danghu Hotel, which can be investigated and verified. The defendant, Zhang Keting, stated that he knew Ding Lao and had gone to Suzhou to burn incense with her, but there was no ambiguity. As for the Danghu Hotel room, it was opened by his friend Zhang Heming, which can be investigated. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. The court examined the statements and ordered a postponement to January 11, 1935, to summon Ding Laowu to the court for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Brothers in Litigation Over Inheritance <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Feng Konglun and Konghuai, both Cantonese, are sons of Feng Zhaowei. Zhaowei died many years ago. During his lifetime, he was a compradore for the defunct Liru Bank, accumulating considerable wealth. After his death, among the inheritance was a large house located in Dashufang, Shipi Lane, in the city, which had not yet been divided and was kept by Konghuai. In 1924, Konghuai renovated the dilapidated house and rented it out, collecting the rent himself. He then mortgaged the entire property. Recently, the mortgage was about to expire, and he was unable to redeem it. Just as he was about to increase the mortgage amount, Konglun learned of the matter. He hired lawyer Qiu Fenling to file a lawsuit against Konghuai in the First Special District Local Court to divide the inheritance, stating that his father Zhaowei had two sons. His elder brother Kongchang had passed away early, and now only the two brothers remained. However, the defendant had never consulted him regarding the disposition of the jointly owned property, had always collected the rent himself, and now wanted to sell it off without authorization because he was unable to redeem the mortgage. Therefore, he filed the lawsuit. Judge Mo Runhua opened the court yesterday, summoned the two heirs for questioning, and ordered an investigation to clarify the matter before further interrogation.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 1:00 AM, Li Shiyu and Wang Hongren, residents of 6 Xiangxin Factory, Caojiadu North, West Shanghai, were walking near Tanjadu, Zhabei, when they were suddenly ambushed by more than a dozen bandits who blocked their way. They robbed Li of his Zhongshan woolen robe and beat Li and Wang violently, causing injuries to both. Just as the bandits were about to search the two for silver dollars, a patrolling security team happened to arrive, having heard the alert. Seeing the situation, the bandits scattered and fled. The team managed to capture one bandit and recover the stolen woolen robe, taking them back to the station. The bandit identified himself as Wang Xueshi. Since the case involved robbery and assault, he was sent to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau for investigation. After being interrogated by the bureau, the bandit confessed to conspiring to commit robbery, and it was decided to prepare a document and hand him over to the Public Bureau for interrogation.</p>

Together with the gambling equipment, a deck of pai gow tiles, and silver and cash gambling funds, they were all taken to the Caojiadu Branch.

The room attendant pointed out that the two burlap sacks belonged to this person. The police then found two packages of morphine drugs on the passenger. The person and the evidence were taken back to the team. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the captain, Song Haishan, interrogated the suspect, who confessed, "Wei Baogen, 29 years old, a native of Taixing, makes a living selling chickens. The morphine was entrusted to me by Dr. Zhang of Taixing to buy from the Fair Pharmacy in the French Concession for 32 yuan and bring back to Dr. Zhang to prepare medicine. As for the two burlap sacks of raw materials, they are not mine and I know nothing about them." Captain Zhu, considering that the case involved carrying dangerous drugs, violating the criminal law, ordered that Wei be sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Chapter Six: The Poor Girl Should Not Be Ashamed, Freely Regard the Western Teacher, Why Value Empty Words</p>
<p>Before long, the door resounded with a "dong, dong." Jia Duocai responded with an English "Come in." There was a rush of leather shoes, and two foreigners, accompanied by two Chinese, walked in. These two Chinese were Li Shilian and Zhao Guofu, who worked for the Germans. Li Shilian first introduced Mr. Zhao, and then Zhao Guofu introduced them, saying, "This is Mr. Bell, and this is Mr. William." Bell was a short man, about the same height as a Chinese, with a receding forehead, deep-set eyes, and a full beard. William was a tall man with a high, pointed nose, and ruddy cheeks that hinted at beer brewing—a touch of exoticism. They took turns shaking hands with Jia Duocai and sat down in the chairs. In Jia Duocai's mind, he thought their first words would be something like, "We heard that Mr. Jia came from the West, and we greatly admire you and have come to visit." Unexpectedly, Bell crossed his legs and sat down, looking around the room several times, and then said a few words to Zhao Guofu. Zhao Guofu translated, "Mr. Jia, your room is about the same size as ours. How much is it per day?" Jia Duocai was surprised, wondering why they were asking such a question. He replied, "The most expensive hotels in Xi'an aren't as good as small inns in Shanghai. This is very cheap, two yuan a day, and if you stay longer, you can get a 30% discount." Bell then discussed a few things based on the hotel fee. Li Shilian also found this a bit strange. Could it be that they were asking Old Jia about his finances? He couldn't help but look at Zhao Guofu a few times. Zhao Guofu seemed to sense something and said to Li Shilian, "Mr. Li, after coming to Xi'an, which scenic spots have you visited?" Li Shilian said, "The director of the local education department accompanied me to Zhou Ling once." William saw the two of them speaking directly and asked what it meant. Zhao Guofu explained, and then turned back to tell William. (97)</p>
<h3 id="e151">Appealing for the Disaster Victims <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Qifeng Louzhu</p>
<p>In our country, which is feeling such an economic panic, everyone is usually just muddling along, barely holding on. If, unfortunately, we encounter any more changes, there will truly be no way to cope! Like this year's summer, all the provinces suffered severe droughts, resulting in greatly reduced harvests of agricultural products. There are even places with no harvest at all. Now that winter has arrived, this large group of disaster victims not only has no food but also no clothing, suffering from hunger and cold, with no way to survive? Everyone believes that the only relief strategy to temporarily prolong the lives of these pitiful people is "fundraising."</p>
<p>Originally, human beings should have compassion. Conversely, one cannot be considered human without compassion! Those who are well-fed and warmly clothed may still feel discomfort in their lives, lacking delicacies to taste and fine silks to wear! I wonder what their thoughts are when they see the shocking pictures of the disaster areas and hear the tragic cries of people selling their sons and daughters or committing suicide? If you have a heart of pity, you should do your best to help during fundraising, making sure to collect as much money as possible!</p>
<p>However, the disaster area is too large, and there are too many disaster victims. A drop in the bucket is far from enough. Therefore, I have two more thoughts: (1) Although the Boy Scouts' door-to-door fundraising has ended, I hope that kind-hearted people will still act with a sense of their own hunger and thirst, and donate generously at any time, contributing righteous grain and sending it to the relief collection points. (2) I further hope that the great philanthropists who have been fundraising will contribute their small amounts to the public, delivering them to the disaster areas for distribution, which would naturally be immeasurable merit! Although, perhaps this is just the author's overthinking.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Foot Warmer <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Chunyu Louzhu</p>
<p>The wheel of time has turned to the season of cold winter, and the northwest wind howls madly like a lion. After night falls, the god of winter shows his severity even more, gradually spreading thick frost towards the earth, and cold air strikes the poor. The lonely youth, or the wanderer, in the winter night, the only comfort is the foot warmer.</p>
<p>The cold bedding, before going to sleep, is truly a bit frightening. Every night, after taking off the outer clothes and socks, when sleeping inside the bedding, one can only curl up into a ball, truly like a hedgehog in the mountains. Especially the feet feel strangely cold. If there is a foot warmer placed in the bedding, before long, the heat within will spread to the ends of your feet, warm as a virgin. But foot warmers also have their beauty and ugliness. Yixing has porcelain ones, like a pillow. Suzhou has brass ones, like a foot stove. Jiangxi has porcelain ones, like a rectangular box. Japan has rubber ones; one kind is long and slender, and the other is in the shape of a person. The human-shaped one seems specially made, like a human body model. After filling the inside with hot water and placing it in the bedding, it's truly like sleeping with a virgin, but the person sleeping must respect their own personality; otherwise, they will definitely contract the disease of lustful thoughts, so it's better not to use it. However, the selling price is extremely high, almost twenty yen each. In the rural areas of China, in some places, twenty yen could be exchanged for a country girl.</p>
<p>China used these things in ancient times, so there are these two beautiful feminine pronouns: "Embrace the bamboo wife in summer, embrace the foot warmer in winter." I am afraid these are used by some lonely young scholars to comfort their feelings? It's a pity I don't know which classic it comes from.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Talking about Woolen Cloth <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>There are many types of woolen cloth. The most famous ones are naturally Zhigong cloth, Worth cloth, and overcoat cloth. Almost everyone knows this. It was originally a foreign product, but recently, although some Chinese can make it themselves, firstly, there are not many types, and secondly, Chinese people prefer to use foreign goods, so the sales of foreign woolen cloth are still very strong, and the outflow of money is self-evident. The reason why woolen cloth is loved is because it is a wool fabric, durable and wearable; and because it is a foreign product, everyone regards it as a modern clothing material. The fact that Zhigong cloth has real and fake versions proves how much woolen cloth is loved.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to examine when woolen cloth first entered China. Li Ciming's "Yue Mantang Diary" has a passage saying:</p>
<p>"Bought a feather weave silk 'weikuan' hat, paid one 'zhifanyin'. This silk is called 'ni' (woolen cloth), from the West, people compete to wear it, not knowing why; and the court and the commoners all make it into hats. Since the middle of spring, the emperor has used it, almost becoming a standard."</p>
<p>This diary entry was recorded on March 14th of the eighth year of the Tongzhi reign (Qing dynasty). Carefully considering the sentence "This silk is called 'ni' (woolen cloth), from the West," it can be seen that woolen cloth was still a newly imported foreign product at that time. "People compete to wear it" shows how many people love to use foreign goods. "Not knowing why" is actually very easy to understand, which is that everyone loves to be modern. "The court and the commoners" "make it into hats," and the use of "all" also proves that woolen cloth was initially only used as clothing material; and the prevalence of woolen hats was around the eighth year of the Tongzhi reign. Li Ciming's "weikuan" hat was bought for "one zhifanyin." "Zhifanyin" is one foreign dollar. This number seems very small now; but at that time, one foreign dollar was worth ten times what it is now, so the price of this "weikuan" hat was not light. "Since the middle of spring, the emperor uses this..." shows that even the palace likes foreign goods and loves to be modern. Looking at the entire tone, it seems that before the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, no one knew about woolen cloth.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that Chinese people have loved using foreign goods since ancient times, and it is even more intense now. Taking woolen cloth as an example, since the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty to this day, it has been imported continuously; the outflow of money must be tens of millions of yuan.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"The Great Immortal is indeed a very respectable title, not easily attainable by ordinary people! And from that day on, the Qing Fox Great Immortal began to treat human diseases: because his magic was very exquisite, he could cure any disease, so his reputation grew day by day, and later the beneficiaries raised funds to build this Fox Immortal Pagoda, devoutly offering sacrifices. Anyone who is sick, just go there to pray, and he will prescribe several kinds of medicine, teaching the patient to take them, and nine out of ten times it will be effective!"</p>
<p>"The Empress Dowager's story ends here." (Translator's note: This story is obviously made up by the author, but it is very interesting and similar to the fairy tales written by the Danish fairy tale master Hans Christian Andersen, so I translated it.) Finally, she got back to the main point. She said:</p>
<p>"Because it has so many miracles, we can't help but go to visit it!"</p>
<p>Everyone who heard the story told by the Empress Dowager found it very interesting; although we are no longer three or four-year-old children, after hearing such a story, we can of course distinguish between its truth and falsehood! And also know why that compassionate Jade Emperor was so lenient towards that offending fox, not only cutting off one of its tails that was not related to life each time but also allowing it to be re-examined once every thousand years; this is not the Jade Emperor being permissive but the negligence of the person who created this story, or his immature thinking.</p>
<p>We are also unwilling to investigate to what extent this story is true and to what extent it is false. Since Fengtian has such a famous scenic spot, we should naturally go there for a visit. (207)</p>

<h3 id="e158">Exchange of Art Between China and Russia <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the President of the Russian Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries</p>
<p>"The sublimity of ancient Chinese art is universally recognized and needs no further promotion. Modern Chinese art is now valued by Europeans, thanks to Professor Xu Beihong's art exhibitions in various European countries. This spring, after Xu Beihong hosted a Chinese art exhibition in Moscow and Leningrad, modern Chinese paintings were well received by the Russian art world and admired by the general Russian population. The exchange of artworks was negotiated by Xu Beihong. The first batch involved Xu Beihong leaving several works as gifts to the Russian Museum and selecting several Russian paintings for exchange. Furthermore, Xu Beihong and the president of the Russian Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries discussed long-term art exchange methods, exchanging several works each year, and stating that Russian artworks should not involve political issues. Recently, I heard that Xu Beihong received a letter from Mr. Anrosev, the president of the society, which briefly stated: 'I was very happy when I arrived safely in your country. The achievements of your exhibition in Moscow and Leningrad and your great art are still praised by the art world here. Cultural cooperation between the two countries will surely make progress after you return to your country. This is very important and concerns the future of our two great nations. The paintings you selected have been ordered to be sent out, and I will also send the pieces you donated to the Hermitage Museum. I have informed Mr. Qian Zhiaxin that when the construction of the new Soviet Palace is completed, we plan to ask you to take charge of the murals. I hope you agree. I sincerely shake your hand and bless you. Anrosev,' and so on. This is the first note of the exchange of art between China and Russia."</p>

<h3 id="e161">High School Excellent Students Held Second Friendship Sports <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Excursion to Longhua to visit Jiangsu Prison, etc.</p>
<p>And invited Mr. Jiang Kanghu to speak on youth movement</p>
<p>The High School Excellent Students Friendship Sports sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Party Department was held for the second time yesterday. The excursion to Longhua started at 8:30 AM. Students from various schools gathered in the auditorium of Lake Society. Under the guidance of Tao Baichuan, Wang Longzhang, and Yu Zhongbiao, members of the Municipal Party Department's Party Education Section, they took cars to visit the Jiangsu Second Prison, the Vagrant Training Center, the Headquarters, the Orphanage, etc., and held celebrity speeches. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Schools: A total of more than thirty schools including Jingzhong, Wuben, Minli, Nanyang, Pudong, Datong, Tongji, Hujiang, Guanghua, Fudan, Fushi, Nanmo, Nangao, Xinmin, Zhengfeng, Xinlu, Kaiming, Huahua, Peiming, Yuqing, Mailun, Zhonghua Vocational, Dagong Vocational, Xinya, Youth Association, Lida, Chizhi, Shangyou, Qingxin, Jianguo, Zhirenyong, Minguang, Guangxia Biwen, and Huadong. There were more than 180 outstanding second and third-grade high school students.</p>
<p>Visiting the Prison: At 8:30 AM, students from various schools gathered at Lake Society, where they were received by Tao Baichuan, Yu Zhongbiao, and Wang Longzhang from the Municipal Party Department. They took five large cars to Caohejing, Jiangsu Second Prison. The staff led them in batches to visit the new prison and the women's prison, etc. They were neat, clean, simple, and unadorned. However, the diet and nutrition were relatively poor. Then they visited the Vagrant Training Center, which housed more than 700 vagrants. There were eight workshops with sixteen kinds of work such as weaving, knitting socks, printing, tailoring, washing, and carpentry. They were quite diligent. In terms of equipment, there were sports fields, clinics, etc., which were also quite adequate and orderly. It was indeed a way to teach vagrants. However, the daily working hours were too long, especially for children. It is said that the authorities of the center are now trying to improve it. After the visit, they took cars to Longhua to visit the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the January 28th Memorial Hall, the Military Law Office Detention Center, etc. Mr. Tao provided detailed guidance and answers. The students were all satisfied.</p>
<p>Celebrity Speech: After leaving the Headquarters, they went to the Orphanage for a week's visit. After a light snack, they gathered in the auditorium of the orphanage to learn from celebrity speeches. Mr. Jiang Kanghu gave a speech entitled "Youth Movement." Mr. Tao Baichuan first gave an introductory speech, and then invited Mr. Jiang to give a speech, saying that the youth movement can be divided into three periods. The first period of the youth movement focused on politics, the second period of the youth movement focused on economy, and now it has entered the third period of the youth movement, which focuses on (1) spiritual cultivation, (2) physical exercise, (3) training in group life. Today's youth movement can start from the youth themselves, which is very reasonable, etc. Mr. Jiang's speech cited ancient and modern evidence and lasted for an hour before it ended.</p>
<p>Next Friendship: Finally, Mr. Tao Baichuan reported on the next friendship plan, which has been decided to be a discussion. It is divided into four groups: the first group discusses further education and reading, the second group discusses employment and service, the third group discusses thoughts and beliefs, and the fourth group discusses love and marriage. Each group invites one expert as a tutor to answer questions separately. The meeting is scheduled to be held in two weeks, and the location is planned to be borrowed from Wuben Girls' High School. After the report, the meeting was adjourned. Students from various schools took the original cars and returned in batches.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Chinese Painting Association Membership Meeting Exhibition Postponed <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to insufficient quorum, a discussion meeting was held instead.</p>
<p>This year's election decided to continue using the postal election method.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Painting Association has worked extremely hard to promote Chinese art. This year, it published a monthly magazine of Chinese painting, which is rich in material and beautifully printed, and is especially popular throughout the country. Because the term of the second executive and supervisory committee members has expired, the association held a membership meeting yesterday at its office in Central Society on Weihaiwei Road. Representatives from the Municipal Education Bureau, Ding Shoutang, and members Yan Gan, Yuan, He Tianjian, Ding Nianxian, Jiang Yinan, Zhang Yuguang, Chen Ziheng, Wang Yiting, Wang Jimei, Chen Xiaodie, Jiang Yanan, Sun Xueni, Qian Shouti, Xu Muru, Jiang Yingzhi, Yao Mocun, Hou Yehua, Cai Yimin, Zhu Rongzhuang, Shi Chongpeng and dozens of others attended. Due to insufficient quorum, a discussion meeting was held instead. The results of the association's discussion are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Matters for Report: Chairman Zhang Yuguang, Recorder Ding Nianxian. After the Chairman's report, Standing Committee Member He Tianjian reported: (1) The accounting section will compile a written report.

<h3 id="e171">German Secondary School Teacher Training (1) <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zhensun</p>
<p>(1) The Objectives of Secondary School Teacher Training</p>
<p>The objectives of secondary school teacher training in Germany can be roughly divided into three types. The first is to train secondary school teachers to be proficient in the teaching materials. This is one of the necessary conditions for German secondary school teachers. When Prussia implemented the qualification examination in 1810, this condition was stipulated. Since then, it has become a firmly established and inherited practice. Therefore, the famous German educational historian Pulson often said, "The group of secondary school teachers is a group of learned people." That means that secondary school teachers should thoroughly understand and be practically proficient in all teaching materials. Otherwise, they are not qualified to teach students. Although this inherited practice has been re-evaluated in the decade after the Great War, it still exists today and is even more consolidated than before.</p>
<p>The reform of secondary school education in Germany after the European War, on the student side, emphasizes the elements of organized, automatic, and active participation. On the teacher side, it cultivates the qualifications of true scholarly and moral leaders. For example, in higher secondary schools, there is often opposition to the rigid practice work, arbitrary teaching methods, and bureaucratic habits of the pre-war era. This new spirit shows that genuine and rigorous scholarship is needed as a prerequisite for being selected as a secondary school teacher. This reform seems to have the following reasons:</p>
<p>If the student's automatic activities and group research-style teaching are to produce possible results, it is essential to have a superior and knowledgeable leader 丨 the influence and guidance of the teacher. If students do not receive the influence and guidance of teachers with profound knowledge, then the element of automatic activity will inevitably degenerate and become romantic. Teachers who are rich in genuine knowledge and research interests can impart this influence and guidance directly or indirectly during class teaching.</p>
<p>Secondly, secondary school teachers should have practical and rigorous scholarship to bear significant scientific responsibilities. Although the modern century can be said to be a scientific century, it can also be said to be a pseudo-scientific century. Because every scientific, political, and social movement often inevitably contains a stimulating effect. Therefore, one of the most important tasks in secondary schools is to lead students to resist all scientific incitement. To achieve this goal, Chinese teachers should have in-depth knowledge of all aspects so that they can guide students and distinguish between true science and pseudo-science.</p>
<p>The second objective of German secondary school teacher training is to impart philosophical knowledge to secondary school teachers. According to the opinion of German scholars in general, secondary school teachers should study philosophy for the following two reasons: (A) Because philosophy has an important place in connecting culture. Secondary school teachers are leaders of adults and minors, so they should have various noble values, such as moral, scientific, and political values, and should have a noble outlook on life. They should also know the practical basic problems in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics. They must also understand the current status of mankind. They should also be prepared to guide young people to cultivate the ideals of truth, goodness, and beauty in their inherent urgency. Therefore, a systematic study of philosophy is necessary for secondary school teachers to adequately cultivate their educational responsibilities. (B) The reason why secondary school teachers should study philosophy is that philosophy and pedagogy have a close relationship. For example, the ideal and practice of education is a proof of the relationship between philosophy and pedagogy. Their relationship has recently been emphasized by Gestalt psychology. Therefore, Gestalt psychology has a tendency to shift the focus of educational psychology away from natural science and back to the philosophical aspects of psychology.</p>
<p>The third objective of German secondary school teacher training is to impart educational knowledge to secondary school teachers. Because in secondary schools, unusual attention is paid to scientific education, and at the same time, various teaching methods have been changed from injection-style to heuristic-style. In order to adapt to this new requirement, secondary school teachers must have educational knowledge. However, German universities offer a large number of courses that provide sufficient educational theory. Most of the educational theory courses are established in the Faculty of Philosophy. In German universities, there is no independent college of education. Therefore, universities often only establish an introductory course in the practical theory of education for cultivating secondary school teachers. However, the university with the most teaching courses established in German universities is the University of Berlin. The following are the educational programs established at the University of Berlin from 1931 to 1932:</p>
<p>Course Name Professor Teaching Day Teaching Record</p>
<p>Social Education Professor Schultze Monday 4 to 6</p>
<p>Comparative Education Professor Kesenbos Tuesday 9 to 10</p>
<p>History of Education (from Solon to Modern) Professor Schultze Monday 8 to 9</p>

<p>The Social Life of Schools and Youth in the World's Major Cultural Countries Dr. Kesenbo Tuesday 6 to 8</p>
<p>New Education Movement Discussion Professor Ropp Friday 6 to 8</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned courses, there are also courses in child psychology, personality education, educational psychology, youth protection law, belief and education, educational regulations, school hygiene, and medical care for children. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Chinese Second Division Cup Final: Jun and Qunhua win the championship <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>3 to 1 against Tiehua</p>
<p>The Qunhua football team, with the remaining power of successive victories, met Tiehua again in Shenyuan yesterday to compete in the Chinese Second Division Cup final. No less than hundreds of people admired and watched from the sidelines. The cheerleaders of both sides kept cheering, so the players in battle were very excited, because the gain or loss of the championship was very important. Unfortunately, the weather was not clear for long, and the field was muddy, which led to dragging mud and water, and the performance was reduced. After the referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle to start the game, Tiehua launched a fierce attack. Within fifteen minutes, they took advantage of the opponent's inner guard slipping and scored a goal. Before long, Qunhua's left inside forward Deng Jinkun received a pass from the center forward, and immediately skillfully dribbled, bravely broke through three barriers, and returned a goal. The first half ended one to one, with the autumn colors evenly divided.</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, Qunhua changed its strategy. Xiao and Tan, the two fullbacks, met left and right, like a natural barrier. Zhu Jiongpei sat in the central plains with a majestic face, making the enemy discouraged and at a loss. Later, Tiehua's inner guard committed a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Qunhua's Liang Yaohong kicked up, hitting the bullseye. After the center point kickoff, Qunhua's forwards became more active. Fortunately, Tiehua's goalkeeper and defenders were able to cope properly and turn danger into safety. However, defending without attacking is not the best policy after all. Qunhua's right wing Zhou Benfang dribbled quickly and was blocked, and immediately passed the ball to the center. Deng Jinkun got the ball, dribbled near the goal, and kicked it in. After that, Tiehua's morale was scattered, and the enemy also believed that victory was in hand, and did not do too much. Therefore, a final was declared closed, and the first Second Division Cup was permanently retained by the Qunhua team. Qunhua's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Rongyi Zhou Yeqin Xiao Guorong Deng Jinkun</p>
<p>Xu Baotu Zhu Jiongpei Liang Yaohong He Sirong</p>
<p>Tan Dapei Wang Changsheng Zheng Jianxi Zhou Benfang</p>

<p>Weihua wins 2-1 in the first half</p>
<p>Neither team scored in the second half</p>
<p>Fudan and Weihua's first teams, in this year's Chinese Association's "Zhong" division, are known as the two heroes. Since participating in the war, they have not been defeated. Weihua defeated Zhenru Merchant Ship Leji, and won three games and three wins. Fudan also defeated Merchant Ship Leji and won two games and two wins. Therefore, the two teams fought in Fudan's stadium yesterday, no less than a final. Although the cold wind was blowing and the dark clouds were densely covered on that day, there were more than seven hundred people who admired the names of the two teams and watched from the sidelines, and even more Fudan students. The shouts of cheerleaders shook the sky and pierced the ears, and the grand occasion was temporary. As a result, Weihua won by a narrow margin of two to one. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun repeatedly saves dangerous balls Fudan yesterday renovated the lineup, Feng Nianhan changed to right wing, Cheng Shichang took the position of left wing, so the front line's attacking power greatly increased. At half past three, Zhou Jiaqi blew the whistle to start the game. At first, Weihua's attack was extremely strong. Zhu Xiaorong and Fu Zhibin and others repeatedly attacked, but they were all rejected by Zhou Dayun, Guan Yu'an and others. Suddenly, Feng Nianhan rebelled on the frontier and dribbled to the center. Tang Xianzhen hesitated slightly, and the ball escaped out of the goal, and sighs rose from the four seats. Suddenly, Fudan's offensive did not decrease slightly. Tang Xianzhen sent Cheng Shichang, Cheng hooked to the center, Yu Shunzhang stood out, rushed past the defender, and hit the corner of the goal with a crisp foot, creating the first record.</p>
<p>Weihua team scored two goals in a row After this strange shame, Weihua launched a counterattack. Li Changchi committed a foul 18 yards from the goal. Xu Jingcheng took a free kick. Zhou Dayun received it and was knocked to the ground. The ball rolled into the net. With the tie established, the fierce battle became even more intense. Fudan's forwards were extremely rampant, but unfortunately their feet were not accurate enough, and they missed every good opportunity. Soon after, Fudan's defender was not careful with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick. Zhu Xiaorong took the shot, and Zhou Dayun fell to the ground to save it, and applause thundered. A few minutes before the end of the first half, Weihua's Huang Jingui single-handedly broke into the forbidden area and shot wildly, and scored again. The first half ended, and Weihua won by two to one.</p>
<p>Neither side made any achievements in the second half In the sound of the restart, Fudan appointed Yang Ronghua and Lu Xiumen as the two wings, and Feng Nianhan retreated to the center to defend in place of Li Changchi, greatly increasing the defensive power. The forwards then attacked with one mind, hoping to wash away the previous shame. Therefore, in front of Weihua's goal, iron riders galloped horizontally and vertically, and dangerous situations occurred frequently. Once, Yu Shunzhang snatched A Dou from among thousands of troops, and hooked it back. Wu Qixiang was agile and willing to pay for it. Time passed easily, and forty-five minutes passed easily. Under Zhou Jiaqi's long whistle, a fierce battle came to an end.</p>

<p>Yuqing is also given a considerable warning</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese School Sports Federation held an emergency meeting at Chi Chih College at 2:00 pm the day before yesterday (the 22nd) to discuss the unfortunate incident in the Jinan and Yuqing football match. The members present were Guanghua, Yuqing, Fushi, Nanshang, Chongde, Pudong, Jinan, Chi Chih, Fuzhong, Minli, Aiguo, Minli Girls' Middle School and other twelve schools, chaired by Lu Xiangqian and recorded by Wang Fudan. First, Yu Hengzhi, the representative of Jinan, reported on the course of the unfortunate incident, and the school was willing to voluntarily suspend participation in the Chinese school leagues for one year. Two representatives were also sent by the Student Union to express their apologies. In addition to submitting a letter detailing the facts of the incident, Yuqing was also represented by Wan Ziwei, who reported that both schools did not want the situation to escalate and were currently in contact for mediation. Later, the representatives of Jinan and Yuqing withdrew. The representatives of each school based their decisions on the facts reported by both sides and the attitudes of the two schools' authorities, and agreed that Jinan and Yuqing, on the 20th of this month, had the right to compete in the finals of the "Zhong" division football league in Shen. As a result, Yuqing won by a score of three to one. After the game, a few Jinan players and a group of students who knew the truth beat Yuqing players and students for no reason, resulting in a bloody tragedy, and also damaged the office of the Xiehe Association. This kind of action is extremely indecent, and it is clearly contrary to the purpose of this association to promote sports. It is impossible to rectify the discipline without severely punishing Jinan Affiliated Middle School, and it is impossible to set an example for others. Therefore, the following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>(1) Starting from today, Jinan Affiliated Middle School will be suspended from participating in various competitions of this association, and its membership will be revoked.</p>
<p>(2) The aftermath of the injured players of Yuqing will be resolved by the two schools' authorities themselves, according to the report of the Yuqing representatives.</p>
<p>(3) A letter will be sent to the Yuqing authorities that they should restrain their athletes when participating in various sports competitions in the future.</p>
<p>(4) This association will send a letter to the Xiehe Association to apologize, and order the Jinan authorities to compensate the Xiehe Association for the losses caused by the damage, and apologize to the association.</p>
<p>(5) In the future, in the various leagues of this association, each school shall not have the organization of cheerleaders.</p>
<p>(6) In the future, in the various leagues of this association, in addition to the sports instructors, the schools participating should send responsible personnel to the scene to take care of them. If an incident occurs, they shall be fully responsible.</p>

Among them, the most admirable was He Baoshan, who came from Jinshan to Shanghai to participate. He took the lead from the start and led the way all the way until the sixth lap when he was overtaken by the veteran Wang Zhenglin. His spirit was truly amazing. Jin Zhongxing and Wu Hanzhang, who came from Wuxi to Shanghai to participate, finished third and fourth. The results of yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>3,000-meter performance competition (1) Wang Zhenglin (Shanghai) 10 minutes and 7 seconds, (2) Guan Youwen (Shanghai) 10 minutes and 8.6 seconds, (3) Wu Hanzhang (Wuxi) 10 minutes and 9.6 seconds, (4) Jin Zhongxing (Wuxi), (5) Zhang Liang (Shanghai) (6) Lv Changgeng (Shanghai), (7) Yang Qingshe (Shanghai) (8) Wang Rulin (Shanghai), (9) Wan Jinsheng (Shanghai), (10) He Baoshan (Jinshan), (11) Pan Gongbao (Shanghai), (12) Jin Zhongkang (Shanghai)</p>

<p>— Lecture by Wang Qizhang, Notes by Chen Sheng Bai Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>How was medical education in our country in the past? How is it now? How will it be in the future? Domestic experts on medical education rarely discuss this, so today's Chinese medical education, and its future trends, are still like a misty Lushan Mountain, and its true face is difficult to discern. On November 23rd, we were honored to have Mr. Wang Qizhang come to our school to give a lecture. He gave a very detailed explanation of the past, present, and future gains and losses of medical education in our country, and elaborated more on the current crisis in medical education. Like clearing away clouds and mist, his methods of correcting biases and saving from shortcomings are precisely to the point, and are particularly thought-provoking. Therefore, I recorded it and submitted it to this publication for the reference of those who care about medical education. Recorded by the reporter at Southeast Medical College in Shanghai</p>
<p>1.  Difficulties in the Construction of Chinese Medical Education</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen: If we compare building a house on a blank piece of land with demolishing an old house and building a new one, the former only involves construction without destruction; the latter requires destruction first, and then construction can be carried out. The difficulty of the two is naturally different.</p>
<p>China has a history of four or five thousand years, and has been a land of culture since ancient times. All kinds of learning can be said to have existed early on in ancient times. For example, in medicine, there were Shennong and the Yellow Emperor... in engineering, there were Luban and Gongshuzi, Liezi... and there are countless other examples in agriculture and commerce. Because we have our own inherent culture, if we compare it with the cultural history of various countries in the world: in terms of otherworldly religious thought, the Chinese nation is not as good as the Indian and Hebrew nations; in terms of metaphysics, the Chinese nation is not as good as the Greek and Germanic nations; in terms of natural science thought: China cannot be compared with the modern Western European countries. Medicine belongs to the scope of natural science, so to completely transform Chinese medicine into scientific medicine, it is necessary to remove many unscientific obstacles inherent in China, and then we can take the scientific knowledge of the world as our own. In other words, we must first go through a process of destruction, and only then can we talk about construction, thus making it a very difficult thing.</p>
<p>2.  The Purpose of Importing Foreign Culture</p>
<p>Before discussing the main topic, we should first understand the purpose of importing foreign science. The purpose of importing foreign scientific culture is roughly:</p>
<p>(1) Aggressive, passive, originally we didn't need it, but they want to force it in. Their goal is to seize the authority in industry, commerce, and economy in the target country, and use preaching as a pretext for political activities.</p>
<p>(2) Conscious, automatic, needed, because our own culture is not enough, or perhaps there is none, or it is not as good as others. In the face of inferiority, we consciously decide to use it to supplement and reform. This can be said to be the true culture of the country, and the true knowledge of the people.</p>
<p>3.  Past Chinese Medical Education</p>
<p>Observing from what I have said above: current Chinese education has indeed encountered major problems. Since the opening of the sea ban, foreign countries have used various methods to carry out their aggressive tactics. For example: first by means of trade, then by means of preaching. The purpose of trade is to seek economic aggression: the purpose of preaching is nothing more than containing political attempts: of course, this so-called cultural import is also one of the aggressive policies! So I dare to say: there is no morality, no justice, and no academic contribution in the international arena; even if there is, it must have a background and a function. Most of them wear a mask, but the skills are different. As for medicine, although on the surface it is universal love and mutual assistance, without regard to race or national boundaries, treating all people and all regions equally, in essence, it is still false and colored. I hate to say: the purpose of foreigners coming to China to educate is not sincere at all, they are all smiling daggers, honey in the mouth and a sword in the belly, doing deceptive education. Isn't the Red Cross flaunting universal love and salvation? But in times of war, which country doesn't first rescue its own wounded soldiers and its own people? Chinese medical education, after being carried out to this point, it must be said that it has a considerable history, but how much is conscious and automatic? I dare to say: it is completely controlled by the great powers and the foreigners.</p>
<p>There are two types of education:</p>
<p>(1) Colonial Education This is passive, aggressive education, it is education of Dissimilation.</p>
<p>(2) National Education This is automatic, conscious education, it is education of Assimilation.</p>
<p>Let us recall what kind of Chinese doctors were educated by foreigners in the past? Most of them were hired servants in churches. Foreigners took advantage of the opportunity to preach and taught them some things. After reading a simple book and memorizing a few drug names, they could become doctors. Nurses who spent their days in several church hospitals were given diplomas and qualified, and enjoyed a superior position in society. From these points of view, past Chinese medical education was foreign aggressive education, it was education of alienation, it was merely adding claws and teeth to foreigners and gaining convenience for political and economic aggression!</p>
<h3 id="e184">Current Status of the New Medical Community in Yuyao <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhenjia</p>
<p>Transportation...New Medical Community...Charitable Organizations...Physician Qualifications...Consultation Fees and Drug Costs...Obstetrics...New Medical Organizations</p>
<p>(1) Transportation Yuyao is a rich area. It borders Hangzhou Bay to the north, Shangyu to the west, and Yinxian to the south. It borders Cixi to the east. It is divided into seven districts. On land, there is the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, as well as the Yu-Zhou-Sheng, Hu, Zhou, Cao Highways. Waterways have steamships and fast boats. Transportation is quite convenient.</p>
<p>(2) New Medical Community After the first year of the Republic of China, there was a shortage of new medical personnel. In addition, the people's intelligence was simple and shallow. They had no understanding of practicing physicians and had a fearful view of hospitals. Although there was a church hospital in the county, the Yongji Hospital in the Sixth District, and a hospital organized by physicians who had studied in Japan in the Fourth District, medical services were not very developed. Over the years, the hospital in the Fourth District moved away from Yao. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, new medical personnel emerged in large numbers. The number of practicing physicians in the interior gradually increased. The people's faith also gradually became stronger. For example, the towns of Mazhu, Simen, Linshan Hushan, Lishan, Zhouxiang, Changhe Shiandong, etc. have gradually developed.</p>
<p>However, the belief in new medicine is mostly among the intellectual class. Unfortunately, it still cannot surpass the families with old-fashioned ideas. The qualifications of the new medical personnel in Yuyao are average. Although the medical services are good, it is even more difficult to surpass the old doctors. The people's basic needs of clothing, food, and housing are not in line with modern hygiene principles. Extrapolating to the whole country, let alone. If we want national health, if we want to deeply believe in scientific medical common sense, if we want to solve the difficulties of practicing in the interior, we rely on wise governance and the joint efforts of medical colleagues to thoroughly resolve it.</p>
<p>(3) Charitable Organizations (1) Simen is a major town in northern Yao. It has always had the Tongchun Medical Bureau. Consultation fees and drug costs are completely free. After eight years, due to the lack of people's intelligence, although it was free, the number of patients was still small. Therefore, it was discontinued. However, in reality, apart from the Tongchun Medical Bureau, there is no successor who provides free diagnosis and medicine to the people. It is regrettable.</p>
<p>(2) In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, an epidemic spread throughout the county. The people of Simen lamented the high mortality rate, which was rare in previous years. They specially organized an epidemic hospital. After three months, more than 3,000 people were saved. Almost twenty-one years later, the epidemic resurged. The county towns of Simen and Linshan organized temporary epidemic hospitals. Towns such as Zhouxiang also successively organized epidemic prevention hospitals. Looking at the history of epidemic hospitals, Simen is the first. The depth of publicizing the people's belief in new medicine is also Simen. Who can deny it?</p>
<p>(4) Physician Level There are about twenty graduates from schools. There are graduates from both domestic and foreign schools. However, there are only five or six formally licensed doctors practicing in the county. Others also come from major hospitals. The ethical concept of physicians is also good. There is no factional division. No one uses advertisements to attract patients.</p>
<p>(5) Consultation Fees and Drug Costs Consultation Fees... Most practicing physicians charge less than half a yuan for consultation fees. Some even charge no fee. (The average in formal hospitals is about twenty cents.) Therefore, poor patients can all benefit from it.</p>
<p>Drug Costs... Practicing physicians in the interior must provide their own medicines. As for serums, most of them prepare essential and practical ones. Internal medicines (two-day dosage) cost less than five cents. Injections of Yellow Pigment 914 only cost a little over a yuan, which is different from the new doctors in the city.</p>
<p>(6) Obstetrics Those who specially set up flat rate obstetrics departments for the public, such as Hui'ai Yongji and Simen Tongchun Hospitals. However, apart from difficult labor, there are few ordinary consultations. The Fourth District plans to establish a flat rate obstetrics society to raise funds and recruit talents. When the time comes, it will be a great blessing to society. Midwives are all domestic graduates. There are dozens of them. The fees are also cheap. Unfortunately, it cannot be fully popularized. Ignorant women's families have a fearful and shameful mentality towards midwives. Therefore, they have no idea of midwives in their minds. They would rather donate their lives to traditional midwives and old doctors, and be superstitious. Even if they die, they have no complaints. It is very regrettable.</p>
<p>(7) New Medical Organizations Although there are many qualified new medical personnel in Yuyao, such as the Physicians' Association and the Pharmaceutical Association, none of them are organized. Although there are proposals, they are discussed but not decided. Decided but not implemented. It has become a county-level discussion. Looking back at the old doctors, they have quite a strong ability to unite. Our new doctors are actually lagging behind. Therefore, if we want to solidify the foundation of new medicine, if we want the daily renewal of scientific medicine, if we want to guide and instill the mission of public health, we must organize groups. Otherwise, we will only be ridiculed by the enemy. Fellow pioneers, what advice do you have for me?</p>
<h3 id="e185">Common Treatment Methods for Fever <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>For patients with intestinal bleeding, diet should be completely stopped. When the mouth is too dry, a small amount of water can be drunk to stop the dryness. The patient must lie still and move as little as possible. Intravenous injection of glucose water. Injecting morphine to reduce intestinal peristalsis is also very beneficial. Oral administration of calcium chloride, subcutaneous injection of thirty to forty cc of one's own or someone else's blood can make the blood coagulate quickly and stop intestinal bleeding. A small amount of blood transfusion also has a great effect. After the bleeding has completely stopped, the patient can gradually resume eating from a very small amount. The above are the most important points in the latest treatment of typhoid fever. The common methods for treating various fever diseases have been described in detail before. Due to the limited space and scope of this topic, I cannot describe all the methods for treating typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(1) Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is a long-term fever disease, and it is also a fever that lasts the longest, often lasting for months or years. Therefore, treatment must also be aimed at long-term effects. The family must recognize that tuberculosis is a serious disease. Treatment must also be conscientious and do everything possible. Paying a considerable price will yield considerable results. The treatment method is briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) Rest Severe tuberculosis requires bed rest. Mild tuberculosis should also stop working. Severe tuberculosis requires bed rest day and night, and bowel movements should not be done out of bed. Rest must also be both physical and mental, that is, the body must be in bed and the mind must also stop worrying and all plans. Complete rest until the fever stops for several weeks before implementing the recovery period treatment method (details above).</p>
<p>(2) Diet The diet must be full of nutrients and easy to digest. The patient must have a considerable diet because nutrients are directly proportional to resistance. Nutritious foods must be a balanced and appropriate combination of rice and noodle foods, meat, milk, vegetables, and fruits. Some people think that meat is rich in nutrients and eat only meat.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>That is not right. Food should only be about six or seven tenths of rice and noodles, and the rest three or four tenths.</p>
<p>(3) Air Those with mild illness can choose outdoor occupations. Those with not too severe illness can also sit, walk, or eat outdoors. In summer, it should be for ten hours a day, and in winter, it should be for six hours a day. Pay attention to not letting the patient get cold or hot. Those with severe illness should place the bed on the sun deck or in a room with the window open, as long as wind and rain are avoided. In winter, cover thickly and don't be afraid of cold air. It must be known that fresh air is the most important element for treating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(4) Treatment of High Fever High fever requires rest. The diet must be full of nutrients enough for the body to consume and have surplus. The most suitable method for reducing fever is hydrotherapy. For those with not too high fever, wash the body once or twice a day, and add a cold wet pad to the forehead. Fresh air should circulate in the sick room. When the fever is high, you can also wrap the body with a wet sheet.</p>
<p>The above are a few important points for treating tuberculosis. I hope the family pays special attention to implementation. There are many other fever diseases, but they are not as important as typhoid fever and tuberculosis. Common treatment methods for fever can also be implemented.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This article has described in detail the theory of treating fever. In order to suit any fever disease, the title is Common Treatment Method for Fever. If the patient can carefully study and implement according to the method, they should be able to benefit a lot. Now, the outline of this article is put forward so that readers can see it at a glance.</p>
<p>(1) Fever is the result of the war between bacteria and the body's resistance. We should not only seek to reduce fever, but also seek to remove the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>(2) The first urgent task of treatment is rest, bed rest, and physical and mental rest. The sick room should be clean and quiet, with fresh air circulating. Sufficient sleep is very important.</p>
<p>(3) Diet Sufficient drinks. When the patient cannot drink water, the foreign injection method must be used. Food should mostly be liquid. When the patient is not sleeping, have a small meal about every two hours, with several kinds of food per meal. During fever, the body consumes one or two times more than usual, so the nutrients in the food must also be equal to the consumption, so that the body's cells can not be damaged.</p>
<p>(4) Oral Hygiene The patient should brush their teeth and rinse their mouth after each meal. Tooth powder and toothpaste can be used. When the breath smells strong, use a half-and-half mixture of double-salt water and water to wash the mouth. When the toothbrush cannot be used, gauze can be wrapped around it instead of a toothbrush.</p>
<p>(5) Skin Hygiene Wash the body with soap and clean water at least once a day. Two or three times a day when the fever is high.</p>
<p>(6) Gastrointestinal Hygiene Pay attention to easy digestion of food.</p>
<p>(7) Mental Hygiene Rest assured, do not seek luck, do not be superstitious, seek proper treatment methods.</p>
<p>(8) Hydrotherapy reduces fever It is beneficial and harmless to the body and organs. Common hydrotherapy includes (1) adding a cold wet pad to the forehead. (2) Wrapping the body with a wet sheet. (3) Sprinkle water to reduce fever. (4) Wet sheet bath. (5) Half body bath. (6) Full body bath.</p>
<p>(9) Help internal excretion Taking diuretics is beneficial to the body.</p>
<p>(10) Drug Treatment The purpose should be to reduce pain. Do not use drugs to reduce fever when there is no pain. Although these drugs can reduce fever, they also reduce resistance at the same time, so do not take antipyretic drugs for a long time, and do not take too much.</p>
<p>(11) First aid for fainting Oral administration or injection of cardiotonic drugs. Help blood flow to the limbs so that it does not accumulate in the abdomen.</p>
<p>(12) Recovery Period Treatment Method The patient should not stop resting immediately after recovering. According to the general law, after the fever stops, rest for another three days for every three days of fever, and rest for another three months for every three months of fever before returning to the original work. After throat rash, scarlet fever, and nephritis, extend the rest period especially.</p>
<p>(13) Practical application of treatment methods ○(1) For typhoid fever, special attention should be paid to rest. Pay special attention to food that is free of residue (green vegetables and hard foods should not be eaten), easily digestible, mostly liquid, and full of nutrients. Pay attention to hydrotherapy to reduce high fever. Intestinal bleeding requires temporary cessation of eating. Gradually eat after the bleeding has completely stopped.</p>
<p>(14) For tuberculosis, pay attention to rest during fever. Also pay special attention to sufficient nutrients, easily digestible food, and as much fresh air and sunlight as possible.</p>
<p>(15) The remaining fever diseases can also be implemented according to the general treatment principles. (End)</p>

<p>(49) Intestinal Obstruction (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Q) What is called intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) Intestinal obstruction refers to various clinical symptoms caused by blockage or difficulty in passing through the intestinal tract.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) The causes of intestinal obstruction can be divided into two major categories: mechanical and functional.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the mechanical causes of obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) There are also many mechanical causes of obstruction. The first is changes in the structure within the intestine, such as congenital qualities, such as imperforate anus, rectal stenosis, small intestinal stenosis caused by fetal peritonitis, etc., as well as intestinal cancer, ulcerative intestinal stenosis, etc. The second is due to compression outside the intestinal tract, such as ovarian cysts, uterine tumors, pelvic abscesses, omental cysts, wandering kidneys and spleens, Baer's disease, gas obstruction, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any other causes of mechanical obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) There are also intestinal intussusception, strangulation, volvulus, fecal impaction, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the functional causes of obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) The functional causes of obstruction are: First, paralytic obstruction, which is often complicated by acute generalized peritonitis, or prolonged laparotomy resulting in intestinal cooling, or caused by mesenteric hemorrhage, acute gallstones, or kidney stones causing colic, torsion of the intestinal tumor stalk, testicular trauma, strong abdominal wall collision, pancreatic necrosis, spinal cord injury, intestinal vascular embolism or thrombosis, intestinal water puncture, etc. There are also those caused by temporary incomplete paralysis of the intestinal tract. The second is spastic obstruction, such as lead poisoning, irritable patients, after laparotomy, or overexcitation of the vagus nerve.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) The symptoms are related to the cause of the occurrence; therefore, there are occlusive, strangulating, paralytic, and spastic distinctions.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of occlusive intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) This is intestinal stenosis or even occlusion. Therefore, the contents of the upper intestine of the occlusion stagnate and expand. If the intestinal tract can actually open up the stenosis and transport the contents, then the peristalsis of the intestinal tract is hyperactive, and the abdomen shows an uneasy state of peristalsis. In the dilated part of the intestine, gases are generated because the digestive products are mixed with the secretions. These gases are oscillated by irregular intestinal movements and produce various noises. Intestinal peristalsis is irregular, causing abdominal pain. In addition, because of the stenosis or occlusion, the contents of the intestine become more and more accumulated, reaching the stomach and hindering the function of the stomach, causing belching and vomiting. The intestinal wall becomes thin due to excessive expansion. The intestinal mucosa is eroded by the toxic products in the intestine and causes ulcers. If the ulcer reaches the deep part, it can cause the intestine to rupture.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of strangulating intestinal obstruction?</p>
<p>(A) In the early stage, the patient's intestines have hyperactive peristalsis, and the contents show a state of emptiness; if the degree increases, then the nerves will lose the ability to manage movement, thus promoting the generation of gas in the intestine, the constricted part expands, and eventually perforation occurs. At the beginning, the arteries are relatively less invaded, only the veins are obstructed, preventing the passage of blood. Therefore, hemorrhagic mucus seeps out in the intestinal tract, intestinal wall, mesentery, and intestinal contents. Within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, it turns dark blue and falls into intestinal gangrene. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e187">A General Discussion of Malaria <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>Malaria Pathogen</p>
<p>The malaria pathogen is the malaria parasite, which can be divided into three types: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium falciparum. The former two are larger, while the latter is smaller. All use mosquitoes as their primary host and humans as their intermediate host. They parasitize the human body, reproducing asexually. In the mosquito, they reproduce sexually. However, in the mosquito body, the temperature must exceed eleven degrees Celsius for development to occur, so malaria is not transmitted in winter. When a mosquito transmits malaria parasites to a human, it enters the bloodstream with saliva during the bite, attacking red blood cells and digesting hemoglobin, forming Mielanin pigment. It gradually develops and grows, and when mature, it splits into numerous merozoites, rupturing old red blood cells and invading new ones, repeating the development and division. Since no sexual conjugation occurs in the human body, it is called asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>The merozoites that develop and divide in human blood, attacking new red blood cells, include a portion that develops into female or male gametocytes. Those of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae are mostly spherical, while Plasmodium falciparum are crescent-shaped. These gametocytes do not mature in the human body and must be ingested by a mosquito to separate from the blood cells and develop into female and male gametes. The male gamete then develops flagella-like structures that conjugate with the mature female gamete, forming an oocyst in the mosquito's stomach. Upon maturation, it divides into numerous sporozoites, which migrate to the salivary glands via the lymphatic and blood vessels. When the mosquito bites and sucks blood, the sporozoites enter the human body with the saliva. The reproduction of malaria parasites in the mosquito involves conjugation of female and male gametes, hence it is called sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Plasmodium vivax is found throughout China. It is actively motile within red blood cells and matures in about forty-eight hours, dividing into fifteen to twenty merozoites each time. The parasitized red blood cells are slightly larger than normal and produce a lot of melanin. Plasmodium malariae is mostly scattered in the central and southern provinces. It is not motile in red blood cells, only its melanin granules exhibit molecular motion. It matures in about seventy-two hours, dividing into nine to twelve merozoites each time. Plasmodium falciparum is mostly found in the central and southern provinces, and occasionally occurs in the north. Its maturation period is irregular, ranging from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. It divides into seven to twelve merozoites each time, but schizogony usually occurs in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, brain, etc. The parasitized red blood cells are smaller than normal and produce less melanin.</p>
<p>Malaria Transmission Vectors</p>
<p>The vector for malaria transmission is the mosquito. Common species in China include Culex and Anopheles. Culex mosquitoes are vectors for avian malaria and are not related to human disease, hence the pseudonym "common mosquito." Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors for human malaria, hence the pseudonym "malaria mosquito." Currently, more than two hundred species of Anopheles mosquitoes have been discovered globally, but only fifty or so have been proven to transmit malaria. In 1929, Fanst reported that only fourteen species of malaria mosquitoes had been discovered in China. Including recent reports, there are still only about twenty species. Three of them have been proven to transmit malaria. The main vector for malaria transmission in the mountainous areas of the northern provinces is Anopheles pattoni. In the plains areas of the whole country, it is Anopheles hyrcanus var. sinensis. In the southern provinces, it is Anopheles minimus.</p>
<p>Malaria mosquitoes differ from common mosquitoes in that their antennae are as long as their proboscis, their wings have black and white spots, their bodies are gray, and their legs have white rings or white spots. When resting, their body and proboscis form a straight line, and their abdomen is far from the wall, forming an angle with the attachment point, resembling an arrow stuck to the wall. Their legs are mostly drooping. The eggs they lay are shaped like jujube pits, scattered and not sticky. When the larvae live on the water surface, their bodies are parallel to it, they have no conical respiratory tube, and they have palm-leaf-like hairs. The pupae's respiratory tubes are short and wide. Common mosquitoes have shorter antennae, their wings have no spots. When resting, their bodies are flat against the wall or their tail is near the wall, and their hind legs are bent to their back. The eggs they lay are clustered like boats. The larvae have slender conical respiratory tubes, no palm-leaf-like hairs, and when they live on the water surface, their tail is close to the water surface and their head is tilted downward. The pupae's respiratory tubes are long and narrow.</p>
<p>Malaria mosquitoes prefer to fly low, fear wind and sunlight, hide during the day and come out at night. They mostly breed in clear, algae-filled rivers, lakes, and swamps. Males only suck plant sap, while females suck blood. Only sexual reproductive bodies of malaria parasites can develop in malaria mosquitoes. Asexual reproductive bodies are digested without effect when they enter the stomach. According to James (1926), sexual reproductive bodies appear in the blood only ten days after a person contracts malaria. Malanang (1931) reported that each cubic millimeter of blood must contain forty-two Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes or ten Plasmodium vivax gametocytes for malaria mosquitoes to become infected. From the time a mosquito sucks blood into its stomach to the time sporozoites are found in its salivary glands takes about eight to ten days at twenty-five degrees Celsius. At lower temperatures, it takes fourteen to eighteen days. If it drops below fifteen degrees, the malaria parasites stop developing.</p>
<p>Malaria Pathology</p>
<p>When malaria parasites are introduced into human blood by malaria mosquitoes, they multiply by division. Symptoms only appear when the blood contains hundreds of parasites per cubic millimeter. After the onset of the disease, each time malaria parasites undergo schizogony and merozoites burst into the blood, the toxins they produce stimulate the vasomotor nerve center, causing a reaction. The patient then experiences chills and fever. Therefore, the new merozoites that are released into the blood during schizogony are called pyrogenic substances. When Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium malariae is about to cause an attack, schizonts of the malaria parasite can be seen if the blood is examined. After the attack, ring forms can be seen in a blood test. However, schizogony of Plasmodium falciparum occurs in the liver, spleen, brain, bone marrow, etc., so it is often difficult to find schizonts in blood tests even at the beginning of an attack. In severe cases nearing death, malaria parasites accumulate in the blood and are very easy to detect, even present in every blood cell.</p>
<p>Patients with malaria show symptoms in various organs, with the spleen being the most obvious. This is generally due to the accumulation of malaria parasites and the melanin they produce. The spleen usually weighs about 150 grams, but after contracting malaria, it can increase to over a kilogram. It becomes congested and enlarges during fever and shrinks when the fever subsides. In chronic malaria, the splenic tissue proliferates, hardens, and does not resolve, which the Chinese commonly call the "malaria mother." Malaria parasites continue to reproduce by schizogony, and red blood cells rupture continuously, resulting in hemoglobin loss, often leading to anemia. In chronic malaria, it becomes malarial cachexia. Other organs such as the bone marrow, liver, kidneys, and lymph nodes also accumulate malaria parasites and melanin, causing the bone marrow to appear dark black, or liver jaundice and kidney congestion, etc. If malaria parasites and melanin fill the cerebral capillaries, they can also cause severe neurological symptoms such as coma and convulsions.</p>
<p>Different species of malaria parasites have different effects. Although a patient may have immunity to one species, they are still susceptible to others. Malaria can be transmitted by mosquito bites or blood transfusions to prove this. Koch once found that the blood of black children on the east coast of Africa always contained malaria parasites. As they aged, the number decreased, eventually leaving only spleen enlargement. However, cases of illness were very rare, or symptoms were very mild. By adulthood, they were almost never infected, indicating they had natural immunity. Also, in areas where malaria is prevalent in Taiwan, Taiwanese people have mild cases, while Japanese people who reside there often have severe cases, because the natives have a considerable degree of immunity from an early age. However, the immunity of malaria sufferers does not last long. People who live in malaria-prone areas and do not show symptoms, if they leave for a long time and then return, are still susceptible.

<p>Chapter 8: Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>(4) Blood Examination</p>
<p>In addition to the blood morphology described above, the sedimentation rate of red blood cells is also a very important issue in diagnosis. According to Linsenmcier's method, the normal sedimentation rate is about 600 minutes for men and about 200 to 350 minutes for women. It has no specific value for pulmonary tuberculosis. Conditions like high fever, inflammatory conditions, malignant tumors, fractures, syphilis, ordinary pregnancy, and tissue destruction of lesions can all increase the sedimentation rate, which is sometimes similar to the condition of this disease. Therefore, the value of this examination in this disease is not to distinguish whether it is present or absent. What we use it to clarify is: Is the disease in an acute progressive stage? Or has the lesion reached a quiescent state? This judgment is not of great importance for the diagnosis of this disease, but the prediction of the prognosis and the current treatment and recuperation plan are completely based on this. In addition, this examination is usually repeated after five or six weeks: This can also be compared with the previous one and know how the disease is progressing in this short period? Is it more advanced than before? Is this treatment effective? This genuine understanding of the disease, which contributes to the report of clinical symptoms and the findings of physical examinations, is very significant.</p>
<p>The value of serological tests in the diagnosis of this disease is very limited. As for examining for tuberculosis bacteria in the blood, there are no significant results due to the blood pigment inhibiting their proliferation. The details of this are certainly not something that the average person can understand, so I will not discuss them here. (End of blood examination)</p>

<h3 id="e189">On Attitude Towards Life <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>Arishima Takeo once divided people's attitudes towards life into three categories: one is to reminisce about the beautiful dreams of past life, which belongs to memories; one is to yearn for the beautiful dreams of future life, which belongs to fantasy; and one is to value the present life, which belongs to the so-called "human beings." Regarding the third category, he once said:</p>
<p>"No matter how beautiful the past life is, it is always over; no matter how magnificent and splendid the future life is, it has not yet arrived. Therefore, we should recognize the value of the present as supremely high and go all out to pursue it."</p>
<p>People who hold the first two types of attitudes towards life seem to be committing the mistake of refusing to think, or they are paralyzed by the so-called "inertia of thinking." If they just think a little, this truth is clearly visible. The so-called "past" is the former present, and the "future" is the future present. In short, the past and the future are both incarnations of the present.</p>
<p>Because of dissatisfaction with the present, people begin to sink into the realm of memories and fantasies. Generally, people who are immersed in this realm have never felt satisfied in the past. Although they are currently uttering dreamlike praises of the past, they will feel the same dissatisfaction with the future, although they are now verbally extolling the future. Whether it is reminiscing about the past or pursuing the future, satisfaction with the present life will never be obtained. Those who are tempted by beautiful dreams then wither and age pitifully, spending their lives in a dim existence. Because of this, their lives will never have any achievements, and their spirits and bodies will perish at the same time.</p>
<p>Among people, there seems to be a common ailment: they always feel that what has been lost or not yet obtained is valuable, and they regard the height of demand and the difficulty of obtaining as "directly proportional." This may be one of the reasons for weaving beautiful dreams of past or future life. Moreover, people who miss the past often completely forget the defects of past life, but gradually expand its small, beautiful aspects in their consciousness, thus appearing all kinds of "non-human" realms. People who yearn for the future seem to be going one step further to find their "fairyland," without even a hint of basis. They are far away from the real society, not only not advancing the wheels of society, but also indirectly affecting the progress of mankind.</p>
<p>No matter how much mankind progresses, the defects of the human world will eternally exist. But it is also because of these defects that they arouse dissatisfaction with present life. A perfect thing is always accompanied by more or less defects. Shirakawa Hakumura once wrote an article about "defects," which was extraordinarily poignant, meaning that the existence of defects is actually sufficient to set off the existence of perfection. People who often cite defects as regrets should understand this point. There is another reason for dissatisfaction with present life that should be mentioned here, that is, the desires of mankind are endless and become deeper and deeper. If one feels pain because desires cannot be filled, that is a very erroneous idea.</p>
<p>The writer Lyman Abbot's attitude towards life is expressed in an article titled Which Both in the following way: "We should not come to this world to be leisurely and comfortable like living in a hotel, lying leisurely on the sofa, enjoying exquisite meals, and having such attentive service, where you can just press a bell for anything; we should enter the world like entering a hospital, where there are many patients waiting for us to diagnose and treat, where there is only hardship and disease." Holding such a serious attitude towards life is extremely valuable; this attitude can also be said to be the only way to relieve the troubles of present life.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of humorous attitude towards life, which is to sing life and savor life. It seems to have been written in "Prison Diary" about listening to the sound of shackles as beautiful music; isn't that quite meaningful?</p>
<h3 id="e190">On the Riverbank <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Fu</p>
<p>In desperation, we climbed onto the riverbank via a small, winding path. The vast, boundless Yellow River had been left behind, and what lay before us was still the vast riverbank. In the dim moonlight, standing far away, were only blurred dark shadows, which were probably the small villages.</p>
<p>The sound of the waves in the river hitting the riverbank was even louder and more terrifying at this time. The alarming rumors about the riverbank that had been instilled in my mind made me hold the greatest vigilance, stunned, gazing blankly around, forgetting the biting cold wind. We looked at each other, and after one last hesitation, Zhang Jun carried my larger luggage roll and chased after the other two guests.</p>
<p>"Follow with your suitcase!" he ordered me in a hurried tone.</p>
<p>Zhang Jun was strong and robust, with dark, rough skin, and at first glance, he looked very much like a farmer. I was having trouble with the luggage. He only had a suitcase with him. A companion behind me caught up in fear. I really couldn't imagine where they got the brute strength from, being able to carry very large wicker baskets on their shoulders. In normal times, they would have trouble just lifting them, but now they could rush forward as if nothing were wrong, only daring to throw them on the ground and take a short rest after passing others. They ran for their lives, harboring inner fears, believing that there were "robbers" chasing them from behind. That cunning old boatman, the strong, uncouth sailor: they were the ones. We were completely in their trap—otherwise, why wouldn't they take us to the pier, but instead put us ashore here, in this wilderness? The giant claws of fate grabbed our wildly jumping hearts. But we were not willing to be slaughtered by them like this, and still tried to escape, struggling to the best of our ability. Because I was only carrying a small suitcase, I ran ahead with Zhang Jun, and my heart was relatively calm. Even so, I couldn't care about the wind, the bright moon, the unevenness under my feet, or the frightening roar of the waves hitting the riverbank. All I could remember was following the footsteps of the person running ahead. In addition, I would often suspect that the companion behind me was a "robber," and break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>"Walk inside! Listen!"</p>
<p>Zhang Jun shouted in a rough tone, ordering me not to get close to the riverbank, ordering me to "listen." Suddenly, I noticed that in the "crashing" roar of the waves under the bank, there were occasional "huge sounds" like landslides, sent from the continuously collapsing river's edge. I understood the reason why the boatman couldn't take us to the pier. A memory flashed through my mind like lightning! The terrifying legend that the Yellow River could collapse, flooding dozens of miles at a time, and that even riding a horse would not be enough to escape. I instinctively ran towards the inner bank. At the same time, I thought in my heart that this was just doing everything in my power, and that it was inevitable that I would be swept into the roaring waves.</p>
<p>"Watch your step!" Another impatient warning.</p>
<p>In front of us was a cemetery, only about fifty or sixty steps away from the river's edge. Because the Yellow River would soon collapse and flood it, the filial sons and virtuous grandchildren had already exhumed their ancestors' bones and transported them to a safe area, leaving behind empty holes one after another. We carefully stepped over the raised mounds between the holes. Soon, we heard the huge sound of the collapse behind us, and I immediately determined that what was collapsing was the cemetery.</p>
<p>"Do you hear whistling?"</p>
<p>A companion behind me asked in a low, steady voice. His startled eyes were wide open, shining in the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Do you hear whistling?" I asked back, while also questioning myself. Maybe I heard it, maybe I didn't, I couldn't answer. He said he definitely heard it—two sounds. In that case, I concluded that I had also heard it. Whistling was the signal for the "robbers" to gather. What would come next? We felt it deeply, and quickened our pace even more, pricking up our ears and carefully searching our surroundings to see if there was any movement.</p>
<p>After a while, we discovered the sound of steel colliding, "clang, clang," behind us. "What?" The answer that immediately came to my mind was "knives!" For a long time, we held our breath. They came closer and closer, unexpectedly letting us pass and walking forward. Indeed, it was "knives," hanging on the waists of two "dockworkers" in "oiled leather clothes." They were whispering to each other—we tried our best to hear what they were saying, but couldn't.</p>
<p>Because of the threat of these two "dockworkers" walking in front, our pace slowed down, and we paid more attention to the movements behind us, looking around to find a path and a place to hide, preparing to escape. After a while, the companions who had fallen behind also caught up, looking at each other with official-language eyes, whispering timidly. After all, many people gathered together could give each other courage and make them feel a little bolder. Even though we clearly knew that even if only one "robber" blocked our path, we would be captured. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e191">Returning from the Volcano (3) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>After eating the snacks, my legs really felt stronger. I carried my baggage with a stick, like a country person entering the city, and walked straight into the hot spring. This was a Turkish-style bathing place, using naturally emitted hot air for bathing. In Japan, this is called "steam bath." It is said that people with skin diseases, typhoid fever, colds, and other diseases will get better after a steam bath. Therefore, people go there for bathing all year round. We put down our things and went to take a bath. Men and women bathed separately, each having a bathroom, but there was no door in between, which made me very unwilling to go in. The Japanese were incomprehensible. On the one hand, feudal ideas were especially strong, and men and women really had an attitude of not touching hands, but on the other hand, men could walk into the women's bathhouse to rub the women's backs.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Yang urged me several times, I resolutely walked in. The bathroom was very small, only as big as a Shanghai garret. The water in the pool was cold. Although there were several rubber water pipes, not a drop of water came out.</p>
<p>"How can we wash like this? There is only cold water. Alan, go quickly and ask the gentleman where the hot water is."</p>
<p>While we were laughing so hard that our stomachs hurt, a voice from next door told us to first go into that cave for a steam bath and then rinse with cold water. Sure enough, we pushed open the door and found a black cave like a tomb. It was full of hot steam, and we couldn't see anything. Sitting on the square floor, I felt a kind of comfort I had never experienced before. After a while, my whole body was covered with steam, going from warm to hot. There was a one-foot-sized window in the cave, but it was obscured by the steam and was as dark as if I was lying in a tomb. Running out of the cave, I really felt as cold as if I had fallen into a water cellar. To avoid getting sick, I had to rinse with cold water again.</p>
<p>After washing, we ate dinner. After dinner, we took a few photos and then started heading towards our destination.</p>
<p>"Now that everyone has eaten, you must be strong. Let's walk faster. We have to come back in the afternoon to catch the three o'clock boat!"</p>
<p>Mr. Qin warned us like this, but we were still flying around like a group of birds out of a cage, picking good flowers when we saw them, and lingering to admire the good scenery.</p>
<p>The weather was as clear as in June, and Mount Fuji could be seen very clearly. At first, we walked, admiring the scenery on both sides, and didn't feel very tired. Later, as we walked further and further, our steps gradually slowed down. Everyone kept asking the guide, "How much further?" "Only halfway there!" He answered us effortlessly, and we felt numb all over when we heard it. Heavens, when will we see the volcano?</p>
<p>Suddenly, we walked into a forest with ancient trees towering into the sky. The lush green branches and leaves blocked the sky, and the sunlight shining through the gaps in the leaves fluttered like golden threads. The road was very slippery. If you weren't careful and fell, you would fall dozens of feet. I flew down from the top of the mountain like ice skating, and I was the first to discover the vast, rootless desert!</p>
<p>Ah! Great, great desert!</p>
<p>When my eyes first came into contact with this vast, boundless desert, I really felt an unspeakable surprise. I walked step by step on the sand, thinking in my heart: Properly experience the taste of being in the desert. When talking about other people's works or writing my own articles, I always shout about this desert-like life, this desert-like existence. I'm afraid very few people have experienced what the desert looks like and what life in the desert is like.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Last Night <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>It was a bitterly cold, snowy night.</p>
<p>Fifty-eight-year-old Dahai, on this night, pulled his rickshaw, walking on the deep streets. 丨丨</p>
<p>Dahai had left his home more than an hour ago. His home was a dilapidated, low house. Living with him was his mother, even older than him. The two had lived in this house for several years.</p>
<p>His mother was at least eighty years old. Her hair was all white, her eyes blurred, her ears deaf, and she walked slowly. This senile appearance fully revealed the sadness of her old age. But her son was just as old. They had no hope, relying solely on the money from pulling the rickshaw to live. After today, they didn't know what tomorrow would bring.</p>
<p>They often went hungry. Since the advent of buses and trams, the rickshaw business had become terrible. Especially for Dahai, being so old, as soon as people saw his white hair, no one wanted to hire his rickshaw, because he walked so slowly, and they feared he might fall and overturn the rickshaw and people into the river, or be too slow to avoid traffic, causing a major accident. Those who hired rickshaws were all young rickshaw pullers; Dahai, after only a few steps, would pant "hulu, hulu" with his mouth, his pace as slow as an ox plowing dry fields.</p>
<p>Dahai only knew how to pull a rickshaw, he couldn't do anything else, and there was nothing else available for him to do. Considering his age, it really wasn't the time to be pulling a rickshaw, but if he didn't pull a rickshaw, besides begging on the streets with his old mother, was there any other path he could take? In this day and age, is begging easy? There are countless beggars in the city, starving all day long! Seeing this, Dahai had no choice but to risk his old life, and run out onto the road to pull a rickshaw in this extremely cold winter.</p>
<p>Inside the house, an oil lamp was lit.</p>
<p>Dahai's mother sat in front of the lamp, finishing a little more than half a bowl of watery porridge, her stomach still a little hungry. Looking in the pot, there was only a little more than half a bowl left, but Dahai's mother stopped eating, saving it for Dahai. She thought Dahai would be pulling a rickshaw tonight, and his stomach should be a little fuller. For a rickshaw puller, just eating such thin porridge was already not enough to be full, and if he ate even less, wouldn't he be even hungrier earlier? So when Dahai asked:</p>
<p>"Mother, are you still hungry?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm already full," the mother replied straightforwardly.</p>
<p>"Eat a little more?"</p>
<p>"No, you eat, you have to… have to pull a rickshaw tonight…"</p>
<p>The mother spoke, her words filled with bitterness. Dahai saw that she wasn't eating, so he swallowed it all in one gulp. After finishing the porridge, Dahai walked out of that dilapidated house.</p>
<p>Outside the door was an extremely cold, snowy night.</p>
<p>The mother waited anxiously for her son in the house. Midnight passed, but Dahai still didn't return. Waiting through the night, after dawn the next day, Dahai's mother went out to watch and wait, but the unfortunate news was blowing into her ears. The news was that Dahai, while pulling his rickshaw last night, had accidentally lost his footing while passing the North Star Bridge and had fallen into the river and frozen to death...</p>
<h3 id="e193">Cocoon (3) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— (Original by Hayao Hayashi) Translated by Jingzi</p>
<p>Regarding Sakai, there was another inexplicable thing I didn't understand. It was that in the drawer of his desk, there was always a small, white silkworm cocoon. No matter when, no matter how I asked him, not only would he never tell me the reason, but he would also get angry and use scissors to smash the cocoon skin to pieces. That day, he wouldn't talk to me. After a week, he would put a new cocoon in the drawer again.</p>
<p>Soon, these two inexplicable mysteries were finally solved at the same time.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>It was about two or three days after the incident.</p>
<p>Sakai suddenly invited me out and took me to a small silk factory by the coast. It seemed he came here often. He nodded slightly to the doorman and walked into the factory. At this time, I followed him in.</p>
<p>The factory was filled with steam, like a kitchen on a rainy day. Inside the dark factory, large drive belts were constantly turning the slightly old-fashioned silk reeling machines. The stench of silkworm pupae and the heavy, humid air like a foggy day were suffocating. In front of the female workers, there was one large and one small boiling pot. In the small pot, white silkworm cocoons were boiling. The boiling cocoons were thrown one by one into the large pot. These cocoons jumped constantly in the boiling water, gradually shrinking. Almost invisible thin threads passed over the heads of the female workers and were wound onto the silk reels turning in the back. Following the turning of the drive belts, the silk reels became thicker and thicker, but the silkworm cocoons became thinner and thinner. Finally, the cocoons were stripped bare, and the ink-black corpses of the silkworm pupae floated on the water.丨丨 I stared strangely.</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment!"</p>
<p>Sakai walked into the space between the machines and disappeared. Soon, he came out with an old woman wearing a female worker's uniform.</p>
<p>"This is my mother."</p>
<p>"Ah!?"</p>
<p>Before I could express my surprise, I hurriedly and awkwardly lowered my head.</p>
<p>"Mom, please thank him."</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3 id="e194">Reasons for the Tragic Decline in Prices <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>In the modern economic organization system, everyone with a little economic common sense should know the importance of the price issue. Because the price issue is indeed an important issue in economic problems. The impact of prices is very widespread. Price fluctuations are directly related to the interests of each individual. We all know that the income of ordinary people is relatively fixed; or rather: the variability is very small (not invariable). If prices suddenly rise and income remains unchanged, the result is equivalent to an increase in expenditure. This is enough to affect the livelihood of people who live on fixed wages. Conversely, if prices fall and income remains unchanged, the result is equivalent to an increase in income. From this perspective, a price drop seems more advantageous than a price increase. However, in fact, it is quite the opposite. The harm of a price drop is even greater than a price increase. A price drop is the beginning of economic decline. Because of the price drop, general enterprises immediately become stagnant, goods cannot be sold at good prices, and profits are meager. General enterprises then engage in contraction. As a result, the pain of unemployment falls on the majority of people. It is unfavorable to individuals, to society, and to the country. Therefore, the harm caused by price drops is greater than the harm caused by price increases. Therefore, regardless of whether prices rise or fall, price instability is unfavorable to all parties, and price drops are particularly harmful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in recent years, prices in our country have been falling frequently. The average price in various places in the past few months of this year has fallen by about one-quarter compared to the average price in 1931. In other words, goods worth one hundred yuan in 1931 can now only be sold for seventy-five yuan. Price drops are very harmful, and this time the price drop is very drastic. What is the reason? This is a question that is worth discussing. We are willing to explain what we know below.</p>
<p>Prices are divided into wholesale and retail based on different properties. The difference between the two can be seen from the definition of the words, so there is no need to explain in detail. However, the change in retail prices always rises and falls with wholesale prices. Therefore, this article uses wholesale prices as the basis for discussion, and retail prices are omitted.</p>
<p>Price is the price of goods calculated in silver dollars. Every item has its price. Each item has different prices, and rises and falls vary. Discussing the rise and fall of prices, if we study the price of each item one by one, it would be very troublesome, and the economic significance would be quite limited. Therefore, the study of price issues focuses on general prices, not on the individual price of each item as the object of study.</p>
<p>The tool for studying prices is the price index. The price index is a method of averaging out the general trend of various changes in prices, and expressing it as a relative number to observe the average change of various prices. This is called the price index. There are five types of price indexes: the "Shanghai Wholesale Price Index" compiled by the National Tariff Commission, the "North China Wholesale Price Index" compiled by the School of Economics of Nankai University, the "Nanjing Wholesale Price Index" compiled by the Ministry of Industry, the "Hankou Wholesale Price Index" and the "Qingdao Wholesale Price Index." The national wholesale price index has not yet been published. However, the regions represented by the above five indexes are the main commercial centers of our country. Therefore, from their changes, we can see the general trend of price changes across the country.</p>
<p>Let's compare the indexes of various places separately: The average index of the Shanghai Wholesale Price Index from January to April this year fell to 96.2; a decrease of 9.6% compared to the same period last year (1933); and a decrease of 18.1% compared to the same period in 1932. The average index of the North China Wholesale Price Index from January to May this year was 91.0; a decrease of 14.0% compared to the same period last year; a decrease of 23% compared to 1931. The Nanjing Wholesale Price Index averaged 81.4 from January to March this year, a decrease of 17.1% compared to the same period last year; and a decrease of 18.4% compared to the same period in 1932. The average index of Hankou from January to March fell by 16.5% and 24.5% respectively compared to the same period last year and the year before last. The index of Qingdao fell by 9.9% and 11.7%. The indexes of each month this year have gradually decreased. Judging from the recent situation, the trend of price index changes is still downward. In the near future, it will be difficult to rise.</p>
<p>In addition to calculating a total index, each local price index also calculates classification indexes separately based on the different properties of various goods. It is divided into eight categories: food, textiles and their raw materials, metals, fuels, building materials, chemicals, and miscellaneous items. The following table lists the average index of each month of each local classification index and the rise and fall compared with the same period last year. From this table, we can see the degree and trend of price drops of various goods.</p>
<p>Table 1: Comparison of Wholesale Price Indexes in Various Places with the Same Period Last Year.</p>
<p>Food Textiles Fuel Metals Building Materials Chemicals Miscellaneous Total Index</p>
<p>Shanghai 丨-9.6 丨-9.3 丨-1.0 丨-8.2 丨-8.8 丨-7.2 丨-7.2 丨-9.6</p>
<p>(丨-10.5) Ten</p>
<p>North China 丨-23.1 丨-3.0 丨-10.0 丨-12.9 丨-9.9 丨-10.8 丨-14.0</p>
<p>Nanjing 丨-21.0 丨-11.4 丨-11.3 丨-20.9 丨-9.6 丨-15.3 丨-17.1</p>
<p>Hankou 丨-24.0 丨-7.2 丨-18.6 丨-3.8 丨-12.8 丨-16.5</p>
<p>Qingdao 丨-15.6 丨-15.4 丨-6.1 丨-5.6 丨-8.8 丨-2.4 丨-9.9</p>
<p>Shanghai is the average index from January to April; North China is the average index from January to May; Nanjing, Hankou, and Qingdao are the average indexes from January to March. The "Ten" under the Shanghai column is a comparison of other food price indexes.</p>
<p>From the table, we can see that among the various indexes, regardless of the total index and the classification index, only the "miscellaneous" item of the North China Price Index has risen compared with the same period last year, and the rest have fallen. Moreover, among the classification indexes in various places, the food category has fallen the most drastically. For example, the average food index in Hankou in March this year fell by about 24% compared with the same period last year. The North China food index fell by 21%. The Shanghai food index fell by 19%. The Qingdao food index fell the least, but it also reached 15%. There is another "other food index" category in the Shanghai price index classification. This index has fallen less compared with the same period last year, with a decrease of 10%. The next is the metal index. The decline in various places is also quite considerable. Furthermore, the fuel and miscellaneous indexes have also fallen to a considerable degree. The textile and building materials, chemicals, etc. have fallen relatively slightly.</p>
<p>The classification of wholesale price indexes is further classified according to the manufacturing process or degree of processing of the goods. Among the price indexes in various places, only the North China Wholesale Price Index is classified in this way. The classification method divides various goods into two major categories: "raw materials" and "manufactured goods." "Raw materials" are further divided into "agricultural products," "animal products," "forest products," and "mineral products." "Manufactured goods" are further divided into "production goods" and "consumer goods." The following table compares the average index of the first five months of this year with the index of the same period last year:</p>

<p>This year compared with last year 丨-8.9 丨-13.3 丨-11.5</p>
<p>According to the above table, comparing the classification by processing degree, the index of raw materials has fallen the most drastically. The average for the first five months of this year is only 72.8, a decrease of approximately 18% compared to the same period last year. The manufactured goods index averaged 103.9 for the first five months of this year, which is slightly higher than the 100 index for the base year of 1926, but still significantly lower than the previous one or two years, with an estimated decrease of 11.5% compared to the same period last year. Further analysis reveals that among raw materials, agricultural products have fallen the most sharply. The average for the first five months of this year is only 60.2, a decrease of 25% compared to the same period last year. Forest products are next, with a decrease of 15.5%, mineral products with a decrease of 9.5%, and animal products with a decrease of 6.3%. Among manufactured goods, the consumer goods index has fallen more significantly, with a decrease of 13.3% this year compared to the same period last year, and production goods with a decrease of 8.9%.</p>
<p>Let's briefly speculate on the impact of this widespread price decline. According to the classification of processing degrees, the price of raw materials has fallen more sharply than that of manufactured goods. This is of great benefit to entrepreneurs, as they can purchase raw materials at a price drop and sell them at a market price with a lighter price drop after a manufacturing process, which is enough to make a profit. Therefore, this price drop is beneficial to manufacturers. Among raw materials, agricultural products have fallen the most sharply, which is most unfavorable to farmers. Due to continuous natural disasters and man-made disasters in the past, it has been difficult to cultivate the land. In recent years, the civil war has subsided slightly, and farmers have been able to sow. As a result, agricultural products have had a good harvest, but unexpectedly they have encountered a tragic price decline. Farmers work hard all year round, and the gains are not even enough for the original cost of seeds, not to mention the extortion of surcharges and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, this price decline is most unfavorable to farmers. The general price decline is quite beneficial to consumers with fixed incomes, but it poses a major obstacle to the economic development of our entire society. The harms of price declines have been described in detail in the first paragraph of this article, so I will not repeat them.</p>
<p>The process, degree, and impact of the price decline are as described above. Please proceed to discuss the reasons for the decline. On this point, opinions differ greatly among commentators. Due to the limited space in this article, it is impossible to list each opinion one by one. There are many reasons for the price decline. Now, I will only state the three reasons that we consider important.</p>
<p>The first reason for this tragic price decline is the weak purchasing power of the general population. Years of frequent civil wars have left people in dire straits. There was a major drought in the northwest in 1929, and a national flood in 1931. After the September 18th Incident, there were also foreign troubles, and enemy cavalry roamed freely. The economy of the people was declining and exhausted, and business operators were generally wary. Sales were sluggish, and the market was abnormally depressed. Factory closures and bankruptcies were common. Unemployment gradually increased. Those who were fortunate enough not to lose their jobs were barely coping. Although prices were cheap, people were unable to buy. Merchants had no choice but to sell goods at low prices because no one was buying them, so prices plummeted, forming this unprecedented tragic decline.</p>
<p>The second reason can be attributed to the rise in silver prices. This can be seen from two aspects. China is a silver standard country. A rise in silver prices means an increase in the purchasing power of money. The purchasing power of money is directly proportional to the general price level. Now the purchasing power of money has increased. Therefore, a price decline is a natural result. Another explanation is that the rise in silver prices is viewed from the perspective of gold standard countries. For our country, which is a silver standard country, it would be more reasonable to say that gold prices have fallen. The result of the rise in silver prices, or the fall in gold prices, is a drop in our country's foreign exchange rate. According to the Tianjin-Shanghai Foreign Exchange Index (including the exchange rates of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries in Tianjin and Shanghai) compiled by the School of Economics of Nankai University, the average index from January to May this year fell by 21% compared with the same period last year, and by 34% compared with the same period in 1932. A drop in the foreign exchange rate means that although the gold coin price of foreign goods in foreign countries has not increased slightly, it can be converted into a lower silver coin price according to the current exchange rate. Selling at this lower price in China can still recover the original cost. In the past few years, the prices of various countries have been very low due to the general economic decline, while the prices in our country have remained very high. This is because the low silver prices have led to high gold prices. Now that silver prices have risen and gold prices have fallen, prices have fallen. Furthermore, the gold price has fallen so sharply that prices in our country have plummeted. Foreign goods still occupy a major position in our country's market. The fall in gold prices has led to a fall in the prices of foreign goods. As the prices of foreign goods fall, the prices of domestic goods must also fall, resulting in this widespread price decline.</p>
<p>The third reason is due to the dumping of goods by various countries. Because of overproduction, various countries cannot accommodate it domestically, so they have to find markets abroad to serve as the final outlet. Various countries compete fiercely with each other, so they mostly adopt dumping policies. Our country has always been a major sales market for various industrially advanced countries, so various countries ship goods here to practice dumping. Foreign goods are cheap, and domestic goods have no choice but to lower their prices accordingly. Not only that, the result of the dumping of goods by various countries overseas also affects our country's export trade. For example, silk and tea are our country's main export goods. In recent years, due to the dumping of similar goods by other countries overseas, the overseas sales of domestic goods have been sluggish. Overseas markets have been seized, export volumes have decreased, and prices have naturally plummeted as a result. Therefore, the dumping of foreign goods is also one of the reasons for this price decline.</p>
<p>The impact of price declines on the entire society is really great and huge. This is also one of the obstacles to China's economic development. If the obstacles are not removed, progress will be difficult. We have briefly explored the process and reasons for this price decline and described them as above, hoping to provide some reference for those who pay attention to or study economic issues.</p>
<h3 id="e195">China's Auditing Problems <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>A lecture by Lin Jinyu, recorded by Ye Daguang</p>
<p>|| December 6th, lecture at Jinan University's Business School ||</p>
<p>Fellow students, I am honored to be invited by the Chairman and Dean of your esteemed university to speak on the auditing problems in China. This issue may seem small, but if one were to delve into it, it is quite vast. I will now provide a general overview. Regarding the auditing problems in China, they can be discussed in terms of authority, organization, and methods. I will begin with the authority of auditing, which can be demonstrated through the practice of auditing organizations.</p>
<p>(I) The Authority of Auditing in China</p>
<p>Speaking of authority, the power of auditing in China already had a form during the Song Dynasty; it was not something created in the Republic of China. However, delving into historical research would be too lengthy, so I will skip that and begin with the Republic of China. In the first year of the Republic (1912), the Central Auditing Office was established. In addition to the Central Auditing Office, each province also had its own provincial auditing office. At that time, emphasis was placed on pre-audit (audit before the event) as well as post-audit (audit after the event). However, pre-auditing was never truly implemented. Later, the Central Auditing Office was renamed the Auditing Yuan (院, Court/Council). Here, I must first clarify what is meant by pre-audit and post-audit. Pre-audit, for example, is like this: you invited me to give this lecture and hired a car to pick me up from my home, paying two dollars for the car fare. Before these two dollars can be paid out, the accounting department must prepare a payment voucher, signed by the department head and the dean, and approved by the president. Only after the audit department has reviewed and signed it can the money be paid out. Another example is when Jinan University receives funds from the Ministry of Education; it must first be notified to the Ministry of Finance, which then issues a payment order, which is sent to the Auditing Department. The Auditing Department reviews and signs the order, then returns it to the Ministry of Finance for disbursement. This is what is called pre-audit. As for post-audit, it is like the example of the two-dollar payment mentioned above, but the payment is made first, and then all the receipts are collected and submitted for review every month or at certain intervals after the fact.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Auditing Yuan during the Beijing Government era, the pre-audit system disappeared, but post-audit continued for national debt. Even when the Nationalist Government was in Guangdong, pre-audit was not restored. It was only after the Nationalist Government established its capital in Nanjing and established the Auditing Yuan that pre-audit was restored, but it was only for reviewing and signing payment orders from financial institutions. In April of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Auditing Yuan was renamed the Auditing Bu (部, Ministry). The decision to rename the Auditing Yuan to the Auditing Bu had already been made in the 18th year of the Republic (1929). Although the promulgated Organization Law of the Control Yuan of the Nationalist Government did not yet include provisions for pre-audit, the government authorities already had this intention and felt that the importance of pre-audit was such that it had to be restored. As for how to restore it, the Central Political Conference discussed it and stipulated the authority of the Auditing Bu to "review and approve payment orders and revenue orders of all government-affiliated agencies throughout the country." Later, the Organization Law of the Auditing Bu was promulgated, and in the 20th year of the Republic, the Auditing Yuan was renamed the Auditing Bu. Its authority was also expanded, not limited to the review of payment orders, but also to the review of revenue orders, and its scope was not limited to financial institutions, but included all government-affiliated agencies throughout the country. Its review was meticulous, such that even the small two-dollar car fare mentioned above had to go through pre-audit. However, to this day, this authority has not been fully implemented. Currently, auditing is still limited to reviewing and signing payment orders from financial institutions. The current auditing law is still the old auditing law; the new auditing law has not yet been promulgated. Once the new auditing law is promulgated, it will be implemented.</p>
<p>Next, I will talk about post-audit. As for what it is like in the United States, what it is like in Japan, what it is like in France... there is no need to talk about them; let's just talk about what it is like in China itself. Post-audit has a long history in China. The words "Auditing Yuan" already existed during the Song Dynasty; this is based on historical research, so there is no need to elaborate. Since the establishment of the Central Auditing Office in the Republic of China, from the Central Auditing Office being renamed the Auditing Yuan, to the Auditing Yuan being renamed the Auditing Bu, emphasis has always been placed on post-audit. Post-audit involves various agencies submitting receipts and accounting statements to the auditing agency for review after financial transactions have occurred. Even when the Nationalist Government was in Guangdong, there was such post-audit. As for the content of post-audit, it is the review of the "calculations" and "final accounts" of various agencies. This can be seen from the provisions of the Organization Law of the Control Yuan of the Nationalist Government regarding the authority of the Auditing Bu. The Organization Law of the Control Yuan of the Nationalist Government stipulates that the authority of the Auditing Bu includes "reviewing the calculations and final accounts of all government-affiliated agencies throughout the country." However, only calculations have ever been reviewed, but final accounts have never been reviewed, because China has never prepared final accounts. The so-called final accounts here are not the final accounts prepared separately by one or two departments or agencies, but comprehensive national final accounts, which require the submission of final accounts from all agencies across the country to prepare complete final accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to the pre-audit and post-audit discussed above, there is another authority of auditing called "inspection." The amended Organization Law of the Control Yuan in the 18th year of the Republic (1929) stipulates that the authority of the Auditing Bu should include pre-audit, post-audit, and also an inspection authority. Article 5 of the amended Organization Law of the Control Yuan clearly stipulates the inspection authority as "inspecting unlawful financial activities and acts of disloyalty to duty of all government-affiliated agencies throughout the country." As it appears now, the inspection authority is related to financial supervision and has a broad scope. However, the inspection authority is not something new. The former pre-audit and post-audit both included this authority, but it was not explicitly separated. For example, if a house is built, whether it is pre-audit or post-audit, the review must verify that it was built in accordance with the law, and that is the exercise of the inspection authority. The provisions for the inspection authority are largely due to the efforts of various Party and state leaders at the time. The amended Organization Law of the Control Yuan in the 18th year of the Republic clearly stipulated it. However, it was not implemented when the Auditing Yuan was reorganized. It was not until September of last year that the Auditing Bu established the Third Department to carry out the inspection authority.</p>
<p>Going back to the classification of these three authorities, in the 18th year of the Republic, the foreign advisor Mr. Kemmerer advocated that the inspection authority should be independent of the pre-audit and post-audit authorities. However, I have a supplementary opinion: the inspection authority has its own independent status. The Auditing Bu is under the Control Yuan, and its authority is divided into (1) pre-audit, (2) post-audit, and (3) inspection. Some people disagree with this view. In fact, the agency that exercises the inspection authority should be completely separated from the Auditing Bu, because inspection not only pays attention to whether financial operations are economical, but also pays attention to their effectiveness. Separating inspection from auditing allows inspection to achieve its true purpose. Mr. Yong Jiayuan strongly advocates this in his "Chinese Government Accounting Theory." Mr. Ren Yingzhong also agrees with my opinion and wrote an article in the Accounting Magazine. Mr. Jiang Mingqi has an article entitled "The Evolution of the Inspection Authority," published in the Auditing Special Issue of the Central Daily News, which also advocates separating inspection from auditing. This is a good idea, but it is difficult to strictly regulate it in legislation. However, my intention at present is not to insist on absolutely separating and independent the inspection authority from the auditing authority, but simply to hope that it can be done in this way. In reality, the inspection authority has not yet reached the point where it needs to be independent.</p>
<p>The authorities stipulated by the Organization Law of the Auditing Bu are these three, and there is also an item related to pre-audit, post-audit, and inspection called the budget. The Organization Law of the Control Yuan stipulates that the Auditing Bu has the authority to "supervise the execution of the budgets of all government-affiliated agencies throughout the country." The purpose of our pre-audit, post-audit, and inspection authorities is only to see whether they are based on the budget. Therefore, whether it is pre-audit, post-audit, or inspection, they all supervise the execution of the budget. As for how to supervise the execution of the budget, there are detailed provisions in the Auditing Law.</p>
<p>(II) The Organization of Auditing in China</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the organization. We must first understand these three authorities before we can study its organization, because the organization follows the authorities. That's why I first talked about its authorities and then its organization. The Auditing Yuan of the Beijing government divided auditing officials into auditing officers, associate auditing officers, and accounting officers. The department heads under the Auditing Yuan were concurrently held by auditing officers, and the section chiefs were concurrently held by auditing officers or associate auditing officers. When the Nationalist Government was in Guangdong, the Control Yuan had an auditing section, which was later renamed the auditing division. After the capital was established in Nanjing, the Auditing Yuan was established again in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), with two departments for pre-audit and post-audit. Later, the Legislative Yuan decided on the Organization Law of the Auditing Bu, stipulating that the first department would be in charge of pre-audit, the second department would be in charge of post-audit, and the third department would be in charge of inspection. Regarding auditing personnel, the former Auditing Yuan of the Nationalist Government also divided them into auditing officers, associate auditing officers, and accounting officers, but the word "officer" (官) was removed. Auditing officials were protected. During the Nanjing Auditing Yuan era, it was stipulated that the President and Vice President were also protected, and auditing officers and associate auditing officers were all protected. Later, when the Auditing Bu was reorganized, there were some changes. The Minister and Vice Minister were no longer protected. Later, the Vice Minister was changed to two Vice Ministers for political affairs and administrative affairs, and they were also not protected. Only auditing officers, associate auditing officers, and inspectors were protected. The qualifications for auditing officers were that they must be graduates of universities with majors in economics, law, accounting, etc., and have held senior positions above the rank of Jianren (簡任). The qualifications for associate auditing officers were also that they must be university graduates, but there was no requirement for official positions, as long as they had several years of relevant experience. Inspectors had the same qualifications as associate auditing officers. The title of accounting officer was abolished and changed to assistant. The Auditing Bu had a total of nine to twelve auditing officers, twelve to sixteen associate auditing officers, and eight to ten inspectors. The department heads were appointed by the Minister from the auditing officers, and the section chiefs were appointed by the associate auditing officers. The auditing and inspection duties of various agencies in Beijing were handled by the auditing officers, associate auditing officers, and inspectors in the Bu who did not concurrently hold the positions of department heads and section chiefs. There was also a special organization called the Auditing Conference. The Auditing Conference was organized by the Minister, Vice Minister, auditing officers, and other personnel. All important matters were submitted to the Auditing Conference for decision. The purpose of this Auditing Conference was to reduce individual responsibility and be jointly responsible internally and externally, be impartial, not be swayed by personal relationships, and not be afraid of powerful figures. Judicial officials are required to be impartial in judging cases, so they must be protected. Our auditing officials are the same. Therefore, the protection of auditing officials seems to be calling on us to be loyal to our duties and abide by the law. Therefore, this protection is a protection that offends people. Only by protecting auditing officials can we use our authority to do things seriously. Judicial officials adopt a collegiate system for judging cases to show fairness, and the existence of the Auditing Conference is also for this purpose. Another aspect of the organization of the Auditing Bu is its directly subordinate auditing office. The organization of the auditing office is divided into four groups: the first group is in charge of pre-audit, the second group is in charge of post-audit, the third group is in charge of inspection, and the fourth group is in charge of general affairs. The director of this office is concurrently held by an auditing officer stationed abroad from the Bu, and the group leaders are concurrently held by associate auditing officers and inspectors stationed abroad from the Bu. Currently, the Auditing Bu is planning to establish auditing offices in Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and other places. For agencies that cannot be divided by region, auditing offices will be established uniformly. The division of authority between the provincial auditing offices and the departments of the Bu is that the departments of the Auditing Bu summarize the auditing reports of the auditing offices in various provinces and cities across the country, while the auditing offices directly carry out auditing matters. I wrote an article entitled "A Study of the Organization of the Auditing Office" in the Auditing Special Issue of the Central Daily News, which discusses this in detail.</p>
<p>(III) The Methods of Auditing in China</p>
<p>I have talked about the authority and organization of auditing, now I will talk about the methods of auditing, which are divided into two types: submitting for audit and on-site audit. The method of auditing is of course mainly auditing accounts, and there is also a method of reimbursement. This method of reimbursement already existed in the Song Dynasty and was most prevalent in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The method of reimbursement has its advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is that it cannot clearly understand the actual situation of financial operations and is prone to fraud. The advantage is that it is suitable for lower-level small agencies. Because the income and expenditure of small agencies are very small, the reimbursement method can avoid the trouble of many piecemeal procedures. The purpose of on-site audit is to prevent fraud. Now, due to time constraints, I cannot talk too much, but finally, I have a word to declare: in my years of work in the Auditing Bu, I have felt many difficulties because the auditing authority cannot be fully exercised, but I can only be more patient and strive to overcome these difficulties. We must recognize that the authority of the Auditing Bu is very important. If the auditing agency cannot exercise its authority, then there is no way for finance; if there is no way for finance, then there is no way for the country. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Financial News: Chinese and Foreign Banks Closed for Holidays <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow (the 25th) is the Western holiday of the Winter Solstice, also known as Christmas. Chinese and foreign banks on the Bund will be closed as usual to celebrate. It is reported that all foreign banks will be closed for two days, the 25th and 26th, and will resume business as usual on the 27th. Chinese banks, except for banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, will also follow suit and close. All other banks, from the Central Bank downwards, will operate as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Call Loan Rate Still at Four Corners <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Corner Coin Slightly Downward</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, so the foreign exchange market was unusually quiet. The call loan rate was still at four corners, the same as the previous day, due to the end of the year and the inevitable slight tightening of funds. The turnover of call loan transactions was more than 2.3 million in the morning session and more than 500,000 in new transactions. The afternoon session saw a turnover of more than 600,000. The Shanghai Bankers' Association collected and remitted more than 31 million in foreign currency, and remittances from various routes amounted to more than 400,000. In addition, due to the bank holiday, all collection and remittance activities were suspended. The market for subsidiary coins tended to decline. Jiangnan small coins were both 842.5 yuan in the morning and afternoon sessions, a decrease of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day, with turnovers of 4,000 coins in the morning session and 2,000 coins in the afternoon session. Guangdong small coins were 761.2 yuan in the morning session and 761 yuan in the afternoon session, a decrease of 2.2 yuan compared to the previous day, with turnovers of 90,000 coins in the morning session and 95,000 coins in the afternoon session. Copper coins were 304,000 cash, with a turnover of 36,480 strings of cash, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>| Results in Increases Ranging from Several Corners to 1.34 Yuan |</p>
<p>Last week, from December 17th to 22nd, the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced extremely turbulent conditions. Government bonds were subjected to various shocks and fluctuated repeatedly, resulting in a chaotic situation where prices sometimes rose when they should have fallen and vice versa. Rumors such as the devaluation of silver coins and inflation were most misleading and aroused suspicion. Even economic experts found it difficult to make definitive statements, so the market appeared somewhat chaotic. Credit remained tight, and foreign exchange rates continued to rise. Capitalists bought foreign exchange, but retail investors were even more enthusiastic about buying bonds and engaging in arbitrage transactions. Large short sellers initially remained stubborn as ever, but eventually covered their positions due to the favorable interest rates. The short-selling wall was shaken, and market conditions improved. The gloom of many days was swept away without a trace. Recently, there have been rumors of issuing customs gold banknotes and silver loans, with various pieces of news coming one after another. In short, currency reform is already an irreversible fact, but the time is not yet ripe. The government bond market was most affected by these shocks, so there are many fluctuations ahead. Last week, on Monday, the foreign call loan rate rose as high as 2.8 points. Sixteen and fifty-three numbers continued to be sold off, and the market fell sharply in the morning session, reaching its lowest price in recent months. In the afternoon, rumors of silver devaluation and other factors led to a frenzied surge of one yuan to one and a half yuan. Numbers four and twenty-one saw significant gains. This was one of the most chaotic periods in market prices since the initial currency system problems. On Tuesday, the foreign call loan rate rose again, and rumors persisted. Financial institutions bought in, and prices rose several corners to two yuan. On Wednesday, after Finance Minister Kong refuted the rumors, public sentiment stabilized somewhat, but number sixteen saw some covering. Market prices recovered by a small number of corners to more than one yuan. On Thursday, the foreign call loan rate rose to three corners and a half. As rumors of Hu Lai's news became increasingly confirmed, large short sellers gradually covered their positions, recovering seven or eight corners. On Friday, the foreign call loan rate rose to four corners. Number sixteen saw particularly strong covering. Buying pressure also outweighed selling pressure in the market. Floating surpluses were rare, and market conditions were stable, with slight gains of two or three corners. On Saturday, Mr. Wang Chonghui stated that unity for the future was gradually taking shape. There were also rumors of silver loans in the market. Large institutions bought in and covered positions very enthusiastically. Sellers became increasingly scarce, and the upward trend gradually strengthened. Gains were estimated at several corners to one yuan. The tightness of credit in the future is temporary and should not have a significant impact. Retail investors mostly believe that currency reform is beneficial to government bonds, so they continued to buy strongly. Their potential should not be underestimated, and they have the potential to defeat large institutions. Therefore, there is a gradual improvement in the hope for the future. There are only two days left in this month's futures contracts, and the squeeze may still be unavoidable. As a result of last week's market prices, gains ranged from several corners to 1.34 yuan. The total transaction volume was 151,294,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e203">The Scarlet Detective Case <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Sui Yuan Zi</p>
<p>I have not studied detective science, nor have I seen Sherlock Holmes' detective cases, so I have absolutely no qualifications to criticize the technical aspects of detective work. However, I find a recently occurred scarlet detective case in Japan quite interesting, so I will briefly describe its outline to provide those who study detective work with a reference material.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo correspondent of a certain newspaper, recently in Tokyo, eighteen Japanese women were found to be enamored with a naval lieutenant, Detlev Schmelck, a military attaché at the embassy of a certain country in Tokyo. The lieutenant used these women as assistants to spy on Japanese military and national affairs, in order to achieve his espionage purposes. Such a romantic and bizarre detective case is rarely heard of in history, and must be said to be an interesting scarlet detective case, and worthy of study by the general public.</p>
<p>Among these eighteen women, the ones most deeply immersed in the sea of love and most willing to assist the lieutenant were Haruko Tanikawa, Asako Nishizaki, Minako Hasegawa, Miyako Tomikashiwa, Akiko Hachisuka, Fuyuko Kadonashi, and Kiyoko Ashikawa, among other beauties. Tanikawa is currently the wife of a high-ranking official. After meeting the lieutenant, their affection deepened day by day, ultimately forming an unbreakable bond, and she made the greatest effort in collecting Japanese military books. Asako Nishizaki is a graduate of a certain women's college in Tokyo, studied in Europe, and is now the wife of a university professor. Since meeting the lieutenant, she fell for his handsome appearance, and a thread of affection was secretly woven. The lieutenant used Mrs. Nishizaki's social status to collect various intelligence. Minako Hasegawa graduated from a women's vocational school and was a Japanese language teacher for foreigners. This group of women were mostly touched by the lieutenant's appearance and money, falling in love with him. The lieutenant catered to this group of women on all fronts, while secretly exercising his skills, and he must be praised as a superb detective. Therefore, I have two impressions:</p>
<p>(1) Although our country is known as a country of multiple wives, a man with two or three concubines often cannot handle them properly, causing domestic turmoil and marital strife. However, the lieutenant was able to navigate between eighteen women, handling them with ease and satisfying everyone. The lieutenant is not only a seasoned detective, but also a specialist in stealing jade. The exposure of this case was due to Hachisuka demanding subsidies from the lieutenant, which were not granted. She severed all relations and reported to the Tokyo Military Police, thus completely exposing the truth of the case. This was originally due to the lieutenant's momentary negligence, which is a pity.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese are known for their skillful use of the "beauty trap," so they often use women as spies to investigate the national and military affairs of various countries. Now, the lieutenant turned the tables, using Japanese women to spy on Japanese military and national affairs, which was initially beyond anyone's expectations. In particular, the women used by the lieutenant were not just ordinary women, but wives of high-ranking officials or university professors. I cannot help but deeply admire his skillful hands in stealing fragrances and his detective skills.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Fuzi <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Once the lights are lit at dusk, I stand by the window, whistling the out-of-date tune of Ramona, and then silently think of Fuzi living in the neon lights! Amidst the mixed sounds of flowing metallic musical instruments!</p>
<p>I think about Fuzi a lot, but never as strongly and with as much wistful longing as when dusk descends!</p>
<p>Ah, Fuzi, my spiritual goddess of love!</p>
<p>I often say to myself secretly, just for myself, not daring to let others know, because others would laugh at my incompetence for falling in love with such a commercialized woman. But I really do love Fuzi. But even in front of Fuzi, I have never firmly said: Fuzi, I am passionately in love with you! My silent love is because I am afraid that Fuzi would pretend to be ignorant and give me a disappointing answer. I really don't want to experience this pain. So I would rather let my silent love thoughts hide silently in my heart, not letting anyone know, not even Fuzi. But I believe that Fuzi will one day know it herself.</p>
<p>Ah, I have been silently loving you these days too!</p>
<p>Fuzi will one day say this understandingly, I imagine, my unknown love must have a time to blossom naturally.</p>
<p>And now I am often idly suffering, because Fuzi still doesn't know that I am in love with her. Now I can meet her almost every day. Although the words hidden in my heart could not be finished even if I spoke all night. But outwardly, I don't want to say a word.</p>
<p>When dancing, under the dreamlike dim red lights, Fuzi's words are most repetitive, she would question:</p>
<p>Why do you always come alone?</p>
<p>I like the life of solitude.</p>
<p>Fuzi seemed a little puzzled when she heard this, but she warmly and intimately fixed her eyes, which contained boundless young girl secrets, on my face. She asked many things in a beautiful and melodious voice. I only nodded frequently, or uttered a sound after a long time.</p>
<p>Fuzi might think I am very strange. Why do I always come alone, and every time I come, I always dance with Fuzi alone? Yes, I like to live a solitary life, and I prefer to immerse myself in a kind of solitary, silent love that is not easily known to others. Fuzi might understand a little. Even if she doesn't understand, I am willing for my solitary love to grow silently from my heart and wither silently.</p>
<p>Is it also loving me as I love you! Fuzi,</p>
<p>Several times I almost said it, Fuzi saw the different expression on my face and immediately asked me sensitively:</p>
<p>You seem to want to say something, why don't you say it?</p>
<p>The words had already reached my lips, but with this question, somehow, they were swallowed along with a mouthful of saliva. Thus, I only stared at Fuzi blankly in distress, and Fuzi cried softly, not quite understanding.</p>
<p>Fuzi, you will always see my thoughts one day, right? However, my silent love is worried about this, ah!</p>
<p>I am very clear that Fuzi already has a different and special feeling for me, just like I have for her. I think that some things that I consider inappropriate to say may be things that she thinks are okay to say, or things that she wants to say but can't say. Because when she is dancing with others, Fuzi's expression and words are obviously different, and I have carefully noticed it. She often dances with others for a while, and when she dances with me, her attitude becomes more sincere, and on the other hand, she reveals a kind of uneasy restraint, as if she is regretting that this kind of thing is unavoidable.</p>
<p>But I have not paid attention to this. I just continue to cherish my silent and solitary love.</p>
<p>One day I will let Fuzi know, I expect this.</p>

<p>— Shi Xing</p>
<p>(2) The Gambler's Heart</p>
<p>Opening the door and seeing my wife's joyful face, smiling in the warm winter sun, my anxious heart finally calmed down. My wife had gone back to her parents' home to borrow money. Since she had a joyful face, she must not have been refused?</p>
<p>"Did you get it?"</p>
<p>My wife, sitting down on the bed, trembled and struggled to pull out two five-yuan bills from her pocket.</p>
<p>"Only ten yuan?" The heart that was just happy couldn't help but become indifferent again.</p>
<p>"Ten yuan is not enough. Didn't you say that fifteen yuan would be enough to get by? They only have twenty yuan, how could I have the nerve to take more?" As she said, she laughed hysterically. "Look, aren't these five-yuan bills? Aren't they brand new Central Bank notes?" It turned out that my wife's joy was only the joy of not having</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>received a five-yuan bill for a long time, and suddenly receiving one today, not the joy of solving the life that was pressing down on us tomorrow.</p>
<p>Holding those two Central Bank notes, feelings of shame, apology, and sorrow spread in my heart. Finally, in the evening, I became indignant about my fate:</p>
<p>"Ten yuan is not enough to cope with, let's just go to the Jai Alai court to gamble. If we are lucky, we might win five yuan back."</p>
<p>"What if we lose?"</p>
<p>"We won't lose ten yuan in the end, if we are careful."</p>
<p>My wife pinched those two bills, remained silent for a while, and then said, "Okay!"</p>
<p>On the way, my old wife kept urging me to use a little reason, and I replied so confidently: "What are you afraid of? Isn't our desire very small? Isn't it only the desire for five yuan?" But after losing four yuan at the Jai Alai court, I couldn't help but blush, and I ran to buy the number three win for six yuan. My wife asked me what number I bought? I just lied and said I bought a number three seat.</p>
<p>The announcer blew the whistle, and my heart jumped for no reason: Number three scored four points as soon as it came up, and the tickets in my hand were all soaked with cold sweat. My mouth twitched and I said to my wife, "Look, I bought three tickets!"</p>
<p>"I hope our ancestors will bless us." She stretched out her cold hand and grabbed my hand.</p>
<p>But number three was finally beaten down by number two, and I felt that even my eyebrows were twitching involuntarily. Number two easily scored five points in a row, so my whole body trembled and I stood up.</p>
<p>My wife looked at my face and said, "Let's go back early."</p>
<p>We walked out silently, and when we walked on the deserted Route Lafayette and were blown by the biting north wind, my wife finally cried softly.</p>

<p>Opening "Song of Well-Being"</p>
<p>The ancients all say gold is good. The evil of gold is terrible. False righteousness and false benevolence are tricks of the heart. Grabbing profits and fighting for power with a smile behind a knife. For whom does the killing begin in the same room? Brothers fight on the wall, siblings abandon each other. Estate disputes reach the court. Deep feelings of flesh and blood cause a storm. Husband and wife are originally birds of the same forest. Rice, firewood, wine, and vinegar cause trouble. The world is busy and endlessly suffering. Who dares to escape at the juncture of fame and wealth? People all say beauties are good. The pink skull is terrible. The red lights and green wine are originally a dream. I, I, you, you, the soul is about to melt. Welcoming and sending off are all false. Strangers are born and die morning and evening. The graceful and charming posture of a beautiful woman. Toppling cities and countries. Since ancient times, amorous scholars say fame is good. Wealth is a fleeting cloud, terrible. Kneeling and flattering to entrust opportunities. Bribes are boring night and day. Feng Xuan flicks his sword, few close friends. Mencius's legacy is of noble character. Ten years of studying by the window is in vain. Who invites extreme prosperity and decline? Burning the zither and boiling the crane to leave the hometown. Two sleeves of clear wind and a leaf (boat). Lonely souls in a foreign land have difficulty finding food. Fame has exhausted the long road. People all say children and grandchildren are good. Children and grandchildren who are horses and cattle are terrible. In the embrace for three years, mother loves painfully. Adding clothes to keep warm, asking morning and evening. Reading books and going to school, righteous precepts and training. Reviewing the old and knowing the new, night class labor. Clothing, food, and shelter are all provided. All kinds of needs are wordy. Daughters marry and sons marry, the responsibility is heavy. Money is spent on thousands of skewers. Rearing the living and burying the dead is difficult to fulfill. Serving parents with coarse food and water is a heartfelt matter. (Can't see enough) Everything in the world is mostly false. Stealing a lifetime is also a trivial matter. (It is better to) Enjoy pleasure in time with the wind and rain.</p>

<p>Opening "Suzhou Modern Young Women"</p>
<p>Famous ladies under Wu are of the best quality. Young people are very ambitious in seeking knowledge. Hairpins and jade pendants are naturally beautiful. Romance does not love modern dress. Some are like orchids in a secluded valley, delicate and about to speak. Some are like peonies, dyeing the sky with national colors. Even more, there are those as beautiful as peach blossoms, cold as frost, and never seen like dandelion flowers, revealing frivolity. Occasionally stepping into the social scene. Interacting with men of letters and scholars. Enlightening new knowledge and adding more secrets. Revisiting old knowledge and spending a lot of time. Poetry, painting, and calligraphy are all precious. Morality, intelligence, and physical education are even more comprehensive. Sometimes referring to the library. Sometimes playing ball in the sports field. Sometimes a clear song wraps around the painted beam. On weekends, strolling in the park, riding a green horse along the green embankment. Sisters on bicycles form a brilliant line. Happily meeting lovers to tell their hearts. Swallows sing and orioles send off the setting sun. Virtuous women are early familiar with poetry and etiquette. Therefore, happiness is not excessive and sorrow is not harmful. The future is related to new life. Do not casually match phoenixes. It is almost certainly happiness forever without borders.</p>

<p>— Mi Tong</p>
<p>Today's Star is Yesterday's Extra</p>
<p>Advising You Not to Be Discouraged, Hard Work is the Path to Success</p>
<p>Let us turn the clock back丨丨to many years ago. There, in a dirty back street of New York, at the back door of a small, low house, sat a poorly dressed, malnourished girl, weeping on the steps. As she thought about the pain of being scolded and beaten, she wondered what death tasted like. She lost her parents when she was young and never received affection from anyone. She couldn't imagine anyone in the world ever caring for her. Growing up to twelve years old, all she felt was hard work day and night, hunger, beatings, endless bullying, and wearing clothes that people had thrown away. Who would have thought that Ruby Stevens, as she was known then, would become Barbara Stanwyck, the famous female star and idol worshiped by millions of movie fans?</p>
<p>Here is another example. In the dining hall of a sports club in Los Angeles, a young waiter was clearing the leftover cups and dishes from each table. One of the members pointed at the waiter and said to his companion, "Look, that Mexican kid is learning to sing and dance every day. He wants to be a movie star in the future. Don't you think it's ridiculous?" They laughed as they spoke. At that time, of course, it was ridiculous—a child doing menial work, yet harboring the ambition to become a movie star. But that Raman Samaniegos was none other than Ramon Novarro, who is now famous worldwide. Ramon Novarro has been a star for perhaps one or two decades, both in the silent and sound film eras, and hardly needs a detailed introduction.</p>
<p>The above are just two examples to prove our old saying: "They can do it, so why can't I?" Of course, you can! So many success stories in Hollywood are attributed to the goddess of luck. Where the goddess of luck has played a role, she must of course be credited. But, besides luck, unstoppable ambition, unwavering determination, fighting adversity, working, and working without interruption have united to lift nine out of ten stars high above the blue sky. Among the extras, you can find countless young men and women who will become the future Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Eddie Cantor, and Grace Moore. The current Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Eddie Cantor, Grace Moore, and so on, are of course dazzling and unapproachable, but when they started, were they any brighter than Tom, Mary, Dick, Betty, and others living in small houses next door? Many, in fact, most stars, started from hardship, went through hardship, and then achieved their amazing success today.</p>
<p>They became stars today because they had courage and determination, ignored all obstacles, pushed forward permanently, never retreated, or turned back after encountering some setbacks. And because they were still working and studying while others were enjoying leisure. If you want to study the success stories of great people, it is better to look at the success stories of movie stars, which are closer to reality and easier to emulate. Let's not talk about others. Let's take the recently deceased old movie queen, Marie Dressler, as an example. When it comes to the qualifications for being a movie star, anyone would have been better than the young Mary Koeber (her original name). Most of her life was a constant struggle, and her reward was a glorious victory. Her family's poverty prevented her from even graduating from elementary school, but she was able to read newspapers, study, and judge the psychology of the people she met, becoming a woman of high insight who could be friends with the successive presidents of the United States and talk to all the writers, educators, financiers, etc., while understanding their deepest thoughts. In terms of appearance, she was ugly and extremely burly. These two conditions alone should have disqualified her from becoming a star. But Marie was able to use these two shortcomings to struggle for survival. For decades, she finally succeeded in her later years as a unique comedian that no one could imitate. Many times, she was abandoned by luck, felt that everything was over, and was trapped in the sea of unemployment, penniless, and with many relatives and friends relying on her, making it impossible for her to escape. But she never accepted that failure was her fate. She repeatedly counterattacked. She repeatedly staged a comeback. When she arrived in Hollywood丨丨this film capital that admired beauty丨丨she was already an old and ugly woman. But she became the greatest figure on the screen, the most beloved female star in the world. Even before her death, after being terminally ill, she continued to fight for two years and made immortal works in history. Who can say that her success was the creation of luck?

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e212">Review of "My Song for You" <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>MysSongForYou丨Great Shanghai</p>
<p>I remember a movie called "A Song For You," also starring Jack Pula, that was shown in Nanjing before. This "My Song for You" is roughly the same story as the previous one, and the content of the songs is not much different either. There would have been no need to mention it here except to indicate that the producers were very concerned about guaranteeing profits, but it is briefly mentioned to remind the audience. And we have not forgotten the great success of "A Song For You" at the Nanjing Grand Theater.</p>
<p>In this film, naturally, Jack Pula's "golden voice" is entirely used as a business attraction, and the script is written for the lead actor. This is common practice under the star system of European and American films. At the same time, apart from a few loud songs, there is almost nothing else, and this is something the screenwriter can disregard. As for the unrealistic nature of "My Song for You," there is no denying it.</p>
<p>As a vocalist, we will never forget Jack Pula's "Tell Me Tonight." In that film, the beautiful scenery and the soft melody completely intoxicated people. In an era when musical films were popular, it should be a commemorative work. Although it was just a beautiful love song, it did not have significant value in content.</p>
<p>Compared to "My Song for You," "Tell Me Tonight" is undoubtedly much better. But here it can be said to be more realistic. Fast rhythms, lighthearted gags, graceful songs, and happy laughter form this lighthearted work. Regardless of whether the plot is an unrealistic portrayal, and regardless of whether it cannot deeply stimulate people's emotions, it does make people laugh heartily under the loud singing, which is fully achieved, and director Maurice Elvey has certainly done a satisfactory job.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Review of "Voice in the Night" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>VoiceintheNight丨Carlton丨</p>
<p>Amidst the smoky atmosphere created by old and vulgar detective films and mediocre and clumsy martial arts dramas, we have once again seen this so-called martial arts enthusiasm combined with a detective nature, "Voice in the Night." From the performance aspect, this is slightly better than certain detective and martial arts films. It has dangerous fights in the air over deep cliffs and abysses. Struggles in fierce winds, rainstorms, and landslides. And these tense, enthusiastic, and critical scenes of tearing and fighting. In other words, it relies on sufficient money and photographic technology! Material conditions and scientific power create some crises and urgencies, strongly and urgently arousing some of the audience's emotions. Compared to mediocre detective cases or childish fights, it has a bit more stimulation.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot say that this film is perfect and good just because it has the above-mentioned strong stimulation. If these do not exist and develop based on a sound story and a tight structure. So, what is the story that serves as the main content of "Voice in the Night" like?</p>
<p>It tells the story of Tan Er, a young, handsome, and talented man who works at his father's telephone company. He is suspended from his job because he saved the life of a worker, which interfered with public affairs. During a basketball game, an enemy player is injured. By chance, while borrowing a phone to find a doctor, he repairs the generator of the Ditong Company and gets to know Pa Pei, the manager's daughter. However, the company's manager, Lu Bin, is his father's strong business rival, and a cunning lawyer, Bai Deng, is helping his father to undermine the other party in order to obtain the telephone business patent for a certain valley. The plot develops from here: In the midst of his infatuation with Pa Pei, Tan Er helps Lu Bin drive away the so-called bad guys who destroyed the Ditong cable junction! The author here puts aside his father's instigator, the lawyer, changes his name and surname, and starts working for Ditong. Later, Bai Deng sends someone to kidnap Pa Pei and personally blows up Ditong's newly built generator and river bank on a cliffside. Tan Er loyally dedicates himself to Ditong regardless of life and death. He rescues Pa Pei in the wind and rain, blocks the river in the raging currents, and captures the traitor. The playwright even brings out his own argument that the villain, such as the lawyer Bai Deng, is killed by the electric pole he destroyed, while the so-called good people, such as Tan Er, marry the young lady, and the two in-laws merge their companies, resulting in a happy ending.</p>
<p>There are countless errors in the theme and structure here. The biggest is the ambiguous and fictitious nature of the protagonist Tan Er's position and personality. As for the fact that Lu Bin, as the manager, would personally rush to protect the line at the junction and allow the thugs to beat him, and then be rescued by Tan Er, and that Bai Deng, the instigator of the case, would hire many bad guys to specialize in sabotage and also go to blow up the generator and the river bank himself, it is simply too far-fetched. The screenwriter handles this simple story in such a way that some parts are unclear, and the director follows the screen by showing some so-called melodies and systematic pictures in a messy and fragmented way. Apart from the dangerous fights, and the crises and horrors created by the strong sound effects, and the rain and water splashing, the best part is the section centered on the fast movements of the telephone operator, reprinting those high-speed scenes of floods, fires, and earthquakes. Perhaps it is because they are too enthusiastic about creating so-called stimulation that they overuse the horseback golf battle and the car chase and escape for too long.</p>
<p>The actors are very hardworking. The lead actor, Ding Mai Gai, is limited by the script and has not achieved outstanding results, but only acts in many lively and tense scenes in a lively and superficial way.</p>

<p>The giant film "Song of China," praised by public opinion, has been showing at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater recently, and there has not been a day without a full house. This is because the film is so sorrowful and moving that many viewers secretly wipe away tears in the dark. When the lights come on at the end of the film, many in the audience have red eyes. The film depicts the tragic encounters of a young couple in the whirlpool of unemployment and is intended to criticize the evils of the social system, so it is deeply able to win the sympathy of the public and earn many tears. The film is produced by Diantong Company, and the expressions, sounds, light, and makeup are all excellent, and even imported films are probably no more than this. It is said that the theater is crowded with giant films and has to shorten the screening period to only today. Those who wish to see it must not miss this good opportunity.</p>

<p>Modern dance halls are flourishing with all kinds of performances, and "New Woman," with such a grand setting, naturally cannot lack this kind of insertion. However, the performance under the artist's hand is not as simple as just increasing the audience's pleasure and delight. The performances of those songs and dances in "New Woman" are not only extraordinary but also have profound meanings. It is said that the insertion had to go through a long period of selection beforehand before the few outstanding dancers were chosen, and they were specially rehearsed and expensive costumes were specially made for them, and it was not just a matter of casually pulling in a few ordinary dancers to liven up the atmosphere.</p>

<p>— Shu Min</p>
<p>Although Sally immediately explained and clarified her intentions, it was only to help him. However, in his anger, Jimmy couldn't hear what she was saying. He ran to the door, turned back to Sally, and said, "From now on, don't ever think about seeing me again." After he said that, he rushed out. After Jimmy left, as Sally was lamenting her poor fate, the phone rang. Sally hurried to answer the phone, thinking it was Jimmy calling, or that he had repented. But when she picked up the phone and listened, her hopes were immediately dashed. The caller was Doctor Spear. At this time, Joan and Gus had already entered, but they didn't know they had come in while Sally was talking to Doctor Spear. They only heard Sally saying to the phone, "I'm not going to have the operation... I've decided not to go... Thank you for your kindness, doctor." After she said that, she put the phone down, looking nonchalant. Joan quickly took a step forward and asked Sally, "What's wrong with you? Have you gone crazy?" Sally sighed, shook her head, and told them everything weakly. After she finished speaking, the tears in her eyes were about to burst out. She couldn't hold back any longer, and she ran to her bedroom. Joan looked at Gus helplessly. Suddenly, she thought of a plan. It was what Gus had told her before. That is, the race day is approaching, and there is a horse called "Thunderbolt" that is sure to win first place, but it has not entered the race this season. In addition, there is another horse called "Wait for Me" that is a famous weak horse and has never won once. But the two horses look very similar. If they could get "Thunderbolt" and slightly disguise it to look like "Wait for Me" and enter it in the race, no one would buy its tickets, and they would bet on the dark horse alone, wouldn't they make a fortune? So Joan discussed it with Gus, thinking that it was better to act quickly and prepare immediately. So they started to implement it, not thinking that the jockey knew their plan and secretly calculated against them. What they got was not "Thunderbolt," but another old horse. But Gus didn't know that, and he spent a lot of effort to dress the old horse as "Wait for Me." He also bet all his money on that horse. When the race day came, Sally, Joan, and Gus all arrived. Sally was also holding her dog. They eagerly watched "Wait for Me" walk in front. They thought they would definitely win. Unexpectedly, when turning the corner, the horse suddenly didn't follow the circle but jumped over the fence and ran away. As they were panicking, Sally's dog suddenly jumped out of Sally's arms and ran straight forward. It burrowed into a crowd of people for a while. Gus hurried after it and only saw the dog barking madly at one person and biting that person's heel hard. Gus was about to apologize to that person when that person raised a hand to chase the dog. Gus immediately saw a tattoo on his arm, which looked exactly like a silver dollar. Gus understood in his heart. He decided on a method, deliberately quarreled with that person, and grabbed that person and beat him. So they fought in the crowd. Gus's intention was to wait for the police to come. Sure enough, after such a commotion, a policeman came over and arrested them both. After the criminal was caught, of course, the manager of the ice cream company, Xiao Boer, immediately returned Sally's four hundred dollars to her. So Joan persuaded Sally to still use that money to treat her own foot. But at this time, Jimmy had already boarded a ship and gone to sea. What he thought about day and night was not Sally, but how to get the money to pay her back. One day, he returned from overseas. He didn't expect that as soon as he landed, the manager and Gus, etc., were already waiting for him on the shore. Xiao Boer told him the good news of solving the case and gave him a car that the local manager rode in. Gus also told him that Sally was in the hospital having her foot operated on. Hearing this, Jimmy immediately sat in the new car and drove to the hospital gate. But when he arrived at the gate, he couldn't walk in because Sally had heard that Jimmy had returned and, in grief and anger, had discussed with Doctor Spear not to let him in. Later, it was thanks to the amorous Joan that he managed to enter the hospital through the side door. As soon as they met, their joys and sorrows were intertwined, and the rest was self-evident.
